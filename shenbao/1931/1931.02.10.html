<h3>日本無産婦女大會之紛擾</h3>
<p>日本議會中兩黨之爭鬥。方因調停而成立諒解而無産婦女大會之紛擾又接踵而起。可知一國之中。粗暴之舉動。一旦發現則自後之繼而起者必不止一。次初則鬥。毆繼則擾。亂終且至於流。血或更至於動干戈以相戰爭中國人民。素以懦怯忍耐名於世界。亦且由此軌道。以至於演成内戰至今而始有終息之望。若以其他强悍之民族。當其擾亂運程度必不止如此者</p>
<p>古人有言。如朽索之馭六馬。非謂治國者之盡無能而有此景象也蓋以民衆之關係。其來由紛繁而非一道。旣非人力一時所能左右且有更非人力所能及者。雜於其間。故無論在何方法之下。方法未破咸秩然而有序方法旣破則千瘡百孔。因之而並起。雖有智者不能爲謀雖有力者不能相强應付得當則苟延之日稍長應付不得當。則潰敗决裂當時立見此乃世事推運之結果無可如何者。</p>
<p>是故一民族或一國家。當興盛得勢之時。無論何事何物皆人人認爲當然而不必問其所以然。及至一旦間隙旣生。相互之間須用應付之方法則其去衰敗之期也已近。試觀今日世界各國。其對内不用應付方法者能有幾國哉。</p>

<h3>獵虎者言　斅厂</h3>
<p>餘杭北鄉之白鹿山。峯巒起伏。竹密林深。而虎豹之屬。恒出没其間。有甬人邱阿丙者。家於該山之麓上月初。邱之表兄曹某。自奉化來邱家盤桓某日。曹登山遊覽。忽於山腰間瞥見虎之足跡。曹固獵者。見此虎跡。即返奉化取弓箭至。裝於虎跡原處。以備射虎。當晚。即有一虎斃於附近。虎重二百餘斤。售於杭垣某藥舗。</p>
<p>曹旣獲虎。一般好事者紛紛詢其獵虎情形曹曰。獵虎者須識虎之足跡始有所獲。蓋山中虎跡往往現有該虎之行蹤也其行蹤有已遠去須經若干年月後始返於此者。有去此匪遥。數日後即重返者。有僅路過而從此永不復到者有尚在此山。或附近者凡此種種、皆現於足跡也。日前予登白鹿山遊覽。見有虎跡。細辨之。知該虎於前一日蒞此。業已他適。七日後必返。但予此來。未帶弓箭。故即返里取之。及取弓箭至已第七日参。即登山裝設。是晚。虎果返而經此遂爲所獲。曹又曰。射虎之箭賴有毒藥、故能立斃身大力强之虎。藥毒甚然用以射虎。須先縝密試騐。試騐之法。取一巨大之蛙。以針蘸藥少許刺入蛙身。蛙被刺。如不動而立斃則藥方可用以射虎。蓋虎中箭後。必不旋踵而倒斃也。如蛙經若干動而死。則虎必越若干嶺而倒。蓋蛙每一動彈而死。則虎必越一嶺而倒。故蛙如跳躍而死。則虎不知死於何處。而無從覓得其尸矣。曹又曰。虎中箭。血即流出。虎見血。即舔以舌、於是創口之毒。立由其舌而傳入於五内。其亡也忽焉云云。</p>
<h3>書鄧糞翁　荆夢蝶</h3>
<p>鄧子糞翁。名鈍鐵。余十年前老友也。時鎭海倪子軼池創友聲社於滬上。翁與余同爲社員。遂以文字緣結苔岑契焉君性孤癖。習靜惡囂。雖生長海上。而足不履舞榭歌塲。惟嗜杯中物。數年前。有誤傳其醉死者。蓋君所至輒飮。有劉伯倫死便埋我之風趣故爾。居恒以書刻兩事自遣有時臨池得意。輒舉一紙郵示余。其書無體不工。而余尤愛其狂草有春蚓秋　之勢。鴻歸燕起之姿。以余亦喜作草書。而未能工也君復詼奇自喜。所著屁味室吟草。極突梯滑稽之妙。以貧故晚婚。吉夕懸冥鏹紙錠。飾洞房門。其别有懷抱如此。曩余遊滬。識之於社中。（南京路其人質樸雄偉。望之若山僧。又如燕趙壯土。絶不類其書及詩也。顧神交已久。而旣見轉默然。則以君習性不醉不言。而余又天性不飮。故惟有如莊生語。相視而笑。莫逆於心耳。别後承見懷。曾寄我一詩云。「才華吾黨推荆子。文采風流總絶倫。檀板金尊歌舞地。情絲纒住苦吟身。」意以余好顧曲。又時多捧角文字。如芙蓉草劉玉琴粉菊花輩。均有所作也。然自此君居址屢遷。余亦人事栗六。音問不通。忽數載已邇見報載君以書刻展覽。見賞於西神瘦鵑兩公。又皆文以張之。（見上月本談及快活林）余驟覽之下。正如鳴琴阮曲。聽笛嵇隣。感秋水之流光。覺伊人之宛在。又以知君之藝事孟晋。自慚荒落。而益動相思也。爰書舊事。以紀新愁。並和見懷原韻。疊爲兩首云。「蓮社一樽懷老鐵。儘多才藝冠同倫。醉鄉而外曾無地。别有名山寄此身。十年一别成離索。酒德清在憶伯倫。若問樽前舊詞客。萬梅花下老吟身。」（余館無錫申新廠居停榮氏即梅園主人也）想故人見之。當有以慰其飢渴乎。</p>
<h3>金山南鄉之處女劫　晚成</h3>
<p>昨天晤會了幾個自金山南鄉來申的同鄉人。大談本鄉匪亂慘狀。使聞者傷心。晚幾要放聲悲號更狂呼着「我們的故鄉。水深火熱的故鄉。唉。」</p>
<p>金山南鄉。張堰。錢圩。金山衛。干巷。廊下。……一帶。幾成匪世界了。一月之内。一日之間。勒索搶劫。不知有多少起。大隊人馬。青天白日。横行鄉鎭。毫無忌憚。旁若無人。晚說這幾句話。恐怕有人不信。但都是事實。浦南素稱安樂地。乃竟一至於此。眞是我們南鄉人夢想不到的。</p>
<p>最可憐的。如鄉下二八年華的處女。一經土匪庽目。常有被擄强姦强婚的。所以家有年輕姑娘。都躱在家裡。不肯輕意出門。正合古主話「女人藏男人浪」這句話了。上月某晚金山衛東門。土匪擄掠了一個年輕姑娘。姑娘大哭大呌。這土匪就這樣裝腔道。「叫你回去你不回去夜深了、定要我（土匪自稱）來拖你的……」這幾句話。是金山衛的一位朋友告訴我的。原來這悲劇的發生。我的朋友是親聽得的。明天人家都說昨晚哭喊的姑娘。就是被匪擄掠去的。我的朋友才恍然悟了。其他被土匪强奪的不勝記述。小康之家早已喬遷他處。尤其是家有年輕姑娘者。</p>
<p>唉南鄉的處女刦。唉。懦弱的金山民衆唉有維持治安之責者……</p>

<h3>心上温馨（三六八）　　包天笑</h3>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>伊這兩大包的衣服。做的時候。那一件不是最新式的。一共連材料和裁縫工錢。也要花到六七百塊錢吧。誰知拿到典當裏去當時。連一百塊錢也當不到。原來花老六的那種衣服。都是單夾棉襯絨之類。皮的衣服。一件也没有。典當裏的徽州朝奉說。若是有幾件皮衣服。還可以拆造拆造。像那種衣服。簡直是不值錢。還不及鄉下人一件老布棉袍子咧。然而花老六當初做的時候。那一件不花了幾十塊錢。那種材料。什麽法國來的。英國來的。每尺總要五塊六塊錢。每碼總要十幾塊錢。那種外國綢緞店。派了夥計。到各堂子裏去招攬。或是做熟的裁縫司務。新到了一種新式材料。便送上門去。嘴裏又是說得天花亂墜。六小姐。這是剛剛新到。清和坊四小姐剪了一件。迎春坊五小姐搶了一套。遲一點就被他們都搶完了。你從前關照我有什麽新鮮花樣。先拿到你這裡來的。所以特爲給你留下的。一回兒。又說那花樣特别。顔色鮮艶。只有你們幾位時髦的小姐。纔能穿得起咧。一隻炭簍子罩上去。花元春生性就是吃馬屁的。買東西向來不問價錢。還要埋怨人家爲什麽不先拿到我這裏來。可是這個月裏剪兩件。那個月裏剪兩件。到節上算算。洋錢就是七八百。而且裁縫司務還要想出種種新方式來。可以多開伊的工錢。怎麽鑲。怎麽滾。做怎麽樣的紐扣。方纔覺得别緻新鮮。一件衣裳的工錢。就是十幾塊。節上算算。又是二三百。到了一不時髦。不但不值錢。反而覺得討厭可笑。開典當的最怕那種衣服。不要說是現在已經是過去時代的東西了。便是在這個時代。正在出色當行的。你當到典當裏來。又不能把你這衣服。立刻賣掉的。至少要存放十八個月。你想上海地方的做衣裳。刻刻在翻新花樣。上半年所做的衣服。下半年完全不時髦。又翻了新花樣。好像又變了一個時局。又換了一個朝代。這十八個月的有期徒刑滿了以後。又要存放若干月。方纔印包印出去。到了提莊裏。早已憔悴不堪。好似一個囚徒。坐了長監。雖然放出來了。白髮盈顚。已經可以算不是這世界的人了。那種衣服。到了衣莊裏。衣莊老班也是皺眉頭。老老實實的人。不要穿那種花描的衣服。喜歡花描的。也嫌它不時髦。眞是窮不貪。富不愛。</p>

<h3>糧食　標粉狂抬七分强</h3>
<p>▲投機者如醉如狂</p>
<p>▲成交一百四十萬</p>
<p>▲遠期均出二錢關</p>
<p>昨日粉市各月份市面均在激烈狂漲之中、全日成交額之巨大亦堪爲近年來之冠聞上下午共達一百四十餘萬、當時爭競之烈、可以想見、至此種　漲之起因、一爲前月份未福新允許抽現、標準地位、自見穩固繼以澳洲大地震之後、一週來未見洋麥之兜售人心方面以爲　家已無再壓能力最近幾天以長江一帶之客户、因現粉甚高標準則獨廉均函電紛馳、大批購買、至本埠方面做花紗之客户因各物均跟金市高騰、粉價勢須帶高、故買氣亦獨盛積此數種原因、人心遂步步向昂竟有不可抑遏之勢雖廠家仍有出　、彷彿杯水車薪無濟於事二四五月份均曾二錢出關、六份月份之漲勢更盛、結果本月份較前週漲四分半、三月份漲五分二厘半、四五月份張五分七厘半、六月份漲七分二厘半、七月份漲七分半云</p>
<h3>麥價隨標金狂騰</h3>
<p>▲多頭放價硬抬……遠期漲二錢許</p>
<p>昨日期麥亦見異常之狂騰、近期漲度似覺略平遠期則狂漲之限度、竟達二錢左右之巨、至此種漲度之由來與粉市大致相仿蓋買方所懼者厥爲洋麥这套賣、今芝加哥及坎拿大之現洋麥、久　兜售、澳洲因地震之故亦久無問訊、致空方之態度、相見畏縮、買方則氣燄萬丈、一再放硬抬此種意外之狂漲在事實上言彷彿亦爲金價所帶動也、結果本月份較前週漲六分三月份漲八分、四月份漲一錢、五月份漲一錢三分六月份漲一錢八分七月份漲一錢九分云、</p>
<h3>客元有南省銷路</h3>
<p>昨日秈仍無大帮去化統市祗有本街囤户略爲問津市面乃居平正之局、惟客元新有廣厦帮及本　採辦、市價反見挺俏到頭均少、度後因結束在即、市價尚無鉅大出入、亦無十分疲跌之象昨日全市成交江西機晚三百包價十一元四角半、江西機元六百餘包、價十二元七八角云</p>
<h3>標準黄豆飛漲一錢</h3>
<p>▲黄豆　昨日期豆極佳上午開盤後買氣即旺緣上週未大連電告昂日本糧商暢進現豆兼之東三省當局爲維持北滿豆市起見、錫力調劑因此人心大堅、而本埠金市乂青雲直上是以種種市場空氣大佳浮空竭力抵進下午三月期意達四兩八錢三分此次變化之速實出乎意外耳收盤計二月期大八分、三四五月等期均大漲一錢</p>
<p>▲豆餅　昨日餅市隨原料而向上、晨午各盤内地帮與客帮一致暢進、兼之日商與西洋帮在大連市場旰購現餅、故此間空氣之秀、不亞於黄豆全日成交數亦有數萬片結果較上週末、計三月五月份大三分四月份大二分半、六月份大二分七厘半、</p>
<h3>海味干貝貨缺價昂</h3>
<p>干貝街底所存、各檔本甚軋缺、更聞産市邇又暴漲十餘元、若照日匯劃核則辦本加增二十五六兩、致存有手貨之行號莫不乘機居　扳售、昨市兜售中粒高貨價二百四十兩、大粒二百二十八兩三角一百八十五兩、至一百七十七兩、碎粒一百九十二兩、青森百六十五兩烟台貨一百五十三兩、但市雖缺俏、究因價漲太高、客路去化、不免减弱近日除本街略有零星交易外其餘均未採辦云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　乾繭市益呈俏俐</h3>
<p>▲各廠補講原料復業繭本頓漲二三十兩</p>
<p>本埠乾繭存底稀薄市面益呈俏俐、查獻歲後廠經歐銷轉機絲價激漲、繭市隨之步升、未幾歐銷復趨疲滯、絲價慘落而繭市仍趨堅挺、邇來各絲廠分謀復業、補購原料市氣益俏中身繭本須一千零二三十兩、較前頓漲二三十兩云、</p>

<h3>疋頭　新高價層出不窮</h3>
<p>疋頭市面因外匯劇變、銀價低落益甚、兼之紗花騰昂蒸蒸日上、新高價屑出不窮、昨日開價又現破天荒之新紀録獵雁爲四錢零五厘、英干山四錢　葉題書中山呢三錢二分半楊貴妃大回紋二錢力分二厘半、毛絲布均關住不售、津帮搜辦復殷、昨進大紅光斜三十餘件可愛美人、唐太宗均五兩五錢、灰光斜亦已呌至五兩五錢雖落令之月華　、昨亦大見轉機中柄售出二錢零五厘小柄一錢九分半、惟本街態度依然冷淡、祗稍有售出外購進者頗少、良以時近麽曆年關之故行家心思甚昂對於遠期貨大都不肯開出、現貨反有搜進意、所以愈趨愈高、然照昨日東匯計算與現市相差益遠矣、觀察後步貨價一時决難鬆動、嗣後恐更有新高價出現云、</p>

<h3>唐紹儀之談話</h3>
<p>▲陳友仁十三日後晋京</p>
<p>▲唐在滬候孫科等洽商</p>
<p>▲黄埔築港問題無成見</p>
<p>唐紹儀氏、新膺廣東中山縣縣長之命、日前由京返滬、本報記者昨日下午五時、特往唐氏寓所訪問、晤談約二十分鐘、唐氏現年七十有一、精神　鑠、自謂常食素菜、老年人之保養身體、要以少食爲主云、</p>
<p>殊有至理、</p>
<p>▲晤陳友仁　唐氏謂、陳友仁君來滬、余今午（即昨日）在某素菜館中、與之相值、暢談甚歡、聞陳定本星期五日（即十三日）後晉京、專誠參謁孫陵、及訪晤京中舊友、</p>
<p>▲赴粤行期　余因中山縣之建設、事關桑梓、不以衰老、勉爲效力、但中山縣訓政委員會委員散處各地、召集甚感困難、故擬在滬與孫科·吳鐵城·張惠長·等諸委洽商一切、俟有相當結果、再赴粤就任、故行期尚未能確定、屆時或借孫科同行、吳鐵城君因急須赴東北視察黨務、無暇南行也、</p>
<p>▲中山築港　記者詢以中山與黄埔築港問題、究竟利弊何如、唐氏答稱、中山港余未派員前往測量、自無促加以評斷、故亦毫無成見、黄埔爲河口、築港之經費與人工當極可觀、中山港爲海口、自較便利、英人第一次來華時、即由中山港金星門登陸、兹後運鴉片烟土入境、船隻均停泊於是、</p>
<p>▲桂事見解桂事已大致解决、實現桂人治桂、唐氏之見解云、桂人治桂、固爲吾人之所極端希望者、但桂省本身財政支絀、向由廣東協助、故在清季、設兩廣總督、以粤財政之有裕、補桂之不足、曰協餉、如兩湖、湖北之助湖南、陜甘、陜西之助甘肅、故兹後當注意於協字上、本互助之精神、謀兩廣之發展、否則、廣西無力供給、不得不向外擴展、奪取地盤、而亂無已時云云、</p>

<p>據日本商務參事官事務所、發表去年中日貿易額、共值日金六萬七千七百萬元、内日貨輸華、值三萬九千九百萬元、較諸華貨輸日、值超過一萬二千一百萬元、（約合華幣二萬萬元）、此項超過額、自中國言之、即爲入超、其數竟當華貨輸日總值二分之一、即與日貨輸華總值相比、亦占三分之一、若與上年度相較、日貨輸華額增一萬三千萬元、同時入超亦增四千二百萬元、足見去年我國所購日貨比前年激增二分之一、至日本全部對外貿易、總額共值日金三十一萬九千八百萬元、内輸出占十一萬五千八百萬元、結果入超一萬六千一百萬元、設無對華貿易相挹注、則其入超勢將再增四分之三、可見中日貿易、在日本對外貿易上之重要、再較之上年度、則其輸出值减六萬九千九百萬元、入超减九百萬元、惟考其原因、由於物價低落所致、於數量方面、似無甚顯著之减少云、</p>

<h3>黄浦造橋談</h3>
<p>▲發起原因及開發浦東大計劃</p>
<p>▲浦東開駛長途汽車</p>
<p>▲由塘橋至平湖銜接</p>
<p>▲大陸銀團華僑所組</p>
<p>▲資本歸清還之市府</p>
<p>黄浦江橋之發起、邇來市府當局、殊爲注意、惟對於發起人方面、尚多不明底藴、甚且轉輾誤會者、華東社記者、因於昨日走訪主持此事之發起人姚季重君、姚君爲國民政府建設委員會方席張靜江氏之妻舅、於建設事業、素有研究、當蒙詳細見告、今特彚誌如后、</p>
<p>▲發起原因　姚君謂發起原因尚在去年惟當時擬於首都浦口江面建橋樑、旋因計劃浦口橋樑、而注意及上海深覺上海之與浦口、實屬此善於彼、及將原有計劃移注於滬上、且上海市府當局、正有建設大上海之計劃對於發展浦東亦在預計中、故以爲於黄浦江上建筆橋樑實足促成市府建設大上海之偉業、乃毅然决然、草擬方案積極進行、並於月前呈請市府批准此爲以前籌備經過之大略情形也、</p>
<p>▲開發浦東　至於築橋發起、實爲當時預計劃中之第一步手續、至其目標純爲開發浦東之市面起見、蓋浦東地面遼闊、生産衆多、今祗與滬上一港之隔而盛衰冷落、相差天壤、故姚君等計劃、於第一步手續黄浦江橋完成後即擬從事浦東之交通事業於勘定黄浦江橋之浦東橋基塘橋鎭起、行駛長途汽車經南匯奉賢等縣而至平湖、與浙江省府現已造成之京杭長途汽車相銜接、如是則浦東交通事業旣經完成而所有浦東之生産品便可儘量運輸、以至上海於浦東西之民衆咸有重大利益也、</p>
<p>▲大陸銀團　至於經費一層、在當時早已預算就緒而由大陸銀團爲之籌墊、此大陸銀團有多數借欵與我國官方接洽該團資産可隨時籌集現欵國幣洋一萬萬元其來華投資者蓋亦愛護祖國之故且國府當局亦有歡迎華僑來華投資之奬勵辦法所以不惜以大宗欵項投資祖國、至於黄浦江橋之發起、在該團方面、亦不過爲投資事業之一種耳、</p>
<p>▲建築日期　市府方面、對於此事批准後六個月後、即可正式動工、預計兩年、可以全部造成此僑進行建築中、雖爲商民發起、然與官方仍不脫離、將來工程、並須請市府派員查看、派員監督以期雙方協助、期於盡善盡美之境、</p>
<p>▲還之市府　橋工一旦完成、商民即可任意進出、惟爲歸還發起人之資本起見、須略收通過費、預計須銅元二三枚决不超過現有渡船之渡資、一待所收經費與投資出數相等後發起人即放棄此橋管理權毫無代價、贈之市府、如此則於市府、實可不費分文、成此鉅大建築、而將來浦東之交通旣便、其在市府、亦可平添不少收入也、</p>
<p>▲緊要聲明　姚君末謂、彼等進行此事、實爲發展浦東互助市府完成大上海計劃起見、發起人等於浦東各處、並無絲毫地産、以冀作無謂人空氣而從事投機、此事儘可調查、至於大陸銀關之内幕如何、亦可向上述有關係各方調查明確、至於市府之建設大上海、其發展計劃、雖爲民衆、然市府對於此項經費、亦必發行公債、而後進行、則其負担仍在市民、不過市府當局、促其成功耳今商民方面、旣有此項偉大之供獻、而於地方民衆、絲毫不增加任何負担、將來債權仍當歸之市府、計劃之善、莫逾於此、想自必樂助其成、至謂投機、則立言措辭、必以事實爲依歸、决非　壁虚造者、所可朦蔽於一時也、</p>
<p>▲呈文市府　黄浦江橋之發起籌備及經費來源、旣如上述、發起人等乃於籌備之初、即呈文市府、要求批准、一待批准後、即可　極進行、蓋發起人等、假定業已有充分之準備、苟市</p>
<p>府方面、竟不照准、則發起一切、豈非皆歸泡影前次呈文、於詳述各項外、祗要求先行批准、一待批准後、資本各事、始可確定、然後再即第二度之詳細具報、庶可安心進行、即如計劃黄浦江橋圖樣一事、承辦此事之某國工程師、索價須達六萬元之鉅、今因未曾此准之故、遲遲未能與之訂約、今市府方面、因呈報未詳而有重令詳報之事、刻下令文、雖未接到、惟在日前沈工務局長談話文後、已窺大略、此則因未悉發起人之苦心故也、</p>
<p>▲建築工程　建築工程、現已確由孟阿恩公司承包、正式合同亦均訂立、前當工務局沈局長召集談話時、曾經將該公司正式函件、附帶呈閱、惟沈局長前此談話、謂該公司雖有此意、尚未定奪、此事實屬不確、况圖樣等等、該公司亦經擬就、决定將來由該公司供給材料、承包全部工程、且担保一無危險發生、其式樣與意京康司坦丁最新建之一橋彷彿、此橋工程、亦爲該公司承造、爲全世界所公認便利堅固、將來之黄浦江橋、完全仿照而成、橋共十一節、上並鋪有電車　使浦面電車直達浦東、構造原料、全用鋼鐵可以隨潮漲潮落、自行高低、最高度約六十五尺、最低度約四十五尺、闊約四十六尺、將來是否變更、尚不可知、惟與上述决不致相差懸殊也</p>

<h3>西藏故事集　高碧</h3>
<p>這一册集子包含着四十八個短篇、大都是西藏人流傳談說的故事、英國民俗學家薛爾登博士在西藏考察風俗人情、把它搜集攏來、薛氏死後、他的夫人整理他的遺稿、纔編成這一卷、經胡仲持先生譯成漢文、由開明書店出版、我們可以從這本書得到一些關乎西藏的知識、也從這本書能夠窺測到西藏風俗人情的一斑、這不能不感謝已故薛爾登博士採集之勞、與夫胡仲持先生繙譯之功了、</p>
<p>在未看到本書之前、我曾經幾番跑到坊間去、想找求一些童話之類的書、爲的是要借此鼓起我的孩子們讀書的興味、可是選擇結果、很少有使我滿意的讀物、不是意思太覺牽强、便嫌文字過於生澀、這於兒童脾胃、顯然是不相投合的、根據自已幼時讀書的經騐、我就不敢貿然把它們購買下來、這西藏故事集出版廣告最初映入我的眼廉時、我心上雖曾怦動一次、卻還不想去買這是我的偏見、以爲西藏故事在我漢族人看來未必感到興味、如果再加上詰屈生澀的直譯文字、那就更難使孩子們悅喜了、可是在我一口氣讀完這本書之後、這纔覺得我以前所懸揣的、完全陷入錯誤、原來西藏故事的風味、竟然很配以上我們的胃口、而譯文之宛轉流利、也能隨時增進我們讀書的快感、雖然其中也有幾則故事不易了解、但大部分總是滿意的了、</p>
<p>講到童話、在今日出版界中顯已佔着重要的位置、兒童的性情、本來渾撲天眞最容易吸受外來感應、他們要聽故事的慾望、又是最切迫不過的、我們不注意兒童敎育便罷、如果注意的話、這童話便是唯一補充知識的健將、同時對於是非的暗示、善惡的蘄内、都得利用之收輔導之效、我們祇要回想從前所聽得的故事、對於本身有著如何深刻的影響、就可意識到這童話有怎樣選擇的必要了、本書據薛爾登夫人序卷中說、「這些故事、從父傳於子、從母傳於女、雖然往往充滿着他們的迷信、其中郤也散布着諧謔的風味和道德底眞理的敎訓、是我們所意想不到的」、不錯、這中間果然有不少地方是帶着諧謔的風味和道德底眞理的敎訓的、但是我們還可補充一句、它對於人生的涵義、也很多警關的發揮、有幾篇還只隱躍着諷刺的色采、有幾篇竟是熱烈嘲弄、毫不客氣、</p>
<p>且舉幾個例子、</p>
<p>東「聰明的蝙蝠」裏、有著很雋快的一段、大概說、有一位國王、聽從他妻子的話、要將許多歌唱著的鳥全都割掉了嘴、蝙蝠是懂得内幕的、所以他回答國王的話中、有這麽幾句、「……我的職務是在使男人和女人的數目老是相等、兩方面的死亡率都不致過高、爲的是調節性的問題、」國王問他怎麽辦、他說「……有時候男人比女人多人、有些男人對於女人敎他們做的各種事情一律說著唔唔、以爲女人所說的事情都應該去做、這些男人我就要使他們實成女人、這纔使兩性可以平均了、」國王很　得蝙蝠的話的意思、十分懊惱、結果他對於妻所託的事决計不辦了、</p>
<p>這一段諷刺的寓言、描寫得多麽雋快、多麽鬆脆、我們且看現世間「對於女人敎他們做的各種情事一律說著唔唔、」的那種男人多不多、要否請那位蝙蝠先生來調節一下、</p>
<p>「惡後母」一篇也是帶著沉刻的意味的、但這篇是整個的描寫、必要有完整篇以後、纔能識得它的好處、好在寫「後母」之「惡」、並不從正面形容她的兇狠與陰鷙、不過見得她是善於運用手段、能夠擺布她的丈夫的、同是也見得男人是易於受女人蒙蔽的、</p>
<p>還有一篇呌「結交朋友要看眼睛」的、是一篇有曲折背景的紀事、情節雖然委宛動人、筆墨中間却顯然透露著譏刺的鋒鋩、它的扼要點大概是這樣、</p>
<p>「……一個人臨死時候對他的兒子說……你娶了親、必須等到有十個兒女之後、纔可把自已的秘密事情說給你的知道……他生了第一個兒子以後……把父親的話告訴了他的妻、還添說道、話雖如此、我却相信你是很告得住的、所以有些秘密事情、我還是要告訴你……他用錢買了一隻豬……殺了、脫下自已褲子、把豬脚套進去、……喚他的妻、……我殺了人人啦、……夫妻兩人把它沉到池水裏、……有一天他和妻吵閙起來了……她把自已丈夫殺人的事告發了、……官和他的朋友聽他講述他的父親臨死時候怎樣叮囑、他怎樣試他的妻的心……官說道、你眞是一個聰明人……」</p>
<p>上舉數例、還只是輕鬆的帶諷帶嘲的調子、至如「人的忘恩」「人和猴」等篇、簡直公開的向人類進攻、駡了一個痛快、「人的忘恩」大致是說一個行人從深坑中救出一個人一隻烏鴉一隻老鼠和一條蛇、他們都表示不忘大恩、日後一定來報答他、他輕蔑著烏鴉等所許的友情、以爲那個人或者能夠帮助自已、後來烏鴉等都報了他的恩、能救了他的厄難、那個人郤反忍心地誣陷了他、　　「人和猴」也是一樣地簡單、是說一隻猴子救了一個人的性命、而那個人、郤因爲睡不安穩的緣故、反而害死了猴子、這兩篇把人類褊狹的、自私的、澆薄的、醜惡情性、抉發的淋漓盡致、乾脆一句話、不是在說那種人比畜類還不及麽、我們讀到這裏、眞個不禁毛骨森然、同是圓顱方趾、祇有悚惶、祇有慨息、（還有一篇「烏鴉救獵人」意味深長、彌耐尋思、這裏且不說它）、</p>
<p>除了上述幾點以外、我對這册書、還有一點應當聲說的、就是、其中有好我篇故事雖然没有特别的寄託、郤帶著聰明的渲染、而且繞有異樣的興致的、像「駝人和石頭」「兎殺獅」「老虎和走蛙」「一百兩銀子的官司「獃女壻」等篇、都有著新頴巧妙的結構、是以開發兒童的心機的、這一點在童話的立場上、尤爲必要的條件、因爲童話是要顧到兒童本身的、如果任情地散布一些荒誕無稽的鬼怪的神話、太得不著實際的裨益了、但若一味正經地講求道德敎條、也使他們無法領會、轉嫌枯寂、唯有這樣聰慧的啓導、纔夠他們眞正的受用、</p>
<p>我對於「西藏故事集」介紹的話完了、附帶還得報告一句、每篇故事前附著的西藏諺語、很多名雋可愛、、足供我們借鏡的、讀者不要隨便放過罷、</p>

<h3>日本的姐姐　蕭君</h3>
<p>與曠場爲隣、門前有一口小小的方井的人家、幼小就認識了、到了盛夏六月天氣、差不多天天要在太陽没落的時候、常常是跑到那裏去頑一次回來、好像給我的興趣同功課是兩樣、當時是不曾這樣推究過、只　得那裏有伴、比悶在家裏好頑些、</p>
<p>無論怎樣都要跑到那裏去、似乎成了支配幼小人的心理、穿件白白的背心趿着鞋子、走過一條距離很短的小巷、就望到門前站了兩個孩子、臨着柳葉摇曳輕輕拂動的凉風、一個是十三四歲的漪牽着她弟弟的小手向我遠遠的打着招呼、弟弟也灑脫了漪的手蹤跳的跑到我的近前來、</p>
<p>「芷哥、天快黑了你才捨得出來」、我一壁揉摸他如灰麫揑的手掌、不答說、笑盈盈的只被他拉到與漪相近的地位、漪看到弟弟嬌憨的形態、也抿着一顆櫻桃大小的嘴唇笑了、</p>
<p>「弟弟望你來、望得很急哩」、說了、又把靈活的眼珠斜斜的掠了弟弟一下、那時心中好像她一凝眸斜睇、就會把全天不快意的事體通通會忘記似的想到、竟比在課堂裏、那先生惡得使人窒息的面孔好看一萬倍、不然、我怎一見她就會體會到愉快哩、那時的心情是而今不容易追摹到的、想起來也如隔了一層薄薄的朝霧、</p>
<p>「呵、是要我告他摺紙船頑嗎」、我憑着經騐這樣說、</p>
<p>「不是的、是要你　　吹簫」、</p>
<p>「那容易。波你跟我來、」轉着嗗㖨的眼珠的弟弟、聽着我說是容易、他就跟着我進來、漪走前面、鼕鼕的跑到走過一條長廊的樓上去、弟弟倒成了狠温順的樣子、聽着漪把簫放在嘴唇適當的地方也能嗚嗚成聲、這可急了、</p>
<p>「芷哥、我一定要拜你做師傅、你把我敎會來、」</p>
<p>「好好、你用心聽、」接過簫後、我就把自已認爲吹得最嫻熟最好聽的、譜出來、漪凭着欄杄低低的唱着合　的詞調、波也把頭歪着出神了、這是一種净化的美、雖然、都在　小的年齡裏、全都爲那劃着長空幽幽的不高不低的聲音傾心、到最未一節的時候、波才踊躍起來、快活得像一隻小狗、說我能吹漪姆所不能吹的調子、</p>
<p>漪、也笑、趁此時爲簫引誘得發狂的波執着我的手、往空中蕩了幾蕩、非要把他敎得會吹不可、我被這天眞的小朋友包圍了、於是、從旁指點他、不要使勁、輕輕的用嘴唇嘘送一點氣進去、以手指着或是開放、就包管聽得出一縷聲音了、按照、我所說的話去做、聰明的波、也很容易的學會了、馬上敎他練習音階、簡單的只有七個字、讓他反覆的在那兒吹奏不會妨碍我和漪的談話了、</p>
<p>漪說、「我母親在日本帶了一支尺八來、很細、不好吹、可是、聽起來也甚是動聽、」</p>
<p>當時我只知道這也是屬於簫一類的樂器、並没有怎麽樣的常識、能夠得各國音樂的名字、所以、只唯唯的聽了、又談到她母親在日本的生活來、</p>
<p>她母親、本來是隸屬日本國籍之下一個東京婦人、住在小石川區那地方、現在好像也凤有遺忘、她是一個狠温和的幽雅而富有東方風度的婦人、外婆是開着一爿小小的酒家、據說、她父親在那裏留學的時候、便認識的、</p>
<p>在他們没有生出來的時候、她母親還帮同他外婆料理店子哩、過了不久、他們也想去一趟、這時、他們母親敎他們唱日本歌、問或也吹一曲尺八到他們聽、但、他們總覺得没有我吹的簫好、這不知道是什麽緣故、當時、我心中暗地裏這麽想、如若他們在日本居住、也一定會說尺　好聽罷、</p>
<p>漸漸的、波也能吹出簡單的歌調來、每次到那裏去的時候、總看見他在黄昏的天宇下倚着那一棵三人合抱的柳樹、吹着簫、我說、</p>
<p>「波現在懷着這管簫到市上也能度曲活命哩、很俏皮的波、知道我在諷刺他、頓時便扁着小嘴、以簫的程子輕輕的在我身上擊了一下、</p>
<p>漪、聽着我們嘲弄的聲音、挾着一本書怱怱地跑出來、手指乔着面皮羞我們、我們見面的時候、大家總是閙一陣才言歸於好的、獨有比我大一歲的漪、不大加入我們爭辯閧閙的漩渦、幽默像一個成人的神氣、</p>
<p>性情的優美、有時要比一個淑靜的女人超過的地方、没有事、便蒔着花卉、花的清香常爲晚風送來、供我們作夏夜清談的一種宜人的興奮劑、如若、夜間有月、是正當剛剛圓滿的月頭、坐在長長的靠椅上、望到她在月下愈美、愈幽靜、爲一種本能的壓抑、冒昧的、在那時忐忑如鹿跳的小心中、也曾親自誇讚她是一朶、素淡的百合花、其他還有許多美到不可以言語形容的、詩的聲音更爲爽朗、即其美之一、如同紫淡的月色中聽　遠遠叢林裏面起落有致的鈴鈴虫、站在那燈光透射的窗前、聽的人也能忘倦似的駐足不願離開、因爲、她的臥室的一隅臨着街、天氣太熱才新近遷到此地來、有一次、爲了這事寫了一張小條子給我、說是窗户的横本上貼了一個紅紙寫的小「福」字、就是她臥房的所在、到晚上發現那啓示的快樂、眞如官感上享着盛宴、我手中正揑着一束香氣撲鼻的鮮花、爲了琅琅的詩聲太好聽了、太愛人、手中的花朶畢竟擲了過去、</p>
<p>窗户裏面伸出一個逗人愛的姿首、借着淡淡的月光、辨别了是誰、才說了一聲、「咦、芷你進來、我看到這香花、就知道是你、」</p>
<p>我一面笑着進來、因爲她只歡喜這種花、香遠益清、似蓮花、但又比蓮花更雅艶、名目是有點模糊、不過、我家裏種植得很多、</p>
<p>「漪、我分贈了你的清香、你報答我什麽哩、」這話像不是孩子說的、在她、也　得撚弄衣角故故作害羞態、使我也低頭了、</p>
<p>掛在壁間的一支簫、這時像是爲我們解了圍、大家又恢復原有的狀態了、那夜波這孩子可没有來、如其那時知道所謂幽會的話、坐到很遲才走的兩個孩子、臉上愈加會緋紅如火哩、</p>
<p>第二年、問到漪的行蹤、波就以日本的姐姐代替她了、那時、還記得從日本得到她一封略長的信、</p>

<h3>Examination Review Committee Member Shao Yuan Chong and Others Take Office</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) After the National Government's memorial week, Shao Yuan Chong, Chairman of the Examination Review Committee, and members Zhang Wuhua, Mu Xiangyun, Guo Xinsong, Rao Yan, and Shi Shangkuan, as well as Vice Chairman of the Eligibility Selection Committee, Yun Yongbin, took their oaths of office. Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng performed the ceremony. Chairman Jiang presented the seal, and Chairman Shao received the seal. Chairman Shao led the oath-taking. Wang Chonghui, the supervisor of the oath-taking, delivered an address stating that although the examination system was inherent to China, it was previously subordinate to the executive branch. Now, with the five powers operating in parallel, all malpractices could be avoided, making it an institutional innovation. In the past, loyalty to the emperor was used to solidify one's position, and candidates only had thoughts of promotion and wealth. Now, we seek true talent for the nation and society, and candidates should use this opportunity to serve the nation and society as public servants. Next, Chairman Jiang delivered an address, hoping that they would follow the late Premier's teachings and government orders, and faithfully perform their duties. Next, Shao Yuan Chong and Wang Yongbin replied, stating that they would obey the instructions and fulfill their duties. After the ceremony, a photograph was taken and the meeting adjourned.

<h3>Representatives of the Shanxi Post-War Reconstruction Association Arrive in Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives of the Shanxi Post-War Reconstruction Association, such as Zhang Ce, have come to Beijing to petition the Central Government. The main points are: (1) The troops stationed in Shanxi Province should be reorganized according to the Central Government's organization, with divisions as the unit, and uniformly reorganized into national defense forces, stationed on the border to strengthen national defense. Before the reorganization, they must not recruit additional soldiers; (2) Implement the separation of military and civilian administration, and break the autocratic rule of officials; (3) Restore the 24 million yuan for reorganizing Shanxi's financial public bonds previously issued by the Central Government, maintain Shanxi currency, and bring the provincial bank under public ownership, supervised by people's organizations; (4) Convert the arsenal into a manufacturing enterprise, supervised by people's organizations, build the Datong-Pukou Railway, and reclaim the Zhengtai Railway; (5) Restore schools at all levels that were suspended due to military affairs, and resume classes. In addition, when Yan Xishan fled, he took over 11 million yuan from the provincial bank, except for a small portion given to Shang Zhen in Tianjin as operating expenses, the rest was taken away, causing Shanxi currency to be worth only 30 cents per yuan, and the provincial bank's current funds are only over 3 million, while the issuance of Shanxi currency has reached over 47 million, so the financial situation is in a desperate state. We earnestly hope that the Central Government will find a way to provide relief, and especially hope that the Central Government's handling of Shanxi affairs should comply with public opinion and not allow another replacement for Yan Xishan to manipulate everything.

<h3>Shanxi Army Reorganization and Dismissal Issues</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Shanxi army's reorganization and dismissal have been largely decided.

Establish a commander in Taiyuan, southern Shanxi, and northern Shanxi, each commanding two regiments; 2. Establish a commander in Shanxi and Suiyuan, each commanding three regiments; 3. Establish only one guard commander and deputy commander, with Zhang Huizhao's division being reorganized to fill the position. The above methods have not yet been decided, with most advocating for the second option. Rong Honglu will be appointed in Taiyuan, and Zhang Huizhao will be appointed in Suiyuan.

Zhao Chengshou's position has not yet been determined. The above methods are planned to be telegraphed to Zhang for instructions before a decision is made. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin Explains Doubts About the Factory Law</h3>

The speech was very long. First, he said that social evolution is due to the harmony of the interests of the majority of society, not due to the conflict of interests of the majority. This is the most brilliant and great discovery of the late Premier. Then, he described the process of drafting the Factory Law by the Legislative Yuan and the answers to several doubts about the Factory Law. He also said that the biggest reason for the underdevelopment of Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises is the unsound organization. Requesting a postponement is a manifestation of the national inertia. Legislation should not be shelved and used merely as decoration, but should truly bring the people under the rule of law, with the law being the common standard for everyone to abide by.

<h3>Disturbances at the Japanese Proletarian Women's Congress</h3>
<p>The struggle between the two parties in the Japanese parliament was reconciled and a mutual understanding was reached, but disturbances at the Proletarian Women's Congress followed one after another. It can be seen that in a country, once a violent act is discovered, those that follow must be more than one. First there is fighting, then assaults, then disturbances, then chaos, and finally bloodshed, or even the use of weapons to fight each other. The Chinese people, known throughout the world for their timidity and patience, have also followed this path, leading to internal war until now, when there is hope for an end. If other strong nations were involved, the degree of disturbance must have been more than this.</p>
<p>The ancients had a saying, "Like driving six horses with a rotten rope." This does not mean that those who govern the country are completely incapable and have this situation. It is because the relationships of the people are complicated and not one-way. They cannot be controlled by human power alone, and there are even more that are beyond human power. Mixed among them, therefore, no matter what method is used, the method is not broken, everything is orderly, and once the method is broken, there are thousands of holes, rising up together. Even the wise cannot plan, and even the strong cannot force a solution. If handled properly, the day of survival will be slightly longer; if not handled properly, the collapse and rupture will be seen immediately. This is the result of the evolution of worldly affairs and nothing can be done about it.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a nation or a country is prosperous and powerful, everyone considers everything to be natural and does not need to ask why. Once a gap arises and methods of coping must be used between each other, the period of decline is already near. Looking at the countries of the world today, how many countries are there that do not use coping methods internally?</p>
<p>Important Foreign Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Japanese Ruling and Opposition Parties Reach Understanding</h3>
<p>Result of Interior Minister Adachi's Visit to President Inukai</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shidehara States Words Misspoken</p>
<p>Government Will Not Make Separate Apology</p>
<p>▲Denpō News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th: Regarding a compromise plan about the issue of Prime Minister's Agent Shidehara's misspoken words, and the progress of the budget general meeting, according to last night's agreement, Interior Minister Adachi and Mochizuki, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, were scheduled to meet this morning. However, because Mochizuki was suffering from asthma</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>and could not speak, Interior Minister Adachi visited Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, at his private residence in Yotsuya Minamicho at 8:00 AM. Coincidentally, Akita Kiyoshi, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, was also present. The three sat down together and discussed the issue. Regarding the method of clarification of the misspoken words, Interior Minister Adachi proposed that the government use a clarifying statement to retract them and asked for understanding. Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, did not allow it and demanded that Shidehara retract the misspoken words straightforwardly. As a result of the negotiations, it was decided that Prime Minister's Agent Shidehara would declare, "My response the other day was a slip of the tongue and I now retract it." The understanding between the ruling and opposition parties was thus reached. The government will not use separate words of apology. Interior Minister Adachi left Inukai's residence at 9:25 AM and immediately went to report the course of events to the party executives and discuss it. Thus, this major dispute was resolved by the government's concession.</p>
<p>▲Denpō News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th: Because Mochizuki, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, had a fever since last night, Interior Minister Adachi went straight to visit Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, and a compromise was reached in a sudden turn of events. However, Inukai, the old president who is skilled at capturing and releasing in the political world, and Adachi, the only brain trust of the Minseitō, had a remarkable situation of intense competition when they met. At 9:00 AM, Interior Minister Adachi drove to Inukai's residence, and Akita Kiyoshi, Inukai's brain trust, had already arrived. They sat together in the upstairs reception room and started negotiating. Inukai took the initiative and actively put forward compromise conditions, saying that the parliament was in its current state, which was a cause for great regret. However, every problem must be explored to its source and exhausted to its roots. In addition to completely acknowledging that the answer to Nakajima's question was a slip of the tongue and completely retracting it, Shidehara must also add the phrase "the government is extremely fearful." Interior Minister Adachi also did not give an inch, saying that directly acknowledging the misspoken words and retracting the answer would eliminate the entire problem. This was the government's maximum concession point. Thus, a compromise was reached. The reason why the misspoken words issue, which had been continuously disturbing and unresolved since the 3rd, could take a sudden turn for the better was largely due to Interior Minister Adachi's personal efforts.</p>
<p>▲Denpō News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th: As a result of yesterday's discussions between Interior Minister Adachi and cabinet members and party executives, it was decided that the government and the party also acknowledged that Prime Minister's Agent Shidehara's response was a slip of the tongue and decided to retract it. In order to properly handle the difficult situation of the parliamentary standstill and break through, all negotiations were decided to be entrusted to Interior Minister Adachi. However, some members of the party, such as Nakano Seigō and Yamatō Jōichi, expressed dissatisfaction and reserved the right to acknowledge the misspoken words as the final concession point. When Interior Minister Adachi met with Mochizuki, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, last night, the Interior Minister proposed that the government should retract the inappropriate answer from the other day. Mochizuki consulted the Seiyukai executives, and the Seiyukai said that if the government did not directly acknowledge the misspoken words, it would oppose it to the end, and its attitude was still extremely tough. Therefore, the second meeting between Adachi and Mochizuki, which was scheduled to be held at 9:00 PM last night, was postponed to this morning. When Interior Minister Adachi received the notice refusing the second meeting last night, he summoned Jiangmu Tie, Morita, Nakano, Yamatō and other party executives to the Interior Minister's official residence to discuss the meeting this morning. As a result, it was decided that even if the government conceded to the final case of acknowledging the misspoken words, if the Seiyukai demanded an apology in addition to acknowledging the misspoken words, the government would resolutely refuse it and confront it to the end. Therefore, both war and peace strategies were prepared at that time. By the time of the meeting with President Inukai today, the Seiyukai had realized this situation and did not insist on demanding an apology. Therefore, it was able to take a sudden turn for the better and reach a point of resolution.</p>
<h3>Future Policy of the Seiyukai</h3>
<p>▲Denpō News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th: The Seiyukai held an executive meeting in the Diet at 12:10 PM to discuss the Inukai-Adachi compromise plan. Because those who held strong opinions occupied a greater influence, the opinions of the two factions could not be unified. At 1:30 PM, they took a break and Chief Secretary Mori went to meet with President Inukai to discuss follow-up measures. Other executives also ran around to unify the opinions of various groups within the party. It is heard that the Seiyukai's attitude from now on is that even if the compromise is reached, it will continue to investigate and attack the causing agent of the dispute, Shidehara. In other words, the acknowledgement of the Inukai-Adachi compromise is limited to retracting the misspoken words at the budget general meeting only. Everything else will be regarded as another issue. The government is paying close attention to the Seiyukai's investigation of responsibility and the reaction of the House of Peers. In addition to taking precautions, it will also mobilize all parties to understand.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Minseitō Executives</h3>
<p>▲Denpō News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th: The Minseitō executive meeting was held at 10:40 AM. First, Interior Minister Adachi reported the course of events of this morning's compromise with Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, and requested recognition or questioning, "Does the establishment of a compromise only retract the misspoken words, or is the withdrawal of accusations against Seiyukai violence members a condition of the compromise?" Interior Minister Adachi replied that the compromise only retracted the misspoken words and that the withdrawal of accusations was not a condition of the compromise. However, for the sake of smooth progress of the discussions, the mutual restoration of a samurai attitude should be considered. Therefore, the withdrawal of accusations also became a topic of discussion. It was explained that the Constitution was being implemented smoothly, so the withdrawal of accusations was requested for understanding. In the end, the executives recognized the matter as unavoidable, but the young members attacked the weak attitude of the executives and opposed the withdrawal. The executives are currently comforting them.</p>
<h3>Australian Financial Problems</h3>
<p>Chancellor's Three-Year Plan - Banking Association to Reject</p>
<p>Lam's Proposed Restructuring Plan - Premiers of Various States Reject It</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Canberra, 9th - The financial policy of the Australian central government's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Theodore, has not been approved by the premiers of Queensland or Western Australia. Unless the policy is modified, the Australian Banking Association will reject it. The premiers of Victoria and South Australia have not yet decided their stance on Theodore's policy. Theodore does not favor wage cuts but wants to restore the value of the Australian currency, control exchange rates, and reduce interest rates. Theodore has proposed a three-year plan, stating that if implemented, it could increase Australia's national income by 100 million pounds and create jobs for 200,000 people. At today's premiers' conference, the Premier of New South Wales, Lang, proposed a financial restructuring plan: (1) The Australian government should no longer pay interest to American creditors and should only do so when Britain deals with Australian war debts in the same way as it clears American debts. (2) The interest on all Australian government loans should be reduced to 3%. (3) The Australian government must immediately abolish its current gold standard and establish a new currency system based on Australia's financial strength. Lang declared that regardless of the decision of the premiers' conference, New South Wales has decided to implement this plan. If the whole country does this, the millions of pounds currently flowing abroad can circulate in Australia, resulting in lower Australian interest rates and a new life for industry, which can absorb the unemployed. Australia's reliance on the outside world would be reduced to a minimum, and trust within Australia could be restored. Lang's words shocked listeners, as they were tantamount to declaring a repudiation of foreign debt. Many were concerned that these words would affect Australia's credit abroad. Fortunately, the premiers of other states immediately rejected Lang's proposal. Australian Prime Minister Scullin declared that Australia would never endorse such a policy.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Madrid, 8th - The Spanish King's general election decree of March 1st was signed on Saturday and published in today's government gazette. At the same time, an order was issued to cancel previous orders restricting the people's exercise of constitutional rights and to restore all freedoms and rights granted by Article 10 of the constitution, so that all political parties can freely assemble and engage in legitimate election campaigns. In addition, 800 political prisoners involved in the failed revolution last winter have also been released. However, civil officials are still ordered to closely monitor all political gatherings, so it is difficult to say at this time how much actual freedom of speech the Spanish people will enjoy in the future. Also, the King of Spain has ordered the convening of a new parliament on March 25th.</p>
<h3>Turkish Authorities Extensively Search for Traitors</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Arrests Made</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Istanbul, 8th - Regarding the second interrogation in the Tahrir rebellion case at the Mini-Meng Special Court, Turkish authorities are now extensively searching the entire country, arresting anyone suspected of participating in conspiracies against the government. According to statistics, more than 1,000 people have been arrested, including hundreds in Istanbul, many of whom have been identified as communists. Therefore, outsiders believe that the Turkish government is taking the opportunity to purge the opposition party.</p>
<h3>US General Butler Cancels Court Martial</h3>
<p>Only a Reprimand Issued</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 8th - Regarding US General Butler's indiscreet remarks offending Italy, in addition to the Secretary of State apologizing to the Italian ambassador, the Navy Department has dispatched seven senior officers to form a court-martial to try him. However, the Secretary of the Navy now claims that, in consideration of General Butler's distinguished service, the court-martial has been canceled, and only a reprimand has been issued.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 8th - Rear Admiral Butler, who previously offended Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in a speech in Philadelphia, had been formally apologized to by Secretary of State Stimson to the Italian Prime Minister and the Italian people, and a court-martial was scheduled to open at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on the 16th of this month to try Butler. Today, Secretary of the Navy Adams suddenly announced the cancellation of the hearing. The news caused a nationwide shock, and the reason has not yet been announced by the authorities.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Phoenix, 8th - Young journalist Vanderbeek, who was involved in Rear Admiral Butler's case of offending Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stated today that he was extremely gratified to hear that Secretary Adams had canceled the hearing for Butler. It is reported that Secretary Adams issued the order to cancel the hearing after Butler admitted his indiscretion and expressed his apologies. Today, Secretary Adams also stated that he hoped that no further punishment would be imposed on Butler. From this perspective, an extremely peculiar page in American diplomatic history can now be said to have come to an end.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Legal Rights Negotiations</h3>
<p>US Experts Promise to Exert Their Efforts</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 8th - According to observations, the United States will soon send a final note to the Chinese National Government regarding China's proposal to abolish the consular jurisdiction enjoyed by American citizens in China. Dr. Wu Chaoshu, the Chinese ambassador to Washington, has held several talks with experts on the Far East at the US State Department. According to Ambassador Wu, the experts have promised to exert their efforts to ensure that the State Department responds to the Chinese government's refutation of the previous American reply as soon as possible. The Associated Press has learned that the State Department officials who met with Ambassador Wu have indicated that they are giving careful and sympathetic consideration to China's proposal. However, because the matter involves Britain, the progress of the negotiations has been slow. The content of the US government's reply has not yet been disclosed by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquakes Continue on New Zealand's North Island</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Wellington, 9th - Severe earthquakes continue to be felt on the North Island and Hawke's Bay, with intensity similar to that experienced by Napier and Hastings on Tuesday. The town of Wairoa in Hawke's Bay and Napier were both shaken, but the damage in Napier was limited to houses that had already been damaged and have now collapsed. The town of Wairoa has a population of 2,000, and no reports of damage have been received yet.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Wellington, 8th - The death toll from the Napier earthquake is now 103. According to official estimates, 120-130 people died in Hastings, bringing the total death toll to over 200.</p>
<h3>British Independent Labour Party Meets to Consider Leaving the Labour Party</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 9th - The Independent Labour Party in London and other places held meetings to consider the issue of breaking away from the Labour Party. After two days of discussion, it was decided to discuss it again at the Independent Labour Party's annual meeting. Sir Oswald Mosley's declaration last December, aimed at relieving unemployment, advocating the organization of a five-person cabinet to handle national affairs, reorganize existing enterprises, develop new industries, establish a food and manufactured goods import administration, conclude commercial contracts with overseas autonomous regions, and create public utility agencies to build houses, etc., was also discussed. Today, the majority of the meeting rejected the motion to support the above proposals and passed a resolution advocating international organizational policies, not granting preferential treatment to overseas autonomous regions, and treating all countries equally.</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim Leader Expresses Important Views</h3>
<p>Opposes Jewish Immigration to Palestine</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th - Prominent Indian Muslim leader Shaukat Ali today spoke to the Muslim-Christian Association in Jaffa, opposing Jewish immigration to Palestine, saying that Jewish immigration and political demands are detrimental to Palestine. Jews must change their policies, and the world's Muslims will support the Muslim-Christian Association. It is proposed to make Jerusalem the cultural center of the Muslim world during the Muslim holidays. The connection between Muslims and Christians this time is worthy of praise. Shaukat Ali was an important leader of the Muslim movement in 1919-1920 and a key figure in India's non-cooperation movement against Britain.</p>
<h3>British Admiralty to Send Warship to Madeira Island</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 9th - This morning, the Daily Express learned that the British Navy had hinted to the commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet, currently conducting exercises in Gibraltar, that it might be necessary to send a warship to Madeira Island. However, to date, there has been no need to send a warship there.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Gibraltar, 8th - The warship Malaya was hastily ordered to sail to Madeira Island, west of Morocco. The rumor that it was to defend against riots is obviously not true. The warship sailed out this morning but returned shortly thereafter. It is also rumored that several destroyers that had gone to Madeira are still docked in the harbor.</p>
<h3>British to Send Personnel to China to Investigate Silver Coin Issues</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Johannesburg, 9th - It is reported that Clegg, the former governor of the South African Reserve Bank, will soon depart for Shanghai, having been hired by the British government to investigate silver coin issues in China. (Reuters note: The British Consulate in Shanghai has not received any news of Clegg being invited to China to investigate, but the above news from South Africa cannot be considered inaccurate, as the British government may want to obtain an independent observation on silver coin issues, as Clegg can provide, for reference in its own policies. Clegg was previously an employee of the Bank of England.)</p>
<h3>Polish Authorities Deny Restricting Entry of Workers</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Warsaw, 9th - Polish authorities deny reports that the Polish government will follow other countries in restricting the entry of foreign workers. The number of Polish workers seeking a living abroad far exceeds the number of foreign workers coming to Poland. Implementing this measure would only harm oneself.</p>
<h3>Gold Vein Discovered in California</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Placerville, California, 9th - It is widely rumored today that two people named So-and-so have discovered a gold vein here, near the old gold mine discovered in 1849. According to this gold mine, it was believed to have been exhausted many years ago. It is not yet known whether the newly discovered gold vein is rich. At a time when the tide of unemployment is rampant throughout the country, the unemployed will certainly flock to it upon hearing the news.</p>
<h3>Japanese Proletarian Women's Convention</h3>
<p>Police Stop Speech, Leading to Great Confusion</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - The Proletarian Women's League and the Social Masses Women's League held a proletarian women's convention at the Kyodo Kaikan yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Each speaker took the stage under guard and shouted, "Oppose the unequal women's suffrage bill!" "Equal suffrage rights must be given to men and women over the age of 18!" Subsequently, the police ordered them to stop speaking, leading to great confusion, and some were arrested. Seven representatives, including Ms. Sakai Magara, who were angered by the police's actions, visited Interior Minister Adachi at his official residence at 6:00 PM last night and presented a resolution questioning his actions.</p>

<h3>Memorial Week for Central Authorities and National Government</h3>
<p>▲ Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Zhu Peide, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Jiwen, Yu Jingtang, Liu Luyin, Wang Zhengting, Niu Yongjian, and approximately 500 staff members attended. Zhu Peide chaired the meeting, and the ceremony was conducted as usual. Wang Zhengting delivered a report, stating that humans have had groups since the beginning, and groups have different sizes but the same nature, ranging in area from tens of square miles to hundreds of square miles and in population from thousands to tens of millions. Since there are groups, there must be interactions, which is diplomacy. Diplomatic policies vary. In the past, conflicts between groups led to so-called vertical and horizontal strategies, which are now called curved-line diplomacy. The purpose is to seek one's own national interests by deceiving and harming other countries. Austrian Foreign Minister Metternich, who served for more than 40 years in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, can be said to be the representative of curved-line diplomacy, with no fixed policy, only wanting to benefit oneself and harm others. Modern diplomacy is two-faced, half white and half black, or double-layered diplomacy, where one layer conflicts with what its diplomats say. The National Government, based on Sun Yat-sen's teachings, practices straight-line diplomacy, which is also justice diplomacy. Sun Yat-sen's will is to unite with the world's nations that treat us as equals and fight together, that is, to befriend countries that treat us as equals and to oppose countries that do not treat us as equals. Sun Yat-sen also said that he recently advocated the abolition of unequal treaties. The so-called abolition of unequal treaties is beneficial to us and does no harm to others. Tariff autonomy has already been achieved and does not need to be discussed. The most painful thing is that extraterritoriality has not been abolished. We are determined to strive for its abolition. Recently, one or two countries have used deadlines as a threat. We dare to solemnly declare that the abolition of extraterritoriality is our greatest determination. With extraterritoriality in place, foreigners do not have to pay taxes. What obligations do foreigners in China fulfill? Foreign-run banks and mines do not pay taxes. With these special benefits, economic oppression still exists in part. Therefore, the National Government has made a great determination to resolve this matter this year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on Sun Yat-sen's teachings, bases everything on justice. In the future, the world will be able to submit to justice and tend towards a world of great unity. Then, China's national foundation will be stable, and it can enjoy peace and happiness. Today, I would like to present this diplomatic policy to all comrades.</p>
<p>▲ National Government: On the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Zhang Ji, Zhu Peide, Niu Yongjian, Wang Chonghui, Song Ziwen, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaoyaozu, and more than 300 staff members and guests attended. Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting and led the ceremony as usual. Zhang Ji gave a speech on rural issues, stating that China is an agricultural country, and agriculture is the foundation of the people's livelihood. The Three Principles of the People were created based on this foundation</p>

<h3>Continued Important News</h3>
<p>and China's national conditions. Therefore, rural issues are extremely important. Some say that China should adapt to the world trend and become industrialized, but this should be carefully considered and studied separately. Since the industrial revolution in the 18th century, European and American industrial countries have become increasingly dangerous. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People were created with a long-term vision, standing on the foundation of mankind's permanent life. Therefore, those who advocate industrialization do not understand the principles of historical evolution. After World War I, industrial countries are on the verge of bankruptcy, but China is still good. If we can work hard from now on, we can not only save ourselves but also save the world. Therefore, China should prioritize agriculture and treat industry as a guest, as the foundation of the country, and should not industrialize. Chinese politics only exist in cities and rarely reach the countryside. The countryside relies entirely on the old ethics to maintain order. If the old ethical concepts are abolished and replaced with the power of political police, it will definitely be ineffective. Rural people should defend themselves, such as the villages in Cangzhou, Hebei, which are very peaceful and can be said to be open at night, which is a perfect expression of self-defense. If we only pay attention to sending troops to suppress bandits and do not pay attention to the people's self-defense, it is a big mistake. Also, if the county magistrates are not corrupt, there will be no local tyrants and evil gentry. The county magistrates should often go to the countryside to show that they are serving the people, and the people will be peaceful. Also, such as national education, I saw in Japan that even in remote villages, there must be a well-equipped primary school. They can pay attention to basic issues, so they can be strong. Now, our country uses huge sums of money to run universities, creating many students who specialize in making trouble and raising many professors who only teach in name and are always absent. It is not worth it. All comrades should pay attention to the above points. After Zhang's speech, the ceremony ended, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Troops Postpone Departure to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Incomplete Departure Procedures</p>
<p>▲ Liu Yufen and Cao Haosen Still in Jining</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the issue of Sun Lianzhong's troops of the 26th Route Army departing for Jiangxi to suppress the communists, news received in Jinan in the past day or two has stated that Sun's army began to depart in batches from Jining on the evening of the 5th. However, as of today (the 7th), telegrams from Yanzhou and Xuzhou both stated that Sun's army trains have not yet passed through the area. Furthermore, a telegram received from Jining stated that Sun Lianzhong's army has not been able to complete the departure procedures, so they have not yet moved by noon on the 7th. Liu Yufen, the former chairman of Gansu, and Cao Haosen, the director of the Army Department, who were sent by the central government, are still in Jining, negotiating on the departure of Sun's army. The previous announcement in Jinan that Sun's army had departed was not true. However, the departure of Sun's army is only a matter of time and should be able to mobilize in about two or three days.

<h3>Shaanxi Urges Issuance of Shaanxi Disaster Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: Representatives of disaster victims from various counties in Shaanxi Province plan to expand their petition for the 8 million Shaanxi disaster relief bonds. They held a meeting at the Shandong Guild Hall on January 31, attended by more than 80 disaster victim representatives from various counties. Wu Xiaochuan chaired the meeting and reported on the reasons for the meeting, stating that the Shaanxi disaster is severe, and relief is urgently needed. Fortunately, the Fourth Plenary Session decided to issue 8 million yuan in Shaanxi disaster relief bonds, but for several months, these bonds have not been issued. Shaanxi has suffered from repeated disasters for years, with a large number of hungry people and starvation everywhere. Now, in the depths of winter, they are suffering from hunger and cold. At this critical moment of life and death, if the central government delays the previously promised 8 million bonds, the people of Shaanxi will be left with no survivors. Since we are representatives of the disaster victims, we should work hard to plead for the 8 million bonds to be sent to Shaanxi as soon as possible. Now, please discuss the solutions together. The following resolutions were then discussed: (1) Organize a joint association of disaster victim representatives from various counties in Shaanxi. (2) Request the Shaanxi Relief Committee, the provincial government, the provincial party headquarters, the heads of various agencies, and various charitable organizations to work together to urge the issuance of the 8 million disaster relief bonds. (3) Send telegrams to the central government, various provincial governments, newspapers, charitable organizations, celebrities, and philanthropists to urge the issuance of the 8 million disaster relief bonds. Wang Binqing was immediately appointed to draft the telegram, and Cao Daofu, Wu Xiaochuan, Yuan Shuming, Lu Yizhai, Xu Zhaonan, and Jing Renqian were appointed to review it. As soon as the review is completed, it will be sent to all parties. (February 1st)</p>
<h3>Salt Merchants of Lu Gang Petition for Release of Four General Managers</h3>
<p>▲ All Salt Merchants Willing to Guarantee with Their Lives and Property</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Wang Yibao, Guo Shaolan, Li Zanchen, Li Shaofang, and Yang Danchen, the five general managers of Changlu, have been under arrest and sent to Beijing for the past two years, and the case has not been concluded. After Wang Yibao died in the capital, the families of the remaining four general managers are increasingly fearful. Although the current Salt Transport Commissioner, Hong Weiguo, has sent telegrams to Beijing to intercede on their behalf, there has been no reply. The current general managers, Liu Jiankui and others, and more than 80 salt merchants, jointly signed a petition, which was taken to the Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office yesterday (the 3rd) at 4:00 PM to petition, stating that all salt merchants are willing to guarantee with their lives and property, requesting Commissioner Hong to guarantee to the authorities in Beijing and request permission for the four general managers held in Beijing to return to Tianjin first for medical treatment and to be summoned without delay. The main idea of the petition was that since Wang, the general manager, died in Beijing, the general managers who remain in Beijing have been deeply affected. The old illnesses have not healed and have worsened. They have previously requested that the committee quickly approve the case so that they can be released as soon as possible to preserve their lives. Recently, they received letters from the four general managers in Beijing stating that since Wang, the general manager, returned to Tianjin for burial, they have been heartbroken and unable to sleep or eat. In addition, the annual closing is approaching. They have repeatedly received letters from their families, stating that creditors are demanding repayment day and night because they have not been repaid for a long time. The family members are not the persons in charge and are unable to cope. They have repeatedly urged them to return to Tianjin quickly to settle everything to maintain the livelihood of the whole family. After reading the letters, they were bewildered in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, and day after day, their worries and illnesses increased. The future is uncertain, and they feel that life is worse than death. They can only request that all salt merchants provide a reliable guarantee and publicly request the Commissioner to forward the request to the committee to allow them to return to Tianjin for medical treatment and to facilitate the settlement of debts. If they are granted permission, they will be grateful beyond measure. After the salt merchants read the letters, they were all in tears, worried, and distraught. Thinking about the four general managers, who are all old and sad, anyone with a heart would be depressed and sick, which is common and natural. Moreover, their families have been impoverished for a long time, and there is no good way to make a living. Debts have already been built up, and there is no end to the demands for repayment. If they want to settle the debts, there is no one in charge. If they want to return home, the case has not been concluded. If they are guilty, the four general managers would not dare to seek anything. However, if we put ourselves in their shoes, who can bear this injustice? If something unexpected happens, there would be no way to redeem the sorrow. If they are temporarily allowed to return alive, it would also be in line with the Three Principles of the People. Waiting for the case in Beijing is just an extrajudicial detention. Taking bail to return to Tianjin would still be fully responsible. Although Beijing and Tianjin are 2,600 miles apart, the train only takes 36 hours. If they need to be interrogated after returning to Tianjin, they can be in court in one or two days. What is the difference between accepting the verdict in the two places? It is appropriate to issue a guarantee from all salt merchants, publicly requesting the Committee to forward the request to the investigation committee to allow the four general managers to return to Tianjin for medical treatment. If they are summoned, they will go to Beijing immediately. If there is any mistake, all salt merchants are willing to guarantee with their lives and property. We humbly submit the complete truth, hoping that you will examine and implement it. (4th)</p>
<h3>Hunan Holds Public Funeral for Lin Zhiyu</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After Lin Zhiyu, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, died of illness in Nanchang, the central government posthumously awarded him the rank of general. Lin was from Wuling (i.e., Changde), Hunan, and served as the first popularly elected governor of Hunan and speaker of the provincial assembly during the provincial constitutional era. He was the commander-in-chief of the First Army of the Hunan Army of the National Construction Allied Forces and was one of Hunan's prominent figures. After his death, Lu Diping, He Yaobu, Tan Daoyuan, Xu Kexiang, Li Yunjie, and other important figures sent telegrams to Hunan, requesting that a provincial funeral be held and that he be buried on Yuelu Mountain, alongside Huang Xing, Cai E, Jiao Dafeng, and Chen Tianhua, to show respect. He Jian submitted the case to the provincial government committee, which discussed it repeatedly and decided that there was no basis for a provincial funeral and that Yuelu Mountain had already decided not to add any more burials to preserve the scenic spot. Therefore, it was decided that the provincial treasury would issue 3,000 yuan to find another location and hold a public funeral, appointing Dai Xuecen as the director and Chen Nanyang as the deputy director, and setting up a public funeral office in the fire brigade in Yuqiao Street to prepare. Lin's coffin was transported from Jiujiang to Hankou on January 20 and from Wuchang to Hunan on the 23rd. On the afternoon of the 24th, it arrived in Changsha. On the morning of the 25th, all parties in the provincial capital, including the party, government, military, and educational circles, and various groups, gathered at the station to welcome the coffin, with approximately 7,000-8,000 people, more lively than ever before. After the coffin arrived in the province, the preparatory staff and the bereaved family discussed and found a burial site on the mountain slope outside the Xiaowumen Intersection. It was decided to hold a memorial service for three days, from February 5th to 7th. The first day was for all parties in the party, government, military, education, and news circles, the second day was for various groups, municipal groups, and the Xiangxi Association, and the third day was for relatives and the bereaved family. The funeral was held on the morning of February 8th, and the public burial was held in the afternoon. However, due to insufficient funds, a request was submitted to the provincial government for an additional 2,000 yuan, bringing the total to 5,000 yuan. In addition, the Jiangxi Provincial Government also allocated 5,000 yuan, so Lin's funeral expenses totaled 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, the 5th, was the first day of the memorial service. All parties in the party, government, military, education, and news circles went to pay their respects in an endless stream. The arrangement of the filial hall was extremely beautiful. The elegies sent by various parties numbered no less than 7,000-8,000, which were dazzling. Chairman Chiang's elegy read, "High spirit accompanies Yi and Hui, great integrity shines on Hunan." He Chenjun's elegy read, "Meritorious career counts a lifetime, discussing style and friendship, inclined heart, towering, should continue the rise of Chaling, meeting words in a room, Zheng Xiong talked freely, alas, suddenly surprised Liaohe to return." He Jian's elegy read, "On the political figures of Hunan Province, Wuling can continue the business of Chaling, for the sake of Jiangxi's peace, the past events are unforgettable, and the future teachers are from the past." At about 10:00 AM, He Jian led all members of the provincial government and the secretary-general, the president of the High Court, etc., to the scene to pay their respects, and the ceremony was extremely solemn. (February 6th)</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Sets Deadline for Eradicating Tobacco Seedlings</h3>
<p>▲ Four Months Deadline, Extensions Possible</p>
<p>▲ Liu Ce Appointed as Commissioner, Tobacco Prohibition Offices Established</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the implementation of special taxes on Hunan and Hubei, tobacco prohibition in Hunan has not been as strict as before. In the counties bordering Guizhou in western Hunan, and in the Yongshun, Baojing, Longshan, and Sangzhi areas, tobacco seedlings are widely planted. The annual revenue from tobacco seedling taxes amounts to several million yuan, mostly pocketed by local garrison officers and militia personnel. The provincial government, due to its reach being limited and constant disturbances, has not had time to intervene. Now, He Jian has specially appointed Liu Ce as the Hunan Provincial Commissioner for Tobacco Prohibition, responsible for investigating and eradicating tobacco seedlings throughout the province. Tobacco prohibition offices will be established within the county governments of tobacco-growing counties, with personnel appointed to handle matters jointly with the county magistrates. Starting from February of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), a four-month deadline has been set for completion, but extensions may be granted if necessary. Liu Ce is scheduled to officially take office on February 10th to plan and proceed. This commissioner is responsible for special duties and is thus directly under the provincial government, not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Civil Affairs. Furthermore, the provincial government has formulated and promulgated a "Provisional Statute for the Hunan Provincial Commissioner for Tobacco Prohibition," consisting of twenty-five articles. Some observers believe that, based on the provisions of Article 11, the emphasis seems to be on collecting fines to alleviate financial difficulties. The statute is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Hunan Provincial Government, for the strict enforcement of tobacco prohibition, has specially established a Tobacco Prohibition Commissioner.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Commissioner for Investigating and Eradicating Tobacco Seedlings is directly under the Hunan Provincial Government.</p>

Those who conceal information shall be filled in by the inspectors with the verification from the local militia. After the inspection and registration of each zone are completed, the local militia shall affix their seals as proof and submit the records to the office for file. If the acreage determined by the inspectors is clearly unfair, the tobacco-growing households shall be allowed to request a review by the local militia or appeal to the county tobacco prohibition office for investigation.</p>

<p>Article 15: When collecting fines, the accounting officer shall issue receipts for the fines in accordance with the amounts. The fine receipts shall be issued by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Article 16: County tobacco prohibition committee members and county magistrates who are found to be colluding in fraudulent activities shall be reported separately for dismissal and punishment.

<p>Article 24: If there are any matters not covered by this statute, they may be submitted for approval and amendment.</p>
<p>Article 25: This statute shall be implemented upon approval by the provincial government committee. (February 6th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Sets Date for Commencement of Business Tax Collection</h3>
<p>▲ Uniform Collection Province-Wide from March 1st</p>
<p>The Finance Department of Zhejiang Province has been actively preparing for the business tax collection in recent days. Originally, the various local branch bureaus were scheduled to be established by mid-month to implement the tax. However, as this is a novel undertaking, caution is necessary. Therefore, the Finance Department has determined that the business tax will be uniformly collected province-wide starting from March 1st, and has instructed the bureau chiefs and tax supervisors to comply. As for the expenses of each bureau, the Finance Department has proposed 1,000 yuan per bureau per month. The bureau chiefs held a second meeting the other day, noting that the procedures for business tax collection are quite complex, requiring at least 50 personnel per bureau. At 30 yuan per person per month, this would amount to 1,500 yuan. The allocated funds from the department are insufficient to maintain integrity.

<h3>Total Number of Chaozhou and Meizhou People Migrating to Southeast Asia in the 19th Year of the Republic (1930)</h3>
<p>▲ 115,791 People Going South</p>
<p>▲ 93,767 People Returning</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Southeast Asia has long been the outlet for surplus population from our country. Taking Chaozhou and Meizhou as examples, the current economic stagnation and high unemployment rates mean that the surplus population must go south to wage a war for survival. However, since the Japanese implemented their southward advance policy, the Chinese farmers, laborers, and merchants in Siam have been greatly affected. Furthermore, due to the import restrictions imposed by the British and Dutch governments, the southward migration of our overseas Chinese has largely come to a standstill. According to the survey conducted by the Overseas Chinese Reception Center the year before last, the number of overseas Chinese going south far exceeded those returning. Since June of last year, except for Siam, where the number of overseas Chinese going there remains high, the numbers going to Singapore and Annam have declined significantly. Moreover, due to the official promulgation of the order by the Singapore government restricting the entry of Chinese laborers and the doubling of travel expenses, the proportion of overseas Chinese traveling to and from the two ports is now the opposite of what it used to be. The following is a comparison of the number of overseas Chinese traveling to and from Siam, Thailand, and Vietnam, as surveyed by the Overseas Chinese Reception Center last year and the year before last, broken down by month:</p>
<p>▲ Going South: January: 4,260 people, February: 10,739 people, March: 23,594 people, April: 15,694 people, May: 13,749 people, June: 9,939 people, July: 9,471 people, August: 8,751 people, September: 6,608 people, October: 7,714 people, November: 7,804 people, December: 7,472 people, Total: 115,791 people.</p>
<p>▲ Returning: January: 5,524 people, February: 4,307 people, March: 7,105 people, April: 7,714 people, May: 11,399 people, June: 9,519 people, July: 7,791 people, August: 1,098 people, September: 7,432 people, October: 8,917 people, November: 6,389 people, December: 8,412 people, Total: 93,767 people.</p>

<h3>Qingdao Cracks Down on Japanese Nationals Illegally Manufacturing Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>▲ The Main Culprit is Eunosuke Taita</p>
<p>▲ Has Been Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate for Interrogation</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Japanese vagrants residing in Qingdao have long relied on consular jurisdiction as a shield, committing all sorts of illegal and criminal acts without restraint. Whenever our Chinese authorities apprehend someone selling heroin, narcotics, firearms, or other offenses, once they are sent to the Japanese consulate, they are briefly interrogated and then released without any punishment. Consequently, Japanese vagrants have become increasingly emboldened and committed more and more crimes. Recently, a case of Japanese nationals illegally manufacturing counterfeit currency was cracked down upon. Recently, counterfeit 10-yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications were discovered in the Qingdao market. The Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the detective team to conduct a secret investigation. On February 1st, Detective Hu Huating, based on information from an informant, found that Sun Rubin, located at 27 Yuansheng Lane, Xiaolicun Road, was the person who introduced the purchase of these counterfeit banknotes. He immediately went to Sun's residence, who said that the sale had to go through a Mr. Yin, who worked as a domestic helper for a Japanese family, and that cash had to be paid in advance before delivery could be made. Hao Shudong, a tea server at the Bank of Communications, handed over 180 silver dollars to purchase 1,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes. Sun accepted the money, went into the courtyard, and immediately handed over two bundles of counterfeit banknotes. Seeing that there was evidence, the detectives first lured Sun away to another location, and then, together with officers from the Second Precinct, arrested Yin Songshan in Yuansheng Lane, Licun Road. 99 silver dollars and a business card of Eunosuke Taita (a Japanese national residing at 29 Zhangyin Road) were found on his person. In his residence, 40 counterfeit Bank of Communications 10-yuan banknotes were found. Sun and Yin were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Sun confessed that he was selling the counterfeit banknotes on behalf of Yin Songshan, earning a commission of 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Yin confessed that the counterfeit banknotes were entrusted to him for sale by Eunosuke Taita, a friend of Inoue, a Japanese national residing on Tieshan Road (the Japanese national lives at 29 Zhangyin Road), with a profit of 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Based on the confession, the bureau informed the Japanese consulate and went to Inoue's residence on Tieshan Road for a search. However, the Japanese national had already fled upon hearing the news. They then went to 29 Zhangyin Road to inquire about Eunosuke Taita. The resident there, Shin Kenshiron, a Japanese national, stated that Eunosuke Taita was no longer there. On the 4th, Eunosuke Taita was apprehended at that location. He was immediately handed over to the Japanese police to be taken to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. It is also reported that the Public Security Bureau has reported the details of the case to the municipal government and requested that a strong protest be lodged with the Japanese consulate, demanding that the suspect be severely punished and not be released lightly.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Reduces and Merges Salt Affairs Branches</h3>
<p>▲ Effective from February 1st</p>
<p>Beijing News: In addition to the field offices directly managing salt fields in various salt affairs administrative agencies, the transportation, sales, inspection, and verification affairs are becoming increasingly complex. Consequently, the number of established agencies has also increased. However, due to long-standing traditions, the situation is different now than in the past. Based on the principle of vigorously reducing administration and merging agencies, the Ministry of Finance has re-examined the branch agencies under the jurisdiction of various transportation commissioners, deputy commissioners, and revenue bureaus and has reduced and merged them separately. It is now learned that the Haidao Bridge and Sunjiazhuang inspection posts in Huainan, the Nan Salt Office's anti-smuggling post, the Bengbu verification officer, the Gaochun shore supervision bureau, the Lishui branch bureau, the stationed Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi verification commissioners, the Jinan field transportation supervision commissioner, the Tongzhou urging payment of land price commissioner, and the stationed Hubei verification western shipping commissioner have all been abolished. All original transportation and sales bureaus set up along the shore have been abolished and replaced with two agencies: the Outer River Shore Supervision Bureau and the Inner River Shore Supervision Bureau. The original Taiba monitoring officer and the Taixian South Gate verification post have been abolished. All salt verification affairs in the Tongtai area will be handled by the Inner River Supervision Bureau. In northern Jiangsu, the Wuhe and Linhuai inspection bureaus have been abolished. In Anhui, the stationed Wuhu office and the Tongzhou verification bureau have been abolished. In Liangzhe, the Tonglu inspection office has been abolished.

<p>Wang Jiaomei and her mother, who were kidnapped for the second time by bandits in Xiyang Town, Fushan District of this county, have been missing for two months. They were suddenly released on the 6th, much to the joy of their relatives. It is learned that Wang Jiaomei is of marriageable age, petite, and quite attractive. On the night of the kidnapping, she was with her mother, but later the bandits separated them. It is unknown where the mother was taken. Jiaomei was held at the residence of a small leader named Tai. Seeing her attractive appearance, Qin intended to offer her to the bandit chief as a mistress, hoping to gain merit. He sent her the next day, but the bandit chief not only refused but also flew into a rage, suspecting Qin of concealing the hostage without reporting it and wanting to kill him. Tai was also greatly angered, and a firefight ensued. As a result, Qin was killed by the bandit chief, and Jiaomei was placed in the ship's hold, not allowed to see the light of day. The other day, the Nantong Water Police Corps launched a major crackdown on the bandits and rescued the boat. Upon inspecting the boat, Wang Jiaomei was found hiding in the hold, afraid to come out, as she had heard intense gunfire. When she saw that the people boarding the boat were soldiers in uniform, she told them what had happened and her address. After returning to the county, her family was notified and went to retrieve her.</p>

<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Salt Merchants Request Cancellation of the Gan Province Zhejiang Salt Port Tax Bureau</p>
<p>Shaoxing salt merchants transport approximately 200,000 dan of salt to Changshan and Yushan in Jiangxi each year. The Jiangxi Provincial Government established the Zhejiang Salt Port Tax Bureau in Guangxin, charging a tax of two yuan and one jiao per dan of salt imported, accounting for two-thirds of the regular tax. As a result, sales have gradually declined to 170,000 dan, causing significant losses to both the national tax revenue and the merchants. After the National Government ordered the abolition of all inland taxes across the country, all tax bureaus have been abolished, but the Zhejiang Salt Port Tax Bureau in Gan still exists and continues to collect taxes, in violation of the central government's order to abolish inland taxes. Yesterday, the Standing Guang Kai Gang Merchants Executive Committee petitioned the Zhejiang Transport Envoy to forward a request to the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Jiangxi Provincial Government to abolish the tax bureau as soon as possible to eliminate abuses of power.</p>

<h3>Correspondence from Tongji Daruosheng in Shanghai and Harbin</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>Tongji and Daruosheng have both been operating for many years and have made considerable profits. Although the Harbin market was sluggish last year due to the high price of gold and low price of silver and the global economic recession, it was not as prosperous as in the past. However, the impact on the two stores was not significant, and the business was still profitable. There was definitely no loss of capital. Your newspaper published a special dispatch from Harbin on January 25, claiming that 400,000 taels of capital had been lost. On January 29, a correspondence from Harbin claimed that losses were between 1.8 million and 2 million taels in less than a year, which was not enough to cover all the losses. This news is completely inconsistent with the facts. The fact that the two stores convened a creditors' meeting at the Municipal Preparatory Office was a long-standing practice. At the end of each year, the stores reported on their business situation and discussed business strategies to creditor banks. It was not as reported in the newspaper that the stores were losing money and requesting bankruptcy. Currently, the price of gold fluctuates up and down, and the global economic situation shows no sign of recovery. Business operators, regardless of their current business situation, must take appropriate measures to prevent further deterioration of the economic situation. This is why the two stores intend to reduce their scope and temporarily seek conservatism. However, all parties in Harbin believe that the two stores are important to the Harbin market, and if they were to shrink, it would have a significant impact on the market. Therefore, they urged the two stores to continue operating on the current scale. The creditor banks also voluntarily deferred the collection of interest for one year to help the development of the two stores and prevent Harbin from becoming more desolate. Your newspaper's reporters did not fully understand this situation. We are providing this clarification to inform you of the truth. We respectfully request that you publish this letter and wish you good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Tongji Daruosheng, Harbin, Shanghai Office, February 7.</p>

<h3>Important News: Ministry of Education Explains the Level of Chongzheng School in Mongol Banners</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that the level of Chongzheng School in the Inner Mongolia Zhuomeng Khalkha Right Banner should be equivalent to that of a middle school. It consulted the Ministry of Civil Service to ask whether the Chongzheng School in the Inner Mongolia Zhuosotu League Khalkha Right Banner had been approved by the Ministry or the former Ministry of Education, and whether the normal class had a specialized level. The ministry ordered the Zhasake of the banner to investigate and report back. According to the report, Chongzheng School was founded in September of the 30th year of Guangxu during the Qing Dynasty. In the 31st year of Guangxu, the Minister of Education requested a reward, and the school was rewarded by imperial edict. In February of the 32nd year of Guangxu, a junior normal class was added. The graduation level after three years was equivalent to that of a middle school. Although Chongzheng School has not been formally registered with the Ministry or the former Ministry of Education, it seems appropriate to make a special accommodation to the school, given its remote location and the desire to encourage education in the Mongol banners, and allow it to be treated as a registered school.</p>

The Propaganda Group appointed Shu Yuzhen, Lin Kecong, and Ouyang Yawen three days ago to promote the use of national goods in the city's girls' schools. It is heard that Ms. Kecong gave a lecture at the Patriotic Girls' School yesterday morning. Although there was heavy rain, more than 300 people came to the school to listen to the lecture. In addition, Ms. Lin's eloquence was clever and her speech was sincere. Everyone who listened was moved, and for a time, they signed their names and volunteered to join the association. It is said that 98% of the entire school reached the target, which can be said to be an unprecedented record in the sound of promoting national goods.</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of Yu Jianhua's Second Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>The famous calligrapher and painter Yu Jianhua is known for his calligraphy and painting skills and is respected by the art world. In November of last year, he held a solo exhibition with 100 pieces of work. All of them were pre-ordered before the exhibition, and more than 170 pieces were pre-ordered during the exhibition. Now Mr. Yu has made 120 pieces of the pre-ordered works, and on February 7th and 8th, he held a second solo exhibition at the Ningbo Township Association. The exhibits were more exquisite than the first time, and each painting was re-set to dozens of pieces. Each painting has changes and there is no stagnant disadvantage. The management of the chapters is extremely painstaking, so the visitors are very enthusiastic. Famous artists such as Xiao Wuquan, Wei Ruosou, Wu Zhongxiong, Zhang Shanzi, Xiong Songquan, Ma Mengrong, Qian Shoutie, Cai Yimin, and Chen Gangshu all came to the meeting to visit and praised it non-stop. The great collector Di Chuqing also came to the meeting to set the fishing boat to catch the clouds and mountains. There were also many Japanese visitors, and more than 20 pieces were pre-ordered. In total, more than 130 pieces were pre-ordered in two days. The third solo exhibition is expected to be held in mid-May.</p>

<h3>National Games to Borrow Equipment from Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The National Games were held in Hangzhou last year. All sports equipment and other items were newly purchased. The prepared seats were especially simple and beautiful. After the closing ceremony, they were ordered to be kept by the Zhejiang Education Department. Recently, it was heard that the Capital National Games plans to transfer the aforementioned items from Zhejiang in order to save public funds. However, the provincial government has not yet received an express document for transfer and borrowing. If it is true, the Education Department plans to wait until the opening of the provincial games before it can be transferred.</p>
<p>Ji'nan Football and Zhenru Basketball Team's Conquest of the Philippines (9)</p>
<p>(Our reporter Wen Chu sent from Manila on February 1st)</p>
<h3>Alumni Discuss Fundraising</h3>
<p>In addition to the athletes showing off their skills in the sports arena, there are also many memorable values. Ji'nan University's team's conquest of the Philippines has two major missions. On the one hand, it is to connect with the compatriots in the Philippines and promote Sino-Philippine relations. On the other hand, due to the urgent need for funds for various construction projects in the sports industry, it is hoped that enthusiastic overseas Chinese businessmen will provide full assistance. Its fundraising declaration has been published in the Chinese daily newspapers here. Therefore, in the name of Ji'nan University, a reception was held at the New Paris Hotel (January 25th morning) for the purpose of preparing for fundraising to help the alma mater's magnificent stadium realize it as soon as possible. All the alumni were very enthusiastic. As a result, they were divided into four groups, three people in each group, to raise funds from the overseas Chinese community. The first group was Yang Tuanbiao, Yang Wenhui, and Yang Baoxing. The second group was Li Mingxiang, Wang Yunyu, and Huang Jinqing. The third group was Gui Huayue, Wu Xu, and Huang Fuyao. The fourth group was Shi Hanfu, Cai Wenqing, and He Daren.</p>
<h3>Honorary Advisors Banquet</h3>
<p>It was originally planned to hold a big dance party on February 1st, Sunday night, to comfort the athletes. However, according to the announcement of the staff, they wanted to return to Shanghai by boat on the 31st. Because the preparation was not timely, it was moved to the Central Bank Club on the 28th night for a banquet. Welcome is also to welcome.</p>
<p>▲ Many Wise Men Gathered The attendees were mostly Chinese and foreign names. There were more than 100 guests in total. In addition to the advisory group and the players, there were Chinese and foreign reporters and important figures from the business and academic communities. For a time, they talked and laughed and praised the sports achievements of the athletes.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech The chairman that night was Mr. Chen Yingchang, the president of the Chamber of Commerce. He has been re-elected as the president of the Overseas Chinese Education Association for 14 years, and now he has been re-elected as the president of the Chamber of Commerce. He is a leader in the overseas Chinese community. In his speech, the general idea was that the players' coming to the Philippines had left a deep impression on us. Although the basketball team did not win all the games, they also benefited a lot from attacking the wrong mountains. I hope that you will not only win in the next Far Eastern Games, but also achieve good results in the World Games in order to enhance the international status of the motherland. There were also speeches by Dr. Zheng Hanhong and Mr. Lin Zhuguang, who also encouraged each other in their praise.</p>
<p>▲ Guest's Reply Chen Zhang'e, the chief of the team, replied on behalf of the basketball team, saying that the basketball team did not come to compete this time, but to learn.</p>
<p>I deeply hope that there will be a second and third conquest of the Philippines in the future, and that football will have the same good results. Jiang Shanzhi replied on behalf of the football team, saying that although the football team has achieved some results this time, there are still many shortcomings in Ji'nan University's sports construction. I hope that enthusiastic overseas Chinese compatriots will provide full assistance so that this Nanchang university can create healthy students, that is, directly create healthy children for you in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Presenting Silver Cups The honorary advisors also prepared two large silver cups, one for the football team (to add glory to the country), represented by the captain Dai Linjing, and one for the basketball team (to promote our martial arts), received by the chief of the team Chen Zhang'e. Everyone wished for great victory, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ Chat After the Dinner The Charity Association originally wanted to keep the football team for two more games. The ticket revenue, after deducting expenses, would be half for the Charity Association and half for Ji'nan University's sports development funds. Because of this unexpected storm that occurred today, the main members of the advisory group mostly advocated that it would be better not to compete again, lest there be another accident. As for the issue of developing Ji'nan University's sports, the Chinese businessmen will donate as much as they can.</p>
<h3>Athletes Tour Baguio</h3>
<p>The secretary-general of the Charity Association, Chen, specially prepared a special car for the athletes to visit Baguio, a summer resort in East Asia, because of their hard work and high merits. Mr. Chen also wanted to invite me to go with them. I was on vacation and had been to this place for three days, so I declined his kindness. I recently sent more than a dozen landscape paintings of Baguio to this newspaper's pictorial, entitled (Nanhua Paradise), and also wrote an article (Twenty Years and Three Tours to Baguio), which was sent to Life Weekly (it has not yet been published). The pine trees and cypress waves, mountain scenery and lake light in this place have greatly opened the eyes of tourists.</p>
<h3>Grand Occasion of the Dance Party</h3>
<p>On the night of the 31st, the Charity Association specially held a consolation party, and all the athletes and staff members were invited, and prizes were issued. The Ji'nan Football Team won the football championship and was awarded a large cup. The Philippine Boxing Team won three out of five games against Japan and was also awarded a silver cup. All the other athletes were awarded a badge as a souvenir. After the dinner, a dance party was held. The temples and clothes were fragrant, and the skirts were interlaced, which was also a great event for a while.</p>

<h3>Hunter's Tale  Xuechang</h3>
<p>The Bailu Mountain in the northern countryside of Yuhang is a place of undulating peaks and dense bamboo and forests. Tigers and leopards frequently roam there. There is a man from Yong called Qiu Abing, who lives at the foot of the mountain. Early last month, Qiu's cousin, Cao, came from Fenghua to stay at Qiu's house. One day, Cao climbed the mountain for sightseeing and suddenly caught sight of tiger tracks halfway up the mountain. Cao was an experienced hunter. Upon seeing the tiger tracks, he returned to Fenghua to retrieve his bow and arrows and set them up at the original location of the tracks in preparation for shooting the tiger. That evening, a tiger was killed nearby. The tiger weighed more than two hundred catties and was sold to a certain pharmacy in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>After Cao captured the tiger, many nosy people inquired about the circumstances of his hunt. Cao said, "Hunters must recognize the tracks of tigers to have any chance of success. The tracks in the mountains often reveal the tiger's movements. Some tracks indicate that the tiger has already gone far away and will only return after several years. Others indicate that the tiger has not gone far and will return in a few days. Some indicate that the tiger is only passing through and will never come again. Some indicate that the tiger is still on this mountain or nearby. All of these things are revealed in the tracks. The other day, when I climbed Bailu Mountain for sightseeing, I saw tiger tracks. Upon careful examination, I knew that the tiger had been there the day before and had already gone elsewhere, but would definitely return in seven days. However, I did not bring my bow and arrows with me this time, so I returned home to retrieve them. When I returned with the bow and arrows, it was already the seventh day. So I climbed the mountain and set up the trap. That evening, the tiger did return and was caught." Cao also said, "The arrows for shooting tigers rely on poison, so that even a strong and powerful tiger can be killed instantly. The poison must be tested thoroughly first. The method of testing is to take a large frog and use a needle dipped in a small amount of poison to prick the frog's body. If the frog is pricked and dies instantly without moving, then the poison can be used to shoot tigers, because the tiger will definitely fall down dead after being shot. If the frog moves several times before dying, then the tiger will definitely cross several ridges before falling. Each time the frog moves before dying, the tiger will cross one ridge before falling. So, if the frog jumps around and dies, then the tiger will die in an unknown location and its body will be impossible to find." Cao also said, "When the tiger is shot, blood will flow out. When the tiger sees blood, it will lick it with its tongue. Then the poison from the wound will immediately be transmitted from its tongue into its internal organs. Its death will be sudden," and so on.</p>
<h3>Letter to Deng Fenweng Jing Mengdie</h3>
<p>Deng Zi Fenweng, whose real name is Dun Tie, is an old friend of mine from ten years ago. At that time, Ni Ziyi Chi of Zhenhai founded the Yousheng Society in Shanghai. Weng and I were both members of the society, and thus we formed a friendship based on our literary connection. Jun has a solitary and eccentric nature, preferring quiet and disliking noise. Although he grew up by the sea, he never set foot in dance halls or opera houses. He only loved the things in his cup. Several years ago, there was a rumor that he had died drunk. This was because Jun always drank wherever he went, with the same air of Liu Bolun, saying, "Bury me where I die." He usually amused himself with calligraphy and engraving. Sometimes, when he was satisfied with his work, he would send me a paper to show me. His calligraphy is proficient in all styles, but I especially love his cursive script, which has the strength of spring worms and autumn snakes, and the grace of returning swallows. I also like to write cursive script, but I am not skilled at it. Jun is also humorous and self-satisfied. His "P-Taste Room Poetry Collection" is extremely playful and funny. Because of poverty, he married late. On the wedding night, he hung paper money and paper ingots to decorate the door of the bridal chamber, which was his way of expressing himself. When I visited Shanghai, I met him in the society. (He was on Nanjing Road) His person was simple and majestic, looking like a mountain monk or a strong man from Yan and Zhao, completely unlike his calligraphy and poetry. We had been friends for a long time, but when we met, he was silent. This was because he was not used to speaking unless he was drunk, and I, by nature, did not drink. Therefore, we could only look at each other and smile, as Zhuangzi said, with a tacit understanding in our hearts. After we parted, he remembered me and sent me a poem, saying, "Our party praises Jingzi for his talent, his literary grace is unparalleled. In places of song and dance with sandalwood clappers and golden cups, the threads of emotion entangle a bitter poet." He meant that I liked to enjoy music and often wrote about actors, such as Furongcao, Liu Yuqin, and Fenhua, and others. Since then, Jun's residence has moved frequently, and I have been busy with mundane affairs. We have lost contact. Suddenly, several years have passed. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that Jun's calligraphy and engraving exhibition was appreciated by the two Western gods, Shou Juan, and was also praised in writing (see this column and Kuai Huo Lin last month). Upon reading it, I felt like hearing a beautiful guqin melody or listening to a flute in the forest. I felt the flow of autumn water and felt like the person was still there. I also knew that Jun's art was progressing and I was ashamed of my own decline. My longing grew even stronger. Therefore, I wrote about the old events to record my new sorrow, and echoed the original rhyme with two poems: "I miss the old Tie of the Lotus Society, who is very talented and unmatched. Outside the land of drunkenness, there is no place to stay, so I entrust this body to a famous mountain. Ten years of separation have led to loneliness, but the virtue of wine remains in memory of Bolun. If you ask about the old poets before the cup, they are old poets under ten thousand plum blossoms." (I am staying at the Shenxin Factory in Wuxi, and the owner, Rong, is the owner of Meiyuan.) I think my old friend will be consoled by this.</p>
<h3>The Virgin's Abduction in Jinshan's Southern Countryside Late Success</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I met some fellow villagers from Jinshan's southern countryside who came to Shanghai. They talked at length about the tragic situation of banditry in our hometown, which saddened those who heard it. In the evening, I almost burst into tears and shouted, "Our hometown! A hometown in deep water and fiery heat! Alas!"</p>
<p>The area of Jinshan's southern countryside, including Zhangyan, Qianxu, Jinshanwei, Ganxiang, Langxia... has almost become a world of bandits. Within a month, within a single day, there are countless incidents of extortion and robbery. Large groups of people, in broad daylight, rampage through the towns and villages without any fear or restraint, as if there is no one else around. Saying these few words in the evening, I am afraid some people will not believe it, but they are all facts. Punan, which has always been known as a peaceful land, has actually come to this. It is truly something that we southern villagers never imagined.</p>
<p>The most pitiful thing is that young virgins in the countryside, around the age of sixteen, once they are targeted by the bandits, are often abducted, raped, and forced into marriage. Therefore, families with young daughters all hide them at home and are unwilling to let them go out easily. This is exactly what the old saying says: "Women hide while men run wild." One night last month, bandits abducted a young girl at the east gate of Jinshanwei. The girl cried and screamed loudly. The bandit said in a boastful tone: "I told you not to go back, but you didn't. It's late at night, so you definitely wanted me (the bandit referring to himself) to drag you..." These few words were told to me by a friend from Jinshanwei. Originally, my friend heard the occurrence of this tragedy with his own ears. The next day, everyone said that the girl who was crying and screaming last night was the one who had been abducted by the bandits. My friend then suddenly realized. Other cases of people being robbed by bandits are too numerous to describe. Middle-class families have already moved elsewhere, especially those with young daughters.</p>
<p>Alas, the virgin's abduction in the southern countryside! Alas, the weak Jinshan people! Alas, those who are responsible for maintaining law and order...</p>
<h3>Epitaph for Yi Junshifu (Part 1) Ningxiang Cheng Songwan</h3>
<p>Alas! Yi Shifu was a benevolent man of his time. From his youth to his old age and death, he always put filial piety first, loyalty second, integrity third, discretion fourth, broad love fifth, and lament sixth, with respect to his family, country, and the world. He exhausted himself to serve others in order to return to Heaven. Man's feelings are a suppression of Heaven's feelings. Heaven's laws for man are a warning. This talent is extraordinary and can never be reborn. His personal name was Shun Ding, his courtesy name Zhongshi, and he was from Hanshou, Hunan. During the Ming Dynasty, Wanli, a man named Xiangyu moved from Fengcheng. His great-grandfather was named Zhengyuan, his grandfather was named Tiancheng, and his father was named Peishen, who was an outstanding tribute student and served as an official with the first-rank hat button in Jiangsu and Shanxi.</p>
<p>He was commissioned to suppress bandits in Shaanxi, leaving his family in Hanzhong. When the city fell, Jun was captured by the false Prince Qi and detained in the bandit camp. He was transferred to Yingshan, where he encountered the monk Prince Zhong's troops, who defeated the bandits. Jun joined the refugees and fled to the monk's army. The prince asked if he could write, held him on his lap, and pointed out his family history in great detail. The prince was greatly surprised and ordered the county magistrate, Zhu Banyun, to escort him back to the Commissioner of Administration in Lizhou. He was only six years old. He wrote a difficult essay, which was known as a divine work. At the age of fourteen, he won first place in the county examination and was supported by the county school. He passed the imperial examination in the Guangxu year of Yihai. He paid to become a secretary in the Ministry of Punishments, Shanxi Department. At that time, his poetry had been collected and circulated, and his talent was famous throughout the country. He failed the metropolitan examination six times. Finally, a certain examiner recognized Jun's paper and deliberately rejected it. Jun then changed his career and became a candidate for official in Henan, overseeing the three bureaus of tax collection, disaster relief, and water conservancy. He supervised the Lu River project and served as the general director of the three-province river map bureau. He supervised the Henan provincial examination in the Wuzi year. He was awarded the title of Surveillance Commissioner and the second-rank hat button for presenting the three-province river map. After two years, he retired to Lushan and built a thatched cottage in the Three Gorges Ravine. He served his parents between Jiang and Xiang. Zhang Wenxiang Gong hired him to teach classics and literature in Lianghu. Soon after, he mourned his mother and lived in seclusion, almost killing himself. He begged for money and nearly drowned himself. Tears flowed like ointment. He then called himself the Crying Hermit. In the year of Jiawu, after the mourning period, the Sino-Japanese War broke out. Liu Zhongcheng Gong requested that Jun be summoned to join the military staff. Jun obeyed his father's orders and went to serve in mourning clothes. He arrived in Beijing and submitted tens of thousands of words to the emperor, saying that he was not afraid of fighting, but afraid that after one battle, they would eventually return to peace. He was not afraid of eventually returning to peace, but afraid of losing the basis for fighting and peace. The key was to punish before rewarding, and to punish Li Hongzhang first. Only by not condoning and loving him could his reputation be preserved and great results achieved. Therefore, war is necessary for peace. Punishment is necessary for reward. The current opinion agreed with him.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the White Goose Painting Exhibition Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>Changchun Road in northern Shanghai is lush with trees and has towering foreign buildings. It is quiet in the midst of the bustling city and is a perfect place to live in seclusion. The White Goose Painting Society is located there. The painting society was established by my friends Fang Xuegu and Chen Qiucao. They are all working hard on their paintings and have a considerable position in the arts. I visited this painting exhibition with my friends Dan Jun and Du Yu. There were many works that were pleasing to the eye. The doors were all painted silver-grey. Climbing the stairs, it was a delightful experience. Fang Xuegu's works, especially his nude oil paintings, were masterpieces. The nude woman sat with her chin in her hand, lost in thought. The natural and beautiful posture was indescribable. Du Yu Jun praised it highly. The sketches of villages and fields achieved a state of divinity in terms of color, brushstrokes, and light. They were truly excellent works. Chen Qiucao's human body paintings showed the posture of lying on his back with his head in his arms. The curves were fully displayed, which was also a rare piece. Summer Night on Changchun Road shows the local scenery with thick colors, revealing a sense of obscurity and exuberance. Pan Sitong is known for his watercolor paintings, so he displayed many watercolor paintings. The Suzhou River frame, waterfront houses, a boat slowly paddling. Staring intently at it, I could not help but feel nostalgic for my hometown. His oil paintings of portraits and nudes were also strong. Those who are capable are capable of everything. Ms. Lihua's Flower Girl in the Snow shows the cold in a small space, which is suitable for reading in the hot summer. The works of Du Xueou, Hu Zhongping, and other researchers were dazzling, with no less than hundreds of points. It is a pity that we glanced at them hastily, like riding a horse to look at flowers. I feel that I have failed this great event.</p>

<h3>Warmth in the Heart (368) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Seventeen She had the art of preserving her looks with her dark eyebrows and the ability to extend her life with gold.</p>
<p>Those two big bags of clothes. When they were made, wasn't every piece the latest style? Altogether, including the materials and the tailor's fee, it must have cost six or seven hundred dollars. Who knew that when they were taken to the pawnshop, they couldn't even be pawned for a hundred dollars. It turned out that the clothes that Flower Old Six had were all single-layered, lined with cotton or velvet. There wasn't a single piece of leather clothing. The Huizhou pawnshop clerk said that if there were a few pieces of leather clothing, they could be taken apart and remade. Clothes like that were simply worthless. They weren't even worth as much as an old cotton robe from the countryside. However, when Flower Old Six had them made, didn't every piece cost tens of dollars? The materials were all imported from France or England. Every foot cost five or six dollars, and every yard cost more than ten dollars. The foreign silk and satin shops sent clerks to the houses to solicit business. Or the familiar tailors sent the new materials to the door when they arrived. They talked non-stop. "Miss Six, this is brand new. Miss Four from Qinghefang cut a piece, and Miss Five from Yingchunfang snatched a set. If you're late, they'll all be snatched up. You told me before to bring you any new patterns first, so I especially left them for you." Sometimes, they would also say that the patterns were special and the colors were bright and only a few fashionable ladies like you could afford them. Like a charcoal basket covering it up, Flower Yuanchun was born to be someone who enjoyed flattery. She never asked about the price of things she bought. She would even complain that people didn't bring them to her first. But when she cut two pieces this month and two pieces the next month, the money added up to seven or eight hundred dollars by the end of the season. Moreover, the tailors would think of all kinds of new ways to increase their wages. How to hem, how to roll, what kind of buttons to make, just to make it seem unique and new. The labor cost for one piece of clothing was more than ten dollars. By the end of the season, that was another two or three hundred dollars. When it was no longer fashionable, not only was it worthless, but it was also annoying and ridiculous. Pawnshops were most afraid of that kind of clothing. Don't say that it's already a thing of the past. Even if it's still fashionable in this era, if you pawn it, you can't sell it right away. At least you have to keep it for eighteen months. You think the style of clothing in Shanghai is constantly changing. The clothes made in the first half of the year are completely unfashionable in the second half of the year. New styles have been introduced. It's as if the situation has changed and a new dynasty has been established. After serving that eighteen-month sentence, you have to keep it for a few more months before you can print a package and send it out. When it arrives at the clothing store, it's already haggard, like a prisoner who has served a long sentence. Although they've been released, their hair is full of white, and they can already be considered not to be people of this world. When that kind of clothing arrives at the clothing store, the clothing store owners also frown. Honest people don't want to wear that kind of fancy clothing. Those who like fancy clothing think it's unfashionable. It's really a case of the poor not wanting it and the rich not loving it.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Speculation Drives Prices Madly</h3>
<p>▲New Record of Seven Hundred and Ninety Taels</p>
<p>▲Crazy Run Initiated at Two Taels and Seven Mace</p>
<p>▲Unstoppable Rise Inevitable</p>
<p>The rising trend of gold speculation on February 9th yesterday was unstoppable, breaking the previous new record and reaching a shocking and unprecedented peak of seven hundred and ninety taels. Everyone was left speechless. The total difference throughout the day was seventeen taels. However, the waves were turbulent, with fluctuations of several taels at every turn. Trading among fellow businesses was quite active, with buyers accounting for the majority. Hengxingsheng, Dafuchang, Tongtaichang, Wanxingshunli, and others were all buying in. Zhifeng, Yongfu Yu, and retail investors were selling out. As for the overseas silver market, yesterday's telegraphic message from Yang stated that British silver was not moving, while American silver was low. People's confidence was strengthened, and the price of gold penetrated the 770-tael barrier early in the morning. Afterwards, the issuance of drafts frequently shrank by two points, especially the prices for bank transactions, which were extremely tight, even breaking within two pence. As a result, the market momentum developed greatly, showing signs of reaching its peak, with a sharp increase of more than ten taels. However, there was a fluctuation of six or seven taels at noon, due to the differences among the treasuries of various firms. In the afternoon, Jiyuanxing, Yonghengxing, Zhaokang, and others bought in, while the Dalian Gang and Taikang Run were all more sellers than buyers. The price fluctuated around 785 taels. The wind and waves were not as turbulent as in the morning. In the end, the buying momentum was strong, and it suddenly broke through 790 taels. It is said that the big bars will fall again this morning.</p>
<p>▲High Jump Seen at Market Opening From The Start. The March market opened this morning with a jump of six taels and seven mace to 773 taels. Big bars were affected by the lack of a telegram from Monday, and yesterday's telegram showed silver prices down 3/8, then recovering a small five mace. Wanxingshunli Hengxing Yucheng Yong and others all entered the market, so prices gradually rose by five or six taels, with only one or two tael fluctuations. The first HSBC absorbed two pence initially, then two pence point zero six two five. The first HSBC release shrank by 0.25 USD and Japanese gold added three cents, but the market was not moved. At this time, it was seventy-eight taels and a half. Since it had already been hyped up long ago. Then there was a one-to-two tael difference, from eight to nine taels. It seemed that more people were selling in the market, falling back to seven taels. The internal HSBC was flat, then HSBC absorbed two pence again, and Tongdachang Shunli Wanxing came in, already rising by more than three taels, and HSBC suddenly announced that the exchange rate had shrunk, counting as a 1.25 shilling, 0.25 USD, and 1.5 cents of Japanese gold to eighty taels point zero five mace at 9:50 AM. Zhifeng Yong and others sold out. The March British gold was exchanged by various banks at two pence. By 10:00 AM, it was 78 taels and a half.

The initial announced price was sixty-two or three taels, then after 11:00 AM, the Japanese gold was changed to one tael point seven mace point seven five, also changing to eight hundred and fifty-six taels and two mace, about seventy odd taels to sixty-seven or eight taels.</p>
<p>▲Restoration Drives Prices Higher. The market opened in the afternoon at eighty-eight and a half taels, then fluctuated by about one tael, moving from eight to nine taels, two to three mace. Because Taikang Run, Heng Yu, Shunli, etc. sold out, and the British gold exchange rate was flat, with March being able to close at a rate of one pence point eight seven five, the price fell to eighty-four and a half taels. Afterwards, there were slight buyers, with the price at eighty-seven taels at 1:30 PM. Due to zero households and the Dalian gang selling off, the price was eighty-three and a half taels at 2:45 PM.

<h3>Unmatched Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>▲ Posted Rates Repeatedly Contracted Three Times</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants Selling Off British Exchange</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets, due to it being the beginning of the week and the absence of telegraphic transfer postings, foreign exchange rates repeatedly contracted three times, totaling a decrease of two notches (half a penny) in British gold, already breaking within two pennies. The exchange rate for one US dollar rose by six and a quarter points daily. From the early morning, British gold contracted by 0.25, US dollars by 0.5, Indian rupees by 1.5, French francs by 12, German marks by 2, and Dutch guilders by 1.25.

As for the domestic market, it was also tense, already breaking the two-penny mark. Consequently, the gold market continued to surge, soaring by more than 20 taels. In the afternoon, it broke through the 790 tael mark, breaking previous records. In summary, the foreign exchange market was agitated by the gold market. The market sentiment was high, and demand from major players exceeded supply. However, Chinese merchants and head offices sold off British exchange, resulting in approximately over 300,000 pounds worth of gold transactions. Banks such as HSBC, Société Générale, Mackinnon Mackenzie, Mitsui, Sino-Belgian, and Yokohama Specie Bank all absorbed these sales. There were also interbank transactions of over 100,000 pounds. However, afternoon trading was not as buoyant as the morning session. The Bank of East Asia, Shanghai Bank, and Sumitomo Bank slightly sold off, while only Standard Oil settled in US dollars. There were few transactions in Japanese yen. By the end of the afternoon, compared to last Saturday, British gold had decreased by half a penny, US dollars by one yuan, and Japanese yen had surged by six and a quarter points. The sharpness of the market atmosphere was truly astonishing.</p>

<h3>Overnight Loan Market Remains Chaotic</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Due to commercial customs in Shanghai, as the lunar year-end approaches, the various procedures that need to be expedited and resolved are several times busier than during the solar New Year. Therefore, the complexity of current settlement procedures is unique to this time of year, resulting in sluggishness in various market transactions, as there is truly no time for them. Yesterday, market conditions and prices were chaotic, and market sentiment was calm. It is anticipated that there will be no significant upward trend in the next few days.</p>
<p>▲ Overnight Loan Prices: The daily interest rate (yang li) in the morning market was 0.072075, slightly lower by 0.000125 than the previous day. The afternoon market rebounded by 0.000375 to 0.0721125, likely due to fewer sellers and slightly more buyers. (Silver overnight loans) Both the morning and afternoon markets were still offered interest-free loans, and clearing was also interest-free. The abundance of silver funds is almost unprecedented.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: Both the morning and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver coins were 0.0678, with 12,000 jiao transacted in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins, after surging the previous day, fell slightly yesterday, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 0.0683, with 130,000 jiao transacted in the morning market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins also rebounded by 1,000 coins to 349,000 coins.</p>
<p>▲ Silver and Foreign Currency Inflows and Outflows: (Silver Funds) Yesterday, bank settlements, due to it being Monday, seemed slightly higher than usual. Chinese merchants settled 3,890,000 yuan in bills, foreign merchants settled 3,230,000 yuan in bills, settlement of current accounts was over 4,000,000 yuan, special accounts settlement was over 2,000,000 yuan, and settlement of various remittance taxes and other funds was over 8,000,000 yuan, with 1,800,000 yuan withdrawn from warehouses.

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Fall Slightly by Six to Seven Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bond trading situation showed light activity in the futures market in the morning, with slightly increased activity in the afternoon. Spot transactions were only sporadic. The trend of various bonds yesterday was relatively stable in the early morning, with little change in the second session. However, in the afternoon, selling pressure suddenly increased in the market, and various bonds suddenly turned weak. Bonds such as the 96 Customs Bond, 19 Good, and 20 Year Cigarette Bonds experienced significant declines. As a result, compared to last weekend, various bonds fell by six to seven points, while others fell by two to three points. However, the large note of the 19 Customs Bond and the spot of the 19 Good bond rose by one yuan. The spot of the demobilization of troops and the seven-year financial futures also continued to rise by half a yuan.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation of Cotton Yarn Surging</h3>
<p>▲ New Buyers Increase Special Margin by Twenty Taels Per Piece</p>
<p>▲ Market Prices Cannot Exceed the Previous Morning's Closing Price</p>
<p>▲ Auction Suspended from the 14th, Numbered Sales Continue as Usual</p>
<p>The sharp rise in the yarn market is a rare occurrence in history. It is entirely affected by exchange rates, making all goods expensive. Cotton prices are soaring due to high prices of foreign cotton, making it impossible to take a relaxed view of the yarn market from the fundamental perspective of raw cotton prices rising step by step. As a result, new buyers are flocking in, and the situation is becoming increasingly tight. New buyers are staying away, leading to further price increases and an appearance of endless rises. However, trading in current yarn is exceptionally slow, and various firms are not making purchases due to account closures. According to some, several firms have been short-covering, while a certain industrialist remains in a long position. In the afternoon, brokers convened an emergency meeting. Given the recent sharp rise and the inability of sellers to provide sufficient margin, it was decided to increase the special margin for new purchases by twenty taels per piece to avoid risks. Subsequently, market prices cannot exceed the previous morning's closing price. When the market reopened in the afternoon, both sides remained deadlocked for several minutes. The first two auction sessions were empty. The third auction session had some closing transactions, and sellers became weak. Prices for each month fell by one to two taels, and a storm temporarily subsided. The future remains unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Discovery of a Black Market Amid the Deadlock</p>
<p>Market prices soared upon opening in the morning. Because the settlement period is approaching, retail investors are unable to sustain and are reluctantly liquidating. The buying pressure is becoming stronger, and retail investors are panicking to the extreme. Prices for each month jumped by more than two taels. Closing prices also rose. As a result, prices for each month rose by 0.09 to 4.1 taels. The first two sessions in the afternoon were black market sessions. The second and third sessions slightly eased, falling by 0.07 to 1.9 taels. Total trading volume for the day was 47,950 bales. Dafu sold 1,750 bales, Tiancheng 1,650 bales, Changfeng 1,850 bales, and Xincheng 3,800 bales. Yudai bought 1,750 bales, Gongtai 1,800 bales, Tongfeng 1,350 bales, and Shenchang 2,000 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Closing Prices and Inventory (Tael)</p>
<p>Month Closing Price Change Inventory</p>
<p>February 1654 Up 0.09 28,550</p>
<p>March 1580 Up 2.21 53,500</p>
<p>April 1708 Up 2.29 60,200</p>
<p>May 1720 Up 2.65 6,450</p>
<p>June 1718 Up 2.22 46,500</p>
<p>July 1721 Up 1.1 14,000</p>
<p>▲ Stagnant Current Yarn Sales as Settlement Period Nears</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are stagnant due to the approaching settlement period. According to statistics, various firms bought a total of 400 bales. Among them, domestic firms bought 100 bales, Tianjin firms bought 150 bales, mainland firms bought 170 bales, Fuzhou firms bought 10 bales, and Yingkou firms bought 5 bales. Prices have risen by 2 to 3 taels.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Prices Surge by Two to Four Taels</h3>
<p>▲ Market Filled with Buying Demand</p>
<p>▲ New Long Positions Increase Special Margin by Ten Taels</p>
<p>The upward trend in the cotton market is intensifying. Due to the unusual contraction in foreign exchange rates, the cost of foreign cotton is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, new buyers are flocking in, and sellers are hesitant to act rashly due to the unfavorable trend. With the buying pressure becoming stronger and market sentiment becoming extremely panicked, this has led to such a sharp rise. In the afternoon, brokers convened an emergency meeting. It was decided to increase the special margin for each new purchase by ten taels, and future prices cannot exceed the closing price of the previous morning. The afternoon market atmosphere was slightly calmer, but sellers remained scarce, and the future remains difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Rapid Rise in Chinese Cotton Due to Exchange Rate Contraction. The exchange opened at a Chinese cotton exchange, and the exchange rate reduction intensified buying interest. Each month rose by more than one tael. The rise in the second and third sessions remained strong. As a result, each rose by 1.2 to 4 taels. The first two sessions in the afternoon were black market sessions, and the second session closed slightly more calmly, falling back by 0.05 to 0.7 taels. Total trading volume for the day was 80,500 dan. Hengyi sold 3,500 dan, Mingde 2,700 dan, Ruidai 2,100 dan, Hengde 2,500 dan, and Changfeng 2,800 dan. Shenchang bought 4,200 dan, Changfeng 3,300 dan, and Gongtai 1,800 dan. The closing prices for Chinese cotton are listed below.</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton Closing Prices and Inventory (Dan)</p>
<p>Month Closing Price Change Inventory</p>
<p>February 4195 Up 1.3 66,000</p>
<p>March 4195 Up 1.05 119,700</p>
<p>April 4240 Up 1.4 116,000</p>

<p>June 4210 Up 0.85 107,000</p>
<p>July 4200 Up 0.5 37,500</p>
<p>▲ Current Cotton Merchants Are Keen to Hoard. Current cotton trading is flat, but with the continued contraction in exchange rates and market sentiment remaining panicked, futures prices are rising sharply. Those holding goods are still keen to hoard. The origin sources are 300 bales of Yao cotton and more than 800 bales of Tong cotton. The selling prices are listed below.</p>

<h3>Grain: Standard Flour Skyrockets by Seven Points</h3>
<p>▲ Speculators are Intoxicated and Frenzied</p>
<p>▲ 1.4 Million Transactions</p>
<p>▲ Forward Contracts All Break the Two-Tael Mark</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw fierce and frenzied rises in all months. The huge trading volume for the day was also among the highest in recent years, reaching over 1.4 million in both the morning and afternoon sessions, as can be imagined from the intensity of the competition. The causes of this rise are: firstly, Fuxin's permission to withdraw cash in previous months has consolidated the position of standard flour; secondly, following the major earthquake in Australia, there has been no selling of foreign wheat for a week, leading market participants to believe that the factory no longer has the capacity to suppress prices. Recently, customers from the Yangtze River region, due to the high price of current flour, have been sending telegrams and letters in large quantities to purchase standard flour, which is relatively cheap. In Shanghai, customers trading in cotton yarn are also very active in buying because all goods are rising with the gold market, and flour prices must also be raised. Accumulating these several factors, market sentiment is gradually rising, becoming unstoppable. Although the factory still has output, it is like a drop in the bucket and cannot help. The 2nd, 4th, and 5th months have all broken the two-tael mark. The rise in the sixth month is even more intense. As a result, this month rose by 0.45 compared to the previous week, March rose by 0.525, April and May rose by 0.575, and June rose by 0.725, and July rose by 0.75.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Surge Along With Gold Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Bulls Release Prices and Force Upward ... Forward Prices Rise by About Two Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market also saw an unusual frenzy. The rise in the near term seemed slightly calmer, while the extent of the frenzy in the far term reached a massive two qian. The reasons for this rise are roughly similar to the flour market. What the buyers fear is the selling of foreign wheat, but the current foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada has not been sold for a long time. Due to the earthquake, Australia has also not been inquired about for a long time, causing the attitude of the short sellers to become fearful. The buyers are very arrogant and repeatedly force prices upward. This unexpected frenzy is also driven by gold prices. As a result, this month rose by 0.06 compared to the previous week, March rose by 0.08, April rose by 0.1, May rose by 0.13, June rose by 0.18, and July rose by 0.19.</p>
<h3>Passenger Rice Has Sales in Southern Provinces</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xian rice still had no large-scale sales, and only a few merchants on this street inquired about it. The market was generally stable. However, new passenger rice had sales in Guangxi and was purchased by local merchants, causing prices to rise. Since inventory was low, prices were relatively firm. However, since the end of the year is approaching, the market price is not expected to fluctuate significantly or fall sharply. Yesterday, the total market transactions were 300 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at 11.45 yuan and over 600 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice at 12.78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybeans Soar by One Qian</h3>
<p>▲ Soybeans Yesterday's futures bean market was excellent. After the opening in the morning, buying interest was strong because Dalian telegraphed high prices last week. Japanese grain merchants were smoothly purchasing current beans. In addition, the authorities in the three northeastern provinces were exerting effort to adjust the situation in order to maintain the North Manchurian soybean market. Therefore, market sentiment was greatly strengthened, and the Shanghai gold market was also soaring. With all the market conditions excellent, empty positions were striving to enter the market. In the afternoon, the March contract reached 4.83 taels. The speed of this change was truly unexpected. The closing prices for February were up 0.08, and the March, April, and May contracts were all up 0.1.</p>
<p>▲ Bean Cakes Yesterday's cake market moved upward along with raw materials. In both the morning and afternoon sessions, domestic and foreign merchants were consistently and smoothly purchasing. In addition, Japanese and Western merchants were eagerly purchasing current cakes in the Dalian market, so the conditions here were no less favorable than soybeans. The total trading volume also reached tens of thousands of pieces. As a result, compared to last weekend, the March and May contracts were up 0.03, the April contract was up 0.025, and the June contract was up 0.0275.</p>
<h3>Dried Seafood Scallops Are Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>The scallop inventory in the shops at the end of the street is already very tight. Furthermore, it is reported that the production market has recently surged by more than ten yuan. If calculated based on the current exchange rate, the cost would increase by an additional 25 to 26 taels. Therefore, companies with inventory are seizing the opportunity to hoard and sell. Yesterday's market prices for medium-sized high-quality scallops were 240 taels, large scallops were 228.3 taels, scallops were 185 taels to 177 taels, crushed scallops were 192 taels, Aomori scallops were 165 taels, and Yantai scallops were 153 taels. However, although the market is scarce and in demand, sales to customers are inevitably weakening due to the high prices. Recently, apart from some sporadic transactions on this street, there have been no purchases.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Dried Cocoons Show Increasing Demand</h3>
<p>▲ Factories Increase Raw Material Replenishment, Reopening Operations, and Pushing up Cocoon Prices by 20-30 Taels</p>
<p>The inventory of dried cocoons in Shanghai is scarce, and the market shows increasing demand. After the New Year, factories saw a turnaround in European sales and soaring silk prices, so the cocoon market rose accordingly. Before long, European sales trended to fatigue, silk prices plummeted, and the cocoon market remained robust. Recently, silk factories have been planning to resume operations and replenishing raw materials, further boosting market sentiment. Medium-quality cocoons now require 1,020 to 1,030 taels, an increase of 20 to 30 taels compared to before.</p>
<h3>Gaoyang Zhenmei Tea Shows Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in Shanghai, including Wuyuan Xizhuang Zhenmei and Baochang Yanghang Tea, had opened for business. However, sales were not widespread, and selling prices had fallen within 100 taels. The market situation was still uncertain. Low-to-medium-grade Zhenmei, Zhunmei, green tea from Fushi, Tongfu, and Yongxing, among other firms, also showed slight interest. The selling price of Zhunmei has continued to rise by 1 to 2 taels compared to before, while there were no transactions for Gongxi Xiu Mei, and similar tea items.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: New High Prices Emerge Endlessly</h3>
<p>Due to dramatic changes in foreign exchange rates and a sharp decline in silver prices, coupled with the rising prices of cotton yarn and silk, the piece goods market is seeing a constant emergence of new high prices. Yesterday's opening prices set a new record. Wild Goose was priced at 4.05 taels, British Ganguan at 4 taels, Zhongshan Flanel at 3.25 taels, Yang Guifei Big Huiwen at 2.125 taels, and wool silk fabric was not for sale. Tianjin merchants were actively searching, and more than 30 pieces of popular Dahongguang Xiexie, Keai Meiren, and Tang Taizong were priced at 5.5 taels. Huiguang Xiexie had also been bid up to 5.5 taels. Even Yuehua, which had been withdrawn from the market, saw a turnaround yesterday, with medium-sized pieces selling for 2.05 taels and small-sized pieces for 1.95 taels. However, the attitude of merchants on this street remains cold, with only a few sales and few outside purchases. As the lunar New Year approaches, merchants' attitudes are very bullish, and they are mostly unwilling to offer prices for forward contracts, while they are intending to search for spot goods, so prices are rising higher and higher. However, according to yesterday's East Asian exchange calculations, the difference with the current market is widening. It is observed that cargo prices will not ease for the time being, and new high prices are likely to emerge in the future.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Department Protects Existing Labor-Management Contracts</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the Press Workers' Union Was Instructed to Comply</p>
<p>▲ and Ordered to Withdraw Illegal Advertisements</p>
<p>The local press workers, with respect to all prior labor-management contracts agreed upon by the old labor union before it was reorganized, expressed a lack of explicit guarantees, and were unwilling to comply with the reorganization order, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee has now, in response to a formal request from the workers' union for explicit guarantees, issued the following directive: "Having reviewed the submission, it is hereby clarified that all collective agreements previously entered into between the various industry unions in this municipality and their respective management have not been explicitly rescinded during the current period of reorganization and rectification, and should therefore remain in full force and effect. Should any management deliberately violate these agreements, this Party will provide protection. The said union, having failed to clearly understand this, has instead dared to convene a delegates' conference and issue declarations expressing opposition without authorization, which is highly inappropriate. The union is hereby immediately instructed to comply, and must not disobey or obstruct the reorganization plan of this committee. The union is further directed to withdraw all declarations and advertisements published in the press by the date of this document, in order to correct public opinion. Should the union dare to violate these instructions, it will be held strictly accountable without leniency. This directive is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3>Various Postal Workers' Unions Uphold Original Organizations</h3>
<p>▲ Joint Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, together with postal workers' unions from various locations, in upholding the original organization of the union, jointly declares: We respectfully inform all elders and people from all walks of life across the country that since our postal workers, following the Three Principles of the People, have strived for the National Revolution, ten years have passed. Especially in the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], the revolutionary army and our postal workers shed blood fighting warlords, sacrificing themselves for the Party and the nation, which we still regard as the highest honor. Our efforts since then have not ceased. The reason why our postal workers have such a heroic history is due to the leadership of our postal workers' union. The leaders are all loyal members of our Party, adhering to the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, risking their lives in a desperate battle against reactionary forces. And our entire body of postal workers has followed and supported them, with one heart and one mind, creating this glorious history. Therefore, in the National Revolution, we have made indelible contributions, and in politics, we have made great contributions. For example, in opposing the Sino-American Aviation Contract, which humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty, our arguments were just and reasonable, and the whole country agreed. This new unequal treaty was modified due to the opposition of postal workers' unions in various places. In other matters, such as assisting the government in recovering postal rights, abolishing clerical staff and assistants who had not passed examinations, and opposing the establishment of a separate Savings and Remittance Bureau, we spared no effort in dealing with those who conspired to undermine the postal system for their own selfish desires. The postal service, which our country has painstakingly managed for more than thirty years, has not gone bankrupt. Anyone who cares about the postal service knows this. Postal workers under the leadership of postal workers' unions in various places, recalling the difficulties of the revolutionary unification and the challenges of establishing the postal service, are fortunate to be able to strengthen their original unity and engage in the new construction of the future. The development of our country's postal service will not be difficult to surpass Europe and the United States. Unexpectedly, news has arrived that the Central Government plans to order postal workers' unions across the country to reorganize according to the Trade Union Law. Although it is currently under consideration by the Central Government, it is like an arrow on the string, ready to be fired. Upon hearing this, postal workers' unions in various places believe that this move is the greatest crisis for the Chinese National Revolution in politics and postal services. The intention of the reorganization is inscrutable, but the intention to eliminate our postal workers' revolutionary unity is undeniable. What is even more painful is that the great postal service will inevitably become more and more dangerous and fall into an incurable path. Moreover, the late Premier Sun Yat-sen repeatedly instructed that the unity of workers must be guaranteed. If we violate this principle completely, would revolutionaries not be heartbroken? Alas, postal workers' unions in various places cannot but speak out now, declaring to the elders and people from all walks of life across the country: the past efforts of our postal workers' unions across the country are evident to everyone. If we now disregard everything and want to eliminate them, not only will the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven not allow it, but it will also be against the Party's program. For the sake of the overall revolutionary forces and the future development of the postal service, postal workers' unions across the country will inevitably lead postal workers across the country to maintain their original organizations and oppose any reorganization. Our life and death depend on it. Even with the greatest sacrifice, we will not hesitate. This declaration is made on February 10th by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Nanjing Postal Workers' Union, Zhenjiang Postal Workers' Union, Changzhou Postal Workers' Union, Wuxi Postal Workers' Union, Suzhou Postal Workers' Union, Xuzhou Postal Workers' Union, Jinan Postal Workers' Union, Yantai Postal Workers' Union, Qingdao Postal Workers' Union, Tianjin Postal Workers' Union, Beiping Postal Workers' Union, Baoding Postal Workers' Union, Changchun Postal Workers' Union, Harbin Postal Workers' Union, Jilin Postal Workers' Union, Taiyuan Postal Workers' Union, Kaifeng Postal Workers' Union, Yunnanfu Postal Workers' Union, Wuzhou Postal Workers' Union, Nanning Postal Workers' Union, Shantou Postal Workers' Union, Fuzhou Postal Workers' Union, Xiamen Postal Workers' Union, Wenzhou Postal Workers' Union, Chengdu Postal Workers' Union, Chongqing Postal Workers' Union, and Wanxian Postal Workers' Union, among others.</p>
<h3>Tang Shaoyi's Talk</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Youren to Go to Nanjing After the 13th</p>
<p>▲ Tang in Shanghai Waiting for Sun Ke and Others to Negotiate</p>
<p>▲ No Preconceived Ideas on Huangpu Port Construction</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Shaoyi, who has newly accepted the appointment as the magistrate of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. A reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Tang's residence yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM and had a conversation with him for about 20 minutes. Mr. Tang is now 71 years old and in good spirits. He said that he often eats vegetarian dishes and that the key to maintaining health for the elderly is to eat less.</p>
<p>This is very reasonable.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting with Chen Youren: Mr. Tang said, "Mr. Chen Youren came to Shanghai. I met him at a vegetarian restaurant this afternoon (yesterday) and had a pleasant conversation. I heard that Chen is scheduled to go to Nanjing after Friday (the 13th) of this week to pay respects at Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum and visit old friends in Nanjing."</p>
<p>▲ Departure Date for Guangdong: "Because the construction of Zhongshan County concerns my hometown, I am making an effort despite my old age. However, the members of the Zhongshan County Training and Political Committee are scattered in various places, making it difficult to convene them. Therefore, I plan to negotiate everything with Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Huichang, and other committee members in Shanghai. After there are substantial results, I will go to Guangdong to take office. Therefore, the departure date has not yet been determined. At that time, I may travel with Sun Ke. Mr. Wu Tiecheng is in urgent need of inspecting Party affairs in the Northeast and has no time to travel south."</p>
<p>▲ Zhongshan Port Construction: When the reporter asked about the advantages and disadvantages of the Zhongshan and Huangpu port construction issues, Mr. Tang replied, "I have not sent anyone to Zhongshan Port to measure it, so I have no way to judge it, and I have no preconceived ideas. Huangpu is a river port, and the cost and labor of building a port there would be considerable. Zhongshan Port is a sea port and is more convenient. When the British first came to China, they landed at Jinxingmen in Zhongshan Port. Afterwards, ships carrying opium and raw opium soil were anchored there."</p>
<p>▲ Views on the Guangxi Situation: On the Guangxi situation, which has been largely resolved, achieving the principle of Guangxi people governing Guangxi, Mr. Tang's view is: "It is our sincere hope that Guangxi people govern Guangxi. However, Guangxi Province itself has a financial deficit, which Guangdong has always assisted. Therefore, during the Qing Dynasty, a Governor-General of Liangguang [Guangdong and Guangxi] was established, using Guangdong's financial surplus to compensate for Guangxi's deficiencies, which was called 'subsidy.' This is like Hubei helping Hunan and Shaanxi helping Gansu. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the word 'cooperation,' based on the spirit of mutual assistance, to seek the development of Guangdong and Guangxi. Otherwise, Guangxi will be unable to provide for itself and will have to expand outwards, seizing territory, and the chaos will never end."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Prevents Meningitis</h3>
<p>▲ Deng Zhende and the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>▲ Agreed on Five Preventive Measures</p>
<p>Recently, an acute infectious disease, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, has been discovered near the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line in Haining and other places, which is likely to spread. After receiving this report, Deng Zhende, the Chief Medical Officer of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, immediately purchased meningitis vaccine and ordered nurses to rush to make gauze masks, which were distributed to clinics along the line for application. At the same time, he drafted six preventive measures: (1) Purchase meningitis vaccine and distribute it to clinics for railway employees and their families to increase their internal resistance; (2) Make and distribute gauze masks to staff working on trains and in epidemic areas for prevention; (3) Print 5,000 copies of a simple pamphlet on meningitis for distribution to various places for publicity; (4) Train personnel to assist health inspectors and medical officers in various clinics in handling epidemic prevention matters; (5) Cooperate with other local epidemic prevention agencies for joint prevention; (6) If the epidemic tends to expand and the medical officers in various clinics are insufficient, select and dispatch medical officers from Beijing-Shanghai to assist, and the Chief Medical Officer will personally preside over the matter. These measures have been implemented by order of the bureau. Chief Medical Officer Deng also recently met with Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Ministry of Interior's Health Department, in Hangzhou to discuss cooperation measures for epidemic prevention in transportation with the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department. Five measures were immediately agreed upon: (1) Inject preventive needles; (2) All staff serving on trains must wear masks; (3) Assign township officials and health inspectors to stations such as Changan, Xiashi, and Xucun to inspect passengers and establish temporary epidemic prevention stations; (5) Post propaganda prevention pictures and texts and distribute leaflets in trains. Director Liu and Chief Medical Officer Deng have already returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that since the railway bureau and the Zhejiang Provincial Government have cooperated in the prevention and control of this epidemic, the epidemic has been greatly reduced. Railway employees and passengers have not experienced the above-mentioned epidemic, and it is hoped that it will not spread to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Sino-Japanese Trade Volume</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Goods Imported to China Increased by Half Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Commercial Counselor's Office, the total Sino-Japanese trade volume last year was worth 677 million Japanese yen. Among them, Japanese goods imported to China were worth 399 million Japanese yen, exceeding the value of Chinese goods exported to Japan by 121 million Japanese yen (approximately 200 million Chinese currency). This excess amount, from China's perspective, is an import surplus, which accounts for one-half of the total value of Chinese goods exported to Japan. Compared with the total value of Japanese goods imported to China, it also accounts for one-third. Compared with the previous year, the value of Japanese goods imported to China increased by 130 million Japanese yen, and the import surplus also increased by 42 million Japanese yen. This shows that China purchased half more Japanese goods last year than the previous year. The total value of Japan's entire foreign trade was 3,198 million Japanese yen, of which exports accounted for 1,158 million Japanese yen, resulting in an import surplus of 161 million Japanese yen. If there were no Sino-Japanese trade to supplement it, its import surplus would increase by another three-quarters. This shows the importance of Sino-Japanese trade in Japan's foreign trade. Compared with the previous year, the export value decreased by 69.9 million Japanese yen, and the import surplus decreased by 9 million Japanese yen. However, upon examination, the reason is due to the decline in prices. In terms of quantity, there does not seem to be a significant reduction.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Held a Business Tax Research Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ It Was Decided That the Principle of Taxing Employment Should Be Adopted</p>
<p>▲ Tax Rate According to the Outline Promulgated by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Business Tax Research Committee specially formed by the City Chamber of Commerce held its first committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Eight specialized committee members, including Wang Yansong, Fang Jiaobo, Luo Qinghua, Shao Baoxing, Chen Songyuan, Zhuang Meitang, Ma Jiliang, and Cheng Youfu, were present. Wang Yansong was elected chairman. After performing the formalities, Secretary Yan Esheng reported in detail on (1) the "Outline for the Collection of Business Tax" and supplementary measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan; (2) the "Measures for the Collection of Business Tax" and tax rates proposed by the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, E, Fujian, and Anhui; (3) the situation of the business tax to be implemented in this city; (4) the opinions of various industries, such as the book, money, cosmetics, and candle industries, on the business tax; and (5) the proposals of the tax rules research committees of various industries. After discussion among the committee members, the following resolutions were made: (1) The business tax should be based on the principle of taxing employment, that is, in the goods sales industry, only the types of business should be distinguished, and the industry should be the unit, not the goods, so as not to repeat the mistakes of likin and the department store tax; (2) The tax rate should be based on the outline promulgated by the Executive Yuan as the standard, and if there is any excess, it should be strictly corrected; (3) The measures may be handled by referring to the measures stipulated by Anhui Province; (4) Chinese concessions and foreign concessions, Chinese and foreign stores, should be treated equally without bias; (5) Fang Jiaobo, Wang Yansong, and Luo Qinghua were selected as committee members to review the business tax collection regulations and tax rates proposed by the city; (6) Pass the motions and express opinions as much as possible for adoption. In addition, the three committee members who were appointed to review also scheduled a review meeting at 1:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Submits Opinions on Business Tax Again</h3>
<p>▲ Please Correct the Mistakes of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<p>▲ Can be Handled by Referring to the Measures of Anhui Province</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: Nanjing Ministry of Finance, respectfully notified. On the 7th of this month, we received a letter from the Tax Rules Committee of various industries in this city, requesting that the Ministry of Finance be re-telegraphed to collect business tax based on employment, not on the classification of goods, and to follow the measures proposed by Anhui Province to avoid malpractices. It was reported that the Ministry had already issued an order to various provinces to correct the collection of business tax based on employment and not on the classification of goods. However, upon reading the tax rates proposed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the classification therein does classify based on goods, such as sea cucumbers, swallow nests, ham, and sugar, which all belong to the scope of the southern goods industry. Forcibly analyzing them and taxing them separately violates the Ministry's order. We request that when the two provinces submit the business tax regulations for filing, each one be instructed to correct them. As for the two provinces levying a high tax of more than two per thousand on luxury goods, the so-called luxury goods include tea, lacquer, copper and tin, preserved meat, dried fish, pigments, candles, soap, nitrate, broken hair and bones, fan industry, and egg industry, almost without exception. Such an unlimited imposition is appalling. Moreover, Article 7 of the supplementary measures issued this time stipulates that various businesses, regardless of whether they operate in local or foreign goods, should be taxed at the same tax rate. However, the sales tax rates proposed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces still separately tax local and foreign goods such as paper, cloth, and medicine, which clearly violates the measures promulgated by the Ministry. We request that they be corrected separately. As for the request of the council to follow the Anhui Province measures, except for industries necessary for people's lives, which should be reduced as much as possible, the rest should be taxed at two per thousand. From a financial point of view, this is also reasonable. The likin of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was transferred to the central government as early as 1927, and the central government allocated land tax to compensate. The loss suffered by the two provinces this time was only 20% of the likin surtax. According to the report of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Finance Departments at the Ministry of Finance meeting in 1928, the likin revenue of Zhejiang Province did not exceed 6 million, and Jiangsu Province was only 7.26 million. Calculated at 20% of the surtax, the loss suffered by the two provinces each year is only 1.3-1.4 million. Even if the Anhui Province measures are followed, and the tax is uniformly levied at two per thousand, the commercial situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should be better than that in Anhui Province. Using this to offset the 20% surtax loss should be more than sufficient. It is not permissible to rely on Article 4 of the General Outline, which states that luxury goods and those that should be banned are not subject to this limit, to make unlimited excuses to obtain profits. Moreover, the so-called businesses that should be banned are not without this situation in special businesses. However, the supplementary measures have a limit that the capital amount should not exceed 20 per thousand. Taxing based on capital amount and taxing based on turnover are clearly disproportionate. The highest amount of the standard proposed by the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to levy business tax is the same as 20 per thousand, which is obviously unfair. This is especially what we must pray for the Ministry to pay close attention to and correct. The above is clearly stated, please adopt it, and instruct it to be followed for the public convenience.</p>
<h3>Request for Reduction of Business Tax Rates</h3>
<p>▲Cotton Cloth Industry: The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Association sent a letter yesterday to the tax rule research committee of various trade associations, stating: "Esteemed members, we have recently read in the newspapers that your association has addressed various parties regarding the business tax issue, and your statements have been insightful and beneficial to the industry. We are deeply impressed and respectful. However, we have a suggestion: Our industry, in addition to dealing in domestically produced cotton cloth, also occasionally deals in foreign cloth. In the draft business tax regulations formulated by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments, cotton weaving is taxed at 2 per mille, while foreign cloth is taxed at 15 per mille (Zhejiang) or 20 per mille (Jiangsu). This not only violates the Ministry's established guidelines but also goes against the democratic intent. Merchants and people have just celebrated the abolition of the Likin tax and are now facing heavy taxes again, which is unbearable. Therefore, we specifically raise the following points for your association's consideration: (1) The intention of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments in formulating this tax rule must be that foreign cloth is an imported item and should be restricted, hence the heavy tax to avoid hindering domestic goods. However, cloth is necessary for making clothes, and clothing is the primary necessity for residents. People cannot live without clothing, nor can they live without cloth. Our country's industry is declining, and production is lagging. The cloth produced domestically each year only accounts for 20% of the total needed, which is far from meeting the needs of the entire nation. The remaining 80% relies on foreign goods. This does not imply restriction. This is evident from the customs trade records, where foreign cloth consistently ranks first in import volume. The government has already obtained substantial tax revenue from this, and the burden on our people is already considerable. If a heavy business tax is imposed again, it will mean that ordinary people will not be able to afford enough cloth for clothing throughout the year, and those struggling to make ends meet will be everywhere. This is not what the government desires for merchants and people, nor is it the original intention of the government's determination to abolish the Likin tax. Therefore, it is inappropriate to increase the business tax on foreign cloth because it harms the livelihood of ordinary people. (2) According to tax regulations, raw materials and goods needed by the country should have their tax rates reduced or even eliminated to encourage trade. For example, in our country's newly revised customs tax regulations, paper is urgently needed, so the tax is not only not increased but reduced. The increase on metals is minimal, and foreign cloth is only increased by 2.5%, which is lower than other consumer goods, decorative items, and luxury goods. However, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments do not consider the hardships of merchants, do not consult public opinion, and even refuse to make adjustments. They disregard common tax regulations, so it is no wonder that opposition is rampant. Moreover, the business tax is based on the industry, not the goods. There is a distinction between domestic and foreign cloth in goods, but there is no distinction between domestic and foreign cloth in the industry. All are collectively called the cloth industry. How can they be forcibly divided? The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have listed cotton weaving (which naturally includes cotton cloth) at 2 per mille, and foreign cloth (foreign cloth and wool, in fact, are completely separate industries) at 15 per mille and 20 per mille. This division is inappropriate and violates Article 7 of the supplementary measures to the Ministry's established guidelines: 'All businesses, regardless of whether they deal in domestic or foreign goods, shall be taxed at the same rate.' The selling price of domestically produced cotton cloth can be cheaper than foreign cloth after the increase in customs duties. If we can strive for excellence and produce as much as possible, we can replace foreign cloth. Therefore, in this era when the Chinese people fully need foreign cloth, there is no hindrance to domestic goods. Therefore, it is inappropriate to increase the business tax on foreign cloth to reduce the burden on ordinary people. Currently, the business tax in our city is being discussed and formulated. If it is not handled properly, it will easily become an excessive tax. If it hinders progress, and we then try to remedy it, it will not only fail to uphold the law but also risk losing credibility. Moreover, those in our industry who also deal in foreign cloth have very thin profits and are already struggling to survive due to the impact of the gold being valuable and silver being cheap. If a heavy tax is imposed, they will be on the verge of bankruptcy, and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers will be completely cut off. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but feel frightened. Recently, we saw a statement by Chairman Wang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying that the Municipal Finance Committee is now asking various industries to submit their tax rate opinions for discussion. After the draft is formulated, it will be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for discussion by representatives of various industries, and then the Finance Bureau will report it to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. This shows the authorities' intention to consult widely and proceed with caution. Your letter also expresses opinions for selection. Therefore, we express our sincere feelings and respectfully request that you forward them to the Municipal Government Finance Bureau and the Finance Committee for their consideration. We hope that they will specially reduce the business tax rate for our industry to a maximum of 2 per mille to maintain the livelihood of the people and meet their expectations. This is our earnest plea."</p>
<p>▲Fur Industry: The Shanghai Fur Trade Association convened a meeting of its members last month to discuss the business tax issue. They unanimously advocated for a reduction in tax rates to alleviate the hardships of merchants and submitted a detailed statement to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward it to the National Government Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government for review. The original letter is as follows: "We respectfully submit that we heard that your association has requested a reduction in the principles for revising the business tax regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and we are deeply grateful. After collective discussion, we believe that the business tax is related to local revenue, and all merchants and people should fulfill their tax obligations. We dare not deny it outright. However, if the tax rate is too high and unbearable, we must speak out. We believe that fur is a special product of our country and is made by our own people. Those who invest and operate in this industry are also Chinese. According to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce's regulations on national product standards, it belongs to the first-class national product. In recent years, machine-made leather has been imported from abroad, increasing year by year. Our fur industry has been selling at low profits to resist this, and we already feel exhausted. Moreover, imported wool is also flooding the market, and profits are flowing abroad. What can we do? We can only rely on domestic fur products to resist. However, if we disregard this and impose heavy tax rates, what can we imagine for the future? To cultivate production for the country and to relieve the vitality of merchants and people, the tax rate should be reduced. This is the first reason. Fur is made by hard labor. Just take Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces as an example. There are already hundreds of thousands of leather-making laborers. In the northern provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Sichuan, every family raises livestock and makes leather for a living. The laborers are hundreds of times more numerous than in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Once the tax rate suddenly increases, sales will stagnate. This will directly harm merchants and indirectly put the fur industry into bankruptcy and the leather-making workers to death. To preserve the remaining space for indigenous industries and to maintain the livelihoods of hard-working laborers, the tax rate should be reduced. This is the second reason. Among the four necessities of life, clothing is the most important. Fur is the main raw material for clothing and is by no means comparable to luxury goods. In the cold north, whether rich or poor, young or old, everyone needs a fur coat. When our national army marched north last year, from the army commander to the soldiers, everyone made fur products for warmth. This is a clear example. The climate in the south is warmer, but there are also cold days in winter when fur is necessary. Fur is a necessity for the general public and is related to the economy of the general public. Once the tax rate is heavily levied, the price of goods will inevitably increase. Those who have it may be able to sustain themselves, but what about the poor? To take care of the livelihood of the general public, the tax rate should be reduced. This is the third reason. Based on the above three major reasons, we suggest that the central government understand the situation below and make special changes. The originally set business tax rate for fur products should be reduced to a maximum of 2 per mille. This is to cultivate national production and relieve the livelihoods of merchants and people. This is also to preserve the remaining space for our indigenous industries, maintain the livelihoods of hard-working laborers, and take care of the livelihood of the general public. Correspondingly, we respectfully submit a letter stating the reasons for requesting a special reduction in the business tax rate for fur products. We earnestly request your association to investigate, vigorously advocate, and promptly send a telegram to forward it to the central government."</p>
<p>▲Paint Industry: The Paint Trade Association believes that the business tax rates set by Jiangsu Province for the sandalwood and rosewood industry and the Western-style furniture industry are too high and unbearable. Therefore, on the 7th, they sent a telegram to the authorities, requesting a reduction. The original text reads: "To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance Central Party Department Shanghai Municipal Government: We believe that the government has clearly ordered the abolition of the Likin tax and is preparing to implement the business tax, which will soon be implemented. We have read in the newspapers that Jiangsu Province has promulgated regulations for the collection of business tax. The tax rate for goods and awards industries, for the sandalwood and rosewood industry and the Western-style furniture industry, is set at 20 per mille, which exceeds the standard of at most 2 per mille stipulated in Article 4 of the Executive Yuan's promulgated outline. This contradicts the Yuan's order. Paint is completely applied to various wood materials and equipment, whether it is sandalwood, rosewood, or pine. The various Chinese and Western-style furniture made of wood is entirely made of domestic materials and is completely necessary for household use. It cannot be compared to luxury goods. Rosewood furniture is the same as the bamboo, wood, rattan, and palm industry and is a national product manufactured by hand. The tax should not exceed 2 per mille. The raw materials for bamboo, wood, rattan, and palm are only taxed at 2 per mille, while the raw materials for sandalwood and rosewood are taxed ten times more. The provincial government has not strictly distinguished between luxury goods and daily necessities, only considering tax revenue as the goal. This does not seem to be the original intention of the central government to promote handicrafts and protect the livelihoods of ordinary people. Our association has a patriotic and skilled heart and will not lag behind others. We should fulfill our obligations to the best of our ability. The business tax regulations promulgated by the provincial government this time for the sandalwood, rosewood, and Western-style furniture industry should refer to the Yuan's order and should not be excessive, causing a huge impact on the market stores and creating unprecedented panic. Our association has always felt the pain and is unable to remain silent. Therefore, we request that you uphold justice and apply the light tax of no more than 2 per mille for the sandalwood, rosewood, and Western-style furniture industry to maintain their livelihoods. We are extremely anxious to submit this." Shanghai Paint Trade Association, Yu.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Industries in Ningbo Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Request to Jointly Strive for Business Tax Rates</p>
<p>Ningbo Rice Industry, Medicine Store, Sugar and North Industry, Wood Industry, Seafood and Noodle Industry, Fresh Goods Industry, Silk and Cloth Industry, Board and Wood Industry, Min-Guang Trade, Fruit and Local Goods Industry, Foreign Sundries Industry, Industry, Bank and Transportation Industry, Industry, Cattle Bone Industry, Tobacco Industry, and other fifteen trade associations specially sent representative Qi Yungui to Shanghai to strive for lower business tax rates. It is reported that Qi has gone to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to make contact and proceed together. The letter from the trade association to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is recorded below: "We have recently read in the newspapers that your association considers the business regulations to be繁苛 and is striving through telegrams to make an appeal on behalf of the people.海同欽. We believe that the people have the obligation to pay taxes, and the principle of tax rate is equality. This is generally recognized. This time, the business tax is being implemented in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces as a trial area. Regardless of the burden of the tax regulations and the great pain to the people, the tax standard is based on the proportion of goods. There are existing one per thousand and ten per thousand, which differ by more than multiples. This not only violates the spirit of equality, but also hides the old precedent of Likin tax. Alas, how can our merchants and people bear it? We have always admired your association as the leading commercial group in the country. The words of benevolent people are very beneficial.沪 接 坏 休戚与共. After a meeting, our colleagues decided that the current business tax regulations need to be reduced and revised. We specially recommend representative Qi Jun Yungui to go to your office and ask for guidance so that we can proceed together."</p>
<h3>Silk and Cocoon Industry Requests Exemption from Special Tax</h3>
<p>▲Submission to the Central Government</p>
<p>Huang Jinshen, Chairman of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk and Cocoon General Office, submitted a document to the National Government Legislative Yuan Ministry of Finance, stating: "Submission for a request to exempt silk and cocoons from special tax in order to encourage production and maintain the silk industry. We believe that silk has long been a special product of our country and has enjoyed a great reputation in the European and American markets. The foreign trade of Chinese industry and commerce also regards silk as a major commodity for recovering profits and relieving people's livelihoods. It is especially important in the real economy. Since Italy and Japan have revived their silk industries and made progress year by year, and have received national protection and assistance, they have become formidable rivals to Chinese silk. In recent years, Japan's output has exceeded ours by more than ten times, causing European and American silk markets to be manipulated by them. Chinese silk exports have been relatively disadvantaged. If there is no cooperation between the government and the public to resist, the crisis will become increasingly urgent. We, Jinshen, etc., operate in the silk and cocoon industry and are closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. We have experienced the hardships of merchants and the people for a long time. The most important thing at present is to first request the government to exempt silk and cocoons from special tax in order to maintain the silk industry. Silk is fundamentally related to agriculture and industry, and the current crisis is incomparable to other industries. Support it and it will stand, suppress it and it will fall. Life and death, prosperity and decline, are at stake. We respectfully present the following points to our government: (1) The most prosperous cocoon areas in our country are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In recent years, due to the increase in silk reeling machines, the output has not increased. Supply cannot meet demand. Manufacturers and cocoon merchants are vying to purchase, so cocoon prices are high and farmers' profits are relatively slow. The output is not reduced. However, from 上的 to now, foreign sales have been sluggish and silk prices have fallen daily. Manufacturers have suffered losses and are even waiting for rescue. Observing the world situation, there is currently Japanese silk manipulation and the intrusion of artificial silk. Chinese silk is difficult to develop suddenly. In the future, the purchase of fresh cocoons will inevitably learn from the past and tighten cocoon prices to take into account costs. When cocoon prices fall, farmers will have no profit to make. According to economic principles, this will inevitably cause farmers to abandon sericulture, and the output will be invisibly reduced sharply. Crisis is lurking, and we are deeply worried. We can only look to the government to exempt special taxes in order to encourage silkworm breeding and maintain the inherent output. The special tax is directly collected from silk and cocoon merchants, and indirectly from farmers. If the burden on merchants and people is slightly lighter, the cocoon price will increase, and farmers will benefit from it. This will arouse interest in silkworm breeding and increase the amount of cocoons. (2) In recent years, the silk industry has declined, and 90% of manufacturers have suffered losses. They regard the silk industry as a dangerous path. There are currently only more than 200 factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If the burden is heavy and Japanese silk is sold competitively, silk merchants will inevitably stop their business and change their plans. The livelihoods of millions of workers will be eliminated in large numbers. Farmers' production is closely related to factories. The number of silk factories is reduced, and silk cocoons are unsalable. As a result, it will hinder the livelihoods of farmers and workers and still reduce the amount of cocoons invisibly. If we are exempted from special tax to maintain factories and increase the number of factories, we can increase the quantity of raw silk for export so as not to confine ourselves to 60,000 to 70,000 packages each year. (3) Paying taxes is the obligation that people should fulfill, and it is also a necessary income for the public. The tax rules of all countries in the world are based on supporting domestic production. Foreign goods are imported with heavy taxes, and domestic goods are exported with special tax exemptions, so the real economy can be developed. The Japanese government has long been completely exempt from taxes on both silk and cocoons, overwhelming Chinese silk. The goal has been achieved, and it still does not hesitate to make great sacrifices. In addition to tax exemption, it also supports silk merchants to engage in competitive sales. Now, Chinese silk exports are inferior to Japanese silk, and they are burdened with new taxes. For example, A and B are racing. A is strong and lightly equipped, while B is weak and burdened with heavy weights. Before it reaches its destination, it will be left behind. If we want to compete with Japanese silk exports in the European and American markets, we can only look to the government for special assistance to make it lightly equipped and exempt from special tax to promote its progress. We have reviewed that our government promulgated uniform tax regulations, and goods that have paid uniform tax will be refunded when exported. The plan to promote domestic goods in the resolution on abolishing Likin tax stipulates that all machine-made domestic goods transported and sold overseas shall be exempt from all taxes and Likin to promote sales. This shows that the government subsidizes the real economy and is well-intentioned. The raw silk industry is completely improved by machinery and is purely sold to Europe and the United States. It is the largest export industry. Although it belongs to the special tax category, it is completely in line with the tax exemption method. After the abolition of Likin tax, we should sort out various tax rules and revise them separately. We should conduct detailed assessments. We, Jinshen, etc., know the silk industry very well and have been invaded for a long time. According to the recent crisis, the progress and decline of silkworms, the surplus and deficit of factories, and the future are very important. The only way to save it is to submit a request to the government to exempt silk and cocoons from special tax in order to encourage silkworm breeding, miscellaneous funds to call, and to save factories from shrinking so that they can compete in the European and American markets and protect the status of Chinese silk. We hope that the Executive Yuan (Ministry) will approve this and benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. We are very eager to wait for the issuance of the order." Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk and Cocoon General Office Committee Huang Jinshen and all the others listed their names and bowed.</p>

<h3>Guangji Steamer Captures Gangsters Mixed with Taiwanese Bandits</h3>
<p>▲Bandit weapons are all escorted to the Water Police Department</p>
<p>▲China Merchants Bureau Can Take Appropriate Measures</p>
<p>▲Hakka Express Trust and Sincerity</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau's Guangji steamer, coming from Wenzhou to Shanghai, searched for military weapons in transit and returned to Ou for re-examination. Zeng Zhi's newspaper, now heard that the ship passed through Wenzhou military and police detailed investigation, without alarming a guest or spending a bullet, the bandits have been completely captured, the journey is safe, the merchants are happy, and will continue to hear, divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Returning to Wenzhou for Re-examination After the Guangji steamer was searched by the aviation police at the mountain bay in Wenzhou and 15 pistols were confiscated, it reported to Shanghai by telegram and returned for re-examination. At the same time, it informed the Wenzhou Branch by radio that military police would be prepared to board the ship for re-search when the ship arrived. Zhang, director of Wenzhou, notified the local garrison and the Chao Wu warship of the Water Police Overseas Hall to be on alert on the sea surface, and sent police to assist in the investigation. When the ship arrived at Wenzhou Port, passengers were forbidden to go up and down. Armed military police boarded the ship to question passengers, and none of the bandits mixed in the ship were missed.</p>
<p>▲Captured Taiwanese Bandits When the naval and land military police boarded the ship to interrogate, the Chao Wu warship water police found more than a dozen people with suspicious appearances among the passengers, and took them for interrogation one by one. After strict interrogation by the water police, the bandits could not deny it and confessed that they were Taiwanese bandits. The confiscated pistols were indeed carried by the bandits who mixed into the ship with ulterior motives. After the interrogation was clear and definite, each bandit was handcuffed by the water police and escorted to the warship and sent to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>▲Warship Escort Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau received another telegram from Guangji, stating that the captured Taiwanese bandits and military weapons had been detained and sent to the Overseas Hall for interrogation.

<h3>Jiangda Steamer After Being Hit, Towed Out of Shallow Waters Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Bow Crashed and Keel Broken</p>
<p>▲ Passengers and Cargo Unharmed, Departing for Shanghai the Same Day</p>
<p>The Jiangda Steamer of the China Merchants Bureau, damaged after being hit by a Taikoo iron barge, has been reported in this newspaper. The latest news, heard yesterday, is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ Accident at Wujiang: On the night of the 6th of this month, the Jiangda Steamer was heading downriver to Shanghai. A Taikoo SB barge, fully loaded with kerosene, was heading to Hankou. When the Jiangda Steamer reached the Wujiang area near Dashengguan, it was violently struck by the barge. Due to the severe impact, the Jiangda also ran aground on Rosina Rock in the nearby Wujiang River. The Nanjing branch sent the Tunan to tow it, and after a day, it was finally pulled out of the shallows.</p>
<p>▲ Passengers Transferred to the Jing: As the Tunan's towing efforts were ineffective, the passengers from Hankou to Shanghai on the Jiangda Steamer were first transferred to the Tunan. It departed on the 8th and arrived in Nanjing at around 10 PM. All passengers, along with their luggage and belongings, were safe. Yesterday, some of them had already transferred to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Two Vessels Locked Together: The Taikoo iron barge was very large and heavily laden. When it collided with the Jiangda, the impact was so forceful that the barge's bow wing locked onto the bow of the Jiangda. It was impossible to separate them immediately. According to Captain Feng's report, the bow of the barge had crashed into the bow of the Jiangda, preventing it from moving backward. It was necessary to send ironworkers to hammer them apart. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau telegraphed the Nanjing branch, ordering them to send ironworkers and technicians with tools to knock them apart. It is expected that they will be separated today.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangda Damage: After the Jiangda Steamer was hit, the captain investigated and reported to Shanghai via telegram that the keel of the ship was broken, resulting in significant damage. Fortunately, the damage to the bow was above the waterline, so there was no damage to the cargo. However, repairs will require a large sum of money. The issue of responsibility will be investigated, and negotiations will be conducted with Taikoo.</p>
<p>▲ Towed Out of Shallow Waters: Yesterday afternoon, another telegram was received from Nanjing, stating that the Jiangda Steamer and the Taikoo barge, which had run aground, had been towed out of the shallows by the Tunan. After the bow is detached, it can be sailed back to Shanghai to unload the cargo and undergo major repairs in the dock.</p>
<h3>Ban on Gasoline-Powered Vessels Under 100 Tons</h3>
<p>▲ Customs Authorities Agree to a Three-Month Extension</p>
<p>▲ Results of Japanese Consulate's Negotiations with Customs</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs previously received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to prohibit gasoline-powered boats and electric boats under [a] tons from entering and exiting ports to avoid danger and prevent tax evasion. After receiving the order, the Jianghai Customs had already informed Chinese and foreign shipping companies. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, believing that the customs' ban on vessels under 100 tons would greatly affect the country's fishing industry, specially sent a vice-consul to negotiate with the Customs Commissioner, requesting a modified approach. According to news from the Japanese Consulate yesterday, the negotiations have concluded. The Jianghai Customs authorities have agreed to a three-month extension, at which time the ban will be re-implemented.</p>
<h3>Chen Xizeng, Newly Appointed Head of Municipal Public Security Bureau, to Take Office Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Housheng Cotton Mill Not Transferred to Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>▲ Earnest Statement to the Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association's Textile Times, No. 768, carried news of the Housheng Cotton Mill being sold to Japanese merchants after its closure. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs immediately ordered the mill to submit a clear reply, which read (excerpted above): "At a time when the Municipal Government is promoting domestic goods, and with gold being expensive and silver cheap, this is an excellent opportunity for domestic goods manufacturers. The manufacturer should maintain the established situation with patriotic zeal. Even if it is absolutely necessary to sell, it should be limited to domestic manufacturers. Is there any truth to the aforementioned matter? You are ordered to submit a detailed reply within ten days of receipt of this document. Do not sign any contracts before approval has been granted." Subsequently, Li Rongren, the manager of the mill, replied (excerpted above): "Our company has suffered some losses due to the impact of expensive gold. We are temporarily closing down and reorganizing everything at the end of the year. The rumor of selling to Japanese merchants is just that, a rumor. It is absolutely untrue. The recently published Textile Times No. 770, page 576, of the Cotton Mill Association has corrected the record. We are submitting this report for your review."</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society's Publicity Regarding Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>▲ Sends Letters to All Sectors to Request Attention</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that opium will be exclusively sold, attracting attention from all sides. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society yesterday specially sent letters to all anti-opium branches, anti-opium publicity groups, its constituent groups, and members. The letter reads as follows: "Recently, various parties have circulated rumors that the central anti-smoking authorities are abandoning the policy of complete prohibition and adopting an opium monopoly. Comrades from all sides have been informing each other, and this society has also followed the unanimous resolution and was the first to put forward a protest, which has been echoed by various organized groups and local branches via letters and telegrams. Now we have received a formal letter of denial from the Central Anti-Smoking Committee, which you have likely read in the newspapers. This is a matter of comfort to all of us. The National Anti-Opium Movement was created to oppose the disguised opium monopoly implemented by the former Beijing government. For the past six years, we have gathered comrades, created public opinion, and vehemently protested against the evil system of opium monopoly. On the one hand, we have suggested to the government to completely prohibit the opium policy. In the 17th year of the Republic, the national government adopted it and formed the Anti-Smoking Committee to show its determination to thoroughly ban smoking. The history of the establishment of the Anti-Smoking Committee is closely related to the opposition to the monopoly system, and there is no reason for an organization that opposes it to implement a system that it opposes. Moreover, many of the members of the society were enthusiastic about opposing opium monopoly in the past. Even if they are now members of the committee, they will not contradict themselves. This is the common sense of reason, and it is also the consensus of public opinion. However, although the ban still exists and the authorities deny the existence of a monopoly plan, in reality, rumors are rife. It is said that the authorities have entrusted a certain important customs adviser to draft an opium monopoly plan, modeled on the cigarette special tax method, which is estimated to collect about 80 to 100 million yuan in tobacco tax each year. This plan is entirely aimed at raising funds and runs counter to the prohibition policy promulgated by the national government. We hope it is inaccurate. Recently, we suddenly received a telegram from a Chinese overseas anti-tobacco group in Taiwan, stating that the Ministry of Finance recently specially dispatched Counselor Li Jihong, Xia Tingyao of the Customs Administration, along with follower Zhou Zhizhen and others, on January 17th, taking the Fujian Maru ship to Keelung, and then transferring by car to Taipei to visit Governor-General Baiji and the Director of Finance Bureau Aoyu, etc., to investigate the monopoly system, preparing to imitate this method. Local Chinese were extremely shocked, because this move is preparing for our country's opium monopoly. The Taiwan opium monopoly system has already caused the Chinese in Taiwan to suffer greatly. The government has not taken measures to remedy it, but instead plans to imitate it to implement it on the people, with激昂 emotions and deep dissatisfaction. It is found that Li Jihong was the person who handled the opium monopoly in the past. His intention to go to Taiwan may be related to the implementation of opium monopoly in the future. Moreover, those who have a deep relationship with the opium monopoly and who recently promoted the monopoly in the newspapers were officially appointed as members of the Anti-Smoking Committee on February 4. Based on the above facts, the implementation of the opium monopoly is already underway and will not be suspended due to the denial of the Anti-Smoking Committee. Opium monopoly is a kind of aggression policy implemented by the great powers in the colonies. The annual profits from poison are countless. For decades, the voices of opposition from all over our country have been constant, and the Anti-Smoking Committee has repeatedly protested. If we imitate it, or similar monopoly policies, and implement it on our compatriots, it is tantamount to treating the lives of our people as materials for raising funds, which is no different from the colonial government's treatment of our overseas Chinese. The Premier had long seen this, so his anti-drug instructions clearly stipulated that the opium business should absolutely not coexist with the National Government that had been given the power granted to people. Also, he said, 'Anyone who advocates that the law allows opium business, no matter how long, is an act of selling the country.' Now, some people ignore the Premier's instructions and openly violate the Kuomintang program and the explicit ban on smoking, and are carrying out the publicity and preparation of the opium monopoly. We should give it full attention and monitoring. The National Anti-Opium Movement, for the public sale implemented during the era of warlords in the former Beijing government, has made every effort to protest and has achieved victory. At this time, when the civil war is over and the political training has just begun, we should especially invigorate our perseverance and oppose it to the end, so that it will not be realized, leaving our people a glimmer of life and avoiding the extinction of the race. The ban on smoking is fortunate, and our country is fortunate."</p>
<h3>American Red Cross Seeks Contributions from the Chinese Red Cross</h3>
<p>The American Red Cross has read the English book "The Work of the Chinese Red Cross" written by Mr. Wang Peiyuan, Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross, and deeply admired it.

<h3>Verdict Announced in Qingyun Lane Demolition Appeal Case</h3>
<p>▲ Appeal Rejected</p>
<p>▲ Tenants Lose Again</p>
<p>The Qingyun Lane landlord, New Sassoon &amp; Co., previously hired more than 200 White Russians to forcibly demolish the houses there. The tenant, Miao She, believed that Xing Dingcheng, the company's comprador, was acting as an accomplice, and sued Xing in the Special District Court, requesting punishment. After investigation, it was determined that Xing was not involved and was declared innocent. Miao and others were dissatisfied and hired lawyers to appeal to the High Court. Xing also hired lawyers Shi Fuchang and Chen Zhongyin to defend him. After several court hearings and debates, the verdict was announced yesterday afternoon. Both parties and their lawyers were present. Judge Song convened a meeting and announced that the appeal was rejected. This is the second loss for the tenants.</p>
<h3>National Invention of Pocket Warmer</h3>
<p>Japanese merchants have recently invented pocket warmers to ward off the severe cold and maintain body temperature. The number of units sold in various Chinese ports is very large. Recently, a Chinese man, Sun Wenyong (Zhanfang), studied the structure of pocket warmers and the various refined coal fuels to recover funds leaked from China. He spent three months and succeeded. The style is very new, and the refined coal is durable and long-burning. The test results are better than Japanese goods, and the price is lower than imported products. Therefore, Chinese people are competing to buy them to promote domestic goods and prevent capital leakage. It is reported that the general manager's office is located at Qinchang Company, Qinyeli, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, and major pharmacies and department stores in various ports are selling them.</p>

<h3>Motor Garage on the President Hoover Ship</h3>
<p>The Dalae Steamship Company of this port recently received a report from its head office stating that the President Hoover has a motor garage installed, which can accommodate one hundred cars. All passenger cars can drive directly ashore for sightseeing, without the need to use mechanical or manual power. This ship travels between Little Luzon and New York, passing through the following ports: Havana, Cristobal, Balboa, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. The ship is 33,800 tons, travels at 21 nautical miles per hour, and has a capacity of 1,260 passengers in first, second, third, and fourth class cabins, and a crew of 300 sailors. This ship is scheduled to sail from New York in July this year and arrive in Shanghai in early September.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee of the Pen Society</h3>
<p>The Pen Society held a standing committee meeting at Xueyuan at noon on Sunday. Members and guests including Cai Jiemin, Zhang Xingyan, Cheng Yansheng, Xu Zhimo, Shao Xunmei, Zheng Zhenduo, Fu Yanchang, Fu Donghua, Liang Desuo, Zhang Ruogu, Zhao Jingshen, Mi Weiji, Sun Shihao, Zeng Jinke, Situ Bo, Ge Gongzhen, and Ms. Yu Xiuyun attended. Chairman Cai Jiemin presided over the meeting. During the meeting, Mr. Zhang Xingyan talked about the recent situation in the literary world of the Northeast, saying that the so-called intellectual class is still out of reach in the Northeast. As far as higher education is concerned, most of those in charge are from within the pass. Of the 170 professors, only a quarter are from outside the pass. There are many well-known scholars among the professors, who all feel the lack of freedom within the pass and go there. However, because the facilities outside the pass are naive, they often feel lonely and go elsewhere. But the academic style is very good, which is not comparable within the pass, because most of the students come from peasant families, landlords, or Manchu descendants, and less than 5% are from other provinces. The results are also remarkable, but they are slightly biased towards the old, and there is very little vernacular. They also like to make antithetical prose. However, there are students with new ideas, so the Northeast is standing at a crossroads and should be introduced into the right path. Mr. Cheng Yansheng talked about the success of the Turkish Revolution, saying that the relationship between ethnicity and religion is completely different from China's, which is purely political. Chinese people like to cite Turkish affairs, which is a great misunderstanding. Next, Mr. Ge Gongzhen reported that the World Pen Society will hold a meeting in the Netherlands in June this year, and has sent amendments to the articles of association to solicit opinions, and also reported on other meeting affairs. The meeting adjourned near 4:00 PM.</p>

They are finely printed, revealing the full brushstrokes and preserving the original essence. Each is a beautifully bound volume, and each page can be used freely. The first ten types are Chen Lutan's Thousand Character Classic, Shen Yulin's Palace Examination Record, Zhao Mengfu's Zhang Gong Stele, Yan Lugong's Eastern Calligraphy Eulogy, Chen Xiuyu's Chanpu Temple Record, Zheng Xiaoxu's Yiyi Record, Liu Gongquan's Xuanmi Pagoda, Tan Zhonglin's Siku Quanshu Pavilion Stele, Lu Runxiang's Reading Pleasure, and Qi Junzao's Chengzi Four Admonitions.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Reviews of Wang Yunwu's Dictionary</h3>
<p>The National Peiping Library Journal, dated April 25, 19, featured a review by "Ming" of the Wang Yunwu Dictionary published by the Shanghai Commercial Press. It stated that the book was compiled by Wang Yunwu based on his original Four-Corner Number Indexing Method. The beginning of the volume contains an explanation of the book's arrangement method, followed by the preface to the Four-Corner Number Indexing Method, the editorial guidelines, and the dictionary. The end of the volume contains 30 kinds of application forms, a table of specialized terms with English-Chinese comparison, and an index. The advantages and disadvantages of the Four-Corner Number Indexing Method have become a subject of discussion in the academic community and will not be discussed here. As for the novelty of the book's compilation, it must be considered unique among all previous Chinese dictionaries. The characters collected in the book are arranged using the Four-Corner Number. Each character is annotated with a homophone, and the four tones are also annotated when necessary. In addition, phonetic symbols and Roman alphabets are used for phonetic notation, and then the part of speech and meaning of the word are explained, and examples are given to prove it. Each single character is attached with a separate explanation of its meaning. The order of the single words is arranged according to the first two numbers of the second character. The form is similar to that of "The concise oxford Dictionary". Each page is accompanied by a simplified table of the Four-Corner Number Indexing Method, which is similar to the reading guide attached to the bottom of the first page of "WebsteresinternationalDict". All of these take the advantages of Western dictionaries, combining Kangxi Zidian and Ci Yuan, which is unprecedented by other Chinese dictionaries. Its impact on the compilation of future Chinese dictionaries will be not small. This book is originally intended for students below high school, and only the most common words are selected, but in fact it can be used by the general public. The whole book pays attention to simplicity and clarity. The only thing that the reporter thinks is that in addition to the Roman alphabet phonetic notation, it is also appropriate to adopt the International Phonetic Alphabet. In this way, the system will be more in line with the trend of the times, and the pronunciation will be more accurate, which is simpler and easier to understand than using only the Roman alphabet phonetic notation. Also, the first of the 30 forms attached is the Wang's original unified classification method of Chinese and foreign books. According to this method, the strengths and weaknesses are interdependent, and it is an unfinished work in academia. If it can be removed, it seems to be more than enough to show the author's humble and gentlemanly style.</p>
<h3>Mingxing to Screen "Human Hell" Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Mingxing Theater will begin screening "Human Hell" tomorrow (11th). This film is the work of the famous director Cecil B. DeMille. The whole film has sound dubbing and dialogue, with excellent interspersing depictions of prison life, and it is also very detailed.

<h3>Fire Alarm on Datong Road Last Night</h3>
<p>At 11:00 PM last night, a fire broke out at Yuanfengshun Cotton Shop on Datong Road, Zhabei, which was established by people from Yangzhou. The smoke was as thick as ink, piercing the roof and spreading to the neighboring Liu Yuantai Hat Shop. Fire brigades from the first, second, and third sections of Zhabei immediately rushed to the scene with leather belt vehicles to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 11:45 PM. It is estimated that two houses were burned down. As for the circumstances of the fire, the fire starter is on the run, and the details are unknown.</p>

<h3>Lin Weiqing and Wife Nearly Kidnapped by Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ Four People in a Car Returning Home</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Ambush Outside the Gate, Owner Unharmed</p>
<p>▲ Lin's Wife Kidnapped, Escapes En Route</p>
<p>▲ Watchman Suspected and Detained</p>
<p>Lin Weiqing, a Cantonese man engaged in construction, lives at 55 Beikai'er Road. At around 1:10 AM yesterday morning, Lin and his wife drove home in their own car number 3733 from outside. In addition to the couple, Lin's sister and her daughter were also in the car. Upon reaching the gate, the driver Chen Asan, according to his usual habit, pressed the horn to signal the watchman to open the gate. However, after several honks, the gate finally opened, and four bandits, who had been lying in wait outside the gate, rushed into the car. Fortunately, Weiqing was very alert and immediately got out of the car and ran into the house. The kidnappers drove Lin's sister, daughter, and the driver down, and the bandits drove away with Lin's wife. However, the driver of the kidnappers had poor driving skills. After driving, the car stopped from time to time. When they arrived at the intersection of Broadway Road and Minhang Road, the car stopped worriedly again. The four bandits were greatly flustered. Lin's wife then said to the bandits, "The gasoline has run out, this car cannot move forward参". The bandits looked at each other helplessly and had to abandon the car and flee. Lin's wife then got out of the car and used the telephone to notify the police. The Huishan police learned of this and immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to search for the bandits. The watchman, Mr. Wang, was suspected of delaying opening the door, so he was taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Huangpu Bridge Construction Plan</h3>
<p>▲Reasons for Initiation and Grand Plan for Developing Pudong</p>
<p>▲Pudong Inaugurates Long-Distance Bus Service</p>
<p>▲Connecting from Tangqiao to Pinghu</p>
<p>▲Established by Mainland Syndicate and Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>▲Capital Returns to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The initiation of the Huangpu River Bridge has recently garnered significant attention from the municipal government. However, there remains a lack of clear understanding regarding the initiators, leading to misunderstandings. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency visited Yao Jizhong, the initiator overseeing the project, yesterday. Yao is the brother-in-law of Zhang Jingjiang, a prominent figure in the National Government's Construction Commission, and has extensive experience in construction projects. He provided detailed information, which is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Initiation: Yao stated that the initiation began last year, with initial plans for building a bridge over the Yangtze River at Pukou, the capital. Later, considering the Shanghai and Pukou situations, it became clear that Shanghai was more suitable. The original plan was thus shifted to Shanghai, especially as the Shanghai Municipal Government had grand plans for developing a Greater Shanghai, with the development of Pudong already in the pipeline. Thus, it was believed that building a bridge over the Huangpu River would greatly contribute to the municipal government's grand project. Consequently, a proposal was drafted and actively pursued, and submitted to the municipal government for approval a month ago. This is a general overview of the previous preparations.</p>
<p>▲Developing Pudong: Initiating the bridge construction was the first step in the planned development. The ultimate goal is to develop the Pudong area. Pudong has vast land and abundant resources, but suffers in comparison to Shanghai across the river. Yao and others plan that after the completion of the Huangpu River Bridge as the first step, they will engage in transportation development in Pudong. Starting from Tangqiao town, the bridge base in Pudong, they will operate long-distance buses passing through Nanhui and Fengxian counties to Pinghu, connecting with the long-distance bus service to Hangzhou, which has already been established by the Zhejiang provincial government. In this way, once the Pudong transportation network is completed, Pudong's products can be transported extensively to Shanghai, greatly benefiting the people of both Pudong and Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Mainland Syndicate: Regarding the funding, it had already been planned out, with the Mainland Syndicate providing the capital. This syndicate has numerous loans with our national government. The syndicate's assets can readily raise one hundred million silver dollars. These investments in China are also motivated by a love for their homeland. Furthermore, the national government has incentive policies to welcome overseas Chinese to invest in China. Therefore, they are willing to invest substantial funds in their homeland. The initiation of the Huangpu River Bridge is merely one of the syndicate's investment projects.</p>
<p>▲Construction Date: Six months after approval from the municipal government, construction can officially begin. It is estimated that the entire project will take two years to complete. Although initiated by merchants, the project remains connected to the government. In the future, the construction will require the municipal government to send personnel to inspect and supervise the work, to ensure mutual cooperation and perfection.</p>
<p>▲Returning to the Municipal Government: Once the bridge is completed, merchants can freely enter and exit. However, to recoup the initiators' capital, a small toll will be charged, estimated at two or three copper coins, which will not exceed the current ferry fees. Once the collected revenue equals the invested amount, the initiators will relinquish the management rights of the bridge and donate it to the municipal government without any compensation. This way, the municipal government can complete this massive construction project without spending a penny. In the future, with the convenient transportation in Pudong, the municipal government can also gain considerable revenue.</p>
<p>▲Important Statement: Yao concluded that their efforts are genuinely aimed at developing Pudong and helping the municipal government complete the Greater Shanghai plan. The initiators do not own any land in Pudong, hoping to avoid unnecessary speculation. This matter can be investigated. As for the inner workings of the Mainland Syndicate, inquiries can be made to the relevant parties mentioned above. Regarding the municipal government's Greater Shanghai development plan, even if it benefits the public, the municipal government will still have to issue public bonds to secure funding, which will ultimately burden the citizens. However, with this significant contribution from the merchants, the local people will not face any additional burdens, and the debt rights will still belong to the municipal government. The plan is the best possible, and support should be given to ensure its success. As for speculations, words and actions must be based on facts and not on unfounded rumours.</p>
<p>▲Report to the Municipal Government: Regarding the initiation, preparation, and funding of the Huangpu River Bridge, as described above, the initiators submitted a report to the municipal government at the beginning of the preparations, requesting approval. Once approved, they can proceed expeditiously, assuming they have made sufficient preparations. If the municipal government does not approve, all the efforts would be in vain. The previous report, besides detailing all aspects, only requested preliminary approval. Once approved, the capital matters can be finalized, and a second detailed report will be submitted for reassurance. For example, the blueprint for the Huangpu River Bridge requires a fee of sixty thousand dollars from a foreign engineer responsible for the project. Due to the lack of approval, the contract has not been finalized. The municipal government requires a more detailed report, and although the official order has not been received, the gist has been gathered from Director Shen of the Public Works Bureau. This is because they are not aware of the initiators' efforts.</p>
<p>▲Construction Project: The construction project has been contracted to the Meng An Company, and the formal contracts have been signed. During a previous meeting convened by Director Shen of the Public Works Bureau, the official letter from the company was submitted. However, Director Shen previously stated that although the company expressed interest, no decision had been made. This is inaccurate. Furthermore, the company has already prepared the blueprints. It has been decided that the company will supply the materials and contract the entire project, ensuring no danger will arise. The design is similar to the latest bridge built by the Italian Constanitin Company. The construction of this bridge was also undertaken by the company and is universally recognized for its convenience and sturdiness. The future Huangpu River Bridge will be completely modeled after it. The bridge will have eleven sections, with tram tracks laid on top so that trams from the Shanghai side can directly reach Pudong. The structural material will be entirely steel, allowing it to rise and fall with the tide. The maximum height will be about sixty-five feet, the minimum height about forty-five feet, and the width about forty-six feet. Whether there will be changes in the future is uncertain, but it is not expected to differ significantly from the above.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Assassinated as Hope Dawns</h3>
<p>▲A Letter from Wang Houzhai</p>
<p>▲Contents Not Without Suspicion</p>
<p>An Zhen Dong, a police officer at the Tanjiaqiao precinct of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, was assassinated on Republican Road the day before yesterday. An's body was inspected by Prosecutor Wu Shixin from the court yesterday afternoon. The autopsy found two bullet holes in An's back and buttocks, confirming that he died from gunshot wounds sustained before death. An's wife, Su, prepared a coffin for the burial, while the Public Security Bureau investigated the murder. Before his death, the deceased received a letter from Wang Houzhai, which is transcribed as follows: "Officer An, respectfully, I hope you are not offended by the hospitality you received at my humble abode yesterday. This letter is not for other matters. As the lunar year draws to a close, I am short on funds. I have mentioned this to you several times, and I trust you are aware of the situation. Now, thanks to a friend's instigation, I can manage to get through the year-end crisis. We plan to have a mahjong game tonight at 7 PM. Three people have already agreed, but we still need one more person. I have nowhere else to turn but to ask you to come and help. I am writing to you in haste, hoping you will not refuse. I will not elaborate further and will provide more details in person. Sincerely, Wang Houzhai, February 8th." The original letter was written on a red-lined monthly statement form. The envelope was from the Jinjiang New Inn on Fourth Road. It was delivered by a special messenger to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. District Chief Qu believed that the sender, Wang Houzhai, needed to be questioned. That evening, he ordered detectives to cooperate with French police officers in the French Concession to arrest Wang at the Yida Meat Shop in the vegetable market. Blank red-lined monthly statement forms, similar to the one used for the letter, were found in the room. Wang Houzhai, also known as Wang San, stated at the Fourth District Police Station that he was 37 years old, from Baoying, and earned a living by collecting swallow nests. He had known An Zhen Dong for eight or nine years and had a good relationship with him. When asked if he had written the letter received by An Zhen Dong, Wang firmly denied it and claimed he had been sleeping in bed all day. He also claimed to know nothing about the red-lined paper that was found. An Zhen Dong had been promoted to police officer at the Tanjiaqiao precinct of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau on August 29th of the previous year. An graduated from the Tianjin Police Training School. In 1915, he was transferred to the Fourth Patrol Team of the Songhu Police Department. In the spring of 1927, he joined the Security Team. On June 1, 1929, he was promoted to Third Class Police Officer. On October 7, 1929, he was promoted to Second Class Police Officer.</p>
<h3>Xue Baobao Sues Over Property Dispute, Court Orders Reconciliation</h3>
<p>▲Photos of Baobao and Her Mother</p>
<p>▲Compared with Photos of Liquan</p>
<p>▲Defendant Absent Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Judge Advises Reconciliation</p>
<p>Xue Wang Amei, the legal guardian of Xue Baobao, the daughter of the late Xue Liquan, previously retained lawyers Pan Cheng, Dong Kang, and others to file a lawsuit against Gu Qiaolin for falsely claiming to be Xue Baobao's biological mother, and against Xue Sun, Jiasheng, Gensheng, Yansheng, Gansheng, and others for fraudulent reconciliation. The case was heard again yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that their clients, the mother and daughter, had arrived as instructed, but none of the defendants had appeared in court, in violation of the court's order. Two photos, one of the late Xue Liquan and one of the plaintiff and her mother, were presented for the court's inspection to compare Xue Liquan's face with Xue Baobao's. It was argued that children born from close relationships in the world often share similar facial features, and a judgment was requested. The defendant Xue Sun, represented by lawyer Lin Yingqing, stated that his client could not attend due to illness. He requested that the court reject the case based on the principle of res judicata. Judge Gong ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation.</p>
<h3>Lu Shaotang Kidnapping Case: Three Suspects Extradited from Tianjin</h3>
<p>▲Secret Telegrams and Letters Discovered</p>
<p>▲Revealing the Whereabouts of the Ring Leader</p>
<p>▲Related to Huang Yuyi Case</p>
<p>▲Both Cases to Be Tried Together</p>
<p>The kidnapping of Lu Shaotang, a comprador at the Fairall Trading Company, was previously reported in this newspaper, with the head detective Lian Kuizheng rescuing him from the bandits' den and arresting the kidnappers. However, as there were many accomplices in this case, some had fled to Tianjin. A formal request was made to the Special District Court to send detectives Liu Shaokui and Lu Shilin to Tianjin to cooperate with detectives from the Tianjin British Municipal Council to arrest Yang Haisong (from Hunan), Peng Ze (from Jiangxi), and Lu Fangting (from Chuansha) at No. 137 on 17th Road in the British Concession. They were transported back to Shanghai on the Fusheng steamer. Yesterday morning, they were presented to Judge Xu for interrogation. According to the Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, the discovery of letters (from the ring leader, who is still at large) and secret telegrams belonging to the three defendants in the bandit's den at No. 55 Oujia Road revealed their hiding places. A special team was dispatched to Tianjin to arrest them. It was found that the bandits who kidnapped Lu were the same group who kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the deputy director of the Zhongnan Bank, on May 27 of last year, and killed Huang's bodyguard. Yang Rusong, one of the bandits, had left Shanghai for Tianjin after the kidnapping of Huang. A postponement was requested to try all the suspects together. The detectives reported the details of the arrest in Tianjin. Yang Rusong was arrested first, followed by Peng Ze at No. 6, Dexin Lane, 60th Road. Lu was hiding in Room 61 of the National Hotel in the French Concession. Judge Xu interrogated Yang, who claimed to have worked in the 9th Division of the Southern Navy during the late Qing Dynasty. After the restoration, he served as an adjutant to a certain fortress commander and a naval commander. At the end of August of last year, he served as the director of the Wuhu Public Security Bureau. After Shi Yousan and Bao Gang rebelled in Anhui in November, he left the Public Security Bureau and went to Tianjin to live in seclusion. The letters he exchanged with his friend (the ring leader) were about business and had nothing to do with kidnapping. Peng Ze also denied kidnapping. Lu claimed to have worked for foreign firms such as Shenchang and Mei Zuishi. His friend (the ring leader) had a car but did not use it, so he borrowed it to drive. Therefore, he went to the Municipal Council to obtain a driver's license, but he had already sent a letter to cancel it. Judge Xu, after verifying their statements, ordered Peng Ze to provide a ten thousand-dollar bail, while Yang and Lu were returned to custody for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>University Student and Worker Accuse Teahouse Couple of Extortion</h3>
<p>▲Student Accuses of "Honey Trap"</p>
<p>▲Worker Accuses of Intimidation</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wu Gan, a student from Fudan University in Jiangwan, and Zhu Qiaohe, a university worker, jointly went to the 5th District 5th Precinct to accuse Feng Youcai, a teahouse owner outside the university, and his wife, Feng Gu (age 28, from Funing), of being involved in a "honey trap" and extortion. Each plaintiff filed a separate case. Wu Gan claimed that he was a student from out of town, so he lived in the dormitory. At that time, other students had already returned home. Feng Youcai instigated his wife, Feng Gu, to sneak into his room. He was unaware of this. Feng Gu took off her clothes and threw them on the bed, then started crying and making a scene in the room. At that moment, Feng Youcai also entered the room, first beating him severely and falsely accusing him of having an affair with his wife. He stripped him of a cotton robe, five dollars in cash, a ten-dollar money order, and forced him to write an IOU for 160 dollars. At the time, he was unable to resist, so he was forced to comply. He requested an investigation. Zhu Qiaohe claimed that Feng Youcai had been arrested as a suspected communist. Because his job as a teahouse owner outside the university could not be vacant, the second landlord of the dormitory, Zhang, asked him to introduce someone to fill the vacancy. Unexpectedly, Feng Youcai was released and immediately started making trouble. The person he introduced resigned. Feng was still not satisfied and demanded that he host twelve tables of banquets (i.e., treat him to twelve tables of wine) or pay him thirty dollars in cash. However, his father had just passed away, and he was just a worker, unable to comply. Yesterday, Feng asked him to go to the Yile Tian Teahouse on the Great World Road for a negotiation, but he was afraid and did not dare to go. He was now afraid of being harmed and requested an investigation. The precinct dispatched police officers to arrest Feng Youcai and Feng Gu. After interrogating them, they made evasive confessions. They were then transferred to the district court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The French Court Continues Hearing the Ri Ye Bank Case</h3>
<p>▲All Parties Hope for Unified Action by Creditors</p>
<p>▲Court Assigns Accountants to Settle Two Accounts</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Ri Ye Bank and the Great World Deposit and Tour Department went bankrupt, the creditors, Xu Peiyuan, etc., consisting of two thousand several hundred accounts, jointly retained lawyers Bian Jialu, Fei Xizhen, Chen Zhigao, Dong Chi, Dong Yu, Yan Luqing, Xu Yannan, and others, to file a lawsuit with the French Court. The case was heard again yesterday afternoon in the French court. First, lawyer Yan Luqing stated that his client had a prior matter to declare. Before he participated in the case, a portion of the creditors residing in the Public Concession had deposited funds into the Zhejiang Road Ri Ye Bank. Therefore, he requested the Special District Court to issue a provisional attachment, which was approved on January 30. However, as this case was accepted by the court, it should await the court's judgment and was not intentionally filed twice. Next, accountant Pan Zhaobang stated that the report on the planning of the liquidation and registration, as instructed previously, had been submitted. As for the Huang family's private property, it had been prepared as collateral and requested to be verified. Lawyers Dong Chi and Chen Zhigao stated that the depositors of the Ri Ye Bank and the Great World Tour Department, although only a small portion, were very panicked since the bankruptcy, which attracted national attention and impacted the entire country. They requested the court to dispatch personnel to liquidate the accounts as soon as possible. At this point, presiding judge Gong Xuan declared that the key to this case was that all creditors must act in unison. Do not appeal to the Special District Court in part, and appeal to the administrative authorities in part. It said that the court had no jurisdiction and had no way to deal with it. It was found that the Ri Ye Bank and the Great World Tour Department were within the jurisdiction of the court and were of great importance. There should be practical ways to either send staff to liquidate the accounts in detail, or recover from the shareholders if there was a shortfall. It was hoped that all creditors would act in unison, which would be beneficial for future interests. At this point, lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that half of the creditors had already filed lawsuits, but there were also many who had given up or were unaware of the situation in other cities. After the Ri Ye Bank and the Great World Tour Department went bankrupt, it was like a person falling ill. Sending personnel to liquidate the accounts was like inviting doctors to prescribe medicine, giving the patient hope of recovery. If severe enforcement was requested, it was like the patient had already died, and the debt would be unrecoverable. He requested permission to send personnel to liquidate the accounts as soon as possible. Furthermore, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer representing the director of the Ri Ye Bank and the head of the Great World Tour Department, stated that the creditors in this case did not act in unison and had posted advertisements in newspapers, which occupied a large space and cost a lot. This action was actually of no benefit and instead caused losses. However, lawyer Tan, the administrator of the Huang family's property, was now present and requested to report on the progress. Lawyer Tan Yigong stated that the Huang family had published a statement outlining the situation. He reiterated that although Huang Chujiu owed the Ri Ye Bank 1.05 million, his property was sufficient to cover the debt, and the creditors need not worry. After Huang's death, various misunderstandings arose between the creditors. He requested that the court order the creditors to act in unison and avoid chaos. At this point, lawyer Yan Luqing requested that the court order lawyer Yao Zhaodi, the defendant's representative, to hand over the shareholder register. Lawyer Yao replied that he would hand it over immediately if it was in his possession, but after Huang's death, all the accounts had been handed over to the accountant. Judge Gong Xuan then ruled, approving the creditors' request, to assign accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Cheng to liquidate the accounts of the Ri Ye Bank and the Great World Tour Department, to report back at any time for further review.</p>
<h3>Xiao Xinan Encouraged to Persevere in Dutch Diplomatic Case</h3>
<p>▲Insist to the end, do not let foreigners ridicule our five-minute attention span.</p>
<p>Since Xiao Xinan was forcibly violated by the chief officer and second officer of a Dutch ship, compatriots at home and abroad have established Xiao Case Support Associations to provide practical assistance. People in Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou and other places have even advocated boycotting Dutch ships, believing that this case is not only a personal humiliation for Ms. Xiao, but also related to our country's international reputation. Yesterday, Ms. Xiao sent a letter detailing her recent situation and her views on the case, which concerned individuals are sure to be happy to hear. The letter is transcribed below: "To the gentlemen of the Shanghai Dutch Diplomatic Support Association, I read the letter in the Shen Bao yesterday. I am extremely grateful. Those in my hometown know me very well. In order to maintain my credit, I came south alone, and encountered this disaster along the way. At the time, for the sake of my personal integrity and national dignity, I struggled with the thugs, clinging to my clothes. Fortunately, I was spared from humiliation. Since arriving in the South, I have been working about seven or eight hours a day, and I am healthier than when I was in the country. I do not feel dizzy. The reason I took seasickness medicine oil in the previous letter, when I was in danger, was as a plan to escape. I did not expect the medicine to be so strong, and I thought my life was about to end. Now that I am out of danger, I am not as sad as before. Yesterday, I received a letter from Consul Wang Defen of Makassar, saying that he had heard that Java Company had given a satisfactory reply, but the consulate had not received any news. I hope that compatriots all over the country will continue to work together to the end. Do not be misled by the Java Company's embellishments or the Dutch people's henchmen. You are the people who care about me the most. Since you were able to extend justice in the beginning, you must be able to achieve a satisfactory result. Please also urge the gentlemen of the supporting groups to persevere to the end, and not to let foreigners laugh at our five-minute attention span. This would be very fortunate."</p>
<h3>Road Robbery Resulting in the Shooting Death of the Head of the Militia</h3>
<p>▲Sentenced to Five Years of Imprisonment and Deportation</p>
<p>▲Referred to the Land Court for Trial</p>
<p>Ni Jian from Wenzhou, the head of the militia in Xinchang, Pudong, came to Shanghai on the 14th of last month to celebrate his brother's wedding. On the 15th, he and his brother, Wenhao, went to see a play at the Qitian Stage. After the show, they planned to stay at his brother Wenhao's house (No. 19, Yong'an Lane, Baer Road, the house of Wenhao's master). While walking on Glock Road in the French Concession, two robbers suddenly rushed out from the side of the road and threatened them with guns, stripping Ni of his fur coat. When Ni and his brother tried to stop them, one of the robbers shouted, and the other robber fired a shot, hitting Ni in the left abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The news was reported previously. Later, at 1:00 AM on the 26th of last month, detectives from the French Police Department patrolling in front of Guonen Temple on Weiermeng Road arrested a robber, confiscated a pistol, and took him to the station. The robber confessed that his name was Wang Lao San, from Jiangbei, and admitted to robbing Ni Jian of his fur coat and shooting him for resisting arrest, killing the victim. The head of the police station ordered him to be detained and yesterday transferred to the French court for investigation. Wang Lao San confessed without denying the charges. Chinese and Western officials sentenced Wang Lao San to five years in a Western prison and to be deported, and to be transferred to the Land Court for trial. The pistol was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Dong Yu's Divorce Case</h3>
<p>▲Problems Remain Unresolved</p>
<p>Lawyer Dong Yu previously filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the French Court, suing his wife, Jiang, for suffering from tuberculosis and requesting a divorce. The case was heard again yesterday. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Dong Yu, stated that he had brought the settlement money as instructed and requested verification. The defendant, Jiang, represented by lawyer Sheng Shengxiu, stated that the child support fee had not been agreed upon, and the plaintiff's uncle had not arrived. At this point, the plaintiff stood up and objected, stating that the defendant's representative lawyer was defending the case today, but asked if there was a power of attorney. Since there was no power of attorney, he asked to prohibit him from speaking. Judge Gong Xuan ordered a seven-day postponement, summoning the defendant to appear in person for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Spring Snow Fell in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The local area has been experiencing continuous rain and variable weather. Yesterday morning, there was heavy rain all day. At dusk, a north wind suddenly rose, followed by heavy snow.

<h3>Wet Nurse Smothers Baby</h3>
<p>▲Lying That it Was Due to Phlegm</p>
<p>▲Wet Nurse Released on Bail Pending Further Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongming's wife Zhu, owner of the Tongkang Xiangfen Liquor, Tobacco, and Sundries store at No. 89 Houxin Street in the French Concession, gave birth to her seventh child, who was only nineteen days old. Because the mother did not have milk, a wet nurse from Shaoxing was hired to feed the baby the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the wet nurse fell asleep that night and did not notice that the baby had been smothered to death in the blanket. The next morning, she falsely reported to the owner that the baby had died of phlegm. The mother reported to the police, who ordered the wet nurse to be arrested. The baby's body was transported to the Forensic Division of the Tongren Fuyuan Church. Yesterday, Zhu, the judge of the French court, was asked by the criminal section of the French police department to come to the place and determine that the baby was indeed unintentionally smothered to death by the wet nurse before death, and should be coffined by the baby's mother, Zhang Zhu, and the wet nurse was released on bail pending review.</p>
<h3>Miss Fan Pengke Arrives in Shanghai Tonight</h3>
<p>▲The ship will berth at Wusong and enter the port tomorrow morning</p>
<p>▲The ship will stay for half a day and then go to Hong Kong</p>
<p>▲Mr. Du Xigui declined the invitation</p>
<p>American movie star Miss Fan Pengke's visit to Tianjin and Beijing this time has been welcomed by all circles. On the 8th, she took the Hongxing Company's Bei'erqinlan ship with 350 people in the world tour group southward from Qinhuangdao. Yesterday, according to Fan's representative in Shanghai, lawyer Ge Sila, he received a telegram from Fan stating that the ship is expected to arrive at Wusongkou around 12 o'clock tonight and will be berthed there. A small ferry will be dispatched to transport Miss Fan and the group members to Shanghai, where they will disembark at the Customs Wharf. It is planned to stay in Shanghai for only half a day, to tour the city and visit major stores, and then take the original ship that evening to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places for sightseeing. Mr. Du Xigui of the Navy, because he was warmly welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Fan when he was in the United States, planned to take advantage of their visit to Shanghai to host a tea party. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, he specially sent Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau of the Naval Department, and Cheng Meiqian, Captain of the Jiankang warship, to visit Liu Yunfang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office to ask him to contact Fan's representative in Shanghai in advance to make arrangements. However, due to the short stay in Shanghai, his representative politely declined.</p>
<h3>Arresting Accomplices of Robbers Escorted from Pudong at the Bund</h3>
<p>▲Several more robbers were captured as a result</p>
<p>Ten Mingzhou, the patrol chief of the Second Division of the Third District of Pudong, was ordered by the chief a few days ago to bring Ding Fugeng, a robber who robbed Jiang Ayuan's house in Yaojiazhai Township under his jurisdiction last July, to Shanghai to track down his accomplices. As soon as they landed at the Bund Wharf on Nanjing Road, robber Ding pointed out that Jiang Fufu, a resident of Pudong who was waiting for a ship at the wharf, was his accomplice. He was arrested and taken to the Laozha Public Concession Police Station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu interrogated him. Subsequently, Chinese detective Yan reported that after Jiang was detained in the police station, he confessed that his accomplices Tang Hanglin, Lu Yunbing, Zhang Quangen, Ma Sannan, and others were hiding at No. 34 Danghu Inn on Shanxi Road. They have now been arrested together. It is said that these people have all confessed to the crime. Judge Xu interrogated the defendants again and ordered Jiang Fufu and the other five to be handed over to the police to be escorted to the Public Security Bureau and then to the court for trial.</p>

<h3>Verification of the Suicide of Two Men by Poisoning</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, two young women lodging at the Xinhuizhong Hotel on Hankou Road were found to have committed suicide by poisoning at the same time. Initially, the names of the deceased were unknown, nor was it clear who they were. It was only when two young men committed suicide at the same hotel a few days ago that it became clear that the deceased were named Qiu Shufang and Chen Shaoying, both actresses from the Bairi Film Company at No. 637 Qipu Road. The deaths of the two women and the two men were all due to being forced by circumstances, so they had the idea of committing suicide by poisoning. One of the men, Wang Tianlong, was Qiu's husband and the manager of the Bairi Company. The other was the deputy manager, named Zhang Yongkang. The reason for the suicide was that they went to Bengbu and other places to raise funds, about 2,000 taels of gold, but unexpectedly all of it was robbed, causing the company's business to be suspended and unable to recover. Therefore, they all sacrificed themselves. Their bodies have been reported to the police station by the hotel and sent to the forensic station on Feilun Road for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu of the Special District Local Court was commissioned to go to the station to verify the facts. However, there was no way to summon the family members of the deceased. After Mr. Xu questioned Wang Zhongdao, a waiter at the hotel, he said that the deceased came to open a room on the third floor on the evening of the 7th, claiming to be brothers, one named Zhou Erlang and the other Zhou Sanlang, from Beijing. After dinner, they closed the door and went to bed. The next afternoon, they were still not seen getting up. When they tried to enter the room, they found that they had embraced each other and died, leaving behind medicine bottles and opium boxes. Since no family members of the deceased could be found, Mr. Xu ordered the bodies to be claimed by the Pushan Villa for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Collection of Tibetan Stories by Gao Bi</h3>
<p>This collection contains forty-eight short stories, mostly stories circulated and told by Tibetans. Dr. Sielden, a British folklorist, collected them during his research on Tibetan customs and folkways. After Dr. Sielden's death, his wife organized his manuscripts and compiled this volume, which was translated into Chinese by Mr. Hu Zhongchi and published by Kaiming Bookstore. We can gain some knowledge about Tibet from this book, and we can also get a glimpse of Tibetan customs and folkways from this book. We cannot but thank the late Dr. Sielden for his hard work in collecting and Mr. Hu Zhongchi for his translation.</p>
<p>Before seeing this book, I had repeatedly gone to bookstores to look for some fairy tales and the like, in order to use them to stimulate my children's interest in reading. However, the selection results were rarely satisfactory to me. Either the meaning was too far-fetched, or the writing was too awkward. This was obviously not in line with children's tastes. Based on my own experience of reading books when I was young, I did not dare to buy them rashly. When the advertisement for the Collection of Tibetan Stories first caught my eye, although my heart fluttered once, I still didn't want to buy it. This was my prejudice, thinking that Tibetan stories might not be of interest to our Han people. If we add to that the tortuous and awkward literal translation, it would be even more difficult for children to be happy. However, after I finished reading this book in one breath, I realized that my previous assumptions were completely wrong. It turned out that the flavor of Tibetan stories was surprisingly in line with our tastes, and the tactful and fluent translation could also increase our reading pleasure at any time. Although there are also a few stories that are not easy to understand, most of them are always satisfactory.</p>
<p>Speaking of fairy tales, they have already occupied an important position in today's publishing industry. Children's nature is inherently simple and innocent, and they are most easily susceptible to external influences. Their desire to hear stories is also the most urgent. We either don't pay attention to children's education, or if we do, fairy tales are the only strongman to supplement knowledge. At the same time, for hints of right and wrong, and the desire for good and evil, we must use them to receive the effect of guidance. We only need to recall the stories we heard in the past, and how deeply they have affected ourselves, to realize how necessary it is to choose fairy tales. According to Mrs. Sielden's preface to the volume, "These stories, passed down from father to son and from mother to daughter, although often full of their superstitions, also contain the flavor of humor and the lessons of moral truth, which we did not expect." That's right, there are indeed many places in the middle that carry the flavor of humor and the lessons of moral truth. But we can also add a sentence, it also develops a lot of alarming points for the meaning of life, some articles only hide the color of satire, and some articles are enthusiastic ridicule, without any politeness.</p>
<p>Let me give a few examples,</p>
<p>In the "Clever Bat" in the East, there is a very witty passage, which roughly says that a king, listening to his wife, wanted to cut off the mouths of all the singing birds. The bat understood the inside story, so he answered the king's words, "…my duty is to keep the number of men and women always equal, and the mortality rate on both sides should not be too high, in order to regulate sexual problems…" The king asked him what to do, and he said, "…sometimes there are more men than women, and some men always say no to the various things that women teach them to do, thinking that everything women say should be done, these men I will make them into women, so that the two sexes can be average…" The king understood the meaning of the bat's words, and was very annoyed, and as a result he decided not to do what his wife had entrusted him to do.</p>
<p>This satirical fable is described so wittily and so loosely. Let's see if there are many such men in the world today who "always say no to the various things that women teach them to do". Should we ask Mr. Bat to regulate them?</p>
<p>The article "Evil Stepmother" also carries a deep meaning, but this article is a complete description. It is necessary to have a complete article before we can recognize its goodness. Fortunately, the "evil" of the "stepmother" does not describe her fierceness and insidiousness from the front, but only shows that she is good at using means and able to arrange her husband. At the same time, it also shows that men are easily deceived by women.</p>
<p>There is also an article called "Making Friends Depends on the Eyes", which is a chronicle with a tortuous background. Although the plot is tactful and moving, the pen and ink clearly reveal the edge of ridicule. Its main point is probably like this,</p>
<p>"…When a person is dying, he said to his son…after you get married, you must wait until you have ten children before you can tell your wife your secrets…after he gave birth to his first son…he told his wife what his father said, and added, although that's the case, I believe you are very trustworthy, so there are some secrets that I still want to tell you…he bought a pig with money…killed it, took off his pants, put the pig's feet in…called his wife…I killed someone…the husband and wife sank it into the pool…one day he and his wife quarreled…she reported that her husband had killed someone…the official and his friends listened to him tell how his father told him when he was dying, how he tested his wife's heart…the official said, you are a smart man…"</p>
<p>The above examples are just light-hearted, satirical and mocking tones. As for "Human's Ingratitude" and "Human and Monkey", they simply openly attacked humans and scolded them heartily. "Human's Ingratitude" roughly says that a passerby rescued a person, a crow, a mouse, and a snake from a deep pit. They all said that they would not forget the great kindness and would definitely repay him in the future. He despised the friendship promised by the crow and others, thinking that the person might be able to help himself. Later, the crow and others all repaid his kindness and were able to save him from disaster. However, that person unjustly slandered him. "Human and Monkey" is also as simple, saying that a monkey saved a person's life, but that person, because he could not sleep well, instead killed the monkey. These two articles reveal the narrow-minded, selfish, fickle, and ugly nature of human beings to the fullest. To put it bluntly, isn't it saying that kind of person is inferior to animals? When we read this, we can't help but feel terrified, and we are just horrified and sighed, (There is also an article "Crow Saves Hunter" which is profound and worthy of careful consideration, I won't mention it here).</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, there is one point I should also state about this book, that is, although many of the stories in it do not have a special intention, they carry a clever rendering and are full of unusual interest, such as "Camel Man and Stone", "Rabbit Kills Lion", "Tiger and Walking Frog", "One Hundred Taels of Silver Lawsuit", and "Foolish Son-in-law" and other articles, all have new and ingenious structures, which are to develop children's minds. This point is especially a necessary condition from the standpoint of fairy tales, because fairy tales must take into account the children themselves. If we indiscriminately spread some absurd and unfounded ghost and fairy tales, it would be too impractical to benefit from them. However, if we only seriously talk about moral creeds, it would also make them unable to understand, and instead feel dry and lonely. Only such wise guidance can truly benefit them.</p>
<p>My introduction to the "Collection of Tibetan Stories" is over. Incidentally, I must also report that many of the Tibetan proverbs attached to the front of each story are famous, witty, and cute, and can be used for our reference. Readers should not let them go easily.</p>

<h3>Japanese Sister by Xiao Jun</h3>
<p>The family that lived next to the open space, with a small square well in front of the door, I had known since I was little. When it came to the hot June weather, almost every day when the sun was setting, I would often run there to play once and then come back. It seemed that my interest and homework were two different things. At that time, I had never investigated it like this. I only felt that there were companions there, which was better than being bored at home.</p>
<p>No matter what, I had to run there, which seemed to dominate the psychology of the young. Wearing a white vest and slippers, walking through a short alley, I could see two children standing in front of the door, facing the cool breeze that gently swayed the willow leaves. One was Yiyi, thirteen or fourteen years old, holding her younger brother's hand, waving to me from a distance. The younger brother also shook off Yiyi's hand and jumped to my side.</p>
<p>"Zhi Ge, you're finally willing to come out when it's almost dark." I rubbed his ash-faced palm while not answering, but smiling and being pulled by him to a place close to Yiyi. Yiyi saw her younger brother's coquettish form, and also pursed a cherry-sized lip and smiled.</p>
<p>"Little brother was looking forward to you, very eagerly." She said, and then glanced at her younger brother with her flexible eyes. At that time, I felt like she would forget all the unpleasant things of the day with one glance, which was a million times better than the suffocating face of the teacher in the classroom. Otherwise, how could I feel happy as soon as I saw her? That mood is not easy to trace now, and it feels like there is a thin morning mist between us.</p>
<p>"Oh, do you want me to tell him to fold paper boats to play with?" I said based on my experience.</p>
<p>"No, I want you to play the Xiao."</p>
<p>"That's easy. Bo, you come with me." The younger brother, rolling his lively eyes, heard me say it was easy, so he followed me in. Yiyi walked in front, running thumpingly up the stairs after passing through a long corridor. The younger brother became very docile, listening to Yiyi making a sound when she put the Xiao in the right place on her lips. This made him anxious.</p>
<p>"Zhi Ge, I must worship you as a teacher, you teach me."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, listen carefully." After taking the Xiao, I played what I thought was the most skillful and beautiful. Yiyi leaned on the railing and sang the matching lyrics in a low voice. Bo also tilted his head and became absorbed. This was a purification of beauty. Although they were all young, they were all drawn in by the faint, not too high or too low sound that cut through the long sky. At the very last section, Bo cheered up, happy like a puppy, saying that I could play tunes that Yiyi couldn't play.</p>
<p>Yiyi also smiled, taking advantage of this time when Bo was crazy about the Xiao, holding my hand and swinging it in the air, insisting on teaching him how to play. I was surrounded by this innocent child, so I pointed out to him from the side, don't use force, gently breathe a little air into it with your lips, and pointing with your finger or opening it, you can guarantee to hear a wisp of sound. Following what I said, the clever Bo learned it very easily, and immediately taught him to practice the scale, which was simply only seven words, and let him repeatedly play there without hindering my conversation with Yiyi.</p>
<p>Yiyi said, "My mother brought a shakuhachi from Japan, it's very thin and not easy to play, but it sounds very beautiful."</p>
<p>At that time, I only knew that this was also a kind of musical instrument belonging to the Xiao, and I didn't have much common sense to get the names of music from various countries, so I just listened silently, and then talked about her mother's life in Japan.</p>
<p>Her mother was originally a Tokyo woman under Japanese nationality, living in the Xiaoshi River District. It seems that she has not forgotten it now. She is a very gentle, elegant, and oriental woman. Her grandmother runs a small sake shop. It is said that her father met her when he was studying there.</p>
<p>Before they were born, her mother also helped her grandmother manage the shop. After a while, they also wanted to go there. At this time, their mother taught them to sing Japanese songs, and sometimes played a shakuhachi for them to listen to, but they always felt that it was not as good as the Xiao I played. I don't know what the reason was. At that time, I secretly thought in my heart that if they lived in Japan, they would definitely say that the shakuhachi was good to listen to.</p>
<p>Gradually, Bo could also play simple songs. Every time I went there, I always saw him leaning against the willow tree, which was hugged by three people, under the twilight sky, playing the Xiao. I said,</p>
<p>"Bo can now make a living by playing tunes in the market with this Xiao, very playful Bo." Knowing that I was satirizing him, he immediately pouted and gently hit me with the Xiao's course.</p>
<p>Yiyi, listening to our mocking voices, rushed out with a book, blushing and shaming us. When we met, everyone always made a fuss before we reconciled. Only Yiyi, who was a year older than me, didn't participate much in our vortex of arguments and quarrels, humorous like an adult.</p>
<p>The elegance of temperament is sometimes more than a quiet woman. When there is nothing to do, she plants flowers. The fragrance of the flowers is often sent by the evening breeze, providing us with a pleasant stimulant for summer night chats. If there is a moon at night, it is just the beginning of the full moon. Sitting on a long recliner, seeing her more beautiful and quieter under the moon, due to an instinctive suppression, I once personally praised her as a plain lily flower in my timid heart that was jumping like a deer. There are many other beautiful things that cannot be described in words. The sound of poetry is even more refreshing, which is one of its beauty, like listening to the sound of bell insects rising and falling rhythmically in the distant jungle in the light purple moonlight. People standing in front of the window where the light shines can also stop and don't want to leave as if forgetting fatigue, because one corner of her bedroom faces the street, and she recently moved here because the weather was too hot. Once, for this matter, she wrote a small note to me, saying that there was a small "Fu" character written on red paper on the horizontal of the window, which was the location of her bedroom. The joy of discovering that revelation at night was like enjoying a feast on the senses. I was holding a bouquet of fragrant flowers in my hand. Because the sound of the poetry was too beautiful and too loving, the flowers in my hand were thrown over after all.</p>
<p>A lovely figure stretched out from the window, and I recognized who it was by the faint moonlight before saying, "Oh, Zhi, come in. When I saw these fragrant flowers, I knew it was you."</p>
<p>I came in smiling, because she only likes this kind of flower, which is more fragrant from a distance, like a lotus flower, but more elegant than a lotus flower. The name is a bit vague, but my family plants a lot of it.</p>
<p>"Yiyi, I gave you the fragrance, what will you repay me with?" These words didn't sound like a child's words. She also seemed to be fiddling with the corner of her clothes, deliberately acting shy, which made me bow my head too.</p>
<p>A Xiao hanging on the wall seemed to relieve us, and everyone returned to their original state. That night, the child Bo didn't come. If I had known what was called a tryst at that time, the faces of the two children who sat until very late would have been even more red like fire.</p>
<p>The second year, when I asked about Yiyi's whereabouts, Bo replaced her with his Japanese sister. At that time, I still remembered receiving a slightly long letter from her from Japan.</p>
