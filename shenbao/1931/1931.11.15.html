<p>明日即爲十一月十六矣。此時横梗於我國人之思慮中者。應爲「十六日以後之國聯又將如何。」及「十六日以後我國又將如何」兩大問題。</p>
<p>十六日以後之國聯究又將如何。此一問題。綜合當前之國際形勢而予以分析。吾人當不難獲得正確之答案。自九月十八日以至今日。爲時已歷兩月。國際一再敷衍。一再遷延。坐看日人暴行之繼續發展。坐看公理正義之被蹂躙於强暴。坐看世界和平瀕於破滅之危機。其各懷心事。靜以觀變之態度。蓋已顯露無遺。不然。合全世界外交家之苦慮焦思。果眞無以制蕞爾島國之暴行耶。此蓋三尺童子所可體認其滑稽之内幕者也。</p>
<p>今日世界顯然有三種盟主勢力在。一爲歐洲。即以國聯爲其代表。次爲蘇聯。以社會主義相號召。再次爲美國。則所謂非戰公約之發起國也。歐洲今已日就衰微。蘇聯則尙稱脆弱。獨有一美利堅以金元之王國。執世界經濟之牛耳。鞭笞歐亞。凌轢全球。其勢力正蒸蒸日上。臻於極隆盛之黄金時代。世界各國。今日對於東北事件之態度。各各不同。其所以不同者。則全在於各國利害之差異。歐洲各國如英國。以中國排斥日貨運動之有利於其日就凋落之海外貿易。且欲裁抑日人在我國過度伸張之勢力。故表同情於我國。并不直日本之暴行。但彼困於經濟之凋敝。且扼於法國之控制。除同情而外。决不能以實力助我。法國以欲稱覇歐洲。向欲結好於日以制英。故東京與巴黎之間早已心心相印。對日人之暴行。頗守愼默態度。至於其他各國。都復如斯。靜以觀變。各視其利害關係而斟酌發言。所謂維護公理與正義。特外交家與政治家魔術之串演耳。次之。蘇聯雖號稱扶植弱小民族之社會主義國家。且明知日人在我東北之暴行。即爲對蘇聯之一種直接威脅。但其本身之基礎。尙未建立鞏固。在未達到必要之直接衝突之時機。决不肯輕易與日作正面之衝突。以實力援我。此兩盟主。││歐洲與蘇聯對於東北事件之態度。即已有如上文之分析。而最具實力之華盛頓政府。則又以（一）其本國之金元勢力已足以支配世界。不必要更以武力爭奪殖民地。（二）日本公債之大部分。執於美</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>國中産階級之手大多數人民。都不願參與引起戰爭。（三）明年大選。此時不願興兵。（四）明年軍縮會議。希望日能參加。（五）欲藉日爲遠東防制蘇聯之第一道防線。有此五因。故目前態度極爲曖昧。我與彼旣無聯絡。日亦不願與之挑釁。其將來態度如何。當更不難預測。</p>
<p>由於上述事實之說明。則吾人可以推知十六日以後國聯重開。其敷衍也必如故。遷延待時。亦必如故。迄其最後。當仍將以華盛頓政府之金元勢力爲中心。出而任調人。我國是時是否能伸其寃屈。是否能處於若何有利之地位。此又三尺童子所可逆揣而知者也。</p>
<p>日本利此環境。趁此時機。持維護正當權益之謬論。以强硬之態度。縱横捭闔之手腕。貫澈其所謂對滿蒙之積極政策。蓋爲勢所必然。日來日軍正積極侵我黑省。擄溥儀入瀋。並在天津肆其陰謀與暴行。瞰時審勢。籌之熟矣。現日之第一流外交人物。都已集中巴黎。對於東北事件。竭全力以周旋。其國際共管我國之謬論之鼓吹。益足以顯示其正準備進一步予我以制命之打擊。十六日以後之來日。正極艱難。獨是此艱難。不僅我國切實感受。世界各國。蓋亦無不驚惶錯愕。艱於應付也。</p>
<p>吾人今如欲再發問十六日以後之我國究又將如何。此問題之重心。在於我政府。政府此時是否已有應付之方策。吾人固不得而知之。但證之眼前之事實。如在軍事上無充分之準備。在内政上尙未有健全之組織。在外交上雖有外交委員會之組織。但未聞有何建樹。各國使節。際此時機。尙多虚懸。在此最嚴重之時機。而駐留各國之使節。尙未派出。更如我施肇基代表出席國聯。孤力奮鬥。政府究曾予以若干經濟上之接濟。凡兹所言。皆足以證明政府之忽視外交。軍力旣無以抗暴。外交又無以制勝。坐視人之縱横捭闔。協以謀我。徒日乞憐於國聯。呼助於和平。是眞爲燕巢飛幕而不知危。十六日以後究將如何。究能如何。依據事實之解答。當亦不外乎舉國民族之生命。無保留的信任國際。靜待宰割而已。然而吾人敢深信我民族尙未死。我民族精神尙未死。當政府終始軟弱無能臨於絕境之日。即我人民起而奮鬥圖存之時。寗爲玉碎。不爲瓦全。以鐡與血爭取國家之人格與民族之生存。吾人深信中國人民已一致具此决心。兹且鎭靜以待十六日以後局勢之展開。</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>湘軍血戰乏覆</p>
<p>甲午之役。湘撫吳大澂請纓討日。朝旨報可。吳統率湘軍二萬人。駐札錦州城外。（該軍爲劉松山劉蓉叔侄舊部。向以善戰著。）共紥大營十座。連營一百里。刁斗相聞。聲勢頗壯。前鋒時有接觸。屢獲勝仗。其時翁綬琪爲營務處。翁以書生從戎。膽大心細。每夕帶領馬弁十餘騎。巡視各營。及至第二道防綫。已在夜午。忽見左邊一縷火光。上冲霄漢。形同流星。未幾右邊亦起。翁疑爲敵兵暗號。催騎前行。一面飛報吳帥。而連續上冲之火光。已在身後。比及吳下令退却。而日軍已從兩翼抄出。翁護吳狂奔而獲免。總退之湘軍。適爲日軍包圍。血戰一晝夜。斃敵萬餘人。卒以援絕彈盡。肉薄死鬥。全軍二萬人。無一被俘生還者。是役也。日軍死亡之數相捋。吳欲回任湘撫。湘人羣起反對。乃罷。</p>

<h3>佛蘭克林（二）</h3>
<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>佛蘭克林做徒弟的時候看書寫文差不多都是自己。敎自己一天他得了一册旁觀週刋Spectator之合計本，高興極了，每讀一篇，把要點録下，過幾天，自寫一文，與原文比一比，取人之長，補己之短。這種功課是在每天開工前完工後及星期偷閑幹的。因爲學的法子好，所以進步很快。</p>
<p>他十六歲的時候，偶然遇了特里翁Tryon寫的一本勸人吃素的書。他讀了這本書，受了深刻的影響，便立志不吃葷。一個十六歲的孩子不吃葷，眞是一樁新聞。誰知這件事是與他的學業有不少的帮助。他的老板哥哥和同事們在隣居寄飯，他一個人在店裏吃素。他的食譜是餅乾，麵包，葡萄乾，酸蘋果和一杯清水。飯錢省下一半可以多買書看。一餐飯，只要幾分鐘便吃完，又多加了一些時間去用功。他自己說，吃得少，頭腦格外清爽。</p>
<p>現在他得到賽諾芬Xenophon寫的蘇格拉底言行録，Memorable　Things　ofSocrates傾倒在蘇格拉底的對話法。他開始用謙虚的問話，懷疑的態度，把人家逼得無話可說，有時連素負盛望的名人都被他問到。他在青年的夥伴中居然成了一位蘇格拉底，波士頓便是他的雅典。</p>
<p>一七二一年他的哥哥開辦新英吉利報。這時佛蘭克林已經會做文章，但怕哥哥輕視他年幼，不給登載，便用假名投稿，每次都被披露，聽人稱贊幾句，非常歡喜。後來，他哥哥因登載政論，得罪議會當局，被捕一月，靠佛蘭克林之支持，得未停頓。詹姆士被開釋仍不准辦報，便以弟弟之名頂替，佛蘭克林於是以一個十七歲，徒弟還未做滿的孩子，居然做起報館的總經理和主筆來了。</p>
<p>詹姆士雖是親哥哥而虐待佛蘭克林如一般師傅之虐待徒弟，有時竟行兇毒打。兄弟二人因此决裂，佛蘭克林丢了報館，賣書凑盤費向紐約去謀生。船過布洛克島Block　Island大家開始捉鰵魚燒的吃，吃得津津有味。有人請他吃魚，他因吃素，猶豫不决。忽然看見一個大鰵魚的肚子破開，裏面有幾個小魚是它生前吃進去的，他便説：</p>
<p>「你既可以慘吃同胞，我也看不出有什麽理由不可以吃你。」</p>

<p>庚戍日韓合併。日之虐待韓民。慘無人道。韓之人。敢怒而不敢言。韓之宗室。除李完用。與金葵忱在上海組織一集會。宣言日韓合併之利益。賣國求榮外無有不以恢復祖國。呼號於當世之主持正道者。爲將伯之一助。海牙和平會。執平亭國際之牛耳。韓平政院院長李雋。秉性剛直。痛祖國之淪亡。效秦庭之哭師。求救於海牙和平會。冀有回天之力。仗義執言。使韓國完全獨立。脫離日之覊軛。詎知世有强權。久昧公理。和平會不過帝國主義之友善者。春風驢耳。袖手旁觀。將李之訴狀。却之不受。李雋搶地無門。呼天不應。自思靦顔事日。何以生爲。援國亡與亡之義。即於和平會中刺刃於腹。噴血而亡。歐西各報。無不痛惜。謂韓雖亡。而忠臣義士。視死如歸。亦爲東亞民族之特殊性質。三韓志士。鑒於李之忠烈。思爲祖國復仇。組織獨立政府。以申狸睨觀爲外交總長。分遣忠臣遺裔。求學四方。冀復九世之仇。李院長哲嗣從予避三載。忠實耐勞。沈默寡言。有乃父風。時予校舉行十週紀念。編安重根烈士刺伊藤事。名「聖俠傳」即以李公子憶起安烈士。悲憤塡膺。大有荆卿要離氣概。精神奕奕。不愧忠烈後裔。安烈當年。九一九之事。日人侵略東省。獸蹄鳥跡。咄咄逼人。惜無如李忠烈安烈士其人。舉彼兇殘而殄滅之。中國之大。對於韓人。有愧色矣。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>慘而又醜的把戲</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>時代向前進。但是日本軍閥的思想却向後退。他們握着帝國主義的威權。又在我國的東三省演了一幕把戲。一幕慘而又醜的把戲。</p>
<p>節節進佔我國的土地。繼續屠殺我國的人民。破壞國際聯盟與九國非戰公約。他們又在蹈威廉第二的覆轍。他們却不知道强權已不能容納在現在衆目昭彰的公理之下。</p>
<p>你看。在待遇不平等下的那些弱小民族。不是每日都在那裏做恢復自由的運動嗎。但是日本的軍閥們。却還想在這時候把這個偌大的中國吞下肚皮裏去。豈不是一個蛇吞象的笑話嗎。</p>
<p>日本當局說。因爲中國抵貨。他們纔進兵。却不想日本越是出兵。中國越要抵貨。這就是「壓力愈大。抵抗力亦愈大。」的道理呀。日本人連這點腦筯都没有。毋怪他們要發狂了。</p>
<h3>遷安菓樹秋花之佳話</h3>
<p>— 沈天英</p>
<p>霜降時節。木葉盡脫。林端樹杪。已充滿甚深之不景氣。而北寗路上之遷安。忽以羣樹秋花聞。</p>
<p>縣南四里許。有黄台山也。層巒聳翠。風景殊絕。山間菓樹盈千。頻婆尤夥。重陽已過。突然二次作花。萬紫千紅。與秋嵐楓葉相輝映。奇事轟傳。游人聚訟。縣長滕紹周氏。雅擅詞章。忽動文興。迺爲辭祝之。駢四儷六。一時傳誦。亦佳話也。一昨友人遺書録示。亟誌之。</p>
<p>歲逢辛未。節逾重陽。白帝司權。金飈應候。正荻白蓼紅之際。恰橙黄橘緑之時。雖有蠭媒蝶使。難爲文杏催粧。况當雨慘風凄。誰與海棠乞命。此所以歐陽作賦。獨寄嘅乎秋聲。工部唫詩。致興懷於遲暮也。</p>
<p>然桂庭露冷。尙浥濃薌。菊圃霜凌。猶要晚節。得天獨厚。旣爲間氣所鍾。禀性特殊。因而孤標自賞。蓋不屑與三春楊柳。兢虚榮於一時。斯能異夫九夏芙蓉。殿羣芳而獨艶。所可異者。灤水之湄。黄台之麓。地非韋曲。境異河陽。五十畝負郭腴田。陰成種樹。數百株頻婆嘉菓。味美於回。胡爲落葉飄搖。竟爾敷榮絢爛。一林錦繡。不聞燕語鶯歌。十里香風。偏值雁歸蛩病。豈具傲霜之性。與殘菊而爭妍。何來媚世之姿。偕晚楓以俱赤。商山過客。誤認飛霜。上苑詞人。幾疑落霰。蘭因絮果。容或有因。秋實春華。偏敎失實。豈含華藴秀。方吐未盡之英。抑歛陰鍾陽。故墮重開之粉。仿柳垂於太液。居然三起而三眠。非稻刈夫瑯琊。羗乃再收而再熟爲休爲咎。或吉或凶。事旣反常。疑終難釋。如以其爲休焉。則國家多故。憂患方殷。南顧江淮。已成巨浸。東瞻遼瀋。被噬强鄰。丁兹陽九。詎有禎祥。如謂其非吉焉。凶也。則紹周謬膺民社。作宰令支。凡諸禍祟。不妨叢集於我躬。一切災祲。祈勿稍加乎黎庶。或者私猶未去。則爲奉法於三無。倘其刑有未明。更願求情於五聽。</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十七）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>其實那班案目，看鄕下人有些呆頭呆腦，向傍人暗示，稱之爲阿木林。鄕下人誤認他的外甥阿木林，眞在此地。他不住的睜大了眼睛，向四面觀瞧。</p>
<p>「喂！今晚是梅蘭芳的霸王别姬，停一刻兒座位是要賣滿的。」一個大塊頭的案目，蹣跚着走到鄕下人身邊，想招攬這位鄕下看客。</p>
<p>鄕下人想：我們鄕下小孩子盤槓子玩意兒，做出來的把戲，祗聽得有一種姿勢，呌做「張飛賣肉」。倒没聽說還有「霸王劈雞」。不想梅蘭芳，却還有這一手兒工夫。</p>
<p>但是他一心要找到他的外甥，没有空閑功夫去看霸王劈雞，只搖着頭，向那位大塊頭案目道：「不看！不看！」</p>
<p>他望到大舞臺的對面，祗有一家糖食店，那糖食店的招牌，寫着「文魁齋」三個大字。</p>
<p>鄕下人有些疑惑：不要我這位外甥阿木林，他又改了行，不給人家掃街看衖堂，又去當了糖食店裏的夥計嗎？不差！他是從小就喜歡吃甜東西的，做了糖食店的夥計，可以常常甜甜他的嘴了。鄕下人在記憶裏，猛然想起了阿木林吃橄欖的一個故事起來，不覺自己笑了。</p>
<p>原來阿木林從小不懂得吃橄欖，有人給了他一個橄欖，說是可以吃的。他咬了一口，覺得其澀非凡，忙不迭的吐出來，向茅蓬上一丢。還駡人道：「你是騙人的，敎我來上當。」剛說完時，覺得嘴裏有些兒甜津津了，他連忙爬上茅蓬，去尋他丢了的橄欖。拿下來再咬一口，又覺得澀而且苦，他說：「到底不是好東西。」又把橄欖向茅蓬上一丢。但是過了一回兒，嘴裏又覺甜津津了，又去爬上茅蓬尋橄欖。可憐那個茅篷已經年久失修了，被他幾次一爬，便坍下來了。爲了一個橄欖，爬坍了一間茅篷，被他媽重重的打了一塲。這是他小時節的一個故事。</p>
<p>爲了嘗着些微兒一點甜頭，弄得自己主意不定，究竟還吃了一個老大的虧。阿木林就喜歡那個甜津津的，他倘然當了糖食店裏的夥計，不是如了他的願嗎。　　他看見了文魁的店號，連忙走近前去一看，不覺詫異道：</p>
<p>「咦！怎麽有兩家文魁齋呢？不要是我眼花了嗎？」</p>

<h3>上週美棉堅穏之由來</h3>
<p>做多心思甚濃引起空户之抵補</p>
<p>麥市及銀價有力益足令人興奮</p>
<p>紐約十三日來電報告一週中之棉市云、政府棉産估計又增六十餘萬包、殊出衆料之外、但報告發表之後、未能使賣出激增、因之價值銳漲、可見做多者預定於報告後買進、遂使賣出者裏足、且引起空户之抵補也、况麥市及銀價有力、益足令人心奮興、其後市况轉形混亂、呈參差不定之象、有若干地方之供給、在假期之前、可望增加、而於漲價之能否維持、頗爲懷疑、同時以普通事業之樂觀激起投機及投資者注意於原棉也、南方之囤持運動、續在努力之中云、</p>

<h3>勞動經濟</h3>
<p>— 任硯耕</p>
<p>朱通九著黎明書局出版</p>
<p>讀過朱通九先生的「工資論」的、誰都知道朱先生對於勞動問題的造詣之深、現在這本勞動經歷、更足顯示出作者學識的博淵、與見解的獨到、誠如作者所說、「我國勞工問題書籍、近年出版頗多、惟該項書籍、非祇陳原理、而忽略事實、即從述事實、而忽略原理、過與不及、於敎讀上、均感不便、」而本書確能「力避此項缺陷、事實與理論、兼籌並顧、」</p>
<p>本書第一注重經濟的背景與經濟制度的變遷、以解釋勞動運動的發生、第二解釋法律政治與思想的變遷、與勞動運動、互爲因果、換言之、非法律政治與思想的變遷、受勞動運動的影響、即勞動運動的興起與衰落、受法律政治與思想的影響、第三詳述工會内部的組織及工會的技術、並由地方的工會推論至全國的工會與世界的工會、以明近代勞工運動的趨勢、第四討論解决勞資糾紛的方法、究從何方面着手、以供給政府當局作爲决定勞工政策的參攷、第五、詳述最近各國的社會思潮並評其得失、本書的特點是在於根據經濟的背境、解釋勞動運動的經過與其解决的方策、</p>
<p>作者自己說、「本書立論、注重勞資調協、但所擬方法、與一般經濟學者的主張、頗有出入、」這點是眞的、作者見解的周到、是我們所不可忽略的事、譬如對於「資本主義」的認識、作者這樣說、</p>
<p>「資本主義爲工商業發達原因之一、而資本主義之罪惡、確在資本主義發展到最高度之後、故愚意資本主義發達的國家、急宜糾正、以免其罪惡的增加、而工商業未發達的國家、爲發展工商業起見、似不宜遽行擯斥、故孫中山先生對於發展我國實業的步驟、分而爲三、（一）在資本未積聚以前、急宜鼓勵私人資本之積聚、個人資本所不及之大規模的生産事業、亦由國家經營、以防私人資本的過多、（二）所有一切的大規模的生産事業、完全由國家經營、以實行國家資本主義、觀此、吾人對于資本主義的態度、應以環境爲轉移、庶可免削足就履之誚、」</p>
<p>這種見識、不但不是隨聲附和的老調、而對於總理民生主義、亦給予了新頴的闡發、所以馬寅初博士說、「朱君對於資本主義的認識、可謂觀察清楚」、</p>
<p>本書對於事實、不僅有獨到的見解、而於解决勞動問題的方法、亦是一樣、本書以勞資調協爲解决勞動問題的方策、而達到勞資協調的方法、則又有二方面、一面是治標的方法、别一面是治本的方法、治標的方法是調解與仲裁、而治本的方法則爲採用工廠會議制、以增高工人地位、且不說治標的方法、我們來看治本的工廠會議制度究是什麽東西、作者解釋工廠會議制之爲物、說、「工廠議和制、係一種工業的德謨克蘭西、其辦法與内容、與現制完全不同、按現在的工業制度、對於工廠内部的管理及對外政策的决定、定全操在資方手中、故資方爲支配階級、勞方爲被支配階級、但工廠議會制則允許工人選舉代表、得參予工廠的重要會議、並對於一切工人的權利的增滅、亦須由議會通過、始能執行、由是可知、工人從被支配階級、一變而爲有參予工廠管理我的支配者、此種工廠議會、非工業的德謨克拉西而維何、」本來、一切的勞動問題、如工資問題、工時問題、罷工問題等、都是由於勞動者與資本家之間的關係問題而起、主要的原因就是由於資本家與勞動者之間的階級對立、假如實行了工廠議會制後、勞動者與資本家站在一條線上、也就是對抗階級關係的消滅、則勞動問題自然解决過半了、關於勞資調協的論調、故不知有多少人說過、但大多是空言而没有方法、本書却提供了這個妥善的辦法、不能不說是其獨到處、</p>
<p>全書二十章共五百餘餘頁、在勞工問題書籍中、堪稱大觀、其他各重要的獨到理論、繁不勝述、留給注意勞動問題及經濟問題的讀者們、自己去理解吧、（完）</p>
<h3>農村社會學大綱</h3>
<p>— 艾森</p>
<p>馮和法著黎明書局出版</p>
<p>在本年中國經濟學社開年會以後、申報社論提出中國經濟問題研究的重要、以爲在這個「根本問題未得解答之先、」其他」幣制問題、金銀問題、關稅及各種稅收問題、」皆如「不附根之枝葉、漫無歸宿、而其討論之結果、亦將終歸於蹈空、無補於中國經濟之前途、」因之進而向中國經濟問題的第一步、││</p>
<p>一、世界資本主義之現狀及其前途、</p>
<p>二、資本主義之整個性、</p>
<p>三、中國經濟在世界資本主義經濟中之地位及其關聯、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>四、中國經濟之變遷與現狀、</p>
<p>五、中國經濟之特質、</p>
<p>六、中國往何處去、</p>
<p>這裏、使我在許多研究中國經濟問題的著作中、突然想起來推薦這部馮和法著的農村社會學大綱了、</p>
<p>本書雖名爲農村社會學、但並不和普通所稱爲農村社會學的相同、祇難亂地提到一些關於農村方面的表面現象、上述六個題目、除第一第二兩個、本書因非其内容所能包括、没有多少述說外、對於其他四個問題、都有充分而新頴的闡發、所以、本書的重要部份、實在還是在於中國經濟研究、即就目録來說、自第四章中國農村人口基礎以後、所取的題材、所討論的對象、完全是由中國經濟問題爲目標的、然而本書和其他討論中國經濟問題的書籍又不同、平常討論中國經濟問題者、常以其所討論的題目爲目標、即限於所討論的本身、而本書則以爲一切社會現象的存立、不僅有其歷史綿延性所給予的因果關係、而且還有各現象互相依倚的關聯、所以本書討論中國經濟問題、完全由整個的社會關係入手、即站在社會學的立塲、來分析各經濟事實的前因後果、與相互依倚的關係、</p>
<p>本書第一點提出、中國經濟問題的重心、還在於農村經濟、爲解答今日中國經濟問題之謎、需先分析農村經濟入手、但也不能忽略對於都市經濟以及國際經濟組織的關聯、中國農村經濟問題的重要、不單如一般所說的、農民佔人口最多數啦、農産物佔中國國際貿易百分之九十以上啦、而是、激動今日中國社會的騷擾、與爲革命的動因的、如勞工問題、盜匪問題、軍隊問題等、完全是由於中國農村經濟的反映、</p>
<p>然而促進中國農村經濟崩潰的、是什麽力量呢、那就是││資本主義的侵公園中冰攝</p>
<p>入、「以二種方法破壞中國農村、一種是商品經濟勢力、打擊農村家庭手工業、並趨之於滅亡、一種是加重賦稅的方法、促進農民離棄其土地、」這不僅在理論上入木三分、極爲深刻、而且本書中所有理論、没有一句是空話、而不補以充分的事實爲根據的、譬如商品經濟的侵入對於農村家庭手工業的破壞、且不待說、而於加重賦稅一項、我們祇要看自帝國主義侵入後、中國政府財政方面的支出、以軍費佔最大多數外、其次是還内外公債、軍費之浩繁是由於内戰之頻仍、内戰之頻仍是由於「帝國主義在中國之地理的分佈」、這種以前所没有的支出的來源、當然是以加重賦稅的方法、向佔人口最大多數的農民剥削而來、這種理論雖則新奇、但誰能否認這是鐡樣的事實呢、</p>
<p>這不過是舉其一點、本書說明資本主義與中國經濟問題的一方面、關於其他各問題、都有同樣深刻的認識、</p>
<p>本書作序者黄枯桐及田中忠夫、推之爲凌越以前所有這方面書籍之作、這是不錯的、這裏祇須提出一點、便可明瞭這本書之對於中國農村經濟的認識、和其他各家不同的地方、譬如大家都說、中國農民貧窮原因之一、是由於「人口過剩」、而本書則說、說中國農村人口過剩、完全是摭拾死去了的馬爾薩斯人口論之餘渣、中國人口並不過剩、所過剩的是「勞動力、」勞動力過剩與人口過剩有什麽不同呢、本書說、「譬如災荒、一方面消滅人口、他方面却又製造了許多過剩勞動力、」其理論之獨到、於此可見、</p>

<h3>胡閙</h3>
<p>— 娟</p>
<p>夜晚十時後、那雖然也是上海的一角、然而沈靜是和黑黯同歸着死樣的境地、街旁店舖的排門、不知是幾時關的、因爲從來不曾注意過這些瑣事、黑夜中偶然遇見、在我是覺得新異的、</p>
<p>因爲街上鎭靜無阻攔、我失魂似的漫瀾狂闖着街心、直向××醫院方面走去、近來心地紊亂的變態、這般浪蕩、自覺似乎是需要、是舒展心懷的、當走到醫院門前、心想就此折回、上床找夢去、但暴亂的心地、轉瞬又起了變卦、最後、終於進了那開着的一扇小門、</p>
<p>門裏是花園、望去比街上更漆黑、門右是院内的門房、門開着、並且射着的燈光中見着一個人影、在他的口中、問明了陳、他值班在外科診察室、</p>
<p>開步想向裏走、不知怎的覺得有些害怕、胆寒、那天給公共汽車撞死的人的死狀、盤旋着我的腦海、記得、當他抬到院的時候、顔面已給血污染得辨不清楚、祇微微尙存一些氣息、當時即經醫生打針施術、在旁的母親、不覺他滿身血污的兒子的髒穢、抱着他呼呌、尤其是「阿囡、醒來啊、囡囡、」似哭似慰的情緒、是刺人心懷、後來終因他失血過多、在最後嘔下一口污血死了、我似乎看見他、呼吸遲慢的喉節動作着、黑紫的污血在他唇邊沿湧、我有些寒慄、</p>
<p>「啊、朱先生麽、」有人呌着我、聲音是很覺厮熟、</p>
<p>那人在黑處已走到面前、燈光下、認很是茶役阿榮、他手理還拿了八九本曲譜、</p>
<p>「那是送到陳先生那邊的麽、」我指着他手中的曲譜問、</p>
<p>「是的、」</p>
<p>我在他陪伴下、已到外科診察室、診察室非常光亮、裏面雖然祇有八九個人、然而是很熱閙、因爲有着一個綽號蠻囡的沙、和老猴有名的顧彧、陳坐在手術椅上、手中還拿了口琴、他的旁邊立着密斯唐和金、其餘幾位是散亂地立或坐着、她們都是值班的看護生、</p>
<p>「曲譜、曲譜、」願彧做着異樣的音調、和滑稽的舉動說、</p>
<p>「密斯唐你和小陳很好、你們合唱Love　Parade給大家聽吧、」</p>
<p>蠻囡沙調笑地說、並順手遞過阿榮手裏的曲譜、找着璇宫艶史的「愛的集合、」</p>
<p>「蠻囡、你笑人麽、金是什麽、」陳說、</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈、密斯金、密斯金、」顧彧頑皮地取笑着金說、</p>
<p>顧彧獻技吧、密斯徐、夢裏也翹望着你呢、」金說、</p>
<p>……啦啦咪啦……顧彧不知什麽時候在陳的手中拿的口琴、他在吹奏、</p>
<p>「喂、不要假痴假呆、」金緊迫地報復着說、</p>
<p>「好、獻醜、密斯金、看吧、」</p>
<p>顧放了口琴、雙手一拍、倒豎着蜻蜓</p>
<p>「嗤、那才像猴兒出把戲、顧、這裏不是江北大世界、」</p>
<p>「不是技麽、」顧問、</p>
<p>「停吧、酸呢、」女看護士費說、</p>
<p>大家看着沙的面孔笑、</p>
<p>「别胡閙了呵、談談救國方略吧、」陳說、</p>
<p>陳雖像很關切、其實那是一種病態的表露、「鄭重的人、决不會感覺得缺少伴侣、」他不能遁逃的心地、是這樣吐露過一會的、</p>
<p>這個時代胡閙、似乎太麻木了、</p>
<p>我的眼前蕩動着「西線戰事」的幻影、見着上前線的兵士們背着的槍尖上的鮮花、</p>
<p>四洮路戰事、希望更進一步、有機會給我們上前線、贈送槍尖上的鮮花的人呵、鮮花或者會有策勵性的、我們再胡閙一陣麻木的舉動吧、</p>

<p>那是一個風和的日子、雖然天降一些時雨、太陽温暖地照着、氣候凉快得可愛、我們於一天的午前十一點鐘動身去參觀暹羅國立博物院、在二十分鐘的中間我們就達到目的地了、那時我們没有碰見許多人、我們聽過人家說、當着這個博物院改造完竣後、在初開幕出來供人遊覽的頭幾個星期裏、到這裏來游覽的人是很衆多、││博物院這個巍峨的建築物、包含着許多的屋宇、（此中有些的部份、作爲暹羅國立圖書館的用、）這院底位置、適當大皇宫底東部、至皇宫底各庭闕、各有各的名稱、這個輝煌的皇宫是爲暹皇拉瑪二世所建築、其上棟下宇的建築是仿傚中國底皇宫底形式的、</p>

<h3>Wu Brigade of Jiang Province Fiercely Fights with Japanese Troops Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cheng Brigade Joins the Front Line, Japanese Troops Retreat Again. Japanese Troops Dig Trenches in Tailai.</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 4:00 AM this morning, 700 Japanese cavalry and artillery, detoured from the west towards the third line of defense of our cavalry Wu Brigade, while the Japanese troops on the front launched artillery fire to contain our infantry and artillery units. In the fierce battle that lasted until about 6:00 AM, Sha Shengui, the commander of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of our army, was wounded by stray bullets, and the front line was on the verge of collapse. At that time, Tu Quansheng's regiment of the Manchuria Mileage Cheng Brigade arrived and joined the front, and the soldiers cheered and fought bravely, greatly boosting morale. After 8:00 AM, the Japanese troops retreated. This afternoon, the Japanese troops continued to use small units of cavalry to harass our third line of defense in the Mogu Creek and Tangchi area on the flanks. Our army has increased two cavalry regiments in that area, and the position has been consolidated. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) After 11:00 PM on the 12th, more than 700 Japanese infantry and artillery attacked our Xinlitun infantry defense line, firing more than 80 cannons. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy retreated. At 7:00 AM on the 13th, they attacked our Lienuotou cavalry position with a small unit, using machine gun teams as vanguards, and under the cover of fierce artillery fire, they rushed close to our three battalion trenches twice, but were repelled. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Heihe on the 13th. This office received a telegram from Ma Zhanshan, Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang, stating that more than 1,000 Japanese troops came to harass this time, and more than 500 were killed. They hurriedly transported away six airplanes, and four were shot down and destroyed. Zhang Haipeng looked like a madman, and had moved all his family members and property to the depths of the Shanli Shaoguo to hide. His troops were under too much pressure from the Japanese and had no fighting spirit. Japanese troops were digging trenches in Tailai to prevent our counterattack. Our army's morale is very high, fighting bravely in battle, and it is expected that we can win the war to protect half of our three northeastern provinces. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Japanese and Zhang's troops have been fiercely attacking the Heilongjiang army for days. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese troops currently facing Jiangqiao include one brigade commander, one infantry regiment, one cavalry regiment (with two companies not yet arrived), 30 cannons, 14 airplanes, 8 heavy cannons, and 3 armored trains, with a total strength of 5,000 men. Recently, the Japanese troops have been harassing our front line with small detachments every day, while simultaneously trying to outflank Jingxing with large units. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Japanese expatriates in Manzhouli and Hailar have all been evacuated from the country on the 13th, escorted back to Japan by local consulate officials. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

Ma Zhanshan ordered the people's militias in various counties, which were formed a month ago, to go to the provincial capital for training. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A special dispatch from Dalian states that the Japanese Kwantung Army Command publicly announced the following regarding the Jiangqiao battle: "This battle near Daxing involved 4,000 soldiers of Ma Zhanshan's army, who had built solid defensive positions for more than a week. In order to unify morale, they attacked the Japanese army. After the battle began, the Heilongjiang army received strong reinforcements from Ding Chao and others, and within three days, they concentrated more than 6,000 fresh troops to attack the left flank of the Japanese army. The Japanese army initially had only a few hundred soldiers, and even at the end, it did not exceed 2,000. With a weak force, they were able to hold out against a large enemy army from beginning to end. The offensive and defensive actions of Ma Zhanshan's army, as well as the tenacity of the soldiers, were unprecedented. On the sixth day of the war, the Ma army was so tenacious that they even drew their swords and shouted without retreating. Their bravery is truly astonishing." (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Ping to report that more than ten Japanese airplanes bombed the area of Shijianfang and Ang'angxi again this morning. Last night, Japanese troops fiercely attacked our key defense position of the Three-Room Cavalry Artillery, and then retreated to reinforce with 2,000 men. There has been no formal contact yet. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Airplanes Bomb a Section of Jiangqiao and Fly to Ang'angxi and Other Places for Reconnaissance</h3>

(14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Four Japanese airplanes flew over our defense line in Sanjiantun for reconnaissance at 11:20 AM this morning and were repelled by our army's artillery fire. At 11:40 AM, they flew over Ang'angxi for reconnaissance for half an hour without dropping bombs. At 12:10 PM, three planes flew to Heihe and one plane flew to Fularji, each conducting reconnaissance for ten minutes before leaving. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Haipeng's Troops Do Not Obey Japanese Orders</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Since the night of the 12th, the troops coming to our front line have all been Japanese troops. Zhang Haipeng's troops no longer obey Japanese orders. The report that Zhang Haipeng killed Japanese soldiers who were monitoring him as he fled has not yet been confirmed, but it is true that Zhang has become passive. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Haipeng has intentions of repentance. Zhang Zijunjie is scheduled to leave Ping tomorrow night at 8:00 PM and return to Taonan. Deputy Zhang and Wan Fulin both have handwritten letters to Zhang. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

The Minister of War instructed Honjo to negotiate on five points: (1) Ma Zhanshan must withdraw the troops gathered in Qiqihar and Ang'angxi to their original locations, leaving only the original garrison in Heihe and not sending troops south of the Chinese Eastern Railway line. (2) The Tao'ang Railway will be managed by the original Railway Bureau, and Ma Zhanshan's troops will not interfere with railway administration. (3) If there are any actions that obstruct railway administration, the Japanese army will take any measures it deems necessary. (4) The above conditions must be implemented before November 25th. (5) After these conditions are implemented, the Japanese troops in the Nenjiang area will withdraw to Taonan or Zhengjiatun. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Honjo, the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, has requested permission from the Chief of the General Staff to act freely when necessary. It is expected that Honjo's move is likely to consider military action north of the Nenjiang River necessary. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kumamoto Today, Japanese Chief of Staff General Kanaya received an urgent secret telegram from Kwantung Commander Honjo. Immediately convened a military meeting. However, due to the serious nature of the matter, it is said that it must wait for consultation with the Ministry of the Army and the Cabinet before a decision can be made. The content is kept strictly confidential and is expected to be related to the tense situation on the Tao'ang Railway. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Reply to Honjo's Ultimatum Sternly Rejects Japanese Demands</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Honjo's ultimatum demanded that Ma Zhanshan withdraw from Heihe before noon on the 13th and withdraw his troops. Ma replied in the afternoon of the 13th, saying roughly: 1. I can resign, but the central government must send someone to take over and have a formal order. Someone like Zhang Haipeng cannot be entrusted with political power. 2. Regarding the withdrawal of troops, I have sovereignty over my territory, and no foreigner can interfere. 3. The Qike Railway was built by China and cannot be ceded to Japan. I have a responsibility to defend the territory and cannot cede it to Japan without government orders. At the same time, legally and factually, it is not something your country should demand.

<p>(Beiping) Harbin telegram, Tokyo Foreign Ministry declared on the 13th that the aide-mémoire delivered by Honjo's representative, Major Hayashi, to Chairman Ma at noon on the 12th was a "friendly note." A certain English newspaper here commented on this matter, describing the Tokyo Foreign Ministry's statement as "eloquent and specious." The main idea was that this statement was an unprecedented and humorous masterpiece, and that the definition of "ultimatum" should be deleted from the Japanese dictionary to suit the use of diplomats defending warlords. Furthermore, after the Japanese government accepted the advice of the League of Nations and various countries to cease military action in the Northeast, it suddenly issued this "friendly note" demanding withdrawal within a deadline, which is detrimental to Japan's international friendship.

<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Vice Zhang and Wan Fulin that Honjo sent Hayashi Hideyoshi again at 8:00 PM on the 13th to visit Zhanshan, demanding that the Heilongjiang army withdraw from Heilongjiang immediately.

<h3>Japanese Military Police and Police Conduct Joint Searches for Rioters in Tianjin</h3>
<p>House-to-house Searches Conducted in the Border Area. More than Ten Plainclothes Soldiers Arrested Yesterday.</p>
<p>Search Work Halted in the Afternoon. Both Sides Agree on Buffer Zone Measures.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the case of rioters disturbing the peace in the Japanese concession and Chinese territory in Tianjin, as a result of negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese military police authorities, it was decided that searches for plainclothes soldiers would be conducted on the 14th. The location would start from both ends of the 300-meter protruding area at the border between the Chinese and Japanese territories, and the searches would be conducted simultaneously, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Both sides also agreed that if rioters resisted during the search, the Chinese police could fire back in self-defense. If stray bullets flew into the concession, the Japanese side would understand and not pursue the matter. In the areas that have been searched, Japanese soldiers will retreat 50 meters, and Chinese police will resume their posts and perform their duties. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram, At the beginning of the Tianjin Incident, the Japanese were indeed the instigators, with Zhang Bi as the leader. Most of the rioters lived in the Xilai Hotel and Deyilou and other places. Zhang Bi received a large sum of money from the Japanese. Zhang once boasted that his troops numbered 60,000, and orders could be issued in the morning and reach Pingjin in the evening. The Japanese did not investigate deeply, and gave him guns and ammunition, and launched the attack rashly. After the riot, there were only a little over a thousand rioters, and most of them were coolies. They were timid in the face of danger, and some even hid under the beds. The Japanese soldiers dragged them out by force and forced them to move forward with machine guns, shrinking back and not daring to turn their heads. Many of them have collapsed and scattered in the past few days. The Japanese only realized this at this point. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The banking association, chamber of commerce, and other organizations have proposed a buffer zone solution, to which both China and Japan have agreed. Each side has agreed to retreat 300 meters, which will be guarded by the troops of various countries stationed in Tianjin to maintain law and order. It is being implemented. It will be difficult for the plainclothes soldiers to rise again, and they can be eliminated in a day or two. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The consuls held a meeting at the German consulate from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, deciding to see if there was a way for the Chinese and Japanese to resolve the matter themselves.

<p>(Tianjin) The situation in Tianjin has become tense again. At 4:30 PM this afternoon, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin claimed that his negotiations with the Hebei Provincial authorities on ending the disturbances had broken down. Now, police officers from the Public Security Bureau are stacking sandbags and barrier nets only 50 meters away from the Japanese concession. Therefore, all the defense forces and police of the Japanese concession have been ordered to return to emergency defense. He has telegraphed the Japanese government about this matter, and the Consul General has also requested the Chairman of Hebei Province to withdraw the Chinese troops to 20 miles outside Tianjin in accordance with the Boxer Protocol. (14th Guomin News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Last night there was rain here and it was very quiet. The volunteer corps of the British Concession withdrew after a night of defense. Although the concessions are still under strict guard, public sentiment is slightly calmer. There are widespread rumors that one British and two French were killed by stray bullets. This statement has no basis. Last night, it was heard again that the Chinese and Japanese authorities had agreed on a method of inspecting the neutral zone. This method seems to have started to be implemented this morning. However, the inspection team reported that they found a strong defensive line in the grass huts near the border of the Japanese Concession, surrounded by electrified barbed wire. The Japanese consul also claimed after receiving this news that he had detected a place for placing machine guns 5 meters away from the Japanese concession. This defense line was guarded by Chinese armed policemen. It was then declared that a team of Chinese regular soldiers was found in the neutral zone. Since the two sides were accusing each other, the inspection was stopped. Later, someone discussed this matter with the Japanese consul. It is said that the Consul is not in a position to comment at this time due to unexpected developments, but the inspection may not continue. The Japanese consul also admitted that he had agreed with Wang Shuchang, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, last night on a method to clear the neutral zone section by section, which would be undertaken by armed Chinese police officers accompanied by two Japanese observers. The Japanese vice-consul and one military officer will also be present to supervise. After one section is cleared, it will be occupied by the Chinese police, and the Japanese side will withdraw its defenses to a certain extent. The inspection work is expected to take several days. It started smoothly at 9:00 AM this morning, but shortly after noon, the aforementioned defense line was discovered, and the agreed plan was abandoned. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to reliable sources, the Chinese government will reply tonight to the Japanese ambassador's request to withdraw Chinese troops to 20 miles away from Tianjin in accordance with the 1902 Boxer Protocol. The content of the reply is not known, but it is said that the gist is that China respects treaties and that no troops have ever been stationed in Tianjin. The maintenance of law and order is entirely in the hands of the police and security forces, but if troops are sent to Tianjin to maintain order and protect foreign security, it should not be regarded as a violation of the spirit of the treaty. China is very keen to avoid the possibility of conflict with Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin, so it has ordered the withdrawal of troops from Tianjin at the request of Japan. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Reuters reporter visited the Japanese military headquarters today to inquire about the details of the inspection of the neutral zone. Apart from what has already been reported, there is no new information. However, according to officials at the headquarters, no plainclothes rioters were found at the time. How this case will end is still uncertain, but according to the opinions of well-informed foreigners, if it is delayed for a long time, the poor people in the Chinese territory will be forced by hunger to take risks, leading to great chaos. Regarding the breakdown of the inspection plan, it is currently impossible to obtain definite information from officials. However, according to the Chinese side, inspections began simultaneously at both ends of the neutral zone at 9:00 AM this morning and continued until 3:00 PM in the afternoon. No plainclothes rioters were found. Only three Chinese policemen carrying weapons were found, because they had not received orders to withdraw and had hidden in civilian residences when the neutral zone was demarcated. According to them, there may be others hiding in other houses. According to responsible Chinese sources, the Japanese will implement obstructionist policies to await the convening of the League of Nations Administrative Council. After Japan pointed out that the appearance of Chinese troops in Tianjin violated the Boxer Protocol, the Chinese authorities ordered the Chinese troops to withdraw beyond the ten-mile limit. As a result, a large part of the Chinese territory lost its protection, because the entire Tianjin police force only has 3,500 people. The Chinese authorities also said that a Chinese police station near the Japanese barracks is still occupied by Japanese soldiers. As for the poor people in the Chinese territory, a relief committee has been organized to distribute food, so there is no need to worry. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yano Visits Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Yano Makoto, visited Vice Zhang last night to request that China respect the Boxer Protocol and not station heavy troops within 20 miles of Tianjin. Zhang replied that the Chinese side can respect international treaties. There is no stationing of heavy troops near Tianjin. However, recently, there have been obvious exploitations of concessions as a base for various political background riots, so it is necessary to expand the security police. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reuters learned that Yano, the first secretary of the Japanese embassy, visited Zhang Xueliang this afternoon, requesting that the Chinese troops in Tianjin withdraw to 20 miles from the city in accordance with the Boxer Protocol of 1902.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Speculation on the League of Nations and China After the 16th Based on the International Situation</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is November 16th. At this moment, what should be on the minds of Chinese people are two major questions: "What will the League of Nations be like after the 16th?" and "What will become of China after the 16th?"</p>
<p>What will the League of Nations be like after the 16th? By comprehensively analyzing the current international situation, we should not have difficulty obtaining the correct answer. From September 18th to today, two months have passed. The international community has repeatedly equivocated and repeatedly delayed, watching the continued development of Japanese brutality, watching the trampling of public reason and justice by violence, and watching world peace teeter on the brink of collapse. Their attitudes of harboring ulterior motives and calmly observing the situation have been fully revealed. Otherwise, with the painstaking efforts and anxieties of diplomats around the world, is there really no way to restrain the violent behavior of a small island nation? This is an absurd inner truth that even a child can understand.</p>
<p>Today, there are clearly three dominant powers in the world. One is Europe, represented by the League of Nations. The second is the Soviet Union, rallying under the banner of socialism. The third is the United States, the initiator of the Non-Aggression Pact. Europe is now declining daily, and the Soviet Union is still considered weak. Only the United States, as a kingdom of wealth, holds the economic reins of the world, whipping Europe and Asia, and dominating the globe. Its power is growing stronger and stronger, reaching a golden age of extreme prosperity. Today, the attitudes of various countries towards the Northeast Incident are all different. The reason for their differences lies entirely in the differences in their national interests. European countries like England see the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods as beneficial to their declining overseas trade and want to curb the excessive expansion of Japanese power in China. Therefore, they express sympathy for China and do not directly confront Japan's violent behavior. However, they are constrained by economic depression and controlled by France, and they cannot provide practical assistance beyond sympathy. France, wanting to dominate Europe, has always sought to befriend Japan to restrain England. Therefore, Tokyo and Paris have long been in agreement. They maintain a cautious silence regarding the Japanese brutality. As for other countries, they are all the same, calmly observing the situation and weighing their words based on their interests. The so-called maintenance of public reason and justice is merely a magic show performed by diplomats and politicians. Secondly, although the Soviet Union claims to be a socialist country supporting weak nations and clearly knows that Japan's brutality in Northeast China is a direct threat to the Soviet Union, its own foundation has not yet been firmly established. Before reaching the necessary moment of direct conflict, it will never easily engage in a frontal conflict with Japan to provide practical assistance to China. The attitudes of these two major powers—Europe and the Soviet Union—towards the Northeast Incident have already been analyzed as above. And the Washington government, which possesses the greatest power, (1) believes that its own financial power is sufficient to dominate the world and that it does not need to use force to seize colonies; (2) the majority of Japanese bonds are held by the middle class in the United States, and most people do not want to participate in wars; (3) next year is an election year, and they do not want to start a war at this time; (4) they hope that Japan can participate in next year's disarmament conference; (5) they want to use Japan as the first line of defense in the Far East to contain the Soviet Union. Because of these five reasons, its current attitude is extremely ambiguous. We have no contact with them, and Japan is unwilling to provoke them. It is not difficult to predict what their attitude will be in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the explanation of the above facts, we can infer that when the League of Nations reconvenes after the 16th, it will continue to prevaricate as before and delay as before. In the end, it will still be centered on the financial power of the Washington government and step forward to act as a mediator. Whether China can redress its grievances at that time and whether it can be in a favorable position are things that even a child can guess.</p>
<p>Japan is taking advantage of this environment and this opportunity, clinging to the absurd argument of maintaining legitimate rights and interests, using a tough attitude and skillful diplomacy to implement its so-called active policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia. This is inevitable. In recent days, the Japanese army has been actively invading our Heilongjiang Province, abducting Pu Yi to Shenyang, and carrying out conspiracies and atrocities in Tianjin. They have carefully considered the timing and situation. Currently, Japan's top diplomats have all gathered in Paris, making every effort to deal with the Northeast Incident. Their promotion of the absurd argument of international co-management of China further demonstrates that they are preparing to inflict a further blow to our sovereignty. The coming days after the 16th will be extremely difficult. However, this difficulty is not only felt keenly by China; all countries in the world are also shocked and at a loss.</p>
<p>If we now ask again what will become of China after the 16th, the focus of this question lies with our government. Whether the government has any countermeasures at this time is something we cannot know. However, judging from the facts before our eyes, such as the lack of sufficient military preparation, the lack of sound organization in internal affairs, and the existence of a diplomatic committee in diplomacy but no achievements, and the fact that many embassies in various countries are still vacant at this time, at this most critical moment, ambassadors have not yet been sent to various countries, and our Shi Zhaoji is representing us at the League of Nations, fighting alone. Has the government provided him with any financial assistance? All of these things are enough to prove the government's neglect of diplomacy. Military force is unable to resist violence, and diplomacy is unable to win. Watching others use skillful diplomacy to conspire against us, merely begging the League of Nations for mercy and calling for help for peace is truly like a swallow building its nest on a curtain, unaware of the danger. What will happen after the 16th? What can happen? Based on the answer from the facts, it will be nothing more than entrusting the life of the nation to the international community without reservation and waiting to be slaughtered. However, we dare to firmly believe that our nation is not dead. The spirit of our nation is not dead. When the government is ultimately weak and incompetent and reaches a dead end, it will be the time for our people to rise up and fight for survival. Rather be shattered like jade than preserved like a tile. We will use iron and blood to fight for the dignity of the country and the survival of the nation. We firmly believe that the Chinese people have unanimously made this determination. Now, let us calmly wait for the unfolding of the situation after the 16th.</p>

<h3>Japanese Abduct Pu Yi and Announce His Restoration; It Is Determined That He Will Ascend the Throne in Shenyang Today, and the Japanese Side Allocates 2 Million</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Pu Yi arrived in Shenyang and ascended the throne on the 15th, formally notifying all countries and announcing his restoration. This is extremely absurd. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Shenyang said that the preparations for the restoration ceremony in Shenyang have already been allocated 2 million in cash by the Japanese, which was handed over to Pu Yi for safekeeping and has begun to be handled. The Japanese side intends to promote the realization of the restoration movement before the 16th after Pu Yi arrives in Shenyang. A number of dragon flags that were ordered must be delivered on the night of the 11th. This time, the Japanese are using Pu Yi to restore the dynasty in the three provinces and have decided to adopt a constitutional system. The royal family's expenses are set at 3 million per year, which will only be allocated after the three provinces are unified. A separate Ministry of Internal Affairs will be established. As for the ruling government, it must hire advisors designated by the Japanese. All military and financial powers are controlled by the Japanese. There is fierce infighting among the remaining nobles and elders. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There has been a significant increase in the number of Japanese soldiers in Shenyang recently. Also, because the establishment of the Mingguo Empire is imminent, fearing that our patriotic youth will rise up in opposition, they are firing cannons day and night to demonstrate, and people's hearts are very uneasy. A person coming from Shenyang said that dragon flags have already been made in Shenyang, and it is rumored that Fu Yi will arrive in Shenyang to ascend the throne within a few days. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The claim that Pu Yi escaped from Tianjin to Dalian on a Japanese warship was denied by official circles here today. According to investigations by Japanese officials in Tianjin and Dalian, Pu Yi has indeed left Tianjin privately, but has not arrived in Dalian, and his whereabouts are unknown. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is widely rumored that Pu Yi will go to Liaoning from Dalian on the 14th, ascend the throne on the 15th, and Japan will formally announce the withdrawal of troops on the 16th. Then, Pu Yi will request the dispatch of troops to protect him. At that time, Japan will send troops to Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, and the Northeast Army will inevitably resist. The Japanese will use plainclothes teams in Beiping and Tianjin to create chaos and contain the Northeast Army. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Shenyang Maintenance Committee Plans to Reorganize Finances</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Liaoning Local Maintenance Committee held a financial reorganization committee on the 9th, abolishing the name of national tax and advocating a policy of good governance, abolishing six types of taxes, such as timber license fees. The output tax, bean tax, oil and grain tax, and silk tax are reduced by half. Eight types of direct taxes, such as land tax, are allocated to the county and city autonomous associations for self-collection. Other indirect taxes and provincial taxes are managed by the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces. The annual income and expenditure of the Transportation Committee are handled by special accounting. General accounting specializes in internal affairs, industry, and other items. The surplus of annual income is used for charitable expenses and the reorganization of the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces. The budget for the 20th year has an annual income of 22 million yuan, which is 43 million yuan less than the 19th year. The annual expenditure is 10 million yuan, which is 75 million yuan less than last year. The military expenditure alone has been reduced from 76 million yuan to 3.6 million yuan. Therefore, there is a total surplus of 11 million yuan this year. This plan already has the prototype of an independent country. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Prevents Japanese Ships from Unloading Military Supplies, Causing Attention from Consuls of Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianchao Maru transported 1,000 boxes of military supplies, falsely reporting them as food. After being discovered by the customs, the Japanese refused to inspect them and changed their declaration to export, shipping them back to Dalian. The customs knew it was a fraudulent trick and immediately sent customs officers to board the ship and monitor it. On the morning of the 14th, without waiting for the customs clearance, the ship set sail eastward at 7:00 AM. At the same time, a warship named Asagao, came from Tanggu and met at Gegu, intending to transport the military supplies to the warship and transfer them to Tianjin. Due to the interference of customs officers, they arrived at Tanggu together at noon and stopped at the Japanese military camp pier. Japanese soldiers boarded the ship intending to unload it, but the customs officers stopped them, saying that they had already declared the export in Tianjin and could not unload here. The Japanese were speechless. The ship then exported at 1:20 PM. It is generally expected that the ship will not return to Dalian and will definitely stop outside Dagukou, waiting for the warship to transship them to Tianjin. This matter has aroused the attention of consuls from Britain, the United States, Germany, and France, who are exchanging opinions with each other. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Japanese Concession Authorities Warn Chinese Residents and Japanese Women and Children in the Concession to Leave Tianjin for Dalian</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese unofficially declared to the Chinese residents in the concession that those who wished to leave should leave quickly, and those who wished to stay should quickly dig cellars. They will have a final consultation with the Chinese authorities on the 14th. If there is no result, they are unable to protect them. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese police station also ordered Japanese women and children to withdraw from Tianjin. More than 200 people boarded the Tianjin Maru for Dalian on the morning of the 14th, and more than 300 people boarded cars for Beiping. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Provoke in Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A detachment of Japanese troops stationed in Qinhuangdao suddenly roared at the local Public Security Bureau on the afternoon of the 13th, claiming that weapons, ammunition, and military pay had been stolen by the Chinese and should be compensated immediately. The bureau knew that it was an unreasonable quarrel and intended to provoke, so they ignored it. The Japanese soldiers left in anger. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that on the evening of the 12th, passengers disembarking from the 102nd train on the Beining Railway in Qinhuangdao were subjected to inspection by the local Japanese army. According to a report from the local Chamber of Commerce, the Japanese army purchased 1,000 sets of Chinese clothing on the 11th and used Japanese people to wear them for photos. The intention is unclear. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Defense of Jinzhou is Tense; the Japanese Army in Shenyang is Advancing Westward</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: The Japanese artillery who have occupied the Juliao River in Shenyang began to advance westward on foot since the 13th.

<h3>U.S. Representative Dawes Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>The United States hopes that the Kellogg-Briand Pact will take effect and plans not to formally participate in the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>(Paris) U.S. Ambassador to the UK General Dawes arrived in Paris today from London as the League of Nations Council meeting is approaching. According to his statement to people, the United States will not formally participate in the Council's latest efforts to mediate the Liaoning case. Therefore, the U.S. government and he both expect that it may not be necessary to attend the Council meeting. However, they hope to make necessary contacts with all parties to exert all our influence to support the Council in eliminating war and ensuring that the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not fail. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) U.S. Ambassador to the UK Dawes met with Briand this morning to discuss the Dong Province issue. Afterwards, he telegraphed the Secretary of State Stimson about the conversation. Subsequently, Briand also met with Soviet Russian Ambassador Duglaiwskis. It is heard that Briand focused on the necessity for the Soviet Union to maintain neutrality and expressed concern about the possibility of smuggling military supplies into Heilongjiang. (14th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) What kind of attitude the United States will take in this League of Nations Administrative Council meeting has become a matter of speculation among people in Geneva. The news of Dawes' long talk with Briand this morning has also caused various rumors. Since the last Administrative Council meeting, the situation has obviously changed, which is caused by the United States not attending the Administrative Council meeting. However, since Dawes and Gilbart are both in Paris, if the Administrative Council needs to consult them, the two will be happy to discuss everything. People in the League of Nations believe that the United States now intends to act as a "faithful broker," like Bismarck's position at the Berlin Conference in 1878. Today, Japan sent another telegram to the League of Nations Secretariat, saying that Chinese troops were heavily gathered at Nenjiang, and the situation was becoming more dangerous. At the same time, Chinese General Representative Dr. Shi also reported to the Secretariat about the Japanese army's seizure of salt tax. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British and French Figures Advocate Organizing an International Army to Maintain Order in Dong Province</h3>
<p>(Paris) Professor of the French Academy and member of the Research Institute, Mr. Hadamar, published a letter saying that it is still unknown whether the League of Nations and various civilized nations can remedy the uneasy situation in Manchuria. What is known is that the League of Nations and various civilized nations have not been accustomed to facing various problems squarely, nor have they been able to observe them with the currently prevailing international thinking. Mr. Ha's intention is that all member states of the League of Nations that are not related to the Sino-Japanese dispute should allocate a part of their troops to be commanded by the League of Nations and maintain order in the places where the turmoil occurs. Once understanding is reached and the turmoil subsides, the mission of this international army will be completed and ordered to withdraw. Mr. Ha also said that the French League for Human Rights has already made this resolution. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London The Times newspaper's editorial this morning suggested a strategy to solve the Manchuria problem, saying that banditry is rampant in Manchuria, and the Japanese seem to be cooperating with the League of Nations in some police powers outside its railway area. Since Japan believes that it is justified, there is no reason to refuse cooperation with the League of Nations. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Important Domestic News 3</p>
<h3>The Future of the League of Nations is Bleak; An Agreement May Be Reached, But It Will Not Be Satisfactory; Japan Opposes a Formal Committee Inspection</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva believes today that an agreement can be hoped for, but it is not large in scope and cannot meet China's expectations. After Briand and Dawes meet tomorrow, a glimmer of hope can continue to be seen. Since U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has said that Japan's attitude is moderate, and Deputy Secretary of State Cassell has also mentioned a compromise that can be accepted by both parties, it is expected that the U.S. government must have a more satisfactory solution. If Briand's proposal to send neutral people to Manchuria for inspection is not carried out, it would be truly strange. Japan's reply to Briand's request to stop the invasion stated that in Japan's reply on November 8, it stated that the Japanese army near the Nenjiang Bridge had been instructed not to expand military operations if the Chinese army did not engage in hostile acts. However, what should be seriously noted now is that Chinese troops ten times the size of the Japanese army are gathered in the areas of Qiqihar, Ang'angxi, and south of these two places, which poses a serious danger to the Japanese army, and the degree of this danger is constantly increasing. The Japanese representative has repeatedly stated this situation to the Administrative Council. The Japanese government, in accordance with Article 7 of the September 30 resolution, will continue to provide the Administrative Council with extremely detailed information. Since the beginning of the current incident, the Japanese government has been willing to provide the greatest convenience within its power to those who are attending the Administrative Council meetings who are going to Manchuria to investigate the truth. The Japanese government's attitude has not changed to this day. Since Japan is now promising to give the greatest convenience to the people going to Manchuria, its previous opposition to a formal inspection team has been reduced. Regarding this level, the League of Nations and Japan can easily get closer. Once representatives of the great powers conduct on-site inspections, the crisis of expanding the war should be avoided. This is one of the reasons why Geneva is slightly optimistic today. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, news came from Europe that Japan had indicated that it was willing to have the League of Nations send a committee to investigate the truth in Manchuria. This question was heard, and it was greatly surprised. The Japanese are now clarifying that the convenience that Japan has allowed is for individual inspectors, not a formal committee. Japan is opposed to the proposal to send a formal committee to Manchuria for investigation. The reason for the surprise is due to a private telegram sent by the Foreign Minister to French Foreign Minister Briand yesterday. It is now heard that the military attachés of the British, American, and Soviet Russian embassies in Tokyo, after completing their observation of the exercises in Kyushu, are scheduled to go to Manchuria on November 19 to investigate everything. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Petit Parisian newspaper published details of a method to resolve the Manchuria case, stating that this plan was secretly discussed at the Administrative Council meeting in Geneva in October and has now received very serious attention. The first part has been approved by the Tokyo authorities, and the second part is currently under consideration. This plan will develop under the management of an inspection committee organized by foreign military attachés stationed in Japan, and related negotiations will be held simultaneously in Manchuria and Europe. The negotiations in Manchuria will deal with local and administrative issues and will be conducted by the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army and the Chinese authorities. They will discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops and China's guarantee of the safety of Japanese people. The negotiations in Europe will deal with Japan's five basic points. The Petit Parisian newspaper also said that if this plan is accepted, both parties can undertake to complete their negotiations within a considerable time limit. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London The British Quaker Council sent a letter to the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, hoping that the British government would help the League of Nations resolve the Manchuria issue.

<p>London MacDonald's son, Malcolm MacDonald, now Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, gave a speech at the Labor Club at Oxford University today, mentioning the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting held in Paris. He said that this meeting is a true test of the League of Nations. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, the League of Nations' credibility will be lost. If the organization for peaceful resolution is destroyed, a major war will occur, which will not be limited to Manchuria. Japan will also send troops to China to destroy its boycott movement, and Russia, the United States, Britain, and France will also consider their positions. If they allow the war to proceed in Manchuria, the era of 1914 will return. China now trusts the League of Nations. If the League of Nations fails to live up to its trust, China will turn to Russia for help. If so, communism will inevitably flourish in North China, which is something that most people in the world do not want to see. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Sino-Japanese negotiations are still the event that is most closely watched by official circles and political circles in Berlin. In view of the importance of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting in Paris on Sunday, the German government decided to send cabinet member Blow as a representative of Germany to participate in the meeting. Because German Chancellor and Foreign Minister Brüning must stay in Berlin to handle the Franco-German indemnity negotiations and cannot go far for the time being. When the German Administrative Council meets, it will strive to find a satisfactory solution to end the Sino-Japanese incident. Germany has no political relations in Manchuria. Now that this issue has been submitted to the League of Nations again, Germany's main purpose is to maintain the credibility of the League of Nations. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Shi Zhaoji Reports to the League of Nations that Japan has Violated its Promises and Attacked Jiangqiao without Declaring War</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Chinese General Representative Shi forwarded to the Council a telegram from Heilongjiang Acting Chairman General Ma Zhanshan, stating that the Japanese have not formally declared war in the Three Eastern Provinces but have taken military action. He requested the Council to send neutral inspectors to the site to investigate the truth. It also stated that Japanese cavalry and artillery have attacked Chinese cavalry, and the war is in progress. According to reliable reports, the Japanese army has transported two more cannons to the Nenjiang Bridge in preparation for bombing the Chinese army. In view of various facts, the Japanese's intention to besiege Qiqihar, occupy it, and seize political power is obvious. On the 8th of this month, Japan assured the Council that the Japanese army would stop advancing after occupying Dasing and that reinforcements had been stopped, etc. Now its military action is nothing short of a breach of promise. Furthermore, the Japanese promised that the advance to Jiangqiao was purely to protect the bridge repair, which is also inconsistent with Honjo's actions. Before transmitting this telegram, Shi had reported Honjo's message of condolences to the United States and the situation of the Japanese cavalry and artillery attack to the Council. At the same time, the Japanese representative also sent the Japanese government's reply to Briand to the Council. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Shi Zhaoji today, stating that the Japanese army has increased its strength and is scheduled to occupy Heiyuan before the 16th in order to support Zhang HaiPeng's independence.

<h3>Harbin Headquarters Captures Japanese Spy, Confesses to Attempting to Disrupt Northern Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Beiping telegram received by a certain agency, the Harbin-Manchuria Headquarters captured a White Russian, Vosagoff, a Japanese spy, on the 9th. He possessed temporary residence permit No. 903 from the Special Police Department. He confessed that he was under Japanese command and organized an intelligence agency in the Amur Province. The organization's department was in Shanghai, and the branch was at 18 Vyacheslavskaya Street, Pianlianzi, Harbin, attempting to disrupt Northern Manchuria. It was planned to have 18 White Russians in Harbin. Among those traveling with him this time were Shao Logenda Zhongwale, who disembarked at Angangxi to go to Jiang Province. The purpose was to transmit information, investigate whether Soviet Russia was secretly assisting the Chinese army, and the relationship between the Chinese army and the Japanese situation, and to severely monitor Soviet military activities. There were approximately 3,000 Japanese plainclothes troops lurking in Harbin, who would be given rifles and horses to White Russians when necessary to invade Northern Manchuria. Furthermore, a handwritten note from Bubu, a Japanese national in Harbin, to Ueda, a Manchurian station worker, dated the 7th, was found on the suspect's person, which read: "Thank you for your efforts. In this autumn of national survival, I deeply pray for your struggle. The six battalions of infantry of the Nenjiang army occupied Tangchi on the 7th, about 41 li south of Angangxi, with 80 killed and wounded. The Heilongjiang army retreated near the south side of the Dongtie railway line. Are you safe? Please inform me of the situation in your area and send someone back to Harbin quickly. Travel expenses to return to Harbin have been issued." (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to news from Beiping received by local newspapers, yesterday the Chinese authorities arrested a Russian named Ushakov in Manzhouli, who claimed to be a White Russian soldier and was associated with the Harbin Japanese Military Committee. The committee had dispatched its members to disrupt the Chinese Eastern Railway and communicate with Mongolian bandits to prepare for a rebellion against Russia. TASS reported that the Chinese authorities would soon publish Ushakov's confession. It was reported that several documents were found on Ushakov's person, including a letter from the Harbin Japanese Military Committee to the Japanese military authorities in Manzhouli. Moscow newspapers also stated that, according to reliable Chinese sources in Harbin, the Japanese military commander is now sending officers to the Soviet-Russian border to collect guns and ammunition manufactured by Soviet factories and issued to Russian soldiers during the Sino-Soviet conflict in 1929. The Japanese intend to use this waste as evidence that Soviet Russia is secretly assisting the Chinese army, claiming it was picked up in Qiqihar. A representative of the Japanese authorities in Shenyang stated that Chinese and Korean communists in the Amur and Heihe areas are now heading south to receive military supplies at the Angangxi station. Today, TASS mentioned this matter, stating that responsible parties pointed out that this claim was a fabricated provocation by the Japanese from beginning to end. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Citizens' Assembly Urges Government to Increase Troops in Dong Province</h3>
<p>Tokyo The Minseito party, the Seiyukai party, and fifteen other representative groups held a citizens' assembly this afternoon to discuss the Manchurian issue. In domestic politics, the Minseito party supports the government, while the Seiyukai party opposes the government. However, on the Manchurian issue, both parties are unanimously against foreign countries. 50,000 participants passed a resolution urging the League of Nations to reconsider its previous stance and demanding that the fundamental solution to the Manchurian dispute should be achieved through direct negotiations between China and Japan. They also opposed foreign interference and pressure and urged the government to send more troops to Manchuria due to the tense situation in Tianjin, Qiqihar, and other places. The resolution has been telegraphed to important figures such as US President Hoover and French Foreign Minister Briand. Recently, thousands of Japanese people have been visiting the Meiji Mausoleum daily to pray for the spirit of Emperor Meiji in heaven to bring about a victorious result to this national crisis.

<h3>Regarding the Tianjin Riot Incident, China Protests to Japan, Asserting the Japanese Government Bears Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Tianjin riot incident, the Chinese government has lodged a protest with Japan. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>For the purpose of notification, it has been found that since the night of November 8th, a large group of rioters in plainclothes suddenly emerged from the Japanese concession in Tianjin, using rifles, pistols, and hand grenades to attack Chinese government agencies, occupy the telephone bureau, and police stations near the Japanese concession. In order to maintain local security, the Chinese authorities immediately ordered nearby security teams and police to take necessary defensive measures. At that time, the rioters arbitrarily used weapons, causing bullets to fly in all directions. Simultaneously, bullets from the Japanese concession also flew into Chinese-administered territory. In this chaotic situation, many Chinese police and civilians were killed and wounded. Just as the rioters' offensive was slightly suppressed, the Japanese commander in Tianjin suddenly and firmly demanded that the Chinese authorities order the Chinese police and security teams to withdraw 300 meters, otherwise he would take free action. To avoid conflict, the Chinese side ordered a withdrawal. Unexpectedly, after the withdrawal, about 30 artillery shells suddenly fired from the Japanese concession into Chinese territory. Inspection of the shells revealed that they were manufactured in Taisho 15 (1926). Most of the other firearms obtained were made in Japan. The arrested rioters confessed that they were issued large rifles, automatic pistols, small pistols, and hand grenades under the supervision of several Japanese, and were given 40 yuan in cash per person. The Japanese concession authorities have completely violated the principles of peaceful commerce and are now using the concession as a source of conspiracies, allowing rioters to depart from the concession into Chinese-administered territory, disrupting security, attacking Chinese government agencies, killing and wounding people, and endangering the safety of foreign residents. The weapons they carried originated from the Japanese side. The Chinese local authorities have repeatedly protested to the Japanese concession authorities without effect. Therefore, the Japanese government bears full responsibility for the Tianjin incident. The Chinese government reserves the right to make appropriate demands. While the Chinese government was preparing a written protest, it received a note from Your Excellency, the Ambassador, on November 12, requesting the withdrawal of Chinese military police beyond the distance stipulated in the exchange of notes regarding the return of Tianjin in 1902 during the Guangxu era. There are no Chinese troops near the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, and all police and security teams are not within the scope of the exchange of notes. Regarding this, the Chinese government believes that in the event of an emergency that cannot be suppressed by the police and security teams, the Chinese government may need to dispatch troops to protect the safety of Chinese and foreign people, which is not inconsistent with the spirit of the aforementioned exchange of notes. However, in this incident, in order to maintain local security and protect the safety of Chinese and foreign people, the Chinese government only ordered the police and security teams to do their best to resist the rioters. For several days, local order has been fortunately maintained, as witnessed by foreign residents. These police and security teams will continue to fulfill their responsibilities and perform their duties. It should be requested to your government to promptly order the Japanese concession authorities in Tianjin to stop all acts of violence. If the above-mentioned situation occurs again, the Japanese government should still bear full responsibility. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Cables Shi Zhaoji to Refute Japanese Reports Regarding the Jiang Province Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Shi Zhaoji, the representative of the League of Nations, to refute the Japanese representative's notification to the Council of the League of Nations regarding the Jiang Province incident, stating that all sections did not conform with the facts. The Nenjiang Bridge belongs to the Tao'ang railway line, and the right to repair it still belongs to Tao'ang. The Japanese army must order the South Manchurian Railway to repair it, which is actually to facilitate Zhang's army to attack again. On October 28, Hayashi Yoshihide, a major representing Honjo Shigeru, the commander of the Kwantung Army, met with the provincial authorities through Shimizu Kai, the Japanese consul in Heilongjiang, requesting that our side repair the bridge within seven days, otherwise the Japanese side would send troops to protect the workers to repair it. It was agreed that the Taonan Railway Bureau would repair it itself. On November 2, Major Hayashi suddenly sent a second notice, demanding that our army retreat ten kilometers, and he would carry out the bridge repair by force. An official statement was immediately made that the Japanese side's repairs to the bridge and the Japanese side's dispatch of troops to Jiang Province could not be fundamentally recognized. However, in order to respect the League of Nations' resolution and avoid conflict, our army stationed at Daxing Station was 18 li away from the Jiang Bridge. However, if the Japanese army still attacks, it will have to defend itself. It can be seen that three days ago, the Chinese and Japanese sides were still in the negotiation period, so how could our army have crossed its garrison 18 li away and shot at them? On the morning of the 3rd at 1:00 AM, the Japanese army and air force suddenly advanced from the Jiang Bridge and fired at our positions and threw grenades. On the morning of the 4th, they attacked our army again and captured three sentries. Our side sent personnel accompanied by consulate staff to negotiate, but to no avail. The Japanese side verbally demanded on the same day before noon to occupy Daxing. Daxing is far from the Jiang Bridge and has no repair workers. The Japanese representative's statement that troops were sent to Daxing to protect the workers is extremely inconsistent. On the afternoon of the 4th, the Japanese side attacked fiercely with a large army mixed with bandits, as our side did not allow Daxing, which continued until the 5th and 6th. The situation of their attack on our army has been recorded and witnessed by the British Vice Consul, Scot, and the American Counselor, Dinwiddie, and the British Vice Counselor, Frazier, and British journalists who came to Jiang one after another for on-site inspections. Our army retreated to Sanjianfang on the 6th because it was too pressured by their army. Hayashi sent the third and fourth notices between 2:00 and 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, demanding that Chairman Ma immediately retreat and hand over power to Zhang Hai Peng, which clearly showed their intention to advance troops.

<h3>Capital Anti-Japanese Association Refutes Japanese Fallacies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent a telegram to the whole country, recognizing that the five basic principles proposed by Japan are all absurd and outrageous, and refuting them separately as follows: (1) Both sides shall mutually eliminate policies and actions of aggression. Our country has always advocated peace and has never had the intention to invade other countries, let alone policies and actions. The so-called mutual elimination, coming from the Japanese, has already admitted that they have policies and actions of aggression. (2) Respect for the territorial integrity of China. The territorial integrity of China is what our Chinese people should swear to protect with their lives. Japan has repeatedly raised troops to seize territory. Now that they claim to respect the territorial integrity of China, they should abide by the resolution of the League of Nations, quickly withdraw troops, and return the lands of Liaoning and Jilin. (3) Both sides shall thoroughly eliminate organized movements that could hinder freedom of commerce or incite international hatred. This point clearly refers to our Anti-Japanese Association. However, our people's movement is a voluntary organization of the people, and no one can interfere, let alone eliminate it. It would be extremely absurd to consider reporting the facts to the League of Nations as incitement. (4) Effective protection of the peaceful businesses of Japanese residents in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces. Our country protects all foreign residents in China equally, while Japan alone proposes to protect Japanese residents in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces, not knowing what their intentions are. (5) Respect for Japan's treaty rights in the Three Eastern Provinces. All treaties that have been signed through legal procedures and with the consent of both parties should naturally be respected before they are formally abolished. In other words, treaties that have been repealed, treaties that have not been signed through legal procedures or with the consent of both parties, and secret treaties signed by one or two private individuals should not be considered as current treaties.

<h3>Soviet Russia Strongly Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Moscow on the 14th, stating that it was reported in Shenyang that there were 300 Chinese and Korean communists and other red party members in the Heihe area, and 200 red party members in the Upper Amur area, heading south, and that they had obtained firearms at the Angangxi West Station. The Soviet official has denied this, saying that if this matter was spread by the Japanese authorities in Shenyang, it is entirely a provocative lie with no basis whatsoever. In fact, this kind of rumor-mongering should only be regarded as a trick by bandits to confuse people in order to cover up their true illegal actions. (14th Special Telegram)</p>

(14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Tianfang, Liu Zhi, He Yingqin, and 133 others proposed to the Fourth Plenary Session that all delegates stand to mourn for three minutes to express their respect for the soldiers and civilians who died in the Japanese invasion of the Three Eastern Provinces, and to designate September 18 as the National Humiliation Memorial Day of the Republic of China. The original proposal is as follows: This time, Japan violated justice and humanity, disregarded international law and conventions, and took advantage of our natural disasters to brazenly send troops to occupy the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. Since September 18, our soldiers and civilians, motivated by righteous indignation, have sacrificed their lives for the country. Although the exact number is unknown, they are numerous. At the beginning of the General Assembly, we should express our sorrow and respect for the compatriots who died for the country. This Japanese atrocity is a great shame for our country, which should be remembered forever. Therefore, the General Assembly should designate it as the National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the method of commemoration should be detailed by the Fourth Central Executive Committee. Whether it is appropriate, please vote. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Tianfang, Liu Zhi, He Yingqin, Zhu Shaoliang, Xiong Shihui, and 84 others proposed to send a telegram of condolence in the name of the General Assembly to Ma Zhanshan, acting chairman of Heilongjiang, and the Heilongjiang military generals. The original proposal is as follows: Japan brazenly sent troops to occupy our two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, which was not enough, and again in the beginning of the month supported traitorous bandits to attack Heilongjiang. Ma Zhanshan, acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and his subordinate generals and soldiers, were loyal and courageous, fighting alone and shedding blood, and were able to defeat the strong enemy and defend the territory. It is appropriate for the General Assembly to send a telegram of condolence to reward loyalty and righteousness and to encourage others. Whether it is appropriate, please vote.

<h3>Finance and Economy Committees Decide to Work Together to Discuss Fundamental Construction Plans; Both Committees to be Established Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Council is scheduled to hold its establishment meeting at the National Government at 2:00 PM on the 15th to discuss national economic planning.

<h3>The Indian Round Table Conference Concludes, Difficulties Remain in the Minority Agreement</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th – The Round Table Conference has essentially concluded today because Indian representatives failed to agree on a solution to the minority issue. In his last effort to avoid a breakdown, British Prime Minister MacDonald asked representatives of various minorities to sign their requests and submit them to the Prime Minister, requesting a solution to this problem and declaring their willingness to accept the Prime Minister's decision. Although some representatives agree with this proposal, unanimous consent may not be possible. If an agreement cannot be reached, the British government will have to solve this problem itself and draft a constitution for India.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke to the Minority Committee of the Indian Round Table Conference today, deeply regretting that a complete agreement could not be reached. He said that the agreement on the right to participate in politics in the Indian Parliament for various minorities, proposed by Muslims and oppressed classes and other minorities, will be included in the official record for future consideration. The Prime Minister also said that the government will issue a formal statement in a few days to express the British government's sincerity in seeking happiness for India.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 14th – After the news of the establishment of the Muslim and Minority Agreement spread, it was generally hoped that the township issue could be resolved within the Minority Committee in the morning. In fact, it was not possible due to the opposition of the Sikh representatives. Gandhi may depart for India within a week. Before his departure, MacDonald may convene a committee to resolve the unresolved issues.</p>
<h3>The Franco-German Economic Committee is Established</h3>
<p>Four Subcommittees Organized to Discuss Separately</p>
<p>Guomin, Paris, 13th – The Franco-German Economic Committee was formally established in the French capital today. The chairman is the French Minister of Economy, Mr. Gignoux, and the vice-chairman is the Permanent Secretary of the German Ministry of Economy, Mr. Trendelenburg. Mr. Gignoux and Mr. Trendelenburg will take turns chairing the conference, but because all important matters have been assigned to the subcommittees and allowed to discuss them automatically, the number of conferences is feared to be extremely small. When the founding meeting was held today, French Prime Minister Laval personally delivered a congratulatory speech. After the opening ceremony, both parties engaged in the agenda of the various subcommittees. The main outline was predetermined in advance. There are four subcommittees, the most important of which is the committee discussing the Franco-German Commercial Treaty. According to the current situation, the opinions of Germany and France on the commercial treaty are still far apart. The French side is extremely dissatisfied with the current commercial rules between the two countries, saying that the depression of French commerce is due to this. Although various restrictions have been added by the French side, the balance of trade cannot still be maintained. On the German side, the various restrictions imposed by the French side are considered unfair, saying that if German industry does not have the opportunity to naturally develop foreign markets, Germany will have no way to cope with all external debts. The other three subcommittees have lighter tasks, one of which is dedicated to discussing the aviation industry in Europe and North and South America.</p>
<h3>The Great Article Returns Long Four Three Seven Five</h3>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>The Manilla telegram appeals to the Ningyue Fourth Plenary Session, all representatives, the Nanjing Central Party Department, the National Government, Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beiping, Taiyuan, leaders of all parties, national military and political chiefs, and all officers and soldiers: Internal divisions have led to foreign aggression. Now the country is in imminent danger. All parties should prioritize national salvation and resistance against Japan, immediately abandon the struggle for power and private interests, and realize unity. Soldiers should use their one life and one bullet to defend the country. Politicians and diplomats should not betray the country with their every word and deed, nor give the violent Japanese an excuse for propaganda. The patriotic movement is deeply feared by the violent Japanese and is the only chance for survival in our country. Do not stop it arbitrarily and cut off the path to survival. November 16th is approaching in an instant. The central government should instruct the whole country to make practical preparations. All parties should work together. If the violent Japanese stubbornly resist international public opinion and refuse to withdraw their troops, then the whole country, from top to bottom, should use all its strength to drive the Japanese bandits out of the country, maintain international public opinion, and protect the integrity of the national territory, so that the world knows that the non-resistance since September is due to our country's respect for justice and not fear of death and humiliation. This time, General Ma Zhanshan and his officers and soldiers fought bravely against the Japanese. Overseas Chinese believe that this embodies the spirit of the Premier and the martyrs. World public opinion has also realized that China has soldiers who bravely defend their territory. All officers and soldiers in our country should urgently repent of the shameful sacrifice of internal war and follow Ma's troops to be the first to kill the enemy. Leaders of all parties should also repent of the mistakes of private struggles that have harmed the country throughout history. If they do not realize and atone for their sins, even if they declare justice, they will not only not be valued by the people of the country, but the Premier, if he knows in the afterlife, will also regard them as traitors. 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines are thoroughly boycotting Japanese goods and remitting funds to directly support Ma Zhanshan. We hope that the central government will not sit idly by and watch Ma's troops fight alone and provide immediate relief. If leaders of all parties can faithfully serve the country and strive against Japan, overseas Chinese will resolutely support them. If they are stubborn and do not wake up, they should be regarded as Li Wan Yong and Zhang Bangchang and abandoned by the whole country. The Philippine Chinese National Salvation Association, the General Chamber of Commerce, and various groups kowtow and urge.</p>

<h3>Rioters Commanded by Japanese Haven't Stopped Disturbing Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the evening of the 8th, the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have secretly directed plainclothes teams to create disturbances around the Chinese concession, which has not stopped until now. This morning (12th), at about 1:00 AM, the plainclothes team split into two groups and attacked Chinese territory in the Nankai Xiatou and Nankai areas, with Japanese armored vehicle teams covering the advance from behind. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. The 15th, 16th, 18th, and 24th squadrons of the security team tried their best to resist. The situation of the French Bridge in Tianjin checking pedestrians</p>
<p>Fought fiercely for a long time. It wasn't until dawn that the plainclothes team retreated to the Japanese concession. It is reported that the leader of the plainclothes team, Li Jichun, recently gathered four or five hundred local bandits and ruffians in the Beicang area, giving each person a resettlement fee of eight yuan, a pistol, and twelve bullets, which were issued by the Japanese by name. They are still preparing to expand the riots. Scattered plainclothes teams are often found in various parts of the Chinese concession today, in groups of two or five or six or seven. Zhang Bi personally went to the East-West Road this morning to inspect the hand grenades used by the plainclothes team, which had the words "Taisho 15th Year."</p>
<p>Command, so today, starting at 2:00 PM, the Chinese concession and the three special areas are all under curfew. Anyone is not allowed to pass, to prevent the plainclothes team from mixing in.</p>
<p>The local authorities in this city believe that the disturbances by the plainclothes team are obviously instigated by the Japanese to achieve their conspiracy to destroy North China. They have to take strict precautions. For several days, soil bags have been piled up in all important places in the Chinese concession, and security teams are stationed there. The Hebei area, where provincial and municipal organs are located, is under more severe alert. From the Jingang Bridge in front of the provincial government to the new station, the armored vehicles discarded by the plainclothes team are found along the avenue.</p>

<p>Li, except for public officials who can pass during commuting hours, all other people have not been allowed to pass since the 9th (Ermalu and Sanmalu can barely pass). Only Simalu and Wumalu are allowed to open for a few hours in the morning, so that residents can buy food. By evening, there is no trace of anyone. Dongmalu is close to the Japanese concession and is a severely worse area for thugs to haunt. Residents of each small alley also voluntarily piled up stone walls to prevent the plainclothes team from entering. The Tianjin security team has more than 10,000 people. They have fought fiercely with the plainclothes team for several days. According to the authorities, if the Japanese army does not openly help the chaos, the power of these thousands of plainclothes teams and security teams is enough to solve it. Chinese and foreign merchants and people in Tianjin have been greatly affected by the Japanese army directing plainclothes teams to harass them. Yesterday morning, Chinese and foreign chambers of commerce held an informal meeting at the Banking Association in the British Concession to discuss measures and decided to send a telegram to the League of Nations to uphold justice and quickly stop the Japanese military's atrocities. On the one hand, they also telegraphed the envoys stationed in Beiping, requesting them to instruct the consuls of their respective countries stationed in Tianjin to inform the troops of their respective countries to form a buffer zone at the border between China and Japan and closely monitor it to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. Now, except for the Japanese concession, which has been under curfew day and night and has completely become a wartime state, the French concession, due to the large number of refugees, also implemented a curfew at 9:00 PM last night to prevent unscrupulous people from mixing in. The British concession can still be accessed all night, but everyone is in danger and dare not go out. By about 8:00 or 9:00 PM, there are few pedestrians. Now, the plainclothes teams captured in Tianjin all have yellow and blue-bordered white badges.</p>
<p>The most painful thing is the people's food problem. Due to the cut off transportation, there is no way to transport, and everything is expensive, causing panic. These phenomena are almost unprecedented in the past ten years of war. (November 12)</p>
<h3>Evidence of the Japanese Invasion and Occupation of Land in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Large-scale Activities of Agricultural Companies under the Guidance of the Japanese Government</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the Japanese army forcibly occupied the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, all administrative organs were occupied, and all seals and files fell into their hands. In addition to extorting people's wealth and plundering taxes, the Japanese also forged land deeds and mining licenses, secretly stamped seals, and filled in the dates in reverse order in an attempt to seize them. The landlords regarding the transfer of land and the four boundaries of the maps can be copied in detail according to the case because there are files to check. Moreover, the Liaoning Agricultural and Mining Department is now working under the direction of the Japanese, and is taking this opportunity to issue mining licenses at will. It can be seen that the land and mineral rights in the Northeast will be lost without exception. Recently, the so-called Showa Agricultural Company is an organized land invasion agency under the guidance of the Japanese government. A few days ago, it sent more than 2,000 copies of letters claiming to occupy land in Shenyang. For example, seven or eight villages, including Xize Guantun, Huang Guitun, Maquanzi, Xiadianzi, Goulian Tun, and Niu Xintun in the west of Shencheng, received this letter on the 31st of last month, with the name Showa Agricultural Company, 16th Kotohira-cho, Mukden Japanese Station (original photo as above). Its intention to forcibly occupy our country's land is clearly visible. The farmers in each village were shocked after receiving this letter, and are now uniting the villages to plot resistance.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>A tragic case of patricide occurred in the city. Shen Xingeng, the eldest son of the late rich man Shen Baiqing in Qixiang, District 1 of this county, has a wife and a concubine. He is deeply addicted to morphine and likes to spend money, which has led to the destruction of hundreds of acres of paternal inheritance. His stepmother, Yang Miaoying, is the sister of Yang Zhishan, the late chairman of the county chamber of commerce. There are still more than 400 acres of official farmland. Xingeng often asked for it. Mrs. Yang was overwhelmed, so she moved to Shen Yingli's residence in the west gate of the city to avoid it two years ago. However, Xingeng still harassed her when he was in difficulty. Recently, Mrs. Yang has not given much to Xingeng's insatiable demands. Xingeng held an unusual grudge. On the morning of the 12th of this month, Xingeng rushed to Mrs. Yang's place. Mrs. Yang saw that the situation was turbulent and feared that it would be unfavorable, so she tried to avoid it. She was dragged and took out a sharp knife, stabbing it randomly. Mrs. Yang cried out in pain. The landlord's young master, Shen Siguan, ran out when he heard the sound and saw Mrs. Yang fainted, with blood flowing like a river. He quickly dragged Xingeng and Xingeng struggled to escape. Siguan blew the police whistle wildly. When the neighbors heard it, they immediately went to help and captured Xingeng. Three letters were also found beside him, one to the county magistrate and one to his cousin, Yang Zhaoshi, the current district chief of this county. The two letters were roughly the same, saying that he had suffered from the stepmother for a long time, so he decided to kill her. One was a suicide note, saying that he had a grudge with his stepmother in his previous life, so he killed her. I will also swallow mercury at the same time to commit suicide. If the poison does not work, I am willing to go to the execution ground to pay for my life, etc. Shen Yang was immediately taken to the public hospital for treatment. After examination, it was found that there were three knives on his back, one knife in his waist, one knife in his throat, and one knife in his left eye. The eyeball was also picked out, which was very tragic. He then died. The county magistrate was reported to conduct an autopsy and confirmed that he had died from serious injuries. Shen Xingeng was taken to the county for interrogation. However, the face of the criminal was pale and his spirit was depressed, as if he had taken poison. He ordered the police to send him to the public hospital for treatment before further verification.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Both major fraud cases are being liquidated. Li Baoshen, Zhu Ziruo, Chen Zhongli, and others from the Nantung County Finance Bureau embezzled huge sums of money during the collection of Caomang. Someone secretly reported it to the province and ordered the county to escort Li to the province on September 4 to be detained in the guard room of the Finance Bureau. The county will be ordered to escort the roots to the province for liquidation. It is reported that Li and others have levied huge amounts of money over the years. The total amount that has been calculated is no less than Liyang. However, Zheng Chengyuan and others in Liyang committed the entire fraud. Li and others embezzled in piecemeal, and the procedures were more complicated. After the complete liquidation, there must be a definite number before being transferred to the court for punishment. As for the case of Sun Baoqin, the chief engineer of the former Construction Department Highway Bureau, Shao Fengqi, the chief accountant, Lu Fangcai, the engineer, and Qin Dingqiu, the staff, who privately carved seals, fabricated reimbursements, and committed fraud, it has been investigated twice since it was transferred to the court for trial. The court is currently in liquidation, and it will take time to close the case. Sun and others will also be sued in court to recover the wages owed to the contractors.</p>

<h3>Shanxi Provincial Education Statistics</h3>
<p>Six Specialized Schools, 105 Middle Schools, and 22,400 Elementary Schools</p>
<p>(Taiyuan Correspondence) Education in Shanxi Province has been very declining in recent years. Both higher and junior elementary schools have the feeling of having schools but no people, especially women's education, which is the most desolate. The number of people who go to higher-level schools is also decreasing year by year. Taking the ratio of the past eight or nine years, during the summers of 1911, 1912, and 1913, an average of more than 10,000 to 20,000 people came to Taiyuan to apply for middle school or above. In the past two years, the number of applicants each year has been less than 2,000. The difference in the number of people is so huge, and the decline in education and the hardship of people's lives can be imagined. However, although the number of students has been declining, the number of higher-level idlers has also been increasing due to the inability of middle school and above graduates to find employment. These contradictory laws show that Shanxi education does not focus on reality or the development of vocational education. Never mind other things, just take the statistics of education in the province as an example. This work is very important to the development and decline of education, but there has been no accurate statistics to examine. Recently, since Mr. Miao Peicheng became the head of the Education Department, he seems to have determined to rectify the situation and has been very active in various tasks. The department is now engaged in preparing the educational statistics for the 18th year. Now we have obtained the statistics that have been prepared and copied them below for the reference of educators across the country.</p>
<p>Number of schools: There are 2200 elementary schools, 105 middle schools, and 6 specialized schools or above (excluding Shanxi University).</p>
<p>Number of students: There are 808,619 people in elementary schools, 12,293 people in middle schools, and 1,317 people in specialized schools or above.</p>
<p>Graduates: 87,574 people in elementary schools, 2,795 people in middle schools, and 374 people in specialized schools or above.</p>
<p>Number of teachers: 27,460 people in elementary schools, 1,057 people in middle schools, and 178 people in specialized schools or above.</p>
<p>Number of staff: 14,118 people in elementary schools, 455 people in middle schools, and 90 people in specialized schools or above.</p>
<p>School income and expenses: 3,717,409 yuan for elementary schools, 5,693,073 yuan for middle schools, and 354,377 yuan for specialized schools or above.</p>
<p>School expenditure: 3,711,803 yuan for elementary schools, 5,243,062 yuan for middle schools, and 300,020 yuan for specialized schools or above.</p>
<p>School assets: 11,278,210 yuan for elementary schools, 5,016,828 yuan for middle schools, and 535,747 yuan for specialized schools or above.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates the Status of Border Students</h3>

<h3>Preparations to Restore Zhongda Evening Business School</h3>
<p>Celebrities from All Walks of Life Encourage and Sponsor, Organizing Committee Elected on the Spot</p>
<p>Xu Peikun, Dean of the Business School of Zhongda University, in view of the needs of the situation and the requests of all sectors, decided to restore the evening school. He scheduled to hold a banquet on the 13th of this month at the Bank Association Club, inviting celebrities from all walks of life and students of the college to discuss the method of proceeding. This has been published in this newspaper. It is learned that well-known figures in Shanghai that day, such as industrialist Liu Hongsheng, banking magnate Lin Kanghou, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce President Wang Xiaolai, Education Bureau Director Xu Juntao, Commercial Press Wang Yunwu, Commodity Inspection Bureau Director Zou Bingwen, Public Works Department Consultant He Zhongliu, and students of the college Wang Zhixin, Xiong Juling, Chen Xianmo, and more than sixty others all participated in the event.

First, Liu Hongsheng gave a speech on running a business, emphasizing the need to have business knowledge. His speech was concise and comprehensive, and his words were mostly pertinent. Then, Lin Kanghou gave a speech on the situation of bank exchange. At the end, he encouraged his colleagues with the eight characters of diligence, frugality, patience, hard work, and morality. Xu Juntao then gave a speech on the various situations of running education. His words were carefully considered and his sentences were carefully worded, truly worthy of being a leader in the education sector. The most laughable was Zou Bingwen's speech. He said that running education now, with the intention of expanding the scope and consolidating our funds, and wanting to solicit donations from the outside world, is like a beggar begging. The entire audience burst into laughter. Finally, He Zhongliu gave a speech. In this era of commercial competition, if we do not rush to run evening schools and create commercial talents, I am afraid that our country will have no place to stand. For a time, he was generous and impassioned, and the listeners applauded thunderously. Then, due to time constraints, they began to discuss the organization of the preparatory committee and how the preparatory committee members would be produced. After public resolution, six people were elected from the faculty and staff, and five people were elected from the students, for a total of eleven people to form the preparatory committee for organizing the evening school. As a result, Zhang Sumin, Ji Chuying, Wu Yugan, Wang Zhixin, Yu Songhua, Xu Peikun, Chen Jingmin, Xiong Juling, Lu Xuehuan, Du Tingxuan, and Chen Xianmo were elected as preparatory committee members.

(5) The Flour Exchange telegraphed: "To General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, We admire your isolated army's resistance against the invaders, repeatedly defeating the strong enemy, glorifying the Chinese people, and strengthening our national prestige. We are specially remitting 1,500 Shanghai dollars through the Bank of China in Harbin to provide some comfort. We dare not call it encouragement, but we ask you to accept it first. We will continue to remit funds in the future and hope you will defend our homeland with courage and determination. The fate of the country rests on you, and your name will be immortalized in history. We urge you to strive on, General. Sincerely, the colleagues of the Shanghai Flour Exchange."

We are remitting 1,000 yuan to express our sincere condolences. We hope you will continue your efforts and vow to be your strong support. Sincerely, the Shanghai Postal Workers Union and Postal Workers Association." (7) The Coal Industry Association held an emergency meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday and resolved to quickly remit 2,000 yuan to support Chairman Ma's military expenses and encourage morale. They also sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to combine the funds for remittance to Heilongjiang.

We have raised 300 yuan and are remitting it by telegraph to express our support. We will continue to collect funds in the future and remit them by telegraph. We hope you will continue your efforts. Sincerely, all teachers, students, and staff of the Shanghai Minzhi Elementary and Middle School." (10) All colleagues of the Shanghai Radio Station are initiating a fundraising effort to comfort Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province, who is defending the country and vowing to resist the enemy to the death. It is reported that they are currently telegraphing the Harbin Radio Station to inquire whether it is possible to telegraph the consolation money. It is also reported that the colleagues are voluntarily donating and have already collected several hundred yuan, which will be remitted as soon as the collection is completed. (11) The First District Branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizens Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday and resolved to allocate 1,000 yuan from the donation for the establishment of a volunteer army to remit to General Ma Zhanshan as a consolation fund. They first telegraphed to inquire, with the telegram stating: "To General Ma Zhanshan of Qiqihar, We admire you for leading a small force to repel the Japanese soldiers, who were in high spirits. Your hand-to-hand combat at Jiangqiao is awe-inspiring. Your defense of the country is admired by the entire nation. Although the colleagues of our association are thousands of miles away and unable to follow you, we feel it is our duty to provide support. We plan to remit a small amount of money by telegraph as consolation. Please telegraph back the location for receiving the money. Sincerely, the First District Branch of the Shanghai Nanjing Road Citizens Association." They also designated the Sincere and Wing On companies as collection points for consolation money. If people from all walks of life are willing to donate, they can directly donate to these two companies. Once a sufficient amount is collected, the association will remit it to Heilongjiang Province to alleviate the national crisis.</p>
<p>Public Notice from the Chamber of Commerce Soliciting Donations The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice yesterday to solicit donations to aid General Ma Zhanshan, stating: "To whom it may concern, Liaoning and Jilin have fallen for nearly two months. Fortified cities and sharp weapons have all been used to aid the enemy. However, Ma Zhanshan, Acting Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and Brigade Commander, with a few thousand soldiers, has resisted the fierce invaders. The Battle of Nenjiang greatly frustrated the enemy's arrogance, comparable to the Battle of Liangshan. After defending for several weeks, the enemy army has failed to penetrate deeply. His spirit of dedicating himself to the country is worthy of our nation's respect and should be honored as a pillar of the nation. However, Heilongjiang Province is isolated and lacks supplies. We believe that Chairman Ma is the shield of Heilongjiang Province, and we cannot bear to see him run out of food and aid and be helpless. We should rise up and enthusiastically donate funds to strengthen the morale of the soldiers at the front and achieve the effect of having well-fed soldiers and horses. The Chamber of Commerce has already raised and advanced 10,000 yuan, which will be remitted to Heilongjiang Province immediately. We hope that all sectors of society and the city's merchants will unite and do their best to raise funds to ensure the safety of Heilongjiang Province, fight for the nation's dignity, and support the fallen soldiers. All those who are alive and breathing and unwilling to surrender to the enemy should make an effort and send donations to the Finance Department of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the Tianhou Palace Bridge for collection and remittance. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Compilation of Consolation Telegrams from Various Organizations (1) The Women's National Salvation League telegraphed: "To Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, The invaders are rampant, and justice has fallen. You alone can win glory for the nation and act as a warrior without fear of death, washing away the recent cowardice of soldiers against foreign powers. Our league cannot help but offer our highest respect and vow to be your strong support. We send this telegram of comfort. Sincerely, the Women's National Salvation League." (2) The Fifth District Party Department issued a public telegram yesterday: "To all newspaper offices, We recently sent a telegram to Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province, urgently stating: 'To General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and all soldiers, We are deeply moved by your telegram stating that you are resisting the dwarfish army and winning victories. We mourn for China, which has repeatedly suffered Japanese aggression. The provinces of Liaoning and Jilin were lost in an instant due to the policy of non-resistance. Only our general and others, with a small isolated army, have resisted tens of thousands of dwarfish invaders, protecting our territory and speaking out for the people. Looking north to the mountains, we are filled with admiration. We hope you will continue to fight and eliminate these barbarians, achieving an early victory. We send this telegram of comfort. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special City Fifth District Party Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party.'" (3) The Democratic Promotion Comrades Association of the Nationalist Party telegraphed: "To the Headquarters of Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, forwarded to Acting Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province and all soldiers, We admire your courage in repeatedly defeating the Japanese invaders. Hearing the news of your victories fills us with pride. You have washed away the shame of non-resistance and set the first example of common hatred. We hope you will continue your efforts to recover the lost territory and return it to our map. You are standing tall in the Northeast, and the people admire you. Our party is eager to follow your example. We send this telegram of comfort and eagerly await your success. Sincerely, the Democratic Promotion Comrades Association of the Chinese Nationalist Party." (4) The Road Construction Association telegraphed Ma Zhanshan: "To Acting Chairman Ma of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government in Qiqihar, Since the Japanese barbarians invaded and Liaoshen fell, soldiers have obeyed the orders of non-resistance, taking surrender as the principle and fleeing as the best option. As a result, the enemy's arrogance has increased, and their brutality has intensified. Recently, they have disregarded the Non-Aggression Pact and deeply invaded Heilongjiang, shocking the entire nation and arousing the common anger of the world. Fortunately, you personally led the isolated army, resisting the fierce and arrogant Japanese invaders in hand-to-hand combat at Jiangqiao, wielding the spear of Luyang, battling on the water, and building the fortress of Han Gong, boosting the morale of the entire nation and acting as the shield of the nation. Looking north to the banners, we are filled with joy. (Omitted) We hope you will continue to fight and kill the enemy for the country, so that our territory will not be damaged and we can hope to recover our land. We will compile a register of the names of the martyrs who died in battle and send it to the association, so that we can invite various groups to initiate the erection of a monument at a scenic spot to commemorate them. Their names will be immortalized in history. Sincerely, the China National Road Construction Association." (5) The New Method Laundry Industry Association telegraphed: "To General Ma Zhanshan, Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, The Japanese barbarians are running rampant, seizing our Northeast. The high officials and senior generals have failed to defend our territory. You are ashamed of non-resistance and embrace the principle of defending the city to the death. You vow to drive out the Japanese invaders and return our borders. Tian Heng and his five hundred men forced back a thousand troops. The Japanese invaders are retreating in the wind. Your sincerity and courage are enough to move heaven and earth and make gods weep. Your actions and your person are enough to inspire the deaf and dumb and make the weak and cowardly stand up. Hearing the good news fills us with joy. We hope you will show your divine power and bravely kill the enemy. We hope that you will be the pillar supporting the crumbling house and that your name will be immortalized in history. We send this telegram of comfort and look forward to hearing more good news. Sincerely, the Shanghai New Method Laundry Industry Association and all its members." (6) The Chongshe of Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory telegraphed: "To the Shen Bao newspaper, forwarded to all sectors of the country, We recently sent a telegram to General Ma Zhanshan, stating: 'Chairman Ma, Unfortunately, our country has suffered from frequent internal strife, which has led to the Japanese barbarians' ambition to invade. Alas, our officials are retreating without fighting, offering our tens of millions of compatriots and tens of millions of miles of territory to the wolves. Only our general is weeping and shouting, personally leading the soldiers to defeat the fierce invaders. The news of your victories has spread throughout the country and filled us with joy. We offer our condolences and hope you will continue to fight. Our company is urging the government to send troops to aid you and to work together with the people to be your strong support.' We hereby send this message. Sincerely, the Chongshe of Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory."</p>

<h3>The City Party Department Telegraphed, Asking to Quickly Determine a National Salvation Plan</h3>
<p>Telegraphed to the Fourth National Congress in Nanjing Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department, considering that the Japanese invaders are increasingly intensifying their aggression against China and that our country should urgently seek a way to save itself, specially telegraphed to the Fourth National Congress in Nanjing yesterday, calling for action. The text of the telegram is as follows: "Urgent. To the Fourth National Congress in Nanjing, The brutal sun is not only disregarding the United Nations' resolution to withdraw troops by a deadline, but is also intensifying its actions, such as bombing Tongliao, attacking Heilongjiang Province, supplying bandits, intercepting salt revenues, and, more recently, disrupting Tianjin, a major transportation hub in northern and southern China, and coveting Shanghai, the financial center of southeastern China. Such lawless behavior is not only disrespectful to China, but also disregards the United Nations. Therefore, if the United Nations wants to maintain its prestige and maintain world peace, it should take effective measures to force Japan to obey. Our country, in order to seek national independence and national survival, should make the greatest determination and prepare for the worst, and should not rely solely on others and delay action. The current situation is worrying. We hereby dare to telegraph to your congress, asking you to quickly determine a major plan for self-salvation, and also request that you forward it to the National Government, urging them to quickly telegraph the United Nations, informing them that whether for the sake of international justice, world peace, or the existence of the United Nations, the United Nations must quickly sanction the brutal sun. Otherwise, the Chinese people, faced with the increasingly rampant aggression of the brutal sun, have reached a point where there is no appeal and a point where they can no longer endure. They will inevitably take the final action. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>

<h3>Details of the Tianjin Incident Obtained by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Authorities' Telegram</p>
<p>The Municipal Government received a telegram from Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming yesterday, stating: "This time, the reactionary elements secretly formed plainclothes teams to disrupt the security of Tianjin. All the details of what happened have been telegraphed to the Central Government and the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and have been sent to the city's newspapers for publication. Now, we are comprehensively reporting the details of the events before and after the incident. According to secret reports received before the incident, disgruntled military personnel Li Jichun, also known as Li Xianghe, and Zhang Bi were instructed by the Japanese to recruit more than 1,000 plainclothes team members, establishing an office at No. 6, Penglai Street, Taiping Lane, in the Japanese Concession, with Li as the commander-in-chief, planning to launch a secret riot in Tianjin on the 8th and 9th. We immediately negotiated with the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, requesting the arrest and extradition of Zhang Bi to curb the source of the trouble. The Japanese Consul agreed, but when our special agents and Japanese police went to arrest the suspect, he had already escaped in advance. We immediately notified the consuls in Tianjin of the situation and ordered the police to strengthen their vigilance. At 10:30 p.m. on the 8th, the plainclothes teams launched their planned action, first firing at us in the border areas of Caochang'an, Machang Road, Xinghua Bridge, and the Fish Market, successively occupying the Sixth Precinct of the First District and the Sixth Precinct of the Second District police stations near the Japanese Concession. After repeated attacks by the police, the plainclothes teams gradually dispersed and fled into the Japanese Concession. Our Sixth Precinct of the First District was recovered. According to the confessions of the captured plainclothes team members, the situation was the same as the secret reports. At 6:00 a.m. on the 9th, the Japanese suddenly called us, falsely claiming that our troops had attacked the plainclothes teams, injuring Japanese officers and soldiers, and demanding that we retreat 300 meters from the Japanese border, otherwise they would take free action. We informed them that we were all police and had no troops, but to avoid escalating the situation, we immediately ordered a temporary retreat. Unexpectedly, after our withdrawal, the other side suddenly fired more than 20 shells, which landed near the Public Security Bureau in Hanoi. Armored vehicles were also dispatched to attack us, intending to cover the plainclothes teams' attack. We immediately took appropriate defensive measures and questioned the Japanese Consul. The shelling immediately stopped, and fortunately, no changes occurred. It was also reported that the Japanese army had set up observation posts and military telephones on the roof of the Zhongyuan Company in the Japanese Concession. This is the general situation of the contact on the evening of the 8th and the morning of the 9th. We immediately informed the consuls in Tianjin of the situation. On the evenings of the 9th and 10th and the morning of the 10th, the plainclothes teams continued to launch attacks on the Sixth Precinct of the First District and Machang and the Beiyang Match Company in Nankai, but were all defeated. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army fired several shells at us. The shells recovered were engraved with the words 'Made in the 15th Year of Taisho,' which was the same as the hand grenades used by the captured plainclothes team members. On the evening of the 10th, the Japanese Consul and the staff officer of the Japanese army came to discuss a solution. Therefore, the situation on the evening of the 10th and the morning of the 11th was very calm. Although a few plainclothes teams were discovered, they were quickly defeated after defense. Overall, the current situation is much calmer than in the past few days. It is reported that Zhang Bi left Tianjin yesterday morning, and we are currently searching for him. These rioters will probably be resolved soon. We fear that rumors may be inaccurate, so we are reporting this by telegram."</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Trade Associations Telegraph that Tianjin is Gradually Becoming Safe</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Money Trade Association, and various banking and money trade colleagues received a telegram from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Trade Associations on the 12th, stating: "Fortunately, the local military and police in Tianjin were well-prepared and strictly guarded against the riot. The rioters were repelled for several consecutive nights and were unable to succeed. Currently, traffic in the Chinese Concession is still blocked. Except for the banks in the Concession, which are operating as usual, all money trade shops and banks in the Chinese Concession have not yet resumed business. The situation has only slightly eased since last night. Withdrawals and exchanges in the banks in the Concession are not very high. The market in Beiping is normal. However, since the Tianjin incident occurred, due to the interruption of telephone communication between Beiping and Tianjin, news has been blocked, and rumors have flourished. There has been a surge in bank withdrawals. The banks here have been shipping cash to Beiping for days to alleviate the situation. This was only seen at noon. Knowing that you are concerned from afar, we are sending this telegram to inform you. Sincerely, the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Trade Associations."</p>
<h3>More Than 160 Trade Associations' Petition Representatives Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Presenting Five Opinions and Requesting Guangdong to Adopt Them</p>
<p>More than 160 trade associations in the city, including the silk and satin industry, the money trade, the yarn industry, the cotton textile industry, the southern goods industry, and the knitting industry, have specially sent representatives Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chengqing, Zhu Wenqi, Ye Jiaxing, Xie Zhongle, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Hairuo, Lu Qisheng, Ye Chunqiao, Cai Runshen, Wang Zhefu, and Li Ruzhang to petition because the Fourth National Congress is in session. It is learned that Luo Qinghua and his party of more than 20 people have already taken the express train to Beijing last night, carrying the petition. The associations have also jointly sent a letter to Wang Jingwei, requesting that he urge the representatives of Guangdong to adopt the petition unanimously. The original petition is as follows: "Regarding the petition, your humble servants believe that the Fourth National Congress of our party is now in session, gathering talents in one hall to plan the major affairs of the party and the country. At this time of national difficulty, there must be a plan to pacify the internal and resist the external, to comfort the hopes and aspirations of the 400 million people. The more than 160 trade associations in Shanghai respectfully represent all the members, and publicly send representatives Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chengqing, Zhu Wenqi, Ye Jiaxing, Xie Zhongle, Ma Shaoquan, Lu Qisheng, Ye Chunqiao, Zheng Hairuo, Cai Runshen, Wang Zhefu, and Li Ruzhang to sincerely petition, respectfully requesting adoption, and anxiously awaiting. (1) Requesting the protection of peace, only peaceful unification can save China. When the Prime Minister was dying, he still earnestly warned us of this. Unexpectedly, in the past few years, wars and disturbances have made the people miserable. There has not been a single year without internal strife, which has created the current situation of division and separation. Recently, the progressive elements of the Beijing and Guangdong parties have had sincere unity negotiations. Therefore, in the future, they should open a situation of mutual encouragement and mutual discussion with the heart of mutual support and mutual forgetting. Even if there are differences in political views, they can be discussed openly to seek proper solutions. On the one hand, they should not follow the precedent of military remonstrance, and on the other hand, they should not hold each other hostage with force. Both parties should use this as a goal, vow to each other before the Prime Minister's portrait at the congress, and make it clear that they will keep their promises and seek the permanent protection of peaceful unification. This is the first request. (2) Requesting preparation for resisting insults, the purpose of national military force is to defend our territory and die without leaving. Ancient times had clear teachings. Unexpectedly, the brutal sun has acted so poisonously, occupying our thousands of miles of territory in one day and night with a few thousand troops, creating an unprecedented example in five thousand years of history. The officials guarding the territory are helpless, and the central government does not punish them, causing the brutal sun to become increasingly arrogant and the enemy's arrogance to grow. Now, the United Nations has resolved to withdraw troops by a deadline, which will soon arrive. If Japan refuses to comply, then what preparations should our country make? We ask that you make a decisive decision and decide on a major plan as soon as possible. If you want the soldiers to risk their lives in the future, you must first clarify rewards and punishments, distinguish right from wrong, and enforce military law impartially to strengthen military morale and boost morale. At the same time, secret contact envoys and direct negotiation advocates should be thoroughly prohibited. The central government should lead party departments at all levels across the country to intensify anti-Japanese work, and go beyond any reluctance to take action. This is the second request. (3) Requesting the suppression of bandits, the Ming Dynasty was destroyed because the bandits were rampant internally and the Qing people invaded externally. Internal and external pressures led to the downfall of the country. For several years, the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei have suffered from banditry. Although the authorities have repeatedly launched suppression campaigns, they have not been able to completely eliminate them. The biggest reason is that they have been constrained by internal wars. Now that Beijing and Guangdong are united and unification has reappeared, all the national military forces should use a part to consolidate the border defense and a part to suppress bandits, and eliminate them within a time limit without hesitation. The harm of bandits is like sores and ulcers. If they are not cut off, they will inevitably collapse. Moreover, if they are used by external evils, the disaster will be even worse. This is the third request. (4) Requesting the reorganization of finances, in recent years, due to tariff freedom, tax revenues have increased by tens of millions, and domestic debts have been issued for hundreds of millions. Financial income cannot be said to be small, but most of it is consumed in the flames of internal war. The ratio of military spending to annual income accounts for the largest amount in the world, while education expenses are in arrears to the point where singing and music are almost extinct, and diplomatic expenses are in arrears to the point where embassies are borrowing money. Internally, the foundation of the country is shaken, and externally, the national prestige is disgraced. Today, learning from the past, there should be a practical plan for reorganizing finances. Annual income and expenditure must be open. Take the wealth from the people and use it wisely. In particular, it should be recognized that the majority of annual income should be used for productive, constructive, and positive expenses. This is the fourth request. (5) Requesting an increase in production, if you want the country to prosper, you must first increase production. When production increases, the wealth will increase, and then the people's livelihood will not be strained. If you want to talk about increasing production, the following two points are prerequisites: (A) Seeking practical coordination between labor and capital, in recent years, the number of production factories has been decreasing. Even the original manufacturers are seeking to maintain their business but are declining, and seeking to close down is difficult. They cannot live and cannot die. The difficult situation is difficult to describe in words. In the future, the central government should determine the principles and stop labor-capital disputes. It must be known that in a backward China with underdeveloped production, there is only one way to unite and save the nation, and there is no possibility of labor-capital strife. Both sides will be hurt and perish together. Therefore, those who incite labor unrest and provoke class struggle must be absolutely prohibited so that those with assets will gradually shift their psychology of fearing to open factories, and then it will be possible to talk about increasing production. (B) Seeking the government's responsible assistance, national goods main factories are practically necessary and cannot be organized by the people's power immediately. The government should assist them and strive to correct the exaggeration of previous announcements and empty words, and make progress in practical and responsible facts, observing the results within a time limit and seeking truth from facts. Convenience should also be given in terms of tariffs and transportation so that they can reach the point of development and consolidation, and then the increase in production will have a significant effect. This is the fifth request. The above five points are the major ones, and the humble thoughts are that the plan for saving the nation may not be out of this. We respectfully present this petition, humbly requesting adoption and implementation. It will be the great fortune of the party and the country. Sincerely presented to the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>
<h3>Methods for Handling Sealed Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>To be Decided by the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent a letter yesterday to the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the methods for handling sealed Japanese goods, stating: "Respectfully, we are writing to inform you that the methods for handling sealed Japanese goods are currently being drafted by the Design Committee of this association for discussion and decision. Unexpectedly, your committee has already published and announced the proposed methods without seeking our consent, which is regrettable. The 19th Standing Committee Meeting of this association has resolved that, in addition to sending your proposed methods to the Design Committee for reference, your committee should promptly publish a correction in the newspaper, stating that these methods for handling sealed Japanese goods will not take effect unless approved by this association, in order to avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully addressed to the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Intensifying Anti-Japanese Work</h3>
<p>Resolutions of the 19th Standing Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association convened its 19th Standing Committee Meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Chu Huiseng, Wang Xiaoji, Lin Kanghou, Lu Jingshi, and Fang Jiaobo attended. Chu Huiseng was elected as chairman, and Zhao Shusheng and Tong Yikang recorded the minutes. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the Municipal Party Department's order, based on the Municipal Government's letter, concerning the return of the detained Swedish matches to their original owner and the instruction to report on the handling process, it was resolved that matches with Swedish consulate certification should be released, and the Municipal Party Department should be informed accordingly. (2) Regarding the letter from the Tiansun Clothing Company, concerning the previously detained serge, stating that they had inquired with the original owner, Lao Tonghe, about the origin of the goods at the time of purchase and were told they were Western goods. Now that it has been proven that they are Japanese goods, they have been deceived, and Lao Tonghe has hired a lawyer to threaten and detain their shop assistants when demanding payment. They request a fair judgment. It was resolved that the matter should be handed over to the Investigation Department for investigation and then assistance should be provided. (3) Regarding the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting agreement on the methods for handling all sealed Japanese goods in the city and seeking a public resolution, it was resolved that: (a) the matter should be handled promptly by the Design Committee and submitted to the Executive Committee; (b) a letter should be sent to the General Implementation Committee for Economic Severance with Japan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the methods were published without the association's consent, which is inappropriate, and a correction should be published. (4) Regarding the letter from the Paper Industry Association, informing of the inspection of Japanese goods at the Shengda Paper Store and the disciplinary actions taken, and requesting the transfer of the store's books to the association, it was resolved that the association's handling of the Shengda Paper Store was procedurally flawed, but out of patriotic enthusiasm, it should be approved. In the future, any such actions should be reported to the association first. Several dozen other important cases were also discussed, but details are omitted.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting Investigation of Tong Zijiun of the Da Chuan Tong Company</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Customs Declaration and Transportation Industry Association, stating: "Respectfully, according to confidential reports, Tong Zijiun, the manager of the Da Chuan Tong Customs Brokerage at 15 Jiujiang Road in this port, has long been a pro-Japanese running dog. His Da Chuan Tong Company is a disguised form of Qingyu. He primarily uses Japanese ships to report and load goods for various Hakka merchants, and therefore the Japanese shipping companies rely on him as their right-hand man, granting him the position of manager of the Chongqing Nissin Company, accumulating a vast fortune over the years. Now that the Japanese have invaded our Northeast, all Chinese people are heartbroken and filled with righteous indignation. Even three-foot-tall children are determined to overthrow the Japanese devils. Yet, this Tong Zijiun has become insane and not only fails to support the Anti-Japanese Association but also secretly supplies a large amount of coal to Japanese ships in Chongqing. This was discovered by the Chongqing Anti-Japanese Association, which immediately issued a warning. However, Tong ignored it and continued to supply coal from his Suichuan Coal Mine to the enemy's warships, allowing those ships to sail and deliberately sink many civilian ships along the way. The Anti-Japanese Association, having reached the limit of its tolerance, complied with the public's request and, on October 31st, seized Tong Zijiun, tied him up, made him sit inside Ming Bridge, stuck a paper label on his back, and made him wear a tall paper hat with the words 'Traitorous Merchant Tong So-and-so Paraded Through the Streets' written on it. Along the way, he was ordered to shout slogans such as 'I am a traitorous merchant!' After parading through the city, he was taken to the horse stables outside Tongyuan Gate and ordered to kneel on the ground. A shot was fired into the air, symbolically executing him. The people of the city were overwhelmingly pleased with the Anti-Japanese Association's actions. It is now reported that Tong Zijiun has fled to Shanghai to continue his traitorous activities. After verifying the above reports, the facts are confirmed. Tong Zijiun recognizes the enemy as his father and is determined to betray the country, which is outrageous. In addition to assigning our Investigation and Inspection Departments to pay close attention and monitor his actions, we hereby request your association to conduct a thorough investigation to eliminate this traitor and remove this menace to the community. We earnestly hope for your cooperation. Respectfully addressed to the Customs Declaration and Transportation Industry Association."</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Association Clarifies the Prohibition of Selling Korean Official Ginseng</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association replied to Mr. Zhang Baonian yesterday, clarifying that the Korean official ginseng exclusively sold by the Korean Governor-General's Office is absolutely prohibited from being sold: "Respectfully, we have received your letter stating that the Korean ginseng produced in Korea is a result of the Japanese's long-term policy of oppressing the Korean people and is handled exclusively by Mitsui &amp; Co., and should be completely prohibited from being purchased. Your concern for the national salvation movement is admirable. However, the Korean ginseng approved for sale by the 15th Standing Committee Meeting of our association was based on the request of the Shanghai Korean Commercial Conference, which stated that the two types of natural and artificial products within Korea were indeed operated by Koreans. These include Korean apples produced by the Chosun Pyeongannamdo Jinnampo Biseok Fruit Industry Co., Ltd., and the Gwagwae Fruit Industry Co., Ltd. and Korean white ginseng produced by the Korean Gyeonggido Kaeo Ginseng Fruit Cooperative, and Korean dried salamanders produced by farmers in mountainous areas of Pyeonganbukdo and Gangwondo. The total value of these products sold in China annually is no more than 50,000 yuan. To support the Korean people, we have specifically permitted the sale of these items. However, the Korean official ginseng exclusively sold by the Korean Governor-General's Office and sold by Mitsui &amp; Co. in this city remains strictly prohibited from being sold, and there is absolutely no possibility of compromise. The Shanghai Korean Commercial Conference is indeed organized by Koreans residing in Shanghai. Our association has obtained written proof from the Korean Provisional Government and the responsible persons of the Korean Residents' Association. This is to reassure you. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Zhang Baonian."</p>
<h3>Two Proposals to the National Goods Grand Alliance</h3>
<p>The Committee for the Promotion of National Goods Grand Alliance received two proposals from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday. These proposals, concerning the raw materials of national goods and the future of their promotion, are of great importance. The secretariat has included them in the minutes of the 5th Standing Committee Meeting. The proposals are recorded below: (1) Original proposal for inspecting advertisements of national goods stores and factories: According to Mr. He Shuoman's letter, the market is flooded with Japanese goods, making shopping extremely difficult. Women and children are especially susceptible to being deceived. It would be best if your association could investigate the names of national goods in detail, classify them, and create a booklet to be distributed to each household for easy reference. Also, many stores and factories advertise themselves as selling completely national goods, but whether they are actually national goods is unknown to the people. In the future, could your association adopt a method similar to that of the film censorship board and add a statement of product inspection from your organization under each advertisement so that readers can understand and not be misled? This matter was proposed by the Design Committee of our association and resolved at the 17th Standing Committee Meeting to be handled by the National Goods Grand Alliance and recorded in the minutes. We hereby send this letter so that you can investigate and handle it accordingly. (2) Original proposal for establishing national goods daily necessities factories: Approved Item 2 of the proposal from Mr. Jin Runxiang of the Accounting Committee of our association, which is to establish a Production Design Committee, hire experts in various industries and specialized talents, first study the daily necessities of the people that are not yet produced, research their raw materials, machine purchasing methods, calculate product costs, and provide designs to society to advise capitalists or industry groups to quickly establish public factories to meet the needs, thereby accommodating workers and thoroughly implementing economic severance and the non-cooperation movement. This matter was proposed by our association and resolved at the 17th Standing Committee Meeting to be handled by the National Goods Grand Alliance and recorded in the minutes. We hereby send this letter so that you can investigate and handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Hosted a Banquet Last Night</h3>
<p>Central representative Mr. Chen Mingshu hosted a banquet at his private residence on Gaoen Road last night, inviting Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaoshu, Zou Haibin, Zhang Puquan, Zhang Qun, and Hu Zhantang. Mr. Wu Zhihui was also among those invited. They shook hands and chatted happily during the banquet, and also discussed the remarks made by a certain Central Committee member a few days ago. They laughed and resolved everything over drinks, and jointly planned for sincere unity. The guests and hosts chatted until after 9:00 PM before dispersing.</p>

<h3>Zhu Ziqiao Requests Raising Massive Funds to Implement Urgent Assistance to Labor and Agriculture</h3>
<p>Technical Committee to Meet Tomorrow to Distribute Large Quantities of Cotton Clothing to Disaster Areas</p>
<p>The director of the Disaster Area Working Group of the National Government Flood Disaster Relief Committee yesterday submitted a proposal to the committee requesting the preparation of cash funds to urgently assist the implementation of aid to workers and farmers, stating, "The urgent assistance is currently underway, and assistance to both workers and farmers should continue to advance urgently to avoid missing the opportune moment. Currently, the import period for American wheat has largely begun to show signs, so there is no concern about food for urgent assistance to workers and farmers. However, the implementation of each assistance program, such as the office expenses for urgent assistance, transportation expenses, travel expenses for staff, shipping costs for assistance items, materials for worker assistance, work tools, foreman supervision, travel allowances for surveyors, and all expenses for various worker assistance offices, as well as plowing oxen, farm implements, repairing houses, and various costs for agricultural assistance, cannot be adequately addressed solely with American wheat and must be supplemented with cash funds in order to proceed. If cash funds are not prepared early, the American wheat may arrive, but its use will not be effective, not only delaying work and agriculture but also causing the American wheat to accumulate and be difficult to store. If there is spoilage or decay, the losses will be even more frightening. It is proposed that the two items of relief work funds of 10 million yuan and reserve funds of 5 million yuan, as estimated by Chairman Song at the first general meeting of this committee in mid-June, be fully raised to cope with the various payments for urgent assistance to workers and farmers," and so on.</p>
<h3>Urgent Relief Plan for Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>Zhu also reported detailed plans to the committee yesterday regarding the progress of agricultural and industrial relief work, stating, "This group was hastily established and shouldered the burden of this unprecedented disaster area and unprecedented relief effort. At one point, there was an unavoidable scramble to gather talent and divide the area for work, which is not to be denied. Those who are not familiar with the situation in the disaster area may think that the relief is slow and have some blame. In fact, official assistance has regulations and cannot be compared to private donations, which can be given to anyone, anywhere. Those affected this time are people displaced by the flood. Investigating disaster-stricken households is impossible without boats. The first step of submitting a household register is not easy. Verifying households based on the register takes even more time. Fortunately, at the time of the disaster, various charitable organizations and local governments had already taken measures to provide urgent assistance nearby. The central government's assistance is taking over afterwards, which is also appropriate. It is consistent with what Chairman Song said at the first general meeting, 'The most difficult time for disaster victims is not during the extremely enthusiastic period of the disaster, but on the day when the sound of the disaster gradually subsides, and the functions of this committee are most important after the passage of time.' The purpose is that although the distribution is late, the relief items are still there, and the disaster is not something that can be eliminated in a short time. However, the methods of each assistance program must have certain standards, otherwise errors will inevitably arise. Now, I will submit a report on the separate regulations and standard guidelines for urgent agricultural and industrial assistance for your consideration: (A) Under the Urgent Assistance item: (1) Division of labor responsibilities; (2) Scope of industrial assistance; (3) Guidelines for district commissioners to proceed from November; (4) Standards for winter urgent assistance; (5) Detailed rules for the winter and spring urgent assistance of using work as a form of relief; (B) Under the Industrial Assistance item: (6) Draft articles of association for the Technical Committee; (7) Draft proposal for determining the scope of construction; (8) Organizational system and detailed rules for the Industrial Assistance Office; (9) Regulations for the foreman training class; (C) Under the Agricultural Assistance item: (10) Draft outline of the agricultural assistance program; (11) Draft agricultural assistance program; (12) Draft organizational rules for the Agricultural Assistance Office; (13) Detailed rules for the implementation of assistance by the Agricultural Assistance Office; (14) Detailed rules for the Agricultural Assistance Bureau; (15) Detailed rules for the rural mutual aid society."</p>
<h3>Technical Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The National Government Flood Disaster Relief Committee will hold a Technical Committee meeting on November 16th at the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss the implementation of industrial assistance methods. A preparatory meeting will be held at the club on the evening of the 15th. The official meeting will be held on the morning of the 16th at 9:00 AM. Those attending the preliminary meeting will include Xi Dejiong, director of the Industrial Assistance Office of the committee; Li Xie, chief engineer; and technical expert committee members Charles, Stokes, Baker, Zhou Xiangxian, and others, as well as the heads of the construction departments of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces and representatives of water conservancy organizations, a total of more than 20 people. All are Chinese and foreign engineering experts with considerable experience in water conservancy projects in our country. It is expected that they will gather together to discuss industrial assistance plans and create immeasurable benefits for the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing Distributed to Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The National Government Flood Relief Committee has received a total of more than 5.6 million yuan in donations from all parties as of yesterday. As winter is approaching and disaster victims lack the means to keep warm, the committee is rushing to produce 400,000 sets of cotton-padded jackets and trousers. It is now transporting them to disaster areas far away. A total of 50,000 sets of new cotton clothing and 50,000 sets of old cotton clothing have been transported to Hunan, 18,000 sets of new cotton clothing have been transported to Changsha, and 20,000 sets have been transported to Hankou. The provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu will be rushed to transport them within two days so that the disaster victims can keep warm.</p>
<h3>Fire on North Shaanxi Road Kills Four</h3>
<p>One Injured, Condition Uncertain, Fire in Car Causes Major Disaster</p>
<p>At around 11:45 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at Nos. 882 to 887, along the street of Shaoyu Lane on North Shaanxi Road in the Public Concession, destroying six houses, burning to death four women, and injuring one person. The fire started in the Wang Yefeng car shop at No. 886. Upstairs lived Wang Shuihua, the local owner of the Xieda Carriage Company, and his wife and daughter-in-law, Zhang. Also Wang’s maternal aunt, Zhang Wang, Wang’s daughter Chen Wang, and Wang’s niece Wang Mei, all lived upstairs. The fire was intense, and smoke was everywhere. In a short time, it spread to the left and right. Although the fire brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire, there was nothing they could do for a while. Except for Wang Shuihua and his wife, Zhang Wang, Chen Wang, Wang Zhang, and Wang Mei all died in the fire. Wang’s wife, Zhang, managed to escape, but she was also severely burned. It is said that the fire was caused by a car catching fire in the car shop. Once it started, it could not be controlled. The women upstairs panicked when they heard the fire, and the stairs were broken, so they could only wait to die, without any hope of escaping. The destroyed houses were Nos. 887 to 882, a total of six houses. The east wing column of No. 888 Shaoxing Lane was also affected, but there was no major problem. The names and ages of the deceased are as follows: Zhang Wang, Wang Shuihua’s maternal aunt, 60 years old; Chen Wang, Wang’s daughter, 33 years old; Wang Zhang, daughter-in-law, 23 years old; Wang Mei, Wang’s niece, 4 years old. Wang’s wife, Zhang, 53 years old, was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, and her condition is uncertain. It is also heard that Wang Zhang and others went to visit Wang, who was sick, and her daughter had returned home after marrying, also returned home to enjoy family life. Who knew they would encounter such a strange change, which is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>The Inheritance Dispute of Hardoon</h3>
<p>Five Cousins Oppose the Execution of the Will</p>
<p>The Iraqi Government Informs the British Consulate in This Port by Telegram</p>
<p>Hardoon Did Not Register to Renounce Iraqi Nationality</p>
<p>Hardoon’s Cousin Also Starts to Dispute the Inheritance</p>
<p>The Mainland Daily reports that after the death of Jewish tycoon Hardoon, Ezra Hardoon and others, claiming to be his cousins, started to dispute the inheritance and submitted a request to the British Court to oppose the execution of Hardoon’s will. According to their representative lawyer, the British Court yesterday granted the plaintiff an extension of four weeks to submit a detailed complaint for review. It is also said that the late Hardoon never registered to obtain British nationality, which is more beneficial to the plaintiff, because it is believed that Iraqi law will be applied, and Iraqi inheritance regulations are more lenient to Hardoon’s relatives. Hardoon’s wife’s position under Iraqi regulations is also different from English law. Furthermore, the Iraqi government has informed the British Consulate in this port by telegram that the late Hardoon never registered to renounce Iraqi nationality. Please convey this to the Procuratorate to suspend the execution of the will. It is reported that Ezra and five other cousins in Iraq had submitted a request to the local court in Baghdad to oppose the execution of Hardoon’s will. Recently, another person claiming to be Hardoon’s cousin has also started to dispute the inheritance. However, according to Ezra’s lawyer, this person’s mother only had a blood relationship with the Hardoon family, and since his mother passed away, he has lost the right to inherit the inheritance.</p>
<h3>Wu Yifeng, Captain of the Wusong Water Police, Dies in Action While Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>There is currently a gang of about 200 pirates outside Wusongkou. It is said that they are the old troops of Ma Yuren. After Jiang Chaoxiong, the district chief of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police, led a team to severely suppress them, the sea surface became slightly calmer. However, this gang of bandits recently sneaked to the Longwangkou port area to harass. District Chief Jiang sent Wu Yifeng, the captain of the Huaihai Special Task Force, to encircle and suppress them. On the 12th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits for a day and a night, sinking a bandit ship and killing dozens of bandits. On the morning of the 13th, during intense gunfire on both sides, Captain Wu was suddenly hit by a bandit bullet, which pierced through his abdomen. Unable to support himself, he fell into the cabin, but still ordered his troops to fight hard. After another half an hour of stalemate, the bandits scattered and fled. However, Captain Wu died of excessive blood loss due to his injuries. His subordinates telegraphed the Wusong Water Police District Headquarters. Yesterday, District Chief Jiang reported to the provincial government for a posthumous award. The vacancy left by Captain Wu has been temporarily filled by Cai Sheping, the squad leader of the team, by telegram order.</p>

According to the office staff, they were ordered by the municipal government and are temporary in nature. To save disaster relief funds, they are all transferred from the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The section affairs are inevitably piled up due to this. They are now rushing to finish the office affairs to return to the bureau to serve on another day.</p>

<h3>Pudong Electric Company Reduces Burden on Users</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting Next January</p>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company has been operating diligently, sparing no effort. Unfortunately, due to the separation by the Huangpu River and inconvenient transportation, the market is not yet prosperous. The company's business is also limited by the environment and has not been fully developed. In recent years, affected by high gold prices, all expenses have continued to rise. Recently, it has added stock funds to actively expand its lines, which has increased its burden. However, it is heard that the company believes that the operation of the electric business is closely related to the people's enjoyment. Even in the midst of hardship and difficulty, it is still planning ways to give preferential treatment to users. It plans to reduce the electricity bill to 21 cents per degree starting next January (year 21) and continue to reduce it by one cent starting the following year (year 22), that is, actually charging 20 cents per degree. It is also heard that the company, in order to encourage small users to install lights, in addition to implementing a loan installation program, plans to reduce the electricity meter deposit starting next January. Those installing three to five lights will only be charged five yuan to reduce the burden on users. The motor electricity bill is also planned to be reduced appropriately. The electricity usage for each horsepower per month within 150 degrees will be reduced to 8 cents per unit; The electricity usage for each horsepower per month over 150 degrees will be reduced to 7 cents per unit; The electricity usage for each horsepower per month over 250 degrees will be reduced to 6 cents per unit; The electricity usage for each horsepower per month over 350 degrees will be reduced to 5 cents per unit. All will be implemented starting next January. The original operating regulations will be revised accordingly and submitted to the government for record.</p>
<h3>Li Henian, Shareholder of Sino-American Banking Corporation, Arrested</h3>
<p>Many Opium Pills Found in His Pants</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Sino-American Banking Corporation at No. 13 Guangdong Road, Wu Shiying (also known as Ming), a local female employee of the bank, hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to sue the owners of the company, Ma Zhichao, Li Yaoguang, Cheng Chunlin, and Li Henian, for fraudulently obtaining property, deceiving security deposits, etc., in the Special No. 1 Court. The court once summoned the defendants, but all of them failed to appear. Therefore, it was ordered that they be detained and interrogated again. Yesterday morning, Wu led Lu Xiqi, a translator from the French Concession Police Station, and a Western police officer to arrest Li Henian at No. 381 Xin Dagulu. In the afternoon, he was escorted to the Sixth Criminal Division and interrogated by Judge Jiang Gongliang. Wu proved that the security deposit of 540 yuan and 400 shares of Jiangnan Paper Factory stock were all received by Li, but Li denied it, saying that he was also an employee and in the same position as the plaintiff. Judge Jiang then ordered a postponement for another hearing. It is heard that when Li was arrested, translator Lu found many opium pills in his leg pants, so the police station will also file a public prosecution.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shihua Counter-Sues Yao Cuidi</h3>
<p>The Dispute Over the Pawning of a Wife Continues</p>
<p>Zhang Shihua, a Ningbo native who runs a lacquer workshop at 815 Yongcheng Lane, Broadway Road, because he is approaching fifty and still has no children, pawned Yao Cuidi as his wife according to Ningbo customs. Before several months had passed, Yao wrapped up her clothes and other belongings and took them away, and sued Zhang in the First Special District Court for crimes such as deception and abuse. This case has been heard once and has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was another date for the retrial. Zhang, because Yao had already taken her clothes and filed an unreasonable claim of 10,000 yuan with the court, hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to file a countersuit. The reasons for his countersuit were that after Yao divorced her former husband, her father was unable to support her, and matchmakers came several times to speak on her behalf. Therefore, according to Ningbo customs, he pawned her for ten years for 200 yuan. After she entered the house, he treated her extremely well. However, Cuidi's wild nature was difficult to tame, and Zhang's temperament was mediocre and weak, and he was extremely tolerant. Unexpectedly, on September 26, she wrapped up her clothes and other items and fled. He reported it to the police station. Cuidi, knowing that the situation was unfavorable, fabricated facts and hired a lawyer to sue him. Her behavior was intended to release pigeons (a Chinese idiom that roughly translates to 'deceive someone'). Moreover, there is a pawning contract and witness Ding Zi's testimony to prove it. As for the matter of storing 1,000 yuan on her behalf, it was found that the plaintiff was in dire straits when she was pawned. If she had savings, why would she do this? If it is said that she earned it from needlework, then only four months passed between her divorce from her husband and her pawning to Zhang. How could she have accumulated such a large savings so quickly? He also presented expenses of about 1,600 yuan that were taken away and lost, requesting a judgment ordering her to repay them, etc. When Yao Cuidi was interrogated, she stated that if Zhang lived with her in the name of filling a vacancy in his household, then she would be willing. But if the pawning contract was cancelled and she was recognized as a concubine, then she would not be willing. Only if 10,000 yuan was deposited in the bank would she be willing to live with him. The defendant's representative stated that he could not agree to the cohabitation, because she had cunning intentions. At this point, the judge ordered the defendant himself to be brought to court, and the hearing was rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Song Xueqin is Sued for Having a Daughter</h3>
<p>His Concubine Acts as Legal Guardian to Request Food, Clothing, and Education Expenses</p>
<p>When Sun Chuanfang served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Allied Forces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi, there was a man named Song Xueqin who was a confidant of Sun. Sun appointed Song as the director of the Shanghai Office. Many people in Shanghai know his name. Later, Sun lost power, and Song also resigned. However, having been an official for a time, his pockets were already full. After divorcing his concubine, Bo Xuezhen, for 20,000 yuan this summer, Bo gave birth to a daughter named Song Lizhen, who is now seven years old. Yesterday, Bo Xuezhen, in her capacity as legal guardian, represented her daughter as the plaintiff and hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Dong Yu, etc., to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, requesting the allocation of alimony and education funds. The gist of the lawsuit was that the plaintiff is the defendant's biological daughter, which is not disputed by the defendant, and the father has an obligation to support and educate his minor children, which is also stipulated by the Civil Code. The defendant followed General Sun Xinyuan to serve as an official in Jiangnan in 1925. Although it only lasted a few years, he accumulated no less than one million yuan. Considering the family situation, the plaintiff has the possibility of receiving excellent support and higher education. Unfortunately, this summer, the plaintiff's mother, Bo, was abandoned by the defendant for no reason. The plaintiff had no choice but to leave with her mother. Although the defendant once paid her mother, Bo, 20,000 yuan, designating it as expenses for leaving the family relationship and supporting the plaintiff, the plaintiff is the defendant's biological daughter, and all rights to inheritance, education, and support cannot be stripped away simply because her mother has left the family. Therefore, they requested a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff 100,000 yuan in standard silver dollars as a fund for the plaintiff's food, clothing, support, education, etc., until she reaches adulthood in more than ten years. Yesterday was the date of the hearing. The lawyers for both parties appeared in court and requested that the case be temporarily rescheduled for hearing so that they could reconcile outside of court. The court granted their request, so the hearing was rescheduled again.</p>
<h3>Leprosy Society Welcomes Feng Shaoshan</h3>
<p>The board of directors of the China Leprosy Relief Association yesterday held a meeting at the Shanghai Bank conference room to welcome former director Mr. Feng Shaoshan, newly hired medical consultant Dr. Luo Aisi, and Dr. Kuang Fuzhuo, the association's vice president who recently returned to Shanghai from the United States. First, Chairman Li Yuanxin gave a welcome speech. Kuang Fuzhuo and Luo Si then gave speeches, both stating the importance of leprosy relief and their interest in their positions, which was quite moving. Then, Secretary-General Wu Zhijian reported on the association's affairs, briefly stating that "the association recently allocated 5,000 yuan to build the Qiongya Leprosy Hospital in Hainan Island. The Shanghai Women's Support Association purchased 67 beds and blankets and donated them to the hospital. The new Nanchang Leprosy Hospital in Jiangxi has a very developed clinic. It is planning to raise 5,000 yuan to add a hall and workshop, etc., for use." Next, the National Leprosy Conference was discussed and decided to be held on April 14th and 15th of next year. To expedite the handling, Mai Yagu, Li Yuanxin, Wu Liande, Luo Aisi, Yan Fuqing, Fei Wusheng, Kuang Fuzhuo, etc., were designated as preparatory committee members to be responsible for carrying it out. It was originally planned to raise 50,000 yuan starting this month to build a new leprosy clinic in Shanghai. Due to the impact of the current situation, it was decided to postpone the fundraising to next year.</p>

<h3>Today's Finance Committee Meeting in Beijing</h3>
<p>Bank Representatives Talk About Reasons for Guangdong Representatives Not Attending</p>
<p>The National Government Finance Committee, which was produced based on the principles of the Ningbo-Guangdong Peace Preparatory Meeting, is scheduled to meet in Beijing today. Bank representatives Zhang Gongquan, Wu Daquan, and Li Fuxun from this port took the express train to Beijing at 3:15 pm yesterday. Deputy Finance Minister Zhang Shouyong's toothache has healed, and he also went to Beijing last night to attend the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee. Reporters from various news agencies, believing that the establishment of this Finance Committee is very important, specially visited bank representatives Zhang Gongquan, Wu Daquan, and Li Fuxun yesterday to inquire. According to the three, financial circles have never intended to participate in politics, nor do they have the time to participate. This Finance Committee has appointed us as members, and the responsibilities of the committee are very important. We are afraid that we will not be able to fulfill them. However, because the establishment of the Finance Committee is based on the resolution of the peace conference representatives on the 6th of this month, the resolution to establish the Finance Committee stated that "in order to prevent civil war, the central and local financial revenues, such as those provided for military expenditures, should be limited to national defense and bandit suppression. The Finance Committee may reject all burdens related to civil war." Considering that the establishment of the committee is entirely based on the spirit of peaceful unification, the Bankers Association issued a declaration on November 5th and elected members to appeal to both parties for peace. This Finance Committee, established based on the peaceful resolution, is something we can not refuse to join, in order to carry out the purpose of calling for peace in the financial community. We hope that finances can be made public, budgets can be determined, and the credit of national debts can be maintained, so as to move towards the path of peace and construction.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee was approved to hold an inaugural meeting in Nanjing today. Cai Yuanpei, the Beijing representative of the Peace Conference, sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaochu, and Zou Lu, the Guangdong representatives remaining in Shanghai, asking them to recommend several people to go to Beijing to participate. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited Wu Chaochu at Guandu Residence on Gordon Road to inquire about his views. According to Wu, he did not yet know whether representatives would be sent to participate and that it would be decided after a meeting this afternoon (yesterday). However, he believes that the Nanjing Finance Committee has discrepancies with the proposals previously put forward by them and passed by the Peace Preparatory Meeting. The differences are in three points: (1) the organization is different; (2) the powers are different; (3) the spirit is different. These three points are what make the Nanjing Finance Committee different from the Finance Committee passed by the Peace Preparatory Meeting. Therefore, he cannot say whether representatives will be sent to participate before meeting and consulting. They planned to meet and discuss tonight. By 5:30 pm, the three representatives had met and consulted. According to Wang and Wu, it had been decided not to send anyone to participate. After unification is achieved, a Finance Committee will be established according to what was passed by the Peace Preparatory Meeting to reorganize the national finances. It was also heard that Wang and others had telegraphed Cai Yuanpei that evening to explain the reasons for deciding not to send anyone to participate.</p>
<h3>British Nationals Oppose Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Meeting Held the Other Day and Decided to Telegraph British Authorities</p>
<p>British nationals in this port, seeing that China has been striving to abolish the rights granted by unequal treaties in recent years, are trying to make a final struggle. Since the Manchurian Incident occurred, they believe there is an opportunity to take advantage of it. They specially organized a British nationals association. On Tuesday evening, they held an inaugural meeting at the Race Club. They passed a resolution on the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction. The other day, they telegraphed the British Foreign Office and major British newspapers. The contents roughly stated that the Shanghai British nationals conference, in view of the current unstable situation and political unrest in China, and the lack of a government with stable and solid power, unanimously believes that negotiations on the abolition of consular jurisdiction should not be accelerated, and also believes that this issue and the related issue of the future of the four concessions of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Shameen should be observed from the perspective that the Nanjing government cannot or is unwilling to effectively control the provincial authorities and military authorities in fulfilling treaty obligations.</p>
<h3>Jilin Representative Sends Telegram to the Northeast Reception Committee</h3>
<p>Hu Tiguan and other representatives of the people of Jilin sent a telegram to the committee in charge of taking over various areas in the Northeast region: "Esteemed sirs, since the loss of the Northeast, the whole country has been plunged into darkness and misery. Only the League of Nations' resolution on the limited-term withdrawal of troops and the establishment of our country's committee to reclaim lost territory have brought a glimmer of hope to this bleak scene. However, even if the League of Nations has made such a resolution, and even if Japan complies with the resolution to withdraw troops, the future of the Northeast is still not necessarily optimistic. The main key still lies in the efforts of you sirs. If the reception is nominally a reception, but is accompanied by various other conditions, then the reception will become a transformation of concessions. Japan receives substantial benefits, and we gain empty names. This kind of reception is not a reception, but a betrayal. It will only allow Japanese aggression to gain legitimate protection. The future of the Northeast will be forever lost as a result, and the world will be in trouble from now on. This kind of behavior is not only a betrayal of China, but also an unforgivable scourge to the whole world and all mankind. You sirs are serving the country with distinction and have a well-established reputation. Bearing this responsibility, you will certainly not make any mistakes. However, the matter is heavy, the Japanese are cunning, and the gains and losses are close. We sincerely hope that you will act with your own conscience and take the interests of the country as the premise, without being tempted by profit, without being intimidated by threats, and without compromising for private gain. Seriously accept the handover, and do not stipulate any conditions or similar conditions. The future of the Northeast and the safety of China depend on this. As for the people of the Northeast, they all hold a determination to sacrifice themselves as a backing for negotiations. We would rather perish together than live in humiliation. Without doubt or hesitation, the will of the people becomes a fortress. We hope that you will take note of this. Respectfully, Hu Tiguan and Jiang Songnian, representatives of the people of Jilin."</p>
<h3>Overseas Representatives to the Fourth National Congress Pass Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Overseas representatives to the Fourth National Congress, Feng Rugen from India and Wang Quansheng from the Philippines, arrived in Shanghai the other day aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Grant. Zhou Xisan, a staff member of the Central Government in Shanghai, met them at the ship, and they transferred to a night train to Beijing. Another seven representatives from Australia, the Dutch East Indies, and other places are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today aboard the French mail ship Lusong and transfer to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Burden of Seafarer Registration by the Bureau of Navigation</h3>
<p>Shanghai Seafarers Oppose Again and Directly Petition the Ministry to Abolish It</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai Bureau of Navigation to handle the registration of seafarers in the navigation and marine engineering departments. The registration fees have as many as nine items, which is an unprecedented extortion from seafarers. It was agreed to oppose it unanimously and has sent a letter to the bureau requesting the ministry to abolish it. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Now it is heard that neither side is giving in, and the registration is also being obstructed. A follow-up report will be published below.</p>
<p>Seafarers' Attitude Firm Since the navigators' association and other organizations agreed on the 11th of this month that the current seafarer registration is a harsh tax and unreasonable and that they cannot be subjected to fee payments every time they are hired or fired, they issued a notice ordering the crew members of various merchant ships not to register until the matter is resolved. Since the notice was issued, the personnel of the navigation and marine engineering departments of various ships have uniformly followed the association's resolution and refused to register, and their attitude has been consistent and very firm. They are determined to follow the overall policy and abide by the public consensus in the association, and will not register individually.</p>
<p>Few People Register After the new regulations were issued in Shanghai, but before the navigators' association issued a notice to stop registration, a total of ten or more people from the marine engineering and seafarer departments went to the Bureau of Navigation to pay the fees, register, and receive manuals. However, after the opposition was raised, no one went to the bureau to register again. It is heard that foreign crew members serving on Chinese ships are also being treated the same way. One or two Westerners had already gone to pay the fees and register, but they have now also stopped.</p>
<p>Bureau of Navigation Issues Instructions The Bureau of Navigation received the navigators' association's official letter requesting it to forward it to the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the registration measures. Yesterday, it was heard that Director Xi believed that the matter was imperative and replied to the association, stating that seafarer registration has precedents in various countries and is not a Chinese innovation. The request to forward it to the ministry for cancellation is difficult to approve. At the same time, it plans to notify the seafarers to go to the bureau to register quickly and not to wait and see.</p>
<p>Seafarers Petition the Ministry Since the Shanghai Bureau of Navigation did not forward it to the Ministry of Communications, the crew members of the navigation and marine engineering departments requested the association again to directly petition the Ministry of Communications based on the reasons for opposition previously submitted, asking them to consider that the shipping industry is still in its infancy and there is a lack of specialized talent, to uphold the principle of encouraging and protecting it, and to immediately abolish this harsh registration so as not to allow the seafarers who are just budding to be destroyed by this exploitation. The petition has been drafted and will be sent out immediately.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Raw Materials for Mercerized Dyeing Industry</h3>
<p>In Order to Provide Remedies, Industry to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss</p>
<p>Since various industries automatically refused to import Japanese goods, the raw materials for the mercerized dyeing industry in this city have caused great panic. The trade association once telegraphed the government to approve measures for dismissing employees. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believed that cotton yarn raw materials could be replaced by British goods and prohibited the closure of factories or the dismissal of employees. However, the trade association believed that it would be difficult to order British goods in practice and continued to ask the Bureau of Social Affairs to provide remedies. The bureau then scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to discuss the measures. The various situations are reported below.</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs to Discuss Measures Tomorrow After receiving the trade association's continued report on the difficult situation, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believed that the statements were indeed true. After detailed consideration, they believed that the matter was important and decided to convene a meeting at the bureau at 10:00 am tomorrow, inviting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association and other agencies and organizations to discuss remedies. The letter was sent to the relevant agencies and organizations yesterday, stating: "According to the Municipal Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association's telegraph, there is a shortage of raw materials and most factories have stopped working. Please set measures for dismissing employees to reduce disputes, etc. In the process of handling, we received the Municipal Government's Order No. 10214, approving the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's telegraph, stating that there is already a solution for cotton yarn raw materials. Please prohibit the closure of factories or the dismissal of employees and instruct compliance. We have instructed compliance with the approval. Now, according to the association's continued report, various factories in the industry lack both experience and resources for ordering British cotton yarn. We should ask the government to set up British yarn sales agencies and provide various conveniences to buyers, which may be helpful. Otherwise, we can only suspend business and dismiss employees, etc. After investigation, the statements made by the association are indeed true. Because the matter is important, the solution should not be delayed. We have decided to convene a meeting at this bureau at 10:00 am on the 16th of this month, inviting various relevant agencies and organizations to discuss remedies. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby inform you and hope that you will check and send representatives to attend at the appointed time."</p>
<p>Trade Association to Hold General Meeting Today After receiving the letter from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Trade Association has specially scheduled a general meeting of all mercerized dyeing industry members at 10:00 am today at the association's location in Ruilin Lane, Aiduya Road, to discuss: (1) the raw material problem, (2) the appointment of representatives to attend the meeting, and (3) the issue of workers' wages after the factories are closed. An urgent notice has already been issued.</p>

We are also honored to have representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attend and provide guidance.</p>
<p>Report on Preparations In May of this year, the Shanghai Shipping Association was ordered by the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs to issue organizational rules for the Shipping Association, reorganize into the Shanghai Shipping Association, revise the articles of association, and submit them to the ministry and bureau for record. Subsequently, we received instructions from the ministry and bureau that the organizational rules of the Shipping Association had been revoked by order of the Executive Yuan, and we were instructed to follow the Industry and Commerce Trade Association Law. The original initiators of the Shipping Association, China Merchants, Sanbei, Zhengji, Zhaoxing, Ningshao, Northern, Pingan, and Hongan, eight companies, initiated the organization of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Trade Association, and reported to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters for approval, and issued a permit with the license number 1. Yu Qiaqing, Guo Waifeng, and Yuan Ludeng were appointed as members from the initiators, and preparations began on September 8. A preparatory committee was set up at 10 Guangdong Road, and the filing was made with the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs in accordance with the regulations. The articles of association were drafted and members were solicited, and it took five weeks to complete. A total of 66 shipping companies and firms have joined the association, with 82 member representatives. The draft articles of association and member roster have been submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval and filing. All preparatory procedures have come to an end. A general meeting of members is specially convened today to formally establish the association. The preparatory process is reported as follows.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches The representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, He Yuanming, said, "I have two thoughts on the establishment of the Shipping Industry Trade Association to share with everyone. The shipping industry of a country is like the blood of a person. When the blood is flowing smoothly, the person must be strong. When the shipping industry is developed, the country will be strong. Looking at the Spanish and Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries, their shipping industry can be said to be the strongest at sea. British Finnis once said that the prosperity of a country depends on the development of the shipping industry. Not only that, but also the agricultural and industrial industries have a related relationship. From this, it can be seen that the shipping industry has a great impact on the country. Moreover, water occupies three-quarters of the earth, and land occupies one quarter. The world's trade depends on sea transport for seven or eight tenths of its power. After China opened its sea ban, the shipping industry made no progress. There are two reasons for this: (a) it is bound by unequal treaties, and foreigners have seized the right to navigate the inland rivers; and (b) there is no shipping finance agency. The right of navigation is the inherent right of a country's shipping industry. Now, the shipping interests of inland ports, rivers, and coasts have been destroyed, which is very painful to say. I hope that all shipping merchants will work hard to plan and gradually recover them. The lack of shipping finance agencies is also a pain for shipping merchants. In various European and American countries, financial agencies have done their best to invest and promote the shipping industry. Looking back at the financial circles in our country, most of the financial resources are invested in real estate and other industries, which is a pity. I sincerely hope that shipping people will work hard to develop their own industry." Next, the representative of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Hu Yuqi, said, (1) all groups should recognize the meaning of the group and must maintain its health; (2) special attention should be paid to the selection of personnel; (3) all members must not give up their responsibilities. Next, Chairman Yuan answered and began the election.</p>
<p>Elected Committee Members The list of elected executive committee members is as follows: Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Zeng Guangqing, Li Yuancheng, Li Zichu, Chen Ganqing, Wang Bofen, Zheng Xitang, Lu Bohong, Xu Zhongxin, Liu Shisun, and others. Alternates: Sun Meitang, Hu Yongqi, Yu Shunmao, Ding Xijun, Jiang Gutang, Chen Shuntong, etc. It is scheduled to take office and swear an oath next week.</p>
<h3>Proposal from Sugar Merchants to Restore the National Sugar Factory</h3>
<p>Drafting a Plan for Submission to the Ministry of Industry for Consideration</p>
<p>After Japan forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin, the Chinese people spontaneously boycotted Japanese goods. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Association believes that the sugar needed by our country is of various types, with machine-made refined sugar being the most demanded. In the past, we relied on Japan for this supply. Now, as we vigorously carry out the anti-Japanese movement, it is even more imperative to expedite sugar refining to thoroughly implement the economic boycott. Our country's former merchant-run National Sugar Factory (located in Wusong Yuncao Creek) was founded by the late Ma Yushan. Due to financial constraints and lack of experience, it was soon shut down. However, its equipment is still quite complete. In June of this year, when sugar merchants went to Beijing to petition for a joint venture sugar factory, Vice Minister Zhao suggested that they propose a plan for restoring the National Sugar Factory. The Sugar Merchants Association has now drafted a detailed plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for consideration. The contents are as follows: (1) Use public bonds as a fund; (2) Issue public bonds of five million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of eight percent, principal and interest to be repaid in five years, guaranteed by a surcharge of one dime of silver on each picul of imported sugar collected by the Customs; (3) Allocation of the public bonds: A. Approximately one million yuan to repay the previous factory's debts; B. Approximately fifty thousand yuan to add some machinery and make repairs; C. Approximately three million yuan for raw material preparation; D. Approximately five hundred thousand yuan for working capital; (4) Management and sovereignty of the factory: When collecting the surcharge on sugar, sugar merchants should issue receipts, which can be used to exchange for factory shares after five years. Before the principal and interest of the public bonds are repaid, the factory will be managed by the Ministry of Industry, with a management committee. After the public bonds are repaid, the factory will be managed by merchants; (5) Strict management of factory affairs should be implemented; (6) Subsidies and incentives; (7) Regarding sustainability, the necessary capital needs to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Pays Attention to Agriculture</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Agricultural Education Museum, in order to encourage cotton planting and the raising of draught cattle, recently held an agricultural exhibition and draught cattle competition. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, believes that this matter is closely related to agricultural progress and should be promoted and rewarded. He specially ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to participate nearby. He himself prepared two silver shields, one to be awarded to the person with the best cotton quality and the largest harvest, with the inscription "Quality and Quantity," and the other to be awarded to the person who raised the best draught cattle, with the inscription "Healthy and Strong." Yesterday, Director Zou and Deputy Director Cai of the bureau attended the ceremony and presented the awards on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Zhu Shiming, Sent to Europe and America for Observation, is Recalled to China</h3>
<p>He is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Zhu Shiming, the former Commander of Bandit Suppression and concurrently Director of the Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province, has made outstanding achievements in bandit suppression, communist suppression, and military industrial education since taking office. The people of Zhejiang still praise him to this day. Zhu is an engineer who studied in the United States and graduated from Norwich University. He has profound academic knowledge and is one of the few military scientists in the country. Last winter, Zhu was ordered by the National Government to go to Europe and America for observation. He has visited countries such as England, France, Germany, and Italy, and has studied in detail the military system reforms and the invention of new weapons in those countries. This time, as the violent Japan forcibly occupies the Northeast and national defense is in an emergency, it is heard that Zhu has been recalled and departed from Berlin on October 19th to return to China. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>The Two Seafarer's Unions on the River and at Sea Will Merge</h3>
<p>The Inland River Steamboat Seafarers' Union and the Shanghai Seafarers' Union</p>
<p>The Reorganization Committee of the All-China Seafarers' Union yesterday ordered the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Seafarers' Union, stating that according to the union's submission on its organizational situation, it requested to determine the organization before the reorganization period in order to facilitate union affairs. The committee has already signed its opinions and submitted them together with the union's second submission to the central government for approval. The central government issued instruction No. 18085, (omitted)... The union should immediately send three loyal and capable representatives to the committee for discussion. The committee will select them and send a letter to the municipal party department to appoint them as responsible members for the reorganization, merging with the Shanghai Seafarers' Union for reorganization. This matter concerns the union's future reorganization. Please do not delay. (omitted)</p>
<h3>The Lianxing Ship is Still Difficult to Extract from the Shallows</h3>
<p>The Lianxing ship of the Zhaoxing Company, which originally sailed on the Northern Seas, was rented by the Transportation Department and changed to the Yangtze River. Because the ship's draft was too deep, it ran aground on the ninth of last month, ten miles downstream of Hukou. Later, because the bottom of the ship was deeply embedded in the sand, it was impossible to extract it. The crew members have all left the ship and come to Shanghai. The results of the current survey show that it is necessary to wait for the river water to recede, and the bureau will send workers to the site of the accident to excavate the sand under the bottom of the ship and introduce water before it can be towed. It is impossible to pull it out for a while.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Sand Transporters Request Exemption from Sanitary and Epidemic Prevention Dues</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fishing Boat Sand Transporters Association, because the Seaport Quarantine Office forcibly collects sanitary and epidemic prevention dues and freely detains merchants, yesterday submitted a petition to the municipal party department requesting exemption from the dues and strict handling of the matter. The original text states: "Our association has recently received reports from members such as Wu Shungui and others that the National Seaport Quarantine Office has sent three people, Westerners and Chinese, to forcibly collect sanitary and epidemic prevention dues of three yuan or two yuan per boat, either issuing receipts or not issuing receipts, as they wish. If there is any resistance, they will be detained. However, there is no sanitary and epidemic prevention liquid poured into the boats. They are merely using the name of hygiene and epidemic prevention to extort large sums of money. Our industry already bears a heavy responsibility for dues. How can we endure this disturbance again? Moreover, the free detention of merchants is not a law that a democratic country should have. We hereby submit a document requesting your department to quickly punish them and exempt us from this sanitary and epidemic prevention due in order to maintain commercial hardship."</p>
<h3>The Corpse Chopped by Knives is Named Wang Genrong</h3>
<p>Three Suspects were Detained but Did Not Confess</p>
<p>A man was chopped down on the road on Huining Road in the South City a few days ago. There was also a hemp rope around his head and neck. The patrolling police sent him to Shanghai Hospital, where he died immediately. The local court sent personnel to verify and collect the body. Now, Cao Junda and other detectives from the Second District Police Station have investigated and found that the deceased was named Wang Genrong, 25 years old, from Shaoxing. He was a plasterer and was killed by Chang Bing and Atu Meibing. Therefore, Atu Meibing was arrested, and weapons such as bayonets and hammers were seized and detained. However, the defendants all cunningly refused to confess. It was found that the deceased had a younger brother named Wang Gengsheng, who was a painter in the Shaoxing Guild Hall. He was summoned for questioning, but he also claimed not to know. The local guarantor Dong Jianqing took the corpse to the court for his younger brother to claim. The defendants were ordered to wait for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Too Much Milk Kills a Child</h3>
<p>The Wet Nurse is Acquitted</p>
<p>The two-month-old baby boy, Xiaomao, of Li Feng, a Henan woman who runs a pancake shop at No. 184 Tangshan Road, was accidentally suffocated by the Jiangbei wet nurse Wu Liu while breastfeeding and falling asleep at 7 p.m. on the 10th of this month. Her husband, Li Xueming, was over thirty years old and had just had this son. He was extremely distraught and reported the matter to the police, who arrested Wu Liu and sent her to the First Special District Court, accusing her of intentional homicide. The court ordered that the cause of the baby's death be verified before further review. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiebin presided over the third criminal court for a continued hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer from the police station, stated that after the forensic examination, it was verified that the baby was indeed choked to death by the defendant's excessive milk, which could not circulate in time, so he suffered this misfortune. It had nothing to do with her, and he requested that she be released. Judge Xiao approved it and immediately declared her not guilty and released her.</p>
<h3>The Wife of a Servant Firmly Asks for a Divorce</h3>
<p>The Judge's Mediation is Ineffective and He Has to Set a Date for Sentencing</p>
<p>Li Yingui, a Fujian native who works as a servant at the Racecourse, is 32 years old. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, he married Pan Meilin, a local woman, through a matchmaker. They lived together at No. 3 Renheli, Meibaige Road, Xinzha, for nearly seven years. Their relationship was very close, and they had two sons, the eldest of whom is six years old. Recently, Pan hired lawyer E Sen to file a petition with the mediation court of the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Li. The reason stated that she had been repeatedly abused and beaten by her husband, causing her unbearable suffering, and therefore requested a divorce. The Special Court has already held a hearing for mediation, but the result was unsuccessful. Pan then formally filed a lawsuit for divorce, and Li Yingui also hired lawyer Zhang Ji to file a counterclaim, requesting that they be ordered to live together. Yesterday morning, Zhou Daren, the head of the civil court, presided over the eighth court for trial. Both parties went to court with their respective lawyers. Pan Meilin stated that she is 21 years old and married the defendant Li Yingui at the age of 15. They have lived together for seven years and have experienced all kinds of abuse. Last year, she was beaten by the defendant and was so angry that she sought death and swallowed goddess pills. Later, her father came to rescue her, and she was able to be reborn. On the 17th of last month, because of a lack of household expenses, she asked the defendant for money, which angered him. He immediately used force, punching her in both arms and body, and throwing a wooden stool to injure her feet. She went to Renji Hospital and the Procuratorate of your court to verify that the injuries were real and filed a injury report. Li Yingui stated that he is from Fujian. Because his family was poor, he came to Shanghai to make a living at a young age. Later, he married Pan as his wife. For seven years, he has taken care of her very much. They have two sons, the eldest of whom is six years old and the youngest is four years old. Later, the plaintiff's behavior was improper. She often sang loudly during the day and went out to study in the evening, returning late at night. She met a group of sisters and was persuaded by them. I have questioned her, saying that such behavior is not appropriate at home, but the plaintiff has always been stubborn. Now she has filed a case requesting a divorce. You must know that it is not easy to marry a wife with a small business. Moreover, since the plaintiff left, all two sons have no support. They are now entrusted to the Yue family to raise them. There have been quarrels between our husband and wife, but there has been no beating. As for the injuries on her body, it was because she was careless when drying clothes on the drying rack one day and fell off the ladder. Now I do not want a divorce and request that they be ordered to live together. Judge Zhou then advised Pan to try to live with Li again. If there are any more abusive incidents, then she can file for divorce at that time. However, Pan's attitude was firm and she vowed not to live together. Then the two lawyers, E Sen and Zhang Ji, rose and argued. Finally, prosecutor Li Ying expressed his opinion, stating that the plaintiff was abused and beaten by the defendant. This is a fact and there is no doubt about it. However, since the two parties have already had opinions, even if they are forced to live together, it will be useless. Therefore, he said that he agreed with the plaintiff's request and granted a divorce. Judge Zhou announced that the debate on the case was over and that the judgment would be announced at 9:00 a.m. on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Exhibition in Xiaoguan Garden</h3>
<p>Xiaoguan Garden in Jiangwan has always been known for its chrysanthemums. Yesterday was the first day of the garden's public exhibition of chrysanthemums. Nearly 400 kinds of chrysanthemums were on display, all of which were rare and difficult to see elsewhere. The arrangement and order are completely different from ordinary chrysanthemum shows. There are chrysanthemum mountains of more than ten feet square, and hundreds of different kinds of specimen chrysanthemums.

She had two small braids and no shoes or socks on her feet. She was lost there. He immediately took her back to the station.

As for the origin of its 4711 trademark, it is because the factory was originally located on Golden Bell Street in Cologne, Germany, on the Rhine River, with the address number 4711, so it was used as the trademark for 4711 cosmetics.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhongxia's News</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Economic Boycott Association decided that Japanese goods could be freely sold after registration. At this time of the most intense Japanese disaster, there is such a reactionary measure, and on the one hand, oaths are made to ban purchases, and on the other hand, they are sold openly. How can this be justified? Zhongxia also has an article on this and hopes to publish it.</p>
<h3>Zhongxia's Letter to the Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Unlimited Sales of Sealed Japanese Goods is Tantamount to Announcing the Death Penalty for the Boycott Movement</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Design Association is currently discussing ways to deal with sealed Japanese goods. I once wrote an article lamenting that sealed Japanese goods should not be sold immediately, which was published in the Shenbao and the Min Guo Daily, but it does not seem to have attracted social attention. Now I will excerpt a section for your review. Today, the business community's Economic Boycott Association announced five articles on how to deal with sealed Japanese goods. What I have been worried about day and night has unfortunately come true. The reason for the failure of previous boycotts of Japanese goods was the mistaken unlimited sale of Japanese goods that had already entered the country. During the boycott period, it was vigorous and the source of Japanese goods was temporarily cut off, but there were still many stocks on the market, which could meet the needs of the moment. (Before each boycott, merchants rush to import a large batch of Japanese goods in advance, so they don't have to worry about not having goods to sell for several months.) When the stock is about to be cleared, the boycott is invisibly cancelled, and a large amount of Japanese goods can be imported again to make up for the shortage of Japanese goods on the market. Therefore, Japanese imports must increase greatly before the boycott, and Japanese imports must also increase greatly after the boycott. In the long run, Japanese imports have never decreased compared to normal years. The running and shouting for several months, and all kinds of efforts, have not yielded half an effect. Thinking about it is very painful. If the goods sealed this time can be preserved until the boycott is over, and then put up for sale, then the Japanese goods on the market will suddenly increase, and there is no need to import a large batch from the Japanese side. During the boycott period, Japanese goods disappeared from the market, and their sales were seized by Western goods or domestic goods. The Japanese people's losses cannot be compensated in this way. In this way, a one-year boycott will have the effect of one year, and a two-year boycott will have the effect of two years, and it will not be completely empty as in the past. Even for the sake of preserving the cost of merchants, the goods imported before the boycott cannot be sealed forever. If it is absolutely necessary, there are also compromise methods to take care of both sides. How can we rashly unload the sealed goods on the market and ruin the future of the boycott movement? I have proposed two strategies for dealing with sealed goods: (1) Concentrate and publicly sell them after half a year, and allow merchants to use these stocks as collateral; (2) Sell them with restrictions, for example, goods that can normally be sold in one month should be sold in four months, selling one-quarter each month. In this way, three-quarters of the Japanese goods market is seized by other countries' goods. The second method seems easier to implement. The most incomprehensible thing about the measures proposed by the Economic Boycott Association is that goods imported after the boycott are also allowed to be sold. Then what is the point of the boycott? The Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association was established as early as July 24. Goods imported after this are clearly taking advantage of the fact that the boycott has not been universally implemented to take advantage of the opportunity to make profits. Such merchants are not worth cherishing. After the September 18 Incident in Shenyang, private imports of Japanese goods can be said to be without conscience. Such people should be severely punished, and their goods should have been confiscated long ago, but the Economic Boycott Association still allows them to recover 60% of the purchase price. I really don't know what their intentions are. In addition, the registered goods are scattered everywhere and are allowed to be sold freely. The unregistered goods will inevitably be mixed in and sold opportunistically. "Adding a seal to each item" only gives unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to forge seals. How can ordinary people distinguish them? All of these are completely unfeasible. Please ask the Anti-Japanese Association to correct them, or negotiate with the Economic Boycott Association to re-establish safer measures. This Shanghai boycott is the most strictly organized and has achieved the most significant results. The Chinese people are congratulating each other, thinking that they can wash away the shame of previous failures and give the Japanese a heavy blow. Now, looking at what the Economic Boycott Association is doing, it is directly trying to announce the death penalty for the boycott movement. The reason why I still do not spare my bitter lips is that I hope that the Anti-Japanese Association can leave a way out for the boycott movement at this critical moment. The matter is urgent and I will not write more.</p>

<h3>Idle Words of a Tortoiseshell Beam</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>The Hunan Army's Bloody Battles Were Not Reported</p>
<p>During the Jiawu War, the Hunan Governor Wu Dacheng volunteered to fight the Japanese. The court approved the report. Wu led 20,000 Hunan troops and stationed them outside Jinzhou City. (This army was the old department of Liu Songshan and Liu Rong, uncle and nephew, and was known for its combat skills.) They built a total of ten large camps, connecting them for a hundred miles. The sound of watch drums could be heard from each camp, and their momentum was quite strong. The vanguard occasionally made contact and won many victories. At that time, Weng Shouqi was in the Camp Affairs Office. Weng joined the army as a scholar and was bold and meticulous. Every night, he led more than ten horsemen to inspect the camps. When they reached the second line of defense, it was already midnight. Suddenly, he saw a wisp of fire on the left, rushing into the sky like a shooting star. Before long, another fire rose on the right. Weng suspected it was a signal from the enemy soldiers and urged his horse forward. At the same time, he sent a flying report to Commander Wu. The continuous fires had already risen behind him. When Wu ordered a retreat, the Japanese army had already outflanked them from both wings. Weng protected Wu and fled wildly, barely escaping. The retreating Hunan army was surrounded by the Japanese army. They fought a bloody battle for a day and a night, killing more than 10,000 enemies. In the end, because they were cut off from reinforcements and their ammunition was exhausted, they fought to the death with hand-to-hand combat. None of the 20,000 soldiers in the entire army were captured alive. In this battle, the number of Japanese deaths was similar. Wu wanted to return to his post as Hunan Governor, but the people of Hunan rose up in opposition, so he was dismissed.</p>

<h3>Franklin (2)</h3>
<p>One of the Biographies of Young Apprentices</p>
<p>When Franklin was an apprentice, he mostly taught himself to read and write. One day he received a collection of *The Spectator*, a periodical, and was overjoyed. He would record the main points after reading each article. After a few days, he would write an article himself and compare it with the original, taking the strengths of others to make up for his own weaknesses. He did this work before and after work every day, and during stolen moments on Sundays. Because his method of learning was good, he progressed very quickly.</p>
<p>When he was sixteen, he happened to come across a book on vegetarianism written by Tryon. After reading this book, he was deeply influenced and resolved to become a vegetarian. It was truly news that a sixteen-year-old child did not eat meat. Who knew that this matter would be of great help to his studies. His boss, his brother, and his colleagues ate at a neighboring restaurant, while he ate vegetarian food alone in the shop. His menu consisted of biscuits, bread, raisins, sour apples, and a glass of clear water. He saved half of his food expenses, which allowed him to buy more books to read. He finished a meal in just a few minutes, which gave him more time to study. He said himself that eating less made his mind especially clear.</p>
<p>Now he obtained Xenophon's *Memorabilia*, and was captivated by Socrates' method of dialogue. He began to use humble questions and a skeptical attitude to force people into silence. Sometimes even famous people who were held in high esteem were questioned by him. He actually became a Socrates among his young companions, and Boston became his Athens.</p>
<p>In 1721, his brother started the *New England Courant*. At this time, Franklin was already able to write articles, but he was afraid that his brother would despise him for being young and not publish them, so he submitted articles under a pseudonym. Each time they were published, he was very happy to hear people praise them. Later, his brother was arrested for a month for publishing political essays that offended the parliamentary authorities. He relied on Franklin's support to avoid being suspended. James was released but still not allowed to run the newspaper, so he used his younger brother's name as a substitute. Thus, Franklin, a seventeen-year-old who had not yet completed his apprenticeship, actually became the general manager and editor of the newspaper.</p>
<p>Although James was his own brother, he treated Franklin as harshly as a regular master treated an apprentice, sometimes even resorting to violence. The two brothers broke up because of this. Franklin lost the newspaper, sold books to scrape together travel expenses, and went to New York to make a living. When the ship passed Block Island, everyone began to catch menhaden and roast them to eat with relish. Someone invited him to eat fish, but he hesitated because he was a vegetarian. Suddenly, he saw the belly of a large menhaden split open, and inside there were several small fish that it had eaten before it died. He then said:</p>
<p>"Since you can cruelly eat your compatriots, I don't see any reason why I can't eat you."</p>
<h3>Remembering Li Zhonglie of Korea</h3>
<p>— Qiuke</p>
<p>In the gengxu year, Korea was annexed by Japan. The Japanese mistreated the Korean people in an inhuman way. The Korean people dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Apart from Li Wanyong and Kim Gyu-jin, members of the Korean royal family who organized a gathering in Shanghai and declared the benefits of the Japan-Korea merger in order to sell out their country and seek glory, everyone else called out to those in the world who upheld justice to help restore their country. The Hague Peace Conference held the international balance of power. Li Jun, the President of the Korean Pyongriwon, was upright by nature and grieved over the fall of his country. He imitated Qin Ting crying for help and sought help from the Hague Peace Conference, hoping to have the power to turn the tide. He spoke out righteously, hoping that Korea would be completely independent and free from Japan's yoke. Who knew that the world was dominated by power and had long been ignorant of justice? The Peace Conference was nothing more than a friend of imperialism. Like a spring breeze to a donkey's ear, they stood by with folded arms. They rejected Li's petition. Li Jun had no way to seek help and no one to answer his calls. He thought to himself, how could he live if he shamelessly served the Japanese? He upheld the principle of perishing with his country and stabbed himself in the abdomen with a knife in the Peace Conference, dying in a spray of blood. All the newspapers in Europe and the West expressed their sorrow and regret. They said that although Korea had fallen, loyal ministers and righteous men regarded death as going home, which was also a special characteristic of the East Asian nation. Korean patriots, inspired by Li's loyalty and martyrdom, thought of avenging their country and organized an independent government, with Shen Lini as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. They sent descendants of loyal ministers to study in all directions, hoping to avenge nine generations of hatred. President Li's son followed me to escape for three years. He was loyal, hardworking, and taciturn, showing the style of his father. When my school held its tenth anniversary, we compiled the story of An Jung-geun's assassination of Ito Hirobumi, titled "Biography of the Holy Knight." Li's son immediately remembered Martyr An, and his chest was filled with grief and indignation. He had the spirit of Jing Ke and Yao Li, and his spirit was bright. He was worthy of being a descendant of a loyal martyr. If only there had been someone like Li Zhonglie and An Jung-geun back then to eliminate the Japanese invaders who were encroaching on Dong Province with their bestial hooves and bird tracks during the 9/18 Incident. China is so big, but it is ashamed of the Korean people. (No remuneration accepted)</p>
<h3>A Tragic and Ugly Farce</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>The times are advancing, but the thinking of the Japanese warlords is regressing. They are wielding the authority of imperialism and staging a farce in the three northeastern provinces of our country. A tragic and ugly farce.</p>
<p>They are encroaching on our country's land step by step, continuing to slaughter our people, and destroying the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty. They are treading the same path as Wilhelm II. They do not know that power can no longer be tolerated under the public justice of today.</p>
<p>Look, aren't those weak and small nations under unequal treatment engaging in movements to restore freedom every day? But the Japanese warlords still want to swallow this huge China at this time. Isn't that a joke about a snake trying to swallow an elephant?</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities say that they are sending troops because China is boycotting Japanese goods. But they don't realize that the more Japan sends troops, the more China will boycott Japanese goods. This is the principle that "the greater the pressure, the greater the resistance." The Japanese don't even have this much brains. No wonder they are going crazy.</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Story of Autumn Flowers on Fruit Trees in Qian'an</h3>
<p>— Shen Tianying</p>
<p>At the time of Frost's Descent, the leaves of the trees have all fallen, and the ends of the forests and treetops are already filled with a deep sense of depression. But Qian'an on the road to Northern Ning suddenly became known for its autumn flowers on many trees.</p>
<p>About four li south of the county is Huangtai Mountain. The layered mountains are towering and verdant, and the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. There are thousands of fruit trees in the mountains, especially Chinese crabapple trees. After the Double Ninth Festival, they suddenly bloom a second time, with a riot of colors and red, complementing the autumn mists and maple leaves. The strange event spread like wildfire, and tourists gathered to discuss it. County Magistrate Teng Shaozhou is well versed in poetry and prose. He suddenly felt inspired to write and composed a rhapsody to celebrate it. The parallel four-character and six-character phrases were recited for a time, which is also a beautiful story. Yesterday, a friend sent me a letter with a transcription, and I quickly recorded it.</p>
<p>The year is Xinwei, and the Double Ninth Festival has passed. The White Emperor is in charge, and the golden wind responds to the season. It is the time when the reeds are white and the rushes are red, and when the oranges are yellow and the tangerines are green. Although there are bees and butterflies, it is difficult to urge the flowering of the almonds. Moreover, when the rain is miserable and the wind is cold, who will ask the crabapples for life? This is why Ouyang wrote a rhapsody, entrusting his sighs to the sound of autumn, and Du Fu chanted a poem, expressing his feelings about the late autumn.</p>
<p>However, the osmanthus garden is cold with dew, still soaking in the rich fragrance. The chrysanthemum garden is frosted, still wanting to preserve its late bloom. Being uniquely favored by nature, it has been endowed with extraordinary qualities. Having a special nature, it therefore appreciates itself in isolation. It disdains to compete with the willows of spring for fleeting glory. It is able to be different from the hibiscuses of summer, blooming alone and dazzlingly among the flowers. What is strange is that on the banks of the Luan River, at the foot of Huangtai Mountain, the land is not Wei Qu, and the environment is different from Heyang. Fifty mu of fertile land outside the city have become a place for planting trees. Hundreds of Chinese crabapple trees have fruit that tastes better than that of Hui. Why are the falling leaves fluttering, and they are actually blooming brilliantly? In a forest of brocade, there is no sound of swallows or orioles. In a fragrance that travels for ten li, it coincides with the return of the wild geese and the chirping of crickets. Could it be that they have the nature to defy the frost and compete with the late chrysanthemums for beauty? Where do they get the charm to flatter the world, accompanying the late maples in turning red? Passersby from Mount Shang mistakenly think it is flying frost. Poets from the imperial garden almost suspect it is falling sleet. There may be a reason for the cause of the orchid and the fruit of the willow. The autumn fruit and spring flowers are especially out of sync. Could it be that they contain the essence of flowers and are spitting out their unspent brilliance? Or are they gathering yin and emitting yang, hence the falling and reopening of the powder? Imitating the weeping willows in the Taiye Pond, they actually rise and sleep three times. Is it not like the rice harvested by the farmer in Langya, who can reap and harvest again and again? Is it good or bad? Is it auspicious or ominous? The matter is already abnormal, and doubts are ultimately difficult to dispel. If we consider it auspicious, then the country is troubled and worries are pressing. Looking south to Jianghuai, it has become a vast expanse of water. Looking east to Liaoshen, it is being devoured by strong neighbors. In this time of disaster, how can there be omens of good fortune? If we say that it is not auspicious, then Shaozhou has mistakenly been entrusted with the people and society, serving as the magistrate of Lingzhi. Let all misfortunes and calamities gather on my body. Please do not let any disasters or omens befall the common people. Perhaps personal selfishness has not been eradicated, so I am serving the law in the three areas of ignorance. If the punishment has not been clarified, I am willing to seek mercy in the five hearings.</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Comes to Shanghai Again (17)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>In fact, those ticket touts saw that the country bumpkin was a bit dull-witted, and hinted to the people around him that he was an "Ah Mu Lin" (a simpleton). The country bumpkin mistakenly thought that his nephew Ah Mu Lin was really here. He kept widening his eyes and looking around.</p>
<p>"Hey! Tonight is Mei Lanfang's *Farewell My Concubine*. The seats will be sold out in a moment." A burly ticket tout walked staggeringly to the country bumpkin, wanting to solicit this country viewer.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin thought: The seesaw games that our country children play, the acts they put on, I've only heard of one posture called "Zhang Fei Selling Meat." I've never heard of "Overlord Chopping Chicken." I didn't expect Mei Lanfang to have this skill.</p>
<p>But he was focused on finding his nephew and didn't have time to watch the Overlord chop chicken. He just shook his head and said to the burly ticket tout, "No watch! No watch!"</p>
<p>He looked across from the grand theater and saw only a candy shop. The signboard of the candy shop had the three large characters "Wen Kui Zhai" written on it.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was a little doubtful: Could it be that my nephew Ah Mu Lin has changed careers and is no longer sweeping streets and watching alleyways for people, but has become a shop assistant in a candy shop? That's right! He has liked to eat sweet things since he was a child. If he became a shop assistant in a candy shop, he could often sweeten his mouth. In his memory, the country bumpkin suddenly remembered a story about Ah Mu Lin eating olives, and he couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>It turned out that Ah Mu Lin didn't know how to eat olives when he was young. Someone gave him an olive and said he could eat it. He took a bite and found it extremely astringent. He hurriedly spat it out and threw it onto the thatched shed. He even cursed, "You're lying, trying to trick me." As soon as he finished speaking, he felt a little sweetness in his mouth. He hurriedly climbed onto the thatched shed to find the olive he had thrown away. He picked it up and took another bite, and it tasted astringent and bitter again. He said, "It's not a good thing after all." He threw the olive onto the thatched shed again. But after a while, he felt sweetness in his mouth again, and he went to climb onto the thatched shed to find the olive again. Unfortunately, the thatched shed had been dilapidated for a long time, and it collapsed after he climbed it several times. For the sake of an olive, he collapsed a thatched shed and was severely beaten by his mother. This was a story from his childhood.</p>
<p>For the sake of tasting a slight bit of sweetness, he became indecisive and ultimately suffered a great loss. Ah Mu Lin liked that sweetness. If he became a shop assistant in a candy shop, wouldn't that be what he wanted? He saw the store name Wen Kui and hurriedly walked closer to take a look. He couldn't help but be surprised:</p>
<p>"Huh! How come there are two Wen Kui Zhai? Could it be that my eyes are playing tricks on me?"</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Still in a Slump</h3>
<p>The anticipated opening of the forward gold market saw short positions posted, and the previous day's benchmark gold price almost stagnated. The trend leaned downward, with some underlying volatility. There was always a difference of more than ten taels, and people were uneasy. In the end, it fell by more than ten taels again. The market was weak from the start. This was probably because silver bars had fallen slightly, coupled with buyer activity. It then rose slightly, likely due to the foreign exchange market being apparently flat but secretly loose. This caused the gold price to fluctuate around 610 taels. There were no large-volume transactions from any party, probably due to the upcoming futures expiration. Until noon, Hengxing, Fuchang, and the Ningbo gang actually opened positions in advance, which caused the market price to be suppressed, to just 603-604 taels. The market situation immediately became sluggish. The market was closed on Saturday, and the initial futures opening saw short positions posted at 4-5 taels, then reduced to 2 taels, and then around 3 taels again. This was because long positions were urgently being shed, and people were frightened. It was found that firms such as Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, Yifeng, Bingxing, and those involved in currency arbitrage were all long, while short positions were held by firms such as Yuan Maoyong, Da Decheng, Tong Taichang, Yuan Xingyong, and Hengyu.</p>
<p>The market has fallen sharply by over 30 taels this week, with recent gold trading volumes not exceeding 26,000-27,000 bars. The volatility in the market this week has been difficult to manage, hovering around 600 taels. The highest was 628 taels, and the lowest was 586 taels and 5 mace. Compared to the previous Saturday, there was a decrease of more than 36 taels. The formal settlement date is next Monday (the 16th).</p>
<p>Dragged Down by Futures Expiration by 9.9 Taels. The market opened down 2.2 mace at 611.5 taels. Large silver bars fell by 5/16, and the silver price fell by 7/8 of a cent. Unfortunately, the underlying conditions were unfavorable, and the US engaged in heavy buying, reversing the previous day's situation. Then, Shunli and Wanxing bought in, adding up to 13 taels. Before long, Hengyu and others sold off, immediately shedding over 5 taels, to 08.5 taels. Then, Fuchang and others sold February US dollars at $36.375 and British pounds at 11 pence and 25 farthings to Huabi. Hengxing and Yuan Maoyong and others bought in, suddenly pushing the price up to 14.5 taels by 9:20 AM. The British pound quote remained unchanged, while the US dollar went down slightly by 25, causing the exchange rate to contract. The price then retreated to 11.5-12 taels. Yifengyong, Da Decheng, Hengchangyong, and retail investors all sold off. In particular, the price of British pounds sold to banks reached 11 pence and 4375 farthings. Therefore, around 10:00 AM, the price fell to 08 taels. Soon after, HSBC bought forward US dollars at $36.375, and banks mutually traded British pounds at 11 pence and 25 farthings, which added up to 11.2 taels again. Afterwards, the price fluctuated around 10 taels. There was little trading among the firms. Until after 11:00 AM, Zhifengyong, Da Decheng, Qian Changxiang, and Bingxing and others scrambled to sell off. Banks mutually traded January US dollars at $36.4375, so the price secretly declined again. Around 11:45 AM, private futures trading suddenly took place in the market. Although short positions were posted, long positions were unexpectedly eager to close out, causing the price to immediately open lower. Probably due to the impact on the market, the decline was unstoppable. By the afternoon close, the price was only 603.8 taels, a sharp drop of 9.9 taels compared to the previous day. It then declined by an additional 2 taels, to just within 02 taels. This was due to Shunli selling off. It is reported that the highest price during the half-day was 14.5 taels, and the lowest price was 03.8 taels, a fluctuation of 10.7 taels. The opening price of goods in the morning market was 11 taels, and the closing price in the afternoon was 02 taels. The quoted price was changed to 686 taels, a difference of 75-76 taels to 82-83 taels. The logbook refill fee was 04 taels, and the raw silver bar fee was an additional 8.75 taels.</p>
<p>There were no large volumes of trading in or out of any firms. There was limited trading in the market. According to statistics, Zhifengyong and Da Decheng first bought in and then sold out. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, Taifengyong, and Cuichangyong mostly had more demand than supply. Hengxing bought in a small amount. Hengyu and Qian Changxiang sold out and then bought in again. Yuan Xingyong, Da Xingyong, Futaiheng, Yuantai, Tongfu, Hengchangyong, and Yuan Kangxiang had mixed transactions. Bingxing, Yifengyong, and Tong Taichang sold off. There were few transactions from the Guangdong gang. The Ningbo gang bought in over 1,000 bars and sold out over 400 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Loose and Awkward</h3>
<p>The silver markets in Britain, America, and India have all turned downward, but the market is trending firmly, with many buyers. The exchange rates between Britain and America continue to decline, leading to a loose and flooded Shanghai market. HSBC's listed prices, except for the US dollar, which was reduced by 25 to $35, and Hong Kong, which was increased by 375 to 76.75 taels, remained unchanged for other currencies such as the German mark, French franc, and the British Indian rupee. The domestic market was weak from the start and became even more sluggish later, likely due to the futures settlement. There was no news from abroad. The result at noon showed that the British pound was up 25 and the US dollar was up 3125 compared to the previous night. Gold firms such as Fuchang had sold off again, but not in large amounts. It is estimated that several tens of thousands of pounds were traded, and approximately 300,000 US dollars were traded. Huabi Bank had a strong appetite. The market is typically quiet in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>The British exchange domestic market also had a fluctuation of 25 in half a day. The tightest price was 1 shilling and 11 pence and 125 farthings, and the loosest was 11 pence and 375 farthings (the price at which the bank sold). The opening price in the morning was around 125, going to 1875. Huabi bought December 25 and January 25. Mai Bank bought January 4375. Soon after, Sumitomo and Huabi mutually traded February 25. Mai Bank bought January 375. The closing price at noon was 375, and the buying price was 4375.</p>
<p>The US exchange domestic market had a difference of 25. The tightest price was $36.125, and the loosest price was $36.375 (both closing prices). The opening price in the morning was 125, and the buying price was 25. Huabi bought February 375 (Fuchang sold). HSBC bought March 4375 and mutually traded 375 with Mitsui. Huabi bought 375. At noon, Mitsui and Meifeng mutually traded December 375. Zhengjin and Huabi mutually traded January 4375. The closing price was 375, and the buying price was $36.5. The US dollar was equivalent to 2 taels, 8 mace, 5 fen, and 714 liang of silver.</p>
<h3>Foreign Banks Fall Again</h3>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Also Decline</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, silver bars in London fluctuated erratically, with violent changes daily. The near-term rate fell again by 3125, to 21 pence and 125 farthings. The forward rate also contracted by 3125, to 20 pence and 9375 farthings. China and the United States both sold, and China also bought from the mainland. The market situation was calm. After the close, the market situation shifted from flat to firm. The United States tended to buy, but all parties lacked sellers. According to a New York dispatch, the US silver price contracted by 875, with the spot price at 35.375 cents. The British pound went down slightly by 875 against the US dollar, to $3.7675. The US dollar fell by 2 cents against the British pound, to $3.76. The spot price in Mumbai contracted by 11 annas, to 65 rupees and 11 annas. The British-Shanghai shilling shortened by 25, to 2 shillings.</p>

<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Still Have Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th), the conditions in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange’s various bond markets saw only 3,000 yuan in cash transactions for the 1920 customs bond in the morning. There were no other transactions. The futures market was as deserted as before. The opening transactions in the morning were over 3,900,000, and the transactions in the afternoon market were over 2,300,000, totaling only 6,070,000 yuan. The changes were no different from before in terms of stagnation. The overall domestic and international situation was gloomy, and there were no significant developments. The movement of large investors in and out of the market was scarce. The demand and supply was generally balanced, but low demand led to a general decline. Afterwards, there were mutual increases and decreases, with the fluctuations only around three or four corners. As a result, the entire trading day saw only a rise of 0.5 yuan for the entire sixth issue and a rise of 0.5 yuan for the 1920 customs bond cash and monthly futures contracts. Other bond prices saw declines, ranging from two or three corners to six or seven corners. However, when the League of Nations resumes its meeting next week, the impact on the bond market will be significant. The market should be wary of other ups and downs, and it should not be as extremely stagnant as it was this week.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower Yarn Market Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very sluggish, and the situation is trending towards weakness. This is due to the numerous national crises, the increasingly severe invasion of Northeast China by the violent Japanese, the extraordinary tightness of money, and the increasing anxiety of the people. The selling sentiment is particularly strong. The sales of spot yarn are increasingly clear, but the prices are too low. A certain large merchant intends to buy, but the current situation is unfavorable and the pressure is particularly heavy, it is said.</p>
<p>Human Standard Selling Sentiment is Strong. At the opening of the morning market for Human Standard, due to the poor overall trend and the anxiety of the people, the prices for all months fell by 6.9 cents to 1.32 cents. In the afternoon, the prices for all months fell by another 2.35 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,000 bales. It was found that the sell orders were: He Shen 1,350 bales, Tai Xing 4,450 bales, Yi Yu 700 bales. The buy orders were: Yi Chang 550 bales, Rong Xing 1,950 bales, Chang Feng 400 bales, and Da Chang 400 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

Among them, fellow traders took in 100 bales, domestic merchants took in 65 bales, Shantou took in 55 bales, Zhenjiang took in 25 bales, Sichuan took in 150 bales, and miscellaneous merchants took in 30 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Weakness</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weak again, and the market situation is very sluggish. This is due to the softening of the American cotton situation and the downward trend of gold prices, which has led to anxiety among the people. In addition, some cotton merchants are selling short. However, the Ningbo guild has a strong attitude, purchasing to go long, and is unwilling to relax. However, spot cotton transactions have been cut off, and factories have no intention of buying. Moreover, the output from various producing areas is relatively large. In general, foreign cotton is cheap, and the future of domestic cotton is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Han Standard Falls 23 Cents. In the morning market for Han Standard, due to the weakness of foreign cotton, the situation was relatively weak, falling by 1.2 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold market was weak, and the prices for all months fell by another 1 cent to 1.5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 70,500 dan. It was found that the sell orders were: Yu Da 3,600 dan, Tian Long 5,200 dan, Xin Heng 5,200 dan, Yi Feng 1,700 dan, and Yi Chang 1,300 dan. The buy orders were: Heng Yi 3,800 dan, Tong Xing 3,700 dan, Yi Da 2,500 dan, Chang Feng 2,600 dan, and Yi Yu 2,200 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>Foreign Cotton Consumption Continues. Spot cotton transactions are being conducted, with foreign cotton still being the majority. The source is estimated to be 970 bales of Yao flower.</p>
<p>Mitterling 32.10 Yu Hua Factory imports 500 pieces, January shipment</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Weaken, Indian Cotton Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to the lack of major buyers, profit-taking, and a poor cloth market. Futures fell by 5 to 9 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 1 point, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton was sold by European exporters, and short positions were covered. The market situation was firm and stable. Pingguoer and Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (13th telegram):</p>

<h3>Reasons for American Cotton's Firmness Last Week</h3>
<p>Strong bullish sentiment triggers short covering.</p>
<p>Powerful wheat market and silver prices are exciting.</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 13th reported on the cotton market during the week: The government's cotton production estimate increased by more than 600,000 bales, which was unexpected. However, after the report was released, it failed to cause a sharp increase in selling, so the value rose sharply. It can be seen that the bulls planned to buy after the report, which made the sellers feel emboldened and triggered short covering. Moreover, the strong wheat market and silver prices are exciting. Afterwards, the market situation turned chaotic and presented a mixed picture. The supply in some areas is expected to increase before the holidays, and there is considerable doubt about whether the price increase can be maintained. At the same time, the optimism of general business has aroused speculation and investors' attention to raw cotton. The hoarding movement in the South continues to be in full swing, it is said.</p>

<h3>Grain and River Rice are Unusually Quiet</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, various guilds had some sources, about 30-odd firms, but the port inventory was not thick. City and rural stores sold slowly. Due to sluggish sales, the Thick Xin Geng [rice] market remained in place temporarily. Although early and late rice arrivals were few, stores on this street all took high-quality goods. The mid-grade was flat, resulting in a price reduction of 1 jiao. A small amount of Duyangjian [rice] arrived, but transactions were sluggish and prices fell by another 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha: 40 firms arrived yesterday. Changxi and Erbang loaded and transported more. Stores in this city, Kunshan and Jiangyin had the most japonica rice. Large volumes continued to rise. Thin rice such as Shijiao Sifeng was ignored, and the market fell by 2 jiao. Budu Jian [rice] was sold as soon as it arrived. There was no old or broken rice on the market. The exchange rate was not weak. Wine merchants were slow to act and retail sales were small. The market situation was weak by nearly 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Returned Foreign Rice Recovers Several Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw futures rise by 3-4 points because foreign firms stopped selling on Saturday, and the market sentiment improved slightly. The total market transaction volume was 6,000 bags, including 2,000 bags of small-grain rice for February, priced at 4 liang 8 qian 3 fen; another 2,000 bags for April, priced at 4 liang 9 qian; and another 2,000 bags for May, priced at 5 liang, which were returned from this port and sold, and domestic buyers took them in. Spot guest rice is still lacking, and the appetite of this port is also sluggish. Yesterday, Yu Tai and others sold more than 1,000 bags, and the market was similar to the previous market, with No. 1 Saigon priced at 11 yuan 6 jiao to 11 yuan 5 jiao, and small-grain rice priced at 10 yuan 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Wheat Drops Sharply by 7-8 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market gradually fell sharply, with gold prices trending downwards due to the unfavorable international situation. The importance of this key point should be noted by those inside and outside the industry. Yesterday, gold prices fell again, and the anxiety of the people was beyond doubt. Coupled with the many domestic and foreign troubles, general operators mostly liquidated their positions, and new transactions were very limited. In this environment, the outcome in the future is likely to be more ominous than auspicious. As a result, the prices for this month and December fell by another 8 fen, the prices for January and February fell by another 7 fen, and the prices for March and April fell by another 8 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Starch Drops Wildly</h3>
<p>Serious Situation...Falling Gold Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the starch market opened in the morning and afternoon, and the market for all months was in a wild decline due to the serious situation and the renewed fall in gold prices. The conflict in Tianjin has reappeared, and the state of panic is becoming more urgent. After this, the sales in the north will inevitably be greatly affected. The bulls among the merchants are liquidating their positions step by step, because at this time, it is no longer the time to hoard and speculate, and there are hidden dangers that cannot be reversed. The panic of the people is actually caused by the unstable situation. Distant months fell even more sharply due to more selling by merchants. As a result, the price for this month fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, the price for December fell by 3 fen 2.5 li, the price for January fell by 3 fen 5 li, the price for February fell by 3 fen 7 li, and the prices for March and April fell by 4 fen 2.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Drops to the 10 Liang Level</h3>
<p>Negotiated Trades are Quiet and the Market is Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegrams showed that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.375, New York sugar futures for December were 1.29, down 2 cents from the previous telegram, next year's March was 1.27, down 1 cent, May was 1.30, and September was 1.39, also down 2 cents each. The price of current and future Javanese sugar also showed no rise or fall. The guild's negotiated trades were quiet, and the market's momentum was declining. The decline in Dutch sugar was even sharper. The transaction price for high-quality coarse sand white sugar reached 10 liang 0 qian 7.5 fen, and ordinary goods were 10 liang, with few buyers. Medium sand white was 9 liang 8 qian, and cotton Dutch white was 11 liang 4 qian, but inquiries were also scarce. The import and export of Taikoo sugar was also slack. B was desperately offered at 11 liang 6 qian, and HM mark was 11 liang 1 qian, but there were no takers. DY mark was 11 liang 5 qian 2.5 fen to 5 qian, and transactions were also very sluggish, with the trend still weak. The quoted price of Huaxin brand coarse sand white sugar was 100 bags at 9 liang 9 qian 5 fen. The price of the company's own ice sugar fell again, with No. 1 goods at 13 liang 3 qian and No. 2 goods at 13 liang 2 qian, with the market showing signs of gloom.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Sales are Scarce and Decline Again</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli and dried noodles have recently seen a softening trend due to poor sales in various guilds. The minimum opening price for customer goods was 23 liang 1 qian, but there have been no further openings recently. The number of purchases by various guilds has been very sporadic in recent days, so there are signs of further loosening. Yesterday, the market price for genuine Long vermicelli was 23 liang, down half a liang from before. Since the customer market is quiet and there are no openings, it is foreseeable that the market will definitely turn loose in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Tin, Autumn Cocoons, and Double Palace Continue to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wuxi cocoon inventory: Due to sluggish factory sales and tight money, cocoon merchants are shipping cocoons to Shanghai in batches. Three double palace silk factories in this port are still working as usual, and raw materials are regularly replenished. Cocoon merchants are taking the opportunity to ship the autumn cocoons and double palace cocoons stored in various warehouses in Wuxi to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday morning, a Shanghai-Ningbo freight car arrived in Shanghai and unloaded another 186 pieces, weighing 160 dan, it is said. As for the foreign silk market, it is even more desolate. Because of the telegram from the American firm on Wednesday that the white factory sent to New York, yesterday was Saturday, and there was only a half-day market. The morning still did not see any changes. The French firm is also still waiting and watching. Yesterday, only Samsung imported 10 packages of white dried silk, and Kechang imported 6 packages of yellow coarse silk, with prices still flat and weak, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metals: Blue Lead Market is Declining</h3>
<p>The blue lead market is very sluggish due to the suspension of operations by the ordnance factory and the Tianjin guild. The standard price is declining because the market sentiment is unstable and the supply exceeds demand. The current market price is 14 liang 5 qian per dan, down 2 qian 5 fen from before. However, the market atmosphere has been weak recently, and the market sentiment is unusually tired, so the market sentiment for sales has become weaker, it is said.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Steel is as Stagnant as Before</h3>
<p>The bamboo steel market is still making no progress because the construction guilds do not have large demand, and foreign firms are frequently offering spot goods. The market price is around 80 liang, which is slightly lower than before, but its trend is still as stagnant as before, because its future is still in a precarious situation.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Labor Economics</h3>
<p>— Ren Yigeng</p>
<p>Written by Zhu Tongjiu, published by Liming Bookstore</p>
<p>Anyone who has read Mr. Zhu Tongjiu's "Theory of Wages" knows the depth of Mr. Zhu's knowledge of labor issues. Now, this "Labor Experience" further demonstrates the author's broad knowledge and unique insights. As the author said, "There have been many books on labor issues in our country published in recent years, but these books either only present principles and ignore facts, or only describe facts and ignore principles. Both excess and deficiency are inconvenient for readers." And this book can indeed "avoid this defect, taking into account both facts and theory."</p>
<p>This book first emphasizes the economic background and the changes in the economic system to explain the occurrence of the labor movement. Second, it explains the changes in law, politics, and thought, and the labor movement, as mutually cause and effect. In other words, it means that the changes in law, politics, and thought are affected by the labor movement, and the rise and fall of the labor movement are affected by law, politics, and thought. Third, it describes in detail the internal organization of trade unions and the techniques of trade unions, and extrapolates from local trade unions to national trade unions and world trade unions to clarify the trends of the modern labor movement. Fourth, it discusses the methods for resolving labor-capital disputes, how to start from, to provide the government authorities as a reference for determining labor policies. Fifth, it describes in detail the latest social trends in various countries and evaluates their gains and losses. The characteristic of this book is that it explains the process of the labor movement and its solutions based on the economic background.</p>
<p>The author himself said, "The argument in this book focuses on labor-capital coordination, but the proposed methods are quite different from the主張of general economists." This is true. The author's thoughtful insights are something we cannot ignore. For example, regarding the understanding of "capitalism," the author says this:</p>
<p>"Capitalism is one of the reasons for the development of industry and commerce, and the evils of capitalism are indeed after the development of capitalism has reached its highest degree. Therefore, I think that countries with developed capitalism should correct it as soon as possible to avoid the increase of its evils, and countries with undeveloped industry and commerce should not rush to reject it for the sake of developing industry and commerce. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen divided the steps for developing our country's industry into three: (1) Before capital has been accumulated, it is urgent to encourage the accumulation of private capital. Large-scale production enterprises that cannot be achieved by individual capital should also be operated by the state to prevent excessive private capital. (2) All large-scale production enterprises should be completely operated by the state to implement state capitalism. In view of this, our attitude towards capitalism should be shifted according to the environment, so that we can avoid the ridicule of cutting our feet to fit the shoes."</p>
<p>This kind of insight is not only not a parrot-like old tune, but also gives a new explanation to the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, Dr. Ma Yinchu said, "Mr. Zhu's understanding of capitalism can be said to be a clear observation."</p>
<p>This book not only has unique insights into facts, but also the same in the methods for solving labor problems. This book takes labor-capital coordination as a solution to labor problems, and there are two aspects to achieving labor-capital coordination. One is a symptomatic method, and the other is a fundamental method. The symptomatic methods are mediation and arbitration, and the fundamental method is to adopt a factory conference system to increase the status of workers. Without talking about the symptomatic methods, let's take a look at what the fundamental factory conference system is. The author explains the factory conference system as something like this: "The factory conciliation system is a kind of industrial democracy. Its methods and content are completely different from the current system. According to the current industrial system, the management of the factory and the decision-making of foreign policies are all in the hands of the capital. Therefore, the capital is the ruling class and the labor is the ruled class. However, the factory council system allows workers to elect representatives, to participate in important factory meetings, and any increase or decrease in the rights of all workers must be passed by the council before it can be implemented. From this, it can be seen that the worker has changed from a ruled class to a dominator who participates in the factory management. What is this factory council if not industrial democracy?" Originally, all labor problems, such as wage problems, working hours problems, strike problems, etc., are caused by the relationship between laborers and capitalists. The main reason is the class opposition between capitalists and laborers. If the factory council system is implemented, laborers and capitalists stand on the same line, that is, the elimination of the opposing class relationship, then labor problems will naturally be solved by more than half. God knows how many people have said about the argument of labor-capital coordination, but most of them are empty words without methods. This book provides this proper method, which cannot but be said to be its unique point.</p>
<p>The entire book has 20 chapters and more than 500 pages. Among books on labor issues, it can be called a grand view. Other important and unique theories are too numerous to mention. Let readers who pay attention to labor issues and economic issues understand for themselves. (The End)</p>
<h3>Outline of Rural Sociology</h3>
<p>— Aisen</p>
<p>Written by Feng Hefa, published by Liming Bookstore</p>
<p>After the annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society this year, the Shen Bao editorial proposed the importance of studying Chinese economic issues, believing that before this "fundamental problem is not answered," other "currency system issues, gold and silver issues, tariffs and various tax issues" are like "branches and leaves that are not attached to the roots, aimlessly, and the results of their discussions will ultimately be empty, and will not help the future of the Chinese economy." Therefore, it goes on to the first step of Chinese economic issues, ││</p>
<p>1. The current situation and future of world capitalism,</p>
<p>2. The integrity of capitalism,</p>
<p>3. China's economic position and relationship in the world capitalist economy,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>4. Changes and current situation of the Chinese economy,</p>
<p>5. The characteristics of the Chinese economy,</p>
<p>6. Where is China going?</p>
<p>Here, I suddenly remembered to recommend this "Outline of Rural Sociology" by Feng Hefa among many works studying Chinese economic issues.</p>
<p>Although this book is named Rural Sociology, it is not the same as what is commonly called Rural Sociology, but only mentions some superficial phenomena about the countryside in a disorderly manner. Except for the first two of the six topics above, this book does not include them in its content and has not much to say about them, but it has sufficient and novel explanations for the other four issues. Therefore, the important part of this book is actually in the study of the Chinese economy, that is, judging from the catalog, the materials taken and the objects discussed since Chapter 4, The Foundation of Rural Population in China, are entirely aimed at Chinese economic issues. However, this book is also different from other books that discuss Chinese economic issues. Those who usually discuss Chinese economic issues often take the topic they are discussing as the goal, that is, limited to the discussion itself, while this book believes that the existence of all social phenomena not only has the causal relationship given by the historical continuity, but also the mutual dependence of various phenomena. Therefore, this book discusses Chinese economic issues entirely from the perspective of the entire social relationship, that is, from the sociological standpoint, to analyze the causes and effects of various economic facts and the relationship of mutual dependence.</p>
<p>The first point of this book is that the focus of Chinese economic issues is still on the rural economy. To solve the mystery of today's Chinese economic issues, we need to start by analyzing the rural economy, but we cannot ignore the relationship with the urban economy and international economic organizations. The importance of Chinese rural economic issues is not only as commonly said, that farmers account for the largest number of the population, and that agricultural products account for more than 90% of China's international trade, but rather, the disturbances that are exciting Chinese society today and the driving force for revolution, such as labor issues, bandit issues, and military issues, are entirely due to the reflection of the Chinese rural economy.</p>
<p>However, what is the force that promotes the collapse of the Chinese rural economy? That is ││ the intrusion of capitalism. "It destroys the Chinese countryside in two ways: one is the force of commodity economy, which hits the rural family handicraft industry and tends to perish; and the other is the method of increasing taxes, which promotes farmers to abandon their land." This is not only penetrating and profound in theory, but all theories in this book are not empty words, but are supplemented by sufficient facts as the basis. For example, let alone the destruction of the rural family handicraft industry by the intrusion of the commodity economy, but regarding the item of increasing taxes, we only need to look at the expenditure of the Chinese government in terms of finance after the intrusion of imperialism. Military expenses account for the largest majority, followed by the repayment of domestic and foreign public debts. The vastness of military expenses is due to the frequency of civil wars, and the frequency of civil wars is due to the "geographical distribution of imperialism in China." The source of this unprecedented expenditure is of course to exploit the farmers who account for the largest number of the population by increasing taxes. Although this theory is novel, who can deny that this is an iron fact?</p>
<p>This is just one point. This book explains one aspect of the relationship between capitalism and Chinese economic issues. Regarding other issues, there are equally profound understandings.</p>
<p>The authors of the preface to this book, Huang Gutong and Tanaka Tadao, hailed it as a work that surpasses all previous books in this field. This is correct. It is only necessary to point out one point to understand the difference between this book's understanding of the Chinese rural economy and other scholars. For example, everyone says that one of the reasons for the poverty of Chinese farmers is due to "overpopulation," but this book says that saying that there is overpopulation in the Chinese countryside is completely picking up the leftovers of the dead Malthusian theory of population. There is no overpopulation in China, but what is surplus is "labor force." What is the difference between surplus labor force and overpopulation? This book says, "For example, famine, on the one hand, eliminates the population, and on the other hand, it creates many surplus labor forces." The uniqueness of its theory can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>Carefree Chaos</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>After ten o'clock at night, although it is also a corner of Shanghai, the silence is as dead as the darkness. I don't know when the row of shops along the street closed their doors, because I have never paid attention to these trivial matters. When I accidentally encounter them in the dark night, I feel a novelty.</p>
<p>Because the streets were calm and unblocked, I wandered wildly into the center of the street as if I had lost my soul, heading straight towards the ×× Hospital. Recently, the perversion of my disordered mind and this kind of wandering, I feel, seems to be needed to relieve my heart. When I walked to the front of the hospital, I thought of turning back and going to bed to find a dream, but my violent heart changed its mind in an instant. Finally, I finally entered the small door that was open.</p>
<p>Inside the door is a garden, which looks darker than the street. To the right of the door is the hospital's guard room. The door is open, and in the light shining through, I see a figure. From him, I asked about Chen. He was on duty in the surgical clinic.</p>
<p>I took a step to go inside, but somehow I felt a little scared and timid. The death of the person who was hit by the bus that day swirled in my mind. I remembered that when he was carried to the hospital, his face had been stained with blood and was unrecognizable, and only a slight breath remained. At that time, the doctor immediately gave him an injection and performed surgery. The mother on the side, unaware of her son's dirty blood, hugged him and cried, especially "Ah Nv, wake up, Nv Nv," the emotions of crying and comforting pierced the heart. Later, he finally died from excessive blood loss, vomiting a mouthful of dirty blood at the end. I seemed to see his throat move slowly as he breathed, and dark purple blood welled up along his lips. I felt a little chilly.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Zhu?" someone called to me, and the voice sounded very familiar.</p>
<p>That person had already walked in front of me from the darkness. In the light, I recognized him as the tea servant A Rong. He was still holding eight or nine music scores in his hand.</p>
<p>"Are those being sent to Mr. Chen's side?" I asked, pointing to the music scores in his hand.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Accompanied by him, I had already arrived at the surgical clinic. The clinic was very bright. Although there were only eight or nine people inside, it was very lively because there was a nickname for Man Nv Sha and the famous Gu Yu, known as the Old Monkey. Chen was sitting on the surgical chair, still holding a harmonica in his hand. Beside him stood Miss Tang and Jin, and the other few were standing or sitting scattered. They were all on-duty nurses.</p>
<p>"Music scores, music scores," Yuan Yu said, making strange tones and funny gestures.</p>
<p>"Miss Tang, you and Xiao Chen are very good. Why don't you sing 'Love Parade' for everyone?"</p>
<p>Man Nv Sha said jokingly, and handed the music score in A Rong's hand, looking for "Love's Collection" from "Xuan Gong Yan Shi."</p>
<p>"Man Nv, are you laughing at people? What is Jin?" Chen said.</p>
<p>"Hahahaha, Miss Jin, Miss Jin," Gu Yu teased Jin mischievously.</p>
<p>"Gu, show off your skills, Miss Xu, I'm looking forward to you in my dreams too," Jin said.</p>
<p>...La la mi la... Gu Yu didn't know when he took the harmonica from Chen's hand. He was playing it.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't pretend to be crazy," Jin said, retaliating urgently.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll make a fool of myself, Miss Jin, watch,"</p>
<p>Gu put down the harmonica, clapped his hands, and did a handstand like a dragonfly.</p>
<p>"Tch, that's just like a monkey doing tricks. Gu, this is not the Jiangbei Grand World,"</p>
<p>"Isn't this a skill?" Gu asked.</p>
<p>"Stop it, it's sour," the nurse Fei said.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed looking at Sha's face.</p>
<p>"Stop messing around, let's talk about the strategy of saving the country," Chen said.</p>
<p>Although Chen seemed very concerned, it was actually a morbid expression. "A solemn person will never feel a lack of companionship." He couldn't escape his state of mind, and that's how he revealed it for a while.</p>
<p>Carefree chaos seems too numb in this era.</p>
<p>The illusion of the "Western Front War" was swaying before my eyes. I saw the soldiers going to the front line with flowers on the bayonets of their rifles.</p>
<p>The war on the Siping-Taonan Railway, I hope it will go further, and there will be an opportunity for us to go to the front line and give flowers on the bayonets of our rifles. Perhaps the flowers will be encouraging. Let's make another numb move in this carefree chaos.</p>
<h3>National Museum of Siam</h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>It was a windy day. Although there was some rain, the sun was shining warmly, and the climate was lovely and cool. We set off at eleven o'clock in the morning to visit the National Museum of Siam. In twenty minutes, we reached our destination. At that time, we didn't meet many people. We had heard people say that after this museum was renovated, during the first few weeks after it opened to the public, there were many people coming to visit it. ││ This magnificent building of the museum contains many houses (some of which are used as the National Library of Siam). The location of this courtyard is appropriately east of the Grand Palace. Each court in the palace has its own name. This magnificent palace was built for the Siamese Emperor Rama II, and the building's structure imitates the form of the Chinese Imperial Palace.</p>
