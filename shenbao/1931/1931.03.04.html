<p>時評</p>
<h3>德外長赴奥報聘</h3>
<p>德奥合併之。議自一九一九年盛倡以後雖。未能實現然其說迄近今尚偶一見之至其合併運動所以未成之故。一因恐引起外界之反對二因兩國内部之意。見始終未能一致也。竊謂德奥兩國之政府興與人民而果能誠心合作者不必有合併之名。名祇求帮交輯睦。即可鞏固兩國之勢力而不陷於孤立德奥間之交親運動。近頃亦有繼續不斷之努力。前次奥外長赴德聨歡德國竭盡歡迎之誠。此次德外長寇蒂斯赴維也納報聘。白魯寗總理本擬同行雖以預算事而中止。但此行之關係重要。己可顯見且奥國各報均以極誠摯之論文歡迎之。謂此行可使兩國邦交更形鞏固。其爲有益於兩國外交之前途又可預知矣。</p>
<p>自來國際間邦交之親疏離合皆以時局情勢與利害關係爲前提時局情勢變。利害關係變。則邦交之親疏離合亦變。今者歐陸各國之邦交不啻己造成一新局勢。然此種新局勢之久暫。殊不能料。惟德奥之間則因歷史地利種族種種之相同自應有極誠意之合作。極眞擊之交親非如他國之因一時利害而結合者可比故吾謂德奥之合併雖不必成爲事實而德奥之交親則宜久而不宜暫。蓋實有共存共榮之必要也。</p>

<p>遠東鴉片調查報告</p>
<p>對我有不利之批評</p>
<p>▲日内瓦通訊　國際聨盟會所組織之遠東吸烟調查團、自遠東調查歸後、於其造送行政院之報告書中、對於我國烟禁情形、痛肆攻擊、不遺餘力、其紀載我國道參與運烟事項、尤令人髮指、兹事與我政府威信攸關、不能任其妄加批評、且該團並未被請赴華調查烟禁、所載各節、多屬道聽途說、我國代表辦事處處長吳凱聲氏特致函國聨秘書長、提出抗議、並要求於行政院討論此報告時、中國得派代表參加討論、一月二十二日行政院討論該報告之際、吳氏演說力闢其謬、並請其將此項紀載删去、頗獲各方同情、兹將該團之歷史及該報告中攻擊我國之紀載、爲讀者略述之、</p>
<p>▲調查團之由來一九二八年英政府向國聨會提議、請行政院派員調查遠東各地種烟吸烟情形、爲將來禁烟大會討論烟禁問題之根據、同年大會及行政院討論此問題時、我國代表在會要求調查範圍、不應限於鴉片一項、所有其他有害之麻醉品、均應包括在内、舉凡産烟製藥之國、應在調查之列、方可得烟藥流毒之實狀、並希望調查團中有我國委員參加、俾易收實效、會中未能同意、當大會通過英政府之提案時、曾言明中國不在調查範圍之内、一九二九年三月行政院遂派定hkstraud,gerard,havlasa三人爲調查員、同年九月調查團出發、經費由聨盟會担任十萬金佛郎、不足之數由關係國分任之、此調查團之來歷也、</p>

<p>▲不實之紀載迨該團在遠東調查竣事、所作之遠東吸烟情形報告書迄不宣佈、至今年一月行政院開會之前數日、始行發布、經細加核閱、其中果有攻擊我國之紀載、「中國自一九○六年禁烟以來、至一九一七年及一九一八年間、國内種烟頗有禁絶希望、嗣後國内情形變化、烟禁廢弛、遂回復一九○六年以前狀態、至一九一八年南京政府頒布各種禁烟法令、並未收得所期望之結果、據本團所得消息、當本團赴遠東調查之時、中國種吸情形、較之己往之二十年中尤爲惡劣、對於其他遠東各處禁烟影響甚大、尤有甚者、中國省政府甚至國民政府、曾直接參預鴉片事件、一九二七年年底安南政府接得南京財政部長及雲南省政府之請求、請准許將雲南所産烟土運往廣東、經過安南東京地方、該項烟土分量第一次爲三百噸、第二次爲五百噸、據中國財政部長聲稱、此項烟土係爲救濟之用、至於中國各地禁烟機關、均經發現有運烟進口及分銷等情事、而以其用途係爲醫治烟癮爲言···」、此外間接攻擊我國之處尚多、此項紀載影響我國國際信用甚鉅、凡我國人應同爲努力厲行烟禁、使鴉片流毒得早盡絶要有株、以免外人再有所藉口也、公電</p>

<h3>紅薇感舊說鈍安</h3>
<p>— 阿丹</p>
<p>昨得亞子書。謂社友傅屯艮病殁安慶客次。南社同文。又弱一個聞耗之餘。感傷曷似、屯艮湖南醴陵人。原名熊湘旋更名專、工詩古文。早歳致力革命。與寗太一陳蛻菴諸人相友善。洞庭波雜志之輯君與其力。丙丁萍鄉事敗。寗被逮。清吏迹之甚。遁走海上。癸丑湯薌銘督湘。大索黨人。榜列君劍名。乃由長沙奔醴陵。望門投止。親友無敢納。狀極窘迫。有妓黄玉嬌者。綺年玉貌。性慷慨。有俠女風、屯艮以張祿變名。效尋春杜牧。龔芥彌黄栩園偕行。因匿玉嬌家。玉嬌一見傾心。然察其落魄殊甚。詢之。知爲黨人。益敬愛。慨然營寗室以居之。一切供給。玉嬌主之。屯艮德甚。誓有以報。閱旬日。偵者稍懈。遂潛遁去。事解。訪之己盡室遷徙。不知所之。問之里人。或云己嫁。或云己死。難得確耗。屯艮悒悒竟月。爲作紅薇感舊記以傳其事。海内同文。多有題詠。附圖有二。則爲黄賓虹蔡哲夫所作也</p>
<p>屯艮嘗授徒王仙鎭。鎭以仙人王子喬得名。玉嬌二字。略去點畫。亦適爲王喬。因悟人生遇合。别有因緣。紅薇感舊。聊寫恩怨。故號紅薇生。又聞上海有王鈍根者。與所署雷同。致書鈍根。結爲文友。而己則改稱鈍安。或簡寫屯艮。</p>
<p>屯艮頻年以來。曾任省署秘書。省會議員。沅江縣長。中山圖書館長等職。去年長沙兩次遭刦。圖書萬卷。悉成灰燼。逃難至漢。塵垢滿身。同事皆不相識。旋養疴匡廬小天池。無何。九江告急。遁安慶。疾益加劇。秘不語人。日且寫字賦詩以爲樂。臨終前夕。尚爲鄒秋士書聨。乃集定菴詩句。「安排寫集三千卷。料理看山五十年」云。</p>
<p>屯艮曾遊西湖。至宋莊。登景蘇閣。園丁獻荷花二枝。笑謂同游者曰。吾異日當來此閣爲神。二子幸以時臨。母忘供花饗我也。客曰。君將爲神。預告余。余二人亦當來伴。屯艮戲曰。殆所謂乞貌風鬢陪我坐。他身來作水仙王矣。今屯艮之死。恰值水仙開放時。不圖當日戲言。竟成讖語。嗚呼。人生如夢。誠有所不忍言者矣。</p>
<p>屯艮著述。己刋行者。爲鈍安詩若干卷。離騷章義。段註說文部首。醴陵鄉土誌。國學概論。文字學大意。瓊湖唱和集。新聞學大意。紅薇感舊記。醴陵兵燹記略等各一卷。中山圖書館目錄二卷。國文法教科書若干卷。待梓者。有鈍安文若干卷。鈍安甲子以後詩。白雲詞話。紅薇館。主漢石集聨。倦翁行卷。雲遊紀日。更生行卷。更生日記。國學研究法。鈍菴脞錄。文藝叢刋等云。</p>
<h3>前清國璽發現</h3>
<p>— 鷗秋</p>
<p>前清國璽。散失已久。今忽發現於一新加坡華僑陳發現於一新加坡華橋陳甄之手。寗非奇聞。考其來歷。係於千九百年（即光緒二十七年）義和團之役。八國聨軍。攻破北京。光緒蒙塵。倉猝間未及將國璽帶出。迨聨軍入城。大施搜掠。舉凡古器奇珍。靡不入其囊槖。國璽遂爲一美水兵所得。初該水兵不識此係何物。見盛以錦箱。附以黄絹。知必至寳。因藏之歸。後該水兵至馬尼拉。訪友不遇。斧資告罄。無法回國。祇得將國璽抵押於中國領事館得價遄返梓鄉。領事思以此奉還皇室。珍重保存。不料因病暴卒而罷。頃其家人將璽送至其戚陳甄處。托求善價售去。陳以國璽關係重大。不忍落於外人之手。流爲話柄。决出巨價妥爲保藏。按該璽係五寸方形。質爲翡翠玉。碧斑點點爛然有光。握手處雕有雙龍。所刻古篆。惜不能辨識也。</p>
<h3>古物展覽會之一瞥</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>國立中央研究院歷史研究考古組。於民國十七十八兩年。在河南小屯村殷墟遺址。從事發掘三次。十九年復於山東歷城城子崖發掘。所獲器物。均己陸續修補。分類裝置。乃擇其精華。自二月二十一日起至二十三日止。於首都成賢街自然歷史博物館展覽。又於二十一二十三兩日下午。在中大公開之講演。並以易使聽衆明瞭起見。附放幻燈。余以近在咫尺之間。關於李濟君之講演。旣先快聞。乃復於次日。爲古物之瞻仰。</p>
<p>▲古色斑駁　次日。余與張汝舟君於中央研究院總辦事處領取入塲劵後。北行約二百武即抵自然歷史博物館。館中平日列禽獸標本至夥。今空樓上兩室。入門。收票者以「考古工作概况及展覽物品目錄」一册見贈。蓋人手一編。可用以與列物相印證。用意至善。先入古物室中。内分安陽小屯村出土物品。與歷城城子崖出土物品兩大類。前者爲件四百二十八。後者爲件百二十。共凡爲件五百四十有八。小屯物品爲殷虚。龜甲。獸骨。文字。石器。蚌器。陶片。骨器等。城子崖物品則爲山束石器時代之單色陶器蚌器卜骨等。其小件皆依類嵌玻璃盒中。使人得以覘其比較進化之跡。盒旁置飾銀三角本。負說明書。註出土地點品名曁件數時代至詳。其大件陶器。則皆黏其破碎用獲其形式之美。蓋物品雖爲數不多。然裝置獨具匠心使人於零骨碎石之中。油然起思古懷國之情。四壁則張工作照片多幀。冱水村郭。譚城士丘。頗令人嚮往不能己也。</p>
<p>眞蹟鮮明　東室爲明清史科陳列所。考明清擋案。幾於流落人間。後展轉入中央研究院。乃由歷史研究所爲之整理。今所陳列者爲其一部分。勅片奏帖。皆裝漢修補可讀。鄭成功毛文龍袁崇焕之事蹟。由之可得若干史科。而朝貢之張本。稱臣之奏書。亦可略見一斑。滿清承明之後。以新朝君臨天下。於前明故實。多所抺殺。抑且淆混。乃稱蕪雜。所望於故紙堆中。整齊其志傳。守缺鈎沈盤錯之業。是更不得不渴期於此乙乙而抽淵淵而入若研究所之諸公也。</p>
<p>誠哉。如李濟先生之言。發掘古物。一在確定中國古代石器時代文化之歷史。一在杜絶歐人漢族西來之說。今古物之發掘。己足爲此兩說張目。並足以證明中國古代文化。非一種現象所造成。而爲多種勢力所凑泊。馴至今日。仍日在分合作用之中。蓋學術之興。無不本於古器古書之發見。今古器日多。而古書則日少。昔芬虞墜。異域言歸。能母一歎。</p>
<h3>婁江去思錄</h3>
<p>— 彰</p>
<p>吾太瀕江帶水。居婁水之下游。民風純樸。政簡刑清。素稱安樂之鄉。不謂比年以來。湖匪海盜。乘機竊發。綁案迭出。鄉民咸惴惴不自安。地方實力空虚。無法防衞。雖有賢有司而措治無從。前後相繼去位者。有袁公希洛。陶公牧。學行兼優。皆一時彦碩。陶公僅四閱月即罷去。袁公在任一年又四月。乃以地方不靖。爲民請命。未邀上峯允許。拂袖辭去。邑人彌切去思。袁公爲觀瀾先生之介弟。革命老前輩也。秉性謙隅。闔邑稱頌。月必巡視各鄉。體察民隠。尤注意農事。捕蝗治螟。無役不躬自率屬指導捕撲。與鄉人演講。瘏口嘵音。不殫再三。其出巡也。恒御藍布長衫。小車代步。隨從甚簡。有平民縣長之風。而對人接物。靄然可親。平生最痛恨鴉片烟。嘗手執烟犯而繫之獄。居常好吟咏。頗多佳什。擅書法。求者無勿應去任之日。觀者塞道。咸嘆息賢宰官之不克久留。邑人贈别之詩。頗多佳錄。金翼謀先生詩云。招寳山巓曉日瞳。淑江剪秀鍾奇士。記曾選佛少年塲。點額龍門爭上駟。胸次紛羅左史編。毫端慣寫蘇黄字。旗翻革命石頭城。手携金印明堂侍。（先總理就任臨時總統先生曾代表授印）朅來燧燧暗南天。恨煞魔王歪鼻子。輪囷肝膽獨包身。鐵像誅奸鑄江涘。（齊燮元禍蘇先生首倡鑄鐵像置被災各地）卅年心血竭菁莪。翻然變計流光逝。嘯傲黄花晚節香。希跡前賢學優仕。士元洵非百里才。政拙催科勤撫字。寗知綠竹彈簧焦。當今處士多横議。春婆夢覺倐心灰。飄然解組歸田矣。鴟鴞狂呌鸞鳳噤。顚倒隂陽有如是。縱令自愧非憺台。何嘗入室干公事。只爲斯民惜賢宰。斯意澄澈如秋水。黯然悵飲别東都。天涯芳草情遥寄。還看竹馬迎他年。原壞相斯更夷俟。袁公别官有作云。慚愧經年政績無。爲民求牧困於芻。守廉羣笑痴猶甚。禦寇兵曾有己夫。差幸蝗蝻不再見。疚心橋路未完敷。掛冠今日賦歸去。不及淵明有故廬。皆紀實也。又魔佛云。魔佛本並立。有佛即有魔。魔銷佛不見。世界儘迷糊。有感之作也。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（一二九）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>勃生仰光各地兒童。均有放風筆之戲。往往升於屋頂以放之。雖無甚大風律。如在中國然。亦能飛入雲中數丈。我不解其理。在中國聞人云。一過清明。地氣即不上升。不能再放。故人皆於隂正二月爲之。此地今當隂八九月。何以可放起。則不知其理也。在勃生一種小技。即造氣燈。可放空中。甚美觀。其法用棉紙糊成。高五六尺直徑之燈。（大小均可而大者升高易）用桐油繩先燒烟滿其中。可用二人手持之。免其飛去。俟烟旣充滿。乃燃燈底座之桐油繩縱之上升。燈即起。而其下可附尾。一串小燭燈隨之作尾。五采均有。入空甚爲美觀。此燈所費無多。製造亦易。看一次便可會。余在勃生。每見人放之。問之。云係閩人所爲。日没月升。常於空中飄揚。呼爲諸葛燈。閩人云在閩常有之。然余在滬未見。意者爲缅人所製。亦未可知。不過有一種危險。即若落於茅屋上。則易發火也。</p>
<p>昔在廣東日本。均見有美人化白骨之戲。每看一次一角。其法甚簡單。而殊靈妙。眼見一活美人。用光一照。忽漸化白髑髏一具。又漸漸復元。仍爲美人。百思不得其解。人云。亦非Ｘ光鏡。在檳城時。法空師多才藝。云彼能爲之。可惜未得從其學也。</p>
<p>有用銀盌來討錢者。余乍見而異之。友人曰。昔常言銀盌討飯。此語乃於缅甸證明之。何者。手端銀盌之乞丐乃非乞丐。而一街坊之執事小首領也。余視其盌。大乃徑八寸。高四寸。銀花斑爛。執盌者至各商號門前。肅以立。各商照例投以銀銅幣。不分缅人西人華人。皆恭敬布施。無吝色。蓋此乃照期照例化緣。以供養衆僧之法物也。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市銷清續疲</h3>
<p>紗市仍疲、但趨勢較軟、因實銷殊覺沉悶、而底貨未免增加、因此人心不振·業外者視需要不　態度漸向抛空方面進行故市盤在漲高時賣出且商場上稍有流言、惟某巨廠商依然拉緊不放、逢跌拖進、東洋三品紗漲勢仍烈、目前因現紗走銷暗澹、市况疲弱、但大量貿户額子一包尚示放脫、</p>

<h3>棉市平疲如故</h3>
<p>棉市略現軟化之狀、因價高後實需不動、而棉紗銷路愈滯、致各廠辦意尤懈、至於外棉趨勢亦是徘徊之象、故日商態度觀望但棉業中多頭心思依然極高、均有軋空之念、逢跌購進、始終不肯放鬆、前途仍難逆料也、</p>

<h3>英印棉業週訉</h3>
<p>▲孟買上週市價上落甚大、週初投機家購進、空頭亦大批抵補、後因新稅則謡言、有印棉及紗布出口征稅、外棉進口亦征稅之說、突然回跌、現貨塲中、本地廠家爲穏健買户、運輸商運去奥姆辣花不少、白羅溪需要呆滯、執貨者急於脫手、中國方面頗有希望、惟其交易、須視銀價而定、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>其他各地三三九</p>
<p>▲利物浦上週現銷較旺、期貨初因孟買及歐洲大陸商購進、買氣甚健、現因亞歷山大反動、買户己行束手、埃及棉亦於漲風之後、跌勢銳厲、</p>
<h3>糧食隂雨米市平靜</h3>
<p>▲閘北昨因河道　通、到源轉接、但銷因路天雨大靜、緣河斛旣難開卸、店方到市看貨者尤少、故曰　米與羊秈灣稻祗棧貨稍有成交、河貨極　、大盤一律平定、</p>
<p>▲滬南昨日到貨陸續、本街走銷祇北續微有交易、行情仍定、薄稻羊秈貨主因天雨意圖加價故無成交價格平穏、變元隂化貨稀帶堅、但市况極形沉靜、</p>
<h3>標粉市終於下落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平穏之象、以洋　報價、雖仍小二三四角不等、惟以天雨之故、人心頗形穏定、較之前日收盤上落甚微、迨至下午開盤以業外多頭、局景又不轉佳各月份均有回出大廠家則以所定之洋麥、尚有餘額依然不顧一切、頻頻狂抛、因之近遠各期遂銳落不己、觀於廠家之抛額、步步擴大此後如實銷未能繼起、又未許樂觀也、結果本月份較前日小二分七厘半、四月份小二分二厘半、五月份小二分半、六月份至八月份均小二分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥後市呈軟態</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、均見平定、上落旣微、交易亦未甚暢、迨至下午開盤、以洋麥報價究小、行家又有續定洋麥之趨勢、照前日澳洲麥之合價儘足抛售、所以一部份之心思、頓兄虚軟、觀中塲之趨勢、在洋　之兜售未絶以前、雙方之地步、似覺空方見勝也、結果本月份較前日跌四分、四月份跌六分、五月份跌五分、六月份跌五分、七月份跌六分、八月份跌二分云、</p>
<h3>標準荳餅堅穏</h3>
<p>昨日餅情殊覺活動、上下午各盤客帮進意頗不寂寞、惟大連帮與一部份號帮稍有售出故近遠期市價悉呈堅穏之象、午連電告佳、市氣益秀、結果計三月五月七日上均無上落、四月六月</p>
<p>七月下均大半分、</p>
<h3>北貨桃肉津價仍高</h3>
<p>桃肉　來以銷路平常、申市行盤較之去冬皮見降落、且漢口辦價亦僅三十六七兩之譜惟、昨據天津函息、頂上桃肉辦價仍然高昻逾恒、呌價竟達百二十元、即較好之淺色虎桃肉亦需九十元、津申市價之懸殊、可見一斑云、</p>
<h3>絲茶路莊珍眉英銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、英莊協和錦隆保昌福時等行、均有進胃、交易頗不寂寞、市盤亦轉趨堅挺、針眉秀眉　眉等綠茶、白頭莊亦略有零星進胃售價較前無變動、懽祁門紅茶、存底雖有一二千箱、去路依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>疋頭毛貨呢絨本街暢銷</h3>
<p>毛貨呢送羢、邇來本街各帮需要甚殷、公會上趨勢異常熟鬧、大半俱爲蓋印單放帳生意、其現銀交易者則甚稀、向洋行出貨者大多數均是老貨、嗶嘰及素色華特呢略見回賤、夾色格子華特呢·單白開收美兩衣布·元靑直貢呢等、市氣復堅、售盤較之上前日爲尤挺秀、</p>
<h3>五金市因銷淡而軟</h3>
<p>五金交易、在　曆年初、曾一度發展、（即俗稱元寳生意）如天津靑島烟台長江一帶、以及内地福　諸帮、均甚活動、查全市開出各貨爲數達萬餘擔之多、其間舊鐵品大五金等均大宗開出、近四五日來、客户方面、己告飽滿、需辦無多、而廠家點綴亦較前爲遜、况連日天雨連線、成交益爲淡薄、全市形勢隨之帶軟、而貨價亦暗呈鬆動、所幸先令方面、尚無重大變化、故幾種繁銷品標準、賴以擯持而不跌、昨如法西釘開價九兩四錢半、成交三百餘桶、馬口鐵廠家收進千餘箱、價英貨九十磅十六兩、一百磅十七兩、美貨九十磅十八兩、一百磅十九兩、大馬口鐵三十三兩、薄鐵五十兩、靑鉛土貨成出價十七兩四錢、成交二百担、係油漆公司辦去、洋貨售十八兩五錢、交微、洋元洋板以及尖口鐵等均有開出、但價鮮上落云、</p>

<p>▲收支之狀况　查十九年度編訂預算收入數爲六百五十萬元、支出數爲七百零二萬四千一百八十三元、内除償還舊欠五十萬元·公益補助費八十二萬餘元·臨時費二十萬元·及按照試辦預算章程·酌提預備費三十二萬餘元外、支配各機關經常之需者、爲五百二十萬元·以百分比分晰計之、市政府佔五·一、財政局佔六·八、公安局佔二七·二、教育局佔二○·五土地局佔五·三、社會局佔四·一○工務局佔一七·○、公用局佔五·○、衞生局佔四·七、港務局佔二·二、市區佔一·一、各委員會佔一·○、比較上年度預算、以工務教育兩局增加較巨、其他各局均略有增加、統計收支相抵、尚不　五十餘萬元、預計收入方面、可資抵補者、如江蘇省政府欠撥警餉協欵、除抵支應發上寳兩縣之補助費外、尚欠十數萬元、以及收回碼頭捐與南市房捐取銷二五·、年可增收數十萬元、惟以上均爲十九年度預算草案、現尚未奉核定施行、是以所支各欵、除因事實必需經專案核准追加各欵不計外、餘均遵照通案、以上年度預算數爲準、但通盤計算、遂月應支經費、比較新預算、相距亦屬無多、兹專就過去上半年度收支概况言之、純收入爲二百八十九萬餘元、純支出爲三百四十二萬餘元、（内中支撥未列原預算之救火會·保衞團·地方自治訓練所·等經常費、共約八萬元、及先後核准之各項臨時費六十餘萬元、）收支兩抵、己不敷五十二萬餘元、此外往來各欵、如收回南市碼頭等項、以航商應繳保證金抵付不敷、尚由市庫籌撥十餘萬元、均不在内、仍欠發經臨等費共約六十餘萬元、加以省方欠欵、迄未劃撥、而收回碼頭捐及南市房捐取消二五·、上半年度均未能實現、是以財政深感困難、此其大較也、至本年預算、大約可增至七百五十萬元、</p>
<p>▲組織財政會余任事之初、鑒於財局向無諮詢機關、對於地方意見、每多隔閡、乃於上年九月、呈准市府、設立財政府論委員會、延聘本市財政經濟專家·及富有財政經騐者、擔任該會委員、按月舉行常會、凡本局重要行政事項、認爲有討論之必要者、均經交會核議、各委員對於財政措施、有意見時、亦均隨時提出討論、集思廣益、共策進行、是該會成立、實爲公開財政之一端、政府人民、交受其益、至各委員關懷市政、從事會務、咸具熱誠、是尤吾人所萬分感佩者、又本局刋物、向僅業務報告一種、每一年度出版一次、所載各該年度施政狀况及收支統計、均爲己往之事、其出版時期、相距過久、關心財政之市民、每苦不能明瞭當時財政進行實况、乃康任事以來、力主財政公開、認爲本局刋物、非謀擴充、不足以饜市民之望、爰有創編上海財政季刋之舉、其内容除隨時揭載市庫收支狀况·財務進行情形·而外、更廣徴海内財政經濟專家論文、迻譯歐美財政著述、用爲研究參考之資、該刋第一期、早經印就、分贈各界、第二期亦將出版、隨當分别寄贈、請求指正、</p>
<p>▲稅收之整頓查本局船捐、自十八年十一月一日廢除包商制度收回自辦後、各船捐處、逐月收入、固有所增益、惟船舶漏捐補捐、備極繁複、爰將船捐章程詳加修正、一方嚴密稽查以杜偷漏、同時减少補捐、以示體恤、計自上年十二月一日公布修正章則以來、辦事較稱便利、於船户亦免去若干困難、至吳淞沙釣船隻、向均按等减折徴收次捐、現亦呈准一律改徴月捐、藉免紛岐而昭平允、又查本市房捐、於十七年冬、實行整理、取消總捐名目、一律改徴房捐時、捐率訂爲住户百分之十商舖百分之十四、各區咸己遵行、惟市南於十六年冬、曾以軍事之後、地方元氣、尚未恢復、由該區紳董呈准暫照定率七五折徴收有案、故仍循舊辦理、惟此係一時權宜辦法、斷無一成不變之理、爰經呈准市府、自本年春季起、將七五折取消、以符捐則、而歸一致、計每年收入、約可增三十餘萬元、又碼頭捐、向由上海稅務司代收、全年收入、約在八十餘萬兩、就中南市浦東兩處各碼頭之商船捐、收約四十餘萬兩、而事實上由江海關撥交市政府者僅每年一萬元、上年經市府與租界當局交涉、以碼頭捐支配不平、議就起卸貨物地點區域爲標準、將浦東南市兩處、改歸市府徴收、此案現己議有端結、約計年增收入、在六十萬元以上、</p>
<p>▲籌辦營業稅查營業稅一項、按照市組織法規定、係市財政收入之一、本市籌備營業稅、在江浙兩省之先、然因情形之複雜、故不惜博采羣議、研究周詳、而公佈反在其後、本市市中心區域建議之計劃、非有實際財源、即不易實行、營業稅即爲促成建設事業成功之一端、但本市徴收營業稅、抱定宗旨數點、（一）不擾民、（二）采納地方人士意見、（三）稅率以中央所窺＝　爲　率、不較各省爲高、現關於徴收條例、旅行　劃草案、業經擬訂、稅率一層、尤爲繁複、自不得不愼重將事、現正詳加研究、不久即可公佈、</p>
<p>▲募集市公債本市於十八年慶、　　發行市政公債三百萬元、原定建築全市幹道第一期工程費一百二十萬元、建設市中心區域經費之一部分五十萬元、整理舊公債二十一萬元、開設市銀行一百萬元、當經成立市政公債勸募委員會、分投勸募、旋將募集之欵約計一百萬元、先行撥充市銀行基金、故市銀行遂於十九年二月開幕、並經將從前市政機關之舊公債、擬具整理方法、呈奉市府核准後登報通告、由市銀行掉换市政公債票、以慰市民渴望、嗣因受軍事影響、公債募集、不過三分之一、直至上年十月、甫經市政公債勸募委員會擬具辦法三項、提交建設討論委員會議决、（一）己認未繳各户、分别催繳、（二）借徴房租换綸市政公債、係就前定借徴兩個月房租總額中、除去應募十九年關稅短期庫劵一百萬元外之餘額充之、（三）本市各業攤派、同時實行、經呈市府布告施行、現在辦理借徴房租、己告結束、約計推銷市政公債一百五六十萬元、專供規定事業之用、俾建設可早竟全功、</p>
<p>▲收回南碼頭南市岸線碼頭與沿浦公地、均有連帶關係、亟應加以整理、經前港務局奉令組織評價委員會、將大達大通民興等公司所有碼頭、及其附屬建築物、評定價格、收回市辦、呈奉市府核准、當經會同前港務局將各該公司碼頭分别接收、一面將應付各公司碼頭資産價值、以及津貼與償還借欵等項、統共七十八萬餘元、設法籌撥清楚、至碼頭收回後、年可收入租金及並泊費等、約計二十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>中國今日之路政與道路恊會之事工</h3>
<p>— 大道</p>
<p>—道路協會代表葉可樑君在　美國道路建築師大會之報告—</p>
<p>美國道路建築師協會。於本年一月十日至六日在聖路易舉行第二十八次年會。事前曾柬請本埠道路協會派員參加。經由道路協會會長王正廷。電請駐芝加哥總領事葉可樑。就近代表出席參加。昨葉氏己將開會情形。復函報告。並寄到關於道路建設器械說明書四十餘種、兹將該代表之演稿摘譯於後、至開會詳情。容當絡續譯出。以供關懷路政者之參考。葉氏演詞略謂。余代表中國政府。及中華全國道路建設協會。謹於貴會全體會員及代表之前。致誠意之問候。蓋中國道路之修治。本爲國府建設計劃中之前提。中國革命領袖孫中山先生。曾在其所著建國大綱中擬定。全國須建築一百萬哩之碎石路。目前我國政府。根基日益穏固。吾人採取新法。努力於新中國之建設。較之昔年。自覺易易。固不待言。</p>
<p>一九二九年五月二十三日。全國設計委員會。由鐵道部主持。在南京開會。爲期約三閱月。完成道路建設各項重要計劃。其劃定之國道系。計分本部和邊防兩大部。共計十二幹線。分四期完成。此實新中國建設之佳音。惟因大局初平。絀於經費。而道路建設。叉急不容緩。故决先築土路。然後逐漸改良。近年造路運動。己轟動全國。本部路線。業己先後分段通車。可知吾國現正努力於此項交通之提倡。以期運輸事業之充分發展。且自裁釐而後。吾國近來所採取之新稅率。對此己有莫大之裨益。汽油每箱由值百抽一·七五。减爲一·七○。火油亦减。僅石油略增。築路機亦由值百抽一○·减爲抽七·五。農機則由抽一○·。减至抽五·。祇汽車稅由值百抽二二·五率。加至三○·。貨車由一二·五率。加至二○·。</p>
<p>道路協會。本爲聨太平洋會之一委員會。主席者即現任外交部長及道路協會會長之王正廷博士。該妻員會解散後。即組道路協會以代之。該會從事築路宣傳。己引起全國之注意。發行道路月刋道路全書及其他關於道路工程各書籍。計劃全國汽車路網。調查各省交通實况。介紹道路工程專門人才。代購築路機車。解答路市問題之諮詢。鼓勵會員對於築路之熱忱。並在各省各地設立分會。要皆視其力之所及。以期完成建設全國道路之大業。該會成立以來。己有十載。其努力之結果。己有相當之代價。成就之新式道路。約計十萬餘華里。各處城市。大多拆毀城牆。而代之以植樹街道。在西北等省。該會主幹吳山。曾切實加入建築山地大路。鑿通數千年來之崤函天險。築成貫通豫陜甘長千七百餘里寛六十呎之汽車大道。昔需數月之行程、今僅數日可達。該會更擬開辦道路工程專校。及路市模型圖書陳列所。現因慶祝十週年紀念。經宣佈定本年四月在上第舉行路市展覽大會。徴集各項關係路市政之機件圖表。模型標本等陳列。以供全國人士之參覽。而促路市兩政之改進。</p>
<p>去年十一月。該會曾請國民政府通令全國常備軍隊。參加建築國道。以實現化兵爲工之旨。而期四境縱横之道路。早日成功。總之中國築路。不虞人工之缺乏。無論何時。一召即至。如貴州乃中國一貧瘠之省區。該省當局。因感築路之需要。即以二十萬人開始工作。僅經一冬。便築成</p>
<h3>公共汽車亦有等級</h3>
<p>— 吉人</p>
<p>非洲法屬摩洛哥之階級觀念甚深。試觀下圖即知。雪佛蘭公共汽車内。計分頭二三等。車廂前半部爲頭等。後爲中等。頂爲末等。係貧苦工役所乘。但其頂部狹小非凡。坐一二人己無容身之地。其危險之狀。見圖即知。該地當局並不加以制止云</p>

<p>六百哩穿山越嶺之大路。吾人今日之所需者、厥爲技術上之帮助。及機器與類似之供給。甚盼在座熱心道路建築人士。予以實際之提携與指導云云。</p>

<p>▲車頂放大　新車上之車頂亦較舊車爲長。最高之處。形同冠冕。前面圍欄之處。較爲高大。而欄中則爲　屬之杆。盛半圓形。將圍欄逐一聨絡。喇叭裝於前面。適在左面車燈之下。而减熱器之力量。尤見猛烈。駕駛輪有軸輻儿三。而舊車則有四個。以比率而言。新車自十二至一。而舊車優九·五至一。六缸新車。馬力可達五十匹。用汽塞裝在前面之引擎。係根據一九二八年所發明者而加以改造者。故旣覺光澤。又可耐久。曲柄桿亦較往日爲堅。化油器及加速器之上。置有橡皮靴。若是則雖在寒冷天氣。水亦不致凝凍。而傳動作用。亦頗有力。實無美而勿臻也。</p>

<h3>哈市限制汽車載客</h3>
<p>— 車</p>
<p>哈爾濱當中東鐵路之要衝。又爲江省之重鎭。因此人口甚形稠密。商業亦復繁盛。馬路建築。不讓於京滬。汽車來往。交通上自是便利。而於汽車載客之限制。則頗形嚴厲。蓋汽車任意載客。危險滋多。特警管理處深以汽車任意載客。非加取締不可。故於上月月杪。通令大汽車公會。略謂本處管理街市交通章程第八十八條。規定大汽車除司機人售票人外。限制冬春兩季載十五人。夏秋兩季載十七人。若係福持卡。冬春兩季只准載十四人。夏秋兩季准載十六人。早經呈請公布。實行己久。乃十八年冬間。據哈爾濱大汽車公會呈。以軍事時期。軍人無票乘車者甚多。蓋以各機關人員免票。遂致各車收入銳减。請求增加座位二人等情。當經本處特予照准。以示權宜。而資維持各在案。現查軍事時期。早成過去。而各機關人員免票贈劵。亦己一律停止。是原呈增加座位理由。現時均不存在。况大汽車乘載座客。逾越定章人數。越過重量。最易發生危險。遠如八站撞車慘案。近如第五四一號第五七九號第四八八號各大汽車撞傷行人等案。雖其肇事原因。在於司機人之玩忽。然多載乘客。以致進退不能自如。亦爲原因中之主要成分。大汽車容積有限。乘客過於擁擠。不特妨碍公共衞生。更予綹竊以掬摸機會。種種弊害。不勝枚舉。本處爲維持治安。預防危險起見。對於大汽車乘載座位。實有恢復原定規章之必要云云。</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Visits Austria in Return</h3>
<p>The idea of German-Austrian unification has been advocated since 1919, although it has not been realized. However, this idea is still occasionally seen even today. The reason why the unification movement has not succeeded is that, firstly, there is fear of causing opposition from the outside world, and secondly, the opinions within the two countries have never been consistent. I believe that if the governments and peoples of Germany and Austria can truly cooperate sincerely, there is no need for the name of unification. They only need to seek friendly relations in order to consolidate the strength of the two countries without falling into isolation. The movement for closer relations between Germany and Austria has been continuously making efforts recently. The previous Austrian Foreign Minister's visit to Germany was met with Germany's utmost sincerity in welcoming him. This time, German Foreign Minister Curtius is visiting Vienna in return. Although Prime Minister Brüning originally intended to accompany him, he had to cancel due to budget matters. However, the importance of this trip is already evident, and Austrian newspapers have welcomed him with extremely sincere articles, stating that this trip will further consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries. It can be predicted that it will be beneficial to the future of diplomacy between the two countries.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the closeness, estrangement, and division of international relations have been based on the premise of the situation and the relationship between interests. When the situation changes and the relationship between interests changes, the closeness, estrangement, and division of relations also change. Today, the relations between European countries have created a new situation. However, the duration of this new situation cannot be predicted. However, Germany and Austria should have the most sincere cooperation because of the same history, geography, and race. The friendship is more genuine than the combination of other countries due to temporary interests. Therefore, I believe that although the unification of Germany and Austria does not necessarily become a reality, the friendship between Germany and Austria should be long-lasting rather than temporary. This is because there is a real need for coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>

<h3>Italian-French Naval Issue Resolved</h3>
<p>Equality in 10,000-Ton Ships</p>
<p>France to Have Sole Advantage in Submarines</p>
<p>British Delegation Returns to London</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 2nd - British Foreign Secretary Henderson arrived here tonight from Paris. It is said that the hallmark of the successful French-Italian naval negotiations is the suspension of naval competition between France and Italy; otherwise, the atmosphere at the Disarmament Conference next February would be deteriorated. The most recent effect of this agreement is that the three countries can join the Disarmament Conference with extremely close friendship, without having to conclude any treaties to defend against any other country.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Rome, 2nd - Officialdom is keeping the contents of the naval agreement strictly secret. However, according to unofficial sources, France will have an advantage in submarines, not only over Italy but also over all countries. Furthermore, France and Italy are equal in 10,000-ton cruisers. Currently, France and Italy each have seven of these cruisers. The new agreement roughly stipulates that France and Italy can each build two new warships. As for light cruisers and destroyers, it is expected that France will have an advantage in total tonnage, but Italy will have more tonnage than France in certain warships. The needs of both countries in the Mediterranean do not seem to have been mentioned during the negotiations.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 3rd - After today's cabinet meeting, it was announced that the naval agreement signed by Britain, Italy, and France last week is satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 2nd - All sectors of the League of Nations sincerely welcome the French-Italian naval agreement, as the International Disarmament Conference is about to be convened. Therefore, this agreement is highly valued, saying that naval armament issues have been resolved by this agreement. Thus, the conclusion of this agreement has removed one of the biggest obstacles to the success of the Disarmament Conference, and it is hoped that the two countries will therefore discuss other disputes, such as colonial issues, so that they can be fully resolved.</p>

Then he stepped down from the podium. The opposition parties shouted and demanded a recess to wait for the ministers to attend.

<h3>Compatriots Unite to Eradicate Opium</h3>
<p>Far East Opium Survey Report</p>
<p>Contains Unfavorable Criticisms of Us</p>
<p>▲ Geneva Correspondence - The Far East Smoking Survey Group organized by the League of Nations Secretariat, after returning from its survey of the Far East, severely attacked the opium prohibition situation in our country in its report to the Executive Yuan, sparing no effort. Its records of our country's involvement in opium transportation are particularly appalling. This matter is related to the credibility of our government and cannot be allowed to be criticized wantonly. Moreover, the group was not invited to China to investigate opium prohibition, and the various sections recorded are mostly hearsay. Wu Kaisheng, director of the office of our country's representative, sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, lodging a protest and requesting that China be allowed to send representatives to participate in the discussion when the Executive Yuan discusses this report. When the Executive Yuan discussed the report on January 22, Wu delivered a speech forcefully refuting its fallacies and asked it to delete this record, which won sympathy from all parties. The history of the group and the records in the report that attack our country are briefly described below for readers.</p>
<p>▲ Origin of the Survey Group - In 1928, the British government proposed to the League of Nations Secretariat to invite personnel to investigate the opium cultivation and smoking situation in various parts of the Far East as a basis for future opium prohibition conferences to discuss opium prohibition issues. In the same year, when the conference and the Executive Yuan discussed this issue, our country's representatives requested that the scope of the investigation should not be limited to opium alone, and that all other harmful narcotics should be included. All countries that produce opium and manufacture drugs should be included in the investigation to obtain the true situation of the flow of opium and drugs and hoped that our country's committee members would participate in the survey group to facilitate effective results. The meeting failed to agree. When the conference passed the British government's proposal, it stated that China was not within the scope of the investigation. In March 1929, the Executive Yuan appointed hkstraud, gerard, and havlasa as investigators. In September of the same year, the survey group set off. The funds were borne by the League of Nations Secretariat for 100,000 gold francs, and the deficit was shared by the countries concerned. This is the origin of this survey group.</p>
<p>▲ Process of Contact - Before the survey group returned to Europe, the office verbally warned the head of the opium prohibition section of the secretariat that this survey group went to the Far East to investigate the opium smoking situation and was not invited to China to investigate. Since China is not within the scope of the investigation, it should not make any criticisms of our country in the future. However, the secretariat staff replied that the secretariat had no right to interfere with the actions of the survey group, but the group did not seem to have any unfavorable criticisms of China.</p>
<p>▲ False Records - After the group completed its investigation in the Far East, the report on the opium smoking situation in the Far East was not announced until a few days before the Executive Yuan meeting in January this year. After careful review, it did contain records attacking our country: "Since China banned opium in 1906, between 1917 and 1918, there was hope that opium cultivation in the country would be completely banned. Subsequently, the domestic situation changed, and opium prohibition was relaxed, and it returned to the state before 1906. In 1918, the Nanjing government promulgated various opium prohibition laws and did not achieve the desired results. According to the information obtained by this group, when this group went to the Far East to investigate, the opium cultivation and smoking situation in China was even worse than in the past twenty years and had a great impact on opium prohibition in other parts of the Far East. What is even more serious is that the Chinese provincial governments and even the National Government have directly participated in opium incidents. At the end of 1927, the Annam government received requests from the Minister of Finance of Nanjing and the Yunnan Provincial Government, requesting permission to transport opium produced in Yunnan to Guangdong, passing through the Annam Tokyo region. The amount of opium was 300 tons for the first time and 500 tons for the second time. According to the Chinese Minister of Finance, this opium was for relief purposes. As for the opium prohibition agencies in various parts of China, they have been found to be transporting opium for import and distribution, saying that its purpose is to treat opium addiction..." In addition, there are many indirect attacks on our country. This record has a great impact on our country's international credibility. All of our compatriots should work together to vigorously implement opium prohibition so that the harm of opium can be eradicated as soon as possible to avoid foreigners from having any excuses.

As for the elegiac essays, eulogies, couplets, and poems of the martyrs, please send them to the collection as soon as possible. The Preparatory Office of the Memorial Assembly knocks on Jiang,</p>
<p>Bengbu Telegram to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Shenbao, Anhui rice photos donations, resisting orders and harsh levies, have been expressly revoked by the National Government. Unexpectedly, the rice photo donations despised the merit order, disregarded the law, and resumed detaining thousands of double-deck ships along the Huai River, forcibly collecting them, and the violence was extreme. Thousands of Huaibin merchants in the winter, in order to survive, went to the collection bureau to petition and plead, but the director Zong Jian's three Zan Xinpei dared to shout orders to the guards and shot the merchants more than a hundred times, causing Wang Changfa and Ge Lanjin to be seriously injured and dying.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Report at the National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang reported on the issue of the Provisional Constitution at the National Government Memorial Week on the 2nd. The speech has been organized and published. The original speech is as follows: "The National Government follows the teachings of the late Premier and convenes a National Assembly. This is the result of the sacrifices of countless comrades of our party over the years and the losses suffered by the entire nation. It is also the only key to whether our Republic of China can ensure peace, unity, and avoid war from now on. All our comrades should work together with one heart and one mind to promote it. However, Hu Hanmin holds a different view, saying that the National Assembly should not discuss the Provisional Constitution in order to seek China's unification and construction. However, without the Provisional Constitution, the people's lives and property cannot be guaranteed, so how can we talk about unification or construction? The Premier's revolution, when he was in the Chinese Revolutionary Party, originally set three stages: military law, provisional constitution, and constitution. It is known that those who do not recognize the Provisional Constitution do not recognize the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic of China, but they do not want the Provisional Constitution of the period of political tutelage. Since we know that the late Premier's teachings call for the National Assembly to seek China's unification and construction, but we do not want to promulgate the Provisional Constitution, it is simply distorting the late Premier's teachings. For several years, we have fought for China's unification and construction. Hundreds of thousands of comrades and soldiers of our party have not feared difficulties, regardless of success or failure, have stepped forward and shed blood without hesitation. It is to seek a reliable guarantee for peaceful unification. Now, to permanently eliminate war in the country, there is only the need to quickly establish a Provisional Constitution to be observed by the people of the whole country, and the National Assembly should have this obligation. Now, Comrade Hu Hanmin disregards the public opinion of our party and the entire nation. Before the central government has made a concrete resolution, he relies solely on his personal opinions and makes remarks that the National Assembly should not discuss the Provisional Constitution. This not only loses the spirit of our Premier's convening of the National Assembly but also will cause disputes over whether or not there is a Provisional Constitution in the future, and it will cause endless disasters to the party and the country. Comrade Hu Hanmin bears important responsibilities for the party and the country and should not make such easy remarks to confuse people's minds. The central comrades have had a general discussion on the issue of the Provisional Constitution. The key is to root out the late Premier's teachings and establish a standard for our party and the people of the whole country to observe during the period of political tutelage in order to put the country on the track of peaceful construction. The overall opinion is trending towards common ground. Today's Central Standing Committee will have a detailed discussion to comfort the nation's hopes. Now, Comrade Hu Hanmin has claimed to be ill and resigned. The central government remembers that Comrade Hu followed the Premier and made meritorious contributions and does not want Comrade Hu to destroy his past revolutionary history. Where the great righteousness lies, we should plan for both public and private interests. All our comrades should understand this meaning. We must know that preserving the party's elders is to preserve the party's history." (Central News Agency Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Shandong Silk Industry Requests Relief</h3>
<p>▲Authorities Plan to Follow Precedent and Issue Public Bonds</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qingzhou, Linqu, Yantai, Qixia, Changyi, Wangcun, Zhoucun and other places in this province have always been silk-producing areas. Although the quality of silk is not as lustrous as that produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is more resilient. Therefore, foreigners prefer to use it to make single-layer clothing, and sales are considerable. In recent years, European sales have stagnated, and nine out of ten silk merchants have gone bankrupt. A few days ago, the Linqu County Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Department of Agriculture and Mining, intending to follow the precedents of Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, requesting the central government to issue Shandong silk industry bonds of three million yuan to provide relief. Representative Fu Peifen was sent to Jinan to personally present the actual situation. The Department of Agriculture then sent personnel to various places to investigate. The results showed that the silk merchants' claims were indeed true. Therefore, the Department of Agriculture submitted a report to the provincial government, requesting the issuance of five million yuan in silk industry bonds, and drafted measures for issuing public bonds to relieve the silk merchants. Yesterday, the 39th regular meeting of the provincial government resolved to order the Departments of Agriculture and Finance</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>to review and discuss again. The Department of Agriculture's report is recorded below: "According to the report submitted by Wang Deche, Chairman of the Linqu Chamber of Commerce, etc., the silkworm industry is most prosperous in Linqu, and most merchants and residents are engaged in the silk industry. However, in recent years, the price of silk has fallen, business has suffered losses, and most silk factories have closed down. There are currently more than 120 larger factories, with a total capital of about two million yuan. The interest-bearing loans of each factory from Shanghai silver are also about two million yuan. Originally, it was intended that the price of new silk would be slightly higher, resulting in a slight surplus. Unexpectedly, the European and American economies suddenly changed, and most silk factories on both sides of the Pacific Ocean suspended operations. In addition, Japan had a surplus of cocoons, which were sold at low prices, making it even more difficult for China's silk industry to develop. Due to the low price of silk, factories in Linqu have not sold their inventory, and their funds have been almost completely lost. The Shanghai silver that has been borrowed needs to be repaid urgently. Even if they want to sell out and close down, it is not necessarily possible. Currently, silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already petitioned the central government to follow Japan's approach and issue seven million yuan in silk industry bonds, which has been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan after being submitted by the Ministry of Finance. We believe that the situation of merchants in Linqu is the same as that in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After several meetings, it was decided to send representatives to request your department to petition the provincial government to submit a report to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the issuance of three million yuan in public bonds as a precedent to provide relief. At the same time, representatives Fu Peifen, etc., came to the department to personally present the details. Later, Xin Zhujiu, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, forwarded the previous situation. Furthermore, according to reports from investigators of this department, Zhoucun, Yantai, Linqu, and Yidu are the most important silk-producing areas in this province. Currently, they are all facing bankruptcy due to sluggish European sales. Based on this, the central administrative conference resolved to issue eight million yuan in silk industry bonds in response to the request of silk factories in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry will determine the measures. 5.8 million yuan will be used to relieve various factories, 200,000 yuan will be used for printing and miscellaneous expenses, and 2 million yuan will be used to improve the silkworm industry. The loss situation of the silk industry in Shandong Province is the same as that in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. For the future of the silk industry and workers, it is impossible to sit idly by and let Shandong Province be left out. Can we follow the measures for requesting the issuance of public bonds in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, and have the central government issue five million yuan in Shandong silk industry bonds? After deducting a certain percentage for improving the silkworm industry and printing miscellaneous expenses in this province, all the rest will be used to relieve various silk factories. We have drafted measures and prepared a document to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review and approval. Attached is the measure for issuing public bonds: (Article 1) This measure is formulated in accordance with the relief request measures of the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai silk factory industry relief association. (Article 2) The total amount of the silk industry public bonds to be issued is five million yuan, with 1.25 million yuan used to improve the silkworm industry in this province, and the remaining 3.75 million yuan, after deducting 125,000 yuan for printing and miscellaneous expenses, will be used to relieve the silk factory industry in this province. (Article 3) The above-mentioned public bonds will be issued by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance after being requested by silk factories throughout the province, citing the successful case of Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai requesting relief, and submitting the request to the Department of Agriculture and Mining and then to the provincial government. (Article 4) After the issuance of the silk industry public bonds, they will be distributed evenly according to the number of silk machines in each silk factory and the amount of silk produced. (Article 5) Silk factories that have already gone bankrupt and are unable to resume operations, and those that open after the issuance of the silk industry public bonds, shall not be allowed to use the silk industry public bonds. (Article 6) The interest rate of the silk industry public bonds shall still be set at eight percent per week, as in the case of Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. (Article 7) Each silk factory shall use its annual silk exports as collateral for the use of public bonds. For each dan of silk, the customs shall deduct 30 yuan (20 taels of official silver) to be kept by the Silk Industry Public Bond Fund Management Committee as a fund for repaying the principal and interest in installments by lottery until the total amount of the principal and interest of the public bonds is cleared. (Article 8) Two people shall be recommended by the Department of Agriculture and Mining of this province, and one person each shall be recommended by the chambers of commerce or silk industry associations of Linqu, Yidu, Zhoucun, and Yantai to form the Silk Industry Public Bond Fund Management Committee, which shall be jointly responsible for managing the public bond fund. (Article 9) If there are any omissions or inappropriate aspects in these measures, they may be submitted for revision at any time. (March 2)"</p>
<h3>Beijing-Ping Aviation Sets Up Station in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Beijing-Ping aviation line prepared by the China Aviation Corporation is now scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. The company has specially sent Nie Dianyi to the north to inspect the airfields along the Beijing-Ping route and prepare for the establishment of air stations. Nie arrived in Xuzhou this afternoon by Stinson aircraft from Shanghai via Beijing. Accompanying him were pilot Zhang Huayi, mechanic Yu Yongquan, and telegraph operator Wang Zhenxiang, a total of four people.

<h3>Shi Yousan's Troops Further Reduced</h3>
<p>▲Keeping Three Category A Divisions</p>
<p>▲Vehicles Will Be Fully Returned</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: After the commander of the 13th Route Army, Shi Yousan, arrived in Shenyang, Deputy Commander Zhang urged him to return all the vehicles that had not been returned and sent a telegram to the Shunde Headquarters and relevant parties to implement the handover. The Ministry of Railways then sent Chen Qingwen, Chief of the Machinery Department, Shen Yong, Deputy Director of General Affairs of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, and Engineer Bai to Shunde to meet with the Traffic Commander of the 13th Route Army to handle the handover. Previously, Shi stated that vehicles were still needed for ammunition, clothing, and rations. Now that Shen Yong has arrived in Shenyang for consultation, it has been agreed that all vehicles will be returned except for four armored trains, in order to clear the formalities. Shi telegraphed Shunde on the 27th, ordering Deputy Commander Qin Kuiyuan and Staff Officer Tang Shudong to comply.</p>
<p>The central government has not allocated 400,000 yuan for the monthly salary of Shi's troops for the second month. The central government has telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang, stating that it will be remitted within a few days. Zhang has also advanced 200,000 yuan. Shi received the payment from the border guard on the 28th. The Northeast has advanced a total of 800,000 yuan for the salary of Shi's troops. The central government has issued 400,000 yuan. In total, Shi Yousan's troops have received 1.2 million yuan in salary from the central government and the Northeast since they were ordered by the central government to be under the command of Deputy Commander Zhang. The reason why the central government did not issue the salary required by the troops was that the central government's finances were difficult and could not treat the troops differently. In the future, the monthly salary of Shi's troops will be allocated by the Tianjin Customs or by the Pinghan Railway Bureau. Because the monthly salary of 600,000 was not enough, Shi's troops were reduced twice, from two Category A divisions and four Category B divisions to three Category A divisions. According to Shi's secretary-general, the reduction has already begun, and the aftermath is being planned. (February 28)</p>
<h3>Japanese Expand Paper Industry in China</h3>
<p>▲Yalu River Paper Company Expands with Loans</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeast should vigorously develop the paper industry, but in reality, it has not yet started. The Japanese have established the Oji Paper Company and the Yalu River Paper Company. Oji is in Shinuiju, Korea, and Yalu River is in Liudaogou, Andong, both using wood from the Yalu River. Both of these paper mills prospered during the European War. After the end of the European War, the European market declined, and they had to rely solely on China. Although Oji in Shinuiju is only separated from China by a river, Japanese paper industry associations stipulate that paper produced in Korea must first be shipped back to Japan and then sold to China. Therefore, its business is far inferior to that of the Yalu River. The Yalu River Paper Mill was established in the eighth year of the Republic of China with a capital of 5 million yuan. Its business purpose is to monopolize the timber in the entire Yalu River basin and create the world's only paper raw material base. With the assistance of the South Manchuria Railway, the capital increased to 9 million yuan, covering an area of 100,000 ping. It has four 130-inch paper machines, one wood raw material machine, four steam tanks, and six water wells. It uses 1,800 horsepower of electricity and 1,200 horsepower of steam. It uses about 250,000 feet of wood annually and produces about 10,000 tons of wood raw material and about 8,000 tons of paper annually, with a total value of more than 3 million yuan. There are nine types of paper: (1) glazed paper, (2) pure white paper, (3) yellow paper, (4) Xuan paper, (5) Maobian paper, (6) half paper, (7) wrapping paper, etc. There are 400 to 500 workers. The business was greatly affected by the end of the European War. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Japanese Paper Industry Association supplemented 240,000 yuan annually and declared closure. It then reopened and was restricted by the Japanese Paper Industry Association to specialize in glazed paper and paper money used in China, which reduced the scope of business. It still lost money every year, and all 9 million yuan of the fund were completely lost. Despite efforts to economize, it still lost more than 20,000 yuan per month. However, recently, the factory has realized that after the promulgation of the new tariff in China, the sale of paper produced in mainland Japan in China will be significantly affected. At the same time, it has also realized that this is the only paper mill in the entire Northeast that can produce paper on a large scale. The Northeast Paper Mill planned by Deputy Commander Zhang is still far away, and the demand for paper in the Northeast is increasing daily. Therefore, it believes that this is a rare opportunity and has borrowed 2.5 million yuan from the Andong Industrial Bank. The loan has been successfully negotiated. The factory intends to use this loan to expand its business scope and attempt to dominate the paper industry in the Northeast. This plan is underway. Previously, the Japanese wanted to avoid paying the new tariff and planned to establish a sake brewery with a capacity of 1,000 stone in Andong. Now there is this plan, so in the future, all businesses that can avoid the new tariff will continue to come. People in our eastern province should pay close attention to this. (February 27)</p>
<h3>Truth about Fire in Fushun Coal Mine</h3>
<p>▲Local Spontaneous Combustion</p>
<p>▲Only One Worker Injured</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The fire in the Fushun coal mine, which killed Chinese workers, has attracted much attention. The central government also believes that there are suspicious points in this case. After Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shenyang, he immediately sent Wang Xingzhou, director of the Mass Training Association of the Central Training Department, who came with him, to Fushun to conduct an on-site investigation to clarify the situation. According to merchants and residents near the mine, there has been no definite news about the fire in the coal mine. According to workers living in the mine's residential area, the fire in the coal mine, which killed two to three thousand Chinese workers, is not true. Only one worker was injured. They said that when the mine was prosperous, there were about 150,000 workers in the entire mine. In recent years, due to the decline in business, there are now only more than 50,000 workers engaged in mining, mostly from Henan and Shandong, and there are very few local workers. Wang also visited the Department of Agriculture and Mining. When the news of the disaster came, the Department immediately sent technicians and a secretary from the provincial government to the mining area to investigate the truth. According to the investigation, the fire in the mine was indeed true, but it was a small spontaneous combustion in a small pit. Because the fire pit was connected to the large exhaust pit, the smoke from the fire in the small pit and the air discharged from the exhaust pit rushed into the sky together, and the flames were blazing. From the outside, it was mistaken for a major fire. In fact, it was a small part of the fire. When the fire broke out in the small pit, the mine ordered technicians to carry out closure work. As a result, the fire did not spread to other areas, and the scope of the damage was very small. Only one worker was injured during the construction of the fire wall to carry out the closure work. Wang has now reported the results of the investigation. (February 26)</p>
<h3>Ye Yixiong Case: Shenyang Judge Comes to Harbin to Investigate</h3>
<p>▲Investigative Hearing Already Held Once in Harbin</p>
<p>▲Whether Zhang Liqing Will Go to Shenyang Is Still Undecided</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the Shenyang District Court accepted the transfer of jurisdiction over the case of Harbin Judge Ye Yixiong's murder, two trials were held, but the case could not be concluded because the victim, Zhang Liqing, did not arrive. Therefore, Tang Yinfen, the chief of the criminal court in charge of the case, personally came to Harbin to investigate the truth. Tang arrived in Harbin at 8:00 a.m. on the 24th with Clerk Liang Shulin and resided in the Binjiang District Court. In the name of the Shenyang District Court, he issued summons on the same day, summoning the victim Zhang Liqing, Ye Youban, Ye's wife Peng Churu, Wang Songtao, manager of the Xie Xing Sauce Garden, Wang's wife Wang Hu, Ding Liqin, a waiter at the Beijing Hotel, Dong Qishan, manager of the Palas Hotel, Chen Zhaolong, director of the Shou Shan Hospital, and other eight people to the Binjiang Court at 11:00 a.m. on the 25th to wait for questioning. At 10:00 a.m. on the 25th, Tang arrived at the public hall of the Binjiang Court to prepare everything and wait for the witnesses. The court opened at 1:00 p.m. Zhang Liqing had not yet recovered from her illness and was accompanied by her lawyer Chi Longshi. All witnesses arrived except Wang Hu and Chen Zhaolong. At the opening of the court, the bailiffs were temporarily replaced by the staff of the Binjiang Court, and the outside world and anyone else were prohibited from attending the hearing. Even the lawyers of the parties were not allowed to enter. The order of the hearing was to first summon the waiters from the Palas and Beijing Hotels, then question Zhang Liqing and Wang Songtao, and finally question Rui Youban and Peng Churu. Each person was questioned separately, so it was not easy to find out what the testimonies were. It was heard that the waiters from the Palas and Beijing Hotels were asked about the situation when Ye and Zhang stayed at the two hotels, and whether there were any disputes over money. The questioning lasted for about a quarter of an hour. Zhang Liqing was questioned for the longest time, almost two hours, asking how she expressed herself in the cafeteria before the trip, what unusual behavior Ye had after getting on the bus, and what the situation was when she quarreled after getting off the bus. After Ye fired the gun</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>, whether he left. The clerk recorded at that time and handed it over to Zhang for reading and signing. Wang Songtao was asked when Zhang and Ye had a relationship, what the two people's usual relationship was, and whether he had paid attention to their appearance when Ye and Zhang boarded the car. The questioning lasted for about half an hour. Rui Youban and Peng Churu were only asked a few words, such as when they saw Ye with a gun, what the gun looked like, and whether there were gun photos and bullets at home. The court adjourned at about 4:00 p.m. At 6:00 p.m. that evening, Tang visited Chen Zhaolong, director of Shou Shan Hospital, who had not appeared in court to testify, with the clerk and asked about Zhang Liqing's current condition and whether there was a causal relationship between the previous gunshot wound. Whether the gunshot wound had healed. Chen answered whether he could take the train to Liaoning for investigation one by one. Tang ordered the clerk to record it in the book and asked Chen to sign. Then he called Zhang Liqing out and asked how she would respond if Ye Yixiong asked the victim to go to the Shenyang court for a public trial in the future. Zhang replied that she would listen to the court's intentions. Tang investigated in the hospital for about half an hour before leaving. In the afternoon of the 24th, Tang sent an official letter from the Shenyang District Court to Shou Shan Hospital, saying, "We are writing to inform you that our court has accepted the case of Ye Yixiong's murder and embezzlement. It has been found that the victim Zhang Liqing was previously shot by Ye Yixiong. It is necessary to identify whether the scar has healed, what her current condition is, whether there is a life-threatening danger, and whether there is a causal relationship between the current disease and the previous gunshot wound. We hereby send a letter to your hospital and ask you to investigate the above points and issue a certificate of identification as soon as possible. Please send the reply to the Binjiang District Court for collection." Shou Shan Hospital replied the next day, "We are writing to reply that Zhang Liqing's illness, her gunshot wound has healed recently, there is no life-threatening danger, the current disease is caused by the loss of a large amount of blood after being shot, the body's resistance has disappeared, and the old tuberculosis has recurred, and the body is very weak and should be absolutely rested. Chen Zhaolong, director of Shou Shan Hospital, respectfully replies to the Liaoning Shenyang District Court." It is heard that Tang has obtained most of the results of the investigation and plans to return to Shenyang within one or two days. On the morning of the 25th, I visited Tang at the Binjiang Court because the court did not allow anyone to attend the hearing. According to the conversation, the reason why I came to Harbin this time was because the victim Zhang Liqing was unable to attend the hearing in Shenyang due to illness. The case has been a long time since it occurred and should be concluded as soon as possible. Therefore, I was sent here to investigate and interrogate the victim and witnesses on the spot. Because the court was opened on borrowed land and the investigation was investigatory in nature, it was different from a public hearing, so it was not possible to allow anyone to attend the hearing. As for the date of staying in Harbin, it is difficult to predict, depending on whether the witnesses arrive today. If the witnesses do not arrive, we will have to hold another hearing to investigate. We must have results before we can report back to Shenyang. Whether the victim will go to Shenyang in the future depends on her own wishes. Regarding this case, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee has not made any recent expressions. Even the previous order to transfer jurisdiction was only because the trial here was slightly slow, and the order to transfer the trial to Shenyang was to resolve it as soon as possible. I will return to Shenyang after the investigation is over. We will probably hold a deliberation court first, because there are still three people who are handling this case. Everyone has to review it once. If there are no objections, we will open a negotiation court. At that time, because Ye has a lawyer, even if the victim does not arrive, we must set a date in advance and allow people to attend the hearing. Regarding the judgment of this case, although the court does not keep it secret, it has never been the practice to send it to newspapers for publication. We can only wait for reporters to interview. Because the legal points of this case are not presided over by myself alone, and the debate has not yet concluded, it is not convenient to express opinions. However, what can be said is that the 7,050 yuan draft has been brought by me. If the victim comes to court to receive it this time, it can be issued to her. There are other sporadic items that are mixed with Ye Yixiong's belongings and cannot be distinguished. After the case is closed, the victim can collect them. It is heard that the draft seal and passbook have now been taken away by Zhang Liqing. (Evening of February 25)</p>

<p>Case of Wrongful Accusation of Theft Resulting in Death and Subsequent Examination: Shi Er, a villager from Tangqiao Town, Sijing Township, was hired by the Zhong Tian family as a farmhand during lean years. Previously, when the Zhong family's rice was stolen, Shi was suspected. Coincidentally, the Zhang Monk's rice mill had experienced rice theft incidents. Consequently, he instructed his associates to lure Shi to the mill, where they tied him up and beat him, forcing him to confess. For unknown reasons, his body was discovered in the river the next day. His family reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, seeking redress for the wrongful death. Yesterday, the case was transferred to the County Court Procuratorate. Prosecutor Ren Guanghai led the examination and further investigated the scene. The body was still bound. The cause of death is subject to various speculations: some say he escaped after being hung and beaten, then fell into the river and drowned; others claim he was beaten to death and thrown into the river. The actual cause of death remains unknown. The Procuratorate is currently summoning relevant individuals for interrogation.</p>

<p>Adopted Son Commits Suicide by Drinking Alkali Water: Xu Zu'en, who resided in the Hedong Street of the city and worked as a silversmith, was adopted by the Zhang family of Hupu when his father, Xu Huiqing, was infertile. After growing up, he learned his father's trade. Initially, he was quite happy. However, Xu's wife, Zhang, later gave birth to a son and a daughter and began to mistreat Zu'en. At the age of twenty-five, he was still unmarried. Last June, Zu'en's adoptive father passed away, and Lei's mistreatment intensified, often accompanied by scolding. Yesterday (1st), Zu'en ordered his apprentice to boil silver bars. For unknown reasons, an argument arose. Afterwards, he secretly drank a cup of alkali water.

The bandits then rushed into Wang's bedroom, simultaneously setting off firecrackers to simulate gunshots. The bandits ransacked the house, overturning boxes and cabinets. They then entered Wang's mother-in-law's bedroom and searched everything. After about half an hour, they left with shouts to the east. After inspecting the losses, it was estimated that two boxes of fur clothing, including fox fur robes and squirrel fur robes, were worth approximately five hundred gold yuan. Also stolen were a gold ring, a money box, several deeds, and thirty silver yuan and thirty paper yuan, totaling about one thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from Zhuang Zhengyang et al. of Fengxian:</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We have read the article on the Fengxian Nanqiao Tanghe Project Court Hearing in the local communications column of your newspaper on February 14th. The surnames of the original plaintiffs were incorrect. Zhuang Zhengyang and others are all informants, and they were indiscriminately referred to as "Yu Ze" and were released on bail, which is a significant error. The Nanqiao Tanghe Project embezzlement case was reported by Zhuang Zhengyang and others to the Provincial Department and transferred to the Zhenjiang Court. The court held a hearing at 10:00 a.m. on February 10th. The informants Zhuang Zhengyang, Xu Yizhou, Zhuang Xincheng, Chen Shi, Shi Heting (representing Shi Xiangyun), Tang Baosheng, and the accountants Chen Shiqian and Tang Zixiong, the reviewing committee member Zhuang Likai, and the waterwheel contractor Jiang Jintao, and more than ten other people arrived. The defendants, Jiang Rongchu and Zhang Hong, were temporarily brought in for interrogation. As a result, the two directors, Jiang and Zhang, were returned to custody, the accountant Chen Shiqian was released on bail, and other witnesses were ordered to leave the court, and there was no bail. We hereby make a factual correction and respectfully request that it be published in the "Letters" column to clarify the facts. Zhuang Zhengyang, Zhuang Xincheng, Xu Yizhou, Chen Shi, February 20th.</p>

<h3>Outline of Construction Projects in Shaanxi Province in the 20th Year of the Republic of China (Continued):</h3>
<p>▲ Drafted by the Shaanxi Provincial Government</p>
<p>(B) Establishment of the Xi'an Machine Factory: The existing machine repair factory will be reorganized and expanded to manufacture agricultural implements and household utensils, and to repair various machines and automobiles. The planned renovation requires 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Establishment of the Yellow River Longmen Hydroelectric Power Plant and the Luo River Yantou Hydroelectric Power Plant: The establishment of these two plants will completely electrify the vast areas of Guanzhong and Hedong. However, a thorough study has not yet been conducted. This year, a field survey is planned to facilitate design. In addition, if leather factories, woolen textile factories, flour mills, etc., are established after the realization of the original power or convenient transportation, merchants will naturally compete to do so. The government can only promote it.</p>
<p>5. Regarding mining and metallurgy, in addition to urging the Yanchang Petroleum Official Factory to drill more new wells this year to increase production, major development still requires Chinese and foreign financial resources. Regarding the Shenmu official coal inspection, a major reorganization is planned this year to expand the market. As for the coal and iron mines, the reserves in the north and south mountains are not always rich and all need to be investigated and verified before a plan can be implemented. The mining and metallurgical affairs planned for this year are divided as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Yanchang Petroleum Factory: The current wells that produce the most crude oil in the factory are the old well No. 1 and the new well No. 1. The total output of the two wells is 1,000 jin of crude oil per day. To expand the output, more wells must be drilled. The factory buildings can still be used. However, all the tools are old items that have been used for many years, which are not only clumsy but also extremely dangerous. It is planned to repair the machinery extensively first and purchase various parts, which will cost more than 8,000 yuan. The coal used by the factory comes from Shima, which is 60 li southwest of the factory. The road is rugged, and camels and mules are used to transport the coal. The factory's coal consumption is about 2,000 jin per day normally. If new wells are drilled, 6,000 jin or more will be required. It is planned to turn the mountain road from the factory to Shima into a car road so that large trucks can be used to transport coal, which saves time and expense. The planned cost is more than 3,000 yuan. Both matters are planned to be handled within this year. The factory is still continuing to drill. After the fourth oil well is completed, it will continue to drill. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders All Provinces and Cities to Report on Social Education Matters:</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education sent a notice to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to report social education matters to the ministry within one month of receiving the notice for evaluation purposes.

Provinces and cities that have not yet submitted reports must make up for them immediately. Those who have submitted a portion of the report should check and make up for any missing portions in addition to the submitted portion. The deadline for this supplementary report is one month from the date of receipt of this document. Hereafter, all reporting deadlines should be complied with on time without further delay. This is of utmost importance.

<h3>Educational Policy Guidelines for Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan Correspondence) Director Feng Sizhi of the Education Department has recently made a determination regarding education in Shanxi, resolving to exert all efforts and actively make thorough reforms. He has already drafted a document titled "Educational Policy Guidelines for Shanxi Province," which is scheduled to be presented at today's provincial government meeting for discussion, and will then serve as the standard for future policy implementation. The text is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Educational Policy Guidelines for Shanxi Province: These guidelines are based on the educational objectives and implementation policies passed by the National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang on March 25, 1929, the "National Education Reform Plan" resolved at the National Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education in May 1930, and have been formulated with consideration for the unique circumstances of Shanxi society. (A) Regarding School Education: 1. Establish a School Education Design Committee to research and innovate school education programs in Shanxi. 2. Order all levels of schools throughout the province to increase the teaching of Party ideology, aiming to integrate the knowledge and morality of all students in the province under the Three Principles of the People to achieve genuine belief and diligent practice. 3. Vigorously promote women's education to ensure equal educational opportunities for both men and women, while emphasizing the cultivation of women's sound morality and preserving their unique feminine qualities to build a good family life and social life. 4. All levels of schools should uniformly emphasize physical education to cultivate a strong spirit and develop disciplined habits. 5. Kindergarten education: Each city and county throughout the province should, as a principle, establish at least one class each. Private establishments will receive appropriate subsidies from city and county governments, but must be established by Chinese individuals and employ Chinese teachers only. 6. Elementary education: (a) All existing 22,000+ primary schools in the province should focus on qualitative improvement to ensure the soundness of basic education. (b) All 400,000+ school-aged children in the province who have not yet entered school should have the opportunity to receive four years of compulsory education, during which tuition fees may be appropriately waived.

<h3>Regulations for Preliminary Entrance Examinations for Graduates of Unregistered Private Senior High Schools</h3>
<p>Last summer, the Ministry of Education held preliminary entrance examinations for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools. Because this was an initiative, many people were cautious and hesitant, resulting in few applicants and a limited number of those admitted. Later, various public and private universities reported the status of new students, and it was found that some admitted graduates from unregistered schools. The Ministry of Education refuted this and canceled their admission qualifications. Requests for flexibility from provincial and municipal education departments were also not permitted. This matter is not merely a bureaucratic formality but will be strictly enforced. Therefore, many provinces and cities requested relief. Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau requested permission to hold another preliminary entrance examination for graduates of unregistered private senior high schools in July of this year, following the previous example. The Ministry of Education, in addition to instructing the bureau to approve this, also ordered all provincial and municipal education departments to uniformly hold an examination on July 1, and to develop examination regulations based on the principles of the preliminary entrance examination regulations issued by the Ministry of Education last year and submit them to the Ministry for record. The original text of the regulations is as follows: "Principles of the Preliminary Entrance Examination Regulations for Graduates of Unregistered Private Senior High Schools: (1) Establish an examination committee composed of one chairman and six to ten members. (2) The head of the provincial or municipal education administrative agency shall be the ex officio chairman. The members shall be appointed or hired by the provincial or municipal education administrative agency from among current education administrators and principals and teachers of current public or registered private high schools or higher. However, the number of administrative personnel shall not exceed one-third of the number of principals and teachers. (3) The examination subjects shall be based on the curriculum of public senior high schools or equivalent schools. (4) This examination shall be held in the location of the provincial or municipal government. (5) Those who pass the examination shall be given a certificate of admission to higher education, and those who fail shall be given a certificate of transfer to a lower grade according to their level." The aforementioned certificate of admission to higher education shall state: "(This certificate is only for admission to higher education and shall not be used for proving other qualifications)." The same shall apply to the certificate of transfer. (6) Graduates of vocational schools who have completed three years of study after graduating from junior high school shall be permitted to register for the examination.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest at Anhui University</h3>
<p>▲Students Attack the Chief of General Affairs</p>
<p>At around 12:00 PM on the day before yesterday (February 26), students such as Xie Yinrong, incited by expelled students such as Wu Zhaoshu, stormed into the dormitory of Xue Liangshu, the Chief of General Affairs of Anhui University, arbitrarily insulting and berating him, and forcing him to leave the school. Later, when Xue reached near Baihua Pavilion, five people, including Wu Zhaoshu, ambushed him there, hitting him head-on, smearing him with mud, and snatching away Xue's glasses. Fortunately, a police officer noticed this and stopped them, saving Xue from danger. After receiving this news, the school immediately convened an emergency school affairs meeting and an administrative meeting, which resolved to express condolences to Xue Liangshu in the name of the school affairs meeting, and sent representatives to visit Chairman Chen to report the incident. The Chairman was extremely angry at the outrageous academic atmosphere and immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest and investigate the previously expelled student Wu Zhaoshu and others, and ordered the school to expel the students involved in this incident, and have the Public Security Bureau send police to escort them out of the province. Now the school has complied with the order and announced the expulsion of Xie Yinrong, Li Yilei, Yao Jing, Xu Yuanyu, Hao Suzhi, Luo Guanhua, Liu Yiqun, Li Yida, Du Jizhou, Miao Haiming, Hong Gen, and eleven other students who caused the disturbance.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Director Xu of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Discusses the District Issues of the Municipal Education Association</h3>
<p>The Education News Agency reported that the issue of district divisions for the Shanghai Municipal Education Association has recently drawn much attention from all sectors. A reporter from the Education News Agency visited Director Xu Peihuang yesterday. The following is a record of Mr. Xu's remarks: According to Article 6 of the Education Association Law, the districts of the education association shall be based on the existing administrative districts. According to the municipal government's administrative districts, there are seventeen districts in total: Huna, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Yangjing, Yinhang, Wusong, Jiangwan, Pengpu, Zhenru, Pusong, Fahua, Caojing, Yangsi, Tangqiao, Lixing, Gaohang, and Gaoqiao, as well as the two concessions as a special district, making a total of eighteen districts. According to the law, each municipal education association should be established according to the above-mentioned district divisions. Earlier, the bureau received an order from the Ministry of Education urging the establishment of municipal education associations in all districts before March 15, and immediately notified everyone. However, in recent days, the Municipal Party Headquarters has repeatedly sent letters stating that this division is inconvenient for guiding the municipal education association and requesting alternative arrangements. After careful consideration by the bureau, it was believed that Article 6 of the Education Association Law stipulates that the districts of the district education association may be subject to exceptions if there are special circumstances and the approval of the supervisory authority is obtained. The bureau, as the legal supervisory authority, has the power to make changes. However, this matter is of great importance and should not be decided immediately. After consultation with Central Committee member Zhu Jiahua and members of the Municipal Party Headquarters on the evening of the 2nd, it was decided to change the districts of the Shanghai Municipal Education Association to eleven districts for the sake of facilitating the guidance of the Party Headquarters, and to use the districts divided by the Party Headquarters as the districts. Because it was late, it could not be announced. The bureau will issue a notice tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing Donates the West River to Great China University</h3>

<p>Yesterday evening, the match between Zhenru and Mailing in the fourth group of the Shanghai Basketball Association games caused the spectators to shout and cheer wildly, shaking the surroundings.

In Division B, Youai failed for the first time, Shangchu won 33 to 26, and Chuguang won 43 to 17 against Xinguang.

A certain player in the Xinguang team wore casual clothes on the court, which was in poor form and behaved barbarically, showing no attitude of an athlete. It is hoped that this will be corrected. In another group, Qingguang defeated Jianhua, with a score of 46 to 25. The situation of Division A is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Qingguang defeated Jianhua: Although Jianhua fought fiercely, they were ultimately defeated by Qingguang and failed to distinguish themselves. In the first half, Qingguang scored 24 points and Jianhua scored 10 points. As a result, Qingguang won 46 to 25. Referee: Jiang Xiangqing.</p>

<p>▲Zhenru defeated Mailing: The competition between the two teams was extremely fierce, which is rare in recent Shanghai Basketball Association games. Mailing took the lead with a momentum like splitting bamboo. Bie Xupu and Meng were particularly brave. Zhenru was completely overshadowed and at a loss, falling behind 2 to 15. Later, they struggled hard and showed some improvement. Mailing led 28 to 20 in the first half. In the renewed battle, Zhenru's momentum greatly improved, and Mailing also persisted unremittingly. After 33 to 24 (Mailing took the lead), Zhenru's momentum became more and more intense. The three generals Li, Wei, and Huang made contributions, and the score jumped to 35 to 32. Zhenru was only three points behind. In an instant, it became 37 to 36. At this time, the audience shouted loudly, all straining their voices. However, Zhenru failed to take the lead by that precious point. A slight oversight by the guards allowed Bie Xupu and Meng from Mailing to score again. Zhenru continued to work hard and tried to retaliate. Huang and Wei also scored two goals, and the score was still one point behind Mailing, with a score of 40 to 41. Wei Haiqing lurked under the basket and raised his hands. As a result, Zhenru suddenly came out of the blue and took the lead with 42 to 41. From then on, the momentum was strong and smooth, and they won 49 to 43. Huang Zhaolin's shooting was extremely accurate in this battle, scoring 27 points alone, making him a great hero.

<h3>Hongwei's Sentimental Recollections of Dunan</h3>
<p>— A Dan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Yazi, saying that our colleague Fu Dungen died of illness in Anqing. Another member of the Southern Society has passed away. The sadness upon hearing the news is indescribable. Dungen was from Liling, Hunan. His original name was Xiong Xiangxuan, later changed to Zhuan. He was skilled in poetry and classical prose. In his early years, he devoted himself to revolution and was friendly with Ning Taiyi, Chen Tuian, and others. He and the editor were responsible for compiling the "Dongting Bo Magazine." After the Pingxiang Uprising failed in the Bingding year, Ning was arrested. The Qing officials investigated him closely. He fled to the sea. In the Gui Chou year, Tang Xiangming supervised Hunan and conducted a major search for party members. Dungen's name was listed. So, he fled from Changsha to Liling, seeking refuge at people's homes, but no relatives or friends dared to take him in. He was in dire straits. A courtesan named Huang Yujiao, with a beautiful face and a generous nature, had the spirit of a chivalrous woman. Dungen, under the assumed name of Zhang Lu, followed the example of Du Mu seeking spring, accompanied by Gong Jiemi and Huang Xuyuan. He hid in Yujiao's house. Yujiao fell in love with him at first sight, but noticing his extreme destitution, she inquired about him and learned that he was a party member. She admired and loved him even more. She generously set up a quiet room for him to live in and provided everything for him. Yujiao took care of everything. Dungen was very grateful and vowed to repay her. After ten days, the investigators relaxed a bit, and he secretly fled. After the incident was resolved, he tried to find her, but she had moved with her entire family, and her whereabouts were unknown. When asked, some villagers said she had married, others said she had died. Reliable information was hard to come by. Dungen was depressed for months and wrote "Hongwei's Sentimental Recollections" to pass on her story. Many literary figures across the country composed poems for it. There are two accompanying illustrations, created by Huang Binhong and Cai Zhefu.</p>
<p>Dungen once taught in Wangxianzhen. The town was named after the immortal Prince Qiao. The characters of Yujiao's name, with the strokes removed, also fittingly become Wang Qiao. Thus, he realized that encounters in life have their own causes. "Hongwei's Sentimental Recollections" casually writes about kindness and resentment, hence the name "Hongwei Sheng." He also heard that there was a Wang Dungen in Shanghai, whose name was similar to his assumed name, so he wrote to Dungen to become literary friends. He then changed his name to Dunan or simply wrote Dungen.</p>
<p>In recent years, Dungen served as a secretary in the provincial government, a member of the provincial assembly, the magistrate of Yuanjiang County, and the director of the Zhongshan Library. Last year, Changsha suffered two robberies, and ten thousand volumes of books were turned to ashes. He fled to Hankou, covered in dust. His colleagues did not recognize him. He then recuperated at Xiaotianchi in Mount Lu. Before long, Jiujiang was in a state of emergency, so he fled to Anqing. His illness worsened. He kept it a secret and wrote calligraphy and poems for pleasure. On the eve of his death, he still wrote a couplet for Zou Qiushi, gathering lines from Ding An's poems: "Arrange to write a collection of three thousand volumes, plan to watch the mountains for fifty years."</p>
<p>Dungen once traveled to West Lake and visited Songzhuang, ascending Jing Su Pavilion. A gardener presented two lotus flowers and said with a smile to his companions, "I will come to this pavilion as a god one day. You two must come in time and not forget to offer flowers to me." The guest said, "If you become a god, please inform us in advance, and we two will come to accompany you." Dungen jokingly said, "It is almost what is called 'begging for a beautiful appearance and temples to sit with me, coming in another body as the Water Immortal King'."

<h3>Discovery of the Imperial Seal of the Former Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Ou Qiu</p>
<p>The imperial seal of the former Qing Dynasty was lost for a long time. Now it has suddenly been discovered in the hands of a Singaporean overseas Chinese named Chen Zhen. Is this not a strange tale? Examining its origins, it dates back to the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 (the 27th year of the Guangxu reign). The Eight-Nation Alliance attacked and broke through Beijing. Guangxu fled in haste, and in the rush, he did not have time to bring out the imperial seal. When the Allied forces entered the city, they carried out a large-scale search and looting. All ancient artifacts and rare treasures were taken. The imperial seal was acquired by an American sailor. At first, the sailor did not know what it was. Seeing that it was contained in a brocade box and attached with yellow silk, he knew it must be a treasure, so he hid it and took it home. Later, the sailor went to Manila to visit a friend, but he did not find him, and his funds were exhausted. He had no way to return home, so he had to pawn the imperial seal to the Chinese consulate to get money to return to his hometown. The consul thought of returning it to the royal family and carefully preserving it. Unexpectedly, he died suddenly due to illness. Recently, his family sent the seal to his relative Chen Zhen, asking him to sell it for a good price. Chen believed that the imperial seal was of great importance and could not bear to see it fall into the hands of foreigners and become a topic of gossip, so he decided to pay a huge price to properly preserve it. The seal is a five-inch square, made of jadeite jade. The green spots are bright and radiant. The handle is carved with two dragons. The engraved ancient seal script is unfortunately unidentifiable.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Antiquities Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xie Fei</p>
<p>The History and Archaeology Group of the National Central Research Institute conducted three excavations at the Yin Ruins site in Xiaotun Village, Henan, in 1928 and 1929. In 1930, they also excavated at Chengziya, Licheng, Shandong. The artifacts obtained have been successively repaired, classified, and arranged. The essence of them was selected for exhibition at the Natural History Museum on Chengxian Street in the capital from February 21st to 23rd. Lectures were also given publicly at the Zhongda University on the afternoons of the 21st and 23rd, with slides shown to make it easier for the audience to understand. As I was nearby, I had already heard about Mr. Li Ji's lecture, so I visited the next day to admire the antiquities.</p>
<p>▲ Ancient and Mottled The next day, Mr. Zhang Ruzhou and I received admission tickets from the general affairs office of the Central Research Institute and walked about two hundred steps north to reach the Natural History Museum. The museum usually displays a large number of bird and animal specimens. Now, two rooms upstairs are empty. Upon entering, the ticket collector gifted a copy of the "Overview of Archaeological Work and Catalog of Exhibits." Each person received one copy, which could be used to cross-reference with the exhibits. The intention was very good. We first entered the antiquities room, which was divided into two major categories: items unearthed from Xiaotun Village, Anyang, and items unearthed from Chengziya, Licheng. The former consisted of 428 items, and the latter consisted of 120 items, totaling 548 items. The Xiaotun items were from the Yin Ruins: turtle shells, animal bones, texts, stone tools, shell tools, pottery shards, bone tools, etc. The Chengziya items were single-color pottery, shell tools, and divination bones from the Stone Age in Shandong. The smaller items were all embedded in glass boxes according to their type, allowing people to observe the traces of their comparative evolution. A silver triangular stand was placed next to the boxes, with a descriptive note indicating the land location, item name, number of items, and age in detail. The larger pottery items were all glued together from their broken pieces to restore the beauty of their form. Although the number of items was not large, the arrangement was unique, allowing people to feel a sense of nostalgia for the past and the country among the scattered bones and stones. Many work photos were hung on the four walls, with scenes of frozen villages and earthen mounds, making people yearn for them.</p>
<p>▲ Clear and Vivid The east room was a display of Ming and Qing historical materials. The archives of the Ming and Qing dynasties had almost been scattered among the people, and later they were transferred to the Central Research Institute for sorting by the Institute of History. What is currently displayed is a portion of them. Imperial edicts and memorials are all carefully mounted and readable. The deeds of Zheng Chenggong, Mao Wenlong, and Yuan Chonghuan can be gleaned from them. The foundation of the tribute system and the memorials of vassalage can also be seen. After the Manchus succeeded the Ming Dynasty, they used the new dynasty to rule the world and suppressed and confused many facts of the former Ming Dynasty, calling them chaotic and disordered. What is desired is to organize their biographies from the piles of old paper and to guard what is missing and delve into what is confused. It is even more necessary to eagerly expect the gentlemen of the Institute to draw from this and enter deeply.</p>
<p>Truly, as Mr. Li Ji said, the excavation of antiquities serves two purposes: one is to determine the history of Chinese ancient Stone Age culture, and the other is to refute the European theory that the Han Chinese came from the West. Now, the excavation of antiquities is sufficient to support these two theories and to prove that ancient Chinese culture was not created by a single phenomenon but was the convergence of multiple forces, which continues to this day in a process of division and integration. The rise of learning is always based on the discovery of ancient artifacts and ancient books. Now there are more and more ancient artifacts, but fewer and fewer ancient books. In the past, the Fenyu fell and foreign words returned. Can one not sigh?</p>
<h3>Loujiang's Fond Memories</h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>My Tai is near the river and surrounded by water, residing in the lower reaches of the Lou River. The folk customs are simple and honest, and the government is simple and the laws are clear. It is known as a land of peace and happiness. Unexpectedly, in recent years, lake bandits and sea pirates have taken the opportunity to steal and commit crimes. Kidnappings have occurred one after another, and the villagers are uneasy. The local strength is empty, and there is no way to defend themselves. Although there are virtuous officials, there is no way to govern. Those who have left their posts one after another include Yuan Gong Xiluo and Tao Gong Mu, both of whom are excellent in learning and conduct and are outstanding figures of their time. Tao Gong was dismissed after only four months. Yuan Gong was in office for one year and four months, and then resigned with a request for the people because the area was not peaceful. The townspeople missed him even more. Yuan Gong was the younger brother of Mr. Guanlan and a senior revolutionary. He was humble and modest in nature, and the entire town praised him. He inspected each township every month to understand the people's hidden concerns and paid special attention to agriculture. He personally led the people in capturing locusts and treating rice borers, and he personally led his subordinates to guide the capture and eradication. He lectured to the villagers, repeating himself many times. When he went on patrol, he always wore a long blue cloth shirt and rode in a small car, with a very simple entourage. He had the style of a commoner county magistrate, and he was approachable and kind to people. He hated opium the most. He once personally arrested a smoker and put him in jail. He usually liked to chant poems and had many good ones. He was skilled in calligraphy, and he responded to all requests. On the day he left office, the viewers blocked the road, and they all sighed that the worthy magistrate could not stay long. The poems of farewell from the townspeople have many good records. Mr. Jin Yimou's poem says: "The dawn sun in the pupils of Zhao Bao Mountain, the beauty of the Shu River shows the brilliance of a strange scholar. Remember when you were chosen as a Buddha in the young age, competing to be on the dragon gate of the forehead. The chest is full of history, the brush is used to write Su and Huang characters. The flag turned the revolutionary stone city, hand holding the golden seal Mingtang servant. (The former Premier took office as temporary President, and he was the representative who awarded the seal.) The hate-filled demons have crooked noses. The round gallbladder alone supports the body, and the iron statue slays the traitors and casts the river bank. (Qi Xieyuan harmed the Su, Mr. Shou Chang proposed casting iron statues to be placed in various disaster areas) For thirty years, the heart and blood have been exhausted, and the plan has changed and the time has passed. The whistling chrysanthemum is fragrant in the evening, hoping to follow the example of the former sages and learn to be an official. Shiyuan is indeed not a hundred-mile talent, and the government urges the people and works diligently to comfort the people. Knowing that the green bamboo spring is burnt, there are many critics in the world today. Spring mother dreams of ashes, and fluttering away to return to the field. The owls roar wildly, and the phoenix is silent, the yin and yang are reversed, as if it is. Even if I am ashamed of not being Dantai, why should I interfere in public affairs. Just because the people cherish the virtuous magistrate, this intention is clear as autumn water. I sadly drink goodbye to Dongdu, and the distant fragrance of herbs sends love to the horizon. Let's look at the bamboo horse to welcome him in the coming years. The original bad 相斯 is even waiting to be restored." Yuan Gong's departure has made it clear that the annual political achievements are not there. To seek herdsmen for the people is to be trapped in the grass. Keeping the integrity of the group laughs foolishly, and the soldiers guarding the Kou have their own husbands. It is fortunate that the locusts are no longer seen, and the painful bridge is not yet fully laid. Hang your hat today and return to the past. "I can't compare with Yuanming's old house." All are historical records. Also, the Demon Buddha said, "The Demon Buddha stands side by side, and there is a Demon where there is a Buddha. If the Demon disappears, the Buddha will not be seen, and the world will be confused." A work with feelings. (Unpaid)</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (129)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Children in Bassein and Yangon all play the game of flying kites, often raising them on the roofs of houses to fly them. Although there is not much wind like in China, they can still fly into the clouds for several feet. I don't understand the reason. In China, I heard people say that once Qingming passes, the earth's energy no longer rises, and kites can no longer be flown. Therefore, people do it in the second month of the yin calendar. It is now the eighth or ninth month of the yin calendar here, so I don't understand why they can be flown. In Bassein, there is a small skill, which is making gas lamps that can be released into the air, which are very beautiful. The method is to use cotton paper to paste together a lamp that is five or six feet high in diameter. (Any size is fine, but larger ones are easier to lift). First, burn tung oil rope to fill it with smoke, which can be held by two people to prevent it from flying away. Once the smoke is full, light the tung oil rope at the base of the lamp and let it rise. The lamp will rise, and a string of small candle lamps can be attached below to make a tail. They come in all colors and are very beautiful in the sky. These lamps don't cost much and are easy to make. You can learn after watching it once. I often saw people flying them in Bassein. When I asked, they said they were made by the Fujianese. As the sun sets and the moon rises, they often float in the sky and are called Zhuge lamps. The Fujianese said that they are common in Fujian, but I have never seen them in Shanghai. It is possible that they are made by the Burmese, but I don't know. However, there is a danger, which is that if they fall on a thatched roof, they can easily cause a fire.</p>
<p>In Guangdong and Japan, I have seen the show of a beauty turning into a skeleton. It costs a dime each time to watch. The method is very simple, but very ingenious. You see a living beauty, and when a light shines on her, she suddenly gradually turns into a white skeleton, and then gradually returns to her original form and is still a beauty. I couldn't understand how it was done. People said it wasn't an X-ray mirror. When I was in Penang, Master Fakong was very talented and said he could do it, but unfortunately I didn't get to learn from him.</p>
<p>Some people use silver bowls to ask for money. I was surprised when I first saw it. A friend said, "We used to say that silver bowls were used to beg for food. This saying is now proven in Burma." The beggar holding a silver bowl is not a beggar, but a street leader of the neighborhood. I looked at the bowl, which was eight inches in diameter and four inches high, with glittering silver flowers. The bowl-holder stands respectfully in front of each business's door. Each business routinely contributes silver and copper coins, regardless of whether they are Burmese, Western, or Chinese. They all give alms respectfully and without stinginess. This is the method of regularly soliciting alms to support the monks.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Financial Gold Standard, Stable Attitude</p>
<p>▲ Trend Towards Peace Yesterday, March 3rd, the gold standard situation was relatively peaceful. The market turned from high to low in the morning, and then stabilized in the afternoon, eventually rising slightly. Throughout the day, it only fluctuated around seven taels. The intention of the industry was stable, but the trading situation was complex. Yuan Maoyong, Chunyuanyong, and joint hedging all bought in. Chengfengyong, Qianchangxiangyuantai, etc., all occupied the selling side. Probably because the foreign exchange was slightly stable, the listed prices were as before, and the overseas silver market reported lower, so the price opened higher. Afterwards, sellers were eager, and bills of exchange were tight, so they were flat, so the trend was small. From seven hundred and seventy-six or seven taels, it was reduced to about seventy taels. In the afternoon, buyers seemed strong. Chengfengyongfu chang and other chased in. Yifengyongzhifengyong and others sold out, and the price turned slightly moderate, increasing by two or three taels.

<p>▲ Extremely Quiet in the Afternoon The afternoon opening was seventy-two taels. Afterwards, there seemed to be more sellers, because the Indian exchange rate increased by one anna, and it immediately dropped to seventy taels and seven mace. Then Chengfengyongyuanmaoyong and others bought in. Probably because the exchange market was still stable, it was raised by three taels again. To two and a half o'clock in the afternoon, it was seventy-three taels and seven or eight mace. Items and other sold, and it fell back to seventy-two taels. In an instant, Yuanheng and others bought in, and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had dropped by three or four annas again. To three o'clock, it was seventy-three taels and six mace. Later, the selling of positions was unremitting, and it was seventy-two taels again. At four thirty, it was calculated at seventy-three taels one or two mace to two taels five or six mace. The market was very flat. Until four thirty, the closing was seventy-two taels and nine mace, an increase of two taels and seven mace compared to the day before yesterday. It was done again to seventy-three taels.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Slightly Shows Hidden Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets in Britain, the United States, India, etc., all reported lower. The market situation was flat.

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Markets Continue to be Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak, but the trend is softening due to dull actual sales and increased inventory. This has dampened sentiment, and outside investors are gradually adopting a shorting strategy to meet their needs, selling when prices rise. There are also rumors circulating in the market, but a major manufacturer is still holding firm, buying on dips. The price increase of Dongyang's three types of yarn remains strong. Currently, due to weak sales of actual yarn, the market is weak, but large trading houses have not yet released a significant amount of their quota.</p>
<p>▲ Human Standard Reduced, Foreign Standard Increased. The opening of the previous session of the human standard market saw American cotton flat and weak, while Indian cotton rose. All months rose by 4-5 qian. The second and third sessions were flat due to the difficulty of moving actual yarn, and sentiment was scattered. The market fell, with all days falling by 7-9 qian to 1-2 liang. In the afternoon, rumors led to a sharp decline in the second and third sessions, with all months breaking the 70 liang barrier. Closing prices were pulled back by holding manufacturers, resulting in a decline of 3-5-7 qian. Total volume traded was 22,550 bales. Changfeng sold 2,700 bales, Gengfeng 650 bales, and Rongxing 600 bales. Meiji bought 1,200 bales, Tongxing 850 bales, and Xincheng 850 bales. The closing prices of the human standard are recorded below.</p>

<p>August: 17.52, Down 13, 3550</p>
<p>▲ Actual Yarn Sales Continue to be Cleared: Actual yarn sales are quite clear. Total purchases by various groups for the day were 320 bales, including 205 bales from within the trade, 250 bales from Sichuan, 30 bales from inland areas, 5 bales from Shantou, 5 bales from Xiamen, 15 bales from Nanjing, 10 bales from Tianjin, and 5 bales from Wuhu.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of softening because actual demand is stagnant after the price increase, and cotton yarn sales are increasingly sluggish, leading to a lack of enthusiasm among factories. The trend of foreign cotton is also one of hesitation, so Japanese merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, bullish sentiment among cotton traders remains high, and they still have thoughts of cornering the market, buying on dips and refusing to relax. The future remains unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Continues to Decline: The opening of the previous session of the Han standard market saw Indian cotton rise again, causing the market to tighten slightly, with all contracts rising by 2 qian. The second and third sessions were weak due to falling yarn prices, falling by 1 qian. The decline was severe in the second and third sessions in the afternoon, but prices rose again as bulls bought, resulting in a decline of 1.5-2.5 qian. Total volume traded was 48,800 dan. Jifeng sold 1,300 dan, Gongtai 3,000 dan, Gengfeng 4,000 dan, Changfeng 5,600 dan, and Yuanda 3,900 dan. Rongxing bought 4,000 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Changfeng 1,900 dan, and Xincheng 5,300 dan.

<p>Nanshi Hua: 42.25</p>
<p>Yongyu Factory Received 200 Bales of Spot Goods Delivered to the Factory</p>
<h3>American Cotton is Weak, Three Products are Outstanding</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Bulls Liquidated: Yesterday, American cotton was firm initially due to good news from Liverpool, but weakened due to weakness on Wall Street and the need for many to liquidate, with futures falling by 3-7 points. Spot prices were unchanged. English cotton futures rose by 9-10 points, and spot prices rose by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 30 points. The Indian cotton market was firm and stable, with Pingguoer and Bairuoxi rising by 6 rupees each for both near and far months, Aomula rose by 4 rupees for the near term and 5 rupees for the far term. The original telegram is recorded below (2nd telegram).</p>

<h3>British and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay's market prices fluctuated greatly last week. At the beginning of the week, speculators bought and shorts covered extensively. Later, rumors of new tariffs on Indian cotton and cloth exports and tariffs on foreign cotton imports caused a sudden reversal. In the spot market, local factories were cautious buyers, and shippers transported a lot of Oomra cotton. Demand for White Raw Cotton was sluggish, and holders were eager to sell. There were high hopes for China, but transactions depended on the silver price. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<p>1930, 1931</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts since September 1st: 2,165, 2,003</p>
<p>Inventory at the End of the Week: 1,300, 954</p>
<p>Accumulated Exports since September 1st: 1,204, 1,276</p>
<p>Shipments to Europe: 4,83, 12</p>
<p>Shipments to China: 139, 177</p>
<p>Shipments to Japan: 615, 778</p>
<p>Shipments to Other Regions: 33, 9</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool's spot sales were more active last week. Futures buying was strong initially due to purchases by merchants from Bombay and continental Europe. Now, due to Alexandria's reaction, buyers have become hesitant. Egyptian cotton also experienced a sharp decline after the price increase.</p>
<h3>Food: Rainy Weather, Rice Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>▲ Due to the blocked waterway in Zhabei yesterday, source transfer was available, but sales were quiet due to the heavy rain. It was difficult to unload cargo from along the river, and there were even fewer shopkeepers going to the market to inspect goods. Therefore, both japonica rice and Yangxian rice and Bay Rice traded a little, and river cargo was very scarce. The overall market was stable.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, goods continued to arrive in South Shanghai. Sales on the street were limited to minor transactions to the north, and prices remained stable. Thin rice and Yangxian rice cargo owners intended to raise prices due to the rainy weather, so no transactions were made. Prices were stable. The altered dollar was scarce and relatively firm due to yin-like weather, but the market was extremely quiet.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Finally Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a mostly stable market in the morning session. Although Yang wheat quotations were still slightly different by two, three, or four jiao, the public was quite stable due to the rainy weather, with very slight changes compared to the previous day's closing. When the afternoon session opened, the situation did not improve due to multiple long positions from outside the industry, and all months saw a pullback. Major manufacturers, with surplus Yang wheat on order, still disregarded everything and frequently engaged in frantic selling. As a result, both near and far periods fell sharply. Given the expanded amount of selling by manufacturers, and if actual sales cannot follow, optimism is not warranted. As a result, the current month was down 2.75 cents from the previous day, April was down 2.25 cents, May was down 2.5 cents, and June to August were all down 2.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Presents Soft State</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw all months stable after the morning session opened. Price changes were very slight, and transactions were not very active. When the afternoon session opened, Yang wheat quotations were ultimately lower, and traders had a continued tendency to order Yang wheat. At the unified price of Australian wheat from the previous day, it was sufficient to sell off, so a portion of sentiment suddenly appeared weak. Observing the trend in the market, before the selling of Yang wheat ends, the positions of both sides seem to favor shorts. As a result, the current month was down 4 cents from the previous day, April was down 6 cents, May was down 5 cents, June was down 5 cents, July was down 6 cents, and August was down 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Standard Bean Cakes are Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bean cake market was quite active, with buyers showing a strong interest in both the morning and afternoon sessions. However, Dalian merchants and some trading houses sold slightly, so near and far-term prices showed a firm and stable trend. News from Dalian was good at noon, and market sentiment improved. As a result, March, May, and July remained unchanged, while April, June, and July were all up by a large half cent.</p>
<h3>Northern Goods: Walnut Meat Prices Remain High in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Walnut meat arrivals have been normal with average sales. Shanghai market prices have fallen compared to last winter, and Hankou prices are only around 36-37 liang. However, according to a telegram from Tianjin yesterday, prices for top-grade walnut meat remained extremely high, reaching 120 yuan, and even the better light-colored Tiger walnut meat required 90 yuan. The disparity between Tianjin and Shanghai market prices is evident.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea: Lüzhuang Zhenmei Tea Sales to the UK Continue Briskly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in the foreign concessions saw Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, and British trading houses such as Xiehe, Jinlong, Baochang, and Fushi all showed interest. Transactions were quite active, and market sentiment turned firmer. Bai Tou Trading also had some scattered interest in needle-shaped, silk-like, and thread-like green tea, with sales prices unchanged from before. The Qi Hong black tea, although with an inventory of 1,000-2,000 boxes, remains stagnant.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Wool Fabrics, and N绒 sell well in this street</h3>
<p>Wool fabrics and down, recently, the various businesses on this street have been in great need, and the trend in the chamber of commerce is extraordinarily lively. Most are stamped single credit account business, and cash transactions are very rare. Most of those who deliver goods to foreign companies are old goods. Biji and plain Walter呢 saw slight reversals, while mixed checkered Walter呢, single white opening beauty cloth, and yuanqing straight tribute 呢, etc. The market atmosphere recovered and became firm, and the sales plate was even more outstanding than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Softens Due to Slow Sales</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions once flourished during the beginning of the Lunar New Year (i.e., the so-called "yuanbao business") in areas such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, the Yangtze River, and inland regions such as Fujian. The total amount of various goods opened in the city reached more than 10,000 dan, including large quantities of old iron products and large hardware. In the past four or five days, customers have reported that they are full, with little demand, and factory trimming has also been less than before. Moreover, the continuous rainy weather has made transactions even weaker, and the overall situation in the city has softened accordingly, with commodity prices also showing signs of loosening. Fortunately, there have been no major changes in the exchange rate, so the standards for several popular products have been maintained without falling. Yesterday, French nails were quoted at 9 liang, 4 qian, and 5 fen, with over 300 barrels transacted. Tinplate factories received over 1,000 boxes, with prices for English goods at 16 liang for 90 pounds and 17 liang for 100 pounds. American goods were priced at 18 liang for 90 pounds and 19 liang for 100 pounds. Large tinplate was priced at 33 liang, and thin iron was priced at 50 liang. The price of crude green lead was 17 liang, 4 qian, with 200 dan transacted, purchased by paint companies. Foreign goods sold for 18 liang, 5 qian, with few transactions. Foreign yuan, foreign boards, and pointed iron were also opened, but prices showed little change.</p>

<h3>City Finance Bureau Director Reports on Financial Situation</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday Evening's Reception for Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>▲ Announcement of Business Tax Rate Awaits</p>
<p>▲ This Year's Budget May Increase by One Million</p>
<p>City Finance Bureau Director Tang Naikang held a banquet at the Public Servants' Club at 43 Weihaiwei Road yesterday evening at 7:00 PM to entertain newspaper reporters and report on the general situation of the Finance Bureau's business. More than ten representatives from newspapers such as Shen Bao, Min Guo Ri Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Shi Bao, and Shi Shi Xin Bao attended. During the banquet, Mr. Tang rose to give a speech, saying, approximately, "Thank you all for not disdaining and gracing us with your presence. I am deeply honored. I have been in office for eight months now, and I would like to report to you on my experiences over the past half-year."</p>
<p>▲ Revenue and Expenditure Situation: The budgeted income for the 19th year was 6.5 million yuan, and the budgeted expenditure was 7,024,183 yuan. This included 500,000 yuan for repaying old debts, over 820,000 yuan for public welfare subsidies, 200,000 yuan for temporary expenses, and over 320,000 yuan for reserve funds allocated according to the trial budget regulations. The amount used to cover the regular needs of various agencies was 5.2 million yuan. Breaking this down by percentage, the municipal government accounted for 5.1%, the Finance Bureau 6.8%, the Public Security Bureau 27.2%, the Education Bureau 20.5%, the Land Bureau 5.3%, the Social Affairs Bureau 4.1%, the Public Works Bureau 17.0%, the Public Utilities Bureau 5.0%, the Health Bureau 4.7%, the Port Authority 2.2%, the urban area 1.1%, and various committees 1.0%. Compared to the previous year's budget, the Public Works and Education Bureaus saw the largest increases, while other bureaus experienced slight increases. The overall revenue and expenditure showed a shortfall of more than 500,000 yuan. Potential sources of revenue to offset this shortfall include the Jiangsu Provincial Government's outstanding allocation for police salaries, which, after deducting subsidies for the Shangbao counties, still leaves a balance of tens of thousands of yuan. Additionally, the recovery of wharf taxes and the abolition of the 2.5% South City property tax could generate tens of thousands of yuan in additional revenue annually. However, all of the above are draft budgets for the 19th year and have not yet been approved and implemented. Therefore, all expenditures, except for those that are necessary and have been specifically approved, follow the previous year's budget. However, a comprehensive calculation shows that the monthly expenses required are not much different from the new budget. Speaking specifically of the income and expenditure situation in the first half of the year, the net income was more than 2.89 million yuan, and the net expenditure was more than 3.42 million yuan. (This included approximately 80,000 yuan in regular expenses for the Fire Brigade, Security Corps, and Local Self-Government Training Institute, which were not included in the original budget, as well as over 600,000 yuan in various temporary expenses that were approved later.) The revenue and expenditure already showed a deficit of more than 520,000 yuan. In addition, various transactions, such as the recovery of the South City wharf, used the guarantee deposits paid by shipping companies to offset the shortfall, and the municipal treasury allocated more than 100,000 yuan, which was not included. Approximately 600,000 yuan is still owed for emergency expenses. Furthermore, the province's outstanding payments have not yet been allocated, and the recovery of wharf taxes and the abolition of the 2.5% South City property tax in the first half of the year have not been realized. Therefore, the financial situation is deeply difficult. This is the general situation. As for this year's budget, it may increase to approximately 7.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Organization of Finance Council: When I first took office, I realized that the Finance Bureau lacked a consultative body, which often led to misunderstandings regarding local opinions. Therefore, in September of last year, I submitted a proposal to the Municipal Government to establish a Finance Advisory Committee. Local financial and economic experts, as well as those with financial experience, were invited to serve as committee members. Regular meetings are held monthly, and any important administrative matters of the Bureau that are deemed necessary for discussion are submitted to the committee for review. Committee members can also raise opinions on financial measures at any time for discussion. By pooling wisdom and working together, progress can be made. The establishment of this committee is truly a way to make finances more transparent, and both the government and the people benefit from it. The committee members are concerned about municipal affairs and are enthusiastic about their work, which is something we deeply appreciate. In addition, the Bureau's publications have only included one type: business reports. Each year, one is published, containing the policy situation and revenue and expenditure statistics for that year, which are all past events. The publication period is too long, and citizens concerned about finances often find it difficult to understand the actual financial situation at the time. Since I took office, I have strongly advocated for financial transparency, believing that the Bureau's publications must be expanded to meet the expectations of citizens. Therefore, I have created the Shanghai Finance Quarterly. In addition to regularly publishing the city treasury's revenue and expenditure situation and financial progress, it also broadly solicits papers from domestic financial and economic experts and translates European and American financial works for research and reference. The first issue of the publication has already been printed and distributed to various sectors, and the second issue will also be published soon and sent to you for correction.</p>
<p>▲ Rectification of Tax Revenue: Since the Bureau abolished the contractor system for ship taxes on November 1, 1929, and took over self-management, the monthly revenue of various ship tax offices has increased. However, the process of collecting missed and supplementary taxes on ships has been extremely complex. Therefore, the ship tax regulations have been carefully revised. On the one hand, strict investigation is used to prevent evasion, and on the other hand, supplementary taxes are reduced to show consideration. Since the announcement of the revised regulations on December 1 of last year, operations have been more convenient, and shipowners have been relieved of some difficulties. In addition, Wusong sand fishing vessels, which have always been levied secondary taxes at reduced rates based on their class, have now been approved to be uniformly changed to monthly taxes, in order to avoid disputes and ensure fairness. Furthermore, the property tax in this city was reorganized in the winter of 1927, abolishing the name of general tax and uniformly changing to property tax. The tax rate was set at 10% for residential households and 14% for shops, and all districts followed it. However, in the winter of 1926, the South City, due to the aftermath of the war, the local vitality had not yet recovered, the district gentry approved to temporarily collect taxes at 75% of the fixed rate, so they still follow the old method. However, this is a temporary expedient measure, and there is no reason to remain unchanged. Therefore, it has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, starting this spring, the 75% discount will be canceled to comply with the tax regulations, and return to uniformity. It is estimated that annual revenue can be increased by more than 300,000 yuan. In addition, the wharf tax was collected by the Shanghai Customs, with an annual income of approximately 800,000 taels. Among them, the merchant ship tax from the South City and Pudong wharves is about 400,000 taels, but in fact, the Jianghai Customs only allocates 10,000 yuan to the Municipal Government each year. Last year, the Municipal Government negotiated with the concession authorities, arguing that the distribution of wharf taxes was unfair, and agreed to change the collection of the Pudong and South City areas to the Municipal Government based on the location and area of cargo handling. This case has now been finalized, and it is estimated that annual revenue will increase by more than 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Planning Business Tax: The business tax is a source of municipal revenue according to the Municipal Organization Law. This city prepared for the business tax before the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but due to the complexity of the situation, it did not hesitate to extensively consult opinions and study in detail, so the announcement was later. The proposed plan for the city's central area cannot be easily implemented without actual financial resources, and the business tax is one way to promote the success of construction projects. However, this city is determined to adopt several principles in collecting business tax: (1) do not disturb the people, (2) adopt the opinions of local people, and (3) the tax rate should be the rate recognized by the central government, not higher than those of various provinces. Currently, the collection regulations and travel plan draft have been drafted, and the tax rate layer is particularly complicated, so we must be careful in doing things. We are now studying it in detail and it will be announced soon.</p>
<p>▲ Raising Municipal Bonds: This city issued 3 million yuan of municipal bonds in 1929, originally intended for 1.2 million yuan for the first phase of the construction of the city's main roads, 500,000 yuan for part of the construction of the city's central area, 210,000 yuan for the reorganization of old bonds, and 1 million yuan for opening a municipal bank. At that time, the Municipal Bond Solicitation Committee was established and divided into solicitation. The collected funds, estimated at 1 million yuan, were first allocated to the municipal bank fund, so the municipal bank opened in February of the 19th year. The old bonds of the former municipal agencies were prepared for reorganization and submitted to the municipal government for approval, and then posted in the newspaper to announce the exchange of municipal bond tickets by the municipal bank to comfort the citizens' eagerness. Later, due to military influence, the bond solicitation was only one-third. Until October of last year, the Municipal Bond Solicitation Committee drafted three measures and submitted them to the Construction Discussion Committee for resolution: (1) Collect payments separately from households that have recognized but not paid, (2) Borrow and collect rent to exchange for municipal bonds, which is to use the balance of the previously determined total amount of two months' rent collection after deducting 1 million yuan for short-term treasury bills for the 19th year's customs duties, and (3) All industries in this city will be apportioned at the same time. After submitting it to the Municipal Government for announcement and implementation, the borrowing and collection of rent has now come to an end. It is estimated that 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan of municipal bonds will be sold, which will be used exclusively for prescribed projects, so that construction can be completed early.</p>
<p>▲ Recovering the South Wharf: The South City coastline wharf and the along-Pu public land are interrelated and urgently need to be reorganized. The former Port Authority was ordered to organize an evaluation committee to evaluate the prices of the wharves owned by Dada, Datong, and Minxing companies, as well as their attached buildings, and recover them for municipal operation. It was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and the former Port Authority was convened to take over the wharves of the companies separately. On the one hand, the value of the wharf assets to be paid to the companies, as well as subsidies and repayment of loans, totaled more than 780,000 yuan, which were raised clearly. After the wharf is recovered, the annual income from rent and berthing fees, etc., is estimated to be more than 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Municipal Treasury: This city's finances, in terms of disbursement, have been handled by the fourth section of the Municipal Government Finance Bureau. Now, in order to separate accounting and disbursement, a municipal treasury is being established. It is expected to be officially established around July of this year, with a treasurer responsible for handling its affairs. Regarding the payment of funds, it is carried out under the order of the Finance Bureau.</h3>

<h3>Silk Factories Request Postponement of Silk Public Bonds</h3>
<p>▲ Meeting Held to Elect Representatives to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>Due to the slump in the European sales of factory silk, the silk factory industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai is in a precarious state. It has been agreed to request the government to issue Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai factory silk industry public bonds. The principal and interest shall be repaid within seven and a half years from the date of issuance, by collecting a special tax of 22.5 yuan per picul of yellow and white silk exported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. This has been previously reported. It is now learned that the Special Committee for the Relief of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Factory Industry specially convened a temporary emergency discussion meeting of the three-district committee members at the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association yesterday (3rd) afternoon at 3:00 PM. All the committee members from Shanghai, including Huang Jin Chen and Zhu Jing An, and the two committee members from Zhejiang, Jiang Lan Xian and Chu Hui Seng, (the Wuxi committee members were absent), more than 20 people, were in attendance. Shen Hua Chen presided over the meeting, performed the rituals, and first had the chairman read the original text of the silk industry public bond regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan, (the original text has been published in the previous newspaper of March 1st, omitted here). After discussion by the public, because the regulations revised by the Legislative Yuan are of little benefit and have a large burden, and because the competition of Japanese silk is relentless, the European sales of Chinese silk are declining, and silk merchants are unable to support it, it is really difficult to shoulder this heavy responsibility. It was decided that in addition to submitting a request to the National Government Executive Yuan to temporarily postpone the announcement of the case, representatives will be sent to Beijing to explain the current critical situation of the silk industry. In addition, it was decided to hold a three-district industry conference in Shanghai on the 5th of this month to publicly decide on the course of action. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The telegram to the National Government and the original letter to the Wuxi Industry Association are recorded below: (1) Telegram to the National Government Executive Yuan, Nanjing National Government and Executive Yuan Junjian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai factory silk industry, last year due to the tragic fall in silk prices, was unable to maintain, and closed down one after another. It has been requested to issue 10 million yuan in relief silk industry public bonds. Now reading the newspaper report on the Legislative Yuan's resolution of the public bond regulations, it is very different from the original request, the silk industry receives very little maintenance, and the burden of amortizing the public bond fund is very large, all silk merchants are greatly frightened, and urgently request Junfu to postpone the announcement temporarily, and separately send representatives to Beijing to present the matter in person, Shanghai Zhejiang Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Association Kou, (2) Letter to the Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Association, Respectfully, regarding the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk industry public bonds, reading the newspaper to know that the Legislative Yuan has passed the case, which is very different from the original request. Today, Shanghai convened an emergency meeting of representatives to discuss the results, and decided to first telegraph the National Government to postpone the announcement temporarily (the draft telegraph is attached for your review) and immediately send representatives to Beijing to petition, and scheduled to hold a Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai industry conference at the Shanghai Industry Association at 3:00 PM on the 5th of this month, to decide on the method, and especially sent a letter to Da, hoping that on the day the letter arrives, a meeting will be held to discuss and send a number of authorized representatives, please come to Shen before 3:00 PM on the 5th of this month, to attend the three-district industry conference and jointly vote, the matter is related to the overall situation of the silk industry, and the time is urgent, please do not delay, this to the Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Association Committee, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Relief Special Committee,</p>

<p>Guo Wen She reports that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China previously received a letter from the Longtan Town Chamber of Commerce in Jiangsu, stating that the transportation surtax for railway reorganization still exists, which is a stain on the major policies. At this time of full renewal, it should be forwarded to the Ministry of Railways to abolish this abnormal likin tax, to lighten the extra burden on the people, and other circumstances. The association, based on the situation, telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to abolish it. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received, saying, National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Jian, Zhao telegram is fully known, After checking, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to collect the transportation surtax for reorganization, which was originally a temporary measure for relief.

According to the previous situation in the telegram, a special reply is made for verification, Ministry of Railways Jian Yin,</p>
<h3>Directorate General of Customs Issues Order to All Customs Offices to Cease Collection of Yarn and Cloth Tax</h3>

<p>▲ Previously Overcharged Verified Unified Tax Certificates Can Be Returned</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the unified tax on February 1, yarn and cloth merchants in this city have ceased transporting goods in protest because customs offices were imposing tariffs on exported yarn and cloth.

<h3>Chiang Ti-hsien's Discussion on Cotton Production</h3>
<p>▲ Attention from the Cotton Industry</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Production Improvement and Statistics Conference, initiated by the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners' Association and the provincial cotton fields of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces, the provincial agricultural fields of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, the Hubei Cotton Industry Improvement Committee, the Agricultural Extension Department of Henan University, and the Zhengding Cotton Field of the Ministry of Industry, has been actively preparing and is scheduled to open at 2:00 PM on March 15th. Reporters from various newspapers inquired about the purpose of the conference to Mr. Chiang Ti-hsien, who is in charge of the conference preparation. He briefly stated that since the end of the European War, the domestic cotton textile industry has developed rapidly. In the past decade, the number of spindles has increased from two million to four million. Each spindle uses 200 catties of cotton per year, requiring a total of 8 million piculs. According to recent surveys by the Cotton Mill Owners' Association, the national cotton production in recent years has averaged no more than 7 million piculs, which is already insufficient to meet demand. This does not even include the cotton needed for clothing and bedding. Living standards in the interior are relatively low, and cotton consumption for clothing and bedding is at its highest, also accounting for 2 to 3 million piculs nationwide. Domestic supply is insufficient, making it necessary to import from foreign countries. As a result, imports of American and Indian cotton have increased significantly. Recent imports of foreign cotton totaled 2.41 million piculs in the sixteenth year, 1.91 million piculs in the seventeenth year, 2.51 million piculs in the eighteenth year, and 2.71 million piculs in the nineteenth year. Cotton exports, on the other hand, decreased from 1.44 million piculs in the sixteenth year to 230,000 piculs in the nineteenth year. The value of cotton imports in the nineteenth year exceeded 100 million taels, already ranking third among imported goods. The largest drain on our country's trade has always been the 200 million taels for cotton goods. Now, cotton alone exceeds 100 million taels, which is probably unknown to most people. In recent years, American and Indian cotton prices have been low, making purchases not very difficult. However, can it be guaranteed that prices will remain low? Therefore, the suffering felt by the textile industry regarding raw materials and the cotton drain will undoubtedly increase with time. Furthermore, with social progress, cotton products are becoming increasingly refined. Domestic cotton has short and coarse fibers, making it unsuitable for fine spinning, leading to a significant increase in American cotton imports. Therefore, improving and promoting our country's cotton production is a matter of utmost urgency. Our country has vast regions suitable for cotton cultivation. Jiangsu is known for its small land area and dense population, but according to reliable surveys, there are still over 20 million mu of land that can be reclaimed for cotton planting. The situation in other provinces is likely similar. If we can work hard to promote this, we can not only achieve self-sufficiency but also meet the needs of other countries. It would not be difficult to seize the authority over world cotton production currently held by the United States. Recently, the British economic mission came to China and repeatedly inquired about the state of China's cotton production, especially paying attention to the achievements in improvement. We felt unable to answer. Currently, most cotton-producing provinces in the country have established provincial cotton fields to oversee cotton production improvement work throughout the province. However, they operate independently and lack coordination. The primary purpose of this conference is to connect the organizations in various provinces that are practically engaged in cotton planting, so that they can exchange reports and recognize each other regarding the national cotton production situation, and jointly discuss comprehensive methods for improving and promoting cotton production nationwide. Secondly, the four countries with the highest cotton production in the world are the United States, India, China, and Egypt. Except for our country, governments in these countries have specially established bureaus for cotton production, spending vast sums of money on statistics. In our country, the Cotton Mill Owners' Association has been responsible for this work since 1919, but its efforts have been insufficient. Therefore, there has been little progress in the past twelve years. In recent years, with the support of cotton industry organizations in various provinces, we have been striving to improve the methods, but the conditions in each province are different. It is necessary to agree on methods suitable for the entire country, and revising the estimations is especially urgent. Accurate predictions of cotton harvests allow the domestic and foreign cotton industries to be aware of the supply situation early and adjust accordingly. For example, the recent sharp rise in cotton prices on the exchange, which led to a market shutdown, was largely due to the fact that most people were unaware of the poor harvest of Chinese cotton last year and sold excessively. In the future, as the domestic cotton industry develops further, these estimates will become increasingly important, so that we can eliminate the danger of significant gaps between supply and demand occurring without early remedial action. Furthermore, investigation and improvement are closely related. We must first understand the cotton production situation in various places before we can talk about improvement. We must first understand the progress and decline of cotton production in a certain place before we know the urgency of promotion. In recent years, Japanese cotton merchants in China have been sending personnel to cotton-producing areas during the cotton harvesting season to conduct investigations and publish forecast reports. The cotton industry treasures these reports like precious jade. Chinese cotton production, Chinese people cannot conduct their own investigations, and rely solely on the Japanese. This is truly regrettable. Therefore, this conference brings together cotton fields from various provinces to jointly discuss national cotton production estimation plans, divide the work, and cooperate to achieve effective results. There have been many conferences in the country in recent years, but few have been as narrowly focused as cotton production improvement and cotton production statistics. In fact, basic construction should start with simple tasks. This conference focuses on discussion, and motions must be approved by all representatives from the provinces before they are passed, so that they can be implemented. Recently, some conferences have resolved hundreds of motions in a single day, but we dare not hope for such results. If we can only complete one motion in seven days and the representatives bring it back to implement it, that is what we desire. Furthermore, since this news was announced, many have written to request to join. Invitation cards have already been distributed to the domestic cotton industry, but omissions are inevitable. The purpose of the conference is to improve Chinese cotton production and conduct estimations, relying on the joint efforts of the entire country. We sincerely welcome all sectors to participate and discuss everything, regardless of whether they initiated the conference or not.</p>
<h3>News of the National Assembly Elections</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Election Office for National Assembly representatives has been fully operational since its establishment the day before yesterday morning. On that same day, an organizational affairs meeting was held to coordinate everything.

<h3>Latvia Requests to Establish a Consulate in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A few days ago, Latvia sent Mr. Lusens to China to serve as the consul in Shanghai. He visited the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai to request that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs grant recognition. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied via telegram that since Latvia had no treaty relations with our country, it seemed inappropriate to grant recognition, but they would offer hospitality. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office immediately notified Mr. Lusens. Yesterday morning, Mr. Lusens again visited Director Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office to request that he inquire with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the possibility of recognizing Latvia's establishment of a consulate in Shanghai.</p>

It is a pity that there is not much time and I cannot speak freely. I would like to contribute the two most important points in managing local autonomy to you, hoping that you will strive for them: (1) Personnel managing local autonomy must not only remove local tyrants but also cooperate with the new, old, young, and old in the locality; (2) After receiving training, you must serve the society and relieve the suffering of the people. You must not be arrogant or conceited." Chu returned to Beijing on the night train last night.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Convene to Discuss the Implementation Rules of the Trade Association Law</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Government to Stop Trade Union Activities</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Government to Re-amend the Trade Association Law</p>
<p>The various trade associations in this city convened a meeting of representatives from various industries yesterday afternoon in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss various issues after the revision of the implementation rules of the Trade Association Law. Representatives from over eighty groups, including the Flour Industry, Cigarette Industry, Knitting Industry, New Medicine Industry, Seafood and Grocery Industry, Brick and Tile Industry, Pollen Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Sausage Industry, North and South Goods Industry, and Tea and Food Industry, as well as Chu Wen-chi, Sun Ching-tien, Shen Wei-ting, Cheng Hai-jo, Shao Pao-hsing, Chen Tzu-hsiang, Cheng Cheng-ching, Yeh Chia-hsing, and Sun Chou-cheng, a total of over one hundred people, elected Deng Cheng-qing as chairman and Xue Guang-qian as recorder. After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Deng Cheng-qing reported that the main purpose of convening the meeting was to discuss various issues after the central government abolished trade unions and revised the implementation rules of the Trade Association Law. This issue not only concerns the status of the various trade associations themselves but also has a significant impact on the inherent social system and economic organization. At the Third National Congress in 1929, in order to ensure that the mass movement met the needs of the tutelage period, separate principles were established and a plan for organizing people's organizations was formulated, dividing people's organizations into professional organizations and social organizations, with the exception of local self-government organizations that were regulated otherwise. The former included trade unions, farmers' associations, chambers of commerce, trade associations, etc., and the latter included student, women's, cultural, and religious groups. Each type of organization has its own specific laws and regulations. Trade unions have the Trade Union Law, chambers of commerce have the Chamber of Commerce Law, and trade associations have the Trade Association Law. Store clerk trade unions are not included in professional organizations, thus losing their legal footing and being virtually eliminated because the central government believes that store clerks are auxiliary to the main commercial entity and engage in commerce as commercial employees under commercial law. Their nature is the same as that of store owners, so there is no need to organize separately, which would create a confrontational situation with trade associations. Past facts have made this clear. Although the organization of trade unions has been nominally abolished, there is still the opportunity to participate in organizations. Article 10 of the implementation rules of the Trade Association Law stipulates that "each company or firm may send one to two member representatives as managers or main persons in charge. However, if the average number of store clerks in the most recent year is more than fifteen, one additional representative may be sent, elected by the store clerks of the respective company or firm." Therefore, store clerks also have the opportunity to participate in trade associations. However, the central government has recently made major revisions to this clause. The main points are as follows: (1) The number of store clerks required to send an additional representative has been reduced from fifteen to ten or more; (2) Store clerks may send up to three additional representatives, while store owners may only send one or two representatives; (3) The phrase "may" has been changed to "shall" in the legal text. "May" is an arbitrary provision, while "shall" has a mandatory nature. Considering the above three points, the organization of trade associations will be fundamentally shaken because the commerce in this city is relatively prosperous, and the number of employees used is generally not small. The number of stores with thirty or forty or more store clerks is numerous. According to the revised provisions, store clerks can send three representatives, but store owners can send a maximum of two representatives. Is such an association, organized with such a composition (three to two), still a trade association of the same trade, or will it become a trade association of store clerks? This is a very big question because store owners are busy planning and managing their businesses and are busy all day long. It is undeniable that they lack training and attention to groups. Therefore, the center of gravity of the association will inevitably be tied to the store clerks. It is obvious whether such an association will seek benefits for store owners or focus solely on the interests of store clerks. Judging from this situation, those who have not previously organized will not want to or dare to organize again. Those who have already organized would rather dissolve because allowing them to exist is like "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet," providing an additional layer of protection and exploitation for store clerks. Looking at the future of trade associations in this way, how can we not shudder? The purpose of convening you all here today is to discuss this urgent issue of the life and death of trade associations. We should strive with the central government to request a re-amendment. All of you are prominent figures in the business community, and I hope you will all share your opinions. What I have reported is merely the limited perspective of a fool, hoping to elicit valuable insights. The discussion followed, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) Telegram to the central government to stop trade union activities and legally join trade associations; (2) Telegram to the central government that the implementation rules of the Trade Association Law should be re-amended, and that the number of store clerk representatives should be one for every ten or more people and should not exceed two. The above resolutions were forwarded to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Methods for Store Clerks to Join Trade Associations</h3>
<p>▲ Should First Withdraw from the Trade Union</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau regarding a petition. On March 2, the Duck Slaughtering Trade Association sent a letter stating that it had previously received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce asking for clarification on whether duck slaughterers who solicit customers after slaughtering ducks fall under the scope of "employees." This matter was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for instructions. Today, the Chamber of Commerce received Instruction No. 6393 from the Social Affairs Bureau, which stated, "We have received the report. It is stated that all workers in the duck slaughtering industry in this city must be qualified in the business, and they naturally fall within the scope of 'employees.' According to the provisions of Article 10 of the recently revised Implementation Rules of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, when the number of employees exceeds ten, one representative should be added, but the maximum number should not exceed three. Please forward this to the relevant parties for compliance." In response, a letter was forwarded, requesting that the matter be handled accordingly and inquiring whether the workers in question had a trade union organization. It stated, "Our trade's partners already have a duck slaughtering trade union organization and have also signed labor-management contracts. Based on previous practices, all members are notified to inform their partners and legally elect representatives to join." The letter went on to state that duck slaughterers already have a trade union organization, and it is different from cases where trade unions cannot legally exist and their members must be merged into trade associations. Now, according to the instructions from your bureau, these workers are directly serving in the business and should be considered within the scope of employees, and they should elect representatives to join the trade association. If these workers have previously joined the duck slaughtering trade union, it seems that they should be ordered to withdraw from the duck slaughtering trade union before joining the trade association to clarify the boundaries and avoid one person joining two types of organizations, which would undermine the independence of the organization. Is this appropriate? We hereby submit this to your bureau for review and instructions for compliance.</p>
<h3>The Kai Li Shipping Company to Open Coastal Routes in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>▲ Sailings to Commence Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ The primary reason for the establishment is that shipping expert Bao Da-ting, recognizing the large volume of goods transported from various coasts of Eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai, which were usually transported by multiple transshipments without dedicated steamships, resulting in high costs and long times, decided to establish coastal shipping lines in Eastern Zhejiang to facilitate merchants and passengers. He first consulted with Shen Liang-cheng and others, proposing a capital of 500,000 yuan to purchase steamships for sailings to places such as Shenjiamen. Shen also supported this. The matter was prepared in the autumn of last year and has now been established.</p>
<p>▲ Company Name Since Bao Jin Xing began operations, there have been many domestic investors. Qiu Zuo-yin has also joined, and is in charge of the economic aspect, while Shen Liang-cheng has withdrawn from the company. It is named Kai Li Shipping Company, with an initial capital of 100,000 yuan. The head office is located on Guangdong Road in Shanghai, and a 1,000-ton Japanese steamship was purchased from Jenson &amp; Co. for over 50,000 yuan and heavily renovated by Huaxin Chang to add passenger berths. It was only completed yesterday. This ship has an extremely high speed and can travel 11 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<p>▲ Navigation Routes The navigation routes have been determined and divided into long and short routes. A short route will depart every Monday, going from Shanghai to Shengshan, Sijiao, Daishan, Gaoting, Putuo, and Shenjiamen. The long route, on Thursdays, will go from Shanghai to Putuo, Guoji, Hengshan, Wuyu Mountain, Xiangshan, Xizhou, Xiashan, and Xueao (i.e., Xueao). The ship is named Kai Yuan, and the maiden voyage is scheduled for tomorrow. The Shanghai pier is located at Dada Pier No. 3.</p>
<p>▲ Fare Prices Set The company has set the fare prices for various places yesterday. We are reporting them as follows:</p>
<p>Destination	Cabin Fare	Steerage Fare</p>
<p>Shengshan	2.6 yuan	2 yuan</p>
<p>Guoji Mountain	3.6 yuan	2 yuan</p>
<p>Dongshajiao Gaoting	2.4 yuan	1.2 yuan</p>
<p>Guoji Wuyu Mountain	3 yuan	1.6 yuan</p>
<p>Huanglong	3.6 yuan	2 yuan</p>
<p>Sijiao	3.6 yuan	2 yuan</p>
<p>Putuo Shenjiamen	2.4 yuan	1.2 yuan</p>
<p>Baidun Xizhou Xiashan Xueao	3 yuan	1.6 yuan</p>
<h3>Chongsha Shipping Competition Fails</h3>
<p>▲ Six Companies Alliance Cooperation</p>
<p>▲ Today's Meeting to Form Trade Association</p>
<p>▲ Implementing Reduced Sailings and Increased Passenger Fares</p>
<p>With the rise of gold prices, the shipping industry has experienced extreme panic, either raising freight rates or seeking alliances. Since March, various shipping companies have been seeking remedial measures. The previous trend of price competition has vanished and disappeared, replaced by efforts to increase revenue. Due to business relationships, the various shipping companies on the Shanghai-Chongsha route have been experiencing fierce competition since last year. Over the past year, the companies have suffered huge losses. Now, under the impact of high gold prices and low silver prices, they are almost unable to sustain themselves and have to try to salvage the situation. They have abandoned the competition and are cooperating in an alliance. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Competing on the Chongsha Route There are six Shanghai-based merchant ships operating on the Shanghai-Chongsha route: Daxing, Pingan, Jufeng, Dada, Baoji, and Xinxinglong, with six ships, including Fuxing, Baohua, Haimen, and Xinxingda, sailing the route. The route is from Shanghai to Chongming and Haimen. The number of daily sailings has increased to four. The main goods coming from Chongsha are cotton and homespun cloth, while the goods going to Chongsha are North-South goods and foreign miscellaneous goods. With fewer ports of call and a limited number of goods and passengers, the six companies have been competing with all their might in terms of passengers, abandoning fixed fares and competing by lowering prices.</p>
<p>▲ Losses The majority of passengers traveling to and from Chongsha are steerage passengers. The original fare was 60 cents per person. Since the competition between the six companies began, the fares have been reduced several times, eventually selling for 20 cents per person, a reduction of two-thirds of the original amount. Since last year, with four ships sailing daily, there has been a phenomenon of too many ships and too few goods and passengers on this route. The daily revenue from passenger and freight fares has been insufficient to cover fuel and labor costs. The six companies have suffered significant losses since last year.</p>
<p>▲ Relief In recent months, gold prices have been rising, and material costs have been increasing. The six companies have felt the growing hidden losses in their operations, which are unsustainable. Xu Zhongxin of Daxing and Chen Shutang of Pingan have proposed relief measures, suggesting that the six companies should abandon competition and adopt an open cooperative attitude. Following the example of the Shanghai-Taiwan Six Companies' United Navigation Association, they should also operate in an alliance. Xu and others have sought the consent of various companies and decided to change their previous approach, agreeing to organize a common agency to manage the six shipping companies and adopt a public sharing method to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>▲ Alliance The six companies have drafted representatives to go to the Shipping Trade Association today to begin discussing the alliance cooperation method. The principles that have been drafted are: 1. The six companies will jointly form a unified office to manage all shipping operations; 2. The ship schedules will be allocated by the trade association; 3. The number of daily sailings will be reduced to two; 4. The ticket price will be restored to the original price; 5. The freight revenue will be shared equally according to the tonnage of the ships. The general methods are as such. The detailed rules of the alliance, and the percentage of business shared, must wait until the proposal is made today before they can be decided.</p>
<h3>Progress of the New Kang Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>The New Kang Ship Disaster Relief Association discussed litigation issues yesterday. Standing Committee member Mr. Zhu and legal counsel Sheng Zhenwei, a prominent lawyer, had a lengthy discussion. The results of the discussion were: (1) The various witnesses and material evidence for the lawsuits are complete; (2) The complaints have also been drafted; (3) Regarding the litigation relief issue, it was decided that the Disaster Relief Association would submit a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for special assistance; (4) A date will be set to talk to the lawyer representing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; (5) A date will be set to convene a plenary committee meeting.</p>
<h3>After the Autopsy of Zhang Wenyi's Body</h3>
<p>▲ The Body Was Coffined at the Fortress Yesterday</p>
<p>The incident where the body of Zhang Wenyi, the garrison battalion commander of the Wusong Fortress, was privately autopsied by Baolong Hospital has been reported in previous newspapers. The body has been transported back to the fortress in a car and coffined. The family members believe that after Battalion Commander Zhang's death, the hospital dared to autopsy the body without the permission of the family and requested Commander Deng to negotiate with the hospital. Commander Deng approved the transfer of the situation to the Ministry of Military Affairs and Law for strict punishment, in order to warn against illegal acts and maintain humanity. In addition, to commemorate the previous merits of the battalion commander, a memorial service will be held at the fortress on March 9. The adjutant's office has been ordered to prepare everything yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Tragic News of Corpses Waiting to Be Buried in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram from the Shaanxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from the Shaanxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association, reporting that the disaster investigation committee in the western region reported that there were still more than 20,000 corpses unburied in Qian and Mei counties, and the situation was very tragic. The details are disclosed in the following telegram: "To the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross Society and to be forwarded to various charitable organizations and philanthropists: We have received a report from the disaster investigation committee in the western region stating that the disaster is severe in various areas of the western region. Not only are the living freezing and starving to death, but many of the dead have not been buried. Most villages are deserted, and corpses are lying in the rooms, with a foul smell. The tragic situation is hard to describe. For example, there are about 10,000 corpses in Wugong, and there is no way to bury them. Last year, the North China Charity Federation spent more than 10,000 yuan in Qian and Mei counties and only buried over 7,000 corpses. A recent investigation found that there are still more than 20,000 people unburied in these two counties. There are also many unburied in other counties, such as Xingping, Fufeng, and Xianyang. If they are left exposed, not only is it unbearable, but the spring air is gradually warming up, which will inevitably lead to epidemics that will harm the disaster victims who are waiting to die. We want to send personnel to bury them, but there are too many, and we do not have such a large amount of money. We implore you to show compassion and widely appeal to raise funds for the burial, to benefit the dry bones and prevent epidemics. The dead will know and repay the favor, and the living will be spared from the plague and be grateful for your infinite virtue. We hereby appeal to you and ask you to investigate. Shaanxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association, Yang Yin."</p>

<h3>Five Children Infatuated with Wuxia Novels</h3>
<p>Planning to go to Mount Emei to Cultivate Taoism</p>
<p>Envious of Many Swordsmen Soaring Through the Clouds and Riding the Mist</p>
<p>Using Tuition Fees as Travel Expenses to Take a Steamer to Sichuan</p>
<p>One Young Child Homesick and Crying Spoils the Undertaking</p>
<p>Five Children Separately Claimed by Their Families</p>
<p>A year ago, three apprentices from a certain tailor shop in the French Concession became obsessed with old novels, so they went together to a certain mountain temple to become monks and practice. They were eventually sent back by the monks of the temple, and it was rumored throughout Shanghai, and everyone regarded it as a strange story. Unexpectedly, recently there were five children, all over ten years old, who were usually fascinated by reading wuxia novels, and actually also planned to go to Sichuan to cultivate Taoism. Eventually they were found by their families, and the matter did not achieve their ambitions. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Four Children Infatuated with Wuxia Novels Rent a Residence</h3>
<p>Ye Shengchao, a Fujianese lawyer who practices law at No. 82 Jiruili, Jiuda Lane, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, has two sons. The elder son is named Guangyuan, seventeen years old, and the younger son is named Guangji, fifteen years old. They are both studying at the Guohua School on Baker Road in the Public Concession. They are extremely intelligent. Zheng Baoyuan, a Ningbo native residing at No. 78 Nanlinli, Haining Road, Public Concession, also has two sons, the elder named Jingqing, sixteen years old, and the younger named Jingming, eleven years old. They are classmates with the Ye brothers. In recent years, the wuxia novels published by bookstores have become popular in society, and have a great momentum in the novel world. Guangyuan, Guangji and Jingqing are also part of those who like to read them. In their spare time after class, they often each hold a volume, quite oblivious of eating and sleeping. Although Jingming is young, he is happy and tireless when he hears the three of them talking about the martial arts in the book. Therefore, the four children share the same aspirations and admire the so-called great heroes who roam the world in novels, which exceeds all other aspirations. Moreover, various movie theaters often show martial arts films. The four children have witnessed many swordsmen soaring through the clouds and riding the mist, and using all kinds of martial arts methods and magic weapons. This has made them even more infatuated.</p>
<h3>Planning to Go to Sichuan Together to Learn Taoism Last Year</h3>
<p>The school was about to have winter vacation. The four children suddenly proposed taking this opportunity to leave their families and choose a temple in a remote mountain forest with excellent scenery to become monks, practice martial arts. Because they heard that the Emei Mountains in Sichuan Province are the birthplace of great swordsmen, and various schools such as Kunlun, Wudang, and Kongtong gather there. However, they are separated by thousands of miles, which is not within the reach of foot strength. Although there are Sichuan steamer ships in Shanghai, it is difficult to raise the money for the boat fare in a short time. Therefore, they planned to obtain tuition fees from their families when they enter school this year, and use them to change them into travel expenses, and take a steamer to Sichuan. After the plan was decided, they did not publicize it. Later, Jingqing pulled a friend to join, to strengthen their resolve. The friend's name is Pan Yiqin, seventeen years old, the son of Pan Yanzhu, an Anhui native who lives at No. 1001, Siwenli, Datong Road, Xinzha.</p>
<h3>Five Children Bought Steamer Tickets to Yichang Last Month</h3>
<p>On the 22nd, Guangyuan and Guangji, the two brothers, first obtained a total of 230 yuan for tuition and board from their family. Thinking that this money was enough for the five people's travel expenses, they did not wait for Jingqing and others to have money or not, and were anxious to leave. That morning, under the pretext of going to school, they first went to the Andong Hotel at No. 133, Wuma Road, Daxin Street, opened room number 133, and summoned Jingqing, Jingming, and Yiqin, and discussed the steps to go to Sichuan. Later, seeing that there was a person selling steamer tickets in the hotel, they inquired about Sichuan steamers. They learned that the Yichang steamer of the Jiejang Company was departing from Shanghai to Chongqing. The Shanghai port was docked at the Ruitong Iron Factory Wharf in Hudong. The steamer ticket was 30 yuan per person. Five children could buy three steamer tickets in total. Guangyuan and his party thought that Chongqing was an important commercial port in Sichuan. If they arrived there, they would probably not be far from visiting Mount Emei. Therefore, they decided to take the Yichang steamer to Sichuan. They bought three tickets from the ticket seller, totaling 90 yuan, plus food and other expenses of 33 yuan, totaling 123 yuan. They entrusted the person to choose a berth on the steamer on their behalf. The five children stayed in the hotel for two nights, prepared all the luggage they brought, and then took a car to the steamer wharf to board the steamer.</p>
<h3>One Child Cries and is Sent Home Unexpectedly</h3>
<p>The steamer did not depart for a while. The five children stayed on the steamer for several days. Jingming eventually because of his young age, it was difficult to get rid of the thought of his family. Moreover, except for the four people traveling together, he felt even more uneasy seeing strangers. He cried all the time. The day before yesterday, his brother Jingqing decided to send him home, and he still returned to the steamer. His father, Zheng Baoyuan, had been looking for his two sons for many days. He was overjoyed to see his younger son returning home. After inquiring about the details, he was overjoyed and surprised. In addition to notifying the families of the other three children, he also entrusted Gu Yuenian and Liang Gengshun, two members of the Special Zone Citizens Association, to report to the water patrol police station first. The head of the police station ordered Chinese detective Deng Jiageng to find the four children in the steerage of the steamer, and brought them and their luggage to the police station for disposal.</p>
<h3>The Ambition to Cultivate Taoism Suddenly Suffers a Blow</h3>
<p>When the five children boarded the steamer, they brought several pieces of luggage, including a suitcase, two sets of bedding, a rattan basket, and a wallet, which contained a boxing diagram, two Shaolin boxing books, and many other martial arts books and wuxia novels. They also brought an alarm clock, a thermos, a Yueqin, and nourishing products such as white fungus and ginseng, and a lot of scattered clothes. After the children arrived at the police station, the head of the police station questioned their names and origins, and found seven silver dollars next to Guangyuan. It is said that the rest had been used up. He then sent Chinese detective Cheng Yongnian to the original hotel to return the ticket price and other expenses. Then the four children were handed over to their respective families to be taken away. Therefore, the five children's ambition to leave home to go to Sichuan to cultivate Taoism was not fulfilled.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Involved in Kidnapping Liu Tongyun, Miao Liancheng, is Arrested</h3>
<p>▲ Hiding in Taopeng Road, Hongkou</p>
<p>▲ Detectives Secretly Go to Arrest</p>
<p>Liu Tongyun, a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, opened the Fuji Paper Shop in Chunjiangli, Dagou Bridge, Public Concession. Because his business was prosperous, he was coveted by bandits. He was kidnapped by bandits at about 8 pm on September 19 last year. After several negotiations, it was heard that he was redeemed by paying money. However, the police station, because the kidnapping wind in the concession was rampant, was greatly related to public security, so Chinese and foreign detectives were investigating day and night. Yesterday afternoon, Shao Jingfan, the detective of the Gordon Road Police Station, and detectives Wang Youshan and Xu Decheng, received a tip from an informant that the bandit leader who kidnapped Liu Tongyun was now hiding at No. 774 Jichengfang, Taopeng Road, Hongkou. After Shao Detective received the news, he reported to the head of the police station, and together with foreign detectives, prepared weapons, drove a patrol car, and went straight to Hongkou. After connecting to the address to arrest him, he immediately captured the bandit Miao Liancheng, a native of Jiangbei, and also found contraband in his home, and brought him back to the police station. After the head of the police station briefly questioned him, he scheduled him to be sent to the court for trial today.</p>
<h3>Female Nun Qing Shan Steals and Excavates the Coffin of Her Seventh-Generation Ancestor</h3>
<p>▲ A Thief in the Lujia Guanyintang</p>
<p>▲ Stealing and Selling Two Mu and Six Fen of Land</p>
<p>Lin Gen, the abbess of the Lujia Guanyintang on Changbang Road in the Public Concession, hired a lawyer to write a complaint and filed a criminal lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court against her rebellious disciple Qing Shan, who colluded with land dealers to steal and sell her ancestral tombs, and at night excavate the coffin of her seventh-generation ancestral master, and discard the bones. The court has approved the petition and ordered a summons for investigation. The details are extracted and recorded below.</p>
<p>Qing Shan is Not Qing Shan. Lujia Guanyintang is the Lu Family Nunnery. It is now presided over by the old nun Lin Gen. There are a total of five nuns. Qing Shan is Lin Gen's disciple, currently forty-four years old. She became a nun halfway through life and lives in the same room with Lin Gen. Later, because Qing Shan did not abide by the precepts and ate opium, she owed a lot of private debts. At the end of last year, she could not repay them, so she stole the land deed and grain string of the tomb to pledge for silver dollars. Later, a land dealer found out and colluded to steal and sell them.</p>
<p>▲ Taking Advantage of the Fire Alarm to Steal the Deed The tomb is located along Hongqiao Road, covering an area of two mu and six fen. There are seven coffins buried (Lin Gen's seventh-generation ancestral master). The land deed was originally hidden by Lin Gen in a leather box in the room. At the beginning of December of the previous year, there was a siren sound outside the nunnery. The nun suspected that there was a fire alarm, took out the land deed and other items, placed them under the pillow, and then went outside to investigate. She learned that it was a theft by a certain family nearby, and she was relieved. However, the land deed was not stored in the box at the time, so it was stolen by the rebellious disciple Qing Shan.</p>
<p>Workers Come to Dig the Coffin After the land deed was stolen, Qing Shan went out and did not return. Until a certain night last month, several workers came to the tomb and excavated all seven coffins buried there, putting all the bones together and taking them away. It is not known where they were thrown. The next day, someone reported to the nunnery. The abbess Lin Gen and her disciples went to see and immediately called the person in charge of the tomb to inquire about the excavation situation. Only then did they learn that it had been stolen and sold by Qing Shan.</p>
<p>Taking Photos to Collect Evidence The old nun took a photographer to the tomb the day before yesterday and took three photos: (1) seven empty coffins dug out of the soil; (2) old boundary stones; (3) tombs that were excavated and destroyed, etc. She prepared to present these photos to the court for inspection when the court summons her. However, the nun has now found that the land guard Ye did not come to the scene to seal the deed when the tomb was stolen and sold, and has found that the bones dug out of the soil have now been buried in a certain public cemetery.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Assassin of Zhao Tieqiao</h3>
<p>▲ Strict Interrogation of the Instigator</p>
<p>▲ The Court Forbids Public Attendance</p>
<p>The assassins of Zhao Tieqiao, Xia Shaoen, Wang Jishan, and Cheng Haihong, have been prosecuted by the local court. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, Judge Zhao opened the court. Xia Shaoen confessed that he was from Hefei, Anhui. In January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, he went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and was introduced by Ren Shaolan and Xu Cairen. He was a soldier with a monthly salary of fifteen yuan. After ten months, they were all dismissed. I don't know Chief Zhao. Because I was stationed in Yangjiadu, Pudong, he never came. After I was dismissed, I sold vegetables for a living. I didn't hit him. I heard from the detective that if I admitted three halls at the procuratorate, I could be released, otherwise I would be tortured. The official said, you are like an executioner, killing people after receiving instructions from others. You must tell the truth. Who instigated you? The law has different degrees of severity. There is no need to suffer for others. Xia still denied it. Because it was noon, he was ordered to be taken down. In the afternoon, the interrogation continued, because the strict interrogation was related to the instigator, public attendance was forbidden. It is heard that the trial will continue.</p>
<h3>An Unnamed Male Corpse Found on Dong Tiyu Road</h3>
<p>▲ About Twenty Years Old</p>
<p>▲ Wearing a Long Robe on the Outside and a Western Suit on the Inside</p>
<p>Next to the Dongyang Garden on Dong Tiyu Road, Jiangwan, at around 7 o'clock yesterday morning, an unnamed male corpse was found, about twenty years old. He was wearing a black serge cotton robe with a velvet lining, a black Western suit, a vest velvet shirt, black serge Western suit pants, gray cotton socks, and no shoes. After receiving the report, the public security bureau of the fifth district dispatched the police to inspect. There seemed to be no obvious injuries on his body. What was different was that it had been raining for the past two days, but there was no mud on the deceased's socks. There was also a faint blue and purple color on his forehead. The office reported to the local court to request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>The British Assize Court Opens the Trial of the Indian Police Bestiality Case</h3>
<p>On January 19, the case of Sari Xin, an Indian gatekeeper of a yarn factory, raping three young girls aged eleven or twelve, was pre-tried by the British Police Court and established. The trial was held in the Assize Court on Monday this week. Royal Inspector Mo Su prosecuted, and lawyer Tai Gaowen defended the defendant. There were five jurors. Juror Peel was also designated, but he was absent and fined five pounds according to law. After the court opened, the defendant pleaded not guilty, so the witnesses were summoned for questioning first. The trial could not be completed on that day and was postponed to Tuesday for continuation.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Eager to Buy Dahua Real Estate</h3>
<p>▲ Someone is Willing to Buy the Land of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that although the discussion about the Municipal Council acquiring the Dahua Hotel property has not yet materialized, the atmosphere of approval from all parties is becoming increasingly strong. It was heard yesterday that someone had contacted the Municipal Council, willing to buy the Municipal Council's existing address for 3.84 million taels, while the Dahua property owner also expressed willingness to sell it to the public for 4.10151 million taels. The Dahua address covers a total of 58 mu and 5 fen and 9 li, which is about 70,000 taels per mu. However, the Municipal Council has not yet discussed this proposal. According to the authorities, a formal consideration can only be made after consulting the taxpayers. According to the Shanghai Evening Post, the Municipal Council Board of Directors may conduct a general discussion at the regular meeting on Wednesday this week.</p>
<h3>A Laborer Jumps Off a Car to Pick Up a Hat</h3>
<p>▲ Dies Miserably with a Broken Head</p>
<p>At around 2 pm the day before yesterday, a truck carrying goods and many laborers was driving from south to north on Henan Road at a very fast speed. At that time, the wind and rain were intensifying, blowing the hat of laborer Yu Yousheng to the ground. Yu wanted to pick up his hat, but without telling the driver to stop, he jumped out of the car, damaging his head. Fresh blood gurgled out, and he died on the way. The patrol officer at the scene reported to the police station, and the police dispatched a detective to the scene and carried the corpse to the Fielun Road autopsy site. It was then found that the deceased was from Ningbo, 22 years old, and lived at No. 7 Xiexingli, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, with his parents. After notifying the deceased's father, Yu Laicheng, he first went to the autopsy site yesterday morning and reported to the Special Court to send Prosecutor Guo to the site for an autopsy. He was instructed to hand over the body to Laicheng to claim the coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Traffic Accidents in the Concession Last Month</h3>
<p>According to the Traffic Department of the Public Concession Police Station, the number of traffic accidents in the concession last month decreased slightly compared to January, with a total of 853 cases, 6 deaths, and 240 injuries. It was found that there were a total of 950 cases in January, 8 deaths, and 262 injuries, which were more than in February. However, compared with the same period last year, it has increased by more than 80 cases.</p>
<h3>Responsibility Issues in Car Collisions</h3>
<p>▲ No Evidence After Investigation</p>
<p>▲ Dong Aru Released on Bail</p>
<p>Dou Jinyuan, the owner of the Xingfa Automobile Company on Disui Road, drove car No. 17846 on the night of the 28th of last month, driven by driver Wang Afu, and drove from south to north to the intersection of Baoding Road and Tangshan Road. At that time, Dong Aru, the driver of the Yunfei Automobile Company in the French Concession, was driving car No. 12342, carrying three daughters, two young children, and passed by the place, from west to east. Then, with a loud bang, the two cars collided. The passengers were severely shaken. Fortunately, the women and children were unharmed. Only Dou Jinyuan was severely injured. The police inquired and found that the accident was caused by Dong Aru, and immediately arrested him and sent Dou to the hospital. Unfortunately, he was severely injured and the treatment was ineffective. He died shortly after. The Special District Local Court was reported, and the prosecutor was appointed to conduct an autopsy. He ordered the corpse to be coffined and buried, and the police station investigated the circumstances of the accident to determine responsibility. However, after investigation, there was no sufficient evidence to determine who was at fault, and it was not easy to determine at the time. Therefore, it was not convenient to detain Dong any further. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court, and the police station lawyer stated that before obtaining conclusive evidence, he requested that Dong Aru be released on bail, and the police station would continue to conduct the investigation. Judge Xiao, because the victim</p>

<p>side had no family members appearing in court and had not filed a lawsuit, briefly questioned Dong and approved the police station's request, ordering Dong to provide a shop guarantee of 1,000 yuan to leave and wait for review.</p>
<h3>Ge and Hu in the Gonghe Steamer Case Escorted to Wuhu for Trial</h3>
<p>In the Gonghe steamer case, the procuratorate of the local court of the city stated that the case should be handled by the Wuhu Local Court. The comprador Shen Huating has now surrendered himself to Wuhu to await questioning. Ge Shuchen and Hu Hanzhang, who were detained, were ordered yesterday to be escorted to Wuhu by the bailiff's office for handling.</p>
<h3>Datong and Dabe Can Temporarily Transfer Telegrams via Water Line</h3>
<p>▲ Chuanshi Mountain and Gulangyu</p>
<p>▲ Only for One Month</p>
<p>Since the borrowing lines of Chuanshi Mountain and Gulangyu in Fuzhou and Xiamen have been recovered, all telegrams sent to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou and other places are sent by the local Chinese Telegraph Office. It is now learned that the office has recently received an order from the Ministry of Communications, temporarily allowing Datong and Dabe Companies to use water lines to transfer telegrams in Chuanshi Mountain and Gulangyu from March 1 for a period of one month, but they are not allowed to directly receive or send to the public. The right to receive and send is still in the hands of our country's Chuan and Gu Telegraph Offices. Therefore, the right to send telegrams to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou and other places received by Datong and Dabe Companies in recent days must still be managed by the Chinese Telegraph Offices in Fuzhou, Xiamen and other places. The price of the telegram, in addition to the cost of the line, must be increased by one-half of the water line cost, and the cost of the telegram is actually half more expensive than that of the Chinese Telegraph Office. Moreover, the direct line from Shanghai to Fuzhou of the Chinese Telegraph Office is exceptionally smooth since the major repairs. All telegrams sent to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Xiantou, Quanzhou, Guangzhou and various parts of Guangdong cost only one dime per word for clear text and Chinese, and only two dimes per word for secret text and foreign languages.</p>
<h3>Fighting Over Reed Mats Results in Death</h3>
<p>The Kaiping Bureau in Pudong has the Ganfu steamer. It loaded flour the night before, and Xiao Wuzi, a laborer from Jiangbei, Zhang Dayizi, 45 years old, were all working. Because of the heavy rain, they stopped working and slept at the bow of the ship. They clashed over a reed mat, pulling, twisting, pushing, and hitting each other. Zhang Dayizi fell to the ground unconscious. Colleagues tried to rescue him, but he did not breathe and died on the ship. The water patrol police station arrested Tian and sent Zhang's body to the Lifesaving Bureau for an autopsy. Yesterday, Tian was escorted to the court for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Martial Arts Drama in Front of Gaochang Temple</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that after the clash between the workers of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant and the ticket seller of the China Merchants Tram Company in front of Gaochang Temple, the fourth and first tram lines stopped at the South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. As of yesterday, they had not resumed. The injured people in the hospital have not changed, and their lives are expected to be saved. As of yesterday, the China Merchants Tram Company had sent an official letter to Chen Shaokuan, the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the tram association proposed four requests to the company in the afternoon. The Jiangnan Shipyard Labor Union also issued a declaration. However, it was heard that Lu Bohong said that the negotiations on transportation were two different things. What should be negotiated should be negotiated, and the traffic from the station to Gaochang Temple should also be requested by the labor union to resume first. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched inspectors to investigate the scene of the incident and ordered the trams to resume operations first. Chen Shaokuan is scheduled to come to Shanghai today and tomorrow, and he should be able to handle it properly.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice in the Xinxin Embezzlement Case is Apprehended</h3>
<p>▲ Bian Chansheng Left Without Saying Goodbye</p>
<p>▲ Apprehended From His Hometown and Escorted to Shanghai</p>
<p>When the Xinxin Company's textiles department experienced a turmoil in the past, employees colluded with each other to embezzle more than 180,000 yuan. It was not discovered until last winter. The embezzling employees had successively resigned, leaving only one person. He voluntarily surrendered, and the case of embezzling a large amount of money was exposed. Detective Wang Changgen arrested several people and sent them to the Special District Local Court, which sentenced them to imprisonment. The company took into account the remorse of the one who surrendered and gave him a chance to start anew and did not pursue the matter. The police station stipulated in a special article that the leniency of surrender could not exempt him from all criminal penalties, so he was still prosecuted according to law and was also convicted, but he was sentenced to a lenient suspended sentence. When that person surrendered and reported the crime, Bian Chansheng, an employee of the textiles department from Qingshan, Huzhou, suddenly abandoned his job and fled. The company initially thought that he was also a member of the embezzlement group. When the Zhang and other four people were arrested, they confessed that Bian was indeed an accomplice. The Laozha Police Station sent detectives Liu Junqing and Wang Yingjie to Bian's hometown to arrest him and escort him to Shanghai. He was sent to the Special Court yesterday, but he denied participating in the fraud, saying that he had been working in the textiles department since the opening of Xinxin, and resigned and returned to his hometown on December 17 last year. However, according to Li Minzhou, the manager of the company, the defendant left without saying goodbye and had not gone through the resignation approval procedures. Judge Zhou ordered the defendant to be detained and questioned again on Saturday.</p>
<h3>A Libertine</h3>
<p>▲ Died of Syphilis</p>
<p>Li Yuyi, an employee of a silversmith shop at No. 339 Shanhai Pass Road, was only 27 years old. He liked to engage in promiscuous activities and often went on clandestine tours outside of work. As a result, he contracted syphilis, which gradually worsened. On New Year's Day of the Gregorian calendar, taking advantage of the work stoppage, he went to a hospital in Ximen for treatment, but the poison had entered his bones and was incurable. The morning before yesterday, he took a rickshaw back to the shop, and as he was about to arrive, he fell backward in the rickshaw, his eyes closed, and his face suddenly changed. The police officer at post No. 1665 saw him on the way and stopped the rickshaw. After questioning the rickshaw driver, he immediately ordered him to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he was already dead. The police officer reported to the police station and ordered him to be sent to the Fielun Road autopsy site. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo of the Special Court came to the site to conduct an autopsy. After the police station summoned his cousin Li Liangyu to the case for questioning, he ordered Li to issue a certificate to claim the body for coffin and burial.</p>

Based on his experience of celestial time, luck, and experience, he published an article predicting this spring's epidemic, which is thousands of words. The following is excerpted for the citizens' information: "The winter was severely cold, and there was a large amount of snowfall after the beginning of spring. The cold and dry air is very pervasive. According to the ancient theory of luck, it is appropriate for fire and heat to be used. Therefore, the disease this spring should be dominated by lung diseases. The most common is dry cough, followed by sore throat. Cooling and clearing should be used for both. The influenza symptoms, initially seeing fear of cold, headache, desire to cough, limb weakness, stiff neck, and red urine, are especially prone to stagnation and heat, making people confused. At the beginning, sweating too much is not allowed, and in the middle, cooling and moisturizing too much is not allowed. Nowadays, many people mistakenly think that headache and stiff neck are what Western medicine calls spinal meningitis, but it is similar but not the same."</p>
<h3>The Ship Collision Case Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>On January 2 this year, He Jinsheng's ship collided with the Northern Navigation Company's Beifu vessel near the Dalai Wharf in Huangpu. He Jinsheng's cargo was immediately sunk at the time, and a crew member, Wu Laohu, was drowned. After several negotiations and mediation by the Shanghai County Government, an agreement was reached yesterday. As a result, the Beifu vessel decided to pay He Jinsheng 1,000 yuan for the damaged cargo, and 300 yuan to the family of Wu Laohu, who was drowned. The district chief and township chief concerned agreed on the spot, and with the permission of the Shanghai County Government, both parties signed a certificate. The case has been completely closed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai News: Annual Shareholders' Meeting of the Bank of East Asia</h3>
<p>▲ Zhou Shouchen Reports on Progress</p>
<p>On February 22nd, at 3:00 PM, the Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong held its annual shareholders' meeting at its office. Attendees included Chairman of the Board Zhou Shouchen, directors Feng Pingshan, Li Guanchun, Huang Runtang, Jian Yingfu, Guo Youting, Chen Chengshi, Huang Zhuchen, shareholder and General Manager Jian Dongpu, Manager Li Zifang, shareholders Guo Shaojian, Pan Xiaochu, Tan Yashi, Li Lansheng, Zhou Shinan, and others. Chairman Zhou Shouchen reported on the business situation, stating: "Esteemed shareholders, today is the date of the annual shareholders' meeting of this bank. I am very pleased to gather with you all once again. The financial statements for 1930, along with the reports from the Board of Directors and auditors, have been duly attached and submitted. I trust you will examine them thoroughly. Following the Hong Kong custom, I will simply read them aloud and refrain from further elaboration. The financial statements for 1930, combined with the 447,994.65 yuan carried over from the previous year, show a net profit of 1,456,425.01 yuan. Recalling last year, business was sluggish not only in Guangdong and Hong Kong but also worldwide. Yet, this bank still achieved this result, which I believe will satisfy all shareholders and is cause for celebration for the bank's future. Examining the business situation of the past year, the bank's deposits, mortgages, and remittances have all increased. Due to the increase in deposit income, the head office and branches have vigorously promoted mortgage business. The Board of Directors has reviewed the mortgage collateral and considers it to be very secure. The bank's decorations, furniture, and miscellaneous items were previously written down to one yuan. Last year, all expenses for decorations and furniture were accounted for as expenses, so no further funds need to be spent on decorations and furniture in the future. To strengthen the foundation of the bank, the Board of Directors proposes to allocate 500,000 yuan from last year's profits to the surplus reserve. Combined with the 1.75 million yuan from the previous year, this totals 2.25 million yuan, accounting for 45% of the capital. The Board of Directors believes that increasing the surplus reserve is a very good measure, and I trust you will agree. The Board of Directors proposes to pay a dividend of six yuan per share and a bonus of two yuan per share for 1930, the same as the previous year. During this time of global difficulty, the bank's business has achieved these results thanks to the diligence and dedication of our managers and staff. The Board of Directors is very grateful. However, we have noticed that the cost of living has been rising, so we have allocated an extra bonus from last year's profits to give to all staff members as a salary increase to encourage them. I trust you will all support this. Besides what I have mentioned above, there is nothing else to report. I propose that this annual report be approved. Now that this motion has been seconded, if anyone has any questions, I will gladly answer them."</p>
<h3>"Singing Girl Red Peony" Previewed at the Guanglu Theater Yesterday</h3>
<p>"Singing Girl Red Peony," China's first full-dialogue and singing film, produced by the Minzhong National Film Company, filmed by the Star Film Company, and recorded by Pathe Records, took six months and cost 120,000 yuan. It has now been completed. Yesterday, at 10:00 AM, a special preview was held at the Guanglu Theater on Museum Road. Over 600 people attended with invitations, including members of the press, the film industry, various celebrities, and representatives from Paramount, Fox, and other companies stationed in Shanghai. First, Ju Jianyun took the stage to report on the film's production and sound recording process, bringing together talent from both Star and Pathe companies. After much research and effort, the sound recording was scrapped four times before succeeding on the fifth attempt. The difficulty of the work and the spirit of meticulousness can be imagined. The screening began at 10:30 AM. The film is 13,000 feet long and divided into 18 reels. Those in attendance expressed great satisfaction with the film's moving plot, profound performances, clear sound, and excellent tone. Many female guests were moved to tears. The screening ended at 12:30 PM, and many Chinese and foreign guests shook hands with key Star employees to congratulate them on their success. Several first-run theaters in the city are competing for the right to premiere the film, and a decision will be made within three days.</p>

<h3>Vendors on Minguo Road Set Up Stalls Against the Wall</h3>
<p>In the French Concession's Minguo Road area, since the establishment of vendor stalls, the police have never interfered. However, recently, most of the stalls have been set up half on the steps and half in the middle of the road, obstructing traffic and causing inconvenience to pedestrians and shops alike, creating a sense of impossibility. Therefore, all the shops reported to the Grand Auto Bell Police Station. The head of detectives, Mr. Folangdeng, personally went to Minguo Road and gently persuaded the vendors to set up their stalls against the wall of the shops to facilitate traffic. At that time, all the vendors gladly complied. As a result, both pedestrians and shops were facilitated, and everyone praised Mr. Folangdeng's virtuous governance.</p>

<h3>China's Road Administration Today and the Work of the Road Association</h3>
<p>— Da Dao</p>
<p>—Report by Road Association Representative Mr. Ye Keliang at the American Road Builders' Association Convention—</p>
<p>The American Road Builders' Association held its 28th annual convention in St. Louis from January 10th to 16th this year. The local Road Association was invited to send a representative to participate. Wang Zhengting, the president of the Road Association, telegraphed Ye Keliang, the Consul General stationed in Chicago, to represent the association. Yesterday, Mr. Ye reported on the convention's proceedings and sent over 40 types of brochures describing road construction equipment. The translated excerpts of the representative's speech are as follows for the reference of those concerned with road administration. Details of the meeting will be translated continuously. Mr. Ye's speech mentioned that he represents the Chinese government and the National Roads Construction Association of China and extends sincere greetings to all members and representatives of the Association. The improvement of China's roads is a prerequisite for the national construction plan of the National Government. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Revolution, stipulated in his outline of national construction that one million miles of crushed stone roads must be built throughout the country. At present, the foundation of our country's government is becoming more stable. We are adopting new methods to strive for the construction of a new China, which is easier than in the past.</p>
<p>On May 23, 1929, the National Design Committee, presided over by the Ministry of Railways, held a meeting in Nanjing that lasted for about three months. It completed various important plans for road construction. The designated national road system is divided into two major parts: the headquarters and border defense, with a total of twelve trunk lines to be completed in four phases. This is truly good news for the construction of a new China. However, due to the initial stabilization of the overall situation and a shortage of funds, while road construction cannot be delayed, it was decided to build dirt roads first and then gradually improve them. In recent years, the road-building movement has been booming throughout the country. The headquarters routes have been opened to traffic in sections, which shows that our country is now striving to promote this transportation in order to fully develop the transportation industry. Since the abolition of the likin tax, the new tax rates adopted by our country recently have greatly benefited this. The gasoline tax has been reduced from 1.75% to 1.70% per box, and the kerosene tax has also been reduced. Only the petroleum tax has been slightly increased. The road construction machinery tax has also been reduced from 10% to 7.5%, and the agricultural machinery tax has been reduced from 10% to 5%. Only the automobile tax has been increased from 22.5% to 30%, and the truck tax has been increased from 12.5% to 20%.</p>
<p>The Road Association is a committee of the Pan-Pacific Association. The chairman is Dr. Wang Zhengting, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Road Association. After the dissolution of the wife committee, the Road Association was formed to replace it. The association is engaged in road construction propaganda, which has attracted the attention of the whole country. It publishes the Road Monthly, the Road Encyclopedia, and other books on road engineering, plans the national automobile road network, investigates the transportation situation in various provinces, introduces road engineering specialists, purchases road construction machinery, answers road market inquiries, and encourages members' enthusiasm for road construction. It also establishes branches in various provinces and regions, all to the extent of its capabilities, in order to complete the great cause of building roads throughout the country. The association has been established for ten years and its efforts have paid off considerably. The newly built roads amount to more than 100,000 li. In most cities, the city walls have been demolished and replaced with tree-lined streets. In the northwestern provinces, the association's chief executive, Wu Shan, earnestly joined in the construction of large mountain roads, opening up the millennia-old dangerous Xiaohan passage and building a 1,700-li automobile road connecting Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, with a width of 60 feet. The journey that used to take months can now be completed in just a few days. The association also plans to open a road engineering specialty school and a road market model library exhibition hall. Currently, to celebrate its 10th anniversary, it has announced that it will hold a road market exhibition in Shanghai in April this year, soliciting various road administration-related machinery, charts, models, specimens, etc. for display to the people of the country in order to promote the improvement of road market policies.</p>
<p>Last November, the association asked the National Government to issue a nationwide order for the regular troops to participate in the construction of national roads in order to realize the purpose of turning soldiers into workers and to ensure the early success of the roads that crisscross the country. In short, China's road construction does not lack manpower. Whenever needed, people arrive immediately. Guizhou, a poor province in China, felt the need to build roads, so the provincial authorities started work with 200,000 people. In just one winter, they built</p>
<h3>Public Buses Also Have Classes</h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>The concept of class is very deep in French Morocco in Africa. The Chevrolet public bus in the picture has three classes: first, second, and third. The front half of the bus is first class, the back is second class, and the top is last class, for poor laborers. The top is extraordinarily small, barely enough for one or two people. The dangerous situation can be seen in the picture. The local authorities do not prevent this.</p>

<h3>Chevrolet's New Car with Many Styles</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>▲ Nine Types of Car Bodies ▲ Wheelbase Two Inches Wider Than Old Cars</p>
<p>This publication has already published articles on new cars from various manufacturers, so there is no need to repeat them. However, the Chevrolet 1931 new car has been released recently, and the variety of car body styles and the excellent internal structure are even better than the others. Therefore, the various advantages are described in detail to the readers as follows.</p>
<p>▲ High Reputation: The Chevrolet 1931 new car has nine different car body styles. This time, automobile exhibitions have been held one after another in various parts of the United States. Guests who saw the many Chevrolet new cars praised them and were praised for two months. The wheelbase of various new cars is two inches wider than the old cars, and the width of the car room is also better than the old cars. As for the beauty of the appearance and the elegance of the paint, they are even more minor matters. The two-inch wider wheelbase makes the car wheels one inch and nine inches long, which greatly improves the safety of passengers when driving. The new fish-shaped car body is wider in all parts, but the top is lower. In terms of appearance, the lines are reduced, and the front is painted with a crest pattern, which is particularly unique. The lowering of the driver's seat makes it easier to see when driving and makes the front crossbar parallel to the windshield. In this way, the windshield can also increase safety and is not easy to break.</p>
<p>▲ Complete Accessories: The side panels are also longer than the old cars, but the front is much narrower. The back is constructed using a new method. The storage tank is placed at the back and is not exposed at all. As for the car doors, they can be closed by hand, regardless of whether they are front or rear. All kinds of new cars have new car door devices. As for the inside of the car room, all kinds of accessories are available. Such as cigarette ash boxes, armrests, pure silk curtains, etc., are particularly characteristic. All doors and windows are automatically closed. The rear of the touring car is wide. When the car tent is folded, it is just in the place of the rear seat, which is very convenient because there is no glass window. In terms of the mechanical structure, the improvements are particularly outstanding. Such as the division of the car room, the convenience of driving, the durability of the meshing parts, and the convenience of the transmission function are all unique to ordinary vehicles. There are four hydraulic shock absorbers, and there are four-wheel brakes. In addition to various touring special heat reducers, there are also lead objects covering them. Steel wire wheels and hub caps are also made of aluminum, as are the front and rear car lights. Therefore, the device of the new car is quite complete.</p>
<p>▲ Enlarged Car Top: The car top of the new car is also longer than the old car. The highest point is like a crown. The front railing is larger, and the rods in the railing are made of metal. The semicircular shape connects the railings one by one. The horn is installed on the front, just below the left car light, and the power of the heat reducer is particularly strong. The driving wheel has three spokes, while the old car has four. In terms of ratio, the new car is from twelve to one, while the old car is from nine and five to one. The six-cylinder new car has a horsepower of up to 50 horsepower. The piston installed in the front engine is based on the one invented in 1928 and modified. Therefore, it is both glossy and durable. The crank rod is also stronger than in the past. A rubber boot is placed on top of the carburetor and accelerator. In this way, even in cold weather, the water will not freeze, and the transmission function is also quite powerful. There is really nothing that is not perfect.</p>
<h3>New Nash Cars of 1931</h3>
<p>— (Ji Ren)</p>
<p>Shown are four 1931 new Nash cars. The selling price is lower than before, but the value is even higher. The purpose is to remedy the impact of today's precious gold and cheap silver so that new car owners will not suffer losses. The four new Nash cars listed above are: the new Commander Twin Ignition Eight-Cylinder No. 97 sedan (top left), the new Six-Cylinder Five-Seat Four-Door No. 60 sedan with the lowest price (top right), the new Twin Ignition Eight-Cylinder No. 80 sedan (bottom left), and the new American Five-Seat Four-Door Eight-Cylinder No. 77 special sedan (bottom right). The interior of the Chinese Nash car has many comfortable and beautiful features.</p>

<h3>Harbin Limits the Number of Passengers in Cars</h3>
<p>— Che</p>
<p>Harbin is a key point of the China Eastern Railway and an important town in Jiang Province. Therefore, the population is very dense and commerce is prosperous. The road construction is no less than that of Beijing and Shanghai. The traffic of cars is naturally convenient, but the restriction on the number of passengers carried by cars is quite strict. The special police department is deeply aware that the arbitrary carrying of passengers by cars is a source of danger and must be banned. Therefore, at the end of last month, it issued an order to the Great Automobile Association, stating that Article 88 of the regulations of the municipal traffic management department stipulates that large cars are limited to carrying 15 people in winter and spring and 17 people in summer and autumn, excluding the driver and ticket seller. If it is a Ford card, it is only allowed to carry 14 people in winter and spring and 16 people in summer and autumn. It has long been submitted for publication and has been implemented for a long time. However, in the winter of the 18th year, the Harbin Great Automobile Association reported that during the military period, many soldiers rode without tickets. In addition, staff from various agencies were exempt from tickets, which led to a sharp reduction in income for each car and requested an increase of two seats. This department gave special approval to show expediency. It is currently found that the military period is long gone, and the free ticket vouchers for staff from various agencies have also been stopped. The original reason for increasing the number of seats does not exist at this time. Moreover, large cars carrying passengers beyond the number stipulated in the regulations exceed the weight limit, which is most likely to cause danger. As far away as the tragic train accident at Bazhan and as close as the cases of Nos. 541, 579, and 488 large cars hitting pedestrians, although the cause of the accident was the driver's negligence, the main reason was that too many passengers were carried, making it impossible to move freely. The volume of large cars is limited, and too many passengers are crowded, which not only hinders public health but also provides opportunities for thieves to commit crimes. There are countless drawbacks. In order to maintain public order and prevent danger, this department must restore the original regulations on the number of seats carried by large cars.</p>
