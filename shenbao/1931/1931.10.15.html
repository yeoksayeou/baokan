<h3>國聨請美代表列席</h3>
<p>張海鵬率兵由洮昂路侵黑境日軍五列車昨開到馬山家子通遼軍匪激戰日機擲助匪</p>
<h3>國聨行政會昨開秘密會議</h3>
<p>决請美國代表列席日本堅持直接交涉</p>
<p>（日内瓦）午前行政會開秘密會議、中日兩國代表未出席、其所討論之問題、如美代表之可　參加處置滿洲爭端之行政會會議、討論頗久、十一時許散會、嗣聞關於邀請美代表列席層、已有同意、惟如何决議、須俟午後舉行公開會議時、方可知悉、美代表吉爾白係日内瓦美領事、已奉美政府訓令列席於行政會公開會議、但美國非國聨會員、故美代表無發言權、美國對於遠東事態、極爲注意、且援助國聨所已採行之步驟、故衆覺如行政會能設法使吉爾白參加會議、而有以其政府名義在公開會議時發表言論之自由、則爲最佳之事、如果辦到、則美國代表之列席於賴前威爾遜總統大爲出力得以組成之國聨行政會、乃第一次事也、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨行政會秘密會議决定請美代表參加行政會關於中日交涉之討論、聞此辦法須先得中日兩國代表之同意、行政會開會後、中日代表皆晤會白里安、聞中國對此已表同意、惟日代表芳澤與白里安晤談良久之後、聲明必須將邀請美國參加行政會討論一事、請示於日政府、故衆料在未接東京訓示時、行政會暫不開會、至少今日不能開會、日代表團某要人今日語路透訪員、歐洲請國尚未深悉時局中之實際詳情、如日僑獲有不遭攻擊之保障、日本即準備撤軍至鐵路區域、日本在滿洲軍隊計一萬四千人、而在鐵路區域外者不足六千人、日人不贊成此事當衆過分討索、日人確信直接談判乃最後結果云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中日雙方代表堅持其地位、未有讓步氣象、但今晨稍有希望之空氣、昨晨旣有惶慮、又有興味、今日則興味不減、而惶慮較少、殆因雙方昨有温和之表示也、衆預料行政會必續開公開會議、故午前到會者頗多、但公開會議須展緩至午後、因午前開秘密會議、討論可否請美代表於考慮滿洲事件時列席於行政會、秘密討論午前九時半在議長白里安之寓所開始、白里安本定昨日午後召集未參加秘密會議之行政會會員、告以經過情形、但因昨日午後公開會議歷時稍久、故未果、白里安現在以行政會滿案委員會之討論詳情、通知未參加之各會員、國聨深知時局之困難、而國聨之最後决定、又旣爲人注意、今雙方尚堅持不讓、日本代表欲先開直接談判、而不問滿洲日軍之現在地位、中國代表則堅欲日本首先將其軍隊撤回南滿鐵路區域、聞今晨中代表團接到莫斯科私人消息、據謂上海日人攻擊華人商店、中代表已電詢南京、此說是否屬實、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法外長白里安曾約定於今晨九時三十分再開理事會、研究東省時局、作爲今日下午白氏與中日總代表會商之準備、白氏擬使事件迅速進行、期於本星期秒獲得一種協定辦法、俾中日可以開始外交談判、而日兵亦可撤至南滿鐵路區域以内、依目前局勢觀察、中日兩國雖依然堅執原來地位、未有絲毫讓步、但至少有三要素、可使國聨大有解决遠東危機之希望、第一施肇基博士之演說、已將局部問題變成全世界問題、且與减縮軍備、國聨興替、及國際合作解决經濟恐慌諸大問題、有連帶關係、第二中日雙方俱未軼出原來要求範圍、第三白里安外交宿將、機智多才、輔以法國之實力出而主席、企圖挽救此國際合作與聨合保障和平之組織、必能有若干成就無疑、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據國聨中人消息靈通者稱、理事會現將用種種方法、使中日間滿洲危局得以友誼解决、倘至萬不得已時、則將被迫實施聨盟會章第十六欵、現望在數日内能商得一種協定、俾日軍可以撤回滿鐵附屬地、而中日間將可開始直接外交談判、若美國參加會議、則美代表除投票外、可享其餘一切權利、如此會中對於各項提議、便可獲知美國態度、免致將來議决後、有爲美國所不能接受者、據稱九月間理事會本擬派國際調查委員會、因探悉美國不甚贊成而罷、故此次理事會與美政府俱贊成有美代表列席、諒日政府當亦不能獨梗衆議、逕行拒絶也、至今日各理事非正式會議中、除此事外、其討論點係集中於昨日日代表芳澤宣言之解釋蓋此時日本堅持先與中國直接談判、然後撤兵、而中國則於日軍撤退以前、拒絶與日本談判、因此成爲僵局、故咸認形勢頗爲險惡、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據德人觀察、國聨理事會特别會第日、在求覓解决遼吉事件之最大努力上、似已弄僵、刻正移至幕後協商、恐在商得解决方法以前、或竟不幸不得不宣告無力調處以前、將不復再有公開會議、至就前述兩端而論、此間觀察時局者咸料將來終可得一解决辦法、而國聨中人亦仍希望根據白里安提議之方式、可使雙方妥協云、（十三日國民社電）</p>
<h3>白里安告中日兩方維持和平態度</h3>
<p>芳澤報告日政府意見施肇基根據事實反駁</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日下午理事會休會前、白里安演說警告中日兩國負有維持遠東和平之重大責任、並勸各自約束、勿生增重局勢之意外事件、白氏又撮述滿案局勢、略謂日本曾一再保證並無惡意、一俟確知日僑生命財産可得適宜保護後、即行撤回佔據中國境内之軍隊、中國亦曾宣稱無報復意、將約束人民勿有暴行、因此今次糾紛當不致有釀成巨禍之理由、設竟成爲巨禍、勢將發生非人力可抗之局勢、所以理事會今日必須盡其最高貴最重大之職責、而赴之以堅毅、日本與中國必須信任國聨、苟有國家不惜釀成巨禍、以致影響全世界必負可怖之重大責任、在目前危局中、仍有和平消釋誤會之可能、兩國外交關係猶未斷絶、尚能圍坐、桌討論此次糾紛之歷史、理事會將永不放棄其職任、就其可用之有限方法、努力盡其職責、按自九月三十日以來時局、未能進步之原因、據日方意見、由於中國有抗日運動與抵制日貨、以此日本不能撤兵、且在若干地方有日僑遷移出境之舉、反之、中國意見則謂國民政府已盡力設法、至少使在滿洲以外可免發生喪失生命情事、理事會希望中國將能維持此態度、須知雙方俱有力守鎭靜與緩和局勢之必要、再者中國曾向日本提議趕速撤回南滿鐵路附屬地外之日軍、但日本則堅持立開直接外交談判、最後美國已宣言完全擁護本會、此乃今日之局勢云云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中日兩國代表昨日作細目辯論之後、繼以白里安演說、謂中日代表彬彬有禮、至可欣喜遠東兩國能在行政院會議席上討論此種問題、足徵國聨會適於生存之能力、並稱日本旣再度否認其帝國主義的慾望、渠當堅請雙方停止一切舉動、靜待解决、此會議最可注意者、白里安以堅决口吻、宣言行政院當用所有各種方法、以盡其本身之義務、於以見國聨會必以全力防止中日衝突之擴大、此間對於美國之合作、甚爲注意、史汀生致國聨會之電、足爲接近之表示、但用何種方法取何種方式、可以使此接近實現、實爲此間考慮之點、須俟美國參加會議方、可謂之實現與否、此時尚難斷言、但所可斷言者、行政院中各國代表均思覓一方式、俾現有之同樣趨勢、變成一致行動、國聨會與美國之和平意志、一經成爲事實、則中日兩國之趨勢、必將爲所影響、而易於調處、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨行政會今日午後續開會議、聽取日總代表芳澤報告日政府關於滿洲時局之意見、開會時在三點三刻、空氣嚴瑼、較晨會爲甚、以實際言、時局似較前緊張、芳澤應議長白里安之召、向衆致詞、宣讀長文一通、說明滿洲之情勢、日本在滿洲之鉅大利益、中國之反日宣傳、中國散兵盜匪之種種行動、及在不靖區域内保護日僑之必要、末稱、俟日僑不復有危險時、日本即將其軍隊撤入鐵路區域之内、芳澤謂日本已兩次冒自己生存之險以挽回朝鮮與滿洲之迫切危害、日本以爲此兩區域與日本自己命運有密切之關係、日本在滿洲無土地野心、但有存亡所繫之政治與經濟上利益、各國在此廣大區區域内、有經濟活動、而日本乃其活動中平等機會與門户開放之保衞者、自日本到滿洲以來、對外貿易增多十倍、中國亦獲取此數省發展之大利、華人數十萬已移住滿洲、二十年來户口增倍、日本於犧牲如許人民如許金錢、奮鬥保障其自己安全後、應貢其大努力以發展滿洲、自無足異、發展中之第一要素、爲秩序之維持、日本以其堅定政策已阻止中國所有之内亂、使不擾及滿洲和平辛勤之事業、蓋日本在滿洲投資極鉅、計逾日金二十萬萬圓也、日本在滿洲之權利、近年來迭遭抨擊、自國民政府執權以來、雖負責之中國執政者、亦公然主張完全剗除日本在滿權利、中國當道對於南滿路局及對於日韓人民、尤抱挑釁態度、已有多時、華兵之殺害中村、即爲華人對日傲慢態度之一證、日本政府雖遇此挑釁行</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>爲、仍抱温和忍耐之態度、但政治空氣之緊張、與日本人民之憤懣、乃勢所不免之事云、芳澤繼復提出九月十八日南滿鐵路爲華人所攻擊之說、又謂日政府深望中國自覺時局嚴重、而知改變其從前態度、以合理建設的合作趨入新途徑、俾銷滅兩國間將來衝突之各種原因、日政府準備對中國直接談判、但至目前、尚未見此種願望之實現、行政會固亦有此願望渠意中國之所以遲遲不接受此議者、因中國内部政局甚爲混亂也云、芳澤繼又言南京政府與廣州政府間之和議、旋稱日軍總司令對於九月十八日南滿鐵路事所採行之計畫、乃以任何代價驅除迫切危險害及日本在滿洲地位之存在者之合法防衞步驟、日政府確欲於其國人安全保護獲取有效力之保障時、即撤兵至南滿鐵路區域之内、在發生對此難題謀一解决方法時、不可過於注重主義之考慮及理想之可能性、必須儘量顧及時局中實際的與政治的眞相、今中國全境仇日鼓噪甚烈、時局乃愈困難、故渠建議行政會應首先謀取兩國間成立協議、及在精神上解除軍備之方法、如中政府切實劣　力以制止中國境内反日運動、並會商日本擬定可恢復兩國尋常關係之、種先决的基礎辦法、則可使時局和緩、如人所欲、而銷除日軍撤回之最大阻礙、撤兵不繫於此種協定之實施、而繫於日僑之安全渠深盼中日間成立良好諒解云、中國總代表施博士答稱、日代表所提出之各點、多與本題無關、日代表所稱中國前外長近曾發表有敵意的言論一節、尤非事實至於抵制一層、任何國家之政府、不能强迫其人民購其所不欲購者、欲解决此事、唯在銷除其原因耳云、施博士繼宣讀南京來電兩通、謂日飛機在過去數日内、又以炸彈轟擊瀋陽以西之不設防城邑、施又舉出中國當道保護日韓人民之證、復宣讀在塲目覩之某重要美人聲明日軍無端攻擊瀋陽之報告、末稱、觀於現有情形、中日間直接談判、乃不可能事、故中國申請於國聨云、芳澤因英外相李定之建議、允向東京詢問施博士所提出日機又施攻擊事之詳情、議長白里安稱、行政會負有責任、不能不盡此責任、渠盼雙方各請其政府在未解决時勿增重時局、渠知兩大國皆了然於凡進一步釀成大禍者所須負之可怖責任云、行政會至此体會、今日中日雙方所表示之温和、已發生良好影響、英國某代表語人、今日會議、乃今後會議之甚好開端、路透訪員晤施博士、詢以東京所傳中政府如確知國聨不欲干涉、則準備與日本直接談判之消息、施博士稱、此說與渠所接之訓令適相反云、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）中國總代表施肇基通知理事會、中國將繼續盡力保護日僑生命財産、但鑒於日軍之侵略行爲、設因日政府繼續用武力爲國家政策之一端、而釀成不幸結果、日本當負全責、中國　信中日民族間缺乏諒解、乃日軍非法行動後不能免之結果、日本若能切實撤兵至滿鐵區域内、定能使兩民族間關係大有進步、而世界之和平、亦可由此保持、又瀋陽德總領事今日報告理事會、本月九日南滿鐵路區域而外、駐日軍、計瀋陽二千七百名、巨流河二百二十名、吉林千二百六十名、長春六百七十名、營口一百八十名、又昨日下午理事會中國施總代表宣讀基督敎育年會亞洲秘書美埃台博士本月十三日電、内稱、余目擊滿洲之佔領、此舉乃預先謀定詳細規劃、全出於日軍之侵略政策、中國方面未嘗有任何挑撥行爲、日軍迄今仍佔據南滿各形要地方、未嘗撤退、亞洲人士皆信今日乃國際聨盟試騐能力之時、世人須加注意日本此時亦如中國、正轉向赤化一途徑進趨、共産主義正在發展之中、倘國聨失敗、則世界之騷亂、將有蔓延之虞云云、（十四日國民社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>闢直接交涉</h3>
<p>當國聨行政會議九月三十日以前討論處置中日間此次嚴重事變之初日政府即一再宣稱。「滿洲事件爲中日間地方問題可由中日進行直接交涉解决。絶不容第三國置喙。」即國聨組織委員會調查實况亦所反對不幸國聨當時未洞燭其陰謀且未能排除萬難。本尊嚴之盟約執行其權威而爲日人之强横所屈伏。僅以希望並信任日本能於十月十四日以前撤退暴軍作敷衍之結論乃自九月三十日起截至最近日人不僅未履行其在國聨會議中接受撤退軍隊之决議之信諾抑且暴行有加無已國聨生政會爲此特再度召集。而日人要求直接交涉。不容許第三國置喙如故此種極荒謬無理之行徑。不能不嚴詞痛闢。</p>
<p>夫依照立國常軌兩國間發生若何足以障礙國交之事情自應以雙方直接用外交方式共謀解决爲正當方法。然而今日之情勢則不然第一日人於九月十八日之先不以正當之外交方式向我直接提出誠意之交涉。而突然對我暴力壓迫。不宣而戰則其外交早已脫軌其政治已早失常態不直接交涉於九月十八日之先。而要求直接交涉於暴力發動之後。此種矛盾横蠻一意孤行目無世界之主張。中國斷然不能承認。第二。日軍暴力發動以後。我國以毫不抵抗之態度。節節退讓而日軍肆其瘋狂之暴。行節節進逼。佔我都市。戮我軍民。没收我財産。更換。易旗幟。置官設臾所差者借爲尚未遞送正式宣戰之通牒耳。彼旣已實施武力發動。以敵國視我。兩國國交。已無形斷絶。我無端受此衂辱個人之所不能忍受者而謂一民族能伈伈俔俔。絶對順從日人之意志而任其擺佈。日要旣已自絶國交矣尚何直接交涉之可言。第三。盤踞於我領土以内之暴軍。今猶未撤。奉命開來我長江以及沿海各商埠之砲艦。正啣尾而來。襲炸我錦州之飛機時時予我以嚴重之威脅。所謂滿蒙獨立之運動。正甚囂塵上。在暴行有加無已之情勢之下。日人何曾絲毫有早日解决此嚴重問題之誠意其欲厲行大陸政策破壞和平。蹂躙國際協約之决心。日人自己已於九月三十日以後之暴行露骨說明。我國即欲直接交涉。又將從何處着手。四此次日軍之暴行。不僅爲簡單之中日兩國問題不僅足以迫害中國。抑且足以迫害世界予世界全人類以絶大之威脅。制止此種足以危害全人類之暴行。不僅中國應負此責世界各國。都應負此責。中國竭盡其力。認耐自持。對日軍之暴行。一再退讓。即所以對世界負責。對全人類負責。茲後如何防制此種暴行之繼續增加。如何使掀起禍機之罪人承負其應負之責任。應由世界各國共起圖之。中國實再無直接交涉之可能與必要。九日日本軍部三巨額會議。商洽撤兵問題其議决事項共有五項。第三項爲「俟新政權出現後。即作地方交涉。」第四項爲「俟至足保證日僑生命財産之新政權樹立後。即行撤兵。」證之是項决議則日人所謂直接交涉。並非以我國之中央政府或東北地方政府爲對手。而爲欲俟所謂滿蒙獨立成功。建立在其保。護下之新政權後再進行其爲所欲爲之滑稽交涉。我即欲直接交涉。除無條件承認東北爲日人之保護領土。更加訂若干辱國條約而外。日人豈其我允。豈能接受我國之談判。</p>
<p>基於上述五項之說明。中國今日絶不能接受直接受涉之主張。中國民族今日所抱持之態度爲舉國家與民族全置於國際協約尊嚴之基礎上。靜聽公理正義之裁判。如國際協約國放棄此責任而諉諸中國。則中國今後之行動。當不外兩途。一爲訂辱國之城下之盟。對日屈服。另一則爲舉全民族之熱血以與强權作最後之肉搏爭回公理正義以及我民族生存之自由。捨此兩途而外。更無他道。但中國人民敢切實聲言。具有四千年文明歷史之民族。有以國敝。决不能終始屈伏。對人豎立降幡。此而不能。則惟有靜候事態之自然發展。以毫不廻避之態度。大踏步走上第二條血路。</p>
<p>此爲中國人民目前之嚴整態度切盼國際協約切實認清。至於國内少數因循畏縮安於現狀之之輩。成不能理解當前之嚴重與前途之危難。而倡接受所謂直接交涉之主張。其結果將不使我國家於辱國喪權之外。更全部斷送立國之民族精神不止。國人其共起而唾其面嚴厲制止若輩之謬論。</p>

<h3>日本朝野視線集日内瓦</h3>
<p>冒天下之大不韙</p>
<p>力避第三者干涉</p>
<p>（東京）日本朝野對於滿洲事件之視線、今已移向日内瓦、現正嚴密留心國聨之討論、日本雖仍堅持與中國直接談判、而不受第三方面之干涉、但現亦漸知必須有一種動作、打破僵併之難關、難關維何、即日本方面堅主至少先開談判而後撤兵、如是可保證中國願意及力能擔任維持治安秩序、中國方面則堅主先撤兵而後開談判是也、日本反對國聨干涉之態度、雖未見温和、但此間密切觀察時事者皆以爲當可籌商一種辦法、使國聨能引中國與日本直接談判、而不使任何方面喪失顔面、又據東京消息靈通方面之意見、日政府今所不安者、即恐國聨輕信一方面之詞、不顧滿洲時局之眞相、憑理論的與理想的見解、横加干涉、日本時報今日對於此節、曾有評論、可以視爲日本觀察家之一般意見、該報謂國聨如加干涉、則必僅以近數日内日本軍人行動爲根據、而絶不注意日本在滿洲所受中國之種種痛苦云、（十四日路透社電）</p>

<h3>吉長日軍計畫永久屯駐</h3>
<p>天津通信、頃據吉林來人談稱、日軍自進佔吉垣、迄今已經半月、雖盛傳撤退消息、然觀近日趨勢、彼之手段反更嚴重、撤軍一說、恐非短時間所能實現、刻城外北上舊砲臺、東關團山子、以及自來水廠屋頂上、均架機槍大砲、瞄對城内、臨江及致和門外、開挖戰壕、步軍散伏、如臨大敵、本欲前往調查、奈日軍嚴禁華人駐足、稍一凝視、即有生命之憂、此舉日方曾先廣招土工、係使用拉夫手段、强迫工作者、每晚八時即宣告戒嚴、城區内外、滿布哨卡、遇華人經過、任意檢查、飛機來者漸稀、來輒盤旋一二小時始去、城内幸未擲彈、而人心仍屬恐慌、每日避遷外埠者甚多、自平吉通車發生阻碍後、所有旅客均取道吉長路、但該路現已完全入日人之手、票價原定現洋、由哈洋折合、近日則非現銀元或日幣不可、至駐吉日軍確數、因時去時來、甚難調查、且近日市街忽發現多數貧民及西裝者、旋悉此輩俱爲日探、内以韓人居多、民衆因畏其威、絶口不敢縱談時事、即所謂日軍警備部所出之布告、亦不敢撕毁、聞日前有因此被捕者、至今生死莫卜、</p>
<p>又日軍於入城之始、即將重要各機關佔領、自省政府受其逼勒改爲長官公署後、乃將公安局日軍門崗及日旗同時撤去、然仍派兵駐守其内、監視如故、至副司令官公署、現已改爲日軍警備司令部、又前陸軍訓練監舊址、改爲日本憲兵司令部、門首均高懸日旗、警備森嚴、僞長官熙洽出入、有日兵兩名護從、夾立汽車兩旁、無異重囚、外間謡傳哈埠張景惠已在哈組織省政府、嗣經調查不確、而省垣僞長官公署令行哈埠特區警察管理處及咨行特區長官公署之公文、昨均被退回、上批「吉垣並無此機關」七字、可見熙氏之政令、直已不出省垣矣、</p>
<p>又據長春來人言、日軍佔領吉長後、對外則僞稱撤兵、實際則早據爲己有、其所謂撤兵歸防、並無領土野心云者、乃欺騙歐美列强耳、長春南嶺大營、共有官兵房舍二百五六十間、上月十九日被日軍砲毁火燒後、殘存者不足三分之一、盡爲日軍所據、現屯兵三百餘名、機槍大砲、戒備林嚴、炸彈地雷、四面埋伏、日軍第二師團長多門以南嶺二道溝、地當長春咽喉、應駐重兵、以資防守、特於上月杪、電准關東軍總司令本莊、在南嶺添築營房、增兵屯扼、本月六七等日、已加派測量隊員、馳往南嶺、勘測營基、繪圖建築、嶺外埋竪標椿、上書「大日本軍用佔領地」、附嶺民地、輒被劃入營基界内、嶺街民户、已下令驅逐、限期搬家、聞其建築計劃、擬築一能容兩萬士兵之大本營、現將南嶺殘餘之頽垣破頂營房、一律拆撤、重新增築、本月四五兩日起、日軍并在頭道溝外孟家橋、二道溝鐵道南及南嶺大營前後、開始挖掘戰壕、每日督工六七百人、分在兩處掘築、另雇工人五六百名、在南嶺誓撤營房、雙方工作、期在速成、其戰壕計分三種、（一）交通壕、（二）防禦壕、（三）掩護壕、其建築營房、約分五種、（甲）師團部、（乙）旅團部、（丙）砲壘及瞭望臺、（丁）飛機塲、（戊）彈藥庫、除五項外、無綫電兵工廠、均擬附設南嶺大本營内、但不另掛招牌、有所忌避耳、查日軍近半月來、軍事上之準備、及其調兵進攻鐵嶺開原新民等處、種種軍事行動、並未停、且有加無已、佯言撤兵、將誰欺歟、</p>

<h3>日本滿蒙權益擁護秘密會議紀錄譯要（續九日）</h3>
<p>我國在滿蒙之特殊地位、雖得自日俄戰事、而許多旣得權、乃得自張作霖時代、彼張學良敢然脫離軍閥根性、而犧牲其特殊政權、奉還南京、以避其對我重大責任、此不僅高築砲壘以自衞、且放射外交的毒瓦斯於東亞全土、意於毒塞我日本之性命、···實爲空前之大傑作、如謂蔣介石奸雄可怕、則張學良對我政策之陰險、益爲可怕、帝國曩日曾···因歐美各强國對中國尚未感覺重要、又加海禁尚未全開、其民衆對華智識非常淺薄、故一方攻擊中國以夷制夷及遠交近攻之外交、一方却自學其法而反用之、於是世界各國、中我宣傳、而唱出對華國際協調查之原則、在此國際協調期中、······歐美各國、不啻爲帝國對華之便衣隊、······然今日海禁大開、歐美各國之生産、須求售於中國、因而發生親華之念、且近來中國人民、不論南北、非常覺醒、尤其是外交方策非常發達、其孜孜向歐美宣傳、每大膽不敵、而能訂正我國之中傷、因此歐美民衆對於中國之理解。乃加前數倍、······重以我國曩昔利用國際協調所剝取於中國者、事後大惹各國之猜忌、·········故狡猾之美國、乘華盛頓會議之機、一舉而衝破我國在滿蒙之特權、且以九國協約束縛我之行動、繼復以英美合作力理、打倒在華國際協調外交之慣例、欲帝國陷於孤立、······又奉派之外交、雖仍以遠交近攻及以夷制夷爲對我之基幹、無如滿蒙利源豐富、歐美虎視耽耽、任我日本呌穿奉派之術策、然利之所在、彼等必樂而趨就、况英美今日合作其精神乃欲掃滅帝國在華之勢力、彼奉派之外交術、正投合其野望、·········吾人須信英美資本帝國主義、確有與奉派提携到底之可能、夫如是·······英美二國、竟成奉派之便衣隊、共運用以夷制夷之外交術以制我、而彼乃可坐享中中國遠交近攻政策之優待焉、</p>
<p>余在任地、與林總領事及關東長官司令官等研究至再、發現下列諸外交策略、畢竟須連續的運用、方足以保留我滿蒙政策之根幹、而不被推倒、（一）以華制華、利用其内部感情、或反對派、及馬賊團等、以攪亂其政權、藉以牽制其對我之外交、且能使歐美各　國對滿蒙投資、發生危懼之念、（二）恩中威、凡各事業之進行、一面予以利益、一面即藉此行使威權、（三）親中惡、精神的方面、則以親善及平等爲表面上之原則、裏面則行使另傷及破壞策略、（四）對現有懸案及未實現之旣得權、以日華共存共榮成合辦性質、爲表面上之解决方針、其實仍以取得特權並保留之爲要素、（五）滿蒙外交權、仍以張學良爲担當長官、</p>
<p>奉派鐵道網之東西二大幹線中、東線之奉海路、旣已通至吉林、帝國對此、恐難阻其實現、故無妨做一順水人情、但勸其許我建設吉會路、我不惜另以天圖路全部無償讓與之、蓋滿蒙特産及富源之集散地、東部雖有相當之多額、然以視西部之黑龍江及蒙古方面、其地味之肥沃、面積之廣大。均瞠乎後之、且西部交通之發達、可使胡蘆島因而繁盛、故西線之完成、實爲我滿蒙政策之致命傷、···········今幸通遼洮南間尚未築、帝國必須乘此時機以阻之、並及洮南開魯間之缐、倘張學良許我、則帝國可中止興築大賚路、以爲交換條件、······更乘此機會、高唱共存共榮之假精神、誘其與我協定鐵道運費、及貨客吸收區域、倘不然者、帝國之南滿路、以准許中國投資合併爲題而誘之、張學良必入彀中、彼如仍以外交權旣歸併南京爲口實、而拒絶交涉、帝國則以旣得權皆得自張作霖時代、且所在地乃彼之管轄等等理由、勸其發揮人格、代帝國居中與南京交涉、吾人深信張學良必無所逃其責、免帝國直接與南京交涉、而造成滿蒙外交歸併南京之慣、</p>
<p>帝國在滿蒙之特殊地位、乃因東北長官有特殊的政權而確保之、請稽張作霖未入關時代、自可瞭然、及張作霖入關而後、帝國地位因之動摇、幸當時張作霖之野心、專欲統一中原、對我滿蒙之特殊權益、不敢有何等露骨行動、然帝國至此、益感滿蒙之地位、必須早日確定、蓋中國之統一如果實現、我之地位、必然被其蹴倒、加之革命勢力日盛、英美監視益嚴、帝國之危機、間不容髮、當時田中外相、乃商諸關係官廳、乘革命軍北伐機會、利用以華制華策略、炸害張作霖、欲復辟派奪取滿蒙、繼見形勢不利、轉而勸告張學良獨立者、無非欲確保帝國在滿蒙之地位、南滿路業務之不振如今日者、雖可謂已達極點、然如按其收入額哩數而比例之、恐我國内地任何良好成績之鐵道、不能駕而上之。蓋論其長不過七八百哩、其過去數年之平均收入、實爲我交通史上聞所未聞見所未見之暴利。······本年（指民國十九年）以來、因世界經濟之變動、加以中國銀價之低落、······南滿鐵路營業、因受非常之惡影響、當局者費盡苦心、排除萬難、以吸收各地特産、或以車馬爲集貨之中繼、或减收港灣費飲水費等、或以銀行機關供給低利金融與各特産貿易商、或暗中减收運費、或以直接活動之國際運輸公司、不管利益若何。到處增設倉庫、减收其租金、並與貨主以種種便利等等、於此足證滿鐵當局對於增加收入、實可謂慘淡經營、惡戰苦鬥、無如世界的不景氣之大自然、不無許人力挽回之、······一般人遂誤解滿鐵當局爲無能、致令其黄金的繁榮、被奉派鐵道網包圍政策所打破云云者、乃其毫無國際的理解、及不曉世界的不景氣之慘狀而發之謬論、······蓋世人每以黄金滿鐵時代之收入爲標準、殊不知······世界的不景氣、正亦黄金時代之反映耳、如果滿鐵因受包圍而减收者、則包圍滿鐵之諸路、如瀋海吉海吉長吉敦四洮洮昂齊克呼海打通等、何以比我滿鐵之减收、猶慘過數倍、今彼方從業員薪金且已滯發數月、故滿鐵之經濟、視此尚有非常餘裕。毫不因减收而基礎動摇也、</p>
<p>撫順煤者。其事實爲諸君所共曉、該礦係中國所有、帝國唯取其收益及開採之權、惟我國一時旣不能出許多、而中國方面亦不能多售、苦無機會可一時掘完以增帝國之富耳、該礦之埋藏煤量、共有十七億噸、公然發表者爲十三億噸、滿鐵努力採掘二十餘年、共掘出四億七千萬噸、公表者爲三億三千萬噸、按其所存之額非常豐富、滿鐵雖欲極力開掘、無如世界經濟不况而後、販路大受影響。、按僅鐵道减收、自四月至十一月爲二千八十五萬五千圓）</p>
<p>滿鐵特派調查員四十名、前赴奉派各鐵道沿線、調查其收入狀况、驚知奉派鐵道經濟、無不極度窮迫、此皆因奉派交通當局無國際的經濟眼光、徒濫用官權、播弄其金融政策、與我滿鐵挑戰、是亦應得之天罰也、至於以不換紙幣强向人民收買各特産以博巨利、······徒使人民極度疲敝、而毫不顧惜、······其無持久力明矣、我如能稍忍而姑待之、其鐵道網之勢力、可以不攻自破、夫如是奉派之鐵道猛進、其打擊我南滿路之重點、不在今日而在將來、即東西幹線完成之日是也、東三省鹽務總局之食鹽、依明治四十一年七月二十八日條約、此官鹽之運輸、我南滿路有其特權、又附則第四條、如欲廢棄本條約者、須於三個月前通知南滿路、然中國方面事前竟不通知、······而悉數交其鐵道網運輸、······滿鐵因此損失莫大之收入、且我國每向各國宣傳、滿蒙華民如非賴我滿鐵交通之便其生活與文化、無不受脅迫云云、亦因此官鹽運輸之被奪、言之不復成理、遂能使我滿鐵消息其爲兩國共存共榮之交通、而傾爲帝國主義之交通、······是故當局對此權利、頗欲奪回、······雖恐其惹起中國國民之反感、荏苒而未敢實行然無日不伺候機會、必使此名譽的假面具、珠還合浦而後止。縱運費减至低於奉派鐵道、滿鐵亦樂爲之、必不得已、犧牲其一部份、亦所不惜、······此問題或因鐵道交涉而能解决、則幸甚矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>抗日救國與成人敎育</h3>
<p>吳增芥</p>
<p>在暴日侵佔我國土地舉國憤慨的時候、提出成人敎育的問題、似乎太迂遠了、其實、從這次嚴重危急的事件、我們的確受着一個强烈的刺激、呌我們對於一成人敎育」、不但注意而已、還須下一决心、切切實實的幹一下、我此次因參與宣傳工作、對於成人敎育發生許多感想、特地發表出來、供敎育界同志們的討論、</p>
<p>大家都已知道世界先進國家、没有一個不是注重敎育的建設的、普及敎育、都已實現、我們的仇敵日本、據文部省最近的統計報告、全國受敎育與未受敎育的百分比是九九·五、就是說、一百個人之中、祇有半個人不識字、他們國内銷路最廣的報紙、每天銷去一百二十多萬份、從這個事實、可以證明識字人數之多、我國識字人數、僅百分之二十、和他們比較起來、眞有宵壤之别成人敎育與民衆運動、有密切的關係、因爲民衆運動、必須有相當的訓練、而訓練的方式、就是敎育、中國是四萬萬同胞的中國、現在國難臨頭、民衆奔走呼號者、原祇有少數知識分子、大多數人、還是糊裏糊塗、我前大率傾一部分學生到蘇州婁門城外附廓地方去演講和化裝表演、聽衆大多是鄉民、演講的人、說得精疲力盡、而聽衆仍是不懂、你和他、講「中國」「日本」「瀋陽」「萬寳山」、他們腦子裏一些印象也没有、他們只知道他的村莊、他的父母、兄弟姊妹、親戚、不知道什麽呌「國、」也不知道什麽呌「中國、」更不知道什麽是「日本」了、我曾經問一個婦人道、「你是那裏人、」她道、「我是婁門人、」我再問、「你曉得你是蘇州人麽、」她摇頭說、「不曉得、」你想她連自己是蘇州人都不知道、那裡會知道是中國人呢、這次演講　、雖極力使言辭簡單通俗終究不能引起聽衆的反應、</p>
<p>我們要國民運用民權、參與政治、必須先使國民對於政治發生興趣、要他們對於政治發生興趣、必須使他們留意時事、所以一般民衆、至少限度、要能夠看報、知道國内的情形、而後忠難來到、才能一致奮起、在政府領導之下、參與民衆運動要國民一致奮起、參與民衆運動必須實施成人敎育、其辦法可列爲左項各端、</p>
<p>（一）國家制定强迫成人敎育法會、凡年長失學的成人、都要進民衆學校、如有違抗的、嚴予懲罰、（二）各城市小學、鄉村小學、都開設成人班、附近居民、可就近入學、</p>
<p>（三）各社敎機關、如農民敎育館、民衆敎育館、受十級機關的命令、負責指導成人敎育專業之進行、</p>
<p>（四）每日上課至少二小時、於務業完畢後獲暇時受課、</p>
<p>成人敎育是刻不容緩的事情、現在有許多小學、已附設民衆夜校、敎師也曾努力勸導成人入學、但是事實上進學校的人很少、今天高興就來明天不高興就不來、往往開始時還算熱閙、到後來便精神渙散、萎靡不振、尤其是婦女們、簡直視入校讀書爲可恥、無論你怎樣宣傳、給予優待、她們總是裹足不前、試問這種情形、成人敎育、那裡會有功效、所以據個人的意見、要希望民衆注童國事、擔負國家重任、非施行成人敎育不可、而這種敎育、必須帶有强迫性、除年老殘廢、以及有精神病的以外、其餘不識字的人、一律須進民衆學校、</p>
<p>與成人敎育性質相似的、是歐美諸國盛行的補習敎育、他的用意、是要使一般人在業餘之暇、獲得知識技能、以補職業之不足、而受進一步的訓練、我國目前最迫切的、是强迫的成人敎育、第一步先使年長失學的人、能夥識字看報、等敎育普及之後再實行補習敎育、</p>
<p>與成人敎育同樣重要的、要算義務敎育了、但是我覺得依目前情况而論、成人敎育的重要還在義務敎育之上因爲兒童是將來的主人、成人是現在國家的主人、我們對於現在的主人翁、如果不使他受敎育、荳不是很危險、</p>
<p>國人對於日本帝國主義羣起反抗、這實在是團結精神的表現、但是我們不能把大多數失學無知的同胞置諸腦後應該使他們受到相當的敎育、然後一呼百應、共赴國難救國的辦法當然不祇敎育一項、而成人敎育的確是當今的要圖、願敎育行政機關和敎界同志共同努力、（在蘇女中）</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。這兩天我們幾乎都迸住了呼吸。在靜候國際聨盟的好消息。人人的心目中。簡直是將國際聨盟瞧作我們的救命王菩薩消災延壽。救苦救難。全仗着菩薩的威靈與慈悲。但是我們希望儘管希望。却不可過於的信賴菩薩要知菩薩有時也會怕惡鬼作怪。而不能保佑我們的。所以我們在希望之中。還須盡力作一切的準備國内的和平統一。急不容緩。而最後的奮鬭。也决不是貼貼標語開開會議就算完事。非得信中全國的實力。向死路中求生路不可。</p>

<h3>聽拳</h3>
<p>西洋人打架，我看過一次，聽過一次，是有特别的風趣。一九一四年秋天，正在日本攻青島的時候，我的船離横濱向檀香山開去，忽然聽得吸烟間裏，乒乒乓乓······不知閙了什麽事，待我走到門口一看，只見兩個西洋人，我一腿，在那兒打架。我那時覺得最奇怪的是他們倆不做聲不做氣的一句話也不說。因爲我那時以前所看過煌只是我們家鄉人的相打，打之前，打之後都有喊聲，駡聲，挑戰聲，詛咒聲。現在看了西洋人的啞吧對打，眞是見所未見，簡直把我這個鄉瓜老都望獃了。我起初以爲他們是打得好玩，可是他們打得那樣使勁，那樣認眞，那樣拚命，决不是玩藝兒。停一忽兒，有一個不回手了，那一個也停止攻擊，這種不講而和也不多見。兩年後，我去拜訪一位美國同學，聽見他屋裏乒乒乓乓的響，我站住靜聽，的確是乒乒乓乓和我在海船上所聽見的聲音一樣丨拳頭打在肉上的反響。我立刻使勁敲門，裏面聽見敲門聲似乎立刻進了戰，因爲鼕鼕之門没有乒乓了。我的朋友開門和我招呼拉手的時候，臉上憤色一閃，便是滿面春風了，他的夫人聽說是我來了也到客廳裏來相見，伊一切如常，只是頭髮凌亂一點。我的朋友這天是大逆不道，因爲在美國打老婆是很不體面的一件事。我所詫異的是我們家鄉人歡喜在人面前打老婆，而西洋人見了人來便亭手，老婆被打也不喊救命。好，我寫這段故事没有别的奢望，我的小小志願是：</p>
<p>「兩耳已將清水洗，</p>
<p>從今愛聽拳頭聲。</p>
<p>哈！先生錯了。聽拳何如</p>
<p>打拳，打拳何如用拳打！」</p>
<h3>自殺非救國</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>日前見本報載康寳森取駁壳槍。自向其頭部開放。至腦血并流而本埠漢口路新關碼頭第一號渡船。乘客中亦有一中年男子。突然縱身投浦自沈。與波臣爲伍、康則遺下便條三張。（一）爲痛國家將亡。勸國人努力自救。（二）爲死後所遺衣物。命人變賣。悉數充作抗日救國基金。（三）爲寫明家屬通訊地址。蓋純係日軍此次侵襲東北。受劇烈之刺激而自殺者。一號渡船之乘客。雖不知其姓氏。而亦留下報紙一份。暴日侵略警報一張。信一封。上書請通知閘北寳山路祥順里十三號趙雲燦等字樣。遺書中有刻下國難臨頭。我自身無救國能力。枉爲國民云云。蓋亦憤激而自殺者。亦可悲己。</p>
<p>雖然。自殺豈今日熱心救國者所可出耶。夫見國事之連年失敗。誰不恫心。前二十年有飲刃滔海者矣。而無補於國勢之凌夷不振。輕則有斷指絶粒嘔血者矣。聞者未始不慷慨奮起。劍及屨及。乃未幾而瀅、忘之。何也。此皆一時之虛憍。而死者正死。生者時過境遷。而不復有繼續性隨其後。究之生者固不能對死者於地下。而死者終亦何益於國家之前途。而可以瞑目乎。吾非不知自殺者。有血性。有思想者也。須知天旣賦以血性思想。則其爲人也　。較之庸庸者流。自必有異。所謂死有重於泰山。輕於鴻毛者。辨之有素。故誓一夫之死。以易萬衆之生。自殺可也捐一人之生。而聽萬衆之死。自殺不可也。昧乎此界說。是吾國民之生命。今日　鄰猶未絶我。而吾先絶之矣。今日多一自殺之人。即後日少一支搘危亡之一柱石。敵人之所以懼我畏我者。懼吾中國之尚有人。非懼我之能自殺以至於盡也。苟有此身。一息尚存。則國可保。仇可復。上者如武侯之鞠躬盡瘁。不伐魏則不休。次則如豫讓之漆身吞炭。不報警則不已。否則自殺眞爲暴日所拍手而竊笑。吾不知果何取焉。</p>
<p>昔日人之滅朝鮮。初閔爲大臣。聞變自殺。繼則各大臣亦隨之而自殺。其卒也無損於日。而亦無濟於韓。是自殺爲不顧國家之生命。而徒喪一己之生命而己。若早知自殺之無意義。茹荼飲蓼。臥薪嘗膽。昔賢有詔我者矣。苟求得一當以報。則雖竭我毛髮。以供國家之犧牲。與我國仇以同盡。亦何待躊躇。此則不可不知。吾不肯爲愛惜生命者張目。而悲自殺者之虛擲生命。故著此篇以正之。不然。畏首畏尾者。逃死苟活之不暇。又爲康寳森渡船乘客之罪人。而非我所齒及已。</p>
<h3>英雄與領袖</h3>
<p>— 湯成辛</p>
<p>外禍日逼。蓋非無故。乃鑒於我國内亂頻仍。民貧國疲。遂大動食指。頓萌覬觎之念。而一考我國廿年來内亂之由來。蓋皆緣於所謂大人物者之英雄夢與領袖慾太甚之故。於是稍有才智之士。無不欲騁其才智。以睥睨當世。復有若干投機者流。爲之推波助瀾。益張其焰。曰此英雄之志也。此領袖之所當爲也。不知英雄與領袖日增。而國事則因之日非。國家之元氣斵喪。生靈塗炭。無非供若輩自命爲英雄與領袖者之無謂犧牲。噫。是烏可耶。夫國家不患人民之熱中英雄與領袖也。而患在熱中英雄與領袖之徒。羣以政治舞臺爲其唯一目的。而不肯致其才智於科學或實業之途。於是日事相殘。國計民生。於焉日蹙。國家將陷於萬刦不復之地此英儒羅素所以有「占有慾不必有而創造慾不可無」之論也。彼歐美之科學家與實業家。儘多受人崇拜。且皆留名史冊舉世景仰。噫。我國之英雄與領袖乎。何圖此而不圖彼耶</p>
<h3>國難詩話</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>自日軍侵我邊彊。殺我同胞。慘暴蠻横。曠古未有。愛國青年。或則請纓赴難。或則奔走呼號。而一般憂時之士。荷戈有志。效命無從。乃發爲詩歌。以鼓勵國人。其中不乏慷慨激越之章。有足警世也者。摭拾一二。綴爲詩話。亦可見國難聲中民氣之一斑</p>
<p>途友李乾麟。畢業於杭州警官學校。曩在杭時。與余唱和甚相得。少年豪氣。不减元龍。所作詩文。頗多可誦。此次憤倭人入寇。君作感懐十絶。茲錄其四云。「楚雖三户足亡秦。嘗胆應敎更臥薪。極目中原歎沉陸。聞鷄起舞豈無人。」「鬩牆何事苦持爭。城下恥聞續舊盟。袞袞廟堂空食肉、問誰借箸退蠻兵。」「鶴唳遼東涙滿襦。將軍枉自戴頭顱。魯陽可有回戈力。還</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（一三）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>唐軍門夫人舉行一種大規模的接見門生禮，表示伊的生平第一快心事；宅門以内直到女廳都是洞洞的開放着，地上鋪着很厚的氇，兩旁侍立着花團錦簇的侍婢，自庭下直達堂上，約摸有三五十人。鶯鶯燕燕的口中傳呼着新科解元陶遲進見，陶遲便在這傳呼聲中低着頭兒上堂，早有兩名侍婢在居中鋪着一方紅氍毹，陶遲便恭恭敬敬的行那拜見座師的禮。</p>
<p>唐夫人起立，受了兩拜，便請這位新貴門生坐在一旁，侍女早獻上一道奶茶，一盤細點；唐夫人略詢家世，陶遲很恭敬的對答。偶爾舉目，却見盛妝華服的唐夫人後面，有一位千嬌百媚的女郎在揭起着繡帘偷觑；陶遲目光偶注，繡帘便飄然的放下了，這便是他曾經在娘娘廟中一度見面的唐秀英小姐。</p>
<p>陶遲拜女座師的佳話丨這是十八世紀的佳話，喧傳了一時；博得有人送他一首調笑的詩。</p>
<p>丨丨戲陶遲丨丨</p>
<p>五千科舉竟無名，四望求援絶救兵；窮措誤攀官婦轎，武衙直達考文棚；豈知榜上頭名客，便是輿前目送卿；年少解元誰及汝？珠簾錦帳拜門生。</p>
<p>拜女座師，是佳話；拜女座師而博得這一首調笑的詩，益發是佳話中的佳話。誰料當時的佳話，猶不止此丨</p>
<p>「令郎少年英俊，前程未可限量，軍門大人很有無窮的希望；要是，來年聨捷，名登鼎甲，那麽令郎穩穩可以做那軍門大人的乘龍快婿。」這是濟南太守傳請陶貢生入署相見時候的密談。</p>
<p>「爾小子，勉之哉！今天太守傳見，如是云；你果然得中了鼎甲，山東提督便是你的丈人峯了；書中自有黄金屋，書中自有千鍾粟，書中自有顔如玉。」這是陶貢生訓子的話。</p>

<h3>國難聲中厘拆狂騰</h3>
<p>市場概况　自外侮發生以還、金融界市况初尚相安無事、旋因各處商事前途、發生抵制風潮遂致百業蕭條、而金融形勢日見緊張、目前時局益趨嚴重、而銀洋市况更復加甚、於是外埠購運現欵紛沓而至滬埠供應見肘、結果釐拆一致狂抬超出尋常市况之上矣、</p>
<p>釐拆價格　「洋釐」昨市釐價形勢較前略覺平和、早市爲七錢二分七釐半、較前日午市似又小去七毫半、惟午市依舊上騰與前午相埒、爲七錢二分八釐二毫半「銀拆」早市及午市同爲三錢五分、較前晨小去五分、銀行持牌一錢四分、劃頭加水一錢五六分至錢七八分、</p>

<h3>大批長期到期訊</h3>

<p>昨（十四日）華商證券交易所各債券市况、期貨十一月期仍無交易、十月期亦續沉靜、現貨做開種類仍多、至各債價之變動情形、因日人雖對我仍極兇横、增兵遣艦、而觀國際情况、對於東方情形、已稍瞭解、國際與論、咸同情於我、外交形勢、較前有利國聨如不能解决、美即有九國會議之訊、彼時如日人仍悍然不顧公理裁判則我理直氣壯、出於一戰、列强必不致袖手、不以武力干涉、故統觀目下内外形勢、雖嚴重益甚、而環象則較前爲佳且粤方誠意合作、統一已無問題、久無生氣的市場人心、至是乃頓有轉機、遂令賣方形勢觀望、不敢任意售出、買方大户雖未有鉅額成交、零星收進則頗不寂寞、各債價以求過於供、在晨初開出時即一致回漲、以後仍見步步趨堅、上漲益勁、結果較前如二○捲漲達三元六角、二○關統稅一九善各漲三元三四角、餘好二元六七角、整六關稅亦漲一元六七角、蓋均回漲頗巨也、特觀今後證券市之趨勢、將仍視外交形勢之推移而定云、計全日現貨成交二萬一千元、期貨上午四百八十餘萬、後市約三百六十萬合計八百四十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>救濟公債跌價之辦法孫羣</h3>
<p>（一）此次公債跌價損失之總額　查國民政府新發行之債劵、計有二十二種、除江海關二五庫劵　津海關二五庫劵、業已本息清償外、其本息尚未還清者、共有二十種、舊政府之公債、由國民政府承認抽籖償還本息者、有七長整六整七三種、承認付息者、有春節庫劵一種合計新舊二十四種、按照本年十月份計算、未還本之總額、爲七萬六千五百三十八萬八千元、列表如左、</p>

<p>海河公債　四○○萬元　三○○萬元　共計　九八五九九萬元　七六五三八萬八千元</p>
<p>續二　五　四○○○萬元　一九○○萬元</p>
<p>查十月十三日市價、廿關統稅鹽稅、已一齊下跌至四十五左右、裁兵亦已迫近五十元、以各債平均價格而論、實已下跌至五五折、按照七萬六千五百三十八萬八千元之原額、已共損失三萬四千四百四十一萬四千六百元、此次公債之暴落無異金融界之大地震、設不速起救濟、前途危險、不堪設想矣、茲特擬具救濟辦法、希銀行界與財政部、特加注意焉、</p>
<p>（二）銀行界救濟公債跌價應採之辦法目下上海銀行界、對於公債之跌價、尚無具體救濟之辦法、此行購買數百萬、冀提高價格、而彼行則乘高價抛出、以圖减輕本行之危險、故維持之結果、常等於零、蓋其原因、皆欲維本行之穩固、而不知維持全部銀行之穩固也、要知時至今日、一銀行之孤立政策、斷不能自存、必以協作之精神、謀同舟之共濟、方能起死回生、以救金融之急難、茲宜在日軍未撤政局未定以前、採取買賣合作之辦法由上海銀行公會、尅日召集會議、商訂一買賣債劵之公約、凡下列各點、均宜訂入</p>
<p>（一）各銀行爲維持金融界之基礎、不使根本動摇起見、應本同舟共濟的精神、協同分擔責任、維持債劵市價至六折以上、</p>
<p>（二）債劵跌至六折以下時、各銀行應按資本及定期存欵之總額、分配擔任購買債劵之成數、</p>
<p>（三）各銀行應按照分配購買之成數限十月二十日以前、籌繳保證金於銀行公會、</p>
<p>（四）銀行公會收到此項保證金後、即代表各銀行開始購買、至市價回漲至六折、暫行中止、</p>
<p>（五）買進之行市、應以均價分配於各銀行、不得以賣進之行後、分别價高價低、由各銀行自擇、藉照公允、</p>
<p>（六）凡買進之債劵、到月底須竭力收現、暫不賣出、以維市價、</p>
<p>（七）各銀行已購存之現貨、及保證準備之債劵、在公約未取消以前、不問價格回漲至何程度、一律暫禁賣出、</p>
<p>（八）各銀行如有必不得已之理由、而須賣出者、須具理由書於銀行公會、得其核准給予賣出證、方許賣出、</p>
<p>（九）各銀行購存之期貨、在六折以下時、不准賣出、</p>
<p>（十）各銀號錢莊及未加入公會會員之銀行、由銀行公會發起開一聨高會議、商同顧全大局、一律遵守公約、共圖維持、</p>
<p>（十一）平津漢口各銀行、由上海銀行公會將此公約分電通知、請其尅日開會、限期實行、</p>
<p>（十二）此項公約、在政局未定、日軍未撤以前、暫行有效、</p>
<p>（十三）散户在六折以上賣出者、當然聽其自由其在六折以下賣出者、應否令其出具理由書、送證劵交易所監理員核定、再准賣出、由銀行公會協議决定、</p>
<p>（十四）證劵交易所、應將各種債劵六折之價格、榜　示於交易所、一面並取消每萬八百元之交割準備金、以增購買者之便利、</p>
<p>此項公約係一種臨時緊急救濟的辦法、雖帶有限制性質、而爲合作維持其市價實不得不然、倘經銀行公會議决公佈、則以低價抛出者、自不願虧蝕鉅本、從此放手、旣如公同維持、自當竭力補進、我恐債價在五天以内即可飛漲至六折以上、若銀行公會乘機追進、則本月交割期前、令其回漲至七折左右、甚易事也、</p>
<p>（三）財政部救濟公債跌價應採之辦法　查公債之漲落、雖關係於社會經濟力、而與人民信仰心、關係彌鉅、能安慰人民之信仰心、而不使生疑慮之念、恐怖之情者、惟在擔保甚金之穩固可恃、及每月本息之如期清償而已、欲達到此目的、財政部應速採取下列之手段、</p>
<p>（一）對於指定債劵之基金、應請明令公佈、竭力保障、遇任何國家緊急用途、絶對不准提用、並由立法院製定提用國債基金之嚴厲的懲戒法、以昭國信、</p>
<p>（二）凡已指定基金之某種稅收、遇天災人禍、因而不敷撥足償還到期之本息時、得由保管委員會請求財政部、在他種稅收項下於每月二十五日以前、照數撥足倘有拒絶行爲、以妨害債信論、得請監察院提出彈劾、實行懲戒、</p>
<p>（三）凡遇指定之某種稅收、不敷撥足償還應到期之本息時、得由保管委員會推舉收稅視察員、實地調查稅收之眞相、如證明以後實在不敷時、可請求財政部另行指定基金、於兩星期内答覆公佈、</p>
<p>（四）上述保障基金之辦法、應請立法院修正公債法及基金保管委員會條例、嚴密規定於其中、總期由人的保障、進而爲法的保障、使公債基金、不隨政局之變動財長之更迭而動摇、</p>
<p>（五）爲協助基金保管委員會之行使聨權起見、可另組基金監察委員會凡購買公債在五百萬元以上、受押公債在一千萬元以上者、不論銀行及個人、均得推舉委員一人、以監察基金之是否穩固、且因此明瞭基金之眞相、自可以杜絶市場之謡言、减少大户之抛空、</p>
<p>（六）延期還本之謬論、須嚴重取締、以是項謬論、足以破壞國信、擾亂金融也、如有以延期還本之說進者、應嚴厲闢除、並請監察院提出彈劾、</p>
<p>其餘尚有數點、如果實行、亦於債市有益、條舉如左、</p>
<p>（七）預告整六整七抽籖日期以增債信查整六整、七、爲舊政府整理案内之公債、今未抽籖還三者、已達兩年、問其原因、以值百抽五之關餘、因金價高漲、除還外債外、尚無盈餘、是以抽籖無期、然外債滿期剩餘之基金亦係關餘之一種、如能預算撥足基金之年月、將抽籖日期、預先公佈、亦可鼓舞債市人心、促起債價回漲、</p>
<p>（八）宣布賑災公債於發行第一年内决不在市場開拍因賑災係慈善性質、所發行之賑災公債、應分派各省市、向全國富户及大慈善家、誠懇勸募、各界購買時、應照章九八繳欵、期災民得受八千萬元之實惠、不得照向例在市場折價出售、並宣布一年以内、不在交易所開拍、則市場籌碼、不至騾增、債價自可回漲、</p>
<p>（九）交易所停拍辦法應令改正交易所向例每天漲跌四元即行停拍、收齊追金、再行開做、但停拍係表示漲跌逾四元之價格當天不得再做、至停拍以後、倘仍有四元範圍以内之交易、自應照常開做、以免投機家之操縱、設不如此改正、恐以後利用出售一萬損失四百元之行市、可以隨時使其停拍、以阻止公衆之交易也此於債市暴落、關係彌鉅、應速令交易所尅日改正、</p>
<p>（十）凡債市價格跌至五折時應令交易所即行停拍查各國證劵跌價、有令交易所停止交易、以鎭風潮者、我國不令交易所停止開市、而令在五折以下之價格、停止開拍、比較各國之辦法、似爲通融、且此法一行、則價格跌至五折、大可放心購買、因跌已不能再跌也、惟停拍後而有五折以上之交易、仍須照常開做、使買賣者留有廻翔之餘地、此種辦法、於救濟濟茫無限止的跌價、實有極大的效果、</p>

<p>昨洋米市况、本街進胃甚佳、北洋帮胃口亦濃、奈因裝船及運儎等尚有問題、故祇托本街行號代爲收進、尚未直接購買裝運也、但市面已被軋漲、洋行方面因産價報大亦不出售、結果現小絞跳漲二三角、期小絞漲一錢至一錢五六分不等、統市成交現米小絞敏當西貢等二千多包、期小絞回籠貨一千二百噸、三月份小絞價至五兩三錢半、近期五兩二錢、現小絞喊至十一元以上、高西貢至十二元四五角、中次各檔一律跟漲</p>
<h3>標粉午後廠出又盛</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋麥報價爲二角左右、一部之内地帮、自聞國際形勢之嚴重、頗有趁勢吸進、本月份因實銷平常、尚未大動、遠期較前日又好近分、迨至下午開盤、以廠家仍陸續出檔、目中日之國交、究尚未破裂、洋麥之來源、尚無危險、致人心復軟、紛紛出檔較上午之最高價計回跌三分之議觀後步之升沉當看國際之風雲如何也結果本月份較前日回跌二分二厘半、十一月份跌二分十二月份跌一分七厘半、一二月份跌一分七厘半、三月份跌一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥重落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋麥報價旣好、前日之暴漲風聲、旣因中日之惡化、遂引起人心之熱奮、内地帮趁此機會、又大事收進、所以各月份開價、又較前日漲三四五分不等、迨至下午開盤、因國際之形勢、又轉和緩、買方之氣態、已呈停寂、而空方則又活躍、致各月份開價、又步步回跌、勢亦甚烈、結果本月份較前日反跌二分、十一十二月份跌四分、一月份跌五分、二月份跌一分、三月份跌二分云、</p>
<p>五金　日貨五金紛紛封存</p>
<p>日貨五金、其在本埠者有紫黄銅皮·紫黄銅絲·六尺七尺東白鐵·六尺七尺瓦楞鐵·十號至二十號新鉛絲·六分至六寸洋釘·黑龍牌船牌等水門汀、以及煤鍫鋼精火酒等不下百餘種最近暴日横行益甚、故各公會抵制工作愈烈、因此入會會員壛各自爲政相繼紛紛封存、故調查封存之金屬品已有四五千担之多、然各會員尚努力調查、恐在後之封存貨、尚不至此數也、</p>

<h3>財部决維持公債</h3>
<p>財次張壽鏞之談話</p>
<p>同五迄今外債已償十餘萬萬</p>
<p>至民國廿九年外債即可還清</p>
<p>財部維持公債已有兩項辦法</p>
<p>一經討論確定即可正式實行</p>
<p>華東社云、關於停付外債之不確維持公債之必要、財部長宋子文氏、業已正式表示、昨財部次長張壽鏞氏、復向華東社記者、正式聲明、財部絶對無停付外債之舉動、而於維持公債、已有確切辦法、再經一度商討、其事即可實行、據張氏謂、外傳停付外債之謡、全係根據熊希齡氏之建議而起、蓋熊氏前以水災嚴重、曾有延付外債之建議、財部當局、初未接受、今日報章、重復宣傳、實屬不確、財部對於内外債之維持、終始不渝、因國家債欵、關於國家信譽、苟内外債而發生動摇、是國家財政、業已不可收拾、我國財政情形、雖頻年内戰不息、然債額則有减無增、以民五迄今而言、十五年中、外債償付、已達十餘萬萬、至民二十九年、即可逐漸還清、屆時我國財政、自當更有辦法、至於内債、每月還一千五百餘萬、莫不信用昭著、雖舊債未清、新債又起、然較諸往昔、實已减少、財部當局、深信内外債信用之必須維持、故於此次公債慘跌、只明知係因社會人心不安、與投機者操縱所致、但亦儘量維持、現則正集議一永久維持公債之方法、或設一收買公債之委員會、或設一收買公債之公司、尚在縝密考慮中、不尚空言、務求實際、一經確定、即可實行、中國之財政、雖因頻年内戰而艱窘、然較諸其他各國、尚覺寛裕、苟内戰停息、災荒减少、則我國之財政、决不致再有恐慌、此以證財部歷年還償巨量債額、可以知之也云云、</p>
<h3>長江日輪擬租與英商經營</h3>
<p>英商尚未敢接受</p>
<p>日輪貨缺停航　本埠華商、對於日本船、已相戒不裝貨、不乘坐、故日清公司長江輪開行、幾全放空船、日商雖有貨物裝其輪船、但到埠後、我國工人、不代起卸、無法運輸、而該社上江輪大亨丸、此次由滬開班時、旣無乘客、又無貨載、由船主報告公司、結果、空輪往來、燒煤至巨、决計將上海宜昌班一路、實行停航、大亨丸未曾開出、</p>
<p>英輪營業發達　長江一路、向有六家公司、自中國江輪全部停業以來、祗有英日輪往來滬漢、此次抵制風潮發生、華輪不開、日船拒運、武漢水退後、正在百貨擁裝之際、故全部營業、遂爲英輪造一大好機會、近頃太古怡和長江船、不論進出口、貨客均滿、每開一輪、水脚至少萬餘兩、兩尚覺貨多船少、不敷需求</p>
<p>日貨私運外輪　日貨若裝日輪、運往長江一帶、各地華工、拒絶起卸、遂由各日商議定、由日人自辦報關、亦托英輪代運、故東糖疋頭海帶等項、仍有運出、英輪以營業所在、照常允予載運、此項日貨、以九江漢口湘省等埠起卸者居多、未悉該各處抗日團體、亦有所聞否、</p>
<p>日輪出租英商　自萬寳山案起、上海即抵制日輪、在上月十八日以後、更加緊張、滬上日清公司、向來長江航業最巨、在滬漢宜渝長沙等線、共有二十輪以上、今因揚子江各地華商一致拒運日船、一月有餘、無營業之可言、常此相持、將至輟業、而且非短時期内可望解决、邇日該社因鑒英輪生意擁擠、已有求過於供之勢、遂决擬將所有長江輪、租給本埠英商某輪船洋行、歸其經理、日清則坐收租金、免空停之損失、此事已經在秘密談判中、</p>
<p>英商尚未允可　本埠某英商行、雖因長江營業突盛、而感覺缺船、但租入日輪、恐引起華人惡感、轉使營業上受重大打擊、故一時尚未接受、日商之出租條件、猶在詳細考慮中、</p>

<p>日本是中國不共戴天的仇敵、有了日本就没有中國、有了中國、就没有日本、這是在過去事實上很明顯的證實出來、此次瀋陽事變、日軍强佔東北、舉國上下、莫不憤慨激昂、通電開會、奔走呼號、全國空氣、可說達到沸騰時期、所謂投筆從戎、嚙指血書之事、所在皆有、民氣之伸張由此可見一斑、但是徒然感情用事、是無濟於事的、日本之侵略中國、其處心積慮、已非一朝一夕、試讀田中義一之日本侵略滿蒙之積極政策、即可知其用心之險毒和野心之鉅大、</p>
<p>日本人接連不斷來欺壓我們、我們當然是忍無可忍、我們要時時刻刻對日本懐抱着復仇的態度、我們要時時刻刻站在對敵的地位、但是、要想把這許多奇恥大辱、洗刷一空、要想有一日能擺脫日本的侵略、我們所最要緊的是要對日本先要詳詳細細加以一番研究、就是說我們要明白認識日本過去的歷史、知道日本之種種現况以及了解將來可能的趨勢、有一句俗話說、呌做「知己知彼、百戰百勝」、這話眞是千眞萬眞、因爲不知道一件事情的眞相、瞎摸瞎撞的亂做、那是不會成功的、就是偶然成功、化力必定是很大、假使我們想把日本的權利爭回來、假使我們想阻止日本侵略的野心、那我們最要緊的事是把日本分析開來、加以詳細研究、把他看個清楚、</p>
<p>日本欺壓中國一步緊一步、他爲什麽敢這樣呢、就是因爲他把中國研究得清清楚楚、知道中國是可一步比一步緊的欺壓、中國對於日本的侵略、祇得退讓一步又一步、就是因爲對於日本的實情太不注意、因爲不知道人家的實情、人家來侵略、事前不知怎樣預防、事後不知怎樣對付、</p>
<p>中國人對於日本事情太不注意了、你能說出、</p>
<p>日本的人口有多少嗎、</p>
<p>日本的政治制度是怎樣的嗎、</p>
<p>日本的歷史是怎樣的嗎、</p>
<p>日本有多少面積嗎、</p>
<p>日本民族有什麽特性嗎、</p>
<p>日本的陸軍有多少嗎</p>
<p>日本的海軍有多少嗎</p>
<p>日本敎育狀况是怎樣的嗎、</p>
<p>日本經濟組織是怎樣的嗎、</p>
<p>日本在東北的地位是怎樣的嗎、</p>
<p>日本侵略滿蒙的政策是怎樣的嗎、</p>
<p>對於以上種種問題和類乎此的其他許多問題、不要說一般人說不出、就是享過高等敎育的、恐怕也是摸不清頭腦、對於人家、這樣不知、那樣不知、接觸起來就要吃虧、要免除這種吃虧、只有我們大家振作起來共同研究日本、</p>
<p>返過來看一看日本對於中國是怎樣、許多地方日本人知道中國的比中國人知道自己的還要明瞭、戴季陶先生在他所著的一本書呌做日本論的上面說、</p>
<p>「你們試跑到日本書坊裏去年看、</p>
<p>日本所做關於中國的書籍有多少、</p>
<p>哲學·文學·藝術·政治·經濟·社會······各方面、分門别類有幾千種、每一個月雜誌上所登載講「中國問題」的文章有幾百篇、參謀部陸軍省······派來中國長住調查或是旅行視察的人員、每年有幾十個、單是近年出版的叢書、每册在五百頁以上、每部在十册以上的、總有好幾種······中國這個問題、日本人也不曉得放在解剖台上、解剖了幾千百次、裝在試騐管裏化騐了幾千百次、我們中國人却只是一味的排斥反對、再不肯做研究工夫、幾乎連日本字都不願意看、日本語都不願意聽、日本人都不願意見、這眞呌做、「思想上閉關自守」、「智識上的義和團」了、</p>
<p>又有甘君在上海華通書局出版之日本第一號上說、</p>
<p>「日本對中國侵略之行所無事、固然在海陸軍之强、兵器戰艦之犀利、但是尤足使人驚心動魄的、是在於他們的學術偵察隊、我們試跑到東京的書店去看、他們所著關於中國問題的書籍、眞不知有多少、······即如中國經濟全書、支那省别全誌、篇幅之多、搜羅之備、尤足使我們驚驚駭汗、舉凡中國的某縣某村、某山某水、山高幾尺、水闊若干、某地人口若干、某地出産什麽、生産消費的統計、社會風俗的變遷、無不詳細縷述、開卷瞭然、我們久居鄉土所未知的、他們都已知道、其他秘密而未公開的圖籍、還不在少數、故他們以之應用經濟的戰爭、以之應用於軍事的攻略、那有不得心應手的道理、」</p>
<p>看了上邊所引兩段、我們感得作如何感想呢、實實在在我們早就應該把日本放在顯微鏡下做一個詳細的研究、正如日本人研究中國一樣、現在已經是遲了、我們所受的欺壓已經多而且大了、但是我們要追上去、趕緊的把日本研究得清清楚楚、</p>
<p>總結言之、研究日本有兩層用意、第一、我們要考察他研究他怎樣從一個被壓迫的狀况進到現在這樣的强盛地步、再要看看他在各種學術上已經有了些什麽貢獻、這一層用意在採人之長以供我們參考的、第二、我們要研日本的種種情形、從這些研究的結果中想出防制的策略、想出怎樣能報復我們過去的慘痛的國恥、譬如要打倒他的經濟侵略、我們大家一定要知道他的經濟的組織和變遷、一定要知道抵制日貨的實效是怎樣、又如想防止他在東北的野心、那我們怎可以不知道他的政策和他在東北的地位、我們要想進步、我們要想破壞日本對我們的侵略主義、那决不能等着有重大恥辱加於身上時、我們喊口號、發傳單、打電報、要去作戰可以有效的、最根本的工作是要研究、因爲知識可以告訴我們怎樣能防之前和制之於後、</p>
<p>我們應該時時刻刻注意日本、我們應該對於日本侵略中國的野心、特别加以注意、</p>
<p>關於日本研究的團體、現在因爲事實上的需要、漸漸的多起來了、在上海最著名而努力的有日本研究會和日本研究會、其研究已有相當的成績、現在我再來介紹一個新機關、就是無錫江蘇省立敎育學院、</p>

<h3>看菁我「一片愛國心」後</h3>
<p>— 敬之</p>
<p>說句老實話、菁莪劇社本來就是個剛出世的初無籍籍名的劇社、但自從這一次的在路市展覽會公演之後、方始很使一般人驚異地嘆道、幾乎遺失了一塊至寳、在交臂之間、眞的、菁莪劇社是塊剛被人發現的寳玉啊、我個人至少在相信、菁莪劇社、自此次公演之後、她一定可以很穩固地在劇社界裏站着一個後生可畏的地位、她是成功了、她不特博了全塲的觀衆拍的掌聲、眼涙、她更博得了全塲的人們底救民族、救辑家的熱情、所以她的這次成功、不特是說在這次路市展覽會中的許多劇社理比較地得來的、委實地就一般而說、她對於成功兩字、也可以不用什麽愧色了、致於她此次之所以會有如此大的成功之果實的原故、依我個人的意見、可以約略地分爲下列的幾點、</p>
<p>一、丁茲國難方殷的時分、政府旣不願粗鹵從事自貽伊戚、終始抱着鎭靜的態度、那魔麽喚醒民心、促起民情的責任、是非一般已知已覺者負起不可、但要負起此項重要的工作、自非要有力有效的方法不可、有效的方法、惟宣傳耳、宣傳之方法甚多、其中最能奏效者、又厥惟利用平民劇、菁莪劇社、就因爲認清了這一點、又能盡力的向這方面去努力、這正如他們自己所說的、「劇社運動的意義和使命、不僅是只在技巧方面的成熟、就算了　　丹麥操（氷攝）</p>
<p>事的、其最大而且最重要的意義、還是在它能夠激發出一種社會的效果來、」所以這樣、他們之有今次的莫大的成功、豈是偶然的事實、普通的劇社、是不能來和他們相提並論的、因爲他們有他們的主張的、他們是早就有家眷的、他們能很明澈了社會的現象、才來從事於他們的工作、所以他們是易於博得一般的人們的同情同感、所以他們是易於獲到成功、</p>
<p>二、採取通俗化的有意義的劇本、也是他們成功的原因之一、本來劇本是應該取諸於通俗、這樣才能使得我們這番的努力、在一般的觀衆們的心田裏、揷下了一支很清淅的苗秧的影像、不然、觀衆們是對於此劇根本上就很模糊了、當然是更談不上什麽了解不了解來、這樣、這就先敗了、我不記得是那個劇社了、他們公演了一支呌什麽第一聲的戲劇、但結果那怕你有何種的意義、終因不能得到一般觀衆們的了解、所以在几聲嗤嗤的辭中完場的啊、由此、我們更可以證明採取劇本、實在取那通俗化的不要、但在此要注意、光是通俗化也是不行、同時我們更須注意到質的方面丨丨就是要能有意義的才行、比如這次菁莪社所採取的「一片愛國心」的這支劇本、旣不違背那通俗的條件、同時它列充分地把兩個不同的民族之利害突衝等等的心理觀念、都十足地洩示了出來、使得一般人都成立一種救自己的民族、即使任何犧牲、也都可以不顧的信念來、這是此次菁莪劇社所以得有如此成功的第二個原因、</p>
<p>三、人材的整齊、其有助於公演之成功者、已爲一般人所周知的事實了、此次菁莪劇社、在這一方面、我相信他們一定是很費過一番苦心的、就以主角飾秋子的金光楣女土而言、她是個極其社會化的新女性、她旣賦有文學的涵養、又富於革命的熱情、更加諸以她的表情的細膩周密、舞臺經騐的豐富與淵博、（據說她在三四年前、就當過是劇的主角、和潑婦等劇的主角、）口齒的清朗與流利、尤其難能的、她能完全的忘去了自我、來體貼入微於該劇中人的地位、演來眞是絲絲入扣、以如此樣的一位多才多藝的難能可貴的全材則又安能不博得如此其多的掌聲、菁莪劇社之成功、得力於金女士實在不少、其次、女演員方面、如飾周芷芳的高雲彰女士、也是一位有望的戲劇人材、她那一副面部的表情丨尤其、一副沉着有力的眼睛、以及那行動舉止的得體、都是在在地表示出了她很有演劇的才</p>
<h3>假山石邊</h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<p>能的、只可惜她太少了些舞臺經騐、與年齡的關係吧、不免有時過於孩子氣了一點、還有那位飾亞男的劉嗣芬女士、也是個無從疵議的人物、她和金女士同樣的有很能使人那喜·恨·愛·哭·的魔力、只可她的國語太差了一點、致於那位飾田媽的王淑女士、也不差、雖然她操的是淮揚一帶的土白、但正因爲她飾的是個女僕丨丨田媽、所以這個與她所飾的劇中人的地位、到也没有什麽十分不相適合的地方了、致於男演員方面、除了那位飾唐華亭的宋訓倫君是很有力的外、其他的兩位、只可說是平平、這是爲該社所疏忽了的美中不足的一點、總之、統盤說來、都很能稱職、都没有使我們觀衆感到失望、這是他們丨丨菁莪劇社所以有這番之成功的第三個原因、</p>
<p>總上所述、則菁莪劇社之成功、當然非一般努力於此項運動的同志們只是羡慕所可及的、同時在該社的本身、我覺得一般主持該社的先生們、也着實有值得我們來敬佩的地方、現在我說句大家勉勵的話、我希望菁莪劇社諸君、母以此次之成功、就認爲滿足、應更發奮的前進努力、依着你們已認識清楚了的那個三確的目標、</p>
<p>最後、我爲菁莪祝福、願造就更偉大的成功、</p>

<h3>League of Nations Requests US Representative to Attend</h3>
<p>Zhang Haipeng Leads Troops to Invade Heilongjiang via the Tao'ang Railway. Yesterday, Five Japanese Train Cars Arrived at Mashan Jiazi. Fierce Fighting Between Tongliao Troops and Bandits. Japanese Planes Dropped Bombs to Aid the Bandits.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Holds Secret Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decides to Invite US Representative to Attend. Japan Insists on Direct Negotiations.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council held a secret meeting in the morning. Representatives from China and Japan were not present. The issue discussed was whether the US representative could participate in the Administrative Council meeting to handle the Manchurian dispute. The discussion lasted for a long time, adjourning around 11:00 AM. It was later heard that an agreement had been reached regarding inviting the US representative to attend. However, the resolution would only be known after the public meeting held in the afternoon. US representative Gilbert, the US Consul in Geneva, has received instructions from the US government to attend the Administrative Council's public meetings. However, the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, so the US representative has no right to speak. The United States is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East and is supporting the steps already taken by the League of Nations. Therefore, it is generally felt that it would be best if the Administrative Council could find a way for Gilbert to participate in the meeting and have the freedom to express his government's views during the public meeting. If this can be achieved, it would be the first time that a US representative has attended a meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, which was largely formed thanks to the efforts of former President Wilson. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning's secret meeting of the Administrative Council decided to invite a US representative to participate in the Administrative Council's discussions regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. It is said that this approach requires the prior consent of the representatives of both China and Japan. After the Administrative Council meeting, both Chinese and Japanese representatives met with Briand. It is said that China has already expressed its agreement. However, after a lengthy meeting between Japanese representative Yoshizawa and Briand, Yoshizawa stated that he must consult with the Japanese government regarding the invitation of the United States to participate in the Administrative Council's discussions. Therefore, it is expected that the Administrative Council will not meet until instructions are received from Tokyo, or at least not today. A senior member of the Japanese delegation told a Reuters reporter today that European countries do not yet fully understand the actual details of the situation. If Japanese residents are guaranteed protection from attacks, Japan is prepared to withdraw its troops to the railway zone. The Japanese military in Manchuria totals 14,000, with less than 6,000 outside the railway zone. The Japanese do not approve of excessive public demands in this matter. The Japanese are confident that direct negotiations are the ultimate outcome. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of China and Japan are adhering to their positions and showing no signs of compromise. However, there was a slight atmosphere of hope this morning. Yesterday morning, there was both anxiety and interest. Today, the interest remains, but the anxiety is less, probably because both sides showed moderate expressions yesterday. Many people expected the Administrative Council to continue its public meeting, so many attended this morning. However, the public meeting was postponed until the afternoon because a secret meeting was held in the morning to discuss whether to invite a US representative to attend the Administrative Council when considering the Manchurian incident. The secret discussion began at 9:30 AM at the residence of Chairman Briand. Briand had originally planned to convene the members of the Administrative Council who had not participated in the secret meeting yesterday afternoon to inform them of the progress, but this did not happen because the public meeting yesterday afternoon lasted a little too long. Briand is now informing each member who did not participate of the details of the discussions of the Administrative Council's full committee. The League of Nations is well aware of the difficulties of the situation, and the League's final decision has also attracted attention. Now that both sides are still insisting and not yielding, the Japanese representative wants to start direct negotiations without asking about the current position of the Japanese army in Manchuria, while the Chinese representative insists that Japan first withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian Railway zone. It is heard that the Chinese delegation received private news from Moscow this morning, saying that Japanese in Shanghai attacked Chinese shops. The Chinese representative has telegraphed Nanjing to inquire whether this is true. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Briand had agreed to reconvene the Council at 9:30 AM this morning to study the situation in the Eastern Provinces, as preparation for Briand's consultation with the chief Chinese and Japanese representatives this afternoon. Briand intends to expedite the matter, hoping to obtain an agreement this week so that China and Japan can begin diplomatic negotiations and Japanese troops can withdraw to within the South Manchurian Railway zone. Judging from the current situation, although China and Japan still firmly adhere to their original positions without the slightest concession, there are at least three factors that give the League of Nations great hope of resolving the Far Eastern crisis. First, Dr. Shi Zhaoji's speech has turned a local problem into a global problem and has a linked relationship with major issues such as arms reduction, the rise and fall of the League of Nations, and international cooperation to solve economic panic. Second, neither China nor Japan has exceeded the scope of their original demands. Third, Briand, a veteran diplomat with ingenuity and talent, assisted by the strength of France as chairman, attempting to save this organization of international cooperation and joint guarantee of peace, will undoubtedly achieve some success.

<p>(Geneva) According to well-informed sources within the League of Nations, the Council is now using various methods to achieve a friendly resolution of the Sino-Japanese crisis in Manchuria. If it becomes absolutely necessary, it will be forced to implement Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. It is hoped that an agreement can be reached within a few days so that the Japanese army can withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway concession, and direct diplomatic negotiations can begin between China and Japan. If the United States participates in the meeting, the US representative can enjoy all other rights except voting. In this way, the meeting can learn the US attitude towards various proposals, avoiding future resolutions that the United States cannot accept. It is said that the Council originally planned to send an international investigation committee in September, but it was abandoned after learning that the United States did not quite approve of it. Therefore, the Council and the US government both agree that a US representative should attend, and it is expected that the Japanese government will not be able to obstruct public opinion alone and directly refuse. As for today's informal meeting of council members, in addition to this matter, the focus of discussion is the interpretation of the Japanese representative Yoshizawa's statement yesterday. At this time, Japan insists on direct negotiations with China first, and then withdraws troops, while China refuses to negotiate with Japan before the Japanese army withdraws. Therefore, a deadlock has been formed, so it is generally believed that the situation is quite dangerous. (Guomin News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to German observations, the League of Nations Council's special meeting on the second day seems to have stalled in its greatest effort to seek a solution to the Liaoning-Jilin incident. It is now moving to behind-the-scenes consultations and fears that it will not hold another public meeting until a solution is negotiated, or unfortunately, before it has to declare itself unable to mediate. In terms of the aforementioned two points, those observing the situation here generally expect that a solution can ultimately be reached, and people in the League of Nations still hope that a compromise can be reached based on Briand's proposal. (Guomin News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Briand Warns China and Japan to Maintain Peaceful Attitude</h3>
<p>Yoshizawa Reports the Japanese Government's Views. Shi Zhaoji Rebuts Based on Facts.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Before the adjournment of the Council this afternoon, Briand delivered a speech warning China and Japan of their heavy responsibility to maintain peace in the Far East and urging them to exercise restraint and avoid unexpected events that would aggravate the situation. Briand also summarized the situation of the Manchurian case, saying that Japan has repeatedly assured that it has no malicious intentions and will withdraw its troops occupying Chinese territory as soon as it is certain that the lives and property of Japanese residents can be adequately protected. China has also declared that it has no intention of retaliation and will restrain its people from violence. Therefore, there is no reason for this dispute to lead to a major disaster. If it does become a major disaster, it will inevitably lead to a situation beyond human control. Therefore, the Council must fulfill its noblest and most important responsibilities today and approach it with perseverance. Japan and China must trust the League of Nations. Any country that does not hesitate to cause a major disaster, which will affect the whole world, must bear a terrible and heavy responsibility. In the current crisis, there is still the possibility of peace and dispelling misunderstandings. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have not been severed, and they can still sit around a table to discuss the history of this dispute. The Council will never abandon its responsibilities and will strive to fulfill its responsibilities with the limited methods available to it. According to the Japanese, the reason for the lack of progress in the situation since September 30 is due to the anti-Japanese movement and boycott of Japanese goods in China. Because of this, Japan cannot withdraw its troops, and in some places, Japanese residents have moved out of the country. On the contrary, China's opinion is that the National Government has made every effort to avoid loss of life, at least outside Manchuria. The Council hopes that China will be able to maintain this attitude, knowing that both sides have the necessity to remain calm and ease the situation. Furthermore, China has proposed to Japan to quickly withdraw Japanese troops outside the South Manchurian Railway concession, but Japan insists on immediately opening direct diplomatic negotiations. Finally, the United States has declared its full support for this meeting. This is the situation today. (Guomin News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After a detailed debate between the representatives of China and Japan yesterday, Briand gave a speech saying that the politeness of the Chinese and Japanese representatives was gratifying. The fact that the two Far Eastern countries can discuss this issue at the meeting of the Executive Yuan shows the ability of the League of Nations to survive. He also said that Japan has once again denied its imperialist desires, and he should strongly request both parties to stop all actions and wait for a solution. The most noteworthy thing about this meeting is that Briand declared in a firm tone that the Executive Yuan should use all kinds of methods to fulfill its own obligations, so that the League of Nations must use all its strength to prevent the expansion of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Great attention is paid here to the cooperation of the United States. Stimson's telegram to the League of Nations is a sign of rapprochement, but what methods and ways can be used to realize this rapprochement is a point of consideration here. It is difficult to say whether it can be realized or not until the United States participates in the meeting. However, what can be said is that the representatives of all countries in the Executive Yuan are looking for a way to transform the current trend into a concerted action. Once the will for peace of the League of Nations and the United States becomes a reality, the trends of China and Japan will inevitably be affected and easier to mediate. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council continued its meeting this afternoon to hear the Japanese chief representative Yoshizawa report the Japanese government's views on the Manchurian situation. The meeting began at 3:45 PM in a solemn atmosphere, even more so than the morning meeting. In practical terms, the situation seemed more tense than before. Yoshizawa, at the call of Chairman Briand, addressed the audience and read out a long article explaining the situation in Manchuria, Japan's huge interests in Manchuria, China's anti-Japanese propaganda, the various actions of Chinese soldiers and bandits, and the necessity of protecting Japanese residents in unrestful areas. He concluded by saying that when Japanese residents are no longer in danger, Japan will withdraw its troops into the railway zone. Yoshizawa said that Japan has twice risked its own survival to recover the urgent harm to Korea and Manchuria. Japan believes that these two regions are closely related to Japan's own destiny. Japan has no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, but has political and economic interests related to its survival. All countries have economic activities in this vast area, and Japan is the protector of equal opportunities and open doors in its activities. Since Japan arrived in Manchuria, foreign trade has increased tenfold, and China has also gained great benefits from the development of these provinces. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese have moved to Manchuria, and the population has doubled in the past 20 years. After sacrificing so many people and so much money, Japan should make great efforts to develop Manchuria after struggling to protect its own security. There is nothing wrong with this. The first element of development is the maintenance of order. Japan has used its firm policy to prevent all of China's internal turmoil from disturbing the peaceful and hard-working cause of Manchuria. Japan has invested heavily in Manchuria, totaling more than 200 billion yen. Japan's rights in Manchuria have been attacked repeatedly in recent years. Since the National Government took power, even the responsible Chinese rulers have openly advocated the complete elimination of Japan's rights in Manchuria. The Chinese authorities have been particularly provocative towards the South Manchurian Railway Bureau and towards the Japanese and Korean people for a long time. The murder of Nakamura by Chinese soldiers is one of the proofs of the Chinese's arrogant attitude towards Japan. Although the Japanese government encountered this provocative act, it still maintained a gentle and patient attitude, but the tension of the political atmosphere and the anger of the Japanese people were inevitable. Yoshizawa then brought up the fact that the South Manchurian Railway was attacked by the Chinese on September 18, and said that the Japanese government deeply hoped that China would realize the seriousness of the situation and know how to change its previous attitude and enter a new path with reasonable and constructive cooperation, so as to eliminate the various reasons for future conflicts between the two countries. The Japanese government is prepared to negotiate directly with China, but so far, this wish has not been realized. The Executive Council also has this wish. He means that the reason why China has been slow to accept this proposal is that the internal political situation in China is very chaotic. Yoshizawa then spoke of the peace agreement between the Nanjing government and the Guangzhou government, and then said that the Japanese army commander-in-chief's plan for the South Manchurian Railway incident on September 18 was a legitimate defense step to eliminate the imminent danger that affected the existence of Japan's position in Manchuria at any cost. The Japanese government is determined to withdraw its troops to within the South Manchurian Railway zone when the safety protection of its nationals is obtained with effective guarantees. When seeking a solution to this problem, one should not overemphasize the consideration of doctrines and the possibility of ideals, but must give as much consideration as possible to the actual and political truth in the situation. Now, anti-Japanese clamor is very strong throughout China, and the situation is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, he suggested that the Executive Council should first seek to establish an agreement between the two countries and a way to disarm in spirit. If the Chinese government makes every effort to stop the anti-Japanese movement in China and consult with Japan to formulate a prerequisite basis for restoring normal relations between the two countries, it can ease the situation as people want and eliminate the biggest obstacle to the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The withdrawal of troops is not tied to the implementation of this agreement, but to the safety of Japanese residents. He deeply hopes that a good understanding can be established between China and Japan. Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi replied that many of the points raised by the Japanese representative were irrelevant to the topic. The Japanese representative's claim that the former Chinese Foreign Minister had recently made hostile remarks was not true. As for the boycott, no country's government can force its people to buy what they do not want to buy. To solve this matter, the only way is to eliminate its cause. Dr. Shi then read out two telegrams from Nanjing, saying that Japanese planes had bombed undefended cities west of Shenyang with bombs again in the past few days. Shi also cited evidence of Chinese authorities protecting Japanese and Korean people, and then read out a report from an important American eyewitness stating that the Japanese army had attacked Shenyang for no reason. He concluded by saying that in view of the current situation, direct negotiations between China and Japan are impossible, so China is applying to the League of Nations. Yoshizawa, at the suggestion of British Foreign Minister Reading, agreed to inquire to Tokyo about the details of the attacks by Japanese aircraft that Dr. Shi had raised. Chairman Briand said that the Executive Council has a responsibility and cannot but fulfill this responsibility. He hoped that both parties would ask their governments not to aggravate the situation until it is resolved. He knew that both major countries were aware of the terrible responsibility to be borne by those who would further escalate the disaster. The Executive Council realizes that the moderation expressed by both China and Japan today has had a good impact. A British representative told people that today's meeting was a very good start to future meetings. A Reuters reporter met with Dr. Shi and asked about the news from Tokyo that the Chinese government was prepared to negotiate directly with Japan if it was sure that the League of Nations did not want to interfere. Dr. Shi said that this statement was directly contrary to the instructions he had received. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Declares Continued Efforts to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>German Consul-General in Shenyang Reports Number of Japanese Troops. American Erdman Confirms Japanese Provocation.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji informed the Council that China will continue to make every effort to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, but in view of the Japanese military's acts of aggression, if the Japanese government continues to use force as one end of its national policy and causes unfortunate results, Japan should bear full responsibility. China believes that the lack of understanding between the Chinese and Japanese nations is an inevitable result of the illegal actions of the Japanese army. If Japan can effectively withdraw its troops to within the South Manchurian Railway area, the relationship between the two nations will definitely improve greatly, and world peace can also be maintained as a result. In addition, the German Consul-General in Shenyang reported to the Council today that on the 9th of this month, outside the South Manchurian Railway area, the number of Japanese troops stationed in Shenyang was 2,700, Julu River 220, Jilin 1,260, Changchun 670, and Yingkou 180. Also, this afternoon, the Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zongdai read out a telegram from American Erdman, Asian Secretary of the Christian Education Annual Meeting, on the 13th of this month, which stated that I witnessed the occupation of Manchuria. This move was premeditated, carefully planned, and entirely due to the Japanese military's aggressive policy. The Chinese side has never had any provocative actions. The Japanese army still occupies the major places in South Manchuria and has never withdrawn. People in Asia all believe that today is the time for the International League to test its ability. The world must pay attention to the fact that Japan is now, like China, turning to the path of redification. Communism is developing. If the League of Nations fails, the world's turmoil will spread.

The people of Tongliao heard the news of a large number of Mongolian bandits attacking, and because the Datong passenger car was suspended, people were extremely panicked. The station engineer and the heads of the machinery and vehicle departments, as well as staff, retreated to Zhangwu County at 2:00 AM on the 14th. At 5:20 AM on the 14th, a Japanese armored train opened from Huanggu Tun to Julu River.

<h3>Darhan Wang of Inner Mongolia Escapes from Shenyang to Beiping</h3>
<p>Not Seduced by Japan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Darhan Wang of Inner Mongolia, who was previously in Shenyang, was incited by the Japanese army to summon the forty-eight banners of Inner Mongolia, declare independence, and was offered special interests, which he refused. The Japanese then transferred Wang Darhan to an affiliated area in Southern Manchuria for surveillance and mistreatment. Darhan managed to escape in disguise and arrived in Beiping last night. He immediately met with Deputy Zhang, reporting the Japanese coercion and the Japanese army providing weapons to various parts of Mongolia, sending people to various places to incite independence from China. Zhang praised Darhan for his deep understanding of righteousness, comforted him, and plans to request the national government to give special commendation. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A reporter visited Darhan Wang, who was ill. His secretary, Zhu Xinong, met in his place. According to Zhu, Honjo previously sent Kikutani Aki, a clerk of the South Manchurian Railway, and Major General Koki to visit Wang Darhan, inciting the independence of Inner Mongolia. Japan promised to fully supply money and military supplies, and guarantee various interests of Inner Mongolia, but demanded strict secrecy in the international arena, not to say that Japan was the master, otherwise, even if Darhan did not do it, there would be others who would. Kikutani Aki visited Darhan four times in total. Unable to get results, he secretly sent troops to monitor and put pressure on him. Darhan, who is naturally introverted, escaped in disguise to Beiping. Bao Shanyi and Han Ruiting are individual actions, without any power. The Mongolian people will never obey. Although they received a large number of military supplies from the Japanese army in Yikeshu, no one used them. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The famous Mongolian leader Darhan arrived in Beiping last night from Shenyang at great risk. When the September 19th Incident occurred, Darhan was in Shenyang and was detained by Japanese soldiers under strict surveillance, who wanted him to declare Mongolian independence and promised to supply him with weapons and ammunition, and urged him to summon the leaders of the forty-eight banners of Mongolia to Shenyang to discuss the establishment of an autonomous Mongolian government. According to Darhan, he later managed to escape from the Japanese soldiers, fled to the home of a foreign friend, disguised himself as a farmer, and yesterday mingled with the crowds of evacuee coolies to board a train in a third-class carriage, fortunately without being recognized. When the train passed the Japanese soldier sentry line, he and his family took a first-class carriage to Beiping. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Refuting Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>When the League of Nations Administrative Council was discussing how to deal with the serious incident between China and Japan before September 30th, the Japanese government repeatedly declared: "The Manchurian Incident is a local problem between China and Japan that can be resolved through direct negotiations between China and Japan. No third country should intervene." Even the League of Nations' organization committee investigating the facts was opposed. Unfortunately, the League of Nations did not discern its conspiracy at the time and failed to overcome all difficulties. It executed its authority of the solemn covenant and succumbed to the Japanese arrogance. It only made a perfunctory conclusion with the hope and trust that Japan could withdraw its violent troops before October 14th. Since September 30th until recently, the Japanese have not only failed to fulfill their promise to withdraw troops accepted in the League of Nations conference, but have intensified their violence. The League of Nations Council has reconvened for this purpose. And the Japanese demand direct negotiations. As before, no third country is allowed to intervene. This extremely absurd and unreasonable behavior cannot but be severely criticized.</p>
<p>According to the usual rules of establishing a country, if anything happens between two countries that is enough to hinder national relations, the proper way is to jointly seek a solution through diplomatic means. However, the current situation is not the case. First, the Japanese did not directly propose sincere negotiations to us through proper diplomatic means before September 18th. Instead, they suddenly used violence to oppress us. They started the war without declaration. Their diplomacy has long been derailed, and their politics have long been abnormal. They did not directly negotiate before September 18th, but demanded direct negotiations after the violence was launched. China will never recognize this kind of contradictory, barbaric, willful, and world-blinding proposition. Second, after the Japanese military violence was launched, our country retreated step by step with a completely non-resistant attitude, while the Japanese army recklessly committed its crazy violence, advancing step by step, occupying our cities, massacring our soldiers and civilians, confiscating our property, and changing the flag. The only thing missing is the formal declaration of war. They have already implemented military operations and regarded us as an enemy country. The national relations between the two countries have been cut off invisibly. We have been humiliated for no reason. What individuals cannot endure, it is said that a nation can be servile and absolutely obey the will of the Japanese and let them manipulate it. Japan has already severed diplomatic relations, so what kind of direct negotiation can be said? Third, the violent troops entrenched within our territory have not yet withdrawn. The gunboats ordered to come to our Yangtze River and coastal commercial ports are coming one after another. The planes bombing Jinzhou are giving us serious threats from time to time. The so-called independence movement in Manchuria and Mongolia is in full swing. Under the circumstances of intensified violence, the Japanese have not had the sincerity to resolve this serious problem as soon as possible. Their determination to rigorously implement the continental policy, destroy peace, and trample on international covenants has been bluntly explained by the Japanese themselves in their violent actions after September 30th. Even if our country wants to negotiate directly, where should we start? Fourth, the Japanese military's violence this time is not only a simple issue between China and Japan, but also sufficient to persecute the world and give the entire human race a great threat. Preventing this kind of violence that is enough to endanger all mankind is not only China's responsibility, but all countries in the world should also bear this responsibility. China has done its best to endure and restrain itself, and has repeatedly retreated in the face of the Japanese military's violence, which is to be responsible to the world and to all mankind. How to prevent the continued increase of this kind of violence in the future? How to make the culprits who stirred up the disaster bear the responsibilities they should bear? It should be jointly planned by countries around the world. China really has no possibility and necessity for direct negotiation. On the 9th, the three giants of the Japanese military held a meeting to discuss the issue of troop withdrawal. There were five items in the resolution. The third item was "After the new regime appears, local negotiations will be conducted." The fourth item was "Troops will be withdrawn after the establishment of a new regime that is sufficient to guarantee the lives and property of Japanese residents." As evidenced by this resolution, the so-called direct negotiations by the Japanese are not with the central government of our country or the local government of the Northeast, but to wait for the so-called independence of Manchuria and Mongolia to succeed, and then conduct its ridiculous negotiations under the new regime under its protection. Even if I want to negotiate directly, in addition to unconditionally recognizing the Northeast as a Japanese protected territory and adding some humiliating treaties, will the Japanese allow it? Can they accept our country's negotiations?</p>
<p>Based on the above five explanations, China cannot accept the proposal for direct negotiations today. The attitude held by the Chinese nation today is to place the entire country and nation on the basis of the dignity of international covenants, and listen quietly to the judgment of public justice. If the international covenanting countries abandon this responsibility and shirk it to China, then China's future actions will be nothing more than two ways. One is to make a humiliating alliance under the city and surrender to Japan. The other is to use the blood of the entire nation to fight the last flesh-and-blood battle with the powers to regain public justice and the freedom of survival of our nation. Apart from these two paths, there is no other way. However, the Chinese people dare to solemnly declare that a nation with a 4,000-year-old civilization has been exhausted by the country and will never bow down to others in the end. If this cannot be done, then we can only wait for the natural development of the situation and take the second bloody path with an attitude of not avoiding it at all.</p>
<p>This is the solemn attitude of the Chinese people at present, and we sincerely hope that the international covenants will clearly recognize it. As for the few domestic people who are procrastinating, timid, and content with the status quo, who cannot understand the current seriousness and the danger of the future, and advocate accepting the so-called direct negotiation proposal, the result will not only make our country lose its national rights in addition to being humiliated, but also completely ruin the nation's spirit of establishing the country. The people of the country should rise up together to spit on their faces and severely stop the fallacies of these people.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government and Public Opinion Focus on Geneva</h3>
<p>Braving the Disapproval of the World</p>
<p>Striving to Avoid Interference from Third Parties</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The focus of the Japanese government and public opinion regarding the Manchurian Incident has now shifted to Geneva. They are now closely watching the discussions of the League of Nations. Although Japan still insists on direct negotiations with China and does not accept interference from third parties, it is now gradually realizing that there must be some action to break the deadlock. The difficulty lies in the fact that the Japanese side firmly insists on opening negotiations first and then withdrawing troops, so as to ensure that China is willing and able to maintain law and order. The Chinese side firmly insists on withdrawing troops first and then opening negotiations. Although Japan's attitude against interference by the League of Nations has not softened, those who closely observe current affairs here believe that a way can be found to enable the League of Nations to guide China and Japan into direct negotiations without losing face on either side. According to informed sources in Tokyo, what the Japanese government is now uneasy about is that the League of Nations may lightly believe the words of one party and disregard the truth of the Manchurian situation, and interfere arbitrarily based on theoretical and idealistic views. The Japan Times commented on this point today, which can be regarded as the general opinion of Japanese observers. The newspaper said that if the League of Nations intervenes, it will only be based on the actions of Japanese soldiers in the past few days, and will never pay attention to the various sufferings that Japan has suffered in Manchuria. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Count Uchida, President of the South Manchurian Railway, has arrived in Tokyo and will immediately consult with government officials on the Manchurian situation and the policies to be adopted when negotiations with China begin in the future. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that it is now believed that the Nanjing government has ordered Jiang Zuobin, the minister to Tokyo, not to talk to Foreign Minister Shidehara again, so as not to imply that his talks are intended to negotiate directly with Japan. He also said that the conversation between Minister Jiang and the Foreign Minister yesterday lasted for three hours, discussing each other's opinions and difficulties. Minister Jiang's attitude was very sincere. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a special meeting in Geneva yesterday to discuss the Manchurian Incident. What is the Japanese public opinion? There is no indication yet. However, judging from the phenomenon, the Japanese government and public opinion have deeply realized the serious nature of the overall situation. The editorials of various newspapers seem to focus on the fact that Prime Minister Wakatsuki exchanged views with the main Japanese politicians on the tense internal and external situation in the past few days. The newspapers hope that Wakatsuki's efforts will be able to unify public opinion. In this way, the cabinet can fulfill its responsibilities with greater trust and perseverance. Several parties have suggested convening a joint emergency meeting of national political elders and politicians to consider the best way to deal with national difficulties. Most newspapers regard this move as useless, because Japan's fundamental policy towards Manchuria has long been decided and cannot be changed, that is, to protect the rights and interests of Japanese people under various circumstances. When these rights and interests are safe, it will never interfere in China's internal affairs. The Hochi Shimbun stated that the possible resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council on the Manchurian Incident are very important. If the Administrative Council acts with the impression that the Japanese government can no longer restrain its soldiers, the relationship will be very significant. Japan has never been subjected to such severe criticism from international organizations in history as it is today. From this point alone, the government and the people can be encouraged to deal with the overall situation with completely consistent opinions and policies. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Snippets of British and French Public Opinion</h3>
<p>London This morning, most London newspapers criticized the Manchurian situation. General public opinion believes that even if Japan has dissatisfaction with China, it is unreasonable to take coercive measures, resulting in a situation that could plunge the Far East into war. The Daily Telegraph's editorial this morning said that the Japanese government condoned the military to handle it themselves without first submitting the dispute to the League of Nations for public judgment. This kind of behavior is undeniable, so the Japanese government is actually responsible. If a war breaks out in the Far East, the scope of the disaster will be unpredictable. French public opinion can be seen in the Paris Times' editorial this morning. The newspaper detailed the seriousness of the situation, but said that the League of Nations must devote its full efforts to seeking direct negotiations between China and Japan, without interfering in fundamental events or imposing conditions for settlement. This morning, Chinese people in the UK gathered in Liverpool and issued a resolution calling for the help of the British people and protesting against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. After the Chinese people telegraphed the Nanjing government, they sent a document to the British government, pointing out that the purpose of the Japanese invasion was to annex Manchuria, and demanded that the Japanese withdraw their troops, compensate, apologize, and punish the responsible soldiers.

<h3>Repelling Japanese Goods Benefits British Textile Industry</h3>
<p>London, the center of the British textile industry, Manchester, is now paying close attention to the Geneva Conference. The opinions of large manufacturers naturally tend to material aspects.

<h3>German Parliament Debates Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>The National Rights Party Launches Great Disruption</p>
<p>Brüning Quietly Leaves the Venue</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th, Berlin Dispatch: Yesterday, the parliament reconvened, and Prime Minister Brüning announced his policies. At noon today, the parliament began to debate the Prime Minister's declaration. The National Socialist Parties did not attend. When Dr. Frick, a member of their party, stood up to speak and criticize, the crowd suddenly rushed in, so Brüning made a gesture of standing up and quietly left the meeting. Dr. Frick severely criticized the Brüning government, saying that its foreign policy government was trampled on by French imperialism and suffered a disastrous defeat. The National Socialist Party intends to form an alliance with countries suffering from the scourge of the treaty, etc. His party members cheered endlessly, the Communist Party responded with abusive voices, and the other parties remained silent.</p>
<p>Nationalist, 13th, Berlin Dispatch: The parliament reconvened this afternoon. Prime Minister Brüning delivered a powerful speech and was determined to win or lose with the National Rights Party. If the government party fails in the vote of no confidence, or Prime Minister Brüning implements the dissolution of the parliament, then this short meeting of the parliament will be the last one. Prime Minister Brüning took the stage in a tense and silent atmosphere, and there was not an empty seat in the auditorium. The French Ambassador Ponce sat in the diplomatic seat, which was very eye-catching. However, after the opening ceremony, the National Rights Party left the venue together, leaving only a few sitting in the back row to report the meeting. Therefore, the parliament was not crowded. This expression made Prime Minister Brüning's attitude more firm, and his speech was also extremely passionate. He ignored the shouts of the Communists, and the Speaker ordered a Communist to leave the hospital, and the party members tried their best to oppose it, and a big dispute arose. Brüning remained calm and waited for the dispute to subside. Brüning began his speech by saying that he would implement the government's foreign policy as Foreign Minister, based on the spirit of the Young-Ing-German Conference and the Berlin-Franco-German Conference. Those who advocate changing this policy really do not know what they are thinking. Brüning continued, "Germany has always believed that the way to save the country lies in international negotiations and foreign aid, but the suffering Germany has suffered in the past ten years cannot be compared to any neighboring country, because our financial resources were already exhausted when the world's misfortune befell our Germany. We call on all countries in the world to implement international unity. Who says it is not appropriate? Although our loud call is not in vain, our recent future is still unknown." Brüning then praised President Hoover's vision and said that debt suspension is only a temporary solution. To avoid future disasters, we must continue to work hard. This requires the concerted efforts of the international community. The rulers of all countries frankly discussed in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin, which is the prelude to international cooperation. International cooperation must be based on fairness and equality, otherwise it will not help to break through the world's difficulties. Brüning then spoke about financial issues, saying that the government's primary task is to adapt to the ever-changing environment, but now it cannot plan what will happen in a few weeks. What can be reported now is that the government has no intention of stopping the gold standard. Brüning touched on domestic issues, saying that the government is determined to severely deal with various political transgressions and eliminate the forces that undermine patriotism and sacrifice the youth. Brüning further said that the government is now trying its best to restore private enterprises, and everything is aimed at being pragmatic and not exaggerating, etc. After the speech, the parliament announced that it would adjourn to the afternoon of the next day. The opposition party's obstruction of the adjournment was ineffective.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Jilin and Changchun Plan to Station Permanently</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communications: According to a person from Jilin, it has been half a month since the Japanese troops occupied Jilin. Although the news of the withdrawal is widely spread, the recent trend shows that their methods are even more serious. The saying of withdrawing troops is probably not something that can be realized in a short time. Currently, machine guns and artillery have been set up on the old Beishang fort outside the city, the Tuan Shanzi in Dongguan, and the roof of the water plant, aiming at the city. Trenches have been dug outside Linjiang and Zhihemen, and infantry are scattered, as if facing a great enemy. I wanted to go to investigate, but the Japanese army strictly prohibited Chinese people from stopping. A slight gaze would endanger their lives. The Japanese side first recruited local workers for this move, using coercive methods to force them to work. Curfews are announced at 8:00 p.m. every night. Sentry posts are scattered inside and outside the urban area. Chinese people are arbitrarily inspected when they pass by. Airplanes are coming less and less frequently, and when they do come, they circle for an hour or two before leaving. Fortunately, no bombs have been dropped in the city, but people are still panicked. Many people are moving to other ports every day. Since traffic on the Pingji Railway has been obstructed, all passengers have been taking the Jilin-Changchun Road, but this road is now completely in the hands of the Japanese. The original fare was set in current foreign currency, converted from Harbin foreign currency. Recently, only current silver dollars or Japanese currency are accepted. As for the exact number of Japanese troops stationed in Jilin, it is difficult to investigate because they come and go from time to time. Moreover, a large number of poor people and people in Western suits have suddenly been found in the city streets recently. It is learned that these people are all Japanese spies, most of whom are Koreans. The people are afraid of their power and dare not talk about current affairs. They dare not even tear up the so-called notices issued by the Japanese Military Police Department. It is said that some people have been arrested for this and their lives are still uncertain.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the Japanese army entered the city, they occupied all the important agencies. After the provincial government was forced to change to the Chief Executive Office, the Japanese army gate of the Public Security Bureau and the Japanese flag were removed at the same time, but troops were still stationed inside to monitor as before. As for the Deputy Commander's Office, it has now been changed to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, and the Japanese flag is hoisted high at the gate, with strict security. The puppet Chief Executive Xi Qia is escorted by two Japanese soldiers when he enters and exits, standing on both sides of the car, no different from a prisoner. It is rumored outside that Zhang Jinghui of Harbin has organized a provincial government in Harbin. After investigation, it was found to be inaccurate, and the official documents of the puppet Chief Executive Office in the provincial capital, ordering the Harbin Special Zone Police Administration and consulting the Chief Executive Office of the Special Zone, were all returned yesterday, with the words "There is no such agency in Jilin" written on them. It can be seen that Xi's political orders have not even left the provincial capital.</p>
<p>According to a person from Changchun, after the Japanese army occupied Jilin and Changchun, they falsely claimed to be withdrawing their troops to the outside world, but in reality, they had already taken it for themselves. Their so-called withdrawing troops to return to defense and having no territorial ambitions is a deception to the European and American powers. The Nanling Camp in Changchun has a total of 250-600 houses for officers and soldiers. After being destroyed by Japanese artillery and fire on the 19th of last month, less than one-third of the remaining houses were occupied by the Japanese army. Currently, 300 troops are stationed there, with machine guns and artillery, and strict security. Bombs and mines are ambushed in all directions. The commander of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army, Domon, believed that the Erdaogou in Nanling was the throat of Changchun and should be stationed with heavy troops for defense. At the end of last month, he telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Honjo, for approval to build barracks in Nanling and increase troops. On the 6th and 7th of this month, survey team members have been dispatched to Nanling to survey the camp base, draw maps, and build. Boundary posts are erected outside the ridge, with the words "Occupied Land for Military Use by the Great Japanese Army" written on them. The land of the people near the ridge is often划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划划</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Conceals and Instigates Independence of the Northeast</h3>
<p>Xi Qia Shamelessly Relies on the Japanese</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: It has become an open secret that the Japanese side is instigating lawless elements in the Northeast to form various illegal organizations. Recently, because foreign journalists and consuls gathered in Shenyang, fearing exposure of their instigation conspiracy, a declaration was issued on the 4th of this month to cover up the situation. The wording is as follows: "(1) The old government of the former three northeastern provinces can no longer stand. Recently, the movement to establish a new regime has sprung up everywhere like clouds. The common people are singing praises of the Japanese army's power and are unwilling to support the former leaders again. This is nothing more than the result of years of resentment and the tyrannical desires of warlords. The Japanese army stands in a position of transcendent politics and diplomacy, focusing on maintaining law and order, raising troops, and quietly waiting for changes. Therefore, the Japanese army will not recognize any secret planning related to the establishment of a regime in Shenyang, except for maintaining law and order. Although the 30 million people living in the Northeast will create a paradise of coexistence and co-prosperity with us, this is what the Japanese army sincerely hopes. (2) For the sake of the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan and to enhance the welfare of the people in the Northeast, the commander of the Japanese army specially informs the general public in the Northeast that the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies is a response to the challenge of the tyrannical and unprincipled Northeastern military and police. This is purely a means of self-defense. The root cause of the incident lies in maintaining international justice and the Northeastern military and police's autocracy. They oppress the people, impose harsh taxes to impoverish them, and infringe upon Japan's legitimate rights and interests. In reality, they are only seeking self-interest and expanding their own power, in effect fooling the 30 million people in the Northeast, harming Sino-Japanese relations, and violating the will of heaven. The Japanese army's enemy is only this tyrannical Northeastern military and police, so we resolutely reject them, uphold justice and humanity to save the people, and promote their well-being. The people trust the Japanese army's protection, and farmers, merchants, and traders can live in peace. We hope to work hard to permanently establish the foundation for the eternal prosperity of the Northeast." Although the Japanese side is doing its best to instigate the independence of the Northeast, apart from Xi Qia, Kan Chao Xi, and others who are willing to act as accomplices, Peng Jin Kai, Yu Chong Han, and others ultimately do not dare to act recklessly. Recently, because the people of the country have risen up to telegraph the central government to investigate and deal with the situation, Yuan and others fear that once the Japanese army withdraws, they will lose their reliance and be intolerable to the people. They issued a declaration on the 7th, stating their position, saying that the organization of the Maintenance Association is only a temporary relief for the local area. It is neither a separate government nor a declaration of independence, etc. However, Xi Qia in Jilin certainly regards himself as the head of a government under the protection of the Japanese, issuing orders shamelessly. However, all civil and military officials in the province, except for Jilin, Changchun, Yanji, and other places where Japanese troops are stationed and can help Xi Qia with oppression, still remotely follow Zhang Zuoxiang and listen to his orders. Last week, Zhang Zuoxiang telegraphed from Jinzhou, ordering officials in various counties not to listen to the orders of officials in Jilin before the Jin-Ping meeting is decided. Therefore, the newly appointed officials in various places appointed by Xi Qia have been rejected when they went to take office. The sphere of influence of the Xi clan is also limited. On the other hand, the Japanese are monitoring Xi very strictly. In addition to recommending two military officers as Xi's advisors, there are three others as guards. These five people are with him day and night, not even far away when Xi is sleeping. The military and political hall of the pseudo-government office is divided into six departments: military balance, military supplies, military law, military medicine, staff, and military equipment. The heads of the military balance and staff departments are both Japanese. Each time the pseudo-government office meets, Xi does not dare to hold the meeting without the two Japanese advisors and the two Japanese department heads. His timid appearance is both lamentable and laughable (October 9).</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin Leaves Beijing for Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin, the former president of the Legislative Yuan, has been passive since March of this year for some reason. It has been several months since then. Recently, because of the urgent national crisis with Japan, he believes that national unity is necessary to save the country and resist foreign aggression. Therefore, he left Beijing for Shanghai at 10:00 AM today (the 14th). After the Cantonese committee members arrive in Shanghai, he will meet with them face-to-face to discuss the issue of peaceful unification, hoping to work together to overcome national difficulties. A summary of Mr. Hu's departure from Beijing is as follows:</p>
<p>Chiang and Hu Meet Yesterday (the 13th) at 3:00 PM, Hu and Chen Mingshu went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to meet Chiang. Chiang showed great respect to Hu, briefly mentioning past grievances, saying that he has been looking forward to Mr. Hu coming out to take charge of national affairs. Hu said that in the face of the current Japanese disaster, the crisis is imminent, and all previous matters can be left aside. The comrades in the North and South should unite to jointly plan a way to resist foreign aggression. Apart from this, there are no other important tasks at present. He has already drafted a telegram to the comrades in Guangdong, identifying this goal together. Chiang replied that he felt very sorry for the incident in the Eastern Provinces, saying that he has little experience in politics and that he has temporarily taken over the government during the military period and has always wanted to get rid of it and focus on military affairs. This ambition has not diminished to this day. He then went to see various important people and shook hands with Hu. When Hu was about to leave, he said to Chiang, "I will send a telegram to urge the comrades in Guangdong to come north as soon as I arrive in Shanghai." This morning, before Hu left Beijing, Chiang personally went to Xiangpu Camp to see him off and talked for more than a quarter of an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>Arrival at the Station After 8:00 AM, Legislative Yuan members Feng Zhaoyi, Wang Yongbin, Zhang Fengjiu, etc., all went to Xiangpu Camp to pay their respects to Hu and see him off. At about 9:00 AM, Hu, along with his daughter Hu Mulan and doctor Deng Zhende, took a car from his residence at Xiangpu Camp to Xiaguan. After entering the platform, he boarded the No. 1 flower car prepared by the headquarters and shook hands with the well-wishers one by one to express his gratitude for their trouble. Mr. Hu was wearing a long gown and mandarin jacket, and his face was unusually plump and white. When talking to the well-wishers, he was all smiles.</p>
<p>Escorts In addition to Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Renjie, Wang Bailing, and others, his daughter Hu Mulan, doctor Deng Zhende, former National Government Secretary Li Pan, and attendants were also traveling with him. A total of three flower cars were hooked up. Hu, his daughter, Chen Mingshu, and Li Pan rode in the No. 1 flower car, Zhang Renjie rode in the No. 501 flower car, and Wu Tiecheng and others rode in the No. 503 flower car. The station had sent many military police officers from the Railway Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters to provide protection.</p>
<p>Well-wishers Those who came to the station to see him off included Zhu Peide, Gu Zhenglun, Chen Zhaoying, He Yaozu, Shao Yuanchong and his wife, Legislative Yuan members Wang Yongbin and Zhang Fengjiu, Legislative Yuan Acting Secretary-General Li Xiaosheng, and more than a hundred other people. The express train departed at 10:00 AM. Hu thanked the well-wishers from the car window, and all the well-wishers also took off their hats to pay their respects. According to those close to Hu, it has not yet been decided when Hu will return to Beijing after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Levee Breaches in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: This year's flood in Hubei Province is the worst in the country. Most of the official and civilian levees along the Yangtze and Xiang rivers have been breached.

A total of 17 civilian levees along the Yangtze River and 11 on the Xiang River were breached. Repairing the breaches alone will require 3 million yuan. It is unknown when complete repairs will be completed. The names and addresses of the breached levees, as investigated by the bureau, are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Wuhan Begins Repairing Roads and Embankments</h3>
<p>More Than 20 Miles of Civilian Housing Completely Destroyed by Wind and Waves, Number of Disaster Victims Dying Daily, Plans to Find Ways to Send Them Back to Their Hometowns Hankou Dispatch: Since the floodwaters receded, the accumulated water in Wuhan has gradually entered the river. The most serious period seems to have been barely survived. However, the drainage plan has not been implemented for a long time. The accumulated water inside and outside the Ping-Han Railway is still several feet deep. Although other streets have receded, the silt is piled up and the stone paths are rugged, making it very difficult to walk. As for the damaged riverbanks and breached embankments, there is no trace of human habitation, and the scene is desolate. Only sparse forests and fallen leaves are fighting against the golden wind. In order to revive the market, the Wuhan authorities have begun to clean up the mud and repair the roads. The cleaning of the mud is handled by the health authorities, first cleaning up the major trunk roads, and then cleaning up the branch roads and alleys. The repair of the roads is handled by a committee organized by the Disaster Relief Branch. First, the section of Zhongshan Road from Yiyuan to the Water Tower will be repaired, followed by the section from the Xingying to Xinsheng Road and the section from Yuyinli to Tongfengli, and then extended to the entire city. Because the project is still small, it cannot accommodate many disaster victims. It has also been decided to repair the nearby embankments and sluices first. The Wutai, Wuqing, and Wufeng sluices in Wuchang, the Qingshan Dam, and the Zhanggong Dam in Hankou, and the Yongxing Dam in Hanyang, require about 30,000 workers. The survey has now been completed, and construction can begin next month. However, the removal of accumulated water has not yet been taken into account. The areas flooded are mostly inhabited by poor people, and the houses are not very strong. After being flooded for too long, collapses are often heard. On the 8th, a strong gust of wind suddenly arose, and the waves rolled over. Outside the railway, from the vicinity of the German Stadium, along Zhongzheng Road, Zhongshan Park, to Qiaokou, Chajiadun, and other areas, spanning more than 20 miles, except for the Puai Hospital and the Mei Father Hospital, the remaining civilian houses and the houses in Zhongshan Park were all destroyed by the waves. The exact number of residents killed and injured has not yet been investigated. Those crushed under the walls or drowned in the water must be numerous. As for the disaster victims in the various shelters, the number of deaths from infectious diseases is increasing by the hundreds every day. Taking Wuchang as an example, according to a report from the Emergency Relief Office, the number of corpses of disaster victims buried in September reached as many as 1,479. Those buried by themselves are not included. The situation in Hanyang is roughly the same. Most of the disaster victims in the various shelters are registered in other counties. The Emergency Relief and Disaster Relief Branch is now finding ways to send them back to their hometowns. The various shelters will be closed immediately. The disaster victims remaining in Hankou will be housed in one place before the construction relief begins, so as to provide care (October 8).</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Committee</h3>
<p>The First Step is to Plan the Repair of Embankments and Polders</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The severity of the flood disaster in Hunan Province is unprecedented in the last hundred years. The loss of polder fields in the ten counties bordering Dongting Lake alone is already over 4 million mu, and the annual harvest has been reduced by more than 20 million shi. If the embankments and polders are not repaired quickly, there will be no hope for spring plowing next year, and the people in the lakeside counties will inevitably sit and wait for death. If repairs are to be made, the work is extensive and the funds are huge. According to estimates by engineering experts, they are divided into four categories: (A) Breaches: A total of more than 1,500 polders were breached. Each polder has four or five breaches at most, and one or two at least. At a minimum, each polder is calculated with two breaches, and there are also more than 3,000 breaches. Each breach is as long as 300 zhang, and as deep as 2 zhang. It is estimated that the cost of repairing each breach will be several thousand yuan at most, and no less than several hundred yuan at least. (B) Embankments: The embankment soil has been immersed in water for a long time, eroded by wind and rain, and washed by waves. Those that were originally 1 zhang 7 or 8 chi high are now only a few chi high. Those that were originally 2 or 3 zhang wide are now less than 1 zhang. A lot of money is needed to restore them to their former appearance. (C) Protection: The polder embankment has protective insurance costs, just as the car road has road maintenance costs. In the future, if the embankment and polder are completed, if they are not protected from time to time, even if they are repaired and consolidated, they will inevitably be breached in the event of a flood. Therefore, the protection of the embankment and polder is also the most important part of the project. (D) Total amount of funds required: The above projects are only a rough estimate. It is estimated that the repair cost is 6 or 7 yuan per mu at most, and 3 or 4 yuan at least, with an average of 4 yuan per mu. Calculated on the basis of 4 million mu, a total of 16 million yuan is required. The current financial resources of the Hunan provincial government and the people are difficult to bear. It is said that He Jian intends to borrow a large sum from the Shanghai banking group, using the owners' fields as collateral according to the title deeds. Construction Department Director Tan Changkai has been sent to Shanghai to negotiate everything. He also believes that this project is of great importance, and it is not possible to proceed smoothly without recruiting experts in civil engineering and people with rich experience in managing lake field water conservancy. A Hunan Water Conservancy Committee was specially established in the Construction Department, and 24 people, including Chen Lingzeng, were hired as committee members. The inaugural meeting was held in the Construction Department at 1:00 PM on October 7. The first step is to repair the embankments and polders in the lakeside counties, and then plan the water conservancy of the entire province. The list of committee members and the organizational regulations are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Tragic Situation of the Plague Spreading in Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Xi'an Dispatch: Northern Shaanxi has suffered consecutive years of crop failure since 1924. Moreover, in 1928, rat populations were suddenly discovered in various counties. Wherever plows were used in the mountains and fields, dozens or hundreds of rats emerged. Half-dried seedlings were almost completely gnawed away. The rat populations in the residences were equal to sheep herds. They walked with people during the day and gathered to yell at night. It is true that every family has incomplete utensils, and the food is mostly the leftovers of rats. However, the people are deceived by superstition and only engage in seeking gods and praying for blessings, allowing it to take its course. In the autumn of 1928, a strange disease was discovered in a small village in Shiwanzhen, Hengshan County (at that time, no one knew the source of the disease, so it was generally called by this name). The entire family of a certain surname, eleven in total, except for the daughter-in-law who was not harmed because she returned to Ning, all died within three days. A doctor who died along with them and four people who carried the corpses for burial. From then on, people died from strange diseases from time to time in the area around Shiwanzhen. Rumors spread everywhere. By the spring of 1929, more than 700 young farmers had died one after another in more than 30 villages near Yushuping Nangoucha in the northern district of Anding County, more than 20 villages in the Laojundianchuan in the Qingrun northern district, and more than 40 villages in the southwestern district of Hengshan. Moreover, most of them died in the wild. When they were working in the fields, they suddenly felt dizzy, nauseous, and vomited several times. After vomiting yellow water, they died holding the plow. Those who were lighter would die in two or three days. Moreover, if one person died in a certain village, there would rarely be anyone spared. For a time, farmers stopped their work, merchants closed their doors, and schools were dissolved invisibly. In the past two years, the disease area has gradually expanded, and the number of deaths has increased. However, the symptoms are slightly different from before. Those in the Yan'an Dingbian area vomited black water due to dizziness and abdominal pain. Those in the Anding Hengshan area had carbuncles suddenly rising on the neck or legs. They were as small as rice grains in the morning, and as large as fists in the evening. They spread throughout the body within three to five days, ulcerated and died. There were also countless small red grains rising on the chest, spreading after one or two days, leading to death. In the various counties of Sui, Mi, Yu, Jia, and Wu, most people died due to dizziness, cold limbs, and vomiting yellow water or white phlegm. This year, the garrison in Yan'an City carried and buried at least three or four soldiers who died every day in March and April, and even dozens of people died in one day. More than 20 nearby villages were also affected by Yan. The number of deaths in Anding was several times greater than in the past. From Wujiazhai in the eastern district to Jiaojiebao, 242 villages in the middle were spared, especially villages such as Jianjiaping and Yangjiayuanzi in Danzhou, which were almost wiped out. In the northern district, in addition to the 160 villages from Yushuping to Nangoucha, the county seat has recently been affected. Although the entire county has the name of opening school, there is no actual class. The third elementary school in the township has not yet opened due to the severe epidemic in the vicinity. In various towns in the territory, merchants have stopped operating, and workers have stopped working. Yongping Town in the western district of Yanchuan has also been infected. Hengshan spread from south to east, to the west of Suide, and the southwest of Mizhi. The west spread to Anbianbao. In addition to the severe plague in the four townships, the county seat has recently been affected. Du Hongxun, a student at Peking University who returned home for the summer vacation, also died of the plague. Traffic in northern Shaanxi has been cut off. It spread from the west, directly through the county seat to the northeast of Jia County, and then eastward through the northwest of Wubao County to Zaolinping and Dingxianyan in southeastern Suide. The western district of Suide is the richest area in the production of artificial salt and coal, and the population density is the highest in northern Shaanxi. When the plague spread, the number of deaths was several times higher than in other places. The villages in the southern part of Yulin, where it borders Hengshan and Mizhi, were also infected. In summary, the area of ​​more than a dozen counties in the territory of Fuyan, Sui, Mi, Jia, Yu, Heng, Jing, Ding, Qing and An in northern Shaanxi, more than a thousand li from east to west and more than 800 li from north to south, is almost completely poisoned. The number of deaths in each county averages at least more than 600 people. The government has no epidemic prevention agencies, and the people do not know to seek medical treatment. They only know to pray to gods and ask for divination, sitting and waiting for death.</p>

<p>Yongyu Silk Factory to Resume Work Soon Zhu Zhuxian, the manager of the Yongyu Silk Factory outside the South Gate of Yangyaowan in our county, still did not resume work after receiving 38,400 yuan in public bonds. He also claimed that Qian Fenghao, the chairman of the Silk Factory Trade Association, had withheld the loan and pledge, etc. However, the workers' lives were in panic. Hui Jizhi, the chairman of the Industry and Trade Union Federation of the Silk Factory, repeatedly petitioned the county government to quickly summon the responsible parties of both parties and local impartial people to meet as soon as possible to jointly produce relief measures. After Chen County Magistrate received the petition, he specially convened a conciliation meeting yesterday. Those who attended were Wang Kaiwei, Qian Fenghao, Hu Zhongming, Hui Jizhi, etc. Chen County Magistrate presided over the meeting. First, Hui Jizhi and others reported one after another. After Chen County Magistrate summarized the opinions of the representatives into two points: (1) Labor and capital should abide by the law and should start work so that the lives of the workers can be maintained and the industry of the factory will not be affected. (2) Regarding the debt, the factory has contractual restrictions on its dealings with various money shops, so it should naturally perform according to the contract. After discussion, it was resolved that the Ruichangrun bill with a face value of 12,800 yuan would still be used as debt and handed over to Yongyu. Yang Hanxi and Zhang Zhiqin were still requested to guarantee it. Another 10,000 yuan will be lent by Qian Fenghao for 5,000 yuan and Cai Yourong for 5,000 yuan. At this point, a dispute was resolved and work can be resumed soon.</p>

Later, the Ministry sent a telegram, proposing to implement cooperation. The provincial side drafted a plan, the content of which was that the Shanghai side's operating income would go to the Ministry, and the Zhejiang side's income would go to the province. The plan was taken to Beijing in August, and the response was quite supportive. However, two months have passed without any news. The cooperation problem is now completely suspended.

He secretly swallowed several coins' worth of opium outside. He returned home at 10 p.m., became poisoned, and collapsed in bed, soon dying. The Hangzhou District Court has been notified to send personnel for inspection.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Translation of Key Points from the Secret Meeting Record on Upholding Japan's Rights and Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia (Continued from the 9th)</h3>
<p>Although our country's special position in Manchuria and Mongolia was obtained from the Russo-Japanese War, many vested rights were obtained during the Zhang Zuolin era. Zhang Xueliang dared to break away from the warlord nature and sacrifice his special regime, returning it to Nanjing, in order to avoid his major responsibilities to us. This is not only building high fortresses for self-defense but also releasing diplomatic toxic gas throughout East Asia, intending to poison the life of our Japan... It is truly an unprecedented masterpiece. If Chiang Kai-shek is said to be a treacherous and terrible hero, then Zhang Xueliang's insidiousness towards our policies is even more terrible. In the past, the Empire... because the European and American powers had not yet felt the importance of China, and the sea ban had not yet been fully opened, their people's knowledge of China was very shallow. Therefore, on the one hand, they attacked China using the strategy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" and "befriending distant states and attacking neighboring ones," while on the other hand, they learned their methods and used them in reverse. As a result, countries around the world fell for their propaganda and sang the principle of international cooperation to investigate China. During this period of international cooperation... European and American countries were no less than plainclothes teams for the Empire in China... However, today the sea ban is fully open, and European and American countries' production must seek sales in China, thus giving rise to pro-China sentiments. Moreover, recently the Chinese people, regardless of North or South, have become very awakened, especially their diplomatic strategies are very developed. They tirelessly engage in propaganda to Europe and America, often boldly opposing and correcting our country's slanders. Therefore, European and American people's understanding of China has increased several times... Moreover, the things that our country previously exploited from China using international coordination have subsequently aroused suspicion from various countries... Therefore, the cunning United States took advantage of the Washington Conference to break through our country's special rights in Manchuria and Mongolia in one fell swoop, and bound our actions with the Nine-Power Treaty. Then, with the combined power of British and American forces, they overturned the usual practice of international cooperation diplomacy in China, wanting to trap the Empire in isolation... Also, the dispatched diplomacy, although still based on the core principles of "befriending distant states and attacking neighboring ones" and "using barbarians to control barbarians," is useless as the resources of Manchuria and Mongolia are abundant, and European and American powers are coveting them. No matter how much our Japan shouts out the strategies of the Feng faction, they will inevitably flock to where the interests lie. Moreover, the current cooperation between Britain and America aims to eliminate the Empire's power in China. Their Feng faction's diplomatic tactics are precisely in line with their ambitions... We must believe that British and American capital imperialism definitely has the possibility of cooperating with the Feng faction to the end. If so... Britain and America will become the Feng faction's plainclothes team, jointly using the diplomatic tactics of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to control us, while they can sit back and enjoy the preferential treatment of China's policy of "befriending distant states and attacking neighboring ones."</p>
<p>I, in my post, together with Consul General Lin and the Commander of the Kwantung Government-General, have studied repeatedly and found the following diplomatic strategies, which must be used continuously, in order to preserve the core of our Manchuria and Mongolia policy without being overthrown: (1) "Using Chinese to control Chinese," using their internal sentiments, opposition factions, and bandit gangs to disrupt their regime, thereby restraining their diplomacy towards us and causing European and American countries to feel apprehensive about investing in Manchuria and Mongolia. (2) "Kindness and威" On one hand, we provide benefits for the progress of various projects, and on the other hand, we use this to exercise authority. (3) "Pro-China and惡" In the spiritual aspect, we use goodwill and equality as the superficial principles, while secretly implementing other damaging and destructive strategies. (4) For existing outstanding issues and unrealized vested rights, we use the "coexistence and co-prosperity" and "joint venture" nature as the superficial solution, but in reality, the key is still to obtain and retain special rights. (5) The diplomatic power of Manchuria and Mongolia should still be the responsibility of Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>Of the two major trunk lines of the Feng faction's railway network, the eastern line, Feng-Hai Railway, has already reached Jilin. It is difficult for the Empire to stop its realization, so we might as well do it as a favor, but persuade them to allow us to build the Ji-Hui Railway. We would not hesitate to give them the entire Tian-Tu Railway free of charge. The distribution center of Manchuria and Mongolia's specialties and resources, although the eastern part has a considerable amount, but compared with the western part of Heilongjiang and Mongolia, its land is more fertile and its area is larger. The development of western transportation can make Huludao prosper. Therefore, the completion of the western line is a fatal blow to our Manchuria and Mongolia policy... Fortunately, the section between Tongliao and Taonan has not yet been built. The Empire must take this opportunity to stop it, as well as the line between Taonan and Kailu. If Zhang Xueliang agrees to us, the Empire can stop building the Da-Lai Railway as an exchange condition... Furthermore, take this opportunity to advocate the false spirit of "coexistence and co-prosperity," induce them to agree with us on railway freight rates and cargo and passenger absorption areas. If not, the Empire can induce them with the theme of allowing Chinese investment and merging with our South Manchuria Railway. Zhang Xueliang will inevitably fall into the trap. If he still uses the excuse that diplomatic power has been merged into Nanjing to refuse negotiations, the Empire will advise him to exert his personality on the grounds that all vested rights were obtained during the Zhang Zuolin era, and that the location is under his jurisdiction, and negotiate with Nanjing on behalf of the Empire. We firmly believe that Zhang Xueliang will have no way to escape his responsibility, avoiding the Empire's direct negotiation with Nanjing and creating the custom of Manchuria and Mongolia diplomacy being merged into Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Empire's special position in Manchuria and Mongolia is ensured because the Northeast commander has special political power. This can be understood clearly if we examine the era before Zhang Zuolin entered the Pass. After Zhang Zuolin entered the Pass, the Empire's position was shaken. Fortunately, Zhang Zuolin's ambition was focused on unifying the Central Plains, and he dared not take any blatant action regarding our special rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. However, at this point, the Empire increasingly felt that the position of Manchuria and Mongolia must be determined as soon as possible. If China's unification is realized, our position will inevitably be overthrown. In addition, the revolutionary forces are growing stronger, and British and American surveillance is becoming more strict. The Empire's crisis is imminent. At that time, Foreign Minister Tanaka consulted with relevant government offices, taking advantage of the Northern Expedition opportunity of the Revolutionary Army, using the strategy of "using Chinese to control Chinese," and bombing Zhang Zuolin, wanting the restoration faction to seize Manchuria and Mongolia. When they saw that the situation was unfavorable, they turned to advising Zhang Xueliang to be independent, with nothing more than wanting to ensure the Empire's position in Manchuria and Mongolia. The sluggishness of the South Manchuria Railway's business is at its extreme today. However, if calculated proportionally according to its revenue and mileage, I am afraid that no well-performing railway in our country can surpass it. Its length is only seven or eight hundred miles, and its average income in the past few years is truly unprecedented and unheard of in our transportation history... Since this year (referring to the 19th year of the Republic of China), due to the changes in the world economy and the decline in the price of Chinese silver... the South Manchuria Railway's business has been severely affected. The authorities have spared no effort to overcome all difficulties in order to absorb local specialties, or to use carts and horses as intermediaries for collecting goods, or to reduce port fees and drinking water fees, etc., or to provide low-interest financing to various specialty traders through banking institutions, or to secretly reduce freight rates, or to set up warehouses everywhere regardless of profits through directly operating international transportation companies, reducing their rents, and providing various conveniences to cargo owners, etc. This is enough to prove that the Manchuria Railway authorities are truly operating miserably and fighting hard to increase revenue. However, the great nature of the world's economic downturn is beyond human power to reverse... Therefore, people generally misunderstand the Manchuria Railway authorities as incompetent, leading to their golden prosperity being broken by the Feng faction's railway network encirclement policy, etc., which is a fallacy based on their lack of international understanding and ignorance of the plight of the world's economic downturn... The world often uses the income of the golden Manchuria Railway era as the standard, but they do not know... that the world's economic downturn is precisely a reflection of the golden age. If the Manchuria Railway's revenue has decreased due to encirclement, then why has the revenue decrease of the roads surrounding the Manchuria Railway, such as the Shen-Hai, Ji-Hai, Ji-Chang, Ji-Dun, Si-Tao, Tao-Ang, Qi-Ke-Hu-Hai, Da-Tong, etc., been even more severe? Now, the salaries of their employees have been in arrears for several months. Therefore, the economy of the Manchuria Railway still has a very large surplus compared to this, and its foundation has not been shaken by the revenue decrease.</p>
<p>The Fushun Coal Mine. The fact is well known to you all. The mine is owned by China. The Empire only takes its income and mining rights. However, our country cannot extract much at one time, and the Chinese side cannot sell much either. There is no opportunity to mine it all at once to increase the wealth of the Empire. The amount of coal buried in the mine is a total of 1.7 billion tons. The publicly announced amount is 1.3 billion tons. The Manchuria Railway has been working hard to mine it for more than 20 years, and has mined a total of 470 million tons. The publicly announced amount is 330 million tons. According to the amount stored, it is very rich. Although the Manchuria Railway wants to vigorously mine it, the sales channels have been greatly affected after the world economy declined. (According to the railway revenue reduction alone, from April to November it was 28,555,000 yen)</p>
<p>Forty special investigators from the Manchuria Railway went to the Feng faction's railway lines to investigate their revenue situation. They were shocked to learn that the Feng faction's railway economy was extremely impoverished. This is all because the Feng faction's transportation authorities have no international economic vision and have abused their official power to manipulate their financial policies and challenge our Manchuria Railway. This is also a deserved punishment. As for using inconvertible banknotes to forcibly buy local specialties from the people to make huge profits... It only makes the people extremely exhausted and does not care... It is clear that it has no staying power. If we can be patient and wait, the power of their railway network can be broken without attack. Thus, the Feng faction's railway's rapid advance, its impact on our South Manchuria Railway's focus, is not today but in the future, that is, the day the east-west trunk line is completed. The food salt of the East Three Provinces Salt Affairs Bureau. According to the treaty of July 28th, Meiji 41st year, our South Manchuria Railway has the special right to transport this official salt. Also, according to Article 4 of the appendix, if you want to abolish this treaty, you must notify the South Manchuria Railway three months in advance. However, the Chinese side did not notify in advance... and handed over all transportation to their railway network... The Manchuria Railway suffered a great loss of income as a result. Moreover, our country has promoted to various countries that if the Chinese people in Manchuria and Mongolia do not rely on the convenience of our Manchuria Railway's transportation, their lives and culture will be threatened. However, because of the seizure of this official salt transportation, it is no longer reasonable to speak of it. It has made our Manchuria Railway, which was a transportation for coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries, become a transportation of imperialism... Therefore, the authorities are very eager to regain this right... Although they are afraid of arousing the Chinese people's resentment, they have hesitated to implement it, but they are constantly waiting for the opportunity to restore this honorary mask. Even if the freight rate is reduced to lower than the Feng faction's railway, the Manchuria Railway would be happy to do so, and it would not hesitate to sacrifice a part of it if it is absolutely necessary... This problem may be resolved through railway negotiations, which would be very fortunate. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation and Adult Education</h3>
<p>Wu Zengjie</p>
<p>At a time when the Japanese invaders are occupying our country's land and the whole country is indignant, it seems too far-fetched to raise the issue of adult education. In fact, from this serious and critical event, we have indeed received a strong stimulus, calling us to not only pay attention to "adult education" but also to make a determination and do it practically. I have many thoughts about adult education because I participated in propaganda work this time, so I especially publish them for the discussion of colleagues in the education field.</p>
<p>Everyone already knows that none of the advanced countries in the world do not pay attention to the construction of education, and universal education has been realized. Our enemy, Japan, according to the latest statistical report from the Ministry of Education, the percentage of educated and uneducated people in the country is 99.5, that is to say, out of a hundred people, only half a person is illiterate. The most widely sold newspaper in their country sells more than 1.2 million copies every day. From this fact, it can be proved that the number of literate people is large. The number of literate people in our country is only 20 percent, which is really a world of difference compared to them. Adult education and the mass movement are closely related, because the mass movement must have considerable training, and the method of training is education. China is a China of 400 million compatriots. Now that the country is in trouble, only a small number of intellectuals are running around and calling out, and most people are still confused. I previously led a group of students to the suburbs of Suzhou Loumen City to give speeches and perform disguised performances. Most of the audience were villagers. The speakers were exhausted, but the audience still did not understand. You and him, talk about "China", "Japan", "Shenyang", "Wanbaoshan", they have no impression in their minds. They only know his village, his parents, brothers and sisters, and relatives, and do not know what is called "country," nor what is called "China," nor what is called "Japan." I once asked a woman, "Where are you from?" She said, "I am from Loumen." I asked again, "Do you know that you are from Suzhou?" She shook her head and said, "I don't know." You think she doesn't even know that she is from Suzhou, so how can she know that she is Chinese? This time's speech, although trying to make the words simple and popular, ultimately failed to arouse the audience's response.</p>
<p>If we want the people to exercise their civil rights and participate in politics, we must first make them interested in politics. If we want them to be interested in politics, we must make them pay attention to current affairs. Therefore, the general public, at least to a limited extent, must be able to read newspapers and know the situation in the country. Then, when the national crisis comes, they can rise up together. Under the leadership of the government, participate in the mass movement. To make the people rise up together and participate in the mass movement, we must implement adult education. The methods can be listed as the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The state formulates a law on compulsory adult education. All adults who are old and out of school must enter public schools. Those who disobey will be severely punished. (2) All urban elementary schools and rural elementary schools should open adult classes. Nearby residents can enroll nearby.</p>
<p>(3) All social education institutions, such as farmers' education centers and public education centers, are responsible for guiding the implementation of adult education majors under the orders of ten-level institutions.</p>
<p>(4) Classes should be held for at least two hours a day, after work hours.</p>
<p>Adult education is an urgent matter. Now many elementary schools have attached public night schools, and teachers have worked hard to persuade adults to enroll. However, in fact, very few people enter school. They come when they are happy today, and they don't come when they are not happy tomorrow. Often, it is lively at the beginning, but later it becomes listless and depressed. Especially women, they simply regard going to school as shameful. No matter how you publicize and give preferential treatment, they always stop. Ask yourself, in this case, where will adult education be effective? Therefore, according to personal opinion, if you want the people to pay attention to national affairs and shoulder national responsibilities, you must implement adult education, and this education must be compulsory. Except for the old, disabled, and mentally ill, all other illiterate people must enter public schools.</p>
<p>Similar to the nature of adult education is the remedial education prevalent in European and American countries. Its purpose is to enable the general public to acquire knowledge and skills in their spare time, to supplement the lack of occupation, and to receive further training. What our country urgently needs at present is compulsory adult education. The first step is to enable the elderly and out-of-school people to be able to recognize words and read newspapers. After education is popularized, then implement remedial education.</p>
<p>As important as adult education is compulsory education. But I think that, given the current situation, the importance of adult education is still above compulsory education. Because children are the masters of the future, and adults are the masters of the country now. If we do not educate the current masters, isn't it very dangerous?</p>
<p>The people of the country have risen up to resist Japanese imperialism. This is really a manifestation of the spirit of unity. But we cannot put the vast majority of uneducated and ignorant compatriots out of our minds. They should be given a considerable education, and then they will respond to every call and go to the national crisis together. Of course, the method of saving the country is not just education, but adult education is indeed the most important plan today. I hope that the education administrative organs and colleagues in the education field will work together. (Suzhou Women's Middle School)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Care for Student Delegation Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>Delegation Decides to Petition in the Capital Today</p>
<p>丨Yesterday Afternoon's Reception for the Press丨</p>
<p>丨Report on the Journey from Japan Back to the Country丨</p>
<p>Since the student delegation returning from Japan, numbering over twenty, arrived in Shanghai, they have been contacting various parties for accommodation and preparing to petition the National Government and the Ministry of Education in the capital. The Mayor of Shanghai, Zhang Yuejun, received the representatives the day before yesterday and promised to help with accommodation and meals. He also telegraphed the Ministry of Education to facilitate the delegation's journey to the capital. In response to the telegram, the Ministry of Education immediately dispatched two officials, Councilor Zhu and Inspector Lin, to Shanghai to care for the delegation's accommodation, meals, and petition. Councilor Zhu and Inspector Lin departed from the capital by train at 4:00 PM yesterday after receiving their orders. The Ministry of Education also sent a telegram to notify the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. Upon receiving the telegram, the Municipal Bureau of Education dispatched Inspector Li to the delegation's office at the Ping'an Hotel on Zhu Bao San Road to provide advance notice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the student delegation returning from Japan originally planned to petition the National Government and the Ministry of Education in the capital last night. Afterwards, as a result of representative Cao Xiuxian's petition to Mayor Zhang Yuejun, the Mayor approved a reply before 10:00 AM this morning regarding free train tickets and promised to help with accommodation and meals in Shanghai. Subsequently, the delegation decided to depart for the capital at 10:00 AM today. At 1:00 PM yesterday, they held a reception for the press in the meeting room of the YMCA on Sichuan Road to report on their journey from Japan back to the country and the outline of their future work. Details of their report are recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Working Situation in Japan: All the more than 2,000 students in Japan were filled with grief and indignation upon hearing the news of the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast. On September 29th, at 10:00 AM, they went to the Chinese Embassy in Japan to petition. The main points of the petition were four: (1) Lower the flag and return to the country; (2) Sever diplomatic relations with Japan; (3) Declare war on Japan; (4) Issue ship tickets to all students returning from Japan. Ambassador Jiang replied that the first three items required instructions from the Central Government. The issuing of ship tickets could be accepted, and a reply would be given in three days. On October 1st, they went to the Embassy again to request instructions. They then heard that the Central Government had telegraphed that it was unnecessary for students in Japan to return to the country. The students stood in the rain for ten hours, insisting that 150 ship tickets be issued. After deliberation, it was decided to send 20 representatives to return to the country first, to petition the National Government and request assistance from all sectors of the country for the return of all students in Japan. The purpose of this delegation's petition to the capital is: (1) To oppose the policy of non-resistance and request the government to immediately declare war on Japan and recover lost territory; (2) To oppose the suppression of the people's anti-Japanese and national salvation movement; (3) To promote peaceful unification; (4) To request severe punishment for the traitors who presided over the Northeast independence movement; (5) To promptly abolish all unequal treaties; (6) To implement a strong foreign policy; (7) To request the government to make every effort to protect overseas Chinese in Japan; (8) To request the Ministry of Education to issue a circular to all provincial governments to provide travel expenses for all students returning from Japan; (9) To request the Ministry of Education to accommodate students returning from Japan; (10) To request the Ministry of Education to issue a circular to all provincial governments to transfer government-funded students in Japan to other countries to continue their studies after the completion of the anti-Japanese and national salvation work; (11) After the completion of the anti-Japanese work, students in Japan who wish to attend national universities should be allowed to enroll without examination and fees; (12) The registry of returning students in Japan should be retained by the supervisory office. (B) Outline of Work After Returning to the Country: (1) Registration of students returning from Japan has begun, and students returning from Japan who are currently serving in various sectors are also expected to register to achieve unity; (2) Students returning from Japan are willing to enlist in the volunteer army; (3) Students returning from Japan are willing to work to organize the masses; (4) In order to awaken the people and help establish a foreign policy towards Japan: 1. Establish a Japanese Research Association; 2. Publish research findings on Japan in journals; 3. Organize a propaganda team to awaken the national masses to unite against Japan. (C) The reasons for Japan's dispatch of troops to the Three Eastern Provinces can be divided into economic and political reasons. Economic aspects: (1) Japan's economic crisis; (2) Japan's financial exhaustion; (3) Conflict between Japanese and American investment; (4) Active construction in the Northeast. Political aspects: (1) The rise of nationalist groups. Recently, three new nationalist political parties have been established in Japan: 1. The Greater Japan Production Party; 2. The Patriotic Society; 3. The National Essence Society, which are working hard to advocate aggression against China; (2) Occupying China as a base for the outbreak of a world war; (3) The tyranny of the warlords and their ambitions; (4) The life of political parties and the expansion of colonies. The competition among Japanese political parties for power is entirely based on the invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia as their main task. The Minseito and Seiyukai parties, etc., only differ in their means of aggression, whether by military force or economic means. (D) A Glimpse of the National Conditions of Japan: After decades of painstaking efforts since the Meiji Restoration, Japan harbors great ambitions towards China and the world. The domestic situation includes: (1) Cultural aspects; (2) School aspects; (3) Economic aspects; and so on.</p>

<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, for the past two days, we have almost held our breath, waiting for good news from the League of Nations. In everyone's mind, the League of Nations is simply regarded as our savior, eliminating disasters and prolonging life. We rely entirely on the power and compassion of the Bodhisattva. But while we hope, we must not over-rely on the Bodhisattva. We must know that the Bodhisattva is sometimes afraid of evil ghosts and cannot protect us. Therefore, while hoping, we must also do our best to make all preparations. The peaceful reunification of the country is urgent and cannot be delayed. And the final struggle is by no means just posting slogans and holding meetings. We must rely on the strength of the whole country to seek a way out of the dead end.</p>
<p>Do Not Remove the Courtyard Grass Zhaifu Tan Hui</p>
<h3>Listening to Boxing</h3>
<p>I have seen and heard Westerners fighting once, and it is particularly interesting. In the autumn of 1914, when Japan was attacking Qingdao, my ship left Yokohama for Honolulu. Suddenly, I heard ping pong pang pang... in the smoking room. I didn't know what was going on. When I walked to the door, I saw two Westerners, one leg, fighting there. What I found most strange at the time was that they didn't say a word or make a sound. Because all I had seen before was people from my hometown fighting, and there were shouts, curses, challenges, and curses before and after the fight. Now, seeing Westerners fighting silently, I had never seen it before. I was simply stunned. At first, I thought they were fighting for fun, but they were fighting so hard, so seriously, and so desperately, it was definitely not a game. After a while, one of them stopped fighting back, and the other also stopped attacking. This kind of unspoken peace is also rare. Two years later, I went to visit an American classmate and heard ping pong pang pang sounds in his room. I stopped and listened quietly. It was indeed the same sound I heard on the ship - the echo of fists hitting flesh. I immediately knocked on the door hard. It seemed that the sound of knocking on the door immediately stopped the battle, because the dong dong of the door was no longer ping pong. When my friend opened the door and greeted me, a flash of anger on his face turned into a smile. His wife, hearing that I had come, also came to the living room to meet me. Everything was as usual, except that her hair was a little messy. My friend was being outrageous that day, because beating his wife is a very disgraceful thing in America. What surprised me was that people in my hometown like to beat their wives in front of people, while Westerners stop when they see people coming, and the wife doesn't cry for help when she is beaten. Okay, I wrote this story without any other hope. My little wish is:</p>
<p>"Both ears have washed with clear water,</p>
<p>From now on, I love to hear the sound of fists.</p>
<p>Ha! You are wrong, sir. Listening to fists is not as good as</p>
<p>Boxing, and boxing is not as good as using fists!"</p>
<h3>Suicide is Not Saving the Country</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The other day, I saw in this newspaper that Kang Baosen took a Mauser pistol and shot himself in the head, causing brain blood to flow. At the No. 1 ferry terminal of the new customs wharf on Hankou Road in this city, there was also a middle-aged man among the passengers who suddenly jumped into the river and drowned himself. He joined the water spirits. Kang left behind three notes. (1) He lamented that the country was about to perish and urged the people to work hard to save themselves. (2) He ordered that the clothes he left behind after his death be sold and all the money be used as a fund for anti-Japanese national salvation. (3) He wrote down the contact address of his family. It was purely because he was severely stimulated by the Japanese army's invasion of the Northeast that he committed suicide. The passenger on the No. 1 ferry, although his name is unknown, also left behind a newspaper, an alarm about the Japanese invasion, and a letter, on which was written "Please notify Zhao Yuncan at No. 13, Xiangshun Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei," etc. The suicide note said that now that the country is in trouble, he himself has no ability to save the country and is a useless citizen. He also committed suicide out of anger and indignation. It is also sad.</p>
<p>However, can suicide be done by those who are keen on saving the country today? Who is not saddened by the continuous failure of national affairs? Twenty years ago, there were those who drank their swords and plunged into the sea, but it did not help the decline of the country's power. At least there were those who cut off their fingers, fasted, and vomited blood. Those who heard it were not always aroused with generosity and acted quickly. But before long, they forgot about it. Why? This is all temporary false pride, and the dead die in vain. The living pass the time and change the environment, and there is no continuity after them. In the end, the living cannot face the dead in the ground, and the dead will never help the country's future. Can they rest in peace? I do not know that those who commit suicide have blood and thoughts. It must be known that since Heaven has endowed them with blood and thoughts, then their being human must be different from the mediocre. The so-called death is heavier than Mount Tai, lighter than a feather, and it is known that it has always been the case. Therefore, to pledge the death of one man to exchange for the life of all, suicide is acceptable. To donate the life of one person and listen to the death of all, suicide is unacceptable. Being ignorant of this distinction is the same as our country's life. Today, the neighboring country has not yet cut off our breath, but we have cut it off first. Today, one more person commits suicide, and tomorrow there will be one less pillar to support the crisis. What the enemy fears and fears is that there are still people in China, not that we can commit suicide to the point of exhaustion. If we have this body, as long as there is a breath, the country can be protected and the hatred can be avenged. Those who are superior are like Wu Hou, who devoted himself to his work until his death. He will not rest until he has conquered Wei. The next best are like Yu Rang, who painted his body and swallowed charcoal. He will not stop until he has avenged the police. Otherwise, suicide is really applauded and sneered at by the violent sun. I do not know what to take.</p>
<p>When the people of Japan destroyed Korea in the past, at first, Min committed suicide when he heard of the change. Then the ministers also committed suicide with him. In the end, it did not harm Japan, nor did it help Korea. This is suicide that does not care about the life of the country, but only loses one's own life. If we had known that suicide was meaningless, we would have tasted bitterness and hardship, and slept on firewood and tasted gall. The sages of the past have told me. If we can find a way to repay, then even if we exhaust our hair to provide sacrifices for the country, and share the same end with the hatred of our country, why wait to hesitate? This must not be unknown. I am unwilling to speak for those who cherish life, but I grieve for those who commit suicide and waste their lives. Therefore, I wrote this article to correct it. Otherwise, those who fear the head and fear the tail, who are afraid of death and have no time to survive, are the criminals of Kang Baosen and the ferry passengers, and they are not the ones I mention.</p>
<h3>Heroes and Leaders</h3>
<p>— Tang Chengxin</p>
<p>Foreign disasters are approaching day by day, which is not without reason. It is because of the frequent domestic unrest, the poverty of the people, and the fatigue of the country that they have greatly moved their index fingers and suddenly developed the idea of ​​coveting. And a study of the causes of domestic unrest in our country in the past 20 years is all due to the so-called big figures' dreams of heroes and the desire for leadership being too great. Therefore, those who are slightly talented all want to show their talents in order to despise the world. There are also some speculators who add fuel to the fire and increase their flames. They say that this is the ambition of a hero. This is what a leader should do. I do not know that the number of heroes and leaders is increasing day by day, and national affairs are becoming more and more wrong because of this. The vitality of the country is being destroyed, and the people are being devastated. It is nothing more than an unnecessary sacrifice for those who claim to be heroes and leaders. Alas. Is this possible? The country is not worried about the people's enthusiasm for heroes and leaders. It is worried that the followers who are enthusiastic about heroes and leaders only take the political stage as their only purpose and are unwilling to devote their talents to science or industry. Therefore, they fight each other every day, and the national economy and the people's livelihood are shrinking day by day. The country is about to fall into a state of eternal destruction. This is why the British Confucian Russell has the theory that "the desire to possess is not necessary, but the desire to create is indispensable." The scientists and industrialists of Europe and the United States are often worshiped by people, and they are all recorded in history and admired by the world. Alas. The heroes and leaders of our country? Why do you not plan this and plan that?</p>
<h3>National Crisis Poetry Talk</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded our borders, killing our compatriots with unprecedented cruelty and barbarity, patriotic youths have either volunteered to face the danger or rushed about shouting for action. But ordinary people who care about the times, though ambitious and armed with righteous indignation, have no way to serve their country. They then express themselves through poetry to encourage the nation. Among them are many impassioned and stirring verses, enough to warn the world. I have collected a few of them to make a poetic commentary, which can also show a glimpse of the people's spirit in the midst of national crisis.</p>
<p>My friend, Li Qianlin, graduated from Hangzhou Police Academy. When he was in Hangzhou, we often composed poems together and got along very well. He had the heroic spirit of a young man, no less than that of Yuan Long. His poems and essays were quite readable. This time, angered by the Japanese invasion, he wrote ten poems expressing his feelings. Here are four of them: "Though Chu has only three households, it is enough to destroy Qin; tasting gall should teach one to sleep on firewood. Looking around the Central Plains, I sigh at the sinking land; surely there are those who hear the rooster crow and rise to dance." "Why do brothers quarrel so bitterly? It is shameful to hear of renewing old alliances under the city walls. The officials in the court eat their fill in vain; I ask, who will borrow chopsticks to repel the barbarians?" "The crane cries in Liaodong, tears fill my robe. The general wears his head in vain. Does Lu Yang have the power to turn back the sun?</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Storytelling</h3>
<h3>The Pestle of Knocking Dreams (13)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Madam Tang, a military officer's wife, held a large-scale ceremony to receive her students, expressing her life's first happy event. Inside the house, all the way to the women's hall, everything was wide open. The floor was covered with thick wool, and maids dressed in colorful flowers stood on both sides, from the courtyard to the hall, about thirty to fifty people. In the voices of warbling swallows, they announced, "The new champion of the provincial examination, Tao Chi, is here to see you." Tao Chi entered the hall with his head bowed in the sound of the announcement. Two maids had already laid a red carpet in the center, and Tao Chi respectfully performed the ritual of paying homage to his mentor.</p>
<p>Madam Tang stood up, accepted two bows, and invited this new esteemed student to sit aside. A maid quickly presented a cup of milk tea and a plate of pastries. Madam Tang inquired about his family background, and Tao Chi answered very respectfully. Occasionally, he looked up and saw a charming girl dressed in splendid clothes peeking through an embroidered curtain behind Madam Tang. Tao Chi's eyes met hers, and the embroidered curtain fell gently. This was Miss Tang Xiuying, whom he had once met in the Niangniang Temple.</p>
<p>The story of Tao Chi worshiping a female teacher became a popular tale at the time, in the 18th century, earning him a teasing poem:</p>
<p>|| Teasing Tao Chi ||</p>
<p>Five thousand imperial examinations, but no fame; seeking help from all sides, but no rescue. The poor scholar mistakenly climbed into the official's wife's sedan chair, reaching the military yamen straight to the literary examination shed. Who knew that the top scorer on the list was the one who watched the carriage pass by? Young champion, who can compare to you? Bow to the student behind the bead curtain and silk tent.</p>
<p>Worshiping a female teacher is a good story; worshiping a female teacher and earning this teasing poem is even more so. Who would have thought that the good story at the time did not end there?</p>
<p>"Your son is young and handsome, his future is limitless, and the military officer has endless hopes for him. If he succeeds in the next examination and makes the top ranks, then your son can steadily become the military officer's son-in-law." This was the secret talk when the Prefect of Jinan invited Tao Gongsheng to the office to meet.</p>
<p>"My son, strive hard! Today the Prefect summoned you and said this: if you really get into the top ranks, the Shandong Governor will be your father-in-law. There are golden houses in books, there are thousands of bushels of grain in books, there are beautiful women like jade in books." This was Tao Gongsheng's instruction to his son.</p>

<h3>Large Batch of Long-Term Debt Due News</h3>
<p>Today is the middle of October, which is the deadline for the sixth installment of long-term debt. The number of issues or deposits in the first half of this year in mid-April was very large. Moreover, the amount of deposits held by Yongzhuang agents was also huge. However, during this time of internal disaster and foreign trouble, the future of commerce is unusually sad and difficult. Repaying old debts is a major problem. However, the financial community has long held concerns about the current situation. Although the debt side will exhaust its efforts to remedy the situation, it is impossible to fulfill the wish. Yesterday, according to people in the financial community, the silver money industry intends to either transfer or receive deposits for the large amount of long-term debt due tomorrow, listening to the customer's own convenience, and doing its best to cope. However, given the natural disasters and man-made disasters in the market, it seems difficult to strictly urge lending, and most of them should respond to the facts. If there is indeed confirmed money that is not easy to recover for a while, and those who repay Zhuang money can generally transfer accounts according to the usual practice, and wait for the next session (i.e., the middle of April in the 21st year) to repay. If the individual indebted households have a relationship with their own foundation, they will not be able to cope. In order to avoid danger, it is necessary to find ways to adjust, or be subjected to liquidation or use valuables as collateral. Therefore, most of the debts are bound, and it is estimated that 17 out of 8 transfers. However, the disposal method in each case is mutually different depending on the facts.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rebounded Sharply</h3>
<p>The 20 Customs Consolidated Tax New Good Increased by More Than Three Yuan</p>
<p>The Others Were Also Good at About Two and a Half Yuan, and the Market Situation Was Slightly Better</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th), the bond market situation on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the futures for the November period were still not traded, and the October period also continued to be quiet. There were still many types of spot transactions. Regarding the changes in the prices of various bonds, although the Japanese are still extremely fierce towards us, increasing their troops and sending warships, looking at the international situation, the international community has a slightly better understanding of the situation in the East, and international public opinion sympathizes with us. The diplomatic situation is more favorable than before. If the League of Nations cannot resolve the issue, the United States will hold a Nine-Power Conference. At that time, if the Japanese still disregard justice and judgment, then we will be righteous and righteous in a war. The great powers will definitely not stand idly by and not interfere with force. Therefore, looking at the current domestic and foreign situation, although it is getting more and more serious, the environmental situation is better than before. Moreover, the Guangdong side is sincerely cooperating, and unification is no longer a problem. The hearts of the market people who have been inactive for a long time have turned to the hearts of the market, and the market people have made a turning point, so the selling side's attitude is on the sidelines, and they dare not sell it arbitrarily. Although the large buying households have not had large transactions, the sporadic income is quite lively. The prices of various bonds are seeking more than supply. When the market opened in the morning, they all rebounded, and then they continued to see a step-by-step firm trend, and the rise became more vigorous. As a result, the 20-volume rise reached 3.6 yuan compared to the previous day, the 20 Customs Consolidated Tax in 1919 each rose 3.34 yuan, and the remaining good increased by 2.67 yuan. The entire 6 customs tax also rose by 1.67 yuan. The cover is a huge rebound. Especially looking at the future trend of the securities market, it will still depend on the shift in the diplomatic situation. It is estimated that the total spot成交amount for the whole day was 21,000 yuan, the futures were more than 4.8 million in the morning, and about 3.6 million in the afternoon, totaling more than 8.4 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Sun Qun's Methods to Rescue the Plummeting Public Bonds</h3>
<p>(I) The Total Amount of Losses from the Current Drop in Public Bond Prices: An investigation shows that the National Government has newly issued 22 types of bonds. Besides the Jianghai Customs 2.5 Treasury Bonds and Tianjin Customs 2.5 Treasury Bonds, which have already been repaid with principal and interest, there are 20 types of bonds whose principal and interest have not yet been fully repaid. Among the old government's public bonds, the National Government has acknowledged and is repaying the principal and interest through lottery drawings for three types: the 7-Year Long-Term Bonds, the 6-Year Bonds, and the 7-Year 3% Bonds. It also acknowledges and pays interest on one type: the Spring Festival Treasury Bonds. In total, there are 24 types of new and old bonds. Calculated according to October of this year, the total outstanding principal amounts to 765,388,000 yuan. A list is provided below:</p>
<p>Bond Name	Original Issue Amount	Outstanding Principal	Bond Name	Original Issue Amount	Outstanding Principal</p>
<p>7-Year Long-Term	45,000,000 yuan	29,250,000 yuan	Continued Series	24,000,000 yuan	2,880,000 yuan</p>
<p>6-Year Bonds	54,390,000 yuan	32,630,000 yuan	1898 Customs Bonds	40,000,000 yuan	23,348,000 yuan</p>
<p>7-Year 3% Bonds	13,600,000 yuan	5,440,000 yuan	Disbandment Bonds	70,000,000 yuan	51,800,000 yuan</p>
<p>Spring Festival Treasury Bonds	8,000,000 yuan	8,000,000 yuan	3% Bonds	24,000,000 yuan	14,880,000 yuan</p>
<p>Military Expenditure Bonds	10,000,000 yuan	7,500,000 yuan	1919 Customs Bonds	80,000,000 yuan	66,560,000 yuan</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Public Bonds	38,000,000 yuan	15,200,000 yuan	Rehabilitation Treasury Bonds	50,000,000 yuan	43,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Short-Term Financial Bonds	30,000,000 yuan	23,000,000 yuan	4% Bonds	60,000,000 yuan	54,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Bonds	10,000,000 yuan	7,500,000 yuan	20% Bonds	80,000,000 yuan	74,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>Troop Reduction Bonds	50,000,000 yuan	37,500,000 yuan	Unified Tax Bonds	80,000,000 yuan	76,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Long-Term Financial Bonds	45,000,000 yuan	45,000,000 yuan	Salt Tax Bonds	80,000,000 yuan	78,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>1919 Customs Tax Bonds	20,000,000 yuan	17,000,000 yuan	Disaster Relief Bonds	30,000,000 yuan	29,700,000 yuan</p>
<p>Haihe Public Bonds	4,000,000 yuan	3,000,000 yuan	Total:	985,990,000 yuan	765,388,000 yuan</p>
<p>Continued 2.5% Bonds	40,000,000 yuan	19,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>According to the market prices on October 13th, the 20% Bonds, Unified Tax Bonds, and Salt Tax Bonds have all plummeted to around 45. The Troop Reduction Bonds are also approaching 50 yuan. Considering the average price of all bonds, they have effectively dropped to 55% of their face value. Based on the original face value of 765,388,000 yuan, the total loss amounts to 344,441,460 yuan. This drastic fall in public bond prices is no different from a major earthquake in the financial world. If relief measures are not promptly implemented, the future will be dangerous and unimaginable. Therefore, I am proposing specific relief measures, hoping that the banking sector and the Ministry of Finance will pay special attention to them.</p>
<p>(II) Measures the Banking Sector Should Take to Rescue the Plummeting Public Bond Prices: Currently, the Shanghai banking sector does not have any concrete measures to rescue the plummeting public bond prices. One bank purchases several million in hopes of raising prices, while another takes advantage of the high prices to sell off, aiming to reduce its own risks. Therefore, the results of these efforts often amount to nothing. The reason for this is that they all want to maintain the stability of their own bank, but they do not realize the importance of maintaining the stability of all banks. It is essential to understand that in today's situation, the isolated policy of one bank cannot ensure its own survival. It is necessary to adopt a spirit of cooperation and seek to weather the storm together in order to revive the situation and rescue the financial crisis. Before the Japanese army withdraws and the political situation stabilizes, it is advisable to adopt a method of cooperative buying and selling. The Shanghai Banking Association should convene a meeting as soon as possible to discuss and establish a covenant for buying and selling bonds. The following points should all be included:</p>
<p>(1) In order to maintain the foundation of the financial sector and prevent fundamental upheavals, all banks should, in the spirit of weathering the storm together, jointly share the responsibility of maintaining the market price of bonds above 60% of their face value.</p>
<p>(2) When bond prices fall below 60% of their face value, each bank should be allocated a percentage of bonds to purchase based on its capital and total amount of fixed deposits.</p>
<p>(3) Each bank should pay the allocated percentage of purchase funds to the Banking Association as a deposit by October 20th.</p>
<p>(4) After receiving these deposits, the Banking Association will represent all banks and begin purchasing until the market price returns to 60%, at which point purchasing will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(5) The purchase prices should be distributed equally among the banks. The banks should not be allowed to choose higher or lower prices based on the time of the sale in order to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>(6) All bonds purchased should be diligently cashed out by the end of the month and temporarily not sold in order to maintain the market price.</p>
<p>(7) All spot goods already purchased and stored by each bank, as well as bonds held as collateral reserves, should be temporarily prohibited from being sold, regardless of how much the price rebounds, until the covenant is revoked.</p>
<p>(8) If any bank has unavoidable reasons for selling, it must submit a written explanation to the Banking Association and obtain a sales permit before being allowed to sell.</p>
<p>(9) Banks are not permitted to sell futures contracts at prices below 60%.</p>
<p>(10) The Banking Association should initiate a joint high-level meeting with all silver firms, money shops, and banks that are not members of the Association to discuss upholding the overall situation and unanimously abiding by the covenant to jointly maintain the market.</p>
<p>(11) The Shanghai Banking Association should notify the banks in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hankou of this covenant via telegram and request that they convene meetings as soon as possible and implement it within a specified timeframe.</p>
<p>(12) This covenant shall be temporarily effective until the political situation stabilizes and the Japanese army withdraws.</p>
<p>(13) Individuals who sell above 60% should naturally be allowed to do so freely. Whether individuals who sell below 60% should be required to provide a written explanation and submit it to the securities exchange supervisor for verification before being allowed to sell should be decided through negotiation by the Banking Association.</p>
<p>(14) The Securities Exchange should post the 60% price of various bonds in the Exchange and also abolish the margin requirement of 800 yuan per 10,000 yuan in order to increase the convenience for purchasers.</p>
<p>This covenant is a temporary emergency relief measure. Although it has a restrictive nature, it is indeed necessary to cooperate in maintaining the market price. If it is resolved and announced by the Banking Association, those who sell at low prices will naturally not want to lose a large amount of capital and will let go. Since everyone is jointly maintaining the market, they should do their best to buy in. I fear that the bond prices can soar to above 60% within five days. If the Banking Association seizes the opportunity to buy in, it will be easy to have them rebound to around 70% before the end of this month's settlement period.</p>
<p>(III) Measures the Ministry of Finance Should Take to Rescue the Plummeting Public Bond Prices: The rise and fall of public bonds are related to the social economy and even more so to the people's faith. What can reassure the people's faith and prevent them from having doubts and fears is only the solid and reliable guarantee of the sinking fund and the on-time repayment of monthly principal and interest. In order to achieve this goal, the Ministry of Finance should quickly adopt the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the sinking fund designated for the bonds, it should be publicly announced and vigorously protected. Under any national emergency, its use should be absolutely prohibited. The Legislative Yuan should formulate strict punitive laws for the use of national debt funds in order to demonstrate national credit.</p>
<p>(2) When a certain tax revenue designated as a sinking fund is insufficient to allocate enough funds to repay the due principal and interest due to natural disasters or man-made calamities, the custodian committee may request the Ministry of Finance to allocate the shortfall from other tax revenues before the 25th of each month. If there is a refusal to act, it should be regarded as undermining national credit, and the Control Yuan should be requested to file an impeachment and implement disciplinary action.</p>
<p>(3) Whenever a certain designated tax revenue is insufficient to allocate enough funds to repay the due principal and interest, the custodian committee may recommend a tax collection inspector to conduct an on-site investigation of the actual tax collection situation. If it is proven that it will indeed be insufficient in the future, the Ministry of Finance may be requested to designate another sinking fund and respond with a public announcement within two weeks.</p>
<p>(4) The above measures to protect the sinking fund should be incorporated into the revised Public Debt Law and the Custodian Committee Regulations by the Legislative Yuan with strict provisions. In general, the goal is to move from personal guarantees to legal guarantees so that the public bond sinking fund will not be shaken by changes in the political situation or the replacement of the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>(5) In order to assist the Custodian Committee in exercising its authority, a Fund Supervisory Committee may be established. All banks and individuals who purchase more than 5 million yuan in public bonds or pledge more than 10 million yuan in public bonds may recommend one member to supervise whether the sinking fund is sound. Furthermore, by understanding the true state of the sinking fund, rumors in the market can be stopped and large-scale short selling can be reduced.</p>
<p>(6) The erroneous theory of postponing principal repayment must be severely suppressed, as this theory is sufficient to undermine national credit and disrupt the financial system. If anyone proposes postponing principal repayment, they should be severely criticized, and the Control Yuan should be requested to file an impeachment.</p>
<p>There are several other points that, if implemented, would also be beneficial to the bond market. They are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(7) Announce the lottery drawing dates for the 6-Year and 7-Year 3% Bonds in advance to increase bond credit. The 6-Year Bonds and 7-Year 3% Bonds are public bonds under the old government's restructuring plan. It has been two years since the last lottery drawing for those that have not yet been repaid. The reason for this is that the 5% surplus customs revenue is used to repay foreign debts due to the high gold prices, leaving no surplus. However, the surplus funds after the foreign debts are fully repaid are also a type of customs revenue. If the months and years of budgeting sufficient funds can be estimated and the lottery drawing dates can be announced in advance, it can also boost the bond market's morale and promote a rebound in bond prices.</p>
<p>(8) Announce that disaster relief bonds will definitely not be opened for trading on the market within the first year of issuance. Since disaster relief is a charitable undertaking, the issued disaster relief bonds should be distributed to various provinces and cities, and wealthy households and major philanthropists across the country should be sincerely urged to donate. When all sectors purchase, they should pay according to the regulations of 98% of the face value, so that disaster victims can receive 80 million yuan in benefits. They should not be sold at a discount on the market as in the past. It should also be announced that they will not be opened for trading on the exchange within one year, so that the number of chips on the market will not increase and bond prices can rebound.</p>
<p>(9) The Exchange's Stoppage Method Should Be Corrected. The Exchange's customary practice is to stop trading immediately if the price rises or falls by four yuan per day, collect the margin calls, and then resume trading. However, the stoppage indicates that prices exceeding four yuan in either direction cannot be traded that day. After the stoppage, if there are still transactions within the four-yuan range, they should continue to be traded as usual to prevent manipulation by speculators. If this correction is not made, it is feared that in the future, taking advantage of the market price of selling 10,000 and losing 400 yuan can stop the market at any time to prevent public trading. This is extremely relevant to the drastic fall in the bond market and should be corrected by the Exchange as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(10) When the price of the bond market falls to 50% of its face value, the Exchange should be ordered to stop trading immediately. In various countries, when securities prices fall, the exchange is ordered to stop trading to calm the market turmoil. Our country does not order the exchange to stop trading, but orders that trading be stopped at prices below 50%. Compared to the methods of various countries, this seems to be a compromise. Furthermore, with this method in place, one can confidently purchase when prices fall to 50%, as they cannot fall further. However, transactions above 50% after the stoppage must still be carried out as usual, leaving room for buyers and sellers to maneuver. This method is extremely effective in rescuing the limitless price decline.</p>

<h3>The Yarn, Raw Cotton, and Silk Markets are Plain and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is stable and unremarkable. Customer demand is weak, but inventories are scarce, so there are no changes in spot prices. In the futures market, there are no significant movements from either buyers or sellers. Relatively speaking, the overall trend favors short positions. The power of the sellers is stronger, and the impact of rising U.S. cotton prices is weak. This seems to be the general view.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Initially Firm, Then Weak: The price of 16-count "Ren Zhong" standard yarn was initially vigorous upon opening, fueled by the excitement of sharply rising U.S. cotton prices, but it weakened due to poor market sentiment and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, it rose by only 30-40 "qian." The prices for each month are listed below:</p>
<p>"Ren Zhong" Closing Price Compared to Previous Day	"Ren Zhong" Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>October Front 161.00 Up 30	January Front 159.00 Up 30</p>
<p>November Front 160.70 Up 40	February Front 159.80 Up 30</p>
<p>December Front 159.90 Up 30	March Front 159.60 Up 20</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Still Undeveloped: The spot yarn market is peaceful. Local traders and customers are quietly observing and waiting for changes. Sales prices are also undeveloped. Yesterday's total trading volume in the city was approximately 600-700 bales. Market prices are flat.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>Beware of Reversals</p>
<p>The cotton market, stimulated by U.S. cotton prices, continues to advance. However, whether the U.S. Cotton Cooperative's plan to stockpile another 7 million bales can be realized is met with much doubt by most observers in this city. In the afternoon, news of a sharp drop in New York stocks caused bearish sentiment to intensify in the market, and the opening gap between near-month and far-month contracts gradually widened, indicating an inversion. Commentators said that this is a sign of poor market conditions.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Slightly Strong: The price of Hankou fine cotton standard initially followed the upward trend of foreign cotton, and the momentum was intense. Later, it fell back due to profit-taking by bulls and short-selling by a certain manufacturer. As a result, it was still up 15-40 "qian." The closing prices for each month are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Price Compared to Previous Day	Hankou Standard Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>October Contract 32.20 Up 15	January Contract 32.50 Up 35</p>
<p>November Contract 32.20 Up 25	February Contract 32.30 Up 40</p>
<p>December Contract 32.25 Up 35	March Contract 32.05 Up 35</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: Spot cotton is quite sluggish. There are no signs of activity in either buying or selling. New cotton is arriving from various routes. Except for Yao cotton, which arrives in amounts of several thousand bales per day, the others are as rare as morning stars. The discrepancy between domestic and foreign values is too great, and no one dares to transport it. Yao cotton has a wide sales market and is purchased by merchants along the Yangtze River and in Shantou, Anqing, Guangdong, and other places. Yesterday's factory delivery only included 1,000 bales of "Shenxin" yarn factory's Division "Qu Le Lu Mi De Lin" cotton, priced at 31.3 taels. 3,007 bales of Yao cotton and 212 bales of low-grade cotton were delivered to the factory's wharf.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Continues to Rise by More Than 30 Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton prices were firm due to good news from Liverpool, unfavorable weather, and active buying. Futures rose by 34-39 points, and spot rose by 35 points. English cotton futures rose by 13-14 points, and spot rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 15 points. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 13th):</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to Shanghai Standard</p>
<p>October 615 Up 36 25.50</p>
<p>December 625 Up 34 25.90</p>
<p>January 639 Up 35 26.50</p>
<p>March 656 Up 35 27.20</p>

<p>March 44 Up 14 30.30</p>
<p>Spot 467 Up 18 32.30</p>
<p>Egyptian 725 Up 13 49.90</p>
<p>Grains: The Lower River Rice Market is Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday's rice market remained sluggish. Arrivals are still surging. Recently, new goods from the western routes have appeared on the market, making it difficult to improve market sentiment. Inventories are still high. Sales at each store are scarce. New "Xin Geng" rice and "Bai Ge" rice have each fallen by 3 "jiao." New "Du Yang Jian" rice is also softening. Old goods are falling. The Double Ninth Festival is approaching, and there is slightly more trade in dim sum shops. Prices are stable.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, 70-80 boats arrived. The situation for Changshu and Wuxi old rice remains weak. Merchants from rural villages are still unwilling to buy. Arrivals of new "Xin Geng" rice from Kunshan are slightly being accepted. Prices are soft by 5 "jiao." Sales of South "Bang" rice such as "Zhong Bai Ge" and red rice are scattered and slow. Opening prices are each down 6-7 "jiao." New and old "Du Bu Jian" rice are scarce. Prices are down by half a "jiao." Early and late rice are unremarkable.</p>
<h3>Spot Soybean Oil Surges by 3 "Jiao"</h3>
<p>Futures Soybean Oil Rises by 15 "Qian"</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw excellent buying in this street. Appetite among the "Beiyang" merchants is also strong. However, due to issues such as loading and transportation, they are only entrusting the firms in this street to purchase on their behalf and are not directly purchasing and transporting themselves. However, the market has been squeezed upwards. Foreign firms are also not selling because the production prices are high. As a result, spot soybean oil jumped by 2-3 "jiao." Futures soybean oil rose by 10-15.6 "fen." There were more than 2,000 bales of spot rice, including "Xiao Jiao," "Min Dang," and Saigon, traded in the unified market. 1,200 tons of futures soybean oil were covered. The price of March soybean oil is 5.35 taels, and the near-term price is 5.2 taels. Spot soybean oil is bid up to over 11 yuan, and high-grade Saigon is at 12.45 yuan. Medium and lower grades are all following suit.</p>
<h3>Flour Milling is Active Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month's market saw some domestic merchants taking advantage of the situation to absorb supply due to foreign wheat prices being around 2 "jiao." The current month did not see major movement due to ordinary actual sales. The far months were slightly better than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, factories were still releasing their positions one after another. It seems that national relations between Japan and China have not yet broken down and that the source of foreign wheat is still not in danger. This caused market sentiment to soften again, and everyone released their positions. Counting from the highest price in the morning, there was a decline of 3 "fen." The rise and fall of the next step depends on how the international situation plays out. As a result, the current month declined by 2.25 "li" from the previous day. November fell 2.1 "li." December fell 1.75 "li." January and February fell 1.75 "li." March fell 1.25 "li."</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Falls Heavily</h3>
<p>After the futures wheat market opened yesterday morning, each month's market saw high foreign wheat prices and the frenzy of the previous day's sharp rise, which was caused by the deterioration of relations between China and Japan. Domestic merchants took this opportunity to absorb supply in a big way. Therefore, opening prices for each month were up by 3-5 "fen" or more compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the international situation had eased again. The buying sentiment had quieted down, while the shorts were active again, causing the opening prices for each month to fall step by step. The momentum was also very intense. As a result, the current month fell by 2 "fen" compared to the previous day. November and December fell by 4 "fen." January fell by 5 "fen." February fell by 1 "fen." March fell by 2 "fen."</p>
<p>Metals: Japanese Metal Goods are Being Sealed Up One After Another</p>
<p>Japanese metal goods that are in this city include purple and yellow copper sheets, purple and yellow copper wire, six-foot and seven-foot "Dong Bai" iron, six-foot and seven-foot corrugated iron, No. 10 to No. 20 new lead wire, 6-fen to 6-inch foreign nails, "Black Dragon" brand and "Ship" brand cement, as well as coal shovels, steel essence, alcoholic liquor, and more, amounting to no less than a hundred types. Recently, the rampant behavior of the violent Japanese has become increasingly severe, so the work of resisting by various associations is becoming more intense. Therefore, members of the association are each taking matters into their own hands and sealing up their goods one after another. The investigation shows that more than 4,000 to 5,000 "dan" of metal products have been sealed up. However, each member is still working hard to investigate, fearing that the number of goods sealed up in the future will not stop at this number.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 260 bales of Zhejiang silk will be shipped to the U.S. tomorrow. 11,000 bags of beet sugar and 9,000 bags of wheat flour are being loaded in Xun and Han. 1,300 tons of steel are being shipped from Belgium to Shanghai.</p>
<p>More than 700 pieces of pigments are being shipped from Germany to Shanghai.</p>
<p>3,300 tons of soybeans and sesame seeds are being shipped to the Netherlands and Germany.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Peaceful Unification and Saving the Nation through Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Immediately Telegraphed the Guangdong Representatives to Hasten Here. Chairman Chiang Plans to Come to Shanghai for a Meeting. The Way to Save the Nation Lies Only in Self-Reliance.</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen Mingshu, who is working for peace, returned to Nanjing from Guangdong, the prospects for peace have suddenly become optimistic. According to the request of the Guangdong side, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, and others accompanied Central Committee Member Hu Hanmin by car to Shanghai yesterday morning at 10 a.m. The Guangdong representatives are also expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. At that time, Chairman Chiang also plans to come to Shanghai for a meeting. The realization of peaceful unification is not far off. The situation of Mr. Hu's arrival in Shanghai and his remarks are described below:</p>
<p>Grand Welcome: Yesterday, when various circles heard the news of Mr. Hu's arrival in Shanghai, they all voluntarily prepared to welcome him. Therefore, at about 4 p.m., welcomers arrived at the train station one after another. The Fourth District Party Headquarters and the Lianyi Society even prepared a white cloth banner that read "Welcome Mr. Hu Zhantang," which was extremely eye-catching. There were also dozens of people holding small welcome flags. Mayor Zhang Qun, Chief of Staff Xu Jinyuan of the Garrison Headquarters, National Government Military Counselor Yang Hu, Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, Central Propaganda Minister Liu Luyin, Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, Jinan University President Zheng Hongnian, Mr. Hu's relative by marriage Lin Huanting, and Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Fan Zhengbo, Tan Zhongxian, Li Dachao, and more than 300 others crowded the platform. The general public also stood in front of the station to admire Mr. Hu's demeanor, numbering no less than several hundred. The North Station presented an unprecedented grand occasion. Armed military police maintained order inside and outside the station. However, there was no military band. The Public Concession police also sent Chinese Detective Pan Lianbi, along with detectives, to provide protection.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu Hanmin Arriving in Shanghai for a Photo (Taken by This Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Railway Bureau Pullman Cars: The Railway Bureau was notified by the headquarters beforehand about Mr. Hu's arrival in Shanghai and prepared three Pullman cars, which were attached to the Beijing-Shanghai express train, numbered PC501, PC503, and M1. Mr. Hu, accompanied by his daughter, Ms. Mulan, and granddaughter, rode in one car. Chen, Wu, Zhang, Wang, and Bai Ling rode in two cars.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Boards the Train: The train arrived at the station at 4:50 p.m. Mayor Zhang Qun was the first to board the train to welcome him, followed by Liu Luyin and others. Mayor Zhang then conveyed Mr. Hu's wishes and invited reporters to board the train for a brief conversation with Mr. Hu, which lasted about five minutes. Hu said that he was ill and should not speak too much, so he was hurriedly helped off the train by his daughter. After leaving the station, he took a car to Sun Ke's residence at 10 Moliere Road to rest. Dr. Deng Zhend, chief medical officer of the two railways, accompanied him in the car to Sun's residence.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's Remarks: Mr. Hu wore a "magua" jacket and a long gown, his face was thin, and his hair was already gray. However, he was in high spirits. He shook hands with each welcomer, smiled, and nodded. He was extremely humble. His conversation with the reporters, although brief, was very sincere. The content of the conversation can be divided into four points: (1) The Guangdong peace issue can be realized soon. I telegraphed Mr. Chen Mingshu on the 12th, telling him that I would arrive in Shanghai on the 14th. After arriving in Shanghai, I will personally telegraph Guangdong again, asking comrades Wang, Sun, Li, and others to come to Shanghai for a meeting. I expect them to arrive in Shanghai soon. After meeting, I will accompany them to Nanjing to discuss cooperation methods in detail. (2) When I met Chairman Chiang, Chiang said that when the comrades from Guangdong come to Shanghai, he also plans to come to Shanghai for a meeting. Someone asked Hu when Chiang's telegram would be issued. Hu replied that he had not heard anything. (3) Japan's current invasion is a complete step-by-step process, carried out gradually according to a predetermined plan. Therefore, its attitude is extremely tough. I sincerely hope that the League of Nations can uphold justice, but it is impossible to rely entirely on the League of Nations, and the League of Nations cannot stop its atrocities. The way to save the nation lies only in self-reliance. National unity against foreign aggression is essential. Mr. Hu repeated the phrase "national unity against foreign aggression" several times, indicating the depth of his feelings. He also said that the Central Government has carefully considered plans to deal with Japan, but due to my position, I am unable to disclose anything. (4) My health has not yet recovered. My blood pressure sometimes rises to over 160. The reason is due to excessive thinking and sleepless nights. The doctor ordered me to use my brain less. I will stay in Shanghai for a few days and return to Nanjing as soon as the comrades from Guangdong arrive.</p>
<p>Telegraphing Guangdong: After Mr. Hu arrived at Sun's residence, those who came with him and those who welcomed him continued to arrive one after another. Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, and others had already arrived before Hu. Liu Luyin, Zheng Hongnian, and others were all present. Hu first entered the reception room and exchanged greetings with everyone briefly. Then, he went upstairs and talked with Lin Huanting, Liu Luyin, and others. He immediately drafted a telegram to all the Central Committee members in Guangdong, generally reporting that Hu had arrived in Shanghai safely and asking the Central Committee members in Guangdong to come north immediately to discuss all the concrete measures for peaceful unification.</p>
<h3>Public Welcome: A Grand Occasion (Photographed by This Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Speaks: Mr. Wu Tiecheng, who accompanied Mr. Hu [Hanmin], informed this newspaper yesterday that Mr. Hu's family remains in Beijing and did not come. Mr. Hu intends to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Beijing. Mr. Li Shizeng and others are arriving in Shanghai tonight (i.e., last night). Representatives from Guangdong are expected to arrive in port before the 20th. The purpose of their stay in Shanghai is not to hold a preparatory meeting but rather for meetings and discussions, and so on.</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu Speaks: When this newspaper's reporter inquired of Mr. Chen Mingshu yesterday regarding the date of his assumption of office as the Commander of the Capital Garrison and the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison, he replied that he still needed to consult with various parties and that the date of his assumption of office would be slightly delayed, and so on.</p>
<h3>Army Students Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>Should Enter National Academy for Continued Education</p>
<p>Since the Eastern Incident occurred, Chinese students studying in Japan have been requesting to return to China one after another. The central government, believing that the students should focus on their studies, issued a telegram to prevent this. However, a small number of army students and students from the Chengcheng School returned to Shanghai on their own accord the day before yesterday. Upon learning of this, the Directorate of Military Training sent a telegram to Mayor Zhang yesterday morning. The original telegram is recorded below: To Mayor Zhang of Shanghai: Regarding all army students studying in Japan, this Directorate has ordered that they should focus on their studies in Japan. In case of any unexpected events, they should follow orders. As for officer students who have been ordered to withdraw from school, there is no way to recover the situation. Please take care of them upon their arrival in Beijing and have them enter military academies for continued education. As for those who have not withdrawn from school, instructions have been telegraphed to Minister Jiang and the administrators, ordering them to continue their studies in Japan. As for those who have not yet entered school, efforts will be made to have them enter. As for the Chengcheng School students, who have not been registered with this Directorate and are not army students, there is no way to arrange for their placement. However, those who have already requested leave to return to China should be instructed to extend their leave with the school so that they can return to school after the matter is settled. During this period, if they wish to temporarily enter military academies, they may be allowed to take the examination and undergo recruit training. [Signed] General Directorate of Military Training.</p>
<h3>Students Returning from Japan Host Press</h3>
<p>Report on the Circumstances of Their Return</p>
<p>Xu Bodu, Huang Zhaoyuan, Zhao Pingzhang, Zhang Guiyi, Cao Xiumao, Shen Minglun, Cao Xiuxian, Qu Xianglin, and eight other members of the Chinese Students Returning from Japan Delegation hosted the press in the meeting room of the Sichuan Road YMCA at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the circumstances of their return and the outline of their work after returning to China. A summary record is provided below:</p>
<p>Situation in Japan: Briefly, after hearing the alarming news that violent Japan had occupied the Northeast, the students studying in Japan gathered more than 2,000 students to discuss countermeasures. After unanimous discussion, they decided to send a delegation of more than 200 people to the embassy on September 29 to make four requests: (1) lower the flag and return to China; (2) sever diplomatic relations; (3) declare war on Japan; (4) issue ship tickets. After Minister Jiang met with the representatives, he stated that the first three items needed to be reported to the central government for instructions, and he agreed to issue the ship tickets within three days. However, Minister Jiang subsequently received a telegram from the central government informing the students that they did not need to return to China. Therefore, on October 1, they went to the consulate again in heavy rain to make their requests. From 8:00 AM, they waited until 12:00 PM before the consulate agreed to issue 200 ship tickets. However, with 2,000 students, 200 tickets were obviously not enough to distribute. Therefore, they had to change their approach and decided to first send 20 representatives back to China to organize a delegation of students returning from Japan and carry out various tasks in advance. However, on the day of the petition, the consulate was surrounded by Japanese police, and all flyers and declarations were confiscated, which was especially heartbreaking for the students in Japan.</p>
<p>Outline of Work After Returning to China: The outline of work after returning to China that has been planned includes: (1) Starting the registration of students returning from Japan and old classmates returning from Japan to unite them; (2) Returning students are willing to enlist in volunteer armies; (3) Returning students are willing to organize the people to resist Japan; (4) To awaken the people of the country and establish a diplomatic policy toward Japan, the following items have been decided: (A) Establish a Japanese Research Association; (B) Report on the experience of studying Japan; (C) Organize a propaganda team to awaken the national people to unite to resist Japan and save the country.</p>
<p>Reasons for Japan's Sending Troops: They then stated the reasons for Japan's sending troops to the three northeastern provinces: (1) Economic aspects: Due to the economic depression in their country and the exhaustion of national finances, Japan has invested 200 million in Manchuria, constantly fearing conflicts with investments from other countries, and is eager to occupy it for its own benefit. On the other hand, because of the progress of our country's construction in the Northeast, the South Manchuria Railway has gradually failed, leading to resentment and large-scale destruction. (2) Political aspects: Due to the rise of nationalistic ideologies, such as the "Greater Japan Production," "Patriotic Society," "National Essence Society," and other organizations, as well as the rampant ambitions of warlords, the fate of political parties is entirely dependent on Manchuria and Mongolia, which are all the biggest reasons for the Japanese military's undeclared war and sudden occupation of the Northeast.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Japanese National Situation: The Japanese are extremely advanced in education, transportation, and construction everywhere. All students in the country receive military training, and their obedience is particularly admired. All actions are consistent. The Japanese military strength is estimated to be about 300,000 in the army, about 8,000 in the navy, and about 500 aircraft. They are now preparing for a major war and have greatly expanded their forces. The Japanese conspiracy is based on the entire plan of the Manchuria-Mongolia policy, which shows the first step as annexing Korea, the second step as occupying Manchuria and Mongolia, the third step as annexing China, and the fourth step as dominating the world, to realize their so-called continental policy, and so on.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Raises Regular Expenses</h3>
<p>Divided into Five Levels of Responsibility</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters yesterday to the Wusong, Pudong, and Jiangwan Branch Offices, various trade associations, and shop members, stating: On the 12th of this month, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stated in its letter that the sixth standing committee meeting of this association discussed the recommendation of the Economic Committee, and the regular expenses of this association were notified to your association to solicit donations from various trade associations according to different levels, with levels of 2,000 yuan, 1,500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, and 200 yuan. Please prepare for verification. It was resolved to send a letter to your association and various groups to solicit donations separately. In addition to sending separate letters, the case is hereby recorded and communicated to you. Please check and handle the matter. We hope that you will consider the national crisis and enthusiastically solicit donations.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Investigator Rejects Bribe</h3>
<p>Jin Sheng Rice Shop on Wuchang Road in this city, jointly opened by Yang Yuxiang and others, sells foreign rice to supply the Japanese in order to seek profits. The Anti-Japanese Association received a tip-off the day before yesterday and immediately sent investigators Wang Yuxiang and Jin Yongchang to investigate secretly. According to Yang Yuxiang, the manager of the shop, he did have dealings with the Japanese in the past, but since the anti-Japanese national salvation incident occurred, he had stopped supplying them. Wang and Jin then requested to inspect the books of the shop in order to clarify the situation. They found that the cash flow book and the general ledger were inconsistent, which was very suspicious. They took the books back to report to the standing committee for deliberation. Unexpectedly, Yang Yuxiang suddenly invited them to a tea house for a chat and dared to offer a bribe of 200 yuan, requesting to exchange the books and paid 50 yuan and agreed to find another 150 yuan the next evening in the hope of retrieving the accounts. Wang and Jin, seeing that the traitorous merchant had no patriotism and was greedy for profit and flattering to foreigners, and the situation was indeed punishable, feigned agreement and obtained all the evidence before proceeding to punish him according to law. It is heard that this case was resolved by the ninth standing committee meeting of the association yesterday and handed over to the Disciplinary Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Committee for Implementing Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<p>Merged by the Research and Inspection Committees of the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Based on the resolution of the Provisional Members' Representative Assembly, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has organized a Committee for Implementing Economic Severance with Japan.

The Chamber of Commerce has now separately notified Zheng Chengqing, the director of the Research Committee, and Ye Jiaxing, the director of the Inspection Committee, to jointly convene the two committees to discuss the organization and implementation methods.</p>
<h3>Issuing Invoices Must Clearly State "Not Japanese Goods"</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all industry members regarding the need to clearly state "Not Japanese Goods" on sales invoices: On the 13th of this month, the Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stated in its letter that it had received a letter from Mr. Yi Huai stating that in this time of the highest call for non-cooperation, there is a difficulty that makes it impossible for patriots to practice as they wish, which is that it is often not easy to distinguish between hated goods and national goods when shopping. There is now a method, that is, when we shop, we must ask the store to add the following testimonial on the invoice, "This store guarantees that the goods sold on this invoice are definitely not Japanese goods. If there is any deception, once found, the store is willing to be fined ten times the total value of the goods on this invoice." The store stamps its seal and the salesperson signs. With this method, (A) patriots can purchase daily necessities without being deceived, and (B) patriotic merchants can have a further expression of patriotism. We should do our best to publicize the stores that have adopted this method, and those who follow suit will emerge one after another. Gentlemen, you are enthusiastic patriots. Please advise on whether this method is appropriate, etc. It was approved by the eighth standing committee meeting of this association and forwarded to your association to order all trade associations, branches, and stores to comply with it uniformly, etc. It is recorded in the minutes. In addition to replying, the corresponding minutes are recorded and communicated to you, hoping that you will check and handle it. The date of arrival at the meeting, economic severance with Japan, has become a unanimous resolution of the whole country. All stores do not buy or sell Japanese goods, and our business community has long had a firm expression. The anti-Japanese association's request to indicate on the invoice that this item is definitely not Japanese goods is to increase the credibility of the store and the belief of the purchaser, which is beneficial to both the buyer and seller. The corresponding letter is prepared and notified, and please check and comply uniformly.</p>
<h3>Boycotting Goods Was Originally Proposed by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Originated During the Russo-Japanese War in 1904</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram yesterday from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Xiangshan Ciyouyuan in Beiping: Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Having read the news that the Osaka business community's Economic Federation sent a telegram to the League of Nations, reporting on our country's anti-Japanese affairs, it is found that our country had no boycott actions in the past. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Russian ships came east and docked in French territorial waters. Japan created a method of boycotting French goods to vent their anger. Since then, we have followed Japan's example and boycotted goods repeatedly, which was actually initiated by them. They can boycott France, why can't we boycott Japan? Please have your association represent the whole country and quickly telegraph the League of Nations with this intention, asking for consideration. Respectfully, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Xiangshan Ciyouyuan in Beiping.</p>

<h3>Citizens' Federation Recruits National Salvation Volunteers</h3>
<p>Better to Be a Hero Before National Subjugation Than a Remnant Slave After National Subjugation</p>
<p>Shanghai News stated that the Citizens' Federation of this city is recruiting national salvation volunteers to serve as the government's backing. The recruitment notice states: The Japanese army is fierce, launching an undeclared war and implementing its imperialist policy of theft, forcibly occupying the Northeast, bombing our military equipment and property, and shooting our military officers and compatriots, with the intention of undermining the Kellogg-Briand Pact and invading East Asian peace without cause, attempting to impose dreams of annexation, and directly regarding our country as uninhabited. They are now advancing, sending a large fleet to Shanghai, and the Japanese Marines are making demonstrative actions, etc., as if they intend to take Shanghai. In this time of national crisis, the people have the determination to save the country. Taking the responsibility of every citizen, we will jointly resist foreign aggression. Therefore, we have organized a national salvation volunteer army to serve as the backing of our government. The matter concerns the national crisis and the survival of the nation. It is a critical moment. Better to be a hero before national subjugation than a remnant slave after national subjugation. In the shortest possible time, an army will be formed. A registration office is specially set up at the locations listed below. May the enthusiastic and energetic children of China participate enthusiastically. Time is urgent, so let's come together to protect our great rivers and mountains of China, complete our international status, and improve our spirit of independence. The interests of the country and the nation depend on it. It is also heard that the registration offices for the volunteer army are located at the 17th District Branch of the Citizens' Federation, Qingyun Lane 2, North Sichuan Road; the 7th District Branch, Bailu Lane, Broadway Road; the 5th District Branch, Old Street, Lihongqiao; the 6th District Branch, Shishan Lane, Xihua Road; the 10th District Branch, Jingwei Lane, Suzhou Road; the 15th District Branch, Dean Lane 1, Suzhou Road; and the 19th District Branch, inside the Hudong Commune, east of Yangshupu Bridge.</p>
<h3>New Propaganda for Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Organize Five-Person Groups for Chain Propaganda</p>
<p>Yesterday, various groups in this city and the people of Shanghai printed the following:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Special Propaganda for Defending Against the Violent Japanese Invasion: Now, the item of propaganda is recorded below:</p>
<p>Organize a five-person group for chain propaganda on economic severance with Japan. Dear Sir/Madam, Japan is painstakingly planning to destroy China. In the past ten years, its traces have become increasingly evident. Recently, it has sent troops without cause, occupying Shenyang and important places in the East Province to implement its annexation policy. The country will be subjugated soon. We are determined to save the country but unable to wield weapons. We intend to do what we can and fulfill our national responsibility. Considering that Japanese goods rely on China as their only outlet, if we can cut off its outlet, Japan will collapse. Therefore, we invite comrades to passively resist. The method is to first gather five comrades and swear to heaven that in the future, regarding clothing, food, housing, and transportation, except for cultural and medical supplies and other items that cannot be replaced by non-Japanese goods, we will no longer use them until the day they abolish all unequal treaties with China and stop all acts of aggression against China. All members who join this five-person group must each invite four more patriotic comrades to form a group. These four people must then each invite four more comrades to form a group. By inviting others in this way, we gradually spread the word to have five-person groups spread throughout the country to use their patriotic sincerity and implement economic severance. This organization is only guaranteed by the individual's personality to ensure the oath. There are no general or branch groups, nor are there any meetings or gatherings. There are no penalties for members who violate the oath. As for raising funds to open factories and revitalize industries, it is up to the members to handle them freely and is not within the scope of the organization's purpose. Therefore, there are no membership fees or donations. If the members of each group can work hard and persevere, progress can be expected within a year, and Japan will suffer a major blow in less than five years, which is easy for us to do. Anyone can implement it. It depends on human effort. I hope that patriotic people will enthusiastically promote and cooperate to persevere. As long as there is a breath, this aspiration will not be slackened. This is the deepest prayer. Sincerely, the Five-Person Group Against Japan.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned chain propaganda, if compatriots across the country can unite and organize in this way, it will spread throughout the country. Compared with those who verbally boycott but cannot implement it, the effect will be greater.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Work from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Petition to Dismiss Japanese Employees of Customs: The All-China General Headquarters of Chinese Staff of Foreign Departments of Customs submitted a petition to the Central Government by telegram, addressed to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: (Omitted above) Previously, the Examination Yuan and the Ministry of Military Affairs had already dismissed their Japanese advisors. However, there are no fewer than two to three hundred Japanese individuals within the Chinese Customs Service. Ranging from the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Inspectorate General of Customs, Hirokichi Sugii (whose position as a Customs Commissioner is vacant, with a monthly salary of 1,300 taels and allowances of over 600 taels, totaling approximately 3,000 yuan in national currency), and below, they receive substantial annual salaries. The total amount is staggering. Now, during a time of undeclared war, when international law, peace treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty, and all considerations of justice and humanity are disregarded, all Japanese customs staff should be completely dismissed, effective immediately. The aggressive invaders are penetrating deeply, losing ground daily, and the collapse of our divine land is imminent. How can we allow alien enemies to reside long in our financial and tax revenue organs? We earnestly submit this plea, hoping for your insightful consideration.</p>
<p>Important Meeting of the First District Branch of City Residents: The First District Branch of the Shanghai Federation of City Residents held a joint meeting of the Executive Committee and the Japanese Goods Inspection Committee yesterday. Sun Wenyi presided over the meeting. Formalities were observed. (Reported Matters) (1) The Secretariat reported that the following Japanese goods had been sealed: Sincere Company, 50 large crates; Jinlong Hosiery Factory, 5 pieces; Huichuntang, 1 piece; Dasheng Pharmacy, 1 crate; Shuntaixiang, 1 piece; He Yuantong, 2 pieces; Wing On Company, 134 crates; Watertower Watch Company, 5 pieces; Guanshengyuan, 6 pieces; Meiji Huazhen Company, 1 piece; Huaxin Company, 8 pieces; Tongchunxin, 7 showcases; Southern Company, 18 crates; Datong Leather Shoe Company, 1 piece; and Zhonghua Leather Shoe Company, 2 pieces. (Resolutions) (1) Regarding the case of setting a deadline for sealing Japanese goods, another notice will be issued to those stores that have not yet come to the meeting to apply, requiring them to report the sealing by October 16. (2) Sincere Company stated in a letter that the City Anti-Japanese Association misunderstood that their company was selling Japanese goods mixed with other products. They explained that the goods were sold at the end of September, before the association convened members and established procedures on October 2. Although Japanese goods had been sorted and sealed at that time, the volume was too large, and omissions were inevitable. The company cannot bear the responsibility for disrupting the anti-Japanese effort. They requested that personnel be dispatched to thoroughly investigate and dispel public doubts. Wang Lianfang, Sun Wenyi, and Zhou Juren were assigned to investigate and handle the matter. (3) Regarding the case of starting to recruit volunteer soldiers, in addition to Chen Duomin and Zhang Zilian, Zhuang Zhihe, Zhou Juren, Tang Chengzhang, Li Jianliang, and Wang Lianfang were immediately added as responsible committee members, and one clerk was hired to handle volunteer army affairs. (4) Committee member badges will be prepared by a set date for inspection committee members to wear. (The rest omitted)</p>
<p>Silk and Satin Industry Inspects Japanese Goods Today: The Silk and Satin Industry Association held its second group affairs meeting of the Japanese Goods Inspection Group yesterday. Wu Xingcha was publicly elected as chairman. After formalities were observed, the chairman reported on incoming and outgoing correspondence and various certificates, stamps, and seals for use during inspections. Notices and slogans had also been prepared. The following resolutions were passed: (1) It was decided that inspections would begin on October 15, starting with retail stores. Resolution passed. (2) A notice will be issued to retail members to voluntarily seal any remaining Japanese goods they have in stock, pending inspection by association personnel. Resolution passed. (3) Hereafter, all committee members must attend meetings on time. If there is a special reason for being unable to attend in person, they must state the reason for non-attendance and provide a formal letter of authorization, entrusting a representative to attend the meeting. Otherwise, those who are late for more than half an hour after the scheduled time will be fined ten yuan, which will be used for national salvation expenses. Resolution passed.</p>
<p>Patriotic Movement of Workers in Japanese Spinning Mills: Workers in Japanese-owned spinning mills in Shanghai have organized anti-Japanese patriotic associations in both the western and eastern districts of Shanghai to engage in patriotic movements. Yesterday, the association specifically requested the City Anti-Japanese Association to dispatch police protection for the eastern district office. It also issued a notice to workers to abide by order and avoid giving the Japanese an excuse. At the same time, it repeatedly petitioned the City Anti-Japanese Association to devise appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Resignees Should Register Quickly: Since the implementation of economic severance with Japan in this port, all sectors of industry and commerce have risen up in unison. All personnel working in Japanese companies and factories have also resigned voluntarily to demonstrate their determination not to cooperate with the Japanese. It is reported that the seafood and dried goods industry, the piece goods industry, the hardware and machinery industry, etc., in this port, in order to relieve the unemployment of these personnel, have successively sent letters to the Anti-Japanese Association, requesting that these talents be introduced first for employment. It is deeply hoped that in this enthusiastic anti-Japanese atmosphere, all our compatriots who have left Japanese businesses or other organizations will go to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association as soon as possible to request registration, so that there will be no fear of unemployment in the future.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Actively Trains Boy Scouts: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously resolved at a representative conference to send letters to various trade associations, ordering them to organize volunteer armies. It also ordered the Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop to allow the broad recruitment of troop members, so that young merchants could receive Boy Scout training, cultivate healthy and outstanding merchants, serve the country, and serve society. It is now reported that the Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop has officially begun recruitment. Four to five hundred requests for information are received daily. Furthermore, in order to seek comprehensive and widespread training, the Chamber of Commerce has specifically petitioned the municipal party headquarters and sent letters to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to hire voluntary political and military instructors. It has also sent notices to various trade associations and commercial firms to encourage their young people to join the Boy Scout Troop.</p>
<p>Tongde Medical College Anti-Japanese National Salvation Meeting Resolutions: The Tongde Police Academy Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association convened a general meeting of all members yesterday. In addition to all male and female students, quite a few faculty and staff members attended. It was resolved that the rescue team would add two hours of military medicine and first aid training each day. Student soldiers will train from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM daily after instructors are hired. In addition, there were also significant suggestions regarding the inspection of Japanese goods, which may be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Decides to Maintain Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Talk by Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong</p>
<p>More than 100 Million in Foreign Debt Has Been Repaid Since the Fifth Year of the Republic</p>
<p>Foreign Debt Can Be Fully Repaid by the 29th Year of the Republic</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Has Two Measures to Maintain Public Bonds</p>
<p>Once Discussed and Finalized, They Can Be Formally Implemented</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that Minister of Finance Song Ziwen has formally stated that there is no intention to suspend foreign debt payments and that it is necessary to maintain public bonds. Yesterday, Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong formally stated to a Huadong News Agency reporter that the Ministry of Finance has absolutely no intention of suspending foreign debt payments and has definite measures to maintain public bonds. The matter can be implemented after another discussion. According to Zhang, rumors of suspending foreign debt payments originated from a suggestion by Xiong Xiling. Xiong had previously suggested deferring foreign debt payments due to the severity of the floods, but the Ministry of Finance did not initially accept it. Today's newspapers are repeating the propaganda, which is actually inaccurate. The Ministry of Finance's commitment to maintaining domestic and foreign debt remains unchanged, as national debt concerns national credit. If domestic and foreign debt were to waver, the country's finances would be beyond repair. Although China's financial situation has been burdened by years of incessant internal wars, the amount of debt has decreased rather than increased. Taking the fifth year of the Republic as a starting point, more than 100 million has been repaid in foreign debt over the past fifteen years. By the 29th year of the Republic, it can be gradually repaid in full. At that time, China's finances will naturally have better solutions. As for domestic debt, more than 15 million is repaid each month, and the credit is well-established. Although old debts have not been cleared, new debts arise, but they have actually decreased compared to the past. The Ministry of Finance firmly believes that the credit of domestic and foreign debt must be maintained. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is doing its best to maintain the public bonds, even though it clearly knows that the sharp drop in bond prices is due to social unrest and manipulation by speculators. Now, they are gathering to discuss a permanent method for maintaining public bonds, either by establishing a committee to purchase public bonds or by establishing a company to purchase public bonds. It is still under careful consideration. It does not pursue empty talk but seeks practicality. Once it is determined, it can be implemented. China's finances, although difficult due to years of internal wars, are still more lenient compared to other countries. If internal wars cease and disasters decrease, then China's finances will definitely not have to panic again. This is evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of Finance has repaid a huge amount of debt over the years, which can be known.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Japanese Ships Planned to Be Leased to British Merchants for Operation</h3>
<p>British Merchants Have Not Yet Dared to Accept</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Suspend Operations Due to Lack of Cargo: Chinese merchants in this port have mutually warned each other not to load cargo or travel on Japanese ships. Therefore, the Yangtze River ships of the Nisshin Company are sailing almost completely empty. Although Japanese merchants have goods loaded on their ships, after arriving at the port, Chinese workers refuse to load or unload them, making it impossible to transport them. The Shanghai-Yichang route of the company's upper Yangtze River ship "Daheng Maru" had neither passengers nor cargo when it departed from Shanghai this time. The ship owner reported this to the company. As a result, the company decided to suspend the Shanghai-Yichang route because the empty ships were burning too much coal. The "Daheng Maru" has not yet departed.</p>
<p>British Ships Have Flourishing Business: There have always been six companies operating on the Yangtze River. Since all Chinese river ships suspended operations, only British and Japanese ships have been traveling between Shanghai and Hankou. With the occurrence of the boycott movement, Chinese ships are not operating, and Japanese ships refuse to transport cargo. After the water receded in Wuhan, the time was ripe for department stores to load cargo. Therefore, the entire business has created a great opportunity for British ships. Recently, the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Yangtze River ships have been full of cargo and passengers, whether inbound or outbound. Each ship earns at least ten thousand taels in freight. Even so, it still feels like there is more cargo than ships, and the demand is not being met.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Smuggled on Foreign Ships: If Japanese goods are loaded on Japanese ships and transported to the Yangtze River area, Chinese workers in various places refuse to load or unload them. Therefore, Japanese merchants have agreed to have the Japanese handle customs declarations and also entrust British ships to transport the goods. Therefore, items such as Dong sugar, piece goods, and kelp are still being transported out. British ships, because of their business interests, routinely agree to carry the goods. Most of these Japanese goods are being unloaded at ports such as Jiujiang, Hankou, and Hunan province. It is not known whether the anti-Japanese groups in those places are aware of this.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Leased to British Merchants: Since the Wanbaoshan Incident, Shanghai has boycotted Japanese ships. Since the 18th of last month, it has become even more intense. The Nisshin Company in Shanghai, which has always had the largest Yangtze River shipping business, has more than twenty ships on the Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, and Changsha routes. Now, because Chinese merchants in various places along the Yangtze River have unanimously refused to transport cargo on Japanese ships for more than a month, there is no business to speak of. If this continues, they will have to cease operations, and it is not expected to be resolved in the short term. Recently, the company, seeing that British ships are crowded and there is a shortage of supply, has decided to lease all of its Yangtze River ships to a certain British shipping company in this port to manage, while Nisshin will collect rent and avoid losses from idle ships. This matter is already under secret negotiation.</p>
<p>British Merchants Have Not Yet Agreed: Although a certain British shipping company in this port feels a shortage of ships due to the sudden increase in Yangtze River business, it is afraid that leasing Japanese ships will cause resentment from the Chinese people and lead to a major blow to business. Therefore, it has not yet accepted the offer, and the Japanese merchant's leasing terms are still under detailed consideration.</p>
<h3>Shipping News Amidst Anti-Japanese Voices</h3>
<p>Dalian Port Has Not Yet Been Blockaded: Yesterday, it was widely rumored in this port that Dalian Bay had been blockaded by the Japanese Navy, and Chinese in Dalian Bay could no longer leave the country. After this news spread, it caused considerable doubt in society, and commercial groups with trade relations with Dalian Bay paid even more attention. They inquired with Japanese merchants one after another. Yesterday, according to the Dalian Steamship Company in this port, the company had not received this news, and the "Changchun Maru" ship of the Shanghai-Dalian route had already sailed from Dalian and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 4:00 PM tomorrow. Tickets for ships to Dalian from Shanghai are still being sold, and the company is still accepting goods to be loaded to Dalian as usual. Therefore, the talk of a blockade is inevitably premature.</p>
<p>Students and Overseas Chinese Returning from the East: Students studying in Japan have agreed to return to China as a whole. There have already been quite a few who have returned to Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, another 37 people arrived, including Shen Zairen, Su Bingyi, Zeng Xiuxian, Kong Jiguang, Sun Jian, Song Xiaogao, and Zhou Daozeng. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the Japanese mail ship "Shanghai Maru" was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday as usual. There was a large number of Japanese students returning home on board. Later, due to a large storm in the Sea of Japan, it was postponed for one day and will now enter the port at 3:00 PM this afternoon. In addition, there have been four batches of overseas Chinese returning home in the past two days, totaling 203 people, including Zhou Wenxian, Jiang Zhonghua, and Chen Hongchang.</p>
<h3>Various Industry Tax Rules Associations Request Abolition of Sino-Japanese Agreed Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Twenty-Third Committee Resolution</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Trade Associations of various industries in this city held its twenty-second committee meeting yesterday. The attending committee members were Xie Zhongle, Ye Chunqiao, Ge Liangqing, Zheng Hairuo, Zheng Chengqing, etc. The chairman was Zheng Chengqing. The resolutions were as follows: (1) It is proposed to request the Ministry of Finance to explicitly abolish the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tax rate agreement to punish violent acts. Resolution passed. (2) It is proposed to send a letter to the Bureau of Finance to clearly stipulate that the tax rate for brokers who have not paid the broker's license fee should be calculated based on the amount of commission. Resolution passed. (3) Wholesale outlets directly set up by manufacturing industries should be exempt from business tax. Resolution passed to send a letter to the Bureau of Finance to grant exemption. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Shigemitsu Aoi Returns to Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi went from Shanghai to Beijing on Double Tenth Day, where he lodged an unreasonable protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Japanese crackdown on anti-Japanese activities. This has attracted national attention.

<p>Since Japanese warships arrived in Shanghai one after another, Deng Zhenquan, commander of the Wusong Fortress, telegraphed the central government for instructions and strictly ordered the officers and soldiers under his command to strengthen security measures for the fortress's defense. However, recently, Japanese individuals have frequently carried photographic equipment to take films and spy on the terrain near the Songdi Fortress. Yesterday, he issued an order to his subordinates to prohibit photography and spying in the fortress area. If there are any suspicious individuals, they will be searched to maintain national defense.</p>
<h3>Four National Goods Groups Schedule Meeting</h3>
<p>The Four National Goods Groups will hold a factory member representative meeting on the 17th to discuss the anti-Japanese and national salvation issue. A notice was issued yesterday, stating: To Whom It May Concern: The Japanese army's violent acts have invaded and occupied the Northeast. For the sake of self-defense and national salvation, the people of our country are vigorously boycotting Japanese goods, severing economic ties, and peacefully struggling to save the country. As a result, the raw materials for national goods factories in our country have encountered significant problems. In order to protect the interests of members and strive for relief, the representatives of the four national goods groups have decided to convene an emergency meeting of the industrial and commercial factory member representatives of the four groups at 2:00 PM on Saturday, the 17th of this month (please observe the time) in the auditorium of the National Development Maintenance Association in Nine Acres. We will gather wisdom and discuss countermeasures together, and discuss the entire anti-Japanese and national salvation work of the national goods sector. At that time, we sincerely hope that your members will send representatives (new self) to attend the meeting. This is specially notified.

<h3>Overseas Chinese from Mexico Pass Through Shanghai to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Second Batch Totals Sixty-One People</p>
<p>After the expulsion of Chinese from Mexico, the second batch of Chinese overseas compatriots returning home from Mexico, totaling sixty-one people, including Wang Cheng and Fang Ji, went from Mexico to New York, then transferred to the San Francisco ship to return to China. Most of these overseas Chinese are from the Nanhai, Taishan, Shatou, and Zhongshan counties of Guangdong province.

<h3>Minsheng Warship to Test Fire on the 17th</h3>
<p>Jiangyuan Warship Will Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The newly built Minsheng warship of the Naval Department was originally scheduled to go to Songkou today for a test firing. However, because the supervisor Li Shijia is in Japan and will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until the morning of the 16th, the warship has been rescheduled to conduct the test firing in Songkou on the morning of the 17th. Also, the Jiangyuan warship of the Naval Department, which previously sank in Fujian, was towed to Shanghai for repairs by Yongji. It was originally planned to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th, but due to encountering wind on the way, it was delayed for two days. It will only be able to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon and will need to be put into the dock for repairs immediately.</p>
<h3>Mistaking British Officer for Russian Spy</h3>
<p>Treated with Courtesy</p>
<p>Proved and Released</p>
<p>The Damer Late News says that at 10:30 PM last night (the 13th), Major Fleetwood, acting battalion commander of the British Scottish Regiment, and Lieutenant Buchanan, both dressed in plain clothes, were seen wandering back and forth near Hongqiao Aerodrome and studying a map carefully. Chinese sentries saw their suspicious behavior and mistook them for Russian spies. They were detained and sent to the aerodrome for questioning, then transferred to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters. When the two explained that they were British officers, personnel were dispatched to the British Consulate General for verification, and they were immediately released. They were detained for a total of three hours. Afterwards, the two officers found that the Chinese soldiers treated them courteously and held no grudges. However, it is heard that the British authorities may issue a protest regarding the procedures.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association Opposes Narcotic Drugs Organization</h3>
<p>Disguised Public Sale Will Hasten Demise: Sends Letter Requesting Explanation to Clarify the Truth</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, concerned that the State Council recently resolved to establish a general and branch management organization for narcotic drugs, fearing that it is a disguised plan for the public sale of drugs, has sent a letter to the National Government requesting a detailed explanation of the methods and nature of this organization to dispel public doubts. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Having read in the newspapers that Article 2 of the resolution of the State Council meeting on the 13th stated that the Smoking Prohibition Committee presented that the Narcotic Drugs Management Regulations had already been promulgated, but the general and branch organizations had not yet been designated. The Ministry of Interior should be instructed to establish the general and branch management organizations for narcotic drugs as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations. Please examine and approve the implementation of the case. Resolution: Approved. We are deeply suspicious. The measures for the Narcotic Drugs Management Office, advocated by those who advocated the public sale of opium a few days ago, were no different from a disguised public sale of opium and all kinds of drugs, violating the late Premier's legacy of refusing drugs and destroying the spirit of the Kuomintang's constitution. They were unanimously opposed by the people of the whole country, and the National Government's Legislative Yuan rejected them, and they disappeared without a trace and were cancelled in an invisible manner. Today, we are deeply suspicious as to whether the measures for the general and branch management organization for narcotic drugs passed by the State Council are still of the previous nature, and the committee did not clarify the detailed measures when submitting them for resolution, which is vague and cannot but arouse suspicion among the people of the country and make them recall the past. At this time of national crisis, when the mountains and rivers are broken, and our country is determined to strengthen itself and strive for good governance from top to bottom, it is absolutely impossible to adopt any more resolutions that violate the will of the people or hasten our own demise. We earnestly request that your government follow public opinion and clearly explain and publicize to the people of the country the detailed measures and actual nature of the general and branch management organization for narcotic drugs that have been passed, which will surely dispel doubts and quell rumors. We are extremely hopeful. This is addressed to the National Government, Chinese National Anti-Drug Association.</p>

<h3>Customs River Department Recovers Private Pontoons in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Customs River Department recently recovered ten pontoons in the Huangpu River from private companies, starting from the pontoons in front of the old dock and ending at the pontoons in front of the Mitsubishi Company wharf. These pontoons were originally owned by Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Ocean Steamship (managed by Butterfield &amp; Swire), China Merchants, and Nippon Yusen Osaka companies. The port authorities, considering that the number of ships entering and leaving this port is increasing daily and that the ship berthing space will not be able to meet the demand, have gradually recovered privately owned pontoons for public use in order to facilitate centralized management. However, two or three of the former owners still retain priority rental rights. It is now reported that three of the recovered pontoons have been replaced with iron piers deeply buried at the bottom of the river, and the rest will also be renovated successively.</p>
<h3>National Goods Electric Lights and Machines Shine Brightly</h3>
<p>The Xinzhong Engineering Company, located at 378 Jiangxi Road in this port, has long been famous for manufacturing black oil engines. Recently, it has expanded its scope to manufacture four-week electric hoist engines and generators, transformers, etc. All the machines that should be equipped in a power plant are readily available. Recently, the Anting Power Plant purchased a complete set of machines from the company and asked the company's manager, Zhi Bingyuan, to design the routes, buildings, and machine layout. The entire project was completed in less than three months. It is heard that the lights were turned on during the Double Tenth Festival. The lights were brilliant, and the streets were resplendent. Observers said that although the plant is small in scale, its equipment is complete and can serve as a model for small power plants in the city.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Propaganda</h3>
<p>"China Pictorial Magazine" Special Issue on the Brutal Japanese Occupation of the Northeast</p>
<p>The special issue of "China Pictorial Magazine" on the brutal Japanese occupation of the Northeast, compiled and printed by the China Pictorial Magazine Publishing House at the intersection of Haining Road and North Sichuan Road, is entirely printed in photogravure. It contains forty photographs depicting various atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Northeast, such as the sneak attack on Shenyang, the bombardment of Beidaying, the burning of prosperous streets, the kidnapping of officials and civilians, the wanton behavior of soldiers in the countryside, the intimidation of streetcars, a detailed map of the occupied area, the confiscation of more than 100 aircraft in the entire Northeast, the forced disbandment of our country's police, as well as close-up shots of important figures in the Northeast and the commanders of the Japanese army, all of which are included. Each picture is accompanied by detailed explanations in both Chinese and English, as well as a central article detailing the incident. Anyone who wants to understand the truth about the Japanese atrocities in order to strengthen their determination to fight against the common enemy should have a copy in hand. It is heard that the publication is only selling for one dollar in order to promote widespread publicity. Those who subscribe to China for the whole year will receive a free copy.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Northeast News Agency</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Northeast issue, all those with blood and spirit have been filled with fervor, jointly devising countermeasures. It is regrettable that the external publicity apparatus is incompletely organized, and true information cannot be conveyed to various countries. Time and again, they are deceived by the malicious propaganda of the Japanese, reversing facts and obliterating the truth, which is deeply regrettable. Recently, Xu Shuyuan, Jiang Xinzhao, and others, aware of this situation, have specially joined with many like-minded people to initiate and establish the Northeast News Agency. Its purpose is to specifically disseminate news about the Northeast, investigate the facts of Japanese atrocities, and provide them to Chinese and foreign newspapers, thereby correcting foreign biases and encouraging the courage of the Chinese people. They have already received the support of many prominent figures from all walks of life. Both Mr. Xu and Mr. Jiang have served in the news industry for more than ten years, so the organization is quite complete. In addition to the Chinese department, there are also English, French, Japanese, and telegraph departments, each staffed with experts in writing and translation. Preparations are currently underway, and branch offices in various locations in North China, Beijing, and Guangdong will soon be officially sending out news releases.</p>
<h3>New Books from the New Era Bookstore</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the New Era Bookstore has seen its publications sell well in various provinces and Nanyang ports, and its business has been very prosperous. Recently, the bookstore has released thirty types of New Era Literary Series, including "Prairie Stories" translated by Ba Jin, "Shadows" translated by Lini, "The Last Companion" translated by Zeng Jinke, "Hot Love" translated by Yang Changxi, and "Trilogy of Love", "Escape from Love", "Book of Farewell" by Zeng Jinke, "From Xiao E to Lu Xun" by Zhang Ruogu, "Season of Cherry Blossoms", "Autumn Dream" by Mao Yibo, "Expression of Life and Death" by Lu Jianbo, and several other types already published.

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Library Benefits Readers</h3>
<p>Increased Book Lending and Delivery Department</p>
<p>Since the publication of the revised book catalog of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commercial Library, the number of people from all walks of life visiting the library to read and borrow books has been increasing day by day. However, some shop employees are unable to leave their shops due to work and time constraints, and although they want to read, they have no opportunity. Aware of this situation, the library has, in addition to keeping the opening hours as stipulated, changed the borrowing hours to 12:30 PM to 7:45 PM, and added a book lending and delivery department. A librarian has been specially hired to handle the matter, and bicycles have been purchased specifically for delivery. All books required by readers can be delivered on schedule. It is understood that these measures and regulations have been approved and implemented by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Those who are interested in learning can borrow books directly from the library by mail.</p>
<h3>Residents of Wende Lane Oppose Demolition of Houses</h3>
<p>More than seventy households in Wende Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, Yangshupu, in this city, are mostly working class and live very hard lives. The property originally belonged to Changji Company and has recently been sold to Huada Foreign Firm. The firm recently issued a notice, limiting the original tenants to move out of the houses by the end of this month in order to demolish and rebuild. The tenants were suddenly shocked when they learned of this. They held a tenants' meeting at 7 PM the day before yesterday, and decided to elect Gu Rui, Li Lanting, Xu Ruming, Jiang Jun, Shao Yuchen, Zhang Baolian, Yuan Shirong, Zhou Shunkui, Chen Gongchen, Chen Changfu, Kong Shanxiu, Hu Shulin, Ren Tianfu, and thirteen others as representatives to handle the opposition to the demolition of houses. They temporarily used the Zhuhuitang in this lane as an office and named it the Shanghai Zhoujiazui Road Wende Lane Tenants' Representatives Association.</p>
<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Sugar Trade Association of Sugar and Sugar Industries sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations in various regions yesterday to clarify the distinction between enemy goods and non-enemy goods sugar: Respected Sirs, We have investigated that the types of sugar shipped into our country by the Japanese include: (1) Machine-made refined white sugar (fine and soft sand); (2) Rock sugar (sizes vary, pulling an inch); (3) Red sugar syrup (very few mat packages). The so-called "Taiwan green" sugar has not been around for a long time. Currently, many Nanyang goods stores still use this name, but in reality, they are other types of green sugar. Since the occurrence of resistance to enemy goods, Japanese sugar has rarely dared to be trafficked. Since the Liaoning incident, our association has organized a Japanese goods inspection team to assist in the anti-Japanese national salvation inspection, so it is extremely difficult for Japanese sugar to be active. However, recently, we have received letters from sugar merchants and Nanyang goods stores in various regions, stating that the coarse sand, finely ground sand, cotton white, Dutch red, bowl green, Taikoo sugar, and domestically produced ice flower green, block ice, and other sugars of non-enemy goods from Java that they purchased and transported are often detained by the Anti-Japanese Association as enemy goods. Although they have argued, they are often not returned, causing damage to their business and endless pain. We hereby publish a notice, respectfully requesting the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations in various regions to understand the difficulties of merchants, distinguish between right and wrong, and not to mistakenly detain non-enemy goods sugar, so as to avoid innocent losses to merchants, and your association can also increase the faith of the people's groups. We respectfully submit this request and hope you will consider it.</p>
<p>The Nanyang Goods Industry's Japanese Goods Inspection Team convened a meeting of district officers yesterday, chaired by Gong Jingyan, to (1) discuss the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's third executive committee resolution on (1) methods of severing relations with Japan, (2) implementation methods, and (3) disciplinary measures, requesting all members of the industry to abide by the regulations. A resolution was made to notify members to comply and handle the matter. (1) Discuss the case of Japanese goods not registered by this industry, which should be sealed up and not moved, and reported to the association. A resolution was made to notify members to comply and handle the matter. (1) Discuss the case of district officers to be recommended by each district, who should immediately report to the association in detail and receive symbols to carry out their work. A resolution was made to notify district officers to comply and handle the matter. The Stevedore Transportation Industry Association received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce informing them of the organization of a Japanese goods inspection team and the establishment of a volunteer army. It convened a temporary representative meeting a few days ago to discuss the matter and resolved to publicly appoint Standing Committee member Ma Zhongxiang as the director and organize eleven inspection teams, scheduled to conduct inspections in segments on the 17th of this month. As for the organization of the volunteer army, Zhang Fan, Ma Zhongxiang, Wang Jinwen, and others were publicly appointed to actively prepare for it.</p>
<p>Candle Industry The Candle Industry Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Li Meisheng, to discuss the following: (1) The association should lead its members, act as a backing for the government, and unanimously break off economic relations with Japan. After investigating, the products of this industry do not contain inferior raw materials. A resolution was made to notify all members and family members of shop employees to vow not to buy Japanese goods. (2) Lao Xiangtai Company proposed to request a price increase due to the recent flying of asphalt. A resolution was made to reserve the matter. (3) A case of secretly discounting candle prices was discussed and a resolution was made to notify all members that, from now on, all prices must be in accordance with the public market and must not be deliberately violated.</p>
<p>China Woolen Fabric Factory Industry The China Woolen Fabric Factory Industry Association decided to convene all industry workers at 1:00 PM today (the 15th) to hold an anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda meeting. Professor Zhou from Donghua University was invited to speak about the brutality of the Japanese invading our Northeast, and the National Goods Propaganda Group will perform "Tears of Blood in Shenyang" to encourage our righteousness and curb their fierce flames.</p>

<h3>News of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Saltern Workers Propose Water Drainage Strategies</p>
<p>Minimal Labor for Quick Results, Little Expenditure for Great Effect</p>
<p>Yang Guojun and others, representatives of the saltern refugees from Heduo Field in Dongtai County, submitted a petition to the Salt Reclamation Federation, stating that it was for refugees to make a plea, seeking fundamental relief and proposing to open up various saltern river ports and drain water to the sea, using work as a form of relief. It requested blessings, alms, and assistance. The refugees reside northeast of the Fandi levee and belong to Dongtai County. The land is originally low-lying, and the rivers are as narrow as ditches. They dry up first in drought years and flood first in times of heavy rain. This autumn, Cao levee dams were applied, and because the lake water was saturated and rising, multiple places were continuously opened, but the water did not return to the sea, taking the lower reaches as ditches, causing floods and disasters. All the farmland and villages in Xinghua and Dongtai were mostly submerged in the vast waves. The autumn crops submerged in the water rotted like mud, which was a rare disaster not seen in a hundred years. What is even more worrying is that if there is no way to drain the water on the ground for one day, the accumulated water will not recede for one day. If the accumulated water does not recede, then wheat cannot be sown, and houses cannot be thatched. In the autumn rain and autumn wind, with hunger and cold, many of the hundreds of thousands of refugees in our saltern area who have been affected and trapped will surely freeze and starve to death. Can we wait until next spring to worry about the future? Before the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, the Cao levee dams were opened and closed according to the time. Every time a dam was opened, there must be a sea outlet downstream. Over the years, the sea has moved eastward, and the silt has gradually thickened. The old ports in various salterns that used to draw water into the sea are mostly silted up and impassable. Therefore, the water flowing westward flows on the ground, spreading flat instead of rushing straight down, and it will surely flood an entire village before passing through a revolution, and flooding over a mile before passing through a mile, advancing step by step, with no place spared. All the salterns are submerged, and it is not possible to expect them to recede soon. Moreover, if there is no way out downstream, and the dams upstream are not opened, it will be difficult to eliminate the accumulated water in various places, and the number of refugees will increase day by day. Even if they do not die from drowning, they will surely die from hunger and cold. Although they have received the generous donations from various charities, the refugees believe that the disaster area is very wide, and the number of refugees is increasing day by day. While a breath remains, how can they bear to sit and wait for food, adding to the burden of endless relief? Deeply grateful, they have gathered to discuss the method of fundamental relief and contribute a foolish view. They all believe that opening up the sea outlets of various saltern rivers, draining water into the sea, following its downward nature, and dividing its overflowing force can eliminate the disaster of blockage and subsidence. Moreover, using work as a form of relief will cost half the effort and double the effect, and can also solve the current crisis and save relief efforts. Near the ground, if we want to prevent tidal water from flowing backwards in the future, we can set up gates according to the land and open and close them according to the time, that is, build embankments on the higher silt in the east section. Now, because the refugees are afraid that saving the dead is not enough, it is even more difficult to cook without rice. This is what we hope from the compassion of the benevolent. Therefore, we have listed the places where we know that the ports can be opened to divert the western water, listing their distance from the sea and the funds needed for the project, and calling for tens of thousands of affected and trapped refugees to the association for its benevolent judgment, blessings, alms, and assistance, and urge its success. And we respectfully request that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be asked to order the closure of the Cao levee dam openings as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering of the people in the lower reaches of the river, so as to reduce one point of incoming water, and reduce one point of disaster, then a thousand autumns of praise, creating immeasurable blessings. In addition to submitting to the Yi Zhen Ji Sheng Association, we hereby weep and plead, submitting the Jiangsu Salt Reclamation Federation, refugees' representatives from Heduo Field in Dongtai County, Yang Guoan, Yang Guojun, Yao Rujun, Qian Changrong, and Zong Ruyu, now submit the engineering of Hehuo, Shawei, and Sanlu in Dongtai County, which can be opened up to drain water, for your review and approval.</p>

<h3>Situation of the Water Disaster Association Work Group</h3>
<p>The Work Group of the National Government Relief Water Disaster Committee, entrusted to Cheng Pengsheng, the Jiangsu Rehabilitation Commissioner, has been organizing the Jiangbei District Rehabilitation Office in Yangzhou for about two decades. Yesterday, according to Lu Zhefu, the section chief of the office, the personnel in the office are divided into groups and work diligently from dawn to dusk, without any spare time. They have already arranged the urgent relief and accommodation matters in various districts. The situation of the work in the past two decades is recorded as follows: (1) Internal organization, (2) Actual work, (3) Regulations for accommodation, (4) Preparing porridge factories, (5) Investigating and releasing urgent relief, (6) Dividing areas for inspection, (7) Planning winter relief, (8) Hiring county inspectors. It is also heard that Commissioner Cheng has resigned to the work group director Zhu due to the heavy responsibilities and difficulties in handling affairs in the disaster area. He has recently received a reply telegram of reassurance.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Water Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Disaster in Dongtai The water in Dongtai has not yet receded greatly. Chen Jun Sibai wrote an article on disaster survey, saying "to the east of Xinhu", in the middle, describing the disaster in Dongtai as extremely tragic. The original text is as follows: The water flow is very rapid and gradually increases, almost without interruption. Last time, when the northwest wind was strong, the land rose a foot in a few hours, even exceeding the record of the Republic of China. Recently, it was heard that a certain Li near Beishe in the Sixth District glimpsed a cabinet with four children hidden inside. Outside, a man and a woman embraced the cabinet and tied it with hemp rope, resembling a couple. The Li family had no strength to bury them and listened to them drifting away. Many floating corpses were found in the river under the Yan Guang Temple in Dongtai City, floating along the waves. A farmer surnamed Zhang suddenly felt compassion and intended to salvage and bury them. Unexpectedly, as soon as he obtained a corpse, it was too heavy to lift, as if it was restricted by something. The farmer was shocked, suspecting it was a ghost. Upon closer inspection, he saw that the corpse was firmly tied with a rope. He exerted his efforts to tie the rope and saw floating corpses coming up one after another, as many as seven in total, including old and young men, women, and children. Seeing so many floating corpses, the farmer could not bury them and abandoned them in the middle of the stream, rowing away. Fang Bingzhang, a member of the rescue team, saw another small boat in the Dadong River salvaging a mahogany cabinet. Unexpectedly, upon opening it, there were three floating corpses curled up inside, one being a middle-aged man and two being children. It turned out that they had no place to hide when the flood flooded and were unexpectedly swept down by the waves. Since the western water flowed down, the houses were submerged, and the utensils floated away and could be seen everywhere. Those who sailed near Baozhuang saw a square table floating by and were about to salvage it when they suddenly saw a child's corpse tied upside down on each leg of the table. They quickly abandoned it, saying that they did not know where it drifted. A certain village west of Qin Tong, whose house was not far from the mouth of the water, was old and dilapidated. When the water came, the house collapsed, and the whole family ran out, not caring for their parents, wives, and children. Four of them were swept away by the water in a daze. The latter two also died because they could not be saved. Finally, a man, in unbearable pain, shouted "Mother" and jumped into the water to end it all. Things like this are countless. This is just a few real events to illustrate the rest. (The following is omitted)</p>
<h3>Urgent Relief News from Various Provincial Water Disaster Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Urgent Relief of Water Disasters in Various Provinces recorded the following urgent relief news yesterday:</p>
<p>Progress of Rent Relief The association sent a letter to Mr. Zhang Xiaolin yesterday based on the executive committee's proposal, stating, "Respected Sir, at yesterday's meeting of the executive committee of this association, the rent fundraising case was discussed.

<p>Donations from the Zhejiang Water Disaster Association The association received 20,000 yuan remitted by the Zhejiang Yin County Water Disaster Association yesterday and attached a letter stating, "Since our association initiated fundraising, we have collected a significant amount. In addition to providing relief to the affected people in the area and allocating funds separately, we have specifically entrusted the Ningbo Bank of China to first send 20,000 yuan to your association and request that you distribute it on our behalf."</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Relief Funds Remitted Yesterday The association remitted the following amounts to various places yesterday through the Bank of China: (1) 30,000 yuan to northern Anhui, to Liu Lingsheng in Bengbu, (2) 7,000 yuan to southern Henan, to Zhang Gongheng, (3) 3,000 yuan to central Anhui, to Zhai Zhancheng in Wuhu, (4) 20,000 yuan to Hunan, to Zhao Youqin in Changsha.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Races to Produce Large Batches of Cotton Clothing</h3>
<p>The National Government Disaster Relief Committee has recently rushed to build hundreds of reed mat sheds in the large open space behind the Wing On Company warehouse on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei to prepare for rushing to produce cotton clothing. It is heard that a total of one million sets of men's and women's cotton-padded jackets and trousers in Shanghai will be contracted by military uniform factories such as Dahua. As soon as the shed houses are built, they will recruit workers to rush to produce them, scheduled to be completed within two months.</p>
<h3>Urgent Relief Appeal from Beianfeng</h3>
<p>A letter from the Beianfeng District Provisional Disaster Relief Branch of Xinghua County says, "Greetings to all newspaper offices. The villages inside and outside the Weihu of Beianfeng District have not harvested for three years, so that this year, the farmers' capital for transplanting rice seedlings has all come from borrowing. After the summer solstice, continuous rain flooded almost all the fields. Before autumn, three dams were released in succession, and more than 20 places collapsed on the Yundi levee. The late rice beans and grains were all submerged. Even if a small amount of green early rice was harvested, it was almost zero. Recently, due to the sudden hurricane on August 27 and September 2, angry waves hit the sky. The Daweizhuang Weihu was breached one after another. In addition, the residential bases of the residents in the Weihu (who usually use the Daweihu as a guarantee) were all built on the fields. Once the Weihu was breached, the houses, rice grains, agricultural tools, property, cattle, dogs, chickens, and pigs were all washed away with the waves. The amount of the loss is impossible to estimate. The people protect their lives, either escaping to the rooftops or climbing trees. They have no place to cook during the day and no place to stay at night. The sound of crying shakes the sky and is unbearable to hear. Those who have been swept into the giant waves are seen to be chased by the wave minister, but no one dares to save them. Deaths occur one after another, and no one knows how many. The ports entering the sea are not smooth, and there is no prospect of receding water and no time for cultivation. The separation of flesh and blood is almost hopeless, and the danger of taking risks is worthy of concern. Perhaps because Xinghua's topography is low in the northwest and high in the southeast, the disaster is lighter than in the western villages. In fact, the eastern villages are the four Weihu Weizhen and are higher than the western villages. As for the residential bases and fields in the eastern villages, the water is still a zhang deep, and the disaster is more or less the same as the Dazonghu area in the western villages. A few days ago, the farmers' associations and village chiefs of each village reported the disaster situation to the Xinghua Relief Branch and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Branch through the District Farmers' Association, requesting that urgent relief be released so that the disaster victims could be included in the ranks of the dead. Still, they fear that the writing cannot fully express the situation, and they have recommended Zhao Zhonghuang and others to meet with Jushi Henian to state everything. On one side, they have recommended representatives Chen Yiru, Gu Shenwu, and Weng Zhaoxiang to visit the two associations to present the disaster situation and beg for urgent relief to benefit the disaster victims, and also pray that the great philanthropists at home and abroad will donate food and money so that the 100,000 disaster victims in the area will feel the grace of saving their lives. The Beianfeng Provisional Disaster Relief Branch of Xinghua County bows down."</p>
<h3>Japanese Lawyers Buy Our Country's Land</h3>
<p>Evil Plot, Inferior Guarantees, Loss of Conscience, Madness</p>
<p>Party Headquarters and Police Station Jointly Report</p>
<p>Zhang Youren, the chief of the 6th Tu of the 28th Bao in the French Concession of Western Shanghai, had previously dug up graves and stolen and sold fields. He was later reported to the Procuratorate of the District Court. However, the chief did not repent. Recently, he also colluded with Zhang Qinpu, the guarantee, to steal and sell seven or eight mu of people's fields in front of the house of the owners Yang Guansheng, Yang Ayu, Yang Liaotou, and Yang Kaosheng, located on the northwest corner of the Hongqiao Road Japanese Tongwen Academy (ie, Yaojiazhai), to Japanese lawyers Murakami and Fujii. Mr. Qian came forward on their behalf, and the matter has been settled and some deposit has been received. The contract will be signed soon. Recently, the Party Headquarters in the area and the Second Precinct of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this and investigated it one after another. They all said that at the time when the Japanese were invading our eastern provinces, the chief and guarantor dared to steal and sell national land to the Japanese, violating national laws and defying public anger. They reported the situation to their superiors and requested that the Land Bureau stop signing the contract. They also dismissed the chief and guarantor for investigation.</p>

<h3>Hanyu Line Test Flight Pilot Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation Hanyu Line test flight, led by Western pilot Anderson and deputy director Nie Kaiyi and Bande, and others, left Shanghai on the 10th and flew to Hanyu. The next morning (the 11th) at 7 AM, they took off from Hanyu and arrived in Chongqing at 3 PM that afternoon. They stopped in Yichang and Wanxian. The pilots flew along the Yangtze River waterway to observe the situation. If there were mountains and gorges, they changed course to fly over them. They examined the situation at each station along the way in great detail. They left Yu yesterday morning and returned to Hanyu, and were able to fly back to Shanghai and report to the company. They will schedule a formal aviation service at a later date.</p>
<h3>Pacific Society General Assembly Date</h3>
<p>Decided to Hold on the 21st of this Month</p>
<p>The Pacific International Society continued to hold an administrative meeting at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund yesterday. The directors from various countries who attended were still those from yesterday. At the same time in the afternoon, the Research Committee and the Work Program Committee also held meetings separately in the afternoon. According to a statement issued by the secretariat of the association, the Philippines requested to join when the meeting continued to discuss association affairs and administrative issues yesterday afternoon. As a result, after the chairman, on behalf of Ge Kuan, explained, he immediately sent a telegram to Manila according to the third and second clauses of the articles of association, expressing welcome and informing them that the general assembly date had been approved for the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xilin Case Detectives and Kidnappers are Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Three More Accomplices Captured</p>
<p>Zhang Xilin, the owner of Lishengchang Silk Shop on Shandong Road, was kidnapped by bandits on the 2nd of this month. He was rescued by Chinese and Western detectives from the General Inspectorate in Xijiazhai, Zhoujiaqiao, Lincoln Road on the morning before last. Details were noted in yesterday's newspaper. However, the two bandits who were shot and wounded by the detectives, whose real names are Liu Jinhua and Jiang Weiliang, have not yet escaped from the dangerous period after being sent to the hospital for treatment. The Western Deputy Detective Mike Wylund, who was shot by the bandits, is still in critical condition. The female bandit who was captured in the bandit's den, identified as Jiang Huang, was taken back to the Sixth District Police Station with the male bandit Jin Yuxiang (ie, Jin Yuxiang as recorded in yesterday's newspaper) on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and detained. The landlord of the bandit's den, Lu Zhengzhi, was also arrested. In addition, Xu Heyun, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper, was actually a mistake for Xu Nanyun. Based on Xu's confession, Chinese and Western detectives secretly went to Room 147 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII the day before yesterday and captured three accomplices, Ding Dezhao, Gu Hengshan, and Zhang Donglin. They were taken to the First Special Court yesterday morning along with the two pistols and more than thirty bullets seized in the bandit's den. After Judge Feng's brief interrogation, he ordered them to be detained separately pending joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute in Yixin Lane</h3>
<p>The houses in the area of Yixin Lane on Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, and Laohai Road are all owned by the wealthy merchant Cheng Linsheng. In August of this year, the tenants in the area suddenly received a notice from the "Gongyi Jingzu" accounting firm, stating that they had been instructed by the owner to take back the houses and ordering all tenants to move out by the end of September. Upon hearing this news, the tenants were all in a state of panic. They immediately sent a joint letter to Cheng Linsheng, requesting a delay in moving out. Later, they received a reply from Cheng, stating that the properties in the area had already been disposed of and that there was no room for negotiation. Since the owner's side could not be reasoned with, the tenants sent a letter to the Citizens' United Association and the First District Branch for assistance. They also petitioned the municipal government for relief, hoping for a fair resolution. Unexpectedly, while these actions were in progress, they suddenly received summons from the First Special District Court, scheduling a hearing for the 16th. It was then that they learned that the owner had hired a lawyer to sue them in court. As the matter had now involved the judiciary, the tenants also hired Wang Yintai, Yu Hualong, Wang Chuanbi, Zhang Heng hai and other lawyers to handle the legal procedures. It is heard that among the tenants, Rongchangxiang, China Photography Studio, and others are all well-known stores, and they have spent considerable sums of money on their businesses. This is especially true for Rongchangxiang, as the store had obtained permission from the landlord to build a third floor only a year ago, and the contract has not yet expired. Yet, they are being ordered to move out within a limited time, which is unreasonable both in terms of law and human sentiment. It also greatly impedes their future rights to lease and reside. Therefore, the tenants are determined to contend with the owner and refuse to be subjected to his economic oppression.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiusheng and Huang Qiaoxian's Marital Entanglements</h3>
<p>Yu Qiusheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 9, Tongde Lane, Zilai Street, in the French Concession, is approaching middle age but still without an heir. Therefore, he considered taking a concubine in the hope of having children to continue his ancestral line. Last May, Chen Shi's wife, an elderly woman and neighbor of Yu, introduced Huang Pan's daughter, Qiaoxian, a Shaoxing native living in Xinkang Lane, Daxinzhagu Road, to Yu as a concubine. They first arranged a meeting at Xiang Inn in the First District. Both parties agreed, and the price was set at 520 yuan, with the exchange of bracelets and rings as confirmation. However, the original matchmaker, Chen Shi's wife, was questioned by her children for arranging a concubine marriage, and she refused to continue. Yu intended to take back the betrothal gifts and call it off. However, Huang Pan's husband, Feng Bolin, took over as the responsible matchmaker, and the deal was made. After agreeing, Yu asked his friend Xu Guiqing to send the bride price to the woman's house. Both families came forward and signed a contract, each taking a copy. After receiving the bride price and contract, Huang Pan, in order to avoid the stigma of her daughter becoming a concubine, claimed that she was taking her daughter to Ningbo to get married and temporarily stayed at the Hongxiang Inn on North Nicheng Bridge. On July 13th, Yu prepared a car and went to the inn to pick up Huang's daughter and brought her to No. 9, Tongde Lane, where they began living together. She met Yu's first wife, and they addressed each other as sisters. There was no extravagant ceremony, only a banquet at the New World Hotel. On August 25th, Huang's mother took her daughter back to Ningbo for three days. Qiaoxian returned home on the 27th and, after listening to rumors, left her husband the next day, taking her clothes and belongings. When Yu returned home and found out, he immediately began searching for her and reported the incident to the police as an absconding case. The next day, Yu received a warning letter from a lawyer, and he realized that Qiaoxian had bad intentions and had been planning this for some time. On the 4th of this month, he learned that Qiaoxian was hiding in her mother's house and reported it to the police. The police dispatched detectives who arrested Qiaoxian and sent her to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court the next day. The police filed a public prosecution, and Yu Qiusheng also hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution against Qiaoxian for absconding. The lawyers representing both sides requested a postponement for an out-of-court settlement, which the court granted. However, Huang Qiaoxian then filed a lawsuit for bigamy in the First Special District Court, resulting in a jurisdictional dispute. After deliberation, the hearing was rescheduled and continued today. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court also received a summons from Judge Ma Shounan to continue the hearing. First, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, explained the case. According to the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Wang Shizong, the defendant had accused the plaintiff of bigamy in the First Special District Court, and whether this charge could stand was still in question. However, the plaintiff's actual residence was in the French Concession and should be under the jurisdiction of the court, while the defendant had no fixed address and should be noted by the court. The judge ordered that bail be posted. According to lawyer Peng Xie, the previous postponement for an out-of-court settlement was because the defendant had filed a bigamy case in the First Special District Court, resulting in a jurisdictional issue. He requested a postponement until the jurisdictional issue in the First Special District Court was resolved before proceeding with the trial. The defendant, Huang Qiaoxian, was defended by lawyer Wang Kanghou. Judge Ma then ordered the defendant to post bail, and the case was rescheduled for the 23rd of this month. The contract signed by the two parties is recorded as follows: "Female side": "Introduced by Xu Guiqing and Feng Bolin, Yu Qiusheng is approaching middle age and still without an heir. With the consent of his first wife, Chen, it is hereby decided to hold a cohabitation ceremony with Ms. Huang Qiaoxian on the ninth day of the sixth lunar month. May their love be eternal, unwavering, their happiness long-lasting, and may they grow old together." Signed by Huang Pan, the head of the Huang family. "Male side": "My younger brother, Kesheng, is approaching middle age and still without an heir." (The rest of the text is the same as above and is omitted). Signed by Yu Zuyao, the head of the Yu family, and Yu Chen, the first wife.</p>
<h3>Opening of China-America Department Store Today</h3>
<p>The China-America Department Store, located at the Xixin Bridge intersection on the Great Horse Road in the French Concession, noting the abundance of foreign and Japanese goods, has been preparing for its opening. The store has spent a considerable amount of time procuring goods and distinguishing between inferior products, paying special attention to preventing substandard items from being mixed in, which can be said to be a characteristic of the company. In addition, the store employs both male and female staff who are affable and approachable, eliminating the bad habits of old-fashioned merchants.</p>
<h3>Fire on Route des Soeurs</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday, a fire broke out in a warehouse at No. 1825, opposite the Lixing Tobacco Company on Route des Soeurs, due to carelessness. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air, and flames raged. Upon receiving the alarm, the fire brigade rushed to the scene with their pumpers and worked hard to extinguish the fire. The patrol division of the Municipal Police also dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order. After the incident, it was found that only a few boxes of tobacco leaves were burned, and there were no major losses.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>Having read a news report stating that Japanese planes have been circling the Hongqiao Road area at night, surveying our country's airfields, this rumor has been circulating for the past week. Our station believes that this news is not factual and is difficult to believe. After investigation, it was found that the light was from a searchlight emitted by a foreign warship, not from an airplane. Furthermore, airplanes cannot take off or land without proper lighting, and their flight cannot be completely silent. This letter is to clarify the matter and dispel any doubts.</p>

<h3>Reader's Correspondence</h3>
<p>Mr. Kang Jifeng's Message (Anti-Japanese Resistance Must Start with Oneself)</p>
<p>Friends, this is not the time to raise your voices and shout slogans about overthrowing the violent Japanese, nor is it the time to stand idly by and criticize the shortcomings of our countrymen. This is the time to use your calm minds, your resolute will, and your fearless spirit to prepare for a decisive battle on the battlefield or to stay behind and work hard to support the rear. Ah, friends, this is the time to take practical action. I often encounter many of you who are still engaging in empty talk without taking real action. You are well aware that our nation has deeply ingrained flaws and that we often fail to see things through to the end. Before an event occurs, we react as if we have been stung by poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts, crying out, jumping wildly, and struggling for life. But once the pain subsides, we forget everything we have experienced. Friends, I want to ask you, since you know that the root of our people's problems lies in their failure to see things through, then you should take responsibility for correcting this flaw. You should not allow this shortcoming to persist forever. But you only criticize from the sidelines and dare not step forward and take action yourselves. Have you fulfilled your national obligations? What is the difference between you and those who knowingly commit wrong? If this continues, then the day when you and your descendants are slaughtered is imminent. If you are aware of this, then stop criticizing others and resolve to start with yourselves.</p>
<p>(Reply) Mr. Kang, your letter is extremely pertinent. We hope that you and all our readers will read this letter every morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Mengxian's Message (Question about Purchasing Japanese Newspapers)</p>
<p>This is a very ordinary matter, and I ask you to answer it. I studied at a Japanese language school for two years. Although I do not have a strong foundation in Japanese, I can understand their books and newspapers quite well. Therefore, I have purchased many Japanese books and subscribed to many Japanese magazines. Recently, after the Northeast Incident occurred, the people of the whole country launched an anti-Japanese movement, boycotting Japanese goods and severing economic ties. Naturally, my blood has not yet cooled, and I am also a member of the nation. I naturally do not buy any Japanese goods. However, after the occurrence of this Northeast Incident, in order to understand the Japanese side's attitude towards us and their own situation, I have had to buy Japanese newspapers to read. When I go to a Japanese store every day to buy a copy of the "Nisshin Shimbun," I feel that I am devoid of integrity. People are working hard to boycott Japanese goods every day, but I dare to openly go to a Japanese store to buy this clearly Japanese product, the "Nisshin Shimbun." Unless I have lost my conscience, I would not buy this clearly branded Japanese product, the "Nisshin Shimbun." However, the truth is that I do not like buying the clearly branded Japanese product. I bought it in order to truly understand the Japanese side's attitude towards us in this Northeast Incident and to see their counter-propaganda. I have to grit my teeth and buy it. But I don't know whether buying Japanese newspapers to read constitutes buying Japanese goods. Should I continue to buy them in the future? Please clarify this for me and reply in your newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) Japanese books and newspapers are, of course, not included in the boycott. There is no doubt about this.</p>

<h3>Small Series on Japanese Studies by Chen Dabai</h3>
<p>Edited by the Wuxi Educational Institute</p>
<p>Japan is China's sworn enemy. The existence of Japan precludes the existence of China, and vice versa. This has been clearly proven by past events. During the Mukden Incident, the Japanese army forcibly occupied Northeast China. The entire nation, from top to bottom, was filled with indignation and anger. They sent telegrams, held meetings, and ran around appealing for help. The national mood reached a boiling point. Stories of people throwing down their pens to join the army and writing blood oaths with their fingers were everywhere. This demonstrates the rise of the national spirit. However, acting solely on emotions is not effective. Japan's aggression against China has been carefully planned for more than just a day or two. Reading Tanaka Giichi's active policy of Japanese aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia reveals the sinister intentions and enormous ambitions of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese have been oppressing us relentlessly. We can no longer tolerate it. We must always maintain a retaliatory attitude towards Japan. We must always stand in opposition to the enemy. However, if we want to wash away these many humiliations and be free from Japanese aggression one day, the most important thing is to conduct a detailed study of Japan. That is, we must understand Japan's past history, know Japan's current situation, and understand its possible future trends. There is a saying that goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." This is absolutely true. Because without knowing the truth about something, doing things blindly will not be successful. Even if it is successful by chance, it will require a great effort. If we want to reclaim our rights from Japan, and if we want to stop Japan's aggressive ambitions, then the most important thing is to analyze Japan and study it in detail, so we understand it clearly.</p>
<p>Japan's oppression of China is becoming increasingly severe. Why are they so bold? Because they have studied China clearly, knowing that China can be oppressed more and more severely. China has had to retreat step by step in the face of Japanese aggression. This is because it has paid too little attention to the real situation in Japan. Because it does not know the real situation of the other party, it does not know how to prevent aggression beforehand and does not know how to deal with it afterward.</p>
<p>The Chinese people pay too little attention to Japanese affairs. Can you say,</p>
<p>What is the population of Japan?</p>
<p>What is Japan's political system?</p>
<p>What is Japan's history?</p>
<p>What is Japan's area?</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of the Japanese people?</p>
<p>What is the size of the Japanese army?</p>
<p>What is the size of the Japanese navy?</p>
<p>What is the state of Japanese education?</p>
<p>What is Japan's economic structure?</p>
<p>What is Japan's position in Northeast China?</p>
<p>What is Japan's policy of aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia?</p>
<p>Don't say that ordinary people cannot answer the above questions and many other similar questions. Even those who have received higher education may not be able to figure them out. If you do not know this or that about others, you will suffer when you come into contact with them. To avoid this kind of suffering, we must all pull ourselves together and study Japan together.</p>
<p>Looking back at how Japan views China, Japanese people know more about China than Chinese people know about themselves in many areas. Mr. Dai Jitao said in his book "On Japan":</p>
<p>"Try going to a Japanese bookstore last year and see</p>
<p>How many books have the Japanese written about China?</p>
<p>There are thousands of books in various categories such as philosophy, literature, art, politics, economics, and society. There are hundreds of articles on "China problems" published in magazines every month. The General Staff Headquarters and the Army Ministry send dozens of personnel to China every year for long-term surveys or travel inspections. There are several series of books published in recent years alone, each volume with more than 500 pages and each series with more than 10 volumes. The Japanese don't know how many times they have dissected China on the dissection table and how many times they have tested it in test tubes. We Chinese people only reject and oppose it and refuse to do research. We almost don't even want to look at Japanese characters, listen to Japanese, or see Japanese people. This is truly "ideological isolationism" and "intellectual Boxerism."</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Gan said in "Japan No. 1," published by the Shanghai Huatong Bookstore:</p>
<p>"The reason why Japan can do whatever it wants in its aggression against China is certainly due to the strength of its army and navy and the sharpness of its weapons and warships. But what is even more alarming is their academic reconnaissance team. If we go to a bookstore in Tokyo, we don't know how many books they have written about China. Even books such as the "Complete Economic History of China" and the "Provincial Gazette of China," with their large size and comprehensive coverage, are enough to shock us. They describe in detail everything from a certain county or village in China to a certain mountain or river, how many feet high a mountain is, how wide a river is, how many people live in a certain place, what a certain place produces, statistics on production and consumption, and changes in social customs. We, who have lived in our hometowns for a long time, do not know these things, but they already know them. There are many other secret and unreleased books. Therefore, they can apply this knowledge to economic warfare and military strategies with ease."</p>
<p>After reading the above two paragraphs, what are our feelings? In reality, we should have put Japan under a microscope and conducted a detailed study, just like the Japanese studied China. Now it is already too late. We have already suffered many and great oppressions. But we must catch up and quickly study Japan clearly.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are two purposes for studying Japan. First, we want to investigate how they progressed from an oppressed state to such a strong position and see what contributions they have made in various fields of study. This purpose is to learn from their strengths for our reference. Second, we want to study Japan's various situations and devise prevention strategies from the results of these studies, and figure out how to retaliate for the tragic national humiliations of the past. For example, to defeat their economic aggression, we must know their economic organization and changes, and we must know how effective a boycott of Japanese goods is. Also, if we want to prevent their ambitions in Northeast China, how can we not know their policies and their position in Northeast China? If we want to make progress, and if we want to destroy Japan's aggression against us, we cannot wait for major humiliations to befall us before we shout slogans, distribute flyers, and send telegrams. The most fundamental work is to study, because knowledge can tell us how to prevent it beforehand and control it afterward.</p>
<p>We should pay attention to Japan at all times. We should pay special attention to Japan's ambitions to invade China.</p>
<p>Regarding Japanese research groups, there are now more and more of them due to the needs of the situation. The most famous and hardworking in Shanghai are the Japanese Research Society and the Japan Research Association. Their research has already achieved considerable results. Now I will introduce another new organization, which is the Wuxi Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute is the main base for the implementation of popular education in China, with the aim of awakening popular consciousness and raising popular knowledge. At this time of national crisis, the total mobilization of the entire people is the responsibility that those engaged in popular education should bear. Now, in addition to working hard to promote the cause in various experimental institutions, the school's Research and Experiment Department is also editing core teaching materials for anti-Japanese national salvation and organizing a research association for anti-Japanese national salvation strategies. It places even greater emphasis on the study of Japan. All teachers and students have been divided into groups to conduct research. The Small Series on Japanese Studies has already been published, and twenty titles have already been published in a very short period of time. Judging from its content, it can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>1.  Those belonging to the main theory aspect are studies of the Japanese mainland's affairs, such as Japanese history, geography, population, politics, economics, diplomacy, military, etc., such as:</p>
<p>(1) Japanese Geography</p>
<p>(2) Japanese History</p>
<p>(3) Japanese National Character</p>
<p>(4) Japanese Politics</p>
<p>(5) Japanese Economy</p>
<p>(6) Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>(7) Japanese Military</p>
<p>2.  Those belonging to the Northeast aspect are studies of Japan's past history of aggression in Northeast China and its various policies of aggression in Northeast China from now on, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's Past Aggression Against Our Country's Northeast</p>
<p>(2) The Current Situation of Japan's Aggression Against Our Country's Northeast</p>
<p>(3) Japan's Trade Policy of Aggression Against Our Country's Northeast</p>
<p>(4) Japan's Railway Policy of Aggression Against Our Country's Northeast</p>
<p>(5) Japan's Mining Policy of Aggression Against Our Country's Northeast</p>
<p>(6) Japan's Headquarters for Aggression Against Our Country's Northeast</p>
<p>3.  Those belonging to other aspects,</p>
<p>(1) History of Japanese Aggression Against China</p>
<p>(2) Economic Severance with Japan</p>
<p>(3) The Complete Story of the Wanbaoshan Incident</p>
<p>(4) The Nakamura Incident Under the Microscope</p>
<p>(5) Japan's Cultural Aggression Against China</p>
<p>Twenty titles in the Small Series have now been published.</p>
<p>The writing is simple and the narration is concise, making it very suitable for general public reading. Those engaged in popular education and patriotic movements can use this Small Series to understand the general trend of Japan, Japan's ambitions to invade our country, and how we should deal with it to resist Japan's violent acts of aggression against China and expose Japan's great ambition to invade China. Everyone should work together to overcome the national crisis and save China from deep waters and scorching fire. This is what the people of our Republic of China should know and what they should rise up to shoulder this great responsibility. This is also the great mission of editing this Small Series on Japanese Studies.</p>
<p>The series consists of twenty titles, priced at three cents per volume. The place of sale is the Research and Experiment Department of the Wuxi Provincial Educational Institute.</p>

<h3>After Seeing Jing'e's "A Heart of Patriotism"</h3>
<p>— Jing Zhi</p>
<p>To be honest, the Jing'e Drama Society was just a newborn, unknown drama troupe. But since their performance at the Lu City Exhibition, people have been astonished, exclaiming that they had almost lost a treasure. Truly, the Jing'e Drama Society is like a precious jade that has just been discovered. Personally, I believe that after this performance, the Jing'e Drama Society will surely stand firmly in the drama world, a force to be reckoned with. They have succeeded. They not only won the applause and tears of the entire audience, but also ignited the passion for national salvation and social betterment in the hearts of everyone present. Therefore, their success is not just in comparison to other drama societies at the Lu City Exhibition. Generally speaking, they can claim success without any shame. As for the reasons for their great success this time, in my personal opinion, they can be roughly divided into the following points:</p>
<p>1. At a time when the nation is facing severe difficulties, the government is unwilling to act rashly and invite trouble, maintaining a calm attitude throughout. Therefore, the responsibility of awakening the people's hearts and promoting national sentiment falls upon those who are already aware and enlightened. But to undertake this important task, effective methods are essential. The most effective method is propaganda. There are many methods of propaganda, but the most effective is the use of popular drama. The Jing'e Drama Society recognized this point and has been striving to work in this direction. This is just as they themselves said, "The significance and mission of the drama society movement are not only about technical maturity...</p>
<p>[Danish writing, possibly a name - Bing She]</p>
<p>...the greatest and most important meaning is that it can stimulate a social effect." Therefore, their great success this time is not accidental. Ordinary drama societies cannot be compared with them because they have their own beliefs. They have long understood the social phenomena and then engaged in their work. Therefore, they easily win the sympathy and empathy of the general public, and therefore, they are easy to achieve success.</p>
<p>2. Adopting popular and meaningful plays is also one of the reasons for their success. Originally, plays should be taken from the common people, so that our efforts can plant a clear image of seedlings in the hearts of the general audience. Otherwise, the audience will be fundamentally vague about the play, and of course, there will be no question of understanding or not. This is a defeat from the start. I don't remember which drama society it was, but they performed a play called "What is the First Sound?" But in the end, no matter what kind of meaning you have, it cannot be understood by the general audience, so it ended in a few hisses. From this, we can further prove that choosing a popular play is essential. But it should be noted that being only popular is not enough. At the same time, we must pay more attention to the quality – it must be meaningful. For example, the play "A Heart of Patriotism" adopted by the Jing'e Society this time not only does not violate the popular condition, but also fully reveals the psychological concepts of the conflict of interests between two different ethnic groups, etc., making everyone establish a belief that to save their own nation, even any sacrifice can be disregarded. This is the second reason why the Jing'e Drama Society has been so successful.</p>
<p>3. The completeness of the talent has contributed to the success of the performance, which is a well-known fact. This time, the Jing'e Drama Society, in this regard, I believe they must have put a lot of effort into it. Take the leading role of Qiu Zi, Ms. Jin Guangmei, for example. She is an extremely socialized new woman. She is not only endowed with literary cultivation, but also full of revolutionary enthusiasm, coupled with her delicate and meticulous expressions, rich and profound stage experience (it is said that she played the leading role in plays such as "The Play" and "The Shrew" three or four years ago), and clear and fluent speech. What is especially rare is that she can completely forget herself and empathize with the character in the play, and the performance is truly seamless. With such a versatile and rare all-rounder, how can she not win so much applause? The success of the Jing'e Drama Society owes a lot to Ms. Jin. Secondly, in terms of female actors, Ms. Gao Yunzhang, who plays Zhou Zhifang, is also a promising theatrical talent. Her facial expressions, especially her calm and powerful eyes, and her proper behavior, all indicate that she has a talent for acting.</p>
<h3>Beside the Rockery</h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<p>It is a pity that she has too little stage experience, and perhaps because of her age, she is sometimes a little too childish. Also, Ms. Liu Sifen, who plays Ya Nan, is also an impeccable person. She, like Ms. Jin, has the magic power to make people like, hate, love, and cry. It is just that her Mandarin is a little too poor. As for Ms. Wang Shu, who plays Aunt Tian, she is also not bad. Although she speaks the local dialect of the Huaiyang area, it is precisely because she plays a maid – Aunt Tian, so this is not very incompatible with the position of the character she plays. As for the male actors, except for Mr. Song Xunlun, who plays Tang Huating, the other two can only be said to be average. This is a shortcoming that the society has neglected. In short, on the whole, they are all very competent, and none of them made our audience feel disappointed. This is the third reason why they – the Jing'e Drama Society – have been so successful.</p>
<p>In summary, the success of the Jing'e Drama Society is certainly beyond the reach of ordinary comrades who are only envious of this movement. At the same time, in the society itself, I think the gentlemen who preside over the society are indeed worthy of our admiration. Now I say a word of encouragement to everyone. I hope that the gentlemen of the Jing'e Drama Society will not be satisfied with this success, but should strive to move forward and work hard, following the three definite goals that you have clearly recognized.</p>
<p>Finally, I bless the Jing'e Drama Society and wish them even greater success.</p>

<p>The bloodshed of the May 3rd Massacre has not dried,</p>
<p>The negotiations of Wanbaoshan have not been completed,</p>
<p>Japanese cannons bombard Shenyang City again,</p>
<p>Japanese fierce soldiers occupy the three northeastern provinces again,</p>
<p>Watching,</p>

<p>Are you willing to be slaves to a foreign country?</p>

<p>What Japan relies on is,</p>
<p>Fierce guns,</p>
<p>Can't it be resisted?</p>
<p>And look, the tension in the national atmosphere,</p>
<p>The excitement of the 200,000 citizen assembly,</p>
<p>The courage of 8,000 student soldiers petitioning,</p>
<p>As long as the economic relationship with Japan is severed,</p>
<p>It can be brought to its death,</p>
<p>Compatriots,</p>
<p>Are you willing to be slaves to a foreign country?</p>
<p>No, no, no... Absolutely not,</p>
<p>Unite and resist Japan,</p>
<p>Fight on, persevere to the end,</p>
<p>"Severing economic ties with Japan" is successful,</p>
<p>Japan is panicked and fearful</p>
<p>Opened the warship,</p>
<p>Demonstration, oppression, intimidation,</p>
<p>We have also resisted Japan in the past,</p>
<p>Without determination,</p>
<p>And it was destroyed halfway,</p>
<p>"Five minutes of heat,"</p>
<p>Don't let foreigners laugh at us forever,</p>
<p>The heroic souls of the martyrs are praying underground,</p>
<p>Compatriots,</p>
<p>Are you willing to be slaves to a foreign country?</p>
<p>No, no, no... Absolutely not,</p>
