<p>時評</p>
<h3>這一年</h3>
<p>一年來的經濟（下）</p>
<p>（二）民族的工商業的衰落。自世界經濟轉入第三時期。愈益加緊對中國的搾取。和中國農業加速其崩潰的過程之展開。中國的工商業。也與農業同様的陷入悲慘的絕境。一息奄奄幾至不能自存。</p>
<p>由於絲的銷路之停滞。國內絲廠業。都以維持難。相率停工就上海一埠言。共有二萬九千部絲車。各廠存繭約一萬担。均抵押在金融機關內現僅有愼昶餘·盈豐·鑫元隆·興綸·等二十餘家勉强摚持停歇的約有八十餘家失業男女工人在五萬以上。浙蘇鎭各埠開工的不過十家。無錫僅十。四家廣東絲廠情形。亦復相類失。業工人總數至少在十萬以上。絲廠業生機幾。於完斷絕。由於外資的壓迫。曾於去年與外廠作劇烈竸爭。的我國紡織業也根本發生動搖。如一九三○年。我國共有紡織工廠八十一。有錠錠數二、三二六、八七二枚。一年內日商增加紡機十三萬錘。織機三千架。我國則亦增設。紡機五萬錘。織機二百五十架。當然。這竸爭很顯然是失敗。而到今年上半年有紗錠二萬餘枚。的厚生紗廠。和有紗錠七萬枚的。三新紗廠。都被外商收買了紡織。業之不振。可見一斑。雖説自萬案發生以來。因我國排。斥日貨運之激化日紡織廠遭受鉅大的打擊。使我國內紡織業暫。時抬頭但這是一種特殊的。暫時的情勢。復以金價狂跌。外匯日鬆。外棉。傾銷我國內棉產又因水災歉收廠商多一致進價廉質美之美印棉故下半年國內紡織業。表面上雖有抬頭之勢。而究實際則。基　愈日益削弱。加以日紡織廠停滞失業工人。且又因而陡增。再如麫粉業。現在全國生產額。若開全工。每日爲二十五萬包較三年前出二十萬包。生產率已增加百分之二十但以原料不足銷路不廣。各廠開工期間。只有五個月。其餘七個月只開半工。麫粉業停滞的情况。已可槪見如火柴業。如捲烟工廠。因原料恐慌及外商壓迫。早已奄奄垂斃。至於在重工業方面。煤鑛業和鋼鐵業早已被日英帝國主義所操縱。是無可諱言的事實今年雖以排斥日貨給予國有重工業絕好發展的機會。但因我國重工業。毫無基礎。故反而引起煤的恐慌風潮。實業部且因此而在京召集煤。荒曾議我國重工業的凋零。已可槪見。他如航業多被外國運輸企業所操。縱招商局幾經破產。航空運輸。無論是旣成未成航綫。多由美國資本支配着這是一年來我國民族工業衰落的情况。</p>
<p>至於商業。我國海外貿易本年爲。入超近年出口大宗的茶絲等項銷路停滞。貿易尤極不振。據十一月份統計。十月份出口總值共爲。一八·四七五·三二○海關兩除去復進口土貨價值一三六○三海關兩。計出口凈值一八·四六一·七一七海關兩。而在另一方面則我國內市。塲更幾乎整個爲帝國主義者商品所獨占。本年雖以排斥日貨運動之激化。十月間日本對華貿。易。已减少一萬五千萬之鉅但英國。則取其地位而代之加。以英金本位停止金價跌落。其對華貿易。更驟形激增。據英商務部發表。統計一九三一年四月至七月一季對華輸出共值一·七三五·○○○鎊對香港輸出共值六八七·○○○鎊。七月至十月一季。則。對華增至一·七六六·○○○鎊對香港亦增至一·三三一·○○○鎊。前北。平英使署。商務參贊福克斯斯士。在帝國協會會議演説。謂於兩國間的商業。頗抱樂觀躊。躇滿志可以想見總之由於（甲）農村經濟之加速崩潰。與民族工業之衰落。使農民生活極端貧困化城市失業人數增加。國力購買力亦因之極度降。低由於（乙）共產黨與土匪騷擾區域之擴大。以及運輸系。統大規模的破壞使商品流通發。生絕大的障碍。市塲異常的縮小嚴格的説目前我國內商品。能流通的區域僅。剩有沿海和長江珠江等流域一带火車輸船到逹的區域和幾個。大的都市由於（丙）外商的竸爭與排擠。并利用我國世界唯一最低。關税率以施行探併。政策。及相率停止金本位。减低金價以减低商品的價格高壓我國。的工商業自然我國內的市塲。也完全爲「洋貨」所佔據。所以就海外市塲言我國。固無處</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>可以插足。就國內市塲言。亦日益縮小。那末我國的商業。　有地位可言嗎。</p>
<p>（三）都市的澎脹。近年以來。特别是今年。我國都市在金融方面以及在人口方面。都感到極度的澎脹。然而這澎脹是一種畸形發展的病熊的現象。因爲他並非全由於商業資本的利潤之搾取。而其最大原因還是由於土匪與共產黨之驅逐。因爲土匪與共產黨之騷擾。一般有產者甚至小康之家。都席捲其所有。逃到安全的都市來。而將所有的錢。都存入銀行裏去。近年來。特别是今年大水災以後。各都市人口的激增。是很顯然的事實。而金融的集中。則於下面諸事實中。亦可窺見。（甲）國內雖經濟凋敝。而銀行事業反日益發達。如今年有滬友邦銀行發行平安分紅短期儲蓄。綢業銀行。企業銀行開始營業。寗波銀行華懋銀行正在籌備。各銀行都設支行。中央銀行添設北平。辦事處。交通銀行津區儲蓄部國貨銀行津分行開幕。冀農商銀行召開復業股東會。瀋鹽業銀行籌備開幕。徐州國民銀行召集增資股東會。重慶中國銀行添設貨棧。河北民生銀行將成立。温州永嘉縣籌設農民銀行。福建地方實業銀行復業。桂省籌備恢復廣西省銀營業。渝川康殖業銀行擴充擴充營業黑官銀號在長設辦事處天津中原商業儲蓄銀行開幕。等舉不勝舉（乙）各銀行貨幣發行額。八月份較七月份增加。九月份較八月份增加。常呈增加之現。象凡此貨幣資本的擴張與銀行事業之發達。都爲都市金融澎脹之反證明。不過在此我們不要忽略了一個奇特的現象。即資本主義的關係（貨幣關係）日益擴大。而資本主義的生產却緊的衰落。這原因是由於資本逃向大都市的銀行家手裏。銀行家吸入鉅大的現金。不用之於發展工商。業改進農業却盡用之於地產投機及金子公債等等買空賣空之交易事業上海近年以來的地產價格。突呈飛涨。轉手之間。却可獲得鉅大之赢利。而各種公儥行市。亦動搖起伏。利息甚至超過四分。且銀行家不僅不利用澎脹的現金發展工商業。却反用極高利率的債權吞併了中國垂斃的民族工業。如上述的絲廠。將存絲全部押給銀行團。以及所謂絲業公債航業公債組織航業銀行等即其例證。貨幣資本統治了工業增加了脆弱的工業。之迫害。它自日趨於腐朽衰落。永遠抬不起頭。次之。在農村經濟破產的情勢下掙扎的農民。他爲着想死守其土地。不惜以飲鴆止渴的方法。典押田產或靑苗以及種農產品。承受銀行錢莊以及銀行的代理人極高利率的貸欵。此一事實又使資本倒流入農村。不過它在事實上並未改進農業經濟。却正是造成一個輸送管的系統。更加緊榨取貧窮化了的平民大衆的血汗。由此一輸送管吸收到都市來。另一方面。復由商品輸入。軍火購買存儲以及投機事業等一切道路輸送到外國財政資本的銀庫裏去。例如因九一八東省禍變爆發。我國內現金鉅額流出。頓使市塲銀根吃緊。即其一證。所以中國都市的澎脹。是一種畸形的現象。牠是中國國民經濟總崩潰的過程的另一種方式。</p>
<p>（四）在這様的情勢之下國家財政自感到非常的困絀收入與支出發生絕大的平衡。各省市的財政也同様瀕於破產。政府爲此一現象。極費周章當去年年底國內大戰結朿之後。政府企圖復興經濟。在事實上有各種的表現。建設口號再度提高。四中全會通過刷新政治案。以及舉行全國經濟會議。十萬萬的銀借欵的計劃等。都表示政府對於復興經濟的熱望與努力。然而依據今年一年來新的事實而觀察。此種希望與努力。終歸於慘痛的失敗。而且更以銀借欵的爭持。在國內又引起分裂的局勢。</p>
<p>一年來我國經濟界所發生的現象。大槪如上所述。一言以蔽之一九三一年爲中國經濟的一大刦運經此刦運。中國經濟愈瀕於破產。中國平民大衆日益窮困化愈。以沉没於水深火熱之深淵而末由自拔。</p>
<p>目前政治局面變換。新政府行將成立。很顯然的復興中國經濟的一企圖。又將死灰復燃。四届一中全會閉幕宣言中有云。「大會認爲尙有急需注意者因生產衰落而社會經濟逐漸崩潰。因社會經濟崩潰而失業日多。因失業日多而赤匪之燄張。因赤匪之燄張而生產更益衰落因果相。循迴環不已腹心之患甚於外敵。大會對此認爲應安定操之自我無損國權應用國外資。本技能。以發展國家生產。實現總理實業計劃之方針」大聲疾呼詞意堅定利用外資。以恢復中國經濟今後或將爲新政府努力的。　的　時有此時期另一方面的事寳。則爲去年包辦十萬萬銀借欵之美人林百克。又將來華。銀借欵將有舊事重提之可能。國聯交通部長哈斯亦將由滬去京。應我國政府聘請。對交通建設有具體計劃。關於導淮治黃疏　掦子江俱擬有意見。備府採用。而且在不久以前。據報紙所載。捷克且有人計劃聯合十二農業國成立一大農業托拉斯。一方面中國正急需外國投資。而另一方面已陷於動搖崩潰情勢之下的資本主義國家。也正積極計劃開發中國。以紆解世界資本主義的危機。國際聯盟的衛生部長萊蔓。先後曾來中國四次。他爲歐美的資本家專門研究中國財政事宜的一位代表人物。代表美國資本家的拉孟德氏曾説。「爲了中國財政的根本的整理和產業開拓。而實行大規模的借欵。正是美國所希望的。『最足以引起我們注意的。還有自國際聯盟發出的「經濟復興自中國』的口號。這些零碎的事實。和片繼的發言。我們不要忽略了。須得過細玩味。切實認淸。我們固然盻望中國經濟能得復興。但同時我們也忘不了國際實施於匈牙利的計劃。一九三二的中國經濟之序幕。將如何展開。如何轉捩。讓大家去思考去推斷罷。</p>

<h3>紅隊射籃欠準</h3>
<p>紅隊表演、亦驚人之至、前錄之活動力强極、以　漢生最出色、兩江後衛、時見顧此失彼、惟射籃欠準而無把握、實爲失敗之因、失去機會不少、後衛亦防守甚嚴、故棋逢敵手、實爲本季最精彩之一幕、</p>

<h3>全看下週决賽</h3>
<p>今兩江紅隊划船三隊各敗一次、麥令則已敗二次、下週兩江逢划船、紅隊逢麥令、兩江紅隊如皆勝、則兩隊再行决賽、兩江與埠令勝、則兩江錦標、故皆望麥令勝紅隊、而江勝划船也、</p>

<h3>驅國難文</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>唯民國二十年大除夕。謹以三寸毛錐子。握之前驅。申告於國難之　曰。東北封疆。非。不足以限倭宼之兵鋒。而任其蹂躪矣。東北兵力。非不足以與敵一戰。大張撻伐。而任其實偪處此。入我堂奥矣。以致暴日狡焉思啓。蕩搖我遼瀋。侵奪我北大。憑陵我津沾。幕爾三島。儼然與我中國爭衡。自開衅以迄於茲。已逾百日已。固由我國家之統一未成。亦邊圉之捍衛無資。實無可諱。今我統一之新政府成立矣。其涉政地而敷布於時者。當靡不栗栗危擢。仁人志士。臥薪嘗膽。以冀一雪國恥之大政也。行見專閫之威。必有所假。征討之律。必有所憑。則執鞭弭以周旋。奉旌徽而右吾知東隣小醜。出其不意。有駭竄不遑焉耳。嗚呼。擬密須之受封功收失地。等衡陽之祭禡。靈乞行師。故聞紞紞之音。輒思桓桓之度。爰媵以辭曰。東灜之水兮勢汪洋。維彼土兮蓬萊鄕。矮奴倭子兮何披猖。蠶食鯨呑兮我實傷。迺申征伐之號令兮。屏諸遐方。命塞外之將領傳檄兮。母遲疑而徬徨。俾息硝烟而撥毒霧兮。願炮火之潛藏。冀邦交之恢復兮。修親善於約章。尊國聯以盟好兮。保唇齒以相將。洵島國之福祉兮。長與我乎相忘。慶東亞之和平兮。留此後日月一綫之曙光</p>
<h3>憤書</h3>
<p>— 魏文希</p>
<p>刦棋感憤推枰。回首三邊拔幟驚。松杏山空無戰骨。幽燕風緊带秋聲。軍中尙有捐生志。城下難爲俯首盟。只怕相煎　豆急。後先恩怨不分明。</p>
<p>鎭錀憑誰擊北門。防秋多口怨王孫。國當屠弱無全策。劍負横磨有罪言。都向河山魂共斷。漫誇壇　舌猶存。英雄原不關成敗。玉碎終非瓦比論。</p>
<p>揖讓談兵竟若何。當機失斷悔蹉跎。難隴右劉都護。愁煞壺頭馬伏波。未必擋天憑一木。可憐待救困三河。唐封勃利空佳話。悵望窮邊涕涙多。</p>
<p>秋風蕭瑟捲邊塵。關外河山失陷頻。自是長城無道濟。居然薦食有豐臣。國人憤慨將驅市。虜馬縱橫已問津。著盡愁顏何日破。問吟出塞雜酸辛。</p>
<h3>羊奶與蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 一</p>
<p>甘地的羊奶列席英印圓桌會議的甘地。他每日必需的羊奶飲料。這回在倫敦舉行英國酪農品評定會中。竟得了第一等　賞。聽説所賞的是一條綠色彩带。這彩带結在羊的項上。并且正式稱他的名也呌甘地了。據評定會的職員</p>
<p>一德氏。對審查員説道。『自從甘地到倫敦以來。從前很不注意的山羊。到了現在</p>
<p>。一天一天飛漲價值。因爲社會上崇拜甘地的人們。都效法甘地要吃羊奶了。』</p>
<p>飛機上的蜜蜂從馬賽飛到巴黎的飛機。前幾天有一位旅客。带着一箱蜜蜂。因爲受了機器的震動。這蜜蜂箱的蓋。突然脱開。箱裏的蜜蜂飛散于司機室和旅客室內。那司機有和旅客的面上手上。被蜜蜂叮得好像螞蟻咬蒼蠅一般。幸虧司機人戴了一副防風砂的眼鏡。也管不得旅客的喊呌。且也不去擈打那蜜蜂。所以蜜蜂亦不傷及司機人。因此得以平安飛到巴黎。可是有幾位旅客的面部。已爲羣蜂鰲傷了。</p>
<h3>秋蝶膠東説夢還</h3>
<p>— 楊吉孚</p>
<p>胡蝶女士與鄭正秋張巨川潘毅華三先生。最近應山東大戲院之請。特來靑島舉行開幕典禮。適逢社會局籌辦冬賑游藝會。商請參加表演。事屬善舉義不容辭。正秋遂將説夢舊本詳加增改。盡一夜之功而成。此劇原係獨角戲。今加入陸蓮兒李大榮羅一翁羅從新四人。黄老大改名陸老老共爲五人。曲折益多。胡蝶飾運兒。正秋先飾大榮。後飾陸老老。另有兩君臨時加入。飾一翁從新。蓋寫蓮兒爲一貧苦少女。受富宦李大榮之欺。認爲義女。隨往北方。寄居某王府。八年某日。大榮偕游舊友羅一翁私園威嚇利誘。欲逼爲妾。蓮兒堅不允。正爭執時。大榮聞一翁呼聲。不得不入室晤談。一翁子從新亦在園內。聞蓮兒哭。詳詢來歷原委。而未察逼女爲妾。即係大榮。遂勸妇求學。而懇大榮資助。當此之時。因皆未提及姓名。不獨蓮兒不知從新所求者爲大榮。即大榮亦不知求學少女即其心目中之妾。結果三人對面方悟錯中又錯。大榮盛怒。正欲動武。一翁自室內出。　悉本末。因與大榮劃地絕交。大榮旣去。忽圍丁陸老老　眉如雪。揥葉高歌而過。一翁詢以何故高歌。答曰。不歌則必欠入夢。而夢境惡劣可怕。以不願入夢。故歌以正之。并詳言夢得西鄰頻來欺凌。而束鄰侵犯尤甚。持刃痛　。竟削支二十一條。後且扼我咽喉·必欲致我於死地。故我思若再貪睡不醒。必遭毒手。特奉勸同胞。可以猛醒矣。言已。高歌二曲。痛切時病。勿再自私自利。爭權奪位。歌已。蓮兒急趨前痛哭曰。是非阿父耶。兒思父久矣。骨肉相見。悲不自勝。擬控大榮於法院。願以所科罰金悉數助賑。復懇一翁以積餘之財。多多捐助。救濟貧民。幕遂　。善哉善哉。正秋之立意也。以説夢一節。驚醒同胞。毛骨聳然。最後回到助賑本題。確當之至。胡蝶於躊躇爲難之際。表現出弱女子無主張之神情。極台身分。哭述凄凉家世。一斷一續。一字一　。有頓挫。有氣勢。博得全塲同情心不少。可謂善於表情者也。説夢舊本余曾請正秋公演有三四次之多。别後三年。不圖忽於靑島得睹菘增善後之公演。益覺欣幸不置。正秋老當益壯。其供獻於世人者亦愈殷。今正秋一行已抵滬。爰作秋蝶膠束説夢還以長之。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>歲暮偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱寛</p>
<p>國難日亟。排愁無計。疇昔之日。困偕潘貞華謝瑤華二女士。赴卡爾登觀電影。觀罷出院已逾七時。是日天氣陰寒。乃同詣福州路南園小酌。菜肴盈前。談笑甚歡。惟三人都不善飮。啜靑梅酒少許。已不能勝。餐曅。醺然欲出。曲折經樓頭走廊。謝女士衣行。暼見壁間聯語。笑引吾儕視之。聯云。「小酌邀佳客。醺顏醉六郎」嘻。抑何巧合之甚也。蓋余於昆仲間適行六。又新與潘女士締婚。佳客謝女士。多才多藝。爲謝公泗亭之幼女公子。繩祖仲和兩兄之今妹。卒業於中西女塾。嘗從西樂師學。精鋼琴。綺年玉貌。而好學不倦。中西文造詣俱深。善吹笛。能度崑曲。淸歌一折。有繞梁三日之槪。又能作行書及擘窠大篆字。從老書師馮超然先主學國畫。山水人物花卉均擅長。邇復廷師於家。肆力詩詞之學。余嘗於潘女士處。見其畫。筆致淸逸絕俗。䟦以行　爲之。亦珠圓玉潤。逈異凡筆。聞方趕製書屏四幅。爲潘女士添妝。閨閣奇才。不可多得。豈天地靈秀之氣。亦必擇人而施耶。謂爲佳客。殊無愧焉。（酬助華洋義</p>

<h3>補記邱菽園</h3>
<p>— 丘斌存</p>
<p>昨閲自由談所載鄭逸梅君所寫之『割讓臺灣時之邱菽園』。殊多錯誤與遺漏。特就我與菽老之關係。撰爲此文。藉以訂正鄭文及補鄭君之所不逮。</p>
<p>丘菽園。號嘯虹生。前淸舉人。舉康有爲梁啓超相友善。唱和頻仍。反正後。數百萬之家財。蕩然無存。入民國。長居新加坡。自謂星洲寓公。星洲（新加坡通稱）一名。自菽園命名始。與林文慶博士創辦中國女子學校。自爲批課卷。華人在新加坡之有此英文女校。應歸功於菽老。自民　至民十年間。擔任香港華字日報特約撰稿。以資餬口。壯士暮景如此。情可哀矣。由民十　至民十五年間。在新加坡與轉道和尙等。創立詩社。菽老之生活費。間受故友與寺院之津貼。其窮乏可知。所著詩。除鄭君所舉者外。尙有嘯虹生詩鈔一集。散文尙有揮汗拾　。等民十七至民十八。恒家居著作詩文。發表於南洋各報上。民十八年星洲日報出世。菽老被聘主編其副刋『繁星』。是年末。余自馬來聯邦歸國。道經星洲。曾謁菽老。承出示一生所藏之家珍。並轉贈某藝術家所貽之阿房宫瓦字體之『丘子長生』之小印一。以我亦丘族之一也。民十九年。與歐陽雪峯等。倉創辦南洋書畫社。此兩年中之南洋書畫月刋上。亦每有菽老之文章。</p>
<p>菽老有女二。長女名鳴權。以女詩人而兼畫家。適王盛治君。王爲北大政經系學生。有才名。堪稱菽老之快壻。菽老無子。就我國嗣續觀念言。未免遺憾。</p>
<p>梁紹文君在中華　局出版之南洋游記中。稱菽老爲『二十年前南洋唯一的維新人物』誠非過譽。因鄭文有『旋病殁』句。其實菽老今仍健在。惟生活頗窮蹙耳。</p>
<p>出版界消息茲有出版界巨子多人。組織一每週出版社。擬循環發行不同性質之週報七種。在成立之初。决先出版一社會週報。現正在籌備中。通訉處在愛文義路廣仁里一五八○號。凡有願任特約撰述或有其他週報之計劃者。均可通函接洽云。</p>
<h3>一個白手立業的江北人（下）</h3>
<p>— 張孝若</p>
<p>悼沈卓吾</p>
<p>這一回大德繼大吉又被全焚·吾人精神上當然十分難受。人家因此怨雖公司。我們是萬分　　引咎的因若此而責望我們以後　飭改進。力保乘客的生命安全。我們也誠意　受的。復此都　以光明純　爲立塲。要知我們分司財產上的鉅大損失。人事上的糾紛苦痛。也是絕不願意</p>
<p>有的。而那不可測的鉅禍竟從天降臨了又豈人們所能預知呀。而且中國航業許多應改革奮勉愈起直追的地方。實在大多數是一様的。我們固然不能因此卸責。然人家也應有机賞的體</p>
<p>現在還有人想謂交通部立即停止大還公司營業。這就節外生枝。溢出　　了。試　交通事業。如　　·輪船·飛機·那一様能　保他必不出事不幸一出事。即要將整個公司停止營業。恐怕交通部不能開這個先例罷。世界上也找不到任一國有這修法律罷。</p>
<p>我近年關了門。專心編著父書·也不　風在那個方向吹。冰霜世事。歌哭生涯。我是飽嘗而深味的了。很想結束以往的風　。歸於異常的平淡。性情不知怎的忽然孤僻起來。從不願和人多而。尤其不願和熟人見而。雖然人家不一　對於我和幾年前不同。然而我自己總神經過敏。討没趣似的。所以我近年自常在上海以來。從没有機會和卓吾見過而。可卓吾總慇　得很。時常托人寄聲問　并且有二三次親自來過人都不在家。没有遇見。早知如此。我無論怎様也得和他多見幾　了。</p>
<p>卓吾還有白髮高年的老母在堂。寡妻和弱子都待　養敎　歲月方長。當然是我們後死者的責任。義不容辭的我很想集合了卓吾的朋友　玉虎孫哲生鄭詔覺諸兄合刀謀盡。以惠逝者。還</p>
<p>想募案一筆欵子。　卓吾做一個紀念。怎様可以適當而永久。且待與各方友好商榷後再定。卓吾的　遇。在他的朋友中。當然我是　沈痛。而心是最不安的。　　自後出事到今。也將近十天了。卓的下落。消息還是沈　呀。生還果眞無望。屍體又找不到。　是快人快死落個乾凈滔滔的長江連着茫茫的大海。都是卓吾葬身之所了。然而我們總　希望卓吾能回來。至少他的英魂回來回來呀（民國二十年十二月十九日　香港）</p>

<h3>河下米市轉緊</h3>
<p>滬南昨日來源三十號左右、交易呆滞、厚　　行情暫守原盤、　　到　無多、寗周亦薄、洋在尖去路微細、呈波軟之象、　元　　店交易極好、大盤　起一二角、洋　產價不划、人心看定、河下斛脚一千石之譜、</p>
<p>新閘斛脚雖　、但零多　少、大盤工落有限、西新頂價同前盤、中　硬起角許、早晚稻尙稱穩定、杜埠尖交易寥寥、無听榮辱、客尖隨到隨銷、形　略提數分、變二元　作坊需要尙殷、斛價硬起角許、西路來船四五十號、</p>
<h3>現洋米客化又淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因漢口帮停辦、市面又轉呆木狀態、統市祇有本街應　小絞米二百包、價　九元九角、貨品雖見略次、但已比前市小去五六分矣、期米洋行續有抛出、回頗貨亦有三四百噸、新交易者計捷成抛出二月份高小絞一千噸、價四兩四錢半、又喴厘出二月份小絞七百噸、價四兩三錢、源興出馬來島米一百噸、價四兩九錢半</p>
<h3>糖市劃盤各糖一致轉挺</h3>
<p>抛貨荷糖又見續開</p>
<p>昨糖市產區電訉古巴現糖價爲一·一二五、</p>
<p>比較前電回升二一二五紐約期糖明年度三月份一·一=、比升二分、五月份一·一七、九月份一·二八、亦各升一分、爪哇現期糖依然無升沉、公會市塲劃盤　氣殊堅、但以翌日封關、故交易均靜、荷糖二十四號粗砂白價升九兩六錢、黁細砂白九兩七錢、出户且缺、趨勢殊俏、太古糖進出亦懈、Ｂ嘜十一兩七錢二分半、ＨＸ　十一兩五錢半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩四錢、市形亦殊堅穩、抛貨荷糖有求新　售出二三月份　船八號荷赤一百噸、價荷幣四元八角半、　　洋行開粗砂白價五</p>
<p>元一角一分二五、聞已售開二百噸、尙須回電作數云、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>海外白廠經來價仍小</h3>
<p>Ｂ　級價均跌進八百兩關</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、疲　如故、滬白廠經海外雖有電轉、而來價仍小、紐約Ｂ級八十一·二分伊文奈司（即匀度）、里昂十三至十五條份價</p>
<p>均跌八百兩關、廠方每包須虧本二三百兩、仍鮮抛售、昨祇連納等進黃廠經二十包、達昌等進白乾經十包、價均平疲云、</p>
<h3>乾繭銷淸價堅</h3>
<p>廠進沉寂繭本須凈扯八百兩</p>
<p>白廠經　銷久　　　　、　廠棠已陷　絕望、蘇浙各　絲廠停業者已　十分之八、乾關原料　　益　、廠進沉寂、而餘　客開價仍堅、日昨閘北某絲廠補充秋　缺貨、成交三十五抯、繭本仍須凈　八百兩、外加　工等絲本每包須一千兩以上、廠方忽痛補購云、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢新貨續有到申</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢市面、仍趨疲弱、除本街有零晨交易外、其餘客路絕少大宗開出、洋行明年新貨、如　　·直貢·花呢·華特呢·巧克丁·兩衣布等、日日</p>
<p>來續有到申、浦東西一各棧均有相當提存云、</p>

<p>日前由　東輪船裝來賈汪　三千餘　、已於昨日卸畢、午後市塲盤價、亦已開出、計統煤十兩五錢、煤　八兩五錢云、</p>
<h3>五金靑鉛重起漲風</h3>
<p>靑鉛行情、昨售十四兩、比前重超漲風、雖提高之數不大、但不可不爲萎靡不振期中之五金好消息也、其媾户爲河南帮、而本街兵工廠昨亦</p>
<p>有鉅數點缀、總計全日成交共達六七百担、而土鉛行情、昨受洋鉛回漲之激動、故亦好起錢餘、</p>
<p>售十三兩五錢、惟交易不甚衆多耳、</p>
<h3>白鐵瓦現貨不多</h3>
<p>白　瓦所到現貨爲數不多、所以標準開價、比之平白鐵反覺挺秀、刻市二十四號每擔售十一兩二錢半、二十六號十二兩、二十八號十三兩查市上買賣、當推二十八號二十六號爲　踴躍、</p>
<p>二十四號則因機關上不辦、所以成交較爲冷落耳、</p>
<h3>新鉛絲存底單薄</h3>
<p>新鉛絲近來交易雖不見十分興旺、但來貨不多、積存早感單薄、所以標凖尙覺挺秀、刻市每擔售十二兩七錢半、細花色售十八兩五錢、查昨市開出共有七八百擔、惟市上現貨因此益　　條、苟後市交易重趨興旺、則前途標準當再步漲風也、</p>

<p>肺癆療法之新發見德國肺病療養雜誌抄譯</p>
<h3>何謂肺癆菌？</h3>
<p>肺結核（即肺癆菌。）係檡狀之　菌。其體形眞直。或稍　曲。長徑約一迷達之百萬分一五。非肉眼所以見。據一定之方法。以熟練之手段。製爲染色標本。用六百倍至一千倍之　黴竸檢視之。始克窺知。賣爲極小之物也。</p>
<p>古昔時。中國名之曰　咳蟲。現今則人皆知結核菌爲肺病之蟲不屬於動物界之系統。蓋吾人之周圍。有無數之下等黴生物存在。即通稱么黴機體。爲肉眼所不能見。此么黴有機體。分爲勳物性與植物性二種。屬於勳物性者曰原始蟲。屬於植物性者曰黴菌。此下等下等植物之黴菌。屬於　化植物之科。無葉　。素黴菌之中又視形狀性質。分爲『絲狀黴菌』『芽</p>
<p>性黴菌』『分裂黴菌』之三　。</p>
<h3>肺癆菌之殖民政策</h3>
<p>分裂微菌之繁殖。本諸自身之分裂作用。即自一而化寫二自二化寫四。日漸增加。故有分裂微菌之稱人類及他稱。勳物。往往因之　生疾病。·故稱曰『病原菌』因形狀之不同，又分爲『球狀微菌』『桿狀微菌』『蠂旋狀黴菌』之三種。肺癆菌印分裂黴菌中之桿狀菌。肺癆菌。在肺病患者之痰中。混炎最多。常視患者病勢二輕重。而有增　。據德國海角雷兒　慱士謂。肺病患者之痰一塊中。含有三萬萬之结核菌故小時內咯痰一次。者一盡夜中有七十二萬萬之結核菌。自結核患者之體內而排出。散布於空氣中。世間之人。日夜被其　　。然此多數之病菌。果何自而生乎。蓋分裂菌之本體。有分裂作用。已如前述其。日漸增加繁殖者職是之故。起始時原屬一個黴菌。其後日漸分裂。由一爲二。由二爲四。依次遞推。增殖之勢力。日漸廣大。今試假定增殖之速力。每一小時。營分裂作用一次。則二十四小時內。一個之徽菌。已化爲一千六百萬個矣由是以觀。則下述之事項。可推測而知。　　（一）黴菌繁殖力之如何旺盛</p>
<p>（二）究因何故而患者之體中。發無數病菌。</p>
<p>（三）患者之痰。究因何故而有無數之肺結核菌。</p>
<h3>肺癆菌之抵抗力</h3>
<p>肺結核菌之抵抗力。非常强盛。推知其抵力之大小。爲肺病豫防及治療上之最緊要者。結核患者之痰。放置空氣中時。結核徽菌之生存。可達半年以上。置於光線缺乏之暗室內。則一年以上。得保其生存此種黴菌。封於寒冷之抵抗力。尤爲强大。遇攝氏零下十度二寒冷。經六七星期而不死。對於温熱二抵抗力。亦較他種黴菌菌爲强。他種黴菌。遇攝氏六十度</p>
<p>之温度。經二三十分鐘。便行死滅。而此種徽菌。須八十度。二温度經二三十分鐘。始克死滅。惟對於日光之抵抗力。最爲荏弱。過直射日光。經五六分鐘便死。遇攝氏百度以上之温熱。一二分鐘便死。若就消毒　而論。肺病患者之結核菌。在二十倍石炭駿水中。歷三十秒鐘而死。在百倍石炭酸水中。歷一分鐘而死。在千倍昇汞水中。歷十分　而死。</p>

<h3>肺癆菌脱蠟殺滅法</h3>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌。而此菌一入入體內。則於該處。便成結節。以斷血行　路。又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質。包圍其體。以防禦一切外來　力之入。故雖用稳種殺菌碧。內服或注射。終不能選其病菌之實體內歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法。對症療法。理學的療法血淸療法。　　療法。及其他一切治療法等。尙未完全成功。而肺病無　之説。遍滿於一世者因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者。根據上述之學理。繼續研究。不遺餘力。結果竟成此殺　肺療菌之化學聖劑。名曰三那　Ｓａｎｏａｓｌｒ此　係遵肺療菌發明者德國考克博士與肺療菌脱蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發是成功者。據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告。此　有滲透肺病　之結節及溶解蠟質之作用兼具有殺菌力。能根治一二三期之肺癆。確肖　試萬　之特效。在中國。　經國民政府中央衛生試騐所化騐。　性和平無毒。絕無任何副作用。茲略舉醫治作用於下。(一)設於試驗　中。賽驗「三那星」之樂力作用。則一分鐘後。結核蘭皆消失其抗酸性。至三　　分　後則此肺結核蘭。完全殺　。無一倖免。</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗。則見「三那星」能　入結核病　。內設憸查其病　內灒伏之結核蘭則盡失其抗酸性。此足體明其蠟　之完全溶解矣。（三）如患者內服「三那星」一星期左右。則立見咯　稀釋。體熱下降等良好狀熊。（四）更　　內服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上。則顯見體直增加。食懲激　。一切症狀。遂漸和。終達終其　天再造之偉功。</p>

        <h1>1931.12.31</h1>
<h3>Jinzhou: Our Troops Begin Western Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Occupy Baiqibao and Dahushan, Jinzhou Increasingly Precarious. Fighting Reported in Hujiawobao and Bupu Yesterday Morning. Cannon Fire Heard in Goubangzi. The League of Nations Investigation Team's Candidates for British and American Members Still Difficult to Determine. Northeastern Army Stationed in Jinzhou</p>
<h3>Continuously Depart for Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>Vehicles on the Beining Railway Seized for Troop Transport. Many Officials and Important Personnel Also Entering Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 19th Brigade of the Northeastern Army, led by Sun Dequan, stationed in Dahushan, departed for Goubangzi on the 29th evening. The troops originally stationed in Goubangzi departed for Jinzhou on six trains on the 29th evening. The armored train headquarters moved from Goubangzi to Jinzhou on the 29th evening. The 13th Artillery Regiment departed from Jinzhou on five trains for Luanzhou on the 29th evening. The 12th Brigade, led by Zhang Tingchu, began its westward movement on the 29th evening. Many important personnel from various agencies in Jinzhou also entered Shanhaiguan. Jinzhou is unlikely to see further conflict. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It was learned tonight that Zhang Xueliang has ordered the troops in Jinzhou and its vicinity to withdraw into Shanhaiguan to prevent the Japanese authorities from using it as an excuse to expand their military operations in North China, given the large number of Japanese troops gathered in Tianjin. The troop withdrawal has already begun. It is said that the Liaoning Provincial Government will remain in Jinzhou, with only a small number of soldiers left for protection, while the main force will be completely withdrawn. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The withdrawal of Chinese troops from Jinzhou is proceeding rapidly. Last night, six trains loaded with soldiers and equipment departed from Jinzhou and entered Shanhaiguan. It is now learned that the first two trains passed through Shanhaiguan this morning and are heading towards Tianjin. There are approximately 500 to 800 Japanese soldiers in Shanhaiguan, who did not obstruct them. This morning, one Japanese patrol ship and three destroyers arrived at Qinhuangdao, presumably due to the withdrawal of Chinese troops. It is reported that these ships came from Lushun. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is now learned that Chinese troops from Jinzhou are currently entering Shanhaiguan on seven trains. The first train departed at 5:30 PM yesterday. The first and second trains have now passed Tangshan. Although their destination is currently unknown, it is said that all the troops will pass through Beiping. As far as is known, the troop withdrawal is proceeding without incident. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The situation in North China suddenly became tense this evening. Japanese troops in Shenyang have dispatched more troops to be stationed at Shanhaiguan Station. Chinese troops in Jinzhou are continuously withdrawing into Shanhaiguan and concentrating in Zhuozhou. The first troop train entered Shanhaiguan at 1:30 AM this morning. The second train, carrying 500 soldiers and 100 war horses, entered Shanhaiguan at 4:30 AM this morning. The third train, carrying 900 people, entered Shanhaiguan at 10:00 AM this morning. Japanese cavalry and machine gun units are stationed at Shanhaiguan Station, so the troop trains did not stop as they passed through. Residents outside Shanhaiguan and near Shanhaiguan are now moving into Shanhaiguan in droves. This morning at 6:00 AM, 2,000 refugees, protected by soldiers, entered Shanhaiguan and headed to Tianjin. Passenger and freight trains on the Beining Railway have all been suspended today. All vehicles between Tianjin and Jinzhou are being used to transport troops and military supplies into Shanhaiguan. All vehicles between Goubangzi and Shenyang are dedicated to transporting Japanese troops and Japanese military supplies. (30th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou dispatch: Today, passenger trains 105 and 107 heading east on the Beining Railway were seized at Yuguan and are being used to transport troops. The section between Jinzhou and Yuguan is congested with troop trains. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping: After the Japanese army occupied Panshan, they advanced towards Goubangzi at 7:00 AM on the 30th. At the same time, the Japanese navy dispatched warships and marines from Lushun to Shanhaiguan, attacking our army from both the front and rear. As a result, part of our troops stationed in Jinzhou moved backwards to defend against them. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign dispatch: Zhang Xueliang stated that Japan has violated the League of Nations resolutions and is gradually advancing towards Jinzhou. The only way to defend ourselves, apart from actual resistance, is to trust in international justice to prevent the situation from escalating and to strictly abide by the League of Nations' orders. Japan blatantly disregards this and is willing to undermine world peace. With military attachés from various countries as witnesses, we do not resist, and the responsibility for undermining peace rests solely with Japan. At the same time, we can still request the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact to extend their effectiveness in order to obtain a final judgment. Therefore, we have voluntarily withdrawn the Jinzhou troops to within the Great Wall to avoid conflict. At the same time, the situation on the Beining Railway line is already very chaotic, but as of the evening of the 30th, the government has not yet received Zhang's official report. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Goubangzi</p>
<h3>Falls into Chaotic State</h3>
<p>Our Troops Withdraw from Hujiawobao</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Goubangzi</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, Japanese planes dropped four bombs on Dahushan. Two to three hundred Japanese cavalrymen advanced to Dahushan. Our troops retreated to Goubangzi. Residents of Goubangzi are moving out. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, cannon fire could be heard very clearly in Goubangzi. The situation in Goubangzi is chaotic. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Beiping) The staff and service personnel of Xinmin Station have all fled. A Beining passenger train derailed at Xinmin yesterday. The telephone lines along the Xinmin route are being monitored by the Japanese, and their use is prohibited. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, Japanese planes dropped dozens of heavy bombs on Panshan Station, destroying eleven buildings at the station and one road maintenance house. The rest fell within the city, destroying the county government and many civilian houses, resulting in countless civilian casualties. There are no more Chinese troops on the Yingkou branch line. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, the Japanese army, under the command of Duomen, used two armored trains and three tanks to attack Hujiawobao, engaging in a night-long battle with our volunteer army and armored train unit. Our army was outmatched in firepower and withdrew from Hujiawobao at 5:00 AM on the 30th, concentrating in Goubangzi. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dispatch from Dahushan: There are no Chinese people or station staff at Xinmin Station. Train 106 has not departed from Huanggu Village, and the situation is unclear. Train 103 is not issuing waybills at Xinmin and is stopping at Liuhegou. Train 101 is stopping at Dahushan.

<p>(Tokyo) The vanguard of the Japanese army on the Yingkou railway line, advancing towards Goubangzi, has made considerable progress today. According to the latest news, a strong unit of Duomen's division, travelling from Panshan on an armored train, occupied and controlled a key location in Goubangzi at 5:00 PM today. It is expected to enter the town tomorrow. Also, a brigade commanded by Kamura, advancing west along the Beining Railway from Xinmintun, entered Dahushan at 2:30 PM today after fierce fighting. This location is only a few miles from Goubangzi. It is expected that these two units will converge tomorrow. Thus, the entire Yingkou-Goubangzi line will be occupied by the Japanese army, allowing them to advance towards Jinzhou. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Although the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Jinzhou has been confirmed, the Japanese army is still launching a large-scale offensive in southern Liaoning today. The Japanese navy has also received secret orders. According to news from Lushun, several Japanese destroyers anchored outside the port received secret orders today to immediately leave Lushun. Their destination is unknown, but it is believed to be between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao. Also, a cruiser, whose name is unknown, also departed from Lushun carrying a number of marines. All ships set sail at noon today. After fierce fighting, the Japanese army occupied Baiqibao at 11:00 AM this morning. A Japanese regiment departed from Shenyang for Xinmin, but was intercepted by a Chinese militia unit on an armored train. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting, and the Japanese soldiers, with the help of stationed troops, eventually defeated the militia. Baiqibao is now under Japanese control. Japanese planes scouting along the Beining Railway reported to Shenyang today that when the Chinese soldiers retreated from Baiqibao, many boarded armored trains, but many were left behind. These people are all fleeing south on foot. They also claimed that the Chinese army has built strong defensive fortifications at the Shenyang River and Dahushan, apparently intending to resist the Japanese army at these two locations. It is now expected that the Second Division, commanded by Duomen, will soon occupy Goubangzi. The Chinese armored train that retreated from Baiqibao is now advancing towards Goubangzi, with the Japanese army in close pursuit. (30th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) After the Japanese Second Division occupied Panshan yesterday, it advanced towards Goubangzi today. It is reported that its vanguard encountered a militia unit near Shuangtaizi. The militia bravely resisted, aided by our army's armored train, stubbornly defending their position and preventing the Japanese from crossing the river. However, due to the intense bombing by Japanese planes, followed by the charge of armored vehicles, they were unable to hold out for long and were forced to retreat. Also, a brigade under the command of Japanese General Kanya departed from here for Xinmin at 4:00 AM this morning. The departure order was issued last night. Kanya himself had already established a headquarters in Xinmin. According to recent telegrams from Xinmin, fighting has already broken out there. One regiment under Nakajima is advancing towards Baiqibao by car, followed by armored trains led by Yamagata. It is reported that there are 400 regular Chinese troops and 1,600 militia members in Baiqibao. The Chinese army has tanks, armored trains, infantry, and cavalry. The Japanese army is using armored trains, machine guns, cavalry, infantry, artillery, and superior air power.

<h3>Japan Deceives the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Expresses Intention to Advance into Western Liaoning</p>
<p>(Geneva) The document issued by Japan to the League of Nations Administrative Council on December 27th was sent out today, stating that Manchurian bandits are using Western Liaoning as a base, so the Japanese army will go directly to Western Liaoning. The document stated that the Japanese government has declared that maintaining peace in Manchuria is an extremely important matter, so it is devoting all its efforts to achieve this goal. However, bandit activities are increasing, because the Jinzhou authorities are encouraging bandits to disrupt the area. According to reports from the Japanese Army Command in Shenyang, from the beginning of November to December 12th, there were a total of 1,529 bandit cases. The Jinzhou army has not withdrawn into Shanhaiguan, as previously promised. The Japanese army must eliminate the bandit atmosphere in South Manchuria. To achieve this goal, it must advance to the west of the Liao River, as that is the bandits' base. In the past month, the Japanese army's actions to suppress bandits have been strictly limited. The Japanese government has exhausted its ability to avoid conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops. Japan hopes that its long-term patience and its intention to abide by international responsibilities will be recognized by world opinion. When this document was sent out, the Japanese Embassy in Paris also issued a document denying the claim that the Japanese army was systematically attacking Jinzhou, and stated that Japan's desire for Chinese troops to withdraw from Jinzhou was nothing more than to avoid conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops. The Japanese government has obtained evidence that the Jinzhou military authorities are helping the bandits. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations' Credibility Destroyed</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Advances Westward to Jinzhou</p>
<p>Resolution Clearly Ineffective</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations tonight frankly admitted that the League Council's resolution of December 10th has clearly proven ineffective, given the Japanese army's westward advance to Jinzhou. The purpose of the resolution was to prevent further hostile acts that could lead to the danger of war. But they still insist that, according to the League of Nations' past experience, resolutions that are generally considered unsuitable can ultimately prove to be most effective. It is now believed here that Zhang Xueliang is withdrawing his Jinzhou troops to avoid an open declaration of war between China and Japan. People in the League of Nations now hope that this action by the Japanese army will be the last one before the League of Nations investigation team arrives in Liaoning, because it is believed that after the investigation team arrives in Liaoning, the Japanese will not take any new military actions under their supervision.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>This Year</h3>
<p>The Economy This Year (Part 2)</p>
<p>(2) The Decline of National Industry and Commerce. Since the world economy entered its third phase, the exploitation of China has intensified, and the collapse of Chinese agriculture has accelerated. Chinese industry and commerce, like agriculture, have fallen into a tragic and desperate situation, barely able to survive.</p>
<p>Due to the stagnation of silk sales, domestic silk factories are struggling to survive and have generally ceased operations. In Shanghai alone, there are 29,000 silk looms, and each factory has about 10,000 piculs of cocoons mortgaged to financial institutions. Currently, only about twenty silk filatures such as Shen Chang Yu, Ying Feng, Xin Yuan Long and Xing Lun, are barely holding on, while approximately eighty have shut down, leaving over 50,000 men and women workers unemployed. In various cities and towns of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, no more than ten factories are operating. Wuxi has only ten to four factories. The situation is similar in Guangdong silk factories. The total number of unemployed workers is at least over 100,000. The vitality of the silk filature industry is almost completely extinguished. Due to the oppression of foreign capital, the Chinese textile industry, which fiercely competed with foreign factories last year, has also fundamentally faltered. For example, in 1930, China had a total of eighty-one textile factories, with 2,326,872 spindles. Within a year, Japanese companies increased their number of spindles by 130,000 and looms by 3,000. China also increased the number of spindles by 50,000 and looms by 250. Obviously, this competition has clearly failed. By the first half of this year, the Housheng Yarn Factory, with over 20,000 spindles, and the Sanxin Yarn Factory, with 70,000 spindles, were both acquired by foreign merchants. The decline of the textile industry is evident. Although it is said that since the Wan Incident, the intensification of the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods has dealt a major blow to Japanese textile factories, temporarily boosting the domestic textile industry, this is a special and temporary situation. Furthermore, with the sharp decline in gold prices and the easing of foreign exchange rates, foreign cotton is being dumped in China. Domestic cotton production has suffered due to crop failures. Manufacturers are uniformly importing cheap and high-quality American and Indian cotton. Therefore, although the domestic textile industry has shown signs of recovery on the surface in the second half of the year, in reality, its foundation is becoming increasingly weakened. In addition, the number of unemployed workers in Japanese textile factories has also sharply increased. Moreover, with the flour industry, the current national production volume, if operating at full capacity, is 250,000 bags per day, a 20% increase compared to the 200,000 bags produced three years ago. However, due to insufficient raw materials and limited sales, factories are only operating for five months, with half operations during the remaining seven months. The stagnation of the flour industry is already evident. Industries like match factories and cigarette factories have long been on the verge of collapse due to raw material shortages and foreign pressure. As for heavy industry, it is an undeniable fact that the coal mining and steel industries have long been manipulated by British and Japanese imperialism. Although the boycott of Japanese goods this year provided a great opportunity for the development of domestic heavy industry, China's heavy industry lacks a foundation. This has led to a coal panic. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce even convened a meeting in Beijing to discuss the coal shortage. The decline of China's heavy industry is already evident. Other industries such as shipping are largely controlled by foreign transportation enterprises, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has faced bankruptcy several times. Air transport, whether existing or planned routes, are mostly dominated by American capital. This is the situation of the decline of China's national industry over the past year.</p>
<p>As for commerce, China's foreign trade this year has resulted in an import surplus. Sales of major export items such as tea and silk have stagnated in recent years, making trade extremely weak. According to statistics for November, the total value of exports in October was 18,475,320 Haikwan taels, excluding the value of re-imported domestic goods of 13,603 Haikwan taels, the net export value was 18,461,717 Haikwan taels. On the other hand, the domestic market is almost entirely dominated by imperialist commodities. Although the intensification of the boycott of Japanese goods this year has reduced Japan's trade with China by a huge amount of 150 million in October, Britain has taken its place. In addition, with Britain suspending the gold standard and the fall in gold prices, its trade with China has sharply increased. According to the British Board of Trade, statistics show that the total value of exports to China from April to July 1931 was £1,735,000 and to Hong Kong was £687,000. In the quarter from July to October, exports to China increased to £1,766,000 and to Hong Kong to £1,331,000. Mr. Fox, the Commercial Counsellor of the former British Legation in Beiping, said in a speech at the Imperial Association that he was quite optimistic about commerce between the two countries, which shows his complacency. In short, (A) the accelerating collapse of the rural economy and the decline of national industry have made the lives of farmers extremely impoverished, increased the number of unemployed people in cities, and greatly reduced national purchasing power; (B) the expansion of areas disturbed by the Communist Party and bandits, as well as the large-scale destruction of transportation systems, have caused great obstacles to commodity circulation, and the market has shrunk dramatically. Strictly speaking, the area where domestic commodities can currently circulate is limited to the coastal and Yangtze and Pearl River basins, areas accessible by trains and ships, and a few large cities; (C) foreign merchants compete and exclude, and use China's unique lowest tariff rate in the world to implement annexation policies, and generally suspend the gold standard and reduce gold prices to lower commodity prices and exert high pressure on China's industry and commerce. Naturally, China's domestic market is completely occupied by "foreign goods." Therefore, in terms of the overseas market, China has no place to gain a foothold. In terms of the domestic market, it is also shrinking day by day. So, does China's commerce have any place at all?</p>
<p>(3) Urban Expansion. In recent years, especially this year, Chinese cities have experienced extreme expansion in terms of both finance and population. However, this expansion is a deformed and pathological phenomenon because it is not entirely due to the extraction of profits from commercial capital. The biggest reason is still the expulsion by bandits and the Communist Party. Because of the disturbances caused by bandits and the Communist Party, the propertied class, even those with modest means, have packed up everything and fled to safe cities, depositing all their money in banks. In recent years, especially after the major floods this year, the sharp increase in the population of various cities is very evident. The concentration of finance can also be seen in the following facts: (A) Although the domestic economy is declining, the banking industry is becoming increasingly developed. For example, this year, the Shanghai Youbang Bank issued Ping An dividend short-term savings, and the Silk Industry Bank and Enterprise Bank started operations. Ningbo Bank and Huamao Bank are in preparation. Various banks have established branches. The Central Bank has added a Beijing office. The Tianjin Savings Department of the Bank of Communications and the Tianjin Branch of the National Products Bank have opened. The Ji Agricultural and Commercial Bank convened a shareholders meeting to resume operations. The Shen Salt Industry Bank is preparing to open. The Xuzhou National Bank convened a shareholders meeting to increase capital. The Chongqing Bank of China added a warehouse. The Hebei Minsheng Bank is about to be established. Yongjia County in Wenzhou is preparing to establish a Farmers Bank. The Fujian Local Industry Bank resumed operations. Guizhou Province is preparing to restore the Guangxi Provincial Bank business. The Yu Chuan Kang Plantation Bank expanded its operations. The Heilongjiang Official Silver Company established an office in Changsha. The Tianjin Zhongyuan Commercial Savings Bank opened. The list goes on and on. (B) The amount of currency issued by various banks increased in August compared to July, and increased in September compared to August, consistently showing an upward trend. All this expansion of monetary capital and the development of the banking industry are counter-proofs of the expansion of urban finance. However, we should not overlook a peculiar phenomenon here, namely, the increasing expansion of capitalist relations (monetary relations), while capitalist production is declining tightly. The reason for this is that capital is fleeing to the hands of bankers in large cities. Bankers absorb huge amounts of cash and do not use it to develop industry and commerce or improve agriculture, but use it entirely for real estate speculation and gold public debt, and other buy-low sell-high transactions. Real estate prices in Shanghai have suddenly soared in recent years. Huge profits can be obtained between transfers. Various public offerings also fluctuate, with interest rates even exceeding 4%. Moreover, bankers not only do not use the expanded cash to develop industry and commerce, but instead use extremely high interest rates to annex China's dying national industries. For example, the silk factories mentioned above mortgage all their stored silk to bank consortia, and the so-called silk industry public debt and shipping industry public debt organize shipping banks, etc. are examples of this. Monetary capital dominates industry and increases the persecution of the fragile industry. It is becoming increasingly corrupt and declining, and will never be able to raise its head. Secondly, farmers struggling in the context of the bankruptcy of the rural economy, trying to desperately hold on to their land, do not hesitate to quench their thirst with poison, mortgaging their land or green seedlings and agricultural products, and accepting extremely high interest rates from banks, money shops, and bank agents. This fact also causes capital to flow back into rural areas. However, it does not in fact improve the agricultural economy, but rather creates a system of transportation pipelines. It intensifies the exploitation of the impoverished masses. It is absorbed into the city through this transportation pipeline. On the other hand, it is transported to the vaults of foreign financial capital through commodity imports, arms purchases, storage, and speculative activities. For example, the massive outflow of cash in China due to the outbreak of the September 18th Incident in the eastern provinces is proof of this. Therefore, the expansion of Chinese cities is a deformed phenomenon. It is another way in the process of the total collapse of China's national economy.</p>
<p>(4) Under such circumstances, the national finances naturally feel very tight, with a huge imbalance between income and expenditure. The finances of various provinces and cities are also on the verge of bankruptcy. The government has been very preoccupied with this phenomenon. After the end of the domestic war at the end of last year, the government attempted to revive the economy. There were various manifestations of this in fact. Construction slogans were raised again. The Fourth Plenary Session passed a plan to reform politics, as well as holding a National Economic Conference and a plan for a silver loan of 100 million, all of which indicated the government's desire and efforts to revive the economy. However, based on the new facts of this year, this hope and effort ended in a painful failure. Moreover, the dispute over silver loans has caused a split in the domestic situation.</p>
<p>The phenomena that have occurred in China's economic world over the past year are roughly as described above. In a nutshell, 1931 was a major calamity for the Chinese economy. Through this calamity, the Chinese economy is closer to bankruptcy. The Chinese masses are becoming increasingly impoverished, sinking deeper and deeper into the abyss of suffering from which they cannot extricate themselves.</p>
<p>With the current changes in the political situation and the imminent establishment of a new government, it is clear that another attempt to revive the Chinese economy will be rekindled. The closing statement of the Fourth Session of the First Plenary Session stated, "The conference believes that there are still urgent issues to be addressed: the gradual collapse of the social economy due to the decline in production, the increasing unemployment due to the collapse of the social economy, and the spread of red bandits due to the increase in unemployment. The conference believes that we should stabilize ourselves without undermining national rights and use foreign capital and skills to develop national production and realize the Premier's industrial plan." With a loud voice and firm words, utilizing foreign capital to restore the Chinese economy may be the direction in which the new government will strive. However, the fact on the other hand is that Mr. Lin Backer, the American who arranged the 100 million silver loan last year, will come to China again. The silver loan may be re-discussed. Mr. Haas, the Minister of Transportation of the League of Nations, will also go to Beijing from Shanghai, at the invitation of the Chinese government, with concrete plans for transportation construction. There are opinions on guiding the Huai River, controlling the Yellow River, and dredging the Yangtze River, ready for adoption by the government. Moreover, not long ago, according to newspaper reports, someone in Czechoslovakia was planning to unite twelve agricultural countries to form a large agricultural trust. On the one hand, China urgently needs foreign investment, while on the other hand, capitalist countries that have fallen into a situation of turmoil and collapse are also actively planning to develop China to alleviate the crisis of world capitalism. Dr. Rajchman, the Director of the Health Organization of the League of Nations, has come to China four times. He is a representative who specializes in studying Chinese financial affairs for European and American capitalists. Mr. Lamont, a representative of American capitalists, once said, "The United States hopes to implement large-scale loans for the fundamental consolidation of Chinese finances and industrial development." What should attract our attention the most is the slogan "Economic Revival from China" issued by the League of Nations. We should not ignore these fragmentary facts and intermittent statements. We must carefully analyze and truly understand them. While we certainly hope that the Chinese economy can be revived, we also cannot forget the plan implemented in Hungary by the international community. How will the curtain of China's economy in 1932 unfold? How will it turn around? Let everyone think and speculate.</p>

<h3>US Government's Recent Attitude Towards Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, key US government officials unofficially stated that the United States cannot recognize that the Sino-Japanese dispute in the three eastern provinces has been resolved until the Japanese army has completely withdrawn to the South Manchurian Railway zone. However, they believe that the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou will remove the excuse for the Japanese army to attack the Chinese army. Currently, senior US government officials, especially those in the State Department, are closely monitoring the latest news of the Sino-Japanese conflict in the three eastern provinces, but they do not want to make any formal comments on the overall situation in Manchuria. The Japanese government's response to the US warning has not yet been formally released, but it is heard that the US government believes that the Japanese reply is not completely satisfactory, and it cannot guarantee that there will be no conflict in Jinzhou even if the Chinese army does not withdraw. It is still unclear here whether the Japanese army's advance to western Liaoning is still engaged in suppressing bandits, or whether it has already clashed with the regular Chinese army.

Yang said that Feng County is still under the strict control of Zhang's troops. Dong Yujue, Zhu Dudian, and Huang Tirun are still under detention and have not been released. This incident was purely caused by the failure to demand supplies. The total loss of various agencies is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan, and the county seal was taken away to forge documents accusing Dong Yujue of being a reactionary.

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>After the Fall of Panshan, Many Northeastern Troops Retreating Within the Great Wall to Resist the Japanese Army are Militias and Volunteers</h3>
<h3>Japanese Troops on the Beining Railway Forcing Chinese to Undress for Searches</h3>
<p>Damei Evening News, Jinzhou, 29th: The Japanese army occupied Panshan today (29th) at noon. It is located only 19 miles south of Goubangzi. After the Chinese troops retreated north, they launched a counter-attack on the rear of the Japanese army, with fierce fighting continuing until this evening. According to reports, the Japanese army set out from Dawa yesterday and its vanguard had reached the outskirts of Panshan by 10:00 PM last night, immediately leading to fierce fighting which has continued through this morning. The number of casualties is unknown. A Chinese armored train, which Japanese headquarters had previously claimed to have destroyed, is now known to be intact. However, the railway from Panshan to Goubangzi has been bombed and is currently severed. Repair crews were dispatched this morning to repair the tracks, allowing the armored train to head north towards Goubangzi. At 8:00 PM tonight, this reporter (of the "Evening Blaze" newspaper) passed through Goubangzi on a train and witnessed the platform crowded with people desperately trying to board the already full train. The chaos was common. Panshan is only 19 li south of Goubangzi. People feared the Japanese army would arrive in Goubangzi as early as tomorrow morning. This is why they were fleeing. Today, several Japanese planes flew over Goubangzi and dropped several bombs, killing one soldier and wounding several civilians. Soldiers near the station fired rifles at the planes, but none hit. Currently, the small number of Japanese troops advancing are mostly composed of militia and volunteers. Regular troops with proper training are rapidly retreating west. It is reported that this afternoon, about 500 regular troops retreated from Dahu Mountain back to Jinzhou, with only a few escort teams remaining to resist the Japanese army. It is also reported that seven trains carrying troops from Jinzhou and nearby areas have already left for Lushan, located within the Great Wall.</p>
<p>Further Telegram: I, the reporter, departed Shenyang at 10:40 AM this morning, taking what appeared to be the last train before the Japanese army occupied the railway to Jinzhou. Upon reaching Juliuhe, we stopped for about an hour. The Japanese soldiers, like wolves and tigers, boarded the train and searched hundreds of Chinese passengers. At times, they even forced male and female passengers to undress completely in the harsh winter for a thorough search. Upon reaching Xinmin, the Japanese soldiers again boarded the train and searched as before. Several Japanese soldiers approached this reporter in the first-class carriage and questioned him closely, but did not search him. A Chinese passenger in the same compartment, who worked at the American Commerce Committee office in Shenyang, was searched despite carrying letters of identification from the American Commerce Committee and the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang. After the train passed Xinmin, it entered the so-called "non-garrisoned zone," where each station was defended by volunteers composed of local villagers. These men were in plain clothes and only wore badges with the words "Volunteer Army" to identify themselves. Whenever the train stopped, the villagers crowded around asking if the Japanese army was coming west. Along the way, one could practically not see a single Chinese soldier, until Dahu Mountain, where a small number of escort teams were present. The train that this reporter was riding was often stopped to allow westbound troop trains to pass first. While stopped at Xinmin, a Japanese plane flew over the train and dropped a bomb in an open field about half a mile from the railway before returning to Shenyang. According to staff at Jinzhou station, at 2:00 PM this afternoon, the Japanese army cut off the telegraph and telephone lines at Liuhegou near Xinmin. Shortly after, the first troop train heading towards Jinzhou arrived at Xinmin.</p>
<h3>Zang Shiyi's Traitorous Words: Uniting the Four Northeastern Provinces into an Independent Nation, Hoping Japan Establishes a Manchurian Governor-General</h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, the Japanese-owned Dalian Manchurian Daily published a plan for the establishment of a new regime in Fengtian, stating: When Zang Shiyi formally took office as the Governor of Fengtian Province today, he announced the future policies regarding the political issues of the Northeast to the representatives. He said that he intends to unite the four northeastern provinces, announce a system of inter-provincial autonomy, and form an independent nation. However, for the sake of governing the new northeastern nation, a president will be elected by the four provinces. At the same time, the provincial governments will have exclusive control over administrative, judicial, and financial powers. Transportation and military affairs will be discussed at length because of special circumstances. However, huge military expenditures should be reduced. In order to ensure equal opportunity, a land of happiness for all ethnic groups should be established without prejudice. At present, Japan will establish a Manchurian Governor-General's Office. I (Zang Shiyi) hope for its realization, because after the Governor-General's Office is established, it can assist in maintaining the security and traffic safety of the new northeastern nation. At the same time, negotiations with the Governor-General's Office can be resolved satisfactorily. However, in addition to the provincial government, an advisory council should be established, hiring Japanese as advisors and serving as the highest advisors to the new government.</p>
<h3>Robbery on the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway: Passengers' Belongings Looted, Several Injured, and More Than a Dozen Missing</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Xuzhou: The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is a remote and desolate area, often subject to train robberies by bandits. Yesterday (28th), a ticket train from Haizhou to Xuzhou encountered a tragic robbery west of the Daxujia Station. The train departed from Xinpu in the west. When passing through Bayiji at about 8:00 PM, more than a dozen bandits disguised as passengers, carrying box cannons, went unnoticed. At about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, after the train passed Daxujia Station, a short distance from the station, dozens of bandits suddenly emerged from the roadside and opened fire on the train. At this time, the bandits hiding on the train had already moved to the front of the train and colluded with the bandits ambushing on the road. At the sound of gunfire, they immediately drew their guns and forced the driver to stop the train. The bandits on the ground then rushed into the train, first into the second-class carriage, looting belongings. Some passengers jumped off the train to escape, and were shot down by the bandits. The passengers' belongings were all looted. The bandits shouted, "Don't be afraid, everyone. The end of the year is approaching, and we need to celebrate the New Year, so we're taking some money to use." It was found that a certain merchant was carrying approximately three to four thousand dollars to be remitted, which was also looted. The bandits then turned to the rear guard car. There were six railway police officers escorting the train, including one named Cao Zizhen, who was guarding the door. He was shot in the abdomen by a bandit and died instantly. The bandits seized two rifles and rushed into the car. At that time, the train captain Zhou Shiqi, ticket inspector Jin Su, and collection clerk Lu Zhaobing were all in the car. The bandits immediately asked where the collection clerk was. They searched Lu and took the key, looting approximately two thousand dollars in road funds collected on the eastern section. At that time, Hu, the deputy division commander of the First Cavalry Division, was traveling from the Grand Canal to Xuzhou, accompanied by two orderlies, each carrying a box cannon. He tried to resist, but one of the orderlies was wounded in the cheek, and both box cannons were seized. After looting extensively, the bandits dismounted and shouted for the driver to drive the train. They then fled into the roadside. The train did not arrive in Xuzhou until late at night. It was found that approximately a dozen passengers were missing. When the train departed, there were still wounded passengers lying on the roadside, unable to be questioned. The number of people abducted by the bandits is also unknown. Feng Wenda, the second section chief of the Longhai Railway Police in Xuzhou, will go to investigate today (29th). Also, the tracks were not damaged at the time, so traffic was not disrupted. Dongping is still operating today, but the railway has increased security by six people to prevent further danger.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Takes Office in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Nanchang: The newly appointed Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Xiong Shihui, along with Commissioners Yuan Liang, Li Dezhao, Wu Jiantao, and members of the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee Li Zhongxiang, Wang Guanying Liu, and Jiashu, arrived in Jiangxi by boat from Nanjing on the 24th. They arrived in Xun at 10:00 PM on the 25th and, after resting briefly, took a special train prepared by the Nanxun Railway to the province that night. At 6:00 AM on the 26th, the special train arrived at Niuhang Station. Among those who came to welcome them at the station were Pacification Director Zhu Shaoliang, Acting Provincial Governor Xiong Yuxi, Construction Director Gong Xuesui, and several hundred representatives from all walks of life. After Xiong and the others got off the train, they crossed the river with the welcoming party and entered the city, resting briefly at a large hotel before going to the provincial government to take over. Acting Chairman Xiong Yuxi and Secretary-General Zhou Jie handed over the seals and documents to Xiong and the newly appointed Secretary-General Liu Tigan for receipt. After Xiong took over the provincial government, he went to the provincial party headquarters to take over. Later, in the reception hall of the provincial party headquarters, he met with reporters and announced his administrative policy: 1. To clean up officialdom and build a clean government. Those found to be corrupt will be severely punished. 2. Finances will be completely transparent, and the people's burden will never be increased. 3. In terms of personnel, talent will be the sole criterion, and no private appointments will be made. He will also be fully responsible for suppressing bandits and other issues in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangxi as soon as possible. On the same day, Wu Jiantao took over the Department of Finance, Li Dezhao and Yuan Liang took over the Department of Civil Affairs on behalf of Xiong. Director of Education Chen Jianshu is still at Wuhan University, and Wen Qun and Xiong Sui have not yet arrived in the province. Xiong has sent telegrams to urge them to come. It is said that the various provincial committees have scheduled a supplementary oath ceremony for the 28th.</p>
<h3>Jingjiao Stone Carvings Moved to Pingxi for Display</h3>
<p>Two Jingjiao stone carvings and one Liao Yuan stone tablet remained at the Shizisi (Cross Temple) of Sanpen Mountain, located in Wanping County, Pingxi. Various families have recorded them in their records. The Miao Yifeng Hall has a rubbing of them. In the autumn of this year, German and Japanese scholars visited and promoted them in the news. The History Museum affiliated to the Academia Sinica believes that these stone carvings are of great importance to the communication of Chinese and Western culture. Furthermore, after investigating that the temple has now been sold to private individuals and is located in the mountains, where there are frequent bandit alerts, it is necessary to move and preserve them. With the consent of the Hebei Provincial Government, the two counties of Wanping and Fangshan were instructed to assist in sending personnel to move and transport them. In addition, stone Buddhas, stone plaques, and other items were unearthed. These items have now been transported to the exhibition hall of the museum at the Meridian Gate in Beiping.</p>
<h3>Review of the Cabinet Changes (2) The Lineup of the Inukai Cabinet</h3>
<p>After Inukai Tsuyoshi received the order to form a cabinet, he immediately began to do so. The next day (13th), the new cabinet member list was announced as follows:</p>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi (Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs)</p>
<p>Kenji Yoshizawa (Foreign Minister before assuming position, by the Prime Minister)</p>
<p>Korekiyo Takahashi (Minister of Finance)</p>
<p>Mineo Ōsumi (Minister of the Navy)</p>
<p>Sadao Araki (Minister of the Army)</p>
<p>Tokugoro Nakahashi (Minister of Home Affairs)</p>
<p>Kisaburo Suzuki (Minister of Justice)</p>
<p>Ichiro Hatoyama (Minister of Education)</p>
<p>Toyosuke Hata (Minister of Colonial Affairs)</p>
<p>Teijiro Yamamoto (Minister of Agriculture and Forestry)</p>
<p>Yonezo Maeda (Minister of Commerce and Industry)</p>
<p>Takejiro Tokonami (Minister of Railways)</p>
<p>Chūzō Mitsuchi (Minister of Communications)</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 13th, Inukai and the eleven cabinet members successively met the Emperor at the Phoenix Hall in the palace and held an inauguration ceremony. It should be noted here that the Secretary-General of Seiyukai, Kuhara Fusanosuke, did not enter the cabinet. Ever since Kuhara concluded an agreement with the Minseito advisor Tomita Kojiro, his position has been completely different from that of Inukai. On the day Inukai received his orders, Kuhara still earnestly advanced the idea of a coalition cabinet. However, Inukai ultimately rejected him. In addition to feeling resentful, Kuhara had no choice but to refuse to join the cabinet. On Inukai's side, in order to fully express his own theory of a single-party cabinet, he could not invite Kuhara into the cabinet and undermine his own views. However, Kuhara's rejection is a clear sign of the current split in the Seiyukai.</p>
<h3>The Reinstatement of Gold Export Ban</h3>
<p>Among the members of the new Inukai cabinet, the most noteworthy is that of Korekiyo Takahashi as the Minister of Finance. In the past decade, Takahashi has served as Minister of Finance three times. He is considered to be a skilled and experienced veteran of Japan's national financial administration. Upon assuming his new position, he immediately implemented the Seiyukai's policy and decisively carried out the "reinstatement of the gold export ban," immediately restoring the situation from September 12, Taisho 6 (1917) to January 11, Showa 5 (1930). Whether the reinstatement of the gold export ban can restore Japan's economy is a big question. At present, it can only be said that it will help the zaibatsu earn tens of millions of dollars in undue profits. At the same time, it will raise prices and inflict suffering on the common people.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Single-Party Cabinet</h3>
<p>Wakatsuki Reijiro resigned because he rejected the coalition cabinet issue. Inukai Tsuyoshi succeeded him and formed a cabinet according to his theory of single-party government. At this point, the coalition faction has no chance to extend its influence. However, it is necessary to observe the actions of Adachi Kenzo, Tomita Kojiro, Kuhara Fusanosuke and others after the establishment of the Inukai cabinet. After Adachi and others advocated a coalition cabinet, a deep rift clearly developed between them and Wakatsuki Reijiro, Inoue Junnosuke and others. Therefore, before and after the resignation of the Wakatsuki cabinet, voices advocating for the expulsion of Adachi and others occupied a considerable position within the Minseito. However, for fear of causing the party itself to shake, it was never put into practice. At 1:00 AM on the 12th, Adachi, Tomita, Nakano, Yamaji and others met at Adachi's residence to exchange some views on the expulsion issue. As a result, Adachi, Tomita, and Nakano decided to voluntarily leave the party first, and Yamaji voluntarily resigned from the position of secretary-general. Adachi and Tomita have a prominent historical position within the Minseito. Their decisive departure will pose a major threat to the Minseito and plunge it into great turmoil. As for the Seiyukai, Kuhara Fusanosuke, the coalition faction, voluntarily resigned from his position as secretary-general after being rejected by Inukai. His successor has been replaced by Yamaguchi Giichi. The changes are likely to affect the future of the Seiyukai. At present, we can only conclude that the departure of Adachi and Tomita and the resignation of Kuhara will give the political parties some shock. However, in the years to come, there may be a new political movement.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the Inukai single-party cabinet is not tolerated by the coalition faction. The military is also fiercely opposed to it. The idea is that "the current situation is the most difficult since the Russo-Japanese War. The Minseito cabinet, which has an absolute majority in the House of Representatives in the past, has exposed its incompetence. Now, replacing it with a Seiyukai cabinet may not be able to open this difficult situation. Therefore, at this time, it is necessary to create a strong and powerful cabinet supported by the people in substance, rather than in form. In other words, we expect the emergence of a cabinet that does not rely on political parties but is formed through the cooperation of all parties. "Someone from a certain position is saying something. We cannot confirm that the military's opinion is in line with that of Adachi and others, but they are equally dissatisfied with the theory of single-party government.</p>
<h3>The Seiyukai's Monopoly of Official Positions</h3>
<p>The second noteworthy thing after Inukai formed his cabinet is the intensification of the hunt for official positions. From the permanent vice-ministers to local officials and colonial officials, all are being replaced blindly. In particular, the changes in local officials are sufficient to serve as a shameful illustration of Seiyukai politics. To put it simply, this time the changes in local officials are entirely due to the internal strife between the Suzuki faction and the Tokonami faction within the Seiyukai. The Minister of Home Affairs, Nakahashi Tokugoro, is inherently incompetent. He is nothing more than a puppet of the Suzuki, Hatoyama, and Mori factions. Suzuki, in order to expand his own powerful forces, has been trying to appoint his own people as local officials. As a result, the Tokonami, Mizuno, Mochizuki, and Akita factions have risen up to compete with the Suzuki faction. There is not enough to go around, which has led to the overall change of local officials. The visits of the Tokonami faction and Mizuno on the 17th to appeal to Hatoyama and others are merely the outward expression of this spoils system. "Reinstating the gold export ban" and "replacing officials" can be said to be the two major weapons used by the Inukai cabinet at the opening. Although it is still difficult to predict the outcome, if a tree wants to flourish, it must first strengthen its roots. We can wait and see.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<h3>Dispute at Chongming Bridge Town Elementary School</h3>
<p>The issue of the principal of Chongyi Bridge Town Elementary School has been marked by accusations and counter-accusations, leading to repeated disputes. Former Education Bureau Director Tao even proposed suspending operations to quell the strife. However, since Chen Canhang took over as principal, the school has made considerable progress over the past year. Unexpectedly, Tu Guangding and others have filed complaints against Chen again. Education Bureau Director Liu, wanting to place a former teacher connected to him, commissioned Section Chief Feng to investigate, intentionally extorting them. On the 27th of this month, female teachers from the school went to the bureau to state the facts, but Director Liu and Section Chief Feng were rude and insulted the women, even pushing two of them to the ground. Thereupon, Principal Chen complained to the county magistrate about the illegal conduct of the director and section chief, and planned to seek assistance from all sectors of the county.</p>
<h3>Continued Recovery of Stolen Goods in the Qi Surname Burglary Case in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Following the arrest of Zhang Amai in Jiangzhuang for the major burglary case involving the Qi family in this city by patrol officer Fei Gongxia of the water patrol team, and the recovery of gold chains and gold earrings, it has now been learned that gold bars (erroneously transcribed as "Eergeng"), a pearl the size of a soybean, over two hundred small pearls, gold ear picks, and other items worth nearly ten thousand yuan have been recovered from Zhang Amai's pig shed. The stolen goods have been taken back to the inspection department for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Suspect in the Sipo Lane Robbery Case in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Qian Songyao's home at No. 28 Sipo Lane was robbed the other day, with losses exceeding 7,000 yuan. Yesterday (29th), the investigation team arrested a suspect named Qiao Xiaoliuzi, a native of Yancheng and former dock worker in Shanghai, at the railway station. He has been taken to the investigation team for questioning.</p>
<h3>Court Record of the Case of Anzhen Bureau Official Accepting Bribes to Replace Smoking Suspect</h3>
<p>Shen Jizhou, chief of the 16th sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau in Anzhen, 8th District of the County, arrived on the 5th of this month to take office. At that time, he hurriedly came to Wuxi without bringing his luggage, so on the 9th, he went to Jiading to retrieve it, and entrusted bureau official Huang Bingjian to ask for three days of leave on his behalf. When he arrived at the bureau on the 15th, Huang Bingjian reported that on the 11th of this month, police officers Zhao Changchun and Wang Jinshan had arrested a black pill offender named Cai Jujuan, and the black pills were in a box. The offender had been released on bail, etc. Considering that the case involved the judiciary, Chief Shen ordered the bureau official to summon Cai for questioning. Cai confessed to carrying the black pills without denying it. After investigation by Chief Shen, it was found that the Cai Jujuan who was presented was not the real person. After the incident, he spent 60 yuan, and bureau official Huang made a decision on his own to release Cai on bail. When Chief Shen thoroughly investigated, he bought a rogue named Mi Tiansheng from this town and used his name to appear in court, hoping to muddle through. However, he was seen through by the county court, which led to the public security bureau chief being involved, and Huang bureau official avoided the situation by going into hiding. Chief Shen was also implicated for no reason. Yesterday (30th), the county court held a court hearing. Bureau Chief Shen Jizhou, patrol chief Yin Hongsheng, and police officers Zhao Changchun, Wang Jinshan, Sun Yucheng, and An Ruohua, a total of six people, arrived. At 4:00 PM, prosecutor Du heard the interrogation in court. As a result, Shen Jizhou and the other five were ordered to return, and An Ruohua was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Strives for Business Tax on Cotton</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Changshu County Chamber of Commerce's Business Tax Collection Committee stating that Guang LE and other yarn factories had set up cotton collection points in Yu, and had not paid the business tax due for this year. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce checked Article 2 of the Ministry of Finance's Provisional Measures for the Collection of Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn, which stipulates that in accordance with the Regulations on Unified Tax on Cotton, all cotton yarn manufactured domestically and imported from abroad that has been subject to unified tax shall not be subject to other taxes and levies within the areas where the unified tax is implemented. Furthermore, Article 1 of the Business Tax Law stipulates that businesses operating in various provinces and municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, with the exception of factories paying factory tax to the central government or banks organized as limited liability companies paying income tax, shall be subject to business tax. Therefore, each factory pays unified tax in accordance with the Regulations on Unified Tax on Cotton, which should by definition include everything, and no other taxes should be levied. Furthermore, according to Article 1 of the Business Tax Law, factories paying factory tax to the central government are exempt from business tax. Yesterday, in addition to replying to the Changshu County Chamber of Commerce's Business Tax Collection Committee, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing requesting that it instruct the Department of Finance to inform its subordinate business tax collection agencies that they should not levy business tax on the cotton collection points of each yarn factory that has already been subject to unified tax, in order to comply with laws and avoid double taxation. At the same time, the County Chamber of Commerce also sent separate letters to the County Government and the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce for notification.</p>

Magistrate Ma convened a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and other parties on the 28th to borrow from the money, sand, and coal industries for a period of one month.</p>

<h3>Case of Filial Impiety: Exhuming Bones for Examination</h3>
<p>A farmer named Zhu Deshi, (59 years old), living in Daqiao Town, Dongxiang, of this county, had a wife named Jia and a son named Shunshi, who married a daughter-in-law named Pan. The family was ordinary. Zhu's son did not engage in proper work, and his father repeatedly admonished him without listening, resulting in frequent arguments between father and son. On the night of the 14th of the ninth lunar month of this year, father and son had another quarrel. The next morning, Zhu Deshi's body was suddenly found in a nearby river. Zhu Jia and others salvaged it and prepared a coffin. Wang Zhushi, the niece of the deceased, and Wang Weicai, the nephew, learned of the incident and rushed over, finding out that their uncle had been murdered by Shunshi and others and placed in the river. The town also spread the word that "the son murdered his father." Wang Zhushi reported the information to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to arrest the son. However, Zhu Jia and Zhu Shunbao had already fled, and only his daughter-in-law Zhu Pan was detained and taken into custody by the prosecutor's office of the court. The plaintiffs, Wang Zhushi and her son, were also summoned to the case. After several interrogations, Zhu Pan insisted that she did not admit to the murder. In addition to issuing an arrest warrant for the wife and son of the deceased for questioning, prosecutor Ju Sancai went to open the coffin for examination the other day. Due to the corpse being rotten, it was impossible to examine it, so the coffin was brought to the city. This morning (29th), the bones were exhumed for examination. However, due to the dim weather today, the examination could not be carried out and will be continued tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Homicide in the Fan Family Case in Huzhou: Perpetrator Sentenced to Death</h3>

After a public trial on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, Wu Changming was sentenced to death for the crime of murder.</p>
<h3>Wuhu, Anhui Province: After the Disaster, Exemption from Grain Taxes is Proposed</h3>
<p>Anhui Province suffered an extremely severe flood this year, and the death rate is increasing daily. The autumn harvests in various counties have been set, mostly based on the principle of collecting taxes from cultivated land after removing barren land. However, the cultivated land is insufficient to compensate for the disaster, and the majority are unable to pay the grain taxes. The counties of Dangtu and others had previously petitioned the provincial government, requesting exemption from this year's grain taxes as a means of relief for the disaster victims, but this was not approved. Currently, Zhang Gongheng, the Anhui Province Disaster Relief Commissioner, telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the First Plenary Session, and the Shanghai National Disaster Relief Committee, requesting exemption from Anhui Province's grain taxes for this year. It is unknown whether this will be approved.</p>

<h3>Xiaofeng: Arrest of Xiaofeng Chamber of Commerce Committee Members</h3>
<p>Lin Shize, a standing committee member of the Xiaofeng County Party Department, dispatched his nephew Zhu Hongfu and fellow villager Wang Jun on the 19th of last month, leading police to Tailong and Xinchang stores in Baofu Town. They claimed that unverified scrap cloth was Japanese goods and fined each store 500 yuan. While the two stores were protesting, Lin Shize dispatched Zhu and Wang to the stores to extort money, demanding 500 yuan. Onlookers were indignant. Wang and others ordered the police to beat Jiang Fengqi, a clerk at Tailong, causing him serious injuries, and fired a gun in the store, piercing through the ceiling and roof tiles. The clerks at Jin Town were terrified and asked the county government for protection. Clerks from various stores in the city rose to provide assistance, but to no avail. On the 21st of this month, they had no choice but to leave their stores, causing all city commerce to grind to a halt. While the Chamber of Commerce was convening an emergency meeting to persuade the clerks to resume their businesses, Lin Shize colluded with County Magistrate Fei Peng, leading police to illegally arrest six people, including Cheng Huairen, Zhou Qi, Cheng Shi, and Zhou Jianan, all standing committee members and store owners of the County Chamber of Commerce, falsely accusing them of being reactionary and escorting them to the province late at night.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Many International Gatherings in the First Two Months of Spring</h3>
<p>League of Nations Continues to Consider Sino-Japanese Liaoning Case</p>
<p>The Future of the Geneva Disarmament Conference is Not Optimistic</p>
<p>US Government Unwilling to Participate in Reparations Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - Cabinet members, government officials, and diplomats from various countries will be very busy in the next two months, as several important conferences will be held. According to today's news, the reparations conference is scheduled to be held in Lausanne on January 20 next year. Important discussions on this matter are currently underway in Paris, London, and Washington. The League of Nations Administrative Council will meet at the end of January in Geneva. Its agenda will include important matters, such as the Sino-Japanese dispute over Manchuria, which it should continue to consider. The Disarmament Conference is scheduled to open on February 2. The Japanese delegation is already on its way. Former British Foreign Secretary Henderson will chair the Disarmament Conference if his health recovers. It is expected that the meeting place for the reparations conference is now set for Lausanne because it is close to Geneva.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th - US Undersecretary of the Treasury Mills stated today that the United States has not been invited to participate in the Hague reparations conference, not even an informal invitation. Even if invited, the United States would not want to participate, so there will be no trip to Europe this winter. This statement is quite unexpected, as it was previously expected that the United States would join.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 29th - Hoover stated that former State Department official Davis has been appointed as one of the US representatives to the Disarmament Conference. The chief representative is US Ambassador to Britain Dawes.</p>
<p>National News, Tokyo, 30th - Japan recognizes that the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva this spring has little chance of achieving anything other than laying the foundation for future negotiations. The secret instructions carried by the Japanese delegation to the conference were initially formulated by the Minseito Wakatsuki Cabinet. Since the Seiyukai came to power, the Inukai Cabinet has revised them. The content cannot be disclosed, but it is self-evident. The Seiyukai cabinet's policies towards China and northern Asia are more rigid than those of the Minseito. It is expected that the revised instructions will solemnly reaffirm Japan's position and strive to ensure that its military strength is sufficient to cope with possible future threats. As for Japan's so-called threats, they often refer to Soviet Russia. In short, the attitude of the Japanese representatives can be summarized in one sentence: they will always adopt a wait-and-see policy, leaving everything to the initiative of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and only express Japanese opinions when necessary. Regarding the navy, Japan will adhere to its position in the London Naval Conference, with a ratio of 7 to 10 with the British and American navies. The Japanese navy is already fully powerful in the Far East and can be fearless of other countries, but Japan will strive to maintain its existing strength and have the right to expand when Soviet Russia is sufficient to threaten it. As for the army, Japan's future position will largely depend on the attitude of Soviet Russia, as Japan clearly recognizes Soviet Russia as its future enemy, and most officers feel that a future contest of strength between Japan and Russia is ultimately inevitable. Japan claims that the Russian army currently has 70 divisions and that a large army is stationed in Siberia, close to Manchuria and Mongolia, which the Japanese consider their first line of defense. Therefore, the Japanese cannot reduce their armaments.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Telegraphed to Indian Governor General All-India Labor Unions Schedule General Strike</h3>
<p>Situation in Northwest India Still Not Peaceful</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Red Shirts Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 29th - Gandhi's first step into the political arena was to send a telegram to Indian Governor General Wellington. This telegram, issued today, asks whether the laws recently promulgated in the United Provinces, the Northwest Frontier Province, and Bengal are a sign of a complete breakdown in relations between the government and the All-India Congress, or whether he should seek the Governor General's advice on future actions. Please reply by telegram. This telegram is the result of deliberations by the All-India Congress Working Committee. Some committee members were perfunctory and unhelpful, but Gandhi, for the sake of caution, advised the working committee to delay its decision until he knew the government's true attitude.</p>
<p>Reuters, North Xia, 30th - There have been recent disturbances by Red Shirts in the Northwest Frontier Province. Although the situation is now slightly calmer, 32 more Red Shirts were arrested in North Xia City today. The total number of people arrested in this province has now reached 1,128, of whom 259 have been convicted and 37 have been released. The British troops stationed here were withdrawn to their original defense positions yesterday because the locality was gradually calming down, but today, because a crowd gathered and volunteered to go to the police station to be arrested, the authorities brought the British troops back. However, as soon as the crowd heard that the troops had arrived, they dispersed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 30th - The executive committee of the Labor Union Congress has set February 4 next year as a day of general strike. The purpose of this move is to show the government the strength of Indian labor organizations. The Congress belongs to the left wing of the Indian labor movement.</p>
<h3>With Foreign Troubles Pressing, Women's Basketball Players Vent Their Anger: Liangjiang Recovers Victory over Red Team</h3>
<p>33 to 25</p>
<p>Hopes for Championship Greatly Increased</p>
<p>Mai Ling Suffers Another Defeat, Hope Declared Lost</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team defeated their strong rival, the West China YMCA Red Team, last night by a score of 33 to 25. The Liangjiang team's hopes for the West China YMCA Women's Basketball Championship also rose greatly amidst the shouts and cheers of 600 supporters in the West China YMCA basketball gymnasium. The Mai Ling team, with a difference of two points, lost to the West China YMCA First Team again by a score of 22 to 24. Hopes for the championship have dwindled.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Achieves Great Victory Over the Red Team</h3>
<p>The course of Liangjiang's victory over the Red Team is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>West China YMCA Gymnasium is Packed</h3>
<p>The West China YMCA basketball gymnasium was declared full last night. Even standing was not allowed later. Liangjiang's victory was perhaps due to the cheering and waving of flags by these 600 people. In the midst of pressing foreign troubles, they vented their anger a little. When the outcome was uncertain, the atmosphere was extremely tense.</p>
<h3>Xi Jun Shines Throughout the Field</h3>
<p>Liangjiang's victory can be said to be due to Xi Jun's efforts alone. After a long period of disappointment, she finally recovered her original form last night and showed her past prowess. She made every shot under the basket, with unparalleled skill. It was no easy task to score 21 points alone. Shao Jingying's three long shots were also praised.</p>
<h3>Red Team's Shooting Lacked Accuracy</h3>
<p>The Red Team's performance was also astonishing. Their forward showed great dynamism, with Jie Hansheng being the most outstanding. Liangjiang's defenders often found themselves unable to attend to everything. However, the lack of accuracy and confidence in shooting was the real cause of the defeat. They lost many opportunities. The defenders also defended very strictly. Therefore, it was a match between worthy opponents and was truly one of the most exciting of the season.</p>
<h3>Red Team Takes the Lead in the First Half</h3>
<p>Referee Shu Hongshao blew the whistle to start the game. After three minutes of scrambling, Xi Jun's tap under the basket opened the scoring. Shao Jingying made a long shot, taking the lead 4-0. Jie Hansheng made a long shot, making it 4-2. In the first quarter, Liangjiang won 10-6. The Red Team's Jie Hansheng ran and jumped, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and actually tied the score at 10-10, and then surpassed Liangjiang 12-10 two minutes into halftime.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang's Victory in the End</h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, Xi Jun made three consecutive shots under the basket, scoring three times in a row and regaining the lead 16-12. From then on, Liangjiang was ahead by three or four points each time. The score in the third quarter was 19-15. The outcome was still uncertain. The Red Team was still trying its best to counterattack, and for a time, the tension was very high. Then, the West China YMCA Red Team happened to bring Li Defo out, and Liangjiang took the opportunity to attack, winning a big victory of 33-25.</p>
<h3>It All Depends on Next Week's Finals</h3>
<p>Now, the Liangjiang Red Team and the Rowing Team have each lost once, while the Mai Ling team has lost twice. Next week, Liangjiang will meet the Rowing Team, and the Red Team will meet the Mai Ling Team. If both Liangjiang and the Red Team win, then the two teams will play another final. If Liangjiang and the Rowing Team win, then Liangjiang will win the championship. Therefore, everyone hopes that the Mai Ling Team will beat the Red Team, and Liangjiang will beat the Rowing Team.</p>

<h3>Reminiscences of Dailiang</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>Looking back, in the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the Navy had Qiu Shijing, who left his name in history, and the Army had Zuo Shi, who died heroically in battle. These were the only such figures in the two hundred years of Qing Dynasty. The veteran of the Huai Army, Hong Shangcheng (also known as Gong, formerly the Governor-General of Zhili), fought bravely. He was unfortunately suppressed by Ye Zhichao at the Battle of Pyongyang, preventing him from realizing his ambitions. During the Boxer Rebellion, he was attacked by both the Allied Forces and the Boxers, ran out of ammunition, and had no reinforcements, and died in battle. He still maintained his heroic character. What is recorded here is Zhang Gaoyuan, a "madman" of the Huai Army, under the command of Song Zhu San (Song, the Governor of Sichuan). He was stationed around Fenghuangcheng with 1,500 men. Their firearms were of poor quality and ammunition was insufficient. What they relied on was the skill of their subordinates. They always engaged in close combat. Zhang always led his soldiers and was invincible. The Japanese regarded him as a tiger and specially assembled a large force to surround Fenghuangcheng. Zhang led more than ten men, including his adjutant, into the Japanese camp at night, killing countless enemies. Zhang's method of defending against the enemy was to always expose his chest, wielding his knife and charging out. Despite the hail of bullets, he never flinched. Yet, after fighting dozens of battles, he was never hit by a bullet. People regarded him as a lucky general. The title of "madman" was given to him by the enemy. This is recorded to show that there were also talented generals at that time, but unfortunately they were not given the opportunity to use their talents. Not including Tingzhou Qi Dahui</p>

<h3>Driving Away National Calamity Text</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>On this, the Lunar New Year's Eve of the twentieth year of the Republic, I reverently take up my three-inch writing brush as a vanguard, and declare to the national calamity: The northeast borders are not sufficient to restrain the enemy's military force, allowing them to ravage at will. The northeastern military strength is not insufficient to fight the enemy and launch a large-scale punitive expedition, yet they are forced into this situation, entering our heartland. This has led to the cunning Japanese invaders to contemplate further actions, shaking my Liaoning and Shenyang, seizing my Beida, and encroaching on my Tianjin. The three islands stand proudly, seemingly competing with China. Since the opening of hostilities until now, more than a hundred days have passed. It is indeed due to the incomplete unification of our country, and the lack of resources to defend the borders. There is no denying it. Now, the new government of our unified nation has been established. Those involved in politics and governing at this time, should feel fear and apprehension, men of virtue and ambition, sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, hoping to wipe out the great shame of the nation. It will be seen that the authority of those in command will inevitably be relied upon, and the rules of punitive expeditions will certainly be based on something. Then, holding whips and reins to maneuver, and bearing flags and banners to assist, I know the little neighbor to the east, caught off guard, will flee in panic. Alas. Like Mi Xu being enfeoffed for reclaiming lost territory, like Hengyang holding sacrificial rites before a campaign, with the spirit to request a military expedition, therefore, hearing the sound of drums, one immediately thinks of the magnificence of the campaign. I will offer this to say: The water of the Eastern Ocean is vast and mighty. That land is the country of Penglai. Why are the dwarfish Japanese pirates so rampant? Devouring us bit by bit like silkworms, swallowing us whole like whales, we are truly wounded. Therefore, declare the orders for punitive expeditions, banish them to distant lands. Order the generals beyond the borders to transmit the proclamation, do not hesitate or waver. Let the smoke of gunpowder cease and the poisonous fog disperse, may the cannon fire be hidden. Hoping for the restoration of diplomatic relations, cultivate amity in treaties. Respect the League of Nations and be allied, protect each other like lips and teeth. Truly, it is the island nation's fortune, to be forgotten by us forever. Celebrate the peace of East Asia, leaving a glimmer of hope for the future.</p>
<h3>Angry Writing</h3>
<p>— Wei Wenxi</p>
<p>Frustrated and indignant, I slam the chess pieces. Turning my head, I am startled by the loss of flags on the three borders. The mountains of Song and Xing are empty of the bones of war. The autumn wind carries a tight, somber sound through You and Yan. Within the army, there is still a will to sacrifice oneself. It is difficult to bow in surrender under the city walls. I only fear that the beans are being fried too hastily. The kindness and resentment of those before and after are not clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>Who will strike the northern gate with the key of the town? Many mouths complain about the prince's neglect of autumn defense. When the nation is weak and slaughtered, there is no complete plan. The sword bears the guilt of lying across the whetstone. Together, our souls are broken by the rivers and mountains. It is in vain to boast that the tongue on the altar still exists. Heroes are not judged by success or failure. A shattered jade is ultimately not comparable to a tile.</p>
<p>What good is yielding and discussing war? Missing the opportune moment leads to regret. It is difficult to find a Liu Duhou of Longyou. I am saddened by the Ma Fubo of Hutou. It is impossible to block the sky with a single tree. It is pitiful to wait for rescue in the three rivers. The Tang Dynasty's enfeoffment of Boli is an empty tale. I gaze at the distant borders with many tears.</p>
<p>The autumn wind is bleak, rolling up dust from the borders. The rivers and mountains outside the pass are frequently lost. It is because the Great Wall has no Daoji. It is strange that there is a Toyotomi who recommends food. The people of the nation are indignant and want to drive them out into the market. The enemy's horses have already inquired about the ford. I write out all the sorrowful faces; when will it be broken? I ask and sing of going beyond the borders with a mix of sadness and bitterness.</p>
<h3>Goat Milk and Bees</h3>
<p>— One</p>
<p>Gandhi's goat milk Gandhi, who attended the British Indian Round Table Conference, needed goat milk as a daily drink. This time, at the British Dairy Products Appraisal Meeting held in London, he won first prize. It is said that the prize was a green ribbon. This ribbon was tied around the goat's neck, and it was officially called Gandhi's name. According to the staff of the Appraisal Meeting,</p>
<p>A Mr. De said to the examiners, "Since Gandhi came to London, goats, which were previously not given much attention, have now</p>
<p>. The value is rising day by day. Because the people in the society who admire Gandhi are all emulating Gandhi to eat goat milk."</p>
<p>Bees on the plane A plane flying from Marseille to Paris. A few days ago, a passenger was carrying a box of bees. Due to the vibration of the machine, the lid of the bee box suddenly came off. The bees in the box scattered in the driver's room and the passenger room. The faces and hands of the driver and passengers were stung by the bees, as if ants were biting flies. Fortunately, the driver was wearing a pair of goggles to protect against sand. Regardless of the passengers' shouts, and without trying to swat the bees, the bees did not harm the driver. Therefore, he was able to fly safely to Paris. However, the faces of several passengers had been injured by the swarm of bees.</p>
<h3>Autumn Butterfly's Dream in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>— Yang Jifu</p>
<p>Ms. Butterfly and Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhang Juchuan, and Pan Yihua recently came to Qingdao at the invitation of the Shandong Grand Theater to hold an opening ceremony. It happened that the Social Bureau was preparing a winter relief entertainment fair and asked them to participate in the performance. This was a charitable act that could not be refused. Zhengqiu then revised and added details to the old script of "Saying Dreams," completing it in one night. This play was originally a one-person show, but now Lu Lian'er, Li Darong, Luo Yiweng, and Luo Congxin have been added, and Huang Laoda has been renamed Lu Laolao, making a total of five people. There are more twists and turns. Butterfly plays Yun'er. Zhengqiu first plays Darong, then Lu Laolao. Two other gentlemen joined temporarily, playing Yiweng and Congxin. The play depicts Lian'er as a poor girl who is deceived by the wealthy official Li Darong, who recognizes her as his adopted daughter and takes her to the north to live in a certain prince's mansion. One day, eight years later, Darong and his old friend Luo Yiweng secretly meet in the garden and threaten and lure her, wanting to force her to be his concubine. Lian'er firmly refuses. While they are arguing, Darong hears Yiweng's voice and has to go inside to talk. Yiweng's son, Congxin, is also in the garden. Hearing Lian'er crying, he inquires about her background and circumstances, but does not realize that Darong is forcing the girl to be his concubine. He then advises the woman to seek education and asks Darong to provide financial assistance. At this time, since no names are mentioned, not only does Lian'er not know that the person Congxin is asking for is Darong, but Darong also does not know that the girl seeking education is the concubine in his mind. As a result, the three realize their mistakes when they meet face to face. Darong is furious and is about to resort to violence when Yiweng comes out of the room, learns the whole story, and breaks off relations with Darong. After Darong leaves, Old Man Lu suddenly appears, with eyebrows as white as snow, singing loudly as he passes by. Yiweng asks why he is singing loudly. He replies that if he does not sing, he will surely fall into a dream, and the dream is terrible. Because he does not want to fall into a dream, he sings to correct it. He also explains in detail that he dreams that the western neighbor frequently comes to bully and that the eastern neighbor's invasion is even worse. Holding a blade and painfully cutting, he actually cut off twenty-one branches, and then strangled my throat, determined to kill me. Therefore, I think that if I continue to sleep and not wake up, I will surely suffer a poisonous hand. I specially advise my compatriots to wake up. Having said that, he sings two songs, sharply criticizing the current ills, telling people not to be selfish and self-serving, fighting for power and position. After singing, Lian'er rushes forward and cries bitterly, saying, "Are you not my father? I have been thinking of my father for a long time. Meeting flesh and blood, I cannot restrain my grief." She plans to sue Darong in court and is willing to donate all the fines to help the relief effort. She also asks Yiweng to donate his savings to help the poor. The curtain then falls. Excellent, excellent. Zhengqiu's intention is to use the "Saying Dreams" section to awaken his compatriots, making them shudder. Finally, he returns to the theme of helping the relief effort, which is extremely appropriate. Butterfly, in her hesitation and difficulty, expresses the helpless expression of a weak woman, perfectly portraying her identity. Her crying and narration of her miserable family history, intermittent and stuttering, word by word, with pauses and momentum, wins the sympathy of the whole audience. She can be said to be good at expressing herself. I have asked Zhengqiu to perform the old script of "Saying Dreams" three or four times. After three years of separation, I did not expect to see the revised and improved performance in Qingdao, which made me even more pleased. Zhengqiu is getting stronger as he gets older, and his contributions to the world are becoming more and more sincere. Zhengqiu and his group have now arrived in Shanghai, so I wrote "Autumn Butterfly's Dream in Jiaodong" to celebrate it. (Moved to help the Chinese and foreign charity relief effort)</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes at Year's End</h3>
<p>— Zhu Kuan</p>
<p>The national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and there is no way to dispel my sorrow. In the past, I was troubled, so I accompanied Ms. Pan Zhenhua and Xie Yaohua to the Carlton to watch a movie. After watching the movie and leaving the theater, it was already past seven o'clock. The weather was gloomy and cold that day, so we went to Nanyuan on Fuzhou Road for a little drink. The dishes were plentiful, and we talked and laughed happily. However, none of the three of us were good at drinking. We sipped a little plum wine and could not handle it. After the meal, we were tipsy and wanted to leave. As we passed through the corridor on the upper floor, Ms. Xie accidentally saw a couplet on the wall and smiled and drew our attention to it. The couplet said, "A little drink invites good guests, a tipsy face intoxicates Sixth Master." Alas, what a coincidence it is. It turns out that I am sixth among my brothers. I recently married Ms. Pan. The good guest, Ms. Xie, is talented and versatile, the youngest daughter of Xie Gong Siting, the younger sister of brothers Shengzu and Zhonghe, a graduate of the McTyeire School, and a student of Western music. She is proficient in piano. A beautiful maiden, and diligent in her studies, she is well-versed in both Chinese and Western literature. She is good at playing the flute and can sing Kunqu opera. A clear song has the effect of lingering for three days. She can also write running script and large seal characters. She studies traditional Chinese painting with the old painting master Feng Chaoran. She is good at landscapes, figures, and flowers. Recently, she hired a teacher at home and devoted herself to the study of poetry and lyrics. I once saw her paintings at Ms. Pan's place. The brushwork is pure, elegant, and unconventional. The inscription in running script is also round and smooth, completely different from ordinary strokes. I heard that she is rushing to make four-panel screens to add to Ms. Pan's dowry. A rare talent in the boudoir. Could it be that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth must also choose the person to bestow upon? To call her a good guest is truly not an overstatement. (To help the Chinese and foreign charity relief society)</p>
<h3>Supplementary Notes on Qiu Shuyuan</h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Zheng Yimei's "Qiu Shuyuan at the Time of the Cession of Taiwan" in "Free Talk." There are many errors and omissions. Based on my relationship with Mr. Qiu, I have written this article to correct Zheng's article and supplement what Mr. Zheng did not cover.</p>
<p>Qiu Shuyuan, also known as Xiaohongsheng, was a former Qing Dynasty scholar. He was friendly with Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, and they frequently exchanged poems. After the revolution, his millions of dollars of family wealth were all gone. After entering the Republic, he lived in Singapore for a long time, calling himself a "Singaporean resident." The name "Singapore" (the common name for Singapore) was named by Shuyuan. He co-founded the Chinese Girls' School with Dr. Lin Wenqing, and he personally graded the papers. The existence of this English girls' school for Chinese in Singapore should be attributed to Mr. Qiu. From the Republic to the tenth year of the Republic, he served as a special writer for the Hong Kong Chinese Daily News to make a living. The twilight years of a hero were so sad. From the tenth to the fifteenth year of the Republic, he founded a poetry society in Singapore with the monk Zhuandao and others. Mr. Qiu's living expenses were sometimes subsidized by old friends and temples. His poverty is evident. In addition to the poems mentioned by Mr. Zheng, he also has a collection of Xiaohongsheng's poems. There are also prose pieces such as "Wiping Away Sweat." From the seventeenth to the eighteenth year of the Republic, he always stayed at home writing poems and prose, which were published in various newspapers in Nanyang. In the eighteenth year of the Republic, the Singapore Daily News was published, and Mr. Qiu was hired as the editor of its supplement, "Fanxing." At the end of that year, I returned to China from the Malay Federation. Passing through Singapore, I visited Mr. Qiu. He showed me the family treasures he had collected throughout his life and gave me a small seal in the style of the Afang Palace tiles, inscribed "Qiu Zichang Sheng," because I am also a member of the Qiu clan. In the nineteenth year of the Republic, he co-founded the Nanyang Calligraphy and Painting Society with Ouyang Xuefeng and others. In the Nanyang Calligraphy and Painting Monthly published in these two years, there were also Mr. Qiu's articles.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu has two daughters. The eldest daughter, Mingquan, is a poet and painter. She married Mr. Wang Shengzhi. Wang is a student in the Department of Political Economy at Peking University and has talent and fame. He can be called Mr. Qiu's good son-in-law. Mr. Qiu has no son. From the perspective of our country's concept of inheritance, it is inevitable that there is regret.</p>
<p>Liang Shaowen called Mr. Qiu "the only reformer in Nanyang twenty years ago" in his "Nanyang Travel Notes" published by the Zhonghua Bookstore. This is indeed not an exaggeration. Because Zheng's article has the phrase "suddenly died of illness," Mr. Qiu is actually still alive today. However, his life is quite poor.</p>
<p>News from the publishing industry A number of giants in the publishing industry have organized a weekly publishing house, planning to circulate seven types of weekly newspapers with different characteristics. At the beginning of its establishment, it was decided to first publish a social weekly newspaper, which is currently being prepared. The correspondence address is No. 1580 Guangrenli, Aiwengyi Road. Anyone who wishes to serve as a special writer or has other plans for weekly newspapers can contact them by letter.</p>
<h3>An Independent Jiangbei Man (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaoruo</p>
<p>Mourning Shen Zhuowu</p>
<p>This time, the Dade was burned again after the Daji. Our spirits are of course very uncomfortable. People therefore blame the company. We are extremely willing to take the blame ourselves. If they expect us to make serious improvements in the future to ensure the safety of passengers, we will sincerely accept it. I would like to reiterate that Guangming Chun is our position. We want people to know that we absolutely do not want the huge losses to the branch's assets or the personnel disputes and pain to happen. And how could people have foreseen the immeasurable disaster that came down from the sky? Moreover, most of the areas where Chinese shipping should be reformed and strive to catch up are the same. We certainly cannot shirk our responsibility for this, but people should also have a sense of fairness.</p>
<p>Now some people want the Ministry of Communications to immediately stop the business of Dajin Company. This is going too far and exceeding the limits. Try to think about transportation businesses, such as railroads, ships, and airplanes, which one can guarantee that it will never have an accident? If something unfortunate happens, the entire company will be shut down. I'm afraid the Ministry of Communications can't set this precedent. There isn't a single country in the world that has such a law.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have closed my doors and concentrated on compiling my father's books. I don't know which way the wind is blowing. I have tasted the ice and frost of the world, the songs and tears of life, and I have a deep understanding of them. I really want to end the past events and return to an unusual plainness. I don't know why my temperament has suddenly become solitary. I never want to be with many people, especially I don't want to see acquaintances. Although people may not think that I am different from a few years ago, I am always nervous and sensitive. It's like I'm looking for trouble. So I have been in Shanghai for many years. Since then, I have never had the opportunity to see Zhuowu. But Zhuowu was always very concerned. He often asked people to send greetings and came to my house two or three times, but I was not at home and did not meet him. If I had known this would happen, I would have made sure to see him a few more times.</p>
<p>Zhuowu also has an elderly mother in her high years and a widow and weak children who need to be raised and educated. The years are long. It is of course our responsibility as those who live on after him. I am willing to gather Zhuowu's friends, Yu Yuhu, Sun Zhesheng, and Zheng Zhaojue to discuss ways to benefit the deceased. I also want to raise a sum of money to make a memorial for Zhuowu. How can it be appropriate and permanent? I will wait to discuss with friends from all walks of life before making a decision. Of course, I am the most saddened and uneasy among Zhuowu's friends. It has been almost ten days since the accident. Zhuo's whereabouts are still unknown. There is no hope of survival. The body cannot be found. What a quick and clean death! The rolling Yangtze River is connected to the vast sea. It is where Zhuowu is buried. But we always hope that Zhuowu can come back. At least his heroic spirit will come back, come back! (December 19, 20th year of the Republic, Hong Kong)</p>

<h3>Public Bond Prices Rebound by Half</h3>
<p>Spot Prices Show Mixed Fluctuations with Large Swings</p>
<p>February Futures Still Not Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday (30th), in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the bond market saw active spot trading, but the future market appeared calm. Only January futures were traded, with February futures still not showing any activity. Market conditions were less lively than before. Due to mixed signals from the domestic and international scenes, with few significant developments in internal affairs and diplomacy, investor sentiment suddenly shifted to wait-and-see, resulting in fewer transactions from all parties. Supply and demand were subdued, and the trend appeared to be stabilizing, with minimal fluctuations in each transaction. Futures trading started sluggishly in the morning, showing more contraction compared to the previous day. Later, due to relatively good demand from small retail investors, there was a slight rebound. As a result, except for a small gain of eight cents for customs bonds, other bonds rebounded by about half a yuan. Spot prices generally declined due to the excessive gains of the previous day. However, the 1921 customs bonds, which have been inactive for a long time, surged by as much as 7.5 yuan. On the other hand, the seven-year long-term bonds continued to fall by 4 yuan compared to early October. The bond market is expected to become even more sluggish during the day, with no significant gains or losses expected. The total spot trading volume for the day was 39,000 yuan, while futures trading amounted to 1.88 million yuan in the morning session and approximately 1.3 million yuan in the afternoon session, totaling only 3.175 million yuan. After deducting over 900,000 yuan for consolidated taxes, the remaining amount was only 2.2 to 2.3 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Weak Demand for Spot Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Sichuan Yarn Prices Stable, Inventory Full. Demand for Sichuan yarn is showing signs of saturation. Therefore, there was no price movement today, and market sentiment was weak. Moreover, the impending all-out attack order in Jinzhou has further dampened investor confidence. Tight credit conditions have made it difficult to sell spot yarn. Spot sales totaled 400 bales, with 275 bales coming from Guangdong, including 25 bales from Yi Jin, 25 from Zhenjiang, 10 from Shantou, and 20 from Jiangxi. Inter-dealer transactions totaled 50 bales, with market conditions remaining flat.</p>
<p>Guangdong sent 100 bales of Yao cotton. Spot cotton trading remains weak, with no news of arrivals. Both supply and demand sides are showing signs of reluctance.</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 31.4060. Guangdong sent 100 bales, spot delivery at the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Extremely Low Yarn Delivery Volume This Month</h3>
<p>Only Fuguang delivers 300 bales in actual delivery</p>
<p>The futures market for December was quite unstable at the beginning of the month. The lowest price once reached 147.4 taels due to the difficult national situation and the increasing disturbance by violent Japanese elements in northern Cambodia, which led to increasingly serious financial stringency and sluggish business. Therefore, most short-term traders tended to sell short, but one major player, seeing the lack of underlying goods, took a strong buying position and refused to release the pressure. There was even talk of a squeeze, and the market rose to 157 taels. Before long, the Japanese military openly prepared for war against us and issued a general attack order in Jinzhou, causing the market price to fall back to the 50 tael mark, but most of the buying pressure remained strong and did not loosen. In short, due to the deteriorating situation and tight credit conditions, fewer people were taking delivery. The last transaction fell by two taels and was priced at 148.7 taels. The resulting price was 150 taels, and the delivery volume was 5,050 bales, but only 10 bales of Fuguang were actually delivered, while the rest were settled privately. The brokerage numbers and quantities of both delivery and receipt parties are listed below.</p>

<h3>Cotton Delivery Details This Month</h3>
<p>Delivery Price: 31 Taels</p>
<p>Only 8,000 to 9,000 dan of Fire Machine Cotton</p>
<p>The December cotton futures market saw a price decline at the beginning of the month, mainly due to the softening of overseas Indian and American cotton markets. Spot sales were particularly sluggish, and domestic factories were already saturated with foreign cotton, completely encroaching on the domestic cotton trade. Market sentiment was weak, and the price hovered around 31 taels. Later, due to the unfavorable situation and tight credit conditions, some spot traders sold short, driving the price down to a low of 30 taels and 3.5 cents. However, the Ningbo merchants were determined to buy 5,000 to 6,000 dan of Yao cotton for delivery in their home region, which stimulated the market. The final transaction suddenly surged to 31 taels and 5 cents, resulting in a delivery price of 31 taels for the remaining 18,600 dan. Among them, only 8,000 to 9,000 dan were actually delivered, all of which were Fire Machine Cotton, while the rest were settled privately. It is estimated that the Ningbo merchants received 6,000 dan, and Da Ji received 2,000 dan. The names and quantities of the delivering cotton merchants and short-selling traders are listed below.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Prices Strengthen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were firm and active due to purchases by Japanese merchants and strong performance on Wall Street. Futures prices were up 12 to 16 points, while spot prices rose 15 points. English cotton futures rose 2 points, while spot prices fell 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton prices rose due to shortages of Omra cotton, with Pingor up 2.75 rupees, Omra up 8.5 rupees, and Broli up 1.75 rupees. Original telegraph (29th dispatch).</p>

<h3>River Lower Rice Market Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from Shanghai South. Transactions were sluggish, and the price remained at the original level. Few goods arrived, and the supply from Ningzhou was also thin. The path for ocean rice was limited, showing signs of weakness. The Yuanfeng rice stores saw excellent trading, with prices rising by 10 to 20 cents. Due to the unfavorable price of ocean rice, people were holding steady. The estimated amount of rice from the lower reaches of the river was 1,000 shi.</p>
<p>Although the amount of rice from the Xinzha area was small, there were many small transactions, and the overall price decline was limited. The top price of Xixin remained the same as the previous day, while the middle price rose slightly. Early and late rice remained stable. Transactions for Du Pu Jian were few and far between. Passenger rice was sold as soon as it arrived, with a slight price increase of a few cents, changing by two yuan. The demand from workshops remained strong, and rice prices rose by a few cents. Forty to fifty ships arrived from the west.</p>
<h3>Spot Ocean Rice and Customer Demand Weaken Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's ocean rice market situation turned stagnant again due to the suspension of operations by the Hankou traders. The only transaction in the general market was 200 bags of Xiaojiao rice from this street, priced at 9.9 yuan. Although the quality of the goods was slightly lower, it was already 5 to 6 cents lower than the previous market price. Rice trading firms continued to sell futures, and there were also 300 to 400 tons of returned goods. New transactions included 1,000 tons of February Xiaojiao rice sold by Jiesheng at a price of 4.4 taels, and 700 tons of February Xiaojiao rice sold by Weili at a price of 4.3 taels. Yuanxing sold 100 tons of Malay rice at a price of 4.95 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Prices Rebound, with Consistent Gains Across All Types</h3>
<p>Continued Sales of Dutch Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the production area that the spot price of Cuban sugar was 1.125.</p>
<p>This was a recovery of two and twelve-and-a-half points compared to the previous telegram. The New York sugar futures price for March of the next year was 1.1, up two points; May was 1.17, and September was 1.28, both up one point each. The spot and futures prices of Javanese sugar remained unchanged. The official market prices were particularly firm, but due to the upcoming closure for the holiday, trading was quiet. The price of No. 24 coarse granulated white Dutch sugar rose by 9.6 taels, and the price of fine granulated white Dutch sugar rose by 9.7 taels. Supply at the port was also scarce, and the trend was particularly bullish. The import and export of Taikoo sugar were also sluggish. B Mark was priced at 11.725 taels, HX at 11.55 taels, and HM Mark at 11.4 taels. The market situation was also very firm. There were new sales of Dutch sugar, with the sale of 100 tons of No. 8 red Dutch sugar for shipment in February and March at a price of 4.85 Dutch guilders. Foreign firms opened the price for coarse granulated white sugar at 5.1125 yuan, and it was reported that 200 tons had already been sold, subject to confirmation by telegram.</p>

<h3>Overseas White Filature Arrival Prices Remain Low</h3>
<p>B Grade Prices Fall Below 800 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai local foreign silk market remained sluggish. Although there were telegrams from overseas regarding white filature, the arrival prices remained low. New York B Grade was 81.2 points, and Lyon 13-15 denier was priced.</p>
<p>Prices for all grades fell below 800 taels. Factories had to bear losses of 200 to 300 taels per bale, and there were few sales. Yesterday, only Lianna and others imported 20 bales of yellow filature, and Dachang and others imported 10 bales of white raw silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Dried Cocoons Sell Out, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Factory Imports Subdued, Cocoon Costs Must Be Net 800 Taels</p>
<p>The sale of white filature has been sluggish for a long time. Silk factories have fallen into despair, and eight out of ten silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have suspended operations. The supply of dried cocoon raw materials is increasingly scarce, and factory imports are subdued. However, the asking prices of the remaining merchants remain firm. Yesterday, a silk factory in Zhabei replenished its autumn cocoon shortage and completed a transaction of 35 dan. The cocoon costs still had to be net 800 taels, plus labor costs, etc., bringing the cost of each bale of silk to over 1,000 taels. The factory suddenly made a painful purchase.</p>
<h3>New Shipments of Broadcloth and Woolen Fabrics Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday's broadcloth and woolen fabric market remained weak. Apart from some retail transactions in this street, there were very few large-volume shipments from other regions. New goods for the next year from foreign firms, such as - Zhitong, Floral Cloth, Huate Cloth, Chocolate Ding, and Two-Ply Cloth, are arriving in Shanghai daily.</p>
<p>Each warehouse in Pudong and Puxi has a considerable amount of inventory.</p>
<h3>Coal: Jiawang Coal Arrives and Prices Are Released</h3>
<p>Over 3,000 tons of Jiawang coal, transported by Dongfang Shipping, were unloaded yesterday. In the afternoon, market prices were released, with lump coal priced at 10.5 taels and coal fines at 8.5 taels.</p>
<h3>Non-ferrous Metals: Zinc Resumes Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Zinc prices rebounded yesterday, selling for 14 taels, slightly exceeding previous levels. Although the increase was not significant, it was a positive sign for the struggling non-ferrous metals market. The buyers were mainly from Henan, and the local arsenal also made significant purchases yesterday. The total daily transaction volume reached 600 to 700 dan. The price of domestic zinc was also stimulated by the rebound in foreign zinc prices, and it rose by a few cents.</p>
<p>It was selling for 13.5 taels, but the trading volume was not very high.</p>
<h3>Galvanized Iron Sheets in Short Supply</h3>
<p>The number of galvanized iron sheets that have arrived is not large, so the standard asking price is higher than that of plain iron. Currently, No. 24 sheets are selling for 11.25 taels per dan, No. 26 for 12 taels, and No. 28 for 13 taels. The most popular sheets on the market are No. 28 and No. 26.</p>
<p>Transactions for No. 24 are less active because they are not used by government agencies.</p>
<h3>Low Inventory of New Lead Wire</h3>
<p>Although the recent trading volume of new lead wire has not been very strong, the supply is limited, and the inventory is already low. Therefore, the standard price remains relatively firm. Currently, each dan is selling for 12.75 taels, and colored wire is selling for 18.5 taels. It is estimated that 700 to 800 dan were traded yesterday, which further reduced the amount of available spot goods. If trading activity increases in the future, the standard price is likely to rise again.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Meets with Wang Jingwei to Discuss National Crisis</p>
<p>Plans to Visit Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong if Necessary</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday at 5:00 PM and immediately went to the Nar Hospital on Avenue Joffre to visit Wang Jingwei, inquire about his illness, and discuss the national crisis. Feng also stated that he planned to visit Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong if necessary and mentioned the possibility of visiting Chiang Kai-shek in Feng, although this was not yet fully decided. Feng is staying at Hu's old residence at 301 Avenue Messimy in Shanghai. The duration of his stay in Shanghai is yet to be determined. Those who accompanied Feng to Shanghai yesterday included Zhang Zhijiang, Xue Dubi, Tang Yueliang, Huang Shaogu, Gao Xinya, and more than ten attendants.</p>
<h3>Grand Welcome</h3>
<p>Upon learning of Feng's arrival in Shanghai, various local organizations and the Songhu Garrison Commander Dai Ji immediately dispatched a company of soldiers from the 78th Division, while the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a platoon from the No. 1 Company of the Police Corps, a platoon of patrol police from the 5th District, a platoon of road police, and a platoon of military police to stand guard at the station. The public concession and the French concession police also sent many Chinese and foreign detectives to the station to provide security. Those who went to the station to welcome him included Central Committee members Zhang Qun, Li Liejun, Chu Minyi, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Luyin, former subordinates of Feng such as Liu Yufen, Li Xingzhong, Deng Zhexi, Zhao Zhengping, and volunteer troops and Boy Scouts. The number of ordinary people who gathered upon hearing the news was no less than 10,000. The station was crowded with people both inside and outside. The grand welcome was unprecedented. The Municipal Public Security Bureau even sent a military band to play music at the station to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Demeanor</h3>
<p>This is Feng Yuxiang's first</p>
<p>time in Shanghai, but his demeanor is the same as it was in the past. Feng was still wearing a dark gray cotton-padded jacket and pants made of coarse cloth, dark blue cotton-padded shoes, and a dark gray homespun cloak in his left hand. Some people mistook it for a cotton quilt. Mr. Feng is a large man with a distinguished appearance, standing head and shoulders above the crowd. His palms are very large, and although his eyes are not piercingly bright, they are quite sharp. At first glance, one can tell that he is a thoughtful and accomplished person. As the train pulled into the station, the crowd surged and the music played loudly. When Feng got off the train, he was immediately surrounded by the welcoming crowd, making it difficult to move. He smiled and thanked them, raised his right hand as if giving a military salute, and repeatedly shouted, "Excuse me, excuse me," "Everyone please</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday</h3>
<p>excuse me." The military police then tried their best to separate the welcoming crowd, and Feng was finally able to walk out of the station with difficulty in the crowd and board a brand new car numbered 333 to Hu's residence on Avenue Messimy.</p>
<h3>Feng's Statement</h3>
<p>After getting off the train at the North Station,</p>
<p>Feng stated the purpose of his trip to reporters, saying: "The purpose of my coming south this time is solely to unite all comrades and jointly resist the violent Japanese. Therefore, I hope that all leaders can come together to take responsibility for saving the country. Therefore, I am very concerned about the illnesses of Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu. The reason I rushed to Shanghai is solely for the sake of Mr. Wang's illness. If he can recover soon, I will advise him to quickly go to Beijing. As for Mr. Hu, I have the same hope. Therefore, if necessary, I will also make plans to go to Hong Kong. As for Mr. Chiang, I also hope that he will fulfill his responsibilities and abilities and jointly face the national crisis. At this time of national crisis, I think everyone's patriotism will not be inferior to anyone else. Therefore, I have no personal desires in coming to Beijing and Shanghai this time. I only have one simple purpose: to shift everyone's attention from internal matters to external affairs. I consider all other issues to be secondary. As for my personal living conditions, coming to the prosperous world of Shanghai may seem strange to some, but in fact, I see the bankruptcy of China's economy and cannot bear to enjoy myself excessively. I have no intention of being different for the sake of being different. I hope that my compatriots will not be too extravagant, but I also do not force others to agree with me. If the Chinese revolution succeeds, productivity increases, and everyone can have a prosperous income, then it will not be too late to raise the standard of living."</p>
<h3>Feng and Wang's Secret Talks</h3>
<p>After Feng arrived at Hu's residence, this</p>
<p>newspaper reporter asked to take a photo as a souvenir. Feng readily agreed. When taking the photo, Feng joked, "I am now taking orders from others." After resting for a while, Feng accompanied Chu Minyi in a car to Nar Hospital at 1526 Avenue Joffre to visit Wang Jingwei and discuss the national crisis. Mr. Wang and Mr. Feng held secret talks in the sickroom for about an hour. After they separated, Mr. Wang and Mr. Feng talked left and right. Feng was extremely concerned about Wang's illness and also elaborated on many important plans for the party and the country. Wang leaned against the pillows on the bed, listening silently to Feng's words, and was very moved. Even though it exceeded the time allotted for conversation by the doctor, he still refused to rest. However, Wang could not say much due to his high fever and liver pain, and only expressed to Feng that he deeply wished to recover from his illness as soon as possible and go to Beijing to discuss everything together. Mr. Feng arrived at the hospital at 6:00 PM and left at 6:45 PM.</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Resigns from Two Positions</h3>
<p>President of the Judicial Yuan and Acting</p>
<p>Chairman of the Special Diplomatic Committee</p>
<p>Before entering Beijing, Wu Chaoshu had stated that he would return to Guangdong after the closing of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee and the formation of the new government, as Chen Jitang and others had repeatedly urged him to return to Guangdong to preside over provincial affairs. Therefore, Wu submitted a request to the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee yesterday to resign from his positions as President of the Judicial Yuan and Acting Chairman of the Special Diplomatic Committee. The original text of his resignation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Resignation Letter from President of the Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>Presented to request that the position of President of the Judicial Yuan cannot be undertaken, please select another capable person. On the 28th of this month, I was selected by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee to be the President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government. Upon hearing the order, I should have taken office, worked hard for the party and the country, and lived up to the appointment. However, according to the revised Organic Law of the National Government, the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government. I have been away from the country for four years, and I am not familiar with the newly established laws and regulations. If I am responsible for the trial, it will be difficult to be competent. Instead of working hard and becoming overwhelmed, it is better to carefully consider myself and resign in advance. This is the first reason why I cannot undertake the position due to my knowledge and ability. I have also served in the central government for many years, and I deeply feel that to transform China, the central government should work hard, and the local government should not be neglected. If the local government is properly organized, the central government will be able to make arrangements more easily. For example, the most urgent task now is how to eliminate bandits, how to cultivate civil rights, and how to develop construction. All of these depend on the efforts of the local government. If the local government handles these improperly, the central government's measures will be difficult to implement, and how can the Premier's plans to benefit the country and the people be realized? My humble ambition is to start from the bottom and work my way up, to work in a small place and start from the lower levels. This is the second reason why I cannot undertake the position due to my personal aspirations. The above reasons have been explained in detail at the meeting of the Presidium, and I have also spoken about them repeatedly in conversations with other comrades, and stated that if I am elected to serve in the central government, I will definitely resign. I have not been accommodated, and I am deeply ashamed to be selected. Now that the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been closed, I hereby submit this request to your committee, earnestly requesting you to understand my foolish sincerity, and select another capable person for the position of President of the Judicial Yuan, so that the important position will not be vacant. I am extremely grateful. Presented to the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, Wu Chaoshu, December 29th.</p>
<p>Letter of Resignation from Chairman of the Committee to request resignation from the task of Acting Chairman of the Special Diplomatic Committee. On December 23rd, I was publicly elected by the Second Preparatory Meeting of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee to be the Acting Chairman of the Special Diplomatic Committee. At that time, due to the serious international situation and the lack of a person in charge of diplomatic authorities, I reluctantly took on the temporary responsibility for a few days, waiting for the establishment of the new government. Now that there is someone in charge of diplomatic affairs and the government is about to be established, I should resign from the task of Acting Chairman of the Committee. The First Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been closed, and I hereby earnestly request your committee to approve it. Presented to the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, Wu Chaoshu, December 29th.</p>
<h3>Wu's Press Release</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Wu Chaoshu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. Because he was suffering from a cold and had not yet recovered, he did not go out all day after returning to the banquet. According to Wu's statement to reporters, he came to Beijing this time entirely as a representative of a province to attend the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee. Regarding serving in the central government, he had repeatedly stated to the press in Beijing that he did not want to hold any central positions. However, comrades in the press still published that he would be appointed to certain important positions. Since he had already stated his position in advance, he would definitely fulfill his promise like European and American politicians. Unexpectedly, comrades in the press wanted him to be a Chinese politician, and as a result of the election at the conference, he was also elected as the President of the Judicial Yuan. However, he maintained his original attitude and submitted a resignation to the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee. Regardless of whether the central government approves it or not, he is determined not to take office. As for the position of Chairman of the Diplomatic Committee, it was originally an emergency measure. Now that the minister has been selected and there is someone in charge, he will also resign immediately, so that he can concentrate on his duties. As for his aspirations this time, he hopes to engage in the construction of the eight counties of Qiongyai. Because Qiongyai is adjacent to Nanyang, with a humid and hot climate, it was originally a remote area, and is the southernmost part of our country. The Guangdong Provincial Government has now established an administrative chief to govern these eight counties, modeled after the special zone. He had been recommended as the administrative chief of that area, but had not yet taken office. He deeply felt that for nearly 20 years, he had repeatedly served in the central government and engaged in paperwork, and knew that he had achieved very little. Therefore, he was determined to change his course and change paperwork into pragmatic construction work, and go to Qiongyai to seek the development of the eight counties. The reporter also asked, "Sir, you have been appointed as the chairman of the Guangzhou Provincial Government, will you take office?" He replied, "I did not agree to this matter in advance, and I cannot hold this position, so I also plan to submit my resignation."</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Enters Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Have Official Declaration</p>
<p>The newly appointed Foreign Minister Chen Youren took the 9:30 AM special express train yesterday to Beijing to take office. This reporter met with Chen at the North Station on the train yesterday and had a brief conversation. Regarding the question of whether the diplomatic policy towards Japan will be changed, Chen's intention is that the new government will issue an official declaration after its establishment on New Year's Day. Chen also said that since he has been away from Beijing for a long time, everything needs to be studied together, and the diplomatic policy cannot be determined by one person alone. As for the issue of establishing a neutral zone in Jinzhou, Chen believes it is absurd. The Japanese ambassador published an article the other day saying that our country had proposed the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou. Chen said that he needed to go to Beijing to find out the truth.</p>

<h3>Mongolian and Tibetan Representatives Petition Ma Fuxiang to Return to Beijing to Resume His Post</h3>
<p>Carrying Petitions to Shanghai to Urge Him</p>
<p>Since Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, resigned and came to Shanghai, the offices of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in Beijing have sent telegrams one after another to persuade him to stay and petition the Executive Yuan to retain him. The United Office of Leagues and Banners of Mongolia, the Beijing Office of Tibet, and the Beijing Office of the Panchen Lama of Tibet sent Bawang Jianzan and Enhe Bamuer to Shanghai with a joint petition, asking Mr. Ma to return to Beijing to preside over Mongolian and Tibetan affairs. The reasons for their request are sincere. We find their original petition below: The petition is for requesting the matter. Representatives have jointly submitted a document to the Executive Yuan today, which reads: The petition is for jointly retaining the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and earnestly requesting that you follow the wishes of the people and not allow him to resign. We respectfully submit it to you for your review. Mr. Ma has served as an official and has held various important positions. He has extensive experience, profound knowledge, and upright character. At the beginning of his tenure in the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, during the opening of the Mongolian Conference, he was sincerely responsible and his achievements were evident. During his two years in office, he supervised his colleagues and maintained his determination in Mongolian and Tibetan affairs. There were no hasty or disruptive actions. The situation in Mongolia and Tibet is more peaceful and stable than in the mainland, which is already benefiting from his efforts. Although he has not fully realized his ambition to promote border administration due to the frequent troubles in the country, with the complexity of opinions on border affairs in recent years, any careless measures will cause public uproar. Fortunately, Chairman Ma is experienced, prudent, and does not avoid criticism. He has harmonized all parties without any conflict and has made many beneficial contributions, which is widely praised. The local people benefit from his work, which we believe is well known. We have heard that Chairman Ma has submitted his resignation. While his desire for a quiet retirement is admirable, at a time of national crisis, the safety of Mongolia and Tibet is unpredictable, and the affairs of Tibet are awaiting resolution. Chairman Ma has been in office for a long time and is familiar with the border situation. How can we allow him to leave, causing disappointment among the border people? We representatives come from Mongolia and Tibet and have a deeper understanding of the situation. The matter is of great importance. For the sake of the country and the local people, we jointly and earnestly request that you consider the feelings of the people and approve the retention of Chairman Ma in order to overcome the difficulties of the times and console the expectations of the people. We respectfully submit this petition for your review and instructions. We are extremely apprehensive. Respectfully presented to the President of the Executive Yuan, etc. We have also found that you have the full support of the northwest and are concerned about the safety of Mongolia and Tibet. The central government relies on you, and the border people deeply love and support you. At this time of national crisis and in the autumn of eastern danger, the conclusion of the Kangzang disputes also requires your contribution to stabilize the situation. You are the only one who can do it. This is the time to work together, not the time for you to withdraw. Therefore, we representatives of Mongolia and Tibet sincerely urge you to follow the wishes of the people and quickly return to Beijing to resume your post. Mongolia and Tibet will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. Presented by Ma, Chairman of the Tibetan Committee, Wu Heling and 17 others, representatives of the United Banner Office of Mongolia in Beijing, Gongjue Zhongni and others, representatives of the Tibetan Office in Beijing, Luosang Jianzan and others, representatives of the Tibetan Panchen Office in Beijing.</p>
<h3>More Overseas Chinese Remittances to Aid Horses</h3>
<p>Fiji Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Entrusts this newspaper to remit funds to Mr. Ma.</p>
<p>On December 18th, this newspaper received a notice from HSBC Bank that a telegraphic transfer of 1,500 taels of silver had been made from Yilu in Nanyang. Please come to collect it immediately. This newspaper immediately sent staff to contact them. However, because it was not known for what purpose the funds were to be used, although it was speculated that it might be a donation from patriotic overseas Chinese for General Ma, there was no evidence to support it. We could only wait for news before processing it. Now we have received a letter from the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association of the Western Black Province of the Philippines, stating that the funds were entrusted to this newspaper to be remitted to General Ma Zhanshan to aid military needs. Based on this, the funds will be handed over to the Bank of China for direct remittance to General Ma for his personal receipt.</p>

<p>New Discoveries in Tuberculosis Treatment Translated from a German Tuberculosis Sanatorium Magazine</p>
<h3>What is Tuberculosis Bacteria?</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis bacteria) is a rod-shaped bacterium. Its body is straight or slightly curved, with a length of about 1.5 millionths of a meter. It cannot be seen with the naked eye. A stained specimen made with a certain method and skilled means can only be seen with a microscope of 600 to 1,000 times magnification. It is an extremely small object.</p>
<p>In ancient times, China called it "cough worm." Now, everyone knows that tuberculosis bacteria are lung disease worms that do not belong to the animal kingdom. There are countless lower microorganisms around us, commonly known as microscopic organisms, which are invisible to the naked eye. These microscopic organisms are divided into animal and plant types. Those belonging to the animal type are called protozoa, and those belonging to the plant type are called fungi. These lower fungi belong to the saprophytic plant family and have no chlorophyll. Among fungi, they are divided into three types according to their shape and characteristics: "filamentous fungi," "budding fungi," and "fission fungi."</p>
<h3>The Colonial Policy of Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>The reproduction of fission bacteria is based on their own fission. That is, one becomes two, and two becomes four, gradually increasing. Therefore, they are called fission bacteria. Humans and other animals often develop diseases because of them. Therefore, they are called "pathogenic bacteria." According to different shapes, they are divided into "spherical bacteria," "rod-shaped bacteria," and "spiral bacteria." Tuberculosis bacteria are rod-shaped bacteria in fission bacteria. Tuberculosis bacteria are most abundant in the sputum of lung disease patients, often increasing or decreasing depending on the severity of the patient's condition. According to Dr. Haikreul of Germany, a piece of sputum from a lung disease patient contains 300 million tuberculosis bacteria. Therefore, someone who coughs up sputum once an hour has 7.2 trillion tuberculosis bacteria discharged from their body and scattered in the air. People in the world are exposed to them day and night. But where do these numerous pathogens come from? The body of fission bacteria has a fission function, as mentioned earlier. It increases and multiplies day by day. Originally, it was one bacterium, and then it gradually divided, from one to two, and from two to four, and so on. The power of proliferation gradually expanded. Now, let us assume that the speed of proliferation is one fission per hour. Then, in 24 hours, one bacterium will become 16 million. From this, we can infer the following: (1) How vigorous the reproductive power of bacteria is; (2) Why countless pathogens develop in the patient's body; (3) Why the patient's sputum has countless tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<h3>The Resistance of Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>The resistance of tuberculosis bacteria is very strong. Knowing the extent of its resistance is most important for tuberculosis prevention and treatment. When the sputum of tuberculosis patients is placed in the air, tuberculosis bacteria can survive for more than half a year. If placed in a dark room lacking light, they can survive for more than a year. This type of bacteria is particularly resistant to cold. It can withstand a temperature of minus ten degrees Celsius for six to seven weeks without dying. It is also more resistant to heat than other types of bacteria. Other types of bacteria die after two or three minutes at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, while this type of bacteria needs a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius for two or three minutes to die. However, it is most vulnerable to sunlight. It dies after five or six minutes of direct sunlight. It dies after one or two minutes of heat above 100 degrees Celsius. In terms of disinfection, tuberculosis bacteria from lung disease patients die after 30 seconds in 20 times the concentration of carbolic acid, after one minute in 100 times the concentration of carbolic acid, and after ten minutes in 1,000 times the concentration of mercuric chloride.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis Bacteria Dewaxing and Killing Method</h3>
<p>The cause of tuberculosis is tuberculosis bacteria. Once this bacteria enters the body, it forms nodules at that location, blocking the pathway of blood circulation. Furthermore, tuberculosis bacteria can secrete an acid-resistant wax to surround their bodies, preventing any external forces from entering. Therefore, even if various sterilizing agents are taken internally or injected, they cannot effectively reach the entity of the bacteria. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, blood serum therapy, and other therapies that medical experts have traditionally used have not been entirely successful. The theory that tuberculosis is incurable is prevalent in the world because of the lack of knowledge of this profound theory. Therefore, modern tuberculosis researchers continue to study this theory and spare no effort. As a result, they have created a chemical agent that kills tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanostil. This is a success based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the inventor of tuberculosis bacteria, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of tuberculosis bacteria dewaxing. According to current experimental reports from tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this agent has the effects of penetrating tuberculosis nodules, dissolving wax, and killing bacteria. It can radically cure first, second, and third-stage tuberculosis and has proven to be effective in tens of thousands of trials. In China, after chemical testing by the Central Health Testing Institute of the National Government, it was found to be safe, peaceful, and non-toxic, with absolutely no side effects. The therapeutic effects are briefly listed below: (1) When the effect of "Sanostil" is tested in an experimental dish, tuberculosis bacteria disappear their acid resistance after one minute. After three minutes, the tuberculosis bacteria are completely killed, with no exceptions.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments show that "Sanostil" can penetrate tuberculosis nodules. Examination of the tuberculosis bacteria within the nodules shows that they have completely lost their acid resistance, proving that the wax has been completely dissolved. (3) Patients taking "Sanostil" internally for about a week will immediately see their sputum dilute and their body temperature decrease, indicating good progress. (4) Further internal use of "Sanostil" for 30 to 60 days or more will show a significant increase in body strength, stimulated appetite, and a gradual easing of all symptoms, eventually achieving the great achievement of rebuilding their constitution.</p>

<p>The case between Rongchangxiang Neirong Store and landlord Cheng Linsheng of Yixin Lane, regarding eviction, where the tenant lost the case, has been reported in this newspaper. Rongchangxiang had a lease agreement with the landlord that was to expire at the end of January next year. The court ordered them to move out after the expiration. However, Rongchangxiang's false third-floor of the leased house was destroyed by fire in the autumn of the previous year, and immediately rebuilt into a formal three-story building. Rongchangxiang paid all the construction costs on behalf of the landlord, with a verbal agreement that they could continue to lease the property for seven years after the expiration of the current lease. Now, Cheng Linsheng has suddenly gone back on his word. Therefore, they hired lawyers Ye Fucang, Yu Hualong, and Wang Fubi to countersue Cheng Linsheng for breach of contract in the First Special Court, requesting the court to confirm the agreement that the lease term was extended for seven years, and to return the 50,000 taels of silver paid on behalf of the landlord for construction and renovation.

<p>Chen Mingshu Reports on the January 29th Student Protests and the Authorities' Handling of the Situation</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, the garrison commander of Beijing and Shanghai, was previously ordered by the National Government to investigate the Shanghai student protests and the authorities' handling of the situation. Chen has submitted a report on the investigation to the National Government. The National Government Standing Committee has decided to dismiss the Director of the Public Security Bureau and refer the responsibility of the City Party Headquarters to the Central Party Headquarters for review, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The original report submitted by Chen to the government is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter of reporting:</p>
<p>I have received a telegram from the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government, forwarding an order from Your Government, stating that the current Shanghai student protests and the authorities' handling of the situation should be investigated impartially by the garrison commander of Beijing and Shanghai, Chen Mingshu, for review and action.</p>
<p>In accordance with this order, I have investigated the cause of the Shanghai student incident, which stemmed from an incident that occurred around 10 AM on the 9th of this month. The Shanghai University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association was holding a meeting at the Ximen Youth Lecture Hall. During the meeting, Xu Xiucen, a representative from Peking University, and Jiang Fangye, a representative from National Central University, were beaten and arrested. A suspect, Wang Fusheng, was apprehended on the spot. Students from various schools gathered to appeal and surrounded the Municipal Government, the City Party Headquarters, and the City Public Security Bureau, resulting in the destruction of the City Party Headquarters and the encirclement of Mayor Zhang. As a result, the Municipal Government managed to find a representative from Peking University and handed him over to the students. The students demanded that the City Party Headquarters Committee Member Tao Baichuan and the City Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng be arrested and punished. At the same time, around 9 PM on the 9th, more than a thousand students from Jinan University in Zhenru assisted the Shanghai schools, claiming that they would petition to destroy the Zhenru Railway Station railroad. Fortunately, the military police maintained order and persuaded them to stop, and the situation was quickly restored. This is a general overview of the Shanghai student incident.</p>
<p>I, Mingshu, was ordered to investigate and immediately sent people to investigate the details of the incident. The reports from various parties are as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Government's report: Around 4 PM on the 9th of this month, several hundred transportation students suddenly arrived at the Municipal Government to demonstrate, shouting three slogans: (1) Release the arrested classmates (Peking University student Xu Xiucen); (2) Punish the Director of the Public Security Bureau; (3) Oppose the suppression of popular movements. Then, more than 4,000 students from Guanghua, Daxia, Fudan, Liangjiang Physical Education College, Jiangnan, Meizhuan, Jinan, Dongya Physical Education College, Merchant Marine, China Physical Education College, Fudan High School, Law School, and the Chinese Students Returning from Japan Association successively joined in. They insisted that the Mayor personally come out to meet them. They also organized a presidium, held a meeting, and decided to not return until their demands were met. The Mayor then came out to the plaza at 4:45 PM to meet the students. In addition to the above-mentioned demands, the students also demanded that the instigator be severely punished. The Mayor replied that since the Northeast Incident, the Municipal Government has not only never suppressed popular movements, but has often protected them. Regarding the request to release the arrested students, the Municipal Government has not received any reports of arrests. However, the Municipal Government is responsible for this incident in the city and will do its best to investigate and handle it. The Public Security Bureau will also investigate and deal with it according to the law. The students were dissatisfied with the Mayor's reply. The Mayor explained repeatedly, but did not gain their understanding. After a long standoff, the students said that the instigator was Tao Baichuan and demanded that he be brought to the Municipal Government immediately. The Mayor asked what evidence they had. The students said they had definite evidence. The Mayor replied that if they had definite evidence, he would investigate the case together, but since the party and government were not subordinate to each other, the Municipal Government had no authority to directly handle the matter and could only forward it to the Central Government for review. The students insisted on not accepting this and demanded that the Municipal Government send someone to the City Party Headquarters with the student representatives to question him. The Mayor agreed. The students also repeatedly pressed for severe punishment of the Director of the Public Security Bureau. The Mayor then issued an order to temporarily suspend the Director for failing to prevent the incident beforehand and failing to quickly solve the case afterward, pending investigation. The students were still dissatisfied and insisted that the Peking University student be released immediately, otherwise they would stay at the Municipal Government and vowed not to return to school. The Mayor replied that he did not know where the Peking University student was and could not do so. Many students shouted for the Mayor to exercise his power and order the Director of the Public Security Bureau to release the arrested Peking University student by telephone. The Mayor agreed to call the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the arrest of students. Not long after going upstairs, before the telephone was connected, the students shouted for Mayor Zhang to come down. The noise grew louder. The Mayor then returned downstairs to the plaza and instructed Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to go to the Public Security Bureau to inquire. At that time, the student representatives who went to find Committee Member Tao Baichuan returned and reported that they could not find him. The crowd erupted, still demanding the person from the Mayor. The Mayor could not cope with the situation, which was becoming very serious. The students then urged him to issue an arrest warrant. The Mayor explained the relationship of his position and said evidence could not be provided. The students ultimately did not listen and claimed that all the students could testify. The Mayor had no choice but to agree to issue an order, but the students were still not satisfied. They then held a representative meeting and decided to demand that the Municipal Government (1) immediately release the arrested classmates, (2) execute the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and (3) execute the murderers and instigators. The Mayor repeatedly persuaded and explained to the students from the evening of the 9th, but his voice was hoarse and he could not reason with them. The students were in a tumultuous state, surrounded on all sides, and forced him to stand with them. They firmly stated that they would not return to school unless the students were released. The Mayor could not leave. Before long, Secretary-General Yu returned to the Municipal Government and reported that he could not find him after inquiring. Before he finished speaking, the students clamored, saying that they would not stop until the goal of releasing and handing over the students was achieved. It was also heard that the arrested murderer had been transferred to the court, and they clamored again, demanding that the murderer be brought back for questioning and sent representatives to request the Municipal Government to send personnel to the court to negotiate, going back and forth three times, but to no avail. Around 4 AM on the morning of the 10th, the students, dissatisfied with the results of their demands, sent representatives to various middle schools to convene a second batch of students to join the demonstration, and decided to inform the Chamber of Commerce to call a strike and the unions to call a strike, further expanding the situation and making it more serious. They also proposed to limit the Mayor to one hour to hand over the Peking University students, otherwise they would take free action. After discussion by the presidium, it was decided to wait for the arrival of the second batch of students before making a joint decision. However, at this time, the internal and external transportation of the Municipal Government had already been cut off. The students' volunteer army checked, and no one was allowed to enter or exit without permission. All the entrances, doors, and staircases were crowded. Telegrams and telephones were also monitored. The staff of the Municipal Government did not disperse all night, and the order of work could not be maintained. The Mayor stood in the plaza in front and could not go upstairs without the consent of all the students. In this tense situation, the Mayor had lost his ability to persuade and explain, and had no freedom of action. By dawn, the court had released the murderer, Wang Fusheng, back to the Municipal Government, which slightly appeased the crowd. The presidium had already decided to organize a people's court, but the Mayor did not allow it. The students still proceeded freely, established a temporary court, and appointed Wu Yuncong, Wu Shumo, Hong Weiji, Wu Banghe, Ji Shiyuan, etc., representatives of five schools, as judges, and repeatedly requested the Mayor to appoint two people to participate. Sun Baorong and Guo Sang, staff members of the Municipal Government, participated, but clarified that they were observers. When the murderer was brought back from the court, they were cautioned not to beat the murderer. When questioned, the murderer refused to confess. The students shouted to beat him, and some hit him with bamboo sticks, and some with chair legs. Sun Baorong and Guo Sang persuaded them to stop, but it was ineffective. The murderer Wang Fusheng's confession was taken away by the students. Earlier, Secretary-General Yu went out again from the Municipal Government around 3 AM to inquire about the whereabouts of the Peking University students. Finally, before 10 AM, he found them in the water patrol team and brought them back to the Municipal Government. The students rejoiced, blew horns, and applauded to welcome them. Peking University student Xu Xiucen then stood on a table and reported the situation, saying that he was not injured. The students were greatly relieved, but their anger was still not appeased. Some were even more indignant after hearing Xu's report and the murderer's confession and still demanded that Committee Member Tao and Director Chen be arrested immediately, shouting slogans such as "Execute Tao Baichuan" and "Execute Chen Xizeng" and demanded that the Mayor stand on the table and respond. The Mayor then sincerely persuaded and comforted them, saying that he had not noticed the matter beforehand, nor had he received a report from the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and only after sending people to inquire did he manage to find Xu. The Director of the Public Security Bureau should bear what responsibility and should be investigated and dealt with severely according to the law. As the official in charge of a city, he had already telegraphed the Central Government to admit his responsibility and requested the dispatch of personnel to investigate. At this point, the students' emotions gradually calmed down, but they still demanded a time limit for arresting Tao Baichuan and Chen Xizeng, some limiting it to one day, and some to three days. The Mayor agreed to handle the matter within the time limit, and the students all dispersed, at which time it was already past 11 AM. Subsequently, students from China Public School and Wensheng School came to the Municipal Government one after another with the same demands, and they were also dispersed after the Mayor responded. According to the report from the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, at 9 AM on the 9th of this month, the University Joint Association held its 21st representative meeting at the Youth Lecture Hall. Committee Member Tao Baichuan of the City Party Headquarters attended to provide guidance as usual (the Association had previously reported to the City Party Headquarters). According to the students present, there were many people resembling detectives in the meeting place, and some Party Headquarters staff members were disguised as observers. Committee Member Tao left halfway after the representative from National Central University, Jiang, gave a report. When Representative Jiang was reporting, someone in the audience shouted to beat him. The representatives, seeing that the situation was not good, hurriedly dispersed. Some of the Association staff remained in the building to work. Unexpectedly, Representative Xu from Peking University and Representative Jiang from National Central University, as soon as they left the meeting place, were surrounded. Representative Xu was weak and was pulled into a black car parked by the roadside. Representative Jiang was strong and resisted, and was beaten as a result. At the same time, those who remained in the meeting heard the news and rushed out to rescue them, and the thugs scattered. Only one person, Wang Fusheng, was captured by the crowd. The time of the incident was around noon. Members of the Association immediately notified the various schools to gather and petition the various agencies for rescue. Almost all the faculty and students unanimously believed that the incident was the result of the City Party Headquarters Committee Member Tao Baichuan, Wu Kaixian, and the Public Security Bureau Director Chen working together to plan it. The students presented fifteen points to the Municipal Government regarding this matter. Here is a summary of the questions raised by the students: (1) In the past, the Party Headquarters notified the Public Security Bureau to send police to protect meetings, but on this day, no one was sent. (2) Tao Baichuan usually stayed until the end of the meeting when guiding popular organizations, but on this day, he left halfway. (3) When going to the City Public Security Bureau to petition, the Director was found at the Party Headquarters. (4) When going to the City Party Headquarters to petition, why did Tao Baichuan avoid them, and why did he move his family away? (5) Director Chen said he did not know the situation, so why was Representative Xu still found in the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team? (6) Some students personally saw plainclothes officers resting in the branch office across from the Youth Lecture Hall. (7) Some students personally saw Party Headquarters staff members during the beating of the Representative from National Central University. (8) Tao Baichuan has always been consistent with Wu Kaixian. These are the points that they suspect. Most of the members of the Association are members of the Party, so the Party Headquarters and the Association should be able to work together. However, according to the investigation results, the Party Headquarters and the Association are very much at odds. It seems that the Party members in the Association refuse to be directed by the Party Headquarters because of their personal relationships. On the Party Headquarters side, they resent the Association for not being directed. It was also found that there are factions among the student Party members, so it is difficult to be consistent externally. In the academic world, because a small number of reactionary elements are stirring up trouble, the Party Headquarters' response has been inappropriate, leading to a situation that is out of control. According to the students, the elements in the academic world are also quite complex. The above is the situation reported by the Shanghai Party and government agencies. After sending people to interview the faculty and students of the various schools in Shanghai, the report stated that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association (abbreviated as the Association among the students) held its 21st representative meeting at the Ximen Youth Lecture Hall around 10 AM on the 9th. Committee Member Tao Baichuan of the City Party Headquarters attended to provide guidance (the Association had previously reported to the City Party Headquarters). According to the students present, there were many people resembling detectives in the meeting place, and some Party Headquarters staff members were disguised as observers. Committee Member Tao left midway after the representative from National Central University, Jiang, gave a report.

Representative Xu was weak and was pulled into a black car parked by the roadside.</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>Representative Jiang was strong and resisted, and was beaten as a result. At the time, members of the Association notified the various schools to gather and petition for rescue. The faculty and students were of one voice in claiming that this incident was the result of collusion between City Party Committee Tao Baichuan, Wu Kaixian, and Public Security Bureau Director Chen. The students raised fifteen points to present to the municipal government, and they now summarize the questions they had: (1) In the past, the Party Headquarters would notify the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police protection for the meetings, but no one was dispatched on this day. (2) Tao Baichuan usually stayed until the end of the meeting when he was guiding popular groups, but he left midway on this day. (3) When they went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to petition, the director was found at the Party Headquarters. (4) When they went to the City Party Headquarters to petition, why did Tao Baichuan avoid them, and why did he move his family to avoid them? (5) Director Chen said he was unaware, so why was Representative Xu found in the water patrol team of the Public Security Bureau? (6) Some students personally saw plainclothes teams resting in the branch office opposite the Youth Lecture Hall. (7) Some students personally saw Party Headquarters staff members during the beating of the Representative from National Central University. (8) Tao Baichuan has always been consistent with Wu Kaixian. These are the points that they suspect. Most of the members of the Association are Party members, so the Party Headquarters and the Association should be able to get along, but according to the investigation, the Party Headquarters and the Association are very much at odds. It seemed that the Party members in the Association did not want to be directed by the Party Headquarters because of personal relationships. On the side of the Party Headquarters, they resented the Association for not being directed, and there are also factions among the student Party members, so it is difficult to be consistent externally. On the academic side, because a small number of reactionary elements are stirring up trouble, the Party Headquarters' response has been inappropriate, so it has reached a point where it cannot be salvaged. According to the students, the elements in the academic world are quite complicated." The above is the situation reported by the academic world.</p>
<p>I believe that in this incident, most of the students were motivated by patriotism, but at a time when society is so complex, it cannot be guaranteed that a small number of dangerous elements will not take advantage of the situation to stir things up. However, the crux of the matter was caused by the conflict with Wang Fusheng. Combining the reports from all sides and the general opinion in Shanghai, it cannot be denied that the actions of the City Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau were not without errors. As for the incident of destroying the railway in Zhenru, the investigation report inevitably mentions that there were Communist elements attempting to expand the incident. However, it was difficult to obtain concrete evidence after arresting the culprit on the spot.</p>
<p>In accordance with the previous order, I hereby report the details of the investigation for your review.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the National Government,</p>

<h3>Citizens' Federation Advocates Citizen Election</h3>
<p>Submitted to the National Government Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation submitted a report to the Executive Yuan of the National Government yesterday, stating: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan,</p>
<p>With respect, the Republic of China has been established for twenty years. The country is facing internal and external troubles, and the national crisis is pressing. The reasons for this are numerous, but the lack of established democracy and the lack of implemented autonomy are the most important issues. Now, under the tide of establishing democracy and implementing autonomy, integration follows division. Therefore, in addition to resolving the national crisis, we must first show faith in democracy and autonomy. Shanghai is the economic center and cultural hub of our country. The level of civic intelligence is sufficient to exercise autonomy. Now, when the position of mayor is vacant, we should first appoint a respected, virtuous, and experienced person who has long been admired and respected by the entire city of Shanghai as mayor to serve as a transition. Then, we should complete autonomy and implement the election of a citizen-elected mayor, to set a precedent for the country. The struggles of the past two years have been to establish democracy and implement autonomy. We respectfully submit this report, and we implore you to investigate and implement it. Respectfully, the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jinqing Resigns as Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinqing, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday.</p>
<p>The document stated: I, Jinqing, was humbly entrusted with managing the affairs of the Ministry. At the beginning of my appointment, I originally wanted to do my best to follow and assist, working together for production, hoping to live up to expectations. However, since the floods, the alarms on the borders, internal and external troubles have been pressing, the national situation is on the verge of danger, affecting finance. There is no fundamental plan, and perfunctory compliance will only increase my guilt. Now that the central government is being rebuilt, political reforms are being implemented, and society's expectations are even greater, the relationship between people's livelihood is extremely important. Broad plans and remedies depend on finding the right people. I believe that I am mediocre and should give way to more capable individuals. Therefore, I sincerely state my situation and request resignation. I humbly ask you to examine and forward this request for the selection of a replacement. (The following is omitted)</p>
<h3>The Dasin Dye Factory Case is Fully Resolved</h3>

<p>Injured Workers Receive Subsidies for Medical Expenses</p>
<p>After the tragic case at the Dasin Dye Factory on Binlang Road, Xiaoshadu, in Western Shanghai, the case has been completely resolved after extensive mediation by the City Party Headquarters and other parties. Representatives from the city's labor community went to the hospital to express their condolences to the injured and donated funds to help them. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<h3>City Government Investigation</h3>
<p>After receiving a report from the Dyeing Industry Trade Union Silk Affairs Office that the Dasin Dye Factory used force to expel workers from the factory, resulting in a tragic incident, the Municipal Government specially instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to promptly investigate and report the matter. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau reported the handling process to the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Mediation Process</h3>
<p>After the City Party Headquarters and other parties took on the role of mediator, the previous day they jointly decided on five measures. Xu Yefu, Section Chief of Civil Training of the City Party Headquarters, contacted the factory workers, and Zhu Wenqi, Chairman of the Silk and Cotton Weaving Industry Association, contacted the factory shareholders. As a result, the labor and capital parties signed an agreement to resolve the issue yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Resolution Measures</h3>
<p>The measures to resolve the Shanghai Dasin Mercerizing Dye Factory closure dispute are as follows: (A) Regarding the factory closure issue: (1) Each employee will receive 70 yuan as severance pay. (2) Wages for the following month (October) will be paid in full. Each person's advance of ten yuan will be deducted from the wages. (3) The industry association will advise all factories that in the future, if there are factory closure matters, they must first submit them to the Party and government agencies for approval. (4) If the Dasin Factory is reopened by the old shareholders in the future, they must give priority to employing the old workers. If it is reopened by new shareholders, the old shareholders will do their best to introduce the old workers. (B) Regarding the injury issue: (1) The injured workers who were beaten by the police and hospitalized will receive 35 yuan each for their injury expenses, and the seriously injured worker will receive 80 yuan, as well as medical expenses, etc., all of which will be fully responsible by the mediator, Mr. Zhu Wenqi.

Our association is deeply sorry and hereby expresses its apology. This is addressed to the Silk Affairs Office of the Shanghai Dyeing Industry Trade Union.</p>
<h3>Yongan No. 2 Factory Labor-Capital Dispute Scheduled for Mediation</h3>
<p>Homicide Awaits Court Resolution</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Thoroughly Investigates the Truth Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the tragic incident at Yongan Textile Factory No. 6 in Wusong Yunzaobang, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau requested instructions from the Municipal Government. Yesterday, they were ordered to formally mediate the labor-capital dispute on the second, and to thoroughly investigate the case of the arrested labor representatives. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Order for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and implement two measures: (1) The homicide case will be resolved by the local court. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a mediation meeting immediately to address the profit-sharing and labor-capital conditions, and will request the City Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to participate in the handling. (3) The Public Security Bureau will send police to protect and strictly prevent the Red bandits from instigating.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Mediation</h3>
<p>After receiving the order, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau requested the City Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to convene a labor-capital mediation committee at 9:00 AM on January 2 at the Social Affairs Bureau in Xiaonanmen to mediate according to law regarding profit-sharing and labor-capital conditions. Yesterday, the Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Trade Union and Yongan No. 2 Factory were notified to each send two responsible representatives to attend on time and await mediation.</p>
<h3>Request for Protection</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Trade Union submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Report on the fact that the capitalists of Yongan No. 2 Factory are falsely accusing good people of theft, and we humbly request an investigation and protection." It was discovered that the labor incident occurred earlier and has been reported. Unexpectedly, the factory capitalists, seeing that all their cunning tricks could not deceive the government agencies, resorted to ruthless means, accusing Shen Yongming, the executive director, of being a thief in the local court, and dispatched police to arrest him and imprison him. This deprives our thousands of workers of their leadership, allowing them to do whatever they want and cruelly harm the workers. Their intention is clear. All the workers are extremely terrified and have no way to seek help. Therefore, they humbly request an investigation and protection. We humbly ask you to strictly order the capitalists not to falsely accuse the workers and to provide appropriate protection.</p>
<h3>Authorities Thoroughly Investigate</h3>
<p>After Jin Yaowen and Shen Yongming, directors of the Eighth District Textile Industry Trade Union, were arrested by the local court, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau dispatched An Huawen yesterday to thoroughly investigate the truth at the time and the recent situation, the workers' injuries, and the arrest process for reporting.</p>
<h3>National Doctor Yang Yanhe Provides Treatment</h3>
<p>Physician Yang Yanhe, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, recognizes that Shanghai has an excessive population, difficult living conditions, and many who fall ill, their suffering and groans are extremely pitiful. Therefore, he has designated two hours, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, during his morning clinic hours as a free treatment period. Extremely poor patients also receive half-price medicine. This has been supported by more than a dozen people, including Xie Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Lvdeng, Zhang Zhijiang, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Xiaoting, Qin Runqing, and Yan Youyu, who have helped negotiate extremely low consultation fees. Leaders in the medical community, including Ding Zhongying, Zhu Nanshan, Huang Yizhong, Jiang Shifang, and Shen Xinjiu, Jiang Youcheng, and others, have created and donated a plaque with the words "Benevolence in Mind" to commemorate his joy in doing good. Mr. Yang's clinic is located at No. 80 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road.</p>

<h3>Japanese Man Kills Chinese Man with Mask</h3>
<p>Failed to Forcefully Borrow Money</p>
<p>Black Mask, Gunshots Kill</p>
<p>Inside the Santou Foreign Firm opened by a Japanese man at No. 8, A-Character, Nanxun Road, Hongkou, a tragic case occurred the night before in which a Japanese man shot and killed the owner, Shen Quanfu, a Suzhou native. The perpetrator was very clever in committing the crime. After investigation by the criminal police of the Japanese Consulate, the perpetrator was arrested. This case is quite bizarre. The general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Japanese Man Assassinates with Mask</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM on the 28th, a young Japanese man in his twenties suddenly arrived at the Santou Foreign Firm established by a Japanese man at No. 8, A-Character, Nanxun Road. He forced Shen Quanfu (48 years old), a Suzhou native, who was the owner of the firm, to borrow money. Shen did not allow it, and the Japanese man took out a black cloth hood from his pocket, covered his face, and climbed the stairs to find Shen. Quanfu was shocked and went out to stop him. The Japanese man took out a handgun and shot Shen. With a loud bang, the bullet hit Shen's abdomen. After committing the crime, the perpetrator shouted loudly, "Robber! Robber!" Taking advantage of this opportunity, he fled.</p>
<h3>Report to the Consulate for Investigation</h3>
<p>After this tragic murder occurred, a man named Yu Dao in the same house went to the Japanese Consulate to report it. According to Yu Dao's wife, she heard the sound of a handgun being fired. When she came out of the room to look, she saw Shen Quanfu had been shot and fell to the ground, and the masked perpetrator had already escaped. The Japanese Consulate immediately dispatched Judicial Director Okumura and criminal investigators Sato Aika to investigate the scene. The Hongkou Police Department also dispatched detectives to pursue the murderer.</p>
<h3>Investigate the Perpetrator</h3>
<p>After being ordered to investigate this tragic case, the Japanese detectives first went to the Santou Foreign Firm to question the owner, Fujita Beisanro. They learned that the perpetrator was a young man in his twenties. After detailed investigation on the spot, they discovered that a former Japanese employee of the Santou Foreign Firm named Takeshita Yoshiaki was highly suspected. Later, it was learned that the Japanese man had transferred to the Matsuno Foreign Firm at No. 149 Wusong Road as a staff member. The Japanese detectives determined that Takeshita was highly suspected of committing the crime and immediately rushed to search.</p>
<h3>Evidence Found Late at Night</h3>
<p>At 11:00 PM that night, Japanese Consulate Judicial Director Okumura, along with his staff member Nagata and detectives, as well as Fujita and others from the Santou Foreign Firm, first went to the Matsuno Foreign Firm on Wusong Road to investigate. At that time, the perpetrator was not in the firm. Then, at 9:00 AM on the 29th, Japanese criminal police officers Sato Aika and another officer went to search Takeshita Yoshiaki's residence on the second floor of No. 645 Miller Road. As a result, they found a handgun and four bullets in his room, and also found the black mask used in the crime on his bed. With conclusive evidence, they carried out the arrest.</p>
