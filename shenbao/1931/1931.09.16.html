<p>（東京）　日本對於中村事件、不致在滿洲作武力示威之景象、邇來愈益顯著、軍界之呼號呌囂、雖依然不絶、窺其本意、實以反對撙節軍費爲主、惟據善於觀察時局者意見、局勢仍極危險、第因軍閥領袖與報界已知上星期内劍拔弩張之狀、行將釀成一發難收自陷窘境之局面、故危機已不若日前之甚耳、南陸相今日語新聞記者、渠認中村事件應遵從輿論解决、軍隊將遵民意行事、大阪每日新聞爲日本勢力最雄厚之日報、亦主張和平從事、勿過操切、使事勢陷至無可挽救云、（十五日國民社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>責任心</h3>
<p>責任心之動。不僅動於職務上之義所當爲。而亦動於良心上之情不自已也。爲職務驅使而動。一旦職務上遇有困難。則負責之心。難保不因畏懼而懈怠。爲良心所驅使而動。則愈遇困難。愈肯奮勇而努力。此不待試騐而知者也。此次水災如是之慘酷。救災人員吾取斷言必無如前清時代之以辦賑爲利藪者。有之則决非人類。亦决無視此次救災之事。如一般普通差事而以敷衍爲盡職者。有之則遺誤災民之生命不少。即爲我中華全民族之罪人。蓋以被水災民。待救如斯之迫切。决不容一時一刻之延挨。亦决不容一錢一米之浪費。必將所捐得或請得之賑銀賑糧。一一轉施於災民。無絲毫涓滴之糜濫。且必迅速敏捷而勿稍延擱。方與災民有實益。若一念圖安適。住必大旅社。行必頭等車。食必外國菜。在彼人之意。或且以我爲災民盡義務。應當有此報酬。而不知無形中已少救數十條性命矣。又若一念惰偷。今日待開朝。明朝待後日。遇風雨不往。舟車不安適不往。危險之區又不敢遽往。如此遷延。彼以爲不過一二日之遲遲我行。無甚關係。而不知已有不少災民。索之於枯魚之腹矣。使其救災之熱心。果出於良心所驅使者。必將寤寐不安。而决不敢稍生圖安與畏難之念。可斷言也。</p>
<p>今之負治水防災之責者。遭此鉅變無數生靈。送葬於彼一念之疏忽。苟有人心。必深自隱痛。然而彼尙强顏自辨曰。如此鉅災。實出意外。非人力所能抵抗。雖能者亦無如何也。有代爲寬其責者。亦曰此等鉅災。百年未有。防災人員。缺乏經騐。亦實情也。殊不知缺乏經騐。不過臨時之手足無措耳。然此次災禍之種因。實不在臨時之無措。而在平時之廢弛。忘其自身所負之責任。防災之料。用之於他種建設。防災之欵。用之於他種事業。而且隨處與水爭陸。迫使水無容身之地而横决。其危險早在人意之中。故其對於職務。實非尋常疏忽可比。而百口無從推諉者。今日遭輿論之唾駡。受政府之處分。苟一反省。實亦無詞以自解也。茲者事已至此。徒咎旣往。亦無所益。惟望從前負責人員而今後仍負責者。其速激發天良。一反從前之所爲。以圖補過。從前未負責而今後始負責人員。則應以此次之事變爲鑒戒。而勉力以圖後患之消弭。蓋經此鉅大之敎訓。無論何人。良心上必有所感動。故此後不負救災與防災之責則已。苟期負之。而仍如從前之泄泄沓沓者。尙得謂有心肝者乎。</p>

<h3>鄂省救災工作近况</h3>
<p>救災分會電請總會撥欵</p>
<p>振救隊已陸續出發各縣</p>
<p>漢口通信、鄂省自救災分會成立後、與急振會切取聯絡、對於武漢及各縣救災工作、已作第一步之進行、各振救隊、亦已分途出發、惟江水連日並未稍退、人民痛苦自未能立時解除、一旦振欵不繼、恐仍將淪爲餓莩、救災分會對此極爲注意、業已電請總會、迅撥鉅欵接濟、以免中輟、而於災民之衣食住行諸問題、同時設法維持、急振會省政府警備部亦共同致力、茲將各方情况、分誌如次、</p>
<p>電請總會迅撥鉅欵　鄂省災區遼闊、災民衆多、武漢一隅、共有災民四十餘萬、施衣施粥、每日至少需洋四十萬元、各縣災民共達千萬、專就口糧而論、每日每人需洋五角、計須五十萬元、現國民政府所頒振欵十七萬、及各方匯來振欵、總數不過百餘萬元、僅敷兩日之需、竭蹶情形、可以想見、救災分會特於十日電呈總會委員長宋子文、請將收到振欵、從豐撥匯、俾濟眉急、文云、上海宋委員長鈞鑒、佳電奉悉、撥衛生欵即遵辦、惟美金捐欵用途、僅限漢口一隅、外縣區廣振急、需用尤多、分會實無力應付、業經佳電陳明、務懇迅將收到振欵、從豐撥匯、俾濟眉急爲禱、湖北分會執行委員會叩蒸、該會又以在贛購米一萬石、在皖購米三萬石、欵項無着、復電總會云、鄂省災後需米、已承江西何部長代辦振米萬石、需洋八萬五千元、又在皖省購米三萬石、亟須派員携欵前往押運來漢、惟米欵無着、請即先撥四十萬元應用、</p>
<p>收容難民加緊防疫　武漢難民收容所、原設有多處、如漢口之慈善會·新市塲·怡和堆棧·寳林堆棧·萬壽宫·太平會館·長沙會館·天成牛皮棧·帝主宫·聖若瑟女校·堤街上段同益會·天寳巷潛仁堂·南城公所·新華公司各處、武昌之洪山·蛇山·鳳凰山·珞珈山·武漢大學·文華中學·藝術專門·警官學校·第一二三九各中學、漢陽之龜山·赫山·梅子山·歸元寺各處、均經設所收容、惟人數太多、不能盡量容納、當局爲便於施振及管理起見、已决定專以洪山珞珈山收容、現已趕搭蓆棚、限於十六日以前竣工、防疫方面、經中央衛生防疫組及省市立各醫院、上海紅十字會等、分途施救、難民死亡頗少、惟最近赫山一帶發現霍亂傷寒混合症、傳染者達一萬餘人、形勢頗爲危急、刻已由中央衛生防疫組駐漢辦事處曁上海紅十字會前往施行注射矣、</p>
<p>架橋工程未臻完善　漢口在水深時、全市交通胥恃舟楫、僱資頗昻、富厚之家尙可支持、貧困者則不敢問津、迨水勢稍退、救災分會成立、因决定架設全市臨時渡橋、共分五大幹線、施工三日、即已竣事、惟因倉卒舉辦、尙有未臻完善之處、如橋身過仄、不易通行、板架不堅、屢致顚覆、而橋線太短、除重要街市外、餘仍不免涉水之苦、關於一二兩點、已由公安局致函該會、加以改善、而市民聲請延長橋線者、尤爲迫切、聞該會尊重民意、已責成承辦該項工程之趙煥章分别辦理、又上海社會局派來工作之俞天碧、亦對維持木橋交通有所建議、一行人須左來右往、不得任意行走、以礙交通、二禁止携有笨重物件或挑担者往來、以免危險該會亦已留備參考矣、</p>
<p>物品平價房屋免租　水災發生時、行營爲防止奸商高抬物價、特嚴令商會　飭各商、對於米炭油鹽各項日用必需品不得乘機漲價、違者以軍法從事、顧日久玩生、物價又逐漸增漲、並有以劣貨朦取高價等情事、市民苦之而無可如何、近經警備司令部查悉、當將㚥商拘押究辦、以儆其餘、並於十一日由該部參謀長葉蓬親赴商會、商請該會主席賀衡夫、召集各商代表開談話會、再三曉以利害、並經全體决定、組織評議物價臨時委員會、推定機器米·米糧·麵粉·煤油·雜貨各帮代表爲委員、即日成立、從事評議、此外尙有爲人民迫切要求者、爲房租豁免問題、蓋市民慘被水淹、救死不遑、實無餘力繳租、連日紛請救災分會急賑會轉知各業主、豁免房租三月、聞該會即將函商業主會、一律豁免、以恤民艱、</p>
<p>限定各縣賑欵用途　各縣災區極廣、災民待賑孔殷、雖有各方賑欵撥縣、僅能支持一時、省政府深慮各縣有移挪情事、致礙施賑進行、特於十一日嚴令各縣長、切加注意、無論中央地方各賑會發給之賑欵、或本處自籌之欵、祇能用於賑濟、不得移作他項用費、倘有濫移賑欵爲别用之事、决從嚴懲處不貸、（九月十一日）</p>

<p>「亮工等以爲應分三大時期、謹爲條陳如左（一）</p>
<p>急振時期、急振云者、似應以救濟災民生命爲第一要義、積水未退、不可一日中止、在此時期所認爲一定之標準者、莫如權衡被災地有無自救力量、參以災情輕重爲斷、中央嚴委員主張甚是、我省被災縣分、佔全省三分之二、已往者無論矣、將來支配急振時、除蕪湖災情旣重、又爲大江南北難民就食之區、並爲長江治安重要之地、應認爲有特殊情形外、其他被災各縣、根據急振意義、分别支配、縱不能盡得其平、較之依據地畝或人口似勝一等、此一時期也、（二）冬振時期、冬振云者、俟水退後補救圩堤損壞、維持災民衣食、務使將來不致廢止工作爲目的、在此時期、似應察看各縣圩堤損壞程度、爲支配冬振多寡之根據、除老弱酌予救濟外、本以工代振主張商同地方辦理、此二時期也、（三）春振時期、春振云者、爲青黄不接之時、没有振欵無以爲活、没有種籽、無以歸農、在此時期、以應按各縣被災地畝爲支配振欵多寡根據、因被災地畝所待救濟、大致相同、即災民亦可因而推定、其他皆可不論、此三時期也、總之救災無善策、古有明言、若以一定目標、爲自始至終不二辦法、恐不足以昭平允、」</p>

<p>青光人才球藝、均在滬東之上、惟周旋之初、滬東頗予觀衆良好之印象、馮惠甫一鼓下壘、首開紀錄、青光幾度進攻陳華輅凱旋而歸、從此扶搖直上、控制全局、上半時二十二比四、下半時、雙方戰將互換各逞身手、顧一倒局勢已成、滬東努力、終難有效、結果青光六十二比十二勝滬東裁判員邵驥、</p>

<h3>女籃球開塲賽東南大勝曁南</h3>
<p>三十一比十八</p>
<p>東南曁南兩江之三角女子籃球、昨晚第一塲、東南以三十一比十八大勝曁南、得决賽權、裁判員邵驥、</p>
<p>東南隊一路順風　潘月英單手一托、打開兩隊紀錄、一人連得五分、曹秀娥造成七比○、司徒薇目擊時艱、與陳玉芷、連合奪四五分、第二節潘月英獨得七分、司徒薇獨得五分、上半時結果十四比十分、下半時東南以後備軍竇文德替周文娟、是爲東南全盛時代、第三節潘曹竇合得十二分、結果三十一比十五、</p>
<p>潘月英全塲稱賞　東南潘月英、昨晚獨得二十一分、全塲稱賞、擲射準確、身手敏捷、兩隊翹楚、東南前鋒、甚有合作功夫、惟有時不能分佈全塲、使敵人顧東失西、常麕集一處爲病、後衛三人、防守嚴密、位置亦甚適當、蔣懷萱應付裕如、昨不能充分奔走、否則當更出色、胡王之勇敏可取、實爲兩江之勁敵、</p>
<p>司徒薇孤掌難鳴　曁南隊可觀者司徒一人而已、進退有方、所得十五分中、司徒得十三、其他二鋒、俱東西狂撞、莫知所之、三鋒擲籃均欠準確、司徒亦常可入不進、後衛尙佳、將終結時、前鋒陳玉芷忽病倒出塲、司徒薇退居後衛、以監視潘月英、終不能挽回頺勢矣、</p>

<h3>十項推鍾連基</h3>
<p>昨日爲全能運動第二日、所賽項目、僅十項運動後半部故田徑場上依然冷落、幸有國術比賽之職員、及運動員、以及男男女女之參觀者、造成熱閙氣象、惜天公不作美、在十項高欄比賽完畢後、鐵餅正在開始比賽時、大雨傾盆、繼續不斷者約半小時、一般出賽裁判員、運動員、以及童子軍等、無不頓成落湯之鷄、不得已宣告停賽、於是各尋躱雨之所、煞時間司令台與運動員休息處、擠得滿坑滿谷、不二十分鐘、跑道上與出賽場中、積水甚多、幸而浮雲吹過、兩點即止、一聲命令、童子軍以及場上之小二等、你呼我應、相率作軀水運動、傾刻間跑道上滴水全無、乃繼續比賽、但出賽場中、已積水數寸、故昨日十項運動之後半部成績不佳、</p>
<h3>十項後半部批評</h3>
<p>昨日舉行之十項後半部、除高欄一項外其餘無不受天雨影響、成績欠佳、羅得賢本預料可與鍾君競爭、但撑竿跳與標槍兩項、合計共傳九十餘分、實吃虧不少、以後希望羅君於成績欠佳之各項運動努力加工、鍾君之鐵餅、與一千五百米、以後亦宜時加練習、否則將來全運會萬難與遼寗之張齡佳、以及北平等處之十項選手競奪優勝、梁君添成爲跳遠與三級跳之良材、以後專一練習不可貪多、致單項之成績無甚長進、故十項運動宜放棄練習、</p>
<h3>國術比賽預賽</h3>
<p>市運動會國術競賽、於昨日下午一時許、舉行開幕禮、到者有褚民誼·吴鑑泉·佟忠義·武匯川·葉大密·勞伯視·劉德生·及裁判葉良·陳緒良·馬岳良等、行禮如儀、首由國術部主席陳稼軒、告知各會員規則上應注意各點、及運動員應抱之態度、次褚民誼致訓詞、勗大家努力進步、爲國術界爭榮、次即宣佈搏擊開始競賽、甫賽畢一組、大雨忽至、場中人員紛紛避往司令臺及籃球房、雖方不及丈之蓆棚、亦避三十餘人之多、大抵衣履盡濕、宛如落湯之鷄、三時雨霽、復行競賽、但雨後臺滑、致競賽員曹祖發跌落一交臂上、略受微傷、綜計輕量級男子賽六組、輕中量級二組、女子一組共賽九組、成績如左、</p>
<p>男子</p>
<p>（輕量級）第一組　四王希結勝一五翁榊勝</p>
<p>（輕量級）第二組　一蜀少浙勝二四董松祥</p>
<p>（輕量級）第三組三一陳震儀勝四八宋保茂</p>
<p>（輕量級）第四組二六竺清鏞勝四九周雨生</p>
<p>（輕量級）第五組　六顧暮蟬勝　五魏漢路</p>
<p>（輕量級）第六組五七劉欽俊勝　三張寳興</p>
<p>（輕中量級）第七組四七劉鳳鳴勝一一曹靜波</p>
<p>（輕中量級）第八組　八王忠孝勝三三曹祖發</p>
<p>女子</p>
<p>（重量級）第一組（三）翟連元勝（二）高君珠</p>
<p>是日競賽首一組、打法較遜、但自二組以後、成績漸好、末後更佳、雙方拳腿並用、多屬合法、尤以四十七號劉鳳鳴、六號顧暮蟬、三十一號陳震儀爲最好、至於四十八號宋保茂、五號魏漢銘、雖不幸落選、但身法擊法、均無瑕疵、女子一組、擊法尙好、惟氣力不長、裁判員不得不將時間略爲縮短、下臺後各報記者爭爲之攝影、至於各運動員、皆能遵守秩序、服從規則、尤爲難能可貴、殊爲國術前途幸、</p>
<p>又昨日因天雨、致有一部份競賽員退出、茲定於今日下午一時起、繼續比賽、昨日未比賽各員、望於上午十二時到齊、如今日再不蒞塲、與賽即作棄權論、須各注意云、</p>
<h3>五千米競走表演石金生第一</h3>
<p>自連得上海萬國競走錦標以來、練習競走者一時風起水湧、更兼在史君友惠指導之下競走會之組織井井、練習有恒有法、故進步甚速昨日田徑場五千米表演結果石金生以二十六分三十二秒五分之二奪得第一、觀石君之姿勢、自始至終上下一體頗爲可觀、較之昨前兩届萬國競走時之姿勢已進步不少、第二張造九與第三侯根仁之姿勢、亦頗優良、但大腿肌肉不如石金生、故步子速率、較爲遲緩、第四謝行導之步子甚小、雖速度極快、終覺吃虧、得位置之四人、俱爲中華隊競走老將、願諸君等繼續努力、非特在全運會中有良好之表演、本届萬國競走仍須保持錦標、爲我中華爭榮光也、茲將昨日表演之名次與成績如下、</p>
<p>第一石金生</p>
<p>第二張造九</p>
<p>第三侯根仁</p>
<p>第四謝行導</p>
<p>成績二十六分三十二秒五分之二</p>
<h3>排網球昨未賽</h3>
<p>女排球複賽改今日下午二時昨日午後傾盆大雨、男子網球、一塲未賽、女子網球複賽兩場、亦因雨延至今日下午二時比賽、籃球照常舉行、</p>
<h3>女五十米重賽</h3>
<p>改十九日下午二時舉行女子五十米、除第一名外、行將重賽、大會函致馬毓芳司徒薇薛奇定李寳惠四女士、於昨日下午二時舉行、但届時均未到場、恐各函郵寄發出、未能按時收到、乃由競賽主任沈嗣良决定再定於本星期六（十九日）下午二時舉行、</p>

<h3>男女游泳第二日二百米胸泳决賽全國新紀錄</h3>
<p>由凌崇舉創造　成績三分二十七秒十分之八</p>
<p>原有全國紀錄由馬智輝保持時間三分二十八秒</p>
<p>全市運動會游泳比賽、昨晚在交大游泳池繼續舉行、各運動員因决賽關係、無不精神十足、謀最後之勝利、於是各項比賽、較前日競爭更爲劇烈、引起全塲數白餘觀衆、伸頸注目、興味之濃厚、得未曾有、其中尤以二百米胸泳一項最有精彩、當報告員該項成績時、全塲歡呼之聲震動屋宇、蓋已以由凌崇舉産生全國新紀錄矣、茲附比賽情形如后、</p>
<p>（一）比賽槪評</p>
<p>男女五十米自由式　秩序單上第一項節目、即爲五十米自比賽、起始直至終點尹衍鈞與練顯南、互爭第一、相併而游、最後終點尹陳二人、相距不過寸許、然卒由尹衍鈞占先、</p>
<p>二百米胸泳　爲昨晚節目中最有精彩之一帶、五名水花四濺、只見五隻人蛙、鼓勇前進、在一百五十米光景、頭二兩名相離不及三米之遠、迨至終點時、凌崇學已超過余榮基二十五米有奇、且凌君姿勢完美、竟造成全國新紀錄、誠慶事也</p>
<p>女百米胸泳　由龔希芨女士唱獨脚戲、實比賽中别開生面者、</p>
<p>花式躍水　以余榮基及周玄光兩君爲最佳、一躍一跳、花樣百出、看來煞是有趣、比賽結果、余君較周君多獲一分、</p>
<p>一千五百米自由式　此項比賽、至米後二十五米轉灣時、頭二名同時前外推出、競爭異常劇烈、結果林潮源居首、陳玉波次之、達到終點之際、兩人相距不過五吋耳、</p>
<p>百米自由式　練顯南與尹衍鈞互相進逐、并駕而進尹君、至末了一躺中、始行追過綀君、雖善於利用轉灣、然卒被最後數秒間尹君之餘氣所擊敗、</p>

<h3>後浪催前浪東大選手近年滄桑記</h3>
<p>（瀋陽通信）東北大學自當年十四届華北運動會後、一躍而爲國内田徑之盟主、三年來榮光燦爛、普照中華、歷次大小賽會皆曾以大憨殊之實力穩獲優勝、但在這期間、功臣名成身退、新進奮起突前、幾輩後浪僅前浪、於是全體局面頓又經過幾度滄桑矣、</p>
<p>短距離　當年華北之役、短途主將爲劉長春君、劉君現仍安居故位所憾者實力或不如前耳、其後東特滕瑞麟（曾獲華北初級百米及二百米第一）轉入、於是更現發達、記得曾有一次、劉君以十秒八獲第一、（平常小運動會）而滕則以十一秒一獲第二、亦可謂罕見矣、但其後至全運會時、滕因缺練習而澈底地大敗、劉亦因傷腿而退步、</p>
<p>十九年夏、滕退學、同時又轉來李悅周君、吕以係短跑健者、於是補滕之缺、於同年四省聯運會之役、百米亦僅以一步之差見敗於「飛將軍」、</p>
<p>但時事多變、吕亦於今年夏預料畢業而退學、據云現在天津軍界供職、正當此時、華北中級短途佼佼者吴景耀又以考入聞矣、吴君體資頗佳、將來當能頗有造就也、</p>
<p>中距離　至於是距離、早年本以姜雲龍王玄基等爲主、薛玉祥龐士榮等佐之、當時在華北會、王曾獲八百米冠軍、而姜雲龍陳鳳生及薛龐四人全包千五百米而博得四騎士之美名、曾幾何時、陳鳳生首先退學、龐繼之、亦於昨年退學矣、王玄基則全盛時代已過、後起者如王銘紳·于希渭·王紹業·馬德剛·張寳祥·劉古學等、皆遠超其前、於是王一落而爲四百米選手、再一落而爲二百米選手矣、薛玉祥則不幸於今年初患扁桃腺炎、休息約一季之久、暑期中又不幸患腿病、屢受病魔之垂顧、至今壯氣已消磨至盡矣</p>
<p>長距離　早年長距離主將爲姜雲龍、姜在華北獲一千五·五千·及一萬、三項第一、但萬米本非其所長、故當大連趙德新、（即趙銘三）來校後、姜乃退出萬米之首位而讓之（次年全運會中、趙乃大施其威力而使國人深深認識東北之「老趙」、然而不幸天竟忌才、當老趙志高意滿蒞滬待發（赴日本參加遠東）之期間、因參加十七英里馬拉松賽跑而受急病、於是眼觀他人動身赴會、而已則困於病中、凡二月有餘、及至病愈時已瘦弱如柴、此生不敢再作運動想矣、回首前塵則不啻一場雄夢也、</p>
<p>自趙下野後、東北一時有人才缺乏之虞以故當年四省聯軍會被東特劉古學所乘、然而不料當年冬季、劉古學亦翩然投入此物望所歸之東大學府矣、於是東大長途界乃復中興、至今又有張永銘後起者頗爲進步、預料不久之後、當能成爲名手、</p>
<p>跳欄　至於欄界無大變更、高欄仍爲蕭鼎華之拿手、但張齡佳不甘永居下風、最近已有火拚之勢、又低欄已改爲中欄、於是近來乃願有不少投機者致力於此項、</p>
<p>跳躍　早年跳躍界素推蕭鼎華爲首、故又有草上飛之號焉、但當華北會後、大連轉來傳寳瑞、此君身高體偉、三種跳（跳高·跳遠·三級跳）皆其所長、現除三級跳外、前兩種還被學包辦矣、</p>
<p>投擲　在投擲界、華北鐵球兩大將温久豐·樊廣武、一赴德國、一則半下野、（所謂半下野者、即放棄其選手權利而不幹但偶而高興亦願一試之）現在所試者僅一張齡佳矣、張本精於三鐵、（鐵球·鐵餅·標槍）但以右臂骨不幸折斷之故、乃放棄其頗有希望之標槍而不幹焉、至其心則仍頗響往也、張之鐵餅現在國内可稱有數人才、至其十項則更較優秀矣、</p>

<p>預開掉期幾呈平掉　昨十五日標金狀態迷惑、殊無把握、業中意向徬徨、求供紛異、終日共有八兩零廻顧、最後僅漲二錢、殆銀市㣲跌、初開略漲、惟多方忽有賣出、即行萎靡、至外匯鬆而復平、更由套頭及廣帮等買意不懈、遂稍趨高、惟時有進退、徘徊於七十一二兩之間、後市忽起風波、蓋業中已預開掉期、照章須至今天、（十六日）然交易所曾一度勸阻無效、而空方果然貼出、與上届適反、初爲二兩七錢、詎一般多頭皆肯掉出、爲恒興益豐永亨等是也、因之愈趨愈廉、幾將平掉、而大連帮空頭等所成交者頗屬不少、以致人心浮虚、當已打破七百五十兩關内、尤以賣者逾恒、猝跌至六十六兩有零、復因掉期又回高、須計一兩七八錢、乃　　上買者猶勁、頓呈高翔、復已穿出七十兩以上、總而在此掉期聲中、終有一番變化耶、</p>
<p>早間幾度變化　自早間十月份開盤略加五錢、爲七百七十三兩二、大條僅近期降零六二五、遠期勿更、銀價跌八分之一、私　小去十六分之三、美股亦跌一元餘至二元以外、繼後加至七十四兩四錢、無奈大户永亨永豐志豐永等售出、故難立足、遂降至七十兩零八錢、迨英金揭佈勿動、零户稍進、故加上數錢、爲七十一兩四五錢、但同太昌森昌永日昌等售出不忘、即行降至六十九兩五錢、内部英金平平、銀行吃十二月一三零六二五、十一月同價出入均可、俄而上海買遠期一二五、致金價盤旋於七十兩内外、至十點後恒興元茂永等前來買進、又以英金回好、正金等吸十二月零六二五、殆市價漸漲三兩餘、直至十一點零爲七十二兩九錢、以後永亨等仍售、略遜二兩光景、午刻爲七十一兩、但無過於變化、聞印滙　大三安那、遠期反小一安那至午收爲七十一兩四錢、揭價仍計七百九十兩零二錢、計撳廿兩内外、午刻十九兩左右、</p>
<p>後市織呈混沌　後市開盤七十一兩、因永亨又售出、遂爲六十九兩三、繼又加至七十兩零二錢三井吃有日金一兩六錢一分八七五、正金吃一月英金零六二五至一二五、嗣因掉期旣開做、價亦步低、且塲内各號都有售出、因之跌風頓起、至三點時卒爲六十六兩二踐、人心頗怖、　　　　　　　、　　後銀行直　十　英　零六二五、志豐永乾昌祥永豐　　　套　　來爭購、故一刹時跳上二兩、惟有一兩餘盤轉、至三點半後掉期復大、並　某銀行亦有納進、　至四點廿分漲爲七十三兩七錢、此時昌升永乾昌祥等買進居多、不意大連帮賢出不　、即退至二兩四五錢、迨四點卅分收盤爲七十二兩九錢、比前日只加二錢、收市後又抬至三兩半以上、乃物品及廣帮拖進、惟顧利等又出、即抑至三兩一錢、按終日最大七十四兩四錢、最小六十六兩二錢、計有八兩二錢差次、</p>
<p>現赤交易無多　物品早市七十三兩三錢、午收一兩、下午一兩、收市四兩、揭價計撳廿兩光景、以後十七兩前後、登賬十月七十一兩、本月份已了結清楚、補水六十八兩、下午七十兩、現貨赤條平平、計遜加七兩七五、交易無多、</p>

<h3>外匯無特殊榮辱</h3>
<p>昨日英美印銀市均報低落、日美匯兌則漲一分、計四九四○、殆滬市匯豐掛牌和前天午後改縮後無異、惟僅德匯加半元、則一百二十八馬克、香港加○六二五、計八十兩、至銀行内部、晨晚均平、惟其中略有盤旋、曾一度見鬆、迨結果價均與上日相同、乃全市徘徊於七百七十兩内外、掉期已預爲私開、果由空方貼出也、華商交易尙稱活動、計英金成交約共二十萬鎊、係金業中抛出也、銀行尙能納進、而套頭幾已軋平矣、故金價未能上升、又美金不過二三十萬元出納、至日金由大連帮等售與日商銀行一百餘萬元、殆市况並無特殊榮辱云、</p>

<h3>厘拆市恍惚迷難</h3>
<p>市塲槪况　昨日厘拆市况、緊鬆合度、升降輒㣲、形勢迷離恍惚、收解無甚瑣繫、至於外界情形、供求亦弱、商業上需要雖値此仲秋殷繫之候、然遠不逮往昔之旺盛、可見今年各處天災商貨需求、類都疏懈耳、查現在金融界營業範圍各爲審愼起見、大槪縮縛不　、故無甚驚人之事之可言焉、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分四厘六毫二忽半、午市爲七錢二分四厘七毫半與前日趨勢大致相彷、（銀拆）早市一錢三分、午市一錢二分、較前日改小一二分、銀行掛牌五分、劃頭加水七八分、</p>

<h3>證劵鹽稅漲達一元外</h3>
<p>一九善亦續漲一元其他　數角</p>
<p>昨債劵現貨仍寥落、全日祗開出三千元、期市大致仍頗佳、計上午開出一千零六十餘萬、後市約四百五十萬、合計一千五百十餘萬元、其中鹽稅仍最旺、統稅二○關佔額亦甚鉅、趨勢比前日續稍平和、各方乘低買進、各價較前續益堅挻、除於晨初開出頗疲滯外、以後盤旋步漲、結果較前日以鹽稅九月上漲最巨、計達一元六角、其十月期貨及一九善亦約漲一元、其他亦漲三四角左右不等、獨整六現貨比上週初跌下一元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市平庸局面</h3>
<p>紗市又平、以海外花紗狀况一味傾向上游、目形勢頗盛、致人心愈弱、然大量新　　者較爲缺乏、因底盤關係也、但四圍環境十分惡劣、、所以大户空頭依然不動、至於多頭方面、態度鎭靜故大勢尙不脫盤旋之局也、</p>

<h3>棉市重入疲途</h3>
<p>棉市晨平午跌、形勢較虚、實以外棉步跌不已、且有大量廉價美印棉各廠購進殊巨、人心愈慌、市况急轉直下、然本埠天氣惡化、棉田又遭損害故一般棉商、仍在多頭地位、世界棉情十分悲觀、至於投機者、抛空空額、仍安然不動云、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市天雨趨堅</h3>
<p>南市　各帮來源仍少、昨市又因天雨、復趨緊象、城鄕店銷揀鮮尙殷、行胃不健、客路尙佳、致厚粳薄稻市又昂二角、洋釐尖貨雖不多、客帮本街交易不暢、市居穩局、新粳貨仍零星、消化平常、大盤有二尺上落、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日來源二十餘號、河貨客户堅持、有非價漲不售之意、内地如常熟、宜興等價格、合滬超過六七角之數、客方血本關係、兼之天又大雨、交易雖不見旺、市形轉佳、價昂一二角、青角　稻到仍寥寥、去胃毫無、糯米平定、</p>
<h3>洋米價跌動銷</h3>
<p>台州米小一角···小絞米小二角</p>
<p>洋米到頭踴躍···國外電報亦小</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、一致下跌、因邇日到頭踴躍、國外報價亦小、洋行打出一號西貢十月份、祗六兩七錢、大約亦有覆准之望、且八月份定米早經絡繹到齊、九月份之定貨、亦將逐次到埠、據洋商消息、在此十天内、九月份定貨大半可以到申、共計有二十萬包以上、因此貨主與洋行兜售甚力、行情多自願貶小、價小後乃引起本街囤户過問、實銷亦以價格便宜而收實、市面反見活　、但小紋現貨小二角有零小紋九月份則小去一錢之鉅、台州米及紋　米各　　小角許、計售開小紋現貨五千包、價十三元至十二元七角半、又九月份二百噸價六兩二錢、敏黨米二百包、價十三元、台州米共二百多包、白米十二元八角至十二元二角、次十一元九角、又糙米十一元云</p>
<h3>麥市午後重疲</h3>
<p>昨日麥市開盤後、因洋麥電報報大二三角、散多與内地帮均有收進、近遠各月份均見上漲一二分、惟進户胃口有限、而行家與大多頭均欲趁大套出、市面又復不克振作、午後交易雖比上午爲多、但行情反見落下、收市價九月份小一分、十月份不動、十一月份小一分、十二月一月均無出入、二月份大一分、現麥到存兩有、廠胃仍呆、市面疲軟、昨日華豐廠應酬鎭江·揚州麥等千餘包、</p>
<h3>近期粉北帮套出</h3>
<p>昨日麵粉開市後、廠家未有抛售、實銷客户亦無問津、市面清淡異常、各盤交易均少、比前數月之旺盛、實有天　之　、惟上午開　　　　　報大三角左右、浮多與内地客户均有收　、内地客更注意遠期、故各月份市價均見上漲、　因　洋帮以該地實銷不振、紛紛套出近期、市園又被帶小、結局九月份小二厘半、十月份不動、十一月份小半分、十二月份小二厘半、一月份大七厘半、二月份大二釐半、</p>
<h3>武進秋繭有六分年歲</h3>
<p>繭身亦佳···繭價最高放至八十元</p>
<p>武進縣屬各市鄕、今歲農民大半補育秋蠶、飼蟻頗旺、收蟻後天時適宜、發育順利、惟在大眠中因秋雨連綿、氣候大寒、蠶蟻備受影響、發現白殭及軟化等病、損失十之三四、早蠶已上市、晚蠶亦可落繭、統扯有六分年歲、繭行開秤已四日、互相放價競收、繭身尙佳、繭價最高放至八十元、</p>

<p>一匪受傷擒住　盜等旣出門、成衣舖夥計在後狂呼捉强盜、警笛聲、呼喊聲、陸續而起、匪乃由愛而近路折北入河南路、又折入靶子路而逃、此時三匪已逸去無踪、祗一盜被捕追趕、此盜奔至鴻安里附近、逃入乾元米店暫避、後又向東逃上百頓路將手中所持之槍向捕開放、捕亦還擊、中其小腹、乃倒地成擒、</p>

<h3>綁匪殘酷抛肉票入浦江</h3>
<p>索詐二萬元未遂</p>
<p>八歲孩葬身魚腹</p>
<p>族長主謀手段辣</p>
<p>朱松林詳供原委</p>
<p>重慶路馬安里一百九十九號門牌寡婦姚顧氏之八歲子姚菊生、於本年七月七號、在安南路九十六號外祖母顧趙氏家門首、突被匪黨誘拐無踪、致函勒贖洋二萬元、業經報請靜安寺捕房、由華探目金養吾等拘獲是案匪犯浦東人朱松林·婦人陸王氏·等兩人、惟小孩姚菊生則仍未查明、解送第一特院訊押各情、已誌十一號本報、茲悉姚顧氏年祗二十有五、</p>
<p>已爲寡鵠孤鸞　膝下祇此一子、一旦被拐失踪、已屬惶急萬分、所幸正犯被逮、不難追踪援救、俾可骨肉完聚、豈料惡耗傳來、月缺難圓、母子竟不能覩面矣、蓋姚菊生自被拐後、匪黨因勒贖未遂、懷恨於心、竟將菊生</p>
<p>抛棄黄浦江中　葬身魚腹、姚顧氏聞信之下、悲痛幾絶、乃奔赴捕房要求嚴究、由承辦此案之金探目、向獲犯朱松林詰問同黨所在、由朱供出此案主使犯係</p>
<p>姚顧氏之族長　本地人姚諸生（即姚子生）、遂於前晨七時四十五分、由金探目往重慶路二百十號門牌將姚諸生拘獲、收押捕房、昨晨轉解第一特院刑二庭、由馮世德推事提訊、即據捕房律師王耀堂起而述明案情、謂現控被告姚諸生犯刑法三百七十三條、恐嚇罪、二百八十四條豫謀殺人罪、及懲治綁匪條例第二條、要求改期、因朱松林案係由吴廷琪推事承審、已定於十七號下午特别訊理、故請</p>
<p>改期併案解訊　云云、又據朱松林供稱、與被告姚諸生在漢口宜昌相識、此案亦係姚唆使、緣本年二月二十九號、余從浦東乘輪來滬、甫抵外灘登岸、即遇被告姚諸生、互談之下、即約於下午</p>
<p>在一樂天茶樓　再聚、届時與姚晤面後、詢悉余近來境况不佳、乃給余洋二元、并稱有事相商、遂談起彼族中有姚顧氏者、因丈夫亡故、恐有不端舉動、且將財産供給氏母家化用、欲余將氏勾引或拐去氏之小孩、庶可使氏無顏回至姚家、并告余姚顧氏每</p>
<p>星期六必歸寗　一次、氏母家住於安南路九十六號、有餘屋出租、汝可見機作事、余因手頭拮据、乃由姚給余數十元、由余向姚顧氏之母顧趙氏家租得後廂房兩間居住、嗣因見姚顧氏性情端莊、知書明理、</p>
<p>並無輕浮舉動　乃不忍陷害、且因欵已用馨、故住居月餘、即行他遷、後遇姚諸生、即以前情告之、但姚仍命余進行、故於七月七日將氏子菊生誘出、意欲挈往浦東暫寄、乃至外灘、雇乘舢板、詎船埠江心、偶一失手、致</p>
<p>菊生跌入江中　一時挽救無術、遂致漂流無踪、翌日、余將此事告知姚諸生、姚乃給余洋二十五元、不數日、欵又告盡、即書寫信函、欲向姚顧氏索得銀洋、另謀生計、不幸被捕等詞、詰之姚諸生供稱、七年前我在宜昌開店時、　遇楊森戰後、我乃逃往漢關暫避、其時朱松林則</p>
<p>在關上爲庖丁　遂與相識、嗣朱竊取物件、逃逸無踪、迄今從未與朱謀面、我并無唆使朱誘拐姚菊生之事、查姚顧氏與我爲同族、呼我爲公公、且氏家并非富有、何能作此昩良之事、實遭誣攀、並延余華龍律師代爲辯護、馮推事核供、諭姚押候改期十七號下午、與朱松林併案訊理、</p>

<h3>老吴的白話文</h3>
<p>一天我在弄堂中遇見老吴擺着一個山芋攤子，備，有馬，牛，羊，雞，犬，猪六種竹籤代表六等獎品。我看見那個猪是字，疑他已經受了新文學的影響，却又見那犬字便疑他對於老文學還有眷戀之情。我因好奇心便問他改「豕」不改「犬」之緣故，才知道他是一位具有代表性的不澈底之文學改良家。這是我送老吴的一首遊戲詩··</p>
<p>「老吴賣山芋，</p>
<p>抽籤定贏輸。</p>
<p>籤分「馬」，「牛」，「羊」，</p>
<p>又有「雞」，「犬」，「猪，。</p>
<p>勸將「犬」改狗，</p>
<p>他說要依書。</p>
<p>我說書中「豕」，</p>
<p>不是你的「猪」。</p>
<p>好像小脚婆，</p>
<p>想做大脚姑。</p>

<h3>南通之倭子墳</h3>
<p>— 印瘦曼</p>
<p>明季。中原多故。倭人乘隙侵犯。江浙濱海之區。屢被蹂躪。擄刦㚥淫。無所不爲。人民受其禍累。可謂深矣。一日。有倭人五百餘。侵至南通南郊。官軍畏其勢。不敢與抗。惟閉城待援而已。時有麵司曹鼎者。工技擊。勇猛異常。睹狀大憤。慨然曰。堂堂大明臣民。乃甘心受辱。尙有面目見祖宗於地下乎。乃集里中精壯百餘人。編爲部隊。曉以大義。衆咸感動。誓共生死。曹乃取麫刀縛於棍端。以爲兵器。牽磨麵之馬以爲騎佈置旣畢。遂跨馬横刀。率隊直入敵陣。敵猝不及防。疑爲飛將軍從天而降。驚慌自亂。城内官軍應之。聲勢益盛。殲敵大半。餘皆狼狽而遁。曹追至三十里。（地名）天忽大雨。馬陷泥坎中不能起遂遇害。里人感其義勇。建祠立像於狼山之麓。以爲紀念。並瘞倭屍於祠北。即今之倭子墳也。高四丈計。廣約四畝。先賢張季直先生特築亭於其上以爲游人休息之所。顏曰京觀。蓋取積尸封土以表戰功之意也民十一年。有日本海軍官佐十餘人。到通遊覽。見此遺蹟。以爲有損國體。欲遷其殘骸回國。經地方人士婉拒之。始怏怏而去。</p>
<h3>江亢虎不忘祖國</h3>
<p>— 許晚成</p>
<p>月之十二日午。偕黄警頑氏訪問新由美返之江亢虎博士。談話頗久。江氏離國五年。此次返國。爲期未逾一月。又將西去。蓋純係觀光祖國。歡叙親朋也。</p>
<p>江氏在美。任美京國會圖書館名譽顧問。阿列根省立大學特别講座。坎拿大默紀大學主任敎授等職。訂「終身制」。至華人在美任大學主任敎授。實江氏一人而已。江氏最近撰英文「中國文化綱要。」譯「唐詩三百首。」在美之紐約出版。</p>
<p>江氏自謂。「余（江自稱下倣此」在美生活舒適。有樂不思蜀之槪。但風聞祖國天災人禍。相逼而來。思之黯然。余亦係中華國民之一份子。逍遙海外。念同胞困苦流離。心有所不忍。再留美幾年。决擬返國。致力學術。作刻苦生活。與同胞共嘗艱苦。」觀於此。可知江氏實不忘祖國也。</p>
<p>江氏前曾覲見宣統廢帝。此次返國。又承蔣主席之召。十三日晚偕中委褚民誼氏晉京。與蔣主席談話。自謂「胸懷純潔。不含任何作用」云。</p>
<h3>蓉湖新語</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>街道滄桑　無錫城區。地勢較代。故當大水來時。城内外濱河街道。盡入水中。汪洋一片。無復分界。市井有滄桑之觀焉。市民爲維持交通計。到處架置長條木板。如鐵道之雙軌然。負販者往來其上。望之若龍宫海市也。迄今水退之區。而行路尙難者。因錫地街道。除幾條馬路外。　屬磚砌。浸水多日。遂生變化。或突或陷。地平綫早經破壞。如蜀道崎嶇。有行不得之歎焉。市民有函請當局。速爲修復者。誠爲市政要務。否則陵谷變遷。眼前事耳。</p>
<p>灘簧世界　錫地自湖山風景外。殊尠娱樂塲所。雖有幾處黎園。而時作時輟。今且絶滅已。及京劇一變而爲電影。於是有中南無錫兩大院應時以起。而邑人視綫。羣集銀幕上矣。乃最近又一變而爲灘簧。自中東一家首倡。日夜滿座。遂羣視爲投機事業由是第一台也。新民也。大華也。風起雲湧。莫不利市三倍。所演如珍珠塔。如雙珠鳳。如玉蜻蜓。如梁山伯。如刁南樓等。海報通衢。隨在可見。班名且不曰灘簧。而曰南方歌劇。舉凡鑼鼓服裝佈景。悉同臉譜舊劇。惟唱工道白。仍是灘簧。實此調之别開生面者耳。其詞粗鄙近俚。其情纏綿悱惻。足當哀感頑艶四字。尤爲婦女所歡迎。廻腸盪氣。刻骨銷魂。雖風雨不能間斷也。故西門有某氏女。小姑居處。今尙無郎。以碧玉之妙年。感黄河之艶曲。目迷心醉。竟發狂疾。報紙宣傳。騰笑隣里。是可見灘簧之魔力也。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>倫敦的女警察歐美幾個大都會中。對於警政十分注重。一切設施。異常完備。除男警察外。并有女警察。不過爲數還不多。以英京倫敦一處而言。在　千九百二十五年以前即開始招僱女警察計得二十四名。分配服務。很有成績。不久就增添至五十名。現在已有一百名了</p>
<p>私家動物院　倫敦有一處馬奶房中。有一個養馬的人。性情和易。喜與禽獸爲伍。歸他豢養而看守的。除有馬一百匹外。有兩頭印度的猴子。一頭已經馴服了的野兎。又有一頭牝狐。他常常帶着在倫敦城中游行。好似人家帶着愛狗散步一般。此外更有許多兎·鴿·金絲雀·與外國的異鳥等等。鎭日的鳥鳴獸呌。甚是熱鬧。這一個所在。倒好似一所私家的動物院。（海客）</p>
<h3>記潛水絶技</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>世界錦標潛水家法人麥脫監氏。刻已來滬。將在嘉年華會表演其驚人絶技。届時滬人又得一飽眼福矣。大陸報曾載有監氏小史及其絶技。茲節譯如次。</p>
<p>監氏之父原爲一運動家。尤精游泳。故監氏兩歲時常爲渠父携之游泳池中。耳濡目染久之。即引起游泳興趣。而有今日之榮譽也。渠第一次作潛水之試騐。其高度約自七呎至九呎左右處躍下。嗣後雖日見增加。然其他高度倍之者不尠。中心每爲之下懌。遂益努力。至今日已能由一百零五呎高度潛入深可五呎之水中。而握世界覇權焉。渠之成名。乃在墨西哥公開表演時。戰勝著名潛水家始。絲後復敗數潛水家。名遂益噪。同時以生活艱難。乃變爲職業潛水家。據渠云。「余以此游戲爲職業者已三十四年。在過去十年中。輒思中止此種職業。而余妻殊不謂然。云余精力未衰。尙有繼續十年之可能性。果爾。則余年將六十有七。以白髮老翁。與一般黄口孺子較一日之短長。不禁啞然失笑。」潛水有時實危險殊甚。故監氏自一百三十六呎高之橋上潛入水中。嘗傷其左臂。時方年少。不以爲意。第二日仍繼續行之。於是臂傷益重。且復傷及額。臥於醫院中。月餘方痊。其他意外。更僕難數。</p>
<p>監氏有一驚人絶技。乃自一百零五呎高之梯端。作海鳥潛水之狀。雙足甫離梯。疾如鷹隼。迨至中央。翻一筋斗。乃復作險狀潛入水中。此技屢在西班牙·英·美·法等國表演。嘗博得好譽。電影武俠明星范朋克尤稱贊不置。餘如緩行潛水。亦監氏絶技之一。身輕如葉。飄飄而下。形似紙鳶。姿勢絶美。然較諸急行潛水爲難。乃輕飄下墜。艱於保持其身體之平衡及重心。而有與池邊或水底互撞之虞也。監氏云。「自極高度潛入水中。乃下降時。身臨空中。耳鼓常爲空氣所擊。故余耳病重聽。乏術診治」云。</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>白蛉</p>
<p>南中昆虫草木之毒。所在多有。故昌黎有下牀畏藥之句。北都氣候素寒。宜無此患。然盛夏之中。亦有一二可虞者焉。曰守宫曰蝎爲尤毒。其狀鉗爪鉤尾。尾合毒汁。以尾螫人。痛不可耐。古文萬字。即象其形。後加虫爲蠆。其實一也。已已夏間。假居燕京大學王敎授庽齋。晝寢聞枕畔悉索有聲。未之異也。抵夜展衾。則一蝎赫然在焉。恐怖幾不復能寢。此室中有紗　掃除至潔。而猶不能免。他處可想。故凡居北土者。如不張幬。則宜移床室之中央。勿近牆壁。然此物螫人不能至死。近代生物學家早已論定。不足憂也。其人力所不得施者。惟白蛉耳。白蛤體纖而色白。飛集人膚。幾於目不能覩。初來之客。受其　嘬最烈。次年則抵抗力漸增。久居漸不復畏。然血血液易受反應者。或終身不能免焉。協和醫院精研此證。卒不獲治療之方近始發現西山臥佛寺爲白蛉孽生之源。謂春厬之交以石灰墁溪　。可冀絶其根株。他日市政進步。穢惡盡除。人力亦未嘗不可勝天也。</p>
<p>大夫</p>
<p>北語醫生曰大夫。而讀大若代。南人每以爲異。然此音甚確也。大本在泰韻。古音固當讀代。今通行讀達字去聲者。乃受吴語之影響也。凡吴語皆讀泰韻之字爲禡韻。不知以何因緣。北人獨采此吴語。而於專用名詞之大夫則仍讀正音。地名亦然。大同大名。皆讀代同代名。淺人不知。以榪爲正。以泰爲訛。遂搖首瞠目。不得其解矣。醫生稱大夫。或亦舉爲怪異。殊不知古代官名尊稱。久而習俗用爲相敬者。不止一個。薙匠之爲待詔。茶役之爲博士。當舖火計之爲朝奉。皆是也。推而言之。相公爲唐人尊宰相之稱。明以後以呼秀才。此預祝也。員外爲唐宋較濫之散官。幾於盡人可得。鄕里富豪遂亦冒此榮稱。故小說中稱土豪必曰員外。此濫施也。至於醫生之稱大夫。抑有說。古代以醫爲業者。必通箱官府。金瓶梅石頭記記延醫事。輒云請某太醫。其始也醫生皆爲大夫。繼則槪以大夫稱醫生。與南中稱醫生曰郎中者一也。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>丈夫的妻子（十四）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>他的目的，與希望，一步步的增加與進展，最初的自然是限於精神方面的慰藉，已十分滿足，因爲對方的防閑鬆弛，他的想像，便逐漸地趨向到肉慾方面。陳夫人本來没有確定的意志，在戀愛李先生，伊只追求些虚誇而似乎舒適生活上的個人享樂觀，伊只感覺到陳先生是一個拘謹的道學者，不會享樂，不會消遣，尤其是不會賺多量的金錢供給伊使用，所以對於這麽一個年輕的丈夫，是不能滿意。伊和李先生的厮混在一起，不過是一種交際，並且認爲是普通的交際，伊因爲男朋友不多，想在李先生方面，化出去，再多認識幾個男朋友。伊自已也不預備戀愛李先生，並且也料不到竟被李先生得寸進尺的策略所征服了。</p>
<p>有一天，是星期日，陳先生照例不出大門的，他以爲夫人一定很忙，要和朋友們去玩的，他在隔夜，已託李夫人買了不少的菜，舒舒服服地在家裏吃一餐的，誰知他夫人偏不出去，睡到中午十二點鐘，還没有起身。在平時，屋子裏的收拾，陳夫人走了出去，都是李夫人得整理的，今天李夫人爲避嫌疑起見，便不進來了。地上滿布了瓜子殻，和牛奶糖的包皮紙，床前烟碟子裏盛滿香烟頭，陳夫人從被窩裏探出一隻手，慒慒懂懂的在香烟罐裏抓了一枝烟，擦了火儘自的吸個不已。陳先生眞是坐立不安，他不敢催促夫人起床，只在地中踱着，誰知脚氏上又踏着橡皮糖渣滓，黏住了。</p>
<p>「倒霉！」他自言自語的在憤怒。</p>
<p>「誰把霉給你碰了去。」陳夫人閉着眼，在床上接口。</p>
<p>「你可以起身了，李家中飯都用過啦，你起了身，屋子也可以打掃打掃，橡皮糖踏了滿脚呢。」</p>
<p>「你知道我是什麽時候回來，什麽時候合眼？」</p>
<p>「那麽現在你醒了。」</p>
<p>「不許養一會神麽？」伊把烟頭向地下一丢，又蒙着被睡了。陳先生嘆了一口氣，　見地下的香烟還有大半枝没吸，便拾了起來，弄熄了　在烟碟子上面。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>中國第一輛自造車</h3>
<p>現陳列於路市展覽大會内</p>
<p>中國第一輛汽車。即遼寗迨擊砲廠廠長李宜春氏所創製之民生載重汽車也。民生工廠。即附設於迫擊砲廠内。經張副司令特别贊許。並撥巨欵。按該項載重汽車。載重二噸。最適於中國現代道路之用。體積之大小。與一般輸入載重二噸之車相彷。關於製造方法。則除發動機電器表裝置及輪帶等數部。暫採用專門製品外。其餘各件。均自行設計製造。及耐用及堅固程度。較諸一般載重車。特别優良。而其價値。則反較低廉。茲將其特點。摘錄如左。</p>
<p>水箱分爲四部　普通車轍。水箱均祇一具。一遇損壞。即不能行動。而民生載重汽車。則分爲四部。如遇某一部份損壞時。仍可行動如常。即須修理。其所費自較低廉。</p>
<p>彈弓堅固　前後彈弓。均爲半橢圓形。用鉻釩鋼製造。兩端軸孔。均附有特種青銅軸套。視其厚度。亦較其他車輛厚四分之一。則其堅强有力。自屬勝人。</p>
<p>可以搖擺　該項汽車。設遇泥地低處。輪胎傾入泥地時。可以使車身搖擺。車身立時可以行出泥地。</p>
<p>爬山獨一　如遇山坡。或高處。在二十五度或三十五度時。該車行駛。絶不受影響。如履平地。且即於山坡中間停頓瞬息。仍可鼓力前進。决無傾瀉退後之虞。</p>
<p>依上所述。吾儕正深足慶幸中國竟有此一鳴驚人之工業非常出品。以後該廠之努力與進步。自可造福全國工商。挽回無數外溢之利權。日來適逢路市展覽大會在滬開幕。該廠特租定七十一號陳列室。陳列民生載重汽車以資介紹。而使國人有相當認識。下圖即該車式樣。</p>
<h3>六大特色之順風牌新車</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>具有自然浮動力與自由吃排　哄動整個最低價汽車界</p>
<p>具有自然浮動力與自由吃排之順風牌新車。自經克雷斯勒君宣佈於世後。到處喧傳。聲譽鵲起。本埠馬迪汽車公司。茲已運到大批。特將各種式樣。於月之十二日星期六日起。公開陳列。藉供海上汽車界人士之賞鑑。</p>
<p>新車價格最爲低廉。車身式樣計共八種·悉以鋼絲車輪爲其標準裝置。八種式樣維何。蓋即跑車。轎跑車。運動跑車。運動轎車。附設後座轎跑車。兩用轎跑車。以及雙門。及四門轎車是也。四汽缸順風牌新車之種種特色。不勝枚舉。其最著者。厥爲特别革新之原動力機器架盤。蓋即順風牌工程師所謂自然浮動力者是也。惟其有此特色。是以原動方機器全部。得自然浮動於其天然軸上。</p>
<p>克雷斯勒與順風牌汽車公司工程師。僉以爲自然浮動力之貢獻於汽車搆製者。洵至顯著而最有價値。蓋除自動出發機。四輪塞車。及鋼質車等。三大發明外。當以此爲汽車工程方面之第四大成功。歷經長時間之測騐與試乘。在在確切證明自然浮動力之功用。在能確爲四缸汽車闢一新紀元。四缸引擎之顫震。旣因而驅除凈盡。四缸汽車之經濟。與八缸汽車之穩定。且因而合而爲一。斯蓋得未曾有者。洵難能可貴已。</p>
<p>在昔汽車工程專家。對於四缸引擎之顫震與簡陋。因皆殫思竭慮以謀所以避免之道。及至汽缸只數加多。汽車業乃皆致力於六缸八缸等之研究與改良。而不復措意於四缸引擎。惟順風牌工程師。則仍努力從事。終始不懈。以冀造成盡美盡善之四缸車以應世焉。誠以彼輩心目中。因認定四缸式爲各種煤氣引擎中之最經濟·最簡便。抑且最切於實用者。且深知其堅强精優。彌經久用。管理便易。使用費省。速率高超。操縱自如。與夫山嶺沙漠。無往不宜等優點。較諸同樣機力效能之任何車輛。正相伯仲。初無二致。故除顫震之唯一缺點外。四缸車誠不愧爲最低價車輛之最完善者。</p>
<p>然而四缸車之顫震。今亦不足憂矣。蓋自克雷斯勒公司工程部副主任山德氏首先創製之自然浮力克告成功。於是引擎顫震之唯一缺點。因原動力機全部浮動於底盤内。乃得由車身車架散除無餘。按引擎震撼之避免。與橡皮吸受性。實有莫大關係。順風牌工程師發明成功之浮動力。蓋即利用橡皮新裝置。如引擎橡皮架盤。裝用兩個。以代尋常之裝用三個或四個是也。惟此兩個架盤之裝置。地位恰得其宜。適合科學原理。故能使浮動力成此得未曾有之偉大效能。後部橡皮架盤。裝於傳力機後方横檔内。前部架盤。則恰裝於水邦浦下。而以附於前横檔之特製三角弧承載之。至接連此前後兩架盤之線。自必經過原動力機之重心點。於是原動力機之全部。賴以獲得絶對平均之支持。再爲保持引擎之相當直線。曁使其動作適在橡皮架盤所容許之範圍内起見·</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>轉以製就之肱木彈簧。置於引　後部與車架邊檔間。彈簧之一端。緊繫於引擎。其又一端則嵌入車架邊檔中橡皮内。順風牌新車之引擎架盤·似此特殊裝置。宜其乘駛靜穩·逈非尋常四缸車所可同日而語·至因快慢率突然加減而發生之一切震撼。爲其完全吸收。不復存在。尤爲至顯著之事實。蓋以順風牌新車。歷經種種試騐。如於九·七秒鐘内。由開始出動疾駛至每小時四十英里之速率。與每小時疾行六十五英里至七十英里等。固皆足以證明其絶無顫震也。尤足述者。當迭次舉行暗中測騐時。即以順風牌新車雜於各種車輛内。而以其汽缸只數。詢數汽車專家。然而一般專家固皆莫辨其究係四缸六缸或八缸也。</p>
<p>自由吃排除浮動力外。順風牌之又一特色。厥爲自由吃排。斯乃順風牌工程師之特有傑作。其搆製逈異於其餘一般自由吃排。蓋其使用也。係以表板上所裝　鈕管理之。祗須將此管理鈕推進或推出。則車之是否自由吃排。即可隨心所欲。如願以償。順風牌新車扎以駕駛彌極便易。且極經濟合算者。蓋即由於此也。</p>
<p>傳力便易。乃順風牌新車之又一特色。惟其有此特色。故無論車行速率若何。選輪之傳動。胥極靈便安靜之至。至於每小時速率達五十英里時。即不用自由吃排亦能使其由高檔傳至二檔。或巔倒行之。咸極便易而安靜。</p>
<p>安全鋼身。絶對安全之鋼質車身。乃順風牌新車之標準裝置。爲順風牌工程師所首先創製者。製以超等鋼料。完全電氣夐合。天衣無縫。堅强無比。旣無木質接筍。自不致有鬆寬腐蝕燃燒等弊。且自能勝任重儎。再以車身與底盤架間。隔以絶緣物。故絶無使人不快之磨擦聲。</p>
<p>雙落車架　雙落式車架。乃順風牌新車之又一安全特色。特别低落。異常安穩。極便管理。全車重心。因以特别低降。而轎式車輛之全部高度。且因而節減至六十七寸。但其内部寬敞程度。則絶不蒙何影響。再不僅彌臻安全已也。新車式欵。且因而倍極漂亮。異常美觀。</p>
<p>内向水壓塞車　順風牌新車。乃具有自動均衡内向水壓塞車之唯一最低價車輛。簡潔無比。異常合算。旣無潤滑之煩。且無接筍鬆落。槓桿震碎。及纜索伸縮之虞。保護嚴密。雨雪不侵。至其動作靈敏準正而可靠。則尤出色當行。不可冀及。</p>
<p>上述六大特色。其餘係何種車輛。蓋未有能兼之者。惟順風牌新車。除兼而有之外。且復具有其餘種種優點。如線紋之美麗。色彩之和諧。設備裝璜之精緻。新式水箱及水箱帽之壯觀。以爲關於機械工程方面一切鉅細部份之無不精優卓絶等。不一而足。更僕難數。順風牌新車。所以盡美盡善。哄動整個最低價汽車界者。蓋即由於此也。</p>
<h3>參觀路市展覽會後</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>鼓起國人築路興趣　減少築路種種阻礙　自製汽車獨樹先聲</p>
<p>轟轟烈烈的全國路市展覽會。已在萬衆歡呼聲中揭幕了。這次規模雖不十分大。然而就大槪而論。能在短時期的籌備内。將全國道路狀况蒐集展覽。成績已屬不弱我覺得這次展覽會雖爲日無多。可是給予國人的印象。却異常深切。築路運動。在美國早已風起雲湧。而在我國。還以此爲破題兒第一遭。自然是一件値得欣慶的事。</p>
<p>近十年來。各地天災人禍。接踵而至。最近水災蔓延十餘省。哀鴻遍野。慘不忍覩。自然哪。天災不是人力可以挽救的。然而倘使全國有了很好的汽車路。那麽。甲地水災。乙地立刻可以利用汽車前去救濟。輸轉糧食。朝發夕至。一方面災區民衆。也可以立即輸送到安全地帶去。中國一遇災荒。便束手無策。眼見民衆垂斃。却無法救濟。也無非因爲缺乏道路的關係。所以從救濟災荒說。道路亟宜興築。這是第一點。天災之外。尙有人禍。近年匪徒潛伏。四出騷擾。利用交通不便。官兵無可如何。進勦困難。匪勢愈益披猖。如果全國各地有很好的道路脈絡貫通。自然匪禍可以不攻自戢。這是第二點近年來「到邊疆去」的聲浪很高。因爲内地人口過剩。生活爲難。邊疆地廣人稀。易於謀生。所以大家希望分一部分的人民到邊疆去屯墾。可是屯墾不是空言所可做到的。現在我國邊疆的交通和内部可說是異常隔膜。到雲南去要假道安南。方可迅速。到新疆去要幾十天。近來赤俄造三條鐵路接到新疆附近由莫斯科去。祇消八天。因之大家雖願意前往、却無路可走。所謂邊疆富源。祇好任人攘奪。假使有很好的道路。那麽。汽車直達。便利萬分。人民自然樂於前去。不待鼓勵而屯墾的功效可收。這是第三點。和屯懇邊疆有關的。尙有鞏固國防。中國政府和邊疆交通不便。在政治方面。便有鞭長莫及之勢。那些膏腴沃壤。惟有聽人宰割。試看各國歷史。亡人國者。多從交通方面先下手德國是軍國民主義國家。歐戰前。它早已在邊境佈置好了鐵路陣綫。後來戰端一開。德國軍隊。在東綫不甚緊張時。便移往西綫。西綫弛緩時。又回到東綫。來來去去。便捷萬分。所以一隊人馬可作兩隊用。交通在軍事上的價値。不難想見。如今中國外侮交逼。邊疆門户。更不宜洞開。鐵路即難興築。對道路却萬不容緩。這是第四點。中國人民的智識。祗有在通都大埠發達些内地還多半十分痼蔽。這自然也是交通不便的影響。因爲交通不便人民便很難往來。枯守一隅。文化不能灌輸。智識也無由發展。要在訓政時期辦自治。必須有健金的公民敎育。如此看來。道路自屬萬分重要。這是第五點。所以從上面五點看來。中國對於道路的需要。已可謂萬分迫切。道路協會在這時舉行路市展覽。實在是給民衆的唯一興奮劑。（未完）</p>
<p>消息</p>
<h3>桐渝路線選定（續）</h3>
<p>— 山浪</p>
<p>（三）與夜郎壩一綫之比較　此綫仍由鷹嘴巖經水口壩芶子門上台壩夜郎側面之二屯巖梅埡劍頭埡出鹽巖。再經川境之小九盤達趕水。路綫較新松綫略長。而地勢起伏。鮮有平坦路綫。如芶子門梅埡劍頭埡等處。坡度甚高。曲折尤大。且沿途市鎭稀少。僅有夜郎一處。又以地勢底下。不能經過場内。僅由側面半山之二屯巖經過。故此綫經過地帶。不獨路綫不良。工程較大。而沿途荒凉。無一繁盛市塲。較之新松路綫。遜色多矣。</p>
<p>（四）與揚村溝及新松沿河一線之比較　此線係由麻柳經楊村陸村暗河花秋擋達新站。再順新松河道。經兩河口釣魚洞而達趕水新站上段路線。位於石牛欄大坡後面之二層山谷中。雖多熟士。然㘭蕩疊出。傾斜過大。路位放低則之拐偏地。提高則盡屬露巖。且暗河一處。遇洪暴漲。即淹没山谷成斷絶地。不能通行。花秋擋一地。位與新站平行。山高八百餘米。暢折而下。非三十里之電光形路線不能到達山麓。且半屬巖山。工程甚巨。較之第一線加長二十餘里。故此段路線。亦無採取之可能自新站以下。順河而出。經松坎兩河口釣魚洞以達趕水一段、路線雖平坦。絶　夾立。層巖對崎之處甚多。如蒙渡至城隍廟一段。内有數處均係絶　。兩河口至釣魚洞二十里。純係懸巖夾崎。鐵路通過。尙感困難。馬路通行。更屬不易。實不如第一線之易於修築。故此上下兩段。均無採用之可能、</p>
<p>（五）新松線局部分之比較線　（一）銅鼓圓一線　此線係凉風埡至山坡間之一比較線由凉風埡直下順溝。經銅鼓圓河堵達山坡。路線本較直捷。惟凉風埡直下溝邊一段。電光之形不下十餘道。曲折過多。路線不良。河堵上下兩端。沿途大巖。又係臨河。鑿岩築堤。工程頗巨。不如花秋坪一線路線之平而省工也。（二）石牛欄一線　此線亦楚米鋪至山坡之間另一比較綫。由楚米舖順原有大道鴉鵲窩祖師觀石牛欄至悶頭箐。再由此順半山老長斜下。經瓦窰坪而達山坡。長約四十餘里。全段路綫。巖山居其大半。又多懸巖深谷。修築尤屬困難。且祖師　鴉鵲窩一帶。斜谷傾斜稍大。路綫由此。非多數電光形。不能通過。故此綫不獨工程浩大。而路綫亦實不良。遠不及對面花秋坪一帶土崗之平坦省工也。（三）王家墳一綫</p>
<p>此綫係七陣溪至桑園壩之一比較綫。由七陣溪斜上。經荷花坪而至王家墳。又斜下而達桑園壩。此綫係欲避免城隍寺數十丈之大岩而選出者。全段雖多土質。亦間有巖山。自王家墳以下。則全係巖石。總合計之。此段之巖堤工作。幾與城隍寺之巖堤工程相等。且七陣溪與王家墳上下兩段。均需利用電光形。實不如由城隍寺之順河而行。鑿巖而過之平坦而直捷也。蓋城隍寺巖石雖大。長不過八十餘丈。其下半段河面寬。而水綫即春夏洪水亦高不過丈餘。此半段路基。可完全由河内築堤　出。無　鑿巖。僅上半段因巖　立。而路位較高。河底深而冲力大。築堤困難。不能不完全鑿成。然巖長不過四十餘丈。所費亦不過數千元。再三斟酌。實較荷花坪王家墳一綫爲優。不能因區區困難。而犧牲此良好路線也　（四）歇馬台一線　此線係松坎至酒店埡之比較線。自松口場口順左側山農斜上經農灣歇馬台田壩山王廟而達酒店埡。長三十里。較由巴抓溪一線長十餘里。露巖雖少。似易工作。然除地表數寸後。土質内外部仍係巖石。合計此三十里之岩堤工作。比巴抓溪之數里露岩工作。只有過之無不及者。且歇馬台之田壩一段。切係夾谷。傾斜過大。電光形路線。亦不下十餘道。實不如巴抓溪一線之直捷省工而路線曲折較少也。故初次履勘。擬用歇馬台一線。後經詳細之審查。仍以巴抓溪一線較佳。蓋巴抓溪一綫。係松坎到川之　一良好馬路綫。雖　巖稍大。費欵稍多。不過向内鑿一丈寬之巖。外築數尺之堤。即可將車道路基修成。此種巖山路綫。一成之後。即可减少補修工作。誠一勞永逸者也。</p>
<p>總上所述各路線。無論爲人民減少工程計。應由新松。政府爲節省經費計。亦應由新松即爲運輸便利計。爲沿途市鎭發展計。均應由新松。故本隊同人。不憚勞苦。踏徧崎嶇。歷盡險阻。經多數之比較。始克選出。雖不敢云良好之路線。然捨此以外。實無其他較優於此者。故此次新松路線之選定。渝方勘測同志。於會勘之後。均表示同情。放棄温水爲交點之主張。固非勘測者。對於選擇上有所偏私。或有所錯誤也。（完）</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Urges Xu to Persuade Yan to Leave Shanxi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It was reported a few days ago that Yan Xishan was assassinated in Shanxi, and now it is reported that Yan will come to Beiping. According to those familiar with the inside story, Yan's assassination was fabricated. Yan is reluctant to leave his hometown and is vague about the names and origins of the assassins. Yan used this as an excuse to refuse to see guests, so as to fulfill his wish to temporarily live in his hometown. Moreover, even Yan's close associates are not received unless they are summoned by telegram. There are troops at a certain place two hundred miles away who check and stop those who visit, so there is no way to assassinate him. The news of his coming to Beiping was released by his side in the hopes of easing the atmosphere. Zhang Xueliang asked Xu Yongchang several times about Yan's prolonged stay in Shanxi, but received no definite answer. He is scheduled to summon him again tonight to urge him again. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang said that the rumor that Yan Xishan will come to Beiping is absolutely unreliable. Yan does not want to leave Shanxi recently. Yan can guarantee that he is in Shanxi, but Yan cannot guarantee that he will leave Shanxi. Huang Luchu arrived in Beiping tonight. (Special telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang visited Zhang Xueliang tonight and talked for a long time. Zhang still urged Xu to persuade Yan to leave Shanxi. (Special telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Shanxi Provincial Government has repeatedly telegraphed to urge Xu Yongchang to return to Shanxi to preside over the financial chaos, and sent representatives to Beiping to urge him. Today, Xu replied to the provincial committees that the Beiping affairs are not yet completed and that he will temporarily postpone returning to Shanxi, but can travel before the Mid-Autumn Festival. (Special telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Tso-pin Going to Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Tso-pin left Beiping for Shenyang this morning. Ji Yiqiao, Wang Shuhan and other 30 people came to the station to see him off. Chiang told reporters: 1. Our side is investigating the Nakamura Incident. When there are results, I intend to negotiate on the spot to resolve it as soon as possible. 2. Tang Erhe has no mission in diplomacy and will not return to Shenyang for the time being. 3. I will stay in Shenyang for two days and then go to Korea to comfort the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese. Two days later, I will go to Japan to present my credentials and assume the post of ambassador. Deputy Commander Zhang hopes that the Nakamura Incident will be resolved quickly. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chiang Tso-pin passed through Tianjin at noon on the 15th on his way to Shenyang and then to Japan. According to his statement, our side has sent senior officials to investigate the Nakamura Incident and will determine the method after obtaining a report. After arriving in Japan, he will do his best to negotiate the Wanbao Mountain case and other cases in Korea. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Our Side is Investigating the Nakamura Incident</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Nakamura Incident. Our country's third investigation team arrived in the Xing'an area on the 9th and went to the Su'e Duke's Mansion for an on-site investigation, which was very thorough. It will return to Shenyang to report within a few days. Chen Xingya's team is a separate team. The suspect in this incident, Yan Yufang, acting head of the 3rd Regiment of the Reclamation Army, has been ordered by the authorities to be detained in Taonan and will arrive in Shenyang within two or three days. Once questioned, the truth will be revealed. As for the passport held by Nakamura, it was in the name of a Doctor of Agriculture studying history and geography, intending to spy on our country's defense secrets, which is sufficient grounds for protest. As for the Japanese request for future guarantees, it is heard that Japan is demanding that all Japanese in Manchuria and Mongolia have freedom of travel. Manchuria and Mongolia are bandit-ridden and not safe areas. This aspect is very important. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Xingya told people that the investigation of the truth of the Nakamura case should be based on fairness and impartiality, so as to achieve a satisfactory resolution. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The opinions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities here regarding the Nakamura case are not as serious as those proposed by the Japanese military authorities. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang has adopted an open and honest attitude towards the case and has said that if the fault lies with China, it should be admitted and corrected. The Japanese legation does not laugh at the rumors circulating outside that Japan will take severe action against China, saying that there have been many such cases in recent years and that the Nakamura case is just one more. The exaggeration of the newspapers is not worth taking seriously. (Reuters telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The prospect of Japan demonstrating its military might in Manchuria over the Nakamura Incident is becoming increasingly apparent. Although the cries of the military circles are still incessant, their true intention is mainly to oppose the reduction of military spending. However, according to those who are good at observing the situation, the situation is still extremely dangerous. Only because the leaders of the military and the press knew that the tense situation last week was about to escalate into an uncontrollable situation, they have extricated themselves from their predicament, so the crisis is not as serious as it was a few days ago. Minister of the Army Minami told reporters today that he believes that the Nakamura Incident should be resolved in accordance with public opinion and that the military will act in accordance with public opinion. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Japan's most powerful newspaper, also advocates peaceful action and avoiding rashness, so as not to allow the situation to deteriorate to an unmanageable point.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Responsibility</h3>
<p>The driving force of responsibility stems not only from the obligation of one's duty, but also from the innate emotions of one's conscience. Acting under the compulsion of duty, the moment difficulties arise in one's work, the heart of responsibility may well slacken due to fear. Acting under the compulsion of conscience, the more difficulties one encounters, the more one is willing to strive bravely. This is something that can be known without testing. The cruelty of this flood is such that I can assert that there are certainly no relief personnel who treat disaster relief as a means of profit, as was the case in the Qing Dynasty. If there are, they are definitely not human and certainly disregard this disaster relief effort. If there are those who treat disaster relief as an ordinary errand and consider perfunctoriness as fulfilling their duty, then the lives of many disaster victims will be neglected. They would be sinners against the entire Chinese nation. For the flood victims are in such dire need of help that there should be no delay, not even for a moment, and no waste of money or rice, not even a single cent or grain. All the donated or requested relief money and grain must be distributed to the disaster victims without the slightest bit of embezzlement. Furthermore, it must be done quickly and nimbly without any delay to be of real benefit to the victims. If one is only thinking of comfort, staying in large hotels, traveling in first-class carriages, and eating foreign food, they may think that they are fulfilling their duty to the victims and should receive this as compensation. But they do not know that they have indirectly saved dozens of lives less. Or if one is lazy and procrastinating, waiting for the morning court today, waiting for the day after tomorrow. If there is wind or rain, they will not go. If the boat or car is not comfortable, they will not go. If the area is dangerous, they dare not go immediately. With such procrastination, they may think that a day or two's delay is not a big deal. But they do not know that many disaster victims are already seeking sustenance from the belly of dried fish. If their enthusiasm for disaster relief truly comes from the compulsion of conscience, they will certainly be restless day and night and dare not have any thoughts of seeking comfort or fearing difficulties. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Those who are now responsible for flood control and disaster prevention, having countless lives buried due to a moment of negligence, must feel deep pain if they have any humanity. Yet they still stubbornly justify themselves, saying that such a massive disaster was unexpected and beyond human resistance. Even the capable could do nothing. Some defend them, saying that such a massive disaster has not occurred in a hundred years. The disaster prevention personnel lack experience, which is the reality. They do not know that lacking experience is merely temporary clumsiness. The root cause of this disaster is not in temporary clumsiness, but in the neglect and abandonment of normal times, forgetting their own responsibilities. Disaster prevention materials were used for other construction. Disaster prevention funds were used for other undertakings. Moreover, they constantly fought with the water for land, forcing the water to have no place to reside, resulting in breaches. The danger was foreseen long ago. Therefore, their negligence in duty is far beyond ordinary neglect, and there is no way to shirk responsibility. Today, they are subjected to public criticism and government punishment. If they reflect, they will have no words to defend themselves. Now that things have come to this, it is useless to blame the past. It is only hoped that the former responsible personnel, and those who will remain responsible in the future, will quickly arouse their conscience, reverse their previous actions, and try to make amends. Those who were not responsible in the past but will be responsible in the future should take this incident as a warning and strive to eliminate future troubles. Having experienced such a great lesson, everyone must be touched in their conscience. Therefore, it is acceptable not to bear the responsibility of disaster relief and prevention in the future. But if one intends to bear it and still acts as sloppily as before, can they still be called human?</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Passes Second Reading of Austerity Bill</h3>
<p>Snowden's Witty Remarks</p>
<p>Cause Misunderstanding Among the Opposition</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - The government's Austerity Bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons last night. The government, with a majority of 57 votes, defeated a motion to reject the bill put forward by several former Labour Cabinet members. The bill, proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald, is a special emergency measure that allows the government to quickly and effectively cut departmental spending without the delays of going through Parliament. The bill specifically stipulates that the government may implement austerity plans by means of Orders in Council within one month of the bill becoming law. The House of Commons debated the opposition's motion for a long time, until late at night. During Snowden's speech, there were constant roars and strange phenomena, caused by the opposition's misunderstanding of Snowden's remarks. Snowden recounted the meeting between Labour Cabinet members and Labour national officials on August 21, the eve of the Labour government's resignation. He said that the Labour government disclosed austerity proposals that Cabinet members had already agreed to on that day, but the national officials refused to accept them. This led to the change in the Labour government's organization. After the new government was formed, there was endless debate about the scope and nature of the austerity measures. In fact, the resigning Labour Cabinet members had already agreed to the austerity measures before the Labour government collapsed. When he announced the austerity measures to the Labour national officials, Henderson, the former Foreign Secretary and now the leader of the opposition, did not raise a single objection. This meant that Henderson had already acknowledged the austerity measures when he was a Cabinet member. He later discovered that the Labour national officials had secretly hidden a stenographer under the table to record the words spoken during the meeting. At this point in Snowden's speech, shouts erupted, and the Speaker had no choice but to ask both sides to be patient and not to hinder the proceedings of the debate. It turns out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement that the Labour officials hid a stenographer under the table was a witty remark. Henderson had previously said in the House of Commons that he could produce a shorthand record of the proceedings at that time, so he made this remark to satirize him. Unexpectedly, the opposition misunderstood, leading to the dispute. The new Home Secretary, Samuel, rose to conclude the debate, saying that it was inappropriate for former Labour Cabinet members to attack in September proposals that they could have approved in August. According to public speculation, Henderson and several comrades had actually changed their stance after the meeting with the national officials. British Prime Minister MacDonald met today with four male and one female representatives of the unemployed, who came from various parts of England and Wales, introduced by the Labour extremist Members of Parliament Kirkwood and Maxton. The Prime Minister listened quietly to the representatives' petitions for an hour before explaining to them the government's need to cut unemployment benefits and telling them that the unemployed would not suffer greater losses in the future.</p>
<h3>Federal Structure Committee Focuses on Gandhi</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The Federal Structure Committee reconvened this morning. Because Gandhi will speak today to present the All-India Congress's position, the general public is paying great attention. Reuters has learned that Gandhi went to the India Office to speak with the Secretary of State for India, Hoare, for a short time before going to St. James's Palace this morning. Today's committee meeting will feature speeches and opinions from new representatives. The representatives who have already spoken are mostly optimistic about the outcome of the Round Table Conference and expect the committee to begin considering actual proposals for an All-India Federal Constitution tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - The Federal Structure Committee, tasked with drafting the Indian Constitution, held a meeting today. Gandhi's initial participation attracted greater attention. Sunday is Gandhi's day of silence, so he only listened to others' opinions and did not speak himself. The committee generally discussed the matter, and a result is expected after Gandhi and others speak tomorrow. Afterwards, they will begin studying the detailed plans proposed by Chairman Lord Sankey, which are divided into the following four areas: (1) the power and organization of the Federal Parliament, including the proportion of seats held by the princely states and British India in both houses; (2) direct and indirect election methods; (3) the relationship between the two houses; (4) the distribution of financial resources between the central government and the provinces.</p>
<h3>Austrian Coup Suppressed</h3>
<p>Mastermind Puff Failed to Escape into Italy</p>
<p>Socialist Party is Powerful</p>
<p>Pan-Germanic Party Cannot Gain a Foothold</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 14th - According to recent news from Styria and elsewhere, the disturbances have been quelled. The party leaders have either been arrested or have fled. Dr. Puff, leader of the Pan-Germanic Party, is rumored to have fled to Italy, but his chief of staff, Dr. Land, has been captured. Steinhaus, the former Minister of Interior, has also been arrested because he is the commander-in-chief of the Pan-Germanic Party in Upper Austria. Vienna is the base of the Socialist Party, and the Pan-Germanic Party has no foothold here, so the coup failed. The capital city's control over the country is extraordinarily effective. The Vienna branch of the Pan-Germanic Party had 260 members, dressed in plain clothes, hiding weapons, and gathered in one place. But they were disarmed by soldiers today. Another group of party members, gathered somewhere between Vienna and Linz, was also captured by troops. This disturbance can be said to have been bloodless. Previous reports of hundreds of farmers being killed have now been denied by officials.</p>

<h3>Street Fight Between German Extremists</h3>
<p>Sixty-Five Seriously Injured</p>

<h3>Rumor of Joint Anglo-American Movement to Cease Warship Construction</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 14th - Today, the Associated Press received information from reliable sources that British politicians have repeatedly suggested that Britain and the United States jointly launch a movement to abolish battleships. The presentation of this proposal is related to Anglo-American cooperation in ensuring the success of the disarmament conference. The abolition of battleships was also an important issue at the 1930 London Naval Conference, but it failed to progress due to widespread opposition. Therefore, Britain has proposed it again today, hoping that it can be realized at the disarmament conference next spring. At present, the world is paying more and more attention to disarmament, and many believe that once the burden of world armaments is reduced, economic recovery can be expected to be faster. Therefore, Senator Borah has proposed a five-year suspension of warship construction. Foreign Minister Grandi also proposed at the League of Nations to suspend warship construction temporarily before the disarmament conference next spring. When U.S. Secretary of State Stimson traveled to Europe recently, he also had detailed discussions on disarmament. It is expected that Britain and the United States will definitely consult with each other frequently this winter, hoping to reach a consensus on the battleship issue first.</p>

<h3>Two Suspects Arrested in Budapest Train Bombing</h3>

The authorities have arrested two suspects, one posing as a railway engineer and the other a Budapest student.

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua et al. Telegram: To all newspaper offices: We have just read Commander-in-Chief Chiang's telegram, urging the cessation of internal warfare, the suppression of bandits, and disaster relief. His words were earnest and moving. At this critical moment of internal and external troubles, when survival is at stake, how should all citizens arouse their conscience and reverse the disastrous situation? Yet a few reactionary elements in Guangdong and Guangxi are gloating over the disaster, acting perversely, and are willing to sacrifice the Party and the nation to achieve their own ends. We are deeply angered by the frequent reports of alarms. In recent days, Vice Commander Zhang and other gentlemen have sent telegrams in response, strongly defending peace, with righteous words and deep admiration. We will inspire our officers and soldiers to follow his lead, with common hatred and unwavering commitment. We respectfully submit our sincere feelings, hoping for your understanding. Liu Zhenhua, Liu Maoen, Ruan Xun, Xu Pengyun, Wu Tinglin, Xing Qingzhong, Yang Tianmin, Liu Huixin, Yao Banchen, Ma Qizhen, respectfully and earnestly.</p>
<p>Yantai Telegram: To all newspaper offices and all elders and brothers across the country: This year's torrential rains have caused disasters, and floods have inundated the land. The disaster areas are almost all over the country, and the land is about to sink. Homes have been destroyed, and refugees fill the fields. We are deeply saddened by the suffering of the people. On the 8th of this month, we launched the Jiaodong All Sectors National Flood Disaster Relief Association in Yantai, sending telegrams to appeal on behalf of the disaster victims. However, the disaster-stricken people are crying out for food, and disaster relief is like fighting a fire. Without raising emergency funds, nothing can be accomplished. The National Government has issued a clear order that civil servants donate their salaries to help disaster relief, and there are already regulations. Friendly countries are enthusiastically providing assistance, showing particular compassion. We, Zhennian, are honored to serve in the military, and we have a deep connection with our compatriots. It is our responsibility to save the people, and we have no other choice. We should do our best to promote this initiative to facilitate progress. Now, the officers and soldiers of this division are willing to donate what they can from their August salaries, totaling 15,000 yuan, all for disaster relief. The finances of this division are very tight, and we are unable to take care of ourselves. However, compared to the helpless disaster victims, our situation seems better. Although a cup of water cannot put out a cartload of fire, we must make every effort to provide what little we can to help. We hope that kind-hearted people will rise up, generously contribute, and jointly relieve the disaster. We await your kind instruction. Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 21st Division of the Army; He Yisan, Deputy Commander; Han Xun, Chief of Staff; Zhao Zhenqi, Liang Lizhu, Zhang Luanji, and other brigade commanders, along with all officers and soldiers, respectfully.</p>

<h3>39th Session of the Executive Yuan's National Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>Allocate Funds to Relieve Distressed Overseas Chinese in Mexico</p>
<p>Draft Postal Law Submitted to the National Government</p>
<p>Appoint Liu Fu Concurrently as Civil Affairs Commissioner of Anhui</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 39th National Affairs Meeting on the 15th. Attendees: Song Ziwen, Wang Boqun, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Zhengting, Lian Shenghai. In attendance: Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Zhijue, Zheng Hongnian, Chen Bulei, Zhang Wohua. Secretary-General: Lü Bichou. Director of Political Affairs: Xu Jingzhi. Chairman: Song Ziwen. The following items were discussed: (1) The joint submission of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Military Affairs regarding the request from He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, to review the petition of Gao Jipu, former Magistrate of Mianyang County, stating that county magistrates who lead teams to suppress bandits during the period of "cleansing the countryside and suppressing bandits" should be given military treatment or assigned military positions, with attached proposed measures, requesting instructions, which was reviewed. The discussion held that county magistrates have a duty to guard the soil, and should go to the scene when there is an emergency in the county. They have the power to command public security police, serve as the head of the defense corps, and concurrently serve as the director of the rural cleansing bureau in the rural cleansing area. The responsibilities are clear, and there is no need to give them a military title. As for the trial of bandit cases, it should be handled separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the Rural Cleansing Regulations and Article 7 of the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China, and there is no need to give them the title of military judge. If the anti-bandit troops violate military orders, it should be reported to the respective levels of commanders for clarification of responsibilities. There is no need to set separate regulations. The provision that the organization of teams must be reported to the high-level military authorities for record is feasible. The resolution was to approve the Ministry's proposal for implementation. (2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the situation of discrimination against Chinese in Mexico has been reported in the past, and Ambassador Xiong has been repeatedly instructed to earnestly negotiate. However, due to discrimination, the number of bankrupt and unemployed overseas Chinese is increasing daily, and funds for dismissal and relief are urgently needed. It is proposed to first order the Ministry of Finance to allocate 50,000 yuan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for remittance to Ambassador Xiong for economical use, and to make further requests after assessing the situation. The resolution was to approve the request. (3) The Ministry of Communications reported that the Ministry has selected regulations from various countries, taken into account the situation in this country, and drafted a postal law of 55 articles, which is hereby submitted for review and transfer to the Legislative Yuan for review. The resolution was to submit the report to the National Government. (4) It was resolved that Zhu Xi, Member of the Anhui Provincial Government and concurrently Civil Affairs Commissioner, be permitted to resign from the concurrent position of Commissioner due to illness, and that the vacant position be filled by Liu Fu, Member of the Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Temporary Martial Law Declared in Changsha</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the Yue-Gui armies launched a large-scale invasion of Hunan, the provincial authorities and the central army have been actively deploying defenses. Although the defenses in southern Hunan are extremely solid, the security of the rear areas still requires careful maintenance. As the provincial capital is a crucial base, all efforts should be made to ensure its security. Hu Da, the Garrison Commander of the provincial capital, acting upon the orders of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, declared temporary martial law in the provincial capital yesterday (the 12th), and convened a security meeting with the heads of various agencies related to security. Those present included Zhang Tiexiang, representative of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters; Peng Zhuo, Chief of the Public Security Bureau; Liu Zeyuan, Deng Duguang, Xiao Zhaoxiong, and Li Zhenchu, Chiefs of various police stations; Li Huaqing, Commander of the Water Police Brigade; Tang Youyue, Magistrate of Changsha County; Zhu Bangji, Commander of the Security Regiment; Yang Zhaojun, Commander of the Volunteer Corps; Wang Yu and Li Xianglin, Commanders of the Garrison Regiment, and more than twenty other people. Hu Da presided over the meeting, and after lengthy discussions, the following resolutions were made: (1) Theaters, hotels, tea houses, restaurants, and the singing and dancing in all households, as well as entertainment activities that produce noise, and the setting off of firecrackers by citizens, will be temporarily prohibited from 10:00 PM every day; (2) The entire city will be divided into eight alert zones, with alert troops on patrol from 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning; (3) Special checkpoints may be set up in important locations in the provincial capital, starting from 12:00 midnight, and sentries will conduct checks on anyone who looks suspicious.

The above measures will be implemented immediately, and a public notice is issued as follows: "Regarding the declaration of martial law, we received an order from Commander-in-Chief He: 1. As the Yue-Gui rebels are attempting to invade Hunan and disrupt the overall situation, troops have been dispatched to block them, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. However, the provincial capital is the political center, and local security is extremely important. At a time when bandits are rampant and hidden dangers are a concern, strict precautions must be taken to eliminate these dangers. From August 12th, temporary martial law is declared in and around the provincial capital, including the suburbs. 2. During the period of martial law, all troops stationed in the provincial capital, including allied forces, as well as the water and land police, the Changsha Security Regiment, and the Volunteer Corps, will be under the command and dispatch of the Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters. The county government will be under its control to unify authority. 3. The martial law regulations have been formulated by this Headquarters and are being issued accordingly. In addition to issuing separate orders for the above three items, they must be strictly observed and widely publicized. This order is issued in addition to a copy of the Provincial Capital Temporary Martial Law Regulations, etc. Upon receipt of this order, it is hereby announced for the information of all residents inside and outside the city and its suburbs. Everyone should maintain their livelihoods and not stray onto the wrong path. If there are evildoers who spread rumors to confuse the public and attempt to disrupt security, they will be dealt with by military law once discovered. Everyone must abide by this." The Provincial Capital Temporary Martial Law Regulations are listed on the left: 1. The area within the city and suburbs of the provincial capital, and within key fortresses in the vicinity, is the martial law zone. 2. During the period of martial law, assemblies, organizations, strikes, and market closures deemed to impede military secrets, as well as reactionary propaganda slogans in newspapers, magazines, books, must be suppressed. For military supplies, their export may be prohibited if necessary. 3. Confiscation may occur of privately owned firearms, ammunition, weapons, fire-starting tools, and other dangerous items if necessary. 4. Mail and telegrams will be inspected. 5.

Residents lodging in the martial law zone may be ordered to leave if necessary. 8. Day or night in the martial law zone, door-to-door inspections or spot checks may be carried out when necessary. Special attention should be paid to places where refugees gather, and they should be monitored. The Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters will temporarily formulate measures for the aforementioned door-to-door inspections, spot checks, and refugee monitoring, considering the circumstances. 9. The performances in theaters may be suspended, and hotels, brothels, tea houses, restaurants, and other entertainment venues will be strictly inspected to prevent the concealment of criminals."

<h3>News from Jiangxi Regarding the Yue-Gui Armies' Invasion of Hunan</h3>
<p>A Statement Issued by the Political Training Department of the Headquarters</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The invasion of Hunan by the Yue-Gui armies has become a reality. According to a certain important person in the Political Training Department of the Headquarters, the details are as follows: (Reporter asks) The news of the Yue-Gui armies sending troops is rampant. Can you shed some light on this? (The important person answers) The Yue-Gui armies are indeed eager to invade Hunan and Jiangxi, incorporating bandits such as Yan Renyi, Hu Fengzhang, and Chen Tiejian on the border of Hunan and Guangdong, and giving them names such as Newly Organized Division and Independent Brigade. According to reports, these groups have already invaded Yizhang and Chen counties. As for the Yue-Gui armies, they are still at the border between Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, and have not actually invaded Hunan. The long-rumored northern offensive, when it comes to changing the stones, is difficult to realize. At this time, it is probably still a bluff, and it will soon subside. (Question) If the Yue-Gui armies do invade Hunan in the future, will the central government launch a punitive expedition? (Answer) The strength of the Yue-Gui armies: the Eighth Route Army of Guangdong has only 40,000 men, and Zhang Gui has only over 10,000 men. After deducting those who stay behind, they cannot send more than 30,000 men. After the rebellion, although they recruited new soldiers, their training is not sophisticated and they are difficult to use. As for the foreign weapons they purchased, they have been detained by the central government in Shanghai. Having soldiers without weapons is also futile. Moreover, launching a long-distance attack is a taboo in military strategy. Hunan's He has 50,000 men, which is more than enough to put down the rebellion. The central government has no need to send troops. At present, the floods are severe, so Commander-in-Chief Dong issued a telegram advocating peace, and will probably not issue a punitive order immediately. (Question) Will the Hunan issue affect the future of bandit suppression? (Answer) The remaining bandits will definitely want to take this opportunity to rekindle their dying embers. However, the central government weighs the priorities, and suppressing bandits is more urgent than suppressing rebels. Therefore, the 19th Route Army and Chiang's division are attacking bandits in the northeast of Xingguo, and the 18th Army and Wei's division are searching and suppressing in the southwest of Ningdu. The remaining Sun Lu and Shangguan's armies, Zhou Zhao, Li, and Mao's divisions are all clearing up in their original locations and have not been transferred. Even the 1st Division of Hu Zongnan's troops is still in Zhangshu and the Huaping area, twenty miles to the south, as a reserve force for bandit suppression. Nanchang to Zhangshu, can be reached in a few hours. It does not hurt to conduct an investigation, and you will know the facts. If the remaining bandits do take the opportunity to move, their suppression will be even faster. (Question) Then does the central government have any deployments between Hunan and Hubei? (Answer) Gu Zhutong has arrived in Wuhan, and he will definitely have some deployments for the Wuhan-Yue area, but it is a military secret and cannot be disclosed. (Question) Can we hear about the current situation in southern Hunan? (Answer) According to reports, Yizhang was extorted 36,000 yuan by Chen and Yan's troops, and Chen County was extorted 52,000 yuan. Various supplies are not included. Rape and looting are no different from the Red bandits, etc.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Disaster Relief Work in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Relief Association Telegraphed the General Association to Allocate Funds</p>
<p>Relief Teams Have Departed for Various Counties One After Another</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Relief Association, it has been in close contact with the Emergency Relief Association. The first step of disaster relief work in Wuhan and various counties has been carried out. Various relief teams have also set off on different routes. However, the river water has not receded slightly for days, and the people's suffering has not been immediately relieved. If the relief funds are not continued, it is feared that they will still become starving people. The Relief Association is very concerned about this and has telegraphed the General Association to quickly allocate huge sums of money for assistance to avoid interruption, while simultaneously seeking ways to maintain the people's problems of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. The Emergency Relief Association, the Provincial Government, and the Garrison Department are also working together. The situation in various parties is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Telegraphed the General Association to Quickly Allocate Huge Sums of Money. The disaster area in Hubei Province is vast, and there are many disaster victims. In Wuhan alone, there are more than 400,000 disaster victims. Providing clothing and porridge requires at least 400,000 yuan per day. There are a total of 10 million disaster victims in various counties. Just in terms of food rations, each person needs 50 cents per day, which requires 500,000 yuan. The current 170,000 yuan relief funds issued by the National Government and the relief funds remitted from various parties total only more than 1 million yuan, which is only enough for two days of needs. The situation of exhaustion can be imagined. The Relief Association specifically telegraphed the Chairman of the General Association, Song Ziwen, on the 10th, requesting that the relief funds received be fully allocated and remitted to relieve the urgent need. Wen Yun, "Respectfully to Chairman Song Ziwen of Shanghai, I have received your Jia telegram and will handle the allocation of health funds accordingly. However, the use of US dollar donations is limited to the corner of Hankou. The vast areas outside the county urgently need relief, and the branch has no ability to cope. I have already clearly stated in your Jia telegram that I sincerely request that the relief funds received be fully allocated and remitted to relieve the urgent need. Respectfully, the Hubei Branch Executive Committee." The association also purchased 10,000 shi of rice in Jiangxi and 30,000 shi of rice in Anhui, but the funds were not available. They telegraphed the General Association again, saying, "Hubei Province needs rice after the disaster. Minister He of Jiangxi has agreed to purchase 10,000 shi of relief rice on behalf of the province, requiring 85,000 yuan. Another 30,000 shi of rice was purchased in Anhui Province, and personnel need to be sent immediately with funds to escort it to Hankou. However, the rice funds are not available. Please allocate 400,000 yuan for application first."</p>
<p>Intensified Epidemic Prevention in Refugee Shelters. There were originally many refugee shelters in Wuhan, such as the Charity Association, New Market, Ewo Godown, Baolin Godown, Longevity Palace, Taiping Guild Hall, Changsha Guild Hall, Tiancheng Cowhide Warehouse, Emperor Lord Palace, St. Joseph's Girls' School, Tongyi Association on the upper section of the Dike Street, Qianrentang in Tianbao Lane, Nancheng Public Office, and Xinhua Company in Hankou; Hongshan, Snake Mountain, Phoenix Mountain, Luojia Mountain, Wuhan University, Wenhua Middle School, Art College, Police Academy, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 9th Middle Schools in Wuchang; and Guishan, Heshan, Meizishan, and Guiyuan Temple in Hanyang. All of them have set up shelters to accommodate refugees. However, the number of people is too large and cannot be fully accommodated. In order to facilitate relief and management, the authorities have decided to accommodate refugees exclusively in Hongshan and Luojia Mountain. Reed sheds are now being built and are scheduled to be completed before the 16th. In terms of epidemic prevention, the Central Health and Epidemic Prevention Team and the provincial and municipal hospitals and the Shanghai Red Cross Society are carrying out rescue operations in different ways. Few refugees have died. However, recently, a mixed cholera and typhoid fever has been discovered in the Heshan area, and more than 10,000 people have been infected. The situation is very critical. The office of the Central Health and Epidemic Prevention Team stationed in Wuhan and the Shanghai Red Cross Society have gone to administer injections.</p>
<p>Bridge Construction is Not Yet Perfect. During the deep water in Hankou, the city's traffic relied entirely on boats, and the cost of hiring them was quite high. Wealthy families could still support it, but the poor did not dare to ask. When the water receded slightly and the Relief Association was established, it was decided to build temporary bridges throughout the city, divided into five main lines. The construction was completed in three days. However, due to the hasty construction, there are still imperfections, such as the bridge body being too narrow, making it difficult to pass; the board frame being not strong, leading to frequent overturning; and the bridge line being too short, so that except for important streets, people still have to wade through the water. Regarding the first and second points, the Public Security Bureau has sent a letter to the association to improve them. The citizens' request to extend the bridge line is even more urgent. It is heard that the association respects public opinion and has instructed Zhao Huanzhang, who is responsible for the project, to handle it separately. Yu Tianbi, who was sent by the Shanghai Social Bureau to work, also made suggestions on maintaining the traffic on the wooden bridge: First, people must go left and right and not walk arbitrarily to hinder traffic. Second, it is forbidden to carry heavy objects or carriers to and from the bridges to avoid danger. The association has also kept this for reference.</p>
<p>Commodities at Parity Prices and Rent-Free Housing. When the flood occurred, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from raising prices, the headquarters specifically ordered the Chamber of Commerce to order merchants not to take the opportunity to raise the prices of daily necessities such as rice, charcoal, oil, and salt. Those who violate this will be dealt with by military law. However, as time went on, the price of goods gradually increased again, and there were situations such as using inferior goods to deceive and obtain high prices. The citizens suffered from this and could not do anything. Recently, the Garrison Headquarters learned of this and detained the unscrupulous merchants for investigation and punishment, to warn the others. On the 11th, Ye Peng, the chief of staff of the headquarters, personally went to the Chamber of Commerce to discuss with He Hengfu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and convened a meeting of representatives of various merchants, explaining the pros and cons repeatedly. The whole group decided to organize a temporary committee to evaluate prices, and elected representatives of the machine rice, grain, flour, kerosene, and grocery groups as members, which was established on the same day to engage in evaluation. In addition, what the people urgently requested was the issue of rent exemption, because the citizens were miserably flooded and could not afford to pay rent even if they tried to save the dead. They have repeatedly requested the Relief Association to inform the owners to exempt the rent for three months. It is heard that the association will send a letter to the commercial owners' association to exempt all of them in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Restricted the Use of Relief Funds in Various Counties. The disaster area in each county is extremely wide, and the disaster victims are eagerly awaiting relief. Although relief funds from various parties have been allocated to the counties, they can only be supported for a while. The provincial government deeply worries that there are situations of misappropriation in various counties, which will hinder the relief progress. On the 11th, it specifically ordered the county magistrates to pay close attention. No matter whether the relief funds are issued by the central and local relief associations or the funds raised by the county itself, they can only be used for relief and must not be diverted to other expenses. If there is any abuse of relief funds for other purposes, it will be severely punished. (September 11th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Water Level Still Rising Sharply</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Wuhu water level has continued to rise sharply for days, exceeding the previous record by more than a foot. The entire territory has become a large lake, and there is no day for the water to recede. The disaster is prolonged, and the problem of urgent relief is even more difficult. The 15,000 yuan relief funds allocated by the central government have been collected by Wu Xingzhou, the representative who went to the province to attend the meeting, but it is still a drop in the bucket and is not enough for distribution. At present, the trend of intercepting and robbing rice in various counties in southern Anhui is growing day by day, which is likely to incite incidents. Qian Danwu, the central disaster investigation commissioner, inspected along the way and witnessed this situation. He has specifically telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting that measures be taken quickly to stop it in order to curb the chaos. Yesterday, the county government captured a bandit in the countryside and cut off his head, which was hung up for public display. Zhang Gongheng, a member of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, departed from Wuhu to inspect various counties in southern Anhui. He has now completed his work and will transfer to Anqing today (the 14th) to inspect various places in central Anhui. Cui Lianggong, She Ceqin, He Wuzi, and other citizens from various counties in southern Anhui specially drafted a presentation, which was presented to Commissioner Zhang and also presented to the Provincial Relief Committee, outlining methods for disaster relief in Anhui, with the content divided into three points, excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>"Lianggong and others believe that it should be divided into three major periods, and the following is a detailed description (1)</p>
<p>The urgent relief period: In urgent relief, it seems that saving the lives of disaster victims should be the top priority. It cannot be stopped for a single day until the accumulated water recedes. The one and only standard that is considered certain during this period is to weigh whether the disaster-stricken area has self-help capabilities, and refer to the severity of the disaster to determine. The views of Central Commissioner Yan are very correct. The disaster-stricken counties in our province account for two-thirds of the entire province. Whatever has happened in the past is irrelevant. In the future, when distributing urgent relief, apart from Wuhu, which has suffered heavy disasters and is also a place for refugees from north and south of the Yangtze River to seek food, and is also an important place for security along the Yangtze River, it should be recognized as having special circumstances. Other disaster-stricken counties should be distributed according to the meaning of urgent relief, and the distribution should be based on whether they can be distributed separately. Even if it cannot be completely fair, it seems better than relying on land area or population. This is the first period. (2) Winter relief period: Winter relief means repairing damaged dikes after the water recedes, maintaining the food and clothing of disaster victims, and ensuring that work will not be abandoned in the future. During this period, it seems that the extent of dike damage in each county should be investigated as the basis for distributing the amount of winter relief. In addition to providing relief to the elderly and weak, the proposal to replace relief with work should be discussed and handled with local authorities. This is the second period. (3) Spring relief period: Spring relief refers to the time when the green and yellow crops are not yet harvested. Without relief funds, there is no way to survive. Without seeds, there is no way to return to farming. During this period, the amount of relief funds should be distributed according to the disaster-stricken land area in each county, because the disaster-stricken land area in each county is roughly the same. The disaster victims can also be inferred from this. Other things can be ignored. This is the third period. In short, there is no good strategy for disaster relief, as ancient people have said clearly. If a certain goal is taken as a single method from beginning to end, I am afraid it will not be enough to show fairness."</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Poyang Disaster Area is Over a Thousand Kilometers</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Flash Floods in the Gan River and Fu River Erupt Again</p>
<p>The Flood Emergency Relief Association Has Been Established</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: This year, due to the flooding of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake in this province, 27 counties, including Nanchang, Xinjian, Jiujiang, Poyang, Duchang, and Pengze, have reported floods. Counties that have not reported include Anyi, Ji'an, and Qingjiang. Among them, the most severe floods are in Jiujiang and Poyang counties. Poyang County is located on the shore of Poyang Lake, at the outlet of the Raohe and Xinhe rivers. The terrain is low-lying. This summer and autumn, the water of the Yangtze River flowed back into the lake, and the water of the Raohe and Xinhe rivers poured into the lake. The overflowing flood caused the Poyang area to be submerged in water for the most part from the beginning of July to the present. According to Poyang County, based on custom and experience, the water will not recede until after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. Regarding the disaster situation in the county, according to the results of the investigation by Zhang Qi, the disaster investigator of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there are a total of more than 282,000 disaster victims, more than 29,000 people displaced by the disaster, more than 1,100 disaster victims who died of illness, more than 10 million in property losses, and more than 980,000 mu of flooded farmland, with an estimated reduction in crop yield of about 70%. The disaster area is 1,417 square kilometers. In addition, Zhao Liantao, the chairman of the county Chamber of Commerce, came to the province yesterday to beg for relief. According to him, the Taiping Embankment in the eastern territory collapsed on the 9th, with a gap of half a mile long, drowning more than a thousand people and collapsing more than a hundred houses. The disaster is severe and can be imagined.</p>
<p>In Jiujiang, the water level is now slightly lower, and the water mark is currently at 52 feet. Refugees are still being continuously accommodated, work relief is being organized, and permits for refugees to go out and beg for food have been suspended. The entire city is making every effort to carry out drainage, disaster relief, epidemic prevention, and other work. Pengze County is still in the water. Duchang, Yujiang, and other counties are still vast expanses of water in low-lying areas. The above is the disaster situation in various places in northern Jiangxi. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of this month, the weather has been cold, with continuous rain for ten days. The Gan River and Fu River also experienced flash floods. The water level in Ji'an was as high as one zhang. Low-lying areas around Xiajiang and Zhangshu were a vast expanse of water, with a water depth of more than one zhang in Wanshe and other places 30 li from the city. The Xixiang Zhiti embankment in Nanchang has already collapsed, with more than one million in losses of farmland and property. At the same time, flash floods on the Fu River caused disasters, and the late rice along the coast was completely submerged. According to news from the Water Police Bureau yesterday, the water level of the Gan River rose by three feet on the 9th and two feet on the 10th. Thatched houses in places across the river from Nanchang, such as Xinzhou and Chao Wangzhou, are about to be submerged, so they are moving away one after another. The replanted late rice in the two counties of Nanxin is in the process of flowering and fruiting, and has been declared hopeless after this flood. Moreover, in the past two days, there have been many floating corpses along the river outside Zhangwai, presumably either killed by the Red bandits or drowned by the flood. Liu Erjing and others, who were sent by the central government to investigate the floods, have taken a ship to Ji'an and other places to investigate.</p>
<p>The Flood Emergency Relief Association, initiated by various circles, held its inaugural meeting at the Provincial Party Headquarters on the 10th. Dozens of people were present, including Zheng Zhongwu, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Xiong Yuxi, the acting chairman of the Provincial Government, and Huang Wenzhi. It was decided to elect representatives of various agencies present as members, and He Yingqin, Lu Dipin, Cao Haosen, Cheng Tianfang, and other 19 people as standing committee members. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce was used as the venue, and fundraising and disaster relief work were actively carried out. (September 10th)</p>
<h3>The Water Outside Jiangdu City Has Not Yet Receded</h3>
<p>Situation of Refugee Accommodation and Treatment</p>
<p>Current Situation of Blocking and Building and Construction Plan</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: After the Yunhe Dike breached, the disaster situation in a dozen or so counties north of the Yangtze River was dire. It has now been almost two weeks since the breach, but the disaster situation in Jiangdu County, such as Zhangwang Town, 25 li from the city, is still submerged in water within a 25 li radius. The shallowest point of Daijia Bridge is 5 feet deep. The water in Yuanyi No. 2 Embankment is level with the eaves. The water in Wushengzhou is over 1 zhang deep. Yesterday (the 13th), the Suzhou Relief Association's office in Yangzhou dispatched personnel such as Kong Kewei to provide relief. They took the Grand Canal out of the Guazhoukou, went east along the Yangtze River, entered Shatou, passed Huajiayao and Bagangkou, and landed at Wudai Bridge. After walking more than 3 li, they finally arrived after detouring more than 120 li. They sailed through the flooded fields in small boats and distributed relief to each household. There are an estimated 8,000 or more disaster victims. There are many other similar cases. On the 14th, those who went to the United Office of Disaster Relief Groups to beg for relief included the fifth district office and various groups in Daqiao, the sixth district office in Yiling, and the seventh district flood relief association, also sending personnel to participate and attend. On the 14th, the United Reception Office of Various Disaster Groups decided to hold regular meetings once every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings at 10:00 AM, and temporary meetings would be held when necessary.</p>
<p>Refugee Accommodation and Treatment. Refugee shelters in Yangzhou Changsheng Temple and other places were already overcrowded. Now, the sixth refugee shelter has been established at Longqing Temple outside the West Gate, accommodating a total of 4,123 people, many of whom are suffering from dysentery, malaria, and other infectious diseases. On the 14th, Chen Peiqiu, a doctor dispatched by the Red Swastika Society to examine the patients, reported that the infectious nature was very rapid. A special commissioner carried a large number of epidemic prevention serums and invited Sun Liqing, a standing committee member of the Western Medical Association, and Xie Jiayin, Zhang Liran, and assistants such as Chen Zhaowen, to rush to Changsheng Temple and other places to administer injections, epidemic prevention needles, and surgery.</p>
<p>Blocking and Building Engineering and Planning. The breaches in the Shao and Gao embankments, except for the 16 breaches in the Shao Embankment that have been blocked by the Jiangdu section, the Black Fish Pond South Breach, which is currently being blocked, is scheduled to be completed on the 17th. The Hualian Pond, which is exposed and dangerous, will also be rushed to completion. Five soil transport ships that have been sealed and hired have been towed by the Runtai ship and went to work on the 14th. At the same time, large and small cables and wooden piles needed for construction are being purchased and transported for the use of blocking and building at Zhaoguan Dam, Hualian Pond, and Laisheng Temple. The temporary office of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau in Yangzhou has implemented the work plan decided by the Post-Disaster Engineering Committee to block and build the breaches in Gaoyou. In addition to purchasing 10,000 shi of stone in advance, it has also purchased various materials and is actively transporting them to the post office to block and build the breaches at Dangjunlou and other places, which can only be completely completed after two months.</p>
<p>Water Level Falling in the East and Rising in the West. As the Shaobo breach has not been blocked, the canal water flows straight down to the east, and a step has been seen to fall. According to the Shaobo report, the water mark has fallen by another two inches. However, the Jiangchao River from Guakou is topped and pushed directly into the canal outside Yangzhou City. Each tide rises by about a foot, and only drops by eight or nine, and is rising step by step every day. Fortunately, the passing hurricane was not realized.</p>
<h3>Important Water Conservancy News from the Jiangsu Construction Bureau</h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Survey the Eastern Dam: The Eastern Dam of Gaochun's eastern border is crucial for water storage and drainage. The Construction Bureau, based on a report from the Liyang County Bureau, states that the water level difference above and below the dam is as great as 9.5 meters, making the situation extremely serious. Recently, Wang Yu was specially commissioned, along with Jiang, a member of the Civil Affairs Bureau, to conduct an on-site inspection. A telegram was received from Commissioner Wang stating that an agreement was reached with Commissioner Jiang to conduct the inspection in Gaochun County on the 15th.</p>
<p>Commencement of Songjiang Seawall Project: The Water Conservancy Bureau received a telegram from the head of the Jiangnan Seawall Works Office stating that he had arrived in Songjiang to make arrangements. On the 1st, he, along with Magistrate Shen, Director Sun, and local gentry, went to Jinshanwei to re-examine the dangerous condition of the seawall. The public sentiment is very urgent. Engineer Bao Zhen of the Shen Engineering Firm will be stationed at the site to take charge of the work, which will commence tomorrow. In addition to the 10,000 yuan allocated by the Songjiang County Bureau, the funds are far from sufficient. A request has been made for an additional 10,000 yuan. The bureau has already telegraphed 10,000 yuan, and Chief Engineer Pei will travel there immediately to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Laying a Light Railway for the Transportation of Supplies for Closing the Yun Embankment Breach: The Construction Bureau, in order to facilitate transportation for closing the breach in the Yun Embankment, deemed it necessary to lay a light railway. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the magistrates of Wuxi, Yixing, and Liyang counties, stating that the bureau is currently undertaking the project to close the breach in the Jiangbei Yun Embankment and urgently needs to transport 250 tons of light railway materials from the Jinghang Road by ship, via Liyang Nandujiang, Yixing, and Wuxi, to Gaoyou for use. Yao Jun and Hu Buren, staff members of the Highway Bureau, have been dispatched to Liyang Nandujiang to expedite transportation matters. In order to ensure speed, the county magistrates are responsible for chartering the necessary steamships and cargo ships by a specific date. The bureau will provide fuel for the steamships and freight charges for the cargo ships. In addition to dispatching the staff members to the counties for coordination, the magistrates are urged to coordinate quickly and without delay.</p>
<h3>The Disaster Situation in Henan Province is Also Severe</h3>
<p>The flooding in Henan Province this year has affected more than 70 counties, with Yancheng, Linying, and Xihua being the most severely affected. These three counties are located in the Shaying River basin. The Shaying River originates from Mount Tianxi and merges with the Ru River in Linru, the Hui River in Yexian, the Li River in Wuyang, the Gan River in Fangcheng, and the Guai River in Neixiang, before converging into a single stream in Yancheng. The water volume is enormous, flowing horizontally to the south-central part of Xihua. The Ying River originates from Dengfeng and, after passing through Yuxian and Xiangcheng, has already become a spectacle. In Linying, it merges with the water collected from various ponds, leading to widespread inundation. The dikes on both sides of these two rivers have been neglected for years, and the riverbeds are silted up, higher than the surrounding land. This summer and autumn, heavy rains persisted for days, causing flash floods. The rivers in the three counties merged into one, surging and overwhelming, leaving the people destitute. The Provincial Relief Committee estimates that 74 counties have been affected by the disaster in the province. Without a substantial amount of 15 million yuan this winter and spring, the starving victims will find it difficult to survive. Although the central government has dispatched personnel with funds for emergency relief, and charitable organizations from both the north and south are running around raising donations, sparing no effort, and all sectors of the military and government are also donating salaries to promote this cause, the disaster area is too vast, making universal relief difficult. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the business community in the province, urging them to remember the disaster victims and generously donate substantial funds for relief.</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in Eastern Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Entire Student Body of Suining County Normal School Abducted</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The southeastern part of Xuzhou has long been plagued by bandits, especially the border area between Tongshan and Suining. Suining County is about 150 miles from Xuzhou. For several years, it has been disturbed by bandits from time to time. Lingchengji, 25 miles east of Suining, is a stronghold for bandits. Recently, the bandits have moved westward from Lingchengji, occupying the Daxiaoguandi Temple area, only about 20 miles from the city. The bandit leaders are Liu Rongduo, Wei San, etc., with about a thousand men. On the 11th of this month, taking advantage of the fact that Zhang Zhan Kui's Third Cavalry Division, which was stationed in Suining, had been transferred to Fengxian, leaving the city empty, the bandits seized the opportunity to lead a crowd to besiege the city. Magistrate Ni Weiqing had already gone to the provincial capital to arrange for the arrival of replacement troops. The county seat only had a police force of over a hundred men who guarded the city and kept the city gates tightly closed. The bandits failed to achieve their goals after attacking from all sides. Outside the east gate, there is a county-run normal school headed by Principal Bao Geng Guang, with about a hundred students. After looting outside the city, the bandits abducted all the students and two teachers, returning to the Lingchengji area to occupy it. Afterwards, the county government urgently telegraphed a report to the province and requested troops from the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Magistrate Ni returned from the province to Xuzhou on the 13th and immediately telegraphed Suining City to inquire about the situation and invited representatives from the party headquarters to Xuzhou to discuss the aftermath. He plans to go to the province to report again. It is reported that the bandits have released dozens of students, keeping more than ten wealthy ones for ransom. The northeast gates of Suining City are still closed. Only the west gate, which is the main road to Xuzhou, can be opened. Transportation in various districts of the county is obstructed due to banditry. As for the replacement troops, the Pacification Commissioner's Office initially dispatched Liang Guanying's 25th Route Army. Before Liang's troops arrived, there are rumors that Zhang Huatang's First Cavalry Division has been reassigned from Yaowan to the area. (14th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju to Inspect Eastern Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and concurrently the Chief of Clearing Countryside in Shandong and Henan, after returning from Henan, immediately began to handle the clearing of the countryside. Now the provincial bandit suppression conference has concluded, and the generals have returned to their defense areas, mobilizing troops and actively suppressing bandits according to the six designated areas. Han specially took the Jiaoji train to the Jiaodong area this afternoon (the 13th) to inspect the troops. Key figures from the party, government, and military agencies went to the station to see him off. At 5:30 PM, Han arrived at the station by car, escorted by a company of guards led by Yu Jinghuan, the chief of the General Staff's administrative section. According to Han, Ma Hong Kui's 15th Route Army was ordered to transfer to Henan, and the defenses they left behind will be taken over by Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division in the Tai'an area, and Zhan Shutang's 81st Division in the Yizhou area. "I haven't seen Zhan's troops for half a year," he said, "so I'm going to give them a lecture before they head to Linyi, Tancheng, Feixian, and Yishui. I will inspect the garrisons in the places I pass through, such as Zhoucun, Qingzhou, Changle, Weixian, Gaomi, Jiaoxian, and will also take the opportunity to inspect the politics of the various counties. I expect to be back in Jinan in four or five days." Han also invited Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Reorganization Committee to talk, telling him that since Zhan's troops are going to Yizhou, "you can send a telegram to the local authorities in advance to take care of everything (because Zhang is from Yizhou)." Zhang said that he had already sent a telegram, and then they said goodbye. Han boarded the train and left Jinan eastward at 5:45 PM. Before Han returned to the province, military affairs will be temporarily handled by Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division, and political affairs will be temporarily managed by Li Shuchun, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department.

<h3>President of South Manchuria Railway Inspects Andong</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Petition for Establishment of Steel Plant and Railway Between Shin-Gishu and Ryongampo Andong Correspondence: The newly appointed President and Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), Uchida and Eguchi, respectively, departed from Dalian late last month and inspected the line. They have now completed their inspections and arrived in Andong at 7:20 AM on the 8th of this month by train from Shenyang. Leaders from the Japanese community, government, commerce, and industry gathered at Andong Station to welcome them. President Uchida and Vice President Eguchi shook hands with each of those who welcomed them after disembarking from the train. They were then led to the VIP room by the stationmaster of Andong Station and Consul Mizawa to rest for a moment before meeting with influential Japanese officials and civilians to inquire about the situation. Their entourage had refreshments in another room. The entourage included Shanxi, a director; Dr. Shiba; Deputy Director of the Technical Bureau Hashi; Councilor Lin; Chief of the Agricultural Affairs Division Matsushima; Chief of the Railway Department Furu Kawa; Secretaries Matsudaira and Yagi; Clerks Itakura and Nakamura from the Document Section; and Consultants Yamai and Kenda—a total of twelve people. At the same time, Governor Kimura of Shin-Gishu and Heads of the Chamber of Commerce Tada and Kato crossed the river from Shin-Gishu to Andong and joined the Head of the Andong Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Arakawa, and three others to pay their respects. Tada and others stated that they had come to represent Japanese residents of Andong and Shin-Gishu to petition for the early realization of the establishment of a Showa Steel Plant in Shin-Gishu and to request that the SMR provide practical assistance in laying a light railway section between Shin-Gishu and Ryongampo to connect with the Gyeongui Line to facilitate transportation in Western Korea. Vice President Eguchi replied that although the two matters are urgent, they are major and cannot be determined in the shortest possible time. However, within the realm of possibility, he would do his best to assist in their realization. Eguchi also stated the SMR's future goals for new economic policies and that starting in the spring of next year, the SMR would improve education along the line. At this time, reporters from various Japanese newspapers requested interviews. Uchida gathered the reporters together and gave a brief answer because of time constraints. Then, according to the predetermined schedule, he separately conducted inspections.</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Fundraising in Harbin</h3>
<p>Various Parties Actively Participating, Hundreds of Thousands Already Raised</p>
<p>Total Mobilization of the Education Community, Unfortunate Tragedy Occurs</p>
<p>Municipal Government to Undertake a 150,000 Yuan Fundraising Campaign</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: People from all walks of life here have enthusiastically risen to the occasion to raise funds for the Jianghuai flood disaster. Those already underway include the fundraising by the Harbin Provincial Flood Relief Association, which plans to raise 200,000 yuan. The Bankers' Association has advanced 100,000 yuan, using 80,000 yuan to purchase grain to be transported to the disaster area and remitting 20,000 yuan to the Shanghai Relief Association for distribution. The Municipal Bureau of the Special City held a four-day fundraising fair from the 5th to the 8th of this month, raising over 30,000 yuan in cash, which will also be remitted to the disaster area in the coming days to be distributed by General Zhu Ziqiao. The Special District Education Commissioner Zhou Shouyi also ordered all primary and secondary school teachers and students in the district to mobilize on the 9th of this month to solicit donations from all parties, exerting their efforts for one day, achieving great results. However, an unfortunate tragedy occurred, which was truly unexpected. Prior to this, the Education Department had prepared for many days, printing donation booklets and distributing them according to the number of students and staff in each school. On that day, they were free to solicit donations from the public. Each secondary school student received a donation booklet and was required to fill it out, regardless of the amount of the donation. Primary school students received one booklet for every five students and were required to raise at least five jiao. Teachers and staff also received a donation booklet each to solicit donations. Therefore, on that day, the education community of the Special District, from the Commissioner to the laborers, mobilized, and the streets and trams were filled with male and female students soliciting donations. There are over 30,000 students in the Special District. By evening, the total amount raised was over 30,000 yuan, which was extremely satisfactory. Among them, Commissioner Zhou Shouyi personally raised over 2,000 yuan, and some laborers raised 20 to 30 yuan. The school with the best fundraising results was the District First Girls' Middle School, which raised over 4,000 yuan. The others also raised 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, or even 800 to 900 yuan. The individual with the best fundraising record was Yuan Xinglian, a student from the First Girls' Middle School, who raised 224 yuan. However, Gao Qinglan, a student from the ninth grade of junior high school at the school, was unfortunately hit by a No. 64 car while soliciting donations in Qinjiagang at 1:00 PM that afternoon. She suffered a fractured skull and died on the morning of the 10th. Gao was from Shandong and only 18 years old. Her parents are both alive. The education community is deeply saddened by her death. A memorial service is scheduled for the 13th. This is also an unfortunate incident in the charitable fundraising efforts in Harbin. It is reported that the Binjiang Municipal Preparatory Office has also joined forces with gentry merchants and various agencies in Daowai to hold a 150,000 yuan fundraising campaign. The plan has been finalized and is expected to be launched around the 15th. Once the funds are collected, they will be remitted to the disaster area through the Jilin Provincial Government, and the victims can expect another drop of sweet dew. (10th)</p>
<h3>The Conspiracy of the Third International and Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(Continuation from the Previous Issue)</p>
<p>An Open Letter from the Standing Committee of the National Labor Union Discussing the International Labor Union Issue:</p>
<p>The theories of the Li Lisan faction are purely adventurist. The various struggles and strikes under Li's guidance were not sufficiently prepared in advance, and there was no understanding of the tactics of struggle. As for the various political slogans, they were also too mechanical, so the results were minimal. In the future, we must have a deep understanding of the characteristics of each struggle and have corresponding preparations and meticulous plans. There are still a few comrades at the lower levels who are deluded, thinking that Li Lisan's theories are based on a position of struggle, and that the theories we currently hold are for peaceful progress. This kind of misconception must be corrected (the best way is to publicly publish this text and the resolutions of the Fifth Congress). We must actively prepare to cope with the struggles that are about to break out in various factories, such as the struggles in silk factories, which are one example, because these struggles often occur during the plum rain season. We have sent a comrade to the silk factories to conduct a detailed investigation and encourage workers to make demands to the factory management (these demands should be immediately reported to the Standing Committee). The comrades responsible for various industries have also received considerable training, so that they have a deep understanding of the actual situation in each industry, so as to gradually realize our plan. There are about three million workers in China, but only two or three thousand of them are in contact with us, which proves that we still need to intensify our work and proves that we have been too indifferent to them in the past, so we are unable to lead various struggles. It is undeniable that we do not have a clear idea of how to start mass work. Therefore, we should immediately establish committees separately for various important industries, and we hope that the Central Committee will quickly send cadres to assist us. The comrades who will be sent to work in various places in the future should be given a mission to actively establish these committees wherever they go. We already have a comrade working in the Shanggang Iron Manufacturing Industry. As for Comrade He Zhongrong, he still has a task to go to Wuhu. When he returns to Shanghai in the future, he plans to be sent to work in the concession. After he leaves Shanghai, we have found a suitable comrade to replace his work. In short, the labor movement of our party under the leadership of Li Lisan is nothing more than armchair strategy. If we do not change our strategy immediately, it will inevitably become more difficult in the future. Within a week, we will give priority to establishing three committees for the textile, steel, and mining industries (the location of the mining committee is in Tianjin). However, there are no suitable comrades to be in charge of the textile industry, so for the time being, only the director of the Women's Department can temporarily act as its agent. We hope that the Central Committee can select one person from the fifteen students who have recently returned to China to take on this task. Recently, some lower-level comrades have believed that the organization of various committees from top to bottom does not meet the needs of reality, and some people believe that these affiliated organizations should only be given corresponding work within the scope of their name, so that they have independence. This kind of argument is not without merit, because in the past, these affiliated organizations have actually replaced the labor unions. In the past, when we recruited cadres, we always selected comrades from various factories and sent them to work elsewhere, thus often losing contact with the workers. Therefore, we should immediately change our methods. We plan to organize a training group. All comrades who are sent to work in factories must undergo this training. In the past, when we organized labor unions, the superior organs sent comrades to various factories and ordered them to do so, which was unavoidable. In the future, we should first send comrades to work among the masses, organize real labor unions, and be completely based on the workers' autonomy to conform to the spirit of democratic organization. We must intensify this work. We have already drafted a five-point plan and expect it to be approved within a day or two.</p>
<p>In the next week, we will discuss and review the plan for labor work in the Soviet area again, because in the past we have often ignored the yellow labor unions. If we do not study them in detail, we will have no way to understand their actual situation. When we discuss this issue, we should invite the comrades who are currently working in the yellow postal union and tram union to participate. At the same time, when we discuss other affiliated organizations, we must also invite the comrades who are related to those organizations to participate, so as to avoid alienation. Our most urgent task at present is to eliminate the erroneous ideas of the past about this kind of work, because from the perspective of the history of the party, it can be said that until today, the meaning of labor unions has not been clearly understood. In the past, right-wing forces were everywhere, and even now, there are still such people active. As a result, the party and the labor unions are almost in an antagonistic position, and in the past, comrades only obeyed the decisions of the superior organs and had no room for discussion, so it was also unavoidable. Regarding this issue, we will have a special article published in the "Worker" and conduct a public discussion of daily issues. The National Labor Union has adopted the ssoT draft and accepted the evaluation of the union's congress. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Record of the Inspection of the Seawall by Various Sectors: The Jinshanwei seawall has not been repaired for many years. Last month, strong winds and huge waves destroyed the second and third sections of the seawall, and the fourth and fifth sections are also in imminent danger. On the 13th, leaders from the Party, government, military, and business communities of Songjiang County, accompanied by Xue Xingbei, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau's Embankment Works Office, and technician Shen Baozhang, sailed there on a steamship at 7:00 AM. After arriving at the port, they jointly boarded the embankment to inspect it, examining each section in detail from east to west. The fifth section did not have any major dangers. The large yellow stones placed inside the wooden stakes of the fourth section were swept onto the embankment by huge waves, and the erosion of the mud posed a great danger. The third section is a cement project contracted by a construction factory in Shanghai and is not yet completed. This time, it was also destroyed by the waves. It is generally said that the designer of this section lacks engineering and physics knowledge. According to the old method of repairing embankments, wooden stakes are first driven in, spaced appropriately, and the middle is filled with stone blocks. Stone walls are then erected behind the stakes and covered with mud. When huge waves come, they are blocked by the stone blocks, and the water enters the stone holes, which is enough to disperse their force. This method is more complete. Now, with the cement wall standing on the seashore, when huge waves rush in, they will encounter an obstacle and their force will be stimulated to be even more violent. The project manager should find a way to improve it. It has been determined that the junction between the second section and the first section is the most dangerous because the mountains of Jinshan, Shoushan, and Minshan face each other overseas, and the tides are rapid, impacting the embankment with increasing intensity. Early repairs are necessary to avoid the autumn floods of the 18th of August. Subsequently, the merchants discussed the construction plan. In addition to the original 200 workers near the embankment, it is planned to recruit another 200 workers and have 200 soldiers dispatched from the Second Provincial Security Regiment, totaling 600 workers, to transport materials such as linen bags together to repair the embankment. The project is estimated to cost more than 34,000 yuan. In addition to borrowing 10,000 yuan from the road construction mu tax of this county, the remaining funds will be requested from the Construction Bureau by various sectors of the local community. Director Xue Xingbei will go to the province to collect them. After the inspection, they returned to the city. Sun Shiheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Executive Committee, will also report the inspection to the provincial department in detail and forward it to the Construction Bureau to quickly allocate funds for repairs to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Lake Bandits Kidnap and Murder: Donghetou Village, 12 miles from the town of Dongshan, was suddenly attacked at 2:00 AM yesterday (the 15th) by two bandit boats carrying more than 20 lake bandits armed with long and short firearms. They landed and swarmed into the home of Xu Yunfeng, looting for an hour, killing Xu's daughter-in-law, Guo, and kidnapping Xu Dingkui and a Ye surname mother and her two children. They stole a large amount of clothing, jewelry, and silver dollars. Afterwards, they took the stolen goods and headed south on Taihu Lake. The Eighth Water Police Team, upon hearing the news, dispatched a team to pursue and suppress them. Also, multiple bandit boats were discovered on the lake surface of Benji Village in Hengjing on the 14th, looting fishing boats. After the villagers reported it, the water police went to suppress them, and the bandits left. Chen Lin, the chief of the Eighth Public Security Branch in charge of the area, reported to the county government yesterday (the 15th) that bandit traces have been appearing in Hengjing since late August, causing public anxiety, and requested that the county government send a team to search and suppress them.</p>
<p>The Death of Zhang Li's Suspect: Zhang Li, a resident of Funing, outside Xumen, who was 59 years old, opened a fecal business in Suzhou. Several years ago, she recruited Li Mingkui as her son-in-law. However, because her son was abused to death, the relationship between Zhang and Li became strained. Meanwhile, Li had married Chen as his second wife, but still lived with Zhang. Yesterday (the 14th), Li Mingkui had an argument with Zhang Li over a minor matter. Yesterday morning (the 15th), Chen went out, and Li took his nine-year-old son and left. When Chen returned, she found Zhang Li had hanged herself in the room, and she had been dead for a long time. The ligature mark was very suspicious, and there was a wooden chair under her feet, higher than her feet. Neighbors were spreading rumors and discussing it. The local security officer has reported it to the local court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Conflict Between Refugees and Villagers: Yesterday afternoon, more than a hundred male and female refugees from Mengcheng, Anhui, arrived at Chang'an Bridge in the northern district. Supporting the old and leading the young, they passed through Dongwang Village, taking vegetables from the fields, chickens and ducks from chicken coops and ponds along the way. At first, the villagers closed their doors to avoid them. But after the refugees left, they saw that the loss of vegetables and livestock was too great. So they beat gongs to gather a crowd and bravely pursued them. When they reached the end of the street in Chang'an Bridge, the two sides confronted each other, wielding wooden sticks and fighting. As a result, both sides were seriously injured. Shops in the town, fearing that they would be affected, quickly closed their doors and stopped business. They also telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau, requesting police to suppress the situation. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched twenty armed police officers to rush to the countryside. It was reported that the chiefs of the Anzhen Branch and the Bashiqiao Xia Branch had also received the report and sent police to rush there. But the refugees had already fled wounded to Bashiqiao. The town's merchant corps, together with the police, were fully armed to defend. The refugees did not dare to stay and went to Zhangjing Bridge.</p>
<p>Another Robbery Reported in the Countryside: At 11 o'clock the night before last, five or six bandits suddenly came to Zhou Heqing's house in Bashiqiao Town, which is under the county's jurisdiction. They climbed over the wall and entered the house, first tying up Heqing's son, Songshou, and then searching the room. Heqing heard the alarm and fled out the back door, beating a gong to call the police. The robbers hurriedly took the stolen goods and left. After checking, it was found that only clothes and jewelry worth more than ten yuan were stolen.</p>
<p>Banquet Donation Reduced to Contract Collection: The Wuxi Banquet Education Donation was implemented on January 1st of this year. Initially, Xu Gongdu contracted it for 2,400 yuan per month until the end of June, accumulating arrears of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Then the Finance Bureau directly collected it. But it was during the summer, and the collection did not improve. Recently, Qian Yinzai contracted it, with a monthly contract amount of 1,440 yuan. It was decided that it would be paid monthly starting in August. The Finance Bureau has commissioned it and is contacting restaurants and chefs in the surrounding villages to subcontract.</p>
<p>Hua Takes Over as Chief of the Public Security Bureau: Xu Jigui, the Chief of the County Public Security Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to Qingpu. The vacancy was filled by Hua Pu (Jianren), a local resident and current Captain of the 23rd Battalion of the 6th District of the Provincial Water Police, by order of the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Hu. After receiving the order, Mr. Hua took a train from Beijing to Wuxi on the 14th and went to the bureau at 8 o'clock yesterday morning to take over. After Xu handed over, he took a train from Wuxi to Shanghai and then went to Qingpu to take up his new post.</p>
<p>False Report of Robbery Case Opens for Trial: Guo Boxuan, the son of the late strongman Guo Zizhen, who lives in Guoxiang Lane, Bashiqiao, Sixth District (Tianxiashi) under the county's jurisdiction, is now a clerk in the Third Section of the Provincial Government. Last month, he returned home due to illness. He had a feud with Dai Ada, a resident of nearby Daixiang Lane. This time, when Dai Ada returned to Wuxi from Shanghai, Guo Boxuan lured him to his home to talk. Then he instigated Shen Jinbao and Zhao Longxing to tie Dai up with hemp rope. Then he rushed to the 12th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which has jurisdiction over the area, and falsely reported a robbery. The Chief of the Branch, Tan Weinan, immediately sent police to bring both parties to the bureau and send them to the headquarters. They were transferred to the County Court Procuratorate. After Prosecutor Du opened the court for questioning, he ordered Dai Ada to be temporarily detained. Guo Boxuan, Shen Jinbao, and Zhao Longxing were released on bail pending further investigation. Guo and others then found a shop guarantor at the Jinxing Garden Hotel at the entrance of Taiping Lane to bail them out.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Murder of Husband Case: The Main Culprit Arrested: Wu Agen, of Mengshu Village in the Sixth District of Wuyi, about five li from Dongheng Lin, was murdered with a knife and buried by his wife, Huang, and her lover, Shi Jingen, to cover up the crime. Recently, the eldest son of the deceased, Chunsheng, filed a complaint with the County Court. On the 14th, the Henglin Public Security Bureau arrested the murderer, Shi Jingen. According to the interrogation, he was 37 years old and from the same village as Wu Agen. He had been having an affair with Wu's wife, Huang, for three or four years. Agen worked in Shanghai and often quarreled with his wife when he came back. His wife had planned to murder him several times and had discussed it with him, but she couldn't find a way to do it. On June 28th of this year, Agen returned from Shanghai. At 2 pm on July 1st, his wife called him to his house. He saw Agen sleeping on a long bench, with his head resting on another square stool. He was sound asleep. At this time, two children were playing in the back village. Huang gave him a kitchen knife, and he chopped Agen on the left side of his head. He woke up, turned over, and wanted to resist. Huang stepped forward and held him down with a knife around his waist. Then he chopped Agen on the front of his head. Agen stopped breathing and died. Then Huang wrapped the body in a cotton robe, carried it to the sheep pen, covered it with grass, and wiped the blood stains on the door panel. He buried it in the field at midnight, etc. The Bureau Chief, Wang Quan, immediately recorded the confession and sent it to the City Public Security Bureau. On the 15th, he was transferred to the Court Procuratorate for interrogation.</p>

<p>Taixing Bandit Arrested in Jingjiang: A wine merchant from Taixing was selling wine in Shanghai. He took 4,000 yuan and took a riverboat to Tianxing Bridge to land. The 25th Route Army stationed there came forward to inspect, and the foreign money was seen by the bandits. They followed for more than two li, strangled the wine merchant, and robbed the money. The local Public Security Bureau Water Police heard the news and searched everywhere. On the morning of the 12th, they were led to our county. They saw the bandit Chen Zuolin entering the West Gate. The police immediately pursued him. At the Shanhai Town inside the North Gate, Wang Fuxin, a post policeman, assisted in the capture. Wang's hand was bitten. After the bandit was captured, the county government interrogated him and immediately prepared a document and handed it over to the police to take him back to Taixing for legal action.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Raises Clothes for Disaster Victims: The Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed the county chiefs of each county yesterday, saying that this year, the disaster-stricken areas in the province are almost nine out of ten. The counties along the canal are especially tragic. The provincial government has been actively preparing and implementing the reception and relief efforts. However, as the deep autumn is approaching and the severe cold is coming, the issue of clothing for the disaster victims should also be prepared in advance. In addition to telegraphed requests to the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and orders to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Department, the used clothes of the military and police should be allocated to the provincial government as soon as possible and transferred to the Relief Association for distribution. The county chief is urgently ordered to immediately announce to all sectors that anyone who has stored used clothes for men and women, young and old, single cotton, silk, and cloth, should donate them as much as possible and hand them over to the county government for transfer to the provincial government, so that they can be transferred to the Zhen Association for distribution and distribution, and they should be informed to the township heads and deputies in each district and town, and they should be responsible for soliciting donations to ensure that the people affected by the disaster can obtain cold-proof equipment.</p>
<p>Grain Circulation Allowed Within Jiangsu Province: The Jiangsu Province has suffered from severe flooding, and each county feels a lack of grain. Recently, local people in Jiangning, Yizheng, Liuhe, and other counties have gathered to discuss the prohibition of the transport of grain outside the county. After the county governments and others submitted their opinions to the provincial government, it was heard that the provincial government had instructed the counties that grain in accordance with the regulations should be allowed to circulate within the province. Grain merchants are allowed to circulate if they sell grain within the province, and the county is ordered to investigate and handle the matter properly, so as to take both into account.</p>
<p>Relief Association Requests to Dredge Disaster Victims: The Temporary Relief Association for the Flood in Northern Jiangsu said that a number of disaster victims from Northern Jiangsu arrive in Zhenjiang every day, and nearly a thousand of them stay. The Zhenjiang reception centers are full and there is no room for more. If more are transported in, regardless of how many, they will have to sleep in the open. If no measures are taken to dredge them, it will be difficult to receive them. Therefore, the chairman Ye was telegraphed yesterday, requesting that more reception centers be set up in the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to dredge them separately. The county chiefs of each county were also telegraphed, instructing them to properly arrange and transfer the disaster victims when they arrive by truck in Zhenjiang. The Relief Association also telegraphed the county chiefs of Rugao and Taixing, saying that there are many disaster victims in Xingdong and other places, and they cannot go out to make a living without ships. Please send more tugboats to transport them nearby to Shanghai, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places to find food.</p>

At midnight the other day, more than thirty bandits suddenly came to the house of Chen Peisheng, a wealthy household in Dacheng Village. They intended to break in. Chen woke up in shock, quickly grabbed the gun he had prepared, climbed onto the roof, and beat a gong to call the police. The neighbors responded to the sound and gathered the villagers to rescue him. Seeing that the situation was not good, the thieves fled.</p>
<p>Hangping Highway Actively Under Construction: Although the road surface of the Zha Ping section of the Hangping Highway has been completed, the bridges have not yet been built, so it has not yet been opened to traffic. Now the Highway Management Office has sent a large number of workers to the Hongni Weir, the central receiving point of the Pingzha branch road. After surveying, it is planned to build five bridges: Yangshugang Bridge, Gaoqiao Bridge, Beihong Bridge, Beihelou Bridge, and Xinqiao Bridge.

<p>Dingyuan Telegrams for Joint Attack on Communist Bandits: On the 27th of last month, a large number of communist bandits approached Dingyuan County, 120 li from Hefei. County Chief Zhang Yuanqun mobilized the county's security corps and fought fiercely with the communist bandits for two days and nights. They broke through the bandit dens in Zao Xiangmiao, Lujia Gang, and Wu Jiawei, killing the bandit leader Dai Guoxing and many other bandits. The communist bandits retreated to the junction of Shou, Ding, and He and entrenched themselves in an attempt to make a comeback. The County Chief telegraphed the General Headquarters and the Provincial Government for assistance. The Provincial Government sent the First Battalion of the Special Service Regiment, which arrived in Dingyuan on the 2nd. They are now opening to the southwest countryside to assist in the suppression. The telegram requested the Hefei County Government to block and suppress them. The acting County Chief ordered the district regiments of the northeast, four, five, and north, and two villages to strictly guard against them on the 6th.</p>

The national martial arts competition also started at the same time. The audience was still large. Suddenly, the ink clouds became thicker, and the rain poured down. Fortunately, the rain stopped briefly, and the Decathlon and national martial arts competitions continued. The ball field had become a pool of water, so the women's volleyball and tennis matches were postponed.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball Starts Yesterday</h3>
<p>丨Daxia Defeats the Railway Team丨</p>
<p>丨Qingguang Defeats Hudong丨</p>
<p>The men's basketball game started last night. Two games were originally scheduled, but for the last game, Nanyang vs. Hujiang, Nanyang withdrew after the school authorities did not approve the registration. The results of the other two games are as follows:</p>
<h3>(1) Daxia Turns Defeat into Victory</h3>
<p>Railway Team Loses 30 to 36</p>
<p>At first, the Railway Team was unstoppable, and Daxia had no match. The Railway Team had 12 points, and Daxia had not scored yet. At this time, Liang Runwei scored a point for Daxia to open the record. From then on, Daxia rose sharply, and the situation gradually improved. One point was added to another, and it became 19 to 20, only one point behind. In the first half, the Railway Team seemed to win by one point with 22 to 21. The two teams refused to let go, and there was no distinction between them for a long time. It was not until after 30 to 29 that Daxia scored a goal and surpassed them. In the last five minutes, Daxia added six points, while the Railway Team had already softened. Referee Zhou Zongqi.</p>

<h3>(2) Qingguang Defeats Hudong by a Landslide</h3>
<p>Result 62 to 12</p>
<p>Qingguang's talent and skills are all above Hudong's. However, at the beginning of the game, Hudong gave the audience a good impression. Feng Huifu scored a goal and opened the record. Qingguang attacked several times, and Chen Hualu returned in triumph. From then on, he rose straight up and controlled the overall situation. The first half was 22 to 4. In the second half, the generals of both sides exchanged and showed their skills. Gu Yi's collapse had become the situation. Hudong tried hard, but it was difficult to be effective. As a result, Qingguang defeated Hudong by 62 to 12. Referee Shao Ji.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Opens with Southeast Beating Jinan by a Landslide</h3>
<p>31 to 18</p>
<p>The Southeast Jinan Liangjiang Triangular Women's Basketball Tournament, Southeast defeated Jinan by a landslide of 31 to 18 in the first game last night and won the final, Referee Shao Ji.</p>
<p>Southeast's Smooth Sailing: Pan Yueying opened the record for both teams with a single-handed shot, scoring five points in a row. Cao Xiu'e scored seven to zero. Situ Wei saw the difficulties and joined forces with Chen Yuzhi to win four or five points. In the second quarter, Pan Yueying scored seven points alone, and Situ Wei scored five points alone. The result of the first half was 14 to 10. In the second half, Southeast replaced Zhou Wenjuan with substitute Dou Wende, which was the heyday of Southeast. In the third quarter, Pan, Cao, and Dou scored 12 points together. The result was 31 to 15.</p>
<p>Pan Yueying Praised Throughout the Field: Pan Yueying of Southeast scored 21 points alone last night and was praised throughout the field. She shot accurately and was agile. The two teams were the leaders. The forwards of Southeast cooperated well, but sometimes they could not distribute the whole field, making the enemy lose sight of the east while taking care of the west, which was often a disease. The three guards defended tightly and were well-positioned. Jiang Huaixuan was able to cope with ease and could not run fully yesterday, otherwise, she would have been even more outstanding. Hu Wang's courage and agility were commendable and were indeed the rivals of Liangjiang.</p>
<p>Situ Wei's Difficult to Support Alone: The only one worth watching in the Jinan team was Situ. She advanced and retreated in an orderly manner. Of the 15 points scored, Situ scored 13. The other two forwards crashed east and west without knowing what to do. The three forwards were not accurate in shooting the basket. Situ often could not enter. The guards were good. At the end, forward Chen Yuzhi suddenly fell ill and left the field. Situ Wei retreated to the guard position to monitor Pan Yueying, but she could not reverse the decline.</p>

<h3>Decathlon Promotes Zhong Lianji</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the All-Around Sports, and only the second half of the Decathlon was held. Therefore, the track and field was still deserted. Fortunately, there were staff and athletes in the national martial arts competition, as well as male and female visitors, which created a lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, the weather was not good. After the high hurdle competition of the Decathlon was over, when the discus was just beginning, the rain poured down and continued for about half an hour. The general competitors, referees, athletes, and boy scouts were all turned into drowned chickens. They had no choice but to announce a stop to the competition. So, they all looked for places to hide from the rain. In a short time, the podium and the athletes' rest area were crowded. In less than twenty minutes, a lot of water accumulated on the track and in the competition field. Fortunately, the floating clouds blew over and stopped at two o'clock. With an order, the boy scouts and the small two on the field responded to each other and led the way in the water diversion movement. In a short time, there was no drop of water on the track, so the competition continued. But several inches of water had accumulated in the competition field, so the second half of the Decathlon was not good yesterday.</p>
<h3>Criticism of the Second Half of the Decathlon</h3>
<p>Except for the high hurdles, the rest of the second half of the Decathlon held yesterday were affected by the rain, and the results were not good. Luo Dexian was originally expected to compete with Zhong, but he lost a lot of points in the pole vault and javelin events, totaling more than 90 points. In the future, it is hoped that Luo will work hard on the sports events in which the results are not good. Zhong's discus and 1,500 meters should also be practiced more often in the future. Otherwise, it will be difficult to compete with Zhang Lingjia of Liaoning and other Decathlon athletes from Beiping and other places for the championship in the future national games. Liang Jun became a good material for the long jump and triple jump. In the future, he should focus on training and not be greedy for more, so that the results of a single event will not improve much. Therefore, he should give up practicing the Decathlon.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Round of National Arts Competition</h3>
<p>The municipal sports meet's national arts competition held its opening ceremony yesterday afternoon around 1 PM. Those in attendance included Chu Minyi, Wu Jianquan, Tong Zhongyi, Wu Huichuan, Ye Dami, Lao Boshi, Liu Desheng, and referees Ye Liang, Chen Xuliang, Ma Yueliang, etc. The ceremony was carried out according to protocol. First, Chen Jiaxuan, chairman of the National Arts Department, informed all members of the rules and points of attention, as well as the attitude that athletes should adopt. Next, Chu Minyi delivered an instructional speech, encouraging everyone to strive for progress and win honor for the national arts community. Immediately after, he announced the start of the combat competition. Just as one group finished competing, a heavy rain suddenly arrived, and the people in the field rushed to the command post and basketball room to take shelter. Even the mat shed, which was less than ten feet in size, sheltered more than thirty people. Most of them were soaked through, resembling drowned chickens. At 3 PM, the rain stopped, and the competition resumed. However, the arena was slippery after the rain, causing competitor Cao Zufa to fall and slightly injure his arm. In total, six groups of men's lightweight class, two groups of light-middleweight class, and one group of women's class, totaling nine groups, competed. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Men</p>
<p>(Lightweight Class) Group 1: Si Wang Xijie wins; Yi Wu Weng Sheng wins.</p>
<p>(Lightweight Class) Group 2: Yi Shu Shaozhe wins; Er Si Dong Songxiang wins.</p>
<p>(Lightweight Class) Group 3: San Yi Chen Zhenyi wins; Si Ba Song Baomao wins.</p>
<p>(Lightweight Class) Group 4: Er Liu Zhu Qingyong wins; Si Jiu Zhou Yusheng wins.</p>
<p>(Lightweight Class) Group 5: Liu Gu Muchan wins; Wu Wei Hanlu.</p>
<p>(Lightweight Class) Group 6: Wu Qi Liu Qinjun wins; San Zhang Baoxing.</p>
<p>(Light Middleweight Class) Group 7: Si Qi Liu Fengming wins; Yi Yi Cao Jingbo.</p>
<p>(Light Middleweight Class) Group 8: Ba Wang Zhongxiao wins; San San Cao Zufa.</p>
<p>Women</p>
<p>(Heavyweight Class) Group 1: (San) Zhai Lianyuan wins (Er) Gao Junzhu.</p>
<p>On this day, the fighting style of the first group in the competition was relatively poor, but from the second group onwards, the performance gradually improved, becoming even better towards the end. Both sides used fists and legs, mostly legally. In particular, Liu Fengming with number 47, Gu Muchan with number 6, and Chen Zhenyi with number 31 were the best. As for Song Baomao with number 48 and Wei Hanming with number 5, although they unfortunately did not win, their body techniques and striking techniques were flawless. The women's group had good striking techniques, but their strength was not sustained, so the referees had to slightly shorten the time. After stepping down from the arena, reporters from various newspapers competed to take photos of them. As for the athletes, they were all able to obey the order and follow the rules, which was especially commendable. It is fortunate for the future of national arts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the rain yesterday, some competitors withdrew from the competition. It is now scheduled to continue the competition starting at 1 PM this afternoon. Those who did not compete yesterday are expected to arrive by 12 noon. If they do not appear today, their participation will be considered a forfeit. Please take note.</p>
<h3>5,000-Meter Race Walking Performance: Shi Jinsheng First</h3>
<p>Since winning the Shanghai International Race Walking Championship, practicing race walking has become a popular trend. Furthermore, under the guidance of Shi Junyouhui, the organization of the Race Walking Association has been well-structured, and practice has been consistent and methodical, resulting in rapid progress. Yesterday, the result of the 5,000-meter performance at the track and field was that Shi Jinsheng won first place with a time of 26 minutes, 32 and 2/5 seconds. Looking at Shi's posture, it was unified from beginning to end, which was quite impressive. Compared to his posture in the previous two International Race Walking events, it has improved significantly. The postures of Zhang Zaojiu in second place and Hou Genren in third place were also quite good, but their thigh muscles were not as strong as Shi Jinsheng's, so their pace rate was slower. Xie Xingdao in fourth place had very small steps, and although his speed was extremely fast, it ultimately felt disadvantageous. The four people who achieved positions were all veterans of the Chinese race walking team. It is hoped that everyone will continue to work hard, not only to have a good performance at the National Games, but also to maintain the championship at this year's International Race Walking and win glory for China. The rankings and results of yesterday's performance are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Shi Jinsheng</p>
<p>Second: Zhang Zaojiu</p>
<p>Third: Hou Genren</p>
<p>Fourth: Xie Xingdao</p>
<p>Time: 26 minutes, 32 and 2/5 seconds</p>
<h3>Volleyball and Tennis Matches Not Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Women's volleyball semi-finals rescheduled for 2 PM today. Yesterday afternoon, due to heavy rain, no men's tennis matches were held. The two women's tennis semi-final matches were also postponed to 2 PM this afternoon due to rain. Basketball matches will be held as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Women's 50-Meter Re-run</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for 2 PM on the 19th. The women's 50-meter race, except for the first place, will be re-run. The organizing committee sent letters to Ms. Ma Yufang, Situ Wei, Xue Qiding, and Li Baohui, to be held yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, but none of them arrived at the designated time. It is suspected that the letters were mailed out and could not be received on time. Therefore, Shen Siliang, the competition director, decided to reschedule it for this Saturday (the 19th) at 2 PM.</p>

<p>Original national record held by Ma Zhihui, time: 3 minutes, 28 seconds.</p>
<p>The municipal sports meet swimming competition continued last night at the Jiaotong University swimming pool. The athletes were all in high spirits due to the finals, seeking the final victory. Therefore, the competition in each event was more intense than the previous day, attracting hundreds of spectators in the entire venue, who stretched their necks and watched with great interest. Among them, the 200-meter breaststroke was the most exciting. When the announcer reported the results of this event, the sound of cheers from the entire venue shook the building, as Ling Chongju had set a new national record. The competition situation is attached as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Competition Overview</p>
<p>Men's and Women's 50-meter Freestyle: The first event on the order list was the 50-meter freestyle competition. From the start to the end, Yin Yanjun and Lian Xiannan competed for first place, swimming side by side. At the final point, the two were only inches apart, but Yin Yanjun ultimately took the lead.</p>
<p>200-meter Breaststroke: One of the most exciting events of the night. Five splashes of water scattered, and only five human frogs could be seen bravely advancing. At the 150-meter mark, the top two were less than three meters apart. By the time they reached the finish line, Ling Chongxue had surpassed Yu Rongji by more than 25 meters, and Ling's posture was perfect, creating a new national record, which is truly a celebratory event.</p>
<p>Women's 100-meter Breaststroke: Ms. Gong Xiji performed a solo act, which was a unique scene in the competition.</p>
<p>Diving: Yu Rongji and Zhou Xuanguang were the best. Each jump and leap was full of tricks and looked very interesting. As a result of the competition, Yu won one point more than Zhou.</p>
<p>1,500-meter Freestyle: In this event, when turning after the 25-meter mark, the top two pushed forward at the same time, and the competition was extremely fierce. As a result, Lin Chaoyuan took the lead, followed by Chen Yuquan. When they reached the finish line, the two were only five inches apart.</p>
<p>100-meter Freestyle: Lian Xiannan and Yin Yanjun chased each other, advancing side by side. Yin passed Lian in the last lap. Although Lian was good at using the turn, he was ultimately defeated by Yin's remaining energy in the last few seconds.</p>

<p>Sets a new national record in the triple jump</p>
<p>Outperforms Wang Jihuai in the long jump</p>
<p>Fuzhou News Agency reports that the Fujian preliminary round for the National Games is actively being planned and carried out. The Sports Association, in order to select outstanding talents from the Fuzhou people to prepare for participation in the preliminary round, held a public sports meet at the Provincial Public Sports Field. Schools, groups, or individuals who participated were quite enthusiastic. Cheng Shizhui, Director of Education, also personally guided the event, and the sports results were very good. Zhang Xiangqing achieved a high jump result of 1.60 meters and a long jump result of 6.66 meters, outperforming Wang Jihuai, who had the best long jump result this year (Wang Jun jumped 6.64 meters at the Jiangnan University sports meet, which was the best result of the year). His high and low hurdles results were also good. His triple jump even broke the national record of 13.73 meters held by Situ Guang with a record of 14 meters, attracting attention from all walks of life. Zhang is from Longxi, Fujian, and studied at Waseda University in Japan. He usually works hard on sports training. When the university held sports events in Japan, he ranked second individually.

<h3>The Back Waves Urge the Front Waves: A Record of the Ups and Downs of Dongda Athletes in Recent Years</h3>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) Since the 14th North China Games of that year, Northeastern University has leaped to become the leader of domestic track and field. In the past three years, its glory has been brilliant, shining throughout China. It has consistently and steadily won championships in various competitions, both large and small, with its substantial strength. However, during this period, meritorious officials retired after achieving fame, and new talents emerged to the forefront. Several generations of back waves pushed the front waves, and the overall situation has undergone several ups and downs.</p>
<p>Sprints: In the North China campaign of that year, the main sprinter was Mr. Liu Changchun. Mr. Liu is still holding his position, but unfortunately, his strength may not be as good as before. Later, Dongte Teng Ruilin (who won the first place in the North China Junior 100m and 200m) transferred in, and then it developed even better. I remember once, Mr. Liu won first place with 10.8 seconds (in an ordinary small sports meeting), while Teng won second place with 11.1 seconds, which can be said to be rare. However, later, at the National Games, Teng was completely defeated due to lack of practice, and Liu also regressed due to a leg injury.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 19th year, Teng dropped out of school. At the same time, Mr. Li Yuezhou transferred in again. Li is a sprint expert, so he made up for Teng's vacancy. In the same year, in the Four Provinces Joint Games, he only lost to the "Flying General" by one step in the 100m race.</p>
<p>However, things change rapidly. Li also dropped out of school this summer, presumably to graduate. It is said that he is now working in the Tianjin military. At this time, Wu Jingyao, a leader in the North China junior sprints, was admitted. Mr. Wu has excellent physical fitness and will be able to achieve great accomplishments in the future.</p>
<p>Middle Distance: As for the middle distance, it was mainly led by Jiang Yunlong and Wang Xuanji in the early years, supplemented by Xue Yuxiang and Pang Shirong. At that time, at the North China Games, Wang won the 800m championship, and Jiang Yunlong, Chen Fengsheng, Xue and Pang monopolized the 1500m and won the beautiful name of the Four Horsemen. Before long, Chen Fengsheng dropped out of school first, followed by Pang, who also dropped out of school last year. Wang Xuanji's heyday has passed. Emerging players such as Wang Mingshen, Yu Xiwei, Wang Shaoye, Ma Degang, Zhang Baoxiang, and Liu Guxue have all surpassed him. So, Wang fell to become a 400m runner, and then fell to become a 200m runner. Xue Yuxiang unfortunately suffered from tonsillitis at the beginning of this year and rested for about a quarter. During the summer vacation, he unfortunately suffered from a leg disease again. He has been plagued by illnesses many times, and his ambition has been exhausted.</p>
<p>Long Distance: In the early years, the main long-distance runner was Jiang Yunlong. Jiang won the first place in the 1500m, 5000m, and 10000m at the North China Games. However, the 10000m was not his specialty, so after Zhao Dexin (also known as Zhao Mingsan) from Dalian came to the school, Jiang withdrew from the top spot in the 10000m and gave way to him. (In the National Games the following year, Zhao showed his power and made the people of the country deeply recognize the "Old Zhao" of the Northeast. However, unfortunately, Heaven was jealous of talent. When Old Zhao was ambitious and ready to go to Shanghai (to participate in the Far Eastern Games), he suffered a sudden illness due to participating in a 17-mile marathon. So, he watched others set off for the meeting, while he was trapped in illness for more than two months. By the time he recovered, he was as thin as firewood and dared not think about sports again in this life. Looking back on the past, it was nothing more than a heroic dream.</p>
<p>After Zhao retired, there was a lack of talent in the Northeast for a time. Therefore, in the Four Provinces Joint Games of that year, Liu Guxue of Dongte took advantage of the opportunity. However, unexpectedly, in the winter of that year, Liu Guxue also drifted into Dongda University, where everyone hopes. So, the long-distance world of Dongda was restored, and now Zhang Yongming has made considerable progress. It is expected that he will become a master soon.</p>
<p>Hurdles: As for the hurdles, there is no major change. The high hurdles are still Xiao Dinghua's specialty, but Zhang Lingjia is not willing to stay behind forever, and there has been a fierce competition recently. Also, the low hurdles have been changed to middle hurdles, so recently, there are many speculators who are committed to this item.</p>
<p>Jumping: In the early years, Xiao Dinghua was regarded as the leader of the jumping world, so he was also known as the Flying Grasshopper. But after the North China Games, Chuan Baorui from Dalian transferred in. This gentleman is tall and strong, and the three jumps (high jump, long jump, triple jump) are all his strengths. Now, except for the triple jump, the first two are still managed by the students.</p>
<p>Throwing: In the throwing world, Wen Jiufeng and Fan Guangwu, the two major North China shot putters, went to Germany and retired halfway (the so-called halfway retirement means giving up their athlete rights and not doing it, but occasionally they are happy to try it). Now, only Zhang Lingjia is trying it. Zhang was proficient in the three iron (shot put, discus, javelin), but due to the unfortunate fracture of his right arm, he gave up his promising javelin and did not do it. As for his heart, he still yearns for it. Zhang's discus can now be called a talent in China, and his decathlon is even more outstanding.</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government is Planning to Block the Breach in the Canal</h3>
<p>Using Soil from Zhenjiang Area</p>
<p>Regarding the blocking of the Jiangbei Canal Dike, it is said that the four places of Dangjun Building, Miaoxiangkou, Hehua Pond, and Zhaoguan Dam are the most important. However, according to experienced river workers, it is difficult to grab and block due to the inability to obtain soil. Later, after Jiangbei fellow villager Shen Zhuowu and Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ye Chucang and others discussed, they hired Hua Engineering Engineer Zhuo Jing San and others and foreign engineers Gerk and others to inspect on the 10th of this month. After the inspection, a suitable method has been drafted. It will take about two months from the start of construction to complete the blocking. As for the soil collection, it is said that Shen Zhuowu has drafted a method and submitted it to Chairman Ye for approval. It is expected that a large amount of soil and stone will be transported from the soil mountains in Zhenjiang and Qixia Longtan and other places for application. Mr. Shen has come to Shanghai yesterday with Chinese and foreign engineers to rush to handle all the necessary items for transportation to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on Disaster Relief in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member Gao Yihan</p>
<p>Report on Inspection of Disaster Situation in Jiangbei</p>
<p>In order to understand the truth of the Jiangbei flood, the Supervisory Yuan specially sent Supervisory Committee member Gao Yihan to conduct an on-site inspection. He has now returned to Zhenjiang and will continue to inspect along the Jinghu Road. Yesterday, he sent a special letter to Xu Shiying, saying: Mr. Junren, I was ordered to inspect the flood situation in Jiangsu Province this time. I know that the disaster situation in Jiangbei is the most serious. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, I first arrived in Zhenjiang. On the 4th, I went north from Guazhou, passing through Shaobo, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an to Qingjiangpu. There are a total of 26 breaches along the way, with a total length of more than 800 zhang. Wherever the flood passed, the fields and houses were in ruins. The victims on both sides cried for help. The disaster situation in Gaoyou and Shaobo was especially tragic. Although the relief agencies and charitable organizations have released emergency relief, the disaster area is vast and there are many victims, making it difficult to reach everyone. During the visit along the dike, some people only have one meal a day, some only get one or two pieces of bread, and even some have nothing to eat all day long. Seeing this situation, it is difficult to continue. If funds are raised in the disaster area, the financial resources of each county are also insufficient. Woe to these survivors who do not die on the day the dike collapses, but die when the flood recedes. My heart is hurt and I am extremely worried. Therefore, when I returned to Shaobo, I sent a telegram on behalf of the victims to appeal to all parties for help, so that the victims in the disaster area would not be interrupted in their food supply. On the 8th, I went east from Shaobo along Xie Fenggang, intending to go to Xinghua by small steamer. When I passed Qiaoshu Town, I could not distinguish the river channel. The flood was vast and boundless. The water was five or six feet deep in the flat ground. The villages and houses were submerged, and there was no sign of human habitation in the wilderness. Even if there were residents, they were also sleeping in the open air between the dikes and on the trees. The remaining houses only had a few wooden pillars supporting a roof. The relief providers here were even rarer. As soon as they saw the small steamer passing by, they would steer small boats to carry the old and young to gather on the side of the steamer, crying for hunger and food. The small steamer I was on ran aground five or six times in the middle because it could not distinguish the waterway. Each time, there were four small boats gathering to beg us for relief. The more they gathered, the more they became. When I told them that this was a ship for inspecting the disaster, they all left with tears in their eyes. This situation cannot be fully depicted by even the drawings of refugees. On the morning of the 9th, I went to Taixian via the large culvert from Qiaoshu Town. I learned that the county was almost the same as Xinghua, and the disaster area reached more than two-thirds. I originally intended to go to Dongtai again, but I stopped because I could not distinguish the river channel along the way. According to the investigation, the counties of Xingtai and Dong were almost all lakes. The number of victims cannot be determined accurately, but if the relief funds do not arrive in a few days, I am afraid that the relief providers will only sit and wait for the victims to starve to death. Before arriving in the disaster area, I suspected that the disaster reports were exaggerated, but after experiencing it myself, I felt that the reports did not reach one in ten thousand of the actual situation. The cooked food transported from distant places is mostly rotten and inedible. However, if raw grain is transported, there is no dry firewood to cook it. If money is given for relief, there is no place to buy food. Seeing this situation, there is a strong desire to provide relief, but the inability to provide relief. What to do? The relief providers are worried every day that the relief supplies will not continue to arrive, making it difficult to cook without rice. I can only beg you to publicize the truth here to the charitable organizations at sea. The arrival of relief supplies one day earlier will save the lives of countless victims. I urgently express my words, and I respectfully wish you peace and health. Gao Yihan bowed and said on the 10th.</p>
<p>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Xuzhou: The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association recently received a letter from Qiu Jun, a relief worker in Tongshan, saying that the disaster situation in Xuzhou is also very serious. The areas on both sides of Weishan Lake are the most serious. The miscellaneous grains such as beans, peanuts, and sesame have not been harvested at all. Even the sorghum harvested in the spring is less than 40% of the total harvest. In the past, when there were famines, the victims would flee to the south of the Yangtze River. This year, the disaster has spread across the country, and the victims have no way to escape. According to this situation, there will be 200,000 people who cannot live due to the disaster by winter. If it is not until the next spring, when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available, the number will be even more unimaginable. The old and weak will turn to the ravines, and the strong will take risks. It is worrying everywhere. It is urgent to establish porridge factories and shelters. The association has now asked Qiao Mengqian to go to provide relief.</p>
<p>Relief Work in Yangzhou: Another telegram from the Yangzhou office said: Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, Yihan, Yisan, Jian, Mei Tongzhou and Xu Er brothers, Zhen, carried a large amount of relief supplies to the Gongdao Bridge and other places in Shui Ba Xiang to provide relief. After passing through more than 60 villages, no matter men, women, old or young, they all cried bitterly when they saw us. They used planks and leaned on trees for their homes. They had no clothes or blankets in the cold night. They suffered from dysentery and malaria. They were emaciated and haggard. All kinds of tragic situations made us want to cry without tears. On the way to You, we will return to Yangzhou tomorrow. Mei bowed, its behalf,</p>
<h3>Two Letters Describing the Disaster in Xinghua</h3>
<p>The Xinghua Fellow Villagers Association recently received two letters copied from Nantong, describing the heartbreaking and unbearable disaster in Xinghua. The contents are as follows: (1) To the two Zhang County Magistrates, Han, Uncle Yi County Magistrate, Cijian, I am grateful for your county's repeated dispatch of personnel to Xing to distribute emergency relief and rescue the refugees. Your kindness is immeasurable. Unfortunately, our county has suffered this great calamity. The disaster area covers an area of 7,200 square miles. The loss of fields, houses, and property is no less than 10,000,000 yuan. Corpses float along the river, and countless people have died. The surviving victims are climbing trees and roofs, urgently waiting to be rescued. In addition to the life-saving efforts of your county and the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, according to reports, there are still tens of thousands of dying victims in the four villages who cannot survive. The situation is unbearable. We are currently telegraphing the provincial government to requisition a large number of ships and carry dry food for rapid relief. At the same time, we are asking various charitable organizations in China and abroad to immediately release relief funds to save lives. We still hope that the county magistrate and all legal groups will have compassion and consider the serious disaster situation in our county, widely publicize it, and find ways to provide relief. We are extremely grateful. Thank you specially. Respectfully wish you peace. Xinghua County Temporary Disaster Relief Association Standing Committee Shi Mingyong, Qi (2) To Nantong Fellow Villager Wang Jun, Letter, Xu Bai Mr. Jian, The current flood disaster in Xingyi is extremely tragic. Since the breaches in You and Shao, the water level has suddenly increased by several feet. The deep ones are more than a zhang, and the shallow ones are up to the knees. The city and the countryside are the same. It is impossible to find a few square feet of dry land to live in. The houses along the river outside the city are all collapsing due to the impact of the wind and waves. It is shocking to see, such as the Dawang Temple, Prajna Nunnery, Guanyin Pavilion, Chenghuang Xing Palace, Yeguandi Temple, Zhunti Nunnery, etc. outside the north city, all of which are solid and tall houses, and almost all of them have been demolished. Others can be imagined. In the countryside, no matter where the houses are, they have all been swept away by the water. Not only are furniture and property lost, but also food has been washed away. There are people who are drowned, starved to death, and desperately seeking death everywhere. The exact number is still unknown. Such a great calamity has never been heard of in ancient times. We are temporarily in local positions and try our best to fulfill our responsibilities. I really don't know where to start. I am very grateful to the disaster relief team of your county for bringing a large amount of relief supplies and distributing them. Mr. Mang also took 250 victims back to Tong to accommodate them. I am especially grateful to County Magistrate Zhang and the local legal groups for their kindness in saving lives thoroughly. Please trouble Mr. Quan to thank them all on my behalf. However, the land is vast, the victims are numerous, and the future is long. The water has not yet receded, and the people's livelihood has no chance of turning around. The dead before and after are afraid that they will still not be spared. Every time I think about it, I can only cry bitterly. The tragic situation of the disaster is beyond description. I briefly describe a few lines, hoping that you will understand. I wish you a safe journey. Your brother Gu Lunan, Qi, September 7th (Gu is the chairman of the Xinghua Chamber of Commerce.)</p>
<h3>Cao Deliang Talks About the Disaster Situation in Taixian</h3>
<p>Cao Deliang, chairman of the Taixian Chamber of Commerce, came to Shanghai on business. According to his words yesterday, it rained heavily in Taixian in July. The southeast and southwest areas are originally high in terrain. Due to the continuous heavy rain, the water stagnated and was difficult to recede, and there were signs of being flooded. The northern villages are all paddy fields, so even if there is a little more rainfall, it will not be a big problem. However, people's hearts are already uneasy. At the beginning of August, the Cheluo Wuli Xinba Sanba opened at the same time, and the west water flowed down. The water level in the lower river rose sharply, and most of the northern villages were flooded. The people in the Xiefenggang area were already flooded in their homes, so they gathered to live on the dikes. Unexpectedly, a sudden storm arose, drumming up the raging waves. The Xiedi, which was known to be solid, suddenly collapsed. The people who were living on the dike were unable to escape and were all swept into the flood by the huge waves. The number of deaths could not be counted. When the breaches in Gao and Shao occurred, Taixian rose by three feet again. The deepest place was more than the top of the head, and the shallowest place was also two or three feet. The four districts of Gangzi, Fanchuan, Bantun, and Xiaoji were completely submerged in the water. The Taicheng originally had a disaster prevention committee, but it was reorganized into a flood relief committee and quickly carried out relief. They hired small steamships to go to the villages to rescue the victims. At the same time, private philanthropists also hired ships to rescue them. However, the disaster area was too wide, making it difficult to rescue everyone from the water. As for the collapse of houses and the snatching of rice, which was washed away and no longer existed, it should be the meaning in the topic. Now, the work of the relief committee members is extremely intense. Under the committee, there are ten groups: general affairs, accounting, condolences, supervision, life-saving, transportation, health, accommodation of victims, purchase of farming cattle, and food management, each with one person responsible for presiding over. I am in charge of the work of the accommodation of victims group, with a total of ten shelters, with 5,000 victims. The victims from Xinghua, Dongtai, and other villages in our county are still coming in an endless stream. Limited by funding, it is not easy to accommodate them all. At present, the water level has not receded slightly. Two-thirds of the county's land is submerged in water. There are at least 200,000 victims struggling in the water waiting to die. Those in the shallower places can barely survive. There are hundreds of thousands of victims waiting for relief. The urban area is high, and fortunately, it has not been completely submerged. However, the basket shop outside the north gate has water up to the ankles, gradually deepening to the north. Looking north from the end of the city, it is a vast expanse of water. Those who go to inspect only see that the most prosperous area of Pozi Street has not changed its old appearance, and think that the disaster situation in Taixian is not serious, which is a big mistake. Cao also talked about relief, saying that two-thirds of the land in Taixian is submerged, and there are the most serious and tragic four districts of Gangzi, Potun, Fanchuan, and Xiaoji. There are too many victims, and it is impossible to provide relief with the tens of thousands of yuan raised locally. Even with 200,000 victims waiting to die, each person would need one yuan, which would require 200,000 yuan. Ask what good is it to give each person one yuan? Therefore, the provincial government must have concrete measures and a large amount of relief funds, and must conduct a careful investigation and distribute them on the ground before it can be effective. Moreover, the already breached breach has not been blocked, and the old course to the sea cannot be smoothly discharged. If Gao and Shao recede by one point, then Tai, Xing, and Dong will increase by one point.

<h3>Shanghai County Government Encourages the Donation of Old Clothes for Victims</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday issued an order to the county's various agencies, saying: According to the document and telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, this year, the disaster-stricken area of this province has reached almost nine-tenths, and the counties along the canal are especially tragic. Regarding the accommodation and relief, this government has been actively preparing and implementing it in order. However, it is the time of late autumn, and the severe cold is approaching. The item of clothing for the victims should also be prepared in advance. In addition to sending separate telegrams to the Commander-in-Chief and ordering the Civil Affairs Department and the Security Department to quickly allocate broken and old clothes used by the military police to this government for transfer and assistance, it is necessary to send a telegram to the county magistrate to quickly announce to all sectors that anyone who has stored old clothes for men and women, whether men, women, old or young, single cotton, silk, or cloth, should donate as much as possible. Hand them over to the county government for transfer to the relief association for distribution. Also, immediately gather the heads of the districts, villages, and towns and their deputies to be responsible for encouraging donations, so that the victims can obtain tools to keep out the cold. The time is urgent, and there should be no delay. It is important, etc. Upon receiving this, it was submitted for discussion at the 73rd county political meeting on the 14th of this month, and it was decided to issue a notice to all agencies to collect old clothes within ten days and hand them over to the county for transfer, etc. In addition to complying with the notice and sending it to the departments, it is also ordered to comply with it, quickly collect old clothes for men and women, and hand them over to the county within ten days for collection and transfer.

<h3>Disaster Relief Work of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>Rushing to Make Cotton Clothes: The association, in view of the increasing cold weather and the victims without clothes, is rushing to make 30,000 sets of cotton clothes for distribution. However, local coarse cloth is no longer available for purchase. It has specially ordered it from Nantong Tiansheng No. 1 Factory. It will be shipped out soon. However, the cost of new clothes is more expensive, and it is still difficult to meet the urgent needs. If all sectors have old clothes and quilts, rather than storing them in the attic and occupying space, why not donate them to the victims, so that they can create infinite blessings?</p>
<p>Shipping out Flour: The 10,000 bags of flour purchased by the association for the Yangzhou branch have been loaded by the Datong Shipping Company and are allowed to be shipped out today. The company has also agreed to load them for free.</p>

<h3>Confused State of Financial Specie Market</h3>
<p>Spot Futures Almost Flat: Yesterday, the 15th, the state of the specie market was confusing, with no firm grasp. The industry's intentions were hesitant, and the supply and demand varied. There were a total of eight taels of retrospect throughout the day, with only a two-cent increase at the end. This was due to a slight drop in the silver market. The opening price rose slightly, but many parties suddenly sold, causing it to weaken. As the foreign exchange market eased and leveled off, hedging and Cantonese banks continued to buy, slightly pushing it higher. However, there were constant advances and retreats, hovering between 71 and 72 taels. A sudden storm arose in the after-market. Dealers had pre-sold futures which according to regulation had to be settled today (16th), but the exchange had dissuaded this without success, and shorts were indeed posting, the opposite of the previous session. Initially at 2.7 taels, general longs were willing to trade out, Hengxing, Yifeng, Yongheng etc. As a result, it became increasingly cheaper, almost flat, with many transactions being carried out by Dalian shorts etc., causing panic, breaking the 750 tael barrier, especially as sellers were more than usual, collapsing to 66 taels and change. Because of the futures market returning, it was necessary to calculate 1.7 or 1.8 taels, and as buyers were still strong, it soared, again passing 70 taels. Ultimately in these futures market noises, a change will happen.</p>
<p>Several Changes in the Morning: From the morning's opening of the October contract with a slight increase of five cents, at 773.2 taels, large bars fell by only .0625 in the near term, and did not change in the far term. The price of silver fell by one-eighth, private small deals fell by three-sixteenths, and US stocks also fell by more than one or two yuan. Subsequently, it increased to 74.4 taels, but the large holders Yongheng, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong etc. sold, so it was difficult to stand, and it fell to 70.08 taels. When British gold was announced as unchanged, small households entered slightly, so it added a few cents, to 71.45 taels, but Tongtaichang, Senchangyong, Yongrichang etc. did not forget to sell, and it immediately fell to 69.5 taels. Domestic British gold was flat, banks ate December at 1.30625, and November could enter and exit at the same price. Soon Shanghai bought far-term at 1.25, causing the price of gold to hover around 70 taels. After 10 o'clock, Hengxing, Yuanmao Yong etc. came to buy, and the British gold price recovered well, Zhengjin etc. absorbed December at .0625, with the market price gradually increasing by over three taels, up to 72.9 taels at 11 o'clock. Later, Yongheng etc. continued to sell, slightly less than two taels. At midday it was 71 taels, but not too much change. It was heard that Indian remittances were large to Thana, and the far term was slightly less to Thana, and the midday closing was 71.4 taels, the posted price still calculated at 790.02 taels, a premium of around 20 taels, and around 19 taels at midday.</p>
<p>Chaotic Situation in the After-Market: The after-market opened at 71 taels, because Yongheng sold again, falling to 69.3. It then rose to 70.02 taels, and Mitsui took a Japanese gold of 1.61875 taels, Zhengjin took British gold for January at .0625 to 1.25. Later, because futures were opened, prices also gradually decreased, and all numbers in the market were selling, causing a sudden fall, ultimately reaching 66.2 taels at 3 o'clock, causing considerable fear. Later, banks directly bought British gold .0625, Zhifengyong Qianchang Xiangyongfeng contested to come to cover, so it jumped two taels in an instant, with one tael turning. After 3:30, the futures market increased again, and a certain bank also contributed, and at 4:20 it rose to 73.7 taels. At this time, Changsheng Yongqian Changxiang etc. bought more, but Dalian banks were unwilling to give up, and returned to 2.45 taels. At 4:30, the closing was 72.9 taels, only increasing two cents compared to the previous day. After the market closed, it rose to more than 3.5 taels, because materials and Guangdong banks dragged in, but Gully etc. sold again, suppressing it to 3.1 taels. By the end of the day, the maximum was 74.4 taels, the minimum was 66.2 taels, a difference of 8.2 taels.</p>
<p>Few Cash Transactions: The early market for materials was 73.3 taels, midday closed at one tael, afternoon one tael, closing at four taels, posted price calculated at around 20 taels, later 17 taels before and after, logged as October at 71 taels. This month is already clearly concluded, replenishment water at 68 taels, 70 taels in the afternoon, and the cash red bar is level, estimated less than plus 7.75 taels, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Industry Ins and Outs: Trading on the table was complicated. Statistically Yuanmao Yong, Dayoucheng, Hengxing, Huachang Yong, Fuchang etc. all entered, and Tongtaichang, Shunli, Zhifengyong, Yongheng, Yongfeng, Senchangyong, Yuancheng, Yifengyong, Ritchang all exited. Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Daxingyong, Hengyu etc. entered and exited in different quantities.

Guangdong longs added code about two thousand several hundred bars.</p>

The HSBC listing in Shanghai was no different from the previous afternoon after it changed. Only the German exchange rate increased by half a yuan, to 128 marks, and Hong Kong increased by .0625, calculated as 80 taels. Internally in the bank, the morning and evening were level, but with slight hovering, and briefly saw easing. The ultimate price was the same as the previous day, with the city hovering around 770 taels. The futures were pre-privately opened, and indeed the shorts were posting. Chinese merchants traded relatively actively, with British gold transactions totaling about 200,000 pounds, which was the release of gold companies. The bank was still able to collect, and hedging was almost leveled, so the price of gold failed to rise. Also, the US dollar was only transacted in two or three hundred thousand yuan, but the Japanese dollar was sold by Dalian banks to the Japanese Merchant Bank for more than one million yuan. The market situation had no special honor or disgrace.</p>

<h3>Mysterious and Difficult Money Market</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's money market situation was moderately tight, with slight ups and downs, a mysterious and confusing situation, and not much trivial settlement. As for the external situation, supply and demand were also weak. Although the commercial needs should be urgent in the mid-autumn season, they are far less prosperous than in the past, indicating that commercial demand has been weak everywhere due to this year's natural disasters. It can be seen that for the sake of prudence in the current scope of operation in the financial sector, the restrictions are generally tight, so there is nothing particularly surprising to say.</p>
<p>Interest Rates: (Silver interest) The early morning interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, and the midday rate was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 7 hao and a half, roughly the same trend as the previous day.

The trading volume was 85,000 jiao in the early market and 15,000 jiao in the midday market. Copper coins were changed to 500 more characters, to 372,500 characters.</p>

It is estimated that over 10.06 million were transacted in the morning market, and about 4.5 million in the after-market, totaling over 15.1 million yuan. Among them, the salt tax was still the most popular, and the unified tax 20 customs share also accounted for a large amount. The trend was slightly more stable than the previous day. All parties bought at low prices, and the prices were more solid than before. Except for a rather sluggish opening in the early morning, the prices gradually rose later. As a result, the biggest increase compared to the previous day was in the salt tax for September, which reached 1.6 yuan. The October futures and the 1930 Bonds also increased by about one yuan, and others also increased by 3 or 4 jiao or so.

<h3>Mediocre Situation in Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat again. Because the overseas cotton yarn situation is only inclined to go upstream, the current situation is quite prosperous, making people's hearts weaker. However, a large number of new offerings are relatively lacking, due to the floor price relationship. However, the surrounding environment is very bad, so the major shorts remain unmoved. As for the longs, their attitude is calm, so the overall trend does not deviate from a fluctuating pattern.</p>
<p>People's Standard Dropped Two, Three, and Four Cents: The People's Standard market opened, with the price of US cotton 3-grade yarn all dropping, and the atmosphere was relatively flat. The fine yarn price dropped by 1.2 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the cotton market was easing, with a looser situation, each dropping by 1, 2, 3, and 4 cents. The trading volume was estimated at 10,500 bales. It was found that Hengde sold 550 bales, Yi Da 300 bales, Shen Ji 300 bales, and Shen Xin 300 bales. Yi Yu bought 1,200 bales, Yu Da 550 bales, Tong Yu 400 bales, and Hou Feng 400 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Price - Increase/Decrease - Inventory Balance</p>
<p>September 153.4 - Down - 346,150 - December 151.7 - Down - 194,800</p>
<p>October 152.7 - - 14,500 - January 151.5 - - 74,900</p>
<p>November 152.0 - - 391,510 - February 151.5 - - 239,750</p>
<p>1,000 Bales of Yarn Sales: The sales of existing yarn are still good. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day. 10 bales were traded between colleagues, and the market was flat. Among the customer gangs, Tianjin bought 100 bales, Guangdong 165 bales, Shantou 105 bales, North Gang 55 bales, inland 100 bales, Sichuan 340 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 150 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Relapses into Slump</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning but declined in the afternoon, with a relatively weak trend. In reality, foreign cotton prices continued to fall. Furthermore, various factories purchased large quantities of cheap American and Indian cotton, causing increasing panic among people. The market conditions deteriorated rapidly. However, due to the worsening weather in this port and the damage to cotton fields, most cotton merchants still held long positions. The global cotton situation is very pessimistic. As for speculators, they are holding their short positions firmly.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Price Falls Below Four Taels Threshold</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard price on the exchange opened in the morning session. Although American cotton had been declining, due to poor weather, prices for all months rose slightly by five points. In the afternoon, news of large-scale foreign cotton transactions caused the market to weaken suddenly, with each price falling by 2.5 cents. The total volume of transactions was 61,300 piculs. According to investigations, Yu Chang sold 3,400 piculs, Tian Long 1,800 piculs, and Yuan De 1,800 piculs. Da Fu bought 1,100 piculs, De Ji 2,900 piculs, Ji Feng 1,400 piculs, Ming De 1,100 piculs, and Shen Chang 1,500 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Yarn Plummets Universally</h3>
<p>American Cotton Sold Off in the South</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton weakened due to a lack of major buyers, sell-offs in the South, and a downturn on Wall Street. Futures fell by 4-7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 5-6 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton softened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and talks by the Governor-General about increasing taxes to restore fiscal balance. Pingguoer and Oumula fell by 3 rupees, and Bai Luodan fell by 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 14th):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market in the Lower Reaches of the River Strengthens Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Southern Market</p>
<p>The supply from various groups remains low. Yesterday's market was further tightened due to the rain. Retail sales of fresh goods in urban and rural stores were still strong, while wholesale merchants were unhealthy. The demand from outside the city was good, causing the price of thick japonica and thin indica rice to rise by 2 jiao. Although there were not many foreign superior goods, transactions between the dealers and the local street were sluggish, and the market remained stable. New japonica rice was still sporadic, with normal consumption, and large fluctuations of about 2 chi were observed.</p>
<p>New Wharf</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were over 20 suppliers. River cargo customers insisted on not selling unless prices rose. Prices in inland areas such as Changshu and Yixing exceeded those in Shanghai by 6-7 jiao. Due to the cost pressures on the customers and the heavy rain, although transactions were not brisk, the market trend improved, and prices rose by 1-2 jiao. The arrival of green-tip rice remained scarce, with no demand. Glutinous rice was stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Prices Fall and Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Taizhou rice down 0.1 jiao, small assorted rice down 0.2 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrivals surge, overseas telegrams also show slight decrease.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market unanimously declined due to the surge in arrivals and the slight decrease in overseas quotations. Foreign firms offered No. 1 Saigon rice for October delivery at only 6.7 taels, with hopes of further approval. Furthermore, rice orders for August had already arrived in succession, and orders for September would also arrive gradually. According to foreign merchants, most of the September orders, totaling over 200,000 bags, could arrive in Shanghai within the next ten days. Therefore, cargo owners and foreign firms were actively selling, and prices were willingly reduced. After the price reduction, local hoarding merchants inquired, and actual sales increased due to the cheap prices. The market became active again. However, spot prices for small-pattern rice were down by 0.2 jiao, and September contracts were down by a significant 0.1 qian. Taizhou rice and pattern rice were each down by a small amount. Approximately 5,000 bags of spot small-pattern rice were sold at prices ranging from 13 yuan to 12.75 yuan, and 200 tons for September delivery were priced at 6.2 taels. 200 bags of Mindang rice were priced at 13 yuan, and over 200 bags of Taizhou rice were priced at 12.8 yuan to 12.2 yuan, with inferior quality at 11.9 yuan. Coarse rice was priced at 11 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Relapses into Weakness in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, scattered merchants and inland groups bought in response to foreign wheat telegrams reporting a 0.2-0.3 increase, and prices for both near-term and far-term months rose by 0.1-0.2 points. However, the appetite of importers was limited, and brokers and large long-position holders wanted to take advantage of the rally to cash out, so the market was unable to rally. Although the volume of transactions was higher in the afternoon than in the morning, prices fell instead. The closing price for September was down 0.1 point, October was unchanged, November was down 0.1 point, December and January were unchanged, and February was up 0.1 point. Both arriving and stored wheat were available, but factory demand remained sluggish, and the market was weak. Yesterday, Huafeng Factory handled over 1,000 bags of wheat from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Flour from Northern Groups Cashes Out in the Near Term</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday, manufacturers did not sell off, and actual sales customers did not inquire. The market was unusually quiet, and transactions were scarce, a stark contrast to the prosperity of the past few months. However, the morning opening reports of increases of around 0.3 yuan attracted scattered merchants and inland customers to buy in. Inland customers paid more attention to distant months, so prices for all months rose. However, as foreign groups saw sluggish actual sales in the area, they actively cashed out near-term contracts, and the market was dragged down again. The final result was a decrease of 0.25 cents for September, unchanged for October, a decrease of 0.5 cents for November, a decrease of 0.25 cents for December, an increase of 7.5 cents for January, and an increase of 2.5 cents for February.</p>
<h3>Wujin Autumn Cocoons Have 60% Maturity</h3>
<p>The cocoon quality is also good... The highest cocoon price reached 80 yuan.</p>
<p>In the cities and villages under the jurisdiction of Wujin County, most farmers raised autumn silkworms this year. The silkworm eggs hatched well, and the weather was suitable after hatching, leading to smooth development. However, during the major molt, continuous autumn rains and cold weather affected the silkworms, resulting in white muscardine and softening diseases, causing losses of 30-40%. Early cocoons have already entered the market, and late cocoons are also ready to be spun. Overall, they have 60% maturity. Cocoon shops have been open for four days, with prices being raised and competed for. The cocoon quality is good, and the highest cocoon price has reached 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Coarse Cloth, and Coarse Twill Sales Suddenly Surge</h3>
<p>Due to the active distribution of clothing.</p>
<p>Piece goods...due to the severe flooding in various provinces, sales are cleared, reaching... Among the soft cotton cloths, light-weight coarse cloth and coarse twill are quite active, already showing signs of... Because large quantities of disaster relief funds have been collected and are being shipped out, charitable individuals who donate cotton clothing are also unusually enthusiastic. The materials for donated clothing are nothing more than coarse cloth and coarse twill, so after continuous activity in recent days, there is now a shortage. Prices have also risen one after another. 9-pound cloth is especially popular. Yesterday, Jubao Basin was priced at 4 taels and 9.5 qian, Five Fortune Cats at 5 taels and 0.5 fen, 11-pound Ren Zhong at 5 taels and 5 qian, and Three Rabbits and Three Deer at 5 taels and 6 qian. 11-pound cat-branded coarse twill also reached 5 taels and 8 qian. 12-pound Three Fish was priced at 6 taels, an increase of 0.2-0.3 qian compared to last week. 13-pound coarse cloth also showed slight firmness, with Shuang Ying at 6 taels and 7 qian, and Flying Bear at 6 taels and 5.5 qian. Among the 16-pound cloths, Hongfu from Zhentai Factory was the most stable, selling at 8 taels and 1.5 qian, and Five Cranes at 8 taels and 2 qian. Among the fine twills, Jincheng sold at 7 taels and 5.5 qian, and Balloon fine cloth at 7 taels and 5 qian. Japanese factory goods have plummeted across the board, showing a trend of irreversible decline.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Market is Excellent</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market has made great progress recently, with dealers actively purchasing. The weather is cool, stimulating actual sales, and retail business in stores is also suddenly booming. The silk cocoon industry is also extremely busy. Printed flannels such as Zhigong, Serge, Huashi flannel, Chocolate, and raincoat fabrics are selling extremely well, with both boxed and individual piece sales. Compared to last month's market conditions, there is much better color. The transactions for Melton, thick and thin Sea Tiger velvet, Shaorong, cotton velvet, leopard-skin mink velvet, colorful plaid overcoat fabric, printed flannels, and rotten silk flannels are also active. Most are first ticketed and settled, with staggered deadlines for clearance. A significant number are paid for in cash on the spot. Judging from the recent trend in the woolen fabric market, thick goods are better than thin goods.</p>

<h3>Two Pedestrians Wrongfully Killed by Police Shooting on Bubbling Well Road</h3>
<p>Robbery Unsuccessful, Fled Immediately</p>
<p>Heavy Gunfire on Bubbling Well Road</p>
<p>Two Men Shot and Killed</p>
<p>A Female Servant Hit by Stray Bullet in the Leg</p>
<p>Near the Bubbling Well Road small vegetable market, at approximately 3:15 PM yesterday, police officers chased and apprehended robbers. Both sides opened fire, bullets flying across the road, killing two pedestrians. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Robbers Target Clothing Store: Shao Yun Ji Clothing Store, located at No. 20 Yong An Lane, Avenue Road, is owned by Shao Yunhe from Haimen. At approximately 3:10 PM yesterday, four men suddenly entered the customer area. One stood at the doorway without entering. Of the three, one wearing a raincoat with a white silk shirt underneath, told the shopkeeper they wanted to have clothes made. The shopkeeper, noticing they were not carrying any fabric, was suspicious. As he was about to ask questions, the man pulled out a pistol and ordered them to be silent. At this time, one robber had already gone upstairs, entering the room of a Mr. Li in the pavilion. Two robbers also followed up the stairs, threatening with guns, but finding nothing of value, they went downstairs together and fled out the door.</p>
<p>One Robber Injured and Captured: After the robbers left the store, the clothing store staff chased after them shouting "Catch the robbers!" Police whistles and shouts followed in succession. The robbers fled north on Avenue Road, turning into Honan Road, then into Range Road. At this time, three robbers had disappeared without a trace. Only one robber was chased and captured. This robber ran to the vicinity of Hong An Lane, escaping into the Qian Yuan Rice Shop to hide temporarily. Later, he fled east onto Bubbling Well Road, firing the gun he held at the pursuing officers. The officers returned fire, hitting him in the lower abdomen. He fell to the ground and was captured.</p>
<p>Passersby Hit by Bullets and Killed: The location where the police fired at the robbers was near the small market. A pedestrian wearing a Zhongshan suit, who had just bought something from a pot shop, was passing by when he was hit by a stray bullet. Wounded, he fled into the Rong Xing Guan beef bun shop. Because the bullet hit his head, he died at the scene. Also, a man pushing a wheelbarrow was hit by a bullet near Hong Xing Lane, wounded in a vital area, and died immediately. Furthermore, a woman named Zhu Shen, was hit in the right leg by a stray bullet and sent to the hospital for treatment. The bodies were sent to the coroner's office to await examination today. It is said that the man in the Zhongshan suit was from Guangdong, very young. He was buying a wok lid at the pot shop, bargaining for ten cents, offering six cents, but not completing the deal. After hearing the gunshots, he suddenly crossed the road and was hit by a bullet. He was still holding several iron hooks in his hand. When he fled wounded into the Rong Xing Guan, he did not say a word, leaning against the meat-cutting board. Blood gushed from the wound in his head. In an instant, he fell to the ground and died. Zhu Shen was a nanny for the Lu family, from Ningbo, 25 years old, living in Wenyuan Lane, Xiaobeimen. At that time, she was on her way to Zhabei to take a car on her employer's order, and passed by the area when she was hit by a stray bullet. The Bubbling Well Road police chief, after the incident, immediately dispatched detectives to hunt down the fleeing robbers. It is reported that several accomplices were apprehended by evening.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Cruelly Throw Ransom Victim into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Failed to Extort 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Eight-Year-Old Child Buried in the Belly of a Fish</p>
<p>Clan Leader Masterminded the Heinous Act</p>
<p>Zhu Songlin Provides Detailed Account of the Circumstances</p>
<p>Yao Jiusheng, the eight-year-old son of widow Yao Gu, residing at No. 199 Ma An Lane, Chongqing Road, was suddenly kidnapped by a gang of bandits on July 7th in front of the home of his maternal grandmother, Gu Zhao, at No. 96 Avenue Road. A letter demanding a ransom of 20,000 dollars was sent. The Jing'an Temple police station was notified. Chinese Detective Jin Yangwu and others apprehended the suspects in this case, Zhu Songlin from Pudong, and a woman, Lu Wang, etc. However, the child Yao Jiusheng has not yet been found. The details of their arrest and transfer to the First Special Court were published in this newspaper on the 11th. It is now learned that Yao Gu is only 25 years old,</p>
<p>Already a Widow: She has only one son. His abduction and disappearance was already extremely distressing. Fortunately, the perpetrators were arrested, making it easier to track down and rescue him, allowing them to be reunited. Who knew that terrible news would arrive? The moon would never be full again. Mother and son would never meet again. Since Yao Jiusheng was abducted, the gang of bandits, resentful over their failure to extort a ransom, actually</p>
<p>Threw Jiusheng into the Huangpu River: Buried in the belly of a fish. Yao Gu was overwhelmed with grief upon hearing the news, and rushed to the police station to demand a thorough investigation. Detective Jin, who was handling the case, questioned the suspect Zhu Songlin about the whereabouts of his accomplices. Zhu confessed that the mastermind behind this case was</p>
<p>Yao Gu's Clan Leader: A local man named Yao Zhusheng (also known as Yao Zisheng). So, at 7:45 AM the day before yesterday, Detective Jin went to No. 210 Chongqing Road and arrested Yao Zhusheng, taking him into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where Judge Feng Shide questioned him. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, rose and stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendant Yao Zhusheng was charged with Article 373 of the Criminal Law, the crime of intimidation, Article 284, the crime of premeditated murder, and Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Kidnappers, requesting a postponement because Judge Wu Tingqi was presiding over the Zhu Songlin case, which was scheduled for a special hearing on the afternoon of the 17th, so he asked to</p>
<p>Postpone and Merge the Cases for Interrogation: And so on. According to Zhu Songlin's confession, he met the defendant Yao Zhusheng in Hankou Yichang. This case was also instigated by Yao. In February 29th of this year, I came to Shanghai from Pudong by boat. As soon as I landed on the Bund, I met the defendant Yao Zhusheng. After talking to each other, we agreed to meet again in the afternoon</p>
<p>At Yile Tian Teahouse: When I met Yao, he learned that I had not been doing well recently, so he gave me two dollars, and said he had something to discuss. He then talked about a Yao Gu in his clan, whose husband had died, fearing improper behavior, and that she was using her property to support her mother's family. He wanted me to seduce her or abduct her child, so that she would have no face to return to the Yao family, and told me that Yao Gu</p>
<p>Always Returned to Her Mother's Home on Saturdays: Her mother's house was located at No. 96 Avenue Road, and had extra rooms for rent. You can seize the opportunity to act. Because I was short of money, Yao gave me dozens of dollars, and I rented two rooms in the back of Gu Zhao's house, Yao Gu's mother. Later, because I saw that Yao Gu was dignified, knowledgeable, and</p>
<p>Did Not Behave Frivolously: I could not bear to harm her. And because the money had been spent, I moved away after living there for more than a month. Later, I met Yao Zhusheng and told him what had happened before, but Yao still ordered me to proceed. So, on July 7th, I lured her child Jiusheng out, intending to take him to Pudong temporarily. When we arrived at the Bund, we hired a sampan. Unexpectedly, at the center of the harbor, I accidentally</p>
<p>Lost My Grip on Jiusheng, Who Fell into the River: I was unable to save him. He drifted away without a trace. The next day, I told Yao Zhusheng about this matter. Yao gave me 25 dollars. In a few days, the money was used up again. I wrote a letter, wanting to get money from Yao Gu to make a living. Unfortunately, I was arrested. When questioned, Yao Zhusheng stated that seven years ago, when I opened a shop in Yichang, I met Yang Sen after the battle. I fled to Hankou temporarily. At that time, Zhu Songlin was</p>
<p>A Butcher in Hankou: And we became acquainted. Later, Zhu stole something and fled without a trace. I have never met Zhu since then. I did not instigate Zhu to abduct Yao Jiusheng. Yao Gu and I are from the same clan, and she calls me "Grandpa." Moreover, her family is not rich. How could I do such a heinous thing? I have been falsely accused. He also hired lawyer Yu Hualong to defend him. Judge Feng verified the confessions and ordered Yao to be held pending further questioning on the afternoon of the 17th, to be heard together with the Zhu Songlin case.</p>
<h3>The Bloody Man on the Street</h3>
<p>Seriously Injured, Silent and Uncomplaining</p>
<p>Mistakenly Hit with an Iron Bar</p>
<p>Three Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>On the evening of the 7th of this month, at 9:55 PM, a man from Yangzhou, Li Jinkui, was found lying on the cement sidewalk at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Avenue Doumer, covered in blood, with a bicycle abandoned beside him. Detective No. 135 of the Avenue Doumer police station discovered him and, when questioned, he could not speak. He was taken to the police station along with his vehicle in a rickshaw. The police chief ordered him to be sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. His head and body were seriously injured. The day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Chief Lu Gengsheng of the police station arrested the suspects Gao A'gen from Songjiang, Ren Fanrong from Shaoxing, and Cai A'lin from Tongzhou, all working as servants for Japanese at No. 175 North Sichuan Road and a Japanese-owned room. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, the victim is currently in the hospital, in serious condition. Since being admitted, he was able to say a few words on the third day, but has since been silent. Please postpone the hearing. The reason for the incident, according to the defendants, was that they had a minor dispute with a certain Ronin and were fighting. Before the matter was settled, the victim was loitering in the area on his bicycle. The defendants mistakenly believed he was an accomplice of the Ronin, so they beat him. When questioned, the three defendants Gao A'gen, etc., stated that they were employed as servants by the Japanese. Previously, they were violently beaten by thugs, so they took revenge, mistakenly injuring Li Jinkui, who was hit by an iron bar by a friend who was at large. After realizing their mistake, it was too late. They asked for leniency. Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confessions and ordered all to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Troubles of Taking a Concubine</h3>
<p>Cai Shichu Attempted Suicide in the Huangpu River Because of This</p>
<p>The Wife Set Three Conditions</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM the night before last, a man over forty years old attempted suicide by jumping into the river at the Jiangxi Road Bridge, Suzhou Creek. He was rescued by a Western police officer from the water patrol, who happened to be passing by. He was taken to the police station, where he identified himself as Cai Shichu, 43 years old, from Ningbo, and owned a printing company. He lived at No. 309 and a half, Weihaiwei Road, in the Public Concession. Recently, he had taken a concubine, causing great turmoil in his family. His wife, Yang, made a lot of noise, and there was no peace. His authority as a husband declined. He felt there was no joy in the future, so he tried to kill himself by jumping into the river. The police chief sent Chinese Detective Ge Changsheng to bring his wife, Yang, to the police station. According to Yang, her husband taking a concubine was definitely with her consent beforehand, but at the time, she had set three conditions: (1) When the concubine entered the house, she should immediately give me 1,000 dollars; (2) He should not favor the concubine over his wife; (3) He should not accompany the concubine out for frivolous amusements. Her husband fully agreed to the above conditions. Unexpectedly, after time passed, her husband changed his mind. Not only had the 1,000 dollars not been received, but he accompanied the concubine to the theater and the cinema day and night, enjoying himself at will. Her hopes were completely dashed, so she cried and made a scene, not knowing that he would become so disillusioned and kill himself. The police chief, considering this a domestic dispute, advised both parties not to harm their marital relationship. He sent the original detective to escort them ashore and home.</p>
<h3>Thugs Extorting Money</h3>
<p>Gao Defa's Evil Nature Untamed</p>
<p>Wang Yanling Injured and Sues</p>
<p>Gao Defa (nicknamed "Big Bun"), from Jiangbei, was originally a well-known thug. After being punished by the French Concession court many times, he has now changed his profession to selling socks. However, his evil nature has not changed, and his actions are often irregular. Knowing that Wang Yanling, the owner of Wang Yan Ji Yarn Store, located in Fuxin Lane, Avenue Edward VII, was making a profit from his business, Gao went to Wang's store the day before yesterday and demanded to borrow 1,000 taels of silver. Wang refused, saying that there had never been any dealings between them. Gao left and immediately gathered more than a dozen accomplices, each carrying weapons, and waited in ambush at the entrance of Fuxin Lane. When Wang came out of the store, they dragged him away and beat him, taking Wang to the Jingchunlou Teahouse outside the Old North Gate and forcing him to sign three written agreements: (1) He was forced to sell 100 pieces of velvet yarn, paying a deposit of 350 taels of silver. If he could not sell them, he would have to compensate 50 taels of silver per piece; (2) He was forced to buy 750 pieces of waste wool. If he did not do so, he would have to compensate 3,000 taels of silver; (3) He was forced to guarantee the business of Shi Xiangchu, because Shi was currently working for Gao and had already used 200 yuan. At the time, Wang did not want to sign, but Gao slapped Wang twice. Under this oppressive force, Wang had no power to resist and had to sign. After the matter was over, he was allowed to go free. However, after being beaten by the thugs, Wang was seriously injured and immediately took a car to Dr. Qin Heqi's trauma clinic for treatment. He then hired lawyer Jin Yu and filed a complaint with the Second District Court, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Implements Famine Relief</h3>
<p>Advising Farmers to Plant More Wheat in Winter</p>
<p>Propaganda Conducted by the Agricultural Improvement Station</p>
<p>Using Accumulated Grain Funds to Purchase Wheat Seeds</p>
<p>Baoshan's agricultural products have always been 70% cotton and 30% rice. This year, due to wind and rain disasters, the cotton harvest is hopeless, and the rice harvest is poor. The livelihood of farmers is extremely difficult. It was previously decided by the county government conference to have the Agricultural Improvement Station advise farmers to plant more wheat in winter, and it was approved to allocate a portion of the accumulated grain funds to purchase wheat seeds to meet the needs of farmers. The agricultural station has already started to organize an agricultural station cooperative propaganda team with the cooperative office to go to various districts, townships, and towns to conduct practical propaganda, advise farmers to plant more wheat in winter, post slogans encouraging wheat planting, and distribute leaflets. At the same time, farmers are advised to organize production cooperatives to benefit people's livelihoods. It is reported that the agricultural station's planned propaganda work will take two weeks to complete.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Field Disaster Situation in the Wusong District is Severe</h3>
<p>The Wusong District Municipal Committee Office, previously reported that local wardens and farmers had sent letters reporting water shortages, with cotton fields being flooded and the autumn harvest hopeless, requesting investigation and remediation. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Wusong District Municipal Committee members Liu Yutong and Tang Zuanzhi, after receiving the report, immediately forwarded it to the Social Affairs Bureau, and sent staff to conduct surveys in each ward. It is estimated that in all ten wards, excluding the not yet reported Gang Zi Twenty-Five and Thirty-Two, the disaster situation in the remaining eight wards is as follows: (1) Teng Forty-One Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 12 households, 50% or more - 7 households, less than 50% - 1 household; (2) Teng Forty Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 122 households; (3) Teng Thirty-Nine Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 87 households, 50% or more - 31 households, less than 50% - 1 household; (4) Gang Thirty-Three Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 2 households, 50% or more - 34 households, less than 50% - 2 households; (5) Yi Thirty-Six Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 4 households, 50% or more - 20 households; (6) Tui Thirty-Five Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 86 households, 50% or more - 1 household; (7) Tui Thirty-Four Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 67 households, 50% or more - 2 households; (8) Tui Twenty-Two Ward, 70% or more of the households affected - 55 households. The Wusong Municipal Committee Office prepared a survey register yesterday and submitted it to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that staff be sent to re-survey and find ways to provide relief. However, yesterday, the Wusong area was hit by strong winds and heavy rain, and the tide rose to 39 feet. The fields were flooded, and it is feared that the degree of disaster will be even greater than before. Farmers are complaining incessantly.</p>
<h3>Cargo Transportation to Pukou Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Due to High Water and Strong Winds at the Riverside Station</p>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received a telegram from the Nanjing Riverside Station yesterday stating that due to high water and strong winds on the riverside, all cargo loaded from Shanghai should be temporarily suspended from being transported to Nanjing, and that they would be notified again to resume transportation after the water receded and the wind subsided. It is reported that the Shanghai Transportation Association and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Transportation Association also received telegrams from the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing Transport Association, reporting the above situation. Therefore, starting yesterday, all goods loaded from Shanghai to Nanjing Riverside Station for transfer to Pukou have been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>City Health Bureau Plans Vaccination</h3>

<p>Yang Linxiang, a villager from Jia Yi Bridge, Caoxing District, West Shanghai, was allegedly murdered by his wife, Yang A'nan. After examination by the court, there were still doubts. The deceased's brother, Fu San, requested justice for his brother. The coffin was sealed, and a re-examination was prepared. Police Chief Liu of the Sixth District, Third Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was dispatched to arrest Yang A'nan, and together with the deceased's brother Fu San, they were sent to the court for interrogation. Prosecutor Wu has been repeatedly investigating and interrogating. According to Yang A'nan, she was not at home that day, and he actually died by hanging. She does not admit to murder. The interrogating officer verified the confession. If Yang Linxiang committed suicide by hanging, where is the rope used to cause death? Yang's wife replied that according to neighborhood customs, the rope had been burned to destroy the evidence. Also, when asked, the deceased's brother, Fu San, accused her of murder and requested redress. However, there were many doubts in this case. If Yang's wife did not intend to murder him, why did she evade the truth and flee? Furthermore, the instrument of death has been burned and destroyed, making it impossible to prove. It was heard yesterday that the court will perform a bone steaming examination to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>Xia Zhonglian Asks</h3>
<p>I am a young man of twenty. Since I was fifteen, due to livelihood issues, I left private school and went to work in business. When I was young, I was neither smart nor mischievous, but I especially liked to read novels, such as *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Water Margin*, *Dream of the Red Chamber*, *Yue Fei's Biography*, etc. I have read almost all of the old novels. At the same time, I inevitably neglected my studies. Until I abandoned my studies and went into business, the knowledge I gained was nothing more than recognizing commonly used characters. When I was an apprentice, I didn't feel anything, but now, although my job is bookkeeping, my livelihood can only maintain my current state. My elderly father, weak mother, and young sister have no extra strength to care for them. Although family expenses are temporarily supported by my father's best efforts, how can I feel good about it? Solving this problem requires seeking a higher-paying career, but I am limited by my intelligence and financial resources. If I re-enter school, time and money will be difficult to come by. After much thinking, I feel that it is not too late to work hard and study hard at this time. Therefore, I would like to join a correspondence school so that I can receive appropriate guidance during my spare time (in fact, my spare time is only before 7:00 AM and after 9:00 PM). Now, what I need is knowledge of English, arithmetic, Chinese, and drawing, because I don't know any English. If I know it, I can read Western newspapers and magazines. Drawing can harmonize my temperament and can also be used to help me make a living. Arithmetic seems to be a required item for entering any school. Chinese naturally needs to be studied in depth. Which of these four correspondence schools is the most complete? Are there any books on this subject that are easy to use for self-study? Please advise.</p>
<p>(Reply) It is very good that you are determined to study in your spare time. This is the only way for you. I hope you first make a decision.</p>
<p>English must be at a considerable level before you can do correspondence study. If you don't know anything, it's very difficult. We think it's not the most important thing for your needs. Chinese and arithmetic are very important. You should focus on the applied aspects. The Commercial Press Correspondence School on Baoshan Road, Shanghai has these two subjects. You can request a copy of the regulations. If you are satisfied, you can try it. If you have never studied painting, it may not be easy to do correspondence study either. I just don't know how your talent is for this subject.</p>
<h3>Yu Kongzhang Asks</h3>
<p>I was forced to study business in the grocery industry due to my childhood environment. Now I work in this industry, filling the position of bookkeeping clerk. I feel that I lack both the knowledge and experience of the commercial future. I have repeatedly wanted to study, but I lack a suitable direction and opportunity. Since I have already studied business, I must pursue in-depth study in business. Observing the current era of commercial competition, if businessmen have simple minds, no vision, and no fresh ideas, they will surely fail. Therefore, the knowledge and experience of businessmen are very important, and there is a real need to engage in research. I am now planning to use my spare time to supplement my studies with a kind of practical knowledge related to business and more progressive. However, limited by the economic strength of our shop assistants, it is questionable how to obtain this kind of practical knowledge that is pertinent to business. I sincerely request that you give me appropriate direction, or what subjects to study on my own to make up for my shortcomings, and I hope you will reply in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) According to your current environment, it is best to supplement your studies in your spare time. You can refer to the reply to Xia Jun's question above. The Commercial Press Correspondence School also has a business department, but the lowest business preparatory course requires at least four or five years of English level, which may not be very suitable for you. We think Chinese and arithmetic are still important, but you should focus on application. There is also one more thing, since you are a bookkeeper, bookkeeping correspondence is also suitable. The Lixin Accountant Firm at No. 452 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, was founded by accountant Pan Xulun, and has an affiliated accounting correspondence school. You can request a copy of the regulations. If you are satisfied, you can try it.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Relieves West District Dairy Farms of Cattle Plague</h3>
<p>Some dairy farms in this city suffered from cattle plague last month, especially the cattle at Chen Mujin's Dairy Shed on Route Cardinal Mercier, with the most severe illness. Of the ten dairy cows, all were seriously ill. Before the owner of the dairy shed went to the Commodity Inspection Bureau to request veterinarians to diagnose and treat them, two dairy cows worth 500 yuan died. There were still five cows suffering from diarrhea and loss of appetite, with very high body temperatures, and milk production completely stopped. After injecting serum, the diarrhea stopped in six days, appetite increased, and milk production returned to normal. They have now fully recovered. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau is very willing to provide this kind of service and hopes that all milk companies will contact the bureau at any time to arrange for preventive cattle plague injections to avoid spreading the disease.</p>
<h3>Verdict to be Announced in Case of Police Officer Shooting and Killing Shop Employee</h3>
<p>Le Ke Rang, a patrolman from the Second Precinct of the First District in the city, was playing with Ding Lianchang, an employee of the Old Parade Ground Shoe Store, when a bullet was accidentally fired, killing Ding. The Public Security Bureau sent Le to the local court, where the prosecutor investigated and filed charges. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yongzhou opened the court. According to Le's testimony, at 9:40 PM on August 8th, I saw more than 20 people gathered together in the Old Parade Ground, and suspected they were bandits, so I went with live ammunition to disperse them. Later, when I was removing the bullet, it accidentally fired, mistakenly injuring Ding Lianchang. The judge said that Huang Lianfu, the owner of the shoe store, had long stated in the investigation court that you aimed the gun and played with it, causing it to fire, and you loaded the bullet yourself, so how could you not know about unloading it? He then summoned the deceased's younger brother, Ding Miaosheng, to testify. I did not witness my brother's death. The shop owner Huang Lianfu testified that he was not in the store at the time, and that the police officer did not intend to do it. So-called he was unlucky, and the deceased was also unlucky. The judge asked if he had already received compensation for the private settlement for the previous statement of accidentally shooting and killing? (Answer) Yes. Then, he asked prosecutor Yang Qi for his opinion, who said that the defendant aimed and shot, hence the injury to the head, and his gun was very good, so it would not misfire. Please make a judgment according to the law. The interrogating officer announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced tomorrow. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Owen Dies</h3>
<p>Owen, a mechanical engineer at the Dredging Bureau, was shot several times when he was distributing wages on a dredger. He recovered at a public hospital and returned to his country for recuperation. After half a year, he returned to Shanghai and resumed his work. Recently, his abdomen became enlarged and unsightly. He went to the hospital to request surgery. It turned out that the previous surgery had not yet healed. This time, surgery was necessary, but he could not withstand it and died. A telegram has been sent to England to invite his wife to return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Leaking the Secret Method of Manufacturing Rubber Shoes</h3>
<p>Da Zhonghua Factory Accuses Xue Fuxiang</p>
<p>Jiangnan Factory Suspected of Collusion</p>
<p>Xue Fuxiang, a technician at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, recently secretly informed the Jiangnan Rubber Factory of the factory's secret method for manufacturing galoshes and entered into a contract. This was discovered by Wu Zhesheng, the manager of Da Zhonghua, who retained lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a lawsuit with the French Concession police. After the captain dispatched detectives to arrest Xue, he was escorted to the Second Special District Court yesterday, where Judge Luo Renji of the Criminal Division interrogated him. First, Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, explained the case, stating that the prosecution was based on Articles 335 and 366 of the Criminal Law, "Obstructing Secrets" and "Breach of Trust," requesting an investigation. In addition, the plaintiff Wu Zhesheng's lawyer stated that the defendant was an assistant technician at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory and was instigated by the owner of the Jiangnan Rubber Factory on Wuhua Road to leak the secret manufacturing method of Da Zhonghua's galoshes. A witness, Xu Zengyuan, saw the defendant boiling oil and mixing ingredients at the Jiangnan Factory on the 13th. It was found that the Jiangnan Factory actually colluded with the defendant to enter into a contract. The wording of the first two articles clearly instigates the theft of Da Zhonghua's trade secrets. This manufacturing method is a technology that Da Zhonghua obtained after expending great effort and spending 50,000 yuan of national currency. Once leaked, not only will the factory's capital be shaken, but more than 2,000 workers will also be affected. He requested a strict investigation according to law, etc. After Judge Luo asked the defendant's age and address, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and await a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Weihan's Remarks After Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Did Not Take Up Position as Counselor in the Civil Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Will Move to Suzhou to Study</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Weihan, the commissioner of the Yunnan Province and director of the Department of Civil Affairs, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. A reporter from the New Shanghai News, having read reports that he had experienced a scare in Beijing, went to his residence to interview him. Mr. Zhang received him and was editing his old poetry manuscripts, appearing very leisurely. After exchanging pleasantries, they began to talk. Reporter (Q): The newspaper reported that you had a scare in Beijing. What was the misunderstanding? Zhang (A): This matter was due to the Beijing Garrison Headquarters receiving a telegram from the Hankou Garrison Headquarters stating that a certain Zhang from Hubei Province, who had committed a crime, had fled to Beijing and was staying at Room 33 of the Central Hotel. They requested a swift investigation and arrest. Because my surname was the same, my accent was close to that of Hubei, and I happened to be staying in Room 336, I was mistaken by the intelligence officers of the headquarters. They came to interrogate me without first investigating the details. Their handling of the matter was too careless. Commander Sheng Gu Zheng Lun has already dismissed and punished those involved. I have not taken it to heart. (Q): What was your mission in Beijing this time? Did you meet with Chairman Chiang? (A): I was only there to attend the state funeral of the late President Tan. I had no other mission, so I did not visit the Chairman. I only visited Tan's tomb. (Q): The newspaper reported that the National Government appointed you as a counselor in the Civil Affairs Bureau. Have you taken office? (A): The National Government originally planned to appoint one counselor from each province to the Civil Affairs Bureau to provide advice on local conditions. When I participated in the drafting of the treaty with Vietnam in Beijing the year before last, I had already recommended a suitable person to fill the position. This person is sufficient to provide advice. Zhang also said that he had been in politics for many years and felt quite tired. His current situation is difficult, but his desire to study has not diminished. Yesterday, he passed through Suzhou and a friend helped him rent several rooms in a garden. He considered it very suitable for reading and will move there to study and rest.</p>
<h3>Loan Case of Shenxin Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Clarifies No Involvement</p>
<p>Regarding the loan case of the Shenxin Yarn Factory, there were mentions involving Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. Yesterday, Wu Tianfang, an aide in the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, stating that the newspaper reported that the loan case of the Shenxin Yarn Factory involved Minister Wang. This morning (i.e., the morning before), the Minister returned to Beijing and was immediately asked about this matter. According to him, he has never interacted with Rong Zongjing of the factory, and he knew nothing about the reported incident.</p>
<h3>General Manager Guo of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Responds to Seven Demands of Dockworkers</h3>
<p>Bonuses and Meals Cannot Be Handled at Present</p>
<p>Dismissal and Employment Are Administrative Prerogatives</p>
<p>Since the dockworkers of the five wharves of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company raised seven demands, including giving bonuses, providing meals, reinstating old workers, and dismissing new workers, the Social Bureau has ordered both parties to negotiate on their own. Yesterday, General Manager Guo of the company responded to the seven demands item by item. The following is a special excerpt. We have received your letter and listed seven demands, which have all been read. The replies are as follows: (1) Regarding the request to grant bonuses according to the principle of equality, the case of the bonus dispute issued by former Commissioner Li is still under consideration by this office. We will report it to the National Government in the future, and we should wait patiently for the National Government's instructions. This case has not been resolved at all, and it is impossible to handle it at present. (2) Regarding the issue of providing meals, firstly, there has been no precedent for providing meals for decades. Secondly, there are too many warehouse workers. At a time when the company's finances are stretched, it is really impossible to suddenly increase the huge burden. We can only discuss it at length after future economic conditions improve. (3) The transfer of Wu Bingru and others to other positions is either for promotion or for mutual transfer to warehouses to increase experience, which is absolutely beneficial to the individuals being promoted. Why is it considered inappropriate? According to the positions of the warehouse staff, promotion to the five warehouses has always been the practice, especially the South Warehouse. This is purely an administrative prerogative of the company in employing people. Now, your association is interfering, which is beyond the scope of protecting workers. Even in the previously agreed treatment conditions, there is no provision that promotions cannot be made. This request is unreasonable. (4) The dismissal of Zhou Xinbao and the other four people was confirmed to be due to theft of goods and cannot be compared to unwarranted dismissal. It is a matter of course that warehouse staff should conduct themselves with integrity, cherish their reputation, and jointly promote the business of the warehouse. There is no room for pretense. Now, your association does not punish the warehouse staff who stole the goods, which is already strange. Instead, you are protecting them, which is tantamount to deliberately destroying the reputation of the company's warehouse business. The company really cannot bear the sorrow. (5) If there are shortages of goods in each warehouse, the company should appoint new people to fill the vacancies. This is the company's administrative power to employ people. It is clearly stipulated in Article 1 of the previously agreed regulations. Moreover, the appointed staff are all assistants and have considerable ability. They can be competent under the guidance of the supervisors. The so-called "unfamiliar with the wharf situation" is too empty and cannot be a reason. It is close to intentional exclusion. (6) The company can order the warehouse managers to notify the workers who have not joined the association. However, if they voluntarily do not join the association, it is a matter for the individual to handle. The company cannot force them. If they have not committed any faults, how can they be dismissed because of this? Moreover, if they do not join the association, they will not be able to enjoy the protection of your association in the future. It is their own abandonment of benefits and does not harm your association in any way. (7) This article can instruct the warehouse managers to investigate the residential status of the dependents and order them to move. If they do not comply, consider punishment. Immediate dismissal is too harsh and unfair. In short, the commissioner has always had the intention of protecting the workers. All the bad treatments or reasonable requests will be happily adopted. However, if they exceed the proper limits and are close to threats, it will be difficult to accept. According to the company's environment in recent years, we have been struggling in difficult circumstances every day. At this time, the personnel of the whole company, both inside and outside, should work together to endure and maintain each other, so that we can gradually progress to a bright future and achieve a prosperous period. If we only indulge in emotional impulses and strive for contention, I am afraid that the overall situation is in danger. If the skin does not exist, what will the fur attach to? If that time comes, your association members will be too late to regret it. We all belong to the same family. I sincerely express my heartfelt words. I hope you will consider it together. This is addressed to the Workers' Association of the Five Wharves.</p>
<h3>Old Extortion Case from Last Year</h3>
<p>Ling Hongbin Arrests Ye Xihong, Accusing Him of Extortion</p>
<p>Ling Hongbin, from Taixing, Jiangbei, arrested Ye Xihong, a dockworker, at the Nanmatou in Pudong the day before yesterday and filed a complaint with the Third Sub-district of the Third District, stating that Taixing suffered a bandit rebellion last year, with nine out of ten houses empty and hundreds of people killed. After the army pacified the area, Ye Xihong, as a key member of the bandits, had come to his house and extorted 100 yuan of military pay. The county urgently issued an arrest warrant, but he fled to Shanghai and was seen by me. He requested an investigation. When questioned, Ye Xihong confessed that he had always been a coal porter and was being falsely accused. Due to the seriousness of the case, it was submitted to the Public Security Bureau and was transferred to the District Court for trial yesterday.</p>

Many members have not followed the regulations to correct the change of address of the office, resulting in the inability to deliver various letters from the association.

It is really a disgrace to the officials and is reported in various newspapers in Shanghai and Changshu, and has become a joke to neighboring countries. The director of the bureau not only failed to detect it beforehand, but also showed favoritism afterwards. He only transferred the paying police officer to be detained, and did not suspend the officials who were named and had evidence to investigate and deal with them. It is a sign of negligence of duty, and there is also news of concealment. What kind of political system can be established? The association adheres to the party's two aims of integrity and rejection of drugs, and specially represents the people of the native place. I respectfully request that you investigate and punish them severely according to law in order to maintain official morals and strictly prohibit smoking.

<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Coal Industry: The Shanghai Coal Industry Trade Association telegraphed: To all compatriots of agriculture, industry, commerce, study, and soldiers: Tracing back to the Manchus entering the customs and seizing sovereignty, the hatred of the Ming Dynasty originated from internal strife. The Qing Emperor was licentious and extravagant in governing, dividing the territory, and losing national sovereignty. In the past three hundred years, mud and sand have been exhausted. Our General Sun was deeply afraid of the nation's demise, advocated a national revolution, struggled for more than twenty years, traveled millions of miles, embraced love, and worked hard until the Xinhai Revolution, creating the Republic of China. It went through Yuan's claim to the throne and warlords fighting. It marked the establishment of the system to destroy the rebellion and accommodate the Communist Party to appease the people. The vision is far-reaching and will last forever. Now, the heavens are unkind, and the General has passed away. For six years since then, the smoke of war has not ceased. The scourge of drought has not subsided, and the disaster of floods has spread. The Central Plains has been submerged, and the number of starving people in the disaster area has reached 60 million for two months. Speaking of drought, the afforestation policy is lost. Speaking of flooding, the water control policy is dead. The act of dismantling has not been promoted, and the implementation of the Three People's Principles is pending. Suddenly, there is news of war in Guangdong and Guangxi, and war in Xiang and Gan. The sound is broadcast, and the heartstrings are about to break. Alas, who has no brothers, such as feet and hands, and who has no husband and wife, such as guests and friends. May I ask in the rain of bullets, who is willing to be forgiving? Thinking of boiling beans to burn stalks, I am ridiculed by barbarians. How can I bear to let the people of water and fire be in an eternal abyss? Do not teach the red and white foreign invaders to penetrate into the heart. Shanghai coal merchants, seeing this crisis, cannot help but be horrified. Thinking of turning war into peace, I used telegrams to express my feelings, praying to embrace love, implement the Three People's Principles, work together in harmony, quickly achieve equality and freedom, clumsy writing is difficult to stretch, and the main points are not complicated. I deeply hope that we will all share peace and harmony, and we will get the national welfare. Lin Dian is frightened, and I pray for public consideration.

<p>Tea Industry: The Nanshi Tea Industry Association held its 22nd executive committee meeting yesterday. (1) Because the spring tea production this year was poor and the source price was high, the price was revised. The minimum price of 30 cents per catty was removed, that is, the original price of 35 cents per catty was the minimum. Some colleagues still sell 3 catties for one yuan according to their usual habits. Other colleagues and shops believe that this violates the regulations and disputes arise. Yesterday, the association, in order to be cautious, requested the city chamber of commerce to send personnel to the meeting for guidance in advance. Yesterday, Xue Guangqian, a representative of the city chamber of commerce, attended the meeting and had a long discussion. It was decided that the association would issue a notice, clarifying the facts, and the minimum price is 35 cents per catty, and each yuan still sells 3 catties. If any store objects to 3 catties per yuan, they must send a letter to the meeting with the reasons for the objection. If there is no reply after receiving the notice, it will be deemed as tacit consent. (2) Recently, the flood area in various provinces has been large, and various public offices are conducting fundraising for disaster relief. Colleagues in our industry also have this intention. However, how should the solicitation process be carried out? It was decided to publicly recommend Yang Shangting, Hu Jianchen, and other eight people from the executive committee to solicit donations separately, only soliciting donations from colleagues in the industry. Once the collection is completed, it will be distributed to various disaster relief agencies. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Ice Fresh Fish Industry: The Shanghai Ice Fresh Fish Industry Trade Association, in view of the severe floods in various provinces, in addition to the 1,000 yuan of disaster relief funds that have been collected and sent to the Ningbo Native Place Association to urgently help the victims in Hankou, it is now planned to raise more disaster relief funds for various provinces. A meeting of all colleagues was specially convened on the 13th of this month to raise disaster relief funds. It was decided that the commission earned by each fish shop on each day of business on the 14th and 15th would be used as disaster relief funds for various provinces. All operating expenses for the two days shall be borne by each firm. At the same time, all firms are notified to comply, and the commissions obtained shall be remitted to the Ice Fresh Fish Industry Trade Association on the same day for forwarding to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Flood Relief in Various Provinces.</p>
<p>Duck Slaughtering Operation: The Shanghai Duck Slaughtering Operation Trade Association, because the number of duck feathers produced by colleagues is very large, and they are sold by the duck feather shops at a depreciated price, which is very painful. Therefore, colleagues initiated the organization of a duck feather production cooperative. Currently, 20,000 yuan of shares have been raised, and the machinery has also been transported. The houses are under construction, and it is scheduled to officially start business at the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: Regarding the news published in your newspaper this morning about Pu Wenting being kidnapped, some of the wording is inappropriate. Upon investigation, the location is Pu Wenting's residence in Shanghai. A woman surnamed Wang is Pu's family member, and the landlord, also surnamed Wang, is a relative of Pu. Fearing misinterpretation, this special letter is to clarify the situation, hoping it will be included in your newspaper's "Letter to the Editor" section for correction, to reveal the true facts. With sincere regards, Zhou Yi, September 15th.</p>

<h3>Old Wu's Vernacular Literature</h3>
<p>One day, I encountered Old Wu in an alleyway selling baked sweet potatoes. He had six bamboo skewers representing six prize levels: horse, cow, sheep, chicken, dog, and pig. I saw that the "pig" was the character 字, and I suspected he had been influenced by the New Literature. But then I saw the character "dog" and suspected he still had affection for the Old Literature. Out of curiosity, I asked him why he changed "豕" (shǐ, ancient word for pig) but not "犬" (quǎn, dog). Only then did I realize he was a representative of an incomplete literary reformer. This is a playful poem I sent to Old Wu:</p>
<p>"Old Wu sells sweet potatoes,</p>
<p>Drawing lots determines the winner.</p>
<p>Lots are divided into 'horse', 'cow', 'sheep',</p>
<p>And also 'chicken', 'dog', 'pig'.</p>
<p>I advise changing 'dog' to 'hound',</p>
<p>He says he must follow the book.</p>
<p>I say, the book uses '豕',</p>
<p>Not your 'pig'.</p>
<p>Like a woman with bound feet,</p>
<p>Wanting to become a woman with unbound feet.</p>
<p>Counting the peaches and plums,</p>
<p>Old Wu surpasses Old Hu."</p>
<h3>The "Dwarf" Tomb of Nantong</h3>
<p>— Yin Shouman</p>
<p>During the late Ming Dynasty, the Central Plains were rife with troubles. Japanese pirates seized the opportunity to invade, and the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were repeatedly ravaged. They plundered, raped, and did everything imaginable. The people suffered greatly from their calamities. One day, more than five hundred Japanese pirates invaded the southern suburbs of Nantong. The government troops, fearing their power, dared not resist and simply closed the city to await reinforcements. At that time, there was a flour merchant named Cao Ding, skilled in martial arts and extraordinarily brave. Witnessing this situation, he was greatly angered and exclaimed, "Are we, the subjects of the majestic Ming Dynasty, willing to accept such humiliation? How can we face our ancestors in the afterlife?" He then gathered over a hundred strong men from the village, organized them into a unit, and explained the righteousness of the cause. All were moved and swore to live or die together. Cao then tied flour knives to the ends of sticks to use as weapons and used horses that ground flour as mounts. After the preparations were complete, he mounted a horse, brandished his knife, and led the team straight into the enemy's camp. Caught off guard, the enemy suspected that a flying general had descended from the sky and fell into confusion and disarray. The government troops inside the city responded, and the momentum increased. Most of the enemy was annihilated, and the rest fled in panic. Cao pursued them for thirty li (a unit of distance) (a place name). Suddenly, it rained heavily, and the horse became trapped in a muddy pit and could not get out, and Cao was killed. The villagers were grateful for his righteousness and bravery and built a shrine and erected a statue at the foot of Wolf Mountain to commemorate him. They also buried the Japanese corpses north of the shrine, which is now the "Dwarf" Tomb. It is estimated to be four zhang (a unit of height) high and about four mu (a unit of area) wide. The late sage Zhang Jian specially built a pavilion on top of it as a place for tourists to rest, naming it Jingguan. This was intended to signify the accumulation of corpses and sealed earth to represent the achievements of the battle. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, more than ten Japanese naval officers came to Tong to sightsee. Seeing this historical site, they thought it harmed the national image and wanted to move the remains back to their country. After being politely refused by local people, they left reluctantly.</p>
<h3>Jiang Kanghu Doesn't Forget His Motherland</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month at noon, I accompanied Mr. Huang Jingwan to visit Dr. Jiang Kanghu, who had recently returned from the United States. We talked for quite a while. Mr. Jiang has been away from the country for five years. This time, he will only stay for less than a month before going west again. This trip is purely for sightseeing in his motherland and catching up with friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is a honorary consultant at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., a special lecturer at the University of Oregon, and the director of a professor at McGill University in Canada. He signed a "lifelong" contract. Mr. Jiang is the only Chinese person to serve as the director of a professor at a university in the United States. Mr. Jiang recently wrote "An Outline of Chinese Culture" in English and translated "Three Hundred Tang Poems," which was published in New York in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang said, "I (Jiang refers to himself this way below) live a comfortable life in the United States and am content to stay. However, I hear about the natural disasters and man-made calamities befalling my motherland, and I feel saddened. I am also a member of the Chinese nation. Living a carefree life overseas, I cannot bear to see my compatriots suffering. I plan to return to China in a few years, dedicate myself to academics, live a simple life, and share the hardships with my compatriots." From this, we can see that Mr. Jiang has not forgotten his motherland.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang had previously met with the deposed Emperor Xuantong. This time, upon returning to China, he was also summoned by Chairman Chiang. On the evening of the 13th, he went to Nanjing with Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, and spoke with Chairman Chiang. He said that he has "pure intentions and does not harbor any ulterior motives."</p>
<h3>New Anecdotes of Ronghu</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>The Vicissitudes of the Streets: The terrain of Wuxi city is relatively low. Therefore, when floods come, the streets inside and outside the city along the river are completely submerged in water, forming a vast expanse with no boundaries. There is a sense of vicissitudes in the city. In order to maintain transportation, the citizens set up long wooden planks everywhere, like the double rails of a railway. Peddlers travel back and forth on them, looking like a dragon palace in the sea. Although the water has receded in some areas, it is still difficult to walk because the streets of Wuxi, except for a few roads, are mostly paved with bricks. After being submerged in water for many days, they have undergone changes, either protruding or sinking. The ground level has long been destroyed, like the rugged mountain roads of Sichuan, making people sigh that it is impossible to walk. Some citizens have written to the authorities, requesting that repairs be carried out quickly, as this is an important municipal matter. Otherwise, the transformation of hills and valleys is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The World of Tanchun Opera: Apart from the scenery of the lakes and mountains, Wuxi lacks entertainment venues. Although there have been a few theaters, they have been intermittent and are now extinct. When Beijing opera transformed into movies, the Zhongnan and Wuxi theaters emerged in response, and the people's attention was focused on the silver screen. Recently, there has been another transformation into Tanchun opera. The Zhongdong Theater took the lead, and it was packed every night. Soon, everyone saw it as a speculative business. As a result, the First Theater, the Xinmin Theater, and the Dahua Theater sprang up one after another, all making profits three times over. The plays performed include "The Pearl Pagoda," "Double Pearl Phoenix," "The Jade Dragonfly," "Liang Shanbo," and "Diao Nanlou." Posters are visible everywhere in the streets. The troupe is not called Tanchun opera but Southern Opera. All the gongs, drums, costumes, and scenery are the same as in traditional operas, but the singing and dialogue are still in Tanchun. This is truly a new face for this genre. The lyrics are crude and vulgar, but the emotions are poignant and touching, fully deserving of the words "sad, sentimental, stubborn, and beautiful." It is especially welcomed by women. It is emotionally moving and unforgettable, and even rain cannot stop it. Therefore, there is a woman in the west gate, a young unmarried woman, who, in her beautiful youth, was moved by the enchanting melodies of the Huangpu River and became so infatuated that she went mad. The newspapers reported it, and the neighbors laughed. This shows the magic of Tanchun opera.</p>
<h3>World Small Events Record</h3>
<p>Female Police in London: In several major cities in Europe and America, great importance is attached to police administration, and all facilities are extremely complete. In addition to male police officers, there are also female police officers, but the number is still not large. Taking London, the capital of England, as an example, female police officers began to be hired before 1925, totaling 24. They were assigned to various services and achieved good results. Soon, the number was increased to 50, and now there are 100.</p>
<p>Private Animal Garden: In a dairy farm in London, there is a horse breeder who is gentle and likes to be with birds and animals. In addition to 100 horses that he raises and watches over, there are two Indian monkeys and a tamed wild rabbit. He often takes a female fox with him to stroll around London, just like people take their pet dogs for a walk. In addition, there are many rabbits, pigeons, canaries, and exotic birds from foreign countries. The sound of birds singing and animals calling all day long is very lively. This place is like a private animal garden. (Haiker)</p>
<h3>A Record of Diving Skills</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>The world champion diver, the Frenchman Maitrejean, has arrived in Shanghai and will perform his amazing skills at the Carnival. At that time, the people of Shanghai will have another feast for the eyes. The Continental Daily has published a brief history of Maitrejean and his skills. The following is a translated excerpt:</p>
<p>Maitrejean's father was originally an athlete, especially skilled in swimming. Therefore, Maitrejean was often taken to the swimming pool by his father when he was two years old. He became interested in swimming through constant exposure and has achieved today's honor. His first diving test was from a height of about seven to nine feet. Although the height increased day by day, there were many times when it was doubled. His heart was always excited by this, so he worked harder. Today, he can dive from a height of 105 feet into water that is only five feet deep and hold the world championship. His fame began when he defeated a famous diver in a public performance in Mexico. Afterwards, he defeated several divers, and his reputation grew. At the same time, due to difficult living conditions, he became a professional diver. According to him, "I have been a professional diver for thirty-four years. In the past ten years, I have often thought about stopping this profession, but my wife does not think so. She says that my energy has not declined and that there is still the possibility of continuing for another ten years. If that is the case, then I will be sixty-seven years old. I cannot help but laugh when I think of an old man with white hair competing with young children." Diving can sometimes be very dangerous. Therefore, when Maitrejean dived into the water from a bridge 136 feet high, he injured his left arm. At that time, he was young and did not care. He continued to do it the next day. As a result, the arm injury became more serious, and he also injured his forehead. He was hospitalized for more than a month before he recovered. Other accidents are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Maitrejean has an amazing skill: diving from the end of a 105-foot ladder in the style of a seabird. As soon as his feet leave the ladder, he is as fast as a falcon. When he reaches the middle, he does a somersault and then dives into the water in a dangerous manner. This skill has been performed many times in Spain, England, the United States, and France and has won much praise. The martial arts movie star Douglas Fairbanks especially praised it. Another of Maitrejean's skills is slow-motion diving. He is as light as a leaf, drifting down, looking like a kite. The posture is extremely beautiful, but it is more difficult than fast-motion diving because it is difficult to maintain the balance and center of gravity of the body while drifting down slowly, and there is a risk of colliding with the edge of the pool or the bottom. Maitrejean said, "When diving into the water from a very high altitude, the eardrums are often struck by the air during the descent, so I have severe hearing loss and there is no way to treat it."</p>
<h3>Records of Sights and Sounds in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Sandflies</p>
<p>The south is full of poisonous insects, plants, and trees. Therefore, Changli (Han Yu) has the line "fearing medicine when getting out of bed." The northern capital has a cold climate, so there should be no such problem. However, in the middle of summer, there are also one or two things to worry about, namely geckos and scorpions, which are especially poisonous. Their shape is like pincers with hooked tails, and the tails contain poisonous juice. They sting people with their tails, causing unbearable pain. The ancient character 萬 (wàn, ten thousand) is a representation of their shape. Later, the radical 虫 (chóng, insect) was added to create the character 蠆 (chài, scorpion). It is actually the same thing. One summer, I was temporarily living in Professor Wang's residence at Yenching University. During a daytime nap, I heard rustling sounds by my pillow, but I didn't think much of it. At night, when I unfolded my quilt, there was a scorpion there! I was so terrified that I could hardly sleep. This room had screens and was cleaned thoroughly, but it was still unavoidable. The situation in other places can be imagined. Therefore, those who live in the north should either use a mosquito net or move their beds to the center of the room, away from the walls. However, these creatures cannot kill people with their sting. Modern biologists have long determined this, so there is nothing to worry about. The only thing that humans cannot control is the sandfly. Sandflies are slender and white. They fly and gather on people's skin, almost invisible to the eye. Newcomers are bitten the most severely. In the second year, resistance gradually increases, and those who have lived there for a long time gradually become unafraid. However, those whose blood is easily reactive may never be spared. Xiehe Hospital (Peking Union Medical College Hospital) has studied this phenomenon extensively but has not found a cure. Recently, it has been discovered that the source of sandflies is the Reclining Buddha Temple in the Western Hills. It is said that covering the streams with lime during the spring season may eradicate their roots. In the future, with municipal improvements and the elimination of filth, human effort may not be able to overcome nature.</p>
<p>Daifu (Doctor)</p>
<p>In the northern dialect, doctors are called Daifu (大夫). However, the 大 (dà, big) is pronounced as dài. Southerners often find this strange. However, this pronunciation is very accurate. Da is in the Tai rhyme (泰韻), and the ancient pronunciation should be dài. The current common pronunciation of dà, with a departing tone like the character 達 (dá), is influenced by the Wu dialect. In the Wu dialect, all characters in the Tai rhyme are pronounced in the Ma rhyme (禡韻). It is unknown why, but northerners specifically adopted this Wu dialect pronunciation, while still pronouncing the proper noun Daifu as the correct pronunciation. The same is true for place names. Datong (大同) and Daming (大名) are both pronounced Dàitong (代同) and Dàiming (代名). Ignorant people do not know this and consider the Ma rhyme to be correct and the Tai rhyme to be erroneous, so they shake their heads in confusion. Calling doctors Daifu may also be considered strange. However, it is not known that ancient official titles, used respectfully for a long time, have become customary forms of respect. The title for barbers is Daizhao (待詔), the title for tea servers is Boshi (博士), and the title for pawnbrokers is Chaofeng (朝奉). To extend this, Xianggong (相公) was a title used by the Tang people to respect the prime minister, but after the Ming Dynasty, it was used to call scholars. This is a pre-blessing. Yuanyuan (員外) was a scattered official title in the Tang and Song dynasties, almost available to everyone. Wealthy people in the countryside then usurped this honorific title. Therefore, in novels, local tyrants are always called Yuanyuan. This is an abuse. As for calling doctors Daifu, there is also an explanation. In ancient times, those who practiced medicine had to be connected to the government. The Golden Lotus and Dream of the Red Chamber mention seeking medical treatment and always say to invite a certain Taiyi (太醫, imperial physician). In the beginning, all doctors were Daifu. Subsequently, everyone called doctors Daifu, just like southerners call doctors Langzhong (郎中).</p>

<h3>A Husband's Wife (14)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>His goals and hopes increased and progressed step by step. Initially, he was naturally limited to spiritual comfort, which was already very satisfying. Because the other party's defenses were lax, his imagination gradually turned to physical desires. Mrs. Chen originally did not have a firm will. When she was in love with Mr. Li, she only pursued the individual pleasures of a boastful and seemingly comfortable life. She only felt that Mr. Chen was a restrained moralist who did not know how to enjoy life or make money, especially not enough money to provide for her use. Therefore, she was not satisfied with such a young husband. Her association with Mr. Li was just a kind of social interaction, and she thought it was ordinary social interaction. Because she did not have many friends, she wanted to use Mr. Li to get to know more friends. She herself was not prepared to fall in love with Mr. Li and did not expect to be conquered by Mr. Li's inch-by-inch strategy.</p>
<p>One day, it was Sunday, and Mr. Chen, as usual, did not leave the house. He thought that his wife must be very busy and going out to play with her friends. The night before, he had asked Mrs. Li to buy a lot of food, so he could comfortably eat a meal at home. Who knew that his wife would not go out and would sleep until noon without getting up. Usually, Mrs. Li would clean the house after Mrs. Chen went out, but today, Mrs. Li did not come in to avoid suspicion. The floor was covered with melon seed shells and candy wrappers. Mrs. Chen reached out from the quilt and grabbed a cigarette from the cigarette jar, lit it, and smoked it to her heart's content. Mr. Chen was really restless. He did not dare to urge his wife to get up, but just paced around the room. Who knew that his foot would step on the residue of bubble gum and stick to it.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" he muttered angrily.</p>
<p>"Who brought you bad luck?" Mrs. Chen said from the bed with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>"You can get up now. The Li family has already had lunch. After you get up, you can clean the house. There's bubble gum all over my feet."</p>
<p>"Do you know what time I came back and what time I fell asleep?"</p>
<p>"Then you're awake now."</p>
<p>"Can't I rest for a while?" She threw the cigarette butt on the ground and went back to sleep under the covers. Mr. Chen sighed and saw that there was still more than half of the cigarette left on the ground, so he picked it up, put it out, and placed it on the ashtray.</p>

<p>Relief: Starting yesterday, we have begun collecting items. All sectors and members who wish to donate, regardless of gender, age, or size, old clothes, shoes, hats, etc., can be sent directly to the association.</p>
<p>Joint Fundraising Meeting of Shanghai Guilds and Public Associations: The Shanghai Guilds and Public Associations held a temporary member meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the donation methods of various organizations. Attendees included Wang Xiaoyu, Chen Liangyu, Guo Zhongliang, Wu Shutian, and dozens of others. Chen Liangyu chaired the meeting. After the formal opening ceremony, the discussion was immediately launched. Wang Xiaoyu proposed that guilds and public associations with rental income should allocate one or two months' rent to the relief efforts. Those with no rental income or very little should donate appropriately. Chen Liangyu proposed that organizations that have already voluntarily donated funds to relief agencies should consider making additional donations under the name of the joint association and report the amount of previous voluntary donations to the association for verification. Wu Shutian proposed that representatives of various organizations should go back to hold meetings and submit their decisions, the amount they have committed to donate, and the funds to the joint association within a week, so that the total amount can be compiled and forwarded to the various provincial flood relief committees. The chairman summarized the proposals and put them to a vote, which was unanimously passed. The joint association will notify all affiliated organizations to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts Collect Clothing and Bedding: The Boy Scouts of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have been distributing leaflets since the night before last, on various roads, playgrounds, and movie theaters, on behalf of the Clothing and Bedding Disaster Relief Association at 2007 Route des Soeurs, soliciting donations of clothing and bedding. Therefore, yesterday, the number of clothing and bedding received was even more enthusiastic, reaching more than 1,800 pieces.</p>
<h3>Siam Restricts Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Amended Immigration Regulations Increase Entry Fees</p>
<p>Chinese Chamber of Commerce's Efforts to Argue Against Were Ineffective, Now Implemented</p>
<p>National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Cables Requesting Negotiations</p>
<p>The Siamese General Chamber of Commerce of China sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, The Siamese government's Ministry of Interior promulgated the Amended Immigration Regulations of Buddhist Era 2474 and the Enforcement Law of the Immigration Regulations on August 15th, stipulating an increase in the entry fees for foreigners, to be implemented three months after the date of promulgation. Foreigners returning to their home countries must obtain a return-to-Siam passport from the Siamese government upon leaving Siam and pay a handling fee. This took effect on August 17th, etc. The association found that these newly promulgated regulations are related to our overseas Chinese. We tried in various ways beforehand to cancel the regulations or reduce the fees, but our power was limited and we were ultimately unsuccessful. Now that the regulations and enforcement law have been formally promulgated, in addition to translating them and sending them to the municipal chambers of commerce in coastal cities for the information of overseas Chinese merchants, we enclose the translated texts of the immigration regulations and enforcement law for your perusal and dissemination to all overseas Chinese merchants. Yours, etc." The regulations are appended below:</p>
<p>Immigration Regulations (1) These regulations are named the Amended Immigration Regulations of 2474. (2) These regulations will take effect three months after the date of promulgation in the Official Gazette.

(B) Those temporarily traveling back and forth across the Siamese border. (4) After entering Siam, the place of residence must be reported to the government, which will issue a license. Men and women under the age of twelve are not subject to this rule. From the date of the announcement of these regulations, foreigners who wish to return to their home countries must report to the government and obtain a license in Siam. In the future, after returning to Siam, they must submit the return-to-Siam license to the county government for review and approval. Even if they have a return-to-Siam license, if the government deems them to be undesirable elements, the Siamese government may cancel their license and not allow them to come to Siam. (5) The following people coming to Siam are not subject to these regulations: (A) Ambassadors or representatives of various countries coming to Siam.

(8) If the police suspect that a person has no passport, they should notify the county government to summon that person for questioning. (9) This Ministry order will take effect on August 17th.</p>
<p>Cable Requesting Negotiations: The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Industry, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, saying, "We have just received a letter from the Siamese General Chamber of Commerce of China (see previous excerpts) regarding mutual respect, etc., and have attached a translation. We have learned that no fewer than 100,000 of our countrymen travel to and from Siam every year. If the regulations are implemented, it will cost each overseas Chinese at least 250 yuan in national currency to go to Siam each year. Other harsh regulations are not even being discussed. This expense alone is not something our overseas Chinese can afford. We hereby request that your esteemed departments and commissions investigate and approve our request to quickly find a way to negotiate the revocation or amendment of these regulations to protect overseas Chinese affairs. We are deeply praying and imploring. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, et al., respectfully."

<h3>Establishment of the Chinese Pilots Association</h3>
<p>Breaking a Decades-Long Monopoly by Foreigners</p>
<p>The First Sound of Reclaiming Pilotage Rights</p>
<p>For decades, the pilotage rights in various ports of our country have been occupied by foreigners. Previously, the Ministry of Finance, Navy, and Communications jointly proposed reclaiming these rights and having Chinese nationals take on these roles. Consequently, the Navy established a pilot training school in Shanghai to cultivate talent for succession. Following the labor strike by the foreign pilots association last month due to demands for increased fees, the Ministry of Finance, Navy, and Communications deemed it even more crucial to abolish foreign pilots. It has now been decided that an examination for pilot personnel will be held in Shanghai on October 1st to lay the groundwork for their employment. Chinese professionals in the maritime field have also quickly begun to establish the Chinese Pilots Association, setting up an office at 2 Ocean Creek Bridge on Avenue Edward VII. Preparations have been underway for several months, and now, with the examination date approaching, the association has officially announced its establishment. This is indeed the first sound of our country reclaiming its pilotage rights. Recognizing the significant impact of this matter on our national sovereignty, our reporter has diligently investigated and recorded the following information from various sources:</p>
<p>Election of Members　The Chinese Pilots Association is established by maritime professionals in Shanghai. The members include naval veterans and current shipowners, many of whom are highly experienced and knowledgeable maritime experts. Currently, the association members have elected Chen Ganqing as Chairman and He Hailan as Vice Chairman. Hao Dingxi, Liu Xun Da, Chen Jin Yu, and Huang Xiao Han have been selected as council members. The association will submit their resumes and constitution to the Navy for record.</p>
<p>Approval from the Navy　The association received a reply from the Navy yesterday, stating: "Your submission has been noted. Pilotage is related to national defense and is also subject to international law. This type of public-service nature should follow the established precedent of establishing associations for lawyers and accountants to ensure prudence. According to the report, the elected Chairman, Vice Chairman, and council members are either from maritime backgrounds or have long served on ships. Entrusting them with the affairs of the association should ensure a deep understanding of sovereignty. Approval is hereby granted. The submitted constitution has been slightly revised and is enclosed. Permission is granted for provisional implementation. Once the Examination Yuan issues pilot licenses and the administrative authority is determined, revisions and promulgation can be made if necessary. No other pilot associations have been established elsewhere, and your submission does not mention communication with any other association. The seal to be used should temporarily follow the style of the first type of seal stipulated in the regulations for professional groups. You may create and use the seal on your own." This is the reply.</p>
<p>Contents of the Constitution　The association's constitution consists of four chapters and twenty-one articles. Chapter One concerns the association, with Article One stating that individuals who have not obtained a license through examination by the Examination Yuan are not permitted to serve as pilots, nor are those who hold licenses but have not joined the Pilots Association. Article Two concerns the pilotage area. Articles Four through Nine concern the organization of the association, including the holding of meetings and the election of the chairman. Chapter Two, on responsibilities, Articles Ten through Fifteen, specifies that pilots who neglect their duties and cause damage to ships shall be held responsible. All military secrets regarding military ports, fortresses, and military affairs must not be divulged. Pilot licenses must not be used fraudulently, and official commissions from government agencies must not be declined. Articles Sixteen through Eighteen comprise Chapter Three on disciplinary measures. Violations of this chapter and the association's rules will result in penalties ranging from admonishment, suspension from duty for two months to one year, or revocation of the license. Those whose licenses are revoked cannot reapply to be a pilot for two years. Individuals subjected to disciplinary action may request a review from the competent authority through the Pilots Association, but only once. Articles Nineteen to Twenty-one comprise Chapter Four on obligations. Pilots must report any illegal activities discovered on ships to the competent authority and convene a meeting to review and present the facts and reasons. Pilots, commissioned by judicial authorities, will review the causes of shipwrecks within their pilotage area and serve as appraisers. (Due to the length of the original text, the above is a summarized account.)</p>
<p>Seeking a Way Forward　Following the establishment of the association, it should actively promote pilotage services, aiming to gradually have the association's personnel guide all Chinese and foreign merchant ships in and out of ports, so that foreign pilots will withdraw completely. The Navy has agreed to lend the association a pilot boat to assist in its operations. However, given the deeply entrenched foreign influence in Shanghai and the special relationship between foreign merchant ships and foreign pilots, it will not be easy for the Chinese Pilots Association to secure the pilotage of foreign merchant ships. All of this requires the assistance of the central government with political power so that Chinese pilotage can rise in time and replace foreign pilots. The association is preparing to submit a request to various ministries for concrete assistance in the association's future endeavors.</p>
<h3>Suspect Arrested for Falsely Requesting Expansion of the Concession</h3>
<p>Wang Axing of West Shanghai</p>
<p>Under Detention by the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, after the "Ta Mei Wan Bao" (Shanghai Evening Post) published a report that 200,000 merchants and residents of West Shanghai had requested the expansion of the concession by the Public Works Department (PWD), the Municipal Public Security Bureau (MPSB) launched a rigorous investigation to determine the truth. It has now been learned that Wang Axing, a known hooligan from Zhoujiaqiao, is the prime suspect, and he was arrested yesterday on a warrant. Wang Axing has long been a notorious pest in West Shanghai, also known as Xingshan, nicknamed Xinxin, and nicknamed Rotten-Head Ali. Originally from a poor family in Gaojiagang, Zhoujiaqiao township, he lost his parents at a young age and associated with local thugs from childhood. In the Zhoujiaqiao and Caojiadu areas, he engaged in extortion and blackmail, acting in a brutal and overbearing manner, feared by residents like a tiger. Later, he maneuvered to obtain the position of local security officer, becoming even more unscrupulous. He often colluded with foreign merchants and engaged in acts of currying favor with foreigners. He opened a teahouse to gather gamblers and recruit thugs, thus expanding his influence, much to the suffering of the residents. After receiving a report that Wang Axing was suspected of falsely representing West Shanghai merchants and requesting the PWD to expand the concession, the Municipal Public Security Bureau secretly dispatched Inspector Cao from the Inspection Department, along with the chief of the Zhoujiaqiao police station in the 6th District, to arrest him at the Hongjinyuan teahouse and Yuanxiang general store that Wang Axing ran, at one o'clock in the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Upon arrival, Wang Axing was out, so they told the store staff, "The police chief wants to talk to him. Please ask him to come to the police station as soon as possible." Meanwhile, several plainclothes policemen were dispatched to guard the vicinity. At around 6 o'clock, Wang Axing returned to the store. Upon hearing the report from the store staff, he thought the police chief had something else to discuss, so he went to the Zhoujiaqiao police station with his head held high. Unexpectedly, the arresting officers were waiting. As soon as he was seen, he was handcuffed and taken away. Wang Axing vehemently protested his innocence and requested Inspector Cao not to arrest him today, but to wait until tomorrow for him to turn himself in for questioning. Inspector Cao refused. Seeing this situation, Wang Axing could not escape, so he requested to go to the store to change clothes so he could accompany them. The Inspector agreed. Wang Axing entered the store and went upstairs to change, finally coming down after a long time. He was then escorted into the waiting car. After getting in, Wang Axing took out a hundred-dollar bill and secretly handed it to Inspector Cao, asking for help. Inspector Cao pretended to agree and put it in his pocket. Upon reaching the Public Security Bureau, he presented Wang Axing and the bribe of one hundred dollars to the authorities for prosecution. It is reported that the authorities consider the case to be of great importance and have decided to conduct a rigorous interrogation.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Surety Deposits for Taxes</h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Requests the Public Works Department to Abolish the Practice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, according to a letter from Zhang Zhenxin Sauce Garden, regarding their Yuhe Zhenji Sauce Shop, located at No. 111 Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road, Shanghai International Settlement, which opened on August 25th. As per usual, they applied to the Revenue Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council for a liquor license in advance. After an investigation and estimation by the office, the quarterly tax was assessed at twelve taels of silver. Now, according to the new regulations, a surety deposit of thirty taels of silver is also required. The shop's staff argued that there was no such precedent and refused to pay. However, the office insisted on the payment. After several disputes, they were unsuccessful. At that time, due to the urgency of the opening and the many tasks involved, they had no choice but to pay the surety deposit of thirty taels of silver and the half-season autumn liquor tax of six taels to obtain the license. Taxes are different from electricity and telephone services and should not require surety deposits. Therefore, we respectfully submit this letter to your council to protest to the Public Works Department, requesting that the surety deposit requirement be abolished to ease the burden and comply with legal principles. We eagerly await your response." Upon investigation, the requirement of surety deposits for taxes is unprecedented in the world. Therefore, we respectfully request that you investigate the matter and promptly abolish the surety deposit requirement and return the deposits already collected to their original owners.</p>

<h3>China's First Self-Made Car</h3>
<p>Now on Display at the Road and City Exhibition</p>
<p>China's first automobile is the Minsheng heavy-duty truck manufactured by Li Yichun, the director of the Liaoning Mortar Factory. The Minsheng Factory is attached to the Mortar Factory. It has been specially praised by Vice Commander Zhang and a huge amount of funds have been allocated. The heavy-duty truck has a load capacity of two tons and is best suited for modern Chinese roads. The size is similar to that of a general imported two-ton truck. Regarding the manufacturing method, except for the engine, electrical instruments, meters, and tires, which are temporarily specialized products, all other parts are designed and manufactured in-house. The durability and strength are particularly superior to those of ordinary heavy-duty trucks, while the price is lower. The characteristics are extracted as left.</p>
<p>The water tank is divided into four parts. Ordinary ruts. Water tanks are generally only one. If damaged, they cannot move. The Minsheng heavy-duty truck is divided into four parts. If one part is damaged, it can still operate as usual. Even if it needs to be repaired, the cost is relatively low.</p>
<p>The leaf spring is strong. The front and rear leaf springs are semi-elliptical. Manufactured from chrome vanadium steel. Both ends of the axle holes have special bronze bushings. The thickness is one-quarter thicker than other vehicles. It is naturally superior.</p>
<p>Can swing. If the tire is tilted into the mud in low-lying areas, the car body can swing. The car body can immediately drive out of the mud.</p>
<p>Climbing is unique. If you encounter a slope or a high place, the car will not be affected when driving at 25 or 35 degrees. It's like walking on flat ground. It can be stopped momentarily in the middle of the hillside. You can still muster strength to move forward. There is no risk of pouring backwards.</p>
<p>As described above. We are very fortunate that China has an amazing industrial product. In the future, the factory's efforts and progress will benefit the national industry and commerce and recover countless outflows of profits. Recently, the Road and City Exhibition has opened in Shanghai. The factory has specially leased booth No. 71 to display the Minsheng heavy-duty truck for introduction and allow Chinese people to have a good understanding. The following picture is the style of the car.</p>
<h3>The Six Major Features of the Shunfeng Brand New Car</h3>
<p>—Fu</p>
<p>Has Natural Buoyancy and Free Eat-Row - sensationalized the entire lowest-priced car industry</p>
<p>The Shunfeng brand new car with natural buoyancy and free-row. Since it was announced to the world by Mr. Chrysler, it has been rumored everywhere. The reputation has risen. The Maddie Automobile Company in this city has now arrived in large quantities. The various styles will be on public display starting Saturday the 12th of this month. It is for the appreciation of people in the maritime automobile industry.</p>
<p>The price of the new car is the lowest. There are eight styles of car body. All use steel wire wheels as standard equipment. What are the eight styles? It is a sports car. Sedan sports car. Sports car. Sports sedan. Sedan sports car with rear seats. Dual-use sedan sports car. And two-door. And four-door sedan. The various characteristics of the four-cylinder Shunfeng brand new car are too numerous to mention. The most famous is the specially innovative prime mover machine frame. It is what the Shunfeng brand engineer calls natural buoyancy. Because of this feature, the entire prime mover machine can float naturally on its natural axis.</p>
<p>Chrysler and Shunfeng brand automobile company engineers all believe that the contribution of natural buoyancy to automobile construction is very significant and most valuable. In addition to automatic starting machines, four-wheel racing cars, and steel cars. This should be the fourth major success in automotive engineering. After a long period of measurement and test ride, it has been definitively proven that the function of natural buoyancy can definitely open a new era for four-cylinder cars. The vibration of the four-cylinder engine has been completely eliminated. The economy of a four-cylinder car and the stability of an eight-cylinder car are combined into one. This is something that has never happened before. It is really rare and valuable.</p>
<p>In the past, automobile engineering experts have exhausted all efforts to avoid the vibration and simplicity of four-cylinder engines. By the time the number of cylinders increased, the automobile industry was dedicated to the research and improvement of six-cylinder and eight-cylinder models. They no longer paid attention to four-cylinder engines. However, the engineers of Shunfeng brand continue to work hard and never slacken. It is hoped to create a perfect and perfect four-cylinder car to meet the world. Because they have determined in their minds that the four-cylinder type is the most economical, simplest, and most practical of all gas engines. It is also deeply known for its strong and refined, durable, easy to manage, low operating costs, high speed, easy to operate, and the advantages of being suitable for mountains and deserts. Compared with any vehicle with the same machine power performance, it is equal. There is no difference. Therefore, except for the only drawback of vibration, the four-cylinder car is worthy of being the most complete of the lowest-priced vehicles.</p>
<p>However, the vibration of the four-cylinder car is no longer a worry now. Since Mr. Sanders, deputy director of the engineering department of Chrysler Corporation, first created and successfully announced natural buoyancy, the only shortcoming of engine vibration is that the entire prime mover is floating inside the chassis. It is possible to dissipate the car body frame without leaving any residue. The avoidance of engine vibration has a great relationship with the rubber absorption. The floating power invented and successfully developed by Shunfeng brand engineers is the use of new rubber devices. For example, two engine rubber frames are used instead of the usual three or four. However, the position of these two frames is just right. Fit the scientific principle. Therefore, floating power can achieve this unprecedented great effect. The rear rubber frame is installed in the transverse gear after the power transmission machine. The front frame is just installed under the water pump and supported by a special triangular arc attached to the front transverse gear. The line connecting the front and rear frames must pass through the center of gravity of the prime mover machine. Therefore, the entire prime mover machine is supported by absolute average. In order to maintain the engine's proper straight line and make its action fit within the range allowed by the rubber frame,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Transferred to the manufactured forearm spring. Place in the rear part of the introduction and between the car frame side rails. One end of the spring. Tightened to the engine. The other end is embedded in the rubber in the car frame side rail. Shunfeng brand new car engine frame. With such a special device, it should be stable and quiet to ride. It is completely different from ordinary four-cylinder cars. It is an even more remarkable fact that all vibrations caused by sudden increases and decreases in fast and slow rates are completely absorbed and no longer exist. The Shunfeng brand new car has undergone various tests. For example, it can accelerate from the start to a speed of 40 miles per hour in 9.7 seconds. It can also travel at 65 to 70 miles per hour. This is sufficient to prove that there is no vibration. It is also worth mentioning. When multiple blind tests were conducted. That is, the Shunfeng brand new car is mixed in various vehicles. Ask several automotive experts about the number of cylinders. However, most experts cannot tell whether it is a four-cylinder, six-cylinder or eight-cylinder.</p>
<p>In addition to the free-rowing floating power. Another feature of the Shunfeng brand is free-rowing. This is a unique masterpiece of Shunfeng brand engineers. Its construction is very different from other general free-rowing. Its use. It is managed by the button installed on the dashboard. Just push or pull this management button. The free-rowing of the car can be achieved as desired. Shunfeng brand new car is tied to easy driving. It is also very economical and cost-effective. It is because of this.</p>
<p>Easy power transmission. It is another feature of the Shunfeng brand new car. It is only because it has this feature. Therefore, no matter what the speed of the car is. The transmission of the selected wheel. All are extremely smooth and quiet. When the hourly rate reaches 50 miles. You can transfer from high gear to second gear without free-rowing. Or do the reverse. All are extremely easy and quiet.</p>
<p>Safe steel body. An absolutely safe steel car body. It is the standard equipment of the Shunfeng brand new car. The first innovator by Shunfeng brand engineers. Made of super steel material. Completely electrical splicing. Seamless. Unmatched strength. Since there are no wooden tenons. Naturally, there will be no disadvantages such as looseness, corrosion, and combustion. It can also handle heavy loads. Separate the car body and the chassis frame with insulation. Therefore, there is absolutely no unpleasant friction sound.</p>
<p>Double falling car frame. The double-drop car frame is another safe feature of the Shunfeng brand new car. Especially low. Extraordinarily stable. Extremely easy to manage. The center of gravity of the whole car. It has been specially lowered. The total height of sedan vehicles. And thus reduced to 67 inches. However, its internal spaciousness. There is absolutely no influence. It's more than safe. The style of the new car. And therefore extremely beautiful. Extraordinarily beautiful.</p>
<p>Inward hydraulic brakes. The Shunfeng brand new car. It is the only lowest-priced vehicle with automatic balanced inward hydraulic brakes. Extremely simple. Extraordinarily cost-effective. There is no need for lubrication. There is no risk of joint loosening. Lever fragmentation. And cable expansion. Strict protection. Rain and snow do not invade. Its sensitive and accurate actions are even more outstanding. Unreachable.</p>
<p>The above six major features. What other vehicles are there? There is no one who can combine them. However, the Shunfeng brand new car. In addition to having both. There are also many other advantages. Such as the beauty of the lines. Harmony of colors. Exquisite equipment and decoration. The spectacular new-style water tank and water tank cap. In order to ensure that all major and minor parts of mechanical engineering are excellent and outstanding. Numerous. It is hard to count. The reason why Shunfeng brand new cars are perfect and sensationalize the entire lowest-priced car industry. It is because of this.</p>
<h3>After Visiting the Road and City Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>Inspiring the Nation's Interest in Road Building, Reducing Various Obstacles to Road Building, and Pioneering the Production of Homemade Automobiles</p>
<p>The grand and vibrant National Road and City Exhibition has opened amidst cheers from the masses. Although the scale of this exhibition is not particularly large, generally speaking, the achievement of collecting and exhibiting the road conditions of the entire country within a short period of preparation is already commendable. I believe that although the duration of this exhibition is not long, it has left a particularly deep impression on the people of the country. Road-building movements have long been in full swing in the United States, while in our country, this is only the first time that this topic has been raised. Naturally, it is a matter worthy of celebration.</p>
<p>In the past decade, natural and man-made disasters have followed one after another. Recently, floods have spread across more than ten provinces, with cries of grief heard everywhere and a scene too tragic to bear. Of course, natural disasters cannot be prevented by human power. However, if the country had excellent roads, then when one area suffers from floods, another area could immediately use automobiles to provide relief, transporting food from morning till night. At the same time, the disaster-stricken people could also be immediately transported to a safe area. Whenever China encounters famine, it is at a loss for what to do, and watches the people die without being able to provide relief, simply because of the lack of roads. Therefore, from the perspective of providing disaster relief, road construction is urgently needed. This is the first point. In addition to natural disasters, there are also man-made disasters. In recent years, bandits have been lurking and harassing everywhere, taking advantage of the inconvenient transportation, leaving the government troops helpless. It is difficult to advance and suppress them, and the bandit forces are becoming more and more rampant. If there is a good network of roads connecting all parts of the country, then naturally the bandit disasters can be suppressed without a fight. This is the second point. In recent years, there has been a high call to "go to the frontier" because the population in the interior is too large and life is difficult. The frontier is vast and sparsely populated, making it easier to make a living. Therefore, everyone hopes to send a portion of the people to the frontier for reclamation. However, reclamation cannot be achieved with empty words. At present, the transportation between our country's frontier and the interior can be said to be extremely isolated. To go to Yunnan, one must pass through Annam to be fast. To go to Xinjiang takes several dozen days. Recently, Red Russia built three railways connecting to the vicinity of Xinjiang from Moscow, taking only eight days. As a result, although everyone is willing to go, there is no road to take. The so-called rich resources of the frontier can only be seized by others. If there are good roads, then automobiles can reach directly, providing great convenience. People will naturally be happy to go, and the effect of reclamation can be achieved without encouragement. This is the third point. Related to the reclamation of the frontier is also the consolidation of national defense. The Chinese government has inconvenient transportation with the frontier, and in political terms, it is beyond its reach. Those fertile lands can only be allowed to be plundered. Looking at the history of various countries, those who have lost their countries often start with transportation. Germany is a militarist democratic country. Before the European War, it had already set up railway lines on the border. Later, when the war began, the German army moved to the Western Front when it was not very tense on the Eastern Front, and returned to the Eastern Front when the Western Front was relaxed, going back and forth with great convenience. Therefore, one team of men could be used as two teams. The value of transportation in military affairs is not difficult to imagine. Today, China is facing foreign aggression, and the frontiers should not be left wide open. If railways are difficult to build, roads must not be delayed. This is the fourth point. The knowledge of the Chinese people is only more developed in large cities, while the interior is still mostly very backward. This is naturally also the influence of inconvenient transportation. Because of inconvenient transportation, it is difficult for people to travel. They are stuck in one place, culture cannot be instilled, and knowledge cannot be developed. To carry out self-governance during the period of political tutelage, there must be sound civic education. From this perspective, roads are of utmost importance. This is the fifth point. Therefore, from the above five points, China's need for roads can be said to be extremely urgent. The Road Association is holding a road and city exhibition at this time, which is really the only stimulant for the people. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Selection of the Tongyu Route (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shanlang</p>
<p>(3) Comparison with the Yelanba Line: This line still goes from Yingzuiyan, through Shuikouba, Gouzimen, up to Taiba, the Erdunyan and Mei'ya on the side of Yelan, and the Jiantou'ya to Yanyan. It then reaches Ganshui via the Xiaojiupan in Sichuan. The route is slightly longer than the Xin-Song line, and the terrain rises and falls, with few flat routes. The slopes in places such as Gouzimen, Mei'ya, and Jiantou'ya are very steep, and the twists and turns are even greater. Moreover, there are few towns along the way, with only Yelan. Also, because the terrain is low, it cannot pass through the market but only passes through the Erdunyan on the mountainside. Therefore, the area through which this line passes not only has poor routes and large projects, but it is also desolate and has no prosperous markets compared to the Xin-Song route.</p>
<p>(4) Comparison with the Yangcungou and Xin-Song Riverside Line: This line goes from Maliu, through Yangcun, Lucun, Anhe, Huaqiudang, to Xinzhan. Then it follows the Xin-Song River channel, through Lianghekou and Diaoyudong, to Ganshui. The upper section of the route is located in the two-story valley behind the Shiniulan slope. Although there is a lot of cultivated land, there are overlapping gullies and excessive slopes. If the route is lowered, it will deviate to the side, and if it is raised, it will be all exposed rocks. Moreover, the Anhe River floods easily, submerging the valley and cutting off traffic. Huaqiudang is parallel to Xinzhan, and the mountain is more than 800 meters high. A lightning-shaped route of at least thirty miles is needed to reach the foot of the mountain, and it is mostly rocky, requiring huge engineering work. It is more than twenty miles longer than the first line. Therefore, this section of the route is not possible. From Xinzhan onwards, the route goes out along the river, through Songkan, Lianghekou, and Diaoyudong to Ganshui. Although the route is flat, there are many places where cliffs are opposite each other. For example, in the section from Mengdu to Chenghuangmiao, there are several cliffs. The twenty miles from Lianghekou to Diaoyudong is entirely steep cliffs. It is difficult even for railways to pass, and it is even more difficult for roads to pass. It is not as easy to build as the first line. Therefore, neither the upper nor lower sections are possible.</p>
<p>(5) Comparison of Partial Sections of the Xin-Song Line: (1) Tongguyuan Line: This line is a comparison line between Liangfengya and Shanpo. It goes straight down from Liangfengya along the ditch, through Tongguyuan and Hedu, to Shanpo. The route is more direct, but in the section from Liangfengya straight down to the ditch, there are more than ten lightning-shaped turns, with excessive twists and turns. The route is poor. There are large rocks along both ends of Hedu, and it is also next to the river. The work of blasting rocks and building embankments is quite large. It is not as flat and labor-saving as the Huaqiuping line. (2) Shiniulan Line: This line is another comparison line between Chumipu and Shanpo. It goes from Chumipu along the original road through Yaquewo, Zushiguan, Shiniulan to Mentouqing. Then it slopes down from the mountainside through Wayao ping to Shanpo, about forty miles long. Most of the entire route is rocky mountains, and there are many cliffs and deep valleys, making construction even more difficult. Moreover, the slopes in the Yaquewo and Zushiguan areas are slightly larger. The route here cannot pass without many lightning-shaped turns. Therefore, this line is not only a huge project, but the route is also poor, far inferior to the flat and labor-saving earth hills in the opposite Huaqiuping area. (3) Wangjiafen Line:</p>
<p>This line is a comparison line between Qizhenxi and Sangyuanba. It slopes up from Qizhenxi, through Hehuaping, to Wangjiafen, and then slopes down to Sangyuanba. This line was selected to avoid the tens of feet of large rocks at Chenghuang Temple. Although there is a lot of soil quality in the entire section, there are also occasional rocky mountains. From Wangjiafen onwards, it is all rock. In total, the rock embankment work in this section is almost equal to the rock embankment project at Chenghuang Temple. Moreover, the upper and lower sections of Qizhenxi and Wangjiafen both need to use lightning shapes. It is not as flat and direct as going along the river from Chenghuang Temple and blasting rocks to pass through. Although the rocks at Chenghuang Temple are large, they are no more than eighty feet long. The river surface in the lower half is wide, and the water level, even during the spring and summer floods, is no more than a few feet high. The roadbed in this half can be completely built by building embankments in the river, without blasting rocks. Only the upper half is steep and the road position is high. The river bottom is deep and the impact force is large, making it difficult to build embankments and requiring complete rock blasting. However, the rock is only forty feet long, and the cost is only a few thousand yuan. After careful consideration, it is better than the Hehuaping Wangjiafen line. One cannot sacrifice this good route because of minor difficulties. (4) Xiematai Line: This line is a comparison line between Songkan and Jiudianya. It slopes up from the Koukou field in Songkan along the left side of the mountain to Nongwan, Xiematai, Tianbasha Wangmiao, and reaches Jiudianya. It is thirty miles long, more than ten miles longer than the Bazhuaxi line. Although there are fewer exposed rocks, it seems easier to work on. However, after a few inches of topsoil, the interior and exterior of the soil are still rocks. In total, the rock embankment work on this thirty-mile section is only more than the exposed rock work on the few miles of Bazhuaxi. Moreover, the Tianba section of Xiematai is a valley with excessive slopes. There are also at least ten lightning-shaped routes. It is not as direct, labor-saving, and less winding than the Bazhuaxi line. Therefore, it was originally planned to use the Xiematai line. After detailed review, the Bazhuaxi line is still better. The Bazhuaxi line is an excellent road line from Songkan to Sichuan. Although the rocks are slightly larger and the cost is slightly higher, it is only necessary to blast a foot-wide rock inward and build a few-foot embankment outward to complete the construction of the roadbed. Once this type of rocky mountain route is completed, it can reduce maintenance work.</p>
<p>In summary, all routes should be from Xin-Song for the sake of reducing engineering work for the people. The government should also be from Xin-Song for the sake of saving expenses. For the convenience of transportation and the development of towns along the way, it should also be from Xin-Song. Therefore, the colleagues of this team spared no effort to traverse the rugged paths and overcome dangers. After many comparisons, they were able to select this route. Although they dare not say that it is a good route, there is no other route better than this one. Therefore, for this selection of the Xin-Song route, the Chongqing survey comrades expressed their sympathy after the joint survey and gave up the proposal of using Wenshui as the intersection point. It is certainly not that the surveyors have any bias or error in the selection. (End)</p>
