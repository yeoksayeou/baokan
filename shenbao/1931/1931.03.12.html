<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國保守黨與印度事件</h3>
<p>英國工黨政府之對印政策。在倫敦圓桌會議時保守黨初未反對之保守黨之重要分子邱吉爾氏。因不贊成領袖包爾温此種態度曾發表宣言。又曾集保守黨員。反對英政府處置印度事件之不當。及至今日保守黨委員與領袖包爾温氏商定之後。宣布以後保守黨不再預聞圓桌會議雖不明言反對政府之處置印事。然包爾温氏之態度。不啻己爲邱吉爾氏所屈服矣。</p>
<p>自保守黨不再預印度圓桌會議之宣言發表以後。英國報紙大抵不直包氏者多。晚旗報謂包。始則力助印督歐温。今則抛棄之。此種可異之反覆其影響己毀傷其本身與保守黨云。自由黨之星報謂一週前印度狂熱家。妨害和平之可能性。今則保守黨之狂熱家。竟欲阻塞通至和平與進取之途。以平日自詡負英國大事責任之一黨。而竟自擾動英國歷史中極大危局之一是誠不可思議云。其外各報。亦均著有批評。其國人之重視保守黨此舉蓋可推知矣國内要電二</p>

<p>▲團體領册　事務所自下日起、頒發選舉册籍用紙、通知各團體具領、連日、赴所領取册籍用紙者、有市商會及各公私立大學校等團體、頗爲踴躍、僅律師公會方面、以執行職務、多在省區範圍、故加入省區選舉、未來具領、</p>
<p>▲指導組織　關於工會方面、現由市黨部指導改組成立者、己有二十餘個、餘亦正在指導組織、教育會農會等、亦己從事組織、預信於短期内、可望成立、各種團體、俟得黨政機關證明後、本所即當正式承認、</p>
<p>▲審查公告　本所收到各項册籍後、即付審查、審查完竣、便須編製本市名册、定期公告、關於公告手續、最感困難、現計畫中者、擬於榜示之外、或印名册、或登廣告、尚望報界加以協助、此外於民會文字之宣傳、亦請儘量刋載、嘗憶民十三總理抵滬之際、曾於莫利愛路寓所、招待報界、謂國民會議之召集、必須報界方面、負多量宣傳使命、而今日即其時也、</p>
<p>約法問題　張又謂、民國十三年、廣州有國民黨特别辦事處之設立、七月間、總理曾往演講五權憲法、其澈要之數語曰、「政治上之憲法、就是支配人事的大機器、亦是調和自由與獨裁的大機器、」反復申說解剖綦詳、總理研究中外古今歷史之結果、知非實行五權憲法、則人民自由失去保障、當局獨裁不能防止、故規定軍政時期、施用軍法、訓政憲政時期、須制定約法憲法、可知在今日國民會議中制定約法、實爲最重要之使命、而爲我中華民族生死存亡之關頭云云、</p>

<h3>統稅署長謝祺糾正日文報論調</h3>
<p>國民新聞社云、上海日文日日新報、近載有社論、謂捲烟統稅、對於中外各廠所製之雪茄與紙烟、均同一待遇、此舉將令中國捲烟業受重大之打擊、而使外國商行、壟斷中國捲烟市面、又謂、棉紗統稅、對中外廠家亦同一待遇、此舉亦將令日本紗廠、於無形中享受專利權云、國民新聞社記者、曾以此事詢之財政部統稅署長謝祺、據謝君云、該日文報之所載、完全與事實不符、謝君復根據歷年之統計、證明統稅之無害於中國工業、蓋自統稅徴收以來、在民國十七年度、中國捲烟廠家所付之稅、佔捲烟稅全額百分之四十三、而民國十九年度、則己增至百分之五十六矣、謝君復謂、中國歷來不規則之賦稅、如釐金等、影響於本國商業者綦大、而外商並不受絶不之打擊、今中外工商、處</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>於平等地位、則以前之桎梏實己解除、謝氏斷又指出日文報紙、不負責任之態度、實係有若干不知謹愼之外人、欲設法使中國回復以前不規則之稅收、以陷中國工商業於不利之地位、而彼等營業可以發達云</p>

<h3>紀念偉大的總理</h3>
<p>總理是中華民國的國父、國民革命的導歸、中國國民黨的領袖、他的偉大誰都知道、誰都敬仰、當然值得我們來紀念、值得我們來崇拜、所以總理逝世、是本黨和全國的一個最大損失、同時也是全世界被壓迫民族的一個最大損失、因此我們當　總理逝世紀念日到臨的時候、全體同志、全國同胞、應有下列的認識和努力、</p>
<p>一、總理革命事業的偉大（一）三民主義的創造、當時總理看見滿清政府政治之腐敗、帝國主義之壓迫、所以認定要拯救中國、非傾覆滿清而建立民國不可、乃本先民遺留的民族思想和中外學者的民權主義、應時勢的需要、創造民族主義和民權主義、爲革命進行的目標、更欲謀一勞永逸之計、將民生問題、同時解决、故加入了一個民生主義、三民主義之創造、確定了中國革命的最高原則、實在是集世界吾國革命理論的大成、（二）組織革命黨、革命的事業、决非少數人所能完成、更非各自爲戰所能奏效、要想普遍的掀起革命的高潮、集中的從事實際的行動、必須有革命的團體、羣策羣力、以利進行、故總理在一八九三年、即着手聨絡會黨、糾合華僑、創立興中會、以謀革命事業之推進、雖其後兩次失敗、而革命思潮、瀰漫日廣、總理後又集合全國英俊、成立同盟會、從此革命風潮、一日千里、卒於辛亥之役、建立中華民國、嗣後又因内容腐敗、兩次改組、而成爲現在惟一的革命政黨、（三）建立中華民國、總理之從事革命、目的是要推翻滿清事制、建立一個民有民治民享的的獨立自由國家、從乙未之秋、開始作革命的工作後、直至辛亥武漢起義、先後至十次之多、然總理不因此而稍餒、屢仆屢起、再接再厲、卒能推翻滿清、創立民國、成就偉大的革命事業、後如袁氏之稱帝、段氏魔約、廢帝復辟、總理又在此萬分危急當中、毅然擔任巨艱、和一切反動勢力奮鬥、保存中國國民革命一線生機、樹立今日統一全國的鞏固基礎、誰爲爲之、都是總理畢生所造成的偉大革命事業</p>
<p>二·紀念　總理逝世之應有勢力（一）繼續　總理革命精神、總理是爲革命而生、爲革命而死、他在艱難困苦的環境中、爲國家自由人民利益而奮鬥、愈挫愈堅、再接再厲、卒能戰勝一切、成就偉大事業、這種「富貴不能淫·貧賤不能移·威武不能屈·」的精神、是值得我們取法的、我們必須總理的革命精神、十倍的努力、來完成這個重大的使命、（二）實現三民主義的建設、國民革命的最終目的、在實現三民主義、故當革命的破壞時期工作完畢之後、當繼之以三民主義的建設、使三民主義的理論成爲具體的國家與社會組織、</p>
<p>然後中國才有修明的政治、人民才有樂利的幸福、而國家自由平等的地位、才能達到、（三）廢除不平等條約、不平等條約、是我國的賣身契、不平等條約一天不廢除、中國一天不能自由平等、過去數年中、在外交上的努力、雖有相當的效果、但於整個的廢除不平等條約工作、尚未完全做到　總理遺囑的垂示、正是今日不可或緩的工作、所以紀念、總理逝世、尤不可忘記了這一項切要的工作、</p>
<p>▲標語　一·紀念總理偉大的人格、二·紀念　總理革命精神、三·完成總理革命的事業、四·一致擁護中央、鞏固黨的基礎、五·肅清建設障碍、安定社會秩序、六·厲行地方自治、完成訓政建設、七·誓遵　總理遺教、取消不平等條約、八·三民主義萬歳、九·中國國民黨萬歳、十·中華民國萬歳、</p>

<h3>工部局候選外董談話</h3>
<p>▲一致主張購入大華飯店</p>
<p>▲可注意之越界築路問題</p>
<p>工部局候選董事安諾爾白朗及福島、昨對西報記者發表彼等對收購大華飯店地産、出賣工部局現有建築、東區與北區添闢曠地及越界築路等問題之意見如下、　　▲白朗氏之意見　白朗對收購大華</p>
<p>地産及出賣工部局現有建築問題、未表示何種意見、彼云、此事現正在討論中、至北區與東區添闢空曠場地一事、彼極端贊成、蓋在工事區域中、固甚需要空曠塲地也、白氏對越界築路問題、以爲最好與中國當局交涉、並謂工部局已開始交涉、尚未得要領、彼甚贊成工部局之公開政策、與歇泊特之意見相同、</p>
<p>安諾爾之意見　安氏對于收買大華地産之議、以爲目前大華飯店地址、雖距上海之中心點較遠、然在將來之變遷中、大華鄰近、可成爲上海之中心點、彼以爲此問題與東區北區添闢空曠塲地一事、同爲目前要圖、安氏對于越界築路問題、以爲在未有相當解决辦法之前、應有臨時辦法、以便修理道路、因少數道路、已呈危險之狀、彼對于局内重要職員、常與新聞記者發表談話、深不以爲然、蓋此最易引起外界懷疑某人之談話是否代表工部局、抑或爲其個人之意見、</p>

<h3>誌周水平烈士</h3>
<p>— 朱美予</p>
<p>烈士姓周名水平。江蘇江陰顧山鄉人也。幼時遊學東瀛。自爲國民黨黨員後。對於本黨多所奔走。尤致力於農民運動焉。民國十四年冬。烈士集農民組織佃户自救會。要求减輕田租。以謀農民之解放當時孫傳芳盤踞江蘇。國民黨猶未公開。致遭紳劣三十八人之忌。誣爲赤化。控諸省方。逮捕下獄。聞者爲烈士危。早知其不免摧殘於軍閥鐵蹄之下也。</p>
<p>紳劣三十八人旣以赤化控烈士於省方、。其時官廳對黨員恨之剌骨。故於烈士咸抱致之死地而甘心之慨。乃處以梟首極刑於江陰市橋堍。并懸首三日於縣政府　照壁示衆。時十五年一月十七日上午六時事也。過者莫不掩面涙下。慘矣。</p>
<p>烈士旣死。國軍南下抵蘇。江陰人士同深憤慨。遂組織周案委員會專辦此案。電省請求通緝要犯三十八人。而要犯等早己聞風遠颺。此案乃久懸未了者將届五載矣。烈士寃魂。其不瞑目乎。</p>
<p>胡樸安長民政。以周案久懸不了。烈士寃魂。無從申雪。乃擬定辦法二條。於省黨政雙方通過。决定由省府執行。責成沙炳元等三十八人。各出資二千元。并指定五萬元作周水平紀念小學基金。餘二萬六千元作爲修墓撫恤之用、轟動全國久懸不了之周案。至此乃告結束焉。</p>
<p>余與烈士相居僅隔一江。故於烈士生平聞之較詳。爰誌之如此。</p>
<h3>王曉籟之自警聨</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>上海市商會主席委員王曉籟。歷任烟酒麥粉等特稅局局長。最近由宋部長薦任爲上海造幣廠廠長。禀性豪爽。熱心公益。有子女數十。故其諢號曰多子王。公餘袍笏登塲。以資消遣。唱黑頭。别署得天。聲若洪鐘。能戲頗多。咸謂其嗓子之高。得天獨厚。昨與會晤。據云。近撰一聨。以自警惕。文曰。「爲國家。爲社會。爲此爲官爲商。皆爲人作嫁。莫問到底爲什麽。」「不愛錢。不惜財。不但不貪不姦。且不顧生計。恐怕將來不得了。」已請方椒伯君書就。以便懸諸座右。表示自病自得知云。</p>
<h3>英國火車中之無線電話</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>在火車中旅行。除看書閱報之外。恒苦無物以資消遣。新近英國火車。爲供乘客娱樂起見。物於客車之内。座位之旁。裝設無線電話。法良意善。似足供我國之借鏡。因節譯其情形。以實本談。</p>
<p>英國上午十時十分由金司克勞施開往利池及下午五時三十分由利池開往金司克勞施之火車。其中乘客均得享受無線電話之娱樂。各車内部。裝有多數塞門。接通車守室内之收音機。客之欲聆者。祇須破費一先令。向侍者取一聽筒。用撲落挿入塞門。即可聞清晰之歌唱矣。</p>
<p>聽筒外沿。有木匣以資保護。所以免車行震盪。觸損機械也。天線長約三十英尺。高懸車頂之上。試騐之頃。成績甚佳。惟車身在地道中行駛時。因外來電浪。備受隔蔽。故收音亦隨而低沉。聞加拿大國家鐵道公司。特創立電台。廣播音樂報告。規定時刻。專供火車乘客之遣岑寂。其用意殊周密云。</p>
<h3>焦山遊屑</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>余前記金山之遊。刋於本談。本月一日。友人聶君爲其太夫人稱觴於鎭江。因往祝壽。並得遊覽焦山。據同行諸人談。均謂鎭江名勝。焦優於金。爰略記斯遊所得。藉留一時鴻爪。</p>
<p>金山佛殿。以莊嚴宏大擅勝。一登焦山。則又覺不同。焦山除大殿外。對宇望衡。均屬精寺小庵。曲徑通幽。佈置異常雅潔。庵各有名。若碧山。若自然。林林總總。令人不勝記憶。庵之建築。環繞江邊。登臨遠眺。江景全收。且佛像不多。而名人字畫則觸目盡是。其中以莊藴寛之手聿爲最多。陸潤庠徐世昌之對聨亦不少。聞諸寺僧談。自國府定都南京。省府遷至鎭江。焦山名勝。遂多要人蹤跡。年來着意整飾。所費不貲云。</p>
<p>焦山寺僧。除禮佛外。並出售碑帖書畫。據聞此中有若干和尚。均擅文晨。斯日所見。亦類多清談娓娓。不取人厭。售畫之庵。陳列頗富。有作八仙雀戲圖者。神采生動。用筆亦尚工細。所標售價。爲三元餘。餘若焦山志焦處士遺集等。均可索觀。不過代價頗昻。每部率在四元以上也。</p>
<p>山上石壁。滿目琳瑯。到處可見刋字。山有石工。預備遊山者之招用。詩文口占。頃刻間即能付鑿。我國社會人士。每好到處留名。石工即利用此種心理。以事生活。終年收入。殊頗可觀。亦焦山上之好營業也。</p>
<p>焦山多珍物。非佳客寺僧不肯輕示。是日余儕登枕江閣時。得覩佛像三尊。佛屏一座。曁古端硯多方。皆名品也佛像各用水晶香檀象牙雕成。皆作如來之端坐。高不滿尺。而刻術殊工。屏中有象牙片。上鐫佛極細。且數千字題贊。在方寸遍刻。尤爲難能。未知出於何人之手也。此外尚有龍袍一襲據云係清代帝皇眞物因時晏未及一觀。當留待下次之賞鑑矣。</p>
<h3>麋臺思舊錄</h3>
<p>— 夢鴛</p>
<p>鐘樓在葑門内唐家巷東。距余家甚近。樓凡三層。上層懸一巨鐘。中層供梓潼神像。相傳舊歷二月初三。爲神誕日。遠近士人。多有來拈香者。下層則爲僧侣供設佛像處余幼時五更夢回。聞有鏗然之聲。入於耳鼓者。即樓上僧侣鳴鐘聲也。後忽不戒於火。惟是樓建築甚堅固。故其中木質物。雖焚燬無餘。而外面墻垣。依然完好。迄今如乘舟過葑門。見有巨大之建築物。映入眼簾者。即是樓之遺址也。惟鐘聲則不復可聞矣。余嘗有句詠之曰。「傑閣巍峨奉梓潼。笑他迷信到章逢。自從一炬齊雲燬。無復鐘聲颺晚風。」</p>
<p>故老相傳。蘇州有七塔八幢九饅頭之說。七塔者。謂北寺塔瑞光塔上方塔虎邱塔靈巖塔及雙塔也。雙塔在葑門内雙塔寺巷。西鄰貢院。爲前清督學使者試士處余嘗有句咏之曰。「欲從文陣掃千軍。鎖院耽吟向夕曛。搭影忽從檐際落。雙雙健筆勢凌雲。」今則貢院已頽廢。即雙塔亦將傾圯矣。</p>
<p>桃花菴在桃花塢。爲明唐子畏先生讀書處余幼時曾一度過之。菴中有園。植桃數十株。有亭供子畏像余最愛先生閒來寫幅丹靑賣不使人間造孽錢之句。嘗有句咏之曰。「桃花菴裏桃花放。當日曾經住謫仙。只寫丹靑爲活計。眞名士肯飲貪泉。」蓋雖不能至。心嚮往之焉。</p>
<p>錦帆涇。在護龍街飲馬橋與夏侯橋之間。昔吳王夫差與西施遊此。船上悉張錦帆。故取以爲名。余幼時見此涇。己狹小如溝。及市政府設立。因夏侯橋頗高峻。行車不便。創議拆平之。遂併河道塡塞。於是此狹小如溝之錦嵩涇遺跡。不可得見矣。余嘗有句咏之曰。「錦帆涇裏錦帆遊。宫女如花不識愁。今日騷人來弔古。幾疑陸地可行舟。」</p>

<h3>心上温馨（三八○）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>花元春的病勢來得兇猛。起初是頭暈嘔吐。發燒得很勵害。大肚皮阿金以姑娘們受了一點感冒。是無足爲奇的事。給伊泡了一碗薑湯。加放了一些紅糖。說是也許月經來了吧。到第二天寒熱更厲害。甚而至於　語不絶。所說的全是憶念着上海的那班人。大肚皮阿金說只怕遇着了什麽邪了。照我們南邊人規矩。也要去起起課。送送客人。北方連看香頭的也没有的。請了一位常常在胡同裏看病的大夫來。他說大概是受了。一點兒寒。南邊姑娘没有北邊姑娘那般身體結實。開了一張疏散的方子。到了第三天。寒熱不退。嘔吐更甚。一點没有吃東西。胸中煩躁。那一天晚上。葉桐侯從天津來了。臨去的時候。花老六託他剪兩件衣料。他便帶了這衣料。到慶餘堂來。一踏進門。夥計便告訴他六小姐病了。走進屋子裏去。就是老六呌伊去當白金手表的那個阿金組。見了葉桐侯。說道。三少。我們頭頸也望酸了。你怎麽到這時候纔來。六小姐的病。蠻厲害呀。寒熱沸沸燙。夜裏還要胡說胡話。我是嚇得來。伊清爽的時候還問我。弗曉得三少阿來。葉桐侯點點頭。說那末讓我去看看伊吧。他們把三間正屋。上首一間夾開。是老六的臥室。中間和下首一間是統間。阿金姐陪了葉三。揭開了門帘進進去。就嗅着一陣病人房間裏的氣息。那時候。己經在深秋初冬的時候。北方天氣冷得早。漸有凄寒之意。花老六蓋了一床杏子紅的絲綿被。還加上一條鴛鴦紅的羊毛毯兒。蒙頭而睡。阿金姐走近前去。向枕畔低語道。六小姐。你牽記的三少來了。花老六微微呻吟一聲。葉桐侯道。伊倘然睡着了。不用唤醒伊。我反正没有事。外面坐一晌好了。原來葉桐侯也怕留滯在病人的房間。一個姑娘病了。就鬼也没有上門。那種凄冷的景况。使人難受。花老六睡的一張半銅床。床前几上。有一盞電燈。是個綠磁的燈罩。本來己經發出一種幽凄的光。再加着那時北京的電燈。光力不足。更顯得闇澹幽沉。如入鬼墟。葉桐侯正想走出去。忽聽得花元春嚶然一聲。從被窩裏伸出一隻手來。又潑落在被頭上。阿金姐連忙給伊推進被禍裏去。老六細微無力的問道。葉三少嗎。阿金姐道。三少從天津來。你託他剪的衣料也帶來了。</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市步步上漲</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日到船仍見稀落、市銷續佳、北帮白粳有包子囤胃交易、因此市價又好角外、但午市形勢淡、進户買意轉　、是以後情漸平矣、薄銷化活動、步緊一角、羊秈杜秈去路不一、行情高提尺許、次升近尺、通變隂化到接銷平、大盤微堅半角之　、</p>
<p>▲滬南　昨日内地到船十餘號、本街銷化仍暢、常蘇等白粳亦因有囤户落手、續昻兩角、然胃口一滿、市必下游、是以貨客賣性頗爽也、南帮薄稻早稻情况由堅趨穏、價格曾漲角左洋杜尖市胃轉只、晨初抬上角餘、午即呈平定之象、白元走銷尚可酒胃揀高動辦、盤面見昻一角許</p>
<h3>粉價暴落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、又一致呈暴落之象、以洋麥報價、己回小一角零、金市之空象、亦回跌甚勁、兼之天時佳　、全部分之人心、遂均爲之轉移、蓋交易所之底碼、目下之總成交、己達一千一百萬包外、十分之七八、均屬廠家以如是多量之貨額業外之需要、當然可暫而不可久、其時又傳廠家續有定成洋麥、一票聞　四兩零四分、二票則祗四兩所以上下兩市、又接續狂抛、數在五十　以上至全日之成交額、則達一百四十萬左右故市氣均步步回落、一無回顧觀此後之局面如滙率再　、仍看繼跌也、結果本月份較前日跌一分半、四五月份跌二分七厘半、六七八月份跌二分二厘云、</p>
<h3>麥市疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各日份市面均見疲落之象、以洋麥報價旣微小、天時又良好、全部分之市氣、己無形爲環境所軟化不過獲利之多頭、鑒於市面到此低價、一時抵補者、頗形洶湧、所以臨時空頭、雖亦極暢尚足抵住、故形勢雖一致看跌跌度　無幾也、依照最近趨勢、如果各月份之籌碼、再續有增加、深恐國外之過剩慘象、將在本埠一見之也、結果本月份較前日小二分、四月份小三分五六月份小四分、七月份小五分、八月份小四分云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂糖頻跌未己</h3>

<h3>閘北貨　金針菜銷滯轉降</h3>
<p>金針菜近以走塲呆滯、市價轉鬆、如銷胃最大之廣帮近來亦僅零星交易、其餘各帮去路更細、故行盤遂漸見降、昨市頂莊菜售二十五兩大興菜廿三兩至廿二兩半、以次二十一兩半至十九兩、最次莊十六兩、趨勢平疲、非得銷胃暢旺、恐雖轉機云、</p>
<h3>絲茶廠經電轉價報漲</h3>
<p>▲惜外匯步長···未免稍受影響</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、轉趨漲勢、查歐美市塲華絲價上升、黄白廠經電轉價均報漲、惜外匯步長、扯合華銀依然明漲暗疲、昨由信孚等進滬曰廠經五十包、開利等進川黄廠經四十包、價仍不振云、</p>
<h3>川長吐開價續漲</h3>
<p>▲高貨己至一百七十五兩</p>
<p>邇來黄白長吐、歐銷雖難暢達、而滬埠高貨存底不充價仍看漲、加之匯市步長、昨市信孚等進川長吐八十担、市面益呈俏俐、高貨價己漲至一百七十五兩云、</p>
<h3>婺源珍眉英銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日婺源高莊珍眉綠茶、英莊錦降保昌協和天祥等行均有零星進胃、俄國協動會對於屯溪婺東之貨、亦復開辦、惟售開市盤、高莊貨售價自七十餘兩至一百兩、中莊貨售盤五六十兩、較前均低二三兩針眉秀眉等項、白頭行家尚有零星需求但存底稀少、並無大宗交易、其餘貨熙珠茶等貨、均無市面云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　金市暴落下之蛋頭市</h3>
<p>▲開價步跌···實銷呆滯</p>
<p>疋頭市面、邇受金市狂跌之影響、昨日益形不振、人心甚虚、實銷之清淡、爲近所罕見、惟西貨尚能站定、蓋存底不多、嗣後來源尚遥遥無期、故執貨者心思仍高、漂布絲毫未跌、條干板綾反漲、己須三錢、素府綢下身貨達五錢左右、東貨大有一蹶不振之象、昨祇達麽白厚絨仍三錢一分、童子樂縐紋呢三錢二分半、市尚挺拔、餘者莫不下落元洋沙小二錢半、點秋香開十一兩、寒山寺十兩零九錢、喇叭美人十兩零五錢半、直貢呢亦見步軟、獨冲素綢未見下落、靑島帮需要甚股、可愛札藍於四兩八錢售　、綸昌貨四兩六錢半、但至昨因存　呈無處豐羅之狀、棉法　·中山呢·細嗶嘰·印花直貢呢均略下落、觀察後市、倘金價續跌、疋頭市面亦難進展也、</p>
<h3>五金英鋼板跌風猛烈</h3>
<p>五金交易、自外滙放長後、各帮買賣益覺清淡、蓋存貨者心思恐慌、　銷愈勸、致買方更不敢貿然下手、而標準因有人操縱、益覺萎頓、昨如英鋼板跌　猛烈、計達兩許之多、計二厘半售九兩二錢半、半分七兩三錢、七厘半六兩七錢半、一分六兩四五錢、較之紅盤行情鬆動六七錢至一兩一錢半不等、聞交易除天津帮及本埠廠家略有添辦外、其餘悉無成交、　觀市氣之散淡恐來日行情又重跌之象、法西釘馬口鐵等因市貨枯竭、尚能擯持不動、其餘若白鐵·白鐵瓦·新鉛絲·烟皮鐵等、無一不在回跌中、聞海外定價則己趨漲、蓋亦因滙市趨長之關係也、一般同業爲預防漲價計、均紛紛訂定、所以近兩日來海外買賫堪云十分興旺云、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>（補續頁石爾之戰）</p>
<p>後來曉得這路綫有一段經過高出平地三英尺半到四英尺半的堤壩、那末我們爲怎不把在但基克週圍順利的溢水計劃也在這裏頁石爾河岸施行呢、</p>
<p>倘使此計可以實行、在這河與鐵路間二英里到三英里的一片土地、不致委諸敵人、至於潰溢的水流到了堤防停留、更足爲士卒的防禦、無論如何、猛烈砲火下的退却、軍心大亂、最重要的要有一條聨絡不斷的路綫可供兵士重集改編、兵士稍得地利之宜是願意聽命的、灌水計劃完成了之後這鐵路很能有這樣的帮助</p>
<p>因此我在二十四的晚上離開佛爾内斯的時候、就同比軍參謀部約定停止退却和沿鐵路綫佈防、並且與比軍參謀部講妥海水損害這大好河山雖非一時所可换回、溢水的計劃是必須實行的、</p>
<p>至於葛羅什梯將軍、他從坡佛西司令部發給我下列堅决的電信、「我不知第四十二師明天能有幾多人生還、不過有一兵一卒存留着、誓不使德軍越鐵路半步、</p>
<p>我們又將以疲兵再戰了、這次作戰是沿牛埠狄思莫特路綫、法軍支隊的開到兩端和葛羅什梯的隊伍在坡佛西遏守中央大大的鞏固了防綫、前面灌水增防、更以重兵把守牛埠的水閘、現在的問題就是洪水的蔓延開展要多少時間能佈開到多少面積、在過去的經騐上找不出答案、因爲這水力防守計劃要使海水流到海濱以助防禦、這點始終無從確定、在全部防線也發生同樣的影響、</p>
<p>二十五日、比利士軍隊沿堤壩列陣、二十六日德軍的砲火重新轟擊、砲彈直落到鐵路線、防軍又覺得岌岌不可終日、但是他們仍舊信托升上來的海水做他們的救星、二十五的晚上、比軍參謀部報告狄思莫特的羅那煦海軍司令、「在頁石爾河的左岸灌水淹没狄思莫特牛埠與頁石爾河之間的區域、」一切佈置妥善、應當特别設法防備水的蔓延到我們的軍隊、須把路軌下一切陰溝塞没、又須把若干運河的河岸、挖開好讓海水源源流進、</p>
<p>直到二十七的晚上、這類的工作遂告完成、牛埠的水閘就在漲潮的時候開啓、退潮的時候關閉、以後每天是這樣、二十八日、海水流到披佛西附近的鐵路線、且仍向南蔓延、但是敵人的前進並不因此停頓、他們的計劃也不因此改變、二十九日、敵人接接連連向拉斯口方面猛烈進攻、不過他們不能入據那村莊、三十日晨、敵人看見海水衝到他們的後方、他們努力攻擊、佔領了拉斯口、得着了結實的高地、倘使他們能固守這塊地方、再能衝出、那末海水淹没區域後面的地方盡入他們的掌握、鐵路的提壩不保、甚至於我們全部防守計劃都被推翻、所以無論如何、我們必須奪回拉斯口、葛羅什梯將軍立刻見到此點、遂下令會同比軍從乍亞夫斯薛沙爾斯·和西内加萊斯反攻、即在黄昏前把那村莊克復、</p>
<p>翌日三十一日、再沿鐵路完全重新佈防、我們前面的水愈積愈深、除幾處之外、敵人己退過頁石爾河、支配灌水計劃的水閘設在牛埠、我們把守得十分穏固、在鐵路的另一端就是在狄思莫特、我們的海軍陸戰隊也是頑强抵抗、從今以後頁石爾河的左岸這兩處間的區域德軍莫想染指、沿海岸到但基克和楷萊的路己是封閉了、</p>
<p>是役相持十天之久、德軍砲火之猛烈向來所未有、他們的步兵也是十分興奮、他們的砲隊不算在内、敵人這次進攻所用的兵力爲第三及第二十二後備軍團·一個倭什兹師·和一個郎特偉爾旅、我們作戰部隊爲比軍六師·我們的第四十二師·和海軍陸戰隊、德軍是完全失敗了、（未完）</p>

<h3>紐約職業婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>（一）紐約近代梅加</p>
<p>紐約、世界上唯一的大城市、那里有千仞巨厦、高冲霄漢、深淵墜道、直入地心、海涯天角整千萬的庶民、都匯集到這個地方來、紐約實在是新世界的大城門、當然、在這種地方、每列火車從遠的近的地方開來、其中必定裝載着具有熱望的女子、决心到來廣廣眼界、並且想在這個文化的旋渦裏得到勝利、那是很不足爲奇的、在紐約城裏、這種女子常想、生活必須向上而格外的燦爛、紐約是成功的和浪漫的去處、像這樣大小的一個城市、當常有新的田地呌人去征服、新的光景可看、還有新的朋友可以結交、</p>
<p>紐約是靑年人的園地、最偉大的就　年輕人、所謂習俗遺傳、簡實不成爲一個名詞、懦弱的人在紐約决不能得到憐惜、凡是不能在這個大城市裏奮鬥的、結果必定被排擠出來、苦思渴望具有熱忱的女子、急起直追自命不凡的女子、各式各樣的人都到紐約去、把伊們的靑春抛擲在那火熖龕裏、作爲犧牲、因此也有許多女子願意忘懷一切、自然在這個可驚的城市裏、伊對於自己的生活度日能夠自爲消長、或者她希望紐約能給伊最大的禮物、就是忘懷、</p>
<p>關於紐約最堪驚異的、就是無論怎樣的事情都能碰到、近代小說叙述出身低微的女子、怎樣在紐約得勢、不一而足、可是悲慘的事情也屈指難數、從前有一支歌曲、描寫紐約最爲逼眞、裏面說、「百老匯上每一條光線都是傷心的、」凡是在紐約己經成功的婦女、别人所聽到關於她的事、就非常之多、報章和雜誌上常把那動人的故事登載出來、住在小城鎭裏的女子們、見了這種紀載、誰都想把自己的命運、到這個旋渦裏來一試、至於失敗的婦女們、怎樣揮灑眼涙、怎樣茹苦飲辛、那種故事、並後有刋登出來、觀衆們也不歡喜讀苦惱的紀載、除非結局是快樂的、終生住在小城鎭裏的女子們、往往　不到紐約的情况、在那裏無論伊生病健康、快樂痛苦、後有人曉得他、也後有人去留心她、所以紐約的生活突然是很特殊的、即使在最自足的女子、也很難做一個快捷而滿足的生活哩、</p>
<p>凡是女子往紐約求生活的、不論從事務上或社交上看起來、她所遇到的另有一種新的環境、幻影終歸消滅、紐約决不是理想家的天堂、或者聰明伶俐與通達世故兩者、能夠代替靑年人的幻夢、婦女們與世相搏、在紐約奪到生活、纔曉得奮鬥的滋味和方式、向女人們講紐約求生的困難、至少能夠阻止她們前去、每個女子這樣想、「我是不同的、」「我生就一個好命運、」那一個敢說不是呢、有幾個女子僥倖跳過失望和詛喪、不過這是一種常軌的例外罷了、</p>
<p>許多宣傳從好萊塢發出來、呌女子們不要輕易前去、如非她的經濟能夠支持伊過活兩三年、因之美貌出衆的女子們不像往年的像潮湧般的擁擠在攝影塲了、紐約將來恐怕也要採取這種辦法、當然、從實際上講起來、紐約地方有整千累萬的職業給婦女們安身、一個位置終能找得的、對婦女們說、「不要到紐約來、」這話好像不很公允、還不如　她倔來靜待時機罷、這個意思就年輕的新來者、必定要有充足的金錢、至少可以度過一個月的時光、</p>
<p>科學家對於人事的所謂幸運者、雖然加以非笑、然而在商業塲中、免不掉所謂相當的時機與適宜的地位、何以名之、只好稱之爲幸運、有幾個女子一到紐約、很僥倖的就找到位置、這大概是她們知道怎樣去找一個位置罷、要在紐約尋一個職業、不是一件容易的事、不過那里有幾種方法是很有效的、個人的接觸所助極多、凡是女子從外鄉到紐約找事的、本鄉朋友所給伊的介紹信、倒也不容忽視哩、</p>
<p>婦女們如果没有投身、職業的門路、那末報紙上的徴求欄、與職業介紹所都可擇尤去得、紐約有幾家報紙的徴求欄内容非常出色、高尚的位置往往能在報紙裏找到、凡是後有行名地址的廣告、最好不要去應徴、好在紐約的報紙非常留意、所登的總是有聲名行家的廣告、然而也不能不稍加注意、新到紐約的人、伊買了一份晨報仔細將她所要應徴的位置廣告劃出來、她第一就注意到最好的位置、不過應徴廣告往往要等上許多時候、纔能當面去接洽、接洽的時候先到先談、所以伊起得要早、如果等了大半天後有結果、那没那個位置也許有人了、有幾家大商店、不到午後不接見找尋戰業的人、</p>
<p>紐約城裏有幾百家職業介紹所、有幾家是專眼於一種行業的、　如書記介紹所、大學畢業生及教　介紹所等、如果找尋職業的女子有特種學問的、不妨去找她所擅長的一種專門介紹所、介紹所也常在報紙上登廣告、凡是找尋一個職業位置、他的不二法門便是早字、所以尋事云者、就是早起身的代名字、職業介紹所對謀業者常取一種手續費、這是法律上所許的、在紐約如果介紹所成就了一個卓越的位置、他可以徴取第一個禮拜的薪金作爲酬勞、這種手續費也不分期拔付、如果所成就的是一個暫時的位置、那末百分之十的佣錢己夠了、凡是婦女們自己能找到一個位置、這種費用就可省去、</p>
<p>紐約的大百貨商店·大銀行·保險公司·旅館等、都是自己有職業僱用部、應徴的書信必須整潔通達、更不要存着畏怯的心理、最後講得找尋位置、年輕的婦女們必須立意在世界上力圖自立竤紐約、近代的梅加、伊伸出了巨大的臂膊接引全國的靑年、牠對靑年婦女們說、「到紐約來｜但是到了那里不要企望有倚有靠、」凡是答應這個呼聲的人、必須勇往直前、自謀立脚點的站住、（待續）</p>
<h3>告我女同胞</h3>
<p>— 謝冰</p>
<p>親愛的姊妹們、中國婦女、屈服在封建社會之下、己有數千年的歷史了、經過那畏期的　　和束縛、可憐底早己奄奄一息、我們的命運都控制在有權勢力者的掌握下、不特没有身體和意志的自由、且給與男性爲操有生殺予奪之權的主宰、女子過着如同加上珈瑣關在監獄裏的囚犯一樣的生活、</p>
<p>不料霹靂一聲忽在近三十年中、受了物理上自然的公例所支配、做成壓力愈大、反抗力也愈强的現像、因此隨着政治革命的怒潮洶湧澎湃、竟喊出「自由」、「平等」、「參政」……等口號、這不能不爲我們光榮前途的預賀、但是在狂激的反抗潮流中、和不安定的過渡時代中、眞理往往會被狂暴和虚僞的烟霞朦霧所籠罩、結果弄到「名義上的平等」、「假的平等」到手、便以爲心滿意足、歡呼跳躍、沈醉而不知前途、所以有許多受了高等教育的姊妹們、還說着、現在法律不是平等嗎教育不是平等嗎、機會不是平等嗎、我們用不着再要求「解放」和「參政」等運動了、唉、帶着有色的眼鏡說話、這種是何等的錯誤、連自身的利害關係、還没有弄清礎、何等痛心、難怪近年來全國的婦女竟沈沈寂寂而不發一言了、</p>
<p>親愛的姊妹們、我們現在還未得到眞解放於萬一呀、我這個理由、可分爲「社會」和「政治」兩方面去觀察、第一社會方面、我們一大部分的女同胞、仍是被舊禮教所桎梏、過着牛馬不如的生活、</p>
<p>還有一部分、則思想不澈底的女子爲花言巧語的男性引誘入玩物的牢籠中而不自覺者、不知凡幾、他們每每遇着薄有虚名、空有聲勢的他、就被虚榮所驅、像燈蛾撲在火熖中、至死不悟、不過貪着一時物質的快、樂愛着一時假意的温全、把自己聖潔的身體、供獻給魔王魚肉、她們口唱廢妾、而自己却做了人家的妾、這是多麽痛心的事情呢、</p>
<p>所以從前誘惑婦女的他們把女子壓到很底的而露出兇惡的面孔來對待、那時候因爲女子没有覺悟、没有抵抗的能力、所以就成了賤視女性的社會、現在女性自覺了要脫離殘忍的束縛了、於是他們則改變方針、一反往日的壓迫、用甜密的温意、把她們心醉魂迷的捧到九宵雲外、「蔑視女性的程度却和從前一樣、不過變些方式罷了」、使她們驕傲、使她們情願落在他的圈套中失了抵抗力、這多麽可笑可哭的一椿事、</p>
<p>上述兩因、是受着不良的社會和不良的經濟制度影響的結果、第二政治方面、我們從最近規定的法律條文、固然女　子己經得到進一步的地位、但如最近國府　佈之命令、准於本年五月開國民會議、然國民會議的選舉法中、只限於職業團體、在政府方面、以爲國民不分性别、但中國職業開放、教育開放爲時尚淺、女子之服務社會者、一經與男性比例、何止相差千萬里、以此次之規定、將來選舉之結果、一定完全落選、這是無可疑義的事實問題、</p>
<p>但事有未明我婦女利害關係者或說、女子之參加職業者少、女子應自負其責、這話在表面看來、似乎不錯、但細究其實、是完全錯誤、如果要這樣說的話、那從前被宗法社會壓迫的女子、也是自身問題、謂與政治制度無涉可乎、何必革命、又何必經孫總理手中規定扶助女權發展之黨綱、當女子能力未足、羽毛未豐時、當然要有相當之扶助、始可以符合孫總理之全民政治、全民革命之遺教、如以爲我的話過分的、不妨引例以證明之、假如中國現在要與列强訂立内河航行之互惠條約、在表面上看來、則冠冕堂皇、彼此平等相待、實則己上了外人的大當、受了經濟侵略而不自知了、這是什麽原故呢、因爲外國工業發達、航業盛行、中國則工業落後、談不上航業競爭、此刻我們訂了互惠的條約、結果只是盡量供外人之船隻、通行四境、外國海岸、則不見中國船隻的影子、中國徒負互惠之虚名、於不知不覺中任人侵略就是了、這種情形多麽吃虧、須知互惠條約者、祇可立於勢均力敵的條約之下、除此之外、我再來引一個例子、以申明之、假使現在如有一位體格强健的人、對一位久病的人說、我倔衣食游戲、機會均等、你何不起來享受呢、但是走動不前、食難下咽的病人、如何能有享受一切的機會、徒然使他傷心吧了、如果這位健全的人有誠意待他的話、一定要扶助他、體恤他、讓他恢復健康、才是眞正的互助、</p>
<p>即今日中國在表面上看來、男女參政權雖則平等、但以職業爲選舉的單位而論、有職業之女子、可算少之又少、呌他用什麽方法可以有代表的資格、有　言申訴的機會呢、又如今日我們的婦女就是和這兩譬喻相彷彿、可說社會的人們、就是没有什麽誠意來扶助我們眞正的解放、</p>
<p>親愛的姊妹們、在這傳　平　一情勢之下、祇有我們努力學間、自求團結、自求努力、因爲要平等互惠、必先要把自己造成了和他們同一的高低、「假平等」的情形、那時才可消滅、親愛的姊妹們、努力勉旃、</p>

However, there are still several important points that are far apart. Our side insists firmly and cannot retreat. This time, the abolition of consular jurisdiction is to seek a complete solution and cannot be piecemeal, seeking a false reputation and leaving future troubles.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The British Conservative Party and the Indian Issue</h3>
<p>The British Labour Party government's policy towards India: During the London Round Table Conference, the Conservative Party initially did not oppose it. However, Churchill, an important member of the Conservative Party, issued a declaration because he did not agree with the leader Baldwin's attitude. He also gathered Conservative Party members to oppose the inappropriate handling of the Indian issue by the British government. As of today, after the Conservative Party Committee and leader Baldwin agreed, they announced that the Conservative Party will no longer participate in the Round Table Conference. Although it does not explicitly oppose the government's handling of Indian affairs, Baldwin's attitude is tantamount to yielding to Churchill.</p>
<p>Since the Conservative Party's declaration that it will no longer participate in the Indian Round Table Conference was issued, most British newspapers have been critical of Baldwin. The Evening Standard said that Baldwin initially strongly supported Indian Governor Irwin but now abandons him. This strange reversal has damaged himself and the Conservative Party. The Liberal Party's Star newspaper said that a week ago, Indian fanatics hindered the possibility of peace, but now Conservative Party fanatics want to block the path to peace and progress. It is truly inconceivable that a party that usually prides itself on being responsible for major British affairs is actually disrupting one of the greatest crises in British history. Other newspapers have also made criticisms. It can be inferred that the people of that country attach great importance to this move by the Conservative Party.</p>

<h3>New Constitution Not Established</h3>
<p>Gandhi Vows Not to Return to Ashram</p>
<p>Conservative Party's Attitude Towards Britain is Fickle</p>
<p>Newspaper Commentary Criticizes as Political Rebel</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Ahmedabad, 10th - A year ago, Gandhi vowed that he would never return to his ashram here until the Round Table Conference established a constitution recognized by the All-India Congress. A reporter met Gandhi today and, referring to his previous oath, asked if he would now go to his ashram. Gandhi replied that he could not because the people in the ashram would expel him. He must wait until the constitution is completed before returning to the ashram. At present, he can only live anywhere where there is food to eat. The reporter also asked what he would do if the All-India Congress convened in Karachi rejected his agreement with the Viceroy of India. Gandhi replied that if this happened, they would not ask him to attend the second Round Table Conference.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Allahabad, 11th - Nehru, President of the All-India Congress, said in a speech here today that if the Karachi Congress resolves to participate in the Round Table Conference, it will participate on the condition that Indians enjoy complete independence and management, including financial management. Otherwise, the battle will be actively resumed. ▲Reuters, Bombay, 10th - Several All-India Congress inspectors at the largest foreign cloth market here were severely beaten by the crowd while interfering with merchants selling foreign cloth. The local cloth merchants association decided to temporarily close the market to wait for Gandhi to arrive here on the 16th. The association hopes that the so-called peaceful inspection in the Owen-Gandhi agreement can be discussed at that time so that foreign cloth can be sold.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - Conservative Party officials issued a statement saying that the Conservative Party has decided not to participate in the Indian Round Table Conference again. They said that if it is really necessary to hold the Round Table Conference again in India in the future, the Conservative Party will not oppose it in principle. However, for procedural reasons, they cannot agree to holding this conference at this time. The Conservative Party believes that the Indian atmosphere is not suitable for this kind of conference, and the investigation that the government promised before the second Round Table Conference has not yet begun. The Conservative Party leader's decision is not a declaration of a new policy, but only Baldwin's opinion after considering due process. Tonight, various newspapers published criticisms, which shows the seriousness of the Conservative Party's change of policy. The Evening Standard said that Baldwin first vigorously helped Viceroy Owen of India, but now he has abandoned him, calling it an insult that can constitute treason, which is not an exaggeration. This strange reversal by Baldwin has already damaged himself and the Conservative Party. The Liberal Party's Star said that a week ago, Indian fanatics hindered the possibility of peace, but today Conservative Party fanatics want to block the road to peace and progress. It is inconceivable that a party that prides itself on being responsible for imperial affairs is actually disturbing one of the greatest crises in the history of the empire.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 11th - A Nationalist Party newspaper commented on the Baldwin case, calling it a political rebellion.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 11th - The newspapers this morning criticized Baldwin's decision not to participate in the Indian Round Table Conference again, with similar wording to last night's newspapers. Even the Conservative Party Morning Post admitted that this resolution has caused many unavoidable misunderstandings. After the end of the London Round Table Conference, the British government proposed sending several committees and experts to India to conduct an investigation, as the first step to holding another conference. Before long, the government changed its plan and decided to hold the Round Table Conference again in India without the condition of conducting prior investigations. The Conservative Party did not agree with this proposal.</p>
<h3>Hamaguchi Reassumes Premiership</h3>

Prime Minister Hamaguchi was supported by Koizumi and others to attend. The hall applauded warmly to welcome him. The Prime Minister seemed slightly haggard compared to yesterday. Speaker Tokugawa asked the Prime Minister to take the podium. The Prime Minister first stated that he was deeply grateful for the solemn condolence of the House on January 22. Secondly, he said that although he had encountered an unexpected disaster, he regretted that he had not been able to discuss national affairs for several months while serving as Prime Minister at a time when there were many national affairs. His health has gradually recovered, so he has lifted the position of acting by Shidehara and has been personally in charge of state affairs again since the first day of yesterday. His attitude was very solemn. He then rested in a comfortable chair in the Prime Minister's seat and then left the hall.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - At the House of Representatives Budget Committee today afternoon, when Wakamiya (Seiyukai) was raising questions about unemployment relief, Prime Minister Hamaguchi was supported by Secretary Nakajima to enter the hall, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense.

<h3>Taiwan People's Party Suddenly Forced to Dissolve</h3>
<p>Under the Brutal Power of the Japanese</p>
<p>All Party Members Arrested</p>
<p>Tokyo Special Dispatch - The Taiwan People's Party was forced to dissolve by the Japanese authorities in June 1925. In July of the same year, it continued to organize a central organization called the Taiwan People's Party, which recruited intellectuals from all over the island. The number of members reached 160. In the past four or five years, the party's struggle history in Taiwan has been full of various kinds of pain, which cannot be compared to the experiences of political groups in other colonies. The current leaders are Chen Qichang (Chairman) and Jiang Weishui (Minister of Finance), all of whom are students who have studied in Japan and have new ideas. During the indigenous people's riot in Taiwan last year, the party defended the indigenous people, advocated justice, and exposed the inhumane massacre policy of the Japanese soldiers against the indigenous people. As a result, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people all over the island was greatly aroused, and there was a sense of imminent explosion. Recently, the party held its fifth National Congress in Taipei City. The Police Affairs Bureau of the Governor-General's Office took the opportunity to arrest all its leaders and forced the dissolution of the party, closed party branches in various places, and confiscated its documents and property. The people all over the island were very angry, but under the brutal power of the Japanese, they could not resist. Anyone who had a slight anti-Japanese thought was arrested and imprisoned, and almost no one was spared. As for the internal situation of the Taiwanese people, Japanese officials strictly prohibited external propaganda. Therefore, Taiwan is no different from a secret country where Japanese people have extreme freedom, tyranny, and freedom to massacre. (World)</p>

<p>▲Kokumin, Geneva, 10th - Although the location of next year's International Disarmament Conference still needs to be finalized by the League of Nations Administrative Council in May, it is generally expected that Geneva will be selected without a doubt.

<h3>British House of Commons Passes Army Budget Number Bill</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - Today, the House of Commons passed the Army Budget Number Bill, which is for 148,800 people, a decrease of 100 people compared to the previous year. However, those serving in India are not included. The Independent Labour Party proposed an amendment to greatly reduce the number, but it was rejected by 216 votes to 19. The original bill was then passed. Army Minister Shaw stated that the army's expenses totaled £39,930,000, a net reduction of £570,000 compared to last year. The government intends to maintain all current forces. He did not want to make comparisons with other countries, but asked those who pay attention to this matter to read the situation disclosed in the League of Nations Armaments Yearbook. He believed that the UK's large-scale disarmament has not been imitated by other countries. He did not want to persuade the government to make repeated unilateral disarmament, but hoped to establish an international agreement so that all countries can get rid of the heavy burden they are currently bearing. However, at present, it is impossible to consider further reductions in the British army.</p>

<h3>Beining and Shenhai Railways Implement Inter-Railway Freight Cars Between Shenyang and Yingkou</h3>
<p>▲Improve Freight Efficiency and Eliminate Backlog</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence - In order to improve the freight efficiency between Shenyang and Yingkou on the Beining Railway and the Shenhai Railway Company and to eliminate the backlog of goods, the two railways have negotiated temporary measures for inter-railway freight cars between Shenyang and Yingkou, which will be implemented starting on March 10. The measures are as follows: (Article 1) In order to improve the freight efficiency between Shenyang and Yingkou on the two railways and eliminate the backlog of goods, special freight cars will be negotiated by the two railways for the exclusive transportation of full-car goods from major stations on the Shenhai to Yingkou Station on the Beining Railway. (Article 2) Five groups of special vehicles will be compiled and circulated daily according to A, B, C, D, and E. Each group will be limited to 20 vehicles, with the Shenhai providing 12 30-ton vehicles and the Beining providing 8 30-ton vehicles. When the Beining distributes them, it must maintain the originally ordered number of vehicles under any circumstances. When the Shenhai exports them, it must not reduce them by half unless there are unavoidable circumstances. (Article 3) On both sides of this special freight car, wooden signs will be nailed by each railway, with the words "Shen-Ying Special Car Group A, B, C, D, E" written on them for identification and reference. (Article 4) Special vehicles are exclusively loaded with full-car goods jointly transported to Yingkou. For those sent to other stations on the Beining Railway, the Beining Railway will still do its best to supply vehicles every day, with a limit of at least 20 to 30 vehicles, which will be distributed with the 235th service. (Article 5) The hanging and delivery of inter-railway cars between Shenyang and Liaoning General Station shall be arranged with the 213th service for empty cars and the 238th service for heavy cars. (Article 6) The special vehicles are divided into five groups, A, B, C, D, and E, and should be circulated in order. The order shall not be disrupted unless it is unavoidable. The method is as follows: (A) The Beining distributes empty cars, and the Shenhai distributes them as appropriate. After each station is fully loaded, they will be hung to Shenyang and transferred to the Beining for hanging to Yingkou. After unloading, they will be returned to the Shenhai. (B) Groups C, D, and E are deduced in order. (Article 7) The following stations are tentatively designated for handling special vehicles: Beining, Shenhai, Shanchengzhen, Meihekou, Hailong, Chaoyangzhen, Dongfeng, and Xi'an. (Article 8) This method will be implemented from March 10 until the full-car goods sent to Yingkou are insufficient for one train at a station, and the sending of vehicles will be abolished.

<h3>Details of the Mutiny of Troops Stationed in Luan</h3>
<p>▲Total Losses in the County Reach Five Million</p>
<p>▲Sun's Troops in Gaoping Also Mutiny</p>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan reports that the Fifth Division under Yang Xiaoou, of the Second Army of the Jin Army, stationed in Jincheng, recently underwent disbandment. From February 23rd to 25th, the entire division moved to Luan. The 13th and 14th Regiments of the division were stationed in the shops along the east and west streets of the city, while the 15th Regiment was stationed in the western suburbs and Fangcun area. The divisional headquarters was located in the Tianshunchang Salt Shop on Weiqian Street. On the night of the 26th, the entire division, along with the 16th Regiment of the Sixth Division, suddenly mutinied. Gunfire and cannon fire roared until 8 AM the following morning. The cause of the mutiny was reportedly due to the fact that the soldiers had not been paid for four months. During this disbandment, the Fifth Division had the largest number of surplus personnel, including the Fifth Division Commander Wang Bi, who was also on the surplus list. Therefore, the mutiny was launched by this unit. When the mutiny began, the troops stationed in the city first disarmed the baggage, engineering, and other battalions of the Second Army. They also monitored various units of the Fourth Division and the cavalry company within the city, besieging the military headquarters several times throughout the night, but failed to break through. The 15th Regiment, stationed outside the city, feared that the 11th and 12th Regiments of the Fourth Division, stationed in the Dayingpan outside the north gate and in the villages of Guancunzhen and Lujiazhuang, would come to their rescue. Therefore, they secretly traveled to seize the weapons of these two regiments. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting until the evening of the following day. The siege of Dayingpan lasted for a day without success. The 12th Regiment, stationed in Guancun, due to a shortage of ammunition after a day of fighting with the 15th Regiment, retreated to Beidanshan, on the eastern edge of the village, on the evening of that day. One battalion of the 11th Regiment, stationed in Lujiazhuang, retreated to Qiangcheng Village in Lucheng County. When the troops from these two villages retreated, the 15th Regiment immediately advanced and carried away all their clothes, military provisions, and seized more than two hundred firearms from one battalion of the 11th Regiment. Both sides suffered eighty to ninety deaths. From the night of the 26th to the 28th, pedestrian traffic in the city of Luan was cut off, and the mutinous soldiers carried out large-scale looting. The worst-hit area was the west street, where no merchant or civilian household was spared. The second worst-hit area was the north street, where about two-thirds of the households were affected. Fifteen or sixteen villages were looted. The total losses in the county are estimated to be over five million yuan. The Chamber of Commerce is now sounding gongs, ordering the victims to report their losses in detail. The northwest gates of the city are occupied by the Fifth Division, while the southeast gates are guarded by the Fourth Division. On the evening of the 28th, Zhou Shilian, the former commander of the 17th Army, went by car to mediate, promising to pay all four months of arrears first. Soldiers who wish to continue serving will be paid, while those who do not will be sent back to their hometowns. The situation has now eased from a state of martial law, and there are fewer reports of looting. Yang Xiaoou, along with Liu Fengbin, the commander of the Sixth Division, escaped by rope from the city walls on the morning of the 27th during the fighting. Since Yang's departure, Zhou Sicheng, the commander of the Fourth Division, has been responsible for the security of Luan.</p>
<p>A friend from Gaoping who came to the province said that in the late last month, Sun Dianying's troops were stationed in Fengzhuang Village, two miles from the city. Two companies mutinied and looted five families, including the Zhu family in Chixiang Village, and burned Zhu Laowu, a wealthy household in the village, with candles, forcing him to hand over his property. Zhu died the next day due to his serious injuries. The mutinous soldiers then fled to Gouyao Village, a small village of about twenty households, which was completely looted, with no one spared. When Sun Dianying heard about this, he immediately sent troops to pursue and suppress them. The outcome is still unknown. At the moment, the people in all the villages and towns in the county are in a state of panic. (March 8th)</p>
<h3>Liang Huiwu, Comprador of Jardine Matheson in Tianjin, Kidnapped</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin reports that Jardine Matheson, a British merchant firm, conducts tens of millions of yuan worth of trade in Tianjin every year. Its business is very developed, divided into import, export, shipping, and metals departments. Each department has its own Chinese comprador. Chen Zhuling, who was kidnapped last year, was also a comprador of the firm, in charge of the export section. Liang Huiwu, who succeeded his father, Liang Yanqing, as the firm's comprador, was recommended by his father when he became old. The Liang family, father and son, have served as the firm's compradors for more than sixty years, so they are wealthy and are among the leading Cantonese merchants in Tianjin. Huiwu is fifty-three years old, has four brothers, and is the second child. His second younger brother is at Nankai School. He has a wife and five children. His father, Yanqing, is now eighty years old. Huiwu goes to the firm every morning at 10 AM to handle business, returns home at 12 PM for lunch, goes to the firm at 2 PM, and returns home at 4 PM. He travels to and from the firm in his own rickshaw. The firm is located on Zhongjie Street in the British Concession, and his home is located at No. 129 Guangdong Road in the British Concession, which is no more than a mile away. The day before yesterday (the 5th), when he was returning home at 4:30 PM, his rickshaw was turning from Gordon Road to Guangdong Road, and just as he was about to proceed east to west, a car suddenly turned from the intersection of Gordon Road from south to east, causing Liang's rickshaw to be unable to move forward. At the same time, two people with handguns rushed to Liang's rickshaw and forced him to get out of the car. Liang was extremely frightened at the sight and threw himself forward onto the rickshaw puller. The rickshaw puller, Bao Guangping, was knocked to the ground by Liang. The bandits fired two shots into the ground and dragged Liang into the car next to them, speeding away. Chinese police officers who arrived after hearing the gunshots saw that Liang had been kidnapped, but the rickshaw puller was still lying on the ground with his head in his hands, afraid to look up. The police immediately reported to the Municipal Council by telephone and began searching, but there was no information for a while. The rickshaw puller was then taken to the police station for questioning. According to his statement, he did not know how Liang was kidnapped in his shock. The Chinese police also reported that the car's license plate number was 1165, and after investigation, it was found that the number was the same as the car used by the owner of the Mei Zuishi foreign firm. However, on the afternoon of the incident, the owner of Mei Zuishi's car did not leave the house, so it is suspected that the bandits forged the number. After the incident, the British Municipal Council telegraphed the various concessions,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>+and the municipal authorities to assist in the arrest of the bandits. When Zhang Xueming, the director of the Public Security Bureau, heard the news, he also went to Liang's home to visit. According to Liang's family, they had not recently received any threatening letters from bandits. Yesterday, for the sake of security, Liang's home kept the gate tightly closed and hired a Chinese police officer to protect the outside. Friends and relatives came to express their condolences all day long. Liang's father, Yanqing, fainted upon hearing the news, and his family was extremely worried, not eating or drinking day and night. There has been no outward expression, but the authorities have offered a reward and are determined to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice. (March 6th)</p>
<h3>Peiping Burns Hongxian Paper Money</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Peiping reports that when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor in the third year of the Republic, Liang Shiyi planned to issue paper money to meet the huge financial needs. Six hundred million yuan of Yuan's portrait banknotes were ordered to be printed from the American Bank Note Company. The paper and printing costs were several million yuan. The plan was to transport it back to China and have the Bank of China issue it for non-cash use. While being shipped across the Pacific Ocean from the United States, four boxes, totaling 35 million yuan, were lost at sea near Kobe, Japan, due to a shipping mishap. At that time, fearing that the money would be retrieved and put into circulation, the remaining 565 million yuan that were transported back to China were never issued. Over the years, they have been stored in the Bank of China and the old Ministry of Revenue treasury. Recently, the General Management Office of the Bank of China considered this money to be waste paper. Since there are more than 1,600 boxes of this money stored in the Bank of China's warehouse in Peiping, occupying too much warehouse space, it specifically requested the Ministry of Finance to allow its destruction. After the Ministry of Finance approved the request, it also ordered Zhou Dalai, a staff member of the Ministry's Monetary Affairs Department, and Jing Youyan, a special commissioner of finance for Hebei, to jointly supervise the destruction. After receiving the order, the agency, due to the enormous amount of money, immediately sent a letter to the Peiping Printing Bureau (i.e., the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance) to borrow a furnace for burning banknotes, scheduled to begin burning on the 9th of this month. The order from the Ministry of Finance to the special commissioner of Hebei is recorded below: "According to a letter from the General Management Office of the Bank of China, the former Ministry of Finance in Beijing ordered 600 million yuan of Yuan's portrait banknotes from the American Bank Note Company in March of the third year of the Republic. However, a batch of 35 million yuan was lost at sea during transport to China, and has not been fully recovered, resulting in its never being issued. It has been stored separately in the Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance treasury in Peiping. Repeated requests have been made to the former Ministry of Finance to destroy it. Since this money is equivalent to waste paper, and there are more than 1,200 boxes stored in the Bank of China's warehouse in Peiping, occupying too much warehouse space, it is proposed to destroy it immediately to relieve the storage pressure. Based on this, in addition to issuing an order for approval and issuing separate orders, it is urgently ordered that the aforementioned official immediately go to jointly supervise the destruction and report the results. Also, submit two copies of the banknote samples to the ministry for reference."</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Holds Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers of the Third Army</h3>
<p>▲Also Commemorates Fallen Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou reports that Wang Jun, the commander of the Seventh Division, recently initiated a memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the Third Army who died during the suppression of the rebellion. It is scheduled to be held today (the 10th). At the same time, it will also commemorate the fallen soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who died during the suppression of the rebellion. The venue is the military club on the old town hall street. Preparations were completed in advance. This morning at 10:00, Wang Jun led personnel from the Jinpu Garrison Command and the Seventh Division to the venue. Zhao Erjie and Chen Xianwu from the Twelfth Division, Yang Zhiqu and Zhang Zhuo from the Tenth Division, and others arrived in Xuzhou to participate. All the agencies and organizations in Xuzhou participated, totaling more than 10,000 people. The memorial altar was set up with memorial tablets for the fallen soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who died during the suppression of the rebellion, and the fallen soldiers of the Third Army who died during the suppression of the rebellion, as well as name lists of the fallen soldiers of the Seventh, Tenth, and Twelfth Divisions. Offerings were placed in front of the altar. First, public sacrifices were made by various agencies, with Wang Jun presiding and various representatives assisting. Then, public sacrifices were made by the Third Army, still presided over by Wang Jun, with various military officers assisting. After the public sacrifices, individual sacrifices were made in succession. In the morning, sacrifices were made by local organizations, and in the afternoon, sacrifices were made by the 37th, 38th, 41st, and 42nd Regiments of the Seventh Division, as well as the directly subordinate units, in separate shifts. Plain carriages and white horses were used to express deep sorrow. Various departments of the National Government and military authorities of various provinces sent elegiac couplets and eulogies. In front of the altar was an elegiac couplet from Wang Jun: "Creating a new country, vowing to sweep away the primary evil and great traitor, sacrificing lives without hesitation, heroically and vigorously completing a great feat; remembering comrades-in-arms, unforgettable great achievements and illustrious merits, offering sacrifices and libations, mournfully and sadly mourning the heroic souls." The entire port lowered its flags to half-mast today and suspended entertainment for one day to express mourning. (March 10th)</p>
<h3>The Reported Resolved Content of the Ning-Han-Jinan Cases According to the Daily News</h3>
<p>The World News Agency reports that, according to reports, Foreign Minister Wang and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu met at the official residence for a long time on the afternoon of the 4th. After the meeting, Shigemitsu told people that there were no more problems with the Ning-Han-Jinan cases and that payment should be made soon. There is no need for the exchange of documents. It seems that the compensation issue for the Ning-Han-Jinan cases was completely resolved at the meeting on the 4th. After Minister Wang and Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa reached an agreement on the general framework for the resolution of the case, about a year and a half has passed, and the remaining compensation issues have also reached a final resolution. It seems that the documents regarding the amount of compensation have already been exchanged. The main points are: (1) Ning case: The Japanese side initially claimed 3.43 million yuan, while the Chinese side claimed 500,000 yuan. The final result was 750,000 yuan, taking into account the current gold and silver market, etc. (2) Han case: The Japanese side claimed 700,000 yuan, while the Chinese side claimed 160,000 yuan. The final result was 300,000 yuan. (3) Jinan case: In the above general agreement, it was originally agreed that losses would be offset. Although a nominal loss investigation committee was appointed, there was no need for an actual investigation. The Japanese side donated 45,000 yuan to Cai Gongshi's widow to resolve everything. (4) Payment method: The compensation for the above three cases will be paid in monthly installments starting from March. However, the amount and term will be determined according to the accounting status of the Audit Yuan. As noted above, part of the unpleasant pending cases between China and Japan have been resolved. The Su Zhenxiang case and other cases will be reopened when the opportunity arises. In addition, the Namba assassination case, the Dagu Fort incident, and small pending cases before the establishment of the National Government have been resolved with both sides agreeing not to pursue them. At the same time, all emotions are abandoned. Both sides will proceed with legal negotiations completely as if starting with a clean slate.</p>

<p>Conflict Arising from Misunderstanding Between Militia and Police</p>
<p>The fourth branch of the township police station in Chonggu Town, the ninth district of the county, sent police to Jia Dian the day before yesterday to arrest gamblers. On their way back to the town, they encountered a patrolman from the defense corps of the district. Due to a misunderstanding of the password and the inability to recognize each other in the dark, shots were fired into the air. One patrolman from the police station and two gamblers were captured by the defense corps. The next day, the police station believed that the defense corps had overstepped its authority, while the defense corps believed that the patrolmen from the police station intentionally provoked the situation. Both sides have reported to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Revisions to the Merit-Based Salary Increase Method</p>
<p>The county education bureau had previously formulated a method for granting merit-based salary increases to elementary school teachers and staff, which was submitted to the education department for approval. Later, a review committee was organized to review the years of service of each teacher and staff member and to establish detailed implementation rules, which were submitted to the education department for instructions in order to implement the method. The education department instructed that the method only considered years of service and did not focus on merit, which was considered excessive, and ordered revisions. Yang Shizeng, the director of the county education bureau, convened a temporary county education administration meeting on the 8th to make revisions. Repairs to the Telephone Lines in the City and Countryside</p>
<p>The telephone lines in the city and countryside of this county were previously downed by heavy snow. The telephone company ordered engineers to repair them. However, due to the extensive damage, repairs could not be completed immediately. Therefore, the telephone lines to the remote towns have been down for almost a month. Repairs were finally completed the day before yesterday, and telephone service has resumed as normal.</p>

<p>Regulations on the Limits of Land Rent Interest Rates</p>
<p>The collection of land rent in this county has traditionally been divided into three periods starting from the opening of the granary, each lasting half a month. In addition to tenants enjoying priority rights for paying within the first period, late payments are subject to interest and additional fees. If payment is delayed until the spring, not only is interest calculated on a progressive basis, but the rent price is also increased several times, and the initial payments are even deducted, resulting in the confiscation of the spring harvest. The current party and government discussion group believes that this kind of malpractice is equivalent to exploitation, so it specifically proposed to ban it. The county council has also stipulated that the maximum rent interest rate shall not exceed two percent to show compassion. A notice was issued yesterday to comply with this.</p>

<p>Merger of the Municipal Engineering Office</p>
<p>Mao Feng, the newly appointed director of the construction bureau, has made many reforms to the bureau's facilities since taking over on the 7th of this month. Most of the old staff have resigned, so the handling of affairs is insufficient. His main mission in coming to Wuxi this time is to complete the Wuxi-Changzhou and Wuxi-Yixing provincial road projects. Zhou Jingzi has been appointed as the director of the two-road highway office to take full responsibility. Also, the Municipal Engineering Office is too far from the bureau, making it inconvenient to handle affairs. It is proposed to merge the two offices into one, so that all matters can be handled at any time, avoiding the delay of traveling back and forth. The proposed measures are: (1) The original buildings of the Municipal Engineering Office will be used as storage for municipal engineering equipment and as staff dormitories. (2) An inventory of all instruments and other items of the Municipal Engineering Office will be compiled and submitted to the Municipal Property Management Committee for filing. The above two points were submitted to the 81st County Council meeting for discussion and approved yesterday and will be implemented immediately.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Military Training Absences Must Be Made Up</h3>
<p>The National Sun Yat-sen University previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Education asking whether students who had been granted long-term exemptions from military training due to illness should be required to make up the training in the future. The Ministry of Education instructed that since military education is stipulated as a required course, all students should be required to take it. A small number of students who require long-term exemptions from military training due to illness should make up the training after they recover until they have satisfied the course requirements for graduation. However, if the time remaining until graduation is less than two years, and they are unable to complete their military education, a flexible approach may be allowed. All students who have more than two years remaining in school may not use physical weakness as an excuse to avoid completing the required military education credits.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the school also submitted a request regarding whether physical education athletes, former members of the military band, and graduates of military schools should be treated the same as students who are granted exemptions from military training due to illness. The Ministry of Education instructed that physical education and military band are not the same as military training. Students who are physical education athletes and former members of the military band at the school should still be required to make up the military training credits. As for whether graduates of military schools can be given some leniency, the Ministry of Education replied with a letter approved by the Director-General of Training stating that the purpose of military education is not only to cultivate students' knowledge and skills as soldiers, but also to train their bodies and minds, and to cultivate their concepts of discipline, obedience, responsibility, and hard work. Therefore, graduates of military schools should still be required to make up the training in order to cultivate their military virtues and to serve as models for the entire class. Therefore, these students should also be required to make up the training.</p>

The province's Class A agricultural and commercial schools may be called senior high school agricultural or commercial departments, or vocational schools in agricultural or commercial departments, if their curriculum is indeed equivalent to that of senior high school. Class B vocational schools should be called vocational supplementary schools. Subsequently, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education submitted a request for instructions on the names of vocational schools equivalent to junior high school level. The Ministry of Education instructed that vocational schools that are indeed equivalent to senior high school level may be called senior vocational schools, and vocational schools that are equivalent to junior high school level should be called junior vocational schools. The province's existing Class B vocational schools, which admit graduates of higher primary schools, are equivalent to junior high school level and should be called junior vocational schools.

Today is a good day to celebrate the school, but it coincides with the National Memorial Service for the Fallen Soldiers in the Anti-Rebellion Campaign, so banquets and entertainment have been suspended. Therefore, the school first held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers in the anti-rebellion campaign before holding the tenth anniversary celebration ceremony, and the recreational performances, singing and dancing, and Peking opera were changed to be performed tomorrow afternoon. Xue Peili, the school doctor, had served for many years and worked diligently. He passed away a few days ago, and his funeral is today, so we should also mourn him. Next, Qian Xinzhi gave a speech, saying that he had just been appointed and would soon go to France. He had always worked in the financial industry and was not an expert in diplomacy. However, he believed that diplomacy should not focus on formalities and means, but should focus on efforts to communicate culture and economic cooperation. The cultural and economic relations between China and France have always been good and have a considerable foundation, so he dared to go. Next, Zhu Yan, the former president of the school, gave a speech, saying that he had served as the president of the school five years ago and gave a brief account of the establishment of the school, expressing his gratitude to the Chinese and French founders of the school.

<h3>(I) China and the League Evenly Matched in Autumn Brilliance (Women's)</h3>
<p>｜Star Player Fouled Out, Diminishing the Team's Luster｜</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Basketball Team, comprised entirely of representatives from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, was selected for their long training and excellent skills. During their debut performance last night, they inevitably felt nervous, which detracted from their performance. As their form gradually improved and victory seemed within reach, their key defenders, Wang Lanzhuang and Shu Yuxi, were both fouled out. Furthermore, Long Jingxiong's leg injury impaired her natural movements. The League capitalized on this, resulting in a 26-26 tie. The first to score for their respective teams were M. Sasso for the League, and Yang Ren for China, with a casual shot into the basket. Xi Jun drove straight through the center, successfully scoring. The League's interior was strong, allowing their forwards to advance freely, but their shooting was inaccurate, with nine out of ten shots missing. Soon after, Shao Jinying stood out from the crowd and scored inside the basket. In the first quarter, China led with six points to the League's three. The League's main player, Johnson, switched from defense to offense, immediately strengthening their force. In a flash, the difference narrowed, with the score briefly at 5-6 and 7-8. China worked hard and won the first half 13-9. In the second half, Xi Jun opened the scoring, followed by Shao Jinying. Johnson of the League also showed no weakness. However, in general, China's performance was more brilliant than before, turning the score to 22-13. The League then called a time-out. Soon after, the League began to improve, and with Wang Lanzhuang and Shu Yuxi out of the game, and Long Jingxiong injured, they launched a major offensive, tying the score at 14. Then, Shao Jinying and Johnson each scored a basket, ending the game at 26-26, with the autumn colors evenly divided.</p>

<h3>(II) America Crushes England with a Huge Difference (Women's)</h3>
<p>｜Erwin Scores 39 Points Alone｜</p>
<p>America charged into the enemy's formation, but missed several shots. England suddenly counter-attacked, scoring a long shot as if divinely assisted, and soon after, added a point from a free throw. America's Erwin then began to demonstrate her sharpshooting skills, scoring continuously. With the help of the center, she was able to do as she pleased, scoring a total of 39 points, breaking the 34-point record of Classwhitt of the previous tournament. After the score reached 11-3, America, confident of victory, continued to substitute reserve players for practice. In the last four minutes, the regular players returned to secure the final victory. England's best performance was in the third quarter of the four quarters. In the first half, America scored 34 points, while England scored 5 points. In the end, America won decisively with a score of 54-19.</p>

<h3>(III) China Crushes the Jewish Team with Ease (Men's)</h3>
<p>｜Jewish Team Scores Zero in the Second Half｜</p>
<p>The Chinese team achieved a great victory in their debut, crushing the Jewish team with ease. All the team members took turns playing, and almost all of them scored. First, Chen Xianglong, Liang Guoquan, Wei Qinghai, Lu Zhongen, and Kong Guangyi were sent into battle, causing a great uproar in the enemy's camp. The ball entered the basket like a string of pearls. Within five minutes, they scored a total of 16 points. When the score reached 36 points, the enemy finally scored one point from a free throw. Subsequently, China frequently made substitutions, and the players were unfamiliar with each other, so the Jewish team took the opportunity to score some points in the first half. At halftime, China had 42 points and the Jewish team had 9 points. In the second half, the Jewish team's spirit remained strong, but their skills deteriorated. During the 20 minutes, the Chinese athletes took turns scoring, while the Jewish team could not advance an inch. As a result, China won by a large margin of 87-9 against the Jewish team.</p>

In addition to the text, there are also more than one hundred kinds of charts to show readers the scientific methods of kicking the ball and various postures. This is a must-read book for those who practice football and basketball. The book is nearing completion of printing and will be published soon.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Reported on the Progress of the People's Congress Election Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Drafting a Provisional Constitution is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>▲Education Association and Farmers' Association Will Be Established</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, the election supervisor of the Shanghai People's Congress, received reporters at the reception room of the Fenglinqiao Diplomatic Building at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the progress of the people's election and expressed the hope that the press would provide guidance and publicity.</p>
<p>▲Preparation Process Zhang said, "Since I took office as the election supervisor of Shanghai, I have established an office and started working in two days. All organizations are in accordance with the regulations set by the central government, and organizational laws and detailed rules for handling affairs have been formulated and promulgated for implementation. As for the staff, they are all temporarily dispatched by the municipal government and various bureaus. The municipal party headquarters has also appointed many people to carry out the work together. Now, after deliberation by the office meeting, the Election Law of the National Assembly promulgated by the central government and the Election Implementation Law that are related to Shanghai have been compiled into a book called "Shanghai Election Laws and Regulations" and "Election Guidelines," which are distributed to all circles for reference."</p>
<p>▲Group Registration The office will issue registration books and forms starting from the next day, and notify various groups to claim them. In recent days, groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various public and private universities have actively claimed the registration books and forms. Only the Lawyers Association, because they perform their duties mostly in the provinces and regions, will join the election in the provinces and regions and have not come to claim them.</p>
<p>▲Guidance Organization Regarding the trade unions, there are already more than 20 that have been reorganized and established under the guidance of the municipal party headquarters, and the rest are also being guided for organization. The Education Association, Farmers' Association, etc. have also begun to organize, and it is expected that they will be established in a short period of time. Various groups will be formally recognized by this office after obtaining certification from the party and government organs.</p>
<p>▲Review and Announcement After this office receives the various registers, they will be submitted for review. After the review is completed, the list of this city must be compiled and announced on a regular basis. The most difficult part of the announcement procedure is currently planned to be published in addition to the list, or to print the list, or to publish advertisements, and I hope that the press will assist. In addition, please publish as much as possible on the publicity of the people's congress text. I remember that when Premier Min XIII arrived in Shanghai, he received the press at his residence on Molier Road and said that the convening of the National Assembly must be the responsibility of the press for a large amount of publicity, and today is the time.</p>
<p>Provisional Constitution Zhang also said that in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang Special Office was established in Guangzhou. In July, the Premier gave a speech on the Five-Power Constitution, and its essential words were, "The Constitution in politics is a large machine that dominates personnel, and it is also a large machine that harmonizes freedom and dictatorship." After repeatedly explaining the analysis in detail, the Premier knew from the results of studying ancient and modern history at home and abroad that without implementing the Five-Power Constitution, the freedom of the people would be deprived of protection, and the dictatorship of the authorities could not be prevented. Therefore, it is stipulated that military law shall be applied during the military and political periods, and a provisional constitution shall be formulated during the political tutelage and constitutional periods. It can be seen that drafting a provisional constitution in today's National Assembly is the most important mission, and it is a matter of life and death for our Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Construction in the City Center</h3>
<p>▲All Main Roads Can Be Completed Next Month</p>
<p>▲Municipal Government Housing Begins Construction</p>
<p>Regarding the construction plan in the city center, Mayor Zhang told our reporter yesterday that the municipal government plans to build municipal government houses in the city center, estimated to cost 500,000 yuan, and decided to open bidding next month, start construction in May, hold the groundbreaking ceremony on July 7, and complete all of them in the fall of next year and begin to move in for office work. The main roads in the city center can be completed next month. It was also decided to open up 1,000 mu of land close to the transportation center on the west side of the New Municipal Government Sanmin Road East, Xiangyin Road South, and Songhu Road North at the lowest price for people to invest in, so that commerce will gradually prosper. People from all walks of life may not know much about the municipal government's plans for construction in the city center, so it was decided to hold a tree planting ceremony in the city center tomorrow (today) at 2:00 PM, so that all walks of life can witness the progress of construction in the city center.</p>
<h3>New Shanghai County Administration</h3>
<p>▲Land Will Be Enclosed</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Shanghai County relocation, after the last county government meeting decided on the location, all expenses were also decided to be sold to the municipal government, and the price was calculated to be 80,000 yuan for the land and houses. All relocation procedures and the design plan of the new county administration were ordered by the county government yesterday to be handled as soon as possible by Wu Wenhua, the director of the County Construction Bureau, and the design plan should be drafted and submitted to the county for review and approval for implementation. As for the land enclosed for the new county administration, it was previously set at 200 mu, but it is heard that after all county-level agencies such as the party headquarters are relocated to the south of the Hu-Min Road, this number may still be insufficient. Therefore, it is heard that dozens more mu will be enclosed in the future.</p>

The remaining services will still run between Shanghai and Paotaiwan. The timetables for the main Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines will also be scheduled and are expected to be changed from April 1st. Internally, two express trains between Shanghai and Nanjing, and a shuttle service and special express train for the Shanghai-Zhenjiang area will be added.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Still Unable to Test Flight</h3>
<p>▲Testing Aircraft Components Lately</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Manchuria route of the Sino-German Eurasia Aviation Company was still unable to conduct a test flight yesterday. Of the four Junkers aircraft that have arrived, two have been assembled at Hongqiao Airport. The company is currently testing the aircraft components. According to sources within the company, the aircraft must be tested in the air in Shanghai for at least seven hours before a long-distance test flight can be made. Furthermore, since the new aircraft cannot be tested for seven hours in one flight, it must be divided into several days, first testing the flight in Shanghai, and then testing the flights to Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, Duolun, and all the way to Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Director Xie Qi of the Consolidated Tax Bureau Corrects the Tone of Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the Japanese-language Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun recently published an editorial stating that the consolidated tobacco tax treats cigars and cigarettes produced by both Chinese and foreign factories equally. This move will severely impact the Chinese tobacco industry and allow foreign firms to monopolize the Chinese cigarette market. It also claimed that the consolidated cotton yarn tax treats both Chinese and foreign factories equally, which would implicitly grant Japanese yarn factories patent rights. A reporter from the National News Agency inquired about this matter with Xie Qi, Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. According to Xie, the content of the Japanese newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. Xie also cited statistics from previous years to prove that the consolidated tax is not harmful to Chinese industry. Since the consolidated tax was levied, in the year of the Republic of China 17, the tax paid by Chinese cigarette factories accounted for 43% of the total cigarette tax, while in the year of the Republic of China 19, it had increased to 56%. Xie also stated that the irregular taxes in China's past, such as likin, had a great impact on domestic businesses, while foreign merchants were not affected at all. Now that Chinese and foreign businesses are on an equal footing, the shackles of the past have been removed. Xie pointed out that the irresponsible attitude of the Japanese newspaper is due to some incautious foreigners who want to find ways to make China revert to the irregular tax collection of the past, putting Chinese industry and commerce in an unfavorable position so that their businesses can flourish.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Postpones Return to the North</h3>
<p>▲Constantly Occupied These Days</p>
<p>▲Pleading for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the North China Charity Association, has come to Shanghai to solicit donations for the Shaanxi disaster, deeply impressing the people of this city. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently hosted a special banquet inviting representatives from various trade associations and prominent figures from all walks of life to form over a hundred donation teams, each with a quota of 2,000 yuan. Active fundraising is currently underway. Yesterday, Zhu, accompanied by Zha Liangzhao and Shanghai merchant Wu Zhihao, visited the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Overseas Chinese Federation to meet with key officials. Shanghai financiers Qin Runqing, Xie Taofu, and Li Shoushan, among others, invited representatives from various trades to the Money Trade Association last night to view films of the Shaanxi disaster and invited Zhu Ziqiao to report on the disaster relief efforts in Shaanxi. Over a thousand people attended, and Qin Runqing presided over the meeting. After introducing Zhu to the guests, Zhu took the stage to report, stating that he had gone to Shaanxi for disaster relief due to the severity of the disaster and had filmed the situation to bring to Shanghai for screening to raise awareness. He stated that most of the dead in Shaanxi were not buried in coffins but were left in their homes, while the survivors were scattered and ate all the grass roots and tree bark. Although efforts were made to provide relief, the donations were limited. At this time of year, when the old harvest has run out and the new harvest is not yet in, a large sum of money is needed to continue the relief efforts. Subsequently, the film was screened, and the guests were moved by the scenes and were willing to ask their relatives and friends to donate so that the funds could be collected and entrusted to Zhu to take to Shaanxi for distribution. It is said that Zhu was originally scheduled to return to the north today, but due to unfinished business, his departure has been postponed for four or five days. The telegrams and letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Telegram to Chairman Chiang: Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, the Shaanxi disaster is severe, and relief is urgently needed. The Fourth Plenary Session previously resolved to issue 8 million yuan in public bonds for disaster relief in Shaanxi. Qinglan, in Shaanxi, sent a letter of appeal and received your reply, promising to instruct the Ministry of Finance to expedite the matter. Now, as the old harvest has run out and the new harvest is not yet in, the situation is critical. The living await life, the dead await burial, and the purchase and distribution of seeds and the construction of water conservancy projects require significant funds. Qinglan has come to Shanghai and has received enthusiastic support from people from all walks of life, establishing the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Shaanxi Disaster Relief. I will visit Nanjing soon to report on the disaster and plead for the people of Shaanxi. I earnestly request your strong support for the prompt allocation of the aforementioned public bonds to alleviate the urgent need. I pray without end. Zhu Qinglan respectfully bows, True.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to Minister Song: Respectfully addressed to Minister of Finance Song of the Nanjing National Government, the Shaanxi disaster is severe, and relief is urgently needed. The Central Government previously decided to issue 8 million yuan in public bonds for disaster relief. I earnestly implore you to consider the disaster victims and expedite the allocation to prolong lives. I pray without end. Zhu Qinglan respectfully bows, True.</p>
<p>▲Letter from President Yu: To the Presidium and all members of the Fundraising Association for Shaanxi Disaster Relief, I am deeply regretful for my inability to attend the conference due to official duties. The Shaanxi disaster is severe, and relief cannot be delayed. Winter relief has been missed, and spring relief is even more urgent. Now that you have made a call to action, you will surely be able to quickly raise significant funds to save these remnants. I dare to represent the millions of disaster victims in Shaanxi with bowed head to thank you. Because Mr. Sun Junlongji is returning to Shanghai, I have entrusted him with this letter to report on the situation.</p>
<p>▲Letter to President Yu: Addressed to President Yu of the Nanjing Control Yuan, I have just sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang and Minister Song, requesting the prompt issuance of Shaanxi disaster relief public bonds and planning to go to Beijing to appeal on behalf of the disaster victims. I hereby inform you in advance. Zhu Qinglan respectfully bows, True.</p>
<p>▲Letter to Various Organizations: The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association sent letters to the Guangzhao Association and the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, the Shaanxi disaster is of unprecedented severity. Qinglan, despite his limited abilities, strove to raise relief funds last year and personally distributed them three times. Seeing the situation firsthand, I felt even more that a cup of water cannot put out a burning cartload of firewood. Without raising significant funds, it is difficult to speak of thorough relief. Therefore, I resolutely came to Shanghai to plead for the eight million disaster victims in Shaanxi and have been fortunate to receive enthusiastic support from concerned individuals in Shanghai, establishing the Shanghai Temporary Emergency Relief Association for Shaanxi Disaster Relief and actively soliciting donations from all sectors, with excellent results. However, the disaster area in Shaanxi is too vast, and there are too many disaster victims. With spring plowing awaiting relief, the situation is extremely urgent. We have long admired your association as a well-known organization in Shanghai with significant strength and many benevolent and charitable individuals. Therefore, we venture to write this letter, attaching four donation booklets, and earnestly request your association to take the lead in promoting and generously donating, and to solicit donations on our behalf, so that the disaster victims in Shaanxi who have died can be properly buried, and the dying remnants can receive relief. We will be endlessly grateful for your benevolence, and the executives of your association will receive immeasurable blessings. We await your command with anticipation."</p>
<h3>Xinchang Salvage Continues Hong Kong Service for China Merchants</h3>
<p>▲Eight Crew Members Arrive in Shanghai: After the Xinchang incident, eight crew members, including the head boatswain who went to Shangsijiao Mountain, escaped by fishing boat to Ningbo. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the New Jiangtian Wheel of our company and reported to the union and the head office to reissue their lost papers and request subsidies.</p>
<p>▲Subsidies Have Been Issued: The shipwrecked sailors who were rescued and returned to Shanghai had their names checked by the China Merchants Bureau, which arranged for their accommodation. Regarding the loss of baggage and belongings of each person, due to the act of God and unexpected events, General Manager Li, in consideration of the difficulties of each person, specially provided each person with a subsidy of 60 yuan, following the example of the New Ji Wheel, to compensate for the loss of items. The subsidies were issued in the bureau yesterday afternoon, with Qian Shuming from the Shipping Department supervising the payment. Senior crew members, such as the chief and second officers, and telegraph operators, have not yet been paid.</p>
<p>▲Salvage Method Agreed Upon: Yesterday, the Shipping Department and representatives of the Japanese Salvage Company in Shanghai agreed that the Salvage Company would first send a technician, workers, and a diver to Sijiao Mountain to survey the seabed and agreed to conduct the survey within three days, at a cost of 1,500 taels of silver. After the survey, the company will undertake the salvage after fifteen days. Section Chief Huang has obtained the approval of General Manager Li and sent a letter to the Salvage Company yesterday requesting them to proceed accordingly. The location of the shipwreck is at 122 degrees 22 minutes east longitude and 30 degrees 46 minutes north latitude, at a place called Sijiao Mountain. The ship's hull has already sunk into the sea.</p>
<p>Resumption of Shanghai-Hong Kong Service Discussed: The China Merchants Bureau's ship to Hong Kong was formerly the New China Wheel. After the New China incident, the Xinchang was overhauled, and the machinery and passenger compartments were renovated to be used in place of the former. Hong Kong authorities then permitted the ship to sail. Now that the Xinchang has had an accident, the entire bureau has no ship that can go to Hong Kong. General Manager Li believed that the Hong Kong business was significant and that the regular schedule should not be suspended due to the Xinchang incident. It was decided to charter a ship to resume the service. After discussing the matter for several days, an agreement has been reached with Zhao Juntai of Yuan'an Company to charter the Yuan'an Wheel to replace the Xinchang.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Great Premier</h3>
<p>The Premier is the founding father of the Republic of China, the guide of the National Revolution, and the leader of the Chinese Nationalist Party. His greatness is known and admired by all, and he is certainly worthy of our commemoration and worship. Therefore, the Premier's death is the greatest loss for our party and the entire nation, and also the greatest loss for oppressed peoples all over the world. Therefore, when the anniversary of the Premier's death arrives, all comrades and compatriots throughout the country should have the following awareness and make the following efforts:</p>
<p>I. The Greatness of the Premier's Revolutionary Cause (1) The Creation of the Three Principles of the People: At the time, the Premier saw the corruption of the Qing government and the oppression of imperialism, so he determined that to save China, it was necessary to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic. He based this on the national ideas left by his ancestors and the democratic ideas of Chinese and foreign scholars, responding to the needs of the times by creating the Three Principles of the People to be the goal of the revolution. He also sought to resolve the issue of people's livelihood at the same time, thus adding the Principle of People's Livelihood. The creation of the Three Principles of the People established the highest principle of the Chinese revolution, which is truly a compilation of the revolutionary theories of our country and the world. (2) Organizing the Revolutionary Party: The revolutionary cause cannot be accomplished by a few people alone, nor can it be effective if everyone fights on their own. To universally ignite the high tide of revolution and centrally engage in practical action, there must be a revolutionary organization, working together with collective wisdom and strength to facilitate progress. Therefore, in 1893, the Premier began to contact secret societies, gather overseas Chinese, and establish the Revive China Society to promote the revolutionary cause. Although it failed twice afterward, revolutionary ideas spread more and more widely. The Premier later gathered heroes from all over the country to establish the Revolutionary Alliance, and from then on, the revolutionary tide progressed rapidly, finally leading to the establishment of the Republic of China in the Xinhai Revolution. Subsequently, due to internal corruption, it was reorganized twice to become the only revolutionary party now. (3) Establishing the Republic of China: The Premier's purpose in engaging in revolution was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish an independent and free country governed by the people, for the people, and enjoyed by the people. From the autumn of Yihai, when he began working on the revolution, until the Wuchang Uprising in the Xinhai year, he had carried out more than ten attempts. However, the Premier did not lose heart because of this, rising repeatedly, making persistent efforts, and finally overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China, achieving a great revolutionary cause. Later, when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, Duan Qirui signed the demonic treaties, and the deposed emperor was restored, the Premier resolutely shouldered great difficulties in this extremely critical situation and fought against all reactionary forces, preserving a glimmer of hope for the Chinese National Revolution and establishing the solid foundation for today's unified nation. Whatever was accomplished was all the great revolutionary cause created by the Premier throughout his life.</p>
<p>II. Appropriate Efforts to Commemorate the Premier's Death (1) Continuing the Premier's Revolutionary Spirit: The Premier was born for revolution and died for revolution. In a difficult environment, he fought for national freedom and the interests of the people, becoming stronger with each setback, making persistent efforts, and finally overcoming everything and achieving a great cause. This spirit of "not being corrupted by wealth, not being moved by poverty, and not being subdued by force" is worth emulating. We must put in tenfold effort to complete this important mission with the Premier's revolutionary spirit. (2) Realizing the Construction of the Three Principles of the People: The ultimate goal of the National Revolution is to realize the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, after the work of the destructive period of the revolution is completed, it should be followed by the construction of the Three Principles of the People, so that the theory of the Three Principles of the People becomes a concrete national and social organization.</p>
<p>Then China will have a clear political system, the people will have a happy life, and the country's free and equal status can be achieved. (3) Abolishing Unequal Treaties: Unequal treaties are China's bill of sale. As long as unequal treaties are not abolished, China cannot be free and equal. In the past few years, efforts in diplomacy have had considerable results, but the entire work of abolishing unequal treaties has not yet been fully accomplished. The instructions of the Premier's will are precisely the urgent work of today. Therefore, in commemorating the Premier's death, we must not forget this essential task.</p>
<p>▲Slogans 1. Commemorate the great personality of the Premier. 2. Commemorate the Premier's revolutionary spirit. 3. Complete the revolutionary cause of the Premier. 4. Unanimously support the central government and consolidate the foundation of the party. 5. Eliminate construction obstacles and stabilize social order. 6. Vigorously implement local autonomy and complete political tutelage construction. 7. Vow to abide by the Premier's teachings and abolish unequal treaties. 8. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 9. Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party. 10. Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong route will be resumed. The Yuan'an Wheel was formerly the Yisheng of Jardine Matheson, purchased from Jardine Matheson by Zhao. After the May 30th Incident, it was assigned to the Nanhua route. In less than two years, it made tens of thousands of yuan in profit. Zhao then used this surplus to purchase another ship, the Jiping. The hull, machinery, and passenger cabins of the Yuan'an are all excellent and sturdy. The sale is currently being negotiated, and it can set sail as soon as the lease is signed.</p>
<h3>Newchwang Thawing and Resumption of Navigation</h3>
<p>▲Starts on the 14th</p>
<p>Since the river in Newchwang froze, all ships have been suspended for a long time. Recently, due to the warming weather in the north, all places have thawed, and Yingkou is also navigable. The Taikoo Company received a telegram from its Yingkou branch requesting that a ship be sent to transport cargo. Yesterday, it was decided that the Newchwang line would be resumed starting on the 14th, and the Ningbo, Zhejiang, and Newchwang wheels have been dispatched to run this route.</p>
<h3>Achievements in Confiscating Opium and Other Prohibited Items by Customs Throughout the Country</h3>

<h3>Good News for Tenant Farmers in Baoshan</h3>
<p>▲Method for Resolving Military Land Disputes</p>
<p>▲Implementation Began the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>In the various districts of Baoshan County, during the Qing Dynasty, there were many fields used for military garrisoning. Since the Xinhai Revolution, the county has been surveying land in various districts, resulting in a distinction between military and civilian land. Military land was claimed by several large households who invested in land from the government, leading to years of disputes with the tenant farmers and smallholders who cultivated the military land for a living, resulting in a backlog of cases. The Baoshan County Government has now approved a method for resolving military land disputes, which has been implemented since the day before yesterday. The general tenant farmers and smallholders are all celebrating with joy.</p>
<h3>Henan Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai Responds to Telegram from Prominent Figures from Henan</h3>
<p>▲Please Ask the Authorities to be Compassionate After the Calamity</p>
<p>▲Revoke the Additional Security Fee by Order</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua, Pacification Commissioner of the Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi Border Area, et al., regarding the new security team to be established by the Henan Provincial Government, which will levy an additional 6 jiao per tael on land tax, a staggering amount, which the survivors after the disaster cannot bear, telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Chairman Liu on a specified day, requesting that the additional security fee be revoked by order to relieve the suffering of the people. Fan Zhengbo, chairman of the Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai, read the telegram and expressed strong approval. He has responded by telegram and also sent a separate telegram to Chairman Liu. Two telegrams are recorded below: (1) Urgent, to the Pacification Commissioner Liu Xueya of the Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi Border Area of Xinxiang, Henan, and transferred to the Commander Li Xiaodong, Commander-in-Chief Ji Shiwei, and Army Commander Liang Zichao: We received the telegrams sent by you to Chairman Chiang and Chairman Liu, informing us that the Henan Provincial Government has newly established a security team, setting up a headquarters in the provincial capital, training four regiments, and requiring more than 200,000 yuan per month, which will be financed by collecting a security fee of 6 jiao per tael on land tax, starting from the implementation of the tax in the 20th year, with the entire province divided into six districts, and the security teams in each district still financed locally, amounting to no less than several million yuan. You believe that this move by the provincial government is skinning the people alive and that it is a method of drinking poison to quench thirst. Therefore, you sincerely appeal and plead for the people, asking the provincial government to quickly implement a plan to prevent future problems and avoid the mistake of mending the fence after the sheep have been stolen. The words are weighty, and the intentions are accurate. After reading it repeatedly, we cannot help but feel worried and happy. Henan has suffered from frequent disasters, and the people are poor and exhausted. The survivors after the calamity cannot bear the burden again. We fellow provincials here, although living in a foreign land, are deeply concerned about our homeland. We dare to follow in your footsteps and plead for the millions of dying victims. We hope that you will work hard nearby to achieve the goal. We specially send a telegram to respond to your consideration. All fellow provincials of the Henan Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai kowtow, Ma. (1) Urgent, to Chairman Jing Fuxing of the Henan Provincial Government in Kaifeng: It is reported that the officials Xiaodong, Xueya, Shiwei, Zichao, etc. telegraphed to you, informing you that your government will levy an additional 6 jiao per tael on land tax as a fee for the newly established security team. Although you are making plans, the system is still in development and requires further assessment, and the decision is not final. However, the funding for the security team, according to the regulations, should be provided by the provincial treasury. If the survivors after the disaster bear the burden again, the benefits of the previous security will not be received, and the pain of being exploited will be experienced first, which may not be something that you would like to see. We, fellow provincials, are in a foreign land but are deeply concerned about our homeland. Therefore, we dare to sincerely appeal and plead for the people, earnestly asking you to consider the suffering of the millions of victims while preparing for the security team and approve the immediate revocation of the order to levy additional taxes in order to relieve the people's suffering and save them from danger. We cannot help but plead with anxiety and expectation. All fellow provincials of the Henan Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai kowtow, Zhen.</p>

<h3>Actual Situation of the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association Handling the Bandit Disaster in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>In recent years, various provinces have suffered successive disasters, and Jiangsu Province has not been spared. The counties of Suxian, Siyang, Yancheng, and Funing in northern Jiangsu experienced both floods and banditry last year, one following the other. During the turn of spring to summer, excessive rainfall led to floods, inundating fields and leaving them covered in mud. Poor households were left impoverished and emaciated, their homes empty and desolate, and their fields, though not barren, often abandoned. This is the real situation of the floods in these counties. Bandits rose up, forming gangs, entrenched themselves in the villages, and established their own factions. They kidnapped people for ransom as a matter of course, and engaged in arson and murder at will. They sometimes merged and sometimes separated, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Generally, the stronger the resistance, the more tragic the consequences. Some families were burned to death, and some incidents involved the burning of dozens or even hundreds of homes. This is the real situation of the banditry in these counties. In other areas, such as the villages of Rugao and Taixing counties, bandits arose, and both the rich and the poor suffered. They looted, burned, and killed for nearly seven months. The National Relief Commission allocated 30,000 yuan, and the Provincial Relief Association allocated 14,000 yuan, both of which were handed over to the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association to handle emergency relief. The association has now appointed directors for each county: Liu Shulun for Suqian, Li Yushu for Siyang, Chen Borong for Yancheng and Funing, and Zhang Zhongkuan for Rugao and Taixing, who are proceeding with investigations and distributions. However, the disaster is widespread, and the funds are insufficient, making thorough relief difficult. There is no lack of compassionate and benevolent people within the country who, if they can open their purses, can relieve this parched land, allowing the dying victims to prolong their lives. Such charitable acts will bring boundless blessings for generations to come. This is a sincere plea from the disaster victims, bowing repeatedly to implore assistance.</p>

<h3>Candidates for the Municipal Council Discuss</h3>
<p>▲Unanimously Advocate Purchasing the Great China Hotel</p>
<p>▲Attention to Extra-Settlement Roads</p>
<p>Annuar, Blair, and Fukushima, candidates for the Municipal Council, expressed their opinions to Western reporters yesterday on the acquisition of the Great China Hotel property, the sale of existing Municipal Council buildings, the expansion of open spaces in the Eastern and Northern Districts, and the issue of extra-settlement roads.</p>
<p>▲Blair's Opinion Blair did not express any opinion on the acquisition of the Great China property and the sale of existing Municipal Council buildings. He said that the matter is currently under discussion. As for the expansion of open spaces in the Northern and Eastern Districts, he strongly supported it, as open spaces are very much needed in the industrial area. Blair believes that it is best to negotiate with the Chinese authorities on the issue of extra-settlement roads and said that the Municipal Council has begun negotiations but has not yet achieved results. He strongly supports the Municipal Council's open policy and agrees with Sheppert's views.</p>
<p>Annuar's Opinion Annuar believes that although the current location of the Great China Hotel is far from the center of Shanghai, the Great China vicinity may become the center of Shanghai in the future. He believes that this issue and the expansion of open spaces in the Eastern and Northern Districts are currently important tasks. Annuar believes that before a proper solution is found to the issue of extra-settlement roads, there should be temporary measures to repair the roads, as some roads are already in a dangerous state. He strongly disapproves of the fact that important officials in the bureau often give interviews to reporters, as this can easily lead to outside suspicions as to whether someone's statements represent the Municipal Council or their personal opinions.</p>
<p>▲Fukushima's Opinion Fukushima expressed opposition to the sale of existing Municipal Council buildings and strongly supported the acquisition of the Great China property. However, he argues that proper attention must also be paid to the economic aspects. Fukushima is currently unwilling to express any opinion on issues such as extra-settlement roads.</p>
<h3>Zou Aizhen Files Counter-Suit Against Dr. Tang, Sentence to Be Pronounced</h3>
<p>▲In addition to requesting a divorce</p>
<p>▲Private lawsuit attached for 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>▲Sentencing scheduled for the 14th</p>
<p>The case of Economic Doctor Tang Huixuan, who was sued by his wife Zou Aizhen in the District Court Prosecutor's Office for bigamy and slander, has been publicly prosecuted and the trial has not yet concluded. The presiding judge Zhao Yongzhou, out of caution, recently led police to Zou Aizhen's residence at 821 Zhonghua Road to conduct an on-site inspection. The trial was resumed yesterday, with Judge Zhao and Prosecutor Wu presiding. First, Zou Yuanshi was called to testify, age 59, resident of 821 Zhonghua Road. (Question) Do you still live in the same place? (Answer) Because I can't stand the harassment, I now live in my mother's home in the Caohejing countryside. Aizhen was born to a previous wife. (Question) Who is Chen Genwei to you? (Answer) A foster child, who came to my home at the age of twelve. (Question) Where did Chen Genwei go in 1926? (Answer) To Beijing, but he still lived in my house when he came back. (Question) What about 1927? (Answer) I don't remember. (Question) What about 1929? (Answer) At home. (Question) Tang Huixuan said that Chen and Aizhen were having an affair. (Answer) That's not true. If Chen really had something wrong, I would never allow him to live in my house. (Question) Why did the police arrest him? (Answer) Chen lives in the back building, and Aizhen, Yuezhen, and two children, five people in total, live in the front building. (Question) What about the pavilion room? (Answer) It's the nanny's bedroom. (Question) How were you sleeping on the day the police came? (Answer) Because it was hot, the five of us slept in the same room, etc. The court summoned Tang Huixuan. (Question) About the bigamy part? (Answer) The documents were forged by them. (Question) About the slander part? (Answer) I was really wronged. Aizhen and I were a loving couple for many years. I hope she realizes her mistakes. I don't care about the past. I hope we can still be a good couple. I wrote to her, instructing her to break off her relationship with Chen, but she didn't realize her mistakes, so how sad and heartbroken I am. Chen Genwei said that I was using him. Ask, even people without knowledge would not say bad things about their own wife, let alone me, who occupies a position in society, would never do such a thing. Now my face and reputation are bankrupt, and even my property has been confiscated by them. They even bit me back, saying that I slandered her. Please, your honorable judge, be fair and uphold justice. Zou Aizhen testified, My father died early, leaving only my old mother. He bullied me, an orphan and a widow. Please, the judge, judge fairly. I am now raising two children and cannot go out to work. (Question) Are you still a couple with Tang, and will you reconcile? (Answer) He has twice falsely accused me. It is difficult to live together, especially since my reputation has been tarnished. The official said, You have been married for more than ten years, and you have two children. It is better not to divorce. (Answer) He deliberately framed me. He abandoned me. It is impossible to agree to live together, etc. Chen Genwei was then called to the court. (Question) Do you have anything else to say? (Answer) He used me and also used the court to insult me, etc. The judge then ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Wu then gave a speech, and the defendant's lawyer, Yuan Yang'an, stood up and defended the defendant for a long time. Wang Deyi, the lawyer hired by the plaintiff Zou Aizhen, stood up and requested a private prosecution, stating that the plaintiff is only twenty-six years old this year. Until the age of sixty, she should need 1,000 yuan per year for consolation money, totaling 34,000 yuan. Also, the two children born are still young and should be temporarily guarded by the plaintiff, but since the defendant is their father, he should be responsible for their education, calculating at least 8,000 yuan per person until they reach adulthood, totaling 16,000 yuan, both totaling 50,000 yuan, and requested permission for divorce, etc. The judge then declared the debate over and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Husband of Bai Beichen in Suicide Case</h3>
<p>▲Came to Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the truth of his wife's death</p>
<p>▲Described the circumstances of Bai Beichen's departure</p>
<p>Xu Xihe, the husband of Bai Beichen, the protagonist in the love suicide case, came to Shanghai yesterday to visit the Moon Palace Hotel to inquire about the truth of his wife's suicide, and packed up her posthumous belongings and took them away. The loss of his sword and cloud, seeing things and remembering people, his sad and unbearable state was indeed difficult for the husband of another person's lover. Xu arrived at the Moon Palace around 8:00 AM. In addition to Xu and an old man, there were also Xu's family member Xu Hua and Bai Beichen, the "two crystallizations of injustice" mentioned in the suicide note, a five-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter. After entering the door and stating his intention, he asked where the room where Bai Beichen died was, and wished to see it. Inspector Zhou Xingwu, who had handled the aftermath of the couple, led the five men, women, old and young, into Room 12. Xu Xihe looked around, sat quietly on the sofa, and spoke to Zhou, frowning frequently. Hearing about the situation after her death, he sighed for a long time. Xu told Zhou that the various circumstances of his wife's departure were still vivid in his mind, as if it were yesterday. He said, That day was a Monday, and all the agencies in the capital were doing the weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen. Usually, his wife would go to the Ministry of Communications to work before 9:00 AM, but that day was different. The clock struck nine, but she was not yet dressed, holding her second daughter in her arms, and chatting with me. I asked why she wasn't going to do the memorial service. She replied that her legs were unusually painful today, and she couldn't walk well, so she planned to see a doctor. I nodded. Around 10:00 AM, she went out, only saying that she was going to the hospital for treatment. I didn't expect her to have other intentions. The only difference was that at noon, I would usually call her office to ask when she would return home for dinner, but that day, his wife told him not to call him about lunch when she went out, I thought she had something to do elsewhere, and I casually agreed. I never expected that she would not return after noon, and there was no news at night. I was shocked. The next morning, I rushed to the Ministry of Communications to inquire, but there was no news. When I saw the Shanghai newspaper, publishing the love suicide, I began to suspect and fear, and I never expected that after coming here to inquire today, the deceased was indeed my wife. He couldn't help but sob. Afterwards, he went to the Public Security Bureau of the Fifth District to inquire about Bai's belongings. Because the clothes and other items were stored in the Nanshi Main Bureau, Director Tao Xiu wrote a letter instructing Xu to take them to identify them. According to Xu, he originally wanted to lead his children to the Jianghuai Guild Hall to pay respects to Bai Beichen's coffin, but later failed to go because it was too late. Xu told people that he and Bai had been married for eight years, and thinking back to the feelings of the couple, he couldn't bear to have the coffin and funerary items be too meager, so he planned to prepare quilts and pillows again, and put them in the coffin a second time. Bai Beichen's two children, the older one is named Jingduan, and the younger one is Xu Wan.</p>
<h3>Accident of Shanghai Zhang Route Tongxin Steamer</h3>
<p>▲Violently Hit by Sand Ship</p>
<p>▲Full of Water, Sunk to River Bottom</p>
<p>▲Eight or Nine Passengers Missing</p>
<p>▲One Man Crushed Severely</p>
<p>Lihang Company's Shanghai Zhang route Tongxin Steamer, every morning at 9:00 AM, from Zhangjiang Zha town in Nanhui County, Pudong, towing a passenger boat, sailed to the Shanghai Dongjiadu Wharf, and at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it sailed back to Zhangzhen from Shanghai, as a daily routine. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, it towed a passenger boat again, departing from Shanghai to Zhang, first sailing south to near the Yangguan outside Bansongyuan, then turning east, intending to enter Bailianjing Port. Unexpectedly, as it approached the center of the river, it was about 2:30 PM, and suddenly a wooden sand ship sailed quickly from the north with its sails up. The steamer sounded a return whistle, indicating that the sand ship should sail behind the steamer, but the sand ship, due to a problem with the steering gear, was careless and did not give way to the steamer, causing it to violently hit the stern of the steamer. The steamer was usually sailing on inland rivers, and its hull was very small, so it could not withstand the impact of the sand ship. The steamer tilted to the side, and river water poured in, filling the cabin in an instant, and the entire ship sank to the bottom of the river. There were a total of six crew members on board. One was rescued by the Yangguan, four were quick-witted and jumped onto the sand ship to escape, and eleven passengers were also rescued. One man was rescued by the water patrol team because he fell between the steamer and the sand ship, and was crushed severely. He was unconscious, so his name was not known. A woman was rescued by a sampan. About eight or nine people were missing. The rescued man was handed over to the water patrol police station steamer by the team and transported to the police station. Detective Ge Changsheng sent him by car to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries were quite serious and his life was in danger. The passenger boat towed behind the steamer carried a total of fifty or sixty people, and because the cable had been released at that time, it was not affected, but they were all temporarily stranded in Shanghai. Afterwards, the steamer's captain, Ni A’gen, reported to the water patrol police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Record of the Interrogation of the Kidnappers in the Liu Tongyun Case</h3>
<p>▲Ji Taozi Confesses to the Kidnapping</p>
<p>▲Miao Liucheng Acknowledges Ji's Statements</p>
<p>Liu Tongyun, the manager of the Fuji Paper Shop in Chungeng Lane, Eduard Road, was kidnapped by bandits at 8:00 PM on the evening of September 19th last year at the entrance of Chungeng Lane and was later ransomed. Recently, the Gordon Road Police arrested Miao Liucheng, a Jiangbei man, a suspect in the case. According to his confession, Ji Taozi (also known as Er Taozi), who was arrested by the French Concession Police, was his accomplice. A detective was sent to bring Ji back, and yesterday morning, he was taken to the Special District Court for trial by Judge Ge. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that after the bandits kidnapped Liu, they hid him at No. 6 Xinle Lane, Mintini Road. The house was leased by the Pingzhiming Foreign Company. He has sent someone to testify in court, which can prove the rental situation. Zhu Zuoqing, the collector of Pingzhiming, testified that in July last year, the person who came to rent the house at No. 6 was a robust man about forty years old, who said that he was renting the house to open the Huhexing Cloth Factory. The house was rented for about three months and he never owed rent, etc. Then, according to Ji Taozi, the reason why he was arrested by the French Concession and sent to the French Court was also for the Liu case. He has now been sentenced to five years in prison and will be sent to the interior for execution, but the fact that Liu was kidnapped was initiated by Jiang A’san, Tang Mingfang, etc., who are at large. They first gathered in Room 501 of the Continental Hotel, discussed and decided on a plan, and then I called Miao Liucheng to go to Chungeng Lane. When Liu came out, we recognized his face. On the night of September 19th, we saw Liu getting into his car in the lane. We held a gun and forbade him to make a sound, chased away his driver, and we jumped into the car. One of our accomplices, a driver with a pockmarked face, drove south along Changbang Road and sped to Xinle Lane, then took Liu out of the car and into the No. 6 house in the lane, and imprisoned him in the back building. Three people were sent to guard him in shifts every day. Miao also worked as a guard. He was imprisoned for about half a month, and then he was ransomed. I don’t know how much the ransom was or how it was handled. Later, the ransom money was distributed in the Chunjiang Hotel in the French Concession, and I got 800 gold, etc. After Ji finished his confession, he stated that Ji's statements were all true, and he had nothing to add. Judge Ge, because Liu Tongyun had not yet complied with the summons to appear in court, and it was necessary to question him, ordered Ji and Miao to be remanded in custody and wait for Liu to arrive, and rescheduled the trial for the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers in Ding Ziren Case Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>▲To be executed after confirmation</p>
<p>The French Police recently arrested three kidnappers, Yang Wu, etc., who were found to have kidnapped Ding Ziren, the manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill on Moganshan Road in West Shanghai on December 19th of last year. The police in charge were notified and Detective Ji Liren and Detective Ma Zonglai took Yang and others to the Special District Court for questioning. Yang's crime was confirmed, but the other two had no evidence of being bandits. Judge Wu opened the court yesterday morning, announced the verdict, Yang Wu was sentenced to death for jointly kidnapping and demanding ransom, Chen Shixing and Chen Kaixiang were innocent. After the sentencing, the police took Yang and others away and temporarily detained them for execution after confirmation.</p>
<h3>Bandit's True Audacity: Publicly Negotiating Extortion</h3>
<p>▲ Two Bandits and Two Mistresses Caught by the Police</p>
<p>▲ Involved in Kidnapping in Addition to Extortion</p>
<p>Yun Yong, the principal of the Xielong Real Estate Company located at No. 313 Yingchun Fang, Hubei Road, was the target of a kidnapping attempt by several bandits at 9:30 AM on February 8th of this year. They intended to kidnap him for ransom, but mistakenly abducted his friend, Li Weiqing, who managed to escape shortly after. Subsequently, Yun received numerous threatening letters signed by Tang Yong, initially demanding 30,000 yuan, later reduced to 20,000 yuan. Yun ignored these demands and did not report the matter to the police. On the 8th of this month, Yun suddenly received a phone call from the bandits, arranging a meeting at Room 316 of the New World Hotel at 1:00 PM that afternoon. Yun sent his employee, Zeng Yisheng, to the room, but no one was there. Soon after, he received another phone call, instructing Zeng to go to the Pingqiao Hotel for negotiations. Zeng went and found four people there. Negotiations failed due to significant differences in the amount demanded. The day before yesterday morning, Yun received another phone call, arranging a meeting at Room 301 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM that afternoon for further negotiations. Yun sent Zeng again. However, Zeng, realizing the illegality of the matter, reported it to Hua Detective Yu Agen of the Old Zha Police Station. Detective Yu, along with Hua Detectives Song Bingzheng, Zhang Yi, Liu Chunshu, Weng Hong, Wang Ruiqing, and others, secretly went to wait. At 4:10 PM, Zhou Linsheng from Pudong arrived and was immediately arrested. Twenty minutes later, Lu Agen from Yangzhou arrived and was also arrested. Zeng Yisheng identified both men as two of the four people he had negotiated with at the Pingqiao Hotel. They were taken back to the police station. Subsequently, the police went to No. 539 Aiduya Road, where they apprehended Zhou's mistress, Xu Yuying from Changzhou, and Lu's mistress, Wang Genmei from Pudong, and detained them separately. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special District Court. Judge Xu Jiashi presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the police were prosecuting Zhou Linsheng and Lu Agen under Article 370, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law and Article 1 of the Law for the Punishment of Kidnappers. Zhou Linsheng and Lu Agen had confessed to the charges at the police station, and the two women were also aware of the case. However, Zhou and Lu were also involved in multiple kidnapping cases, and the two women were even more crucial to the kidnapping cases. The police had not yet fully investigated due to time constraints and had not formally filed charges, requesting an extension. Subsequently, Detective Hua and Zeng Yisheng submitted reports detailing the circumstances of the arrest during the negotiation. When questioned, Zhou Linsheng and Lu Agen confessed that the case was initiated by a certain Wang, and they had both attended the two negotiations. The letters were also written by Wang. When questioned, Xu and Wang denied any involvement. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Xu ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>
<h3>New Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Thomson, Takes Office</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Thomson, the new Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the Public Concession, arrived in Shanghai on the Heiketu steamship the day before yesterday from England and took office at the Volunteer Corps Headquarters yesterday morning.

<h3>Property Valuation Association Appoints Chinese Committee Member</h3>
<p>▲ Mr. Kuai Yanfang</p>
<p>The estimation of house rentals in the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Concession has always been controlled by the Public Works Department, with no Chinese advisors. The Shanghai Real Estate Association previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department, seriously negotiating that the property valuation must have Chinese committee members participating in the discussion to be fair. Now, the Municipal Council Board of Directors has resolved that the Chinese side of the property valuation can appoint one committee member to participate in the deliberations. A letter has been sent to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, and it is learned that the representative Chinese committee member appointed by the association is Mr. Kuai Yanfang.</p>
<h3>General Meeting of the China Merchants Public Bus Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Merchants Public Bus Company held its third shareholders' meeting yesterday. 169 households attended, representing a total of 4,762 shares. Lei Zhaopeng chaired the meeting. Yao Zhongliang, a section chief from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, attended to review the shares. First, the chairman delivered a speech, followed by reports from various department heads on business conditions, operating status in 19, and hopes for future plans. There are plans to add a fourth route, starting from the North Railway Station, passing through Jiangwan Road, Yinxiang Road, and directly reaching Songhu Road to the entrance of Hujiang University. The municipal government is currently planning to pave Yinxiang Road with asphalt, and it is expected that public buses will be allowed to operate. It is believed that the opening of this route will become a reality. Next, the election of directors and supervisors took place. As a result, Lei Zhaopeng, Wu Hongshu, Tan Yanchuang, Huang Zhongwen, Lei Jiaang, Lei Shengchun, Huang Nengwen, Zhang Bingrong, and Shi Tifen were elected as directors.

<h3>Municipal Ferry Extends Service to Gaoqiao Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Public Buses to Gaoqiao Town Also Start Operating Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has been actively preparing for the extension of municipal ferry service to Gaoqiao to meet demand, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the first day of the extended service. A total of three ferries, Nos. 1, 3, and 4, operated round trips, totaling 28 trips. In addition, public buses from the municipal government, running from the Gaoqiao Wharf to Gaoqiao Town, also started operating simultaneously to pick up and drop off passengers. It is reported that yesterday, there were as many as five or six hundred people who purchased tickets from the Tongren Wharf and took the municipal ferry directly to Gaoqiao. From now on, transportation between the town and Puxi will be more convenient, which will greatly benefit its future development.</p>
<h3>Electric Lights Added to Shanghai South Municipal Ferry Terminals</h3>
<p>▲ Piers Nos. 1 to 7</p>
<p>▲ Lights Turned On Last Night</p>
<p>Shanghai South Municipal ferry terminals, from the road to the floating bridge, already have street lights installed. However, the floating docks, being outside the floating bridge, cannot be illuminated by street lights. After the Bureau of Public Utilities took over, it considered that these docks are used by coastal, Yangtze River, and inland river commercial vessels for berthing. Except for inland river vessels, which arrive and depart during the day, others do so at night, making the loading and unloading of passengers and goods extremely dangerous. Moreover, in the darkness, it is easy for petty thieves to carry out their tricks, which hinders public security. Therefore, the bureau requested and received approval from the municipal government to allocate funds to install four-gang , a total of forty-eight , on these docks. It is reported that the lights on floating docks Nos. 1 to 7 were turned on last night, and those below No. 8 are also being installed. The intensity of these electric lights is strong enough to greatly benefit travelers, and the loading and unloading of goods can also reduce theft and pickpocketing.</p>
<h3>Shipping Representatives Request Preservation of Harbors</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang and others, representatives of shipping merchants from Pudong West, jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, requesting the preservation of existing harbors to maintain commerce along the banks of the Huangpu River. The petition concerns the reorganization of harbors along the Huangpu River, removing obstacles, and facilitating transportation. The petition states that merchants along the Huangpu River in Nanshi rely heavily on trade with rural passengers and shipping. It is feared that the expansion and occupation of these harbors by the Bureau of Shipping will hinder rural ships from docking, which will negatively affect commerce in Nanshi. The petitioners were greatly alarmed. Therefore, in March of last year, the petitioners jointly submitted a petition to the former Municipal Port Authority, requesting that the public docks south of Wanyu Dock be permanently designated as berths for rural ships to maintain shipping. The petitioners received a reply stating, "The petition has been noted. The Bureau is currently planning all public docks in Nanshi to benefit merchants and residents. All existing docks will not face any problems. Please do not worry." The Wanyu, Gongyi, Yongsheng, and Nanhui Guan docks have always been used as berths for rural ships, with Nanhui Guan Dock being the most frequented. Recently, it has been covered with scattered lumber, preventing rural ships from docking. They are forced to stay far in the center of the river. Passengers have to walk on uneven lumber before reaching the shore. Furthermore, a group of boat women obstruct them and demand money for using the gangplank, causing much disruption. Moreover, many large ships and kiln cargo ships are parked near the docks, blocking the way and hindering rural ships from entering and exiting. In the event of strong winds and waves, collisions occur, damaging property and leading to quarrels. To ensure passenger safety and the commerce along the Huangpu River, the petitioners must request reorganization. Therefore, they jointly submit this petition to the authorities, requesting approval to instruct the Bureau of Public Utilities and the Bureau of Public Safety to properly plan and remove all obstacles to benefit shipping and travel and facilitate transportation, for which the petitioners will be eternally grateful.</p>

<h3>The Reputation of the Famous National Medicine Bu'er Fei Jing</h3>
<p>The lung disease specific medicine Bu'er Fei Jing produced by Shumin Company is said to be mainly made of domestic Hu ointment, supplemented by valuable raw materials such as Ganju Er. It has been repeatedly verified and proven by Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, Ding Fubao, Ding Huikang, Liu Zhigang, Jiang Zhenxun, Zhu Qiluo, Guo Renji, etc., and has been tested and proven effective by the Central Health Testing Institute. Recently, it has been reported that major hospitals in Shanghai, such as the Chinese Lung Hospital, Shanghai Lung Sanatorium, Public Shanghai Hospital, Shenjiang Hospital, Zhonghua Hospital, and Xieqiao Hospital, have all adopted it. Orders from other places number dozens per day, causing the company to manufacture day and night, yet supply still falls short of demand. The general manager's office is located at No. 190 Ningbo Road, Huaji Huaxing, and a lung treatment guide is printed, which is given away upon request.</p>

<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>▲ In Chicago, USA, to test the rate of descent of parachutes in the event of an airplane accident, a competition was held between airplanes and parachutes. They were dropped simultaneously from a height of 1,500 feet . As a result, the parachute was slightly faster by a few seconds.</p>
<p>▲ The Royal Geographical Society of the United Kingdom displays a silver map. It is considered one of the four finest maps in the world. The map is a circular thin silver plate. It is only three inches in diameter. It commemorates the voyage around the world by Drake from 1577 to 1580.</p>
<p>▲ In Cullompton, Devon, England, every so often, clear springs gush out from the streets of the entire town. They gather in pools to supply the needs of the citizens. However, they cannot be used as drinking water.</p>
<p>▲ In Stroebeck, Germany, the villagers take chess as their only entertainment. It has never changed in eight hundred years. It is included in the curriculum in schools to teach children so that it will not be lost in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Alcester, Warwickshire, England, is a place specializing in the manufacture of needles. All the small needles used by women in the country are supplied from here, and there are also exports. Forty percent of the needle workers are women.</p>
<p>▲ In Switzerland, there is a butcher who made a living by slaughtering animals. Later, for some reason, he pretended to be a doctor and practiced medicine. He hired nine doctors as assistants.

<p>▲ In Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, the hot water used is taken from the hot springs outside the city. Therefore, the supply of coal can be saved.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Martyr Zhou Shuiping</h3>
<p>— Zhu Meiyu</p>
<p>The martyr's surname was Zhou, and his given name was Shuiping. He was from Gushan Township, Jiangyin, Jiangsu. In his youth, he studied in Japan. After becoming a member of the Kuomintang, he devoted himself to the party's cause. He particularly dedicated himself to the peasant movement. In the winter of the 14th year of the Republic of China, the martyr gathered peasants to organize the Tenant Self-Help Association, demanding a reduction in land rent to seek the liberation of the peasants. At that time, Sun Chuanfang occupied Jiangsu, and the Kuomintang had not yet been publicly established, resulting in the resentment of thirty-eight gentry, who falsely accused him of being a communist and reported him to the provincial government. He was arrested and imprisoned. Those who heard about it were worried about the martyr, knowing that he would inevitably be crushed under the iron hooves of the warlords.</p>
<p>The thirty-eight gentry falsely accused the martyr of being a communist to the provincial government. At that time, the government officials hated the party members to the bone. Therefore, they all held the attitude of wishing to put the martyr to death. They sentenced him to the extreme penalty of beheading in Jiangyin City. His head was hung for three days on the wall of the county government for public display. This happened at 6:00 AM on January 17th of the 15th year. Passersby could not help but cover their faces and shed tears. How tragic.</p>
<p>After the martyr's death, the National Revolutionary Army marched south and arrived in Jiangsu. The people of Jiangyin were deeply indignant and organized the Zhou Case Committee to handle the case. They sent a telegram to the province requesting the arrest of the thirty-eight wanted criminals. But the wanted criminals had already fled far away upon hearing the news. This case has been suspended for nearly five years. Is the martyr's wronged soul not resting in peace?</p>
<p>Hu Puan, the head of civil affairs, believed that the Zhou case had been suspended for too long, and the martyr's wronged soul had no way to appeal. Therefore, he formulated two measures, which were passed by both the provincial party and government. It was decided that the provincial government would implement them, ordering Sha Bingyuan and others to each contribute 2,000 yuan, and designating 50,000 yuan as the Zhou Shuiping Memorial Primary School fund. The remaining 26,000 yuan would be used for tomb repair and condolences. The Zhou case, which had been suspended for a long time and had shocked the country, was finally brought to an end.</p>
<p>I lived only a river away from the martyr, so I heard more details about the martyr's life. Therefore, I record it like this.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Self-Admonishing Couplet</h3>
<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, has served as the director of special tax bureaus for tobacco, alcohol, wheat, and flour. Recently, he was recommended by Minister Song to serve as the director of the Shanghai Mint. He is naturally generous and enthusiastic about public welfare. He has dozens of children, so his nickname is King of Many Children. He enters the stage after work to entertain himself. He sings Heitou roles, and his stage name is Detian. His voice is like a bell. He can perform many plays. It is said that his voice is so high that it is a gift from heaven. I met him yesterday. According to him, he recently wrote a couplet to admonish himself. The text reads: "For the country, for the society, both being an official and a businessman, all are making wedding clothes for others. Do not ask why in the end." "Do not love money, do not cherish wealth, not only do not be greedy or treacherous, but also do not care about livelihood. I am afraid that things will not end well in the future." He has asked Fang Jiaobo to write it out so that it can be hung beside his seat to express that he knows his own illness.</p>
<h3>Wireless Telephone in British Trains</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>When traveling on a train, in addition to reading books and newspapers, one often suffers from a lack of entertainment. Recently, British trains, in order to provide entertainment for passengers, have installed wireless telephones next to the seats inside the passenger cars. The method is good and the intention is good. It seems to be enough for our country to learn from. Therefore, the situation is translated below to fill this conversation.</p>
<p>Passengers on trains from King's Cross to Lee at 10:10 AM and from Lee to King's Cross at 5:30 PM can enjoy wireless telephone entertainment. There are many sockets inside each car, which are connected to the receiver in the conductor's room. Those who want to listen only need to spend one shilling to get a headset from the waiter. Insert the plug into the socket to hear clear singing.</p>
<p>The outside of the headset has a wooden box for protection to prevent the machinery from being damaged by the vibration of the train. During the test, the results were very good. However, when the car is traveling in a tunnel, it is greatly shielded from external electrical waves, so the sound reception is also reduced. It is reported that the Canadian National Railway Company has specially created a radio station, broadcasting music and reports at fixed times, specifically for the purpose of alleviating the loneliness of train passengers. The intention is particularly thorough.</p>
<h3>Scraps from Jiao Mountain Excursion</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>I previously wrote about my trip to Jinshan (Gold Mountain), which was published in this column. On the first of this month, my friend Mr. Nie was celebrating his mother's birthday in Zhenjiang, so I went to offer my congratulations and also had the opportunity to visit Jiao Mountain. According to the others who went along, Zhenjiang's scenic spots are said to be better at Jiao than Jin. Therefore, I will briefly record what I gained from this trip to leave a temporary mark.</p>
<p>Jinshan's Buddhist halls excel in their solemnity and grandeur. Upon ascending Jiao Mountain, one feels a distinct difference. Apart from the main hall, Jiao Mountain consists of exquisite temples and small nunneries facing each other across the hills. The winding paths lead to secluded spots, and the layout is exceptionally elegant and clean. Each nunnery has a name, such as Bishan (Emerald Mountain) and Ziran (Natural), forming a multitude that one cannot remember completely. The nunneries are built around the riverside. From the high points, one can take in the entire river view. Moreover, there are not many Buddha statues, but the calligraphy and paintings of famous people are everywhere. Among them, the works of Zhuang Yunkuan are the most numerous. There are also quite a few couplets by Lu Runxiang and Xu Shichang. According to the monks, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the provincial government moved to Zhenjiang, Jiao Mountain's scenic spots have attracted many important figures. In recent years, they have been intentionally renovated, costing a considerable amount, it is said.</p>
<p>The monks of Jiao Mountain Temple, in addition to worshiping the Buddha, also sell rubbings of inscriptions and calligraphy. It is said that some of the monks are skilled in writing. Those I met that day were mostly eloquent and did not come across as annoying. The nunneries that sell paintings display a rich collection. There are paintings of the Eight Immortals and of sparrows playing, with vivid expressions and meticulous brushwork. The asking price is a little over three yuan. One can also request to see works such as "Jiao Mountain Zhi" (Gazetteer of Jiao Mountain) and "Jiao Chushi Yiji" (Collected Works of Jiao Chushi). However, the price is quite high, usually over four yuan per volume.</p>
<p>The stone walls on the mountain are adorned with inscriptions. Stone workers are available to be hired by visitors. Poems and impromptu verses can be carved into the stone in an instant. People in our society often like to leave their names everywhere, and the stone workers take advantage of this psychology to make a living. Their annual income is quite considerable, making it a good business on Jiao Mountain.</p>
<p>Jiao Mountain has many treasures, which the monks are unwilling to show unless to esteemed guests. On this day, when we ascended Zhenjiang Pavilion, we had the opportunity to see three Buddha statues, a Buddha screen, and several ancient Duan inkstones, all of which are famous items. The Buddha statues are carved from crystal, sandalwood, and ivory, each depicting the Buddha in a seated position. They are less than a foot tall, but the carving is exceptionally skillful. The screen has ivory pieces, on which are engraved extremely fine Buddhas, as well as thousands of words of inscriptions and eulogies, all carved on a square inch, which is particularly impressive. It is unknown by whose hand they were made. In addition, there is a dragon robe, said to be a genuine item from the Qing dynasty emperors. Because it was late, we did not have time to view it, and we will have to wait for the next opportunity to appreciate it.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of the Old Mi Terrace</h3>
<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>The Bell Tower is located east of Tangjia Lane inside Fengmen (Feng Gate), very close to my home. The tower has three floors. A large bell hangs on the top floor, and statues of Zi Tong (God of Literature) are enshrined on the middle floor. It is said that on the second day of the second month of the lunar calendar, it is the god's birthday, and many scholars from near and far come to offer incense. The bottom floor is where monks set up Buddha statues. When I was young, I would wake up in the fifth watch (early morning) and hear a loud sound entering my ears, which was the sound of the monks ringing the bell on the tower. Later, it suddenly caught fire. However, the tower's structure was very sturdy, so although the wooden parts inside were completely burned, the outer walls remained intact. Even now, when passing Fengmen by boat, the huge structure that catches the eye is the ruins of the tower. However, the sound of the bell can no longer be heard. I once wrote a line about it: "A towering pavilion dedicated to Zi Tong, laughing at those who blindly believe in Zhang Feng. Since the Qiyun Pavilion was destroyed in a fire, the sound of the bell no longer carries in the evening breeze."</p>
<p>The elders passed down the saying that Suzhou has "seven pagodas, eight mansions, and nine mantou (steamed buns)." The seven pagodas refer to the North Temple Pagoda, Ruiguang Pagoda, Shangfang Pagoda, Tiger Hill Pagoda, Lingyan Pagoda, and the Twin Pagodas. The Twin Pagodas are located in Twin Pagoda Temple Lane inside Fengmen, next to the Gongyuan (Imperial Examination Hall). It was where the Qing Dynasty's Director of Studies tested scholars. I once wrote a line about it: "Wanting to sweep away a thousand troops from the literary battlefield, locked in the courtyard, indulging in contemplation at sunset. The shadows of the pagodas suddenly fall from the eaves, the twin sharp pens soaring with imposing momentum." Now, the Gongyuan has fallen into disrepair, and the Twin Pagodas are also on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Peach Blossom Hermitage is located in Peach Blossom Dock, where Mr. Tang Yin (Tang Bohu) of the Ming Dynasty studied. When I was young, I once visited it. There is a garden in the hermitage with dozens of peach trees planted. There is a pavilion with a statue of Tang Yin. I love the line Mr. Tang wrote when he was free: "Painting and selling pictures is my living, not letting my hands create evil money." I once wrote a line about it: "Peach blossoms bloom inside Peach Blossom Hermitage, where the banished immortal once lived. Only painting and selling pictures for a living, a true gentleman would refuse to drink from the Greedy Spring." Although I cannot reach his level, my heart aspires to it.</p>
<p>Brocade Sail Canal is located between Yinma Bridge and Xiahou Bridge on Hulong Street. In the past, King Fuchai of Wu and Xi Shi (one of the Four Beauties) would cruise here, with brocade sails adorning their boats, hence the name. When I was young, I saw that this canal was as narrow as a ditch. When the municipal government was established, because Xiahou Bridge was quite high and steep, making it inconvenient for vehicles, it was proposed to demolish and level it, thereby filling in the canal. As a result, the remnants of this narrow Brocade Sail Canal are no longer visible. I once wrote a line about it: "Cruising on brocade sails in the Brocade Sail Canal, palace maids as beautiful as flowers know no sorrow. Today, poets come to mourn the past, almost suspecting that it is possible to sail a boat on land."</p>

<h3>Warmth in the Heart (380)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Having the Art of Staying Young, Emerald Eyeliner Blurs Eyebrows; Lacking a Way to Extend Life, the Golden Market Offers a Thoroughbred's Bones</p>
<p>Hua Yuanchun's illness came on fiercely. At first, she was dizzy and vomiting, with a very high fever. Big-bellied A Jin thought that the girls had just caught a cold, which was nothing to worry about. She made her a bowl of ginger soup, adding some brown sugar, saying that perhaps her period was coming. By the next day, the chills and fever were worse, and she even babbled incessantly, saying only that she missed the people in Shanghai. Big-bellied A Jin said she was probably possessed by something evil. According to our southern customs, we should consult a diviner and send away the unwelcome guests. But in the north, there isn't even anyone who can read incense ashes. They invited a doctor who often saw patients in the alley. He said she had probably caught a little cold. Southern girls aren't as robust as northern girls. He prescribed a dispersing formula. By the third day, the chills and fever hadn't subsided, and the vomiting was even worse. She couldn't eat anything and felt restless in her chest. That night, Ye Tonghou came from Tianjin. When he was leaving, Hua Laoliu asked him to buy two pieces of clothing material. He brought the material with him to Qingyutang. As soon as he entered, the shop assistant told him that Sixth Miss was sick. Walking into the house, he saw A Jin, the one Laoliu told him to pawn the white gold watch to. Seeing Ye Tonghou, she said, "Third Master, we've been waiting so long our necks are stiff. How come you only came now? Sixth Miss's illness is quite serious. Chills and fever, boiling hot. She even talks nonsense at night. I'm so scared. When she's clear-headed, she still asks me if Third Master is coming." Ye Tonghou nodded and said, "Then let me go see her." They separated the first room of the three main rooms. The room on the top was Laoliu's bedroom, and the middle and bottom rooms were a single large room. Sister A Jin accompanied Third Master Ye, lifting the curtain and entering. He immediately smelled the odor of a sick person's room. At that time, it was already late autumn, early winter. The weather in the north was getting cold early, with a hint of desolation. Hua Laoliu was covered with an apricot-red silk quilt, with a pair of mandarin-red wool blankets on top. She was sleeping with her head covered. Sister A Jin walked up to her and whispered by her pillow, "Sixth Miss, Third Master you've been missing has come." Hua Laoliu groaned softly. Ye Tonghou said, "If she's asleep, don't wake her. I have nothing to do anyway. I'll sit outside for a while." Actually, Ye Tonghou was also afraid of staying in the sick person's room. When a girl gets sick, even ghosts won't come to the door. That kind of desolate scene is unbearable. Hua Laoliu was sleeping on a half-copper bed. On the table in front of the bed, there was an electric lamp with a green magnetic lampshade. It already emitted a gloomy light, and with the weak electricity in Beijing at that time, it seemed even more dim and gloomy, like entering a ghost market. Ye Tonghou was about to walk out when he suddenly heard Hua Yuanchun whimper. She stretched out a hand from the quilt and then let it fall back onto the quilt. Sister A Jin hurriedly tucked it back into the quilt. Laoliu asked softly and weakly, "Is that Third Master Ye?" Sister A Jin said, "Third Master has come from Tianjin. The clothing material you asked him to buy is here too."</p>

<h3>Financial News: Silver Prices Lengthen, with Marking Fees Falling Again</h3>
<p>▲ Breaking Through the 700 Taels Barrier</p>
<p>▲ Frequent Turbulence: Yesterday's Wild Fluctuations in the March 11th Marking Fee</p>
<p>The tumultuous changes and towering waves of the March 11th marking fee yesterday were commonplace, with fluctuations of ten taels in an instant. The market hovered around 700 taels in the morning. In the afternoon, it broke through 690 taels. From morning to evening, there was a difference of thirty-two taels, making it extremely difficult to predict. In the end, it continued to fall by more than fourteen taels. The foreign exchange situation was divergent, ultimately trending downward, with listed prices lengthening by one grade. Trading within the market was also disparate. Companies such as Yuan Mao Yongtai Xing bought in, while Heng Xing's intention to sell remained strong. Other companies like Da Heng Xing, Yuan Yuan Sheng, and Qian Chang Xiang bought and then sold, with uncertain and bewildered intentions. Silver markets overseas rose, causing gold prices to fall. Later, buyers became enthusiastic, especially with foreign exchange improving. April and May British gold could be sold at 1 shilling 3 pence 75 to 6875, stirring excitement. The gold price suddenly soared, reaching over 715 taels. But due to sellers stirring, and exchange rates suddenly easing, a sudden sharp reversal occurred, plummeting by thirty taels. The British gold bank absorbed over 1 shilling 4 pence 1875. In the afternoon, Heng Xing, Wan Xing, and others bought back, while Shunli, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan, and others sold. However, due to the lack of market on Wednesday, the exchange rate still fluctuated by ten taels, once falling below 684 taels. Later, it stood at ninety-three and four taels. Large bars may continue to rise this morning, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Opening Plunge: The April market opened sharply lower by eight taels and three qian, at 699 taels and five qian. This was because large bars were indeed up three-eighths, silver prices up three-quarters, and the United States was still expected to provide relief, with private telegrams lengthening by as much as 1.125. Therefore, market sentiment was extremely weak, and there were many short positions. Some had pre-arranged trades before the market opened, based on listed prices. It then fell to ninety-eight taels and a half. Suddenly, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Xing, Yuan Tai Xing, Xin Heng, and An Li and others entered the market in a flurry, immediately raising the price by ten taels. When the prices were announced, it was 708 taels. The listed prices were lengthened by 0.25, and the US dollar was lengthened by half a yuan. The Japanese gold fell by two and a half fen and was unaffected. At this time, Yuan Cheng and Yuan Heng also entered, and British gold within the bank was already stable early on. Mitsui and others initially offered 13.75, then absorbed at the same price, causing the price to rise to fourteen taels by 9:30. Shunli, Qian Chang Xiang, Wan Xing and others sold, immediately causing the price to fall by more than four taels. Around ten o'clock, it was within 710 taels. It suddenly rose again, with Goods and others competing to buy. Furthermore, Mitsui absorbed Japanese gold at 1 tael 5 qian 5 fen 115, and bought British gold from Anda and others at 13.6875. In just over ten minutes, it jumped six taels, to 715 taels and five qian at 10:12. Afterwards, it seemed to weaken, as the Dalian gang and Heng Xing and others eagerly dumped. Other firms followed suit in selling. With British gold strengthening and banks widening their margins, the market fell downstream. A storm-like deluge caused a drop of over twenty taels, until 693 taels at 11:30. It immediately rebounded by three or four taels, but British gold at 14125 was not easy to sell. Then, the same industry sold to Huabi at 141875. Selling pressure on the surface was especially strong, suddenly falling to 684 taels and eight qian at 11:45. Shortly after, Tai Xing, Tongtai Chang, and others bought, with one advantageous market pulling up six or seven taels to ninety-one and a half taels. It closed at ninety taels and five final points at noon. It continued to rise to ninety-one or two taels. The posted price was changed to 759 taels, suppressed by forty to forty-five or six taels. At noon, it was suppressed by small seventy taels and closed at sixty-seven and eight taels.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Weakness: The afternoon market opened at ninety-three taels, continuing to ninety-one taels. Afterwards, buying and selling varied among firms, with fluctuations of four or five taels. After 2:15, Fuchang and Yongheng entered the market, rising to ninety-five and a half taels. Suddenly, it was reported that the Indian exchange rate was large thirteen anna. With Shunli, Wanxing and others selling, the price suddenly plunged by ten taels. Around three o'clock, it was eighty-six taels. It then rose by four taels, but Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da and others eagerly sold, causing it to fall downstream. At 3:10, it plunged to eighty-three taels and three fen. Afterwards, Heng Xing, Yuan Cheng, Cheng Feng Yong, and others entered the market to buy, so it rose to ninety taels and two or three qian by four o'clock. At 4:10, it depreciated by two or three taels to eighty-seven and a half taels. After that, buyers became active. It was reported that the Indian exchange rate was again small six anna, immediately rising by six taels. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 693 taels and five qian, still down fourteen taels and three qian compared to the day before. In these three days, it had plummeted by more than fifty taels, unexpectedly. This was due to the stimulation of silver market lengthening. After the close, it rose again to more than ninety-five taels.

<h3>Lax Foreign Exchange Conditions</h3>

<h3>Securities and Bonds Prices Rebound by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>▲ Market Slightly Strong, Turnover 7.2 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, although spot transactions of public bonds opened in multiple varieties, the trading volume remained scarce. Futures were slightly more active than the previous day, with a turnover of 3.7 million in the morning and 3.5 million in the afternoon. Opening prices in the morning all rebounded slightly, and then fluctuated gradually upward. Throughout the day, only troop reduction futures fluctuated by about one yuan, while other bonds fluctuated only by four or five jiao. Compared with the previous day, only the 19-roll bonds slightly decreased, with demobilization spot bonds falling by six or seven jiao. Other bonds, however, rebounded by three or four jiao to about one yuan. The total spot transactions for the day amounted to 17,000 yuan, and futures transactions totaled 7.2 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Rampant Decline in Yarn, Cotton and Yarn Markets</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, with a sharp decline. The main reason is the daily rise in silver prices and the lack of downstream movement in the overseas cotton yarn situation.  Actual sales are sluggish, leading to a larger and larger accumulation of inventory.  Panic has arisen in the market.  Most bulls see the overall trend as unfavorable and have no choice but to painfully cut their losses, resulting in violent fluctuations in the market. However, a certain large merchant is still buying to increase positions, providing strong support.  In short, from a fundamental point of view, demand is the most important factor. Prices for all months have broken through the 65 tael line. The speed of the recent decline is particularly alarming. It is reported that prices have fallen by 15 taels in five days. The magnitude of today's (geng) fluctuations is rare in history.</p>
<p>▲ Distant Futures Plunge Nearly Five Taels</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures market, market sentiment was very weak due to the sharp rise in silver prices, resulting in scattered interest and a lack of buyers. The market was weak, with prices falling by one tael to one tael and five, six, or seven qian. In the afternoon, news that the gold price had broken the 700 tael mark caused extreme fear among buyers.  Sellers rushed in, causing prices to plunge across the board, with various declines ranging from two taels and eight qian to three taels and fourteen qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 52,100 bales. Checks reveal that 1,200 bales were sold by Mingde, 1,050 bales by Jiaxing, 1,450 bales by Yichang, 2,350 bales by Fuhe, and 2,200 bales by Changfeng. Muji bought 2,000 bales, Yuda 1,000 bales, Ruid 2,850 bales, Senkang 1,500 bales, Shenji 1,800 bales, and Xincheng 2,050 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>August　16.34911, Down 1.000</p>
<p>▲ Spot Sales Extremely Minimal</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that only 255 bales were bought by various locations throughout the day. 225 bales were taken up by counterparts, 100 bales were bought by inland merchants, 51 bales by Xuzhou, 5 bales by Northern merchants, 40 bales by Nanyang, 25 bales by Guangdong, 20 bales by Jiangxi, 5 bales by Xiamen, and 5 bales by Qinhuangdao.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Plummets Two Taels This Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, with a sharp decline. This is due to the sharp rise in silver prices and the falling gold market, which has dampened market sentiment. Buyers are eager to sell off. Imported cotton is seeing some activity due to exchange rate opportunities, and various factories are gradually buying Indian cotton. In the afternoon, news that the gold price had broken the 700 tael mark further frightened the bulls. The situation of imported cotton is weak, and the fundamentals of local cotton are becoming increasingly shaky due to various pressures. Therefore, local cotton prices have plummeted by one tael this month.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Futures Extremely Weak</p>
<p>At the opening of the Hankou futures market, selling pressure intensified due to the sharp fall in gold prices, with prices falling by two and a half qian to six or seven qian for various months. In the afternoon, news that the gold price was continuing to fall, reaching a low of 682 taels, resulted in only selling on the market. Many bulls closed out their positions, causing prices to fall by one, two, three, and eight qian. The price for the current month has already fallen to the limit of two taels, and the closing situation is weak, with trading not taking place. The total transaction volume for the day was 132,200 dan. Checks reveal that Shenchang sold 6,500 dan, Jifeng 2,900 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Changfeng 3,200 dan, Deji 4,400 dan, and Xinheng 3,200 dan. Gengfeng bought 6,000 dan, Taichang 3,800 dan, Hengde 3,000 dan, Shenda 2,700 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Yicheng 2,500 dan, and Yuda 3,100 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>July 39.50180, Down 1.622, 00</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Sales Active</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are gradually picking up due to the loosening of foreign exchange. Sources include 500 bales of Tonghua cotton, 1,200 bales of Yaohua cotton, and the Berar (Badans) area adding 3,930 Robbies. Wing On Factory purchased 6,000 pieces of Shaanxi cotton shipped in April/May at 42.00. Wing On Factory also purchased 1,200 pieces of spot Shaanxi cotton delivered to the factory at 42.00. Taifeng Factory purchased 1,200 pieces of spot Shaanxi cotton delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Continue to Move Downstream</h3>
<p>American Cotton Sellers Apply High Pressure</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, and many positions needed to be closed out. Sellers applied pressure, causing prices to fall. Futures fell by 6 to 11 points, spot goods fell by 10 points. English cotton fell by 11 points, spot goods fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 19 points. Indian cotton trading was sluggish, and market conditions showed no improvement. Pingle fell by 1 Robbie, forward contracts were unchanged. Omra and Berar Creek saw no changes in either near or forward terms. The original telegraphic report is recorded on the left (10th telegraph). American cotton compared to the previous day meets the Shanghai standard, English cotton compared to the previous day meets the Shanghai standard.</p>

<h3>Grain Prices Rising Steadily in the River Port Rice Market</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of arriving boats was still scarce, and sales continued to be good. Northern Jiangsu white rice saw some transactions for hoarding. Therefore, market prices rose by another corner. However, the market situation in the afternoon was weak, and buyers' intentions turned weak, so the situation gradually stabilized. Thin sales were active, pushing up prices by a corner. Yangxian and Duxian rice had different paths, with prices rising by a foot or so. Secondary rises were close to a foot. Tongbian rice arrived and sales were flat. Large quantities were slightly firm by half a corner.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from the interior. Sales in this street remained smooth. Changshu and other white rice also continued to rise by two corners due to hoarding. However, once the appetite is satisfied, the market will inevitably decline, so merchants were quite willing to sell. The situation of Southern Jiangsu thin rice and early rice gradually shifted from firm to stable. Prices had risen by a corner. Yang Dujian rice market appetite turned weak. In the early morning, prices rose by more than a corner, but the afternoon immediately presented a stable picture. Baiyuan sales were still acceptable. High-quality rice for winemaking purposes was selling well, and prices were seen to rise by about a corner.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a consistent and drastic decline in prices for all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Overseas wheat quotations had already fallen back by a small corner, and the bearish sentiment in the gold market had also weakened significantly. Coupled with favorable weather, the sentiment of all parties was shifted. The total turnover of the exchange had already reached over 11 million bags. Seventy or eighty percent of this amount was from factories. With such a large amount of goods, demand outside of the industry is certainly temporary and not sustainable. At that time, news also spread that factories were continuing to fix prices for overseas wheat. One report mentioned 4 taels and 0.04, and two reports mentioned only 4 taels. Therefore, both the upper and lower markets continued to dump heavily, with amounts of over 50. The total transaction volume for the day reached around 1.4 million. Therefore, market sentiment gradually declined, with no turning back. Looking at the situation after this, if the exchange rate were to rise again, it would still be expected to continue to fall. As a result, the current month fell by one and a half fen compared to the previous day, April/May fell by two fen and seven and a half li, and June/July/August fell by two fen and two li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a weakening trend in all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Overseas wheat quotations were slightly lower, and the weather was good. The overall market sentiment had been invisibly softened by the environment. However, many bulls who had profited were eager to cover their positions at this low price, so the temporary shorts were quite active and could still hold on. Therefore, although the overall trend was bearish, the extent of the decline was not significant. According to recent trends, if the number of chips in each month continues to increase, it is deeply feared that the tragic oversupply situation abroad will be seen in this port. As a result, the current month was down by a small two fen compared to the previous day, April was down by a small three fen, May/June were down by a small four fen, July was down by a small five fen, and August was down by a small four fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar Continues to Fall Without End</h3>
<p>▲ Affected by the Continuous Rise of the Dutch Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Yesterday, telegrams from sugar production areas reported that Cuban spot prices rose slightly by 0.0625 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures rose by one point in March, two points in May, and there was no change in September and December. There were no telegrams from the Javanese sugar market. The association's market was sluggish. No. 24 Dutch sugar was selling at ten taels and four qian. Due to the continuous rise in the Dutch exchange rate, market sentiment was even weaker, and buyers were absent. Although sellers loosened prices to ten taels and four qian, there were no buyers. Medium sugar and white sugar were also rarely inquired about. Daily sugar imports and exports were also quiet. N Mark was at ten taels and four qian, YT Mark was at ten taels and three qian, YRO Mark was at ten taels and 0.05 qian, YP Mark was at ten taels and 0.5 qian, and TM Mark was at ten taels and one and a half qian. Transactions were sluggish and the market shape was still weak. Although Taikoo B Mark for April/May delivery had been telegraphed about, there had been no response to date.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Daylily Sales Stagnant and Turning Downward</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of daylilies have been sluggish, and market prices have turned downwards. Even the Guangbang daylilies, which have the largest sales volume, have only seen sporadic transactions recently. The sales channels for other categories are even narrower, so market prices have gradually declined. Yesterday, top-grade daylilies were sold for twenty-five taels, Daxing daylilies were sold for twenty-three taels to twenty-two and a half taels, followed by twenty-one and a half taels to nineteen taels, and the lowest grade was sixteen taels. The trend is flat and weak. Without smooth sales, it is feared that there will be no turning point.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factories Telegraph Price Increases</h3>
<p>▲ Pity the Rising Exchange Rate... Inevitably Somewhat Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port turned upwards. Prices of Chinese silk had reportedly risen in the European and American markets, and yellow and white factory owners telegraphed price increases. Unfortunately, the exchange rate was rising, and the Chinese and Huayin banks were still nominally rising but secretly weakening. Yesterday, Xinfu and others imported 50 packages of Japanese silk into Shanghai, and Kaili and others imported 40 packages of Sichuan yellow silk, but prices remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Changtu Quotations Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>▲ High-Quality Goods Have Reached One Hundred and Seventy-Five Taels</p>
<p>Recently, although sales of yellow and white Changtu to Europe are not smooth, the inventory of high-quality goods in Shanghai is insufficient, and prices are still expected to rise. In addition, the exchange rate is rising. Yesterday, Xinfu and others imported 80 dan of Sichuan Changtu, and the market became even more lively. The price of high-quality goods has risen to one hundred and seventy-five taels.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Zhenmei English Sales Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were sporadic sales of Wuyuan high-grade Zhenmei green tea to English firms such as Jinjiang, Baochang, Xiehe, and Tianxiang. The Russian Cooperative Association has also resumed operations for Tunxi Wudong goods. The selling prices at the opening market were over seventy taels to one hundred taels for high-grade goods, and fifty to sixty taels for medium-grade goods, two or three taels lower than before. There was still some scattered demand for Zhenmei and Xiumei from the Baitou firms, but inventory was scarce and there were no large transactions. There was no market for other goods such as Xizhu tea.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Piece Goods Market Under the Plummeting Gold Market</h3>
<p>▲ Opening Prices Decreasing... Actual Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>The piece goods market has been increasingly depressed lately due to the impact of the plummeting gold market. Market sentiment is very weak, and the sluggishness of actual sales is unprecedented in recent times. Only Western goods can still hold steady, as inventory is not high and future sources are still far away. Therefore, those holding goods still have high hopes. Bleached cloth has not fallen at all, and striped fine twill has risen instead, requiring three qian. Plain silk pongee for clothing has reached around five qian. Eastern goods are showing signs of collapse. Yesterday, only Damo white thick flannel was still at three qian and one fen, and Children's Joy crepe wool was at three qian and two and a half fen. The market is still firm. Everything else is falling. Yuanyang yarn is down a small two and a half qian, Dianqiuxiang is opening at eleven taels, Hanshan Temple is at ten taels and nine qian, Trumpet Beauty is at ten taels and five and a half qian, and Zhigong ne is also softening. Only Chongsu silk pongee has not seen a decline. Qingdao merchants have a strong need and purchased Kefaza blue at four taels and eight qian and Lunchang goods at four taels and six and a half qian. But as of yesterday, inventories were running low, presenting a barren scene. Cotton flannel, Zhongshan ne, fine broadcloth, and printed Zhigong ne have all slightly fallen. Observing the future market, if gold prices continue to fall, the piece goods market will also be difficult to improve.</p>
<h3>Metal and Hardware: English Steel Plate Prices Plummet Sharply</h3>
<p>The metal hardware trade has become increasingly sluggish since the extension of foreign exchange terms. Sellers are feeling panicked and are increasingly eager to sell, which makes buyers even more reluctant to take action. Standard iron, because it is being manipulated, seems increasingly weak. Yesterday, the prices of English steel plates plummeted sharply, reaching a level of more than two liang. 2.5mm plates sold for 9 taels 2.5 qian, 5mm plates sold for 7 taels 3 qian, 7.5mm plates sold for 6 taels 7.5 qian, and 10mm plates sold for 6 taels 4.5 qian. Compared to the red board prices, the market has loosened by six or seven qian to one liang one and a half qian. It is reported that, apart from the Tianjin merchants and local factories adding some orders, there were no other transactions. Observing the scattered market sentiment, it is feared that prices will fall again tomorrow. French-style nails and tinplate, etc., are still able to maintain their prices due to the depletion of market inventory. All other items, such as galvanized iron, galvanized iron sheets, new lead wire, and chimney iron, are falling. It is reported that overseas pricing has increased, probably due to the rising exchange rate. In general, industry insiders are actively placing orders to prevent price increases. Therefore, overseas purchases in the last two days can be said to be very prosperous.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's War Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>(Continued from the Battle of Yser)</p>
<p>Later, we learned that part of this line passed through a levee that was three and a half to four and a half feet above the flat ground. Why didn't we implement the successful flooding plan around Dunkirk on the banks of the Yser River?</p>
<p>If this plan could be implemented, the two to three miles of land between the river and the railway would not be entrusted to the enemy. Moreover, the water flowing to the levee would be sufficient to defend the soldiers. In any case, in a retreat under heavy artillery fire, when morale is in chaos, the most important thing is to have a continuous line of communication for the soldiers to regroup and reorganize. Soldiers are willing to obey orders if they are slightly advantaged by the terrain. After the flooding plan is completed, the railway can provide such help.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I left Furnes on the evening of the 24th, I agreed with the Belgian General Staff to stop the retreat and deploy along the railway line, and agreed with the Belgian General Staff that although the seawater damage to this beautiful landscape could not be recovered in a short time, the flooding plan must be implemented.</p>
<p>As for General Grossetti, he sent me the following firm telegram from the Poperinge headquarters: "I don't know how many people in the 42nd Division will survive tomorrow, but as long as there is one soldier left, I swear not to let the German army cross the railway half a step."</p>
<p>We were about to fight again with exhausted troops. This operation was along the Nieuport-Diksmuide line. The French detachment was deployed at both ends, and Grossetti's troops held the center at Poperinge, greatly strengthening the defense line. In front, flooding was increased for defense, and the Nieuport sluice was heavily guarded. The question now was how long it would take for the flood to spread and how much area it would cover. No answer could be found in past experience, because this water defense plan was to let seawater flow to the coast to help defend. This point was never determined. The same effect occurred in the entire defense line.</p>
<p>On the 25th, Belgian troops lined up along the levee. On the 26th, the German artillery bombarded again, and the shells fell directly on the railway line. The defending forces felt precarious again, but they still trusted the rising seawater as their savior. On the evening of the 25th, the Belgian General Staff reported to Navy Commander Ronaud of Diksmuide: "Flooding the area between Diksmuide, Nieuport and the Yser River on the left bank of the Yser River." All arrangements were properly made, and special measures should be taken to prevent the spread of water to our troops. All culverts under the tracks must be blocked, and some canal banks must be dug open to allow seawater to flow in continuously.</p>
<p>Until the evening of the 27th, this type of work was completed. The Nieuport sluice was opened at high tide and closed at low tide. This was the routine every day thereafter. On the 28th, seawater flowed to the railway line near Beveren and continued to spread south, but the enemy's advance did not stop because of this, and their plans did not change because of this. On the morning of the 29th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on the area around Raskapelle one after another, but they could not occupy the village. They gained a solid high ground. If they could hold this place and break through again, then the area behind the seawater flooding area would be entirely in their hands. The railway levee would not be guaranteed, and even our entire defense plan would be overturned. Therefore, in any case, we had to recapture Raskapelle. General Grossetti immediately saw this point and ordered a counterattack from Zaiaveschel and Zonnebeke in conjunction with the Belgian army, and recovered the village before dusk.</p>
<p>The next day, the 31st, the entire defense was redeployed along the railway. The water in front of us became deeper and deeper. Except for a few places, the enemy had retreated across the Yser River. The sluice controlling the flooding plan was set up in Nieuport, which we guarded very firmly. At the other end of the railway, in Diksmuide, our Marines were also resisting stubbornly. From now on, the German army could not think of touching the area between these two places on the left bank of the Yser River. The road along the coast to Dunkirk and Calais was closed.</p>
<p>The battle lasted for ten days. The intensity of the German artillery fire was unprecedented. Their infantry was also very excited. Not counting their artillery, the enemy used the Third and Twenty-second Reserve Corps, a Wosz Division, and a Landwehr Brigade for this attack. Our combat troops were six Belgian divisions, our 42nd Division, and the Marines. The German army was completely defeated. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Life of a New York Professional Woman</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(I) New York: A Modern Mecca</p>
<p>New York, the world's only metropolis, boasts soaring skyscrapers that pierce the heavens, and deep tunnels that plunge into the earth's core. Tens of millions of ordinary people from every corner of the world converge here. New York is truly the grand gateway to the New World. Naturally, in such a place, every train arriving from near and far is bound to carry women filled with aspirations, determined to broaden their horizons and to triumph in this vortex of culture. This is hardly surprising. In New York City, these women often feel that life must be upward-striving and exceptionally brilliant. New York is a place for success and romance. In a city of this size, there are always new frontiers to conquer, new sights to see, and new friends to make.</p>
<p>New York is a haven for young people, and youth reigns supreme. Customs and traditions hardly exist as concepts. Weaklings find no pity in New York. Anyone unable to struggle in this great city is inevitably cast aside. Women consumed by longing and fervent ambition, women eager to surpass others, all sorts of people flock to New York, throwing their youth into that fiery crucible as a sacrifice. Consequently, many women willingly forget everything. In this astonishing city, they can control the ebb and flow of their own lives. Or perhaps they hope New York will give them the greatest gift of all: oblivion.</p>
<p>What's most astonishing about New York is that anything can happen. Modern novels abound with stories of women from humble backgrounds who rise to prominence in New York. Yet, countless tragic stories also exist. An old song paints a poignant picture of New York, saying, "Every light on Broadway is a heartbreak." When a woman achieves success in New York, others hear so much about her. Newspapers and magazines often publish these inspiring stories. Women living in small towns, upon reading these accounts, all want to try their luck in this vortex. As for the stories of women who fail, how they shed tears, how they endure hardship, those stories are seldom published. Audiences don't enjoy reading accounts of suffering unless there's a happy ending. Women who live their entire lives in small towns often never grasp the reality of New York. Whether they are sick or healthy, happy or in pain, no one knows or cares about them there. Therefore, life in New York is uniquely peculiar. Even for the most self-sufficient woman, it's difficult to lead a quick and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>For women who seek a living in New York, whether in business or socially, they encounter a completely new environment. Illusions eventually shatter. New York is by no means a paradise for idealists. Cleverness and worldliness can replace the dreams of youth. Women struggle with the world and only realize the taste and method of struggle when they seize life in New York. Telling women about the difficulties of finding work in New York might at least deter them from going. Every woman thinks, "I am different." "I was born with good fortune." Who dares say otherwise? A few women manage to skip over disappointment and discouragement, but this is an exception to the norm.</p>
<p>Many warnings emanate from Hollywood, urging women not to go lightly unless their finances can support them for two or three years. Consequently, beautiful and outstanding women no longer flock to the film sets like a tidal wave as in years past. New York will probably have to adopt a similar approach in the future. Of course, practically speaking, New York offers countless jobs for women to settle into. A position can always be found. To say to women, "Don't come to New York," seems unfair. It's better to let her stubbornly wait for the right opportunity. This means that young newcomers must have ample money to last at least a month.</p>
<p>Scientists may scoff at the so-called lucky ones in human affairs, but in the business world, we cannot escape the concept of the right timing and the right place. What else can we call it but luck? Some women find a position very fortunately upon arriving in New York. This is probably because they know how to find one. Finding a job in New York isn't easy, but there are several effective methods. Personal contacts are extremely helpful. A letter of introduction from a friend back home is also something a woman seeking work in New York shouldn't overlook.</p>
<p>If women lack access to professional channels, then newspaper classifieds and employment agencies are both good options to consider. Some New York newspapers have excellent classified sections. High-quality positions can often be found in newspapers. It's best not to respond to ads without a business name and address. Fortunately, New York newspapers are very careful and usually only publish ads from reputable businesses. However, caution is still necessary. A newcomer to New York carefully reads the morning paper, marking the ads for the positions she wants to apply for. She first pays attention to the best positions. However, it often takes a long time to get an interview after responding to an ad. Interviews are conducted on a first-come, first-served basis, so she has to get up early. If she waits all day and there's no result, then the position might already be filled. Some large stores don't interview job seekers until after noon.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of employment agencies in New York City. Some specialize in a particular industry, such as secretarial agencies, university graduate agencies, and teaching agencies. If a woman seeking a job has specialized knowledge, she should go to a specialized agency that matches her skills. Agencies often advertise in newspapers. The golden rule for finding a job is "early." Therefore, looking for work is synonymous with getting up early. Employment agencies often charge applicants a fee, which is permitted by law. In New York, if an agency secures an excellent position, it can charge the first week's salary as compensation. This fee is not paid in installments. If the position is temporary, then 10% commission is sufficient. Women can save these fees if they find a position on their own.</p>
<p>Large department stores, banks, insurance companies, and hotels in New York all have their own employment departments. Letters of application must be neat and coherent, and one shouldn't be timid. Finally, when it comes to finding a position, young women must resolve to stand on their own feet in the world. New York, the modern Mecca, extends its huge arms to welcome the youth of the nation. It says to young women, "Come to New York! But once there, don't expect to rely on anyone." Those who answer this call must forge ahead and establish their own foothold. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>An Appeal to My Fellow Women</h3>
<p>— Xie Bing</p>
<p>Dear Sisters, for thousands of years, Chinese women have been subjugated under feudal society. After that long period of oppression and constraint, we are now pitifully on the verge of collapse. Our fates are controlled by those in power. Not only do we lack freedom of body and will, but men are given the authority to decide our lives and deaths. Women live like prisoners shackled and confined in a jail.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, like a thunderclap, in the last thirty years, influenced by the natural law of physics, a phenomenon has emerged where the greater the pressure, the stronger the resistance. Thus, along with the surging and turbulent tide of political revolution, slogans such as "Freedom," "Equality," and "Suffrage" have been shouted. This cannot but be a preliminary celebration for our glorious future. However, in the raging tide of resistance and the unstable transitional period, truth is often obscured by the violent and deceptive haze of fog. As a result, we obtain "equality in name only" and "false equality," and then we believe we are satisfied, cheering and jumping, intoxicated and unaware of the future. Therefore, many sisters who have received higher education are still saying that the law is now equal, education is now equal, and opportunities are now equal. We no longer need to demand "liberation" and movements such as "suffrage." Alas, to speak while wearing tinted glasses is a terrible mistake. Even our own interests have not been clarified. How heartbreaking! No wonder that in recent years, the women of the whole country have been silent and have not uttered a word.</p>
<p>Dear Sisters, we have not yet obtained even a fraction of true liberation. My reason can be observed from both "social" and "political" aspects. First, in the social aspect, a large portion of our female compatriots are still shackled by the old ethics, living lives worse than beasts of burden.</p>
<p>There is another portion, women whose thoughts are not thorough, being lured by the flowery words of men into the cage of playthings without realizing it. It is countless. They often encounter men with a bit of false reputation and empty prestige, and they are driven by vanity, like moths flying into a flame, never realizing it until death. They only greedily pursue temporary material pleasure and love temporary false warmth, offering their sacred bodies to the devil to be slaughtered. They denounce concubinage with their mouths, but they themselves become someone else's concubine. How heartbreaking this is!</p>
<p>So, those who formerly seduced women suppressed women to the very bottom and treated them with fierce faces. At that time, because women were not awakened and had no ability to resist, it became a society that despised women. Now that women have become conscious and want to break free from cruel constraints, they have changed their approach, reversing their former oppression and using sweet warmth to lift them up to the ninth heaven, entrancing them, "The degree of despising women is still the same as before, but they have changed their methods," making them proud, making them willingly fall into their trap and lose their resistance. How ridiculous and pathetic this is!</p>
<p>The above two causes are the result of being influenced by a bad social and economic system. Second, in the political aspect, although we have obtained further status from the recently stipulated legal provisions, such as the recent order issued by the National Government to allow the National Assembly to be convened in May of this year, the election law of the National Assembly is limited to professional groups. On the government's side, it is thought that the people are not divided by gender, but the opening of professions and education in China is still shallow. Once women's service to society is compared with men, the difference is more than tens of millions of miles. According to this regulation, the result of the election in the future will definitely be a complete failure. This is an undoubtedly factual problem.</p>
<p>But there are those who do not understand the interests of our women, or say that women's participation in professional occupations is small, and women should bear the responsibility themselves. This statement seems correct on the surface, but upon closer examination, it is completely wrong. If we want to say that, then the women who were formerly oppressed by patriarchal society are also their own problem, and it has nothing to do with the political system. Why bother with revolution? Why did Sun Yat-sen stipulate in the party platform the development of women's rights? When women's abilities are insufficient and their feathers are not yet full, there must be considerable assistance before it can conform to Sun Yat-sen's teachings of national politics and national revolution. If you think my words are excessive, you might as well cite an example to prove it. If China were now to sign a reciprocal treaty on inland river navigation with the powers, on the surface it would seem grand and dignified, treating each other equally, but in reality, it has fallen into the trap of foreigners, suffering economic invasion without realizing it. What is the reason for this? Because foreign industries are developed and navigation is prevalent, while China's industries are backward and there is no talk of competition in navigation. At this moment, we have signed a reciprocal treaty, and the result is only to provide foreign ships as much as possible to pass through the four borders, while Chinese ships are not seen in the shadows of foreign coasts. China only bears the false name of reciprocity, and is unknowingly invaded. How much of a loss is this situation? It must be known that reciprocal treaties can only be established under conditions of equal strength. In addition to this, I will cite another example to clarify it. Suppose there is a strong person who says to a person who has been sick for a long time, "I have equal opportunities in clothing, food, and games. Why don't you get up and enjoy them?" But how can a patient who cannot walk forward and has difficulty swallowing food have the opportunity to enjoy everything, only making him sad? If this healthy person is sincere in treating him, he must help him, empathize with him, and let him recover his health before it is truly mutual aid.</p>
<p>Even today, on the surface, women and men have equal suffrage in China, but in terms of occupational units for elections, there are very few women with occupations. What method can he use to have the qualifications of a representative and the opportunity to appeal? It is as if our women today are similar to these two analogies. It can be said that the people of society are not sincere in helping us to truly liberate.</p>
<p>Dear Sisters, in this current situation, only we should strive to learn, seek unity, and work hard, because to be equal and mutually beneficial, we must first make ourselves the same height as them, and the situation of "false equality" will then be eliminated. Dear Sisters, strive and encourage yourselves.</p>
