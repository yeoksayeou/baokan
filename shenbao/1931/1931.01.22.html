<h3>外報紀救濟銀賤辦法</h3>
<p>美印兩國限制出售生銀</p>
<p>各國商定金銀一定比價</p>
<p>字林報云丶據十九日倫敦專電丶本報記者從消息靈通之金融家方面聆悉銀市慘跌原因丶據稱丶印度政府之售銀丶對於世界銀市影響丶比較尚輕丶其較爲重要之原因丶則由於一九二六年希爾敦楊格改革幣制報告公佈以來丶大宗銀羅比丶收入印度金庫丶蓋希氏建議在過渡時代先採甲虛金本位丶鈔票與羅比兼用丶嗣後逐漸鼓鎦金幣丶迨其計劃完全實施丶祇有金幣與鈔票可以無限制通用丶羅比銀幣完全降爲輔幣丶使用以五十枚爲限於是無數過剩羅比紛紛流爲生銀銷歸金庫丶丶遂成銀貨供過於求之現象丶至世界歷年產銀數量丶在近年以前丶大致無甚出入丶前年則爲二萬六千萬盎斯丶去年已縮爲二萬四千萬盎斯丶若銀價繼續下落丶今年產額丶或將再減惟銀之出產大宗爲副產品丶故欲减削產額丶勢頗不易丶若銀礦業仍照本身最有利益之辦法繼續採銀丶則印度政府自亦難禁其陸續出售過剩之存銀丶至最近銀價之慘跌丶由於中國方面出口貨不若進口貨之㕵盛丶需要金幣應付貨欵丶對於生銀絕少需要之所致云丶</p>
<p>字林報記者嗣唔金業經紀人某君丶叩以銀市意見丶渠於前電所述丶亦表同意丶據稱中國因施行新稅則丶故去年進口貨特別旺盛顧無相當出口貨以相抵補丶結果遂不得不在倫敦售銀以易金丶償付人超之貨價丶據倫敦某經紀行家佔計中國各銀行在倫敦拋售生銀丶約在三千萬至四千萬盎斯之間丶邇來銀市近期與遠期相差零三七五便士丶即爲此故丶但另一生銀經紀行家則頗懷疑此項估計之未免過鉅丶至中國出口貨之清淡丶則由於歐美商業凋疲丶减購華產丶實爲一大原因丶又據稱丶美國銀礦業自去年七月至十一月間丶其時銀價約在每盎斯一先令七便士左右丶因希冀銀價回漲計减少售額丶於維持市價上丶裨益不少丶今則屯積旣多丶又恐印度繼續售出丶將使銀價益跌丶正求設法脫售丶至印度政府在此銀價每盎斯十三便士之際丶是否準備再行售出亦一問題丶據某君意見丶倘美人脫售存貨丶則印度政府曷爲屯積不售丶自蒙損失丶故此事應先由美商向印政府接洽丶約定銀價跌至某項定價之下丶彼此停止不售丶惟銀價問題丶尚不僅如此簡單印度與美國雖有左右銀市之大力第限制出售丶尚非治本辦法丶必俟各國同意丶商定金銀一定比價後銀市始可安定丶惟此　於各國亦殊有利丶因歐洲各國往日以高價銷售銀幣今日可以低價購這丶重鑄輔幣丶一轉移間獲利不貲丶若此　果能實現丶則銀價之回漲丶要當爲日不遠矣丶</p>

<p>付之一笑　海客</p>
<p>七歲的女兒（在親戚家裏。聽伊的母親不斷的和親戚講話。厭倦極了。）丨母親。我們好回去了。</p>
<p>母丨你不要鬧。再等一會。</p>
<p>七歲的女兒丨母視。我們好回去了。</p>
<p>母丨孩子。你不知道禮貌麼。長輩在這裏說話。不可打岔。必須等我們說完了。你纔可說。</p>

<h3>翁文灝先生入川地質談</h3>
<p>李絜非</p>
<p>北平地質調青所所長翁文灝先生。頃自四川考查地質。歸過首都。中大地質系邀其講演。先生萬里長途。風塵滿面。行裝甫卸丶講壇斯登。其爲國爲學之精神。彌足稱也。（以下紀先生語）</p>
<p>行程余自宜昌入川丶沿江至重慶。北由合川入成都。歸循西途趨嘉定丶繞峨嵋山。越自流井。還重慶。遵原途出川焉。</p>
<p>盆地四川爲一盆地。人亦以此爲言。然實不當若斯之簡單。以其中有多數狹小之背斜層。隔而爲多數之盆地溯江而上。即見地層構造丶歷歷在前。其間向斜層多屬白堊紀。色紅而鬆。母能疊爲高山。背斜層則多屬侏羅紀丶不溶且堅。故乃形爲崇巖。再古則爲三疊紀·爲山亦較高。石灰紀則山乃愈高。昔日傳說四川地形甚新。乃屬皮相之言。實則構造與侵蝕之影響丶同具大力。今予對此。尚難即辨。然不能不存疑子前人之說也。</p>
<p>江行四川盆地。鄂西即見。予走馬看花。難獲要領。幸前此諸人。調查綦詳。子湖北西北。四川西南。不勞跋涉。使予但須倚臥輪舷。即有所得。彼勞我逸。尚感前賢。過宜昌。小山連綿數十里。成于石灰石丶當第三紀。曰宜昌峽。風景便佳。山高約七百公尺丶崇山峻嶺。束江爲半里腰。洋洋大觀。再內山平江闊。是曰秀麗之地形。上有一峽。曰牛肺馮肝峽。（石灰石溶成石鐘乳。色擬于牛肺馬肝。）峭立丶如宜昌峽。再上爲米倉峽。皆石灰石斜高所成。內有秭歸縣。屈大夫之故鄉也。此三峽乃稱歸州三峽。是雄壯之地形也。</p>
<p>巫峽再西曰巫山峽。雄偉逾前所遇。自千米達至千三百米達。高山懸崖。百二十里未嘗絕。江狹祗二百米達。峭壁之上。植物不生。昔人詩稱巫山十二峯。實則夾岸高山。千百成峯。不止十二也。</p>
<p>巫縣爲入川第一縣。逾一峽至瞿塘峽。前人但考查至此爲限。前有大石曰灧澦堆。石灰石落江中。尚不及蝕盡者。橫臥江中。舟行莫便。一入夔門。乃見夔府。（奉節）此地有重要礦產。鹽·石膏·油·煤氣·芒硝·其犖大者也。</p>
<p>鹽岩	凭欄下矚。鹽色可見。江水吸蒸。即凝成晶。每當夏季江水陡長之時。居人塞窪淤低。阻水歸東。秋盡木凋。水勢驟減則曩之所踏。今日盡成鹽田矣。</p>
<p>江轉夔府以內。江流突轉。與山脈成平行。故所見山層。幾于千篇一律。然淺平秀麗。亦自可觀。橫柯上蔽。奇葩斜掩。景境自與前異。至涪州。見與造峽同質之石灰石。地層突升·凡自宜昌至重慶。其問宜昌·南沱·歸州·巫峽·巫山·瞿塘·皆背斜層·窄而險。涪州則爲向斜層。闊而平舖者也。</p>
<h3>氷湖紀趣</h3>
<p>荊夢蝶</p>
<p>太湖三萬六千頃。水勢汪洋。爲東南巨浸。然前日雪後。居然凍合。一片玻璃。如大圓鏡。平置天際。奇景也。今天晴數日矣。值友人有來自梅園者。告我以湖氷猶未解。蓋其厚處凍至七八寸。故不易消融。於是湖上情形。有足述已。</p>
<p>湖中水產物。魚蝦甚富丶濱湖一帶。自梅園之太湖飯店。以迄榮巷等處菜館。悉取給焉。湖面旣氷。漁人不得下網。則魚暇之來源斷絕。雖出重價。亦無所得。一般老饕。舉箸時均起無魚之歎。荷荷不已。然水族之生命。則保全不少也。</p>
<p>白鷗埜鳧。結隊成羣。自由出沒。平時以水爲家。湖上何可勝數。今則有家難歸。且無所得食。因隔堅氷。水中物無由探取也。一餓幾日。瘦影伶仃。散棲氷上。奄奄待斃丶乃大爲弋人所利。童子多往捕之。如探囊取物耳。有鴛鴦兩對。得者售諸梅園。園中司事余友吳君以法養之。用爲陳列品。雙雙情侶。溫柔鄉雖驚寒而破。然易地新居。依然同命。以視夫鷗鳧之所遭。爲幸多矣。</p>
<p>太湖界吳越之間。水路交通。向居衝要。今則航行停頓。最大之錫湖輪船凍滯湖中丶即其餘小輪班船。亦概不開駛。商賈行旅。大感不便。然湖中積匪甚多。水泊生涯。特小舟爲利器。聞亦以氷故。致妨工作。大抵守巢坐食。刦掠之風。頓告平息。於時沿湖居民。轉得有圍爐安枕之樂。是則受氷天雪地之賜。不暇作苦寒吟已。</p>
<h3>王少樓新片小評</h3>
<p>石僧</p>
<p>王少樓北歸後。京滬人士對此後起英才。不無惜別之感。適值大中華唱片公司。新出少樓佳片五張。余特自得勝公司購歸。一聆雅音。喜其精妙。紀述於後。以告嗜少樓曲者。</p>
<p>五片以戰太平爲最佳。﹁別家﹂一段西皮搖板。﹁大砲﹂二字。使一嘠調。﹁一嚮﹂及﹁震天地﹂二腔。均用娃娃調。響遏行雲。收音術清朗而不炸烈。異常警闢。﹁地﹂字之虛音。響亮而圓轉如意。余派之特長也。﹁呌花安與爲父帶坐騎﹂句。再使高調。綽有餘裕。﹁大夫人請上受一禮﹂句之哭腔。哀婉動人。此段深合悲壯二字之意。與老譚之西皮。叔十之二簧。先後輝映。今之鬚生能有此聲口者。確不易覯也。二段鬧帳之流水搖板哭腔。足當簡潔蒼勁四字之評。四郎探母之﹁未開言﹂一段。灌過者固不乏人。當以羅小寳爲最佳。惟缺少﹁我本是楊四郎﹂二名搖板。未免美中不足。少樓此劇。名滿平津京滬。此段尤稱快心快意。且成全豹。未有遺珠之憾。故有足多。二段係被擒見弟全詞。﹁大喝一聲···﹂之高唱入雲。兩段快板之字字珠璣。﹁弟兄們分別﹂一段之拖宕潔勁。韻味盎然。法塲換子自經叔岩菊朋提倡之後。一時風行南北。菊朋有反二簧三眼一段頗佳。少樓今特賡續於後。自﹁因此上薛門中···﹂之反二簧原板唱起。此句波騰浪湧。聲勢非常雄壯。﹁在洋河﹂句之緩瀉紆迴。別饒奇觀。﹁馬夫人我不便攙你···﹂句之反二簧搖板。抑控如旨。﹁單等那大砲響···﹂悲愴絕倫。寳蓮燈﹁我本當﹂一段與家絃戶誦之﹁昔日裏﹂緊相銜接。中有二處哭腔。別緻新頴。爲其他二簧原板所無者。法門寺之﹁郿塢縣﹂。菊朋有此。而缺末一句。連良非大路玩藝。詞腔殊覺抝異。少樓此段。腔新味醕。全段未嘗缺殘。益投嗜片者所好。二六之佳腔迭出。亦一異彩也。捉放宿店二簧慢板之尺寸。宜於徐緩。少樓此劇。富有曲情。佳可知矣。五片並皆精妙。少樓弱冠。有此造詣。足以自豪也。</p>
<h3>巴黎物語（十）</h3>
<p>六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>㈠一位阿眞丁的朋友</p>
<p>一個阿眞丁的朋友﹂ＵｎａｍｉｄＡｇｅｎｔｉｎｅ這是通俗喜劇名手老倍爾拉丶TｒｉｓｔａｎＢｅｒｎａｒｄｏ他的兒子ＪｅａｎｊａｃｑｕｅｓＢｅｒｎａｒｄ也是法國現在狠有名的劇作家）和莫Ｍａｘ．Ｍｌａｕｒｅｙ合編的一齣四幕喜劇。老倍爾拉的作品差不多全是現代社會最精確的寫照。他對於人情的觀察深刻到極點。臺詞輕快而多含譏謔。他駡了人而還要使得人笑。他的作品因爲合着人人口味的緣故。號召力極大。每次上演必售滿座。﹁阿眞丁明友﹂雖說是和莫雷合作的。但倍爾拉氏的作風却還儘量保存着。劇情離奇變幻。經過許多曲折而卒歸到一個完美的收塲。這是現在巴黎流行的通俗喜劇的一個共同點。</p>
<p>看罷。這便是喜劇﹁阿眞丁朋友﹂的本事。一個呌作勒萬諾的鰥夫和他的女兒雅萊同住着。勒諾算得一個慈愛的父親。但他的壞處是喜歡出入跑馬塲和俱樂部。他遠不及他的女兒敏活而富於堅强的意志。雅萊和伊的表兄一個呌作加士豋的庸懦的男子互相愛悅。當兩家親長齊集在勒諾家中來决定雅萊和加士豋的婚期時。加士豋的母親因聽說交易所的某種股票市價降落不已。勒諾有破產之虞。對於雅萊和加士豋的婚期的决定忽表示異議。主張加士登先往美國一避。待其歸來再行婚禮。加士豋雖不願。但不敢違抗母命。飲泣而已。</p>
<p>不久勒諾果然破產。和雅萊遷居一小屋中。窮困萬狀。但他好頑的習慣還一點不改。幸雅萊狠有勇氣。伊在一家銀行找到了一個位置。自己節衣縮食把錢省下來送給他父親去揮霍。伊覺悟在伊現在那種境況底下决不能夠和伊親愛的表兄結婚。這時伊的姑母又正在找機會想要破壞雅萊和伊兒子的婚事。雅萊因服從命運。自願退約。伊假說不再愛伊的表兄了。等到加士豋跑來責備伊時。她當面告訴他不願再和他結婚。其實伊心裡狠苦。</p>
<p>一個星明天的上午。當勒諾行跑馬塲去了時。雅萊在家忽然有一個不認識客人來訪問丶這是一個老天文學者新從南美阿眞丁共和國歸來的。他在那裡做過富翁普羅巴創立的天文台台長。</p>

After discussion, it was considered that the reasons were insufficient, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs was still instructed to complete it by the end of April of this year. The meeting adjourned at 11 o'clock. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Nanjing Gong Bingfan, commander of the 28th Division, telegraphed Beijing, stating that after our troops captured Donggu, the 18th and 19th regiments immediately stationed in Taihe. Later, when they heard that the 18th Division had suffered a defeat, they led their troops to support them. However, due to strategic considerations, they had to hold Donggu. Commander Lu also believed that a major encirclement and suppression required a change of plan, so he ordered our troops to temporarily return to Fuyong and consolidate Ji'an, and wait for the army to gather before launching a general attack to cooperate in the suppression and wipe them out in one fell swoop.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Statement of the Japanese Seiyukai</h3>
<p>The physical wounds suffered by Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi have now healed and he has been discharged from the hospital safely. However, an invisible political bullet is about to be added to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's body. The statement issued by the Seiyukai at today's general meeting is the first bullet of those who oppose the government. After the Japanese Diet opens, the political war will begin. I know that it is not only the Seiyukai that wants to add bullets to the Hamaguchi Cabinet. The bullet fired by the Seiyukai today is particularly powerful. Looking at the speech delivered by President Inukai in the assembly hall and the statement passed by the party, there is courage to do one's best to pounce, and the determination that the cabinet will not fall until it falls. Moreover, the crimes listed by Hamaguchi are particularly appealing to the opposition parties and the general public who oppose the government. For example, the lifting of the gold embargo and the tightening of the economy have led to the depression of the financial world, and the high-profile non-oligarchic debt and tax reduction have failed. The fact that Kijuro Shidehara attended the meeting as acting prime minister is not clear about the great righteousness of constitutionalism. These are all the most violent ammunition for impeaching the government, and they are well prepared and have been accumulating for a long time. The government party, the Minseito, although it also knew that this bullet would inevitably be unavoidable, has already opened a meeting to plan how to deal with it and has decided on a combat strategy. On the surface, it is showing calmness, but it cannot avoid a panicked look. Today is the first day of the meeting after the Japanese Diet's vacation, and it is also the first day of the two sides' fierce fight. After Hamaguchi is hit by the Seiyukai, it may be like the previous assassin's physical wounds, which were fortunately removed from danger in a few days, or it may be unfortunate and even more embarrassing. The relationship between good and bad is very important. How can we predict it today?</p>

<h3>British Parliament Reopens</h3>
<p>Boxer Indemnity Allocation Bill Passes Second Reading</p>
<p>Liberal Party's Rejection Motion Defeated</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - The House of Commons reopened today with a large attendance of members, especially from the Conservative Party, due to a notice from the party leader requiring attendance. The second reading of the Boxer Indemnity allocation bill has passed. The indemnity will be allocated as follows: £265,000 to Hong Kong University for the education of Chinese students; £200,000 to the Universities China Committee in London; the remainder to be controlled by the Chinese Government. When moving the second reading, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dalton stated that the bill was a major step in which China and Britain would mutually benefit, (1) enabling China to increase educational opportunities; (2) enabling China to increase trade prosperity by helping China create a large transportation system commensurate with its natural resources and its new state; (3) enabling China to increase its purchasing power and productivity. Thus, the Chinese market would increase in value and benefit British trade; (4) enabling important British industries and machinery businesses to employ more workers. Conservative MP Lampson said he hoped the House understood the significant contribution the bill would make to China. He believed the bill should require regular British representation on the management committee overseeing part of the indemnity. Liberal MP Lambert moved to reject the bill, stating that he believed the British government was taking a very slow path in its pursuit of education in China, whereas the US government had already dealt with the indemnity, but in a very different way. The bill would tarnish Britain's reputation in China because it was adding another 5% to education. He was not opposed to its benefits but opposed its hypocrisy. Conservative MP Eden stated that the bill was based on the committee's report, which included Chinese representatives among those who prepared the report. Minister of Labor Graham stated that the purpose of the bill was to strengthen the friendship between the two countries in a practical way and to connect educational facilities with railway development. The British government was aware that the Washington Treaty did not prohibit China from finding ways to purchase railway materials in Britain. He was certain that the purchasing committee would be able to monitor prices and ensure China was fully protected. Regarding China's debts to British railway companies, the Chinese Foreign Minister had stated to the British Foreign Secretary last year that the procedure for sorting out the railways would include a clause on clearing railway debts as soon as possible. The motion to reject the bill was defeated.</p>
<h3>European Union Conference Decides to Invite Russia and Turkey to Participate</h3>
<p>Opposition from Representatives of Britain, Norway, Holland, and Belgium is Ineffective</p>
<p>New Problems Arise with Danzig's Participation in Economic Discussions</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th (Guomin News Agency) - This afternoon, the European Federal Council's Committee on Consideration deliberated the issue of inviting non-member states. After a heated public debate, they finally passed the shareholders' committee's compromise method and formally invited Turkey, Russia, and Iceland to participate in the European Federal Conference in May. During the debate, the focus was largely on Soviet Russia. The Norwegian Foreign Minister strongly argued that the timing for inviting Soviet Russia was not yet ripe, requesting an additional amendment, which was supported by Britain, Belgium, Spain, Holland, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia, but ultimately rejected by the assembly. After this contentious issue was temporarily resolved, the meeting continued to discuss the economic report of the former Dutch Finance Minister Colijn. The Romanian representative Titulescu spoke first, proposing the organization of an International Agricultural Loan Bank and a grain price stabilization fund for the Danube countries. German Foreign Minister Curtius then took the floor, welcoming Colijn's frank remarks, stating that Germany had special circumstances that necessitated reducing imports and increasing exports in order to pay reparations. Apart from this, Germany was prepared to make all possible concessions and join all necessary negotiations in order to save the decline of the European economy, requesting that all countries discuss the current situation with a thorough, impartial, and fair attitude, otherwise it would be difficult to achieve unanimous cooperation.</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th (Guomin News Agency) - The European Union's Committee of Consideration completed its economic discussions today. It delegated the foreign ministers of eight countries, including Britain, France, Italy, Poland, and Germany, to form a shareholders' committee to draft a report. The German Foreign Minister proposed that the Free City of Danzig be invited to participate in the meeting. The Polish Foreign Minister strongly opposed, stating that Danzig's diplomacy was under Polish control. However, the German Foreign Minister insisted on his proposal. Finally, Chairman Briand decided that this matter would be raised for discussion at the next committee meeting later this week.</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Declaration</h3>
<p>Enumerates Current Cabinet's Maladministration</p>
<p>Takes on the Responsibility of Saving the Country and the People</p>
<p>Parliament Reopens Today</p>
<p>Hamaguchi Recovered and Discharged from Hospital</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Dentsu) - The Seiyukai Convention convened at 1 PM today. President Inukai ascended the platform amid applause and vehemently exposed the current cabinet's maladministration, encouraging the party to unite and declare war on the government in parliament. Subsequently, the following declaration was passed: "At this critical juncture, at a crossroads where the nation either rises or falls, this is Japan's current situation. The current cabinet, with its weak foreign policy, has damaged the nation's prestige abroad and has created a multitude of maladministration domestically. Nothing is more difficult for the nation than today's situation. If this is not eliminated, it will inevitably leave behind future troubles. Furthermore, the current cabinet, at the time of its formation, unveiled the so-called Ten Major Policies, but in the year and a half since then, none have been implemented. With extreme consumption austerity, it has caused the nation's industries to decline daily. Even the tax reduction that it has promoted as a result of military downsizing is only lip service, and the national burden has not been reduced. Moreover, the revenue estimates in the budget proposal are grossly exaggerated, jeopardizing the foundation of the national finances. While boasting of austerity, the relief law and other important policies have not been implemented, merely clinging to power. While we deeply sympathize with Prime Minister Hamaguchi's misfortune, having a non-party member, Foreign Minister Shidehara, act as prime minister is incomprehensible to the great meaning of constitutional government and reverses party politics. Our party must, based on its established policies and with a spirit of proactive advancement, save the country and the people. Even though we are a minority party, we must expose the government's maladministration in this parliament and appeal to the people for what is right and wrong."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Dentsu) - Prime Minister Hamaguchi has fully recovered from his injuries and was discharged from the Teidai Hospital at noon today, sixty-nine days since his admission due to the assassination attempt.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Dentsu) - Parliament, after the expiration of the adjournment, will begin a heated political battle starting tomorrow. The House of Peers is scheduled to convene at 10 AM and will first have Vice President Prince Konoe deliver an address on behalf of the Upper House to express sympathy for Prime Minister Hamaguchi's assassination. This will be followed by a policy address by Prime Minister Shidehara and a foreign policy address by the Foreign Minister. From there, the questioning will begin, with Minister Ikeda immediately raising the issue of the acting Prime Minister in an emergency interpellation. The House of Representatives is also scheduled to convene at 1 PM. The Seiyukai may raise an emergency interpellation on the issue of the acting Prime Minister before the policy address. If the request is rejected, chaos is likely to occur on the floor. However, many of the Seiyukai's leaders oppose such tactics, so it is difficult to predict what attitude the Seiyukai will take.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Japan United Press) - The party affiliations of the current members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives are listed below: "House of Peers": Imperial Faction: 17; Kenkyukai: 150; Koseikai: 68; Koyu Club: 41; Dowakai: 36; Doseikai: 27; Kayokai: 26; Purely unaffiliated: 36; Total: 401. "House of Representatives": Minseito: 267; Seiyukai: 172; First Control Room: 18; Including National Unity: 7; Proletarian: 5; New: 2; Unaffiliated: 4; Total: 460 (6 vacancies).</p>
<h3>Churchill Criticizes Current Government's Indian Policy</h3>
<p>Says Closing Remarks at Indian Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Do Not Represent the Views of a Large Part of the British People</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Issues Statement Refuting</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - Former Governor of British Punjab, Watuyu, delivered a fierce speech today in Reddinghan on the Indian Round Table Conference, saying that the convocation of this meeting was to divide the skin of a dying British lion. The meeting was very important because it showed that the current government was willing to abandon British rule and responsibility in India. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill said in today's brief that the fluent and well-intentioned speech at the close of the Indian Round Table Conference did not represent the views of a large part of the British people. In his view, outsiders will think that the British are eager to end their relationship with India as soon as possible. He did not believe the British really meant this. If so, then the era of Britain's power and prestige in the world will never return. Britain did not explain its position in detail at this meeting. The true meaning of all the conditions for protection were not mentioned. If the conditions for protection are truly accurate and effective, then the status of autonomy and responsible government are not appropriate for the proposed constitution. But it is not too late. When the next meeting is convened in India or Britain, the British people must know their position and must have the courage and wisdom to tell the truth to India.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - British Prime Minister MacDonald issued his remarks on the Indian Round Table Conference today via radio, refuting the notion that this conference was a sign of British weakness towards India and was convened because of Indian disturbances, saying the Indian disturbances were not the motive for convening the conference, but an obstacle to convening the conference. For fifty years, Britain had declared to India that the main purpose of the British in India was to gradually grant India autonomy. If Britain now changes its policy that is appropriate to reason and justice because of obstructive and unreasonable actions, then the result will be an increase in acts of rebellion. The conference is now closer to a kind of agreement than most people expected. Those who formulate the new constitution will protect all ethnic groups, and non-infringible rights must be announced on other days. The new Indian Governor will arrive in Britain in one or two days and will jointly consider solutions.</p>
<p>Paris, 20th (Guomin News Agency) - French newspapers expressed doubts about the effectiveness and value of the Indian Round Table Conference. Le Temps stated that Britain has failed to free itself from its shackles and is even more inclined to tighten them. Furthermore, the meeting has proven that the difficulties of India today are more due to the complexity of race and religion, and less due to Britain's attitude. The facts that have occurred in recent months have concretely indicated that to realize the psychology of Indians politically is not what wise people do.</p>
<h3>French and German Negotiations on Loans Awaiting Verification</h3>
<p>Paris, 20th (Guomin News Agency) - It is widely rumored here in Berlin and Geneva that negotiations are currently underway between France and Germany regarding loans, and they are progressing quite smoothly. However, official circles have not yet verified this claim. The extreme factions of the press in Paris are vehemently opposed to this move. The more moderate newspapers, which are more representative of public opinion, stated that if such loans are sufficiently guaranteed, they could alleviate France's excessive gold reserves and financial stagnation.</p>
<h3>Number of Bankrupt Banks in the United States Last Year</h3>
<p>Reaches Over 1,300</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) - In 1930, a total of 1,326 banks in the United States went bankrupt. In 1929, there were 642 bankruptcies.</p>
<h3>Second Day of Manchukuo-Japan Joint Transportation Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Dentsu) - The second day of the Manchukuo-Japan Joint Cargo Transportation Conference was held yesterday at the Railway Association. The following was decided: Regarding the first agenda item, the proposal for the Eastern Railway, (1) the proposal for the revival of the liaison transportation inspection of Japanese-Manchukuo cargo via Vladivostok, (2) the proposal for revival via Dalian were both passed. Regarding the second agenda item, the proposal by the Ministry of Railways, (1) the inclusion of the North Japan Steamship Co., Ltd. on the Vladivostok route, (2) the inclusion of the Soviet Russian State-owned Merchant Shipping Department were both passed. Next, the discussion turned to the third agenda item, the issue of cooperative transportation fees, which is the focal point of this conference. It was then decided to entrust 37 members to the committee from the third to the nineteenth agenda items. Tian Makoto, the head of the International Section of the Transportation Bureau, was elected chairman of the committee. The agenda items were divided into seven parts for discussion.</p>

<h3>Fourth General Meeting of the National Internal Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>The National Internal Affairs Conference held its fourth general meeting at the Lizi Society at 9:00 AM on the 21st. 57 members attended, chaired by Liu Shangqing. Secretary-General Lei Xiaocen announced the previous resolutions and reported on documents. The review officers from each group reported the results of their reviews of the proposals, and discussions began immediately. (A) Civil Affairs Group: (1) Proposal 2: The district system has more disadvantages than advantages, it is proposed to abolish it to reduce burdens and avoid obstacles. (2) Proposal 4: It is proposed to amend the County Organization Law. (3) Proposal 18: The township and town establishment measures stipulated in the County Organization Law should be adapted to local conditions and flexibly implemented to suit the people's sentiments. (4) Proposal 11: Proposed amendments to the Enforcement Law of the County Organization Law. (5) Proposal 27: County magistrates and assistant personnel should avoid being selected from their native places. (6) Proposal 32: In provinces affected by banditry, in handling autonomy, it is proposed to slightly extend the deadline and raise funds. (7) Proposal 39: Correcting the name of the Construction Bureau under the county government. (8) Proposal 40: Before the implementation of popular election of district chiefs, regarding the appointment of district chiefs, it is proposed to make appropriate changes to encourage talented individuals and suit the circumstances. (9) Proposal 47: Defining the limits of command authority between provincial, departmental, county, and bureau levels. (10) Proposal 50: Defining the scope of authority of district offices and public security bureaus. (11) Proposal 58: Determining the official document formats among city, county, bureau, district, township, neighborhood, and lane levels. (12) Proposal 79: Proposing that preparations for local autonomy should be made according to the actual needs of each county, with phased regulations on matters to be handled by district, township, and town offices, with the county government's bureaus appropriately allocating authority and transferring existing funds for guidance, and all old administrative regions should be amended according to the newly drawn autonomous regions. (13) Proposal 97: It is proposed to promulgate rules for evaluating district chiefs to ensure compliance. (14) Proposal 98: Each province should formulate appropriate measures based on local conditions, strive to complete the county organization in the near future, and complete local autonomy before the 23rd year. (15) Proposal 65: The authority of district offices and public security bureaus should be delineated separately (Review Opinion): The above 15 proposals are nothing more than two issues: legal and factual. The key points are the many difficulties in handling silk organization matters, which urgently need reform. It is proposed that the General Assembly send them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for review and handling separately. As for the measures in Proposal 98, it is proposed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs urge the provinces to handle them, considering the situation in each province. Furthermore, it is found that there are many places where the County Organization Law and the Autonomous Enforcement Laws for Districts, Townships, and Towns are not suitable for the situation in each province. As this matter concerns laws and regulations, it is inappropriate to lightly propose changes. It is proposed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs inform each province to provide details on the current handling situation, what obstacles exist, and how they should be modified, and then the Ministry will compile the cases, formulate a draft amendment, and submit it to the Central Government for approval to facilitate implementation. Member Zhang Fengjiu stated that the County Organization Law and its Enforcement Law, as well as the district autonomy organization system, were all decided by the Legislative Yuan and officially promulgated by the Central Government. He questioned whether this conference had the authority to arbitrarily change laws and suggested that the review opinions should be contributed to the Central Government for consideration. The original review report seemed quite appropriate. Member Lin Wenqin stated that the county organization and district autonomy organization system decided by the Legislative Yuan had many obstacles due to the differences in the situations in each province. This conference should consider both legal and factual aspects to ensure that the promotion is as beneficial as possible. Those attending this conference should strive for the convenience of internal affairs from the perspective of this conference and should not argue from the perspective of legislators. Subsequently, Zhang Fengjiu clarified that he did not oppose the review proposal. As a result, the chairman submitted the review opinions for a vote, which passed with a majority vote. (16) Proposal 55: Reorganizing the administrative regions of all counties in the country. (17) Proposal 65: Surveying and determining enclaves and assigning them to the jurisdiction of the county where they are located to unify authority and benefit administration. (18) Proposal 88: Proposing to survey the enclave areas of each province and county to clarify borders and unify political power. (Review Opinion): It is proposed that the General Assembly pass these three proposals in principle and send them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to formulate detailed basic measures for distribution to all provinces for compliance. The resolution was passed. (19) Proposal 7: Compiling publications with phonetic symbols to train the public to promote literacy. (20) Proposal 17: Training villagers to achieve general literacy. (21) Proposal 25: Implementing autonomy must start from the grassroots. (22) Proposal 60: Implementing public training to establish a foundation for autonomy. (23) Proposal 62: To complete local autonomy, attention should first be paid to rural education. (24) Proposal 94: Requesting the vigorous implementation of a compulsory people's literacy movement to promote training. (25) Proposal 100: Proposing that, in addition to the National Training Lecture Hall, townships and neighborhoods should hold lectures to expand training effectiveness. (Review Opinion): It is proposed that the General Assembly send the above proposals to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for consolidation and then, together with the Central Party Headquarters Training Department and relevant competent authorities, formulate a plan for implementing public training based on these proposals and issue it to all provinces and cities for earnest implementation to ensure that local autonomy can be completed as soon as possible. The resolution was passed. (26) Proposal 6: Planning for the allocation of autonomy funds, it is proposed to clearly define alternative measures to ensure certainty. (27) Proposal 16: Raising funds for autonomy. (28) Proposal 49: Determining the funds for districts, townships, and towns. (29) Proposal 61: Each province should establish special agencies for managing autonomy funds. (30) Proposal 62: Temporarily collecting doorplate taxes to serve as funds for township and town offices. (31) Proposal 73: Proposing to levy a special tax based on land area to serve as autonomy funds for each province. (32) Proposal 91: The expenses of township and town offices should be self-raised to facilitate the progress of autonomy (Review Opinion): The funds for autonomy in each province should still be allocated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs to each province according to the measures for allocating county autonomy funds. To the extent possible, funds should be allocated from the provincial taxes. If there are cases where funds cannot be allocated or the allocation is insufficient,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>then the method for collection shall be determined by the civil affairs department and approved by the provincial government before collection can occur, ensuring that the funds are sufficient. If the funds allocated for townships and towns are sufficient, they should be disbursed from the allocated funds. Otherwise, funds should also be raised for reserve according to the above procedures. If there are neither surplus funds available for allocation nor can funds be raised locally, the provisions in the Township and Town Autonomy Implementation Law regarding the funds for neighborhoods should be followed, with the method of self-raising determined by the residents' meeting, but with appropriate restrictions. The resolution was passed. (33) Proposal 48: Actively developing municipal administration (Review Opinion): This proposal is changed to a proposal for reorganizing municipal administration and sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for submission to the Central Government for implementation. The resolution was passed. (34) Proposal 54: Vigorously implementing the separation of city and county governance (Review Opinion): It is proposed that this proposal be passed and sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for submission to the Central Government for prompt implementation. The resolution was passed. (B) Police Affairs Group: (1) Proposal 5: Requesting the establishment of police officer schools and police training centers. (2) Proposal 75: Requesting the unification of police education (Review Opinion): The two proposals are discussed together. It is proposed that the Central Government should expand the organization of police officer colleges to unify national police education. Before the organization is expanded, the Ministry should still supervise the implementation of the police officer school and police training center regulations. The resolution was passed. (3) Proposal 51: Requesting attention to police education and the rapid establishment of police recruitment classes to improve quality (Review Opinion): The first item is passed in principle and handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for handling. The establishment of the second item, police recruitment classes, is considered a transitional measure to be handled by local authorities based on the circumstances. The resolution was passed. (4) Proposal 27: Requesting the Ministry of Internal Affairs to establish a police training center in Pingzu to prepare police talent for provinces to requisition at any time (Review Opinion): Handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for reference. The resolution was passed. (5) Proposal 14: Requesting the inclusion of practical health education in police training. (6) Proposal 81: The Guangdong Police Alumni Association requests the compilation of a police education curriculum (Review Opinion): The two proposals are discussed together and passed in principle, and handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for reference and improvement. The resolution was passed. (7) Proposal 82: The Guangdong Police Alumni Association proposes to establish a police library and translation center.

<h3>The Bandit Disaster in Seven Counties of Eastern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Five to Six Hundred Li Without Human Habitation</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Handling Post-Disaster Affairs in Yi County</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The bandit disaster in Eastern Jiangxi, especially in the seven counties of Guangxin under Yiyang, Hengfeng, and Dexing (namely, the Rao River and Xin River basin), is the most tragic. The bandit leaders Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping have been entrenched in Mopan Mountain, at the border of Yiyang and Hengfeng, since the 16th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1927], and have been harassing various counties on the borders of Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Zhejiang. Last year was the most rampant, with three occupations of Shangrao and Jingdezhen, and two occupations of Hekou, Raozhou, and Duchang. To the north, they invaded Hukou and Pengze; to the west, they harassed Yujiang. Although the five counties of Duchang, Yiyang, Fuliang, Shangrao, Leping, Wannian, Dexing and Hengfeng have been successively recovered by the Fifth Division under Hu Zuyu and the Fifty-Fifth Division under Ruan Zhaochang, the bandits have been entrenched in these seven counties for a long time, and the people have suffered deeply. All the villagers either fled to other places for refuge, were killed for opposing the communists, or were coerced into joining them. Some were even anesthetized and unknowingly became willing accomplices of the bandits. According to those who fled from Yiyang to the province, Mr. Hu Zuyu led his troops this time to attack the Qigongzhen area of the bandit region, for seven consecutive days, traveling about five to six hundred li on foot. Along the way, they only encountered seven or eight old farmers. Most of the houses in the villages they passed through were burned down, and the rest were dilapidated. The residents were coerced by the bandits to transport provisions into the mountains, and there was no sound. Even women and children were rarely seen. It was as if there were ten thousand miles of desolate sands with no human habitation. It is said that Mr. Hu is currently handling post-disaster affairs in Yi County, recruiting refugees, and allowing communists to reform.</p>
<p>Jiang Ji, the Director of Education, accompanied the Fifth Division to Yiyang from Jiujiang this time, and faced considerable danger. Currently, the provincial education sector is facing a lack of educational funding, as the educational fund surtax has been taken over by the central government. Repeated telegrams have urged Jiang to return to the province. Jiang has expressed great concern as scattered bandits are still very rampant. It is said that he will wait until the Fourth Division under Xu Tingyao arrives in the northern Jiangxi area and clears out the remaining bandits before he can safely return to the province.

<h3>Guangdong Troops Set Out to Enter Jiangxi to Suppress Communists</h3>
<p>The Sixtieth Division Pursues Southward in Two Routes</p>
<p>Troops from the Northeast and Northwest of Guangdong Province Head North</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The suppression of bandits on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border is becoming increasingly tense. The communists in southern Jiangxi have split into two groups and scattered, one group fleeing to Huichang and the other to Xinfeng and Nankang. According to recent news from the front lines, the Sixty-First Division under Dai Ji of the Nineteenth Route Army has arrived in Xingguo and joined forces with the Sixtieth Division under Cai Tingkai. The Dai Division is heading towards eastern Jiangxi, while a part of the Cai Division is heading towards southern Jiangxi. The two brigades under Qu Shounian and Shen Guanghan of the Cai Division are advancing towards Nankang and Yudu. On the sixth of this month, the Tan Qixiu Regiment of the Qu Brigade approached Nankang, and the Yun Yinglin unit of the Training Regiment continued to advance, successively scattering the bandit troops under Luo Yi who were entrenched in the county. Several dozen of Luo's more than one thousand bandits were killed, over one hundred were captured, and hundreds of miscellaneous guns were seized. On the eighth, the Tan Regiment recovered Nankang, and the bandit troops retreated to Xincheng. In the Xinfeng area, the Shen Guanghan Brigade is responsible for searching and suppressing the bandits. There are more than one thousand bandit troops near Xinfeng, led by a Lin, most of whom are unarmed or hold spears, lacking any fighting power and easily defeated. The vanguard of the Shen Brigade arrived at Yaotou on the seventh, and the Xinfeng bandit troops had already withdrawn from Xinfeng city on the sixth, fleeing to Anyuan, Xunwu, and other places. The Shen Guanghan Brigade arrived in Xinfeng on the eighth. After the Cai Division arrived in southern Jiangxi, several telegrams were sent to the province to discuss bandit suppression strategies with the provincial authorities. Although Nankang and Xinfeng have recently been recovered, more than two thousand scattered bandits are still hiding in Xincheng and Anyuan. The Eight Route Army on the Guangdong border has decided to advance towards the Jiangxi border, so as to join forces with the Cai Division in southern Jiangxi and encircle the bandits. It is said that the Shen Guanghan Brigade of the Cai Division in southern Jiangxi is pursuing the bandits towards Anyuan and Xunwu, while the Qu Shounian Brigade is pursuing the bandits towards Dayu. Guangdong is deploying in two routes to support them. In the northern Guangdong area, Huang Yanzhen is leading the Tan Langxing and Wu Jianxiong Regiments across Dayuling, to join forces with the Qu Brigade in Nankang. In the eastern Guangdong area, Zhang Da of the Sixty-Second Division is leading his troops to station in Jiaoling and Meixian, to support the Shen Guanghan Brigade and guard Xunwu, Anyuan, and other places. It is said that Brigade Commander Zhang Da has already set up command at Songkou. The Li Zhenliang Regiment under his command has deployed defenses along the Xunwu border, while the Chen Ju Regiment is stationed in Dabu, Songyuan, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, and Bashi. A large amount of military supplies were transported from the province by the Fu'an warship a few days ago, to replenish the troops at the front. As for the Huang Yanzhen unit in northern Guangdong, the Tan Regiment is the vanguard, advancing towards Dayu, followed by the Wu Jianxiong Regiment. After the Wu Regiment left Shixing, the Deng Hui unit of the Third Independent Regiment stationed in Shaozhou gathered at Jimu Mountain and set off to take over the defense. Furthermore, about one thousand new recruits from the Eighty-Eighth and Eighty-Ninth Brigades of the Sixty-First Division, who were training in the province, are also preparing to be led by Zhang Yan via the northern Guangdong route into Jiangxi. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau recruited three hundred laborers on their behalf, who are scheduled to depart today or tomorrow. (January 14th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Still in Fenyang</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Feng Yuxiang's movements have always been extremely secretive. Since Yan Xishan left Shanxi, Feng's whereabouts have been uncertain. Some say he is still among the people in southern Shanxi, while others say he is still in Fenyang. Whether this is actually true or not, there is no way to verify it. According to someone from Fenyang County who came to the province, Feng is still residing in an ancient temple in Wangta Village, near Yudao River in Fenyang. Wangta Village is fifty li from Fenyang County, located northwest of Fenyang city. There is a road right beside the village that leads directly to Fenyang city. Wangta Village is surrounded by paddy fields and abundant trees. The scenery is elegant. The ancient temple is located next to Wangta Village. The terrain is relatively high and the buildings are old-fashioned, but very spacious. From the temple, the surroundings can be surveyed with a commanding view. In the temple, Feng only reads and writes, rarely talking to people. The wine of Xinghua Village in Fenyang County has long been famous. Feng in the temple drinks the wine of Xinghua Village two or three times a day to increase his leisure. Between Wangta Village and Yudao River, there is a machine gun regiment from Feng's personal guard stationed. Outside Fenyang city, there is an officer training regiment from Feng's army stationed. Inside the city's Confucius Temple, there are about five or six hundred students from Feng's military academy stationed. It is estimated that there are more than two thousand troops stationed in Fenyang, and all supplies are provided by Feng himself. There is a foreign hospital in the city, managed by an American doctor named Wan, whose medical skills are excellent. He is highly regarded in the county. Wan has been friends with Feng for a long time, so Dr. Wan often visits when he is in Fenyang. Wan is also an important figure in the county's youth association. Two days ago, Dr. Wan and Feng had met. (January 15th)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Troops Stationed in Various Places in Shanxi and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the end of the war between Yan's and Feng's armies, as well as the troops of Sun Dianying and Gao Guizi, all have retreated to the southern and eastern Shanxi areas. Recently, in order to facilitate supply and maintain local security, they have been deployed in various ways and stationed in different areas. The latest deployment of troops is investigated as follows. The Sun Liangcheng unit of Feng's army is stationed in Quwo, Yicheng, Fushan, Jiang County, Wenxi and other counties under the Hedong Circuit. The Liang Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun units are stationed in Yuncheng, Yongji, Jiexian, Anyi and other counties around the Hedong Circuit. The Sun Dianying unit of mixed troops is stationed in Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping, Lucheng, Changzhi and other counties under the Jining Circuit. The Gao Guizi unit is stationed in Pingding, Xiyang and other counties under the Jining Circuit. From Linfen in Hedong Circuit to Suiyuan in the north, all are stationed by Yan's army. The Yang Cheng Yuan unit is stationed entirely in Linfen. The Yang Yaofang unit is stationed in Qi County, Taigu, Pingyao, and other counties. The Sun Chu unit is stationed in Yuci. The Wang Jingguo unit is stationed in various parts of Suiyuan west of Fengzhen. The Fu Zuoyi unit is stationed in Datong to Fengzhen. The Zhao Chengzhou unit is stationed in various counties south of Datong. The Zhang Huizhao unit is stationed in various counties of Wutai and Fanzhi. The Yang Xiao'ou unit and the Li Runsheng unit of military police, the Rong Honglu unit of guards, and the Zhou Dai unit of artillery, etc., are all stationed in the provincial capital and surrounding areas. The Li Shengda unit is stationed in Jincheng, Licheng, Yushe and other counties. According to those familiar with the military situation, the actual number of troops stationed in Shanxi and Suiyuan still exceeds 200,000. The Sun Liangcheng, Song Zheyuan, and Pang Bingxun units of Feng's army still have about 70,000 men. The Sun Dianying unit has about 13,000 to 14,000 men. The Gao Guizi unit has about 6,000 men.

<h3>Jilin Province's Financial Crisis is Extremely Severe</h3>
<p>Official Notes Plunge in Value</p>
<p>The People Face Total Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The provincial capital was previously affected by the rise in gold prices, and the market was sluggish. The business community had twice requested the authorities to instruct various banks to raise funds and provide loans to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. However, the banking syndicate did not have sufficient funds, and the matter was never realized. Since the beginning of the year, the monetary situation has become increasingly chaotic. The Harbin dollar has risen from 160-170 strings of cash per dollar to 260 strings of cash. The Jilin dollar has risen from over 140 strings of cash to over 200. The old "laotou" paper money has even reached 590 strings of cash in official notes per dollar. Silver dollars and silver dollar notes have also increased accordingly. The people of Jilin have traditionally used official notes as their standard. With the official notes plummeting in value, it is tantamount to declaring total bankruptcy. The financial crisis has reached its extreme. Some say that this was caused by the special business office of the Yongheng Official Bank, and there have been moves to file charges against the director of the bank, Liu Jun, requesting investigation. Zhang Zuoxiang in Liaoning was furious upon hearing the news and immediately summoned Liu to inquire. He also telegraphed the provincial government to transfer the Finance Department to send personnel to stabilize the situation, but it has not been effective. The General Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union of the provincial capital believe that the value of the official notes is controlled by the official bank, and that if the official notes are not raised in value, all four classes of people will be in dire straits. They have jointly laid out the facts and telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the bank be ordered to take measures to maintain the people's livelihood. The original telegram reads as follows: "To Chairman Xi Dai, Director of the Agriculture and Mining Department, and Finance Director Rong Yingjun: According to a joint petition from the various industries in the provincial capital, since the beginning of the lunar new year, the industries in the provincial capital have suffered from the disasters of gold notes, resulting in business losses, bankruptcies, and family ruin. Of the months that were counted, the total number of businesses that have ceased operations in the provincial capital has reached more than 800. The remaining shops that are still in business are also struggling to survive. The situation is difficult to describe. However, what the industries were uniquely hoping for was the assumption that, by the time autumn and winter came, the harvests would be in, business activity would be able to begin, and the market would naturally be able to turn around. The city was scarcely free from worrying over the grain carts that had just entered the city, before they were beset by the various harsh taxes of the Waterways Bureau, and burdened by the Municipal Administration's road donations. There was no escape from obstructions on both land and water. Consequently, the people in various locales all regard the provincial capital as a trap, the sources of grain carts have been cut off, and the market is trending more and more towards crisis. The industries had previously explained their straits, pleading for assistance in transferring and canceling the respective harsh taxes. It was previously received that the conference separately presented a request to the provincial government to grant exemptions. However, there has been no decree to this point. How it will be resolved in the future, it goes without saying that there should be a quiet wait for the indication of compliance. However, since the recent months, the varieties of round currency in Jilin Province have continued to rise and increase, with no end in sight. The credit of the official notes is actually trending downwards, with a state of chaos far different from that of the past. As for the first market opening since the Gregorian New Year, the price of daily gold rose by more than 80 strings of cash. The price of the Harbin dollar rose by more than 40 strings of cash. The prices of the other kinds of round currency also rose by 20 or 30 strings of cash. It seems that, with the official note’s price plunging, the people's hearts are exceedingly anxious, and the market is shaken extraordinarily. Official notes have been issued in enormous quantities, and are the low currency that circulates in this province. Although the actual value of the face of the notes is 100 times different from that of the initial issues, and has over the years been devaluated gradually, its impact was light when it came gradually. The current limit of the chaos, though, leaves one speechless. A drastic transformation has suddenly presented itself in the course of a single day. Whether one is a scholar, farmer, worker, or merchant, all have suffered boundless losses. The people's goods have vanished without a trace. The virulence of the harm is actually greater than that of great floods and fierce beasts. On these several days alone, the provincial capital's industries that have been harmed by the precipitous drop in the price of the official notes are everywhere. As the impact spreads, all goods are rising in price, and business is trending more and more towards crisis. The merchants and people stroke their brows and frown, not knowing what to do. Should it be allowed to continue on its natural course, without being given assistance, then the provincial capital's market is feared will not wait for the lunar new year's closure before the burden of money panic causes it to collapse. There will be more collapses than can be numbered. The extreme degree to which it will poison will directly harm the merchants and people, and will indirectly impact the tax revenues. Public and private are in crisis, and are advancing to their mutual doom. As they look to the road ahead, the hidden trouble has no limit. That kind of truly grave danger, it is supposed that it is clearly realized at the conference. The current crisis is extremely urgent. Total bankruptcy of the industries is, that is, now in front of one's eyes. In the end, how should it be planned to relieve the position, it is proper to jointly present a request to the conference for an approval. A quick implementation cannot be exceeded. To the utmost degree, [we are] respectfully waiting for orders,” Jilin General Chamber of Commerce Jilin General Labor Union document seal. According to this, in the current chaos, the official notes have reached their peak. The people's hearts are terrified, and the market is shaken. The various sections presented by the merchants are all true situations. It is imperative that, while the dog is still there, the gap be mended. I believe that the current measure to treat the symptom should make the maintenance of the official notes the most urgent task. If the price of the notes gradually increases, then the finance will be stable, and the people's hearts will be secure. How exactly should the implementation of the preservation be put into practice? It seems necessary to order the official money houses to quickly discuss and implement it. Then, will it be merely the blessing of the merchants and people, or will it also be the disaster of the situation of the entire province? Is there anything amiss? Please be so kind as to grant an approval for us to follow.</p>
<h3>Dai Minquan's Troops Transferred to Shenqiu and Xiangcheng to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Gushi Garrisoned by Ji Hongchang's Troops</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The newly organized Twenty-Fifth Division under Dai Minquan was previously concentrated in Gushi, eastern Henan, by order of Generalissimo Jiang, for reorganization and training, and was ordered to be reduced to a Class C division. Last month, it was inspected by Leng Xin, a counselor sent by Jiang, and was found to have more than 12,000 officers and men, and more than 9,000 rifles and carbines. It was reorganized into two brigades, and the remaining personnel were reorganized into an independent regiment. After the reorganization was completed, Dai sent personnel to submit the roster of officers and men to the General Headquarters in Nanjing. Jiang ordered them to be transferred to the Shenqiu and Xiangcheng area in eastern Henan to suppress bandits, under the control of the Second Route Commander. The defense of Gushi was taken over by the Thirtieth Division under Ji Hongchang, which was dispatched by Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Superintendent of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Provinces. Later, due to the rampancy of bandits and communists in Liuan and Huoqiu in western Anhui, the order was temporarily suspended, and the division was ordered to cooperate with other divisions in suppressing the bandits. Currently, banditry is rampant in the Shenqiu and Xiangcheng area. The local public defense corps recently sent representatives to Gushi to meet with Dai in person, pleading for him to move his troops to suppress the bandits and relieve the people's suffering. Dai, considering that the bandits and communists in Liu'an and Huoqiu might return to Shangqiu and Gushi after being encircled and suppressed by various armies, decided to dispatch the Seventy-Fourth Brigade under Wang Junqing and the Independent Regiment under Yang Dingcen to move to Shenqiu and Xiangcheng first, and they arrived at their defense area on the eighteenth. As for the Seventy-Third Brigade under Li Yushan, it is said that they must wait until Ji Hongchang arrives in Gushi to take over the defense before they can depart. (January 19th)</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Procedures for Replacing Police Chiefs and the Baojia System: It has been ordered that the local constabulary and the Baojia system be abolished, and that the police chiefs be uniformly replaced with township police to exercise the responsibility of urging the payment of grain taxes. Previously, the Finance Bureau had prepared surety bonds and sent them to the various district offices for forwarding and appointment. However, recently, the Finance Bureau has been repeatedly petitioned by local citizens and township chiefs in the Fourth, Twelfth, Fifteenth and other districts to withdraw the orders or order another selection, their reasons being nothing more than unsuitability of personnel, lack of credibility, poor character, and excessive vices. The collection office was also instructed to thoroughly investigate, as the township police are responsible for urging the collection of busy corvée, and the duties are important. It would be greatly affected by an inexperienced person, please maintain the original case, recall the new police appointment orders, etc. The district offices have different opinions, making it difficult to choose. The issue of whether the township police should be appointed based on the surety bonds submitted by the district offices or based on the report submitted by the collection office has been submitted to the county government meeting for discussion and decision. It has been decided that the township police are responsible for urging the collection of busy corvée. The county government has ordered the district chiefs that, in the future, when transferring the original township police, unless there is obvious illegal behavior, they may directly submit a request for investigation and handling. Otherwise, they should jointly conduct a thorough investigation with the field tax collection office before submitting a request for replacement. Three Bandits Executed by Firing Squad: Yao Jinshan, Cai Bujin, and Wu Xiaosi, two bandits from Fengjing, were previously arrested by Yang Shijie, a secret agent of the military police inspection office in Shanghai, and sent to the county and the Qingxiang Bureau for interrogation. The bandits confessed to the robbery cases and were sentenced to death according to law. The provincial government approved the death sentence by telegraph. On today (21st) at 10 a.m., the three bandits were taken to the execution ground to verify their identities and executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Earnest Plea from the Silk Industry to Maintain the Original Plan for Rescuing Silk Debts: The issuance of public bonds to aid the silk industry has been approved by the government. The amount has been revised to 8 million yuan, with 2 million yuan allocated for fundamental solutions, specifically for improving silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and 6 million yuan for assisting silk factories. Another 200,000 yuan will be deducted for printing the bond certificates. Silk merchants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai strongly advocate that the method of allocating the bond amount should remain as originally proposed, with an equal distribution based on the number of reeling machines. They resolutely oppose the suggestion of allocating half based on the number of machines and half based on the volume of silk exported by the factories. Recently, it was reported that the government, believing the silk market has improved and that there is no need to aid silk factories, has decided to allocate half of the 8 million yuan bond amount to aid silk merchants and the other half to improve silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It is also reported that this decision was approved at today's (2nd) Legislative Yuan meeting. Upon hearing this news, silk merchants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai generally feel that this approach is tantamount to only gaining a reputation for providing aid without actually benefiting. Moreover, at a time when the silk industry is declining, they are being asked to bear the obligation of repaying the debt, which has aroused extreme resentment. They have been exchanging letters and telegrams in opposition for days. In light of the pressing situation, the Wuxi Silk Factories Association urgently convened a meeting of all its members yesterday. More than 50 representatives from 42 factories attended, with Qian Fenghao presiding. After discussion, they resolved to unanimously oppose the decision and immediately telegraphed the government, requesting that it adhere to the original plan and approve the issuance of 7 million yuan in public bonds for the purpose of providing genuine aid to alleviate the plight of Jiangsu merchants. The original telegram is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"We have been investigating the silk industry relief bonds. Silk merchants from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have been petitioning for over three months. Although the silk market has recently shown some signs of improvement, factories with weak capital have already suffered near-total losses. They are eagerly awaiting the announcement and issuance of the relief bonds so that they can gradually resume operations. However, rumors suggest that some people are proposing to allocate these public bonds for the purpose of improving silk production, which is fundamentally contrary to the original purpose of aiding the silk industry. Furthermore, it is unfair to hold silk merchants responsible for repaying the debt without first lending them the funds. This would mean that factories that have temporarily suspended operations would have no hope of resuming, and even those that are struggling to stay open would find it impossible to sustain themselves. Upon hearing this news, all the factories were extremely indignant, believing that if these public bonds are diverted to other uses, it would be better to simply cancel them. If the government considers the immense suffering of silk merchants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai last year and shows extra compassion, we implore you to adhere to the original plan and approve the issuance of 7 million yuan in relief bonds to provide genuine aid and alleviate the plight of Jiangsu merchants. We also request that you approve the original plan requested last year, with the distribution equally divided among the more than 50,000 silk reeling machines currently in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to ensure fairness. We urgently send this telegram to you for your review and implementation. We await your command with the utmost urgency." Signed, All Members of the Wuxi Silk Factories Association.</p>
<p>Replacement of the County Public Security Bureau Chief: News from Zhenjiang indicates that Xu Jigui, the current Chief of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, who has diligently handled public security matters since taking office last autumn, will be transferred to a position in the provincial government.

<p>Rice Merchants Robbed in Changshu: A group of rice merchants from Changshu, led by a certain Mr. Jia, brought funds by boat to Wuxi with the intention of traveling to Yixing and Liyang to purchase rice. That night, the boat was docked in the Da Laoye Men Qian Bang in the 10th District of Yacheng. After 11:00 PM, more than ten bandits, armed with pistols, wooden clubs, and flashlights, suddenly appeared and searched each boat, tying up the boatmen, stuffing their mouths with cotton to prevent them from shouting. Although the villagers heard cries for help, it was late at night and the weather was cold, and they also heard gunshots, so they did not dare to come out and investigate. The bandits then looted at will for over an hour before leaving with their stolen goods. The total losses from the three boats amounted to over 1,300 silver dollars.</p>

Cai immediately led a team to Xiaolonggang in Jiangnan, where they found the pirate ship aground due to low tide. Both sides exchanged fire, and one pirate, Chen Haida, was captured. The stolen cloth was recovered, and Chen confessed that Fan Yatou and seven others were his accomplices. The remaining eight had fled and were not captured. Chen was transferred to the detachment headquarters on the evening of the 20th and then sent to the County Government for judicial processing.</p>

The people of Muyang City were greatly alarmed and jointly sent representatives to demand that Sun's troops submit to the central government, surrender their firearms to avoid devastation to the area. Unexpectedly, a small number of rebellious soldiers in Sun's troops stubbornly refused, cut the power lines, and attempted to harm the local area. However, they were no match for the superior forces and submitted to the confiscation. Another unit fled northeast. The County Magistrate, Xi Xikui, was initially abducted but managed to escape midway. Three shops outside the East Gate of Muyang were robbed. The government troops captured and executed seven people.

The county government issued arrest warrants. Subsequently, managers Hu and Dai fled. Now, Hu Qingfu suddenly returned and was spotted by a postcard merchant who informed the county government and requested that the case be investigated and handled. The county government ordered the police to arrest Hu and send him to the county government at 5:00 PM today. Just as the court was about to open, certain individuals intervened to mediate the situation. As a result, it is reported that the Wanhe firm first paid 3,500 silver dollars in cash, and the firm will pay the remaining 10,000 yuan by issuing promissory notes to be paid off over two years. It is reported that the plaintiff is now satisfied and has agreed to file a petition to withdraw the original case.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Night Ferry Sinks Rice Boat: The night ferry of the Pinghu Navigation Bureau, which departed from Shanghai on the 21st, collided with a local boat fully loaded with rice near the Huayuan Port outside Lugong Bridge as it sailed towards Pinghu. The local boat was heading towards the city to sell rice. Due to the lack of time to avoid the collision, the local boat was overturned by the ferry's tugboat. Two boatmen fell into the river but were fortunately rescued. However, the rice was soaked in water and suffered damage. The case was negotiated with the Navigation Bureau.</p>
<p>The County Magistrate Has Been Replaced: Shen Shihua, the County Magistrate of Pinghu, was previously transferred by provincial order to serve as a special commissioner of the Department of Civil Affairs. The vacancy was to be filled by Lu Youfu, but Lu has not yet taken office. It is now reported that the Department of Civil Affairs has appointed Wu Wentai to fill the vacancy. Wu is currently serving as the chief of the Unified Tax Bureau in Yuyao and will take office soon.</p>
<p>Zhu Lairong Escapes After Being Kidnapped: Zhu Lairong, a wealthy villager from Yangjiaku, Pinghu East Township, had previously received a threatening letter from bandits in the middle of the month, demanding a large sum of money. Zhu and his family moved elsewhere to avoid the bandits, and hired guards to watch over the house. On the morning of the 19th, Zhu heard that the bandits had retreated from the Quan Gong Ting area and secretly returned home to inspect the house. However, the bandits were very well-informed and had already detected his return. Five bandits armed with guns suddenly stormed into Zhu's house, captured Lairong, and forced him to head east. When they reached Quan Gong Ting, the bandits were planning to hide him when the Provincial Security Team stationed in Xincang arrived. Upon hearing the news, the bandits fled in panic, abandoning the hostage. Zhu was able to escape from the clutches of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>High Debts Lead to Robbery and Arrest: Jin Kui, the owner of the Jin Wenxing iron shop on Nan Street in the city, has been suffering from a series of misfortunes recently: his daughter died, his mother passed away, and his wife fled at the beginning of the month. Overwhelmed by debt and hounded by creditors, he became mentally disturbed. On the morning of the previous day, while wandering around the firewood shop of Gao Daodi outside the East Gate, he suddenly snatched a hat adorned with 47 pearls from the head of Xu Wangshi, the wife of Xu He from Xin Yan Tou, and ran towards Gao Daodi's place. Xu Wangshi shouted for help along the way and was eventually intercepted by passers-by. The victim recovered the stolen object and did not press further charges, releasing Jin Kui. Upon learning of the incident, the county government, deeming it outrageous that such a daylight robbery could occur so close to the county seat during the winter defense period, arrested Jin Kui that afternoon and sent him to prison after interrogation. Police officers were dispatched to search the store for evidence. Reviewing officer Zhu arrived at the scene to examine the injury and issued a seal order, instructing the victim to provide a formal complaint for a scheduled retrial and legal action.</p>
<p>School Principal and Patrol Officer Unite to Commit Robbery: Yang Yaoqi, owner of the Yang Tongyu dry goods store in Mazhu Town, Yao County, had recently received threatening letters from bandits demanding a ransom of 12,000 yuan to be paid at the Liangxiang Temple in Liuan Lake in the town. Yang secretly reported the matter to the local Public Security Bureau and the Defense Corps, who dispatched personnel to assist in the apprehension. Yang replied to the letters, feigning agreement to meet on the night of the 15th. They were captured as they arrived. Upon identification, it was recognized as a certain Zhang, the principal of the Liuan Lake Elementary School (23 years old, from Lin'an). According to Zhang's confession, Xu Guoliang, a patrol officer of the Public Security Bureau, and a local named Lao Afu were also accomplices. The two were subsequently arrested and handed over to the Yuyao County Government for interrogation on the afternoon of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Hearing on the Case of Dismemberment in Hanjiachitou: After the case of Zhang Zongyao being murdered and dismembered in Hanjiachitou, Shaoxing, the investigation team arrested several suspects and sent them to the local branch court for interrogation. After investigation and deliberation by the prosecution, it was determined that Hu Mianzhi, Shen Jinchang, Wang Yueming, Wang Luoshi, and Wang Lunzhu were suspected of violating Article 42 and Article 282, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. In accordance with Article 253 of the Criminal Procedure Law, an indictment was issued on the 20th and transferred to the criminal court for sentencing.</p>
<p>Provincial Approval for Assuming Responsibility for Foil Tax: Since the Shaoxing foil tax was changed to a business tax, the Foil Shop Association, Foil Trade Association, and the Shanghai Foil Industry Association jointly submitted a request to the Zhejiang Department of Finance to assume responsibility for collecting the Jiang Zhe foil business tax for the entire year, amounting to 2.22 million yuan. The Huzhou foil shops in Hangzhou also submitted a request to assume responsibility. The Department of Finance has now issued a directive stating that approval can only be granted after all the related businesses jointly agree.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We have read the news item in your newspaper on the 17th of this month regarding the derailment of the Jingliao train, which stated that the Jingliao train from Shenyang to the south derailed near Gaoling Station in Yuguan on the afternoon of the 16th, injuring several passengers. After investigation, we found that the Jingliao through express train departing from Liaoning to the south had its No. 214 locomotive's oil tank overheated and the east axle damaged at Gaoling Station in Yuguan East. A new locomotive was requested from the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot to replace it. The damaged locomotive was unusable and was moved onto a siding, where it derailed. This occurred after the locomotive was detached from the passenger cars and did not injure any passengers. The report in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. We respectfully request that you promptly correct this.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Formal Commercial Treaty with Egypt</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: On January 19th, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association sent a letter stating that the Shandong Henan Silk Industry Office wrote that it had sent a letter to your Chamber via the City Chamber of Commerce on June 14th of last year regarding the news that Egypt would double import duties on goods from countries without treaties, requesting that a treaty be signed with that country as soon as possible to remedy the situation, etc. After that, on July 31st, a reply was received, along with a copy of the exchanged documents between China and Egypt. The main idea, after careful translation, was a temporary commercial agreement that would expire on February 16th of this year. Now, according to a report from Jiu Cheng Xie and other members of the same industry, the foreign firms that directly export silk goods to Egypt have stated that after the new law on doubling import duties on goods from countries without treaties was announced in Egypt, the Chinese government negotiated a temporary commercial agreement with the Egyptian government within the extension period, extending the period until February 16th of this year. The expiration date of this agreement is approaching, and we should request that your industry immediately request that your country's government continue to negotiate a formal new treaty with that country to avoid impeding exports and causing hardship to merchants, etc. On the 15th of this month, a meeting of all members was convened to discuss the matter. It was unanimously agreed that this matter has a significant impact on silk exports. Countries like Japan have already signed new treaties with Egypt. If our country does not continue to sign a new treaty with that country within the time limit, it will not be able to receive the same treatment as other treaty countries. Moreover, if heavy taxes are levied, our country's silk trade with Egypt will inevitably be unable to gain a foothold. This fact is a major obstacle to the foreign trade of domestic goods, and the government should quickly sign a new treaty to maintain the foreign trade of domestic goods. After public resolution, a letter was sent to the industry association, requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be requested to quickly sign a commercial treaty with that country to benefit the foreign sales of domestic products, etc., which is hereby recorded and reported. We hope that your Chamber will forward this letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and request that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs quickly sign a treaty to remedy the situation and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. We cannot express our hopes enough. Based on this, the relevant letter is forwarded to you for your information. Please forward a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly negotiate a treaty with Egypt to prevent obstacles to the export of silk goods to that country. Based on this, we investigated the exchange of notes on the China-Egypt commercial agreement. We previously received a telegram from the Ministry, forwarded by Minister Shi, stating that it had been agreed to revise the last paragraph of the exchanged notes to read that the agreement would be valid for a long period unless a three-month notice of cancellation was given. This has been forwarded to the Silk and Tobacco Associations for their information and record. Now, the Silk and Satin Industry Association believes that this exchange of notes is still a temporary commercial agreement, and compared to the new treaty signed with Egypt by countries like Japan, the treatment is somewhat unequal. If the Egyptian authorities suddenly reverse their previous decision because China and Egypt have not signed a formal commercial treaty and levy heavy taxes on our country's silk exports according to the example of imports from countries without treaties, wouldn't our country's silk industry's foreign trade line be greatly hit? It is indeed reasonable to request that a formal commercial treaty between China and Egypt be signed quickly during this opportunity. Now, we are combining the situation and telegraphing the Ministry for your review and consideration. Please order Minister Shi in the UK to negotiate a treaty, which would be beneficial to the foreign sales of domestic products. This is a matter of public convenience.</p>

<h3>Foreign News Report: Methods to Remedy Silver Depression</h3>
<p>America and India Restrict Sales of Raw Silver</p>
<p>Various Countries Agree on a Fixed Ratio for Gold and Silver</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports: According to a special dispatch from London on the 19th, our reporter learned from well-informed financial circles that the cause of the severe drop in silver prices is said to be that the Indian government's sale of silver has a relatively light impact on the global silver market. The more important reason is that since the publication of the Hilton Young Commission's report on currency reform in 1926, a large amount of silver rupees have been received by the Indian treasury. Hee's proposal was to adopt a temporary gold exchange standard first, using both banknotes and rupees, and then gradually promote the issuance of gold coins. When the plan is fully implemented, only gold coins and banknotes can be used without restriction, and silver rupees will be completely reduced to subsidiary currency, with a limit of fifty coins for usage. As a result, countless surplus rupees have flowed into raw silver and sold back to the treasury, leading to a situation of oversupply of silver. The annual production of silver worldwide has remained largely unchanged until recent years. The year before last, it was 260 million ounces, and last year it had shrunk to 240 million ounces. If silver prices continue to fall, this year's production may be further reduced. However, a large part of silver production is a byproduct, so it is quite difficult to reduce production. If the silver mining industry continues to mine silver in the way that is most beneficial to itself, then the Indian government will also find it difficult to prohibit the continued sale of its surplus silver reserves. The recent sharp drop in silver prices is due to the fact that China's exports are not as strong as its imports, and there is a need for gold coins to pay for goods, resulting in very little demand for raw silver.</p>
<p>A reporter from the "North China Daily News" then consulted Mr. X, a gold broker, for his opinion on the silver market. He agreed with the aforementioned report. He stated that because China implemented new tariff regulations, imports were particularly strong last year, but there were no corresponding exports to offset them. As a result, it had no choice but to sell silver in London to exchange for gold to pay for the excess of imports. According to estimates by a London brokerage, Chinese banks have sold approximately 30 to 40 million ounces of raw silver in London. The recent difference of 0.0375 pence between the spot and forward prices of silver is due to this. However, another raw silver broker was quite skeptical that this estimate was too large. As for the sluggishness of China's exports, it is mainly due to the depression of European and American commerce, which has reduced purchases of Chinese products. It is also said that the American silver mining industry reduced sales from July to November of last year, when the silver price was around 1 shilling and 7 pence per ounce, in the hope that the silver price would rebound, which greatly helped to maintain the market price. Now, with large stockpiles and fears that India will continue to sell, which will cause silver prices to fall further, it is seeking ways to sell off the stockpiles. It is also a question whether the Indian government is prepared to sell again at the current silver price of 13 pence per ounce. According to Mr. X's opinion, if the Americans sell off their stockpiles, why would the Indian government hoard and not sell, thereby suffering losses? Therefore, this matter should first be discussed between American businesses and the Indian government, agreeing to stop selling each other if the silver price falls below a certain fixed price. However, the silver price problem is not so simple. Although India and the United States have great power to influence the silver market, restricting sales is not a fundamental solution. The silver market can only be stabilized after various countries agree on a fixed ratio for gold and silver. However, this is also very beneficial to various countries, because European countries, which used to sell silver coins at high prices, can now buy them at low prices and recoin subsidiary currency, making a considerable profit in one move. If this can be achieved, then the rebound in silver prices will not be far off.</p>
<h3>Brewing Sino-American Silver Loan to China News</h3>
<p>U.S. Senate Has Not Yet Convened</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports: According to a Washington dispatch received in this city this morning (21st), no negotiations have been heard regarding the State Department's proposal for the United States to lend China 200 million ounces of silver. Official sources also claim that the State Department has no knowledge of any details that could confirm such news. The U.S. government's proposal to lend money to China is still being brewed and has not yet been issued by the Senate office. This type of loan involves the government and must be approved by Congress, but Congress is not yet able to engage in this matter.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Commercial Press Dispute Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau Established</p>
<p>Signed a Treaty with Six Articles</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu Voluntarily Withdraws New Work Standards The general manager of the Shanghai Commercial Press, Wang Yunwu, implemented scientific management methods, leading to opposition from all employees, and the situation became very serious. Although the factory gate control problem has been resolved by signing an agreement, other issues, such as the new standards for the translation and editing department, have not been resolved. All employees held a meeting the night before last and decided that if mediation failed, they would implement a large-scale strike and carry out a campaign to oust Wang. Yesterday was the date set by the Social Affairs Bureau to convene mediation for this case. After a long period of discussion, six resolution methods were decided upon, announcing the establishment of mediation. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>The mediation meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 1:00 PM yesterday. The chairmen were Xu Zhi of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mao Yun of the Citizens Training Association, and Wang Guoxian of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The employer representatives were Wang Yunwu and He Bingsong. The employee representatives were Hou Dachun and Yang Youren. Those who attended on behalf of the employees were Lu En'an, Chen Yuesheng, Wang Changyuan, Wang Yongliang, Wan Pusheng, and Feng Yixian. First, the chairman reported that the case could be summarized into five issues. The factory gate control problem had already been resolved by mutual agreement the day before yesterday. The issues to be discussed by both parties today were: (1) New work standards for the translation and editing department; (2) Employee living conditions survey form; (3) Printing department attendance sheet; (4) Job transfers in the translation and editing department; (5) Compensation conditions. It was hoped that both parties would make concessions to establish mediation and eliminate the dispute. Then, employer representative Wang Yunwu stated the reasons for implementing scientific management methods. Next, employee representative Hou Dachun stated the reasons for opposing scientific management methods, and that it was inappropriate to announce them rashly without the consent of the employees. Wang Yunwu replied that the implementation of the new work standards for the translation and editing department was discussed on December 18th of last year at the Oriental Library, convening a meeting of the labor union and various department heads. Representatives from the three employee associations attended, and there were no objections at that time. After further announcement, there were also no objections from the four employee associations. Until the 9th of this month, the employees did not send representatives to negotiate or express their opinions, so it was announced immediately. The employees said that the reason there were no objections at that time was that General Manager Wang did not explain in detail, nor were there any specific methods. This first notice was issued entirely for the announcement of the new standards for the translation and editing department on the 9th, and was not related to the employee living conditions survey form or the attendance sheet. If the new work standards for the translation and editing department could be cancelled, then the employees would need to discuss other items. Wang Yunwu then stated that since the employees were unwilling to implement the new work standards for the translation and editing department, the employer could voluntarily withdraw them. After a long period of discussion, an agreement was signed. The chairman then announced that mediation was established.</p>
<p>The original text of the signed agreement and mediation document reads: The parties involved in the dispute listed on the right, regarding the union's order to employees not to obey management, were summoned for mediation by this committee. With the consent of both parties, an agreement was signed, and a record is made as follows: (1) The employer is willing to accept negotiations on the 19 compensation conditions previously proposed by the labor union, which can be handled as a separate case. (2) The employer declares that the new work standards for the translation and editing department were a well-intentioned reward method. Since the colleagues do not understand, the employer can voluntarily and in good faith withdraw them without hindering the company's management rights. (3) The labor union declares that the first notice from the four employee associations was issued specifically for the work standards of the translation and editing department. Since the new work standards have been voluntarily withdrawn by the employer, the first notice from the labor union will lose its effect. (4) In the future, the employer should fully consult with both parties before stipulating new work standards. (5) The labor union, in principle, approves of filling out the survey form, attendance sheet, and printed matter reporting form. (6) The labor union has no intention or action to interfere with the organization of the General Translation and Editing Review Committee or the transfer of work. This document was signed by the representatives of both parties and mediation was established, and should be regarded as a labor agreement between the parties involved in the dispute. Chairman Xu Zhi, Committee Members Wang Guoxian and Mao Yun, Hou Dachun, Yang Youren, Wang Yunwu, He Bingsong. Attendees: Lu Si'an, Chen Yuesheng, Wang Changyuan, Wang Yongliang, Wan Pusheng, Feng Yixian. Recorder: Wang Zhiqin. January 21st, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Representatives of Various Industries Yesterday to Discuss the Implementation of the Factory Law</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in preparation for the implementation of the Factory Law and to improve factory management, dispatched personnel to inspect factories in various industries starting on the 12th of this month, and summoned leaders of various factories to the bureau to explain and discuss matters within the scope of the Factory Law. Yesterday was the first day that the bureau convened to explain. The details of what was obtained are recorded below.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, those who reported were: Lu Feibo-hong, representative of the Chinese Industrial Federation; Xu Genghua, Wang Hanqiang, and Zhang Zilian, representatives of the China National Products Preservation Association; Song Peidao, Xiang Longxun, Li Pengyun, and Ji Jiannan, representatives of the Machine Industry Association; Tian Heqing, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau. The report covered the implementation opinions of the government's promulgation of the Factory Law and the Factory Law Implementation Regulations, in order to be adopted. Then the talks began. The representative of the China National Products Preservation Association suggested: (1) All factories, Chinese and foreign, should implement the law uniformly; (2) Both labor and management should implement the law uniformly; (3) Time off, holidays, and night work for female workers, etc., should be granted a period of hesitation for certain industries; (4) Places where the text is easy to misunderstand should be clearly explained; (5) Li Pengyun suggested that Article 1 of the Factory Law should be clearly defined; (6) Xiang Longxun suggested that the implementation of the Factory Law be postponed; (7) Wang Hanqiang suggested that when the Factory Law is implemented, if there are any difficulties, the Social Affairs Bureau should formulate specific relief methods to supplement the deficiencies of the Factory Law; (8) Song Peidao suggested that with regard to Article 36 of the Factory Law, running remedial education is difficult for small factories to bear, and there are more difficulties in running it. This education should be run by administrative agencies; (9) Li Pengyun suggested that the amount of compensation in Article 45 should be calculated by grade according to the amount of capital; (10) Lu Feibo-hong suggested raising the question of whether workers paid by the day and workers paid by the piece, and other workers of a temporary nature, should be given wages during holidays in accordance with the Factory Law; (11) Ji Jiannan suggested that with regard to Article 3, Item 2 of the Factory Law, there is no reliable proof of the date of entry into the factory. If old workers entered the factory many years ago, and there are no records in the various factories, how should this matter be handled with regard to future compensation and the number of holidays; (12) Lu Feibo-hong suggested that factory meetings are not clearly stipulated in the Factory Law, and whether it is forced to implement them, whether each factory is forced to form an industrial and commercial meeting. At the same time, there are no clear regulations in the factory organization regulations. The Chinese Industrial Federation suggested: (13) The Factory Law does not apply to short-term workers, that is, those who are paid by the day or by the piece, and should be clearly defined. Rong Zongjing and Xu Qingtang, representatives of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, did not attend the meeting because they arrived at the bureau after the meeting had dispersed. It is heard that the bureau will convene representatives of the letterpress and color printing industries this morning, and representatives of the cosmetics industry this afternoon, and will print an explanatory table of the Factory Law and distribute it to the representatives of the various factories.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Requests Strict Punishment for Neglect of Duty by Police Officer</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Chinese Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, we have received a letter from Mr. Qian Yating of Danfeng Silver Shop at No. 169-170 North Xizang Road, stating that at 12:10 PM on the 17th of this month, his shop was invaded by seven robbers who stole over ten taels of gold items, valued at 1,200 yuan. This incident was reported in the local news section of the Shenbao the following day. We respectfully present two points to your association and hope that you will raise them with the Public Works Department to safeguard the future peace and tranquility of our Chinese merchants. Firstly, after the robbery, the police officer No. 1254 stationed at the intersection of Kaifeng Road witnessed the group of robbers fleeing into the Chinese area. Despite being reported by the victim, he turned a blind eye and did not sound the alarm, allowing them to escape. This matter can be verified in the records of the First Division of the Fourth District. The patrol officer has the direct responsibility to protect, but his actions suggest intentional collusion with the robbers. We request your association to raise this point and ask the Public Works Department to strictly order the police station to investigate thoroughly. Secondly, after Chinese and Western detectives investigated and confirmed the facts of the robbery, at around 3:00 PM that afternoon, Western Sergeant (No. 52) Yak and a team of Chinese and Western detectives arrived for a second time and interrogated Yating harshly, claiming that the robbers must have escaped through small alleys and would not have taken the main road. They asked, 'Are you more capable than the detectives? How could you see so clearly? You must be lying.' Despite Yating's repeated explanations, he was taken to the police station for questioning. In Sergeant Yak's office, Yak personally interrogated him. Yating reiterated the facts and stated that the Chinese police in the Chinese area pursued the robbers and that the First Division of the Fourth District could verify this. However, Yak became angry and said sternly, 'If you say the Chinese police are so capable, why don't you move your shop to the Chinese area? Your words are slippery, you must be lying.' Yating replied, 'If I am lying, you can shoot me.' The interrogation continued for two hours. We believe that the police station has already borne considerable responsibility for failing to apprehend the robbers after the robbery, but instead, they insulted the victim in every way possible, attempting to evade responsibility. The insult to Yating is a small matter, but the insult to all Chinese merchants in the district is a great matter. At a time when the clamor for the recovery of national rights is widespread, the police station has engaged in such illegal behavior. Yating could have remained silent, but for the sake of the future peace and tranquility of all Chinese merchants in the district, he must ask your association to uphold justice and promptly negotiate with the Public Works Department to severely punish Sergeant Yak for his deserved crime. We anxiously await your response. Attached is a copy of the Shenbao local news report from the 18th of this month, and we hope you will review it for reference." The association believes that crime incidents in the district, such as kidnappings, occur frequently. The association suspects the ability of your department to maintain security. Mr. Fei Xindun, the president of your bureau, often said that the Chinese do not cooperate with your bureau and do not report to the police. According to the previous letter, your bureau is extremely unwilling for victims to report to the police, as if you are sitting back and enjoying the taxes provided by the taxpayers. Otherwise, why would the police officer on duty fail to pursue the robbers after being informed? Why would the police officers make things difficult for the victim and accuse him of lying? The director of your department does not notice or correct the police officer's harassment of the victim, and instead says that the victim did not report it. This proves that it is all deceitful talk. We hereby request your bureau to strictly punish the sergeant and the police officer for their dereliction of duty. In the future, you should give absolute respect to the victims' responsible reports and provide them with security protection. Only in this way can the trend of bandits and thieves be extinguished, your bureau's responsibility be fulfilled, and taxes be used to protect the lives and property of taxpayers. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter."</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Rice Industry's Appeal Regarding the Increased Passport Fee in Wuhu</h3>
<p>The rice industry in Guangzhou, concerned that the Wuhu Finance Department has announced that, starting January 20th, the passport fee for transporting rice to Guangdong will be increased by six jiao per shi, increasing costs and hindering the food supply in Guangdong, telegraphed to Shanghai native associations, appealing: "Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association, Guangdong Businessmen's Association, Guangdong's grain is not stored, relying on foreign relief. Gold prices have recently risen, and foreign rice imports have decreased. We can only rely on rice supplies from Wuhu. Yesterday, the Anhui Finance Department announced that, starting January 20th, the passport fee for transporting rice to Guangdong will be increased by six jiao per shi, increasing grain prices and hindering the food supply in Guangdong. Please telegraph the Ministry of Yuan requesting Anhui to cancel this fee. Huang Qiyun, Chairman of the Guangzhou Rice Bran Distribution Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Important News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>The ten thousand yuan in customs duties returned to Swire Company's new Beijing ship: when the ship was exporting the day before yesterday, it was discovered that 100,000 silver dollars were loaded by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China to Ningbo without a passport and were seized by Customs. It was presented on the spot and taken to the Customs warehouse. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday, the two banks requested the Customs to return it after providing a supplementary passport, and then load it to Ningbo. However, because there was a shortage of eight yuan, the Customs compensated for it and the two banks took it away. However, Swire Company dismissed Li Yunian, the head of the sailors of the ship, for secretly transporting a large sum of money without reporting to the company, and replaced him with Tang Xianliang. This matter has been resolved.</p>
<p>Two aircraft to be picked up in Beijing immediately: The last batch of two aircraft purchased from the United States has been shipped and has arrived, but because Finance Minister Song Ziwen went to Peiping, the passport has not been issued, so it has not been picked up. It is currently stored in the Dala Cargo Warehouse in Bailianjing. Now that Zhu is returning south, Dala has telegraphed to urge the pick up.</p>
<p>The Sanjiang ships sail as usual: the China Merchants Bureau received a telegram from Beijing yesterday, stating that the Jiangji, Jiangxin, and Jiangtian ships have been ordered to return to Shanghai and will sail as usual today.</p>
<p>Small wheel ship sailing the ocean: Saito Bunzai, president of the Japan Mail Company, specially formed a Nanyang inspection team to develop the shipping industry and personally went to inspect it with fourteen people, including his secretary. They departed yesterday and have assigned a 42-ton small wheel ship for ocean sailing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Daishengchang Plans to Restore Shipping on the Xiang River</h3>
<p>Foreign merchant ships entering our inland areas are most common with Japanese merchants. Daishengchang Shipping Bureau has a large influence in the lower Yangtze River area, in addition to the inland river shipping in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and has penetrated into various inland ports. After repeated negotiations by the National Government and the local authorities in Hunan, the Daishengchang Wharf in Hunan Province was taken back by our country. Recently, the water level in central Hunan has been very shallow, and ships with a larger draft cannot sail. Japanese merchant Daishengchang plans to take this opportunity to make a comeback. The news obtained by Chiang is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha plans to open shipping again: The annual freight volume from Changsha to Hankou is huge. During the winter when the water is shallow, the small wheel business is excellent. Japanese merchant Daishengchang has ships sailing in various inland areas of the Xiang River and has made huge profits over the years. After being taken back by our country last year, the company's wharf has been taken over by the Hunan Provincial Government. Recently, the Japanese merchant, seeing that Hunan rice can be exported and large ships cannot sail, is using the opportunity to secretly send a Chinese person with Japanese nationality to operate a shipping bureau in the name of a Chinese, restoring the previous routes and schedules in Changsha and Xiangkou. However, since the wharf and freight yard have been taken over by the provincial government, it is contacting the Hunan branch of the Sanbei Company to rent its wharf for ship berthing. The Sanbei Company believes that this matter relates to our national sovereignty and would not privately lease it and has sternly refused. However, it is said that if this matter is certain to happen, it will contact other shipping companies to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>A major disaster occurred in the Anhui route: The Daishengchang Shanghai Bureau received a report from the Wuhu branch and the Dala Shipping Company, its agent, stating that on the small wheel from Wuhu to Lujiang, there were six retired soldiers among the passengers. When the wheel arrived in southern Anhui, there was a conflict between the soldiers and the local security team soldiers on board. The six retired soldiers seized weapons and fired wildly on board, injuring two security team soldiers and killing a team leader. Then they forced the wheel to take the wheel to the Jiang.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Bian, the six people then landed and fled. The people on the ship did not dare to step forward to arrest them because they had military equipment, causing them to escape. When the ship arrived in Wuhu, the security team received the news and went to the bureau to collect the body of the team leader for coffin burial. The bureau has therefore suspended business for many days. Now, this case has not been resolved because the murderer has not been caught.</p>
<h3>Acting Turkish Representative Ford Pe's Periodic Banquet for the Diplomatic Community</h3>
<p>Acting Turkish Representative Ford Pe is returning, and it is scheduled to hold a banquet at his private residence on Xiafei Road at 8 pm on February 7 to entertain envoys, consuls, and leaders of various agencies from various countries stationed in Shanghai. Hundreds of invitations have been sent out and it is said that it will be a spring banquet with a festive nature.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Cholera is Particularly Important This Year</h3>
<p>Citizens must be especially careful about food and drink</p>
<p>Vaccinations should be given from May onwards</p>
<p>Before the 16th year of the Republic of China, cholera epidemics in Shanghai every summer and autumn resulted in the tragic death of tens of thousands, and there were even alarming reports of coffins being sold out. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the most attention has been paid to the prevention of this disease. In recent years, the epidemic has been greatly reduced, which is a major contribution to the safety of citizens. However, the general sentiment is that it is easy to forget the past after things have passed. It is more important to pay attention to the hard work of the head and the lack of foresight. According to the research of the Municipal Health Bureau and the experience of the facts, this summer and autumn will be the year of the large-scale cholera epidemic. In terms of theory, cholera is a time-sensitive and violently transmitted infectious disease. The bureau has prepared a detailed prevention plan and submitted it to the municipal government for approval and allocation of appropriate funds for the implementation of prevention work as soon as possible. On the citizen side, everyone should know the benefits of injecting cholera prevention needles to increase their own resistance. Foods that have been touched by flies and mixed with raw water are the best way for cholera germs to enter the abdomen and should not be eaten. The bureau will conduct widespread guidance in order to make it known to every household and prevent the harm of cholera spreading and raging.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Issue for Two Railways</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Railways approved the issue of the year-end bonus for the Jinghu and Kangyong railway employees in the 19th year, the railway bureau issued it immediately. However, due to the fact that the railway's operating income last year actually broke the past record, totaling more than 13 million yuan, the employees also made minor contributions to their daily hard work. Therefore, they intend to jointly submit a request to the railway authorities to request the Ministry of Railways to quickly approve the half-month bonus to comfort the public and encourage work.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Rickshaw Pullers' Union Petitioned the Municipal Party Department Yesterday</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the rickshaw pullers' union in Zhen'anli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, after being inspected by the police of the Second Division of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau a few days ago, dispatched representatives Liu Fujun, Lu Liangbi, Zhu Fengxiang, etc., thirty-nine people, carrying a petition to the Municipal Party Department at 9 am yesterday. The representative of the Civil Training Council came out to meet and asked about everything. The representatives described the inspection in detail. Afterwards, it was replied that there are currently four rickshaw pullers' unions, and the reason why the Public Security Bureau sealed them up was because it was not clear which was true or false in Ximen Road and Bai'er Road. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau took the opportunity to conduct an inspection. As for the request to reduce the rent of cars, it has been approved by the Social Bureau and has finally achieved a satisfactory result. The request to open Meng Jinchen's residence and restore the club, I cannot resolutely agree to this, I must wait for the Executive Committee of this department to discuss and mediate. According to this, the representatives resigned and exited. It is heard that the representatives of the union will carry a petition to the Municipal Social Bureau today to continue their petition.</p>

<h3>Red Cross Relief Efforts in Yingkou Completed</h3>
<p>Li Zhenbang Reports on Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society sent special member Li Zhenbang last year, carrying thousands of cotton clothes and dozens of disaster relief workers to the Yingkou area of ​​eastern province to distribute and send the children affected by the disaster to various philanthropists for adoption and learning crafts. It has now been completed and returned to Shanghai last month. Each disaster victim who received the distributed cotton clothes was required by the responsible agency to fill out a receipt, sign and seal it, and the disaster victims personally signed it as proof. Those who adopted the children affected by the disaster, in addition to following the Red Cross regulations, also took a photo with the children and deposited it in the General Assembly for reference. The remaining 18 children affected by the disaster are personally responsible for education by Li Jun Zhenbang and are still in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Receives Disaster Reports from Yancheng and Suqian</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a report from the Yancheng County Chief of Henan, Zhenwu Branch Chairman, regarding the disaster situation in Yancheng. It is disclosed in the following telegram: "Yancheng has been plagued by droughts, locusts, hailstorms, and bandits. The most tragic and painful is the war disaster. Since spring last year, large armies have been stationed in the territory or passed through, sending vehicles to pull husbands to provide silkworm species. The winter of the Tang rebellion used Yancheng as its base based on its geography to mix with bandit-style troops. There were up to 150,000 or 160,000 people. They gathered in the county and lived in people's houses. Every house in the city and countryside was filled with troops. Livestock and property were looted. Doors, windows, tables, and chairs were all burned. When the Tang rebels were defeated, they expected to take a breather, but unexpectedly, the insurgents Lu and Feng rebelled, and the central government denounced their crimes. The encirclement and suppression lasted for more than half a year. The trenches were horizontal and vertical, and the wheat harvest was destroyed. The city gates were reduced to rubble and the villages turned into ruins. The Northwest Army drafted soldiers and appropriated funds to search for food, not hesitating to fish out. Wang Zhen, Liu Guitang, and other bandits set up tickets and le , rape, and looting. Wherever they passed, the ground was dug three feet deep. The total loss in the county is estimated to be more than 20 million yuan. Now there are more than 100,000 disaster victims who have no clothes, no food, and no homes to return to, crying out for death. I sincerely ask your meeting to have great compassion and quickly allocate funds for relief to the Soviet Union. I am extremely grateful and humbly report this for your consideration. Han Guangyu, Magistrate of Yancheng County, Henan Province, Yang Zhenzhong, Chairman of Zhenwu Branch, respectfully."</p>
<p>The association also received a public letter from the Su Liqian County Provisional Disaster Relief Committee requesting relief, stating that the county has suffered from water and bandit disasters, and the situation is extremely tragic and in urgent need of relief. It has already been communicated in two letters for inspection. Recently, it was approved by the Anle Township Chief of the Fourth District, Wu Ruiguang, who stated that the job is located in Xiaosanxiatu, which originally belonged to Xiaosanxiatu, all of which are lake fields, known as Wuxia. Farmers plant wheat for a living. How could this year's March bring heavy rains, and the fields are full of waves and the two wheat are flooded. There are more rains in the summer, and the whole becomes a swamp, resulting in no autumn harvest. In the lunar June, it was attacked by a large number of bandits, which was unbearable. There were gun racks and burnings and killings, none of which were not there. After the Guirenji bandit was severely attacked by the army, they completely retreated to the township. After three or four days and nights, the shops and villages were burned, looted and destroyed, and the cruelty was even more extreme. Even now, the wheat has not been planted, and the fields are deserted. In addition, the winter is getting deeper and deeper. The wailing is heard everywhere, and it is unbearable to hear the hunger and cold. If you do not give alms, you will not be spared in the future. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate each household and give alms. All the strong men can avoid drifting away, and the old can avoid ditches. While it was being handled, the public office of the Ninth District sent a letter, saying that the gushen and the Nanjian Zhudabin villages in the district have been occupied by bandits for a long time, and the houses were burned down until the end, leaving only ochre walls standing alone. The property was looted, and the people were suffering. Living in the open air with no shelter, they were starving and freezing. The ancient god has more than 100 disaster victims, and the Nanjiang Zhudabin village has more than 50 disaster victims, who are in urgent need of kindness. I hope that your association will ask for relief on their behalf and release it as soon as possible to save the disaster from the nine deaths and one life. The other wait for the approval to come to the meeting immediately and send the poor to the four or nine districts to check the disaster situation. The disaster situation is indeed real. The disaster victims are indeed suffering from no food and clothing. It is difficult to list them one by one. It is appropriate to transfer the situation and ask your meeting to mourn the famine-stricken people and quickly give a huge sum of money to release them to save the lives of the survivors. The urgency is unsurpassed.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Jishin Association's Shaanxi Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The China Jiheng Association is handling disaster relief in Wugong, Shaanxi. The economy has been exhausted and gradually expanded. At first, there were only two shelters for disaster-affected children. Later, due to the winter season, it raised funds to open a porridge factory, which was crowded with people seeking food. It was changed from one factory to three factories, but it was not enough to meet the needs of the three porridge factories, according to the telegram from Lu Hefu, Dai Zhenshan, and others from the Xi'an Jisheng Branch. It was requested to add more to benefit the disaster victims. Therefore, the fourth porridge factory in Wugong Youfeng Town was set up again. According to the telegram received yesterday, the fourth porridge factory has been prepared. The association specially remitted 8,000 yuan of the porridge factory to Hongfeng Village on the 15th through Jin Liyuan Wharf Xiexin Chengzhan Zili Zhong. In addition, the association prepared 1,000 sets of cotton clothes to be distributed to the elderly, weak, and poor people who eat porridge. It has been made in Xi'an and is being distributed. In the midst of this icy and cloudy land, the association embodies the virtue of the good life of God and strives for the cause of relief, which is particularly rare.</p>
<p>The association recently received a letter from Lu Hefu and Dai Zhenshan from the Xi'an Branch, stating that the huge sum of money from Juyuan De has been collected at the end of the month, and the 15,000 yuan remitted by Jifenghou has also been received. They were all replied by telegram on New Year's Eve last year. The Wugong porridge factory feeds nearly 10,000 people every day. There is no such thing as Wuyi after the great robbery. The disaster victims are deeply traumatized. Those who had fled outside in the past now hear that the factory has been opened to distribute porridge and come back one after another. Without cotton clothes to keep out the cold, they sleep under broken tiles and ruined walls at night, and crawl at the door of the porridge factory during the day to cry and beg for clothes and porridge. The sad voice can really startle the deaf. At present, the disaster victims in Wugong are in a state of waiting for relief. The fate of life and death is competing for this moment. Please use the means of returning to heaven to make the final rescue. It is heard that the association has added a fourth porridge factory in Wugong Youfeng Town to engage in rescue. However, depending on the situation in Wugong, more porridge factories need to be added to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnapping Cases Cracked</h3>
<p>Gu Rusheng, an officer of the Inspection Office of the China Merchants Bureau, found a woman carrying two boys on a certain wheel ship of the bureau at around 10 am yesterday. Their behavior was very suspicious. He asked about the origin of the two children. The woman's speech was ambiguous. After careful observation of the woman's face, it was discovered that she often brought women and children on the wheel. He immediately detained the woman and the two children and sent a letter to the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate. Director Xu took the man to the case for interrogation. When asked, the woman confessed that her name was Sun Gao, 43 years old, from Shaoxing. The two children, one named A Mao, is my own son, and the other named Jin Fu, is my nephew. Now I plan to take them to Fujian to study. When asked, one of the children, named Gao A Mao, is nine years old. The rest cannot be answered. One of the children, named Li Jin, is ten years old. His father's name is Changsheng and lives in the fish pond in Wangji Harbor, Chang'an Township. She (referring to the woman) often comes to my house. Sometimes she gives me food. She said that Shanghai is a very good place. He asked me to go to Shanghai to study with him, but said that this matter should not be known to my mother, so I lied to my parents and came to Shanghai with him, which has been five days. Because it is a case of trafficking in human beings, the case is important, and he ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. In addition, detective Yang Chunting and Wang Jiheng found a woman carrying a boy among the passengers on the Wanxiang wheel ship parked at the Dada Wharf at about 12 pm yesterday. They looked flustered, so they went forward to arrest them and brought them to the team. When Director Xu interrogated her, the woman confessed that her name was Li Wang, 27 years old, from Fuzhou. This boy's name is A Di, 5 years old, from Jiangbei. I gave 150 silver dollars to buy him from someone. Now I plan to sell him to Yue Province. Because the case involves private relief, he ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers Failed to Abduct on Xizang Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Mu Jingshan Refused to Leave, Resolutely</p>
<p>The Thugs Were Powerless</p>
<p>Police Whistles Blew, and Passersby Gathered</p>
<p>Four Kidnappers Staggered and Fled for Their Lives</p>
<p>Around 10:00 AM yesterday, at the intersection of Xizang Road and Xiamen Road, several kidnappers stopped a hired car in an attempt to abduct Mr. Mu Jingshan from Ningbo. Fortunately, the officer on duty discovered the situation and blew his whistle loudly, frightening the kidnappers and causing them to flee. Mr. Mu was unharmed. The kidnappers had previously rented a car from the Yangzi Automobile Company on Yong'an Street in the French Concession for the purpose of transporting the hostage. Unfortunately, their efforts fell short of success, and the plan failed just before completion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Well-Dressed: The Yangzi Automobile Company is located at No. 183 Albert Road in the French Concession and has a branch at No. 68 Yong'an Street. Around 9:45 AM yesterday, a man in his thirties, wearing a gray satin robe, went to rent a car. He claimed that he wanted to pick up a guest and take him to Yangshupu Road. He identified himself as Zhou Zhengrong, residing at No. 168 Yangshupu Road. At the time, the clerk ordered driver Wu Jingming to drive the Buick sedan with license plate No. 12362 to serve the customer. This so-called Zhou Zhengrong was carrying a rectangular yellow travel bag and was well-dressed and spoke eloquently. When the car left, he did not specify the price, but only requested it to be calculated by the hour. After the customer boarded the car, he instructed the driver to drive to Xizang Road. Upon reaching their destination, the driver stopped the car at the entrance of Hongfu Lane on Xizang Road and Xiamen Road, with the car facing north.</p>
<p>Wanting to Speak But Hesitating: Upon arriving at Xizang Road, the driver stopped the car as instructed. However, before getting out of the car, the customer suddenly opened the leather bag in the car and took out a paper package. The driver did not know what was stored inside, only that it was wrapped in newspaper. The customer took the paper package in his hand, calmly got out of the car, and went straight into the alleyway, disappearing in an instant. The driver waited for about ten minutes, but the customer did not return. He was quite suspicious, but he saw that the leather bag was still in the car, so he did not suspect anything else. At that moment, he suddenly felt the car door opening by itself. Just as he was surprised, two burly men jumped onto the car seats, each occupying one seat, sandwiching the driver Wu Jingming in the middle. Wu tried to speak, but the two men's guns were pointed directly at his waist, not allowing him to make any noise. So he wanted to speak but hesitated, his strength failing him.</p>
<p>Inviting the Prey into the Trap: Moments later, about a few steps away from the car, two thugs were seen dragging a man wearing a black tan leather-collared coat towards the car. However, this man stood his ground, resolutely refusing to abandon his hired car and sit in the car. The two sides struggled, and their shouts attracted passersby, who came to see what was happening. At this time, the two thugs were flustered and did not know what to do. The officer directing traffic on the high lighthouse on Xinzha Road and Xizang Road saw the situation and knew that it was not a good thing. He immediately blew his whistle loudly, summoning several police officers.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Car and Fleeing: In that split second, the two thugs watching the driver saw that the plan had failed and hurriedly opened the car doors and fled north. When the two men got into the car, they immediately asked the driver where the ignition switch was so that they could drive away immediately after the God of Wealth boarded the car. However, the driver did not know their intentions. When he stopped the car, he not only stopped the engine, but also locked the engine door with a key, so the two thugs were powerless and had to abandon the car and escape. At that time, the two thugs who were dragging and struggling on the road also let go and ran away. The Abducted Escape: The man wearing the black leather-collared coat was Mr. Mu Jingshan from Ningbo. He lived in Tangjiawan, Nanshi, and ran pawnshops, managing both Taichang and Taifeng pawnshops. Taichang is in Nanshi, while Taifeng is at No. 451 Kaifeng Road, North Xizang Road. Mr. Mu went to Kaifeng Road every morning at 10:00 AM, so he was coveted by the kidnappers. Fortunately, the abduction was escaped just before completion, which was fortunate in the midst of misfortune. However, Mr. Mu Jingshan has recently received threatening letters. The Old Gate Police Station sent detectives to investigate the incident afterward.</p>
<h3>Old Man Torn Up By Bandits</h3>
<p>Body Thrown into the Sea</p>
<p>Shi Shangzhi, the old owner of the Shiyongshun Fish Shop on Doushi Road, Wusong, lived on Duck Nest Sand Island, Wusongkou. He was 75 years old this year. Several months ago, he was kidnapped by sea bandits, who demanded a large sum of money for ransom. However, Mr. Shi's family was not very wealthy and could not afford it. Although they contacted several times, they did not reach an agreement due to the large discrepancy. Mr. Shi lived in the bandits' den for several months, but he was old and weak. In addition, the weather was very cold recently, so he fell ill in the bandits' den and was about to die. The bandits, because his family did not redeem him, tore up the hostage and threw his body into the sea. The day before yesterday, Mr. Shi's family learned of the death of the head of the family, and they were very sad. They immediately set up an altar and mourned in Songjiang, while sending people to search for the whereabouts of the body.</p>
<h3>Special District Court to Hear Four Kidnapping Cases Today</h3>
<p>The case of Xi Lusheng, a comprador at HSBC, who was assassinated on December 6 of the year before last in front of Yizhixiang on Simalu Road, was not solved until December 10 of last year, when a large number of bandits were captured at the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Shi Jinde and Chen Baotai were identified as the murderers in the Xi case. Three trials have already been held, but all were adjourned because the evidence and witnesses were not yet complete. It is learned that this case has been scheduled for the fourth trial at 2:00 PM today in the Fifth Court of the Special District Court.

<h3>After Huang Chu-nine's Death, Inquiry Yesterday</h3>
<p>Board of Directors of Gongfa Company: After the death of Mr. Huang Chu-nine, his close friends have come forward to handle the aftermath, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the Gongfa Company convened a board meeting and resolved to issue a letter stating that the liquidation of the Day and Night Bank and all the recreation departments of the Great World was entrusted to the Huang Chu-nine Aftermath Handling Committee. Liquidators were appointed. The Aftermath Handling Committee is scheduled to convene a meeting today. Creditor Group to Hold General Meeting: Hua Dong She reported that since the death of the giant merchant Huang Chu-nine the day before, the Day and Night Bank and the Great World recreation savings department that he founded have been declared for liquidation by the Xu Yongzuo Accountant who was entrusted by the Aftermath Committee. However, because the creditors believe that the committee does not have a definite guarantee for the savings, some creditors organized a Creditor Group Preparatory Committee yesterday, while others entrusted lawyer Bian Jialu to convene all creditors to register their claims and negotiate legal remedies. The details are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>"Call for Meeting": Creditor Zhang Lin, in order to unite the creditors and make it easier to cope with the situation, convened all creditors at the Tongyuchun Tea House on Shilu Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the plan. About 300 creditors attended, and they elected Mr. Tian of Shanghai Law School as the chairman. However, because there were too many people and the tea house was too crowded with tea drinkers, there was a risk of danger. It was proposed to elect five representatives to negotiate with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to borrow the venue, while the rest would stay at the tea house for the time being. The five representatives immediately went to Mr. Chen, the secretary-general of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to request a loan, but Mr. Chen refused to lend it because the Standing Committee was not there and he could not be responsible. The five representatives were about to withdraw and report back when they learned that the creditors were coming one after another due to their vital interests. Mr. Chen had no choice but to temporarily approve it. Those present then announced the opening of the meeting and elected Zhu Ziping as chairman. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported that the declaration of liquidation of the Day and Night Bank had a huge impact on people's livelihood and society. However, whether the liquidation was legal and whether it could not harm the interests of creditors depended entirely on the creditors being united and strong to deal with it together in order to achieve satisfactory results. Later, the consensus was that the organizers should first register each claim and then elect a committee to prepare for the establishment after a considerable number was reached. Registration began immediately. At one time, about 300 households registered, totaling 100,000 yuan. As a result, it was recommended that representatives ask the Standing Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to temporarily lend an office, and the meeting would be held again after receiving a reply tomorrow. It was dispersed at 6:00 PM. "Entrusting a Lawyer": Some other creditors have entrusted lawyer Bian Jialu to convene all creditors to register at his office and organize a Creditor Group Preparatory Committee to negotiate legal remedies in order to ensure legal liquidation and protect the public interest. Yesterday, 300 people registered and joined, with a total amount of 200,000 yuan. It is also learned that the law firm has issued a notice to convene a meeting of the Creditor Group at the Central Western Restaurant on Simalu Road at 9:00 AM on the 25th of this month (Sunday) to discuss the way forward. According to the opinion of lawyer Bian Jialu, it is planned to protect human rights by law to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Investigation of Mr. Huang's Business: Huang Chu-nine operated a lot of businesses, the main one being Gongfa Company, including the Great World, Day and Night Bank, Hot Spring Bathhouse, Fuchang Tobacco Company, Chinese and Western Drug Store, and Five Institutions. The ones solely owned by him include Huang Jiuzhitang and Huang Longtai. The joint ventures include Jiufu Company and real estate companies. He also served as the chairman of the China-France Pharmacy Co., Ltd. In addition, it is difficult to count the real estate industries invested in or related to.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Holds Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council held its regular board meeting yesterday afternoon. The dog racing issue, which had already been resolved and banned, was not reconsidered yesterday despite the protests from Mingyuan and Shenyuan. The issue of the Municipal Council hiring Chinese to fill important administrative positions was only presented in a report by the Special Committee handling the bureau's issues. As for whether the title would be Chinese Director-General, Chinese Secretary-General, or official responsible for liaising with Chinese, it has not yet been decided. Dr. Wu Jingxiong is the most popular candidate. It is expected that he will be formally appointed after the title and position are decided. The rest of the issues discussed were routine matters for the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Public Buses Routes 1 and 3 Changed</h3>
<p>Effective February 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus, the Circular Road around the city, i.e., the route 3 circular road, has been praised by passengers for its convenience for the uptown carriage. For the downtown carriage, which had to pass through the French Concession section of the Republic Road, the company had repeatedly coordinated with the municipal authorities and the French Tram and Electric Light Company. It was planned to start operating on New Year's Day this year after several compromises were made. The start of operations was delayed to February 1 due to insufficient preparations. On the same day, the downtown carriage of route 1, starting from the old west gate station, will still follow Zhonghua Road, Wan Xiaodongmen, turn to the Bund, pass through the Local Office, and return to the old west gate. The uptown carriage, starting from the old west gate station, passing through the Local Office, turning to the Bund, Wan Xiaodongmen, and heading north, will change to follow Republic Road and return to the old west gate. From now on, passengers in the Dongjiadu area of Nanshi who want to enter the British and French concessions from Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, Zhengjia Muqiao, and Xinqiao Street will not have to change vehicles, which is more convenient than before. However, it is heard that the fares at each station have been slightly changed. To attract passengers, the company still sells tickets at the old west gate as before, and passengers can buy through tickets, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Elder Rockefeller's Condition Is Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>The Damei Evening News reported that the US telegrams recently reported that the elder Rockefeller was very ill, and his friends in this city were worried about him. According to a telegram from the elder Rockefeller's private residence in California received by the Dalae Company in this city on Tuesday night, the elder Rockefeller suffered from cystitis. After a minor surgery was performed by a doctor at his residence, the result was very good, and he will be able to return to the office within a week, it is said.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Ships Collide on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Extensive Damage Sustained</p>
<p>The British merchant firm Ewo Yuen Line's Glenapp, having recently arrived in Shanghai from England, collided with the American ship New York of the Andrews &amp; George Company on the Huangpu River while entering the port the day before yesterday. The circumstances of this incident are detailed below:</p>
<p>The British import vessel Glenapp entered the Huangpu River at 11:30 AM on the 20th. As it approached the fifth buoy, the Kailan Mining Administration's chartered Norwegian coal vessel Rowena was anchored there. The Glenapp attempted to maneuver around the Norwegian vessel and proceeded forward. Unexpectedly, the American ship New York, managed by Andrews &amp; George of this port, was simultaneously departing from the Huangpu River. The two ships converged, and before they could avoid each other, a collision occurred.</p>
<p>The American Ship Sustained Significant Damage. As the New York, managed by Andrews &amp; George, approached buoy number five, it saw the Glenapp approaching and attempted to avoid it. Its hull collided with the buoy. The impact was substantial, and the New York's starboard bow struck the Glenapp forcefully. A large hole was created in the outer starboard side of the forward hold, and the steel plating of the central hold was also severely dented. Water rushed into the forward hold, causing the New York's bow to immediately sink into the river. Fortunately, the central and aft holds were sealed off and did not flood, allowing the ship to remain afloat. However, the damage was extensive, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>Towed into the Dock for Repairs. The bow of the Glenapp was also damaged in the collision, though not as severely as the American ship. After the two ships collided, the Glenapp, unable to drop anchor, sailed past the fifth buoy and docked in front of the Taikoo Wharf. The shipowner inspected the extent of the damage and reported it to the Harbour Master's Office for investigation. In the afternoon, the American ship was towed to the Harmony Dock for repairs. The question of responsibility will be determined after an investigation. It is said that two Jardine Matheson ships in the river were nearly affected.</p>
<h3>Direct Telegraph Line Between Shanghai and Shenyang Now Open</h3>
<p>Shanghai, Fuzhou, Shantou, and Guangzhou Also Enjoy Improved Communication</p>
<p>Shenyang (formerly known as Fengtian) is the most prosperous commercial port in Northeast China. Normally, travel between Shanghai and Shenyang by boat or train takes no less than five or six days. Therefore, communication between Shanghai and Shenyang relies entirely on telegraphs. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, located on Sichuan Road in this port, acting upon instructions from the Ministry to promote Northeast trade and facilitate public convenience, has established a direct telegraph line between Shanghai and Shenyang. New-style booster machines have been installed in the Xuzhou and Tianjin bureaus. Since the 17th, direct communication between Shanghai and Shenyang has been available. Telegrams sent to the three northeastern provinces can arrive in just over ten minutes. Compared to the past, when telegrams had to be relayed through the Tianjin bureau, the speed has increased many times over. Furthermore, since the Fuzhou Bureau has taken back the Fuzhou borrowed line from the Great Northern Telegraph Company, the direct Shanghai-Fuzhou line has become even busier and more important. In addition, communication between Fuzhou and Shantou and between Fuzhou and Guangzhou is also smooth. As a result, the Shanghai-Fuzhou line has become even busier. In recent days, the bureau has been receiving and transmitting no fewer than two thousand telegrams daily from Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and the northeastern provinces due to the direct Shanghai-Shenyang line.</p>

(6) The estimated expenses for Mr. Liu's funeral will be distributed to each director. (7) Receipts will be prepared for all donations, and this will be clearly stated on the thank-you notes to ensure transparency. (8) Wu Chengyu (representative of Lao Tingguang) reported that he had been entrusted by Mr. Liu's family to provide legal assistance. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>One Explanation for the Tragic Death of Liu Rongtai</h3>
<p>Liu Rongtai, captain of the Zhabei Third District Fire Brigade, died on the evening of the 9th of this month at 11:00 PM when his car collided with a Jinghu Railway train at the Haichang Road level crossing. This incident has been reported previously. According to sources, the seventh Shanghai-Hangzhou express train passed the Haichang Road level crossing at 10:59 PM that night. Shortly thereafter, the twenty-second Jinghu Railway express train was approaching on the parallel track. The two trains were approximately five railway tracks apart. At that time, the south side gate of the level crossing was still closed, with a red signal light indicating danger in both directions. The north side gate had been damaged by an armored car and was being removed for repairs by the Road Engineering Department. A rope was temporarily used, with one end tied to the gate post and the other end held by a gatekeeper to prevent vehicles, horses, and pedestrians from entering the tracks. The railway gatekeeper at the level crossing saw the car approaching and, disregarding the red light signal, rushed forward. He immediately shouted to stop and used a red signal lantern to indicate danger. The local police officer also shouted to assist. However, the captain thought that the express train had already passed and that there would not be another one immediately following it. He ignored the sound of the train, the shouts of the gatekeeper, and the red signal light. He sped through the rope and onto the tracks, colliding with engine C25 of the Jinghu twenty-second express train. The car was completely destroyed, and the captain suffered fatal injuries to his head and internal organs. It is said that the captain's death was due to his rushing and taking risks in the line of duty, and those who heard of it were saddened.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Coal Gas Poisoning Death</h3>
<p>He Zisheng and Lin Jisheng, natives of Qidong, jointly owned a coal-carrying vessel. They hired a fellow villager, Yang Zizheng, as the captain. Yang Zizheng then hired Yang Zilun and Gu Ruilin as crew members. The ship was loading coal at the Zhonghua Pier in Pudong the night before last. As the evening grew colder, Yang Zizheng and the others, unable to bear the cold, used two pots of coal (which they did not have to pay for) to light a stove for warmth. They drank wine and enjoyed themselves, becoming intoxicated. Tragically, their joy turned to sorrow. The coal contained toxic substances, and the fumes clouded their senses, leading to the deaths of Yang Zizheng, Yang Zilun, and Gu Ruilin. The shipowners learned of this yesterday morning and reported it to the local court. Prosecutor Li conducted a preliminary investigation and ordered the three bodies to be taken to the South Pier Rescue Bureau. He then visited the scene with the coroner and determined that the deceased had all vomited rice and were in a very tragic state. He concluded that they had died of poisoning and ordered the bodies to be claimed for coffining and burial.</p>
<h3>Ma Dunhe Hat Shop Opens Branch</h3>
<p>Ma Dunhe Hat Shop, located at the corner of Wangping Street on Second Avenue in this port, is a thriving business and a leader in the industry. Its high-quality products and innovative designs have long been renowned. Recently, to expand its scope, it opened a branch at No. 217-218 Wangping Street, at the north end of Second Avenue. The renovation work has been completed, and business has commenced, which prevents customers from being too crowded.</p>
<h3>Sequel to French Concession Business Opposing Tax Increase</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council Has Suspended the Tax Increase</p>
<p>Notice from the Guild of Businesses to Members</p>
<p>The French Concession's inns were suddenly notified of a tax increase of two cents per room per month, starting in January of this year, from the original tax of four cents per room per month. The innkeepers were not informed in advance, and the tax collectors of the French Municipal Council only verbally notified them of the increase during collection. The innkeepers felt that this was difficult to sustain because their businesses were declining and they only had a few lodgers, most of whom were commoners with limited means. Therefore, they unanimously opposed the Municipal Council's tax increase and reported it to the French Concession Innkeepers Guild to negotiate. After receiving the reports from the members, the Guild convened an emergency meeting and decided to unanimously reject the tax increase, and it also decided on four measures, the details of which were reported earlier. It is now reported that the French Municipal Council is in the process of discussing the tax increase, so officials have been ordered to temporarily suspend the collection of the tax increase. In addition to the Guild's public nomination of representatives to visit the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, Nua Wei Wei, and other Chinese directors to ask for assistance, the Guild issued a notice to its members yesterday, which is listed below. Notice is hereby given, on the basis of claims made by various members at the meeting, that the French Municipal Council must increase the room tax from four cents to two cents starting in January of this year, which is difficult for everyone to bear, and requesting that the Association negotiate to cancel the tax increase in order to reduce the burden, etc. Based on this, after investigation, the committee of this Association decided that the situation of the industry does not allow for the donation and decided on four measures to negotiate with the French Municipal Council to achieve the purpose of cancellation, in the case. All our member businesses must abide by this and wait for a solution. This notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>The Central National Medical Institute Continues to Appoint Promoters</h3>
<p>Dr. Yan Cangshan of Pu Bai Road in this port recently received a letter from the Central National Medical Institute, inviting him to be a promoter of the Institute. Dr. Yan has long been renowned in Shanghai. He previously presided over medical affairs at the Shanghai Siming Hospital and founded the Chinese Medical College and the Family Medical Advisory Society. He currently serves as an executive supervisor of the National Medical Association and the Shanghai National Medical Association. His knowledge and experience are both extensive and abundant. Dr. Yan has already replied to the letter accepting the appointment and will make significant contributions to the development of the National Medical Institute in the future.</p>
<h3>Financial Report of Qianyi Hospital</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the annual medical services of the Lanzi Ten Association Qianyi Trauma Specialist Hospital have been developing daily. This year's diagnosis and treatment have been especially busy. The hospital's report for the 19th year has now been printed. According to the report, approximately 40,000 people registered, and approximately 20,000 unregistered people were introduced by various organizations, directors, companies, and factories. In terms of income, the registration fee was 5,061.80 yuan, the accommodation fee was 3,367 yuan, Qin Runqing, as a director, received 4,396 yuan from various philanthropists. Du Yuesheng, as a director, received 300 yuan per month in rent, totaling 3,600 yuan. Mr. Zhang Deyi received 600 yuan in travel expenses from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. Mr. Zhang Deyi received 800 yuan from wedding congratulatory gifts, totaling 17,824.80 yuan. In terms of expenditure, the total expenditure was 19,617.38 yuan. The income and expenditure offset each other, resulting in a net overdraft of 1,792.58 yuan. Since its opening, the hospital has accumulated a debt of 15,678.058 yuan. Shanghai's hospitals are numerous, and it is rare to find a hospital whose medical services are developing rapidly. Furthermore, the hospital's expenses are minimal, while its effects are significant. Healing broken bones is not only appreciated by the individual patient, but also ensures the safety of the entire family's livelihood. Remembering this merit and virtue, it is the enthusiastic support of the hospital's major directors that has made this possible.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Dr. Tang's Lawsuit Against His Wife</h3>
<p>Reopening of the Investigation Court Today</p>
<p>Dr. Tang Huixuan (also known as Tang Chongci, also known as Wu'an), an economics Ph.D., sued his wife, Zou Aizhen, and her "sworn brother," Chen Genwei, in the local court for adultery, initiating a private prosecution. The first instance court ruled the defendant not guilty. Tang appealed, and the second instance court examined the regulations for private prosecution and found that a lawsuit could not be filed against a relative. Therefore, the original judgment was overturned, and Tang Huixuan's prosecution was rejected for failing to meet the procedural requirements. The case was then transferred to the Procuratorate. Prosecutor Wu Shixin accepted the case and scheduled a preliminary hearing in the investigation court for today.</p>
<h3>Gao Xiangwen Asks to Terminate Engagement</h3>
<p>Engagement for Eight Years with No News</p>
<p>Fiancé Cannot Be Contacted</p>
<p>Gao Xiangwen, a woman from Anhui, was promised in marriage to Wu Guangting's son, Zonghao, when she was one year old, with Wu Cai acting as matchmaker. Xiangwen initially did not know about this. The Wu family has had no communication since the betrothal, and eight years have passed without any attempt to take her as a wife. Xiangwen recently learned that her fiancé has taken another woman as a concubine, which is tantamount to a disavowal of the engagement. Xiangwen feels that she is getting older and will soon be thirty, and that it is pointless to remain unmarried. Therefore, she hired lawyer Ni Jiong to file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court to terminate this engagement, so she can seek happiness in life. A lost corner may still be recovered. The court accepted the complaint and issued a summons to the defendant, ordering him to appear in court for questioning. However, no one knows where Wu Zonghao is, and the summons could not be delivered. Therefore, the previous hearing could not proceed. The hearing was rescheduled for yesterday morning, but the defendant still did not appear. Judge Yang then ordered that a public notice be issued before scheduling another hearing.</p>
<h3>Divorce Case of a Woman in Beiping</h3>
<p>Adjournment for Attempted Reconciliation</p>
<p>Cui Pu, a woman from Beiping who is thirty years old, became engaged to Zhang Shuyuan in the former capital in 1917. They married on April 20 of the following year. However, Zhang was addicted to wine and women and gambling. Cui Pu repeatedly tried to correct him, but this only led to further discord between them. Later, Zhang wanted to take a job in a certain institution in Qingdao. Cui Pu accompanied him, but Zhang continued to pursue extramarital affairs. Cui Pu was jealous, which only worsened their relationship. Before long, Zhang's job in Qingdao was terminated. Zhang went to Shanghai alone, while Cui returned to her mother's home in Tianjin. Last month, Zhang sent a letter to his wife proposing a divorce. His words were extremely resolute, vowing that they must separate. After reading the letter, Cui felt that they were already an unhappy couple and that being together would only cause them more pain. Separation would preserve their future happiness. Therefore, she went to Shanghai and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court, requesting a divorce and demanding that the defendant pay 30,000 yuan in alimony and bear the litigation costs. Judge Zhou Daren held a hearing yesterday, but the defendant, Zhang Shuda, did not appear. His lawyer raised a jurisdictional objection, requesting that the issue of jurisdiction be decided first. He said that if the court determined that it had jurisdiction over the case, the defendant would be ordered to appear at the next hearing. Judge Zhou stated that the plaintiff and defendant had been husband and wife for more than ten years. Why should they seek a divorce and even resort to legal proceedings because of occasional disagreements? This went against the principle that husband and wife should respect each other. He urged the plaintiff to attempt reconciliation out of court. Plaintiff's lawyer Chen Tingrui stated that the case was not absolutely beyond hope and that there might still be room for mediation if given sufficient time. The court then agreed to postpone the hearing to allow the parties to attempt reconciliation.</p>
<h3>Fallen Flower Eagerly Awaiting Settlement</h3>
<p>Wan Sujin Handed Over to Her Uncle for Collection</p>
<p>Wan Sujin, a girl from Yushan who is only seventeen years old, came to Shanghai with her mother last summer. She then went to Suzhou and lived with her uncle, Qu Tianyi. Qu's neighbor, a tailor named Gui Sheng, was flirtatious. The girl, who was already aware of such things, had illicit relations with him. Later, knowing that her mother was still in Shanghai, he told her that he would be going to Shanghai and could take her there. The girl followed Gui Sheng back to Shanghai, but he took her to Xiamen and sold her into a brothel. She suffered greatly from then on. Two months ago, she finally escaped. She went to the Xiamen wharf, intending to take a ship to Shanghai. Unfortunately, the ship had already departed. The girl was wandering aimlessly, crying. A police officer from the local Municipal Council found her and took her to the police station. After learning the cause, he sent a telegram to Shanghai, asking the police to investigate her mother's address. However, they could not find it. They telegraphed back to the Xiamen Municipal Council, asking them to send the girl to Shanghai and temporarily place her in the Jiliang Institute. It has been a long time since she arrived, and she urgently needs to be settled. Yesterday morning, the police sent the girl to the Special District Local Court. After Judge Zhou Han inquired about the details, he ordered that she be temporarily placed in the Jiliang Institute and that her uncle, Qu Tianyi, be notified to claim her so that they could be reunited.</p>

The Chinese and Western officials sentenced the defendant to two months in a Western prison as a warning and revoked his license, permanently banning him from driving again.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Bureau Orders Restrictions on Elementary School Students Performing Songs and Dances</h3>
<p>Order No. 90 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education stipulates that the number of performances of songs and dances must comply with the limits set by the Ministry, and the scope of songs and dances must also comply with the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry. The order is directed to the Education Bureaus of various counties. Recently, reports from various sources indicate that elementary schools in Jiangsu Province often have lengthy performances of songs and dances in their meetings of request, memorial meetings, and celebration meetings, as well as during recreational festivals. Some even participate in private gatherings. The drawbacks of such performances of songs and dances are as follows: (1) The performances of songs and dances take up a great deal of time and cause the children to sing and dance excessively, often to the point of sweating, panting, and becoming hoarse. Moreover, the purpose of these performances is merely to entertain the audience. Participation in private gatherings turns the children into entertainment objects, which hinders their physical and mental development and violates the purpose of education. (2) Songs and dances are easily praised, so elementary school students tend to focus on singing and dancing while neglecting the basic curriculum. Moreover, because the time is so long, there is actually no time left to study other subjects. This not only fosters vanity in elementary school students but also indirectly causes their academic performance to decline. The singing in elementary schools was originally intended to cultivate temperament, while dancing was a tool for activating the body. Therefore, the elementary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry stipulate that music should not be used with simplified musical notation at will, and dance is limited to social dance and similar forms. The songs and dances mentioned above are almost like the performances of song and dance troupes, which should of course be restricted according to the physical condition of the children. The Ministry of Education issued an order last year stipulating that elementary schools should not perform songs and dances more than twice per year. This order is hereby reiterated. Hereafter, all elementary schools must comply with the number of performances set by the Ministry and the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry. In addition to issuing separate orders, the Director is requested to instruct the principals of affiliated schools to pay attention to this order.</p>
<h3>Graduates of Unregistered Private Schools Cannot Continue Their Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Refutes the Admission Qualifications of Yenching University New Students</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education refuted the admission qualifications of Yenching University's new students for the 19th year (because there were graduates from unregistered private schools). The Ministry of Education issued an order to the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau stating that it approved the Beijing Private Yenching University's report that it must submit its list of new students recruited each year for review and approval. The university reported that it has recruited 128 first-year students and 35 transfer students of various grades for the 19th year, along with their names, ages, native places, and graduation or attendance certificates. The report was respectfully submitted for review and approval, along with the relevant tables and certificates to the Ministry. Article 20 of the University Organization Law stipulates that university admission qualifications require graduation from a public or registered private high school or equivalent school and passing the entrance examination, which was announced in July of the 18th year and repeatedly notified and warned. Among the new students of the university, there are nine students, including Zhao Shanyin, who graduated from unregistered private schools. They should be ordered to withdraw from school to comply with the regulations. The rest are approved for filing without any discrepancies. The certificate is issued, and it is ordered that it be followed.</p>
<h3>Certificates of Attendance and Academic Level of Transfer Students</h3>
<p>Are Based on the Original School's Standards</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau asking whether it is feasible to order that primary and secondary schools not accept transfer students in the final year, then issued an order from the Ministry of Education stating that it was familiar with the report. Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations for Middle Schools stipulates that transfer students must have the same subjects of study and overlapping semesters. Their certificates of attendance from the original school must be accepted if they pass the placement examination at the beginning of the semester, without other restrictions. The provision in the report stating that primary and secondary schools should not accept transfer students in the final year should not be stipulated. It should be followed immediately.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Sino-Japanese Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Mr. Masaki Naohiko and Others in Shanghai and Hangzhou for Negotiations</p>
<p>The Exhibition of Ancient Paintings from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties and the Sino-Japanese Modern Painting Exhibition will be held in Tokyo, Japan from April 26th to May 20th, and in Osaka from May 23rd to 30th. The Japanese side has sent Masaki Naohiko, president of the Tokyo University of the Arts, and the painter Watanabe Seimyo to China to negotiate. The second discussion meeting was held at Wang Yiting's residence at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, and the discussion on the issues of exhibits and transportation was very satisfactory. It is reported that Mr. Masaki and Mr. Watanabe were accompanied by the calligrapher Wang Yachen to Hangzhou yesterday morning to solicit exhibits from famous collectors in the area and to tour the scenic West Lake. They are scheduled to stay in Hangzhou for three days and return to Shanghai on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Request to Revise the Medical Education System by Graduates of Suzhou Medical College (2)</h3>
<p>Furthermore, all academics are divided into two paths: research and practical application. Practical application is for current needs, while research seeks academic progress. Medicine is the same. Medical colleges emphasize research, while medical vocational schools focus on practical application. This is the intention of the Ministry of Education, which does not allow medical vocational schools to be established independently. The concern is that if too many medical vocational schools are established, everyone will rush to the practical application route and neglect research. However, this is not the case. Historically, the only three medical vocational schools in the country, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Ping, graduate a total of no less than one or two hundred students each year. Not only do they serve in various political and military circles throughout the country and enjoy a deep reputation, but after completing their studies, they also go abroad for further study, accumulating research results and obtaining medical doctorate degrees from various countries. There are many such examples, which sufficiently demonstrate that although the establishment of medical vocational schools aims to cultivate practical medical talents, there has never been a restriction on research and further study. It can be asserted that it will not necessarily hinder academic progress in the future. As for the concern that domestic medicine is still in its infancy and lacks teachers, which prevents the independent establishment of medical vocational schools, this is even more unreasonable. Although scientific medicine in our country is only about 30 years old, we certainly feel the lack of teachers to guide future generations in the study of academic theories. However, if the sole purpose is to cultivate practical talents, looking around the medical field, the required instructors can still be supplied with a surplus. It may be justifiable to restrict the establishment of medical colleges due to the lack of teachers in research, but even then, it feels like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It is even more incomprehensible to restrict medical vocational schools based on this reason. Members of this association are scattered throughout the country, serving society, and deeply feel this point based on their limited knowledge. Last New Year's Day, the association convened an annual meeting in the capital. It was noted that Jiangsu Province lacks practical medical talents, which is insufficient to meet the needs of society. A written request was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to restore the old medical schools. The Department of Education did not act on it because it could not change the established case. Looking back to the present, a year has passed. Due to financial constraints, no new medical colleges have been added. Seeking a second-best option, the establishment of medical vocational schools is again restricted by the Ministry's order. It is difficult to supplement the well-thought-out considerations of the authorities regarding medical talents, which is well-known. Jiangsu's education has always been known for its development, and it is still like this, let alone other provinces and cities. Now, the association is convening its annual meeting in Shanghai. After discussing academics, all members feel that China's weakness stems from the unhealthiness of its people. The unhealthiness of the people is due to the underdevelopment of sanitation, and the underdevelopment of sanitation is due to the lack of practical medical materials. There are too few schools cultivating medical materials, all of which are caused by the current medical education system of the Ministry of Education, which is a fundamental obstacle to our country's efforts to become strong. Therefore, we respectfully submit these humble opinions, hoping that they will be adopted and the Ministry of Education will be instructed to revise the old medical education system. In addition to medical colleges, medical vocational schools should be allowed to be established independently to widely cultivate talents and assist in sanitary construction, etc. (omitted below) (The End)</p>

<h3>Northeast Wins Three Battles in a Row</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Northeast defeated John's 54 to 26.</p>
<p>| Will fight Laoda tomorrow night at 7 PM |</p>
<p>The Northeast University basketball team first defeated Hujiang, then Qingguang, and yesterday defeated John's 54 to 26. Their radiance is boundless, and their dominance is clear. The Shanghai basketball teams cannot help but feel disheartened. Tomorrow night at 7 PM, they will face Laoda.</p>
<h3>The Great Battle Begins Amidst Applause</h3>
<p>Last night, many people came to watch, drawn by the team's reputation. At 7 PM, the athletes of both teams entered the arena with vigorous strides, practicing in their respective zones, either throwing from afar, or shooting from close range, or shooting from the side, or striking at an angle, each with their own approach, displaying their skills. After a long time, the time had arrived. Everything was ready except for the referee. Suddenly, thunderous applause and cheers erupted, signaling the arrival of referee Zhang Guo-xun, who issued the mobilization order, and the great battle began.</p>
<h3>Intelligence Meets Skill, Neither Side Gives Way</h3>
<p>Both sides have been trained by famous coaches, and their throwing, passing, and defending are all deliberate, not wasting any opportunities or strength. John took the lead with Pang Ying's free throw, scoring one point. Northeast's Yuan Ting-rui reached into the basket with both hands, scoring two points. John then scored another point with Lin Ze-qun's free throw, tying the score. Northeast's Tian Xin-yuan attacked from the side, successfully scoring, taking the lead with a score of 4 to 2. John relied on Ying Qiao-shu's one point and Lin Ze-qun's one goal to turn defeat into victory. In an instant, Tian Xin-yuan scored a long shot, and Northeast took the lead again. From then on, their momentum grew unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Northeast Greatly Benefits from Displaying Power</h3>
<p>Yuan Ting-rui stood out, moving freely and contributing significantly. Within five minutes, he scored three goals, plus Tian Xin-yuan's one goal, the score widened significantly. John immediately replaced players to reorganize, but under the opponent's strong momentum, the gains were limited, while the losses were alarming. In the first half, Northeast had 22 points and John had 8 points.</p>
<h3>John Submits Under Remaining Momentum</h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, John's Chen Xiang-long dribbled quickly, shooting upwards under the basket, with nine out of ten attempts missing by a hair's breadth. Ma Bing-jun, seeing the enemy unprepared, ambushed under the basket and succeeded. One gain and one loss, it was as if fate was in control. Zhao Ling-zhi went straight down the middle, achieving his wish, and then tried a long shot, which was also successful. Although John's Hou Xue-min regained a goal, the situation remained depressed. Tian Yuan broke into the enemy's formation and scored successively. The back and forth, the harmony, ultimately led to John's submission, with no chance to raise their heads. In the second half, Northeast had 32 points and John had 18 points. The final score was 54 to 26, with Northeast winning by a large margin.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>A Laughing Matter Hai Ke</p>
<p>Seven-year-old daughter (at a relative's house, tired of listening to her mother constantly talking to relatives): Mommy, let's go home.</p>
<p>Mother: Don't be naughty. Wait a little longer.</p>
<p>Seven-year-old daughter: Mommy, let's go home.</p>
<p>Mother: Child, don't you know manners? You can't interrupt when elders are talking. You have to wait until we're finished talking before you can say anything.</p>
<p>Seven-year-old daughter: But you never finish talking. When will I get to say anything?</p>
<p>A: I've recently finished writing a novel, and I'm very proud of it.</p>
<p>B: Another great work, I presume?</p>
<p>A: I wouldn't presume to call it great, but the reason I write novels isn't just for money. It's really to benefit the reader's mind and body.</p>
<p>B: That's absolutely right. Your novels are indeed beneficial to people's minds and bodies. Last time I read your novel, it cured my insomnia. I only read a few pages for three nights in a row, and I fell asleep.</p>
<p>Child: Mommy, what does "angel" mean?</p>
<p>Mother: It's a beautiful fairy in heaven.</p>
<p>Child: Do angels have wings?</p>
<p>Mother: Yes, they have two wings.</p>
<p>Child: If they have wings, they must be able to fly. So when will our little brother's nanny grow wings? When will she fly? Because I heard Daddy call her "angel" last night.</p>
<p>Mother: Really? Then I'll tell her to fly tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Mr. Weng Wenhao's Talk on Sichuan Geology</h3>
<p>Li Xiefei</p>
<p>Mr. Weng Wenhao, Director of the Geological Survey of Beiping, recently returned to the capital after surveying the geology of Sichuan. The Geology Department of Zhongda University invited him to give a lecture. Mr. Weng, having traveled thousands of miles and covered in dust, ascended the podium immediately after unloading his luggage. His spirit of serving the country and pursuing knowledge is truly admirable. (The following records Mr. Weng's words)</p>
<p>Itinerary: I entered Sichuan from Yichang, followed the river to Chongqing, and then entered Chengdu from Hechuan in the north. On the return journey, I followed the western route to Jiading, circled Mount Emei, crossed Zigong, and returned to Chongqing, exiting Sichuan along the original route.</p>
<p>Basin: Sichuan is said to be a basin, and people often describe it as such. However, it is not that simple, as it contains numerous small anticlinal strata, separated into numerous basins. Going upstream, the geological structure is clearly visible. The synclinal strata in between mostly belong to the Cretaceous period, are red in color, and are loose, so they cannot form high mountains. The anticlinal strata mostly belong to the Jurassic period, are insoluble and solid, and therefore form towering cliffs. The older Triassic period also forms relatively high mountains. The limestone period produces even higher mountains. The old saying that the topography of Sichuan is very new is a superficial observation. In reality, the effects of structure and erosion are equally powerful. I still find it difficult to distinguish between them, but I cannot help but doubt the words of my predecessors.</p>
<p>River Journey: The Sichuan basin is visible from western Hubei. I took a brief look, making it difficult to grasp the essentials. Fortunately, previous investigators have provided very detailed surveys. From northwestern Hubei to southwestern Sichuan, I did not have to trek. Instead, I could lean back on the deck and still learn something. They labored, and I rested, so I am grateful to my predecessors. Past Yichang, the small mountains stretch for dozens of miles, formed by limestone, dating back to the Tertiary period. This is the Yichang Gorge, with beautiful scenery. The mountains are about 700 meters high, with towering peaks that constrict the river to a half-mile waist. It is a magnificent sight. Further inland, the mountains are flat, and the river is wide, creating a beautiful topography. There is a gorge upstream called the Niufei Fenggan Gorge (the limestone has dissolved to form stalactites, colored like beef lungs and horse liver). It is precipitous, like the Yichang Gorge. Further up is the Micang Gorge, all formed by steeply elevated limestone. Inside is Zigui County, the hometown of Qu Yuan. These three gorges are known as the Guizhou Three Gorges, a magnificent landscape.</p>
<p>Wushan Gorge: Further west is the Wushan Gorge, which is more majestic than what was encountered earlier, rising from 1,000 meters to 1,300 meters. The high mountains and cliffs extend uninterrupted for 120 miles. The river narrows to only 200 meters. Plants do not grow on the cliffs. Ancient poems speak of the Twelve Peaks of Wushan, but in reality, the high mountains on both banks form thousands of peaks, not just twelve.</p>
<p>Wushan County is the first county to enter Sichuan. Beyond one gorge is the Qutang Gorge. Previous researchers have limited their studies to this point. Ahead, there is a large stone called Yan Yu Dui. Limestone fallen into the river has not yet been completely eroded. It lies horizontally in the river, making navigation difficult. Once inside Kuimen, one sees Kuifu (Fengjie). This place has important mineral resources: salt, gypsum, oil, coal gas, mirabilite, which are the most important.</p>
<p>Salt Rock: Looking down from the railing, the salt color is visible. The river water evaporates and condenses into crystals. Every summer, when the river water rises sharply, the residents block the low-lying areas, preventing water from returning east. In late autumn, when the trees wither, and the water level drops suddenly, what was previously trodden becomes salt fields today.</p>
<p>Once the river turns inside Kuifu, the river flow suddenly turns, running parallel to the mountain range. Therefore, the mountain strata seen are almost identical. However, the shallow, gentle beauty is still worth seeing. Horizontal branches overhang, and exotic flowers hide diagonally, making the scenery different from before. As you approach Fuzhou, you see limestone of the same quality as that which created the gorges. The geological strata rise suddenly. From Yichang to Chongqing, Yichang, Nantuo, Guizhou, Wuxia, Wushan, and Qutang are all anticlinal strata, narrow and dangerous. Fuzhou is a synclinal stratum, wide and flat.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes of the Ice Lake</h3>
<p>Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Taihu Lake is 36,000 acres in size, with a vast expanse of water, making it a large body of water in the southeast. However, after the snow a few days ago, it actually froze solid, a sheet of glass, like a large round mirror, placed flat against the sky. It is a wondrous sight. Today, the weather has been clear for several days. A friend who came from Meiyuan told me that the lake ice has not yet thawed. It is so thick in places, frozen to seven or eight inches, that it does not melt easily. Therefore, the situation on the lake is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The lake is rich in aquatic products such as fish and shrimp. The restaurants along the lake, from the Taihu Hotel in Meiyuan to Rongxiang, are all supplied by the lake. Now that the lake surface is frozen, the fishermen cannot cast their nets, so the source of fish has been cut off. Even if you pay a high price, you cannot get any. In general, gourmets raise their chopsticks and lament the lack of fish. However, the lives of aquatic creatures are largely preserved.</p>
<p>White gulls and wild ducks gather in flocks, freely appearing and disappearing. They usually call the water home, and countless numbers are found on the lake. Now, they cannot return home and have nothing to eat because of the solid ice. There is no way to retrieve things from the water. Starving for days, skinny and lonely, they perch on the ice, waiting to die, making them easy prey for hunters. Many children go to catch them, as easily as taking something out of a bag. Two pairs of mandarin ducks were obtained and sold to Meiyuan. Mr. Wu, a friend of mine who is in charge of the garden, raises them carefully for display. The loving couples, though startled and broken by the cold in their gentle homeland, remain together in their new home. Compared to the plight of the gulls and ducks, they are much luckier.</p>
<p>Taihu Lake lies between Wu and Yue. Water transportation has always been important. Now navigation has stopped. The largest Xihu steamboat is frozen in the lake, and the other smaller scheduled boats are also unable to operate. Merchants and travelers are greatly inconvenienced. However, there are many bandits in the lake. Their livelihood is waterborne, and small boats are their weapons. It is said that their work has also been hampered by the ice. Generally, they stay in their nests and eat what they have stored, so the wind of robbery has subsided. At this time, the residents along the lake are able to enjoy the pleasure of gathering around the stove and sleeping peacefully. This is a gift from the frozen earth and snow, so they have no time to lament the bitter cold.</p>
<h3>A Brief Review of Wang Shaolou's New Records</h3>
<p>Shi Seng</p>
<p>After Wang Shaolou returned north, people in Beijing and Shanghai felt a sense of regret at his departure. Coincidentally, the Great China Record Company has recently released five new records of Shaolou's best pieces. I specially purchased them from the Desheng Company to listen to his elegant voice and was delighted by their excellence. I will describe them below for those who love Shaolou's music.</p>
<p>Of the five records, "Fighting Taiping" is the best. In the "Biejia" section, the "Dapao" two words in the Xipi Yaoban uses a Gadu, and the "Yixiang" and "Zhentiantidi" two arias both use Wawa, making it resound through the clouds. The recording is clear and not harsh, exceptionally sharp. The virtual sound of the word "Di" is bright and round, a special skill of the Yu school. In the sentence "Jiao Hua An Yu Wei Fu Dai Zuo Qi," he uses a high pitch again, with plenty to spare. The crying aria in the sentence "Da Furen Qing Shang Shou Yi Li" is sad and moving. This section deeply captures the meaning of the words "tragic" and "heroic." It shines alongside Lao Tan's Xipi and Shu Shi's Erhuang. It is indeed rare to find a male actor with this voice and style today. The Liushui Yaoban crying aria in the second section, "Nao Zhang," deserves the evaluation of "concise and vigorous." Many people have recorded the "Wei Kai Yan" section of "Silang Tanmu," and Luo Xiaobao is the best, but the lack of the two Yaoban, "Wo Ben Shi Yang Silang," is a flaw. Shaolou's performance of this play is famous in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and this section is especially enjoyable and complete, without any regrets. Therefore, it is worthy of praise. The second section is the complete lyrics of "Being Captured and Seeing His Brother." The high singing "Da He Yi Sheng..." soars into the clouds. The words in the two Kuaiban sections are all pearls. The dragging and clean strength of the section "Diongmen Fenbie" is full of flavor. After Shu Yan and Ju Peng promoted "Fa Chang Huan Zi," it became popular in the north and south. Ju Peng has a good section of Fan Erhuang Sanyan. Shaolou continues it now. Starting with the Fan Erhuang Yuanban from "Yin Ci Shang Xue Men Zhong...", this sentence is surging, and the momentum is very majestic. The slow release and meandering of the sentence "Zai Yang He" is uniquely spectacular. The Fan Erhuang Yaoban of the sentence "Ma Furen Wo Bu Bian Chan Ni..." is restrained. The "Dan Deng Na Dapao Xiang..." is extremely tragic. In "Baolian Deng," the section "Wo Ben Dang" is closely linked to the familiar "Xi Ri Li." There are two crying arias in the middle, which are unique and innovative, and not found in other Erhuang Yuanban. In "Famen Si," the "Meiwu County" is present in Ju Peng's version, but lacks the last sentence. Even Lian Liang is not a common thing to play. The lyrics and tune feel strange. Shaolou's version has a new tune and a rich flavor. The entire section is complete, which caters to the preferences of record lovers. The frequent appearance of beautiful tunes in Erliu is also a unique highlight. The dimensions of Zhuo Fang Su Dian's Erhuang Manban are suitable for slow movements. Shaolou's performance of this play is rich in mood, which shows how good it is. All five records are excellent. Shaolou has achieved this at a young age, which is enough to be proud of.</p>
<h3>Parisian Tales (10)</h3>
<p>Six Zeng Kisses in Paris</p>
<p>(1) An Argentine Friend</p>
<p>"An Argentine Friend" (Une amie Argentine) is a four-act comedy co-written by the popular comedy master, Tristan Bernard (his son Jean-Jacques Bernard is also a very famous playwright in France today), and Max Maurey. Tristan Bernard's works are almost all the most accurate portrayals of modern society. His observations of human nature are extremely profound. The dialogue is light and full of satire. He scolds people but still makes them laugh. His works have great appeal because they suit everyone's tastes. Every performance is sold out. Although "An Argentine Friend" is said to be a collaboration with Maurey, Bernard's style is still largely preserved. The plot is bizarre and changeable, going through many twists and turns before finally returning to a perfect ending. This is a common feature of popular comedies in Paris today.</p>
<p>After reading it, this is the plot of the comedy "An Argentine Friend." A widower named Le Vernot lives with his daughter, Allez. Le Vernot is considered a loving father, but his bad habit is that he likes to frequent racetracks and clubs. He is far less sharp and strong-willed than his daughter. Allez and her cousin, a mediocre man named Gaston, are in love with each other. When the two families gather at Le Vernot's home to decide on the wedding date for Allez and Gaston, Gaston's mother, after hearing that the price of a certain stock on the stock exchange has fallen sharply, and that Le Vernot is in danger of bankruptcy, suddenly expresses dissent to the decision of the wedding date for Allez and Gaston, and proposes that Gaston first go to the United States to avoid it, and then hold the wedding when he returns. Although Gaston is unwilling, he dares not disobey his mother's orders, and can only weep.</p>
<p>Soon, Le Vernot went bankrupt and moved with Allez to a small house, in great poverty. But his habit of being stubborn has not changed at all. Fortunately, Allez is very brave. She finds a position in a bank and saves money by tightening her belt to give to her father to squander. She realizes that she cannot marry her beloved cousin in her current situation. At this time, her aunt is also looking for opportunities to sabotage the marriage of Allez and her son. Allez, in order to obey fate, voluntarily breaks the engagement. She pretends that she no longer loves her cousin. When Gaston runs over to accuse her, she tells him to his face that she no longer wants to marry him. In fact, she is very bitter inside.</p>
<p>One starry morning, when Le Vernot went to the racetrack, Allez at home suddenly had an unfamiliar guest come to visit. This is an old astronomer who has just returned from the Republic of Argentina in South America. He worked there as the director of the observatory founded by the wealthy Mr. Probatz.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: Skillful Preservation of Youthful Appearance; Cui Dai Mixes Eyebrows; No Way to Continue Life; The Golden Market Buys the Bones of a Fine Horse</p>
<p>Ren Peizhen said, "Have you been to the north? I think the places you have been to are still the prosperous areas of the north, probably Beijing, Tianjin, or Jinan. You can't see those poor old people there. Moreover, in recent years, Beijing has also improved, unlike before." Old Lin Daiyu said, "I went to the north very early, during the Boxer Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, didn't I? Weren't you already in the north?" Zuo Shichen said, "That's right, later people even wrote a play about you called 'Lin Daiyu Flees from Disaster,' saying that you were following some senior brother, fleeing around together. Is that true or not?" Old Lin Daiyu said, "What reason do those playwrights have? If there is even a little bit of a reason, they will say it as if it were true. I myself am someone who has been in plays, and I know the temperament of those playwrights. It is strange, but it is also difficult to blame them, otherwise it wouldn't be like a play, it must be drawn from all directions, so that it would be like a play. People want to see it. That play 'Lin Huoyu Flees from Hardship' is nothing more than describing the situation of the Boxer Rebellion, a new topical play, and I was made the master in the play, which is also my bad luck." Long Ziyun said, "At that time, you couldn't protest and forbid them from doing it? There must be many places in that play where they are making fun of you." Old Lin Daiyu said, "Of course, they wrote a play about me, what good would idle talk do? Long Fourth Young Master, you say that I can negotiate with them? I am someone who eats from a tangzi, how can I stand up to the theater owner? However they want to write it, they can only write it however they want. Speaking of which, you business people don't care about this, putting your name in large letters, hanging at the entrance of the theater, isn't that praising you? Originally, I knew most of the theater owners, and I said, 'Don't you all spoil people so much, also take care of</p>
<p>other people's reputation.' They said, 'Please forgive me, Mr. Lin. Our play, scenery and costumes, all cost a good thousand pieces, to make a change would be like a competition, we would be silenced. Once it is broadcast, it is over.' Long Ziyun said, "Although people borrowed your name to write a play, in order to describe the situation of the Boxer Rebellion, then it is not without</p>
<p>a basis. Then, did you recognize their senior brother and second senior brother?" Old Lin Daiyu said, "Recognize, I recognize one or two. As for saying that I followed them to run, that is not true. If I said that, wouldn't I have become one of the red lanterns in here? Now anyway, my life has been changed, so it doesn't matter to talk about it. Those people, they are a bit foolish, but the intention is not bad. They always say that foreigners bully the Chinese people very badly, and the Chinese officials all flatter the foreigners. The common people, if things continue like this, will no longer be able to live. So, they made such a big disaster by burning churches and killing foreigners."</p>

<h3>Gold Futures in Freefall</h3>

<p>Confused Situation Difficult to Break: Yesterday, January 21st, the price of gold futures fell sharply. The market remained chaotic, difficult to control. A frenzied advance and retreat, a madness, totaling 22 taels of difference throughout the day. Dealer sentiment weakened, trading became more complex. Companies like Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Zhen Chang Xiang were largely buying, while Tai Kang Run, Heng Xing, Yu Da, Tai Xing were selling. Both official and unofficial exchange rates rose half a level, likely due to a slight rise in overseas silver markets. As soon as gold prices opened low, falling sharply by 10 taels, buyers who were previously active reversed course, soaring by 10 taels. However, with people feeling uncertain, market prices were volatile, fluctuating by 2-3 taels to 7-8 taels.

Tai Kang Run, Tai Xing Yuan Mao Yong covered their positions. Xin Heng, Yong Heng, Da De Cheng bought. As Indian exchange rates rose and sentiment soured, the price broke through the 700 tael mark.
