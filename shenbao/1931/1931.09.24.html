<p>雄踞東亞虎瞰全球之日本帝國。其爲今日世界上之一等强國。固已爲世界所公認。此次暴力侵犯我東北。兵騰馬嘶。聲勢炫赫。在表面上更足證其國力澎漲。軍國主義之無限發揮。直足以迫害東亞。震揻全球。然而吾人且勿震炫於其表面上之聲勢。試取日本之整個國情而加以檢視。則可知日本本身已百孔千瘡。危機四伏。此次對我東北之暴行。適爲其國内無可彌縫的矛盾之反映。危機之擴大其本身實已步入山窮水盡之末途。危哉日本。自救不暇。反欲害人。斯誠可異。更復可哀。</p>
<p>茲所言日本之危機四伏。實菲由於敵視心理之期望。亦非由於幸災樂禍心理之臆測。蓋都可取事實爲證。</p>
<p>第一處於全世界經濟不景氣之狂潮中。先天不足之日。本自更首當其衝。「經濟國難」之悲嘆聲。普遍日本全國。此種現象之具體說明。即爲工商業凋落。購買力低减。國際貿易入超。工商對凋落之最大原因。固由於世界關税之競爭。國際市塲之萎縮。銀價之低落。而日本因原料貧弱。鐵與煤缺少。不能發展鋼鐵工業。與歐美各國相爭抗。停滯於輕工業階段。亦爲一大因。據統計日本鐵之産額。昭和二年本部爲一五九。（單位千　）朝鮮爲四二三。三年本部爲一五八。朝鮮爲四四三。四年本部爲一五○。朝鮮無統計。其産額逐年鋭减。最爲顯明。煤之産額。亦漸感不足。據矢野恒太編昭和六年國勢圖繪中報告。「······今後我國之鐵與鋼。只圖自給。已需要八九百萬璉之煤矣。因此將來之結局。我國爲煤之入超國。已爲難免之趨勢。······」煤與鐵之漸次缺乏。一方面鋼鐵工業無由發展。一方面輕工業又受産業後進國之競爭。與美國人造絲之排斥。亦一落千丈。即如佔日本輸出總額百分之四十之生絲。去年竟有二十萬梱之存貨。未能銷罄。養蠶業及製絲業。都瀕破産。又如日本對我上海輸出之棉花。一九三○年三月爲一五·九六三梱。四月爲九·七二七梱。一九三一年三月爲一四·○三三梱四月七·三八八梱。即今年較去年減少四月又較三月减少。再就國際貿易觀察。一九三○年對一九二九年之百分比。爲三四·一％。即如對華貿易。據日大藏省發表。自今年正月起至五月秒。入超五百萬元。造成入超之新紀錄。就上列救目字所表示。輕工業之凋落蓋可覘知其大概。不特此也。近世立國基礎。全賴鋼鐵。鋼鐵若徒仰賴輸入。一旦輸入斷絶。國基即根本動摇。故煤鐵之逐年减少。近之爲造成日本經濟不景氣之大因。遠之則更爲日本國運前途心腹痼疾。</p>
<p>工商業凋落。農業亦隨之陷入恐慌狀態之中。不景氣之呼聲響澈全國。影響所及。遂爲（一）税收鋭减。政府歲入不足。地方財政困難。據統計。本年預算當不足八千萬元。超過六千萬元之估計額。不得不緊縮節約。减少俸給。滅俸之國内要電二</p>

<p>主席致開會詞今天大家在此開首都市民大會、因爲東隣的日本無端出兵、佔領我東三省、侵略我國疆土、蹂躪我國主權、横暴默行、良足痛心、大家要曉得、暴日爲什麽要侵略中國、因爲他是一個很小的國家、人口很少、中國是地大物博、人口衆多、所以日本國内貨物均望在中國來消耗、暴日爲他們謀生存、就要侵略中國國土、使中國不能生存、我們要保守祖宗疆土、就是萬衆一心的聨合起來、打倒日本帝國主義、至於日本虎視耽耽、處心積慮的侵略我國的原因、亦就是因爲我國内部的紛擾、未能有團結力量、看着了我們的弱點、所以向我們弱點進攻、中國人民没有一致團結力量是可以證明、　憶往日凡遇一事發生、起初的時候、大家轟轟烈烈、熱血非常的衝動、及至時過境遷、地就冷淡下去、此次東三省的事件非已往的事情可比、我們大家要將敵人是暴日的心理、永久印存在腦海中、大家團結起來、爲中國民族在世界謀生存、打倒日本帝國主義、今日開會的意義即在此、希望大家刻骨銘心、</p>
<p>賴璉演說各位未死的同胞們、平時我們說安南·印度·朝鮮·緬甸是亡國怒、現在我們自己也將是亡國奴了、日本已經打進我們中國的大門了、剛才爲東北死難同胞默念時候、令人痛哭傷心、這乃是我們死的機會到了、我們準備如何去死法呢、惟有在未亡國前、去打倒日本帝國主義、祇要求中央對日本宣戰、南京市全市民衆應該走在前線、殺到日本去、拚一個你死我活、東三省是中國的土地、全國同胞團結着、準備去併命、</p>

<p>具體實施法之建議</p>
<p>胡叔異</p>
<p>日人乘我天災、肆其暴力、分兵略地、惡耗傳來、凡屬血氣之倫、莫不眥裂髮指、自宜各抒所見、各盡厥責、共謀抗日救國辦法、爰就服務敎育界管見所及、草擬本篇、以表救國私衷、尚望全國小學界同志、繼起研究、加以指正是奉、本辦法就國内小學校實際環境設想、不談理論、專在應用上計劃、茲分項述之如下、</p>
<p>（一）敎學方面應從此次日軍出兵侵據藩陽事件作敎學上之出發點、以引起兒童「研究日本」爲敎學中心問題、而極力設法使各科聨絡進行、例如在國語科、選讀或閱覽日軍逞暴情形之記載或報告、在作文方面、可令兒童撰作勸告同胞奮起抗日救國之宣傳文字、在社會科可研究日本之侵略計劃、東省及南满洲鐵路之史地、在算術科可計算東省之面積、日本軍隊之數量、與東省各種損失之統計、在藝術科、可令兒童繪各種日軍逞暴之想象畫、繪各稚抗日宣傳盡、在自然科可研究東省及南满之物産、搶彈火藥之製造等等、在習字方面可練習寫傳單、及標語等等、在體操科可練習各種抗日救國健身操、在唱歌科可歌唱各種從軍或抗日歌詞、務使各科集中一種抗日救國目標、無形間在敎學上獲得抗日救國之訓練、以上不過略舉一例、當然可照樣變化、隨機聨絡進行之、</p>
<p>（二）訓練方面一時想到數種、姑作一例、一·在紀念週報告日軍逞暴情形、及積極救國、辦法、</p>
<p>二·每日舉行晨會、向全體兒童作各種日貨調查之報告、</p>
<p>三·級任敎師、每日定時談話、向兒童宣傳積極救國辦法、</p>
<p>四·編輯兒童壁報、充分利用畫圖以喚起其抗日救國之熱忱、</p>
<p>五·訓練兒童積極備金救國、校中各級設置　金　、用比賽法促成其節省零用、並以養成　蓄習憤、此種備金仍　各個兒童所有、並應存　當地妥實銀行專案保　、備救國急需時雇用之、</p>
<p>六·積極訓練兒童耐苦耐勞習憤、用競賽法、鼓動之、</p>
<p>七·積極提倡兒童健康的運動、用比賽法促成之、</p>
<p>八·規定健身至少限度、非達到相當規定及格標準、不得升級、或畢業、</p>
<p>九·舉行澂文或演說競賽、以抗日救國具體計劃爲中心題目、</p>
<p>（三）敎材方面姑就想到者作一例、詳細當編輯抗日救國具體敎材發行之、</p>
<p>（一）兒歌將日軍在東省逞暴情形、羅列事實、編爲兒歌、</p>
<p>（二）補充敎材將日未侵略满蒙之計劃、與此次日軍暴亂情形、編作補充敎材、以一事爲一題、編成一小册、文字須淺近簡明、俾兒童可自由閱讀、</p>
<p>（三）劇本將此次日兵突佔遼吉事、編成劇本、供小學生表演、</p>
<p>（四）故事在低年級中可可編故事、備敎師參考演講、在高年級即充作課外贖物、</p>
<p>（四）行政方面校長應擬定抗日救國施敎行事歷、按日進行、不至毫無步驟、茲就想到者姑擬一例、</p>
<p>（一）規定每日訓練中心問題通知各敎師執行、</p>
<p>（二）規定敎職員集會日期之順序及討論中心點、</p>
<p>（三）規定客家訪問之步驟及辦法、定期執行之、</p>
<p>（四）規定敎學及訓練之進行步驟分期執行之、</p>
<p>（五）規定兒童集會之次數及其談話要點、</p>
<p>（六）規定檢查兒童健康辦法及其進行步驟、</p>
<p>（七）編製測騐以測騐實施後之結果如何、</p>
<p>（八）定期與各校聨絡進行及其積極的具體辦法、</p>
<p>（九）審查各項抗日救國敎材、</p>
<p>（十）規定其他各種應急步驟而定期預籌、</p>
<p>以上列舉各種辦法、無論眞爲都市與鄉村學校在事實上均不至有所困難、惟如何適合各個學校之實際環境、當然有斟酌變更之必要、作者僅爲提倡一種辦法或藉此而引起各專家之繼起研究多得具體的積極的抗日救國辦法則唯一的希望、</p>

<p>— 潘知本</p>
<p>讀九月二十日自由談所載陳養年君之美國麥種之研究。不禁悚然。今年水稻旣顆粒無收。須恃外糧以爲維持。若災後又種無甚把握之雜糧。則明春仍須乞命於外糧。故今冬所種之雜糧。必須有十分把握。可獲收成者爲貴。不可貿然試種美麥。以民命爲兒戲。是以洛夫博士鄭重宣言曰。誤種美麥。將不堪設想。茲一一述之於左。</p>
<p>（一）美麥乃包括全美國所剩餘之麥。因氣候之不同。士壤之各别。雨量之多寡。而有生長於美之南部者。不適於北部。生長於北部者。或不宜於東部。其在本國尚如此。何况移植於吾國乎。</p>
<p>（二）美麥乃包括多數種類而言。有此種適於吾國某地。而他種不宜於某地者。非俟試種後不易知其適宜與否。陳君於十年來所種之美麥。據云成績甚佳。恐陳君所種者適合鎭江江洲之士壤及氣候耳。惟不知陳君所種之美麥。其學名爲何。能見告否。亦可爲試騐之一助。</p>
<p>（三）余以前亦曾將金陵大學二十六號改良小麥寄至舍下浙江寗海試種。其成績等於零。蓋不合士性或氣候或雨量。致桿矮而不實。按二十六號小麥乃南京附近之固有小麥。非他國貨也。尚不宜於本國。何况美麥乎。</p>

<p>查樓</p>
<p>嘉慶初年日本有唐士名勝圖薈之刻。此書近頗有傳本。全爲當時來游上京者歸國追模之作。其卷帙次第。首大内。次皇城。次内城。次外城。次圍囿郊坰。而終之以直隸各府。其編制先之以總圖而後及乎典章文物風景名勝。系之以說明。而參引名人之題句。其於大内也。則若帝后御冬夏朝服之圖。午門朝參之圖。午門内九重門之圖。太和殿大朝會之圖。除日保和殿宴外藩蒙古之圖。乾清宫千叟宴之圖。重華宫小宴圖。其於皇城也。若天安門頒詔之圖。元夕奉芍藥牡丹之圖。冰嬉之圖。紫光閣試武進士之圖。皇帝躬耕皇后親蠶之圖。皆太平之世聲名文物之盛。即會典諸書所不克備見者也。若東西安門之圖。四牌樓之圖。正陽門正陽橋之圖。則京師城　廛市之蹟。可以自今證古而若合符契者也。至如各衙署寺院壇囿苑禦。或其名厪存。或其地已泯。覽其圖繪。皆宛然如見。數百年來經營締搆之功。猶得長存於吾人之想像。斯誠圖籍之瓌寶。中土所未見。至如人物衣冠之制。多已遠非今狀。尤好古者所不可不一觀。吾以爲古今風俗變遷。最可玩味者。莫如獻樓與妓館。其所載東西青樓之圖。是在今燈市口東邊一帶。妓女皆服長袍盛妝。彈筝琶侑酒。繡簾紅燭。逈非今世所見。正陽門外之查樓。其戲台與今制尚不殊。惟觀客皆露立。婦女始居席棚。民國以前舊式戲院。客坐皆以長凳縱列。側耳聽之。不正對戲台。婦女則居樓上。有主男女合坐。輙大爲時論所詬。警廳從而厲禁之。故知其爲乾嘉遺俗也。今則此種戲院已僅有存者。男女合坐。莫敢不服矣。唐土名勝圖薈繪基狀。至足耐人尋味。牌樓上署廣和查樓四字。查樓者。查姓富商所創。於是凡戲樓皆以查爲名。不知何時誤查爲茶。得此書始克正都人相沿之誤。</p>
<p>照陳君所言。經一人在一地試騐一種作物之成績優良。即以爲可矣。則政府糜巨欵辦農事試騐塲何爲哉。</p>
<p>（五）陳君云。「美麥種植。愈早愈好。」不知早之適足以死之。蓋麥有潛伏期。用以禦寒。俟春暖後開始發蘖而滋生。若發蘖太早。易被凍死。美國農民有在冬季將牛馬放入麥田。或用石滾壓之使不能滋生太盛者。職是故也。</p>

<p>這不能算是辯論呢。也許你家裏的人少，關於家庭裏所發生的麻煩也少，至少要比我操心得好些。姑母那裏，每月要津貼伊二十元，伊没有兒女，眞苦啊。一個老伯母，伊雖住在外甥家裏，但是伊的外甥境况也不好，我又每月津貼伊十元。我妻子年齡比你小，但是我們結婚也早，已生了這一大堆兒女，每年的敎育費，已佔了我收入百分之三十，最小的兩個，我也把他們送到幼兒敎養院去了。我眞有些看不過。這兩個孩子，他們是有母親的，但是寒暖衣食，都没有人留神管理，祗由傭僕們去支配，所以我也不要他們住在家裏，你想我每月的支出，不是很大麽？但是我的妻子還不满足我所供給伊的錢，每天都閙着窮，一會兒没有錢取定製的皮鞋了，一會兒又嚷着没有錢付請客的菜賬了，一會兒又籌劃怎樣付俱樂部的月費了，其他裝飾品的購買，看電影上跳舞塲的消耗，眞使我筋疲力盡，難於供應，所以我覺得夫婦間情感的弛壞，一大半便是金錢作的怪。你說是不是呢？」陳先生一半是發牢騷，一半是想把自已的經濟狀况告訴李夫人，希望伊或者可以指示一些整理財政的方法。</p>
<p>「你家裏的用途，每月是如何支配給你夫人的呢？」李夫人預備貢獻一些意見了。</p>
<p>「假使你能告訴我如何可以節省的方法，那是再好也没有了。我自已知道自己的弊病，便是没有準確的預算，所以拉了一大筆虧空：但是天理良心，我自已用的錢，眞很少。」</p>
<p>「你該規定一個數目，把家用多少，供給你夫人的多少，每月準確的交給你夫人，並且和伊約定，不許溢出，或者可以使你的經濟，可以减少一些。」</p>
<p>「唉！假使我是這樣辦了，伊一定會把家用都移作别用，整個兒的化在伊的身上了：結果家用没有，還得我設法第二次照付。」</p>
<p>「那麽以後家用，都由你自己管，你祇給伊一筆個人的月費，不要多給伊，　　不是也可以有了標準？」</p>
<p>「我白天在外面做事，精神上已忙不過來，還要管家，何必要妻子呢？」</p>

<p>Yoshizawa Prevaricates, Claiming He Has Not Received Detailed Reports</p>
<p>Vigorously Obstructs League of Nations Intervention</p>
<p>Envoy Shi Exposes the Truth</p>
<p>British Representative Speaks Righteously</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to news received late tonight, the League of Nations Council, based on its resolution this afternoon, has already telegraphed the governments of China and Japan to halt the expansion of military action in Manchuria. The chief representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries in the League of Nations Council held a secret meeting tonight and carefully studied maps of the Far East at the meeting. After the chief representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy met with Japanese chief representative Yoshizawa, the impression gained by the representatives of various countries was that the actions of the Japanese military in Manchuria were more excessive than the Japanese government was willing to admit.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met today to discuss the Manchurian incident. The debate was intense, and adjournments were repeatedly announced to allow the representatives to calm down and talk privately to seek a way to reconcile. However, Japanese representative Yoshizawa vigorously opposed direct intervention by the League of Nations, insisting that instructions from Tokyo had not yet arrived. Therefore, Council President Le Loux announced an adjournment until tomorrow's meeting. No concrete results were obtained today, but slight progress has been made, as Le Loux was commissioned to draft an application to China and Japan, asking them to abide by the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. This proposal was put forward by British representative Cecil, as detailed information on the dispute has not yet been received, and this is all that the League of Nations can do. Cecil also advocated notifying the United States of all actions of the League of Nations, which was unanimously approved. Le Loux also asked Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji and Japanese representative Yoshizawa to have private talks. Shi agreed, but stated that Japanese troops had invaded and occupied Tongliao County. ⊙Foreign Ministry Lodges Third Emergency Protest with Japan⊙Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Chen Mingshu, and others went to Guangdong to discuss the unity of Beijing and Guangdong⊙(See Domestic Important Telegrams)Denmark Bans Cash Exports⊙(See Foreign Important Telegrams)Zhang Jia'ao and others telegraphed the United States, asking them to uphold justice in the case of the invasion of the eastern provinces⊙(See Local News)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>This should not be regarded as direct negotiations between China and Japan, and the Council must continue to discuss the case tomorrow. As the debate proceeded, Yoshizawa vigorously opposed the suggestion that military attachés from the embassies in Beiping and Tokyo go to Manchuria to investigate the origins of the case, saying that the Tokyo government would never agree to this. This case is a matter between China and Japan, and if other countries intervene, it will only aggravate the situation. However, Yoshizawa has temporarily approved the proposal to apply to both governments to stop military action and withdraw troops to their original defenses, but if there are instructions from Tokyo to the contrary, it will still have to be cancelled.</p>
<p>Today, Cecil's proposal was seconded by German representative and Foreign Minister Curtius. Curtius said that applying to China and Japan to stop the escalation of the situation is only a temporary measure, and there should be continued action afterwards. Curtius also said that the League of Nations cannot be afraid to move forward because this issue is thorny. If so, not only will the League of Nations' credibility be swept away, but it will not be able to survive. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese army's occupation of South Manchuria is a very serious matter. If it continues to develop, there will be more and more disputes, which will inevitably affect policies outside Manchuria. The League of Nations is now gradually understanding this. Tonight, the League of Nations expressed surprise at the Japanese government's delay in providing detailed reports on the Manchurian incident, as it is known that all transportation in Manchuria is now under the control of the Japanese military authorities. At today's meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council, British representative Cecil strongly urged the Chinese and Japanese troops to immediately retreat to their original locations while the League of Nations studies the case, and said that all countries must avoid incidents like those that occurred in Manchuria. He asked the governments of China and Japan to support the League of Nations' view of aggressive behavior and not to take any further actions that would exacerbate the Manchurian situation. Japanese chief representative Yoshizawa arose and said that he greatly agreed with the noble views expressed by Lord Cecil, and that the Japanese government very much wanted to respect the Briand-Kellogg Pact. Yoshizawa went on to describe Japan's overpopulation and the huge interests that Japan has in Manchuria, and finally said that the Japanese government is very willing to resolve more than 100 county cases that could disturb the friendly relations between China and Japan. Chinese chief representative Shi Zhaoji then arose and reported to the Executive Council the latest news he had received from the Chinese government, and declared that the Chinese military and civilians in Manchuria were abiding by the government's instructions and were being very cautious, not taking actions that could make the situation worse, but the situation in Manchuria is now deteriorating, and he asked the League of Nations Executive Council to order Japan to withdraw its troops in Manchuria to their original locations. What is now before the Executive Council is the issue of the invasion of Chinese territory, which is extremely important and should immediately appoint a commission of inquiry. In short, the Japanese army is still occupying Manchuria, so please order the Japanese army to withdraw immediately. At this point, Le Loux, the Spanish representative and chairman of the Executive Council, moved that the League of Nations issue an urgent telegram to the Chinese and Japanese governments, asking them not to take any actions that could increase the situation in Manchuria or impede the peaceful resolution of this issue. The chairman also proposed a motion stating that the Chinese and Japanese representatives should be consulted to find sufficient methods to enable China and Japan to immediately withdraw their troops without endangering the safety of their nationals or the protection of their industries. The chairman also asked the Executive Council to approve the sending of the minutes of today's meeting and the documents on Manchurian matters to the US government. The Executive Council unanimously expressed its agreement with the above proposals. The Chinese representative said that time is of the essence in resolving the difficulties. The resolution that has just been passed is the first step in the plan that should be adopted. Please conduct an impartial investigation by the League of Nations into the beginning and end of this case. The way to investigate the entire case and establish the compensation that should be given has not yet been blocked, and please reconvene the Executive Council tomorrow. Japanese representative Yoshizawa agreed with the peaceful views expressed by Chinese representative Shi and then said that he would like to notify the Executive Council of all the detailed news about the Manchurian incident, but he could not say for sure that he would receive this news tomorrow. He is now awaiting instructions from the Japanese government regarding its views on this matter. Cecil asked the Japanese representative to promptly urge his government to issue instructions, and said that if the allegation made by Representative Shi that hundreds of men, women and children had been killed in Manchuria was true, then the occurrence of a major incident in Manchuria could be generally seen, so this matter was very important, and the instructions of the Japanese government to its representative in Geneva should be issued promptly. At this point, the discussion ended, and the Chairman of the Executive Council announced that the next meeting to handle this matter would be held at the earliest possible time. The four chief representatives attending the League of Nations this evening, together with the Chinese and Japanese chief representatives, held a closed-door meeting to formulate a text, which was sent to the Chinese and Japanese governments, asking both sides to restrain all actions that could exacerbate the situation. The participants in this meeting were Spanish Chief Representative Le Loux (Spanish Foreign Minister), British Chief Representative Viscount Cecil, German Chief Representative Curtius (German Foreign Minister), Italian Chief Representative Grandi (Italian Foreign Minister), Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji (Envoy to the United Kingdom), and Japanese Chief Representative Yoshizawa (Japanese Ambassador to France). The results of the discussion have not yet been made public. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council convened a second emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss China's application for intervention in the Manchurian issue and formally resolved to authorize Council President Le Loux to notify China and Japan to prevent the escalation of the situation and order the troops to return to their original defenses. The resolution passed by the entire Council is as follows: (1) Urgently request China and Japan to prevent all actions in Manchuria that could escalate the situation and hinder a peaceful solution; (2) Study with the representatives of China and Japan ways to enable the troops of both countries to withdraw immediately without endangering the lives and property of the people of both countries. The Council also resolved to send all the meeting minutes and all the official documents concerning the Sino-Japanese Manchurian incident to the United States for the reference of the Washington government. Although Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji requested that the meeting be held again on Wednesday, the Council decided to adjourn and wait for President Le Loux to convene it again. President Le Loux, German representative Curtius, French representative Briand, Italian representative Grandi, and representatives of several other countries unanimously maintained that the League of Nations' resolution today was only its first part, and that further actions would be taken until the case was completely resolved. All the representatives on the Council were fearful that the Manchurian issue had reached a critical juncture and that a solution was urgently needed. After the resolution was passed, Envoy Shi expressed his acceptance, but with one understanding, that is, it was recognized that this was only the first step and that more active progress would be made in the future. The various discussions in the future can only be regarded as discussions within the Council and cannot be regarded as direct negotiations between China and Japan. Yoshizawa said that before receiving instructions from Tokyo, he could not provide more information. At this afternoon's meeting, Yoshizawa was nearly persuaded to comply with the Council's meeting procedures, and it took several persuasions before he complied, causing the meeting to be delayed by seventy minutes. The Council heard Yoshizawa's speech in silence and tension this morning. Yoshizawa recounted how Japan respects international treaties, how much Japan has invested in Manchuria, and how Japan is now willing to make every effort to peacefully resolve the Manchurian issue, etc. After Yoshizawa finished speaking, Envoy Shi stood up vigorously and raised a bundle of telegrams, saying, "These are the telegrams I have received since this morning. If you read them, you will know that the situation in Manchuria is deteriorating at any time and that the situation is so urgent that it cannot be delayed any longer. Many good Chinese people have been massacred, and even women and children have not been spared. The issue today is the issue of aggression against China. Our discussion should recognize this statement. The issue is extremely urgent and cannot be delayed. The Chinese people are now shouting themselves hoarse in seeking a peaceful solution." Envoy Shi also said that according to the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, the Council has an unshirkable duty to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. The League of Nations should now send a delegation to Manchuria as soon as possible to investigate the truth. The Japanese troops are occupying more and more Manchurian territory, and the Japanese troops must withdraw from Chinese territory immediately, etc. (22nd National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat announced today that the Council will convene another special meeting to discuss the Manchurian incident and confirmed that League of Nations President Le Loux sent an urgent telegram to the governments of China and Japan last night, strongly urging both sides to avoid all actions that could escalate the situation and expressing the League of Nations' deep confidence that both sides could withdraw troops invading each other's territory to their original defenses. President Le Loux also formally notified Nanjing and Tokyo that he had begun discussions with the representatives of China and Japan, and that representatives of European powers had also been invited to participate in the discussions. More detailed reports on this incident are now awaited from both sides. (23rd National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the incident in the eastern provinces, the Foreign Ministry has lodged two emergency protests. Now, Japanese troops continue to invade and occupy territories. Changchun, Yingkou, Kuanchengzi, Jilin, and the Jichang Railway, as well as other places, have been successively captured, and they have also arbitrarily burned and destroyed properties, and many people have been killed. The Foreign Ministry has now lodged a third serious protest, believing that the Japanese side is deliberately escalating the incident. Their responsibility for disregarding international law, international treaties, and destroying peace in East Asia should be further increased. We still demand the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops and the complete return of occupied territories. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

This case should be referred to international negotiations in the capital to have a position, as this is the only way to gain the sympathy of the world.

<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang in Beiping stating that according to a telegram from Zhong Yu, the Special Diplomatic Commissioner in Harbin, on the 21st, the Acting Soviet Russian Consul in Harbin, Erlov, stated that the Japanese military riot this time had hindered the operation of the Eastern Railway. The Chinese side of the Railway Bureau or the negotiating agency should jointly make a statement to the Japanese side to stop it. The consul protested to the Japanese consul yesterday, and the Japanese consul promised to forward it to the government, but has not yet received a reply. There are rumors outside that Trustee Ku had contacted the Japanese side. The consul can definitely declare that this is not the case. The claim that the Soviet Union sent troops to the border to occupy Manchurian stations is even more unfounded. Please do not believe it. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agency received a telegram from Moscow on the 23rd stating that a Soviet Union government organ newspaper commented that the steps taken by the great powers in response to Japan's current aggression are not yet clear. It is also unknown whether Japan consulted with the United Kingdom beforehand. The US Foreign Ministry's statement is also not entirely clear. Japan's seemingly unconventional actions are probably something the great powers did not expect. Various countries are preparing appropriate plans to seek their own interests, etc. It can also be seen from the Soviet Union newspapers' criticism of Japan in recent days.

<p>The Japanese Empire, powerfully situated in East Asia, with a global outlook. Its status as a first-class power in the world today is already recognized by the world. This time, it violently invaded our Northeast, with the sounds of troops and horses, displaying a dazzling momentum. Superficially, it further proves the swelling of its national power and the unlimited development of militarism, which is enough to persecute East Asia and shake the world. However, we should not be dazzled by its superficial momentum. If we examine Japan's overall national situation, we can see that Japan itself is full of holes and riddled with crises. This violent act against our Northeast is a reflection of the irreconcilable contradictions within its country. The expansion of the crisis is actually leading it to the end of its road. Alas, Japan! It is too late to save itself, yet it wants to harm others. This is truly strange, and even more pitiful.</p>
<p>What is said here about Japan being surrounded by crises is certainly not due to hostile expectations, nor is it due to speculations based on schadenfreude. It can all be verified by facts.</p>
<p>First, in the midst of the global economic recession, Japan, with its inherent deficiencies, is the first to bear the brunt. The lament of "economic national crisis" is widespread throughout Japan. The concrete manifestation of this phenomenon is the decline of industry and commerce, the reduction of purchasing power, and the excess of imports over exports in international trade. The biggest reason for the decline of industry and commerce is undoubtedly the competition of world tariffs, the shrinkage of the international market, and the fall in the price of silver. However, Japan's weakness in raw materials, the lack of iron and coal, its inability to develop the steel industry, and its competition with European and American countries, stagnating at the stage of light industry, is also a major reason. According to statistics, Japan's iron production in 1927 was 159 in the mainland (unit: thousand), and 423 in Korea. In 1928, it was 158 in the mainland and 443 in Korea. In 1929, it was 150 in the mainland, and there were no statistics for Korea. Its production has been sharply decreasing year by year, which is most obvious. Coal production is also gradually feeling insufficient. According to the report in the "National Situation Illustrated" compiled by Yano Tsuneta in 1931, "......In the future, if our country's iron and steel only aim to be self-sufficient, it will need 8 to 9 million tons of coal. Therefore, in the future, our country will inevitably become a coal-importing country...". The gradual lack of coal and iron means that, on the one hand, the steel industry cannot develop, and on the other hand, the light industry is subject to competition from industrially backward countries and the exclusion of American rayon, which has also plummeted. For example, raw silk, which accounts for 40% of Japan's total exports, had 200,000 bales of inventory last year that could not be sold. The sericulture and silk reeling industries are on the verge of bankruptcy. For example, Japan's cotton exports to Shanghai in March 1930 were 15,963 bales, in April they were 9,727 bales, in March 1931 they were 14,033 bales, and in April they were 7,388 bales. That is, this year's April decreased compared to last year, and April also decreased compared to March. Looking at international trade, the percentage of 1930 compared to 1929 was 34.1%. For example, according to the Japanese Ministry of Finance, since January of this year, the import surplus was 5 million yuan in May, creating a new record of import surplus. From the above-mentioned figures, the decline of light industry can be roughly seen. Not only that, the foundation of modern nation-building depends entirely on steel. If steel relies solely on imports, once imports are cut off, the national foundation will be fundamentally shaken. Therefore, the year-by-year reduction of coal and iron is a major cause of Japan's economic recession in the near term, and a chronic disease of Japan's national destiny in the long term.</p>
<p>The decline of industry and commerce has led to agriculture also falling into a state of panic. The cry of recession resounds throughout the country. The impact has resulted in (1) a sharp decrease in tax revenue, insufficient government revenue, and difficult local finances. According to statistics, this year's budget will be short of 80 million yuan, exceeding the estimated amount of 60 million yuan. It is necessary to tighten austerity measures and reduce salaries.

<p>Japan's Attitude</p>
<p>Insisting on Sino-Japanese Solution Alone</p>
<p>Comments from the London Chronicle</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is learned from important sources that the Japanese government's declaration on its attitude towards Manchuria has been drafted and is currently under consideration by Foreign Minister Shidehara. It is expected to be released within one or two days. At that time, a copy will be sent to Geneva. The government is now considering the League of Nations' document and expects to respond soon, stating that Japan is willing to withdraw its troops to the railway zone, but first it must negotiate with China (without interference from third parties) regarding guarantees of security and the safety of Japanese lives and property. Japanese newspapers and the public seem to agree with Foreign Minister Shidehara and are willing to reduce the scope of the incident and resolve it as soon as possible. There is absolutely no intention of permanently occupying the currently occupied areas. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The attitude Japan will take towards the League of Nations' request for it to withdraw its troops from Chinese territory in Manchuria is attracting worldwide attention. It is learned that the Japanese government will issue a formal declaration tomorrow, explaining the Tokyo government's position on the Sino-Japanese incident. The declaration has been discussed once by cabinet members. Foreign Minister Shidehara visited Prime Minister Wakatsuki today to discuss the League of Nations' actions. The Foreign Minister told the Prime Minister that it was necessary to issue a statement clarifying Japan's policy, and that it was necessary for Japan to maintain its reputation for fulfilling international obligations and adhering to international faith. Land Minister Minami, Chief of Staff Kanaya, and other military authorities also convened an emergency meeting at the same time. After the meeting, Land Minister Minami told reporters that Japan did not hesitate to withdraw its troops from Manchuria, but hoped that the major powers would understand the Japanese military's actions on Saturday. Land Minister Minami also stated that the Japanese military's actions in Manchuria had not violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. During the meeting, Japan had not yet received an official telegram from Geneva reporting the League of Nations' actions. According to news telegrams from Geneva, the League of Nations did not understand Japan's attitude of protecting its vested rights in Manchuria. The declaration tomorrow will probably reiterate that the Japanese military's actions in Manchuria since Saturday were in self-defense and that Japan had not provoked a state of war or violated international law. (Kokumin, 23rd)</p>
<p>The London Chronicle published an editorial this morning, giving the motion put forward by the Japanese representative in Geneva that the Sino-Japanese dispute should be resolved by China and Japan themselves a "cold" reception. The newspaper emphasized that the United States and the League of Nations are now closely watching the movement of Japanese troops in the vast land of Manchuria, and other people are also very concerned. For example, Russia is also... The newspaper also said that there is evidence showing that the Japanese commanders have greatly exceeded the limits allowed by the Tokyo government. It is heard that there are very serious differences of opinion in the Tokyo government on this matter. If so, finding a solution may be slightly easier than initially expected. But in any case, the Japanese government must recognize that the path currently being taken is extremely dangerous. Japanese diplomacy has repeatedly demonstrated in a dramatic way its deep understanding of the foolishness of attempting to offend world public opinion. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Result of Dispute Between Japanese Foreign and Land Ministers</p>
<p>Decided on this Novel and Peculiar Term</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic community received a telegram from Tokyo stating that the Japanese cabinet held another meeting, during which there was quite a dispute between the Foreign and Land Ministers. The Foreign Minister said that if the army wanted to annex the three northeastern provinces, it would be like swallowing a bomb, which would probably cause international accusations and lead to the same fate as Germany. Therefore, it was decided to have a "diplomatic guarantee of occupation." It was also heard that Land Minister Minami had telegraphed to cancel Doihara's appointment as mayor of Shenyang. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the post-incident measures of the Manchurian Incident, it was initially considered a local issue and it was decided to negotiate with the Northeast authorities. As a result of yesterday's cabinet meeting, it was decided to change the pre-determined policy and negotiate with the Nanjing Central Government. However, Land Minister Minami strongly opposed it at the cabinet meeting, and then decided to obey the government's policy. (Dentsu telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Prime Minister Wakatsuki invited Land Minister Minami to his official residence last night to solicit the Land Minister's opinion on the post-incident measures of the Manchurian Incident. The Land Minister said that according to the current situation, it should not be further expanded, but the people's sentiment on the Chinese side is激越, and there may be some conflicts. The army intends to continue to guarantee the occupation and conduct diplomatic negotiations to resolve the pending issues in Manchuria and Mongolia. Prime Minister Wakatsuki replied that he understood the Land Minister's intentions, but if the propaganda of the military department is too激烈, it may hinder Sino-Japanese negotiations, and hoped that a慎重 attitude would be adopted at this time. Then, they discussed the period of stationing troops and Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations for a long time and reached a consensus. The Prime Minister immediately ordered Secretary-General Kawasaki to visit Foreign Minister Shidehara to report the results of the meeting with the Land Minister. (Dentsu telegram, 23rd)</p>

After investigation, these are completely inaccurate. The Chinese government has never made such a proposal.

<p>Contents of Statement by Our Delegation to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The general idea of the written statement submitted by the Chinese delegation to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations is as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with the order of the government of this country, please pay attention to the following events, and please convene the Council of the League of Nations immediately in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant, so as to take the most effective method to ensure international peace. The Chinese delegation notified the Council on the 19th of this month of this serious situation and the fact that China is not responsible for any fault. Since then, it has repeatedly received telegrams from the government of this country, learning that the situation has become more and more serious. The formal troops of Japan have, without cause, begun bombing Chinese troops and Shenyang, while destroying arsenals, barracks, and burning gunpowder depots, and disarming Chinese troops in the Changchun Kuanchengtzu area. Afterwards, they estimated and occupied many important cities in Shenyang and Andong, and public institutions in various places were forcibly occupied, and all transportation institutions were also occupied. In response to this violent behavior, the Chinese army and people, in compliance with the orders of the Chinese government, did not engage in any resistance or other behaviors that could worsen the situation. China, as a member of the League of Nations, believes that the League of Nations should take effective actions in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Covenant with regard to this situation. Therefore, this delegation, in accordance with the order of the Chinese government, requests the Council to take the most effective measures in accordance with the powers granted by Article 11 of the Covenant to prevent the expansion of this situation, so as not to endanger international peace, and to restore the original situation, and to determine the nature and amount of compensation that China should receive for the losses caused by this incident. The Chinese government has decided to abide by the recommendations of the Council and the resolutions of the General Assembly without dissent. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>National Government</p>
<h3 id="e32">Publishes Proclamation to the People <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Government Has Made Its Final Determination</p>
<p>The Whole Country Should Seek Consistent Unity</p>
<p>Organize Your Steps to Listen to the Guidance of the Central Government</p>
<p>Vow to Save the Country and Promote the Spirit of the Nation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued a proclamation to the people on the 23rd. Regarding the attitude that the people of the whole country should take after the atrocities of the Japanese army occurred in the three northeastern provinces, the Central Government has already given detailed instructions. The National Government now summarizes the government's current handling of this incident and the government's hopes for the people, and presents them to the people of the whole country. The seriousness of the nature of the Japanese military's atrocities in the East Province this time is unprecedented. This笙 incident has a great relationship with the survival of our country. When the military atrocities began on the 18th of this month, there was no incident of肇釁 beforehand, and its actions conflicted with international practice and any treaty. It openly invaded our territory, killed our people, and humiliated our military and government officials, and continued the atrocities without end. The humiliation that the Japanese have inflicted on our country is a threat to all civilized countries in the world. The establishment of the League of Nations was originally to prevent war and to seek the collective strength of all countries to prevent aggression. After this incident occurred, the government immediately reported the Japanese atrocities to the League of Nations and requested that the first step be to make the Japanese army withdraw immediately. The禡 League of Nations Administrative Committee has held a meeting and has already made a resolution on withdrawing troops after stopping military action. The government has also telegraphed to the League of Nations Administrative Committee that once the withdrawal is complete, it should immediately find a fair solution to this barbaric incident. It is deeply believed that if this incident is fairly investigated, the League of Nations will be able to give us full justice and reasonable remedy in accordance with its responsibilities. The government has now appealed this case to the Administrative Committee of the League of Nations to await the solution of public reason, so it has strictly ordered the national army to avoid conflict with the Japanese army, and has also uniformly admonished the people to maintain a serious and镇静 attitude. As for the Japanese residents in China, the government has also strictly ordered local officials to protect them carefully. This is the responsibility of a civilized country. We should respond to barbarism with civilization and reveal the crimes of unreasonable atrocities with a reasonable attitude, in order to ensure that justice will prevail. However, in order to maintain the independence of our country, the government has made its final determination and is prepared for self-defense, and will not fail the expectations of the people. At this moment, all domestic disputes should be冰释 immediately. Compatriots across the country should abandon their private opinions, unite together, gather under the National Government, seek security for the country, and seek independence for the nation. Compatriots across the country should especially recognize that there is no way to deal with foreign countries without upholding national unity, and should never allow any意气 or emotion to摇动 the policies and steps determined by the Central Government, so as to affect the determination to save the country consistently. The government is shouldering this difficult task,承危, and is at the critical juncture of存亡绝续. It should only adhere to the Central Government's strategy, pay attention at all times, and make it public to the people of the country at any time. All my compatriots, trust the government, organize your steps, listen to the guidance of the Central Government consistently, vow to save the country, to promote the spirit of our nation, and to redeem our current shame. This is especially what I would like to share with my compatriots across the country. (West telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Urgent to Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Tang Shaocuan, Mr. Deng Zeru, Mr. Xiao Focheng, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Gu Xiangqin, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Bai Jiansheng, and Mr. Tang Mengxiao in Guangzhou: Greetings. The country is unfortunate, natural and man-made disasters have arisen one after another, this is truly an autumn of crisis and survival, a moment of hairbreadth. I believe that in today's situation, without seeking peace, it is impossible to save the country, and without ending disputes, it is impossible to resist foreign aggression. After years of war in our country, the plight of the people has become unbearable to look back upon, in addition, bandits are everywhere, making it difficult to suppress them, and heaven has sent great disasters, rivers are overflowing, and the lives and property of the people are drifting away with the floods, which cannot be counted. Even if the borders are peaceful and there are no internal wars, and we work together to seek relief, the people's lives and the country's pulse, which are barely surviving, may not easily restore their vitality. Moreover, strong neighbors are pressing on, foreign troubles are already deep, and the loss of China is imminent. In times of crisis and shock, we should unite our efforts, catch up quickly, and save ourselves from danger. The only way to do this is through peace and unification. Gentlemen, you are revolutionary leaders, advanced members of the party and the country, with far-sighted plans and deep considerations, which are admired by the whole country. You have long been familiar with the interests of the country and the nation, and you all adhere to the Prime Minister's doctrine of saving the country and the people. Sharing weal and woe, what hatred and resentment cannot be explained? You will certainly not hold each other down due to differences in political views, causing the great territory of China to be lost. Yesterday, I heard that you gentlemen replied to the three gentlemen Zhang Puquan, et al., that the armies of Guangdong and Guangxi are stationed on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi, and will not lightly start a war. I admire your love of peace, and swords and spears will soon turn into jade and silk. Not only will the displaced compatriots be able to celebrate their recovery, but also the party and the country, which have been painstakingly created, will have a chance of revitalization. However, Fuju cannot stop himself from speaking, because every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. When the country is in deep trouble and the people are suffering to the extreme, I cannot remain silent. I dare to sincerely appeal to you gentlemen to immediately cancel the hostile situation and jointly seek survival. One day, the beautiful rivers and mountains will be consolidated, and the descendants of the gods will live forever. When drinking water, remember the source, all thanks to the gifts of you gentlemen. The question of safety, danger, survival, and death depends on this one move. I earnestly express my words, please consider them carefully. Han Fuju kowtows and respectfully submits. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At 5:00 PM on the 23rd, the presidium of the Citizens' Assembly went to Hu's residence to request an audience on behalf of the citizens. Hu personally came out to meet with them. The representatives first extended their condolences for Hu's health and then stated their purpose, hoping that Hu would cancel his leave and take office immediately to share the difficult task. Hu replied that his blood pressure was still above 170, and it was difficult for him to fall asleep at night, so he could not take on heavy duties. He said that the Japanese atrocities were a great disaster for the country, and as a member of the Central Committee, he would contribute whatever strength he had to the country, and he would never shirk his responsibility. He said that he had been meeting with Wu, Dai, and other committee members to discuss countermeasures. However, since his health has not recovered, he cannot sit for long periods of time, so it is difficult for him to attend various meetings. Fortunately, he can contribute his opinions to the central government at any time, so attending or not attending is not very important. Hu's face still looked sick, and his hands were often cold. He spoke with the representatives for about an hour and finally stated that if his health permitted, he would not give up his responsibility. The representatives then took their leave.

<p>Telegram from the Philippines reporting to the National Government and all compatriots: Our country is unfortunate, disasters follow one another. The Japanese pirates take the opportunity to forcibly occupy our Eastern Provinces, slaughtering our soldiers and civilians, burning, destroying, and looting, which is extremely barbaric and intolerable. Please quickly stop internal strife and declare war on Japan. The overseas Chinese in this province vow to be in the vanguard. Sent by the Overseas Chinese United Association in Mentong, Philippines.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Chahar Provincial Government to all newspapers for your information: The national destiny is not to be abandoned, disasters frequently occur. As neighboring states, we should express sincerity in providing relief. However, imperialist Japan, without cause, attacked our key locations such as Shenyang, Andong, Yingkou, and Changchun. Our troops adhered to the non-war treaty and offered no resistance. The enemy then arbitrarily burned and massacred extensively. When the shocking news arrived, over 20,000 of our two million compatriots in Chahar Province gathered spontaneously at the provincial government on the 21st of this month, weeping bitterly and petitioning. They all stated that the nation would soon be lost and that they would rather die as ghosts serving the country than live as slaves of a subjugated nation. They pleaded for the central government to devise countermeasures. Their weeping and sobs, their fervor, were extraordinary. At that time, their shared hatred of the enemy could easily have caused trouble with foreigners, so we dissuaded them with tears and righteousness for three long hours before they dispersed, each with tears in their eyes. We respectfully report the situation of the public petition and humbly ask for your consideration.

Japanese soldiers suddenly attacked Liaoshen, expelled officials, and carried out an invasion of our Manchuria and Mongolia, which is now plainly revealed. Upon hearing the news, our troops wept inconsolably. Adding to the red scourge in Jiangxi Province and the Yangtze River floods, internal and external troubles are like a pile of eggs. As people of the nation, how can we continue to harbor prejudices and await destruction? We must quickly cease internal conflicts, rouse a shared sense of hatred, and C. et al., being soldiers, have a responsibility to defend the nation. We are willing to lead our troops to be the backing for diplomacy. Our sincere intentions, we hope, will be considered.

<p>Telegram from Hangzhou to the Shenbao Newspaper for your information: The violent Japanese have started an unprovoked incident, invading and occupying Liaoji, and looking to enter Guan Nei to realize their dream of a continental policy. The situation is extremely serious, unprecedented. With frequent reports of dire news, our hearts ache. With the nation in such peril, we cannot resist aggression without the entire nation, from top to bottom, uniting with utmost sincerity and determination under unified governance. For several years, Commander-in-Chief Chiang has led the party army, completed unification, eliminated rebels, and eradicated bandits, making rare and remarkable achievements and becoming the cornerstone of the party and the nation. His loyalty, courage, and decisiveness are admired by all. At this time of crisis, military affairs require competent leadership, and unification depends on national trust. It is hoped that the entire nation will understand the difficulty of the national situation, recognize the extreme danger of division, and unanimously support Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Under unified command, we must fight the Japanese bandits and recover our territory with the blood of 400 million people. This urgent telegram cannot express the urgency of the situation. Respectfully from the Hangzhou City Anti-Japanese National Salvation Citizens' Assembly.</p>
<p>Telegram from Suzhou to the Shenbao Newspaper and forwarded to all newspapers for your information: The violent and barbaric Japanese, taking advantage of our disasters, calamities, and banditry, suddenly sent troops to attack and occupy the Liaoning and Jilin areas, killing our soldiers and civilians and destroying international peace. Never has there been such a great shame and humiliation. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot but feel pain. We wish that all our compatriots throughout the country would unite and do their utmost to save the nation. The survival of the nation and the race depends on this one move.

<p>Telegram from Lanzhou to all newspapers for your information: Since the Wanxian Massacre occurred, the entire nation has been filled with anger. Our government has reasoned and strived for a resolution. Unexpectedly, the Japanese imperialists have harbored malicious intentions. Not only have they disregarded diplomatic relations, but they have also intensified their actions, destroying international law and carrying out large-scale aggression, to the extent that they sent troops to attack and occupy Shenyang and Changchun on the bright day of this month, attacking Yingkou, and even threatening to take Beiping directly. Such behavior indicates that they intend to annex our Guandong, swallow our North China, occupy all our national territory, and destroy our Chinese nation. The alarming news has been received with extreme grief and indignation. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? If we retreat further, the nation will no longer be a nation. At this critical moment of survival, we should unite in shared hatred of the enemy and rise up together to resist aggression. With unity from top to bottom, we should prepare to declare war and fight those short bandits back to back to protect our sovereignty and save our nation from peril. This committee is willing to lead all the people of Gansu to serve as a rear guard until death. This telegram is filled with anger, and we hope you will consider it.

<p>Telegram from Anqing to all newspapers for your information: Having just read the telegram from the Central Executive Committee and Vice Commander Zhang, we were shocked to learn that Japanese troops, starting on the 18th, have occupied Shenyang, Changchun, Fushun, Jinzhou, Xinmin, Yingkou, and other places without cause, burning institutions, destroying railways, shooting people, looting shops, detaining military and government officials, and confiscating military and police firearms, committing atrocities unprecedented in human history and setting a terrible example unmatched in the international community. Upon receiving the alarming news, we were both shocked and grieved. It is clear that Japan has been coveting Manchuria and Mongolia for some time, but because our country has been plagued by internal strife for years and lacks the strength to deal with foreign aggression, coupled with the selfishness and collusion of traitors, it has led to a sudden outbreak and the occurrence of this tragedy. If the people of our country do not unite at this time, eliminate internal disputes, and jointly devise strategies to resist aggression, the nation will inevitably fall into a state of irreparable destruction. If we allow this to happen, causing our five-thousand-year-old civilized country to perish in our generation, how can we face our ancestors who worked so hard to build it, and how can we face our descendants who will be forever enslaved? Thinking of this, we cannot help but shudder. We earnestly hope that the leaders of the party and the nation, and wise men from all sides, will work together to save the situation. This urgent appeal is submitted for your consideration. Respectfully from Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, and all committee members.</p>

At this critical moment, you gentlemen hold military power and lead the armed forces of the people.

Do not engage in internal conflicts again, which will only hasten our destruction. Otherwise, you will not only be public enemies of the nation but also criminals of the race. This is a heartfelt appeal, and we hope you will consider it. Respectfully from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Chinese University of Beiping.</p>

Regarding Japan's actions, we feel that if the short bandits are not destroyed, where will we belong? We specifically call for unity in the country and joint resistance against foreign aggression. National mobilization and declaration of war on Japan will be glorious even in defeat. Our company, located overseas, will fulfill our national duty by uniting the overseas Chinese and vowing to sacrifice everything to serve the nation and be the backing for the government.

<p>Telegram from Tianjin to all newspapers for your information: The floods in the Jianghuai River basin have caused disaster, submerging half of China and displacing millions of people. This extraordinary calamity and catastrophe is unprecedented in history. All of us who are of the same blood and race deeply feel the pain of hunger and drowning and are jointly planning relief efforts to help them find shelter. Therefore, on August 27, the Tianjin City Flood Relief Committee was established, with its office located in the Tianjin Municipal Government. Seventeen articles of organizational regulations were passed, and Zhang Xueming was elected as the chairman, Yan Junren and Zhang Pintai as the vice-chairmen, Quan Shaoqing as the director of general affairs, and Ji Hua, among others, as the director of relief affairs. They immediately began their work in separate departments and decided to initially raise 60,000 yuan to be remitted to the National Government Relief Commission for emergency relief. Subsequently, they will separately solicit donations, as much as possible. They also request that people from all walks of life in Tianjin initiate branches and designate various banks in the Tianjin Banking Association as deposit institutions to report and distribute funds to the disaster areas at any time. Alas, even a single drop helps an ocean; in the same boat, we must rely on mutual assistance. In this deep water and fire, the telegram is filled with sorrow. We respectfully submit the entire matter and humbly request your understanding. Respectfully from the Tianjin City Flood Relief Committee.</p>

<p>Wan Fulin, Bao Wen-yue, Li Shizeng, and Zhang Ji arrived in Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, traveling by Ford airplane from Ping. They stopped in Xuzhou to refuel and then flew to Beijing, landing at Ming Palace Airport at 2:30 PM. Those who came to welcome them included Shao Lizi and others. They had lunch at the Lizi Society. Reporters wanted to interview Wan, but he declined due to the fatigue of the journey. Bao Wen-yue then received them, showing them the detailed account of Rong Zhen's escape and adding that how to respond to future Japanese atrocities could only be decided after meeting with Chairman Chiang. However, the military and government authorities of the Northeast deeply felt that in the face of foreign aggression, they should resist unanimously. Bao also said that if there were no special matters, he planned to fly back north on the 24th. The full text of Rong Zhen's account is as follows: "The Shenyang incident this time was quite unexpected. At 10:00 PM on the 18th of this month, we heard a loud explosion north of Shenyang, followed by heavy gunfire. Shortly after, we received a report from our 7th Brigade at the North Camp that Japanese soldiers were attacking our barracks. Believing that the Japanese army was provoking trouble without cause, we decided to maintain a calm attitude and ordered our troops not to resist. Before long, the Japanese army broke into the camp, killing and wounding our soldiers. To uphold international trust, our army still adhered to the policy of non-resistance. However, the Japanese army drove and killed soldiers without restraint. Our army had no choice but to withdraw from the barracks, and the Japanese army set fire to them. By 12:00 AM, they were using field guns to bombard our North Camp, the mortar factory, and the arsenal. The arsenal had not sustained major damage until around 5:00 AM. The mortar warehouse was bombed and exploded, and the mortar factory was also occupied. Our officers and soldiers, as well as nearby residents, were unable to escape in time, resulting in many casualties. The exact number has not yet been determined. When the shelling first started, our negotiators immediately questioned the Japanese consul, who claimed that the reason was unknown. We requested that he quickly stop it within five minutes, but the Japanese consul requested another five minutes to handle the stopping procedures. At around 11:00 AM, the Japanese army's shooting continued as before, increasing rather than decreasing, and infantry also attacked the city of Shenyang. We negotiated with the Japanese consul again, but the Japanese consul replied that diplomatic officials could not directly stop military actions. However, the Japanese army continued to advance and did not stop at all. By 8:00 AM on the 19th, they had attacked and entered the city, first climbing the city walls and shooting inside, guarding the four city gates, disarming the military and police, occupying government offices, searching documents, arresting military officers, and searching private residences. All police stations inside and outside the city were attacked by Japanese machine guns. All occupied institutions were marked with signs saying 'Occupied by the Japanese Army; violators will be executed.' Our military and police absolutely did not resist, but a considerable number had already been tragically killed by gunfire. Many of the civilian officials who had not fled were also being monitored and could not move freely. Captured military officers were forced to sign statements admitting that our army had attacked first and destroyed their railway bridges. We took the opportunity to try to negotiate with them, but the Japanese army acted recklessly and disregarded our efforts. Later, we asked consuls from various countries to inquire about the reason for the atrocities, but the Japanese army claimed that the incident was due to our army's destruction of a bridge on the South Manchurian Railway. In fact, the explosive sound at the beginning of the incident was caused by the Japanese army themselves blowing up a small bridge on the South Manchurian Railway near the North Camp. The railway has double tracks, and they only blew up one track. What needs to be clarified? Our army has always tried to avoid conflict with the Japanese army. How could we have destroyed the bridges? They are making something out of nothing and deliberately fabricating lies. At around 9:00 AM, the gunfire had not stopped. The Japanese army claimed that there would be a definitive approach only after Commander Honjo arrived in Shenyang at noon. At 1:00 PM, Honjo indeed arrived in Shenyang and held a military meeting first. After the meeting, we asked if we could negotiate, but they replied that there was no need to negotiate with Chinese military and government officials. If it was for the sake of maintaining local order, representatives elected by the people could negotiate. At 1:00 PM, I went to Chairman Zang's residence to discuss everything. It happened that Japanese soldiers were guarding the back door of the residence, and plainclothes agents were monitoring the front door. I changed my clothes and sneaked out, entering a small household nearby. Afterwards, I moved frequently and changed my clothes. At night, I stayed in a small hotel. On the morning of the 20th, I sneaked into Zang's residence again. While we were talking, Japanese military police actually entered to search. Everyone there urged me to flee. With no other choice, I left Zang's residence and managed to sneak out of the city gate through small alleys. The inspection at the city gate was extremely strict. I was spared only because I had changed my clothes. I detoured to Huanggu Village, boarded a train to Ping. This is the general situation of what happened."</p>

<h3 id="e67">Tragic Situation of Shenyang under Occupation <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Report from Tianjin: The No. 102 train from Shenyang on the Beining Railway, which departed yesterday (the 19th), arrived in Tianjin at 5:00 PM today (the 20th). According to a passenger, Mr. So-and-so, he went from Tianjin to Shenyang on the 17th and arrived at Nanman Station at 8:00 AM the next morning, staying at the Jiaotong Hotel. He then took a car to visit friends. It rained lightly that day, followed by yellow fog and a black wind, as if foretelling a major disaster. Passing by the governor's office, the guards were unusually deserted. That afternoon, the passenger went to Huanggu Village with a friend for dinner at the Qi's residence. He went to bed slightly drunk. Around midnight, a friend from the transportation sector suddenly knocked on the door and entered, saying that something had happened at the North Camp, that the Japanese army had opened fire, and that the situation had become serious. Upon hearing this shocking news, the passenger was incredibly alarmed. By daybreak (the 19th), he knew that Shenyang had been occupied and boarded the No. 102 train to Shanhaiguan that afternoon. At the time, the train was incredibly crowded, the most ever seen on the Beining Railway. That night, while traveling in a certain location, bandits placed huge stones on the tracks in an attempt to derail the train and rob it. Fortunately, the driver was skilled at using the mechanism and managed to escape danger, but the engine was damaged. It continued to move forward only after repairs. It safely arrived in Tianjin today. The Northeast army retreated and gathered at Dahushan, numbering 30,000 to 40,000 men. He saw vehicles going inland along the way. He also saw 20,000 to 30,000 national troops when the train passed Xinmin Town. He heard that Japanese warships planned to land at Qinhuangdao, but stopped temporarily because ten warships from a certain country were following them.</p>
<p>According to a Mr. So-and-so from a certain agency in the Northeast who came to Tianjin from Liaoning, at dawn on the 19th of this month, the provincial capital of Liaoning heard gunfire. At that time, most people were sound asleep and were awakened from their dreams, thinking that the Japanese were practicing shooting again, not thinking of anything else. Unexpectedly, before long, they poured into the city, with a force of about one division. First, they occupied the North Camp, then they spread to Northeast University. All the students at the university were searched. All transportation facilities in the city, such as telegraph and telephone offices, were occupied. Afterwards, they divided their forces to guard various institutions. As a result, the North Camp and other places were burned down. The fire was most intense at the grain and forage factory and the clothing factory, and all kinds of debris were turned to ashes. Only a part of the arsenal was burned. At that time, the whole city was in a state of chaos. Ordinary citizens fled in a scramble, and many were tragically killed by bayonets. As for the local police and soldiers, because they were ordered not to resist, they were disarmed. The police, because they were responsible for maintaining local security, often directed their fellow citizens who were fleeing in all directions. The Japanese army considered this inappropriate and killed many of them. Statistics show that during the day and night of the 19th, about four to five hundred citizens and eighty to ninety policemen were killed or injured. After this barrage of gunfire, the Japanese army then redistributed their tasks. First, they burned down the Shenyang East Station and dismantled a section of the roadbed, because that road was the hub of the Shenhai intermodal transportation. The purpose was to cut off traffic on both roads. On the one hand, they also sent Japanese soldiers to distribute throughout the city. Whenever they went to a civil or military agency, they forced the people present to hand over all the property and files. Rong Zhen, the chief of the general staff, went to the Japanese consulate to negotiate and ask them to stop military action, but he was detained. At that time, Chairman Zang Shiyi was resting at his private residence, and many Japanese soldiers went to monitor him. It is heard that the Japanese released Rong today, but Chairman Zang is still not free. In addition, the former deputy director of the Beining Railway was also detained once. The residences of various important people were also guarded by the Japanese army, preventing them from entering and leaving. As for the personnel of various institutions, they were allowed to leave or stay as they pleased, but once they left, they were not allowed to enter again. By the afternoon of the 19th, all the institutions had been completely occupied by the Japanese army. In the evening, the order of the city was slightly restored. In addition to collecting firearms, the police were forced to change into civilian clothes and maintain order. The citizens in the city, feeling the obstruction of traffic, could not advance or retreat. Some were indignant and committed suicide. Those who were temporarily safe were also sighing in despair. Therefore, they all scrambled to flee to Huanggu Village, but many were stopped because the San Dong Bridge near Huanggu Village was guarded by the Japanese army, and they were not allowed to pass. Those who wore long gowns were especially obstructed. Those who wore short clothes like laborers could be slightly accommodated, and those who were able to pass, including us, were able to pass because we changed into short clothes. As for the destroyed roads, they were not allowed to be repaired. East-west traffic on the South Manchurian Railway was cut off. Judging from the current situation, the commercial port area in the northwest of Shenyang suffered the greatest loss. In addition to the destruction of most of the public construction, the private losses were even more difficult to calculate. The Shenyang Central Station building and various banks were all sealed off. Residents moved to inland areas in succession. Huanggu Village residents were also short of food, and everyone was eager for people from inland areas to provide relief as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Today, the 23rd, at 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the capital held an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly at the public sports field. More than ten thousand people from various sectors, including party, government, military, academia, agriculture, industry, commerce, women, and various popular organizations, participated. The atmosphere was fervent and indignant, with tears flowing freely, unprecedented in past events. The entire venue was filled with an intensely tense anti-Japanese sentiment. The various circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>Assembly Venue Situation: Party and national flags were crossed at the main entrance of the assembly venue.</p>
<p>Situation of the Opening of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly in the Capital</p>
<p>A high-hanging banner read: "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly of All Circles in the Capital." Armed police guards stood on both sides. The entire venue was filled with Boy Scouts maintaining order. After everyone stood in solemn silence, mournful music was played, and ceremonial rites were performed. After the opening speech by Zhou Bomin, Chairman of the Presidium, Lai Lian, Xiang Xueru, Tang Guozhen, Ni Guanghe, Mu Huaxuan, Zheng Luosheng, Zhang Mojun, and others successively gave speeches. Then the discussion of proposals began.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Speech: Today, everyone is gathered here for this citizens' assembly in the capital. This is because our eastern neighbor, Japan, has launched troops without cause, occupied our three northeastern provinces, invaded our national territory, and trampled on our national sovereignty. Their tyrannical actions are deeply distressing. Everyone must understand why violent Japan wants to invade China. It is because they are a small country with a small population, while China is vast and rich in resources with a large population. Therefore, Japan hopes to consume its domestic goods in China. In order to survive, violent Japan wants to invade Chinese territory, making it impossible for China to survive. To protect the territory of our ancestors, we must unite as one, to defeat Japanese imperialism. The reason why Japan is coveting and plotting to invade our country is also because of the internal strife in our country and the lack of unity. They saw our weakness and attacked us there. It can be proven that the Chinese people lack united strength. Recalling the past, whenever something happened, in the beginning, everyone was vigorous and passionate, but as time passed and the situation changed, they became indifferent. The current incident in the three northeastern provinces is not comparable to past events. We must permanently imprint in our minds that the enemy is violent Japan. Let us unite and strive for the survival of the Chinese nation in the world and overthrow Japanese imperialism. This is the meaning of today's meeting, and I hope everyone will remember it deeply.</p>
<p>Lai Lian's Speech: Fellow countrymen who are not yet dead, we used to say that Annam, India, Korea, and Burma were subjugated countries. Now, we ourselves are about to become subjugated slaves. Japan has already broken into our Chinese gate. The silent mourning for the compatriots who died in the Northeast just now made people cry sadly. This is because the opportunity for our death has arrived. How are we prepared to die? The only way is to overthrow Japanese imperialism before the country is subjugated. We only ask the central government to declare war on Japan. All the citizens of Nanjing should go to the front line, rush to Japan, and fight to the death. The three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory. Compatriots across the country should unite and be prepared to fight.</p>
<p>Emergency Proposal: Party members Wang Pichen, Luo Ciqi, Kuang Zhuosheng, and fifteen others put forward a very urgent proposal, requesting the central government to order the National Government to immediately dismiss and severely punish Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, who is selling out the country and flattering Japan, and to clarify the legal punishment. (Explanation) This time, Japan invaded and occupied the eastern provinces, and our army retreated step by step. All responsibility should be borne by Japan. However, when the international community inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting replied by telegram, claiming that it was a conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops, reducing Japan's responsibility and increasing China's shame. It seems that this is selling out the country and flattering Japan. There must be other intentions. Now, the Control Yuan has already proposed an impeachment for this matter. If this is not handled, internal traitors will not be eliminated, and how can the country be saved? The public opinion should be expressed to the central government, requesting the National Government to immediately detain Wang Zhengting, dismiss him, and severely punish him, clarifying the legal punishment, in order to punish corrupt officials and apologize to the Party and the country. We also implore the gentlemen of the Presidium not to suppress this case in order to protect Wang Zhengting's treasonous behavior, which would be abandoned by the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Organized Parade: After the proposal was passed, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Qiqing reported on the organization of the parade and demonstration, and a petition to the National Government. Parade route: (1) Party departments at all levels, (2) Administrative organs, (3) Public organizations, (4) Schools, (5) Free public organizations, (6) Military police. The route starts from the assembly venue, passes through Dazhong Bridge, Huaiqing Bridge, Yaojia Lane, Confucius Temple, Sixiang Bridge, Taiping Road, Yanggong Well, Erlang Temple, Beting Lane, to the National Government for a petition, and then disperses at Zhongshan Road. Along the way, Party Boy Scouts will serve as disciplinarians and shout slogans, which is extremely passionate.</p>
<p>Assembly Proposals: (1) Send a telegram to the whole country, urging everyone to unite, swear to resist Japan to the death, and jointly save the country from disaster. (2) Send a telegram to national party and government leaders, urging them to quell internal disputes, unite as one, and jointly resist violent Japan.

(12) Send a telegram to the whole country to stop entertainment. (13) Petition the central government to restore the people's movement to boost morale.

The wolf's ambition has reached this extreme. Such atrocities are not only the great enemy of the Chinese nation, but also the leader of the destruction of world peace. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? All circles in the Jiangsu Provincial Capital, based on the sense of responsibility for the rise and fall of the country, held an anti-Japanese national salvation assembly today. At the meeting, it was unanimously decided: (1) Telegraph the central government to seriously negotiate with Japan and make military preparations as soon as possible.

Respectfully, the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Anti-Japanese National Salvation Assembly."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Fortieth National Affairs Meeting <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Methods for Flood Relief Submitted to Departments for Review</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Appointed as Minister to the United States</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the Executive Yuan held its fortieth National Affairs Meeting. Song Ziwen, Wang Zhengting, Li Shuhua, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, and Liu Ruiheng attended. Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs, Chen Yi, Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, Lu Bichou, Secretary-General, and Xu Jingzhi, Director of Political Affairs, were present. Song Ziwen chaired the meeting. The matters discussed are as follows: (1) The proposal of the President of the Yuan, Chiang, stated that the current floods along the Yangtze River are unprecedented. In addition to fundamental dredging, the competent authorities should make comprehensive plans. As an immediate solution, the provincial governments should be instructed to thoroughly investigate the area and boundaries of the major lakes in their jurisdiction in the past, as well as the amount of encroachment by polders over time. The previous major floods broke through various polders. If they were newly built in the past sixty years since Minister to the United States Yan Huiqing</p>
<p>arrived and were indeed within the old lakebed, they should not be repaired again in order to return the fields to the lakes, restore their original state, and allow the rivers to have adequate storage space. The number of abandoned fields should be investigated, and future land taxes should be exempted. It is strictly forbidden to compete with the water for profit. Furthermore, water management cannot be effective without comprehensive planning for the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River. In the past, the various schemes for guiding the Huai River had proposals for draining the fields of Gaoyou, Baoying, and Shaobo Lakes, as well as disputes over diverting water into the sea or the river. Because the project of diverting water into the sea is larger, those who support diverting water into the river are in the majority. Based on the observation of this flood, greater flexibility should be added. While maintaining the original state of the lakes, although we still advocate both diverting water into the river and dredging the sea, we should start with diverting water into the sea first to ensure complete safety and avoid future troubles. The above two points are to be submitted to the competent authorities and the relevant provincial governments for consideration and handling. If there are concrete plans that should be stipulated, they should be drafted and submitted for approval and implementation. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. Resolution: Submit to the Ministers of Interior, Industry, and Transportation to convene experts and relevant agencies to review the matter jointly. (2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted the regulations of the National Sacrifice Problem Research Committee. Please review and submit for record. Resolution: Passed and submitted for record. (3) The Ministry of Military Affairs submitted the draft regulations for awarding commemorative medals for suppressing the Reds in the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the design of the commemorative medal; the draft regulations for issuing certificates to local militias; and the preferential treatment measures for members of the Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei militias who died in action while suppressing the Reds, and their families. Please review and submit for promulgation and implementation. Resolution: Submit to the Ministry of Interior for review. (4) Resolution: Wu Nanxuan, President of National Tsinghua University, submitted his resignation. Please approve it and appoint Mei Yiqi to succeed him. Before he arrives at the school, Weng Wenhao will continue to act as president. (5) Resolution: Wu Chaoshu, Minister to the United States, requested to resign. Please approve it and appoint Yan Huiqing to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>Telegram Requesting Severe Censure of Northeast Authorities: Qian Sunqing, chairman of the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, telegraphed the central government regarding the Northeast war, requesting severe censure of the responsible authorities in the Northeast to appease the nation. The telegram stated: "In this Northeast incident, the Japanese attributed it to local issues. However, the local authorities failed to fulfill their responsibility to defend the territory, and their fault is undeniable. They were negligent in their defense beforehand, and fled in panic when the incident occurred. They usually boasted of having troops to defend themselves, but not a single arrow was fired. National territory was handed over to the enemy with both hands, and countless people were killed and injured. Officials were humiliated and endured humiliation in order to survive. The enemy penetrated deep into our territory, and our territory shrank by hundreds of miles every day, while the commander-in-chief leisurely stayed in the old capital, almost forgetting what his position was. He lacked the fear of the three armies. Losing the army and disgracing the country is unprecedented. If there is any conscience left, they should commit suicide to show their determination. Otherwise, the national law should be strictly enforced to impeach them, so as to appease the nation. International relief should also be sought to protect the territory. Otherwise, the country will perish soon, and what diplomacy can be discussed? The central government should strictly order them by telegram to make meritorious deeds and serve the country. The lost territory should be recovered quickly, and the territory that has not been lost should be protected properly. Any retreat will be severely punished. This will boost morale and make amends for the lost sheep. We express our words with tears and trepidation."</p>
<p>County Police Team Repeatedly Captures Notorious Bandits: A notorious bandit who roams between Suzhou and Changzhou, nicknamed "Old Granny," has committed many crimes in the Changzhou area. She is good at disguise and particularly cunning. She can hold a gun with both hands, walk hunched over, and fire quickly to the left and right, hitting the target every time. Although the authorities have sent out many scouts, it is still difficult to capture her. Recently, due to a gang robbery case at the home of a certain family in Qishuyan, the police team has been strictly ordered to arrest her. She fled to Wuxi. The detectives You Quangen and Chen Shouwen of the Wujin Public Security Bureau, along with an informant, came to Wuxi to assist the Wuxi detectives in searching everywhere. They were captured in the No. 1 theater on Guangqin Road and taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. They were then escorted back to Changzhou for further investigation. Furthermore, according to a tip-off, the main suspect, Li Fuan, who robbed a policeman of his gun outside the South Gate last year, recently sneaked into Wuxi again. Chief Liao led the detectives to investigate and arrested him at the back door of the Qitai Inn in Changkangli. A wooden toy gun was found on him. The suspect was wearing a blue cloth gown and a felt hat. He was from Shouxian, Anhui. He confessed that he committed a crime at the Fifteen Hole Bridge in Changzhou on the 12th of this month and was pursued by the local security team. His wife, Li Xue, and four accomplices were captured. He fled to Wuxi. He also confessed that after robbing the gun in Wuxi last year, he went to Yichong to serve as a police officer. He fled shortly afterwards. He also has a boat, which was also seized in Changzhou.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Dismissal and Punishment of County Magistrate Who Suppresses Public Sentiment: After Wuxi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association received news of the Japanese troops attacking the eastern provinces, County Magistrate Chen Chuande immediately sent people to various newspapers to prevent the publication of anti-Japanese news. He also prevented people from participating in anti-Japanese work, pretending to be calm and suppressing public sentiment. The County Supervisory Committee has already decided to issue a warning. When all circles held a mass rally, more than 100,000 people participated, but not a single member of the county government attended and secretly obstructed it. They only know how to be officials and do not know how to love the country. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, requesting immediate dismissal and severe punishment to appease the public.</p>

<p>Sea Bandits Land and Burn and Kidnap: More than 300 sea bandits from Lüsi landed in Sanjia Town and robbed wildly. When fishermen refused to pay fees, they set fire to boats. The police and local militia went to intercept them. The bandits kidnapped Peng Shaoan and six women from the town and escaped by boat. The coastal area has recently been extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Judgment on the Discount of Cash Coins for Silver Dollars: The Nantong County Education Bureau deposited public funds in a money shop. When converting cash coins into silver dollars, they insisted on calculating the price of silver dollars according to the exchange rate at the time of deposit.

<p>Eleven Trade Associations Telegraph the Department to Oppose House Rent Surtax: The eleven trade associations of Jiangdu, including oil, sauce, firewood, inn, medicine, wide goods, silk, rice, tea food, and tea leaves, and southern goods, because of the County Political Conference, Finance Bureau Chief Dong Digu, proposed the method of levying house rent surtax for relief funds, collecting two months' rent to make up for the local budget deficit. It was decided to submit the detailed method to the Finance Bureau, convene all French for discussion, and then submit it to the Department for approval. The County Bureau also convened a meeting of various groups, agencies, and banks on the 14th to discuss the matter. The result of the discussion was that the house rent surtax should also be levied. Therefore, on the 21st, a joint meeting was held, deciding to telegraph Hu, the head of the Civil Affairs Department, on the 22nd, stating the merchants' difficulties and proposing that the principle of house rent surtax was based on the corrupt practices of warlords and should not be imitated under the Party's rule. Therefore, after a joint meeting of the trade associations, it was decided that before the house rent surtax is implemented, the Department should be telegraphed first, requesting Jiangdu County to forward the message to the Finance Bureau and dispel the original proposal for the house rent surtax.</p>

<p>Negligence of Duty Causes Death: Zhu Yunqiao, a resident doctor at the Zhang Zhen Dexintang Pharmacy, had previously prescribed the herb Asarum for Feng Jiucheng's 14-year-old son, Minyao, from Nanbu Village. He prescribed as much as two qian. After Minyao took it, his condition worsened drastically overnight, and he died. Jiucheng was heartbroken and asked the medical community to comment on the prescription. Everyone said that Asarum is a strong medicine, and adults can only use one qian at most. Now, a child over ten years old was given as much as two qian, so it was difficult to save his life. Feng became even more grief-stricken when he heard this. Recently, he hired a lawyer to draft a lawsuit against the county.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Suggestions for Concrete Implementation Methods for Elementary Schools to Resist Japan and Save the Nation <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>By Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>As the Japanese take advantage of our natural disasters and engage in violent acts, deploying troops to seize territory, news of these atrocities spreads, causing righteous indignation among all those with blood and breath. It is fitting that each person should express their views and fulfill their responsibilities, jointly devising methods to resist Japan and save the nation. Based on my observations and understanding within the education sector, I have drafted this article to express my personal desire to save the nation. I hope that comrades in elementary education across the country will continue to study, add to, and correct it. This method is conceived based on the actual environment of domestic elementary schools, focusing on practical application rather than theoretical discussion. It is now presented in the following sections:</p>
<p>(1) Teaching: Instruction should begin with the recent incident of the Japanese army's dispatch of troops to invade and occupy Fanyang, using "Researching Japan" as the central theme of teaching. Every effort should be made to integrate various subjects. For example, in the Chinese language class, select readings or review records or reports of the Japanese army's violence. In composition, children can be asked to write propaganda to encourage compatriots to rise up and resist Japan to save the nation. In social studies, the Japanese invasion plan and the history and geography of the Eastern Provinces and the South Manchurian Railway can be studied. In arithmetic, the area of the Eastern Provinces, the number of Japanese troops, and statistics on various losses in the Eastern Provinces can be calculated. In art, children can be asked to draw imaginative pictures of the Japanese army's violence, and to create various anti-Japanese propaganda. In natural science, the resources of the Eastern Provinces and South Manchuria, and the manufacture of bullets and gunpowder can be studied. In calligraphy, practice writing leaflets and slogans. In physical education, practice various anti-Japanese fitness exercises. In singing, sing various songs about joining the army or resisting Japan. The goal is to focus each subject on resisting Japan and saving the nation, imperceptibly achieving anti-Japanese training in teaching. The above is just a brief example, and of course, can be varied and adapted as needed.</p>
<p>(2) Training: Several ideas have come to mind; here is one example: 1. Report on the Japanese army's violence and active national salvation methods during memorial weeks.</p>
<p>2. Hold morning meetings every day to report to all children on the investigation of various Japanese goods.</p>
<p>3. Class teachers should talk regularly, promoting active national salvation methods to children.</p>
<p>4. Edit children's wall newspapers, making full use of pictures to arouse their enthusiasm for resisting Japan and saving the nation.</p>
<p>5. Train children to actively save money to save the nation. Set up a "saving money" fund in each class, using competitions to encourage them to save pocket money and cultivate the habit of saving. This saving money still belongs to each individual child, and should be deposited in a reliable local bank for special protection, to be used when urgently needed to save the nation.</p>
<p>6. Actively train children to endure hardship, using competition to motivate them.</p>
<p>7. Actively promote healthy exercise for children, using competition to promote it.</p>
<p>8. Stipulate a minimum level of fitness. Students who do not meet the corresponding passing standard will not be promoted or graduate.</p>
<p>9. Hold essay or speech contests, with specific plans to resist Japan and save the nation as the central topic.</p>
<p>(3) Teaching Materials: Here is an example of what has come to mind. Detailed teaching materials for resisting Japan and saving the nation should be edited and distributed.</p>
<p>(1) Nursery rhymes: List the facts of the Japanese army's violence in the Eastern Provinces and compile them into nursery rhymes.</p>
<p>(2) Supplementary teaching materials: Compile the Japanese plans to invade Manchuria and Mongolia and the circumstances of the recent Japanese army riots into supplementary teaching materials, with one incident as one topic, compiled into a small booklet. The language should be simple and clear so that children can read freely.</p>
<p>(3) Scripts: Compile the recent sudden occupation of Liaoji by Japanese soldiers into scripts for elementary school students to perform.</p>
<p>(4) Stories: In the lower grades, stories can be compiled for teachers to use as reference lectures. In the higher grades, they can be used as extracurricular reading material.</p>
<p>(4) Administration: The principal should formulate a teaching calendar for resisting Japan and saving the nation, proceeding daily without any steps being missed. Here is an example of what has come to mind:</p>
<p>(1) Stipulate the central training issue for each day and notify teachers to implement it.</p>
<p>(2) Stipulate the order of faculty meetings and the central points of discussion.</p>
<p>(3) Stipulate the steps and methods for visiting guest families and implement them regularly.</p>
<p>(4) Stipulate the steps for teaching and training and implement them in stages.</p>
<p>(5) Stipulate the number of children's gatherings and the key points of their talks.</p>
<p>(6) Stipulate methods for checking children's health and the steps for carrying them out.</p>
<p>(7) Compile tests to measure the results after implementation.</p>
<p>(8) Conduct regular liaison with other schools and implement active and concrete methods.</p>
<p>(9) Review various anti-Japanese and national salvation teaching materials.</p>
<p>(10) Stipulate other emergency steps and plan for them regularly.</p>
<p>The various methods listed above, whether for urban or rural schools, should not encounter any difficulties in practice. However, how to adapt them to the actual environment of each school will naturally require careful consideration and change. The author is only promoting a method or using it to stimulate further research by experts to obtain more concrete and active methods to resist Japan and save the nation, which is the only hope.</p>

However, they still endure the pain and maintain calm, because they want to see if international law is effective and whether the non-war treaty can be implemented. Today, the Japanese army is even more reckless and has entered the country, and Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Xiamen have all fallen into their hands, creating an unprecedented act in the international arena and an unprecedented humiliation for our country. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Although we students are young and inexperienced, we deeply know that at this time of national disintegration, it is better to fight to survive than to endure and die. Therefore, we unanimously decided to request the government to immediately send troops to declare war on Japan, and we students swear to be in the vanguard and will not hesitate to die as war ghosts rather than become slaves of a subjugated country. You gentlemen bear the heavy responsibility of the country, and the survival of the nation is at stake. You should be able to unite to resist foreign aggression, fight for the survival of the country, and be pioneers for the people. Please do not rely on the international law that has no power and no courage, hesitate and delay, and let the country and the nation fall into an abyss of no return. Urgent words, sincerely and fearfully, from all 1,250 students of the Shanghai Municipal Wu Ben Girls' Middle School."</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Thoughts of Overseas Chinese Students in Japan on the National Games <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>| Busy Raising Funds to Relieve Flood Disasters | Difficult to Raise Funds Again Due to Economic Downturn |</p>
<p>Baseball's Inability to Return Home is a Pity</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent) Last spring, the Kobe Chinese YMCA basketball team participated in the grand event of the first National Games, which was well received by the government and sports circles. After returning to Japan, they trained even harder and their skills improved rapidly. Last winter, in the Hanshin area, they repeatedly defeated Kansai Gakuin, Kobe Westerners, and Konan High School and other strong teams, winning the championship for three consecutive years, bringing glory to our overseas Chinese. In the early summer of this year, when Santo Tomas from the Philippines came to Japan, the Japan Basketball Association selected the Chinese YMCA team to compete with them, which proves that its strength is also deeply recognized by the Japanese. This time, the second National Games have been postponed frequently. The overseas Chinese feel distressed about the tragic damage caused by the floods in their motherland, and they believe that it is imperative to help compatriots in need. Although it is a time of economic downturn, they are all actively raising funds. A few days ago, the Consul General in Hanshin received a telegram from the National Games Organizing Committee, asking whether there were any overseas Chinese representatives participating. After careful discussion by those with lofty ideals in the sports world, it was concluded that it is appropriate to express condolences and sympathy for the disasters in the motherland. The original plan to send baseball and basketball teams back to the country to attend was shelved. The attitude of the decision is commendable. I wonder what the people in the country feel.</p>
<p>However, the most regrettable thing is that the overseas Chinese baseball team cannot return to the country and bury their good skills overseas. Overseas Chinese students in Japan have always been fond of this skill, and the team has a prestigious history. In recent years, stimulated by the progress of the Japanese, they have studied more seriously and trained harder. To be fair, their baseball skills are better than the Xiangshan Chinese team. To date, outstanding talents who have returned to the country and shown their skills in Hong Kong and Shanghai include Li Chenglan, Guo Rixian, and Zeng Guangbang. Others, such as the veterans Zhao Shilun, Huang Jiaojian, and Zhang Wu, although they have retired, were also fierce generals on the field in the past. Currently, Liu Sezhang (Hosei University) and Bao Guanda (Nanjing Institute of Technology) in Yokohama, the Cui brothers Ri Guang and Ri Fu (Yokohama Commercial), and Liang Wuxiong (St. Joseph's College) are all young student athletes. Others, such as Liang Chengsong, Bao Hui, and Zheng Sipei (pitcher), Zeng Guangchao (shortstop), Zheng Bohan (outfielder), and He Jinben (third baseman) of the Kobe Chinese team, although they have joined the business world, are still young and strong, and their skills are extraordinary. If we combine the elites of the two ports to organize an overseas Chinese baseball team in Japan to participate in the second National Games in Nanjing, the championship will definitely be won. Therefore, since the Japanese overseas Chinese cannot attend, the domestic teams in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tianjin must not be complacent and complacent. I hope that everyone will work hard to promote the development of this skill and prepare for the challenge of the Japanese overseas Chinese next year or the year after. The future is bright, and I hope that all people in the baseball world will work together.</p>

<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, this is not the time for singing and dancing. The violent Japanese soldiers have already invaded our land, plundered our property, and massacred our compatriots. Do you have a heart and blood? Then you should emulate Goujian and work together to sleep on brushwood and taste gall.</p>
<p>Those Who Do Not Eliminate the Weeds in the Courtyard Merely Engage in Empty Talk</p>
<h3 id="e98">Tolstoy and the Followers of Muhammad <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yue Wumu said: "If civil officials do not love money and military officials do not fear death, the world will be at peace." This time, the Japanese violated international law and invaded the Northeast with heavy troops, which is no less than an act of robbery. Military officials should be as willing to die as they are to defend the country and protect the people. Who knew that some military officials would adopt a policy of non-resistance and become followers of Tolstoy. Ask him: "If the Japanese soldiers occupy Shenyang, will you not resist?" He said, "Do not resist!" Ask him: "If the Japanese soldiers occupy Jilin, will you not resist?" He said, "Do not resist!" Ask him: "If the Japanese soldiers want you, your parents, wives, children, and friends to be slaves, will you not resist?" He said, "Do not resist!" Ask him: "If the Japanese soldiers bury all the Chinese alive in mass graves, will you not resist?" He said, "Do not resist!" What a thorough follower of Tolstoy! But he is following Muhammad's tactics with his own family, holding the Koran in his left hand and a sword in his right to suppress his compatriots. On that sword, the blood of his fifteen- or sixteen-year-old younger brother has not yet dried!</p>
<h3 id="e99">American Silver Also Sees Contraction P] <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>

<p>Tightening Money Market</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the current political situation, the money market has experienced an emergency in recent days. Because of the general trend, we have not dared to fully discuss the inner workings of this tightening situation, fearing that it would attract attention and cause misunderstandings, leading to special disturbances. At a time of national crisis, financial panic is inevitable. It is fortunate that those in charge are doing their best to maintain stability.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Although the Financial Industry Does Its Best to Absorb and Maintain the Market, How Can the Declining Trend Be Reversed? The Rate of Decline Is Becoming More Severe <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 23rd), the situation of various prices in the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange market was that, due to the continuous invasion of the Japanese army and the expansion of our country's territory, the extent of their looting and massacres was even greater than before. All constructions in the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin were destroyed. Diplomatic contact has become impossible. War clouds are dense, and a breakdown may be unavoidable, and this may involve international relations, which makes the danger even greater. The securities market is in such an environment that it is difficult to recover in a short time. When the market opened yesterday morning, people were in a vacuum, and the market was selling off universally. The selling and resale transactions were like a tidal wave, and the tension and seriousness of the market were no less than last weekend. All bonds were under pressure, and all fell sharply. If there had not been a large amount of short covering and the financial industry in Shanghai had not done its best to absorb and maintain the market, then the bonds would have fallen and trading would have been suspended in the morning. However, because the salt tax in September fell too much, trading was suspended, and the after-market was extended to 5 pm due to the need to chase the evidence. At that time, the people in the market were as panicked as before, and there was no slight change in the bond market environment. The market prices of various bonds became even lower than the previous market trend, which led to almost all bonds falling and trading being suspended. Only a few types, such as the 96 series of disarmament bonds due next month and the 10 series of troop reduction bonds with September tariff, did not fall to the point of suspension. However, after the suspension of trading, although there were dark market transactions among brokers, there was not much to be heard, and the price was static, only about half a yuan around the suspension price. It is still not optimistic to view the bond market situation. The trend will depend on whether there is a turnaround in the diplomatic situation. It is estimated that the total transaction volume of futures for the whole day reached about 32 million yuan, and there was no market for spot goods.</p>

<p>Brisk Buying in the Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market</p>
<p>The yarn market is unusually chaotic, with a mixed and confusing situation, and prices are rising and falling unevenly, but the buying trend is very strong. Due to the economic severance with Japan, the trading of local yarn has greatly improved, so people are shaken, and Japanese merchants are massively buying to cover short positions, and the market is becoming increasingly tight. However, a certain major merchant has slightly sold to flatten the market price, but this trend is difficult to calm down in a short time.</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" (Human Standard) Traders Rush to Cover Short Positions</p>
<p>At the opening of the "Ren Biao" market, due to the Japanese army's invasion of Northeast China, people's spirits were high, and Japanese merchants were buying to cover short positions, with prices rising by 3, 4, and 5 taels in each month. In the second session, a large trader sold, and the market price fell sharply by 3 taels. The result was an increase of 1 tael and 7 or 8 qian. In the afternoon, the situation was slightly calmer, with the near months rising by 2 or 4 qian. The trading volume totaled 80,000 bales. The trading volume in the afternoon was not recorded. It was found that the sales were: Mei Ji 300 bales, Rong Xing over 2,700 bales, Ming Hua 1,150 bales, Heng De 1,250 bales, Shen Ji 2,600 bales, Yi Chang 1,150 bales, Yi Yu 1,950 bales, Xin Cheng 4,150 bales, and De Ji 1,050 bales. The purchases were: Rui Da 10,750 bales, Da Fu 1,450 bales, Da Feng 1,150 bales, Gong Da 3,800 bales, Tian Jiang 2,500 bales, Shen Chang 1,850 bales, Chang Feng 3,900 bales, and Yong Chang 1,250 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>"Ren Biao" Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Inventory</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Still Brisk</p>
<p>The yarn sales are still brisk. It was found that the total purchases by various syndicates for the whole day were 2,450 bales, and 700 bales were traded among colleagues. The market is trending upward. Customer syndicates: Guangdong 1,040 bales, inland 750 bales, Sichuan 125 bales, Jiangxi 250 bales, Ningbo 35 bales, Hankou 150 bales, miscellaneous syndicates 200 bales. Yihua Factory opened at 20 counts, Five Blessings Shepherd, 5,000 bales, pulling price 172 taels, delivery in October, November, and December.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Rises Sharply in the Evening Session</p>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning, but trended upward in the afternoon. The market atmosphere was very chaotic, but American cotton continued to be depressed, and gold prices were also softening. Moreover, the selling price of foreign cotton was very cheap, so large speculators continued to sell. However, the yarn market was firm, and the cotton market was driven by it. Most retail investors, fearing that the Japanese army's violent invasion of Northeast China would expand the trend and foreign cotton could not be imported, purchased more to go long. However, foreign cotton prices are very cheap, and the outlook is still mostly bearish.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" (Hankou Standard) Up 3, 4, and 5 Qian</p>
<p>At the opening of the "Han Biao" market, American cotton was flat, and the market atmosphere was weak, with prices falling by 5 fen in each month. At the close in the afternoon, prices rose sharply by 3 or 4 qian. The transaction volume was 83,700 dan in the morning, and the transaction volume in the afternoon was not recorded. It was found that the sales were: Geng Feng 6,000 dan, Rui Da 3,400 dan, Yi Chang 2,600 dan, Yi Yu 3,100 dan, Xin Cheng 2,500 dan, Yuan Da 3,000 dan, He Shen 2,300 dan, and Heng Yi 2,900 dan. The purchases were: Ji Feng 4,300 dan, Yu Liu 8,000 dan, Chang Feng 8,000 dan, and Shen Chang 3,100 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Cotton Transactions Quiet and Unheard Of</p>
<p>There were no transactions of current cotton. The source was estimated to be 3,802 bales of Yao flower.</p>
<p>Global Cotton Yarn Prices Fall More Than Rise</p>
<p>American Cotton Is Firm Due to Short Covering: Yesterday, American cotton was firm because Liverpool bought in and there was a shortage of sellers. Futures rose by 3 to 7 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 7 or 8 points, and spot prices fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm because brokers and Japanese merchants bought in. Pingle fell by 0.5 rupee, Omla fell by 0.25 rupee, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.75 rupee.

<p>Grain: River Rice Drop, Wind Temporarily Settled</p>
<p>The sources from Nantou yesterday were not many, and the remaining stock in the docks was also scarce. The sales in urban and rural stores turned slack, and fresh goods were slightly moving. The market for thick japonica rice was settled. Although there were not many thin indica rice goods, the buyers were still sluggish. Only the freshest rice was picked in this street, and the middle-grade rice was still sluggish, causing the price to fall. However, considering the long distance between inside and outside, there may be a hope of stabilization. The market for old Luoyang glutinous rice was weak, and the goods were also sporadic, temporarily presenting a flat image. The market for new Luoyang glutinous rice was firm due to the sharp price drop. The market for new japonica rice was rare and sales were weak.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, due to the unfavorable weather, goods arrived on the 20th or 30th of the month, and the trend was declining. Thick japonica rice and early and late indica rice opened at a higher price of 2 jiao in the morning. Due to the continuous sharp drop in the price of new Luoyang glutinous rice, the arrival of goods must be scarce, and the market was stable. The market for old Dujiang glutinous rice was slightly active, but the buyers were also sluggish, and the situation was downstream. There was a very strong demand for general transformation of Yuan tea food stores, and the situation was firm.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Market Turns Better in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for foreign rice was flat, and the futures market turned better because foreign firms received large telegrams and the exchange rate was slightly higher. Therefore, the market turned better after being weak in the morning. However, due to the national crisis, importers had no intention of doing business smoothly. Tianxiang telegrammed that 1,000 tons of small pressed rice would arrive in November at a price of 5 taels and 6 qian, but no large syndicates bought it in large quantities. The asking price for the returned goods in September was still low for small pressed rice, at 5 taels and 6 qian to 5 taels and 5 qian and 7 fen, totaling 300 tons. 100 tons of small pressed rice in October were priced at 5 taels and 6 qian and 8 fen, which was 8 fen higher for larger rice. The spot price for small pressed rice was 300 packages, priced at 12 yuan and 1 jiao, and Hunan Yuan rice was 287 packages, priced at 14 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour Market In A Drifting State</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a rise in the price of foreign wheat at the opening, with certain factories and outside buyers exhibiting strong buying interest. Prices rose consistently across all months, increasing by 1.5 fen to 0.5 fen compared to the previous day's close. The market sentiment was very positive, suggesting a continued upward trend. However, after the price increase, small and medium-sized factories, as well as many large speculators, seized the opportunity to sell, causing the market to level off again. Yet, before the close, large factories made purchases, resulting in another price reversal. The closing prices showed a 0.5 li increase for the current month, a 5 fen increase for October, and a 1 fen increase across November to February.</p>
<p>Wheat Rises in the Morning, Returns in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning opening, prices for near and distant months of wheat rose in tandem. This was due to new and outside long positions in the distant months, and rumors of Hangzhou and Shaoxing buyers taking delivery of 200 carloads in the near months. The price of foreign wheat also rose by 1 or 2 jiao, leading to positive market sentiment and increases of around 5 fen across all months. Before the afternoon close, Runde and other firms newly arrived with a ship of foreign wheat and actively sold it into the market, particularly focusing on the current month. This resulted in an immediate drop in the current month, with other months also softening. The closing prices showed a decrease of 1 fen for the current month, an increase of 1 fen for October, an increase of 3 fen for November, and increases of 2 fen for December and January, with February up by 4 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Trade Quietly</p>
<p>Taikoo Drawings Turn Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw stable signals from producing regions. The price of Cuban spot sugar remained at 1.40625. New York sugar futures were 1.29 for September, 1.29 for December, and 1.32 for March of next year, showing no change compared to previous telegrams. May was at 1.37, down by 1 fen. The price of Javanese spot and futures sugar also remained unchanged. The exchange's drawings trade remained quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white sold for 11 taels 3 qian 7 fen and a half, while No. 20 medium white sugar sold for 10 taels 9 qian and a half. Old goods were rarely inquired about, and the trend was generally stable. Taikoo sugar saw a slight increase in demand, with B mark priced at 11 taels 9 qian 7 fen and a half, DY mark at 11 taels 9 qian, HX mark at 11 taels 8 qian and a half, HM mark at 11 taels 4 qian 7 fen and a half to 6 fen 2 li and a half, and H mark at 10 taels 5 qian. Shipments were few, and the market was quite brisk. Numbered trade was also quiet. In terms of offloaded goods, Tianxiang Trading sold 200 tons of high-quality old raw white sugar for October shipment, priced at 5 yuan and 6 jiao in Dutch currency, new rules plus tax, with the market being flat and lacking vitality.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Goods: The Downtrend of Honey Dates is Set</p>
<p>Honey dates have been slightly scarce in recent deliveries. However, the existing stock on the market is considered sufficient, and sales from various parties continue to be processed. As such, the market image is gradually stabilizing. Yesterday, the top-grade Hui-made "tu-tu" dates sold for 29 taels, and Lanxi "tu-tu" dates sold for 25 taels. The prices for higher and lower grades remained consistent with past practices. The post-market is not expected to be overly loose.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Autumn Silkworm Cocoon Harvest in Changzhou and Wuxi Difficult to Abound</p>
<p>Unified Pull is No More Than Four Tenths of a Normal Year</p>
<p>Changzhou and Wuxi have long been known as prominent silkworm farming regions. Each year, the autumn silkworm quota is generally more abundant than in other counties. Although the silkworm egg supply was strong this year, the early silkworms suffered damage from continuous rain, and the late silkworms faced a major crisis of leaf scarcity due to the mulberry trees being submerged by water. Most of the silkworms in the strong leaf supply starved to death. Even those who managed to spin cocoons generally climbed the mountains hungry, with insufficient leaf consumption and thin, inferior cocoons. This year, the cocoon production in Changzhou and Wuxi is unified at no more than four tenths of a normal year.</p>
<p>Autumn Silkworm Pull Price in Zhejiang Not Cheap</p>
<p>In the cocoon regions of Hangzhou and Shaoxing in Zhejiang, although the autumn silkworm egg supply was not weak this year, the rainfall caused problems, and the cocoon production was still poor, unified at no more than three tenths of a normal year. The cocoon firms have been weighing and receiving for over ten days, and the amounts received have been very limited. Cocoon prices are not cheap because there are few goods and many firms, leading to competition for purchases. The average cocoon price in Hangzhou and Shaoxing is at least 62 or 63 yuan, and the cocoons are still of good quality. The cocoon market is gradually coming to an end.</p>
<p>Hardware Prices Rise Due to Sterling's Increase</p>
<p>Due to rumors of the British government suspending the gold standard, the British exchange rate has risen sharply in recent days, and the sterling rate in this port has also increased accordingly. As such, hardware merchants in this port who have not yet settled their exchange bills are all delighted. However, the prices of hardware from overseas have suddenly soared at this time. The market prices of copper, tin, and lead have all risen significantly and extraordinarily. Although transactions are not numerous, the sentiment is very strong. The incoming market information is recorded below for industry reference:</p>
<p>Commodity Type Cargo Period Price Per Ton</p>
<p>Standard Copper Spot 30 Pounds 0.0625</p>
<p>Again Futures 31 Pounds 375</p>
<p>Electrical Copper Spot 36 Pounds</p>
<p>Futures 37 Pounds</p>
<p>Point Tin Spot 117 Pounds 9375</p>
<p>Again Futures 120 Pounds 5625</p>
<p>Blue Lead Near-Term Futures 12 Pounds 75</p>
<p>Again Long-Term Futures 12 Pounds 8125</p>
<p>White Lead Near-Term Futures 12 Pounds 25</p>
<p>Again Long-Term Futures 12 Pounds 625</p>
<p>Arrival of British Thin Black Iron Expected</p>
<p>Since the inability to transport and export East Black Iron, all syndicates have been sending letters requesting the loading of British goods. However, after the market in this port was controlled by East goods, British goods had long disappeared. As such, the request from each syndicate for loading has been difficult to fulfill. Therefore, colleagues, in view of this, have all begun to order British goods. According to foreign firm news, 600 or 700 bundles of thin goods are expected to arrive next month. It is said that over 200 bundles have been approved, with the price being 16 taels and 7 qian and a half per bundle, which has been approved by the syndicates along the Yangtze River and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The Selling Price of Unprocessed Biji (Wool Fabric) Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Woolen goods and fabrics are currently in their prime selling season. Unprocessed, navy blue, gray, and miscellaneous colored biji are particularly popular. Local merchants are actively seeking to purchase them. The most popular color is the raw blue color. They are generally willing to trade if paired with other colors. Those who want to exclusively purchase the raw color are willing to add several fen of silver per yard because the inventory on the market is extremely scarce. Even those who purchase whole boxes are only allowed to pair two or three bolts. As such, there are sometimes three different price points. For example, the same brand of biji, paired with bare raw color, must be sold for 3 taels and 6 qian and a half, two yuan two sui two blue 2 taels and 6 qian, and bare gray color is sold for a reduced price of 2 taels and 5 qian and a half.</p>
<p>Coal: Changxing Coal Demand Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>After the Changxing Coal Mine started producing coal, the coal usage in the surrounding areas was supplied by this mine. Due to convenient transportation and low prices, the demand exceeds the supply. This year, in response to the needs of Shanghai, it has been sold in Shanghai, exclusively by the Yitai Hing Coal Company in this port. This coal is very suitable for the fuel of factory kilns, and the price is also low. Currently, the market price for Changxing blocks is 11 taels and a half, Changxing Unified is 8 taels and 7 qian and a half, Guangxing is 12 taels and a half, and Guangxing Selected is 9 taels and 7 qian and a half.</p>

<p>The Whole City Mourns, Atmosphere Tense</p>
<p>Telegraph to Beijing and Guangdong for Unity Against Japan</p>
<p>And Please Vice-Zhang To Actively Prepare For War</p>
<p>Yesterday, the entire city lowered flags in mourning, and public sentiment was so indignant that it was almost unbearable. All kinds of propositions are compiled as follows.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Entire City Lowered Flags in Mourning</p>
<p>All stores, schools, and organizations in the northern and southern parts of the city uniformly lowered flags to half-mast yesterday. The light rain in the afternoon added to the somber atmosphere. Entertainment venues such as Xiaoshijie, Shenxian Shijie, Xinxin, Yong'an, Sincere, rooftop gardens, Gengxin Wutai, Da Wutai, the Lush Exhbition, as well as the Golden, Central, New Central, Carter, China, Empire, International, World, Shanghai and other theaters, were all closed. All citizens wore black armbands to express their condolences.</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee</p>
<p>Sent Two Important Telegrams Yesterday</p>
<p>Please Vice-Zhang to Actively Prepare for War</p>
<p>Please Guangdong to Join Forces to Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department received a telegram from Vice Commander Zhang, reporting the continued occupation of Yingkou, Andong, Changchun, and other places by the Japanese army. They immediately telegraphed back to Zhang yesterday, requesting him to order war preparations and announce the important documents submitted by the Japanese side. They also telegraphed the responsible persons in Guangdong, asking them to abandon their past grievances and join forces to resist foreign aggression. Each telegram is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Telegram from Vice-Zhang (Abridged Title)</p>
<p>The entire process of the Japanese army's occupation of Shenyang has been reported in the Hao Day telecomunication. Based on reliable reports, the Japanese army has taken similar actions in Yingkou, Andong, Changchun, and other places. Andong was occupied at 6 a.m. on Qiao Chen, and Yingkou and Changchun were occupied at 8 a.m. on Hao Chen. The Chinese military police and armed forces in each city were disarmed. Detailed information is still being gathered by secret agents. Respectfully reported, Zhang Xueliang Hao, You.</p>
<p>Telegram to Vice-Zhang (Most Urgent)</p>
<p>To Vice Commander Zhang Hanqing, Beiping. Your telegram has been respectfully noted. Disregarding international law and destroying East Asian peace, the Japanese army took advantage of our natural disasters and banditry, suddenly sending troops to the Northeast, forcibly occupying Liaoning and Jilin, and invading Pingjin. The alarming news has aroused indignation. This extraordinary event is not only related to the survival of our country, but also destroys public law. The people of this city are filled with righteous indignation, feeling the pain as if it were their own. They are willing to make a firm determination to fight a protracted struggle. In addition to telegraphing the central government to quickly transfer troops to recover lost territory and consolidate national defense, and telegraphing Guangdong to abandon their past grievances and jointly face national difficulties, we urge you to order your troops to actively prepare for war, and not to retreat again, bringing shame to our country. Also, publicly announce the important documents submitted by the Japanese side, so that the whole world may know the truth of the matter. The comrades and compatriots of this city are filled with boiling blood and are willing to be the government's backing. This is a special reply to the telegram. Please consider it carefully. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangdong</p>
<p>To Mr. Gu Xiangqin in Guangzhou, for all comrades. Japan has been plotting to invade our country for more than a day. They will proceed from occupying the Northeast to the Central Plains. This time, they took advantage of our natural disasters and banditry, suddenly sending troops, forcibly occupying Liaoning and Jilin, and invading Pingjin. Wherever the enemy's atmosphere reaches, the people are killed, their homes are burned, our military and civilian officials are captured, and our barracks and factories are seized. Public reason is treated as trash, human life is treated as grass, and the savagery is like madness. The alarming news has come, and all those with blood and breath, who can tolerate it? At this time, with national difficulties before us, at a critical moment, if we do not use the united strength of the whole country to take action to resist foreign insults, then there will be no intact eggs under the overturned nest. Since all comrades claim to be of the same party and country, how can there be more contention at this</p>

<p>Reader's Correspondence: Mr. Shen Tianbao's Message (Opposing Non-Resistance Against Japan)</p>
<p>Reports state that the Japanese are invading eastern provinces, committing extreme atrocities. Anyone with a sense of honor cannot help but be enraged. It has been three days since the incident occurred, yet no effective measures have been heard from the authorities in the eastern provinces. Instead, they have adopted a policy of non-resistance, the purpose of which is truly unknown. If they believe that now is not the time to contend with the Japanese, then when the ancestral tombs are dug up and houses are destroyed, when will they resist? If the Chinese army is currently unable to resist the Japanese, then in this critical time of survival, resistance may lead to destruction, but non-resistance also leads to destruction. Rather than passively waiting for death, wouldn't it be better to fight with a do-or-die spirit? If it is feared that resistance will provoke international disputes and complicate diplomatic relations, then if others unjustly attack us, we will respond with legitimate self-defense. What is wrong with that? Why give other countries an excuse for criticism? Alas, when Jinyang falls, they ask about hunting grounds, and when the Western Capital is destroyed, they ask who will be beheaded. When enemy soldiers arrive in force, they dare not even shoot a single arrow. This is like wild beasts worshiping hunters and begging for mercy. Is that possible? Your newspaper has always been a guide for society and a voice for the people. We hope for a response in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) A policy of non-resistance is something that those without strength or courage are forced to adopt. How can a grand nation with political and military power resort to this? If one province is occupied and there is no resistance, and then ten provinces are occupied and there is still no resistance, wouldn't that be the end? Alas, we firmly believe that the authorities will not willingly adopt a policy of non-resistance. However, before resisting, there must be various preparations. Exactly how to resist, who should resist, and with what should they resist are all problems. What we lament is not the current non-resistance, but the lack of preparation for resistance in ordinary times. As current citizens, we have no other choice but to urge everyone to quickly rise up. Please read yesterday's column in response to Mr. Shen Genghui's message. If you think it is correct, everyone should make a firm determination to act.</p>
<p>Revenue Stamp Notice: Municipal Government Inquires to Jiangsu Provincial Government to Lift Grain Ban in Liyang</p>
<p>The municipal government, based on a report submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau, stated that the Liyang County government's ban on grain exports was affecting the city's food supply. It immediately sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the county to lift the ban. It is expected that normal circulation will resume soon, ensuring that the city's grain supply is not affected.</p>
<p>Arsenal Experiences Second Fire</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal in Gaochangmiao experienced a fire at 3:10 AM yesterday morning. The fire broke out unexpectedly in the gun factory behind the arsenal's office building. The fire blazed fiercely. Fire engines from various parts of southern Shanghai rushed to the scene upon receiving the news. However, due to the late hour and the area being a military stronghold, they were unable to enter. Later, the arsenal's security team investigated and allowed them to enter for firefighting. Three buildings and approximately 600 yuan worth of timber stored inside were burned down. The fire was extinguished by dawn. Fortunately, the machinery factory was not affected. Yesterday, the arsenal's director, Mr. Guo Chengen, stated that a fire had occurred in the artillery factory just over ten days ago. This was the second fire. An investigation revealed that the factory only had workers during the day and no one stayed overnight. Given the late hour, even if there were lingering embers, they should not have been delayed for so long before igniting. The sudden fire, occurring twice in such a short period, is particularly strange. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he summoned the directors of the gun and artillery factories, as well as Mr. Wu Shihong, the head of the inspection department, to the North Station for discussions. On one hand, he instructed the arsenal's security team to conduct a thorough investigation, fearing that saboteurs were hiding within. Therefore, since the night before last, all security measures within Gaochangmiao have been tightened compared to the past.</p>
<p>Yingkou Customs Salt Tax Returned</p>
<p>It was previously reported that the Yingkou Customs salt tax was seized by the Japanese army. The Bank of China received a telegram from its Dalian branch yesterday, reporting that the customs salt tax had been fully returned by the Japanese army and was still being managed by the receiving bank.</p>
<p>Commentary Weekly Publishes Special Issue on Japanese Invasion</p>
<p>Tanaka's Conspiracy to Annex Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>The China Review Weekly is the best English newspaper run by Chinese people and serves as a voice for the Chinese people to the outside world. It has been published for four years. Recently, due to Japan's military aggression in the Northeast, the entire country is filled with anger. At this critical moment of survival, it is necessary to widely publicize the urgency of the national salvation movement, to inform the friendly countries the brutal truth about the Japanese. It has published a special issue on Japanese invasion, with very rich content, and includes the full text of the "Tanaka Memorial," which everyone should read. Each copy is still sold for two dimes, and the annual subscription is seven yuan. It is said that the newspaper has collected a wealth of materials on Japanese brutality, and it will continue to publish special issues next week.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese from Mexico to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The expulsion of Chinese from Mexico is unbearable. The first group of overseas Chinese returning from Mexico, totaling 184 people, has sailed from Mexico to New York, and then transferred to the President Monroe of the Dollar Steamship Line to Shanghai. Yesterday, a telegram was received in Shanghai stating that the overseas Chinese had arrived in Kobe, Japan. Upon hearing about the Japanese invasion of their homeland and the loss of the eastern provinces, they were all filled with grief and indignation. As a result, they stayed on the ship and did not disembark. They have now left Japan on the original ship and are expected to arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 28th) morning. The ship is expected to enter the port before 8:00 AM and proceed to the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong, where the overseas Chinese will transfer to small steamships to disembark at the Customs Wharf. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Management Association</p>
<p>Election of Chairman and Standing Directors</p>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held a new board meeting at the Bank Club at 12:00 PM yesterday to elect the chairman and standing directors. The results of the ballot were as follows: Minister Kong Yongzhi was re-elected as chairman, and Mr. Liu Hongsheng, Mr. Guo Bingwen, Mr. Hu Shuhua, and Mr. Lu Feibaihong were elected as standing directors. Other association affairs were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Li Zuchao Discusses Ideas for Developing Fisheries</p>
<p>Li Zuchao, Chief of the Fisheries Section of the Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry for the Jiangzhe Region, said yesterday that the scope of fisheries can be broadly divided into three categories: fishing, aquaculture, and manufacturing. For improvement, experimentation is essential. For experimentation, investigation comes first. It is the duty of this bureau to dispatch specialists to the coastal islands of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Shanghai urban area for separate investigations. However, those involved in fisheries are generally suspicious and secretive, which is a major obstacle. The main reason is that fishermen have limited knowledge and rarely interact with government offices, leading to this situation. Therefore, promoting fisheries education is a fundamental priority. I (Mr. Li referring to himself) plan to suggest that the education authorities issue a circular to all coastal counties, either establishing fisheries primary schools in each fishing area or adding aquatic product knowledge to the curriculum of each primary school. At the same time, the fisheries administrative organs should provide guidance from the sidelines. This coordinated approach will achieve twice the results with half the effort. As for short-term measures, we are actively planning to establish manufacturing plants, conduct aquaculture trials, purchase fishing vessels and gear, explore new fishing grounds, and promote new technologies. This bureau has selected a section of the Gongtu outside Wangongtang in Zhenhai County, Zhejiang, to prepare for shellfish cultivation trials. We will soon submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to allocate funds for phased implementation. However, funding is the mother of all undertakings, and even more so for groundbreaking initiatives. Whether we can achieve our goals depends entirely on the funding allocated by the Ministry. Furthermore, there is something I must say: Chinese fishermen generally lack a long-term vision. When a new fishing ground is discovered or a new technology is invented, they often keep it secret. Even worse, unscrupulous fish merchants are willing to act as accomplices, trading foreign fish. The lack of unity among fishermen and fish merchants has led to a decline in the fisheries market. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of. The key to recovery lies in collective effort, open cooperation between government and the people. The future of fisheries may then have hope for development. However, public awareness through promotion and advocacy is what we hope the media will provide with full support.</p>
<p>British Public Buses Almost Fully Recovered</p>
<p>Striking Workers Re-Petition</p>
<p>After the British public bus workers went on strike again, the company refused to reinstate them and the authorities rejected their demands. The striking workers are in a state of unemployment. The Route 3 and Route 6 public buses resumed service the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the workers went to the Social Affairs Bureau again to petition. However, the company, based on a board resolution, refused to reinstate the striking workers and negotiate conditions, and instead hired new workers to restore traffic on all routes. Later, because Route 3 from Zhoujiaqiao to Caonongdu and Route 6 from Tilanqiao to Gongyuan Bazichang are located in remote areas, it was feared that accidents might occur, so service was temporarily suspended. Recently, seeing that the striking workers have taken no action, service was restored from the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Update on Western Food Industry Strike</p>
<p>The Western food industry's treatment conditions have been fully negotiated through repeated mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, which jointly convened a labor-management conciliation committee. A total of seven articles have been agreed upon. The original plan was to officially sign the agreement at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. Wu Shenxiang and Zhao Jinghua of the Western Food Industry Union attended on time. Lin Zhenchuan and Wu Furen of the Western Food Industry Association were absent. Chairman Qiu Peihao, a committee member, instructed the labor representatives to sign first. Yesterday, Wu Furen and Lin Zhenchuan of the Western Food Industry Association submitted a request to resign as representatives, claiming that they were preventing the striking workers from surrounding them. They refused to sign the treatment conditions that had been verbally negotiated. As for the striking workers, they expressed their determination not to be rehired. It is said that the lives of the striking workers are truly precarious. They will be declared unemployed due to the strike, and a small number of workers have been forced by livelihood to publish notices to withdraw from the union.</p>
<p>Mail Via Siberia Delivered as Usual</p>
<p>The local Postal Service received a telegram from Harbin the day before yesterday stating that the mail via Siberia, which was due to arrive on Friday, was delayed by one day. It was further delayed near Changchun until yesterday afternoon because the Erdaogou Station is currently occupied by Japanese soldiers. After the traffic resumed, it is now running as usual. Currently, the local Post Office is still receiving and dispatching mail via Siberia as usual. However, mail to Shanghai is delayed by one day due to the Japanese soldiers occupying Erdaogou Station. A telegram was sent to the Tianjin Post Office to inquire about the train service between Tianjin and Shenyang, but no reply has been received. However, the Postal Service currently believes that mail will continue to pass through as usual.</p>
<p>Death of District Chief of County's Third District; Appointment of Replacement</p>
<p>Sun Shiben Appointed as Acting Chief</p>
<p>Yang Fulin (pen name Zhuoqun), the District Chief of the Third District of Beiqiao in the county, suddenly passed away from illness the day before yesterday. The district's assistant, Dong Nanchang, reported this to the county government and requested that a replacement be appointed quickly. After receiving the report, County Chief Yan expressed his deep sorrow for the untimely death of the district chief. In addition to instructing Assistant Dong to offer condolences to the family on his behalf, he immediately appointed Sun Shiben (formerly the District Chief of the Sixth District of Maqiao) yesterday to act as the replacement and take over the duties.</p>
<p>Emergency Hospital for Epidemic Diseases Extends Treatment Period</p>
<p>Extended to October 15th</p>
<p>After the flood, the cholera epidemic spread rapidly. Some of the epidemic hospitals and the epidemic departments attached to other hospitals have already closed, but the epidemic has been increasing recently, causing overcrowding in the hospitals that have not closed. The Emergency Hospital for Epidemic Diseases on North Xizang Road usually closes at the end of September each year. However, a letter was received from the Bureau of Health stating that the cholera epidemic this year is more severe than in previous years, and it may not be completely eliminated until mid-October. Patients with the disease must have a corresponding treatment facility. It has recently been learned that some of the epidemic hospitals and the epidemic departments attached to other hospitals in the city have already closed or are about to close, which means that later patients will have no place to be treated. Please ensure that your hospital adheres to its original purpose and extends the treatment period to October 15th. Do not stop treating cholera patients before the epidemic is completely eliminated. This matter concerns public health and requires your cooperation. After receiving the letter, the hospital immediately convened an emergency medical meeting. Considering the severity of the current epidemic and the large number of disaster victims, if there is no corresponding treatment facility, not only will poor patients have nowhere to be treated, but the epidemic will also spread, which is a major concern. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to follow the instructions in the letter from the Bureau of Health and extend the treatment of cholera patients to October 15th to benefit the patients. All expenses exceeding the budget will be actively raised by the directors.</p>
<p>Police Arrest Six Kidnappers</p>
<p>Rescued Six Kidnapped Children</p>
<p>At approximately 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, detectives He Xiaozhi, Zhang Shipin, and Wang Youshan of the Hongkou Police Department learned that kidnappers were hiding at No. 305 Kunming Road. They secretly went to the address with foreign detective Sauer and arrested Chen Zhang, a woman from Anhui. They found a kidnapped child named Akang (7 years old), who lived at a certain address in Yuanyuli, Yangshupu, and another child named Xu Baohe (10 years old) from Nanjing. Under interrogation, they learned that there were accomplices at No. 545 of the same road. The detectives went there and arrested Wang Huanan and Wang Lichun from Anhui, Chen Xianren (also known as Chen Zhang's husband), and Yang Wanchun from Henan. They also found a kidnapped boy named Wang Xinlin (9 years old) from Nanjing and a boy from Zhenjiang named Shi Xiaoxizi (14 years old). They then went to No. 543 Meizhou Road and arrested another accomplice, Zhao Duan, a woman from Anhui. In this operation, a total of six kidnappers were arrested and four children were rescued. All were taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, the case involved family members of the children who were in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and some were local but could not be found. Therefore, none of them were present in court today, and a postponement was requested. Detective He and others then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. According to the child Shi Xiaoxizi, he was from Zhenjiang and lived in Shuimahe near the city in his hometown. His mother washed clothes to make a living. He went out to collect scraps every day. Five or six days ago, he was lured to Nanjing Railway Station by the defendant Wang Huanan and came to Shanghai with the defendants Wang Lichun and Yang Wanchun. According to the child Wang Xinlin, he was from Nanjing but did not know where he lived. He had no father but had a mother and uncle who had gone back to their hometown. The child spoke fluent Shanghai dialect but knew nothing else. According to the child Akang, he lived in Yuanyu, Shanghai, but did not know the address. He had both parents, his father's name was Afa, and he was previously with Chen Zhang through Uncle Jia. He knew nothing else. After Judge Xiao Xiehuan questioned the defendants, their answers were evasive. He ordered them to be detained separately for further interrogation at a later date. The four children, including Shi Xiaoxizi, were temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Society for care.</p>
<p>Indian Beats Poor Girl to Death by Drowning</p>
<p>See How to Seek Justice</p>
<p>Xu Xiaomei, a ten-year-old girl from Shandong, recently had difficulty making a living due to poverty. Therefore, her father, Xu Jinzhong, taught her to play with a small knife, using a small sickle used by farmers to cut rice. She would throw it up and down on three sides and carry a small drum or gong to beg for money from shops and residents along the streets of Shanghai to supplement the family income. At around 10:00 AM on the 19th of this month, Xu was again playing with a knife and begging for money from the public at the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in Hongkou. An Indian watchman named Kataxing came forward to beat her away. Xu tried to escape to the riverbank. The Indian continued to chase her relentlessly, causing Xu to have nowhere to escape and being forced to the riverbank. She tried to jump onto a sampan boat parked there, but the sampan was a little far from the shore. The girl was weak and lost her footing, falling into the river. Passersby Cai Jinshan and Wang Yushan saw this and immediately reported it to the River Patrol Police. Efforts to rescue her were unsuccessful. It was not until the day before yesterday that the body was recovered. The Huishan Police took the body to the Fei Lun Road autopsy center. Yesterday, Inspector Guo of the First District Court of the Special Court arrived at the center to examine the body. He then presided over a public hearing. Xu Jinzhong, the girl's father, filed a case requesting justice. The Indian, Kataxing, stated that because the Dalai ship was about to set sail, he saw many people disembarking from sampans on the floating bridge, so he drove the girl away. Witnesses Cai Jinshan and Wang Yushan testified one after another that they saw the Indian beating Xu and chasing her. The judge ruled that it was proven that the girl was chased by the Indian and fell into the river and drowned. The body was handed over to Xu Jinzhong for coffining and temporary burial, pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Increased Shipments from Domestic Goods Factories</p>
<p>Since the Japanese soldiers committed atrocities in the eastern provinces, continuously occupying key areas, killing our soldiers and civilians, and plundering our property, everyone in the country is indignant. They all believe that boycotting Japanese goods is the only good strategy at the moment. Therefore, all well-known domestic goods have seen a significant increase in sales. For example, the Chang'e brand toothpaste, tooth powder, hair tonic, and hair cream produced by the Yonghe Industrial Company in Shanghai, as well as the domestically produced ink, soap, etc., and various rubber products from the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, such as the Dax brand overshoes, sports shoes, and men's and women's casual shoes, have all seen a significant increase in sales. Other domestic products are also selling well.</p>
<p>Victory Animated Advertising Machine on Display</p>
<p>The Victory Advertising Company at No. 1 Xizang Road, Edward Road in Shanghai has been preparing for several months. The new and unique animated motor imported from the United States was installed the day before yesterday. The light is eye-catching, and the speed of changing each advertisement is extremely suitable. During the test screenings, passersby stopped to watch, causing traffic jams. They all praised it as a first in Shanghai. It is reported that the company is scheduled to officially begin screenings on the 25th of this month. In addition, each advertisement will be interspersed with recent important telegrams and news about the Japanese invasion and occupation of the eastern provinces, in order to awaken the people's awareness. Therefore, the effectiveness of advertising is greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>Southern Weighing Machine Factory's Business Develops</p>
<p>The Southern Weighing Machine Factory was established by well-known Cantonese businessmen such as Mr. Li. It is located at the western end of North Sichuan Road and Tiantong Road. It specializes in manufacturing various types of weighing machines, which are sturdy, durable, and can be used for many years. The weighing machines range from 100 jin to several thousand jin. Although it has only recently opened, orders from customers both locally and abroad are quite crowded. Local retailers such as Dachangxin Hardware Store on Daxin Street, Dasheng on Zhejiang Road, Dachangxing on Xihuaide Road, and Ruichang on Sanma Road are all distributors.</p>
<p>Weather Report</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the coastal areas here were cloudy with showers and easterly winds. The weather around Shandong was partly sunny. There was a severe cyclone in the southern part of the East China Sea, due to a hurricane in the northern part of the Taiwan Strait moving northwest-north. There were variable and gentle winds in the Yellow Sea. Also, the highest temperature in Shanghai within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 78.8 degrees, and the lowest was 70.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 75.2 degrees, and the lowest was 56.3 degrees.</p>

<p>Youth Garden: School Opens - Xi</p>
<p>The rustling autumn wind brings coolness. In the blink of an eye, it is the beginning of the school year again. Students are all happily carrying their books to school, preparing for the work of attending classes. The schools, which have been temporarily quiet for more than two months, have suddenly become bustling markets again. Their hearts are filled with a kind of joyful color, as if these youthful lives have no sorrow. Even if there have been attacks and wounds, they have been healed at this moment. Their hearts are only thinking about how they will spend this living salt of life's consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes, they will not know what worry is. The word "worry" will never impress them.</p>
<p>Today, according to the school's notices, school has opened. So I got up very early to be on time for school. But when I got there, I couldn't help but doubt my eyes. Why were there so few people? Later, I asked a janitor and learned that today was only the opening ceremony, and there were no classes yet. Moreover, the opening ceremony had to wait until 11:00 AM. Disappointed, I casually walked to the letter rack to see if there were any letters. There happened to be one, and judging from the handwriting, I immediately knew it was from fellow student Fang. It was written simply:</p>
<p>Senior XX, I have been feeling extremely depressed lately, beyond imagination. If you have time, please come and talk to me to ease my loneliness.</p>
<p>Sincerely, XX. West Dormitory, third floor, Room 208, today. I felt that analyzing this letter, it seemed somewhat peculiar. Although it inevitably had a depressing meaning, perhaps he really had some real situation that was making him feel inexplicably down. That's what I thought at the time, so I walked to his room.</p>
<p>I pushed open the door, and fellow student Fang was still not up. A wave of odor rushed into my nostrils. I trembled and anxiously called out to him,</p>
<p>"Fellow student Fang, are you still not up? It's getting late."</p>
<p>He rubbed his sleepy eyes and looked at me with a kind of sluggish but grateful look. After a long while, he pieced together this sentence,</p>
<p>"Ah, it's really you. I just dreamed that you came. How coincidental."</p>
<p>Truly, on his thin face, his haggard expression of worry so clearly showed his depressed state. Only he lived in this room, and things were spread out in extreme disarray, as if the master of this place had not given them time to tidy up for a long time.</p>
<p>He still didn't get up, but I didn't feel that this was his arrogance. I only felt that this increased his decadence even more. At that time, because I was eager to know the reason for what was said in the letter, I didn't care that this would be a question that would hurt him when he heard it.</p>
<p>"Recently," I said, "what exactly is wrong with you?" When he heard my question, his breathing immediately became rapid.</p>
<p>"Friend," he said after a moment of silence, "this is fate. This is heaven making our family broken and destroyed. At this moment, I don't know where my parents, my brothers and sisters are wandering. Isn't this heaven destroying us?"</p>
<p>He was somewhat choked up. I couldn't figure it out for a moment, so I asked again,</p>
<p>"So, is the cause of this incident entirely attributed to heaven?"</p>
<p>"Yes, because I can't blame anyone else, I can only blame heaven. Since the summer vacation, because I wanted to attend summer school, I didn't go back. But soon I saw news in the newspaper about floods in my hometown. I couldn't help but be alarmed and quickly wrote an express letter to ask how things were at home. After about ten days, I received a reply saying that things were still okay, but after that, I never received another letter. And the news in the newspaper became more alarming every day. Alas, heaven, at this moment, I am a homeless wanderer wandering in a foreign land. What else am I hoping for?"</p>
<p>His voice was tragic and impassioned, as powerful as when he was speaking of national humiliation. It was then that I realized that my friend's hometown was in the disaster area.</p>
<p>"Friend," I said, comforting him with sympathy that I couldn't express in words, "This is indeed a fatal blow to you. However, this is still a matter of our entire nation's life. We have no power to save it. The only thing we can do now is to work hard ourselves and think about how to cultivate our knowledge and prepare to serve the country. If we become depressed again, who will the future country push onto to take care of it?"</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>Friend, we can only bear the pain for a moment. The future hope is concentrated on us. We bear so much responsibility," I couldn't help but get excited.</p>
<p>"..." But he still didn't say a word, as if he had some great hidden pain. Of course, people can't be without feelings, and in this environment, it is absolutely unavoidable. So I didn't say anything more. Only silent air circulated between us.</p>
<p>"Friend, let's bear the pain and work hard," I said, unable to bear the low pressure, and walked out in disappointment. Afterwards, I realized that this attitude was unfair to my friend.</p>
<p>The next evening, I received a letter from him delivered by the postman:</p>
<p>Senior XX, I am grateful for your comforting me this morning. In fact, you think, the situation at home has become so bad that even people with hearts of stone would have thoughts of hating the world. Moreover, I am being chased by life here and am constantly trapped in a state of helplessness, which only adds to my infinite grief and indignation. Since the aid from home has been cut off, the only way is to take money from the "son's home" (i.e., pawnshop) to use. But the things are limited, and soon they will all be pawned off. Up to now, I owe a lot to my friends, and I can't bring myself to borrow from them anymore. However, the school's opening notice is like a death warrant. I ask you, how can a penniless person have so much money? Even if the school can be lenient, I still have to pay at least some of it. And now, even the problem of eating is not settled, so everything else is just a dream. So, I thought about it a thousand times. Should I drop out of school? My stomach is empty, and in this commercialized society, what can I do? Should I continue to study? It's just a pipe dream of eating swan meat. What you advised me, how could I not know? Otherwise, I would have abandoned the world long ago. Friend, please save me. How should I dispose of my life? Yes, the faces of my classmates are all showing joyful smiles, but how much it stabs my marrow.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to read it all, and I only felt a wave of darkness in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Trying - Xi</p>
<p>Wei was forced to leave his hometown again, a young man who just turned eighteen this year. Due to the pressures of various environments, he had to embark on this dirty road to work hard. How sad this is.</p>
<p>About a month ago, he came to Shanghai to look for work. He happened to meet several of his friends from his hometown who were gathering in Shanghai to discuss how to run a newspaper back home. So they pushed him to take charge. After considering the results, because this career was very suitable for him, he agreed without hesitation. In less than five days, he abandoned his original wandering plan and returned to his hometown of low pressure.</p>
<p>After that, I didn't receive any news from him. Friends who cared about him all asked me, thinking that only I knew clearly. Little did they know that I was still trying my best to find out.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>This was a clear morning when I was still in my dream. I suddenly heard a voice calling me. I quickly rubbed my sleepy eyes and recognized that it was Wei. At that time, I was very surprised how he could have the leisure to come to Shanghai. His face looked very pale, full of the haggard look of wind and dust. My heart was filled with indescribable sympathy. Alas, our society has actually trapped a lively young man under its violent authority.</p>
<p>"I have already broken up with them," he began to tell his story. "They are not human. I can't stand it no matter what." His tone was fierce with indignation.</p>
<p>"What?" I thought he had another conflict with his family. "Maybe you are..."</p>
<p>"The newspaper can't be run," he said, adding as if he didn't hear my question. And at this point I understood, "They want to use me as their puppet, to do that career with color, and put all the blame and responsibility on me. How can I cooperate with that?"</p>
<p>Indeed, Wei is a young man with strong principles. Although trapped in a depressed and poor situation, he would never be tempted by some small gains. His heart is pure and innocent. This deception was something he never expected. With his experience, he would not have expected his friends to be setting a trap for him.</p>
<p>"I was extremely angry after all," he continued, "When I discovered this background, I immediately broke away. They also repeatedly invited people to intercede, but I honestly refused. I felt that it was better to go outside. Even if I wander and live by selling my brainpower, it is much better than suffering that."</p>
<p>"So, you want to decide to do this? But you have to know that this unstable life may not give you a good place of production. Don't expect too much from this." I said in the tone that I had always used to persuade him. In fact, everyone understands that the suffering of this kind of labor is truly unspeakable. He only relies on his ideals to construct his pursuit. So I continued, "This is a dangerous road. It is difficult to try."</p>
<p>"But I am now in a position where I have to try. Other than this, what can give me work? My family really makes me feel suffocated, so I can't care about the problems after this. I resolutely came out. This time, I even brought my luggage..."</p>
<p>"Your spirit is commendable, but..."</p>
<p>A solemn silence occupied the defense line between you and me.</p>
<p>Finally, he said, "I want to rent a small room to live in and then talk about it. I have decided to develop my energy in literature."</p>
<p>"Okay, you try it on this journey. I will do my best to help you."</p>

<p>Social News: Slump in Tin and Rubber Markets (Continued) - Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>The slump in tin and rubber markets and the wave of unemployment are not limited to Singapore and Penang, but are widespread in the Netherlands, England, Siam, France, America, and other places.</p>
<p>(III) Relief for the Slump in Tin and Rubber Markets</p>
<p>(A) For Capitalists: The main points are to restrict production and reduce inventory.</p>
<p>(I) Methods of Relief for Rubber</p>
<p>Rubber relief must be through the British Malaya government and the Dutch East Indies government to discuss the restrictions policy. The method can emulate the London Malaya Rubber industry, the board of directors of each company and other such organizations agree by telegram to order the companies to implement a reduction in cutting, in order to reduce production. The method of calculating the index of reduction is as follows:</p>
<p>Mariembi-Bikois Company Limited, 30% reduction</p>
<p>United Eastern Plantation Company, 30% reduction</p>
<p>Johore Central Rubber Estates, 30% reduction</p>
<p>Krajong Rubber Planting Company, 30% reduction</p>
<p>Malacca Alor Gajah Rubber Estates, 25% reduction</p>
<p>Federated Malay States Rubber Company, 35% reduction</p>
<p>(II) Methods of Relief for Tin</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlote, an official of the Federated Malay States Mines Department, invented the Rawlote New Policy. His proposal is to reduce current inventories so that the current low price of tin can be extended to a normal level. After the invention of this Rawlote New Policy, it was immediately proposed and discussed by British tin industrialists and Malayan tin industrialists for a considerable period, lasting several months. The result was that many judgments stated that if this new policy were put into practice, it would definitely achieve the purpose of relieving the tin industry. The conditions of this new policy are detailed below:</p>
<p>1.  At least 30% of the world's tin producers, and 40% of tin producers from the Federated Malay States, Bolivia, Siam, and Nigeria, etc., guarantee that they will no longer mine tin, no matter what, in order for the price of tin to reach a turnaround price (200 pounds).</p>
<p>2.  Those who agree with and are willing to implement this new policy should sell a portion of the unmined tin to large organized companies. The price will be based on the market price, plus 50% of the difference between the market price and the turnaround price, to the point where it can only maintain the current state of the tin mine.</p>
<p>3.  The tin will be transacted, or the tin payment will be cleared, only after the turnaround price is reached.</p>
<p>4.  Tin producers, etc., should organize a large company with sufficient capital of 1.5 million gold pounds to enable this policy to be realized.</p>
<p>The above four items are the conditions of the Rawlote New Policy. Fearing that there are still unclear points, a specific example is given below:</p>
<p>For example, a certain tin mine produces 1,000 piculs of tin per month. According to the current market price, it is calculated at 40 yuan per picul, which is 40,000 yuan. If the maintenance cost is 8,000 yuan, and the turnaround price is 200 pounds, that is, 60 yuan per picul. The tin produced is now sold to the newly organized large company at 40 yuan per picul (market price), plus 50% of the difference between the market price and the turnaround price (i.e., 60 yuan minus 40 yuan, which is 20 yuan, this is the difference, and then 50% of that is 10 yuan), giving 50 yuan per picul. If Tin Mine A sells 160 piculs per month, calculated at 50 yuan per picul, it can get 8,000 yuan, which is enough for expenses. And this tin mine's 1,000 piculs will not be mined for the time being until the turnaround price (200 pounds, i.e., 60 yuan per picul) is realized.</p>
<p>Tin mining companies have seen this. According to a Reuters London dispatch on December 26, 1930, "The Chairman of the Tin Producers' Association issued a notice to members outlining the international agreement plan for the balance of tin production. This agreement is currently under final consideration by the governments of the countries concerned. If they all agree, it can be implemented. The clauses are as follows: (1) The international quota must be calculated from January 1, 1931. All tin or tin ingots exported after the end of December must be counted in the quota for the first quarter of 1931. (2) This agreement should remain valid for the year. (3) The quota can be changed at any time according to the situation, because the purpose of this agreement is to adjust supply and demand and</p>

<p>— Young Yi</p>
<p>When Prussia was ravaged by Napoleon I, the national spirit was boosted. Women all took off their gold jewelry and exchanged it for iron because iron could strengthen the country. Germany has the saying "Iron is gold."</p>
<p>As a result of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, France was defeated. The treaties under the siege were: (1) to cede the two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine; (2) to pay an indemnity of 5,000 million. This huge sum of 5,000 million was paid off by France in a few days because all the common people took out everything they had. Therefore, the German Prime Minister Bismarck sighed and said, "France will always be our big problem." An Italian poor and sick child was on a ship. A foreigner saw his pity and gave him some money. He was very grateful, but when the foreigner and another person talked about the failure of the Italian country, the child took out the money given to him and went to the foreigner. "I don't want money from people who scold my country."</p>
<p>Before the Russo-Japanese War, a Russian on a street in Japan saw a Japanese child and gave him some sweets to eat. As soon as the child saw that it was a Russian, he refused to accept his things, saying, "You are Russian, you can't have your food."</p>
<p>During the Russian Empire, the Crown Prince of Russia once toured Lake Biwa in Japan. Seeing the beautiful scenery, he proudly said, "When will my palace be built here?" His sycophantic subordinates said, "It's right in front of you." A Japanese police chief accompanying the Russian prince, after hearing this, took out the hand from his waist and shot at the Russian prince, but missed.</p>

<p>A Special Mail: The most special and strange mail in the world was recently delivered to London by the post office. This mail was a very large package, a living package. This package was Belgian journalist G. Lantcheere. He paid the postage in the Brussels Post Office and sent it to a certain place in London as a sample of something worthless. At that time, the post office attached a label and stamped it with a postmark. It was sent directly to London in the aircraft's parcel compartment. When the plane landed in Croydon, the staff of the British Post Office checked and delivered it. He came all the way, and there was not much difference from other passengers, but he was in the parcel compartment and had no chair to sit on, because a parcel certainly does not need a chair. In terms of cost, the fare for an ordinary passenger to fly from Brussels to London by plane is four pounds, while the postage for this living package is only two pounds and eight pence. However, when he returns to Belgium, he can no longer use this method, because the British Post Office does not accept such living packages sent abroad. If it is within the territory of the United Kingdom, then whether it is sent as a parcel or as an express letter, it can be handled.</p>

<p>Land is a world, and the sea is also a world. Sea creatures, the most ferocious and giant ones, such as whales, seals, manatees, sea tigers, and sea elephants, etc. We can see them in aquariums or on the screen. According to Spanish scientist Limbrech Clock, the sea is immeasurably deep, and there are probably tens of millions of species of creatures. However, sunlight only reaches 600 feet below the surface of the water, and no human has ever dived to 6,000 feet or more. The creatures seen in aquariums and on the screen are only one-tenth or one-twelfth of the total. The creatures below 6,000 feet are strange and indescribable, and all the creatures have no eyes, because sunlight does not reach them, and the eyes are eliminated and lose their effectiveness. Although this comes from Limbrech Clock's speculation, the principle may be true.</p>
<p>The big bananas in Siam are about a foot long and unusually large. Eating one can make people full, so getting two or three bananas a day is enough to eat and be happy, drumming their bellies and enjoying themselves. It is not more than the people of Huxley.</p>
<p>The Eagle Yang is also called the Mexican Yang, which is the national currency of Mexico. On the obverse of the coin is an eagle with a snake in its beak. What is the purpose of this? Few people know it. Some say that in the past, the Mexican revolution failed. A certain revolutionary leader fled to a barren valley. One day, he saw a small eagle fighting a giant snake. The eagle exhausted all its strength and killed the snake and pecked it to pieces. The revolutionary leader was greatly inspired, fed his horses, sharpened his weapons, and reorganized his troops. In one fell swoop, the revolution was completed. Once the foundation was laid, coins were cast to depict eagles and snakes, so as not to forget their encouraging contribution. I don't know if the statement is credible.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Research on Planting American Wheat <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Zhiben</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Yangnian's research on American wheat varieties published in "Free Talk" on September 20, I couldn't help but feel terrified. This year's rice has failed to produce any grains, and we must rely on foreign food for maintenance. If we plant miscellaneous grains with little certainty after the disaster, we will still have to beg for foreign food next spring. Therefore, the miscellaneous grains planted this winter must be ones that are fully certain and can be harvested. Do not rashly try to plant American wheat and treat people's lives as a game. Therefore, Dr. Love solemnly declared: Misplanting American wheat will be unimaginable. Now I will describe it one by one on the left.</p>
<p>(1) American wheat includes all the remaining wheat in the United States. Due to different climates, different soils, and different amounts of rainfall, some grow in the southern United States and are not suitable for the north, and some grow in the north and may not be suitable for the east. This is the case in its own country, let alone transplanted to our country.</p>
<p>(2) American wheat includes a large number of varieties. Some varieties are suitable for a certain place in our country, while others are not suitable for a certain place. It is not easy to know whether they are suitable or not until after trial planting. According to Mr. Chen, the American wheat he has planted in the past ten years has achieved very good results. I am afraid that the American wheat Mr. Chen planted is suitable for the soil and climate of Jiangzhou, Zhenjiang. But I don't know what the scientific name of the American wheat Mr. Chen planted is. Can you tell me? It can also be an aid to the experiment.</p>
<p>(3) I also sent Jinling University No. 26 improved wheat to my home in Ninghai, Zhejiang, for trial planting. The results were equal to zero. It may be due to unsuitable soil, climate, or rainfall, resulting in short and unfruitful stems. According to the research, No. 26 wheat is a native wheat near Nanjing, not a foreign product. It is not suitable for its own country, let alone American wheat.</p>
<p>(4) The government and local authorities set up agricultural experiment fields to introduce good varieties from other countries and improve the original varieties of our country. After testing them and confirming their effectiveness, they then advise farmers to plant them.</p>

<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>In the early years of Jiaqing, Japan had an engraving of "A Collection of Famous Landscape Pictures of Tang Dynasty". This book has been widely circulated recently. It is all works of tracing and imitating by those who traveled to the capital and returned to their country at that time. The order of its volumes is: first the Inner Court, then the Imperial City, then the Inner City, then the Outer City, then the surrounding gardens and suburbs, and finally the various prefectures of Zhili. Its compilation starts with a general map and then goes on to the norms, cultural relics, scenery and famous places, followed by explanations, and references to inscriptions by famous people. For the Inner Court, there are pictures of emperors and empresses wearing winter and summer court clothes, pictures of morning visits at the Meridian Gate, pictures of the nine gates inside the Meridian Gate, pictures of the grand court meeting at the Hall of Supreme Harmony, pictures of banquets for foreign Mongolian vassals at the Hall of Preserving Harmony on New Year's Eve, and pictures of small banquets at the Palace of Chonghua. For the Imperial City, there are pictures of proclamations being issued at Tiananmen Square, pictures of peony and peony flowers being offered on the Lantern Festival, pictures of ice games, pictures of martial arts examination for Jinshi at the Ziguang Pavilion, and pictures of the emperor plowing the fields and the empress raising silkworms. All of these are the prosperity of fame and cultural relics in the era of peace, which cannot be fully seen even in books such as "Collection of Statutes". As for the pictures of the East and West Peace Gates, the pictures of the four memorial archways, and the pictures of the Zhengyang Gate and Zhengyang Bridge, they are the traces of the city streets in the capital, which can be used to verify the ancient from the present and are like matching talismans. As for the various government offices, temples, altars, gardens and imperial residences, either their names remain, or their locations have been obliterated. Looking at their paintings, they all appear as if they can be seen. The efforts of construction and creation over hundreds of years can still exist in our imagination for a long time. This is indeed a rare treasure of illustrated books that has not been seen in China. As for the system of figures and clothing, most of them are far from the current situation. Those who love the ancient are especially indispensable to take a look. I think that the most interesting thing about the changes in customs from ancient to modern times is the offering building and the brothel. The pictures of the East and West Qinglou recorded are in the area east of today's Dengshikou. The prostitutes are all dressed in long robes and heavy makeup, playing the zither and pipa to entertain the wine. The embroidered curtains and red candles are far from what can be seen in today's world. The stage of the Zha Building outside Zhengyang Gate is not different from the current system. However, all the spectators are standing in the open. Women began to live in mat sheds. In the old-fashioned theaters before the Republic of China, the seats were all arranged in long benches, and if you listened with your ears, you would not face the stage directly. Women lived upstairs. If men and women sat together, it would be greatly criticized by the current public opinion, and the police station would strictly prohibit it. Therefore, it is known that it is a relic of the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Now, there are only a few of these theaters left. Men and women sit together, and no one dares not to obey. The painting base of the "Collection of Famous Landscape Pictures of Tang Dynasty" is very thought-provoking. The words "Guanghe Zha Building" are written on the memorial archway. The Zha Building was created by a wealthy merchant surnamed Zha. Therefore, all theaters are named after Zha. I don't know when it was mistakenly called "Tea". Only by obtaining this book can we correct the misunderstanding of the people of the capital that has been passed down for generations.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen's statement, if a person obtains excellent results in trying a crop in one place, he thinks it is okay. Then why does the government spend huge amounts of money to run agricultural experiment fields?</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Chen said, "The earlier American wheat is planted, the better." I don't know that early is enough to kill it. Wheat has a dormancy period to protect it from the cold. It starts to germinate and grow after the spring warms up. If it germinates too early, it will easily be frozen to death. American farmers put cattle and horses into wheat fields in winter or use stone rollers to press it to prevent it from growing too vigorously. This is why.</p>
<p>I think that at this critical moment of life and death, there should be no remarks to show off. "I don't know what the doctor based his claim on." If the limelight comes out, the ignorant will echo it, and then tens of millions of lives will be in danger. (Moved to help with disaster relief)</p>

<p>— Zheng Yanfan</p>
<p>The theory of astrology has been around for a long time. Because I think it is close to superstition and occasionally a coincidence, I have never dared to believe it. Thinking about it now, I realize that the reason why it has been passed down for so long and has not declined is because there is a reason for it.</p>
<p>The evening before yesterday, I accepted an invitation from a relative and friend to a banquet at his house. Before the banquet was half over, a servant hurriedly brought a telegram, saying that my father was seriously ill. My elder brother sent a telegram to urge me to return home. The whole table was shocked. I immediately planned to return home and set off overnight. My friend said, "It's too late. Why don't you wait until tomorrow? Fortunately, Mr. Liang is here, you can consult him. He should be able to tell you whether it's a bad omen or a good omen." Although I didn't believe my friend's words, I was in a state of confusion and could no longer control myself. The gentleman looked at me for a long time and asked my age. My friend told him one by one. After a while, the gentleman smiled and said to me, "Your father's illness is not mild. It starts with chills and fever, and then diarrhea. But a lucky person will be blessed by God. He will be able to turn danger into safety. Good news will arrive in no more than three days. You don't have to go. It's just a waste of time to go back and forth." I listened to his words and thought that Mr. Liang saw people's misfortune and deliberately made comforting words to relieve it. Moreover, my old father is nearly seventy years old and his body is weak. If he is not seriously ill, he will never send an urgent telegram to urge me to return home. I still didn't believe it. Before the banquet was over, I said goodbye and went home. So I prepared everything and bought a ticket to return south. When I arrived home, my father's illness was indeed cured and he ate as usual. Suddenly I met Mr. Liang and asked him about the illness in surprise. My father told him about it and said, "I sent you a fast mail yesterday to ask you not to come back." At this point, I had to believe what I had never dared to believe before. Mr. Liang is thousands of miles away from my hometown. How could he know the beginning of the illness? How could he know the condition of the illness? He was able to know that the illness was not a problem. And he said, "There will be good news in no more than three days." Indeed, everything was as he said. The mystery in this is unknowable. The gentleman's name is Zuo Shu, and his other name is Zhen Zuo Bi. He was born lame and had a right wrist. He only relies on his left hand to write. He is a strange person in Guangdong. He used to set up a writing desk in Central, Hong Kong, and was famous for a while. He is now living at 162 North Sichuan Road. I will go to thank him when I have the chance. (Decline the reward)</p>

<p>"This can't be considered a debate. Maybe there are fewer people in your family, and there are fewer troubles that occur in the family, at least you have fewer things to worry about than I do. Auntie there, I have to subsidize her twenty yuan every month. She has no children. It's really hard. An old aunt, although she lives in her nephew's house, her nephew's situation is not good either, and I subsidize her ten yuan every month. My wife is younger than you, but we got married earlier and have had this big bunch of children. The education expenses every year have accounted for 30% of my income. I have also sent the two youngest to nursery schools. I really can't bear it. These two children have mothers, but no one pays attention to their clothing, food, and shelter. They are only controlled by servants, so I don't want them to live at home. You think my monthly expenses are not very large, right? But my wife is still not satisfied with the money I provide her. She is always complaining about being poor every day. One minute she has no money to pick up the custom-made leather shoes, the next minute she is clamoring that she has no money to pay for the vegetable bill for entertaining guests, and the next minute she is planning how to pay for the club membership fee. The purchase of other decorations and the consumption of going to movies and dance halls really make me exhausted and difficult to supply, so I feel that the deterioration of the relationship between husband and wife is mostly caused by money. What do you say?" Mr. Chen was half complaining and half trying to tell Mrs. Li about his financial situation, hoping that she could suggest some ways to manage his finances.</p>
<p>"How is the money for your household expenses distributed to your wife every month?" Mrs. Li was ready to contribute some advice.</p>
<p>"It would be great if you could tell me how to save money. I know my own faults, which is that I don't have an accurate budget, so I have accumulated a large deficit: but in good conscience, I use very little money myself."</p>
<p>"You should stipulate an amount, accurately give your wife the amount for household expenses and the amount to supply her, and agree with her that she is not allowed to exceed it, or it may make your finances a little less."</p>
<p>"Alas! If I did that, she would definitely transfer the household expenses to other uses and spend it all on herself: as a result, there would be no household expenses, and I would have to find a way to pay for it a second time."</p>
<p>"Then from now on, you will manage all the household expenses yourself, and you will only give her a personal monthly allowance. Don't give her too much. Isn't that also a standard?"</p>
<p>"I'm busy enough with work outside during the day, and I still have to manage the household. Why do I need a wife?"</p>

<p>Afternoon Initially Flat, Then Wild Fall Before Closing: The Afternoon Market Opened at 701 Taels, Followed By 08 Taels. The Market Situation Was Still Firm. Before Long, The Downward Trend Started Again. Because News Spread That The Japanese-Russian Situation Was Urgent, Major Players Were Selling Off One After Another, Such As Yuanmao Yong Dada Cheng Tong Taichang, Etc. Also, The Indian Exchange Rate Rises Again By One Rupee, So It Plunged Sharply. At 3:00, It Was 697 Taels. Hengxing Neixing, Etc. Were Buying, and In A Moment It Increased to 703 Taels.
