<p>自由談一得之言  秋水　　怨恨。是弱者對付强敵的唯一武器。　　「不服從」是美德之一。因爲這與「勿關」很難區别。「勿關」是世界上最普遍而又是惰性最重的一種惡德。　　不爲人所愛護者。無礙於其事業之進展。然而不爲人所尊重者。必致萬事無成。　　友朋間而有欺瞞之事。即非良把全把全友。　　只要你能賺錢。就爲社會聞人。國家要角。　　假使有一個偉人的心腸。完全揭示於人。那末他立刻將被他人剌死。　　摩登男女的戀愛。好像是嚼橡皮糖。初嚼時滋味雋永。如魚就水。嚼久了。就覺淡而無味。必須吐了出來。另換一條。　　學生們非到畢業之後。不知失業之苦。所以要根本救濟失業。最好是把全世界的學校封閉。　　做慈善事業者。頗與好色的登徒子相類。表面上痛惡惡德之滋長。而實際上却自巳在培植惡德。　　事無大小。其成也均須有相當的條件。故世界上决無絶對的自由之事。誌伊通河  王午　　現在萬寳山事件。閙得天翻地覆。韓人的暴行。日益擴大。牽涉到旅韓的華僑。平壤仁川的華人。爲韓人暴行所襲擊。死傷至數千之多。損失逾億萬之外。真是一件出乎意料的不幸。所有本事的詳情。各報均有記載了。今之所述。祇是伊通河游記的一段。　　光緒廿九年七月。我奉了郵傳部令。前往滿蒙一帶。安設電竿。所用電竿計八十萬株。均由伊通河運往。分置河干一帶。伊通河本有兩支。一爲伊通綫。計長九百九十八里。可以行舟。載用貨物。夏秋水漲。可通汽船。一爲公主嶺綫。計長三百五十二里。水漲可以用筏載物。經過地點如馬哨家。河東汪再西即萬寳山。萬寳山在當時尚係荒地。未曾開放。然巳有韓人在彼偷種。萬寳山屬長春府管轄。山不甚高。只一土邱耳。若果開放河渠。輸入伊通河之水。便成膏腴之地。時任長春府知府。爲鄞人章魯泉。彼以鄉人之故。曾准浙人王尚三開鑿溝渠。種地十萬响。三年之間。獲糧食三十萬石。不意王爲紅鬍子所殺。其地遂廢。這是我經過長春章魯泉告訴我的話。言下有不勝惋惜之意。但是我舟過福田時要將十萬株電竿。運置河干。及往招夫。竟有山東人應命而來。我在搬運電竿之隙。竟向萬寳山一帶去調查。只見隴畝東西。人家櫛比。聽其言語。十人之中。齊魯之音十分之七。其三乃韓人。國巳滅矣。無家可歸。受雇於人。只求得食。惟余筆記之中。但知有張家堡王家堡。不知其爲萬寳山也。　　當時余幾疑桃花源記之非寓言。而此輩韓人。皆國破家亡。痛涙傷肝。如王尚三之開鑿耕種。召集韓人。衣之食之。故能得其死力。王尚三斃於鬍匪。其所耕之地。爲齊魯人所有。齊魯人奴使韓人。久巳積怨。日人又好行小惠。貸以貲金。使之安於耕種。以養其家人。故余之運木於伊通河。事在三十年前。日人力戰經營。剛剛獲得南滿鐵路之建築權。出全力以赴之。不像中國官府大而化之。對於人民從來是不相聞問的。即如長春府章魯泉對我說。「自王尚三死。萬寳山之墾地皆荒。」其實山東人盜墾。不經官府的批准。早巳伏了今日械鬥之根。　　郝永德租蕭翰林的荒地。組織稻田公司。要不放伊通河的水。又何能種稻。韓人轉租郝永德的公司。更是私相授受。本來河水灌輸。是兩方相利的。韓人持强。日人助之。這就是山東人的不服。有這次大械鬥了。呵韓兒  賀天健　　近日報載日人驅韓民阻斷我伊通河流侵奪我萬寳山田。更唆韓民焚殺我僑胞。憤而作此。　　東海有長鯨。睒睒閃巨睛。　彼滔天浪。時來與我爭。神州爲我土。赤縣爲我城。適天各有分。何以强兼并。三韓原我族。荳萁本同生神器忽淪没。夷爲甌脫氓。愴彼生何辜。魚肉任作羹。黑奴久解放。彼何仍犧牲。悲痛吾未巳。螟蛉一朝成。蚩蚩作先驅。爲他人作兵。伊通阻我水。萬寳輟我耕。仍未饜詎慾。驅衆爲飛　　。漢城演焚殺。慣技嗜劓黥。魯土濺蔡血。寒暑才數更。而今燄復熾。十萬資焚坑。揚言爲呵護。虎倀相倚行。哀哀我僑胞。赤手無抗衡。廬旣被其火。門外羣兇迎。出入不免死。撼天發號聲。一時爲驅散。骨肉不相營。此際何堪思。生命如毛輕。萬里辭故國。異域害孤惸。彼何敢爲此。邦交敦夙盟。今廼適其反。無異投棘荆。誰邦無外僑。誰國無客卿。舉世皆如此。日月何以明。寄語朝鮮兒。何忍殺汝兄。惜隂書齋清譚錄  柯定盦　　余得摯友馬孟容君介紹。識江都夏宜滋君。昨午往訪。君正從事印泥工作。雙手殷紅。亟拂拭而出。速余入内。頓覺古色古香。令人生羡。君研究印泥。迄巳二十餘年。其原料中之最名貴者。一曰硃砂。係得自滇貴。所謂大劈砂者是也。大如龍眼。就燈光視之。晶瑩如寳石。一曰藕絲。乃自藕中抽得之。加以精製。方能合用。湖藕百斤。抽絲祗一錢。其名貴可見。印泥之用藕絲。乃君研究之心得。爲前人所無。神品印泥始用之。因成本至昻故也。一曰伏油。須經十數寒暑之日曝夜露。君所用者。巳珍藏十有五年矣。一曰野絨。係採自川省人跡罕至之深山峻嶺間。質柔而韌。再事煉製。凡此種種。均爲巿上所未備。他如珊瑚瑪瑙珍珠……等。必須精研。寛猛並濟。始克有成。蓋過急則如砂。過緩則不裂。君謂是項工作。非親自爲之不可。嘗有一男工云。余願拉車終日。而不願細研半刻。未及來復。竟自逸去。亦一笑談也。君又曰。余鑒於書畫家作扇頭書畫。所蓋鈐記。非經珠粉之舖灑。即易模糊。與精妙之佳作。不能相稱。殊覺可惜。特發明印泥一種。能於蓋後即乾。拭之不去。擬邀請書畫界友人一試云云。又承以佳茗見餉。厥茶係自獅子峰最高處摘得。取其嫩者。與水仙花同製。水則來自惠泉與虎跑。裝以未經盛酒之紹興酒罎。託友轉運。君嗜茶若此。可與陸羽盧仝嫓美。君與余對坐。中置小几。上設茶具。先傾水於大茶杯内。取茶葉入壺中。迨水之温度適合時。徐徐注之壺内。稍待。執壺摇之君嘗其味。似尚未可。再片刻。各傾一杯。甫入口。清芬沁脾。君曰。飲茶雖小事。亦有至道存乎其間。非獨解渴巳也。水候待其恰好。茶味俟醇和。則甘芳雋鑒。其味靡長。凡飲四次。君曰。其味盡矣。尚有梅花荷花……等製之品。凡三十餘種。容日次第共君品之。余曰。齒頰留芬之句。大可用之今日。君爲軒渠不置。　　藝術界消息　書畫金石名家陶壽伯君。兹鑒於索書或索繪扇面者日衆。爰定一潤例。書畫雙面。共收潤一元。外埠另加郵費一角。石章每字半元。五日取件。備有樣張。函索附郵五分。寄二馬路上海報館。　　誌謝　中華圖畫雜誌第四期。由胡伯洲君編輯。北四川路蓬路口新中華圖書公司發行。全部用影寫版印刷。加以彩色畫片數種。異常精美。其他圖畫文字。亦饒有趣味。允爲圖畫雜誌中難得之佳構。昨承惠承一册。又復旦大學攝影學會新出年鑑。印刷與材料。並皆佳妙。該公司爲之經售。攝影家不可不備。承惠贈一册。并此誌謝。游韓漫談（五）  寄萍　　朝鮮新聞事業。以漢城爲中心。漢城的報紙。分日文·韓文兩種。日文爲京城日報·朝鮮新聞·朝鮮日日新聞。第一種是總督府的機關報。第二種是日本民政黨的黨報。第三種是商辦的。這三家報。都是代表日本人講話。操縱全韓的輿論。是文化侵略的生力軍。其次韓文報有朝鮮日報·東亞日報·每日申報·京城工商新聞·朝鮮經濟日報。這幾家雖係韓國文字。而内部重要份子及其背景。却還是日本人。專以供給中年以上不懂日文的韓人看的。此次萬寳山事件發生後。那幾種報便巧施其技。出號外·發特刋。虚造吾國官民欺侮韓僑。鼓動韓人起排華風潮。韓人大都見短識淺。一被煽惑。信以爲真。忍不住了便紛起排華的暴動。漢城騷然。各地響應。結果鬧得滿城風雨。我們不要忘掉那班辦報人的功德。這件大慘案。到昨天我們才得着一個差强人意的消息。是漢城全韓民衆團體聯合大會。給吾全體國民的電文。内云「貴國旅韓僑民。横遭蹂躪。至深歉仄。凡此情形。殊非出自韓人本懷所有。……」這才是韓人自巳覺悟受人愚弄的鐵證。　　朝鮮人組織的政黨。有新幹會（按幹字本爲韓字丶因不得日當局許可丶而改作幹字丶）天道敎·侍天敎·青年同盟會·少年軍全鮮聯合會·婦女組織的有模花會。這些是比較正式的革命黨。然而「黨」字犯忌的。只能稱作「會」或是「敎」其中範圍最大的。首推新幹會與天道敎。他們的同志。各佔全鮮人民三分之一。但是組織很散漫。勢力不能擴張。意志也就難於集中。因爲處處受日本的監督與束縛。隨在不能自由。譬如開會。先要報告總督府。有時准。有時就不准。即使准你開會。當局或派密探旁聽。或派武警監視。形勢非常嚴密。除非你是預備坐監獄。受處分。才可以發表一些言論。否則休想談什麽革命。到還是在海外的韓僑和留學生。他們對於革命工作。很熱心。很努力。然而鞭長莫及。國内難於策應。又不能回國去號召。所以韓人談革命。乃極困難的事情。記得三年前有一位韓國革命青年的領袖李箕煥君。也不能在本國立足。來到中國。進黄埔軍校研究軍事學。曾參加北伐。後又担任閩南泉屬民團的敎官。一天晚上。在厦門被日領署便衣警越權拘捕。解回朝鮮嚴辦。當時厦巿民衆。因日警侵犯吾主權。引起一度反日運動。至今李氏還禁錮獄中。解脫無期。日本人兇狠的手段。可見一斑。說部扶輪會？？？（二二）  徐卓呆　　這麽一澆水，把叉麻雀的火澆滅了。韵玉和月如，便在子良旁邊，大談特談，子良呆呆聽着。伊們先談跑狗塲的停閉，再談百貨商店夏季大减價，又談到太保阿書，再談新出的花邊，又談京滬車的脫車，忽而談上海女子新裝束，忽而談到鎮江去吃新鮮　魚，忽而又談及猶太富翁哈同之死，忽而談今年枇杷的價錢。子良聽聽，實在幾乎笑出來，伊們的談話，都没有一定，真是雜亂無章；不過子良總不開口，坐在旁邊，動都不動，講了好一會，葉女士忽然一看錶上：　　「時候不早，我要去了。」　　「你往那裏去？」　　「我到我母親那邊去。方才從車站上下來，直達此地，母親一定盼望着了。」　　伊立起來了。　　「那末你此番到上海，有幾天躭擱？」　　「大約可以玩一個月。我住在母親那邊，你有工夫，也可以過去玩玩，今天我要去了，說不定明天就會再來！」　　葉女士要走，子良不得不立起來送送，一送，只好與夫人一仝送下去，娘姨替葉韵玉呌好了車子，然後伊們倆在弄堂内一陣笑聲，車子去了。　　子良曉得葉女士此番光降到亭子間中，消耗我的光隂最長久，上半天曾有躭擱，都没有這麽長久。子良心裏一急，便不與夫人說什麽，趕往樓上去了，似乎覺得夫人並没有回進來，聽聲音，好像到隔壁人家去了。</p>

<h3 id="c39">不列顛最近汽車事業概况 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>世界百業衰落。汽車製造業亦受影響。倫敦報紙某通信員近就英國之汽車事業。作一概論如次。依照事實而言。汽車製造商常以其新出之模型。陳列於十月中之汽車展覽會。故欲討論最近之汽車事業。自不得不從十月爲始也。一九三零年十月至一九三一年三月。此半年中汽車之新註册數爲七四·一八四輛。與去年同時之七六·五五爲輛相比較。跌去百分之三·一。二月二十八日止全數捐照之汽車計八三九·二六二輛。較之一年前之八零四·五六四輛。增加百分之四·三。至於汽油之消耗。是否每輛汽車較商業衰落前爲减。因無顯著之證明。不能具論。但就近來小汽車製造猛進。及大汽車用油之省儉而論。各汽車之平均行程。當傾向於增多方面。似可斷言也。汽車出口業。少有不振之象。一九三零年十月至一九三一年四月。不列顛私用汽車之出口者。計共一二丶六○○輛。前一年爲一八丶○三七輛。兩兩相較跌落百分之二○丶二。愛爾蘭及南非洲之巿塲均保持前狀。澳洲營業則一落千丈。出口汽車之價格。年中巳由一八零鎊跌至一五九鎊。同時進口方面亦從九丶七○四輛跌至三丶七一○輛。四月份中平均進口汽車之價格爲一百八十二鎊。較之去年之一百七十三鎊。略有增進矣。</p>
<p>英國以外之各國。雖同時無正確之數日可資比較。然就大體而論。不列顛之地位較海外競爭各國實大佔優勢也。不列顛造製家之出品。其供給國内巿塲之需。佔有百分之九十四。一年之前。則爲百份之八十七。易言之英製造家之出品。其於國内巿場。現約减少二丶三○○輛。外商出口者减少五千輛之譜。而實際上則不列顛實業。增進其銷售二千五百輛也。不列顛全部銷售之汽車（以本國註册者减去進口數而加入出口數計之）自十月至三月計共八一丶九一二輛。較之前年之八四丶二五五輛實有减色。但此項捐失常應進口數之减少而相擠於平也。照目下之情勢而論。尚稱不惡。蓋不列顛之汽車出口以澳洲爲最大巿塲。尤以車架之輸出爲甚。故今日之澳洲經濟困難。予不列顛以影響者非無因也。苟澳洲一旦能排除其所過之障礙。不列顛汽車事業自能獲得相當之利益。印度政治之轉機亦然。下列之表記載英國私用汽車之新註册數。其中包括倫敦·本州·威爾士·蘇格蘭·北六州及英倫别地而言。商業衰落所影響於汽車註册。爲數有限。堪以注意者也。</p>
<p>一九三○年十月至　一九二九年十月至　一九二九年十月至　跌落百分</p>
<p>一九三一年三月　　一九三○年三月　　之</p>
<p>倫敦及本州　　　　　　　二六·五七七輛　　二七·八○四輛　四·四</p>
<p>威爾士·蘇格蘭及北六州　二二·○一七輛　　二二·四三五輛　一·九</p>
<p>英倫别地　　　　　　　　二五·五九○輛　　二六·三一一輛　二·七</p>
<p>總計　　　　　　　　　　七四·一八四輛　　七六·五五○輛　三·一</p>
<p>如將目下註册各汽車之馬力種類。加以考查。得知汽車製造家前途頗爲光明。其於公衆所啫者亦經調換其口味。此地所引爲不幸者。即大不列顛亦如少數國家。對於汽車牌號註册統計。向不公佈。八匹馬力之「孩兒車」仍居先進地位。自十月至三月新註册之汽車爲二零·一三九輛。前一年則爲一九·二七輛。此項數目足證目下之新車登記中。其百分之二十七乃係八馬小車。而巿上通行之汽車中百分之十七爲此項小汽車也。汽車製造家對於小汽車之製造。前進不遺餘力。如澳司汀·馬力斯·脫冷夫·星格及司會夫脫等是著名廠家之多造模型其趨勢不無退化之象。一年前五家著名之製造廠共出二十三種模型。迄至今日出至二十八種。因此各廠家之傾向减價。可無必需之困難。其初因福特將於達勒哈地方設一新廠。以備在不列顛巿塲中常年産車五○·○○○輛。各廠家咸汲汲以爲减價之舉不可或免也。十匹馬力之汽車如羅浮·司坦達·司會夫脫等。甚爲卓著暢銷。本年之新註册數爲八·一六七輛。一年前則爲四·七四三輛。曾經風行一時之十二匹馬力汽車。現巳失去地位。今年新註册數祗九·九○○輛。去年爲一三·○○四輛·相差頗鉅·</p>
<p>其尤堪稱異者。自新福特車盛行後。十五匹馬力汽車如馬立斯·亞姆司脫朗雷笛萊等。銷路較遜。停滯不前。新註册數爲九·一八九輛。一年前則爲九·五零四輛。若最後之三個月更有不景氣象。十六匹馬力之汽車如澳司汀·克洛司來·亭白·星格等亦未見佳。新註册數八·八一六輛。十六年則爲九·一九七輛。十六匹馬力以上之汽車所受之打擊尤巨。良以公衆絀於經濟。此種情勢决不可免。新註册數爲一○·二五八輛。較前跌去百分之十三·四。雖然。大車之前途尚有曙光可言。目下縱有衰落之象。尚可保其無虞。不致續有進境。至需要方面雖不若前之盛。然亦頗爲堅俏也。大車註册之數較進口之美國汽車爲多。足徵其前途尚有若干希望。故綜上而言。今年之汽車事業。其衰落之象實較他項實業爲淺。但明年因有福特車加入售價之爭戰。前途如何不敢斷言矣。</p>
<h3 id="c40">最近汽車工程之又一進步 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>利用高壓原理　增加行車速率</p>
<p>汽車一物。時至今日。其製造方面。迭見改良。大有日新月異之概。而在各種改良之點以外。最近又有一大進步。即利用高接之壓縮。以增加速率。經濟汽油。夫汽車界之欲利用高壓原理也。爲時巳久。惟種種障礙。不勝其多。一時不克實現。垂三十年之久。經汽車界之苦心研究。在最近數年之中。始得將各種障礙破除。而所謂高壓之引擎亦得與我人相見。實爲汽車工程上之一大進步。以今日之汽車而言。游歷車亦用高壓之引擎。壓力之高度。設與一九二六年之汽車相較。則巳超過不少。而所謂競賽車者。則完全利用高壓。其壓力又超過游歷車多多。以最近情形。證諸他日。則在最近期内。競賽車之製造方法。或將另成一格。與游歷車完全不同。蓋不如是則引擎不足適應其競賽之環境也。</p>
<p>汽車之得以發動。乃恃於汽油之力量。而汽油之所以能産生力量。則係受汽油所發蒸氣。在著火之前。一種壓力之作用。今日巿上所有之游歷車。平均每輛汽油蒸氣所受之壓力。五倍於昔日。至於競賽汽車。則當十倍或十一倍於昔日矣。職是之故。競賽汽車。每加倫汽油。可得多量之動力。而此種力量。　可增進行車之　率。至於游歷汽車。因高度之壓縮而所得額外之力量。則不僅速率得以增進。他如推動之增進。汽油之經濟。均有重大之影響也。惟我人如欲將所得額外力量。依法分配於各部。利用無餘。則爲一極難之事。以今日汽車界之趨勢而言。汽油之經濟。殆爲最大之問題。是故壓力之加高。僅在節省汽油。而不在增進行車速力。蓋濟。殆爲最大之問題。是故壓力之加高。僅在節省汽油。而不在增進行車速力。蓋不力之減少。推動之便如。速率之增進。震居直接間接。均可經濟汽油也。</p>
<p>上文所謂汽車之製造。如利用高壓原理。則可節省汽油。此事巳由勞斯安極立斯製造競賽車之專家米勒氏證明。據其所言。則一盛油箱之汽油。可增至路程一百三十哩。而此種盛油箱。言其容量。可盛汽油八加倫。且祇須將引擎之頭部。輕輕移動。即可增加壓力。而另一方面。亦可使燃燒室之範圍縮小。運用之便利。實爲昔日所不及。此外更有一重大之證明。即用高壓之汽車。與普通之車。裝載重量相同之貨物。行駛於同一道路之上。相距一百五十哩。行駛結果。八加倫汽油。每加倫均可增進四哩餘之行程。</p>
<p>此外更的汽車廠一家。亦用一法。以證明高壓之功效。當時用六缸汽車一輛。壓縮率由四减至一。故汽油蒸氣之壓力。較之原時。僅及四分之一。則每加倫汽油。可行二十哩。而每小時之速率。則爲二十六哩。旣而增加壓縮之高度。達六倍於初時。其他各部丶皆未見有若何影響。而行車之速率。則大爲增進。每加倫汽油。可行三十四哩·根據上述種種。可知壓縮之加高。旣可增進速力。又可節省汽油。誠一得而兩便之事也。</p>

<p>每四人得汽車一輛　據美國汽車駕駛人會之調查。現在美國人民每四·六人得佔汽車一輛。此項統計依據人口調查得之數目計算。其人口總數在一九三零年始爲一二·七七五·○四六人。全國之汽車數。合四十八州及哥倫比亞區計。總註册數爲二六·五二三·七七九輛。此數係包括客車及運貨車等而言。各州之中又以加利福尼亞爲魁首。其比率爲每二·七人得車一輛。阿拉巴瑪殿軍。九·五人得車一輛。紐約居中。五·四人得車一輛。各州比率如次。阿拉巴瑪九·五。亞利桑那三·九。阿甘色斯八·四。加利福尼亞二·七。科羅拉多三·三。康湼狄格四·八。德拉瓦四·二。哥侖比亞區三·七。佛羅里達四·四。佐治亞八·五。愛達和三。七。伊里諾斯四·六。印第阿那三·六。衣阿華三·一。甘薩斯三·一。干塔啓七·八。路易斯安那七·五。缅因四·二。馬里蘭五·○。馬薩諸塞五·米西根三·六。明尼蘇達三·四。米西西背八丶四。米蘇里四·七。蒙大拿布拉斯加三·二。内華達三·○。紐罕什爾四·六。紐裘賽四·六。紐墨西哥五·○。紐約五·四。北卡洛立那六·九。北大各塔五·七。哇海涯三·七。哇克拉花麥四·五。俄勒岡三·七。本雪文民亞五·四。羅得島五·○。南卡洛立那七·九。南大各塔三·三。田約西七·一。得克薩斯四·二。猶太四·四。浮蒙四·一。維基尼亞六·四。華盛頓三·五。西維基尼亞六·四。威司康生三·七。俄明三·六。</p>
<p>福特車廠游行各城　福濟汽車製造廠最近攝製有聲電影一部。詳述福特汽車製造之程序。裝配之方法及各種製造工程。來往美國各城鎮鄉村開映。以供未往福特車廠參觀者得有造車之概念。此片因係聲片。故開映之時無異置身車廠之中。舉凡鎔鐵鑄鋼。鋸木機製等各項工程。可以一覽無遺。旣多興趣。復有敎育之價值者也。福特汽車每日可産數千輛。其製造上之唯一緊要工程。即係正確無誤。庶裝配時吻合不差。此片對於零件之製配。極爲詳盡。雖毫釐之微亦不相差。片中　　　　　之副産品。亦指示無遺。此種聲片游行。籌備於數月之前。及經試騐。成效大著。故巳分攝多片。往小城鎮開映。此外又陳列各種汽車用具。以輔影片之不足。</p>
<p>璧克汽車經久耐用　據璧克車廠之調查。璧克汽車之陳奮年高者。巿上通用爲數仍屬不鮮。老車中之製造時期有遠至一九四零年者。其經久耐用。可覘一斑。璧克當局曾就北美各縣之汽車註册加以調查。發現璧克之舊車不少。其在巿上通用之璧克車中。七三·二七一輛巳用過十年或十年以上。二千五百輛巳用過十五年或十五年之上。其巳用過二十年者約有一百十五輛。璧克因銷路甚暢。今年開始。八時巿上統計約一百五十萬輛之多。以全美人口一二二丶○○○丶○○○計。則每八十一人中必有一人駕用璧克。若以人數及家屬計。則每二十家庭中必有一家用璧克云。</p>
<p>今年二百萬輛汽車　依照近來美國汽車銷售數言。一九三一年之汽車出産及銷售數。前途尚爲樂觀。且能有高而新之紀錄。至各汽車公司之獲利。亦自意中之最高耳。春季之汽車銷數常爲一年中之最高峯時期。據調查所得。四月份中全美汽車銷數丶並無低落之象。執此而言。夏季之汽車需要。當亦不致大相懸殊。且今年春夏之交。改有若是之殷需。全年銷數殆甚可觀。故統計家之計算。今年新車抵舊至少需二百五十萬輛。惟退一步言。即能銷至二百萬輛者。亦頗滿意矣。目下福特及雪佛蘭汽車之出産運銷。較之四月份大有增加。據福特方面估計。五月份遇車當</p>
<p>逾一二五丶○○○輛。雪佛蘭之數至少須一一○丶○○○輛。威係六缸者云。</p>
<p>汽車往坎拿大旅行　每届夏季。美國人駕汽車往坎拿大旅行者。數以千萬計。今夏估計旅行人數當不下五·五○獲·○○○人。凡兹旅行家均將經過國際境界而入坎士。旅行人大半來自加秋福尼亞及北部諸州。據加州汽車會旅行部所接得之消息。合衆國及坎拿大之關員。在華盛頓勃蘭痕城邊境者。自六月一日起。晝夜工作。二十四小時中並不休息。凡由美往坎之汽車旅行家。必須將各州之汽車註册證呈騐。方能通過邊境。否則恐有留難之虞。坎人對於美旅行之離駐其土在九十日内者。豁免一切護照費關稅等等。去年美國汽車之入坎拿大者。共五·四○九·四五八輛。其中四·一一○·一○○輛在坎境停留未滿二十四小時。一九三零年汽車入坎境者較往年增多九○○·六四九輛。</p>

<h3 id="c42">鄂東汽車路通車後情形 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 學遷</p>
<p>鄂省興築汽車路爲時巳久。惟實行通車。頗爲不易。一因需工甚大。二因經費又鉅。三因里數甚長。故雖分鄂北鄂南鄂西鄂東四區分别進行。而成效未能悉如計劃。最近鄂東汽車路之通車者。雖僅數月。而行旅商賈。無不感其便利也。但以通車之舉。實屬創始。故其設備。自難周密。則將來之逐步改良。有望於關心路政當局諸公矣。現以鄂東汽車路通車後之情形言之。是路自通車以來。因車道横貫黄陂·黄岡·麻城等縣數百里路程。數小時即可到達。而票價又不甚貴。較之在未通車前。由漢口至麻城須三日方至。旅費則須十元以上。而行路之艱難。尤非一言可盡。故通車之後。乘客頗爲擁擠。由漢口至麻城縣城。約長二百餘華里。票價四元餘。上午六時許由漢口三元里購票上車。經過礄口横店黄陂縣及黄岡之李家集。麻城之宋埠岐亭中館驛而達麻城縣城。沿途大小十餘站。大站停車。小站間或不停。視車上乘客之多寡。臨時酌定。此行車時之情形也。至其車别。有貨車·客車·長票·短票之别。每日約開十餘輛。聞鄂東汽車路局共有貨車客車二十餘輛。當通行之初。貨物甚少。乘客較多。故貨車不大需用而客車則頗不敷用。路局遂將車臨時安放長凳。作爲客車之用。以應臨時旅客而利商賈。查貨車之形式。與漢口巿之貨車同。客車形式。與漢口巿公共汽車同。不過略小而整潔。車上兩面横列五凳。每凳可坐二人丶每車可客二十人。車頂有鐵欄。以便乘客安放隨時所帶行李雜物。車站售票。每車原祗限售客票二十張。但用乘客甚多。往往於限滿後。仍勉强購票上車。故每輛客車常有載客至二十五六人者。因是車極形侷促。此雖乘客所自取。然售票者果能於每車限滿之後。决不徇情再售。當可維持每車二十人之秩序。不過初通車時常有軍人不肯購票强行登車之事發生。並且中途攔登者。亦日有所見。前經建設廳函請駐在路線之第十三師夏斗寅部隨時巡邏保護。以安行旅。又訂定正式軍人服裝符號齊全半價乘車優待之例以後。此等事遂不常見此車别及售票之情形也。總之是路係前初建。且又泥底。故每值雨後。泥深没踝。車不能行。天雨後即不能通車。即雨後初睛。而行駛汽車。往往將路碾成數寸深之輪溝。睛後泥即乾結。一時又不易回復平坦之狀。故行車顛跛頭自爲暈。猶之上海閘北公共汽車之行駛江灣者。每遇天雨。情形正與鄂車路同。現由建廳力加改良。正設計興工。擬將漢口至麻城一段路面。先行加舖煤燈。應使天雨之轉。水龍滲漏。不致妨碍行車。此路面之情形也。又聞近因大舉剿匪期間。是路爲防制土匪。冒爲乘客。混入車中。别有企圖起見。故對於檢查乘客。亦極注意。除購票登車時。加以查檢外。沿途駐軍。亦隨時在各站檢查。建廳處派有武負在黄陂以上施行檢查。因檢查周密之故。通車以來。尚無何等重大事故發生。比之其他汽車道較爲安全。至其查票。亦極認真。苟非正式</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>軍人乘車。即令購得優待之半價票。倘到目的地車站被查出時。亦必須補票。此其檢查與補票之情形也。大抵是路在目前所急應改良者。則宜添購客車。以便利行旅是也。蓋是路以客車不夠。往往臨時以貨車替代。其載客多則四十餘人。少亦三十餘人。雖貨車較客車稍大。但路面不平。其顛跛之苦。尤甚於客車。未免含有多少危險耳。</p>

<p>— 敷</p>
<p>頃據上海通用汽車廠總理馬爾斯君所接報告。本年四月份。通用汽車於美洲及加拿大兩處之銷數。計佔汽車總額百分之六十二。若合一二三四月份計之。則佔全額百分之五十。按去年四月份。通用車銷數。佔百分之三十二。去年一二三四月之銷數。約佔百分之三十五。兩相比較。進步顯然。且在極短期間。有此美滿成績。難能可貴。彌堪驚羡。至其所以有此驚人成績。泰半當歸功於雪佛蘭出品之精進。綜計雪佛蘭公司之全部職工。刻巳逾三萬六千人。而所設諸廠。且有自一九二九年秋季起。即巳特别加工趕製者。他如璧克。華克蘭。及寳塔克諸車。其産量亦皆有增無巳。華克蘭與寳塔克之本年四月份銷數。較之前一月份。激增百分之四十。蓋係一九二九年八月份以來之最高紀錄也。</p>
<p>通用廠各種車輛之海外銷數。且莫不有顯著之進步。綜計其四月份之出口數量。不特超過前月份。較之去年同月。亦且倍增焉。尤足稱者。日本猶吐庫電車公司。於東京及猶吐庫間。向以電車儎客。今則廢除軌道與電車。而以雪佛蘭公共汽車代之。於此足徵雪佛蘭出品之堅優卓絶。與其銷數之所以蒸蒸日上矣。</p>

<p>— 范</p>
<p>公路局改名管理局　增加車輛分期實行　進行計劃暫時停止</p>
<p>浙省之築路通車。爲全國先進。自於民十一年設立省道局後。即致力規劃建造公路之事宜。迨民十六年。國民政府首都南京。各省設立建設廳。浙省建設廳。鑒於公路之重要。於十七年四月。改組省道局爲公路局。擴大組織。積極進行。並擬具全省路網大計劃。及五年建設計劃。分年實行。先興築幹線。預算本年度增加車輛一百四十九輛。建造紹温線全線路面。錢塘江公路橋梁。及甌江靈江橋梁二座。通車里數增至一千三百公里。所少經費二百六十三萬餘元。由省庫支出。築造公路之計劃。至今日巳有相當之成績矣。</p>
<p>自省　府改組後·張　先主席鑒於浙省政費浩大。所入不敷開支。乃編制新預算。實行緊縮政策。將巳辦有成效之衛生建築事業。先後合併停辦。公路局受此影響。巳屢次攺縮。但仍以財政窘竭。難於維持。故經省府委員會第四百次會議議决。將公路局改公路管理局。專司養路事宜。車輛則分期增加。所有計劃。及進行中各路。一律暫行停止。俟省庫餘裕。再行辦理云。</p>
<p>浙省原定路線爲一萬餘里。今巳築成者祗五分之一。今以緊縮政策而改組。此後公路之發展。恐不能如巳往之猛進矣。</p>

Shangguan Yunxiang and Jiang Cai's divisions are now only twenty miles from Donggu, and only several dozen miles from Ningdu. They will definitely be recovered soon. (4) Jiang telegraphed the generals of all routes, stating that the key to attacking is the elimination of the main force of the Red bandits, not the recovery of cities and territories. Each unit should maintain flexible communication and avoid falling for the Red bandits' tricks.

<p>On Insulting Others and Self-Insult (II)</p>
<p>Only self-insult invites insult. Having discussed this yesterday, I would like to discuss it further. If one is insulted by others for no reason, the blame and shame lie with the insulter. If a butcher is suddenly attacked by a robber who binds his hands and feet and empties his pockets, the butcher certainly suffers, but it is not the butcher's shame. The violent criminal who robs for gain and defies righteousness is truly shameful and truly an enemy of mankind. If there is any justice in the world, the occurrence of such violence is a shame to all mankind. The actions that defy public reason and justice are seen by all, and cannot escape the final judgment of public reason and justice. Therefore, after the Wanbaoshan Incident, the Japanese forced the Koreans to boycott the Chinese, and massacres of Chinese occurred in various parts of Korea. Our people have already understood the hidden motives, and the clear-eyed Koreans have repeatedly revealed their conspiracy and expressed their apologies to us. When the thugs attacked the Chinese street in Incheon with great momentum and extreme danger, the British consul came forward to uphold justice. The Japanese cruelty and wickedness were further revealed to the world, and it is even more evident that behavior that defies public reason is abandoned by all mankind. Pointed at by thousands, one dies without disease. The previous Germany is an example. We only need to look at the crab with disdain, seeing how long it can move sideways. Suffering persecution is not a cause for much worry. Only self-insult cultivates it gradually, accumulates it subtly. Accumulation makes it irreversible. Self-insult without realizing it eventually develops into an irreparable crisis. Being self-important and self-enclosed is self-insult. Comfort and ease, extravagance and indulgence are self-insult. The rampant spread of bandits and the frequent occurrence of famines are self-insult. Having our own minerals but not being able to develop them, having our own land but not being able to cultivate it, is self-insult. The initiative of being insulted lies with others, the initiative of self-insult lies with ourselves. Being insulted is obvious, self-insult gradually becomes imperceptible. Its shame is a hundred times, a thousand times greater than being insulted. This is truly the national and ethnic humiliation of our country. In the past hundred years, the people of our country have been singing and dancing merrily in this national and ethnic humiliation, feeling content and not blushing at the mockery of other countries. Once foreign insult arrives, they cry out to public reason and justice and declare to other countries: "This is our shame!" Few are spared from being ridiculed, and nothing could be more worthy of tears than this. Although being insulted and self-insult are both insults, being conquered and self-destruction are both destruction, but foreign insult can still be avenged, while self-insult cannot be avenged. Foreign conquest can still be saved, while self-destruction cannot be saved. Therefore, when faced with the influx of foreign insults, the people of our country should resist foreign insults with a united spirit, and even more so, they should no longer engage in self-insult with a united spirit. Otherwise, we truly have nothing to say about the vast future. The arrival of foreign insults is not limited to the current situation.</p>

<p>The countryside is covered in disaster victims. The Huangnitang dike collapsed on the evening of the third day, causing hundreds of houses to collapse nearby. Furthermore, yesterday, groups from the Sanshui disaster area wired for relief, claiming that the dikes in various villages and areas under Sanshui's jurisdiction, including Daliang, Yancong, Dalang, Shiban, Gaofeng, Baimu, Rongse, Tiedun, Changzhou, Yongning, Duntou, Zaogang, Mian, Shangxia Mei, Cang, Qingtang, Ruifeng, Chagang, Baishi Bao, and Pingdeng Wei, had successively collapsed. Fields and gardens were completely submerged. Tens of thousands of disaster victims are living in the open on hills, a scene of misery unseen in decades. The West River's current is swift, causing rapid torrents to surge directly towards Foshan. Consequently, the dikes near the Guangsan Railway, such as Shaobian, Xiebian, Luoge, Zhewei, Yongan, and Shangyuan, are all on the verge of collapse. Floodwater has submerged the dike tops and entered, resulting in over sixty submerged areas in Foshan's inner streets and one hundred and three submerged areas outside the city. Floodwater reached Shaobian Station by the afternoon of the fourth. On the morning of the fifth, Guangsan passenger trains suddenly announced a suspension of service because the water at Chatou Station was over a foot deep and had damaged several sleepers. After the railway bureau dispatched workers for urgent repairs, passenger and freight trains resumed normal operations in the afternoon. As for the various counties in the Dong River area, those flooded by the eastern floods from Heyuan City to the Guanyinge area have turned into a swamp, a vast expanse of water with no green grass. Inside and outside Huiyang City, places like Guankou, Tangxia, Jiangpu, Toutou, and Shaibu Changxiushui Lake are about three feet deep, and residents are using boats as transportation. The water north of Boluo City's north gate is four feet deep, and the water outside the southwest gate is over three feet deep. Additionally, it's said that the water level in the upper reaches of the Han River continues to rise, resulting in countless people and livestock drowning. (July 7th)</p>
<p>A Quick Letter from Wuhu: Wuhu has experienced more than ten days of heavy rain, with mountain floods and river tides surging continuously. Drainage ditches between streets and markets are overflowing, obstructing transportation. Rural embankments and dikes have been under constant repair.

Several other smaller dikes have also been damaged.

<p>Sports Hong Kong China-Portugal South Tour Competition Schedule Finalized: Thirteen matches from August 1st to August 30th. A performance in Hong Kong against the Hong Kong Army on the 12th. Divided into two teams to compete, with ticket proceeds to benefit the Confucius Academy. The entire team is scheduled to sail on the Zhibade Wheel on the 21st. (Hong Kong Letter, July 9) As morality declines and people's hearts are not as ancient as they used to be, those with lofty ideals feel anxious. Therefore, there are three or so enthusiastic individuals who advocate teaching the world with the doctrines of Confucius. Recently, the Kong Sheng Xuehui purchased Shengdao No. 131 as the academy's site, but the finances are still insufficient. As the China Association South Tour team's journey is imminent and the fierce generals of East China are gathering there, the people of Hong Kong deeply desire to admire each person's ball skills. They have earnestly requested the China Sports Association and the Hong Kong Army Joint Team to hold a match, with all ticket proceeds to be used for the Confucius Academy's expenses. This has been agreed to by the China Association and the Army Joint Team and is scheduled to be held this Sunday at the Seven Sisters Stadium. However, the organizers, believing that the South Tour team has a wealth of talent and that a single match cannot fully showcase each player's ball skills to satisfy the audience, have divided the South Tour team into two teams (not the A and B teams), and the Army has also been divided into two teams, to be held on the same day. The first half will be at 4:00 PM, and the second half will be at 5:15 PM, and spectators can watch both matches with a single ticket. Regarding the ticket prices, there are four types: honorary tickets at 5 yuan each, covered stands at 2 yuan, and uncovered stands at 1 yuan and 50 cents. Tickets are now on sale at China Association at 58 Avenue Zhong, Zhongsheng Charity Association at Zhonghuan Road, and Confucius Academy at 11 Banham Road. This exciting football match will restore the lively scene of the Seven Sisters field on that day.</p>
<p>The schedule for the China South Tour has also been finalized. The name is tentatively set as the China-Portugal Joint South Tour Team. The reason for including the Portuguese is that the Surabaya China Football Club has been delegated to invite teams, and the teams have unanimously requested three conditions: (1) There must be a large number of coaches participating. (2) There must be Yuehua players traveling with the team. (3) The Chinese players must be members of the A team. Therefore, the team is named the China-Portugal Joint South Tour Team. The team is scheduled to sail on the Zhibade Wheel on the 21st, with an estimated arrival date of July 30 in Sibu. After arriving in Sibu, the competition will begin. The schedule has been arranged, except that Pacheng has not been able to designate a specific team.</p>
<p>Surabaya August 1st vs. Tao Er Team August 2nd vs. Yise Suo Team August 8th vs. Player Joint Team August 9th vs. China Team Pacheng August 12th Team Undecided August 15th Same as Above August 16th Same as Above August 17th Same as Above Wanlong August 22nd vs. League Leader Lunuo Team August 23rd Player Joint Team Liben August 25th vs. Friendship Association Team Longchuan August 29th vs. League Leader Mot Team August 30th vs. Player Joint Team The most regrettable aspect of this South Tour is that Li Yuda and Lin Yuying may not be able to participate due to work commitments. Li Yuda is a trainee in the navy, and Lin Yuying will be serving in Hong Kong. Despite Chen Lianbo's efforts to persuade them, it may be difficult to make it happen.</p>

<p>At approximately 7:00 AM yesterday, railway workers discovered a man lying in a pool of blood by the side of the tracks outside the Shanghai South Railway Station in Yangqi West Fence Lane. The man appeared to be in his twenties, dressed in a short blue striped cloth shirt, with a white undershirt underneath. He wore gray cloth trousers and had a flat-topped hairstyle. He had two gold teeth inlaid in his mouth and was barefoot. Barely clinging to life, it was evident that he had been assassinated, with several knife wounds, including injuries to the side of his head and left ear. The incident was reported to the Gaochang Temple Second District Police Station, and Inspector Gao dispatched officers to investigate. The injured man was transported to the Xinpu Yutang hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, it is feared he may not survive. Nearby residents reported hearing someone crying out urgently around 4:00 AM that night. However, due to the remote and desolate nature of the area, they were afraid to investigate.</p>
<p>A Man and Woman Attempt Suicide by Poison - One Dies, One Survives</p>
<p>Dong Zixiang Driven to Suicide by Poverty</p>
<p>Ma Alan Fortunate to be Rescued</p>
<p>On the night of the 11th of this month, in Room 11 of the Beizhan Hotel, located at No. 5 Jielu Road in the North Railway Station area, a guest named Dong Chenxue from Wuxi (alias Ma Shouxiang), aged 26, attempted suicide by poisoning due to economic hardship. Dong succumbed to the poison and died. Ms. Ma was barely alive and was transported to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Ms. Ma's condition improved due to the lighter dose of poison and the timely medical intervention, and she was revived by the next day. Yesterday morning, detectives from the Huishi Police Station brought Ma Alan from Guangren Hospital and escorted her to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that around 1:00 PM yesterday, the Beizhan Hotel at No. 309 North Shanxi Road reported to the Chinese constables that a man and a woman in Room 11 had attempted suicide by poison. The constables reported this to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They found the man dead and the woman barely alive. The woman was taken to Guangren Hospital. An autopsy revealed that they had ingested opium. The man's body was taken to the Féi Lun Road morgue. By 10:00 PM that night, the woman regained consciousness and identified herself as Ma Alan, 22 years old, from Wuxi. She stated that the deceased was named Ma Shouxiang, though he used the name Dong Chenxue at the hotel. She claimed they had decided to commit suicide together due to their inability to find work and extreme poverty, purchasing opium to share. They consumed the opium at midnight on the 11th, each taking a box. She ate hers first and then lost consciousness. She woke up to find Ma Shouxiang dead. She insisted that their suicide attempt was voluntary and that there was no coercion involved. Judge Ge Zhitan questioned if she was hiding some unspoken pain. Ma Alan replied that she was alone and destitute, suffering from economic hardship, and had decided to end her life after much deliberation, stating that there was nothing else to add, crying as she spoke. Judge Ge then adjourned the case until the 21st of this month and ordered the police to take Ms. Ma away. She was immediately sent to the morgue. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Guo Wei from the Special District Court arrived at the morgue to examine Ma Shouxiang's body. During his examination, a witness named Zhu Huanzhen testified that he was a friend of the deceased, whose real name was Dong Zixiang, from Wuxi. He said Dong had an elderly mother, a wife, and a three-year-old daughter at home. Zhu had not seen Dong recently and was unaware of the circumstances of his suicide. He came to claim the body after seeing the news report. After Ma Alan gave her testimony, Prosecutor Guo stated that the autopsy revealed that Dong Zixiang had died from opium poisoning. Since the police had filed charges against Ma Alan, also known as Ma Mashi, she should be handed over to the court. The body was released to Zhu Huangen, a friend, for funeral arrangements after he signed a guarantee.</p>
<p>A Laborer Dies After Jumping from a Vehicle</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 PM, near the Tilanqiao Pei Kai'er Road, a sanitation truck of the Public Works Department, numbered 16693, was traveling along the road when a laborer jumped off the vehicle. The rear wheels crushed his skull, and he died instantly. After the incident, a patrol officer arrived and transported the body to the morgue for examination.</p>
<p>Lu Youcai Struck and Killed by a Car - Investigation</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Chinese constable numbered 2304 from the Huishi Police Station was patrolling Jingzhou Road when he saw four or five children playing with slingshots made of leather straps and wire. As he approached to disperse them, a 15-year-old boy named Lu Youcai ran north on Pei Kai'er Road and crossed the street when a truck numbered 9335 sped by, hitting and killing him. The officer transported the body to the Féi Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court assigned Prosecutor Guo to examine the body. During his examination, the boy's father, Lu Baozhu, stated that he would file a lawsuit with the Special District Court for his son's tragic death. Prosecutor Guo stated that the autopsy confirmed that Lu Youcai had been killed by vehicle number 9335 and ordered the body be released to his father for funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Xu Renquan Seeks Justice for His Sister</p>
<p>Xu Renquan of Gaoyou submitted a petition to the District Court yesterday, stating that his sister, Wang Xu Mashi, 31, was married to Wang Tingchen from Yangzhou, who resided at No. 1 Jiade Lane, Xietu Road. She was subjected to abuse. On the 11th of this month, Wang severely beat his wife, and she fled to her sister's home. After being persuaded to return, word came that she had died suddenly. Having arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou three days later, he examined his sister's body and found two bruises on her waist and ribs, indicating that she had died from her injuries. When her sister inquired, Wang claimed she had died of a sudden illness. He believes the conflicting information is highly suspicious. He requests an investigation to seek justice. Chief Prosecutor Liu ordered the body to be brought to the court for examination.</p>
<p>Public Bus Accident Case</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association Requests the Public Works Department to Investigate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department regarding the case of Public Bus No. 15015 hitting a pedestrian on Di Siwei Road. It stated, "According to a letter from Huang Mao Mashi, her son, Lin Nian, was riding a bicycle on Di Siwei Road around 10:00 AM on July 4th when Public Bus No. 15015, speeding from behind, struck the bicycle, knocking him down and fracturing his leg. He lost consciousness and was taken to Tongren Hospital by the police. He is currently in critical condition. The police have not yet initiated an investigation. We respectfully request that you instruct the Public Works Department to investigate the matter according to the law and order the responsible party to provide medical expenses and support for the family." Vehicle accidents must be investigated according to the law. We hope that you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<p>Striving Against the Repeated Levying of Business Tax on Manufactured Goods</p>
<p>The Scientific Instrument Hall Sends Another Letter to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Scientific Instrument Hall sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce stating: "(The above is omitted) What our hall wants to know is whether the same capital owner should be levied twice for the business tax if the manufacturing location is separate from the sales location. What we want your association to strive for is that the same manufactured goods under the same capital owner should not be repeatedly levied due to the separation of manufacturing and sales locations. This is not that the ministry's orders are unclear. Now the Ministry of Finance has not explained the principle of levy to the whole country, but only added an explanation to the previous order, fearing that it is not enough to make people satisfied. We believe that your association is deeply versed in law and economics. We hope that you will thoroughly explore according to economic principles, or visit economic experts, or legal accounting teachers, to seek their correction. If the ministry's orders are appropriate, it should be announced to all industries and be followed. If the ministry's orders are inappropriate, it should present a request for relief to the Legislative Yuan based on academic principles, so that good taxes will not turn into harmful business. This is what we sincerely pray for. In modern times, industry is prosperous and cities are flourishing. Manufacturing is mostly in the industrial zone, and sales are in the commercial zone. The two locations cannot be separated. The manufactured goods from the manufacturing location are wholesaled to the sales location, and there is no sale behavior. The manufactured goods delivered from the manufacturing location to the sales location only notify the cost and do not add any profit. When the sales location wholesale, it is based on the cost, considering the market situation, and determining the price. For example, handling documents, the manufacturer drafts it, and the seller verifies and issues it. How can it be said that these are two things? Moreover, direct wholesale in the factory and setting up a sales office away from the manufacturing location have different procedures, but the nature is the same. It is like judicial supervision and other institutions. Because the institution's affairs are not complicated, each department is in the same institution. If the Executive Yuan is separated from each department, it cannot be said that the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the other four institutions is different. Our hall准情度理, in fact, is still confused about the re-levying of business tax on manufactured goods. Please give detailed instructions and check the handling, I am very fortunate.</p>
<p>Wu Jingtai Pays Attention to Foreign Merchants' Deeds</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Jingxiong, advisor to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, told a Guowen News Agency reporter yesterday that his report to the Public Works Department is in progress and may need to follow the example of advisor Fei Tang to solicit opinions on various municipal administration matters from various groups in this city for reference. However, Mr. Wu paid particular attention to the issue of deeds because many Chinese merchants' real estate and land are registered under foreign merchants' names. This is enough to increase the tax amount for foreigners, and Chinese merchants who pay a large amount of taxes are not actually getting the benefits. He plans to study this issue in detail and find a proper solution. However, these are all things that people are doing. As for the responsibilities borne by the Public Works Department, they are matters that the board of directors of the Public Works Department cannot solve, that is, to solicit opinions from me to find a solution.</p>

Fortunately, they missed, and they fled in different directions. Because it was late at night and dark, it was unknown where they fled.</p>
<p>Robbery Case Goes to Trial</p>

Each of them carried a knife. The police detective stated that both defendants confessed at the police station that Ah Fu invited them to wait in Changjiang Lane next to the Changjiang Cinema. Each of them carried a knife, and their confessions were written down. Liu Huicheng and Chen Chongqing, the deputy manager of the mill, were present when the confessions were written down. Judge Feng then read the confessions aloud, but both defendants denied them. Liu and Chen testified that the defendants' confessions at the police station matched the written confessions. Judge Feng then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the trial.</p>
<p>Xue Bin Repeatedly Extorted People</p>
<p>The Matter Was Exposed, and He Fled to Hankou</p>
<p>He Was Arrested Upon Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>The owner of Zhou Songhe Redwood Shop at No. 134 Huiguan Street in the South City received three letters from extortionists in December of last year, demanding 1,000 yuan. The shop owner reported the matter to the police station, and following the instructions in the letter regarding the meeting place at No. 71 Haichao Temple Road outside Xiaonanmen in the South City, the police arrested Yao Baoshan. During questioning, Yao claimed that he had been deceived by Xue Bin, the owner of Xuechang Machinery Factory at No. 128 Xiaoximen. The police went to arrest Xue, but he had already fled to Hankou. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that Dong Mingde, the leader of the first district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team, learned that Xue had returned to Shanghai and was taking a bath in a bathhouse at the Wangjia Que intersection. They rushed there and arrested Xue Bin. During questioning, he claimed to be 22 years old, from Anhui. He admitted that he, Gu Shulong, Wang Benxiang, and Zhu Xingquan, who ran the Guangyuan Printing House on Daxing Street outside Xiaoximen, had extorted Zhou Songhe, the owner of the redwood shop, last year. He said he had only returned to Shanghai in March of this year and had joined Gu and others in extorting Luo Yide, the owner of the Luo Yide Leather Shop at No. 154 Jiaozhou Road in the British Concession, and Wang Dexing, a resident at No. 44 Haige Road. In April, they also extorted Yao Deben, a resident of Xiaomaoqiao in Longhua. They had divided all the stolen money and spent it. The case was handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Free Talk - A Thought</p>
<p>Autumn Water</p>
<p>Hatred is the only weapon of the weak against the strong.</p>
<p>"Disobedience" is one of the virtues because it is difficult to distinguish from "Don't care." "Don't care" is the most common and most inert evil in the world.</p>
<p>Not being loved does not hinder the progress of one's career. However, not being respected will lead to nothing.</p>
<p>If there is deceit between friends, they are not good friends.</p>
<p>As long as you can make money, you are a social celebrity and a national leader.</p>
<p>If the heart of a great man is completely revealed to people, he will be stabbed to death immediately by others.</p>
<p>The love of modern men and women is like chewing gum. At the beginning, the taste is mellow and interesting. After chewing for a long time, it feels bland and tasteless. It must be spit out and replaced with another one.</p>
<p>Students do not know the pain of unemployment until after graduation. Therefore, to fundamentally alleviate unemployment, it is best to close all schools in the world.</p>
<p>Those who do charity work are quite similar to the lustful Dengtuzi. On the surface, they hate the growth of evil deeds, but in reality, they are cultivating evil deeds themselves.</p>
<p>No matter how big or small, its success must have corresponding conditions. Therefore, there is absolutely no absolute freedom in the world.</p>
<p>Record of Yitong River</p>
<p>Wang Wu</p>
<p>The Wanbaoshan Incident is now raging. The brutality of the Koreans is increasing day by day, involving overseas Chinese in Korea. The Chinese in Pyongyang and Incheon were attacked by Korean brutality, with thousands of deaths and injuries, and losses exceeding hundreds of millions. It is truly an unexpected misfortune. The details of all the events have been recorded in various newspapers. What is described now is just a passage from a travelogue of Yitong River.</p>
<p>In July of the 29th year of Guangxu, I was ordered by the Ministry of Posts and Communications to go to Manchuria and Mongolia to install telegraph poles. A total of 800,000 telegraph poles were used, all transported by the Yitong River and distributed along the river. The Yitong River has two branches. One is the Yitong Line, which is 998 li long and can be used for boating and carrying goods. In summer and autumn, when the water rises, steamships can pass. The other is the Gongzhuling Line, which is 352 li long. When the water rises, rafts can be used to carry goods. The places passed through include Mashaojia and Hedong Wang Zaixi, namely Wanbaoshan. Wanbaoshan was still wasteland at that time and had not been opened up. However, Koreans were already secretly planting there. Wanbaoshan is under the jurisdiction of Changchun Prefecture. The mountain is not very high, just an earthen hill. If the canals are opened up and water from the Yitong River is introduced, it will become fertile land. The then magistrate of Changchun Prefecture was Zhang Luquan from Yin. Because of his fellow countryman, he allowed Wang Shangsan from Zhejiang to dig canals and plant 100,000 mu of land. In three years, he obtained 300,000 shi of grain. Unexpectedly, Wang was killed by Red Beards, and the land was abandoned. This is what Zhang Luquan, the magistrate of Changchun, told me. His words were full of regret. But when my boat passed Futian, I wanted to transport 100,000 telegraph poles to the riverbank and recruit laborers. Shandong people came to respond. During the gap in transporting the telegraph poles, I went to investigate the Wanbaoshan area. I only saw fields going east and west, and houses lined up. Listening to their language, seven out of ten people spoke in the Qi-Lu accent. The other three were Koreans. Their country had been destroyed, and they had no home to return to. They were employed by others, only seeking food. Only in my notes, I only knew that there were Zhangjiabao and Wangjiabao, but I did not know that it was Wanbaoshan.</p>
<p>At that time, I almost suspected that the Peach Blossom Spring was not a fable. These Koreans were all destroyed and lost their homes, their pain tearing at their livers. Like Wang Shangsan's digging and cultivation, he gathered Koreans, clothed them, and fed them, so he could gain their strength. Wang Shangsan was killed by bandits, and the land he cultivated was owned by the Qi-Lu people. The Qi-Lu people enslaved the Koreans, and resentment had accumulated for a long time. The Japanese were also good at giving small favors, lending them money to make them settle down to cultivate and support their families. Therefore, my transporting wood on the Yitong River was thirty years ago. The Japanese worked hard to build the South Manchuria Railway and devoted all their efforts to it. Unlike the Chinese government, which was large and bureaucratic, it never asked about the people. For example, Zhang Luquan, the magistrate of Changchun Prefecture, said to me, "Since Wang Shangsan died, all the cultivated land in Wanbaoshan has been abandoned." In fact, the Shandong people illegally cultivated without the approval of the government, which had already laid the root of today's fighting.</p>
<p>Hao Yongde rented Xiao Hanlin's wasteland and organized a rice field company. How could he grow rice without releasing the water from the Yitong River? Koreans sub-rented Hao Yongde's company, which was a private transfer. Originally, the water irrigation was mutually beneficial. The Koreans were strong, and the Japanese helped them. This is why the Shandong people were dissatisfied, resulting in this major fight.</p>
<p>Oh, Korean Children!</p>
<p>He Tianjian</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Japanese drove Korean people to block our Yitong River and seize our Wanbaoshan fields. They also incited Korean people to burn and kill our overseas Chinese. I am indignant and write this.</p>
<p>There is a long whale in the East Sea, blinking its giant eyes.</p>
<p>It surges the sky's waves, sometimes competing with me.</p>
<p>China is my land, the Red County is my city.</p>
<p>Each has its own share of heaven, why forcibly annex it?</p>
<p>The Three Hans were originally my people, the beans and stalks were born together.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sacred artifact was lost, and they became barbarians.</p>
<p>They are innocent, and are made into fish and meat.</p>
<p>Black slaves have long been liberated, why are they still sacrificed?</p>
<p>My grief is not yet over, the cicada larvae are born.</p>
<p>They foolishly act as pioneers, becoming soldiers for others.</p>
<p>The Yitong blocks my water, and Wanbao stops my farming.</p>
<p>Still not satisfied, they drive the crowd to run away.</p>
<p>Hancheng staged burning and killing, a habitual skill of cutting off noses and tattooing faces.</p>
<p>Lu's blood splashed on Cai, the cold and heat have changed several times.</p>
<p>And now the flames are burning again, and ten thousand are used as fuel.</p>
<p>They claim to be protecting them, tigers and wolves leaning on each other.</p>
<p>Alas, my overseas Chinese, unarmed and unable to resist.</p>
<p>Their houses have been burned, and a group of villains are waiting outside the door.</p>
<p>Going in and out cannot avoid death, shaking the sky and shouting.</p>
<p>They are scattered for a while, and flesh and blood do not help each other.</p>
<p>How can I think about this time, life is as light as a feather.</p>
<p>Leaving the homeland for thousands of miles, a lonely person harmed in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Why do they dare to do this, diplomatic relations have been maintained for a long time.</p>
<p>Now it is the opposite, no different from throwing yourself into thorns.</p>
<p>Which country has no foreigners? Which country has no guests?</p>
<p>If the world is like this, how can the sun and moon be bright?</p>
<p>Tell the Korean children, how can you bear to kill your brothers?</p>

<p>Through the introduction of my dear friend Ma Mengrong, I met Mr. Xia Yizi from Jiangdu. Yesterday afternoon I went to visit. Mr. Xia was engaged in inkpad work, his hands were crimson. He quickly wiped them and came out to greet me, inviting me inside. I immediately felt a sense of antiquity and elegance, which made me envious. Mr. Xia has been studying inkpad for more than twenty years. The most valuable of its raw materials are: First, cinnabar, which is obtained from Yunnan and Guizhou, the so-called "Da Pi Sha" (大劈砂). As large as a longan, it is crystal clear like a gemstone when viewed under lamplight. Second, lotus silk, which is extracted from lotus roots and carefully refined before use. One qian of silk can only be extracted from one hundred catties of lake lotus. Its rarity can be seen. The use of lotus silk in inkpad is Mr. Xia's research achievement, which was unprecedented. It was first used in the finest inkpad because the cost is so high. Third, matured oil, which must be exposed to the sun and dew for dozens of winters and summers. What Mr. Xia uses has been treasured for fifteen years. Fourth, wild velvet, which is collected from the deep mountains and remote ridges of Sichuan Province, where people rarely go. It is soft and tough in texture, and then refined. All of these are not available on the market. Other ingredients, such as coral, agate, and pearls, must be carefully studied, with a balance of strictness and leniency, before success can be achieved. Being too hasty is like sand, while being too slow will cause it to not crack. Mr. Xia said that this work must be done personally. Once, a male worker said, "I would rather pull a cart all day than carefully grind for half a moment." Before he could reply, he had already run away. This is also a joke. Mr. Xia also said, "I have noticed that when calligraphers and painters create fan paintings, the seals they use are easily blurred unless they are dusted with pearl powder, which is not worthy of the exquisite works. I feel it is a pity. I have invented an inkpad that can dry immediately after being applied and cannot be wiped off. I plan to invite friends in the calligraphy and painting world to try it out." I was also treated to fine tea. The tea was picked from the highest peak of the Lion Peak, taking the tender leaves and making it with daffodil flowers. The water came from Huiquan and Hupao, and it was transported by a friend in Shaoxing wine jars that had not been used to hold wine. Mr. Xia is so fond of tea that he can be compared to Lu Yu and Lu Tong. Mr. Xia and I sat opposite each other, with a small table in the middle, on which were tea sets. He first poured water into a large teacup, took tea leaves and put them into the teapot. When the water temperature was right, he slowly poured it into the pot. After waiting a while, he shook the pot. Mr. Xia tasted it. It seemed that it was not yet ready. After another moment, we each poured a cup. As soon as I tasted it, the clear fragrance permeated my spleen. Mr. Xia said, "Drinking tea is a small matter, but there is a great principle in it. It is not just for quenching thirst. The water temperature must be just right, and the tea flavor must be mellow and harmonious. Then the sweetness will be long-lasting." After drinking four times, Mr. Xia said, "The taste is exhausted." There are still products made with plum blossoms, lotus flowers, etc., totaling more than thirty kinds. I will taste them with you in order. I said, "The phrase 'the fragrance lingers in the mouth and cheeks' can be used today." Mr. Xia smiled non-stop.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Foreign Ministry Will Make a Second Representation Regarding the Korean Case <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Demanding that Japan Take Real Responsibility</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese, after the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu arrives in Beijing tomorrow morning, the Foreign Ministry will make a second representation, demanding that Japan take real responsibility for this case and stating that China cannot be satisfied with the first reply. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain advisor said, "Since Japan acknowledges itself as the ruler of Korea, it cannot shirk responsibility for the Koreans' violence. Many people from various countries reside in Korea, and they will all feel insecure. Therefore, we hope that Japan will handle the aftermath properly." He also said, "Japan, facing political turmoil within its cabinet, wants to divert the nation's attention externally and incites Koreans to commit this atrocity. The tragic deaths of the overseas Chinese are no less than sacrifices to Japan's political turmoil. Is this not unjust?" From the perspective of international prestige and morality, Japan cannot shield the Koreans' criminal actions and must impose severe punishment. Furthermore, the officials responsible for maintaining public order in Korea should also be punished accordingly to uphold the spirit of their own laws. As for the right and wrong of the Wanpaoshan incident, it cannot be discussed together with the Korean case because the overseas Chinese in Korea were not involved in the Wanpaoshan incident." (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure in diplomatic circles said, "Japan insists on linking the Wanpaoshan case with the Korean incident, hoping to lightly evade its responsibility under international law. This clearly shows a lack of sincerity towards our protests. With so many Chinese compatriots killed and injured in Korea this time, Japan's responsibility is extremely clear. Yet, Japan still wants to shirk responsibility, only showing its unwillingness to be candid. The government will definitely not give up on this matter and must achieve the goals of compensation, punishing the murderers, issuing an apology, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again. As for the Wanpaoshan case, the government will also begin negotiations. Korean immigration has now reached over a million people, which has no basis in treaties. Legally speaking, this violates treaties for Japan and demonstrates leniency and negligence for China. However, how can this kind of negligence continue unchanged for so long? If Koreans follow the treaties, then their residence, travel, commerce, and cultivation in the Northeast should not be free. Behind the Wanpaoshan case, there was Japanese police leadership, giving people the feeling that wherever Koreans go, Japanese police follow. In short, unless Japan revises its laws, the fundamental problem of Koreans cannot be resolved." (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Wanpaoshan incident occurred, the Foreign Ministry protested to Shigemitsu and the Japanese government. Shigemitsu recently formally replied, stating that he had not yet received official instructions and claiming that Korean authorities had prevented the tragedy and protected the overseas Chinese, attempting to evade responsibility. The Foreign Ministry immediately instructed the International Affairs and Asian Affairs Departments to draft a reply to refute this, which is expected to be sent out on the 15th. It is also reported that the Japanese government's reply will be brought by Shigemitsu on the 15th. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone. Therefore, they issue a serious warning to the people of their own country, to seek ways to handle the aftermath well, and hope that Chinese compatriots will understand this difficulty. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters, considering that the Japanese and Korean rioters massacred overseas Chinese with extreme inhumanity, has ordered party headquarters in various districts to convene general membership meetings as soon as possible to discuss countermeasures. First, fixed propaganda teams will be dispatched as soon as possible to raise public awareness and unite in resistance, protecting overseas Chinese and avenging the shame.

He will contact Chinese consuls in various parts of Korea and the Governor-General's Office to conduct on-the-spot investigations and then go to Nanjing via Panyang and Beiping to report to Foreign Minister Wang. (14th Electrical Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In today's cabinet meeting, the former Governor-General reported the truth and the amount of losses in the Korean incident as follows: After careful investigation of the Korean incident, it is known that there was no prior plan or ideological background. It was merely revenge for the Wanpaoshan incident. The estimated amount of losses: 103 Chinese dead, 75 seriously injured, 46 slightly injured; 2 Koreans dead, 70 police officers slightly injured.

<h3 id="e5">Securities and Bond Prices Fall Again by About One Yuan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market saw few spot transactions, while the futures market was increasingly active. Trading was very lively both before and after the market opening. The 20th-year Customs Bond was more popular than other bonds. The 19th-year Customs, Welfare, and Disarmament Bonds also far outperformed before. It is estimated that over 23.8 million yuan were traded throughout the day, while spot transactions totaled only 5,000 yuan. Regarding the changes in the prices of various bonds, although the Northern clique still sold a large amount in the morning, the market's buying interest was also good, so the price changes, although weak, were only a few cents. The buying interest was slack in the afternoon, and the decline was slightly stronger. The closing was quiet. As a result, bonds such as the 19th-year Customs Welfare Disarmament bonds (August) and the Customs Consolidation (July) mostly fell by more than one yuan, while others also fell by about 70 to 80 cents. However, the stock of the Chinese Stock Exchange rose by 70 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Upward Trend of Yarn and Cotton Yarn is Confirmed <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market situation has eased slightly, but the bullish mentality views the Wanpaoshan tragedy as still serious. Refusal to accept goods may become a reality. There is no shortage of speculators buying in, so the overall trend is still strong. However, one merchant sold a large amount without price limits, and Rongxinghao also purchased a significant amount on behalf of a certain factory. As for the sales of spot yarn, activity has been seen again. Merchants from Tianjin and Guangdong are unusually enthusiastic, so 16-count and 20-count yarns are very tight. Unfortunately, the trade in coarse yarn is relatively sluggish. It is currently difficult to predict the market situation. It is found that both the bulls and the bears have considerable opposing forces.</p>

<p>At the opening of the human bid trading market, there were very large buyers, but a certain large holder sold according to the market, and the market atmosphere was affected, weakening, and prices fell by seven cents. The market situation was still good in the afternoon because spot sales improved, and each month rose slightly by one or two cents. The total transaction was 46,700 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 5,150 bales, Deji 2,400 bales, Hengde 2,500 bales, Shunda 1,200 bales, and Yuda 1,000 bales. Rongxing bought 4,700 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Yicheng 1,150 bales, Changfeng 1,450 bales, and Lichang 2,400 bales. The closing price of the human bid is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales remain healthy. It has been found that various merchants bought a total of 5,000 bales, and traders within the same industry purchased 1,100 bales. The market situation is firm. Merchants from Tianjin imported 1,700 bales, Hankou 475 bales, Guangdong 1,250 bales, inland 650 bales, northern merchants 100 bales, Shantou 340 bales, Xuzhou 100 bales, and Jiangxi 50 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is slightly soft, because the situation of American cotton is unfavorable, tending downward, and the price of gold has also weakened. Also, the weather has turned sunny, and there is no hope for spot cotton sales. Factories are suspending operations, so people's hearts are softening. However, Japanese merchants have not relaxed their attention on distant new cotton, so the market is relatively strong. However, near-month old cotton faces an uncertain future due to consumption disappointments and a lack of buyers.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Hankou standard trading market, prices fell following foreign cotton. Later, as the gold market weakened, prices fell again, each month down two or three cents. The afternoon was flat, up five cents to one cent. The total transaction was 37,700 dan. It was found that Changji sold 1,700 dan, Shenda 1,000 dan, Xinfeng 1,600 dan, Yongfeng 1,500 dan, and Shenchang 1,000 dan.

Indian cotton weakened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and long liquidation. Pyonggal fell 4 rupees, Omar fell 2 rupees, and Biroxi fell 5 rupees.

<p>Grain River Rice Market Gradually Tightens</p>
<h3 id="e14">Xinzha <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, twenty-two or three boats arrived from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Xianzi, with dozens of tubes of goods opened from the river. Prices were slightly better than before. Thick geng and early and late rice prices rose by nearly a corner. Luyang tip was sold as soon as it arrived, and the situation continued to tighten. The port tip's path became sluggish, showing a downward trend. Glutinous rice wineries and rice stalls had active sales, so prices also rose by five cents to one corner. Yesterday, two cars of Wan Ning passenger tip were loaded onto the Hu Ning Road, and the goods were piled in foreign warehouses. The sales disk has not yet opened.</p>
<h3 id="e15">South Market <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Sources from all routes were scarce, and Pu Cun was also weak. Due to the cold and overcast weather, urban and rural store sales had more intention to enter, and the market felt even more clamorous. Therefore, the price of thick geng rose by another corner or so. The actual price of thin rice production was not small, and the arrival and accumulation were scarce. Not many customers bought it, but the market was lively, causing the price to continue to rise by one and a half chi. Zhong Su also followed slightly. Luyang tip was affected by the increasing amount of foreign rice, and sales were active, and the price was also tightened. The shape was firm, and the sales of Yin Hua goods were rare and promising, and the trend was stable. Due to major floods in various places, customers are moving to handle foreign rice, and local buyers are following suit, and market prices are rising.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Futures and Spot Wheat Prices Rise Gradually <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, wheat prices have shown a firm and charming trend again. Although foreign wheat quotations continue to be small, three or four corners, the gold market has returned high, and exchange rates have shortened. Orderers cannot combine. Moreover, with continuous moldy rain, there is a risk of flooding in various places, and the low-lying farmland has already been flooded. Therefore, the inland gang's thoughts have turned firm again. Although buying is not very strong, the market has gradually become firmer. However, the local people are still lukewarm towards the factory's foreign wheat, which can be used in October, because the path of new wheat is very small. As a result, the price of this month rose by three cents compared to the previous week, August rose by three cents, September rose by four cents, and October, November, and December rose by five cents. In the spot wheat market, prices have become stable due to standard stability, and high-quality goods have been shouted up two or three cents. Medium and second-class goods are still flat. More than 4,000 packages of Kaitai, Dongtai, Wusong, Luodian, Penglai, Anting, Huangdu, Shuangfeng, and Wangxianqiao wheat were handled by Xinda, Huafeng, and Xiangxing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market area received electric messages that Cuban spot sugar and New York sugar futures had not yet arrived. Javanese spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. The public association market was even better, and demand was stronger, and prices suddenly rose. The transaction price of Dutch No. 24 coarse sand white was 11 taels, and the foreign firm's goods were 11 taels and 7 and a half cents. The market was quite charming, and the bank's intention was very strong. Therefore, Hao Pan Zhenxiang opened a spot offer of 3,500 bags, priced at 11 taels, and Jinfahao opened 2,000 bags, priced at 11 taels and 5 cents.

<p>The harvest of Jinshan branches this year is poor, and land prices are high, and the price is said to have reached 90 yuan, so the intention of the bank is extremely weak. Yesterday, a small number of Guangbang numbers in the North Market had arrived, including four boxes of Jinshan Yuanzhi, and the rest were more than ten boxes of Da Chaozhi. It is estimated that the market can be opened and tested today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai White Factory's sales to the United States were still immobile, and the French village's appetite was also weak, and the market was lonely. Yesterday, only Huatong entered ten packs of Shanghai White Factory, Weicheng entered ten packs of Huang Factory, and Xinshichang entered ten packs of Bai Gan, and the price remained firm.</p>

<p>More than 5,000 boxes were sold</p>
<p>The Russian Zhuang Association Foreign Firm, which sells tea widely, has not entered the market due to high tea prices. Now, because Ningzhou black tea has gradually become cheaper, the industry has begun to operate. Yesterday, it reached an agreement with Zhongxin Chang Tea Stack for more than 5,000 boxes, and it was heard that the price was 389 taels. There are still tens of thousands of boxes of Qimen black tea left in the bottom, and in recent days, British village merchants have not had a large amount of appetite. As for the green tea market, the sales of needle show eyebrows continue to be smooth, and the selling price is reversed. However, for Zhenmei, the goods from Tunxi, Suian, and Shexian have all fallen unanimously, and the market situation cannot be considered optimistic.</p>

In addition, the prices of various iron items have not risen or fallen due to the small amount of imports and exports.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Recent Overview of the British Automobile Industry <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>All industries in the world are declining. The automobile manufacturing industry has also been affected. A correspondent from a London newspaper recently provided an overview of the British automobile industry, as follows. Based on the facts, automobile manufacturers often display their new models at the automobile exhibition in mid-October. Therefore, to discuss the recent automobile industry, one must start from October. From October 1930 to March 1931, the number of newly registered automobiles was 74,184, a 3.1% decrease compared to the 76,550 registered during the same period last year. As of February 28, the total number of licensed automobiles was 839,262, a 4.3% increase compared to the 804,564 a year ago. As for gasoline consumption, whether it has decreased per car compared to before the commercial decline is uncertain, as there is no significant evidence. However, considering the recent rapid progress in small car manufacturing and the fuel efficiency of large cars, it can be asserted that the average mileage of each car is likely to increase. The automobile export industry shows few signs of decline. From October 1930 to April 1931, the number of British private cars exported totaled 12,600, compared to 18,037 in the previous year, a decrease of 20.2%. The markets in Ireland and South Africa have remained stable, while business in Australia has plummeted. The price of exported cars has fallen from £180 to £159 during the year. Simultaneously, imports have also decreased from 9,704 to 3,710. The average price of imported cars in April was £182, slightly higher than last year's £173.</p>
<p>Although there are no accurate figures for comparison with other countries outside of Britain, generally speaking, Britain's position is significantly more advantageous than its overseas competitors. British manufacturers' products account for 94% of the domestic market demand, compared to 87% a year ago. In other words, British manufacturers' products have decreased by approximately 2,300 units in the domestic market, while foreign exports have decreased by approximately 5,000 units. In reality, British industry has increased its sales by 2,500 units. The total number of cars sold in Britain (calculated by subtracting imports from domestic registrations and adding exports) from October to March totaled 81,912, a decrease compared to the previous year's 84,255. However, this loss is often offset by the decrease in imports. Considering the current situation, it is not bad. Britain's automobile exports are largest to Australia, especially in chassis exports. Therefore, the current economic difficulties in Australia have a significant impact on Britain. If Australia can overcome its obstacles, the British automobile industry will benefit significantly. The same applies to the political changes in India. The following table records the number of new registrations of private cars in Britain, including London, the Home Counties, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and other parts of England. The limited impact of the commercial decline on car registrations is noteworthy.</p>
<p>October 1930 to March 1931　October 1929 to March 1930　Percentage Decrease</p>
<p>London and the Home Counties　26,577 units　27,804 units　4.4</p>
<p>Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland　22,017 units　22,435 units　1.9</p>
<p>Other Parts of England　25,590 units　26,311 units　2.7</p>
<p>Total　74,184 units　76,550 units　3.1</p>
<p>Examining the horsepower categories of currently registered cars reveals a bright future for automobile manufacturers. Public preferences have also changed. Unfortunately, Britain, like a few other countries, does not publicly disclose statistics on automobile brand registrations. The 8-horsepower "baby car" still leads the way, with 20,139 new registrations from October to March, compared to 19,27 units in the previous year. This number demonstrates that 27% of current new car registrations are 8-horsepower small cars, while 17% of cars on the market are these small cars. Automobile manufacturers are making tireless efforts in manufacturing small cars. Prominent manufacturers such as Austin, Morris, Triumph, Singer, and Swift are producing many models, showing a trend towards simplification. A year ago, five prominent manufacturers produced a total of 23 models, while today they produce 28. Therefore, it may not be necessary for these manufacturers to face difficulties in lowering prices. Initially, due to Ford's plan to establish a new factory in Dagenham, with an annual production capacity of 50,000 cars for the British market, all manufacturers felt compelled to lower prices. 10-horsepower cars like Rover, Standard, and Swift are very popular and sell well. The number of new registrations this year is 8,167, compared to 4,743 a year ago. 12-horsepower cars, which were once popular, have now lost their position, with only 9,900 new registrations this year compared to 13,004 last year, a significant difference.</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy is that since the rise of the new Ford car, 15-horsepower cars like Morris, Armstrong-Siddeley, and Lagonda have seen slower sales and stagnation. The number of new registrations is 9,189, compared to 9,504 a year ago. The last three months have been particularly bleak. 16-horsepower cars like Austin, Crossley, Talbot, and Singer have also not fared well, with 8,816 new registrations compared to 9,197 sixteen years ago. Cars with more than 16 horsepower have suffered even greater blows, which is inevitable due to public economic constraints. The number of new registrations is 10,258, a 13.4% decrease compared to the previous year. However, there is still hope for the future of large cars. Although there is a current decline, they can maintain their position without further progress. Although the demand is not as strong as before, it is still relatively firm. The number of large car registrations is higher than that of imported American cars, indicating that there is still some hope for their future. Therefore, in summary, the decline in the automobile industry this year is less severe than in other industries. However, with Ford cars joining the price war next year, it is difficult to predict the future.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Another Advancement in Recent Automobile Engineering <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Using High-Pressure Principles to Increase Driving Speed</p>
<p>The automobile has seen continuous improvements in its manufacturing aspect to this day, almost to the point of being brand new every day. Besides all kinds of improvements, recently there has been another great advancement, namely using high-pressure compression to increase speed and economize gasoline. The desire to use high-pressure principles in the automotive world has been around for a long time, but various obstacles were too numerous to overcome, and it could not be realized for a time. After almost thirty years of hard research in the automotive world, in recent years, various obstacles have finally been overcome, and the so-called high-pressure engine can finally meet us, which is a great advancement in automobile engineering. Speaking of today's automobiles, even touring cars use high-pressure engines. The height of the pressure, if compared with the cars of 1926, has already been exceeded by a lot. As for the so-called racing cars, they completely utilize high pressure, and their pressure exceeds that of touring cars by a lot more. Judging from the recent situation and thinking about the future, in the near future, the manufacturing method of racing cars will likely become completely different from that of touring cars. If this is not the case, then the engine will not be able to adapt to its racing environment.</p>
<p>The automobile is able to start depending on the power of gasoline, and the reason gasoline can produce power is due to the effect of pressure on the vapor produced by the gasoline before ignition. Today, the average pressure on each vehicle's gasoline vapor on the market is five times that of the past. As for racing cars, it is ten or eleven times that of the past. For this reason, racing cars can get a large amount of power per gallon of gasoline. This power can increase the driving speed. As for touring cars, the extra power gained through high compression not only increases speed, but also has a significant impact on things such as increased propulsion and gasoline economy. However, if we want to distribute the extra power gained in accordance with the law to various parts, and utilize it without waste, it is an extremely difficult task. Speaking of today's trends in the automotive world, gasoline economy is probably the biggest problem. Therefore, increasing the pressure only saves gasoline, and does not increase driving speed. Saving gasoline is probably the biggest problem. Therefore, increasing the pressure only saves gasoline, and does not increase driving speed. The reduction of power, the convenience of propulsion, and the increase of speed can all economize gasoline directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>The aforementioned manufacturing of automobiles, such as using high-pressure principles, can save gasoline, which has been proven by Mr. Miller, an expert in manufacturing racing cars for Rolls-Angeles. According to his statement, a tank of gasoline can increase the range by up to 130 miles, and this type of tank can hold 8 gallons of gasoline. Moreover, simply moving the head of the engine slightly can increase the pressure, and on the other hand, the range of the combustion chamber can also be reduced. The convenience of operation is really something that was not possible in the past. In addition, there is another significant proof, that is, a high-pressure car and an ordinary car are loaded with the same weight of goods, and driven on the same road for a distance of 150 miles. The driving results show that each gallon of the 8 gallons of gasoline can increase the driving range by more than 4 miles.</p>
<p>In addition, another automobile factory also uses a method to prove the effect of high pressure. At that time, a six-cylinder car was used, and the compression ratio was reduced from four to one, so the pressure of the gasoline vapor was only a quarter of the original. The driving range per gallon of gasoline was 20 miles, and the speed per hour was 26 miles. Then, the height of the compression was increased to six times the original. Other parts did not seem to be affected in any way, but the driving speed was greatly increased. The driving range per gallon of gasoline was 34 miles. Based on the above, it can be seen that increasing the compression can both increase speed and save gasoline. It is truly a win-win situation.</p>

<p>— Song Yu</p>
<p>One Car for Every Four People: According to a survey by the American Automobile Drivers Association, there is now one car for every 4.6 people in the United States. This statistic is based on population census data. The total population in 1930 was 127,750,046. The total number of cars nationwide, including all 48 states and the District of Columbia, is 26,523,779 registered vehicles. This number includes passenger cars and trucks. California leads all states, with a ratio of one car for every 2.7 people. Alabama ranks last, with one car for every 9.5 people. New York is in the middle, with one car for every 5.4 people. The ratios for each state are as follows: Alabama 9.5, Arizona 3.9, Arkansas 8.4, California 2.7, Colorado 3.3, Connecticut 4.8, Delaware 4.2, District of Columbia 3.7, Florida 4.4, Georgia 8.5, Idaho 3.7, Illinois 4.6, Indiana 3.6, Iowa 3.1, Kansas 3.1, Kentucky 7.8, Louisiana 7.5, Maine 4.2, Maryland 5.0, Massachusetts 5, Michigan 3.6, Minnesota 3.4, Mississippi 8.4, Missouri 4.7, Montana, Nebraska 3.2, Nevada 3.0, New Hampshire 4.6, New Jersey 4.6, New Mexico 5.0, New York 5.4, North Carolina 6.9, North Dakota 5.7, Ohio 3.7, Oklahoma 4.5, Oregon 3.7, Pennsylvania 5.4, Rhode Island 5.0, South Carolina 7.9, South Dakota 3.3, Tennessee 7.1, Texas 4.2, Utah 4.4, Vermont 4.1, Virginia 6.4, Washington 3.5, West Virginia 6.4, Wisconsin 3.7, Wyoming 3.6.</p>
<p>Ford Factory Tours Various Cities: Ford Motor Company recently produced a sound film detailing the Ford car manufacturing process, assembly methods, and various manufacturing operations. It is being shown in cities, towns, and villages across the United States to provide those who have not visited the Ford factory with an understanding of car manufacturing. Because it is a sound film, watching it is like being in the factory itself. All aspects of the process, from smelting iron and casting steel to sawing wood and machining, can be seen in detail. It is both interesting and educational. Ford Motor Company produces thousands of cars daily, and the most crucial aspect of its manufacturing process is accuracy, ensuring that parts fit together perfectly during assembly. The film provides a detailed explanation of parts manufacturing and assembly, with no discrepancy, even in the slightest details. The film also shows all by-products of manufacturing. The planning and testing of these sound film tours have been underway for months, and the results have been remarkable. Therefore, multiple copies have been made to show in smaller towns. Additionally, various car accessories are displayed to complement the film.</p>
<p>Buick Cars Are Durable: According to a survey by Buick, many older Buick cars are still in common use. Some of these older cars date back to 1940, demonstrating their durability. Buick conducted a survey of car registrations in various counties in North America and found many older Buicks. Among the Buick cars in common use, 73,271 have been in use for ten years or more, and 2,500 have been in use for fifteen years or more. Approximately 115 have been in use for twenty years. Buick’s sales have been strong, with approximately 1.5 million Buick cars in use this year. With a total U.S. population of 122,000,000, one out of every eighty-one people drives a Buick. Considering families, one in every twenty households owns a Buick.</p>
<p>Two Million Cars This Year: Based on recent U.S. car sales figures, the outlook for car production and sales in 1931 is optimistic, and a new high record is expected. The profits of car companies are also expected to be the highest ever. Spring is usually the peak season for car sales. According to surveys, car sales across the U.S. in April showed no signs of decline. Based on this, the demand for cars in the summer is not expected to be significantly different. Given the strong demand this spring and summer, the sales for the entire year are expected to be quite impressive. Statisticians estimate that at least 2.5 million new cars are needed to replace old ones. However, even if only 2 million cars are sold, it would be quite satisfactory. Currently, the production and sales of Ford and Chevrolet cars have increased significantly compared to April. Ford estimates that over 125,000 cars will be produced in May, while Chevrolet expects to produce at least 110,000 six-cylinder cars.</p>
<p>Car Travel to Canada: Every summer, millions of Americans drive to Canada for travel. This summer, the estimated number of travelers is expected to be no less than 5.5 million. All these travelers will cross the international border into Canada. Most of the travelers come from California and the northern states. According to the Travel Department of the California Automobile Association, U.S. and Canadian customs officials at the Blaine, Washington border crossing will work around the clock, 24 hours a day, starting June 1st. Car travelers from the U.S. to Canada must present their state car registration certificates to pass the border; otherwise, they may face delays. Canadians exempt U.S. travelers staying in Canada for less than 90 days from all passport fees, tariffs, etc. Last year, 5,409,458 American cars entered Canada, of which 4,110,100 stayed in Canada for less than 24 hours. The number of cars entering Canada in 1930 increased by 900,649 compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Ford Model A Unchanged: The rumors that Ford cars would undergo major changes have proven to be false. The Model A cars displayed at the annual car show in New York have been improved but not significantly altered. In addition to participating in the New York car show, Ford also holds its annual car show at 1710 Broadway. According to Ford representatives, Model A cars are being displayed at various car shows across the country for public viewing. Regarding reforms, apart from necessary improvements, not many changes will be made.</p>

<h3 id="e43">The Situation After the Opening of the Eastern Hubei Automobile Road <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Xueqian</p>
<p>The construction of automobile roads in Hubei Province has been underway for a long time. However, the actual opening to traffic has been quite difficult. This is because the labor required is significant, the funding is substantial, and the mileage is long. Therefore, although the construction has been carried out separately in the four regions of northern, southern, western, and eastern Hubei, the results have not fully met the plan. The recent opening of the Eastern Hubei Automobile Road to traffic, although only for a few months, has been appreciated by travelers and merchants for its convenience. However, since the opening to traffic is just beginning, the facilities are difficult to be comprehensive. Therefore, the gradual improvement in the future is expected from the officials concerned with road administration. Speaking of the situation after the opening of the Eastern Hubei Automobile Road, since the road has been opened to traffic, the car road traverses hundreds of miles in Huangpi, Huanggang, Macheng, and other counties, and can be reached in a few hours. The ticket price is also not very expensive. Compared with the pre-traffic period, it took three days to travel from Hankou to Macheng, and the travel expenses were more than ten yuan. The difficulty of traveling cannot be described in a word. Therefore, after the opening of traffic, passengers are quite crowded. The distance from Hankou to Macheng County is about two hundred Chinese miles, and the ticket price is more than four yuan. Buy a ticket and get on the bus at Sanyuanli, Hankou, at about 6 am. Pass through Qiaokou, Hengdian, Huangpi County, and Huanggang's Lijiaji, Macheng's Songbu Qiting Zhongguanyi, and reach Macheng County. There are more than a dozen stops of various sizes along the way. The bus stops at the big stations, and occasionally does not stop at the small stations, depending on the number of passengers on the bus. This is the situation of the bus. As for the types of buses, there are freight cars, passenger cars, long tickets, and short tickets. About a dozen buses run every day. It is said that the Eastern Hubei Automobile Road Bureau has more than 20 freight cars and passenger cars. At the beginning of the traffic, there was very little cargo and more passengers. Therefore, freight cars are not needed much, and passenger cars are quite insufficient. The Road Bureau then temporarily placed long benches in the car for use as passenger cars to meet temporary passengers and benefit merchants. The form of the freight car is the same as that of the freight car in Hankou City. The form of the passenger car is the same as that of the public bus in Hankou City, but it is slightly smaller and cleaner. There are five benches horizontally arranged on both sides of the car. Each bench can seat two people, and each car can seat 20 passengers. There is an iron fence on the roof for passengers to place their luggage and sundries at any time. The station sells tickets. Each car originally only sells 20 passenger tickets. However, there are many passengers, and they often reluctantly buy tickets and get on the bus after the limit is reached. Therefore, each passenger car often carries 25 or 26 passengers. Because of this, the car is extremely cramped. Although this is taken by the passengers themselves, if the ticket seller can never sell again after the limit of each car is reached, the order of 20 people per car can be maintained. However, at the beginning of the opening to traffic, there were often soldiers who refused to buy tickets and forcibly boarded the bus. Moreover, people who intercepted and boarded the bus halfway were also seen every day. Previously, the Construction Department sent a letter to the 13th Division Xia Douyin's department stationed on the route to patrol and protect at any time to ensure the safety of travelers. After stipulating the preferential example of official soldiers in full uniform and symbols riding for half price, such things are no longer common. This is the situation of the car type and ticket sales. In short, the road was initially built and is muddy. Therefore, every time after the rain, the mud is ankle-deep, and the car cannot travel. The bus cannot run after the rain. Even after the rain, when driving a car, the road is often rolled into wheel ruts that are several inches deep. The mud dries and hardens after the weather clears, and it is not easy to return to its original state for a while. Therefore, the car is bumpy and the head is dizzy, just like the public buses in Zhabei, Shanghai, that travel to Jiangwan. The situation is the same as the Eastern Hubei car road every time it rains. The Construction Department is now working hard to improve it and is designing and constructing it. It is planned to pave the road surface from Hankou to Macheng with coal lamps first, so that the water will leak after the rain and will not hinder traffic. This is the situation of the road surface. I also heard that recently, during the large-scale suppression of bandits, the road is to prevent bandits from posing as passengers and mixing into the car for other purposes. Therefore, great attention is also paid to the inspection of passengers. In addition to the inspection when buying tickets and boarding the bus, the troops stationed along the way also inspect at each station at any time. The Construction Department has sent Wu Fu to carry out inspections above Huangpi. Because the inspection is thorough, no major accidents have occurred since the opening of traffic, which is safer than other automobile roads. As for the ticket inspection, it is also very serious. If it is not a formal</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>soldier riding in the car, even if he buys a preferential half-price ticket, he must make up the ticket when he is found at the destination station. This is the situation of the inspection and ticket supplement. Generally speaking, what this road urgently needs to improve at present is to add more passenger cars to facilitate travel. Because there are not enough passenger cars on this road, freight cars are often used as temporary substitutes. There are more than 40 passengers in the car, and at least 30 passengers. Although the freight car is slightly larger than the passenger car, the road surface is uneven, and the suffering of the bumps is even worse than that of the passenger car, which inevitably contains a lot of danger.</p>

<p>The British firm Jardine Matheson imported a state-of-the-art Wan Si Bo fighter plane from the United Kingdom for demonstrations in Shanghai, which was highly praised by Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance and people from all walks of life.

<h3 id="e46">General Motors Sales Soar <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>According to a report recently received by Mr. Mars, General Manager of the Shanghai General Motors Factory, General Motors' sales in the Americas and Canada accounted for 62% of the total number of cars in April of this year. If the sales in January, February, March and April are combined, they account for 50% of the total. According to last year's April figures, General Motors' sales accounted for 32%. Sales for the months of January, February, March and April last year accounted for approximately 35%. Compared with the two figures, the progress is obvious. It is commendable and enviable to have achieved such excellent results in a very short period of time. Most of the credit for this impressive performance should be attributed to the excellence of Chevrolet products. In total, the Chevrolet Company has more than 36,000 employees. Some of its factories have been working extra shifts since the fall of 1929 to catch up with the orders. In addition, the production of Buick, Oakland, and Pontiac cars has also increased. Sales of Oakland and Pontiac in April of this year increased by 40% compared to the previous month. This is the highest record since August 1929.</p>
<p>The overseas sales of various General Motors vehicles have also made significant progress. The total number of exports in April not only exceeded the previous month, but also doubled compared to the same month last year. It is especially noteworthy that the Yutoku Electric Railway Company in Japan used to carry passengers by electric train between Tokyo and Yutoku. Now, it has abolished the tracks and electric trains and replaced them with Chevrolet buses. This is sufficient evidence of the superior quality and excellence of Chevrolet products, and the reason for their ever-increasing sales.</p>
<h3 id="e47">New News from the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>Highway Bureau Renamed Management Bureau, Vehicle Increases Implemented in Stages, Construction Plan Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is a national leader in road construction and traffic. Since the establishment of the Provincial Road Bureau in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), it has been committed to planning and building highways. In the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), the National Government moved its capital to Nanjing, and each province established a Construction Department. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, recognizing the importance of highways, reorganized the Provincial Road Bureau into the Highway Bureau in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), expanded its organization, actively carried out its work, and formulated a major provincial road network plan and a five-year construction plan, which were implemented in stages. Priority was given to the construction of main lines. The budget for this year included the addition of 149 vehicles, the construction of the entire Shaoxing-Wenling line road surface, the Qiantang River highway bridge, and two Oujiang-Lingjiang bridges, increasing the total mileage to 1,300 kilometers. The shortage of funds amounted to more than 2.63 million yuan, which was paid by the provincial treasury. The highway construction plan has achieved considerable success today.</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the provincial government, Chairman Zhang Xian, in view of the large amount of government expenses in Zhejiang Province, which were insufficient to cover expenditures, compiled a new budget and implemented a austerity policy. Health and construction projects that had already been successful were merged and suspended one after another. The Highway Bureau was affected by this and has been reduced in size several times. However, due to the financial difficulties, it was difficult to maintain. Therefore, after the 400th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, it was decided to rename the Highway Bureau as the Highway Management Bureau, which would specialize in road maintenance. Vehicles would be increased in stages, and all plans and roads under construction would be temporarily suspended until the provincial treasury had surplus funds to handle them again.</p>
<p>The original route set by Zhejiang Province was more than 10,000 li, and only one-fifth of it has been built. Now, with the reorganization due to the austerity policy, the development of highways in the future may not be as rapid as in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Recent Situation of Roads in Guangzhou City <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Junchao</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Public Works has been sparing no effort in planning and building roads in the city recently. The following routes have now been planned and are being constructed in order:</p>
<p>(1) Sansheng Society Road: The route of Sansheng Society Road starts from Fengyuan Sandbank in Fengyuan Street, passes through Shilou Enzhou Straight Street, and ends at Sansheng Heng Lane on Sansheng Main Street. This road is the most important trunk road in Xiguan. The plan and materials have also been specified. The road surface is 60 feet wide and 5 inches high. The sidewalks on both sides are 12 feet wide. The engineering cost of the road is 97,500 yuan. The engineering cost of bridges and culverts is 45,000 yuan. The compensation for private property and relocation costs 50,000 yuan. The external expenses are 3,000 yuan. The total expenditure is 195,500 yuan. The road fee collected is 213,711 yuan, one dime and two copper coins. The income and expenditure ratio has a balance of 18,211 yuan, one dime and two copper coins. This money will be used to improve the road surface. The entire road plan has been decided by the Municipal Executive Meeting and will be constructed at the end of August of this year. (2) North Straight Street Road: The construction of Zhonghua Road in the city was originally divided into three sections. The southern section is Xiaoshi Street. The middle section is Sipailou. The northern section is North Straight Street. The construction of the southern and middle sections has been completed long ago. However, the northern section has not yet started. The route starts from Huiqing West Street, passes through Dade Straight Street, crosses Dexuan West Road, and ends at the intersection of the old Beida City Gate, connecting Xicun Highway, Panfu Road, and Zhenhailou Road. The entire line is 3,700 feet long and is also one of the important trunk roads. Bids are now being invited and construction can start in one month. (3) Dexing South Road: The Dexing South Road from Xidi Second Road to Xidi Main Road has long been measured and is ready for construction. However, the width of the road is slightly narrow. Therefore, the merchants and residents of the road recently jointly requested the municipal government to order the bureau to build the road in accordance with the width of ordinary roads in order to facilitate traffic. The municipal government therefore ordered the Bureau of Public Works to investigate and reply so that construction can begin immediately. (4) Xihu Street Road: This road starts from Xihu Street, passes through Dayoucang Road to Weixin Road and Guanlian Street, and reaches Jiaoyu Road. (5) Renji Main Street Road: This road starts from Renji Main Street and reaches Haizhu Road. The plans for all the above roads have been completed and will be constructed soon.</p>
<p>(1) Xianhao Street Road (2) Zhoutouzui East Street (3) Laolong Street Road (4) Yuanhe Tongjin Road (5) Baoyuan Ninth Street to Fengyuan East Street Road (6) Baiyun Mountain to Guangfan Flower Road: The above roads are in urgent need of planning.</p>
<p>(1) Jiuxin Street Road (2) Youlanmen to Banxiang Lane Road (3) Suoyi Street to Huangsha Road (4) Haiqiu New Embankment Road (5) Penglai New Street to Guangdong Road Factory Road (6) Second Pu to Fifth Pu and Xihe Road (7) Eleventh Pu to Mibu Road (8) Guanmin Market to Xicun Pingdan Road (9) Eleventh Pu to Duobao South Road (10) Ronghua West Twelfth Pu Road (11) Dongshan Qian Street to Eshi Liao Shahe Road (12) Yuexiu South to Dongshan Zilai Street Road (13) Wenchang Lane to Shanglongjin Road (14) Wuxian Straight Zengsha Nan Huilongli Road: The above roads are all under construction. Guangzhou, after the completion of each road, its municipal administration will surely become a model for the country.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Chinese Braided Elastic Fabric Industry Presents Significant Progress <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Observations from the Japanese Side</p>
<p>According to the Eastern Daily News, an article submitted by Sotomi Tetsujiro, the chairman of the Japan Braided Elastic Fabric Industry Association, states that the Chinese braided elastic fabric industry has recently shown significant progress and development. Six years ago, there were only five companies in Shanghai organized as braided elastic fabric factories. According to a survey last year, the number of company-organized factories has reached 41, with an investment of 1,575,600 yuan and 6,536 workers. Furthermore, factories are also being added in Tianjin, Hong Kong, Wuxi, and other places. As for the amount of braided elastic fabric exported from Shanghai, it was 231,872 dozen four years ago, and it increased to 421,928 dozen last year, approximately doubling. The sales route of Chinese exported braided elastic fabric is also in Southeast Asia and India, which are the main sales routes for Japanese exported braided elastic fabric. The Japanese exported braided elastic fabric industry feels quite threatened by this. Furthermore, an investigation into the reasons for the development of the Chinese braided elastic fabric industry shows that (1) the prices of raw materials, cotton and cotton yarn, are relatively low; (2) manufacturing labor costs are low. In addition, there are three strategies for the Japanese exported cotton product industry to counter the Chinese cotton product industry: (1) abolition of cotton yarn tariffs; (2) granting of bonded factories; (3) suppression of work shortening.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The United States Establishes New Maritime Transport Policy <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Sets Up Ten Committees</p>
<p>New York News: Since the European War, the United States Shipping Board has adopted the principle of "American goods in American ships," aiming in principle to have American ships carry more than 50% of American goods. According to a recent survey, only 47% of imported goods and 32% of exported goods are carried by American ships, far from the goal. Because the Shipping Board wants to establish a maritime transport policy, it has established ten committees, including the American Goods in American Ships Committee, the Fast Ship Postage Investigation Committee, and the Foreign Trade Investigation Committee, and ordered them to submit investigation reports separately by July 1. It intends to establish a new maritime transport policy based on this and submit a proposal to the next Congress. It believes that after President Hoover's international debt proposal is realized, the economy will gradually transform and the movement of world materials will increase, so it hopes to thoroughly implement the principle of "American goods in American ships."</p>

<p>Due to the Impact of Italian Goods and Low Silver Prices</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Japanese rayon fabric exports have increased in quantity due to falling prices. The export volume from January to May was 49,558,000 square yards, worth 14,633,000 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, the price decreased by 11,053,000 yuan and the quantity increased by 14,143,000 square yards. Among them, the export volume to China from January to May was 413,000 square yards, worth 168,000 yuan. In the same period last year, the volume was 989,000 square yards, worth 568,000 yuan. This is because the impact of Italian products and the decline in silver prices have significantly reduced exports.</p>
