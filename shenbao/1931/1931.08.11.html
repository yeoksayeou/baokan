<h3 id="c13">緊急之民食問題（一） <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>此次洪水爲災。徧十六省區。湘贛江浙等産米區域。亦皆淹没。全國淹没農田及損失稻麥。目前尙無統計。但將來調查完竣。數目字之鉅大。蓋可想見。據各報所載。安徽各屬已發生搶米風潮。江浙各縣米價。頓時大漲。即就上海市言。近日每石米價亦已陡漲至十七元有奇。是則此次水災救急之振濟。固不容刻緩。而横梗於吾人眼前之民食問題。亦至爲緊急。假如不早爲籌謀。則將來民食一斷。民苦飢荒。搶米風潮。恐將不止於一地。而飢民挺而走險之行動。亦將不止於搶米。人禍常繼天災而來。吾人於此。絶不容絲毫忽視。也</p>
<p>我國本以農業立國。以常理論。年産食糧。即無嬴餘。要亦可以自給。但自近十餘年。天災人禍。連綿不絶。田皆荒蕪。民苦流離。於是民食乃歲感不給。而仰給於外洋之輸入。據海關報告。民十米之進口爲二千一百萬担。出口僅爲八萬六千担。民十七米進口總數爲一千二百萬担。出口不足三萬担。其他麥麫粉等食品。尙不在内。過去旣已如此。益以此次之水災。則未來民食問題之嚴重。當更倍於曩日。如此嚴重緊急之問題。豈僅危及我民生。抑更深關我國計。</p>
<p>王制記虞夏殷周四代倉廪之法。有云·「國無九年之蓄曰不足。無六年之蓄曰急。無三年之蓄曰國非其國也。」周官司徒之屬亦云。「掌鄰里之委積以恤艱。危縣鄙之委積以待凶荒。」孫中山先生在建國方略中。論食物之輸出亦有云。「每一城鎭。須有一年食物之貯積。更有所餘。乃以售之於外國。」而今我國家則何如。豈僅無九年六年三年以至一年之儲積。抑且無日不在飢餓威脅之中。民安得生。國又安得爲國。</p>
<p>瞻顧前途。杞憂無旣。故謹於叢評水災之後。更一談民食問題。深願國内明達。共一注意於此。急謀善後。以打破來日之大難。</p>

<h3 id="c63">（三）滿鐵操持下之鐵道 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>在上段中。吾人旣已言及日人爲變相的完成其鐵道綱系計畫。輒假中日合辦之美名。强迫投資我國。建築新路。或强迫包築。迨鐵道旣成。債亦高積。無法清償。日人更把持其重要地位。但求有利於彼。任意支配。年復一年。名爲我有。實則全入於日人之手矣。</p>
<p>在滿鐵操持下之鐵道。計有下列數線。</p>
<p>（一）吉長線　由吉林省垣至長春。長共七九·四哩。於民前三年起工。民國元年竣工。由滿鐵貸欵。并由我國委託滿鐵管理。實際上該路已脫離我國而嵌入滿鐵之範圍中。爲我國借欵建築犧牲之第一條鐵路。</p>
<p>（二）吉敦路　由吉林至敦化。長共一三一·○哩。於民國十五年六月起至民國十七年十月竣工。由滿鐵貸欵包工。工程窳敗。價值昻貴。預算决算數目。更任意變動。實際路權。則全在日人之手。</p>
<p>（三）四洮路　本線自四平街起。迄於洮南。支線自鄭家屯起。迄於通遼。共長二六四·六哩於民國五年四月起工。民國</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>十二年十一月竣工。由日本正金銀行與滿鐵貸欵建築。沿線物產豐富。貨運甚繁。經濟價值極鉅。但事實上亦爲南滿鐵路之營養線。</p>
<p>（四）洮昂路　起自洮南。迄於昂昂溪。長一四一·七哩。於民國十四年三月起工。民國十五年七月竣工。由滿鐵貸欵建築。此線可與東鐵對抗。吸收東省北部之貨物、由大連出口。故日人極願投資建築。　　（五）金福路　起自金洲。迄於城子幢。長共六三·四哩。於民國十五年五月起工。民國十六年九月竣工。由滿鐵貸欵五五九·○○○元。中日兩國人集股建築。　　（六）天圖路　起自地坊至老頭溝。朝陽川至局子街。長六九·○哩。於民國十一年八月起工。民國十三年十月竣工。爲中日官商合辦。此路爲吉會路之東段。至關重要。原來日人於圖門江中韓界務條約。取得吉會鐵路建築權後。即無時不謀其實現。但以我國人誓死反對。計無所出。及變更方策。不言修路。而言開礦。不用日政府名義。而用日商名義。不向我中央政府要求。而向吉林省當局要求。以朦混我國人之眼目。開始敷設。中間更歷經多次之交涉。卒底於成。日人用心之所在。蓋可想見。近聞該路由滿鐵收買。已接洽妥帖。果眞。則吉會路之南段已實現矣。一髪千鈞。國人其將奈何。</p>
<p>（七）溪域路　起自本溪湖。迄於牛心台。長一四·七哩。於民國二年十月起工。民國三年二月竣工。由中日商合辦。建築之目的。專爲運送牛心台所產之煤。</p>
<p>上述七路。共長七六三·八哩。名爲中日合辦。或我國所有。實則大權旁落。操持由人。我已無法過問。根據過去之事實而觀。日本對鐵道借欵。大概持有兩項堅决之中心政策。即</p>
<p>（一）壟斷東三省南部與熱河一帶之鐵道</p>
<p>借欵權。反對任何第三國投資。反對中國自資建築鐵道。</p>
<p>（二）務使一切鐵道借欵。皆由滿鐵會社承借。</p>
<p>此種鐵道借欵之目的。又有四。（一）所建之路。必爲滿鐵之培養綫。（二）賺得利息。（三）參加監察或干涉鐵路之管理。（四）爲將來直接管理之伏綫。日人之計劃如此。懲前毖後。茲後國人其慎重深思。再勿墮人圈套之中。</p>
<h3 id="c64">（四）滿鐵會社經營之事業 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>滿鐵會社在其出版之滿洲課本中曾有</p>
<p>自供狀云。</p>
<p>「本會社負有開發滿洲經濟文化之使命。以發展我國民（日人）之健實。標榜平日兩國共存共榮主義以經營百般的事業。南滿洲之天地。已顯然見得一個共榮國家之出現。……本會社……於鐵路運輸事業之外。尚兼營海運業·港灣業·鑛山業·製鐵業·工業·以及滿蒙產業之發展、會社所管地方內各種土地·建物·術生·教育之施設。與調查事業之實行。名爲鐵道會社。實質上乃一個全備國家諸機能的執行機關」。丨滿洲課本二一○丨二一一頁。</p>
<p>此種供狀。一方面顯示日人之趾高氣揚。藐視我主權。直以開發我東北爲其應負之使命。另一方面更顯示其手段之陰險。口言共榮。實則以「南滿洲之新天地」。發展彼國民之健實。盜攫我寶庫。且盛稱其整理保管之功勞及支配用途之得當。爲主人者。其將何以自處。而滿鐵會社對我東北之迫害。實無異於東印度公司之於印度。直爲日本對我東北侵略之大本營。</p>
<p>吾人試一檢視滿鐵會社經營之事業。除以鐵路經營爲主要事業外。（倉庫工塲在內）其他海運。港灣·鑛山·農業·製鐵·電氣·以至於旅館。及其他警備。教育·調查等。無不肆力經營。近更計劃製鐵事業之擴張。及經營油頁岩製油。硫安化學肥料。曹達工業等大計劃。其勢力之深入我東北。根牢蒂固。樹植日本殖民之根基。豈僅驚人。實更可憂。茲將該會社經營之事業。分別略述如下。</p>
<p>（一）鐵道　鐵道之經營已略如上述。至</p>
<p>於鐵道附屬事業。（甲）倉庫營業。據一九二七年統計。進機爲五百二十四萬噸。出棧爲五百二十八萬噸。每日平均庫存數三十四萬噸。倉庫之外。並辦保險。（乙）工塲營業。計有沙河口工塲。遼陽工塲。蘇家屯木材防腐塲。大連電氣修理塲。就中以沙河口工塲。規模尤爲宏大。專製造機車貨車客車。現該地與大連之間。通有電車。已成爲一小工業都會。</p>
<p>（二）海運　自清光緒三十三年間。開始經營。現已讓與大連輪船株式會社。不復直接經營。但資本三百萬元。則全爲滿鐵會社所有。（未完）</p>

<p>海輪全部停航</p>
<p>天文台與江海關、昨因本埠將有颶風、遂於下午四時後鳴砲、通告各輪公司、預先防範、致沿海航輪、完全停開、詳情調查如下、</p>
<p>天文台發警告　徐家匯天文台、昨日上午十一時、特别警訊、謂颶風顯已擴展至浙江北部、以及寗波一帶、馬鞍山方面、並有劇烈的旋風、聞此次風之吹來、係在東經一二三度·北緯二七度·由琉球以南諸島、向西北西進行、昨日上午、颶風已過温州洋面、風力至强、且有暴寸記者昨遇我國航海專家王君、據謂渠測觀天時氣度、苟風勢進行方向不變、則預計今晨一時左右、吹到上海、王君又言、昨日午後之微寸即爲颶風將到之預告、王任海輪船主十餘年、其言似可信也、</p>
<p>懸警球發警砲　昨日午後四時許、愛多亞路東口沿浦江天文台氣候台上、已高懸報警大黑球、兩邊又掛多風警信號、爲通告行駛江面之各商輪、至四時三十五分、江海關浦東陸家嘴扯旗台亦在台頂高懸黑色大警球、同時開放警砲一響、以警告航輪界先行預防、浦江内駁船·小輪·划子·渡船·及舢舨等等、聞砲立即靠泊碼頭、與駛入内港、以防顚覆之禍、</p>
<p>寗波輪船停航　今回大風、自琉球經温州洋面舟山羣島來滬、昨午四時許、招商三北、接得寗波新江天及寗興輪發來電告、謂因避風、未能由甬開出、現均留停寗波、又太古新北京·寗紹·新寗紹·應於昨日出口赴甬、自得天文台與海關警告後、即宣布停航一班、當發通告、改明日出口、其已上船旅客、退票後紛紛離舟登陸、各自還去、</p>
<p>温州輪船避風　滬台班與温州班輪、昨日出口舟山號等輪、亦均臨時停航、宣告展延一天、招商局温州班輪嘉禾號、前日由滬開出、未到温州、即遇大風、昨據該輪電告、已在中途抛停暫避、可無危險、</p>
<p>沿海各輪遲開　沿海各商輪應由今晨出口者、若太古新疆號·宜昌號·等船、均係開往汕厦港粤之南華各埠、爲颶風吹來必經之路、昨日、該公司已將各該輪出口期展延一天、其已經出口者、則由各輪局發無線電、通知各輪、着在吳淞口抛泊、暫铁出海、以免危險、而進口各船、則提前駛入浦江、</p>
<p>浦江小船預防　昨日午後五時起、黄浦江面之貨駁渡划等各小船、已各提前停航、而在各碼頭卸清貨物之民船、則紛紛駛入蘇州河暫避、故入晚江面上已無船舶行駛、惟長江船、以不經海道、仍擬開出、</p>

<p>監誓訓詞　首由司法院監誓代表蘇希洵訓詞、略謂、今日本人代表到此、參與兩院長宣誓、甚爲榮幸愉快、此次收回法公廨之最大目標、一方面係實行收回法權、一方面係完成法權統一、茲者由外交上之努力、民衆的後盾、將八十年障碍法權之畸形組織取消、而成立中華民國地方上兩法院、則收回法權已實現、統一法權已完成、惟司法院尙有二點、謹當轉致於諸公之前、（一）兩院本身、在草創伊始、一切設施措置及應興應革之事、當然應兼籌並顧、以致完善、但在初着手之時、事實不免稍覺困難、故須熟審利弊、謹愼將事、以逐漸的改良而解决一切困難、（二）要期副一般人之願望、自當有較好之成績、而成績之優劣、尤有待於努力之程度若何、譬如成績以一百分爲標準、若能達到九十分、則其成績自屬優良、若猶不到半數、則尙須加以努力、固甚明焉、希望兩院諸君以十分之精神、去十分努力與奮鬥、使法院前途、成一極佳之成績、以彰中華民國立法的精神、據余個人感想、兩院長與兩院諸君、均係學識豐富、經騐充足者、將來定可副政府與人民之期望、且可於今日預賀成功云、</p>
<p>黨代致詞　市黨部代表童行白致詞云今日來參加兩院宣誓典禮、同時於非常快慰之中、包含着沉痛的感想、夫土地人民與主權、爲任何一國家立國精神的要素、何以我國有此不健全的病態、當然是帝國主義侵奪權限、同時我們應該回顧以前的痛苦、而加倍努力、宣誓、在一般人之觀察、似乎係完全一種形式、但總理當時認爲是最重要的工作、故舉行宣誓、是實行總理遺敎之一點、而在宣誓者、亦得以此警惕自勉、猶有幾點、亦即拳拳貢獻於諸公之前、（一）法律、做法官的須有根據與責任、如違反誓詞、即不免生責任問題、（二）道德、法官於負有法律責任而外、同時能注意於道德問題、深知兩院法官、素爲衆望所歸、將來一定有良好之成績、（三）過去之法公廨、因受外人的挾制、外交的牽制、致使無法可以整頓、此種痛苦、於收回後、定可减去、一切整頓、定可進行、雖其間不免有積重難返、一時不能奏效者但在應有改革之處、總宜極力設法整頓云、</p>
<p>來賓演說　市商會代表王延松演說、略謂此次撤消法公廨、成立中國止式法院、實爲可喜之事、此後法租界居民、當有「法」的保障、現任法官、均爲學識湛深、經騐宏富者、加以廉潔之操守、公正之態度、預料將來成績、必有可觀、整個法權收回之實現、更當以此爲發動、寗非商界之幸、實爲全國人民所共同屬望也云云、餘從略、</p>

<p>肺癆療法之新發見</p>
<h3 id="c126">德國肺病療養雜誌抄譯 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<h3 id="c127">何謂肺癆菌？ <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>肺結核菌（即肺癆菌）係桿狀之細菌。其體形眞直。或稍　曲。長徑約一迷達之百萬分一五。非肉眼所能見。據一定之方法。以熟練之手段。製爲染色標本。用六百倍至一千倍之顯微鏡檢視之。始克窺知。實爲極小之物也。</p>
<p>古昔之時。中國名之曰癆咳蟲。現今則人皆知結核菌爲肺病之蟲。不屬於動物界之系統。蓋吾人之周圍。有無數之下等微生物存在。即通稱么微有機體。爲肉眼所不能見。此么微有機體。分爲動物性與植物性二種。屬於動物性者曰原始蟲。屬於植物性者曰黴菌。此下等植物之黴菌。屬於隠花植物之一科。無葉綠素。黴菌之中。又視形狀質。分爲「絲狀黴菌」「芽性黴菌」「分裂黴菌」之三種。</p>
<h3 id="c128">肺癆菌之殖民政策 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>分裂黴菌之繁殖。本諸自身之分裂作用。即自一而化爲二。自二化爲四。日漸增加。故有分裂黴菌之稱。人類及他種動物。往往因之發生疾病。故稱日「病原菌」因形狀之不同。又分爲「球狀黴菌」「桿狀黴菌」「螺旋狀黴菌」之三種。肺癆菌即分裂黴菌中之桿狀菌。</p>
<p>肺癆菌。在肺病患者之痰中。混之最多。常視患者病勢之輕重。而有增減。據德國海角雷兒博士謂。肺现患者之痰一塊中。含有三萬萬之結核菌故小時内咯痰一次者。一晝夜中有七十二萬萬之結核菌。自結核患者之體内而排出。散布於空氣中。世間之人。日夜被其侵襲。然此多數之病菌。果何自而生乎。蓋分裂菌之本體。有分裂作用。已如前述。其日漸增加繁殖者。職是之故。起始時原屬一個黴菌。其後日漸分裂。由一爲二。由二爲四。依次遞推。增殖之勢力。日漸廣大。今試假定增殖之速力。每一小。營分裂作用一次。則二十四小時内。一個之黴菌。已化爲一千六百萬個矣。由是以觀。則下述之事項。可推測而知。</p>
<p>（一）黴·菌·繁·殖·力·之·如·何·旺·盛</p>
<p>（二）究·因·何·故·而·患·者·之·體·中·、發·生·無·數·病·菌·、</p>

<p>肺結核菌之抵抗力。非常强盛。推知其抵抗力之大小。爲肺病豫防及治療上之最緊要者。結核患者之痰。故置空氣中時。結核黴菌之生存。可達半年以上。置於光線缺乏之暗室内。則一年以上。尙得保其生存。此種黴菌。對於寒冷之抵抗力。尤爲强大。遇攝氏零下十度之寒冷。經六七星期而不死。對於温熱之抵抗力。亦較他種黴菌爲强。他種黴菌。遇攝氏六十度之温度。經二三十分鐘。便行死滅。而此種黴菌。須八十度之温度。經二三十分鐘。始克死滅。惟對於日光之抵抗力。最爲荏弱。遇直射之日光。經五六分鐘便死。遇攝氏百度以上之温熱。一二分鐘便死。若就消毒藥而論。肺病患者之結核菌。在二十倍石炭酸水中。歷三十秒鐘而死。在百倍石炭酸水中。歷一分鐘而死。在千倍昇汞水中。歷十分而死。</p>

<p>肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌，市此菌一入人體内，則於該處，便成結節，以斷血行之路，又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質，包圍其體，以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入，故雖用種種殺菌藥，内服或注射，終不能達其病菌之實體内，歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法，對症療法，埋學的療法，血清療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等，尙未売全成功，而肺病無藥之說，遍滿於一世者，因未知此深奥學理故耳。由此現代結核學者，根據上述之學理，繼續研究，不遺餘力，結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑，名曰三那星Sanosn此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者，據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告，此藥有滲透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟質之作用，　　有殺菌力，能根治一二三期之肺癆，確有萬試萬靈之特效，在中國，業經國民政府中央衛生試驗所化驗，藥性和平無毒，絶無任何副作用，茲略舉醫治作用於下，</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中，實驗「三那星」之藥力作用，則一分鐘後，結舉醫治作用於下，</p>
<p>分鐘後，則此肺結核菌，完全殺盡，無一倖免，</p>
<p>（二）依動物試　，則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病　内，設檢查其病寵内潛伏之結核菌，則盡失其抗酸性，此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣，</p>
<p>（三）如患者内　「三那星」一星期左右，則立見咯痰稀釋，體熱下降等良好狀態，</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上，則顯見體重增加，食慾激進，一切症狀，逐漸緩和，終達其回天再造之　功，</p>

<p>風雨二十餘日。一旦濕雲忽散。皓月呈空。豪客置酒。災民待哺。一樣對月而哀樂不同。感而賦此。</p>
<p>濕雲繞屋廿餘天。蟄居渾似井底眠。四壁淋漓苔綠滿。蝸牛挺角亦放顚。大江南北田禾厄。阡陌東西水接連。老農仰屋歎無策。單郟空遺治水篇。今宵忽聞雨聲息。窗外黑雲隨風捐。須臾雲散月輪出。有如曉妝之蟬娟。雲　亂擁梨花面。掩映蛾眉劇可憐。瞬間雲塊忽東至。狀似毒龍踞斗躔。光射其頭勢突兀。猛撲冰輪吞其全。恍似美人歸叱利。懊惱情懷無可宣。但見四際餘輝射。若絲若縷又若拳。風姨突叱阿香去。妖雲始脫姮娥旋。有如文姬歸漢士。有如驪珠出重淵。清影萬邦共欣賞。奈他災民殘喘延。舍南舍北浮白浪。或有蕩析無遺椽。此時仰月感奚似。自有愁歎與嗚咽。華堂置酒彼何意。珍饈奇餚不論錢。越姬吳娃醉偎倚。路人望之如神仙。此際望月快何似。人間萬事無拘牽。嗚呼明月一樣望。哀樂竟同霄壤然。吾亦逡巡不忍看。任他皓魄窗外圓。</p>
<h3 id="c184">談小高而夫 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 愚工</p>
<p>去年的六月中。美國忽然的興行了一種新頑意—小高而夫—不多時便風行全國。現在流行到上海。變成最時髦的一種娛樂了。今將小高而夫的一切。隨便談談。</p>
<p>小高而夫的緣起　起初有一位墨西哥的湯姆生先生。和美國德士古州的亞培特先生。要玩高而夫。但是墨西哥和德士古州的地。含沙太多。很不適於高而夫。他們没法。就來個雛形的高而夫來過過癮罷。於是用人工造了一點泥草。裝了點假山小水。在天井裏頑了起來。後來有人覺得有機可投。於是大加裝飾。花樣翻新。美國人的脾氣向來是一窩蜂。一唱百和。於是小高而夫成爲一種新頑意了。</p>
<p>小高而夫發達的原因　大高而夫費用大。需時多。除了富豪公子哥兒們。有錢有時候。才能頑。像美國普通人。一早就上公司。到下午五點才回來。休息一刻。天已晚了。自然没有時候頑了。小高而夫可在室内。不論日夜。不怕風雨。又費時不多。無怪大家要趨之若鶩了。</p>
<p>美國小高而夫的情形　美國小高而夫球塲據去年八月的調查。有二萬五千家。每家的設備費約五千元。總投資已達一萬二千五百萬元了。普通每家的收入是二百元一天。那末。一月後。本錢便賺回來了。許多公司專替人家家庭造人高而夫塲。每片自十二元至五十元不等。靑年人捨電影而頑小高而夫的很不少。所以有些生意清淡的電影院。都改爲小高而夫球塲。有些大輪船公司。爲吸引乘客計。也添了這一項娛樂了。</p>
<p>上海的小高而夫熱　自小高而夫自美流入上海後。一時爭相效尤。打小高而夫也變成摩登條件之一。滬西有一家用電來管理山洞橋樑等。洞門一開一闔。吊橋一吊一放。你要在洞門開時吊橋放下時打才得過去。雖然比較難些。却很有味。也可算是别開生面的了。</p>

<p>胡不特精於脈理。深乎佛敎。且於詩亦爲特長。於虞洽老五十周紀念會中。曾睹胡自撰自書立軸。寫作俱妙。别具風格。外子曼倩。罹二期肺疾。就胡醫。旬日間即由重轉輕。由輕而愈。日前小倩又病。以呀呀學語之三歲稚子。其病情自難探悉。余乃伴送至閘北香山路胡寓請爲診治。蓋此次余爲第一次訪胡。入室四壁琳瑯。滿室皆書畫。中案佛像。俱出名家手筆。胡待人謙恭多禮。言及病人最宜茹素。因菜蔬富於營養力。非葷菜可比。况在夏令若能避葷就素。可免去一切時病。余茹素十的。從未得小疾。有以致之也。如費先生之病。宜多誦「阿彌陀佛」。因彼之病。係多費腦力及神經衰弱所致。凡操筆墨生涯多絞腦汁者流。類多犯此症。若多唸佛號。則心目中只知有佛。不知有他。可避去許多思慮。其病不難霍然。人多謂余信佛而令人信佛。實誤會余之見解也。余聞語。稱是至再。偕小倩道謝而退。（不受酬）</p>
<p>短訉　漢口近有人集大宗資本。創立一百貨商店。定名新華公司。不亞於海上之先施·永安。内設凌霄遊藝場。規模宏大。百戲雜陳。近特派專員姚友邦李斐叔君等來滬邀角。舉凡滬上游藝名角。皆在羅致之列。日内即行起程赴漢。聞廢歷八月一日正式開幕云。</p>
<p>出版界消息　三日刋兒童畫報爲兒童最良好之讀物。其種種優點。已詳聖涵君所作專供兒童閱的報紙一文。其定價全年連郵一元九角。半年連郵一元。定報處爲。「浙江紹興小校場十一號兒童時報社」云。</p>

<p>美人與印人感情甚好。吾人因計劃兩亞運動。即亞細亞文化與亞美利加之和平運動也。中華可作媒人。使亞洲精神文化與美洲物質文化結婚而産生新太平洋之太平文化。因按地球之運。從幼發拉底河流域起。以至希拉羅馬法國英倫全歐。渡大西洋而興美國。又渡太平洋而興日本中華以至暹羅印度天方。今太平洋正當其王運也。將來使最老之印度化。與最新之美國化對流。而中國其接線。因從上海至美國。與至印度。均二禮拜半之程也。此兩亞宇運動成化。即未至全球大國。而第二大戰可息矣。史特退願游中國日本。蓋我所遇各印人。有智識者。無不渴望中印合作。及亞化聨合。復興東方文化也。余言印人有數千年之第一等殖民地。而不知善用之。歐人之殖民地。在屬地。而印人之殖民地在人心。全佛敎徒皆其殖民也。若能聨合。全球可變化。而况印度乎。此其時矣。沙彌言余乃信佛者。但用科學比較方法。印度敎之短。在階級制。佛之短在恭維權勢與富人。但俄國盡敎富人。亦落因果。將來須擇一最善之路。造一全球花園。去殺相愛乃可也。</p>
<p>余在印度。所遇博士如林。大宗敎家智慧如海。生令勃勃。有突出西人之上之勢。宜乎新潮運動日盛。印度前途誠未可量也。印人頗輕視耶敎。學生告我曰。耶蘇一木匠兒子。何所知。吾印度敎人。不能與他敎人共食也。余告之。言君不知耶蘇。試遍查四福音。無一說恭維資本家者。故回駱駝若可穿過針鼻。資本家也無升天之望。可知耶蘇乃平民運動家。不若佛之圓滑。但富人亦恨耶蘇。故被上十字架。耶蘇未可輕視也。又他學生深惡階級制。願改信佛敎。問余何以解除階級制。余告以拉好學生會有大運動。廢除階級制。可與通信合作。</p>
<p>自歐戰以後。印人加入歐戰。智識大開。印度各地往往有會造手槍炸彈者。亦常與官府及印度之偵探互殺。非眞全無抵抗也。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>把客人送到了車站之後，也不再接旁的生意了，就拉了車子回家去。小夥計還是嘮叨講小榮的事，他認定自己一些没有看錯人；講得小榮的父親終於不能不相信了，也只得深深地嘆息。</p>
<p>到得家裏，就把這件事講了出來：小榮的妻子這才記起來了，伊說：「公公丨這一定是小榮了！方才我也在車站上瞧見的，他同着一個女人在一起；只是我自己一時糊塗，偏以爲自己看錯了人，所以輕易放過了他；現在聽小夥計一說，就什麽都明白了。」伊說得幾乎哭了出來。</p>
<p>「眞會是小榮的麽？他前天才去的，怎麽今天又回來了呢？而且還帶了一漂亮的女人！又是誰呢！又是誰呢？我想，也許不見得眞是小榮吧！」小榮的母親還有些不相信。</p>
<p>「怎麽不是小榮！他還親口和我說過話哩！」小夥計說。</p>
<p>小榮的父親眞有些憤怒了，這時，他也很相信方才坐在他車子裏的便是小榮。所以他就吩咐小夥計趕快到鐵路飯店走一躺，把小榮喚回家來。</p>
<p>小夥計就奉命而去，到了鐵路飯店之後，先看看水牌上，再也尋不見陸小榮的名字，只得去問賬房問裏的人：「一人個男的和一個女的，是今天從上海來的，在幾號房間裏？」他說。</p>
<p>「笑話！上海來的一男也多得很丨我怎知道你尋那一個？姓什麽？呌什麽？」賬房先生帶着笑說。</p>
<p>「姓陸，呌小榮！」小夥計只知道這一些了。</p>
<p>「没有的！今天姓陸的客人一個也没有！」賬房先生向循環簿上約略看了一看，就這樣回答着。</p>
<p>小夥計没有法子，只得回去覆命。闔家的人也祇有暗下納悶，一些也没有法想。後來，倒是小榮的母親想得一個法子，伊呌小夥計明天一早起來，就去候在鐵路飯店的門口，他旣然住在裏面。不怕他不出來，等他出來，就可以拉着他回家了。</p>

<p>新閘　裏路到頭頗稀、本街交易不見十分暢旺、且聞各處水災、人心更緊、因社會局訓令限價、最高白粳不得超過十七元以上、近來河下存積缺乏、實因客方血本關係、受其影響、内中有三　眞特别貨、開出十九元外、店戶每石　貼二元、北粳薄稻·洋尖。蘆尖·埠尖等各漲七八角、糯米昨到二筒、當即如數斛脫、形勢趨緊二角、新粳與南頭相彷、</p>

<h3 id="c227">社會科學槪論 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 梅咏賡</p>
<p>郭任遠著</p>
<p>社會科學的勃興、不過是最近幾十年來的事、現在中國著作界關於社會科學的論著、風起雲湧、很多是專門研究這新興的科學的、</p>
<p>我現在所要提出來介紹給讀者的、是郭著「社會科學槪論」一書、</p>
<p>社會科學是研究會生活的種種現象而求出牠們的定理及定律的各種科學、凡人羣組織的本身、政治活動、經濟活動種種方面、都是有很複雜的鈕帶、中國今日、當大革命的潮流澎湃激盪、毁滅了固有的社會組織、於是社會上呈現着一種不安的現象、當然、我們應該在社會科學中找出自救的方法、</p>
<p>二十世紀的人類社會生活、彼此關連、日見密切、美國的金價漲落、可以影響到中國内地一個小農家的生活、總之、自從經濟組織形成了一個全世界大體系以來、自國家政治戰爭、以至人民的飲食男女日常生活、無不互有緊密的關係、牽一髮而動全身、正是今日社會的實在現象、這一切的問題、我們又都應在社會科學中去找尋解决的方法、</p>
<p>我們又知道、革命是兩方面的、一方面是政治和經濟的、而另方面則爲革除民衆心中固有的陳腐的思想、前者在國民革命軍統一了全國以後、大體上總可以說是完成了、而後者則自今的訓政時期的工作、便正在實施而尙未獲得相當效果、而唯一補救的方法、則是在努力灌輸現在的社會科學的智識、給一般普通民衆、使他們了解現代政治經濟社會的情况、而努力於新的創造、</p>
<p>郭著社會科學槪論、最大的優點、便在他用混合的方法來編輯、使初學的人知道社會現象是相互關係的、著者在序言中說、</p>
<p>「……社會生活本來是整個的、全體的、可是這種現象非常之紛繁、人們爲便利研究起見、把社會分做好幾種、但是這種分類最不合於初學、因爲恐怕初學者不能了解社會現象的全體性和整個性的緣故、這本書因爲要避免這個危險、所以用混合的方法來編輯、……」</p>
<p>不錯、社會科學的學問、好比無邊無岸的大海、初學的人、往往只見社會現象的片斷及獨立的部份、而不知政治·經濟·法律等等現象、是互相關係的、互爲作用的、並不是各自獨立的、而這本書便能使讀者得到一個社會現象的全體性的槪念、</p>
<p>其次、這書的優點、只在講社會生活的事實問題、而極力避免學理的討論、著者全以叙述社會生活爲主、自己很少參加任何意見、或作任何主張、我覺得著作社會科學書籍的學者、如偏重學理、則必使初學的人看了如墮五里霧中、莫名其妙、故初學的人、宜看偏重事實的書籍爲宜、這書便是偏重社會生活的事實而力避學理的討論的書、這又是本書的一個優點、</p>
<p>這本書是社會科學入門的書、故其内容只作扼要的叙述、供給一般初學者最爲適合、</p>

<h3 id="c229">八十五歲的女記者 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 鴻</p>
<p>美國屋海屋州的愛麗絲凡昔克夫人是美國年紀最大而最活動的女記者、她今年已經有八十五歲了、但她仍極熱心的從事於此業、她的言行有許多是很有趣味、而值得我們注意的、</p>
<p>現在她是屋海屋五家報館的記者、她每一星期更從無線電中報告新聞、千萬的家主婦的耳朶裏、常常可以聽到她的聲音、並且她還替罪犯的機關報寫文章、有暖常去和罪犯談話、</p>
<p>她住在康丁頓地方的一個簡樸的小房子着、她終日忙碌、所以背也曲了、走路時用一根手杖、頭髮已成爲白色、但是目光仍炯炯有神、</p>
<p>她的確是一個有天才的新聞記者、她在十四歲時就做了一篇愛情故事登在某週報上、從此就開始了她終身的大業、</p>
<p>她結婚以後、有許多别的事務奪去了她的時間與精力、生活不安、幾至中絶她的終身大業、但是因爲她意志的堅定卒未中止、</p>
<p>她一生常常帮助别人、帮助父親、帮助病弱的丈夫去撑支門戶、料理家事、一次有一家報館的主人因欠工資而遭打擊、她曾帮助他工作、日夜不息、她是加入美國印刷業聨合會的第一個女子、</p>
<p>她的關於年紀的哲理、發表得很多、</p>
<p>她說、「無論男女、過了中年之後、總不肯再繼續的追求他們早年未曾得到的成功、這並不是因爲他們體力或智力的喪失、而是因爲他們的願望較前减少、目的漸弱、其實因體力智力的喪失、而得到的報償、丨丨豐富經騐、正確判斷、及成熟的智力、丨丨有時所得遠過於失、」</p>
<p>「所困難者、就是過了四十五歲或五十歲以後、許多人就不肯再去嘗試、他們無志去做他們能力還可以做的事、所以他們停止工作、他們承認衰弱、他們老了、我所以能保持着我的年幼者、完全是因爲我繼續工作、這是無可疑義的、」</p>
<p>在一九二九年的屋海屋女記者聨合會中、她的文章得到了第一奬、她說、「假如你肯長久的工作下去、你定可以得到成功、我這次所以能得到第一奬的、就是因爲我對於此道、已花費了六十年的功夫了、」</p>
<p>她致力於著作生涯已　十年、但她仍無退休之意、她說、「假如你對於你所成就的事業、認爲滿意、那你當然可以退休、假如你對於你所成就的、還認爲不滿意、那你爲什麽要退休呢、最好還是繼續的努力下去、」</p>
<p>她又說、「年老不僅是較年幼爲更快活、而且更有趣味、更爲成功、年紀是一種資産、他使我瞭解人生、」</p>

<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>我擬就下面的計劃書、（一九一八年七月二十四日）、</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>德軍第五次進攻自開戰即遭頓挫、結果完全失敗、</p>
<p>法國第十和第六兩軍採取攻勢把德軍擊敗、</p>
<p>我軍必須乘勝進取、各軍全力追擊不懈、其影響遠遠超過這次戰事的本身、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>敵軍的敗北成爲聨軍策劃作戰方略的基礎、</p>
<p>現在敵我兩軍的形勢如下、</p>
<p>我軍已經獲得了同敵軍相等的兵額、惟師的總數我軍還没有占到優勢、</p>
<p>德軍爲形勢所逼不得不調動這樣多的師部作戰、我軍後備隊遂第一次占優勢、更以敵軍不能不把許多疲師退出火線休養、我軍因在生力後備隊的數目上又將同樣的占着優勢、</p>
<p>况且、各種情報均證明敵人已把其軍隊分成兩部、一部兵力薄弱、用以守住防線、專供犧牲、另一部駐在這虚弱的防線之後、怖置應戰步驟、這部軍隊雖由德國最高司令用心訓練、但戰鬥力已大受打擊、</p>
<p>聨軍的空軍和坦克砲更無不占優勢、美軍砲隊開到了之後、我軍在砲兵方面的實力一定大大的曾加、</p>
<p>末了、在聨軍的後方、美軍每月有二十五萬人潮湧似的開到法境、成爲後備隊的勁旅、敵人方面、我們已經曉得他爲救濟五月份兵額接濟的恐慌、曾一度採用緊急辦法、現在他更遇着維持前敵各軍兵力的困難、新恐慌的發生已露端倪、</p>
<p>物質的方面、我軍漸占優勢、開戰以來敵人雖以空前的兵力猛攻、卒未能獲得他必須達到的决勝、我軍常能維持軍心、現在大勝之後、軍心更見振作了、</p>
<p>大戰全局已到了轉機的關頭、聨軍已進步到轉危爲安改守爲攻的地位、聨軍的兵額和作戰的主義均許其維持這個進攻的優勢、</p>
<p>聨軍向來因兵力的缺乏不得已而採取守勢、現在已到了改取攻勢的時機、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e4">Negotiation Policy Regarding the Korean Incident <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan Completes Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee held a meeting today to review Huang Youchang's proposal regarding the Korean incident and the negotiation policy for the Wanbaoshan Incident. It is said that the majority of committee members believe that the massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans has developed into an unprecedented tragedy. Not only did they fail to maintain order, but they even assisted in the violence. The Japanese side should bear full responsibility for this case. In addition to the Japanese side compensating for losses, punishing the perpetrators, and issuing an apology, they also advocate advising the Koreans. It is said that the review of the negotiation plan has been completed and will be submitted to the Yuan's meeting this Saturday for discussion. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japan's Second Response Regarding the Korean Incident</p>
<h3 id="e5">Rumored to Have Been Delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Japanese sources, Japan's second protest response regarding the Korean incident has been delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, containing five points: (1) The anti-Chinese movement in Korea in Showa 2 was caused by the oppression of farmers in Manchuria and Korea. This anti-Chinese movement is still based on the Wanbaoshan Incident as the real cause. (2) When the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred, the Governor-General of Korea, in light of the Showa 2 incident, was prepared for all contingencies. Although 119 people died, all the deaths occurred in Pyongyang, with no casualties elsewhere. It can be said that the Governor-General's measures were not inappropriate before or after the incident. (3) In a country ruled by law, the state has no responsibility for individual affairs between individuals under international law. (4) Therefore, Japan has no obligation to compensate for losses in the Korean incident. (5) Japan should address the victims by moving beyond theoretical issues and providing automatic relief.

This was discovered by our aircraft, which dropped dozens of bombs and notified nearby garrisons to be vigilant via communication bags. When the bandits fled east from Liantang on the 4th, our army launched a fierce attack, and fierce fighting continued until the 5th. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Chiang Dingwen personally led his troops in a fierce attack on the bandit's rear, defeating the bandits, killing 3,000, and seizing 1,300 rifles.

The bandits rob houses everywhere and flee extremely quickly without baggage. Our army is having difficulty carrying food because the bandit areas are completely emptied. Although the bandits have fled west, they are far from their lairs, making interception easy. The troops on the front lines are advancing rapidly towards southwestern Jiangxi. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang dispatches report: (1) The bandit troops of Huang Gonglue, entrenched in Yudu, have recently shown signs of movement and are planning to cross Wan'an and infiltrate Suichuan.

<h3 id="e10">Fan Guang Reports on Diplomacy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Wanbaoshan Incident Has Headway Towards a Resolution</p>
<p>Absolutely No Relaxation on the Recovery of Concessions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 10th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' commemorative week was held, and Deputy Minister Fan Guang reported: (1) The Wanbaoshan Incident has made headway towards a resolution. According to Zhong Yu's report, the remaining 27 Japanese police officers in the area, along with their firearms, were completely evacuated under the supervision of the Jilin Provincial Government on the 8th. The remaining matters should be resolved soon. After several protests regarding the Korean incident, Acting Chargé d'Affaires Jiang, stationed in Japan, has been repeatedly urged to send a reply from the Japanese side, which is expected to arrive by Monday or Tuesday this week. Ambassador Wang reports that the Ministry is reviewing it and will decide on appropriate measures upon the Minister's return to Beijing. (2) Recent reports have stated that residents in western Shanghai are requesting the expansion of the Public Concession. At a time when the people of the country are striving to recover the concessions, this news is astounding. Even if the Chinese have lost their minds, they would not dare to make such a request. However, in reality, it is nothing more than a joke. Matters concerning national sovereignty cannot be forfeited by the private intentions of one or two people. Upon hearing this news, the Ministry telegraphed Shanghai to investigate. The response was that no such documents had been issued by any party. Even if there were irrelevant letters, they have no legal basis since they were not signed or sealed. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association therefore sent a letter to the Municipal Council, urging them to announce the original text of the letter and the names of those responsible for signing it, and issued a declaration expressing their attitude towards this matter, confirming the conspiracy. At the same time, citizens of Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai jointly submitted a petition to Party and government agencies, requesting a thorough investigation. The Caojiadu Public Association is also making every effort to investigate the truth of this matter. It has now been discovered that this matter is entirely a trick by ignorant foreigners in Shanghai, the so-called "Diehards." The Ministry is paying close attention to this and will not relax its efforts to recover the concessions, no matter what despicable means they use to protect their interests in China.

<h3 id="e12">National Budget Overview <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The total national budget for fiscal year 20 divides revenue into eleven categories, with tariff revenue being the largest, followed by salt tax, consolidated tax, stamp duty, and tobacco and alcohol tax. Revenue has increased significantly compared to the previous year. Expenditures are divided into thirteen categories, with military expenditures being the largest, followed by debt service, subsidies, and financial expenditures. The original budget reports submitted by various agencies showed significant differences between revenue and expenditure. After the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics made substantial reductions and reorganized the overlapping expenditures, the calculations now show that revenue and expenditure are balanced.

<h3 id="e13">The Urgent Problem of People's Food (1) <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>This flood has caused disaster across sixteen provinces and regions. Rice-producing areas such as Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang have also been submerged. There are currently no statistics on the total area of farmland submerged and the loss of rice and wheat nationwide. However, once the investigation is completed, the enormity of the figures can be imagined. According to various reports, rice riots have already occurred in various parts of Anhui. Rice prices in various counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have soared. Even in Shanghai, the price of rice per shi (unit of volume) has suddenly risen to over seventeen yuan recently. Therefore, emergency relief for this flood cannot be delayed. The problem of the people's food supply, which is looming before us, is extremely urgent. If we do not make plans early, then the people will suffer from famine once the food supply is cut off. Rice riots may not be limited to one location, and the actions of starving people taking risks may not be limited to looting rice. Human disasters often follow natural disasters. We must not neglect this in the slightest.</p>
<p>Our country is based on agriculture. In theory, the annual food production, even if there is no surplus, should be self-sufficient. However, in the past ten years or so, natural and man-made disasters have been continuous. The fields are barren, and the people are suffering from displacement. As a result, the food supply has been insufficient for years, and we have had to rely on imports from foreign countries. According to customs reports, rice imports in 1921 were 21 million dan (unit of weight), while exports were only 86,000 dan. The total rice imports in 1928 were 12 million dan, while exports were less than 30,000 dan. Other foods such as wheat flour are not included. The situation has been like this in the past, and with the addition of this flood, the severity of the future food problem will be even greater than before. Such a serious and urgent problem not only endangers the people's livelihood, but also deeply affects the country's plans.</p>
<p>The Royal System records the methods of granaries in the four dynasties of Yu, Xia, Yin, and Zhou, saying, "A country without nine years of reserves is insufficient. A country without six years of reserves is urgent. A country without three years of reserves is not a country." The Zhou official Situ also said, "Manage the accumulation of neighboring villages to relieve difficulties. Manage the accumulation of dangerous counties to prepare for disasters." Sun Yat-sen also said in The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction regarding the export of food, "Every town must have a year's worth of food stored. Only if there is a surplus can it be sold to foreign countries." But what is our country like now? Not only is there no storage of nine years, six years, three years, or even one year, but it is also constantly under the threat of starvation. How can the people live? How can the country be a country?</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the worries are endless. Therefore, after commenting on the flood, I would like to talk about the food problem again. I deeply hope that enlightened people in the country will pay attention to this and urgently seek solutions to break the great disaster that is coming.</p>

Representatives from Huai'an, Huai'an, and Bao counties, including Lu Youting, requested that the two sluice gates of the Shuangjin Salt River be opened. Sun agreed to offer a reward of 1,000 yuan to open them because the sluice gates were not opened when the water first arrived, making it difficult to extract them now. Sun returned to Gaoyou by way of engineering projects the morning of the 10th. The villagers of the third, fourth, and fifth districts of Huaiyin vehemently opposed the Huaiqi section of the construction office's plan to release the Qian Ting Dam. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Soong Ching-ling arrived in Harbin this morning. Due to a train delay, she arrived at the station at 8:05 AM. Various dignitaries from Harbin went to the station to welcome her. She rested in the VIP room for half an hour before transferring to the Harbin-Changchun train at 8:55 AM to head south. She stopped in Liaoyang for six hours before going directly to Dalian to board a ship to Shanghai, where she is expected to arrive on the 14th. Soong Ching-ling is in good spirits but remains tight-lipped and does not talk much to people. Her companions include her female friend Hu Lanqi, a former member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and her male friend Zhang Minyi. When reporters boarded the train to request an interview, Soong Ching-ling said that she was tired and avoided them in another carriage, instructing Hu Lanqi to meet with them instead. Madam Sun's return to China is purely to attend her mother's funeral. She left Germany on July 13th and did not stop along the way. She spent six hours in Moscow. She will take a ship from Dalian to Shanghai on the 11th and is expected to arrive on the 14th. Madam Sun has been living in Europe for two years, traveling to France, Germany, and Switzerland, and has not been involved in domestic politics. Although she has received continuous telegrams from Beijing and Guangzhou, Madam Sun has not replied to any of them. It is uncertain whether she will travel again after returning to China this time. According to Hu Lanqi, she is in Germany to study economics on the orders of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. When Soong's train passed through Manzhouli station, Ma Jinggui, the director of the Agricultural and Mining Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, accompanied the train to Harbin. Furthermore, a Russian reporter mistakenly boarded Soong's train while it was in Russia and traveled to Harbin with her. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Motion to Dissolve Parliament Fails</p>
<p>Less Than Forty Percent Vote in Favor</p>
<p>Berlin Communists Clash with Police</p>
<p>Two Police Chiefs Killed, One Police Officer Injured</p>
<p>Bomb Explodes on Express Train</p>
<p>Suspected of Being Politically Motivated</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th - The final unofficial results of the referendum show that 9,784,000 people voted in favor of dissolving the Prussian Parliament, representing 37% of all eligible voters. Thus, the motion to dissolve Parliament has failed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th - The referendum closed at 5:00 PM today, and the votes are currently being counted. The final results will be released late tonight. However, it appears that the National People's Party and the Communist Party have failed to secure the 13,250,000 votes necessary to dissolve the Prussian Parliament. Voting was generally peaceful. The number of people detained for obstructing police duties and distributing prohibited leaflets has reached 70. Berlin police have been harassed by Communists who set fire to street advertising pillars, broke streetlights, and hung a red flag on Berlin's highest chimney. The flag was later removed by firefighters. A British journalist who attempted to photograph voters was beaten by Communists but was not seriously injured. Another dispatch states that the votes in favor of dissolving the Parliament have fallen short of the required majority, with only a few towns in East Prussia voting in favor of dissolution by 50%. Most urban residents did not vote, so the extremists' plot to overthrow the Prussian government will definitely fail. Reports from areas supporting the National People's Party have not yet arrived but are unlikely to affect the overall situation. At 8:00 PM, of the 6,250,000 eligible voters, only 34.3% voted to dissolve the Parliament. Most Communists did not vote, but members of the National People's Party did not give up their right to vote, especially women. There were multiple clashes between parties and police tonight. Two police chiefs were killed and one police officer injured in a brawl with Communists in front of the Communist headquarters on the Pulu Street. Police then used bayonets to disperse the crowd and searched residences and passersby. Gunfire has not yet completely ceased, but the police appear to be in control of the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th - It is now known that the police chiefs killed on the Pulu Street were shot dead without provocation. The police are furious and are now taking extremely strict measures, locking down the entire city. Police cars are patrolling the streets with searchlights, and all windows along the way are ordered to be closed, otherwise they will be shot at. Several ordinary civilians have also died, but the claim that a total of 15 people have died has not been confirmed. There have been minor clashes between political parties in many provinces and towns. According to police reports, one person died and fifteen were injured during the chaos on the Pulu Street.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 10th - Gunfire was still occasionally heard this morning, but it has now completely stopped. However, police are continuing to search for the person who assassinated the police chiefs. Anyone passing through the Pulu Street area must raise their hands to be inspected by the police. There was a clash between Communists and National Socialists in Schurenberg. The police intervened and arrested 14 National Socialists and 64 Communists.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th - This morning, as the express train from Basel to Berlin was traveling to Gutteboog, a bomb exploded on the tracks, causing seven passenger cars to derail. This was clearly the work of political fanatics, but it is not yet known which party they belong to. A newspaper of the National Socialist Party was found on a telegraph pole near the scene of the accident, with the words "Revolution Coming Soon" written on it in pencil. This was likely intended to make people suspect the National Socialist Party. The party has denied any involvement in this act of violence. The State Railway Bureau has offered a reward of 1,000 pounds to capture the person who planted the bomb. The fact that an express train carrying passengers from Italy was deliberately destroyed the night before the referendum is quite alarming. It is speculated that the destruction was intended because German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius were returning on this train. Therefore, those who planned the bombing must have intended to target the Chancellor and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 10th - German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius returned to the capital from Rome this morning. A large crowd gathered at the station to welcome them. After returning to the Prime Minister's residence, Brüning immediately drove to the Presidential Palace to meet with the President and report on the meeting with the Italian Prime Minister.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Revolution Brewing in Cuba <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>National Press, Havana, 9th - Revolutionary tides in Cuba are brewing. The government has declared martial law and ordered troops to the town of Buyano near Havana, as it is rumored that the Nationalist Party is gathering there and planning to join the rebels in attacking the Presidential Palace in Havana. Troops loyal to President Machado captured 17 leaders and killed three during a Nationalist Party attack on a fortified building. Seven political police officers were also injured. It is now known that the mastermind behind the rebellion is former President Menocal, who is cruising in a yacht in the port of Buyano. He was discovered by police today but managed to escape. Only his son was captured. The revolutionary tides in Cuba have been brewing for two months, as the Nationalist Party alleges that the President's term has expired but he has illegally extended it, causing resentment and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Cotton Loan to Germany Has Yet to Be Completed</p>
<p>World Markets All Affected</p>
<p>National Press, New York, 9th - Businessmen, speculators, bankers, stockbrokers, and others around the world are all eagerly awaiting the opening of the commodities and securities exchanges tomorrow morning. The US Department of Agriculture announced on Saturday that the US cotton harvest is expected to reach 15,584,000 bales, compared to only 13,932,000 bales in 1930, an increase of 2 million bales over this year. Therefore, there are fears that the cotton market will fall further, causing chaos in the US agricultural situation. The British predict that US cotton will fall by two cents to a price of six cents per pound. If so, the world's cotton industry will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>National Press, Manchester, 9th - Lancashire cotton industry leaders predicted today that US cotton will fall by three pence when the market opens on Monday. Manchester experts say that if such a large drop occurs, cotton growers around the world will be severely hit.</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 9th - Those who are experienced in observing the market believe today that the Farm Relief Board may respond to requests to continue buying cotton in order to stabilize prices. Although the area of cotton fields has been reduced, the projected harvest is still larger than in previous years. If the Board does not intervene to maintain prices, the price will likely plummet. The problem is that the Board currently has 1.1 million bales of cotton in storage. A few days ago, it attempted to loan cotton to Germany, but the deal has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Denchu, Tokyo, 10th - Due to the US cotton harvest forecast, the cotton market in Tokyo and Osaka was in great turmoil today. Osaka cotton yarn futures fell sharply, and the Sanpin market was therefore closed. Yarn mills are mostly only purchasing cotton for the near term, only 120,000 to 130,000 bales, resulting in a daily loss of six yuan per catty. Since the cotton yarn has already been ordered, the loss can be offset. The greatest losses are in the cotton yarn industry.</p>

<p>National Press, Basel, 9th - The International Banking Committee, organized by the London Seven-Nation Executive Conference, held its inaugural meeting here this morning to investigate Germany's financial needs and consider the possibility of converting part of its short-term loans into debt. The first meeting lasted three hours. Walter Stewart, President of the National City Bank of New York, was elected Chairman. Then, Merkel, a major shareholder of the Hamburg Merkel Bank and German representative, analyzed Germany's financial situation and provided the necessary records for the preparatory meeting. It is expected that the committee will discuss the outline here and then go to Berlin on Saturday to conduct on-site investigations. Although the committee has complete autonomy in carrying out its work, it must cooperate closely with the Bank for International Settlements. Due to the heavy workload, it may take several weeks to complete the task.</p>

<h3 id="e63">(III) Railways Operated Under the Control of the South Manchuria Railway <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In the previous section, we have already mentioned that the Japanese, in order to complete their railway network plan in a disguised form, often used the name of Sino-Japanese cooperation to force investments in our country and build new roads, or forced contracts to be built. By the time the railway was completed, the debt was also high and could not be repaid. The Japanese further controlled their important positions, seeking only benefits for themselves and arbitrarily dominating them. Year after year, they were nominally owned by us, but in reality, they all fell into the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The railways operated under the control of the South Manchuria Railway include the following lines:</p>
<p>(1) Jichang Line: From the provincial capital of Jilin to Changchun, a total length of 79.4 miles. Construction began three years before the founding of the Republic and was completed in the first year of the Republic. It was financed by loans from the South Manchuria Railway and managed by the South Manchuria Railway entrusted by our country. In reality, this road has been separated from our country and embedded in the scope of the South Manchuria Railway. It is the first railway sacrificed for our country's loan construction.</p>
<p>(2) Jitun Road: From Jilin to Dunhua, a total length of 131.0 miles. Construction started in June of the Republic Year 15 and was completed in October of the Republic Year 17. It was financed by loans from the South Manchuria Railway and contracted. The project was poorly constructed and expensive. The budgeted and settled amounts were arbitrarily changed. The actual road rights are entirely in the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>(3) Sipingjie-Taonan Railway (Sitao Road): The main line starts from Sipingjie and ends in Taonan. The branch line starts from Zhengjiatun and ends in Tongliao, totaling 264.6 miles long. Construction started in April of the Republic Year 5 and was completed in November of the Republic Year 12. It was financed by loans from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the South Manchuria Railway. The area along the line is rich in products and has very busy freight transportation and is of great economic value. But in fact, it is also a feeder line for the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>(4) Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway (Taoang Road): Starting from Taonan and ending in Ang'angxi, it is 141.7 miles long. Construction started in March of the Republic Year 14 and was completed in July of the Republic Year 15. It was financed by loans from the South Manchuria Railway. This line can compete with the Eastern Railway and absorb goods from the northern part of Eastern Province for export through Dalian. Therefore, the Japanese are extremely willing to invest in construction.</p>
<p>(5) Jinzhou-Fuzhou Line (Jinfu Road): Starting from Jinzhou and ending in Chengzitun, a total length of 63.4 miles. Construction started in May of the Republic Year 15 and was completed in September of the Republic Year 16. It was financed by loans from the South Manchuria Railway of 559,000 yuan. It was built by Chinese and Japanese people.</p>
<p>(6) Tumen-Tieli Road (Tiantu Road): Starting from Difang to Laotougou and from Chaoyangchuan to Juzi Street, it is 69.0 miles long. Construction started in August of the Republic Year 11 and was completed in October of the Republic Year 13. It was jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese officials and merchants. This road is the eastern section of the Ji-Hui Railway and is of utmost importance. Originally, after the Japanese obtained the construction rights of the Ji-Hui Railway in the Tumen River Sino-Korean Boundary Affairs Treaty, they never stopped seeking its realization. However, due to the Chinese people's resolute opposition, there was no way out. After changing their strategy, they did not mention road construction, but instead mentioned mining. They did not use the name of the Japanese government, but the name of Japanese merchants. They did not ask the central government of our country, but asked the Jilin provincial authorities. They began laying tracks to confuse the eyes of the Chinese people. In the middle, there were many negotiations, and it was finally completed. The Japanese's intentions can be imagined. Recently, it was heard that the road has been purchased by the South Manchuria Railway, and negotiations have been completed. If this is true, then the southern section of the Ji-Hui Road has been realized. The situation is extremely critical. What will the Chinese people do?</p>
<p>(7) Benxi-Niuxintai Railway (XiYu Road): Starting from Benxi Lake and ending in Niuxintai, it is 14.7 miles long. Construction started in October of the Republic Year 2 and was completed in February of the Republic Year 3. It was jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese merchants. The purpose of the construction is specifically to transport the coal produced in Niuxintai.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned seven roads, totaling 763.8 miles long, are nominally jointly operated by China and Japan, or owned by our country, but in reality, the power has been lost and is controlled by others. We have no way to intervene. Based on the facts of the past, Japan generally holds two firm central policies on railway loans, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Monopoly on the railway loan rights in the southern part of the Three Eastern Provinces and Jehol. Oppose any third country investing and oppose China building railways with its own funds.</p>
<p>(2) Ensure that all railway loans are borrowed by the South Manchuria Railway Company.</p>
<p>The purpose of this type of railway loan is fourfold. (1) The roads built must be feeder lines for the South Manchuria Railway. (2) Earn interest. (3) Participate in monitoring or interfering with railway management. (4) Establish a hidden line for direct management in the future. The Japanese plan is like this. Learning from past mistakes, the Chinese people should seriously consider this in the future and never fall into their trap again.</p>
<h3 id="e64">(4) Businesses Operated by the South Manchuria Railway Company <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Company once stated in its published Manchuria textbook:</p>
<p>"This company bears the mission of developing Manchuria's economy and culture. It aims to develop the health and strength of our citizens (Japanese). It advocates the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity between the two countries (Japan and China) and operates various businesses. In South Manchuria, the emergence of a co-prosperity nation is clearly visible... In addition to the railway transport business, this company also engages in shipping, port management, mining, iron manufacturing, industry, and the development of Manchuria and Mongolia's industries. It also manages various land properties, buildings, artesian wells, and educational facilities within its jurisdiction, and conducts surveys. Although it is named a railway company, it is essentially an executive organ with the functions of a fully-equipped nation." | Manchuria Textbook 210 | 211 pages.</p>
<p>This statement, on the one hand, reveals the arrogance of the Japanese, who disregard our sovereignty and directly regard the development of our Northeast as their responsibility. On the other hand, it further reveals the insidious nature of their methods. They speak of co-prosperity, but in reality, they are developing the health and strength of their own citizens in the "new land of South Manchuria," plundering our treasures, and boasting of their merits in organizing, managing, and properly using them. How can the owner (China) reconcile this? The South Manchuria Railway Company's oppression of our Northeast is no different from the East India Company's oppression of India. It is directly the headquarters of Japan's invasion of our Northeast.</p>
<p>Let us examine the businesses operated by the South Manchuria Railway Company. Besides railway operation as the primary business (including warehouses and factories), it vigorously operates shipping, ports, mining, agriculture, iron manufacturing, electricity, and even hotels, as well as security, education, and surveys. Recently, it has further planned the expansion of iron manufacturing and the operation of oil shale oil production, ammonium sulfate chemical fertilizer, and caustic soda industries, among other major projects. Its influence has deeply penetrated our Northeast, and its roots are firmly established, planting the foundation for Japanese colonization. It is not only alarming but also deeply concerning. The businesses operated by the company are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Railways: The operation of railways has been briefly described above. As for railway ancillary businesses: (A) Warehouse operations. According to 1927 statistics, the incoming goods were 5.24 million tons, and the outgoing goods were 5.28 million tons. The average daily inventory was 340,000 tons. In addition to warehouses, it also provides insurance. (B) Factory operations. These include the Shahekou Factory, Liaoyang Factory, Sujiatun Wood Preservation Plant, and Dalian Electrical Repair Plant. Among them, the Shahekou Factory is the largest in scale, specializing in the manufacturing of locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars. Currently, there is a tramway between Shahekou and Dalian, which has become a small industrial city.</p>
<p>(2) Shipping: It began operating during the 33rd year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (1907). It has now been transferred to the Dalian Steamship Joint Stock Company and is no longer directly operated. However, the capital of 3 million yuan is entirely owned by the South Manchuria Railway Company. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Memorial Week for the Central Government and National Government <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Dai Jitao Reports on the Higher Examination Process</p>
<p>Yu Youren Reports on the Flood Disaster</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters, August 10, 9 a.m. The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for the Premier in the auditorium. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Chen Guofu, Zhu Peide, Ding Weifen, Fang Juehui, Chen Lifu, Yu Jingtang, Miao Peicheng, and staff from various departments and guests, totaling about 500 people, attended. Zhu Peide presided. After the ceremony, Dai Chuanxian reported that he was appointed as the chief examiner for the first Higher Examination. He felt inadequate and apprehensive. Fortunately, the examination committee members diligently and conscientiously performed their duties, striving to avoid errors. After more than ten days in confinement, all matters were completed. On the 9th, the examiners left the confinement simultaneously in the morning. All details of the examination were classified and statistically analyzed, and tables were prepared overnight for clarity. He would now briefly report on the key points: (1) Age: The oldest candidate was 44 years old, and the youngest was 21 years old, with an average age of 28 years and 8 and a half months, a promising age for accomplishment. (2) Native Place: Candidates who passed came from sixteen provinces. The provinces whose candidates did not pass included Shaanxi (8 candidates), Gansu (4), Ningxia and Mongolia (1 each), Rehe and Suiyuan (2 each), Heilongjiang (5), and Yunnan (12). This was due to the small number of candidates from those provinces. (3) Gender: Twenty-two women took the examination, but unfortunately, all failed. It was said that some were quite knowledgeable, which was regrettable. It was probably because women were physically weaker, and the hot weather and continuous rain for several days caused them mental and physical fatigue, preventing them from fully demonstrating their abilities. (4) Party Membership: Among the 43 candidates who passed the general administrative personnel examination, 18 were party members. (5) Qualifications: Ten of the 20 national universities that participated had candidates who passed. Out of 450 candidates, 37 passed. Three of the 18 public universities had candidates who passed. Out of 90 candidates, 3 passed. Two of the 32 private universities had candidates who passed. Out of 630 candidates, 20 passed. One student studying in the United States passed. (6) Experience: Calculated as a percentage, Central University accounted for 16%, Shanghai Jiaotong University 35%, Peking University 5%, Peiping University 4%, Peiping Normal University 23%, and Chaoyang University 3%. The average total score was above 60%. (7) Failures: 44% failed the second test but passed the first test, and 10% failed the first test but passed the second test. The above report was a summary; detailed information would be announced later. The speaker's thoughts on the examination results were: (1) We should strive to improve education to cultivate talent at the root. (2) University graduation examinations should be organized by the government to supplement the national examinations. (3) Examination laws and regulations should be carefully revised to improve academic standards. (4) Equal consideration should be given to examination systems for remote provinces and Mongolia. (5) The government should ensure that those who passed are used to their full potential and not left unused or misused. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>National Government. At 10 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held a memorial week for the Premier. Yu Youren, Ma Fuxiang, Li Shuhua, Lian Shenghai, He Yaozu, Liu Ruiheng, Zhu Lihe, Lin Xiang, Ru Yuli, Gao Weiyue, Zheng Hongnian, Zhang Wohua, Chen Shaokuan, and more than 100 staff from the National Government's civil affairs, military affairs, and accounting departments attended. Yu Youren presided. After the ceremony, Yu reported on the flood disaster, saying: "The sages said, 'Yu thought that if there was someone drowning in the world, it was as if he himself were drowning; Ji thought that if there was someone starving in the world, it was as if he himself were starving.' I report on the flood disaster today with this as the theme. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been many days of heavy rain, and rivers have overflowed. Many cities, towns, and villages have been submerged. The southern and northern provinces and most of the northern regions have become disaster areas. The losses are the worst in decades. The government recognizes this flood disaster as the greatest hidden danger and as something that must be actively addressed. Therefore, it has ordered all provinces to investigate the disaster situation and find ways to provide relief. At the same time, the government believes that the severity of this disaster and the government's failure to plan for flood prevention earlier are reasons for deep self-reproach. However, after this major disaster, the wealthy in various places often take the opportunity to profit, increasing social inequality. Moreover, the disturbances caused by the Red bandits are particularly worrying. Therefore, the government, whether in terms of responsibility or humanitarian sympathy, should be as concerned about the hungry and drowning as Yu and Ji, and strive to provide relief. The society should also fully assist the government and work together to find solutions to overcome the difficulties. At this time, all government colleagues should examine their work and living conditions to see if they are following the Premier's teachings and fulfilling their responsibilities. Only in this way can we face the suffering compatriots. We hope that every organ, every province and county, and every village will have people who are as concerned as Yu and Ji, and not treat this great disaster as something that does not concern them. Then, this great crisis can be overcome." After the report, the ceremony concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Shi Yousan's Resignation Telegram <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Sent from Dezhou on the 8th</p>
<p>Jinan dispatch: After Shi Yousan's defeat, his troops arrived in Dezhou and were reorganized by Han Fuju. However, there is no confirmed report on Shi Yousan's whereabouts. Today, the military and political organs here received Shi's resignation telegram from Dezhou. The original text is as follows: "To all military and political organs, schools, legal entities, newspapers, and all elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots throughout the country, Shi Yousan, a humble military man, has served in the army. He dares not claim to be behind others in his heart of saving the country and its people. Therefore, since the Xinhai Revolution, he has participated in almost all domestic wars. Over the past twenty years, politics has become increasingly chaotic, and the powers have increasingly invaded. Those who occupy important positions only know how to seize profits and fight for power, completely disregarding the country's difficulties and the people's hardships. As a result, the vast land of China is about to be destroyed. Yousan, as a soldier, has a responsibility to defend the country and protect the people. Therefore, he has vowed to base his actions on conscience and strive to fight, even at the cost of life and limb, without fear. The past events are all there and can be reviewed. This humble sincerity should be appreciated by the people of the country. Now that his heart is tired and his strength is exhausted, if he were to prolong the war, he would only retire to await the country's worthy men to work together for a good outcome. All of Yousan's troops have been handed over to the two division commanders, Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe, to be commanded separately and to join Commander-in-Chief Han Fuju. Since Commander-in-Chief Han and Yousan have shared hardships in the past, entrusting them to his command should prevent any disturbances. Yousan has no regrets in retiring from the military. In his parting words, he cannot express his feelings fully. Whether the country knows him or blames him, it is up to the people. Shi Yousan Qi." (9th)</p>

<p>Nanchang dispatch: According to the information released by the Political Training Office of the General Headquarters, the Guangdong-Guangxi invasion plan is divided into four routes. The Guangxi army is concentrated in Quanzhou and Lingsheng. One route advances along the Xiang River from Yongzhou to attack Hengzhou, and the other route advances along the Zi River from Wugang to seize Baoqing. The main force of the Guangdong army is concentrated in Shaoguan, and advances along the Yuehan Railway from Lechang to take Yongxing and Laiyang. Another force advances from Longhuguan into Yongming and Jianghua to spy on Changning. The above four routes focus entirely on the Yuehan Railway and the Xiang River, hoping to join forces in Hengbao in the shortest possible time. The General Headquarters also announced the telegram from the scout in Quanzhou, stating that Chen's rebel army, with fifteen regiments, is advancing towards Longhuguan, and Li's rebel army is advancing towards Lingsheng with twenty regiments. A report from Changsha also stated, "The Xiang-Gui rebel armies have plans to invade Xiang en masse. Li Yangjing has arrived in Lechang. Yan Bogang, a bandit on the Xiang-Yue border, has also been recruited by the Yue army and appointed as the vanguard to disturb Yizhang. Li Pinxian and Qin Yuanfang will soon enter Yong from Quan. Xiang Hanping's troops have also arrived at the Xiang border from Shao. The atmosphere in the counties of southern Xiang is tense. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has ordered all armies and He Jian to strictly guard against them." (August 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Higher Examination Unveiling Ceremony Held <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Lists of Successful Candidates Posted in Front of the Examination Yuan on the 9th</p>
<p>Most Successful Candidates Around 27 or 28 Years Old</p>
<p>Twenty Female Candidates, All Failed</p>
<p>President Dai Expresses Satisfaction with the Results</p>
<p>Beijing News: The various stages of the Higher Examination have been completed in order. The list of successful candidates was first drafted by the Examination Committee. The unveiling ceremony was held on the morning of the 9th. At 9 a.m., Shao Yuanchong, director of the Examination Assistance Office, Wang Yongbin, deputy director, and the supervisory committee members went to the Examination Committee at Nanjing Middle School, Bafutang. Shao Yuanchong personally opened the door, and they entered together to meet the Chief Examiner Dai and the committee members, talking for about ten minutes. Then, they went out together and drove to the Examination Yuan. The car in the lead was decorated with paper flowers, and "Seeking Talents for the Country" was written in front of the car. The list of successful candidates was stored inside, escorted by the two secretaries-general, Chen Daqi and Shen Shiyuan. When the car arrived in front of the Examination Yuan, firecrackers were set off, and military music played. The list was taken out and posted in front of the gate, surrounded by cloth railings, and guarded by police officers to show seriousness. The examination committee members successively entered the reception room of the president's office to rest. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, were waiting in the Yuan and expressed their condolences to Chief Examiner Dai. On this day, Dai wore a blue gauze long gown and a black mandarin jacket. Reporters asked him about his impressions of the Higher Examination. Dai said that the results were satisfactory, thanks to the efforts of the examination committee members, and he was very pleased. However, the examiners were concerned about two things beforehand: one was the province of origin of the successful candidates, and the other was their age. According to the statistics, successful candidates came from sixteen provinces, and the other provinces failed because there were too few candidates. For example, Shanxi had only eight people, Yunnan two, Guangxi five, Gansu two, and Mongolia two. Also, it was inappropriate for the age of the successful candidates to be too old or too young. The average age of the successful candidates this time was around 27 or 28 years old, which was quite appropriate. However, twenty female candidates took the examination, and twelve completed it. It was heard that two of them had a very solid academic foundation. It was initially thought that one or two would pass, but when the list was announced, all the women failed. It was thought that their physical strength and mental energy were not as good as men's, which was regrettable. Dai said at the end that more than twenty kinds of statistical tables in the examination had been ordered to be prepared overnight by the responsible personnel and would be announced by the Examination Assistance Office tomorrow. The efforts of all the staff members in the examination to work hard for the public despite the hot weather were especially commendable. The list of successful candidates in the five types of examinations is recorded below:</p>
<p>The highest-ranked candidate in the Higher Examination for General Administrative Personnel was Zhu Leizhang (Jiangsu). The three excellent candidates were Xia Fanqin (Jiangxi), Ran Peng (Hunan), and Fang Yang (Zhejiang).

<h3 id="e69">Wuhan Water Levels Rising <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Wuhan Dikes Continue to Breach</p>
<p>He Chengjun Will Impeach Himself to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Association is Also Planning Post-Disaster Relief for Various Counties</p>
<p>Hankou communication on the 7th. In Hankou, the city area has been flooded for a week. On the evening of the 6th, there was a heavy downpour, which cleared only on the afternoon of the 7th. The water level rose sharply by more than five inches. Telegrams from Hunan, Chongqing, and Xiangyang successively stated that there was still a water head of more than ten feet or several feet about to reach Hankou, causing panic among the refugees. Even the government authorities were alarmed and at a loss. The dangerous works on the dikes, such as Qiaokou and Huangjingtang in Hankou, the Saihu Dike and Xujiapeng in Wuchang, and the Wutai and Wufeng sluices, have been repaired day and night by Supervisor Xu Yuanquan, Commander Xia Douyin, Director of Water Conservancy Bureau Chen Keming, Mayor of Hankou He Baohua, and Director of Construction Department Fang Dazhi. The dikes have been heightened and thickened. The Saihu Dike is the most dangerous, but it may be safe if the water does not continue to rise. It was originally planned to spend 50,000 yuan to build a dike to drain the accumulated water in Hankou. Construction began on the 7th. The first step is to build a dike starting from Minquan Road, eastward to Jiaotong Road, turning to Yiyuan to Jianghanguan, directly reaching the French Concession. The second step is from the Model District to the railway side, turning to Xunlimen, passing through Laopu, Renshouli, Guanzhongli, Lianbaoli, and Xinhua Company, turning to Laolianbaoli, to reach the Sanchangjie entrance of the Chamber of Commerce, and ending at Minquan Road. First, a soil dike will be built for drainage. The third step will be to continue the drainage. The accumulated water within the area from the Municipal Government to the railway side is scheduled to be completed in five days and will be the responsibility of the Emergency Relief Association. Many refugees have been taken in in recent days. A portion of the refugees along the railway live on the railway embankment, exposed to the scorching sun and rain. The hot and humid conditions have caused many to contract seasonal diseases. In addition to sending doctors to provide medicine, the Association has ordered the refugees to move quickly. Since the refugees are reluctant to leave because they have no place to store their belongings, the Association has specially borrowed the address of the Gongxing Storage and Transportation Company near the railway as a place to store and keep them. At the same time, since the relief funds are too small to be distributed, it has telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, ordering the Pinghan Railway Bureau to add a 5% surcharge to its total revenue for Hubei flood relief for six months, expecting to collect 600,000 yuan to subsidize the civilian food supply. It has also telegraphed various places to relax the ban on grain, and Shanghai and Jiangxi have replied that a large amount of grain will be shipped, which may provide temporary support. According to historical records, this flood is unprecedented. The current Director of the Hubei Water Conservancy Bureau, Chen Keming, the Mayor of Hankou, He Baohua, and the Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, Huang Zhenxing, are all responsible. Although Chen and others are trying to shirk their responsibilities, the people have deep resentment. It is not enough to quell public anger without strict investigation. The Provincial and Municipal Party Departments have held several meetings to discuss the matter in detail and will have a very serious response in the coming days. He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters and Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, is also thoroughly investigating and has reportedly told people that he will impeach himself to the central government.</p>
<p>Hankou communication on the 8th. The water level in Wuhan continues to rise unabated in recent days. According to a telegram from Xiangyang, there is still a water head of 1.6 zhang (approximately 5.3 meters) flowing down the river, causing extreme panic among the people. Flood prevention work has become even more tense. The dikes in the Hankou area, especially the Huangjingtang, Pizijie, and Qiaokou areas, are the most dangerous. The Flood Prevention Office has instructed the Mayor of Hankou, He Baohua, to take charge of the rescue, heightening and thickening the dikes to prevent the Xiang water from continuing to arrive. Sirens will be sounded at night to warn residents to prepare. As of the morning of the 9th, the dike had fortunately not breached. However, one-third of the Donghuajiao Dike under Saijiashan was washed away. The Water Conservancy Bureau and the Municipal Government jointly rescued it. Although there was a small breach, it was immediately blocked, preventing a disaster. As for the breaches in the Jiazhaoji Danshui Pond area, the Flood Prevention Office has sent workers to repair them, and they are generally in order. They will be completed in three to five days. Regarding the drainage of accumulated water, it is also being actively carried out. The street entrances around Hankou City have been temporarily dammed with yellow pine cement, and drainage will begin immediately. However, it is unknown whether the river surface, which is already higher than the banks, can accommodate the huge amount of water. In addition to Wuhan, more than fifty counties in the province have been affected by the flood. There are also some that have not been reported due to poor postal and telecommunications. Refugees are flocking to Hankou, filling every available space. The Emergency Relief Association has telegraphed various places to temporarily prevent refugees from entering the city and has ordered the county magistrates to work with local organizations, just gentry, and citizens to establish emergency relief offices within ten days of receiving the notice to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Flood Losses in Five Provinces <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Exceeds 2 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing (Central News Agency) - Continuous rainfall since early July, lasting for approximately four weeks, has caused a major flood in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the worst in sixty-one years. Rice paddies have been completely washed away, and land transportation to various cities along the river has been almost entirely cut off, relying only on sampans and rowboats to barely maintain traffic. The Yangtze River, one of the world's three major rivers, naturally has a massive volume of water flowing into the sea at all times. However, it is difficult to predict when the accumulated floodwaters in various locations can be expected to recede. The extensive area affected by this flood and the rapid rise of the waters have resulted in significant losses of livestock and human lives. While the exact figures of the current losses are still unclear, a synthesis of various sources indicates that the magnitude is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Province   Flood Area  Affected Population  Affected Cultivated Land Area  Number of Severely Affected Counties</p>
<p>(Square Miles) (Thousands) (Thousands of Mu)</p>
<p>Hubei      18,000        9,000                 7,200                         30</p>

<p>The total number of affected households is approximately 4.5 million, totaling 23 million people. About 10,000 houses have collapsed, and the death toll is in the thousands. The most severe cases include instances in Hubei Province where breaches in the dikes led to entire villages being submerged overnight, resulting in the drowning of most villagers. The area of affected cultivated land accounts for approximately 12% of the total cultivated land area in the country. The areas along the Yangtze River are primarily the best farmlands, so the impact on harvests will exceed 20% of the national harvest. According to elders, it will take at least a year for the current accumulated water to recede. Experts also believe that the water may not completely recede even by the winter's lowest water level. In short, most of this year's autumn harvest is hopeless. In addition, the total direct and indirect losses from agricultural losses, submerged grain storage, and the stagnation of local industries will exceed 2 billion yuan. The National Government plans to issue 10 to 20 million yuan in flood relief bonds to provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Tragic Scenes of the Great Flood in Xubu <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Water Depth Exceeds Four Feet on Level Ground in the City</p>
<p>The Old Course of the Yellow River Rises Again After Rain</p>
<p>Xuzhou Quick Report: Xubu experienced heavy rains last month. The waters of the old course of the Yellow River have risen again due to heavy rainfall upstream, turning the entire town into a swamp. After several days of sunny weather, the water level had dropped. Unexpectedly, one evening, there was a sudden torrential rain that lasted all night. The water flow from the upper reaches of the old course of the Yellow River became even stronger, causing Xubu to return to its original state. Since the first day, the weather has not cleared, with heavy rain falling intermittently. In the lower parts of the city, the water depth reaches the knees. Reports of collapsed houses and deaths have been heard from time to time. As of the 5th, according to a survey by the Construction Bureau, over 160 houses have collapsed, and more than ten people have been killed or injured. The water level in the old course of the Yellow River is only two feet below the bridge deck. On the morning of the 7th, the water from the upper reaches of the old course of the Yellow River suddenly surged down with great force, rising by two feet, causing extreme panic. Unexpectedly, at one o'clock in the afternoon, torrential rain resumed, pouring down for about two hours. The water depth in the level ground of the city reached four feet, and houses in the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast corners were completely submerged. Household furniture floated around, traffic was blocked, and floodwaters overflowed. People supporting their wives and carrying their children flocked to higher ground, passing through Zhongshan and Datong Streets, which were free of water, causing congestion. At the same time, the water in the old course of the Yellow River also increased by about a foot. Four arches of the river bridge outside the North Gate were washed away by the rapid current. The Beimalu Bridge outside the East Gate and the Nanmalu Bridge outside the South Gate remain undamaged. However, the Xubu city walls were demolished by the First Division stationed in Xuzhou in 1928. Later, the Education Bureau sold the foundation of the city walls and built houses, completely destroying the city walls. This spring, the embankment of the old course of the Yellow River outside the city was purchased from the Government Property Bureau by the Jiudetang and dismantled, causing the river to overflow and potentially flood the city. The river embankment outside the Xiaobeimen in the northwest of the city has gradually deteriorated over the years, and the terrain is low. River water has flooded outside the gate. The County Government, Construction Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and the First District Office, along with the public, worked overnight to reinforce the embankment and divert the water eastward by digging open a section of the long-distance road from the North Gate to Jiulishan, providing temporary relief. However, the Hexiang mine outside the East Gate was suddenly subjected to a large amount of water from the north, causing waves to surge. The water passed over the East Bridge, damaging one arch of the West End of the South Bridge on the morning of the 8th. The nearby residents gathered at the West End of the river bridge to dig a channel to discharge the water. Although water could be discharged between the North and South bridges, the area near the Huoshen Temple and the Jijui Dam downstream was breached. County and city officials Yang Wei, Qiao Jianming, Liu Zhongxin, Zhu Zhengxue, as well as the heads of various branch bureaus and township chiefs, all supervised the public to repair the breaches at the Huoshen Temple and Jijui Dam. The floodwaters were finally blocked by the afternoon. Over the past two days, approximately 5,000 large and small burlap sacks and rush mats were used in various locations, and four to five thousand people worked with shovels and hoes, united in their efforts to prevent further damage. Fortunately, they were able to preserve the city. However, many of the electric poles in Xubu were also knocked down during the heavy rain. The director of the Telegraph Bureau, Kuang Jingyou, supervised the repair work overnight, ensuring that all four lines were fully operational. This reporter waded through the water this morning to inspect the various locations, which are still being reinforced. The people living along the river are gathered and squatting on the sides of roads and riverbanks, looking extremely miserable. Mr. Guo Hanping, the director of the Xuzhou Xinguang Photography Studio, accompanied by technician Zhu Weinan, inspected and photographed with the reporter team in the rain. It is hoped that kind-hearted people will see this tragic situation and generously provide relief. This is a prayer on behalf of the disaster-stricken people of Xubu. As for the government, the county government reported the disaster to the province on the 6th. The Construction Bureau dispatched technicians to inspect the water situation, measure it daily, and dredge river channels and water gates to provide relief. After the sudden wind and rain on the afternoon of the 7th, while sending people to reinforce the embankment, the county government convened an emergency meeting with representatives from various agencies. County Magistrate Yang Wei presided over the meeting and resolved to (1) organize a Tongshan County Flood Relief Committee; (2) establish an office at the Liquidation Office, which was established immediately; (3) appoint representatives from the county party headquarters, county government, Public Security Bureau, Construction Bureau, Education Bureau, First District Office, Relief Institute, Liquidation Office, Education Association, First and Second District Party Headquarters, Chamber of Commerce, Journalists' Association, Wanzihui, and Farmers' Association as members; (4) mortgage the rice mill to the Bank of China for 10,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. On the afternoon of the 8th, County Magistrate Yang Wei convened a second emergency meeting with representatives from various sectors, deciding to (1) send Li Fengru, Lan Bohua,</p>

<h3 id="e75">Detailed Report on the Suppression of the Red Army and the Recovery of Xingguo <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>20,000 Bandits Killed, 15,000 Captured</p>
<p>Chiang Awards Meritorious Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Battle of Xingguo was the last struggle of the Red Bandits, and it was also the last bloody battle between the Red Bandits and the Suppression Army. Recently, the General Headquarters received a detailed report from the Forward General Headquarters and the Right Wing Commander Chen regarding the progress of the battle. The general gist is: "Last month, Xiang Ying and other bandit groups, numbering tens of thousands, who had fled from Guangchang, Lichuan, and Shicheng in Fujian, planned to return to their old base in southern Jiangxi while our army was attacking Donggu and Ningdu. At that time, our army went straight in and captured Shicheng, cutting off the connection between the Red Bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi. Therefore, there were still about 20,000 bandits hiding in the Ninghua, Tinghang area. As our army successively broke through the bandit nests in various places, the bandits in Fujian detoured through Ruijin and gathered in Xingguo, uniting with scattered bandits who had no nests to return to, numbering no fewer than 30 to 40 thousand. They built solid fortifications in Xingguo, hoping for a final struggle. Our Right Wing Army took advantage of the victory to point south. The 19th Route Army of the First Group attacked Shacun from the southwest of Donggu via Tongqiu, Tianfu, and Wanshi Ridge. Chen Cheng's troops attacked Gupingxu from Zhangzhuang and Caoxi. Zhao Guantao attacked Xingguo City from Quyang Jiecunxu. At the same time, a part of the Left Wing Army came out diagonally from Longkou and Taoxi, heavily surrounding the bandits and launching a joint attack from different directions. Starting on the 30th of last month, a general offensive was launched. Since the bandit army had no way to escape, they had to fight like trapped beasts. Our army advanced step by step, encircling the bandits in the area of Xingguo and Gaoxingxu. Then, the air force was concentrated to bombard them as much as possible. From July 30th to August 4th, over six days, a total of more than 500 120-pound and 160-pound bombs were dropped. The casualties among the bandits were countless. One regiment (the 32nd Regiment) of our Zhao Army bravely advanced directly on the night of the 3rd. By dawn on the 4th, they had forced their way into Xingguo County, fighting fiercely with the bandits on all sides for half a day. As our armies successively arrived, the bandits retreated into the city, closed the city, and defended it firmly. After being bombarded by our air force and artillery for several hours, the city was breached at about 4 o'clock. The officers and soldiers of the regiment swarmed in, fighting the bandits in the streets for several hours, leaving a bloody mess piled up in the streets. Thereupon, the bandits surrendered one after another, and none escaped. It is estimated that about 20,000 bandits were killed in this battle, and more than 15,000 were captured alive. The strength of the bandit forces has been almost completely wiped out. The burying of the bandits' corpses, from the branches to the fish, has not yet been completed." After receiving the telegram, Chiang, in addition to ordering the Ganzhou Party and Government Branch to quickly handle the aftermath, also telegraphed Commander Zhao to quickly restore order and offer condolences to the victims. As for the 32nd Regiment, he sent a telegram commending them and ordering that they be given the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, to be filled as soon as a vacancy arises. In addition, Chiang, with the great merit of suppressing the Red Bandits about to be accomplished, yesterday specially telegraphed He Yingqin and Chen Mingshu to investigate and report the officers and soldiers who had made meritorious contributions, so as to award them. From this, it can be seen that the military campaign to suppress the bandits will soon come to an end. (August 7)</p>
<p>Yangzi Bridge, Jiangdu</p>
<h3 id="e76">Villagers Burn Water Conservancy Bureau's Official Boat <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>And Beat Up the Committee Members and Crew</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Bureau's Official Documents Also Burned</p>
<p>The Zhufang, a ship stationed at the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, was intercepted by local people in Yangzi Bridge, Jiangdu County, when it was returning to the province from Gaoyou the day before yesterday (the 8th). The members of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Ouyang Ming, and the crew were beaten up. The ship was dragged to the opposite side of the Gaomin Temple, and burned with kerosene and firewood. In addition, six boxes of official documents from the Gaoyou Water Conservancy Bureau over the years were burned and destroyed. In addition to those who were injured, several government officials and crew members are missing. The Construction Department's Water Conservancy Bureau and the Shipping Association have sent people to Jiangdu County to investigate. The details of the incident are listed below:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident: Over the years, when the Grand Canal's water level rises, the Yangzi Bridge water mark exceeds 12 feet 4 inches, the boats between Guazhou and Yangzi Bridge must be towed and stop. When steamers happen to pass by, a small number of busybodies gather people under the pretext of protecting the dam and detain the boats to pursue their own interests. According to people in the shipping industry, disputes have occurred frequently in recent years. For example, in 1929, the Fengshun and Hengtong were detained in Yangzi Bridge, and the crew members were beaten and the objects were damaged. In 1930, the Henggui and Yuanchang were detained in Liuqian, and they were allowed to leave only after mediation. Last month, the Jiangsu and Fengshun were detained again in Yangzi Bridge. They were only released after the township head and deputy set conditions. It can be seen from this that the local people have malicious behaviors toward merchant ships and official boats passing by.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Trip: The Zhufang small steamer was funded by the Zhenjiang Fuhua Company and purchased from the Lisu Company for use by the Shipping Affairs Office. This trip was made after the Water Conservancy Bureau sent a letter to the Shipping Association requesting a loan from the Office. On the 6th, more than 7,000 burlap sacks were loaded, and at dawn on the 7th, they set off to Gaoyou to provide emergency damming work. On the 8th, Ouyang Ming, a technician from the Water Conservancy Bureau, was sent back to the province to report on the water situation and the dike project, with six boxes of documents attached. They set off southward at 2 PM.</p>
<p>Beating People and Burning Boats: At about 6 PM that afternoon, when the Zhufang steamer was passing the north end of Yangzi Bridge, Jiangdu County, someone beat a gong to gather people and shouted for the boat to stop. The helmsman heard the sound and dared not move forward. The rioters then boarded several boats and crossed the center of the river. Some people dove into the water and rushed onto the Zhufang steamer to smash objects and beat people indiscriminately. At that time, Committee Member Ouyang held up the official documents and stated that this boat was an official boat for the Water Conservancy Bureau. The rioters not only ignored him, but also kidnapped and took Committee Member Ouyang, the captain, and the boatmen ashore, and beat them severely. They then let the Zhufang steamer drift to the opposite side of Gaomin Temple, poured kerosene on the boat, and then burned it with reeds until the boat sank to the bottom of the water. Only a few inches of the chimney were visible on the water surface.</p>
<p>Injuries: Ouyang Ming, a technician from the Engineering Department of the Water Conservancy Bureau, was originally a weak scholar. After being beaten, he had many wounds all over his body, and the blood on his arm was blurred. He was unconscious for a long time during the beating before waking up. He was then detained at the local sub-station. At 9 PM that night, he was sent to the Dandu County government. Captain Zou Hanquan of the boat was also beaten. The apprentice Xiao Cunzi and others were treated at the Provincial Hospital. Other injuries, both minor and severe, have not yet been investigated thoroughly.</p>
<p>Shipping Association Report: Jiang Zaishan, the old purser of the Zhufang, escaped back to the office and reported the situation. Then, the Zhenjiang Shipping Association telegraphed the Water Conservancy Bureau on his behalf. The telegram read: "To the Director and other members of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau: According to a telegram from the Shipping Affairs Office, Jiang Zaishan, the purser of the Zhufang, reported this morning that the Zhufang small steamer was rented by the Water Conservancy Bureau through the Shipping Affairs Office on the 6th, loaded with more than 7,000 burlap sacks, and sent to Gaoyou to provide emergency damming work, flying the flag of the Water Conservancy Bureau. The boat left Zhenjiang at dawn on the 7th and returned to the province at the request of Committee Member Ouyang of the Water Conservancy Bureau after completing the public affairs in Gaoyou. At about 1 PM on the 8th, it set off southward. At 6 PM, when passing Yangzi Bridge, someone beat a gong to gather people and shouted for the boat to stop. The helmsman heard the sound and docked the boat. When Mr. Ouyang held up the official documents and stated that it was the official boat of the Water Conservancy Bureau, three or four people suddenly shouted and started beating. Then, a large number of people swarmed onto the boat, beating the committee member and the crew. They then went ashore and tied up many people, and then let the boat drift to the opposite side of Gaomin Temple, where they burned the boat completely with kerosene and rice straw until it sank in the water. There were also six boxes of documents from the Water Conservancy Bureau in the boat, which were burned as well. Zaishan and others fled into the water in a hurry. Xiao Sanzi, Gu Xueyi, and Xie Yongshi were injured, and Zaishan, Zhu Taozi, and Chen Mazi escaped. The remaining crew members, Captain Zou Hanquan, Second Mate Xu Xiaolin, sailor Xiao Liu, cook Xiao Heshang, and apprentice Xiao Cunzi, are currently missing. Therefore, in addition to sending the injured to the Provincial Hospital for treatment, we will submit a further report on the details. We hereby send a telegram in advance, and we pray that the honorable office will quickly send people to the site to investigate with the personnel of our association and the office staff so that relief can be handled.</p>

<p>Tragic Accident of House Collapse at Zhongdong Theater: The Zhongdong Theater outside Guangfu Gate was funded by local people such as Xu Guofeng and Yao Ganshi. The house was contracted by a Guo from Jiangyin, and the workmanship and materials were shoddy. The Construction Bureau ordered improvements, but they were able to dredge it and start drumming peacefully. At first, they screened movies, and then changed to southern opera. At about 9 PM the other night, when Chen Cai'e was singing the second act of The Pearl Pagoda when the neighbor Wang's house (ie, the house of Caiyun, the famous Zhuangzhu of Hanzhuang, which was destroyed by fire a few months ago) suddenly collapsed. At the same time, six frames of the Zhongdong house also collapsed, and the viewers who were close to it were pressed inside. For a time, calling men to find women, losing earrings and shoes, I don't know how many. As a result, forty people were sent to the hospital, including Wang Arong, Ni Jingen, Du Zhu, and Du Qizhen, a six-year-old girl, who were seriously injured and their lives were in danger. When the accident happened, the order was chaotic, and the traffic was blocked one after another.

<p>China's First Tennis Book</p>
<p>Published by Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore</p>
<p>Essential Reading for Tennis Lovers</p>
<p>In recent years, the sport of tennis has become extremely popular among Chinese people. Tennis competitions have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and the sound of tennis matches is constantly heard. This is a very good phenomenon, as tennis is suitable for people of all ages, regardless of gender, and there is no seasonal restriction. It is beneficial to health and is a very beneficial sport. However, although there are many enthusiasts and diligent practitioners, progress in technique is difficult to achieve due to a lack of learning methods and good guidance. This is a great regret. Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore, in view of this, and with the aim of promoting sports and making up for the above-mentioned shortcomings, has recently invited Ma Detai, the former tennis instructor of the National Games, to write the book "Tennis Training Method." The content is excellent and complete, divided into ten chapters: Chapter 1: Introduction; Chapter 2: Grip Method; Chapter 3: Hitting Method; Chapter 4: Singles Competition Method; Chapter 5: Doubles Competition Method; Chapter 6: Key Points During Competition; Chapter 7: Attitude During Competition; Chapter 8: Key Points During Player Training; Chapter 9: On-Court Strategy; Chapter 10: Secrets to Winning. The entire book provides detailed and clear instructions on tennis hitting techniques, training methods, etc., without leaving anything unsaid. Each chapter also includes correct posture demonstrations, with photos taken by tennis players Yu Tianguang and others, printed on high-quality copperplate paper, which are exceptionally clear. The special feature of this book is that it integrates the strengths of Europe and the United States, takes into account the situation in China, and is written as a special book suitable for Chinese training, which is commendable. The author, Mr. Ma, has served as the instructor of the Chinese tennis team at the 7th, 8th, and 9th Far Eastern Games, so he has rich experience in tennis and has his own unique insights. His writings are based on scientific methods as the basis for training. Therefore, this book is the most suitable tennis book for China and should be the first tennis book in the country. It is a new contribution to the sports world. The hardcover book is priced at five jiao, with a special price of nine discounts, four jiao and five fen, and postage of eight fen.

<h3 id="e118">Typhoon Warning in Shanghai <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>All Sea Vessels Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the impending typhoon in Shanghai, the Observatory and the Jianghai Customs fired cannons after 4:00 PM to notify all shipping companies to take precautions, resulting in the complete suspension of coastal shipping. Details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Observatory Issues Warning The Xujiahui Observatory issued a special alert yesterday at 11:00 AM, stating that the typhoon had clearly spread to northern Zhejiang and the Ningbo area, with severe cyclones in the Ma'anshan area. It is reported that the wind is coming from 123 degrees east longitude and 27 degrees north latitude, proceeding northwest-west from the islands south of Ryukyu. Yesterday morning, the typhoon passed over the Wenzhou waters with strong force, and there were also heavy rains. A reporter met with Mr. Wang, a Chinese maritime expert, who said that he had observed the weather and climate, and if the wind direction remained unchanged, it was expected to reach Shanghai around 1:00 AM this morning. Mr. Wang also said that the slight rain yesterday afternoon was a forecast of the approaching typhoon. Mr. Wang has been the owner of ocean-going vessels for more than ten years, and his words seem credible.</p>
<p>Warning Ball and Cannons Sounded Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a large black warning ball was raised high on the climate platform of the Observatory at the eastern end of Avenue Edward VII along the Huangpu River, and multiple wind warning signals were hung on both sides to notify commercial vessels sailing on the river. At 4:35 PM, the Jianghai Customs' flag platform at Lujiazui in Pudong also raised a large black warning ball on the top of the platform, and simultaneously fired a warning cannon to alert the shipping community to take precautions in advance. Barges, small boats, sampans, ferries, and other vessels in the Huangpu River immediately berthed at the docks or sailed into the inner harbor to prevent capsizing.</p>
<p>Ningbo Ships Suspended Around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, China Merchants Sanbei received telegrams from the Ningbo Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing vessels, stating that they were unable to depart from Ningbo due to typhoon avoidance and were currently staying in Ningbo. In addition, Taikoo's Xin Beijing, Ningshao, and Xin Ningshao were scheduled to depart for Ningbo yesterday. After receiving warnings from the Observatory and the Customs, they announced the suspension of one sailing and issued a notice to reschedule the departure for tomorrow. Passengers who had already boarded the ships received refunds and disembarked one after another, returning to their respective destinations.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Ships Sheltering From Wind The Shanghai-Taiwan and Wenzhou-bound vessels, including the Zhoushan, were also temporarily suspended yesterday, and the announcement was extended for one day. The China Merchants Bureau's Wenzhou-bound vessel Jiahe, which departed from Shanghai the day before yesterday, encountered strong winds before reaching Wenzhou. According to a telegram from the vessel yesterday, it had temporarily stopped in the middle of the journey to avoid the wind and was not in danger.</p>
<p>Coastal Vessels Delayed All coastal commercial vessels scheduled to depart this morning, such as Taikoo's Xinjiang and Yichang, were bound for Nanhua ports in Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong, which are on the inevitable path of the typhoon. Yesterday, the company had already extended the departure date of each vessel by one day. Those that had already departed were notified by the vessel bureaus via radio to anchor at the Wusongkou to temporarily avoid going out to sea to avoid danger. Vessels entering the port, on the other hand, were expedited to sail into the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Small Boats in the Huangpu River Take Precautions Yesterday afternoon from 5:00 PM, cargo barges, ferries, and other small boats on the Huangpu River had already suspended operations early. Private boats that had unloaded their cargo at the docks sailed into the Suzhou Creek to take temporary shelter. Therefore, there were no ships sailing on the river in the evening. However, Yangtze River vessels, which do not pass through the sea route, still planned to depart.</p>
<h3 id="e119">City Party Headquarters Declaration <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Swiss Consul's Protection of Communists</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party declared: "The greatest disaster in our country at present is none other than the Red bandits, and the most important task in our country at present is none other than to eliminate the Red bandits. The scourge of the Red bandits is not only sufficient to overthrow our country's political system and destroy our country's society, but also sufficient to cut off the livelihood of our people, eliminate the population of our country, and endanger the survival of our race. The spread of the Red scourge in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places is already waning and gradually being eliminated, but its lurking in other places is still restless, plotting to make a move, and cannot be ignored by us. This city is located in a strategic location and has long been coveted by the Red bandits, especially with the concessions serving as a barrier for their actions. Therefore, most of the important members of the Red bandits are hiding here to plan their work of murder and arson. In early June of this year, the head of the Eastern Department of the Third International, the Russian couple Noulens, were hiding in the Public Concession and were uncovered by the police. The Noulens were arrested together, and hundreds of important pieces of evidence were seized, including plans to command the Red Army in combat and the use of poison gas, which were shocking to read. During the interrogation of the criminals, Noulens claimed to be Belgian, and his wife claimed to be French. Later, after inquiries were made by the authorities, it was found that everything was false. The current government sent a letter to the court requesting extradition. On the 7th of this month, the date of the court hearing, the court ruled that the crimes committed were entirely to disrupt the peace of the Chinese mainland, and the tragedies of the Red bandits' murder and arson were all instructed by Noulens. Moreover, the nationality he claimed had long been denied by Belgium, so the extradition was approved according to law. The Garrison Headquarters immediately sent personnel to take custody, but unexpectedly, the Swiss Consul suddenly sent a letter to the police, admitting that the criminal was a Swiss national and opposing the transfer. However, after investigation, the criminal claimed to be Belgian and then Swiss, which is contradictory and shows that his claim is false. Although the Swiss Consul admitted that the criminal was Swiss, the criminal had never registered in Switzerland, nor did he have a Swiss passport, nor did he have any evidence to prove his Swiss nationality. The evidence that he colluded with the criminal to protect the Communist Party is conclusive, and the responsibility lies with him. In addition to presenting a note to the central government to severely reprimand the Swiss Minister, we now issue a declaration on the course of events so that our citizens will know the absurdity of the Swiss Consul. He is indeed greedy for undue gain and is willing to act as a henchman for Red Russia, to slaughter the people of our China and destroy the organization of our Chinese society. His intention is absurd, and his actions are wrong, as well as the scourge of the concessions and consular jurisdiction, and we must think of ways to correct them. We hope that all citizens will rise up together, and it will be fortunate."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Swore Oaths Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>

<p>Original Text of the Oath The original text of the oath sworn by the presidents, etc., reads: "I solemnly swear that I will strictly abide by the teachings of the Premier, obey the party's righteousness, abide by the laws, and be loyal and diligent in my duties. I will never waste a penny or misuse a person, and I will never engage in embezzlement or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This oath."</p>

<p>Oath Supervisor's Speech First, Su Xixun, the representative of the Judicial Yuan and oath supervisor, gave a speech, stating: "Today, I am very honored and pleased to be here as a representative to participate in the oath-taking ceremony of the two presidents. The greatest goal of this recovery of the French Concession is, on the one hand, to implement the recovery of judicial power, and on the other hand, to complete the unification of judicial power. Now, through diplomatic efforts and the backing of the people, the abnormal organization that has hindered judicial power for eighty years has been abolished, and two local courts of the Republic of China have been established. The recovery of judicial power has been realized, and the unification of judicial power has been completed. However, the Judicial Yuan has two points to convey to you: (1) The two courts themselves, in the initial stage of their establishment, should consider all facilities, measures, and matters that should be promoted and reformed in a comprehensive manner to achieve perfection. However, at the beginning, it is inevitable that things will be slightly difficult, so you must carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages and be cautious in your actions to gradually improve and solve all difficulties. (2) To meet the wishes of the general public, you must have better results. The quality of the results depends on the degree of effort. For example, if the score is 100 points as the standard, if you can reach 90 points, then the results are excellent. If you do not reach half of the points, then you still need to work harder. I hope that all of you in the two courts will put in your best efforts and strive to make the future of the courts a very good one to show the spirit of the Republic of China's legislation. According to my personal feelings, the two presidents and all of you in the two courts are knowledgeable and experienced. In the future, you will definitely live up to the expectations of the government and the people, and I can congratulate you on your success in advance."</p>
<p>Party Representative's Speech Tong Xingbai, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, said: "Today, I am attending the oath-taking ceremony of the two courts, and at the same time, I am filled with a deep sense of sorrow in this very happy occasion. The land, the people, and sovereignty are the essential elements of the national spirit of any country. Why does our country have this unhealthy disease? Of course, it is because of the imperialists' seizure of power. At the same time, we should look back at the past suffering and work doubly hard. In the eyes of the general public, the oath seems to be completely a formality, but the Premier considered it to be the most important task at the time. Therefore, holding the oath is to implement one of the Premier's teachings, and the oath-takers should also take this as a warning and self-encouragement. There are still a few points that I would like to offer to you: (1) Law, judges must have a basis and responsibility. If you violate the oath, you will inevitably be held responsible. (2) Morality, judges should not only be held legally responsible but also pay attention to moral issues. I know that the judges of the two courts have always been highly regarded, and they will definitely have good results in the future. (3) In the past, the French Concession Court was unable to be rectified due to foreign constraints and diplomatic restraints. This kind of pain will definitely be reduced after the recovery, and all rectifications can be carried out. Although there may be accumulated problems that cannot be solved at once, all necessary reforms should be made as much as possible."</p>
<p>Guests' Speeches Wang Yansong, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said: "This time, the abolition of the French Concession Court and the establishment of the Chinese-style court is a cause for celebration. From now on, the residents of the French Concession will have the guarantee of the 'law.' The current judges are all knowledgeable and experienced, and with their integrity and impartiality, it is expected that the future results will be remarkable. The realization of the entire recovery of judicial power should be the starting point for this. This is not only the good fortune of the business community but also the common expectation of the people of the whole country." The rest is omitted.</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply Chairman Liang Renjie replied: "Today, we are honored that the Judicial Yuan, the Municipal Party Department, and representatives from all walks of life have come to supervise and guide us. All the members of the two courts are extremely honored. We will sincerely accept the instructions of all the representatives. We are all lacking in talent and shallow in learning. Since taking office, we have been cautious and fearful of making mistakes. From now on, we feel that the responsibility is even greater both internally and externally. We can only abide by the oath and uphold the three principles of integrity, prudence, and diligence and work hard. If there is anything inappropriate, we still hope that all walks of life will give us guidance."</p>
<p>After the Registration of Japanese Goods is Completed</p>
<h3 id="e123">Detailed Rules for Passage are Defined <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>

<p>Detailed Rules for Passage The committee has stipulated the following detailed rules for the registration of Japanese goods and the payment of money for the passage of goods that were detained for smuggling without following the public registration procedures: (1) The Japanese goods merchant must fill out three "registration forms" at the registration section. (2) After the registration section receives the registration form, it will distribute it as follows: (a) One copy will be kept for record; (b) One copy will be sent to the investigation section; (c) One copy will be sent to the secretariat. (3) When the registration section sends the above form to the investigation section, it must also attach a signed list of the personnel involved, which must be sealed by the director and staff of the registration section. (4) After the investigation section receives the two forms and one list sent by the registration section, it must immediately send personnel to investigate and fill out the "Registration Goods Investigation Report Form," sending one copy to the secretariat (along with the signed list of the personnel involved), one copy to the registration section, and keeping one copy for record. (5) After the secretariat receives the registration form, etc., from the registration section and the "Investigation Report Form" and "Signed List of Personnel Involved" from the investigation section, it must immediately fill out the "Notice of Payment of Relief Funds" and the "Notice of Withdrawal," notifying the merchant and simultaneously making a duplicate copy to notify the accounting department. If the investigation situation is inconsistent, the merchant should be notified to re-register. (6) After receiving the notice, the merchant should immediately deposit the money at the bank designated by the committee, obtain a receipt, and then go to the accounting department of the committee to verify the amount. If it is correct, the accounting department will stamp "Verified Correct" and return it to the secretariat, which will notify the registration section to issue a passage permit. (7) If the goods are in the possession of the committee, the secretariat should immediately notify the storage section to release them. These detailed rules specifically refer to detained goods. Those who come to the committee to request registration in accordance with the law and pay for the goods that were purchased before July 14 will not be charged, that is, they do not need to pay the money.</p>

(6) The investigation report form that has been filled out each day must be compiled and submitted to the director of the section for review.</p>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting The committee held its eighth Standing Committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, which was attended by committee members Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Tao Baichuan, and Hou Dachun.

<p>A New Discovery in the Treatment of Tuberculosis</p>
<h3 id="e125">Translated from the German Tuberculosis Sanatorium Magazine <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<h3 id="e126">What is the Tuberculosis Bacterium? <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The tubercle bacillus (i.e., tuberculosis bacterium) is a rod-shaped bacterium. Its body is straight or slightly curved. Its length is approximately one and a half millionths of a meter, which is invisible to the naked eye. According to a certain method, using skillful means, a stained specimen is prepared and examined under a microscope with a magnification of 600 to 1,000 times. Only then can it be seen. It is indeed an extremely small thing.</p>
<p>In ancient times, China called it the "consumption cough worm." Today, people all know that the tubercle bacillus is the worm of tuberculosis, but it does not belong to the animal kingdom. There are countless lower microorganisms existing around us, commonly known as minute organisms, which are invisible to the naked eye. These minute organisms are divided into two types: animal and plant. Those belonging to the animal type are called protozoa, and those belonging to the plant type are called molds. These lower plant molds belong to a family of cryptogams and have no chlorophyll. Molds are further divided into three types according to their shape and quality: "filamentous molds," "budding molds," and "fission molds."</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Colonial Policy of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The reproduction of fission molds is based on their own fission action, that is, changing from one to two, and from two to four, gradually increasing. Therefore, they are called fission molds. Humans and other animals often develop diseases because of them. Therefore, they are called "pathogenic bacteria." They are further divided into three types according to their different shapes: "spherical molds," "rod-shaped molds," and "spiral molds." The tuberculosis bacterium is a rod-shaped bacterium in the fission mold.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis bacteria are most abundant in the sputum of tuberculosis patients. They often increase or decrease depending on the severity of the patient's condition. According to Dr. Haekler of Cape Ray, Germany, a piece of sputum from a tuberculosis patient contains 300 million tubercle bacilli. Therefore, a person who coughs up sputum once per hour has 7.2 billion tubercle bacilli excreted from the body of the tuberculosis patient and spread into the air. People in the world are attacked by them day and night. But where do these many pathogenic bacteria come from? The main body of fission bacteria has a fission function, as mentioned above. They gradually increase and multiply. That is why. At the beginning, it was originally a mold. Later, it gradually split, from one to two, and from two to four, and so on. The force of proliferation gradually expanded. Now, let's assume that the rate of proliferation is that the fission function is performed once every small amount. Then, within 24 hours, one mold has turned into 16 million. From this point of view, the following matters can be inferred:</p>
<p>(1) How vigorous is the reproductive power of mold bacteria?</p>
<p>(2) Why do countless pathogenic bacteria occur in the patient's body?</p>
<p>(3) Why does the patient's sputum contain countless tubercle bacilli?</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Resistance of Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The resistance of tubercle bacilli is extremely strong. Ascertaining the magnitude of its resistance is of utmost importance for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. When the sputum of tuberculosis patients is left in the air, the survival of tubercle bacilli can last for more than half a year. If placed in a dark room lacking light, they can still survive for more than a year. These bacteria are particularly resistant to cold. They can withstand temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius for six or seven weeks without dying. Their resistance to heat is also stronger than that of other bacteria. Other bacteria die after being exposed to a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius for 20 to 30 minutes, while these bacteria require a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius for 20 to 30 minutes to be killed. However, their resistance to sunlight is very weak. They die after being exposed to direct sunlight for five to six minutes, and they die after being exposed to heat of 100 degrees Celsius or higher for one to two minutes. In terms of disinfectants, tubercle bacilli from tuberculosis patients die in 20 times concentrated carbolic acid water in 30 seconds, in 100 times concentrated carbolic acid water in one minute, and in 1000 times concentrated mercuric chloride water in ten minutes.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Dewaxing and Killing Method for Tuberculosis Bacteria <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location, cutting off the blood supply. Furthermore, the tubercle bacillus can secrete an acid-fast waxy substance that surrounds its body to defend against the invasion of all external medicinal forces. Therefore, even with various antibacterial drugs administered internally or by injection, they ultimately cannot reach the substance of the bacteria. The natural therapies, symptomatic therapies, physical therapies, serum therapies, pharmaceutical therapies, and all other treatments that physicians have traditionally used have not been entirely successful. The saying that there is no cure for tuberculosis has been widespread because the profound principle was not known. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above theory, continue to research tirelessly. As a result, they have created this chemical panacea for completely killing tubercle bacilli, called Sanosn. This medicine was successfully invented based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of tubercle bacilli, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of the tubercle bacillus dewaxing technique. According to experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this medicine has the effect of penetrating the nodules of the pulmonary lesions and dissolving the waxy substance. It has bactericidal power and can radically cure tuberculosis in stages one, two, and three, with truly effective results. In China, the Central Hygiene Laboratory of the National Government has tested it and found that the medicine is mild in nature, non-toxic, and has absolutely no side effects. A brief summary of its therapeutic effects is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When testing the medicinal power of "Sanosn" in a test tube, after one minute, all tubercle bacilli are completely killed, without exception.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, it was discovered that "Sanosn" can penetrate the tuberculosis lesion. Examination of the tubercle bacilli lurking within the lesion revealed that they have completely lost their acid-fastness. This sufficiently proves that their waxy substance has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take "Sanosn" internally for about a week, a noticeable improvement in their condition will be observed, such as thinning of sputum and a decrease in body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) Continuing to take "Sanosn" internally for 30 to 60 days or more will result in a significant increase in body weight, increased appetite, and gradual alleviation of all symptoms, ultimately achieving the miraculous effect of recovery.</p>
<h3 id="e131">A complimentary Sanosn experimental report and tuberculosis care guide will be sent upon request. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>

<p>The Committee for Research on Japanese Goods and the Committee for Inspection are composed of one representative from each industry as a committee member. Currently, representatives from seventy or eighty industries have reported. The Committee for Research held its first meeting yesterday and decided to conduct research in groups. The Committee for Inspection will also convene its first meeting at 2:00 PM today to actively proceed. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Research Committee: The first meeting of the Committee for Research on Boycotting Japanese Goods of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was held yesterday in the conference room of the General Chamber of Commerce. The meeting was chaired by Zheng Chengqing, the director of the committee, and recorded by Jin Shengbai. Resolutions were made as follows for each industry: (1) Regarding the proposal to elect standing committee members, it was resolved to elect Zheng Zenan, Ye Chunqiao, Ye Jiaxing, Ke Yuyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Yang Housheng, Lu Qisheng, Shao Baoxing, and Fu Zuoheng as the nine standing committee members. (2) Regarding the discussion of group formation methods, it was resolved to follow the general rules and divide them into four groups: luxury goods, general goods, necessities, and industrial raw materials. The number of people in each group is not limited, and their work is determined by the representatives of each industry. They were immediately identified on the spot, and Ye Jiaxing was appointed as the director of the luxury goods group, Zhou Xiangsheng as the director of the general goods group, Shao Baoxing as the director of the necessities group, and Sheng Tongsun as the director of the industrial raw materials group. Zheng Chengqing was publicly elected as the convener. (3) Regarding the proposal submitted by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to the industrial associations of various industries to handle the industrial raw material extraction of the industrial fund, it was resolved that the method for the custody and distribution of raw materials and funds was passed, and submitted to the necessities and industrial raw materials groups for research. (4) Regarding the letter from the Science Instrument Museum requesting research on academic experimental instruments and methods to boycott factory raw materials, it was resolved to submit it to the industrial raw materials group for research. (5) Temporary proposals: (A) Letters from various industries requesting research on various cases, it was resolved to submit each volume to the respective groups for research according to their nature. (B) Zheng Zenan, the representative of the sugar industry, proposed that the government issue 5 million yuan in public bonds to establish domestic sugar factories to boycott Japanese sugar. It was resolved to submit it to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Reply to the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce explains that Japanese goods registered in accordance with the law do not incur fees in accordance with the regulations of the Anti-Japanese Association. The collection of relief funds is limited only to Japanese goods purchased after the 14th and before the 24th, and those that have not followed the registration procedures and are directly reported for transportation, and are therefore detained. The original letter stated that the letter received from Zhanlai on the 8th of this month requested that the Anti-Japanese Association be notified to return all industrial and commercial imports before the establishment of the association and release them without restriction. The Anti-Japanese Association had already published a public announcement on the steps to deal with Japanese goods. The first item of A stipulates that Japanese goods purchased by merchants before July 14th should be registered with the association within the registration deadline. After the registration period expires, certificates will be issued to allow them to be sold without charge. Therefore, the statement in the letter that "Japanese goods before the 14th, registered according to law, must donate 10%" is not specified in the association's announcement. It is unknown what the Knitting Industry Association of your city is based on. As for the statement in your association that "imports from various factories before the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Association should be released without restriction," the first item of Article A stipulated by the association is handled in this way. However, the registration procedure is indispensable, otherwise, how would it be known whether it was purchased before the 14th or after the 14th? Therefore, registration without charge is what your association calls unrestricted release. As for Japanese goods purchased with silver before July 14th that have not been registered and are reported for transport and sale, those that have been discovered by the Anti-Japanese Association should be levied a relief fund of 10% and supplemented with registration, etc., because before registration, the movement of Japanese goods was stopped. The Anti-Japanese Association had already announced this, but the merchants still ignored it and continued to transport and sell them. It cannot be said that they were taking advantage of the opportunity to avoid registration. Therefore, the treatment method cannot but be slightly different from those who purchased and stored silver before July 14th and did not move it. As for Japanese goods purchased with silver after July 14th and before July 24th, the Anti-Japanese Association had already been established at that time, and an economic severance with Japan had already been decided. The knitting industry association in your city also believes that it should be punished after the leadership of the group. Therefore, there is a method of collecting 10% or 20% of the fund depending on whether it is registered or not. The original letter from the knitting industry association in your city already stated that it should be punished, but suddenly pointed out that the method of adding the fund was an increase in cost out of thin air, expressing dissent. The arguments before and after are inevitably inconsistent. Summarizing the above situation, there are those that are completely misreported, such as saying that "registration before the 14th according to law, a fee of 10%, and those that have been shipped and seized will be charged 20%," and those whose own arguments are inconsistent. There is no need to send another letter to the Anti-Japanese Association. A detailed explanation is hereby made, hoping that you will check and forward it.</p>

<p>Report from the Japanese Commercial Officer</p>
<p>Rare in trade history</p>
<p>The office of the Japanese Commercial Consul in Shanghai received a telegram from the Ministry of Commerce in Japan yesterday, stating that Japan's export trade in July was worth 10.03 million Japanese yen, and compared with import trade, there was a surplus of 9 million yen. However, the results of foreign trade in the first seven months of this year show a total import surplus of 10.03 million yen, which is slightly less than the import surplus of 10.07 million yen in the same period last year. In addition, the status of Japan's foreign trade with major countries in the first half of this year is as follows: exports to the United States are worth 19.5 million yuan, resulting in a surplus of 4.8 million yuan; exports to China are worth 14 million yuan, resulting in a deficit of 1.9 million yuan (according to China, this is a trade surplus with Japan, a rare phenomenon in Sino-Japanese trade); exports to India are worth 57 million yuan, resulting in a deficit of 32 million yuan.</p>

<p>Encouraging each other to deal with the Korean incident with disheveled hair and a crowned hat</p>
<p>The standing committee members of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, Wang Xingyi and others, telegraphed to express their opinions on calming the Korean riots, protecting overseas Chinese, and dealing with the aftermath, requesting the government to adopt and implement them. Yesterday, the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters replied by telegram: Respectfully addressed to the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, the telegram has been received in detail. In this tragic incident of Koreans expelling the Chinese, our lives and property have suffered deeply. After reporting earlier, we have earnestly reached out to the Central Government and the diplomatic authorities to urgently plan countermeasures. The matter concerns international affairs, and there will be concrete policies. Gentlemen, your loud calls and the expression of your indignation are admired.

<h3 id="e135">Arrest of Deng and Road Repair Case Across the Border <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved the road repair before it was carried out</p>
<p>The arrest of Deng was due to his suspected reactionary activities</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mayor Zhang Qun at the Municipal Government yesterday, and he gave the following statement to the reporter regarding the road repair across the border and the arrest of Deng Jiayan and others:</p>
<p>Road repair across the border: According to the report, the section across the border was repaired by the Public Works Bureau after the Public Works Bureau requested the Municipal Government, and it was approved and permitted by the Municipal Government before the bureau could handle it. Its administrative jurisdiction still belongs to the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government will also send staff to supervise and review it during the repair in the future. Those who do not understand this method may have some misunderstandings, but it is unknown within the scope of a city that the citizens voluntarily want to be responsible for repairing the roads, and the government can naturally allow it. However, its supervisory power still belongs to the government. Moreover, the method is temporary, and the Municipal Government will handle it in the future.</p>
<p>The situation of the Deng case: Before the arrest of Deng Jiayan this time, the Public Security Bureau received a report from the foreign side and immediately sent police to search and arrest him. Deng and others are currently under interrogation. If they are indeed suspected of being reactionary, they will naturally be punished according to law to prohibit villains and curb the source of chaos. If they are indeed not suspected of being reactionary, they will naturally be allowed bail.</p>

<p>Sailor returns home...dancer suddenly on board</p>
<p>Dancer is expelled...sailor drowns in the sea</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre...two people meet with joy</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reported that there was a pair of dance partners in the New Victoria bar. The man was Duencun, a sailor on the Bardohong steamer, and the woman was Xie Liefusijia Ya, an 18-year-old girl living at 516 Avenue Joffre. The two were deeply in love and danced until midnight. Before long, the Bardohong set sail and headed for Seattle across the Pacific Ocean. On Friday afternoon last week, when the ship entered the sea, Xie was suddenly found in Du's cabin. Because she did not want to taste the pain of parting, she secretly boarded the ship to go to the United States with him. However, she was discovered by her colleagues, and she was returned to the ship and forcibly sent ashore at Wusong, and a telegram was sent to the manager of the company in Shanghai to send someone to accompany her back to Shanghai. Then, she turned her helm to the east again. Unexpectedly, after a few hours, Duencun was reported missing again. A thorough search of the ship found nothing. Until seventeen hours later, the Japanese ship Zhaoguo Maru passed by and caught sight of a person in the sea. It quickly released a small boat to rescue him, and it turned out to be Du. When asked about the reason, he said that he secretly carried a life jacket and jumped into the sea when the ship left Wusong, wanting to swim ashore to follow his lover. Unexpectedly, the tide receded and the water was rapid, and he drifted into the sea. He was rescued by the Japanese ship near a buoy sixty miles away and handed over to the caretaker of the buoy, who entrusted a German ship to carry him back to Shanghai. He arrived in port yesterday and was notified by the water patrol to the US Patrol Station to send someone to escort him ashore. After questioning, he was released because there was no specific article of law. After Du left the US Patrol Station, he quickly walked to the French Concession and met his lover in a room on Avenue Joffre with joy. He now hopes to find a place to stay in Shanghai so that he can discuss marriage with Xie.</p>
<p>Woman from Haimen</p>
<h3 id="e143">Accuses the owner of Qinglian Pavilion <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The statements in the lawsuit are extremely dirty</p>
<p>Beaten and injured, requests punishment</p>
<p>Sun Yunqing (i.e., Sun Shaorui), the owner of Qinglian Pavilion Teahouse at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road, a local person, is over sixty years old and lives at No. 16 Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. Recently, Jiang Cuiling, a 26-year-old woman from Haimen, hired lawyer Chen Bingxing to sue him for injury in the First Special District Court. The gist of the lawsuit is extracted as follows: It is a matter of requesting punishment according to law for being punched, injured, and coughing up blood. I, the plaintiff, was originally a woman from a good family. I came to Shanghai when I was young and lived with my relatives. Unexpectedly, I was lured and sold by a villain to the defendant's home as a maid. At that time, the plaintiff's parents came to Shanghai and learned of the situation. They reported it to the former Mixed Court, and the villain was sentenced to imprisonment. After the case was settled, the plaintiff's father wanted to take her back, but the defendant repeatedly dissuaded him and asked her to stay there. He agreed to it. How could he know that the defendant was a beast in human clothing, without humanity, and actually used violent and coercive means to commit indecency. At that time, the plaintiff was young and ignorant, had no strength to resist, and it was a matter of face, so she dared not publicize it and endured humiliation for several years. During these several years, she suffered all kinds of abuse. For example, in April of last year, she was punched in the chest by the defendant, causing her to breathe painfully and cough up blood. The plaintiff originally wanted to sue him for the crime, but she was persuaded by many parties to stop. However, the plaintiff suffered this blow and was bedridden for more than a month. She was treated by Chinese medicine doctor Wang Zhongqi, and the coughing up of blood stopped. However, there is still pain in her chest today. Especially when the defendant was sick, his ambition did not diminish, and he wanted to have sex with her. If he did not comply, he would be threatened. This kind of behavior is really devoid of conscience. However, the defendant bullies the weak by relying on his strength, and it is getting worse day by day. On July 21 of this year, the plaintiff was in her menstrual period, but the defendant insisted on his lust and forced her to have sex. The plaintiff refused politely, which aroused his anger. On the 22nd of this month, he dared to beat the plaintiff with old fists on the pretext of beating the plaintiff, injuring her shoulders, waist, chest, etc. At that time, she coughed up several mouthfuls of blood, and there were people present who witnessed it. This kind of tragic situation was treated by Dr. Chen Xingzhen and is currently taking medicine. It is found that the defendant has repeatedly used cruel means to deal with the plaintiff, a weak and helpless woman. If she does not seek legal relief, her life will inevitably be in danger. For the sake of survival, in addition to submitting the two injury reports for verification at the trial, she is suing in accordance with Article 293 of the Criminal Law, requesting that the case be brought to justice and punished as deserved, and that she be ordered to compensate for the corresponding medical expenses, etc. The court approved the statement and issued a ticket. This morning, Judge Shen Shumu came to the court to gather information. The plaintiff, Jiang Cuiling, and her agent, lawyer Chen Bingxing, were present to present the case, but the defendant, Sun Yunqing, was not present. The agent lawyer, Ni Zheng, was present and requested a postponement. Judge Shen ordered that the case be postponed for another hearing.</p>

<p>Cao Aliuh repays his mother</p>
<p>Encountered the murderer Pan Xiaodi</p>
<p>Cao Ren'an, a native of Tongzhou, is 26 years old and works as a rickshaw puller. He lives with his wife, Zuo, and his brother, Cao Aliuh, at No. 20 Yongxing Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. On February 18th of the lunar calendar last year, Cao Zuo suddenly disappeared. After her husband, Ren'an, investigated in detail, he learned that she was seduced by his fellow villager Pan Xiaodi (25 years old, also a rickshaw puller) and fled to Dongsha, Nantongzhou, to live together. Therefore, his mother, Cao Zhang, went to Tongzhou alone in early May, intending to bring back his daughter-in-law, Zuo. Unexpectedly, on May 6th, Pan Xiaodi, together with two accomplices, brutally murdered her. First, Cao Zhang was shot to death with a pistol, and then her body was dismembered with a sharp knife and cut into seven pieces. Later, Ren'an heard about it in Shanghai and rushed to Tongzhou to report to the local authorities. In July, he captured two accomplices in the case, Hong Lianmazi and others, who confessed clearly and have already been executed by shooting. However, the murderer, Pan Xiaodi, has been at large and has not been arrested. Until about 6:00 AM on the 8th of this month, Pan Xiaodi was pulling a rickshaw from south to north on Xinnan Road when he was spotted by Cao Aliuh. He called the police, Nos. 1254 and 2886, who arrested Pan Xiaodi and brought him to the police station. Cao Aliuh was also temporarily detained as a key witness in the case. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stood up and presented the case. Cao Ren'an and Cao Aliuh also successively surrendered and explained the previous situation. When questioned, the defendant, Pan Xiaodi, confessed that the facts were falsely accused. After Cao Zuo disappeared, I and Ren'an searched everywhere. Later, I heard people say that she was abducted to Nantongzhou by my friend. I went to Tongzhou in May to search unsuccessfully and returned to Shanghai on the 13th. The plaintiffs should point out that I went to Tongzhou to inform them, and now they falsely accuse me of colluding to kill their mother. Please investigate clearly. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession, he ordered Pan Xiaodi to be temporarily detained, pending the arrival of the official documents from Nantong County, before submitting the case for trial. Cao Aliuh was released in court.</p>

<p>Appearance...Western Suit and Leather Shoes</p>
<p>Pocket...Three Copper Coins</p>
<p>A certain son of Zhu Cheng-cai of Ningbo, because of a previous crime, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment by the Hangzhou District Court. Sun Wenbin of Hangzhou learned of this matter and went to the Zhu family in Ningbo, telling them that he was very influential and that if they could spend several hundred gold coins, he could get their son released from prison. Zhu felt that he did not have such a large sum of money, so he thought of his cousin Xu Lichao, who opened the Xin Wan Xing Hotel at 1576 Wusong Road in Shanghai, who might be able to help. So he accompanied Sun to Shanghai on the Xin Jiang Tian steamboat on the 3rd of this month. When they arrived, Zhu suddenly discovered that a rattan suitcase had disappeared, containing twelve silver dollars and a letter from Xu Lichao instructing him to fetch his son Lian Gen's luggage (Lian Gen was an apprentice at Xin Wan Xing, but he no longer works there). Sun also disappeared at that time. Zhu immediately went to his cousin Xu Lichao and asked him to detain Sun if he came to collect the luggage under false pretenses. Then he returned to Ningbo. At half past nine in the morning, Sun indeed came to Xin Wan Xing with the letter to claim Lian Gen's luggage. Xu Lichao reported this to the Hongkou Police Station, and Chinese Detective Mao Yiwen and Detective Shen Dehui were ordered to arrest Sun and take him to the police station. Twenty-six cards were found on his person, printed with the words "Graduate of the Law Department of the Whampoa Central Political and Military Academy of Guangdong," "Prosecutor Sun Lie of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court Special Zone Court," and a certificate from the Recruitment Office of the Second Division of the National Government Garrison Army Zhejiang Special Zone, a badge from the Central Military Academy, and a badge from the Nanxun Railway No. 226. He was immediately taken into custody. The court clerk was also asked whether there was a person named Sun Lie in the court. The answer was that there was no such person. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case and asked for a strict investigation. Zhu Cheng-cai and others then testified. The defendant confessed that Sun Lie was indeed another person, a friend of his, who was now serving in the military somewhere. All the cards and badges belonged to him. On the 5th of this month, he came to Shanghai from Ningbo and got separated from Zhu at the dock. Yesterday, he went to Xin Wan Xing to inquire whether Zhu had been there and was arrested. He denied stealing Zhu Cheng-cai's twelve silver dollars. After Judge Xiao Xiexun verified the confession, he sentenced Sun Wenbin to one year of imprisonment in court. The twenty-six cards were confiscated, and the badges and certificates were presented to the court. It is said that when Sun was arrested, he was dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes, but his pocket was empty, with only three copper coins.</p>

<p>Accusing Husband of Stealing Clothes and Cash</p>
<p>Court Hearing This Morning</p>
<p>Huo Yue'e, a Cantonese woman currently residing at 162 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road, is 26 years old. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, she married Ding Lucheng, a graduate of Guanghua University who works as a clerk at the Dahua Electric Company on the upper floor of the Shuimingchang Wood Shop at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, through a matchmaker. Recently, Ding fell in love with a woman named Hui Zhen, which led to disagreements between the couple, eventually leading to divorce. Three days after the divorce, Ding took away all of Huo's clothes and other items. Huo then hired lawyer Xi Ya'fu to file a complaint with the Special District Court, requesting that he be punished for theft and that the items be returned. Her complaint stated that the plaintiff married the defendant in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and the relationship between the couple was very harmonious. However, the defendant was naturally lustful and, after marrying, continued to seek pleasure with prostitutes, becoming acquainted with Hui Zhen. He deliberately abandoned the plaintiff and often abused her. When she argued with him, the defendant relied on his financial power to hire a lawyer to send letters to lure her, forcing her to break off the marriage relationship with the defendant. Since she was ignorant and without the help of relatives and friends, she had no choice but to sign a separation agreement at the defendant's lawyer's office on July 10, with the defendant paying alimony of 650 yuan. He would first pay 200 yuan, and the remaining amount would be paid at 25 yuan per month. All of the plaintiff's clothes, boxes, and other items were to belong to the plaintiff. However, the defendant was heartless and listened to the slanders of his mistress, taking advantage of the plaintiff's isolation. On the afternoon of July 13, while she was out shopping, he came to her house and secretly stole a phonograph, thirty-two records, and a mineral leather suitcase. The tenants Guan Manli and her nanny witnessed this. The suitcase contained a gray squirrel cheongsam, a silk gauze cloak, a wool coat, a velvet-lined cheongsam, and a silk velvet-lined cheongsam, each one piece. The defendant had given her eighty silver dollars, and since the plaintiff was stranded in a foreign land with no relatives or close friends, the stolen clothing items were her daily wear, and the remaining eighty dollars was her only remaining money. Now that he had stolen everything, he was practically putting her to death. She has now filed a complaint with the Fifth Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau, and therefore files this complaint, requesting assistance in summoning the ruthless and unrighteous defendant to court and punishing him for the crime under Article 337 of the criminal law. The court approved the complaint and scheduled a court hearing for this morning (the 11th).</p>

<h3 id="e149">Concession Telephone Numbers to be Changed <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Due to Relocation to New Automatic Switching Room</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Road Telephone Company issued an important notice yesterday to inform users: For a considerable period in the past, the telephone lines of some users have been connected to two switching rooms, one is the old switching room, and the other is the new switching room. The user may not even know this. This is a necessary procedure in order to move thousands of telephone lines to the new switching room simultaneously in an instant. Now the time for the move is ripe, so there are already two places that will be switched from the old switching room, one is Bixun (users whose first digit of the phone number is 7), and the other is Huishan (users whose first digit of the phone number is 5). These two new automatic switching rooms will be put into practical use in the near future. The official date will be announced in the notice and in the newspapers. To avoid disappointment for users, please pay attention to the following point: Because of the merger of the two types of machines, there has been a slight obstacle. Therefore, during this relocation, there will be a risk of confusion when separating the two types of machines. However, our company is confident that all users will be delighted to see this relocation, as it is another step closer to a more perfect telephone service. Given the size of Shanghai, it is necessary to increase telephone zones. Therefore, many telephone numbers have been changed. Our company has a special request for all users: when calling numbers starting with 3, 4, 5, or 7, please check the changed number list first. The changed number list (attached) shows the numbers that have been changed after the telephone line relocation. Before the telephone line is relocated, do not use the new number. However, after the relocation, everyone must use the new number.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Rickshaw License Donation Turmoil Settles <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Licenses Were Issued in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>The details of the rickshaw license donation dispute in Wusong have been recorded in previous newspapers. Previously, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau requested the municipal government to consider that rickshaw pullers are mostly poor people and cannot afford the fees. Therefore, a flexible method was determined, temporarily allowing them to pay half the donation, and increasing it after the city center area is expanded in the future. However, for the time being, they are only allowed to operate in the Wusong area, with a quota of 163 vehicles. However, there are currently about 200 rickshaws in Wusong, so the rickshaw pullers were panicked when they heard the news and sent representatives to petition the Eighth District Party Headquarters several times. At eight o'clock yesterday morning, all the rickshaws gathered in front of the vehicle affairs office on the outer road to wait for inspection and to receive licenses. The District Party Headquarters and the Seventh District Public Security Bureau feared that disputes would arise and sent personnel to the scene to take care of the situation and explain to the rickshaw pullers. The order was quite good at the time. The vehicle affairs office stipulated that each rickshaw puller could only receive one license, and a total of 154 licenses were issued. There were nine licenses remaining. However, there were more than 30 vehicles in the Baoshan area. Because there was a surplus, they were not issued. At the request of the rickshaw pullers, Director An agreed to find a way to increase the number in the shortest possible time. Therefore, this turmoil was settled.</p>
<p>Sino-Foreign Pharmacy</p>
<h3 id="e151">Su Renjie and Others Appeal Opens <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Su Denies Being the Manager</p>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Pharmacy at 69 Guangdong Road was found to be selling prohibited drugs by Song Bingzheng, Bao Tan Zhang Shaoqing, Ding Yugao, etc. of the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Patrol Room. They went to search the premises and seized morphine, cocaine, heroin, red pills, opium, etc., worth about 40,000 yuan, as well as a gas pistol. The manager of the store, Su Renjie, the accountant Rui Lai (i.e. Rui Lan), the owner Qiao Zixing (i.e. Qu Fengjie, the owner of Wanfeng Lumber Mill in Pudong), and the chief accountant Sun Chunsheng were arrested and handed over to the Special District Court. The court sentenced Su and Qiao to three years of imprisonment each and fined them 5,000 yuan. Wang Ruilan and Sun Chunsheng were sentenced to two years of imprisonment each and fined them 4,000 yuan. The prohibited items were confiscated. Su and the other four were not satisfied with the judgment and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, Song Yuan, the criminal court president of the High Court branch, together with Judges Du and Ye, held a hearing to question them. The patrol room was represented by lawyer Zhang Tianyin. Court President Song first asked Su Renjie if he was the manager of Sino-Foreign Pharmacy. Su replied that he was not. The manager's name was Zhang Changgui, and the accountant's name was Gao Ruyuan. He was a shop assistant in the retail department. On May 10th, Manager Zhang had to go to a friend's place for a drink and asked him to hand over two sample packages from the drawer when someone came to pick up samples. He then went out. At 11 o'clock, the detectives came and arrested him. Mr. Song then asked if he had confessed that morphine was 18 yuan per tael. He replied that this was a false confession, and that his real name was Su Chunlin, and Renjie was a pseudonym. The manager's monthly salary was over 100 yuan, while his monthly salary was only 29 yuan, which clearly showed that he was not the manager. Regarding this point, there was a salary book to prove it. When Wang Ruilan was questioned, he confessed that he was the one who managed the banknotes at the foreign account desk, with a monthly salary of 32 yuan. The matter of morphine was secretly operated by the manager, and he did not participate in it. Qiao Zixing confessed that he went to Sino-Foreign Pharmacy to visit his friend Zhang Changgui that day, and was arrested as soon as he entered the parlor. His real name was not Qu Fengjie, Qu was his former cohabitant. Court President Song asked Qiao if he had been sentenced to six months of imprisonment by the court in the tenth year of the Republic of China for selling drugs, and whether he had been imprisoned under the name of Qu Fengjie at that time. He replied that it was, but this fact was an injustice, and that he had opened a Wanfeng lumber mill in Pudong, which could be investigated. Sun Chunsheng confessed that he was doing transactions with Xia Jiasheng, a broker at Taixing No. 28 of the Gauze Exchange, and did not hold any position in Sino-Foreign Pharmacy. He was also visiting Zhang Changgui that day. After Court President Song verified the confessions, he ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Regarding the Relationship Between the Free City of Danzig and the Sino-Polish Treaty</p>
<p>Mr. Weidengdao, the Polish Chargé d'Affaires in China, regarding the relationship between the Free City of Danzig and the new Sino-Polish Treaty, accompanied by Counselor Deng Laixin, visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai Office at Fenglin Bridge last Saturday afternoon to explain the matter in person. Yesterday, he sent a formal note to the Foreign Ministry. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the Polish Embassy on Xiafei Road, French Concession, at 3 p.m. yesterday to inquire about the matter. The note had not yet been sent out. According to Counselor Deng, the note would be sent out tonight (i.e. last night). The content concerns the relationship between the Free City of Danzig and Article 20 of the Sino-Polish Treaty. I cannot disclose the details now. I will inform you when the time comes for publication. Although Danzig is a free city, its diplomacy and the jurisdiction around the city belong to Poland. Article 20 of the Sino-Polish Treaty contains provisions relating to this diplomacy. The Polish government recently issued instructions to the Polish Chargé d'Affaires regarding this matter. Therefore, Mr. Weidengdao, in addition to explaining the matter to Foreign Minister Wang in person at the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai Office last Saturday afternoon, also formally notified the Foreign Ministry last night in order to avoid this procedure.</p>

<p>According to the joint petition from the headmen Lu Yuanxiang and Zhu Shengwu, etc., of various "hei tu" within the 30th "bao" of the district: "We have observed that since the beginning of the 'Great Heat' solar term, continuous torrential rains have lasted for over ten days. River water has surged, and the bean crops in the fields have been soaked, causing the roots to rot. Weeds have proliferated, making it impossible to hoe or cultivate. Farmers are distressed and worried, all saying that disaster has already struck, and their cries of suffering fill the sky. Moreover, this year's spring harvest was also poor. If another famine occurs, it is unimaginable how we will survive. The headmen have witnessed the situation and know that disaster has struck, with no hope for the autumn harvest. We feel the pain deeply. Therefore, we specially submit this petition for your committee's review and approval, and request that it be forwarded to the Bureau of Social Affairs so they may quickly dispatch personnel to conduct an on-site inspection and devise methods for relief in advance. We await your orders with utmost urgency."</p>
<p>While we were preparing to submit this petition, we also received a letter from Yao Shuda, the executive director of the Songhu District Farmers' Association, stating: "The agricultural crops in our district are mainly cotton and beans. The 'Summer Solstice' and 'Slight Heat' solar terms are the time for cotton cultivation. However, due to continuous rainfall, the rivers have overflowed, flooding the plains by several feet. Cotton and bean crops have been submerged, and weeds have grown unchecked, signaling a water shortage. The national tax and people's livelihood depend on agricultural production. Now, due to the rain disaster, there is no hope for the autumn harvest. How will farmers maintain their livelihoods? As a farmer, Shuda, on behalf of farmers, specifically writes to you, respectfully requesting you to report to the government to seek a solution to this situation and provide relief to the people's livelihood."</p>
<p>Having received this information, we have learned that agricultural products in the district mainly consist of cotton and beans. Now, due to continuous torrential rains, the harvest is already hopeless. Based on the aforementioned circumstances, we should prepare a document to submit to your bureau, requesting you to quickly dispatch personnel to conduct an on-site inspection and devise relief measures to alleviate the people's livelihood. This is truly a matter of public benefit.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association received a telegram from the Jurong County Government of Jiangsu, stating: "Our county is located in a low-lying area, mostly consisting of polders. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer, continuous torrential rains have fallen, causing mountain floods and river water to flow backward. Dozens of polder dikes have collapsed, and houses have been swept away. The disaster-stricken people are unable to get a single full meal all day long. Replanting is impossible, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest."</p>
<p>They also received a telegram from the Wukang County Relief Committee of Zhejiang, stating: "Since the beginning of summer, our county has experienced intermittent torrential rains, making it difficult to plant in low-lying areas. Unexpectedly, since July 23rd, torrential rains have poured down, continuing for six days and nights without stopping. Mountain floods have flowed straight down, and lake water has overflowed the banks, causing them to collapse and breach. Farmland in the four rural areas has been almost entirely submerged, and countless houses have collapsed. The number of people and livestock drowned is also countless. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and the disaster-stricken people are trapped."</p>
<p>They also received a telegram from various organizations in Wangjiang County, Anhui, stating: "Wangjiang borders lakes and rivers and is often affected by floods. This year, since the beginning of summer, continuous torrential rains have fallen day and night. Mountain floods and river water have attacked from both inside and outside, causing over seventy polders, including Dongxing, and the fertile land along the lakes in various townships to be completely submerged. Now, the disaster-stricken people have no way to survive and no way to find food. Their cries of suffering fill the fields, and they are starving."</p>
<p>They also received a telegram from the Southern Third District Flood Relief Committee of Lai'an County, Anhui, stating: "Since the beginning of summer, our county has been hit by a major flood disaster. Over twenty polders, large and small, have been turned into a swamp. Houses have been swept away, and people have been displaced. Maintaining livelihoods is currently very difficult."</p>
<p>They also received a telegram from Cao Qingquan, a resident of the Haikouzhou Guangcheng Polder in Huaining County, Anhui, stating: "Since recently, our polder has experienced continuous heavy rains, causing mountain floods to break out and river tides to rise sharply, leading to the collapse of the polder dike and the destruction of countless houses. Food, livestock, and utensils have been swept away. Thousands of households of men, women, old, and young in the entire polder were unable to escape in time, resulting in many drownings. Now, we are without clothes or food, and our suffering is extreme."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Plan for the Municipal Construction of a National Goods Department Store <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>A Four-Story Steel-Framed Building</p>
<p>Located at the Old West Gate Triangle</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall moved to Zhonghua Road at the Xiaodongmen, it has been renovated and expanded, looking completely new. However, the building is still not large enough. Therefore, the hall decided to design and build its own grand new building. After finding the Old West Gate triangle, they prepared a plan, submitted it to Mayor Zhang and Director Pan for approval, and filed it with the Ministry of Interior. They are now actively planning and proceeding with the project. It is said that after completion, part of it will be used as the National Goods Exhibition Hall, and the rest will be an attached National Goods Department Store. The plan has been approved by the Municipal Council, allowing the land to be acquired for construction. The matter will be handled jointly by the four bureaus of Social Affairs, Public Works, Finance, and Land, together with the Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency inquired with each bureau and obtained the following plan:</p>
<p>Acquisition of Land: The triangle near the Chen Yingshi Memorial Pagoda at the West Gate, with a total area of slightly less than 3.3 mu (Chinese acres), is private land. The Land Bureau is currently surveying and purchasing it, and the purchase price is expected to be around 100,000 yuan. After the purchase, a five-story concrete steel-framed building will be constructed there, to be used as the Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall and an attached department store.</p>
<p>Construction Costs: The Public Works Bureau estimates that the construction cost of the building is 1,200 taels of silver per "fang" (a unit of area). Excluding the area designated for road construction, the total land occupies 170 "fang," requiring a total construction cost of over 280,000 yuan. Including 80,000 yuan for elevators, water, electricity, sanitation, and roofing equipment, and 120,000 yuan for land prices and demolition costs, the total cost is estimated to be over 500,000 yuan. It is said that the funds have been designated by the Municipal Government to be allocated from the business tax revenue.</p>
<p>Internal Arrangement: The layout inside the building will be as follows: The fourth floor will be used for the exhibition hall's office and for displaying national goods. The remaining first, second, and third floors will be used as a department store. It is estimated that a total of 50 buildings can be constructed. In the future, national goods manufacturers will rent the premises to set up shops for business, and the hall will collect rent at its discretion. The building will also be equipped with two elevators. The entire building will also have its own power generation equipment for lighting. The latest methods will be used for fire prevention and sanitation equipment. Construction will begin in October of this year, and it is expected to be completed by the Double Tenth Festival (October 10th) next year at the latest.</p>
<p>Remarks from the Director: Dong Kerin, the director of the Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall, said, "Recently, gold prices have soared, and everything has become expensive. During this period, promoting national goods is definitely the best opportunity. Although there is no shortage of organizations promoting national goods in Shanghai, there is still a lack of a liaison and guidance organization for reference in the city. The design of our hall's new building is for this purpose. Currently, the building design and the acquisition of land have been decided, and the required funds have also been approved by the Municipal Government, allocating 500,000 yuan from business tax revenue. The eastern part of the building will be four stories, and the western part will be five stories. In addition to the three floors dedicated to the department store and the fourth floor for the exhibition hall, a spacious auditorium will be arranged on the fifth floor on the west side. All construction will be carried out using the latest engineering methods. As soon as the Public Works Bureau has completed the drawings and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval, construction will begin. In the future, with this organization promoting national goods in southern Shanghai, it will not only be easier for the public to understand the urgency of using national goods to save the country, but also the commercial activity in the West Gate area will become more prosperous."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Proposed Ten Issues to the Shanghai Municipal Council Suggesting Improvement of Municipal Administration <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Requests a Deadline for Research and Implementation</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai and Xu Wanqing, the chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association, sent a letter to Macnaghten, the chairman of the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday, regarding the issue of improving municipal administration. The letter stated, "Dear Sir, We have the following proposals that we request your attention and adoption by the chairman and all directors. We believe that municipal administration is evolving rather than static and should gradually improve with the times and the situation. What the residents like should be liked, and what the residents dislike should be disliked. The municipal administration of the Shanghai International Settlement has a history of nearly a century. With the evolution of the times and changes in the situation, there are many things that were suitable in the past but are not suitable now. If appropriate solutions that suit the times and the situation are not considered, it will not only cause unnecessary disputes but also hinder the improvement of residents' welfare. From the perspective of our association, the following issues should be addressed: (1) How to improve residents' knowledge of municipal administration; (2) How to establish a common representative body for Chinese and foreign residents to enable more effective cooperation on municipal facilities; (3) How to ensure that the expansion of the city's economy and the residents' economic capacity are mutually adapted; (4) How to ensure that residents are not unfairly burdened with city taxes; (5) How to ensure that land deeds are beneficial and without drawbacks; (6) How to ensure that matters such as interest rates on Chinese merchants' mortgages and pledges comply with Chinese law; (7) How to ensure that the four departments of public works, sanitation, firefighting, and taxation coordinate their intentions and facilitate residents in the issuance of notifications; (8) How to ensure that lower-level employees cannot or dare not engage in disreputable conduct by taking advantage of their positions; (9) How to legally resolve the issue of cross-border road construction; (10) Other issues related to the improvement of municipal administration. For the above suggestions, we sincerely hope that you will allow a period of one year for detailed research and the creation of an execution plan for adoption and implementation. In the opinion of our association, this task should be undertaken by municipal advisors. Our association believes that these suggestions are of great importance to the improvement of municipal administration. We are accordingly sending this letter, hoping that you will examine it carefully and uphold public interests."</p>

<p>Wang Shuxi and Four National Goods Organizations Sent a Telegram to the Organizing Committee of the National Games</p>
<p>Four National Goods Organizations Sent a Telegram to the Organizing Committee of the National Games</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association, Promotion Association, Mechanical Union, and Factory Union held a joint meeting the other day and decided to send a telegram to the Organizing Committee of the National Games, requesting that the commercial areas and advertisements be nationalized and free of charge, and presenting methods. The original telegram stated, "To the Preparatory Committee of the National Games of the Capital: Your committee is devoted to promoting the national spirit and developing sports, making tireless efforts to organize and conduct the games. Your aims are lofty and your intentions profound, and we are deeply impressed. We, the undersigned, have decided at a joint meeting that, for the sake of promoting national glory, the commercial areas and all advertisements within the venue of your committee must be entirely nationalized. By taking advantage of this opportunity, you can give students from all over the country, overseas Chinese, and visiting people the opportunity to recognize national goods, arouse the concept of promoting national goods, and thereby develop industry, in line with the central government's seven sports work objectives. However, we have found that your committee's commercial area recruitment charter and advertising rules all have provisions for paying fees. The government has allocated 1.5 million yuan of national funds to cover the expenses of the National Games. How can these small fees compensate for the actual costs? You should consider that the national goods movement is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and grant a full exemption to support national goods publicity. The national goods sector should also uphold the spirit of promoting sports, cooperation, and mutual assistance. Each manufacturer should select high-quality products to display and demonstrate, and voluntarily sacrifice some products as prizes or gifts to encourage and reward outstanding achievements. We do not have any commercial intentions in this regard, but we dare not lag behind foreigners in promoting national goods. Otherwise, the very small income of your committee will only create opportunities for foreign goods publicity and have a very significant and profound impact on the future of national goods. We, the undersigned, uphold the duty of promoting national goods and are entrusted with the heavy responsibility by hundreds of factories. We are closely related to this matter and respectfully present our views. We jointly send this telegram to your committee, asking you to consider the infancy of the national goods industry and the importance of publicity opportunities. We earnestly request that you approve our request and waive all fees for commercial areas and advertisements, and assist in the implementation of the presentation of exhibits and gifts. This will be fortunate for national goods, and also fortunate for the national economy and the people's livelihood. We look forward to your reply in order to convene factories in Shanghai to discuss methods and actively proceed. We are eagerly awaiting your response. The China National Goods Maintenance Association, Shanghai Citizen National Goods Promotion Association, Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, and Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factory Federation jointly salute, [seal]."</p>

We are responding accordingly, and we hope you will take note. The Ministry of Railways salutes."</p>

However, each person is limited to purchasing one share in order to collect capital from a large number of people, that is, to sell the shoes of this large number of people, so that profit rights do not fall into the hands of others. Its nature is the same as a cooperative. In the future, profits can be assured. It is said that recently the initiators have been recruiting shareholders in separate groups, and the results have been exceptionally good, because with an investment of only 2 yuan, one can obtain the permanent right to purchase shoes at an 80% discount, so those who subscribe to shares are welcome.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Husband Famine</p>
<p>During the Great War, Britain suffered significant losses of soldiers, leading to a sharp decline in the male population domestically. This has made it difficult for women to find husbands, resulting in a "husband famine" phenomenon. According to recent surveys, an unusually large number of British women between the ages of thirty and fifty are living single lives due to the inability to find husbands, breaking previous records.</p>
<p>Hot Air Instead of Towels</p>
<p>In Paris, France, a restroom in a train station has been equipped with a device that emits hot air for drying hands after washing. Instead of using towels, one simply holds their wet hands up to the device, and they will dry in seconds. This is much more convenient than wiping with towels, and the train station can save a significant amount of money each year on purchasing towels.</p>
<p>Palm House</p>
<p>The London Zoo is one of the most famous zoos in the world. Its extensive collection and comprehensive facilities are unmatched by other zoos. Within the zoo is a special palm house, where the temperature is exactly like that of the tropics. Delicate monkeys and wading birds that originate from tropical regions are kept here, so they can live as if they were still in the tropics.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Kang Nanhai's Seal <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Surviving Swords and Arrows</p>
<p>Mr. Kang Youwei was a man from Nanhai County. His original name was Zu Yi. When he participated in the imperial examinations, over six thousand candidates submitted a memorial to the emperor. Kang Youwei took the lead. After gaining official status, he observed that Emperor Dezong was controlled internally by his mother (Empress Dowager Cixi) and externally by powerful traitors. He then sought to implement new policies and purge the court of these treacherous officials. Although he rose in rank through his position as a bureaucrat, he still enjoyed imperial favor. Liang Qichao was a disciple of Kang, and they were both part of the reformist faction. However, their views diverged significantly. Opponents fabricated rumors, claiming that Kang presented red pills to the emperor, clouding his judgment. A political purge ensued, and Kang fled into exile. At that time, a friend presented him with a couplet: "How can there be the poisoner Yang Shuzi, regretting the absence of Cao Zhi; hating the lack of a drafted indictment like Luo Binwang." After the Republic of China was established, Kang returned to the country. In the spring of the second year, when the National Assembly was drafting a constitution, Kang repeatedly requested that Confucianism be established as the state religion, but to no avail. He then went to Xuzhou to meet with Zhang Xun, asking for his assistance. Xun, respecting Kang's character, sent a telegram of support, and the phrase "Confucianism as the state religion" was added to the article on religious freedom. Although this proposal has now been revoked, one cannot help but admire his dedication to promoting sacred learning. Before the restoration attempt, Kang arrived in Beijing and shielded himself with a large palm-leaf fan as he left the train, drawing much criticism. Shortly after, Kang became the president of the Bide Yuan (Office of the President) but resigned after only a few days. He has not held any official positions since. From this, we can see that although Kang was committed to reform, he was not aligned with the revolution. Mr. Kang's writing style was naturally unrestrained, and his calligraphy was elegant and refined. When he came to Xuzhou, I happened to be working as a scribe in the Seventh Route Command Headquarters. I requested that he write a楹聯 (楹聯 yínglián, a pair of scrolls with antithetical sentences displayed vertically) for me, and he stamped it with a large seal, inscribed with the lines: "One hundred days of reform, thirteen years in exile, traveled thirty-two countries, walked four hundred thousand miles." Such a seal is unprecedented and can be said to belong to one of the most talented figures of the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Ode to the Moon After a Long Rain <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>After more than twenty days of wind and rain, the damp clouds suddenly dispersed one day, revealing the bright moon. Wealthy guests set up wine, while disaster victims await food. They both look at the moon, but their joys and sorrows are different. Moved by this, I composed this poem.</p>
<p>Damp clouds have surrounded my house for over twenty days,</p>
<p>Living in seclusion, as if sleeping at the bottom of a well.</p>
<p>The moss is green and thick on all four walls,</p>
<p>Even the snails stretch out their horns and go crazy.</p>
<p>North and south of the great river, the crops are in peril,</p>
<p>East and west of the fields, the water connects endlessly.</p>
<p>The old farmers look up at the roof, sighing helplessly,</p>
<p>Leaving only the empty chapters of Shanfu's water management.</p>
<p>Tonight, I suddenly hear the sound of rain cease,</p>
<p>Outside the window, the dark clouds are swept away by the wind.</p>
<p>In an instant, the clouds disperse, and the moon's disc emerges,</p>
<p>Like a lovely woman applying makeup in the morning.</p>
<p>The clouds are like chaotic clusters embracing the pear blossom face,</p>
<p>Obscuring the moth eyebrows, making them incredibly pitiful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cloud mass comes from the east,</p>
<p>Resembling a venomous dragon crouching in the Big Dipper constellation.</p>
<p>The light shoots from its head, its momentum abruptly rising,</p>
<p>Ferociously pouncing on the icy wheel, swallowing it whole.</p>
<p>It is as if the beauty returned to Zhili,</p>
<p>Frustration fills my heart, impossible to express.</p>
<p>I only see the remaining radiance shooting in all directions,</p>
<p>Like silk threads, like strands, and like fists.</p>
<p>The Wind Goddess suddenly scolds A Xiang to leave,</p>
<p>And the monstrous clouds begin to release the rotating Chang'e.</p>
<p>It is like Wenji returning to the Han people,</p>
<p>Like a dark pearl emerging from the deep abyss.</p>
<p>The clear shadow is admired by all nations together,</p>
<p>But the disaster victims are left to linger on their last breaths.</p>
<p>North and south of the house, white waves float,</p>
<p>Perhaps there are beams washed away without a single tile remaining.</p>
<p>What are my feelings when I look up at the moon at this time?</p>
<p>I only feel sorrow and sob.</p>
<p>What is the intention of those who set up wine in the grand hall?</p>
<p>They spare no expense on delicacies and rare dishes.</p>
<p>The Yue maidens and Wu girls lean against each other, drunk.</p>
<p>Passersby look at them as if they were gods.</p>
<p>How happy are they to look at the moon at this moment?</p>
<p>They are free from all earthly constraints.</p>
<p>Alas, we all look at the same bright moon,</p>
<p>But our joys and sorrows are as different as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I, too, hesitate and cannot bear to look,</p>
<p>Let the bright spirit be round outside the window.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Talking About Miniature Golf <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>In June of last year, a new fad suddenly emerged in the United States – miniature golf – and it quickly swept across the country. Now it has become popular in Shanghai, becoming one of the most fashionable forms of entertainment. Now, I will talk casually about everything about miniature golf.</p>
<p>The Origin of Miniature Golf: Initially, a Mr. Thomson from Mexico and a Mr. Albert from Texas, USA, wanted to play golf. However, the soil in Mexico and Texas contained too much sand, making it unsuitable for golf. They had no choice but to create a rudimentary form of golf to satisfy their craving. They used artificial means to create some mud and grass and added some artificial hills and small bodies of water, playing in the courtyard. Later, some people felt there was an opportunity to be seized, so they greatly embellished it and innovated the designs. The American temperament has always been to follow the crowd, and one person's singing is met with a hundred voices in harmony. Thus, miniature golf became a new fad.</p>
<p>The Reasons for the Development of Miniature Golf: Big golf is expensive and time-consuming. Only wealthy sons and gentlemen have the money and time to play. The average American goes to work early in the morning and doesn't return until five in the afternoon. After a short rest, it is already late. Naturally, they don't have time to play. Miniature golf can be played indoors, regardless of day or night, and it is not affected by wind or rain. It also doesn't take much time. No wonder everyone is flocking to it.</p>
<p>The Situation of Miniature Golf in the United States: According to a survey in August of last year, there were 25,000 miniature golf courses in the United States. The equipment cost for each course was approximately $5,000, with a total investment of $125 million. The average revenue for each course is $200 per day. That means the capital is earned back after one month. Many companies specialize in building artificial golf courses for people's homes, with each piece ranging from $12 to $50. Many young people prefer playing miniature golf to going to the movies. Therefore, some movie theaters with sluggish business have been converted into miniature golf courses. Some large shipping companies have also added this entertainment option to attract passengers.</p>
<p>The Miniature Golf Fever in Shanghai: Since miniature golf flowed into Shanghai from the United States, everyone is vying to imitate it. Playing miniature golf has also become one of the conditions of being modern. There is one course in Shanghai's western district that uses electricity to control caves and bridges. The cave doors open and close, and the drawbridges are raised and lowered. You have to hit the ball when the cave door is open and the drawbridge is down to pass. Although it is more difficult, it is very interesting and can be considered a novel approach.</p>
<h3 id="e184">A Visit to Buddhist Doctor Hu <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Tang Xueqing</p>
<p>The traditional Chinese medicine doctor Hu Tianxiang, styled Fo, hails from Wuling. He possessed extraordinary intelligence from a young age and could recite anything after seeing it once. He enjoyed studying Buddhist principles and was diligent and tireless. His footprints have practically covered all the major temples in the country. He received the art of medicine from a remarkable person. His prescriptions were effective against ailments. In his prime, he traveled to Shanghai and settled there. Wang Yiting, a prominent figure in Shanghai, admired his reputation and invited him to discuss Chan Buddhism. Hu's words contained profound Chan principles, which greatly impressed Wang. Wang is also a steadfast supporter of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Hu is not only skilled in pulse diagnosis and deeply versed in Buddhism, but he also excels in poetry. At the fiftieth anniversary celebration of Yu Qiaqing, I witnessed a hanging scroll personally written and calligraphed by Hu. Both the writing and calligraphy were exquisite and possessed a unique style. My son, Manqian, suffered from stage II tuberculosis. He consulted Hu, and within ten days, his condition improved from severe to mild, and then to complete recovery. Recently, Xiaoqian fell ill again. As a three-year-old toddler who is just learning to speak, it was difficult to ascertain his condition. Therefore, I accompanied him to Hu's residence on Xiangshan Road in Zhabei to seek treatment. This was my first visit to Hu. Upon entering the room, I saw that the four walls were adorned with a dazzling array of books and paintings. The Buddhist statues on the central table were all masterpieces by famous artists. Hu was humble, courteous, and emphasized that patients should eat vegetarian food because vegetables are rich in nutrients, which are incomparable to meat. Moreover, during the summer months, if one can avoid meat and eat vegetarian food, one can avoid all seasonal illnesses. I have been a vegetarian for ten years and have never suffered from minor illnesses. This is the reason. As for Mr. Fei's illness, he should chant "Amitabha Buddha" more often. This is because his illness is caused by excessive mental exertion and neurasthenia. Those who engage in writing often rack their brains and are prone to this condition. If one chants the Buddha's name more often, one will only know Buddha in their mind's eye and nothing else, which can avoid many worries. His illness will not be difficult to cure suddenly. Many people say that I believe in Buddha and make others believe in Buddha. This is actually a misunderstanding of my views. I heard these words and affirmed them again and again. I thanked him with Xiaoqian and left. (He did not accept any payment.)</p>
<p>Brief News: Recently, someone in Hankou has raised a large amount of capital to establish a department store called Xinhua Company. It will be no less than Sincere &amp; Co. and Wing On in Shanghai. Inside, there will be a Lingxiao Amusement Park, which will be grand in scale and filled with a variety of performances. Recently, special representatives Yao Youbang and Li Feishu have been sent to Shanghai to invite performers. All the famous performers in Shanghai are being recruited. It is said that the grand opening will be on August 1st of the lunar calendar.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Americans and Indians have very good feelings. We are planning two Asia sports, namely the Asia culture and the America peace sports also. China can be a matchmaker. Let Asia spirit culture and America material culture marry and produce new Pacific Ocean Taiping (peace) culture. According to earth's fate, start from Euphrates River region, to Hilla Rome France England all of Europe. Cross Atlantic and prosperity to America, also cross Pacific and prosperity to Japan China and Thailand and India Arab. Now Pacific Ocean is right at its emperor transport also. Future will make the oldest India-ization. Confronting with newest American-ization. China is its connection wire, since from Shanghai to America and India. All are two and a half weeks’ journey also. This both Asia universe sport becomes chemistry (成化), not even to global superpower, but second major battle can be stopped also. Stuttering wants to visit China Japan. Because all Indian people I met, knowledgeable ones, without hope China-India cooperation and Asia-ization alliance. To revive East culture also. I say Indian people have several thousand years of first-class colony. And do not know how to use well also. Europe colonizes in possession places. And Indian colonizes in hearts. All Buddha followers are his colonies. If can be alliance. Global can be changed. What condition even less India? This is the time also. Shamis speaks I am believer of Buddha. But using scientific comparison method. India short fall is in class system. Buddha's short fall is in complimenting power and rich people. But Russia all-in teaches rich people. Also falls karma. In the future must choose a best road. To build a global garden. To give up killing and love then can be.</p>
<p>I was in India. The doctor I met as many as trees, great religious knowledge as sea. Life orders flourishing. Has to stand out West people on top of trend. Should the new trend movement grow day by day. The future of India cannot be measured. India people underestimate Jesus. Student say to me Jesus son of a carpenter. What does he know. Our India teach people cannot with other teach people eat also. I say you do not know Jesus. Try to check four gospels. Not one says complimenting capitalists. So camels if can pass needle nose. Capitalists also no rising sky expectation. Know Jesus civilian movement. Not like Buddha smooth talk. But rich people hate Jesus also. Therefore be on cross. Jesus not lightly evaluated also. And student deep evil class system. Wishes to change teach Buddha. Ask me how to relieve class system. I tell him to pull good student have big movement. Abolish class system. Can communicate and cooperate.</p>
<p>From Europe war after. India people joins Europe war. Knowledge highly opened. India often has to make handguns, bombs. Also with government and India detectives kill each other. Not really no resistance.</p>

<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>After dropping off the guest at the station, he didn't take any other business and pulled the rickshaw home. The young apprentice kept chattering about Xiao Rong, insisting that he hadn't mistaken anyone. He talked so much that Xiao Rong's father finally couldn't help but believe him, and he could only sigh deeply.</p>
<p>When he got home, he told his family about it. Xiao Rong's wife finally remembered and said, "Father, it must be Xiao Rong! I saw him at the station too, with a woman. But I was confused at the time and thought I was mistaken, so I let it go. Now, hearing what the apprentice said, everything is clear." She almost cried as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Could it really be Xiao Rong? He only left the day before yesterday. How could he be back today, and with a beautiful woman? Who is she? Who is she? I think maybe it's not really Xiao Rong," Xiao Rong's mother said, still somewhat doubtful.</p>
<p>"How could it not be Xiao Rong! He even spoke to me!" the apprentice said.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's father was really angry. By this time, he also believed that the person sitting in his rickshaw just now was Xiao Rong. So he told the apprentice to hurry to the railway hotel and call Xiao Rong home.</p>
<p>The apprentice obeyed the order and went. When he got to the railway hotel, he first looked at the water sign but couldn't find the name Lu Xiao Rong. He had to ask the cashier and the people inside, "A man and a woman, who came from Shanghai today, in which room are they?" he asked.</p>
<p>"What a joke! There are so many men and women from Shanghai! How do I know which one you're looking for? What's the surname? What's the name?" the cashier said with a smile.</p>
<p>"The surname is Lu, the name is Xiao Rong!" the apprentice only knew this much.</p>
<p>"There isn't one! There are no guests with the surname Lu today!" the cashier replied, glancing roughly at the register.</p>
<p>The apprentice had no choice but to go back and report. The whole family could only feel puzzled and had no idea what to do. Later, Xiao Rong's mother came up with an idea. She told the apprentice to get up early the next morning and wait at the entrance of the railway hotel. Since he was staying inside, he would definitely come out. When he came out, he could pull him home.</p>

<p>Favorable Environment, Optimistic Market Sentiment: Yesterday, the 10th, the gold speculation market was extremely active, progressing smoothly, almost soaring. There was a difference of twenty-four taels between the morning and afternoon markets, but the advance was rapid and the retreat was slow, with retracements of only two or three taels. In the end, it unexpectedly soared by twenty-six taels. The opening was high from the morning, due to the silver market decline (9th telegram). Fearing a continued decline in the silver market due to the sharp drop in foreign cotton, the industry generally held a downward outlook. Most short sellers actively covered their positions. It is rumored that foreign speculators also chased the price higher. As a result, the market price trended higher. When exchange rates both spot and forward became firm, and the quoted prices repeatedly narrowed, traders aggressively bought. By noon, the 770 tael mark had been broken. The market felt even more sharp. With the overview of 10,000 horses galloping, buyers were particularly strong, suddenly reaching a high of 780 taels.

<h3 id="e191">A New Atmosphere of Calm in the Money Market <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was Monday. Banks were open, and the financial market atmosphere was generally better than usual. Furthermore, the money shops were particularly busy with settlements due every ten days. All kinds of procedures were exceptionally busy, and the combination of these two factors made the situation quite prosperous, boosting the market atmosphere. As for the interest rates, they remained flat, but due to other needs for capital, there was a significant possibility of progress in the money market.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: (Foreign Interest) The opening market interest rate was 7 mace, 2 fen, 5 li, 1 hao, 2 si, and a half. The afternoon market was 7 mace, 2 fen, 5 li, and 2 hao and a half, only about 2 hao and a half better than the previous day's market price. (Silver Interest) The opening market was 1 fen, 1 li, and the afternoon market was 1 fen, 4 li. Due to tighter collateral for head money transactions, there was an appearance of 1 fen, 2 li, and 3 si. Bank quotes also had 4 fen in the market.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: There were no transactions in the Jiangnan small silver dollar market, so the price was the same as the previous afternoon, remaining at a blank bid of 6 mace, 4 fen, and 9 li and a half. The opening market for Guangdong small silver dollars was 6 mace, 4 fen, and 5 li and a half, and the afternoon market was 6 mace, 4 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao and a half, slightly down by half a li and 7 hao and a half compared to the previous day. The volume of transactions was 145,000 jiao in the morning and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins weakened by 1,500 wen, to 377,500 wen, with over 27,000 strings transacted.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Yesterday, the banks were quite busy with settlements. Chinese merchants settled over 4.1 million taels, foreign merchants settled 3.3 to 3.4 million taels, special settlements amounted to 3 to 4 million taels, and collateral transactions exceeded 1 million taels. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items settled over 11 million taels, with 1.2 million taels going into storage and 600,000 taels leaving. Japanese banks settled over 7.3 million taels in various items, with special settlements exceeding 1 million taels and 800,000 taels going into storage. Due to the settlement period, the money shops' and silver firms' single settlements were particularly large, totaling over 65.5 million taels. Silver head money settlements amounted to over 4.7 million taels, remittances from various routes were over 1.4 million taels, and cash disbursements were over 1 million taels. (Foreign Currency) Remittance drafts made 1.715 million in the morning and 1.645 million in the afternoon. Banknotes made 72,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknotes made 185,000 in the morning and 130,000 in the afternoon. Foreign exchange between banks made 650,000 in the morning and 450,000 in the afternoon. Bank foreign currency account settlements were over 1.8 million, with banknote withdrawals and issuances of 3.3 to 3.4 million. Money shops' foreign currency settlements exceeded 13 million, foreign currency head money settlements were over 2.2 million, foreign currency lending and borrowing were over 1.8 million, small money shops' transactions exceeded 800,000, and inter-bank transactions were over 300,000.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Importers' Payment of Sterling Bills <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>According to financial circles, the money market may continue to rise. Yesterday, a large batch of sterling settlements was due, and the settlement of other large bills and various exchange transactions required a large amount of capital. Furthermore, the amount of foreign rice settlement was also significant. Even if there is not much speculation in the market, the circulation of head money will inevitably be tight. Although bank collateral has an appearance of being flexible, if the money market tightens, it may not be as desired. Therefore, it is predicted that the future money market, even if it does not rise sharply, will certainly not be as flat and loose as it used to be.</p>

<p>The Trend Continues Flat, with 20.5 Million Transacted</p>
<p>Yesterday, bond transactions saw a variety of spot goods open, but transactions continued to be low. In the futures market, large accounts sold off early in the morning, and bond prices fell sharply. Issues such as the 19th-year Customs bonds, the Good Debt, and the 20th-year Consolidated Tax bonds all fell by more than one yuan. Afterwards, each market hovered and strengthened, but the final result was a continued decline across the board compared to last weekend. Futures for issues such as the Disbandment bonds, the 19th-year Customs bonds, and the Consolidated Tax bonds, as well as the 20th-year Customs bonds for August, all fell by about 7 or 8 jiao. Other issues also saw small declines of a few jiao. Only the spot price of the Disbandment bonds fell by more than one yuan, while the spot price of the Reorganization bonds rose by several yuan compared to late last month. In addition, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange stock rose by 7 jiao. The total value of futures transactions for the entire day reached 20.05 million yuan, while spot transactions were only 9,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Yarn and Cotton: An Extraordinary Price Drop Occurs in the Yarn Market <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>This is a Reaction to the Drastic Changes in the World Cotton Industry</p>
<p>The yarn market has collapsed. A large increase in U.S. cotton production has caused the price of third-grade yarn to plummet by 13 yuan. Local market prices are higher than those in the past, and long positions are limited by quantity but not by price. As a result, selling orders are being shouted out loud. However, many small investors are entering the market because the price drop is too severe. Future demand is not expected to be very high because the floods in various regions are too severe, and farmers have less purchasing power. Therefore, those who are watching the global situation are still selling. However, some large merchants are making near-term sales and far-term purchases due to the rising gold prices, and they are taking a neutral position. It is feared that the 50 tael mark for local yarn will be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Falls by More Than 5 Taels: At the opening of the People's Standard yarn market, the news of the deteriorating external cotton market caused many sellers to rush to sell, and Japanese merchants also sold. The price drop in each month was particularly severe, with each falling by 5 taels, 5 qian to 6 taels. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere calmed slightly due to the slight increase in gold prices, and prices rebounded by 3, 4, or 5 qian. The total volume of transactions was 94,000 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 4,400 bales, Hengde sold 3,550 bales, Gengfeng sold 3,100 bales, Minghua sold 1,150 bales, Taixing sold 1,650 bales, Shenglong sold 2,850 bales, Dafeng sold 1,400 bales, and Meiji sold 1,850 bales. Xincheng bought 5,750 bales, Yiyu bought 3,650 bales, Fuhe bought 4,000 bales, Ruidai bought 4,700 bales, Yudai bought 3,900 bales, and Dafu bought 1,750 bales. The closing prices of People's Standard yarn are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance: Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>August 154.7 Down 4.6 50,900 November 153.0 Down 5.0 91,000</p>

<p>October 152.3 Down 5.2 92,550 January 153.8 Down 5.4 38,050</p>
<p>Current Sales are Mediocre: Spot yarn transactions are very slow. However, the Yunnan group purchased more than 1,000 bales of near-term futures. It was found that all groups purchased 1,750 bales of futures and spot goods throughout the day, with fellow merchants purchasing 250 bales. Prices fell by 3 li or 2. The customer groups purchased 360 bales to the interior, 35 bales to Changsha, 30 bales to the Northern group, 1,300 bales to Yunnan, and 25 bales to Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Cotton Market Plummets <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Situation is Perilous... Selling is Unusually Strong</p>
<p>According to official reports, U.S. cotton production is 15,584,000 bales. The December contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is at 6.8 cents, a sharp drop of 137 points. It is expected that the New York market price will collapse tomorrow, which is inevitable. Therefore, the market is extremely fearful. On the same day, Japanese merchants and Dongmian foreign firms sold a huge amount of 50,000 to 60,000 dan at market prices, and the market plummeted. However, some local merchants believe that the floods in various regions are severe, the weather is unfavorable, and there may be unrest. Also, gold prices are soaring, so they are still unwilling to close out their positions. Indian and American cotton foreign firms are selling at discounted prices at various factories, which are 6 to 7 taels lower than the previous day. However, the factories are aware that the world trend is unstable, so they have no intention of purchasing.</p>
<p>Han Standard Cotton Drops by 1 Tael, 6 or 7 Qian: At the opening of the Han Standard cotton market, the news of the unfavorable external cotton market and the sharp drop in the price of Japanese third-grade yarn by 4 Japanese yuan caused Japanese merchants in the market to sell in large quantities. Panic reached its peak, and prices in each month fell by 1 tael, 6, 7, or 8 qian to 2 taels. In the afternoon, prices rose by 1 or 2 qian, 5 fen in each month as gold prices strengthened. The total volume of transactions was 294,700 dan. It was found that Tianlong sold 12,000 dan, Gongtai sold 13,200 dan, Gengfeng sold 28,200 dan, Shenji sold 12,100 dan, Changfeng sold 8,200 dan, and Hengda sold 4,200 dan. Ruidai bought 13,600 dan, Xinheng bought 8,400 dan, Xincheng bought 10,200 dan, Yiyu bought 7,100 dan, Yuande bought 4,300 dan, Xiesheng bought 4,100 dan, Xinfeng bought 4,800 dan, and Dafu bought 3,900 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Rice brand "Te Ling" 37.5 and brand "Di Zhen Xin" factory entered 200 lots of spot goods to the warehouse.</p>

<p>True High-Quality White Japonica Rice Opens at 19 Yuan in Secret Market</p>
<p>Wangdian New Early Indica Rice Opens at 14 Yuan, 4 Jiao</p>
<p>South Market: The origin of various groups is approximately 5 to 6 days away, and there are few river stocks. Sales in urban and rural stores are seeing a shortage of goods. However, sellers are holding onto their goods and selling them because yesterday's prices were not satisfactory, and the market is tense. Transactions have increased. Later, after the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to implement price limits, people felt slightly calmer. Therefore, the prices of various goods are still being evaluated automatically, and they are 5 jiao higher than yesterday. The situation is bound to improve further as goods remain scarce and sales are active. However, the situation may be slightly worse after the evaluation. Yesterday, 40 shi of Dongxin japonica rice arrived, and sales were still good, with the price opening at 16 yuan and a half. Over 100 shi of Wangdian new early rice arrived from the previous day, and the price opened at 14 yuan and 4 jiao. Foreign rice goods are still scarce, and Hanban continues to move, making the market even stronger.</p>
<p>New Gate: Very few goods arrive from the interior. Transactions on this street are not very prosperous. Furthermore, it is heard that there are floods in various places, making people even more nervous. Because the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to limit prices, the highest price of white japonica rice cannot exceed 17 yuan. Recently, there has been a lack of accumulation in the river, which is actually due to the customer's investment. Special goods with three [unclear characters] are offered at 19 yuan, and the shopkeepers pay 2 yuan per shi. Northern japonica rice, thin rice, foreign pointy rice, reed pointy rice, and pier pointy rice have each risen by 7 or 8 jiao. Yesterday, 2 bundles of glutinous rice arrived and were sold out immediately, with the market tending to tighten by 2 jiao. The new japonica rice is similar to that in the southern market.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Flour Price Rises Sharply by 4 and a Half Fen <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly saw a huge surge. The reason for the excitement is that since the floods in various places, grain prices have gradually skyrocketed. Recently, flour and wheat have been relatively inexpensive. Therefore, after the opening price, the Yangtze River, the inland, and various groups are rushing to buy without price limits. This month's highest price has soared to 2 taels, 1 qian, 6 fen and a half, September to 2 taels and 2 qian, October to 2 taels, 2 qian and 3 fen, November to 2 taels, 2 qian, 4 fen and a half, December to 2 taels and 2 qian and a half, and January to 2 taels, 2 qian and 4 fen, which are all 5 to 6 fen higher than the previous day's closing price. However, the Tianjin group and factories are selling back in large quantities, so the price has fallen back by 2 or 3 fen in the middle, but it has rebounded again due to the strong demand. The total volume of transactions in the city has reached 2.5 to 2.6 million, which seems to be a new record. In the future, it is necessary to see the extent of the floods in order to predict the intentions of the inland groups. As a result, this month's price is 2 fen, 7 li and a half higher than the previous week, September's price is 3 fen, 7 li and a half higher, October's price is 4 fen and a half higher, and November to January are each 4 fen and 2 li and a half higher.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Wheat Market Sees Strong Buying Interest <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Near-Term Prices Surge by 1 Qian, 2 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a continuous surge. Although foreign wheat prices had small fluctuations of 2, 3, 4, or 5 jiao, the inland Yangtze River group believed that the floods were extremely severe. Although there were large quantities of foreign wheat scheduled, it was feared that they would not be enough to compensate for the losses caused by the floods. Furthermore, the exchange rate was also shrinking, and the future was bleak. There was a strong momentum to continue the surge. Therefore, buying interest was strong and unstoppable. Given this situation, it would not be surprising if prices rise further. As a result, this month's price is 1 qian, 2 fen higher than the previous week, September's price is 1 qian, 1 fen higher, October's price is 9 fen higher, and November and December's prices are 7 fen higher. Because spot wheat is scarce, the highest quality has been priced at 4 taels, 8 qian and 2 fen, an average increase of about 4 or 5 fen. It is estimated that 2,400 bales of Zhenjiang, Yizheng, Taicang, Penglai, Wusong, Zhichang, Kunshan, Anqing, Pudong, and Chongming wheat were handled by Huafeng and Fuxin.</p>

<p>Nearly 10,000 Bags of Spot Coarse Granulated White Sugar Open</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still no reports from sugar-producing areas. In the public market, prices rose because of the sudden increase in the exchange rate, and the market atmosphere strengthened. Transactions were active, and prices rose gradually. Dutch sugar 24-grade coarse granulated white sugar was priced from 11 taels, 3 qian and a half to 4 qian and a half.

<h3 id="e203">North and South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Rise Due to Floods <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Recently, black melon seeds have seen price increases because there have been floods in the producing areas, and the harvest is bound to be poor. The market trend is strong. Current market prices for first-grade goods such as Jizhong seeds are 17 taels, middle-grade goods such as Xukui seeds are 14 taels and a half, and lower-grade goods such as Dalian seeds are 11 taels to 10 taels. In recent days, groups from Changsha, Fuzhou, and Shantou have been purchasing a lot of lower-grade goods. Because the new goods are scarce, various firms are unwilling to sell much of their inventory, so prices may rise again in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e226">An Introduction to Social Sciences <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>By Mei Yonggeng</p>
<p>Written by Guo Renyuan</p>
<p>The rise of social sciences is only a matter of the last few decades. Nowadays, in Chinese writing circles, treatises on social sciences are emerging like a storm. Many of them are specialized studies of this emerging science.</p>
<p>The book I am going to introduce to readers now is Guo's "An Introduction to Social Sciences".</p>
<p>Social science is a collection of various sciences that study the various phenomena of social life and seek their theorems and laws. The organization of human groups themselves, political activities, and economic activities all have very complex ties. In China today, when the tide of the Great Revolution is surging and destroying the inherent social organization, a kind of unrest is appearing in society. Of course, we should find methods of self-rescue in the social sciences.</p>
<p>In the human social life of the twentieth century, connections with each other are becoming increasingly close. The rise and fall of gold prices in the United States can affect the life of a small peasant family in inland China. In short, since the economic organization has formed a global system, from national political wars to people's daily lives of food and drink, men and women, there are close relationships. The phenomenon where moving one hair affects the whole body is the real phenomenon of today's society. We should find solutions to all these problems in the social sciences.</p>
<p>We also know that revolution is two-sided. One side is political and economic, while the other is the removal of the inherent and decadent thoughts in the minds of the masses. The former can generally be said to have been completed after the National Revolutionary Army unified the country, while the latter is the work of the period of political tutelage, which is being implemented but has not yet achieved considerable results. The only way to remedy this is to make efforts to instill knowledge of contemporary social science to the general public so they can understand the current political, economic, and social conditions and strive for new creations.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of Guo's Introduction to Social Sciences lies in his use of a mixed method to edit, so that beginners know that social phenomena are interrelated. The author says in the preface:</p>
<p>"...Social life is originally a whole and complete entity, but this phenomenon is extremely complex. People divide society into several kinds for the convenience of research. However, this kind of classification is most unsuitable for beginners, because it is feared that beginners cannot understand the integrity and wholeness of social phenomena. This book, in order to avoid this danger, uses a mixed method to edit..."</p>
<p>That's right, the learning of social science is like the boundless and shoreless sea. Beginners often only see fragments and independent parts of social phenomena, and do not know that political, economic, legal, and other phenomena are interrelated and interact with each other, and are not independent of each other. This book can give readers a holistic concept of social phenomena.</p>
<p>Secondly, the advantage of this book lies only in talking about the facts of social life, and avoiding academic discussions as much as possible. The author focuses on narrating social life, rarely participating in any opinions, or making any claims. I feel that scholars who write social science books will inevitably make beginners feel lost in a fog if they focus on academic theories. Therefore, beginners should read books that focus on facts. This book is a book that focuses on the facts of social life and avoids academic discussions as much as possible. This is another advantage of this book.</p>
<p>This book is an introductory book to social science, so its content only makes a concise description, which is most suitable for general beginners.</p>

<p>World Economy and Industrial Rationalization: The current world economic panic is a major issue that agitates the whole world. Therefore, all countries are trying to save it. Mr. Zeng Guangxun, the editor of Social Magazine, has seen this, and has written the book World Economy and Industrial Rationalization based on his research, so as to provide a common study. The book is divided into two parts. The upper part describes the general situation of the world economy, from the development of productivity to the occurrence of the world economic panic, and then to the demise of capitalism. The lower part describes the essence of industrial rationalization, and clearly explains the actual situation of the rationalization movement in various countries. The book has a very detailed description of the world economy and the Chinese economy in 1930. It also describes in detail the important issues in the world economic community in the first half of 1931, such as the German-Austrian customs union and the Hoover debt extension plan. Looking at the whole book, the materials are rich and novel, and the judgment is clear and correct. It is a book that those who study the world economy and care about China's economic construction issues must read. The book has been printed and will be published soon. To request a sample copy, you can write to Social Magazine at No. 155, Yonganli, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai, and it will be sent to you.</p>
<p>The Liming Bookstore on Wangping Street, Four Horse Road, recently published a book on the Principles and Practices of Accounting, written by American accounting expert Frank H. Strieghthoff, and jointly translated by Li Mingshou and Zhang Zhongliang. The original book is used as a textbook in various specialized schools and above in the United States. Two Chinese accounting experts, Pan Xulun and economic expert Li Quanshi, have highly praised it in their prefaces, so its value can be known. For all major middle schools that use textbooks for the accounting subject, this book is most suitable. The bureau also published a book on vocational education, written by Xiong Zirong. This book elaborates on the theory and methods of vocational education, as well as the problems of vocational guidance in primary and secondary schools. It can be used as a textbook for general vocational schools, and a good reference book for those who study vocational education.</p>

<h3 id="e228">An Eighty-Five-Year-Old Female Reporter <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Mrs. Alice Van Sickle of Ohio, USA, is the oldest and most active female reporter in the United States. She is already eighty-five years old this year, but she is still very enthusiastic about this profession. Many of her words and deeds are very interesting and worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>She is now a reporter for five newspapers in Ohio. She also reports news on the radio every week. The ears of thousands of housewives can often hear her voice. She also writes articles for the prisoners' newspaper and often goes to talk to prisoners.</p>
<p>She lives in a simple little house in Covington. She is busy all day long, so her back is bent, she walks with a cane, and her hair has turned white, but her eyes are still bright.</p>
<p>She is indeed a talented journalist. She wrote a love story at the age of fourteen and published it in a weekly, and from then on she began her lifelong career.</p>
<p>After she got married, many other things took away her time and energy, and life was uneasy, almost interrupting her lifelong career, but because of her firm will, it never stopped.</p>
<p>She has often helped others throughout her life, helping her father, helping her sick husband to support the family, and taking care of housework. Once, the owner of a newspaper was attacked because he owed wages, and she helped him work day and night. She was the first woman to join the American Printing Industry Union.</p>
<p>She has published a lot about her philosophy of age.</p>
<p>She said, "Whether men or women, after middle age, they are always unwilling to continue to pursue the success they did not get in their early years. This is not because of the loss of their physical or mental strength, but because their desires are less than before, and their goals are gradually weakened. In fact, the rewards obtained from the loss of physical and mental strength, 丨丨rich experience, correct judgment, and mature intelligence, 丨丨are sometimes more than lost."</p>
<p>"The difficulty is that after the age of forty-five or fifty, many people are unwilling to try again. They have no intention of doing things that they are still capable of doing, so they stop working, they admit weakness, and they get old. The reason why I can maintain my youth is entirely because I continue to work. This is undoubtedly."</p>
<p>In the 1929 Ohio Women Journalists Association, her article won first prize. She said, "If you are willing to work for a long time, you will definitely be successful. The reason why I was able to get the first prize this time is because I have spent sixty years of effort on this path."</p>
<p>She has devoted herself to a writing career for 70 years, but she still has no intention of retiring. She said, "If you think you are satisfied with the career you have achieved, then of course you can retire. If you are not satisfied with what you have achieved, then why do you want to retire? It is best to continue to work hard."</p>
<p>She also said, "Old age is not only happier than younger age, but also more interesting and more successful. Age is an asset. It makes me understand life."</p>
<h3 id="e229">China's Silk Exports Decrease Significantly <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Due to Poor Spring Cocoon Harvest</p>
<p>According to investigations, this year's exports of Chinese raw silk have decreased by 62% for Shanghai silk and 52% for Guangdong silk compared with the same period last year. That is, from June 1st to July 19th, Shanghai silk, including machine silk and Qili silk, totaled 8,012 packages, while the same period last year was 20,428 packages. The reason is due to the poor spring cocoon harvest. Factors such as fluctuations in the silver market and the decline in the price of Japanese silk had little impact. Also, Guangdong silk (from May 1st to July 15th) this year was 8,599 packages, compared to 18,787 packages last year. The reasons for the decrease are that the quality is not good and consumers are not very welcome, and the price of Japanese silk is low.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Research on Ash-Made Fuel <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Adopted by the Japanese Railway Bureau</p>
<p>According to a Japanese report, the fuel used for fire maintenance in each locomotive in the Japanese National Railway Bureau's engine depot has long been a problem. Now the Nagoya engine depot has made fuel for fire maintenance from Kinta (incompletely burned powder of coal) which used to be a problem on the disposal site. That is, briquettes made by mixing 70% Kinta, 20% powder of the first kind of briquettes used by various specialized locomotives, and 10% clay, have been adopted since the beginning of June. The engine depot has many locomotives assigned to it, and the average daily savings is about 900 yuan by using waste instead of coal. The Nagoya Railway Bureau plans to purchase a briquette manufacturing machine immediately and start large-scale manufacturing. The entire bureau uses about 100,000 yuan per year. If all the bureaus across the country adopt it, it can save more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e231">US Unemployment to Reach 7 Million <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Conditions this Winter May Be Worse than Last Winter - President Hoover is Discussing Relief Methods</p>
<p>Washington News: The American Federation of Labor announced that the number of unemployed workers increased again in July. It is expected that the number of unemployed people in the United States will reach 7 million this winter. Also, the employment index in July was 18.9, June was 18.2, and May was 17.1. Federation President Green said, "If the number of unemployed people increases as usual, there will be 7 million people without work this winter, and the unemployment situation this winter will definitely be worse than last winter. The National Community Treasury Association's survey of unemployment in 184 cities predicts that relief expenses will have to be doubled from last winter." Green urged immediate engagement in relief.</p>
<p>Another report: Washington officials expect that the trend of salary reductions in the American industry this winter will become a widespread phenomenon. Relief methods are still being discussed. President Hoover specially summoned Red Cross President Payne to the White House to discuss methods of cooperation between various charitable organizations. According to Payne's observation, the unemployment situation is not very bad, and this winter may not be worse than last winter.</p>

<p>The Deficit Reaches Over 5 Trillion Francs - The Industry is Greatly Disturbed</p>
<p>Paris News: According to the Director-General of Taxation, France's foreign trade deficit continues to increase sharply. In the first five months of this year, imports totaled 19,287,549,000 francs, and exports totaled 1373,910,000 francs. The deficit reached 5,565,639,000 francs. The French industry is greatly worried about this. In February and March of this year, French exports were still considered stable, but they suddenly fell in May. The import price for that month was 3,574,706,000 francs, and the export price was 2,438,165,000 francs. The deficit reached 1,136,541,000 francs. Also, in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period last year, imports decreased by 3,383,000 francs and exports decreased by 5,528,000 francs.</p>

<p>Ranked in Order: US, UK, France, Germany, Canada</p>
<p>According to a survey by the British Automobile Manufacturers and Sales Association, the United States still ranks first in the number of cars in the world, followed by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada. The survey by the association is based on the figures for the past year (1930), including pedal cars. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>United States: 26,746,184 vehicles</p>
<p>United Kingdom: 1,484,92 vehicles</p>
<p>France: 1,322,387 vehicles</p>
<p>Germany: 688,633 vehicles</p>
<p>Canada: 1,179,817 vehicles</p>
<h3 id="e234">Foch's Diary of the European War by a French General <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>I intend to submit the following plan (July 24, 1918):</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The German army's fifth offensive since the start of the war was thwarted, resulting in complete failure.</p>
<p>The French Tenth and Sixth Armies took the offensive and defeated the German army.</p>
<p>Our army must take advantage of this victory and pursue relentlessly with all its strength. The impact of this will far exceed the significance of this particular battle.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The enemy's defeat has become the basis for the Allied forces to plan their operational strategies.</p>
<p>The current situation of the enemy and our forces is as follows:</p>
<p>Our army has already achieved an equal number of troops to the enemy, but our army still does not have an advantage in the total number of divisions.</p>
<p>The German army, compelled by the situation, has had to mobilize so many divisions to fight. For the first time, our reserve forces have the upper hand. Furthermore, since the enemy has been forced to withdraw many exhausted divisions from the front lines for rest and recuperation, our army will also have the same advantage in the number of fresh reserve troops.</p>
<p>Moreover, all intelligence indicates that the enemy has divided its troops into two parts: one part with weak strength, used to hold the defensive line and dedicated to sacrifice; the other part stationed behind this weak defensive line, deploying response measures. Although this army has been carefully trained by the German High Command, its combat effectiveness has been greatly affected.</p>
<p>The Allied air force and tank artillery are also overwhelmingly superior. After the arrival of the American artillery corps, our army's strength in artillery will certainly be greatly increased.</p>
<p>Finally, in the rear of the Allied forces, 250,000 American troops arrive in France every month like a tide, becoming a powerful reserve force. On the enemy's side, we already know that he once adopted emergency measures to relieve the panic of troop replenishment in May. Now he is encountering even greater difficulties in maintaining the strength of the armies on the front lines, and signs of a new panic are emerging.</p>
<p>In terms of materials, our army is gradually gaining the upper hand. Since the start of the war, although the enemy has launched fierce attacks with unprecedented force, they have ultimately failed to achieve the decisive victory they needed to achieve. Our army has always been able to maintain morale, and now after the great victory, morale is even more invigorated.</p>
<p>The overall situation of the Great War has reached a turning point. The Allied forces have progressed to a position of turning danger into safety and changing from defense to offense. The Allied troop strength and operational doctrine allow it to maintain this offensive advantage.</p>
<p>The Allied forces have always been forced to adopt a defensive posture due to a lack of troops, and now the time has come to switch to an offensive stance. (To be continued)</p>
