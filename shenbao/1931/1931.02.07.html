<p>美總統以新稅則内所列木材麵粉猪皮毛帽及楓糖等物進口稅率過高。特以行政命令。布告减。削是即所謂總統有伸縮救濟之特權是也查美商次克林博士前爲解釋總統此項特權。曾由播音台發表一文。謂總統此項特權。並非能任意伸縮。須先經稅則委員會專家認可。亦非漫無限制。增减率不得逾原率百分之五十此次胡佛總統所减削各物稅率雖尚未能悉其詳數。惟以總統所有權限言之。恐其所减削。仍未能滿反抗各國之意也。此次美國之减削稅率。表面上雖謂爲顧念各友邦之便利。體恤各行商之困難然論其實際。自美國公布新稅則後。各國之表示反抗者。達四十餘國欲實施報復關稅者。首坎拿大。次西班牙。其他歐陸各國。亦有互相提携同築新稅璧壘之舉已與美國以多大不利。况美自工業不振後。交易所銀行界之風潮。連續不斷而來。國内貿易。愈無辦法。欲圖於商業上有所發展。惟有移轉對内之眼光以對外。</p>
<p>努力於物品之輸出競爭國外之市塲以爲最後之救濟倘於此時。他國亦以高稅相應付。則更非美國之利。此種情勢。類能見之。故美總統之減削稅率。雖出於總統行政之特權。然亦必非胡佛一人之意。所謂商務會之要人。稅則會之專家等。當亦同感此種高稅之實不宜於今日。故予總統以權宜而減削之也。</p>

<p>▲華僑敎育會長誓師</p>
<p>在爭此最後全數勝利、僑界有熱烈希望、故公推敎育會會長林西錦先生、於出發前往大本營、爲諸健兒慰勞、并勘勵有加、士心益爲之一振、於下午四時餘即浩浩蕩蕩馳赴前敵</p>
<p>▲敵方實力徒負空名</p>
<p>此次球員、以出席前屆遠東足球員爲基本、再挑選各校健將加入、以西班牙半種人爲多、個個威武、顯出有十二分戰鬥能力、故謂之全菲明星隊ALLStar敦知太陽一出、則羣星黯淡無光、</p>
<p>▲張我威武轉眼成功</p>
<p>時間旣到、　笛聲鳴、我軍迎日而陣、由戴中鋒撥球、統率全軍取左右包抄之勢、進攻敵門戴籃球飛奔知遠射敵必有備、故挑過敵方前衛後、即遠傳與符和萱、符盤數步後、再交與戴戴知敵將監視嚴密且知黑將軍緊適在後、故意漏球、黑將軍已默會機宜、急以左脚鈎射、球勢甚猛從右角飛入、其合作精神有如此、自數頃比賽以來、成功未有如是之速者、敵方鐵門檻</p>
<p>稱全菲名手、經此一擊槐對觀衆、連頭亦不敢高抬、旣稱明星隊、自然亦非易與、不因一擊失敗、致懈軍心前鋒秉開球之便、竭力反攻、均爲我方勇敢之二城守將馬二將軍與江善敬擊出、</p>

<p>▲評判員有不公嫌</p>

<p>吾鄉陳雅樓先生。生前業醫。其行醫也。無論貧富。無論遠近。不斤斤於診金之多寡。若爲赤貧之家。即屬外症。不受診金。不取藥資。若屬内症。有時且以病家購藥之資。煑藥之炭無着。處方之後。反與以資。令之購藥購炭。或見病家夏日無席。冬日無被者。更與以資。令之置席置被。其一生行醫。旣如是矣。故其一次大病。曾經死去數時。家人已辦衣衾棺具。而先生忽甦。自是益行善事。而晚年施診給藥之外。更於四鄉修築橋路。嘗以一人之力有限。糾集里中十二紳商。創爲同善善會。在會者每年合資造一石橋。期於十二年内造成十二石橋。以利四鄉出入。所惜功未及半。先生遽歸道山。不獲見其成功。先生僅具中人之産。而凡遇各地水旱災振。亦不惜傾囊助振。好行其德如此。此實難能而可貴者。先生於宣統辛亥年與一陸姓者。合資購得龔家路某姓之宅。遂於民國紀元之年。遷居於龔家路。其宅前面臨鎭。後則臨河。前後有兩堂。左右爲廂房。先生居於右廂。其左廂則由陸姓出租與人。蓋左廂爲陸姓産。右廂爲先生産。而前後兩堂。則兩姓合有焉。先生前年歸道山後。家人未爲營葬。停其柩於後堂。上月二十五晚。陸姓房客萬某。不戒於火。左廂火起。冒出屋頂。勢若燎原。當其起火時。風勢正對後堂。前堂旣盡在火中。後堂則又臨河。所停之柩。欲舁不得。家人正惶急間。而後堂亦已火起。遂聽其自然。詎知燒及後堂時。風勢本向西南者。至此風忽改向東南。旋轉不已。其火竟爲捲熄。事後檢之。則陸姓左廂盡燬。而前後兩堂。則但燒燬數椽。成一狹弄。先生之産與柩。均未損及。說者謂先生一生行善所致。是則佛說因果。固若可信者矣。</p>

<p>華清温泉。春寒賜浴。千古傳爲佳話。而南京湯山。自國都奠定後。以黨國要人之時相休沐於此。遂亦聞名於世。獨福州温泉。鮮有知者。余旅閩二年。時往就浴。爰記之以實自由談。</p>
<p>閩垣之東北門。曰湯門。即以湯泉得名。泉潛伏地中。沿湯門一帶。浴堂林立。率皆掘地爲井。泉汨汨出。如沸湯然。蒸氣氤氲。如釜上氣。井上設轆轤。挹　導管中。以入各室。水沸甚。以供浴。尚須冲冷水焉。至城南王莊南台一帶之浴室。則埋管於地爲暗渠以導之。計可五里許。而泉猶温。特裝置費頗鉅耳。</p>
<p>池之制。亦迥異滬上。分爲普通池個人池特别池。個人池約廿餘。甃以瓷磚。寛廣適可一人浴。深二尺許。注温泉滿。且一端砌如枕然。浴時偃臥泉中。浮沉上下。殊舒快適意。蓋泉爲天然之温泉。故其供應不吝。較滬上之所謂官盆洋盆者。尤舒適多多。至普通池則頗大。多人聚浴。取費甚廉。每人僅銅元十餘枚。以故中下級之就浴者頗多。</p>
<p>浴堂之精美者。以王莊之樂天泉爲最。特别池尤雅緻。紳商及機關中人物。咸就浴於是。並有理髮所餐館等設備。故賓朋遠來之洗塵。訴訟調解之密議等。每於浴堂中爲之。至若盛夏時一榻横陳。莫知昏夕。以浴堂爲納凉之所者。更比比也。王莊尚有海軍聯歡社。則軍政要人之特設。主席楊樹莊氏。海軍要人陳季良氏等。均常於此宴客聯歡焉。</p>
<p>客夏。湯門某家。曾有女浴堂之設。一切執役。均爲女傭。内容則非所詳悉。然若樂天泉等各大浴堂。亦因此而添設女座。浴室之一部。標有女浴室者。則禁門之内。吾輩不得越雷池一步矣。</p>

<p>這國技塲大約建於第二世紀或第三世紀初頁。在許多故籍中早已有人說及。但直到一八七○年才偶然發現。到一八八三年才完全發掘。我們單看這些光滑的石塊用堅固的士敏土一列一列的砌含着。便可推想到這是羅馬文明的標記。因爲當時居在巴黎的高盧民族還只有木材建築呢。這鬭技場的建築設計非常完備。那些石級可以坐一萬六千觀衆。場内有引導雨水的裝置。有容納猛獸的裝置等。設想的周到。雖二十世紀的頭腦亦有不及。當時在這露天舞台開演的遊藝有武士的鬭劍和獵狩。有江湖上流行的獸戲和各種小頑意。有簡單的通俗戲劇等。我們走進這鬭技場。可想像當日吕特絲的居民每逢佳節列坐在這些石級上對便於當時的劍士或俳優等鼓掌喝采的盛况。雖然二十步外的馬路上電車汽車像雷一般轟饗。但我們却儘可坐在這古劇塲的石座上作千年大夢。生活在現代生活裡面而憧憬着往古的文化。這樣閒情逸緻恐怕只有巴黎居民才最易得到罷。</p>
<p>現在這古鬭技場的上部平地上有一部份改作了一個小小的公園。佈置合宜。頗能减去一般古蹟通有的那種荒凉味道。小園外面四圍却是五六層樓的住屋。這樣更覺得把現社會和過去生活遺跡打成了一片。普通人多不注意到這些地方。所以狠難眞的認識巴黎。</p>
<p>人。其靈便處。實出人意想之外。現芝加哥農業委員會會長戈勃脫氏。HarveyWileyCorbett已囑白氏代爲製造此項玻璃房屋一所。欲以贈其夫人。大約於來年可以完工。白氏語人。謂不出十年。全世界人士。將咸改用此項玻璃房屋。故此後美國各中心地點。將設有大規模之房屋製造廠。專事製造種種玻璃住宅。製妥後。即分别運往各地銷售。如今日之汽車然云云。</p>

<h3 id="c189">蓺術界最近的意大利文壇薩味奥蒂與「回到傳統」運動汪倜然 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>意大利在文藝上向來是個派别最多、主義最多的國度、近代文學中的一些新主義、差不多都是發源於意大利的、但是發生得快、消滅得也快、因此意大利文學底潮流起伏、眞是柮變幻之奇觀、到了近年來、新的傾向因爲多而且亂、大家對於「新」的東西反而覺得乏味了、因此遂漸起了一種反動、這反動就是一個「回到傳統」的運動、是擯棄新的事好、要求舊的格律我傳統的一種「新」傾向、在現代文學上、這個傾向當然是「新」的、雖則它是回到古舊與傳統的、在西洋文學底、最近的表現上、這種傾向是顯明地可以看出的、而且多少帶着一點普遍的性質、在美國、是所謂「人文主義」（Humanism）、反對科學、反對一切新思想、而呐喊着回到古典與傳統去的、在英國、是小說家們底「回到傳統」這一派的小說家如華爾坡爾（HughWalpole）、泊利司脫萊（JBPriestly）等是重續英國小說（Novel）之傳統、在技術與格律上承襲維多利亞時代的精神、在題材與内容上、承襲狄更司的手法的、目前雄踞英國文壇而最受歡迎的就是這一派作品、此外、在意大利、就是上文所說的（回到傳統）的運動、這運動、在當前的意大利文壇、已經聲勢日漸浩大、有統御一切的趨勢、在小說方面、是推進了回到「古典主義」的傾向、在評壇上、是建定了意大利新興批評底中心、因此這含有反動意味的、要求規律與和諧的「回到傳統」運動、將使現代意大利文學底局面改變、是可以預言的、而且、由時代背景來看時、這反動也是個必然的現象、意大利在歐戰以後、因莫索里尼底當政、居然從飄摇憊疲的情態、達到暫時的小康之境、人民底生活有一部份當然由不安而穩定、這一種穩定的情狀、就産生耽於安樂和保守的心理、於是有一部份人就對於一切社會的活動、甚至文藝、都擯斥那抛棄傳統、擺脫規律去自由創造的新追求新努力、而要求有回到傳統、遵守規律的、因襲保守的設施或活動、因此、文學上的表現、新的東西是脫去傳統而獨立創造的、根基底薄弱和實質底空虚、在以前可以投合一般人底彷徨摸索、尋求新路的心理、在現在却已不能投合一般人底厭棄變革、貪圖安穩的心情、而這種心情、表現於文藝上的、就是最近意大利評壇底可以稱爲一回到傳統運動的一種反動、</p>
<p>成爲這運動的中心的是意大利底新興批評家幾諾薩味奥蒂（GinsSaviotti）薩味奥蒂是目前意大利文壇的一顆新出現的將星、據現在的推測、這一顆星對於意大利文學將來的命運、必然是很有關係的、</p>
<p>薩味奥蒂是一個熱那亞（Genoa）作家、熱那亞向來不以文藝著稱、但從薩味奥蒂以後、却頗有成爲意大利文藝中心之可能、米蘭、佛羅倫薩、羅馬、也許要比不上它了、事情是這樣的、去年春季、薩味奥蒂在熱那亞創辦了他的機關雜誌「徵象」（Indice）、這雜誌一出版之後、熱那亞就日漸成爲文藝界注目的新中心了、到了現在是、薩味奥蒂底影響已經遍佈全個意大利、并且逐漸增加其重要、</p>
<p>薩味奥蒂本來是個很有點聲名的作家、意大利底一些著名雜誌或評論上、常常有他的文意發表、但是、在一年多以前的時候、他覺得意大利文藝界底情態太糟了、其中一定出了毛病、於是他加以仔細的考察和研究、結果、他的結論是、意大利底民族文藝是染上了思想灰色的病症、因此他來對症下藥、他先寫下了他對於這件事的感想、印成一本十四頁的册子、題目呌「黨代文學·藝術·及批評概觀」、這篇宣言和他在「徵象」底最初幾期中所發表的文章、就彷彿是他的主義大綱、他的宣言開端這樣地說、丨</p>
<p>當代藝術底最普遍的特性是「唯腦主義」（Cerebralismo）、這是在那些窮於幻想而富於思想的時代中往往如此的、畫家、彫刻家、詩家、小說家們、因爲與外國的文藝常相接觸、是比以前更其意識到藝術底要求了、他們在新與舊之間彷徨着他們對於每陣的微風、只要是帶有能夠使空氣澄清的希望的、就拖住唯恐不及、因之他們是清淡過於實行、不去繪畫、彫刻、或著作、而只用顔色、石材、字眼等等去製造些理論、（但說得確切點、只是一些爭論、）他們只是尋求着一切新的與特創的、却忘了眞正的特創在於眞正藝術底生産、</p>
<p>這種概念主義和愛新狂是一切頽廢時期底特點、……我們可以藉以看出這情態的徵象就是、形式的技巧統御着内容、猶如華麗的衣飾之遮蔽着肺癆病身體底醜朽、有的是人、但是没有人性、只有腦、但是没有心、</p>
<p>這一段話可以說是薩味奥蒂底主文、以下他就竭力發揮這段意思、但我們要知道、他不是一個悲觀者、他不是以爲意大利文學是不可救藥的、他相信意大利文學之革新不但是必不可少、而且是就在眼前、</p>
<p>除了歌言意大利文學革新之必然性以外、薩味奥蒂接着就把意大利過去與現在的文學加以縝密的分析、並且推廣他的理論到劇塲、繪畫、彫刻、及詩語、此外還批評家們、到了結尾、他　宣佈的主張就是「回到傳統去」、但却旣不是新古典主義、亦不是新浪漫主義、更不是新心理寫實主義（Ｎeoverimc）、他的主張就是要文學家們重續意大利文學底傳統、而師法省馬·魏琪爾·但丁·等古典的作家、曼左尼（Manzoni）、李奥柏提（Leopordi）等浪漫派作家、和哥爾獨尼（Goldoni）凡爾加（Vergo）</p>
<p>但是、歸根一句話、他這種主張到底是什麽意思呢、他的意思就是、使藝術回到藝術、使藝術重新再走到文藝創造之永久的源泉、簡言之、就是、他重新肯定了那個簡單的大眞理、丨要産生藝術、必須要有藝術家、</p>

<p>Li, Zhang, and Bai Urged to be Given Titles for Overseas Travel</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wutong News: The resolution plan for the Guangxi situation involves Zhang and Gui having 25,000 troops, reducing 6,000 to 7,000, shrinking to ten divisions, with disbandment costs of about one million, to be issued by the Central Government. The troops will be under the command of Chen Jitang. One division of the Eighth Route Army will remain in Guangxi, with a six-month grace period, extendable to one year. After the grace period, the Eighth Route Army will return to Guangdong, and the New Sixteenth Division will also be transferred to Guangdong. Li, Zhang, and Bai will be given titles by the Central Government for overseas travel. Huang Shaoxiong will be the Director of Post-War Rehabilitation, and Wu will be the Chairman of Guangxi. All arrest warrants for former Guangxi generals will be revoked. It is heard that Li, Zhang, and Bai telegraphed Huang, requesting him to relay to the Central Government a request for travel expenses for their overseas travel to avoid those who spread rumors having a basis to do so.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang told reporters that regarding the post-war situation in the Southwest, the Central Government believes that Guangxi Province has suffered frequent war disasters, is dilapidated, and its military and political affairs urgently need to be handled as soon as possible. It was decided to send Huang Shaoxiong back to Guangxi with the title of Director of Post-War Rehabilitation to be responsible for handling it. Regarding the reorganization of the Guangxi army and the restoration and reorganization of politics, the Central Government will decide on a plan, task Huang Shaoxiong to proceed accordingly, and Li, Bai, and Zhang will leave the army and travel overseas together. Reports that battles have occurred in Nanning and Wuzhou and that looting and arson have taken place are incorrect. It is learned that troops of the Eighth Route Army are still stationed in Heng County, which is very close to Nanning. Military reports have arrived in Beijing for several days and have not mentioned this matter, which shows that the news is not accurate. (Sixth Day Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Number of Mongolian Representatives to the National Assembly <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Various Leagues and Banners Request an Increase</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has repeatedly received telegrams from various Mongolian leagues and banners, stating that the area is vast and the situation is special. In the First National Assembly, Mongolia had four representatives per league and two per special banner. In the Second National Assembly, Mongolia had two representatives per league and one per special banner. Even in the National Assembly convened by the previous government, Mongolia had two representatives per league and one per special banner. In this National Assembly, the entire Mongolian 18 leagues and 4 special banners have only 12 representatives, which is not enough to be allocated. Moreover, the feelings of the entire Mongolian people cannot be fully expressed. Please forward the matter to the Central Government, with the league and banner as the electoral body, and increase the number of representatives to at least three per league and one per special banner, totaling 58 people. Except for the outer Mongolian six leagues, it is feared that it will be difficult to elect representatives. In reality, there are only 40 representatives, which will benefit both the country and the local area. The Commission has reported the situation to the Executive Yuan for review and consideration.

<h3 id="e31">US President Reduces Tax Rates <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The US President, believing that the import tax rates listed in the new tariff laws for goods such as lumber, flour, pigskin hats, and maple sugar are too high, issued an executive order to reduce them. This is the so-called presidential power of flexible relief. Dr. Klimer, an American businessman, previously published an article explaining the President's power, stating that the President's power cannot be arbitrarily adjusted and must be approved by experts from the Tariff Commission, and is not without restrictions. The increase or decrease rate cannot exceed 50% of the original rate. Although the details of the tax rates reduced by President Hoover have not yet been fully ascertained, judging from the President's powers, it is feared that the reduction will still not satisfy the resistance of various countries. Although the US's reduction of tax rates is nominally said to be for the convenience of friendly nations and to sympathize with the difficulties of various merchants, in reality, since the US announced the new tariff laws, the number of countries expressing resistance has reached more than 40. Those who want to implement retaliatory tariffs include Canada and Spain. Other European countries have also taken steps to cooperate and build new tariff barriers, which have caused great disadvantages to the US. Moreover, since the US's industry has been sluggish, the waves in the stock exchange and banking circles have continued unabated, and there is no way to improve domestic trade. To develop commercially, the only way is to shift the internal perspective to external.</p>
<p>Efforts to export goods to compete for foreign markets will be the last resort. If other countries respond with high taxes at this time, it will be even more unfavorable to the US. This kind of situation can be seen. Therefore, although the US President's reduction of tax rates is based on the President's executive power, it must not be just Hoover's intention alone. People like the important figures of the Commerce Committee and experts from the Tariff Committee must also feel that this kind of high tax is really not suitable for today, so they give the President the power to reduce it as a measure of expediency.</p>

<h3 id="e62">All-India Congress Chairman Nehru Passes Away <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Dark Oppression Remains Unabated</p>
<p>Innocent Civilians Routinely Assaulted</p>
<p>Gandhi Cables True State of British Rule in India</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Lucknow, 6th: Nehru, leader of the National Congress Party in the Indian Legislative Assembly and chairman of the All-India National Congress, passed away here today at the age of sixty-nine. After graduating from university, Nehru practiced law. In 1920, he joined the non-cooperation movement. The following year, he was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 500 rupees for participating in the illegal organization of the National Congress Volunteer Corps. In 1922, he and Das organized the Indian Swaraj Party. The following year, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and became the leader of the Swaraj Party members.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 6th: Nehru was charged on July 1st of last year with being a member of an illegal assembly and sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Subsequently, due to illness, he was secretly released by the authorities on September 8th. Nehru suffered from anemia, gradually became thin, and weakened in strength, unable to bear the heavy responsibility of the chairman of the All-India Congress Committee. He had no choice but to seek rest and go to Calcutta for medical treatment. Upon returning to Allahabad, Gandhi saw that his illness was severe and accompanied him to Lucknow for treatment on February 4th. Only two days after arriving, his condition worsened, and he passed away.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 6th: The Daily Mail published a cable from Gandhi from Allahabad, stating: "I am not yet able to express my final opinion on the Round Table Conference. But if the Round Table Conference truly grants India freedom, there should be a corresponding response here. However, I see that dark acts of oppression remain unabated, innocent civilians are still being assaulted, officials arbitrarily seize the property of respectable people under the guise of administrative actions, and women marching are forcibly dispersed, with police grabbing their hair and beating them, and kicking them with leather boots. Even if other difficulties are removed, the continuation of this kind of oppression will make cooperation between the National Congress and the government impossible."</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Bombay, 6th: Representatives of twenty-six Indian states and the British Indian representatives to the recent Round Table Conference (who arrived here today) have signed a statement declaring that Sapru, Jayakar, and Sastri will visit Gandhi as soon as possible, hoping that the leaders of the All-India Congress will make substantive contributions to completing the current outline plan for the Indian Constitution.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Japanese Parliament Increasingly Tumultuous, Staging Bloody Farce <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Frontal Clash of Outside Groups</p>
<p>Petition Room Transformed into a Slaughterhouse</p>
<p>More Than Ten Injured, Including Parliament Members Nakajima and Kimura</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: This morning's session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee concerning the proper handling of the "slip of the tongue" issue and the subsequent proceedings failed to achieve a compromise between the two factions. The ruling and opposition parties had separately held discussions in different rooms before noon. At 1:30 PM, Committee Chairman Takenouchi took his seat, with Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara and all other cabinet members in attendance. Deep in the hall of the Seiyukai party first shouted loudly at Shidehara "Shidehara are you ashamed". Secretary-General Suzuki tried to stop him, and then the ranks of guards and the angry shouts of the Seiyukai members suddenly turned into a noisy scene. Committee Chairman Takenouchi made a statement to the crowd, but it was ultimately inconclusive. Opposition and party members shouted at each other, and order was greatly disrupted. General Affairs Chief Shimada advised Committee Chairman Takenouchi to take a temporary recess, but Mr. Takenouchi refused. Prime Minister Shidehara, Inoue, Ugaki, and Machida whispered to each other on the ministerial bench, while the other cabinet members appeared listless. At 2:45 PM, Shimada advised the committee chairman to take a temporary recess for the third time. Afterwards, someone whispered to General Affairs Kudo of the Minseito party, and then angry shouts and scolding and roars broke out. Secretary-General Suzuki, Kudo, Ichimatsu, Okamoto, and others met frequently. Ichimatsu secretly told the results of the discussion to the committee chairman and forcibly reorganized the chamber. Mr. Shimada stated loudly that the reason why the committee chairman could not use appropriate methods to promote the proceedings was due to the lack of sincerity of the government and the ruling party. Therefore, if the chaos continues, the responsibility rests entirely with the government and the ruling party.</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM, Army Minister Ugaki left the chamber, followed by Shidehara. Committee Chairman Takenouchi saw that Shidehara had reached the corridor and announced a recess at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>At the same time, members of parliament and outside groups surged in, leading to a major brawl, which resulted in an ominous event of bloodshed. Both parliament members, Nakajima from the Seiyukai and Kimura from the Minseito party, and many others were injured as a result. After the cabinet members had left, someone suddenly broke the glass window of the petition committee room, and crowds gathered in the corridor. At this time, a group broke into the petition room, staging a dramatic brawl. Thus, the petition room became a major slaughterhouse. Initially, inkpots, spittoons, and wine bottles from the committee room were used as weapons. Later, some secretly used short knives to stab wildly. Some fled with heads covered in blood, and some chased after others with short knives in hand, falling into unprecedented chaos. At this time, members of parliament Kimura and Nakajima and more than ten members of both the ruling and opposing groups were injured on the head, face, hands and feet, etc. and were given first aid in the medical office inside the parliament. On the one hand, the police affairs section captured the perpetrators for interrogation. Speaker Fujisawa, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives Taguchi, Chief Guard Nishimura and others led their subordinates to the scene to inspect the incident, and discussed measures for dealing with the violent incident in the Speaker's office. During the recess of the budget committee, a sudden bloody incident occurred. Afterwards, members of both sides discussed methods to deal with the incident. Committee Chairman Takenouchi planned to seek a strategy to break the deadlock, and asked Shimada Toshio of the Seiyukai to meet, but Mr. Shimada refused. The path to compromise was completely lost, and they were forced to adjourn during the recess. It is currently uncertain whether a meeting will be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>Budget Committee Session Adjourns on the 5th</p>
<p>Killing Intent Pervades the Gallery</p>
<p>Political Detectives Infiltrate Parliament</p>
<p>▲ Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Because the disturbance in the morning prevented the proceedings, the House of Representatives budget committee session on the 5th, despite the fact that the opinions of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties were still not unified at 1 PM, Committee Chairman Takenouchi announced the resumption of the meeting. At the same time, due to the convenience of the proceedings, he announced another recess at 3:30 PM. At 3:35 PM, the meeting was convened for the third time. Committee members, observers, and members of parliament from both the ruling and opposition parties entered the chamber one after another. Committee Chairman Takenouchi announced the resumption of the meeting. At the same time, after consultation with the speaker, he recessed again at 6:30 PM. Committee Chairman Takenouchi then opened a small committee to seek a compromise strategy. The opposition's attitude remained strong and no results were obtained. The two factions were locked in a stalemate. However, they finally announced the fourth meeting. In order to prevent the proceedings from proceeding, the opposition neglected the main conference, and therefore fully occupied the gallery before 1 o'clock, with killing intent on their faces, giving the impression that a storm was about to break. At 7:30 PM, all committee members took their seats, but Committee Chairman Takenouchi was not seen. The opposition shouted, "Where is the Committee Chairman?" "Has the budget committee been suspended?" At this time, Committee Chairman Takenouchi, who was holding a board meeting in another room, took the committee chairman's seat at 8 PM and announced the resumption of the meeting. The chamber was suddenly chaotic, and after a few minutes, he announced another recess. At this point, the ruling party was at a loss. At 9:35 PM, the meeting was convened for the fifth time. Seiyukai members shouted and roared, but the ruling party was still at a loss. At 9:49 PM, the meeting adjourned, and it was decided to continue the meeting on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>▲ Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 6th: There was another reason why the budget committee session on the 5th was convened five times and ultimately adjourned. That is, Yoshikawa Shigeru and two other detectives from the High Class Section of the Metropolitan Police Department, and Sergeant Yokoo from the Tokyo Military Police Corps, all infiltrated the chamber in plain clothes and were discovered by Seiyukai members. At the time, the Seiyukai side took their business cards, chanted loudly, and shouted "Adachi's detective politics" incessantly. Afterwards, the Seiyukai immediately held an emergency cadre meeting in the rest room, and as a result of the discussion of the issue, it was decided that since Interior Minister Adachi had sent detectives to infiltrate the parliament, the responsibility should be thoroughly pursued.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Hopes for Compromise on the "Slip of the Tongue" Issue Dashed <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Ruling and Opposition Parties Take Adversarial Stance</p>
<p>Seiyukai Resolves to Censure</p>
<p>▲ Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 6th: General Affairs Directors Morita and Yamamichi of the Minseito party visited Interior Minister Adachi at his official residence at 10 o'clock this morning to inquire whether Mr. Mochizuki's reply to the Seiyukai had arrived. Interior Minister Adachi replied that the reply had arrived, "According to one Seiyukai cadre meeting, Prime Minister Shidehara's 'slip of the tongue' cannot be simply dismissed with a clarification." The Minseito Party immediately convened a meeting of parliament members and a cadre meeting to consult with the two bodies, and decided that the party could not concede another step on this issue. They should proceed with their consistent attitude, that is, to face the parliament with this attitude.</p>
<p>▲ Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Seiyukai has decided to strongly censure Prime Minister Shidehara on the "slip of the tongue" issue, based on upholding the spirit of constitutional government and moving forward. As a result, the conflict has intensified, and there is no prospect of a resolution. There are two reasons why the Seiyukai is taking a strong stance. First, Prime Minister Shidehara's words, such as the reply document issue and insulting political parties, and this "slip of the tongue" issue, are fundamentally incompatible with the Seiyukai's view of constitutional politics. Therefore, they hold high the banner of upholding the constitution and want to argue right and wrong. Second, within the Minseito party, there have been opponents of Prime Minister Shidehara from the beginning. With the ruling party ending, loopholes have emerged, so they want to attack its weaknesses and see this as a perfect opportunity and have a strong determination.</p>
<h3 id="e65">German Chancellor Brüning Announces New Budget Proposal <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Urges Parliament to Pass Quickly</p>
<p>Wins Sympathy of French Press</p>
<p>▲ Guomin, Berlin, 5th: Parliament convened today to debate the government's budget proposal. The entire chamber and the gallery were packed. When Chancellor Brüning took the podium, cheers thundered. Mr. Brüning's speech stated that the government is willing to govern the country jointly with parliament, rather than against it. The government has no intention of implementing a dictatorial system. If any political party attempts to do so, the government will strictly prevent it. The government hopes that parliament will pass the budget proposal quickly and will never use the privileges granted by Article 48 of the Constitution to publicize the budget proposal, which proves the government's aversion to a dictatorial system. The whole world is now paying attention to the debate on the German budget proposal and the situation of its passage. If parliament is aware of its responsibilities, it should pass it before the end of March, because the repayment of foreign debts, the relief of agriculture, and the placement of the unemployed all depend on it. He went on to say that the government based its budget on its income and expenditures and strives for frugality. If tax revenues are lower than budgeted, the government will never collect new taxes, but will reduce expenditures to make up for the shortfall. He then spoke about the reparations issue, saying that the government is currently preparing a grand policy for the issue, so that the purpose of reconsidering the reparations issue can be achieved. Finally, he welcomed the resolution of the majority to propose reforming the parliamentary system, saying that this proves that the majority of all political parties, like the government, are determined to remedy past mistakes to avoid repeating them, and that Germany's financial balance must be restored in the future, which is the foundation for the success of domestic and foreign policies.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin, Paris, 6th: The Paris newspapers expressed sympathy for the budget proposal announced by German Chancellor Brüning in Parliament. Even the Parisian "People's Daily" praised this measure by Brüning, saying that this is the most prideful act he has taken since taking office.</p>

<p>Famous Anti-Fascist Shiro Arrested</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Rome, 5th: Rumors had been circulating for days that police had uncovered a plot to assassinate Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Authorities have now confirmed part of it. Shiro, a well-known anti-Fascist and anarchist, had gone to the United States last year and recently returned to plot the assassination of Mussolini and other dignitaries. Days ago, he was seen loitering near the Palazzo Quirinale, arousing police suspicion. When police tried to arrest him, Shiro opened fire, wounding three police officers, one of whom is in critical condition. Shiro then attempted to kill himself but was only wounded. He was taken to the hospital for surgery and is expected to be able to stand trial within a few weeks. It is said that police had received warnings and had taken strict precautions. Mussolini, for the sake of caution, did not go to the Palazzo Quirinale but resided in the Villa Torlonia.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 5th: During today's Opium Committee discussion on the Far East drug trade, the Chinese representative strongly emphasized China's current great efforts to crack down on illegal opium trade, saying that China has repeatedly promulgated new regulations banning the opium trade in the past two years, the effectiveness of which is quite encouraging. The Chinese Foreign Minister has stated that the import and sale of narcotics will be handled by the national agency organized by the Ministry of Interior, and the amount of narcotics imported annually can be determined by the State Council. In addition, pharmacies selling drugs and ports of entry must be designated, and Shanghai will be the limit. All countries with concessions in China should cooperate to carry out this drug prevention work. The Opium Committee decided to consider the matter further after the results of the negotiations to investigate the current situation in China in accordance with the 1929 Opium Committee proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Stalin Optimistic About Industrial Plan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guomin, Moscow, 5th: Stalin declared at the so-called Soviet Russian Industrial Red Council that the five-year industrial plan is progressing step by step and is expected to succeed. The future of Soviet Russian funding is very optimistic. The program to increase production by 45% this year is currently being implemented. Some say that the development of industry should not be rushed, but should be done step by step. This statement cannot be accommodated, because it is equivalent to self-indulgence. We must know that at the beginning of the Soviet Russian revolution, its industrial situation was already a hundred years behind the developed industrial countries of Europe and the West. Now it must catch up quickly in the next ten years, so that it can be on par with them. The audience cheered.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Napier Earthquake Losses <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Prosperous Areas Almost Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Hastings Continues to Experience Aftershocks</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Wellington, 5th: The town of Hastings, twelve miles from Napier, was the hardest hit by the earthquake. There was another aftershock at 10 PM last night. The situation is serious, and martial law has been implemented. A train will travel south tomorrow morning to take the most seriously injured out for medical treatment. The authorities, fearing that too many people would compete for the train, have sent troops to guard it. A second train will load disaster victims in the afternoon to leave the area. Communication between here and Napier has been cut off for several days. Trains may be able to travel to Napier on Saturday and Sunday. The British corvette "Veronica," of 1,200 tons and a draft of 12 feet, is currently grounded and cannot sail because, even during high tide, the depth is only six feet. The seabed off Napier has risen quite a bit, with some reefs as high as eighteen feet.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Wellington, 6th: News from Napier this morning is more optimistic. The loss of life in the earthquake is not as great as thousands of people. According to current estimates, no more than one hundred people have died in Napier. Material losses are estimated at about £2.5 million. The search for bodies is still ongoing. Efforts are underway to transport women and children out of the area, as the sewers are damaged and there are fears of disease.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Wellington, 6th: Officials are counting the number of victims in Hastings, which is estimated to be between 120 and 130 people. The death toll in Napier will be much higher. Fifty-nine bodies have already been buried, including ten whose faces were unrecognizable and whose names could not be identified. The work of examining corpses has now been suspended. After the walls that are about to collapse are pulled down, the search will resume. This difficult and dangerous work is being undertaken by naval soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Jin Sui Generals' Recent Meeting <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲ Three Measures Decided</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The issue of military streamlining in Jin Province has gradually become smooth after recent mediation by various parties. However, small group meetings of various factions are still held from time to time. Xu, Yang, and others originally scheduled a formal meeting at the headquarters the day before yesterday (30th), but it was adjourned after only a few people discussed it for a long time because the military commanders were not all present. Yesterday afternoon, at about 3 p.m., a final formal agreement was made in the Senate Hall of the headquarters. The following is a description of the process: Before the meeting of the Jin Sui generals in the Senate Hall, Zeng Zhi, Gao Buqing, Zhang Hanjie, and Fu Cunhuai explained everything to the military commanders. The military commanders then had a detailed discussion and exchanged opinions at Zhang Huizhao's private residence at No. 26, Zhengjie Street, Xinmin, at 12:00 noon. At 3:00 p.m., Yang Aiyuan, Feng Pengzhu, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Yang Yaofang, Yang Xiaou, Zhang Huizhao, Sun Chu, Yang Chengyuan, Li Shengda, and the cavalry commander Zhao Chengzhou, the military police commander Li Runfa, the artillery commander Zhou Dai, and the mediators Zhang Hanjie, Gao Buqing, Fu Cunhuai, and Chen Zengzhi all arrived. At 3:30, Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen continued to attend the meeting, and the meeting was declared open. First, the mediator explained the opinions of the generals and the mediator's proposals, and then the discussion began. Xu Yongchang, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Feng Pengzhu and others spoke one after another. At 4:30, the four mediators, Chen Zengzhi and others, withdrew, and the generals continued to discuss. The newly appointed military commanders Shang, Xu, and Yang all expressed their willingness to give up their positions as military commanders. In other words, the military commander system will not be established. The results are as follows: (1) The organization will still be eight divisions, and the division commanders will be Wang Jingguo, Feng Pengzhu, Yang Yaofang, Yang Xiaou, Li Shengda, Yang Chengyuan, and Fu Zuoyi. As for Sun Chu's army, it will be reorganized into a railway protection army. The vacant position of division commander will be filled by Li Fuying or Zhang Huizhao. (2) Three garrison commands will be established in southern Jin, northern Jin, and Taiyuan, and will be filled by Rong Honglu, Zhang Huizhao, and Li Fuying. Each garrison command will be in charge of two regiments of the army. (3) The original main commanders of the military commanders retained 60 regiments. Now Zhang of Liaoning has agreed to establish 50 large regiments. According to these 50 large regiments, the number is even greater than that of 60 regiments, so this problem can also be solved. (4) The Military Commission discussed for an hour. Because the opinions of the generals on the candidates were not consistent, no decision was made. Finally, it was agreed to send representatives to Liaoning to ask Vice Commander Zhang for instructions on everything within days. The meeting adjourned at 7:50 p.m. (February 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Jin People's Two Major Demands Recently <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲Consolidating Provincial Currency ▲Taking over and Reforming the Arsenal</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Since Yan's retirement and the great changes in Jin Province, the people of Jin have originally had three major demands for the aftermath of the Jin situation. The first is the issue of the provincial chairman, which is related to the safety of the entire province. It is advocated that Jin people govern Jin. The second is the issue of the provincial currency, which is related to the people's livelihood in the entire province. It is advocated to earnestly request the central government to restore the originally planned public debt of 24 million yuan to consolidate Shanxi's finances, or to find ways to cash it out quickly in the province. The third is the arsenal that sucks the people's blood and sweat. It is advocated to return it to the people and transform it into a production agency. When Yan first left, the selection of the provincial chairman was the most intense. Some advocated Kong Xiangxi, some advocated Wen Shouquan, and some advocated Sun Chu. Discussions were held either outside the province or within the province. The discussions were mixed and endless. After the Tianjin Agreement was reached and the central government issued the order to appoint Shang Zhen, although the voice of military and civilian separation was still being chanted loudly, there was not much mention of the slogan of Jin people governing Jin. Today, what the people of Jin Province urgently need is to consolidate the provincial currency and reorganize the arsenal. These two are interrelated, and the people feel the pain most deeply. This demand has recently been specifically put forward by the two major people's organizations, the Provincial Party Department and the Post-Disaster Reconstruction Promotion Association, and listed as the two major central movements of the people. Regarding the issue of consolidating the provincial currency, in addition to unanimously requesting the central government to issue financial public bonds, the Party Department has recently been actively carrying out the process of requesting the provincial government to implement the liquidation of Yan's assets to offset the 6 million yuan in cash that Yan had withdrawn from the provincial government before his departure. The provincial government is responsible for recovering it. However, whether it can be done in practice is doubtful. After all, the number of Yan's movable properties is unknown to those who are not insiders. Before Yan left, the soft furnishings used in the headquarters' private residence were all transported back to his original hometown by car. Since the person has left, how could he be willing to leave his savings in Jin? Moreover, it is certain that Yan has deposited money in foreign banks for several years, so it is naturally not easy to liquidate the movable properties. As for his immovable properties, there are very few. It is said that the value of Yan's ancestral land and houses is less than 10,000 yuan. As for those in Bingyuan, there are only two residences in Donghuayuan and Xihuayuan, one residence in Tongshun Lane, the old Jin Sheng Bank and Jin Yu Grain Store, the Daoshengheng Pharmacy and other shop addresses, and a small number of shares in various commercial firms. Even if all of them are searched, I am afraid it will not be more than 300,000 yuan. I don't know how the provincial government will start. In order to respond to the demands of the people, the provincial government has decided to implement a monthly lottery of 500,000 yuan in cash in the near future. However, this is just a kind of decoration in the depreciation of banknotes. No one has mentioned the fundamental solution. As for the issue of transforming the arsenal into a livelihood agency, it is most justified in terms of reason and logic. However, the nature of an arsenal is different from that of an ordinary factory, and whether the environment will allow it is still a problem. In addition to expanding publicity and carrying out various activities, the Party Department and various associations have specifically telegraphed the central government yesterday to formally request it. The text is as follows: To the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing: We have submitted proposals regarding the aftermath of Shanxi. We should briefly state the method of handling the Shanxi arsenal. We have not yet received a reply. I am very anxious. I believe that this factory is deeply and greatly related to the safety of the party and the country and the happiness and misfortune of the people of Jin. I dare to express my humble opinion and list the outlines. The manufacture of munitions in this factory is nothing less than a talisman for warlords and a fuse for civil wars. It is actually a tool for slaughtering the people. Last year, Yan rebelled and dared to betray the central government. The weapons he relied on were the most important part of this factory. The people of Jin are determined to learn from the past and prevent future troubles. They all believe that this factory should not exist. If we do not take this opportunity to resolutely eliminate it, one day it will fall into the hands of ambitious people and be controlled by one person or one faction. I am afraid that it will have the resources to create chaos and that supervision will be difficult. If the situation is stirred up, it will be enough to use it to poison the people and bring disaster to the local area. This is the first reason why this factory should be resolved as soon as possible. This factory was originally formed by Yan sucking the essence of the people of Jin and squeezing the people's fat. It has been operating for more than ten years and has cost tens of millions of dollars. Now, in order to prevent turmoil and develop industry, we should use the original foundation of this factory to establish a large-scale production agency, so that the blood capital that the people of Jin have paid for more than ten years will still be returned to the public of all the people of Jin for the purpose of producing food and clothing. All the workers in the factory can also maintain their livelihoods, so that they will not be displaced and become bandits. In a single transition, all the benefits will be available. This is the second reason why this factory should be resolved as soon as possible. If the central government believes that it is necessary to continue to maintain the factory for national defense, it should also prevent problems before they occur and not repeat the mistakes of the past. It should quickly send personnel to inspect and accept it, estimate a reasonable price, and compensate all the people of Jin, so as to relieve the financial crisis and handle all the aftermath matters. At the same time, the factory should be taken over by the central government for direct jurisdiction, so as to avoid the powerful seizing the opportunity to occupy it, causing the local people to suffer from war again. This is the third reason why this factory should be resolved as soon as possible. The above-mentioned reasons and methods are considered by our association to be of the utmost importance to the lives and property of all the people of Jin. We should telegraph this to your association for review and approval, and then request the National Government to adopt and implement it. We are looking forward to your order. Shanxi Provincial Executive Committee of the Kuomintang (February 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Joint Suppression of Bandits Between Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The border area between Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces has become a zone where bandits run rampant due to the impact of years of war. Therefore, bandits are everywhere in Su County, Xiao County, Yongcheng, and Xiayi counties, and looting occurs almost every day. Moreover, the mountains and ridges are mixed, making it particularly difficult to suppress them. Moreover, defeated soldiers and vagrants are mixed with them, and the residents suffer unspeakable devastation. In November last year, the Lin Huan and Bai Shan areas in the northwest of Su County were disturbed by the defeated soldiers of Sun Dianying's army. They were dispersed by the troops and militias of Su and Yong counties. However, the accumulated bandits in the northwest have been entrenched for a long time and have not been eliminated. Recently, more than 2,000 defeated soldiers, led by Yang Xiyue, have come to Nanpiqiaoji (territory of Yongcheng), which is more than 70 miles northwest of Suixi County. They are armed with artillery, machine guns, and mortars, and occupy more than 40 villages, killing, looting, and plundering, no different from bandits. The Yongcheng garrison reported the news and sent a regiment to suppress them. Because of the weak force, more than 100 soldiers were injured by the defeated soldiers. Now they are increasing the deployment of troops to block the south of the county. As for Xiayi in eastern Henan, more than 100 defeated soldiers have recently joined forces with Wang Liuni, a bandit in Xiao County, with more than 200 men, and窜 to Zhuxiaozhuang, which is at the junction of Su, Yong, and Xiao counties, and a part of them have occupied Zhangji in the Suixi area. The area immediately mobilized the People's Self-Defense Corps to block them. In addition, the bandit atmosphere in the area of Xiangli in the northern part of Su County has also been fierce recently. Hualou, which is about two miles north of Caili, has been occupied by bandits. The remaining 200 bandits who overturned officials have also joined the Hualou bandits and are preparing to confront the government army. The Suixi People's Self-Defense Corps and the First Battalion of the Su County Police Reserve Regiment recently stationed in Tuxingwei, and notified the Second Battalion of the Police Reserve Regiment stationed in Nanjieting and the Xiao County Police Regiment stationed in Xiaoshicun to jointly attack the bandits in Hualou, and searched for the accumulated bandits in Shantao Songzhuang area. They are currently under siege. (January 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Bandit Forces in Southern Anhui Are Rampant Again <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Found Near Wuhu</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Sanxingwei, which belongs to Dangtu County in southern Anhui and is 40 miles away from Wuhu, is connected to Wuhu. Suddenly, a group of bandits was found there a few days ago, with a total of more than 100 people, with about 80 rifles. They were very rampant. The families of Gu Daoxin and others, farmers in Anliuzha in Wuhu County, were blackmailed and robbed. They also attacked the Seventh District Militia there. The head of the militia, Wu Dingan, led the militia to fight hard, but was shot by bandits and died on the spot. A team from the Wuhu Xingchunwei Militia also assisted, and a militiaman was also killed. The Seventh District Militia lost several guns. Many bandits were also killed. After receiving the report, Yu Yuying, the county magistrate of Wuhu County, in addition to sending Ding Shikai, the captain of the special task force, to lead the team, and ordering the dispatch of various squadrons to rush to encircle and suppress them, also went to the headquarters of the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu overnight to request Wang Leshan, the brigade commander, to send troops to assist. Brigade Commander Wang had already ordered the dispatch of two companies of the Second Battalion of the 341st Regiment, led by Battalion Commander Wang, to rush to the scene at dawn this morning to surround the bandits. The bandits are still gathering to resist stubbornly, and are still in stalemate. In addition, although the bandits in Langxi Guangde have been suppressed by the army many times, it is not easy to eliminate them due to the mountains and ridges in Xiaofeng and other places. A few days ago, about 200 bandits with about 120 guns窜 out of the Yasha Mountain area and looted the town of Feilqiao, which is 20 miles away from Langxi. When the garrison heard the alarm and rushed there, the bandits hid in the mountains again. The local people are now planning to recruit and appease them, but it is not known what the result will be.

<h3 id="e80">Financial Difficulties in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲New Measures for Addressing Both Immediate and Underlying Problems Formulated by the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi's bandit-stricken areas are vast. Of the province's 81 counties, only a dozen or so can remit funds. Revenue is less than 20-30% of the budget. When Chen Jiadong was the director of the Department of Finance, he already felt that all resources were exhausted. After Huang Bozhong took over, the monthly budget of 1.2 million local revenue was only 70,000-80,000 yuan. Therefore, in addition to borrowing shop rents for three months in the provincial capital, borrowing funds from merchants with beneficial circulating coupons, and issuing tens of thousands of yuan of short-term treasury bonds to be used as rice rations for the bandit suppression troops, administrative expenses were in arrears for three to four months, education expenses were in arrears for five to six months, treasury bonds fell to 20-30% of their face value, and circulating coupons were only worth 70-80% of their face value. After the elimination of the likin, the annual shortage was 1.7-1.8 million yuan. The future of finance is unimaginable. However, the province is once again full of troops, and military spending is particularly urgent. Therefore, the provincial government is paying close attention to this. In addition to requesting the central government to bear all the expenses for bandit suppression, it has also formulated measures to address the immediate problems: (1) The Department of Finance will send personnel to various counties near the provincial capital that have not been affected by bandits to urge the collection of grain tribute; (2) Director Huang of the Department of Finance will persuade the business community in the province to sell 200,000 yuan of treasury bonds to solve the urgent problem. The underlying problems were also addressed: 1. Request the central government to return the 3 million yuan advanced by the provincial treasury; 2. Telegraph Beijing to request that after the salt surcharge tax is turned over to the central government, the education, treasury bond, and circulating coupon funds will still be borne by the salt tax and salt surcharge tax, or that public bonds will be allocated to repay them; 3. All livestock tax will be returned to the Ministry of Finance for its own management. All subsidies for the two eliminations of the likin will be paid by the Ministry of Finance from the salt tax; 4. Various post-war reconstruction expenses in the province will be allowed to be offset by the land tax, and post-war reconstruction bonds will be issued (the amount is undetermined); 5. The budget for the 19th year will absolutely adhere to the policy of austerity; 6. Business tax will be implemented. The Department of Finance will formulate detailed rules in accordance with the business tax regulations promulgated by the central government to facilitate implementation. In addition, the municipal finance bureau is also preparing to conduct business registration to facilitate tax collection and increase revenue. (January 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Guangdong Province Imposes Three Unified Taxes <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>▲New Regulations on Tax Rates for Cotton Yarn, Matches, and Cement</p>
<p>▲Cigarette Tax Also Imposed on February 1st</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the elimination of the likin in Guangdong, various special taxes have been imposed to offset the loss of the likin tax. The unified taxes on cotton yarn, matches, and cement have been levied since February 1st. The Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Unified Tax Bureau has formulated tax rates for these three items respectively. After that day, all domestically produced and imported cotton yarn, matches, and cement must be reported and inspected at the local management office, inspection office, branch office, or factory representative before they can be sold. The tax rates for these three unified taxes are as follows: (1) Cotton yarn: 2.75 yuan per 100 catties for those within 23 strands, 3.75 yuan for those exceeding that, and 5% of the price for others; (2) Matches: 5 yuan per large box for those less than 43 mm in length or less than 75 sticks per box, 7.5 yuan for those 52 mm in length or less than 100 sticks, and 10 yuan for those exceeding that. Each large box contains 7,200 boxes; (3) Cement: 6 jiao per barrel weighing 380 pounds. If it exceeds or falls short of this, the tax will be levied proportionally. In addition to import duties, imported goods will still be subject to the unified tax. Domestically produced goods are exempt from export tax. In addition, taxes on cigarettes, cigars, etc. will also be increased at the same time. The tax rates have been set by the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Unified Tax Bureau and will be implemented on the 1st according to the new unified tax rates. The tax rates are as follows: A.

<p>The Security Team Seized a Female Bandit. Cao Pang, the commander of the Second Regiment of the Security Team, previously sent Bai Jizhi's department of the First Battalion to Jinshanwei, which is located at the junction of Songjiang and Jinshan, to maintain security. Battalion Commander Bai, because bandits frequently appear in the surrounding four townships, sends teams out on patrol every day to find traces of bandits. On the 4th of this month, Battalion Commander Bai personally led the first and second companies on patrol to the vicinity of Liujia Yanqiao. In front of a certain surname's house, he saw a saddled horse. He led the police officers with a guide to go there. The bandits had already received the news and escaped by swimming across the river from the back. The military police rushed to the house, but there was no way to track them down. Inside, they saw three female bandits who were also trying to escape. They were immediately arrested and two guns and more than 100 rounds of ammunition were found, as well as a saddled horse. They were transferred to the regimental headquarters in Songjiang yesterday. According to the interrogation of the three female bandits, whose names are Shen Jinshi, Gu A'bao, and Li Chenshi, they firmly denied being bandits. However, Gu A'bao confessed that her brother was Gu A'long, one of the most notorious bandits, which is undeniable. They are temporarily detained in the county government pending further interrogation. It is rumored that the bandit's den was hosting a banquet on that day, with notorious bandits such as Zhu Luo A'mei inside. The horse was his mount. Because the guide mistakenly led the way, the bandit's den had already received the news and removed the wooden bridge in advance, so they were able to escape calmly. It is also said that Gu A'bao and Shen Jinbao are concubines of Taibao A'shu, and Li Chenshi is his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>A Shopping Mall Was Built on the Shadow Wall of Xuanmiao Temple. The construction company built a shopping mall at the site of the Shadow Wall of Xuanmiao Temple. The National Goods Relief Association had submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. The site is a scenic spot with historical sites, and people from China and foreign countries are concerned about it. If stores are opened, they are limited to selling national goods and are not allowed to sell foreign goods. The county government was ordered to comply. The county government has now approved the request of Abbot Yan Juecang and merchants such as Xiang Xunru and others after they submitted a detailed report and signed a land lease contract, started building houses, and have no stores specializing in foreign goods, which also implies the intention to promote national goods. The county government has approved the request. At the shareholder meeting held by the National Goods Relief Association on the 6th, some people, including Bu Gengxin, proposed that since someone had submitted a request to the county government for approval, the tone of the request was that there were no stores specializing in foreign goods, which also implied the intention to promote national goods. It was obvious that the intention was to also sell foreign goods, which violated the orders of the Executive Yuan. The meeting resolved to submit a request to the county government to strictly enforce the orders of the Executive Yuan, and to issue a notice ordering the stores in the area to absolutely not sell foreign goods in order to comply with the orders of the Executive Yuan and maintain national goods.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce Convened a General Meeting of All Industries: The County Chamber of Commerce recently received repeated complaints from various industries stating that the newly drafted "Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax in Jiangsu Province" and its detailed implementation rules exceeded the Ministry's outline by nearly ten times. Furthermore, the daily inspections of stamp tax were causing disturbances everywhere. They requested a meeting to discuss countermeasures. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 5th, a general meeting of representatives from various industries was convened, attended by 74 people from 43 industries. Chen Zhanru presided over the meeting, and the following resolutions were made: (A) Regarding the business tax issue, the chairman first reported that the recently promulgated Outline for the Collection of Business Tax by the Ministry and the nine articles of the outline decided at the 17th Reorganization Conference differed significantly in content. The chamber had already telegraphed the Ministry requesting an explanation and planned to jointly discuss countermeasures with the chambers of commerce of various counties in the shortest possible time. After discussion, it was decided (1) to appoint Qian Sunqing and Cheng Jing堂 as representatives to attend the joint meeting of chambers of commerce of various counties; (2) each industry should first submit written opinions to the chamber, which would then be handed over to the two representatives, Qian and Cheng, for reference. (B) Regarding the stamp tax issue, the chairman first reported on the recent request from the bureau for an increase in the assessed amount and the situation of inspectors checking outside. Then, the representative of the clothing industry reported that in the second-hand clothing store opened by Cheng Ziquan, the head of the stamp tax bureau's inspection team, the stamps on the account books were completely untaxed. He had obtained three copies of these books and asked if stamp tax bureau officials' account books in their stores were exempt from stamp tax. This immediately aroused strong emotions. As a result, it was decided (1) that the bureau should unconditionally return all checked account books to the shops; (2) to accommodate the bureau's opinion and increase the amount in accordance with the old quota as appropriate; (3) during the accounting period of the business community, the bureau shall not send inspectors to harass them again; (4) the three unstamped account books obtained by the clothing industry from Cheng Ziquan should be sent to the chamber for safekeeping pending further action.</p>

So far, no approval has been received. Recently, the Shanghai Silk Factory Association sent a letter discussing the reduction and exemption of the special tax and its position on business tax. Because this matter was of great importance, a meeting of all members was specially convened yesterday, chaired by Qian Fenghao. After merging and discussing the above cases, it was decided to continue to telegraph the Ministry and Provincial authorities in accordance with the previous resolution, requesting exemption from the special tax on silk cocoons and stating that the business tax was even more unacceptable.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Pullers Strike in Jiaxing: After the Jiaxing Rickshaw Company organized the trade association the day before yesterday, it began printing and distributing rickshaw licenses to members of the rickshaw puller trade union on the 5th. The license stated that each vehicle must pay a monthly rental of 12 yuan, so the rickshaw pullers expressed their opposition and demanded a return to the old system of paying rent on a daily basis. Therefore, at noon on the 5th, the rickshaws inside and outside the city went on strike. As of the morning of the 6th, the situation had not been resolved and the rickshaws on the streets were still gone.</p>
<p>County Executive Committee Members Have Been Appointed: The Provincial Executive Committee has appointed Zhou Mingsheng, Zhu Zhenfan, and Cao Xianzhang, who were nominated by the Sixth Jiaxing County Congress, as members of the County Executive Committee, and designated Zhou Mingsheng to convene the first meeting.</p>

<p>Suggestions for Revitalizing Zhejiang Tea: Zhejiang tea's transportation and sales to various countries once held an important position. In recent years, the tea industry has fallen behind, even declining to only a few thousand pounds. If measures are not taken quickly to remedy the situation, the consequences will be unimaginable. The giant merchant Sun Haoji has proposed two ways to revitalize Zhejiang tea and remedy the situation, and has suggested them to the Provincial Government: (1) Internally implement reductions in local tariffs, miscellaneous taxes, and business tax rates, and completely exempt export tea taxes, so as to reduce costs and gain a foothold in overseas competition. (2) Establish a tea industry school to cultivate talent, send them abroad to tea-producing areas to conduct detailed inspections, and adopt their strengths to seek various improvements. The Hangjiang Loan Will Be Delivered Soon: For the Hangjiang Railway loan of 3.5 million yuan, the Construction Department has allocated 1.5 million yuan from the construction bonds and the power plant surplus of 500,000 yuan. There is still a shortage of 2 million, which the Shanghai banking community is trying to raise. The Construction Department received a telegram from Shanghai yesterday stating that the loan of 2 million yuan will be paid immediately. There are slight changes in the content of the contract. We will send someone to your department in the next few days to discuss the implementation and sign the agreement.</p>

<p>The Provincial Order Temporarily Suspends the Public Security Bureau's Takeover: The Ningbo Municipal Government was ordered to be abolished and the Yin County Government implemented the takeover on the morning of the 2nd. However, there are still problems with the takeover of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Yin County Magistrate Chen Shilin received a telegram from the Provincial Government stating that the port has special circumstances and the police agency is drafting other measures. The original Public Security Bureau will not be taken over for the time being. The Provincial Government also telegraphed Mao Bingli, the director of the Public Security Bureau, stating that the Municipal Public Security Bureau agency is drafting other measures and ordered him to continue in his post and work hard.</p>
<p>Compilation of Kidnapping and Robbery Cases: (1) Six or seven bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Ma Fucheng in Shi Gongshan Village, Yuyao, and robbed it extensively, and kidnapped Ma's 14-year-old son, Ma Zhulian. (2) Nine bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Xu Xiangmu in Liujiapu, Zi Qi Ao, at the intersection of Yuyao and Cixi, the day before yesterday evening, searched extensively, and kidnapped Xu's four-year-old son, demanding 6,000 yuan. (3) Wang Yaochu, a resident of Zhujia Bridge, Yuyao, is over 60 years old and his family is well-off. Six bandits suddenly arrived at his home the other night.

<p>The Organization of the Qingdao Municipal Hospital: Since Mayor Hu Ruoyu took over the Qingdao Municipal Government, he has actively reorganized the municipal administration. He noted that the city only has two hospitals, Puj济 Hospital and the Infectious Disease Hospital, as well as the Licun Branch, which belongs to Puj济, and the Inspection Institute, which is dedicated to testing sanitation supplies. The organization of all these hospitals and institutes is incomplete. Therefore, he merged and reorganized them into the Qingdao Municipal Hospital. All organizational rules have been submitted and approved by the Municipal Council. On January 31, Tang Jiazhen, a doctor of medicine and the current president of the Qingdao International Sanatorium, was appointed as the president of the Municipal Hospital to reorganize it. It is heard that after accepting the commission, President Tang has drafted a reorganization plan and hired well-known doctors with specialized experience in the country and famous doctors from Japan and Germany to take on various positions.</p>

<p>▲ Came with his wife, Ms. Zhang</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Chen Youren arrived in Shanghai at 5 p.m. yesterday on the Japanese ship Zhushan Maru from France. Mr. Chen has been away from the country for three years. Last year, he married Ms. Zhang Jingjiang at the Chinese Embassy in Paris. The wedding was officiated by Gao Lu, the Chinese Ambassador to France. Mrs. Chen also returned to the country together this time. Mr. Chen is well-known in diplomatic circles. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, he had a dispute with British Counselor O'Malley over the British concession in Hankou, which ended in its recovery, opening a new chapter in China's diplomatic history. When our reporter heard that Chen had returned to the country, he went to inquire, but Chen said it was late and would talk another day.</p>

<p>The reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Finance Minister Song Ziwen yesterday and asked him about some matters. The replies are recorded as follows: (1) The dumping tax that is being planned is the hoarding tax. It is currently being reviewed and handled by the Ministries of Finance and Industry. (2) The business tax in the concessions should also be implemented at the same time. It is currently being carried out by the Shanghai Municipal Government. (3) The Guangdong-Hankou and Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds are being negotiated with the United Kingdom by the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Finance has not been involved. The amount is not small, but I do not remember the exact number.

We will send another telegram to urge them to abolish it. (5) The domestic debt consortium formed by the banks is a necessary organization for the creditors and meets the needs.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Difficulties with Unified Cotton Yarn Tax Resolved Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tax Forms Handled According to the Wheat Flour Unified Tax</p>
<p>▲ Cloth Tax Collection Method Based on Net Yarn</p>
<p>▲ Tax Payments Cleared Monthly</p>
<p>The Riri News Agency reported that representatives from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui who represented the Chinese cotton mills petitioned Director Xie of the Unified Tax Department the afternoon before yesterday, stating their difficulties. It was decided that several responsible representatives would be selected by the representatives to discuss and resolve all difficulties at the Unified Tax Department on the Bund of Hankou Road at 9 a.m. yesterday. At 9 a.m. yesterday morning, Xu Qingyun, Guo Shun, Zhang Zemin, Tang Xinghai, Wang Qiyu, Chen Wanyun, Li Shenhou, Nie Lusheng, and other eight representatives from the Chinese cotton mills arrived at the Unified Tax Department on time. Director Xie Zuokai of the Department was very busy with official duties, so Wang Zong, the director of the Unified Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Dong Zhongding, the secretary of the Unified Tax Department, Wang Junzhi, the chief of the First Section, Liang Jiagan, the chief of the Fifth Section, and Zhou Jiechun, the chief of the Sixth Section, met with the representatives in the reception room. Both sides discussed together, and the results were: (1) Extending the deadline for clearing the existing inventory. Director Shan Xie asked the Minister of Finance for instructions, and there was no problem after the reply. It was not discussed further. (2) Simplify the tax procedures as much as possible. All unified cotton yarn tax forms will be handled in the same way as the unified wheat flour tax. The previously determined forms No. 11, No. 13, No. 16, and No. 17 will not be used temporarily. (3) When cotton yarn leaves the factory, it will be in units of ten small packages or four small packages per piece. The Unified Tax Bureau will issue a separate transportation bill. Cotton yarn of less than ten small packages will not be inspected for the time being after paying the unified tax. (4) For each piece of cotton yarn, the original standard was 315 jin for those below 23 counts, 310 jin for those above 23 counts, and 300 jin for those above 60 counts to 80 counts. Now, it has been changed to 312 jin for those below 23 counts, and 310 jin for all those above 23 counts. (5) For cloth tax collection, because various factories purchase yarn from other factories and mix it in, and because of the paste on the cloth, it has been decided that for yarn spun by the spinning mills themselves and delivered to the weaving factories, the resident tax collectors will register the yarn quantity and collect the tax according to the net yarn. (6) All taxes will be registered in the accounts by the resident tax collectors. On the 25th of each month, the registered amount will be closed once and the tax will be calculated. Before the 30th of each month, each factory will fully pay the tax. Both sides were satisfied with the above items. The representatives left at 12:30.</p>

<p>▲ British Merchants Petition: Yesterday afternoon, representatives from British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill, Public Cotton Mill, and Yangshupu Cotton Mill, consisting of three British and three Chinese representatives, went to the General Taxation Bureau to petition. They were received by Deputy Director Shi, Section Chief Liang, and Technical Expert Zeng, among others. The representatives raised issues regarding procedures. Subsequently, due to several unclear aspects of the General Taxation Regulations, they reviewed the regulations item by item until 6:00 PM. The original points of request were not brought up.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Merchants Petition: Since the implementation of the General Taxation Regulations, Japanese-owned gauze mills in this port had initially been observing the situation. However, due to the requests made by Chinese-owned mills to the bureau in recent days, representatives from Japanese-owned Naigai Cotton Mill, Japanese-owned mills Association in China, and others, totaling six individuals, also petitioned the General Taxation Bureau yesterday at 4:00 PM. They were received by Technical Expert Zeng, representing the bureau. The Japanese merchants stated that they did not oppose the General Taxation Regulations. However, since Chinese merchants had already requested reduced procedures, they requested equal treatment for both Chinese and Japanese parties. Technical Expert Zeng explained each point of the Chinese merchants' requests and stated that there would be equal treatment for both Chinese and foreign parties, without any favoritism. The Japanese representatives expressed their satisfaction and departed.</p>

<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Forms a Special Committee</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Designated to Attend the Bureau of Finance</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of the business tax issue in Shanghai, it is reported that the Bureau of Finance has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the appointment of representatives to participate in discussions. The Chamber of Commerce has formed a committee to conduct research. The following is a record of various news items:</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Chamber of Commerce Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday: Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its first executive committee standing meeting. Over twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Fang Jiaobo, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Fengzhu, Pei Xueqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Ji, Wang Yansong, Cheng Xiechun, Wen Lanting, Ma Jiliang, and Chen Songyuan. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting, and Secretary Yan E’sheng reported on various documents regarding the business tax issue. The chairman also reported on the efforts made to reduce tax rates during discussions in Zhejiang Province. The following items were then discussed: (1) A proposal from the Standing Committee to form a Business Tax Research Committee. It was noted that the business tax issue had been handled according to the resolutions of the tenth executive committee meeting, and instructions and replies had been received. The implementation of the business tax in Shanghai was reportedly underway, and various industries had sent letters to the chamber requesting a reduction in tax rates. The thirtieth standing committee meeting on the second of this month discussed and agreed that it was necessary to form a special committee to conduct detailed research. A proposal with reasons was submitted to the executive committee for discussion and decision. It was resolved to appoint eleven members, including Chen Songyuan, Luo Qinghua, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, Wang Yansong, Lu Qisheng, Ma Jiliang, Shao Baoxing, Cheng Youfu, Zhuang Meitang, and Xiang Songmao, as committee members, with Wang Yansong as the convener. (2) A discussion on a letter from the Municipal Bureau of Finance requesting the designation of one to five representatives. It was resolved to appoint five committee members, including Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, and Chen Songyuan, as representatives.</p>
<p>▲ Suggestions from the Industry Tax Regulations Research Association: The Shanghai Industry Guilds Tax Regulations Research Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, the primary consideration in the collection of business tax is to avoid harming merchants. Therefore, the central government stipulated guidelines for business tax collection, explicitly mandating collection by industry to avoid the trouble of investigations and eliminate the path for extortion. The intention is extremely thorough. However, the draft tax rates proposed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces still use goods as the unit and do not follow the method of dividing by industry. For example, Southern goods dealers sell sugar, ginseng, bird's nest, and ham. The North-South goods industry would be taxed at 5 per mille, sugar and ham at 15 per mille, and ginseng and bird's nest at 20 per mille. The categorization is excessively detailed and confusing. In practice, merchants cannot keep accounts by category. As a result, tax collectors will inevitably use the different tax rates as an excuse to inspect accounts and verify inventory, which will inevitably lead to chaos and endless trouble. The means of extortion will begin from here. Furthermore, the tax is called business tax, so it should be collected on the business, not on the category of goods, which would repeat the mistakes of the previous goods likin tax. As for curbing extravagance, it can be handled separately in the special consumption tax. We have read the Regulations for the Collection of Business Tax passed by the Anhui Provincial Government. Article 4 stipulates that all businesses with an annual business income of 1,000 yuan or more shall pay business tax at a rate of 2 per mille. For the preceding ratio, those with 1,000 yuan shall pay 4 yuan, and the remaining amount shall be increased in units of 500 yuan. This seems simple and easy to implement. We earnestly request that your esteemed association telegraph the Ministry of Finance that, unless the government has other regulations below 2 per mille, the tax rate shall not exceed 2 per mille. The wholesale portion should still be taxed at one-quarter of the rate. The collection method should be based on the proportion of business volume as proposed by Anhui Province, in order to avoid harassment and eliminate malpractices. We eagerly await your response." Addressed to: Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ The Ministry-Issued Outline Matches the Original Plan: Yan E’sheng, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, discussed yesterday's report that the National Business Federation telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that the business tax outline issued in the Ministry of Finance's telegram No. 5492 differed significantly from the one resolved by the National Economy Conference in July of the 17th year of the Republic. It was found that the matter originated on the 3rd of this month when the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for clarification, stating that although the outline issued by the ministry also contained nine articles, why did its content differ from the original plan of the Liquidation Conference? In fact, there were no errors in the outline issued by the ministry. The Wuxi Silk Merchants Association based their understanding on the documents of the initial review meeting of the Liquidation Conference. However, at the general meeting on July 21 of that year, it was handed over to the review committee for a second review. The result was a major revision of the original review. At the general meeting on July 24 of that year, the second review report was slightly revised and formally passed. Its content completely matched what the Zhejiang Finance Department was based on this time. In the section on the nature of cases that should be banned, the sentence "or hindering the development of national goods" was removed. Also, in Article 5, the words "review and deliberation" were changed to "evaluation." There were no other major changes. Therefore, the National Business Federation's telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the outline did not match the original plan, was actually a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Pan Xulun Replies to the Tax Regulations Research Association <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reduce Business Tax Rates</p>
<p>▲ All Chinese People Have Sympathy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industry Guilds Tax Regulations Research Committee sent a letter to accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo, discussing business tax rates. Accountant Xu replied earlier, and the letter was recorded in a previous report. It is now reported that accountant Pan recently went to Beijing to prepare for the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, and only returned to Shanghai yesterday. He immediately replied to the association. The draft of his letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"In reply, I recently received your esteemed letter, and I am grateful for your teachings regarding the business tax collection matter. Several accountants recently went to Beijing to prepare for the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, and only returned yesterday. I apologize for not being able to reply to your letter immediately. I believe that the fact that our country's industries are impoverished and can no longer bear heavy taxes is a universally acknowledged fact. Every time our accounting firm attended meetings on economic, industrial, commercial, financial, and legal regulations, we also made statements to this effect, upholding the purpose of protecting industry and commerce. When we were invited by the Zhejiang Finance Department to participate in the provincial business tax meeting in Hangzhou, we also focused on reducing and equalizing tax rates. I still remember that the draft of the Zhejiang Industry Business Tax Regulations originally stipulated that wholesale merchants should pay half the fixed business tax rate. Several accountants believed that since goods are transferred and sold wholesale many times, half the fixed rate would be too high. They immediately proposed changing it to one-quarter of the fixed rate. Fortunately, the Zhejiang authorities adopted the revised article, and the draft drawn up by Shanghai also uses this point as the basis (the Jiangsu Province draft still uses half the rate and has not been changed). The results of discussions on other tax rate points were also much lower than the originally set numbers. It can be seen that reducing tax rates and promoting industry and commerce is something that all Chinese people have sympathy for, not just your esteemed association. As for the statement in your association's letter that a certain expert compared to foreign tax rates during the Zhejiang meeting, during the sessions attended by our accounting firm, we only heard that a certain gentleman had four calculation standards for business tax collection in foreign countries (i.e., business volume, capital amount, rent amount, and salary amount). We did not hear any expert use foreign tax rates as a comparison. What your association heard may have been a misinterpretation of hearsay. I am writing this letter specifically to reply. I hope you will understand. As for the business tax rate in Shanghai, the municipal authorities have already drafted a plan, but the Financial Discussion Committee has not yet discussed it. If our accounting firm is invited to participate in the discussion, we will contribute our usual opinions to the authorities in the hope that the tax rate will be suitable for the national conditions." Addressed to: Shanghai Industry Guilds Tax Regulations Research Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Foil Industry Guild Requests Reduced Tax Rate <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Foil Industry Guild sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, the Zhejiang Province's business tax rate for foil is set at 15 per mille, which violates the Ministry's regulations. Our guild previously submitted evidence and requested your esteemed association's assistance in forwarding the situation to the Ministry of Finance to request the Zhejiang Provincial Government to return the collected taxes and reduce the tax rate. However, many days have passed, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government has ignored it. Moreover, merchants are being solicited to contract and package goods, and the tax receipts issued are still for business tax, so they cannot be reported to the customs for shipment, hindering sales and causing significant losses. The end of the general settlement period is approaching, and if goods cannot circulate, how can funds be turned over? The industry is running around in panic. The purpose of liquidation was to relieve the pain of merchants and civilians, but what our industry has encountered is the opposite. If this continues, how can the future of the industry be imagined? Therefore, we are submitting this letter to state the situation. We respectfully request that your esteemed association telegraph the Ministry of Finance to immediately abolish the Zhejiang Province's illegal foil business tax bureau, return the collected taxes, and change to a one-item-one-tax system that is implemented nationwide. The new tax rate should not exceed the old tax amount, in order to comply with the resolutions of the Five Provinces Liquidation Conference and fulfill the credibility of the central government, and to reduce the burden and relieve the plight of Jiangsu merchants. We await your urgent instructions." Addressed to: Chairman and Committee Members of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Yongnian.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Guild has been receiving telegrams from industry peers in Beijing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and other places, stating that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments recently set business tax rates, taxing the industry's products at 20 per mille, nearly ten times the outline issued by the ministry. The industry's profits are all from handicrafts and labor, and cannot bear this heavy tax. Jiangsu and Zhejiang are closely related, and should jointly present the situation to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang authorities to strive for a reduction, ensuring that it does not exceed the Ministry's fixed standard of 2 per mille. To plan for unified action, representatives were sent to Shanghai in recent days to convene a meeting to legally organize the Joint Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai Incense and Candle Industry Guilds. Fifteen people, including He Yinsheng, Li Meisheng, Zhu Yongyuan, Zheng Fangbiao, Sun Yaoxun, Zhang Yuzhen, Xu Ruiqing, Wu Yuebo, Qian Xingqiao, Shen Zhongxin, Gu Xiaoshan, Sun Xiangbei, Xu Zijing, Yang Xuexiang, and Shen Genpei, were designated as preparatory committee members, and a preparatory office was established at No. 1 Sanyi Lane, Ninghe Road, Nanshi, to begin work immediately. The telegram submitted for record is recorded below: "To the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Nanjing Municipal Government, Jiangsu Provincial Government, Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Shanghai Municipal Government of the National Government of Nanjing: In accordance with Article 14 of the revised Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, two or more industrial and commercial guilds may form a joint association with the consent of more than one-third of their members. If the joined industrial and commercial guilds belong to the same province, the constitution of the joint association shall be approved by the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for record. If they do not belong to the same province, or cross provinces, or are directly subordinate to the Executive Yuan, they shall be approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, etc. Now, after deliberation by representatives of the incense and candle industry guilds of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai, the Joint Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai Incense and Candle Industry Guilds has been legally organized. Fifteen people, including He Yinsheng, Li Maosheng, Zhu Yongyuan, Zheng Fangbiao, Sun Yaoxun, Zhang Yuzhen, Xu Ruiqing, Wu Yuebo, Qian Xingqiao, Chen Zhongxin, Gu Xiaoshan, Sun Xianglin, Xu Zijing, Yang Yunxiang, and Shen Genpei, have been provisionally designated as preparatory committee members. The preparatory office is temporarily located at No. 3 Sanyi Lane, Ninghe Road, Nanshi, Shanghai, inside the Shanghai Candle Industry Guild, and will begin work immediately. We will submit the drafted constitution separately for review. In addition to this, we should first telegraph your ministry and government for approval and ask for your permission to put it on record. It will be for the public benefit.

<h3 id="e110">Anti-Opium Association Publishes Sun Yat-sen's Anti-Smoking Stance <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Premier's Teachings as a Compass for the Authorities</p>
<p>Recently, there have been divergent views on anti-smoking measures. Some advocate for public sale, others advocate for disguised public sale, and others advocate for absolute prohibition. The rumors are confusing and there is no consensus. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Association, in order to awaken the attention of compatriots and party and government authorities, and to correct the rumors advocating for public sale, has published the full text of Sun Yat-sen's anti-smoking stance, which he published in Guangzhou in 1924 when he was serving as Grand Marshal, as a standard for those advocating for the prohibition of smoking. At a time of such divergent opinions, the Premier's teachings can truly serve as a compass for the authorities implementing anti-smoking measures. The full text is reproduced below:</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the problem of smoking prohibition in China is related to the problem of good government. The business of opium is absolutely incompatible with a democratic government endowed with power by the people. However, until the government authorities have realized the authority of democracy in the implementation of public administration, effective prohibition is hardly possible. At present, the lawless warlords are not only encouraging but also forcing the planting of opium within their jurisdictions. Elaborate and detailed plans for smoking prohibition are of little use. This is because planting opium is simpler and more profitable than planting rice, grains, vegetables, fruits, and other things. Therefore, farmers are generally unwilling and dare not oppose the warlords' orders to force the planting of opium. The International League of Nations' anti-smoking conference is about to open. The representatives of all countries attending the conference should uphold the spirit of fairness and resolutely establish a strict plan to prohibit the production of opium and its derivatives (such as morphine, heroin, and other poisons) in all countries. The result of the fragmentation of the Chinese government has not only revived the planting of opium but also made foreign trade increasingly stagnant. Chinese and foreign merchants and manufacturers of legitimate goods have suffered huge losses. At present, if the huge amount of money consumed by the smuggling and private sale of opium were used for legitimate trade, it would not only revive the domestic economy but also greatly improve legitimate trade between China and foreign countries. Recently, some have said that since opium has revived in our country today and poisons are everywhere, it would be better to legally allow the business of opium and allow foreign opium to be imported through customs in order to enrich the sources of military funds. Such proposals are absolutely inappropriate. Chinese public opinion, especially the opinion of law-abiding, peaceful, and pure people, is invariably opposed to opium. Anyone who advocates legally allowing the business of opium or showing surrender to the evil forces of opium, even if it is a temporary expedient, is a public enemy of public opinion. The domestic situation today is extremely bad, and the anti-poison movement is facing many difficulties, so the results have been very few. However, the war against opium must absolutely not be compromised or abandoned. If the responsible government agency lowers its flag and ceases fighting against opium for its own private convenience and immediate interests, it is an act of treason, no matter how long or short. In short, any surrender to the harm of opium, in any form, can be said to be a disregard for the conscience of the nation. Even the bandit-like warlords who rely on illegal opium as a source of profit dare not openly admit that opium is a legitimate business. They cannot escape the shame and the conscience-stricken rebuke of theft for their own illegal acts. Our country's interior lacks roads and the construction of various convenient transportation facilities. In addition, there are frequent warlord struggles, which result in an increasing economic burden on farmers. It is impossible for farmers to peacefully cultivate ordinary agricultural products. For example, the Guangdong Provincial Government is extremely opposed to smoking and drugs, but in addition to smuggling from neighboring provinces, there is still opium imported from abroad by sea. Under these circumstances, even a good government like Guangdong Province can hardly eliminate the illegal opium business and formulate a detailed plan to eliminate the root of the scourge. However, due to the large amount of smuggling by land and sea, it is impossible to achieve considerable practical results. From this, we can see that local actions are difficult to achieve results. To achieve the goal of smoking prohibition, the National Government must adopt a nationally consistent plan. Therefore, we should first overthrow the warlords who are more deeply harmful and more harmful, promote the establishment of the National Government, and enable it to realize the authority of democracy. Only then can smoking prohibition be effective. Today, once the scourges that hinder the lives and freedoms of the people are abolished, the power of public opinion will surely be able to achieve the goal of prohibiting opium. At present, the warlords have not been overthrown, and the democratic government has not yet unified the country. The best way to achieve the above-mentioned goal is for anti-poison groups to struggle unremittingly, continue to work on investigation and publicity, so that illegal business has nowhere to hide. Even if it may not be effective for a while, we must never give up the determination to struggle with perseverance and non-compromise, and we must always adhere to a thorough non-surrender policy."</p>

Also, since the industry's revenue accounts are mostly quarterly, and Zhejiang Province collects monthly, it is requested that this be changed. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Unfortunate Shipping Incidents on the Yangtze <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲Groundings, Reef Impacts, Bandit Encounters, Collisions</p>
<p>Due to the cold weather and shallow waters on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River recently, several vessels belonging to Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen, and China Merchants S.N. Co. have run aground or encountered bandits near Yichang. Furthermore, numerous sea-going vessels have also been involved in accidents due to fog. The news received yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲Wuling Maru (Nisshin Kisen) The Nisshin Kisen's Wuling Maru, while traveling near Tiaoguan, ran aground at the Tiaoguan entrance due to heavy snowfall obscuring the channel. Bandits on both banks immediately dispatched small boats to loot the vessel. Fortunately, soldiers of the guard detachment stationed on the ship opened fire with machine guns, repelling the bandits. The Yichang branch of Nisshin Kisen has already dispatched a vessel for rescue.</p>
<p>▲Wuxing (San Peh Steam Navigation Co.) The San Peh Steam Navigation Co.'s Wuxing encountered bandits firing upon the vessel from the riverbank near Changshou. Fortunately, due to the distance, no one was harmed. The Wuxing quickly reversed and retreated, heading towards Yichang. However, while navigating a shoal, the ship's bow struck a reef and was holed, narrowly avoiding disaster. A telegram yesterday reported minor repairs, and the vessel has since arrived in Yichang.</p>
<p>▲Yiling (China Merchants S.N. Co.) The China Merchants S.N. Co.'s Shanghai-Yichang route vessel, the Yiling, was fired upon by bandits on both banks in the Jidu area. Fortunately, the vessel quickly escaped without any injuries, but the ship's hull sustained damage.</p>
<p>▲Jiang He (Jardine Matheson) The Jardine Matheson's Jiang He ran aground near Xinlongtan, reportedly suffering damage to the hull, creating a dangerous situation. Before rescue ships dispatched by the Hankou branch arrived, local bandits gathered and began firing upon the vessel. Passengers took cover on the cabin floor. During this crisis, a Hankou tugboat arrived, and a British naval vessel also came to provide protection, causing the bandits to retreat. It was reported yesterday that the ship has been rescued.</p>
<p>▲Yuanjiang Maru (Nisshin Kisen) According to a telegram from Hankou received yesterday, the cargo in the bow compartment of the Yuanjiang Maru, which ran aground near Jiayu, has been unloaded by tugboats. All passengers have been transferred to the Dangyang Maru for transport to Yichang. The Yuanjiang Maru was rescued yesterday and is expected to arrive today.</p>
<p>▲Ning Shao (Ning Shao Steamship Company) The Ning Shao Steamship Company's Yangtze River vessel, the Ning Shao, encountered fog outside the Wusong estuary during its voyage from Shanghai. While at anchor, it was struck by an Asiatic Petroleum Company oil tanker. The Ning Shao's bow and rudder blade were damaged, but fortunately, the collision was relatively light, with only the iron plating of the bow dented and no breaches. The cargo was undamaged, and the passengers were safe. However, due to the rudder damage, the vessel was difficult to maneuver and, after negotiations with Asiatic Petroleum, returned to Shanghai, docking at Pier 16. The cargo was unloaded, a report was filed with the River Conservancy Bureau for inspection, and a claim was submitted to Asiatic Petroleum. Yesterday, Asiatic Petroleum replied to the Ning Shao Steamship Company, stating that they had not yet received a report from the ship's owner and were therefore unable to negotiate. All cargo and passengers were transferred to San Peh and Taikoo vessels today for transport to Hankou.</p>
<p>▲Weisheng (Jardine Matheson) The Jardine Matheson's Weisheng was carrying a large consignment of goods from Shanghai to Shantou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong for unloading. Numerous passengers were also aboard, heading to various ports in Southeast Asia. The vessel's departure from Shanghai was delayed due to heavy fog. After the fog cleared and the ship left port, it was approaching the first lighthouse outside Wusong when an unidentified British vessel (name unknown) emerged from the fog, heading into the Huangpu River. Although the fog had lifted, visibility was still limited. The two vessels were on a collision course, and it was not until they were very close that they sighted each other. The Weisheng urgently sounded its whistle, requesting the approaching vessel to give way, but the other vessel's speed was too great, and a collision was unavoidable. The sea-going vessel struck the bow of the Weisheng. The shipmaster quickly reversed to avoid further damage. The Weisheng sustained damage. The shipmaster reassured the passengers, turned the vessel around, and returned to Shanghai, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf. He immediately reported the incident to the head office and customs, who boarded the vessel for inspection. Fortunately, the damage was above the waterline, allowing for immediate repairs in Shanghai. The cargo was undamaged. After a two-day delay in Shanghai, the vessel departed for Guangdong yesterday afternoon after completing essential repairs to the bow.</p>
<p>▲Old Taikoo vessel (Eurylohus) The British Old Taikoo Company's Eurylohus, after transporting goods from Lvfotuan to Japan and unloading them, reloaded cargo for Shanghai. While sailing to Sanjia Water near Wusong, it encountered heavy fog. The ship dropped anchor to wait for the fog to clear. Once the fog lifted, the vessel resumed its voyage to Shanghai. At Sanjia Water, less than half an hour into its voyage, it encountered the Norwegian vessel Litiopia, en route from New York via the Suez Canal and Hong Kong to Shanghai for unloading and outbound cargo. The Litiopia was sailing out of Shanghai. The Litiopia quickly maneuvered to avoid a head-on collision, but the Eurylohus sustained damage on the side of the forehold, while the Litiopia was damaged at the bow. Both vessels have now entered port.</p>
<p>▲Kinzan Maru (Nisshin Kisen) The Nisshin Kisen's Kinzan Maru struck a reef outside Shantou. The company received a follow-up telegram stating that the ship's hull and cargo have been completely abandoned as unsalvageable. Therefore, the Soshan Maru is still recovering the crew's belongings and some cargo from the deck to be transported back to Shanghai. The Soshan's departure date will be delayed by four days.</p>
<p>▲Yichang (China Merchants S.N. Co.) The China Merchants S.N. Co.'s motor vessel, the Yichang, struck a submerged reef 50 miles from the mouth of the Huangpu River, sustaining severe damage. Due to the dangerous situation, the shipmaster intentionally grounded the vessel on a shoal to prevent total loss. The vessel was en route from Chongqing, carrying valuable merchandise and an unknown number of passengers. It is reported that the forehold is flooded, potentially damaging the cargo. The company dispatched the vessel Victoria yesterday morning to provide assistance. This vessel is one of the newest and most modern on the river, and its shipmaster, Mr. Micklos, is an experienced navigator. The vessel and cargo are reportedly insured.</p>

<p>▲Support for Reorganization and Regional Organization</p>
<p>丨Representations from Labor Union Representatives丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Committee's Mass Training Committee, for the purpose of reorganizing labor unions throughout the city, has been convening talks with labor union representatives since February 2nd, in conjunction with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. These meetings have been held separately at the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. The previous reports have documented the situation in recent days. The events of yesterday, the fifth day, are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Talks at the Municipal Party Committee Yesterday, the labor union representatives summoned to the Municipal Party Committee for talks included: Fang Mengzhou, Wang Zhouyuan, and Sun Shiqing from the umbrella industry union; Xiong Anting and Huang Weibang from the pig bristle industry union; Chen Ziming, Fu Deben, and Qian Rongfu from the silk spinning union; and Lu Laoda, Ye Gengsheng, and Zhou Weixin (representing Yunlong) from the silkworm moth union. Zhu Yakui, Huang E, Zhou Chuanong, Mao Yun, Wu Xiu, and Wu Jiazhe from the Municipal People's Training Committee divided into groups to speak with them. As a result, the labor union representatives expressed support for reorganization and regional representative organization.</p>
<p>▲Labor Unions Summoned Today The labor unions summoned to the Municipal Party Committee for talks today include: the tin industry union, the simple book industry union, the candle industry union, the Huazhuang binding industry special district union, the Huazhuang binding industry Zhabei district union, and the book cover industry union (all at 10 AM); the Hui restaurant union, the Cantonese cuisine restaurant tea and dim sum union, the Jinghu Shanghai-Hangzhou railroad catering union, the Western chef union, the lodging house Yangtze River boat hospitality union, the lodging house northern boat hospitality union, the lodging house Nanhua boat hospitality union, the northern station inland river lodging house hospitality union, the commercial station foreign river lodging house hospitality union, and the lodging house Cantonese overseas worker union (all at 1 PM); the barber industry Hunan district union, the soy sauce industry union, the coal and firewood industry union, the liquor industry worker union, and the pharmaceutical industry worker union (all at 3 PM).</p>
<p>▲Talks at the Bureau of Social Affairs In the morning, the tea room industry delegation included Xu Renyi and Sun Wenpin from the Jinghu Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Jinghang section tea and dim sum union. The newspaper distribution industry delegation included Xu Rongxiang and Mei Guozhen from the newspaper distribution union. Gu Bingyuan and Wang Youmei attended the talks. The toothbrush industry delegation included Ou Changan, Liu Zubei, and Qian Jinglü from the toothbrush union. The scale industry delegation included Ni Zhiyuan from the scale industry union. Guo Yongbing and Zhang Shuye attended the talks. In the afternoon, the comb and hairpin industry delegation included Du Guichu and Ruan Xingsheng from the comb and hairpin worker union. Gu Bingyuan and Wang Youmei attended the talks. The cleaning industry delegation included Zhang Dehua and Chen Yousong from the Hunan cleaning union, Zhu Chunsheng and Yin Desheng from the Hongkou cleaning union, Bu Yunlong and Jin Yunxiu from the Huafa cleaning union, and Jiang Yugao and Bian Jinxiang from the Zhabei cleaning union. Guo Yongxi and Zhang Shuye attended the talks. After the chairman's report, each labor union representative expressed their opinions. (1) The scale industry representatives stated that they could not gather workers for reorganization because they had all returned to their hometowns. (2) The newspaper distribution industry representatives requested that it would be best to establish one labor union for the entire city. However, during the talks, three difficulties were identified: (a) Newspaper delivery workers' delivery areas and addresses differ, making it difficult to divide by regional standards. (b) The Jinghang Railway tea room has traditionally considered the two-route labor reorganization committee as its superior, so the issue of authority should be resolved first. (c) The comb and hairpin worker union is jointly organized by shop employees and workers. Currently, the business is affected by the trend of women cutting their hair, and most workers have changed careers, leaving only shop employees to maintain union affairs, making reorganization impossible.</p>
<p>▲Labor Unions Summoned Today (Electrician industry) Water and electricity union, (Engraving industry) Sign industry union, (Ink making industry) Ink making union, (Baling industry) Baling union - all of the above will hold talks at the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Shanghai Executive Committee Requests Preferential Treatment for Liu Rongtai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲Letter to the Two-Route Railway Administration for Review</p>
<p>The entire staff of the Fire Brigade, due to the tragic death of Liu Rongtai in the line of duty, submitted a request on the first of this month to the Sixth District Party Department to forward it to higher authorities, appealing for assistance. The Shanghai Executive Committee, upon receiving the request, determined that Liu's unfortunate demise was due to the railway gate not being closed and the negligence of railway personnel. Subsequently, railway staff obstructed rescue efforts, leading to his death from exposure. The Railway Bureau should be held responsible. Furthermore, Liu was serving on a voluntary basis in the public interest, making his case unlike other accidental tragedies. The 85th Executive Committee Standing Committee resolved to send a letter to the Two-Route Railway Administration, requesting preferential compensation to console his spirit. It is anticipated that the Railway Administration will take appropriate action upon receiving the letter.</p>

<p>Da Wan Bao reports that the Chinese councilors and Chinese ratepayers association of the Shanghai Municipal Council are dissatisfied with the Council's appointment of Chinese staff to the position of Chinese Affairs Director, and are insisting that they must be appointed as Deputy Director-General.

The members of this committee consist of Director-General Macnaghten, Chairman Fessenden, and two Chinese councilors. Regarding the selection of candidates, it is reported that 25 applications have been received to date, which are currently under careful consideration by the committee.</p>

<p>▲Investigating Waterworks Company's Plan in the Settlement</p>
<p>Following the Shanghai International Settlement Waterworks Company's increase of water prices by 25%, and after vehement objections from various organizations, the company planned to employ foreign experts to investigate this plan, so as to conciliate. Reportedly, the above plan was approved by the Public Works Department, and the waterworks company has sent a cable to the American Water Works Association to employ experts to come to Shanghai to investigate the issue in the aspects of technology and business, so as to suggest opinions of improving it.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The French Concession Authorities Punish Unregistered Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲National Medicine Association Sends Letter to the French Municipal Council to Discuss the Matter</p>
<p>The French Concession is holding registration affairs of doctors, and it has been announced on Western newspapers for a while. The Chinese people did not know about it, so the French Concession authorities removed the signs of many of the Chinese medicine practitioners and brought them to the police office for punishment. As a result, the Chinese medicine community started to feel upset and reported to the National Medicine Association. Now, the National Medicine Association sends a letter to the Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council as following: Dear sirs, our Association is the only legal group organized by qualified traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Shanghai who have registered with the Hygiene Bureau. The association has registered with various party and government organs. Recently, our members residing in the French Concession reported to the association that they have not received any formal notification or seen any official announcement regarding the recent registration of doctors in the French Concession. As a result, the authorities have sent personnel to impose penalties, which is akin to punishing without warning. The members involved are understandably alarmed. After contacting the association, we found the regulations for doctor registration in the French Concession, which demonstrates your bureau's intention to rectify the situation regarding doctors and prioritize the lives of the people. We deeply admire this. However, as these regulations are still in their early stages of implementation, there are three points that should be handled with flexibility: (1) Most doctors are not yet fully aware of this registration matter. Within three months, penalties should be temporarily suspended for those who have not yet completed the procedures and obtained a license. (2) Doctors from outside the concession who come to the French Concession for consultation should be exempt from obtaining a license, as doctors from outside the concession who do not have formal medical qualifications are already subject to suppression (registration has been completed in the Chinese-administered area, and registration will be held in the Public Concession), so those who are able to practice medicine in the French Concession should have the qualifications already and it is unnecessary to register repeatedly to save the procedures. (3) The registration fee should only be paid once, as the services provided by doctors are related to the lives of people within the concession and public health, which cannot be compared to commercial activities such as vegetable vendors' permits or vehicle permits, which require regular fees. Even Chinese government authorities only charge registration fees once. We hope that the above three points will be adopted by your bureau to avoid disputes and prevent unfortunate incidents. We sincerely hope that the bureau will take appropriate actions and revert to us to be appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="e126">National Medicine Museum Announces Meeting Date by Telegram <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲March 15th</p>
<p>The national medical and pharmaceutical community, in light of the gradual decline of Chinese medicine, urgently needs to promote it for revitalization. The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations Joint Federation previously requested the government to establish a National Medicine Museum, which was approved by the Central Political Council. The preparatory office has been established and a general meeting will be held on March 15th to legally establish the Shanghai General Federation and the Shanghai National Medicine Association. The Shanghai General Federation and the Shanghai National Medicine Association have received the telegram, transcribed below: "Our country’s medicine originated in ancient times, seeking the truth. However, the essence of it is not well publicized and the Central Political Council resolved to establish a museum to organize the inherent culture with scientific methods. We request medical and pharmaceutical representatives from each province and city (3-5 persons per province, 2-1 persons per city and 1-2 persons per organization) to attend. The travel expenses for the delegates of each province, city and county medical groups are responsible. We will discuss the methods of advancing and indicate everything. With the effort of everyone, the study would not be in extinction. We are looking forward to meeting you.</p>

<p>Because the Chen Da Cloth Factory on Kang Ti Road will be terminated on the year-end day of the old calander, all the workers filed a lawsuit at the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to seek relief. The Bureau sent the order to the Factory that private termination is not allowed. After the Factory received the notice, it forced all the workers to leave the factory within 4 days. As a result, the workers filed a lawsuit for help again. The Bureau sent personnel to investigate. Yesterday at 9 a.m., the factory's representative Xu Qianyi, the employee's representative Lu Wancheng and Cheng Wentian went to the Bureau with Wang Bing as the chairman, to mediate on the case. The factory's representative required approval to terminate the factory because of bad business operation. The employee's representative agreed to terminate employment relationships because they have bad relation with the factory. Later, all the representatives from both sides agreed and signed the following agreement: The Chen Da Cloth Factory is allowed to be closed. The male and female workers like Cheng Wentian each get six yuan for the expenses to go home. The factory is allowed to terminate the employment. The room fees for the workers living in the factory is not deducted from the first day to the fifth day of the month. The chairman announced the mediation is settled.</p>

<p>▲Red Cross Society Receives Telegram Requesting Relief</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society has received a telegram from the Henan Relief Association, forwarded from the Xiping County Magistrate's Disaster Investigation Committee, stating: "To the Chinese Red Cross Society: We are reporting from the Xiping County Magistrate, Pei Ran, and the Disaster Investigation Committee, Rou Hongjun. Since 1927, bandits have been rampant and floods have occurred repeatedly, resulting in property losses of over 30 million yuan and casualties of over 8,000 people. With the end of the war against Tang, we hoped to recuperate and recover slightly. However, the war broke out again in the spring, with Xiping County close to the front lines. Added to this, the bandits and communists are still rampaging. From July to October, the civilian casualties have totaled over 2,100 people, with over 1,900 people fleeing and over 1,500 houses burned. The requisition of cash, grain, firewood, and other supplies amounts to over 280,000 yuan, with indirect losses not included. Now, with the cold weather and the end of the year, the disaster victims are scattered everywhere, and the misery is unbearable to witness. We earnestly request relief." As Xiping is close to the battlefront, the vast amounts of supplies have been creating a great burden. After these pains, the remaining people are awaiting relief. In addition to having the association provide immediate aid and comfort, we request your compassion to provide relief to the disaster victims as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Detailed Record of Lu Yifang's Appeal in the Hu Die Trial <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲ Over Two Hundred Men and Women Attended</p>
<p>▲ Lu Used Chiang Kai-shek as an Analogy</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Yiping Speaks with Hu Die</p>
<p>▲ Lu Said Hu Die's Father Should Have a Conscience</p>
<p>The "Ling Bao" newspaper published an article titled "Record of Snow and Butterfly's Marriage and Separation" on the 3rd of the month. Film actress Hu Die believed that many statements in the article slandered her reputation. She hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to send a letter to the newspaper's editor, Lu Yifang, requesting a correction. Although "Ling Bao" made a correction, they added the phrase "everything is recorded" in the correction. They also published a photo of film actor Zhu Fei, with a note stating he was a "key figure in Snow and Butterfly's divorce." Hu became even more angry and hired lawyer Zhan to file a lawsuit on her behalf, requesting that Lu be punished under Article 325 of the Criminal Code. After the conclusion of the initial trial by the Special District Court, Lu was sentenced to a fine of three hundred yuan. Lu then filed an appeal and was ordered to pay a bail of five hundred yuan while awaiting trial, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday was the date for the hearing, and so at 4:30 PM, the case was heard in the first courtroom of the Special District Court by Judge Zhou, along with assessors Cheng and Xiao. The appellant, Hu Die, wearing a yellow woolen coat, arrived at court with her father at 2:30 PM to await the hearing. The appellant, Lu Yifang, also arrived around 3:00 PM. More than two hundred men and women were in attendance. The hearing began at 4:30 PM, and the proceedings were as follows:</p>
<p>▲ "Everything is Recorded" Expresses Admission of Error</p>
<p>Judge Zhou first asked both parties their ages and addresses. Then he asked Lu Yifang what position he held at "Ling Bao." Lu replied that he was the manager and editor. The judge then asked the reason for the appeal. Lu replied that the original judgment determined that he intentionally defamed Hu Die. However, he had never met Hu Die and had no intention of defaming her. The original judgment stated that he traveled back and forth from Wuxi and that at most it was one week. The original judgment also determined that he sent the draft, which did not match the facts. After returning to Wuxi, the editing duties were entrusted to a friend as an agent. The correction draft had many definitive words, which my friend had deleted quite a bit. After it was published, Hu sent a letter requesting it and it was immediately handled. As for the phrase "everything is recorded" in the correction draft, it expressed admission of error. The original judgment determined that this phrase was unfavorable to Hu. The above are all reasons for the appeal. The other dissenting points are described in detail in the appeal statement. Please let the court review it.</p>
<p>▲ Proofreader Not Employed by Ling Bao</p>
<p>Judge Zhou then asked who submitted the article published on the 5th. Lu replied that he did not know. He only knew that his pseudonym was "King Kong." He did not know his address. He asked if "Ling Bao" should have rewarded the contributor after the manuscript was published. Lu replied that small newspapers were different from large newspapers. Most contributors to small newspapers are not paid. Moreover, this person also contributed to other newspapers. He asked how he knew. Lu replied that he also had his pseudonym in other newspapers, so he found out. He asked where the original manuscript was. Lu replied that the original manuscript was kept by the proofreader. Since this case occurred, the original proofreader has not been employed by "Ling Bao." He asked when he returned to Wuxi. Lu replied the 28th of November. He asked how many days away from the date of publication of this draft. Lu replied seven or eight days. He asked that you said two or three days in the first trial. Why do you say seven or eight days now? Lu replied that I said two or three issues in the first trial. He asked that according to you, two or three issues, two issues are six days, and three issues are nine days, which is also incorrect. He also asked what time he returned to Shanghai. Lu replied that on the 7th, he received Hu's letter requesting a correction that night, and it was too late on the 8th, so he corrected it on the 11th.</p>
<p>▲ Hard-working, Humorous Everyone</p>
<p>He asked, if you had added a statement when you corrected it, "I was away and a friend negligently published it," it would have been fine. Why did you add the sentence "everything is recorded?" According to your meaning, is it impossible to not record if you heard it? He also asked why Zhu Fei's photo was published on December 14, with the note "Key figure in Snow and Butterfly's divorce."</p>
<p>What does it mean? Lu replied that the photo was posted by the proofreader and had no meaning. As for the numbers next to the photo, it is a common practice, just like "hard-working Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek or humorous Wu Zhihui." He asked, had he been to Hu's house before publishing the article? Lu replied that he had not. He asked, but her father said that you went there and that you told him that you could help and asked them to subsidize some. Lu replied that he had never seen her father in his life. Everything he said was nonsense. If he had been there, he should have taken his business card. He asked, the article said that Hu had once entered the demimonde and worked as a small star. Do you know if she did it? Lu replied, I don't know.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Die Denies Ever Being a Concubine</p>
<p>Judge Zhou then turned to Hu Die. He asked, who is Lin Xuehuai to you? She replied, my fiancé. Have you had a contract termination? She replied, yes. He asked, why did you terminate the contract? She replied, because Lin wrote to me, saying that my reputation was not good and asked to terminate the contract with me. He asked, later, did you want him to terminate the contract, or did he want you to terminate the contract? She replied, he wanted to terminate the contract. He asked, do you and Lin often communicate? She replied, it's been six years. He asked, why did you sue Lu Yifang? She replied, Lu published defamatory material about my reputation in "Ling Bao," so I sued him. The article said that I entered the demimonde and was a concubine, which were untrue. It also said that my father was dead, relying on the Lin family for a living. My father is in court now. Isn't what the article says a joke? He asked, did Lu come to your house? She replied, he came, but I was not at home. My father received him. Lu said he could help and asked my father for a subsidy. He asked, when did he come? How do you know? She replied, he came on the evening of the 29th. My father told me.</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Yiping Questions Hu Die</p>
<p>At this point, Jiang Yiping, the appellant's representative lawyer, stood up and asked the court to ask Hu Die questions. The court permitted it, and Jiang then said to Hu, before this case was filed, Lu Yifang had come to your house twice to ask for subsidies. Did you mention this when you entrusted Lawyer Zhan to send a letter of correction? Hu replied that she did not. Jiang then asked, Lu happened to return to Wuxi when the article was published, and someone came to court to testify on his behalf. Can you provide evidence that Lu did not return to Wuxi? Hu replied that she could not prove whether or not she returned to Wuxi. Jiang then asked, since you didn't mention it and can't prove it, why did you only sue for defamation instead of suing for extortion when you filed the lawsuit? Hu replied, although Lu asked for it, I didn't suffer any loss, so I didn't sue. The defamatory article was published in the newspaper, and my reputation has been damaged, so I sued.</p>
<p>▲ There are Many Other Terrible Words in the Original Manuscript</p>
<p>The court also summoned witness Xie Hequn and ordered Xie to make an oath and said that he must be responsible for what he said after the oath. Xie testified that he was a friend of Lu and that he worked in a newspaper. When he arrived in Shanghai, Lu happened to have something to do and returned to Wuxi, so he entrusted me to edit "Ling Bao" on his behalf, from November 27 to December 7, for about three or four issues. The manuscript was an external contribution. There were many other terrible words in the original manuscript. For the sake of prudence and for the sake of Hu's reputation, I have deleted a lot of it, and then published it as a kind of rumored news. As for what happened after the 7th, I don't know.</p>
<p>▲ Don't Know Where Original Manuscript is Hidden</p>
<p>After Xie's testimony, Judge Zhou asked Lu Yifang when he returned to Shanghai from Wuxi. Lu replied on the 7th and said that he had been in the news business for many years and knew the situation of running a newspaper. This time, he really did not intend to defame Hu. He asked if the original could be retrieved now. Lu replied that the manuscript was kept by the proofreader and now he did not know where it was hidden. He asked, is what you said true? He replied, it is true.</p>
<p>▲ Eloquence of Lawyers Jiang and Zhang</p>
<p>At this point, Judge Zhou announced that the lawyers from both sides would begin to debate. First, Jiang Yiping stood up and said that Lu Yifang had just gone to Wuxi when "Ling Bao" published the manuscript, and Xie Hequn came to court to testify. Hu could not prove that Lu was still in Shanghai. Xie was able to come to court to testify for Lu, so the truth of the matter can be imagined. Lu was not in Shanghai, so he had no intention of defaming him and should not bear criminal responsibility. Even if there is criminal liability, it should be borne by the agent. Moreover, according to the provisions of the Publication Law, once corrected, the responsibility can be exempted. As for the four words "everything is recorded," it was published to correct the error of the Hu Die incident, and it also means that the newspaper's records may be wrong, and cannot bear criminal responsibility. Also, the so-called "key figure" cannot be regarded as malicious or derogatory. The "key figure" refers to the person who mediates between the two parties, which is not impossible. Moreover, the original sentence of a fine of 300 yuan is a bit excessive, so our lawyer asks the judge to revoke the original sentence and declare the appellant innocent. After Jiang finished speaking, lawyer Zhang Chongding also stood up and said that lawyer Jiang had already explained the reasons for the appeal in detail. Now I will only add a little supplement. The "Ling Bao" newspaper run by the appellant is a type of newspaper. If it is punished according to Article 325 of the Criminal Law, it seems inappropriate. Also, the Publication Law is a special law. According to the application order, it should be punished according to the Publication Law first. Please judge the appellant not guilty.</p>
<p>▲ Dali Yuan Tong Zi No. 19</p>
<p>Hu Die's representative lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, stood up and replied that the original judgment of this case was very clear. There is no need to reply to the points mentioned by lawyers Jiang and Zhang, and there is no need to reply. However, there is one point in what lawyer Jiang said just now that is a reversal of the facts, and our lawyer cannot but reply, that is, lawyer Jiang said that there is a sentence "seems to be affected" in the letter of correction, but the original letter clearly stated "indeed suffered a great influence." The judge may wish to read it. As for the date of going to Wuxi provided by the appellant, it also does not match before and after. It can be seen that his intention is nothing more than to shirk responsibility. As for the Publication Law cited, it said that after the correction, he will not be held responsible, can it overthrow the Criminal Law? According to Dali Yuan precedent Tong Zi No. 19, even if it has been corrected, it still cannot be exempt from criminal liability. Please reject the appeal and uphold the original judgment. After speaking, he presented a large book of Dali Yuan Tong Zi No. 19 to the court for review. Finally, lawyer Shi Lin represented the appellant and rebutted Lu Yifang's four grounds of appeal one by one. After the debate was over,</p>
<p>▲ Hu Die Asked to Uphold the Original Judgment</p>
<p>Judge Zhou then asked Hu Die if she had anything to say. Hu replied, please uphold the original judgment. He also asked, did you see Lu come to your house? She replied that her father told her that Lu went to my house on the evening of November 29 to ask for a subsidy. I believe my father would not lie to me.</p>
<p>▲ Yifang Denies Extortionary Behavior</p>
<p>Judge Zhou then asked Lu Yifang if he had anything to say. Lu answered at length, saying briefly that the other party accused me of intentional defamation. It should be judged whether I have been to Hu's house or not. I don't know Hu and his father, not even the direction of their home. How can I ask them for extortion? And the matter of Hu and Lin's termination of the contract has been rumored at sea, and there is nothing to hide. Therefore, there is no room for extortion in the first place. Hu's father's words, for those who are slightly knowledgeable, can be understood without thinking. It's all made up. I have always known how to love myself. Everyone I associate with is deeply aware. How can I risk this injustice and ask people for extortion? Even if I don't feel sorry for myself, I should feel sorry for my friends in general. Also, Hu's father said that on November 29, I went to his house with several companions under the pretext of interviewing, and on the 1st, I went alone to ask for a subsidy. Hu Die said that she had already asked for a subsidy on the 29th. The statements are inconsistent and can be generally seen. Also, I am still young and will plan to establish myself in society in the future and will never do this bad behavior.</p>
<p>▲ Hu's Father Speaks with White-Haired Conscience</p>
<p>Now Hu's father is old with white hair. He should speak with conscience in this court. Otherwise, he will not be subject to the restraint of conscience. I have no intention of defamation and no malice towards others. Please ask the judge to revoke the original sentence. After Lu finished speaking, Judge Zhou announced that the debate in the case was over and the sentence would be pronounced at 2 pm on the 13th. Then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Clearing of Debts of Day and Night Bank Distributed to Shareholders <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Auditor Urges Collection by Letter Again</p>
<p>In the case of the liquidation of Day and Night Bank and the Great World Tourist Savings Department, the French Concession Court has appointed auditors Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang to be responsible for handling it. At the same time, the municipal government has also stated that it will maintain it. The following are the reports from yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Creditors Petition</p>
<p>Around 4 pm yesterday, a temporary committee of creditors sent three representatives to the municipal government to petition and submit a supplementary submission, requesting the municipal government to take the lead in convening a joint meeting to handle the liquidation as soon as possible to protect the savings of the depositors. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received him and talked for about 20 minutes. According to the reporter's investigation, the municipal government is now discussing a proper solution with all parties. It is expected that a decision will be made within a few days.</p>
<p>▲ Auditor's Opinion</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter interviewed auditor Wu Zheng, who was handling the liquidation. According to him, regarding the business operations of the stores under Gongfa Company, everything is being investigated in detail. It is expected that the debts of the Chinese and Western pharmacies and hot spring locker rooms can be paid off. The Great World owes the Day and Night Bank more than 600,000 yuan, and the Tourist Savings Department owes more than 600,000 yuan, for a total debt of about 1.2 million yuan. It is not easy to pay it off immediately, but it is not difficult to gradually clear it with the profits earned over time. Although Fuchang Tobacco Company is more difficult, it is hoped that it can be reorganized. What should be clear now is how much Huang Chujiu's estate has and whether it can repay the Day and Night Bank's debt of 1.05 million yuan. Today (i.e. yesterday), we have sent a letter to lawyer Tan Yigong to ask for the estate registration form so that there is a real basis. The list of shareholders of Gongfa Company and the stock sample should also be investigated clearly. According to Mr. Yuan Lvdeng, it has been handed over to auditor Xu Yongzuo, but Mr. Xu said in a letter that it is still in the Aftermath Committee, so today (i.e. yesterday) we have also sent a letter to the committee to urge them to collect it. This matter will eventually come to light. After the shareholder list and the estate registration form are obtained, we can start to prepare a liquidation plan report and submit it to the French Concession Court for review.</p>
<p>▲ Pan Gongzhan's Conversation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit to Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau to ask for details. (Question) It is said that the municipal government will take the lead in handling this case. Is this true? (Answer) This case involves more than 13,000 depositors, with deposits totaling more than 2 million yuan, mostly from poor people's hard-earned money. This long delay is not a good plan. The municipal government is paying close attention to it. However, some creditors have filed a lawsuit with the French Concession Court, which has been accepted, and someone has been sent to keep the account books, and there is also an injunction of provisional attachment. It is heard that another group of creditors has filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court of the Public Concession. If it is accepted separately like this, it will inevitably become more chaotic and there will be no way to solve it. However, since the judicial organs have accepted the case first, if the outside world wants the administrative organs to handle it, it must go through considerable steps: (1) the creditors should submit a petition to the municipal government for a complete liquidation so that they can plan comprehensively, or (2) the debtors, i.e. the board of directors or shareholders' meeting of Gongfa Company, should submit a petition to the municipal government to take the lead in sending personnel to liquidate. If one of these conditions is met, the municipal government can probably follow the public opinion and handle it impartially. Otherwise, it seems that the municipal government is not convenient to participate in cases that are already in court. (Question) If the municipal government takes the lead in handling it in the future, will the Social Affairs Bureau handle the liquidation? (Answer) If the situation is such that the municipal government has to take the lead, the municipal government will probably send a liquidator. The Social Affairs Bureau has a lot of daily business and it is not convenient to directly handle the liquidation for a company's debt dispute. (Question) Is the name of the directors and shareholders of Gongfa Company who should be liquidated available for examination? (Answer) The directors of Gongfa Company should have come out and taken responsibility for handling it a long time ago. It is a pity that they have been unheard of for many days, which is not appropriate. The names of the directors and supervisors have been secretly investigated as follows: (Directors) Huang Chujiu, Yuan Lvdeng, Ye Shantao, Zhao Qinbo, Cao Binchen, Dai Jiezai, Zhou Songqing, etc. (Supervisors) Chen Xingwu, Zhang Huizan. As for the shareholder list, it is still being secretly investigated. (Question) What will be the liquidation policy in the future? (Answer) How to liquidate is a question for the future. However, the sole purpose of the government's supervision of liquidation is to prevent creditors from suffering losses, especially to prevent small depositors from suffering losses. To achieve this goal, we must (1) order the directors and shareholders to bear full responsibility, (2) formulate a liquidation plan as soon as possible, (3) the affiliated business institutions of Gongfa Company, such as those that can be maintained, should be maintained immediately, otherwise they will all collapse one by one, and it will be even more unthinkable, and the creditors will suffer even greater losses, (4) all of Huang Chujiu's private property should be liquidated and used to offset his outstanding debts. (Question) Can the people who owe Gongfa Company offset the debts they owe? (Answer) It is difficult to say this. The detailed accounts need to be liquidated. If it is not enough, of course the directors and shareholders will be responsible. However, it is estimated that the savings deposits received by Day and Night Bank and the Great World Savings Department amount to 3 million yuan. If the company can handle it well, it is not impossible to repay. Such as (1) the right to use the land and buildings of the Great World, if it continues to operate, or if the remaining 30-year lease right is transferred, it is heard that it is worth 800,000 to 1 million yuan, (2) the Chinese and Western pharmacies and their branches, based on their current business situation, are profitable every year, and it is heard that they are worth 250,000 yuan, (3) the hot spring bathhouse is heard to be worth 50,000 yuan, (4) Fuchang Tobacco Company, together with the Three Film Company, if it continues to operate, the trademarks and goods are heard to be</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>It can be worth about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. The above is worth about 2 million yuan in total. The only thing missing is more than 1 million yuan, which is the money Huang Chujiu personally owes the Day and Night Bank. However, according to yesterday's newspaper report, lawyer Tan Yigong said that Huang's antiques, jade articles, calligraphy, paintings, and other family properties and houses are worth about 1 million taels, which is enough to offset all kinds of debts. Although it is not yet convenient to believe whether it is true, there are always some results that are not far off. If there is still not enough, then each director will be responsible for compensating for the amount that is not much, and the managers of the affiliated business institutions have a deep friendship with Huang and will give some assistance to Li Chu for the sake of the aftermath. If all parties can write their duties and there is a unified management agency, it is not difficult to have a better result, although it may not be as satisfactory as everyone wants. It is better than the current panic.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Record of the Trial of Xia Shaoen, the Murderer in the Zhao Assassination Case <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲ Bodyguard and Chauffeur Testify in Court</p>
<p>▲ Xia Confesses, Then Retracts, Awaiting Retrial</p>
<p>In the case of the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Xia Shaoen was captured by the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, and Wang Jinshan (i.e. Wang Laosan) and Cheng Haibo were captured by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Executive Yuan ordered them to be sent to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Xia Shaoen was sent to the court at the end of last year, so the prosecutor investigated him first and filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of premeditated murder.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony of Bodyguard Liu Hua</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Tieqiao opened the first courtroom for trial and first interrogated the witnesses. According to Zhao's bodyguard, Liu Hua, on the day of the incident, at 9:00 am, because his wife wanted to buy things at the New New Company, they went together. I sat with the chauffeur Shen Ashan to the front of the General Bureau. I got out of the car first. The general manager got out of the car and went inside. I was closing the car door when I heard a gunshot. I turned around and saw a person walking out of it, wearing a striped short shirt. I forgot what color the stripes were. His pants were either blue or black, and I don't remember. At this time, a person wearing a blue short shirt and pants shot at me, piercing the leather bag I was carrying. I blew the police whistle. He asked where the general manager was shot. He replied that the bullet entered the right waist and exited the front chest.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony of Chauffeur Shen Ashan</p>
<p>The chauffeur Shen Ashan also testified that he went to Zhao's office in January of the 18th year of the Republic of China and was paid 35 yuan per month. On the day of the incident, there were three people in the car, one general manager, one wife, and one bodyguard sitting next to me. The car stopped, and the general manager got out and went inside. I was looking at the car door when I heard a sound, which I thought was a rickshaw tire blowing out. At this time, I heard the wife say that something had happened to the general manager. I turned around and looked inside. I saw the general manager running up the escalator. At that time, a man in a striped cloth shirt was holding a gun and fleeing towards the Puxi side. I blew the police whistle. Then I heard another gunshot. I looked back and saw that the bodyguard had fallen to the ground. I saw that this person was of medium height and had a black face. When I parked the car, there was a man in a black long shirt with a small face next to the car, but I didn't pay attention. Later, Section Chief Zhang helped the general manager from the escalator into the car and sent him to Baolong Hospital. The wife got out of the car and stayed at the bureau. I went with the bodyguard. When the car arrived at Xizang Road, Zhao suddenly asked if you knew where Mr. Fan Zhengbo was treated before. I said I knew it was the Red Cross, so I immediately turned to the Red Cross.</p>
<p>▲ Testimony of Miscellaneous Servants and Patrolmen</p>
<p>According to Wu Deshan, a servant at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, I am a servant who opens the door and sweeps the floor. On the day of the incident, I was inside, so I didn't know. According to Wang Shifu, the gatekeeper, I heard a gunshot and the general manager went upstairs. At that time, I thought the tire had blown out. When I heard the second sound, I ran out. The bodyguard had fallen to the ground, and the murderer was gone. I am in charge of the front door. There are four of us colleagues, one at the front door, one at the back door, one in the general manager's office, and one on the night shift.</p>
<p>▲ Xia Shaoen's Confession</p>
<p>At this point, the official ordered Xia Shaoen to be brought to court. According to his confession, he is 36 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, and lives at No. 1750 Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, because his hometown was barren, he came to Shanghai with his mother and wife. He first sold vegetables. Later, a friend surnamed Wang recommended him to be a police officer in the Fifth District. Because he couldn't speak the local dialect, they thought he was stupid, so he quit after February. Later, he sold vegetables again. The following year, Gong Shaolan and Xu Caiyuan, fellow villagers, introduced me to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as a soldier in the roving patrol team, with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. There were one or two hundred people in total, stationed in Pudong. I didn't have a gun. The captain's name was Hu Yuqing. It was disbanded in October of the 18th year. After that, he still worked as a vegetable seller. In June of last year, he went to Hefei for medical treatment due to illness and came out in September. Wang Laosan, who is now in the same case, met in March. Because he sold vegetables past his door, he knew that he was a fellow villager. The official asked if Wang Laosan called you to kill someone. He replied that it was not the case. He asked if you admitted in the Public Security Bureau that Wang Laosan called you to Shanghai from Anhui. You didn't have any money. He bought you two yuan of rice and gave you a box gun. You said that if you killed someone, you would have to pay with your life. He said that if you didn't kill someone, you wouldn't thrive, and you would kill your whole family. How do you explain this? He replied that he was forced to confess after being beaten severely. He asked how you admitted it three times in the Procuratorate of this court. He replied that the secret agent told me to admit to it three times and was tricked by him. The official rebutted him again and ordered him to wait for retrial. The defendant was sent back to prison.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Mei Fei is Not Guilty <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sentence in Appeal Case Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>In the case where prostitute Mei Fei was accused by Tan Meiying of colluding with Hu San to embezzle her husband Zhao Guangzu's land ownership form, the initial trial sentenced Mei Fei to two months' imprisonment with probation and ordered her to return the ownership form. Mei Fei refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Shen Xiangshan to file an appeal. In the meantime, because Tan and Zhao had a divorce lawsuit, the case was suspended. Recently, Tan and Zhao restored their relationship, and Tan appeared in court as the appellant. After the High Court's final hearing, the court opened yesterday afternoon, and Judge Song and assessors Zhu and Gao announced that the original judgment was revoked and Chen Junxia (Mei Fei) was not guilty. The judge was afraid that Tan Fang would not accept the judgment and would file a third-instance appeal, so he instructed Mei Fei to pay the original bail during the appeal period.</p>

<p>▲ Conversation with Important Officials</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council sent a letter to Ming Shen and Liang Yuan the day before yesterday, notifying them that dog racing in the Public Concession must be stopped after March 31, without any possibility of accommodation, a reporter from Zi Lin Bao visited an important official of the Municipal Council, who said that the Council believes that this measure must be implemented on schedule and will no longer negotiate with the two parks through correspondence. It is hoped that the persons in charge of the two parks can comply with the Council's decision and close them at midnight at the end of next month. If they do not comply, the Municipal Council will officially withdraw its protection and send patrolmen to guard the entrances of the two parks, and all roads will be prohibited from entering and exiting. At that time, it is expected that the two parks will have no objection. According to rumors from the outside world, the two parks are now seeking all practical legal judgments.</p>

<p>▲ Russian Con Man's Elaborate Scheme Failed</p>
<p>▲ Danish Woman Fortunately Not Fooled</p>
<p>A 35-year-old Russian con man named Robert Spier used a small wooden box containing mud, stones, and a large block of hardened cement weighing over sixty pounds. The box was sealed to resemble one shipped from another city. He transported it to an apartment rented by a Danish woman, Marna Snethlage Graham, located at No. 70, Lane 589, Route Lafayette in the French Concession. He told the landlady that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Harbin and that the box contained over ten thousand silver dollars. He asked for a receipt, saying he needed to go to the pier to retrieve his luggage. The landlady, believing him, wrote the receipt. Robert then pretexted that he was going to retrieve his luggage. Later that evening, he called the landlady from a store on Avenue Joffre, claiming that he was at the Jianghai Customs House retrieving his luggage and needed to pay over seven hundred silver dollars in customs fees, but was short one hundred ninety silver dollars. He asked if she could lend him the money, promising to return it upon his return to the apartment. The landlady replied that it was late and she didn't have that much money on hand. Robert was greatly disappointed. The landlady became suspicious when Robert did not return after a long time. She reported the matter to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to the apartment. They opened the wooden box and discovered the scam. The Western detectives apprehended Robert, and he was brought before the French court yesterday for questioning. The Western detective chief reported the details of the case and stated that the defendant had a prior record in the International Settlement. The plaintiff then recounted the details of the attempted fraud. When questioned, Robert Spier admitted his intention to deceive. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced the defendant to one month in the Western jail, followed by permanent expulsion from the French Concession.</p>

Yesterday, Judge Ge Zhitan presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that defendant Cao Zilian was involved in the kidnapping of the paint merchant Wu Meiji. Wu lived at No. 646 New Zha Road, but went to the Wulongchi Bathhouse on Tianjin Road every night. On the evening of April 18, 1929, at 9 PM, Wu was kidnapped as he left the bathhouse and forced into his own car, license plate No. 4468. The driver, Chen Quanlin, was forced to drive to Route Petain in the French Concession, where he was ordered out of the car. The car was then driven directly to Rihui Harbor and hidden in a small boat. Wu's family paid a large ransom for his release. Defendant Cao Zilian had confessed to the kidnapping at the police station and should be investigated. The plaintiff, Wu Meiji, was absent. Lawyer Jiang Yiping appeared on his behalf, stating that Wu had a history of mental illness and took baths daily.

<p>Educational News in Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e155">Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Chinese Education <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>▲ Many Favor Subsidizing Existing Schools</p>
<p>▲ Concrete Proposals to be Presented Before the Annual Meeting of Western Ratepayers</p>
<p>▲ Budget of at Least 250,000 Taels</p>
<p>▲ Increased Taxes Earmarked for Education</p>
<p>The China Press reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council, at its regular board meeting on Wednesday, meticulously discussed the Education Committee's ambitious plan to increase educational opportunities for Chinese residents in the Settlement and registered its approval in the minutes. However, as the plan would necessitate an increase in taxes, it will be submitted to the annual meeting of Western ratepayers for a decision. At the same time, the Council will announce in detail the reasons for its support to the Western ratepayers, so that the ratepayers may be more aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the plan. It is reported that during the board discussion of the matter, the issue of funding was considered at length. The chief accountant stated that the Council had many municipal projects within the Settlement requiring investment, and expenses were increasing daily. He believed that the required funds for the plan could only be met by increasing taxes. However, he did not support increasing taxes. He suggested accepting the principles of the plan but modifying its implementation. One director immediately objected, believing that the demand for the Council to provide educational opportunities for Chinese residents would eventually exceed the current plan and that increased taxes were the only way to meet this need. Another commissioner stated that Chinese ratepayers contributed a significant amount to educational funds within the Settlement, and the educational opportunities currently afforded to Chinese residents could not be considered adequate compensation for this contribution. As there was an urgent need to increase and expand educational opportunities, efforts should be made to meet their expectations. He had consulted with Chinese residents, who would not object to increased taxes if they were earmarked for educational purposes. Another commissioner suggested implementing the plan with the schools listed in this year's budget and submitting it to the Western ratepayers' meeting before fully adopting it. However, the Director-General disagreed, arguing that if the Western ratepayers rejected the plan, it would cause a backlash from the Chinese community and put the Council in a difficult position. After further discussion, it was decided to accept the principles of the plan and to publish its contents in detail before the Western ratepayers' annual meeting, clearly expressing the Council's support for the plan. The funds for the plan would be separated from ordinary government expenses and funded by increased taxes. Regarding the subsidy for existing schools, the chief accountant stated that the Education Committee had not yet proposed a specific amount. He tentatively listed 50,000 taels in the budget. One director stated that the Education Committee had expressed agreement in principle to first present concrete proposals and then prepare a budget. He estimated that the cost would be at least 250,000 taels. As a result, the directors largely favored subsidizing existing schools for economic reasons, thereby reducing capital expenditures on increasing educational opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Gu Shusen, Zhu Yingpeng, and Cen Dezhang Ordered to Take Over China Public School <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Receive it Today</p>
<p>▲ Ma Junwu Prepares to Hand Over</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency) Following the student unrest at China Public School, the Ministry of Education dispatched personnel to investigate and then appointed Shang Shusen, Zhu Yingpeng, and Cen Dezhang as temporary takeover committee members to carry out reorganization. Some details were reported yesterday. We now understand that the three committee members, including Mr. Gu, received a directive from the Ministry of Education yesterday, along with the official seal of the committee's office, ordering them to take over the school as soon as possible. It is said that Mr. Gu and the others have decided to travel to Wusong this morning to take over the school. Ma Junwu has prepared to hand over the school and has appointed two staff members to handle the handover today. The original text of the Ministry of Education's directive to Gu Shusen, Zhu Yingpeng, and Cen Dezhang, as well as the rules of the committee's office, are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Directive from the Ministry of Education: Upon investigation, China Public School, a private institution, has experienced repeated disturbances in recent months. Since the board of directors approved Principal Ma Junwu's resignation, the school's internal affairs have disregarded the board's resolutions. Students have arbitrarily welcomed or rejected candidates for principal, and have formed illegal organizations to interfere with school affairs, even leading to fighting. The Ministry has repeatedly received orders from the Executive Yuan to investigate and handle the matter, and has also received reports and telegrams from various parties regarding the school's current situation. We have already dispatched personnel to the school to investigate. According to reports, the school has not followed the Ministry's orders regarding party education, and the students' thinking is complex, with factions and divisions. The school's internal order is chaotic, and it is almost in a state of being without leadership. Furthermore, according to a report from Cai Yuanpei, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and board members Gao Yihan, Wang Yunwu, Liu Binglin, Yang Xingfo, and Ding Yiyin, regarding the process of re-electing the principal, and noting that the school's disputes are worsening and that they cannot bear to sit idly by, nor can they maintain order, they have resigned from the board of directors. Upon reviewing the report, the school has not respected the board's resolutions and has rejected the board's takeover of the school. With such repeated disputes, discipline has been lost, the foundation of the school is shaken, and no one is taking responsibility. The school should be disbanded immediately. However, considering that the school has been established for over twenty years, we cannot allow the disturbances of a few individuals to cause the school to disappear. In addition to urging the resigning board members to consider the school's future and not to lose heart, we have formulated the "Rules of the Temporary Takeover Committee Office of China Public School," established the "Temporary Takeover Committee Office of China Public School," and appointed Gu Shusen, Zhu Yingpeng, and Cen Dezhang as temporary takeover committee members for the school, designating Gu Shusen as the permanent committee member, to temporarily take over the school and carry out reorganization. All school organizations and illegal groups will be disbanded. The contracts previously issued to the school's faculty and staff will be suspended. The start of the school term will be postponed to March 1. The hiring of faculty and staff and the admission of students should be handled separately after the new principal issues new contracts and announcements. During the takeover period, the takeover committee members will be responsible for all school affairs. The takeover committee members will convene meetings with various school officials within one week to plan a solution and submit it to the Ministry for approval. In addition to issuing separate orders to the school's board of directors and replying to the school, we will also notify the Shanghai Municipal Government. We are issuing a copy of the "Rules of the Temporary Takeover Committee Office of China Public School" and ordering compliance. We are also issuing an official seal for use and to demonstrate credibility. The date of use should be reported for record-keeping. You should also notify the students. This order is issued on February 5, the twentieth year of the Republic of China, by Jiang Zhongzheng, concurrently serving as Minister of Education.</p>
<p>▲ Rules of the Committee Office: In addition to dispatching personnel to take over the school, the Ministry of Education has also formulated a set of rules for the takeover committee's office, which were promulgated on the 5th of this month. A copy of the order was issued to each takeover committee member. The full text is recorded below: Rules of the Temporary Takeover Committee Office of China Public School (1) The Ministry of Education has established the Temporary Takeover Committee Office of China Public School (hereinafter referred to as "the Office") for the purpose of temporarily taking over and reorganizing the school's affairs until a new principal is produced and assumes office. (2) The Office shall consist of three members appointed by the Minister of Education to take over, reorganize, and preside over all school affairs. The Office shall have one permanent committee member designated by the Minister of Education from among the committee members. (3) The committee members of the Office shall come to the school daily to jointly handle school affairs. The permanent committee member shall be stationed at the school regularly. On Sundays and holidays, the committee members shall take turns or designate a representative to work at the school. (4) The committee members of the Office may convene meetings of the board of directors, faculty, and staff when necessary and may formulate various meeting rules and submit them to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. (5) The committee members of the Office shall submit important matters to the Ministry of Education for approval before implementation. (6) The Office shall have one to two secretaries appointed by the Minister of Education from among the staff of the Ministry of Education to assist the permanent committee member in the takeover period. (7) The committee members and secretaries of the Office shall be paid by their original institutions and shall not receive additional salary from the school. However, they may be reimbursed for expenses incurred on official business, with actual receipts. (8) The Office may establish other staff positions, which shall be appointed by the permanent committee member. The number and salary of these positions shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. (9) The expenses of the Office shall be temporarily advanced by the Ministry of Education and shall be reimbursed by China Public School in the future. (10) These rules shall be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education. (11) The committee members and secretaries of the Office shall be relieved of their duties on the day the new principal arrives at the school, and the Office shall be dissolved at the same time.</p>
<p>▲ Report from Chairman Cai and Others to the Ministry of Education: On May 5, the 19th year, the Board of Directors of China Public School held a temporary meeting and elected Mr. Ma Junwu to succeed as Principal of China Public School. However, at a temporary meeting of the Board of Directors on June 8 of the same year, Principal Ma submitted his resignation due to a construction project. The attending directors declined his resignation. On October 7 of the same year, he again applied for resignation at the sixth meeting of the board of directors and was again persuaded to stay. On October 30 of the same year, the Board of Directors, due to the occurrence of disputes in the school that urgently needed to be addressed, and because Principal Ma had traveled far to Japan, had no choice but to convene a temporary meeting to discuss solutions. Yunwu had previously been entrusted by Principal Ma to submit his resignation to the directors on his behalf. The board of directors believed that Principal Ma had repeatedly expressed his intention to resign, and this time he entrusted Yunwu to submit his resignation on his behalf, and at a time when disputes were arising in the school, he had drifted away, and his intention to resign was undoubtedly firm. However, the situation in the school at that time could not be without someone responsible for reorganizing it, so it was resolved that "Principal Ma's determination to resign is acknowledged, and Mr. Yu Youren is appointed as the new principal." On November 10 of the same year, Principal Yu came to the school to inspect it once and expressed his unwillingness to take office, and sent a letter of resignation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, but he went to Shaanxi on official business, and former Principal Ma returned to the school with him to preside over it. On January 26 of this year, the Nanjing Central Daily News and the Shanghai Shen Bao on January 27 reported that Mr. Ma told reporters that he was suffering from the lack of a successor, and he also expressed the same to the investigators sent by the Ministry. Therefore, the Standing Director and former Principal Ma negotiated and proposed that the Chairman, representing the Board of Directors, take over the school and formulate general measures. On January 31, he received a letter from former Principal Ma, stating that "after careful consideration, he felt that the situation was very unfavorable and feared that it would cause a major conflict between the students and the Board of Directors." On the same day, two so-called student representatives came to Mr. Jiemin's private residence and left a note, stating that "the entire student body has resolved that if a third party becomes the principal during this student unrest, they will swear to reject it to the death. At the same time, we do not recognize that Principal Ma has resigned," etc. Since then, the school's disputes have become more and more serious. Jiemin and others could not bear to sit idly by and had no power to maintain order, so they had no choice but to resign at a temporary meeting of the Board of Directors on the 2nd of this month. Their resignation has been accepted, and Jiemin and others have been relieved of their responsibility for China Public School. Therefore, they have prepared this document to report, and they have also recently received a respectful telegram from the Ministry inquiring about the recent developments of the Board of Directors. They have especially summarized the main points and respectfully submit them to the Ministry of Education for review. Chairman of the Board of Directors of China Public School, Cai Yuanpei, former Directors Gao Yihan, Liu Binglin, Wang Yunwu, Ding Yiyin, Yang Xingfo.</p>
<p>▲ Reply from the Ministry of Education to Chairman Cai and Others: Chairman Cai, and forwarded to Directors Wang Yunwu, Yang Xingfo, Gao Yihan, Liu Binglin, and Ding Yiyin, all acknowledged. The report received three days ago has been understood. The selection and re-election of the principal of a private school is the responsibility of the Board of Directors. The student unrest that has occurred at the school, with students arbitrarily expressing welcome or rejection of candidates for principal, and their actions being excessive and inappropriate, has been reported by personnel dispatched by the Ministry. It is now stated in the report that the Chairman of the Board of Directors intends to represent the Board of Directors in taking over the school, but former Principal Ma stated in a letter that "he feels that the situation is very unfavorable and fears that it will cause a major conflict between the students and the Board of Directors." Moreover, according to a letter left by student representatives, they even claimed that they would swear to oppose a third party becoming principal. Such brazen and reckless behavior, disregarding the law, and rejecting the Board of Directors' takeover, disregarding the status of the Board of Directors, cannot be tolerated under any circumstances for the sake of rectifying the school's atmosphere. The school itself has lost its basis for existence and should be disbanded immediately to rectify the academic atmosphere and maintain the rule of law. However, because the school has been established for over twenty years, it is not appropriate to allow the intentional disturbances of a few individuals to cause this historical institution to disappear. We have now appointed Gu Shusen, Cen Dezhang, and Zhu Yingpeng as temporary takeover committee members of the school to temporarily take over the school's affairs and carry out reorganization so that the Board of Directors can exercise its powers without being obstructed. The Chairman and Directors have a deep connection to the school and are expected to consider the school's future, dispel their resignation, and maintain their original intentions. The Chairman should promptly convene all directors to discuss the school's solution and re-elect a principal to take charge, so that the Ministry can show its utmost concern for the school. The request to be relieved of responsibility for China Public School should not be considered. In addition to separately ordering the school's Board of Directors, this telegram is sent to you for your information. (The text of the separate order to the Board of Directors is omitted as it is similar and redundant).</p>

<p>Since the emergence of practice painting exhibitions in Shanghai, this 5th practice exhibition of the White Goose Painting Research Institute is truly at the highest level. The institute has been established for two years and has always sought to enrich its content. The meticulousness of its research equipment and the detailed instructions are unmatched by other domestic institutions. The excellence of the researchers' achievements is what one would expect. This painting exhibition was originally scheduled to close on the 6th, but due to the unique painting style, neat arrangement, and the constant stream of visitors, and because the institute also noted that there was much rain during the exhibition, and some people still wished to visit but lacked the opportunity, it has been specially extended for two days, until this Sunday.</p>

<p>▲ Tomorrow at 1:00 PM, All Players Will Be Photographed</p>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Amateur Football Competition at the Municipal Public Sports Field has a total of sixty-five participating teams this year. The players are all amateur members of the industry and commerce sectors, with a particularly large number from the working class. After careful review by the competition committee, they were divided into five groups: "Sharing Health and Happiness." Because many groups contained too many teams, the round-robin competition would take too long. Therefore, each group was further divided into several subgroups. After each subgroup completes its round-robin matches, the winning teams will compete in the finals to determine the champion. Tomorrow (Sunday) at 10:00 AM, representatives of each participating team are invited to come to the field to draw lots for division. At 1:00 PM, all team players will be gathered to take a photo together as a souvenir. For the photo, a trapezoidal long platform with eight levels will be built in the field, accommodating over a thousand people. The committee has already notified each team to inform all players to wear their team uniforms and shoes and participate in the photo, and to bring their team flag for identification. When the teams arrive at the field, they should first register at the office to determine the order of arrangement.</p>

<p>Football Victory Over All-Stars ▲ Score of 2 to 1 丨 Fifth Battle 丨</p>
<p>▲ Unfair Referee Enrages the Crowd</p>
<p>▲ Almost Leading to a Major Sino-Philippine Disturbance</p>
<p>The brave Jinan football players, who were on a solitary expedition and had won several battles, fought the Philippine All-Star Football Team on January 28 at 4:30 PM. Our army harbored the ambition to conquer all, hoping to secure another victory against this strong enemy and sing a song of triumph. The opposing side wanted to make a final struggle, hoping to leave a mark of honor in the football world. Therefore, this final match was even more intense than the previous ones. No wonder the spectators from both sides surged like a tide.</p>
<p>▲ President of the Chinese Education Association Exhorts the Troops</p>
<p>In order to win this final victory, the overseas Chinese community had high hopes. Therefore, they publicly elected Mr. Lin Xijin, President of the Education Association, to visit and comfort the brave soldiers at the main camp before their departure, and he encouraged them even more, boosting their morale. They drove to the front line in a mighty fashion at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Opponent's Strength is Empty Reputation</p>
<p>The players this time were based on those who attended the previous Far Eastern Football Games, and they also selected top players from various schools to join, with many of Spanish descent. Each of them looked mighty, showing 120% fighting ability. Therefore, they were called the Philippine All-Star Team. But when the sun comes out, all the stars dim.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Wo Valiantly Succeeds in an Instant</p>
<p>When the time came, the whistle blew, and our army faced the sun in formation. The center forward Dai passed the ball and commanded the entire army to take a flanking position, attacking the enemy's goal. Dai dribbled the ball quickly, knowing that the opponent would be prepared for a long shot. Therefore, after dodging the enemy's midfielder, he passed it to Fu Hexuan. Fu dribbled for a few steps and then passed it to Dai. Dai knew that the enemy would be closely monitoring him and that the black general was closely following behind, so he deliberately let the ball go. The black general had already understood the plan and quickly hooked the ball with his left foot. The ball flew into the right corner with great force. Their cooperative spirit was such. Since the few matches, success had never been so quick. The enemy's iron gate, praised as the best in the Philippines, did not dare to raise its head after this strike. Since they were called the All-Star Team, they were naturally not easy to deal with. They did not lose heart due to one failure. The forwards, taking advantage of the kick-off, tried their best to counterattack, but they were all blocked by our brave defenders, General Ma and Jiang Shanqing.</p>
<p>▲ Long-Legged Immortal Displays His Supernatural Powers</p>
<p>Since the enemy's fierce attack was unsuccessful, our side took advantage of their slightly loose formation. The five forwards counterattacked at the same time. Center forward Dai received a pass from Mei and went straight to the center. The enemy goalkeeper kicked it back. Before long, Black General dribbled forward, forcing his way to within ten yards of the goal and shooting. The ball hit an enemy player and bounced out. After struggling for a long time, Shu Tang showed his skill of high kicks and long shots, but the enemy goalkeeper caught it and kicked it out. At this time, our side was besieging the enemy city, and the ball shadows were all aimed at the enemy's goal. Their iron gate was agile and defended effectively, so the fortified city was not captured again. After a while, Center forward Dai received a pass from Luo Haiguang and immediately passed it to Black General. Black General immediately sped up and shot hard, but the enemy goalkeeper dove to catch it. Long-Legged Immortal received the ball from General Ma and shot from over thirty yards. The enemy goalkeeper failed to catch it, and the second city was captured by our army again. Before long, the first half ended, and our army won by a large margin of 2 to 0.</p>
<p>▲ Both Sides Fought Bravely Without Ceasing</p>
<p>After the break, the battle resumed, and our side rose with divine power, hoping to honor Long-Legged Immortal with a chicken egg. Long-Legged Immortal got the ball on the right and tried a long shot again, but unfortunately, he used too much force and the ball went over the goal. The enemy, being in a losing position, also tried their best to counterattack in order to salvage the situation. Therefore, they launched several fierce counterattacks. Fortunately, our side had a solid defense. At this time, the ball was passing back and forth almost without rest. Once, Black General received a pass from Mei Hongbao and shot with force, while Luo Haiguang and Chen Bingxiang also launched surprise attacks. These were our army's last two attacks, but they were not successful. Who knew that disaster would strike ten minutes before the end of the match?</p>
<p>▲ Referee Suspected of Being Unfair</p>
<p>The enemy, fighting for these last ten minutes, had their right winger get the ball, dribble, and go straight in. He kicked it with great force, and the ball went out of bounds on the right corner. When Xie Quanhe went out to pick up the ball, the referee was still ten yards away. The reporter personally saw an enemy player on the ground pointing to the right corner. The referee immediately blew his whistle and also pointed to the right corner. Our coach, Mr. Wu Yanzhang, who was a linesman on the battlefield at the time, held a flag and wore a uniform, and argued briefly. However, he submitted to the referee's decision and was penalized with a corner kick. The crowd was dissatisfied and shouted loudly. During this dispute, the players did not pay much attention, so the ball was kicked in. Our side had no objections. As soon as we picked up the ball to go back to the center, a Spanish man who was close to the field pushed Mr. Wu Yanzhang hard, and our audience was filled with anger.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Lin Zhuguang Righteously Argues</p>
<p>When Mr. Lin saw that Mr. Wu had been insulted, he thought that the Spanish were bullying our people too much, so he came forward to argue. Yang Shuhui, a member of the Zhuguang basketball team, also came forward to help Mr. Lin. A police officer arrived, and instead of trying to peacefully resolve the situation, he pushed Mr. Lin hard. Yang wanted to argue, but the police officer blew his whistle, and many police officers rushed over, threatening to arrest people. At that time, the crowd was filled with anger and shouted "Fight!" Some people threw chairs high in the air. The order in the field was chaotic. Because a firecracker was set off at the carnival, women and children became even more frightened. Because the crowd was not under control, one person's recklessness would lead to a collapse like a flood. Therefore, the police arrested any Chinese they saw, and the Chinese beat any Filipinos they saw. Athlete Lin Songfa originally wanted to mediate, but the police also wanted to arrest him. Chen Zhang'e wanted to explain and was also about to be arrested. Overseas Chinese businessman Li Fengrui quickly told the police that if there was any problem, he was willing to go to the police headquarters with Mr. Chen and would not escape. On the one hand, conscious overseas Chinese jointly maintained order. A storm was calmed down in an instant.</p>
<p>▲ Major Negotiations at the Police Station</p>
<p>The police arrested eight Chinese and one Filipino and sent them to the headquarters. At this time, Lin Zhuguang, Zheng Yong'an, and reporters from various newspapers, dozens of people in total, arrived at the police station. Consul General Kuang also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. He personally met with the police chief and asked him to release both sides of the detainees to avoid further escalating the conflict. The police chief declined, saying that one police officer had been injured and that the police officers had many complaints about the overseas Chinese. He said that he wanted to hand the case over to the court for resolution. At this time, lawyer Yang Xigao (a prominent member of the city council), a student of the overseas Chinese, responded to Lin Zhuguang's request and, in his capacity as a lawyer, guaranteed the release of the detainees. Liu Qinggao, the consul general of the charity association (also a student of the overseas Chinese), also tried his best to mediate. By the morning of the 29th, charges against six people were dropped, but two people had to await court resolution.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen Yalou of my hometown, practiced medicine during his lifetime. In his medical practice, regardless of rich or poor, near or far, he was not meticulous about the amount of consultation fees. If it was a family in abject poverty, even if it was an external ailment, he would not accept consultation fees or medicine costs. If it was an internal ailment, he would sometimes even provide funds for the family to purchase medicine and coal for boiling it. After prescribing the medicine, he would instead give them money to buy medicine and coal. Or, if he saw a family without mats in the summer or blankets in the winter, he would give them money to buy mats and blankets. Such was his lifelong medical practice. Therefore, during one serious illness, he had died for several hours. The family had already prepared clothing, bedding, and a coffin, but Mr. Chen suddenly revived. From then on, he did even more good deeds. In his later years, in addition to providing free consultations and medicine, he also repaired bridges and roads in the surrounding villages. He realized that one person's strength was limited, so he gathered twelve gentlemen and merchants in the village to establish the "Tongshan Benevolent Society." Each member of the society would contribute funds annually to build a stone bridge, with the goal of building twelve stone bridges within twelve years to benefit travel in the surrounding villages. Unfortunately, before the work was even half completed, Mr. Chen suddenly passed away, unable to see its success. Mr. Chen only possessed a modest amount of property, but whenever there were floods or droughts in various places, he would not hesitate to donate generously to relief efforts. He was so fond of doing good deeds. This is truly rare and commendable. In the Xinhai year of the Xuantong era, Mr. Chen and a Mr. Lu jointly purchased a house belonging to a certain family on Gongjia Road. In the first year of the Republic of China, they moved to Gongjia Road. The house faced the town in the front and bordered the river in the back, with two main halls in the front and back, and wing rooms on the left and right. Mr. Chen lived in the right wing room, while the left wing room was rented out by Mr. Lu. The left wing room belonged to Mr. Lu, and the right wing room belonged to Mr. Chen. The front and back halls were jointly owned by both families. After Mr. Chen passed away two years ago, his family did not bury him. His coffin was placed in the back hall. On the evening of the 25th of last month, Mr. Wan, a tenant in Mr. Lu's room, was careless with fire, and a fire broke out in the left wing room, erupting through the roof. The fire was spreading rapidly. When the fire started, the wind was blowing directly towards the back hall. The front hall was completely engulfed in flames, and the back hall bordered the river, making it impossible to move the coffin. Just as the family was in a state of panic, the back hall also caught fire. They were left to let it happen naturally. Who knew that when the fire reached the back hall, the wind, which had been blowing southwest, suddenly changed direction to southeast, swirling around. The fire was extinguished. Upon inspection afterward, Mr. Lu's left wing room was completely destroyed, while the front and back halls only had a few rafters burned, forming a narrow alley. Mr. Chen's property and coffin were not damaged. Some say this was due to Mr. Chen's lifelong good deeds. The Buddhist saying of cause and effect is indeed believable.</p>

<p>Beiping was the former imperial capital of past emperors. Its historical sites and artifacts are enough to evoke a sense of nostalgia for the past. The most notable is the recent excavation of a 300-year-old ancient cannon. This ancient cannon was buried in the ground. This time, the Ping Municipal Works Bureau started construction to build roads and discovered it. A total of seventy cannons were found. The cannons were engraved with the names of Wu Sangui, Chen Guodong, etc. The antique color is mottled, which is indeed an old object from 300 years ago and is extremely precious. It is heard that after the ancient cannons were unearthed, the municipal government has displayed it at the Relics Preservation Office, so that people can visit and appreciate for evaluation and preservation.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Fuzhou Hot Springs Jia Qing <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Huaqing Hot Springs, where the emperor granted bathing in the spring cold, has been passed down as a beautiful story for thousands of years. And Nanjing's Tangshan, since the capital was established, has become famous because party and state officials often took their vacations here. Only the hot springs of Fuzhou are rarely known. I have traveled in Fujian for two years and often go to bathe there. I will record it in the Free Talk.</p>
<p>The northeast gate of the Fujian city wall is called Tangmen, named after Tangquan (hot spring). The spring lies dormant in the ground. Along Tangmen, bathhouses are lined up. They all dig wells to extract the spring. The spring gushes out like boiling water, with steaming vapor, like the steam above a pot. A winch is installed on the well, and the liquid is led into the pipe, and then into each room. The water is very hot and needs to be mixed with cold water for bathing. As for the bathrooms in the Wangzhuang Nantai area in the south of the city, the pipes are buried in the ground as underground channels to guide the water. It is estimated that it can be about five miles, and the spring is still warm. However, the installation cost is quite high.</p>
<p>The system of the pool is also very different from that of Shanghai. It is divided into general pool, personal pool, and special pool. There are about 20 personal pools, which are tiled with ceramic tiles. It is wide and suitable for one person to bathe in. It is about two feet deep. Inject the hot spring to fill it, and one end is built like a pillow. When bathing, lie down in the spring, floating up and down, which is very comfortable. The spring is a natural hot spring, so the supply is not stingy. It is more comfortable than the so-called official basins and foreign basins in Shanghai. The general pool is quite large, and many people bathe together. The cost is very cheap. Each person only needs more than ten copper coins. Therefore, many people in the middle and lower classes bathe here.</p>
<p>The most beautiful bathhouse is Letian Spring in Wangzhuang. The special pool is especially elegant. Gentry, businessmen, and figures in institutions all bathe here. There are also barber shops and restaurants. Therefore, welcoming guests from afar and secret negotiations for litigation and mediation are often held in the bathhouse. As for lying on a couch in the hot summer, not knowing dusk, and using the bathhouse as a place to cool off, it is even more common. There is also a Naval United Club in Wangzhuang, which is specially set up for military and political figures. Chairman Yang Shuzhuang and naval figure Chen Jiliang often host guests and celebrate here.</p>
<p>Last summer, a certain family in Tangmen set up a female bathhouse. All the staff were female maids. The content is not known in detail. However, major bathhouses such as Letianquan have also added female seats as a result. A part of the bathroom is marked with a female bathroom, and we cannot cross the forbidden area.</p>

<p>Pierre Blouke, a famous American architect, has recently invented a glass house. Trees, benches, chairs, tables, everything is available, and all are made of glass. This house can be disassembled and carried like a car. According to Mr. White, this glass house will be popular in the world in less than three years. The house moves with people, and home is everywhere. The suffering of relocation can be greatly reduced. The house is entirely made of glass. The inside and outside of the walls are made of thick glass, leaving a vacuum in the middle, so that cold and heat cannot invade. Those who live indoors always feel warm and have the joy of warmth and harmony, without the suffering of severe winter and severe summer. All the equipment is attached to the house. All the needs of daily life, food and drink are fully available. There are also two ready-made typewriters to replace the labor of holding a pen.

<p>This national arena was probably built in the second century or the beginning of the third century. Many ancient books have already mentioned it. But it was not accidentally discovered until 1870, and was not fully excavated until 1883. We can imagine that this is a symbol of Roman civilization just by looking at these smooth stone blocks inlaid row by row with solid cement. Because the Gaul people living in Paris at that time only had wooden buildings. The architectural design of this arena is very complete. The stone steps can seat 16,000 spectators. There are devices for guiding rainwater in the arena, and devices for holding wild animals, etc. The design is so thoughtful that even the minds of the 20th century cannot match it. At that time, the performances held on this open-air stage included gladiatorial combat and hunting, animal shows and various small tricks popular on the streets, and simple popular dramas. When we walk into this arena, we can imagine the residents of Lutece sitting in rows on these stone steps during festivals, applauding and cheering for the swordsmen or actors of the time. Although the street outside twenty steps away is thundering like thunder with trams and cars, we can sit on the stone seats of this ancient theater and dream for a thousand years. Living in modern life and yearning for the culture of the past. I am afraid that only the residents of Paris can easily get this kind of leisure.</p>
<p>Now, part of the upper flat ground of this ancient arena has been converted into a small park. The arrangement is appropriate, which can reduce the desolate taste common to ancient sites. The outside of the small garden is surrounded by five- or six-story residential buildings. This makes it feel like the modern society and the remains of past life are blended together. Ordinary people don't pay much attention to these places. So it is very difficult to truly understand Paris.</p>
<p>Its convenience is really beyond imagination. Mr. Harvey Wiley Corbett, the current chairman of the Chicago Board of Agriculture, has asked Mr. Bai to manufacture a glass house for him to give to his wife. It will probably be completed next year. Mr. Bai told people that in less than ten years, people all over the world will use this glass house. Therefore, large-scale housing manufacturing plants will be established in various central locations in the United States in the future, specializing in manufacturing various glass residences. After they are manufactured, they will be transported to various places for sale, just like today's cars.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Snippets from Newspaper Reading Chicken Crown <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Newspapers are a daily necessity. Since residing in the capital, I can only receive the Shen and Xin newspapers from Shanghai in the afternoon after 5:00 PM at the earliest. As for local newspapers, because the land area is vast and delivery takes time, they usually arrive around 11:00 AM. If living in Xiaguan, it will be slightly later. Compared with the residents of Shanghai's northern and southern cities, who can hold newspapers and browse them every morning, I cannot help but feel regretful. Shanghai's tabloids are emerging like a rising tide, but in the capital, the situation is very different. Apart from one or two types, I have not been able to see the rest. On the Beijing-Shanghai trains, tabloids are sold in sets, priced particularly high, and they refuse to separate them. Guests coming from Shanghai usually do not mind the price, using them to dispel boredom. However, when the train arrives in Xiaguan, they often discard them to avoid inspection by the station staff, who will confiscate them if seen. These left-over tabloids are collected and sorted by the train vendors and can still be resold for a second time. It cannot be said that this is not a good business.</p>
<p>In the capital, subscribing to various newspapers from Shanghai from newspaper vendors generally costs one gold yuan per month. There is also a flexible arrangement, that is, the newspaper is delivered on the day and returned by the vendor the next day. In this way, the cost can be reduced to half the price. Also, at the end of the month, all the old newspapers are bundled up. If there are no missing issues, the newspaper price can also be discounted. This is because the waste newspapers are sold by the vendors, and the result is still profitable.</p>
<p>My neighbor has a Miss Lu, who works as a staff member in a certain department. According to her, in addition to copying, she is also busy cutting newspapers every day. Various daily newspapers are prepared on her desk. She first reads them carefully, selects important and relevant news, cuts them out piece by piece, and pastes them on white paper, presenting them to her superiors every day for reference. This is probably because the superiors are too busy with official duties and have no time to read everything, so they have to go through the procedure of a female staff member. But the selection process takes a lot of effort, and the scissors and paste are also very similar to a reporter's life.</p>
<p>▲Acknowledgement and Introduction: Maceol Dental Clinic has hundreds of bottles of French tooth washing liquid. Each bottle was originally worth three taels and two cents of Chinese currency and can wash teeth fifty times. Each time, the cleaning fee is three yuan. Now, due to important matters, he is returning to his country, so he is selling at a loss. Each yuan can get two bottles. Add one yuan for postage outside of Shanghai. The Shanghai Sima Road No. 512 newspaper office, Sanma Road Guangxi Road west end, and Minsheng Hospital all have consignment sales. I received two bottles yesterday, so I would like to express my gratitude and introduce them.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: Ways to Preserve Youth, Green Eyebrows Mixed with Moth Brows, No Way to Extend Life, Golden Market for Fine Bones</p>
<p>So the old A-Xiu and others told Hua Yuanchun, and said, Sixth Miss, don't get angry. Your luck has not been good these past two years. Half of it is because Shanghai's expenses are too high. Calculating, your business is not too bad, but you can't accumulate money. Every season, you are in deficit. Hua Yuanchun knew that old A-Xiu was here to nag again. She had heard these words more than once. But since she had borrowed their money, there was no way. She had to endure their nagging and also say nice things to them. So she said, Aunt A-Xiu, I understand without you saying it. You have always taken care of me. But don't I, Lao Liu, have a good day? These few dollars of yours, I can't get it out this season. Next season, I will definitely find a way. To be honest, we ladies rely on our bodies. Selling our bodies to pay off debts will not leave you short of a penny. This time, Master Zhang wanted to marry me. He asked me, Lao Liu, how much debt do you owe? I said I owed seven thousand. But I didn't really owe seven thousand. You know that. Because Master Zhang is already over fifty and has three concubines at home, I don't want to marry him. But if I really wanted to marry him, seven thousand wouldn't be a big deal. Don't worry. A-Xiu said, What do I have to worry about? But if a person stays in one place for too long, they will get tired of it. I heard that business in Beijing is very good now. There are many people from the south who go to Beijing to become officials. There are also a group of congressmen. I heard that people from all provinces are there. They are preparing to bring some money to Beijing to spend. Seventh Miss went hunting once and is said to be waiting for several thousand dollars. Plus, she bought a lot of fur coats. One game can draw two or three thousand. They don't rely on calling bureaus to drink, but on these officials gambling. Now, A-Jin, the big-bellied man from Qingyutang, has come to Shanghai to pick up ladies. He asked me if there are any beautiful and outstanding ladies that I can introduce to him. First, the face must be pretty. Second, the person must be lively and good at socializing. Those rigid ladies who look like they "owe you rice and are paying you back with Xian rice" when they see guests are not popular in Beijing. Like you, Sixth Miss, your face is good and your skills are good. When you are happy to socialize with guests, you are really outstanding. If you go to Beijing, I think you will be a first-class girl. Take advantage of your youth and make some money. Sixth Miss, if you are interested, now that big-bellied A-Jin is still picking up ladies, let's contact him first. If A-Jin hears that you, Sixth Miss, are willing to go, I think it will definitely be successful. If it is successful, you can pay me back two-thirds or half of our silver dollars first. The rest, I will consider it a share. You don't have to stay in Beijing for too long. When you have enough money, be clear-headed and find a good person to marry in the south.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Gold Standard Fluctuates Slightly <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>▲Trend Without a Clear Target. Yesterday, February 6th, the gold standard showed a reversal of its multi-day rise, with extreme chaos and rapid changes. There were sharp ups and downs with no clear direction. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets was more than fifteen taels. In the end, there was a slight decline. The morning market saw mixed buying and selling by various firms. Zhifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongyuansheng, and others were buying, while Yuanxing, Yongyuanheng, Fuchang, and others were selling. As for the overseas silver market, the trend seemed slightly different. British silver rose, while American silver fell. Therefore, the gold price opened slightly lower. Later, due to tight foreign exchange, the listed price did not change at first, but then it was reduced by half a level. The domestic market was still strong, especially with strong buying from the industry, and it quickly exceeded the 70 tael mark, reappearing the new record of 771.5 taels. However, due to the active exchange of bills by sellers, the exchange rate turned flat, so the afternoon market plummeted by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking the 60 tael mark. The initial trend in the afternoon market was upward, but then it suddenly plunged by ten taels. The storm was raging, and it was quite complicated. The hearts of the people were chaotic. Finally, within 60 taels, the inflows and outflows of various firms were diverse. It is said that the major firms may see a slight decrease this morning.</p>
<p>▲New Records Seen. From the early morning opening price of 762.5 taels for March, it immediately fell by 2.5 taels, with the major firms returning 16/3, and the forward 1/8, the silver price fell by 1/8. Private telegrams went down 1875. After that, it fluctuated around three or four taels, from 65.5 taels to 1 tael, until 9:15, when it frequently rose to the sky, rising as much as eight taels, which was because banks were doing forward British gold at 12.5, and then only 4375. First, the price was announced at 69 taels and 5 qian. The listed price did not change, and then it fell to 7 taels and 5 qian. Not long after, it rose sharply, breaking through 70 taels. Then HSBC suddenly changed the listed price by a small 125 US dollars and 25 US cents, and the Japanese gold added 1.5 fen. Moreover, the buyers in the market were still diligent, reaching 71 taels and 5 qian at more than 9:50. Then, sellers from the hedging and others sold out, and the internal British gold was flat. Maihang bought April at 4375, so it plummeted by nine taels, reaching 62.5 taels at 10:05. Later, Tongtaichang bought in, reaching 68 taels at 10:30. Afterwards, the sellers were active, and the British gold trend loosened, plummeting by nine taels, reaching 59 taels at 10:50. At more than 11:10, it increased to 64.5 taels, and then the market slumped again, plummeting by more than eight taels, reaching 56 taels at 11:50. The market situation was unimaginable. The afternoon closed at 58 taels. The announced price was initially calculated at 819 taels, with a discount of about 50 taels. Later, it was changed to 826 taels and 2 qian, with a discount of 54 taels to 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲Sudden Plunge. The afternoon market opened at 59.5 taels, but the goods had already been done big. After that, it rose and fell by one or two taels. Then, the British gold turned stable. HSBC issued May at 12.5. Then Sumitomo and Huabi bought April at 12.5. There were many buyers on the table. Wanxingshunli, Yuanmaoyong, and others bought in one after another, and the price soared by ten taels, reaching 69 taels at 3:00. Later, the wind suddenly turned down, plunging by seven taels, reaching 61.5 taels at 3:30. Then there were ups and downs of four taels. It was about five and a half taels to one tael at around 4:00. Then the Guangbang slightly entered, and it rose by three taels, totaling 64 taels. However, the market sentiment was shaky and uncertain, and it fell by four or five taels in just a few minutes. At 4:30, the market closed at 59.5 taels, a drop of 5.5 taels compared to the day before. Later, it was suppressed by a small one tael. The highest price of the whole day was 71.5 taels, and the lowest price was 56 taels, with a fluctuation of 15.5 taels. Looking back, the goods were 63.5 taels in the morning market, 58.5 taels at the afternoon close, 61 taels in the afternoon, and 58 taels at the close. The announced price was calculated at a discount of 66 or 67 taels to 57 or 58 taels, and then 66 or 67 taels were posted on the account. In the morning, 53 taels to 58 taels, and in the afternoon, 59 taels to 64 taels, the water supplement was 53 taels, and in the afternoon, 59 taels.</p>
<p>▲Trading Was Still Chaotic. Transactions by various banks included Zhifeng, Yong Yuancheng, Yuan Maoyong, Dadecheng, and Tong Taichang all buying in. Xinxheng had slight changes. Yuanxingyong, Hengyu, Bingxing, Yuantai, Yongfeng, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others were all selling out. Shunli, Wanxing, and the hedging of goods were sometimes buying in and sometimes selling out. In the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong, Yuantai, Shengda, Wanxing, and Shunli all bought in. Zhaokang, Changshengyong, Bingxing, and retail investors were selling out. Dalianbang bought a total of 1450 units in the morning market and sold more than 1000 units. In the afternoon market, they bought a total of more than 1200 units and sold more than 500 units. Guangbang bought in a small amount.</p>

<p>▲Listed Price Shrinks, Domestic Market Increases</p>
<p>▲Chinese Business Gold Industry Sells More</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, Indian, and silver markets all rebounded slightly, but American silver fell, which was the opposite of the day before. The British and American exchange rates have all fallen again. The Yokohama and Kobe markets have not risen or fallen. The foreign exchange market was hard first and then soft. The Shanghai foreign exchange market showed a slightly different trend. HSBC's listed price did not change at the beginning of the morning. At about 9:45, it suddenly changed and narrowed by one bridge. The British gold was reduced by 125, and the current price is 1 shilling 2 pence 25. The US dollar was reduced by 25 cents, for a total of 28 yuan and 875 cents. The French franc was reduced by 7 yuan, for a total of 735 yuan.

The Hong Kong dollar did not change and remained at 78 taels. The Japanese gold was increased by 1.5 fen, for a total of 1 tael 7 qian and 1.5 fen. The domestic market seemed loose in the morning, but then tightened and slumped again. Because the gold market had huge fluctuations, a new era of 771.5 taels appeared, and it broke through the 60 tael mark. Therefore, the result of the foreign exchange market in the afternoon was compared to the day before. The British gold increased by 0.0625, the US dollar increased by 0.125, and the Japanese gold decreased by 0.125. It is true that the Ming shrinks and the dark is wide. Among Chinese merchants in the gold industry, sales were generally higher. A total of 400,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Banks such as Huabi, Shanghai, Mai Jiali, Sumitomo, and Mitsui all absorbed. In addition, Hengxing and others settled with Mai Jiali, Huabi, and HSBC. More than 100,000 pounds were traded between each bank, and more than 100,000 yuan of US dollars were also traded. Only a small number of Japanese gold transactions were made.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Foreign Small Coins Remain Sluggish <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲Market Overview. Because the Shantou and Xiamen gangs slightly improved the appetite the day before, the foreign coin market suddenly appeared smart. Yesterday, the sales stagnated and the market price continued to fall. The hearts of the people were soft again, and the transactions were few. No one competed. There was no struggle for both buyers and sellers. The silver roots have been loose for a long time and have become rampant. It is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>▲Small Money Price. (Foreign Small Coins) The early market was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li and a half, and the afternoon market was the same price. The amount of exchange bills made was 820,000 in the early market and 695,000 in the afternoon market. Only 5,000 banknotes were issued in the afternoon market. As for banknotes outside the market, there was no news at all in the two markets. Banks traded 500,000 with each other in the early market and 650,000 in the afternoon market. Small money shops traded 560,000. (Silver Exchange) Both the early and afternoon markets were white loans again, and the head of the exchange was also white. The bank's listed prices were no longer market prices.</p>
<p>▲Silver Ocean In and Out. (Silver Money) Yesterday, the banks received and sent out a total of more than 2.7 million in tickets from Chinese merchants, more than 1.67 million from foreign merchants, and more than 3 million in settlement money.

<h3 id="e174">Remarkable Changes in Silver and Copper Currencies <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲ The price of "Guangjiao" rose by over three "li," while copper coins depreciated by 14,000 units</p>
<p>▲ Both Hit New Records Unseen Since the Beginning of the Year</p>
<p>Recently, due to the persistence of commercial customs at the end of the lunar year, which cannot be abruptly changed, especially in the auxiliary currency market, following old practices has led to considerable disruptions. The price of "Guangjiao" exceeding "Jiangjiao" was once rare, but now it is commonplace, with a significant difference of up to nine "li." Such a market condition has rarely been seen in past years. Yesterday, the fierce wind and rain exacerbated the situation. The early market price for Guangdong small silver coins was 6 "qian" 8 "fen" 1 "li" 3 "hao" 7 "hu" and a half, while the midday price was 6 "qian" 8 "fen" 3 "li," a further increase of 3 "li" and 2 "hao" compared to the previous day, having already risen by 1 "fen" and 3-4 "li" during the week. The transaction volume was 600,000 "jiao" in the morning and 110,000 "jiao" at noon. Jiangsu small silver coins remained ordinary and unchanged, with the morning price at 6 "qian" 7 "fen" 6 "li" and the midday price at 6 "qian" 7 "fen" 4 "li." The transaction volume was 13,000 "jiao" in the morning and 4,500 "jiao" at noon. The depreciation of copper coins was turbulent, plummeting by 14,000 "wen" yesterday, reaching only 340,000 "wen," a new low not seen last year. Consequently, exchange rates shortened dramatically, with each foreign coin worth only 2,440 to 2,450 "wen." The cause of this price surge is entirely due to market habits and year-end manipulations. As for sales, they are not very smooth, and there is no news of customers leaving. However, with such market chaos, the hardship and joy are too unevenly distributed among residents and small businesses.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Continued Rise in Securities and Bond Prices by About Half a Yuan <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures market for various public bonds was slightly clearer than the previous day, with a total turnover of 6.3 million yuan. Among them, the "19 Customs," "19 Charity," "Reorganization and Demobilization," each exceeded 1 million, the "20 Cigarette" was 870,000, and the others remained clear. Spot transactions totaled 39,400 yuan, with "Reorganization and Demobilization" and "19 Customs" each exceeding 10,000 yuan. Although there were many other offerings, transactions remained low. As for the bond market trend, the market buying sentiment remained good, with demand exceeding supply, and the trend was generally up by 3-4 "jiao" to 7-8 "jiao" compared to the previous day. However, the "96" showed no change.</p>

<p>▲ The exchange again increases cash deposit 6 taels</p>
<p>The yarn market fluctuated between morning declines and afternoon gains, with an erratic trend and a dangerous situation. This was mainly due to the strong exchange rate and rising prices of American and Indian cotton, leading to a surge in the exchange market. At the same time, rumors circulated in the market that two major brokerage firms had a large number of short positions in yarn and cotton, and due to the continuous surge in prices, there was talk of them wavering. As a result, buyers believed that a good opportunity had arrived, and buying sentiment became increasingly intense. Honest traders did not dare to move lightly. However, the fluctuations were enormous, with sudden rises and falls of about one to two taels. To avoid danger, the exchange increased the cash deposit for both buyers and sellers by six taels. Currently, the yarn market remains in a sea of ​​storms.</p>

It rose slightly by 6.7 yuan. At the second and third session, the exchange increased the special cash deposit by 6 taels. Retail investors closed out, and all months fell by 2.7 yuan to 1 tael and 3 yuan. The opening of the label yarn in the afternoon was flat.

<p>▲ Special Margin Increased by 2 Taels</p>
<p>The cotton market softened in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Due to the rise in foreign cotton and the lack of easing in exchange rates, most people believed that Indian cotton prices were expensive, and buyers were keen to purchase. Sellers were scarce, and the market became increasingly tight, with a dangerous situation and an unlimited rise in prices. However, after checking, the exchange price for Indian cotton Weng Mola and standard cotton of the same type was 34 taels and 8 qian. Adding another 5 taels for shipping and taxes to Shanghai, the total cost was 39 taels and 8 qian. Therefore, speculative groups competed to go long. The future depends on foreign cotton and exchange rates.</p>

<p>▲ Recent Arrivals and Sales Both Slow</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market condition was quiet again. Guangzhou and Ningbo merchants were watching and not buying. Only Shao merchants bought more than 200 Nanjing brown rice at a price of 8 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen to 8 yuan 3 jiao 3 fen. There were no transactions for Hunan and Jiangxi rice, but there were also few arrivals recently. Vendors are mostly not transporting due to customary closing relations. Owners of various rice in the market are asking too little and plan to sell again in the red market. Therefore, although the market is quiet, prices are not easy to fall.</p>
<p>The inventory of Ke Xian rice in Shanghai is not much. As of yesterday, there were about 40,000 bags, with Jiangxi rice accounting for more than half.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Flour Market Surges with Gold Prices <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly showed a sharp rise. Although the quotation for foreign wheat fluctuated slightly, since the surge in gold prices, goods related to international markets have jumped. The nature of the flour market, due to the presence of foreign flour, is inevitably driven by it. Recently, the sellers in the foreign firms have also been silent. Although various factories have made large sales and successively taken profits, the general outside market, in view of the rise in various goods, is also actively buying futures flour. Buyers are also increasingly buying at lower future prices, especially merchants from Nanyang and Yingkou. Although factory sales continued in the middle, the market sentiment was very strong and could not suppress the arrogance of foreign firms. As a result, the prices for the current month and March rose by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, April rose by 2 fen, May rose by 2 fen 2 li and a half, June rose by 2 fen 7 li and a half, and July rose by 3 fen 7 li and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat futures also showed a firm upward trend. Merchants from various mainland regions believed that since the standard has reached this level, even if it falls again, it seems to have a limit. Therefore, buyers were very bold. Also, due to customary reasons, the market will soon close. A few shorts were very strong in covering, and several parties were focused on one place, resulting in a very good sentiment, opening high and continuing to rise, especially for distant futures. Observing the future, if there is no impact from foreign wheat, it may be even better. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 4 fen compared to the previous day, March rose by 5 fen, April rose by 6 fen, May rose by 7 fen, June rose by 9 fen, and July rose by 5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market telecommunications from the production area: Cuban spot sugar unchanged, New York sugar futures rose by 1 point in September and 2 points in December, with no other changes. Java spot and futures sugar still lack ups and downs. The guild market has quiet trading. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sand is quoted at 10 taels 8 qian, with few inquiries. Hong Kong goods are priced at 10 taels 6 qian, with a few transactions and a shortage of sellers, so the market is quite firm. The medium white sand market is still quiet, and Japanese sugar transactions are also sparse. The market has risen slightly, with Z mark priced at 10 taels 8 qian and a half, Minghua YT mark at 10 taels 7 qian, TRO mark at 10 taels 3 qian, and YP mark at 10 taels 9 qian. There are slight transactions, and the market is still good. The number plate transactions are also few. However, due to the eager sale relationship of the number party of domestic new Qing sugar, the price has turned favorable again, continuing to open more than 2,000 packages, with the price of high-quality goods at 7 taels and a half and 7 taels and 6 qian. The market is still firm and elegant.</p>

<p>Recently, the Milan market has seen sluggish sales of Italian silk to Europe and the United States. Dry cocoon factories have slowed down their purchases, and cocoon prices have fallen by 5-6 lire. Spring cocoons are only opening at 107 lire per kilogram, summer cocoons at 93 lire, and autumn cocoons at 82 lire.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market continued to quiet down. British and French firms are mostly watching due to the recent gradual decline in shillings and the unpredictable changes in the exchange market. Yesterday, only Tongfu, Jinlong, Yongxing, and other firms bought Zhenmei and Xiami green tea, totaling more than 420 boxes. The market has fallen by 2-3 taels. There were no transactions for Hee green tea and Qimen black tea.</p>

<p>Because the gold market is still high, the pricing of piece goods is still far apart. Tianjin goods are still being searched for and purchased. A large batch has already been transported, and another 400 pieces will be shipped today. Zhigong flannel has continued to show new high prices. Sanyou pattern is sold at 3 qian 3 fen 2 li and a half, Zhu Tiger is 3 qian 7 li and a half, and Shuangtonglu is 3 qian 4 fen and a half. Industry insiders are offering higher prices. Fine Biliji Huanle opens at 3 qian 4 fen and a half. In the afternoon, Huxinting sold at 3 qian and a half for 3 qian 5 fen and a half. The first Zhigong satin was sold out at 3 qian 4 fen 7 li and a half. In the afternoon, the industry insiders opened at 3 qian 6 fen. The tightness of the market is rare. However, the street has no action due to preparations for closing. The sale of bleached cloth from Tianjin is also smooth. Fushou Samsung is 11 taels 9 qian and a half, Xianting Chuidi is 11 taels 6 qian and a half, Helu is 9 taels 9 qian, and Huawu is 8 taels 4 qian and a half, which is up 1 qian to 2 qian compared to the previous day. Among all goods, only the printed Zhigong flannel is stable. Wolonggang Shise returned to 3 qian 8 fen and a half. Tu Da Hong and Tu Meigui need 4 qian. The Changjiang gang and this street have added purchases, and the Northern gang has a lighter demand.</p>

<p>Due to the end of the year, the hardware trade is very quiet. Except for fancy goods, there are few mainstream goods on the market. However, investigations show that inventories are low. Therefore, a group of colleagues has purchased regular futures, so the number of hardware orders was active yesterday. It is said that large quantities of French nails, new copper wire, tinplate, flat white iron, and triangle iron have been placed, but there is little change in market prices.</p>

<p>Recently, the business of Kaiping No. 1 and 2 coal dust has been quite prosperous at the company's door, but sellers only supply general retail customers. It is difficult to meet the demand for those who want to buy dozens of tons on the spot. The market generally refuses to sell to colleagues and foreign merchants who want to buy. The selling price remains the same. The reason is said to be that the company's transportation contract with the boatmen has not yet been signed, and the arrival of goods is far away, while the local inventory is very scarce.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Recent Italian Literary Circles, Saviotti, and the "Return to Tradition" Movement by Wang Tiran <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Italy has always been a country with the most literary schools and "isms." Some new "isms" in modern literature almost all originated in Italy. However, they arise quickly and disappear quickly. Therefore, the ebb and flow of Italian literary trends is truly a spectacle of unpredictable change. In recent years, because the new trends have been numerous and chaotic, everyone has felt a lack of interest in "new" things. As a result, a reaction has gradually arisen. This reaction is a "return to tradition" movement, a "new" trend that rejects new things and demands old rules and traditions. In modern literature, this trend is, of course, "new," even though it returns to the old and traditional. In the recent manifestations of Western literature, this trend can be clearly seen and has a somewhat universal nature. In America, it is the so-called "Humanism," which opposes science and all new ideas, and calls for a return to the classics and tradition. In England, it is the novelists' "return to tradition" school of novelists, such as Hugh Walpole and J.B. Priestley, who are continuing the tradition of the English novel, inheriting the spirit of the Victorian era in technique and rules, and inheriting the techniques of Dickens in subject matter and content. The most popular works that dominate the English literary scene today are those of this school. In addition, in Italy, there is the aforementioned "return to tradition" movement. This movement has already become increasingly powerful in the current Italian literary scene, with a tendency to dominate everything. In the field of novels, it has promoted a tendency to return to "classicism." In the field of criticism, it has established the center of emerging Italian criticism. Therefore, it can be predicted that this "return to tradition" movement, which contains reactionary overtones and demands rules and harmony, will change the landscape of modern Italian literature. Moreover, from the perspective of the times, this reaction is also an inevitable phenomenon. After the European War, Italy, thanks to Mussolini's administration, actually achieved a temporary state of well-being from a state of instability and exhaustion. The lives of some of the people have, of course, become more stable from being unstable. This kind of stable situation produces a psychology of indulging in comfort and being conservative. As a result, some people reject the new pursuits and new efforts of freely creating by abandoning tradition and breaking away from rules in all social activities, even literature and art, and demand facilities or activities that return to tradition, abide by rules, and are based on convention and conservatism. Therefore, in literary expression, new things are created independently by breaking away from tradition. The weakness of the foundation and the emptiness of the substance could previously cater to the psychology of most people who were wandering, groping, and seeking new paths, but now they can no longer cater to the psychology of most people who dislike change and crave stability. This kind of mood, expressed in literature and art, is the recent reaction in the Italian critical scene that can be called a return to tradition movement.</p>
<p>The center of this movement is the emerging Italian critic Gino Saviotti. Saviotti is a newly emerging general star in the current Italian literary scene. According to current speculation, this star will inevitably have a great relationship with the future fate of Italian literature.</p>
<p>Saviotti is a writer from Genoa. Genoa has never been known for literature and art, but since Saviotti, it is quite possible that it will become the center of Italian literature and art. Milan, Florence, and Rome may not be able to compare with it. The situation is as follows: Last spring, Saviotti founded his organ magazine "Indice" in Genoa. After the magazine was published, Genoa gradually became a new center of attention in the literary and art world. Now, Saviotti's influence has spread throughout Italy and is gradually increasing in importance.</p>
<p>Saviotti was originally a writer with some fame. His articles are often published in some famous Italian magazines or reviews. However, more than a year ago, he felt that the state of the Italian literary and art world was too bad and that something must be wrong. So he carefully investigated and studied it. As a result, his conclusion was that Italian national literature was infected with the disease of grayness of thought. Therefore, he came to prescribe the right medicine. He first wrote down his feelings about this matter and printed them into a fourteen-page booklet entitled "An Overview of Contemporary Literature, Art, and Criticism." This declaration and the articles he published in the first few issues of "Indice" were like his outline of doctrine. His declaration begins like this:</p>
<p>The most common characteristic of contemporary art is "Cerebralismo." This is often the case in those times that are poor in imagination and rich in thought. Painters, sculptors, poets, and novelists, because they are often in contact with foreign literature and art, are more aware of the requirements of art than before. They are wandering between the new and the old. They cling to every breeze, as long as it carries the hope of clearing the air, for fear of being too late. Therefore, they are too indifferent to practice. They do not paint, sculpt, or write, but only use colors, stone, words, etc. to create some theories (but to put it more precisely, only some arguments). They are only seeking everything new and original, but they have forgotten that true originality lies in the production of true art.</p>
<p>This conceptualism and love of novelty are the characteristics of all decadent periods... We can see the signs of this situation: formal skills dominate content, just as gorgeous clothes cover the ugliness of a tuberculous body. There are people, but no humanity; there is only a brain, but no heart.</p>
<p>This passage can be said to be Saviotti's main text. Below, he will do his best to elaborate on this meaning. But we must know that he is not a pessimist. He does not think that Italian literature is incurable. He believes that the reform of Italian literature is not only indispensable, but also imminent.</p>
<p>In addition to praising the inevitability of the reform of Italian literature, Saviotti then made a thorough analysis of Italian literature in the past and present, and extended his theory to the theater, painting, sculpture, and poetry. In addition, he also criticized the critics. At the end, his declared proposition is "return to tradition," but it is neither neo-classicism, nor neo-romanticism, nor neo-verisimilitude. His proposition is to have writers continue the tradition of Italian literature, and to learn from classical writers such as Homer, Virgil, and Dante; romantic writers such as Manzoni and Leopordi; and Goldoni and Vergo.</p>
<p>But, in the final analysis, what does this proposition of his mean? His meaning is to return art to art, to make art return to the eternal source of literary and artistic creation. In short, it is that he reaffirms that simple great truth: to produce art, there must be artists.</p>
<p>Saviotti is dissatisfied with the critics of his time. He believes that they are unable to practice their work of examining works of art and guiding young writers. They pay too much attention to writing a "good article" (for future inclusion in the complete works). Their criticism is too impressionistic.</p>
<p>The above is the main point of Saviotti's entire proposition. His publication is run according to these points. Saviotti himself is the editor and critic of this publication. He has clear thoughts and speaks powerfully. In some respects, he has a kind of steady insight of the common people into literary and artistic matters. Appearing in the current Italy, he cannot but become a very extraordinary figure.</p>
