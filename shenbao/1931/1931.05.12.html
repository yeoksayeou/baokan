<p>時評</p>
<h3>銀會議中之要題</h3>
<p>今日美參院外交委員波拉氏。以無線電播音世界。力讚國際銀會議之通過。謂銀價慘跌。已成極大問題。目前已有八萬萬人民。因銀價低落而驟減其購買力。必俟各政府注意此事。恢復銀之正當地位。使人民公認爲一種有相當價值之交易媒介物。而後此全世界半數人民之購買力始能恢復云云。夫所以使銀有相當地位與價值。必如畢特門氏所主張。由各國開會議定一金銀比價計劃而後可。但此項比價標準之製定。必須經過愼重考慮。非參合金銀兩方之情勢。與各國經濟狀况之變遷。通盤籌劃。得一公允折中方法。即難得全世界人之信仰。故此金銀比價計劃。料必爲將來銀會議中最重要而又爲最難决之問題。假使苟不注意於此根本要點。而徒斷斷於一枝一節。則非特紛爭不已。而銀之一物。終必不能獲得相當之地位與價植。此全世界半數人民之購買力。亦必不能恢復。而此財政破產商業墮地之情勢。永無挽救之望矣。此則甚可寒心者也。</p>

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>析、（一）陳濟棠未必肯犧牲黨的歷史、（二）對張桂軍未必能夠合作、（三）廣東民心軍心俱厭亂到極處、有此三大原因、陳濟棠諒尙不致敢叛黨國、如果陳濟棠敢叛黨國、是即天下之公敵、中央亦自有對付辦法、可請大家放心、切勿輕聽謠言、自相驚擾、總要處以鎭定、一面實行國民會議議决案、一面努力取消不平等條約、今日因國民會議開會、不能多所報告、廣東事件、諒想當無多大問題、就此完了、報告畢、即奏樂禮成散會、</p>

<p>補充點　台端云「按開灤總公司係於民國元年由開平·灤州·兩公司合組而成、」經中英兩政府批准條約、規定十年之後、可照極公平之價、由灤礦公司向開平購買全部資產、如我國根據條約收回、英方無反對之可能、贖價一層、前據京津泰晤士報言須七千萬元、現正金價昻貴、至多不過一萬萬元」等語、查開平礦局本爲唐廷樞等官商合辦、唐死張翼繼之、時值義和團之變、開平礦局、爲俄兵所佔據於是礦師胡華（美籍爲英商墨林之代表）運其侵略手段、竟未出任何代價、而取得開平礦局全部資產、此西歷一九零一年二月十九日事也、嗣於一九一二年六月初一日、與灤州礦務公司合作、聯合組織開灤礦務總局、其合同草案、（一）開平礦務公司、灤州礦務公司、爲發達營業起見、聯合組織、設一開灤礦務總局、該兩公司、均仍其舊、各照有限公司律例、自行辦理、此總局應照中國通行中外合辦礦章辦理、呈請北洋大臣奏咨立案、（二）按照本合同兩公司之股本、應各仍其舊、計開平股本一百萬鎊、灤州股本一百萬鎊、（中略）十七、自本合同簽字之日起、十年後、灤礦公司應有權可將開平公司之全產、由兩造商定公道價值購回、（末略）迨民國十五年、楊文愷長農商部時籌議收回、十六年、張景惠長實業部時、亦擬收回、結果中輟、皆因開平方面之英人、故意拖延、藉端作梗也、台端謂如我國根據條約收回、英方無反對之可能等語、正與事實反比、此實與國力上有絶大之關係、誠未可以理論斷也、至京津泰晤士報之言、則全屬英商之思想、試思英商前以無代價取得之開平礦局全產、三十年中、其攫獲以去者、不知幾千萬元、詎又以一百萬鎊之假定股本、與灤州聯合後、欲向收回、則自定其價七千萬元、而以金貴故、約須一萬萬元、公道云乎哉、公理云乎哉、苟中國之能自强也、可以無代價收回開平礦產之外、尤應追賠損害、方足以平法理、敝會對社會一般人注意台端之談話、於此點認有補充之必要、期我國人咸知究竟、台端明達、必能贊表同情、惟敝會懷疑之點、尙望不吝指釋爲感、此致、陸費伯鴻先生、上海市煤業同業公會啟、五月十日、</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<p>特載</p>
<h3>國民會議與國民敎育（一）</h3>
<p>盧紹稷</p>
<p>敎育所以培植人材、究研學術、關於政治及文化者至鉅、昔普魯士勃焉而興、日本能一躍而起、實努力、於敎育之結果、故今世國家之强弱、恒視其國民敎育之普及與否而定、我國今日人民已受敎育者、僅有十分之三而已、敎育如此不普及、何能促成憲政乎、又何能求國際地位之平等乎</p>
<p>今在首都舉行之國民會議、其最重大之使命、除使全國國民在法律上鄭重接受中國國民黨主義與政綱、以謀中國之統一與建設外、更須於三民主義之訓政範圍内、以確立黨與人民共同遵守之約法、而樹立國家長治久安之宏規、余一方覺國民敎育之重要同時又覺國民會議係爲全民族謀幸福者、故特提出管見、以供與會諸公討論約法「國民敎育」章時之參考、</p>
<p>（一）普及義務敎育近世文明各國、凡屬國民一達學齡、即須肄業於小學、認爲人人當盡之義務、其年限各國不同、大抵以國民之經濟能力爲標準、中國現時雖定爲四年、但考國民受義務敎育者、僅有十分之三、已如前述、故吾人應宜恪守政綱、「勵行敎育普及、以全力發展兒童本位之敎育……」（對内政策第十三條）而謀「本固邦寗」之道、其辦法、可以一省爲單位（第一步）分劃全省學區、調查學齡兒童數、（第二步）斟酌地方需要、而訓練師資、（第三步）廣設學校增添學級、（第四步）酌量國民經濟及敎育需要、而籌劃經費、（第五步）由敎育部規定義務敎育法令實行敎育普及、以上僅就初等敎育而言、至中等與高等敎育、亦應謀普及、</p>
<p>（二）厲行民衆敎育考吾國未受敎育之人、泰半是鄉農·傭工·小販·銅匠·鐵匠·木匠·泥水匠·　匠·成衣匠·學徒·女工·女僕·茶房·廚房·船役·挑夫·車夫·清道夫······等、孫中山先生嘗謂「以無智之民建國、猶築塔於沙礫之上、其基不固故吾人今日除對學齡兒童設法「普及義務敎育」外、對於失學之青年與成人、更須設法、「厲行民衆敎育、」其辦法、可以一縣爲單位、每縣敎育局特設「民衆敎育委員會、」主持其事、（三）提高婦女敎育現今我國婦女、敎育程度尙低不能與男子同立於一條水平線上、吾人如果欲使、「婦女在法律上、政治上、經濟上、敎育上、及社會上一切地位、與男子有同等權利」（國民黨、最近政　）則宜提倡女敎育、一·在小學中對於貧苦之女學生、應給予補助金、二·自小學至大學一律開放、男女同學、惟管理須嚴、三·除一切男子學校開放外、並應設各級女子學校、如女子中學、女子大學、使不能考入男校者、亦有受中等或高等敎育之機會、</p>
<p>（四）奬助清寒學生近有人統計、國人受中等敎育者不及全民千分之一、受高等敎育者不及萬分之一、考其所以然者、類由中產以下子弟、困於家計、無力上進之故、在此青天白日旗幟之下、不許中等與高等敎育成爲富家子弟之專利品、須使全國青年俱有享受之機會、中山先生云、「凡在自治區域之少年男女、皆有受敎育之權利、學費、書籍、及學童之衣食、當由公家供給、學校之等級、由幼稚園、而小學、而中學、當陸績按級而登、以至大學而後已」（建國方略、地方自治開始實行法、）故今日學校應宜奬助清寒學生、初小以不收學費、膳費、與書籍費爲原則、自高小以迄大學設免費額、中等學校以上更可設修學貸資或敎育貸金、令學生畢業後歸還、（五）聯合世界敎育·中山先遺囑中云、「余致力國民革命凡四十年、其目的在求中國之自由平等……必須喚起民衆、及聯合世界上以平等待我之民族、共同奮鬥……」、吾人欲達到「中國自由平等」之地位、旣非「聯合世界上以平等待我之民族」不可、亦非聯合世界各國敎育機關及敎育專家、使其對於我國所施三民主義之敎育、表示同情不可、因不得其同情、則不能將三民主義傳佈於全世界而實現世界大同也、我國今日、（一）、應與各國敎育機關及敎育專家互換敎育書報及論文、以便傳播三民主義之目的與辦法於全球、（二）互換敎師及津貼留學生、（三）以學校敎科、傳佈各國正確之國情與理想、（四）倡設國際敎育學院、以便聯絡世界敎育、（五）指定一世界親善會、專事國際間之友好事宜以期三民主義敎育之普及、與世界大同主張之實現、要聞</p>

<h3>兩箇努力的女子</h3>
<p>— 李胥梵</p>
<p>舊雨孫君蘭蓀。自北平乘寗紹輪返滬。一昨訪余。寒暄畢。見告舟中所遇二女。情形殊慘。令人聞而憫佩。茲就所言。錄告讀者。</p>
<p>所遇舟中女子二人。江都產。一姓甘。年約而立之譜。羅敷也。夫尙在仙女鎭業餳販。一楊氏。稍幼。已寡。二人爲結義姊妹。原擅紙翦鞋花之技。即昔日所常見賣花様之流也。近年長江東流諸地。女子俱天足。時尙革履球鞋。除拖鞋及少數女子鞋頭猶綉花剌葉外。餘則顧問者寥寥。若輩受潮流之影響。不足以資餬口。迺改變方針。努力他鄕。游藝於北洋一帶。詎風氣所播。一日千里。又與南方同。致翦花之術。大受打擊。二人遂計議出國。誓抱大無畏之精神。於前歲曾作途之旅行。憑兩把利翦。四隻妙手。沿途僕僕風塵。輾轉喚售花様。竟達俄國莫斯科爲終點。所幸天之造物生人。消長循環。居然此棄彼取。俄國女子反以綉履炫美。而尤以歌舞家爲最。甘楊二氏。得逞巧翻花様。以片紙殘幅之修翦。克易五色繽紛之鈔幣。獲利頗厚。足資温飽。從此下居安業。樂不思蜀矣。不意利之所在。害亦隨至。俄當局以其在彼經年。空手旣分彼利。又白蝕麵包。認爲不滿。遽起嫉視之心。於今一月間。嚴下逐客令。勒令出境。押上西伯亞火車。宛若遞解回籍。頻行時復將其身懷積資共五百元。檢出没收。二女不得已在車中丐食過活。始到滿洲里交界處下車。至此又須改乘南滿車。奈腰無分文。上車後屢遭木屐兒鞭撻。停站驅下。露宿風餐。伺他車過站。再潛上火車。又經查覺被逐。如是者經九次之痛苦。方克偷度國境。歷盡艱苦。得達河北。當其在輪時。瀝訴經過。孫君察其情形非虚。激起惻隱之念。爲之提倡同舟共濟。咸解囊以助。彼且歷三小時之久。翦成各式花様纍纍。分報瓊瑤。莫不憫其所遇。在區區餬口小技。猶引起異族之嫉視。聞之者咸爲之欷歔不置。然其毅力勇敢。實亦可佩也。</p>
<h3>青鐙擁髻談</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>春寒夜雨。小院鐙昏。時與細君。養疴斗室。一病榻相依。有如維摩方丈。共　　禪。執役侍側者。惟一傭婦。婦遠來。　以歲暮雪天。流落異鄕者。憫其無歸。暫容栖止。因絮絮述其故鄕風物。語多驚奇。足破此岑寂之空氣。以慰無聊情緒。亦病中一消遣法也。</p>
<p>婦家近蕭河。其地濱江。村居數里外。有黃山。山中獸曰山狗。與常狗形同。而較修偉。齒出唇外。𪘪齴可畏。必兇惡。喜食小兒。以是山下人家。夕陽未下。即閉戶而居。平時誡兒女勿輕出。壯夫過山下。亦必結隊而行。且携紙傘。以山狗性畏此物。時或相遇。持傘向之一張。即狂奔而逸。故行人常備此作護符焉。一夕盛暑。熱不得眠。有夫婦携一女。置竹榻門外共臥。及醒而失其女。疾呼村人起。共覓至天曙。僅得其一腿於田間。蓋已果山狗腹已。又一家有女孩。苦啼不止。其母怒之。抱置門外。謂以供山狗。實恐之以止其啼也。俄而啓戶以視。則孩已杳。母痛梅而已。山狗之患。不減虎也。</p>
<p>更有一種人面獾者。亦喜食小兒。而恒取諸墳内之死兒。然又必生之而後食之。不生不食也。其法。夜就新埋之墳。破土取兒出。坐而抱諸懷以哭之。其聲嗚嗚。絶似母哭子也者。如是良久。兒即復活。然後大嚼焉。此理之不可解者也。婦曾有戚氏子三歲而殤。其父痛甚。一夕自外歸。過埋兒處。遙聞哭聲。躡足窺之。則獾也。猛進而擊之。獾遁兒活。喜極抱歸。今已長至十二齡。生死肉骨。常念獾恩不已云</p>
<h3>偵探術新語</h3>
<p>— 愛靜</p>
<p>偵探術必須藉助於各種專門學識。如理化心理行爲學等等。近今似以化學尤爲重要。法德二國。每年藉試騐管以破案者。其例甚夥。法國警界且有設部專聘化學家以從事於案情之探究者。犯罪者對於犯罪時易留之痕跡。如指紋足印。每可藉手套及套鞋以掩去眞跡。然據化學家研究。彼輩所不能除去者。厥爲塵埃。最近法國某麥粉廠發生竊案一起。有一二嫌疑犯被捕。彼等不承行竊。最後由彼輩耳内取出耳垢少許。用顯微鏡及試騐管檢查。發現耳垢粘有粉質甚多。其品質與該廠者同。又將鞋套衣褲一一檢騐。粉垢層層亦然。並藉此推出犯罪行動之步驟不誤。遂伏罪。蓋指紋等可以預防。而某種塵埃浮揚空中。無法使其不粘及身體良飾也。</p>
<p>專門偵探。對於犯罪者一髮之遺留。可探知其人之種族形貎性質。甚至其職業亦可查出。蓋無論何種職業。其環境内皆有其特具之塵埃。一經黏着髮際。加以檢騐。即易知也。</p>
<p>血迹檢查。亦甚重要。人獸之血固異。而人血又可加以類别。檢騐出事地點各處及遺下兇器上之各血跡。與被害者之血一爲比較。往往藉以破案不少。</p>
<p>用愛克司光外紫光及他種光線照相。可以得各種照片。爲普通光線所不能攝得者。而各種化學藥品。如四養化銤可以表現隱藏之指紋。第一鐵青化鉀可以使完全揩去之字跡還原。對於偵探學之貢獻。亦不在小也。</p>

<h3>印度遊記（五○）</h3>

<p>甘地爲人何如乎。面黑。身材不高。年六十餘。齒落而不補。被一粗布衫。向東晒太陽。與余談半小時。略云。在南非洲時。曾與中國人爲友。今後當致力東方文化之復興。與世界救濟。以其印度文書其名於余之簿上爲誌。余抄昔時所作甘地詩一首贈之。甘地態度。可舉朱子述其師之狀以明之。朱子稱其師。云頽然如一田夫野老。蓋中國學乾半耕半讀。故有此景象。雖然。其個人極簡單。而辦理組織亦與政府等耳。蓋有組織即不能簡單也。</p>
<p>印度現在實行首領制。各大小首領各率其民。加入甘地總首領。其平常人民。則毫無能力。無智識。視首領如神聖也。故亞拉巴出有首領報。The　Leader余在各地講演。該報常登載之。至甘地之主要學術。蓋在心理學上有大發明。彼昨用柔弱之感情。與强者抗。得羣衆之同情。英人亦語我。彼之無抵抗運動。頗難施以武力。因兵士鬥志。若有抵抗。則可以下攻擊。今打其左頰。彼與以右頰。利用婦女小兒運動。殊難加以罪。且囹圉有限。各縣不過容數百人。今遍地千萬衆。誠難盡執之。此甘地心理學之秘訣也。然良工苦矣。余念今物質雖發達。然世界最大變動。尙屬於心理學上發明家。最近如美之威而遜。中國之孫中山。皆深知羣衆社會心理者。故創新世界。俄之列寗亦然。并非全靠一部唯物史觀。實利用羣衆心理也。甘地之感動人者。常用絶食及哭泣。余觀其面頗帶愁容。蓋生活於　掌之下。以血肉與砲火戰。利用新同情心理。非易事也。嗚呼。世界人士均表同情於弱者。亦可見同情心理之力也。由歷史經騐。雄性鬥智力相殺。均失敗。自俄託爾士太發明同情無抵抗主義。至甘地乃光大而實行之。將來同情心理若進化。其可救世界乎。</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（一一）</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>他道。「寳全兄。我也想不到這時候會和你相見。包朗。你遭着了什麽事呀。」他説時他的眼光不時的在我臉上身上流轉不定。我答道。「還好。我得到了一件意外的贓物。又做了一回臨時的罪犯。」張寳全又搶着道。「這件事我委實一百萬分的抱歉。那個笨伯我少不得要敎他受些敎訓。現在請在下談。」他説完話。又忙着移椅敬烟。我就把剛才的經過。向霍桑説了一遍。霍桑聚精會神的聽我報告。他臉上的神態。越聽越見嚴重。末後他作驚訝聲道。「還有一條珠項圈麽。怪事。怪事。但你們的料想。並不近情。我即刻從高家裏來。也曾問起過這個問題。但不獨你的内姨並没有失去項圈的事。連别的女賓們也没有這様的事啊。」這一句話。不但破壞了我的理想。連張寳全也目定口呆的驚詫起來。我作懷疑聲道。「什麽。你才從高家裏來。難道你始終在高家裏。」霍桑搖頭道。「不。這裏面的内幕非常曲折。我竟遭了一件奇怪的事情。」我驚問道。「唉。怎様奇怪。」霍桑道。「十點半時。我接得施佳從我寓所裏打來的話。聲言有人打電話到我寓所裏。有一件緊要的事求救。我因便悄悄離了高家。趕到寓裏。施桂已把那打電話人的地址紀了下來。我不敢延緩。立即依址而往。那地點是大統路七○七號姓關。包朗。你可知道這地點是什麽所在。」我想了一想。答道。「那大統路本不很熱閙。七○七號似乎更在偏西。那裏一定更冷靜了。」霍桑點頭道。「是啊。你想冷靜到怎様程度。」我道。「我怎能想得出呢。霍桑怒睜着兩目説道。「那七○七號是一所殯舍。就是浙紹山莊的寄柩所在。裏面𫕨無一人。我就聯想到那「關」的姓字。分明是「鬼」字的諧聲。那人竟要我去幹鬼勾當呢。」</p>

<h3>每况愈下之厘市</h3>
<p>上週洋市受多頭方面激動、大舉脱手、銀行鑒於形勢每况愈下、不敢着手吸收、結果賣氣大盛、厘價大跌、差額相距達六厘强、不可謂市氣之激變、然照目下情形而論、今年繭汎歉收、固意中事、而茶汎已成陳迹、查其成績、殊屬衰替、故厥後之厘市實無好消息足資紀述耳、　　厘折價背馳經過（洋厘）昨日市况、洋厘價又跌半厘至六二五之譜、計早市爲七錢二分六厘半、午市爲七錢二分六釐六毫二忽半、形勢雖午市較優、而其一種　勢、依然難望勝利也、（銀拆）昨日銀拆稍形俏利、早午兩市均爲四分、較前日白借市况頗爲優越、劃頭加水亦有二三分市面、</p>

<p>證劵　公債跌風重起</p>
<p>昨日公債現貨、開出多種、惟交易仍零星、期市賣買、續極熱閙、蓋債價忽又趨疲故也、晨初一盤、市况猶佳、雖賣戶旺、而買方依然佔優勢、各債市價比上星期五時、一致稍漲、次盤漸漸下落、但趨勢尙平和、後市賣方交易、愈見活潑、在市上反佔　勢、價乃下降轉勁步步趨疲、迄收市勢猶殊疲、蓋市上傳財政方面、有所更張故也結果計一九善·二○捲多小二元數角、其他亦跌一元六七角左右、計現貨成交一萬八千元、期貨共二千三百四十萬、</p>

<p>糧食　客秈價漲二角　　北帮裝辦客元</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况鋒俏、因河下到頭减少、且有躉戶收買、價漲難買、因此本街均注意於客秈、客秈旣爲本街各戶爭辦、市面頓起變化、北洋帮又復在市搜索客元、人心更佳、江西機晚等客秈、立即跳漲二角左右、成交數亦見加增、全日計開出江西機晚二千餘包、價十一元四角四分、十一元、十元零九角半、江西機早二百餘包、價十元七角二分、南京機米五百包、價十一元一角半至十一元、均係本街辦去、北洋帮則去江西機元一百包、價十四元三角、亦比前市漲近角云、</p>
<h3>陰雨中標粉熱騰</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份均呈良好之象、以洋麥報價、雖祗坎拿大較限二三角、芝加哥則少出入、惟以前晚大雨、昨則又未放晴、氣候亦復甚寒、致一般人之意思、如爲長雨不已、實於新麥之收成、將發生影響、故開市後、各月份之市面、即見狂騰、尤以遠期各月份爲更甚、十月份最高時、竟到過二兩零九分、旋以本月份實銷不動、市氣平常、故又漸漸帶落、後步趨勢、如果天雨不止、業内外之人心、恐尙須一度狂熱也、結果本月份較前週末好一分、六月份好一分半、七月份好二分、八九月份好一分七厘半、十月份好二分云、</p>
<h3>雨量過多麥市向榮</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均見激昻之態、本月份因現存尙暢、人心尙能鎭靜、遠期各月份、因天雨甚驟、且無放晴之象、目下雖非放穫時期、但以雨量過多、不免略受損害、蓋本年之脚地、本不甚佳、如果收訊再惡、人心自易衝動、所以開盤迄收盤遠期市氣、始終堅勁、觀後步之消長、當以天時爲轉移也、結果本月份較前週漲三分、六七月份漲七分、九十月份漲六分云、</p>
<p>絲茶　歐美絲銷仍無轉機　　海外日絲市價傾廉、華絲廠銷仍無轉機、昨紐約方面雖有廠經電轉、而來價仍小、成交寥落、昨祗乾利等進滬白廠經六十包、祥記等進粗黃絲十四包、價均平疲云、</p>
<h3>長安發現蠶荒</h3>
<p>蠶均傾棄於五六兩日大前雨之中長安一帶、近年來蠶事益形發達、今歲農民所育之早蠶、雖改良種居多、宗天寒若冬、更兼晴少陰多、蠶多白殭、晚蠶亦因天寒而雨、飼育備感困難、支持至大眠後、詎五六兩日大雨連朝、旺葉中之蠶蛾、咸食潮葉、上吐黑沬、下洩黃水、幾至全部傾棄、蠶荒災象已成蠶戶損失不貲云</p>
<h3>杭垣繭行大半未租出</h3>
<p>今歲洋莊絲市、一落千丈、絲商備受虧折、對於今民届收　、咸抱覲望、杭垣拱宸橋一帶　行往歲此時早已租幣、今歲租出者祗及十之四五、現下杭屬蠶汎、因天寒　雨影響、蠶病　生、大半傾棄、蠶收難望、此後繭行益無人問訊、故繭行主繳費傾帖者寥寥云、</p>
<h3>土莊新綠茶歐銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、土莊茶廠製出之遂安湖州等路綠茶、英莊同孚協和等行、爲搶新起見、均不惜放價搜買、蓋今日大英公司輪船出口、以便裝運、惟昨市各茶廠家製出之貨不多、交易僅祇百餘箱、惟售盤提高至百餘兩、實因洋商急需裝船所致、市恐難站定云、</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶新様到滬</h3>
<p>昨日忠信昌永興隆等茶棧、已到有祁門紅茶新様、香味製法葉底均佳、一俟大堆到滬、即可正式佈様云、</p>
<p>疋頭　元洋紗慘落未巳</p>
<p>本廠布市面無甚榮辱、實銷尙暢、惟九磅布昨因現貨稀少而復漲、猫英·五福均開五兩、聚寳盆四兩八錢半、十三磅之飛熊·牛頭亦硬、昨俱開六兩二錢、温台寗波等帮各有採辦、細布已呈站定之局、藍鷄爲七兩一錢半、彩球七兩四錢二分半、陽鶴七兩四錢七分半、細斜藍雙魚仍七兩三錢半、陽鶴七兩四錢二分半、怡和條漂依然俏利、開八兩六錢、現貨尙少、粗斜紋頗形寂寞云、</p>
<p>東西疋連日市况平定、惟各貨中元洋紗跌勢頗烈、良以天時不熱、客銷無生氣、而前到者均將到期、所以逐步下落、昨點秋香已跌至十兩零二錢半、小美人十二兩零五分、一品富貴·寒山寺等牌亦紛紛下落、滬上存貨尙多、後步一時尙難轉機、白縐布跌風已息、條子府綢大有愈趨愈高之象、箭來圖售四錢零五厘、清官鏡四錢、又漲五厘、印花麻紗·印花色汀本街略有成交、價尙平定、西貨以府綢爲最俏、漲起一分左右云</p>
<h3>厚薄雨衣布互有漲跌</h3>
<p>厚「單面開水美」通來本街日有成交、然其市價以存多到接、迭見下降、昨榮、昨榮泰·好華·洪盛·正昌信記各牌、一律跌售至五兩、原箱打票出貨、尙肯挫削幾分云、「薄貨象皮裹雨衣布」市存極缺、售盤頗堅、藍色尤爲軋缺而漲、昨正昌·信記·榮泰·泰和貨統皆漲售至三兩二錢半、拆疋頭搭顏色、每碼尙要增加一錢、欲售秃藍者、非出三兩五錢淨盤難以獲得、蓋海上秃藍溥雨衣布存積、確寥寥無幾云、</p>
<p>南北貨　黑瓜子逐步特升　　黑瓜子近以各帮走銷活潑、市價逐步特升、昨市席帮號家開出工檔一批、計一百包、價爲十三兩尙有餘額、非十三兩半不肯脱手、趨勢緊俏、其次普通莊開十二兩半至十二兩、徐魁子六十二兩、比前市均升兩許、查行號手存均薄、後市尙防再緊、</p>
<p>糖市　粗砂白始跌後挺</p>

<h3>北行散紀</h3>
<p>— 安平</p>
<p>十四　燕京拾碎（上）</p>
<p>北平的大學也不算少、比較好一些的、如我們大家知道的清華大學、燕京大學、北大、以及還有一隻在當地還算有名的敎會辦的輔仁大學、</p>
<p>這幾家大學、情形爲我頂熟悉的是燕京大學、其次是清華大學、我想南方的學生做着到燕京去的夢的、其數不在少、至於清華、大家對於他知道得多一些對於燕京則不很知道得詳細、因爲自己對於這隻學校比較的熟悉、故在此也想多寫一些、</p>
<p>我先告訴你關於燕京的一切物質方面的情形、</p>
<p>講到校景這一點、我想中國的一些大學之中、當推之江大學爲最、據説全世界大學校景最好的、中國的之江算第二了、就是上海的滬江、位於黃浦江邊、自然也不算壞、可是説起Building恐怕就要推燕京爲第一了、燕京的Bussiness的好處第一是多、第二是整齊、第三是建築得考究、你一走進這校園、便覺得裏面考究得像皇宮似的、男生宿舍六座、女生宿舍八座、男膳堂兩座、女膳堂四座、辦公處一座、圖書館一座、宗敎樓一座、敎室大約有四五座、已記不清楚了、女體育館一座、男體育館一座、姊妹樓兩座、那是作爲男女生交際之用的、還有病院……等等、大約正正式式的房子、有三十座左右、房子是一列的新皇宮式、尤其是辦公處的一座、最爲宏麗、據説單這一座、建築費在五十萬元、辦公處的那一座的樓上、是大禮堂、説到大禮堂、自然不及清華大學的、但比較江南一些大學的、也就夠生色、舉告是完全合理的構造、位子很寛舒、地板光亮、一切都很好、</p>
<h3>罈上的大夏女生</h3>
<p>你到燕京、不説你不注意、一説你就覺到驚訝、就是你在燕京、是看不見一根電綫的、他們的電綫、都通在地下、一切路燈、都富於一種異國的情調、是水泥的桿、玻璃的八角式的明瓦燈、電綫都從地下接上來、原來燕京的房子、起了還不久、他們不像别的學校、事前一無計劃、一無規模、有錢想起房子的時候、便隨便在什麽空地上砌一座、他們對於一切建築·佈置·在事前都有一種完美的設計、所以他們的房子、非常整齊者、此亦原因之一、燕京的Power　House（電氣間）怕要算中國所有的大學裏的頂大的了、單房子、就足足建築了八十萬、一方面、供給全校及附近的敎員宿舍區域的電燈、一方面、還供給着全校用的熱水、與冬天房子裏用的熱水汀、</p>
<p>燕大的宿舍、每座都是兩層、每一層、有二十幾間房間、每一個房間兩個人、每一個房間裏、由學校供給的是兩張床、兩個床上用的草塹、一架櫉、衣櫉又一分爲二、各佔其一、一張桌子、一架五斗廚、給你放放零碎東西或換洗衣服、和兩張椅子、每一個房裏有兩扇窗、一架熱水汀的管子、電燈到十一點半熄火、而早上五點鐘又亮了、所以初到那裏的人、睡得早、醒得遲、那末一定會以爲電燈是終夜不熄的、</p>
<p>每一層樓都有一關洗臉間、洗臉間裏可以洗澡、也可以大小便、洗澡有盆、也有蓮蓬頭、隨你便是冷熱水龍頭、就是大便那種設備、也是考究到極點、對於這些、我不再想形容了、</p>
<p>膳堂就建築在兩座宿舍的當中、樓上是大大的一個廳眞大、也眞高、吃飯便在那兒樓下分成若干間、分爲閲報室、游藝室、學生會辦公室、以及預備學生們的朋友暫時來住一兩天的「客房」、</p>
<p>膳食是完全由學生會管的、按月包也可、另吃也可、按月包、有十元一種、有八元一種、另吃、飯每人七分、其餘菜、你自己點、點多少、給多少錢、飯分米飯、麵食、和粥三種、隨你用、菜、從每碟三四分到二角、由你點、比如、你説來一碟素炒油菜、祇消大洋三分、來一碗血絲湯、也祇三分、來一碟猪肉炒猪肝、祇消一角四分、燕京的膳食的便利、我以爲、决不在乎這種吃的自由、却是在乎廚房的服務的敏捷、我便不曾看見有那一家大學的膳廳、廚房的服務、有如燕京好過、茶房是一百分的馴伏、菜是燒得來得快、你呌</p>
<h3>傘下</h3>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>下去了、祇消一兩分鐘、便來了、不用着老等、吃了付現錢可以、吃了上帳也可以愛在第一食堂吃可以、愛在第二食堂吃也可以、早上從七點鐘一直到九點半、全有早飯吃、你起身得早、有吃、起身得遲、也有吃、吃炒麵也有、吃湯麵也有、吃粥也有、吃炒糕、炒麵頭、麵頭、煎麵頭都有、眞是便利、</p>
<p>要是更愛舒服、不在校内吃、則校外附近也有包飯館子、説起校外飯館子、更好、他們晚上是吃飯、中餐、則每天換一種東西吃、比如逢禮拜一吃麵、禮拜二吃葱油餠、禮拜三吃花絞、禮拜四吃麵頭、禮拜五吃餃子等等、非常有趣、毫不單調、</p>

<h3>中公新聞學會</h3>
<p>— 兄天</p>
<p>新聞學會是中公愛好新聞學和新聞事業的同學組織的、過去有很好的成績、如聖約翰的新聞學系敎授武道先生、民治新聞學院的校長顧執中先生、以及申報記者戈公振先生、新聞報記者郭步陶先生、都曾被該會邀請去講演過、又曾參觀申新二報館做實地見習、所有的表現、可以説是過去中公學術團體中之佼佼者、但不幸、學校風潮發生、在那滿城風雨之中、牠—新聞學會也就在那無人顧惜的景况中夭折了、這是多麽可惜的事件呵、正因爲牠的天折可惜、所以在我們腦中的印象却深刻的存在、</p>
<p>於今、新聞學會又跟着這在中興的中公復活了、</p>
<p>「親愛的同學們、</p>
<p>新聞會過去所表現的成績、</p>
<p>大約還能夠在各位腦中憶起吧、</p>
<p>現在我們的環境怎様、看吧、</p>
<p>我們有創辦民國日報的校長邵力子先生、有服務新聞界的總務長朱應鵬先生、有新聞學專家的敎授謝六逸先生、我們在這學識豐富經騐充足的指導之下、要將這枯萎了的新聞學會復活起來、要將我們的熱誠與毅力求其成長、</p>
<p>同學們、快來吧、」</p>
<p>在這様一紙熱誠號召的通告下、集着從青年心腔裏流出的誠懇和熱烈、又將牠—新聞學會—灌溉得復活了、</p>
<p>上月二十九日下午七時、在中公大禮堂百餘同學的歡迎鼓掌聲中、黃天鵬先生被請來做第一次的學術講演了、是稍留心到新聞學界的人都會知道他的、他著有很多關於新聞學的書籍、現任復旦大學新聞學系敎授、是位態度誠懇的學者、他的講題是、「新聞學人」就是新聞記者的意思、</p>
<p>接着他又很誠懇的要求同學提出問題來給他解答、做談話式的討論、於是又談到、上海各大報館的歷史和編輯方法的批判、中國造紙廠的現狀、　　因爲時間限制、他希望下次有機會再來談談、</p>
<p>聞該會已約定繼續來校講演者、有謝大逸先生、朱應鵬先生、瀋公弼先生、戈公振先生、其在接洽中者、尙有數人云</p>

<p>Draft Constitution Review Committee</p>
<h3>Additions and Deletions to the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Draft Constitution Review Committee held its second review meeting at 3:00 p.m. today on the third floor of the meeting hall. Chairman Wu Jingheng first discussed the written proposal submitted by Dai Jitao to add Articles 35, "The state shall establish and operate oil, coal, gold, iron mining industries, and shall protect and encourage privately operated mining industries," and 36 to the fourth section on National Livelihood. This was unanimously passed and added as the original text. Next, the draft articles of Chapters 5 to 8, Articles 38, which were not reviewed in the first meeting, were discussed. After the opinions of the public, the modifications are as follows: (1) Article 51, that is, Article 51 of the draft, deletes the words "the state" and adds "the details shall be determined by law" after remedial education. (2) Article 52, that is, the previous Article 50, "raise funds" is changed to "broadly raise funds" and the five characters "education fund and" are deleted, replaced by the character "its." (3) Article 53 is added: "The state shall provide subsidies and incentives for overseas Chinese education." (4) Article 54 is added: "Private schools with excellent performance shall be rewarded or subsidized by the state." (5) Article 62, that is, the previous Article 58, deletes the four characters "stipulate general rules." (6) Article 70 is added: "The state's revenue and expenditure shall be compiled into a budget and final account by the National Government and promulgated." (7) Article 74, Supplementary Provisions, Article 69, is revised to: "The heads of the various Yuan (院) and the heads of the various Ministries and Committees shall be nominated by the Chairman of the National Government and submitted to the National Government for appointment and removal according to law." (Special dispatch on the 11th) (Nanjing) Reporters visited various representatives and inquired about their opinions on adding chapters on finance and military affairs to the draft constitution. The majority believed that it was necessary to stipulate the chapter on finance at the beginning of the period of political tutelage for national construction. The chapter on military affairs was considered unnecessary because the period of military government had passed. This afternoon, the Draft Constitution Review Committee passed the addition of Article 70 to the draft after Article 65, which reads: "The state's revenue and expenditure shall be compiled into a budget and final account by the National Government and promulgated." The chapter on military affairs was unanimously rejected and not established. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hong Ludong and others plan to add the provision of "Swear to practice revolutionary doctrines" to the draft constitution. The methods are: (1) Add the following article to the supplementary provisions of the draft constitution: "All people must swear to abide by the Three Principles of the People, and all rights they should enjoy shall be protected by this draft constitution." (2) Or add the following article to the chapter on the rights and obligations of the people: "The people have the obligation to abide by the Three Principles of the People."</p>

(Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Proposal on News Industry</h3>
<p>Proposed by Zhao Yushi and others</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Yushi and others proposed: In order to promote Party doctrines, assist political tutelage, develop the people's intelligence, and enlighten culture, the government should effectively promote the news industry. The original text is as follows: The news industry has a close relationship with national culture, social education, promoting Party doctrines, and improving politics. Looking at European and American countries, newspapers are developed and almost everyone reads them. Governments also do their best to support them, using them as a means of promotion. Even in Japan, the daily sales in the country are about 11 million. Based on a population of 70 million, one in six people must read newspapers. In our country, there are no more than 200 newspapers nationwide, with a total daily circulation of less than 700,000 copies. Compared with the daily circulation of 2 million copies of the Daily Mail in the United Kingdom, it is less than half. Based on a population of 400 million, only one in more than 500 people can read newspapers. The low level of national education is undeniably true, and the government's support in this regard is even more urgently needed. In 1928, the Ministry of Transportation convened a transportation conference. Representatives from the former University Council, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Shanghai Daily Association proposed to re-stipulate the postal and telegraphic methods for the news industry. Then, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and others submitted reports to the National Government and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting that the proposal be implemented. After several months, the Ministry of Transportation first set a transitional method to open the door for gradual progress. Now, we are happy to see the opening of the People's Assembly, promoting culture, guiding the people's intelligence, and realizing political tutelage. It is even more urgent to do so. Therefore, we propose a plan, requesting the General Assembly to pass it and send it to the National Government to issue orders separately, so as to provide effective assistance and achieve the effect of creating public opinion. Whether it is appropriate, please decide publicly. 1. News telegrams should be sent as soon as they arrive. The original price was 2.5 cents per word, reduced by 0.5 cents. News urgent telegrams are charged four times the news telegraph price. (Reason) In Japan, news telegrams are charged 30 sen for every 50 characters, which is the same throughout the country. Compared with China, China uses numbers, and Japan uses letters. For example, a 38-character news telegram in China is equivalent to 152 code characters, and the price is 9.5 cents per word at 2.5 cents per word. In Japan, 152 letters only cost 6.2 cents, which is almost double. Moreover, Japan has a special agreement to pay 2,200 yuan per year, calculated at 1,500 words of news telegram per day, which is only 2 cents per word, which is the most affordable. Moreover, news telegrams originally emphasize speed. The printing time is calculated in minutes and seconds. If it is delayed, it will be in vain. National political news is especially valuable to be disseminated early to stabilize people's hearts. This is obvious without the need for wise men to understand it. Urgent telegrams are now priced as ordinary commercial telegrams, which is a great loss to the original intention of assisting the news industry and promoting the overall plan of political affairs. 2. News long-distance calls should be charged at a rate of one-fifth of the news telegram rate, and the registration and urgency fees should also be doubled according to the news telephone rate. (Reason) Telegraphs and telephones are both state-run enterprises and should be handled in the same way. 3. Standardize newspaper postage and abolish the price difference for those who have not yet established a steamship route (Reason) The current</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>Important Issues in the Silver Conference</h3>
<p>Today, US Senator Borah used a radio broadcast to the world to praise the passage of the International Silver Conference. He said that the severe decline in silver prices has become a major problem. At present, 800 million people have had their purchasing power sharply reduced due to the low silver prices. It is necessary for governments to pay attention to this matter, restore silver to its proper status, and make it recognized by the people as a transaction medium with considerable value. Only then can the purchasing power of half of the people in the world be restored. The reason for giving silver a proper status and value must be, as Pittman advocated, for countries to hold a conference to determine a gold-silver ratio plan. However, the formulation of this standard ratio must be carefully considered. If the situation of both gold and silver and the changes in the economic conditions of various countries are not taken into account, and a fair and moderate method is not comprehensively planned, it will be difficult to gain the trust of people all over the world. Therefore, this gold-silver ratio plan is expected to be the most important and most difficult issue to resolve in the future Silver Conference. If we do not pay attention to this fundamental point, but only focus on one branch or one section, then not only will there be endless disputes, but silver will not be able to obtain a proper status and value. The purchasing power of half of the people in the world will not be restored, and there will be no hope of reversing the situation of financial bankruptcy and commercial collapse. This is very alarming.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>The Postal Bureau Regulations were originally drafted by foreigners, who were kidnapped by imperialists at the time. They were not intended to benefit us in promoting culture and popularizing education. Therefore, newspaper postage was arbitrarily divided into those who have established a steamship route and those who have not. The fees for those who have not established a steamship route are ten times higher than those who have. Although the discount is now 60%, it is still 6 times higher. Moreover, there are places that only do not have a steamship route for one or two months a year, which are also included in the list of those who have not established a steamship route. This is unprecedented in the world. The areas where steamships have not yet established a route are even more areas where the people's intelligence is blocked. The country benefits from its promotion, and it should be reduced to enlighten it. Therefore, it is urgent to standardize it in order to eliminate the legacy of imperialism. 4. Exempt airmail newspaper postage. (Reason) Newspapers spread political news and value speed. The country is creating an aviation industry, and since it has already collected aviation fees, it is not necessary to collect postage again. 5. The national state-owned railways should issue first-class long-term quarter-price train tickets to each newspaper office, limited to newspaper offices that publish two large sheets of newspapers per day. (Reason) In Japan, all boats and cars have free tickets for news reporters. Now, paying a quarter is already difficult for the news industry. 6. Advertisements from various agencies should be charged according to the market price of each newspaper. (Reason) Recently, the raw materials of newspapers have been rising, making it difficult to maintain them. Various agencies have regular expenditures included in their budgets every year, and they should be charged according to the market price of each newspaper, as in the case of ordinary commercial advertisements. 7. Newspaper offices should be exempted from business tax in the future. (Reason) Newspaper offices are dedicated to promoting culture and are one of the social undertakings. Most countries do not collect book taxes, and our country has never collected them either. This principle should be followed, and newspaper offices should be exempted from business tax. 8. Except for military areas, cancel news censorship. (Reason) The Party and the country are united, and freedom of speech is valued. During this period of political tutelage, we must pay attention to propaganda and awaken the people. Therefore, except for special circumstances in military areas, news censorship should be generally canceled. 9. The Ministry of Industry should build a paper mill. Before the products are produced, the tariffs should be appropriately reduced. (Reason) There is currently no self-made newspaper paper in the country, and everything is obtained from imports. The annual leakage is more than tens of millions. Recently, the Ministry of Industry has formulated a large-scale plan to establish state-owned industries, and it should give priority to establishing a paper mill in order to recover rights and interests. Before the products are produced, the tariffs should be appropriately reduced to provide relief. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Yushi, the original proposer of the News Industry Promotion Act, told reporters that the case was co-signed by more than 100 people and has already been submitted this morning. This is a problem for the entire society, not just a part of the news industry. In our country, more than 500 people account for one newspaper reader, which is far from the same as in Eastern and Western countries. The reason for this is half that the government does not promote it, and half that the news industry does not operate well. Now that the case of rescuing small and weak industries and commerce has been reviewed and submitted to the General Assembly, the expectation of this case should be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.

<h3>Five-Year Agricultural Plan</h3>
<p>Methods Proposed by Chen Guansheng and Others</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Guansheng and others proposed a plan to establish a five-year agricultural development plan to enrich the people. The methods and full text are as follows: 1. Immigrate and Colonize Border Areas: Move people from the South and surplus troops to the Northeast and Northwest regions to implement the reclamation of official and public wasteland. The Northeast is of particular importance, as it borders strong neighbors. The Japanese have long coveted it, and the violent Russians are again eyeing it. At this critical juncture, our government should act decisively and quickly establish a Reclamation Bureau to encourage people to colonize the border areas. This would not only solve the people's livelihood but also resist strong neighbors. If we continue to abandon it, the degree of danger would be unimaginable. Furthermore, the majority of farmers in the interior have no land to cultivate and cannot even get enough to eat despite their year-round hard work. As Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Liberating farmers is the only way." The organization and methods of the Reclamation Bureau will be detailed later. 2. Land Survey and Measurement: Implement measurement and registration of land. Even in the areas north and south of the Yangtze River, there are countless abandoned lands. At a time when food is scarce, if we do not seek to increase production to solve the people's livelihood, our country will never have peace. Therefore, a national land survey should be implemented to expand the area of cultivated land and increase agricultural production, which is also a way to solve the people's livelihood. 3. Dredging Rivers: Our country's agriculture has always been developed, and the Yangtze River Basin is an excellent agricultural production area with convenient irrigation and drainage. This is critical to maintaining the people's livelihood for thousands of years. However, in recent years, floods and droughts have been frequent, and disasters have occurred repeatedly. The main reason is the siltation of rivers, which is detrimental to agricultural cultivation. The fundamental solution is for the government to survey national rivers and dredge them quickly to relieve the people's distress. 4. Establish a Farmers' Bank: Many poor farmers in our country have land but no capital, and many cultivators lack resources. They often pawn their goods and borrow money, suffering from the heavy exploitation of local bullies and gentry. The suffering of farmers is unspeakable. As a result, the return on agricultural production is too low, and farmers' livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. Abandoning farming for industry has become a common phenomenon, leading to rural decline and farmland abandonment. To remedy this, a Central Farmers' Bank should be established, with branches in provinces and counties, providing low-interest loans to farmers so that they can receive tangible benefits. 5. Develop Rural Agricultural Education: Agricultural education in our country has been implemented for a long time and has achieved considerable results. However, farmers have not benefited much because it tends to focus on advanced academic research, emphasizing theory over practical application. While such advanced education is extremely important, rural agricultural education is even more urgent. Since farmers make up the largest proportion of our country's population, agricultural education should be applied to the children of farmers. Therefore, the government should establish agricultural supplementary schools and add agricultural courses to primary schools in all counties and villages across the country as soon as possible so that all people have agricultural knowledge and strive to be self-sufficient. The organization and methods of the supplementary schools will be discussed in detail later. 6. Establish Rural Cooperatives: Rural cooperative undertakings should be supported by the government to jointly promote rural revitalization and enrich farmers' economies. This is an essential plan. It is requested that provincial and county governments immediately establish the above six items based on local conditions as prerequisites for developing our country's agriculture and practical elements for solving the people's livelihood. In this year, the Reclamation Bureau should be established first to implement immigration and colonization. After the establishment of the Reclamation Bureau, personnel should be sent to inspect the land conditions in the Northeast and Northwest, promulgate incentive regulations, and inform the public to encourage them to work hard so that people in the interior do not hesitate and move forward rapidly, happily settling down, and turning barren land into fertile soil. In 1932, implement a national land survey plan, using revolutionary construction methods, strive to proceed and complete it within a time limit, so that the area of cultivated land can be expanded and food can be abundant. By 1934, repair rivers and establish surveying bureaus, recruit engineering experts, and earnestly study water management methods. In 1934, widely establish farmers' banks and rural agricultural education, and establish rural cooperatives, etc., to complete them as much as possible within five years to seek agricultural development. It is hoped that our government will implement this as soon as possible to relieve the people's suffering.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Implement Ritual Education and Advocate Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhuang Songfu, Deputy Director of the Huai River Guidance Committee and representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Farmers' Association at the National Assembly, believes that during this period of political tutelage, the enactment of a provisional constitution to unify and construct tools must have the work of leading the public to consistently support it. For the sake of cultivating public virtue and conveying public sentiment, he specifically submitted two proposals to the Assembly: implementing ritual education and advocating public opinion. The methods are as follows: (1) Implement Ritual Education to Cultivate Public Virtue (Methods): The National Assembly shall invite domestic experts in Confucian ritual education and those familiar with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to form a Ritual Education Committee.

Each year or every three years, methods of praising, rewarding, punishing, and admonishing shall be formulated, imitating the ancient intention of honoring worthy and capable individuals, to ensure that the inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace advance without retreat. (2) Advocate Public Opinion to Convey Public Sentiment (Methods): The National Assembly shall elect several elders with mature virtue and high reputation to form a National Public Opinion Committee. Then, the Committee shall invite several people with rich knowledge and experience in politics, economics, and society, and establish communication offices in important transportation hubs in each province, to present opinions based on justice, or collect information on political phenomena and their benefits and harms, and report and propagate them as appropriate. In case of gaps and misunderstandings in various aspects, they shall be clarified and explained at any time, with the aim of achieving understanding. It is hoped that the Assembly will make a public decision on whether the right-hand proposal is feasible. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<p>He Yingqin and Others</p>
<h3>Entreating for the People of Provinces Long Beset by Bandits</h3>
<p>Hoping Chen Jingtang Will Not Become a Sinner Who Destroys Unification</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, He Chengjun, He Jian, and Lu Dipin telegraphed on the 11th: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Deputy Commander Zhang Jun, National Assembly representatives, presidents of various yuan, party headquarters at all levels, provincial and municipal governments, commanders-in-chief of various routes, army commanders, division commanders, and all newspapers nationwide: We hereby address the telegram to Commander Chen Jingtang of Guangzhou. We have recently read the telegrams from Deng Ziru and other comrades who are trapped, fabricating rumors and wantonly attacking, only seeking to vent personal grievances, regardless of shaking the foundation of the nation. The whole country is horrified and condemns it as ominous. However, Deng Gu is already a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and has attached himself to the form of a proposal for impeachment. If the Central Supervisory Committee can make appropriate corrections, we deeply hope that it will not cause political disputes. However, the advice of the five supervisors, Cai Zhang, Li Zhang, and Wu, failed to prompt Deng Gu's understanding, and you suddenly sent a telegram. It is true that Chairman Chiang was forced to leave the province due to your unusual actions, and it is also heard that you are actively preparing for military affairs, threatening the central government. The actions of Zhang, Tang, Feng, and Yan in the past were severely criticized by you for their impropriety. Now you are willing to repeat their mistakes. This is something that Yingqin and others are greatly puzzled by and must speak to you painfully. For several years, warlords who have resisted the central government have all collapsed on their own, and those who were originally revolutionary soldiers but suddenly betrayed the revolution have perished even faster. You may now try to justify yourself by criticizing the central government and not admitting that you are betraying the revolution. However, as soon as Deng Gu's telegram arrived in Nanjing, Chairman Chiang immediately requested that the central government review and deal with it. Cai, Li, and other five supervisors have also explained many points of misunderstanding. If you have the sincerity to love and protect the Party and the country, you should withdraw your previous remarks and stop all actions. As for Mr. Hu's personal affairs, if we have any opinions, we can offer suggestions to the Party as Party members. If the Party does not approve Mr. Hu's resignation, and the government or individuals take action without authorization, then the Party will not allow the gradual usurpation of individual power. If the Party wants to keep Mr. Hu in Beijing to work, individuals should not have dissenting opinions and force Mr. Hu to leave Beijing. In short, this is a matter within the Party. We Party members can only obey the Party and obey Party orders. Mr. Hu is also a Party member, and his actions must be based on the Party's public opinion. No individual or small number of people can violate Party principles and overstep their authority. Moreover, you are a soldier and should especially obey Party principles to avoid the suspicion of military interference in politics. If you insist on your own personal feelings and the prejudices of a small number of people, and insist on going your own way, regardless of damaging the Party and the country, it cannot be said that you are betraying the revolution. Although Guangdong is a region with financial resources, it is ultimately a corner of the country. How can it be an enemy to the whole country? The reason why Dr. Sun Yat-sen was able to use Guangdong as the source of the revolution was because his doctrine was organized and he himself was the greatest leader. What are you relying on now? Although you hold heavy troops and accumulate thick capital, you should consider whether you are as good as Chen Jiongming. Chen Jiongming's contributions in Guangdong were not insignificant, and his reputation was not insignificant. With a single thought error, he was ruined and became a laughingstock forever. Recalling the Northern Expedition of 1922, it drove straight into Jiangxi and could have directly attacked Youyan. However, Chen Jiongming rebelled in the rear and conspired, leading to the loss of all achievements. Chen Jiongming's crime was not only betraying Dr. Sun Yat-sen but also obstructing the righteous army. Now, the Red bandits are rampant in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Our revolutionary soldiers have devoted months of effort to suppress them and are in the process of thoroughly eliminating them. If you provoke another civil war, hindering the completion of our bandit suppression plan and giving the Red bandits a chance to prolong their existence, the weeds will be difficult to eliminate, and the country will be destroyed in no time. Your crime will be even greater than Chen Jiongming's. You may be deceived by the instigation of politicians, thinking that once Guangdong launches an uprising, all the southwestern provinces will respond. However, Deng Gu's telegram was sent ten days ago, and your telegram has also been sent for a week. Who has risen up to agree? Chairman Long of Yunnan believes that the denunciation is righteous and stern. It can be seen that justice is in people's hearts, and the world has long been tired of war. Why do you still allow yourself to be deceived by reactionary politicians and remain unaware? It is also heard that you will form an alliance with Zhang Gui in the west to serve as external support. Regardless of Zhang Gui's usual relationship with you, whether it is gratitude or hatred, and whether he can be used by you, once you turn against him and lead a wolf into the house, can you guarantee that all your subordinates will not carry two hearts? As for the reorganization faction, it is the incarnation of the Communist Party. It not only destroys the Party and the country but also caused the disaster of burning and killing in Guangdong, which the people of the whole country regard as a flood and a beast. The compatriots of Guangdong especially hate it. Now it is heard that Deng Gu is shamelessly colluding with traitors, making our revolutionary soldiers work as accomplices for tigers and publicize for bandits. The efforts of the soldiers over the years to create a revolutionary base and achieve today's unified situation will be destroyed by the Communists. Not only will Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven not be comforted, but what will the people of Guangdong and your subordinates think, and how will you be able to comfort yourself? At the beginning of the Northern Expedition, the financial resources of Guangdong Province alone were enough to supply the entire National Revolutionary Army. Now, your troops, including those of Chiang and Cai, have only a total of five divisions, but the monthly demand for military expenses is as high as 4.3 million yuan. All construction projects in Guangdong cannot be implemented and you cannot ask from them at will. It is not enough, so you take all the income from Guangxi in Wuzhou, which is also more than 500,000 yuan per month. Not only the national troops are treated exceptionally well and unrivaled, but there is no such example in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. If you are still not satisfied, can the people of Guangdong and Guangxi endure this exploitation for a long time? Can your subordinates not have the heart to plunder? If you remain unrepentant, the world will say that you first used military power to drive away Chairman Chen, the local official, and then used military force to threaten the central government and interfere in Party affairs. How can you tolerate this? Yingqin and others have always known that you can distinguish right from wrong and know the advantages and disadvantages. Whether for public or private reasons, you will not do this. If you abandon the central government today, your political life will be completely cut off. If you continue to support the central government, the glory of the revolution will last forever. Good fortune and misfortune are your own choices. At this time, the key to whether the Red bandits can be eliminated to save our people lies in you. The Red bandits have deeply harmed the country, and the cruelty of their burning and killing is unprecedented. If we allow them to spread again, we will all be wiped out. Yingqin and others are responsible for suppressing the bandits and are deeply concerned about the country. We dare to use our greatest enthusiasm to entreat for the people of the provinces that have long been beset by bandits. We offer our final advice to fulfill our duty as comrades who have shared difficulties for a long time. We hope that you will adopt our loyal words to eliminate personal prejudices, unite to suppress the Red bandits, and preserve the history of your efforts to revolutionize in recent years. Do not become a sinner who destroys peace and unification. You must know that Guangdong is China's Guangdong, not something that can be seceded by individuals. The army is the country's army, not something that can be privately owned. How can we revolutionaries in a revolutionary base destroy its revolutionary history and become a sinner of the Party and the country because of one or two people? It is not too late to turn back from the brink, and it is benevolence to lay down the knife and become a Buddha. Only good people can receive good words. We hope that you will forgive our recklessness and examine yourself.</p>

<p>Wang Zhengting Reported</p>
<h3>Legal Rights Negotiation Procedures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' weekly memorial service on the 11th, Wang Zhengting reported that diplomatic matters should have a time limit. The Regulations for the Implementation of Jurisdiction over Foreigners in China were promulgated on the 4th of this month and stipulated that they would be implemented from January 1, 1932. This is the same as the new tariff regulations, which stipulated that they would be implemented from February 1, 1929, both with a time limit. Now that the Chinese government has promulgated the Regulations for the Jurisdiction over Foreigners, it will not hesitate to make significant sacrifices when the implementation date arrives. There are still several months before the implementation date, and the procedures with several countries have not yet been completed. Discussions can continue with these countries, but before December 31 of this year, not only should they sign, but the approval and other procedures should also be completed. After January 1, 1932, everything falls within the scope of judicial matters. Before this period, the organization of the court, the appointment of judges, the hiring of consultants, the equipment of houses, and the planning of economy are also the work of the judiciary. In addition to the abolition of consular jurisdiction this year, the work of recovering concessions and leased territories is being stepped up, following the central government's intention to proceed according to the method of restoring tariff autonomy.

<h3>Major Riot in Spain</h3>
<p>Royalist Election Propaganda Incites Popular Anger</p>
<p>Civil Guards Open Fire to Suppress, Leading to Bloodshed</p>
<p>Shops Close</p>
<p>Traffic Halted</p>
<p>The National News Agency's Madrid dispatch on the 11th: The Spanish capital was gripped by riots last night, triggered by royalist election propaganda, leaving the public in great fear. This morning, all key positions in the city were guarded by civil guards, while the military was prepared for action. All traffic was temporarily suspended for security. The disturbances stemmed from a newly established independent royalist association, which hired several cars to parade through the streets, shouting slogans welcoming the restoration of the monarchy and overthrowing the republic. Citizens immediately gathered to attack the slogan shouters, overturning their cars and setting them on fire. They then marched to the ABC newspaper, the mouthpiece of the royalist faction, attempting to break in. Police efforts to disperse the crowd proved ineffective, leading them to open fire, injuring more than twenty people. News of the royalist procession spread throughout the city, and residents formed groups, parading through the streets, singing revolutionary songs and supporting the republic until dawn. During the chaos, several armories were looted, and minor clashes erupted. The situation was further complicated by communist agitation, leading to even greater disorder. Additionally, due to one colleague being injured by the royalists, with his life hanging in the balance, the car drivers were also threatening to strike. The authorities have temporarily closed the ABC newspaper and issued warrants for the arrest of its owner after discovering hidden weapons and ammunition within the building, indicating preparations for a reactionary plot.</p>
<p>Reuters' Madrid dispatch on the 11th: Last night's disturbances were considerable, with gunfire heard from time to time outside the Ministry of the Interior. One person was beaten to death by the mob. The mob robbed three military stores on Toledo Street, taking weapons to attack the civil guards. They then went to a newspaper office, throwing stones at the fifty civil guards guarding the office. The civil guards fired into the air, and the demonstrators scattered, trampling each other. The air was filled with curses and complaints from men and women. Public sentiment is agitated, but there are no serious acts of misconduct yet.</p>
<p>Reuters' Madrid dispatch on the 11th: Last night's disturbances resulted in two deaths. The government then issued a statement, stating that anyone, whether right-wing or left-wing, who attempts to disrupt public order will be considered an enemy of the republic. Today's cabinet meeting will find ways to implement this decision. The Literary and Art Club passed a motion demanding (1) the immediate disbandment of the civil guards, (2) the resignation of the Minister of the Interior, and (3) the expulsion of all religious teachers.</p>
<p>Reuters' Madrid dispatch on the 11th: Although the government announced that the riots had ended, there was still rioting this morning, with the Jesuit headquarters being set on fire, while onlookers stood by and watched.</p>
<p>Reuters' Madrid dispatch on the 11th: The efforts of the Socialist Trade Union to persuade workers to resume work have completely failed. Trams, streetcars, and subways are unable to run on schedule. Many factories and workshops have ceased operations. It is rumored that large groups of workers are marching towards the capital from the countryside. Troops are patrolling all major avenues in the city, and many shops have closed. The riots were largely caused by the authorities' release of General Berenguer. Workers saw this as government weakness, unaware that Berenguer had not been subject to military prosecution. The mob set fire to a convent, but fortunately, the nuns had evacuated beforehand. Many prominent royalists have now fled.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Formed in Portugal</h3>

<h3>French Presidential Election</h3>
<p>To Be Held Tomorrow at the Palace of Versailles</p>
<p>Doumer and Briand Are Promising Candidates</p>
<p>The National News Agency's Paris dispatch on the 10th: Members of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies will convene on Wednesday at the historically famous Palace of Versailles to elect a new president. According to custom, after the voting is completed, the remaining members who have not voted will be called upon by name, one by one. After this is completed, the ballots will be opened and counted. In the first or second round of voting, a candidate must receive more than half of the votes to be elected. After the election, the winner will immediately travel by special car to the Presidential Palace to notify the outgoing president of the election results. There are 608 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 350 members of the Senate. However, excluding those who are ill or absent due to other matters, it is feared that there will be fewer than 900 people voting this time. The election will be opened by Doumer, the Speaker of the Senate. However, during the voting, because Doumer and Vice President Lebrun are both presidential candidates, someone else will chair the proceedings.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Repeatedly Negligent</h3>
<p>Letter to Russia Lost</p>
<p>Suspected Sabotage</p>
<p>The National News Agency's Moscow dispatch on the 10th: Local newspapers are quite surprised by the loss of the letter from League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond to the Soviet government inviting it to participate in the Pan-European Conference. The letter was not registered when it was mailed due to forgetfulness. Even stranger, the first invitation letter was not dated and was mistakenly addressed to the government of Iceland, thus failing to be delivered. Therefore, public opinion holds that such instances of confusion and disorder may occasionally occur unexpectedly, otherwise, someone must be deliberately creating illusions in order to prevent the Soviet Union from attending the conference. The full text of the original letter has now been telegraphed from Geneva to the Soviet Commissariat of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Convening International Silver Conference</h3>
<p>Britain, America, and France Unwilling to Take the Lead</p>
<p>Reuters' Washington dispatch on the 9th: The International Chamber of Commerce today passed without debate the motion, already approved by the committee on motions yesterday, to convene an international conference to solve the current silver problem. After this motion was passed, the question arose of who would convene the world silver conference. Several parties pointed out two points: first, the case did not specify which country should be the leader; second, most major countries are unwilling to take any action. As for the US government, it has already stated that it is unwilling to take the lead. Senator King, who represents the silver mining industry in the western United States, facilitated the passage of this motion and admitted to Congress that he did not dare to be confident that it would succeed. Britain and France are also unlikely to be the initiators of the silver conference. China is certainly the country that most hopes for the success of this conference, but whether China has sufficient strength to lead this movement is questionable. The same is true for Mexico. Some say that Japan, which has extremely important relations in trade with China, may initiate it, but the views expressed by the Japanese representatives attending the International Chamber of Commerce congress do not align with this view, as the Japanese views may change in the future.</p>
<p>Associated Press' Washington dispatch on the 10th: Senator Borah of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today gave a radio speech, strongly praising the International Chamber of Commerce's passage of the international silver conference proposal, saying that the disastrously low silver price has become a very big problem, which cannot be solved by simply passing a motion or by the people alone. Governments of all countries must work together to address it. Today, 800 million people have seen their purchasing power suddenly reduced due to the drop in silver prices. It will not be possible to restore the purchasing power of half the world's people until governments pay attention to this matter and find ways to restore silver's proper position as a generally recognized medium of exchange of considerable value.</p>
<h3>British Envoy to China Tours Singapore</h3>
<p>Related to Recognition of the Kuomintang</p>
<p>Reuters' Singapore dispatch on the 11th: Sir Miles Lampson, the British Envoy to China, recently toured Singapore, discussing the recognition of the Kuomintang with Malayan officials. The former Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Cecil Clementi, after being transferred as the Governor of the Straits Settlements, issued a notice designating the Kuomintang as an illegal society in Malaya. It is now learned that the Malayan government and the Chinese government have agreed on the status of the Kuomintang in Singapore: if the Kuomintang is formed entirely outside Malaya and does not establish branches in the Straits Settlements, then the Malayan government may not regard it as an illegal society. Sir Miles Lampson and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang have exchanged documents to this effect.</p>

<p>Reuters' Tokyo dispatch on the 11th: The worker who climbed the chimney of the Japanese Textile Company on May 1 remains perched atop it, showing no signs of fatigue. However, due to continuous cold rain, his body must be damaged. It is said that the authorities have decided to send a doctor up the ladder to care for him and take the opportunity to persuade him to come down. However, there have been attempts to do this before, and the worker firmly stated that he would not come down until his goal was achieved. If forced too much, he threatened to jump off the chimney and commit suicide. Breaking News</p>
<h3>Central Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Report on Following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Will</p>
<p>A Clear Observation on the Guangdong Situation</p>
<p>On May 11th, at 8:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held its 111th Memorial Week. Due to the convening of the National Assembly, all Central Committee members and government officials were required to attend the National Assembly, so the National Government Memorial Week was held jointly at the Central Party Headquarters. Attendees included Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Ding Weifen, Yang Shuzhuang, Ding Chaowu, Wang Boling, Miao Peicheng, Chen Guofu, Yu Jingtang, Chen Lifu, government officials Wang Shuhan, and heads of various ministries and commissions Ma Fuxiang, Cao Haosen, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, and all staff members from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the General Staff Headquarters, and the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, totaling over 1,000 people. Chairman Ding Weifen presided over the meeting, and after the music was played and the ceremonial formalities were completed, Chairman Chiang delivered a report, stating roughly: "When we read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, the last two sentences are: 'Recently, the advocacy for convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties must be realized in the shortest possible time.'" Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated for convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties, and now it has been eight years. Now the National Assembly has been convened, and unequal treaties will also be abolished. In this situation, not only are comrades happy, but the people across the nation are also greatly comforted, and world public opinion also expresses sympathy towards us. Everyone believes that after the completion of the National Assembly, our country will have bright hope, and the goal of abolishing treaties can be fully achieved. All party members and all citizens should be encouraged to earnestly respect and implement the resolutions of this important National Assembly, so as not to fail Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and the public opinion of the National Assembly. Then the country's unification and construction will have a path to follow, and the revolutionary goals can be achieved. This is the greatest achievement in history. Unexpectedly, during this construction period, rumors in Guangdong suddenly arose. The Guangdong issue is a party issue because Guangdong is the revolutionary base. Dr. Sun Yat-sen made revolutions in Guangdong, sacrificing countless lives and property, to achieve Guangdong's unification. Through Guangdong's unification, with the efforts of comrades, national unification was achieved. This was a very difficult process. This time, the four supervisory committee members including Gu Yingfen sent a telegram impeaching me personally. Standing on the party's position, I can only ask the party to investigate. Right and wrong will be judged fairly. There is no need for personal disputes. Party affairs should be resolved by the party. Originally, it was a very ordinary matter. Unexpectedly, at this time, Chen Jitang suddenly sent a telegram in response to the four supervisory committee members, including Gu. Soldiers take obeying orders as their duty. Interference in politics is not allowed, and interference in party affairs is even more prohibited. Chen Jitang's actions are extremely wrong and harmful to military discipline, national discipline, and party discipline. However, Chen Jitang wanted to take the opportunity to develop his power, and the intention did not arise in one day. Originally, Chen Jitang and Chen Mingshu did not get along. The reason why Chen Jitang and Chen Mingshu did not get along was related to economics. Chen Jitang's 8th Route Army has only five divisions. According to the army regulations, the monthly cost is only 1.5 million yuan. However, Chen Jitang in Guangdong takes whatever he wants from the central and local funds. He needs 4.3 million yuan per month, and Guangxi is where his troops are stationed, which can collect 800,000 yuan per month. Five divisions need more than 5 million yuan in military expenses per month. Isn't this strange? Because Chen Mingshu was the chairman in Guangdong, he inevitably had a few words about Chen Jitang's behavior. Chen Jitang, hindered by Chen Mingshu, could not get whatever he wanted, so he had to get rid of Chen Mingshu. Chen Mingshu in Guangdong, due to Chen Jitang's various obstructions, could not handle the suppression of bandits. He had long intended to resign, but the central government persuaded him to stay. Now Chen Mingshu has been forced to leave Guangzhou, and Chen Jitang can do whatever he wants. It is rumored that Chen Jitang will unite with Zhang Gui to resist the central government. If Chen is a party member, he must know that the country is in danger and construction is not easy. Hopefully, he will not do this. If he acts solely on impulse, disregarding the party and the country, disregarding everything, and willingly becomes a second Chen Jiongming, then where public opinion lies, Chen will not succeed either, but will only eliminate and sacrifice himself in the party's history and will not be able to support himself for several months like Chen Jiongming. Because the current situation in Guangdong is that not only do the people yearn for peace, but the military also loathes chaos. If he cooperates with Zhang Gui, Chen Jitang may not be so foolish. Because of the crimes Zhang Gui committed in Guangdong, the people and the military in Guangdong hate Zhang Gui to the bone. From this, it can be inferred that Chen Jitang will never violate the party and the country, violate public opinion, and violate the military's morale, and embark on the same path of failure as Chen Jiongming, to become a sinner for all time. On Guangdong rumors,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Analysis: (1) Chen Jitang may not be willing to sacrifice the party's history; (2) cooperation with Zhang Gui's army may not be possible; (3) the people and the military in Guangdong are extremely tired of chaos. With these three reasons, Chen Jitang is unlikely to dare to betray the party and the country. If Chen Jitang dares to betray the party and the country, he will become the public enemy of the world, and the central government will have its own way of dealing with it. Please rest assured, and do not listen to rumors lightly, alarming each other. Always be calm, implement the resolutions of the National Assembly, and strive to abolish unequal treaties. Today, because the National Assembly is in session, I cannot report much. The Guangdong incident is likely not to be a big problem. That's all. After the report, the music was played, the ceremony was completed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Pillar of Guangdong, Armory Explosion</h3>
<p>Six or Seven Storage Rooms Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>Over Ten Dead, Eleven Injured</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: There is an old-style fort at the end of Ershatou on the Dongdi in Guangzhou, named Zhongliudizhu (Pillar of the Midstream). The fort faces the Pearl River and is surrounded by stone walls. There are buildings inside, which used to be barracks. Since the opening of maritime trade, the situation of the Pearl River has changed, and the fort has almost become a ruin. However, the authorities believe that the location is in the suburbs, towering and isolated, most suitable for storing military ammunition, believing that even if there is danger, it will not affect the residents. Therefore, after the founding of the Republic of China, the fort was only a name, but it has become an armory. In 1926, a fire explosion occurred in the armory, but the loss was minimal. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, a second explosion occurred, which was also very tragic. Recently, since the changes in the Guangdong situation and the city's martial law, two of the four regiments of the security team trained by the former Security Office still remain in the suburbs and Huangpu. The Pillar of the Midstream armory also has the second platoon of the third company of the security team stationed there, and there is no difference in safety. However, today (the 5th) at about 7:40 AM, a loud noise like thunder was heard, and the roofs and tiles shook. Neighbors also felt the windows and doors shaking violently at the time, with great force. Some said it was an earthquake, and some said it was lightning. Soon, fire trucks from the fire brigade were mobilized. When asked about the reason, it was said that they had just received a call from the Pillar of the Midstream, reporting that the armory had exploded and they were rushing to put out the fire. Afterwards, after many inquiries, it was learned that the explosion occurred in the iron-clad warehouse in the eastern corner of the fort. More than ten boxes of gunpowder for making aircraft bombs, which had been transported from the central government a few days ago, were stored in the warehouse. Somehow, a bombing occurred this morning, and the blast spread to the white powder warehouse in the western corner. Therefore, the sound shook the valley when the bombing happened. It is estimated that several rooms in the iron-clad warehouse in the eastern corner were completely destroyed, and four ridgepoles of the buildings in the western corner also collapsed. The collapsed walls on both sides were five to six zhang long, and the tiles and stones flew. The foundation of the iron warehouse suddenly became a puddle, six to seven chi deep. Fortunately, the warehouse storing mortar shells in the western corner was not affected, which is considered fortunate among the misfortunes. After the explosion, the remaining embers reignited, and the flames were not extinguished. The security team leader He, who was stationed there, and the administrator of the fort, immediately telegraphed the headquarters, the fire department, and the navy department. Soon, the headquarters sent dozens of military policemen to suppress the situation. The fire brigade used ships to transport fire engines to put out the fire, and one side transported the unburned shells, and the other rescued the victims. On the spot, they rescued four heavily injured guards, Huang, Yang, Su, and Yuan. The other slightly injured persons included security team soldiers Luo, Li, Yang, Luo, Yao, and Tan, and seven others, who were sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. In addition, there were about 20 workers in the headquarters barracks that were under construction. During the fire after the explosion, five or six workers who escaped were injured. Fifteen or sixteen people have not been seen escaping, and they are thought to have been killed in the explosion or buried in the fire pit. (May 5th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government's Loans and Bond Issues</h3>
<p>Xiamen's Bank of China Loan Established</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The financial situation of Fujian Province is difficult, and military needs are also urgent. A few days ago, Finance Director He Gonggan borrowed 60,000 yuan in cash from the Central Bank to cope with the situation. However, the Central Bank believed that the repayment method should be divided into three months, starting from May, from the central coordinated loan, while the Finance Department believed that its financial resources were limited and could only repay 10,000 yuan per month, and should be repaid in six months. Therefore, telegrams were exchanged back and forth, and no agreement has been reached. Yesterday, the Provincial Government telegraphed the board of directors of the Central Bank, requesting that the branch be ordered to allocate the funds as soon as possible to solve the urgent need. In addition, the Finance Department had previously entrusted Chen Peikun to go to Xiamen to borrow 120,000 yuan from the Bank of China, using 320,000 yuan in treasury notes as collateral, with a one-year term, and the Finance Department would allocate 10,000 yuan per month to repay the bank. Both parties have completed negotiations, and the contract has been established. As for the city's promotion of treasury notes, although efforts have been made, most merchants have asked the General Chamber of Commerce to be exempted from the burden because of insufficient business strength. The Finance Department very much wants the promotion to succeed. It is said that a method has been determined, which is to increase the 80,000 yuan of provincial bonds that were previously allocated by four times, and require the General Chamber of Commerce to convene various chambers of commerce to pay in equal installments. In order to maintain credit, He also sent a letter to the Fuzhou branch of the Central Bank in advance, fearing that the central coordinated loan would not arrive on time, requesting that 55,000 yuan be allocated from the overdraft amount on a monthly basis and handed over to the Bank of China for safekeeping as the treasury bond fund.

<h3>Qingdao</h3>
<p>Fisheries Company Strives for Development</p>
<p>Draft Articles of Association of the Company Amended and Passed</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sternly Rejects Japanese Ships' Encroachment on Our Fishing Rights</p>
<p>Jiaozhou Customs Exempts Our Fishing Vessels from Various Restrictions</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Weihai, Longkou, and Yantai for Fishing Vessels to Sail to Qingdao</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Fisheries Company opened on May 1st. Today (8th) at 9:00 AM, the company's promoters held a meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce. More than 30 people attended. Chairman Song Yuting presented the draft articles of association and passed them with amendments. As for the company's content, its outline is as follows: 1. To assist fishermen in developing fisheries; 2. To engage in the following matters: (1) Purchasing fishing vessels to catch fish; (2) Establishing fish markets to sell fish; (3) Establishing cold storage to store fish; (4) Establishing a financial department to facilitate fishermen; (5) Manufacturing and selling various fishing gears; (6) Applying for fishing areas to cultivate aquatic products; (7) Planning factories to manufacture aquatic products; (8) Other matters related to fisheries. In addition, the total amount of the company's shares is 500,000 national currency, divided into 10,000 shares, each share is 50 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refuted the unreasonable demands of Japanese ships encroaching on Qingdao's fishing rights based on reason and has informed the City Chamber of Commerce. Jiaozhou Customs has also exempted our country's fishing vessels from the previous various restrictions, and has sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to inform the fishing vessels to comply. The letters and telegrams from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Jiaozhou Customs are recorded below: (1) The telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "The Jiang telegram has been received. It is found that the purpose of this customs ban is to crack down on illegal ships and Japanese fishing vessels from engaging in fishing using Chinese ports as bases. However, the Japanese side, citing the provisions of the Shandong Treaty's vested rights, requested to continue. We have now refuted this based on reason. During this negotiation period, we have agreed with the Ministries of Finance and Industry to temporarily postpone implementation. As for the Japanese vessels not being allowed to fish in our territorial waters, the Japanese side also recognizes this. If there are more accurate facts about Japanese vessels poaching in the local area, please report them to the ministry in detail. Special reply, and please inform. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (seal)"; (2) The letter from Jiaozhou Customs, "In the case of your association's letter opening etc. Because of this, I found that there are no specific regulations for managing fishing vessels. That is to say, the representative of the Fishing Vessel General Association, Wang Fengshan, stated in the original letter that more than 70 fishing vessels in the Yellow and Bohai Seas also submitted applications to the Ministry of Communications for the issuance of licenses in accordance with the Ship Registration Regulations. Therefore, since our customs has no specific regulations to follow for fishing vessels, it should be handled in accordance with ordinary merchant ships. However, the General Chamber of Commerce said that our customs has added restrictions, which is unavoidable misunderstanding. However, the General Association said that the deposit of the ship license with our customs has various inconveniences, which is understandable in reality. Our tax department is considering how to change the method within a possible range in order to facilitate and promote development. The two members of the City Chamber of Commerce, Yu and Yao, accompanied by Yang Jinsheng, the director of the City Social Bureau, came to the customs and discussed this matter with our tax department, and proposed five flexible methods. After detailed review, it was decided to be used as temporary import and export rules for fishing vessels. On the one hand, our tax department will submit the rules to the Directorate General of Customs through the Commissioner of Customs for review and processing. If approved by the government, it can be used as a special chapter. In view of the above, in addition to informing various customs of the above temporary rules and ordering them to be followed, a corresponding reply is sent and a copy of the rules is sent to your association. Please forward it to the Fishing Vessel General Association for information. The rules are recorded below: 1. All fishing vessels entering the port must present their ship license and fill out the import declaration, stating that they are from a certain port or fishing in a certain port's sea area, without the need to submit a cabin manifest and a customs clearance document. 2. All fishing vessels exiting the port must carry a ship license and fill out the export declaration, stating that they are heading to a certain port or fishing in a certain port's sea area, without the need to obtain a customs clearance document. 3. All fishing vessels entering and exiting Qingdao must report to the Xiaogang sub-customs for inspection and release at any time. If passing through other sub-customs under this customs, they shall be treated the same as sailboats, without the restriction of the inner port. 4. All fishing vessels purchasing fish boxes and other ship supplies are exempt from export tax. 5. All fishing vessels mentioned in these rules refer to engine-powered fishing vessels, and are limited to those with the nationality of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Because Jiaozhou Customs has exempted the previous various restrictions, the Qingdao City Chamber of Commerce has sent telegrams to the Weihai, Longkou, and Yantai Chambers of Commerce, requesting them to inform the fishing vessel merchants to sail to Qingdao to save maritime rights together. The telegram said, "The Qingdao Fisheries Company's fish market has opened. Jiaozhou Customs has now exempted the previous various restrictions on our country's fishing vessels. Please quickly inform the fishing vessel merchants to sail here as soon as possible to save maritime rights together and promote development. Please do not delay. Qingdao City Chamber of Commerce (fish) (May 8th)</p>

<h3>Zhu and Mao's Troops Retreat to Ningdu</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The propaganda branch of the Fifth Division telegraphed the headquarters from Guangchang yesterday, reporting in detail on the recent bandit situation, stating roughly that Luo Binghui's Red Bandit Pseudo 12th Army is entrenched in Ningdu City. Zhu De and Mao Zedong's troops are stationed in the Diaofeng, Dongshao, Donggu, and Qingtang areas of Ningdu. Huang Gonglue's troops were originally in Yongfeng. After Yaotian and Tengtian were successively recovered by the Fifth Route Army, they fled to the mountains on the borders of Yongfeng, Yihuang, and Ningdu counties. Peng Dehuai's troops were originally in Donggu. Due to the encirclement and suppression by the Gong Division and the Fifth Route Army, they moved in three routes to Dongshanba (northwest of Ningdu), Jietian, and Huling areas. Hu Zhusheng's troops were originally bandits from Nanfeng and Guangfeng. After being incorporated by Zhu and Mao, they disturbed the areas bordering Jiangxi and Fujian in eastern Jiangxi. The troops are now based in Kuzu and other places on the border of Guangchang and Yongfeng. There are no large Red Bandit troops within Guangchang. The Red Bandit center is currently in Ningdu. There are also many bandits in Ruijin, Shicheng, and Huichang. The government troops are clearing and suppressing them step by step.</p>
<p>After the two Red Bandit troops of Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping in eastern Jiangxi were severely suppressed by Ruan Zhaochang and Tang Sibo's troops, they fled from Qianshan and Guangfeng to Pucheng and Chong'an in northern Fujian. After being repelled by Qian Yuguang's brigade and Lin Bingzhou's brigade of marines, Fang led more than 700 people to attack Shangmei in Chong'an, colluding with more than 2,000 bandits, looting and burning wantonly. They were still besieged by Qian Yuguang and Lin Bingzhou's brigades on three sides. Many bandits died, and only 300 to 400 people fled to Taian on the border of Jiangxi. Currently, the stationed troops on both sides of Jiangxi and Fujian have joined forces to encircle and suppress them, hoping to annihilate them. (9th)</p>
<h3>Hankou Laopu</h3>
<p>Two Bombing Cases at the Amusement Park</p>
<p>A Tragedy in which Nine Tourists were Injured in Total</p>
<p>Military and Police Authorities have Strictly Restricted Soldiers</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Laopu Amusement Park has been established for the longest time and is the only privately-run amusement park in Hankou. On the 26th of last month, it was discovered that someone had thrown a bomb at the park, injuring two tourists. The garrison headquarters arrested the murderer on the spot. It was learned that he was a soldier from the Hankou office of Gong Bingfan's 28th Division. Because the office is close to the park, many soldiers go to the park. After the case occurred, the garrison headquarters planned to deal with it strictly according to the law, but the office submitted a letter of guarantee for release. For the sake of maintaining law and order, the police department convened a temporary meeting to discuss rectifying military discipline and cracking down on wounded soldiers causing trouble. It was generally decided that all soldiers sent out must wear various armbands. For example, orderlies must wear order badges, duty soldiers must wear duty badges, and purchasing soldiers must wear purchasing badges. Those on leave must wear fire-branded leave badges. If they do not have the above badges and go out privately, the garrison troops will arrest them all and send them to the department for confinement to show punishment. It was also decided to implement this on May 1st. Unexpectedly, the case has not been resolved, and there has been another incident of soldiers throwing bombs and injuring people. On the 8th of this month, when the Hankou Theater was performing, a bomb suddenly flew in from outside the wall and exploded with a loud noise, piercing the board wall. Suddenly, the order was in chaos. After the troops stationed in the park suppressed the situation, it calmed down slightly. After investigation, a total of seven people were injured, all seriously injured and lost consciousness. After receiving the report, the Xingying Detective Office, the 48th Division Military Police Battalion, the Garrison Department Investigation Office, and the Public Security Bureau Detective Team sent soldiers to maintain order and assist in strictly arresting the culprit. At the same time, the injured spectators were sent to Xiehe Hospital for treatment. As of the 9th, the seriously injured were still not out of danger. The person in charge of the park said that soldiers throwing bombs had been seen twice in half a month, which was a great impediment to the safety of tourists and the park's business. Therefore, they reported to the Xingying and Garrison Headquarters again, requesting strict prohibition. After receiving the report, the police department ordered the military to strictly restrict the soldiers and arrest the murderers, and properly plan for the aftermath. (May 9th)</p>

They apprehended four crew members and seized forty-seven packages of poison pills, each containing ten bags, totaling approximately 470,000 pills (some say 560,000 pills). While preparing to take the pills to the district for verification, Zhou, a member of the Qingyang Security Corps of the 11th District Office of Jiangyin, led more than ten members of the corps, along with Inspector Hu Shouren of the 2nd Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who also sent personnel to inquire about the ship, leading to discord.

When he inquired at the Qitai Inn, he asked the tea server, Jia, about Longda's arrival at the inn in detail. The tea server presented the letter sent to You Zhenchu for his viewing. After reading the letter, Chen Zhongzhang suspected that You Zhenchu was involved and immediately took the letter to You Zhenchu's home on the Dahe River, arrested You Zhenchu and took him to the Public Security First Branch in charge. After a preliminary interrogation by a staff member of the branch, considering that the case involved criminal matters, he immediately prepared a document and transferred it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. After Director Wang opened the court for questioning, he ordered Chen Zhongzhang to return home, while You Zhenchu was temporarily detained, awaiting transfer to the court for adjudication.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Zheng Hongnian</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper's Nanjing special dispatch on May 5th stated, "Zheng Hongnian said that this political crisis will definitely not escalate, nor will it lead to military action. A certain foreign envoy's Guangzhou three-evening telegram stated, 'Guangzhou's affairs are most excited by Gu Yingfen alone, who concurrently serves as Chairman of the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments. A small number of Chen Jitang's subordinates participated, and Chen was passive. Outsiders see the Chinese situation as not serious. The political crisis has been revealed, and the Central Committees believe there is no need to keep secrets. Zhang Ji and Dai Jitao both visited Hu Hanmin and had very pleasant talks. Hu intends to come out. The situation is only a matter of Hu's attendance, and everything will be settled.'" Upon investigation, Hongnian did not make any comments regarding the Guangdong incident. Please publish this letter in accordance with newspaper conventions to make a correction, for which I would be greatly appreciative. Zheng Hongnian, May 11th.</p>
<p>Note: In that newspaper's special dispatch, the phrase "a certain foreign envoy's Guangzhou three-evening telegram" and the following words were originally in a separate telegram. Due to haste, they were mistakenly placed in one telegram. We hereby clarify this.</p>

The inauguration hall was prepared by the General Affairs Section in the company's staff clubhouse. A portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the party and national flags were hung. The scheduled inauguration ceremony for the commissioner was very simple: (1) Everyone stood at attention; (2) Bowed to the party and national flags and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; (3) Read Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament; (4) All staff congratulated the commissioner and bowed; (5) Commissioner's speech; (6) Ceremony concludes.</p>

There were over two hundred staff members from the various sections, departments, four wharves, and ships. Li Yunliang, Director of the Hankou Office, Lin Zhisheng, Director of the Jiujiang Office, Wang Kaiping, Director of the Anqing Office, and the Director of the Xiamen Office all came to the company to listen to the speech.</p>
<p>Commissioner's Speech After the inauguration ceremony, Commissioner Guo addressed all the staff, stating, "Brothers, I am assuming the position of Commissioner of this company today and am very happy to meet with you all. In handling affairs, I have always focused on being pragmatic and not indulging in empty talk. All future measures will be based on this principle to ensure practicality. I hope that you will also adhere to this principle and strive to advance in your respective work. Then the results will be impressive. Regarding the selection of personnel, I will be fair and impartial. You have served in the company for many years, and as long as you are diligent and cautious in your duties, I am not inclined to make changes lightly. You can rest assured and focus on your work and uphold your responsibilities. My colleagues and I are in the same boat and must work together to overcome difficulties. In the future, there will be many opportunities for consultation and discussion on the reorganization of the company. I have only briefly outlined the main points and hope for your understanding." Commissioner Guo wore formal attire and spoke very earnestly, briefly and directly, expressing his pure businessman nature throughout.</p>
<p>Appointment of Staff After assuming office, Commissioner Guo announced the appointment of Zeng Guangyi as Head of the Business Section, Liu Ruxiang as Head of the General Affairs Section, Chen Riping as Head of the Accounting Section, and Bao Gongfan, Chen Guoquan, Jin Xueteng, and Wang Zhongfang as Secretaries. Wang Yuqu, Director of the Treasury, has resigned and Shen Yaoqing has been appointed to succeed him. Before Chen Riping arrives, Chen Guoquan will act as Head of the Accounting Section. The position of Chief Secretary has been abolished. Except for Chen Riping, all the section chiefs and secretaries came to the company yesterday to take up their duties.</p>
<p>Handling of the Handover The handover procedures of the former administration were overseen by Shen Zhongyi, Head of the Business Section.

Bao, representing Commissioner Guo, told the reporters, "This company is in a dilapidated state with many flaws and urgently needs reorganization. At present, we must carefully examine and study the current situation and future needs before we can formulate a concrete reorganization plan. Commissioner Guo has always focused on being pragmatic and does not indulge in empty talk, so he is not inclined to say much. This is also the principle of not saying much in governance. This company is the largest navigation organization in the country and is closely related to the country and its people. In the future, we hope that the media will provide guidance on the company's measures so that the company's business will improve day by day. This is our hope."</p>
<p>The Wharf Strike Resolved The staff of the four wharves expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the previous distribution of bonuses and the unpaid wages for August were not treated equally with the company staff, leading to a strike. Section Chief Shen Zhongyi stepped in to mediate and promised to submit a request on their behalf after the new Director-General took office. Yesterday, after Commissioner Guo assumed office, the managers of the four wharves sent representatives to the company to request instructions. After negotiations with Zeng Guangyi, Head of the Navigation Section, it was agreed that the unpaid wages for August, originally paid with checks dated June 19th, would be paid in cash today. At the same time, the staff of the four wharves were ordered to return to work as usual. This matter has been resolved satisfactorily. Zeng once served as Director of the Navigation Bureau during Zhao Tieqiao's tenure. This time, the Ministry appointed him as Director of the Harbin Navigation Bureau, but Zeng did not go and returned to his current position. He is familiar with the job and should be able to handle it quickly and happily.</p>

Jin Xueteng is from Zhejiang. Liu Ruxiang is from Zhongshan and graduated from the Agricultural Science Department of Tokyo Imperial University. He has held positions in the Ministry of Finance and the Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau of the Bank of China. The original secretaries of the company, Song Shuchiao, Shi Naizheng, Zhou Shucheng, and Zheng Zhiding, have all resigned. Bao, Jin, Chen, and Wang have succeeded them.

The news has spread and we are filled with admiration. We respectfully represent the women of the entire city in wholeheartedly supporting you. We still ask you to strive and struggle to achieve our goals. We look forward to it and wish you good health."</p>
<p>A letter from the world representative Fan Qinwen stated, "Respectfully, I have recently learned from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce about the origins of the Singapore Great World's affiliated exhibit, which seeks to showcase the company's Bailin Land Wine, with the intention of promoting patriotism. I admire your enthusiasm. I have considered that Chinese wine was invented in the Xia Dynasty and flourished in the Tang Dynasty. Fragrant and pure wine was already praised long ago. However, as time has passed, those engaged in this industry have either lost their way, recklessly brewing, or are only interested in profits, reducing the original ingredients and not making progress or paying attention to hygiene, so that imported products..."</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Association</h3>
<p>A Letter to Lu Feibo Hong</p>
<p>Discussing the Dispute Between the Beining and Kailuan Railways</p>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Coal Industry Association to Lu Feibo Hong stated, "Respectfully, after reading your discussion about Kailuan coal transport in Shanghai newspapers on May 8, it seemed as if you were personally experiencing it. After reading it, we have one point of doubt and one point that should be added.</p>
<p>Point of Doubt: You said, 'According to the regulations of the Beining Railway, ordinary merchants who transport goods are allocated cars by the railway bureau. If the goods are not fully loaded within 24 hours, they must pay a fine. However, the transportation contract signed between Kailuan and Beining does not have a clear provision on this point. Because Kailuan uses as many as 200 cars, the current Beining authorities are demanding that Kailuan pay more than 1.2 million yuan in backdated car delay fees over the years, which Kailuan refuses to admit.' If the facts are indeed as such, then the fault lies with the Beining Railway Bureau. Upon investigation, the rights of the Kailuan Coal Mine are controlled by British merchants, and its general office deliberation department is located far away in Tianjin. The Kailuan sales office in Shanghai is a sole distributor, managed by Mr. Liu Hongsheng. Whether the content of this dispute is purely as described above is not certain. If relying on Kailuan's one-sided propaganda, it is inevitable that it will be biased. After all, whether the current Beining authorities' demand for payment is purely a car delay fee, and whether this car delay fee is nominally a fine, all members of the coal industry are eager to know the truth. However, the news came from your discussion, and the right and wrong are revealed between the lines. The Association members know that you are not very close to the British merchants who control the rights to the Kailuan Coal Mine. This discussion seems to be true, which makes the members of the Association feel suspicious.</p>
<p>Point to Add: You said, 'The Kailuan General Company was formed in the first year of the Republic of China by the merger of the Kaiping and Luanzhou companies.' With the approval of the Chinese and British governments' treaties, it was stipulated that after ten years, the Luan Mining Company could purchase all the assets of Kaiping at a fair price. If our country reclaims it according to the treaty, the British side cannot object. Regarding the redemption price, it was previously said by the Beijing-Tianjin Times that it would require 70 million yuan. Now that the gold price is high, it would be no more than 100 million yuan.' Upon investigation, the Kaiping Mining Bureau was originally a joint venture between officials and merchants such as Tang Tingshu. After Tang died, Zhang Yi took over. At the time of the Boxer Rebellion, the Kaiping Mining Bureau was occupied by Russian soldiers. Then the mining engineer Hu Hua (an American representing the British merchant Molin) used his aggressive methods and acquired all the assets of the Kaiping Mining Bureau without paying any price. This happened on February 19, 1901. Later, on June 1, 1912, it cooperated with the Luanzhou Mining Company and jointly organized the Kailuan Mining General Bureau. The draft contract stated, '(1) The Kaiping Mining Company and the Luanzhou Mining Company, for the purpose of developing business, jointly organize and establish a Kailuan Mining General Bureau. Both companies retain their original status and operate according to the Limited Company Regulations. This general bureau shall be established and filed with the Beiyang Minister in accordance with the Chinese-foreign joint venture mining regulations. (2) According to this contract, the share capital of the two companies shall remain the same, with Kaiping having a share capital of 1 million pounds and Luanzhou having a share capital of 1 million pounds.' (Middle omitted) '17. From the date of signing this contract, ten years later, the Luan Mining Company shall have the right to repurchase all the assets of the Kaiping Company at a fair value agreed upon by both parties.' (End omitted) Until the 15th year of the Republic of China, when Yang Wenkai was the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, he planned to reclaim it. In the 16th year, when Zhang Jinghui was the Minister of Industry, he also intended to reclaim it. In the end, it was interrupted because the British in Kaiping deliberately delayed and created obstacles. You said that if our country reclaims it according to the treaty, the British side cannot object, which is the opposite of the facts. This is indeed greatly related to national power and cannot be judged by theory. As for the words of the Beijing-Tianjin Times, they are entirely the thoughts of British merchants. Think about it, the British merchants acquired all the assets of the Kaiping Mining Bureau without paying any price. In the thirty years since, they have seized countless tens of millions of yuan. How can they then, with a hypothetical share capital of 1 million pounds, want to reclaim it after joining with Luanzhou and set its price at 70 million yuan, or about 100 million yuan because of the high price of gold? Is this fair? Is this reasonable? If China can strengthen itself, in addition to reclaiming the Kaiping Mining assets without any price, it should also pursue compensation for damages to justify legal principles. The association believes that it is necessary to add this point to the general public's attention to your discussion, so that our people can know the truth. You are wise and will be able to express sympathy. However, the points of doubt in the association still hope to be clarified. Sincerely, Shanghai Coal Industry Association, May 10."</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Native Cloth Industry</h3>
<p>Petitioned the Consolidated Tax Office Yesterday</p>
<p>Customs Authorities Will Announce a Circular Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association, requesting the authorities to exempt them from customs duties, has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax and Customs Departments since the suspension of goods exports to resolve the issue as soon as possible and restore freight transport. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives from the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, a total of eight people, went to the Consolidated Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance on the second floor of the Jianghai Customs to petition again. They were received by Director Xie Qi and Section Chief Liang Zizhen of the Fifth Section. First, the cloth merchant representatives stated that the native cloth needed by ports such as the three northeastern provinces, transported from Shanghai, has been selling very little in the past few months, while foreign cloth is selling well, and the market share of native cloth in our country is increasing day by day. Although the provinces in the Northeast have telegraphed Shanghai to order goods since the suspension of transport, the customs duty exemption circular has not yet been announced, resulting in business stagnation. Director Xie then informed the cloth industry representatives that native cloth transported for sale in non-unified tax areas and abroad, has been exempt from customs duties after the office sent a letter to the customs department and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for approval. On the 9th, the office replied to the customs department for verification, ordering the General Customs Department to instruct the customs offices to comply. There is no longer a problem with the exemption of native cloth from customs duties. Due to the complicated procedures, the customs authorities will be able to announce the circular in about a week, it was said.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Knitting Industries</h3>
<p>Petition the Legislative Yuan to Exempt from Business Tax</p>
<p>Presenting Six Reasons</p>
<p>The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association, the National Goods Towel Industry Federation, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Dyeing Industry Federation, the Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association, the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association, the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association, the Wuxi Cloth Factory Industry Association, the Changshu Cloth Factory Industry Association, the Wuxian Cloth Factory Industry Association, the Jiangyin Cloth Factory Industry Association, and the Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan, stating: "Presenting supplemental reasons, laying out the situation, earnestly requesting that you consider the people's difficulties and approve a clear order to exempt the cotton textile manufacturing industry and its directly established wholesale or distribution centers from business tax in order to maintain the people's livelihood. Since our government implemented the business tax to compensate for the likin tax, the Ministry of Finance has issued a series of laws and regulations, clearly defining the outline in order to prevent arbitrary and excessive levies, which shows the government's care for industry and commerce. However, some provinces and cities have included the cotton textile manufacturing industry in the scope of collection, which is quite close to being harsh and exceeding the scope of the business tax collection outline promulgated by the Ministry. The associations have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry, and have publicly elected representatives to go to Nanjing to petition and present everything in person. Now, we will list the reasons again as follows: (1) Cotton textiles are a necessity for the daily life of ordinary people. Therefore, the cotton textile manufacturing industry has always been promoted and cared for by the government. According to the example of native cloth and machine-made national goods, it is generally exempt from heavy taxes and miscellaneous tolls along the way, which is a clear case. Since the implementation of the unified tax on cotton yarn, the consolidated tax paid by the cotton textile manufacturing industry for double-strand yarn above 42 counts has exceeded the previous customs tax rate. If an overlapping business tax is levied again, it not only runs counter to the government's purpose of cutting likin taxes to protect national products, but also seems to increase the burden and cause hardship to merchants and the people. This is reason one why the associations and their respective industries should be exempted from business tax. (2) Article 1 of the business tax outline stipulates that companies and businesses that have paid special central taxes or income taxes are exempt from business tax. The associations and their respective industries all pay a unified tax when purchasing yarn raw materials. According to the law, this should be a reason for exemption from business tax. (3) Article 4 of the detailed rules for the collection of the unified tax on cotton yarn promulgated by the Ministry of Finance stipulates that cotton yarn that has been taxed and its directly woven products are exempt from any other types of national, provincial, or local taxes in the interior. In addition, the Ministry of Finance's interpretation of the key points for the collection of business tax clearly stipulates that in addition to commercial firms and shops that sell and market, which must pay business tax, there is no provision for the manufacturing industry to pay business tax. The cotton textile manufacturing industry of the associations uses cotton yarn that has been taxed to manufacture directly woven products, so it should be exempt from business tax in order to comply with the law. This is reason three for requesting exemption from business tax. (4) Yarn factories are exempted from business tax on the grounds of being a manufacturing industry and paying a unified tax in name. Our cotton weaving industry is a manufacturing industry that actually bears the burden of the unified tax, but it cannot be exempted from business tax. Why is it so kind to them and so unkind to us? Moreover, the business tax is a tax on business activities. Yarn factories use cotton to manufacture yarn, and cotton textile factories use yarn to manufacture clothing and supplies. There is no difference in their activities. This is reason four for requesting exemption from business tax. (5) It is rumored that yarn factories with affiliated weaving factories are exempt from business tax. Therefore, foreign-owned yarn factories in China are adding cloth factories and cotton textile manufacturing factories. They only pay a consolidated tax on woven products and no longer pay business tax. Our national cotton textile industry, which purchases yarn for manufacturing products, must pay business tax in addition to bearing the unified tax. How can Chinese merchants compete with them? This is reason five for requesting exemption from business tax. (6) The Ministry of Finance has approved the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association's document (Fu Zi No. 5675) to exempt manufacturers who directly establish whole-sale businesses from business tax. The wholesale or distribution centers directly established by the associations and their respective industries are of the same nature and should be exempted from business tax by citing the precedent. This is reason six for requesting exemption from business tax. (7) The national tax law takes balance as its principle, and the national treasury and the people's livelihood should be considered together. If the associations are burdened with business tax again, it is not only double taxation and unequal treatment between Chinese and foreigners, but also hinders the people's livelihood. Therefore, we specially request prompt approval and a clear order to exempt the cotton textile manufacturing industry from business tax in order to relieve commercial hardship and comply with the law. This is truly in the public interest. We respectfully submit this document."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>A Telegram from All Employees of the Printing Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the Printing of Stamps</p>
<p>A telegram dispatched by fast mail from Jiang Wenzuo and others, representatives of all employees of the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau, states: The Shanghai Newspaper Association has forwarded to various newspaper offices for public consideration that the printing of stamps overseas involves numerous shady dealings. At a time when promoting domestic goods and safeguarding the people's livelihood is paramount, Lin and his ilk dare to covet kickbacks and openly collude with foreign merchants, desperately harming the state-run printing institutions. For seventeen years, we have relied on stamp printing for our livelihood, engraving countless varieties of stamps. In the past, when foreign advisors managed the postal service, there were never any unreasonable demands. Unexpectedly, after the recovery of postal sovereignty, such a scandalous act of forfeiting the stamp printing rights has occurred. The Printing Bureau is a steel-plate printing institution established by the state with an investment of several million. Even if the engraving is not perfect or the printing price is relatively high, the transportation authorities should make every effort to maintain it, especially considering that De La Rue's printing and plate costs are higher than those of the Printing Bureau. Moreover, the excellence of their engraving is debatable. Initially, colleagues, forced by livelihood concerns, swallowed their voices and repeatedly requested the transportation authorities to change course and voluntarily cancel the contract with De La Rue. However, the Ministry of Transportation and the Postal Service have attempted to gloss over and conceal their actions, claiming that the Sun Yat-sen memorial stamp, which will replace the junk boat-style general-purpose stamp, is already stipulated in the contract and must be printed by De La Rue. This limited quantity and term are merely for show. In reality, as long as China Post exists, the stamp printing rights will be held by foreigners, and the Printing Bureau and its employees will be plunged into eternal ruin. Having reviewed the reports in your esteemed newspapers, the officials from the Ministry [of Transportation] and the Postal Service have launched fierce attacks against the Printing Bureau. At first, they hid their identities, but recently, Li Jingcong, head of the Aviation Section, has recklessly voiced his opinions, obsequiously pandering to foreigners and overstepping his authority, acting shamelessly. There is a strong suspicion that he is colluding with Lin to commit fraud. He also claimed that the Printing Bureau should be maintained by the Ministry of Finance and should not insist on doing business with the Ministry of Transportation. It is unknown that the Printing Bureau's struggle for stamp printing rights is, in public, to protect national interests and, in private, to uphold the benefits of the contract. The Ministry of Transportation may not support the Printing Bureau, which is also a state organ, but it cannot stubbornly insist on maintaining the British-owned De La Rue Company. Colleagues are making this declaration out of desperation and earnestly request your association and your newspaper to uphold public opinion and immediately publish this declaration. Otherwise, remarks like those of Li Jingcong will lead the people to mistakenly believe that printing stamps overseas is a matter of course, and those who engage in private gain and fraud will escape punishment. The urgency of this telegram leaves us no room for further elaboration. Representatives of all employees of the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau, Jiang Wenzuo, etc., respectfully submit.</p>

<h3>Special Trade Union Law</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted for Discussion at the Congress</p>
<p>Representatives Appointed to Attend and State Opinions</p>
<p>The draft Special Trade Union Law, proposed by Hou Dachun and other representatives of the People's Congress and trade unions, has already been prepared with reasons and is ready to be submitted for discussion at the Congress. To enable the Congress representatives to better understand the reasons for the proposal, the Beijing and Shanghai postal workers' unions have also appointed Qi Jiamou, Zhao Shusheng, Wang Yisheng, Kong Fanzao, and other four representatives to petition the Presidium of the Congress to allow them to attend the Congress and state their opinions. The reasons for the trade union representatives' proposal and the postal workers' union's petition are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Representatives' Proposal: The draft Special Trade Union Law should be formulated and implemented as soon as possible. (Reasons) Since the pacification of the overall situation and the unification of the country, the Party affairs aspect has progressed from the military administration period to the political tutelage period, and the political aspect has progressed from the destruction period to the construction period. State-owned enterprises are waiting to be rebuilt, and rectification and construction are imminent. In the future, various undertakings will be undertaken together, and many staff and workers will be required. The staff and workers of state-owned enterprises are the state's workers and the cadres who build the country. The nature of state workers is fundamentally different from that of capitalists' workers. Capitalists use workers as tools to deprive them of the profits from their labor, while the state employs workers purely to develop the national economy and solve the problem of people's livelihood. The interests of state workers are completely consistent with those of the state, and the goals are the same. There is no so-called labor-capital dispute or conflict of interest. In other words, the interests of the state are the interests of the workers, and the growth and decline of the workers' own interests must be judged by the prosperity and decline of state-owned enterprises. All staff and workers in postal, telecommunications, road, mining, seamen, and inland waterway industries belong to the scope of state workers. At this time of political tutelage and construction, the need for workers is increasing, the power of workers is becoming thicker, and the possibility of workers being tempted by the Red Bandits or reactionaries is greater. Therefore, the organization and training of workers are even more urgent. However, since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law Implementation Regulations, special workers across the country, that is, state workers, have been limited to a state of dilemma. Those who have reorganized but have not fully complied with the law are because the law cannot be fully complied with. The qualifications of members mentioned in Articles 4 and 5 of the regulations are ambiguous and do not know what to do. However, fearing contempt of laws and regulations, they reorganized its name while fulfilling its essence. Those who respect the law and dare not reorganize are because the law cannot be violated slightly. The reorganization is by no means as simple as changing the names of the executive and supervisory committee members to directors and supervisors. However, fearing that the original organization would be eliminated after the reorganization, they temporarily did not reorganize. Since the nature and scope of state workers are completely different from those of capitalists' workers, the Trade Union Law is naturally difficult to apply. Therefore, a Special Trade Union Law should be issued as a guideline. The purpose of the Special Trade Union is to enhance the knowledge and skills of employees, develop production, maintain and improve labor conditions and life, and further seek the progress of the entire society and the happiness of all people. Its mission is to promote the Party's doctrines, programs, and policies to workers, expose the Red Bandits' conspiracy to deceive workers and destroy the Party, strengthen workers' belief in the Party, make workers understand that to solve their own suffering, they must pay attention to national interests, as well as the position and goals of effort during the period of political tutelage, and lead workers to fight for the Party. To achieve the above goals and complete the above missions, it is necessary to organize special trade unions as soon as possible, and the promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law is the most important plan today. Based on the above reasons, a draft of the Special Trade Union Law is specially prepared and submitted for discussion and implementation. Whether it is appropriate, please decide publicly. Attachment: A copy of the draft Special Trade Union Law. Proposer: Hou Dachun, Representative of the Shanghai Labor Circle.</p>
<p>(2) Postal Workers' Union Petition: Petition for permission to attend the National Congress to explain the reasons for the proposal. This time, the Central Government, following the instructions of the General Manager, convened the National Congress to open an unprecedented grand ceremony in our country and seek the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country. All national policies that have not been resolved in the past should be discussed and decided, and all groups that urgently need to be reorganized are also looking forward to having corresponding laws and regulations as their benchmarks. The Postal Workers' Union, together with the Telecommunications Road Mining Union, belong to the Special Trade Union. The General Manager stipulated it very clearly in the Trade Union Organization Regulations. Since its establishment, it has also had a considerable glorious history in the revolutionary process. The facts are all there, and there is no need to repeat them. However, since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, there are no applicable regulations for special trade unions, and the Special Trade Union Law has not been promulgated, making special trade unions across the country lose their basis and even causing unnecessary disputes. Therefore, the promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law is the urgent demand of more than 100,000 special workers across the country. In the past, the vocational associations have repeatedly suggested the draft Special Trade Union Law of 54 articles and submitted it to the Central Government for selection. At the opening of the National Congress, the Special Trade Union Law will be submitted for discussion by the trade union representatives. In order to enable the Congress to better understand the reasons for the proposal, the vocational associations have specially appointed Qi Jiamou, Zhao Shusheng, Wang Yisheng, Kong Fanzao, and other four people to attend the meeting and make a detailed statement to the Congress. We respectfully request permission to attend the meeting, and we are eagerly awaiting orders. Respectfully presented to the Presidium of the National Congress, Shanghai·Nanjing·Postal Workers' Union respectfully presents, May 11, 20th year.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>

<h3>Case of Japanese Ship Colliding with Hongqing Ship</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Municipal Government for Negotiation</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce presented a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: Regarding the petition, on the 9th of this month, a letter was received from Xu Tingzuo of Yili Company, stating that the Xinhongqing ship, which our company also manages, departed from the Renji Road Wharf at 2:50 p.m. on February 12 of this year and sailed upstream. While passing the Zhangjiabang Wharf, a steam whistle was suddenly heard from the port side. At that time, the captain saw the Longhua Maru sailing behind, about 150 feet away. He immediately opened the fast speed and replied with a whistle, and made the "Xinhongqing" try to lean to the right. Then the Longhua Maru sounded another whistle, and the Xinhongqing also reported a sound. At that time, the Xinhongqing leaned to the right, almost reaching the steamboats at the Nanjing Road Wharf, and there was no room for further concession. However, the Longhua Maru did not change its direction and still rushed over. The keel of its bow struck the center of the port side of the Xinhongqing, and was injured 30 degrees behind the ship's beam. At this time, the Longhua Maru sounded two steam whistles and left. Because the Xinhongqing was too badly damaged to sail, it had to be towed to a shallow place in the Suzhou River to avoid sinking. At that time, Xue Hongji came forward to report to the Water Police Bureau. The next morning, he reported to the Port Affairs Department and sent a representative of the Shi Dan Company to inform the Japan Mail Steamship Company. Up to now, many days have passed, and there has been no result. We also requested the Jianghai Customs Superintendent to approve a lawsuit to the competent authority according to law, resulting in a huge loss of more than 700 taels to the Xinhongqing. If this continues, the harm will be even more difficult to overcome. The Xinhongqing was sailing in front, and the Longhua Maru was chasing from behind. The Xinhongqing tried its best to lean to the right, but the speed of the Longhua Maru was fast, and it did not change its direction slightly. According to the provisions of Article 24 of the International Maritime Collision Avoidance Law, the Longhua Maru should be responsible for compensation. As for its disregard for our country's sovereignty and rampant illegal behavior in the inland river, it seems that the loss of the Xinhongqing ship is not the end of it. Since the lawsuit has been filed according to law, the Shi Dan Company's letter of request has been ignored, and the lawsuit has not been effective. For this reason, we are preparing a document and request your association to assist in claiming the loss, etc., to the meeting. It was found that in the previous Xin Daming case, the official assistance was used to deal with it without judicial procedures, which was slightly effective. In the Xin Kang case, the lawsuit procedures were used, and the case has not been resolved until now. Therefore, the request of this company for official assistance in the negotiation of this case without the lawsuit procedures is not without merit. It is reasonable to prepare a document and submit it to your government for review, and give a letter to the Japanese consul to transfer the negotiations for compensation, which is really convenient.</p>

<h3>Settlement of Collision Between Zhengda and Hanping Ships</h3>
<p>Both Parties Safeguard Friendship and Settle Peacefully</p>
<p>The Datong Zhengda ship and the Dada Hanping ship collided with each other in the Longjusha area of ​​the new port due to heavy fog. Both ships were damaged, with the Zhengda being the most serious. Datong sent a letter to Dada for serious negotiation. Yesterday at about 10 a.m., Yang Qingbang, representative of Dada, accompanied Zhang Shusheng, representative of Daqing Shipping, and Lin Tengfang, shipping director of Yicheng Company, to the wharf to inspect and discuss solutions with Mao Youren, manager of Datong. At the same time, they also requested Xinrui Rong·Jiangnan and other factories to check the damage to Zhengda in order to estimate the repair cost. Datong also asked the ship surveyor of the Mead Company to check and verify. Out of friendship and maintaining feelings, the two companies agreed that Dada would repair Zhengda first, and then negotiate a solution.</p>

<h3>Water Supply Expert</h3>
<p>Hill Telegram Confirms He Will Come to Shanghai Personally</p>
<p>Agrees to Come to Shanghai for Six Weeks</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reported that the Public Works Department has hired a water supply expert to investigate the Shanghai Water Supply Company. Since the Public Works Department continued to telegram New York expert Hill last Friday, asking him to come to Shanghai in person, it has now received Hill's reply, agreeing to stay in Shanghai for six weeks to conduct the investigation, with a salary of US$12,000 and all expenses covered. According to the Public Works Department, these conditions are acceptable, but it is contingent on Hill's personal visit.</p>
<h3>Change of Manager at HSBC Bank</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reported that Mr. Lawson, manager of HSBC Bank in this city, has been in the Far East for 29 years and in Shanghai for 10 years. He is now retiring due to poor health and will return to his country by Hakusan Maru tomorrow (12th) with his family. The position of Shanghai branch manager left by him will be succeeded by the deputy manager, Mr. Ting Shu Man, and the handover was completed today (11th).</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Should Issue Pre-Tax Notices</h3>
<p>Failure to Comply Clearly Shows Differential Treatment</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that the Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, regarding the Public Works Department Tax Office's collection of general tax (police tax), previously resolved by the association's congress and sent to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, stated that notices should be issued uniformly before each collection of police tax to avoid residents having to pay taxes in a hurry and being roared at by the bureau's officials. The latest news about the case is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's reply to the Taxpaying Association stated that its letter of April 20 regarding Wang Chiping's matter and its request to change the method of collecting house tax stated that the bureau had sufficient reasons to continue the current collection method. If Mr. Wang or representatives of your association are willing to visit the bureau's tax office, Mr. V. H. Bowm, the head of the office, will be very willing to explain everything in person. We reply accordingly, hoping you will take note.</p>
<p>The Taxpaying Association's second letter to the Public Works Department stated that it had received a reply on May 8 regarding the failure to comply with the matter of notifying 14 days before the tax collection, stating that there were reasons that could be conveyed in person by the head of the tax office. The investigation of the case was resolved by the representatives of the taxpayers and was the best manifestation of the elimination of differential treatment. Your bureau should implement it immediately. As for the sufficient reasons, this association is very willing for your bureau to report them concretely. As for the personal conversation, it is enough to cause misunderstandings and is not enough to show seriousness. It is difficult to comply. We hereby reply that, in addition to the fact that the bureau is still requested to immediately implement a written notification of the tax collection uniformly 14 days in advance, please check and quickly report the reasons.</p>

<p>Further Mediation Will Be Conducted</p>
<p>Regarding the case of China Merchants Group leasing the San Detang Jinliyuan Wharf, since the French Court stopped the execution of the judgment, this case has come to an end.

<h3>Statements from New and Old Medical Organizations</h3>
<p>How Should Hu Shuhua Handle This?</p>
<p>Physicians' Association: The Shanghai Physicians' Association recently sent representatives Pang Jingzhou to Beijing, carrying with them a proposal from the association. The proposal requested that the medical policy of the Party-State be clearly defined to benefit the nation and the people's livelihood. They also requested Hu Shuhua, as a representative of independent professional groups, to present it to the National Assembly. The original proposal of the association is recorded below: (Reason) The relationship between medical affairs and politics is already evident in the Rites of Zhou. The hygienization of politics and the socialization of medical affairs are new trends in the world. Our Party emphasizes the nation and the people's livelihood; the medical policy is of utmost importance and cannot be neglected. The old medicine in our country lacks a scientific basis and uses imperfect methods. People in the country advocate abandoning it, which is reasonable and well-founded. Even Japan once fully used traditional Chinese medicine, but understanding the trend, they resolutely reformed and achieved today's progress. In the third year of the Republic of China, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners requested the establishment of schools. The Ministry of Education stated that regarding medicine, they only aimed for complete academic studies and sought to align with the global trend of evolution. Only then could quarantine and hygiene policies be implemented smoothly. At that time, the State Council also had words of discouragement: "Branching out without reaching the goal, and doing nothing with doubts." This is a crucial point. The object of medicine is individuals in detail, but the people's livelihood and the nation as a whole in the large sense. It must be based on solid foundations and complete academic knowledge, capable of handling heavy responsibilities and reaching far, and paying attention to both small and large matters. Only then can it wave away all obstacles, protect the Party-State, and be free from empty interference. As for a momentary victory or excessive talk, even witchcraft and minor arts can sometimes be accidentally effective, but fearing to get bogged down by short-sighted gains, the gentleman does not pursue them. Recently, new and old medicine in the country have been in turmoil, and metaphysics and science are still in dispute. The public is confused about right and wrong, and politics is hesitating at crossroads. The education system is fundamentally shaken, and health policies are facing many obstacles. Superficial remedies are definitely not good news for the development of the Party-State, nor are they a sign of clear governance. The central government, upholding the late Premier's instructions, is convening the National Assembly. Can we sit idly by and watch such important issues go astray without careful research and a thought for resolution? It is believed that we should emphasize science and reject metaphysical talks. Why not take scientific medicine as the standard and define scientific medicine as national medicine, just as abolishing the lunar calendar and using the solar calendar as the national calendar? Several proposed methods are respectfully presented for high-minded consideration as to whether they are appropriate. If they are approved, it would not only be my honor, but also a practical benefit for the future of the Party-State. (Methods) (1) Actively develop medical education: A. Establish medical schools and hospitals extensively, using Comrade Dai Jitao's proposal and the newly issued orders of the Ministry of Education, and further consider the entrance requirements and duration of studies. Existing public and private medical schools must be fully maintained and brought into order. B. Increase research funding: National medical schools and departments should adequately increase research funding to allow professors to conduct extensive research. Developing creative abilities and enhancing academic reputation through research is of paramount importance and cannot be ignored. (2) Gradually eliminate traditional Chinese medicine: A. Imitate the Japanese method of assessing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, registering all traditional Chinese medicine practitioners nationwide once and allowing them to practice for life. B. Hire scientific doctors who are well-versed in the study of traditional Chinese medicine to organize traditional Chinese medicine techniques, hoping to eliminate falsehood and preserve the truth, preserving national heritage to promote the rationalization of medical care. (3) Encourage the manufacture of medical equipment and medicines: A. Medical equipment and medicines used in new medicine are products of scientific progress, and their remarkable effectiveness cannot be denied. From small items such as injection needles to large items such as X-rays, from crude items such as carbolic acid to refined items such as Salvarsan, efforts should be made to promote domestic manufacturing to achieve medical independence and reduce leakage. B. Research domestic medicines, hoping to promote national essence and expand its use in rational medical treatment, both to replace existing foreign goods, such as soapberry and platycodon which can replace Senega, and to supplement missing medicines, such as ephedrine and angelica extracts.</p>
<p>National Medicine Association: The Shanghai National Medicine Association telegraphed the National Assembly the night before last, saying: "To all representatives of the National Assembly in the capital, and forwarded to Mr. Hu Shuhua, regarding the Shanghai Physicians' Association's proposal to discuss and define the Party-State's medical policy, the proposed methods actually contain the profound intention of abolishing national medicine and promoting Western medicine. This is shocking to hear. Considering the rise and fall of national medicine is related to the nation's health and people's livelihood, medical organizations across the country have repeatedly listed reasons, submitted petitions, and received approval from the central government to promote it. The Physicians' Association's proposal not only disregards the national system, but also harms the foundation of the nation. Therefore, we specifically telegraph to your assembly to immediately reject it, and request Representative Hu not to propose it for the sake of the nation's health and people's livelihood." Shanghai National Medicine Association, bowing in reverence.</p>

<h3>Zhu Jixing Requests</h3>
<p>Transfer to a Chinese Prison</p>
<p>According to the Agreement on the Recovery of Concession Rights</p>
<p>Criminals Can Be Transferred to Mainland Prisons</p>
<p>The Magistrate Has Approved Zhu's Request</p>
<p>But the Police Force Disagrees and Has Filed an Appeal</p>
<p>Our country's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession rights and the agreements signed with relevant countries stipulate the places of imprisonment for criminals sentenced by the Special District Court. They do not necessarily have to be imprisoned in the Public Works Department's prison. If the judge believes that the criminal should be transferred to a Chinese prison in the mainland, the Public Works Department should also execute the judgment accordingly. However, since the establishment of the Special District Court, more than a year has passed, and no such case of transfer has occurred. Only yesterday did one occur, but it was not initiated by the judge but requested by the criminal. The criminal's name is Zhu Jixing, formerly a comprador at the Banque Franco-Asiatique, who was charged with embezzling more than 100,000 yuan last summer. He was detained by the Special Court and interrogated multiple times. In September, he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and sent to the Public Works Department's Tilanqiao Prison. After only a few months, he submitted two requests to the Special Court: one to be transferred to a Chinese prison in the mainland, and the other to have his sentence reduced. It is said that the reason he gave was that he felt very uncomfortable in the Western prison, so he made this request based on the provisions of the agreement signed by the Chinese and foreign committees on the recovery of rights. As for the reason for requesting a reduction in sentence, he claimed to be suffering from many diseases. Therefore, the Special Court, based on the petition, consulted the Public Works Department. Yesterday afternoon, the Public Works Department sent police officers to the Western prison to have Magistrate Cheng Shangfeng open a court to examine Zhu Jixing's proposal. However, the Public Works Department strongly disagreed with the criminal's request. The lawyer Zhang Dayin from the department's legal team appeared in court, stating objections. In general, he said that the criminal's claim of being physically uncomfortable in prison could not be considered a sufficient reason. After all, when a person commits a crime and is imprisoned, how can he be comfortable? Moreover, if this precedent is set, it is hard to guarantee that others will not follow suit. In that case, the litigation court would not see the flowers bloom, and the prison would have the sigh of grass growing. He requested that the criminal's request be rejected to maintain prison administration. Magistrate Cheng then questioned Zhu briefly. Since the agreement had clear provisions, the criminal's request was not without reason and should be approved. He then announced in court that he would wait to be transferred to a Chinese prison for execution of his sentence. The police lawyer immediately stated that he could not accept this ruling and would appeal to the higher court. He requested that the criminal still be detained in the original prison during the appeal period. Magistrate Cheng also granted the request and ordered the police to send Zhu back to prison. Whether he will be transferred to the mainland depends on the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<h3>East Xin Bridge</h3>
<p>A Man Was Assassinated</p>
<p>Neighbors Heard Two Gunshots</p>
<p>Discovered a Bloody Axe</p>
<p>At around 10:25 last night, a man was fatally shot and hacked with a pistol and axe by an enemy at the staircase at the back door of No. 27, Baoyu Lane, East Xin Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession. The reporter rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and witnessed the deceased lying face up in a pool of blood, head to the east and feet to the west, about thirty years old. He was wearing a dark blue floral wool jacket and long gown, with a white silk shirt and trousers underneath, white socks, satin shoes, and short hair combed back. There was a cut on the right corner of his forehead, about three inches long and more than an inch deep, with brain matter flowing out. There was also a knife wound about an inch long on his lower left jaw, but it was not fatal. A melon-rind cap was left on the ground, and the murderer had disappeared without a trace. The owner of No. 27 immediately reported to the Grand Zizhong Police Station. The police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. According to nearby residents, at around ten o'clock, they only heard an argument near the back door of No. 28 next door, but the sound was not very loud. Suddenly, they heard two gunshots. By the time the neighbors heard the noise and rushed out, the murderer was gone, and the deceased had already died on the spot. The detectives went to No. 28 to investigate and found a handleless axe with blood stains on the back doorway. Judging from the situation, the deceased probably fled into the lane first. When he reached the back door of No. 28, he was in a dead end and had no way to escape. He turned back to resist, but before he could say a few words, the enemy opened fire, followed by an axe. After being wounded, the deceased tried to escape, but fell to the ground in No. 27 due to his serious injuries and died. However, judging from the deceased's clothing, he was definitely not a formal businessman, and probably not a good person either. The cause of death was clearly a vendetta. The detectives investigated and immediately notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station and sent people to carry the body to the autopsy station to await examination.</p>
<h3>Degenerate Young Man</h3>
<p>Cohabiting with a Beggar</p>
<p>Doing Many Shameless Things</p>
<p>A True Annoyance to Parents</p>
<p>A Fujianese man named Qi, has resided at No. 866, Minhou Lane, Hardoon Road for years. His wife, Chen, has given birth to two daughters and a son, who have all successively entered school. The son, named Guoqing, is of tender age, but his character is extremely bad. At home, he steals money; at school, he steals objects. Family teachings and teacher admonishments, although extremely strict, ultimately fail to reform him. He is truly inferior to Jing Sheng. On the morning of the 14th of last month, taking advantage of his mother's deep sleep and unawareness, he stole 52 yuan in banknotes, held them in his pocket, and left. His parents still thought he had gone to school, but he did not return at night. When they inquired at the school, the principal told them that he had not come to school today, and they began to suspect that they did not know where he had gone. They reported to the police station for investigation, but at first, they did not know his whereabouts. In fact, after he stole the money and left home, he met a rogue who, seeing that he had a lot of money, seduced him with all sorts of tricks. From then on, they spent their days and nights together, and at night, they cohabited in an inn. In less than half a month, his money was exhausted, and the rogue abandoned him. Guoqing, having been away from home for a long time, feared being reprimanded by his parents upon returning, so he wandered outside, joining the ranks of beggars in the leper colony, begging for food. At the end of last month, while begging at the East Xin Bridge, a Jiangbei beggar named Zhang Asan, seeing that he had a beautiful face, took him as a comrade. During the day, they shared leftover food; at night, they slept together under the iron staircase of the old Tianchan Stage on Jiujiang Road. Every time the stars were slanting and the moon was setting, he would forcibly defile his posterior. After several nights, the matter was discovered by another beggar named Cai Ajin, who was greatly tempted. For the price of nine dimes, Zhang Asan formally transferred him. On the 4th of this month, he went to Cai and changed his residence to the Hongxing Inn on Beijing Road. However, these beggars were still not satisfied, and they ordered a person nicknamed "Little Ningbo" to go to Qi's house suddenly the day before yesterday, hoping to extort money. Qi Chen reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest them. Cai had already escaped, and only Guoqing was found and taken back to his mother to be disciplined. However, Zhang and Cai still thought of enticing Guoqing to join their gang. At seven o'clock that evening, they went to the Tiger Stove opposite Qi's house to drink tea, in order to take the opportunity to seduce him. Just then, Guoqing's sister, Yuying, went out to fetch water, saw the two beggars, ordered her brother to identify them, and immediately reported to the police, who arrested Zhang and Cai. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court, where Magistrate Ge interrogated them clearly and sentenced each of the two beggars to two years and six months of imprisonment. At the request of Qi Chen, Guoqing was sent to the Reformatory to learn a trade for one year, to be reformed.</p>
<h3>Wei Wenhua and Others</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Committed Three Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>In Addition to Lin Weiqing and Wang Zhenhuan</p>
<p>They Also Kidnapped Lu Mingsheng</p>
<p>Lu Mingsheng, a comprador at the Mediyang Company at No. 12, Huangpu Bund Road, was kidnapped by kidnappers on the night of February 12 when he was about to board his own car No. 62 after leaving the Yueli brothel on Guangxi Road. More than ten days later, he was redeemed by his family for a large sum of money, but he never reported it to the police station. Therefore, outsiders were unaware of this matter. Recently, the French Concession Police arrested two kidnappers, He Yugen and Chen Xingsheng. In addition to admitting that they had previously planned to kidnap Lin Weiqing and Wang Zhenhuan, the young master of Wang Yutai, and failed in both cases, they also admitted that they had kidnapped Lu Mingsheng. The French police believed that Lu's address was at No. 1325, Wuding Road, which belonged to the Public Concession, so they transferred the two bandits to the General Police Station to be sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. After the two bandits were extradited to the General Police Station, they further confessed that the location where they hid the hostage was No. 484, Fuli Road, French Concession. The day before yesterday, detective Wang Chengying specially went to investigate and found that the house was now empty. The owner said that it had previously been rented by a man named Zhang Renjie, but he did not know who Zhang was either. Later, according to the concierge of the area, the bandits living at No. 484 had moved to No. 184, Fugao Lane, Avenue Albert. When Wang went to investigate, they had moved again and their whereabouts were unknown. Later, after much inquiry, it was discovered that they had moved to No. 5 and No. 59, Kangjiaqiao, Chinese Territory, Jessfield Road. The police station in charge was coordinated and rushed there, detaining Wei Wenhua from Zhenjiang, his wife Dan, and Zhu Changtai from Anhui, Yu Bufang, Wang Haiqiu, Zhang Xiaoerzi, Yu Wen, Song Wang, Wang Gao, and other men and women, and confiscating two pistols, 24 bullets, and more than 180 yuan. Except for Wang Gao, who is still detained at the police station, the rest were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were also sent to the Special District Court. After Judge Xu interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained separately to await the arrival of all the suspects before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Is It Poison Powder?</h3>
<p>Western Doctors Say It Contains Heroin</p>
<p>Tang Jiren Claims It Is Malt Extract Powder</p>
<p>The French police received a report last month that a poison powder facility was set up at No. 3, Renshou Lane, Avenue Ennault, and therefore the police chief led detectives to confiscate more than 100 pounds of poison powder, along with manager Tang Jiren and hired associates Zhang Gengen, Gao Sikui, Wang Xiufang, Xu Yingjie, Zhao Qingyun, Yang Shuyun, Peng Xianglin, Feng Fuxiang, Wang Xiaodi, Liu Youfa, Liu Shanpei, Wu Jinshui, Chen Yuanxiang, and Jiang Asi, totaling more than ten people, and brought them to the police station. The case was sent to the French Public Court for interrogation and ordered to be chemically tested to verify the situation. This was reported earlier. They were summoned again yesterday. First, the Chief of Western Detectives reported the previous situation and stated that Western doctors had confirmed that the powder contained heroin and requested interrogation. Tang Jiren confessed that the powder was actually malt extract powder purchased from abroad by the store owner Wang Shimin for the purpose of making summer heat rash water. Now the store owner Wang Shimin has gone to Japan on business, and it is unknown when he will return to Shanghai. However, the merchant did not know whether the powder contained heroin. Zhang Gengen, Gao Sikui, and others stated that they only did odd jobs at No. 3 Renshou Lane and did not know about the poison powder. The Chinese and Western officials were dismissed to await consultation and the court's verdict.</p>
<h3>Aviation Society Welcomes British Aviator</h3>
<p>British aviator Ford (J.H. Ford) departed from London on March 23 this time and flew to China, arriving in China on April 28. The total flying time, excluding stopover days, was seventeen days, and the longest single flight was 650 miles. Last night, the Shanghai Aviation Society held a banquet at the rooftop garden of the HSBC Bank to welcome him. More than ten Chinese and foreign reporters attended. Leslie of the Asiatic Petroleum Company presided over the event. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, and the event ended at eleven o'clock.</p>
<h3>Case of American Soldier Killing Gu Jingen</h3>
<p>The Second Subdivision of the Third District Requests Negotiations</p>
<p>The Guominshe reported that the Second Subdivision of the Third District submitted a report to the Party Headquarters of the Third District yesterday regarding the case of Chinese worker Gu Jingen, who was shot and killed by an American sailor and Butler residing at No. 15, Fairweather Road, Broadway, on April 23. They requested that the report be forwarded to higher authorities for negotiations. The document stated briefly: "The American sailor and Butler had an argument with the repair workers Gu Jingen and others at the house. The sailor disregarded humanity and, over a minor dispute, dared to commit a brutal act by shooting and killing worker Gu Jingen. The sailor is using extraterritoriality as a shield and is still at large. The victim's family has no recourse. The United States claims to be a civilized country, and its soldiers and civilians should be governed by reason and justice. Now such an unfortunate incident has occurred, and the Chinese people are indignant. If this is tolerable, what is not? We request that the diplomatic authorities seriously lodge a protest to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderer and providing compensation to uphold the lives of Chinese people and emphasize humanitarianism."</p>
<h3>Confiscated 30,000 Yuan Worth of Narcotics</h3>
<p>No. 69 Guangdong Road</p>
<p>Ten People Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that on Sunday morning, the Public Concession Police confiscated a large quantity of narcotics at No. 69 Guangdong Road, including 400 ounces of morphine, one pound of cocaine, 480 ounces of opium, and other narcotics, estimated to be worth more than 30,000 yuan. Ten people were arrested on the spot and will be sent to the Special District Local Court for questioning on Monday.</p>
<h3>Dapu Road Car and Train Collide</h3>
<p>Both Damaged</p>
<p>At 5:35 PM the day before yesterday, the No. 33 night express train from Zhabei Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shanghai passed through the Dapu Road area of Jinrihui Port. It was around 10:30 PM at night when a car from Dongxing Automobile Company (Public Concession Permit No. 12415, Municipal Permit No. 956) on Avenue Edward VII, Dongxing Bridge, French Concession, driven by Lu Huixiang, carrying a passenger named Liu Zailin, an employee of the Jinrihui Port Transportation Company, was traveling from north to south. The train was traveling from west to east, heading to the South Station, resulting in the train and the car colliding at Dapu Road. The car's footboard got caught on the train's front iron plate, so the car was dragged by the train for about 20 to 30 feet, completely damaging the car's wheels and engine, which will require 600 to 700 yuan in repairs. The train's iron footplate was also slightly damaged. The passenger Liu Zailin was slightly injured. The road police at the scene took the driver Lu Huixiang to the South Station Police Station, interrogated him briefly, and then had the car company bail out the driver. The damaged car was towed back by the company for repair. The injured passenger Liu Zailin went to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is also heard that train and car collisions have occurred twice in the Dapu Road area, and the railway bureau must set up traffic light signals at that location to avoid danger and loss of life.</p>
<h3>Zhong Xiaoqi Sues Shen Meimei</h3>
<p>Sues for Defamation in Civil Court</p>
<p>Willing to Withdraw Criminal Charges Due to Persuasion</p>
<p>Zhong Xiaoqi, the owner of a Guangdong sock factory, was previously sued by Shen Meimei, a woman from Suzhou, and her mother in the Special District Court for charges such as enticement. Judge Wu Tingqi sentenced Zhong to one year of imprisonment. Zhong, dissatisfied with the original sentence, has appealed. It has been reported in this newspaper that recently, Shen Meimei, believing that Zhong's words during the last court inquiry, such as saying that she had worked as a prostitute at the Minle Lane Qingfeng Aiyue brothel, damaged her reputation, hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to sue him in the public court for defamation. The trial opened yesterday. The plaintiff stated that she had filed a separate lawsuit in the civil court regarding the damage caused by Zhong's actions and that she was willing to request the withdrawal of the criminal charges due to the persuasion of relatives and lawyers. The judge verified the confession and ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Chen Bosheng</h3>
<p>A Record of a Mentally Ill Man Kissing His Throat</p>
<p>Shen Bosheng (nicknamed "Pig Shrimp"), a local who runs the Yongchangshun Grocery Store in Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, is nearly sixty years old and has many children and grandchildren. He abandoned his comfortable family and sought trouble for himself. He has been living with his mistress, Wang Yang, in the store for twenty years. However, Bosheng recently suffered various stimuli, leading to mental disorder. At around one o'clock in the morning on the 26th of last month, he used a razor to stab himself in the throat, cutting his trachea. Wang Yang and others discovered this and sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. More than half a month has passed, and he is still not out of danger.</p>
<h3>Chen Axin</h3>
<p>Died in Less Than Ten Minutes of Illness</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chen Axin, a native of Pudong, about fifty years old, who was the head of the cleaning bureau in the French Concession, suddenly felt a severe headache while lining up boats at the Xin Kaihe Wharf. He immediately fell to the ground. His colleagues helped him onto a rickshaw and sent him home, where he died immediately. It took less than ten minutes from the onset of the illness to his death, which was very quick.</p>
<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law in Litigation</h3>
<p>The Daughter-in-Law Does Not Recognize Her Parents-in-Law</p>
<p>Refuses Her Husband's Request for Support</p>
<p>A local young woman named Xu Ding married Xu Zhilan's second son, Xiaofu, ten years ago. They originally lived together as a family, but later, because she was not accustomed to family education, she repeatedly encouraged her husband to separate and move out. At that time, Xiaofu was the manager of a certain firm and earned a good monthly income, which he provided for his wife to spend lavishly, and they lived peacefully. Recently, Xiaofu became disabled and stayed at home. Xu Ding, running out of money, quarreled all day long and often drove her husband out. On the one hand, she recognized her stepmother-in-law (Xu's stepwife) as a concubine and falsely accused her of abuse. On the other hand, she sued her father-in-law and husband in the local court, demanding 10,000 yuan in alimony. At that time, because Xu Zhilan was far away in Hong Kong and could not attend court, reconciliation failed. Recently, Xu Zhilan submitted reasons and appealed to the High Court, which is scheduled to open today.</p>

<h3>Domestically Produced</h3>
<p>Bailin Land Wine Selected for Singapore</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dikang Winery's secret recipe of "Nine-Nine Brand Bailin Land Wine" and "Xiaori Brand Ginseng Wheat Orchid Wine," dating back 200 years, were selected by the National Products Exhibition Hall affiliated with the Singapore Great World, the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, and the Singapore Nanyang National Products Company. Samples of the wine were sent for display, allowing overseas individuals to learn about the superior quality of the motherland's fine wine, sparking their desire to purchase and drink it. Yesterday, the distribution office of the Dikang Winery at 307 Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, sent the samples and a letter to Mr. Fan Qinwen, the representative of the Singapore Great World: "Respectfully, we have recently received the origin of the National Products Exhibition Hall affiliated with the Singapore Great World, forwarded by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting the shipment of our company's Bailin Land Wine for display. With the intention of promotion, your patriotic enthusiasm is deeply admired. Upon considering our country's wine, invented in the Xia Dynasty and flourishing in the Jin and Tang Dynasties, fragrant and mellow wines, jade-like nectar and fine wines, have long been perfect. However, as time goes on, those engaged in the industry have either lost the true tradition and are recklessly brewing, or are only profit-oriented, reducing raw materials, not seeking progress, and not paying attention to hygiene. As a result, imported products flood our country, taking over the rightful place, and the situation continues unabated. It is painful to speak of. Our company, in view of this, has gathered huge sums, hired famous masters, selected the red wheat of Central Plains, the fragrant rice of Zhengzhou, the red millet of Shanxi, the ginseng of Jilin, the red safflower of Tibet, and other authentic treasures to carefully brew this secret wine of our country from 200 years ago. It has many effects when consumed, the most prominent of which are expelling evil from the lungs, calming the qi in the liver, nourishing yin and tonifying the kidneys, eliminating food and dispelling diseases, strengthening tendons and invigorating blood, opening the stomach and strengthening the spleen, detoxifying and preventing epidemics. It is both fragrant and palatable, and greatly beneficial to health. Therefore, we present this secret brew to the world to compete with various countries, and the price is only one-third of that of imported products. Since its launch, it has long been praised throughout the country. Now that your institute has begun to display national products, our company has specially sent two types of wine: the Nine-Nine Brand Bailin Land Wine and the Xiaori Brand Ginseng Wheat Orchid Wine, respectfully requesting that you accept and display them for viewing, and widely publicize them, so that overseas compatriots can all try them, or gather together for celebrations, raising glasses and exchanging toasts, or presenting them to relatives and friends, making them beautiful and spectacular, so that the motherland's fine wine can from now on ascend to the elegant halls of foreign countries, and the situation can be reversed, which is also the reason for the recovery of rights. This is not only the good fortune of our company, but also the glory of the country. During your spare time, please do not hesitate to offer your valuable opinions on the advantages and disadvantages, so as to facilitate research. We are exceedingly pleased and hopeful. This is addressed to Mr. Fan Qinwen, Representative of the Singapore Great World."</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>National Assembly and National Education (1)</h3>
<p>Lu Shaoji</p>
<p>Education is of paramount importance in cultivating talent and researching academics, as it relates to politics and culture. In the past, Prussia rose vigorously, and Japan was able to leap forward, thanks to their efforts in education. Therefore, in today's world, the strength of a nation is invariably determined by the universality of its national education. In our country today, only about 30% of the people have received education. How can constitutionalism be promoted with such a lack of education? And how can we seek equality in international standing?</p>
<p>The National Assembly being held in the capital has a most important mission. In addition to solemnly accepting the principles and program of the Kuomintang of China in law on behalf of the entire nation to promote the unification and construction of China, it is also necessary to establish a provisional constitution that is jointly observed by the Party and the people within the scope of the Kuomintang's tutelage, and to establish grand plans for the long-term peace and stability of the country. I realize the importance of national education and also feel that the National Assembly is for the benefit of the entire nation. Therefore, I hereby offer my humble opinions for the reference of the delegates when discussing the "National Education" chapter of the provisional constitution.</p>
<p>(1) Universalize Compulsory Education: In all modern civilized countries, all citizens, once they reach school age, are required to study in elementary schools, as this is considered a duty that everyone should fulfill. The number of years varies from country to country, generally based on the economic capacity of the nation. Although China currently stipulates four years, it has been mentioned earlier that only 30% of the people receive compulsory education. Therefore, we should strictly adhere to the political program, "vigorously implement the popularization of education, and develop child-centered education with all our strength..." (Internal Policy Article 13) and seek the way to "strengthen the foundation and stabilize the country." The method can be to divide the province into school districts as a unit (first step), investigate the number of school-age children, (second step) consider local needs and train teachers, (third step) widely establish schools and add grades, (fourth step) consider national economy and educational needs and plan funding, (fifth step) the Ministry of Education shall formulate compulsory education laws and regulations to implement the popularization of education. The above only refers to primary education. Secondary and higher education should also be popularized.</p>
<p>(2) Vigorously Implement Mass Education: Those who have not received education in our country are mostly farmers, laborers, peddlers, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, artisans, tailors, apprentices, female workers, maids, waiters, cooks, boatmen, porters, rickshaw pullers, street cleaners, etc. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "To build a country with ignorant people is like building a tower on gravel, its foundation is not solid." Therefore, today, in addition to finding ways to "universalize compulsory education" for school-age children, we must also find ways to "vigorously implement mass education" for out-of-school youth and adults. The method can be to establish a "Mass Education Committee" in each county's education bureau to take charge of the matter. (3) Improve Women's Education: At present, women's education level in our country is still low and cannot stand on the same level as men. If we want to "grant women equal rights with men in all aspects of law, politics, economy, education, and society" (Kuomintang, recent policies), we should promote women's education: 1. Subsidies should be given to poor female students in elementary schools. 2. All schools from elementary to university should be open to both genders, but management must be strict. 3. In addition to opening all boys' schools, schools for girls at all levels should be established, such as girls' middle schools and girls' universities, so that those who cannot enter boys' schools also have the opportunity to receive secondary or higher education.</p>
<p>(4) Reward and Assist Poor Students: Someone recently calculated that those who receive secondary education in our country are less than one in a thousand of the entire population, and those who receive higher education are less than one in ten thousand. The reason for this is mostly that children from middle-class and lower families are trapped by family finances and have no ability to advance. Under this flag of blue sky and white sun, secondary and higher education must not be allowed to become the monopoly of wealthy families, and all young people in the country must have the opportunity to enjoy it. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "All young men and women in autonomous regions have the right to receive education. Tuition, books, and the clothing and food of students should be provided by the public. The grades of schools, from kindergarten to elementary school to middle school, should be ascended successively, up to university and beyond." (The Founding Strategy, the Law on the Implementation of Local Self-Government) Therefore, schools today should reward and assist poor students. Elementary schools should not charge tuition, meal fees, and book fees in principle. Free places should be established from senior elementary school to university. Scholarships or educational loans can be set up above secondary schools, so that students can repay after graduation. (5) Unite World Education: Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in his will, "I have devoted myself to the national revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China... We must awaken the people and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together..." If we want to achieve the status of "China's freedom and equality," we must "unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally," and we must also unite with educational institutions and educational experts from various countries so that they can express sympathy for the Three Principles of the People education implemented in our country. Because without their sympathy, the Three Principles of the People cannot be spread throughout the world and the ideal of world harmony cannot be realized. Today, our country should: (1) exchange educational books, newspapers, and papers with educational institutions and educational experts from various countries to spread the purpose and methods of the Three Principles of the People globally, (2) exchange teachers and subsidize students studying abroad, (3) use school textbooks to spread the correct national conditions and ideals of various countries, (4) establish international education colleges to connect world education, (5) designate a world goodwill association to specialize in international friendly matters to promote the popularization of the Three Principles of the People education and the realization of world harmony.

<h3>Guarantee Funding for Local Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Stipulates Fourteen Measures</p>
<p>| The Executive Yuan Orders All Provinces and Cities to Comply |</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the Ministry of Education to the Executive Yuan, guaranteeing education funding is one of the tenets of the Party's program and has been ordered by the government to be implemented. However, there are no specific measures, so provinces and cities cannot implement it. In recent years, local education groups have repeatedly reported that education funding cannot be guaranteed, resulting in the de facto stagnation of local education. In order to ensure guaranteed local education funding, fourteen measures have been formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for orders to all provinces and cities to comply with. The order was immediately approved, and the measures were copied and issued to all provincial and municipal governments for compliance yesterday. The order and measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Order of the Executive Yuan: For the purpose of ordering implementation, the Ministry of Education reported that guaranteeing education funding is one of the tenets of the Party's program and has been repeatedly ordered by your institute to be implemented by all provinces and cities. However, because specific measures have not been clearly defined, provinces and cities often cannot implement it. In recent years, local education groups have repeatedly reported that education funding cannot be organized and guaranteed, resulting in the de facto stagnation of local education. The reasons for the disputes and appeals to the Ministry are not uncommon. In order to ensure guaranteed local education funding, fourteen measures for guaranteeing local education funding have been formulated and submitted to your institute for orders to all provincial and municipal governments to comply with. Is this appropriate? Therefore, a report is submitted for review. After investigation, the measures proposed by the Ministry are for the purpose of ensuring guaranteed local education funding and should be implemented. In addition to ordering and distributing for compliance and reporting, the original attached measures are copied and issued for your government to comply with and forward for compliance. This order.</p>
<p>Guarantee Measures: (1) Provincial, municipal, and county governments should ensure the total amount of education funds as stipulated and not allow any shortages. (2) From the 20th year of the Republic of China, the provincial and municipal governments should determine the amount of any new local taxes to be retained as local education funds. (3) The local education administrative organs should organize and arrange the existing local education properties according to the following items: (A) The exact number of old funds and properties should be clearly investigated, accurately registered, and reported to the competent government for record. (B) For old land properties, if the land price has not been paid off, or the land has not been transferred or over-measured, the taxes should be paid up in accordance with the regulations to avoid disputes. (C) Old funds and properties in the custody of local landlords, gentry, and private individuals should be returned to the public for profit. (D) Old land property taxes, which were previously contracted by private individuals at low prices for profit, should be withdrawn, and tenants should be directly recruited and taxes should be collected to eliminate corruption. (E) Old funds and properties that have been seized by private individuals should be investigated and recovered. (4) The existing education funds must be used for education undertakings, and no one or any institution may borrow or transfer them for other purposes. (5) The percentage of local education funds in a certain unified tax shall never be reduced. When the amount of unified collection increases, the percentage of education funds should be increased proportionally.

<h3>Record of the Eastward Expedition of the Liangjiang Girls' School Basketball Team (3) (Written by Huang Jiping from Tokyo)</h3>
<p>22 to 20 Victory over Seikei 丨 25 to 15 Loss to Ichiko</p>
<p>丨 33 to 8 Victory over the YWCA 丨 Departing Japan today, Heading to Shenyang 丨</p>
<p>The Battle Against the Seikei Team</p>
<p>(Third Day, Tokyo Dispatch) After the Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team arrived in Japan, they achieved three consecutive victories. First, they won against Nagasaki Women's Normal School with a score of 19 to 10. Second, they defeated the Takehaya team of Tokyo Prefectural Second Higher Girls' School with a score of 20 to 15. Third, they triumphed over the Seikei team of Ochanomizu Women's University with a score of 22 to 20. The newspapers in Tokyo have been vigorously promoting this, naming it the Japan-China International Women's Basketball Tournament. Our students and overseas Chinese are overjoyed because Liangjiang's consecutive victories have brought honor to our country's women, and are unusually excited. I will briefly record the situation of the third match to inform the readers. The Seikei team, Liangjiang's opponent this time, also has a considerable standing in Tokyo. However, the players' heights are uneven, and their throwing is slightly inaccurate. Although there were some energetic players like Mochizuki Tetsuko, Takara Koko, and the incredibly skilled passer Miyanouchi Fumiko, as well as Kikuchi and others, they ultimately suffered setbacks midway and missed several opportunities, unable to reverse the trend. As a result, the difference was only two points, making Liangjiang's victory quite narrow. There were over a thousand spectators at the venue. Our country's students held national flags and shouted encouragement, contributing greatly. The Japanese side also applauded enthusiastically, creating a tremendous atmosphere. The two sides faced off, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. The referees were the Japanese Kurozawa and Dohei. After the game started at six o'clock, Liangjiang's Shao Jinying opened the scoring. Within two minutes, she shot another goal. Then, amidst intense scrambling, the ball fell into the hands of Long Jingxiong, who calmly shot from afar, scoring seven consecutive points. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Seikei desperately fought back and also scored several consecutive goals, resulting in a tie of seven to seven in the first half. At the start of the second half, spectators from both sides encouraged each other, and the applause was deafening, creating an intense atmosphere. Seikei's Fujimoto scored a point, and Liangjiang's Shao Jinying and Yang Ren each scored a goal, making it four to two. The result of the first half was eleven to nine. After a five-minute break, the second half began. Yang Ren scored two consecutive goals, and the entire team worked together. The third quarter was eight to six, and the last quarter was three to five. The total score was twenty-two to twenty, with Liangjiang claiming victory. The detailed scores are listed below: (Liangjiang Team) Position Fouls Score Shao Jinying Right Forward Four Six Tu Yunsheng Right Forward One Zero Yang Ren Left Forward Zero Eleven Long Jingxiong Center Two Five Zhuang Shuyu Right Forward Three Zero Wang Lan Left Forward Three Zero Total Thirteen Twenty-three (Seikei Team) Position Fouls Score Saito Right Forward Two Zero Fujimoto Right Forward One Two Takara Left Forward Zero Three Miyanouchi Center Two Five Tezuka Right Forward One Six Kikuchi Left Forward Zero Three Kawatsu Right Forward One One Total Seven Twenty</p>
<p>Defeat in the Match Against Ichiko</p>
<p>(Fourth Day, Tokyo Dispatch) The Liangjiang basketball team competed against the First Higher Girls' School of the Prefecture at six o'clock on the afternoon of the third. The location was in the school's gymnasium. The audience was very enthusiastic on that day, with eighteen being Japanese, especially students from the school. Liangjiang had already defeated Takehaya and Seikei in Tokyo and had an excellent reputation. The Japanese regarded the outcome of this match as a matter of honor and disgrace. Based on objective observations, we had already anticipated an unfavorable result. The opposing team was familiar with the venue, giving them a superior position. The Japanese spectators throughout the venue applauded and shouted, creating a tremendous atmosphere. The players of that team were known in Tokyo for their strong physique, quick running, and powerful strength. Liangjiang was tired from consecutive battles, while the opposing team was well-rested. Most regrettably, the referees Kurozawa and Ono were too biased. Due to the guest-host relationship, we could not argue. Knowing that the Japanese side had a do-or-die mentality, we had no choice but to tolerate it. The result was twenty-five to fifteen, with the victory going to the opposing team. In terms of the skills of both sides, each had its own strengths and weaknesses, without much difference. In terms of physical strength and running, the opposing team was better. Considering the personnel and geographical advantages, the opposing team had advantages everywhere. After the game, the Liangjiang players, with a sincere attitude, cheered to congratulate them, showing the spirit of the great Chinese nation and winning the praise of the Japanese. The scores of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Ichiko Team) Position Fouls Score (Liangjiang Team) Position Fouls Score Yamamoto Right Forward Twenty-four Shao Jinying Right Forward Two Six Misawa Right Forward Two Zero Yang Ren Right Forward Two Four Nagata Right Forward Three Two Tu Yunsheng Right Forward Zero One Suzuki Right Forward Zero Zero Long Jingxiong Center Four Four Yamagishi Center Two Four Hua Shuyu Left Forward Two Zero Yumin Left Forward Zero One Wang Lan Left Forward One Zero Sagoya Left Forward Zero Four Total Eleven Fifteen Total Nine Twenty-five</p>
<p>Situation of the Victory Against the YWCA Team</p>
<p>(Fifth Day, Tokyo Dispatch) The Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team competed against the Tokyo YWCA team at seven o'clock on the afternoon of the fourth. This was the last battle in Tokyo and the first time using women's rules. It was expected that there was an eighty percent chance of victory. The result of the match was a score of thirty-three to eight, with Liangjiang winning decisively against the YWCA. This battle took place in the YWCA gymnasium, with over a thousand spectators. The referee was the Western Ms. Hua. At 7:10, both sides formed their lineups. At the sound of the silver horn, the competition began. The Liangjiang players had already made up their minds to win, so their running and passing were especially agile. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of fourteen to five. The YWCA team's players were physically strong, but their skills were lacking. Every pass, whether long or short, was mostly unsuccessful. Liangjiang took advantage of this opportunity to bravely advance, causing the YWCA to be at a loss and fall into a state of collapse. The second half was nineteen to three, and the result was thirty-three to eight, with Liangjiang winning decisively. Shao Jinying showed off her skills, scoring fifteen points alone. Yang Ren also scored ten points. The detailed scores are listed below: Liangjiang Team Position Fouls Score YWCA Team Position Fouls Score Shao Jinying Right Forward Fifteen Shihara Right Forward Zero Five Tu Yunsheng Right Forward One Two Takawaki Left Forward Zero Three Xiang Dawei Left Forward Two Zero Tabon Left Forward One Zero Yang Ren Center Two Ten Tsumayoshi Center Zero Zero Zhuang Shuyu Right Forward Four Zero Nakamura Left Forward Zero Zero Long Jingxiong Right Forward Five Two Saka One Zero Wang Lan Right Forward One Four Nango Zero Zero Total Fifteen Thirty-three Total Two Eight From Tokyo to Osaka</p>
<p>The Xijiang team stayed in Tokyo for a total of seven days, winning three out of four battles and achieving a great victory. Due to urgent telegrams from Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, Kobe, and Korea, they immediately rushed to Yokohama after the farewell banquet held by the Asahi Shimbun on the evening of the fifth. They were greeted with a welcoming banquet by overseas Chinese merchants Cheng Oulin, Zheng Zongrong, Chen Dongting, Chen Tang, and Huang Xianchang on the sixth (Saturday).

Nishio Moriichi, head of the sports department, and Osakakakkyokai's Sawada Osamu and others were also present. The guests and hosts gave sincere speeches. The scheduled competition dates are as follows: Seventh against Osaka Women's Pharmaceutical College, Eighth against Kansai Women's Basketball Club, Ninth against Kyoto First Higher Girls' School, Tenth against Nara Higher Girls' School, Eleventh against Kobe Prefectural Higher Girls' School, and Twelfth to Shenyang and Dalian, etc.</p>

<h3>Two Diligent Women</h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>An old friend, Mr. Sun Lansun, returned to Shanghai from Beiping on the Ning Shao Wheel. He visited me yesterday. After exchanging greetings, he told me about two women he met on the boat. Their situation was very miserable, making people feel sorry for and admire them. Now, based on what he said, I will record it for the readers.</p>
<p>The two women met on the boat were from Jiangdu. One was surnamed Gan, around thirty years old. She was a beauty. Her husband was still selling candy in Xiannvzhen. The other was surnamed Yang, slightly younger. She was already a widow. The two were sworn sisters. They were originally skilled in paper-cut shoe flowers, which was the type of selling patterns commonly seen in the past. In recent years, women in the eastern reaches of the Yangtze River have all had natural feet. Fashion favors leather shoes and sneakers. Except for slippers and a small number of women's shoes with embroidered flower patterns on the toes, few others are interested. These women, influenced by the trend, could not make a living. So they changed their strategy and worked hard in other places, traveling to the Beiyang area. Unexpectedly, the trend spread a thousand miles a day, and it was the same as in the south, causing the art of paper-cutting to be greatly impacted. The two then discussed going abroad, vowing to embrace the spirit of great fearlessness. In the past year, they traveled, relying on two pairs of sharp scissors and four skillful hands, traveling and selling flower patterns. They even reached Moscow, Russia, as their final destination. Fortunately, nature creates people, with ebb and flow, and the cycle of life. What is abandoned here is taken there. Russian women, on the contrary, use embroidered shoes to show off their beauty, especially dancers. Gan and Yang were able to skillfully turn flower patterns, using scraps of paper to easily exchange for colorful banknotes, making a considerable profit, enough to keep them warm and fed. From then on, they settled down and were happy, not thinking of returning home. Unexpectedly, where there is profit, harm also follows. The Russian authorities believed that they had been there for many years, taking profit without giving benefit, and also eating bread for free, which they considered unsatisfactory. A month ago, they issued an expulsion order, forcing them to leave the country and putting them on the Siberian train, just like escorting them back to their hometown. While traveling, they also took out and confiscated a total of 500 yuan of their accumulated wealth. The two women had no choice but to beg for food on the train. When they arrived at the Manchuria border, they got off the train. At this point, they had to change to the South Manchuria train. But they had no money. After getting on the train, they were repeatedly beaten by wooden clogs. They were driven off at the stop, sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind. They waited for another train to pass and then sneaked onto the train again. They were discovered again and expelled. After nine such painful experiences, they finally managed to sneak across the border. After experiencing all kinds of hardships, they arrived in Hebei. When they were on the wheel, they poured out their experiences. Mr. Sun saw that their situation was not false and aroused a sense of compassion, advocating for helping each other in the same boat, and everyone donated to help. Moreover, they cut various flower patterns for three hours, dividing them among the passengers. Everyone was sympathetic to their plight. Even a small skill to make a living aroused the jealousy of foreigners. Those who heard about it sighed endlessly. However, their perseverance and courage are also admirable.</p>
<h3>Evening Chats by the Green Lamp</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>A cold spring night with rain, the small courtyard dimly lit. I often stay with my wife in our sickroom, relying on each other on one sickbed, like Vimalakirti in his square foot room, sharing zen. The only servant attending us is a hired woman. She came from afar because she was stranded in a foreign land at the end of the year in snowy weather. I pitied her for having no home to return to, so I temporarily allowed her to stay. She then babbled about the customs of her hometown, with many surprising stories, enough to break the silence and comfort my boredom. It is also a way to pass the time during illness.</p>
<p>The woman's home is near the Xiao River. The area is by the river. The village is a few miles away. There is a Yellow Mountain. The beast in the mountain is called a mountain dog. It is similar in shape to a regular dog, but more slender and taller. Its teeth protrude from its lips, and its appearance is terrifying. It is extremely fierce and likes to eat children. Therefore, the people at the foot of the mountain close their doors and live indoors before sunset. Usually, they warn their children not to go out easily. Strong men passing by the foot of the mountain must also travel in groups and carry paper umbrellas. Because mountain dogs are afraid of this object. Sometimes, when they meet, holding the umbrella and opening it towards them, they will run away in a frenzy. Therefore, pedestrians often prepare this as a talisman. One hot summer night, they couldn't sleep because of the heat. A couple took a daughter and placed a bamboo bed outside the door to sleep together. When they woke up, they lost their daughter. They cried out to the villagers to get up and look for her until dawn. They only found one of her legs in the field. It had already entered the belly of a mountain dog. Another family had a girl who cried non-stop. Her mother was angry and put her outside the door, saying she would offer her to the mountain dog. Actually, she was scaring her to stop her crying. After a while, she opened the door to look, but the child was gone. The mother was in great pain. The harm of mountain dogs is no less than that of tigers.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of human-faced badger that also likes to eat children. But it always takes dead children from the graves. However, it must give birth to them before eating them. It does not eat them if they are not born. Its method is to go to a newly buried grave at night, break the soil, and take the child out. It sits and holds it in its arms and cries. Its voice is wailing, just like a mother crying for her son. After a long time, the child is revived. Then it devours it. This principle is incomprehensible. The woman once had a relative whose child died at the age of three. The father was very sad. One night, he returned from outside and passed the place where the child was buried. He heard crying in the distance. He tiptoed to peek at it. It was a badger. He rushed forward and attacked it. The badger fled and the child lived. Overjoyed, he took him back. Now he is twelve years old. He often thinks of the badger's kindness for saving his life.</p>
<h3>New Words on Detective Techniques</h3>
<p>— Ai Jing</p>
<p>Detective work must rely on various specialized knowledge, such as physics, chemistry, psychology, behavioral science, and so on. Recently, chemistry seems to be particularly important. In France and Germany, there are many cases solved each year by test tubes. The French police even have a department dedicated to hiring chemists to investigate cases. Criminals can easily leave traces when committing crimes, such as fingerprints and footprints. They can often use gloves and overshoes to cover up the truth. However, according to chemists' research, what they cannot remove is dust. Recently, a theft occurred in a certain flour mill in France. One or two suspects were arrested. They did not admit to stealing. Finally, a small amount of earwax was taken from their ears and examined under a microscope and test tubes. It was found that the earwax was stained with a lot of powdery material. Its quality was the same as that of the mill. Also, their shoe covers, clothing, and pants were examined one by one. The powder stains were also layered. This was used to deduce the steps of the criminal action without error, and they confessed. Fingerprints and other things can be prevented, but certain types of dust float in the air and cannot be prevented from sticking to the body.</p>
<p>A specialized detective can learn about a person's race, appearance, nature, and even their occupation from a single hair left behind by a criminal. Regardless of the occupation, its environment has its own unique dust. Once it sticks to the hair, it is easy to know after examination.</p>
<p>Bloodstain examination is also very important. Human and animal blood are certainly different, and human blood can also be categorized. Examining the bloodstains at the scene of the crime and on the weapon left behind, and comparing them with the victim's blood, often helps to solve many cases.</p>
<p>Taking photos with X-rays, ultraviolet light, and other types of light can obtain various photos that cannot be taken with ordinary light. Various chemical drugs, such as tetraoxide thorium, can reveal hidden fingerprints. Potassium ferrocyanide can restore completely erased handwriting. Their contribution to detective studies is also not small.</p>

<h3>Travels in India (50)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>What kind of person is Gandhi? Dark-skinned, not tall, sixty years old, teeth missing and not replaced. He wears a coarse cloth shirt, basking in the sun to the east. I spoke with him for half an hour, briefly saying that he had been friends with Chinese people in South Africa. In the future, he should devote himself to the revival of Eastern culture and the salvation of the world. He wrote his name in Indian on my book as a sign. I copied a poem about Gandhi that I wrote in the past and gave it to him. Gandhi's attitude can be explained by citing Zhu Xi's description of his teacher. Zhu Xi called his teacher unadorned, like a farmer in the fields. Because Chinese learning is half farming and half reading, there is such an image. Although his personal life is extremely simple, the handling of organizations is equivalent to that of the government. Organization means it cannot be simple.</p>
<p>India now practices a chieftain system. Each large and small chieftain leads his people and joins the Gandhi supreme chieftain. Ordinary people have no ability or knowledge and regard the chieftains as sacred. Therefore, Allahabad has a leader newspaper, The Leader. My lectures in various places are often published in it. Gandhi's main academics are his major discoveries in psychology. He used gentle emotions to resist the strong, gaining the sympathy of the masses. The British also told me that his non-resistance movement was difficult to use force against. Because the soldiers' fighting spirit is down, if there is resistance, it can be attacked. Now, if you hit him on the left cheek, he gives you the right cheek. It is difficult to prosecute for using women and children in the movement. Moreover, the prisons are limited. Each county can only hold hundreds of people. Now, there are tens of millions of people everywhere. It is difficult to arrest them all. This is Gandhi's secret of psychology. But it is a hard work for a skilled worker. I think that although material things are developed now, the biggest changes in the world still belong to inventors in psychology. Recently, Wilson of America and Sun Zhongshan of China both deeply understand the psychology of the masses. Therefore, they created a new world. Lenin of Russia is the same. It does not depend entirely on a materialist view of history, but on the use of mass psychology. What Gandhi uses to move people is often fasting and crying. I see that his face is quite melancholy. He lives under the palm of his hand, fighting with flesh and blood against artillery fire. It is not easy to use a new sympathetic psychology. Alas, people all over the world express sympathy for the weak, which also shows the power of sympathetic psychology. From historical experience, male fighting, intelligence, and killing all fail. From the invention of sympathy and non-resistance by Tolstoy of Russia, to Gandhi's glorification and implementation, can sympathy psychology save the world if it evolves in the future?</p>

<h3>Hawthorne's Detective Case Turns a Corner (11)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>He said, "Brother Baoquan, I didn't expect to see you at this time. Bao Lang, what happened to you?" As he spoke, his eyes kept wandering over my face and body. I replied, "It's okay. I got an unexpected loot and became a temporary criminal again." Zhang Baoquan snatched the words again, "I am really a million times sorry for this matter. I will have to teach that fool a lesson. Please let me talk now." After he finished speaking, he hurriedly moved the chair and offered cigarettes. I told Hawthorne about what had just happened. Hawthorne listened intently to my report. The expression on his face became more serious as he listened. Finally, he exclaimed in surprise, "There's also a pearl necklace? Strange. Strange. But your guess is not close to the truth. I just came from the Gao family and asked about this question, but not only did your aunt not lose a necklace, but none of the other female guests did either." These words not only shattered my ideal but also shocked Zhang Baoquan into a daze. I asked suspiciously, "What? You just came from the Gao family? Have you been at the Gao family all along?" Hawthorne shook his head, "No. The inside story here is very convoluted. I encountered a strange thing." I asked in surprise, "Ah, how strange?" Hawthorne said, "At ten thirty, I received a call from Shi Jia at my residence, claiming that someone had called my residence for help with an urgent matter. So I quietly left the Gao family and rushed to my residence. Shi Gui had already recorded the address of the person who called. I didn't dare to delay and went to the address immediately. The location is No. 707 Datong Road, surnamed Guan. Bao Lang, do you know what this place is?" I thought for a while and replied, "That Datong Road is not very lively. No. 707 seems to be more to the west. It must be even quieter there." Hawthorne nodded, "Yes. How quiet do you think it is?" I said, "How can I imagine it?" Hawthorne glared his eyes and said, "That No. 707 is a funeral home, where the coffins of the Zhejiang and Shao Villagers' Association are kept. There is no one inside. I then thought of the surname "Guan," which is clearly a homophone for the word "ghost." That person actually wanted me to do ghost business."</p>

<h3>Gold Price Surges to 7 Taels</h3>
<p>Silver Price Meeting Likely to Fail</p>
<p>There is a possibility of a decline in large gold bars. Yesterday, the 11th, the price of gold soared even more, already exceeding 745 taels. The overall situation is peaceful, with a slight difference of no more than two cash in the market. Ultimately, the price rose by 7 taels. This is largely due to the declining silver market and rumors that the international meeting to maintain silver prices is unlikely to find a solution. As a result, the consensus among traders is solid. The price of gold opened high and then retreated slightly by two or three taels. The cash flow differed greatly among various firms, and the foreign exchange rate was nominally stable but secretly rising. As a result, the price of gold forged ahead, with the future market becoming increasingly sharp, once exceeding 47 taels. The evening market seemed to retreat slightly by two taels. It is said that large gold bars may see a price decline this morning.</p>
<p>The morning market showed vigorous growth. The June contract opened in the morning with a rise of three taels, reaching 741 taels and 5 mace. This was because the large gold bar price had fallen by 1/16 the day before, the silver price by 1/8, and private telegrams showed a decrease of 1/16. It then declined slightly by four or five mace, but Tong Taichang, Yuanheng, and others increased their purchases, and the price rose from 41 taels to 4 taels and a half. Then, Daxing, Yongyuan, Cheng Yongqian, Changxiang, and a Mr. Wu and others sold, reducing it slightly by one or two taels. As British gold remained stable, banks were making deals for August at 3125. Subsequently, June contracts were also traded at the same price, so the initial posted price was 43 taels. The listed price changed suddenly, calculated at 2 taels and 3 mace, then 3 taels and 2 or 3 mace. However, Wanxing, Yuanheng, and others were selling, especially HSBC, which sold July British gold at 3125, causing a further drop of more than 1 tael. At 10:30 AM, it was 41 taels and 7 or 8 mace. Afterwards, Tong Taichang, Chengfeng, Yongfu Chang, and others increased their purchases, with Taiwan buying Dalian gold at 1 tael, 5 mace, 8 fen, 8 li, 7 hao, 5 si, and Mitsui buying at 1 tael, 5 mace, 9 fen, 2 li, 5 hao. Moreover, British gold improved further, settling only at 25 to 3125. Furthermore, due to the failure of the silver market meeting, confidence was strong, and prices rose steadily. By 10:50 AM, it was 45 taels and 5 mace. Shortly after, it declined slightly by more than 1 tael, and at 11:00 AM it was 3 taels, 8 or 9 mace. Around 11:20 AM, it surged to 5 taels, 8 or 9 mace, as Xinhang, Yiyu, Bingxing, and others chased after purchases. Soon after, Shunli, Wanxing, Xinhang, and others sold, and it immediately fell by more than 1 tael, with 11:40 AM at 4 taels, 3 or 4 mace. Later, Chengfeng Yong Xinhang bought in. Nearing the noon closing, it was 6 taels and 2 mace, with fluctuations of 5 or 6 mace. By the time of closing, it was 6 taels and 1 mace, then raised again to 6 taels and a half. The quoted price remained at 777 taels, calculated to be down 34 or 5 mace to 31 taels.</p>
<p>A Slight Retreat Revealed at Closing. The afternoon market opened at 46 taels and 5 mace, followed by 7 taels and 3 mace, a remnant of the noon closing momentum. Subsequently, because Zhengjin sold July/August British gold at 25 to 3125, it retreated to 5 taels and 4 mace. Then it was heard that Indian exchange rates were down slightly by two annas, and Mitsui sold June British gold at 25, so it rose to 6 taels and 5 mace. However, there seemed to be more sellers on the trading floor, and by 2:45 PM it had dropped to 5 taels and 1 mace. Suddenly, Xinhang, Yuanmao Yong, Yiyu, Wanxing, and others bought in, and the price gradually rose by more than 2 taels, reaching 47 taels and 7 mace at 3:45 PM. Afterwards, Tong Taichang, Shunli, Hengxing, and others sold out, and it fell again by 2 taels, reaching 45 taels and 8 mace after 4:00 PM, plus another three or four mace. However, British gold was still stable, with settlements calculated at 25 to 3125. Additionally, there were no large transactions on the trading floor, mostly just showy gestures. Therefore, the closing price at 4:30 PM was 45 taels and 6 mace, with performance suppressed to around 5 taels. Compared to last Saturday, it was still up 7 taels and 1 mace (according to the posted price). The maximum price for the whole day was 47 taels and 7 mace, and the minimum price was 41 taels, a difference of 6 taels and 7 mace. Goods: morning market 2 taels, noon closing 6 taels and 4 mace, afternoon 6 taels and a half, closing market 4 taels and 8 mace. The quoted price was calculated to be down around 30 taels, recorded at 46 taels, replenishment water 44 taels, afternoon 44 taels.</p>
<p>Extremely Agile Transactions Various firms traded. Xinhang, Chengfeng Yong, Juchang, Yiyu, and Sen Changyong all increased their holdings. Wanxing, Shunli, Tong Taichang, Yuanmao Yong, Taixing Yong, and Qian Changxiang all sold out. Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yongfeng, Yiwu Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanda, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanda Yong, Futaiheng, Shenkang, and Yuankangxiang all had considerable trading activity. The exchange rate arbitrage were all sold out. In the afternoon, Xinhang, Yiyu, and Yuankangxiang all increased their holdings. Wanxing and Yuanmao Yong had unequal entries and exits. Yuanheng, Shunli, Daxing Yong, Yuanxing Yong, and Hengxing all sold out. The Dalian group sold over 2,500 large bars and bought 500-600 bars. The Guangdong group sold 200+ bars, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Nominally Stable, Secretly Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC posted exchange rates only showed Hong Kong decreasing by 0.125, calculated at 78.625 taels, and Singapore increasing by 0.025, calculated at 183.75 taels. The rest remained unchanged. However, the silver market had slightly declined the day before, and American and British exchange rates also decreased. The market shows a potential minor decline, so there seems to be no solution to rescuing the silver market. As for the Shanghai market exchange rate, the domestic board seemed advantageous, and the gold market broke through the 740-tael mark again. British gold arbitrage was lower than last week, only 16-17 taels away, so it was still profitable for gold companies. They purchased actively, such as Runchang Yufuchang Yongtai, etc. Banks were still eager to sell. About 300,000-400,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Also, Bombay sent a telegram in the afternoon to sell, and American gold was bought by the Guangdong group, Shengda, etc., sold by British and Japanese banks. Various banks also traded, totaling about 300,000-400,000 yuan in transactions. Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian group to Japanese commercial banks, totaling about 1 million yuan. The market situation seemed tense. The result, compared to last Saturday, was that British gold shrank by 0.121, American gold by 0.025, and Japanese gold rose by 0.0125. British exchange domestic board was mostly stable throughout the day, with only 0.0625 fluctuation. In the morning, the bid price was 1 shilling 3 pence 3125, and the asking price was 375. Shanghai Hua Bi sold June 3125 (Runchang Yu bought). Taiwan Zhongfu and Shanghai Zhongfu traded mutually for August, all at 3125. At 9:30, HSBC Shanghai Hefeng offered July at the same price (Fuchang bought), Mitsui Zhejiang offered June at the same price, and East Asia offered the same price (Yongtai bought). After 10:00, Maihang Mitsui sold to Citibank this month at 3125. At 10:45, Maihang Zhengjin offered July/August at 25 to 3125. At 11:00, Shanghai offered July/August, and Maihang offered May/June, both at 25 to 3125. The noon closing bid price was 25 to 3125, and the asking price was 375.

Sumitomo offered June at 31 yuan in the morning, and HSBC and Hua Bi traded mutually at the same price. At 10:00, Zhejiang bought in at 31.0625 yuan (Yongtai sold).

In the afternoon, Meifeng and Hua Bi traded mutually for July at 30.09375 yuan. The closing bid price was 30.0875 yuan, and the asking price was 31 yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese exchange domestic board fluctuated around 0.075 from morning to night. The morning bid price was 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 2 li 5 hao, and the asking price was 1 tael 5 mace 8 fen 5 hao. Mitsui offered June at 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 5 hao in the morning and also bought existing Dalian at 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 2 li 5 hao. Mitsui bought this month at 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 2 li 5 hao at 10:45. Taiwan bought at 1 tael 5 mace 8 fen 8 li 7 hao 5 si. The noon closing bid price was 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 7 li 5 hao, and the asking price was 9 fen 2 li 5 hao.

<h3>The Deteriorating Interest Rate Market</h3>
<p>Last week, the foreign market was agitated by the bullish side, and they unloaded heavily. Banks, seeing the deteriorating situation, did not dare to absorb it, resulting in a strong selling atmosphere and a large drop in interest rates, with a difference of up to 0.06, which can be said to be a drastic change in the market atmosphere. However, judging from the current situation, a poor cocoon harvest this year is expected, and the tea season is already a thing of the past. Checking the results, it is very weak. Therefore, the subsequent interest rate market really has no good news to report. The course of the Divergent Interest Rate Discount (Foreign Interest Rate). Yesterday's market situation: the foreign interest rate fell again by 0.005 to the tune of 0.0625. The morning market was 7 mace 2 fen 6 li and a half, and the afternoon market was 7 mace 2 fen 6 li 6 hao 2 si and a half. Although the situation was better in the afternoon market, its momentum was still difficult to achieve victory. (Silver Discount). Yesterday, the silver discount was slightly stronger. Both the morning and afternoon markets were 0.04, which was better than the white loan market situation the day before. There was also a market of two or three for adding water and spreading.</p>
<p>Among auxiliary coins, steel dollars continued to rise, and Jiangnan small foreign coins continued to fall. The morning market was 6 mace 5 fen 3 li, and the afternoon market was 6 mace 5 fen, down slightly by 0.0035 from the day before. Trading: 4,500 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 mace 4 fen 4 li and a half in the morning market, and 6 mace 4 fen 4 li in the afternoon market, down 0.0015 from the previous afternoon. Trading: 100,050 jiao in the morning market and 7,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 1,000 more, totaling 382,500 wen.</p>

<p>Securities Government Bonds Suffer Renewed Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, various government bond spot goods were opened, but transactions were still sporadic. Futures trading continued to be extremely lively, because bond prices suddenly became fatigued again. In the first round of the morning, the market situation was still good. Although there were many sellers, buyers still occupied the advantage. The market prices of various bonds rose slightly compared to last Friday. The second round gradually declined, but the trend was still peaceful. In the later market, selling transactions became more active and occupied the dominant position in the market. The price declined and turned vigorously, gradually becoming fatigued. Until the closing, the trend was still very fatigued, because it was reported in the market that there would be some changes in finance. As a result, 19 Good and 20 Vol. fell by a little over two yuan and several corners, and others also fell by about 1.67 yuan. The total turnover of spot goods was 18,000 yuan, and the total futures was 23,400,000.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton The Yarn Market Is Unsettled Again</p>
<p>Rumors abound... Heavy selling pressure causes the yarn market to weaken, and the decline is more intense. Coupled with rumors about the current situation, people's hearts are shaken, and new sellers flock in. At the same time, third-grade yarn is also declining, which makes people feel more depressed and the selling wind stronger. However, a certain large merchant is still mainly receiving goods this month, while retail investors have an unusually strong intention to short. As soon as the market rises, sellers flock in. The sales of spot yarn are still good. Currently, the yarn market is still wavering.</p>
<p>The Person-Yarn standard fell by more than 2 taels. In the previous market of the Exchange Person-Yarn standard, the slight increase in American cotton and the rise in Indian cotton made people's hearts firm, and each rose by 0.02-0.03. Then, in the second and third rounds, it turned down. The telegram from third-grade yarn showed a downward trend, and the selling pressure was strong again. Each fell by 0.04-0.06 to 1.2 taels. The afternoon decline was even more severe due to frequent rumors about the current situation, and the situation was very bad. Each fell by 1.5 taels. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 31,700 bales. It was found that Deji sold 1,100 bales, Heshen 900 bales, Zhenda 900 bales, Shenxin 800 bales, and Changfeng 700 bales. Qialong bought 1,450 bales, Changji 750 bales, Yichang 950 bales, and Yiyu 2,400 bales. The closing prices of the Person-Yarn standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The trend of spot yarn is still smooth. The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that all the groups bought a total of 1,800 bales throughout the day. Among peers, 300 bales were bought in. The market started firm and then became stable. Among the guest groups, Tianjin bought 400 bales, Sichuan 60 bales, Changsha 120 bales, North Group 50 bales, Inland 310 bales, Shantou 210 bales, Hong Kong 125 bales, Jiangxi 60 bales, Qinhuangdao 25 bales, and Miscellaneous Group 110 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton is Softened by the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell. Overseas cotton markets are stable, and people's hearts are still calm in the local market. Japanese merchants are still firm and refuse to let go of the goods they have pulled in, because the underlying goods are too dry. However, the sales of spot cotton are sluggish, the intentions of various factories are very slack, and the yarn market is weak again, causing the cotton market to soften a bit. The Han-Yarn Standard starts rising then declines. In the previous market of the Exchange Han-Yarn Standard, the rise in Indian cotton made people feel tight, and each month rose by 0.03-0.04. In the second and third rounds, it fell due to the slump in the yarn market. As a result, each rose by 0.005-0.02. In the afternoon, following the large fall in the yarn market, each month fell again by 0.015-0.04. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 82,100 dan. It was found that Tianlong sold 3,700 dan, Shenchang 2,100 dan, Yongfeng 2,000 dan, and Yuanda 1,900 dan. Changfeng bought 3,800 dan, Gengfeng 7,200 dan, Yiyu 3,700 dan, and Tongxing 3,200 dan.

<p>The need for spot cotton factories is silent. There are no transactions in spot cotton. Only 450 bales of Yao cotton arrived.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Third-Grade Cotton Yarn is More Severe</h3>
<p>The Osaka third-grade cotton futures market prices yesterday are recorded as follows: Closing Compared to Previous Day August 32.40 Down 0.35 May 31.10 Down 0.55 September 32.55 0.50 June 31.15 0.65 October 32.55 0.55 July 32.20 0.35 November 32.65 0.70</p>
<p>The Osaka third-grade yarn futures market prices yesterday are recorded as follows: Closing Compared to Previous Day August 128.10 Down 2.90 May 131.60 Down 2.30 September 126.80 2.60 June 129.70 2.40 October 124.80 2.60 July 229.10 2.30 November 124.00 3.10 Also, the Osaka spot yarn telegram: 20-count Blue Fish 139 yuan, unchanged, equivalent to Shanghai standard 224 taels and 1 mace. 20-count Red Fortune God 135 yuan, down 1 yuan, equivalent to Shanghai standard 217 taels and 8 mace. 16-count Fukushima 127 yuan, down 1 yuan, equivalent to Shanghai standard 204 taels and 8 mace. 16-count Three Horses 127 yuan, down 1 yuan, equivalent to Shanghai standard 204 taels and 8 mace.</p>
<p>Grain Guest Sen Rice Price Up 2 Corners North Group Sets Out to Handle Guest Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of guest sen rice was sharp, because the amount arriving from the lower reaches of the river decreased, and there were wholesale households buying, so the price was difficult to buy. Therefore, this street is paying attention to guest sen rice. Since guest sen rice is being sought by various households on this street, the market has changed suddenly. The North Foreign Group is again searching for guest dollars in the market, which is even better for the people. Jiangxi Ji Wan and other guest sen rice immediately jumped up by about 2 corners, and the transaction volume also increased. A total of more than 2,000 packages of Jiangxi Ji Wan were opened throughout the day, priced at 11.44 yuan, 11 yuan, and 10.95 yuan. More than 200 packages of Jiangxi Ji Zao, priced at 10.72 yuan. 500 packages of Nanjing machine rice, priced at 11.15 to 11 yuan, were all handled by this street. The North Foreign Group went to Jiangxi to handle 100 packages of Ji Yuan, priced at 14.3 yuan, which was also nearly a corner higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Bean Flour Market Boils in the Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean flour market showed a good picture in various months. Although the price of foreign wheat only limited Canada to 0.02-0.03, and Chicago had little in and out, due to the heavy rain the night before and no clearing yesterday, and the weather was very cold, the general idea was that if the long rain continued, it would have an impact on the new wheat harvest. Therefore, after the market opened, the market in various months was seen to be soaring, especially the far months. The highest in October was over 2.09. Later, because the actual sales of this month were not moving, and the market atmosphere was ordinary, it gradually fell. If the rain does not stop, people inside and outside the industry may have to be frenzied again. As a result, this month was 0.01 better than the previous weekend, June was 0.015 better, July was 0.02 better, August/September was 0.0175 better, and October was 0.02 better.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market Thrives with Excessive Rainfall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market in various months was seen to be surging. Because the current stock is still smooth, people's hearts can still be calmed down this month. In the far months, the rain was very heavy and there was no sign of clearing. Although it is not the harvest season, it will inevitably be slightly damaged due to excessive rainfall, because this year's foothold is not very good. If the harvest news is bad again, people's hearts will easily be impulsive. Therefore, from the opening to the closing, the market in the far months has always been strong. To observe the rise and fall of the next step, it should be shifted with the weather. As a result, this month rose by 0.03 compared to the previous week, June/July rose by 0.07, and September/October rose by 0.06.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Sales Still Have No Turn for the Better Overseas Japanese silk market prices are cheap, and sales in Chinese silk factories still have no turn for the better. Although there was a factory manager telegram from New York yesterday, the price was still small and the transaction was sparse. Yesterday, Qianli and others bought 60 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Xiangji and others bought 14 packages of coarse yellow silk, and the prices were generally fatigued.</p>
<h3>Silk Famine Discovered in Chang'an</h3>
<p>Silkworms are all discarded in the heavy rain of the 5th and 6th of the lunar month. In recent years, sericulture in the Chang'an area has become more and more developed. Although most of the early silkworms raised by farmers this year are improved breeds, the weather is as cold as winter, and there are few sunny days and many cloudy days. Many silkworms have white muscardine, and late silkworms also have cold and rainy weather, making feeding very difficult. After supporting it to the big sleep, the heavy rain continued for days on the 5th and 6th of the lunar month. The silkworms in the lush leaves all ate the damp leaves, vomiting black foam and diarrhea yellow water, and almost all of them were discarded. The disaster of the silkworm famine has become a reality, and the silkworm farmers have suffered a lot of losses.</p>
<h3>Most of the Hangzhou Cocoon Business Has Not Been Leased Out</h3>
<p>This year, the foreign silk market has fallen sharply, and silk merchants have suffered heavy losses. They all hold expectations for the upcoming cocoon harvest this year. The silk shops in the Gongchen Bridge area of Hangzhou were already leased out at this time in previous years. This year, only 40-50% have been leased out. Currently, the silkworms in the Hangzhou area have been largely discarded due to the impact of cold and rain, and silkworm diseases have occurred. It is difficult to expect a good silkworm harvest. Therefore, fewer and fewer people ask about the cocoon business, so there are few people who pay fees.</p>
<h3>The European Sales of the New Native Green Tea Continue to be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market of this port, Yingzhuang, Tongfu, Xiehe, and other companies spared no expense in searching and buying green tea from Sui'an Huzhou and other places made by local tea factories, for the sake of preempting the new products. Because today the British Company's ship exports them for shipment. However, there were not many goods produced by the tea factories in the market yesterday, and only a hundred or so boxes were traded. However, the selling price has been raised to over a hundred taels, which is due to the urgent need of foreign merchants to load ships. The market may be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>The New Sample of Qimen Black Tea Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhongxin Chang, Yongxinglong and other tea warehouses had already received new samples of Qimen black tea. The fragrance, manufacturing method, and leaf bottom are all good. Once the large pile arrives in Shanghai, it will be officially released.</p>
<p>Piece Goods The Miserable Fall of Foreign Yarn Has Not Ended</p>
<p>The local fabric market is not very good or bad, and actual sales are still smooth. However, 9-pound cloth rose again yesterday due to the scarcity of spot goods. Cat Ying and Wufu both opened at 5 taels, and Jubao Pen at 4 taels and 8 mace and a half. Flying Bear and Taurus of 13 pounds are also firm. Yesterday, they all opened at 6 taels and 2 mace. Wentaizhou and Ningbo and other groups have each made purchases. Fine cloth has presented a stable situation. Blue Chicken is 7 taels and 1 mace and a half, Color Ball 7 taels and 4 mace and 2.5, Yang He 7 taels and 4 mace and 7.5, Fine Twill Blue Double Fish is still 7 taels and 3 mace and a half, Yang He 7 taels and 4 mace and 2.5, and Yihuo Tiao Piao is still strong, opening at 8 taels and 6 mace. Spot goods are still scarce. Coarse twill is quite lonely.</p>
<p>The market situation of Dongxi Piece Goods has been stable for several days, but the decline of foreign yarn is quite fierce among all goods. Because the weather is not hot and there is no vitality in sales, and those who arrived earlier are about to expire, so it is gradually falling. Yesterday, Dian Qiuxiang has fallen to 10 taels and 0.025, Xiao Meiren 12 taels and 0.05, and Yipin Fugui and Hanshan Temple and other brands have also fallen one after another. There are still many stocks in Shanghai, so it is difficult to turn around in a short time. The fall of Bai Zhou cloth has stopped. The Stripe Fu Silk has a tendency to become higher and higher. Jianlai Tu sells for 4 mace and 0.005, Qing Guan Jing for 4 mace, and has risen by another 0.005. There have been slight transactions in Printed Linen Gauze and Printed Colored Ting in this street, and the prices are still stable. Among Western goods, Fu Silk is the most popular, rising by about 0.01.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Prices of Thick and Thin Raincoat Cloth</h3>
<p>Thick "Single-Sided Open Water Beauty" is traded daily on this street, but its market price has been declining due to large inventories arriving one after another. Yesterday, brands such as Rong, Rongtai, Haohua, Hongsheng, and Zhengchang Xinji all dropped in price to five taels. Even when selling whole boxes with marked tickets, there was still room for further price reductions. "Thin Elephant Skin Raincoat Cloth" is extremely scarce in the market, and selling prices are quite firm. Blue is particularly tight and prices have risen. Yesterday, Zhengchang, Xinji, Rongtai, and Taihe goods all rose to three taels and two mace and five candareens. When purchasing by the bolt and matching colors, the price increases by one candareen per yard. Those wanting to buy bald blue cloth will find it difficult to obtain without a clean offer of three taels and five mace, as the stock of bald blue thin raincoat cloth at sea is indeed very limited.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Gradually Rise in Price. Black melon seeds have recently experienced active sales from various merchant groups, and market prices have gradually risen. Yesterday, a batch of processed goods, totaling one hundred packages, was offered by a merchant group, priced at thirteen taels, with remaining quantities. They were unwilling to sell for less than thirteen and a half taels, indicating a tight trend. Ordinary grades were priced at twelve and a half to twelve taels, and Xu Kui seeds at sixty-two taels, both rising by about two taels compared to previous market prices. It is observed that merchant holdings are generally low, and the market may tighten further.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Initially Falls, Then Firms Up. Yesterday's sugar market saw quiet buying interest in He Sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at the public exchange. Offered prices remained similar to previous levels. Subsequently, small-scale hoarders eager to sell caused transaction prices to fall to ten taels and four candareens, with about two hundred bags changing hands. Later, as buyers gradually showed more interest, prices rose to ten taels and four candareens and a half, slightly stabilizing the market. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at ten taels, and No. 10 He red sugar at nine taels, with scattered transactions. Japanese sugar saw quite active trading: N mark at ten taels and six candareens, SH mark at ten taels and one candareen, TX mark at ten taels, eight candareens, and two and a half leas; TM mark at ten taels, one candareen, and two and a half leas; YT mark at ten taels and five candareens; YRO mark at nine taels, nine candareens, five to seven and a half leas; YP mark at ten taels and nine candareens; and Minghua goods at ten taels, eight candareens, and seven and a half leas, indicating a firm and brisk market. The exchange price for domestic Huanggang Qing brand was seven taels and nine candareens, but there were no transactions. The local factory offered over two hundred bags of ice flower green sugar yesterday, priced at nine taels and three candareens and a half, for delivery in two weeks, which is a rise of one candareen compared to previous offers, showing a very promising market with signs of further price increases.</p>
<p>Metals: Eastern White Iron Prices Rise Again. Although Eastern white iron trading has not been very smooth recently, inventories are very low, and sentiment is good, pushing standard prices to as high as one tael and five cents (six feet) and one tael and two mace and five cents (seven feet). However, yesterday's rise in Eastern exchange rates led to a buying frenzy, pushing standard prices up by another two cents, with six-foot sheets selling for one tael and seven cents each and ten-foot sheets for one tael and two mace and seven cents. Retail sales at shops and deliveries from the main warehouses would require an additional one cent increase in price. Judging by recent Japanese prices, they will need to be increased by another one or two cents.</p>
<h3>Huisi Iron Arrives, Over a Thousand Boxes.</h3>
<p>Huisi iron, with its low inventory levels, has seen its standard price skyrocket to over thirty-five taels. However, general users, fearing that prices are too high, are hesitant to act, so they are all waiting. Yesterday, the Shanghai Pudong Tongchunfu warehouse received only one thousand three to four hundred boxes of new goods, which is still insufficient for the current market demand, disappointing users and suggesting prices may rise further.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 42,000 packages of soybeans shipped to Europe; 7,600 bags of flour shipped to Shantou; 2,300 packages of raw peanuts shipped to Guangdong; 470 pieces of native cloth shipped to Nanyang; 530 cases of foreign wine shipped from France; 1,400 boxes of milk shipped from England to Shanghai; 440 pieces of telephone materials and machinery shipped from England to Shanghai; 144 pieces of wild silk and silk waste shipped from Yantai and Qingdao to Shanghai; 3,000 barrels of cement shipped from Dalian to Shanghai; over 300 pieces of Hu silk shipped to the United States; 258 large silver bars shipped from the United States.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from a Trip North</h3>
<p>— Anping</p>
<p>Fourteen: Snippets of Yanjing (Part 1)</p>
<p>There are quite a few universities in Beiping. Some of the better ones include Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Peking University, which we all know, as well as Fu Jen Catholic University, which is also quite famous locally.</p>
<p>Of these universities, I am most familiar with Yenching University, followed by Tsinghua University. There are many students in the South who dream of going to Yenching, but while everyone knows quite a bit about Tsinghua, they don't know Yenching in as much detail. Since I am comparatively familiar with this school, I would like to write a little more about it here.</p>
<p>Let me first tell you about all the material aspects of Yenching.</p>
<p>Speaking of the campus scenery, I think that among the universities in China, Soochow University stands out as the best. It is said that Soochow University in China is second only to the best campus scenery in the world. Jianghu University in Shanghai, located on the banks of the Huangpu River, is naturally not bad either. But when it comes to buildings, I'm afraid Yenching takes the lead. The advantages of Yenching's buildings are that first, there are many; second, they are well-organized; and third, they are carefully constructed. As soon as you walk into the campus, you feel like everything inside is as carefully constructed as a palace. There are six male dormitories, eight female dormitories, two male dining halls, four female dining halls, one office building, one library, one religious building, about four or five classrooms, I can't remember exactly, one female gymnasium, one male gymnasium, two sister buildings which are used for socializing between male and female students, and also a hospital…etc. There are probably around thirty formal buildings. The buildings are in the style of a row of new imperial palaces, especially the office building, which is the most magnificent. It is said that the construction cost of this one building alone was 500,000 yuan. The top floor of the office building is the auditorium. The auditorium is naturally not as good as that of Tsinghua University, but compared to some universities in the south of the Yangtze River, it is still quite impressive. The acoustics are perfect, the seats are very spacious, the floor is bright, and everything is very good.</p>
<h3>Daxia Girl on the Jar</h3>
<p>When you go to Yenching, if you don’t notice it at first, you will definitely be surprised later. That is, you can’t see a single electric wire at Yenching. Their electric wires are all underground. All the street lamps have a kind of exotic flavor. They are made of concrete poles and octagonal glass tiles. The electric wires are all connected from underground. Originally, Yenching's buildings were only built recently. They are not like other schools, which have no plan or scale in advance. Whenever they have money and think of building a house, they casually build one on any open space. They have a perfect design in advance for all constructions and arrangements, so their houses are very well-organized, and this is also one of the reasons. Yenching's Power House (electrical room) is probably the largest of all the universities in China. The building alone cost 800,000 to build. On the one hand, it supplies electricity to the entire school and the nearby faculty dormitory area, and on the other hand, it also supplies hot water to the entire school and the radiators used in the buildings in winter.</p>
<p>Each dormitory at Yenching University has two floors. Each floor has twenty-odd rooms. Each room houses two people. Each room is supplied by the school with two beds, two straw mattresses for the beds, one cabinet, and the cabinet is divided into two, each occupying one half, one table, one five-drawer cabinet for storing odds and ends or spare clothes, and two chairs. Each room has two windows and a radiator pipe. The lights go off at 11:30 p.m. and come on again at 5:00 a.m. So, people who arrive there for the first time go to bed early and wake up late, and they will definitely think that the lights are on all night.</p>
<p>Each floor has a washing room. You can take a bath or go to the toilet in the washing room. There are tubs and showerheads for bathing, and you can use either hot or cold water. The toilet facilities are also extremely well-appointed. I don't want to describe these any further.</p>
<p>The dining hall is built in the middle of two dormitories. Upstairs is a very large hall, really big and really high. Meals are eaten there. Downstairs, it is divided into several rooms, which are divided into a reading room, a recreation room, a student union office, and "guest rooms" prepared for students' friends to stay for a day or two temporarily.</p>
<p>The meals are entirely managed by the student union. You can either pay monthly or eat separately. Monthly payment is available in two options, ten yuan or eight yuan. If you eat separately, rice is seven cents per person, and the rest of the dishes, you order yourself and pay the corresponding amount. Rice is divided into rice, pasta, and porridge, which you can use as you wish. Dishes range from three or four cents to two corners per plate, you can order as you wish. For example, if you say, "Give me a plate of stir-fried vegetables with oil," it only costs three cents. "Give me a bowl of blood silk soup," it also only costs three cents. "Give me a plate of pork and pork liver stir-fry," it only costs one corner and four cents. I think the convenience of Yenching's meals is by no means in this kind of freedom to eat, but in the agility of the kitchen service. I have never seen any university dining hall with kitchen service as good as Yenching. The waiters are 100% tame, and the dishes are cooked and served quickly. You shout</p>

<p>down, and it will come in a minute or two without having to wait for a long time. You can pay in cash after eating, or you can put it on your account. You can eat in the first dining hall, or you can eat in the second dining hall. Breakfast is available from seven o'clock in the morning until nine-thirty. If you get up early, you can eat, and if you get up late, you can also eat. You can eat fried noodles, soup noodles, porridge, fried cakes, fried noodles, and fried noodles. It is really convenient.</p>
<p>If you like more comfort and don't eat on campus, there are also boarding restaurants near the campus. Speaking of restaurants off campus, they are even better. They serve dinner at night, and for lunch, they change something every day. For example, noodles are eaten on Mondays, scallion pancakes on Tuesdays, Huajiao on Wednesdays, noodles on Thursdays, dumplings on Fridays, etc. It's very interesting and not monotonous at all.</p>

<h3>China Public News Society</h3>
<p>— Brother Tian</p>
<p>The News Society is an organization of students who love journalism and the news business at China Public School. It has had good results in the past. For example, Mr. Wu Dao, the professor of the Journalism Department of St. John's University, Mr. Gu Zhizhong, the principal of Minzhi Journalism College, and Mr. Ge Gongzhen, the reporter of Shenbao, and Mr. Guo Butao, the reporter of Xinwenbao, have all been invited to give lectures. They have also visited the Shenxin two newspapers for on-site practice. All the performances can be said to be the best among the academic groups of China Public School in the past. Unfortunately, the school trend occurred, and in that storm, it—the News Society—also died in the unattended situation. This is such a pity. Because its death is a pity, the impression in our minds is deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>Today, the News Society has been revived with the revitalized China Public School.</p>
<p>"Dear students,</p>
<p>The achievements of the News Society in the past,</p>
<p>I guess you can still recall in your minds,</p>
<p>Now what is our environment, look,</p>
<p>We have Principal Shao Lizi, the founder of the Republic of China Daily, Director of General Affairs Zhu Yingpeng, who serves in the press, and Professor Xie Liuyi, a journalism expert. Under their guidance of rich knowledge and full experience, we must revive this withered News Society and grow our enthusiasm and perseverance.</p>
<p>Students, come quickly."</p>
<p>Under such a notice of sincere appeal, gathering the sincerity and enthusiasm flowing from the hearts of young people, it—the News Society—has been irrigated and revived.</p>
<p>At 7 p.m. on the 29th of last month, in the welcoming applause of more than a hundred students in the auditorium of China Public School, Mr. Huang Tianpeng was invited to give the first academic lecture. People who pay a little attention to the journalism industry will know him. He has written many books on journalism and is currently a professor in the Journalism Department of Fudan University. He is a sincere scholar. The topic of his lecture was "Newsman," which means journalist.</p>
<p>Then he sincerely asked the students to raise questions for him to answer and have a conversational discussion. Then, he talked about the history and editorial methods of major newspapers in Shanghai, and the current situation of Chinese paper mills. Because of the time limit, he hoped to have a chance to talk again next time.</p>
<p>It is heard that the association has agreed to continue to come to the school to give lectures. There are Mr. Xie Dayi, Mr. Zhu Yingpeng, Mr. Shen Gongbi, and Mr. Ge Gongzhen, and there are still several people in contact.</p>
