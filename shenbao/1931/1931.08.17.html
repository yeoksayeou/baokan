<p>在昨評中。記者曾提出動員各地駐軍。從事築堤排水之主張。但言略而未詳。無以引起國人之注意。兹請作更進一步之申述。</p>
<p>軍人之天職。厥惟衛國保民。厥惟抗禦危害我國家人民之公敵。國家人民之敵人。固不僅限於持槍砲以迫我之國外軍隊。或明火執刀擾害治安之國内匪徒。凡足以危害我國家與人民之生存者。即爲吾人之公敵。故衛與保之道。亦不必限於衝鋒肉薄。與敵人爭槍林彈雨中之生死。凡所以爭取我國家與人民生存之積極行動。即皆所以盡其衛與保之道。即皆所以盡其天職。今日洪水爲災。危害我國十六省區。五千萬人民。而且積潦蕩蕩東下。未來之慘禍。更不知伊於胡極。洪流所至。萬里爲墟。當前固可慘。未來更可憂。其足以危害我國家與人民之生存者。顧尙有甚於此者乎。吾人之公敵。顧尙有殘暴於此者乎。而吾軍人之所以盡其衛與保之道。顧又尙有急於此者乎。吾人敢斷言曰。目前洪水。即爲我國家與人民當前之大敵。盡職之軍人。絕對的應起而與禍水作戰。以爭取我國家與人民之生存。</p>
<p>理夫移堀戰壕築工事之力以築堤。堤不足成也。移短兵接戰衝鋒肉薄之精神以排水。水不足排也。移背河决鬬有進無退之勇敢以救援災黎。災黎亦不足救也。移軍用之飛機測量隊以調查災情。測量水量。傳佈消息。亦無一不綽綽有餘裕也。尤有進者。軍隊糧秣。皆已確定。從事防水。可收急效。而無另籌欵項之煩勞。動員國内一部分軍隊。與災區人民恊作。是爲得計。是爲要圖。</p>
<p>至於軍人。本來自田間。誰無妻孥。誰無親友。舉目故鄉。同羅浩刧。爲救自己之妻孥親友計。固應披髮纓冠急起拯救。爲救無數哀哀待死之同胞計。亦應動其至高尙之同情心。急予援手。爲抗禦我國家與人民當前之大敵計。尤應盡其衛國保民之天職。急起向洪水宣戰職。責之所在。良心之所驅使。吾人敢斷言無一人於此肯聲言「不願」。</p>
<p>此次漢口日租界入水。日海軍陸戰隊以人爲柱。植立水中。與水作戰。其精神與熱忱。實有足多者。必如此始無愧爲軍人。始無愧爲克盡厥職之軍人。</p>
<p>基於上述之理由與事實。吾人敢鄭重向當局提出應急之主張。「移軍隊與洪水作戰」。</p>

<p>三十九族之土宜該族旣多平原土宜亦視康藏爲優除穀米外豆麥各種生産均富且多一年兩收之土而金礦尤富畜牧乃其大宗各種藥材爲産物出口之最</p>

<p>昨日起改用新線</p>
<p>上海電話公司在畢勛路區·與匯山區建築自働電話接線間刻已同時竣工所有畢勛區用戶三千四百號匯山區用戶一千九百號均於前日（十五）子夜以後改爲自働電話從此省却呌喚接線之麻煩而於滬巿電話之改裝自働電話上可謂又進一步矣</p>
<p>招待新聞界上海電話公司畢勛路及匯山路兩處新局已於十六日上午一時改用新線該局特於十三日下午二時在畢勛路新局内招待新聞界由職員范寗壽君陪往各部參觀（一）地下室係地線之入口處（二）試線間如遇發生障礙時可即算測發生地點或遇用戶忘將聽筒放置機上時可發響聲使其歸置原處（三）發電間用電汽廠之交流電變壓爲四十八華爾特之直流電（四）電池間如遇外來電流中斷時即用平時蓄電繼續發電（五）調氣間專調温度使各部冬暖夏凉而保機件之安全（六）樓上爲接線間現正預備換線間十五日夜間僅費數秒鐘之手續即可完畢云</p>
<p>改裝線頭由人工接綫電話改爲自働電話手續異常繁重較諸敷設新電話何止倍蓰故該公司從事籌備業已數月即對於前夜之更換接綫間改裝綫頭亦預先擬定詳細工作程序對於各員工應司職務及其工作之前後次序詳爲分配全長共八十二頁亦可見其手續之繁複與佈置之周詳矣當前日傍晚各員工皆集合新舊各區接綫間分往指定工作地點完成最後預備手續於是靜待子夜一時之降臨迨夜半十二時三刻工程管理員在匯山接綫間發出準備命令各處員工莫不執器在手躍躍欲試旣而鐘聲鏘然預定時刻已屆管理員一聲令下全部人員工作齊施先割斷舊綫繼接入新機未幾改裝完畢乃從事較騐工作如發見有些微缺點立即檢出所在地方加以修整聞昨日繼續較騐一日務期盡善盡美而後已</p>
<p>新接線間狀况新接線間内入門首爲電力間裝設發電機與分配電力機及無數電池藉以發生調節本區電話所需之電流次爲較騐間所有通往各區之幹纜與接通本區用戶之支纜均在此處從地底入室接於分配架由此分配於接綫機之各部份有數根幹纜其中所裝話線多至二千二百二十四根粗大可想分配加相有保險機括藉防話線一旦與雷電及電燈線接觸後燒壞接線機據稱用戶家内亦有同樣保險器保護話機所有較騐話線與接線機之機械即分裝架上及架旁總線員桌上遇線路發生障碍時總線員立可騐知其所在派匠修理再進則爲接線室乃自働接線機之所在分行排列以代替接綫生之工作</p>
<p>自働接線租界電話不下數萬號用戶提起聽筒轉動軌板即能由機器接至通話人家百不失一泃非極巧妙之機械不能準確靈便若此其運用情形諒爲閱者所欲知當用戶提起聽筒後接線機上之尋綫器受電力運轉立時尋得該用戶之綫頭將其接通於揀線機此時用戶在聽筒内即能聞得一種嗡嗡聲調謂之撥表軌聲調因聞此聲調後便可撥動表軌也揀線機爲自動揀選所需線路機器目下租界電話號碼共有五碼因設揀線機四組第一組揀綫機裝在本區接綫間内分爲十台每台接連一區話綫如第一臺接中央自働電話區第二臺接路陞區第三臺接西區第四臺接北區第五臺接匯山區第六臺接中央人工接綫區第七臺接畢勛路區第八臺接敏體尼蔭路區第九臺接福建路區第十臺則接特别話綫其號碼僅兩字如向救火會捕房報警等所用今假設有匯山區用戶欲通話至畢勛路區其號碼爲「七三七二五」則該用戶提起聽筒後匯山接綫間内尋綫器立將其綫頭接至揀綫機上發出嗡嗡聲調於是用戶撥動表軌上號碼「七」字揀綫機便將綫路接至第一組之第七臺由此接通畢勛路區接綫間迨撥動第二號碼「三」字畢勛路區之第二組揀線機乃將線路接通第「七三」號支線又次撥動第三號碼「七」字即由第三組機接通第三組「七三七」號支線再次撥動第四號碼「二」字更由第四組機接通第「七三七二」號支線該支線有分線十對凡用戶之首四碼爲「七三七二」者皆接於該支線上最後撥動末碼「五」字即由該支線接通七三七二五號話機電線斯時如該機無人通話則鈴聲大鳴呌人接話同時打電話者便可聞得一種「勃而而」聲調通知線已接通反之如該線有人通話打電話者亦能聞得一種「勃是」聲調報知該線不通此時須放下聽筒待數分鐘後再打吾人觀於上述接綫情形不免連類想及設有許多用戶向號碼相近各家同時通話則接綫機上勢將大感擁擠但按諸實際此層可不必過慮因該局早已預防及此例如匯山接綫間内現備話綫三千號乃設置尋綫器三百六十具分接至揀綫機四十副上且一經接通後揀綫器便可另接地線每次接線時間平均不到二十秒鐘故不致有擁擠不通之虞</p>

<p>— 自在</p>
<p>海洋生産。天然大利。苟得其法。取之不盡。用之不竭。昔管子振興魯鹽。致齊富强逮至今日。英日爲世界第一漁業國。每年出産在一千二百萬噸以。上俄則有一千一百萬噸。美産較少。亦在一百二十萬噸。日人以魚爲大宗食品之一。國人投身漁業者。逹一百五十餘萬人。蒸汽漁輪有二萬餘艘。普通漁船亦有三十八萬餘艘。每年對華魚業。有三千餘萬日金廻顧吾國。水産學校。只有六所。漁輪除廣東浙江各有兩艘外。餘均舊法古式捕魚。水産之不發逹。有由來也。余昨過定海。參觀浙江水産科職業學校。海國物品。至爲豐富。承該校校長金明炤指導解釋無限興趣。特將其數種述之於後。用知海國動物之奇觀。</p>
<p>鮑魚。原名鰒。屬介類之一種。殼爲椭圓形。有足吸著岩石間。惟殼只一面。甚堅。上有數孔。墨魚是其敵。因墨魚爪多。以爪按其殼孔。空氣不通鰒即悶死。而食其肉矣。</p>
<p>飛魚。長只一尺身長瘦圓。齊柏林飛船。即仿其樣式。背有兩翼。能出水飛翔丈餘。惟不能遠。海面有鳥。專食此魚。故即沈下。海中亦有敵魚。遇敵即飛出海面。以資防衛。</p>
<p>鰻俗名鱓。體長。爲圓筒式尾稍扁。多黏液。鱗細口闊。眷部蒼黑色。腹部白黃色。此魚到處皆有。但其生長來源。至今世界各國。尙未有人偵得。苟能尋根探緒。發現其生殖之來源。足以轟動世界之博物界矣。</p>
<p>鯨魚。是世界動物之最大者。外形似魚。實獸類也。大者長至八九十尺。多棲於北太平洋。秋季北盗嚴寒則逐潮流南游。山東沿海有之。其前肢全成鰭狀。無後肢。尾扁平。鼻孔在頂。時浮水。呼出空氣。望之如噴霧。常人不察。以彼體大。食量必豐。然於事實。適成相反。其喉甚窄。不及兩寸。平時只食海中浮遊微物。尺大魚類。不能呑下矣。</p>
<p>其他如有海椰之處則有海珊瑚。江瑤柱屬於貝類。而非屬於魚類。又有一種鬥魚。鮮艶可愛。試知鬥鷄鬥牛之外。尙有鬥魚。刻下吾國。鮮人注意。歐美各國。則早成爲博戲之一矣。</p>

<p>— 烟雨</p>
<p>咖啡爲一種熱帶植物。産地以非洲爲首。南美次之。需先經過一番精煉後始足以供飲料之用。早時。惟熱帶土人嗜飲之。厥後海外通商日興。遂流傳全球。至於今日。則世界上飲咖啡之風。已普遍於各色人種。嗜之者久輒成癮。與烟酒相彷彿也。兹採集海外關於咖啡之趣屑珍聞。綴成斯篇。藉供談助。</p>
<p>非洲土人嗜好如命　非洲土人。習飲咖啡至早。迄今已有六百餘年之歷史。蓋十四世紀初葉。即已有人發明習飲矣。其飲法雖歷經無數改革。但土人之嗜如命。固始終未變也。非洲地處熱帶。終年炎暑異常。而午中尤令人難耐。故土人性情大都懶散。每好就棕梠蔭處。裸體横臥。以消永畫。抵晚始起。則又羣聚歌舞於月色星光之下。而以咖啡佐興載舞載飲樂趣無窮。一杯在手。萬事盡忘。大有南面王不啻之槪焉。</p>
<p>英京倫敦流行亦早　英國在十六世紀。正値女星依利薩伯執政。積極發展海外通商。開今日帝國殖民地之漸。即於是時。咖啡與茶葉。開始由非洲及中國輸入。但數量旣少。飲者極罕。不過流行於倫敦之皇室貴族間。作爲一種珍奇之飲品耳。其間並有一段小小軼聞。至今英倫人士。猶每傳爲談助。蓋女皇依利薩伯。夙好文學提倡不遺餘力。而當時大戲劇家莎士比亞。尤蒙優渥。一日内廷召見。以對應稱旨。破格特賞御用上品咖啡一杯。莎氏於受寵若驚之餘。一飲盡之。俄而辨味奇苦。蹙首無語。女皇對之。亦不禁莞爾。蓋莎氏之飲咖啡。此番猶是破題兒第一遭也。</p>
<p>報逹城遍地咖啡店　阿剌伯人生性愛聽故事。而嗜飲咖啡之風亦盛。阿京報逹。爲一極富於東方色彩之繁麗都巿。吾人苟遊旅其地。則可見街頭巿梢遍地都設有若干咖啡店家。據一九三○年夏。英人威爾勃氏之調查云。報逹全城内。大小咖啡店家。竟有二百五十餘座之多。試往各咖啡店視之。輒有一年老之阿剌伯人或土耳其人。高踞一榻。娓娓向座上聽衆講述故事。而咖啡與烟草之芬香氣息。每充滿室内。中人欲醉亡國民族。聆聞故國王室之遺聞。於嗟嘆之餘。乃以咖啡及烟草。排遣其煩鬱此情此景。殊令人有詩情畫意之感也</p>
<p>華盛頓歐文之巨癮　已故美國大文豪華盛頓歐文氏。著述極富。文名藉甚。生平雅好遊歷。尤喜憑弔古蹟。足跡遍歐洲大陸。於西班牙流連尤久。晚年。並曾由美政府任命爲西班牙公使。故與西國人民。情感特深。據西班牙民間流傳云。歐文生平。酷嗜咖啡。旅居西國後。益爲當地人士所同化。蓋西班牙人之嗜飲咖啡。固遠過於美國也。常人之飲咖啡。每在酒罷飯後。輒有一定時間。而氏則晨興　需索飲。全日之飲料中。咖啡幾佔十之九焉。每當氏握管著述之際。　頭之咖啡壼。尤不可或缺。否則文思且將因而鈍遲矣。</p>

<p>衡陽魏弱叟老伯。年逾七十。窮心六法。筆墨高深。不落時尙。與先師曾農髯交情契合。得未曾有。客冬曾師與弱叟古稀正壽。本擬壽筵合開。乃曾師未屆壽期遽歸道山。弱叟傷感萬端。稱觴之舉。遂即中輟。憶曾師病篤時。曾爲弱叟寫小幅山水。題詩曰。「自濬溪流嘗繞閣。手栽園柳已成隄。刧餘尙有敝廬在。惆悵年年恨未歸」。此幅爲曾師絕筆。於以見二叟情誼之篤焉。頃又得呉劍秋老伯自北平寄轉補壽弱叟集詩。及跋語詩曰。「與君俱長宣和日。垂老眞同釁下琴。不信年華如轉轂。可憐意氣尙憑陵。横林蟲鏤無全葉。醉後龍蛇滿剡籐。師友凋零身白首了無人會此時心。每說人生七十稀。偷閒聊喜息塵機多聞只解爲身累。温飽從來與道違。視滌硯池餘墨漬。誰家井白映荆扉。更餘一事君知否。孤鶴三千歲後歸」。弱叟先生於庚午冬月七十正壽。先生與忘友農髯九兄先後一日耳。九兄不幸。先數月病故。先生傷同類之凋殘。輟壽觴而不舉。高懷古誼。深可佩已。緣集陸劍南詩二首。殊不能工。遙申補祝之意云耳。呉渏譔書。時在辛末仲夏。其詩風骨高騫。實堪傳誦。尤足見曾師弱叟及劍老之交情不以生死易也。愚前月五十賤辰。蒙弱叟責臨白髮蒼髯。精神　鑠。風度動人。語言雋永。今秋七月四日爲曾師週年諱日。弱叟又欲參與曾李同門會紀念會。古情高誼。生死不逾。若弱叟者。眞可以厲末俗而矯薄習矣。（却酬）</p>

<p>沙那大學尙未開辦。其門外樹下有一自由小學有一黑板。用水門汀塗一平臺。在大樹下有十餘童子學書算。此即印度鄉村小學矣。其全班兒童之衣服。不値一元錢也。生活頗似余在缅匈所見之小學校。又行雙樹間。見兩敎師授兩班小學。每班約二十學生。並無桌凳房屋屋。即兩大樹。可稱雙樹學校。因佛湼縏亦於雙樹也。兒人持一筆。有石板坐地上地上。舖一麻袋。印度之鄉村平民學校。如此簡易。然吾亦常游諸王府。其布置奢華。决不亞西人。甚矣階級制度之爲害矣。余游各大都往豪。富之家其佈置一一講究。每飯與在上海西餐館所用之西餐等而。鄉村何其貧也。噫·余常於各江河見小破船上之生活。念上帝何物。造此地球寒熱不均。山水險惡。人種不齊。自非若馬克司之宏願。若何使之一一平等乎。眞未易言也。</p>
<p>印人賭博。似不若華人之甚。其博具亦不同。在公園見有數印人鬬紙牌者。警察來旁觀之。亦不問也。</p>
<p>印度之村制。一村有村長。名曰馬開亞Mukhi六七村成一鄉。有長名朝開亞Choki。朝開亞有警察隷屬之。六七朝開亞成一鎭。有屯大Thana十或十一鎭成一他司利巿TahsiI。四五他司利巿成一縣。一縣之長約可百英里。寛五十英里。縣以下有四級制。又名之爲巿鎭鄉村也。五六縣成一道。一曰Division。四五道成一省。省有大亦有小。印人村落房舍頗堅厚。不似缅甸人之草草。印人比於缅人。印人如千年松柏。龍鱗怒張。缅人如柳。楊垂條綽約可愛。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>「小姐！下面來的一個人眞奇怪！」秋子一看見了丁小姐，却反而呑吐地覺得不好開口就直說了。</p>
<p>「什麽奇怪？你說啊！」丁小姐笑將起來。</p>
<p>「來的是一個女人，伊說是陸先生的……」秋子說了一半，就說不出口了。</p>
<p>「爲什麽這樣的不爽爽快快說個明白？陸先生的什麽呢？」丁小姐也有些疑心</p>
<p>秋子這才不能不說了，伊說道··「來的那個女人，伊說是陸先生的妻子……·</p>
<p>伊是尋丈夫來的！」</p>
<p>話還未完，丁小姐神經上就受到了重大的打擊，一切的情緒都混亂地像在飛躍，最後竟有些發呆了，驟然地從沙發跳了起來，高聲地說道··「有這樣的事麽？」</p>
<p>秋子一看見小姐的神色不對，就知道這一件事要鬧得大了但是伊也絕對没有法子可以安慰着伊的小姐，只說··「那個女人是這樣說了，但是也許裏面還有旁的原因呢！」</p>
<p>「那個女人還在下面麽？你去請伊進來，待我自己去問個明白！」丁小姐說話還鎭靜，但手足都有些　動了，伊跟着秋子下樓去，秋子就去請了小榮的妻子到裏面來，</p>
<p>像一朶花這樣的發現在小榮的妻子的眼裏，伊還彷彿記憶起在蘇州車站上向伊買白蘭花的情景來。但是伊竟發不出怒，雖然伊以爲對面立着的丁小姐正是奪去伊的丈夫的仇人。</p>
<p>丁小姐帶着戰　的聲音發問「你是陸先生的妻子麽？……唉！可憐！……我怎麽早不知道呢？」丁小姐墮下眼涙來了。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子覺得很奇怪本來女人們的眼涙是最能動人情感的伊看見丁小姐哭了，却更覺得没主張，祇呆呆地對着丁小姐出神畢竟自己也哭起來了。</p>
<p>秋子送茶進來，一看見兩個人都在揩眼涙，心頭也自納悶，只有極力的勸奪丁小姐說「有話好說個明白别自己氣壞了身子也不値得！」</p>
<p>丁小姐這才勉强抑　住心頭的悲哀，和小榮的妻子細細地談了起來。小榮的妻子才覺得丁小姐也是個很好的女人。不過受了伊丈夫的騙，所以也吃了伊丈夫的虧。所以伊非但不　丁小姐，反而替丁小姐生了相憐的同情。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Wuhan Flooding <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Dikes Successively Collapse, Refugees Reside in Water</p>
<p>Small Boats Row into Concessions, Situation Increasingly Critical</p>
<p>(Hankou) River water rose four inches on the 16th. The Huangjingtang dike was narrowly saved from a long breach after strenuous efforts. All the dikes in Wuchang are expected to continue collapsing. The Flood Prevention Bureau has instructed the Water Conservancy Bureau to urgently conduct rescue efforts, without shirking responsibility when the time comes. Part of the Yongzhen dike in Hanyang collapsed. Currently, Wuhan refugees are gathered and residing in the water and on the railways. The Emergency Relief Association has decided to provide funds to the disaster victims in various counties to return to their homes. Those who wish to stay will be accommodated. The water levels at Yujiawan and Xujiapeng in the Xiang-E Railway and Xianning all exceeded the railway tracks, but trains are still running. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) River water rose five inches on the 15th. Rickshaws in Hankou City are ineffective. The authorities have decided to increase the number of free ferries. Both the Qiaokou and Huangjingtang dikes are extremely dangerous. The Japanese concession has also been flooded to a depth of four to five feet. It is reported that the Electricity Bureau has announced that it will first stop supplying electricity to the deeper flooded areas if necessary to avoid danger. Southbound trains on the Ping-Han Railway only stop at Erzun Bridge, 295 kilometers north of Chenjiaji, and passengers are still transported by iron barges. On the 15th, the river water in Wuchang overflowed the banks of the Kuaizi Street area. Both gates of Hanyang were flooded. If the dikes and sluices breach again, the entire city will be submerged in a great flood. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The warship Hirado, which was responsible for the security of Hankou, sailed downstream to Shanghai yesterday. Four warships, Uji, Sumida, Toba, and Atami, remain to be responsible for security. At 6 PM last night, marines boarded small boats and rowed into the concessions, patrolling back and forth to take charge of security. At 5 PM, Consul-General Sakane, Vice-Consul Takai, and the former police chief, among others, toured the concessions by boat, visiting various households to express their condolences for the flood disaster. (16th Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Yangtze River water volume increased again yesterday. The flooding in the concessions increased by about five inches today. Fortunately, the reservoir that the entire city is most concerned about is still safe and can still supply water. However, regarding electricity, only the Chinese Street area still has a power plant that can supply a portion of the electricity. The power plants in the other French and former British, German, and Russian concessions, as well as the special districts, the Japanese Residents' Association's Electricity Department, and the Hankou Electric Light Company, have all been completely destroyed. There is no hope of restoring the city's darkness and electricity supply for the time being. Water and heat are intertwined, and epidemics are prevalent. Also, because the ice-making companies have all been destroyed, no ice can be obtained, and patients with heatstroke cannot withstand the heat and have no choice but to sit and wait for death. Only some telephones are still working, but all the mailboxes are flooded. Small portions of the city's letters are also mostly soaked. It is said that it can only be delivered once a day. (16th Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The flooding in the Japanese concession has reached four to seven feet. In Chinese Street and other areas, it has reached 15 feet. Employees of companies and shops serving in the former British concession take regular ships of the Nisshin Company from the Japanese concession to the former British concession pier, then change to boats to go to the company. Looking from the roof of the Daishi Yoko building on Zhongjie Street in the Japanese concession, the Japanese Park has been submerged to the top of the main gate. Only the third floor and above of the Western-style houses and the treetops can be seen. In the suburbs, civilian ships are sailing with their sails unfurled. On the railway lines, countless disaster victims are carrying the old and supporting the young. Chinese merchants are also selling scattered food under tents. The vast water is boundless. If there were no railway lines, the gunboat Otori could enter the back streets of the Japanese concession from the suburbs. (16th Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Yangtze River and the water level in the city's concessions are increasing. The Yangtze River water level has broken through 53 feet. Tens of thousands of Chinese disaster victims regard the railway lines as the only refuge, but they are also submerged under the water. There is now nowhere to escape. Everyone is immersed in the water, suffering from hunger and thirst. A sound of mourning fills the water surface, which is heartbreaking. If these tens of thousands of people immersed in the water continue to be immersed for another week, several thousand people will die in the water. The situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. The water in the Japanese concession is also rising daily, and there is currently no hope of receding. Women and children will first be transported to Shanghai and Japan by convenient ships for refuge. (16th Electric Communication)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Xu Yongchang Expresses Responsibility for Handling Shanxi Politics <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Ge Bao Arrives in Taiyuan and Meets with Xu; Various Parties Urge Yan to Leave Shanxi</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Yongchang has received many telegrams from various parties urging Yan to leave Shanxi to stabilize the overall situation. The Provincial Party Department is also actively urging Xu. Xu is consulting with the generals of Shanxi. Since Yan is visiting relatives and does not interfere in political affairs, he may temporarily stay. He is currently telegraphing Chiang and Zhang for instructions. Xu recently stated that since he was appointed chairman by the Central Government, he is determined to sacrifice everything to take responsibility for getting through this difficult period, and guarantees that there will be no more wars in Shanxi in one or two years. On the 10th, Xu telegraphed Zhang that he was formally taking office as acting chairman of Shanxi Province in accordance with Zhang's telegram order, awaiting the arrival of Ge Jingen, a special commissioner of the Central Government to inspect Shanxi's political affairs, before deciding on the handover of the provincial government. He is currently only handling routine cases. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Provincial Education Association resolved to telegraph the Central Government to replace Feng Sizhi, the Director of Education. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The arsenal is now renamed the Ordnance Repair Institute. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ge Jingen and Bao Wenxue arrived in Taiyuan today and met with Xu Yongchang and others to discuss methods for reorganizing Shanxi's political affairs. The generals' attitude was sincere and unanimously supported the Central Government. Yan and Feng are about to part ways and go abroad. Xu will not go to Beiping for the time being due to governing political affairs. Ge and others will return to Beiping after a slight delay. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan has attracted much attention since returning to Shanxi. Chiang has repeatedly telegraphed Xu Yongchang and others, ordering them to urge Yan to go abroad, and has sent Ge Jingen to Taiyuan to negotiate. Zhang Xueliang sent Bao Wenxue with him. Ge Bao will arrive in Taiyuan today. In addition to urging Yan and Feng to go abroad,</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>They will also discuss Shanxi's military and political issues. Yan Xishan is still avoiding the summer heat in the Baifo Temple. He recently asked Li Shizeng, Zhang Ji, Kong Xiangxi, and others to plead with the Central Government to revoke the arrest warrant for Yan as the main culprit of last year's internal strife. The revocation of the arrest warrant cannot be discussed before Yan formally expresses remorse. It is said that Yan intends to return to Dalian within days if the arrest warrant cannot be revoked. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Provincial Party Department telegraphed the Central Government on the 14th, requesting the National Government to order the Shanxi Provincial Government and the generals of the garrisoned troops to arrest Yan and bring him to justice in order to uphold the law. It also resolved to issue a proclamation to the people of Shanxi on Yan's return to Shanxi, and a warning to the generals of the garrisoned troops not to be used by Yan again and destroy their personalities, leading to a major disaster for the party and the country. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, rejecting the amnesty for Yan Xishan. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Xu Yongchang will discuss the specific arrangements for Yan's going abroad with Ge Jingen and Bao Wenxue: (1) Yan telegraphs his remorse; (2) the Central Government revokes the arrest warrant; (3) Yan leaves Shanxi for abroad on schedule. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang recently told people that under the circumstances in Shanxi and the national ruin, there will absolutely be no more wars. Not only does the economic situation not allow it, but all the soldiers have also thoroughly realized that they will no longer kill each other. He has a plan to suppress the bandits and will never let them ruin the local area again. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Beiping stated that the four armies and eight divisions of the Shanxi army were originally a downsizing plan decided in Tianjin, with a monthly salary of 1.12 million yuan. Shanxi's income allocated 400,000 yuan nearby, and the deputy headquarters subsidized 700,000 yuan per month. Now that Yan has returned, Sun Chu, Rong Honglu, Zhang Huizhao, and other six units of the remaining troops are requesting Yan to be included in this formal establishment. If this is the case, the basic salary for the four armies and eight divisions will inevitably be shaken. It is said that the army and division commanders have jointly sent a letter to Yan, asking him not to interfere, so as not to make the Central Government and the deputy headquarters uneasy, and the originally scheduled subsidies may be temporarily delayed.

<h3 id="e3">Song Zheyuan Arrives in Beiping Yesterday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

Pang Bingxun's troops have arrived in Shijiazhuang, and Pang himself can arrive on the 17th. Feng Yuxiang is preparing to go abroad in southern Shanxi and telegraphed Liu Ji to go to Shanxi with him. Liu has arrived in Shijiazhuang. He met when he passed through Shijiazhuang. His army will open up the Gaoyi and Neiqiu area. He came here to report to the deputy commander on the recent situation of the Shanxi army and the movement of his army. Ji Yiqiao told reporters: (1) Yan's return to Taiyuan was due to being fooled by the Japanese. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable after returning to Shanxi, he is preparing to go abroad again. (2) Pang Bingxun's troops opened up Shijiazhuang on the 14th. Song Zheyuan's troops opened up Yicheng on the 15th and stopped briefly in Taiyuan before opening up Shijiazhuang. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan paid a visit to Ji Yiqiao this morning, and then went to the hospital with Wan Fulin, Wang Shuhan, and others to report to Zhang Xueliang on the deployment of his troops. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Taiyuan stated that after Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun's troops are transferred to Hebei, Xu Yongchang intends to order Sun Chu and Yang Aiyuan to fill in the remaining defense areas in Shanxi separately. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun arrived in Shijiazhuang at 3 PM yesterday. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang's troops have been disarmed by the Central Army. A small portion is still closing the city of Daming and refusing to come out. The merchants and people of the county fear being caught in the crossfire and telegraphed the deputy commander to request that the Central Army temporarily cease fire and resolve the situation peacefully.

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting returned to Beijing today. It is hoped that the third note in the Korean case will be sent out soon. The Fudan Society said that the newspaper actually reported that the Korean case could be resolved without negotiations. Shigemitsu will come to Beijing this week to meet with Wang. There is an understanding between Wang and Shigemitsu. The authorities do not deny it. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the third note to Japan, the draft members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gradually reached a consensus. In addition to refuting Japan's second reply point by point, the focus is still on the issue of responsibility. As for the exact amount of material and life compensation requested, it will be sent out next time. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Zhong Yu Discusses the Wan Case Negotiations, The Future is Not Promising <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Ishii Does Not Allow Abandoning Korean Farmers' Leases</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhong Yu told reporters that he returned to Harbin to deal with public affairs accumulated in February. After a week, he will continue to go to Jilin to continue negotiating. The withdrawal of Japanese police from Wanbaoshan and the exit of Koreans are the prerequisites for negotiations proposed by our side. After several days of negotiations and more than ten meetings, the Japanese side finally agreed to automatically withdraw unconditionally. The ditch and dam will be voluntarily persuaded by our side to farmers not to demolish them before the case is resolved. However, the Japanese police automatically demolished a section of the dam when they left. We are not responsible for protecting Koreans who do not leave the country, and they will also leave the country in the near future. This case is related to Japan's New Mainland Policy, and the future of the negotiations is not promising. The Japanese side's non-compliance with diplomatic regulations in local negotiations is particularly difficult. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jilin) After the police were withdrawn from the Wan case, our side insisted on withdrawing the Korean farmers first, but Ishii did not allow it, so it became a stalemate. Zhang Qingyun, the investigation committee member of the Jiaodao Office, returned and talked about this trip. In addition to investigating the damage, he also comforted the people on behalf of the provincial government. The damage report is being organized by the Chang City Office. There are indeed 22 Korean farmers in Wanxian, but the number of people is over 100, which does not match Ishii's statement of 82 people. The rental of houses and food is sufficient, and there seems to be a secret supply without the intention of withdrawing. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Wan case only resulted in the withdrawal of Japanese police, protecting Tian Dai, the Changchun Japanese leader who caused the trouble for Korean farmers. The Japanese side is willing to replace him, but Ishii, the Japanese leader stationed in Jilin, does not allow abandoning the Korean farmers' leases. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no second step in dealing with the case and will wait for Zhong Yu's negotiations to determine how to respond. (16th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Committee on the Design of China's Gradual Adoption of the Gold Standard has drafted a plan to implement it in stages. This year, gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and our country has suffered huge losses in paying the principal and interest on foreign debts. Therefore, a customs gold unit system is established to prepare for the gradual use of gold. However, my country does not produce much gold, which is not enough to mint coins. If we buy it, the loss will be huge when gold is expensive. Although the Ministry of Finance purchased tens of thousands of large bars this spring and transported them to the United States for coinage, the number is very small and does not help the overall problem. The imaginary gold standard is currently being studied, but no decision has been made. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Move the Troops to Fight the Floods <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's commentary, the reporter proposed mobilizing troops stationed in various places to engage in dike building and drainage. However, the statement was brief and not detailed, and did not attract the attention of the people. Here, please make a further statement.</p>
<p>The soldier's duty is to defend the country and protect the people, and to resist the public enemies who endanger our country and people. The enemies of the country and people are not limited to foreign troops who hold guns and cannons to force our country, or domestic bandits who disturb the public order with knives. All those who endanger the survival of our country and people are our public enemies. Therefore, the way to defend and protect is not necessarily limited to charging into the enemy's gunfire. All active actions to win the survival of our country and people are to fulfill the way of defending and protecting, and to fulfill the duty of the soldier. Today's flood is a disaster that endangers sixteen provinces and regions in our country and fifty million people. Moreover, the stagnant water flows eastward, and the future disaster is unknown. Wherever the flood flows, thousands of miles are destroyed. The present is miserable, and the future is more worrying. Is there anything more dangerous to the survival of our country and people than this? Is there a public enemy more brutal than this? And is there anything more urgent than for our soldiers to fulfill their duty to defend and protect? We dare to say that the current flood is the greatest enemy of our country and people. The dutiful soldiers should rise up and fight the flood to win the survival of our country and people.</p>
<p>If we move the strength of digging trenches and building fortifications to build dikes, the dikes will not be enough. If we move the spirit of short-range combat, charging, and close combat to drain water, the water will not be enough. If we move the courage of fighting with our backs to the river, advancing without retreating, to rescue the victims, the victims will not be enough. If we move the military's aircraft surveying team to investigate the disaster situation, measure the water volume, and spread the news, everything will be more than adequate. Moreover, the army's rations have all been determined. Flood prevention can achieve rapid results without the trouble of raising funds separately. Mobilizing a part of the domestic army to cooperate with the people in the disaster area is a good plan and an important plan.</p>
<p>As for the soldiers, they come from the fields. Who has no wife and children? Who has no relatives and friends? Looking around the hometown, it is a holocaust. For the sake of saving their own wives, children, relatives, and friends, they should rise up quickly to save them. For the sake of saving countless dying compatriots, they should also move their highest compassion and give assistance quickly. In order to resist the current great enemy of our country and people, they should fulfill their duty to defend the country and protect the people, and quickly declare war on the flood. The responsibility lies with them, and the conscience drives them. We dare to say that no one here would say "unwilling."</p>
<p>During the flooding of the Japanese concession in Hankou, the Japanese naval marines stood in the water as pillars to fight the water. Their spirit and enthusiasm are truly admirable. Only in this way can they be worthy of being soldiers and worthy of being soldiers who fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons and facts, we dare to solemnly put forward an emergency proposal to the authorities: "Move the troops to fight the floods."</p>

<p>Thousands of Overseas Chinese in a Dilemma - Envoy Visits Mexican President to Protest</p>
<p>Mexican dispatch from the 15th: Today, the Chinese envoy met with the Mexican President to discuss the matter of Mexico’s discrimination against Chinese immigrants. In regards to the actions of the states of Sonora and Sinaloa to force Chinese immigrants to leave, he strongly protested, claiming that local officials were clearly not able to prevent anti-Chinese activities. Currently, at least 5,000 Chinese immigrants within the two states are in danger. Moreover, the anti-Chinese committee, supported by several members of parliament, has stated that they intend to start large-scale discrimination against Chinese merchants nationwide. The situation for the overseas Chinese is extremely difficult. Even those who wish to leave Mexico are often unable to return home due to lack of travel funds, and the United States has strict prohibitions preventing them from temporarily stopping over, resulting in a situation where they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Afterwards, the Chinese envoy told people that the Mexican President had promised to protect the overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e65">Easing of Tensions on the Guangdong-Guangxi-Hunan Border <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Guangxi troops advancing into Yongzhou withdraw on their own</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Guangdong and Guangxi armies have invaded Hunan by separate routes. He Jian has mobilized a large army to guard the Hengbao mountain passes to await them. According to recent reports, the various units of Zhang Fakui and Guangxi armies that had entered Hunan suddenly retreated on their own, while Guangdong troops did not enter Hunan territory, so the atmosphere has eased somewhat. The situation is recorded as follows: (A) Yongzhou Area: Originally, Bai Chongxi commanded Guangxi troops to advance. All units, including those of Li Pinxian and Liao Lei, have concentrated in Quanzhou. Their advance force, the division of Qin Lianfang, crossed the Huangsha River on the 7th and advanced to Ruozhu'ao, 70 li away from Yongzhou. Unexpectedly, Qin's unit retreated north of the Huangsha River on the 8th and changed from attack to defense, deploying defenses along the Huangsha River, Donggang, and Henan Port. Jiang Sheng, the commander of the Yongzhou Security Regiment, and Hu Tianxiang, the county magistrate, telegraphed the situation to the province. (B) Yongming Area: Originally, Zhang Fakui commanded his units. On the 7th, they had invaded Yongming County. On the evening of the same day, each of the Taozhou and Jianghua counties sent a security patrol team to join the Yongming County security team to launch a counterattack early on the 8th. After about three hours of fierce fighting, Zhang's unit collapsed and retreated towards Gongcheng. Most of Zhang's army is currently stationed between Pinghe and Gongcheng and has not advanced rapidly towards the Hunan border. (C) Chenzhou and Yizhang Areas: Originally, the Guangdong troops led by Yu Hanmou and Li Yangjing invaded from Yuechang and Pingshi. However, this army never entered Hunan territory. The Guangdong troops led by Li have already withdrawn towards Shaoguan, according to a telegram from Zhong Yuying, the magistrate of Chenzhou County. Based on the above situation, the situation on the Hunan border has gone from tense to relaxed. However, He Jian still adheres to his original plan to deploy defenses in Hengbao, while various places in Yongzhou and Chenzhou are still maintained by local county security forces (August 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Communist Bandits in Jiangxi Circulate and Flee in Disarray <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Repeatedly Crushed in Xingguo, Yongfeng, and Ningdu - Nanchang Correspondence: Since the successive losses of Donggu and Ningdu, the bandit leaders Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Huang Kegong, Lin Biao, Xiang Ying, etc., convened a puppet military conference in Ruijin and resolved to concentrate the main force of Zhu and Mao's puppet 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th Armies in the area bordering Yudu and Xingguo to attack the 19th Route Army in Xingguo. At that time, the Jiang and Cai divisions calmly responded to the battle. On one hand, they telegraphed Chen Cheng, Zhao Guantao, and other units to come to their aid. When the Chen and Zhao units arrived, the 19th Route Army changed from defense to offense and ambushed with the support forces. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits fled east from Xingguo via Liantang and changed to attacking the 3rd Route Army stationed in Liangcun, Yongfeng, and Ningdu. At that time, Hao Mengling, who was stationed in Liangcun, personally supervised the deputy division commander and the three brigade commanders to fight fiercely with the bandits for several days in a hail of bullets. When the situation was extremely critical, Chen Mingshu's unit suddenly advanced east from Xingguo, and the Tan brigade of the 3rd Route Army also rushed from Yongfeng, finally defeating the bandits. The bandits then fled east again to Huangpi and Xiaopu and other places in northern Ningdu. The Operations Headquarters yesterday received a telegram from Shangguan Yunxiang and Wen You, which briefly stated, "When my Hao division was ordered to be stationed in Liangcun to suppress the scattered bandits, several thousand remaining bandits who fled from Xingguo suddenly joined forces with several thousand local farmers and surrounded the division. After several times of hand-to-hand combat, the fighting was extremely fierce. After receiving the news, in addition to sending the Tan brigade to reinforce, we also asked the Chen army to advance in separate routes. The bandits were attacked from both sides and fled in a rush towards Huangpi, Xiaopu, and other places. We are still pursuing and attacking." After the bandits fled to Huangpi and Xiaopu, they attacked the local garrison. Zhu Shaoliang commanded the Mao Bingwen, Wei Lihuang, and Luo Zhuoying divisions to surround and fiercely suppress the bandits. From the 10th to the 12th, the fighting around Xiaopu was extremely fierce. As a result, the bandits were again defeated. Zhu Shaoliang also telegraphed the Operations Headquarters from Ningdu yesterday, briefly reporting, "According to the report from Division Commander Mao, more than 3,000 remaining bandits who fled from the Liangcun area were ambushed by my army in advance. The bandits rushed into the encirclement and were then attacked from all sides. The bandits were trapped and unable to break out, and most of them were annihilated by us. Small groups fled to the nearby mountains." According to military sources, the bandits are still circulating and fleeing around the borders of Ruijin, Huichang, Xingguo, Yudu, Ningdu, Yongfeng, Ji'an, and other counties. However, the anti-communist army is determined to pursue and strike hard, and it is expected that the bandits will be completely eliminated when their supplies run out. (August 14th)</p>
<p>Hubei Emergency Relief Association</p>
<h3 id="e67">An Extremely Sorrowful Appeal <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze and Xiang Rivers Continue to Rise, Causing Even Greater Disaster</p>
<p>The Number of Refugees Increases Daily, Threatening to Become a Serious Social Problem</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that since the occurrence of the flood, Hubei Province has borne the brunt of the disaster. Considering only the Yangtze and Han River basins, from Yichang and Xiangyang upstream to Huangmei and Guangji downstream, the disaster is so severe that one can imagine the entire thousand-mile stretch is submerged in water. According to a customs report from the 14th, the river has risen from 51 feet 5 inches to 51 feet 8 inches, and telegrams from Xiangyang, Chongqing, and Yichang all state that there is still eight zhang of water head coming. It is difficult to predict the extent of the disaster in Hubei. Hankou, the area most severely affected, has seen its drainage plans fail. Aside from focusing on flood prevention, the authorities have taken no other measures. The accumulated water in the city continues to rise, rendering rickshaws ineffective. If the water rises another foot, both electricity and water supplies will be cut off. Many originally sturdy buildings have had their foundations weakened due to prolonged immersion in water, and the number of houses collapsing daily is not small. The 10-li foreign concession is in danger of imminent destruction, and the million residents are at risk of drowning at any time. The Flood Relief Association believes that as the disaster continues to expand and the number of refugees increases daily, although efforts are being made to provide relief and prevent them from becoming destitute, the lack of funds will ultimately prove insufficient, which may lead to a very serious social problem. Therefore, on the 14th, it telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, General Commander Chiang Kai-shek, and the Central Relief Fund Committee again requesting that a large sum of money be immediately allocated. It also telegraphed Hubei native associations in various provinces and cities, urging them to quickly provide assistance to save the disaster-stricken people and avert the catastrophe. The original telegrams are recorded below: (1) Telegram to the Central Government, National Government, General Headquarters, and Central Relief Fund Committee: This year, since the beginning of summer, Hubei Province has experienced continuous heavy rains, causing the Yangtze and Han Rivers to rise sharply and the embankments to collapse successively. The number of people who have drowned is countless, not to mention the houses and fields that have been submerged. Wuhan, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers, has seen its 10-li foreign concession become a vast expanse of water. The number of affected people is increasing daily, their cries of distress shaking the heavens. We have previously telegraphed requesting the allocation of a large sum of money for relief. We now find that the water continues to rise, and the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. More than half of the province has been submerged, starvation is widespread, and all industries have been suspended. The extent of the disaster is unknown. Although this association is doing its best to comfort and assist, providing food and medicine, the disaster is extraordinarily severe, and it is difficult to provide relief without a large sum of money. The financial resources of Hubei Province are currently strained, food is scarce, and there is no hope for an autumn harvest. Every resource has been exhausted. The disaster-stricken people who are clinging to life can only hope for immediate relief from Your Excellencies and the Relief Fund Committee. We await your instructions with outstretched necks. (2) Telegram to Hubei native associations in various provinces and cities: We have previously telegraphed regarding the flood situation in Hubei, which we believe you are aware of. This flood is unprecedented in recent history. The vital transportation routes and prosperous markets of the three towns of Wuhan are all submerged in the flood, becoming a vast expanse of water. This association has successively established more than a dozen shelters in Hankou, and is rushing to set up large-scale shelters in the Kai Zi Barracks in Wuchang day and night. The same is true in Hanyang. Nearly 100,000 people are being fed and housed daily. According to reports, the fields and houses washed away and the people and livestock drowned in various counties include Wuchang, Qishui, Guangji, Tianmen, Qichun, Yingcheng, Huangmei, Zhongxiang, Hanchuan, Songzi, Jianli, Mianyang, Echeng, Yangxin, Xianning, Jiangling, Gong'an, Shishou, Xiaogan, Qianjiang, Huanggang, Luotian, Yunxian, Dangyang, Zhijiang, Yunmeng, Jiayu, Anlu, Hanyang, Huangpi, and other counties. It is found that most of the above counties have already been ravaged by bandits or have suffered from partial disasters for several years. Now they are repeatedly reporting flood disasters, and the situation is extremely tragic. Although this association has allocated money for relief, the water continues to rise, and the danger is unknown. The days ahead are long, and our efforts are limited. In addition to requesting the central government to quickly allocate a large sum of money, we also hope that all Hubei natives residing abroad will cut their tassels and lend a hand to the rescue, gathering widespread support and providing continuous assistance. Any amount is welcome. Please let us know the amount you can provide as soon as possible. We send this urgent telegram with utmost sincerity. (August 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Locust and Flood Disasters in Shandong Province <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Dozens of Reports from Various Counties</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that the Shandong Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs has recently received dozens of reports from various counties regarding flood and locust disasters. The department has ordered the counties to quickly take measures for prevention and rescue, and has also sent a letter to the Provincial Relief Association requesting urgent relief. The disaster situation in various counties is very serious, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Flood Situation: (1) In Linyi, the water depth in the city is several feet, and transportation to the surrounding countryside has been cut off, with crops being submerged. (2) In Teng County, the Nangshe River in the 14th district has breached its banks, with water several feet deep on the ground, submerging crops. The Kebao dam in the 13th district has collapsed, and all wheat and autumn seedlings have been submerged. The submerged wheat seedlings in the two districts amount to approximately 70 mu. (3)</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>In Ye County, the Haicang and other districts are close to the coast, and the sea tide has surged, inundating the coastal fields. Approximately 4,450 mu have been flooded in the Haicang district, approximately 2,300 mu in the Xuecun East district, approximately 550 mu in the Xuecun West district, approximately 400 mu in the Tai district, approximately 1,000 mu in the Haizheng district, approximately 400 mu in the Haimiao district, and approximately 1,300 mu in the Zhuwang district. A total of 120 salt fields have been washed away in the Meicang and Xuecun districts. (4) In Jinxiang, the Mei River, Peng River, Kuan River, and Da Zidonggou and other rivers have risen successively, overflowing and flowing horizontally, with several feet of water accumulating on the ground. Low-lying villages in the surrounding countryside have become swamps, washing away houses and crushing people and livestock. Sorghum, soybeans, and grains have all been submerged. (5) In Zouping, on June 25th, heavy rain caused mountain floods, and the Zhulong and Xiaofu Rivers were unable to discharge the water, causing the low-lying areas to become swamps. The fourth, sixth, and seventh districts in the northeast of the city have all been flooded by the heavy rain, with several feet of accumulated water, creating a vast expanse of water. There is no hope for an autumn harvest, and the people are displaced. (6) In Gaomi, the Mo River has a breach in front of Zhanglu Temple in the second district. This summer, heavy rain has caused the water level to rise sharply, flowing northward from the breach, silting up all the bean and grain crops. There is no hope for an autumn harvest. In addition, low-lying areas in Dongping, Dong'a, and Caozhou counties have also been flooded.</p>
<p>Locust Situation: (1) In Liaocheng, on June 18th, locust mites occurred in the Hebei Xibei Tuan in the eighth district, crossing more than ten villages. Autumn crops in all 30 villages of the entire Tuan have been eaten. The county government has led officials, the civil defense corps, and the public security bureau to capture and kill them. (2) The southern part of the first district of Yucheng. (3) Haojiaji, Wangguantun, Wuguantun, and other places in the southeast of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and first districts of Renping. (4) Yizhangtun, Wangbaozhuang, Songzhuang, Luxingtun, Songjiagang, Huxinzhuang, and other villages in the seventh district of Qihe. (5) Yangjiazhen in the northern countryside of the fourth district of Dong'a County. (6) Both the northwestern and eastern low-lying areas of En County, and Liguantun in the south of the river. (7) The areas of Xujia Dabu and Panman Sanba in the northwest of Heze. (8) The areas west of the ancient city in Batun, Shitun, and Wangzhuang in De County. (9) Locust disasters have also occurred in the western part of the third district of Wudi, bordering Qingyun in Hebei. (August 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Pitiful Thirty-Nine Tribes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Since the arrival in Beijing of Peng Chu, representative of the thirty-nine tribes people from the northwest border of Kham and Tibet, the term "thirty-nine tribes" has begun to appear in the newspapers. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Peng at his residence to inquire about everything, and the following is a summary of the information:</p>
<p>The Terrain of the Thirty-Nine Tribes: The thirty-nine tribes are located in the central part of the Kham-Tibet-Xining region, covering an area of approximately 6,000 li. They are located in the east of Tibet, approximately 200 li from Lhasa, and are closely connected to Lei Wu of Xikang. Their terrain is the most level of all the routes from China to Tibet. The China-Tibet Railway takes the Xining route, which is relatively easy to build. The route from Xining to Lhasa must pass through the tribe, which is a region that the country must pay close attention to in terms of transportation.</p>
<p>A Brief History of the Thirty-Nine Tribes: The people of Kham and Tibet call the thirty-nine tribes "Suoba," and in general parlance they are also called "Qiongbo." The meaning of Suoba is similar to that of a border defense commander, referring to a high-ranking official sent by the Chinese emperor to inspect the border defenses. Qiongbo means a person born from a bird's egg. It is said that the ancestor of the tribe was born from a bird's egg, so the people of Kham and Tibet still call them this to this day. Later, the territory was divided into thirty-nine tribes, i.e., thirty-nine large chieftains, each governing dozens of small chieftains, all of whom held hereditary positions. Above the thirty-nine chieftains was a chief administrator, equivalent to the governor of the former Qing Dynasty. Mr. Peng is one of the important members of the chief administrator's office.</p>
<p>The Thirty-Nine Tribes Have Belonged to the Chinese Territory for a Long Time and Have Always Been Known for Their Loyalty. Therefore, the people of Kham and Tibet also call them "Jiadeng," which means Han commoners. The Qing Dynasty's rule was inconsistent. Initially, they were under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Sichuan, but later they were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Minister Resident in Tibet. It is said that the Qing Imperial Envoy residing in Tibet would not be safe in Tibet without the protection of the thirty-nine tribes. According to the old rules, the thirty-nine tribes had 500 guards stationed at the Imperial Envoy's office in rotation. Since Zhao Erfeng led troops into Tibet during the late Qing Dynasty, the thirty-nine tribes have been providing conscripted labor and supplies, which is incomparable to peacetime, and the duties of the chief administrator and officials have naturally become heavier. Mr. Peng Chu is an important member of the chief administrator's office. He is young, intelligent, brave, and willing to take responsibility. He is also talented in literature and economics, so he is particularly committed to the idea of serving China. After the defeat of the border army, he and other tribesmen strongly advocated resisting Tibet. However, they suffered defeat due to inferior equipment and were captured and had their noses cut off. Many colleagues in the tribe at that time were stabbed in the feet and had their noses cut off, such as Si, Che Liwengji, Yu Xiningbu, etc., all of whom were outstanding figures of their time. However, they have not been heard of in China to this day and have not been recognized by our government, which cannot but make people sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>The Soil and Resources of the Thirty-Nine Tribes: The tribe has many plains, and the soil and resources are superior to those of Kham and Tibet. In addition to rice, various grains and wheat are abundantly produced, and many areas have two harvests a year. Gold mines are particularly abundant, and animal husbandry is their main industry. Various medicinal materials are their most exported products.</p>
<p>The People and Customs of the Thirty-Nine Tribes: The entire tribe worships Buddhism and generally observes the precept of not killing. The meat consumed by the people is slaughtered by those who make a living in the slaughtering business in foreign countries. The people, except for the lamas, are all natives, so they all wear lama robes. The lamas mostly belong to the Red Sect, and the Yellow Sect is less common. There are more than 180 temples of all sizes, and the major temples are all headed by Hutuktu. The people offer extremely sincere respect to the lamas. The tribe's internal politics are controlled by the chieftains of each tribe. The people are naturally strong and martial, and their spirit of defending the country and supporting chivalry is admirable. Their strong support for the border army at the beginning of the Republic, with one falling and another following, is a testament to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng's Experience After Arriving in Beijing: After arriving in Beijing for several months without making any progress, Mr. Peng was introduced to Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan, by Nuona Hutuktu. Yu gladly received him, inquired about everything in detail, and checked his background. He learned that he was a native of the thirty-nine tribes and had made contributions to China, unlike those who lived on the border and took the opportunity to act as representatives to seek wealth and status. He told Mr. Peng in person that there seemed to be no reason why the thirty-nine tribes' request to establish an office should not be approved. He could submit another petition to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Therefore, Mr. Peng continued to submit a petition, which read as follows: "Submitting a petition to earnestly request attention to the border areas and approval to establish an office so that our tribe can return to Chinese jurisdiction. Our thirty-nine tribes have belonged to Chinese territory for a long time. Since the Qing Dynasty, we have paid tribute to the country and worked diligently for the royal affairs, as recorded in the border defense files. During Zhao Erfeng's entry into Tibet, our tribe provided food and supplies, transporting approximately 5 million taels of silver before and after, and carrying weapons and arrows to guide the way, which has been resented by the Tibetan bandits. Therefore, the defeat of the border army affected our tribe, causing us to lose our land and country and causing tens of thousands of households and hundreds of thousands of people in our tribe to be occupied and slaughtered by Tibetan bandits to this day. Moreover, our tribe is closely connected to Tibet, guarding Xining and bordering Xikang. In the future, the China-Tibet Railway will be located in a vital area. For the sake of border defense, it is essential to make plans without delay. If the government is to rectify the border defenses and plan the administration, then our tribesmen, as border residents living in the border areas, should establish an office in Beijing to facilitate consultations and provide advice. There seems to be no reason to reject this request. Moreover, our tribe has defended the border for China, causing us to be resented by the Tibetan bandits, losing our land and homes, and suffering under the enemy for more than ten years. The representative has risked his life to travel thousands of miles and has endured all kinds of hardships. If there is ultimately no solution, the representative alone is insignificant, but what about the hundreds of thousands of elders and children of our tribe who are suffering day and night, hoping for the government's rescue? Xikang is listed as an inland area and is allowed to have representatives. Why should our tribe, with its vast territory, admiration for righteousness, and sincere contributions, be placed outside the scope of consideration? Since arriving in Beijing, the representative has been anxiously thinking day and night about the creation of a border region, the reform of the innovative region, the management, the repelling of enemies, the pacification of bandits, and so on. The only way to start is for the government to pay attention to border defense and approve the establishment of an office before there is room for progress. Furthermore, the representative is very unfamiliar with the Chinese language and writing, so there are many errors in the previous submission. This statement is hereby combined and respectfully submitted for approval and compliance. Respectfully submitted by Peng Chu, representative of the people of the thirty-nine tribes in the northwest border of Kham and Tibet."</p>

<p>The All-Manchuria Japanese Timber Merchants Hold a Joint Meeting</p>
<p>A dispatch from Andong states that the counties of Tonghua, Kuandian, Huanren, Linjiang, Changbai, etc., in the upper reaches of the Yalu River, have deep mountains and dense forests and have long been areas that produce timber. No less than 100,000 people rely on this to make a living. Moreover, the timber produced in the Yalu and Hun River basins is of excellent quality and beauty, and it is supplied not only to major cities and ports in the country, but also to Japan and Korea. According to statistics, there are more than 20 Japanese and Chinese merchants in this port who operate in the timber business (commonly known as "liaozhan"), with Japanese merchants accounting for approximately half of the total. Although the amount of timber produced in the upper reaches of the river has decreased sharply since 1923, timber merchants can still make a profit. However, after the opening of the Jihai and Shenhai Railways in the past two years, the implementation of joint transportation has absorbed the transportation rights of northeastern South Manchuria. The timber produced in the Hun River basin is not transported through the Yalu River, but directly to the interior by the Jihai and Shenhai Railways. In addition, the rising gold prices have caused the South Manchuria Railway's freight rates to increase invisibly by more than two times. All Manchurian Japanese timber merchants have been the first to bear the brunt of the impact, and their businesses have declined sharply. Recently, in order to reverse the decline of the timber industry, the Japanese Timber Merchants Association in the Andong Concession has initiated the All-Manchuria Timber Merchants Association. All timber merchants have unanimously agreed, and it was decided to hold the meeting from the 7th to the 9th of August at the Gongban Tong Gonghuitang in the Andong Concession. At that time, more than 30 timber merchant representatives from 16 places, including Fengcheng, Qiaotou, Benxi, Shenyang, Fushun, Tieling, Sipingjie, Changchun, Liaoyang, Yingkou, Xiong'yue, Wafangdian, Huashu, Jinzhou, Dalian, and Lushun, attended the meeting. The following five proposals were passed: (1) Abolish the Korean bonded factory. (2) Reduce the Mantetsu freight rates to counter the Jihai and Shenhai Railways. (3) Restore the Mantetsu construction petition that was terminated. (4) Mantetsu and other affiliated companies should use timber from the upper reaches of the river. (5) Korean railway freight rates should be reduced across the board.</p>
<p>It is reported that the main reason for the All-Manchuria Timber Merchants' meeting in Andong was that the newly appointed President of Mantetsu, Uchida, urgently wanted to implement a new economic policy to save Mantetsu's decline. Because the timber merchants' relationship with the economy is very large, he first gathered all the Manchurian timber merchants in Andong to organize a joint meeting. Andong is a suitable location because of its convenient transportation, and officials and businessmen from all walks of life in Korea can also participate conveniently. It is also heard that President Uchida specified that the proposals passed at this meeting should not conflict with the new economic policy. It is also heard that there were many attendees from all parties at this meeting. Guests included Andong Consul Mizusawa, Kwantung Government Official Muraki, Mantetsu Director Kato, Andong Police Chief Takayama, Lumber Company Director Yagi, Lumber Company Chief of General Affairs Hashimoto, Day Company's Yoshida and Iino Sales Section Chiefs, Chamber of Commerce President Arakawa, Local Committee Chairman Otsu, Andong Shinpo President Kawagoe, Kokkyo Mainichi Shimbun President Yoshinaga, Andong Station Freight Section Chief Nonaka, and Shoko Club's Asakura and Andong Station Chief Chiba. It can be seen that the Japanese attach great importance to this meeting. After the representatives of all parties closed the meeting on the 19th, they left An on the evening train. (10th)</p>

<p>The Preliminary Meeting will Continue This Morning, and the First General Assembly will be Held This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Second Jiangsu Provincial Kuomintang Provincial Representative Assembly held its opening ceremony on the morning of the 15th and a preparatory meeting in the afternoon. The preparatory meeting was originally scheduled to produce all special committee members, but because of an error in the vote count for the presidium of the general assembly, it was delayed until approximately 5:00 PM before it was determined that Ge Jianshi, Zhang Renjie, and Zhang Minquan had been elected. By that time, it was time to adjourn the meeting, so an adjournment was announced.</p>
<p>The 16th was a Sunday, and the assembly announced a one-day recess. On the morning of the 17th, the second preparatory meeting will continue, scheduled to (1) elect the members of the General Assembly Proposal Review Committee, (2) elect the members of the General Assembly Declaration Drafting Committee, and (3) elect the members of the General Assembly Resolution Organizing Committee.

<p>Lu Yaosheng, a Major Bandit in Jiangsu, Captured. Lu Yaosheng, a notorious bandit chief who roamed Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces (i.e., Taibao Ashu's Deputy General), fled to the coastal areas of Fengxian, Songjiang, and Nanhui counties with his followers after his accomplices Zhu Luo and Taibao Ashu were successively executed, creating disturbances. Although the Songjiang-Jinshan-Jiading-Pinghu Bandit Suppression Command offered a reward of 800 yuan for his capture, the bandit frequently sailed the seas, making it difficult to apprehend him. Now, County Police Chief Ding Zhiyan learned of the bandit's whereabouts through reconnaissance and led the Browning pistol team leader Zhu Wenyu, along with police officers, in a surprise attack last night (the 14th). He was captured at the home of salt farmer Chen Shuiqing at the foot of the Qin Gong Seawall outside the Taoist temple. He confessed to the crimes of robbing officials and looting, burning, and plundering in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for the past three years. At the same time, the team also rescued Yang Meimei, a male hostage, from the empty house behind Chen's house. According to his confession, he was 20 years old, from Yaozhuang Bridge, Jiashan, Zhejiang, and was kidnapped by the bandit for ransom. This morning, Captain Ding prepared the documents and escorted him to the county government for interrogation and handling.</p>
<p>Wheat and Grain Association Allocates Funds to Purchase Grain: The County Wheat and Grain Association is now preparing to purchase grain for storage as the new grain is about to be harvested. Therefore, the association submitted a request to the county government to allocate all of the accumulated grain mu tax from the 19th year of the Republic for this purpose. In addition to the 6,640 yuan already received from the grain counters, there is still 2,216 yuan outstanding. A letter was sent to the Finance Bureau today requesting that it find a way to raise funds to meet the needs.</p>

<p>Provincial Security Team Captures Bandit in Kunshan: The Baoshan County Provincial Security Office captured a bandit named Fang Zhengshan a few days ago. He confessed that he was a scout in the bandit gang and claimed that the main bandit ship was currently anchored near Zhengyi. Upon receiving this information, the office dispatched the sixth company of the second battalion, led by company commander Chen Jiayi, along with Fang Zhengshan and more than 30 armed plainclothes soldiers, to Zhengyi by car on the morning of the 15th. They then boarded a boat and headed towards this county, arriving at Xiaoximen outside the city at 4:00 PM. Fang pointed out a boat ahead as a bandit ship. The soldiers ordered the boat to stop and searched it thoroughly. Finding no contraband, they detained the boat and captured Bao Jinzhang, his son, and his wife and daughter, totaling five people. They were then escorted to the county government. After interrogation by Examiner Chen, Bao Jinzhang and his son claimed that they made a living buying and selling lilies in Wuxi, Suzhou, and this county, and denied being bandits. Fang Zhengshan claimed that he made a living begging and was later captured by bandits and used as a scout. He also accused Bao of being Chen Dehai, who had robbed Baoshan, Jiading, Qingpu, and other places, but he himself had never participated in any robberies. The testimonies given before and after were quite inconsistent and incoherent. After the interrogation, an order was issued to Chen's company to escort Bao Jinzhang and his family back to Baoshan by night train at 7:00 PM for further investigation.</p>

<p>Captured Kidnapper Escapes: The kidnapper Zhu, also known as Ah Si, lived near Nijiabang in Beixiacun. The Water Police Division learned of his return and ordered the first detachment of the second district, stationed in Zhujiajiao, to arrest him. Yesterday, Ah Si was captured while drinking tea at the Ruiyuelou by the detachment, and he was detained on a patrol boat next to the detachment headquarters. It was planned to escort him to the county government for legal action in the afternoon. However, the suspect took advantage of the police officers' inattention and swam away. By the time it was discovered, he had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>A Soil Trafficker Escapes in the Middle of the Night: Gu Yinglian, a patrol officer from the Huangdu Public Security Sub-Bureau in the 10th district of this county, received a report that soil traffickers Tian and Hu were transporting a large amount of opium to Huangdu. After receiving the report, Officer Gu personally led police officers to the pier to investigate. They found two men with suspicious behavior carrying a package. After questioning by Officer Gu, the package was opened and found to contain more than ten jin of opium. One person took the opportunity to escape, and only one soil trafficker was captured. He confessed that he was a retired police officer. Both the soil trafficker and the opium were detained overnight, and it was planned to transfer them to the county government for legal action the next day. However, the suspect had disappeared, and the police officers on duty were also missing.</p>

<p>A Wife's Licentiousness Leads to a Husband's Prank: The wife, Qiu, of Mei Kuishu, the owner of the Yongyuanxiang shoe store in the North Gate of the city, was middle-aged but still licentious. Kuishu had repeatedly warned her to no avail and was quite angry. Last night, while his wife was sound asleep, he suddenly used an iron bar used for making shoes to violently insert into his wife's private parts. Blood immediately flowed all over the bed, and she lost consciousness. Neighbors and shopkeepers learned of this incident and immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who detained Mei for questioning. Qiu was taken to the First Public Hospital for treatment. It is said that her injuries are very serious and her life is in danger.</p>

<p>Major Fire Outside the West Gate: Dozens of Jiangbei shacks behind Xinxinyuan on Huang Lane outside the West Gate of this county suddenly caught fire due to carelessness in a certain shack yesterday morning (the 16th) at 1:00 AM, causing a conflagration. Thick smoke filled the air, and the flames burst through the roofs. Upon hearing the alarm, nearby fire brigades rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. It took more than an hour to put out the fire, but dozens of thatched shacks had been completely destroyed. At the time of the fire, laborers cried out and wailed, and their situation was very tragic.</p>
<p>Bandits Kidnap Child, Neighbors Rescue Him: Xia Hezheng's home in Xialianqiao, Xialian Township, 11th district (South Yanshi) was robbed by bandits in February of this year. Xia Hezheng's younger brother was also seriously injured by the bandits. A message was received that six or seven bandits, dressed in short clothes and armed with iron rulers and flashlights, broke open the gate and rushed into the house again yesterday. They kidnapped Xia Hezheng's son, Weisheng (12 years old). Xia Hezheng's wife saw that her beloved son was kidnapped and immediately chased him out of the door, grabbing hold of the bandits and refusing to let go, resulting in her being beaten and injured by the bandits. Neighbors learned of this and came to the rescue, successfully rescuing Weisheng. It was fortunate indeed.</p>
<p>Demanding Debt Unsuccessfully Leads to Death: Wu Anan, a resident of Xuelianqiao Town West Street, located at the junction of Wuxi and Changzhou, is inherently fierce. He is currently running a small shop in the town. Recently, Gong Genquan, a villager from Jixiang Township, borrowed two yuan and eight jiao from Anan. A few days ago, Anan demanded the debt from Genquan but was unsuccessful. He then summoned several locals to Gong's house to demand the debt. Genquan, unable to bear the pressure, was overcome with despair and jumped into the nearby river. No one rescued him, resulting in his drowning. The deceased's father, Songquan, learned of the news and negotiated with Anan, eventually settling the matter for fifty yuan. Poor Gong Genquan is now lying underground in his coffin.</p>
<p>Rape of Daughter Case Heard Again: Ah Xi, the 16-year-old daughter of Xie Daishi, a resident of the Taifu silk factory workshop on Tatangxia outside the South Gate of this county, was raped in the spring of this year by Xie Daishi's lover, Ye Ziping (61 years old), who broke into her room. Ashamed and indignant, Ah Xi threw herself into the river, but fortunately, she was rescued before drowning. The police officers from the Third Branch detained Ye Ziping and escorted him to the county court for questioning and detention. It is now known that the case was scheduled for a hearing again yesterday. The plaintiff Xie Daishi, Xie Axi, and witness Yang Naidong were present. At 10:00 AM, Judge Liang ascended the third criminal court and brought in Ye Ziping, who was in custody. During the hearing, Xie and her daughter firmly stated that Ye Ziping came to rape Ah Xi, and Ah Xi firmly refused. Xu Jinxiu and Zhang Aqiao, who were sleeping with Ah Xi at the time, saw this behavior and reprimanded him. Ah Xi then jumped into the river out of anger, and so on. When questioned, Ye Ziping did not admit to the rape. Next, witness Yang Naidong made a statement. The defendant's appointed lawyer, Sun Zuhong, stood up and stated his defense intentions, requesting that Xie Axi be sent to the hospital for an examination to determine if she was a virgin before further investigation was conducted. Judge Liang approved the request and ordered that Xie Axi be sent to Tongren Hospital for examination. Xie Daishi and Yang Naidong were dismissed, and Ye Ziping was returned to custody to await a further hearing.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Hoarding Rice: The First District Office of Zhenjiang County reported to the Township Offices in the Southeast Gate area that it had recently discovered that rice merchants outside the South Gate were privately hoarding rice transported from the countryside by villagers and reselling it to rice merchants outside the West Gate for transportation out of the county, causing rice prices to skyrocket. The most bizarre thing is that poor people in the southeast are being refused when they go to buy even a small amount of rice. The Third Sub-Association of the Autonomy Research Association has sent letters to the First and Third Public Security Branches, ordering them to send police officers to notify the rice merchants in the South Gate that they must not refuse retail sales. The First District Office has reported the situation to the county government and requested that it issue a notice prohibiting hoarding and prohibiting transportation out of the county. A letter has also been sent to the Rice Industry Association to inform the rice merchants to comply in order to avoid causing a rice shortage.</p>
<p>Captured Soldiers Escorted to Zhenjiang: Ouyang Zhen, the commander of the Special Service Regiment of the Guard Army, escorted more than 1,500 captured soldiers from the front line yesterday by train from Nanjing to Zhenjiang and sent them to the 35th Battalion outside the South Gate for resettlement.</p>

<p>A wife has an affair, and a child is murdered. Qin Xiangbao's wife, of San Guan Township, Xin Jing Bridge, was having an affair with her clan uncle, A Lin. The husband negotiated with the adulterer three times at the San Guan Temple, settling the matter for eighty silver dollars. Later, A Lin regretted it. On the fourteenth night, Xiangbao returned home and argued with his wife, then used a kitchen knife to chop his three-year-old son to death. His wife then reported the crime to the Second Sub-Bureau of Public Security, and A Lin was arrested and sent to the county for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Bandits sought money in the town and requested that they be brought in. Gu Gengquan's grandson, of Gu Shunfeng Lumber Mill in Qin Nan Shuang Jing Gate, was kidnapped on the night of June 25th. A ransom of seven thousand silver dollars was demanded. After the district's first A-level regiment was notified, several people, including Wang Laoer, were apprehended and detained. Later, an informant in Dan Yang Ling Kou identified Dai Yinshi. It was learned that the bandits were hiding in the Xin Feng area. Subsequently, the local militia apprehended five members of the Xing Hui Xiang Xing Da Hui family: Sun Da Ji, Lao Da, Liu Da Sheng and his son. They were sent to the Zhenjiang Security Office, where the military court interrogated them and confronted them with the informant before detaining them. On the 15th, the district regiment submitted a request to the county government to prepare a document to Zhenjiang to bring them in.</p>

<p>Robbery and assault by bandits in Wulonggang. On the night before last, at 9 p.m., the home of farmer Fu Shuangjing in Wulonggang, western township, was suddenly entered by a group of bandits who dug a hole in the back door. The bandits ransacked the house and abducted Fu's four-year-old child, fleeing towards the southeast. Upon hearing the alarm, the First Police Squad of the garrison in Fengluo Village rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already fled. Only one suspect, Li Yushan, was apprehended in a melon field and has been sent to the county for interrogation.</p>

Previously, in the twelfth district of this county, the excavation of the Jiuqu River during the spring floods caused the flooding of farmland, inciting farmers to gather and destroy the houses of various section chiefs. Subsequently, the victims filed a petition with the provincial and county governments requesting compensation and punishment. The county government, upon receiving the petition, arrested Yao Jian and others and detained them for investigation. Now, the provincial government has specially dispatched Commissioner Wang Jigang to Danyang today to investigate the case in detail and handle it.</p>

<p>Bandits are harassing the eastern townships. Recently, large groups of bandits have infiltrated the Xinhe Town area of the Si Jia Ba in the eastern townships of Nantong, setting fires, looting, and kidnapping people. The police and militia joined forces to suppress them, but the bandits relied on the tall green crops for cover and resisted the police and militia until dawn before retreating. Many anti-government leaflets were found in the town, and a temporary curfew was declared in all districts.</p>
<p>Resignation of the County Court President. Jian Jiong, the president of the Nantong County Court, has resigned to the Ministry of Judicial Administration because the court's funds are exhausted, the detention center is facing a food shortage, and he is unable to maintain it.

<p>A record of visiting the canal flood. The canal water level is spreading, and the Zhaoguan Dam is in imminent danger. This is an unprecedented sight since the collapse of the Gaoyan Dam during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, more than 80 years ago. The reporter, recognizing the severity of the disaster, attached a special transport vessel from the Construction Bureau and traveled north to observe the situation. The riverfront houses on both sides were deeply submerged in water, reaching the bay head. The water to the north was even more turbulent. The turbulent currents beneath the Bihu Bridge were deep and forceful, eroding the banks with waves reaching six feet high. All the ships traveling to and fro hugged the west bank, and rowing upstream required thirty to forty people to pull the tow ropes. The high mound on the west bank of the Wayaopu had become a level embankment. Further north, the lakes and waters on both sides were boundless, with only the rooftops of houses floating on the water. The water at the Yidu pier in the Chenjia Gou of the Liuzha Gate was level with the plaque of each memorial archway. Only the top of the Liuzha Jiaoguan Pavilion was visible. The dike willows and the Zhong Da Wang Temple on the west bank were all submerged in the Dragon Palace. Only strands of willow branches swayed in the waves. Along the eastern embankment, for seven or eight li, thousands of people gathered, carrying baskets and soil, frantically running about. The old embankment was submerged, and the new revetment only protruded five inches above the water. The sound of emergency repairs never ceased. The next morning, upon arriving at the Zhaoguan Dam, more than 2,000 people had gathered on the dam because they had heard rumors of the dam being opened. Therefore, in addition to the farmers from the nearby Xiaqiao Township, Zhenwu Temple, and Qiaoshu area, people from Taidong Xing and other counties also came, carrying farming tools and baskets of grain, sitting on mats and assisting in carrying soil to fill the dike. Representatives from the local county government also stationed themselves at the construction site to supervise the work. On the evening of the 12th, Li Mingyang, a member of the Provincial Committee, arrived at the dam with a company of guards and rested at the Sanyuan Temple. The crowd was greatly alarmed, mistaking it for the opening of the dam, and immediately beat gongs and gathered 5,000 people, vowing to protect it with their lives. After the district chief, Yang, declared the intention to protect the dike, the suspicion remained unresolved and did not dissipate overnight. When Li went to Shaoji to discuss raising funds to quickly build a new revetment and saw Li heading to the post office, the people's hearts were finally set at ease.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Gaoyou <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The recent disaster situation in Gaoyou. Since the opening of the Guihai Three Dams, the loss of farmland in the lower reaches of this county has been extremely severe. Since the 8th of this month, a strong southeast wind has suddenly sprung up and has continued to this day. This wind is very favorable for the canal, so although there has been a source of water recently, there has been no major increase in the water level. However, the lower reaches have suffered greatly. Because the southeast wind blocked the dam water from flowing eastward smoothly, the fields and weirs near the city have been repeatedly endangered by the huge waves of the dam water in recent days. Last night (the 11th), the wind was particularly strong, and the Hengfeng, Langpi, Hexing, and Zhangshiliang weirs in the southern township were all breached by the huge waves, completely submerging the fields and crops. This morning, the Hucheng Weir Yangjia Bridge and Jujiada Bridge have been in danger more than ten times. At this moment, the Hucheng Weir is no longer in danger, but the Yangjia Bridge has collapsed for more than a zhang and cannot be repaired. The county government has transported thousands of sacks to the Jujiada Bridge and is still trying to repair it. Residents of this city, Zhao Wanru and Wang Yongwen, and others, because the victims of the various weirs have not eaten for several days, feel deeply saddened and specially solicited funds from various shops and residents to purchase several dan of dry food and went by boat to provide disaster relief yesterday afternoon. Unexpectedly, when the boat arrived at the Gaomiao Weir, the victims swarmed onto the boat before it could be distributed, snatching everything and knocking Zhao and others into the water. Fortunately, they were rescued and did not drown. The tragedy can be seen from this. The Red Cross Society of this city specially sent staff member Zhang Shihai to Lake West to rescue the victims. So far, a batch of 44 people has been transported to the Caishin Temple Lake West Refugee Camp in the city. The association has also sent people to the various weirs in the lower reaches to rescue the victims. However, because the houses of the victims have been submerged in water, but the rice, wheat, and other items in the houses have not been taken out, they are temporarily staying on the weir bank or under large trees to guard them and are unwilling to come to the city. The association has dispatched people to the lower reaches to salvage corpses because many people and animals have drowned.</p>

<p>Newly appointed officials of the newly formed Sixth Division. Cheng Daizhou, the commander of the newly formed Sixth Division of the National Revolutionary Army, and Bai Lefu, the deputy commander, have been ordered to take office. They are actively preparing for internal organization. It is reported that yesterday, Zhou Liuwu was hired as a Major General Counselor of the Headquarters, Huang Tingyu was appointed as the Director of the Military Supply Department, Zheng Xitao as the Lieutenant Colonel Counselor, Zhang Chao as the Counselor, and Gao Gongxu, Gao Weixin, Yang Tinggui, Yan Chengquan and others as adjutants.</p>

<p>Gambling case at the train station. The station master dismissed from his post. Li Bin, the stationmaster of Linping Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, was arrested by the local Public Security Bureau last month for gambling under the platform with Lai Xilin, Chen Tonglin, and others, and was sent to the Hangzhou District Court for interrogation. After investigation by the Prosecutor's Office, it was confirmed that Lai Xilin and Chen Tonglin were guilty of gambling and were prosecuted. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration also sent personnel to thoroughly investigate Li Bin. As a result, it was determined that the stationmaster had indeed violated the law and neglected his duties. Yesterday, an order was issued to dismiss Li from his post and deduct three months' salary as a warning.</p>
<p>The murderer appeals the verdict. Chu Xiaomao, a farmer from Xiaoshan, killed Tang Jinlin with a sharp weapon due to a gambling debt dispute. He was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment by the county court. He appealed, and the High Court has now learned that the trial of the case resulted in the original sentence being too light and should be revoked and changed to thirteen years of imprisonment. He was ordered to be escorted back to the original county for execution yesterday.</p>
<p>Hangzhou tap water is officially supplied. After the full water test by the Hangzhou Tap Water Preparation Committee, the sludge in the water pipes has been repeatedly flushed clean in recent days. Yesterday, the official water supply has begun. Users who registered before the water supply and paid the deposit in accordance with the regulations will be exempt from water charges for one month. However, the eastern street area is still under construction because it is not a prosperous area.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Pinghu <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Another robbery case near Xincang. Zhu Arong's family, located in the Li Jia Langxia of the Sanqing Port near Xincang in the eastern townships of Pinghu, was relatively well-off. On the night of the 12th, several robbers suddenly broke into Zhu's house and ransacked it at will. Zhu's daughter was scheduled to marry next month, and the dowry she had prepared was all robbed. The robbers stayed for three hours. However, Zhu's family had been robbed several times last year, and this loss was even greater than last year.</p>
<p>Police officers were suddenly arrested. Yesterday (the 15th), Zhang Afu, a police officer from the Xincang Public Security Sub-Bureau in Pinghu, whose family lived in the Luwan Temple in the eastern townships, was suddenly arrested by soldiers from the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team stationed in Qianjiawei Town, Jinshan. First, they guarded the Public Security Sub-Bureau, then entered and arrested Zhang Afu, and escorted him to Qianjiawei. It is said that the reason for the arrest was that he had colluded with bandits.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Chief dismissed and investigated. Fang Menggeng, the Chief of the Pinghu Public Security Sub-Bureau, was previously the Chief of the Zhapu Sub-Bureau. A nameless floating corpse was found in the outer sea. It was said that it was carrying more than 1,300 yuan in cash. Fang did not report it to the county and buried it without permission. Later, County Chief Wu learned about it and sent someone to verify it. He then submitted it to the hall for review. It is now learned that the hall has ordered Fang to be investigated and that Zhang Huanwen, a staff member of the Qingxiang Bureau, has been appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Shaoxing <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Changes in the organization of tobacco and alcohol tax inspection. The Shaoxing Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau has been ordered to be renamed the Tax Inspection Branch Bureau, reducing the area of jurisdiction and dividing it for management. The inspection offices and inspection stations previously under its jurisdiction have also been changed and abolished. Inspection stations along the Yantang area, such as Xixing, have been abolished. An office will be established in Qianqing, a key export area of Shaoxing, to inspect goods shipped out. Inspection stations will still be established in Cao'e on the east and west routes of Shaoxing wine, and branch offices will be set up in other areas such as Wengang for patrol to prevent tax evasion.</p>
<p>The provincial government has approved the use of tin foil customs tax receipts to offset payments. Because tin foil from various Shaoxing foil shops must pass through customs and pay customs duties when shipped to other provinces, most of these taxes are required to offset the regular tax. Because the Jiangzhe foil special tax has been contracted by the foil merchants, there has been no solution to the customs tax issue, causing disputes from time to time. The Tax Contracting Association has submitted a petition to the Finance Office requesting assistance. It has now been ordered that customs duties collected by customs for foil that has been transported through customs after the special business tax has been paid be allowed to be submitted by the association for verification and deduction.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Anqing <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Severely punish the derelict county magistrate. Wang Yunlong, the former county magistrate of Fuyang, has been removed from his post for dereliction of duty. The government has now handed him over to the court for investigation in accordance with the law. After Wang was removed from his post, he was handed over to Huaining County for custody and later released on bail. He has now been transferred to the court.</p>
<p>The Guangfeng Weir has collapsed again. The Qingfeng Weir in Duhu, on the north bank of the Yangtze River opposite Anqing, collapsed at 5 p.m. on the 10th due to excessive wind and waves. The Hucheng Weir in Anqing is also in constant danger. If the Hucheng Weir is not protected, boats could travel on land within the city of Anqing.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Bengbu <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The weather is clear, and the water level is gradually receding. Previously, Bengbu had continuous heavy rain and a flood that turned the surrounding area into a vast expanse of water, almost a swamp. The water depth in the East and West Amusement Parks, as well as Guozhi Street, Huachang Street, Taiping Street, and Xin Da Ma Road, ranged from two to three feet to four to five feet. In the past few days, the weather has been clear and hot, and the water level has receded. Dry land has appeared in Huachang Street, Lao Da Jie, and other areas. The water in the East and West Amusement Parks has receded by two to three feet. Many of those who had taken refuge from the water have returned home to repair their houses. However, the crops in the four rural areas have all been flooded and killed, making it difficult to harvest anything in the autumn. The disaster victims are now clamoring for relief.</p>
<p>Bandits in Fengtai. Large groups of bandits, including communists, have been found in the Tianjiaji area of Fengtai County, northern Anhui Province. They are manipulating and commanding, committing arson, murder, robbery, and all sorts of evil deeds. At the beginning of the month, the Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, the Huaiyuan Security Regiment, the Shouxian Provisional Second Brigade, and the Independent Battalion joined forces to suppress them. Although the bandits suffered setbacks, they have not been completely eliminated. Recently, they have mixed with nearby water bandits and are accustomed to intercepting merchant ships on the water, making them very rampant. Xia Futang, the county magistrate of Fengtai, is preparing to lead the police to suppress them and has specially sent a letter to the Bengbu Public Security Bureau requesting that they seal two small steamships to be used in order to advance by land and water and eliminate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3 id="e89">Letter from Zhang Wenyao, Head of the Third District of Songjiang County <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>I recently praised your newspaper's Songjiang communication column for publishing an article entitled "Dismantling Aircraft Creates Complications," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the morning of August 12th, after 8 a.m., a Jiangpeng aircraft landed in the Hebang Township area, damaging more than one mu of autumn rice in the field of villager Zhang Xuanchun. Mr. Zhang claimed compensation for the loss. Subsequently, He Jian, the aircraft instructor, asked the district office to mediate and ordered the police to protect the aircraft to avoid further losses. The district chief and Assistant Han cordially entertained him and urged Officer Xu to send police to protect the aircraft. They also persuaded Mr. Zhang to accept 20 yuan in compensation to resolve the matter peacefully. On the evening of the 13th, the aircraft was dismantled and transported to the Xinqiao Station for shipment to the Hongqiao Airport for repair. There was no fact that Assistant Han demanded 200 yuan in compensation. On the morning of the 14th, at 9 a.m., Officer Xu Guodong of the Tenth Sub-Bureau, due to illiteracy and improper handling, was criticized by Assistant Han. Holding a grudge, he fabricated facts and reported to his superior, leading a group of armed police to illegally coerce and attempt to arrest Assistant Han, interfering with his freedom. At that time, half of the district was agitated. When the district chief heard the news, he rushed to the scene and argued reasonably. As a result, he and Assistant Han each appealed to the higher authorities. Xu's transfer and Han's fake resignation have already aroused public outrage in the entire district, and they have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Interior and the Department of Civil Affairs requesting a thorough investigation. I am writing this special letter to request that you investigate and correct the facts to reveal the truth. With great respect, Zhang Wenyao, Head of the Third District of Songjiang County, August 15th.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang, 16th: The Jiangsu Province's education budget for the 20th year has already been resolved by the Funding Committee.

<p>Re-election by the Commissioner's Office to Send Outstanding Students to Higher Education</p>
<p>Xu Yanmou, the Special Commissioner of Weihai, has spared no effort in improving local education in his daily work. In less than a year, he has been able to transform it. For 32 years under British rule, a policy of keeping the people ignorant was maintained. All schools were either private schools of the absolutely laissez-faire type or missionary schools of cultural aggression. As a result, the atmosphere was closed, almost like being outside the pale of civilization. Only after the recovery was it possible to make major reforms, such as banning private schools, screening private school teachers, delineating school districts, opening schools in various villages, testing primary school teachers, recruiting educational talent, establishing the First Middle School, and implementing Party-oriented education. The educational circle in Weihai has undergone fundamental transformation through this vigorous and earnest implementation, and a vibrant atmosphere has gradually taken shape. Recently, in order to support talent, Special Commissioner Xu has raised funds and stipulated measures to send Weihai students to higher education. A total of 20 places have been allocated for middle schools, universities, and vocational schools. Examinations were held twice in late July to select outstanding students to send to higher education.</p>

<p>Canada's victory over the United States was expected. The United States' defeat in all three groups over two days led to their total elimination, a disappointing irreversible decline. Yesterday's singles match between Canada and the United States initially saw some struggle, but it gradually became unsustainable, ultimately leading to a complete collapse. Devaux's skill was indeed superior to Squiers. At the beginning of the first set, Squiers was agile and dynamic, like a dragon gaining power and eclipsing the world. However, he became careless when leading 5-4, and missed a good opportunity. His 5-7 loss was regretted by the entire audience. In the second set, Squiers performed worse than before, managing only to defend without making any progress. In the third set, Devaux became stronger, and Squiers' technique became more chaotic, ultimately leading to a "bagel" set loss. Canada's Devaux completed a great feat in the opening round and will soon compete with China. Because the outcome has been decided, the remaining doubles and singles groups between Canada and the United States will not be held.</p>

<p>Machida (6-1) Masters</p>
<p>The Japanese doubles team of Hyotare Kumagai and Machida is well-known for its strength. Kumagai's comprehensive coverage can compensate for Machida's shortcomings. The English doubles team of Masters is not famous in history, but his consistent performance is remarkable. After intense battles, the veteran Tuckey was lacking in stamina. At the beginning of the match, the English doubles team repeatedly approached the net to attack, but the Japanese were cunning and broke through with a high lob. Unable to succeed, England lost four games in a row. Masters' cannonball serves won back a game. After winning another game, they lost two more in a row, suffering a 2-6 defeat. From the second set onwards, the Japanese continued to control the field, and the English had no way to fight back. They quickly completed the set with six consecutive games. The power of the Japanese was evident. In the sixth game, Kumagai launched a fierce attack, but he was too hasty, and the ball went out of bounds, giving England a game. England's momentum gradually increased, and they seized the opportunity to counterattack. The two players defended closely at the net, attacking left and right to their heart's content, winning three games. Masters' serves continued to be powerful, and Kumagai turned the situation around, securing the victory with a score of 6-3. In the third set, the Japanese were unstoppable and invincible. Soon, they succeeded with a score of 6-1. Tomorrow, England and Japan still have two singles groups to play: England's Wheatley against Japan's Kumagai, and Japan's Machida against England's Tuckey. Judging by the overall situation, Japan is likely to win, but the English are determined to put up a strong fight in the hope of a miracle.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Gold Prices Continued to Rise Last Week <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>A Strong Upward Trend. Last week, the trend of gold prices became even stronger, reaching 780 taels at one point. Following a gradual path, it almost had a strong upward trend. It began to rise sharply at the beginning of the week, and then fluctuated constantly, creating a revolving situation, hovering above 70 taels. During the week, there was a review of 30 taels, and a total increase of 24 taels was calculated. This was because the US government released the US cotton estimate, and although prices had fallen, there was still concern that it would affect the silver market. In addition, due to the mixed international news, people were restless. The prices of silver in England, the United States, India, and Shanghai exchange were all firming up, and the exchange rates of English in the internal market were high for those who shorted silver. Therefore, the market price became increasingly tight, and even broke through one shilling and three pence. At the end of the week, the rollover for October arrived. The shorts still paid a premium of 3 taels and 2 or 3 mace to 3 taels, but the shorts had plenty of spot goods, so the rollover was raised. The transaction volume of the exchange was only about 30,000, and the opening price for October was 776 taels, which once reached 80 taels and 0.08 qian, and closed at 78 taels and a half. As for the closing price, calculated according to the daily exchange rate, the road for the day seemed to become more active and the price increased by about 10 taels. However, there was no significant outflow of large silver, and there was no increase or decrease in yesterday's (16th) telegram. The future of gold prices may still fluctuate. The details of the week's developments are summarized below.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the forward process. Since Monday (August 10), large silver has shrunk by 125, and the silver price has shrunk by 25. The shilling exchange rate has not changed at first, but has been changed three times, a total of one and a half gears (375). As the internal market became increasingly tight, the shorts were eager to cover. The opening price of gold for September was 56 taels and a half, an initial increase of 4 taels and 7 qian. US cotton suffered a severe drop, but due to the excitement of buyers, the price suddenly rose. In the afternoon, it peaked at 80 taels and closed at 77 taels and 6 qian, a sharp increase of 25 taels and 8 qian compared to last Saturday. Throughout the day, there was a total of 24 taels of difference. Speculator Mr. Wu came and went again, while Mr. Lu bought in general. The shorts rushed to cover. The next day, large silver shrank by 25 again, US silver by 375, and the shilling remained unchanged. The internal market seemed tight, but the gold market was actually lower, with an opening of 72 taels and a half. This was because the footing was bad. The United States bought in after the market closed. After that, the buying party was active and fell to 70 taels and 0.07 qian, and then increased to 75 taels and a half. The afternoon close was flat. In the afternoon, because Mr. Luo and other longs added to their positions, they suddenly jumped to 10 taels and reached 85 taels and a half, closing at 81 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 4 taels compared to the previous day. The market fluctuated by a total of 15 taels. On Wednesday, large silver rose by 0.0625, the US silver price remained unchanged, and the exchange market was apparently flat but secretly loose. The opening of the gold market was a small drop to 76 taels and 2 qian. Then, New York reported an increase of more than 5 yuan, followed by a drop to 73 taels. Afterwards, Mr. Luo and others bought in and increased their positions, and then broke through 80 taels again, reaching 83 taels. After that, it was suddenly heard that Bidderman had submitted a memorandum opposing the United States to Congress, requesting that a relief meeting be convened quickly. The news spread and caused panic, causing a plunge of more than 10 taels to 70 taels and 0.03 qian, closing at 72 taels and 2 qian. The afternoon initially softened and then stabilized, closing at 73 taels and 7 qian, a small return of 7 taels and 9 qian, with a difference of 12 taels and 7 qian. On Wednesday, large silver remained unchanged, the silver price increased by 1.125 shillings as before, and the internal market was quite flat. The opening price of the gold market was slightly lower at 71 taels and 5 qian. There were ups and downs of 3 or 4 taels, reaching 70 taels and 0.06 qian, and then seeing 75 taels again. The afternoon was peaceful, closing at 73 taels and 5 qian, slightly smaller by 2 qian compared to the previous day. The next day, large silver remained the same, the silver price returned to a small 1.125, and the shilling remained unchanged. The internal market seemed to grow. The opening of the gold market was still flat at 73 taels and 8 qian, and there was not much fluctuation afterwards. Then, because of the sale of 500 taels by large households, it broke through 70 taels, suddenly becoming 68 taels and a half. Afterwards, there seemed to be more buyers, returning to 70 taels for 73 taels and 8 qian. The afternoon was extremely peaceful, closing at 71 taels and 3 qian, falling slightly for three consecutive days, with a total of 2 taels and 3 qian (a total of 10 taels and 3 qian). On Saturday, large silver remained unchanged, US silver remained the same, and the shilling did not change. The internal market seemed tight, and gold prices continued to rise. Initially, the futures were paid a premium of 3 taels and 2 or 3 mace by the long side, and then 3 taels. However, there were quite a few who had not settled. No further entries were made in September, and most were switched to October. The opening price was 76 taels, and then it rose from 74 taels and 8 qian to 80 taels and 0.08 qian. The afternoon close was 78 taels and a half, with a fluctuation of 6 taels. The high and low prices of silver in England, the United States, India, and the exchange market are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Stagnant State of the Bond Market Last Week <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Consolidated Tax Continues to Rise by One Yuan, One Jiao, and More, Remaining Firm</p>
<p>Consolidated Sixes, Demobilization Bonds, and Others Declined Slightly</p>
<p>During the past week, the bond market at the Shanghai Stock Exchange saw extremely scarce spot transactions. The entire week saw only 30,600 yuan in transactions, with 19-customs accounting for 13,000 yuan, and the others only several thousand yuan. In addition, the Huashang Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Bank stock each saw 10 shares traded, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank stock also saw 10 shares traded, with prices significantly exceeding face value. The daily transactions throughout the week were only 2.05 million yuan on Monday and 1.5 million yuan on Wednesday. Tuesday saw about 1.36 million yuan. The latter half of the week saw an average of only around 9 million yuan. The total for the week was 76.9 million yuan, a decrease of over 3.31 million yuan from the previous week. Consolidated tax and 20-year customs transactions were still more active, with consolidated tax accounting for 28.45 million yuan (August issue 17.1 million, September issue 11.35 million) and 20-year customs accounting for 18.655 million yuan (August issue 13.08 million, September issue 5.575 million). Other bonds were relatively quiet, such as 20-year Cigarette bonds (7.605 million yuan), 19-Charity bonds (4.965 million yuan), 19-Customs bonds (7.275 million yuan), Demobilization bonds (4.475 million yuan), Disbandment bonds (2.76 million), 9-6 Public bonds (1.145 million yuan), Consolidated Sixes (940,000 yuan), Customs bonds (565,000 yuan), and Financial bonds (45,000 yuan). The situation was calm, and the bond trends were stagnant. The rise in bond prices in recent weeks had reached a considerable height, and the market seemed to be entering a period of decline. On Monday, prices fell by half a yuan to 8 or 9 jiao. On Tuesday, prices rebounded by 7 or 8 jiao. On subsequent days, except for consolidated tax rising by 9 jiao on Friday and the 20-Customs rising by 6 jiao, the others were extremely dull. Although daily increases were often greater than decreases, they only fluctuated by 2 or 3 jiao. The overall result was a continued increase compared to the previous week, but only consolidated tax rose by 1 yuan and 1 jiao, while others mostly rose by only 4 or 5 jiao. Only consolidated sixes, demobilization bonds, and 9-6 bonds saw slight declines. The bond market appears unlikely to experience major fluctuations in the near future. The high and low prices and price changes of various bonds during the past week are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e120">Yarn Prices Plunge by Four to Five Taels Last Week <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yarn prices plummeted last week due to the larger than expected bumper crop of US cotton, throwing the world cotton market into disarray. The local market became increasingly apprehensive, and the sharp decline in prices created a sense of freefall. Actual demand was increasingly weak, and even though the kebang [native place guilds] attempted to buy, they held back due to the unfavorable situation. As a result, trading was also shut down. On Monday, yarn prices dropped by five to six taels, triggering profit-taking and bargain hunting, which stabilized the situation somewhat. However, a certain major merchant's sentiment remained depressed, and he was willing to sell at 145 taels. When prices rose, he still shorted. At the weekend, there was some trading in coarse yarn by the Yunnan and Guangdong kebang, and the Sichuan kebang also saw some activity, tightening the market slightly. Yarn prices rebounded by two to three taels. As a result, prices for all months fell by four to five taels compared to the previous week. Trading was exceptionally active, setting a new record since trading began. The amount of purchases made by each kebang are listed below:</p>
<p>Kebang Amount (包) Kebang Amount (包) Kebang Amount (包)</p>
<p>Yunnan 5,000 Sichuan 2,000 Inland 1,20</p>

<h3 id="e121">Cotton Market Plunges Sharply Last Week <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>US Cotton Delivers a Major Blow</p>
<p>The cotton market experienced a sharp decline last week as the US government's cotton production estimate exceeded expectations, causing panic among cotton merchants worldwide. At a time when consumption in various countries is weak, the bumper crop will be unmanageable in the future. As a result, Japanese merchants such as Dongmian liquidated their long positions one after another, and retail investors panicked, causing the market to plummet. On Thursday, news came that the US Agricultural Adjustment Administration had proposed destroying one-third of the new cotton, which slightly stirred the market and led to a rebound of 5 qian. However, major traders took advantage of the rise to sell in large quantities, and most manufacturers bought cheap US cotton to hedge against standard cotton, as local cotton was several taels higher than US cotton. Some believed that after the sharp fall in US cotton, there would be a period of consolidation. The severe floods in various regions would affect the new cotton, tightening the long positions and unwilling to let go. However, the overall situation of the world cotton industry is pessimistic, and the surplus abroad is disheartening. The outlook is mostly bearish. The price of standard cotton fell by 1 tael and 8.9 qian compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume was 1,000,034. However, the active trading volume set a new record. Factories bought 20,000 to 30,000 cheap US cotton, with 1,300 bales from Yao cotton. US cotton fell by more than 100 pounds compared to last week. The purchase prices made by each manufacturer are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Nan Shi rice market, with about forty suppliers, continues to be sluggish. The sale of Su Chang thick japonica rice is uneven; the market is high, but transactions are somewhat slow, and prices are weak. The price of Er Chi, Zhongguan, Tongli, and Taozhuang rice and below has generally decreased by four to five jiao per yuan. Sales to rice wine producers and food carriers have also declined, and the market has fallen. Transactions of Yi Chi and Luyang sharp rice are slow, and the market is slightly soft. 200 shi of freshly harvested Pudong japonica rice have arrived, but the market is extremely sluggish, and prices are falling by about half a yuan per day.</p>
<p>Incoming goods from the New Gate inland are still surging. Sales of Changxi and North japonica rice are extremely slow, and prices are loose. Kunshan and Danyang white japonica rice are also trending downwards, and the situation is even worse. The large-scale resumption includes 5 Chi Chong Gu, Qing Jiao, Songjiang, Xitang, etc. The fall in rice prices has turned sluggish, with a decline of two to three jiao due to the quiet buying. The supply of Luyang sharp rice and pier sharp rice is slightly scarce, and prices have not risen or fallen. Sales of glutinous rice have also declined, and the situation is weak.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber in various regions have become sluggish again, and prices have also fallen. This is because the supply of existing goods exceeds demand, making it difficult to be optimistic for the time being. In addition, due to widespread flooding, the appetite for it has also been affected. The current market price for customer goods is 20 yuan to 18 or 19 yuan, with middle-grade goods selling for 20 yuan and lower-grade goods selling for 16 or 17 yuan. The market trend is flat and sluggish.</p>

<p>Taikoo Sugar Allotment Plate Slightly Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was quiet due to the lack of telegrams from the production area, as it was Sunday. There were very few allotment plate transactions in the public association market. There was a slight intake of coarse sand and white crystal sugar from Dutch Sugar No. 24. The transaction price remained at 11 taels and 6 qian. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 11 taels. High Dutch red sugar was 9 taels 9 fen and a half to 9 qian and a half, with a still firm trend. Taikoo sugar transactions were also scarce, and the market also declined slightly.

<p>Although Overseas Silk Prices Have Risen, The Exchange Rate Shrinkage Still Causes Little Price Increase</p>
<p>Chinese Silk Is Insufficient... Attitudes Are Pessimistic</p>
<p>Last week, the local foreign firm silk market was still difficult to activate. It was found that European and American silk weaving factories have successively started work after the summer vacation. In the raw silk market, factories have replenished their positions for raw silk from various countries. However, the competition for sales in Japanese silk still favors the Sino-Italian raw silk prices. Although the surface has risen, the frequent shrinkage of the exchange market has caused the Sino-Silk to draw into China. The price of the bank is still trending lower. Although the silk electricity has been transferred to Shanghai, the Chinese silk is not slack and the losses are too huge. The attitude is negative and the transaction is sparse. Last week, the transaction of Sino-Present Silk was less than 200 bales and the export was more than 600 bales. There were no special circumstances in the Chinese and foreign silk markets during the week. The local market prices of Chinese silk overseas at the end of last week are listed below (New York price per pound, unit gold yuan, Lyon price per kilo, unit franc)</p>

<h3 id="e138">Business Community Appoints Representatives to Petition in Beijing to Resist Goods <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Requests the Central Government to Issue an Order for All Regions to Rise Up Together</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chen Songyuan, and Others are Appointed as Representatives</p>
<p>Stores Should Clearly Mark the Source of Goods Sold</p>
<p>After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's temporary members' meeting unanimously decided to automatically resist Japanese goods, the ongoing actions to resist Japanese goods have been extremely smooth and have shown a planned and sustainable spirit. It is now heard that the business community believes that the boycott of Japanese goods must be carried out consistently nationwide in order to achieve the greatest effect. Representatives have been appointed to petition the central government. Excerpts of relevant news are as follows:</p>
<p>Appointment of Representatives to Petition in Beijing: The business community believes that since this city resolved to boycott Japanese goods, various regions have responded actively and have organized anti-Japanese and aid-to-overseas-Chinese organizations to implement economic severance with Japan. However, the actions of the masses must be led by the party headquarters in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. It has been decided to appoint Wang Xiaolai, Wang Jie'an, Chen Songyuan, Zhang Minghai, and other four people as representatives to petition the central party headquarters in Beijing to issue an order for party headquarters and mass organizations in all regions to rise up together to boycott Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Stores Should Mark the Source of Goods: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all industries in the city stating that according to a letter from the Anti-Japanese Association, the goods sold in the stores of various industries in this city often do not indicate their source, making it difficult to identify which goods are Japanese and which are domestic. This is inconvenient for customers who purchase goods and creates many obstacles for the association's inspections. Therefore, the tenth standing committee meeting resolved to notify all stores to clearly mark the source of goods within ten days. Please ask the association to send personnel to investigate in order to prevent counterfeiting. It is hereby requested that this be investigated and transferred to the industry guilds to notify the affiliated stores to comply. We deeply anticipate this. It is hoped that this will be investigated and transferred for compliance.</p>
<p>Registration of Goods to Be Handled in Accordance with Regulations: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Sugar Industry Association regarding the registration of Japanese goods to be handled in accordance with regulations. The letter states: "Dear Sirs, We received your letter on the 14th of this month regarding the goods of Yuantaiheng Sugar Company that were seized. You stated that they had previously declared their willingness to pay relief funds and supplement the registration. However, it has been more than ten days since we requested information from your association on how this matter is being handled, but we have not received a reply. We have already replied to your association's letter of July 31 stating that for registration, a registration form should first be obtained and filled out in accordance with the regulations, and then transferred to the Anti-Japanese Association for handling in accordance with the regulations. We believe that you have read it. Subsequently, on August 4, we sent another letter to the Anti-Japanese Association stating that the goods seized by the company were indeed registered with the association on August 1 and requested that they be handled in accordance with the regulations after the registration period expired. The association replied that they would handle it in accordance with the regulations after the forms were sent. This is the course of this case. As for how the Anti-Japanese Association handled it later, since there are already steps to deal with Japanese goods in such cases, which can be based on the above, it has been stated that we will not reply to each case. This is the reason for your association's request. However, the meaning of 'handling in accordance with regulations' in your association's so-called request to transfer to the Anti-Japanese Association for handling in accordance with regulations seems to refer to immediately approving its passage and sale. However, the procedures in this regard are not simple. After the association receives the tables sent by us, the first step is to review or investigate, the second step is to inspect and add seals, and the third step is to obtain a certificate for sale. The goods registered by each industry are thousands upon thousands, and they must be handled one by one. Before this procedure is completed by the association, it is naturally impossible to inform you. This is a detailed letter in reply for your investigation and transmission to the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association."</p>

<p>Japanese Soldiers Did Not Dare to Infringe, Cars Sent to Warehouse for Safekeeping</p>
<p>The Zhabei Inspection Office of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association previously seized dozens of bundles of Japanese goods in the Suzhou Creek and was preparing to send them to the warehouse for safekeeping. However, the treacherous merchants colluded with Japanese imperialists to achieve the purpose of delivering and transporting the goods, and instigated a large number of Japanese soldiers to snatch them away with loaded guns. The inspectors on the scene at the time had no choice but to return to the office to report and devise a plan. The treacherous merchants and others believed that their scheme had been successful and that there was a shortcut to sell Japanese goods without worrying about difficulties. Therefore, the same hemp bags that had been snatched away were found again in the Suzhou Creek the night before. In view of the previous loss, the Zhabei Inspection Office made thorough plans and immediately dispatched all inspectors, vowing to resist violence again with the spirit of sacrificing themselves in hand-to-hand combat. On that day, the Japanese soldiers, seeing the agitation of the public, did not dare to invade again. A large number of Japanese goods were seized in a tense atmosphere. All the inspectors guarded them on the boat overnight, and in the early morning of yesterday, they ordered the cars to send them to the Zhongxing Warehouse on Zhongxing Road for safekeeping.</p>
<h3 id="e140">West Kitchen Workers Went on Strike the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Due to Assistance with Negotiations on Treatment Conditions for Western Restaurant Workers</p>
<p>Following the refusal of employers to reinstate Western restaurant workers in this city who had resumed work on the orders of the authorities the day before yesterday more than one hundred Western kitchen workers joined the strike on the evening of the previous day to offer their support and the negotiations on their treatment conditions have also begun. The situation yesterday is recorded below in separate sections:</p>
<p>West Kitchen Strike: The Western restaurant industry is divided into two sections: one is the waiters, belonging to the Western Restaurant Workers' Union; the other is the head cooks, belonging to the West Kitchen Workers' Union. The workers of the Western Restaurant Workers' Union went on strike collectively over treatment conditions. After the employers refused to reinstate them when they resumed work on orders the day before yesterday the West Kitchen Workers' Union, to show their support, joined the strike uniformly at 6 p.m. on the afternoon of the previous day (the 15th). To maintain business, restaurants such as Quanjiafu, Daguanlou, Xinlicha, Taipingyang, Zuihechun, and Huangong were maintained by the managers who personally worked to ensure they could continue to operate normally.</p>
<p>Union Congress: The Western Restaurant Workers' Union held a meeting of member representatives at 3 p.m. yesterday, attended by over a hundred people. Wu Shenxiang was elected as chairman. He reported on the refusal of the employers to reinstate the workers after they had resumed work on orders from above, as well as the situation of the West Kitchen Workers' Union joining the strike. Following this, discussions began and resolutions were passed: (1) to submit a further request to the City Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to punish the employers who refused to reinstate the workers; (2) to send representatives to various restaurants to persuade non-union members who continued to work and disrupt the strike discipline.</p>
<p>Beginning of Negotiations: The Social Affairs Bureau had summoned parties for questioning in order to facilitate mediation regarding the treatment conditions put forward by the Western Restaurant Workers' Union, but due to the absence of the employers, progress could not be made. From yesterday, the West Kitchen Workers' Union dispatched representatives to act as mediators and the Western Restaurant Industry Association also dispatched representatives to begin negotiations with the workers' side. A resolution may be reached within days.</p>
<p>Union Statement: The Shanghai Western Restaurant Trade Workers' Union refutes the statement of the Trade Association and informs all circles of the truth, writing: "Fellow elders, brothers, and comrades across the country! This spontaneous strike by Western restaurant workers is because the managers of various Western restaurants intentionally sabotage the labor movement, and have no sincerity in accepting the treatment terms we have proposed. They even dare to dismiss workers one by one in labor disputes, thereby arousing the public outrage of all workers. Know that the dark secrets of what these managers do is to deceive the true capitalists above, and oppress and exploit the workers below. However, our proposed improvement terms do not cause any loss to the capitalists, but merely aim to reclaim the various rights that have been gradually stripped away from us by the managers, and to correct the illegal means of arbitrary dismissal of workers, and to break the reason why petty cash is not made public." Because the income of our workers is only three or four yuan per month, we rely entirely on adding petty cash and extra foreign dollars. Unexpectedly, this petty cash is not only not distributed publicly as usual, but is over-collected and under-reported, and then ingenious names are used, such as Taiping shares, Caishen shares, and public accumulation shares, etc., but in fact, they are all pocketed by the managers. The illegal organized Trade Association in 1927 also has its expenses drawn from petty cash, extracting one share from each shop every month, and accumulating to seven or eight thousand yuan so far, excluding expenses. Even more outrageous is that workers who do not work in the shop also have this petty cash extracted for miscellaneous expenses such as laundry, flowers, tea, uniforms, passenger ticket stationery, etc., also extracted from this petty cash. Managers already get huge salaries and rebates for purchasing goods, as well as rewards and dividends from the capitalists, which are considerable. As for us wanting to limit him to no more than three shares, one is to uphold magnanimity, and the other is to prevent them from asking for whatever they want. If the manager deprives this reward, the workers serve customers like slaves. Since the manager's personality is high, so-called hospitality to customers in person, etc., his labor is an obligation that should be fulfilled on his position, how can he shirk the duty of being in the service and say he deserves to be paid. If he is not worthy, it is still difficult to share, not to wait for the workers to demand improvement. There are already examples of similar words wanting to cover up the eyes and ears of the world, and the fifth and sixth articles say they are violating the law. For example, in the third article, the union's expenses and the expenses for the undertakings to be handled should be appropriately subsidized by the capitalists according to the union law. We require extracting one share of petty cash, which originally belongs to the workers. It is nothing more than adding a procedure to them through their hands. If the fifth article is to limit the apprentices with specific regulations, such as the sixth article, workers should not be dismissed without reason, and workers who do not join the union should be used to obstruct the union and labor movement, and in the future, workers should be dismissed according to the general rules of the union. Ask, do these requirements violate the law? Such as the fourth article, double wages are required in July and August because the Western restaurant business is particularly good in July and August. The workers' work is either all night or all day, and their hard work is doubled. All labor festival commemorative festivals should be on leave, and those who do not stop work should also be paid double wages. This kind of requirement is perfectly reasonable. If the seventh article says that the kitchen waste is related to the capital of the shop owner, how can it be said that it is usually put into the petty vendors' public distribution? It is obvious that there is a contradiction and shield in the language. Because the kitchen staff has no unexpected income other than wages and petty cash, this kind of waste should belong to them to enjoy. Moreover, the level of living is increasing day by day. Our workers cannot only not improve their living and improve their treatment, but also be exploited layer by layer, still being bound by these fierce and vicious managers like cattle and horses, wouldn't they be crying miserably? They intentionally cite new workers to refuse the reinstatement of our workers, which aroused the public outrage of all the Western kitchen workers in Shanghai, and they all went on strike to show their support and to urge them to wake up. From now on, stand together, endure the pain, and strive to fight a desperate battle with these demons until the purpose of signing a contract in good faith is achieved. I also hope that all circles will understand the truth and uphold our justice."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Record of the Hubei Fellow Townsmen Gathering to Raise Disaster Relief Funds <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Enthusiasm of Those Who Pledged and Donated on the Spot</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Hubei Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai's Committee for Raising Emergency Disaster Relief Funds for the Hubei Province invited fellow townsmen to the Pacific Western Restaurant, including Jiang Zuobin, Guan Jiongzhi, Song Jiju, Han Yongqing, Ma Shaoqing, Wang Shao Cheng, Gao Jianqing, Yi Nanzhen, Du Xiangqing, Sun Songnian, Zhang Jitang, Liu Diechen, Wang Shutang, Zhu Jingsheng, and more than seventy others to attend the meeting. Guan Jiongzhi was elected as chairman and the ceremony was performed. The chairman reported on the situation, briefly stating that the disaster in Hubei is serious, with over 40 counties in the disaster area and millions of disaster victims. Over 200,000 disaster victims have gathered in Wuhan, all crying for food and clothing. Relief is urgently needed. The association has previously received telegrams from the Hubei Provincial Government and the Emergency Relief Association, etc., requesting assistance. They immediately began raising funds and remitted 10,000 yuan to the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce through the Shanghai Bank for He Hengfu, Zhou Xingtang, Cai Fuqing, Zheng Xieqing, and Xiao Chunqing to receive and forward. Subsequently, Ambassador Jiang Yuyan was requested to urge Xu Jingren to quickly allocate funds. Ambassador Jiang, along with Wang Shao Cheng and Gao Jianqing, requested disaster relief from Du Yuesheng, who generously donated 5,000 bags of flour. Many fellow townsmen have been donating in recent days. For example, yesterday an anonymous person donated 100 yuan, and an old woman on her last breath also donated 2 yuan. Although the amounts are uneven, the enthusiasm is the same. However, the disaster is serious and a drop in the bucket will not help much. It is still hoped that all fellow townsmen will actively contribute to save the fathers, elders, brothers, and brothers of the hometown who are in trouble. The merit will be immeasurable. Next, Gao Jianqing reported (1) that all relief funds raised will be temporarily deposited in the Shanghai Bank and receipts will be issued by the bank (2) that no relief funds will be used for any expenses and that Ambassador Jiang provided the most support for this trip, and the committee members such as Liu Wanqing, Liu Renshi, Wang Shao Cheng, Sun Songnian, and Ming Runshen are also very enthusiastic. Then, Ambassador Jiang was invited to speak, briefly stating that he admired the efforts of all of you in running around in the summer heat. I have contacted Xu Jingren, saying that there are a total of sixteen provinces affected by the disaster this time. He was advised to allocate relief funds according to the severity of the disaster and not to organize by province. He has now appointed relief specialists to ask Hankou whether they need rice, flour, or cash. After receiving the reply, he will take them there immediately. If any fellow townsmen need my help, I will do my best, and so on. Then, those who pledged and donated on the spot included Wang Shao Cheng, Ma Shaoqing, Huang Shunji, Jiang Yuyan, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhang Weimin and Qin Runsheng, representatives of the Porcelain Industry Association, Song Jiju, Wang Hengqing, Chen Jingshan, Xin Anzhai, Zhu Qianjiqing, Anonymous, Gao Jianqing, Du Xiangqing, Yi Nanzhen, Sun Songnian, Lu Xingjie, Cao Dongchuan, etc. The total amount of donations and pledges was 22,250 yuan. In addition, Cheng Yao Cheng, Zhang Ziyu, Wei Futang, Qiu Zipei, Cheng Feilan, Cheng Dongchen, Liang Shanfu, Xia Yubin, Yu Yanqing, Chang Caichen, Xiong Juju, Xiao Chaosheng, Jin Puquan, Zeng Xingchu, Fan Wenhua, Li Yushan, Liu Shixiong, and Liu Jialun all signed up to solicit donations. Lawyer Liu Shixiong also proposed a disaster relief plan. Liu Yixin and Wang Shoushen, fellow townsmen in the film industry, sent letters stating that they were willing to have the theater industry and fellow comrades perform dramas to assist in disaster relief, which shows the enthusiasm for general relief. It was also resolved that a donation booklet should be printed immediately in the name of the Hubei Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai's Committee for Raising Emergency Disaster Relief Funds for the Hubei Province, and that all directors of the Fellow Townsmen Association who participated in this event and all fellow townsmen who attended the meeting today to pledge and donate should be listed on it to solicit donations. After the meeting, everyone gathered for dinner until 7 p.m., when they all left happily.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Appeals from All Walks of Life for Flood Relief <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Governor Zhang's Telegram on Behalf of Disaster Victims in Northern Jiangsu Begging for Assistance Reads:</p>
<p>Urgent: Shanghai Flood Relief Associations in Various Provinces: Public Announcement. Unfortunately, the country has suffered repeated disasters. The devastation caused by this flood is unprecedented. Taking Northern Jiangsu as an example, the floodwaters in the Gaoyou and Shaobo areas are vast and boundless. From Shaobo and above to Qingjiang along the west bank of the river, the entire area is a vast expanse, completely turned into a swamp. Houses have collapsed, the old and weak have drowned, and the number is uncountable. Those who have not drowned and have escaped are living in sheds on the west bank of the river, stretching for hundreds of miles, all being grass sheds for disaster victims. Wives lead their husbands, children carry their mothers, emaciated and haggard, crying for food and clothing. White-haired old people and yellow-mouthed infants groan on the roadside, and grieving women and orphans wail on both banks. The sight of the disaster-stricken people is unbearable to witness. The Wuliba and Lujin towns east of Gaoyou have recently collapsed one after another. The disaster victims along the east bank of the river are displaced and have nowhere to live. The desolate situation is beyond words. As the Governor of Jiangsu, I have witnessed this tragic situation and am worried day and night. I humbly request that your associations provide urgent assistance so that these remaining people will not be left to die. It would be a great blessing for the region and the country. Zhang Zhijiang humbly awaits orders with urgency. [Seal]</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai Received a Letter Yesterday from the Zhengyang Town Chamber of Commerce and Various Trade Associations in Shou County, Anhui, stating:</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zhengyang is located in a low-lying area and is prone to flooding, especially this year's flood, which is unprecedented. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has formed a swamp. Following the wheat harvest, torrential rain fell for three days and nights, and the nearby dikes were all submerged. Crops were all swept away by the flood, and countless people and livestock drowned. At that time, the water from the upper reaches of the Huai and Pi Rivers surged and combined with the rivers in the lower reaches, such as the Fei and Ying Rivers, which were blocked and unable to drain away, causing the water level to continue to rise, becoming a vast ocean. Zhengyang was in danger, with many parts of the city walls collapsed, the streets three to four feet deep, shops closed and sealed, boats passing through the main streets and alleys, and residents' houses collapsing. Those who came from afar to escape bandits and those who came from nearby because of the flood either gathered in temples or stayed in high buildings in the city, and some were trapped on sandbars, clinging to tree branches and calling for help, living in desolate tombs and neighboring wild ghosts, and the dry coffins floated into the city with the waves, and the floating corpses roamed with the waves. Passersby grieved for their fish, and residents were all in Chen's distress. Women and children wailed, and the old and weak awaited death. The water soaked and exposed them, their bodies were swollen and unbearable, and their faces were emaciated. The Rakshasas of hell appeared, and the tragic situation was like this. Even if Zheng Xia presented a map, he could not have painted it in such detail. Our association witnessed this and was heartbroken. We have reported the disaster situation to the Nanjing Central Disaster Relief Committee and the Anhui Provincial Government for their review. However, the water tide is about to recede, and we all hope for sunny days. On July 24th and 25th, there was another heavy rain, and the flood tide rose sharply, which was even worse than the previous days. The vast catastrophe has been repeatedly encountered, and we lament that the lives of the remaining people are completely cut off. We have always admired your association's sincere feelings for your hometown and your concern for the suffering of the people. We hereby inform you of the serious water disaster in Zhengyang and the situation of lives being on the verge of death. We humbly request that you publish it in the newspaper and appeal on our behalf. If you can send national currency as soon as possible to obtain relief funds, or if you can accept donations from philanthropists, you will be bathing in compassion. This is all bestowed by your association. We respectfully kowtow on behalf of the disaster victims, and so on. We replied by letter that we would cooperate in calling for assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Ministry of Communications Formulated Preferential Measures for Flood Disaster Telegrams <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>It is Reported That the Ministry of Communications, Due to the Serious Situation of the Recent Floods, Requested the Flood Relief Committee for Special Approval to Issue Telegrams and to Request Various Disaster Areas from the Bank of China, Mobil Oil Company, British American Tobacco Company, and Educational Association, etc., Regarding the Free Transmission of Telegrams Related to the Investigation of Floods, and the Following Measures Have Been Established: (1) The Free Flood Disaster Telegrams Issued by the Above-Mentioned Agencies Are Temporary in Nature (1) The Text of These Free Telegrams Shall Not Involve Other Matters Besides Flood Disaster Affairs (1) These Free Telegrams Shall Be Limited to One Place of Destination and Receipt per Telegram (1) These Free Telegrams Shall Be Limited to the Use of Chinese and Foreign Codes, Not Exceeding One Hundred Characters per Telegram (1) The Bottom of These Free Telegrams Must Be Stamped or Signed by the Person in Charge of the Sending Agency (1) These Free Telegrams Shall Be Limited to Transmission Through the Lines of Domestic Telegraph Offices and Stations (1) These Free Telegrams Should Be Prefixed with the Word "Relief" Before the Name of the Receiving Station to Distinguish Them</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce Replied to the City Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Collection of Funds for Disaster Relief <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Although the Market is Bad, Efforts Should Still Be Made to Donate, But There is Much Pain and Suffering About the Current Situation in the Country</p>
<p>The Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce of the Netherlands East Indies sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, expressing much indignation and pain over disaster relief and saving the country. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, on July 21st, we received an English telegram from your association, which roughly translates as follows: "The anti-Chinese movement in Korea is extremely cruel. The number of overseas Chinese who have suffered and returned to the country is as many as several thousand. The letter asks for disaster relief to be distributed through our association. We hope that overseas Chinese will quickly help donate funds and remit them through our association for distribution," etc. Then, we received an urgent telegram from the Hong Kong and Guangdong Flood Relief Association also asking for disaster relief. The Guangdong flood disaster, etc. In view of this, our association immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee on July 24th to discuss the matter. Everyone said that it is our unavoidable duty to raise funds for disaster relief. Although the market in Southeast Asia is extremely bad, all circles will definitely do their best to help. However, one thing that is most painful is that the domestic war is about to break out again. Even if the country is poor and its wealth is exhausted, it seems that they do not care at all. When the Chinese overseas in Korea are suffering the most, they still cannot eliminate their opinions and make concerted efforts to face the outside world. Moreover, they have not even considered that the cost of military action for one month can save the lives of several thousand Chinese overseas. Instead of doing this, they are speeding up the war. The overseas public opinion really does not know how the country is governed. If this is so profound, it will also cause many obstacles to fundraising. Except for the obligation of raising funds, the commercial and overseas Chinese cannot prevent the military and political authorities from acting recklessly. Outsiders mock that the Chinese have a unique nature that cannot be distinguished. Although our association will still do its best to convene a joint meeting of overseas Chinese groups to make a large-scale fundraising. We will report on the results later. Correspondingly, we will first reply to your association about the decided situation for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Pan Gongzhan Speaks on Nationalism and Anti-Japanese Movement <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Broadcast on the Great China Radio Station Yesterday</p>
<p>The Guomin Society said that the Third District Party Department of this city invited Mr. Pan Gongzhan, a member of the Standing Committee of the City Party Department and Director of the City Social Affairs Bureau, to broadcast a speech entitled "Nationalism and the Anti-Japanese Movement" at the wireless broadcasting station of the Dachanghua Electrical Appliance Company on Nanjing Road at 10 a.m. yesterday (the 16th). The following is a record of his speech: "Everyone, today I am here to speak on nationalism and the Anti-Japanese Movement. Nationalism is the first of the Three Principles of the People of the Chinese Kuomintang. There are three main points of nationalism. The first point is to treat the five major ethnic groups of China, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, equally. The second point is to treat all ethnic groups in the world equally. The third point is to help all small and weak ethnic groups in the world so that they are in an equal position. Combining these three meanings can make nationalism achieve its completion. Nationalism is to prevent any ethnic group from being oppressed by any ethnic group or oppressing any ethnic group. It is to put the Chinese nation on an equal footing with other nations in the world. Now, the imperialists are using military and economic forces to invade China, which is caused by unequal treaties. This time, Japan instigated Koreans to massacre Chinese overseas Chinese, resulting in numerous casualties and property losses. Why should Chinese people in Korea be slaughtered by Koreans? The cause is extremely small. The Japanese transplanted Koreans to my Jilin Wanbaoshan to forcibly plant Chinese farmers' fields, and conflicts occurred. Japan immediately sent troops to protect the Koreans and forcibly seize them. This situation is entirely the Japanese using the Koreans to invade my country. After the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, Korea has become a colony of Japan. Since then, Korea has no country. Therefore, the Japanese will never want Korea to develop. Why does Japan want to help the Koreans to forcibly seize our farmland? This is Japan's clever way to use the Koreans to colonize the three eastern provinces. In case the Chinese people oppose, they will send troops to interfere. Because of the Wanbaoshan case, Japan provoked Chinese and Korean animosity. The Koreans relied on the Japanese army and slaughtered my Chinese overseas Chinese. This is what Japan wants. Japan treats China as an insignificant country and can do whatever it wants. This situation is completely contrary to the nationalism advocated by Sun Yat-sen. If we all believe in nationalism, we should all unite to resist Japan's aggressive behavior. Japanese warlords and Japanese hooligans do not want the Chinese nation to have a position in the world. Under this kind of oppression, we should all uphold the same goal to resist Japan. Now we must pay attention to the methods of anti-Japanese. Thinking of this, we must look at the attitude taken by the government and the people. We should be willing to forgive the government because there are bandits in the country in Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and other provinces. In the north, there is the rebellion of Shi Yousan. In Guangdong, there is the reaction of unscrupulous politicians. The losses from floods in various provinces exceed 80 million to 100 million. In such a position, the government must suppress bandits on one hand, fight rebels on the other hand, deal with unscrupulous politicians in Guangdong on the other hand, and provide relief to the floods in various provinces on the other hand. How much energy can be devoted to diplomacy? Therefore, to make diplomacy strong, we should look at the backing of diplomacy. Now, the Chinese army is not substantial and has no power to resist Japan. Therefore, now we can only fight with justice and the people's own power to make the Japanese people at home automatically realize and oppose the Japanese warlords and hooligans. Chinese people have boycotted Japanese goods several times, but they have failed in the end. Why do we have to do it again this time? There are two points worth noting in this anti-Japanese movement. The first point is that we hope that it is not only for the Korean incident that we oppose Japan, but to recognize that our Chinese nation demands a way out and opposes Japan, and the anti-Japanese work cannot be stopped just because the Korean case is over. The second point is that we hope that the anti-Japanese movement will be planned, not a general anti-Japanese movement. China now has its own raw materials for most of its goods, and most of the manufactured goods are foreign. According to China's customs statistics for the past two years, six out of ten of these goods are Japanese goods. If China continues like this, it will become a slave of Japan. Looking at it this way, we must have a plan to boycott Japanese goods and revitalize domestic goods. For example, although China has a lot of coal reserves, it does not have enough power to supply factories across the country. Then, the factories can only use Japanese coal. There is also a layer to boycott Japanese goods. First, we must boycott luxury goods, and daily necessities and raw materials cannot be forced to boycott. Finally, we hope that we will not boycott Japanese goods and use other foreign goods. If we cannot achieve these points, the five-point fever will only be ridiculed by the Japanese. However, the biggest key lies in the hands of the business community. It is like seeking skin from a tiger to discuss boycotting Japanese goods with the business community. When the business community starts to boycott Japanese goods, they must first ask whether to inspect and whether to seize the goods. If merchants are willing to boycott automatically, there is no need to ask whether to inspect or whether to seize the goods. These two sentences can already prove that the merchants do not sincerely boycott Japanese goods. Before the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association started inspecting Japanese goods, the Japanese goods piled up in the Shanghai warehouses had already been taken away. Many people say that merchants do not talk about nationalism and only know how to make personal fortunes. This kind of criticism cannot be said to be completely wrong. Now, we can only earnestly advise the business community to discover their conscience and not sell or transport Japanese goods automatically, then the boycott will be effective. It is not effective to force merchants to boycott. If there is a boycott plan, after five or ten years, Japanese goods will naturally be eliminated without boycott.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Pudong Procuratorate Seized Japanese Goods <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Protect Unscrupulous Merchants Will Be Punished</p>
<p>The Pudong Procuratorate of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee found more than 3,000 packages of Japanese goods, potato flour, also known as Dong Sheng flour, in the Yuanlai Warehouse, Lujia Ferry, Pudong on the 15th of this month. It immediately reported it to the Investigation Section of the committee and intended to detain it. After the Investigation Section forwarded it, it immediately sent two specialists to the warehouse to verify that it was Japanese goods. Then, the Investigation Section ordered the district to detain all 3,000 packages of the goods and intended to transfer the goods to the Gongda Warehouse for storage at about 6 pm. Suddenly, a certain Shao came out to interfere, claiming to be a member of the Anti-Japanese Association, intending to protect unscrupulous merchants and prevent transportation, and uttered insulting words and scolded the inspectors. The situation was turbulent and unreasonable. Later, the inspector found out that there was no Shao in the executive committee of the Anti-Japanese Association. He was obviously posing as a swindler, so he immediately added a painful rebuke and intended to detain him for handling. The certain Shao knew that he was in the wrong, so he begged again and again and was willing to hand over the obstruction process in writing to the office for forwarding to the Anti-Japanese Association for discussion. At that time, the office allowed the request because the certain Shao was the person in charge of a certain trade association and urged all the inspectors to continue to transfer the goods to the Gongda Warehouse. At the same time, it reported the case process to the Anti-Japanese Association for verification. It is heard that the Anti-Japanese Association intends to submit it to the Executive Committee for discussion and give the certain Shao a serious punishment to deter wrongdoers.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Progress of the Automatic Establishment of a Fine Yarn Factory <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Talk by Xie Weiqing, Director of Preparation</p>
<p>Since the knitting industry in this city advocated the policy of automatically establishing a fine yarn factory and implementing the policy of goods for goods, it has been deeply sympathized by all parties and the progress has been extremely smooth. According to Xie Weiqing, director of the fine yarn factory preparation, it is imperative for our country to establish a fine yarn factory at present. I personally went to Europe and the United States last year to conduct on-the-spot investigations. The most advanced textile machinery is in the UK. In the future, the fine yarn factory in our industry should also carefully select purchases.

<p>News After the Weisen Steamer Ran Aground Yesterday</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Kuang Sang Steamer sailed from Shanghai to Shantou and Hong Kong at 4 pm on the 8th of this month. It has been seven days since then and there has been no news. The company's ship, together with the British warship, searched along the way and found no trace. It is expected that it encountered strong winds on Sunday night and either had an accident or drifted to a remote beach with no way to communicate with the outside world. The ship was carrying 2,900 tons of cargo and had 50 crew members. The number of passengers is unknown because the tickets were sold by the compradors. The ship was 2,283 tons and was built in 1902.</p>
<p>It was also reported that after the company's Weisen Steamer ran aground in Nanguan, news was received yesterday that the hull had tilted and there was a danger of cracking. There are still several crew members on board. The Fuson has already loaded food and went to provide relief and search for Kuang Sang along the way.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Shanghai Shipping Merchants Petition for Exemption from Zhejiang Province Water Conservancy Expenses <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association recently sent telegrams to the Civil Affairs Department and Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating that, according to a joint statement from member shipping companies operating in Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Construction Department proposed levying a surtax of 10% on all provincial steamboat, passenger ship, and cargo tickets to be used as water conservancy funds for various districts. This proposal was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and circulated to various city and county governments with a public notice announcing implementation starting August 1st. All shipping merchants, upon receiving this order, were greatly surprised. It was noted that the shipping business has been declining in recent years. Due to the exchange rate with the gold pound, the prices of various materials have skyrocketed. In addition, rice prices are high, and crew wages and food expenses have increased many times over the past. In terms of income, the industry has been affected by foreign ships and trucking, not only preventing any increase but also causing a daily decline. This environment has left the industry in a precarious situation, on the verge of collapse, with hardships difficult to describe in detail. Fortunately, the provisional constitution stipulates that private shipping businesses should be encouraged and protected. It is hoped that the government will abide by these provisions and provide as much support as possible for development. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, after ceasing the collection of "Zhenjuan" donations, issued an order for private shipping businesses to collect a 10% surtax for water conservancy funds, without specifying a time limit, which has aroused public concerns. The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that the surtax is collected from passengers and merchants, and that shipping merchants are merely collecting agents, which will not affect their business. This is due to a lack of understanding of the commercial situation and a failure to consider the facts. The steamboat business in Zhejiang Province is already like a spent arrow, with cargo and passenger traffic declining daily. If passengers and merchants are forced to pay the surtax, they will inevitably look elsewhere, either abandoning us for others or abandoning boats for land. Even a meager attempt to survive will be impossible, and the impact on the shipping industry will be significant. Moreover, water conservancy is a local public service and should be funded by local areas. It is unfair to solely burden passengers. Furthermore, this surtax is not stipulated by central laws and regulations, and shipping merchants are not collection agencies, making it inconvenient to collect. If passengers are unwilling to pay, how will they cope? Therefore, it is truly difficult to collect the surtax. Based on the above reasons and facts, all shipping merchants find it impossible to comply with the Zhejiang Provincial Government's decision to order merchant ships to collect a 10% surtax for water conservancy funds. It is requested that the association telegraph for its cancellation to maintain the shipping industry. The association has reviewed the above and found the statements to be factual and reasonable. Therefore, we urgently appeal, humbly requesting your understanding and approval for cancellation, so as to allow the industry to survive. We await your orders with apprehension.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Yu Hede, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association</p>

<p>The City Booksellers' Association recently received a report that He Junfu, a native of Shaoxing, formerly worked as an apprentice at the Qunxin Bookstore in Danfeng Lane, Guling Road. Before long, he secretly copied the directory of addresses of overseas Chinese in various regions of the South Pacific Islands, both domestic and foreign, and ran away from the store. He secretly rented a kitchen at 266 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, and falsely established the Unified Books Company. He reprinted the catalogs of various bookstores in the city, which were advertised at low prices, and widely distributed them to overseas Chinese in various regions. The overseas Chinese, far away in foreign lands, did not carefully examine them and sent remittances to purchase books, only to be deceived in large numbers. The association believes that this matter is related to obstructing the cultural business and credibility of the industry with overseas Chinese. It has reported the situation to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and requested it to consult the Public Security Bureau and the British and French Concessions to strictly arrest the suspect and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>A self-selling rice boat owned by Tao Bosheng from Pudong recently purchased more than 200 dan [unit of dry measure] of rice in the Songjiang area. Seeing that the Shanghai market had slightly recovered, he rushed to Shanghai to sell it as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, a gale broke out a few days ago. Tao's boat, loaded with rice, was anchored in the Southern Huangpu River for two days, but the wind did not subside. Tao became extremely anxious, fearing a loss in price. He ordered his crew to set sail. However, the boat ran aground on a sandbar in the Tagang area of the Southern Huangpu River due to the strong wind the previous morning. All six people on board fell into the water. Four of them were rescued by fishing boats. Tao's father and another crew member are missing, presumably drowned. The capsized boat is now lying sideways on the beach. The rice on board was washed away by the wind and waves, leaving only the hull. The loss of the boat and rice is estimated at five to six thousand yuan. Moreover, Tao's father and the other crew member are presumed dead, causing Tao great distress. Yesterday, he hired a boat to salvage the boat and search for the bodies of his father and crew member.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Completion of Automated Telephone Lines on Route Pichon and Route Hweisan <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>New Lines in Use Since Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's construction of automated telephone exchanges in the Route Pichon and Route Hweisan districts has been completed simultaneously. All 3,400 subscribers in the Route Pichon district and 1,900 subscribers in the Route Hweisan district were switched to automated telephone service after midnight on the 15th. This eliminates the inconvenience of calling for an operator. The conversion of telephones to automated service in Shanghai has taken another step forward.</p>
<p>Reception for the Press The Shanghai Telephone Company's new exchanges on Route Pichon and Route Hweisan were switched to new lines at 1:00 AM on the 16th. The company gave a reception for the press at the new exchange on Route Pichon at 2:00 PM on the 13th, where staff member Fan Ningshou accompanied them on a tour of the various departments: (1) The basement is the entry point for the ground lines. (2) The testing room can immediately calculate the location of an obstacle if an obstacle occurs, or it can emit a sound to remind users to return the handset to the machine if they forget to do so. (3) The power room uses AC electricity from an electric power plant and transforms it into 48-volt DC electricity. (4) The battery room uses stored electricity to continue generating electricity when an external power interruption occurs. (5) The air conditioning room is specifically designed to regulate temperature to keep each part warm in winter and cool in summer and to protect the equipment. (6) The switching room upstairs is currently being prepared for line changes. The procedure on the night of the 15th only took a few seconds.</p>
<p>Converting Line Heads The procedure for converting manual switchboard telephones to automated telephones is extremely burdensome, more than doubling the difficulty of installing new telephones. Therefore, the company has been preparing for several months. Even for the overnight switch of the switchboards and conversion of line heads, a detailed work procedure was prepared in advance, with a detailed allocation of the duties of each employee and the order of their work, totaling 82 pages. This shows the complexity of the procedure and the thoroughness of the arrangement. On the evening of the day before yesterday, all employees gathered at the old and new exchange districts and went to their designated work locations to complete the final preparations. Then, they quietly waited for the arrival of 1:00 AM. At 12:45 AM, the engineering manager issued a preparation order at the Hweisan exchange, and all employees were ready to go, holding their tools in hand. Then, the bells rang, and the scheduled time had arrived. The manager gave an order, and all personnel began work simultaneously, first cutting off the old lines and then connecting to the new machines. Before long, the conversion was completed, and testing work was then performed. If any minor shortcomings were found, their location was immediately identified and corrected. It was reported that the testing work continued throughout yesterday to ensure perfection.</p>
<p>Condition of the New Exchange The entrance to the new exchange is the power room, which is equipped with a generator, a power distribution machine, and numerous batteries to generate and regulate the current required for the telephones in the area. Next is the testing room, where all trunk cables leading to various areas and branch cables connecting to subscribers in the area enter the room from the ground and are connected to a distribution frame, from which they are distributed to the various parts of the switchboard. There are several trunk cables, each containing as many as 2,224 telephone lines, which are large and substantial. The distribution frame is equipped with fuses to prevent the switchboard from burning out if the telephone line comes into contact with lightning or power lines. It is said that subscribers also have similar fuses in their homes to protect their telephones. All of the testing telephone lines and the machinery of the switchboard are installed on the distribution frame and next to the switchboard operator's desk. When a circuit failure occurs, the switchboard operator can immediately detect its location and send a technician to repair it. Further in is the switchboard room, where the automatic switchboards are located, arranged in rows to replace the work of switchboard operators.</p>
<p>Automatic Switching There are tens of thousands of telephones in the foreign concessions. When a subscriber picks up the receiver and rotates the dial, the machine can connect to the called party without fail. Only an extremely ingenious machine can be so accurate and convenient. Readers would probably like to know how it works. When a subscriber picks up the receiver, the line finder on the switchboard starts operating under power and immediately finds the subscriber's line head and connects it to the line selector. At this time, the subscriber can hear a buzzing sound in the receiver, which is called the dial tone. After hearing this tone, the dial can be rotated. The line selector is a machine that automatically selects the required line. Currently, telephone numbers in the concessions have five digits, so there are four sets of line selectors. The first set of line selectors is installed in the exchange in this area and is divided into ten units, each connected to the telephone lines in one area. For example, the first unit is connected to the Central Automatic Telephone Area, the second unit is connected to the Lu Zong Area, the third unit is connected to the West Area, the fourth unit is connected to the North Area, the fifth unit is connected to the Hweisan Area, the sixth unit is connected to the Central Manual Switchboard Area, the seventh unit is connected to the Route Pichon Area, the eighth unit is connected to the Mintini Yin Road Area, the ninth unit is connected to the Fujian Road Area, and the tenth unit is connected to special telephone lines, which have only two digits, such as those used to report alarms to the fire department and the police station. Now, suppose a subscriber in the Hweisan Area wants to call the Route Pichon Area, whose number is "73725." Then, after the subscriber picks up the receiver, the line finder in the Hweisan exchange will immediately connect the subscriber's line head to the line selector and emit a buzzing sound. The subscriber then rotates the dial to the number "7," and the line selector will connect the line to the seventh unit of the first set, thereby connecting to the Route Pichon Area exchange. When the second number "3" is dialed, the second set of line selectors in the Route Pichon Area will connect the line to the "73" branch line. When the third number "7" is dialed again, the third set of machines will connect to the "737" branch line. When the fourth number "2" is dialed again, the fourth set of machines will connect to the "7372" branch line. This branch line has ten pairs of sub-lines. All subscribers whose first four digits are "7372" are connected to this branch line. Finally, when the last digit "5" is dialed, the "73725" telephone line is connected by this branch line. At this time, if no one is talking on the telephone, the bell will ring loudly to call someone to answer the phone. At the same time, the caller will hear a "burr-urr" sound, which indicates that the line has been connected. Conversely, if someone is talking on the line, the caller will hear a "burr-is" sound, which indicates that the line is busy. At this time, the receiver must be hung up, and the call must be made again after a few minutes. When we observe the above-mentioned connection situation, we cannot help but think that if many subscribers call various families with similar numbers at the same time, the switchboard will inevitably feel very crowded. However, according to the actual situation, this concern is unnecessary because the bureau has already taken precautions against this. For example, the Hweisan exchange currently has 3,000 telephone lines and is equipped with 360 line finders, which are connected to 40 line selectors. Moreover, once the connection is established, the line selector can be grounded separately. The average connection time for each line is less than 20 seconds, so there will be no congestion.</p>
<p>Unfinished Work According to people in the company, although the new exchange has been connected and put into use, there is still some unfinished work. During this period, subscribers may experience some difficulty when making calls. First, the new exchange is like a new machine. It is currently in the trial period, so there may inevitably be some things that need to be repaired. Second, the cables and wires in the old exchange still need to be dismantled one by one. At this time, subscribers' telephones may inevitably experience problems. However, the company will do its best to minimize the inconvenience to subscribers.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Rice Prices Fell Again Yesterday <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have been gradually declining. Yesterday, arrivals in Zhabei were very heavy, and demand decreased sharply. According to people in the rice industry, the Social Bureau's order to restore the limit price of 17 yuan within a week is expected to be fulfilled. This is because yesterday, the special polished rice (i.e., the highest quality white rice) had already fallen to 18.7 yuan, 2 jiao less than the current limit price of 18.9 yuan. No. 2 white rice was selling for 17.6 yuan per stone, No. 3 was selling for 17 yuan, foreign xian rice was selling for 16.8 yuan, ke xian rice was selling for 14.8 yuan, inferior rice was selling for 13.4 yuan, and tongbian glutinous rice (i.e., white yuan) was selling for 15.4 yuan, compared to 16.7 yuan in the previous days, a difference of 1.3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Homicide Case at the Fasheng New Hotel Solved <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Bodies of the Two Victims Examined Yesterday The French Police Solved the Case Quickly</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wang Xiji, who claimed to be from Zhenjiang and wore a white short shirt and pants, went with a friend to Room No. 2 downstairs at the Fasheng New Hotel at 113 Rue Massenet in the French Concession and paid the room fee. He then went out. At 7:00 PM, he returned to the hotel with five friends, entered the room, and closed the door to talk. Twenty minutes later, a burst of gunshots suddenly rang out in the room, about twenty or so. After the gunshots stopped, four people in the room were injured. Wang Xiji, who had come to open the room first, and one other person rushed out the front door and fled south with the three people who had been standing outside the door as lookouts. The hotel then reported to the police station, which sent detectives to take the four injured people by car to the Renji Hospital. Two of them died from their critical injuries before they could be treated. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to the hospital to inquire about the names of the injured. One was named Zhong Ziqing and the other was Chen Yiming. According to Zhong, one of the dead was named Xia Yongsheng and the other was surnamed Xue. The bodies of the two victims were taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for examination. The details of the examination were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. However, the identities of the two corpses could not be determined. Yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court and asked Judge Lou Guanxian, forensic doctor Wei Ligong, and clerk Zhao Yifen to come to examine the bodies at 10:00 AM. The names of the two bodies were difficult to distinguish. It was examined that the smaller corpse had four bullet wounds in the right chest, right arm, left leg, and left foot, and the taller corpse had three bullet wounds in the right forehead, left back of the neck, and left side. After clarifying the examination, the judge took his seat, and the detective reported the previous situation and presented the 14 shell casings and two bullets found at the scene of the incident. According to the hotel owner, Wang Jiemei, and the tea server, Zhang Rongsheng, the judge, after verifying the information, declared that Xia Yongsheng and the person surnamed Xue were indeed killed by gunshot wounds and that the murderer was at large and should be arrested and brought to justice by the police. The judge then handed the bodies over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. After the examination, the police took photos of the bodies for record purposes. In the afternoon, Xia's wife came to the morgue and identified the shorter body as Xia Yongsheng. The detective in charge of the case then took Xia's wife to the police station for further investigation. It was also learned that after this case occurred, the French police station's special task force detectives, based on what the injured person said about the murderer's address, immediately went out to arrest the suspect, but there were no clues until dawn. At 7:00 AM, an informant reported that the case was committed by Yan Er, a well-known bandit leader from Jiangbei. Yan lived at No. 16 Chongde Fang, Minguo Road, outside the Xiaobeimen, etc. At 7:30 AM, detectives Jin Jiulin, Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, and Mao Jingen led detectives from the general task force to Chongde Fang No. 16 by car. They only found Yan's friend, Dai Yunhong, from Jiangbei. According to Dai, Yan was hiding at No. 20 Tiancheng Lane, Rue Joffre in the French Concession. The detectives then took Dai to No. 20 Tiancheng Lane, Rue Joffre, where they found Yan Er and his wife sleeping in bed. They were then arrested, along with his wife, Li, Dai, and several others, and taken to the police station. Yan confessed that he had colluded with the injured and dead people in Shanghai and Jiangbei to commit robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. This time, it was because his gang members unevenly divided the loot and were jealous of each other. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, he used the alias Wang Xizheng to rent a room at the Fasheng New Hotel and lured the four of them in to shoot them. The two people currently being treated in the hospital, Zhong Zhiqing and Jiang Yihan, i.e., Chen Yiming, and the two dead people were indeed Xia Yongsheng and the person surnamed Xue. There were also several other accomplices at large. The West Concession detective chief ordered them to be detained separately and ordered the detectives to strictly apprehend the fugitive gang members and bring them to justice for interrogation. He also praised the detectives for their rapid and diligent work in solving the case, and the detectives expressed their gratitude and left.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Cruelty of Zheng Yanzuo's Family's Wet Nurse <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Her Nephew Was Forced to Stop Working After Being Humiliated, He Committed Suicide by Poisoning, Still Unwilling to Accept Punishment After Three Months in Custody</p>
<p>Zheng Yanzuo, i.e., Zheng Xiaoxu's son, lives at No. 10 Hardoon Road in Western Shanghai and employs many male and female servants. Xu Yu, a woman from Yangzhou, has been a wet nurse in the Zheng residence for many years. She is usually crude and often quarrels with other servants. Even the mistress of the house is sometimes scolded by her. In November of the previous year, Xu Yu introduced her nephew, Xu Youru (41 years old, from Yangzhou), to the Zheng residence as a shop assistant. Xu is very honest and loyal to his work and is trusted by the master. He has saved 50 yuan over the past year and stored it with Yu. Recently, because he needed to use the money, he asked Yu for it. Yu only returned 30 yuan to Xu. On the 31st of last month, Youru accidentally broke a rice bowl. Yu immediately asked the master to fire him. The master thought it was unintentional and the damage was minimal, so he only warned him. However, Yu was very dissatisfied and slapped Youru twice in the face in front of the master and forced him to leave the Zheng residence that day. She also forced the other two maids whom she had introduced to stop working at the same time, and Yu also resigned. Four days later, Youru, unable to make a living, returned to the Zheng residence and begged Yanzuo to re-employ him. Yanzuo agreed. However, Yu found out about this and rushed to the Zheng residence at about 8:00 PM on the 7th of this month. She immediately twisted and beat Youru when she saw him. The cook, Cai Jinrong, tried to dissuade her, but she left angrily and asked Youru to go to No. 985 East Yalu Road the next morning to reason with Youru's sister-in-law, Xu Yang. Therefore, at 8:00 AM on the 8th, Youru left the Zheng residence alone and went to his sister-in-law's place to meet Yu. After that, an argument broke out. In his resentment, Youru suddenly had a suicidal thought and went out to buy opium and secretly swallowed it. He returned to the Zheng residence at 11:00 AM. His colleagues saw that his face was very different and he was sweating profusely, but he said nothing. They thought he had heatstroke and quickly gave him acupuncture. At that time, Shen Yuanxiang, an old man who planted flowers in the Zheng residence, asked Xu. Xu only said the word "injustice" and nothing else. He then reported to the master, who quickly sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Foch by car. However, he was too poisoned and died at about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and ordered the body to be taken to the morgue for examination. At the same time, they ordered the arrest of Yu for further investigation. The day before yesterday afternoon, Detective Lu Gendi arrested Xu Yu and sent her to the women's detention center. The interpreter of the First Special District Court immediately asked the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, to rise and detail the above situation, saying that the police station was now prosecuting the defendant for the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 318 of the criminal law and requested that the court render a judgment in accordance with the law. Xu Youjin, the deceased's younger brother, also heard the news from his hometown and came to Shanghai to hire a lawyer to sue Xu Yu, requesting that the deceased be vindicated. Zheng Yanzuo then appeared with witnesses Shen Yuanxiang, Cai Jinrong, the deceased's sister-in-law Xu Yang, and the deceased's younger brother Xu Youjin, to testify to the above facts. When questioned, the defendant Xu Yu admitted that she had a quarrel with Youru on July 31 because he broke a bowl, but she firmly denied all other facts and hired a lawyer to defend her. After Judge Cheng Shangfeng ordered the lawyers from each side to debate, he announced in court that Xu Yu was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of using violence and coercion to obstruct the exercise of rights. The number of days of detention before the trial was allowed to be deducted from the imprisonment period at a rate of two days for one day. It is said that Xu Yu is still not satisfied with the judgment and intends to appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Scandalous Affair on the Water <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhansan's Debauchery on a Sampan, Wang Lindi Cries and Demands the Return of Her Virginity</p>
<p>A local man, Gong Ziliang, makes a living by running the Rongmingyuan Teahouse at No. 107 Caofang Street, Yangjing Town, Pudong. His wife, Chen, gave birth to a son named Changsheng, who is seventeen or eighteen years old and works on a small steamship. Since childhood, through a matchmaker, he was betrothed to Wang Lindi, a girl from the nearby Shengjia Alley. Lindi, now fifteen years old, works at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, Shanghai. Every morning, she routinely takes a sampan from Yangjing Port, Pudong, to the Lan Road Wharf on the opposite bank to go to work, so she is quite familiar with the sampanmen there. On the twelfth of this month, Lindi and her neighbor Pan Quanmei (who works at the same factory) boarded Xu Zhansan's sampan, No. 1368, at Yangjing Port to cross the river. When the sampan reached the pontoon set up by the Xiangtai Lumber Company in Puxin, Xu tied the boat with a cable and suddenly had illicit relations with Lindi inside the sampan cabin (the exact time is disputed by both parties and is unknown). After the act, Xu jokingly promised to give Lindi five yuan and Quanmei three yuan within a day or two, instructing them not to make a fuss, so no one else knew about it. However, Xu is a poor man and could not come up with the eight yuan. On the fourteenth, Lindi and Quanmei met Xu at the Lan Road Wharf and demanded the money. Xu could not pay. Lindi, having lost her virginity to Xu, grabbed his clothes and cried, demanding the return of her virginity. A friend of Xu's came to mediate and advised Xu to give her five yuan first. However, Xu had no money on him. At this time, more and more people gathered to watch. A foreign police officer happened to pass by and, after learning the whole story, took all three of them to the Yangshupu Police Station. Lindi was sent to Guangren Hospital on Avenue Haig for examination. Dr. D. Sousa issued a certificate proving that Lindi's hymen had been ruptured. The police station, as the case occurred on the water, telegraphed the Water Police Station at Weituoma. Detective Sun Agui and Deng Jiagen were dispatched to bring the three back to the police station. After a preliminary interrogation by the police chief, the defendant Xu Zhansan, twenty-two years old, from Jiangbei, who rows sampan No. 1368 for a living, stated: "At about one o'clock in the afternoon on the twelfth of this month, I was repairing the awning on my boat at Yangjing Port when Wang Lindi and Pan Quanmei called me to cross the river. When we reached the middle of the river, Lindi asked me if I had a wife. I said no and that she only had a mother at home and no siblings. She voluntarily offered to marry me and pulled me to engage in illicit relations. Afterward, she asked me for five yuan to buy clothes, and Quanmei, who was keeping watch at the stern, also asked for three yuan for keeping watch. I promised to give them the money in a few days. Today, they suddenly demanded it forcefully, leading to my arrest by the foreign police. That is the truth." Wang Lindi, fifteen years old, from Pudong, a child bride in the Gong family, stated: "At four-thirty in the morning on the twelfth of this month, I took the defendant's sampan with Pan Quanmei to cross the river to go to work. Unexpectedly, the defendant stopped the boat midway and forcibly embraced me in the cabin, raping me while I screamed for help in the middle of the river. Afterward, he promised to give me five yuan and Quanmei three yuan, instructing us not to reveal the secret. But the money has not been given to this day, hence the dispute," and so on. Pan Quanmei, fourteen years old, from Pudong, gave a statement consistent with Lindi's. The police chief, noting that the times given by the two parties differed greatly, one in the afternoon and one in the morning, dispatched the original detectives to investigate. Chen San, the sampanman of No. 1329, and Chen Xiaoer, the sampanman of No. 1990, testified that Lindi and Quanmei had boarded Xu Zhansan's sampan to cross the river at one o'clock in the afternoon on the twelfth. The police chief, having completed the investigation, summoned Chen, Lindi's aunt, to the police station yesterday to take Lindi and Quanmei home temporarily. The defendant was detained in the detention center to await today's (17th) summons of witnesses to be sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Braid Caught in Machine, Severe Injury Leads to Death</p>
<p>Liu Guizhen, a seventeen-year-old female worker from Taizhou in the combining room of the Huafeng Cotton Mill in Wusong Yunzaobang, accidentally got her braid caught in the belt of a machine in the machine room at about four o'clock yesterday afternoon. The machine was running, and in an instant, the flesh under her hair was completely separated from her skull. Blood gushed out, a gruesome sight. Liu immediately lost consciousness. Fellow workers, upon seeing this, immediately stopped the machine and reported it to the personnel department, who urgently sent the injured person to the Haibin Public Hospital on the Outer Bund. Due to the severity of the injury and the hospital's simple equipment, they were unable to treat her and prepared a vehicle to transfer her to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severe injury, the rescue was ineffective, and she died at about eight o'clock in the afternoon. Her fellow townsman, Zhang Yufu, and others telegraphed her family and prepared a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that an important improvement is underway in the port of this city. There are approximately eighty-four boat-mooring pontoons in the Huangpu River. Each pontoon has four anchors, each weighing seven tons, placed on the riverbed and tied down on all sides with numerous iron chains interconnected. Therefore, the total length of the iron chain used for one pontoon is no less than one thousand feet. If the water of the Huangpu River were drained, one would see a dense network of iron chains in the river, forming a long row. Recently, large ships have been entering and leaving the port in increasing numbers, and occasionally, they are pushed by the tide and break the iron chains of the pontoons. The cost of sending people into the water to repair them each year is no less than several thousand taels. Therefore, Mr. Green of the River Conservancy of the Customs Service has decided to replace them with the latest type of single-chain, single-hammer pontoons. Each pontoon will use only one giant chain, seventy-five feet long, with a giant hammer weighing eight tons attached to the bottom and buried twenty-four feet deep in the mud. The chain is as thick as a person's body, and each chain link is twenty inches long and over four inches thick, made of cast steel and rustproofed. It is purchased from the United States. The giant hammer is shaped like a square tower and is also made of cast iron by the Jiangnan Shipyard. The replacement project is currently being undertaken by the Ruirong Factory.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association previously forwarded a letter from over a hundred businesses, including Xie Mao Xing, on East Xihua Road to the Public Works Bureau, requesting road repairs. The Association received a reply from the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "In response to your letter of June 13, forwarding the letter from Xie Mao Xing and other businesses requesting the Bureau to repair East Xihua Road and pave it with asphalt to prevent dust and improve sanitation, we have investigated and found that the road is currently being planned for widening, from the original forty-foot road surface to sixty feet. Before the widening design is completed, the repair work will be temporarily delayed. Currently, the widening work is largely completed and repairs can be carried out next spring. The entire road is currently constructed of crushed stone with asphalt paving. In response to the proposal to change it to a cement road base with asphalt pavement before the repairs are carried out, we hereby reply to you."</p>
<h3 id="e179">An Amusing Incident of Japanese Mistakenly Beating Japanese <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>At 11:15 PM the night before last, at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Shiqing Road, more than ten Japanese people carried a paper-crafted lantern boat about seven or eight feet long, inscribed with "Western Maru" in large characters, adorned with lanterns and playing gongs and drums, passing by the entrance of Shudeli Lane. Inside the lane was the China Dyeing and Finishing Company. Workers of the company were relaxing at the entrance of the lane. A worker named Hosokawa, from Nagasaki, Japan, had been in Shanghai for many years, wearing Chinese clothing, a white undershirt, and speaking Shanghainese. Because it was night, he looked like a Chinese person at first glance. As the road had not been widened and was only accessible to pedestrians, the lantern boat accidentally bumped into Hosokawa. The Japanese carrying the lantern boat mistook Hosokawa for a Chinese person and punched him. Hosokawa fought back, and they exchanged blows, resulting in a brawl. After realizing Hosokawa was also Japanese, they let go. The Shiqing Road police station, under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched Inspector Li Tingzhang and officers to mediate. The Japanese people then dispersed. After an investigation, it was learned that the previous day was the Japanese Mid-Autumn Festival, hence the lantern boat procession.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I am writing regarding the news item in the news column of your newspaper on the 14th, which stated that the Ningbo Native Place Association has requested the City Government to stop the forced eviction of tenants from Lianyuan Lane. This statement is inconsistent with the facts and we request it to be corrected. After investigating, we found that due to the current disorganization and inefficiency, we believe that consolidation in one location is necessary. Therefore, we decided to repossess the house at No. 3 Lianyuan Lane for our own use as an office. On June 30, we sent a registered letter to the tenant of that house, Mr. Wang Maosheng, instructing him to move out by the end of July so that we could move in. This action is in full compliance with the Shanghai housing regulations, which require one month's notice. However, Mr. Wang has delayed moving out after receiving the letter. We have repeatedly urged him to move out by the end of July, as the matter has been decided by a public resolution. To date, there has been no response. Unexpectedly, upon reading the news yesterday, it was clear that Mr. Wang Maosheng had fabricated and falsely reported the incident. In addition to investigating the facts and conducting further negotiations, we specifically request your newspaper to promptly correct this. With best wishes, Zheng Yunfang, August 16.</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Nature and Purpose of the Pacific International Studies Association by Chen Liting <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>In recent centuries, the center of gravity of international issues has gradually shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific, a fact that has become increasingly apparent and is recognized by those who generally understand the global situation. As the Pacific is the center of gravity of international issues, the countries surrounding the Pacific and the European countries related to the Pacific have a deep relationship with it. In addition, there are many problems and hidden dangers between countries, such as the increasingly fierce economic competition and unresolved political issues. Specifically, issues such as the US-Japan immigration problem, the problem of colonial rule, and various political and economic issues between China and Japan are all sufficient to cause great disputes and hinder world peace. However, a close examination of these issues reveals that some cannot be resolved by diplomats at a moment's notice. This is because their differences are formed by the cultural situation and social thought of their countries. Therefore, if we want to seek a solution, we should first have an international organization to fully study the focus of each issue and then use it as a basis for discussion so that the facts can be clearly revealed, and an appropriate solution can be found without being limited by preconceived notions and easily leading to a breakdown. The establishment of the Pacific International Studies Association is intended to respond to the above-mentioned needs. Now, it has been established for more than six years. The main purpose is to study the conditions of various ethnic groups along the Pacific in order to promote friendship and understanding between the various ethnic groups. The first meeting was held in Honolulu in 1925. In 1927, the second meeting was held in Honolulu. In 1929, it was held in Kyoto, Japan. The number of attendees at the first meeting was relatively small. In the second and third meetings, the scale was larger, and many diplomats, scholars, and educators from various countries were recruited as members. The scope of the agenda also gradually focused on political and diplomatic aspects. The purpose and establishment process of the Pacific International Studies Association are briefly as follows.</p>
<p>The work of this association can be divided into three categories: (1) Research... The selection of research issues is limited to the important issues discussed at the previous meeting, where there were conflicting opinions and no factual truth to rely on. (2) Discussion (3) Publication... Based on the results of the research, a detailed discussion is then held, and then various materials are published and disseminated in the hope of creating sound public opinion to restrain preconceived notions and emotional actions. The meeting period is once every two years. The discussion method adopts a round table meeting format. Each representative is not restricted by the meeting format and can freely express their opinions. Moreover, they participate in the meeting as private individuals and are not commissioned by the government, so they can speak frankly. This is the progress of the association's work and the method of discussion. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Dog Abuse Lawsuit</p>
<p>Hythe, England. A hotel owner had a foxhound. Short and stout. One day, he was accused of abusing the dog. He was brought to court. When the case was heard, the evidence was presented. On one hand, the dog was brought to court. The leash was removed. Unexpectedly, the dog was very happy to see its owner and pounced on him, wagging its tail and licking his face. The judge considered this a sign of affection between man and dog. The evidence of abuse was completely overturned. The dog owner was immediately released.</p>

<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Ocean production is a great natural advantage. If the methods are correct, it is inexhaustible and inexhaustible. In the past, Guanzi revitalized the salt industry in Lu, leading to the prosperity of Qi. To this day, England and Japan are the leading fishing nations in the world, with annual production of over 12 million tons. Russia has 11 million tons. The United States produces less, but still 1.2 million tons. The Japanese rely heavily on fish as a staple food. More than 1.5 million people are engaged in fishing. There are over 20,000 steam fishing vessels and 380,000 ordinary fishing boats. Every year, the fish trade with China amounts to over 30 million Japanese yen. Looking back at our country, there are only six aquatic product schools. With the exception of two fishing vessels each in Guangdong and Zhejiang, the rest are old-fashioned fishing methods. The underdevelopment of aquatic products has a long history. Yesterday, I passed through Dinghai and visited the Zhejiang Vocational School of Marine Products. The marine products were extremely abundant. I was endlessly interested in the guidance and explanation of Jin Mingzhao, the principal of the school. I will describe several of them below to know the wonders of the animal kingdom of the sea.</p>
<p>Abalone. Originally named Fu, it belongs to the mollusk family. The shell is oval. It has feet to attach to the rocks. The shell only has one side, which is very strong. There are several holes on it. Cuttlefish is its enemy, because cuttlefish has many claws. It presses its claws on the shell holes. The air does not circulate, and the abalone suffocates and dies, and then eats its meat.</p>
<p>Flying fish. Only a foot long, the body is slender and round. The Zeppelin airship is modeled after its style. It has two wings on its back. It can fly out of the water for more than ten feet, but it cannot go far. There are birds on the sea that specialize in eating this fish, so it sinks. There are also enemy fish in the sea. It flies out of the sea to defend itself when encountering enemies.</p>
<p>Eel, commonly known as Shan. The body is long, cylindrical, and the tail is slightly flat. There is a lot of mucus. The scales are fine, and the mouth is wide. The snout is dark black, and the abdomen is white and yellow. This fish is found everywhere. But its source of growth has not yet been detected by any country in the world. If we can trace its roots and discover its source of reproduction, it will be enough to cause a sensation in the world of natural history.</p>
<p>Whale. It is the largest animal in the world. It looks like a fish, but it is actually a mammal. The large ones can be as long as eighty or ninety feet. They mostly live in the North Pacific. In the autumn, when the north is severely cold, they migrate south with the tide. They are found along the coast of Shandong. Its front limbs are all fin-shaped, and it has no hind limbs. The tail is flat. The nostrils are on top. It floats on the water from time to time and exhales air, which looks like a spray. Ordinary people do not observe it. Because of its large size, it is thought that it must have a large appetite. However, in fact, it is the opposite. Its throat is very narrow, less than two inches wide. Usually, it only eats plankton in the sea. It cannot swallow fish larger than a foot.</p>
<p>Other things, such as where there are sea coconuts, there are sea corals. Jiang Yaozhu belongs to the shellfish family, not the fish family. There is also a kind of fighting fish, which is bright and lovely. It is known that besides cockfighting and bullfighting, there is also fighting fish. At present, our country is paying little attention to it. In European and American countries, it has long become a gambling game.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Coffee Musings <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yanyu</p>
<p>Coffee is a tropical plant. It is mainly produced in Africa, followed by South America. It needs to be refined before it can be used as a beverage. In the early days, only tropical natives liked to drink it. Later, as overseas trade flourished, it spread all over the world. As for today, the trend of drinking coffee has become widespread among all races in the world. Those who like it often become addicted to it, just like smoking and drinking. Now, I have collected some interesting anecdotes about coffee from overseas and woven them into this article for your reading pleasure.</p>
<p>African natives are addicted to it. African natives have been drinking coffee for the longest time. It has been more than 600 years of history. It was invented in the early 14th century. Although the way of drinking has undergone countless reforms, the natives' addiction has never changed. Africa is located in the tropics, where it is hot all year round, and noon is especially unbearable. Therefore, the natives are mostly lazy. They like to lie naked in the shade of palm trees to spend the day. They only get up in the evening. Then they gather to sing and dance under the moonlight and starlight, and drink coffee to their heart's content. With a cup in hand, they forget everything. They have the air of not being inferior to a king facing south.</p>
<p>Popular in London, England, very early. England was in the 16th century, when Queen Elizabeth was in power. She actively developed overseas trade and opened the way for today's imperial colonies. At that time, coffee and tea began to be imported from Africa and China. However, the quantity was small, and few people drank them. However, it was popular among the royal nobles of London as a rare drink. There is also a small anecdote in between, which is still passed on as a topic of conversation among the British people. Queen Elizabeth loved literature and promoted it wholeheartedly. At that time, the great playwright Shakespeare was especially favored. One day, he was summoned to the inner court. Because his answers were satisfactory, he was specially rewarded with a cup of the finest coffee for royal use. Shakespeare, overwhelmed by the honor, drank it all in one gulp. After a while, he tasted the strange bitterness. He frowned and said nothing. The Queen, seeing this, could not help but smile. This was the first time Shakespeare had drunk coffee.</p>
<p>Coffee shops all over Baghdad. Arabs are naturally fond of listening to stories, and the habit of drinking coffee is also popular. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, is a magnificent city full of oriental flavor. If we travel to that place, we can see that there are many coffee shops on the streets and in the markets. According to a survey by the Englishman Wilbur in the summer of 1930, there were as many as 250 coffee shops of all sizes in Baghdad. If you go to each coffee shop, you will always find an old Arab or Turk sitting high on a couch, telling stories to the audience. The fragrant aroma of coffee and tobacco fills the room. The people of the subjugated country are drunk. After sighing, they use coffee and tobacco to relieve their depression. This scene is truly poetic.</p>
<p>Washington Irving's great addiction. The late American writer Washington Irving was a prolific writer and well-known for his writing. He loved to travel throughout his life, especially to visit historical sites. He traveled all over Europe, especially lingering in Spain. In his later years, he was appointed by the US government as the Minister to Spain. Therefore, he had deep feelings for the Spanish people. According to Spanish folk legends, Irving was addicted to coffee throughout his life. After living in Spain, he became more assimilated by the local people. The Spanish people's addiction to coffee is far greater than that of the Americans. Ordinary people drink coffee after meals at a certain time. But Irving needs to drink it when he wakes up in the morning. Coffee accounts for almost nine-tenths of his drinks all day long. Whenever he is writing, the coffee pot is indispensable. Otherwise, his thoughts will become slow.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Admirable Old Ways of Wei Ruosou <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>Wei Ruosou, an old gentleman from Hengyang, is over seventy years old. He has devoted himself to the six arts, and his calligraphy and painting are profound and not outdated. He had a close friendship with his late teacher, Zeng Nongran, and obtained something that had never been seen before. Last winter, Mr. Zeng and Ruosou were about to hold a birthday banquet together for their 70th birthdays. However, Mr. Zeng suddenly passed away before his birthday. Ruosou was deeply saddened. The toast was immediately interrupted. Remembering that when Mr. Zeng was seriously ill, he wrote a small landscape painting for Ruosou, with a poem inscribed on it: "The Juexi River flows around the pavilion, and the hand-planted garden willows have become embankments. After the calamity, there is still my humble house. I regret that I have not been able to return every year." This painting was Mr. Zeng's last work, which shows the deep friendship between the two old gentlemen. Recently, Mr. Wu Jianqiu sent a collection of poems from Beijing to celebrate Ruosou's birthday, as well as a postscript poem: "I grew up with you during the Xuanhe period, and we are truly like old men who have silenced their zithers. I cannot believe that time flies by like a rolling wheel. It is pitiful that my ambition still depends on the mausoleum. The horizontal forest is worm-eaten, and there is no complete leaf. After being drunk, the dragons and snakes are all over the reed mat. My teachers and friends are withered and I am old. No one understands my heart at this time. I often say that life is rare at seventy. I am happy to rest from the dust. Hearing too much only adds to the burden of my body. Warmth and fullness have always been contrary to the Tao. I look at the remaining ink stains in the inkstone. Whose well is white, reflecting the thorn door? Is there anything else you know? The lonely crane will return three thousand years later." Mr. Ruosou's 70th birthday was on the seventh day of the eleventh lunar month in the year of Gengwu. Mr. and his forgotten friend Nongran passed away one day apart. Mr. Nongran unfortunately passed away several months ago. Mr. is saddened by the passing of his peers and stopped the birthday toast. His noble heart and ancient friendship are deeply admirable. I collected two poems by Lu Jiannan, which are not very well written, to express my congratulations from afar. Wu Yi wrote the book in the middle of the summer in the year of Xinwei. His poems are lofty and soaring, truly worthy of being passed down. It also shows that the friendship between Mr. Zeng, Ruosou, and Jian is not easily changed by life and death. When I was fifty years old last month, I was honored by the presence of Ruosou, who was old and had white hair. He was energetic and had a moving demeanor. His language was witty and meaningful. This autumn, on July 4, it will be the anniversary of Mr. Zeng's death. Ruosou also wants to participate in the memorial meeting of the Zeng-Li same-sect association. His ancient sentiments and noble friendship do not change even in life and death. Ruosou can truly correct the bad customs and superficial habits of the late period. (Instead of Repaying)</p>
<p>Correction: In the "Elegy for Xu Qishang, a man of the same year" published yesterday, the phrase "diao zhi" (to mourn him) in the seventh line of the poem was mistakenly placed on the ninth line and should be corrected immediately.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The Sana University has not yet opened. Outside its gate, under a tree, there is a free elementary school with a blackboard. A flat platform is made of cement. Under the big tree, there are more than ten children learning to read and do arithmetic. This is the Indian rural elementary school. The clothes of all the children in the class are not worth one yuan. The life is quite similar to the elementary schools I saw in Myanmar and Hungary. Walking between two trees, I saw two teachers teaching two classes of elementary school students. Each class has about twenty students. There are no desks, benches, or houses. Just two big trees, which can be called the Twin Tree School. Because Buddha Nirvana was also at the twin trees. The children each hold a pen and have a slate to sit on the ground. A sack is laid on the ground. Indian rural schools for common people are so simple. However, I also often visit various royal residences. Their arrangements are luxurious and definitely not inferior to Westerners. The harm of the class system is extreme. I visit the homes of wealthy people in major cities, and their arrangements are all exquisite. Every meal is like a Western meal at a Western restaurant in Shanghai. How poor the countryside is! Alas, I often see life on small broken boats on various rivers. I wonder what God is. Why did He create this Earth with uneven heat and cold, dangerous mountains and rivers, and unequal races? If not for Marx's grand vision, how can we make them all equal? It is truly not easy to say.</p>
<p>Indians' gambling seems not as serious as the Chinese. Their gambling tools are also different. In the park, I saw several Indians playing cards. The police came to watch, but did not interfere.</p>
<p>The village system in India: a village has a village chief, called Mukhi. Six or seven villages form a township, with a chief called Choki. The Choki has policemen subordinate to him. Six or seven Chokis form a town, with a Thana (police station). Ten or eleven towns form a TahsiI. Four or five TahsiIs form a county. The head of a county is about one hundred English miles long and fifty English miles wide. Below the county, there is a four-level system, also known as cities, towns, townships, and villages. Five or six counties form a Division. Four or five Divisions form a province. Provinces are either large or small. Indian village houses are quite solid, not as makeshift as those of the Burmese. Compared to the Burmese, Indians are like thousand-year-old pines and cypresses, with dragon scales bristling. The Burmese are like willows, with drooping branches that are charming and lovely.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>"Miss! The person who came downstairs is really strange!" As soon as Qiu Zi saw Miss Ding, she hesitated and felt it was difficult to say it directly.</p>
<p>"What's so strange? Tell me!" Miss Ding laughed.</p>
<p>"It's a woman who came, she said she is Mr. Lu's..." Qiu Zi said halfway, then couldn't finish.</p>
<p>"Why can't you say it clearly and straightforwardly? Mr. Lu's what?" Miss Ding also became suspicious.</p>
<p>Qiu Zi had no choice but to say, "The woman who came, she said she is Mr. Lu's wife...</p>
<p>She came to find her husband!"</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, Miss Ding suffered a major blow to her nerves. All her emotions were in chaotic turmoil, and finally she became somewhat dazed. Suddenly, she jumped up from the sofa and said loudly, "Is there such a thing?"</p>
<p>When Qiu Zi saw that the Miss's expression was not right, she knew that this matter was going to cause a big stir. But she had absolutely no way to comfort her Miss, she only said, "That's what the woman said, but maybe there are other reasons inside!"</p>
<p>"Is that woman still downstairs? Go and invite her in, I'll ask her myself to find out what's going on!" Miss Ding said calmly, but her hands and feet were somewhat trembling. She followed Qiu Zi downstairs, and Qiu Zi went to invite Xiao Rong's wife inside.</p>
<p>Like a flower, Miss Ding was found in Xiao Rong's wife's eyes. She still seemed to remember the scene of buying gardenias from her at the Suzhou train station. But she couldn't get angry, even though she thought the Miss Ding standing opposite her was the enemy who took away her husband.</p>
<p>Miss Ding asked with a trembling voice, "Are you Mr. Lu's wife?... Alas! Poor thing!... Why didn't I know sooner?" Miss Ding shed tears.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife felt very strange. Originally, women's tears are most likely to move people's emotions. Seeing Miss Ding cry, she felt even more indecisive, and just stared blankly at Miss Ding in a daze. After all, she also began to cry.</p>
<p>Qiu Zi brought tea in. When she saw that both of them were wiping their tears, she was also puzzled. She could only try her best to persuade Miss Ding, saying, "It's good to say things clearly. It's not worth it to make yourself sick!"</p>
<p>Miss Ding then reluctantly suppressed the sorrow in her heart and talked to Xiao Rong's wife in detail. Xiao Rong's wife then felt that Miss Ding was also a very good woman, but she was deceived by her husband, so she also suffered because of her husband. Therefore, she not only did not hate Miss Ding, but instead felt sympathy for Miss Ding.</p>
