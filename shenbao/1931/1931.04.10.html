<p>英政府邀請德總理與外長往游倫敦。其期已定於五月六日。據外電所云英之所以邀請德總理與外長往游者。蓋因英相曾屢與他國政界領袖談話。而獨未見過德總理。似雙方宜有一度晤會。以討論雙方有關係之問題。然同時又傳有英國艦隊往游德國口岸之議。雖其日期未定。而所游口岸已定基爾或威廉夏文。由此二事以觀。英德接近之精神。不難於言外見之。</p>
<p>自歐洲大戰以後。德國久處於受命之地位。原無外交上活動可言。然自法外長歐洲聯合之議起。而法德間有接近之可能。及至德奥税約之議。法國反對甚力。法德之眞意漸形顯露。正在此時。英國乃有邀請德總理與外相游英之舉。並有英艦游德之舉。德國之人。自然歡迎。而法國一不加以表示。此中消息。甚足耐人尋味者。雖不能謂英國此舉。即爲親德而疏法。然其不願與法取同一態度。以對付德國。則固顯而易見者也。故曰此次英德之現狀。歐戰後外交上變遷之初步也。</p>

<p>保鏢俄人中槍受傷</p>
<p>合肥李鴻章之子李經邁、昨晨在海格路遇綁、幸汽車司機眼明手快、從烟霧彈聲中、轉輪疾駛、始免於難、匪開三槍、一中風屏、兩中保鏢俄人、然後駕預停路旁之汽車逃逸、受傷俄人、經送醫院治療、恐有性命之憂、</p>

<p>邁在滬經營地產、極有聲譽、海格路三三三號布羅克賽肿合組屋ＢｒｏｏＫｓｉｄｅＡＰａｒｔｍｅｎｔ即其獨創之巨業也、此屋華名枕流公寓、清麗可誦、大厦連雲、夏屋渠渠、觀瞻之壯、得未曾有、李自居曰枕流小築、在公寓之西、門牌爲四四一號、花木扶蘇、頗饒園林之勝、名曰小築、實則巨構耳、李因宵小覬覦、已非一朝、出入必以俄人保鏢爲護、昨晨九時半許、駕自備之二四四號汽車外出、公畢返來、已在十時三刻左右、其車係由善鐘路方面開來、至地豐路口融圃相近、忽見有塌車一輛、横住前面、一挽一推、邪許相應、李車司機柏芙洛甫、即煞車相待、等其過去、　　途遇綁匪保鏢受傷　塌車</p>

<p>美國大美報記者强和氏。年事三十有三歲。在新聞界頗負盛名。採訪新聞之餘。入華僑之華光夜校。研讀我國文字。能吟詩。口操北方音。對於佛經亦有研究。高聲朗誦。知佛法無邊。足爲立身之本。常語其妻曼麗。謂將去國赴華入寺廟。長齋禮佛。其妻屢爲勸阻。詎强和竟於去年三月。隻身來華。至枋州靈隱寺訪方丈。求作佛門弟子。意至誠懇。方丈不能却。收留寺中。强和旦夕　經。宛轉動聽。所造已頗可觀。故日來游杭者。見靈隱寺中有一外國和尙。即强和云。</p>

<p>杭州西湖。吾人無不知之。至於閩省福州之西湖。則知之者罕矣。茲特舉以告好游者。湖在福州城之西。晉太康三年太守嚴高所　周圍十數里。蓋爲灌溉民田計也。在王審知時。大至四十餘里。其後漸就湮塞。湖三面環山。中浮兩島。一小孤山。一謝坪嶼。以飛虹橋步雲橋與陸地相接。入湖先經謝坪嶼。嶼中有西湖草堂。褒忠祠。澄瀾閣。燕喜堂。烟景樓等。小孤山在其東北。飛虹橋通焉。山有宛在堂。鏡湖亭。湖心亭。蒹葭亭等。又有開化寺。故亦稱開化嶼。湖畔多山。如貴安山。象佛。國山。白龍山。梅亭山。文華山。鹿坪山。大嘉山。靈光山。大夢山。鳳凰山。清泉山。洪山。黃山。末山。西禪山。銅盤山。五峰山。大鵬山。火峯山。馬鞍山。越王山。龍腰山。太平山。梅柳山。臥龍山等。不可殫述。名勝古迹。如三山書院。謝氏草廬。貴安井。雲　池。地藏寺。上湖尾橋。下湖尾橋。保福寺。玉泉寺。染厝壑鹿乳泉。遺愛亭。宋鄭育故居。明余伯案棲隱處。臨水山莊。桐溪。李忠定公墓及祠。靈光寺。鑑池。怡然亭。西湖山莊。眞武宮。玉虚殿。朱子祠。毘盧閣。三義祠。遠翠亭。荷亭。墨池。養龍池。玉井池。香巖院。大撝塔亭。浴鳳亭。翠微精舍。洪山寺。四借亭。西隱寺。怡山館。泰山行祠。柳橋。石山境。楞伽寺。幻住庵。北禪庵。叢綠園。琴亭。仙井瀑布。玄沙寺普聞院。擢秀亭等。又指不勝屈。至於風景。則相傳有西湖十六景。曰仙橋柳色。曰大夢松聲。曰古堞斜陽。曰水晶初月。曰荷亭晚唱。曰西禪曉鐘。曰湖心春雨。曰澄瀾曙鶯。曰湖天競渡。曰龍舌品泉。曰昇山古刹。曰飛來奇峯。曰怡山啖荔。曰様樓望海。曰湖亭修　。曰洪橋夜泊。可想其勝概矣。將入湖先經李忠定公祠蓋祠宋丞相李綱。祠聯曰。進退一身關社稷。英靈千古鎭湖山。又題詩云。丞相祠堂草樹荒英魂終古怨汪黃。一生義氣磨難盡。九死殘軀恤未遑。歎自北人齎盜寇。永敎南渡感滄桑。岳王瘦死韓王老。史册於今恨共長。祠後則爲荷亭。亭三面臨湖。嵐光水氣。齊撲窗檻。夏日。紅藕作花。香浮几案。而數畝一碧。時露嬌紅有若絳衣仙子。舞於綠氍毹上。最爲可觀。入謝坪嶼有高樓危峙湖邊者。即澄瀾閣也。楊柳數十本抱之。每當三月草長。羣鶯齊嗁。宛轉悠揚。亦復令人心醉。過虹橋乃詣宛在堂。堂祀鄕先輩之能詩者。楹聯曰。桑柘幾家湖上社芙蓉十里水邊城。又曰。觀水觀山皆妙境。透風透月兩明軒。又曰。雲臥衣裳冷。山氣日夕佳。又曰。半郭暮霞明。望雉堞參差。認是家居社曲。一湖秋月碧。看烟波縹渺。宛然人在瀛洲。每逢令節。詩人多集於此。此湖中大略也。</p>

<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>陶朱公言。種柳千樹。可足柴炭。李時珍云。楊柳縱横倒順挿之皆生。因其易植。且易長大。而枝葉根皮。以及花蕊棉實。皆可爲藥。其用固甚廣也。清明植樹。此爲最宜。挿柳於門。殆與折柳陽關。用爲持嶒者同。蓋念作客異鄉。豈能爲十年樹木之計。種柳亦其一也。春取榆柳之火。正以枝條繁盛。日取不窮。而柳炭用爲繼後陰水之劑。其脱色滅臭之力。實較骨炭爲强。其灰。則含炭酸鉀甚多。以水浸出。可以浣滌油垢。以代肥皂。柳枝尤可削爲牙杖。剔齒甚妙。因其質軟。故無傷也。且含柳酸。能治牙宣。故常用之。柳之種類不一。蒲柳。即水楊也。枝勁可爲箭笴。杞柳生水旁。葉粗而白。木理微赤。可爲車　。不易折斷。其條可作箱篋。杭州西溪一帶。野生極盛。湖墅所售笆斗。即杞柳爲之。孟子所謂以杞柳爲桮捲者也。</p>
<p>予在梅雪路水邊種柳。三年即便成陰。七年高出樓際。每當上已前後。嫰日烘花。破蕊成絮。被東風所逼。則團聚西南牆角。滾滾成毬。取以實枕香軟可愛。不似木棉之生熱可厭。本草發明云。柳絮可以捍氈。代羊毛爲茵褥。柔軟性凉。宜與小兒臥尤佳。外臺　要。謂金瘡血出。柳絮封之即止。經騐方云。吐血咯血。柳絮焙研米湯服一錢良效。普濟方云。面上膿瘡。以柳絮　粉等分。調燈油塗之。集簡方云。患淋濁者。清明柳葉。煎湯代茶。以愈爲度。肘後方云。惡瘡不可名識者。柳葉或皮。不煮汁。入鹽少許頻洗之。此外洽療方法。多不勝記。足知柳之爲用甚廣。清明折柳。挿於門外。正以勸人携去。隨地挿種而已</p>
<h3 id="c183">印度遊記（十九） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>六號印度敎僧導游巴拉瓦那廟及尼乾敎神廟Parowanath　&amp;Jaima　Swetambar　Dadaii廟規模不甚大。而新鮮華美均用大理石爲之。附以花園魚池。到者必脱鞋。其内僧人甚少。但廟之清新。證明其在社會勢力甚大也。尼乾敎者。非佛敎非印度敎。另成一種。即所謂勝論祖師耆那是也。勝者最高之義或稱尼犍子（乾同）是音譯不同耳。尼乾子與佛同時。有佛説尼乾子受記經。是佛當時已許可之大乘宗派。但考其來源。實先佛出世。即有此古派敎也。禁慾甚嚴。戒殺生。聞某地尙有畜鼠者。以重生命爲生人之本。故崇拜母性。而拜母性生殖器。爲生命本源故。此其特異之點也。其宗派亦甚多。廟中多塑小像。但天晚未能見之。按尼乾子受記經。完全通世間法。略如儒敎之周禮矣。被佛攝歸佛敎者。今印人云。尼乾亦是佛敎之一派。其内容非不通印文字所知也。</p>
<p>於此有當知者。一國有一國之情形。若遊印度羅馬。而否認神者。猶之在美國而否認上帝。在俄國而否認馬克斯也。印度凡事不能離神。大至希臘多神敎亦受印度之影響。自畢達戈拉斯以至拍拉圖。均信輪　之説。畢達氏自信前生曾爲孔雀。據近人考之希臘受佛化也。不但希臘。猶太古代之多神。所羅門大闢王后宮女千數均信印度派多神敎。今回敎仍不離多神也。</p>
<p>巴米君告余。印度母性神甚多。而以凱利聖母Kali爲最大。乃公共之大母。保佑衆生者。從刧初以來。凱利聖母與魔王阿修羅Damon　Asuras戰而勝。人民子孫至今乃得太平存也。又有管智慧之女神曰史華拉底Swarawatio管財之女神曰雪西奈Laksmi及德戈Durga等甚多。余按此似希臘神話。如中國楚詞之女仙耳。不過作文之材料。並無關於迷信也。又辛漢君言印度男神最普通崇拜者。爲克利須那。女神爲德戈。因德戈亦與惡魔戰而護衆生者。最后勝利均在女神。與凱利正同。凱利之崇拜。僅孟加拉省耳。</p>

<p>— 洛湘</p>
<p>萬物都罩在黑幕裏、繁星還正在　熌着微笑時、我們兩人已給閙鐘從睡夢中擾醒了、一想到還没充分預備的英文今天要考、也顧不得連眼都難睜的倦意、就很快的了下床、</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們、「這時、管水灶的人、定還没醒呢、」我們只得把隔夜熱水瓶裏殘餘的温水、胡亂的嗽洗了、躡着脚步輕輕的走下了樓梯、看見宿舍的門還深銷着、就爬出了窗口到敎室裏開了電燈讀英文、</p>
<p>壁上的鐘、短針已漸漸的移到六點與七點的中間、天際也由魚肚色至大明、而我們、把英文温讀一遍後覺到飢餓了、决定到校外去買些東西來飽腹、</p>
<p>走到校門口、見門還没開、看門老頭還在被窩裏做好夢、我們就倚着門大聲的擊、似乎像有人在校外擊的一般、一會、聽得隔室有吐痰聲、曳麟聲、喃喃怨艾聲、門房老頭披着衣服出來了、我們急忙躱在黑魆魆的一角、看見老頭一面問是誰、一面把鑰匙開了開、走出校門見一個人影都没有、自言自語説、一没有人、難道是我自已耳朶作怪、擾人睡夢、但現在……」他回頭望着屋裏的鐘上、「但現在也將到七點鐘、校門也應當開了、」他就把門開大了又走到裏面去、我和蘭强忍着笑、靜靜的望着他、至此、連忙輕輕的跳出了校門、到校外、笑得已不能忍了、</p>
<p>大約是爲了春天的倦人、所以雖然這時已有六點多鐘、而馬路上除了爲生活而早起的苦力外竟没有人了、兩旁的店門還都緊閉着、我們徘徊了好久、當轉灣至大林路口時、忽看見馬路旁一個烟囱中有白烟縷縷冒出、我們急忙走過去、一爿小麵店、一個老太婆正冒在蒸汽中煑麵、中間放了幾張桌子、彷彿苦力般的三個人正大嚼、</p>
<p>「怎麽、」我不禁躊躇了、回顧頭去問蘭、</p>
<p>「去吧、我已餓得很了、我們不要有階級的觀念、」</p>
<p>我們毅然的走進去擇了靠牆的一張桌子坐下、老婆子急忙走來、殷勤的説、「店地又小又狹、小姐等竟肯前來、小姐等可是吃麵、」</p>
<p>「是的、兩碗、」</p>
<p>她就連忙去煑麵、又很小心的把清水洗碗箸洗了幾次、</p>
<p>假使有一小報館記者過這裏、那明日小報上又多一段新聞—女學生上小麵店吃麵、」我一面吃一面對蘭説、</p>
<p>吃好了麵、算結帳、只二十枚銅元吧了、我們付了一毛大洋走出、而老婆子連忙喚、「再有多呢、」</p>
<p>「不必了、」</p>
<p>老婆子乃把如驚如喜的目光送我倆的背影在晨　中消失時而還稱謝謝、</p>
<p>「倘若我們到著名的菜館裏吃一頓、就是給他幾毛錢、他們還不會知足、而現在、只是幾個銅元吧了、老婆子已快活得很了、」</p>
<p>「這是慾望跟着環境而增加的原故、」蘭説、</p>
<p>走進校裏、門房老頭正坐着吸烟、看見我個進來、問道、「小姐等昨夜住在校外的嗎、今天來得這麽早、」</p>
<p>我們只得忍着笑含糊地應了一聲、</p>

<p>— 蘭珠</p>
<p>虹、請你想像、我是怎様的興奮地、而且認眞地讀了你的來信、震感的心旌、在血與涙的交迸中像半空中飄蕩在狂風裏的斷弦、</p>
<p>我生活的情調、仍是像往日一様的彈奏、但恍惚的心境時時的在變幻着、整日是深浸在苦惱的旋渦中浮沉、虹、你説我感情脆弱得太任性了、這的確是一針見血的話、不知這是什麽緣故、一件稍稍不如意的事、就會逗着我偷偷的背着别人淌眼涙、記得有一天清晨中、接着你的一封掛號信、説你病在客鄕了、我還没有看下去、心頭頓時一陣劇痛、眼涙就源源的湧出來了、終於我伏在枕邊儘情的哭了、一直到下課、慧走進寢室來、我才强勉的忍住了眼涙、佯着病的敷衍她們有剌的詢間、虹、她們好像是早就知道似的、各人臉上浮起一抺冷冷的嘲笑、虹、我恨那時没有一個地洞、不能鐕下去、我不能受她們那様的侮辱呀、那時我眞是太難堪了、虹、像這様的小小悲劇、我不知演過多少、何時我才能解脱呢、</p>
<p>有時候想起生命的旅程、是緊緊的臨近黃昏了、被荆棘剌傷了雙足、再不能前進、又彷彿有擒人的猛獸進來、虹、從天外飛來了你、拯救了我這逼近死境的弱者、她是在你的愛護下獲着新生、</p>
<p>敬愛的虹、蒙你那般剴切地指導我、第一步廓清悲哀的雰圍、克服浮萍般的意識、第二步便用全副的精神去研究學問、虹、這的確是現階段的青年應走的路線、因爲幾年來、革命浪潮的洶湧、把許多的青年衝激得從學校裏出來、於是深深的陷落在時代的漩渦中了、到現在、從實際裏又感到了空虚、每一個青年都在這病態裏蔓延、到那裏去呢、這句話又普遍地流行在青年的口中了、實在的、現代的青年仍是徬徨在人生的歧途上了、尤其是失學這一事、使他們流浪、因了流浪而没有方法解决生活、最後而趨於自殺的、在各處我們都可以看到這悲慘的事實、</p>
<p>在這貧之乏的中國、固然不容易謀到生活、然而青年本身缺乏謀生的技能、這也是一個很大的原因、假使有眞正的科學常識、當這一切都在建築的中國是很需要的、虹、我現在有這様的感覺了、</p>
<p>虹、你的愛好文藝、誠然是你的個性、但是、你的環境也逼着你走上文藝的田園去、我還記得在去年的冬天你給我的一封長信中説、「珠、輾轉在人生的窮途中、文藝才是我唯一的慰安、」、虹、這正是感受到精神上苦悶的青年必有的現象、你不過是其中的一個吧、近來許多的青年荒蕪了正當的科學、迷醉在文藝的園裏、尤其是從人生征途上落伍下來青年、他們藉文藝來謳歌滿腹的哀愁、呵、這不振作的景像、是可怕的誘惑青年跌落到無涯的深淵裏、</p>
<p>虹、一年來你的流浪人間的悲苦、已經暗暗地在你給我的信中透露過、像你這様空度了時光、那渺茫的前程是更加渺茫了、我望你重新的過學生生活、雖然這是一個普遍的嚴重的失學問題、</p>
<p>努力吧、從夾攻下衝出來、虹、我在期待你、</p>
<p>到學校去、</p>

<p>— 雋者</p>
<p>德弟、我們大家都已很久很久的没有見到他了、德是非常用功的人、而且他的學校、又是像敎會學校一様嚴的學校、這些都是爲我們所深深知道的、但、雖是這様、可是我們總不能不有懹欵、因爲爲我們不相信在這快要兩個月的爲長的期間内、他就連來看我們一次、甚至寫一封信給我們的時間都没有、於是、我們也就由懷疑而竟着起急來了、要去看他的念頭、不知已起了多少回和多少天了、但終究也因爲我們自己都是些有職務在身的人、同時又因爲他的學校的位置、又是處在這様寫遠的滬西、因此我們也就没有機會、可以使我們如願以償的了、昨天、我們已聽説到了他的學校已放了春假、同時我們姊姊、春弟、小妹還有我、决定了今天去　葉家花園、所以我又想起了今天先去看德弟、同時好呌他和我們一塊兒去玩、</p>
<p>今天一早、春弟就起身了的、他在　洗手臉的時候、這様地催着我説、</p>
<p>—雋、你也好起來了、這兒上吳淞去、在路上也須要兩個鐘點呐、遲了怕德弟又要出去了、</p>
<p>哦、是的、這兒到吳淞去、雖僅短短三四十里路程、但乘火車去確實是須要兩個鐘頭、這裏、我們是不能不要感謝我們的路政當局了、我聽了春弟的這種似乎含有警告的意味的話、我乃怱怱地從床上翻了起來、草草地總算洗過了手臉、就開始上火車站去、</p>
<p>事情竟有如此不凑巧的、當我跨到車站門的時候、只聽到嗚的一聲、上吳淞去的車輛、已冉冉地駛出了月台、喲、這是只有呆望著逐漸遠去的它的背影、和還遺留在空中、嬝嬝不已的黑烟、靜待着要隔去一小時的下次列車啊、</p>
<p>度日如年、這句話、我覺得拿來形容我當時在車站上等車時的心境、這是再確當也没的了、</p>
<p>謝謝、爲我切盼着的上吳淞去的車輛、總算給我等到了、於是這猶如落在一口深深的水井裏的人、突然地見到了有人取繩子救他上來一般地衝進了車廂、不久也是嗚的一聲、車是開了、它灣灣曲曲地經過了許多鄕村田野、但我却並没有把這些美妙的春之郊野、一一地攝進了我的眼底、因爲這時、這是儘在想着德弟是否好好地在家呢、以及我將怎様地好使他歡迎我這個出其不意的去、</p>
<p>—人們是常常會負着他所希望的反面底事實而回的、我忘記了是誰、好像曾對我説過這様的一句話來、現在呢、固然我是負着了我所希望的反面之事實而回了、因爲當我到了德弟的學校裏、向他的同房間的同學一探訽之後、我知道德弟是隨著他們一組的德國敎授、上砲台灣去旅行了、於是我也只得埀頭喪氣地留下了這様一個條回來了、</p>
<p>「德弟、我興充充的來、爲的是要看你、並且滿以爲可以同你一塊兒的去逛葉氏家園、但誰在回去的途中、仍只　得一個凄惶惶的我呢、今天我是已再也打不起這股興趣去逛的了、並且我也相信他們—姊姊和春弟等、也都會有和我同一程度的掃興之感的、可是雖然是如此、但我此次的一來、總也不能算是絲毫無得的虚此一行、因爲我在你能走到砲台灣去旅行的一件事上看來、我知道我們先前的猜想你是病了、或是你有什麽特别的意外事情、這些、都已由事實的反證、令我們知道自己都有些神經過敏了、這様、今天我們雖然會不成了、但我們總算是都可安下了一個懸懸不定的心、現在我走了、祝你康樂和進步、</p>
<p>月×日×雋留條、」</p>

<p>— 安平</p>
<p>五　玄武湖之夜</p>
<p>神廟口和中央黨部很近、下了馬、便去找浩、那時天色已經很蒼茫了、没坐一息、浩同我們去吃晚飯、浩説最好上夫子廟、夫子廟、這塊地方、眞是我一位老朋友了、但爲騎馬後所襲來的波倦、使我噸得不想多走一步路、我説、「算了吧、」於是他引我們到了一家廣東館、記得在六七年之前、那時的丁家橋、眞是茺凉得可憐、但説在也就居然有着約模幾家像模像様的飯舖了、説那天的晚飯、眞不高明、但這不高明、是説店、不是説主人、不要説這主人請我吃飯、就是請我吃大餠、彼此也是毫無所謂的、</p>
<p>用過了飯、我説想上玄武湖去走走、那多半自然是因爲近、最　紀念我童年時候的春光的、便是這玄武湖、當我以前在南就的時候、一個春季、我去差不多總要上十回、是三四個人、一羣、買這麽兩三斤櫻桃、一隻小艇、在湖裏、突、唱、談天、紫金山的影子、遠遠地映現在湖水裏、明透、太陽撒下了幾千條幾萬條的金絲、在樹上、櫻桃上、泥土上、湖上、以及遊人的頭上、遠遠、樹叢裏、隱動着一把傘、傘下是爲微風吹動着的裙角、一首詩、豐潤門外、瀰漫了春意、驢子、洋車、足踏車、凑成了一片熱閙、在那時、那時的我、我什麽都不懂、懂得的、便是痴玩、痴吃、痴笑、</p>
<p>那天晚上月亮本該很好、但因爲天迷霧、所以大幕上祗現出了像一個死人的面色般慘白　湖上一切像都入於沉睡、靜得没一息聲響、從豐潤門出去那條必直的有着約摸三四米長的堤、兩旁、張着密密的樹枝、在密密的樹枝下裏、展現出一條出　的路、悠然、靜情、没人理會的艇子、像片落葉似的浮在湖面上、偶而、在一片朦糊的島上隱現出一點火、就如天邊一顆星般有趣、</p>
<p>起初我們在一起走、一排、像四個兵、後來、我願意讓自己一個人孤獨地徘徊一回、説「你們走前幾步吧」、於是我便落後三四十碼光景地、像消失了自己般悠然地漫步着、嘴裏有時是　着一些莫名其妙的詩句、有時則唱着、"Showbat"裏面的"Lonesome　Road"境是很黯然的、但究竟因爲北平去這事使我説不出的高興、所以感傷一絲也没有襲上我的心頭、</p>
<p>六　「吁」的一聲、驀地、將我一顆平和的心、兜底搗翻了、</p>
<p>我是定的三號下午七點鐘從浦口開出的那班特快通車的票、所以在三號下午兩點多鐘、我便和熹姪雇了車子上下關來了、因騎馬過度而所迸出的筋骨的傷痛、使我即使連一隻隨身帶的小皮箱都没有氣力提、那一次我能夠好好過江一直到上車、實在完全靠熹姪的帮忙、</p>
<p>那一天霧很大、不要説在下關江邊看不見隔江的浦口、就是在長子裏、恐怕十碼以外的景物、便完全模糊了、我們搭了三點半的一班小輪渡過江、江南江南就在那様彷彿不忍别離似的情境中、消失了、白鷗偶而在大霧中撲一回水、接着又不知飛到天邊或地角、在船上、我和熹都没有説一句話、這樣、一直到了浦口、</p>
<p>好容易才尋到了我自己的舖位、車是籃鋼車、這在南邊倒不曾有過、小小的一問、一共有四個舖、兩個上舖、兩個下舖、那時、當天那班自上海開來的特别快、還没到南京、車子上冷落得有些可怕、祇有月台上的一些運郵件、　包裏的脚夫、方在那裏八喊八呌地、才使整整的一個車站有一些生氣、</p>
<p>熹在我房間裏小坐一息、因爲他還要回城、所以我勸他就走吧、送君千里、終須一别、反正我當時心中也並没有什麽難過、他覺得我這話對、况且天色也並不怎早了、於是、和我握一握手、嘴裏説了幾聲Farewell、我送他下了車、站在月台上、直到他的影子消失在糢糊裏、我才將我的視綫、頸子、脚根、恢復了原來的狀態、</p>
<p>那時、一輛機車正從北頭駛進了站、「吁」的一聲、是那様的尖鋭、唉、眞是那様的尖鋭喲、像一聲雷、驀地、將我一顆平和的心、兜底搗翻了、自從上海一直到踏上津浦車、我的氣、永是那麽沉着、不曾有像那時候一様的承不住、我的靈魂有些像猛的受了一次劇烈的震動、有些飄浮起來、我遙望一回隱現在迷霧裏的南江、黯然地回踱了車箱、</p>

<p>一　胭脂與櫻唇</p>
<p>没有過花時吧、大概東國的櫻花季節全國上下都正在瘋狂般的閙着裏、不知怎様我和葇在路上走的時候、想起櫻花來了、</p>
<p>心裏這一嚮爲着人事的變遷、往事等於泡影、而　起春風吹皺池水様的悲哀、外面雖然是暖洋洋的天氣、想從禁錮般的屋裏、跑到外面去亂走一趟、幾次三番都是看到一生面目可憎的人退回來了、并不是不願同他們爲伍、想做一個清高物外的人、實在是他們的機智太有點怕人了、所以獨個兒關在房裏這様想、要出去不如待到深夜、深夜一切都靜了、我可以竚立街頭看溶溶的春夜月、又可以領略到月的美感、那鵝黃的月色洒在像一座大的墳墓的都市建築上、天地才回復了嚴肅與諧和了、</p>
<p>在今夜就把這種從未曾有的快感隨着呼吸呑入心裏面去了、葉也像一個行吟的詩人一様、伴着我從唐家灣出來、工廠裏面機器的引擎也愈見得響聲大了、四邊是靜了、靜了、只聽到機器的轉動得一起一落的聲音、</p>
<p>眞寂寞呢、這没有花的春天、我們寂寞的説出來了、想到日本的櫻花正是好看的時候、我們却没有福氣看了、雖然這裏也是春天、街燈仍是像冬夜的黯淡、昏黃、給與我們官能上的感覺是不會感到春天、路的一旁、稀疎地還站着幾個把肉零賣的雛姬、没有精采地、像一輪欲墜未墜的月、把聲音那様問路人打招呼了、旁邊每一個雛姬、都有一個顳　難看的老女人、我們都頽唐的走過去、過了許多這様難過的關隘、折至某某地方就被她們之中的一個向我們勸進了、腰肢軟軟的、眼睛清澄的、還有那嘴唇塗抺了胭脂的顏色、特别醒目地使人認識這是一朶櫻花片、呵、東國的櫻花、我們熟視無睹的抽脚走了、櫻花是要在夜晚開着的哩、</p>
<p>二　夜舂</p>
<p>兩個略略帶有一點　氣的年青人、從唐家灣一直跑到郊外去了、發現了一片荒原、有一條小小的河道、骯髒狹小簡直使人疑心到是一條溝、裏面銜頭接尾的小鵰子船排列着、我們就站岸上望望船中半明的燈火、可以窺測到他們此刻没有睡穩、因爲月亮有時閃入雲中去了、四野立時就像網幕了如織的烟霧、隔着一片荒原的犬聲也一隱一現的傳到我們的耳朶裏來、靠着河道疊起一層層的枕木、也同死屍似的放在那裏、這夜的境界又像有點颯颯的使人起着塞慄哩、埀老的樹枝也没有抽出他的嫩芽、也没着花、我們信步走着、走着、葇同我都感到一點口渴、想找一點水喝、可是茶店的雙扉這時全緊緊的掩上了、河裏的水又是那麽様的骯髒、如其能喝的話、我們也老早把水掬到手裏喝了、此時我們眞没有辦法、也没有説話、只是想到一個地方去找一點水的源泉、我相信我們此刻是在沙漠</p>

<p>Mo Te-hui Urges Special Committee to Travel to Russia</p>
<p>(Harbin) A telegram from Moscow on the 6th states that Karakhan told Mo Te-hui on the 6th that the formal Sino-Soviet conference should first discuss the issue of resuming relations, with trade and the Eastern Railway as continuing topics. (8th, special dispatch) (Harbin) The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered its consulates in Northeast China to establish propaganda departments and plans to set up a party newspaper in Harbin. (8th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Russia is sending Ramers to inspect consulates and party affairs in Northeast China, and he will arrive in Harbin within the month. (8th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mo Te-hui telegraphed Nanjing, urging Qian Tai, Xu Jianping, and other members of the Chinese special committee for the Sino-Soviet conference to travel to Russia as soon as possible. Qian and others are scheduled to depart around the 20th of this month. (9th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person stated that Mo Te-hui is actively engaging with Russian representatives in Moscow regarding Sino-Russian negotiations. If the Soviet Union is sincere, China is also willing to be friendly. However, since the Soviet Union is a country where industry and commerce are entirely state-run, while China is a country where industry and commerce are entirely operated freely by the people, it is not easy to negotiate a trade treaty between the two countries. Nevertheless, the relationship between the two countries is too deep, with railways stretching for about ten thousand miles. Failure to restore trade relations creates obstacles everywhere. Because the northeastern border is adjacent to Japan and Russia, diplomacy with Japan and Russia is the most important matter for the authorities. It is hoped that the people will pay close attention to the future issues of Manchuria and Mongolia. (9th, special dispatch)</p>

While sailing through Majiatao, it was discovered that the Red bandits were attempting to intercept and seize the ships. The warship urgently used cannons and machine guns to bombard them. The bandits also opened fire in return. After a fierce battle for a long time, the bandits suffered many casualties and fled into the interior.

<p>(Nanjing) The Dalai Lama is currently in Lhasa, and Lhasa has not yet been connected to telegraphs with various places. This time, the Dalai Lama's delegation claimed to have received a telegram from the Dalai Lama, promising to withdraw troops immediately. It may have been transmitted by the Dalai Lama's representative stationed in Chengdu, or by the representative stationed in Kangding. Based on common sense, traffic between Kangding and Lhasa has been cut off long ago. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the Dalai Lama is withdrawing troops. Foreigners say that all parts of Xikang have been occupied by 5,000 Tibetan soldiers. Furthermore, the Indian Shimla newspaper reported that Tibetan soldiers have occupied all of Kangding.

<h3 id="e11">Salt Administration Improvement Plan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Abolish the Salt Certificate System and Levy Taxes at the Salt Fields</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain legislator stated that the reasons for the previous decline of the salt administration were: (1) the abuses of the salt certificate merchant system; (2) inconvenient transportation; (3) military impact; (4) bandit disturbances. Salt is a necessary commodity for the people. The old system had a double monopoly of salt certificate merchants and salt field merchants, causing suffering to both producers and consumers. The new law changes to tax collection at the salt fields. Salt producers are free to produce salt and store it in warehouses, allowing them to freely buy and sell. According to economic principles, the price of all freely competitive goods will inevitably decrease, and the lower the price, the better the quality, which is truly beneficial to people's livelihood. As for the old salt certificates of the salt merchants after the abolition of the salt certificate system, those with verifiable evidence should be given discounted compensation. The approximate cost would only be four to five million yuan. Furthermore, the three million yuan of verification fees previously collected by the Ministry of Finance should also be fully refunded. The total would be no more than seven to eight million yuan. With the newly established salt tax, five yuan will be collected for every 100 kilograms. The Ministry of Finance feels that this is too little and plans to set it at eight yuan, which is far from the old tax of more than ten yuan per 100 kilograms. From the perspective of transportation and sales, salt has no substitute and does not need to rely on the existence of salt certificates to be universally available. As for salt fields with low production, poor quality, and high costs, the government can merge or eliminate them. During the period of changing the soil quality of these merged or eliminated salt fields, the livelihoods of the salt producers can be ensured by having them build dikes and do work, so that they will not lose their jobs. When the soil quality is changed and suitable for cultivation, these salt producers can be given priority in renting the land. The livelihoods of the salt producers should be more stable than before.

The currently accumulated portion is still stored in the Shanghai HSBC Bank. According to the exchange of notes, it must be transferred to the United Kingdom for the purpose of purchasing materials. However, there is no central bank in London, so it is planned to carry out a procedural transfer. The unexpired portion will be directly deposited in the Central Bank for safekeeping. How the funds borrowed by various agencies, bearing an annual interest rate of 5%, will be allocated to education in the future still needs to be discussed by the board of directors. Furthermore, the proposal to use the unexpired funds borrowed by various agencies as a bond issuance fund is also pending discussion. (9th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in diplomatic circles stated that there has been no progress recently on the Sino-Japanese treaty revision, legal rights, and other important outstanding issues. Because the current Japanese cabinet is pursuing soft diplomacy, there is no hope for a decisive solution to anything. Furthermore, in view of the Japanese political turmoil, the country is in a period of troubles. The Chinese side has not been actively urging the discussion of various outstanding issues. As for the issue of abolishing the Japanese cultural agreement with China, the Chinese side has appointed its committee members. Recently, among the specialists sent to Japan for inspection by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan, there are also some who will serve as committee members. They will first make informal contact with important figures in Japan. However, the Japanese side still has many objections regarding the number of committee members and the meeting location.

<p>(Nanjing) China's export tariffs have been inherited for a long time, and the annual levy is only more than 20 million.

<h3 id="e30">German Chancellor and Foreign Minister Visit Britain <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The British government invited the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister to visit London. The date has been set for May 6. According to foreign news reports, the reason why Britain invited the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister to visit is because the British Prime Minister has repeatedly spoken with leaders of other countries, but has not met the German Chancellor. It seems that the two sides should have a meeting to discuss issues of mutual concern. At the same time, there are also reports that the British fleet will visit German ports. Although the date has not been set, the ports to be visited have been set as Kiel or Wilhelmshaven. From these two events, the spirit of rapprochement between Britain and Germany can easily be seen between the lines.</p>
<p>Since the European War, Germany has long been in a subordinate position and originally had no diplomatic activities to speak of. However, since the French Foreign Minister proposed the European Union, there has been a possibility of rapprochement between France and Germany. As for the Austro-German Customs Union, France strongly opposed it. The true intentions of France and Germany gradually became apparent. At this time, Britain invited the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister to visit Britain and sent the British fleet to visit Germany. The Germans naturally welcomed this, while France did not express any opinion. The message in this is worth pondering. Although it cannot be said that Britain's actions are pro-German and anti-French, it is clear that it is unwilling to take the same attitude as France in dealing with Germany. Therefore, it can be said that the current state of Anglo-German relations is the first step in the diplomatic changes after the European War.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Determined to Resign</p>
<p>Urgent Selection of a Successor</p>
<p>Wakatsuki and Adachi Considered Top Candidates</p>
<p>Ruling Party Expects to Retain Power</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Japanese United News) Since Prime Minister Hamaguchi's re-admission to the hospital, although he has not expressed any opinion regarding his future course of action, his resignation is only a matter of time. The situation is extremely urgent, and government and ruling party officials are deeply concerned about the future. With Advisors Wakatsuki and Yamamoto and Ministers Adachi and Eki as the center, contacts with various parties have been abnormally frequent since this morning. An atmosphere of political change permeates the political world. The most important issue is who will be selected as the successor after Prime Minister Hamaguchi expresses his intention to resign. Currently, Wakatsuki, Yamamoto, and Adachi are the most promising candidates for successor, with Wakatsuki receiving the most support.</p>
<p>(Dentsu) According to Wakatsuki's statement to reporters today, although there are various rumors regarding the issue of a successor, it is best to maintain a wait-and-see attitude at present. Matters within the cabinet should be decided by the cabinet members and should not be discussed endlessly from the sidelines. I feel that I am not competent to be the successor and will definitely not accept the position.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Dentsu) Prime Minister Hamaguchi is determined to resign and is only waiting for the ruling party to select a successor before submitting his resignation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Dentsu) Concerning the chaotic political situation surrounding the issue of a successor, since Prime Minister Hamaguchi formally expressed his intention to resign, the urgent selection of a successor has become the top priority. The government is also anxious to stabilize the situation as soon as possible and may prepare for a general resignation next week.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Dentsu) Regarding who will hold power after Prime Minister Hamaguchi's resignation, the Minseito Party said, "Prince Saionji said that it is absolutely unacceptable to transfer power by force. Therefore, power will definitely not be seized by the Seiyukai. We are confident that the mandate will still be given to our party's successor." The Seiyukai said, "Observing the rampant corruption of the current Minseito cabinet, power will inevitably return to our party." They are paying close attention to the drastic changes in the current situation.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Date for British and German Leaders' Meeting Confirmed <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>June 5th</p>
<p>British Fleet to Visit German Ports</p>
<p>First Time Since the Great War</p>
<p>A Prelude to Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) After discussions between the British Foreign Office and the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister, it has been decided that June 5th will be the date for German Chancellor Brüning and others to visit Britain. It is reported that the idea of the German Chancellor visiting Britain arose from discussions between the British Foreign Secretary and the German Ambassador last month. Because the British Prime Minister has repeatedly spoken with political leaders from other countries, but has not met with the German Chancellor, it seems that the two sides should have a meeting to discuss issues of mutual concern. The British government's invitation to the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister has been received, but both sides are busy with government affairs, and it is not easy to choose a meeting date that does not conflict with government schedules. Therefore, it was not until today that June 5th was found to be the most convenient date for both parties. According to the current plan, the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister are scheduled to arrive in Britain on June 5th, spend Saturday and Sunday at the British Prime Minister's villa, participate in a reception at the German Embassy on Monday for British cabinet members and the diplomatic corps, and return to Berlin on June 9th. The German government and naval authorities are very supportive of the idea of a British fleet visiting German ports. The British fleet's visit to German ports is the first since the Great War. The date has not been set, but it will probably visit Kiel or Wilhelmshaven.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (National) The German political community feels slightly disappointed by the postponement of the meeting date because the French believe that the German-Austrian partial customs union is undecided until the League of Nations Council meeting. This postponement is tantamount to making concessions to the French.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Pessimistic Outlook for Anglo-Franco-Italian Naval Agreement <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 8th (National) After the British Foreign Secretary Henderson mediated the Franco-Italian naval agreement, the conclusion of the three-nation naval agreement was carried out in London. At this moment, the work has been stalled, and everyone in Paris is convinced that the plan has reached an unrecoverable state. Without divine help, the sloppy and superficial agreement will be completely broken and turn into a crisis for the European situation, making next year's disarmament conference even less likely to be established. The reason for the difficulty in reaching an agreement this time is that the comparison of naval strength proposed by the French Navy Department for this year and five years later is difficult to reconcile. According to France's calculations, France's naval strength this year includes all warships currently in service, as well as all warships under construction or already approved by the government for construction. However, the strength at the end of 1936 is only based on the warships in service at that time, and the numbers of other warships under construction or already approved for construction are not included. Britain and Italy strongly opposed this calculation, while French public opinion insisted on it. Therefore, there is very little hope for the future.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) British Naval Minister Alexander said in a speech in Hull today that the Franco-Italian agreement he had personally made in Rome and Paris was achieved with the goodwill and cooperation of the political leaders of the two countries he had met. He could not believe that this agreement should be allowed to perish. The British government will do its best to promote the implementation of this agreement and intends to implement this agreement through legal treaties in order to achieve two goals: first, to remove the real obstacle that hinders free and straightforward discussions on disarmament issues at the future Geneva World Disarmament Conference; and second, to transform the lack of understanding between France and Italy into a closer and more friendly relationship.</p>

<p>No Need to Refuel Mid-Voyage</p>
<p>Can Circumnavigate the World</p>
<p>Washington News: According to a statement from the Navy Department, U.S. battleships are now equipped with a new device that allows them to circumnavigate the world without refueling. All old ships from the war are now being remodeled, including a major improvement in the oil tanks, so that the battleships no longer rely on coal stations and can travel around the world with a range of 25,000 miles without stopping. The battleship Arizona, which recently carried President Hoover on a tour of the West Indies, is one of the ships that has just been renovated in this way. The Idaho, New Mexico, and Mississippi are still to be remodeled, at a cost of 30 million yuan. However, according to experts, when operating far from the country's territorial waters during wartime, too much fuel storage will make the ship heavy and difficult to maneuver. (World)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Han Fuqu Departures for Sishui to Suppress Bandits <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Chairman of the Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, Han Fuqu, returned to Jinan the night before last. He did not attend yesterday's (7th) Provincial Government Standing Committee meeting. At 2:00 PM, he convened a military conference at the headquarters. Those present included Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, Li Zongbi, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Zhang Yue, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and Wang Wanqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Shandong Militia Army, and Zhao Renquan, Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Shandong Militia Army. It is reported that the discussion concerned the deployment of troops to the front to suppress bandits, and the deployment of the militia army to defend the rear. After the meeting, he invited the directors of various departments to the Provincial Government to coordinate on matters related to the National Assembly election. After all the deliberations were completed, it was decided that he would depart for the front at 7:00 AM this morning (8th) to command the suppression of bandits. After the Provincial Government Encouragement Meeting ended at 6:00 AM, Han took a car to the station. Military and political dignitaries all went to the station to see him off. Han told reporters that he would get off the train in Qufu this time, transfer to a car to Sishui, and command the various armies to suppress bandits. The bandits in Mengshan were originally limited to be cleared by the various armies before the 10th so that they could be sent to encircle and suppress Baodu Ridge. Because the mountain is steep, it is necessary to surround it with a large army to make it easy to succeed. Last year, Commander Ma (Hongkui) went to suppress it once, but due to the small number of troops, he failed to clear it. This time, there are the Third Route Army (Han's direct troops), the Fifteenth Route Army (Ma Hongkui's troops), the 26th Division (Chen Yaohan's troops), and the Seventh Division (Wang Jun's troops), totaling more than 10,000 people. Because there are so many troops, if I do not go to the front to command, the action may be difficult to unify. Sishui and Feixian are the rear, and it has been decided to transfer the Southern Shandong Militia Army to make the front-line troops worry-free and achieve a complete victory. This time, the cavalry brigade of the Fifteenth Route Army, led by Ma Kui, has made the most contribution. The section from Linqu, Boshan, to Yishui was previously defensive in nature, and will also be used for suppression in the future, etc. Finally, Han earnestly instructed the directors of the various departments, hoping that everyone would work hard for the National Assembly election. Then he boarded the train, which departed southward at 7:15 AM. Wang Wanqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Shandong Militia Army, also followed the train. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Scriptures Stored in Hainan Temple in Yexian Were Burned <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Ming Dynasty Great Collection of Scriptures</p>
<p>Shandong Education Department Has Sent Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Hainan Temple in Yexian City contains a copy of the Ming Dynasty Northern Edition of the Great Collection of Scriptures (the Great Collection of Scriptures is divided into the Southern Edition and the Northern Edition), totaling more than 30,000 volumes. According to reports, only the libraries in Beiping, Mount Jing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong each have a copy, but they are not complete. However, the one stored in Hainan Temple is the most complete copy in China. Unfortunately, it has recently been burned, which is a pity. Because Yexian plans to establish a normal school training institute and borrowed the address of Hainan Temple. When repairing the houses, it was discovered that there were three houses full of books. At that time, they did not know that it was a valuable Great Collection of Scriptures and regarded it as old paper, and there was no house to move and store it, so they came up with the whimsical idea of setting it on fire. It is said that two-thirds of it has been burned. The Shandong Education Department has now, based on the report of Inspector Peng of the department, telegraphed the Yexian government to investigate in detail on the one hand, and sent Wang Xiantang, director of the Provincial Library, to investigate and reorganize on the other. Wang told reporters that he would depart within days. After arriving in Yexian, he would first reorganize it, and then transport the remaining scriptures back to Jinan. The Great Collection of Scriptures in Hainan Temple is the most complete copy in China. Now, unfortunately, it has been burned. Even if it is to keep the remnants, it has preservation value. It is said that the scriptures stored in Hainan Temple are a unique copy engraved in the Ming Dynasty, and the estimated value should be more than 500,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The Qingdao Municipal Government previously received an order from the Examination Yuan to hold qualification examinations to select true talent. The Qualification Examination Committee was immediately organized, and the Director of Education, Xu Chongqin, was appointed as the chairman to be responsible for all preparations.

<h3 id="e83">The Mutiny in Jiang County, Shanxi Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Feng's Army in Fenyang Prevents Jin Army from Taking Over</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The problem of military mutinies in Shanxi Province has not been completely resolved with Yang Xiaoou's troops in Changzhi. Now, Zhang Suiyin's troops stationed in Jiang County have also mutinied. The atmosphere in Fenyang has suddenly become tense in recent days, so optimism is premature. However, since Ding Mengling, the regimental commander of Yang's troops in Changzhi, led the rebel soldiers to flee to Lingchuan, Yang has dispatched troops to pursue and suppress them. It is reported that Ding has fled to Jincheng. The various counties in that area are close to the Henan border and are mostly mountainous, so thorough suppression is also difficult. The troops stationed in Jiang County are the Zhang Suiyin division of Zhang Zizhong's army. This division directly governs three regiments. Except for the first regiment, which is Zhang's direct lineage, the other two regiments are the old troops of Fan Zhongxiu, who were incorporated at the end of the Henan campaign last year. The actual number of people in each regiment is only equivalent to a battalion. The reasons for this mutiny are: first, internal</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>disharmony and deep resentment, and second, Zhang was very unhappy about being suddenly reduced from division commander to regimental commander. Before the downsizing, Zhang went to Yuncheng to ask Song Zheyuan for instructions. After returning, he felt that his personal position had been downgraded and that there was no prospect of military pay. Therefore, he started a mutiny, intending to flee to Henan and enjoy the life of a bandit. When Zhang was preparing for a full-scale mutiny, he made a flag, but the plan was leaked. The two battalion commanders of Fan's old troops, the second and third, detected it. The two battalion commanders immediately telegraphed Song Zheyuan to inform him. Song immediately replied by telegram, ordering them to take the initiative, surround and disarm them. After receiving the telegram, the two battalion commanders besieged the first battalion overnight, capturing all the soldiers and officers and tying up Zhang Suiyin. After the first battalion was almost resolved, the two battalions suddenly had bad intentions and staged a robbery, ravaging the city gates and nearby villages. Later, Song sent personnel to the county, and the two battalions pushed the responsibility for the robbery onto the first battalion and immediately shot Zhang Suiyin. All soldiers were disarmed and escorted to Quwo for reorganization. It is reported that the county's losses were at least 500,000 yuan. Representatives are currently being sent to the province to petition for consultation on the aftermath. As for Fenyang, it is guarded by Feng Yuxiang's troops. Yang Xiaoou's troops have recently completed their reorganization in Changzhi and have been ordered to station there. The vanguard troops have already arrived in Qixian. However, upon hearing the news, Feng suddenly gathered his troops in the city and asked Shang Zhen to stop Yang's troops from entering the area. It is rumored that Feng is currently still in Fenyang. How this matter will be resolved has attracted social attention. (April 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Jilin-Tongjiang Railway to Start Construction Next Month <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>More than 2,000 Li from Jilin to Tongjiang</p>
<p>The entire railway is divided into two sections to be completed within four years.</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The construction of the Jilin-Tongjiang Railway was proposed three years ago. It starts from Yongji County, the provincial capital of Jilin Province, and ends at Tongjiang County in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, with a length of 2,100 Chinese miles. It passes through eight counties, namely Shulan, Wuchang, Wuzhu, Yanshou, Fangzheng, Yilan, Huachuan, and Fujin. These eight counties are the richest agricultural and forestry areas in Jilin Province, and there are many areas with great potential for development. However, due to inconvenient transportation, except for the summer and autumn when boats can be taken on the Songhua River, land transportation is required in spring and winter. When it rains continuously and large clouds fly, the roads are often cut off, which is particularly inconvenient for military transport. Recently, the Jilin Provincial Government decided to set up a preparation office for the Jilin-Tongjiang Railway in the provincial capital to begin preparations. The surveying and engineering of the entire railway was completed by the Jilin-Hunchun Railway Surveying Team at the end of March. Construction is scheduled to begin in May of this year to fill the roadbed. The entire railway project is divided into two sections: the southern section from Jilin City through Shulan and Wuchang to Wuzhu, and the northern section from Wuzhu River through Yanshou, Fangzheng, Yilan, Fujin, Huachuan to Tongjiang. Because transportation in the northern section is more important than in the southern section, it was decided to start with the northern section first, with the intention of completing the earthwork project by the end of this year and laying sleepers and rails next year. The northern section is longer and must pass through several small mountains, making construction more difficult. Therefore, it is further divided into three sections: one section from Yanshou to Fangzheng, a second section from Fangzheng to Huachuan, and a third section from Huachuan to Tongjiang. It is estimated that the entire northern section will be open to traffic within three years. The southern section is easier to construct and will begin earthwork in 1934 and be completed in 1935. The entire line is scheduled to be open to traffic from Yongji to Tongjiang within five years. The cost of earthwork construction in the northern section will be allocated 5 million Harbin taels by the Jilin Yongheng Official Bank (equivalent to 4 million silver dollars). Thereafter, 5 million yuan will be raised annually within the province, with 25 million yuan as the total cost of the railway. Rails and vehicles will be purchased from the Beining Railway. The construction of this railway is entirely by the strength of Jilin Province. Zhang Zuoxiang once stated that he would not borrow foreign money or solicit foreign shares to maintain the spirit of a provincially owned railway. The personnel preparing for the Jilin-Tongjiang Railway are concurrently employed by the Jilin-Hunchun and Jilin-Dunhua railways without pay to save money.</p>

<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Liaoning Anti-Drug Joint Association previously held a conference to oppose the opium public sale, issued a declaration, telegraphed the whole country, and made greater efforts for anti-drug work in the province to thoroughly eradicate the scourge of drugs. In order to expand publicity, it was specifically decided to convene the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Provincial Legal Groups on the 23rd and 24th of this month to hold the Northeast Anti-Drug Joint Conference. Its official letter was issued on the 4th, and the original text is recorded below: "It has been found that the opium scourge has been in China for more than a hundred years, humiliating the country and endangering the race, which is heartbreaking. Unexpectedly, Dr. Wu Liande proposed adopting the opium public sale system, which caused great surprise upon hearing it. In view of this, our association plans to hold the Northeast Anti-Drug Joint Conference on the 23rd and 24th of this month. We have long admired your association's enthusiasm for anti-drug efforts and concern for the country. We hereby send this letter to invite you to send personnel to attend the conference to jointly plan anti-drug work so that drugs can be eradicated as soon as possible." It is heard that the venue for the joint anti-drug conference of the three provinces has been selected as the YMCA. With the united efforts of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, anti-drug work will surely achieve good results in the future. (April 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Reasons for Peng Guanghan's Arrest <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Impersonating the Chief of Works of the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>A Shandong man named Peng Guanghan came to Beijing last month and resided in Room 8 of the Dadong Hotel in Xiaguan, accompanied by a servant named Li Zhigang. According to Peng Guanghan, he is a Doctor of Law, a current advisor to both the Military and Civilian Affairs Office of Jiangsu Province, and the Chief of Works of the Jinpu Railway. He was exceptionally extravagant. The hotel's guest registration book also stated that he worked for the Jinpu Railway. Therefore, everyone from the hotel manager down knew that Peng was the Chief of Works of the Jinpu Railway. Later, the police section of the Jinpu Railway learned of the above situation and sent personnel to investigate and verify that it was true. They immediately went to investigate and arrest him in conjunction with the Xiaguan Police Station and found dozens of business cards (with the words "Doctor of Law, Advisor to the Military and Civilian Affairs Office of Jiangsu Province, Chief of Works of the Jinpu Railway") and a handwritten draft letter (roughly saying, "After this visit to the department, I will be sent to the Northeast to recover vehicles, and there is hope of becoming the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Office. Now there is no certainty, so I dare not go yet. Therefore, Chairman Chen is going to the Northeast. After Chen returns to Beijing, everything can be resolved,"). Believing that the evidence of impersonation was conclusive, Peng and his servant were escorted to the Xiaguan Police Station. They were then greeted and taken to Pu by the police section of the railway. Peng confessed to impersonating without denial. As for the reason for the impersonation, he said that a friend named Wu in the Shanghai Purchasing Materials Committee of the Ministry of Railways could introduce him to purchasing materials to defraud merchants of money. The railway believes that Peng dared to swagger arbitrarily in the capital, not only damaging the reputation of the railway but also defrauding merchants of money. Yesterday, the police had escorted Peng to the Jiangning District Court for punishment.</p>

Villagers in the Sixth District Destroyed the District Office: The Changtai section of the Zhenhu Road, which is being built by conscripted labor in this county, began construction on the 6th of this month. Various works are being planned and carried out. The construction of this section of the road passes through six districts, occupying a lot of land. The road construction office has also sent personnel to the countryside to entrust the district offices to follow the methods of buying land and give out compensation funds. On the afternoon of the 8th, villagers in the sixth district believed that the compensation funds given by the district office were uneven and were dissatisfied. They gathered dozens of people and went to the district office and demolished the office. The fifth branch of the Public Security Bureau of the district was notified and sent police to suppress the villagers and disperse them, preventing a major disaster. Later, the district chief, Gu Ren, personally came to the city to report to the county government and the Construction Bureau. The director of the Construction Bureau, Chen Qiwei, personally went to the countryside to investigate on a gasoline boat and planned to find a way to mediate.</p>

<p>Nine Counties Extend Long-Distance Telephone Service: The long-distance telephone service in nine counties in Jiangsu Province was originally only available to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Piaoshui, Jurong, Danyang, Liyang, Jinshan, Yixing, and Wujiang. Later, Bu Zaichen, the director of the Telecommunications Administration Office, presented to the Construction Department for approval to extend the Suchang line for the sake of communication. Exchange stations were added in Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, and telephone service began on January 1 of this year. However, due to transmission difficulties, business was slow. Director Deng also negotiated with the Wuxi Telephone Company to connect urban and rural telephone lines. Telephone service can be provided at any time to avoid the trouble of repeated calls and inquiries. Moreover, considering the current situation, it is necessary to add exchange stations in Jiangyin and Changshu. It has been decided to expand the Cheng-Yu line from the Wuxi exchange. The Construction Department has approved the dispatch of personnel to Shanghai to order a large number of electrical materials, and an engineering team will be dispatched in the next few days to depart from Wuxi and install the equipment along the way. The telephone service is scheduled to be completed during the silkworm cocoon season. The route will pass through Xiqiao and the Changshu line will be installed along the Xichang Road.</p>

<p>Using the Name of Silk Factories to Defraud Cocoon Funds: Li Ruji, a shareholder of the Li Fang Cocoon Firm in Yuqi Town, Qingcheng City, this county, entrusted Yin Jintai, Chen Quanlin, etc., to go to Xiagang, Jiangyin County, to buy dry cocoons from retail households at the Xinlun Cocoon Firm in the county in June of last year. According to Yin, they claimed to Zhu Shifu, the manager of the firm, that the dry cocoons were being purchased on behalf of the De Da Yu Silk Factory in this county, stating that after the dry cocoons arrived in Xiyi, the cocoon funds would be remitted by the Ruichangrun Money House. Zhu believed this to be true and immediately sold them 30 dan of dry cocoons, with a cocoon fund of more than 7,000 yuan. At that time, more than 4,000 yuan was paid in advance, and more than 2,044 yuan was still owed, with an agreed date to pay the balance. Unexpectedly, Li did not fulfill the agreement, and Li and others avoided meeting Zhu when he urged them to pay. Zhu believed that Li and others had been repeatedly evasive and could no longer tolerate it. Moreover, after investigating the situation, it was clear that Li and others had intentionally colluded to defraud. Therefore, Zhu recently came to Xiyi from Cheng and hired a lawyer, Tang Ying, to pursue them severely in accordance with the law in the County Court.</p>

<p>Cheng Shifu Killed by Police for Harboring Bandits: Cheng Shifu, aged 50, from Renjia Bridge, Shuangpai, East Outer, had a female consort who knew bandits and harbored them in his home. The other day, Ma Huaizhong, the leader of the guerrilla team, led a team to the area. Cheng Shifu escaped from the back door and was shot and killed by a guard. The incident was immediately reported to County Magistrate Zhu, who dispatched an official to inspect the body.</p>
<p>Measures for Land Registration and Exchange of Certificates: Shen Lunxu, the director of the Finance Bureau, believed that the local finances were extremely difficult. After inspecting the land certificates of the Jiangyin Cao Sand Fields, he found that the certificates had been exchanged during the Tongzhi period after the Taiping Rebellion, which was already 60 to 70 years ago. Many of the names of the original land owners were still listed, even though the land had been transferred through sales or inheritance. This caused obstacles to the collection of busy Cao. It is now planned to imitate the measures of Jingjiang County for land registration and exchange of certificates and to increase the Ke and other matters. The measures have been drafted and will be submitted to the Finance Department for review and approval in the near future.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Follows Orders to Hand Over Charitable Funds: The first district office repeatedly sent letters to the Relief Institute for the transfer of charitable funds such as the Public Benevolence Hall, insisting on forming another management committee before handing over the funds. The Relief Institute rejected the request. District Chief Zhu then sent a report to the county, stating that they were not keeping their promise, and asked the county to forward the report for correction. The county government believed that the various points reported by District Chief Zhu were contradictory and that the pointless dispute was inappropriate. As for the formation of another management committee, the government believed that there was no such provision in the law and it was not appropriate to approve it. The district chief was ordered to transfer the funds in accordance with the order and was not allowed to delay by pretext. He was rebuked with words such as "If there are any mistakes, he will be held accountable."</p>

<p>The Ma Ling Kidnapping Case Solved: The son of Xia Yingfu from Ma Ling, West Township, was kidnapped by bandits, who demanded a ransom of 3,000 yuan. Later, the Xia family sent people to negotiate with the bandits repeatedly, reducing the ransom to half. They agreed to meet ten li away from Xinfeng. Recently, the Xia family received another letter from the bandits, which contained many threats, so they sent the original letter to the Public Security Bureau. Township Director Hong Shun and others disguised themselves and went to the area. They arrested a bandit eight or nine li away from Xinfeng and found a pistol on his body. They immediately took him to the County Bureau for questioning. He confessed that his name was Xu Fenglin, that the pistol was not his, and that the leader was now living in Wangjia Alley in the city, named Wang Haixuan. After receiving the confession, Bureau Chief Zou immediately sent detectives to arrest him at the address and arrested the bandit Wang and also arrested Jia Debiao and Jiang Changfu. They found the location where the kidnapped person was hidden in Jiashan in the North Township and found a box gun. They also arrested Wang Haibao and others on the spot, who were said to be related to a robbery case in the city. They have now been escorted to the county government for questioning.</p>

<p>Regulations Set Completion Dates for Local County "Purification" Campaigns: The Jiangsu Province's county "Purification" Bureaus were previously ordered to be established and have been successively set up. However, since their establishment occurred at different times, the specified completion dates also vary. The General Bureau's designated completion dates are listed below: Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Jurong, Danyang, Jintan, Yixing, Rugao, Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiangdu, Taixian, Wuxian, Changshu are all limited to completion by the end of March. However, Songjiang and three other counties have requested an extension to the end of April. Although the remaining counties are not expected to exceed the deadline, apart from Wujiang, which has reported completion, most others have not yet submitted reports. As for Shenshui, Gao , Liuhe, Wujin, Jingjiang, Nantong, Taixing, Jinshan, Yancheng, and Haimen, these ten counties can all complete the process by the end of April. The remaining twenty-eight counties, such as Wuxi, Jiangyin, Huaiyin, Huaian, Guanyun, Ganyu, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Taicang, Siyang, Lianshui, Funing, Yizheng, Dongtai, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Baoying, Donghai, Tongshan, Feng, Pei, Xiao, Dang, Pi, Su, Sui, and Mu, will complete the process by early May or the end of May. The latest completion date for Muyang should be June 4th. However, regardless of the situation, the completion should not exceed the end of June. It remains to be seen whether the various counties can complete the "Purification" work as scheduled.</p>
<p>Request to Shorten Mortgage Redemption Period Denied: Yesterday, the Jiangsu Province Mortgage Industry Association submitted a request to the Finance Department regarding the precarious situation of the mortgage industry, seeking to shorten the redemption period to provide relief. The request stated that both the establishment of Farmers' Banks and the pawnshop business were intended to provide assistance to the poor. However, a comparison revealed a disparity. Banks could recover loans within a specified timeframe, while pawnshops' redemption was at the discretion of the mortgagor. Goods were subject to appreciation and depreciation. Appreciated goods were redeemed, while depreciated goods led to expiration and difficult-to-recover losses during sales. Therefore, it was proposed to appropriately shorten the eighteen-month redemption period to twelve months to facilitate turnover. Furthermore, regarding the monthly interest collection, while strong persuasion had led to compliance, some businesses still struggled to maintain operations. The Finance Department was requested to relax its supervision and provide pawnshops with a lifeline. After receiving the request, the Finance Department responded that the provincial pawnshop business regulations had already been revised and promulgated by the provincial government, making it difficult to amend them. The request to shorten the redemption period was denied. Regarding the monthly interest collection, it should be handled in accordance with Article 16 of the revised business regulations.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce and Shipping Guild Elect People's Assembly Representatives: Yesterday (the 8th) was the date for the Chamber of Commerce and Shipping Guild to elect representatives.

Since there were only slightly over ninety members, their voting finished earlier, even though it started later. Therefore, the Shipping Guild votes were counted first. The Chamber of Commerce votes were counted starting around 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The results are recorded below. A total of 405 members voted in the Chamber of Commerce election.

<p>Eighth and Tenth Autonomous Districts Compete for Jurisdiction Over Luzhuang: The eighth and tenth autonomous districts are vying for jurisdiction over the location of Luzhuang. The village has already been assigned to the tenth district. Currently, the villagers of the village do not wish to be included in the tenth district and have submitted a petition through the relevant Yanhe township head, Lu Heling, stating that Luzhuang belongs to the eastern bank of Shaobo Zhaoguan Dam and has been for a hundred years, making it inappropriate to change its jurisdiction. The petition has been forwarded to the eighth district office for submission to the county government for resolution. However, it is reported that the tenth district head, Zhang Bao, has already led the Huo Hao township head, Guo Xingbo, in erecting boundary markers in Luzhuang.</p>

<p>This Month's 12th Day</p>
<p>In the 13th year of the Republic of China, when the Chinese Nationalist Party held its first national congress, the Chinese Communist Party sent representatives to contact Sun Yat-sen, the General Manager of the Nationalist Party, stating that the Communist Party's past political beliefs were completely wrong and that the Chinese revolution could only succeed by adhering to the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution and striving diligently. Therefore, all members of the Communist Party would withdraw from the Communist Party and would join the Nationalist Party as individuals. Sun Yat-sen, the General Manager of the Nationalist Party, believed that the members of the Communist Party were mostly young and that their temporary mistakes were forgivable, so he allowed them to join in their individual capacity. However, the cunning and treacherous Communists, after joining the Nationalist Party, saw that General Manager Sun was alive and did not dare to engage in rampant usurpation. After the General Manager went north and passed away, they engaged in discord and alienated the loyal comrades of the Nationalist Party. They then usurped the cadres and seized key positions. All comrades who were loyal to the Three Principles of the People were either forced into exile or destroyed on some pretext. When the Nationalist Party swore to launch the Northern Expedition, the Communists initially engaged in open slander and opposition. Later, they secretly sent confidants to infiltrate the military, hoping to subvert the Nationalist Party and destroy the National Revolution. After the Northern Expeditionary Army recovered Jiangsu and Zhejiang, their intentions became clearer and their plans became more urgent. The members of the Central Committee, Chiang Kai-shek, Wu Zhihui, and Li Shizeng, realized that a crisis was lurking and was imminent, so they decisively took extraordinary measures to carry out the Purification in the 16th year of the Republic of China, which stabilized the foundation of the Party and the nation. Now, the Communist elements within the Nationalist Party have been purged, but the remaining Red Bandits are still harassing the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. After pacifying the Yan Feng warlords, the Central Government sent a large army to encircle and suppress the bandits and appointed Comrade He Yingqin to act as the Commander-in-Chief to be responsible for the suppression. The large army is gathering, and the people are cheering. It is certain that they will be able to return victoriously before the National Congress on May 5th. However, recalling the suffering of the people under the Red Bandits and the danger of the Communist Party's attempt to usurp the Party and the nation, we cannot help but feel deeply saddened. On the fourth anniversary of the Purification, we feel even more deeply the greatness and importance of the Purification. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has drafted commemorative measures and submitted them to the Municipal Executive Committee for deliberation. The Municipal Executive Committee has now passed the measures. It is reported that a commemorative meeting will be held at 8:00 AM on April 12th in the grand auditorium on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. At that time, all agencies, organizations, and schools in the city should send four representatives to participate. Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, Meilong, Zhenru, and other places that are farther away from the city may convene nearby people separately to hold commemorative ceremonies. On that day, all levels of Party headquarters and permanent propaganda teams will also be dispatched to conduct propaganda.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Two Bureaus Proclaim Prohibition of Unauthorized Strikes <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a proclamation yesterday prohibiting unauthorized strikes. The proclamation stated: "Regarding the matter of a joint proclamation, it has been found that female workers at the Fuchangtai Silk Factory in Zhabei and other silk factories suddenly went on strike without authorization starting on April 1st. This bureau and others have already strictly prohibited this and have issued a proclamation on file. The female workers must know that working in a factory is not only for personal livelihood but also bears the responsibility for national production. They should be diligent and disciplined. Moreover, the silk industry is a business that faces international competition. Cooperation between labor and management is even more important. How can they belittle themselves, be easily incited, damage their vitality, and violate the law? If there are matters that must be discussed with the factory, they should have valid reasons and follow legal procedures. This is the right way. If they strike again without authorization, attempting to disrupt public order, the Public Security Bureau, as its duty requires, will thoroughly investigate the principal and accomplices and severely punish them according to the law. The female workers are urged not to do it again to avoid blame. This proclamation is issued in earnest."</p>

<p>Already Told Party Leaders Not to Elect Him</p>
<p>Has Opinions to Express on the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>The election of National Congress representatives has attracted social attention. It is reported that the Central Government has designated two members, Pan Gongzhan and Wu Kaixian, as candidates for one of the Shanghai City Party Headquarters' representatives. The party members of each district sub-branch will hold direct votes starting from the 15th on a scheduled basis. A reporter from Xin Sheng She specifically visited Pan yesterday to inquire about his views on the People's Congress. According to Pan, the list of legal organizations representing agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles in the city has already been reviewed by the election office and will likely be announced within days. It is firmly believed that healthy representatives will be produced in the future to meet the expectations of the citizens. As for the party representatives, it is his personal opinion that Comrade Wu Kaixian is more suitable. Because he himself currently holds a position in the municipal government as a civil servant, if he is elected, he would have to go through procedures such as suspension. Also, the opening of the People's Congress is in May, which is often eventful. Shanghai is a center of industry and commerce, and labor-management disputes are likely to arise. It is better not to leave his current position. Therefore, he has expressed to the comrades of the City Party Headquarters that they should not elect him. He firmly believes that Comrade Kaixian has been handling party affairs in the city for many years and will be able to adopt as much as possible the reasonable opinions of the city's comrades and make proposals to the People's Congress on their behalf. When asked about his opinions on the draft constitution to be discussed by the People's Congress, Pan showed the reporter a letter he had sent to the members of the draft constitution committee in March. The letter was lengthy and is omitted.</p>

<p>Luo Panhui Promoted to Director of Two Railway Bureaus</p>
<p>After Liu Weichi, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, was appointed to manage the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, he was able to actively improve railway administration and spare no effort, despite the impact of military affairs in the past year. Among them, the improvement of train operation, the improvement of hygiene, the addition of locomotives and vehicles, the expansion of platforms, the reconstruction of stations, the construction of turnouts, the replacement of sleepers, and the removal of malpractices were all well-received by travelers. There is hope for a national model railway. However, the Ministry of Railways believes that the Pinghan Railway is of great importance to military and economic affairs. In recent years, it has been severely affected by the situation and has been in disrepair. It has long been determined to reorganize it. Recently, funds have been raised and work will begin immediately. Liu is talented in construction, sincere in his work, and has a deep relationship with the Party. He once managed the Pinghan Railway and had a reorganization plan. Due to his support for the Central Government, the railway was looted by the rebel army. Now, the Ministry of Railways has changed the railway to a reorganization committee, and Liu has been transferred to the chairman of the committee. Several other expert committee members have been selected to reorganize the railway openly. As for the directors of the two railway bureaus, it is reported that Luo Panhui, the director of the General Affairs Department of the bureau, will be promoted.</p>

"To: The writer hereby informs you that the bureau had previously scheduled a meeting on the 12th of this month to discuss the promotion of the new system of weights and measures and has already sent a letter to you for your information.

The City Chamber of Commerce had previously convened a meeting of representatives from various industries to discuss the implementation of the new system of weights and measures and resolved six measures. Yesterday, it submitted two supplementary measures to the Social Affairs Bureau for consideration. The measures are recorded below: "(1) In addition to being stamped by the Inspection Office, each new instrument should also be stamped by the respective industry association to facilitate identification. The respective industry associations are responsible for forwarding the instruments to all stores, whether they are members of the association or not, to facilitate statistics. (2) The practice of stores directly submitting new instruments to the Inspection Office for inspection should be prohibited. Instead, the instruments should be collected by the respective industry associations and submitted in batches for inspection to save trouble and avoid variations in style."</p>

<h3 id="e115">United States Increases Import Tax Rate on Egg Products <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Strive</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, This month, we received a letter from the Egg Factory Association stating that, according to a report in the Zi Lin Daily, and also a cable from a fellow provincial in the United States, the United States Department of Agriculture has a proposal to increase the import tax rate on Chinese egg yolk and egg white, from 18 cents per pound to 27 cents. Chinese egg yolk and egg white have been sold to the United States for decades. The price per pound is only slightly more than 20 cents. These goods are not luxury items. The original tax rate, which is close to 100% of the value, is already excessive. The new rate, which is nearly 150% of the value, is even more outrageous. The intention is nothing more than to limit the import of foreign goods in order to develop domestic agricultural products. Because of the commercial treaty, they cannot openly advocate for boycotts, so they set this strange and harsh tax rate to make Chinese businessmen retreat. In this way, they can avoid the bad name of boycotts and achieve the practical effect of boycotts. The design is skillful and the means are ruthless. The various products of China's egg factory industry have always relied on foreign countries as the only sales channel. Once they are hit by this, the sales channel will be blocked and there will be no other options besides closing down. Not only will the decades of hard work of the industry be completely destroyed, but also hundreds of thousands of workers who rely on it for food and clothing will lose their jobs. Therefore, we urge your office to immediately cable the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ask the Minister to the United States to directly lodge a strong protest with the President of the United States, urging them to cancel the proposal and reduce the original tax rate to comply with the principle of equality and reciprocity. We are anxiously waiting for your orders." The City Chamber of Commerce stated that the new revised customs import tax rate in China this year, according to American newspapers, is said to have increased but not significantly and does not hinder the flow of American goods, which is comforting. Trade between the two countries must practice the principle of equality and reciprocity in order to increase mutual benefits. The current global market is sluggish, partly due to the strict tariff barriers. The United States' prior efforts to help its many workers are no longer sufficient for politicians. The Far East market serves as a tailpipe for adjustment. If Chinese goods are excluded and taxes are repeatedly increased, it will not be beneficial to US-China trade. Please cable Minister Wu this intention and ask him to present it to the US government earnestly so that they can cancel the tax increase in order to maintain their commercial interests in China, which is in the public interest for manufacturers. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this request.</p>

<p>Notice from the County Finance Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday, which read: "Regarding the matter of notice, according to the instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, concerning the provincial brokerage tax, which is dedicated to education funds, it has been approved to continue to be handled as before. However, upon investigation of the regulations for brokerage houses, the scope is limited to buying and selling on behalf of customers. If, in addition to buying and selling on behalf of customers, there is concurrent self-operated commerce directly selling goods, the concurrent sales portion should still follow the business tax regulations, apply for a business license, and pay business tax, in order to prevent taking advantage and covering up. In addition to separate instructions, it is hereby ordered that the director of the bureau comply with and handle accordingly. Therefore, this notice is issued to all brokerage houses in the county. If the businesses, in addition to buying and selling on behalf of customers, have concurrent self-operated commerce directly selling goods, the concurrent sales portion should still follow the business tax regulations, apply for a business license, and pay business tax, and must not take advantage or cover up, lest they be penalized.

<h3 id="e117">Various Industries Request Correction of Business Tax Rates <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>New Pharmaceutical Industry: The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the issue of business tax rates, stating that the association had previously requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Tax Rules Research Committee of various trade associations to telegraph the government to request correction of the tax rate stipulated for the new pharmaceutical industry in the business tax regulations formulated by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which exceeded the general principles promulgated by the Ministry. Subsequently, they received a reply stating, "The business tax rate should not exceed two per thousand, unless the government has other regulations stipulating less than two per thousand." The Ministry of Finance has been directly telegraphed, requesting correction during the amendment of the business tax regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and successive instructions have been received, all stating that efforts should be made to ensure that the tax system benefits both commerce and the government. The intentions are greatly appreciated. However, upon recently seeing reports that the Ministry of Finance (your ministry) amended the business tax regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, stipulating two per thousand for traditional Chinese medicine and five per thousand for new medicine, we are greatly alarmed. We believe that medicine is for treating diseases and is greatly related to the lives of the people. It is neither a luxury item nor subject to prohibition. If five per thousand is levied, it not only violates Article 4 of the general principles promulgated by the Ministry but also hinders the improvement of northern-made medicine, which contradicts the Ministry's orders. The Ministry of Health, in view of the rapid development of science, is concerned that old medicines will no longer be improved and wants to eliminate them with the trend of the world. Therefore, there has been a clear order to improve old medicines. New pharmaceutical industries in various places are setting up pharmaceutical factories, adopting traditional Chinese medicine science, and chemically manufacturing new medicines to resist imported goods. If the tax rates levied on traditional Chinese medicine and new medicine are different, it is tantamount to deliberate discrimination. To take a step back, if it is thought that new medicines contain foreign-made medicines, then traditional Chinese medicines also contain imported raw materials. Medicine is mainly for saving people and is more important than food. Even if there are imported goods, it is because there are no such products in the country, and it is unavoidable for the sake of the people's lives. Its tax rate should not be increased. Article 7 of the supplementary measures to the general principles of business tax clearly stipulates that all kinds of business taxes, regardless of whether they operate in domestic or foreign goods, should be taxed at the same tax rate. Therefore, in terms of both reason and law, new medicines and traditional Chinese medicines should be taxed at the same rate. It is reasonable to telegraph your government to instruct (your office to consult) the Ministry of Finance, to take into account the prestige of the government, to consider the pain of pharmaceutical merchants, to correct the business tax rate of new medicines, and not to exceed two per thousand. This would be a great virtue. Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Eyeglasses Industry: The Shanghai Eyeglasses Industry Association was originally organized in the 18th year of the Republic of China as the "Chinese Eyeglasses Association". Now, because it is inconsistent with the laws of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association, it was initiated by companies such as Daming, Sino-American, Oriental, Jingyi, Jinghua, Xinghua, Central, Dahua, Yaoxiangren, and other companies to reorganize and rename it the Shanghai Eyeglasses Industry Association, in order to comply with laws and regulations and to emphasize public affairs. It is reported that the association has been very perfect since its reorganization. Yesterday, due to the excessive business tax rate, it specifically sent a letter to the Shanghai Tax Rules Research Association of various industries, requesting it to forward the correction, in order to reduce the burden. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respected Sirs, since the government established business tax to remedy the loss of tariff cuts, the formulation of tax rates in Jiangsu Province, although there is a distinction between the two amounts of business capital, the meaning of the text from one to twelve to twenty has room for activity. The intention is nothing more than to reduce taxes on practical products and increase taxes on luxury goods. The scope of increasing taxes includes the nature of prohibition, and the types of reducing taxes contain the enthusiasm of promotion. The law is perfect. However, for material categories, it is appropriate</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>To strictly distinguish them, so as not to mix luxury and practical use, and to prevent the inappropriateness of increasing and decreasing taxes. This is the reason why your association was organized and established. Because the world has always lacked considerable research on our industry, there are many people who regard it as a luxury item, and there are also many who regard it as a practical item, which makes the government's current regulations on the business tax rate of the eyeglasses industry unable to balance with the lumber tax rate (the Ministry of Finance amended the business tax regulations of Jiangsu Province, stipulating two per thousand for lumber and ten per thousand for eyeglasses). We dare to briefly state our humble opinion for your association's adoption. Although there are only three types of eyeglasses: nearsighted, farsighted, and plano, each has a special function. For example, people with nearsightedness mostly cannot see far away. Once they wear nearsighted glasses, everything that is far away is immediately presented in front of them. Elderly people with depleted essence and blood and lack of vision often find it difficult to read newspapers and write. Once they wear farsighted glasses, the subtle details are immediately distinguishable, and they can read and write freely. All young people who are eager to study should know that prolonged vision can most easily injure the blood. Wearing plano glasses often not only has hygienic benefits but also contains the function of protection. As for colored glasses, they can block sunlight and lamplight, and are most suitable for sick eyes, with the function of treatment. From this point of view, it can be seen that eyeglasses are to the eyes as medicine is to disease. Therefore, many European and American countries list eyeglasses as medicinal items, which can be said to be very appropriate. Before the business tax rate of Shanghai City has been approved by the Ministry, please ask your association to forward the correction of the business tax rate of our industry. Our industry is very fortunate."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Paint Industry Association believes that the business tax rate exceeds the original fixed amount and is too high, making it impossible to bear. Recently, it was reported that the business tax of Jiangsu Province is stipulated to be two per thousand for oils and paints, while the Western-style furniture industry such as rosewood and mahogany is still set at ten per thousand.

<h3 id="e120">City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Ministry of Finance to Request Correction of Foil Industry Special Tax <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday to request correction of the special business tax for the foil industry. The original text reads: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 9th of this month, we received a letter from the Foil Industry Association stating that on the 4th, we received a letter from your association stating that we received an electrical message from the Ministry of Finance stating that according to the reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, the special business tax for the foil industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is levied according to the original special tax plan, and the tax revenue is used to fund Zhejiang's administrative expenses, and a portion is allocated to prepare for the livelihood of foil workers, and the remaining amount is allocated to the central government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, totaling more than 500,000 yuan per year, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government is consulted that the sale of Zhejiang foil in Jiangsu Province will no longer be subject to other taxes, so as to avoid double burden, in order to comply with the original intention of the order of the Academy to handle the case. The recording of the electrical message has been delivered, and we hope to check it. Upon investigation, the special business tax for foil in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been allocated to the central education fund under the original plan, with 300,000 yuan per year for Jiangsu and 270,000 yuan for Jiangsu. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is consulted that the sale of Zhejiang foil in Jiangsu will no longer be subject to other taxes. Why does the Shanghai Customs always refuse to report on the new tax bills issued by Zhejiang Province? Since the beginning of this year, when Zhejiang foil is shipped from Ningbo to Shanghai, or from Shanghai to various counties in northern Jiangsu, when passing through the customs, the new tax bills are generally invalid. Unless taxes are paid again, they will not be released. This is inconsistent with the original plan, and we earnestly request the Ministry of Finance to correct it. Second, during the former special tax era, after one tax was paid, it could pass through the whole country, and the checkpoints were inspected and released without any difficulty. Now, the original plan submitted by Zhejiang Province to the Ministry specifies that the sales area is limited to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the scope is too narrow, which hinders sales. We have already felt the pain of not being able to circulate. Unexpectedly, in fact, even within the two provinces, it cannot pass without hindrance, and customs duties must be paid again, which directly troubles the business of foil merchants and indirectly hinders the livelihood of foil workers. This is inconsistent with the original plan, and we earnestly request the Ministry of Finance to correct it. In summary, the foil merchants feel very painful. Recently, we read in the newspaper that the National Government is planning to levy a special tax or registration tax on tin foil. If it is as reported, it will inevitably be taxed repeatedly. The foil merchants are weak and cannot bear the heavy burden. Our association is extremely panicked. For this reason, we urgently present this letter, and we respectfully request your association to appreciate our sincerity and provide assistance, and allow us to telegraph the Ministry of Finance, to consider the difficulties of merchants, and not to increase the burden of foil merchants, implement a one-item-one-tax system, and allow it to pass through the whole country. And we request the customs in various places to exempt the Zhejiang foil from customs duties according to the old case, and still verify and release it with the new tax bill, in order to maintain the livelihood of the foil industry. Upon investigation, when the foil industry was handling the special tax, it was only worth 12.5 per hundred. This time, it was changed to a special business tax, and it is reported that it is worth 5 per thousand. Although the original text of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance stated that it was still taxed according to the old rate, in fact, it has exceeded it. Moreover, after the special tax was collected in full in the past, it was able to pass through the whole country, but this time it is limited to the scope of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and it is also said that no other taxes will be levied separately, and the Shanghai Customs always refuses to verify and release the new tax bills issued by Zhejiang Province, and it will not be released unless another tax is paid. All these are inconsistent with the original plan. Such repeated taxation will inevitably erode the lifeline of the foil industry. It is reasonable to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to review and approve it, and to correct it one by one according to the original plan, in order to maintain the livelihood of the industry. In addition, the special business tax paid by the industry, the tax rate is the same as the tax rate of the special consumption tax and the business tax, and the tax revenue is divided between the central government and the local government. Then, no matter what new tax is to be implemented in the future, the industry should be excluded, in order to comply with the general practice of one item one tax. Please also give a clear instruction to avoid the industry's suspicion. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Continues to Submit Application for License <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sauce, Wine, Tobacco, and Salt Joint Industry Association, after the members requested the open application for a license, received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, and yesterday submitted a letter to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau, Director Guan Wenyun, stating that the letter was submitted for the approval of the Ministry, requesting your office to be sympathetic and approve it, to relieve the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants and to fulfill the expectations of the public. Our association has previously requested the members of the two industries to apply for a license tax openly, and submitted the suffering situation to the Ministry of Finance for verification, and sent representatives to Beijing to petition your office. On the 2nd of this month, we received the Ministry of Finance's printed letter No. 12306, stating that the letter has been received, and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau has been ordered to verify and handle it. Our association is deeply grateful for the approval and is deeply impressed by the Ministry of Finance and your office's understanding of the commercial situation and preferential treatment. It is true that the tobacco and alcohol license tax is properly applied by the two industry associations, and the contractor system, which is purely for profit, is a policy that harms merchants. Now, we continue to present the details, investigating the tobacco and alcohol merchants who set up shops for business, and there are no regulations for spending when obtaining a license according to regulations, and the second district tobacco and alcohol license tax office, as a fixed example, charges an additional 1.2 yuan, under the name of application registration fee. For example, the Baoshan branch charges an additional 1.2 yuan for the numbers of the two industries, which is one of the harsh taxes that harms merchants. Furthermore, if the tax is overdue, the provincial regulations stipulate the level, and the office arbitrarily increases it month by month, adding one in the first month, two in the next month, and three in the last month, which is the second harsh tax that harms merchants. All previous tax offices have posted announcements in advance before the collection of each quarter, so that the public knows, and the address is added to the photo, so that merchants can go to the office to pay taxes within the time limit, so as to avoid the pain of additional penalties. In recent years, the tax office has not announced the collection, and the address is not marked, so that merchants cannot find it, and cannot pay within the time limit, which is the third harsh tax that harms merchants. In addition, there are collection personnel who arbitrarily solicit, and there are many malpractices, and small shops are most affected, and there is no recourse. Therefore, when the contracting period is approaching, the merchants of the two industries have requested our association to petition for open application and relieve the pain. The representatives have been convened for many meetings, and they have all paid the tobacco and alcohol license tax by the two industries to avoid the control of outsiders, and decided to submit a petition to pay the Jiangsu second district, the tobacco and alcohol license tax of the entire district, according to the tax amount of the 19th year, and the representatives have personally presented the various sections, and the monarch has adopted them, and the gratitude is indescribable. In view of the Ministry's instructions, it is reasonable to submit a letter for the sequel, and request your office to be considerate of the difficulties of the merchants, and quickly approve it, in order to comply with public opinion, and be grateful for the opportunity to wait. Sincerely presented to Director Guan of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau.</p>

<p>Summoning Both Parties for Questioning Today</p>
<p>The customs clearance workers in this city went on strike on the 6th because the Cotton Cloth Industry Association cancelled the cotton cloth freight and inspection fees, and the transportation of cotton cloth and yarn was completely stopped, affecting the shipping and causing panic among the customers. Yesterday, five workers of the inspection team were arrested. The authorities decided to summon them for questioning today in order to mediate. The details of the various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Workers Arrested: The day and night shift inspection team organized by the Customs Clearance Industry Union, as usual, went out to inspect yesterday. The night shift fifth team members Wang Ahe, Cheng Pinshun, and others, at about 6 pm, discovered that Xiexiang Public Firm was smuggling fifteen packages of sixteen Tianguan cotton yarn at the Taikoo Wharf, and immediately detained them. The two sides clashed. The matter was known to the French Patrol Room, and the patrol was dispatched to detain the goods along with the five inspectors and the smugglers at the Sixteen Shop Patrol Room. The union, upon hearing the news, immediately asked lawyer Fan Gang to negotiate, and at the same time sent someone to Xiexiang Public Firm for serious negotiations.</p>
<p>Authority Mediation: The City Social Bureau, because of the strike of customs clearance workers, the suspension of cotton yarn and cloth transportation, has a significant impact on social security and the business community. In order to quickly resolve the situation, in addition to sending someone to investigate the truth, it also designated a commissioner to summon both the Customs Clearance Industry Union and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association to the bureau at 2 pm today to listen to the questioning, in order to mediate and avoid the expansion of the labor movement.</p>
<p>Yarn Industry Panic: The Cotton Yarn Industry Market, for the cotton yarn suspension problem, yesterday sent a letter to the Customs Clearance Industry Union, stating that it was responding to your letter, I have learned, and I have also received a letter from my colleagues, deeply saddened by the strike of your union's staff. This matter is related to the Cotton Cloth Industry's proposal to cancel the car force. It is completely unrelated to my colleagues in the textile industry. The suspension of the loading and transportation of yarn and cloth will inevitably affect my colleagues in the textile industry. Moreover, the registration of old goods ends on April 15th. If it expires, a unified tax will be added. If there are disputes and losses between my colleagues and the customers in the future, your union will not be able to avoid the blame. Not only that, but the price of cotton yarn fluctuates from time to time. If the date is extended, more disputes will inevitably arise. If the customers are eager to load and transport, and entrust the foreign company to handle it, your industry will also feel disadvantaged. Therefore, I specifically inform you that the cotton yarn item should be restored to the loading and transportation work first. Not only will my colleagues avoid accidental losses, but your industry will also have a deep concern.</p>
<p>Union General Meeting: The Customs Clearance Industry Union held a joint emergency board meeting at 2 pm yesterday. Fourteen directors and supervisors, including Sun Dongsheng, attended. He Yumin presided over the meeting. It was resolved that (1) Su Houren, Xin Xiang, Li Houfu, He Yumin, He Yuqin, Liang Jikang, Zhou Juxing, Sun Dongsheng, and other eight people should attend the City Social Bureau mediation meeting as representatives. (2) Liang Jikang, the director of the investigation department, when attending the mediation meeting, his duties will be represented by Xu Rongsheng. (3) If members of the foreign goods department request to join the strike assistance case, if the Cotton Cloth Industry has no sincerity in accepting mediation, they will be allowed to join on the 13th. Also, regarding the economic issues during the union strike period, the members are very enthusiastic. Each person helps 5 yuan, and 1,600 yuan was received on the spot.</p>

<p>The hat-making workers in this city, due to the capitalists' excessive recruitment of apprentices and wage deductions, went on strike on the 5th. The City Social Bureau convened a mediation between labor and capital on the 8th, but there was no result.

The union immediately notified all workers to resume work on the date after receiving the order, and it is said that the workers still did not obey the order to resume work yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Declaration of Difficult Workers of Chunhua Rubber Factory <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The difficult workers of Chunhua Rubber Factory issued a declaration yesterday, and the following is an excerpt: Since the factory was burned down on December 23, 19, it has ignored the livelihood of more than 100 workers. After the workers repeatedly pleaded, they were unable to invite their pity. They were forced to apply to the City Social Bureau for mediation. The City Social Bureau mediated and was established on January 15, and the factory provided food until the start date and gave subsidies of 45 cents per person per day. However, the factory did not apply for arbitration during the specified period, and after the application for arbitration period, its true attitude was not clearly expressed. The workers had no choice but to sue the local court. After being summoned by the court, the factory was ordered to provide food first, and other parts were paid for investigation first. Later, the factory suddenly applied to the City Social Bureau for a second mediation. The workers thought that this procedure seemed to have little legal basis, but in order to take care of the feelings of both parties, they were not willing to insist. After the second mediation decision, in addition to maintaining the original state of providing food, all the subsidies of 45 cents per person per day were reduced to 2 cents per person per day. After the decision was made, the factory did not fulfill it, and when the workers applied for it, they instead instructed a large number of ruffians to seek revenge from the workers. The workers then listed the facts and submitted them to the City Public Security Bureau for filing. Since then, the workers have deeply felt that the factory cannot be reasoned with. All the compulsory savings of 5% of the wages and the due holiday wages and bonuses cannot be delayed any longer, so they applied to the City Social Bureau for the return. The City Social Bureau convened two mediations, but it has not been resolved today, and another meeting will be held. The workers lead the way and wait. However, the factory falsely accused the party and government organs, saying that the workers were illegally rioting, and secretly left their confidants, intending to undermine unity, and fortunately the party and government organs were clearly aware and not blinded. The workers' conscience was not destroyed, and they were not incited, and their plan ultimately failed. On the 7th of this month, the factory announced the start of work in advance. The workers heard the news and rushed to the factory to work. However, in addition to forcing the workers to sign and register, the factory also stated in the registration book that each person would receive a registration fee of 1 yuan, and would be paid after going to work, and stated that the registration fee would no longer be issued separately, and it would have to be paid within 4 hours, and no one would be allowed to leave the factory to borrow, and they would be immediately fired if they were overdue. The workers could not remain silent, so they publicly recommended two representatives to send the registration book to the Social Bureau for verification. The Social Bureau representative took the registration book and criticized the factory for excessive demands. The workers were in this environment, thinking of the past, and wanting to shed tears, and they did not know how to solve the problem in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Haiqi Compatriot Organization Forms a Support Association for Wronged People <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a moving appeal and declaration were issued to all sectors.</p>
<p>Yu Jingyu and others, fellow villagers from Haimen and Qidong counties residing in Shanghai, recently reported that their hometowns have been subjected to wanton arson and murder by bandits, with executions extending to ten families. The severity of the situation is unprecedented. Consequently, they have established the Haiqi Support Association for Wronged People at Nanhua Public School in Shanghai, seeking assistance from all sectors. The following is their moving appeal and declaration:</p>
<p>Moving Appeal to All Newspaper Offices and All Sectors: Please be aware that our counties, Haimen and Qidong, are located along the river and sea, blessed with abundant resources and prosperous livelihoods. The customs are honest and simple, and doors are not locked at night. During the Taiping Rebellion, families from various provinces sought refuge here, regarding Haimen and Qidong as havens of peace. However, since the dynastic change, natural disasters and man-made calamities have followed one after another. The old and weak fill the ditches, while the young and strong scatter in all directions. Some even resort to banditry due to hunger and cold. However, we have never heard of incidents involving people gathering in groups, armed with weapons, committing murder and robbery. Such events only began after our Party secured the Central Plains and began the suppression of communism. The tragedies have also started simultaneously. Consequently, both old and new evil forces, regardless of the extent of their power, can act perversely, disregarding the National Government's decree to protect human rights. Without legal procedures or evidence, they can arbitrarily carry out arson, murder, and executions based on their whims, fabricating reports. As a result, hundreds of cases have occurred in the past year. Posthumous executions extending to ten families and forced signatures are commonplace, with the number of those punished being ten or a hundred times greater. Their authority is unparalleled. Examining judicial and military law, the conviction and charges must be announced when killing a person, however they disregard this. Thus, under such accumulated power, 1.2 million people live in fear, like cicadas in winter, their lives at the mercy of others. Any resistance results in immediate death. Such cruel and brutal acts are taking place under the banner of the Republic, which is outrageous. We have been living in other places for many years, detached from our hometown affairs. In the past, when victimized families came to us with their grievances, we often dismissed them as deserving of their fate. But, the cycle of revenge has escalated and become more severe. Upon investigation, we found that some were bribed to be killed, others were framed on false charges, and some were burned to death in groups, their abdomens cut open, their hearts dug out, and their genitals burned. Most incomprehensibly, large groups of bandits openly roam the jurisdiction's territory armed daily, yet we have never heard of a single case being solved or a single person being killed. If this continues, not only will everyone be in danger, but what will be the end? It can be said that the gate of hell is continuously adding the souls of wronged spirits, and the census records are dwindling innocent people. Therefore, based on the fearless spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we resolutely established the Haiqi Support Association for Wronged People at Nanhua Public School in Shanghai. We have hired lawyers, published notices in newspapers, collected evidence, conducted thorough investigations, and submitted reports to the authorities, seeking security for the living and vindication for the dead. We are determined not to confuse right and wrong or prioritize personal gain over public interest. Alas, if this scourge is not eradicated, the people's suffering will not end. We are appealing to all sectors like Qin Ting in the court of Chu, earnestly begging for compassion for the helpless and providing powerful assistance. If this happens, our association will be fortunate, and the 1.2 million people of Haiqi will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Declaration: Our association, commiserating with the 1.2 million fellow villagers of Haimen and Qidong who are being trampled upon by old and new evil forces and living in dire straits, subjected to arson, murder, executions, opening abdomens, digging out hearts, and burning genitals, all at their whim, hereby, based on the National Government's decree to protect human rights, resolutely establishes the Haiqi Support Association for Wronged People. We have hired lawyers to collect evidence and conduct thorough investigations, submitting reports to the authorities for a thorough investigation, acting with impartiality, integrity, and indomitable spirit to seek security for the living and vindication for the dead. We will uphold the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, willing to sacrifice everything to fight a death match with the old and new evil forces. We will not be swayed by personal feelings, be greedy for money, condone wrongdoings, or abuse public office for private gain, nor will we start strongly and end weakly. Our goal of eliminating the communist bandits and overthrowing the old and new evil forces will not cease. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>A decision was made to first inquire with the Chinese-administered shelter.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the problem of beggars in the Public Concession has existed for a long time. The Municipal Council has considered the matter more than once through the Police Department. However, after being driven away, these beggars gradually sneak back, becoming increasingly annoying. The previous Municipal Council also raised the matter for consideration. A member of the committee investigating the beggar problem suggested that the beggar shelters in Zhabei and Nanshi were sufficient to accommodate these beggars. Subsequently, a Chinese council member proposed establishing a shelter in the Concession itself. The Chairman did not agree, fearing that it would attract beggars from neighboring areas. Several council members claimed that with strict management and the provision of work in a self-established shelter, beggars would be deterred from entering the Concession. Ultimately, it was decided to first inquire with the Chinese-administered beggar shelters regarding the conditions for also accepting beggars from the Concession before taking further action.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shanghai Banks Serve Rural Areas <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Cooperating with the China International Famine Relief Commission</p>
<p>Pilot Project for Farmers' Loans in Hebei Province</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has recently reached an agreement with the China International Famine Relief Commission to jointly implement a method for agricultural lending, starting with an initial investment of 20,000 yuan. Although a small amount, this marks the first time a Chinese bank has invested in agriculture, opening a new path for agricultural development in our country. The following is an account of this initiative: Since 1923, the China International Famine Relief Commission has promoted rural credit cooperatives in Hebei Province. Over the past eight years, cooperatives have been established in various counties, numbering over a thousand. Loans totaling over 220,000 yuan have been issued. Despite the absence of collateral, due to the high credit rating of each cooperative, there has not been a single loss. The reason for this success lies in the commission's pragmatism and the honesty and reliability of the farmers in Hebei. However, the commission's primary mission is disaster relief, and the funds available for cooperative ventures are limited. This type of economic assistance is crucial for agricultural development, and it is difficult to achieve long-term development without involving the financial sector. This spring, Chen Guangfu, the General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, traveled north and learned about the current state of rural credit cooperatives in Hebei. He believed that the opportunity to participate in agricultural development with tangible resources had arrived. He instructed Jin Zhongfan, the bank's parallel manager, to negotiate with the Famine Relief Commission. Recently, both parties signed a contract, with the following key points: (1) Assisting the commission in carrying out rural cooperative projects; (2) The loan amount will be based on the cooperative's assessment grade; (3) An initial allocation of 20,000 yuan will be entrusted to the commission for a pilot project, with future expansion planned; (4) The interest rate will be in accordance with the commission's regulations. It is reported that this cooperation agreement has already been implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Account of Li Hefei's Son Narrowly Escaping Danger <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The kidnappers made extensive prior arrangements.</p>
<p>They intended to act on the road.</p>
<p>He managed to escape by driving away quickly.</p>
<p>His Russian bodyguard was shot and injured.</p>
<p>Li Jingmai, son of Li Hongzhang of Hefei, was almost kidnapped on Hart Road yesterday morning. Fortunately, the car driver was quick-witted and drove away rapidly amidst the sound of smoke bombs, thus avoiding the danger. The bandits fired three shots, one hitting the windshield and two hitting the Russian bodyguard. They then drove away in a car that had been waiting nearby. The injured Russian was sent to the hospital for treatment and his life is feared to be in danger.</p>
<p>The flowers and trees are lush in the Pillow Stream Villa.</p>
<p>Li Jingmai is well-known in Shanghai for his real estate business. Brookside Apartments at 333 Hart Road is his innovative project. This building, known as the Pillow Stream Apartments in Chinese, is elegant and poetic. The towering buildings and summer pavilions are magnificent and unprecedented. Li resides in what he calls the Pillow Stream Villa, located west of the apartments at No. 441. The flowers and trees are lush, resembling a garden. Though called a villa, it is actually a grand structure. Li has long been targeted by criminals and always travels with a Russian bodyguard. Yesterday morning around 9:30, he drove out in his car, No. 244. He returned around 10:45 after running errands. His car was coming from Rue Massenet. Near the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Rue Amiral Bayle, he suddenly saw a collapsed cart blocking the way. One person was pulling while another was pushing, seemingly helping each other. Li's driver, Pavlov, immediately braked to wait for them to pass.</p>
<p>Encountering Kidnappers on the Road, the Bodyguard Injured</p>
<p>The collapsed cart, as it turned out, was a bundle of bamboo poles lying across the road, making it extremely inconvenient to pass. The movements of the two people pushing and pulling were also very slow. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard from behind the car. A bullet hit the car window, shattering the windshield. Then, another bullet hit the Russian bodyguard, Kosnai Chofu, in the shoulder. Kosnai stood up in pain, and a third bullet came from behind, hitting him in the lower waist. At this point, Li realized the situation was dire and ordered the driver, Pavlov, to drive away. Pavlov obeyed and sped off westward. The bandits continued to fire shots at the car from behind, but none hit their target.</p>
<p>Injuries to Vital Areas, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Li returned home and immediately called the police, who dispatched armed detectives to search the scene. However, the bandits had already fled. According to eyewitnesses, the bandits escaped in a car that had been waiting nearby, with the license plate number 1852. The injured Russian bodyguard, Kosnai Tafu, was taken to the Lester Chinese Hospital in a sick car for treatment. Although the bullets had been removed, he had lost too much blood and his injuries were in vital areas, making his life uncertain.</p>
<p>A Collapsed Cart with Twelve Bamboo Poles</p>
<p>Li Jingmai's residence at 441 Hart Road is located in the French Concession, while the incident occurred in the Public Concession. Afterwards, the Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched detectives to investigate. The number of kidnappers in this case is estimated to be five. The people pushing and pulling the collapsed cart were undoubtedly accomplices. The collapsed cart was very large, but it only carried twelve bamboo poles, which, when measured, were just long enough to block the street. Therefore, it is known that the bandits used this to obstruct Li's car.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Guochao's Account</p>
<p>According to Li's son, Mr. Li Guochao, who spoke to reporters, his father's outings are never fixed, and he always has a bodyguard with him to protect him in case of emergency. Recently, the Russian bodyguard asked for leave, so Kosnai Tafu replaced him. This morning, when accompanying his father, he did not carry a handgun. Because the incident happened suddenly, there was no way to deal with it. Being forced to do so, they could only drive away at full speed. When the bandits fired, the driver, Pavlov, wanted to draw his gun to fight back, but his father stopped him.</p>
<p>The Kidnappers' Plot Was Not a Day Old</p>
<p>Li Jingmai's reputation has attracted the attention of kidnappers for some time. Similar kidnapping attempts have occurred no less than four or five times. The most notable incident occurred last autumn when Li ordered his driver to deliver a letter. When returning, near the Red Cross Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour, a car suddenly sped out of a side street. There were six bandits in the car, and they were disappointed to see that Li's car was empty. However, threatening letters are received frequently.</p>
<p>The Family Situation of Li Jingmai</p>
<p>Li Jingmai, courtesy name Jigao, is 56 years old and the fourth son of Li Hongzhang. His eldest brother, Jingfang, courtesy name Boxing, currently resides in Tianjin. His other brothers have passed away. Li Jingmai served as an envoy to Austria during the Qing Dynasty, making a name for himself in his official career. After the dynastic change, he became a resident of Shanghai, specializing in real estate. He has many friends, and Westerners often address him as "Lord" to show respect for his ancestor's achievements. Li's son, Li Guochao, courtesy name Dinghou, is married and lives with his father in the Pillow Stream Villa. "Young master and old nobleman" can be used to describe the Li family.</p>

<p>Pitiful Xiuying, after taking poison,</p>
<p>Sat silently, tears falling like rain.</p>
<p>Treatment was unsuccessful, and her life was extinguished.</p>
<p>Eight suicide notes, filled with sadness.</p>
<p>A certain Mr. Mo, residing at No. 22, Lane 3, Lao Tianxiang Li, Rue Amiral Courbet in the French Concession, has four sons and three daughters, with a modest family fortune. Except for the youngest son, all are employed in society. The third daughter is married to a Mr. Ma. The eldest daughter is still unmarried. The second daughter, Xiuying, is 23 years old and a literate female student. Her parents, seeing her studious nature, quiet personality, and intelligence beyond ordinary people, loved her dearly. However, ten years ago, based on her parents' orders and the matchmaker's words, she was betrothed to the eldest son of the Wang family in Minhang. However, the Wang household was also an old-fashioned family, and the eldest son was pedantic and unable to understand worldly affairs. Although the parents of both sides allowed the engaged couple to meet, Xiuying ultimately found it difficult to connect with him and was unhappy. She repeatedly asked her parents to break off the engagement with the Wang family so that she could continue her studies, but both sets of parents refused. This year, the Wang family had already chosen an auspicious day for the wedding. The mother was afraid that Xiuying would do something unexpected, so she confined her at home, forbidding her from going out. At this point, Xiuying felt increasingly distressed. She wanted to discuss it with her brother, but he was working outside and difficult to meet. Therefore, she pitied herself and found life tasteless. On the night before last (the 7th), around 9 pm, she suddenly had a suicidal thought and secretly took poison. After taking the poison, she went upstairs with her younger brother and sat silently. Her brother was reading beside her and initially did not notice anything unusual. After a while, he suddenly saw that his sister's face was abnormal and tears were streaming down her face. He tried to comfort her, but she did not respond and continued to cry. Around 12 o'clock, he saw that his sister's face had turned pale, and her eyes seemed dull. Her tears had gradually dried up. He finally realized something was wrong and told his mother, who immediately ordered a servant to take her to the hospital for treatment. However, all four hospitals said they could not save her and had to bring her home. Before she arrived home, her life was extinguished, and she left the world forever. The funeral was held yesterday morning, and the coffin was taken out at 3 pm. It is also said that before committing suicide, Xiuying had written eight suicide notes to her brother and close friends, filled with sad words. Everyone who read them felt sorry for her and mourned together.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Municipal Council Does Not Approve of Buying the Paramount Hotel <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a special declaration was issued.</p>
<p>Stating several reasons.</p>
<p>The proposal to nationalize the land of the Paramount Hotel in western Shanghai was recently included in the agenda of the foreign taxpayers' annual meeting on the 15th of this month at the request of Mr. Harris, a foreign taxpayer. The Municipal Council yesterday issued a statement on the matter, saying that recently many people have suggested that the Municipal Council should buy the land of the Paramount Hotel, and many have written to newspapers to express their opinions. The land covers an area of 58.593 mu, and the owner is willing to sell it to the Municipal Council for 3.5 million yuan, with the deadline being the 30th of this month. The Municipal Council has carefully considered this proposal. Because this matter is of great public concern and will involve a huge amount of public funds, it is necessary to publish the facts and the attitude of the authorities on this matter. Those who advocate purchasing this land have proposed many uses, but they can be divided into three categories: (1) Moving the municipal government offices to the new site and using the funds obtained from selling the old site to offset the cost of purchasing the new property; (2) Using it as a cultural and social center; (3) Using it as a park or square. Regarding the first point, moving the municipal government offices from the current convenient location in the city center to a new location one and a half miles west will cause significant inconvenience in handling public affairs. This action is unwise, and the buildings where the municipal government offices are currently located can still be used for many years and have plenty of room for expansion. After the Shanghai Electric Power Company moves to its new building on Nanjing Road in October of this year, there will be immediate relief. Furthermore, after the current Central Police Station and fire brigade are demolished and moved to new buildings near Fuzhou Road, even more space will be freed up for considerable expansion and development. The second suggestion is vague. If you want to concentrate administrative and public agencies in one place, the land is too small and the cost is too high. After the Central Police Station and fire brigade move to the new site, the municipal government and library will have plenty of room to build. Whether the Paramount property should be purchased as a park should be considered in conjunction with the broader issue of establishing parks and squares in the concession. Today, the addition of parks and squares in the concession is the most urgent task. However, it is extremely difficult to find a suitable location at a reasonable price. The Municipal Council has proposed forming a committee to develop a large-scale plan for adding parks and squares to meet the needs of all residents in the concession. The northern district has the highest population density and the greatest need, so the Municipal Council decided last summer to add them there first. In the western district, a site of 25 acres has already been purchased and will be used as a park in the future. Therefore, the Municipal Council is now focusing on adding recreational facilities to the densely populated northern and eastern districts. Moreover, it is questionable what the actual benefit of spending 3.5 million taels to purchase the Paramount property would be. Perhaps adding two or three squares in densely populated areas with lower land prices would benefit more of the city's residents. Moreover, from a real estate perspective, the Paramount area is rapidly becoming the area with the highest land prices. The Municipal Council does not recognize its special value as a park, and its existing buildings are completely unsuitable for use as a city hall. In terms of the Municipal Council's financial position, purchasing this property is only a small part of the larger plan to add parks and squares, but the large amount will limit the progress of adding parks in more densely populated areas. The Municipal Council also has to consider education, hospitals, and other needs. Moreover, the Municipal Council's current financial position is somewhat artificial. The low tax rate is entirely due to the sale of the electricity division. Once this money is used up, it will be in a difficult position. Therefore, all non-essential expenditures must be avoided. Purchasing the Paramount property is sufficient to hinder the addition of parks in more densely populated areas, and the estimated annual recurring expenses will increase by 250,000 taels, which will be a powerful factor in promoting future tax increases. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Municipal Council believes that it cannot approve this action and believes that its current financial position is not suitable for frequently adding this huge amount to the budget and hindering the progress of other more urgent plans.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs burned confiscated opium at Lujiazui in Pudong. The Chief of the Customs Warehouse Transportation Department, a Westerner named Roberts, and the Tax Inspector's interpreter, Ge Yixin, supervised the transportation of confiscated goods, numbered thirty-seven items, across the river with the representative of the Supervisory Office, Yang Chongshi, and more than a dozen Chinese and Western customs officials. The goods were weighed and checked against the account books, and each item was verified. At 9 am, two kilns were lit simultaneously to begin burning. By noon, the burning was completed. A total of 30 dan, 2 jin, and 14 liang of opium from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Persia (i.e., red opium) were destroyed, with an estimated value of 140,954 yuan and 2 jiao and 3 fen.

In addition, there was also a large wooden box containing obscene books such as "Sexual History" and "The True Story of a Rake," as well as prohibited almanacs and blank money orders, which were also burned. More than 400 counterfeit pistols, as well as opium lamps, shades, and pipes, were smashed with sledgehammers by laborers. The above-mentioned contraband items were seized by customs officers on various ships from December 21, 1920 to March 20, 1921. Supervisors from various agencies, including Ye Liangguang from the Songhu Garrison Command, Zhang Yinhuai from the Municipal Government, Ju Zhijing from the Special District Court, Wang Zhizhong from the Local Court, Fan Ander and Duan Zhenfen from the Anti-Drug Association, Director Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, specially dispatched Section Member Lin Tao, and Zhang Mingqin, the Third District Chief, supervised the armed police platoon at the scene.

<p>The court ordered a postponement of seven days for further hearing.</p>
<p>Ordered the defendants to report to the case in person.</p>
<p>Gu Qiaolin and Wang A'mei, concubines of the late paint tycoon Xue Baorun, have successively filed lawsuits in the French court to divide the property. Just as one wave subsided, another wave rose. Recently, Hua Lihou, Xue Baorun's son-in-law, accompanied by his two sons, Yi Hong and Yi Gu, and his daughter, Man Yun, sued his mother-in-law, Sun, and his brothers-in-law, Gan Sheng, Yan Sheng, Jia Sheng, and Gen Sheng, in the French court, demanding the division of the estate. The defendants were not present at yesterday's hearing, and lawyer Lin Yingqing appeared on their behalf, claiming that the notice of this case was only delivered the day before yesterday, which happened to be a holiday, and the defendants had gone out for sightseeing and had not yet returned to Shanghai, requesting an extension for debate. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendants were actually in Shanghai and had not left, and were intentionally avoiding appearing in court. Not only were they absent from this case, but they had consistently avoided appearing in court in other cases. It has recently been discovered that the defendants intend to take the opportunity to sell off the property. Therefore, they requested that the court grant a provisional seizure of the Xue family's property to prevent losses. Judge Gong ordered a postponement of seven days and ordered the defendants to appear in court in person for further hearing.</p>

<p>The law has a special clause for falsely accusing someone of theft.</p>
<p>Yu Huilin was sentenced to three months in prison.</p>
<p>Boatman Yu Huilin returned to his residence at No. 42, Taian Li, North Fujian Road from Waibu the day before yesterday. As he approached his door, he encountered a rogue named Lu Xiaomaotou. Lu tried to search him, but Yu refused. A conflict ensued, and Lu's accomplices ganged up on him and said that if they met again, they would not spare him. After speaking, they scattered. Yu returned home and, although he felt that he had not been harmed this time, he could not guarantee that they would not seek revenge in the future. Wanting to take preemptive action, he reported to the Huizi Police Station, falsely claiming that he had been surrounded by four or five thieves in Taian Li, including one named Lu Xiaomaotou, who threatened him with a handgun and forbade him from making noise, while the others searched him and robbed him of 5,000 yuan in cash. However, after the chief detective sent investigators, it was discovered that it was a false report motivated by revenge, which is not allowed by law. Yu was arrested and sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning, charged with false accusation. Yu also admitted to falsely reporting the robbery, saying that he wanted to scare Lu to prevent him from becoming violent in the future. Judge Ge said that if Yu had been innocently assaulted, he could have reported it to the police truthfully. Instead, he acted impulsively and falsely accused someone of theft, which was a well-deserved crime. Therefore, he immediately sentenced Yu Huilin to three months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Mute Love Film Public Lawsuit <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Defendant's Lawyer's Six Reasons</p>
<p>Debate Concludes, Verdict in Fifteen Days</p>
<p>Because the Xifan Film Company produced the mute love film on behalf of the Shishi Film Company, involving Wu Airong's stepmother, Wu Yangshi, and her brother, Wu Baolun, Wu Yangshi and others filed a private lawsuit in the local court against Ren Xifan, Chen Zhuomin, Zhang Fukang, and others for insult and defamation. Yesterday, Judge Qian Chengjun continued the hearing. The judge asked Ren Xifan where Ran Zhongfen of the Shishi Film Company had gone. He replied, "Hong Kong and then Nanyang." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Shen Chuqing, requested the court to order Ren's arrest. The judge said, "Since Liang is the nominal defendant, the warrant is valid. Even if the defendant does not appear, a verdict can be rendered. There are ways." The judge questioned the lawyer, "Regarding the indictment against the Shishi Film Company, it only mentions the company's name and not Liang's name, which is not legal." The lawyer stated, "This is a legal entity." The judge said, "In criminal cases, natural persons should be used. In civil lawsuits, legal entities can be used, so the indictment should be supplemented." The lawyer agreed. The judge then asked Ren Xifan, "Regarding Lin Jim and Wu Airong, did you invite them, or did they come voluntarily?" He replied, "They came to the Shishi Company requesting filming. Because Shishi had no venue, they entrusted my company to film it on their behalf." The judge asked, "How many times was it shown in Shanghai?" He replied, "Nine times. Lin and Wu performed on stage at the Guang Stage before coming to film." The judge asked Chen Zhuomin, "Was it for publicity at the Xifan Company?" Chen replied, "Yes, for publicity in newspapers." The judge asked Zhang Fukang, "I was the photographer. The facts inside depended on the instructions of director Chen Zhuomin." The judge asked Wu Yangshi and Wu Baolun, "They requested incidental civil compensation of three thousand taels of silver, to be borne jointly by the two companies." The judge then questioned the defendants, who were unwilling to compensate. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Shen, stated, "In the film, the mute and Airong met through Wu Baolin. The 'Lin' character in Wu Baolin's name sounds the same as 'Lun' in the Cantonese dialect. The plaintiff is Airong's stepmother. The explanation states that Wu Airong could not bear the stepmother's beatings, so she followed Hongfu's elopement. It clearly points to the stepmother driving her away. The successful marriage was also due to Wu Baolin's mediation. This is a serious insult. According to Articles 324, 325, and 328 of the criminal law, Ren Xifan, Chen Zhuomin, and Zhang Fukang should be subject to appropriate criminal penalties. As for Liang Zhongfen of the Shishi Film Company, who has not appeared, we request his arrest. In the civil part, they showed the film, which affected the plaintiffs' personality and reputation, and they should naturally compensate," etc. The defendant's lawyer, Wu Chengyu, stated, "(1) The plaintiff is suing for two crimes, insult and defamation. According to the study of criminal law, one act cannot constitute two crimes. The plaintiff's and the agent's views are already wrong. (2) The defendants do not know the plaintiffs. Lin Jim and Wu Airong wrote out the facts, and the name of the stepmother was not mentioned. In any case, the sounds of Lin and Lun cannot be the same. There is no crime without intentional conduct. (3) Is it a disgraceful thing for Wu Yangshi as a stepmother to beat her son? This is like parents teaching their children. Wu Baolin introduced Lin Jim to Airong and mediated their marriage. According to the new morality, it is a free marriage. According to the old morality, Wu Airong remained faithful to one person until the end, which is not a disgraceful thing. (4) Wu Airong and Lin Jim appeared in court to prove these facts. According to Article 325, those who can prove the facts are not punished. Regarding private morality, a mother beating her daughter is a virtue in the old morality. The film is a news report on old families and has nothing to do with public interest. (5) The plaintiff is a stepmother. If the film is not shown, Airong will have no means of support. Therefore, the child born has to be sent to the hall. Anyone with a conscience would not file a lawsuit. (6) Can the facts in the film be considered a well-intentioned and appropriate comment? Therefore, the public prosecution is innocent, and the private prosecution is naturally not established." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated again, "Ren Xifan claimed that he printed the advertisement, which proves defamation. The defendant's defender said that only one crime can be made. If the defendant's criminal facts are many, the court can only judge one crime, which is too unreasonable. This is an infringement of personal legal rights and has nothing to do with the public. Is women's virtue not related to private morality? Therefore, the film must be requested to be revoked and confiscated. The private lawsuit clearly infringes on the personality of others. According to Article 16 of the civil law, the private lawsuit should not be invalid just because the public prosecution is not established." The defendant's lawyer stated again, "Private morality is private morality that cannot be told to others. Therefore, this issue is still about women's virtue." At this point, the judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th of this month. The court adjourned.</p>

<p>Gu Yutian, a Cantonese, lives at No. 381, Qingyun Lane, North Sichuan Road. At about 6 p.m. last night, Gu returned home from the Guangzhao Villa in Zhabei. He entered the house through the back door and saw two strangers in the room, whose appearance was very suspicious. Gu could not help but shout that there were robbers. This was heard by the Chinese police officer No. 939 of the Hongkou Patrol Room, who went to the scene following the sound. The two bandits had already climbed onto the roof and fled to the roof of No. 1, Qipu Road, next door. The Chinese police ordered them to come down and raise their hands, but the two refused. The police then opened fire, resulting in both being injured and unable to move. At this time, the Hongkou Patrol Room also heard the news and sent Chinese and foreign police officers in cars to the scene. They immediately took the two to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. Both were injured in the thigh and were all Cantonese.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Large-Scale Market to Appear on Nanjing Road <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>New Building of the Shanghai Trust Department of the Continental Bank</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai Trust Department of the Continental Bank has seen exceptional development in its trust business. Trust deposits have guaranteed interest and profit sharing, which is better than any other deposit. It is heard that the department is using its funds to build a large-scale market at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Wangping Street in this port. The site covers more than nine acres, bordering the main road to the north, Wangping Street to the east, Second Malu Road to the south, and Youxin Street to the west, facing the air on all sides, which is the most prosperous place for business. The architectural plan is designed by architect Zhuang Jun. Along the main road, there are about three hundred feet, with the main entrance of the market in the center, totaling eight floors. The two sides are six floors. At the corner of Wangping Street, there is a magnificent tower top. Along Wangping Street and Second Malu Road, there are more than three hundred feet each, all five floors. A T-shaped road is opened in the middle, still using the original name of Buddha Street. The north, south, and east sides all have wide entrances for cars to pass through without obstruction. In addition to the shops on the three sides of the main road, Wangping Street, and Second Malu Road, the two sides in the middle of the T-shaped road are also arranged with shops, with superior locations and prosperous traffic on three sides. The second, third, and fourth floors are all used as markets, with each storefront having a passage of more than two yards wide, surrounding the area according to the terrain, with access everywhere. The rent is cheaper than the shops downstairs, which is suitable for the needs of medium-capital businesses. From the fifth floor upwards, it is designated as office space. On the Second Malu Road side, it can also be used for apartments. At the entrance on the main road, there are two elevators. At the entrances on Wangping Street and Second Malu Road, there is one elevator each. There are also five or six stone staircases, which can ensure safety. A garden is arranged on the roof for viewing. Iron frames are placed in the high places facing the air, tilted outwards, specifically for installing high-end electric light advertisements. The most meaningful part of the plan is on the Second Malu Road side, where a lane is specially opened to preserve a hotel with historical connections, so that those who love antiquity will not feel a sense of vicissitudes, which shows the department's painstaking efforts in planning. It is heard that this project has already started, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year. There will be a new atmosphere in the eastern part of the main road.</p>

<p>Tenants' Association Distributes Declaration</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reported that the rent of the houses in Renshou Lane, Beikai'er Road, in this city, increased by one and a half yuan per building in April last year. Recently, the manager of the lane suddenly notified the tenants that from April of this year, the rent must be increased by 30%. All the tenants in the lane believe that this rent increase is completely unreasonable, and increasing the rent every year puts too much burden on the tenants. Therefore, they unanimously opposed it and sent a letter to the manager of the lane, requesting that the rent increase be canceled and that the old amount be collected. Fearing oppression, they hired lawyers Li Aokui and Wu Chengyu as permanent legal advisors to protect them. Yesterday, a special declaration was distributed, requesting all sectors to uphold public opinion, with a length of about a thousand words. The original text is omitted.</p>

<p>Zhou Miaoying, the divorced concubine of the late rich man Zhang Shiming of Nanxun, had previously been involved in a lawsuit with her biological son Zhang Quji and Zhang Xu, Zhang Shiming's wife. Later, it was peacefully resolved, and a contract was signed, in which Quji gave Zhou 40,000 gold to sever all relations with the Zhang family. Last winter, Xu held a wedding for her son, and Zhou came out to interfere. Recently, she filed a lawsuit with the Special Zone Local Court, requesting a judgment to confirm the mother-son relationship between Quji. The defendant hired lawyers Justi and Jiang Yiping to present a defense based on the previously signed contract. Judge Xu Wenrong had concluded the debate in court a few days ago. Yesterday morning was the date for the verdict. Both parties did not personally appear in court, but were represented by lawyers at the Seventh Tribunal to wait for instructions. Judge Xu then took the seat and read out the main text of the judgment, rejecting the plaintiff's lawsuit. The litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff.

<p>Cai Fulin, a comprador of the British-American Tobacco Company, was kidnapped by bandits twice. The bandits led by Ye Ruchun who kidnapped Cai for the second time were sentenced to imprisonment by the Special Zone Local Court a few days ago. The sentences received by each bandit have been recorded in this newspaper. The bandits who kidnapped Cai for the first time had already been sentenced earlier.

Therefore, the branch court reopened the trial. Yesterday afternoon, the verdict was announced, revoking the original sentence and changing it to seven years of fixed-term imprisonment. However, it is heard that the patrol room is still considering this judgment and may appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Tan Zhu, who lives at No. 70, Long Lane, Kangnaught Road, filed a lawsuit against Tan Xiaodi in the Special Zone Court a few days ago for the crime of injury. The complaint stated, "For malicious injury, please conduct an examination." She was married to the defendant in the winter of the Republic of China year two by her parents. At that time, she was only nineteen years old and had not yet developed her knowledge. After entering the door, her in-laws said that the defendant's temperament was always violent and abusive, and her parents could not control him. After the death of her in-laws, the defendant sold the fields and houses and squandered them arbitrarily. Later, he forced her to give him her wages, which was also of no avail. Unexpectedly, one night in April of this year, they had a verbal argument, and he dragged her off the bed and violently chopped her head with a butcher knife. She immediately reported it to the Gordon Road Patrol Room and was transferred to Renji Hospital. Fortunately, she did not die. The defendant's violent nature has repeatedly committed violence with a knife. I have no choice but to ask your court to conduct an examination according to law.</p>

Unfortunately, he passed away last year, leaving behind one son and one daughter, and an adopted son named Lianfang. The defendant is already married. The plaintiff married a Shen in the fifteenth year. At that time, there was a war, and the dowry had not been purchased. My late father repeatedly stated that he would replenish it when he had the financial resources, but four years have passed without implementation. Repeatedly requested the defendant to perform, but there was no response. I have no choice but to file a division based on the law of female inheritance, requesting that the defendant open up the property and divide it according to the service."</p>

<p>Xu Xiuting, the owner of the Dachang Automobile Factory opened in Datiebang, the French Concession of this port, is nearly half a century old, with a stalwart physique and abnormal obesity. His children have grown up, his eldest son is twenty-seven years old, and his daughter is also married. Xu, because his wife has passed away, is not accustomed to living alone. He is as vigorous as a young man, so he asked a friend to act as an agent and hired a Wang woman as his successor. The Wang woman is young and just old enough to wear a hairpin, and has graduated from a certain school. Her character is very elegant. This time the marriage was entirely decided by her brother. Xu was overjoyed to learn that the woman was young and a school graduate. He chose the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road on the eighth of this month (the day before yesterday) as the place for the wedding, with lanterns and colored streamers, bright and splendid. The guests were full, and it was very lively. Wine banquets were set up all over the hall, and the sounds of Sheng and songs filled the ears. The Kun residence was borrowed from Yipinxuan, a short distance away, making it convenient to travel to and fro. Unexpectedly, when the bridal sedan chair went to pick her up, the bride was late to get into the sedan chair. The auspicious time had passed, and the matchmaker could not do anything. The groom longed for the bride and was inexplicably anxious. Until the clock struck twelve at night, the bridal sedan chair still did not arrive. The general guests waited, and all were amazed. There were people who went to the Kun residence to inquire, and it was said that the bride was wearing a flannel shirt, sitting in the room, holding a newspaper and flipping through it, her attitude calm, as if nothing had happened. Someone whispered to her, but she remained silent. The Gan residence guests waited until about 1:30 a.m. yesterday, and there was still no news, so they returned one after another, all marveling endlessly.</p>

<p>The Kodak Company at No. 24 Yuanmingyuan Road has launched the World Photography Competition with a prize of 100,000 US dollars, which has been highly praised by celebrities from all countries. Mr. Tang Shaoyi, a veteran of our Chinese party and state, also enthusiastically supports and promotes it. Therefore, the number of people who learn photography and join the competition is increasing rapidly. The sales of the company's yellow box film have also soared a thousand times, increasing tenfold. The advantages of Kodak film are numerous, such as fast light sensitivity, non-rigid brightness, consistent quality, and have long been praised by photographers and are happy to use. With the consumption of this photography competition, it is no wonder that its sales are increasing day by day. Moreover, at a time when the exchange rate is extremely high and costs are expensive, the company has reduced the selling price by a quarter to ease the burden on those who learn photography and allow them to use it as much as possible. Its enthusiasm for sacrifice is evident. It is heard that letters from distributors from all over the world are coming in droves, and there is a tendency for them to be sold out.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Ministry of Education Explains Matters Regarding Educational Associations <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to clarify the use of "report" and telegrams by educational associations when communicating with education bureaus, has issued a directive to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Recently, the Jilin Provincial Education Department forwarded a telegram from Panshi County stating that the old regulations for educational associations stipulated that county educational associations were subordinate to the education bureau. The newly promulgated Educational Association Law stipulates that county educational associations are supervised by the county government. The telegram asks whether communications from the provincial educational association to the education bureau should be changed to official letters for compliance. The Ministry has investigated and found that Article 10 of the Educational Association Law stipulates that the supervisory bodies for county educational associations and their subordinate district educational associations are the county government. However, the county education bureau is part of the government organization and, when necessary, may supervise the county educational association and its district educational associations on behalf of the county government. Communications between them should still use "report" except for instructions. This directive is hereby issued for your information and for transmission to your subordinates. The Ministry of Education (seal). Furthermore, although the Ministry of Education ordered that educational associations be established by the end of March, due to changes in the organization and reorganization methods, the deadline has been extended. Some provinces and cities have not yet fully organized and established their educational associations, and the Ministry of Education continues to receive requests for clarification of doubts from various provinces and cities. The following is a summary of the key points: (1) Can county educational association officers mutually elect one person as a standing officer? The Educational Association Law does not explicitly stipulate or restrict this. For the sake of convenience, it should be permissible for the officers to mutually elect one person as a standing officer. Similarly, district and municipal educational associations may follow the example of county educational associations and have their officers mutually elect a standing officer, and this should be stipulated in the association's constitution to ensure uniformity. (2) Places that have not been designated as cities by the state in accordance with Article 4 of the Municipal Organization Law and do not have a municipal government may not establish municipal educational associations. (3) Teachers and staff of public and private schools at all levels and personnel of educational institutions in provincial capitals may join the district educational associations within the county where the provincial capital is located as members.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Zhejiang Province Holds Educational Design Committee Meeting <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education held its first Educational Design Committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 8th in the department's auditorium. Attendees included Yu Ziyi, Yu Qingtang, Meng Xiancheng, Zheng Xiaocang, Tan Xihong, Li Ximou, Fu Baochen, Yang Baokang, Luo Yun, Xie Yun, Wei Songtang, Ye Suzhong, Xu Shaodi, Xiang Dingrong, Zhang Daoshen, Shen Fubao, Qian Jiazhi, Xiong Wenmin, Luo Dixian, Zhao Mian, Zhang Yiyang, Zhang Xingjian, and Zhang Rentian. Observers included Hu Mengzi, Fang Zuzhen, Zhao Yuren, Zhao Yuyu, and Sun Fuhou. Zhang Daofan chaired the meeting. After the usual formalities, Zhang Daofan gave an opening speech, stating that education is a public undertaking related to the construction of the party and the nation. It is necessary to solicit opinions from people outside the department who are well-versed in various educational issues and jointly discuss solutions in order to integrate and develop the whole. This meeting, if successful, will, on a small scale, provide substantial solutions to various educational problems in Zhejiang Province, and on a large scale, provide a reference for the educational situation in this province for the entire country to consider. He earnestly requested that all gentlemen report and discuss their daily thoughts and the needs and actual situation of education in Zhejiang Province, express their high opinions, and jointly promote the cause of education. Next, Shen Fuzhai reported on the content of the committee's proposed plans, which were originally divided into eleven groups. However, due to time constraints, the focus of the discussions will be on the secondary education group, the education funding group, and the social education group. Other areas, such as primary education, vocational education, and women's education, will also be discussed to improve them. It was proposed that the schedule be as follows: On the morning of the first day, the group method for all agenda items will be decided. In the afternoon and on the morning of the second day, group meetings will be held. On the third day, based on the results of the group meetings, a plenary meeting will be held to make final overall decisions. The group meetings then began, and it was decided to divide the groups into secondary education, social education, and education funding. Each person was responsible for deciding which group to join. As a result, the secondary education group consisted of ten people: Meng Xiancheng, Xiong Wenmin, Zheng Xiaocang, Li Ximou, Yu Ziyi, Luo Yun, Yang Baokang, Tan Xihong, Shen Fuzhai, and Xie Xue. The social education group consisted of five people: Fu Hezhen, Yu Qingtang, Zhao Mian, Zhang Rentian, and Ye Suzhong. The education funding group consisted of seven people: Wei Songtang, Qian Jiazhi, Zhang Xingjian, Luo Dixian, Xiang Dingrong, Xu Shaodi, and Zhang Yiyang. The secondary education group had fourteen proposals, the social education group had five proposals, and the education funding group had five proposals. The plenary meeting discussed these matters until noon, when it was temporarily adjourned. Group meetings began in the afternoon. (This report is from our local correspondent.)</p>
<h3 id="e171">Shanghai Middle School Affiliated Elementary School Reports on Elementary School Curriculum Standards <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Results of Experimentation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Affiliated Elementary School of Jiangsu Province on Shangwen Road in this city has always been very interested in experimentation and research in new education. This time, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to all provinces to quickly report the results of the trial implementation of the "Provisional Standards for Primary and Secondary School Curricula" for the Ministry of Education's reference in revising these standards. Upon receiving the order, the school immediately reported the school's research and experimentation process for these curriculum standards. The original report is excerpted below. The school's experimentation and research on the provisional standards for the primary school curriculum was conducted in three aspects: First, based on the teaching experience of the school's colleagues, detailed criticisms were made. Second, the current primary school textbooks for each subject were analyzed and compared with the provisional curriculum standards to carefully examine their gains and losses. Third, scientific methods were used to test whether the teaching methods introduced by the provisional curriculum standards were consistent with reality. After three semesters of experimentation and research, some gains were made. The following is a summary of the key points of the assignments and teaching methods: 1. Regarding the key points of assignments for each subject: (1) In the third and fourth grades of the Chinese language writing class, the item of learning simplified cursive script should be deleted. The reason is that the children's regular script performance in the third and fourth grades is poor, and it is feared that practicing cursive script will further reduce their regular script progress. (2) In the fifth and sixth grades of the social studies class, an item on career guidance should be added. The reason is that, according to the actual situation, few primary school graduates continue their education, and most of them find employment, so it is appropriate to implement career guidance to prepare them for employment. (3) In the fifth and sixth grades of the arithmetic class, an item on the recognition and calculation of various simple bills should be added. The reason is that this material is necessary for social life. (4) In the third and fourth grades of the arithmetic class, an item on the recognition of Roman numerals and tally marks should be added. The reason is that these numbers are still commonly used in society. (5) In the first and second grades of the arithmetic class, an item on the nine-nine multiplication table practice for multiplication and division involving zero should be added. The reason is that the provisional curriculum standards only have addition and subtraction nine-nine tables involving zero, but not multiplication and division nine-nine tables involving zero. However, the current arithmetic textbooks have them, so it seems that they can be adopted. 2. Regarding the key points of teaching methods for each subject: (1) In the Chinese language class for senior grades, children can be asked to write diaries. The reason is that, according to comparative experimental results, practicing expression through diaries is more effective than regular composition assignments. (2) Chinese language composition papers should be carefully graded. The reason is that, according to comparative experimental results, teachers using grading methods for children's writing exercises are more effective than so-called guidance methods. (3) In Chinese language calligraphy teaching, emphasis should be placed on regular practice. The reason is that, according to comparative experimental results, children should practice writing regularly rather than opportunistically. (4) In Chinese language reading teaching, children should be asked to memorize short vernacular articles. The reason is that, according to comparative experimental results, mastering short vernacular articles greatly benefits the understanding and expression of words. (5) The arrangement of teaching materials for the arithmetic class should use a circular method. The reason is that, according to comparative experimental results, teaching materials arranged using the circular method are more effective. (6) The teaching of arithmetic mental calculation should be based on children's calculation ability and the steps should be properly determined, from easy to complex. The reason is that, according to comparative experimental results, if mental calculation problems are beyond children's calculation ability, their effectiveness will be minimal. In summary, the above are the results of the school's experimentation and research on the provisional curriculum standards, and are matters not yet discussed in these standards. Other matters, such as the application of inductive methods in the teaching of arithmetic principles, the focus on facts in arithmetic propositions, and the emphasis on stroke order guidance in calligraphy teaching, are the results of the school's teaching experiments and are consistent with the provisional curriculum standards, so they will not be discussed in detail. Only those that are not included in the standards are listed above for your review and transmission to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Shanghai International Boy Scout Performance <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Jewish Boy Scouts' "Shanghai Architecture" Wins</p>
<p>The Chinese Jinan University Team's "Mutual Aid" Wins Applause from the Entire Audience</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the annual meeting of the International Boy Scouts of this city was held at 2:30 PM on the 6th at the Millington Field on Hongqiao Road. Over 400 people participated, including the representative of the municipal department, Tong Xingbai (represented by Wang Gang), representatives of the municipal Boy Scout Council, Wang Gang, Zhang Xunfang, and Shen Yu, representatives of the Boy Scout Associations of various countries, guests, and others. The performers included Boy Scouts from seven countries. The Chinese Boy Scouts participating were the 64th Troop (Jinan University) and the 221st Troop (Shanghai University). The performances on that day included camping, fire starting, house building, dressing, rescue, flag signals, martial arts, and many other activities. As a result of the judging, the Jewish team won and received three silver shields presented by the Municipal Boy Scout Council, the Rotary Club, and the former British Consul General. The 64th Chinese Boy Scout Troop received a New Moon Shield from the Bunnemann Company. Finally, Wang Gang, the representative of the municipal department, and Millington, the British Consul General, delivered speeches in their respective national languages. The performances of the Chinese and Jewish teams are excerpted below.</p>
<p>The Chinese Team (Jinan University) performed a piece entitled "Mutual Aid". Several dozen Boy Scouts, dressed as people from various countries, including farmers, merchants, soldiers, were painted on their hands, feet, and faces in various colors, including red, black, and white, and wore tattered clothes of various colors. They first walked and danced around the field for a week, and then performed Boy Scout activities such as rescue, flag signals, stacking, and various games. The performance expressed the spirit of love among all nations through mutual aid. The performance was quite humorous and interesting, and won a lot of applause from the audience. The Jewish team performed a piece entitled "Shanghai Architecture". First, they erected a five-legged archway with the flags of seven countries attached to the table. In the middle was a horizontal picture of the Shanghai Bund from twenty years ago. Then, they stacked some high-rise buildings on the return trip, and added several warships to the Huangpu River, just like the Bund scenery of today. Although this performance was original, the deep meaning of flattering the aggression of various countries against China made our hair stand on end. Can we not regard this as a great shame? We sincerely hope that the people of the country will rise up to avenge it.</p>

<h3 id="e181">A Glimpse of the Fisheries Exhibition Department <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing the gradual decline of China's coastal fisheries and the intentional aggression of foreigners, believes that if improvements are not made, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, it has joined forces with the Department of Agriculture and Mining, as well as provincial and municipal party headquarters, to organize a Fisheries Propaganda Association to awaken fellow citizens and jointly seek development. On Sunday, I took time to visit and tour the exhibition department for a week. Here are my observations:</p>
<p>In the main hall of the exhibition department, there is a horizontal banner with the eleven characters "Strive to Complete the Premier's Fisheries Port Plan" hanging. Below it hangs a map of the Premier's Fisheries Port Plan, drawn on a full-width bamboo cloth. Beside it are couplets: "Enrich the sea and develop new strategies, benefit the country and the people, techniques surpass Guan Zhong"; "Maintain the auspicious dream of expansion, care for the masses' well-being, the duty lies with Yu Ren." The four walls are covered with slogans such as "China's import and export of marine products lose more than 20 million taels annually," "The fisheries association is the basic organization of fishermen," "The ocean is an infinite treasure trove," and "Shanghai is the great fishing port of the Orient." The first room displays fish specimens from the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experimental Station. There are over a hundred glass bottles of various sizes, all filled with liquid preservatives and tightly sealed. A description is attached to the outside of each bottle, detailing the name in both Chinese and Western languages. On the wall is a chemical composition table of important edible fish (noting moisture, protein, fat, and ash weight), and a table showing the growth rate of farmed fish (divided into freshwater and saltwater, and weight and body length), as well as a table showing the spawning period of important fish (noted by month), one for each. The second room displays shrimp, crabs, snails, and other shellfish. There are candlestick shrimp and bamboo shrimp. There are many types of crabs, called cross crab, shuttle crab, ghost-face crab, shy woman crab, ginkgo crab, three-star crab, and Zhang Fei crab. Some have a shape similar to a shuttle, some have three stars on their backs, some have shells like ghost faces, and some have a shape like Zhang Fei. Generally, they are similar to the "crab-backed beauties" that were widely publicized in Shanghai some time ago. They are named according to their shape and color. The most unusual is the "Red Flag Broadsword Balcony", with claws about six times the length of the body, rarely seen in the market. There are large dog snails and Chang Xin snails. The shellfish is called brocade chicken heart. The third room displays copper crown, eight generations, horseshoe, parrot, and other shells, as well as stone fungus and sea pine. A long table is set up in the middle, displaying specimens of baleen whale, red octopus, sea dragon, seal and various specimens. Huge and unparalleled, with sparkling eyes, lifelike. The fourth room displays marine survey instruments and meteorological measurement instruments. There is also a six-foot square wooden plate with a model of the coastal terrain of Jiangsu made of sand and mud. The fifth room displays nets and fishing gear. There are various types of nets, including Zhang net, pair net, purse seine, tied net, as well as hand-cranked net, air-blown net, Yangcao net, and boat-towing net. There are various types of hooks, including lure hooks, luminous hooks, balance hooks, and standing line hooks. All kinds of shapes are unseen before. There are also various models of fishing boats, some modeled after the latest Japanese styles, and some are the old ones used in our country. They are six or seven feet long or three or four feet long, all with sails raised high and complete machinery, no different from real ships. The sixth room has several colored maps of the sea currents of Jiangsu Province, with detailed annotations. On the table are hundreds of books on fisheries research for anyone to read. There are several other rooms, but they were closed early when the visiting time arrived, so I couldn't visit them all. There is also a gift distribution area, with two large barrels of sea fish. You can get a lottery ticket. Some people who touched fresh yellow croaker smiled. A young woman touched a small yellow croaker and asked to exchange it. There were many jokes. I happened to touch a dried fish and gave it away because it was inconvenient to carry. She left happily.</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Record of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese's "Collecting Gold" <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Nuoxia</p>
<p>The term "collecting gold" originally meant holding something of golden color, which is supposed to be a happy event. However, people from Guangdong use it as a euphemism for collecting and storing the bones of their ancestors, turning joy into sorrow. Is there an intention to moderate the emotions? This must be recorded.</p>
<p>When overseas Chinese from Guangdong die in this area, their bodies are mostly buried in the Guangzhao Mountain Villa, west of Gonghe Road in Zhabei. Every five years, there is a "collecting gold" ceremony. The coffin is opened, and the bones are taken out and wiped clean of accumulated dirt with wine. Then, they are neatly arranged and placed in a coffin lid, fumigated with incense sticks, and exposed to sunlight. After drying, they are stored in urns, with ash used to secure the edges. They are either transported back to their hometown or reburied in the soil. This event is usually held during the Qingming and Chongyang festivals, but especially on the day after the Cold Food Festival. Therefore, when you visit the villa at that time, you will see bones along the path, a shocking sight, like a skull exhibition. It is like a dream, making one wonder, "Where are they now?"</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Foreign Monk at Lingyin Temple <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend Mr. Shen Fengshi came to visit from Hangzhou. We have been friends for ten years, and it was a great joy to meet again after a long separation. That evening, we got drunk at the Huzhou Food Company on Tianjin Road. Mr. Shen told me that there is a foreign monk in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou who has truly opened a new era for monks. Here is what Mr. Shen said:</p>
<p>A reporter from the American Damei Newspaper, Mr. Qiang He, is thirty-three years old and quite famous in the journalism field. In addition to covering news, he attends the Huaguang Night School for Overseas Chinese to study Chinese. He can recite poems and speaks with a Northern accent. He also has studied Buddhist scriptures and can recite them aloud. He knows that the boundless Buddhist Dharma is the foundation for establishing oneself in the world. He often told his wife, Mary, that he would go abroad to China to enter a temple and practice vegetarianism and worship Buddha for the rest of his life. His wife repeatedly tried to dissuade him. However, Mr. Qiang He went to China alone last March. He visited the abbot of Lingyin Temple in Fangzhou and asked to become a Buddhist disciple. His sincerity moved the abbot, who could not refuse and kept him in the temple. Mr. Qiang He chants scriptures day and night, which sounds pleasant. His achievements are quite impressive. Therefore, visitors to Hangzhou now see a foreign monk in Lingyin Temple, who is Mr. Qiang He.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Don't Confuse West Lake with Fuzhou <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Everyone knows West Lake in Hangzhou. However, few people know about West Lake in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. I am writing this specifically to inform those who like to travel. The lake is located west of Fuzhou City. It was created by Prefect Yan Gao in the third year of the Taikang era of the Jin Dynasty, covering a circumference of more than ten li, for the purpose of irrigating farmland. During the time of Wang Shenzhi, it grew to more than forty li. Later, it gradually became silted up. The lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides, with two islands floating in the middle: Xiaogushan and Xieping Island. They are connected to the mainland by the Feihong Bridge and Buyun Bridge. Entering the lake first passes through Xieping Island. There is the West Lake Thatched Cottage, Baozhong Temple, Chenglan Pavilion, Yanxi Hall, and Yanjing Building. Xiaogushan is located in the northeast, connected by the Feihong Bridge. There is the Wanzaitang, Jinghu Pavilion, Huxin Pavilion, and Jianjia Pavilion on the mountain. There is also the Kaihua Temple, so it is also called Kaihua Island. There are many mountains around the lake, such as Guian Mountain, Elephant Buddha Mountain, Guo Mountain, Bailong Mountain, Meiting Mountain, Wenhua Mountain, Luping Mountain, Dajia Mountain, Lingguang Mountain, Dameng Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Qingquan Mountain, Hong Mountain, Huang Mountain, Mo Mountain, Xichan Mountain, Tongpan Mountain, Wufeng Mountain, Dapeng Mountain, Huofeng Mountain, Ma'an Mountain, Yuewang Mountain, Longyao Mountain, Taiping Mountain, Meiliu Mountain, and Wolong Mountain. They cannot all be listed. Famous scenic spots and historical sites include Sanshan Academy, Xie's Thatched Cottage, Guian Well, Yunwo Pond, Dizang Temple, Shanghuwei Bridge, Xiahuwei Bridge, Baofu Temple, Yuquan Temple, Rancuo Gorge Deer Milk Spring, Yiai Pavilion, the former residence of Zheng Yu of the Song Dynasty, the hermitage of Yu Bo'an of the Ming Dynasty, Linshui Villa, Tongxi, the tomb and ancestral hall of Li Zhongding Gong, Lingguang Temple, Jianchi, Yiran Pavilion, West Lake Villa, Zhenwu Palace, Yuxu Hall, Zhu Zi Temple, Pilu Pavilion, Sanyi Temple, Yuancui Pavilion, Lotus Pavilion, Ink Pond, Yanglong Pond, Yujing Pond, Xiangyan Temple, the Great Hui Pagoda Pavilion, Yufeng Pavilion, Cuiwei Hermitage, Hongshan Temple, Sijie Pavilion, Xiyin Temple, Yishan Hall, Taishan Xing Temple, Liu Bridge, Shishan Realm, Lengjia Temple, Huanzhu Nunnery, Beichan Nunnery, Conglu Garden, Qin Pavilion, Xianjing Waterfall, Xuansha Temple Puwen Courtyard, Zhuoxiu Pavilion, etc. There are countless others. As for the scenery, it is said that there are sixteen scenic spots in West Lake: Fairy Bridge Willow Color, Dameng Pine Sound, Ancient Wall Slanting Sun, Crystal First Moon, Lotus Pavilion Evening Singing, Xichan Dawn Bell, Huxin Spring Rain, Chenglan Dawn Oriole, Lake Sky Dragon Boat Racing, Dragon Tongue Tasting Spring, Shengshan Ancient Temple, Feilai Strange Peak, Yishan Eating Lychees, Yanglou Watching the Sea, Lake Pavilion Cultivating Tranquility, and Hongqiao Night Mooring. One can imagine its magnificence. Before entering the lake, you must pass through the Li Zhongding Gong Ancestral Hall, which is dedicated to Li Gang, the Prime Minister of the Song Dynasty. The couplet of the ancestral hall says: "His advance and retreat concerned the country and the people, his heroic spirit forever guards the lakes and mountains." There is also a poem: "The grass and trees around the Prime Minister's Ancestral Hall are barren, his heroic soul forever resents Wang Huang. His life's righteousness was exhausted by hardships, his remains were barely spared after nine deaths. Alas, since the Northerners brought the invading bandits, they have eternally taught the Southerners to feel the vicissitudes of life. Yue Wang died thin, Han Wang was old, the historical records still share the hatred." Behind the ancestral hall is the Lotus Pavilion. The pavilion faces the lake on three sides, and the mountain scenery and water vapor flood the windowsills. In summer, red lotuses bloom, and the fragrance floats on the desk. The acres of blue often reveal delicate red, like fairies in crimson clothes dancing on a green carpet, which is most spectacular. Entering Xieping Island, there is a tall building standing dangerously by the lake, which is the Chenglan Pavilion. Dozens of willows surround it. Every time the grass grows in March, the orioles sing in unison, gentle and melodious, also intoxicating. Passing the Hong Bridge, you arrive at Wanzai Hall. The hall is dedicated to the predecessors of the township who were skilled in poetry. The couplets say: "A few families with mulberry trees on the lakeside, ten miles of hibiscus by the water's edge." "Viewing the water and viewing the mountains are all wonderful realms, the wind and the moon shine through the bright Xuan." "The clouds lie cold on the clothes, the mountain air is beautiful day and night." "Half the city is bright in the evening glow, looking at the staggered battlements, recognizing the home in the countryside, a lake of autumn moon is blue, watching the misty waves, as if one is in Yingzhou." During festivals, poets often gather here. This is the general overview of the lake.</p>

<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Tao Zhugong said that planting a thousand willow trees can provide enough firewood and charcoal. Li Shizhen said that willow trees can be planted horizontally, vertically, upside down, and in any direction, and they will all grow. Because they are easy to plant and grow quickly, and the branches, leaves, roots, bark, flowers, stamens, and cotton seeds can all be used as medicine, their uses are very extensive. Planting trees during Qingming is most appropriate. Planting willows at the door is probably the same as breaking willows at Yangguan, used as a farewell. It is a reminder that as a guest in a foreign land, how can one make a ten-year plan for planting trees? Planting willows is one of them. The fire taken from elm and willow in spring is precisely because the branches are lush and inexhaustible. Willow charcoal is used as a follow-up agent for yin water. Its power to decolorize and eliminate odors is stronger than bone charcoal. Its ash contains a lot of potassium carbonate, which can be extracted by soaking in water to wash away oil stains and replace soap. Willow branches can also be sharpened into toothbrushes, which are great for picking teeth. Because they are soft, they do not harm the teeth. They also contain salicylic acid, which can treat gum swelling, so they are often used. There are different types of willows. Bulrush willow is also known as water willow. The branches are strong and can be used for arrow shafts. Osier grows by the water, with coarse white leaves. The wood grain is slightly red and can be used for carriage axles. It is not easy to break. Its branches can be used to make boxes and baskets. The West Xixi area of Hangzhou has extremely lush wild growth. The bamboo hats sold in Hushu are made of osier. Mencius referred to it as "bending osier into cups".</p>
<p>I planted willows by the water on Meixue Road. They provided shade even after three years. After seven years, they were taller than the building. Every year around the Qingming festival, the tender sun warms the flowers, and the stamens break into fluff. Forced by the east wind, they gather in the southwest corner of the wall, rolling into balls. They are taken to fill pillows, which are fragrant, soft, and lovely. They are not like kapok, which generates heat and is repulsive. The Ben Cao Fa Ming states that willow catkins can be used to make felt and replace wool for mattresses. They are soft and cool, and suitable for children to sleep on. The Wai Tai Mi Yao states that for gold sores that bleed, sealing them with willow catkins will stop the bleeding. The Jing Yan Fang states that for vomiting blood and coughing up blood, bake and grind willow catkins and take one qian with rice soup. The Pu Ji Fang states that for pus sores on the face, mix willow catkins and powder in equal parts and apply with lamp oil. The Ji Jian Fang states that for those suffering from gonorrhea, boil Qingming willow leaves to make tea until cured. The Zhou Hou Fang states that for malignant sores that cannot be named, wash them frequently with willow leaves or bark, unboiled juice, and a little salt. In addition, there are too many methods to list. It is sufficient to know that the use of willow is very extensive. Breaking willows and planting them outside the door during Qingming is precisely to encourage people to take them away and plant them everywhere.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the sixth day, an Indian monk led a tour of the Balawana Temple and the Nigan Temple Parowanath &amp; Jaima Swetambar Dadaii. The temple is not very large, but it is fresh and beautiful and made entirely of marble. It is attached with a garden and fish pond. Visitors must take off their shoes. There are very few monks inside, but the freshness of the temple proves that it has a great influence in society. The Nigan religion is neither Buddhism nor Hinduism. It is a separate religion, namely the Victory School of Patriarch Qi Nana. Sheng means the highest meaning or is called Ni Jian Zi (same as Qian), which is a different transliteration. Ni Jian Zi was contemporary with the Buddha. There is the Sutra of Buddha Saying Ni Jian Zi's Prophecy. This is a major Mahayana sect that the Buddha allowed at that time. However, according to its source, this ancient sect existed before the Buddha was born. It is very strict in asceticism and prohibits killing. It is said that there are still people raising rats in some places, emphasizing the importance of life as the basis of human life, so they worship motherhood and worship the female reproductive organs as the source of life. This is its special point. There are also many sects. There are many small statues in the temple, but it was too late to see them. According to the Sutra of Ni Jian Zi's Prophecy, it completely understands worldly laws, roughly like the Zhou Li of Confucianism. Those who were brought back to Buddhism by the Buddha are now said by Indians that Ni Jian is also a sect of Buddhism. Its content is not known to those who do not understand Indian writing.</p>
<p>Here, there is something to know. Each country has its own situation. If you travel to India or Rome and deny God, it is like denying God in the United States or denying Marx in Russia. Everything in India cannot be separated from God. Even the polytheism of ancient Greece was influenced by India. From Pythagoras to Plato, they all believed in reincarnation. Pythagoras believed that his previous life was a peacock. According to recent research, Greece was influenced by Buddhism. Not only Greece, but also the polytheism of ancient Judaism, Solomon's thousands of concubines all believed in the Indian polytheistic religion. Even Islam still does not leave polytheism.</p>
<p>Bami told me that there are many mother goddesses in India, and Kali is the greatest. She is the common great mother who protects all living beings. Since the beginning of time, Kali has fought and won against the demon king Asuras, so the people and their descendants have been able to live in peace to this day. There is also the goddess of wisdom, Swarawatio, the goddess of wealth, Laksmi, and Durga, and many others. I think this is similar to Greek mythology, like the female immortals in the Chu Ci of China. However, it is only the material for writing and has nothing to do with superstition. Xin Han Jun also said that the most common Hindu male god is Krishna and the goddess is Durga, because Durga also fought against demons to protect all living beings. The final victory is always with the goddess, which is the same as Kali. The worship of Kali is only in the province of Bengal.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Financial Gold Prices Plummet Sharply <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The situation is very depressed. Yesterday, April 9th, the standard gold continued to weaken, and the decline was very strong. The waves were turbulent. There were twists and turns of ten taels in both the front and back markets. The situation suddenly turned weak, the changes were rapid, and unpredictable. In the end, it fell miserably, almost reaching twenty taels. In general, large holders are inclined to sell, and the foreign exchange is loose. The listing price has not changed. The overseas silver market has a slight deviation. As a result, people's hearts are weak, and the gold price fell by ten taels in the morning. Each firm is too eager to buy. Afterwards, it advanced and retreated, hovering around seven hundred and thirty taels. At noon, the foreign exchange was even looser, so the market situation became more tired, and suddenly fell to within twenty-three taels. Suddenly, there was news from abroad that India had a theory of maintaining exchange rates, and it eased slightly. In the afternoon, speculators actively sold out, especially the foreign exchange was even more depressed. The bank was unwilling to accept it unless it was cheap. There was also news that the Japanese Prime Minister had resigned, so it fell another ten taels, with a tendency to go downhill. It has already broken into the seven hundred and twenty tael barrier. And this morning, large bars should rise, etc.</p>
<p>A fall of ten taels in the morning. Since the opening of the May market in the early morning, it has dropped by two taels and one cent to seven hundred and thirty-three taels and five cents. Although the recent large bar has fallen by one-sixteenth, the silver price has risen by one-sixth. Private telegrams have also increased by one-quarter, so the psychology of the industry is downward. Then it was thirty-four taels, and it immediately fell again. Yongfeng, Hengxing, Tong Taichang, etc. have all sold out and broke thirty taels. At 9:20 am, it was only twenty-five and a half taels. The British gold was also hard, initially at 131875. There were transactions in the bank's cashier, and then it could be concluded at 25. When the foreman revealed that it had not changed, it was twenty-eight taels and two or three cents. It was the bank doing forward business with each other at 131875, and then it went down by four or five cents. Retail investors and others bought in, so it increased by more than two taels, and at 9:45 it was thirty taels. Later, Magali and Zhengjin sold 1875 British gold in June, and it was sold by hedging, so it suppressed it by more than three taels. After 10 o'clock, it was twenty-six taels and five cents. Suddenly, Yongheng and Huiyuan came to buy with material hedging, and the British gold was bullish, and it was not easy to get at 1875, causing the gold price to pull up five or six taels. Around 11 o'clock, it was thirty-two and a half taels, but the sellers did not stop. It was heard that a speculator and Yiyu, Hongxingyong, Fuxingyong, Yu Da, etc. sold, a drain of more than ten taels. At 11:45, it was only twenty-two and a half taels. Then the bank absorbed 1325, and the British gold also heard the news that India was maintaining exchange rates, so it has picked up four taels, totaling twenty-six and a half taels. The noon collection was twenty-six taels, and the items made a small two cents. The disclosed price was still 803 taels and four cents, which is seventy-six or seven taels. The afternoon fell another ten taels. The afternoon market opened at twenty-five taels and five cents. Later, due to the rise of Indian remittance by four annas, and there were many sellers, it has dropped to twenty taels and five cents. Then the bank absorbed British gold from 25 to 3125, and it became twenty-four taels. After a while, there were two taels of hovering. After 2:30, the selling atmosphere became more intense. There was news that the Japanese cabinet resigned, and the market was even more empty. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Bingxing, Daxingyong, Fuyu, Zhifengyong, etc. tended to sell, and it fell to eighteen taels and six cents when it was almost three o'clock. Yuanheng and others came back to buy, and Hengxing also bought, and suddenly returned to three taels. At 3:45, it was twenty-one taels and five cents. Later, Wu bravely sold out. It is estimated that Qianchangxiang, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, etc. have all sold out. The British gold was 375 from Shanghai, and Fuchang and others wanted to sell to the bank for 134375, but it was difficult to sell, and the market was weak. After 4 o'clock, it broke the twenty tael barrier again. Finally, it was 16 taels. By 4:30, the market closed at 16 and a half taels, a sharp drop of 19 taels and one cent compared to the previous day, and then it was raised by one tael. The largest price in the city was 34 taels, and the smallest price was 16 taels, with a difference of 18 taels. The early market for items was 35 taels, the noon collection was 25 taels and 8 cents, 5 taels in the afternoon, and the closing price was 17 and a half taels. The disclosed price was 87 taels. The morning account was 26 taels, the afternoon was 17 taels, the water replenishment in the morning was 22 taels, and the afternoon was 13 taels.</p>
<p>Many bulls are coming out. Most of the transactions of each firm are sellers. Yongfeng, Hengxing, Cuichangyong, Fuxingyong and other bulls have sold out. Hengxingyuan, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Futaiheng, Yu Da and others have also sold out. Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Wanxing, and Yongheng all entered. Dadecheng, Yuantai, Zhenchangxiang, and Tong Taichang sometimes made deposits and withdrawals. In the afternoon, Yiyu, Yuanmaoyong, Xinheng, etc. all entered. Shunli and Wanxing made more withdrawals than deposits. Hengxing, Yuantai, and Dadecheng made frequent deposits and withdrawals. Qianchangxiang entered first and then withdrew. Daxingyong, Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Hengxingyuan, and Wu and others sold a large number (mostly selling bulls). Yuanheng and Fuchang went out and then entered. The Guangdong gang made a total of more than 1,000 bars in the front market, and several hundred bars were deposited and withdrawn in the back market. The Dalian gang made a total of 1,700 or 800 bars, and deposited a total of 2,000 or so.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British silver fell slightly, and the American silver was tired. The market was flat, and the United States proposed to rescue the silver market. The Shanghai market seemed to be weakening. The HSBC listing price for each exchange rate had no increase or decrease. Only Hong Kong added 25, totaling 79 taels and 25. However, the purchase price for the four-month period was 125 for British gold and 125 for American gold. The French was 5 yuan. As for the transaction price, it was still flat in the morning, and then it was loose, and then it was peaceful.

<p>Yarn and Cotton - Yarn Market Weakens</p>

<p>Food - Rice Market Declines</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, only about 20 boats arrived from various merchants.

Early indica rice was slow and traded little, and market sentiment was unusually weak, falling by 0.15 jiao. Yangxian indica rice arrivals were scarce and sales were flat, only slightly softer. Duzibu indica rice and others were all quoted lower by nearly 1 jiao, and the situation was unfavorable. White yuan rice arrivals and sales were both slow, and the overall fluctuation was minimal. Special Bianyuan rice opened at around 12.20 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, there were still few sources from the mainland, and the market was extremely quiet. Chang, Xi, Su, Tong, and other machine-milled white japonica rice were mostly traded little, and prices all returned to a small decline of 0.1 to 0.15 jiao. The market showed signs of softening. Few people inquired about early Southern indica rice, and Yongwei and others on this street were all watching, causing the market to also fall by more than 0.1 jiao. Yang, Du, and Jian rice markets were also soft. Bianyinyuan rice still had a few hesitant buyers, so prices were therefore higher but less active.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the noodle market opened in the morning, it was appropriate for the gold price to be reported as small, and the selling price in the northern province also fell, and the market in each month showed a weakening trend. Following the increase in the price of foreign wheat, the factory also recovered the near-empty, and the market began to improve, but the distant factory slightly sold it. As a result, the market remains weak, and the closing price in April is a small 25, May and June are a small 5 li, July is unchanged, and August and September are each a small 5 li.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, each month remained in a firm position, because the price of foreign wheat rose and the order was more difficult to approach, and the goods previously scheduled by the traveling factory did not arrive in Shen on time, so the short positions were covered in succession, and the market prices all rose. The closing prices of April, May, June, and July rose by 3 cents each, and August and September rose by 2 cents each.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Continued Order of Foreign Rice Has Been Confirmed <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the passenger rice market was still being inquired by the street and Guangzhou merchants, and the market was still in a lively position. However, this time, all the passenger routes were tested by the market price decline. If the market rises, it will be difficult to transport. Therefore, although there are sales in recent days, the prices are still fair. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were handled by Guangzhou merchants and the street, with prices ranging from 11.68 yuan to 11.27 yuan. 50 bags of Jiangxi secondary machine-milled Yuan rice were handled by Xiamen merchants, priced at 12 yuan, and there were no other transactions.

<p>Sugar Market - Clearing the Board, Each Sugar Trading Quiet, Market Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegraph, the price of Cuban spot sugar continued to rise by 0.9375 from the previous telegram, and the price of New York sugar in May rebounded by 0.01, and there was no fluctuation in the remaining months. The prices of Java spot and futures sugars also did not rise or fall. Association Market: The market atmosphere was greatly frustrated by the frequent decline in the standard gold, and the asking price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sand was 10 taels, 0.05 qian to 0.045 qian, and No. 20 medium white sand was 9 taels and 0.09 qian. The market has turned flat and weak. Daily sugar transactions are also rare. The upper-grade goods are slightly stable. J mark is 10 taels and 0.07 qian, YP mark is 10 taels and 0.06 qian. TThe TX mark is 10 taels and 0.05 qian, N mark is 10 taels and 0.035 qian, YT mark is 10 taels and 0.025 qian, YPO mark is 9 taels and 0.0825 qian, Minghua goods are 9 taels and 0.08 qian, and SH mark is 9 taels and 0.095 qian. The market is not surprising, and the number plate transactions are still quiet. More than a thousand bags of domestic Huanggang Qing were opened yesterday, and the price was 7 taels. The goods were very inferior, and the demand in the north was still strong, and the number was gradually raised, so the market image was very beautiful. Silk Tea - The Silk Base Must be More Than 900 Taels</p>
<p>The dried cocoon market in this port is increasingly strong, the stock is thin, and it will take two months before the new cocoon is available on the market.

Yesterday, Chunmei and others entered 304 dan of medium-sized spring dried cocoons, and the price was 148 taels. For every 600 catties, the raw silk base must be pulled more than 900 taels.</p>
<p>Yellow and White Factory Distributors Clear Inventory at Firm Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port became increasingly clear and firm. After the US bank and others automatically handled the Shanghai white factory distribution, the French bank continued to throw purchases, and the Chinese silk merchants were difficult to sell at a loss due to the high silk price. Yesterday, only Lianna and others entered 20 packages of Shanghai white factory, and Fu and others entered 20 packages of yellow factory, and Samsung entered 12 packages of yellow coarse silk, and the prices were firm.</p>
<p>North-South Goods - Daylily Prices Are Already Low</p>
<p>The price of daylily has been falling due to the poor sales of each bank. Now it has reached a low price, and the trend is slightly stable. Although the Guangdong and Hong Kong banks have handled the transaction in recent days, the number of acquisitions is still not strong, and the rest of the banks are only transacting sporadically.

<h3 id="e197">Morning <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Xiang</p>
<p>Everything was covered in darkness. The stars were still twinkling with smiles when the alarm clock woke us two from our dreams. Remembering that the English exam, for which we hadn't prepared enough, was today, we disregarded our weariness, which made it hard to even open our eyes, and quickly got out of bed.</p>
<p>Experience told us, "At this time, the person in charge of the water faucets definitely hasn't woken up yet." We had no choice but to hastily wash with the remaining lukewarm water in the overnight thermos. Tiptoeing, we quietly walked down the stairs. Seeing that the dormitory door was still securely locked, we climbed out the window to the classroom and turned on the lights to study English.</p>
<p>The short hand on the wall clock had gradually moved to the middle of six and seven o'clock. The sky had changed from the color of a fish's belly to bright daylight. After we had read through the English once, we felt hungry. We decided to go outside the school to buy something to fill our stomachs.</p>
<p>Walking to the school gate, we saw that it wasn't open yet. The old gatekeeper was still having sweet dreams in bed. We leaned against the gate and knocked loudly, as if someone were knocking outside the school. After a while, we heard the sound of spitting phlegm, dragging slippers, and mumbling complaints from the next room. The old gatekeeper came out wearing his clothes. We quickly hid in a dark corner, watching as the old man asked who it was, while unlocking the gate. He walked out of the school gate and saw that there was no one there. He said to himself, "There's no one here. Could it be that my own ears are playing tricks on me, disturbing people's sleep? But now..." He turned back to look at the clock in the room, "But now it's almost seven o'clock, and the school gate should be open." He opened the gate wider and walked back inside. Lan and I suppressed our laughter, quietly watching him. At this point, we quickly jumped out of the school gate. Outside the school, we couldn't hold back our laughter anymore.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the spring weariness that, although it was already past six o'clock, there was no one on the road except for the coolies who got up early for a living. The doors of the shops on both sides were still tightly closed. We wandered for a long time. As we turned the corner at the intersection of Dalian Road, we suddenly saw wisps of white smoke coming out of a chimney next to the road. We rushed over. It was a small noodle shop. An old woman was cooking noodles in the steam. There were a few tables in the middle. Three people, looking like coolies, were eating heartily.</p>
<p>"What?" I couldn't help but hesitate. I turned my head to ask Lan.</p>
<p>"Let's go. I'm very hungry. Let's not have class prejudices."</p>
<p>We resolutely walked in and chose a table by the wall to sit down. The old woman hurried over and said earnestly, "The shop is small and narrow. To think that young ladies like you would come here. Are you here for noodles?"</p>
<p>"Yes, two bowls."</p>
<p>She hurriedly went to cook the noodles and carefully washed the bowls and chopsticks several times.</p>
<p>"If a reporter from a small newspaper came here, there would be another news item in tomorrow's newspaper—'Female students eat noodles in a small noodle shop'," I said to Lan while eating.</p>
<p>After finishing the noodles, we went to pay the bill. It was only twenty copper coins. We paid a dime and walked out. The old woman quickly called out, "There's more."</p>
<p>"It's alright."</p>
<p>The old woman sent our backs disappearing into the morning light with a look of surprise and joy, still saying thank you.</p>
<p>"If we ate a meal at a famous restaurant, even if we gave them several dimes, they wouldn't be satisfied. But now, it's just a few copper coins, and the old woman is already very happy."</p>
<p>"This is because desires increase with the environment," Lan said.</p>
<p>Walking into the school, the old gatekeeper was sitting and smoking. Seeing me coming in, he asked, "Did you young ladies stay outside the school last night? You came so early today."</p>
<p>We had no choice but to suppress our laughter and mumbled a response.</p>

<p>— Lan Zhu</p>
<p>Hong, please imagine how excited and earnestly I read your letter. My trembling heart and soul, amidst the mingling of blood and tears, were like a broken string fluttering in a gale.</p>
<p>The tone of my life is still played as it was in the past, but my wandering state of mind changes constantly. I am constantly floating and sinking in a whirlpool of suffering. Hong, you say my emotions are fragile and too capricious. That is indeed a piercing remark. I don’t know why, but even a slightly unsatisfactory event will make me secretly shed tears behind others’ backs. I remember one morning, receiving a registered letter from you, saying you were sick in a foreign land. I hadn't even finished reading it when I felt a sharp pain in my heart, and tears welled up. Finally, I lay on my pillow and cried to my heart's content, until class was over. Hui came into the dormitory, and I reluctantly held back my tears, pretending to be sick to parry their probing inquiries. Hong, it seemed like they knew all along, and a cold sneer appeared on each of their faces. Hong, I wished there was a hole I could drill into and escape. I couldn't bear their kind of humiliation. I was truly embarrassed then. Hong, I don't know how many times I have experienced such small tragedies. When will I ever be free?</p>
<p>Sometimes, thinking of life’s journey, it feels as though twilight is rapidly approaching. My feet are wounded by thorns, and I can no longer move forward. It is as if there are ferocious beasts closing in. Hong, you flew in from beyond the sky, rescuing this weakling who was approaching death. I am gaining new life under your care.</p>
<p>Beloved Hong, I am so grateful for your earnest guidance. First, clear away the atmosphere of sorrow, overcome the floating-duckweed-like consciousness; second, devote all your energy to studying. Hong, this is indeed the path that young people should take at this stage. In recent years, the surge of revolutionary tides has swept many young people out of schools, causing them to sink deeply into the whirlpool of the times. Now, they feel emptiness from reality. Every young person is spreading in this morbid state. Where to go? This question is now widely circulating among young people. Indeed, modern young people are still wandering on the wrong path in life. In particular, the matter of dropping out of school causes them to wander, and because of wandering, they have no way to solve the problem of living, eventually leading to suicide. We can see these tragic facts everywhere.</p>
<p>In this poor and lacking China, it is certainly not easy to find a way to live. However, the youth themselves lack the skills to make a living, which is also a major reason. If they had true scientific knowledge, it would be very needed in this China that is being built. Hong, I feel this way now.</p>
<p>Hong, your love of literature is certainly your personality, but your environment also forces you to step onto the literary field. I still remember in a long letter you gave me last winter, you said, "Zhu, wandering on the impoverished road of life, literature is my only comfort." Hong, this is precisely the phenomenon that young people who feel spiritual distress must have. You are just one of them. Recently, many young people have neglected proper science and are intoxicated in the garden of literature, especially young people who have fallen behind on the journey of life. They use literature to sing of their hearts full of sorrow. Alas, this uninspiring scene is a terrible temptation for young people to fall into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>Hong, your year of wandering the world's sorrows has been secretly revealed in the letters you gave me. Spending your time so emptily like you, the vague future is even more vague. I hope you start student life again, even though this is a widespread and serious problem of dropping out of school.</p>
<p>Strive hard, break out of the pincer attack. Hong, I am waiting for you.</p>
<p>Go to school.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Peace of Mind <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Zhe</p>
<p>Brother De, it has been a long, long time since we have seen him. De is a very hardworking person, and his school is also a strict school like a church school. We all know this deeply. However, even so, we cannot help but have doubts, because we do not believe that in this period of nearly two months, he has not even come to see us once, nor even had the time to write us a letter. So, we have gone from suspicion to anxiety. The idea of going to see him, I don’t know how many times and how many days it has arisen, but after all, we are all people with duties in our bodies, and because the location of his school is in such a remote West Shanghai, therefore we have no chance to fulfill our wishes. Yesterday, we heard that his school had started spring break. At the same time, my sister, Chun Di, little sister and I decided to go to Ye Family Garden today, so I thought of seeing Brother De first today, and calling him to play with us.</p>
<p>Early this morning, Chun Di got up. While he was washing his hands and face, he urged me like this, saying:</p>
<p>—Jun, you should get up too. It takes two hours to go to Wusong from here. If you are late, I am afraid Brother De will be out again.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Although it is only thirty or forty miles from here to Wusong, it does take two hours to go by train. Here, we cannot but thank our road administration authorities. Hearing Chun Di's words, which seemed to contain a warning, I hurriedly rolled out of bed, hastily washed my hands and face, and started to go to the train station.</p>
<p>Things turned out to be so unfortunate. As I stepped into the station gate, I only heard a "woo" sound. The train to Wusong had slowly pulled out of the platform. Oh, I could only stare at its gradually disappearing back and the black smoke still lingering in the air, quietly waiting for the next train, which was an hour away.</p>
<p>"A day is like a year," I think this sentence is most appropriate to describe my state of mind when I was waiting for the train at the station.</p>
<p>Thank goodness, the train to Wusong that I was eagerly waiting for finally arrived. So I rushed into the carriage as if someone who had fallen into a deep well had suddenly seen someone taking a rope to rescue him. Soon, with a "woo" sound, the train started. It wound its way through many villages and fields, but I did not take in all these beautiful spring suburbs, because at this time, I was only thinking about whether Brother De was doing well at home, and how I would make him welcome my unexpected visit.</p>
<p>—People often return with the opposite of what they hope for. I forgot who it was, but it seemed like someone had said this to me. Now, of course, I returned with the opposite of what I hoped for, because when I arrived at Brother De's school, after inquiring from his roommates, I learned that Brother De had gone on a trip to Fort Baoshan with a group of them and their German professor. So I had to hang my head dejectedly and left this message back:</p>
<p>"Brother De, I came full of excitement, to see you, and fully expected to go to Ye's Family Garden with you, but who knew that on the way back, there would only be a desolate me? Today I can no longer muster the interest to go sightseeing, and I also believe that they—my sister and Chun Di, etc.—will all have the same degree of disappointment as me. But even so, this visit of mine cannot be considered a wasted trip, because from the fact that you can go on a trip to Fort Baoshan, I know that our previous guess that you were sick, or that you had some special accident, has been disproven by the facts, letting us know that we were a little neurotic. In this way, although we cannot meet today, we can all put our unsettled minds at ease. Now I am leaving, I wish you good health and progress.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Random Notes of a Northern Trip <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Anping</p>
<p>V. Xuanwu Lake at Night</p>
<p>The Temple of the City God and the Central Party Headquarters are very close. After dismounting, I went to find Hao. It was already quite dark. Without taking a moment's rest, Hao took us to dinner. Hao said that the best place to go was the Confucius Temple. The Confucius Temple, that place, is truly an old friend of mine. But the fatigue that came from riding a horse made me not want to take another step. I said, "Forget it." So he led us to a Cantonese restaurant. I remember that six or seven years ago, Dingjiaqiao was truly desolate. But now, there were actually several decent restaurants. Speaking of that day's dinner, it was really not very good. But this "not very good" refers to the restaurant, not the host. Not to mention that the host treated me to dinner, even if he treated me to a big pancake, it wouldn't matter at all.</p>
<p>After dinner, I said that I wanted to take a walk on Xuanwu Lake. That was mostly because it was close. What I most remember about the spring of my childhood is this Xuanwu Lake. When I was in Nanjing before, I would go almost ten times every spring. Three or four people, a group, buying two or three catties of cherries, a small boat, in the lake, we would sing, chat, talk. The shadow of Zijin Mountain was reflected in the lake in the distance, clear and bright. The sun sprinkled thousands and thousands of golden threads on the trees, the cherries, the soil, the lake, and the heads of the tourists. Far away, in the groves of trees, a parasol moved faintly, and under the parasol was the hem of a skirt being blown by the breeze. A poem, outside Fengrun Gate, permeated with the atmosphere of spring. Donkeys, rickshaws, bicycles, formed a bustling scene. At that time, at that time, I didn't understand anything. What I understood was playing foolishly, eating foolishly, laughing foolishly.</p>
<p>That night, the moon should have been very good, but because the sky was misty, only a pale, dead-man's-face-like color appeared on the big screen. Everything on the lake seemed to have fallen into slumber, so quiet that there wasn't a sound. From Fengrun Gate, the absolutely straight embankment, about three or four meters long, had dense branches on both sides. Under the dense branches, a secluded road unfolded. Leisurely, quiet, unheeded boats floated on the lake like fallen leaves. Occasionally, a bit of fire appeared on a blurred island, as interesting as a star in the sky.</p>
<p>At first, we walked together, in a row, like four soldiers. Later, I wanted to let myself wander alone for a while, saying, "You go ahead a few steps." So I fell behind thirty or forty yards, walking leisurely as if I had disappeared. Sometimes I was muttering some inexplicable lines of poetry, and sometimes I was singing "Lonesome Road" from "Showboat." The atmosphere was very bleak, but because the trip to Beiping made me unspeakably happy, sadness did not attack my heart at all.</p>
<p>VI. A "whoosh" sound suddenly overturned my peaceful heart.</p>
<p>I had booked a ticket for the express train that departed from Pukou at 7:00 p.m. on the third, so at a little after 2:00 p.m. on the third, I hired a car with my nephew, Xi, to go to Xiaguan. The pain in my muscles and bones that had erupted from over-riding horses made me unable to even lift a small suitcase. That time, I was able to cross the river smoothly and get on the train entirely thanks to Xi's help.</p>
<p>That day, the fog was very heavy. Not to mention that you couldn't see Pukou across the river from the riverside of Xiaguan, even in Changzi, I'm afraid that objects beyond ten yards were completely blurred. We took the 3:30 p.m. ferry across the river. Jiangnan, Jiangnan disappeared in that seemingly reluctant-to-parting mood. White gulls occasionally splashed in the water in the heavy fog, and then I didn't know where they flew, to the edge of the sky or the corner of the earth. On the boat, neither Xi nor I said a word. Thus, we arrived at Pukou.</p>
<p>It was hard to find my own berth. The train was a blue-steel train, which I had never had in the South. A small compartment had four berths in total, two upper berths and two lower berths. At that time, the special express from Shanghai had not yet arrived in Nanjing. The train was deserted and a bit scary. Only some porters transporting mail and luggage on the platform were shouting loudly, giving some life to the entire station.</p>
<p>Xi sat in my room for a while, because he had to return to the city, so I advised him to leave. "Seeing a friend off for a thousand miles, there must be a parting." Anyway, I didn't feel any sadness in my heart at that time. He felt that what I said was right, and it wasn't too early in the day. So, I shook his hand, said a few "Farewells," and sent him off the train. I stood on the platform until his figure disappeared in the blur, and then I returned my gaze, neck, and heels to their original state.</p>
<p>At that time, a locomotive was driving into the station from the north end. A "whoosh" sound, it was so sharp, alas, it was so sharp, like a thunderclap, suddenly overturning my peaceful heart. From Shanghai all the way to stepping on the Jinpu train, my breath was always so calm, and it had never been as unbearable as it was at that time. My soul felt like it had been violently shaken, and it floated up a bit. I looked back at the South River hidden in the fog, and walked back to the train car dejectedly.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Spring Night Stroll <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Jun</p>
<p>I. Rouge and Cherry Lips</p>
<p>Was it not cherry blossom season yet? Probably the whole country in the East was madly celebrating the cherry blossom season. I don't know why, but while Rou and I were walking on the road, I thought of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>My heart has always been saddened by the changes of human affairs, the past like bubbles, and stirred up like the spring breeze ruffling the water in the pond. Although the weather outside was warm, I wanted to run out of the confined room and wander around. Several times I came back seeing people with hateful faces. It's not that I didn't want to be with them, I really was a bit scared of their cleverness, wanting to be a noble and detached person. So I thought like this alone in the room, and that going out would be better to wait until late at night. At night everything is quiet, I can stand on the street watching the dissolving spring night moon, and I can also appreciate the beauty of the moon. The goose-yellow moonlight洒洒 on the city buildings like a large tomb, and heaven and earth return to solemnity and harmony.</p>
<p>Tonight, I swallowed this unprecedented pleasure into my heart with my breath. Ye also accompanied me out of Tangjiawan like a chanting poet. The engines of the machines in the factory were becoming louder. All around was quiet, quiet, only the rising and falling sounds of the machines turning could be heard.</p>
<p>It's so lonely, this spring without flowers, we said lonely. Thinking that the cherry blossoms in Japan are just beautiful now, but we don't have the blessing to see them. Although it is spring here, the street lights are still as dim and yellow as in winter nights, and the feelings they give us on a sensory level don't make us feel spring. On the side of the road, there are still a few sparse young women selling their bodies. Without any brilliance, like a moon about to set but not yet setting, they greeted passers-by with their voices. Next to each young woman was an old woman with ugly temples. We all walked past dejectedly. After passing through many such difficult checkpoints, we were persuaded by one of them at a certain place. Her waist was soft, her eyes were clear, and the color of the rouge on her lips was particularly striking, making people recognize that this was a cherry blossom petal. Ah, cherry blossoms of the East, we indifferently walked away. Cherry blossoms are supposed to be in bloom at night.</p>
<p>II. Night Pounding</p>
<p>Two young people with a slightly decadent air ran from Tangjiawan all the way to the suburbs, discovering a wilderness. There was a small river, dirty and narrow, making people wonder if it was a ditch. Small boats were arranged head to tail in it. We stood on the bank and looked at the half-bright lights in the boats, and could guess that they were not sleeping soundly at this moment, because the moon sometimes flashed into the clouds, and the wilderness immediately seemed to be covered by a net-like fog. The barking of dogs across the wilderness also came to our ears intermittently. The layers of stacked sleepers along the river were also placed there like corpses. This night's scene was a bit desolate and made people shudder. The drooping old branches had not grown their tender buds, nor had they bloomed. We walked leisurely, walked, and Rou and I both felt a little thirsty, wanting to find some water to drink, but the doors of the teahouses were all tightly closed at this time. The water in the river was so dirty. If we could drink it, we would have scooped the water into our hands and drank it long ago. At this time, we really had no choice and didn't speak, just thinking about going to a place to find a source of water. I believe we are in the desert at this moment.</p>
