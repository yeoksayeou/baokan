<p>近數月來。東北中日鐵道協商。正積極準備正式集會。我國人萬目睽睽。方期今後中日兩國能以真誠赤悃。由鐵道之協商。進而謀中日間一切問題之解决。互相提携。共謀兩國之繁榮。雖傳聞藉藉。謂日方朝野有若何對我東北之激烈主張。但吾人絶不敢信處於今日太平洋上風雲緊急牽一髮即足以動摇全局之秋。日政府甘冒天下之大不韙。輕易擾亂太平洋上之和平。尤其五三慘案之血跡未乾。中日間之裂痕猶在。每一次日方對我壓迫之結果。適足使兩國人民加深其隔閡。歷年來我國人對日感情之惡化。皆足供日人之深慮長思。吾人更不信日政府於我國人舊痛未平。舊恨未消之日。重演出若何悲劇。務使兩國關係趨於極端。乃不幸霹靂一聲。復有近日萬寳山案件之發生。吾人對此。實不勝其悲憤惋惜之忱。</p>
<p>閣田中義一。於滿蒙積極政策之奏章中有云。「……至今在東三省之朝鮮民。幾及百萬有奇。如此之現象。爲帝國對滿蒙之權利。不求而可自得。真可謂國家造成莫大幸福。而帝國對滿之國防上經濟上。添加無數勢力。爲鮮民統治上顯出莫大曙光」。又云丶「一面利用巳歸化之鮮民。盛爲收買滿蒙水田地。而另由各地之信用合作或銀行。或東拓會社或滿鐵公司。通融有支那籍之朝鮮民資金。而作我經濟侵入之司令塔也」。又云。「按在滿蒙之朝鮮人。如擴張至二百萬人以上者。待萬寳山案件之發生。起因於韓人之强闢水田。强挖水道。引起我國當地農民之激烈反抗。截至今日。據各方面所得消息。案情日益擴大。形勢日形嚴重。韓地各處暴民。竟至慘殺我僑胞。而日政府更紛紛調兵遣將。增多在我東北之軍備。一若有若何大事即將發生者。日本幣原外相對駐瀋陽日總領事訓電。甚至謂「……是此實難保不再發生昭和二年之不祥事件。（即濟南五三慘案）……倘若中國官憲漠視再三之警告。則日政府由保護滿洲日僑之見地。不得不取正當之處置。結果或釀成極重大之局面。亦未可料」。（六月三日新聯電）據此以觀。則韓人之種種非法行動。皆爲日人有計劃之操縱指使。將來案件擴大。嚴重至若何程度。吾人誠不敢預測。然而日人之違背公理與正義。及圖窮而匕首現之急遽行動之顯示世界。吾人迥憶歐戰前赫赫不可一世之德意意。則不得不爲日人惜。更不得不爲日人懼。</p>
<p>萬寳山案件之發生。自其表面觀之。起因固微。但窺其裏面。則此案實爲日人滿蒙積極策之第一聲。其一貫的政策。與事前有計劃之整備。吾人皆不難於事實中抽繹而出。</p>
<p>方幣原之膺任外交。其所宣示之對華政策。爲穩健。爲恢復華人對日好感。一反從前之暴力高壓政策。雖其一貫的大陸政策之執行無殊於前。但手段之運用。則實略較爲緩和。乃彼國野心家之政客武人。羣斥其軟弱無能。爲有辱大和民族。甚且謂爲賣國外交。舉國呶呶。責難紛至。而上下一口。都以所謂對滿蒙積極政策爲重大主張。而有所謂「應一掃僅顧慮他人顔色之外交的缺陷。對於全世界爲擁護日本之特殊地位。須有積極之主張」之狂妄言論。政府迫於國内反對政黨之攻擊。爲迎合人心。緩和反對。故對我國之侵凌。乃一變爲積極。此萬寳山案件發生之遠因一也。自帝俄革命。國體改革。而實力亦日增。遠勝於前。日蘇兩强在我東北利益之衝突。隨時有重起糾紛之可能。而此次日蘇漁權交涉之惡化。益使兩國同感不安。日人之神經過敏者。甚且謂蘇俄之五年計劃。即無異於對日作戰計劃。將來日蘇重起戰爭。殆爲不可避免。爲防日蘇衝突。不能不有所準備。而對蘇準備。必先與我東北衝突。故不如積極攫取東北。先爲佈置。方針旣定。行動隨之。此萬寳山案件發生之遠因二也。日本國内失業。近益增多。爲救濟國内失業之嚴重問題。乃積極驅逐韓人。流入我東北境内。而移殖其國民入於韓士。按日前内有事之時。則以朝鮮民爲原子。而作軍事活動。更藉取締爲名。而援助其行動」。凡此言論。證之今日事實。若合符節。此萬寳山案發生之遠因三也。明上三因。從可知萬寳山案件之發生。爲所謂「滿蒙積極政策」之發動。其内幕固不如表面事實之簡單也。至於實施滿蒙積極政策之準備。自任宇垣爲朝鮮總督。任内田爲滿鐵總裁。增加朝鮮駐軍改定駐我東北師團爲常駐三事觀之。亦甚明晰。宇垣曾四度爲陸相。曾代理鮮督四年。在清浦内閣時。即力主從速確立大陸政策。對於滿鮮政策之統一。平素亦懷有相當抱負。故日政府特爲起用。其就職後之談話。有謂「在朝鮮代理總督四年。彼時思此後試辨之事良多。顧今日之時代與當時相差甚遠。擬徐加考慮。而努力副所期待」。所謂「今日之時代與當時相差甚遠」。及「副所期待」皆言中有物。足資吾人深思。至其就任後。對於軍政整理案。着着實施。更足證日政府起用字垣督鮮爲對我東北實際行動之準備。此其一。内田總裁在日俄戰爭時代。曾使我國。日本在我東北之權益如何得來。彼實詳知。而對於我國情形。尤爲熟習。同時内田對於滿洲問題之見解。與幣原外交亦爲一致。其對於解决東北懸案之三大原則。爲（一）日本負責維持滿洲之治安。爲防一切不安動摇於未然計。對於必要手段之使用。應隨時在中國官憲諒解之下。請求本國政府之預爲决定。（二）滿鐵之真正使命。係以滿蒙之産業的開發及文化的設施爲重心。日本應依其特殊的關係。確保其在滿洲之經濟上之自由。但此經濟的自由之主張。並非欲阻中國及第三國之經濟的活動。且歡迎第三國之投資交易等經濟的活躍。以謀機會均等。門户開放之實現。（三）關於鐵道政策。要求中國及任何第三國嚴守滿洲善後協定之主旨。中國若依共存共榮之原則。以利益折半主義爲前提。在不背前述善後協定之範圍内。對於旣設幹綫而敷設培養線。可予以承認。然滿鐵應採二大幹線主義。要求中國承認日本實行吉會路敷設權。此三大原則。外以門户開放機會均等之名詞對列强送秋波。以中日兩國共存共榮之名詞對我國肆欺騙。而對彼國在東北之所謂旣得權益。則態度强硬。表示絲毫無讓步之餘地。而其主張以武力爲外交後盾。則尤與其國内狂妄之政客異聲同調。是其爲外交界之斵輪老手。吾人巳可想見。而幣原於此時推荐内田爲滿鐵總裁。其深籌熟慮。吾人亦不難推知。此爲對我東北積極行動之準備二。據東京一日電通社電。軍事參議官會議將三長官會議决定之滿洲常駐師團設置案提出討論。結果將原案承認。即將内地一師團移駐滿洲。作爲永久常駐師團。將現在施行之二年間交替一次之屯駐師團制度廢止。又關於朝鮮軍增加充實問題之討論。金谷參謀長謂現在日本國防作戰。以大陸作戰爲其基幹。故應於一朝有事之際。急調有力部隊於滿蒙方面。以制先機。而使戰局爲有利之展開。宜乘宇垣大將就職鮮督之機會。斷行增加。南陸相亦謂增加朝鮮駐軍。並非以維持治安爲目的。應以用兵作戰爲目的。結果提出（一）移駐内地一師團於朝鮮。（二）派往内地駐兵一旅團。（三）倣滿洲辦法。設置步兵獨立部隊於朝鮮。又據日方消息。日政府鑒及西鮮國防軍實力不充。經閣議通過。增加西鮮預定衛戍地點。京義沿綫。大邱車站。設立旅團司令部各一處。共駐步兵一聯隊。並騎砲工三特科隊。復在大田設立旅團司令部各一。駐步兵一聯隊。全州光州各駐步兵一聯隊。原駐大邱步兵八十聯隊。移駐義州。視此種急忙調兵遣將之動作。及其所謂「國防作戰」「大陸作戰」之言論。爲其作戰之準備巳無疑義。同時證以近日大連巿之日空軍演習。更足證其不僅準備積極用政治手腕侵略我東北。更巳準備積極之軍事行動此其三。日人對我東北之侵略。旣巳具决心。巳有充分之準備。則此次萬寳山案件之發生。决非偶然。實有其必然。此點我國人絶不容忽視。（未完）</p>

<p>（四）收入概數之實際與可能</p>
<p>本年度的預算總數爲四丶八八○丶○○○元丶以數字言丶比較上年度丶固然是少了一六丶五五二元丶（詳見七月六日本報）但實際上則并不如此丶就說他比上年度增加了不少丶也無不可丶比方丶本年度各敎育機關經費丶合計爲四丶四九一丶一五五元丶而上年度則爲四丶一五○丶四七二元丶（詳見七月七日本報）這不是明明增加了三四○丶六八三元嗎丶不過預備費和另行支配的臨時費丶今年没有去年的多罷了丶（今年預備費九五丶三八八元丶另行支配的二九三丶四五七元丶共三八八丶八四五元丶去年預備費三九七丶一九○元丶另行支配的三四八丶八九○元丶共七四六丶○八○元丶相差三五七丶二三五元丶這個相差之數丶正是今年各敎育機關增費一三四○丶六八三元一的來源也丶）但是這兩種數目的多寡丶在事實上於經費本身或無甚深之關係丶因爲收入實數往往不能照着預算所列的丶巳成爲不可避免的現象丶所以預備費和另行支配的數目丶自然而然的具備了充分的彈性丶欵數儘管照副丶實際上遇着收不敷支的時候丶還是把他擺着丶設法動用丶十九年度的預備費和另行支配的共七四六丶○八○元丶以數字論丶不爲不多丶而實際支配的臨時費只有一八○丶○○○元丶僅占四分之一丶且是十九年度終了以後才支配的丶（容後詳述）各校何時可以領到這費丶尚不可知丶這就是富於彈性的明證丶至於經費丶按時發放丶未許短少丶却是硬性的丶非萬不得巳丶不容有所伸縮丶今年度的預算丶把彈性的臨時費减少了三五七丶二三五元丶同時丶就照着减少的程度把硬性的經常費增加了三丶四○丶六八三元丶這是預算的一個進步丶也是敎育行政當局一種負責的表示丶上面說的本年度預算丶實際并不减少丶即是這個道理丶在說明本年度預算的實際性之後丶兹再進而談談他的可能性丶就是這個預算丶在本年度内丶究竟能夠充分的實現不能丶這是很重要的一點丶過去幾個年度的預算實施情形丶都不免患着虚收實支的毛病丶十八年度的時時枯涸丶以致挪用了十九年度的收入五四○丶○○○元丶十九年度的一再遲遲發放丶引起敎育職員會屢次的集議和表示丶這都是虚收實支所産生的結果丶當然丶實支是應該的是毫無問題的丶所成問題者就是收八的「虚」而巳丶如果收入能實丶支出也自然可實丶否則數巳虚丶則支亦隨之而虚丶種種意外糾紛丶也就跟着來了丶那麽丶本年度預算的收入丶到底能不能「實」呢丶要答此問丶先得看看預算所列入的内容丶尤須看看近年所列收入的内容和比較丶現在將近三年度的收入預算丶查列於后丶</p>
<p>項　　　别　　　　十八年度收入預算　　　十九年度收入預算　　　二十年度收入預算</p>
<p>田賦漕附　　　　　二丶二○○丶○○○元　二丶四八○丶○○○元　二丶五○○丶○○○元</p>
<p>屠牙稅　　　　　　一丶二○○丶○○○元　一丶二八○丶○○○元　一丶三○○丶○○○元</p>
<p>學宿費　　　　　　　　一五二丶九八○元　　　一七一丶九八○元　　　一八○丶○○○元</p>
<p>省庫補助　　　　　　　　七五丶○○○元　　　三七五丶○○○元　　　三○○丶○○○元</p>
<p>財政部歸還舊欠　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　二○○丶○○○元　　　六○○丶○○○元</p>
<p>舊欠田賦帶征　　　　　三○○丶○○○元　　　三○○丶○○○元</p>
<p>管理處整理增收　　　　　八九丶五七二元　　　　八九丶五七二元</p>
<p>合　計　　　　　　四丶○一七丶五五二元　四丶八九六丶五五二元　四丶八八○丶○○○元</p>
<p>根據右表丶作個粗綫的算法丶（一）十八年度挪用了十九年的收入五四○丶○○○元丶則該年度的實收丶至多不過三丶五○○丶○○○元丶（二）十九年度丶時間雖巳過去丶而收支均未結束丶照着事實丶每校經費現在只發至五月份之上半月丶在上年度内丶尚欠一個半月（至六月爲止）丶平均每月四○○丶○○○元丶一個半月爲六○○丶○○○元丶那麽巳收數也至多不過四丶三○○丶○○○元丶（其實丶事實上决收不到此數丶）再加上十八年度挪用之五四○丶○○○元丶則上年度之不敷丶截至此時止丶應在百萬以上矣丶百萬的數目丶何等鉅大丶（三）上項虧欠丶如果設有别的方法來彌補丶那麽本年度的收入丶就算完全實在丶也不能不受其牽制和影響丶何况本年度的收入實在與否還是問題呢丶因此丶記者對於本年的預算丶未敢過抱樂觀丶</p>
<p>現在丶且退一步丶單就本年度的預算丶預測本年度的收入狀况丶而將各項收入一一加以申說丶</p>
<h3 id="c83">（一）田賦劃撥欵 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>本年度列二丶五○○丶○○○元丶比去年前兩年度都少丶（前年度爲二丶五○○丶○○○元丨田賦和舊欠帶征丨丶去年度爲二丶七八○丶○○○元○這自然是有鑒於以前所收的虚而不實丶而預爲之所丶查蘇省敎育經費之以田賦指撥丶係由於原充敎費之捲烟稅欵劃歸國有而來丶以前係用「派欵」方法丶總數初定爲一丶八○○○丶○○○元丶隨後逐漸增加丶但各縣派欵丶往往解不足數丶所以改用「劃撥」方法丶（即是漕米正稅每石提出四角丶忙銀正稅每兩提出二角二分丶忙銀省稅每兩提出二角五分丶）中間經過許多的波折丶省府敎廳丶財廳丶敎費委員會和敎費管理處等丶往返商議丶不下數十次丶自十七年三月起丶一直到十九年五月九日丶蘇省府第二九二次會議丶才議决「從十八年漕忙啟征起丶實行劃分丶令財政廳通飭遵照丶舊欠另行設法清還」丶「劃分」辦法丶至此始得見之實行丶近一年多以來丶各縣解數丶漸見起色丶在開始實行的第一年丶報解不免略遜丶今年度可算實行的第二年了丶應該要好些所以這筆收入丶可望其不虚丶或者還可以超出二丶五○○丶○○○元的數目丶上面不是說過去前兩年度的預算數丶都比今年多嗎丶更有一層丶今年三月十四日丶財廳函管理處及經費委員會云丶「查田賦劃撥敎育專欵丶係在敝廳經征丁漕蘆課項下丶按兩按石劃出丶其預算收入標準丶當以近三年秋勘定征兩數石數平均計算丶再照每兩四角七分丶每石一元四角折合丶依此標準丶每年應劃敎育專欵丶約爲三百二十餘萬元丶而十九年度預算僅列二百七十八萬元丶相差四十餘萬丶與整個田賦數目丶不相符合丶現值辦理二十年度預算期間丶特將近三年秋勘實征平均數及應劃敎育專欵丶開列清單丶（見後）附送察閱丶請即依據單開數目丶列爲二十年度預算丶以免再蹈上年不符之轍丶」計開</p>
<p>（甲）地丁三年平均實征二五五○丶六二五兩丶每兩劃撥四角七分丶計一丶一九八丶七九三元丶</p>
<p>（乙）漕米三年平均實征一丶四○○丶一三二石丶每石劃撥一元四角丶計一丶九六○丶一八五元丶</p>
<p>（丙）蘆課三年平均實征一四七丶九二二兩丶</p>
<p>每兩劃撥四角七分丶計六九丶五二三元丶</p>
<p>以上三項丶共應劃撥三丶二二八丶五○一元丶照此看來丶這項收入丶就超出若干丶也屬可能丶不過田賦與收成成正比例丶如果今年收成不大好丶則溢額之收丶或無甚希望丶但於所列數目丶總可以有相當的把握丶</p>
<h3 id="c84">（二）屠牙稅 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>連年所增無幾丶收數頗屬可靠丶今年三月份的牙稅盈獎數達一二丶四七○元餘丶可以想見其盈收狀况了丶</p>
<h3 id="c85">（三）學宿費 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>數屬可靠丶并無問題丶不過各校往往不肯照解丶欲留作他用丶今後加能做到報數抵解的地步丶也就行了丶</p>
<h3 id="c86">（四）省庫補助 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>這項補助丶可算是額外的收入丶其實丶田賦劃撥之二三百萬元丶何嘗不是原屬省庫的欵子丶因爲年來省預算逐漸增大丶而派欵和劃欵丶數有一定丶不能隨便增益丶敎育事業又是繼續發展的丶所以有此特别的補助丶計十七年度領到一半丶十八年度領到三分之一丶十九年度則將陸續領清丶大約本年度内丶也可不致再欠</p>
<h3 id="c87">（五）財部歸還舊欠 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>上年度之二○○丶○○○元丶尚未領到丶今年竟增至六○○丶○○○元丶恐更無望丶聞敎費會討論今年預算時丶大家也認爲毫無把握丶不知將來如何可以使其照數領到耳丶</p>
<p>總之丶本年度預算的實際性和可能性丶都比上年度的爲多丶此後果能時局安定丶五　豐登丶則虚收實支的程度丶可以希望好些丶是亦蘇省敎育前途之新曙光歟丶（待續）</p>

<p>犯罪亦有潮流。如架人勒贖。謂之綁票。前此江南各地。罕有發生。自孫美瑶臨城斷路。綁架外人。藉此要挾得官後。綁票之風遂盛。由北而南漸。熾於滬瀆。此犯罪之潮流一也。又如盜墓。自東陵被發。囊括得多種奇珍。北平宵小。遂亦尤而效之。寢成風氣。北平原多貴族佳城。皆陸續被盜。甚至伶人譚鑫培之墓。亦不能倖免。可見其熾。今此風且駸駸乎有南漸之勢。將與綁票潮流。同其普遍矣。吳縣有宋賢朱長文者。其墓竟亦被掘。並遭分裂遺骸之慘。令人酸鼻。事關毁壞名賢遺跡。道德人心。胥有影響。較之盜掘普通人墳墓。又有不同。蓋朱氏仕宋爲秘書省正字。博聞强識。學術湛深。性恬淡。不樂進取。築樂圃於城内。讀書其中。即今舊樂圃書院。吳城名蹟之一也。晚起本州敎授。尋遷太學博士。敎人先經術。後詞章。生平著述。有傳有不傳。其書目盡載宋史。清乾隆初。曾撥帑修葺樂圃。巳而江蘇學政李因培。奏請宏獎名賢。亦以朱名列首。其受後世崇仰。有如此者。不意當此青白旗下。其墓竟以被盜聞丶曷勝憤慨。甚願有司緝獲首犯。嚴重懲處。以遏此犯罪之惡潮流使不至如綁票之隨地蔓延也。</p>

<p>不是甘地的無抵抗主義</p>
<p>監獄兩字在我們聽來。是多麽可怕的一個名字。大家避之猶恐不及那裏會得踴躍。不料在這無奇没有的世界上。地球另一方面的人民。因爲天時地理的關係。竟在那裏當它作天堂用呢。</p>
<p>原來最近美國華盛頓州接得一個消息。知道阿拉斯加州（在北美的西北角）希望角地方擬招標建一規模較前更大的監獄一所。這原也是一件普通的事。但是這事的動機未免太滑稽了。說是該地愛斯開馬人非但不以入獄爲恥。並且因爲地處寒帶。生活艱苦的緣故。都有意破法犯罪。冀得一嘗鐵窗風味。</p>
<p>該事的發生。乃因在不久之前。美國駐軍拘捕了兩個觸犯法律的土人。這本不是希罕的事。那裏知道却因此肇下了　。原來他倆在牢裏吃得好。住得暖。較之在冰天雪地中討生活。好過十倍。於是他們在出獄之後。把這個一向無人發現的安樂窩講給同伴們聽。結果他們全部有意犯罪。以便一嘗鐵窗風味。監獄也就此宣告客滿了</p>

<p>臭蟲一物。滋蔓最易。壽命亦長。上海户口櫛比。臭蟲尤多。雖有藥水藥粉。然因價昻亦不易普及。余友顧子馨。蘇産。昔卜居閘北某里。一夜寐後。於睡夢中。驚覺有物入古耳。急起挖扒。不得出。耳内隆隆作響。初不知究爲何物也。以爲日久可冀消滅。遂不介意。詎時經旬餘。耳根上端曁後腦骨際。奇療怪痛。時起時平。在滬遍治無效。月餘後。患處隆起紅腫。頭眩耳鳴。精神不振。旋買掉返里。經人勸往更生醫院就診。醫師惠更生。診謂内有毒小動物隱伏。吃血蝕髓。須解剖治療。顧聞醫語。心膽驚裂。當然惟命是聽。越宿住院。醫生施用種種手術。從右耳根畔剖開。直達後腦骨。察得内耳膜巳破。於後腦骨緣。發現瓜子大之臭蟲一枚。甚肥碩。鉗之出。猶蠕蠕然動。醫謂此蟲幸係雄性。未曾滋蔓。設或雌性。時巳兩月有餘。恐繁殖不治矣。嗣漸漸告愈。今尚健在。余當聞悉之餘。輒交夏令。未免談虎色變。於住居牀褥之間。以火油攪豆油。灌輸器隙。頗著成效。較藥水藥粉爲經濟。復恐其偷寨暗襲。就寢時以藥棉絮塞耳孔。以作綢繆之計。讀者如有此患。盍試之。</p>

<p>亦有西人前來游覽。過此荒原廢殿以北。乃一大河。自西向東。惟冬春其水涸。止餘細流。如菜園井旁之小溝流而巳。想夏日其水必滿河也。有竹林。竹葉甚大。男女樵采者。往來經過。女盡紅衣。如中國之觀音裝。蓋觀音乃印度女裝也。回至大學西偏小憇。余問人此殿塔何時所建。何時而壇。云不知。或云阿輪迦王所建。或云其後何王所建。蓋印人不關心歷史也。昔蒙古人亦云蒙古統一世界。然無史可考。各廟建築捐欵亦無布施名姓。彼甚笑華人之捐欵列名也。</p>
<p>佛會秘書爲錫蘭人。與拉好紳士戯論爭錫蘭與印度文化之長短。錫人謂錫蘭文化較印度爲高。無階級之風。及種種優點。印人當然不承認錫蘭優於印度。乃云中國文化較印度更古。余雖不信錫蘭文化優於印度。然頗驚錫蘭島人居然自負如此。敢於佛頂着糞。欲駕印度而上之。印人亦不信佛曾到錫蘭。而錫人謂彼有佛跡。頗有趣。余告錫人最好宣傳加奔特氏Carpaater之地理書。謂世界人種起源於錫蘭。要當夏姓曾居此。今有亞當橋。據此可自認爲世界人類之老祖宗也。衆大笑而散。</p>
<p>又回學校。路旁經過所見之人。多色黑。吾欲研印人色黑之故。大抵有關於種族者半。亦關於習慣。余見印人富家女子。修飾美好。與歐人同居。難辨别。華人無論巳。而貧人多黑。蓋由不修飾不講衛生之故。一由日光强。印人以同化於自然爲美。不覺其黑之不好。二其頭無笠。任日光之晒。不知遮蔽故也。然欲印人戴笠。又有問題。因印人好以頭頂東西。故戴笠亦不便。然欲修飾之美。則非改而戴笠不可。余觀印人亦間有戴笠者。千中無一耳。</p>

<p>承德棉織廠陳作霖志方昆仲。日前假普益習藝所。招待來賓參觀該廠出品衣内容。廳之兩旁。陳列各然呢絨綢縐。就中以兩面絨及碧縐爲最佳。前者足以對抗舶來駱駝絨。後者足以頡頏印度綢。實業次長趙晉卿先生覩是。獎勉有加。繼由該廠職員導觀工塲。先入織布廠。機共四十八座。馬達聲喧。梭穿左右。方織各種漂布。蓋以抵制洋漂者也。旋即登樓。入理紗室。千絲萬端。藉機械以分條清理。接綫頭則藉人力。最後折入織綢廠。機上方織綢葛之屬。各種花紋不同。花紋之異同。全恃機端之紙板。板各有孔。參次不齊。緯綫所經。爲孔所隔。花紋成焉。鬯觀移時。入席就飲。筵間陳氏昆仲復醰醰述其剏辦過程。並該廠勞資兩方之融洽。蓋承德廠規模極大。僅織機一項。共有五百座之多。主其事者。乃分爲九部。而冠以第幾廠之名。各有廠址。不相牽連。如是。在旁人視之。必以爲分則力散。開支浩大。殊不知工潮發生。反坐是得了無窒碍。凡男女工友之傑出者。主事者復力爲撮合。貸以婚娶之資。以二百元爲限。得由新夫婦按月拔還。故工友莫不感戴。而營業得以蒸蒸日上。誠别廠所宜效法也。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>「你替我開開簿面？」</p>
<p>「什麽東西？你又來胡鬧了。」</p>
<p>「寫福食零用四個字。」</p>
<p>「没有工夫！」</p>
<p>「你吃飯倒有工夫，吃了下去，對於吃飯，不肯盡一點義務魔？這本賬簿，是記小菜賬的，當然也是吃飯工作之一。」</p>
<p>「你自巳去寫罷！」</p>
<p>「我的字，寫得不好，要你寫隸書，才好看！」</p>
<p>「子良要伊快些下去，只有快些替伊寫的一法，立刻提起筆來，寫了四個字。」</p>
<p>「潦草得很！」</p>
<p>「寫了，你可以去了。」</p>
<p>「奇怪！爲什麽我一來，就催我走？」</p>
<p>「别來妨礙我！」</p>
<p>「我要問你一個字。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你！下面去罷！」</p>
<p>子良快要哭出來了。</p>
<p>「我不認得字，當然要問，不問你，去問誰？夫子者，夫子也。一定要問你。茭白的茭字，還是草字頭，還是竹字頭？」</p>
<p>「連這一點都不曉得，草字頭。」</p>
<p>夫人再要開口，子良用兩手掩着兩耳，打算不去聽伊了；忽然弄外一陣軍樂之聲，夫人一聽，放去手中的一本帳簿，很快很快的下樓去了。</p>
<p>這時候，子良曾清靜些；然而很掛念着。伊聽得了弄外軍樂之聲，現在趕出去看了，大門當然不關，萬一娘姨也跟了去，不是更甚於方才到後門外去看通隂溝麽？後門外，是一條路不通行的小弄，前門就不同，萬一闖了賊進來，拏些東西去，怎麽辦？</p>

<h3 id="c278">繼「隴海綫上」而起的國門之戰 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 贊</p>
<p>著者爲梁忠甲部下連長</p>
<p>—萬國安</p>
<p>從黄震遐君的戰事小說「隴海綫上」在「前鋒月刋」第五期發表後、頗引起國内描寫戰事的作者和一般讀者的注意自然、現在文壇上的作品、多半是以談戀愛發牢騷一類的東西、最受人歡迎尤其描寫三角戀愛式的文字、丨女人枕頭邊的消遣品、使我們不能不感覺到、文藝的形式、雖然經新文化運動而有特殊的改變、但思想的主潮、一般的嗜好、仍以變相的「西廂記」、「紅樓夢」、「兒女英雄」一類的作品、佔了中心、十幾年來的新文壇、無論作者和讀者、以此沽沽自喜、這是多麽「可恥」之事、</p>
<p>環境的需要、文學作品、决不能再讓「女人枕頭邊的消遣品」來統御一代的思想、其實、能夠衝破這個環境、打倒這些偶像的人材、未始没有、因爲現在巳經成名的作者、在過去的環境中、巳經養成一種牢不可破的習慣棄之不能、變之不易、無形中聯成一種勢力、阻止新的反抗力底産生、這也是無可諱言的事、</p>
<p>像「隴海線上」一類的作品、在技巧上、當然不能算是成熟、但是巳經充破了過去文壇惡劣的環境、而闢出一條新的道路了、這大概不至於遭人否認罷、我以爲文藝的價值、思想爲主要、技巧次之、萬不能抛開思想、專談技巧、我們讀一篇精緻的圓熟的作品、遠不如讀一篇富有剌激性而生氣潑辣的作品的滿意、一半固然是在科學文明的都巿生活中、不容再有「半日清談一局棋」的習慣和趣味底存在、一半也就是在國家環境如此的險惡中、不期然的産生出這一種反應的心理、</p>
<p>與「隴海線上」同時發表的、是萬國安君的「刹那的革命」、繼「隴海線上」與「刹那的革命」而起的、有萬國安君的丨</p>
<p>國門之戰</p>
<p>這一篇文字、也是用了小說體裁、來描冩十八年滿洲里中俄戰役的、萬君是十八旅梁忠甲部下的一位連長、身臨前敵、將一切經過的情形、很忠實的描寫出來、在史的價值上、似乎超過了「隴海線上」、</p>
<p>萬君於二十年南下、參加隴海線上的軍事、其時始與黄震遐君訂交、這篇「國門之戰」、也是經黄君慫恿而寫成的、文字一瀉千里、毫無修飾、純粹是軍人的本色、聽說將在「前鋒月刋」第六期發表、現在將黄君的原序、錄在後面、以見内容的一般、</p>
<p>我國自從鴉片戰爭以後、紙老虎的真面目拆穿、歐洲各國遂本其十九世紀政治侵略的方針、由非洲大陸一轉而移向東亞、屢次用優勢的武力向中國壓迫、這時統治中國的滿清政府旣毫無對外的抵抗力可言、全國民衆又絲毫不明民族存亡的利害關係、所以結果中國便遭受了隨便那一國也没有這樣多的國恥、陷入了奇恥大辱的次殖民地地位、統計這八十餘年在帝國主義者蠶食鯨吞之下的中國、除掉帝國主義者在、後半期裏兼用了政治和經濟的侵略不計外、單就軍用上流血犧牲的失敗而言、巳有鴉片戰爭、英法聯軍之役、「常勝軍」之役、中法越南之役、八國聯軍之役、以及最近的郭松齡之役、濟南之役、中俄滿洲里之役等等、他如紀元前十一年黑龍江上的屠殺、台灣義民的失敗、以及種種的小屠殺、兇殘的壓迫、尤其是無載無之、翻開數十年國恥的戰史來看、我們得了更可驚的紀載、</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭英帝國主義者前後用兵一萬五千（印度兵佔大半）、戰區擴大至廣東·浙江·江蘇三省、華軍抵抗的約在十萬以上、結果、英軍每戰皆勝、逼近南京、</p>
<p>英法聯軍之役英法帝國主義者前後用兵二萬、（印度安南兵居半）、戰區擴大至廣東直隸二省、華軍抵抗的約在八萬以上、在新河之戰裏、英軍首先試用了近代戰事所用的榴彈砲、當時他們對於陸軍大臣的報告是、「成績甚佳」韃靼騎兵的屍身漫山遍野」、法軍又特制八里橋紀功勳章、用以鼓厲「圓明園所施與黄色人種的一個小小敎訓」、統計這次戰爭的結果、自然華軍是每戰必敗、連首都也被人奪法、（當時英法軍的輸送隊都是廣東潮洲人）、</p>
<p>常勝軍之役這是英美兩個冒險者的成績、華爾和戈登兩人的奇俠故事、帝國主義者固要保存他們將來作爲經濟侵略中心的上海、又不便明目張瞻干涉中國内亂、遂慫恿這兩個冒險者組織常勝軍、仗着廣東海盜和浙江流氓的力量將忠王李秀成的攻擊軍打敗、造成了近日大上海的基礎、</p>
<p>中法越南之役法帝國主義者前後用兵三萬、戰區由安南延長至福建台灣、華軍抵抗者約五六萬、結果、中法兩軍在廣西安南交界之處血戰、法軍顯然有不敵之勢、海軍中將孤拔亦以福建的攻擊失敗憂鬱而死、但這次中國在軍事方面雖略有起色、而政治上的鬭爭却鬧了空前的笑話、將安南白白送給敵人、</p>
<p>甲午中日之役日帝國主義者用兵約七八萬、戰區從黄海到山海關、華軍抵抗者至少總在十二萬以上、結果、華軍每戰皆敗、日軍僅死傷四千人即將中國征服、</p>
<p>八國聯軍之役英法俄德美奥日義八國聯軍總數約七萬五千人、但實際上加入戰鬥的僅一萬六千、戰線長僅三百餘里、（從大沽到北京、）華軍抵抗的（義和團在内）共凡三十萬、但烏合之衆卒無濟於事、北京遂被聯軍攻陷、</p>
<p>郭松齡之役日本砲兵加入奉軍助攻、將東三省的革命消滅、</p>
<p>濟南之役濟南之役就是五三慘案、中國人儘管自巳宣傳說是無抵抗而遭慘殺、但世界軍事批評家的輿論却祗曉得革命軍被日軍擊敗、（近日美國新出版了一本名呌「東方的戰塲」的書、據說、「日軍四千五百人危然峙立於華軍的人潮之中、誠足以保持其沙河旅順的光榮而無愧、」戰塲上的無抵抗主義、西方人實在難於了解、）</p>
<p>中俄滿州里之役除同江密山的東線不計外、單就滿州里扎蘭諾爾的戰况而言、華軍前後用兵凡一萬五千、砲四門飛機兩架、蘇聯帝國主義者前後用兵凡五萬左右、砲二百門飛機三十架唐克車三十輛、結果華軍雖以衆寡不敵而敗、但巳加敵軍以重創、</p>
<p>在這接二連三般的國恥戰史裏、其中顯然露出不滅之光榮來的、自然不用說也是中俄之役、將這筆血染的賬單交代清楚以後、言歸正傳、我們便可以忠實地來介紹萬君國安所著的「國門之戰」了、據說、在滿州里之北十八里處、也就是中東鐵路從華境穿進西伯利亞的地方、有一個木製的國門、危然峙立於黄沙白草之中、孤獨地表示出我們邊陲的神聖、萬君便是以此爲題、用忠實之筆、將他親身所歷耳聞目覩種種悲壯之事、一一筆之於書、遂造成這篇我國對於赤色帝國主義凶猛抵抗的一頁記載、</p>
<p>全篇共約六萬字、作者就是這次作戰最烈的十五旅梁忠甲部下的一個連長、他以關外人的熱血、軍人豪爽的性格、直率地寫出了他的種種印像、處處充滿了愛國的精神、是由心田裏流露出來、絲毫没有一點虚僞、其中如軍人實際的生活、赤衛軍的凶蠻、砲擊時的緊張情緖、以及最後突圍時慘烈的種種犧牲、不但是開我國文壇上空前的描寫、而且除掉日本外、在亞洲各種裏也是一本不可多得之作、</p>
<p>回顧近來文壇裏創作方面描寫戰事的作品、例如孫席珍的「戰塲上」、氷瑩女士的「從軍日記」等等、雖亦有他們相當的可取之處、然而以對外戰爭爲作題材的創作、「國門之戰」却仍是佔了第一位、「國門之戰」的好處、除掉作者的技巧方面不計外、就是牠的「真實」、因爲事實都由作者親身經歷得來、也可以說就是他的一部份生活史、一篇「壯烈的日記」、</p>
<p>萬君當時又娶了一個俄國少女爲妻、却料不到她就是敵軍的間諜、在本書「間諜」一篇裏、作者很是以愛國之心高出一切之故、毅然將他的愛人打死、「總而言之、就是她爲她的祖國、我爲我的祖國」、爲了這層原因、他的愛妻丨流波丨便去做了「紅色英雄之墓」裏的一個鬼、而他、也在孤城落日的戰壕裏打到最苦的最後、懷了滿腔熱血、在烽烟彈雨之中突圍而出、悲慘地望着滿洲里的旗竿上、換了敵軍的鐮刀斧頭、</p>
<p>讀完了「國門之戰」以後、不覺得到了一個感想、中國人從前對於本國的軍隊都懷着一種輕視的心理、以爲中國軍隊和敵人作戰起來結果一定是慘敗、這也是歷來國恥史上所給我們的一個明證、然而讀者祗要看一看「國門之戰」、看一看那些用着不能應用的機關槍以抵抗數千敵騎衝鋒的勇士、看一看那他百名赤手空拳拿血肉之軀和坦克車搏戰的英雄、中國人、信仰你祖國的武力吧、</p>
<p>希臘人有色木巴里山峽裏的三百名勇士、日本人有旅順山下的大和魂、土爾其有普來佛那的奥斯門巴沙、法國人有滑鐵盧主死不屈的警衛軍、英國有巴剌格剌伐的經騎兵、丨我們也有我們滿州里氷天雪地裏的英雄了、</p>
<p>躱在關裏的民衆們、在大都巿裏燈紅酒綠裏的人們、在亭子間裏發着牢騷的人們、中國的青年們、你們還記得民國十八年十一月二十一日裏的那件事麽、你們還記得在六千里外、在黄沙白草或是湮地冰天的國門之下、有過幾千東北的健兒們英勇而恐哀地抵抗着赤色的恐怖麽、恐怕巳經忘得乾乾凈凈了吧、如果巳經忘記、請看—「國門之戰」、—</p>
<p>總之、這以上的祗是一些零散的介紹、將來有目共賞、自然會有人出來負担批評的責任、因爲從前在河南的時候曾經極力慫恿萬君將他口述的事寫成文章、現在他旣大功告成、而且寫出來的比他口述的還要生動有力、當然是很高興寫這叚小引、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic authorities believe that the Wanbaoshan incident is of a local nature and should be resolved locally, while the Korean anti-Chinese incident is serious and not a local issue, so it should be resolved by the central government.

In addition to telegrams already sent to Zhang Weicheng, Consul-General in Korea, Zhu Fu, Consul in Sinuiju, and Yang Zuo, Vice Consul in Wonsan, to investigate the details and report, it has also been decided to translate the truth of the two events into English and announce it to the international community.

There have been four overseas Chinese who have been brutally killed, and countless others have been seriously injured. The Japanese police outwardly show protection but inwardly indulge the rioters. They follow behind the rioters, and only pretend to drive them away after their atrocities have passed. At present, the overseas Chinese people are gathered in Chinatown and are in a critical situation, living from day to day. Please ask the government to quickly determine a policy to provide relief.

Last night, the Pyongyang authorities continued to send 20 policemen to the area. Official venues and newspapers have received detailed news of the riots, recording events such as Koreans beating Chinese people to death and setting houses on fire.

(8th Day Press Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Andong) The number of overseas Chinese west of Pyongyang who are close to the border and are successively seeking refuge in Andong has reached 10,000. The outside of Andong city is currently very chaotic and is being organized by the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

<p>No responsibility under international law.</p>
<p>Seeking relief for the victims.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, Shigemitsu's statement in Shanghai regarding the Korean incident is far from the truth. His attitude of protecting the Koreans is very obvious. (8th Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a formal protest from China regarding the riots in Pyongyang and other parts of Korea, its general opinion is as follows: This incident was a spontaneous riot by uncontrolled Korean rioters, and the state is not originally responsible. However, most Chinese people were victimized in Japanese territory, and the government should express its deep regret and seek ways to provide sufficient relief to the bereaved families of the victims. At the same time, the rioters will be severely punished in accordance with domestic regulations. However, the direct cause of the incident was the oppression of Koreans in Manchuria and Korea by Chinese officials and civilians. It is hoped that this problem can be fundamentally resolved between China and Japan. (8th Day Press Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following informal statement regarding Japan's attitude towards the anti-Chinese movement in Korea: The occurrence of this incident in Korea is a great regret in view of the overall situation of Sino-Japanese relations. The authorities must study the best way to deal with its aftermath. The Japanese government's explanation is that it has no responsibility under international law for this incident. Also, according to reports so far, the authorities have not failed to protect the lives and property of foreigners. Therefore, the issue of compensation will not arise. However, for the loss of the victimized overseas Chinese, it is planned to provide relief after investigating the facts. The government will, of course, punish the Korean rioters in accordance with national law. The Governor-General of Korea has prosecuted the rioters for the crime of disturbance in order to fully implement the legal punishment and resolve the case satisfactorily. The only thing to worry about is that the occurrence of this incident will have a bad impact on Sino-Japanese relations. Regarding this point, the governments of China and Japan should guide the situation with their best efforts. (8th Day Press Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Liaoning) Acting Consul-General Morishima visited Zang Shiyi at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, saying that if China adopts retaliatory measures against the Korean incident, there is a risk that this unfortunate incident will expand. It is hoped that the Chinese authorities will take measures to stop it. Zang replied that he had the same feeling and would immediately instruct the local authorities, etc. It is heard that the Japanese government intends to fundamentally eliminate national hostility. Regarding the solution to the problem of Koreans in Manchuria, it is planned to start negotiations with the Chinese side after this incident comes to an end. (8th Day Press Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zuoxiang, accompanied by Secretary-General Rong Shuyou, passed through Tianjin on a special train at 8 p.m. on the 8th to return to Liaoning. Zhang told people that the Wanbaoshan incident was because Korean farmers opened ditches, hindering the rice fields of Chinese farmers, and they had tried to stop it. The Japanese police opened fire, and the Chinese farmers lay on the ground to avoid it without resisting. They hoped for a peaceful and reasonable solution. However, the Japanese side exaggerated the situation, which led to the tragedy of Korean people hating overseas Chinese. Deputy Commander Zhang is very concerned about this.

<p>(Jilin) The Provincial Telegram informed Zhang Zuoxiang that the Wan incident was serious. Please return to the province to preside over the situation quickly. County Magistrate Ma of Changchun came to the province a while ago to request response guidelines. The authorities intend to resolve the issue based on law, reason, and fairness. Otherwise, it will be difficult to compromise. Japanese Consul Tadashiro seems to feel that the reason is wrong, but his methods are ruthless and it is difficult to sympathize with him. Students from the entire city of Changchun marched in demonstration today, distributing leaflets and shouting slogans. The people are full of indignation. (8th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Jilin Provincial Government Telegraphed the Details of the Wan Incident <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Wanbaoshan incident occurred, the anti-Chinese tide in Korea has become increasingly widespread, and the number of overseas Chinese victims has been huge. The Japanese news agencies are deliberately creating news, confusing the public, and reversing right and wrong. Because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urgently wanted to understand the truth of the Wan case, it telegraphed the Jilin Provincial Government to inquire about the facts of the incident. Recently, a reply was received detailing the following: In March of this year, Hao Yongde, a county resident, leased more than 400 hectares of wasteland in Wanbaoshan Village and planned to recruit Korean people to grow rice. The county government approved it to first investigate the content of the contract, but did not approve its registration. However, Hao Yongde immediately led about 180 unregistered Koreans into the country, digging deep ditches more than three meters deep, encroaching on a large amount of farmland, and intercepting the flow in the river to build dams, forcing water into the waterways to cultivate rice seedlings. The nearby people witnessed all the familiar land being cut off in two sections for no reason. Once the river dam is completed, the water will not be discharged, and it will inevitably overflow the banks from the waterway, and tens of thousands of acres of farmland will be abandoned. Therefore, they asked the county and provincial governments to quickly stop it. The county government then repeatedly instructed the people to listen to the government's review and disposal and not to lightly start incidents. At the same time, police were sent to suppress the situation. Unexpectedly, as soon as the Chinese police arrived in Changchun, the Japanese consul sent Japanese police to interfere, and the Koreans relied on this to resist even more stubbornly. The Japanese consul telegraphed back, and the Japanese Consul-General in Liaoning proposed a consultation with the Jilin Provincial Government. As a result, both sides withdrew the police for further discussion. The county police withdrew, and the Japanese police withdrew two days later. Then, the county authorities and the Japanese consul in Changchun agreed that the Koreans should stop work first, and a solution should be proposed after both sides jointly investigate the truth. The Japanese consul was informed of this. Unexpectedly, the Japanese consul completely rejected our conditions for restoring the farmland and stopping the river damming, and sent dozens of plainclothes Japanese police officers to occupy civilian houses with machine guns, entrusting the Japanese protection to inspect the work. As a result, on the 1st of this month, 300 to 400 people each held hoes to fill the various roads opened by the Koreans. The Japanese police suddenly opened fire on the people, beating and injuring two Chinese police officers who came to suppress the situation. After two days of disturbance, fortunately, there were no deaths on either side, but the Japanese side said that the Chinese police were secretly helping the people and forbade them from coming again, and increased the number of Japanese police. Therefore, a satisfactory solution has not yet been obtained.</p>
<p>(Jilin) The Provincial Government telegraphed the National Government that Hao Yongde's contract with the people in the Wan case was not approved and he dug ditches on his own, which damaged the national rights and could not be recognized. The Japanese News Agency is fabricating an atmosphere to provoke intentionally, but we are avoiding conflict as much as possible. The facts are there, and justice is intolerable. Please file a protest. (7th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The Central Government Notifies All Party Members</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the afternoon of the 8th, the 149th Central Standing Committee Meeting passed the important topics for the Fourth National Congress and notified all party members. The notice is as follows:</p>
<p>For the sake of notification, in accordance with Article 28 of the General Charter of the Party, the Central Executive Committee has thoroughly reviewed the party affairs and politics in the past two years, and believes that it is necessary to first announce the topics to provide all comrades with the necessity of prior study. Since the Third National Congress, the Central Government has gradually implemented laws and regulations and unified constraints in accordance with all the resolutions of the Congress regarding party affairs, and they have gradually become complete. However, the efficiency of actual work is still not as ideal as expected. This is due to the fact that the reaction has not been completely eliminated and the environment has not been completely stabilized. However, the organizational methods and work policies of party departments at all levels have their own shortcomings that urgently need to be improved. There must be a vigorous spirit in the overall work before there can be cumulative effects. There must be a plan to go deep into the people before there can be progress in connecting all levels. In particular, all comrades must have sound morality before they can inherit the great personality of the Premier and lead the whole people. As for the political aspect, in the past two years, due to the intermittent reactions and frequent wars, although there has been gradual progress in some parts, the overall plan has not been fully realized due to the time constraints. The National Assembly has made decisions on the overall political report. During the period of political tutelage, the Party has received the guidance of all the instructions of the Premier and the heavy trust of the people in exercising political power. Although we face all kinds of difficulties, how dare we deny ourselves? The Fourth National Congress will be held after the National Assembly, and all comrades should urgently determine the outline of all political facilities and strive to complete the mission entrusted by the Covenant. In accordance with the above two principles of party affairs and politics, the Central Government has first decided on the topics as follows: (1) Amendment to the General Charter; (2) Improving the Party's Organization; (3) Enriching the Actual Training Work of Party Departments at All Levels during the Period of Political Tutelage and Guiding Social Work; (4) Improving the Party's Propaganda Strategies and Determining the News Policy; (5) In accordance with the provisions of the Covenant during the Period of Political Tutelage regarding the People's Livelihood, Determining the Implementation Plan; (6) In accordance with the provisions of the Covenant during the Period of Political Tutelage regarding National Education, Determining the Implementation Plan; (7) Determining the Plan to Promote Local Autonomy; (8) Determining the National Defense and Diplomacy Policy; (9) Promoting Concrete Plans for Industrial and Cultural Construction in Remote Provinces and Regions; (10) Cases Left to the National Congress by Previous Central Executive Committee Plenary Meetings. Each topic mentioned above includes a number of simple topics, but the main principle is to review the past and improve the future. All comrades have come from hardship and suffering, and have served in the field for a long time, so they have gained more experience. It is hoped that each will base on what they know and see deeply on weekdays, and conduct practical research. In accordance with the methods separately issued by the Central Government, prepare proposals and collect them in the Central Government so that the Congress can have rich materials for deliberation and make correct decisions. This is hereby notified. (8th Day Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Strong Diplomacy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>When the Japanese previously pushed for the independence of the South Manchurian Railway, various parties criticized the weakness of Shidehara diplomacy. Now, with the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents, various parties are again criticizing the weakness of Shidehara diplomacy. We really don't know how it can be called not weak or strong. If it's not weak, then it's strong. We also don't know how it can be called strong. In modern international relations, fairness is advocated. Is it really reliable to be strong against fairness? Although a weak country is said to have no diplomacy, the human spirit will not die and will never be intimidated by violence. Countries that hold military force have always been hegemonic for a time, but have quickly been defeated. History has precedents. The so-called strong diplomacy is, in essence, backed by military force. However, in this world of embellished peace, although there may not really be a responsible and powerful adjudication based on reason, there will inevitably be some questioning of right and wrong. A country that is good at propaganda may be able to reverse black and white for a time, but there will inevitably be a day when the truth comes out. It is definitely not something that one hand can cover up, nor is it something that can be used everywhere just because it has military force. I very much hope that the Japanese will pay attention to all issues other than Manchuria and Mongolia in this situation of affecting the whole body, and do not be overly excited and only know to rush to progress, and disregard the principles of fact. I dare to tell the Japanese people in one word that strong diplomacy is not a foolproof strategy.</p>

<p>Industrialists Jointly Pledge to Guarantee Large Loan</p>
<p>Hindenburg and Brüning Telegraph the United States to Express Gratitude</p>
<p>Expert Meeting to Be Held in London</p>
<p>France Accepts British Invitation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th. Today, over a thousand prominent companies in German industry, finance, and shipping sent a public letter to the President of the Deutsche Bank, promising to jointly guarantee a loan of 500 million marks to consolidate the position of the Gold Discount Bank. The letter was signed by many prominent figures in the economic world and was completed within hours of the announcement of the US-French compromise on the Hoover Plan. Its value in reassuring people is no less than the actual value of the loan itself. Therefore, this move has had a profound impact. The general public hopes that this joint guarantee by so many large enterprises will instill new confidence in the stability of German finance and the future of the economy worldwide, thereby contributing to the recovery of the global economy.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. After the establishment of the Franco-American agreement in Paris, German President General Hindenburg sent a telegram to US President Hoover, representing the German workers and people in expressing their gratitude to the American nation and wishing that the plan initiated by the American President would open a new era of peace and understanding in the world. Hindenburg may also be continuing the policy of automatic national relief, so although the Hoover Plan has been successful, he has not abandoned the policies enacted in his current emergency orders, and after the establishment of the Paris agreement, he immediately issued an order reiterating the need for extreme economic reduction, stating that although Germany can now temporarily delay the payment of reparations with the assistance of friendly nations, the money saved should be used entirely to consolidate German national finances and must not be used to increase government expenses. It is not yet known how the various parties will react to this statement, but Prime Minister Brüning's unwavering attitude in enforcing emergency orders is already very clear to the people. Furthermore, major German merchants and bankers have expressed their support for the government's measures. About a thousand of these major merchants have jointly written to the President of the National Bank, willing to underwrite secured bonds of the Gold Exchange Bank to the tune of approximately 500 million marks, in order to maintain the bank's position and capabilities.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. The Franco-American Hoover Plan agreement has invigorated trading on the stock exchange. Prices in all markets rose today as the crowds rushed to buy. Although there were minor corrections in between, people remained optimistic and quickly recovered. Closing prices everywhere were the highest of the day, with important securities rising by as much as twelve pounds sterling. The demand for foreign currency has greatly decreased.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. German Prime Minister Brüning issued a declaration tonight, stating that the matter initiated by President Hoover with foresight and brilliance has been successful. President Hoover's achievements provide spiritual comfort and inspire hope for the future, and all quarters are pleased. This rapid decision to act demonstrates the great possibility of global recovery.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th. The French government has now accepted the invitation from the British government to convene a meeting of experts in London to study the implementation of the Hoover Plan. The meeting will be convened in the middle of next week, and its agenda will be based on the recent Franco-American agreement. Difficulties still exist for the future of the meeting, so there is a great hope that a major American statesman will agree to take on the role of chairman in order to engage in arbitration and mediation. Furthermore, the visit of German Prime Minister Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius to France is also attracting attention, but it is feared that this will be difficult to achieve quickly before Germany's economic situation improves. If France and Germany can get closer, all European countries will be deeply gratified.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th. Experts from various countries related to the White House will immediately convene to begin drafting a detailed plan so that President Hoover's proposal to defer war debts for one year can be effectively implemented. According to the Franco-American agreement, the United States will defer the payment of 262 million gold dollars in war debts. Germany must still pay 1 billion US dollars in unconditional reparations to the International Bank, but this will be transformed by the bank into German railway guaranteed bonds, and the railway will lend the funds to the German government. In addition, the part of German reparations that should be paid in goods will be decided by experts based on the spirit of President Hoover's plan. The United Kingdom has already invited the signatories of the Young Plan to an international conference in London to discuss various issues regarding the suspension of war debts.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 7th. British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons this evening that the British government has reiterated its invitation to the relevant countries to meet in London to discuss all issues arising from the proposal to suspend war debts. Aside from a few technical details that still need to be discussed by experts, France and the United States have largely agreed, so the British government believes that President Hoover's plan can be implemented quickly. France has exchanged views with the United Kingdom regarding the convening of an international conference, and US officials have also expressed their views in both Paris and Washington.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 8th. In order to determine the details of implementing the war debt deferral plan, the British government has convened a meeting of financial experts from six relevant countries. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expects Ambassador Matsudaira to report on this matter today. The Japanese government has already internally decided to send Commercial Counselor Matsuyama and Finance Official Hon'ai, both stationed in London, as representatives to participate in the meeting.</p>

<p>Focusing on Disarmament Issues</p>
<p>Proceeding Simultaneously with the War Debt Suspension Plan</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 7th. Washington has formally stated that US President Hoover intends to promote disarmament and the current war debt suspension plan simultaneously. Secretary of State Stimson's trip to Europe is for this reason. Recently, the Associated Press inquired about the attitudes of various countries in Geneva, Paris, Rome, Berlin, and London, and it seems that this move can receive the most favorable response. All parties say that in the past two weeks, President Hoover has transformed the atmosphere surrounding disarmament, and the situation of the Geneva Disarmament Conference next year has greatly improved. Because the suspension of reparations will reduce the budgetary income of some countries, they may be forced to reduce, or at least postpone, their naval shipbuilding programs and the expansion of land armaments. According to reliable sources, France and the United Kingdom are very willing to cooperate on general reductions and limitations of armaments, but claim that their reductions have already exceeded the limits that should be imposed in order to set an example. The British attitude was clearly expressed in Prime Minister MacDonald's speech in the House of Commons last week, and the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties, Baldwin and Lloyd George, both expressed their approval. Italy alone seems to be preparing to seek further reductions before the conference in February next year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th. The disarmament issue will be President Hoover's next diplomatic objective. President Hoover mentioned the arms issue when he recently gave a brief talk on the suspension of debts, so those responsible are convinced that President Hoover will take action.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Rome, 7th. US Secretary of State Stimson arrived in Naples at noon today. A representative specially dispatched by the Italian Foreign Ministry went to greet him and accompany him to the capital. Although the details of the US-Italian talks are not yet known, it is said that in addition to the much-discussed Hoover Plan, matters such as next year's disarmament conference will likely be subject to consultation, and there may also be intentions to mediate the points of contention between France and Italy that have prevented the conclusion of a Franco-Italian naval agreement.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. According to reports from Rome, German Prime Minister Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius will visit Italy in mid-August, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will visit Germany in return. If this is true, it would be Mussolini's first trip abroad in seven years. On the German side, Brüning has indeed invited the Italian Prime Minister to Germany, but it is feared that Mussolini will only follow convention and send Foreign Minister Grandi as his representative.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 7th. Italian Ambassador to Germany Ausonio Pironi visited Prime Minister Mussolini today. Pironi carried a handwritten letter from German Prime Minister Brüning, expressing his high regard for the Italian government's swift acceptance of the Hoover Plan, which gave the German people hope for recovery. Mussolini then asked Pironi to convey a reply, with extremely sincere wording.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e59">Advice to the Japanese and Koreans and Encouragement to the Chinese Regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, consultations between China and Japan regarding railways in the Northeast have been actively preparing for a formal meeting. The Chinese people are watching intently, hoping that in the future China and Japan can use sincerity to move from railway consultations to resolving all issues between China and Japan, supporting each other and jointly seeking the prosperity of both countries. Although there are rumors that the Japanese government and people have intense demands regarding our Northeast, we dare not believe that in today's autumn, when the winds and clouds over the Pacific are urgent and the slightest movement can shake the entire situation, the Japanese government would risk the disapproval of the world and easily disrupt peace on the Pacific. Especially since the bloodstains of the May 3rd Massacre have not yet dried and the rift between China and Japan still exists, each time Japan oppresses us, it only deepens the separation between the two peoples. The deterioration of the Chinese people's feelings towards Japan over the years is enough for the Japanese to consider deeply and at length. We even more dare not believe that the Japanese government would reenact a tragedy when the old pain of our people has not healed and the old hatred has not dissipated, forcing the relationship between the two countries to extremes. Unfortunately, like a bolt from the blue, the Wanbaoshan incident has occurred recently. We cannot help but feel grief, indignation, and regret over this.</p>
<p>In his memorial on an aggressive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia, Tanaka Giichi stated, "...The number of Koreans in the Three Eastern Provinces has reached nearly one million. This phenomenon means that the Empire's rights in Manchuria and Mongolia can be obtained without seeking them. It can truly be said that the nation has created immense happiness, and it adds countless forces to the Empire's defense and economy in Manchuria, showing immense hope in the governance of the Koreans." He also said, "On the one hand, we use the Koreans who have already naturalized to vigorously purchase rice paddies in Manchuria and Mongolia. On the other hand, credit cooperatives or banks, the Oriental Development Company, or the South Manchuria Railway Company in various places provide funds to Koreans with Chinese nationality, making them command posts for our economic invasion." He also said, "If the number of Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia expands to over two million..." The Wanbaoshan incident was triggered by the Koreans forcibly reclaiming rice paddies and digging waterways, arousing fierce resistance from local farmers in our country. As of today, according to news from various sources, the case is expanding day by day, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Rioters in various parts of Korea have even brutally murdered our overseas Chinese, and the Japanese government has been dispatching troops and increasing its military presence in our Northeast, as if some major event is about to occur. Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara even sent a telegram to the Japanese Consul General in Shenyang, saying, "...It is difficult to guarantee that the unfortunate incident of Showa 2 (i.e., the May 3rd Jinan Massacre) will not occur again... If the Chinese authorities ignore repeated warnings, the Japanese government, from the perspective of protecting Japanese residents in Manchuria, will have no choice but to take appropriate measures. As a result, an extremely serious situation may be brewed, which is unpredictable." (New Associated Press dispatch, June 3rd) From this, it can be seen that the various illegal actions of the Koreans are all planned and directed by the Japanese. We sincerely dare not predict to what extent the case will expand and become serious in the future. However, the Japanese people's violation of public reason and justice, and their showing the world their desperate actions with the dagger revealed at the end, make us recall the once-powerful Germany and Italy before the European War, and we cannot help but feel sorry for the Japanese and even more fear for them.</p>
<p>The Wanbaoshan incident, viewed on the surface, was caused by a minor matter. But looking into it, this case is actually the first shot of the Japanese's aggressive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia. We can easily deduce their consistent policy and planned preparation from the facts.</p>
<p>When Shidehara Kijūrō took office as Foreign Minister, his declared policy toward China was to be stable and restore the Chinese people's goodwill towards Japan, reversing the previous policy of violence and high-pressure tactics. Although his consistent execution of the continental policy was no different from before, his methods were indeed slightly more moderate. However, the ambitious politicians and military men of his country denounced him as weak and incompetent, humiliating to the Yamato race, and even called him a traitor in diplomacy. The whole country was clamoring, and criticisms came one after another. From top to bottom, they all regarded the so-called aggressive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia as a major issue, and there were arrogant remarks such as "We should sweep away the defects of diplomacy that only considers the faces of others, and we must have an active advocacy for the special status of Japan to the world." The government, under pressure from attacks by opposing parties within the country, in order to cater to the people and ease opposition, turned its aggression against our country into an aggressive one. This is the first remote cause of the Wanbaoshan incident. Since the Russian Revolution, the national system has been reformed, and its strength has been increasing day by day, far surpassing that of the past. The conflict of interests between the strong powers of Japan and the Soviet Union in our Northeast may re-ignite disputes at any time. The deterioration of the recent Japan-Soviet fisheries negotiations has made both countries feel uneasy. Japanese people with nervous disorders even said that the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is tantamount to a plan to fight against Japan, and it is almost inevitable that Japan and the Soviet Union will re-ignite war. To prevent conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, preparations must be made. And preparing for the Soviet Union must first conflict with our Northeast, so it is better to aggressively seize the Northeast and make arrangements first. Once the policy is determined, action follows. This is the second remote cause of the Wanbaoshan incident. Unemployment in Japan has been increasing recently. In order to alleviate the serious problem of domestic unemployment, they actively expel Koreans, who then flow into our Northeast, and transplant their nationals into Korean territory. According to recent reports, "When something happens in Japan, they use the Koreans as atoms and carry out military activities. They also use the pretext of crackdown to assist their actions." All these remarks, when verified with today's facts, are in perfect agreement. This is the third remote cause of the Wanbaoshan incident. From the above three causes, it can be known that the occurrence of the Wanbaoshan incident is the launch of the so-called "aggressive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia." Its inside story is certainly not as simple as the surface facts. As for the preparation for the implementation of the aggressive policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia, it is very clear from the appointment of Ugaki Kazushige as Governor-General of Korea, the appointment of Uchida Kosai as President of the South Manchuria Railway, and the increase of troops stationed in Korea and the change of the division stationed in our Northeast to a permanent station. Ugaki had served as Minister of the Army four times and had served as Acting Governor-General of Korea for four years. During the Kiyoura cabinet, he strongly advocated the speedy establishment of a continental policy. He also had considerable ambitions for the unification of policies toward Manchuria and Korea. Therefore, the Japanese government specially appointed him. In his speech after taking office, he said, "I served as Acting Governor-General of Korea for four years. At that time, I thought a lot about what I would try to do in the future. However, today's era is very different from that time. I plan to consider carefully and work hard to live up to expectations." The so-called "today's era is very different from that time" and "live up to expectations" all have meaning in the words, which are worthy of our deep thought. Moreover, his implementation of the military administration reorganization plan after taking office further proves that the Japanese government's appointment of Ugaki to govern Korea was a preparation for actual action against our Northeast. This is one. Uchida, as president, knew in detail how Japan's interests in our Northeast came about during the Russo-Japanese War. He was especially familiar with the situation in our country. At the same time, Uchida's views on the Manchurian question were consistent with Shidehara diplomacy. His three major principles for resolving the Northeast outstanding cases are: (1) Japan is responsible for maintaining the security of Manchuria. To prevent any unrest and shaking before it happens, the use of necessary means should be requested from the home government for prior decision under the understanding of the Chinese authorities. (2) The true mission of the South Manchuria Railway is to focus on the industrial development and cultural facilities of Manchuria and Mongolia. Japan should ensure its economic freedom in Manchuria based on its special relationship. However, this assertion of economic freedom does not intend to prevent the economic activities of China and third countries, and welcomes the economic activity of investment and trade by third countries to achieve equal opportunities and open doors. (3) Regarding railway policy, China and any third country are required to strictly abide by the main purpose of the Manchurian Rehabilitation Agreement. If China relies on the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, taking the principle of profit sharing as a prerequisite, within the scope of not violating the aforementioned Rehabilitation Agreement, the laying of cultivating lines for existing trunk lines can be recognized. However, the South Manchuria Railway should adopt a dual-trunk line policy and require China to recognize Japan's right to build the Jilin-Huining Railway. These three major principles are designed to woo the great powers with the terms "open door" and "equal opportunity," and to deceive our country with the terms "coexistence and co-prosperity" between China and Japan. For what they call acquired rights in the Northeast, they take a tough stance, indicating that there is no room for concession, and their advocacy of using military force as a diplomatic backing is especially in line with the voices of the mad politicians in their country. It can be imagined that he is an old hand at diplomacy. We can also easily surmise Shidehara's deep consideration when recommending Uchida as the president of the South Manchuria Railway at this time. This is preparation two for aggressive action against our Northeast. According to a dispatch from the Tokyo One Day News Agency, the Council of Military Advisors submitted the plan for the establishment of a permanent division in Manchuria, decided by the Three Chiefs Meeting, for discussion. As a result, the original plan was approved, that is, one division from the mainland will be transferred to Manchuria as a permanently stationed division. The current system of stationing a division for a two-year rotation will be abolished. Also, regarding the discussion on increasing and strengthening the Korean army, Chief of Staff Kanaya said that the current Japanese national defense operations are based on continental operations, so in the event of an emergency, powerful troops should be urgently transferred to Manchuria and Mongolia to seize the initiative and make the battle situation develop favorably. The opportunity should be taken for General Ugaki to take office as Governor-General of Korea to decisively increase. Minister of the Army Minami also said that the purpose of increasing the number of troops stationed in Korea is not to maintain law and order, but to use troops for combat operations. As a result, it was proposed to (1) transfer one division stationed in the mainland to Korea, (2) send one brigade of resident troops to the mainland, and (3) establish an independent infantry unit in Korea in imitation of the Manchurian method. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese government, in view of the insufficient strength of the West Korean National Defense Force, has increased the planned garrison locations in West Korea, passing a resolution through the cabinet. One brigade headquarters each will be established along the Gyeongui Line and at the Daegu Station, garrisoning one regiment of infantry, plus three special corps teams of cavalry, artillery, and engineers. In addition, one brigade headquarters each will be established in Daejeon, garrisoning one regiment of infantry. One regiment of infantry will be stationed in Jeonju and Gwangju each. The 80th Infantry Regiment, originally stationed in Daegu, will be transferred to Uiju. Seeing this kind of hasty movement of dispatching troops and their so-called remarks of "national defense operations" and "continental operations," there is no doubt that they are preparing for combat. At the same time, the recent Japanese Air Force exercises in Dalian City further prove that they are not only preparing to aggressively invade our Northeast with political means, but have also prepared for aggressive military action. This is three. The Japanese people have already made a determination to invade our Northeast and are fully prepared. Then, the occurrence of the Wanbaoshan incident this time is by no means accidental, but inevitable. Our people must not ignore this point. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Japanese Actively Engage in Aggressive Behavior</p>
<p>Jilin People Have No Choice But to Act in Self-Defense</p>
<p>Japanese Police Use Rifles to Shoot at Jilin People</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The case of Korean residents in Changchun digging up farmland in Wanbaoshan Town – according to correspondence three days ago – is a matter that has been repeatedly negotiated between China and Japan without satisfactory results. In the end, the provincial government insisted that the case should be resolved locally and need not be submitted to the province. As a result, the Japanese side exploited the Korean people even more severely, causing extreme anger among the Jilin people, which ultimately led to the unfortunate incident on the 2nd of this month. We will detail the past and present circumstances of this case as follows, and we urge the nation to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Case: This case arose because Hao Yongde, the manager of the Changchun Rice Field Company, leased 500 *xiang* of raw and cultivated land in Wanbaoshan, Xiangsan District, Changchun County, from twelve people, including Xiao Hanlin, Zhang Hongbin, and Meng Zhaoshao, on April 16th of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), for a term of ten years. The contract stipulated that "This contract shall take effect on the date of approval by the county government; if the county government does not approve it, it shall be invalid." This contract was never formally approved by the Changchun County Government. At the same time, Hao Yongde sublet the aforementioned approximately 500 *xiang* of raw and cultivated land to nine Korean people, including Li Shengxun and Li Zaohe, for cultivation, also for a term of ten years. This contract was also not reported to Changchun County, and its validity is naturally out of the question. However, these Korean residents dug waterways on the land, diverting the Yitong River, occupying more than 20 *li* in length and 4 *zhang* in width of farmland along the way. This land belonged to another forty-one people, who had no contract with Hao Yongde or the Korean residents Li Shengxun. Moreover, this waterway diverting the Yitong River caused significant damage to the landowners and farmers. The soil dug out of the waterway was piled up on both sides to form embankments, about seven or eight *zhang* wide and more than 20 *li* long, destroying more than 400 *mu* of good farmland in total. The waterway passed through areas of cultivated land belonging to the people, dividing the cultivated land of each farmer into two sections. Furthermore, to divert the water from the Yitong River for irrigating the rice fields, a dam was built across the existing river, forcing water into the waterway. As a result of the dam blocking the river, the low-lying farmland on both sides of the river upstream, totaling about 2,000 *xiang*, would be flooded. Moreover, the area that Hao Yongde intended to rent for rice cultivation was at a higher elevation and had no drainage outlets, so the low-lying fields downstream, about several hundred *xiang*, would be flooded. The low-lying areas on both sides of the waterway would inevitably be flooded by rising river water, totaling about four or five thousand *xiang*. In addition, the Majiashaokou area of the river was a thoroughfare for travel between the east and west sides of the river. Due to the dam blocking the water in the river, the water level rose, and the old transportation routes between the east and west sides of the river were completely cut off. The river was an essential route for Changchun farmers to navigate and transport goods during the summer. The dam in the middle was over ten *zhang* high, obstructing public transportation routes in both counties. Hundreds of households living along the river, who relied on shipping for their livelihood, also suffered losses. The harm caused by this matter was so great that the local farmers, whose interests were directly affected, naturally opposed it. After the matter was reported by the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office to the province for instructions, the provincial government, considering that the Korean residents had entered the countryside without the permission of our authorities, which was contrary to the public agreement, ordered the county government on June 1st to send officials to cooperate with the county public security police to persuade the Korean residents to leave the country peacefully. However, the Korean residents refused to leave. The Public Security Bureau brought their leaders, Shen and eight others, to the county government, who claimed that they were ordered by the Japanese to come here to grow rice. On the 3rd, the head of the County Public Security Bureau and the captain of the guard led a team, together with Shen and others, to the Baishuichuzi area, where they expelled the Korean residents who were working. However, on the next</p>

<p>Day, the Japanese ordered 100 Korean people to work in that area and sent five police officers to protect them, resulting in a confrontational situation, which is the origin of this case.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Course of Negotiations <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>On June 3rd, Zhou Yuping, the head of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, sent a letter to the Japanese Consul Tadashiro, expressing his protest. The letter stated, "To the esteemed Consul, according to a report from Changchun County, there is a large group of about 200 Korean people, along with many Chinese laborers, in Wanbaoshan, Xiangsan District, forcibly digging up farmland and diverting water from the Yitong River. The Public Security Bureau has repeatedly ordered them to stop work, but they have not heeded the orders. According to the claims of more than 200 affected landowners, the Korean people are digging trenches about three *zhang* wide and three *zhang* deep, and more than 20 *li* long. This trench work is being carried out forcibly and is mostly completed. If the canal is completed, nearby farmland of more than 2,000 *xiang* will suffer from flooding in years of heavy rain. The Changchun County Government has, on the one hand, taken Hao Yongde, who recruited the Korean people, into custody pending investigation, and on the other hand, presented a report to the provincial government, which ordered the implementation of measures to stop the digging of the ditch and order the dissolution of the group. Shen Yongjun, Li Fushu, Jin Longzhu, Cui Xiangji, Zhu Rixing, and Li Xida, representing 200 Korean people, claimed to the Public Security Bureau on May 31st that they were willing to stop work and return to Changchun as a whole within two days. However, on June 1st, they reversed their statement and said that they could not stop work or leave the country even if it meant death. The Public Security Bureau selected Shen Yongjun, Li Fushu, Jin Longzhu, Cui Xiangji, Li Xitai, Jin Taijun, Sun Binghao, Li Xiangyang, Jiang Rirong, and Park Chenglong, ten people in total, and sent them to the county for detailed interrogation. They all claimed to be people engaged in reclaiming rice fields and claimed that the leaders, including Li Xichang, Park Lucheng, Zheng Ti Yu, Li Derui, Xu Longyun, Li Zaohe, Jin Dongshan, Shen Hengze, and Zheng Yuanze, all lived in Toudaogou. The digging routes were all instructed by these leaders. After being stopped by the government, they immediately stopped. The leaders claimed that the land occupied along the trench route had already been rented, so they continued to work. The Changchun County Government is still investigating. It has been reported that there are more than 100 Korean people still working and not heeding the orders. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to continue sending police teams to order the dissolution, the ten people, including Shen Yongjun, who were brought to the city, were sent to your office for interrogation, and it is requested that serious negotiations be conducted to severely punish Li Xichang and the other ten people who instigated the forced occupation of farmland and hard digging of ditches. As for the damage suffered by the affected landowners, once it is investigated, we will then request that you order compensation according to the amount. It is required that the planting of rice fields must be approved by the government. Hao Yongde rented farmland in Wanbaoshan, Xiangsan District, Changchun Township, to open up rice fields without formal government approval, and Li Xichang and the other nine people colluded secretly and incited a large group of Korean people to forcibly dig up other people's farmland for more than 20 *li*. In the future, nearby farmland of more than 2,000 *xiang* will be permanently damaged. The government's prohibition was ignored. It is truly disregarding the law. In addition to handing over the ten people, including Shen Yongjun, who were brought in, to your consulate for investigation, we hope that all the main criminals who instigated this will be severely punished according to the law to demonstrate the law and quell public anger. All losses of the households will be investigated later, and we will continue to negotiate the handling of the matter. We also hope that you will quickly inform us of the handling of your side." Since then, after consultations between China and Japan, it was agreed to send personnel to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the truth, and then resolve the matter in a fair manner. During the investigation period, the Korean residents should immediately stop work. Our side should send personnel from the Changchun Municipal Office to investigate. As a result, it was determined that the rice field cultivation had not been approved by the government, and the damming of the river caused great damage. Based on this, negotiations with the Japanese consul continued. Unexpectedly, the Japanese consul still ordered the Japanese police to protect the Korean residents and continue the dam construction work. The Municipal Office sent another letter to the Japanese consul on the 12th, stating that the Japanese side should bear full responsibility for any disputes that may arise in the future. The original text is as follows: "To the esteemed Consul, Regarding the case of the joint dispatch of personnel by both sides to Wanbaoshan, Changchun County, to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the cultivation of rice fields by Koreans and the resulting disputes with the majority of local landowners and farmers, which are likely to lead to conflict, according to the results of the joint investigation, the dug waterway is about 20 *li* long and is indeed forcibly occupied land that was not rented with consent. It is also planned to build a dam to cut off the Yitong River, which hinders shipping and transportation, and the farmland along the coast will be extensively flooded. The water diversion plan is absolutely unacceptable. The results of the investigation were copied and attached to the letter yesterday and sent to your consulate for reference. Our office's intention is that since the waterway plan is absolutely difficult to implement, there is no harm in changing the rented rice fields to dry rice cultivation and amending the contract with the landowners to avoid disputes and conflicts. If the waterway land cannot be rented properly and you are unwilling to cultivate the originally rented rice fields, you can abandon the rice field lease. Our office will order Hao Yongde, the counterparty to the contract currently detained in Changchun County, to compensate for the losses to show compassion. As for the current losses of the Korean people, your consulate mentioned a few days ago that they amounted to more than 3,000 Japanese yen. Our office will order Hao Yongde to be responsible for compensation, which is also reasonable. Last night, you told me at 10 p.m. that you intended to "make the Korean people, who are poor and pitiful, continue the river and dam work today to avoid delaying this year's farming" The official was deeply surprised when he heard this. The consular office was deeply concerned about the strong opposition from the majority of local landowners and farmers before the joint dispatch of personnel by both sides for investigation. He was afraid that conflicts would occur and that the police and army would join in succession, expanding the unfortunate dispute. Therefore, there was a joint on-the-spot investigation in order to seek a peaceful and proper solution. Before the investigation of this case began and was resolved, the police of both sides were withdrawn and all waterway work of the Koreans was stopped to avoid conflict, which was also a prerequisite for the resolution of this case agreed upon by both sides. Now, if we abandon the principle of peaceful and proper resolution and order the Korean people to continue the waterway work, it will be a fuse for expanding the conflict between the two sides, which is a violation of the original agreement and a breach of faith. First, the Korean people forcibly dug the waterway without the consent of the landowners concerned, which could still be attributed to the deceit of the counterparty to the contract and a good-faith interpretation. After the investigation, the facts were clear, but they still stubbornly carried out the work, which means that all previous work was done in bad faith, and the consular office is actually the initiator of the bad-faith behavior. Second, China and Japan are as close as lips and teeth. There are hundreds of thousands of Korean people who cultivate and engage in business in the three northeastern provinces. Our country treats them equally without any discrimination. Now, we are provoking the righteous resistance of Chinese landowners and farmers by supporting the Korean people's illegal behavior of forcibly occupying civilian land and cutting off shipping and transportation. Once a conflict occurs, the losses will be unimaginable. For the sake of peace, both sides should only solve the problem in good faith and fairness. Neither side should initiate meaningless provocations. If the Korean people continue to infringe on the inherent legal rights of the people and intend to insult them, an unexpected conflict is inevitable. Third, the local authorities of our two countries should only adhere to the principle of peaceful and proper handling of matters, and major matters can be turned into minor matters, and minor matters can be turned into nothing. If we go against this principle, unlimited disputes can occur anytime, anywhere, with anyone, and over anything. Now, by secretly supporting the illegal behavior of the Korean people, we are determined to infringe on the legitimate and inherent rights of Chinese landowners and farmers. On a small scale, the local masses will have a permanent sense of disgust towards your consular office. On a larger scale, it will also provoke a sense of disgust in the diplomatic relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, and your consular office is actually the initiator of this matter. I don't know what benefits you are doing this for. Fourth, I have a very good relationship with your consular office on weekdays, and the feelings between the people of China and Japan are becoming increasingly close. I really don't want the feelings between the people of China and Japan to deteriorate, and I especially don't want your consular office to be the initiator of the deterioration of the feelings between the people of China and Japan. I am making this final admonition, and I hope that you will consider it carefully. If you are unwilling to accept it and intentionally issue instructions to carry out malicious actions, your side shall bear full responsibility for all disputes and losses that may occur in the future. I hereby solemnly declare this and hope that you will give me your reply." After this letter was sent, the Japanese consul replied, still saying that the dam had not been started and that the digging of the ditch was harmless to farming. He also said that the Japanese police sent there were exclusively responsible for suppressing the Korean people. Zhou Yuping, the head of the Municipal Preparatory Office, continued to send a letter on the 17th, hoping that both sides would handle the matter fairly based on the facts of the meeting, but the Japanese side, led by the Consul General stationed in Shenyang, met with Zhang Zuoxiang, the chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, and made representations, which were unsuccessful. At that time, the provincial government again insisted that the case should still be handled locally and was unwilling to take responsibility, which led to the delay until the end of June. The Korean farmers were increasingly anxious to build the dam because the harvest was delayed, while the Chinese people were increasingly resentful because of the heavy rain that caused the water in the paddy fields to overflow and flood the dry fields, and they saw that their fields were being damaged and that there would be no harvest in the autumn. They agreed with each other that if the Korean people continued to work, they would rise up to drive them away. They also sent representatives to urge the Municipal Office to make final representations to the Japanese consul, but the Japanese side had already decided on the policy of "local protection" and "promoting dam construction," and in the midst of the turbulent public sentiment, they increased the number of police officers and dispatched messenger pigeons to Wanbaoshan to strengthen protection. Our negotiations were without a trace, and the other party's progress was even more active. The people's hearts were indignant, as could be imagined. As a result, the conflict arose.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Conspiracy of the Japanese <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Before the Japanese sent additional police officers to Wanbaoshan Town, they purchased a large amount of food and transported it in advance, but they claimed that it was to supply the Korean people in the rice field area. According to the Japanese side, Tadashiro, the Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun, reported via messenger pigeon from the Japanese police protecting the Korean rice fields in Wanbaoshan, San District, that 500 to 600 Korean people in the rice field area lacked food and had no place to buy it. Even if they offered a high price, the nearby Chinese people would not sell it to them. Please purchase and transport it quickly for relief. After receiving the report, the Japanese Consul sent the Director of the Wubo Office to investigate and purchase a total of 270 bags of rice and six or seven boxes of other food. He sent four or five Japanese police officers to transport it to Misha Station via the China Eastern Railway, and then hired Chinese carts to transport it to the rice field area in Wanbaoshan, etc. However, when they arrived at the station and were about to unload, all the Chinese cart drivers refused to be hired when the Japanese police came out to hire carts. Even if they doubled the freight, they would not transport it. The public anger was aroused, and the people's hearts were aligned. It was found that Misha Station was more than 30 *li* away from Wanbaoshan. Even if there were no carts available, it had to be transported. Helpless, the Japanese police escorting the goods ordered the Korean people to carry them on their backs and shoulders and transport them on foot. The Korean people were slow to carry heavy loads, and the Japanese police whipped and beat them. The Korean people were angry but dared not speak, shedding tears and presenting a miserable sight. It took two or three days to complete the transportation. Later, the Japanese police transported more than 5,000 bundles of willow branches and more than 500 earth-carrying baskets, and supervised and directed the Korean people to continue digging ditches to divert water and building dikes and forts, actively working and setting a deadline of July 5th to complete all the work. They also forced the Korean people to sow rice seeds on the wasteland owned by the Chinese people, covering the fields. It is difficult to speculate on their intentions. According to the victims in the area who came to the city, it is generally observed that the Japanese police are forcing the sowing of seeds in order to expand the demand for compensation when negotiations fail.</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Anger of the Farmers <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese people in Wanbaoshan Town, seeing that the Korean people's work of planting rice and building weirs and digging trenches was not stopped, and that the County Government and the Municipal Diplomatic Office were unable to stop it, and that it would be difficult to achieve victory without the self-defense of the masses, specially convened a support meeting for the resistance of the Korean people's construction of weirs on June 30th, gathering the affected landlords and nearby farmers in Wanbaoshan Town. More than 500 people attended the meeting, which was chaired by Sun Langxuan. He reported on the purpose of the meeting and the course of the negotiations, and described the situation of the Japanese police supervising and directing the Korean people to carry out dike construction and sowing on the land. Then, representatives from various villages expressed their opinions. All the people were extremely indignant. Some advocated using force to expel the Korean people, some advocated self-defense and resistance, and some advocated that all villages should unite and take action to fill up the ditches and destroy the dikes dug by the Korean people. As a result, a president and vice president, and an executive director and vice executive director were elected, along with 30 executive members, who were responsible for handling the affairs of the support association. They were divided into four departments: documentation, investigation, publicity, and accounting, and it was decided to submit a petition urging diplomatic officials and the county magistrate to negotiate effectively. In addition, the executive members would unite with the affected villages and assign workers from each household to automatically fill up the ditches and destroy the dikes as a final struggle to achieve their final self-defense. The director of the County Farmers' Association also joined with leaders from all walks of life to launch a municipal diplomatic support association, holding preparatory meetings from June 30th to July 1st to study ways to deal with the Sino-Japanese rice case negotiations, and formulating regulations for each department, including investigation, publicity, documentation, research, and executive affairs. The organization is currently being implemented. Once it is in place, a formal establishment meeting will be held regularly to elect the chairman, committee chairman, and heads of each department, who will be responsible for assisting in the rice case negotiations and serving as a backing for the government. After this, whenever there is a local Sino-Japanese negotiation event, the Changchun Municipal Diplomatic Support Association will also assist in the investigation, propose suggestions, and submit requests to the Diplomatic Office to submit protests based on them.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Circumstances of the Conflict <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the farmers of Wanbaoshan Town, acting in self-defense, gathered four to five hundred people to fill up the trenches, but the Japanese police openly fired live ammunition at our farmers. The farmers jumped into the trenches to avoid the shots. The Japanese police fired 38 shots and stopped firing when they saw that our farmers did not retaliate. At that time, the head of the Tian Branch of the police station in the county-administered San District came out to mediate and temporarily persuaded the farmers to return. This scene of martial arts drama temporarily came to a stop. At that time, after our government heard the news, it made representations to the Japanese Consulate. The following are excerpts from two letters sent by the Municipal Office to the Japanese Consul: (1) To the esteemed Consul, Your official document No. 50 of today has been read and understood. The Korean people of Wanbaoshan have violated current laws and regulations and engaged in illegal acts without agreed contracts, infringing on the inherent legal rights of farmers and obstructing shipping and transportation. On June 8th, both sides agreed on a method to investigate and resolve the matter, with the withdrawal of the Japanese police and the cessation of the Korean people's work as prerequisites for resolving the case. However, after the fact-finding investigation was completed, on the 12th of the same month, your side sent plainclothes Japanese police to the scene to cover the Korean people's continued digging of waterways and building of dams across the river, violating good faith and deliberately engaging in malicious acts to infringe on the inherent legal rights of landowners and farmers. The farmers were overwhelmed with hatred and could not bear it, and were forced to automatically restore the original state and implement their legitimate means of self-defense. The motives were described in detail in official letter No. 183 on June 27th, as were the actual circumstances described in this letter of yours, in which the chief of our Second Branch went to suppress the situation and could not stop it. You should be aware that violent acts of aggression are not a good plan. The police officers sent by your side should be withdrawn in full to avoid conflict. If they are not withdrawn immediately, your side shall bear full responsibility for all conflicts and incidents that may occur, in accordance with this office's official letter No. 159 of June 12th. I hereby solemnly declare this again. As for the issue of compensation for damages between the parties concerned, once your police officers have been completely withdrawn, both sides will resolve the matter fairly and appropriately in accordance with the law and reason, based on the requests of the parties concerned. I have sent this letter to you in response to the previous correspondence. This is addressed to Tadashiro, the Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun. (2) To the esteemed Consul, According to a telephone report from the Second and Third Branches of Changchun County at noon today, this morning, the farmers of Wanbaoshan continued to gather to restore the original state of the river ditch. The Japanese police fired shots and implemented shooting, firing a total of 38 bullets. The farmers immediately jumped into the trenches, and the crowd was extremely indignant, each wanting to seize weapons to resist. They were repeatedly dissuaded and temporarily returned home to await a negotiated solution. Fortunately, no incident was triggered. Please make serious representations to the Japanese Consul to withdraw all the Japanese police immediately to avoid conflict. Your side has violated the previous agreement by continuing to send police, which is already a violation of good faith. However, when the farmers took legitimate means of self-defense and acted to restore the original state, the police sent by your side dared to fire live ammunition, which is extremely barbaric and unreasonable. Your side should quickly withdraw all the police officers who were sent immediately and give the police officers appropriate punishment to avoid further complications and increase all the responsibilities that your side should bear. This is what I hope for, and I hope that you will give me your reply on the handling of the matter. This is addressed to Tadashiro, the Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun. The Japanese Consul ignored both of the above letters and continued to diligently carry out the deployment of troops. According to people from Wanbaoshan, as of the evening of the 2nd, there were already 58 armed Japanese police officers in the area, setting up checkpoints and patrolling, which was extremely serious. Furthermore, at about 9 a.m. on the 3rd, the Japanese side sent 16 Japanese police officers and two baggage carts loaded with military tents and military food, two machine guns, and some ammunition, and dug trenches in places such as Majiashaokou. The situation was turbulent, as if facing a great enemy. According to people in the area, when the Japanese police and the farmers clashed and the Japanese police fired, more than 30 Korean people who were aware of the situation took the opportunity to escape. It can be seen that the Korean people are unwilling to be puppets of the Japanese. However, the Japanese are monitoring the situation very strictly and are refusing to back down. It is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop in the future. (July 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Summary Execution of Bandit Division Commander by Hankow Garrison Headquarters <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Hankow Dispatch: The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters summarily executed a bandit division commander, Wu Ying, at Liudu Bridge on the 6th. The charges are as follows. The Garrison Headquarters Intelligence Office delivered the red bandit's pseudo-division commander Wu Ying, also known as Wu Qingsong, requesting interrogation. After investigation by the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office, the bandit Wu Ying confessed to joining the Red Party, serving as the commander of the Bandit Army's First Independent Division, stationed in Zhengdaohu, Hanchuan. He had engaged in battle with the local militia. Recently, he was appointed by the pseudo-government to come to Hankow to gather information and re-establish Wuhan organizations. The investigation revealed that the bandit Wu Ying was a graduate of a military academy and had served as a soldier. He colluded with bandits and held an important position in the bandit army. His crimes are severe and unforgivable. In accordance with Article 1, Section 4 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China, he is sentenced to death as a warning to others. It is hereby announced that the bandit Wu Ying has been verified, bound, and taken to the execution ground for summary execution by firing squad for all to know. This announcement is made.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bing Chengyanxiu, a soldier who stole and sold firearms, was also executed by firing squad. In addition, the Garrison Command beheaded Zhang Ruiting, who supplied ammunition to the bandits, Zhou Peitang, who looted, burned, and killed, Wang Jianqing, who kidnapped for ransom, and Wang Yawa, Qiu Yushan, Chen Yushan, Liu Changgeng, Gong Chong, and eight others who robbed the Rongfeng Store. Furthermore, Xiang Zhongfa, a leader of the Red Bandits, has been active in Hubei for many years. Following his execution in Shanghai, the Red Bandit Central Committee issued an order to various regions to hold a large anti-white demonstration on the 7th in commemoration. Upon receiving this information, the Garrison Headquarters ordered the Garrison Command to strengthen defenses. Therefore, Wuhan was under undeclared martial law on the 7th, and emergency inspections were conducted at various street corners. (July 7th)</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>

<p>Handling of the Case of the Wanted Bandit Taibao Ashu, Following the Delivery of Xia Zexian et al. to the Ministry: The wanted bandit Xia Zexian, who was previously on the wanted list of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, was discovered by the Water Police First District Chief Xu Pucheng in Shanghai. Detectives were dispatched to arrest him, and he was brought back to the Minhang District office for interrogation. He confessed to joining the Communist Party and participating in gang robberies. He was registered with Luo Fugen and both were escorted to the Headquarters for interrogation. Upon arrival in Songjiang yesterday, the Headquarters Secretary Zheng interrogated Xia Zexian. His confession differed slightly from the District office. He stated that he was forty-seven years old, from Zhangze Town, joined the Kuomintang in the 13th year, was in the Second District Party office, in the 15th year he was an inspector for the Water Police Bureau, and in the 16th year he worked at the Changshu Public Security Bureau. Last May, he was introduced to the Communist Party by Zhou Zhigang and had no work. He did not know the bandit leaders Taibao Ashu, Zhuluo A'mei, etc. Luo Fugen confessed that he was from Zhangyan and was a cook at a Shanghai yarn factory in January. In February, he was introduced to work as a cook for Li Wenjun with a monthly salary of eight yuan. Because Gu Xiao'an was also cooking together, they took a photo together and he was unaware that Gu was a bandit. He asked for leniency. The interrogating officer found that the bandit's confessions were cunning and did not match the confessions made at the District office, and further investigations will be conducted to make a decision. According to reports, Xia Zexian was reported last year for his secretive behavior and was investigated by the County Party Headquarters and his party membership was revoked. Since then, he has stayed in various places and dared not return home.</p>

<p>Scheduled Continuation of the Investigation into the Nancang River Project: The Zhenjiang Court has completed the investigation of the Nancang River project complaint case. Therefore, it is scheduled for a public hearing on the 11th of this month. All summonses have been sent by the county government police. However, there are slight discrepancies in the people summoned from Xitang. In addition to the newly summoned river project inspectors Wu Yisan and Chen Jusheng, as well as the water pumping contractor Qunshuitang and six others, who were requested by the plaintiff Zhuang Tianmei to testify, the accounting director Jiang Duanfu and the clerk Tang Zixiong, who were previously released on bail, had their lawyers file a petition, so they were not summoned. The river project director Zhang Fengtai (also the Eighth District Chief) died of illness last month, so his family requested the withdrawal of the case.</p>

<p>Request to Revise Sino-Japanese Silk Tax: The Wuxian Association for Promoting National Goods, in view of the repeated oppression of Chinese commerce by imperialism and the constraints of unequal treaties, the long-term stagnation of domestic goods, the influx of foreign goods, and the deep suffering of merchants and civilians, is investigating that the original Japanese tax rate for Chinese silk sold to Japan and Korea is as high as 70% of the value, while the tax rate for Japanese goods sold to China is only 8%. The two sides compared are extremely unfair. It is urgent to take advantage of the Sino-Japanese treaty revision period to propose revisions in order to meet the principle of mutual benefit and equality. Therefore, it is specially recommended that the county chamber of commerce send a letter to the Sino-Japanese Agreement Tariff Rate Research Committee and a circular to related industrial groups to send representatives to convene public discussions on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Xue Jingqiu Falsely Accuses Good People of Theft: A woman from the Nan Shuangmiao Township, Madam Xi Yang, because her husband Xi Jinbao was falsely accused of theft by Xue Jingqiu, was detained and imprisoned. Recently, Jinbao died of illness in prison. His funeral was simple, and his family was destitute. He had an octogenarian father and a six- or seven-year-old orphan. Upon hearing this news, they both fainted. Lawyer Zou Binghu accepted this case and is handling it pro bono. Yesterday, he submitted a petition to the County Party Rectification Committee, requesting that it forward a letter to the County Court to immediately arrest the local tyrant Xue Jingqiu for investigation and prosecution in order to uphold justice and comfort the wronged soul.</p>
<p>The Entire Shili Datang is Submerged: There have been three days of heavy rain in this county, and the river has risen by three or four feet. The low-lying fields have become swamps, and the roads in the low-lying areas of the city and countryside are submerged. The Beitang area is a district where rice shops gather. Wheat has been on the market for days. The wheat collected by each shop during the day is piled up at the entrance of the courtyard. Unexpectedly, the river surged the night before, causing the wheat piled up in the courtyard to be submerged. When it was noticed at dawn, rescuers salvaged it, but the loss was huge. The road from Beitang Wuqiao to Gaoqiao, which is about ten miles long, is an important road along the canal. Now the road surface is submerged in water, two feet deep. Pedestrians detour and take the railway.</p>

<p>Flooding Disaster in Eastern Townships: Due to continuous heavy rain in Yiyu and other districts in the eastern townships of Nantong, the Huaiwei River has risen sharply, causing widespread flooding. The fields and houses in the distance have been submerged, and the victims have moved to the rooftops, crying everywhere. District Chief Ding Ziyan and others sent a telegram to the county government on the 7th for rescue. County Chief Zhang ordered all coastal sluices to be opened for drainage and organized emergency relief.</p>
<p>Resolution of the County Police Team's Funding Problem: After the Nantong County Police Team was expanded into four squads, it required an annual funding of 100,000 yuan. The local finance reorganization meeting decided to allocate it according to the previous county council resolution, with 40% from commerce and 60% from agriculture. The county government immediately allocated 60,000 yuan from the public security mu tax as the agricultural portion. The business community acknowledged the 40,000 yuan. Representatives from various industries met at the County Chamber of Commerce on the 7th to allocate the amounts.</p>
<p>Preparations to Establish a Water Patrol Team: The Nantong County Water Patrol Team has not yet been formed. The Civil Affairs Department believes that Tong county is located on the river and sea, with numerous ports and streams, and should be established urgently. County Chief Zhang has made preparations.</p>
<p>Investigation of Cotton Fields in Jiangbei: The Provincial Langshan Cotton Field investigated the area of cotton fields in Jiangbei this year. The counties of Tonghai have decreased by 5% compared with last year due to poor cotton harvest last year and the high cost of food. Lower-lying fields have been converted to rice cultivation.</p>

Because of playing around for a long time, the bandits grew bigger. The Provincial Government specially ordered all county governments yesterday that if there is a bandit alarm in the county, they should immediately dispatch a team and send a telegram to neighboring counties to suppress and eliminate them, regardless of borders, and assist in the annihilation. If they still regard the joint defense as a mere formality and allow the bandits to run around, they will be severely punished for conniving with the bandits.</p>

<p>Fleet Commander Returns to Shanghai to Report: Navy Fleet Commander Zeng Yiding, previously ordered to take the Yongjian warship and lead the affiliated torpedo boats to the Xiangshan Port for maneuvers, came to Yong to cruise. It is learned that Commander Zeng left Yong at 5 am yesterday, still on the Yongjian warship, leading the Yufeng destroyer and seven Sihu Sanshi torpedo boats. The Yongjian warship led the way back to Shanghai to report.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Reported: The Yuanjia'ao tomb in Fenghua, ten miles from the city, suddenly came with 30 to 40 bandits on the night of July 4, all armed with guns. They first went to the home of Yuan Zhubei in the village (Yuan is a secretary in the Ministry of Military Administration of the National Government). Because Zhubei was not there, they went to the home of Yuan Shiming, the richest man in the village, and kidnapped Yuan Shiming, who was nearly sixty years old, and burned down six or seven rooms of Yuan Zhubei's house. In addition, more than 10 bandits suddenly came to Gaolangtou in Huilong Village in Yindong at 1 am yesterday. They spoke the Taiwanese dialect and each held a pistol and short seven and scattered to rob each shop. The Suiyuan Rice Shop, Huatai Grocery Store, and Shengda Grocery Store were robbed, with a total loss of more than 500 yuan.</p>

<p>Strange Case in Wuchang: He Chengli, the son of the gardener He Bingchen, suddenly died on the 4th of this month in Hejia Vegetable Garden on Changhu Dike near Ziyang Bridge in Wuchang. It is said that he was killed by a monster. For a time, the city was full of rumors. After a detailed examination by the court, the cause of his death was unknown. The details of this case are described in detail on the left. The gardener He Bingchen has been working at the Xianning Station of the Yuehan Railway. The several acres of fields at home are all entrusted to his wife Li, his son Chengli, and his wife's brother Li Haishan for management. Recently, because the garden was full of melons and fruits, fearing theft, He's son and uncle Li Haishan built a shed in the garden to guard it. At 9 pm on the 4th of this month, they went to the garden together. He had just entered the door when he fell to the ground immediately. Li felt something pounced on him and also fainted. After a while, he woke up and took He to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he was beyond saving. The Wuchang Local Court was reported and sent personnel for examination. It was found that the chest meat of the deceased He Chengli had been completely removed, the internal organs could be seen, and the throat had also been grabbed. No drop of blood could be found, and there was no blood at the injury site. Li Haishan was examined and found to have scratches on the right cheek of his face and slight injuries to both arms. It was neither human harm nor animal injury. The court summoned and interrogated twice, but no clues could be found. According to Prosecutor Chen, who is in charge of this case in the county, the court has never handled such a strange case, but it cannot be attributed to monsters. He is now studying it in detail in order to find the truth.</p>

<p>I read in the Zhenjiang Dispatch column on the third page of your newspaper on July 8 that more than a dozen county magistrates selected in the second Jiangsu Provincial Examination, including Li Jinfang, prepared a briefing and visited the Provincial Chairman and the Director of the Civil Affairs Department to request an increase in subsidies. This is not consistent with the facts. Jinfang was indeed selected as a county magistrate in the second examination, but after reporting a major financial corruption case for the second time during his tenure in Liyang County, he was illegally suspended from his post by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. For months, he has been fighting hard for justice and is fundamentally opposed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. He disdains to accept any subsidy from them and has no reason to prepare a briefing to request an increase. This concerns personal integrity, so I request that your newspaper publish it in the Letters to the Editor column to correct it. I am very grateful. Li Jinfang, July 8.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Ministry of Education's Dissatisfaction with Students of Labor University <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The National Labor University was visited by Chairman Chiang last year, who believed that the order in the school was not good and needed to be rectified urgently. He reported it at the National Government Memorial Week and instructed President Wang to make thorough arrangements when he went to the Ministry of Education. However, for half a year, the University Department and the affiliated primary and secondary schools have still had disputes from time to time. A few days ago, because the affiliated high school had expelled students who refused to leave the school and incited a trend, the order in the middle school department was very chaotic. The Ministry of Education sent Section Chief Dai Yingguan to investigate and ordered Director Xu of the Shanghai Education Bureau to investigate together. The next day, the students of the university department of the school coerced the president on the matter of visit fees and surrounded and threatened him. The middle school students also organized and participated in meetings, coercing the president in various ways, lasting for five hours. At that time, officials from the ministry were also present and were unable to stop it. The situation was turbulent and unreasonable. It is now heard that the Ministry of Education believes that the situation in the school is so chaotic that it should be fundamentally rectified. President Wang had previously sent a telegram to the ministry requesting to resign. The Ministry of Education immediately replied in a telegram disapproving of the request. It is rumored that the resignation was approved, which is incorrect.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Jiangsu Province's 20th Year Education Expenditure Budget (4) Shi Zhang <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>(4) Reality and Possibility of Total Revenue</p>
<p>The total budget for this year is 4,880,000 yuan. Numerically speaking, it is 16,552 yuan less than last year (see the report in this newspaper on July 6). But in reality, it is not so. It is also permissible to say that it has increased a lot compared with last year. For example, the total expenditure of educational institutions this year is 4,491,155 yuan, while it was 4,150,472 yuan last year (see the report in this newspaper on July 7). Isn't this a clear increase of 340,683 yuan? However, the reserve fund and the temporarily allocated temporary expenses are not as much this year as last year. (This year's reserve fund is 95,388 yuan and the separately allocated temporary expenses are 293,457 yuan, totaling 388,845 yuan. Last year's reserve fund was 397,190 yuan and the separately allocated 348,890 yuan, totaling 746,080 yuan, a difference of 357,235 yuan. This difference is precisely the source of the increase of 340,683 yuan in the expenses of educational institutions this year.) However, the amount of these two types of funds has no deep relationship with the expenses themselves. Because the actual amount of income often cannot follow the budget, it has become an unavoidable phenomenon. Therefore, the amount of the reserve fund and the separately allocated fund naturally has sufficient elasticity. Even if the amount is as per the plan, in fact, when faced with a deficit, it is still set aside and attempts are made to use it. The reserve fund and the separately allocated fund in the 19th year totaled 746,080 yuan. Numerically speaking, it is not too much, but the actual temporary expenses only accounted for 180,000 yuan, only a quarter, and it was allocated after the end of the 19th year (details will be given later). It is not yet known when each school can receive this fee. This is clear proof of its elasticity. As for expenses, they are paid on time and no shortage is allowed, which is rigid and cannot be reduced unless absolutely necessary. This year's budget has reduced the elastic temporary expenses by 357,235 yuan, and at the same time, it has increased the rigid recurring expenses by 3,40,683 yuan according to the degree of reduction. This is an improvement in the budget and a responsible representation by the educational administrative authorities. The above-mentioned budget for this year does not actually reduce, which is the reason. After explaining the practicality of this year's budget, I will further talk about its possibility, that is, whether this budget can be fully realized this year. This is a very important point. The implementation of the budget in the past few years has inevitably suffered from the problem of false income and real expenditure. The constant depletion of funds in the 18th year led to the misappropriation of 540,000 yuan from the income of the 19th year. The repeated and delayed payments in the 19th year caused repeated meetings and expressions by the education staff association. These are the results of false income and real expenditure. Of course, the real expenditure is appropriate and there is no problem with it. The only problem is the "false" in the income. If the income can be real, the expenditure can also be real. Otherwise, if the number is false, then the expenditure will also be false, and various unexpected disputes will follow. So, can the income of this year's budget be "real"? To answer this question, we must first look at the contents listed in the budget, and especially look at the contents and comparison of the income listed in recent years. The income budgets for the past three years are listed below.</p>
<p>Item Budget for the 18th Year Budget for the 19th Year Budget for the 20th Year</p>
<p>Land Tax Grain Tribute 2,200,000 yuan 2,480,000 yuan 2,500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Slaughter Tax 1,200,000 yuan 1,280,000 yuan 1,300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Tuition and Accommodation 152,980 yuan 171,980 yuan 180,000 yuan</p>
<p>Provincial Subsidy 75,000 yuan 375,000 yuan 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Returns Old Debts 200,000 yuan 600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Old Debt Land Tax Collection 300,000 yuan 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Increased Revenue from Management Office 89,572 yuan 89,572 yuan</p>
<p>Total 4,017,552 yuan 4,896,552 yuan 4,880,000 yuan</p>
<p>Based on the table above, a rough calculation can be made. (1) In the 18th year, 540,000 yuan from the income of the 19th year was misappropriated, so the actual income for that year was at most 3,500,000 yuan. (2) In the 19th year, although the time has passed, the income and expenditure have not ended. In fact, each school's expenses have only been paid up to the first half of May. In the previous year, there were still one and a half months (up to June) owed, with an average of 400,000 yuan per month and one and a half months amounting to 600,000 yuan. Then, the amount received was at most 4,300,000 yuan. (In fact, it is absolutely impossible to receive this amount). Adding the 540,000 yuan misappropriated from the 18th year, then the shortfall for the previous year, as of this time, should be more than one million. The amount of one million is huge. (3) If there are other ways to make up for the above-mentioned deficit, then even if this year's income is completely real, it cannot be free from its constraints and influence. What's more, whether this year's income is real or not is still a problem. Therefore, the reporter is not optimistic about this year's budget.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a step back and just predict the income situation for this year's budget, and explain each income item one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e83">(I) 田賦 Appropriation of Funds <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>This year's allocation is listed as 2,500,000 yuan, which is less than the previous two years (the previous year was 2,500,000 yuan [including both land tax and old arrears collection], and the year before that was 2,780,000 yuan). This is naturally because there was an understanding of the unreliability of previous collections and preparations were made accordingly. It has been determined that the allocation of Jiangsu Province's education funds from land tax stems from the nationalization of the cigarette tax funds that were originally used for education. Previously, a "dispatch of funds" method was used, initially set at 1,800,000 yuan, which was subsequently gradually increased. However, the funds dispatched to various counties often fell short of the required amount, so a "appropriation" method was adopted (that is, 4 jiao were extracted from each shi of Cao rice regular tax, 2 jiao and 2 fen from each liang of Mang silver regular tax, and 2 jiao and 5 fen from each liang of Mang silver provincial tax). After many twists and turns, the provincial government's education department, finance department, education funding committee, and education funding management office negotiated back and forth dozens of times. From March of the 17th year, until the 292nd meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government on May 9th of the 19th year, it was resolved that "starting from the Cao Mang tax collection of the 18th year, the distribution will be implemented, and the Finance Department will be ordered to comply; old arrears will be cleared separately." The "distribution" method was thus finally implemented. In the past year or so, the amounts remitted by various counties have gradually improved. In the first year of implementation, the reported amounts were inevitably slightly inferior. This year is considered the second year of implementation, and it should be better. Therefore, this income is expected to be reliable, or it may even exceed the amount of 2,500,000 yuan. Didn't the above mention that the budgeted amounts for the previous two years were higher than this year? Furthermore, on March 14th of this year, the Finance Department sent a letter to the management office and funding committee stating, "After investigating the special education funds appropriated from land tax, which are extracted from our department's collection of Ding Cao and reed taxes on a per-liang and per-shi basis, the standard for budgeted income should be calculated based on the average of the actual collection amounts of Liang and Shi from the autumn surveys of the past three years, and then converted at 4 jiao and 7 fen per Liang and 1 yuan and 4 jiao per Shi. According to this standard, the annual special education funds appropriated should be approximately 3.22 million yuan. However, the budget for the 19th year only lists 2.78 million yuan, a difference of more than 400,000 yuan, which is inconsistent with the overall land tax amount. Now that we are handling the budget for the 20th year, we are specially listing the average actual collection amounts from the autumn surveys of the past three years and the special education funds that should be appropriated (see below) and attaching them for your review. Please list them as the budget for the 20th year based on the amounts listed in the list, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous year." The detailed items are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The average actual collection of land Ding tax for three years is 2,550,625 liang, and 4 jiao and 7 fen are allocated per liang, totaling 1,198,793 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) The average actual collection of Cao rice for three years is 1,400,132 shi, and 1 yuan and 4 jiao are allocated per shi, totaling 1,960,185 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) The average actual collection of reed tax for three years is 147,922 liang.</p>
<p>4 jiao and 7 fen are allocated per liang, totaling 69,523 yuan.</p>
<p>The total of the above three items that should be allocated is 3,228,501 yuan. Judging from this, it is possible that this income will exceed the budgeted amount by a certain amount. However, land tax is directly proportional to the harvest. If this year's harvest is not very good, there may not be much hope for excess revenue. However, there can be a considerable degree of certainty regarding the listed amounts.</p>
<h3 id="e84">(II) Slaughter and Tooth Tax <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>There has been little increase in recent years, and the collected amount is quite reliable. The surplus bonus for the tooth tax in March of this year reached more than 12,470 yuan, which gives an idea of its surplus situation.</p>
<h3 id="e85">(III) School Accommodation Fees <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The amount is reliable and there are no problems. However, various schools are often unwilling to remit the funds as required, wanting to retain them for other uses. If in the future we can achieve the point where the reported amount matches the remitted amount, that will be sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e86">(IV) Provincial Treasury Subsidy <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>This subsidy can be considered an additional income. In fact, isn't the 2 to 3 million yuan appropriated from land tax originally funds belonging to the provincial treasury? Because the provincial budget has gradually increased in recent years, while the dispatched and appropriated funds have a fixed amount and cannot be easily increased, and the education undertaking is continuing to develop, this special subsidy has been provided. It is estimated that half was received in the 17th year, one-third was received in the 18th year, and the full amount will be gradually received in the 19th year. It is expected that there will be no further arrears within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e87">(V) Repayment of Old Arrears by the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The 200,000 yuan from last year has not yet been received, and this year it has even increased to 600,000 yuan, which is feared to be even more hopeless. It is heard that when the education funding committee discussed this year's budget, everyone believed that there was no certainty at all and did not know how to ensure that the full amount could be received in the future.</p>
<p>In summary, the practicality and possibility of this year's budget are greater than last year's. If the situation can be stable and harvests are bountiful, then the degree of nominal income and actual expenditure can hopefully improve. Is this the new dawn of Jiangsu's educational future? (To be continued)</p>

<p>South Grass Court Did Not Come丨China Club Waited in Vain</p>
<p>All Five Groups Did Not Compete丨Dates Can Be Accommodated</p>
<p>The Group A tennis league of the Grass Court Tennis Club was scheduled to begin yesterday. The opponent for the China Tennis Club was the South Grass Court of the Race Course. The match was to be held at the China Tennis Club court. The entire China Club team was ready to play, and Qiu Feihai, Jiang Daozhang, Yu Tianguang, and others were all present. However, the designated time had passed, and the South Grass Court players did not arrive. Even by sunset, there was still no news. As the China Club was the home team, if a postponement was necessary, they should have been notified by telegram. As there was no communication, it should be considered a forfeit. The China Club won 15-0 by default. However, the Grass Court Club's regulations do not explicitly state this. The China Club has sent a letter to inquire as to why they did not come, wasting hundreds of people's time. They are also asking whether it was a forfeit and whether a rematch should be held, etc. The China Club members later switched to a members' practice match, with Qiu, Jiang, and others forming a doubles team for practice.</p>
<h3 id="e91">All Matches Canceled <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>

<h3 id="e96">The East China Sports Company Sponsors the Chinese Student Shanghai Tennis Championship <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Registration Begins Immediately, Deadline is Noon on the 18th</p>
<p>Singles and Doubles Matches Held Every Other Day Starting from the 20th</p>
<p>The East China Sporting Goods Company, with the aim of promoting sports, has been sparing no effort in encouraging amateur sports since its establishment, in addition to selling various sports equipment. As the tennis season is approaching, and seeing that there are many masters in various schools in Shanghai, although there are various competitions at ordinary times, they cannot be brought together due to different organizations or groups. The only open competition is the Chinese Open Tennis Tournament held by the Chinese Athletic Association. However, it should be known that the more competitions there are in sports, the more intense the competition will be, and the skills will become more refined as a result. Looking back at various countries in Europe and the United States, the number of competitions held each year is countless. Even in New York State in the United States, there are dozens of competitions in one season. No wonder they have always held the leading position in the world. Even in nearby Japan, its rapid progress is truly astonishing, and it is also the result of rigorous training and fierce competition. Recently, Canadian Davis Cup representatives Andrew and Duff returned to Shanghai from a competition in Japan. They talked about the progress of their skills and the number of talented people in various schools, which should be a serious warning to our people. The East China Sporting Goods Company also firmly believes that to cultivate talents, one must start from the schools. Therefore, it has decided to hold the Chinese Student Shanghai Tennis Championship. Any student studying at any school in Shanghai (including those who have graduated this year but have not held positions in institutions) can join, regardless of whether it is a university or middle school. Students from other cities who are currently in Shanghai can also participate. This time, the company has also negotiated with the British Sporting Goods Company, A. G. Spalding and Bros (Br Ltd), to donate several Spalding Top Flite rackets as prizes. These rackets are specially made in England, and the weight and handle size can be selected by the individual to ensure suitability. The racket will also be printed with the championship competition and the individual's name as a souvenir. As for the balls used in the competition, they will all be provided by the East China Sporting Goods Company and will all be Spalding brand, using new balls each time. There are also other prizes, which are still in progress. In short, this competition is a new initiative in the tennis world. Who knows if future talents for our country will not be produced from this? The registration location is the East China Sporting Goods Company, 10 Nanjing Road Central Road. Registration will be open from today until noon on the 18th. The competition is scheduled to begin on the 20th, with singles and doubles matches held every other day, and will last approximately three weeks. The selection of doubles partners is up to the individuals and is not limited to the same school. In the future, the heroes of various schools will gather together and there will be a fierce competition. It is hoped that all sectors will provide enthusiastic support and participate in this grand event. The competition rules are attached below.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Ministry of Communications Took Over Yangtze Wharf Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Also Detained a Small Steamer</p>
<p>The Outstanding Rent Will Still be Prosecuted According to Law</p>
<p>The Japanese firm Ocean Society rented the Ministry of Communications' property, the Yangtze Wharf in Pudong, but refused to pay rent. After the Ministry of Communications sent a representative, Xu Shidan, to Shanghai, in addition to formally notifying the general manager of the Ocean Society, Mr. Chuan Yue, by official letter a few days ago, and personally meeting with the manager in the morning to request the return, he also went to receive it yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, accompanied by the Navigation Bureau's technicians Zeng Shoulian and Ding Yanling, staff Xu Yiqun, Cai Yun, Feng Heqin, and Chen Weixian, as well as Tang Jinghuan, the chief of the Sixth Precinct of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau in Pudong, leading five policemen, and Mr. Einler, a surveyor from the American Shipping Company recognized by the American government. When Representative Xu and others first arrived, the wharf manager, a Japanese named He Zhishang, refused to hand it over. After the Japanese person inquired with the manager by telephone, he handed it over. Xu and others, along with the notary public, American surveyor Einler, inquired about each warehouse, etc., and confirmed that there were no goods stored in any of them, and then sealed them with tape, ready for inspection today. In addition, the company had a small steamer when renting the wharf. Because the Ministry of Communications' representative did not see the original steamer, they detained a small steamer of about 45 feet moored at the wharf yesterday for compensation. Moreover, Representative Xu saw that the small steamer did not have any flag hanging, so he put up the Chinese national flag and hung it at the stern. Regarding future measures, Xu Shidao told the New Sound News Agency yesterday that after the Ministry of Communications recovers the wharf, it will prepare to take legal action to recover the rent owed. The matter has now been handled by lawyer Jiang Tianduo. Furthermore, the wharf is now in a terrible state of disrepair due to the damage caused by the Japanese. According to the original regulations, the tenant must repair any damage to the satisfaction of the owner. Because it is in such a bad state today, the Ministry of Communications has instructed the American surveyor Einler to estimate the maximum amount of damage in order to demand compensation from the company.</p>
<p>Yu Da Collision Case Concluded</p>
<p>Foreign Warships Prohibited from Conducting Exercises</p>
<h3 id="e105">Pasten Case Resolved <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In the case of the collision between the Yu Da steamer and the British submarine Pasten, which was conducting exercises in the waters of Liugong Island in Chengshan Bay, Shandong, the Yu Da shipowner proved that the submarine was at fault. The British naval commander in China also held that the accident was caused by the Pasten's captain, so he dismissed the captain as punishment. Regarding the sunken ship, divers were sent into the sea for inspection. Later, because the seabed at the location of the sinking was very deep, it could not be salvaged. The ship will be temporarily abandoned. The bow of the Yu Da steamer was also damaged and has been repaired. It will continue to sail as usual. The British Navy also believes that the Yu Da steamer is not responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Shipping Association Requests Ban on Naval Exercises <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, the Shanghai Shipping Association submitted it to the 14th Executive Committee for discussion. It was agreed that in recent years, British, American, and other foreign warships have often conducted naval exercises within our country's territorial waters, which seriously hinders navigation. As in the Yu Da case, the foreign warships' exercises obstructed the merchant ships. It was resolved that the Shipping Association should submit reasons to the Ministries of Communications and Foreign Affairs, requesting them to inform all countries to prohibit foreign warships and submarines from conducting exercises in our territorial waters in the future, in order to prevent future crises for merchant ships and avoid major disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Telegram from Overseas Chinese in Seoul Requesting Assistance <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>All Overseas Chinese in Korea are in Grave Danger</p>
<p>The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, Korea, yesterday telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the anti-Chinese sentiment incited by the Koreans, stating, "To the esteemed Chamber of Commerce: The Wanpaoshan-Sanxingbao incident and subsequent Jiangxian News extra editions allege that Chinese officials and civilians attacked Korean residents, creating a dire situation, which has incited widespread hostility among Koreans. Following this, Consul General Zhang petitioned the Governor-General for protection. However, last night's riots were the most severe, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, affecting hundreds of families, exceeding the severity of the 1927 incident tenfold. Large-scale riots also broke out in Incheon and Pyongyang, with countless casualties. All overseas Chinese in Korea are in grave danger. It seems that hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese will die without burial. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for investigation, we respectfully telegraph this appeal, earnestly requesting you to forward it to various newspapers for unified assistance and urgent rescue of Chinese lives. Every moment is critical. We await your esteemed orders." Respectfully, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, Korea. Yang.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Protests from All Sectors Against the Anti-Chinese Incident by Koreans <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The anti-Chinese riots instigated by Japanese imperialists among the Korean people have been increasingly widespread in recent days. All sectors across the country are filled with extreme indignation, and party branches at all levels in this city are even more agitated, actively advocating and appealing through continuous efforts, sending numerous letters and telegrams to vehemently protest. The documents and telegrams received from various parties yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e109">Declaration by the First District Party Branch <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>(Omitted opening). Recently, reports indicate that Japanese military police in the Majiashaokou area of Wanpaoshan, Changchun County, incited Korean people to forcibly cultivate the fields of our Chinese people, destroy roads, build dikes, and block waterways, leading to public outrage among the Chinese people and resulting in disputes. Japanese military police then surrounded our farmers and opened fire with machine guns, injuring hundreds of Chinese and killing dozens. Alas, the brutality of the Japanese military police and the recklessness of the Korean people! These Chinese farmers’ fields are under Chinese sovereignity. Why would Korean people steal through banditry? The Japanese military police should not indiscriminately fire, treating Chinese lives as worthless, disregarding humanitarian law and international trust. Moreover, the Korean people, descendants of our Jizi, have become an oppressed nation. They should stand together with our party under the banner of supporting weak and small nations, striving to overthrow the hideous and detestable imperialists, rather than doing the opposite and recognizing the thief as their father, which is both hateful and pitiable. However, the instigator is the Japanese imperialists; the Korean people are merely tools of the Japanese imperialists. Fellow compatriots, let us all rise up, unite against external forces, demand punishment for the culprits, compensation, and guarantees for the future. We must seize this momentum to overthrow the red and white imperialists and build the Great Harmony world advocated by the Premier. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Circular Telegram from the Fifth District Party Branch <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Having repeatedly read reports that the Japanese, using the Wanpaoshan incident as a pretext, incited Korean people on the border of Jilin to clash with Chinese people, resulting in hundreds of Chinese casualties, we cannot help but be alarmed and dismayed upon hearing this news. Korea is a small and weak nation, subjugated by Japan and subjected to Japanese oppression, as is known throughout the world. Instead of thinking of resistance to break free from the shackles of Japanese imperialism, they willingly allow themselves to be used by Japan to commit acts of slaughter against our Chinese people. Such irrational and barbarous acts are truly hateful. Japan's coveting of our Manchuria has not been a recent event. However, Japan's past policies of aggression have not been as brutal and cruel as this recent instigation of Korean riots. Japan's ambition to invade Manchuria has remained consistent, but its methods of aggression have become increasingly heinous. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? If this incident is not handled with serious negotiations to ensure Japan fulfills conditions such as compensation and apologies, then Japan will become even more reckless in the future, treating Chinese people as worthless and subjecting them to all kinds of humiliation and oppression. The Party Branch in this district feels a sense of crisis and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specifically issue this circular telegram, urging all sectors of the country to rise up and fight.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Circular Telegram from the Two Railways Party Branch <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>All newspaper offices are hereby notified that recently Japanese military police, in the Wanpaoshan area under the jurisdiction of Changchun County, protected Korean residents who forcibly planted rice fields, dug up and destroyed our national land, and arbitrarily built dikes and dams, cutting off water transportation, and surrounded our farmers. The police even used machine guns to shoot and kill many farmers and police officers, turning it into the second Jinan Massacre. The blood of the martyrs has not yet dried, and the national calamity has arrived again. Furthermore, the Korean people, as subjects of a fallen nation, willingly allow themselves to be driven and act as puppets, taking the opportunity to instigate an increasingly fierce anti-Chinese movement. In recent days, there have been riots in various places in Korea, including Pyongyang and Incheon, attacking our overseas compatriots, streets and markets, and destroying the homes of our overseas compatriots. The situation in Seoul is particularly dangerous, with nearly a hundred deaths and nearly a thousand injuries. How could there be such a planned anti-Chinese movement in various parts of Korea at the same time? It is obvious that someone is instigating and directing it, and it does not require wisdom to know this. The Japanese have long regarded our three northeastern provinces as being in their pocket, but due to various international relations, they are unable to actively invade. Recently, seeing that our country's political reforms have gradually succeeded, they fear that they will no longer have the opportunity to invade. Therefore, their covetous heart has become more urgent, and their methods have become more ruthless. The Wanpaoshan incident is only the beginning of their provocation. But alas, our overseas compatriots have been brutally killed, injured, displaced, and have no way to appeal. Anyone with a conscience cannot help but be filled with indignation. The Japanese's violent oppression against us has repeatedly been inhumane. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We hope that all the people of our country will rise up and pursue the matter to the end, insist on reason, and strive for justice, not stopping until we achieve the purpose of punishing the murderers, providing compensation and relief to all the losses of overseas compatriots, and guaranteeing that the same situation will not happen again in the future. We beg for your consideration. Special Party Department Executive Committee of the Jinghu-Huhang Railway of the Chinese Kuomintang Geng.</p>

<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang received repeated telegrams from Wang Shuhan, Chief Secretary of the National Government, from Peiping, reporting on the recent condition of Deputy Commander Zhang in the hospital: his body temperature and pulse are normal, his spirits are excellent, and he is able to receive foreign guests. The following are excerpts of two telegrams from Peiping: (1) To Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Greetings: Confidential. The Vice Commander was examined and treated in the hospital today. His body temperature and pulse are normal, his spirits are excellent, and he is able to receive foreign guests for a relatively short period of time. Please take note. Your brother, Wang Shuhan. (2) To Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Greetings: The Vice Commander was examined and treated in the hospital today. His body temperature and pulse are normal, his spirits are very good.

<p>Negotiations on the Scope of Authority are Currently Underway</p>
<p>Inspection Report to be Printed Soon</p>
<p>Admiral Du Xigui was ordered by the National Government to go to Europe, America, and Japan to inspect naval construction. After returning to China last autumn, he immediately began to organize his inspection report. Naval Minister Yang Shuzhuang recently obtained his consent and plans to appoint Du as the principal of the Mawei Naval Academy. Yesterday, this reporter interviewed Du at his private residence to inquire about the date of his assumption of office and future reorganization plans. According to Du, the Mawei Naval Academy has always been under the jurisdiction of the Naval Department, and all matters must be submitted to the Naval Department for handling. He is currently discussing the issue of the principal's authority with Minister Yang and Vice Minister Chen. If he can be given full authority without being restricted by the Naval Department, then he may be able to take on the position. Therefore, this matter is still under discussion. The Mawei Naval Academy is a specialized school, and students are sent by various provinces and recommended by naval officers' children. The scale is still large. In the future, after the Xiangshan military port is built, it may be moved there, which will make it easier to expand. The reporter also inquired whether the inspection report on the navies of various countries had been printed. He replied that the entire report is divided into twelve volumes and is still being printed. He is personally responsible for proofreading, and it will be published in about a month. A total of one thousand copies will be printed, which will be distributed to various agencies at that time.</p>

<p>The naval torpedo fleet, led by Commander Zeng Yiding, sailed to Xiangshan military port for exercises, firing torpedoes, practicing formations, and combat maneuvers for nearly a week. It was not until the day before yesterday that the exercises were completed. Commander Zeng immediately boarded the flagship Yongjian and led the team back to Shanghai, arriving at the Songkou port at about 3:30 PM yesterday. The flagship Yongjian led the way, followed by seven torpedo boats: Hupeng, Huzhun, Huzi, Chenzi, Suzi, Liezi, and Zhangzi, one after another, heading straight for Shanghai. When entering the port, the Wusong Fortress Naval Command and the National Coast Guard both raised flags and fired salutes to pay their respects. The torpedo fleet also returned the salute in accordance with the protocol. At about 6:00 PM, they sailed to Shanghai and are now gathered at the Gaoyangmiao port.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order yesterday from the Jiangsu Construction Department stating, "For implementation purposes, the Provincial Government's Order No. 3972 states: 'Approved is the Naval Department's Consultation No. 112, regarding the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea, which should be jointly observed by official steamships. The Ministry has previously reviewed it and attached the revised International Maritime Collision Avoidance Regulations for your reference.' Now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Consultation, according to the British Envoy's communication, states: 'As of now, there are not many countries that have expressed approval of the revised Collision Avoidance Regulations. It seems hopeless for all countries to implement them uniformly starting from July 1 of this year. Since most countries are not yet prepared for implementation as scheduled, we request that the Chinese government postpone the implementation date and handle it after setting another date in the future,' etc. In addition to sending Consultations separately, corresponding Consultations are sent for your examination and handling,' etc. Upon receiving this, in addition to issuing a general order, corresponding orders are issued for the County Magistrate to forward to the subordinate maritime administration agencies for unified notification.

<p>Guo Waifeng, a special commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has been burdened by the issuance of bonus promissory notes due to losses, causing numerous disputes and making it difficult to manage.

<p>The Number One Aircraft was also Damaged by Mongolian Soldiers</p>
<p>The Company is Negotiating for Rescue</p>
<p>Regarding the shooting down of the Number Two aircraft of the Eurasian Aviation Corporation on its northbound journey on the 2nd by foreign Mongolian troops, yesterday's newspaper had a brief report. A reporter from the Daily News visited Mr. Li Jingcong, the director of the company's operations group, again yesterday. According to Mr. Li, in addition to the damaged aircraft that was shot down, the Number One aircraft that went to investigate and rescue reported that it was also shot and injured. A rescue plan has now been discussed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Continuing Telegrams Received Yesterday <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The company received a continuing telegram yesterday from Jiang Da, director of the Manchurian branch office, and Liu Zhi, the pilot of Eurasian aircraft Number One, stating that while passing through the southeastern corner of Lake Buir, they saw with a telescope that Eurasian aircraft Number Two was parked on the east side of a nearby Mongolian village, with the fuselage intact, but the traces of the pilots Lai Qi and others had not been found. They also said that when they went to investigate on the 6th, they intended to land to inquire about the situation, but suddenly heard gunshots near the ground, violently shooting at the fuselage. As a result, they dared not stop and urgently flew to Manzhouli. After arriving at the Manzhouli airfield and inspecting the aircraft, they learned that the wings and fuel tanks were severely damaged. They immediately ordered a quick repair, and the aircraft left Manzhouli early this morning, taking the route through Linxi, and is expected to fly back to Peiping around noon today. Lake Buir is located about 240 kilometers south of Manzhouli and is under the jurisdiction of Hailar in this province. The southeastern side of the lake is the border between Hailar and Outer Mongolia. Since Outer Mongolia unilaterally declared independence, it seems that troops have been stationed in the area.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Reason for Crossing the Border <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li also told the reporter from the Daily News that the reason for the Number Three aircraft's mistaken entry into Outer Mongolia, in addition to what was reported in yesterday's newspaper, also had the following reasons. According to my (Mr. Li's self-proclaimed) speculation, the reasons are probably no more than the following: (1) Because the border area is very close to the route taken by the aircraft, it is easy to cross the border inadvertently. As for the reason for landing there, it must have been caused by being subjected to strong gunfire when it mistakenly entered the area.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Post-Accident Measures <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Currently, Director Jiang of the company's Manzhouli office has dispatched two people familiar with the situation in Outer Mongolia to investigate the message that the aircraft was seized, along with news of the aircraft fuel tank engine and more, if there were any injuries. Also, because Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia have good relations, he asked the Soviet Consul stationed in Manzhouli to find a way to negotiate and rescue the seized. It is hoped that the company's aircraft is of postal transport nature. They also have no military purpose. Because both trips to and from their flight have been for about two months, there is no intentional entry into the Outer Mongolian region that can be released. For safety reasons, is the company's aircraft still intended to take the straight flight between Linxi and Manzhouli after the misunderstanding has not been cleared and a solution has not been reached, and should the company evaluate and consult on this matter.</p>

As a result, the Chamber of Commerce asked the Municipal Government to handle the matter according to the Zhejiang Province model, exempting rice from business tax.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Dahua Hotel, a tall and beautiful archway was originally to be built at a cost of more than two thousand yuan. Later, Mr. Yu Qiaqing advocated for practical and beneficial actions and did not advocate for excessive extravagance, so the scope of the decoration was reduced. A stage is being built in the Dahua Garden, and colorful electric lights are being installed, which is quite busy.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Advice from British Women's Leaders on China's Anti-Opium Campaign <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Disguised Public Opium Trade is Inferior to the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Opium Taxation Violates the Treaty</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society has received hundreds of letters and telegrams from local party branches, anti-drug organizations, and mass organizations in recent days, expressing unanimous protests against the implementation of the disguised opium public sale by the Anti-Opium Prohibition and Investigation Office. It is reported that the Society received telegrams yesterday from American anti-drug leaders, Ms. Raymond, Mrs. Fred, and Mrs. Wright, expressing regret over the central government's anti-opium policy and urging the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society to actively protest and submit their true intentions to the State Council for adoption. Ms. Raymond is a well-known leader in the anti-drug movement with numerous works and a worldwide reputation. Mrs. Fred's new anti-drug novel (Conseceme) is praised by European and American opinion as the best work of humanitarian merit since Uncle Tom's Cabin. It has now been translated into Chinese by the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society under the name "Black Sea Retribution" and will be published soon. As for Mrs. Wright, she is the former director of the League of Nations' anti-opium division and the leader of the American delegation to the International Anti-Opium Conference, who recently toured the Far East and China. Her comments have always been valued by the world, and her claims are sufficient to influence the attitude of European and American opinion. Chinese people should be vigilant about such advice. It is reported that the American National Women's Alliance has also convened a meeting on this matter and will submit a protest soon. The translated version of Ms. Raymond's and others' opinions is as follows: (1) It is heard that the Chinese government is now establishing an opium public trade agency to manage and sell opium and to collect taxes from it to enrich the national treasury. (2) The result of spreading this news has greatly affected the opinion of all circles in the United States, which is most unfortunate. Under imperial rule, China was able to actively struggle to eradicate the planting of poppies, but the current National Government cannot exert the same force to protect the lives and happiness of the people. Is it not as good as a tyrannical government? The entire American people are deeply horrified. This kind of plan that is sufficient to diminish the prestige of the Chinese government in the international community is something that even the friendly nations of China believe is absolutely unacceptable. Moreover, the establishment of an opium public trade agency violates the 1912 Hague Opium Convention. The United States actively participated in this convention for the benefit of China.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(3) No friend of China is better than Bishop Brent. At the 1924 International Anti-Opium Conference, Bishop Brent expressed the view that the greatest event for us to help China is to lead the Chinese government to resist all temptations to establish an opium public trade agency. Some say that if we do not use this evil trade to collect huge profits, others will also take it. Or they think that a country that uses the exploitation of human weaknesses and sins as a source of revenue can become a glorious government. This flippant view is deeply distressing. (4) The argument that the establishment of opium public sales is a temporary expediency is theoretically unsound. There is no precedent for the cancellation of any public sale that has been established. (5) We hereby request your society to submit this matter to your country's State Council. (6) We hereby request that the State Council strictly enforce the anti-opium ban based on the following two principles: (A) Please use the spirit of an independent country to strictly prohibit the planting, transportation, trafficking, and smoking of opium in China. Move forward bravely without worrying about the obstacles of extraterritoriality and unequal treaties. (B) Please absolutely prohibit the implementation of national, provincial, county, town, and opium public sales or disguised public sales.</p>
<h3 id="e135">News from the Opium Suppression and Investigation Bureau <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The National Opium Prohibition Committee, based on resolutions from the National Assembly and the Fifth Plenary Session, regarding phased prohibition methods, and in accordance with Article 11 of the Implementing Rules for Opium Prohibition, has established Opium Suppression and Investigation Bureaus in each province, specifically responsible for investigating and suppressing the import, smuggling, and private consumption of opium and various substitute narcotics, in order to gradually achieve the goal of eradication. The director of the bureau for this province and Shanghai Municipality has already been appointed by the Opium Prohibition Committee to Mr. Feng Wenyu, as previously reported in this newspaper. Director Feng has a deep revolutionary history, having served as the director of salt affairs anti-smuggling bureaus in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces, where he earned a good reputation. After being appointed this time, he immediately established the investigation bureau at Xieqiao in this city, urging officials to work diligently. In recent days, they have cracked down on a significant number of cases involving the smuggling and concealment of opium and red pills. At important ports in other regions, water and land investigation posts have been established in accordance with regulations, specifically responsible for investigation and anti-smuggling duties. No specialized investigation commissioners have been established in each county. It is also heard that the bureau, in order to eliminate the poisonous atmosphere, intends to establish a smoking cessation hospital. Rumors outside about merchants contracting for sales, after multiple investigations, are known to be just rumors and not factual.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Merger of Stock Sections of the Exchange Considered Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Differences of opinion remain</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Ministries of Industry and Finance, considering that the prices of various bonds traded at the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange and the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange sometimes vary, and in order to maintain the stability of the bond market and reassure people, should merge the securities sections of the two exchanges ahead of schedule, and merge them into the Chinese Merchants Exchange within two months. This information has already been reported in the previous issue. A Guowen News Agency reporter obtained the following information yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Securities Held a Board Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After receiving instructions from the Ministries of Finance and Industry on the fourth of this month, the Securities and Goods Exchange immediately notified all directors to hold a board meeting at the exchange yesterday afternoon. All directors attended, chaired by Chairman Yu Qiaqing.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, the exchange supervisors Chen Xing and Xu Jianping scheduled a representative meeting at the supervisor's office at 5:00 PM yesterday, and Yu was appointed as the authorized representative to attend this meeting. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Representative Meeting of the Two Exchanges <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Exchange representative meeting was attended by securities representative Yu Qiaqing, Chinese Merchants representative Zhang Weiru, and the two supervisors Chen and Xu. The discussion lasted for several hours before adjourning. It is heard that the content seemed to be that the Securities Exchange wanted to cooperate equally with the Chinese Merchants Exchange, but the Chinese Merchants Exchange had not yet expressed agreement. As a result, the opinions of the two sides were not close.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Merger Problem Still Needs Time <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter inquired about opinions from various parties on this matter. Although the Ministries of Finance and Industry instructed that the securities sections of the two exchanges be merged within two months, the Securities Exchange is the oldest in the exchange and its credit has not been inferior to the Chinese Merchants Exchange recently, and its business has also made considerable progress. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is feared that the government's advance instruction to merge the securities sections of the two exchanges may not be completed as scheduled in reality.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs' collection of deck cargo tax from merchant ships has been unanimously opposed by Shanghai shipping merchants, who have petitioned the ministry for exemption. The ministry approved that they should consult with the Commissioner of Customs. Shipping bureaus held another meeting to discuss this matter. Since the Customs is determined to collect tax on deck cargo, there must be restrictions to avoid suffering for the shipping industry. The representatives agreed and elected Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Lüdeng, along with He Molin, Deputy Chief of Business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to go to the Customs to negotiate a fixed principle for the collection of deck tax per ton. Moreover, the shipping merchants proposed that deck tax be paid only by ships on the (1) Yangtze River line, (2) Shanghai-Ningbo line, (3) Tongyang line, (4) Shanghai-Taiwan line, (5) Shanghai-Shasha line, and (6) Shanghai-Chongming line. Ships on other ocean routes will not pay. The tax rate will be one fen of silver per ton as determined by the Customs. The three representatives still need to discuss with the Commissioner of Customs.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Maritime Affairs Administration, according to Article 62 of the Ship Registration Law, merchant ships should pay a registration fee. Shipping bureaus have held multiple meetings on this matter and have petitioned the ministry for exemption. Now, they have put forward a resolution: Chinese merchant ships have all been registered with the Ministry of Communications and issued certificates, and the customs have registered and issued licenses. If the Maritime Affairs Administration orders the payment of huge registration fees again, it would be redundant and the government orders would be repetitive, which would be too much to bear. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Communications to approve free registration for all ships that have already been registered and licensed with the Ministry and registered and licensed with the Customs to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, each shipping bureau will respectfully report to the Maritime Affairs Administration for registration, but will not pay fees and will eliminate redundancy.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Resolution of Labor Dispute at Ruirong Iron Factory <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>All Hourly Workers Given Severance Pay and Dismissed</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Ruirong Iron Factory on Yangshupu Road, due to business reasons, starting in June, transferred 48 workers, including Chen Qingsheng, to work in shifts, working three days a week. All the workers believed that this was proposed by the foreman Zhang Wende, so they clashed with the foreman, resulting in Zhang being injured. The foreman Smith dismissed all the hourly workers. The labor union sent personnel to negotiate, but with no results. They petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for assistance. The bureau sent personnel to mediate twice. The labor side demanded reinstatement, otherwise, they would receive severance pay equivalent to twelve weeks' wages, like the regular workers. The employer insisted on not reinstating them and only agreed to give each person severance pay for twelve days. Therefore, it has been more than a month now and it is still impossible to resolve the matter. The workers went to the authorities to petition the day before yesterday. In order to avoid escalating the labor dispute, the bureau convened a labor-management mediation meeting again yesterday afternoon. The factory foreman Smith and worker representatives Du Zhongwen and Chen Qingsheng, Chairman Gu Bingyuan, and recorder Jiang Shifu attended. The two sides argued fiercely. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, a resolution was reached and a contract was signed as follows: (1) The employment relationship between the 48 hourly workers, including Du Zhongwen and Chen Qingsheng, and the Ruirong Iron Factory is terminated. (2) The factory will give each worker six weeks' wages as severance pay.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Extremely Severe Disaster Situation in Henan <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a telegram from Commissioner Li Huanying of the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Committee: "Respectful greetings to Mr. Wang Peiyuan of the Chinese Red Cross Society. Tanghe is unfortunate, having suffered repeated disasters. Since the founding of the Republic, the city has been broken eight times, and the people have suffered terribly. The vitality has not yet recovered. In the past three years, it has been broken once a year. Last year, the Communists occupied the city, burning, killing, and looting, which was already extremely cruel. Unexpectedly, before they could catch their breath, at dawn on May 30, the city was captured by the giant bandit Cui Erdan. It was found that the bandit occupied the city for twenty days, sending teams out every day to attack towns and loot villages, arbitrarily kidnapping. Within fifty miles around, the residents fled. There is no one. It is the time when the two wheats are ripe.</p>
<p>Scorched on the ground, no one to harvest. According to refugees who escaped and people from Huanying's family who came to Bian to report, they wept uncontrollably and said: "Two or three thousand people were killed in the city, and more than ten thousand were dragged away. Eighty or ninety percent of the houses were destroyed. Even worse, women were forced to be raped, and children were thrown to their deaths. The bandits gathered to watch and took it as pleasure. They also took advantage of the two wheats being scorched to set fire and burn, extending to the fields and wilds to celebrate. All kinds of tragic situations are unbearable to describe. It is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. Huanying is a fellow villager and feels the pain deeply. He longs for his hometown, but cannot return. The livelihood of hundreds of thousands of victims is currently hopeless, and the autumn harvest in the future is uncertain. Cries of starvation are everywhere. I respectfully appeal, and sincerely hope that you will be mindful of the enormity of the bandit disaster in Tanghe this time, and devise special methods to raise a large sum of disaster relief funds and immediately provide relief. The 300,000 lives in the county will all feel your great kindness forever. I send this urgent telegram with a hundred bows, without appointment, and earnestly pray." Li Huanying of the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, gratefully kowtowing.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Scheduled Dredging of Wharves in Southern Shanghai <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Construction to begin on July 14</p>
<p>After taking over the wharves in southern Shanghai, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau immediately submitted a request to the Municipal Government to carry out dredging projects to facilitate berthing. The Municipal Government ordered the Public Works Bureau and the Huangpu Dredging Bureau to discuss handling the matter. Due to the price issue, discussions took a long time. Recently, Director Song of the Huangpu Dredging Bureau and Mayor Zhang agreed that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau would pay 50,000 yuan to handle the dredging project for wharves No. 1 to No. 16 in southern Shanghai. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 14th of this month. It is heard that the Public Utilities Bureau has sent a letter to the Shipping Association, asking them to convey to the shipping companies renting the wharves that during the dredging period, they must follow the ship-stopping measures agreed upon at the bureau last time, so as not to hinder the progress of the project.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Appeal for Flood Relief in Jiangxi <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee received a telegram from the New Construction Flood Relief Aftermath Committee yesterday: "Jiangxi is in a state of devastation. Bandit disasters have not subsided, and flood disasters have been added. It is early summer, and the massive floods are overwhelming. Hurricanes have taken advantage of this to collapse embankments and uproot houses. Fields and gardens are flooded, and families are displaced. Every household has suffered. The situation is extremely tragic. The province has already sent telegrams, which you are presumed to be aware of. However, our New Construction County is located in the middle of the Gan River and is close to the western Wen of Poyang Lake. The terrain is low-lying and the disaster is particularly severe. In the past, the upstream water burst and many embankments collapsed. Afterwards, the downstream water suddenly rose, and the accumulation has no way to dissipate. Now, it has been more than two months, and the river water is a vast expanse. The people are sick and dying, which is heartbreaking to see. The early rice sowing has already been delayed, and the late rice harvest will be hopeless. In a county that is known for its poverty, and in the face of this extraordinarily tragic disaster, alas, the people, how can we save the dead? This is why we must hope that the charitable people of the world will show special pity." It is heard that the Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee has already prepared 10,000 yuan to help with emergency relief. However, the summer days are long, the disaster area is expanding, and there are cries of starvation everywhere. Without a large sum of disaster relief funds, how can we help? We earnestly hope that all sectors of society will show great compassion and actively provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Rice Boat Capsized, Crew Drowned <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Three Dead</p>
<p>The rice boat Tao Kangting recently collected more than 190 shih of white rice from farmers in Zhangjin area of Songjiang and transported it to Shanghai for sale. On the morning of the sixth, before dawn, there was heavy rain and a very rough sea. Tao's boat anchored by the Dujia Hang riverbank in Nanhuangpu. Tao and his crew were all fast asleep. Unexpectedly, the rain was even heavier and the waves were even more violent. The iron anchor chain broke and the boat was washed away by the waves. The iron feet on board were very heavy, and the rainwater inside the boat made it even heavier. Suddenly, a gust of wind and waves caused the whole boat to sink. Tao and his crew were all asleep at the time. They were startled by the water flooding the cabin. The boat was gradually sinking. Tao and one of the crew rushed out of the cabin, their bodies already wet. The other three crew members did not have time to climb out and drowned in the boat. In a hurry, Tao threw a cabin plank into the river, clung to it, and drifted to Luya, where he was rescued by a cargo ship. One of Tao's crew members grabbed onto the main mast and called for help. Later, he was rescued by a small boat from Jiangbei. Yesterday, he hired a boat to go to the scene of the accident. When the tide receded, they saw the boat exposed above the water. They hired craftsmen to go down into the cabin and tie up the three crew members who had drowned and lift them up. They moved the corpses to the shore for purchase of coffins and burial. Now, they are hiring machinery to try to salvage the boat, but it will cost a lot. Tao is very frustrated because all his belongings were on the boat and he suffered this misfortune.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Bagao Advertising Company Undergoes Major Reorganization <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Working Together with Rickshaw Companies</p>
<p>Bagao Advertising Company, located at 36 Renji Road, pioneered advertising on rickshaw hoods, creating a unique and novel approach that caused quite a sensation in Shanghai. It was hailed as one of the most innovative developments in the advertising industry. However, due to its initial rudimentary nature, it was not perfect. Subsequently, it underwent repeated reforms, consuming countless efforts and financial resources. It was changed to sheet metal advertisements, resembling miniature versions of street signs in the market, printed with colorful oil paints, beautiful, bright, and exceptionally eye-catching. However, the costs were too high, and the procedures were cumbersome, making it uneconomical for advertising clients. Now, to facilitate client advertising and reduce their burden, it has been changed to multi-colored finely printed posters pasted on the sheet metal. Its effectiveness far surpasses that of advertisements on trams and public buses. Rickshaws travel to every corner of the city, reaching all social classes, who enjoy using them for transportation. The advertisements on their hoods are constantly in view, deeply imprinted in people's minds. Moreover, the cost can be reduced by half, and advertising rates are also particularly low. Those interested in placing such advertisements are requested to call 12919 to inquire about prices and learn everything. Yesterday, several vehicles had already pasted these advertisements, and those who saw them were quite amazed, believing that rickshaw advertising, after its reforms, has reached a flawless stage, attracting exceptional attention.</p>

<p>Da Shijie Placed with Huang Jinrong</p>
<p>Investigating a Jadeite Worth 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Two Accountants Request Payment of Public Expenses</p>
<p>Huang's Family Members Request Living Expenses</p>
<p>Shanghai Riyue Bank and Da Shijie Amusement Deposit Department declared bankruptcy after the death of Huang Chu Jiu. The French Concession Court repeatedly summoned witnesses and engaged accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Cheng to liquidate the assets and distribute one-tenth of the recovered funds to creditors. These events have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the French Concession Court summoned witnesses again. Accountant Pan Zhaobang stated that an agreement had been reached with Mr. Huang Jinrong regarding the sale of Da Shijie for 700,000 yuan. A contract had been signed and submitted for review. The payment is expected to be made around the end of July. Furthermore, Mr. Huang acknowledged and agreed to pay the monthly rent of 10,000 yuan for July in full. In addition, the accountants discovered during the inventory of Huang Chu Jiu's estate that Huang Chu Jiu possessed a jadeite worth 100,000 yuan, weighing 320 jin, which was entrusted to Liu Baogeng for washing and cutting. Liu has now been brought to court and is requested to hand it over. Liu Baogeng, represented by lawyer Lin Yingqing, stated that in April or May of last year, Huang Chu Jiu purchased two jadeite stones from Yunnan merchant Chen Kaiqing, totaling 600 jin, one weighing 280 jin and one weighing 320 jin, for 30,000 yuan. The 320-jin jadeite was discussed with Liu Baogeng, who was to transport it to Beiping for washing and cutting, with the condition that Liu would contribute 30% of the shares and be responsible for paying the processing fees. Future profits would be evenly distributed. At that time, Liu Baogeng consulted with colleagues Ma Yurong and Lu Junren, who deemed the goods reliable. An agreement was reached, and they successively paid 4,800 yuan, of which 3,900 yuan was paid with three checks from Riyue Bank, and 900 yuan was paid in cash. Yizhengrong Jade Workshop is currently washing and cutting the jadeite. All of this can be verified with the original goods, handling personnel, and accounts. It is actually co-owned by Liu Baogeng and Huang Chu Jiu and cannot be considered Huang's private property. This is the true situation. Subsequently, creditor representatives Yan Luqing and Bian Jialu, both lawyers, stated that according to Liu Baogeng's representative lawyer, Liu also has a 30% interest in the jadeite and must provide concrete evidence, otherwise, they deny it. They requested that Liu Baogeng be required to provide 100,000 yuan in silver and security and be given a deadline to hand over the jadeite. Liu's representative lawyer, Lin Yingqing, stated that all of Liu Baogeng's statements are true. Check stubs are available for verification. If Liu Baogeng were not honest, he could simply deny everything. Moreover, Liu has substantial property in the jurisdiction and does not need to provide security. The court ordered the jadeite to be handed over to the court within 21 days. Furthermore, lawyer Peng Qi stated that his lawyer represents Wanchun Silver Group and that all public expenses should be calculated at 3%, totaling 9,000 yuan. His lawyer is now offering a reduction to 4,500 yuan and requests that it be allocated from Huang's estate. The court ruled to allocate 3,000 yuan and allow it to be deducted from Huang's estate. Accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Cheng stated that they also request that all public expenses be assessed according to the public association's regulations. Lawyer Dong Yu stated that regarding the public expenses requested by Pan and Wu, they have worked hard since taking over the liquidation and their request for public expenses is appropriate. His lawyer does not object. The court ruled to wait for further review. It is heard that Huang's family members are requesting living expenses. Their representative lawyer, Tan Yigong, has sent a letter to all creditors, scheduling a meeting today to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Kidnapping or Compensation? <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>For a Mere 16 Yuan?</p>
<p>Criminals Would Not Likely Open Fire</p>
<p>Calling It Kidnapping Seems Unlikely</p>
<p>At 9:40 PM last night, a confusing incident that resembled but was not quite a kidnapping occurred at number 100, Caishi Road, in the French Concession. The criminals even opened fire to resist arrest. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e179">Recent Relocation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Two days ago, Futai Paint Shop, located near the Caishi Market at number 100, Caishi Road in the French Concession, rented out a vacant three-story building. A Taizhou man named Wang Hezheng rented the building and moved in with his family. Besides Wang himself, the family includes Wang's wife, Ms. Bao, his mother-in-law, his brothers-in-law Guangde and Guangrong, Wang's eldest son Gonghan, and his second daughter Heyu, totaling seven people.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Screaming Kidnapping <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Around 9:30 PM last night, four burly men suddenly arrived, went straight to the third floor of number 100, and entered the Wang family's room. At that time, Wang had just returned home. Upon seeing Wang inside, the men immediately showed anger and ordered Wang to come downstairs. Wang, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately refused. The men did not allow any explanation and forcibly dragged Wang downstairs and escorted him away. Wang's family immediately leaned over the railing and screamed "Kidnapping!"</p>
<h3 id="e181">Second Outcry <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>At that time, Hua Constable Liu Delin from Shandong, number 630, was on duty near the Caishi Market. He heard the alarm and rushed to investigate. The screams quickly subsided. The constable saw no one reporting and immediately returned to his post. At the same time, a Vietnamese constable from Sandao Tou passed by on patrol and asked the constable to sign the logbook. No sooner had he finished signing than the cry for help arose again.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Both Sides Open Fire <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Upon hearing this, Constable Liu returned and saw an old woman holding onto a man, claiming that the man was a lookout for the criminals. When the man saw the constable approaching, he suddenly broke free, sprinted towards the alley entrance across the street, and fled. Constable Liu pursued him. Just as he entered the alley, a gunshot was heard. Constable Liu also drew his gun and fired. As he rounded the corner, another shot was fired, and a pellet hit the ground, covering Constable Liu's face with dust.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Taken to a Teahouse <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Seeing two shots in rapid succession, Constable Liu also fired three shots in return. Unfortunately, the fourth bullet was stuck inside the chamber and could not fire, so he did not dare to pursue further and returned to report to the police station. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives Mao Jingen and others to investigate. However, Wang Hezheng was nowhere to be found. At the same time, a passerby secretly reported that the criminals had taken Wang to Tianle Teahouse at number 138, Tiantai Road. Detective Mao immediately led the detectives to surround and capture them.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Debt Dispute <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Upon arriving at Tianle Teahouse, the hall was empty. He inquired with the owner of the teahouse, who stated that a moment ago, three or five people had brought a man from Taizhou to drink tea. He vaguely heard that the Taizhou man owed someone 16 yuan and had not paid it for a long time. Tonight, they had gathered a group of people to seek revenge, leading to the misunderstanding of a kidnapping. However, until late at night, Wang Hezheng was still nowhere to be found. Moreover, if it was truly to collect a mere 16 yuan, it was absolutely unnecessary to gather a gang, carry weapons, and open fire to resist arrest. If it was truly a kidnapping, why bring Wang to a teahouse? It is truly perplexing. The police station has ordered detectives to thoroughly investigate and uncover the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Strange Dead Child <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Two Heads, One Body with Eight Limbs</p>
<p>Around 11 AM yesterday, on a grave mound behind the Jiayu Hall on Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei, someone discarded the corpse of a newborn child. It had two heads, four legs, and four arms. It was born inside a single sac. It also had two small penises. They were two male fetuses. It appeared to have been a difficult birth, as if a doctor had performed a cesarean section to extract it. The ears, eyes, mouth, and nose were all complete. However, one child had a cleft lip, commonly known as a harelip. For a time, the event spread far and wide as a strange occurrence, and many people flocked to see it. Later, someone reported it to the Pushan Villa, which sent earthworkers to collect and bury it in a wooden box.</p>

<p>Defendant's Request for Dismissal Rejected</p>
<p>After the death of Xue Baorun, a major paint merchant, his wife and son allegedly seized the inheritance of the first and second wives. Baorun's nephew, a lawyer, filed a separate civil lawsuit against the third wife in the Special District Court. This has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. At the previous hearing, the defendant, Xue Longsheng, requested the court to dismiss the lawsuit assistance granted to the plaintiff, the eldest and second wives, in the hope that the case could be settled in one hearing. The lawyers for both sides debated fiercely. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyers, Lu Xieji and Wu Chengyu, submitted additional reasons and stated their objections. The court has ruled on the matter and rejected the defendant's request. Further hearings will be held soon.</p>

<h3 id="e190">French Concession Municipal Council Procures Large Number of Trash Cans <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>To Be Distributed Per Household, One Each</p>
<p>The Sanitation Department of the French Concession Municipal Council is actively improving facilities to address the sanitation issues of citizens. Regarding the use of trash cans by citizens and residents, the board of directors has previously approved the Sanitation Department to procure hundreds of trash cans to be distributed to citizens for their use. It is heard that each trash can costs four yuan, which must be paid by the recipient. However, it is heard that while the Municipal Council's intention to care for residents by promoting sanitation and providing trash cans is good, the distribution per household may be compulsory, which may cause dissatisfaction among citizens. Therefore, the Municipal Council will soon issue a notice restating the reasons for preparing trash cans and the methods for citizens to use them, in order to avoid misunderstandings among Chinese and foreign citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Discussion on the Shanghai Datong Music Society's Invention of New Musical Notation <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Datong Music Society completed the manufacture of 163 ancient and modern, elegant and popular musical instruments (now housed at the World College), Zheng Jinwen, the director of the society, personally tested each instrument and found them to have considerable value. These musical instruments are divided into 13 major categories: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, wood, clay flute, reed pipe, leather, horsehair, and shell. They have natural scales, four-tone scales, seven-tone scales, nine-palace scales, twelve-tone scales, sixteen-character scales, and small-one-tone (i.e., 24-tone) scales, totaling eight types. Now, to carry out the second step of work, it is truly necessary to create new notation. After five months of examination, the old gongche notation and other notations were found to be inapplicable. Therefore, the five-line staff has been expanded to a seven-line staff, changing the seven-tone nature to a twelve-tone nature. Short lines are added above and below the center line of the high and low sections (a total of three lines). The second line is used as the tonic, totaling seven used notes and five rest notes as one step. If a line is used, the space is a rest; if a space is used, the line is a rest. The key signature only needs to draw an S between the third and fourth used notes for identification. All keys can be inferred from this, which can save a lot of trouble with sharp and flat signs. Chinese music emphasizes fingering the most. The old notation details the fingering and neglects the rhythm. The five-line staff details the rhythm but is difficult to fill in the fingering. However, the seven-line staff method can compensate for both. Furthermore, by distinguishing the shape of the notes with squares, circles, large, and small sizes, the live, fixed, light, and heavy aspects of the music can be expressed. Thus, any music can be recorded without omission. Mr. Zheng has already compiled a zither score and a pipa score using this method and handed them over to the core members of the society, such as Liu Wei and others, for thorough study to achieve perfection. In the future, they will be printed into a volume for musicians around the world to adopt.</p>

<p>Recently, since the Zhujing Wang family murder case occurred, various institutions and entertainment venues in this city have been competing to opportunistically stage plays based on the case. The Education Bureau of this city believes that this case is related to public morals, and performing it on various stages is tantamount to promoting lewdness and murder, which has a significant impact. The Tianchan Stage, Guang Stage, Small World, Tianyun Building, Xinxin Amusement Park, and several other theaters that have adapted and performed plays based on the case have been severely ordered to stop performing, and notices have been sent to various newspapers to remove all advertisements related to the plays.</p>

<p>The case of the Nisshin Masaru, belonging to the Dalian Branch of the Nisshin Company, violently sinking the Shaoxing junk Xu Huiyuan, loaded with glass, at Renjiagang Port in Nantong on April 10th, has been under negotiation for over two months.

<p>After receiving the petition from the victim Xu Huiyuan, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in addition to forwarding it as appropriate, immediately replied in a letter stating: "Regarding the Xu Huiyuan junk sunk by the Nisshin Masaru, a black-hulled steamship of the Dalian Steamship Company, we received your association's telegram and immediately submitted it to the Ministry for handling, and also replied accordingly. Now, we have received Instruction No. 3427 from the Ministry, which states, 'All submitted documents are noted. Regarding the loss of the Xu Huiyuan cargo ship, we have requested the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to instruct the Dalian Steamship Company to be responsible for compensation. Please be informed accordingly.' Upon receiving this, we hereby inform you, hoping you will investigate and inform the relevant parties. Respectfully addressed to the Zhejiang Shipping Association in Shanghai."</p>

<p>This case has been ongoing for several months. The plaintiff, due to significant losses and disruption of livelihood, has requested various organizations such as the Zhejiang Shipping Association in Shanghai and the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association to speak out for justice and provide assistance. Yesterday, the Shipping Association specifically sent Mr. Xu Huarun to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about everything. At the same time, he personally went to the Dalian Company for negotiation, but the Dalian Company still made excuses, claiming that the blame lay with the civilian ship for not having lights. However, according to the proof from the local water police department, the ship was sailing alongside and has submitted evidence documents for the Ministry to review.</p>

<p>The evidence copied by the Second Team of the Renjiagang Water Police is as follows. The original text of the signed note by the captain and river pilot of the Nisshin Masaru, copied by the Second Sub-Team of the Water Police: "Around 8 PM on April 10th, the Nisshin Masaru of the Dalian Company, passing outside Renjiagang Port in Nantong, rammed and sank a Shaoxing civilian ship named Xu Huiyuan. It has been confirmed by Inspector Long Yuhang, No. 5 of the 16th Team of the Renjiagang Water Police. Because the Nisshin Masaru wanted to return to Shanghai after unloading coal at Tianshenggang, the responsibility and how to resolve it in the future will be negotiated after both parties arrive in Shanghai." Signed by Captain Yoshida Sadao of the Nisshin Masaru, River Pilot Li Guangyin, Representative Xu Gang of the Zhejiang Shipping Association, and Inspector Long Yuhang of the Renjiagang Water Police. These three official documents are stored at the Second Sub-Team headquarters in Renjiagang.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Case of Forging the Ju'an Sugar Company Seal <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Complex Case</p>
<p>Summoning Records for Re-Examination</p>
<p>Zhang Songzhou, a comprador from Guangdong at the Datong Bank on Jiangxi Road, was recently accused of forgery in the Special District Court by Guo Shuopeng, the owner of the Ju'an Sugar Company on Yangxing Street in the French Concession. The plaintiff's complaint states: "The plaintiff has never guaranteed any monetary debts for anyone. Suddenly, on February 9th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff received a letter from Datong Bank stating that the Ju'an Company, which the plaintiff established, had guaranteed eight batches of foreign exchange advances for the Tongde Company. Hearing this, the plaintiff was extremely surprised and immediately asked a friend, Chen Weiqing, to inquire. He saw ten orders bearing the wooden chop of Guo Ju'an. At that time, the wooden chop did not have any words indicating responsibility. On March 13th, the plaintiff asked lawyer He Shimai to accompany his friend Weng Huidong to inquire at the bank. The bank manager presented a large order but only allowed lawyer He to view it from a distance. Lawyer He immediately denied it on the spot. On March 18th, Datong commissioned lawyer Xu Li to send a letter, demanding that the plaintiff assume responsibility and claiming 20,000 taels. On April 4th, the plaintiff asked a lawyer to reply, denying the guarantee. On June 15th, the plaintiff sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to Zhang Songzhou, a comprador at Datong Bank, to quickly bring the forged order to the General Chamber of Commerce to verify who forged it for prosecution purposes. Zhang Songzhou replied to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that he intended to file a lawsuit with the court and could not bring it. The plaintiff waited quietly for Datong to file a lawsuit, but it did not proceed for a year. In the middle, Mr. Ke Wendi, a foreign manager from the Mei Yong Petroleum Company, sent a letter, urging the plaintiff to reconcile with Datong, otherwise, he would testify in court, proving that the plaintiff was the organizer of Tongde, etc. Compelled, on May 10th of the 18th year, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the civil court against Zhang Songzhou for forging the order, requesting cancellation. Datong Bank, knowing that the plaintiff had filed a lawsuit, filed another case on May 15th, claiming that the plaintiff was a shareholder of Tongde and that Ju'an was the guarantor, requesting the performance of the guarantee contract. The original claim was for 62,531 taels, but this case astonishingly ruled that the plaintiff should pay over 66,370 taels. Currently, Datong's lawsuit requesting the plaintiff to perform the guarantee contract has been suspended in the appellate court. The plaintiff's lawsuit against Zhang Songzhou for forging the order has been ordered to be prosecuted in the criminal court," etc. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide interrogated the case in the Second Criminal Court. First, the defendant's lawyer stated, "The case is complex. The litigation has been ongoing for four years since the 16th year. The previous testimonies of both the plaintiff and the defendant are on record. However, for clarity, it is necessary to retrieve and consult the previous testimonies. Therefore, we request the court to postpone the hearing." Next, Guo Shuopeng testified, "The defendant forged twelve guarantee contracts. The strokes of the seals are different in thickness. Furthermore, the company's silver and money transactions require my signature after the seal is affixed for them to be valid. However, there are no signature traces at all." The defendant claimed, "Guo Bohan, the plaintiff's son, jointly established the Tongde Company with Lin Bangji and Lin Yingjie. Guo's son was the manager, and the plaintiff was a major shareholder. The company previously mortgaged US$200,000 of goods to the Mei Yong Petroleum Company. However, due to insufficient capital, Guo Shuopeng's sugar company acted as the guarantor. There were a total of twelve guarantee contracts. This time, in addition to the goods, the Petroleum Company also lost US$20,000, so they are seeking compensation." The plaintiff replied, "Guo Bohan is my son, but we have separated and are now living separately. I do not know where he is now." The judge then instructed that the case be adjourned for further hearing after all relevant case files are gathered.</p>

<p>Su Jiashan, a prominent merchant from Changshu residing in Shanghai, was highly respected for his silk business in Xichang and other places. Throughout his life, he enjoyed doing good deeds and providing financial assistance to various charitable organizations in Shanghai. He also independently established a charitable hospital in Changshu, founded a free school, and constructed roads, among other public-spirited endeavors, which were praised by his fellow villagers. Recently, he unfortunately passed away yesterday due to illness. Upon hearing the news, relatives and friends were all grieved. The funeral is scheduled for 1:00 PM tomorrow, followed by the burial at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Jingwei Company Disputes Labor Arbitration, Involved in Lawsuit <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jingwei Company in Huaxingfang, Baoding Road, previously dismissed ten workers, Xu Xilin, Yu A'ye, Shen Fei'an, Wang Zhongrui, Qian Zhangnan, Song Qiwen, Shi Hegen, He A'lin, He A'shi, and Pan Yingzhou, due to poor performance and obvious misconduct. However, Xu and the others believed that the company's dismissal was quite unreasonable. Therefore, they applied to the Shanghai Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee to summon both parties for arbitration. Subsequently, the committee ruled that Jingwei Company's dismissal of Xu Xilin and others was inappropriate and ordered reinstatement. Jingwei Company disagreed and raised an objection. On one hand, they hired lawyer Hong Shihao to submit a petition to the mediation office of the Special District Court, requesting mediation, modification of the original ruling, and rejection of the workers' demands. The reason given was that Xu and the others were originally on probation. Formal employment would only occur if the probation was satisfactory. However, after Xu and the others entered the factory, their misconduct was obvious, making dismissal unavoidable. Unexpectedly, the Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee failed to investigate and ordered reinstatement, which was unreasonable in theory and too restrictive in practice. Therefore, they legally requested mediation, modification of the original ruling. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong held a hearing for mediation. On the workers' side, lawyer Huang Xiubo attended the court. Judge Xu immediately declared that labor disputes could only be litigated after arbitration and that mediation was unnecessary. There was a ministerial order explaining this. Why was the plaintiff requesting mediation? According to lawyer Hong, Jingwei Company did not want labor and capital to reach extremes, so they requested mediation to seek a peaceful resolution. Lawyer Huang immediately stated that arbitration rulings could only be enforced by the court. Jingwei Company's request for mediation was unprecedented. Judge Xu then asked lawyer Hong for mediation opinions. The reply was that Jingwei Company intended to allow those who had not received wages to collect them at the company and then terminate the labor contract. Lawyer Huang immediately objected, saying that five of the ten workers, Xu Xilin, etc., could be expected to be reinstated. If the remaining five were not reinstated, Jingwei Company would have to pay double the wages according to the length of service. For example, if they had worked for one year, they would be paid another year's salary. Lawyer Hong indicated that he needed to seek the company's opinion and requested an extension. Lawyer Huang also agreed. Judge Xu then ordered a postponement for further review.</p>

<p>Fu Aqing, a man from Shaoxing in his forties, lived at No. 6, Zhongxing Lane, Zhongxing Road. His wife, Fu Yang, was just past her youthful years. They were incompatible, so she often glared at her husband. Fu sought peace and did not understand his wife's intentions, as she had already become involved with Wang Youjin, who ran a firewood shop on Hanzhong Road. She planned to provoke Fu into divorce. However, Fu's pitiful appearance caused neighbors to feel sorry for him. They told him the details and offered help. Fu suddenly gained courage. At 4 PM the day before yesterday, the illicit lovers were in a secret rendezvous. The neighbors informed Fu, who helped to capture them at the scene and called the police, who took them to the Fourth District Police Station. Yesterday, they were handed over to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>In the case of the Guangdong merchant Li Jiyun from Shanghai who went to Hangzhou for medical treatment last year and was kidnapped and murdered by bandits in Longjing, after the detectives were instructed to arrest Wang Yang and Wang E (who were also major bank robbery offenders) and other bandits in Shanghai and escort them to Hangzhou for trial, there was still a remaining accomplice, Wang Sizhen, also known as Wang Kehua, who was at large and had not been apprehended for a long time. Recently, at the beginning of this month, detectives from the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau discovered that the bandit was hiding in the French Concession. They followed him and arrested the bandit Wang Sizhen. Yesterday, the detective chief Feng Yangxian of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau escorted the bandit back to Hangzhou for interrogation. It is reported that the family members of the victim Li received the news and rushed to Hangzhou yesterday morning to await interrogation.</p>

Yesterday, the cargo owner sent a letter to the bureau, requesting that the goods be returned promptly to avoid losses. At the same time, they requested that the thieves be severely punished and that more attention be paid to merchants' goods in the future to prevent such incidents from happening again.</p>

<p>The Oriental Baidai Company, located at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Renji Road, is a large-scale record company in Shanghai. It has its own factory in Xujiahui, making record production particularly convenient. Recently, it hired a famous British engineer to research and improve the quality of all previously released records, making them more durable and clearer. The four-and-a-half-minute records that have been rumored for months have been delayed due to the company's cautious consideration. Fearing that supply would not meet demand after their release, the factory has been ordered to increase production. At the latest, the records will be released within half a month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association held its 37th executive committee meeting yesterday. Agenda items: (1) How to handle the implementation of public scales and the determination of coal weight for members. It was resolved that coal stored in a yard before July 1 should still be calculated in English tons. If using metric tons, it should be calculated according to English tons. From July 1, all calculations should be based on metric tons (1 English ton = 2240 pounds, 1 metric ton = 2204.6 pounds). (2) For coal sales contracts between members and foreign firms or miners that do not specify public scales, the weight should be calculated according to English pounds. If delivered according to public scales, 35.4 pounds per ton should be added to the English pounds or deducted from the original price. (3) Members should use public scales for all coal sales and notify users accordingly. (4) Anti-opium public sale proposal. It was resolved that the secretary should draft a declaration expressing opposition. (5) How to resist the Japanese instigation of Koreans to boycott Chinese businesses. It was resolved: (1) Request the government to send warships to protect overseas Chinese. (2) Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations. If still ineffective, adopt a non-cooperation policy towards Japanese residing in China and order Koreans to leave.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor-in-Chief of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Greetings. Regarding the news item "Thief Steals Guanyin" in the local news section of the fourth page of your newspaper on July 8th, it states that "Maotai Foreign Firm had a batch of Chinese antique porcelain shipped overseas for a good price." However, our firm does not engage in buying and selling imports and exports, but specializes in transshipment, customs declaration, warehousing, insurance, and also operates the Huangpu Ferry Bureau and Shanghai Handling Company. Therefore, the porcelain shipped overseas this time did not belong to our firm. Our firm only acted as a customs broker and transporter for the client. Because the information in your newspaper is slightly inaccurate, we are writing to request a correction to clarify the truth and responsibility. We earnestly pray for this. Respectfully, Maotai Foreign Firm, July 8th.</p>

<p>Love, clothing, courtesy, and conversation. All were invented by women. The more women invent, the heavier the burden on men.</p>
<p>If there were no women in this world, there would be no vanity. We men could revert to our primitive state, using animal skins for winter and leaves for summer. We would absolutely not need clothes.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve. One day in the garden, they saw an apple. Adam hadn't even touched it, but Eve took it and ate it first. So sin is also something invented by women.</p>
<p>No young man loves to look at the moon on a spring night unless he is caught in the web of love and suffering some pain.</p>
<p>Those who swim well often drown. Those who are passionate often get misled by love.</p>
<p>The difference between an engagement ring and a wedding ring is like the difference between a promissory note and a bank draft.</p>
<p>An educated person is the laziest person in the world. He refuses to work and only spends his time reading.</p>

<h3 id="e212">A New Crime Trend Spreading from North to South <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Crime also has trends. For example, kidnapping for ransom is called "grabbing tickets." Previously, it rarely happened in the Jiangnan region. Since Sun Meiyao cut off the road in Lincheng and kidnapped foreigners to demand official positions, the trend of kidnapping has become prevalent. It spreads gradually from north to south and is rampant in Shanghai. This is one trend of crime. Another example is tomb raiding. Since the Eastern Mausoleums were excavated, resulting in a large collection of rare treasures, the petty thieves of Peiping have also followed suit and become a trend. Peiping originally had many noble graves, all of which were successively robbed. Even the tomb of the actor Tan Xinpei was not spared, showing how rampant it is. Now, this trend is also gradually spreading south, and will be as prevalent as the kidnapping trend. Wu County has a Song Dynasty scholar named Zhu Changwen. His tomb was also dug up and suffered the tragedy of having his remains split apart, which is heartbreaking. The matter concerns the destruction of the relics of famous scholars and has an impact on morality and people's hearts. It is different from the excavation of ordinary people's tombs. Zhu served as a proofreader in the Secretariat during the Song Dynasty. He was knowledgeable and studious. He was gentle and did not seek advancement. He built a Happy Garden in the city and read books there, which is now the old Happy Garden Academy, one of the famous sites in Wucheng. In his later years, he taught in this Prefecture and was promoted to Doctor of the Imperial Academy. He taught people to study classics first and then literature. Throughout his life, he wrote books that were either transmitted or not. The table of contents of his books is fully recorded in the History of the Song Dynasty. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong allocated funds to repair the Happy Garden. Later, Jiangsu Education Commissioner Li Yinpei requested to promote famous scholars, with Zhu listed first. He was admired by later generations in this way. Unexpectedly, under the blue and white flag, his tomb was reported to have been robbed, which is regrettable. It is hoped that the authorities will arrest the main perpetrators and punish them severely to curb this evil trend of crime so that it does not spread everywhere like kidnapping.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Eagerly Entering Prison <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Menglin</p>
<p>Not Gandhi's Non-Resistance</p>
<p>The word "prison" is such a terrible name to us. Everyone avoids it as much as possible, so how can anyone eagerly enter it? Unexpectedly, in this world full of surprises, the people on the other side of the earth actually treat it as paradise because of the climate and geographical conditions.</p>
<p>It turns out that Washington State in the United States recently received a message that Point Hope, Alaska (in the northwest corner of North America), plans to bid for the construction of a larger prison than before. This was originally an ordinary matter. However, the motivation for this matter is too ridiculous. It is said that the Eskimos there not only do not feel ashamed of going to prison, but also intentionally break the law because of the harsh living conditions in the frigid zone, hoping to experience the flavor of a jail cell.</p>
<p>The incident occurred because not long ago, the US military arrested two natives who violated the law. This was not a rare occurrence. However, it caused a surprise. It turned out that they ate well and lived warmly in prison, which was ten times better than living in the icy and snowy conditions. So after they were released from prison, they told their companions about this haven that no one had ever discovered. As a result, they all intentionally committed crimes in order to experience the flavor of a jail cell. The prison was also declared full.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Strange Symptom of Earwigs Entering the Ear and Prevention Methods <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>Earwigs are the easiest to breed and have a long lifespan. Shanghai has a dense population, and there are even more earwigs. Although there are medicinal liquids and powders, they are not easy to popularize due to the high price. My friend Gu Zixing from Jiangsu used to live in a certain village in Zhabei. One night, after falling asleep, he was startled by something entering his ear in his sleep. He hurriedly got up and dug it out, but couldn't get it out. There was a rumbling sound in his ear. At first, he didn't know what it was. He thought it would disappear after a long time, so he didn't care. After more than ten days, he had strange pains at the upper end of the ear root and at the back of the head. The pain came and went. He tried to treat it in Shanghai without effect. After more than a month, the affected area rose up with redness and swelling. He had dizziness and tinnitus. He was mentally exhausted. He then sold his things and returned to his hometown. After being persuaded by someone, he went to Gengsheng Hospital for treatment. Dr. Hui Gengsheng diagnosed that there was a small poisonous animal lurking inside, eating blood and corroding the marrow. Surgery was required. Gu was shocked when he heard the doctor's words. Of course, he obeyed the doctor's orders. He was hospitalized overnight. The doctor performed various surgeries, cutting open from the right ear root and reaching directly to the back of the head. He found that the inner ear membrane had been broken. On the edge of the back of the head, he discovered an earwig the size of a melon seed, which was very fat. He clamped it out. It was still wriggling. The doctor said that it was fortunate that the insect was male and had not bred. If it had been female, it would have been more than two months old and would have been incurable. He gradually recovered and is still alive today. After hearing about this, I can't help but tremble during the summer months. I poured kerosene mixed with soybean oil into the cracks in my residence and bedding, which was quite effective. It is more economical than medicinal liquids and powders. I also fear that they will steal into my camp and launch a surprise attack, so I use medicinal cotton wool to plug my ears when I go to bed as a precautionary measure. Readers who have this problem, why not try it?</p>

<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>The South Pole is "the bottom of the world." The place is extremely cold. When Major Byrd explored it, several interesting things happened. One day, a member of the expedition team had a gap in his mask. The cold wind pierced in, and it was unbearable. He quickly removed his gloves to repair it. Little did he know that his five fingers immediately froze and could not move. Another day, a team member went out to work. After a while, he returned to the cellar, and his head and face were all silver. His whiskers and eyebrows were all white. The cold air had condensed into snowflakes. Once, an iceberg floated in the South Pole. The area was huge. If you calculated it in terms of time (it was summer in the United States at that time), if this iceberg were moved to New York, you could become a millionaire.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Travels in India (63) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Spirit Flower</p>
<p>Everywhere, iron signs are hung. These are arranged by the Mahayana Buddhist Society. On the signs are written: "Those who damage these antiquities will be detained for three months." Occasionally there are stone tablets. On them are carved many kinds of Buddha images. The carving methods are different. The larger stone carvings often depict the Buddha's birth, renunciation, enlightenment, preaching, and nirvana. They are systematic and very impressive. Smaller carvings simply depict the Buddha's image.</p>
<p>There are also Westerners who come to visit. Beyond these desolate ruins, to the north, is a large river. It flows from west to east. Only in winter and spring does its water dry up, leaving only a thin stream, like a small ditch next to a vegetable garden well. One can imagine that in summer the river must be full of water. There is a bamboo forest. The bamboo leaves are very large. Men and women gather firewood, passing back and forth. The women are all dressed in red, like the Chinese depiction of Guanyin. This is because Guanyin is dressed as an Indian woman. Returning to the west side of the university, I took a short rest. I asked someone when these temples and pagodas were built, and when they were abandoned. They said they did not know. Some said they were built by King Ashoka, others said by some later king. This is because Indians do not care about history. In the past, the Mongols also said that the Mongols unified the world, but there is no history to verify this. Donations for the construction of various temples also do not list the names of donors. They laugh at the Chinese for listing names on donation plaques.</p>
<p>The secretary of the Buddhist Society is from Ceylon. He and a gentleman named La Hao argued about the merits of Ceylonese and Indian culture. The Ceylonese said that Ceylonese culture is superior to Indian culture, with no class distinctions, and various other advantages. The Indian, of course, did not admit that Ceylon was superior to India, and said that Chinese culture was even more ancient than Indian culture. Although I do not believe that Ceylonese culture is superior to Indian culture, I am quite surprised that the people of Ceylon are so self-confident, daring to "put dung on the Buddha's head," wanting to surpass India. Indians also do not believe that the Buddha ever went to Ceylon, but the Ceylonese say that they have the Buddha's footprints. This is quite interesting. I told the Ceylonese that they should promote Carpaater's geography book, which says that the origin of the world's people is in Ceylon, and that the Xia surname once lived there. Now there is Adam's Bridge. Based on this, they can claim to be the ancestors of all mankind. Everyone laughed and dispersed.</p>
<p>I returned to school again. The people I saw along the way were mostly dark-skinned. I want to study the reason why Indians are dark-skinned. Generally, half of it is related to ethnicity, and half to habits. I have seen wealthy Indian women, beautifully dressed, living with Europeans, and it is difficult to distinguish them. This is impossible for the Chinese. Poor people are mostly dark because they do not dress up and do not pay attention to hygiene. One reason is the strong sunlight. Indians consider assimilation with nature to be beautiful, and do not feel that their dark skin is bad. Another reason is that they do not wear hats and expose their heads to the sun, not knowing to cover them. However, there is a problem with wanting Indians to wear hats, because Indians like to carry things on their heads, so wearing a hat is also inconvenient. However, if one wants to be beautifully dressed, one must change and wear a hat. I have seen Indians occasionally wearing hats, but only one in a thousand.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Visiting the Chengde Factory <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Yu</p>
<p>The Chengde Cotton Weaving Factory's Chen Zuolin and Zhi Fang brothers recently invited guests to visit their factory's clothing contents at the Puyi Vocational Training Center. On both sides of the hall, various flannels, woolens, silks, and crepes were displayed. Among them, the double-sided flannel and the green crepe were the best. The former is enough to compete with imported camel hair flannel, and the latter is enough to rival Indian silk. Zhao Jinqing, the Vice Minister of Industry, praised and encouraged them after seeing this. Then, factory staff led a tour of the factory. First, they entered the weaving factory. There were a total of forty-eight machines. The sound of the motors was loud, and the shuttles moved back and forth. They were weaving various bleached cloths, intending to resist foreign bleached cloths. Then, they went upstairs and entered the yarn sorting room. Thousands of threads were separated and cleaned by machines. The joining of threads was done by hand. Finally, they entered the silk weaving factory. The machines were weaving silk and Ge cloth. The various patterns were different. The difference in patterns depended entirely on the cardboard at the end of the machine. Each board had holes, arranged irregularly. The weft threads passed through, separated by the holes, and the pattern was formed. After watching for a while, they took their seats for a drink. During the banquet, the Chen brothers recounted the process of starting the factory and the harmonious relationship between labor and management. The Chengde Factory is very large in scale. The weaving machines alone total five hundred. Those in charge are divided into nine departments, named after the number of the factory. Each has its own factory site, not connected to each other. In this way, others may think that dividing up the factories would scatter the power and increase expenses. However, it is unknown that the labor unrest would be dealt with smoothly as a result. The managers actively facilitated marriages for outstanding male and female workers, providing marriage funds limited to two hundred yuan. The new couple could repay the loan monthly. Therefore, the workers were all grateful, and the business prospered. This is something that other factories should emulate. (Reward omitted)</p>

<p>"Can you write something on the cover of this book for me?"</p>
<p>"What is it? You're messing around again."</p>
<p>"Write the four characters 'Food and Sundries'."</p>
<p>"I don't have time!"</p>
<p>"You have time to eat, but after eating, you're not willing to fulfill a little obligation? This ledger is for recording the expenses of side dishes, so it is also part of the work of eating."</p>
<p>"Go write it yourself!"</p>
<p>"My handwriting is not good. I want you to write in the clerical script, it'll look better!"</p>
<p>"Ziliang wants me to go downstairs quickly, so the only way is to write it for her quickly." I immediately picked up the pen and wrote four characters."</p>
<p>"Very sloppy!"</p>
<p>"It's written, you can go."</p>
<p>"Strange! Why do you rush me away as soon as I come?"</p>
<p>"Don't bother me!"</p>
<p>"I want to ask you about a character."</p>
<p>"Thank you! Go downstairs!"</p>
<p>Ziliang was about to cry.</p>
<p>"I don't recognize characters, so of course I have to ask. If I don't ask you, who am I going to ask? A teacher is a teacher. I must ask you. Is the '茭' (jiao) in '茭白' (jiao bai, water bamboo shoot) the '草' (cao, grass) radical or the '竹' (zhu, bamboo) radical?"</p>
<p>"You don't even know that? It's the '草' (cao, grass) radical."</p>
<p>Mrs. was about to speak again, but Ziliang covered her ears with both hands, intending not to listen to her anymore. Suddenly, a burst of military music sounded outside. Mrs. heard it, dropped the ledger in her hand, and quickly went downstairs.</p>
<p>At this time, Ziliang was a little calmer, but she was very worried. She heard the military music outside and ran out to watch. The gate was of course not closed. What if the nanny also followed her? Wouldn't that be even worse than going to the back door to look at the sewer? The back door is a small alley with no through traffic, but the front door is different. What if a thief broke in and took something? What should I do?</p>

<p>The Impact of War Debt Extension is Still Shallow</p>
<p>Stock Markets in Various Countries Frequently Report Lows</p>
<p>This Morning's Major Forecast is Low</p>
<h3 id="e220">Cause and Effect of the Rebound <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, speculative gold resumed its upward trend, and the market conditions felt notably firm. However, the rise and fall were erratic, and the fluctuations were not small, making it difficult to grasp. People's minds were confused. There were twelve or thirteen changes in the morning and evening. As a result, it rose sharply by sixteen taels and zero. It rose early in the morning, because silver bars rose slightly, and the American silver market did not move. Furthermore, the international war debt extension had no impact, and stock markets in the United States and other countries were frequently low. However, the trading by various firms was very different, so the price was already hidden and lurking. Later, due to heavy purchases by major players, foreign exchange, both internal and external, became tight. The market sentiment became increasingly sharp, almost rising to seven hundred and thirty taels. However, Dalian Gang and others did not stop selling, so it fell back. The market showed sharpness again at noon. The latter market was due to the lack of drafts on Wednesday, and the initial market was flat. In the end, the situation was solid, and buyers were also strong. It is predicted that this morning's major listing will definitely be low.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Sharp Rise at the Morning Opening <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The August opening this morning rose seven taels and one mace, calculated at seven hundred and eighteen taels. The major listing rose slightly by one-sixteenth, the silver price did not change, and there were no good or bad private telegraphs. However, there was another telegraph reporting a small one-sixteenth rise, indicating that people's minds were still good. Furthermore, Dalian Gang and Tong Taichang and others took the lead in buying, and Qian Changxiang and speculators also bought. Later, it rose to twenty-three and a half taels, with a fluctuation of one or two taels in between. Later, Fuyu and Yuanheng and others sold, so it retreated to sixteen and a half taels. Then, the English Gold Bank initially absorbed 8125, then 75. In a moment, the gold price rose again to twenty-one and a half taels. Zhifeng Yong and Wanxing and others bought in, and Yongfeng and others sold. Furthermore, the English Gold Bank's buying price of 8125, because 75 was difficult to sell, dropped again to eighteen taels and five mace. The exchange rate announcement had shrunk by 125, US dollars by 25, and Japanese gold increased by 1.5 fen, that is, twenty taels. It increased again to twenty-two and a half taels. Yiyu and others came to sell, and the English Gold still settled at 75 in September, so it was suppressed again to nineteen taels and five mace.</p>
<h3 id="e222">High Point at Twenty-Nine Taels <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly, buying interest was strong. Daxing Yong, Qian Changxiang, Changsheng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Wu, and others all bought in. Furthermore, English Gold was particularly strong, and dealers scrambled for 6875 to 625. Then the gold price jumped ten taels to twenty-nine taels at ten o'clock. Afterwards, Yuanheng, Shunli, Wanxing, and others all came to sell, and English Gold seemed to be loose, with banks dealing at 75, so the price fell sharply by ten taels again. There were two or three taels of twists and turns in between. At ten fifty, it was only nineteen taels. After eleven o'clock, it rebounded sharply. Various firms bought a lot. Hongli, Qian Changxiang, Cuichang Yong, and others all sold some. English Gold was steady and firm, and banks absorbed 75. At eleven thirty, it was about twenty-four taels. Suddenly, it was heard that Indian drafts were slightly lower by six annas, falling by three or four taels in an uproar. At eleven forty-five, it was twenty-eight and a half taels. Hedging firms Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Wanxing always had sales, so it depreciated by five taels again, to twenty-three taels. At noon, the market closed at twenty-four taels, then fell back to twenty-three taels and zero. The listed price was changed to seven hundred and fifty-nine taels, pressing down thirty-nine taels, to thirty taels, then forty taels, to thirty-five taels.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Afternoon Remains Steady <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened at twenty-four taels, then twenty-five taels and five mace. The Indian drafts were slightly lower again by four annas. Wanxing and Shunli bought in slightly. Later, retail clients sold, retreating to twenty-two taels. Hengxing, Tianxiang, Qian Changxiang, and others bought in, increasing it by two taels again. At three o'clock, it was twenty-four and a half taels. Before long, it fell slightly by one tael. After three thirty, the buying interest on the table was overwhelming. Zhifeng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yuanxing Yong, Hengyu, and others all attacked by agreement, so the price gradually rose, until twenty-eight and a half taels at four fifteen. However, there was no market for foreign exchange, but Guangdong merchants came to sell, slightly reducing it by one tael. At four thirty, the market closed at twenty-seven taels and one mace, which was more than sixteen taels and two mace higher than the previous day. After the market closed, it rose again to about eight taels. According to the day's maximum price, twenty-nine taels, the minimum price, sixteen taels and a half, there was a twelve and a half taels up and down. The goods' early market was seventeen taels, noon closed at twenty-three taels and four mace, afternoon was three taels and eight mace, and closed at seven taels and a half. The listed price was pressed down a little thirty-five or six taels to thirty-one taels. The registered price was twenty-seven taels to twenty-four taels, the supplemental water was twenty-seven taels, and the afternoon was thirty taels.</p>

<p>Twenty-Count Yarn's East Ocean Export Trading Moves Again</p>
<p>Recently, the yarn market has suddenly risen and fallen, making it difficult to predict. The market is extremely chaotic. However, according to the actual situation, there should be a possibility of standing firm. Overseas three-product yarn prices are high, and Shenxin Ren Zhong Yarn's export transactions continue. The market price of twenty-count fine yarn is very tight. Therefore, some people are optimistic and absorb long-term contracts, holding them tightly. However, some manufacturers see that the trend of ten-count coarse yarn is sluggish, and the inventory in the warehouse is difficult to reduce. Therefore, they have closed out many long positions. It is said that there is a delivery. Some people sell on the rise. However, Rongxing purchased a lot more.</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants Absorb Long-Term New Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market is bland and unremarkable, with nothing exciting to say. The current summer season is temporarily being held in suspension. The near-month situation is looser, because the factory's stomach is blocked, and sales are not open. The receivers are generally more scarce, so although the bottom goods are thin, and American cotton is also fluctuating and unstable, people's minds are still tired. However, the long-term new cotton market is firmer, and a large number of forehead were absorbed by Japanese merchants, holding them tightly. However, manufacturers still have no intention of asking about the price. The future will depend on foreign cotton for the transition.</p>

<p>A total of twenty-one or two rice boats from Changshu, Xixi, and Xianzi, etc., have arrived along the Suzhou River. The access to urban and rural areas is becoming more active. High-quality Chang rice is the main type, with fewer scattered types, so the selling price is very firm. The merchants' attitude is that during this period between harvests, the bottom inventory is weak, and they all intend to store up, so the price is very tight. However, the money is unusually tight and the prices cannot be raised too much. There is very little rice coming in. The merchants intend to buy Northern Japonica rice as the price continues to rise. Customers have little intent to buy because there is not much local rice. The price has risen one or two jiao. Five or six boats of glutinous rice have arrived, and the top quality is selling very well, with two to three hundred dan in small quantities. The situation is stable. Very little Duyang pointed rice is coming in, and the price is stable.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Wheat Flour Futures: Near Months Fall, Distant Months Rise <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a pattern of weak near months and firm distant months. Both sides of Zikan had fluctuations in the price of imported wheat, but the good side was slightly visible. People's sentiment was not initially moved, hence the reason. Later, due to the rebound in gold prices, the trend became serious, and foreign exchange shrank. Attention was also paid to the difficulty in achieving a favorable price for imported wheat. In addition, there was heavy rain in various places, and low-lying areas became flooded. The inland merchants' mindset became tighter. However, the recent actual sales have been sluggish, and purchasing sentiment has been quiet, so the market sentiment has been weak. There are fewer sales and more purchases in the distant months, so the market situation has risen. In the last few trades in the near term, it was heard that factories such as Fufeng had made offerings, so prices softened slightly again. As a result, the current month is down by 0.25% compared to the previous day, August is unchanged, September is up by 0.5%, October is up by 0.75%, November is up by 1%, and December is up by 1.25%.</p>

<p>Spot wheat transactions total 5,000 to 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the morning market for wheat futures generally showed a stable trend due to the fluctuations in imported wheat, and people's sentiment was unsettled. However, the distant months showed firmness due to the gold price. When the afternoon market opened, trading was very active in all months, and the market sentiment gradually rose together. Although there is a lot of spot product in the current month, the factory purchasing sentiment has become active, and asking prices are also good. The distant months are seeing strong buying by inland merchants, and prices are rising with each transaction. Given this situation, if factories do not have imported wheat in preparation, it is unknown what the inland merchants will do when they manipulate the market and hoard goods. Since no one is asking about new wheat, the repeated displays of power may sway people's sentiment. As a result, the current month is up 0.2% compared to the previous day, August is up 0.2%, September is up 0.1%, October is up 0.3%, November is up 0.2%, and December is up 0.3%. The spot wheat market was still stable yesterday, but trading was more active. The entire market reached 5,000 to 6,000 bags, the first time since the arrival of new wheat. The wheat from Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Hezhou, Liuhe, Shuangfeng, Waigang, Penglai, Danyang, and Caishi, etc., was handled by Huafeng, Xiangxin, and Xinda, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e250">New Orchid Seeds from Northern and Southern Goods Market Will Soon Be Available <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The supply of orchid seeds has been out of stock for a long time. According to reliable news from Zhangzhou, the first batch of new goods this year will be available in mid-July. However, due to excessive rain recently, it may be delayed for a few days, and the color and quality may also be reduced due to the impact of the rain. As for the market price, because old goods had recently reached 50 taels and the first batch is in short supply, it may be difficult to go too low. However, land prices are too high, which may hinder sales in the future market. It is hoped that those in this business should carefully consider the quantity of goods to be sold.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Raw Silk Sales of Yellow/White Silk and Coarse Silk are Sluggish <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market still tended to be firm. Overseas markets saw some competition for Japanese silk, but factories processing yellow and white silk wired that prices were still too high, and telegraphed that business was slowing down. Indian firms also had sluggish purchases of yellow and white coarse silk. Yesterday, only Gaobei and others took in 18 packages of new Qian silk, and Samsung and others took in 15 packages of yellow coarse silk. Prices were still firm.</p>
<h3 id="e252">The Current State of Summer Silkworms in Yixing is Not Good <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Continuous rain and sultry weather... Silkworm diseases are prevalent</p>
<p>Farmers in various towns and villages of Yixing, due to the failure of spring silkworms this year, have all started raising summer silkworms. After the silkworm eggs hatched, the weather was sunny and warm, and the development was quite smooth. Unexpectedly, when the silkworms reached the third sleep stage, there were two days and nights of heavy thunderstorms, coupled with abnormal heat, which caused the silkworms that were in a deep sleep to fail to wake up, excrete yellow and black substances, and become stiff. Deaths were reported daily. Currently, there is no market for mulberry leaves, and the silkworm harvest will inevitably be reduced.</p>

<p>Average cocoon production is only 50%... High-quality cocoons open at $55</p>
<p>Farmers in Linping, Gaosi, Sanbao, Nanshan, and other places in Hangzhou Prefecture have drastically increased the number of summer silkworms raised this year. However, the early silkworms suffered from the weather, and the late silkworms were not good at first. Only after the third sleep did the situation improve, and development was smoother. The new cocoons have entered the market. There are more than a dozen cocoon businesses in the entire county that have opened for business. The average cocoon production is only 50%. Businesses are competing to buy, and the supply of high-quality cocoons is not strong. Cocoon prices are expected to rise. Improved breed cocoons have opened at $55, and native breed cocoons are at $45-46.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first day of implementing the export tea inspection. British firms Jardine Matheson, Xiehe and other firms convened a general meeting to discuss how to deal with it. Although most firms did not unanimously agree, they were not willing to openly oppose it. It is heard that the meeting's result was to request revisions to the inspection rules to ensure convenience is the main goal.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Summer Cloth from Piece Goods is Selling Very Well <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market was slightly stronger yesterday due to the rebound in the gold market, but many merchants were selling in succession, so it was difficult for prices to rise for a time. Fine broadcloth from northern merchants was selling well, with Huxinting at 3 qian, 3 fen, and 7.5 li, and Sanyou Tu at 3 qian, 3 fen, and 2.5 li.

Wool crepe has become sluggish, and prices of various brands have fallen by about 5 fen, with Three Horses at 2 taels and 9 qian, and San Gong at 2 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen. Ting with deep colors has also arrived in Shanghai, priced from 2 qian and 5.5 fen to 6.5 fen. Due to the lack of stock of Yuan Yang yarn, Dian Qiuxiang has risen by 5 fen and was sold yesterday at 11 taels and 1 qian and 5 fen. Shuang Tonglu has been completely sold out, and Hanshan Temple opened at 9 taels and 6 qian. Sales on this street are quite good. White crepe prices remain stable, and sales are better than before, at 40-50 pieces per day. Yesterday, Tongpan was at 4 taels and 1 qian and 5 fen, Rengou at 4 taels and 1 qian and 2.5 fen, and Shuanglu at 4 taels and 1 qian.</p>

<h3 id="e278">The National Defense War Following the "Along the Longhai Line" <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Praise</p>
<p>Written by a company commander under Liang Zhongjia</p>
<p>—Wan Gu'an</p>
<p>Since Mr. Huang Zhenxia's war novel "Along the Longhai Line" was published in the fifth issue of "Qianfeng Monthly," it has attracted the attention of domestic authors and general readers who depict war. Naturally, most of the works in the literary world now are about love affairs and complaints, and the most popular are those that describe triangular love. These are pastimes for women on their pillows, making us feel that although the form of literature and art has undergone special changes through the New Culture Movement, the main trend of thought and general preferences are still dominated by disguised works like "The Romance of the Western Chamber," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "Er Nu Ying Xiong." For more than a decade, the new literary world, both authors and readers, have taken pride in this, which is such a "shameful" thing.</p>
<p>The needs of the environment dictate that literary works can no longer allow "pastimes for women on their pillows" to dominate a generation's thoughts. In fact, there is no lack of talent capable of breaking through this environment and overthrowing these idols. However, authors who have already become famous have developed unbreakable habits in the past environment, making it difficult to abandon or change them, forming an invisible force that prevents the emergence of new forces of resistance. This is also an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Works like "Along the Longhai Line," of course, cannot be considered mature in terms of technique, but they have already broken through the past literary world's bad environment and opened up a new path. This probably won't be denied. I believe that the value of literature and art lies primarily in thought, followed by technique. It is impossible to abandon thought and only talk about technique. Reading a refined and sophisticated work is far less satisfying than reading a stimulating and energetic work. Half of the reason is that the city life of scientific civilization no longer allows for the existence of the habit and interest of "half a day of idle talk and a game of chess," and the other half is the psychological reaction that arises involuntarily in the face of such a dangerous national environment.</p>
<p>Published at the same time as "Along the Longhai Line" was Mr. Wan Gu'an's "A Moment of Revolution." Following "Along the Longhai Line" and "A Moment of Revolution" is Mr. Wan Gu'an's</p>
<p>The National Defense War</p>
<p>This text also uses the novel genre to describe the Manzhouli Sino-Russian battle in the eighteenth year. Mr. Wan was a company commander under Liang Zhongjia of the 18th Brigade, personally experiencing the front lines and truthfully describing everything that happened. In terms of historical value, it seems to surpass "Along the Longhai Line."</p>
<p>Mr. Wan went south in the twentieth year to participate in military affairs along the Longhai Line. It was then that he became friends with Mr. Huang Zhenxia. This "National Defense War" was also written at the urging of Mr. Huang. The writing flows freely, without any embellishment, purely the true colors of a soldier. It is said that it will be published in the sixth issue of "Qianfeng Monthly." Now, the original preface by Mr. Huang is recorded below to show the general content.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, the true face of China as a paper tiger has been exposed, and European countries have followed their 19th-century policy of political aggression, shifting from the African continent to East Asia. They have repeatedly used superior military force to oppress China. At this time, the Qing government, which ruled China, had no resistance to the outside world, and the people of the whole country were completely unaware of the vital interests of national survival. As a result, China suffered more national humiliation than any other country and fell into the humiliating position of a semi-colony. Statistics for these eighty-plus years of imperialist encroachment and annexation show that, in addition to the imperialists using political and economic aggression in the latter half of the period, the military failures involving bloodshed and sacrifice alone include the Opium War, the Anglo-French Allied Expedition, the "Ever Victorious Army" incident, the Sino-French War in Vietnam, the Eight-Nation Alliance Expedition, and the recent Guo Songling incident, the Jinan incident, and the Sino-Russian Manzhouli incident. Other incidents include the massacre on the Heilongjiang River in 1674, the failure of the Taiwanese militia, and various minor massacres and brutal oppressions, which are too numerous to record. Looking back at the war history of decades of national humiliation, we get even more shocking records.</p>
<p>In the Opium War, the British imperialists used 15,000 troops (mostly Indian soldiers) before and after, and the war zone expanded to Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces. The Chinese army resisted with approximately 100,000 troops or more. As a result, the British army won every battle and approached Nanjing.</p>
<p>In the Anglo-French Allied Expedition, the British and French imperialists used 20,000 troops before and after (half of whom were Indian and Annamese soldiers), and the war zone expanded to Guangdong and Zhili provinces. The Chinese army resisted with approximately 80,000 troops or more. In the battle of Xinhe, the British army first tested the shrapnel shells used in modern warfare. Their report to the Secretary of War at the time stated, "The results are excellent. The corpses of Tartar cavalry are all over the mountains and fields." The French army also specially created the Baliqiao Commemorative Medal to encourage "a small lesson given to the yellow race at the Yuanmingyuan." Naturally, the result of this war was that the Chinese army lost every battle, and even the capital was captured. (At that time, the British and French armies' transport teams were all Chaozhou people from Guangdong.)</p>
<p>The Ever Victorious Army incident was the achievement of two British and American adventurers. The adventures of Ward and Gordon. The imperialists wanted to preserve Shanghai as their future center of economic aggression, but it was inconvenient to openly interfere in China's internal unrest. Therefore, they encouraged these two adventurers to organize the Ever Victorious Army, relying on the strength of Guangdong pirates and Zhejiang rogues to defeat the attacking army of the Loyal King Li Xiucheng, creating the foundation of today's Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the Sino-French War in Vietnam, the French imperialists used 30,000 troops before and after, and the war zone extended from Annam to Fujian and Taiwan. The Chinese army resisted with approximately 50,000 to 60,000 troops. As a result, the Chinese and French armies fought fiercely on the border between Guangxi and Annam, and the French army clearly showed signs of being unable to resist. Naval Vice Admiral Courbet also died in depression after the failed attack on Fujian. However, although China made some progress in military affairs this time, the political struggle caused an unprecedented farce, giving Annam to the enemy for nothing.</p>
<p>In the First Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese imperialists used approximately 70,000 to 80,000 troops, and the war zone ranged from the Yellow Sea to Shanhaiguan. The Chinese army resisted with at least 120,000 troops or more. As a result, the Chinese army lost every battle, and the Japanese army conquered China with only 4,000 casualties.</p>
<p>In the Eight-Nation Alliance Expedition, the total number of troops from the eight-nation alliance of Britain, France, Russia, Germany, the United States, Austria, Japan, and Italy was approximately 75,000, but only 16,000 actually participated in the fighting. The front line was only 300 li long (from Dagu to Beijing). The Chinese army resisted (including the Boxers) with a total of 300,000 troops, but the disorganized masses were of no avail, and Beijing was captured by the Allied forces.</p>
<p>In the Guo Songling incident, Japanese artillery joined the Feng army to assist in the attack, eliminating the revolution in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>The Jinan incident was the May 3rd Massacre. Although the Chinese have been promoting that they were massacred without resistance, the opinion of military critics around the world only knows that the revolutionary army was defeated by the Japanese army. (A new book recently published in the United States called "Battlefield of the East" reportedly states, "Four thousand five hundred Japanese soldiers stood dangerously amidst the Chinese army's tide, which was enough to maintain the glory of their Shahe Lushun without shame." Westerners find it difficult to understand the doctrine of non-resistance on the battlefield.)</p>
<p>In the Sino-Russian Manzhouli incident, excluding the eastern front of Tongjiang Mishan, just looking at the battle situation in Manzhouli Zhalannuoer, the Chinese army used 15,000 troops before and after, with four artillery pieces and two airplanes. The Soviet imperialists used approximately 50,000 troops before and after, with 200 artillery pieces, 30 airplanes, and 30 tanks. As a result, although the Chinese army was defeated due to being outnumbered and outgunned, it inflicted heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<p>In this series of national humiliations and war history, it goes without saying that the Sino-Russian War reveals a light of indestructible glory. After clearly explaining this blood-stained bill, let's get back to the main topic and faithfully introduce Mr. Wan Gu'an's "National Defense War." It is said that 18 li north of Manzhouli, where the Chinese Eastern Railway enters Siberia from Chinese territory, there is a wooden national gate standing precariously amidst the yellow sand and white grass, lonely expressing the sacredness of our borders. Mr. Wan used this as the theme, using a faithful pen to record all the tragic events he personally experienced, heard, and witnessed, creating this record of our country's fierce resistance to red imperialism.</p>
<p>The entire article is approximately 60,000 characters long. The author is a company commander under Liang Zhongjia of the 15th Brigade, who fought the fiercest in this battle. With the warm blood of a native of Guanwai and the forthright character of a soldier, he straightforwardly wrote down his various impressions, filled with patriotism everywhere, flowing out from the heart without the slightest hypocrisy. Among them, the actual life of soldiers, the brutality of the Red Guards, the tension during shelling, and the tragic sacrifices during the final breakout are not only unprecedented descriptions in our country's literary world, but also a rare work in various Asian countries besides Japan.</p>
<p>Looking back at the works in the literary world that describe war in recent years, such as Sun Xizhen's "On the Battlefield" and Ms. Bing Xin's "War Diary," although they also have their considerable merits, "National Defense War" still occupies the first place for creative works using foreign wars as the subject matter. The advantage of "National Defense War," excluding the author's technique, is its "authenticity" because the facts all come from the author's personal experience, and it can also be said to be part of his life history, a "heroic diary."</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Wan also married a Russian girl, but he did not expect that she was an enemy spy. In the "Spy" chapter of this book, the author puts his patriotic heart above all else and resolutely kills his lover. "In short, she was for her country, and I was for my country." For this reason, his beloved wife, Liubo, went to become a ghost in the "Tomb of Red Heroes," and he also fought to the bitter end in the trenches of the lonely city under the setting sun, breaking out of the encirclement amidst the smoke and bullets with a heart full of enthusiasm, sadly watching the enemy's sickle and axe replace the flagpoles of Manzhouli.</p>
<p>After reading "National Defense War," I couldn't help but come to a realization. In the past, the Chinese people had a kind of contempt for their own army, thinking that the result of the Chinese army fighting the enemy must be a disastrous defeat. This is also a clear proof given to us by the history of national humiliation. However, readers only need to take a look at "National Defense War," take a look at those warriors who used unusable machine guns to resist the charge of thousands of enemy cavalry, and take a look at those hundreds of heroes who fought tanks with their bare hands and flesh. Chinese people, believe in the military power of your motherland!</p>
<p>The Greeks have the three hundred warriors in the Thermopylae Pass, the Japanese have the Yamato spirit under Lushun Mountain, the Turks have Osman Pasha of Plevna, the French have the guards who died unyielding at Waterloo, the British have the light cavalry of Balaclava, and we also have our heroes in the snowy Manzhouli.</p>
<p>People hiding in Guanli, people in the big cities with their red lanterns and green wine, people complaining in the pavilions, young people of China, do you still remember that incident on November 21, 1929? Do you still remember that six thousand miles away, under the national gate of yellow sand and white grass or icy snow, there were thousands of brave and tragic northeastern men resisting the red terror? I am afraid you have completely forgotten it. If you have forgotten, please look at—"National Defense War"—</p>
<p>In short, the above are just some scattered introductions. In the future, when people share the same vision, someone will naturally come out to take on the responsibility of criticism. Because I had previously strongly encouraged Mr. Wan in Henan to write his spoken stories into articles, now that he has successfully completed them and written them more vividly and powerfully than he narrated, I am of course very happy to write this short introduction.</p>

<p>The Unemployed Seek Inexpensive Education; Book Content Shifts From the Fictitious to the Real</p>
<p>According to American newspapers, during this economic downturn, the number of people reading books in libraries has increased significantly, and the types of books selected have also shifted from novels to more practical works, such as history, travel, biographies, languages, and industrial guidance. The reason is that unemployed people have nothing to do and often go to libraries to read and pass the time, and seek inexpensive education. At the same time, the publishing industry is also showing the same trend. According to the latest survey, the most novels were published in 1927, totaling 36 million copies. Only 6 million copies were published in 1929. The publication of history books alone has increased significantly, totaling 3 million volumes. Some people say that writers have recently been striving for simpler texts and are increasingly inclined to the interest of human affairs, so the number of readers is increasing.</p>

<p>More Than 100 Vehicles Have Been Accepted; 500 Vehicles Are Under Negotiation</p>
<p>According to the Dongbao, the Japanese Vehicle Company is working hard to sell to China Railways because the domestic market is poor. Recently, the Automobile Manufacturing Company, Kawasaki Vehicle Company, and Japanese Vehicle Company have jointly accepted an order for 100 freight cars and 4 locomotives for the Jiaoji Railway, manufactured by the South Manchuria Railway's Shahe Factory. Due to the long-term impact of the war, China's railways have been somewhat abandoned. In order to improve them, they are successively ordering newly built vehicles from the Japanese Vehicle Company. The current issues are as follows:</p>
<p>Shenhai Railway: 30 passenger cars</p>
<p>Longhai Railway: 6 locomotives</p>
<p>Ditto: 200 freight cars</p>
<p>Jinpu Railway: 80 locomotives</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway: Ditto 10</p>
<p>Ditto: 200 freight cars</p>
<p>However, according to China's financial situation, it is difficult to pay immediately. It is proposed to pay in installments within three years after delivery. The Shanghai Bank of China was asked to guarantee the amount, but the bank refused. The Japanese car industry is currently appealing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, asking them to use the surplus of more than 1.6 million yuan from the special accounting for Sino-Japanese cultural affairs to ensure the recovery of the price of vehicle exports, etc.</p>

<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Twenty-eighth. The enemy occupied the high ground south of the Vansel River and stopped advancing. (Note: The reason for the stoppage was later discovered to be as follows: The German army attacked the British army from March 21 to April 9. At first, it was quite successful, but due to the assistance of the French reserve forces, it eventually failed. The enemy then decided to continue attacking the British army in front of the French front, first restricting the French reserve forces, so there was the attack on the Ximing River on May 27. The original plan of the Ximing River attack was only to occupy the high ground south of the Vansel River as the goal. This is the reason why the enemy stopped advancing on the 28th. Seeing the unexpected victory within two days, the German high command changed its plan that night and ordered the attack to continue, attacking southwestward past Sayasson, directly heading for Paris, and attacking southward to take the Marne River, cutting off the Paris-Nancy railway.) Twenty-ninth. The attack resumed, more violently than the previous two days. The French army has been severely damaged and is unable to resist. The enemy's central front is 15 to 20 miles long and is advancing rapidly, occupying the high ground controlling the north bank of the Marne River that evening.</p>
