<p>世人曾注意日本所謂滿洲鐵路政策者乎所謂吉會鐵路、本日所寢食不忘者、查吉會鐵路係由中國吉林至朝鮮會寗之鐵路、由會寗現有鐵路可以通至朝鮮東海岸之清津港、今假定此路一通、由長春經清津至大阪之水陸行程、共費五十七小時、較之由長春經大連至大阪水陸行程共費九十二小時者相差約及一倍、其所經之海路、全在日本海内、即對馬海島東北、絶無受他國艦隊威脅之虞、一旦日本與他國開戰、可以經由此路由南北滿洲運輸物資、又可輸送其大批陸軍至北滿腹部、其省費省時又無危險、且吉會路沿綫有豐富之森林足供日本二百年之木料、若此路開通、日本每年、萬萬金元以上之木材輸入、可以不須仰給他國、又有新邱大炭礦可資利用抽取煤油、若此路開通、則日本煤油問題可以自給、且此路與中東路東部綫平行、清津又爲要港若此路開通海參威必成廢港、而中東路東線亦必大受其影響、中國府鑒於吉會在政治上經濟上影響中國過鉅、故不欲其完成、不特不願日本修築、即中國自身亦不願修築、惟中國所不欲者、爲日本所必欲取、其國論認吉會鐵路之成否、爲日本興衰所關、良有以也、查吉會路由吉林至敦化間一百二十八里、已由中國借日欵修築、圖們江（即止韓國界）至天寳山間、已修有輕便鐵路、惜天寳山至敦化間一段六十五里、尙未修築預料日本必乘此佔領滿洲期内、開工日夜修築、只須此路成功、其結果即足以影響世界、而中國所受之脅迫、更不待言、此吾人所欲促世界注意者也、此外日本所欲修築之鐵路、爲長大路長春至哈爾濱西北之大賚、可以衝入北滿腹地、洮南至索倫、及通遼至熱河之鐵路、均可以衝入蒙古腹地、若時間或情勢許可、確在修築之列、此外如日本人在中國領土地所有欋、日本人不納税滿、洲全部鐵煤森林權警察駐紮權、延長吉長鐵路管理權至九十九年、滿洲特產物之專權、中東鐵路收回時、日本供給借欵權安東營之築港權、及運輸聯絡權、滿洲中銀行設立合辦權、牧畜權政、治財政軍事顧問之增聘權、等等、皆日本所宣傳、所謂將以軍事行動貫澈其目的者、此外中國已修之電山通遼瀋各等路及葫蘆島築港、日本又欲破壞、世人對於日本此種野心不知將作如何之感想也</p>

<p>自日禍暴發舉國悲憤。切齒咬牙。流涙痛哭。開會也。游行也。講演也。請願也。排貨也組織義勇軍也。舉凡足以表示抗暴救國之行動。無不畢備。民氣沸騰。已達百度以上。有此激昻之民氣。誠足以證明我國魂猶在。人心未死。凡一滴之血涙。一聲之號呼。皆我國家我民族無價之瓌寳。足以振起我古老之國魂。獨是證之往事。吾人隱憂正多國人心理之脆弱。善怒善忘之根性。一次外患凌迫。舉國人民即如吸鴉片。打嗎啡。立時奮起。椎心泣血。激昻慷慨。誠足以動天地而泣鬼神。然而其來也暴。其去亦速。從難久持。事過境遷。即頓時低落。不幾何時。酣夢復作。三十年來。往復循環。從無二樣。嚮使甲午敗衂以後。朝野力謀維新之精神。能終始保持。决不至有庚子之辱。退一步言。如五四運動之精神。能保持及今。亦斷不至有濟南之慘案。尤不至有今日日人之暴行。就使有之。我國人亦斷不至忍辱負重。呑聲飮泣。惟以鎭靜與無抵抗態度。坐待强敵之宰割。物必先腐。而後蟲生之。國必自伐。而後人伐之。國人泄泄沓。晏安酖毒。三十年來如一日。本身無日不處於衰老崩漬之中無日不足以召瓜分滅亡之禍。今日之變。夫豈偶然。故抗日爲消極的。救國乃爲積極的。痛哭流涕。奔走號呼之老調。不足以抗日。尤不足以救國。今日之事。惟有舉國上下。同心一德。咬緊牙關。忍住痛涙。長保奮門之精神。長持方升之朝氣。臥薪嘗膽。生聚敎訓。結束過去怯弱因循懶惰衰老恥辱之歷史。庶足以開闢我國家民族廣坦光明嶄新之前途。吾人以爲在今日情勢之下。我舉國國民都應。（一）認清自己之力量。自我之力量乃爲眞力量。乃最可靠。此處所提示之「自己」小而言之爲個人。擴大言之則爲全體民衆。個人應認清自己力量。民衆尤應認清自己之力量。今日之事。惟我乃能救我。惟民衆奮起乃能救國。我有力量足以自救。民衆有力量足以救國。依賴他人。如靠冰山。决難倖存。我國民個人。我全體民衆。在今日情勢之下。都應把握自己之力量。作切實有效之奮門</p>
<p>（二）先求諸己。次乃責人。國勢危迫。禍因不種於一朝。責任尤不在於一人。我舉國人民。都爲惡因之播種者。對今日之禍變。即都應直接負責。進一步言。禍變已發。即應急謀補救。圖謀補救先求諸我。次乃責人。亦惟己先盡責。乃能責人。若徒諉過於人。責善於人。滿腹牢騷。終怒詈。於國何裨。使人人能持犧牲之决心。作艱苦之奮門。不談空言。切寳負責。合四萬萬人之偉力。我固何有於日寇。何有於目前这艱難。（三）利用家庭親友各種關係。以小組織之形式。互相監勉。擴大之組織可暫而不可常。人數旣多。意見淆混。每難持久。欲長保奮門之精神。長持盈滿之朝氣。使其永久無替。必以小組織之形式。互相聯合。持切實有效之目標。互相監督。互相勉勵。更父誡其子。兄誡其弟。務使人人常存臥薪嘗膽之心。常存自　自救之念。以如此之精神。生聚敎訓。我敢斷言。不出十年。我國家必可以一舉而震撼世界。</p>
<p>上述三端。類皆平庸無奇。但今日之事。不在於談高調。不在於放空砲。民情激昻。今已達極巔矣。約而使納於智理之正軌。使其歸於有效奮門之坦途。此正其時。能就上述三端。切實執行。即足以救我國家。興我民族。否則一鼓作氣。再衰三竭。椎心泣血之餘。將無以爲繼矣。國人其勿忘五分鐘熱度之譏。其堅决意志作切實有效永久之奮門。</p>

<p>— 施雨田</p>
<p>自九月十九日。暴日佔我東省·殺戮吾民。國人一致憤慨。是以反日擴大宣傳。一體抵制日貨。與日經濟絶交。抵制日貨。首重提倡國貨。人人所共知。即如吾人日不可缺之衣食住而論。食住果無需日貨。而衣服一項。吾人用日貨者爲特多。爰將所見。投之本談。上等階級之衣服上等階級不受金錢限制。衣絲綢及嗶嘰呢絨。（按眞嗶嘰呢絨爲西洋貨）然所用裏子。仍不離日貨·如人造絲。副綢。及外有美觀質料不堅之板綾等等。比比皆是。</p>
<p>中下階級之衣服中下階級人。每因金錢關係。以絲綢嗶嘰呢絨等價值昻貴。而國產各布又少美觀。故均用冲嗶嘰·冲直貢等等。（按冲貨均爲日貨）凡中下階級人。以其價廉有外觀。故均樂購之。試問每年外溢金錢幾何。</p>
<p>國產土布之歷史國產土布已有數千年之歷史。在此商戰時代。不爲淘汰。能保持其固有地位。（試觀佃農仍服土布）當然有相當利益。其質料这堅固。遠勝西洋貨这眞嗶嘰。遑論東洋貨。其價值較東西洋貨廉數十倍。數千年相沿寒暑爲衣服。則現在何妨仍然用士產布製衣服。個人旣節省金錢。又少外溢金錢。何樂而不爲。</p>
<p>曾國藩提倡士產布之上行下效遜清曾國藩。（曾爲湖南臨漳人）當時手握軍符。治軍嚴肅。自奉儉樸。所有衣服悉爲臨漳土布。（臨漳爲產布之區）僚屬若衣</p>

<p>吾讀國際聯盟會之消息。不禁</p>
<p>有次之二問。</p>
<p>（一）日本趱府宣佈在滿洲未有土地目的敢問日本政府。是否在滿洲有統治目的如其無之。則參與吉林省政權（包含民政軍政）者曷故。</p>
<p>（二）日政府繼續儘速將其軍隊撤回至鐵路區域。敢問儘速二字。有如何限度。亘千百年。亦未始不可解爲非儘速也·敢問鐵路區域四字。如何定其界説。吉省之吉長鐵路。吉敦鐵路。吉海鐵路。向無日軍之足迹。今所謂鐵路區域。是否團指南滿鐵路安奉鐵路而言。</p>
<p>華美絲綢衣服。必加申斥。甚至撤職。因之軍中士兵僚屬。均改服臨漳土布。軍行所至。地方官紳趨謁營幕者。必服臨漳布衣。臨漳布遂得盛名。銷數驟增。（綢布業中年在四十歲者均知臨漳布銷路之盛况）此非上行下效之功耶。</p>
<p>政府諸公首宜提倡國產布以示抵制與節儉今年全國人民。受水災之浩刧。吾民已無噍類。開源節流。當相提並論。衣服爲人生必需品。但奢華與儉樸。相懸殊鉅。故望政府諸公。首先提倡土布。上至主席。下至僚屬。一律改服土布。（土布製長袍短裝均無不可）則全國人民。自然上行下效。（吾國人索具模仿性）不三。月土布銷數之大增。外貨無形呆滯。此可斷言者也。</p>

<p>十來年前。金剛鑽和獅子牌的牙粉。在中國是委暢消的。自無敵牌牙粉一出。金剛鑽和獅子牌的牙粉。便無形打倒了。而今無敵牌的牙粉風行全國。這種利益。可不是從日人手裏拿回來的嗎。那末發明無敵牌牙粉的天虚我生。便可以算得是個中國的甘地喲。蘇甲元的緞青布和毛藍布在前清時代。老百姓最喜歡用它。因爲這種布。又經濟又耐穿。可是漂亮的人多不用。至於仕大夫。只有帶孝的。拿着這種布來做袍褂用。至於太太小姐們拿。這布來做衣服的。絶對没有。聽説從前朱益番的老太太很喜歡用蘇甲元的緞青做鞋子穿。辛亥革命。改裝不易服。蘇中甲元布變爲愛國布。那時國内朝野上下。那一個穿的不是愛國布呢。絲呢嗶嘰一類的東西。很難看見。這個利益不曾送給外人。那末改良愛國布的蘇甲元。不也算得一個中國的甘地嗎。至於馮玉祥十二月裸著身於在雪地裏打拳。陶知行自己寫油印宣傳平民敎育。大糞主義的作者聶雲台常吃白飯不用小菜。中國紡織大家朱仙舫十六七個銅版過一天。都可以算得中國的甘地呀。中國的甘地多著哩。那裏没有甘地呢。</p>

<p>當着這時候、東北的健兒、正在擲頭顱灑熱血、慨慷激昻的去抵抗包藏禍心的倭奴所投來的礮火底時節、老友劉士木先所編的「日本海外侵略與華僑」這部書、也隨着出來了、這類關於揭發敵方的侵略秘幕的書籍、在平時讀了、還且要痛心疾首、在這國難當前讀了更令人髮指、日本人的到處侵略人家、逞着他們的國體比較的强盛、橫衝直撞、不惜以世界罪魁的身分自居、思之可恨、然而、恨之亦徒然、日本的礮火已無可制止的在東北一帶爆發了、這足證明他們的北進政策是已達到沸點的時候、在本書裏、曾有過這樣的解釋他們的侵略手段的話、「日本在東方肆行侵略的手段、分爲兩路、一路是利用無數的陸軍、在我國北方、拓展他逐步蠶食的殖民政策、名爲北進派、一路是利用無數的海軍、在我國南方、拓展他一網打盡的殖民政策、名爲南進派」</p>
<p>當此他們北進極端活躍的時候、我們來掘發他們南進内幕的情形、似乎是來得痛快的吧、</p>

<p>Important figures in the Northeast warned Yuan Yu and others (Beiping) The situation in recent days seems calm on the surface, but in reality, it is extremely dangerous. Japan's advance into southern Manchuria is a permanent occupation plan. Although the League of Nations has acknowledged the withdrawal of troops, it has used frustrated military and political figures and former Qing royal family officials and bureaucrats to organize so-called public order maintenance associations, taking control of municipal administration, finance, transportation, etc. By the time the troops are withdrawn, the three provinces will no longer be ours. They will use the name of Chinese autonomy to deceive various countries. This conspiracy is gradually being exposed. The Self-Determination Association, formed by people from the Northeast in Tianjin and Beiping, has sent people back to Fengtian to explain the pros and cons to Yuan Jinkai and others, telling them not to sacrifice the country and the race for the sake of protecting their personal wealth. (3rd Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Vice Zhang Yu said that the Northeast independence movement only exists where the Japanese army occupies. It has not been heard of elsewhere. The Japanese government says it is not involved in the Northeast independence movement, but when Xi Qia took office, he was given the seal by the Japanese commander Tsuboi. Also, the police bureau's announcement stated that they were under the command of the Japanese commander. (3rd Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An important figure in the Northeast said that the important figures in the Northeast in Beiping believe that the Japanese took advantage of our severe floods to dispatch heavy troops, occupying Liaoning and Jilin, and wanting to swallow up Korea. They are using Yuan Jinkai, Yu Chonghan, and others to conspire for Northeast independence. Yu and others do not understand the pros and cons and are being used by the Japanese, only wanting to seek their own territory, disregarding the country's territory, and they are mad and deserve to be hated. It is planned to jointly issue a telegram warning Yu and others within the next few days. If they continue to do evil and do not change, there will be countermeasures. (3rd Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Association wrote to Yuan Jinkai and Yu Chonghan, saying that if the Japanese force them, they should sacrifice their lives.

Heilongjiang has not been invaded by the Japanese army. Although the Japanese side wants to incite independence, it may not be possible. This time, the Japanese cut off the telecommunications in the Eastern Provinces, preventing the truth from being revealed to the outside world. Currently, important figures in the central government are discussing ways to deal with the Japanese side. I firmly believe that if international justice exists, Japan will eventually withdraw its troops and return to their original location.

<p>(Harbin) Although the Japanese army has withdrawn part of its main force in the occupied areas, it still leaves a large number of Japanese soldiers to monitor various institutions and telegraph offices. It has been found that foreigners in Shenyang, Jilin, Zhengjiatun, Xinmin County, etc., were originally safe, but after the Japanese army estimated that the military police had been disarmed, public order deteriorated. Later, the Japanese army overturned the original administrative offices in the four places and forced the organization of puppet governments, which were supervised by the Japanese military police. Personnel and administration were carried out according to their intentions. Their intention is to first separate the Eastern Provinces from the central government and secretly be ruled by the Japanese, just like Japan forced Korea to separate from the Qing Dynasty and become an autonomous country in the past. The tricks of the devils are clearly revealed. Since the Japanese side has destroyed our administrative integrity, our side has no way to bear the responsibility of protecting overseas Chinese. In Changchun City, Japanese soldiers are still supervising and directing our public security bureau.

<p>Geneva Today's representative, Yosawa, also sent a government note to the League of Nations Council, sophistically arguing about the content of the Japanese army's acts of violence in Manchuria in four main points: (1) Denies the unwarranted arrest of Chinese people in Manchuria, and claims that the Japanese army respects all public and private property in the occupied areas. (2) Solemnly denies that Japanese planes bombed the Beining Railway train. (3) Police power in Shenyang will be handed over to a committee organized by Chinese people. (4) The armed guards at the gates of Shenyang have been withdrawn, leaving only two people at each gate, and the important entrances to Shenyang have also been guarded by the police. (2nd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London According to news from Geneva, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations Administrative Council sent a document to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, which was forwarded to the Administrative Council, denying the two points raised by the Chinese representative at the last meeting of the Administrative Council, saying that the Japanese army had never arbitrarily detained Chinese civilians and strictly respected and protected property. Special plans have been adopted to protect public buildings and valuable monuments from damage. After order is restored, these plans will naturally be cancelled. The document also stated that no trains on the Beining Railway had been bombed. The document attached a telegram from Tokyo on September 30 regarding the current situation in Shenyang, which stated that since September 21, Chinese police have been patrolling Shenyang under the command of Japanese military police. This duty will soon be transferred to the Committee for Maintaining Order, which has now been formed by Chinese gentry and directors. On September 21, the armed guards between the city of Shenyang and the railway area were replaced by police. On September 28, the Japanese guards withdrew from all the gates of Shenyang, and there are currently two gates that have not been withdrawn. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>It Can Be Said That the Japanese Army Has Completed Its Work</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee formally denied the news reported by the British newspaper that Russian cavalry and armored troops had entered Chinese territory in northern Manchuria, stating that Russian armed forces had not crossed the border into Manchuria, and that the Russian army was not prepared to enter Chinese territory. At the same time, it announced that Foreign Minister Litvinov had another lengthy meeting with Japanese Ambassador Hirota, but the content of the talks was kept secret. Today, the Communist Party's official newspaper discussed the Manchuria incident, saying that the situation in Liaoning and Jilin has developed to a point where the Japanese army is no longer important, because the Northeast Army has been disarmed, its weapons have been looted, its arsenals have been destroyed, and the railways of the two provinces have been taken over by the Japanese, which is sufficient to fully prevent the Chinese authorities from restoring their power. Therefore, it can be said that the Japanese army has completed its work, and in the future, it will have to use the police to complete the rest of the work. Before this incident occurred, the Japanese police in Manchuria were already very powerful, and in the future, they will be the only armed force that can dominate everything. It also stated that Japanese imperialism will separate Manchuria from the Chinese mainland and make it a second Korea. After Japan's specific demands on China are revealed to the world, it is expected that the hostility between imperialists will become more intense. The United States has already clearly expressed its attention to Manchuria and demanded to share a piece of the pie. (2nd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

On the 1st, they visited the 95th Brigade Headquarters and the Donghai County Government and learned that a Japanese warship had been discovered outside Nannan Mountain on the 27th. On the 29th, the Yuan Tai, a merchant ship converted from a Japanese warship, arrived at Dapu and docked in Sanyang. The Geng Battalion of the 284th Regiment was stationed at Beigushan on the coast and defended the various harbors of Xilian Island and Sunjiashan. An order was also given to set up artillery positions at Baitaizui to strengthen the coastal defense. They then went to Dapu, where part of the 283rd Regiment was stationed. Trenches had been dug around the east, west, and north sides of Dapu. The Japanese ship was monitored by a team sent by the 95th Brigade, which prohibited it from landing. As a result, the news was tense. Currently, the 95th Brigade is stationed at the strategic locations of Xugou, Dapu, and Qingkou. The Japanese ship has left and the people's hearts have been calmed. On the 2nd, together with Zhang Zixing, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 95th Brigade, and Bian Jiyun, Chief of Staff, they inspected Xugou and found that the artillery positions were extremely well defended. The Fu Battalion of the 283rd Regiment is stationed in Qingkou and has also built fortifications at the harbor. Because it was too far away, they did not go. On the 3rd, they returned to Xuzhou.

<h3 id="e29">Letter to All Nations of the World <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Describing the Manchurian Tragedy and Exposing Japan's Conspiracy of Aggression; Hoping the International Community Maintains Faith and Justice (Nanjing) The National Federation of Commerce has recently issued a letter to all nations of the world, stating: On the night of September 18th, Japanese troops stationed in various parts of Manchuria simultaneously took independent action, occupying Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, Andong, Goubangzi, and other key locations. This sudden action not only shocked the Chinese people but should also astonish people worldwide as unprecedented. However, this event was not accidental. Investigations reveal that Japanese militarists have determined their policy of invading China in recent months and have repeatedly sought ways to realize it. For example, in the Wanbaoshan Incident in Jilin, Japan intended to use this as a pretext to provoke China, but it did not succeed due to China's policy of non-resistance. Following this, there was a large-scale, organized massacre of overseas Chinese in various parts of Korea, causing tens of thousands of peaceful and defenseless people to lose all their property, and hundreds to be injured or killed. The aim was nothing more than to incite the Chinese people to anger and seek revenge, so that Japanese militarists could then use this as an excuse to achieve their major objective. Again, the cunning plan of the Japanese militarists failed due to the Chinese people's forbearance and self-respect. Recently, the Japanese side has claimed that the Nakamura Incident occurred. According to their assertions, a Japanese army captain named Shintaro Nakamura was killed by Chinese people while traveling in Mongolia. His name was not announced due to fears of danger. Since then, the Japanese militarists have been poised for action, eager to try. However, because the Chinese side has been trying to resolve the matter diplomatically and has sent personnel three times to investigate the truth, the Japanese militarists saw that this matter would be resolved through diplomatic means, and they would not be able to achieve their objective. Therefore, the sudden action took place on the night of September 18th. At the time of this action, the Japanese militarists used the excuse that Chinese troops had destroyed the South Manchurian Railway. This kind of excuse is extremely ridiculous. Since Japan occupied the South Manchurian Railway, it has forcibly claimed the land on both sides of the railway as an affiliated area, where it exercises its administrative and police powers, and prohibits the free passage of Chinese soldiers and police. Therefore, Chinese soldiers and police do not usually approach the railway zone and are prevented from doing so by Japanese soldiers and police. How could they approach the railway and destroy it? Therefore, the claim of destroying the railway is a fabricated excuse by the Japanese militarists. Because of this Japanese brutality, Chinese troops have been disarmed. As far as is known now, the highest local official of Liaoning Province has been detained and humiliated. Armories and military warehouses have been burned or occupied. Many houses have been burned. To date, the losses suffered have been extremely heavy, and it is still unknown to what extent they will amount to in the future. According to announcements from Tokyo, this incident was a sudden event, belonging to a local nature. In reality, this incident was a carefully considered, planned, and organized action by Japan, and it was definitely not a sudden event. It can be proved by observing the tense situation of the Japanese militarists in the past few months and their actions of simultaneously occupying key locations in South Manchuria within a few hours. However, the Chinese people are peace-loving and respect international treaties. They are unwilling to add to the East Asian unrest and indirectly impede world peace because of this act of brutality, so they have exercised extreme tolerance and temporarily adopted a policy of non-resistance. Since the Great War, China has strived to build a new-style nation. In accordance with the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, China welcomes European and American capital to cooperate under fair conditions and develop China's resources for the mutual benefit of global commerce and China. However, the intentions of the Japanese militarists are completely opposite to this. They intend to place all of China under Japan's sphere of influence for the development of Japan alone. They constantly obstruct the open-door policy, making it difficult to implement. Japan believes that the current global economic panic has reached its peak, and various countries are too preoccupied to attend to affairs in the East. China itself is in the extremely difficult process of building a new nation and is plagued by nationwide floods and hundreds of thousands of bandits, making it difficult to confront Japan. Therefore, Japan is implementing its policy of aggression at this time, hoping to achieve its major objective. In 1914, when the European Great War was in progress, Japan took the opportunity to present China with the so-called Twenty-One Demands, which nearly reduced China to a Japanese dependency. The interests of all nations were significantly affected. This incident is completely the same in its aims and means.</p>
<p>Have the people of the world paid attention to Japan's so-called Manchurian railway policy? What Japan is constantly preoccupied with is the Jihui Railway. Investigations reveal that the Jihui Railway is a railway from Jilin in China to Huining in Korea. From Huining, the existing railway can reach the port of Chongjin on the east coast of Korea. Now, assuming this road is open, the land and sea journey from Changchun via Chongjin to Osaka would take a total of fifty-seven hours, which is about half the time of the land and sea journey from Changchun via Dalian to Osaka, which takes ninety-two hours. The sea route it passes through is entirely within the Sea of Japan, that is, northeast of Tsushima Island, and there is no danger of being threatened by the fleets of other countries. Once Japan goes to war with other countries, it can transport materials from North and South Manchuria through this route, and it can also transport its large army to the interior of North Manchuria. It saves costs and time and is not dangerous. Moreover, the Jihui Railway has abundant forests along its route, which can provide Japan with two hundred years' worth of timber. If this road is opened, Japan will not need to rely on other countries for its annual timber imports worth more than tens of millions of yuan. There is also the Xinqiu Great Coal Mine, which can be used to extract kerosene. If this road is opened, Japan's kerosene problem can be self-sufficient. Moreover, this road is parallel to the eastern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Chongjin is also an important port. If this road is opened, Vladivostok will become a waste port, and the eastern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway will also be greatly affected. The Chinese government, considering that Jihui has too great an impact on China politically and economically, does not want it to be completed. Not only does it not want Japan to build it, but it also does not want to build it itself. However, what China does not want is what Japan must take. Its national opinion believes that the success or failure of the Jihui Railway is related to Japan's rise and fall, and there is good reason for this. Investigations reveal that the 128-mile section of the Jihui Railway from Jilin to Dunhua has already been built by China using Japanese loans. The light railway from Tumen River (i.e., the border with Korea) to Tianbaoshan has also been built. It is a pity that the 65-mile section from Tianbaoshan to Dunhua has not yet been built. It is expected that Japan will take advantage of this occupation of Manchuria to start construction day and night. As long as this road is successful, its consequences will be enough to affect the world, and the threat to China will be even greater. This is what we want to urge the world to pay attention to. In addition, the railways that Japan wants to build are the Changda Railway, from Changchun to Dalai in the northwest of Harbin, which can penetrate into the interior of North Manchuria, and the railways from Taonan to Solun and from Tongliao to Rehe, which can penetrate into the interior of Mongolia. If time or circumstances permit, they are definitely on the list for construction. In addition, there are the rights of Japanese people to own land in Chinese territory, the exemption of Japanese people from taxation, the full rights to railways, coal mines, and forests in Manchuria, the right to station police, the extension of the management rights of the Jichang Railway to ninety-nine years, the monopoly rights to Manchurian specialty products, the right to provide loans when the Chinese Eastern Railway is taken back, the right to build ports and transportation links in Andongying, the right to establish joint ventures for Manchurian central banks, grazing rights, the right to increase the number of political, financial, and military advisors, etc. These are all the things that Japan is promoting, and they are the so-called things that it will achieve with military action. In addition, Japan also wants to destroy the railways that China has already built, such as the Dianshan, Tongliao, and Shenyang railways, as well as the port construction in Huludao. I wonder what the people of the world will think of Japan's ambitions.</p>
<p>Japan is a member of the League of Nations, a signatory to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, this action completely violates the aforementioned treaties, making various national treaties and international law into scraps of paper, and deeply and greatly affecting world peace. More than 70% of China's provinces have suffered major floods, requiring international relief. Although the American wheat loan was obtained, it was not significant. However, the Manchurian provinces still have surplus grain that can be supplied to the disaster victims. The Chinese government has decided to transport the grain from Manchuria to feed the disaster victims, but the Japanese militarists have suddenly occupied the Manchurian railways, cutting off transportation and leaving tens of thousands of Chinese disaster victims to sit and wait for death. They do not remember the precedent of world assistance during the Tokyo earthquake and have completely extinguished humanity. This is the ultimate example of this. It is that Japanese militarists are not only enemies of peace but also enemies of humanity. The way to maintain world peace lies only in mutual trust between countries. The conclusion of various international conventions also lies in increasing the sense of trust and security safeguards between countries and reducing the fear of danger, so as to smoothly proceed on the path of disarmament. However, Japan tramples on and disregards various international conventions that it has joined, causing the world's concept of trusting international conventions to be completely swept away. If this kind of action is not judged by international justice, then who will dare to trust any international conventions in the future? It will inevitably lead to a path of arms competition, and its impact on world peace is truly immeasurable. China believes that in order to maintain the dignity of international conventions, to maintain the dignity of justice and humanity, and to ensure the foundation of world peace, all countries will have appropriate measures for Japan's actions of trampling on conventions and extinguishing humanity this time. China also hopes that the Japanese people, for the sake of respecting international conventions and maintaining justice and humanity, will urge their government and militarists to correct their mistakes themselves. However, China still has something to declare to the world: the actions of the Japanese militarists this time are an unparalleled insult to China. In order to protect its survival and maintain world peace, China will never allow the Japanese militarists to run rampant, and it will especially not allow them to disregard international treaties by taking advantage of existing mistakes and making even the slightest changes to the status quo in Manchuria and Mongolia.

<h3 id="e32">Responsibilities of the General Public in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Japanese disaster, the entire country is filled with grief and indignation, grinding their teeth and tearing their hair, weeping bitterly. There are meetings, parades, speeches, petitions, boycotts, and the organization of volunteer armies. Every action that can express resistance to violence and national salvation is fully prepared. Public sentiment is boiling, reaching above 100 degrees. This kind of aroused public sentiment is truly enough to prove that our national soul is still alive, and people's hearts have not died. Every drop of blood and tears, every cry of appeal, is a priceless treasure of our nation, enough to revive our ancient national soul. The only thing is, based on past events, we have many hidden worries. The psychology of the Chinese people is fragile, and their nature is to be easily angered and quickly forgotten. Once a foreign invasion is imminent, the people of the whole country are like smoking opium or taking morphine, immediately rising up, tearing their hearts and weeping blood, aroused and impassioned, truly enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. However, it comes quickly, and it goes quickly. It is difficult to maintain for long. Once the matter has passed, it immediately declines. Before long, sound sleep returns. For the past thirty years, it has been repeating over and over, never changing. If the spirit of the court and the people to vigorously seek reform after the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War could have been maintained from beginning to end, there would never have been the humiliation of the Boxer Rebellion. To put it another way, if the spirit of the May Fourth Movement could have been maintained until now, there would definitely not have been the tragic Jinan Incident, and even more so, there would not have been the Japanese people's atrocities of today. Even if there were, our people would definitely not have endured humiliation and carried a heavy burden, swallowing their voices and drinking tears, sitting and waiting for the powerful enemy to slaughter them. A thing must first rot before worms are born. A country must first attack itself before others attack it. The people of the country are complacent and wallowing in peace, poisoned by addiction, for the past thirty years as if it were one day. The country itself is constantly in a state of decay and collapse, constantly inviting the disaster of partition and destruction. Today's change, how can it be accidental? Therefore, anti-Japanese is passive, and national salvation is active. The old tune of weeping and wailing, running around and appealing, is not enough to resist Japan, and even more so, it is not enough to save the country. Today's matter, the only way is for the whole country, from top to bottom, to be of one heart and one mind, to grit their teeth, to endure the pain and tears, to maintain the spirit of struggle, to maintain the rising vigor, to lie on firewood and taste gall, to live together and teach, to end the past history of timidity, inertia, laziness, decline, and humiliation, so that we can open up a broad, bright, and brand-new future for our nation. We believe that under today's circumstances, all the people of our country should: (1) Recognize their own strength. Their own strength is true strength and is the most reliable. The "self" mentioned here refers to the individual in a small sense, and the entire populace in a broader sense. Individuals should recognize their own strength, and the masses should recognize their own strength even more. Today's matter, only we can save ourselves. Only the masses rising up can save the country. We have the strength to save ourselves. The masses have the strength to save the country. Relying on others is like relying on an iceberg, and it is difficult to survive. Individuals of our country, the entire masses, under today's circumstances, should all grasp their own strength and make a solid and effective struggle.</p>
<p>(2) First seek from oneself, then blame others. The perilous state of the country and the disasters were not sown in a day. The responsibility does not lie with one person alone. All the people of our country are sowers of evil causes. They should all be directly responsible for today's disasters. To go a step further, once the disasters have erupted, they should immediately seek to remedy them. To seek remedies, first seek from oneself, then blame others. Only when one has first fulfilled one's responsibilities can one blame others. If one merely shifts the blame to others, blames others, and is full of complaints, and ultimately just scolds and curses, what help is that to the country? If everyone can hold the determination to sacrifice themselves and make a difficult struggle, not talk empty words, and cherish responsibility, combining the great power of the 400 million people, what do we have to fear from the Japanese pirates? What do we have to fear from the current difficulties? (3) Use family, friends, and various relationships, in the form of small organizations, to supervise and encourage each other. Large organizations can be temporary but not permanent. When there are too many people, opinions are confused, and it is difficult to last. To maintain the spirit of struggle for a long time and maintain the rising vigor, so that it will never be replaced, it is necessary to unite in the form of small organizations, with a solid and effective goal, supervising and encouraging each other. Furthermore, fathers should instruct their sons, and brothers should instruct their younger brothers, so that everyone always has the heart to lie on firewood and taste gall, and always has the mind to be self-reliant and self-saving. With such a spirit, living together and teaching, I dare to say that within ten years, our country will be able to shake the world in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The above three points are all ordinary and unremarkable, but today's matter is not about talking high-sounding principles or firing empty cannons. Public sentiment is already at its peak. It is now the time to guide it onto the right track of intelligent reason and lead it onto the path of effective struggle. Being able to earnestly implement the above three points is enough to save our country and revitalize our nation. Otherwise, the momentum will be exhausted in one burst, followed by decline and exhaustion. After tearing hearts and weeping blood, there will be nothing to follow. The people of the country, do not forget the ridicule of the five-minute enthusiasm. Make a resolute will to make a solid, effective, and permanent struggle.</p>
<p>Domestic Important News Three</p>
<h3 id="e33">Yan Huiqing Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to Set Sail This Month (Nanjing) The newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Yan Huiqing, arrived in Nanjing on the 3rd in response to a telegram from the National Government and stayed at the Huilong Hotel. After attending the Special Diplomatic Committee in the afternoon, he went to the headquarters to meet Chiang Kai-shek at 3:00 PM. Because the foreign affairs issue is becoming increasingly serious, he was urged to take office in the United States as soon as possible so that the international community can deeply understand the truth about the Manchurian Incident. It is heard that Yan has decided to go to Shanghai in the coming days to purchase a ticket to leave the country. After returning to Nanjing, he will receive his credentials from the National Government and go to Tianjin. He will deal with the charitable affairs he has been handling over the years and deal with personal matters, and then he will go south to set sail, ensuring that he leaves within this month. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing spoke about the Japanese pirates in the Northeast with extreme sorrow. The whole country is united and aroused to resist foreign aggression. I believe that the first priority in foreign affairs is to have sincere unity within the country. After domestic unity, we will naturally receive special attention on the international stage. Regarding the Japan Incident, we must remain calm and composed on the one hand and make thorough preparations on the other hand. Since the enemy's invasion of us has been getting worse, we must not be without the preparation to resist. Resisting foreign aggression is the unanimous goal of the people of our country today. We must also pay attention to the rampant red bandits and the disasters in the country. All these cannot be neglected for a moment. For example, if there are several enemies in front of us at the same time and we cannot cope with them at the same time, we must strictly distinguish which is more important. While coping with one, we must also take care of the others to prevent them from expanding. Japan's ambition to invade our eastern provinces has been brewing for a long time. The so-called mainland policy is a consistent policy of that country. This action has a very thorough plan and steps, and it is by no means an accidental action. We believe that the countermeasures must be more cautious and appropriate. The Japanese government has now announced the withdrawal of troops. It is thought that Japan has a considerable status in the international community today and will not go back on its word and disregard its reputation. If so, Japan's international reputation will plummet and its reputation will be wiped out. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>The Liberal Party decides to support the new government. Unemployed workers in Scotland continue to cause disturbances. Reuters London, 2nd - British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke to the Labour Party today in the Seaham Harbour election district, but because MacDonald is the Prime Minister of the National Government, the local Labour Party no longer considers him a member. Therefore, those who listened to MacDonald's speech tonight were representatives of the Labour Party, not the entire party. The authorities in Seaham Harbour sent police officers to prevent disturbances, but there was no disruption of order. Many people watched outside the venue. When MacDonald arrived, some welcomed him, while others shouted loudly against him. When MacDonald entered the venue, everyone was silent. MacDonald was pale but determined. He rose to speak, briefly describing the causes of the national crisis and the necessity of cutting national expenditure. He then explained the attitude of his former colleagues. He spoke for more than an hour. The audience listened quietly, and sometimes the entire venue applauded. After MacDonald finished speaking, the secretary of the Labour Party branch declared that the Labour Party had previously decided to seek another candidate and would continue to do so. Thus, MacDonald was effectively rejected by his election district. On the same day, Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden gave the last speech of his political life in the House of Commons.

<p>Reuters London, 3rd - Prime Minister MacDonald arrived in London by train from Seaham Harbour at 5:55 this morning. He did not leave his room until 7:30 AM. After breakfast, he went to Buckingham Palace to meet the King and talked for an hour. He left at 10:15 AM and went to the countryside to rest.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 2nd - The Liberal Party in the Cabinet continued to negotiate with other parties today on the political program for the National Government to appeal to public opinion. Although a general election is inevitable, four cabinet members of the Liberal Party, including Samuel, disregarding the opposition of party leader George, have decided to support the National Government faction. However, other Liberal Party members in the government have not forgotten their commitment to free trade and want to break away from the tariff policy. These Liberal Party officials who do not have cabinet positions are willing to serve the National Government but find it difficult to agree to the Conservative Party's demand that the government's political program include the tariff policy. Today, Samuel went to Buckingham Palace to report everything to the King and then went to a meeting of Liberal Party members of Parliament. It is said that Samuel declared at the meeting that an election is inevitable. Reuters has learned that today's cabinet meeting was particularly late to allow the Liberal Party ample time to decide on their opinions on the political program. After discussion, the Liberal Party decided to allow Liberal Party cabinet members the freedom to negotiate the political program. According to a certain Liberal Party member, fifteen Liberal Party members in the National Government, with the exception of two or three, are willing to support British Prime Minister MacDonald. The cabinet met at 2:30 PM this afternoon, chaired by Conservative Party leader Baldwin, because Prime Minister MacDonald had gone to Seaham Harbour. The cabinet meeting lasted for about two hours and was suspended several times because Liberal Party cabinet members had to withdraw and discuss with their Liberal Party colleagues outside the cabinet. The cabinet meeting broke up without a result. It is said that Samuel and Reting are still requesting that the political program not explicitly mention tariffs, but the Conservative Party seems to be impatient. There will be no more cabinet meetings this week, and the matter will be resolved on Monday.</p>

<p>Istanbul Telegram, 2nd: Trotsky, the former leader of the Soviet Red Army who was exiled to Prinkipo Island, is now, according to reliable sources, under soft detention by the Turkish government on that island. There are guards stationed there, and no outsiders are allowed to approach. This news can be considered indirectly confirmed. The reason for the detention is said to be that Trotsky recently set up a shortwave radio station and frequently communicated with communists in Europe and Asia. The Turkish government believes that this violates his promise not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, hence this action. It is also said that it was instigated by the British authorities.</p>

Upon hearing this tragic news, our hearts are filled with anger. All Boy Scouts in this province held an anti-Japanese meeting in Guiyang on a frugal day. Over a thousand Boy Scouts attended.

<p>To all newspaper offices: We have recently received two telegrams from Deputy Commander Zhang Haohao, informing us that Japanese imperialists suddenly dispatched troops on the 19th of this month to forcibly occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Fushun, Yingkou, Andong, and other places. Upon hearing this tragic news, we are overcome with anger. Looking back at the history of national humiliation, Japanese imperialists have been responsible for the majority of the tragic events that have occurred in our country. They have always employed insidious conspiracies and vicious tactics to put our country in a state of annihilation. This has long been known to the world. Now, they have become even more brazen, disregarding justice, violating public law, and taking advantage of our country's natural and man-made disasters. Before numerous cases have been resolved, they suddenly occupied half of our Northeast, in order to achieve their ambition of annexing Manchuria. The nation is on the verge of collapse; what shame could be greater? All those with blood in their veins cannot but feel pain. We must urgently eliminate private grievances, cease internal strife, and gather all our strength to deal with Japanese imperialists and save the Party and the nation from destruction. We should also pool our wisdom and efforts to jointly resist foreign aggression and forever protect the territory of the Han people. Although I am unworthy, I am a soldier, and I cannot shirk my responsibility. I will lead my officers and soldiers, willingly serve as the vanguard, and jointly relieve the national crisis. Unless we achieve our goal, even if it means sacrificing our lives, we will never stop. This telegram is sent with indignation, for your clear understanding. Feng Qinzai, Commander of the Forty-second Division of the Army, bows respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Bizarre Situation in Jilin <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Reorganized into Commissioner's Office – Xi Qia Appointed as Commissioner by Acclamation</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Japanese troops entered Jilin City at 6:00 PM on the 21st. According to Japanese propaganda, there were a total of 2,700 troops led by Lieutenant General Tamon, commander of the Second Division. The people of Jilin were extremely frightened upon hearing that the Japanese troops were about to arrive. However, Xi Qia adopted a policy of non-resistance and secretly dispatched all troops stationed in the province to outside the city the night before to avoid conflict. Before the arrival of the Japanese troops, Japanese aircraft dropped leaflets, ordering merchants and residents to live and work in peace and not to avoid or fear them. When the Japanese troops arrived in Jilin, Xi Qia, along with Foreign Affairs Director Shi Luben and business representatives, welcomed them at the train station, shaking hands with Tamon. He then vacated the Provincial Government Chairman's office, welcoming Tamon inside to use it as headquarters. At the same time, Japanese troops were deployed to various locations throughout the city. All military and transportation agencies were occupied. Notices were issued to reassure the people, ordering merchants and residents to conduct business as usual. However, Tamon, considering that he would not be able to stay in Jilin for long, specially appointed Colonel Neoi as Jilin Garrison Commander, directing the Public Security Bureau Director to maintain Jilin's security. He also issued a proclamation, stating that no one should interfere with the actions of the Japanese troops, and violators would be executed. Meanwhile, after negotiations between Tamon and Xi Qia, they forced the withdrawal of troops and the surrender of weapons. Ultimately, due to practical difficulties, only a portion was surrendered. The rest were left because they were far from the province and did not pose a threat to security. The Japanese side then understood. However, during the negotiations, Xi Qia almost lost his life under the threat of guns, but he was able to turn the crisis into safety due to the mediation of Japanese Consul Ishiya, as well as the fact that Xi and Tamon had a teacher-student relationship (Xi graduated from military academy, and Tamon was an instructor at the time). After the weapons issue was resolved, Tamon ordered the advance towards Dunhua. As a result, the Jilin-Dunhua line also came under control, and Yanji and Dunhua became unified. Tamon returned to Changchun from Jilin on the 25th. Before leaving, he discussed with Xi the reorganization of the provincial government, which has now been implemented. It is named "Jilin Provincial Commissioner's Office." Xi Qia was elected as Commissioner by the leaders of agricultural, commercial, industrial, educational, and legal organizations to carry out all military and civilian affairs of the province. The Commissioner's Office has six departments: Military Affairs, Political Affairs, Education, Finance, Construction, and Industry, as well as a Police Affairs Department. There have also been major changes in personnel. Major General Staff Officer Guo Enlin was appointed Director of the Military Affairs Department. Sun Zhongwu, Director of the Construction Department, was transferred to the Political Affairs Department. Fu Chuntian, President of the High Court, was appointed Director of the Construction Department. Rong and Ma remain as directors of the Finance and Industry Departments, respectively. The Director of the Police Affairs Department also remained unchanged. The provincial government committee system was abolished. Zhang Qihai, the former Director of Civil Affairs, was re-appointed as Commissioner's advisor. Cheng Yun, the former Provincial Committee member, was appointed President of the High Court. Zhou Yuping, the Director of the Changchun Municipal Office, was transferred to the province and appointed as an advisor. His position was filled by Secretary Zhang Yanqing (Zhang Zhidong's nephew). Zhang Shuhan, the Director of the Yanji Municipal Office, was transferred to the province. His position was filled by Qi Bin, the Magistrate of Yanji County. The position of Yanji County Magistrate was filled by Zhang Zhiqin, the President of the Provincial Education Association. Ma Zhongyuan, the Magistrate of Changchun County, was transferred to the Commissioner's Office as secretary. Secretary Zhao Rumei was appointed to fill his position. Liu Zuyin, the Magistrate of Dunhua County, abandoned his post and fled. Liu Xingpei (Section Chief of the Harbin Office) was appointed to fill his position. Jiang Dafeng, the Chairman of the Public Works Association, was appointed Director of the Provincial Tax Bureau. Zhai Jingru was appointed Director of the Provincial Timber Tax Bureau. Zhao Rongsheng was appointed Acting Director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau. These are all the new appointments after the changes in the situation. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the situation in the provincial capital remains the same. The market is extremely sluggish, and the revenue of businesses is less than one-tenth of previous years. Most of the Japanese troops have returned to Changchun, but there are still some Japanese troops in the provincial capital, and their presence is quite secretive. No one knows their numbers. The following are the proclamations of the Jilin Provincial Commissioner's Office and the Provincial Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Proclamation of the Jilin Provincial Commissioner's Office: In view of the current circumstances, the provincial government is undergoing reorganization. All temporary political affairs of the Jilin Provincial Government will be handled by this Chief of Staff, who is also a member. This is for your information. Commissioner Xi Qia, September 26th, Republic of China Year 20. Proclamation of the Jilin Provincial Public Security Bureau: Regarding the matter of the proclamation, this bureau is now under the command of the City Garrison Commander, Colonel Neoi, to maintain security in the urban area. The following regulations are hereby stipulated, and all merchants and residents in the entire territory must comply with them and must not dare to violate them, lest they be punished. This is of utmost importance. 1. This bureau is under the command of Japanese Commander Colonel Neoi to maintain security in the city. 2.

The same applies to staff members who do not obey the appointment of this commander. Liu Guoquan, Director of the Jilin Provincial Public Security Bureau, September 23rd, Republic of China Year 20 (26th).</p>
<h3 id="e72">Japanese Army Plans <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>To Destroy the Hinggan Region</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Concentrated in Sipingjie – Tongliao and Taonan Occupied</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: After the Japanese army occupied Jilin and Changchun, they successfully contacted Yanji. Their main force then moved to Changchun. Later, due to the harsh environment in northern Manchuria, they did not dare to send troops to Harbin. Instead, on the 23rd, they sent a garrison unit led by Major Hayama to occupy the Sipingjie-Taonan Railway. The Sipingjie-Taonan Railway Bureau changed its flag to the Japanese flag. They continued to advance to Zhengjiatun, Tongliao, and other places. Garrison Commander Mori, citing the rampant banditry in Tongliao, dispatched another detachment. After the detachment arrived in Tongliao, it drove away more than 30 merchant households and occupied their houses to use as barracks. The streets and markets were devastated. Many wealthy people fled to Datu. On the 23rd, Japanese residents in Taonan and the South Manchuria Railway Taonan Office, citing the extremely unsafe local conditions and the danger to their lives, telegraphed the Japanese army to immediately send troops to protect them. Commander Mori then dispatched the Second, Third, and Fourth Companies of the Sixth Garrison Battalion stationed in Changchun, under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Uetaka, to Zhengjiatun to join the Hayama detachment. The two armies, totaling more than 500 men, carrying dozens of machine guns, occupied Taonan at 9:40 AM on the 25th. The local Garrison Commander's barracks and the reclamation army barracks were surrounded and occupied. Many personnel from various agencies fled to Qiqihar via the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway. At the same time, the Garrison Headquarters, which had recently moved to Changchun, also moved to Sipingjie. It is reported that the Japanese army in Taonan plans to attack the Taosuo Railway within days and enter Solun to destroy the Hinggan region's reclamation.</p>

<p>After the Pyongyang Aviation Team arrived in Shenyang, they established their Aviation Army Headquarters in Shenyang. They set up aircraft landing fields next to the Changchun Railway North and the Sipingjie Railway Station, each with two reconnaissance and bomber aircraft and 50 pilots. The Changchun airfield has already been completed, and the Sipingjie airfield is under repair.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied Kaiyuan, they searched for Magistrate Tong Yuchi. It is reported that Tong has patriotic ideas and often makes anti-Japanese remarks, so he is hated by the Japanese army. There are rumors that he was captured and shot by the Japanese army. In addition, the railway line between Linjiatai and Tongyuanpu stations on the Anfeng Railway was destroyed by bandits. The Japanese army stationed in Fengcheng falsely accused Chinese soldiers of doing it and arrested Zhang Yisan, the captain of the Fifth Squad of the county's Public Security Police, on the 23rd. His life or death is unknown. In addition, the Japanese army in Jilin, under the pretext of maintaining security and cracking down on undesirable elements, arrested dozens of anti-Japanese Korean residents.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Company transported 200 lower-level railway laborers from Dalian, Wafangdian, and other places and assigned them to the Jilin-Changchun, Sipingjie-Taonan, and Jilin-Dunhua railways to manage tasks such as moving tracks and hooking up cars. The railway business was completely taken over by the Japanese, and the Chinese employees of the various departments of the Jilin-Changchun Railway General Office could not continue to work as before, and have invisibly become disaster victims (27th).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Aircraft Bombing Incident <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Diplomatic Corps Has Reported to the League of Nations – Injured People Talk About Their Encounter with Danger</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Peiping Office for the Custody of Cases by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, formerly informed the Diplomatic Corps through a letter from the Peining Railway Bureau, requesting the prevention of Japanese military aircraft attacking Peining Railway passenger cars. Yesterday, it received a reply dated the 29th from the Spanish Minister Garrido, head of the diplomatic corps, stating, "Your office's letter stating the matter of the Peining Railway train being attacked by aircraft has been duly received. In addition to informing the ministers of all countries stationed in China, I have also telegraphed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of my country and the President of the League of Nations. This is a special letter in reply for your information." The office has already forwarded this to the Peining Railway Bureau for their information.</p>
<p>The following is a translation of an English letter from Tangsen, the Chief of the Accounting Department and General Manager of the Peining Railway, to Mr. Bonepe of the China-British Company, regarding the pursuit of passenger train No. 102 at Xinglongdian by Japanese aircraft on the 24th: At present, Japanese troops are quite provocative towards trains running from Shenyang. Japanese aircraft frequently fire upon these passenger cars, which are carrying civilians, many of whom are refugees. At around 11:00 AM on Thursday, I left Huangguantun to return to the Bureau. The official car was attached to the rear of the passenger car. Less than an hour after departure, approximately 34 kilometers away, the passenger car was attacked by Japanese aircraft. Many bullets penetrated the car, and the aircraft descended, almost directly above the official car. Upon stopping to inspect, it was found that three people had been killed and five had been injured (one of the injured subsequently died). Various traces of bullets entering the car could be seen on the passenger car. I am now reporting to the British Consul-General about the Japanese aircraft firing upon passenger train No. 102, which I was traveling on yesterday, because this action not only endangered the lives of myself and my family but also posed a threat to the lives of the German and Italian women who could not find seats on the car and were riding in the official car with me. Sincerely, Tangsen, September 26th.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the following are the accounts of the wounded Chinese, Jiao Jiahui and Zhang Lewen, who were injured in the Japanese aircraft shooting on that day: (1) Jiao Jiahui, 23 years old, from Tong County, is in the mechanical class of the aviation school. Due to the chaos, at 11:30 AM on September 24th, he boarded Peining Railway Train No. 102 to Tianjin. Because the car was crowded, he sat on the roof of third-class car No. 205, with about ten other people, including a woman and her servant. About half an hour after leaving Huangguantun, he saw a Japanese aircraft following the train. It first circled the train three times. When the train left Masanjia, the aircraft first fired three shots at the locomotive. Upon hearing the gunshots, I knew that the aircraft was firing. I shouted, "Lie down quickly!" At that time, the aircraft had flown very close to the roof of the car and opened fire with a machine gun. I felt a numbness in my finger and knew that I had been shot. There was a lot of bleeding. I hereby declare that there were no people in military uniform in the car. (2) Zhang Lewen, 36 years old, from Yangliuqing, is currently serving in the Deputy Officer's Office of the Second Army. On the 24th of this month, he took Peining Railway Train No. 102 from Shenyang to return to Tianjin. Because the car was crowded, he stood in the doorway of third-class car No. 205, between the front and rear cars, with about thirty other people, men, women, old, and young. A passenger named Li Fengnian was standing next to me and was talking to me. Li had a mother and a wife in the third-class car. I advised him to go inside to take care of them. Li said, "The car is crowded, it's better to be outside the car." There was also an old man over fifty years old, accompanied by a woman of about thirty, holding a girl of about two or three years old, and two sons, one three years old and one five years old, speaking with a Guanwai accent. Because it was too hot, they did not want to stand outside the car. Their mother consoled them. When the train left Huangguantun, two teams of Japanese aircraft were seen. One team flew east, and the other team flew west. One aircraft from the westward team followed train No. 102, first circling the train three times, only two or three feet away from the roof of the car. When the train left Masanjia, it opened fire with a machine gun on the front part of car No. 205, firing more than ten shots. The old man was shot and fell off the car. The woman, seeing the old man fall off the car, became frightened and loosened her grip, causing the girl in her arms to also fall off the car. The woman, seeing her daughter fall off the car, also followed and fell down. At the same time, the two sons, seeing their mother fall off the car, and the Japanese aircraft firing at the right side of the car, the passengers all dodged to the left, so they all fell to the ground from the left side of the car. At that time, the train was moving very quickly, and it is likely that they all died. A man was shot in the back of the head, his face covered in blood, and he immediately slumped and died. Li Fengnian was shot in the leg and ran into the car to see his mother and wife, but they had already fainted. I also went inside and saw Li's head hanging down and helped him support his mother and wife. Then I saw blood on the sleeve of my left hand and knew something was wrong. I touched it and knew that a bullet had pierced through. I also felt heat in my left ribs and felt a wound when I touched it. When the train stopped at Xinglongdian, I stood on the locomotive until Tianjin. Along the way, at Juluhe, Dahushan, Goubangzi, and Jinzhou, I saw Japanese military aircraft flying back from the west. I heard that the aircraft also dropped bombs at the aforementioned stations. At Jinzhou, a soldier from the Che Daying garrison was injured by the bombing. I reiterate that there were no people in military uniform in the car. From Xinglongdian to Juluhe, there were Japanese soldiers at each station. This statement is made.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Aftermath in the Shen City <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>All Affairs Come to a Standstill, Social Conditions Are Quite Different From Usual</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the incident in Shenyang, the people have been terrified, and the order of the city has been extremely chaotic. All affairs have come to a standstill. In addition to other government affairs, judicial and educational matters have not been carried out. Even the social conditions are quite different from usual. The various current conditions of the market are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>The Self-Defense Police Are Only Sufficient to Maintain Traffic; The Security of the Provincial Capital Is Undertaken by the Japanese Fengtian Military Police Corps</p>
<p>The security is undertaken by the Japanese Fengtian Military Police Corps, led by Military Police Major Mitani, with a staff of 80 people. The Wireless Telegraphy Administration is stationed with Captain Sugiura, who came to Shenyang from Fushun, commanding the city squad. The old site of the former Shangbu Martial Law Command is stationed with Captain Kawamoto, who came to Shenyang from Liaoyang, commanding the Shangbu squad. In addition, Feng Jingyi and Liu Zhaoxiang, the director and deputy director of the Fengtian Self-Defense Police Bureau, were entrusted by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to organize a self-defense police force of 600 people, unarmed, and assigned to the ten districts of the provincial capital, 60 people in each district, setting up posts at important intersections. However, this police force, due to its small number and lack of weapons, can only maintain traffic in fact, and it is still difficult to achieve the purpose of self-defense. Recently, there have also been discussions about businesses contributing funds for self-defense, abolishing the organization of 600 self-defense police officers, and forming a security team of 2,000 people to defend themselves separately. Some businesses have also sent people to jointly organize local self-defense teams, specializing in certain posts on certain streets, to supplement the lack. Daily, there are still Japanese military trucks patrolling.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Lives Are Compelled To Enter the City</p>
<p>The city of Shenyang, which was once known for its prosperous traffic, has become desolate since the incident. During the day, there are only a large number of pedestrians gathering on the streets, sighing and looking forward, no longer the busy and bustling scene of the past. After the 23rd, electric trams, Manchurian automobiles run by Russians, and buses, successively raised small Japanese flags and traveled through the city, and traffic gradually recovered. Others, such as covered wagons and rickshaw pullers, were forced by life to enter the city to solicit passengers, temporarily earning a few jiao for fares to make a living. The roads from the brick borders of the provincial capital, Biancheng Jiang, and from the countryside into the city are all passable, but those who come and go are mostly people who have moved to Guan Nei to avoid the war or seek a livelihood. Although the vehicles are constant, it not only cannot show the prosperity of traffic, but increases endless anxiety. By the 25th, the number of people moving to Guan Nei gradually decreased, because those who were going had already left, and those who were not going had temporarily stayed. Every day from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM is the time for traffic in the city.</p>
<p>Businesses Closed, Grain Merchants Refused to Accept Feng Tickets</p>
<p>After the incident, the shops in the market were closed all day, stopping their business. Except for a few smaller shops that reluctantly accepted Feng tickets to sell various goods, other shops such as grain and rice merchants and grocery stores uniformly refused to accept Feng tickets. During this period of shop closures, it is okay to postpone purchasing clothes, raw materials, and other items that can be delayed, but the indispensable food cannot be purchased once Feng tickets are refused and only cash is demanded, the people feel great difficulty. Because most of the general public have very few savings, and now they cannot go out to make a living, the few Feng tickets they have saved in the past few days are not even enough to buy porridge. Their difficult situation can be imagined. For a time, there was a great deal of commotion about the shortage of Feng tickets. All money shops closed their doors and stopped exchanging. As of the 25th, only the Japanese Taishan Qianhao in Daitongmen exchanged, where 78 Feng small coins could be exchanged for one silver ticket, 84 Feng small coins could be exchanged for one silver dollar, 2.7 silver dollars could be exchanged for one gold ticket, and 220 Feng small coins could be exchanged for one gold ticket. The Japanese military commander Honjo Shigeru also prohibited the transport of more than 100 cash silver dollars and gold bars and silver ingots out of the city.</p>
<p>Discussions About Reopening Shops Were Held Many Times, but No Results Were Achieved</p>
<p>The business community closed down from morning to night, like the old New Year's holiday, and the whole city looked bleak, causing endless emotion. Because of the issue of reopening shops, the Chamber of Commerce has held many discussions, but the reasons why the shops did not reopen were: first, they were afraid of losing a large amount of Feng tickets; second, if the security was not thoroughly resolved, they were afraid of robberies once they reopened. Therefore, after many discussions, there were no corresponding results. By the 23rd, only barbershops, bathhouses, restaurants, and food shops reopened. On the 24th and 25th, larger grocery stores, sauce shops, and noodle shops reopened, selling goods from window holes and accepting Feng tickets. They closed shop soon after reopening because they were afraid of robberies. Only the grain merchants closed their shops and did not reopen. Those who bought rice had to pay cash and transport it themselves. For old customers, the grain merchants sent people to transport it for them, but the price was not silver dollars. If there is no thorough way to maintain Feng tickets, the residents will soon suffer from food shortages. The price of porridge is uneven, about 1.6 to 2 silver dollars per dou, and white rice is about 3.2 to 4 silver dollars per dou. Bing is 1 jiao to 1 jiao 5 fen per jin, and fried bing is 8 fen. However, selling fried bing and other foods still reluctantly accepts Feng tickets, which is the savior of the people. Otherwise, if the grain merchants do not accept cash, most good people will become starving victims waiting for relief.</p>
<p>No Money to Repay Debts, Nor Debts to Collect</p>
<p>The merchants and people's debts have been in the habit of settling accounts during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but this unexpected incident is extremely unfavorable for collecting debts. Some debtors have moved to Guan Nei, and some have returned to their hometowns, causing creditors to run around all day and have sore legs, but most of the results are in vain. Even if the debtor still lives in the original place, but at this time of difficult livelihood, it is not easy to maintain, and the debtor has no money to pay. Seeing this situation, the creditor has no way to demand strictly. Therefore, the debts are stalled. Those who owe money have no money to repay, and those who collect debts have no debts to collect. The shops have been closed for a week, and there is still no clue. There are not many goods sold, and the shop assistants only consume money, resulting in unbearable losses. This is really the first difficult hurdle, creating an unprecedented deadlock. Walking through the market, there is only a sound of sighs coming out of the cracks in the door panels, hitting the eardrums.</p>
<p>Bandits Are Restless, Robbing Openly in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Since there are no armed police in the city, security has naturally become a major problem. In recent days, people who are slightly better off have closed their doors and do not go out. Those who are bustling on the streets are mostly people without assets. However, general bandits take the opportunity to be restless, and rob openly in broad daylight, especially at night, frightening the people every night. The recent robberies that have been learned are as follows: I don't know how many more have not been heard. (1) Two bandits broke into the home of a Yan family in Xiaonanguan during the day, each with a pistol, and robbed 200 silver dollars and 7 gold rings. (2) Two bandits came to the Liu family in Xiaobeiguan at night, one with a large gun and one with a bayonet, robbing a box gun and 1,200 silver dollars. (3) More than a dozen unarmed thugs in the Huang shop in Xiaobeiguan planned to knock on the door to rob, but the shop was not opened and they could not enter. They turned to Fuyuanji Grocery Store, robbed more than 100 silver dollars, and beat the owner. (4) Hundreds of rioters broke into the Fuxingchang Grain Merchant in Xiaonanguan during the day, snatching all the grain and flour and dispersing, causing great losses. (5) The Zhong house, a household living in Xiaonanguan, with a mother and daughter living their lives, two bandits broke in over the wall at night and were about to rob when Zhong's daughter fired a gun to scare them away. (6) Dozens of rioters in the old site of the Weidui Regiment Headquarters on Wuma Road in the industrial area took advantage of the vacancy to enter and take things, and were driven away by a Japanese patrol car, which shot and killed four people, and the rest dispersed. (7) Hou Xiaoshan, a resident of Xiaonanguan, was visited by more than 20 bandits in a car at night, who injured the watchman. Hou was shot and killed by the bandits, and Hou's grandson was also shot and killed. There are countless robberies and road robberies in the countryside. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Are Indignant at Japan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Federation of Industry and Commerce Decided to Donate War Funds</p>
<p>Philippines Correspondence: Zhang Changjie, chairman of the Tonghuai Federation of Industry and Commerce in Aroroy, Masbate Province, wrote a letter saying that he recently read in the newspaper that Japan had launched an unwarranted war against our country and dared to seize the main passes of our three eastern provinces by violent means and massacre our people. This kind of barbaric-minded Japanese imperialist wants to destroy China and then stop. Overseas Chinese here were all heartbroken and indignant when they heard about it. At 8 p.m. on the 23rd, a general meeting was convened to discuss the incident with Japan. About 100 people attended the meeting and resolved 41 articles. The main points are that if the central government formally declares war on Japan, the overseas Chinese here, if there are shops opened, are willing to extract the amount according to the business tax drawn by the Philippine government on their birthday to help the government's war funds. As for the labor sector, such as store employees, they are willing to sponsor half of their monthly salary to the government and half to support their families. Workers are also willing to contribute one-third of their wages to help the war funds. The proposal has been approved by the public. Although this is a drop in the bucket, it can also show the people's patriotism.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Representatives from Beijing and Guangdong Meet in Hong Kong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Communication: Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the Northeast, the voice of domestic peace has risen again. After the Beijing and Guangdong parties exchanged telegrams, Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, and Cai Yuanpei were sent south by the Beijing party to hold a meeting in Hong Kong. The Guangdong party sent Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and Li Junpei to Hong Kong to meet. Chen, Zhang, Cai, etc. arrived in Hong Kong yesterday on the Dutch wheel Zhishadanni at 9:05 a.m. The Guangdong party sent Fu Bingchang to Hong Kong to receive Chen, Zhang, Cai, etc., who are going south this time to seek peaceful reunification and unanimously resist foreign aggression. The rest who participated in the welcome in Hong Kong were Chen Fumu, Huang Jusu, Chen Zimu, Tang Wenqi, Mai Yingjun, Zhong Xizhuo, Zhuang Weigang, Shen Yi, Pu Liangzhu and other 20 people. The Central Government's Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, Mai Yingjun, informed the police authorities and sent a British detective and two Chinese police officers to the ship to follow and protect them. After the ship was inspected by a doctor, the welcomers boarded the ship around 10 o'clock to meet with Chen, Zhang, etc., and then took a small wheel directly to the fifth floor of the Peninsula Hotel to live. Wang and Sun came to Hong Kong yesterday afternoon from the province by special car. At about 5 o'clock, Chen Mingshu accompanied Fu Bingchang, Fu Bingkun, etc. to wait at the Kowloon Railway Station. At 6:10, the special car arrived. At that time, Chen was just at the tail of the car, and the car had passed in front of Chen. When Wang Jingwei saw Chen Mingshu, he jumped off the train station, stepped forward and shook hands with Chen, smiling and exchanging greetings. Wang said that he was so polite to greet him, and he really dared not do so. Chen said that Mr. Wang had been away for a long time. From this, it can be seen that the important party and state officials do not compare any gains or losses in this time of national crisis in order to unanimously resist foreign aggression. Then they went to the Peninsula Hotel together. At that time, Wang and Sun went by car, while Chen walked to the Peninsula Hotel. When Wang Jingwei left the train station, the reporter asked Wang about the main points because Wang's arrival was really related to peace. According to Wang, the mission of the brothers was because Mr. Chen, Zhang, and Cai had made a pre-agreement by telegram, so the national government sent Committee Member Sun Zhesheng, Li Wenfan and brothers to Hong Kong to meet to discuss the North-South peace conference and unanimously resist Japan. The matter is believed to be optimistic about the future. As for the content of this meeting, it is not convenient to tell you until after meeting with Mr. Chen, Zhang, and Cai. It is heard that the dignitaries held a secret meeting on the third floor of the Peninsula Hotel at 7 p.m. Those who attended were Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, and Cai Yuanpei from the Beijing side, and Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and Li Wenfan from the Guangdong side. The rest of the secretaries and deputy officers of both sides did not participate in the meeting. There were police detectives guarding outside, so the results of the discussions are still unknown. (Morning of the 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">14th Regular Meeting of the National Government <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The National Government held its 14th regular meeting on the morning of the 2nd. The committee members who attended were Chen Guofu, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Shao Yuanchong, Ding Weifen, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, and Dai Chuanxian. The chairman was Yu Youren. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) It was resolved that the resignation of Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting was approved, and Shi Zhaoji was specially appointed as Foreign Minister. (2) It was resolved that Yan Xishan was exempted from being wanted. (3) The Executive Yuan presented a case from the Hebei Provincial Government, stating that due to the military impact in the province, many important Qingxiang matters had not been implemented, and it was proposed to extend the Qingxiang deadline from October 1st for another three months in order to continue to carry out the work. The case was transferred to the Yuan for review and approval, and it was resolved to approve it. (4) It was resolved to announce and amend Article 11 of the Regulations on Short-Term Public Bonds for the Dredging of the Haihe River Project in Hebei Province. (5) The Examination Yuan presented a case submitted for review and deliberation on the case of Zhang Zhiyi, the former president of the Shandong Higher Court. It was found that the deceased president worked hard for the revolution, maintained legal rights, and was harmed by warlords. His loyalty to the law and his martyrdom were commendable. It is proposed to give his family an annual pension of 720 yuan at one-tenth of the monthly salary of 600 yuan for the Jianren position, and a one-time pension of 1,200 yuan to the family equivalent to two months' salary at the time of his last position. The case of whether it is appropriate is presented for review and implementation. In addition, Committee Member Ding Weifen made a statement on the spot that Zhang, the former president, maintained legal rights under the violence of the warlords in the past and was upright and unyielding. The people in the legal community deeply believed in him, but because of this, he was envied by the warlords, and he was arrested for designing and guiding the revolutionary army to attack Jinan to leak secrets, resulting in his death. The case should be given preferential treatment, and it was resolved to do so. (6) It was resolved that the resignation of Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, was approved.</p>

<p>The armed robbery case on Liuyuan Road: Zhu Deqing, secretary to lawyer Gu Jirong of Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, met Zhu Qiuying, a Suzhou woman, at Wing On Company and fell in love. When the woman returned to Suzhou, she told Zhu that if it was convenient to come to Suzhou, he could go to No. 33, Shiqi Lane. The day before yesterday (2nd), Zhu came to Suzhou to collect debts and stayed at No. 18, Suzhou Hotel. He immediately ordered the porter to call the woman. Unexpectedly, the woman did not come, but at 8 p.m., several men dressed as warriors came and dragged Zhu out. After passing through a remote place on Liuyuan Road, they snatched 200 yuan of banknotes from Zhu's body, stabbed Zhu's face in six places with a knife, and stuffed Zhu's mouth with mud before leaving. Zhu snatched a symbol with the words "Lai Keying, company commander of the 1st Battalion, 1st Regiment, 4th Brigade, 2nd Division of the Army" written on it and reported the case to the police station for investigation. Zhu is now being treated at Guangci Hospital. The content of the case may involve other issues. A madman confesses to being a kidnapper: In the case of Wei Tingrong's kidnapping in Shanghai, the criminals have been arrested repeatedly. The day before yesterday (2nd), a Shen Ruirong suddenly appeared on Zhimen Road and bowed to Luo Wei, who used to be the company commander of the 2nd Guards Division, saying that he was the initiator of Wei Tingrong's kidnapping and collaborated with Zhao Weiming. Now that Zhao has been arrested, he came to Suzhou to surrender. Luo immediately pointed to the post police of the 3rd and 4th sub-bureaus to bring him to the 3rd sub-bureau of public security. After questioning by Bureau Member Sheng, the person was incoherent and seemed to be insane, and there was no one named Zhao Weiming arrested in Suzhou. However, since the case involved kidnapping, the truth should be investigated, so the case was transferred to the General Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>The guards are stationed in Wuxi, Chengjiang, and Jiangyin</p>
<p>As an important fortress of the Yangtze River, there have always been troops stationed in the area. At this time when Japanese warships are causing havoc everywhere, the defense is even more important. Director of Pacification Zhang Zhijiang is therefore extremely concerned about the defense of the Yangtze River. In addition to strictly ordering the troops in Nantong to pay attention to the port defense, he also reported to the General Command for verification. Yesterday morning (3rd) at 3:30, Feng Shengfa, the head of the 5th Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division of the Guards stationed in Beijing, was ordered to lead the 2nd and 3rd battalions to Wuxi by car. He temporarily stationed near the station. After the 1st Battalion arrives in Wuxi, he will go to Cheng for training this afternoon to consolidate the defense of the Yangtze River. The county government ordered the county public security bureau to rent all the boats and ships to prepare for the trip to Cheng.</p>
<p>Telegrams Request the Return of Seized Paper Materials</p>
<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, for the case of the county's Tongtaisheng Paper Shop, which shipped American Western paper, colored glossy paper, and Chinese printed paper, etc., in six bundles loaded by Changzhou Derunxiang Paper Shop; and Fuyuanxiang, which loaded eight pieces of British, American Western paper, and Chinese printed paper loaded by Derunsheng; and Yitang, which shipped four pieces of 20 reams of British Conscience brand colored glossy paper loaded by Liyang Derunsheng, which were all seized by the county's anti-Japanese association after passing through Xiyi, yesterday specially telegraphed the county chamber of commerce to transfer a letter to the anti-Japanese association to verify and release the goods as soon as possible to maintain the hardship of the business. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, approved the telegram and immediately transferred a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for verification and return. I do not know whether the association will approve it. The Strange Drama of Mourning Procession in the Anti-Japanese Voice</p>
<p>The mother of Tian Shijie, a military adviser to the National Government, Ms. He, passed away on September 8th. Yesterday was the day of the funeral. The ceremonial guards were extremely grand, and those who held the rope were all dignitaries. However, there were countless banners in the ceremonial guards, which was quite eye-catching, such as "National Government String Orchestra," "Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Department Water Police Team," "Wuxi County Police Team," etc., which were quite noticeable. When the procession reached the area of Gongyuan Road, a few young people suddenly shouted slogans, saying, "The government is the people's government, the string orchestra of the National Government should not be used as a tool for private use, and the police are raised with the people's fat and ointment to protect the local people, not to send funerals for private individuals," and so on, and earnestly explained to the police. When the procession reached the entrance of Qitai Stack on Tongyun Road, the 60 members of the string orchestra were all moved and voluntarily withdrew, and all the banners were also taken away by the young people. In this anti-Japanese national salvation voice, a glimpse of the people's morale can also be seen.</p>

<p>The Daoist Temple Homicide Case: Opening the Coffin for Examination</p>
<p>Hu Ayao, a sheep butcher in Qitu of the county's Daoist temple, bought a dead cow ten days ago and planned to sell the map. Unexpectedly, Wu Degen, a cowherd living in Shiqitu, whose brother Li Ketu wanted to make a profit, went to extort money, resulting in an argument between the two sides. Ayao, who had a pre-existing injury, could not resist and died immediately upon returning. Wu's wife reported to the village chief Lin Zaixi, who arrested the murderer and sent him to the First District Office to be escorted to the county for investigation. Later, because the corpse's family did not want to pursue the matter, their relatives, such as Zhang Juncai, mediated and provided compensation. Yesterday, just as they were submitting a plea for settlement, several people surnamed Lu in the area accused them of privately settling a homicide case. The county detective reported to County Chief Shen, who appointed Judge Xu Ziqin to go to the countryside to open the coffin for examination today (2nd). The result was that although Hu Ayao was beaten at the time, the cause of his death was due to shortness of breath. Therefore, the county government has already summoned a group of witnesses to await sentencing. Meeting of the Anti-Japanese People's Congress</p>

<p>Exchange Abolishes East Exchange Standard</p>
<p>Implemented Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>The city's Commodities Exchange and Gold Exchange have generally used the East Exchange as the standard for exchange rates. For twenty years (before that, the Chinese market used British gold as the standard), the rise and fall of China's finances were controlled by the Japanese. The losses from this cannot be calculated. Since the Japanese army occupied the eastern provinces, all industries have implemented economic sanctions against the Japanese side. However, the East Exchange still followed the old practice. It is now known that, starting yesterday, the two exchanges will not use the East Exchange as the standard for margin exchange, but will change to using the rise and fall of the US dollar as the standard, thoroughly implementing economic sanctions.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods expressed that the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods convened all members and comrades in the domestic goods industry to discuss 14 measures for resisting Japan and saving the country. In addition to implementing them separately, they released a declaration and important telegrams yesterday. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration: To all compatriots in the country, the Japanese military's atrocities, occupation of the Northeast, disregard for justice, and disruption of East Asian peace are implementing their ambition to invade the eastern provinces, trampling on our land, killing our compatriots, persecuting our officials, plundering our property, and being barbaric, cruel, and inhumane. This is intolerable! Our country is in the midst of floods and civil war, unable to resist, losing territory, relying on the Kellogg-Briand Pact without effect, appealing to the League of Nations without salvation, and is about to fall into national subjugation! Compatriots, time is pressing! The situation is critical! National disaster is upon us! Rise up and save ourselves! In the midst of non-resistance, seek resistance strategies. The only way to resist the armed aggression and vicious actions of Japan is for all 400 million compatriots to unite as one, stand on a single front, absolutely boycott Japanese goods, impose economic sanctions, and insist on non-cooperation until the end. Within three to five years, Japan will inevitably face economic bankruptcy and surrender. Our patriotic compatriots must promote domestic goods and develop local products. All necessities of life, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, must only be domestic goods. Heads can be broken, blood can flow, bodies can be killed, but the determination to boycott Japanese goods cannot be bent. Non-violent resistance is sufficient to defeat the brutal Japanese and promote the patriotic spirit of our Chinese nation, showing the self-defense force of our compatriots to save the country. Compatriots, the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual. The Japanese invasion and occupation of the Northeast will bombard our great mountains and rivers throughout the country. If we do not work together and unanimously implement the negative boycott of Japanese goods and the positive promotion of domestic goods that the association has been doing for eleven years, national subjugation is not far off. Compatriots, awaken your conscience! Rather be a patriotic spirit than a slave of a conquered nation. Boycotting Japanese goods and promoting domestic goods are sufficient to resist Japan and save the country. Patriotic compatriots, while there is still breath, resist Japan and save the country with unwavering determination. Strive to save China! This is the time! We, the people of the domestic goods industry, are not talented, but we vow to be the vanguard. Our 400 million compatriots will be the rearguard, defeating the brutal and vicious Japan, avenging the country, and defeating the Japanese aggressors for the country. This declaration is made in all sincerity.</p>
<p>Telegrams: (1) Please send troops to resist Japan (titles omitted). Taking advantage of the rampant communist party and continuous floods in our country, Japan suddenly used vicious and brutal military actions to invade and occupy Shenyang, with the intention of invading Mongolia and Manchuria and destroying China, killing people, looting property, disregarding justice, and being inhumane. This is intolerable! The people of the country are filled with righteous indignation, their blood has not cooled, they are destroying their homes to relieve the national crisis, and they are joining the army. The responsibility of every individual is temporarily the rearguard. Rather be a Chinese spirit than a Japanese slave. The association respectfully follows the resolution of the 4th meeting of the 11th session of representatives, submitting a request to the government to concentrate its forces and declare war on Japan in order to save the country. We especially record this and earnestly request your government to quickly assemble the national revolutionary soldiers and instruct the two commanders-in-chief, Chiang and Zhang, to send troops to fight Japan in order to save the national crisis (remainder omitted). (1) Please Chiang and Zhang send troops to resist Japan (titles omitted). The brutal Japanese are acting recklessly, invading and occupying the Northeast, with the intention of annexing Mongolia and Manchuria and destroying China. This is intolerable! We earnestly request that you, with your spirit of revolution and bravery to kill the enemy, lead the national army to defend the country, resist Japan, save the country, attack Tokyo, and wipe out the Japanese invaders. While the people of the country still have breath, we vow to be the rearguard (remainder omitted). (1) Please stop the war between Beijing and Guangdong to save the country (above omitted). Unfortunately, our country has suffered from years of civil war, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, causing suffering to our people. The brutal Japanese took the opportunity to invade and occupy Shenyang, with the intention of annexing the Northeast and destroying China. The people of the country have not lost their blood and are filled with grief and anger. With the spirit of patriotism and saving the country, we vow to be the rearguard. National disaster is upon us, and every individual has a responsibility. The association, in accordance with the resolution of the 4th meeting of the 11th session of representatives, telegraphed a request to both sides to stop the war and resist Japan to save the country. We earnestly request that you consider the difficulty of establishing the country by the Premier, the glory of the revolutionary history, the suffering of the people in the civil war, and the hope for peaceful unification, respect public opinion, eliminate political differences, quickly stop the war, and work together to resist Japan in order to save the national crisis and ensure the people's livelihood (remainder omitted). (1) Please punish the officials who lost the national territory (above omitted). The Japanese military's atrocities in invading and occupying Shenyang were brutal, disregarding justice, and involved organized armed aggression and orderly and brutal actions. It was by no means a hasty move. However, the military and political officials in Shenyang responsible for defending the territory disregarded the country's territory, the people's lives and property, and retreated without resistance. There was no preparation beforehand and no relief afterwards. What was their intention? What was their responsibility? The association, in accordance with the resolution of the 4th meeting of the 11th session of representatives, requests that the national government severely punish the officials who failed in their duties in Shenyang. We specifically record this and telegraph it to your government, requesting that you handle it impartially and strictly enforce the law in order to uphold the law and appease the people (remainder omitted).</p>
<p>Yan Yuheng's Speech</p>
<p>Japanese Atrocities in the Northeast</p>
<p>Advocates Refusing Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>Thorough Economic Sanctions Against Japan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Education for National Salvation Federation jointly invited Mr. Yan Yuheng, the General Secretary of the Liaoning YMCA, to give a speech at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2 PM on the true situation of Japanese atrocities in the Northeast. He recounted the government's failure to take precautions beforehand and its adoption of a non-resistance policy afterwards, leading to the loss of thousands of miles of territory and irreparable damage. What is most distressing is the seizure of our aircraft for use in bombing vehicles on the Beining Railway. The Liaoning Zhaoxin Industry Company, founded by Du Chongyuan over many years of hard work, was also completely destroyed. Mr. Yan also expressed his opinion on negotiations, advocating refusing direct negotiations, compensating our losses, and establishing the fundamental security of our country's Northeast. He also said that, in order to achieve this goal, the people must unite against foreign aggression, thoroughly implement economic sanctions, and vigorously carry out military training. After Mr. Yan finished his speech, Chairman Zheng Xigu introduced Professor Zhang Weishu of Northeastern University to speak on the origins of the Japanese invasion and occupation of Manchuria, with passionate and indignant words that made the two thousand audience members express their anger.</p>
<p>Zhang Weishu Narrates</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Seriousness of the Occupation of Various Railways in the Northeast <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Professor Zhang Weishu of Northeastern University, who recently came to Shanghai from Shenyang, described the Japanese occupation of the Northeast. Mr. Zhang also worked in the traffic bureau in Northeast and he was a committee member of the Northeastern Railway Net Committee. He is very familiar with the situation of the Northeastern Railway. According to him, the Japanese have long planned the invasion of the eastern provinces, but the rapid initiation was threatened by the railway policy in the Northeast. He negotiated with China, but China delayed and ignored it. Now the joint transportation of various railways in the Northeast has been completed and the Huludao port construction is progressing smoothly, so the two trunk lines are completed. The South Manchuria Railway will be in vain, so they disregard justice and use force to destroy it. Now, the Japanese occupied ten railways in the Northeast, including Ji Hai, Shen Hai, Si Tao, Ji Chang, Ji Dun, Tao Ang, and six railways, with a total value of no less than 100 million. Moreover, according to newspaper reports, they are actively repairing the tracks between Ji Dun and Tianbaoshan in order to connect the Ji Dun and Tian Hui railways. If Ji Hui is completed and Qingjin Port is used as the export, even if the political power is handed over to China in the future, the Northeast will be as if it does not exist. Mr. Zhang is staying at the Guangtailai Hotel in Shanghai and is expected to stay for about a week. The universities plan to invite him to give lectures. It is heard that he has accepted the invitation of Guanghua University to lecture on the Northeastern issue today.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Iron Blood Corps</p>
<p>Someone Initiates the Formation in the City</p>
<p>Since the Japanese military's atrocities against our Northeast occurred, the whole country has been filled with grief and indignation. Resisting Japan and saving the country is what everyone desires. However, the atrocities did not happen overnight, so there must be a firm will and sustained effort to thwart the brutality of the Japanese and save our country from the brink of collapse. Recently, many people in the city have initiated the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Ten-Person Corps. The declaration and articles of faith are as follows: Our declaration: The fierce and brutal Japanese imperialists have occupied our Northeast, robbed us of countless treasures, and massacred countless of our compatriots, and have not stopped even now. Even if it stops temporarily, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not happen again in the future. We do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation. We want to rise up and fight them to the death, not only to save the country, but also to save ourselves, to save our race. We have made up our minds, no more empty talk, no more half-heartedness, no more living in a drunken dream. We want to clench our teeth, be patient, realistic, and constantly follow our sacred articles of faith, and use the conscience and perseverance of each of our ten people to defeat the fierce and brutal Japanese imperialists who are oppressing us, robbing us, massacring us, wanting to destroy our country and exterminate our race. Our articles of faith are: (1) Do not buy Japanese goods; (2) Do not work for the Japanese; (3) Prepare for war against Japan (this article will be changed if you are in the military: rather die fighting the Japanese than surrender); (4) Promote the organization of the Ten-Person Corps. Our oath is: I solemnly swear that I will use my conscience and perseverance to implement our articles of faith: (1) Do not buy Japanese goods; (2) Do not work for the Japanese; (3) Prepare for war against Japan; (4) Promote the organization of the Ten-Person Corps. Never forget, never relax. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe sanctions of this corps. Our hope is that, from the day the first Ten-Person Corps is established, each person will form a Ten-Person Corps within ten days, for a total of one hundred members. Then, within ten days, each person will form another Ten-Person Corps, for a total of one thousand members. From this promotion, the organization will grow tenfold and the members will grow tenfold every ten days. In less than three months, it will be widespread throughout the country. The first organization of the corps was solemnly established in the energetic morning light at 7 AM yesterday, with an old gentleman presiding over the oath-taking ceremony. The ceremony was extremely solemn and tragic. There is no leader, no burden, and no organization. The corps is actively developing the organization and plans to hold a joint gathering of one hundred people on National Day to discuss practical methods for resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>

(2) The Great China Match Company sent a letter requesting instructions on how to establish an inspection team, but the industry has not organized an association and is not a member of the Chamber of Commerce. It was resolved to reply that, since the industry has no trade association, it is not convenient to organize an inspection team according to the association's general rules. If any colleagues privately import Japanese goods, they can report them to the association or the Anti-Japanese Association as much as possible. (3) It was reported that Zhang Xingtao, chairman of the Hardware Industry Association, was sheltering Japanese goods, requesting sanctions. It was resolved: (1) To warn Zhang Xinghai; (2) To require the industry to organize an inspection team within three days of receiving the letter and report the organization situation for record; (3) To require the industry to seal all unregistered Japanese goods and Western goods sold by Japanese firms immediately.

It was resolved: (1) To reply to the industry association to quickly send personnel to seal the goods; (2) To send a letter to the three companies, stating that they must not refuse when the Department Store Industry Association comes to seal Japanese goods. (5) The Lighter and Gacha Industry Association sent a letter asking whether all items other than cotton seeds are prohibited from being sold to the Japanese, requesting a reply immediately. It was resolved that all items are prohibited, and a letter was sent to reply to the association. (6) The Blacksmith Industry Association sent a letter offering a method of contributing to the boycott of goods, requesting adoption. It was resolved to reply that it has been approved. (7) The Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association sent a letter requesting clarification on three points. It was resolved: (A) Each team will formulate its own detailed rules for handling affairs within the team; (B) Inspectors will naturally receive rewards for finding Japanese goods. The reward method will be determined separately; (C) All factories in the industry can be inspected, but they must have a certificate. (8) The Steel and Tin Industry Inspection Team was named the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Copper and Tin Industry," which does not comply with the name stipulated in Article 2 of the general rules. Should it be corrected to show uniformity? It was resolved to reply to the association to correct the name to the Steel and Tin Industry Inspection Team. (9) Articles 10 and 11 of the general rules have provisions for rewards and punishments, but the regulations have not yet been formulated. Now, due to the tense anti-Japanese atmosphere, these regulations should be implemented urgently. Please decide on the drafting personnel and scope. It was resolved to appoint Qiu Liangyu, Pan Yisan, and Ye Jiaxing to draft the reward and punishment regulations. (10) It was reported that Zhu Chunbo, owner of the Zhenhua Lishi Umbrella Factory, colluded with Japanese merchants to privately import Japanese goods. How should he be handled? It was resolved to hand it over to the investigation team. (11) Representatives from the medicine, ginseng and bird's nest, cotton cloth, and mercerized cotton weaving industries requested that the Anti-Japanese Association be sent a letter requesting that the registered Japanese goods be investigated as soon as possible, and that a pass be issued for the investigated Japanese goods to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. It was resolved to forward it to the Anti-Japanese Association. (12) The Timber, Noodle Shop, and Grain Shop Associations sent a letter stating that they have established an inspection team, requesting filing for record.

<h3 id="e90">Sugar Industry Insiders Privately Smuggling Enemy Goods <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Trade Association issued a notice yesterday, alerting the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association that a Japanese Goods Inspection Team has been established. Yao Ashun and others have been appointed as inspectors to conduct strict inspections at various docks. To alert fellow traders, an urgent notice was issued yesterday and posted within the market. The notice is excerpted below: Regarding the notice, since the Korean incident occurred, the people of the nation have been outraged by the brutality of the Japanese and have taken economic action to sever ties. The association passed a resolution in the general meeting to unanimously boycott them. Subsequently, it was heard that some unscrupulous elements in the industry, who only care about profit and disregard patriotism, are still secretly selling Japanese sugar. The association has repeatedly issued warnings to promote awareness. Now, according to a letter from the National Protection Anti-Japanese Iron Blood Group, there are still those in our industry who are colluding with Japanese ruffians to privately smuggle enemy goods. Although these facts may be the actions of Japanese merchant comprador, our industry has failed to be fully firm in its determination to completely abandon Japanese sugar trade, resulting in this severe suspicion, and incurring warnings from the outside world, which is extremely distressing. The association's Japanese Goods Inspection Team has been established, and Yao Ashun has been appointed as the chief inspector of various docks, leading the inspectors to carry out inspections. At this time of national crisis, when the nation is facing peril, all Chinese people should unite against the enemy, automatically boycott, encourage themselves and others, and not lose the patriotic blood sincerity. It is hereby solemnly announced again, and earnestly warned, hoping to inspire conscience and deeply realize that if anyone turns a blind eye and secretly deals in Japanese sugar again, once discovered, the most severe sanctions will be imposed, without any favoritism. It is hoped that all colleagues in the industry will investigate openly and secretly to supplement the association's shortcomings, and the national salvation movement depends on it. The Anti-Japanese Association warns Kui Yanfang.</p>

According to reports, when the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred, you organized a fish company specializing in selling Japanese fish. The company's business is still ongoing. Considering that you are a design committee member of this association, your patriotism is always ahead of others, and you usually speak generously, how can you bear to shamelessly befriend the enemy and work as a tool for the Japanese? Therefore, a special letter is sent to advise you to express your attitude immediately, and publicly report the recent business situation of the fish company to correct public opinion and quell anger. It is hoped that you will take note and reply."</p>

<p>Important Letter from the Silk and Satin Printing Industry. The preparatory committee of the Silk and Satin Printing Industry Association sent letters to the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association and all silk shops in the city to resist Japanese printing factories, saying, "Dear Sirs, the Japanese soldiers have invaded and occupied our East Province, and all Chinese people are deeply resentful. The Japanese have been scheming and doing everything they can. Today's violent aggression is obvious, and their economic aggression, which is enough to dominate our country and lead us to our death, has been going on for decades, without a day, an hour, or an event, without displaying its ambition and extending its power. Although the people of the nation know this clearly, they do not pay attention to it, and they know it deeply but do not plan for prevention. There are even some heartbroken and mad people, greedy and unscrupulous people who collude with each other and work as tools for the Japanese. They are truly slaves and willing to be running dogs of Japanese imperialism. It has been found that there are many silk and satin printing factories in the city that are purely operated and opened by Japanese merchants. There are also many joint ventures between Japanese and Chinese, posing as Chinese merchants. The Japanese business is very developed, taking away almost all of the original position of our country's printing business, so that our industry has declined in the past three years and is in an unspeakable state. The reason is that the Chinese people have accumulated habits and are happy to see Japanese printing, which is not a way to love the country and strengthen the people. It is hoped that your industry will promote domestic products and not lag behind others. At this time of Japanese soldiers' atrocities, occupying our territory, and the life and death of the nation, your industry is particularly enthusiastic about the patriotic movement. It is hoped that your shop will entrust all silk and satin printing to the factories of our association members in the future, and never enter Japanese factories again. In this way, the silk and printing industries will be determined to resist the Japanese invasion. Sincerely informing you, hoping for your public review and expressing sympathy."</p>

The Baoshan Road Fifth District Public Security Bureau was suddenly attacked by dozens of people yesterday evening, and patrol officer Liu Guoshu was beaten and injured. According to the Public Security Bureau, the incident occurred at around 6:30 PM. More than 30 people suddenly came to the outside of the district station, holding banners in their hands. The leading persons, wearing suits, invaded the station, shouting words like "Down with You Bolu" and knocking hard on the table in the preliminary hearing office. At that time, Patrol Officer Liu Guoshu was in the patrol officer's room next to the preliminary hearing office. He went out to investigate after hearing the sound, but the comers grabbed Liu without asking any questions, dragged him out of the station, and beat him at the entrance of Tianjili. After the incident, they scattered without a trace. It was also heard that when the incident occurred, Public Security Bureau Director Chen was also in the station because he was inspecting in Zhabei and witnessed the incident. The patrol officer was severely beaten and injured. The pistol he was carrying and 17 bullets were taken away by the crowd.

<p>Inquiry into You Bolu and Others</p>
<p>Conflicting Statements from Chang Ching Police Witnesses</p>
<p>Another Deceased Identified as Cai Yongfang</p>
<p>Sixth District Party Headquarters Requests Severe Punishment</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei Baoshan Road police shooting civilians, Mayor Zhang sent representatives Yu Hongjun and others. After a detailed investigation the previous day, yesterday starting from 10:00 AM at the Municipal Government, Party Headquarters representative Wu Kaixian, Municipal Government representative Yu Hongjun, and Garrison Headquarters representative Jiang Yi, etc., interrogated You Bolu of the Fifth Public Security Bureau and other Chang Ching police, inquiring about the circumstances of the incident. They also summoned Sixth District Party Headquarters representative Yang Youren and related witnesses to inquire about everything. However, the statements from various Chang Ching police and related witnesses differed. The inquiry continued until around 2:00 PM, and as there were no results, they adjourned and decided to continue the inquiry today. After the three representatives completed their inquiry, they met with Mayor Zhang to report. In the afternoon, they revisited the Public Security Bureau to check on the detention of You and others.</p>
<p>Another Deceased Identified The Shanghai Packing Industry Workers' Union representative stated that the Fifth District Public Security Bureau Chief You Bolu brutally killed two compatriots. One was already claimed by family, but the other's name was unknown. It is now known that the deceased's name was Cai Yongfang, 22 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang. He worked as a bookbinder at Shiyongji Binding Shop in Xingyeli, Xibao Road. He was a member of the Shanghai Packing Industry Workers' Union. He had been suffering from an eye ailment for several days, and on the 1st of this month, at 8:00 PM, he went to a bathhouse at the south end of Qiujiang Road to bathe. After bathing, he returned to work and passed by the Fifth District Office. At that moment, District Chief You shouted for the police to open fire, and he was tragically killed by bullets. This person was usually honest and kind, and well-liked by his colleagues. He had worked at Shiyongji for many years. His family has now been notified. His father is a shop assistant in a rice store in his hometown. He was an only son, who married last September but has no children yet. Now he has met with this calamity.</p>
<p>Mother of Shen Wanlin Cries In the case of the Fifth District Police Station officers killing people, yesterday a woman named Shen Yan, mother of the deceased, filed a petition with the local court, stating that one of the deceased was her son, Shen Wanlin, 18 years old. He was already trying to avoid the area when the officers opened fire, resulting in him being shot in the back and dying. He was innocent and suffered an undeserved fate, and she requested justice. Prosecutor Yang opened a preliminary hearing. The woman stated that the police district chief and officers should be severely punished according to the law. The judge stated that District Chief You Bolu and six officers are currently being investigated by the Public Security Bureau, and after the case is handed over, it will be handled according to the law. The judge stated that her son's body has already been examined and she can claim it. The woman repeatedly requested justice, and the judge repeatedly consoled her before she left in tears.</p>
<p>Sixth District Party Headquarters' Petition The Sixth District Party Headquarters held a plenary meeting of district party members specifically for this matter and passed a resolution to petition, stating, "Petition regarding the Fifth District Chief You Bolu ordering the firing of guns and killing of innocent people, requesting that the petition be forwarded to the Supervisory Committee to expel You from his probationary party membership, and further request the municipal government to swiftly sentence You to capital punishment, confiscate his family property, and compensate the injured and deceased, to quell public anger and maintain party discipline. We have investigated that the current situation is extremely serious, and anti-Japanese sentiment is growing stronger. Therefore, the military and police responsible for local security, as well as patriotic individuals, should stand on the same front and demonstrate a spirit of cooperation in resisting aggression. This is a revolutionary understanding that should not be ignored. Unexpectedly, Fifth District Chief You Bolu, as a probationary party member and responsible for public security, should consider how to lead the public and work hard in the face of anti-Japanese national salvation, so as not to fail the central government's profound intentions for resisting Japan. However, the reality is the opposite, which pains us greatly. We will now briefly describe the circumstances (this paragraph has already been seen in yesterday's newspapers, the same as what was described by Yang Youren and Feng Xiancheng, members of the Sixth District Party Headquarters standing committee, so it is omitted). Based on the above facts, it is known that You Bolu's arrogance and violence are undeniable. The people gathered and refused to disperse, simply wanting to understand the outcome of the punishment of the offending police officers. Whether there were malicious individuals mixed in, we dare not say, but the people were all motivated by patriotic fervor, and even if they slightly overstepped the bounds of propriety, there was no reason to open fire and kill them. Moreover, according to eyewitnesses, the people did not rush into the Fifth District, nor did they take any action to fire first. Therefore, under such circumstances, the public security chief, no matter how violent, had no right to open fire freely. Furthermore, before the firing of guns, the district executive committee members, Tang and Yang, were still talking to him. If the situation was truly urgent, he should have consulted with them to seek a proper solution. In addition, the Fifth Railway Regiment fire brigade and other parties could have been called for assistance, but You did not heed this. Thus, relying solely on his own anger, he used the people as target practice. The pain of this matter is beyond measure. It has already been brought up at the forty-first executive committee meeting, and everyone believes that if this kind of matter is not severely punished, then the party's faith in the people will be completely lost. Therefore, the following resolutions were made: (1) Request that the Council forward the petition to the Supervisory Committee to expel You from his probationary party membership. (2) Request that the municipal government sentence You Bolu to capital punishment, confiscate his family property, and compensate the injured and deceased, etc. These matters are on file. We hereby list the facts and respectfully request your review and strict execution. We are awaiting your orders. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>You Bolu to be Sent to Court Yesterday, the reporter visited Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng to inquire about the handling of You Bolu's case. Chen replied that the case is currently being jointly investigated by the Party, government, and military to determine the truth. You Bolu is currently being held at the Public Security Headquarters and will be handed over to the court tomorrow for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Norwegian Merchant Sues for One Hundred Gold Pieces All Donated to Disaster Relief Agency The Yinheng Foreign Goods Firm previously violated a contract to purchase goods from a Norwegian merchant. The Norwegian merchant hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a lawsuit for damages with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate for losses of over 700 taels of silver. Yinheng argued that the violation was due to a breach of contract and filed a counterclaim, also requesting that the plaintiff be ordered to compensate for losses of over 800 taels of silver. Each side insisted on its own version of events. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo of the First Special Court summoned both parties for a hearing. After lawyer Lin Yingqing for the plaintiff explained the case, he stated that the plaintiff did not intend to keep the damages claimed for himself and was willing to donate the entire amount to Chinese flood relief. Judge Li praised the merchant's goodwill and advised both parties to reconcile. The defendant also complied with the judge's intention to settle the matter amicably and was willing to pay some compensation for the losses. As a result, the defendant compensated the plaintiff for 100 taels of silver in losses, which would be sent to the flood relief agency and donated in the plaintiff's name, with the receipt given to the plaintiff. Both parties had no objections to this settlement method and signed the settlement in court. Using the funds obtained from the lawsuit to generously assist in disaster relief is truly unprecedented. The charity of the Norwegian merchant is especially commendable.</p>

<p>Significant Losses</p>
<p>Shipping Cargo to Xinghua The Kean steamer, which sails between Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Xinghua, is owned by the Ministry of the Navy and leased to shipping merchants to transport cargo between Shanghai and Fujian. This time, after arriving in Shanghai from Fujian, it stopped on the Huangpu River at the opposite side of the Ning Shao Steamer Company pier to load cargo, preparing to leave port today. While loading, a fire suddenly broke out in one of the cabins around 2:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Carelessness in the Main Cabin Around 2:30 AM yesterday, the main cabin of the steamer had already loaded some of the flour, daylily, and fungus destined for Xinghua, etc., and the loading was not yet complete. Suddenly, a fire broke out in the main cabin. At the start of the fire, thick smoke billowed out from the cabin. The shipowner received the news and immediately ordered all the sailors on board to use pumps and hoses to spray water, but it was ineffective. The fire flared upwards.</p>
<p>Fireboats Assist in Fighting the Fire After the cargo in the cabin was burned by the fire, the crew and sailors were unable to extinguish it. They then notified the fire brigade for assistance. The Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched a fireboat to the scene to assist in the firefighting. They vigorously sprayed water in the main cabin. By 7:30 AM, the fire had subsided somewhat, but smoke was still rising, so the firefighters remained on the ship to continue spraying water.</p>
<p>Clearing Damaged Cargo Besides the cargo in the main cabin that was destroyed by the fire, the cargo that was not affected by the fire was also soaked by water. The losses to passengers and cargo on board were already very significant. The steamer cannot leave port today and must clear the burned and water-soaked cargo. The families have already been notified. The ship's hull was not damaged, but the main cabin was damaged. Everything must be unloaded before a further inspection can be carried out.</p>

<p>Panic Withdrawals Subside Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Shareholder Rumors Refuted</p>
<p>Recently, there were rumors fabricated by Japanese individuals regarding the China Industrial Bank, which led to a panic withdrawal of banknotes. Yesterday, after the bank entrusted various money shops to redeem banknotes on its behalf and the money shop guild published a notice to confirm this, the panic subsided. There were also rumors that it had Japanese shareholders and that due to anti-Japanese sentiments, the Japanese planned to withdraw their capital, leading to the turmoil. Yesterday, Lin Kanghou of the Bank Guild said that the bank is purely a Chinese merchant organization, and foreigners are not allowed to hold shares. Moreover, Article 7 of the bank's charter states that the government provides official shares, and commercial shares are raised by the commercial founders. This further proves that the rumors of Japanese shares are unfounded.</p>

<p>Denies Representing Chairman Jiang to Japan His Trip Was Solely for Personal Matters Japanese newspapers in the city had previously reported that Mr. Qi Shiying's trip to Japan was to represent Commander-in-Chief Jiang in discussions with the Japanese government and public. The day before, Mayor Zhang had solemnly declared this to be untrue. Mr. Qi himself arrived in Shanghai by ship from Japan yesterday morning and returned to Nanjing that evening. The reporter made a special visit to his hotel yesterday to inquire about the accuracy of the news reported in the Japanese newspapers. Mr. Qi flatly denied it, saying that this trip to Japan was solely for personal matters and that he did not visit any Japanese political leaders or prominent figures. Furthermore, he departed from Nanjing on September 17th, when Commander-in-Chief Jiang was still in Nanchang, which further proves that the claim of him being a representative is completely a malicious fabrication by the Japanese, intended to confuse and mislead people. Their intentions are truly despicable, he said.</p>

<p>Date for Beijing-Ping Reopening for Passengers Undecided</p>
<p>According to the Kuo Wen News Agency, it was reported that the China National Aviation Corporation's Beijing-Ping service would begin carrying passengers on the 16th of this month. Yesterday, the company stated that the date for the Beijing-Ping resumption was the 23rd of last month. The company had originally planned to consider carrying passengers one month after the resumption. This is currently under consideration, and the date for carrying passengers has not yet been decided. In addition, the company's Vice Chairman, Mr. Pan Lu, received a telegram from the world-renowned aviator Lindbergh from Wuhan yesterday morning, stating that the day before (the 3rd), he had flown to Dongting Lake for an inspection. Just as the plane took off, one wing suddenly broke, so the three people on board (namely Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh and the doctor accompanying them from the National Government's Ministry of Health) fell into the water with the plane. Fortunately, the USS Hermes sent a lifeboat to rescue them, and all three were safe. Lindbergh's plane has now been recovered from the water and placed on the USS Hermes, and he will be arriving in Shanghai on the ship last night. He requested that the company's airstrip prepare aircraft parts and materials for repair after he arrives in Shanghai. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Pan of the company replied to Lindbergh yesterday afternoon, saying that the company has a large stock of aircraft, and it will do its best to assist in the repair. It looks forward to welcoming them to Shanghai soon.</p>

<p>Our country's only channel for foreign communication is the Ministry of Transportation's International Radio Station. Since its establishment in the winter of last year, the station has adopted the latest system for internal arrangements, and the management is also quite effective. As a result, business is booming. It is said that the initial monthly revenue was only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, but it has recently increased to about 200,000 yuan. This shows the trend of regaining control of our rights. During the recent invasion of the three eastern provinces by the brutal Japanese, all foreign propaganda and official telegrams were sent and received by this station, without relying on foreign companies. As for various official telegrams to Geneva, they were all sent by the Sino-French Radio Station of this station and relayed by Paris. On the day after the incident, all Japanese atrocities were spread throughout the city of Geneva. This shows the agility of the station's staff.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau found that the collection period for this year's upper and lower busy season silver tax, since the opening of collection, expired at the end of September. The audited collection amount was quite low. Now, due to the urgent urging from the provincial authorities to remit the funds, it issued an order to the tax collectors yesterday, instructing them to notify the heads of various townships and towns to expedite the collection of the busy season silver tax for this period to complete the process.</p>

After a brief interrogation by the detective chief, one identified himself as Ma Zhenfang, from Guangdong, 22 years old, and the other as Yang Zhicai, from Xuzhou, 19 years old. The detective chief ordered them to be temporarily detained and sent to court for further questioning.</p>

They rescued four children: A'kang, a seven-year-old from Ningbo; Xu Baohe, a ten-year-old; Wang Xinlin, a nine-year-old, both from Nanjing; and Shi Xiaoxizi, a fourteen-year-old from Zhenjiang.  These individuals, along with the suspect Zhao Duanshi (from Anhui), were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper.  A'kang, the child from Ningbo, has already been claimed by his father, Zhao A'fa.  The remaining three children, including Xu Baohe, have been temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care, pending family recognition. The case has now concluded and is awaiting sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xieffen from the Third Criminal Court sentenced Wang Huanan, Chen Xianren, and Chen Zhangshi to four years of imprisonment each, and Wang Lichun and Yang Wanchun to one year of imprisonment each. Before the final judgment, the number of days detained will be deducted at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. Zhao Duanshi was found not guilty and immediately released after Attorney Zhang of the police station declared that he would not appeal.</p>

<p>No Relation to Zhonghe Bank of Chongqing</p>
<p>E Chen She states: The Shenzhuang of the Chongqing Zhonghe Bank, formerly located at No. 79 Zhonghe Lane, Sima Road, was a Shanghai branch of the Chongqing bank that was closed down last year under the orders of the head office. This spring, the Shanghai Zhonghe Commercial Savings Bank was established at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Pentang Lane, and has been in business for half a year. Recently, some people have mistakenly believed that this bank is related to the Chongqing Zhonghe Bank. In fact, this bank was organized by Shanghai's financial community and has no connection with the former Chongqing Zhonghe Bank.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade of the Zhabei Xingjiaqiao Defense Corps has repeatedly received orders from the corps headquarters to expand its membership. However, there are still very few applicants. The original members have been earnestly trained by the brigade commander Xing Minyi and his officers. At a time when foreign aggression is increasing daily and the national situation is tense, it is imperative to rise up at the first sound of the rooster and promote military preparedness. The brigade intends to accommodate as many members as possible. Those who are willing to receive military training should quickly come to the brigade and apply in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Genuine Products to Resist Japanese Coal</p>
<p>The Zhongyuan Coal Company is deeply concerned that Japanese coal is flooding the Shanghai market, accounting for eighty or ninety percent of the coal supply and causing a large outflow of wealth. Therefore, it has developed coal in the Baituchun mining area of Boshan, Shandong Province, and established a branch office in Qingdao to transport coal to Shanghai, supplying the needs of factories and households in Shanghai and other provinces. The Baituchun coal is of excellent quality and has very little ash content. It is not only superior to Japanese coal, but also far surpasses the coal from Kailuan and other mines. As a result, major factories are competing to purchase it, and the sales volume is quite large. Currently, Japanese soldiers are using violence to invade our Eastern Provinces, and the calls to resist Japanese coal continue to rise. Due to the obstructed transportation on the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, the source of Kailuan coal is scarce and the price is soaring. In order to help resist Japanese goods and sympathize with users, the Zhongyuan Coal Company is maintaining the same coal price and is not increasing it. The office, formerly located on Jixiang Street, is no longer suitable for operations. Starting from the first of this month, it has moved to a new building at No. 40 Rongyang Lane, Pingwang Street, Fuzhou Road, and is actively working to expand its business and prepare for a thorough resistance to Japanese coal.</p>

<p>With the national crisis at hand and foreign aggression pressing, the people of the country have risen up to organize volunteer armies to fight to the death against the tyrannical Japanese. Their ambition is admirable. However, at the beginning of preparations, money is needed everywhere as a prerequisite issue, which is fundraising. This kind of huge number can never be achieved by the power of one or two people. It is necessary to seek help from the group. Last time, the Shanghai Boy Scouts raised donations along the way for the flood disaster for a period of three days, and the results were considerable. For this kind of patriotic act, I believe that the citizens of Shanghai will be more enthusiastic than for the flood disaster. Now I will contribute my humble opinion to your magazine. This amount will be designated as the Volunteer Army Fund, specifically for the purchase of military equipment, clothing, and other combat supplies, and must not be used for other purposes. Publicity: Publish a notice in various daily newspapers to announce to the citizens of Shanghai that, regardless of the amount, large or small, according to their ability, there is no time limit. Even a copper coin can be donated. Set up widely available bamboo tubes, like postal mailboxes, with extremely short and concise slogans and serial numbers. They should be sealed on the outside and placed at crowded intersections, large companies, firms, large hotels, restaurants, and other public places. Afterwards, every three days, the person in charge should collect them once. Invite representatives from all walks of life to the venue to open and inspect them together, and publish the total amount in the newspaper to show credibility.</p>
<p>(Reply) Will be published immediately.</p>

<p>Since the tyrannical Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, the loss of life and property in our country is truly incalculable. All patriotic citizens cannot but resent it. The number of people joining the National Salvation Volunteer Army initiated in this city has been even more enthusiastic in recent days. I am determined to enlist as well, but I have not yet informed my parents. If I keep it a secret without telling them, there will inevitably be obstruction later. If I send a letter to humbly seek their opinion (because they are in Ningbo), I am afraid that my wishes will not be fulfilled, and my current position may be affected. Because I work in a shop that resembles a prison, I cannot go out except for important matters. I implore you to reply to how to deal with the above two points. (Reply) Since joining the Volunteer Army has various difficulties and you are afraid of affecting your career, you might as well think of other ways to resist Japan besides joining the army. There are many ways. You can review the methods discussed in the communications published in this column in recent days, or it may be helpful for reference.</p>

<p>Last night (October 10th) at 7 o'clock, when more than 600 students from our school were holding the founding meeting of the Youth Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in the evening school of the YMCA, several Japanese people suddenly mixed in and sat among them, looking around suspiciously. After being questioned by the students, they were ordered to leave, because their speech was incoherent and they could be identified as Japanese at a glance. As for the others who were wearing Chinese clothes, when asked, they were speechless. At this time when the national crisis is imminent, the people of the country are loudly calling for self-salvation and national salvation. When we hold meetings and discussions, the Japanese are insidious and cunning, probing our strengths and weaknesses everywhere, and using a group of lackeys and national traitors to serve them. When our proposals are decided, they are already prepared. Therefore, in future meeting venues, we should pay more attention to inspection to prepare for any eventuality. I dare to ask that this matter be published in your newspaper so that our compatriots can pay attention.</p>
<p>(Reply) Very good. It will be published to alert all parties. Correction: In the reply to Monk Dianchan in the September 25th issue, "Chaozhou Reinvigoration Association of Esoteric Buddhism" was mistakenly printed as "Lake." Also, "Wei" in "Jiang Zaqiao's work" was mistakenly printed as "Zuo." All should be corrected.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Implementation Measures for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement in Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>1. Objective: Based on the educational principles of the Three Principles of the People, and with Japan as the target, train children so that they have a deep understanding and memory of the historical humiliations inflicted on our country by Japanese imperialism. One method focuses on physical training and sincere inspiration, in order to cultivate healthy, patriotic youth to seek revenge and save the nation.</p>
<p>2. Methods: Abandon all empty talk and general discussions, adopt the principle of active implementation, and divide into three aspects: teaching, training, and administration. (1) Teaching: All teaching spirit should focus on the Anti-Japanese National Salvation issue, and the atrocities and aggressive policies of Japan against us in the past should be incorporated into the teaching materials of each subject as much as possible, taking the recent dispatch of troops to the Northeast as a starting point and proceeding in conjunction with each subject at the same time. For example, using the "Project-Based Learning Method," "Anti-Japanese National Salvation" can be used as the central unit for each subject's teaching design. In addition to teaching materials, collect and compile children's reading materials related to Japanese research and the history of national humiliation as much as possible, so that they can be inspired at all times to resolve to resist Japan and save the nation, without forgetting it over time. The physical education and hygiene subjects should pay more attention to methods of physical fitness and intensify training so that everyone has a healthy physique. (2) Training: With teachers as leaders, all teachers and students should take advantage of opportunities at any time and place, such as memorial weeks and morning meetings, to intensify training or encourage each other to implement the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, and to ensure that their thoughts and actions are effectively put on the right track, such as adopting national goods, saving money to save the country, developing habits of hard work and endurance, and promoting healthy and strong physical exercises, etc. Anti-Japanese National Salvation maxims can also be formulated as armbands to be observed forever. On the one hand, arrange the environment with paintings, wall newspapers, slogans, etc., so that there are startling and alarming alerts everywhere. In addition, various competitions and propaganda that can stimulate their patriotic enthusiasm without hindering their studies should also be held from time to time. Outside of class, teachers should take advantage of the opportunity to guide them in various national salvation activities, such as adapting the recent Japanese atrocities into children's songs and scripts for them to perform, etc., in order to deepen their memory. (3) Administration: All faculty and staff should form an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Research Association to discuss all issues related to Anti-Japanese National Salvation, and to stipulate concrete implementation methods and the progress steps of teaching and training. At the same time, it is necessary to plan and promote the implementation of the cause so that it extends from the school to the nearby community, and should also enlighten students' families with the concept of Anti-Japanese National Salvation at any time, and conduct national salvation actions together. After the implementation of the school's Anti-Japanese National Salvation methods, the results obtained should be compiled into a report and submitted to the competent authority separately, and as a basis for pre-planning the second step of methods.</p>
<p>3. Precautions: When implementing the above methods, the following provisions should be strictly observed: (1) All actions should comply with the regulations of the Central Government and should be considered from a positive perspective. (2) Abandon empty talk and reckless action, and strive to be practical and effective. (3) Teachers should lead by example and be leaders of the children. (4) Teaching and guidance should be adapted to the needs of children's physical and mental health at all times, with the overall goal of achieving practical results quickly. (5) The attitude of principals, teachers, etc. should be extremely loyal and sincere so that children will always believe in them. (6) Focus on enabling automatic action, and avoid passive or compulsory behavior.</p>
<p>4. Supplementary Provisions: When these measures are implemented, each school may make changes according to the environmental conditions, but it should not violate the principles of the first objective. Local.</p>

<p>President Zheng Hongnian Serves as Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>National Jinan University is renowned for its students' robust physique and outstanding athletic performance, and it has always placed great emphasis on military training. In light of the recent incident in the Eastern Provinces, students are outraged by Japan's tyrannical behavior and have been unusually active in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement. The student army has been expanded and reorganized into an all-student volunteer army, with intensified training. The university affairs meeting has resolved that President Zheng will serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Student Volunteer Army, and the Commander-in-Chief has appointed military instructors Zhou Jiashou and Wang Xueyuan as Deputy Commanders, responsible for training. Peng Qinghe is the Chief of the General Corps, Cai Rongrui is the Commander of the First Battalion, Zhou Zhaoqin is the Commander of the Second Battalion, Huang Yulang is the Commander of the Third Battalion, Huang Weinan is the Commander of the Medical Team, Huang Yuru is the Commander of the Nursing Team, and Ye Yusheng is the Deputy Commander of the Nursing Team.

<p>The Grandeur of Wang Jiyuan's European Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>The renowned painter Mr. Wang Jiyuan is holding an exhibition of his European works at the Mingfu Library of the Chinese Science Society at 533 Albert Road from October 1st to 10th. It has been open for several days, and crowds of viewers have been flocking to it every day, especially young students from various specialized schools. Being able to strive for academic research amidst the Anti-Japanese cries is truly the foundation of national salvation. According to Mr. Wang, during his travels in Europe, he witnessed the Japanese Art Association's international propaganda, which revealed its long-held ambition to dominate East Asia, causing Westerners to only know about Japan when talking about modern Eastern culture, without knowing about China. This is truly infuriating. He hopes that the domestic art world will unite and fight the tyrannical Japanese together, engaging in forceful propaganda internationally to wash away this shame. Students who have studied Western painting in Japan and have now returned to the country out of anger should continue their research in domestic art groups. Art is an endless pursuit for life, and it is the most important point in the survival of any nation. Mr. Wang's unwavering holding of the European painting exhibition in Shanghai, which is related to the views of various countries, during this national crisis shows the undying spirit of the new Chinese nation. As we try to read Mr. Wang's works, such as "Victory Gentleman," the atmosphere of innovation is filled in each painting. Whether it is oil painting or watercolor painting, they all have unique oriental style. There are two newly published collections on the venue, and the printing is also exquisite. It is said that there are still seven days of the exhibition.</p>

<p>Shanghai Hong Kong Inter-Port Tennis opened yesterday morning at the French Chamber of Commerce. As a result of the competition, the Shanghai men's team won all two groups, and the Hong Kong women's team won all two groups, so the situation is very stable. The competition continues today from 10:00 a.m. and closes tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Hong Kong Women Are Awesome <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Won all two sets of singles and doubles</p>
<p>Chinese women go and see</p>
<p>A total of five groups are competed in the women's group, three singles and two doubles. Winning three groups first wins the championship. Yesterday morning in one doubles and afternoon in one singles, the Hong Kong team won all the games and got two points first. If you win another group today, you will win the championship. The ferocity and wilfulness of the Hong Kong women's team is unparalleled for a time. Shanghai ladies and ladies may not be able to follow their example. Chinese women can go and visit. 　　Opening game Hong Kong female general Wei Shi</p>
<p>Mrs. Kailan Manipulates the Whole Game</p>
<p>Mrs. Kailan 6 to 2 Mrs. Temu</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Mrs. James 6 to 2 Mrs. Biling</p>
<p>The women's group took the lead and kicked off the battle. The first to appear were the Hong Kong doubles team Mrs. Kailan and Mrs. James against Shanghai's Mrs. Manttemu and Mrs. Biling. The two Hong Kong ladies won all two games, 6 to 2, and 6 to 2, and opened the victory. Shanghai's Ms. Manbi was completely defeated by the wind. In the first set, the Shanghai team only got the fourth and seventh innings. In the second set, the Shanghai team won two consecutive games with Mrs. Kailan's several non-balls. For a moment, the Hong Kong team scored six consecutive games and won again 6 to 2. Mrs. Kailan of the Hong Kong team is the leader of the whole game, with long strokes from the baseline, accurate and powerful both forehand and backhand. And it is especially good to command her partner Mrs. Moose to advance and retreat, so the cooperation is very 俴. Ms. Biling of the Shanghai team occasionally has a Jurist performance, but unfortunately Ms. Man is slightly lacking in grasp, and her body is heavy, so walking is greatly ineffective, good awesome Mrs. Tuofu wins again.</p>
<p>The Runner-Up of the Whole Shanghai Is Not Her Opponent</p>
<p>6 to 4</p>
<p>Mrs. Tothan (Hong Kong) Miss Firth (Shanghai)</p>
<p>6 to 2</p>
<p>Mrs. Tuobianhan is also one of Hong Kong's outstanding players. In the afternoon singles, without effort, she defeated Miss Fiers of Shanghai in a row, 6 to 4, and 6 to 2. Thus, the Hong Kong women's team occupied an extremely advantageous position with a score of 2 to 0. It was reported earlier that Mrs. Tuo was unable to play due to feeling unwell, but yesterday she played without any signs of illness. Although Miss Fei is the runner-up in the whole Shanghai, she only failed to Li Xinghua. Miss Xinghua has gone this year and has sat on the championship and fought with Mrs. Tuofu, but she is completely not her opponent. The long strokes that penetrate the baseline fly to both corners, and they are accurate and unparalleled, and they are heavy and powerful. Both forehand and backhand are as desired. Miss Fei once took the lead with 4 to 3 in the first set, and did her best to smash it. Mrs. Tuofu could handle it with ease, so Miss Fei was defeated.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Shanghai Men's Team Strived for Success <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Won two sets of singles and doubles as well</p>
<p>Winning one more group wins the championship</p>
<p>The Shanghai men's team reversed the decline and sluggishness of the women's team. One singles and one doubles, all won against Hong Kong. Winning another group tomorrow will win the championship. Yesterday, almost all of them were Chinese, four in doubles, all of whom were Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Three General Tong Yi Qiu Feihai Defeated the Enemy <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Battle Was Loose First and Then Tight</p>
<p>6 丨 1</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (Shanghai) 6 丨 4 Fin Que (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>6 丨 4</p>
<p>The singles match between Qiu Feihai and Fen Que was the first cause of the opening of the great battle between Shanghai and Hong Kong men. When the referee Lin Baohua lifted the battle curtain, Fen Que shot the ball, and Qiu's responded with a skillful hitting method, and it hit immediately. From then on, Qiu's was successful, sweeping straight and hitting, as if entering an uninhibited place. Fen Que succumbed to the situation, was dominated by others, had more than enough heart and not enough strength, and lost four games in a row, lifeless. In the fifth game, Lai Gong's strength actually saved a game, so as not to be completely destroyed. Qiu won the first set with 6 to 1. 　　From the second set, Qiu's was not as enterprising as in the previous set. Some said that Qiu's was merciful, and some said that Fen Que gradually showed his magic. In fact, both of them had it. Qiu's won two games first, and Fen Que also won back two games. Then three or three were tied. At the time, Qiu's resisted hard because the opponent's momentum was strong, and finally won the second set with 6 to 4.</p>
<p>In the third set, Qiu obviously lost his control, and the ball was high and low with very little grasp. Although he won in the end, he spent a lot of effort. Fen Que often had wonderful performances, but his will was still not calm, his body was fat and his actions were slow, and the final failure was due to this. This set was one of the most compact scenes for both sides. Victory in the first game belonged to Qiu's. Looking back, Fen Que chased forward with 2 to 1. In a flash, Qiu's also led with 3 to 2. After several rounds, Fen Que led again with 4 to 3. At this time, Fen Que lacked strength, and Qiu's won the third set with 6 to 4, and the great success was completed.</p>

<p>Qiu Jiang Won Three Games Straight</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai 6 to 0 He Jiaxin</p>
<p>(Shanghai) 6 to 2 (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang 6 to 2 Yu Wenjie</p>
<p>Yesterday's finale was that Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang won the Hong Kong He Jiaxin Yu Wenjie with three straight sets with a score of 6 to 0, 6 to 2, and 6 to 2 in doubles. The Shanghai team won with a score of 2 to 0. He Yu's were extremely depressed yesterday. They only got four games in the three sets, and they often saw that they had already scored three points, but they ended up failing.</p>
<p>He Jiaxin's performance yesterday can be said to be satisfactory, and the secondary style is the most beautiful, with light and agile steps, but unfortunately Yu Wenjie's combination is slightly worse. There are many balls that Yu himself hopes to touch the net. The two found that there were collisions with each other, which was due to the fact that the cooperation was not good. He gave a big show of blocking the net and suffocating in the third game of the second set, and he was praised a lot for a time.</p>

<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear countrymen. Have you seen what a certain Zhongbing said in yesterday's newspaper? He said. "Now all parties have become greatly aware. Make great unity. The past is like yesterday's "death". The future is like today's "birth". From now on, we will work together with one heart to resist foreign disasters." How wonderful these words are. How happy we ordinary people are to hear them. I hope that from now on, they will truly think about the people's "life" and the national economy, and find a "life" path for the entire Republic of China. It can also make the citizens of the Republic of China "live" as Chinese and "die" as Chinese ghosts. Don't make them "live" as slaves of a fallen country and "die" as ghosts of a fallen country. As citizens, they should all cheer up and supervise them. It is absolutely forbidden to "die" again after "today's birth".</p>

<p>My friend Zhu Ying took a letter he wrote to congratulate DY on his suicide to me a few days ago. In the letter are words, tears, and blood. How can I tell them apart? I hope that people who want to commit suicide in the world will read this letter before they die, and people who don't want to commit suicide will also read this letter before they live. Zhu Ying's letter is: "Received the letter and knew that you wanted to commit suicide! This is a great act of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and I specially congratulate you. In this kind of empty and contradictory society; "He teaches people to eat without planting rice, wear clothes without planting cotton, and live in houses without building forests. He teaches people to envy luxury and look down on farming. He teaches people to divide profits without creating profits. He teaches farmers' sons to become bookworms. He teaches the rich to become poor, and the poor to become extra poor, the strong to become weak, and the weak to become even weaker." He even makes it so that those who don't plant rice eat good food, and those who plant rice don't have food to eat! Those who don't plant cotton wear good clothes, and those who plant cotton don't have clothes to wear! Those who don't build forests live in good houses, and those who build forests don't have houses to live in! People in this kind of empty and contradictory society are so distressed! Under these circumstances, most young people with weak will often become its victims! You are a preparer to be sacrificed under this empty and contradictory society; I am a survivor of this empty and contradictory society who has not yet been sacrificed. When I was between the 6th and 7th years of the Republic of China 丨丨before I met you丨丨 I used the strength of my entire family, old and young, to cultivate thirty acres of land, and I also encountered a good year, with a rich harvest, but the grain price was manipulated by the gentry, and I was forced to sell cheaply, losing all my money. I often thought of committing suicide, and often ran to the Hexi Bridge or Guhong Bridge, twenty miles away from home, to commit suicide at night.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Zeng Guofan's Boycott of Japanese Goods and Promotion of Domestic Products <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yutian</p>
<p>Since September 19th, the violent Japanese occupied our Eastern Provinces and massacred our people. The people of the country were unanimously indignant. Therefore, the anti-Japanese propaganda was expanded, and Japanese goods were boycotted as a whole. Economic severance with Japan. The boycott of Japanese goods, the promotion of domestic goods first, is known to everyone. For example, in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, which are indispensable to our daily life, food and housing do not require Japanese goods. However, for clothing, we use Japanese goods the most. Therefore, I will present what I have seen in this conversation. The upper class's clothes The upper class is not limited by money, and wears silk and billie ni rong. (According to the authentic billie ni rong, it is a Western product.) However, the lining used is still inseparable from Japanese goods, such as rayon, sub-silk, and beautiful but not durable banling and so on. They are everywhere.</p>
<p>The middle and lower classes' clothes People in the middle and lower classes often use rushed billies, rushed tribute, etc. due to money relations, because silk, billie ni rong, etc. are expensive, and there are few beautiful domestic fabrics. (According to the rushed goods, they are all Japanese goods.) All middle and lower class people buy them because they are cheap and have an appearance. How much money is spilled out every year?</p>
<p>The history of domestic native cloth Domestic native cloth has a history of thousands of years. In this era of commercial warfare, it is not eliminated. It can maintain its inherent position. (Try to watch tenant farmers still wearing native cloth) Of course, there are considerable benefits. Its quality is strong. It is far better than Western goods, which are real billies, let alone Eastern goods. Its value is dozens of times cheaper than Western goods. For thousands of years, cold and heat have been used as clothes, so why not still use local cloth to make clothes now? Individuals save money and spill less money. Why not do it?</p>
<p>Zeng Guofan Promotes the Top-Down Effect of Local Cloth In the late Qing Dynasty, Zeng Guofan (Zeng was from Linzhang, Hunan) held military power at the time and governed the army strictly. All his clothes were Linzhang native cloth. (Linzhang is a cloth producing area) If the officials and subordinates wore</p>
<h3 id="e150">Two Questions <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>When I read the news of the League of Nations meeting, I couldn't help but ask two questions.</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government announced that it has no territorial purpose in Manchuria. May I ask the Japanese government, does it have a ruling purpose in Manchuria? If it does not have it, then why participate in the Jilin Provincial Government (including civil administration and military administration)?</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese government continues to withdraw its troops to the railway area as soon as possible. May I ask what the limit of the word "as soon as possible" is. For thousands of years, it may not be interpreted as not as soon as possible. May I ask how to define the four words "railway area"? The Jichang Railway, Jidun Railway, and Jihai Railway in Jilin Province have never been visited by Japanese troops. Is the so-called railway area referring to the South Manchurian Railway and the Anfeng Railway?</p>
<p>Chinese silk clothes, he would be scolded and even dismissed. As a result, soldiers and subordinates in the army changed to Linzhang native cloth. When the army went, local officials and gentry who came to visit the camp had to wear Linzhang cloth clothes. Linzhang cloth became famous and its sales increased sharply. (Middle-aged people in the cloth industry who are 40 years old know the prosperity of Linzhang cloth sales) Is this not the merit of the top-down effect?</p>
<p>Government officials should first promote domestic cloth to show boycott and frugality This year, the people of the whole country have suffered a great catastrophe of floods. Our people have no survivors. Opening up new sources of income and reducing expenditures should be mentioned in the same breath. Clothes are necessities of life, but luxury and frugality are very different. Therefore, I hope that government officials will first promote native cloth. From the chairman to the subordinates, all of them will change to native cloth. (Native cloth robes and short clothes are both possible) Then the people of the whole country will naturally follow the top-down effect. (Our people are very imitative) The sales of native cloth will increase greatly in less than three months. Foreign goods are invisibly stagnant. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Blood-Tearful Words Amidst National Crisis <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The Wokou (Japanese) have resorted to arms, violently occupying our land and cruelly slaughtering our compatriots. All who possess blood and qi (vital energy) should urgently raise their voices and jointly face the national crisis. It must be known that the eastern neighbor harbors insidious schemes and has long regarded our country as unguarded. Recently, I gathered with friends, and our conversations were filled with blood and tears. National subjugation is imminent. Do we know what the suffering and misery will be like after national subjugation? I take up my pen to describe it, and tears flow unrestrained.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhang studied in Japan several years ago. After arriving in Tokyo, he sought a moderate inn near the local provincial association, intending to move there. The innkeeper inquired about his name, nationality, and age. Immediately, he revealed a look of contempt and said, "The upper floors of our inn are for Japanese, the middle floors are for Koreans, and you, as a Chinese, can only live on the lower floors." Mr. Zhang, upon hearing these words, felt grief and indignation fill his chest and he stormed out, flinging his sleeves. From this, one can see that the Japanese regard us as even inferior to Koreans. What is bearable if this is not? The famous actor Gao Fu'an, once renowned both north and south, was celebrated wherever he went. Gao specialized in martial roles and was skilled in combat. One year, he traveled on the South Manchurian Railway from Dalian to Fengtian. The South Manchurian Railway was within the sphere of influence of the tyrannical Japanese, and unequal treatment often occurred between Chinese and Japanese. At that time, a Chinese woman with a young child was in the same carriage as Gao. The child, being ignorant, accidentally defecated due to diarrhea. This was seen by the Japanese in the adjacent seats, who all began to scold her noisily. The woman quickly got up to clean it, but the Japanese anger did not subside. They claimed that it harmed public hygiene and demanded that she be punished by licking up all the fecal matter. Gao, hearing this, felt indignation and stood up to argue with composure. Three or four Japanese, overpowered by reason, attempted to attack him. Gao knocked them all down. Knowing that he would be humiliated by the police upon arrival at the station, he escaped mid-journey by jumping out of the window. Afterward, the Fengtian consulate negotiated with our country's authorities. Gao was eventually arrested and imprisoned for several years. This incident was narrated by Mr. Liu and is also recorded in a certain factual novel. Even before our country is subjugated, the unreasonableness of the Japanese is already like this. From the small, one can see the large. It is needless to say that the three northeastern provinces have been ravaged and devastated this time. As fellow citizens of China, how can we constantly embrace a policy of non-resistance and allow their iron heel to spread?</p>
<h3 id="e152">Sustained, Widespread, and Inexpensive Anti-Japanese Patriotic Propaganda <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>In the anti-Japanese patriotic movement, propaganda is also an essential task. Therefore, anti-Japanese patriotic slogans have recently been posted on streets and in alleys, either made of paper or written on cloth. However, they are damaged by sun and rain within a few days and require frequent replacement, which is laborious and costly, and cannot be widely disseminated. Now, there is a method that is inexpensive and can be sustained and widely disseminated. I wish to contribute it to enthusiastic patriotic compatriots: 1. All national newspapers should permanently publish anti-Japanese patriotic slogans in prominent positions. 2. School textbooks should include a lesson on national humiliation.</p>
<p>3. All bookstores should permanently print a brief record of the Japanese atrocities on the cover, inside the cover, or on the inside or outside of the bottom page of books, magazines, and illustrated books. Currently, many books and magazines use ready-made zinc plate drawings to fill the blank spaces. In the future, national humiliation drawings should be used instead. 4. All bank notes, checks, and pawnshop checks should permanently print the words "Do not use this to buy Japanese goods" or similar phrases. 5. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently printed on the account books, invoices, receipts, and wrapping paper of all stores. 6. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently printed on calendars, monthly calendars, theater curtains, advertising films in cinemas, and explanatory brochures. 7. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently printed on all kinds of decorative boxes and cans, such as canned foods, cigarettes, cosmetics, paper-wrapped tin cans, and various trademarks, such as yarn brands.</p>
<p>8. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently printed on all kinds of supplies, such as enamelware, thermos bottles, and various kinds of porcelain. 9. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently added to pens, ink, and all other stationery, and children's toys, wherever words can be added. 10. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently painted on the large glass windows and large lampshades of stores. 11. The words "Do not forget Japan" or similar phrases should be permanently added to all kinds of cakes and pastries where words can be added. 12. Anti-Japanese patriotic slogans should be permanently printed on the stationery and envelopes used daily by people from all walks of life. Those items listed above that can be implemented immediately should be implemented immediately. Those that cannot be implemented immediately should be prepared for implementation, so that the people are shocked and alert at all times. This relies on the promotion of the guilds of various industries. As for slogans, they must be made by intelligent people. However, anti-Japanese patriotism cannot be achieved solely through empty words and propaganda. We still need to cultivate real strength. What is real strength? Actively, it is (1) strengthening the body, (2) studying various kinds of knowledge, and (3) revitalizing industries. Passively, it is (1) not wasting energy on useless things, and (2) not spending money on useless things, so that we can save this energy and money for the purpose of serving the country.</p>
<h3 id="e153">China's Gandhi <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Lesu</p>
<p>A decade or so ago, Diamond and Lion brand tooth powder were widely popular in China. Since the emergence of Invincible brand tooth powder, Diamond and Lion brand tooth powder have been defeated, though invisibly. Now, Invincible brand tooth powder is popular throughout the country. Isn't this benefit taken back from the Japanese? Then, Tian Xuwo Sheng, the inventor of Invincible brand tooth powder, can be considered a Chinese Gandhi. Su Jiayuan's satin blue cloth and indigo cloth were most popular among the common people in the Qing Dynasty because they were economical and durable. However, fashionable people mostly did not use them. As for the officials and scholars, only those in mourning used this cloth to make robes and jackets. As for the ladies and young ladies, there was absolutely no one who used this cloth to make clothes. It is said that the old lady of Zhu Yifan used to like to use Su Jiayuan's satin blue to make shoes. The Xinhai Revolution changed the dress code. Su Jiayuan cloth became patriotic cloth. At that time, who in the country, from the court to the common people, was not wearing patriotic cloth? Things like woolen serge were rarely seen. This benefit was not given to foreigners. Then, can't Su Jiayuan, who improved patriotic cloth, also be considered a Chinese Gandhi? As for Feng Yuxiang, who bared his body and practiced boxing in the snow in December, Tao Xingzhi who wrote and mimeographed pamphlets to promote commoner education, and Nie Yuntai, the author of the "manure doctrine" who often ate plain rice without side dishes, and Zhu Xianfang, the great master of Chinese textiles who spent sixteen or seventeen copper coins a day, all can be counted as Chinese Gandhi. There are many Chinese Gandhi! Where is there no Gandhi?</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Teapot, Lu. Is it for sale? How are things? Just a pot of wine! Do you know that our people have many hardships? We have wine, but we cannot drink it. What can we do? The brutal Japanese come to invade us. Life is as short as a moment. Don't you see the Wokou (Japanese) setting nets in the Northeast? They kill innocent people by the thousands. Shocking telegrams arrive, but we just wail. Now, the situation has no outcome. We cannot go on, brother! The enemy is full, but our people are hungry. Our homes are occupied. We have mouths, but we cannot speak. Such old people, young people, women, and children, cry out for food, but no one helps. No one wants to return. Returning is no different from being separated by mountains and rivers. Once you get here, how can you escape the whirlpool? We cannot go on, brother!</p>
<p>Take it easy, who is not like me? The cry to overthrow sounds like a strong man. When things come to a head, there are only empty words. The authorities have good plans, but they are ultimately just paper tigers. The soldiers are not enough to protect the borders. Foreign enemies come to abuse the innocent. We are weak citizens, and we are slaves of another country. We must know that we must be united against Japan. Empty-handed, we regret our wasted time. What is the point of shouting "overthrow"? Just take it easy.</p>
<p>Officials, cherish your treasure! Wake up early! Everyone knows it now. The Japanese ambition is not small. How many troops are they sending? What is the point of economic sanctions? Being outwardly strong but inwardly weak is laughable. Continuing to be helpless and non-resistant, the eastern neighbor claps his hands, and the western neighbor is annoyed. No wonder diplomatic concessions are ridiculed. No one likes us among nations. We must decide quickly! Loudly warn the officials: cherish your treasure and wake up early!</p>

<h3 id="e155">The Pestle of Knocking Dreams (4) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Layman should know the difference between flowing with and against the current. This old monk has a clear explanation. Turning the chair in the direction of the Earth's rotation is called flowing with the current. It's just that the speed of the revolving chair is thousands of times faster than the Earth's rotation. Therefore, the world that the people on Earth have not yet encountered is already known to the person sitting on the revolving chair. Layman does not want to see that future golden world, but only wants to make that China of one or two hundred years ago appear before your eyes. This is also very easy. This old monk uses a method of flowing against the current, turning the revolving chair in the opposite direction of the Earth's rotation, which is called flowing against the current. It's just that the speed of the revolving chair is thousands of times faster than the Earth's rotation. For example, when walking, the person on Earth takes one step, but the person on the revolving chair has already retreated thousands of steps. Therefore, the world that has become history is not visible to the people on Earth. The person on the revolving chair only needs to keep reversing, and even the Han and Tang dynasties can be chased back, and one can personally witness their glory. How much more so is it to reverse the time of China one or two hundred years ago? This is how it is explained. "May I ask the old monk, how is it explained when time does not flow?"</p>
<p>"Layman, flowing with the current is the future view; flowing against the current is the past view... not flowing... is the present view."</p>
<p>"How is it called the present view?"</p>
<p>"This is also the wonderful use of the revolving chair. It does not make it flow with the current, nor does it make it flow against the current. Sitting on this chair, no matter how long you sit, it is still the present. Looking back at the people in the world, the young grow old, and the old die; only the person sitting on the revolving chair does not change in youth, does not change in complexion, and is always in the present state. This is called the non-flowing of time."</p>

<p>The settlement price of US currency was implemented yesterday, rising sharply by about five taels. The specie price rose slightly yesterday, and the situation was moderate. Although there were twists and turns, it only fluctuated by three or four taels around 730 taels. The settlement price of US currency has now been implemented, and the market situation has been suppressed by half. As a result, it rose by about five taels again. The intention of the industry seems firm, but there are not many trading volumes on the table. The price of silver initially fell and then rose, but it then saw a setback due to active selling. Afterwards, buyers began to move, and as the US dollar quotation contracted, the market situation gradually rose, once breaking through 35 taels. It then flattened out at noon. The market will be closed due to the weekend, but it should be remembered that this week has been quite sharp, rising from within 680 taels to beyond 740 taels, with a high and low of nearly 70 taels. The overall increase of 43 or 44 taels can be called enormous. Moreover, combined trading for November and December is actually easy, which is a historical first.</p>
<p>The silver price quotation contracted and immediately rose. The opening price yesterday morning rose by 4.3 mace, totaling 732 taels. The large lot was not changed, and the silver price contracted by one-eighth. The same was true for private telegrams, and the buying was active. It was calculated that Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, Wupin, and others came in, followed by 34 taels. Suddenly, Shunli, Yifengyong, Bingxing, and others sold off, immediately cutting down five or six taels, only totaling 28 taels. Afterwards, the receipts and disbursements of each firm were complex, but the trend seemed to be upward. US dollars were traded mutually by banks at 31.125 yuan for the near term, then 1.1875. Therefore, the gold price rose by four or five taels. When British gold opened, it was 33 or 34 taels. The listed British exchange rates were as before, and the US dollar had fallen by half a yuan, then suppressed to 33 taels and 34 cents. Subsequently, Yuan Maoyong, Qian Changxiang, Tong Taichang, and hedgers all came in, adding more than two taels. In just three or four minutes, it rose to 36 taels. However, Zhifengyong, Shunli, Yifengyong, and others sold, and at 10 o'clock it was 32.5 taels. It immediately rose to 34.8 mace, and Yuan Xingyong and others bought in, and Maigali ate up the December US dollars at 31.1875 yuan. Afterwards, Tong Taichang, Hengyu, Yu Fayong, and others sold in succession, and the foreign exchange trend also loosened. It was calculated that British gold was difficult to sell at 1.6875, and then it was traded at 9375, so the price fell by 5 taels zero. At 10:30, it was 29.5 taels. After that, it floated uncertainly, around 31 taels until 11:30. In the light of the scene, buyers were quick, and they immediately raised it to 34 taels, but there was no large amount. It was then suppressed to 32 taels. Unexpectedly, Zhifengyong, Hengyu, and others came in, and at noon it was 32.8 mace. By the time of closing, it was 32.5 mace. Continued trading, the price was flat, only a few cents up and down, for 2.7 or 8 mace, an increase of 4.8 mace compared to the day before.</p>
<p>The revealed price to press 90 taels, according to the maximum of 36 and minimum of 28 taels in half a day, there is an 8 tael difference. Wupin's early market was 29 taels, and the noon closing was 32.5 taels. The revealed price is now changed to US dollars, calculated according to the listed price of 28.875 yuan, approximately 830 taels. It is calculated that there are more than 90 taels to press. The logged make-up water is 33 taels, and the current red strip is calculated to add 12 taels.</p>
<p>The buying and selling in the industry varied, and the trading on the table was diverse. Statistics show that Yuan Xingyong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuan Kangxiang, and those who hedged US dollars all came in. Qian Changxiang, Yuan Tai, Tong Taichang, Cuichangyong, Yuan Maoyong, and others had many receipts and disbursements. Zhifengyong initially came out and then came in. Bingxing, Dakang, Futaiheng, Yu Fayong, and Shunli all came out. Yifengyong, Daxingyong, Yuan Mao, and others came out and then came in. Wupin's hedging was mostly bought in. Guangbang had little trading. Dalianbang came out with more than 900 strips and came in with 200 or 300 strips.</p>

As a result, it suddenly increased by 5 or 6 li compared to the day before, with 265,000 jiao traded in the early market and 125,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins contracted by 1,500 wen, totaling 374,000 wen.</p>

<p>The underlying code for the interest rate for this September was increased due to tighter silver reserves, making it the only increase this year. It was recently resolved at the Qianye Standing Committee to be 5.5 taels with a 95% discount. Overdue interest will be added accordingly. As such, the highest overdue interest is calculated to be 11 taels and 5 mace, an increase of more than 1 tael compared to normal times, it is said. Securities</p>

<p>Falling by 1 to 2 yuan, securities prices, after the previous sharp drop, were temporarily serious. With the efforts of all parties to maintain them, they have been greatly eased in recent days, and the price has also hovered and risen. However, there is no major turnaround in the market's sentiment. Those with goods gradually sell them. Apart from empty accounts profiting and making up for losses, there are still considerable transactions, but large accounts rarely take in investment transactions, and they wait and see without major movements. Although peace with Guangdong is expected to be achieved, the floods this year have exhausted the people's resources, and the Japanese are invading the Northeast, taking steps forward. As such, people are still uneasy, and each bond started to drop sharply when it opened in the early morning due to oversupply, with the second plate price falling by more than one yuan several corners to more than two yuan compared to the day before, while the minimum for unified tax fell by almost three yuan. The market fluctuated in the later market, with mutual increases and decreases compared to the morning. As a result, the overall sixth fell the most by two and a half yuan, and the remaining ones fell slightly by one yuan to two yuan or so. Only 96 contracted by only one corner and a half. Observing its situation, it is difficult to hope for improvement, it is said. It is calculated that the entire day's spot trading only involved 3,000 yuan for salt tax and demobilization, and futures were calculated to be 5.9 million in the morning market and more than 2.4 million in the later market, totaling 8.37 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market turned tired, and the falling trend rose slightly. The recent situation is particularly difficult to grasp. Due to special relationships, it can stretch and shrink, with no certainty. As for the world trend, it is naturally seen as tired, but the domestic anti-Japanese patriotic movement is becoming increasingly fervent. Inferior yarn cannot pass through, and the lack of goods is naturally difficult to be small. Once news is encountered, the change will be faster. Therefore, stable people remain calm and wait and see. The Foreigner Label fell by one or two taels. The opening market of the Foreigner Label was slightly flat, with each month falling by 2, 3, and 7 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual sales were not smooth, and it fell again by 3, 7, and 9 cents, to 1 tael and 1 mace. The total number of transactions for the entire day was 37,700 packages. Checks showed that Xiesheng sold 1,000 packages, Deji sold 1,000 packages, Ruidata sold 1,550 packages, Shenji sold 1,650 packages, Rongxing sold 950 packages, and Mingde sold 900 packages.

<p>The falling trend of American cotton is becoming increasingly intense, with a downhill trend. October has already seen five and a half points, and the calculated silver plate only amounts to 25 taels. Measuring its condition, it is still difficult to be stable. However, the local market situation has not been greatly affected. Because ordinary cotton merchants and Han gangs have a tight squeeze rumor at a time when the source of October is not踴, the situation is relatively firm. Distant months are brought up by its belt, but the world trend is extremely dangerous. Therefore, speculators are still throwing out a large number of distant months, and the future may have a period of drastic change. If foreign cotton does not turn around, the standard cotton may see a particularly low price, it is said.</p>
<p>Speculators throwing out distant months, Han standard. The opening market of Han standard in the front market was weaker, with each falling 2 mace and 2 or 3 plates. It then recovered and increased. As a result, the current month increased by 1 mace and a half, and the distant fell by 5 fen to 1 mace and a half. Each month fell by 5 fen to 1 mace and a half in the afternoon. Statistics of the number of transactions: 72,800 dan. Checks showed that Meiji sold 3,000 dan, Jifeng sold 1,000 dan, Dafu sold 2,000 dan, Gengfeng sold 2,200 dan, Hengyi sold 1,600 dan, and Yiyu sold 1,300 dan.

<h3 id="e167">Sharp Decline in American Cotton Last Week <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from New York on the 2nd reports on the cotton market for the week: The New York cotton market continued its downward trend last week due to southern hedging. However, the price decline was slightly checked by short covering and buying by peers. Currently, the market price has fallen below 6 cents, further arousing people's attention. Local sentiment is quite uncertain. Given the current situation, the increase in collections makes further declines very likely. The weather is also suitable for harvesting, but progress is quite slow. The fields are almost entirely white. If there is wind and rain, the quality may be affected. The next government report is likely to maintain or slightly increase the forecast, but this is uncertain. The Department of Agriculture's response to the European Cotton Exchange's questions stated that the Washington government currently opposes subsidizing the export of American cotton, which will cause foreign buyers to reconsider.</p>

<p>Grains: River Below Rice Market Arrives Booming Sales are Weak. Many Nantou rice shipments arrived yesterday, for sale in city and rural stores. Due to the daily decline in foreign rice prices, sentiment is weak, and sales remain sluggish. Therefore, thick and thin broken japonica rice is slightly fatigued. Not many new japonica rice shipments have arrived. The sales market is quite active. New foreign Dujian rice arrivals and sales are normal. The market is also stable. Arrivals of water chestnut tips are rare. Due to the continuous sharp price declines, selecting high-quality items is slightly active, so the market is stable.</p>
<p>The New Gate yesterday market received the 32nd and 33rd shipments along the Suzhou River, mostly from Wuxi and Qingjiao gangs. The local shops are not very active. There are still abundant stocks of new japonica rice. Sentiment is flat. Thick japonica and broken rice prices are down one or two jiao. There are not many stocks of new foreign Lujian rice, and the price is slightly close to one jiao. 240 shi of Baige rice arrived yesterday. The rice quality is good. The price is slightly two jiao lower than before. Although not many Bianyin yuan rice shipments have arrived, sales are sluggish, and prices are also declining. Early rice shipments from the wharf are slightly active, and the situation is decreasing by about one jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Foreign Rice Futures Fall Another 1.5 Mace <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Spot Foreign Rice Falls Around 0.4 Jiao. Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions were very sluggish due to foreign merchants repeatedly devaluing and selling. Local customers lacked large-scale sales, and the market was full of inventory. Sales were cut off, resulting in this sluggish situation. After the market price declined slightly, there were some transactions. 1,000 bags of spot Min Dang were sold for 11 yuan 2 jiao, about 4 jiao lower than the previous day. This was handled by the Shantou gang. Futures opened slightly lower. 300 tons of March returned rice were priced at 5 taels 4 mace initially, then fell to 5 taels 3 mace 5 fen, another 1.5 mace lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Flour Market Plummets <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Selling Pressure... Prices for all Months Fall 3-4 Fen. Yesterday, the flour market again showed a sharp and drastic decline. The current financial situation has entered a severe period. Except for Tianjin, all sales in the north have been hit by Japanese atrocities. In addition to the continuous disaster relief in the Yangtze River North and South disaster areas, a large amount of American flour will also be shipped soon. Given the abundant stocks accumulated by Shanghai factories, the long position has been shaken step by step. Now, with the arrival of American flour and the stagnation of sales in the north, coupled with the daily tightening of finance, most of the high-priced buyers have reached a forced liquidation. Therefore, those with strength can still support, otherwise they will urgently close out positions. The price drop in the market is an inevitable path. The lowest price for this month was 1 tael 9 mace 2 fen 2.5 li. November was 1 tael 9 mace 4 fen, both lower than the opening price of the day and the lowest record for this year. As a result, this month fell 4 fen from the previous day, November fell 3 fen 2.5 li, December fell 3.5 fen, January fell 3 fen 2.5 li, and February/March fell 3 fen 7 li.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Wheat Futures Plunge Over 1 Mace <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market unanimously plunged again. The low opening price was not only a new record for this year, but also the lowest seen in the last three to five years. The sentiment of those holding short positions is endless. The real reason is that there are too many selling chips. The factories are also full and cannot accommodate them. Therefore, inland customers, when faced with internal and external pressure, have no way to maintain their positions. Moreover, due to huge losses, those without strength can no longer support themselves. Therefore, they are unanimously and gradually selling. Long-term futures are falling even more sharply due to the Russian wheat situation. Looking at the future, if there is no way to sell it, the factories will also reject it and remain inactive. This kind of drastic drop is likely to continue. As a result, this month plunged 1 mace 1 fen from the previous day, November fell 1 mace, December fell 1 mace 2 fen, January fell 1 mace 3 fen, February fell 1 mace 1 fen, and March fell 1 mace 2 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Gradually Opens 10,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market received telegrams from the production areas: There were no arrivals of Cuban raw sugar or New York sugar futures. Java spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. The association's offering of Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse white saw little trading. Ordinary goods were priced at 11 taels 4 mace. Slightly higher was 11 taels 5 to 6 mace. No. 20 medium white was at 10 taels 9 mace 2.5 fen, with a firm trend. Mianhe white was at 11 taels 9 mace. Bowl Qing was at 8 taels 3 mace. There was a lack of shipping. The market situation was very good. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was offered at 12 taels 3 mace, with few inquiries. HM Mark was at 11 taels 6 mace 7.5 fen, with a relatively stable market. The company gradually opened 10,000 bags of goods for sale, which were scheduled to be shipped after the full moon this month. The price was 2.5 fen higher than the previous offering. Bidding was quite active and has already been sold. Later offerings are showing signs of gradually increasing. The Dutch sugar being offered included 200 tons of old coarse white sand to be shipped in October and November, sold by the Fu Jia Foreign Firm at a price of Dutch currency 5 yuan 5.5 jiao. The market sentiment was still stable. A certain firm quoted 6 yuan for new coarse-grained sugar, but there were no buyers at that time. The Hua Xin Zhen Xiang No. 2 was offering Dutch red sugar Nos. 8 and 9 at a price of 9 taels 3 mace to 2.5 mace, reportedly selling over a thousand bags.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Zhen Mei Green Tea European Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>Since the foreign firms in this port have recklessly invaded our country, the tea market has been in a state of decline. Although there have been some sporadic transactions in Lu Zhuang, Mai Xi, Zhen Mei, Xiu Mei, and other items, the market price has generally trended downward. The most sluggish item is Zhen Mei. In the last ten days, only the Jin Jiang Foreign Firm has purchased 600 boxes of Tunxi Zhen Mei. The quietness of the market can be seen in general. Fortunately, there is not much stock in the market and the source is scarce. The attitude of Chinese merchants remains firm as before.</p>
<p>Hardware: Tinplate Suddenly Shows a New Situation</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the tinplate market is showing signs of a new situation. For example, the Tianjin gang suddenly saw purchasing, with transactions reaching a large amount of 400-500 boxes. Hankou and Sichuan have also sent telegrams to pick up shipments, with transactions also reaching more than 600 boxes. Local factories are also widely decorating, so the market is booming and the trend is suddenly active, no longer like the previous dull and immobile scene. Although the market has not seen an increase in price for the time being, it feels much firmer than before. 90-pound English goods are sold for 13 taels 5 mace, 100-pound for 15 taels 2 mace 5 fen. 90-pound American goods are sold for 15 taels 5 mace, 100-pound for 16 taels 7 mace 5 fen, and 200-pound for 29 taels 5 mace.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Japan's Overseas Aggression and Overseas Chinese <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>By Shen Meizhen</p>
<p>At this moment, the brave soldiers in the Northeast are throwing their heads and spilling their blood, fighting heroically and indignantly against the artillery fire from the Japanese devils, who harbor sinister intentions. The book "Japan's Overseas Aggression and Overseas Chinese," compiled by my old friend Liu Shimu, has also been published. Reading this kind of book, which exposes the enemy's secret aggression, would already be heartbreaking in peacetime. Reading it now, when the nation is in peril, is even more infuriating. The Japanese are invading everywhere, flaunting their relatively strong national power, recklessly barging in, and not hesitating to become the world's criminal. It is hateful to think about it. However, hating them is also futile. Japanese artillery fire has already erupted uncontrollably in the Northeast, proving that their northern expansion policy has reached the boiling point. In this book, there is an explanation of their means of aggression: "Japan's means of aggression in the East are divided into two routes. One route is to use countless soldiers in northern China to expand their gradual and encroaching colonial policy, known as the Northern Expansion Faction. The other route is to use countless sailors in southern China to expand their all-encompassing colonial policy, known as the Southern Expansion Faction."</p>
<p>At this time, when their northern expansion is extremely active, it seems gratifying to expose the situation of their southern expansion.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism's southern invasion has been carefully planned for more than just a day. It is only because the time is not yet ripe that it has not yet developed into the tragedy that the Northeast has suffered this time. We only see batches of advance invaders being sent to Southeast Asia. The amount of their investment in Southeast Asia is increasing year by year. At the same time, books advocating southern invasion and various practical activities related to preparing for southern invasion are also shifting from calm to complex. Therefore, those who are pessimistic about the world are paying close attention, fearing that Southeast Asia will be the fuse for a world war. This kind of worry, when compared to the beastly behavior that the Japanese are unleashing in the Northeast this time, is not unfounded. In this book, we can also find statements that are sufficient to cause this serious situation, such as "Southeast Asia, the world's richest resource, is naturally connected to Japan. With seasonal winds, a single sail can cross south, the sea waves do not rise, and the other shore of Southeast Asia can be reached. Southeast Asia is the former hometown of the Yamato people and today's new stage." From these few words, we can see what Southeast Asia is like in their minds.</p>
<p>We need to know why Japanese imperialism is moving toward Southeast Asia in this</p>
