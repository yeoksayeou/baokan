<p>照着各方面的情况看起來共匪蔓延的地方雖然似乎很廣但是就實力說起來究屬無多而且他們雖然號稱第幾軍第幾師掛上了一塊共産的招牌實際上殺人放火姦淫擔掠無所不爲完全是比從前的强盜土匪更加利害是不過爲萬惡的强盜土匪而己民衆方面雖然在其狂暴之下一時忍苦含痛的隨從附和但是國軍所至一經宣傳勸導誰不願去暗投明重復來過他安居樂業的生活所以我們相信進剿命令一下共匪雖極狡詐實不難一鼓撲滅不過共匪盤踞之地民衆中毒較深受禍最烈將來於軍事勝利得到之後還要希望黨政方面的同志大家努力從根本上求得一個整理善後的辦法然後才能澈底澄清出匪區民衆於水火而登諸袵席</p>
<p>關於此次剿匪我們應該有幾件特别注意的事情（一）宜絶對保護軍機用兵最貴知己知彼所以我們應盡力剌探匪方情形而我們自己的情形却萬不能讓人知遭凡是我軍的軍事計劃以及部隊的調動部隊的位置均有絶對秘密的性質必須嚴防洩漏或者漫不經心拿到新聞紙上去發表我們的同志要明白洩漏軍機的危險要以保護軍機爲自己最重要的責任（二）宜注重根本肅清共匪而不在求形勢上的速效我們此次剿匪必須認定共産黨是國民革命的最大障碍亦即中國民衆最大的公故我們要以精密的計劃準備根本肅清我們不以一月半月即在能克復何地爲滿足我們必須辦到誅除匪首收繳槍械安撫民衆然後才算是達到我們的任務（三）宜實際報告匪情我們對於共匪旣然抱了根本肅清的决心有了根本肅清的計劃一旦進剿命令下達必然一步一步的計日呈功（四）切實保護民衆軍隊剿匪志在求民所以宜嚴守紀律愛護民衆絶對不宜擾害民衆（五）予被壓迫民衆以自新有一般民衆係被共匪壓迫入夥應當脅從罔治予以自新之路共黨自首者尤所歡迎」（二月二十五日）</p>

<h3 id="c112">六公司江輪聨盟漲價 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲滬漢運費漲三成</p>
<p>▲本月十六起實行</p>
<p>▲南北洋五一加價</p>
<p>金價狂漲各輪局爲開支浩大船内所用五金暗耗尤巨故凡江海各路水脚在三月分起均議漲價己經增費者在揚子江内有長沙線重慶線各加百分之二十及三十分不等在沿海方面又有滬台線滬甬線各增百分之二十至於最關重要之長江一路因太古·日清·怡和·招商三北·寗紹·等六公司創議營業同盟故將漲水脚一案亦併入同盟案内討論現己得有結果亟將此事詳情查紀如下</p>
<p>▲增漲水脚六公司對長江上下水貨之運費在二次討論營業合作案會議時即將增漲水脚費一事提出先行磋商會議結果僉以金價日昻開支日大而船員水手等工薪又兩度加增爲維持營業計須照其他航路一律將水脚價照原額增十分之三議定實行期爲三月十六日起對於去冬所增一成半之淺水費現猶保留即使廢止亦當在十五日以後議定後各公司代表一致同意即日將運費表重行修訂一面通知各客家查照</p>
<p>▲决定聨盟六公司長江營業聨盟己於第二次開大會議决期間定爲暫訂一年中六家營業互相公開（一）運率統一（二）不得私自濫放暗盤（三）取締客家偷减斤量（四）實收實報（五）如有對聨盟有主張歧異者可由實行合作後在第十個月起儘此九十天内提出意見交會付諸公議以决定第二期之聨續與否</p>
<p>▲討論辦法關於聨盟實施之公攤辦法尚須由六公司再加討論因各家之船舶有多寡生意有大小而在營業上各有特殊之優點與缺點更有特約訂立之運輸契約等非若滬甬線之簡單也招商局在長江班若大通·若安慶·若武穴等埠其營業獨占優勢而爲外輪所不能侵佔者一旦聨盟對於此處未免吃虧故亦由該局提出應予保留未便攔入公攤項下故六家之公攤辦法須經長時間的磋商細則擬定至速須爾個月之久刻下聨盟原則業經决定除公攤細則外則先行實施矣</p>

<h3 id="e23">Success of British-Italian-French Negotiations <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>After the news of the British Foreign Secretary's arrival in France and the French government's expression of agreement spread, the governments of all countries were overjoyed, believing that the great success of the Five-Power Agreement would bring about world peace, which is indeed very optimistic news. Although today's telegrams still reveal two points of concern: one is that the content of the agreement has not yet been announced, and there may be internal disputes within Italy and France over whether the agreement is detrimental and unfavorable; the other is whether Japan and the United States will express full agreement with the agreement. However, judging from the general trend, the governments of all countries are eager for the speedy achievement of peace, and the people of all countries are trembling with fear of the recurrence of war. At this time, there will certainly be no more quibbling, so it seems that these two concerns are not likely to be problems.</p>
<p>However, we still have further hopes that after military cooperation among countries, it can be followed by economic cooperation. The success of the arms reduction agreement can eliminate future military wars, and the success of economic cooperation can eliminate future economic wars. Economic issues are more complex than military issues, and their impact on the governments and people of various countries is more important and urgent. Therefore, it is certainly not easy to seek sincere cooperation among nations. However, if there is no adequate understanding on economic matters, it is difficult to guarantee that the dangerous situation of this turbulent trend will not lead to a military situation triggered by economic competition. Therefore, we have this further hope.</p>

<p>The British Delegation Returns Home Victorious</p>
<p>Submarine Tonnage in France's Favor, Japan Reveals Desire to Invoke Precedent, Content of New Italian Agreement to Be Announced Soon, London Naval Treaty to Be Slightly Revised</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st -- British Foreign Secretary Henderson and Naval Minister Alexander arrived here today from Rome and immediately went to the French Foreign Ministry to report to French Foreign Minister Briand on the negotiations on naval issues with the Italian authorities in Rome. After British, French and other foreign ministers met at the Foreign Ministry for three hours, good news came out, saying that the negotiations were successful and that the terms of the agreement negotiated by the cabinet members of Britain, France and Italy would be submitted by the cabinet members of the three countries to their respective governments for approval. With the above-mentioned diplomatic efforts over a week, the British Foreign Secretary actually turned the three-nation naval treaty into a five-nation convention. Another telegram said that the communiqué on the naval incident has now been released, stating that British Foreign Secretary Henderson and Alexander have notified the French Foreign Minister and Naval Minister of the results of the Rome meeting. Henderson and Briand then jointly telegraphed Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, saying that they were pleased to report that they had fully agreed on a solution to the disarmament issues left unresolved at the London Conference in Rome. They would ask their respective governments and the governments of other countries concerned to approve this plan. At the request of British cabinet members, the content of the plan will not be announced for the time being, as the governments of the United States and Japan, as well as the governments of the British overseas autonomous territories that attended the London Naval Conference a year ago, must first be notified. It will be announced simultaneously in Rome, Paris, London, Tokyo and Washington within the week or on Thursday. The French Naval Minister told reporters tonight that the current plan is to make minor, non-essential revisions to the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>National 2nd, Paris -- Today, the British delegation departed for London after a great success. French Foreign Minister Briand and Navy Minister Doumer personally went to the station to see them off, reiterating the French government's gratitude to the representatives for helping France and Italy resolve naval issues. As for the comments of the French newspapers, because the new naval agreement agreed upon last night has not yet revealed its content, all agree that its advantages and disadvantages must be judged after the full text is announced. However, they all solemnly stated that the good atmosphere created this time should eliminate the current misunderstandings between France and Italy as soon as possible. Therefore, the newspapers deeply feel that the future is promising, and there is still a force to promote the next international disarmament conference. In addition, considering the Italian national budget, the future naval military preparations can be reduced to a minimum, which will also be of great benefit to finance.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd -- According to the Paris Echo, the new naval agreement stipulates that the French Navy has 630,000 tons, which is 150,000 tons more than Italy. The newspaper also said that the number of 10,000-ton cruisers for France and Italy is equal. France can place 70,000 tons of submarines.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd -- Informed circles believe that the new Italian naval agreement can be accepted by the United States. The changes discussed by the public are so minor in nature compared to the London Agreement that they have no significant impact on the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd -- The news that the naval negotiations in Paris and Rome have been successfully concluded is welcomed by Japanese officials. The content of the agreement is not yet known. The public expects that France will get more submarine tonnage than Britain, Japan and the United States, but this tonnage is only a temporary measure pending the results of the next year's disarmament conference. Japan may not protest against France's advantage in submarines, but those who study naval policy believe that a part of the Japanese will therefore make a strong call, because Japan's high submarine tonnage requirements at the London Conference were rejected.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd -- This afternoon, Japanese newspapers published news that seemed to be authorized, saying that the result of the French-Italian negotiations was that France would have 80,000 tons of submarines, Italy 50,000 tons, the status quo of 8-inch gun cruisers would remain unchanged, light cruisers and destroyers would be 136,000 tons for France and 120,000 tons for Italy, and France would build two warships of 23,000 tons each to counter Germany's "pocket-sized" battleships, while Italy would build two smaller tonnage ones. The general public is now afraid that Britain may increase submarine tonnage to counter France, in which case Japan will invoke Article 21 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty and increase tonnage accordingly.</p>
<p>National, Rome, 1st -- Italian newspapers have published long articles on the new British-Italian naval agreement. The content of the agreement has not been officially announced, so all discussions are vague and do not touch on the essentials. However, they all unanimously express their welcome, saying that they firmly believe that the Italian Prime Minister's move is aimed at national security and European peace. The newspapers also clearly stated that the British-Italian compromise is not a separate treaty between the two countries, but a basis for France and Italy to sign the London Naval Treaty in the future. Therefore, the newspapers deeply feel that the future is promising, and there is still a force to promote the next international disarmament conference. In addition, considering the Italian national budget, the future naval military preparations can be reduced to a minimum, which will also be of great benefit to finance.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bombay, 1st—Today in India, an optimistic atmosphere prevails due to another meeting between Viceroy Irwin and Gandhi, which lasted quite a while. After the meeting, Gandhi stated that the talks were not finished and further discussions were needed.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 1st—General anxieties regarding the negotiations between Irwin and Gandhi are gradually turning into optimism. The All-India Congress Working Committee convened today to study the Viceroy's revised response. It is reported that the Viceroy's answer regarding the investigation of excessive police actions during the disturbances is now more moderate than before.

<p>▲ Depriving Students of the Right to Vote</p>
<p>▲ Government Takes Opposing Stance</p>
<p>Hamaguchi to Attend Parliament on the 9th</p>
<p>▲ Japan Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd—During today's general budget session in the House of Peers, Watanabe and Foreign Minister Shidehara, acting on behalf of the Prime Minister, engaged in the following Q&amp;A: Watanabe asked, "When I visited and inspected various places in Manchuria, I heard Japanese residents say that Shidehara's diplomacy toward China is extremely passive and very unfavorable to the development of Japanese in Manchuria. What are your thoughts on this, Foreign Minister?" Shidehara replied, "Japanese activities in Manchuria should focus on areas other than labor, namely capital or intellectual endeavors, to compete with the Chinese. Only Koreans can compete with them in terms of labor. The issue of commercial lease rights has been outstanding for over a decade and has yet to be resolved, which is regrettable. We plan to proceed with resolving this issue in the near future after gaining China's understanding. The biggest obstacles to the harmonization of Sino-Japanese relations are the Japanese residents' disregard for the Chinese and the government's excessive reliance on the South Manchuria Railway. The government has not made concessions in diplomacy."</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd—The government held an extraordinary cabinet meeting today to discuss the attitude it should take towards the House of Peers' amendment to the election law. As a result, it expressed agreement on two points: (1) changing the election age to 23 and (2) not granting voting rights to active-duty military personnel. It expressed opposition to (1) depriving students of the right to vote. Regarding the request from the Privy Council to add provisions related to the Public Security Preservation Law to the disqualification clauses, the government holds that the current law already stipulates that those who violate the Public Security Preservation Law and are sentenced to six years or more in prison are deprived of their voting rights in accordance with Article 6, Item 5 of the current law. Therefore, further amendments cannot be agreed upon. This will be communicated to the Privy Council to urge reconsideration. If the Privy Council does not approve granting voting rights to students aged 25 or older and does not include the Public Security Preservation Law in the disqualification clauses, the government has decided to withdraw the entire amendment and take a tough stance.</p>

<p>Authorities Have Not Officially Considered It</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 1st—The Associated Press learned today that unless the Chinese National Government expresses its attitude on the major silver loan matter, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will not take any formal action. It is generally believed that while the silver mine owners have enough power to pass the Pittman Silver Act II (i.e., the silver loan matter) in the Senate, any action by the US side would be hampered if the National Government does not express its willingness to accept the loan. Furthermore, Lin Bai-k, an advisor to the National Government stationed here for a long time, has been striving to create public opinion in favor of the silver loan, but his negotiations have been difficult to succeed because the Senate has not acted on the Pittman Silver Act II, and the authorities have not yet given formal consideration to Lin's plan. According to Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it is unlikely that Pittman's silver loan proposal will proceed until the 72nd Congress, which will be newly elected, convenes. Even then, it cannot proceed unless the National Government expresses its attitude.</p>

<p>Japan Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd—Major astronomical observatories around the world have recently made precise observations of the expansion of stars. According to the results, celestial bodies are gradually moving away from their centers (i.e., the sun), and the scope of the universe is gradually expanding. This is still judged based on spectroscopic photography. This phenomenon shatters the traditional theory of cosmic decay and proves that the universe is still on the path of evolution. The interest of astronomers around the world is currently focused on this point. Public cable.</p>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng: Respectfully to the Jishui Relief Society, Red Cross Society, Academic Society, and the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee: The disaster of war in Henan has spread throughout the province, and western Henan, including Luoyang, has been cut off for a long time. Even with money, it is difficult to buy food, and the number of deaths is countless. We have repeatedly appealed via telegrams for relief and rescue. Recently, the situation has become even more urgent. Those who have come to Bian (Kaifeng) along the Longhai Railway to seek food are gathered in large numbers, with thousands arriving every day. The elderly are being helped by the young as they walk along or cling to the trains. The five porridge kitchens opened in Kaifeng are already unable to accommodate everyone, and the original funding is about to be exhausted. It is difficult to welcome them or refuse them. If they are left to wander, not only will there be more deaths from cold, epidemics, and disease, but there is also the fear that they will gather and cause chaos, affecting public security. We have long admired your societies' benevolence and compassion for those who are hungry and drowning. We earnestly request that you quickly allocate a large sum of money and provide relief grain to save these surviving people and extend the lifeline of the country. We are deeply grateful for your great benevolence, not only the people of Henan, but also ourselves. Urgent words and waiting for clear instructions. Zhang Fang, Henan Relief Committee, bowing.</p>

<h3 id="e46">First General Meeting of the National Commerce and Transportation Conference <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The first general meeting of the National Commerce and Transportation Conference was held at 9:00 AM on March 2nd in the auditorium of the Ministry of Railways. 131 members were in attendance. First, Chairman Lian Sheng-hai introduced Director Liu Weichi of the Business Department, who reported on the plan to reorganize railway operations. (A) Regarding increasing revenue: (1) restoring transportation capacity, (2) centralizing and controlling vehicles, (3) implementing joint transportation, (4) cracking down on transshipment companies, (5) increasing warehouse facilities, (6) implementing responsible transportation, (7) inviting merchants to handle cargo insurance, (8) organizing ancillary businesses, (9) abolishing additional levies on each railway, (10) appropriately increasing freight rates to improve operations, and (11) prohibiting the sale of freight cars. (B) Regarding reducing expenses: (1) strictly adhering to the budget and comprehensively reviewing expenditures, (2) improving railway materials, (3) utilizing anti-corrosion sleepers to reduce expenses, (4) increasing locomotive efficiency, (5) striving to save on coal consumption, (6) increasing work efficiency, and (7) utilizing statistical methods to reduce operating costs. Next, plans for developing the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, reorganizing the Pinghan Railway, completing the Yuehan Railway, the Capital Ferry Plan, comparisons of the highest revenue years of each railway over the past two years with current operating funds and revenue, the number of kilometers of each railway line, the number of employees, comparisons of wages, comparisons of equipment and public works maintenance costs for the last three years, the actual amount paid for foreign debt by each railway in the 19th year and the comparison with the gold price in the 18th year, the comparison of foreign debt owed by each railway at the end of the 18th year calculated at the current gold price and calculated at the gold price at the end of the 18th year, the comparison of assets and liabilities of each railway, the gold exchange rate index for the last three years, the cargo price index related to railways for the last three years, and the price increase index for the last three years have all been prepared in detail. The above are all the most essential attempts to reorganize railway administration at present, and they are also the elements that this conference should be responsible for studying. It is hoped that all representatives will pay close attention, determine a good direction, and seek future relief, so that there is a basis for proceeding, etc. Then, the chairman reported that the conference had received 85 proposals and several temporary proposals, all of which have been classified and cataloged. Please discuss them one by one in order. After the report, the discussion of each case began according to the agenda. The first was the construction category: (1) The Longhai Railway Bureau proposed that the Longhai Railway extend the route to Xugou and implement the construction of a seaport. The resolution was passed and submitted to the Ministry of Railways for joint handling. At that time, someone proposed that there were a large number of proposals and limited time for the conference. If each proposal was discussed at length during the conference, it would be uneconomical. It was suggested that review committees be established by category to review each case, and then report the results to the conference for discussion. Someone also proposed that any case that could be resolved immediately at the conference should not be submitted for review. If the conference could not resolve it, then it would be submitted to the review committee for discussion. The chairman then announced that in accordance with Article 19 of the rules of procedure, a review committee would be organized and several review committee members would be appointed from among the attending representatives. One of them would be designated by the chairman as the chairman of the review committee. Member Su Minsheng supplemented the opinion that it would be more convenient to establish several groups of review committees according to the type of proposal. There was no dissent, and they were divided into four groups: construction, reorganization, transportation, and freight rates, each with ten or more review committee members. Some members voluntarily participated in a certain group as review committee members. The chairman designated Shi Dao-yi, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Railways, as the chairman of the construction group review committee; Guan Genglin, Counselor of the Ministry of Railways, as the chairman of the reorganization group review committee; expert Chen Guangfu as the chairman of the freight rate group review committee; and Wang Jianzhong, representative of the Hebei Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, as the chairman of the transportation group review committee. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the morning of March 2nd, the Central Party Headquarters held the 101st Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Yu Jingtang, Ma Chaojun, Miao Peicheng, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Li Shizeng, Liu Luyin, Kong Xiangxi, and Ding Weifen, as well as guests from various agencies and staff members of the Party Headquarters, totaling over 400 people, attended. Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting. After paying respects, the chairman reported, in brief, that since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene a National Assembly, the Central Government has been working hard to prepare and has promulgated the Organic Law of the National Assembly. Because of his school commitments, he requested leave to go to Guangdong. During this period, the Central Government announced that he and Comrade Sun Ke would be responsible for the preparatory election headquarters. Because he had no experience, he did not know how to handle it and telegraphed the Central Government to appoint someone else, but the request was not approved. After returning to Nanjing, he had to work hard with Comrade Sun to take on the responsibility. He will take office in the National Government today and can report on the preparations for the National Assembly. As of last Friday, 18 election supervisors had taken office in 16 provinces and two cities. Within a few days, there should be continued reports of telegrams arriving in Nanjing. This shows that all regions are working hard. This meeting was short and preparations in various provinces were inevitably difficult, but the comrades in the local party headquarters worked hard to publicize and the government worked hard to prepare, which will ensure the meeting is held as scheduled. The main duties of the headquarters are to interpret laws and regulations. This has been handled by ten cadres appointed by the Central Government. Some of the cadres participated in drafting the laws and regulations, and some have worked in the Party Headquarters for a long time. There should be no difficulty in interpreting them. Next, the preparatory work for the meeting and reception is handled by the Fourth Group. The venue has been decided to borrow the newly built auditorium of the Central University. At that time, it will be completed as scheduled. The reception is also being planned carefully. The task of the National Assembly is what all comrades should pay special attention to. This issue is very important, and most people across the country still do not understand it, and many comrades in the Party Headquarters are still studying it. The full text of the Organic Law of the National Assembly explains the meaning of the National Assembly, saying that the National Government is following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to convene the National Assembly. This is the source of the meeting. According to this meaning, the task of the meeting is known. Foreign merchants often argue that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's reason for advocating the convening of the National Assembly was entirely to deal with the warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Now that the object has disappeared, it may not be necessary to convene it again. This argument is due to a lack of understanding of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Dr. Sun Yat-sen has specified two things in his speeches and declarations: (1) the unification of the country and (2) the construction of the country. How can unification be obtained and how can construction be done? These are the questions of the National Assembly itself. But before the meeting, there should be a correct concept, and then publicity can be carried out. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that all construction should start with psychological construction and emphasized the swearing-in ceremony. The National Assembly has a short session, and national affairs are numerous and complex. The unification of military affairs, finance, internal affairs, and transportation all require concrete plans. All of these are specialized knowledge and cannot be determined in a short period of time by a collection of representatives who are not specialized scholars. Therefore, in order to seek unification, it is necessary to start with psychological construction first. In the past few years, our party has been working to eliminate reactionary warlords in order to build the Republic of China. But the construction of an official country requires the responsibility of all people in the country. To build, there must first be determination. This determination is the beginning of psychological construction. Therefore, the first task of the National Assembly is to convene national representatives in one hall to accept Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideology, representing national citizens swearing that the national citizens believe in the Three Principles of the People and strive to build. Second, the path to construction has many threads, but the construction plan has been developed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. For example, when we build a house, we must first have a blueprint. The engineer builds according to the blueprint and cannot change the blueprint. The things that have been decided in the blueprint are the blueprint for building the Republic of China, which is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction. This is still a complete blueprint that must be followed. Until the completion of the tutelage, the Party will return the heavy responsibility it bears to the people. Before the people accept it, in other words, during the period of building the Republic of China, it should be carried out in accordance with this outline. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has been working wholeheartedly in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction. However, this kind of construction work requires not only the efforts of the comrades of the Party but also the concerted efforts of all the people of the country in order to succeed. Therefore, the National Assembly has another major task, which is for the representatives attending the meeting to represent the national people in accepting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction. After the meeting, the national people trust the work of the Party and should also fulfill their respective obligations in accordance with the Outline. From the above, it can be seen that the task of the National Assembly is to have the national people clearly accept the Three Principles of the People in law, and to have the national people clearly recognize in law that the construction of the Republic of China should be carried out in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction. On these two points, during the period of national construction, there should be a covenant between the Party and the people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen gave several lectures in Japan on the matter of the provisional constitution. After the Xinhai Revolution, the format of European constitutions was imitated and a provisional constitution was promulgated, but this was not the provisional constitution that Dr. Sun Yat-sen hoped for. The provisional constitution advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the Party responsible for building the country and the people of the country agreeing on how to build the Republic of China and who should be given the power to build the country. Therefore, the meaning of the provisional constitution is roughly the same as the meaning of the three chapters of the provisional constitution in history and is very different from the meaning of the constitution. Before the foundation of the Republic of China is stable, if a provisional constitution that is the same as the constitution is formulated, the people are not prepared to implement the provisional constitution, and the government does not have the conditions to fulfill it, it will inevitably lead to mutual violations of the law. For more than ten years, the meaning of the provisional constitution and the constitution have often been confused. Dr. Sun Yat-sen has explained in detail the tasks that the people should bear in his Outline of National Reconstruction and his will. Therefore, if the National Assembly advocates a provisional constitution, the Party, in order to make the people understand the tasks that the people should bear during the period of national construction, can also advocate the formulation of a provisional constitution, but the meaning of the provisional constitution is only these points: (1) The Chinese Kuomintang, which bears political responsibility, and the people decide in law what methods to use during the period of national construction to fulfill the task of complying with the Outline of National Reconstruction. (2) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy is covered in the Three Principles of the People, the Outline of National Reconstruction, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, etc. There are many threads. How should the key points be extracted and the most important points that the Party and the people should jointly adhere to be simply stipulated so that there is something to follow in the future? Regarding the issue of the provisional constitution, a concerted effort should be made in publicity in the future so as not to confuse the meaning of the provisional constitution with the constitution. The Central Government has not yet made a formal decision on this matter. Today, the Central Standing Committee will have concrete and definite resolutions so that everyone has a basis. The Central Committee members who went to various places to inspect party affairs all have this idea, so I very much hope that the Central Standing Committee will have a concrete and detailed decision on this matter. I deeply feel that this issue is very important, so I will explain it based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. I hope that everyone will seek a common point in their thoughts and wills, and then they can achieve good results, etc. After Dai's report, the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned. On the same morning at 10:00 AM, the National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Peide, Cai Yuanpei, Wang Chonghui, Wang Boqun, Shao Yuanchong, Liu Shangqing, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Cao Haosen, Jiang E, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Huichang, Wang Zhengting, Lin Xiang, Ru Yuli, Zhu Lihe, Chen Yi, and staff members from the civil service and military affairs departments of the National Government, totaling over 300 people, attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting. After paying respects, Chiang reported on the issue of the provisional constitution, and then the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Waning Bandit Forces in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The largest military organizations of the bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are in four locations: the border area of Anhui, Henan, and Hubei; western Hubei and Hunan; the border area of Hunan and Jiangxi; and southern Jiangxi. Please allow me to explain them separately.</p>
<p>The bandit army in the border area of Anhui, Henan, and Hubei consists of the Fourth, Eighth, and newly organized Twentieth Armies of the Red Army, with over 20,000 soldiers and nearly 40,000 Red Guards. Led by Li Can, the pseudo-commander of the Eighth Army, they are based north of Huang'an and Macheng and have established a Soviet government. All bandits who murder and steal, as well as defeated soldiers and vagrants, raise the red flag and unite with them. In each battle, they drive the Red Guards, who are poorly equipped and untrained, to harass our army's front lines, while their main force, the Red Army, hides in a corner, specializing in attacking our army's weaknesses. They have repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with Xia Douyin's Thirteenth Army and Zhang Yinxiang's division, commanded by Ji Hongchang. Their goal is to seize Huangma to remotely support the Jiangxi bandits. Our army has been besieging them for a long time. The reasons for this are fivefold: (1) Accumulated snow blocks the roads, making transportation difficult and inflexible. The bandit army burns all rice and firewood that they cannot carry when they retreat, leaving us with nothing to take. (2) The bandits use the border of Anhui and Henan as a retreat, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, making it difficult for us to pursue them. (3) The reconnaissance of the bandit situation is inaccurate, often mistaking the Red Guards for the Red Army and focusing our efforts on dealing with them, losing sight of the location of the main Red Army, which they then exploit. (4) The people are afraid of the bandits' burning and killing, and they bow their heads and dare not reveal the bandit situation. (5) Each army divides the pacification area, only driving the bandits out of the territory, and cannot cooperate fully to achieve the effect of encirclement and suppression. Now, the headquarters and the border defense offices of Hubei, Anhui, and Henan have formulated a new plan to target the Red Army with the means of "catching the thief, catch the king" and severely attack them. The armies are united, without dividing boundaries, with the goal of eliminating the bandits as the achievement, not just driving them away. On one hand, various cleansing bureaus are established to strengthen the local defense forces, enabling them to guard and allowing the army to eliminate the bandits' strength. The bandit army, having been severely attacked by the Thirteenth Army, has fled from northern Macheng into Henan Province. However, their remnants are still hidden among the bushes and are determined to be cleared within one month starting from March 1.</p>
<p>Western Hubei and Hunan: The bandits in western Hubei and Hunan use Honghu as their nest. After our army destroyed Honghu, the bandits fled to Jianshi and the Hua'an area of Hunan, spreading like wildfire and meeting with He Long's remnants. Therefore, Xu Yuanquan, the border defense commander of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, suggested that in the future, it is not necessary to break the bandit nest first, but to use the plan of encirclement and annihilation. He Long's bandits have a long history in the border of the three provinces. At first, they may not have been communists, but they changed their loyalty so many times that no one dared to comfort them. Having nowhere else to turn, they willingly attached themselves to the Red Army. However, they cannot get along with Zhu De and Mao Zedong. If He Long is pursued relentlessly by the government army, he will inevitably disperse his followers and take a few confidants in disguise to escape. Before long, he will return and regroup his remaining followers. The unemployed and desperate people of Sangzhi are numerous, and joining the bandits is their only means of survival. If forced, they will hide their guns and remain as ignorant people, enough to escape the eyes and ears of government soldiers. This is how He Long can gather and disperse his followers, but his strength is still very weak, with only five or six thousand guns. The organization of the so-called Red Guards is far inferior to other communist bandits. They have now fled north to the Hefeng area and are being cleared by Xu Yuanquan's division, a part of Liu Xiang's Sichuan army, and the Hunan armies of Li Jue, Chen Quzhen, and Zhang Ying. The government has ordered Ye Kaixin, the former commander of the Eighth Army, to be the border defense commander of Hunan and Guizhou to prevent them from fleeing south. However, few people know the whereabouts of He Long himself.</p>
<p>The border area of Hunan and Jiangxi: The border area of Hunan and Jiangxi is bounded by Pingliu in Hunan and Xiutong in Jiangxi. Peng Dehuai, the communist leader who attacked Changsha previously, used this as his base. The communists previously planned not to seize cities but to take the first step of communizing the border towns. The earliest attempt was in the four towns on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, so the four towns have been a bandit den for many years, and the people have a tendency to be communist. After Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue went south to join Zhu De and Mao Zedong, Kong Hechong took over the area and is now entrenched in the Qinglin secluded area under the jurisdiction of Xiushui County with 10,000 guns. Kong's goal is to follow in the footsteps of Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue and attack Changsha, creating a second great terror. However, He Jian did his best to defend the border, and Kong could not succeed, so he changed to defending his position, attempting to contain our military strength. However, our side also detected that Kong's bandits were becoming increasingly poor, so they ordered the original Eighteenth and Fiftieth Divisions of Jiangxi Province and the three divisions of Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, and Chen Guangzhong of the Pingliu Hunan Army, as well as the Guo Huazong Division under Wang Jinyu of Pingxiang, to form a joint defense and transfer a large part of the army to suppress southern Jiangxi. At this time, they are not anxious to eliminate Kong's bandits, but to block their way out, so that they become trapped.</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi: Ganzhou is where the main bandit troops are located. Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue are concentrated here, occupying Ningdu, Luokou, Guangchang, Dongbei, and Xingguo. Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue are at odds with Zhu De and Mao Zedong, but they have become inseparable and must consolidate their position in order to struggle. Because they have been fighting for thousands of miles and have suffered heavy losses, they are actively coercing the people to join and replenish their forces, and building fortifications to defend against government troops without the intention of moving far away. The government army has not actively advanced for the following reasons: (1) In view of the previous failures, they will not advance lightly until each army has reached the designated location and obtained reliable communication. (2) They fear that a hasty attack will cause the bandits to flee elsewhere, hindering the annihilation. (3) The areas of central Jiangxi are covered with thorns, and it is necessary to first weaken the bandits' wings before there are no worries. According to recent reports, there are occasional scattered bandits harassing west of Xingguo, seemingly coveting Ganzhou. However, these troops are scattered and unable to withstand a single blow. Considering the past, the communist bandits are accustomed to using strategies of leaving a voice and visiting the west. Gu Wenchang responded to Ying Fen's visit to his private residence at around 11:00. Yang Yuebin has been harassing Nanfeng and Lichuan in the east. How do we know that the bandits are not deliberately creating suspicion to confuse our army's vision and then sneak into Fujian through a side road? Fortunately, the anti-bandit authorities are paying attention to this (February 28).</p>
<h3 id="e49">He Yingqin Reports on the Bandit-Communist Situation in Four Provinces <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>▲At the Weekly Memorial Ceremony in the Nanchang Headquarters</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Yesterday, at the weekly memorial ceremony for the Commander-in-Chief held at the Nanchang Headquarters, He Yingqin reported on the situation of the bandit-communist groups Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Kong Hechong, Li Wenlin, He Long, Kuang Jixun, Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, as well as Li Mingrui in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian. He also urged the various departments to strictly guard military secrets and protect the people. The general gist is as follows: "Fellow comrades, upon the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, we have come to Jiangxi to handle the military affairs of suppressing the bandits. We have been in Nanchang for three weeks now. During this period, on the one hand, we have been investigating the situation of the communist bandits and planning a strict method of extermination. On the other hand, we have been concentrating and strengthening our forces from all directions, hoping to capture them all in one fell swoop without letting anyone escape. Now, the various armies are actively proceeding according to the predetermined plan. Today, taking advantage of the opportunity of the weekly memorial ceremony, I will report to you on the bandit situation in various aspects. (1) In the southern Jiangxi area, the major bandit groups of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue, claiming to number tens of thousands, in reality have no more than twenty thousand bandits. Most of the rest are coerced peasants, the so-called Red Guards by the bandits. They are now entrenched in Ningdu, Guangchang, Huangpi, Xiaobulekou, Donggu, Futian, Longgangxu, Pitou, and other places, all of which are currently under our military surveillance. It will not be difficult to gradually eliminate them with the advance of our main forces. (2) In eastern Jiangxi, the groups of Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, and Zhou Jianping took advantage of the emptiness of our Yushan defenses to seize Yushan. After our troops rushed to suppress them, they were defeated and fled into Mopan Mountain. Our Ruan division once defeated these bandits near Gangkou, capturing many of them. They are currently being searched and suppressed by separate routes. (3) In western Jiangxi, the groups of Kong Hechong and Li Wenlin are entrenched in the area of Maxu, Youju, and Tonggu Tieshuguan under the jurisdiction of Xiushui. Our Fifth Route Army has contacted the various units in eastern Hunan to carry out encirclement and suppression. They will be eliminated soon. As for the small groups of communist bandits in the areas of Xiajiang, Anfu, and Lianhua, who collude with local peasant bandits and occasionally create disturbances, they have been successively dispersed by our army and are being gradually eliminated. As for the bandits of Longgang Yanxia, who were previously dispersed by the Hao division, in order to prevent a resurgence, Commander Hao has been ordered to continue his efforts to suppress them. (4) In eastern and southern Hunan, the major bandit groups that originally existed have long been defeated by our army. Now, although there are scattered bandit groups in Zhangjiafang, Xiaohe, Dindushi, Fenglin, Cenchuan, Nanjiang in the Pingliu area, and Gaolong and Yanfang in the Chayou area, they are not a major threat. They are currently being suppressed by Commander Liu, while the military department is assisting in the establishment of people's self-defense organizations in order to eliminate the bandits in various areas. (5) In western Hunan and western Hubei, the main force of the He Long bandits originally had two to three thousand guns. After our armies in western Hubei, northern Hunan, and eastern Sichuan jointly suppressed them, these bandits have been repeatedly defeated. Now, in Shinan and Hefeng, there are fewer than a thousand guns left. It will not be difficult to exterminate them with one encirclement and attack. (6) The bandits on the border of Anhui and Hubei have been vigorously pursued and suppressed by General Commander Ji in connection with the units in eastern Anhui and northern Hubei. The bandit forces are extremely weak and easy to eliminate. As for Li Mingrui's unit, after being blocked and suppressed by our Eighth Route Army, their strength has been greatly reduced. They now have only three to four hundred guns. Although they have fled separately through Nongjiang in southern Hunan and Chongyi in southern Jiangxi, our Nineteenth Route Army is blocking them in front, and the Duan department of the Fourth Route Army is chasing them from behind. It will not be long before these bandits are completely annihilated.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in various aspects, although the areas where the communist bandits have spread seem to be very wide, in terms of real strength, they are not many. And although they claim to be so-and-so army and so-and-so division, and hang up a communist sign, in reality they do everything from murder and arson to rape and plunder. They are completely more dangerous than the previous bandits and bandits. They are nothing more than extremely evil bandits and bandits. Although the masses, under their brutality, temporarily endure suffering and follow them, once the national army arrives, after propaganda and persuasion, who would not want to abandon the darkness and turn to the light and repeat their peaceful and prosperous life? Therefore, we believe that once the suppression order is issued, the communist bandits, no matter how cunning, will not be difficult to wipe out in one fell swoop. However, in the areas where the communist bandits are entrenched, the masses have been deeply poisoned and suffered the most severely. In the future, after the military victory is achieved, we hope that the comrades in the party and government will work hard to fundamentally seek a method of rectification and rehabilitation, so that the masses in the bandit areas can be thoroughly cleared of the abyss of suffering and placed in a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Regarding this bandit suppression, we should pay attention to several special matters: (1) Military secrets should be absolutely protected. The most important thing in using troops is to know yourself and your enemy. Therefore, we should do our best to detect the situation of the bandits, but our own situation must not be made known to others. All our military plans, as well as the deployment of troops and the location of troops, have an absolutely secret nature. We must strictly prevent leakage or inadvertently publishing them in newspapers. Our comrades must understand the danger of leaking military secrets and take the protection of military secrets as their most important responsibility. (2) We should focus on fundamentally eliminating the communist bandits and not seek quick results in terms of the situation. In this bandit suppression, we must recognize that the Communist Party is the biggest obstacle to the National Revolution, that is, the biggest enemy of the Chinese people. We must use meticulous plans and preparations to fundamentally eliminate them. We are not satisfied with being able to recover a certain place in a month or half a month. We must accomplish the task of eliminating the bandit leaders, confiscating firearms, and pacifying the people before we can be considered to have achieved our task. (3) The bandit situation should be reported in a realistic manner. Since we have embraced the determination to fundamentally eliminate the communist bandits and have a fundamental plan for elimination, once the suppression order is issued, we will inevitably achieve success step by step day by day. (4) The people should be effectively protected. The army's suppression of bandits is aimed at seeking the well-being of the people. Therefore, it is appropriate to strictly abide by discipline, cherish the people, and absolutely not disturb the people. (5) Give the oppressed people a chance to reform. A general group of people were coerced into joining the communist bandits. We should treat those who were coerced without discrimination and give them a way to reform. Communist Party members who surrender themselves are especially welcome." (February 25th)</p>

<p>▲Huang Plans Three Post-Guangxi Rehabilitation Plans</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The newly appointed Post-Guangxi Rehabilitation Supervisor Huang Shaoxiong, after arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai on the 21st, and eager to resolve the Guangxi issue, took the night boat from Hong Kong to Guangzhou on the 23rd. He arrived at about 7:00 am on the 24th. Those traveling with him included Gong Jieyuan, Lü Jingqiu, Huang Weifang, Huang Fang, and more than a dozen staff members. Those from the political circles who welcomed him at the pier included Deng Yanhua, Director of the Department of Construction, Ouyang Ju, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and the head of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, and several dozens more. After Huang stepped ashore, he shook hands with the welcomers and exchanged brief greetings. Then, he took a car with Deng Yanhua and two others to the Tuisiyuan Garden in Dongshan to visit Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, for a long talk. Then, he mixed with a small number of old acquaintances to Tuisiyuan for lunch. After lunch, he went to Central Park with Chen Ce and several other former ball partners to play velvet ball to pass the time. In the evening, Chen Mingshu hosted a banquet at Tuisiyuan for Huang. Those accompanying him included senior officers of the headquarters and members of the provincial government and directors of various departments. It was not until 5:00 pm that the banquet ended. According to Huang, those who visited him said that he would handle the Guangxi situation in accordance with the central government's intentions. In the future, the downsizing of the Guangxi army will be allocated about 2 million yuan by the central government as demobilization expenses. It has been decided to abolish the division and brigade system of the Guangxi army. The whole of Guangxi will be divided into several defense zones with the establishment of garrison commands to engage in bandit suppression in order to seek local construction. According to Gong Jieyuan, a close confidant of Huang, Huang's plan for handling the aftermath of Guangxi province is: the first step is to divide the garrison areas and distribute troops to each area so as to engage in training; the second step is to conduct searches and suppress bandits and communist bandits; the third step is to organize the Guangxi Provincial Government. Zhang and the Guangxi army currently have about 20 regiments. In the future, the Post-Rehabilitation Supervision Office may be located in Nanning. According to Chen Shi (Chief Counselor of the Headquarters), who brokered the Guangxi peace talks, the central government will allocate about 1.6 to 1.8 million yuan to Guangxi province in installments. All matters concerning the reorganization of Zhang and the Guangxi army will be presided over by Huang Shaoxiong. In the future, it may be reorganized into three divisions. If Li Zongren, Zhang Fakui, Bai Chongxi and others decide to step down, the central government will give them titles and provide them with overseas expenses. If Li, Zhang, Bai, etc., actually step down and Supervisor Huang officially takes office, then the Eighth Route Army can withdraw from Wuzhou. (Evening of February 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Eighth Route Army Stationed in Guangxi Withdraws Steadily <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>▲Eighth Route Army Between Guixian and Hengxian Has Completely Withdrawn</p>
<p>▲Fleet and Air Squadron Return to Guangdong in Succession</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Guangdong to discuss the post-Guangxi rehabilitation plan, the Eighth Route Army stationed in Guangxi has been returning to the north in succession. It is estimated that the troops that have been withdrawing in the past few days will have completed their departure. The 63rd Division's Huang Zhiwen Brigade arrived in Guangdong in succession yesterday and today. The Chen Hanguang Regiment of the Garrison Regiment on the Dahe side also departed from Guiping to the east on the afternoon of the 20th and arrived in Wuzhou on the 22nd to temporarily garrison in Wuzhou pending orders. At the same time, the 59th Division's Yu Hanmou Regiment, stationed on the Binjiang front, has also withdrawn to Guiping. According to a military officer who returned to Guangdong from Guangxi, there are no Eighth Route Army troops stationed between Guixian and Hengxian. Huang Renhuan's Brigade opened to the area between Tengxian and Guixian yesterday. Since there is no trace of the Eighth Route Army in Guixian, the first reserve hospital branch and the wounded soldier reception centers of various divisions and brigades were completely closed on February 10. All medicines, equipment, and wounded soldiers were transported to Wuzhou to join the personnel of the first hospital and moved to Guangdong in full. It is estimated that there are more than a hundred officers and soldiers and a large batch of medicines and equipment. On the evening of the 21st, they were transported to Guangdong in six civilian ships and sent to the General Army Hospital for disposal. As for the navy, the vessels stationed in Guangxi during the cessation of hostilities included the shallow-water gunboats Pingxi, Jingxi, Zhixin, Longxiang, and Lichen. They are now being withdrawn along with the army. The Zhixin, Longxiang, and Lichen vessels returned to the Guangdong River on the 22nd. The other Pingxi and Jingxi Southwest gunboats were seized from the Guangxi army during the war. The authorities plan to return them to the Guangxi Post-Rehabilitation Supervision Office for takeover. The air squadron of the Eighth Route Army Aviation Office originally had three aircraft in the first squadron, leaving three aircraft in Wuzhou. There was also a small squadron of aircraft protection team stationed at the airport. On the 24th, the three aircraft had flown from Wuzhou to Guangdong. The staff of the squadron and the protection team also returned to Guangdong by boat on the 25th and transferred to the Guangsan train this morning. According to military sources, since the various units of the Eighth Route Army will soon return to Guangdong, the defense areas of each division should be designated in advance in order to be responsible for bandit suppression. It is now roughly planned that the 59th Division's Yu Hanmou Regiment will be stationed in the Xijiang Zhaoqing area, the 62nd Division's Xiang Hanping's regiment will be stationed in the Dongjiang Chaozhou Meizhou area, and the 63rd Division's Li Yangjing's regiment will be stationed in the Beijiang area. The Huang Renhuan Brigade of the Training Brigade and the Zhang Ruigui Brigade of the First Independent Brigade will be stationed in Huizhou and Shantou. The Chen Hanguang Regiment of the Garrison Regiment and the Li Zhiping Regiment of the Fourth Independent Regiment will be stationed in Qinlian. The Fan Dexing Regiment of the First Independent Regiment will be stationed in Zhongshan Shunde and the Li Jiezhizhi Regiment of the Second Independent Regiment will be stationed in Gaolei and the Fourth Independent Regiment will be stationed in Dongguan Shilong. As soon as the troops return to their defenses, they will begin their pacification work. (February 26th)</p>

<p>▲Various Armies and Divisions Have Implemented Demobilization</p>
<p>▲Various Departments of the Provincial Government Have Completed the Handover</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi rehabilitation problem has recently been on the right track since the new military commanders and provincial government commissions took office one after another. The various army commanders Fu Zuoyi, Yang Cheng, Yuan Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengshou, Sun Chu, Feng Pengzhu, etc., have returned to their defense areas and implemented demobilization. Before leaving Bingzhou, the various generals had concrete discussions on the issue of demobilization expenses and garrisons. The 450,000 yuan of demobilization expenses that Shang Zhen brought back from Tianjin have been distributed in advance. In addition to actively raising funds from the Finance Department, it is said that the 2 million yuan borrowed by the Northeast will be transported to Bingzhou and distributed when the demobilization pain points of the various armies are verified. The garrison of each army is currently planned to remain as it is for the time being. After the three divisions of Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and Sun Dianying are demobilized and transferred to the Pinghan Line, the entire province will be divided into several pacification areas and distributed equally. The generals plan to complete the demobilization within two weeks at the latest. It is not yet known who will be responsible for the verification. Jizhi Qiqiao of the Northeast declared that since the various armies have implemented demobilization, he plans to return to Shenyang within three or two days to report everything to Zhang and make requests regarding demobilization expenses and verification. The various military closure matters are currently planned to be handled by a military closure committee. The committee has been actively preparing for a very small scale. It is planned to draw from the headquarters and various related military agencies.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters decided to cancel the positions of Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan at the end of February. Xu and Yang jointly issued an order to Yang Chengyuan, head of the training regiment, ordering the regiment to be closed by the end of February. From March, all students will be sent to the Beiping Wutang to study further. In addition, the military grain depot, the railway transportation office, etc., are also being closed. As for military expenses, in addition to the eight divisions that have been formally reorganized according to the Tianjin plan, it has been decided that they will receive monthly payments from the deputy headquarters from March. The road protection and garrison armies have not yet been stipulated. The provincial party department believes that Shanxi is currently in extreme poverty and exhaustion, and the additional military expenses for road protection and garrison are beyond the ability of the Shanxi people to bear. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the central government requesting that the central government allocate all expenses in order to relieve the people of Shanxi from their difficulties. I do not know what the central government's intentions are.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, since the provincial government commissions took office, Shang Zhen has been busy reorganizing the provincial government and the internal affairs of the Civil Affairs Department. He is currently drafting various plans for the actual implementation of provincial administration. The handover of the Civil Affairs, Agriculture, Mining, and Commerce Departments has been completed. Finance is currently being maintained by the old director, Qiu Zengyi. It will be necessary to wait for the new director, Zhang Jixin, to arrive before the handover can be completed. Feng Sizhi, Director of the Education Department, has returned to Bingzhou from his home and has also gone to the department to inspect. The provincial government will strictly adhere to the laws and regulations of the central government in the organization of various agencies, and there may be some changes in the administrative personnel of various county governments and district chiefs.

<p>▲Feng Pengzhu Telegram to Discuss Resignation</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The personnel of the Jin Sui Garrison Headquarters have been very busy in handling the closure matters in recent days. Xu and Yang, the chief and deputy commanders, have been going to the headquarters every day to supervise everything. The salaries of all the staff of the headquarters and the salaries of the public officials of the various abolished military and political agencies will be fully paid by the end of February. The name of the headquarters will also be officially canceled, and a military closure committee will be formally established. All unfinished matters will be handled by the committee. From March, no officers will be appointed to the various troops. The military closure committee will last until the end of March. After the headquarters is closed, the various agencies will be merged into the provincial government or abolished. It has been found that the compilation section and the pension section under the military affairs department of the headquarters will be merged into the provincial government after the department is abolished. The Yucai Machine Factory, Yucai Steel Plant, Saltpeter General Bureau, and Military Telephone Wire Bureau will also be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. The Military Grain Depot, Special Party Department, Railway Transportation Office, Radio Management Bureau, Army Prison, Army Court, First Branch of the Grain and Clothing Bureau, and Second Branch of the Grain and Clothing Bureau will be abolished within a time limit. The demobilization of the various armies is currently underway. However, Feng Pengzhu, the commander of the Ninth Army, has sent a telegram to Shang Zhen to resign and request that Huang Guanghua, Gao Mingwen, or Chu Xichun, the three division commanders, be approved to succeed him as the new division commander. The remaining two division commanders will be reorganized into brigade commanders. (February 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Bandit Atmosphere Revives in Baodugu <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In the 12th year of the Republic of China, the giant bandit Sun Meiyao of Baodugu robbed a train in Lincheng and plundered passengers. It was a sensation that attracted attention both at home and abroad. Baodugu is located at the junction of the five counties of Lin, Tan, Fei, Teng, and Yi. The mountains and valleys are dangerous and secluded, and it has long been a nest for bandits. After Sun Meiyao was executed, his brother Mei Song (i.e., Sun Jingtai) still led the remaining bandits to occupy and cause trouble, which has not been suppressed. Last year, the authorities recruited him and reorganized him into the 27th Division. However, Sun's wild nature was difficult to tame, and he soon rebelled again. Now, his power is very strong, and the harassment is even worse than before. The nearby residents have suffered greatly. Sun's bandits also coveted Zaozhuang, which is rich and a major town in southern Shandong. On the 19th of this month, they suddenly sent dozens of bandits to attack Zaozhuang. Fortunately, the local militia fought bravely and repelled them. Chen Yaohan of the 26th Division has sent the 157th Regiment to Zaozhuang to take care of the situation. At the same time, Li Hanzhang, the brigade commander of the 85th Brigade stationed in Tengxian, also ordered the Hou Zhaolin Regiment stationed in Lincheng to make proper joint defenses with the regiment. Yesterday, the General Headquarters received a telegram from Division Commander Cao Fulin reporting as follows: (1) According to Li Brigade Commander Hanzhang's report, Hou Regiment Commander reported that after the 27th Division of Sun Meisong in Lincheng was defeated by the Central Army, the bandits still fled back to the Baodugu area north of Zaozhuang and carried out looting and killing. The Baodugu area has always been a bandit's nest. Local bandits have been recruited many times in the past, and there are many military uniforms. They often mix with soldiers, so the people cannot tell the truth from the fake. At 8:00 pm on the evening, dozens of bandits attacked Zaozhuang. Fortunately, the militia repelled them, etc. (2) According to Li Brigade Commander Hanzhang's telegram, due to the scattered remnants of Sun Meisong fleeing into the mountains, the local area has been unstable. Yesterday, Division Commander Chen Yaohan sent his 157th Regiment to Zaozhuang to take care of the situation and ordered his brigade stationed in Lincheng Hou Zhaolin Regiment to make proper joint defenses with it. Respectfully reported by Cao Fulin (February 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Tianjin Telegraph Office Implements Reception of Submarine Cable <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the negotiations on the recovery of water and electricity have been carried out, they have attracted much attention from all parties. Originally, it was scheduled to be received on December 22nd of last year. However, due to the disagreement between the Ministry of Communications and the submarine cable company, it could not be implemented on time. On the 24th of this month, the Tianjin Telegraph Office received an order from the Ministry and, in order to facilitate the reception, made temporary provisions. The order was to obey and briefly stated that from February 26th, all landlines between Dazhan Tianjin Beiping used by the Eastern and Northern Companies and the internal newspaper rooms of the Pingjin Telegraph Offices, together with machines and furniture, should be returned to the Chinese Telegraph Office for reception and management. The personnel working in the company's newspaper rooms in Pingjin will be managed by the business managers of the Pingjin Telegraph Offices. The original general managers of the companies in Pingjin will temporarily serve as technical consultants for the two offices. The remaining foreign employees of the company will be temporarily allowed to stay as assistant technical staff and reporters of the submarine cable to assist in technical affairs and report. These foreign employees will be commanded by the current business managers of the Pingjin Telegraph Offices. The method of transmitting domestic and foreign telegrams on the Shanghai Smoke Dazhan submarine cable will be handled as before. After receiving the order, the Tianjin Telegraph Office was consulted by Director Zhao Manlin and Business Manager Li Jiqing. Li also discussed the reception procedures and methods with the foreign managers of the Eastern and Northern Companies. At 9:00 am today, Business Manager Li, accompanied by reporters Lin Zhaoxiang, Shen Yanbi and others, went to the two company's newspaper rooms to take over the machines, furniture and other items. All landlines between Pingjin and Zhan, which were previously lent to the company, were also recovered. The affairs of the two newspaper rooms are now under the full management of Li. After completing the reception procedures, Zhao Manlin, Director of the Telegraph Office, and Li Jiqing, Business Manager, reported to the Ministry of Communications in the name of the reception committee. Business Manager Li also announced to the employees of the Telegraph Office and the new employees who originally belonged to the Eastern and Northern Companies that they should work together to promote the progress of reporting. The telegram is recorded as follows: Yuyou" (February 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Russian Bandits Attempt to Rob Shenyang HSBC Bank Unsuccessful <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: At 4:00 am on February 26, five Russian bandits in a car suddenly broke into the HSBC Bank at the Sankong Road in the Shenyang Commercial Port Area from the east. Each held a handgun and first went to the staff dormitory, where they used ropes to tie up the bank's Chinese staff, including Chu Ji and others, and forced them to tell them the location of the money and wealth storage warehouse. The bank staff immediately replied that there was no money. The Russian bandits searched the savings room and asked Chu for the key to open the cabinet to retrieve the money. Chu replied that there were a total of three keys, which were divided among the German, French, and Chinese managers. The three of them are not currently living in the bank. Seeing that there was no way to do it, the Russian bandits used an axe to completely split open the three iron locks on the safe. Due to the lack of a key, they could not open the last steel door despite their best efforts to chop it open. Seeing that too much time had passed, the Russian bandits were afraid of being discovered outside, so they had to return to the dormitory and search for the money around the staff, losing more than 60 silver yuan in total, and then went out the door to get into the car and drove away. The bound employees of the bank bit the ropes and broke free with their mouths, rushing to the Commercial Port Public Security First Branch to report. After Zhao Guanru, director of the branch, led the police to pursue the Russian bandits, they were no longer to be found. A police post was originally set up in front of the bank. On the day of the incident, the police officer Liu, who was on duty, had entered the basement boiler room to warm up due to the late night and cold weather and was sleeping soundly, so he did not notice the robbery. After the fact, the first branch of the Commercial Port investigated the previous situation and detained Liu for dereliction of duty and awaited punishment. (February 26th)</p>

<p>Plainclothes Police Investigate Gambling, Causing Disturbances: On the evening of the day before yesterday (25th), at around 10 pm, dozens of people speaking in different accents, wearing plain clothes, and carrying guns suddenly arrived in Yangshuyuan Town, District 16 of Wuxi. They rushed to Zhang Shuntai's tobacco and paper shop on Zhongjie Street and broke open the door to search. Because the merchants and residents of the town had been robbed in previous years and had recently received extortion letters, they were like frightened birds. Upon hearing the alarming news, they suspected that a major disaster was coming and fled in panic. Later, after the Chamber of Commerce dispatched people to investigate, they learned that it was Han Weian, the official of the 14th Branch of the Zhangshe Public Security Bureau, leading the entire team to the town to investigate gambling. Because most of the police officers were in plain clothes, the merchants and residents did not understand the truth for a while and rushed to flee. The police officers suspected that they were gamblers and pulled people indiscriminately, almost causing a conflict. Fortunately, the Chamber of Commerce maintained order and no trouble occurred. Afterwards, all the merchants and residents of the town were extremely indignant that the police officers of the branch bureau had disturbed the public order by investigating gambling late at night. They unanimously joined together to file a complaint with the County Government and the Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Bandit High School Student Escorted to the County for Interrogation: The Shangqu Defense Corps of the First District of Wu County captured Gao, a bandit high school student, and sent him to the Provincial Guard 3rd Platoon at Yang Kai Bridge for detention. At 2 pm one day, Cheng Jingzhong, the platoon leader of the team, escorted a platoon of soldiers to the city and sent him to the County Government for interrogation. County Magistrate Zhang personally appeared in court at 10 pm to interrogate him. Gao initially gave an extremely cunning confession, saying that he had not committed any crimes and had only two or three guns. After strict questioning, he finally confessed that he had more than thirty guns and more than two hundred accomplices. Yang Yaoda and Hua Hongxing (who had been captured by the Provincial Guard and sent to the county the day before) and Xu Genbao were indeed accomplices. He had commanded the bandits to kill more than a dozen people twice with guns at the Machouli Pan Shu Qiangmen and Machouli. He had also committed arson, kidnapping, and extortion in places such as Dingyan, Majiatou, and Jiagang, about seven or eight times. Although there were many other cases, he could not remember them. After committing the crimes, he knew that he could not survive, so he fled to Changzhou or Shanghai, and then to Zhaiqiao to sell soup dumplings for a living. In short, he had robbed people of amounts ranging from 150 yuan to 500 yuan to 801 yuan, and he had taken the most, etc. The county magistrate ordered him to be detained. Li Leng, the magistrate of Jiangyin County, learned that Wujin had captured the bandit Gao and immediately telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department of the Wujin County Government to transfer him to Jiangyin for interrogation. He also sent Fang Qi, the police chief of the county, to Changzhou with a letter to negotiate the reception and transfer. When County Magistrate Zhang interrogated him, Team Leader Fang also participated in the interrogation.</p>

<p>The Baojin Isle School Rent Case Resolved: Since receiving the approval of the Education and Finance Departments to entrust the Zhenjiang and Yangzhong Education Bureaus and Zhenjiang Middle School to take over the management of the Baojin Isle school rent, negotiations with the county government to take over have been repeatedly stalled, causing delays until now. It is now known that the Education Department has fully understood that the case is entirely due to the former County Magistrate Xu Zusheng embezzling and disobeying orders and refusing to hand over the property. The Civil Affairs Department has been consulted to detain the former magistrate's secretary and Finance Section Chief, Qian Sui. Upon learning of this, the Zhenjiang Education Bureau sent Section Chief Xue Zhenglin and others to Yangzhong to join the Yangzhong Education Bureau to take over the property. Negotiations have now been finalized, and the formal takeover will take place on the afternoon of the first day.

Please comply with this for the sake of public interests.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau sealed up the Zhabei Confucian Association and its private academies set up to collect money under false pretenses, after verifying the facts. The original letter to the Public Security Bureau is as follows: "According to the repeated petitions of unqualified private tutors in this city regarding whether the purpose of the Zhabei Confucian Association is pure, staff members were dispatched to investigate the association at Xingjia Muqiao, Xin Jia Road, and Huo Yuan Lane on February 6th. It was reported that the association has a building with a stall selling books downstairs and a private academy upstairs. The private academy was previously sealed up by this bureau last autumn. However, the academy has been revived and has defied the order to set up a school while this bureau is cracking down on private academies. It also collects money under false pretenses. It was verified that Gong Gaoxiang, the tutor of the academy (the son of Gong Heting, the organizer of the Confucian Association), was treated sincerely by the staff member in the capacity of a tutor. Gong said that the academy has been registered with the Education Bureau and the private academy named Kongzi Pingmin Xuan Shu Jiangxi Guan has also applied to the Education Bureau for registration. He asked the staff member to join the association for a fee of three yuan per year and to pay tuition to become a correspondence student for six months. After graduation, the association would negotiate with the Education Bureau to exempt him from being banned. He said that his teacher Fang Shiguan and his friend Yao Minghui have a close relationship with the Education Bureau, but the public relations activities would cost a lot of money. He then showed the staff member the Confucian Association's propaganda brochure, which stated that they would set up propaganda halls to encourage people to learn to read and that propaganda members would help the people to establish schools, such as 'You Zi She Zi Di Ji Guan' and 'Tong Meng Li Xue Di Ji Guan.' It is verified that the association is collecting money under false pretenses. It is hereby requested to consult the Public Security Bureau to seal up the association and the academy immediately and to publish the news in various newspapers to prevent the tutors from being deceived."

<h3 id="e72">Shao Lizi, the President of China Public School, Takes Office and Swears In <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>China Public School held its commencement ceremony and the inauguration and oath-taking ceremony of the president at the school's auditorium at 9:00 am yesterday. Attendees included Gu Shusen, the representative of the Ministry of Education, Pan Gongzhan, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Cen Dezhang, the representative of the Municipal Government, Deng Zhenquan, the commander of the fortress, as well as Hu Shuhua, Chu Minyi, Zhang Shiyong, Wang Jingqi, Xu Peihuang, the new president Shao Lizi, the vice president Zhu Jingnong, and all the faculty, staff, and students of the school, totaling more than a thousand people, making it a grand event. The ceremony proceeded as planned. First, President Shao reported that China Public School was founded to resist imperialist cultural aggression and occupies a glorious position in the history of Chinese education. He felt inadequate to serve as the president of Zhonggong due to his talents and learning, and he also apologized for not being able to be stationed at the school full-time due to his official duties. He added that the unfortunate incident at the school was not the fault of any one person, but rather the result of a bad environment. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to take over and changed the college to a department. Some students may be dissatisfied with this. However, it should be known that learning does not depend on the size or name of the school, but on the pursuit of practical knowledge. Moreover, all citizens cannot exceed the scope of government management, and they should absolutely obey government orders. Otherwise, the students' mission to learn will fall into a great mistake. In the future, the students must work harder in their studies in order to contribute to the support of the people of society and the approval of the board of directors. He intends to find ways to add a college of science or a college of engineering in the shortest possible time, but at present, due to limited funding, he can only gradually develop according to the department's regulations.</p>

<p>Gu Shusen, the representative of the Ministry of Education, said in his speech that the recent upheaval at the school was deeply painful and that the waste of money and the abandonment of studies were even more regrettable. The resolution of the board of directors was not implemented during the upheaval. This stable phenomenon occurring in the highest institution of learning is truly alarming. The Ministry of Education has adopted decisive measures. It is a pity that the school, which has been carefully established, has been discontinued. Therefore, I was sent by the Ministry along with Mr. Cen and Mr. Zhu to take temporary custody and order all students to leave the school. This method was originally intended to give the students a chance to think quietly without any other malicious intentions. Later, the board of directors publicly elected Mr. Shao Lizi as the president and Mr. Zhu Jingnong as the vice president. Mr. Shao is an advanced member of our party, and Mr. Zhu is an expert in education. The future development of the school will be immeasurable. Yao, the martyr of this school, said in his will that "the mission of China Public School is to create qualified true citizens and talented people to save the times." In the future, I hope that you will strive to complete this mission and live up to the great hope of the founder, Yao, who sacrificed his life for the school. The Three Principles of the People are defined by the Ministry of Education as the core educational ideology. Students should study hard and sincerely embrace it in preparation for saving China in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Pan Gongzhan, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said that Zhonggong has a glorious and revolutionary history in the history of Chinese education, which has been explained in detail by the government. However, it is a big mistake for ordinary people to think that opposing the government is revolution. It should be known that revolutionaries should engage in destructive work and resist the government during the warlord dictatorship. Now that the government is carrying out the Prime Minister's instructions and working hard on construction, students should earnestly study knowledge for the benefit of future generations in order to be called true revolutionaries. If they do not know how to study hard, ignore the needs of the times, and purely engage in destruction, they are not worthy of being called revolutionaries.</p>
<p>▲ Vice President Zhu gave a speech. Finally, President Shao answered and introduced Vice President Zhu. Vice President Zhu said in his speech that he was a member of the school who returned to China to resist the Japanese student regulations. He recalled that at the beginning of the school's establishment, most of the people in charge of the school and the internal students were members of the Tongmenghui, and the Three Principles of the People were embraced. Moreover, the students at that time were very autonomous. If they made a mistake, they would impeach themselves and never conceal it. In the future, I hope that you will do your best to preserve this glorious history and live up to the expectations of the founders for you to advance. There were also speeches by President Jiao Quanli of Datong, President Hu of Huda, President Liu of Shanghai University, and Mr. Liu Nanhai of the school's board of directors. The speeches were lengthy and will be omitted. Finally, photos were taken for commemoration.</p>

<p>Zhu Jiaxuan, the president of National Central University, was ordered by the Central Government to come to Shanghai to inspect party affairs. Yesterday, he was invited by Tao Baichuan, the principal of Jingye Middle School, to give a speech at the school's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. At 10:00 am, all the faculty, staff, and 400 students attended. Tao Baichuan presided over the meeting and Zhu Jingchun recorded it. After the chairman delivered an introductory speech, Zhu delivered a speech on the following points: First, he hoped that secondary school students would pay attention to the exploration of knowledge and the cultivation of character as a foundation for future studies and work. Second, he hoped that young students would use their spare time to engage in physical exercise to train their bodies and minds so that they would not be exhausted when they devote themselves to society in the future. Then, Jin Zhiqian, the director of academic affairs of the school, gave a speech and reported on academic affairs until the meeting adjourned at 12:00.</p>

<p>Gan Chunquan, a staff member of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, and Lu Yuanlei, the Director of Academic Affairs of the Shanghai National Medical College, considering the societal need for specialized personnel in Chinese writing and bookkeeping, have jointly established a practical vocational supplementary night school at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Hualong Road. The school adopts a course selection system and a credit system. Those who wish to study Chinese, bookkeeping, English, Chinese typing, or English typing can freely choose their courses. Furthermore, due to the credit system, students can enroll at any time and graduate upon completing enough credits, regardless of gender or age, as long as their academic level is adequate to pass the entrance exam. Recently, most institutions have been using Chinese typing. If one studies at this school, they can acquire the necessary skills in a very short period to meet the needs of society. Enrollment has already begun, and it is said that the number of applicants is quite large.</p>

<p>▲ Impressions of Traveling Around the World</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Industrial and Social Affairs Colleges of National Labor University invited Cheng Shewo, who had recently returned from Europe and the United States, to the school to give a lecture on "Impressions of Traveling Around the World." The lecture began with an introductory speech by Zhou Bangshi, the Director of Education, followed by Mr. Cheng taking the stage. He provided a detailed analysis of the modern political and economic situations in Europe, pointing out their causes and effects, and asserted that China's current priorities are to achieve practical peace and unification. Secondly, it is necessary to implement industrial plans based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. If this is done, the paradise on earth will not be in the West, but in China. In between, he elaborated on various facts and stories he saw and heard in various European and American countries.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Shanghai Basketball Association games were noteworthy in all three groups. In Division B, Qingnian defeated Ying in overtime by one point, with a score of 28 to 27.

<p>▲ Qingnian defeats Ying Team (Division B, Group 1)</p>
<p>The game started at 6:30 PM. Qingnian has been winning every game and has a good record. Ying Team surprisingly performed well and had accurate long shots. Qingnian almost lost. After the game started, Qingnian had an advantage, but then Ying Team worked hard and the score became 16 to 15. Qingnian won the first half by one point. The situation in the second half became even tighter. At the end of the time, each team scored 25 points. In overtime, Lin Zequn of Qingnian made a free throw. Cheng Jingxing of Ying Team made a long shot, and Chen Xizhong chased after two points. As a result, Qingnian won with a score of 28 to 27. The referee was Qian Yiqin.</p>

Huadong refused to show weakness, and Qian Jingyong scored, making the score 10 each. After that, Tongji's momentum became stronger, and the score took the lead. Huadong could only follow behind. At the end of the first half, Tongji won with a score of 24 to 15. After the break, Feng Nianhua, a young hero from Huadong, scored first. Tongji then added five points in a row, with a difference of 12 points. Huadong rallied and tried hard to advance.

<p>▲ Meigong defeats Laoda (Division A)</p>
<p>Although Laoda was strong, it was ultimately no match for Meigong. From beginning to end, it was at a disadvantage, and the score difference was quite large. The first half was 18 to 7, and in the second half, Meigong's lineup was often adjusted, and Laoda only slightly improved. However, it also used all its efforts.

<p>▲ Result: Score of Five to One</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Xianyan Seriously Injured and Leaves Field</p>
<p>｜Shanghai Team Performs Excellently, Lacking Luck｜</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondent) On February 23rd, a light rain fell, and the field was muddy and unsuitable for the game. However, the exhibition match between the Shanghai Inter-City Football Team and the Hong Kong Army, Navy, and Air Force Combined Team still proceeded as scheduled. The seats were sold out early, and the Shanghai team had to leave Hong Kong today, so it had to proceed as scheduled. Yesterday, the field was extremely muddy, and running was difficult. The Shanghai team was in a difficult situation, but it still performed excellently at times. However, the soldiers, who were used to fighting in the water, although the art was rarely seen, fought bravely and scored an unusual record of five to one. The Shanghai team's defeat was a matter of fate and not a crime of war. At the beginning of the game, the two sides lined up as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Army, Navy, and Air Force</p>
<p>Ya Jianxuan, Da Chen, Mao Lian, Yao Wen, Ai Nang, Hu La, Shu Shi, Jian Nade, Jian Chen, Ya Jian Shi, Da Weisi, Ha Lishi</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Team</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Meng Luo, Ma Ding, Bao Deheng, Ga Xu, Fan Enshi, Ge Tishi, Hui Tuo, Mo Xinke Lai, Tong La, Sha Li, Ai Tuo</p>
<p>▲ Misfortune Strikes, Enemies Trap</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai team's performance was still the best in the entire game. Jian Nade and Ai Nang of the Army Combined Team also performed well. The first goal was won because Zhou Xianyan accidentally committed a three-step holding violation due to Davis's entanglement. Davis took the penalty kick and shot fiercely into Zhou's leg and into the net. After passing the midline, Ge Tishi crossed, and Xin Ke Lai dribbled straight up, leading Ya Jian away from the goal, and then pushing the ball into the net. The loss of the two goals was only five minutes apart. Not long after, Shi Jian Nade dribbled the ball and crossed, and Ha Lishi rushed forward and shot fiercely. Zhou Xianyan had already caught the ball in his hand, but because of the crowd and the slippery ball, it fell back into the net. In the first half, the soldiers took the lead with a score of two to one.</p>
<p>▲ Iron Gate Injured, Hope Lost</p>
<p>In the second half, the performance of both sides was even more agile. Ha Lishi took a corner kick. The ball reached Zhou Shoumen and was punched out with his fist, but there were many people in front of the goal, and no one knew how the ball suddenly fell into the right corner. Zhou Xianyan was injured in the waist by Ya Jian Shi and could not move. Xin Ke Lai retreated to be the goalkeeper. The forwards were weak, and the soldiers had no worries and attacked desperately. Da Jian Chen and Ya Jian Shi each made a contribution. At the end of the game, the soldiers won by a score of five to one.</p>

<p>▲ Cheng Yize Donates Large Silver Cup</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Yize, the president of the Youyou Sports Association, is known for promoting sports. Recently, in view of the lack of opportunities for people in the industrial and commercial sectors to practice sports, he initiated an amateur basketball tournament. Because the matter was just starting and there was a lack of staff, he only invited ten basketball teams with equal skills, all of which were composed of basketball teams from the industrial and commercial sectors. Mr. Cheng donated a large silver cup, named the Youyou Cup, and 24 medals to reward the champions and runners-up. It is reported that the competition will be held around the 10th of this month at the Youyou Basketball Court. Members of the Shanghai Chinese Sports Referee Association will be invited to serve as referees. It is expected to end in about a month. The competition next year may have a larger expansion. The large silver cup donated by Mr. Cheng is currently on display in the window of the Tiantian Sports Equipment Company on Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Explanation of Shangsi Festival <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The two characters "Shangsi" are well known on the third day of the third month, just as the fifth day of the fifth month is called "Chongwu" and the ninth day of the ninth month is called "Chongjiu," all having the same meaning. Therefore, the third day of the third month is also called "Chongsan." Now that the old calendar has been abolished and the national calendar is followed, the good days of the past can be replaced. For example, the tenth day of the tenth month is like the refreshing weather on the third day of the third month. If we want to change customs, this "Shangsi" festival should not be forgotten. I believe that it should be recorded today and should not be lingered over in the abolished calendar.</p>
<p>After examining the character "ji" in "Shangsi," it is different from "ji" and "ji." Those who are illiterate cannot distinguish them at a glance. After careful examination, they seem the same but are actually different. "Ji" is read as yang li qie, meaning to have an end. "Ji" is read as ju li qie, meaning to refer to oneself. This is the difference between "ji" one and "ji" one, and they cannot be confused. As for the character "ji" in "Shangsi," it has a different explanation, like saying that in the third month, the yang qi has been released, the yin qi has been hidden, and all things have become patterned. Therefore, "ji" is a snake, and the image is shaped like a figure. Therefore, in terms of the zodiac, the year of "ji" belongs to the snake. This can be verified. Furthermore, according to Han Shi Zhang Ju, the customs of the Zheng Kingdom on the "Shangsi" day of the third month are to hold orchids to summon souls and continue the soul at the two rivers of Zhen and Wei, to dispel misfortune. The custom of "Shangsi" did not originate from the flowing wine cups on the winding stream during the Jin Dynasty. Wang Yishao was only following the rhymes of his predecessors. Moreover, since the Wei Dynasty, only the "third day" has been used and not "ji." Also, according to the rhyme supplement, "ji" and "ji" are not distinguished. Now, those with hooks are used as "ji" at the end, and those without hooks are used as "ji" at the end. The original meaning of these two characters has not been clarified. Therefore, this article is written to explain the "Shangsi" festival. As for the classics, I have already described them separately to avoid complexity.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Gleanings from the Zhonghua Public Entertainment Association <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Public Entertainment Box Office held a New Year's entertainment party at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on February 27th and 28th. The repertoire included 28 plays, and all participants were very happy. The situation seen is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Yuan Ludeng, Angry and Hair Standing on End Mr. Yuan Ludeng is addicted to drama. After work, he often goes on stage with friends to play roles for entertainment. He sings old Sheng roles and is able to perform many plays. He can learn the gestures and tunes immediately. Because he holds many positions in the business community, he cannot practice fully in advance. However, he is naturally intelligent. Although he does not practice his voice, he naturally matches the beat when he is on stage. This time, he played Boyu in the Zhuangyuan Pu, scolding Chen Daguan and standing on end with anger. His singing and acting were excellent, and he was reasonable and meticulous. Mr. Yuan originally had the translation number of Lao Bobo, so that night, Gong Zhaoxiong, who sang the black head, shouted from the stage, "Lao Bobo, don't get angry!" Boyu is the Lao Bobo of Chen Daguan, and the words have a double meaning. Everyone was amused.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Xiaolin's Stage Introduction Mr. Shen Tianxin recently filled the role of an amateur actor. Yang Xiaolou recently gave detailed instructions on various secrets of Changbanpo. After being encouraged by friends, he performed on stage. The performance of Changbanpo was different from usual, in order to be solemn, Zhang Xiaolin went on stage to introduce, saying that Shen Tianxin played Zhao Yun and got the true biography of Yang Xiaolou. Mr. Shen is a famous family in Huzhou. He served in the Army Department during the Qing Dynasty. After returning south, he served as a member and director of the National Business Federation and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Since handing over the Suzhou Customs Supervision and the Negotiation Envoy, he has been indifferent to officialdom and enjoys living in Shanghai. He has put a lot of effort into this play. After the report was finished, the performance began. Mr. Shen's white speech was clear and his skills were skilled, so the applause was thunderous.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Qiaqing Enters Wulongyuan The association posted a red paper on the stage on the second day, saying, "The stage is narrow, please do not go on stage." Unexpectedly, when Mr. Yu Qiaqing arrived at the meeting on the second night, the stage was full. The waiter should give special treatment because Mr. Yu is a leader in the Shanghai business community and a permanent director of the Elegant Song Collection. He made an exception and led him to the stage to sit behind the table. At that time, Luo Qu Yuan and Zhang Jingqiu were performing Wulongyuan together. A certain gentleman next to him said that the guests were refused to go on stage today, and now Mr. Yu went. He entered Wulongyuan. Those who heard it smiled.</p>
<h3 id="e87">What I Heard About Gelao Lane <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Yingchuan Qiushui</p>
<p>Gelao Lane in Shanghai County is said to be demolished because it obstructs the road and is dangerous. This lane was originally built by Xu Guangqi, a Wenyuange University scholar in the late Ming Dynasty. Guangqi was a fellow villager and translated Euclid's Elements of Geometry by the Greek and had works such as Nongzheng Quanshu. From this, we know that Guangqi today is not only a pioneer in his hometown but also a mentor of science. The lane was built in the late Ming Dynasty and completed in the early Qing Dynasty, which is nearly three hundred years ago. Whether it should be demolished or not will not be discussed for the time being. However, I heard people say that Qiao Zhao, the Zhejiang Admiral in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, was known for his bravery before he was promoted. One day, a horse suddenly came in front of the county office and galloped east and west, and no one could control it. Zhao happened to pass by and chased after it and captured it. The horse still did not accept the reins. Zhao jumped on it and held its mane with all his strength. The horse became even more angry and galloped wildly. Zhao happened to pass under the lane and jumped unexpectedly, clamping the horse's belly with both feet. The horse jumped into the air, and Zhao held the horizontal stone under the three characters "Gelao Lane" and would not let go. The horse then lowered its head and dared not move. Zhao then let go and jumped down, and the horse was tamed like a good horse that was not worthy of his strength. The rumors are like this, but there is no evidence in the Shanghai records. It may be that Qiao Yiqi's story in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty was mistakenly passed on as Qiao Zhao's story. It is also unknown whether Yiqi once clamped the four hooves of a wild horse in the air. The story is seen in the Tongzhi Shanghai County Chronicle. However, Yiqi was before Guangqi, so it is inconvenient to put it together. Therefore, everyone mistakenly believed it to be Qiao Zhao's story. Wait for someone with extensive knowledge to verify it.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Anecdotes from the Hawthorn Case <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>My friend Cheng Xiaoqing's Hawthorn detective novel has been famous in the literary world for many years. Xiaoqing himself said that he did not write his life's detective novels to gain fame, but they are not as good as Conan Doyle in terms of quality and quantity. He has already surpassed Sherlock Holmes in terms of quality. The recently published compilation of Hawthorn detective novels is one of the crystallization of his hard work. Xiaoqing's residence is a small building with several rooms on the bank of Fengxi Creek in Wumen. He has the elegance of poetry and books, the sun, the moon, and the seagulls. He often walks alone in the suburbs and woods, often forgetting to eat while moving. He uses this outdoor scenery to conceive detective stories. After the conception is obtained, he immediately returns to the room to write a picture, from A to B, from B to C, D, and from C, D to E and F, which is the step of his detective stories. After the tortuous picture is completed, he tries his best, or between A, B, C, and D, there are still clouds and waves that can be described. Therefore, Xiaoqing's writing of detective stories is more difficult than any other type of novel. The most painful thing is to meet the book seller's request to limit the number of words to two or three thousand, which is not enough to write freely. Five or six thousand words are redundant and have too many superfluous words. It is not as good as the automatic writing, which is appropriate and accurate for each piece of 12,000 words. There is always an assistant in the detective stories, just like Watson and Sherlock Holmes. Bao Lang is Hawthorn's assistant. Zhao Zhiyan and Xiaoqing are good friends and come in and out together. The peers call him Bao Lang, and Zhiyan smiles and seems to have tacitly approved. Xiaoqing once worked in a certain department of Soochow University. A certain Western woman, a colleague, loved to read his detective stories and encouraged him to translate it into English to introduce it to a certain Western magazine. Xiaoqing also excels in Chinese painting. Many Westerners buy it and ship it across the ocean to display it in their country. The Taoist Western Line, my friend's front delivery is unlimited.</p>

<p>— Chen Danyuan</p>
<p>The garden is named after hard work to record its labor. However, physical labor is not beneficial to the world. Yan Shili, the so-called labor of San Zhi, is probably moved by justice. He thinks about saving the world with his academic methods. He once said that if there is one person in the world who cannot understand his own bright virtue, then the bright virtue has not been understood in the world, and the world cannot be called peace. With painstaking efforts, I heard that I was moved. Mian Garden is located on the side of Taiyi Peak in Lushan. It is not in the world, but on the ground. Bitan Bright Moon, Mountain Bird Spring Dragon reflect each other. The essence is half a house. Seeking to hide the heart, even if the king is facing south, it is not enough to change it. The flowers and trees in the garden are abundant and uncountable. When the morning sun first rises, the distant view of the sea of clouds is crystal clear, and the waves fluctuate, as if there is another world. During the leisure, he always lectures with the students, and sometimes invites the neighboring old people to open the Zun Chang drink, and does not change his happy people. Some people compare the teacher to Ziling. It is deeply felt that it is close to being unethical. Who dares to be the emperor Guangwu in this world? I regret that I did not read books for ten years. Even if I analyze Xin's cooking, I am ashamed that there is no such thing. However, understanding the reason, fulfilling one's nature, and obeying the teacher's training, I wrote this article and watched Yan Zhan Chi Chen Ronggui record.</p>

<p>— Spiritual Flower</p>
<p>That day, a stage play was performed in the temple. It was a Burmese play entirely with women dancing, their activity greater than our female roles. I saw them perform a puppet show, with bamboo and wooden animals dancing, the skill was quite impressive. Initially, two people performed an elephant fighting a tiger. Although the elephant was fierce, it was clumsy. The tiger jumped extremely nimbly, and eventually the elephant was defeated by the tiger. I don't know if tigers actually win against elephants. I guess scholars staged it with experience. A water bird swallowed a fish, the fish trying to avoid it in every possible way, but in the end, it was eaten. The struggle for power in the natural world is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>On the 7th, I read the English book "New Europe After the War" at the Pengcheng Hall, which stated that the Dutch colonies are 55 times larger than their mainland. Therefore, we know that the Netherlands' dominance in the South Seas is not to be underestimated. Also, the country is damp and without mountains. The nation even spends huge sums of over 100 million yuan, using machines to pump dry the seawater to build new villages, which can cover about 50 square English miles, approximately 300 square Chinese miles. Their great plan does not spare capital. Jingwei filling the sea, the Foolish Old Man removing the mountain, Westerners truly have this foolish sincerity. But you don't need to go to the Netherlands to see such foolishness. In Hong Kong, you see many workers opening mountains and filling the sea. A small mountain has already been mostly opened up, and a large part of the sea has been filled. Many buildings have already been built, which is the former sea. The best thing is to combine moving mountains and filling the sea into one task, simultaneously using the stones from moving the mountains to fill the sea and build houses and erect buildings. Today, not only has the mirage been realized, but also castles in the air have become reality. The ideals of the ancients have all become reality today, which can also dispel all sorrows of the ages. Then, abandoning the nation and abolishing soldiers to achieve great harmony and even becoming immortals, the ideals of the ancients will also become reality for later generations. It is really hard to say.</p>
<p>On the 8th, a friend invited me to take an evening stroll near the outer city. The desolate scenery was fresh and clean, far surpassing Rangoon, with many trees and small rivers flowing through the streets, no dusty roads. The docks and streets were all built with iron bridges and iron railings, so they were very clean and beautiful. Living here is better than in Rangoon. The businessmen were Indian and Chinese, and the laborers were Indian Kalla people. A park was desolate. Many large bats hung upside down on the trees to sleep, their size larger than crows, which I had only seen in animal science textbooks before. The South Seas is a university for examining and investigating plant and animal species and human races. Mr. Lin Chaoying invited me to watch a Burmese movie. Movie tickets here are cheap, with two annas and four annas being common. The two of us spent one yuan and sat in the upper class, watching a noble princess running away for love, encountering tigers, elephants, and large snakes. I felt that the jungle scenery of the South Seas was very lifelike. There was also a female ascetic fighting an evil demon angel, unable to decide. I felt that the Burmese people's thinking was more noble than that of Westerners. I also watched a Chinese film, its elegance and delicacy also quite commendable. This is probably the expression of Eastern and Western societies. Also, from the women depicted in Burmese plays, one can understand the female-centered view of life, which is absent in China.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Financial Gold Market Situation Slightly Better</p>
<p>▲The situation is still stable. Yesterday, March 2nd, the gold standard seemed to be turning bullish, but the situation remained complex. A fluctuation of four or five taels was not unusual, and it was difficult to suppress the overall difference of twelve or thirteen taels in the city. However, the turbulence was slightly calmer than in the previous few days, and eventually rose slightly by more than three taels. The psychology of the industry was stable, but receipts and payments were quite different from the previous market. Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yongcheng, Fengyong, etc. all purchased, while Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmao Yong, etc. all sold. Overseas silver markets had reported gains the day before yesterday (Sunday), but gold prices were trending higher, which was due to news that a large amount of cash had been shipped out yesterday. Later, it was rumored that the cash shipment had encountered difficulties due to export insurance issues, so it was not actually carried out. Upon hearing this news, the market quickly turned downward, especially with sellers anxiously selling, causing a sharp drop of more than ten taels. Even drafts also showed weakness, but the listed price did not change and recovered its gentleness. Banks had a slight appetite, and the market regained strength, rising again by ten taels. Later, trading was limited, fluctuating around seventy taels with only three or four taels difference. The exchange planned to increase commissions from March 1st, but after discussion among the brokers the day before yesterday, a majority opposed it, so it was temporarily not implemented pending resolution. As for this morning, large bars may fall back, it is said.</p>
<p>▲The rise and fall are erratic. The April opening in the morning was 768.5 taels, adding two taels. Although large bars were longer by one-quarter, the forward price was three-sixteenths. The silver price added three-tenths, and private telegrams were the same, not swayed by the excitement of cash exports. Continuing to 74 taels, the atmosphere then weakened, and companies like Tongtaichang, Yuanmao Yong, etc. were all selling, immediately falling seven or eight taels. When the prime rate was announced, it was 66 taels, and the listed price did not move. The domestic market then loosened. Banks entered May English gold at 126.25, and sellers accounted for one-half. Furthermore, Yuda, Taixing, etc. sold, continuing to fall to 61 taels and 3 mace. Not long after, headhunters bought in, and banks absorbed May English gold at 125.625, raising it by more than six taels. By nearly 10 o'clock, it was 68 taels. In an instant, it retreated to 65 taels and 5 mace. Zhifeng Yong, etc. re-entered the market, adding English gold at 125.625, still available for sale. Xingye and Korea also traded May Citibank at 29.4375. At 10:30, it rose to 70 taels and 1 jiao, then suppressed and fell by more than five taels. Yuda, Qianchangxiang, etc. sold. At 11 o'clock, it was 64 taels and a half. Afterward, the fluctuations were still complex, only seeing an upward trend, hovering around 70 taels. After 11:30, Yongfeng, Hengyu, etc. chased and bought, reaching over 72 taels and 5 jiao at noon, recovering to 71 taels, then falling to more than 67 taels. Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng, etc. sold hedges. The quoted price was still 826 taels and 2 mace, pressing 64-65 taels to 54-55 taels.</p>
<p>▲The after-market is clear and stable. The afternoon opening was 69 taels, then 71 taels. Because Indian drafts were weak, four annas were eagerly sold, and English gold tended to loosen. The Sino-Japanese bank mutually traded April 125.625, so at 2:30 it was 66 taels and 2 mace. Subsequently, Yuanmao Yongcheng Fengyong, etc. successively competed to buy, and Mitsui Huabi absorbed April-May English gold at 5625, and bought US dollars at 29.5 yuan, presenting an upward peak, once again breaking through the 70 taels mark, to more than 71 taels at 4:10. However, there was a reversal of two taels from time to time, so there was no change due to scattered transactions at the end. At 4:30, the closing price was 70 taels and 2 cents, an increase of 3 taels and 7 cents compared to the previous Saturday. The maximum price for the day was 74 taels, and the minimum price was 61 taels and 3 mace, a difference of 12 taels and 7 cents. The morning price of goods was 71 taels, noon closing at 69 taels, and the afternoon opening market at 69 taels. The closing price was 70 taels and 2 cents, and the quoted price was 56-57 taels.</p>
<p>▲Receipts and payments differ. Among the same industry transactions, Zhifeng Yong, Chengfeng Yong, Yongfeng, Futaiheng, and Hengyu all entered, while Yuancheng, Shunli, Yuda, Yuhe, Yuantai, and Hengxingyuan all had entry and exit. Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Hengxing, Wanxing, Taixing, and Qianchangxiang all exited. In the afternoon, Chengfeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, and Futaiheng all entered. Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang Hengxing all exited. Wanxing Shunli, Yuantai, Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, and Taifengcheng all had slight ups and downs, but the number was not significant. The joint gang supplied more than demanded, exporting 1,500 items and importing 800-900 items. The Guangdong gang only sold 200-300 items throughout the day, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Foreign Exchange Market Atmosphere Loose <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates were the same as the previous Saturday. However, the bank's buying and selling prices were flat or weakening, while the afternoon prices were flat. As a result, compared to the weekend (February 28th), English gold was still 1.25 higher, US dollars were 0.25 higher, and Japanese gold was 1.25 lower. However, the gold market rebounded by three or four taels, yet there were still twists and turns of twelve or thirteen taels throughout the day. Chinese gold firms all had entries and exits, but trading was considered not bad. English gold traded amounted to about 300,000 pounds, and banks such as Shanghai, Sumitomo, and Taiwan all had entries and exits. Mitsui and Huabi sold slightly, then re-entered in the afternoon, and Hefeng sold slightly. Various banks also mutually traded tens of thousands of pounds and mutually transacted 200,000 US dollars. Mitsui and Huabi entered 200,000 dollars. As for Japanese gold, it was still scattered, and Chinese firms mainly sold. The market atmosphere in the UK and the US seemed loose.</p>
<p>▲The English exchange domestic market counted 1875 deviations throughout the day. The morning exit was another one shilling two pence three-seven-five. The buying price was four-three-seven-five. Shanghai first entered 5,000 pounds of May at the beginning of the morning, priced at four-three-seven-five. Then Huabi exited 10,000 in April-May, priced at three-seven-five. Huabi and Datong, Taiwan and Zhejiang mutually traded 20,000 in April, priced at four-three-seven-five. After 9:30, Sumitomo entered 5,000 in May, priced at six-two-five.

The closing exit price was still half a penny, and the buying price was five-six-two-five.</p>
<p>▲The US exchange domestic market showed a fluctuation of three-seven-five throughout the day. The morning exit price was 29.125 yuan, and the buying price was 25. Dongya exited, and Hefeng entered mutually transacted 50,000 yuan in May, priced at 29.5 yuan. Mitsui entered 25,000 yuan in April, priced at 29.625 yuan. Mitsui exited 50,000 yuan in May, priced at 4.375 (American Silver Company bought in). Xingye and Korea mutually traded 50,000 yuan, priced the same. The noon closing exit price was 29.375 yuan, and the buying price was 29.5 yuan. In the afternoon, Huabi entered 50,000 yuan in April, priced at 29.5 yuan. The closing exit price was 29.375 yuan, and the buying price was 29.5 yuan.</p>

The morning exit price was one tael seven mace, and the buying price was one tael six mace nine cents. The noon closing exit price was one tael six mace eight and a half cents, and the entry price was one tael six mace seven and a half cents. There were no changes in the afternoon. The closing price was still one tael six mace eight and a half cents, and the buying price was one tael six mace seven and a half cents, no different from a market with no transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Silver and Cash Market Simplicity Different <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>▲Market Overview: For several days, Qianzhuang have only been doing business in the morning market due to the abolished lunar New Year, and the noon market has not yet started. Therefore, the atmosphere of receipt and payment and trading is extremely cold. However, the business situation of banks has gradually turned busy, not as sparse as in previous days. Although not as busy as in the past, the situation is indeed much better than last week.</p>
<p>▲Interest Prices (Foreign Interest): This morning, the buying sentiment was better and prices turned higher, calculated as 7 mace and 2 cents interest, 7 hao half, which was better than the previous day, 7 hao half. However, the situation was still stable. (Silver Discount): Since business started on February 19th, the total amount of white borrowing has been opened every day, but half of the pawnshops have not yet recovered, and most of the transactions with customers have not started, so it is quiet and motionless.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: Jiangnan small silver coins changed to one cent less yesterday, calculated as 6 mace and 6 cents, trading 2,500 jiao.

<h3 id="e93">Qianzhuang Begins Sending Account Books <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Qianzhuang industry, both large and small, in this port roughly went to market after the general closing of accounts on February 15th. In reality, it is similar to not having opened for business. It has only recently been activated, preparing to start sending account books to customers' accounts, which is quite busy in the process. The time for sending account books varies among the entire industry. The earliest started on the 27th and 28th of last month, but many Qianzhuang and small banks generally delayed the distribution until after the end of the month (ie March 1st) for the sake of convenience in closing February accounts. Therefore, distributing account books was busiest yesterday and the day before, and the latest will be between today, tomorrow, or the 4th, 5th, and 6th. It is estimated that all will be distributed within ten days.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Major Changes in the Securities and Bond Market Yesterday <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>▲Prices Rose and Fell Sharply, Dropping Significantly Compared to Last Weekend</p>
<p>▲The Market Was Booming, with Transactions Reaching Approximately 22 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of various government bonds was that spot transactions were still only sporadic, but futures prices had major changes, and the market was very lively with buyers and sellers. All parties traded very actively. It is estimated that the two trading sessions in the morning market reached over 9 million yuan. The market was still active in the early market of the afternoon session, but the last session at the closing was slightly calmer. The changes in the market prices of various government bonds showed that the market sentiment was weak at the beginning of the morning, and the price was more tired than before. Later, due to bad news, the market sold off one after another, and the selling transactions were very enthusiastic. As a result, the supply and demand were very different, and the prices of various bonds gradually declined. The decline was very severe. The opening of the afternoon market was still strong, such as the disarmament futures fell by as much as 3.5 yuan, which was lower than before. The momentum of the closing session began to ease slightly, and it rebounded slightly compared to before. As a result, compared with the previous weekend, except for the 96 finance, 19 volumes, seven years, etc., which had no major ups and downs, other bonds mostly fell by one yuan to one yuan and eight or nine cents. It is estimated that the total daily futures transactions reached over 21.9 million, and spot transactions were only 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market trend is relatively soft, as actual sales are increasingly bleak, and various gangs are listless, resulting in a flat and tired market sentiment. However, a certain large household's market sentiment is still strong and there is no intention to release, as it is the spring selling season and the three-product yarn price is high due to exchange rates, so their bullish mindset is exceptionally strong and they refuse to let go. However, the key to spot yarn demand is the greatest, and with raw cotton difficult to loosen, the future of yarn prices is also difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲Rise and Fall of Labor Bids Mixed: The morning opening of the labor bid was characterized by a decline in Indian cotton and a dispirited market sentiment, with each falling by seven or eight cents. The afternoon opening was still flat, with each month falling by seven or eight cents. In the second and third sessions, the price of cotton rose and strengthened, with each month rebounding by four cents. The general notification was that the special margin for new transactions would be reduced from March 1st, with cotton yarn at six taels and cotton at two taels. The total daily transaction of labeled yarn was 24,000 bales. It was found that Yuda sold 2,550 bales, Jifeng 1,850 bales, and Rongxing 750 bales, while Changfeng bought 3,100 bales, Heshen 800 bales, and Mingde 900 bales, and Ruid 950 bales. The closing price of the labor bid is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>May 1749731050</p>
<p>August 1744 Up 1</p>
<p>▲Spot Yarn Sales Still Clear: Spot yarn sales are still bleak. It was found that the total purchase by each firm throughout the day was only 250 bales.

<h3 id="e96">Cotton Market Remains Stable <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲August and September Will Stop Filming to Avoid Danger</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the trend is relatively soft, while the buying attitude remains firm. However, Indian cotton sentiment turned down, and spot cotton transactions on the market remained quiet due to high prices, and factory offices were also slack. Japanese merchants were less active. The gold market remained stable, so new launchers still did not dare to proceed rashly. However, the counter remained tight, and the future became increasingly difficult to predict. It is said that filming for August and September will be stopped to avoid danger during the transition period.</p>
<p>▲Han Biao Continues to Soften: At the morning opening of Han Biao, Indian cotton fell again by five or six rupees, the market atmosphere loosened, and the number of households was lacking, with each falling by three or four cents. At the afternoon opening, the cotton industry held up for several minutes because the flowers in August were not filmed, and then each month rose by four or five cents. The closing fell back slightly, and as a result, each month still fell by two or four cents. The total daily transaction statistics were 33,400 piculs. It was found that Changfeng sold 3,400 piculs, Deji 1,400 piculs, Gongtai 1,500 piculs, and Yuda 1,700 piculs, while Xincheng bought 4,000 piculs, Meiji 1,600 piculs, Shenchang 1,200 piculs, and Tongxing 1,300 piculs. The closing price of Han Biao is listed on the left.</p>

<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday: Because the Suzhou River was crowded, few ships arrived from the mainland, and sales on the market were still active. The shape of white japonica rice became smoother in the store, and in addition, the weather was cloudy and rainy, so the higher-level rice continued to be firm. The near-cornered Bo Dao arrived at the barren sales and was eager to see the price rise. The outer Yang Dujian market situation was popular and the market sentiment was also good. The large disc was treacherous, and the half-foot became the original state of depression. Yesterday, the suspension of sales was thoroughly activated, so it rose with the firmness, and the inventory was thin, rising by one jiao.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai Yesterday: The sources arriving on the road successively, and the street shipments were normal. The situation of tin machine japonica rice was stable and the market was tight. The second level Ping Su Tong and various white japonica rice purchases were not strong, and the sales were only in small quantities. The price did not rise or fall much. The various southern gangs were active in the early rice from various parties, and the half-foot Yang Xian was in a steady state. The number of transactions was not large, the white Yuan market was quiet, the price was stable, and the sales were not transformed.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Tun Households Inquiring About Ke Xian <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market situation saw inquiries from merchants and hoarding households, and the market situation was quite lively. The Ke Yuan Jin gang stopped, and the Shantou gang resumed their operations, and the market situation was also quite firm. Moreover, the rain affected the wheat seedlings, and the Ke rice had no source, so the market sentiment was good. However, the gang customers did not have a large appetite, and the market price was high, so foreign rice could be smoothly handled in China. Therefore, the market price will not soar for the time being. A total of 130 bags of Hunan Yuan rice were purchased from the Shantou gang at a price of 13.85 yuan, 200 bags of Jiangxi Yuan rice at a price of 13.7 yuan, and 160 bags of Jiangxi Jiwan purchased by merchants and hoarders at a price of 12.47 yuan. 500 bags of Nanjing machine rice were purchased at 10.015 yuan to 10 yuan, and 600 bags of brown rice were purchased at 8.62 yuan, and 70 bags of Liu Cao were purchased at 9 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>▲The July Lower Period Has Already Been Filmed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean cake market trend was upward. At the morning opening, the prices of each month did not change much due to the wait-and-see attitude of the merchants. Until the afternoon opening, the telegraph firm turned around and the transshipment gangs eagerly purchased. The mainland gangs were quite inquisitive because the lower period of July had already been filmed. The association's current cake had the hands of foreign firms, and the market was also cute. Therefore, the market prices for each month near and far rose in unison. As a result, compared with the end of the previous month, the upper period of March July was large, the second half of April was large, the fifth month was large, and the seventh month was large and the seventh half the month The closing price for the lower period was 1 tael, 6 mace, 7 cents and 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Marked Powder Rebounds Strongly <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the price of each day's foreign wheat was reported to be a small, but it was not very prosperous. Due to the continued release of files by large manufacturers, the opening price was not very firm. The recent period was still due to the high opening price of the current flour (initially reduced by 1 mace and 8 cents, followed by a shout of 2 cents), and the far period was shouted again due to the large number of launchers. The opening price was very cute until the afternoon opening, when most people were optimistic, and although the manufacturers still issued guns, the strength of the buyers was not as strong. The buyers in the inner land were very strong in June, July, and August. It is said that there are still foreign preparations for the recent period, while the far period is purely native wheat. In the future, if the annual situation is good, it may turn stable, otherwise, it should turn optimistic. As a result, the current month is 1.25 cents larger than the end of the month, April is 1.25 cents larger, May is 1.7 cents larger, June-July is 2.5 cents larger, and August is 2.7 cents larger than the initial opening.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Wheat Market Bullish Due to Spring Rain <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened in the morning with the price of foreign wheat rebounding slightly by three or four jiao. The market seemed to have stalled, but then, because the harvests in areas like Hangzhou and Shaoxing were expected to be poor due to rain and snow, the purchasing of standard wheat surged again, and the market picked up. By the afternoon opening, customer sentiment remained firm and purchases continued unabated. The outlook for forward contracts was particularly bullish due to the cold and rainy weather. Opening prices for each month rose steadily. Although short sellers tried to capitalize, the improved environment rendered their efforts futile. However, the current price of Australian wheat is as low as 4.3 taels, so it remains to be seen whether this will cause a drop in the future. The standard weight for foreign wheat delivery was previously set at 144 catties, but has now been changed to 140 catties, which will make future foreign wheat deliveries cheaper. As a result, March contracts rose four fen compared to the end of the previous month, April rose six fen, May rose five fen, June rose one qian, July rose nine fen, and August had no comparison.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Market Sees Gradual Decline</p>
<p>▲Raw Granulated White Sugar: Over Two Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the sugar production areas. At the public exchange market, Dutch sugar No. 24, raw granulated white, was quoted at 11 taels, but there was little buying interest. Subsequently, the exchange offered spot goods at a price of 10 taels 9 qian 5 fen, before the market fell to 10 taels 9 qian. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 10 taels 4 qian, but there was also little interest. Imports and exports of Japanese sugar were also sluggish, and the market saw a gradual decline.

<p>▲Land Prices Rising</p>
<p>Tong'an dried longan sold at very low prices last winter, resulting in a shortage of supply. Arrivals this spring are also very scarce, as the market price cannot meet the costs. According to a customer letter, the Taiyuan Wheel of the Taikoo Company arrived from Xiamen with only a few hundred pieces. Land prices have recently risen by one or two yuan due to low stock. The cost is about two taels higher than the previous trade.</p>

<p>Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, silk factories in this and other cities were closed for more than ten days because the female workers stopped working voluntarily.

Over the past two days, Xin Fu and Yong Xing silk factories sold a total of twenty-six dan of "silk nests" at a price of 188 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, for both the Lu Zhuang and Tu Zhuang loose-leaf and pearl teas, French traders continued to make sporadic purchases due to demand from the Moroccan market. The selling price remained unchanged from last week. However, the stock of Zhen Mei tea is still over 16,000 boxes. Shrimp-eye pearl tea is already in short supply. Similarly, Gong Xi and Xiu Mei teas are in high demand from stores and shops, and it will not be difficult to clear the existing stock.</p>

<p>▲Consulting with Various Charitable Organizations</p>
<p>▲Completing Relief Work for Shaanxi Disaster</p>
<p>▲Firmly Declining Position as Supervisory Committee Member</p>
<p>Philanthropist Zhu Qinglan recently presided over the emergency relief effort for the Shaanxi disaster. Last year, he entered Shaanxi three times to handle disaster relief. In January of this year, he returned from eastern Shaanxi and then went to western Liaoning to inspect the flood situation. On February 22, he traveled south from Pingnan to Haizhou to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the Jiangbei Industrial Relief Qianghe project. He then took the Yongping Wheel from Haizhou to Shanghai, arriving at the Yipinxiang Hotel at 10 p.m. the night before. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., Mr. Zhu went to the Renji Charity Hall to convene major philanthropists to report on the disaster situation in Shaanxi in order to complete the relief work in Shaanxi. Mr. Zhu is scheduled to go to Tongzhou tonight for some consultations, and he should be able to return to Shanghai no later than seven days. Various charitable organizations in this city plan to host a banquet for Mr. Zhu and discuss fundraising methods. Furthermore, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Shiying, Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, and others, fourteen people in total, are scheduled to host a banquet at the Juelin Vegetarian Restaurant on Wengping Street, Sima Road, at 6 p.m. today (the 3rd) to welcome him. Invitations have been distributed to invite leaders from all walks of life in this city to attend. It is reported that the areas most severely affected by the Shaanxi disaster are Qishan, Liquan, Wugong, and Fufeng counties. Mr. Zhu personally visited these areas to investigate the disaster situation in detail and saved countless disaster victims. Yesterday, this reporter interviewed Mr. Zhu and asked him when he would assume his duties as a member of the newly appointed Supervisory Yuan's Supervisory Committee. He replied that he had been running around for various charitable causes for years and barely had time to rest. He really had no time to engage in other work and did not like holding empty titles without practical value. Therefore, he firmly refused to assume the duties of a supervisory committee member and had telegraphed Beijing to decline.</p>

<p>▲To Organize a Fundraising Association for the Shaanxi Disaster Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the North China Relief Association, arrived in Shanghai with his wife on the evening of the 1st to raise funds for the Shaanxi disaster relief. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, specially convened a discussion meeting with philanthropists at the Renji Charity Hall on Yunnan Road at 4 p.m. yesterday and welcomed Mr. Zhu. Wang Yiting, Wang Hanzhi, Zhang Xianqing, Wu Zhihao, Lin Kanghou, Zha Liangzhao, and others attended. Chairman Xu Shiying first gave a report, saying that Mr. Zhu, Chairman of the North China Relief Association, had outstanding moral character and literary talent, and his handling of disaster relief was particularly hard-working and tireless. Everyone originally intended to extend a grand welcome for this trip to Shanghai, but they deeply regretted that they did not know the time of his arrival. Now, everyone expressed their welcome with the utmost sincerity and wished Mr. Zhu good health. Then, Mr. Zhu stood up to report the details of the severe Shaanxi disaster (the detailed situation will be provided in a written report by Mr. Zhu, which is not recorded here). He also stated that in order to achieve thorough relief, it was necessary to think from the root and come to Shanghai to raise funds with various charitable organizations in order to proceed from the aspects of work relief, water conservancy, and education, so that the victims can have the power of self-reliance. Zhang Xianqing of the China Jisheng Association also gave a report. Finally, Wu Zhihao proposed that, while Mr. Zhu was in Shanghai, a fundraising method should be determined, and whether the name, location, and organization could be drafted first today, and then a date be set to convene various charitable organizations and chambers of commerce, banks, and money houses, and major philanthropists to carry out fundraising. It was decided to name it the "Shanghai Fundraising Association for Shaanxi Disaster Emergency Relief," and the location was set at the Renji Hall. It was planned to be established today, and the organization would be drafted at the same time. It was also planned to host a banquet on the 1st, where Mr. Zhu would report on the disaster situation and show a Shaanxi disaster film. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>▲Mayor Zhang Supervised the Oath on Behalf of the Central Government and Delivered Instructions</p>
<p>▲Over Four Hundred People from All Walks of Life Attended the Ceremony</p>
<p>The new Shanghai City Police Chief, Mr. Chen Xizeng, held a supplementary oath-taking ceremony at the bureau yesterday morning at 10 a.m. after taking office on the 11th of last month. Mayor Zhang, representing the Central Party Headquarters, supervised the oath. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Attendees: Central representative Zhang Qun, Central Committee representative Wu Bokang, Two Roads Bureau Chief Hua Weizhi, China Merchants Bureau Director Li Zhonggong, City Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Post Office Director Qian Chunqi, Songhu Defense Corps Commander Li Yingshi, Shanghai County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, and guests Zhang Shouyong, Zhou Peizhen, Liu Shufan, Wang Yiting, Ye Zhuotang, Yao Mulian, Wang Binyan, Gu Xinyi, Wu Yunqi, Ye Huijun, Wen Lanting, Zhu Yinjiang, Huang Jinrong, Yang Hu, Liu Zhancen, Zhao Jinqing, Lu Bohong, Jiang Yi, Huang Boqiao, Shen Junyi, Hu Hongmu, Jiang Dingwen, Yao Zengmo, and foreign guests including Chief of Police of the Public Concession, Deputy Chief Inspector Jones, Chief of the Special Affairs Department Qi Wen, Deputy Chief Inspector Shiweiye of the Public Concession Judicial Engineering Department, and all staff of the bureau, over 400 people in total.</p>

<p>▲Mayor's Instructions: This city is a hub connecting the capital, with bustling traffic and a mix of Chinese and foreigners, densely populated. In terms of its position, it is the center of national culture, economy, industry, and commerce. In terms of its situation, it is the screen and defense of the capital, a vital military town. The foreign concessions cut through the city, making it easy for thieves, bandits, petty criminals, and reactionary elements to escape and gather here. Therefore, the local security responsibilities of the police in this city are heavy and cannot be compared to those of other ports. Since taking office as mayor, two years have passed in an instant. I have actively carried out all municipal construction, hoping not to betray the entrustment of the Central Government and the expectations of the citizens. I have always paid close attention to public security, because it is the place where the lives and property of citizens are entrusted, and it is related to local security and stability, and the focus of attention of both Chinese and foreigners. If there is any negligence, how can I face the Central Government and my citizens? Therefore, I have been diligent day and night and have not had time to rest. The former director, Yuan Quan, has been responsible for handling everything based on the city government's policies and regulations for more than a year. His achievements are still good. Because he has other tasks, he has been allowed to resign. Director Chen has always been known for his decisiveness in handling affairs. He has a considerable history in the revolutionary process and is well-versed in military and police knowledge. He has served in Shanghai in recent years and is very familiar with the situation in this city. I have known the mayor for a long time, so I specially appointed him as the successor to the Director of the Public Security Bureau. Today is the day of Director Chen's inauguration ceremony. I would like to briefly state the following points of expectation: (1) Seriously maintain public security. Although the overall situation has been pacified, the reactionary elements from all sides have not been completely eradicated, and there are many thieves and bandits lurking and wanting to stir up trouble. Maintaining public security requires special seriousness. This is the first point to pay attention to. (2) Strictly train the police. The quality of the police determines the success or failure of public security. Without strict training, it is impossible to achieve perfection. This is the second point to pay attention to. (3) Strictly prohibit smoking and gambling. Smoking and gambling are harmful to society and are related to public security. Without strict prohibition, it is impossible to eliminate harm to the people and cold chaos. This is the third point to pay attention to. (4) Improve customs and habits. The Central Government implements political training, first to correct people's hearts. Customs and habits that are not suitable for today should be improved to establish the foundation of society. This is the fourth point to pay attention to. In addition, completing household registration, traffic, eliminating bad habits, consolidating internal affairs, and the police power issues related to road construction beyond the boundaries are all within the scope of the public security responsibilities that should be earnestly rectified and carefully handled. We are in this political training period and want to repay the party and the country by personally uplifting ourselves and setting an example to our subordinates. How can we complete the mission and live up to the expectations of the Central Government and the citizens? I sincerely hope that Director Chen will devote himself to the public security cause with his revolutionary spirit, be loyal to the party and the country, and be even more loyal to the citizens. I hope that he will strive for good governance and make progress every day. The mayor has high expectations for him. Encourage him!</p>
<p>▲Guest Speakers: (1) Central Committee Member Chu Minyi spoke of loyalty to his duties and defending the country with his consistent revolutionary spirit. (2) Xu Jinyuan, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, said that the military defends the country against enemies, and the police prevent reactionary villains from running rampant. Only by connecting the military and the police can the country and the people live in peace and work. (3) Wu Bokang, a member of the City Party Committee, spoke. (4) Ye Huijun said that he hoped that Mayor Zhang would retain the positions of officials who are loyal to their duties and remove those who are corrupt and engage in malpractice. Mr. Chen Yingshi's memorial tower outside Ximen stands tall, and anyone who passes by commemorates his great achievements in protecting Shanghai. The new director, Chen, is his descendant and should be able to fulfill his legacy of maintaining local order so that the people can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>▲Bureau Chief's Reply: Mayor, Commander Xiong's representative, Chief of Staff Xu, Central Party Committee Member Chu, City Party Committee Representative Wu, comrades, and guests, Xizeng was ordered by the National Government and appointed by Mayor Zhang to serve as the Director of the Public Security Bureau of this city. I know that my talent is shallow and I am deeply afraid of being overwhelmed. However, Chairman Chiang and Mayor Zhang have encouraged each other from Xizeng's past work and history in the revolution and have ordered Xizeng to shoulder this task, so I can only obey orders and strive to shoulder the public security task with the spirit of the revolution. The police are closest to the people, and are like a preventive drug in society that eliminates toxins and kills insects. Shanghai is the largest city in China, and society is very complex, so the diseases that occur are also the most numerous. Those who transport all kinds of drugs, the communists, and all other reactionaries, as well as kidnappers and robbers, all regard Shanghai as their general source. Therefore, the public security of Shanghai is not only a matter of Shanghai, but is related to the provinces along the Yangtze River, and even the entire country. If the public security personnel of Shanghai can work hard and fulfill their duties, they can at least reduce many hidden dangers in the provinces. The efficiency of the police is different from that of the military. The power of the military lies in destroying the enemies that have been discovered. The power of the police lies in eliminating the dangers that have not yet taken shape. Therefore, the duties of the police should be to work hand in hand with the people, share interests and concerns, so that the people will respect the police out of fear, and love the police out of respect. Then the force of the police can be said to be concrete and popular. Xizeng should preserve the achievements and scale of the previous Public Security Bureau, and dare not fail to work hard for the plans and progress of the future Public Security Bureau. We must ensure that the Shanghai police progress along with the progress of the municipal administration. In the future, when the municipal government's city center plan is realized and Shanghai becomes the first model city in the country, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau will also strive to reform and become a model police force in the country. This is the responsibility that Xizeng should fulfill, and it is also the responsibility that all members of the Shanghai City Public Security Bureau should fulfill. No matter how hard or difficult, we dare not fail to strive to complete our task, to live up to the expectations of the Central Government and the City Government, and to meet the needs of the people of the city. Xizeng himself is deeply afraid that his knowledge and experience are insufficient, and hopes that Mayor, Commander Xiong, Central Party Committee Member Chu, City Party Committee Member Wu, and all comrades will give guidance at any time. Today, I am very honored and grateful to receive the teachings of Mayor Xiong, Chief of Staff Xu, Mr. Chu Minyi, and Mr. Ye Huijun, and the presence of all comrades and guests.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Economic Director of the League of Nations, Salter, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲To Enter Beijing with Haas Within Days</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Salter, Economic Director of the League of Nations, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the British mail ship Loyal Prince and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. This reporter made a special trip to interview Salter, but he did not wish to express anything as he had just unpacked his luggage and had not yet officially met with the National Government authorities. Salter's trip to China was at the invitation of the National Government. It is rumored that the purpose of this trip is related to the 100 million pound gold loan led by the League of Nations to China, but it has not been confirmed for the time being. It is known that Salter has represented the League of Nations in handling the financial aftermath of Hungary and Austria with considerable success, and has also presided over the League of Nations' loans to Hungary, Austria, Greece, and Bulgaria. Salter is a British national who has served as the Economic Director of the League of Nations for many years. It is now heard that he will retire. There have been League of Nations personnel invited to China by the National Government in the past, including League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Avenol, Minister of Health Rajchman, and Director of the Labor Bureau Thomas. Now there are League of Nations Minister of Transportation Haas and Salter, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling five people before and after. Haas contacted Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun and others in Beijing and then came to Shanghai. He also stayed at the Cathay Hotel. Yesterday, he told this reporter that he was invited by the National Government to come to China and had met with government officials in Beijing and Shanghai many times. He will return to Beijing in the next few days to continue the contact. It is difficult to determine how long he will stay in China. The reporter then asked about the purpose of his trip to China, but the answer was vague. When asked whether it was related to the negotiation of the gold loan, he replied that he was not a financier and did not participate in it. The reporter then asked him if he had heard anything about the gold loan. Haas replied no. Haas is a French national and this trip to China is entirely on behalf of the League of Nations. It is now heard that Salter will enter Beijing with Haas within days to meet with the National Government authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Six Company Jianglun Alliance Raises Prices <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲Shanghai-Hankou Freight Increases by 30%</p>
<p>▲Effective from the 16th of This Month</p>
<p>▲North and South Seas to Increase Prices on May 1st</p>
<p>Gold prices have soared, and the operating expenses of various shipping companies have increased significantly, especially the hidden consumption of hardware used in the ships. Therefore, all water freight rates on the Jianghai routes are being discussed for price increases starting in March. Those who have already increased fees include the Changsha line and Chongqing line in the Yangtze River, which have increased by 20% and 30% respectively. On the coastal side, the Shanghai-Taiwan line and Shanghai-Ningbo line have each increased by 20%. As for the most important Yangtze River route, the six companies Taikoo, Nisshin, Jardine, China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ningshao have jointly proposed a business alliance, so the price increase of water freight is also included in the alliance's discussion. A result has been obtained and the details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Increased Water Freight: The six companies discussed the increase in freight rates for goods going up and down the Yangtze River at the second meeting to discuss the business cooperation plan. The meeting concluded that gold prices are rising daily, operating expenses are increasing, and the wages of crew members and sailors have been increased twice. In order to maintain business, it is necessary to increase the water freight price by 30% of the original amount, as with other routes. The agreed implementation date is from March 16th. The shallow water fee, which was increased by 15% last winter, is still retained. Even if it is abolished, it will be discussed after the 15th. After the agreement, the representatives of each company unanimously agreed to revise the freight rate table immediately and notify the customers for reference.</p>
<p>▲Alliance Decided: The six-company Yangtze River business alliance has been resolved at the second general meeting. The duration of the alliance is tentatively set for one year. The six companies will mutually disclose their business: (1) Unified transportation rates; (2) No private discounts; (3) Eliminate the practice of customers stealing and reducing weight; (4) Actual receipts and reports; (5) If there are differences in opinion on the alliance, opinions can be submitted within 90 days from the tenth month after the implementation of the cooperation and submitted to the association for public discussion to determine whether to continue the alliance in the second phase.</p>
<p>▲Discussion Methods: The sharing method for the implementation of the alliance still needs to be further discussed by the six companies, because the number of ships varies, the business varies, and each has its own special advantages and disadvantages in business, as well as specially agreed transportation contracts. It is not as simple as the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The China Merchants Bureau has a unique advantage in the Yangtze River shifts, such as Datong, Anqing, and Wuxue ports, which cannot be occupied by foreign ships. Once allied, it is inevitable that the bureau will suffer losses in this area, so the bureau also proposed that it should be retained and not included in the sharing item. Therefore, the sharing method of the six companies requires a long period of negotiation and detailed rules need to be formulated as soon as possible within two months. The principle of the alliance has been decided for now. Except for the details of the sharing, it will be implemented first.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>▲Overseas Fee Increase: After the six companies resolved the Yangtze River alliance, they continued to discuss the issue of increasing water freight prices on the North and South Seas routes. Taikoo, Nisshin, Jardine, China Merchants, etc. all have dedicated shifts at Tianjin, Yantai, Yingkou, Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, etc. Now, due to the loss caused by the gold price increase, it is proposed to increase the freight rates on the above routes. It was decided on the spot that the export freight rates for the North and South Seas will be increased by 20-30% of the original amount from May 1st at the same time. The details of the fee increase will be determined at the next meeting.</p>

<p>▲Arrived in Jinan at 1 p.m. Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Continue Flying to Beiping Tomorrow</p>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation's Beijing-Ping aviation line has been in trial flight for the past few days. The company received a telegram from Nie Kai yesterday reporting the whereabouts. It is learned that Mr. Nie and Mr. Zhang flew the Tianjin aircraft from Hongqiao Airport and stopped briefly in Nanjing. They arrived in Xuzhou at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday for the night. Nie and others also inspected the airport. After completing this, they flew away from Xu at 9:40 a.m. yesterday and safely landed in Jinan at 11:40 a.m. It was originally scheduled to fly to Beiping today, but Nie and others decided to stay in Jinan for another day to improve the airport because the Jinan airport is still not perfect. They will fly to Beiping again on Wednesday. As for Tianjin, they will stay there again when they fly back. Because Xuzhou, Jinan, and Beiping all have airports opened by the Aviation Administration that can be used, Tianjin's airport must be opened separately, so Nie and others will stay in Tianjin for a longer time. As for the official opening date of the Beijing-Ping aviation line, it depends on the results of the trial flight. It will be decided after Nie and others return to Shanghai. However, the staff at each station, three in Beiping and two each in Jinan and Xuzhou, moved to their respective stations yesterday to prepare for business.</p>

<p>▲ And inspection of various departments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry held its regular Memorial Week yesterday (the 2nd) morning. Prior to this, Vice Minister Zheng Hongnian was invited to visit the bureau to provide guidance and instructions. Zheng arrived at the bureau at 15 Bowu Yuan Road at 11:00 AM, having come from Zhenru and Jinan University. After the ceremony, Director Zheng reported on his hopes that everyone would work hard to fully demonstrate the bureau's mission, and not fail the government's entrustment and society's expectations. Next, Vice Minister Zheng delivered his instructions, saying roughly, "I have been unable to spare time before, and today is my first time attending the Memorial Week here. The staff of this bureau are mostly technical personnel, with fewer clerical staff. Not only must the technical aspects be scientifically focused, but so too must the clerical aspects. Inspection can be divided into domestic and foreign sections. Developing foreign trade is one of the General Manager's teachings, and inspecting commodities is the first step in that work, so the methods must be particularly precise to increase foreign credibility, and then the national economy will flourish. Our country's products, such as raw silk, tung oil, cotton, and tea, all used to occupy an important position in exports, but due to a failure to improve, they are now declining daily. In the future, in addition to serious inspection, we should also focus on research and improvement," and so on. After the instructions, he inspected all departments of the bureau. At noon, Director Zou and Deputy Director Cai invited Zheng to lunch at the Bankers' Association Club, with more than 20 key bureau staff members accompanying them. In the afternoon, he returned to 23 Yuanmingyuan Road to inspect the bureau's silkworm seed inspection department (the bureau established this department at that location because the original bureau site was insufficient) and the leather grading matters that were just beginning to be handled, in great detail.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Ministry of Industry Seeks Input on Industrial and Commercial Difficulties <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲ In order to find ways to help</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry issued a directive to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that after reviewing the files of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, member Xu Peihuang of the Industrial and Commercial Conference proposed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce inform the entire country's industry and commerce sectors to list their own difficulties, gather them for research, and find ways to provide relief. Wu Jian, director of the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, proposed that each chamber of commerce be responsible for informing each trade and guild to state in detail their business difficulties or successes, as well as their hopes for how the government could provide relief or assistance, and that the chamber of commerce present these at each meeting to promote commercial development. These proposals were all approved by the General Assembly. Considering that our country has a vast territory and it is not easy to know the actual situation of industry and commerce in various places, in addition to issuing separate orders, the original proposal is hereby copied and issued, ordering you to list the most recent facts and their difficulties and relief methods in each industry, without delving into empty talk or mixing in prejudices, and to quickly gather them together and report them, etc. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already notified the trade associations of this directive and will comply with it in a timely manner for verification and forwarding.</p>

<p>Since the head office appointed Shou Yicheng and others to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Economic Society, several meetings have been held to discuss the methods. The inaugural meeting was held at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Club at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The attending members elected Shou Yicheng as chairman, who reported on the purpose of the meeting and the head office's hope that the branch would be established soon.

<h3 id="e120">Exemption from Tax for Cotton Yarn Exports <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ Implemented from March 1st</p>
<p>Since the government implemented the abolition of transit duties on New Year's Day this year, cotton yarn and other items have been included in the consolidated tax, which began on February 1st. According to regulations, customs duties no longer need to be paid, and those already paid will be refunded. However, in the past month, the consolidated tax has been collected as usual, while customs duties are still being paid, which has already aroused appeals from yarn merchants and customs brokers. It is now learned that the Customs Tax Department of cotton yarn has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to stop collecting from March 1st. If export tax on yarn has been paid as consolidated tax, then exemption from taxation will be granted in order to comply with the principle of "one tax per item," but customs inspection will still be carried out as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Demands of Customs Brokers During Suspension of Business <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ Exemption from Customs Duties on Yarn and Cloth Subject to Consolidated Tax</p>
<p>▲ Pain Relief Requires No More Re-Inspection</p>
<p>Due to the Shanghai Transshipment and Customs Brokers Association's feeling that the customs had stopped yarn and cloth merchants from paying "black corner" permits, the brokers were subjected to heavy taxation and repeated inspection hassles and dangers. They resolved in a public meeting to suspend customs clearance from March 1st. Yarn and cloth merchants have been greatly affected by their suspension of business. Although the customs and the consolidated tax bureau have reached an understanding, business has still not resumed. Shi Zikun, chairman of the Transshipment and Customs Brokers Association, went to various parties again yesterday to negotiate. In the afternoon, he convened a meeting of representatives from various trade guilds and the Yarn Mill and Cotton Cloth Association at the Qingyun Lane office to discuss the matter. Shi Zikun reported that the Jianghai Customs had received an official document from the Consolidated Tax Bureau stating that machine-made local goods should be subject to regular tax, and that customs duties would no longer be collected on yarn and cloth subject to consolidated tax. The customs has agreed not to collect it, but the inspection procedures still need to be followed, so the customs brokers believe that the pain has not been relieved. They vowed not to resume business until the goal of one-time inspection and no more re-inspection is achieved. Representatives from various trade guilds also expressed their agreement with the idea that the procedures were too slow. Next, the discussion turned to whether the trade should bear business tax by increasing brokerage fees. Representatives from various trade guilds did not agree, and the meeting ended without a result.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Party Headquarters Opposes the Sale of Housheng Yarn Factory <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Please Urgently Stop the Sale by Local Municipal Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>▲ Then ask the Ministry of Industry to Prepare Funds to Take it Over as a State-Run Enterprise</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that since the news of the sale of the Housheng Yarn Factory to the Japanese became known, all circles have paid close attention. The Third District Party Headquarters and the Thirteenth Sub-District Headquarters of this city have also declared their opposition. Wang Yiting and Gu Xinyi sent a letter to the Guomin News Agency yesterday denying that they were intermediaries in the sale and saying that they had never heard of it. The declaration of the Party Headquarters is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Third District Party Headquarters (above omitted) I have read today's newspaper and have been informed that the Housheng Yarn Factory was recently sold to the Japanese Gongda Yarn Factory for 3.4 million yuan. Upon reading this, I was shocked and surprised. The Housheng Yarn Factory is one of the larger-scale Chinese-owned yarn factories. It has been established for a long time and has more than 20,000 spindles. When the government is making every effort to promote domestic industry, and the Ministry of Industry is even issuing 50 million yuan in public bonds to establish five major factories such as cotton spinning, selling a yarn factory that is relatively large-scale and has been established for a long time to Japanese merchants is self-contradictory, giving foreigners endless ridicule. In addition to submitting a request to the superior party headquarters to jointly stop the sale with the Social Affairs Bureau, the Ministry of Industry should prepare funds to take it over as a state-run enterprise in order to uphold the fundamental goal of protecting domestic industry. I also hope that people from all walks of life will unanimously advocate to prevent the infiltration of Japanese merchants who are invading our country's industry. This declaration is hereby made in the hope that it will be understood.</p>
<p>▲ Thirteenth Sub-District Headquarters of the Third District (above omitted) All newspaper offices should be aware that our country's industry is nascent, so the people are more than doubled and the money flows out. In the past 20 years, the Chinese people have tried hard to create it, and they have been able to slightly block the leaks. The weaving industry can only be roughly built. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, it has been created and operated in various places. Since the European War, more spindles have been added, and the vigorous atmosphere seems optimistic. However, according to a calculation of the content, the national 4 million spindles are operated by our Chinese people, only about 3 million, and the rest are mostly owned by Japanese merchants. Since Hongyuan was swallowed by both internal and external forces, Baocheng was sold to Xihe, and Huafeng was also managed by the Japanese. Chinese factories are weak in capital and have poor technology. The weaving industry is largely monopolized by Japanese merchants. In recent years, gold has been expensive, and imported goods are unfavorable due to high exchange rates. This is the day when the yarn factory reorganizes its banner and sees the dawn again. It is said that the Housheng Yarn Factory in this city has 60,000 or 70,000 yarn spindles and more than 1,000 looms. It is only because the authorities' speculation has failed that they have not hesitated to sell the huge factory, which has been operating for a long time and is well-known throughout the country, to the Japanese Gongda Yarn Factory. The news is infuriating. I have already submitted a request to the superior party headquarters to stop the factory from selling and to find ways to help. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau strictly ordered the factory not to transfer it to foreign merchants privately. Fangji hopes that the storm will subside and be reorganized soon. I heard that on the 28th of last month, a shareholder of the factory, Xue, led 20 or 30 Japanese people from the Gongda Yarn Factory, taking seven cars to inspect the machinery in the factory, and it was also heard that a draft contract had been signed for 2.3 to 4 million yuan to decide to sell it. These sad and mad capitalists do not hesitate to endanger the foundation of the country and make a crime for imperialism. It is difficult to count. It is found that Japan has recently been suffering from the industry in this country, and the gloom has spread throughout the country. It has long intended to transfer the spindles to China and to swallow the Chinese factories. If there are no traitors inside, its aggression will not be able to achieve the desired results. The Housheng shareholders, who have been paying tribute to the thieves and have other lungs, have millions of private property. If they have a slight setback, they are unwilling to maintain it. According to its economic situation, it is not at the end of the mountain. There is no way to save it. Even if they are unwilling to operate and work hard, they should also think about the country's lifeline and transfer it to the Chinese merchants. There are many rich people in the words. The government may have a good plan to replace it and maintain it. It will not even be sold to the country's actions to send the factory. This is what my domestic compatriots should sigh and hate and gnash their teeth. My division has been hurt by the scene and cannot bear the fall of the giant factory to the hands of foreigners. In addition to asking the superior party headquarters to save it as soon as possible, the people of all walks of life should be asked to rise up together and oppose it. The time is urgent and Lin Ying is overwhelmed with grief.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Preventing Agricultural Associations from Being Controlled <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲ Oppose the District Agricultural Association as the Basic Organization</p>
<p>The First District Agricultural Consolidation Association of this city presented a letter to the Municipal Party Department's People's Training Association yesterday, stating (above omitted): Since the promulgation of the Agricultural Association Law and the implementation of the Agricultural Association Law, many days have passed, but the organizational system of the agricultural association in this city has not yet been officially announced by the party and government organs, so the original farmers' organizations in each district of this city do not know how to end or reorganize. I recently saw in the newspaper that the Seven District Party Headquarters of this city has requested the central government to interpret the difficulties in preparing for the agricultural association. The points listed are all true and consistent with the association's suggestions. However, according to recent news, some districts in this city, such as Pu Song, Gaoqiao, and Tangqiao, have organized district agricultural associations. At first, I did not understand why they were so easy to prepare and I had so many difficulties. Could it be that the farmers in Pu Song and other districts have already been well-trained and know the importance of organizing agricultural associations? However, after investigating the facts, the so-called initiators are mostly municipal committee members, district heads, and local security officers. In this case, it is doubtful whether they will be able to represent the majority of farmers' wishes in the future. It is also heard that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is also planning to use the district agricultural association as the basic organization. When asked how to obtain the consent of more than one-third of all those with agricultural association membership qualifications after the initiation, there is an implication that it is not necessary to investigate all of them. In this case, the agricultural associations in each district of this city will inevitably be monopolized by a small number of local gentry. It would be more appropriate to call such an organization a "Director-Bao Joint Association" rather than an agricultural association. (It is heard that the municipal committee members of each district held a preliminary meeting to implement the Agricultural Association Law. Mr. Yang Xinzheng, a municipal committee member of Caojing District, said that the district's Bao can be the initiator.) According to the association's opinion, the organization of agricultural associations in this city, which is important and has a large population, should have a basic organization under the district agricultural association, which would make training easier and more popular, and the effectiveness of the agricultural association would be seen. If the above-mentioned situation is true, the 23 village associations, more than 1,500 members, and all farmers with membership qualifications in this district do not want any small number of gentry to control the district agricultural association.</p>
<p>In order to dare to express my humble opinion, I hereby submit this letter to the esteemed association, requesting that the organizational system of the municipal agricultural association be promptly announced, and that there should still be an organization of village agricultural associations under the district agricultural association to avoid being controlled by a small number of people. I humbly request your approval and guidance, which is truly for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e124">News on Preparations for the National Cotton Production Conference <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲ Discussing Methods for Overall Improvement and Promotion of Cotton Production</p>
<p>Since the China Cotton Production Improvement Statistics Conference was prepared, it has been actively carried out for one month and has gradually been completed. As the meeting date is approaching, the various situations are specially recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Letters have been sent to participate in this conference. The purpose is to connect the highest agencies in each province that are actually engaged in cotton planting, so that they can exchange reports on the national cotton production situation, get to know each other, and discuss methods for the overall improvement and promotion of cotton production and national estimation methods to meet domestic needs. Since the announcement of this news, letters from various places requesting to join have been exceptionally enthusiastic. Feng Zhaochuan, Zhao Lianfang, and Sun Yushu of the Agricultural College of Central University, Chen Yanshan of the Agricultural College of Jinling University, and Lu Bin of the Agricultural Science Department of Nantong University have reported their participation.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives from the agricultural, mining, industrial, and construction factories of cotton-producing provinces have been invited to appoint representatives to attend the meeting. It is now learned that the returned letters from the provinces include Lu Feishu-liang of the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department, Fang Junqiang of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Zhang Zecheng and Hu Pingchu of the Shandong Construction Department. It is heard that the cotton planting area in Liaoning is very large, but it is controlled by the Japanese, so the Liaoning Agricultural and Mining Department has also returned a letter to the meeting to appoint representatives to attend the meeting. It is heard that the remaining provinces are also in the process of appointing them.</p>
<p>▲ Meeting proposals In addition to the proposals put forward by the initiators, the proposals from all parties have been prepared in advance and are now being sorted and compiled. The content of the proposals is roughly divided into (1) reasons and (2) methods.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' reports Representatives from each province have detailed reports on the cotton production situation in their respective provinces. The content is roughly divided into three points: (1) the current situation of cotton production, (2) past improvements, and (3) future plans.</p>

<p>▲ The Final Contract Should be Signed This Week</p>
<p>▲ People in the Company Say There Will Be No Significant Impact</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that representatives of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific telegraph companies went to Beijing on Sunday night and are expected to sign the final contract this week. People in the company say that the new contract will not have a significant impact on the company's position. In addition to China's recovery of the auditing and sending rights, it is expected that there will be no major changes in terms of telegraph services. Even the apportionment of telegraph fees, based on current signs, the company may not be able to have a more advantageous position than before. Expanding telegraph services and increasing revenue, in terms of receiving and reporting telegrams, are still entirely under the company's control before landing, and only after landing will they be transferred to the China Telegraph Bureau for transmission. Outgoing reports are still handled according to banana processing. The original personnel will also not be changed.</p>

<p>▲ Trial of the Xin Kang Ship Case The Japanese Yachiyo Maru of the Japanese Postal Company collided with and sank the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Kang ship in Chengshan Bay, Shandong, killing dozens of crew members and passengers, and losing 1 million taels worth of goods. Claims were repeatedly made to the Japanese side, but were rejected. The China Merchants Bureau then filed a lawsuit, which was accepted by the Shanghai court. After repeated inquiries from the Commercial Bureau, the first court hearing was held a few days ago. At that time, the defendant from the Japanese Postal Company did not arrive, and the court could not judge due to the absence, so the hearing was adjourned to a later date. Yesterday was the second hearing, and the China Merchants Bureau submitted a complete list of losses and a report on the accident to the court. This case is of great importance and cannot be concluded in one or two hearings. It is currently being heard.</p>
<p>▲ Naval Academy Students Set Sail The Naval Department dispatched students to England to study naval warfare and other academic subjects, led by the English consultant of the Naval Department, Mr. Peters. They arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and purchased tickets on the British Postal Ship Kai Fa to set sail. Today, the students will board the ship at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Previously, the Kai Fa caught fire in Dalian, and 22 second-class cabins were burned, causing great losses. The shipowner has now repaired the damaged cabins with cement, and will carry out major repairs after the ship arrives in London.</p>
<p>▲ Ministry of Industry Official Loses Son The Ministry of Industry issued a directive to Shanghai yesterday, stating: According to a report from Ministry official Ye Zhaochang, his son, Ye Guobin, who was studying at Aurora University, went missing on February 15 and has not returned home. A description of his appearance and clothing is specially provided, and Shanghai's wheel bureaus are requested to notify each wheel to carefully investigate and, if found, detain him and send him to Beijing. Ye Guobin is 15 years old, speaks with a Huai'an accent, is 4 feet 5 inches tall, has yellowish-black hair, and is wearing casual clothes. Yesterday, each wheel bureau relayed the message to each commercial wheel, ordering them to pay attention to the investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Continued Operation of Maritime Insurance The Shanghai Maritime Association, which initiated the establishment of the Maritime Insurance Company last year, has decided to dissolve due to insufficient subscription. The 4,000 taels of share silver received from Datong and other companies were returned by the Navigation Association yesterday. However, in order to take care of the interests of the crew members and sailors, eight wheel bureaus, including China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning Shao, and Zhao Xing, decided to organize a maritime insurance company separately. The share capital is recognized by the eight bureaus and underwrites the crew members and sailors of the eight companies. In the future, if an accident occurs, compensation can be obtained as consolation. Yesterday, Chen Bogang, chairman of the Navigation Association, invited representatives from eight companies to the Tongxinglou to discuss the progress of the establishment. Its charter is already in the process of being drafted.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Armed Drama in Front of Gaochang Temple <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲ Navy Artisans Beat Up Tram Ticket Seller</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, a tram on Route 4 of the China Merchants Tram Company, which was heading from Ximen to Gaochang Temple, was passing Bansongyuan Road when it met a tram on Route 1 heading from Gaochang Temple to the Bund. As they crossed, eleven naval airfield artisans who had recently moved to Shanghai from Mawei boarded the tram. When the ticket seller asked them to buy tickets, the artisans refused, and a conflict arose. After Liu, the patrol chief of the Chenjiaqiao Police Station at Gaochang Temple, came forward to mediate, the artisans bought three-cent tickets each. At that time, both sides exchanged sharp words, and the artisans looked angry and seemed ready to resort to violence. Wang Zuocai, the ticket inspector of Route 16 of the China Merchants Tram Company, witnessed this situation and, fearing that it would cause trouble, followed the tram to inspect it. Unexpectedly, when the tram arrived at the Gaochang Temple terminal, the artisans were all standing in the tram and continued to argue with the Route 16 ticket inspector. A second conflict then arose. The driver of tram 30 also stepped forward to mediate. At this time, the police officer arrived on the scene, and the artisans began to get out of the tram one after another. The ticket seller of Route 70 and the ticket inspector of Route 16 then grabbed Zhang Likang, the leader of the artisans, and handed him over to the police officer, who took Zhang Likang to the Gaochang Temple Police Station and transferred him to the Naval Aviation Headquarters for review. A storm was brought to an end. At 8:15 PM that night, the Route 4 tram and the Route 1 tram of the China Merchants Company arrived at the Gaochang Temple station one after another. While the trams were parking, dozens of people resembling artisans were waiting to board the trams. Unexpectedly, when the ticket seller of Route 83, the ticket seller of Route 77, and the ticket seller of Route 108 of Route 1 got off the tram and went to the ticket pavilion to sign their tickets, the artisans wanted to retaliate and shouted "beat them!" They took out iron implements and began to use violence. The Route 83 ticket seller, Wang Quansheng, was injured in the left waist and internally. The Route 77 ticket seller, Chen Guanfu, was injured in the head and shoulder. The Route 108 ticket seller, Zhou Qiurong, was also injured in the collar and arm. Wang Zhifa, the driver of Route 69, and Dong Zhaoxiang, the driver of Route 83, and Luo Yunqi of Route 30 were all injured in the arms and waist. However, the Route 77 and Route 108 ticket sellers were seriously injured. When the company learned of the above-mentioned situation, it immediately reported it to the Second District Headquarters of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and sent police to suppress the situation. The injured six people were sent to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The artisans dispersed. Later, the company sent a letter to the relevant authorities to negotiate. After the tram workers convened a meeting, they asked the company to guarantee their safety and wanted to go on strike and stop traffic. Zhu Shaoqi, the company's traffic manager, repeatedly comforted them and explained that traffic was important and should continue as usual. The matter should be settled only after the court makes a public judgment. Therefore, the trams on each route still left the factory as usual yesterday and were all running. From 12:30 PM onwards, the Gaochang Temple trams only ran to the South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Traveler's Suicide <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Impoverished and Oppressed by Economic Hardship</p>
<p>▲ His Letter to His Father Was Especially Heartbreaking</p>
<p>A traveler, approximately 25 or 26 years old, arrived at the Kaitai Inn at 422 Tianjin Road at the end of last month. He was wearing a fur coat and had a respectable appearance. He booked room number 26 and identified himself as Hong, with the given name Shanxian, a native of Hubei. He paid five yuan for the room. He went to sleep quite late the following night. Around 10:30 AM yesterday, he still had not gotten up, but groaning sounds were heard from his room. The tea server immediately reported this to the accounting room. They forced the door open and found the guest, Mr. Hong, lying stiffly on the bed, his face discolored. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, where it was determined that he had ingested poison. He died despite efforts to save him that afternoon. After receiving the news, the police sent detectives to room number 26, where they discovered four letters. One letter was addressed to the deceased's family, and another was to his maternal uncle, Zhong Hengping, who practiced at the Yiji Store at 80 Ruilin Lane, Sanyangjing Bridge. Upon learning of his nephew's death, Zhong sent someone to handle the funeral arrangements. It was claimed that the deceased's real name was Jianqiu and that he was originally from Nanjing. The names "Shanxian" were likely aliases. He had previously worked in Hangaou but came to Shanghai after losing his job, hoping to find a new place to settle. Unfortunately, his plans did not materialize, leading him to commit suicide. Consequently, his letters contained expressions of economic hardship and various disappointments. The deceased left behind parents and a wife. His letter to his father was especially heartbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Letter from Chen Zhirun's Mother <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲ Too Miserable to Bear Reading to the End</p>
<p>▲ Chen's Suicide Was Due to This</p>
<p>On February 27th, a man named Chen Zhirun from Wuxi checked into the Renhe Inn on Xinmin Road in Zhabei. He stated that he was 30 years old and a merchant, but he did not pay the room fee. When the tea server asked him to pay, he replied that it was not yet time to pay. Because the inn had a policy of paying after staying, the tea server did not press him. After staying one night, on the 28th, he was found lying in bed, not getting up. Due to the issue of the room fee, the tea server went to check on him and found him foaming at the mouth and unable to speak. The police were immediately notified, and Chen was taken to Jisheng Hospital on Baoshan Road. He was diagnosed with opium poisoning and, due to the depth of the poisoning, was beyond saving. He died on the afternoon of March 1st. A letter from his mother, his meal bills, and four pawn tickets, and eight business cards (belonging to friends) were found by his side. Yesterday, Yan Liugen, the local security officer from Jiyitu, reported the case to the District Court. Prosecutor Wang and others arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased was wearing a Yuanbu lambskin robe and had died from poisoning. The body was ordered to be collected and the letters and other items were filed. The contents of the original letter, the menu, and the details of the pawn tickets are recorded below, from which the cause of his suicide and his conduct can be readily understood. The original text is as follows: The envelope was addressed to "Chen Xiaocheng, to be delivered to Huizhong Inn, opposite the Hekang Sauce Garden on North Zhejiang Road, Shanghai, from Wuxi County Machine Drainage Industry Association." The letter read: "Zhirun, my son, I know you are working outside, and your mother knows everything. However, is the work you are doing proper? As a son, you must do good work in the world after the age of sixteen to be worthy of being a human being. You must think about it yourself. You said you have a wife, but I don't understand your previous letter. You also said that the money you brought out has been spent. This must be my son's fate. However, you must always try to walk on the right path. What does your wife's family do? Are her parents alive? You said you had one hundred and forty yuan. Where did this money come from? Was there anyone to witness your marriage? After receiving this letter, I hope you will tell me everything in detail. At home, your eldest brother will be starting a business within ten days, hoping to be home by June, but there is still no business. I have been living at home for several years. People are constantly coming to ask for the money you owe. How can I face people? Think about it. The items you pawned may be overdue. This year, I may not even survive the new year. You mentioned in your initial letter where you were staying. Do you know that your eldest brother has to bear a lot alone, spending dozens of yuan every month? There is no firewood or rice in the house, just like when you were little. Have you forgotten me? Your brother does not know about the letters you have sent. Today, I asked someone to write this letter for you. Quickly find a proper job to do outside, and I can be at ease. If you do not listen to me, do not ever see my face again in this life. Words cannot express everything. I am writing this letter to inquire about your well-being. I hope your health is good. Is your wife with you? Another note: January 28th, 20th year." The pawn tickets showed that three yuan were pawned on February 16th of this month, eight jiao on the 18th, seven jiao on the 19th, and five jiao on the 22nd. The menu showed that he had spent seventy-three jiao and two fen on food. He did not practice frugality and was in dire straits, leading to this outcome.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Li Xiujuan Sues Zhu Mintang for Divorce <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhu Mintang, Young and Debonair</p>
<p>▲ Took a Dancing Girl as a Concubine</p>
<p>▲ Treated His Wife as if She Were Nothing</p>
<p>▲ Accused of Abuse and Abandonment</p>
<p>Zhu Mintang from Zhenhai, young and debonair, was a comprador for Arnhold &amp; Co. last year. With ample finances, he danced every night and fell in love with Zhao Xiuzhen, a dancing girl at the Datong Dance Hall. When Zhao became pregnant, Zhu abandoned her, leading to her suing him for seduction at the Special District Court. After an initial hearing, a settlement was reached, and Zhao remained with Zhu as a concubine. She returned to Zhu's hometown with his parents. She gave birth to a son, whom Zhu doted on, treating his wife, Li Xiujuan, as if she were nothing. When his position as comprador was terminated, he ordered Li to return to their hometown, citing the high cost of living in Shanghai. Li proposed an exchange: after returning to their hometown, Zhu should sever his relationship with Zhao Xiuzhen, and Zhao's son should not inherit any of his assets in the future. Zhu could not accept Li's conditions, so she lived alone in Shanghai. However, Zhu never provided her with living expenses, and she faced great difficulties. Therefore, she retained lawyers Eson Ni and Ni Zheng'ou to file for divorce against Zhu in the Special District Court. The court session was held yesterday morning, but Zhu Mintang did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyers, the grounds for divorce, such as abuse and abandonment, were all based on the defendant's conduct in Shanghai. Therefore, they filed the lawsuit with the court, making the proceedings easier. The defendant should not evade the proceedings by failing to appear. Judge Yang instructed the plaintiff to postpone the hearing to a later date. Li attended the court with several girlfriends, but they did not know that the defendant would not appear, preventing them from confronting him. She was heavily pregnant and reportedly soon to give birth. If this "piece of flesh" were to be born after the divorce, wouldn't it be a fatherless child?</p>

<p>▲ Owner of Yuquanlou Teahouse</p>
<p>▲ Gao Shuanglin Still Denies Involvement</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Public Security Bureau recently apprehended a kidnapper named Wu Changgui. According to his confession, at the end of November of the lunar calendar last year, he colluded with others in the countryside of Yuyao County to kidnap a nine-year-old boy and hide him in the Yuquanlou Teahouse in the Qipu area of Shanghai. The owner of the teahouse, Gao Shuanglin, also known as Gao Xiaopijiang, was allegedly the leader of the kidnapping gang. Based on this information, the bureau requested the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to investigate. Chief Chen ordered detective Gao Wansheng to investigate and found that there was no place called Qipu in Shanghai, but there might be a misunderstanding with Qipu Road in the Public Concession. He went to Qipu Road to investigate and found the Yuquanlou Teahouse. He worked with Inspector Bai Zhongqi and Detective Bao Wang Qishan of the Huisi Police Station to arrest Gao Shuanglin, the owner of the Yuquanlou Teahouse from Yangzhou. However, the kidnapped boy was not found. Yesterday morning, Gao was taken to the Special District Court for investigation. Gao completely denied the charges and retained lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Ge postponed the hearing until the 9th of this month because the official document from Hangzhou had not yet arrived at the court.</p>

<p>▲ The Deceased Was Found Hanging from the Beam</p>
<p>▲ There Were No Tables or Stools Below</p>
<p>Tang Wenjia, a clerk at the Japanese-owned Fourth Cotton Mill and a native of Anhui, lived at 1795 Huade Road with his wife, Zhu. Zhu was 23 years old and also worked at the cotton mill. On the 28th of last month, Tang and Zhu went to work at the factory at 5 PM. At 6 PM, Zhu suddenly returned home and remained in the bedroom for a long time. Her younger sister-in-law and fourth child caught a glimpse of Zhu hanging herself in the room. They reported it to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. It was already 2 AM when the detectives arrived. They found the deceased still hanging from the beam, with no tables or stools below. The circumstances were suspicious. The body was taken to the coroner's office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Huaipu from the Special District Court inspected the body. He took his seat and heard from the deceased's husband, Tang Wenjia, who stated that his wife's suicide was possibly due to losing some clothing and requested a coffin for burial. Then, Zhu Liu, the deceased's aunt, claimed that the deceased was forced to death and asked for a thorough investigation. Guo informed her that if she had any evidence, she could file a lawsuit with the court. He then concluded that the deceased, Tang Zhu, had indeed died by suicide and released the body to her husband, Tang Wenjia, after he signed a statement.</p>

<p>▲ Remarks by Libanov</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the reporter recently met with Libanov, the China manager of the Soviet Union Oil Trust, who said that the trust had been studying the Chinese kerosene market for more than a year. In another five or six months, a large quantity of Russian oil could be sold in China. Currently, no Russian oil products have been shipped to Shanghai because their aim is to wholesale in large quantities, not to sell in small quantities. The reporter also learned from people in the oil industry that Libanov has been in contact with the Guanghua Company to act as their agent. It is unknown how far the negotiations have progressed. The trust aims to promote Russian oil products throughout China and wants to find one company to handle sales nationwide.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Issue of Collecting Seasonal Fees in West Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau is now preparing to collect seasonal fees from merchants and residents in the West Shanghai area. It has sent personnel to investigate household rents and has posted notices. It is understood that the businesses and residents on the roads built beyond the boundaries of West Shanghai were once approached by the Municipal Finance Bureau to collect seasonal fees some years ago. However, the collection was abandoned because the merchants and residents argued that they were already burdened by the land taxes collected by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). Now that the Municipal Finance Bureau is about to implement the collection again, the content and process of the SMC's collection of seasonal fees is attracting attention. The information gathered is summarized as follows: West of Haig Road, Di Feng Road, and Jiaozhou Road in West Shanghai is the Chinese territory where roads were built beyond the concession boundaries. Traditionally, residents along the roads and near the roads have used electricity, water, and telephones from the concession. The SMC initially collected a 12% seasonal fee from water and electricity users. In 1928, they began collecting seasonal fees from telephone users as well, and then uniformly increased the fee to 14%. However, those who did not use water, electricity, or telephones were not charged. In recent years, due to the needs of life, the number of water and electricity users has increased significantly, so the number of payers has also increased year by year. Even those who live further away from the road have been connected to electricity and are paying fees to the SMC. The receipts issued by the SMC state that the payments are made voluntarily. It is not clear how much the SMC collects in donations from outside West Shanghai, but it is observed that six or seven out of ten residents along Haig Road, Great Western Road, Di Feng Road, Connaught Road, Robison Road, Yu Yuan Road, Edina Road, Da Xi Road, Penang Road, Singapore Road, Brenan Road, and nearby roads pay seasonal fees to the concession. Furthermore, there are many foreign residents in the area, so the SMC collects a considerable amount of revenue from outside West Shanghai. Even as far away as Hongqiao Road, Sheshan Road, Beifang Road, and Robegen Road, there are a small number of residents who pay the fees.</p>

<p>▲ Sun Changgen, Who Was Wrongfully Accused, Has Been Exonerated</p>
<p>Li Dazaozi, the owner of the Tongxing Teahouse at 355 Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, was shot and killed by an adulterer on the night of July 19th last year. The murderer escaped, and only Sun Changgen was caught. The Shanghai District Court sentenced him to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder. Sun appealed, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, the murderer, Fei Deji, was finally found by the deceased's wife, Zhao, and his cousin, Li Decheng. They took him to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. During the preliminary interrogation, Fei Deji claimed to be a legitimate businessman and denied committing the murder. Zhao claimed that she had an affair with Sun Changgen before becoming involved with Fei Deji. Fei wanted to marry her as his fourth concubine, but she refused. Her parents arranged her marriage to Li Dazaozi. Sun and Fei harbored feelings in their hearts and shot her husband on the night of July 19th. She was working at the factory and fortunately escaped unharmed. Today, she and Li Decheng found Fei on Jiaotong Road and handed him over to the police. Li Decheng's statement was similar. The district chief verified the statements and transferred the three to the court for further investigation. According to another report, Sun Changgen, who was involved in the case, was acquitted by the Suzhou High Court after appealing and has been released from prison.</p>

<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>On the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, she was lured to the home of Chen Dehong, a bathhouse attendant who lived next door, under the pretense of playing mahjong. An hour later, after the game ended, Chen lured Maotou into the room. Chen's roommate, Li Shiquan, locked the door from the outside, and Chen forcibly raped her. Her mother found out and scolded Maotou. Unexpectedly, Chen then instigated Maotou to steal 500 yuan from her brother's rice store. On the third day of the same month, he sent Li Shiquan to escort her to the Sutai Hotel No. 24 in Suzhou to stay temporarily. When her brother discovered that the money was missing and his sister was gone, he knew that Chen Dehong must have been responsible. He reported it to the police, who arrested Chen. Chen confessed Maotou's whereabouts. On the fifth day of the same month, he, accompanied by police detectives, her brother Wu Shaotang, and Li Dean, who had once served as Chen Dehong's guarantor, went to Suzhou to find her. The police had previously brought a public prosecution in this case, sentencing Li Shiquan to one year and two months in prison. However, the 500 yuan that Wu Maotou stole has not been returned. Therefore, Wu Shaotang filed a private lawsuit yesterday, claiming that when his sister was apprehended, Wu Maotou had already used 50 yuan to have Chen Dehong make a leather robe. There were still 450 yuan hidden in the legs of two pairs of pants. Although the Suzhou Public Security Bureau searched, the money was not found. Later, when Chen, Wu, and others were about to be released, they settled the hotel expenses. While Wu Shaotang was away, Chen Dehong threatened Maotou, saying, "If you hand over the silver to Li Dean, otherwise, once you get to the Shanghai prison, it will definitely be searched and lost." Therefore, Maotou handed over all 450 yuan to Li Dean. During the previous court hearing, this was never mentioned or adjudicated, which was unsatisfactory. Therefore, he pleaded with Li Dean and others to hand over the money. Li Dean claimed that he had not received the money. Moreover, the detectives were present at the time, and the detectives who handled the case could be questioned. Chen Dehong not only denied receiving the silver but also denied having an affair with Wu Maotou. The judge presented the previous court testimony and evidence, and he had no choice but to admit it. Wu Maotou was then questioned. She confessed that it was true that she had been seduced and ran away by Chen Dehong. As for Li Shiquan being sentenced to one year and two months in prison last time, the three of them had colluded and agreed on the same story. They had said to me, "One person will go to court, there's no need for everyone to go together," etc. The 450 yuan was indeed handed over to Li Dean for safekeeping. At that time, Chen and others threatened her, and she was momentarily confused, resulting in this situation. She also pleaded for the return of the money. The court ordered Chen Dehong to be detained, and Li Dean was released on 500 yuan bail. Li Shiquan was still detained. The hearing was rescheduled for 2 PM on the afternoon of the 12th.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Date of Dismissal of Shop Assistants and Methods <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Two Types: Contractual and Customary</p>
<p>In response to the question of the date of dismissal of shop assistants, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai New-Style Laundry Trade Association, instructing on the methods. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, on the 28th of this month, we received your letter inquiring whether the settlement date can be combined with the date of partners joining and leaving. After investigation, there are two preliminary questions in this case: (1) Has the industry signed a labor-capital contract? (2) If the industry does not have a labor-capital contract, has the joining and leaving of partners always been on the three festivals or at the end of the year? This aspect is what is called custom. Your letter did not explain the above two points and the term 'custom' does not seem to be appropriate and is difficult to understand. As for the inquiry about whether the settlement date can be combined with the joining and leaving of partners, the current settlement dates are at the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December. The dates of shop assistants joining and leaving are in accordance with Instruction No. 265 of the Municipal Government issued to this association on August 5 of last year, which stated: 'Approved the consultation of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that the customs of shop assistants joining and leaving are different in various places and industries. After detailed research, it can be temporarily handled according to the old customs of various places and industries. However, since the settlement date of merchants has been officially ordered to be changed to the Gregorian calendar, the old time for shop assistants joining and leaving should also be changed to the Gregorian calendar.' This association presented this to the Social Affairs Bureau. Since shop assistants joining and leaving are handled according to old customs, if there are doubts about the period of joining and leaving at the time of the three festivals settlement, this time, according to the document of the Ministry, it can be changed to the end of May, the end of September, and January 5 of the year following the big conclusion at the end of December as the period for shop assistants joining and leaving. This refers to those who have not signed a labor-capital contract. Those who have signed a labor-capital contract, according to Instruction No. 2962 of the Social Affairs Bureau of last year, 'Contracts from the lunar calendar will be calculated according to the Gregorian calendar, delaying one month from the previous due date.' According to this standard, all labor-capital contracts that were previously set to be dismissed on the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the fifth day of the first lunar month must be changed to June 5, September 15, and February 5 of the Gregorian calendar before they can join and leave. This association has presented a request to amend the two methods because they are so different and inconvenient. However, the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau has not been received. According to the above situation, there are two methods for shop assistants joining and leaving: (1) Those who have not signed a labor-capital contract are handled according to custom, but the date is changed to the Gregorian calendar. (2) Those who have signed a labor-capital contract, if using the lunar calendar, are calculated according to the Gregorian calendar date of the due date, delaying one month. This letter is to inform the Shanghai New-Style Laundry Trade Association."</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>After reading your newspaper's Shanghai news column on March 1, which contained a section on the aftermath of the Gongfa Company's problems, my conversation was slightly different from the facts. I certainly had the idea of ​​soliciting people to lease the Great World and using the annual rental income to repay the creditors. As for other businesses of Gongfa Company, I was not clear about the content, such as the 50,000 yuan for the hot spring bath and the 300,000 yuan for the Chinese and Western pharmacies, etc. In the conversation at that time, it may have been a mistake to refer to the total rental price for several years. Corresponding letter, I hope to correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Min Caizhang</p>
<p>March 2nd,</p>
<p>Respectfully, after checking the land used for Beihui Road in our county at that time, the calculated land price was originally based on a width of 12 meters as the standard. Now the construction of the road only uses 9 meters or so. The remaining land on both sides is for future expansion. And in the Shanghai news column of your newspaper on March 2, there was a statement about our bureau setting up the boundary of Beihui Road, saying that the calculated land used for the road was originally based on a width of 9 meters as the standard, and now only 7 meters or so is used. The recorded number of feet is completely inconsistent with the facts. In order to provide accurate information, we would like to ask your newspaper to correct it quickly to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai County Construction Bureau</p>

He used to travel to Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping and Yokohama, all as head chefs. Therefore, he is indeed superior to others in food preparation and cooking, and many people in the industry also admire him. The owner of Qingyise is a close friend of Mr. Luo. He had once hired him before, but Mr. Luo's contract in Yokohama was not over and he could not come to Shanghai. Now, the owner, admiring Mr. Luo's skills, sent several telegrams inviting him.

Raw dyeing means that the silk is already colored before weaving, and cooked dyeing means dyeing after weaving. The former is more expensive. Kaixuan silk stockings are all raw dyed.</p>
