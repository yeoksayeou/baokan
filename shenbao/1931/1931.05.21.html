<p>時評</p>
<h3>英外相任軍縮大會主席</h3>
<p>此次歐聨委員會中德奥俄法各代表。對於歐洲經濟問題。均有咄咄逼人之演說。而英代表漢德森之演說。最爲懇切而穩健。一方動議以德奧税約付海牙審查。以調解德法之爭。一方對俄聲明無與蘇聨尋釁意。而併欲與之增進經濟上密切之關係。至對經濟問題。則主張推舉十七國代表組織小組委員會。審查所有挽救經濟危局之各議案。以備解决。蓋皆所以謀調和今日之爭也。現漢德森已被公舉爲明年國際軍縮大會主席漢氏旣深知各國軍備無謂之競爭。實爲造成經濟危局之重要原因。則將來擔任軍會主席。必能出其全力以遏止軍事上之糾紛。軍縮前途一線之希望。固將於此其之矣。然而觀於今日會内之空氣。税約問題。雖已允付法庭審查。而兩方尚多爭議。軍縮大會雖已推定主席。而對於軍備公開問題。各方尚多異議。且進觀各國内部之擴充軍備。正在急急進行。而所謂德意志一萬噸之怪軍艦。昨行下水禮時。德人奮興狂熱。大有以前一切失敗。將收回於此一艦之勢。各國對此。皆爲一震。路透且謂爲推翻世界軍縮專家之計度。嗚呼。軍縮云乎哉。</p>

<p>路透社二十日日内瓦電　國聨行政會今晨開秘密會議、决定以日内瓦爲明年軍縮大會開會地點、</p>
<p>國民社二十日日内瓦　今日國聨理事會議討論爭執最甚之各國軍備公開問題、德國動議要求受過訓練之後備兵與儲藏之軍需品、俱應列入按時送交國際聨盟之軍備單内英國計劃則主張採用軍縮委員會製備之指數表、其中對於德國要求之兩項、未曾提及、今日由英外相漢德森開始討論稱、德國計劃期在求準確上、固是標準辦法、可謂本問題理想的解决法、但其大弊在將引起無謂之爭論、吾人必須顧及實行方面、故請會衆對於軍縮委員會製備之表、應認爲满意、法外長白里安起稱、法國不能贊同德國計劃、願接受英國提議、而附加若干保留、嗣德外長演說力爭唯有列入後備兵與所儲軍實兩項後、始克將各國軍事實力作一可靠比較、最後會中以雙方主張各執、决定將此問題展期至星期五再行討論、</p>

<p>國民社十九日日内瓦電　英國所提出將德奥税約法律問題交付海牙國際法庭之建議、雖已經歐聨委員會中各國代表全體通過、而今日會議中仍有繼續之辯論、但并未發生何種重要影響、其中南斯拉夫外長對於德外長所宣言之德國立塲、頗爲非難之詞、而德外長寇蒂斯亦有相當之辯駁、由德外長白里安起而調停、阻止雙方之爭論、而英外相漢德森亦有懇摯之演說、（以下路透社電）謂歐洲現正在空前劇烈之經濟恐慌中、人民有失業飢寒之苦、而歐洲與海外諸國則榖溢倉外、莫能售出、億兆資金空儲銀行、又謂國際安全戰爭無慮之空氣、乃恢復經濟之第一必要條件、胡佛總統有言、明年軍縮成功、世界恐慌可减、旨哉此言、許多國家之輿情、現漸了解經濟國家主義所造成之無謂痛苦、而漸主張國聨機關下國際聨合行動之程序、今歐洲大部份亟待人供以金融、但有餘資之國、則未有假借之意、貿易之障碍、即爲興盛之障碍、英政府現最注重者、乃减輕税率問題、彼用種種方法以屏除外貨之國、適使自己與他人交困而已、債權國要求還債、但又不受其所可供獻之物品、而唯現金是索、於是金之需求大、而物價遂狂跌、其實國際貿易必須用交換形式也、渠尚望代表勿存國聨會員國現謀對俄開戰之念、國聨會員國所希望者、爲增進和平的往來耳、俄代表苟能以互守國際義務爲根據、有所襄贊、以助其希望之實現、固國聨會員國所歡迎也云、</p>
<p>國民社十九日柏林電　德奥税約雖有日内瓦之討論、與海牙之法律審查、德奥兩政府間仍將照常進行談判、以期完成關税聨盟、今日德政府宣稱、德國深信在兩國關税聨盟中、業已覔得一挽救經濟危局之方法、此種信仰、迄今仍未稍變、按德奥税約問題、自經國聨理事會議决交國際法庭審查後、德代表即聲稱、倘將來國際法庭認此舉無背現行條約、法政府仍認其足以危及歐局之安定、將請國聨理事會加以政治與經濟方面之研究、而英外相漢德森亦表示在海牙裁决以後、英國不反對法政府所認爲合理之行動、但德國則力爭國聨理事會祇能在法律方面加以審查、因此目下仍與奥政府進行談判、將業已成就之原則、擬定條約形式、現德法兩國見解之矛盾若是、逆料此舉將成爲今後歐洲政局上一大問題、雙方必出死力以相爭、行將曠日持久、非一時間所罷了結者也、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>美國著名之浦靈斯頓大學。Princeton　University曾作動物學上的試騐。他們從一頭鼈的身中。剜出一顆來。利用科學的方法。能使此心跳動至三十六小時之久。</p>
<p>海狗一出了水。眼光非常遲鈍。幾乎瞧不出東西來。因此歐美一般販賣海狗皮的人。往往等候它們上岸遊玩時。一鼓成擒。</p>
<p>英國盲人。向地方當局登記的。共有五萬零七百七十一人。内三萬六千四百八十五人。都没有職業。可知失明的人。找尋職業是極不容易的。</p>
<p>美國有一位美容專家說。婦女們倘能時時微笑。可使面容見得嬌嫩而年輕。要是常作冷顔向人的。下頷易於疊起。（即俗所謂二下巴）</p>

<h3>國民會議拾零</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>國民會議於五月五日雨絲風片中舉行開幕典禮。而於十七日青天白日下舉行閉幕典禮。誠如胡庶華先生所稱「國議正要下雨。這是總理在天之靈。詔示我們處此風雨飄摇之際。大家應要同舟共濟。…最後想起德人有一句成語。雨後早晴。通常勉勵人家。努力從艱難困苦中求一條光明正大之路。兄弟以爲國議後所有一切狂風暴雨。都成過去。而得眞正青天白日。謹以此意。祝國民會議成功」也。自開會至閉會。中凡十三日。愚以近在咫尺。時得瞻仰。茲記其瑣屑。以實本談。</p>
<p>此日首都　自國議開幕。首都市面。皆煥然一新。成賢街迤南一帶。牌樓相望於道。入晩五采電炬齊明。都人士春服初成。有萬人空巷之概。同時各報皆增印國民會議特刊。而首都大戲院。特於開幕日演放「國魂。」每次皆賣满座。此足證首都人十茲日鼓舞歡欣之一斑也。</p>
<p>展覽大觀　國内各種展覽會。於國議開幕前後交相舉行於首都。若江蘇特産展覽會。若革命史績展覽會。若衞生展覽會。若中大十七級藝術展覽會。若京市美術展覽會。若杭州美專展覽會。風起雲湧。有雨後春筍之觀。都人士日來眼福。誠匪淺也。</p>
<p>汽車大會　開幕閉幕之日。汽車蟻聚麕集。即以中大之寥廓廣場。亦幾如英雄無用武之地。每日開會。則上午八時與十二時。汽車一出一入。成賢街上。汽車銜尾奔馳。嘗一小時不絶。初於會塲索某號汽車。即由警士持號筒高呼。久而始得。其後以範圍太廣。聲浪不達。乃劃地爲區域。代表居某號宿舍。汽車即停於某號範圍内。此舉蓋爲警士造福不少云。</p>
<p>梧桐春愁　當廣闢中央大學大中路時。兩旁五六年來所植之法國梧桐。已幹如人腰。根被丈餘。乃用起重機外移。一樹每用數十人工作一小時始克竣事。聞每株移植費爲四元五角云。</p>
<p>會塲晩景　自成賢街入會塲。凡三松柏牌樓。皆高大莊嚴。尤以大門前之牌樓爲最。肖古樓形式。下開三孔。凡高十餘丈。飛簷疊舋。得中國古代建築之美。而爲意亦至深。每屆掌燈時候。則電炬爭暉。遊人遠瞻者至衆。大禮堂入晩尤輝煌。萬燈連簇。照澈遠林羣花之。上有春光如海之觀。其雄渾崔巍。偶行柱下。直類蟲豸蠕蠕。寂寥無人。崇敬之思。每油然衷懷矣。</p>

<h3>又說一夢</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>愚年弱冠。隨先君流寓湖南湘潭縣城内之學坪。學坪者。學宫前之空地也。直抵南城根。其門曰觀湘。湘潭商務素盛。街市以總稱。在城外。出觀湘門爲九總。沿流而上。乃至十八總。延長可二十里。而尤以十五六總爲菁華薈萃之區。光緒庚寅七月十二夜。愚得一夢。夢見十五六總失愼。紅光燭天。遥聞人聲喧嚷。其中又夾有一種聲。如聨珠爆竹然。醒而記之。湘俗早晨忌言夢。飯畢述之。先君曰。爾殆心想夢耳。蓋時屆中元。湘俗祀祖。家戶焚化冥鏹。胥於學坪。日數十百起。其光熊熊。感想爲夢。理論極似。越二日。十四薄暮。聞城外警鑼鏜鏜。急馳入城。俄而水龍馳往。文武輿馬傳呼繼之。晩飯旣畢。先君率愚兄弟輩登觀湘門城樓以觀。方登城瞭望。即觸記愚夢。失火恰在十五六總間。所見紅光燭天。所聞人聲喧囂中夾雜爆竹之聲。一一與夢境符合。爆竹聲者。後此知發自河街製篙之竹店也。先君亦詫奇夢。以謂非昨預說。鮮不疑兒爲妄者。凡夢易忘。此夢因此而記憶眞確。往往詢人。而莫得其解。國初在浙督秘書處。述諸同事丁桂樵。桂樵好佛。舉示狄楚青君所著平等閣筆記。中有一則。主人蓄一鵝。夜夢其鵝爲犬撲殺。明日犬果撲殺鵝。解釋大旨。凡未來事胥具在人之八識田中。偶現於夢耳愚鈍根人。殊未了解。且其鵝其犬。皆家畜。於主人皆有因緣。若愚則梗泛萍飄。於湘潭了無關係。該邑大縣。人口不下百萬。而朕兆獨現於絶無關係之一少年。斯何故歟。如丁狄佛家言。是世間小如鵝斃。大如火災。中間萬事。皆有一定。然則纖緯定數。果有之耶。猶愚自身言。功名奔走數十年。未來之吉凶禍福亦多矣。應具藏八識。何以絶不見夢。而轉夢毫無關係之火災耶。誠望丁狄兩君爲愚進一解。並望哲學靈子學家有以敎我也。</p>
<p>短訊　巴黎大戲院。於本星期四起開映一社會警世鉅片。曰「竊玉偷香」。不但情節表演。並皆美妙。而其劇旨對於現代社會。尤能對症下藥。發人深省。蓋現代青年男女。每將精神之愛與性慾之愛。混而爲一。於是種種慘劇。因之産生。即本片之主人翁。亦因未能認清此點。致女珠胎暗結。一時飛短流長。人言嘖嘖。事聞於女父。屢欲置女於死地。幸男子情堅如鐵。卒成眷屬。然女已憔悴不堪矣。且中有一段穿揷。尤爲警惕。緣是時另有同居男子某甲。乃一竊玉偷香之能手。平時亦頗垂涎女色。當女之秘密洩漏後。人多疑女子對手。必係某甲。於是以訛傳訛。事聞於某甲之情人。一時悲憤交加。竟致越窗自殺。世界上好談人是非之長舌婦。觀此將不知作何感想也。（聲普）</p>

<h3>黄海環遊記（九）</h3>
<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>四月二日晨赴朝鮮即晩抵京城。</p>
<p>朝鮮第三度來遊了。鮮友日友還不少。三年前曾著「朝鮮」一書。當局知我注意鮮事。由總督府外事課導觀敎育文化各機關。並宴我於明月樓。清歌曼舞中。自然而然地發生不少哀感。</p>
<p>明月樓即席題壁</p>
<p>漢城三月春如沐。樓頭故事猶堪哭。一電當年壯士名。五雲今夜佳人服。卿起舞。我作歌。歌成月色一天白。照澈漢江來去波。（一九一九年朝鮮獨立宣言。諸志士集明月樓。邏者急。以電話自報姓名於警察署。皆被捕。）</p>
<p>一妓名珊瑚珠。强我題詩。爲寫一絶。</p>
<p>紅是珊瑚白是珠。佳人相對意何如。倘逢海外虬髯客。識得英雄遇不孤。</p>
<p>日本對朝鮮的政策。從一九一九年以來。撤廢日鮮一切不平等待遇。迄今猶在施行此政策中。此是那年兩個炸彈的效力。可是日鮮平等。限於表面。骨子裏施行兩大政策。（一）移民。前已說過。鮮民二百萬移入南满。爲取得商租權的先鋒。（二）同化。極意提倡日鮮通婚。政府對通婚者每夫婦奬以百金。但全鮮一千九百萬人民中僅得四百五十餘對夫婦耳。余問鮮人願與日本人做夫婦麽。答男誰願要日本人。女誰肯嫁日本人。</p>
<p>日本極意懷柔朝鮮人民。並挑撥朝鮮人民使仇視吾國人。他們用心的陰險。讀田中奏本朝鮮移民奬勵及保護政策一章早赤裸裸地說出了。他說「在满蒙之朝鮮人如至二百五十萬人以上。待有事之秋。以朝鮮民爲原子。而作軍事活動。然我國可利用鮮人。不可不防支那政府利用鮮人以制我。」爲這個緣故。他們盡力離間鮮人對我的情感。</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（二○）</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>那天午後。霍桑所說的有事。我並不參與。他祗說有幾條線路必須急急進行。但因着我的佩芹還未健全。不讓我同去。祇呌我回家去等候消息。到了這天的黄昏。霍桑來了一個電話。告訴我他對於那少年的下落已有七八分把握。料想不久就可以完全查明。我暗忖七八分的把握。距離完全的結果。已相差無幾。不能不算是可喜的消息。至於霍桑究竟用什麽方法得到七八分的成績。我除了驚異和佩服以下。再没有别的意念。我又耐着性兒等了一天。到了第二天午後三四點鐘。霍桑忽親自到我寓所裏來。他聲言是來探望我佩芹的病的。實際上他却帶三種驚喜的消息給我。不過這消息他不即宣布。直到他告辭出去。我送到門外。他才悄悄向我說明。他低聲道。「你那晩上的經歷。諒來也瞒你夫人的罷。」我點了點頭。霍桑微笑着道。「我幸虧知趣。不曾當面說破。」我道。［但這個人的蹤跡。你不是已完全探明了麽。」霍桑似乎模彷我的舉動。照樣點一點頭。我急忙道。「這人是誰。他是怎樣一個人物。」霍桑道。「這個人來頭很大。姓車名呌時傑。住在大統路七一八號。從前在軍界裏當過小差事。故而和高佩賢相識。現在却在温律師那裏當一名書記。那温律師還是他的表叔。」我道。「這人當一個律師的書記。也不能說怎樣了不得啊。」霍桑道。「這温律師單名一個章字。你可也聞名過麽。」我才知這人專辦那些姦盜的案子。在社會上很有些「歪譽」。確不是一個好惹的人物。我還没有答話。霍桑繼續道。「這個人是靠法律喫飯的。這一回事他旣轉了一個灣。用間接的手段作弄我們。不留什麽跡象。在法律上他實在没有處分可言。所以我們的報復方法。也不能不想一個轉灣方法。」我又急急問道。「那麽。怎樣轉灣。你已胸有成竹麽。」霍桑摇頭道。「還没有。這個祇能耐着性等候時機。急切從事。反而要壞事的。」</p>

<h3>銀洋市趨向殊途</h3>

<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市厘價因外界收買、結果加昻半厘、爲七錢二分九厘二毫半、午市同價、至於今日是否有續漲情形、則現在爲亂離市面、殊難斷定「銀拆」早午市同爲三分、較前日改小二分、劃頭加水則有二三分行市、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市有進展之勢</h3>

<h3>糧食　客秈銷活價漲角許</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、仍因被本街爭辦、市氣甚佳、形情亦跳漲角外、蓋目下存底本少、一經本街競辦、貨主尤爲居奇、今後如本街胃口仍濃、則到乏存枯、行情尚須步好也、昨日統市開出江西機晩一千五百包、價十一元四角至十一元一角、較前日漲角許、又新到蕪湖機秈三百包價十元零八角至十元零三角、其他貨乏未開、</p>
<h3>期洋米步步上漲</h3>
<p>新成交千五百噸</p>
<p>邇日洋米市面、頗見熱閙、滬商各洋行方面、續有電報打出、行情則因滬市杜客米一致上騰後、乃爲跟好、且金價高昻、合價亦貴、昨日三井洋行售邮六月份敏當米五百噸、價五兩五錢半、比前開漲一錢半、又一號西貢一千噸、係七月期、價五兩七錢半、則合划較漲有二錢以上矣、</p>
<h3>期麥幾番變動</h3>
<p>結果跌度無多</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈激昻之態、以洋麥之報價、旣回高二三角、天時又依然陰雨不已、四週環境、愈形惡劣、故開價後、以人心之狂熱、市面又見暴跳、本月份最高至四兩三錢六月份至二錢半、七月份至二錢二分、八月份至二錢三分、九月份至二錢四分、十月份至二錢八分、較前日收價、又暴漲四五六七分不等、迨至下午開盤、以天有晴意、又傳廠家定成洋麥三萬噸、洋商之兜售者仍然活絡、人心至此、已經虚軟、一般浮多、更從事回出、故市面亦曾暴跌、惟較前日收價、跌則無幾、結果本月份較小七分、六七月份小二分、八九月份小一分、十月份小三分云、</p>
<h3>粉市進退俱速</h3>
<p>最後的跌數些微</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、仍呈俏利之象、以天時陰雨未已、洋麥報價又較好、投機浮多、活動甚力、五六七月份均衝出一錢關口、平均比較計漲一二分不等惟實銷客帮、未爲所動、反見回出、故漲勢未烈也、迨至下午開盤、以天時關係、人心已懈、又兼麥市回跌甚慘、多頭亦見之心虚、各月份之賣氣、亦盛極一時、惟連日漲度甚速、轉覺跌度之無幾也、結果本月份未動、六七月份小五釐八月份小二釐半、九月份未動、十月份小五釐云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　長安新繭高貨激漲</h3>
<p>繭産大磏繭質又劣優繭價開五十元零</p>
<p>長安附近各市鄉、今歲早帮蠶均失事、晩帮亦因天寒雨多、在大眠旺葉期中、備受損害、新繭收成統扯祗有二分年歲、而繭質次劣、市上優繭到貨寥寥、繭行祗開七八家、收貨有限、各行對於優繭放價競收、昨市改良種繭開五十元二角半云、</p>
<h3>滬廠經價難上漲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無起色、查匯市頻縮、海外廠經電轉價雖稍漲、奈扯合匯價仍難上漲、廠方售意益淡、昨祗三井進滬白廠經十包、乾利進川黄廠經二十包、高培進黄粗絲八包價仍不高云、</p>
<h3>婺南新茶開秤有待</h3>
<p>婺邑南鄉新茶、每年均較他處採製見早、因山戶多務農、此時均忙於種稻、期屆立夏前、咸提先擷做、上年南鄉茶葉、因北鄉山價抬高、茶號均捨近圖遠、同趨南路搜辦、故上年該鄉各村新茶、脱沽甚速、得價亦高、今歲山戶雖早採畢待沽、而號客以南路茶質較次、北鄉茶價、不致如上年之高昻、不欲趕即進辦、意均俟北鄉新茶出盤如何、再行開秤云、</p>
<h3>紅綠茶一致趨跌</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、祁門浮梁等路之紅茶、英德莊進意濃厚、全市成交二千一百二十五箱、交易不寂、惟中低紅茶、行家認價較苛、市盤跌落三四十兩、土莊珍眉綠茶、日來華商鑒於來路莊茶、即將到滬、深恐市面難於立住、亦不惜讓價求售、見跌一二十兩趨勢均不甚佳云、</p>
<h3>上玉新茶已開秤</h3>
<p>贛屬玉山·上饒等處新茶各山戶已早採畢收園、頭茶出産尚佳、因常玉一帶匪氛漸息、農民可安心採茶、兩邑頭茶收成、較之上年見增、本外埠店莊茶販、已有出秤收買、河口·上饒·玉城·橦村街·洋莊茶號、亦有少數動辦、近日玉茶開秤、每担自三十至二十四五元、但質屬低莊、他處茶號、因滬市低貨滯銷、鮮入過問、茶市前途、似無若何進展、山價亦勢難抬高云、</p>
<h3>糖市日糖續開二萬五千包</h3>
<p>本廠冰步漲二錢</p>

<h3>疋頭　直貢呢存底稀薄</h3>
<p>疋頭交易、因連朝陰雨、實銷大受影響、昨日雖金市暴漲、人心仍難振奮、實以時屆淡令之故、惟跌風已息、行家態度頗堅、開價均貴、本客俱無胃口、難以售開加以手貨尚多、上漲者寥寥無幾、昨直貢呢以存底漸稀較挺、獵雁三錢六分、莫干山三錢五分半、漂布平定、五千六百號金山寺十二兩六錢半、郭子儀十二兩八錢、福壽三星十一兩一錢、花鳥現貨缺乏、印花蔴紗梢軟、秃白三馬頭本街昨略有成交、售開二錢三分、藍條色汀連日因到貨充斥、跌去有、厘半、軍農圖·楊貴妃一致二錢二分半、元羽綢零星去路尚不寂清官鏡爲十一兩七錢半、竹林十一兩六錢半、三潭十一兩四錢半云、</p>

<h3>最近的加拿大文壇</h3>
<p>— 曼</p>
<p>加拿大在文學上的民族色彩是日漸其濃厚了、近來尤其顯著、這種現象可以說一半是受的路丹列色敎授（ProfessorV.B.Rhodenizer）底剌激、路丹列色底新者「加拿大文學要略」（A.Handbookon　Canadian　Literature）、是這方面的第一部概括流暢簡明公正的論著、他有勇氣地特别注重現代的作品、以爲小說上的優越地位是應當屬於那沉鬱而不靜默的瑞典人、菲力特列·格洛夫（Grederick　Philip　Grove）的、至於那個著名的女作家特拉羅虚（Mazo　de　la　Roche）、則他頗爲看不起、因爲她浮淺而缺少「寫實主義、」就全書而論、這確是一部有價值的作品、祇有他地重視悲劇的天才而輕蔑喜劇的天才的見解、是全書底唯一的缺點、</p>
<p>特拉羅虚女士底新作「狗的畫像」（The　Potrail　of　aDog）是一部描寫她的愛犬的動人的傳記、這是一本寫得很優美的書、讀過的人無不喜歡、但也有人覺得可惜、以爲她應當繼續寫她那一套的「雅爾那」說部（Jalna　Series）、不必中途改舄别的作品、這一套說部現在已寫完第三部了、今年秋季可以出版、全書大約是四卷吧、完成之後、當然是要成爲現代加拿大底一部文學巨著的、</p>
<p>菲力特列、格洛芙</p>
<p>底新著「生活底覊絆」（The　Yoke　of　Life）、却是和特拉羅虚相反、正是他的最重大最優越的一部作品、換句話說、正是他的傑作、這是一部很有力的小說、在構造上、遠過於他那部自傳性質的「搜索美洲」（A　Search　forAmerica）在闊·厚·精微·和辭章上是超過他的「澤地居留者」（Settlers　of　the　Marsh）的、因爲題旨是相同的緣故、我們如果要拿他這部小說和别的作品比較、那末只有哈代底「裘特」（Jude　the　Obscure）、然而格洛芙底這部小說並不是模倣哈代的、因爲他寫這部小說的時候、哈代底作品他連一行都没有看過哩、</p>
<p>在現代加拿大文壇裏有一個奇怪的人物、這人是從側路走到了加拿大文壇底中心的、他是加拿大的法國移民、但現在也被認爲法蘭西文壇底新人物之一、這人便是前年曾經得過法國龔果爾文學奬（Goncourt　prix）的</p>
<p>莫列司、康司丹丁、惠葉</p>
<p>（Maurice　Constantin　Weyer）惠葉在加拿大底曼列托巴州當過十二年的農夫、到了一九一四年、他却抛棄一切、回到祖國去從軍了、戰後他仍然回到加拿大、但是他自己的農塲已經荒蕪頽敗、不堪收拾了、於是他趕快跑到巴黎去、到巴黎去做了一個著作家、自從他的處女作「一個人思索他的過去」（AMan　Scans　his　Past）獲得了龔果爾奬之後、他的文學事業就開始了、這部小說正是壟果爾傳統之下的作品、除了一個簡單的情節、和一種生硬的背景之外、什麽都没有、背景是加拿大、但這加拿大只是法國人眼裏所看出來的加拿大、而且通篇充斥着法國人喜歡抽象的熱情、</p>
<p>這驚人的作家今年却寫了一部完全兩樣的作品「烈士之愚行」（AMartyr'sFolly）之純然是鄉土的正如他的處女作之純然是外國的、這部書是小說體裁的傳記、寫的是路易·李爾（Louis　Riel）底故事、路易李爾在一七七三年和一八八五的加拿大西北之亂、是叛亂者底領袖、作者用了這人的眞率描寫這急公好義而可辦事雜亂的青年、如何因爲他族人底庸弱無能而成爲奮鬥的羣衆底領袖、爭鬥底起因是、「赫貞江公司」將那在今日是西加拿大的地皮賣給了殖民地政府、然而對於當地居留民底權利却毫不顧及、因此這些居留民們都抗爭起來、西路易李爾成爲他們的領袖、他並不是一個能幹的人、但他終於爲他的民衆爭到了若干優待、爲他們的羅馬敎會爭到了全部的權利、可是在叛亂之中受難的英國新敎徒却要求要緝凶嚴辦、這時候李爾底朋友就離棄了李爾隨他去被捕而受了絞刑、他的罪名是犯了「政·法·敎·暗殺陰謀」之罪、</p>
<p>戰爭小說在近今的加拿大文壇還是很流行的、在幾部第一流的戰爭小說之中、喬治局盧（George　A.Drew）底</p>
<p>「加拿大底飛行戰士」</p>
<p>（Canada's　Fighting　Airmen）是最爲宏壯的、但是對於本國人未免有讚揚過甚的地方、這部書包含十篇故事、寫的是歐戰中加拿大十大飛行勇士底功績、在一九一四年的八月、歐戰爆發之時、不列顚底可以作戰的飛機還不到一百架、但是到了休戰的時候、所用的飛機計有二萬二千餘架、所用的人員計有三萬名、而其中的三分之一都是加拿大人、據官家的統計、飛行將校毁滅敵機之成績、加拿大畢孝泊與高列蕭兩人均在英國任何飛行將校之上、這兩人和巴克及麥克拉倫是世界十大飛行戰士之中的四個加拿大人</p>
<p>時事的問題近來是非常引起加拿大著作家們底注意、尤其是國外貿易問題、著名的</p>
<h3>加拿大諷刺作家</h3>
<p>斯丹芬李考克（Stephen　Leacock）一向是以他那獨特的滑稽諷剌文章著名的、但却出人意料之外地是一位大學的經濟學敎授、近來他發表了一部「不列顚帝國之經濟的昌盛」（Ecomic　Prsperity　inthe　Brtish　Empire）、主張爲了英國的製造家起見、自治的加拿大應仍改爲殖民地、直受倫敦轄制、而且應當每年吸收二百萬名的英國移民、以便解决英國人口過剩的困難、這眞是駭人聽聞的辦法、但據說李考克本是一個滑稽家、所以他這部經濟專書亦只好是當作滑稽小說看的了、雖然這部畫大有享受英國勳章的價值、</p>
<h3>看了晨光第五屆藝展以後的感想</h3>
<p>— 郭蠡</p>
<p>在未說出我的感想以前、我先聲明一句、對於繪畫我是個外行、所以我的言語有不妥適的地方、繪畫的同志們、請勿見笑、</p>
<p>這天是五一節、所以有了工夫能與諸大作見面實在很高興、當我到了晨光展會、上了樓之後一抬頭就看見了抱一先生的「木炭素描」再向前面一走、把我嚇了一下、原來是華復先生的「赤色的恐怖」和應鵬先生的「射」和「后羿射日」又同時看是「長沙印象」、這些作品都使我的靈魂振動起來了、欽佩作者們的偉大性、用他們的筆描出了人生一幕、把牠具體地活現在我們的眼前、作者以自自己生活的體騐出來的熱情的結晶、使我們只有靈肉皆感了、的確、畫到了這地步纔充分地表現了作者偉大的人格、並且、在這時候我還想起了元慶兄的一句話「一張得意的作品、眞是作者的一口鮮血的結晶、」如此這樣多的得意作品、全是鮮血的構成、尤其是對於晨光會的同志們在這困難之中、更加可欽佩了、</p>
<p>至於其中的許多作品、都很好、抱一先生的作品、到底是老手、構圖上、色彩上、筆觸上、都表現了陳先生的力量、尤其是那張「面顔Sketch」眞是具有特别的作風、色彩更是非凡的了、還有應鵬先生的「射」在我的不通的見解上看、他的作風在中國是很少見、色彩强烈、給人以一種非常之激剌、而我又覺得有點近乎弗郎期馮思篤克（Franz　Yon　Stuck）的作品中的風格、那個馬射是多麽的有着美與力的表現、不單如此、也有如日人高間氏所謂智的藝術而産出了、也許這些還不足形容、</p>
<p>此外、如像「夜之顫動」、「野玫玫」、「羣衆」、「賣花、「災民」等以及「桃花」「江灣路」、「落葉」、「續海之港」、「裏西湖」等、在各作品中不難的可以看出各有各的技巧、設色、構圖、筆法、顯出不同的特有的格調、總之這次的展覽至少使我得到了很好的知識感想印象、不過我還希望在第六屆展覽會中能看見幾張關於圖案的作品、也許這次是不方便或因他故、而没有展覽、我主觀地至少是如此的渴望着、並且渴望着各位先生打破現在中國藝術界的沉悶、</p>
<p>總之、還有其他好的作品、不勝枚舉、同時覺得自已的廢話也當收塲了、否則就會愈說愈閙成笑話了、</p>

<h3>北行散紀</h3>
<p>— 安年</p>
<p>十四　燕京拾碎（中）</p>
<p>女生宿舍的房子是完全朝南起的、你自然可以想見、當太陽從窗子外面透進了房的時候、房子裏是多亮、多和暖、女生宿舍男生是不能進去的、男女談天的地方、便是姊妹樓、（Sister　Hall）、姊妹樓一共兩座、因爲在外表上和在裏面的佈置都是一樣的、故以「姊妹」名、姊妹樓裏面是很考究的、描金的天花板、就像皇宫裏的房子一樣、祗是裏面是通暢的一間、並不是Box式的佈置、這在談「情」志來、的確不是很窩心的地方、聽說燕京的週刊上也曾有一個時期討論到這事、人是天生妒忌的、没有Pair的人、倒底佔多數、所以提議在Sister　Hall裏隔成若干BoX的意見、終於被駁斥了、</p>
<p>女生的體育館非常大、現在燕京男生的體育館還未全部完工、男體育館就是照了女體育館的樣子起的、我去參觀的時候、裏面的女指導員還出來招待、很爲客氣、</p>
<p>男生宿舍、大體上都是朝西朝東的、當中一條弄、兩旁房間、祗有第六宿舍才像女宿舍一樣、單排房間、一列朝南、在第六宿舍的面前、有一個湖、這湖、成爲燕大的很好的校景、冬天、湖結了冰、便成爲溜冰場、夏天、四週垂着柳絲、便有許多小艇在水上波動、燕京還有一個水塔也很美、本來是一個單調的自來水塔、因爲想將他點綴得很好看些、所以化了錢、又重興改飾了一下、塔影映在湖上裏、非常秀麗動人、</p>
<p>燕京的病院、也很舒服、有許多人因爲想到病院裏享去福幾天、所以時常愛裝病、自然裝病的也不一定准搬進病院去、但病院的舒適之引人、於此也可想見了、病院起在一座小山的後面、還有日光浴臺、</p>
<p>燕京每一座房子都有一間電話間、許多敎授的屋子裏、都裝有電話的、這些電話、自然是指校内分機而言、比如你想去看那一個敎授、你可先打個電話去通知一聲、或者想呌那一個同學來談天、你也可打一個電話去呌他、除此之外、燕京還有校内信箱、另外有一種校内郵票、所以在交通方面、也是非常便當的、</p>
<p>燕京的敎授們、大概是每一個人一座房子、除了燕京本身之内、附近、大都是敎員的住宅區域、有所謂燕東園、燕南園、佟府、等等、還有許多大花園、如達園等、均住着燕京的敎職員、燕京的敎職員、一共有二百八十餘人、單敎授們的住宅、有一百餘座、這些房子、都是由學校供給的、</p>
<p>燕京的圖書館自然不及清華、裏面書也不及清華多、但是在中文方面、却在國内要算第一、因爲美國哥倫比亞大學及哈佛大學有一個中國文化研究會的圖書部、附設在燕京的圖書館裏、他們盡有許多錢來搜買那些名貴的書、</p>
<p>假如没有到燕京去、你一定想、在燕京讀書、買書費用、得較普通學校大、（因爲他們許多書是原本的、）但事實上、却是相反、在燕京讀四年、還不曾買過十本書、是常事、在一二年級的時候、也許還有幾本基本書要買、而到三四年級的時候、簡直不消買一本書了、其原因並非所有的課完全是要Take　Notes、拆穿了談、因爲所有的一切TextBook、都由學校方面供給的、燕京每一個Term所開的課程非常多、因爲所開課程多、學生被分開、每一課程的選讀者、人數便減少、所以普通每一課程、祗有十個左右上課、而每一課程所用之書、圖書館全有、同一課本、圖書館總有七八本、選這個課程的人祇有十個左右、那末圖書館有七八本這一種書、不是也夠支配了嗎、</p>
<p>這種書是不可以借出來、所以、你要預備功課、你便非上圖館去不可、</p>

<h3>交大女生成立田徑賽隊</h3>
<p>— 荃</p>
<p>自去歲孫桂雲女士顯露頭角於全國運動會、全國女生咸知運動之重要、不肯後人、積極起而從事運動、交大女生、近有標語、曰「孫桂雲亦人也、我亦人也、桂雲能破百米紀錄、我不能耶、杭州有桂雲橋、安知今年南京全運會後、不能將我之名名南京之橋耶、是在人之自爲之耳」</p>
<p>交大女生旣抱此宏願、是以對於田賽、格外努力、在女生宿舍前有花園一座、四週跑道、原不甚直、現由女生要求體育當局、着工務處即日修直、劃出百米綫二百米線及四百米線、</p>
<p>每日清晨、恒見三位女士馳驅園中、一即李璇女士、身材短小、步履甚大、惜不能持久、五十米百米、自是能手、一即吳世英女士女士、籍廣東、前在廣東第一女子中學肄業、時百米成績、曾以十五秒獲第一、現因長久未練、初試身手之時、成績减色、一即侯毓芬女士、女士短跑甚佳、起步姿勢優美、百米成績約十四秒餘、三位女士、現均請該校畢業生海上著名足球家兼短跑家陳虞添君指導、陳君每星期到校三次、對於起步方法、脚步大小、及一切姿勢、均盡敎授、並訂有課本、以爲文字上之敎授、</p>
<p>經賽方面、除短跑外、尚有低欄一項、亦正在籌備績習加入、練習者有陶蒓女士、吳澍女士、惟尚未正式開始、</p>
<p>田賽方面有鐵球跳遠跳高三項、鐵球爲吳世英侯毓芬女士之拿手好戲、隨便擲來、均有八九米之成績、跳遠一項、指導者仍爲陳虞添君、加入練習者、有李璇女士、朱耀貞女士、文傑女士、跳高一項、成績雖不高、但練習者甚衆、有王亨齡朱耀珍文傑吳澍陶蒓等七八人、</p>
<p>總計田徑賽隊員共計十二人、現已組織成軍、推舉侯敏芬女士爲隊長、吳世英女士爲管理、外加男同學王某爲幹事、本屆江大運動會、該校女生以成軍伊始、除侯女士吳女士之短跑及侯女士之鐵球外、餘均無甚把握、故僅派侯吳二女士代表、在第一日預選中、均中選、决賽雖僅得一分、然以之比於光華等之吃鴨蛋、似覺猶有榮焉、聞該隊幹事言、該隊隊長頃發表規約三條、（一）不得無故不到練習、（二）不得在練習時作嬉笑遊戲狀、（三）不得違抗指導員之指導、如有違背、第一次警告、第二次嚴重警告、第三次報告體育當局警告、第四次由體育當局扣除體育學分一學分以示懲戒云、</p>
<h3>紛擾的一課</h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>「荻、這課是甚麽」維瞧着方收到的信、急急的說着、</p>
<p>「咦、你怎的不知道、這課就是你們所說的「隨意課」呵、現在、你莫非又要寫情書了嗎、」荻露着羡慕又像譏笑的臉色、望着維微笑的臉、</p>
<p>「是寫、自然寫情書、你爲甚麽也不抽些時間、寫給你的情人若呢、你知道、他的望眼欲穿了呢」、維在桌子裏拿出藍墨水、鋼筆和信紙、得意洋洋的說、</p>
<p>「有甚麽望眼欲穿不穿、我始終不願像你那樣做的、丢開了書本、把全神貫注在寫情書上的、我眞實的告訴你、我雖也歡喜談戀愛、有情人、但决不高興丢了任何那科功課、寫半個給情人的字的、我以爲我們現在旣是學生、應該把求學的念頭、放在一切之上……」</p>
<p>「好了、好了、荻女士、請住了口吧、我已領會你的「主義」了、我記得你不知宣傳過幾次了、」維望着獲莊嚴的背形、</p>
<p>「都不要聲響了、等會老先生進來上課、被聽見了、好意思的嗎、」這是北平的洪女士的口音、她很用心的在閲一本「前鋒月刊、」大概被他們你一聲、我一聲的鬧不清了、所以她突然的出來禁止她們、</p>
<p>「有甚麽不好意思、你看他自已……」維正要起勁的說下去、克先生的頭、已先伸進課室門了、她望見了他、把頭一縮、肩一聳、連忙低着頭、假裝着她本來在寫信、</p>
<p>「革……」克先生把他的皮鞋跟、很響的敲上講台、點了名、翻開書上課了、他先在黑板上畫了幾隻連在一起的三角、於是慢吞吞的打着英語敎我們了、「甚麽因爲這隻角是直角、故那隻角就怎樣、又那一隻又怎樣……」幾個幾何考得一百分和九十多的好學生、和着他、也很高興的說、有幾個考得没有像他們般優良的、冷冷的喊着、「不懂的、不懂的、請再講一遍、講得清楚些、」於是克先生定晴的、不可思議的望着喊的同學幾眼、重復這隻角、那隻角的敎了、</p>
<p>忽然琴女士拖長的喉嚨、曼聲的說、「這種幾何眞弄不清的了、好容易把他的理解明白了、過幾天仍全副的還了給你、我們讀他有甚用呢、况且研究這種幾何、最煩悶不過的了、」她平時上幾何課、如果給情人的覆信已寫好、她就糊亂的聽</p>
<p>先生講一會、不然、她也和維一樣的、願意犧牲了功課、一心一意的去寫情書、</p>
<p>「琴、你說得不對、研究幾何眞有趣呵、你覺得他煩悶、你應該怪你自已不是、平時在這課、你不去常常寫……你不是以爲他無用、不屑去研究他嗎、」影覺得說出情書兩字很不好意思、所以連忙把語意改變了、她是克先生最寵的一個、每次考試、第一個交卷、而成績又是最好的、</p>
<p>「你把你的心給了Lover、對於幾何、自然要覺無味、」這是另一個幾何大王的訓話、她說到Lover一字、聲音特别的低微、並且對克先生瞧了一眼、</p>
<p>「不要假惺惺、克先生、你看很多的同學在寫情書、你怎的管都不管、」荻把黑板上的幾何證明抄完了、聽他們吵得太鬧、就不平的告訴了先生、她或者在想、「幾個撒爛汚的同學、很快樂甜蜜的在寫情書、自已也來寫、又不願意丢了、假使聽先生講、又被他們吵得不靜心、」</p>
<p>「好了、大家靜些、聽我來說、有幾位在寫信的、我是知道的、我不禁止他們、第一、原希望他們自己覺悟的、第二、所謂青年人的「情」最易感動、最富、最熱烈的、若我不識相的禁止了他們、他們就不得不的停了筆、但若他們的心仍不停、或竟燃燒得更熱烈些、我所敎的、她的耳朶一進不進、那末、我亦何苦强迫他們枯坐一小時呢、所以、我的主張祗有聽其自然、要聽我的聽、不要聽我的不聽、一切都隨你們的便、反正性不近的人、學一輩子也學不精明、」</p>
<p>「但是、不對、克先生、你怎知道一個人的性近不近呢、」北平的洪女士、似反駁、又似懷疑的問着、</p>
<p>「那很簡單、性近的人、自會丢了一切、聽我講的、」他在抹去黑板上的字、打算敎下去了、</p>
<p>維忽然想着了甚麽似的、急促的說、「克先生、你說青年人的「情」最易感動、最熱烈的、那末、我問你、你的「情」怎樣、「維嬉皮的望着克先生發光的臉、</p>
<p>「不要吵、我要敎下一節了、那是要攷的、牠很重要、」克先生很快的連說了幾個「要」字、對於維的問話、也算回答了</p>
<p>「留在下次敎吧、今天你敎的那節、已足夠使我們的腦鬧昏了、」</p>
<p>「克先生、時候祗餘十分鐘了、給我們休息吧、」</p>
<p>「敎太多了、要像多吃了食物樣的、不及消化的、」</p>
<p>「………………………………」</p>
<p>紛紛擾擾的、好像先生所說我們的像「茶館店」、</p>
<p>「那末、你們要不敎就不敎、反正先生是學生的僕人、一切都聽命的、」</p>
<p>「唷、不、我們恐怕敎得多了、反要使我們已明白的、混糊塗了、」洪和許多同學都這樣的說着、</p>
<p>「總之你們對於情書讀不倦、寫不厭、願意拿「情」來蠱惑你自己、束縛你自已、而對於幾何、或其他别的學課、不願意像你們對於情書樣的、專心的做去、」</p>
<p>「克先生、你好似也給「情」蠱惑了、你的書提夾中、有一張很美麗的………………的照片、」維像耐不住樣的、笑着說着、</p>
<p>「誰說是Lover不、不的、你們不要瞎說、現在旣然不敎下去、就退課吧、」克先生的臉、漸漸的紅暈了、他急速的離了敎室、那時下課鐘還没打動、而一片熱烈的歡樂的呼嚷聲代替了、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Appointed Chairman of the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>In the recent session of the League of Nations Committee, representatives from Germany, Austria, Russia, and France all gave compelling speeches on European economic issues. However, the speech by the British representative Henderson was the most sincere and stable. On the one hand, he proposed submitting the German-Austrian tax agreement to The Hague for review to mediate the German-French dispute. On the other hand, he declared to Russia that he had no intention of provoking the Soviet Union, and even wanted to increase close economic ties with it. As for economic issues, he advocated the establishment of a subcommittee composed of representatives from seventeen countries to review all proposals for saving the economic crisis for resolution. This is all in order to reconcile today's disputes. Now, Henderson has been publicly elected as the chairman of the International Disarmament Conference next year. Mr. Henderson knows that the senseless competition of armaments among countries is an important cause of the economic crisis. Therefore, he will be able to exert all his strength to curb military disputes when he takes over as chairman of the military conference in the future. The hope for the future of disarmament will surely rest on this. However, looking at the atmosphere of today's meeting, although the tax agreement issue has been agreed to be submitted to the court for review, the two sides still have many disputes. Although the Disarmament Conference has appointed a chairman, there are still many disagreements on the issue of publicizing armaments. Moreover, looking at the internal expansion of armaments in various countries, it is proceeding rapidly. When the so-called German 10,000-ton "monster warship" had its launching ceremony yesterday, the Germans were excited and enthusiastic, feeling that all previous failures would be recovered in this one ship. All countries were shocked by this. Reuters even said that it was a plan to overturn the calculations of world disarmament experts. Alas, what about disarmament?</p>

<h3>Henderson of the UK Elected Chairman of the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Meeting Location Set in Geneva</p>
<p>Issue of Open Armaments</p>
<p>British and German Representatives Hold Differing Opinions</p>
<p>German-Austrian Customs Treaty Negotiations</p>
<p>Berlin Declares It Will Continue</p>
<p>Bill to Save the Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Will Organize a Committee to Review</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th Dispatch from the National Press: The League of Nations Council unanimously elected British Foreign Secretary Henderson today as Chairman of the International Disarmament Conference next year. Mr. Henderson expressed his acceptance but must first seek approval from his home government before it is confirmed.</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th Dispatch from the National Press: According to a report from London, the British government has approved Foreign Secretary Henderson to serve as Chairman of the International Disarmament Conference next year.</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th Dispatch from Reuters: The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting this morning and decided that Geneva would be the location for the Disarmament Conference next year.</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th Dispatch from the National Press: Today, the League of Nations Council meeting discussed the highly contentious issue of open armaments among various countries. Germany proposed that trained reserve soldiers and stored military supplies should be included in the armaments list submitted to the League of Nations on a regular basis. The British plan advocated adopting the index table prepared by the Disarmament Committee, which did not mention the two items requested by Germany. Today, British Foreign Secretary Henderson began the discussion, stating that while the German plan aimed for accuracy, it was indeed a standard method and could be considered an ideal solution to the problem. However, its major drawback was that it would cause unnecessary disputes. We must consider the practical aspects, so the assembly should be satisfied with the table prepared by the Disarmament Committee. French Foreign Minister Briand stated that France could not agree to the German plan and was willing to accept the British proposal with some reservations. Subsequently, the German Foreign Minister spoke forcefully, arguing that only by including the two items of reserve soldiers and stored military supplies could a reliable comparison of the military strength of various countries be made. In the end, the meeting decided that, with both sides adhering to their respective positions, the issue would be postponed until Friday for further discussion.</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th Dispatch from the National Press: Today, the European Union Committee unanimously adopted Henderson's proposal to elect representatives from seventeen countries to form a subcommittee to review all the proposals to save the economic crisis. The subcommittee is now preparing to report the results of its review to the General Assembly on Thursday.</p>
<p>Paris, 19th Dispatch from the National Press: According to news recently transmitted by French journalists from Geneva, an economic conference of various countries will be held in late summer this year. It is reported that representatives from various countries in Geneva have been secretly discussing this matter and have principally approved it. All the plans proposed by various countries to alleviate Europe's difficulties will be submitted to a review committee for initial examination. The committee will study various materials and prepare a detailed plan for the General Assembly's discussion.</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th Dispatch from the National Press: Although the British proposal to refer the legal issues of the German-Austrian tax treaty to the International Court of Justice in The Hague has been unanimously passed by the representatives of various countries in the European Union Committee, debates continued in today's meeting, but without any significant impact. Among them, the Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia expressed considerable criticism of the German position declared by the German Foreign Minister, and German Foreign Minister Curtius also offered corresponding rebuttals. French Foreign Minister Briand stepped in to mediate and prevent further disputes, and British Foreign Secretary Henderson also delivered a sincere speech. (The following is a dispatch from Reuters) stating that Europe is currently in an unprecedented and severe economic panic, with people suffering from unemployment and hunger, while Europe and overseas countries have grain overflowing from their warehouses but unable to sell it, and trillions of funds are stored idly in banks. He also stated that an atmosphere of international security and freedom from the fear of war is the first necessary condition for economic recovery. President Hoover said that if disarmament is successful next year, the world panic can be reduced. How insightful this statement is! Public opinion in many countries is gradually understanding the unnecessary suffering caused by economic nationalism and is gradually advocating the procedures of international joint action under the League of Nations. Currently, a large part of Europe urgently needs people to provide it with finance, but countries with surplus capital are unwilling to lend. Trade barriers are obstacles to prosperity. What the British government is most concerned about now is the issue of reducing tax rates. Those countries that use various methods to exclude foreign goods only make themselves and others miserable. Creditor countries demand repayment of debts but refuse to accept the goods that can be offered, demanding only cash. Therefore, the demand for gold is great, and prices plummet wildly. In fact, international trade must be in the form of exchange. He also hoped that the representatives would not harbor the idea that the member states of the League of Nations are currently plotting to start a war against Russia. What the member states of the League of Nations hope for is to increase peaceful exchanges. If the Russian representatives can offer assistance based on mutual adherence to international obligations to help realize their hope, it would be welcomed by the member states of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th Dispatch from the National Press: Although the German-Austrian tax treaty is being discussed in Geneva and undergoing legal review in The Hague, the governments of Germany and Austria will continue negotiations as usual to complete the customs union. The German government declared today that Germany firmly believes that it has found a way to save the economic crisis in the customs union between the two countries. This belief has not changed in the slightest to this day. According to reports, after the League of Nations Council decided to submit the German-Austrian tax treaty issue to the International Court of Justice for review, the German representative stated that even if the International Court of Justice recognizes that this action does not violate existing treaties, the French government still believes that it will endanger the stability of the European situation and will ask the League of Nations Council to conduct political and economic research on it. British Foreign Secretary Henderson also stated that after the Hague ruling, the United Kingdom would not oppose actions deemed reasonable by the French government. However, Germany insists that the League of Nations Council can only conduct a legal review. Therefore, it is still negotiating with the Austrian government to formulate a treaty form based on the principles that have already been achieved. The contradiction between the views of Germany and France is such that this move is expected to become a major issue in the European political situation in the future. Both sides will fight to the death against each other, which will be protracted and not resolved in a short time.</p>
<h3>Red Terror in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Communists Attempting Arson and Riots</p>
<p>Plans Leaked, Did Not Materialize</p>
<p>Over 170 People Indicted</p>
<p>Left-Leaning Ideologies of Youth Concerning</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th Dispatch from Reuters: The news of the third indictment of the Communist Party by the police authorities in February 1930 has only now been allowed to be recorded by newspapers, which is quite shocking. Matters such as the number of police casualties, the redization of higher education groups, and the purchase and transportation of military supplies with the intention of burning down the National Assembly and other public offices are all unexpected. In Tokyo, a total of 173 communists and 36 sympathizers have been indicted, including some university professors and famous writers. It has been found that 93 party members have received specialized education, of which 31 are graduates of the Imperial University and 16 are graduates of Waseda University. Moreover, two of them are lecturers at the Imperial University. Most of those arrested are under the age of 30, and there are seven women.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th Dispatch from the Electric Communication: Centering on the May Day holiday last year, Communist Party members distributed unstable leaflets everywhere, attempting to get all city workers to join the Communist Party. Some also demonstrated against officials, causing a considerable number of police officers to be injured or killed. The Communist Party initially planned to take advantage of the May Day rally in Shiba Park to launch a major riot and arson. Fortunately, the authorities were prepared in advance, so they were able to prevent the disaster.</p>
<p>At dawn on May Day last year, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department gathered more than 1,000 emergency guards and deployed them at Shiba Port, Miharabashi, and Ginza to maintain strict vigilance. Meanwhile, they surrounded the home of Sasamori Koichiro, a labor activist in Hatagaya, Shibuya Ward, confiscating 500 bamboo spears, more than 20 cans of gasoline, and more than 30 red flags. In addition, there were short swords, handguns, etc., which were instructed by the Communist Party headquarters to have about 500 party members carry these weapons to attack the police officers and start a riot when parading in Shiba Park on that day. At the same time, gasoline was to be used to set fire to the Metropolitan Police Department and other locations in one fell swoop. The authorities were able to prevent the disaster because the Communist Party headquarters leaked the secret, it is said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th Dispatch from the Electric Communication: Since April 30th last year, dozens of incidents of Tokyo police officers being attacked have occurred. The main ones are as follows: (1) On the morning of April 29th, Nishijima, a Waseda University student, slashed Officer Sato in Shimototsuka. (2) On the same night, near the Shinjuku branch office of the municipal streetcar outside the city in Yodobashi Tsunohazu, someone beat Officer Ichikawa with an iron rod, causing serious injuries. The perpetrator escaped. (3) Imperial University student Soga Masao stabbed Officer Yoshi in the abdomen with a short sword in front of the Ishikawa Island Shipyard in Kyobashi Hososhima. (4) On the morning of April 30th, Toriumi Shigeru slashed Officer Hasumi in front of the municipal streetcar Otsuka vehicle station. (5) On the same day, Kin Tohwan, a Korean law student, beat Officer Kano in front of the Syueisya factory in Ichigaya Kaga-cho, Ushigome. (6) On May 1st last year, an attack on the police officers with bamboo spears and pistols occurred in Kawasaki City, resulting in numerous serious and minor injuries. In addition, there were more than ten similar cases. In each case, the perpetrators carried weapons and attacked officials.</p>
<h3>World Strike Wave</h3>

In the Dobrowa coal mining area, 40,000 people are on strike due to wage reductions. In the Berezno area, the unemployment of 7,000 workers has led to large demonstrations and riots. Workers in the Boryslaw oil fields have also decided to declare a general strike starting on Thursday. Today, streetcar and bus drivers across the country have declared a general strike in opposition to the new tax. At the same time, civil servants across the country have been holding meetings everywhere because their salaries, which were approved to increase by 15%, were suddenly canceled. Even officers in the military have been affected by this movement. Rumors are flying everywhere, and the situation is extremely tense, so there is talk of the National Assembly convening an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>Sweden</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th Dispatch from Reuters: A wave of strikes has occurred in various parts of Sweden for several days. Riots suddenly broke out today, and the police are finding it difficult to suppress them. It is reported that these riots were incited by organized communists and those sympathetic to Soviet Russia. The rioters held flags that were unfavorable to the government. When the police tried to seize them, they were refused by the rioters. The two sides then clashed, with the rioters throwing stones at the police, and the police using batons to attack them, resulting in many injuries and hospitalizations. Order was restored only at midnight.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>Paris, 20th Dispatch from the National Press: The textile strike wave in northeastern France is becoming increasingly serious, but the Ministry of the Army is able to take advantage of the opportunity to meet the needs of the military.

<h3>Austrian Cabinet Wavering</h3>
<p>Vienna, 19th Dispatch from the National Press: The Austrian Greater German Party decided to withdraw its party representative in the cabinet, Attorney General Nolff, causing the cabinet to waver.

<h3>Shang Zhen Returns to Shanxi from Beiping</h3>
<p>Carrying 1.5 Million Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Military Pay for Shi Yousan and Others Also Decided</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Shanxi Provincial Government Chairman Shang Zhen, with a million yuan in bandit suppression funds borrowed and cigarette tax and deposits from Shanxi Province, arrived in Beiping from Tianjin on the 16th. He left Beiping at 6:00 am on the 17th, carrying the funds in three private carriages attached to the Ping-Shi train. Because Shang was carrying a large amount of military pay, the Deputy Commander's Headquarters dispatched 20 soldiers to escort him to Shijiazhuang, where he switched to the Zhengtai Railway to return to Taiyuan. Shang carried a total of 2 million yuan, originally intending to convert it all into silver dollars for transport to Shanxi, so the journey was repeatedly delayed. To date, 500,000 yuan have not been converted, so he only carried 1.5 million silver dollars, with the remainder in banknotes, packed into 310 boxes. Shang told people in the carriage that Shanxi's political affairs were complicated. After coming to Beiping, he originally intended to return as soon as possible, but negotiations for the bandit suppression loan took a considerable amount of time, so he was delayed until now. Before boarding the train, he telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief, Deputy Commander, and Yang Aiyuan, reporting everything. Shanxi generals love peace and have issued a telegram supporting peace. In the future, they will only strive for the peaceful unification of the country and seek construction during the period of political tutelage. Those who traveled to Shanxi with Shang included Hu Yiling and Luo Chengwei. Luo was ordered to investigate the tax situation in Shanxi in order to implement new taxes. Hebei Province will implement the special commodity production and sales tax first, and Shanxi will decide on the measures after the investigation. It is also reported that the military pay for the Shanxi army and the troops of Shi Yousan, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, etc., and other issues have recently been substantially decided after discussions between Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Chiang. The solutions that Deputy Commander Zhang discussed with the generals in Beiping were fully agreed upon by Chairman Chiang. Starting in May, all armies will receive their pay according to the new pay regulations. In order to make the central government's intentions clear to the northern armies, Deputy Commander Zhang specially sent commissioners north to various relevant parties to announce everything. The generals of the northern armies have jointly issued a telegram supporting peace to show their sincerity in obeying the central government. (May 18th)</p>
<p>Cai's Division Defeats Red Bandits at Chenggang</p>
<p>Gong, Hao, and Other Divisions Encircle Donggu</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Dongshao is located north of Ningdu, bordering Guangchang, Nanfeng, Le'an, and Yongfeng. Red bandit Zhu De is entrenched there. Gao's division of Sun Lianzhong's 26th Route Army advanced towards Ningdu after capturing Dajinzhu. It mutually supported the 6th Route Army in Guangchang on the left and the 5th Route Army in Yongfeng on the right, encircling and suppressing the bandits in Dongshao and Luokou. The Executive Headquarters recently received two telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Sun Xianxiao stating that they occupied Shuikou, Dongshao at noon on the 16th, killing many bandits. The remaining bandits retreated to the Dongba, Hucenba, and Shixi areas. On the 17th, they advanced in victory and occupied Luokou, killing many bandits as well. It is very close to Ningdu City. It is reported that Sun's troops will clean up the scattered bandits and peasant bandits before advancing to Ningdu City.</p>
<p>Chenggang, northwest of Xingguo, between Donggu and Longgang, is also one of Zhu's important bandit nests. The 19th Route Army was originally divided into two routes to suppress them. Jiang's division detoured from Zhongzhou Dongcun Gulonggang (dozens of miles from Ningdu City) to the side and went straight to Ningdu City. Cai's division, from Longgang Tou Chenggang, surrounded the south of Yongfeng Donggu, connecting with Gong's division in Taihe and Hao, Guo, and Tang's divisions in Yongfeng. The Executive Headquarters yesterday received a telegram from Cai Tingkai Xian stating, "Our army attacked and advanced towards Chenggang on today. The bandits could not withstand the attack and collapsed towards Liangcun, Donggu. Over 400 bandits were killed on the spot, and over 100 rifles were seized. The remaining bandits are being pursued by a team." According to reports, Peng Dehuai's red bandit troops in southwestern Jiangxi have completely concentrated in Donggu. Gong's division has cleaned up the bandits in Taihe and occupied the bandit areas of Guping, Gupo, and Langkeng west of Donggu. Hao, Guo, and Tang's divisions have also occupied Tantou to the north of Donggu and Longgang Biaohu to the southeast. The bandit area of Donggu is only dozens of miles away. The bandits have only a little over a thousand guns, so Donggu can be expected to be recovered during the day. (May 18th)</p>
<h3>Lu Nan Troops Encircle and Suppress Bandit Guo</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The various Lu Nan suppression troops have been dividing their forces for days to fiercely suppress bandit gangs. Guo Mafeng's unit, after fleeing back to Mengshan, has only about five or six hundred remnants, hiding in the northeast area of Pingyi Ji. Ma Tengjiao, Gu Liangmin, and Wang Wanqing's troops are currently intercepting and suppressing them. The Third Route Army's staff office stationed in Tengxian recently received two telegrams reporting the bandit suppression situation. (1) According to Brigade Commander Ma's telegram, the first regiment searched and captured several bandits in the west slope area of Dongwangwan and executed them by shooting. They seized two guns, ten bandit flags (all blue with red borders, three feet square), a forged passport with the words "Wu, Commander of the Lu Nan Guerrilla Force," five covenant documents with the words "Headquarters of the Shandong Guerrilla First and Third Detachments," and twenty-four blank forged military badges, etc. Also, according to Division Commander Gu's telegram, Regiment Commander Kong Xiangcheng led the mixed first regiment and was expected to arrive in Wangjiawan on the designated date to assist the Lu Nan militia in attacking and suppressing the remnants of Guo Mafeng, which should be wiped out soon. Furthermore, orders have been given to all units to continue their efforts in searching and suppressing, and to follow the Chairman's telegram regarding Zou, Teng, Yi, Lin, Fei, Meng, and Si counties to seriously handle the "clearing the countryside" (清鄉) and thoroughly investigate household registrations. All self-defense firearms must be numbered and branded, and anyone found harboring bandits or collaborating with them will be severely punished to prevent the source of chaos. (2) Guo Mafeng's bandit gang and other remnant bandits in the barren mountains, totaling five or six hundred, are currently entrenched in the Wangjiazhai and Wangong areas northeast of Pingyi. Regiment Commander Kong Xiangcheng has been ordered to lead the mixed first regiment to join the Lu Nan militia in suppression, with the aim of eliminating them as soon as possible. (17th)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Cracks Down on Multiple Kidnapping Cases</h3>
<p>Eight Bandits/Communists Executed</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan is an important town on the Yangtze River, with a mix of Chinese and foreigners. Many bandits use concessions as safe havens to secretly plot activities. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, through strict vigilance, has successively cracked down on no less than dozens of bandit/communist organizations. Recently, two more kidnapping cases were cracked, and eight bandits/communists were executed, further stabilizing the market order. Earlier, in the Wudaocun area of the 37th district of Wuchang County, several bandits kidnapped Wu Chuanxue and his wife from Wu Hongfa's store. Wu's wife was rescued by the defense team, but Wu was taken to Han (Hankou) and a ransom of twelve thousand dollars was demanded, to be exchanged at the Pinghan Railway's Chenjiaji north of Dazhimen. However, Wu was taken to Han and, while the bandits went ashore to buy food, he seized the opportunity to escape and reported to the third district that the bandit den was near Baofu Temple. The district sent Wu to the Wuchang County Office, and with the help of the regular team, three communist bandits who colluded with kidnappers, Zuo Yurong, Chen Guohua, and Xu Qingfu, were arrested at Baofu Temple. According to their confessions, the bandit leader moved to a concession in Hankou and admitted to joining the Communist Party. They were then sent to the garrison headquarters by the county office for interrogation. At the same time, the kidnapping of a child surnamed Wang occurred in Lijiaqiao, Qianjiajie, and Taiping Township in Wuchang County. The countryside clearing bureau sent a team to apprehend the criminals, first capturing Hu Doufu and Yang Zhifa, followed by Zhu Lianrui in Zhifang, Yang Yurong outside the Dazhimen Railway in Hankou, Fang De'en, Zhou Xingfu, Wang Baoshan, and Li Xiushan in Yangjiawei, Mei Er, Mei Ruiyuan, and Mei Ruixuan in Jinkou, Zhang Yuan in the dike factory, and Li Shunquan and Huang Wanxing in a smoking den. In total, seventeen kidnappers were apprehended in Wuhan, all of whom were sent to the garrison headquarters for interrogation. Those who confessed without hesitation, such as Zuo Yurong, have been executed. Their crimes are as follows: (1) The Hankou Public Security Bureau presented three kidnappers, Liu Mingshan, Chen Yaoqing, and Yuan Zenan, and the Wuchang County Government presented two communist bandits who colluded with kidnappers, Zuo Yurong and Chen Guohua. The criminal Liu Mingshan had colluded with Qian Xingwu and others to kidnap Huang Dongshan, a wealthy household in Suizhou, and killed Dongshan. He then sneaked into Hankou to participate in robbing money houses. Zuo Yurong and Chen Guohua were both communist bandits who colluded with Chen Yaoqing and Yuan Zenan to rob the Wu family. Their crimes were serious and all were sentenced to death. (2) The Headquarters Inspection Office arrested a bandit, Liu Guanghua. According to his confession, he joined the "White Wolf" bandits in the early years of the Republic and disturbed the five provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. After the "White Wolf" bandits were eliminated, he was wanted in his native Yingshan. He hid in the army and later lived in Liujiamiao in Hankou, colluding with bandits and dividing the spoils. He should be sentenced to death according to the law. (3) The Headquarters Inspection Office presented Chen Youzhang, a communist bandit from Tongshan who was hiding in Hanyang. According to his confession, he served as the chairman of the puppet soviet government and the chairman of the riot committee in Gaokengbu, the fifth district of Tongshan. He led the crowd to break into the city, burned down government offices, and released prisoners many times. He kidnapped people for ransom and confiscated countless properties, killing hundreds of people. His actions were shocking and he should be sentenced to death according to the law. (4) According to the Wuchang Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the bandit Yang Guixiang was arrested. According to her confession, she communicated with bandits and initially robbed merchant Chen Sanyuan and others of cash and promissory notes on the road in Jiayu. Later, she openly went to Yingwuzhou to redeem the promissory notes. She should be sentenced to death according to the law for punishing bandits. (May 19th)</p>
<h3>Tang Kesan Discusses Methods for Mediating the Kang-Tibet Dispute</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Tang Kesan, Director of General Affairs of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Liu Zanting, a specialist of the Commission and former commander of the Sichuan-Tibet Han Army, and Tang Musheng, a Kang-Tibet inspection commissioner, who were sent by the central government to Xikang to mediate the property dispute between Dajin Temple and Bai Lishi's office, arrived in Rong (Chengdu) on the 3rd of the month and stayed at the Military Academy Research Association of the 24th Army. Tang made a statement regarding the Da-Bai case, the main points of which are as follows: (1) In the Da-Bai property dispute, the Dalai Lama believes that such matters are extremely common in Kang-Tibet and can easily be resolved within the sect without involving the government. The local government of Xikang believes that when people file such lawsuits, it cannot ignore them and shirk its responsibility. Those who are unreasonable and rely on strength to disobey should naturally be sanctioned. The central government believes that the Dalai Lama is currently demonstrating sincerity, and the settlement methods for the Panchen Lama and Nuona Lama have not yet been agreed upon. If the central government does not make concessions and show leniency, the Dalai Lama will suspect that the central government is outwardly agreeing to allegiance but secretly ordering troops to advance. A small impatience will lead to major chaos. Therefore, the central government has repeatedly issued strict orders to restrain the officers and soldiers from starting another war. If the Tibetan troops disobey the restraint and continue to advance, the fault lies with the Dalai Lama, and it will not be too late to issue an explicit order for suppression. (2) Since the property dispute occurred, the Dalai Lama was confused by the one-sided statements of Dajin Temple and the troops stationed in Kang-Tibet, and failed to prevent the troops stationed in Kang-Tibet from assisting the rebel actions. After receiving the central government's order to stop military actions on both sides and wait for officials to be sent for fair resolution, the Dalai Lama ordered the Changdu Kalon to order Degge Gutong Daiben to withdraw his troops, and telegraphed the central government to welcome the dispatch of officials to Kang to resolve the issue in accordance with the order. Therefore, I was ordered to travel to Sichuan as soon as possible. Once my luggage arrives from Chongqing in a few days, I will rush to the front line to relieve the people of Kang from their suffering as soon as possible. (3) Before both parties hold their own views and the actual situation is not fully understood, I will never prejudge the solution with preconceived notions. Even if a solution is proposed in the future, it must be submitted to the central government for explicit instructions. I cannot act arbitrarily. Whether the Dalai Lama's sincerity towards the central government is genuine or not will be observed in this matter. As for the mediation method, the first step is to directly negotiate with the Kalon, ordering them to defend their original defense and restore the situation before the war. The second step is to investigate where Da-Bai's right and wrong lies, and fairly mediate so that both sides are satisfied. Otherwise, I will only report the actual situation to the central government and listen to the truth. In short, I have no definite certainty at the moment as to what extent I will be able to do in the future, but I must go deep into Zi or Degge and do my best to live up to the people of Kang and the party and country.</p>
<h3>Shocking News of Haiyuan Pavilion's Book Collection Falling into Foreign Hands</h3>
<p>Brokered by Pan Fu to be Sold to the Japanese</p>
<p>Most of it has been shipped from Tianjin to Dalian</p>
<p>Shandong Education Department Published a Statement Warning</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Liancheng Yang family's Haiyuan Pavilion book collection, except for those that have been damaged or sold, is now stored in Jinan and Tianjin. The ones in Tianjin are mostly famous Song and Yuan editions, of immense value. The ones in Jinan are ordinary books, unimportant. The Ministry of Education and the Shandong Education Department were deeply concerned that the books would fall into foreign hands. The Shandong Provincial Library Director Wang Xiantang was instructed to draft the "Draft Outline of the Agreement on Yang's Haiyuan Pavilion Books" to preserve the books. The methods include Yang entrusting the library to preserve them on his behalf, or semi-donating and semi-selling, or the government purchasing them at a fair price, asking the book owner Yang Jingfu to choose one. Yang expressed his willingness to accept the second semi-donation and semi-sale method. Although the two sides have not yet had formal negotiations, indirect contacts have been made several times. Wang Xiantang also planned to go to Tianjin in the near future to formally consult with Yang and investigate the number of books and agree on the price so that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, it was recently learned that the books were sold to the Japanese through Pan Fu's introduction. The matter concerns the loss of Chinese cultural relics, which is quite shocking. According to a letter received by the Shandong Provincial Library Director Wang Xiantang from Tianjin, Yang's Haiyuan Pavilion collection has recently been mortgaged to a certain bank for 400,000 yuan through Pan Fu's introduction. In other words, it was sold to a certain bank. It is reported that the books have recently been transferred from Tianjin to Dalian via the post office. The buyer is Japanese, and the transaction will be formally concluded soon. After receiving the letter, Wang reported it to the Education Department. The Education Department decided to publish a warning in the Tianjin and Jinan newspapers, stating that the Haiyuan Pavilion collection is related to Chinese culture and is the property of China. Shandong should have the priority to purchase when Yang sells it. During this negotiation period, foreigners must not buy or sell it without authorization. At the same time, Library Director Wang Xiantang was sent to Tianjin to investigate the truth. Wang was ordered to set off north on the 20th. It is reported that the reason why Yang sold the books to the Japanese this time was that he feared that selling to domestic government agencies would result in a loss in price. Selling to the Japanese would get a higher price. Therefore, after the government agencies proposed a method a few days ago, foreign and Chinese book dealers continued to visit Yang's door to negotiate purchases. (May 18th)</p>
<h3>The Dangerous State of Northeast Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Groups of Poor People Break into Rich Families for Food</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Northeast rural areas have recently entered a dangerous state. According to investigations by those who have experienced the situation firsthand, it has reached a point where it is full of tragic scenes and the sound of wailing. Generally speaking, the rural areas in various parts of Northeast China are extremely exhausted. However, if we analyze it, their current situation has different points. On the one hand, they suffer from having abundant grain in storage but difficult to find customers. On the other hand, they are plagued by lack of food to feed their families or lack of seeds to cultivate the fields. This contradictory phenomenon is most prominent in the disaster areas of western Liaoning. For more than a month, the so-called "eating big families" (吃大家, meaning poor people gathering to eat at rich people's houses) trend has occurred successively in various places. Because it is currently the spring plowing season, most poor households not only lack seeds for plowing but also lack food to feed their families. Therefore, they support the old and carry the young, forming groups and going to rich people's houses to eat together. The number of people is as many as several thousand, and as few as several hundred. Those responsible for maintaining law and order are also unable to take action, resulting in the poor becoming even poorer, and the rich also becoming poor. Counties such as Liaoyuan, Tongliao, Shuangshan, Kangping, and Faku in Liaoning Province, and Fuxin and Chaoyang in Rehe Province, are particularly tragic. It is reported that due to the continuous rain and disaster last year in Shuangshan County, the autumn harvest was less than one-tenth of previous years. Officials and people are in extreme distress. Police and education salaries have been in arrears for several months, and it is almost impossible to cook. Currently, about half of the rural households in the four townships lack seeds and food. Between April 22nd and 26th, five days, several groups of poor people crowded into the county seat to demand food. Each group numbered from more than 1,000 to 2,000 or 3,000. In Tongliao County, two groups of poor people "eating big families" also appeared on May 2nd and 11th. When the county government sent people to comfort them, they often knelt down and cried for help. The situation in other counties is also generally the same, so I will not elaborate. As for the authorities' response, in addition to the county magistrates and local gentry temporarily raising food, distributing it by name, and persuading them to return home, they also telegraphed the province to request relief. The Liaoning provincial government had previously proposed allocating funds to help spring plowing, but in reality, it did not have any effect. (May 15th)</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Meeting of the Security Corps Committee: The county government previously received orders from the province to organize security corps in various districts and appointed "clearing the countryside" (清鄉) inspectors to supervise in Songjiang. The county government convened a meeting to organize the Security Corps Committee and decided on the list of security corps in various districts, requiring them to be submitted by May 15th. Today (20th), the county government convened the Security Corps Committee to discuss funding and other issues. The attendees included the district head Zhong Taishi and more than a dozen appointed committee members such as Ni Bingshi. County Magistrate Jin presided over the meeting and discussed the issue that only a few districts had submitted the list of security corps within the time limit. It was decided to extend the deadline by half a month and strictly require all districts to submit the list as soon as possible for organization. As for the fundraising methods for the Security Corps funding, it was the general consensus that since the lists have not yet been submitted, it is impossible to estimate them for the time being. It was decided that a meeting should be convened again after the lists are submitted to decide.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob on the Road: Dai Bingnan, Deputy Director of the Jiangdu County Court Detention Center, was ordered to transfer to the Jiangning District Court Detention Center. After visiting his family in Changan Alley, Zhabei, Shanghai, he arrived in Suzhou on the 19th by train. He planned to visit Huang Jinming, a former colleague from the old Wu District Court, at No. 10 Tongren Street in the city, to travel to Beijing together to take up new positions. After getting off the train, he immediately hired Yin Rusong's rickshaw to enter the city. At the entrance of Tanggong Alley under Chongzhen Bridge in Dongzhong Market, more than a dozen hooligans suddenly rushed out from the tiger stove in the alleyway, dragged Dai out of the rickshaw, violently beat him, and robbed him. A total of 50 yuan in banknotes from the Bank of China, a piece of woolen fabric, and several other cosmetics were robbed from his bag. He still had 50 yuan on him, but because Dai shouted for help, the police on duty arrived and it was not taken. Afterwards, Dai reported to the 16th Precinct, and Inspector Xu Yubing led the police to the scene, arresting Zhou Liqiang, the owner of the tiger stove, and forcing him to lead the arrest of the robbers. At 2:00 AM that night, three principal offenders, Liu Afu, Zhang Laosan, and Liu Jinhai, were arrested at Zhang Laosan's house at No. 38 Tongren Street, along with six suspects: Ju Fulong, Lü Liubao, Zhang Liansheng, Chen Jinrong, Chen A'jin, and Liu Renshui. All were taken to the station. During interrogation, Liu Afu and others confessed to colluding with Zhang Laosan, Liu Jinhai, and Wang Xiaowu (who is still at large) to rob pedestrians. However, they denied robbing the 50 yuan in banknotes. After the interrogation, they were transferred to the branch bureau for further investigation at 4:00 AM yesterday (the 20th).</p>
<p>Appeal Hearing for the Murder of Wife Case: Hu Yinglong, an employee of the Songjiang Dianye Bank, was accused by his wife's younger brothers, Zhang Zeqian and Zhang Zexu, in the Songjiang County Court of conspiring with his stepmother, Hu Nie, to murder his wife, Zhang Wenrui. The Songjiang County Court acquitted Hu Yinglong and Hu Nie on March 30 of this year. However, the prosecutor of the Songjiang County Court appealed to the High Court, and the remains were sent to Suzhou along with the case file. Yesterday (the 20th), Zhan Yufen, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Division, held a hearing, summoning the deceased's brothers, Zhang Zeqian and Zhang Zexu, to testify. Hu Yinglong and Hu Nie hired lawyers Sun Yuan and Zhang Baopei to defend them. Hu Yinglong testified first, stating that he was 32 years old, a native of Songjiang, and worked in the banking business. In February of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he married Zhang Wenrui. They were usually on good terms. On the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, his wife asked him for money, and they had an argument. In the middle of the night, she hanged herself on the bed railing. He immediately took her down and reported the news to the Zhang family on the eighth day. The two Zhang Zeqian brothers also came to help with the funeral arrangements. They accused him of strangling his wife, but that was not the case. Hu Nie testified that she was 43 years old, and Yinglong was her nephew. He and his wife had always been on good terms. She didn't know about their argument on the seventh day of the seventh month last year. On the morning of the eighth day, her nephew told her that Hu Zhang had hanged herself. She went to his room, but the body had already been taken down. She did not go to the autopsy. They accused her of helping to murder Hu Zhang, but that was not the case. Zhang Zeqian testified that he was 26 years old, from outside the West Gate of Songjiang, and worked as a pawnbroker. Zhang Wenrui was his older sister. On the morning of the eighth day of the seventh month last year, Hu Yinglong first sent someone to report that his sister was suffering from acute cholera. Less than five minutes later, another messenger came to report that she was dead. He and his younger brother Zexu went to the Hu family together. When they arrived at his sister's room, the body was on the bed, with her eyes half-closed. He immediately suspected Hu Yinglong's uncles, Hu Runzhang and Hu Runde, who told them not to get close to the body, because his sister died of an epidemic and they feared it would be contagious. Hu Runzhang then asked him to write a funeral announcement. On the ninth day, the coffin was sealed and the funeral procession returned to the Hu family. They asked Hu Yinglong about the cause of his sister's death. Hu Yinglong said she had hanged herself. Later, they became more suspicious, and on the eleventh day of that month, they reported to the Songjiang County Court, requesting them to send someone to examine the body. On the twelfth day, Prosecutor Luo supervised the opening of the coffin. The examination revealed that the deceased had indeed been strangled to death by someone before her death. Prosecutor Luo then compared Hu Yinglong's hand to the wound, and it matched very well. Therefore, they accused him of murder, etc. Zhang Zexu testified that he was 24 years old and worked in the grain business. After his sister married Hu Yinglong, their relationship was just so-so. After receiving news of his sister's death from the Hu family, he went with his brother. At the time, he saw marks on his sister's throat. He wanted to report it to the Songjiang County Court to request an examination, but Hu Runzhang and Hu Runde dissuaded him. They accused him of murder because they reported that she died of a sudden illness. He asked them to produce a doctor's diagnosis, but they could not. Later, they requested an examination, and Prosecutor Luo determined that the deceased had indeed been strangled to death. He also requested the presiding judge to review Hu Yinglong's confession in the first instance, which included the statement, "I don't get along with Hu Zhang, but I get along with Hu Nie. Why do I get along with Hu Nie? Because Hu Nie doesn't allow me to get along with Hu Zhang." This shows that Hu Zhang's death was undoubtedly a conspiracy between Hu Yinglong and Hu Nie. After hearing the testimony, Judge Zhan stated that the case still required investigation of evidence and that the coroner who conducted the examination needed to be summoned to testify before another hearing and debate could be held.</p>
<p>Military Police Shoot and Kill Bandit: At 11:00 PM on the 19th, four bandits were on the roof of a house in Waikuatang Town, using a flashlight to look down. A member of the defense corps spotted them and immediately reported to the night-duty corps member, who set out to search and arrest them. At the same time, Zhao Wancheng, the platoon leader of the 6th company of the 1st regiment of stationed military police, also heard the alarm and led his troops to surround and arrest them. The defense corps climbed onto the roof to pursue them. Three bandits escaped by jumping off the roof, while one bandit ran around on the roof, crossing more than a dozen houses. He jumped off the roof into the river to escape, but was shot and killed in the river by the military police.

<p>Tragic News of Parents Killing Their Own Child: Gong Hongbao, a resident of Yuhang Street, Xidiao Bridge, outside the West Gate of this county (a 25-year-old native of Jiangyin), opened a clothing store there, and his business was doing well. Five years ago, he had an affair with a 47-year-old woman, Jiang Chen. They were intimate and acted like husband and wife. In a few years, they had a son named A'gen (3 years old this year). After the birth, Jiang Chen, due to her old age, had no milk, so she sent the child to the countryside to be raised. Last autumn, she brought him back to raise herself. Unexpectedly, after the child was brought back, he cried incessantly all day long, which angered Gong Hongbao and his wife. On the night before yesterday, they used a sewing needle to stab dozens of needles into the child's face, causing blood to flow like a stream and his breathing to weaken. He died yesterday, which is truly tragic. The neighbors learned of the incident and, feeling indignant, came forward to negotiate with Gong, advocating reporting to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<p>Two Hostages Released from Fenshuidun: It is learned that in Fenshuidun Town, at the border of Xiwuyi, a large gang of more than 30 bandits entered the town and robbed and kidnapped five men and women as hostages some days ago. It is now known that Wu Runfu, the eldest son of Wu Peida, the owner of the kidnapped hotel, and Zhang Jinhai, a shop assistant, were released from the bandit den yesterday after a plan was devised. Wang Wenlin, Liu Shi, and her daughter, however, remain in the bandit den awaiting ransom.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Kunzhi Ferry Overturns Cargo Ship: Yutai Clothing Store, located in Xiaodongmen of this county, has a strong capital base. Every year, it must send personnel to Shen Su Xikun and other places to buy old goods in pawnshops. On the 13th of this month, Wang Xianting, the manager of the store, and several partners went to Kunshan Baoyuan Pawnshop to buy goods worth more than 7,800 taels of silver, packed into 17 large packages. They hired a civilian boat and loaded it on the 18th to transport it to Changshu, entrusting a clerk, Gao Deyuan, to escort the load. Because it was inconvenient to row the boat, it was hooked to an inland river ferry, the Jia'e, traveling between Changshu and Qingyang Port, to be towed. Unexpectedly, when traveling in Kuncheng Lake, the wind was quite strong and the waves were very rapid. At that time, a Kunzhi Ban (Kunshan to Zhitang) ferry, the Jia'e, was sailing and suddenly wanted to overtake the boat in front without sounding its whistle, causing the Yutai Clothing Store's cargo ship to be overturned. The clothes and packages placed in the ship were all overturned into the river. The ferry immediately stopped and tried to salvage the clothes and packages. The clothes inside were all soaked in water, especially the fine fur goods, which suffered the greatest loss. The manager of the store is now directly negotiating with the Changqing Bureau, requesting compensation.</p>
<p>Defense Corps Seizes Large Number of Bandits: The Nansha District of this county is located on the coast, and bandit cases have occurred frequently and are difficult to solve. It is now learned that among the bandits, due to a dispute over the issue of snatching a wife, internal strife occurred. One of the bandits, Guan Guihou, a native of Fuxing Town, recently married a new wife, bought from a certain Tang for 80 yuan overseas. The woman's beauty moved the bandit leader Liu Shiyuan, who planned to take her for himself. At the same time, another bandit also planned to make a move, but he had no money, so he held a grudge and went to report it to the defense corps for arrest. Unexpectedly, Guan had already heard the news and escaped first, only capturing one accomplice, Zhou Yuanhou. Zhou San then revealed the locations of the various bandits in his confession, which were within the territory of Nantong. He then joined forces with the Tong Defense Corps and successively arrested Zhou Jin and Liu Yuegen in Fuxing Town. Later, Xue Laoer and Qian Guotai were arrested in Youche Port. When arresting the Qian bandit, Qian Pinlan, the captain of the Fourth District Defense Corps, stepped forward to knock on the door. Unexpectedly, many people rushed out from inside and opened fire to resist arrest. Qian was shot and immediately fainted. The corps members also opened fire in retaliation. The two sides fought fiercely for two hours before the bandits were unable to hold out and retreated. Captain Qian has now gone to the Shazhou City Hospital for treatment. The bandits are all temporarily detained at the corps headquarters.</p>

<p>Bandits Burn Victim: In the Fangjia Village area of ​​Situ Temple Fort in Yishus, there is a person named Chou Yongkang, whose family runs a mill and the business is quite prosperous, thus arousing the covetousness of bandits. Around 2 AM the night before, more than 20 bandits suddenly came and rushed into the house, each holding a handgun, demanding money from Chou. Chou replied that he had no money. The bandits were furious and searched again and again, but found nothing. They then pressed Chou to the ground and burned his back with straw, causing burns in several places. Later, the bandits, because it was about to dawn, did not dare to linger for a long time, so they limited Chou to raising 500 yuan within four days, and agreed to pay the money at Saogou Mountain outside the West Gate, using a lamp as a signal. After speaking, they roared and left. Chou's injuries are now quite serious, and he has already been taken to the city for treatment.</p>

Unexpectedly, a certain Shan and others from Laisuxiang outside the East Gate claimed it was public property, abruptly making things difficult and forcing him to return the boundary. Because Zheng was forced to do so, he hanged himself from a tree on the mountain on the 15th. The next day, his family found him and thought he had been strangled, so they petitioned the court on the 17th for an examination and ordered a strict arrest of the murderer.

<h3>Exhaustion of Education Funds in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Recent Expenditure Situation of the Department of Education</p>
<p>丨Middle Schools and Rural Normal Schools Paid Up to March丨</p>
<p>丨Experimental Primary Schools Paid Up to April丨</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Education, recognizing that the recurring expenses of various educational institutions in the province were in arrears for several months, making it difficult to maintain operations, urgently needed to find ways to provide relief. In addition to constantly consulting with the management office to find ways to raise funds, it also submitted a request to the provincial government on May 12, ordering the Department of Finance to clear all the provincial treasury subsidies for this year within a set period to facilitate turnover, and also wrote to the management office to find ways to borrow to meet urgent needs. It is now known that up to recently, the expenses of various provincial middle schools and social education institutions have been paid up to the first half of March, the expenses of middle schools and rural normal schools have been paid up to the second half of March, and the expenses of various experimental primary schools have been paid up to the first half of April.</p>
<h3>Document from the Jiangsu Department of Education to the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Document No. 216 from the Jiangsu Department of Education to the Provincial Government states: Case investigation: The provincial treasury subsidized 300,000 yuan for provincial education expenses in the 19th year. The committee meeting of your government previously decided to include it in the local budget of the 19th year, and it was also decided to divide it into twelve months and allocate it monthly on average, ordering the Department of Finance to comply with the record. Now, there are only a little over a month left before the end of the year, and this subsidy for rural expenses has been in huge arrears due to the provincial treasury's financial difficulties. At this time of weak tax revenue, the education expenses management office has exhausted all its resources, and the recurring expenses of various educational institutions have only been paid up to the first half of February, except for the half month of March that has been paid to various experimental primary schools. Various institutions have been in arrears of funds for a long time, are in dire straits, find it difficult to maintain operations, and have submitted petitions for relief one after another to avoid difficulties. It has been found that the above-mentioned provincial treasury subsidy funds have long been included in the budget and are earmarked for specific purposes. It is clear that the current provincial treasury is in financial difficulties and it is difficult to cope. However, considering that various educational institutions are eagerly awaiting funds, if ways are not found to provide relief, the impact on the future of education will be profound. Therefore, this document is prepared and submitted to your government for review. It is earnestly hoped that the Department of Finance will be ordered to find ways to allocate the unpaid subsidies for this year in full within a set period to facilitate turnover and meet urgent needs. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted, Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee, Chen Hexian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Department of Education to the Education Expenses Management Office</h3>
<p>Public Letter No. 310 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education states: Case According to various provincial schools and educational institutions, the recurring expenses have been in arrears for a long time, making it difficult to maintain operations, and requesting relief, etc. Based on this, it is found that this year's education expenses have been affected by the previous year's famine. Although the actual income and expenditure in the budget are not significantly different, the expenditure has been exhausted, and the recurring expenses have been in arrears for many months. It is true that it is difficult for your office to allocate funds due to the emptiness of the treasury. Various educational institutions are in dire straits, awaiting funds to maintain operations, which is also the real situation. Relief should be urgently sought to maintain operations. The above-mentioned situation is hereby reported. Please check and consider doing your best to find ways to allocate funds, or still follow the old practice of previous years, find ways to borrow to temporarily maintain operations, and hope to see a reply.

Now, I have received another letter from the school representative of secondary schools, saying: Direct Startup: School expenses have been in arrears for three months, the mountains are exhausted, and it is difficult to maintain. Colleagues gathered and discussed at Zhenjiang Middle School on the 30th of last month. Everyone said that the noble office is in charge of education expenses, and is responsible for collecting, paying and issuing. If one is in charge of arrears and ignores it, trapping the school in a desperate situation, what will happen to guilt? Er is consistent in the decision, please give priority to this month by the 25th, and issue the arrears before April, otherwise colleagues will not be responsible, but from June 1st, the advance leave is forced, the situation is forced, it is really impossible. The noble office should not sit back and ignore it, etc. Except for a letter reply, the corresponding is another Feng Da, that is, Xi Chazhao, and quickly meeting the rescue method, I can't wait for the order, this is the Jiangsu Education Expenses Committee, Su Education Management Office replied to the representatives of the principals of middle schools, saying: Straight resumption: Jiezhan's big letter, Bei Renyi is also one of them. In view of the fact that the Beidi Office previously prepared and issued the regular expenses of each school, Yan urged the counties to pay the tax money within the time limit, in order to gradually allocate and clear the arrears of each school, the tax revenue of each item, and the present value of the light month. The exchange of letters and telegrams, and the dispatch of personnel to supervise and collect, has had little effect. It was requested by letter that the Education Expenses Committee convene a meeting to discuss ways to rescue the cases. Now we are trying to raise as much as possible, and it has been approved by the Audit Committee to fill in and issue one month's expenses for each middle school, each institution, and each practical small school.

<h3>Tu Weizeng Discusses the Sino-Soviet Conference</h3>
<p>Currently Discussing the Railway Redemption Issue</p>
<p>Ordered to Collect Materials in Beijing</p>
<p>Mr. Tu Weizeng, a special commissioner for the Sino-Soviet Conference, was ordered to return to Beijing to report on the progress of the negotiations. He arrived in Shanghai the other day. A reporter made a special visit to inquire about the latest developments of the Sino-Soviet Conference and the economic situation of Soviet Russia. According to him, he and Special Commissioner Wang Zeng'en arrived in Harbin on April 24th. After a brief stay, they took the land route to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing, they repeatedly met with Foreign Minister Wang and Vice Minister Wang to report on the progress of the negotiations. On the one hand, they were ordered by Representative Mo to collect reference materials from the railway and foreign affairs departments. It seems that when Representative Mo was in Beijing last time, he collected a lot of materials and personally took them to Russia for reference, but due to the urgency of time, they were not complete enough. Therefore, this time, taking advantage of the opportunity, he ordered Tu Weizeng and Wang Zeng'en to find ways to supplement them and take them with them for use. As for the Sino-Soviet Conference, the first formal meeting was held on April 11th. Our side immediately put forward the outline for railway redemption, and the other side also put forward a counter-proposal. At the second and third meetings, discussions on this proposal began and are currently ongoing. As for the issues of commerce and resumption of diplomatic relations, they have not yet been mentioned. In short, if the Russian side has sincerity, it will not be difficult to resolve the matter satisfactorily. Whether or not Russia has sincerity depends on the domestic political situation. Regarding the economic situation of Soviet Russia, because it is currently the time to implement the Five-Year Economic Plan, all parties are tightening their belts and striving to implement it. Regardless of its ideology, its spirit and perseverance are worthy of emulation. He will return to Beijing within a few days to sort out the collected materials and plans to go north to Russia in early June. The newly appointed special commissioner Xu Jianping will not go to Russia for the time being.</p>
<h3>Madame Zhang Xueliang, Yu Fengzhi, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seeking Medical Treatment in Shanghai, Returning to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Madame Yu Fengzhi, wife of Deputy Commander Zhang, along with her secretary and attendants, arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing the night before last. At 6:35 yesterday morning, she arrived at the North Station and drove to the Cangzhou Hotel to rest. She is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Station Welcome: Yesterday morning, the area near the North Station was protected by armed police officers dispatched by the Public Security Bureau, as well as detectives from the Garrison Headquarters and Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Works Department, who were on standby on the platform. The military band of the Public Security Bureau also arrived at the station to play music to welcome her. Those who went to the North Station to welcome her included Zhou Xiangxian, a counselor from the Ministry of Finance, Tang Liu, the director of the Foreign Affairs Office, Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief, Jiang Yi, the chief of the adjutant office of the Garrison Headquarters, Shen Nengyi, the director of the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Qian Jiechen, among others, totaling more than ten people.</p>
<p>Resting at Cangzhou: At 6:35 yesterday morning, the train entered the North Station. Madame Yu's private carriage was attached to the last car. Those who came to welcome her rushed to meet her. Madame Yu, wearing a short black velvet coat and a light-colored cheongsam, stepped slowly out of the car. Amidst the military music, she walked out of the platform and took a special No. 7777 car prepared by Mr. Du Yuesheng and went straight to the Cangzhou Hotel. At that time, Madame Song Ailing, the wife of Kong Xiangxi, arrived at the Cangzhou Hotel by car to greet her and met her at the entrance, and hand in hand they went inside to rest.</p>
<p>Accompanying Figures: Those who accompanied her included Wu Jingan, the director of the Siping-Taonan Railway Bureau, Miss Zhu Si, Wu's wife, Li Yingchao, Deputy Commander Zhang's secretary, the secretary of Miss Darnell, the American advisor to the Deputy Commander's office, and nine guards.</p>
<p>Kong Residence Banquet: Madame Yu and others rested briefly at Cangzhou, and then traveled in the same car with Madame Kong to the Kong residence on Avenue Haig. A doctor from the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital was called to the Kong residence to treat Madame Yu's ailment. A banquet was held at the Kong residence at noon to welcome her. In the afternoon, she went to major companies to purchase miscellaneous items. In the evening, she attended a banquet hosted by Madame Song, the old lady, on Seymour Road. After dinner, she went to the Grand Theatre to watch a play.</p>
<p>Zhang Has Arrived in Tianjin: Last night, Mr. Shen Nengyi received a telegram from Tianjin, asking to be forwarded to the Deputy Commander's wife: "The Deputy Commander, along with his two sons and attendants, arrived safely in Tianjin at 2:10 p.m. today." Therefore, Madame Yu urgently needs to return to the north and has decided to take the night train at 11:45 tonight back to Beijing and then take the Jinpu Railway north.</p>
<h3>American Congressmen to Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Group of Five in Total</p>
<p>Arrival Expected on June 2nd</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News", the American Commercial Counselor received a telegram from his country yesterday stating that three American senators and two members of the House of Representatives, who are coming to China to investigate the silver issue, will arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. Senator Pittman will be on the President Jefferson ship and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on June 2nd. It is estimated that they will stay in China for about a month.

They will first go to the Philippine Islands and then come to China. They will also arrive in Shanghai on June 2nd. They plan to travel to North China and then return to Shanghai, passing through Manila, and returning to San Francisco on July 24th. Furthermore, retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Clark will also come to Shanghai from Manila on the same ship. U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Hienton will come to Shanghai from the United States on the President Hayes. The American Chamber of Commerce in this city is currently preparing to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Closure of the Sand and Gravel Industry</h3>
<p>Successful Petition Results</p>
<p>Following the unanimous closure of the sand and gravel industry in the city due to opposition to the provincial government's increased levies, representatives petitioned various authorities yesterday. The results were very satisfactory. The Ministry of Finance has also issued instructions to investigate and cancel the levy. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sand and Gravel Industry Meeting The Sand and Gravel Trade Association held a meeting the previous evening (the 19th) at 7:00 PM to discuss the issue of the closure and devise countermeasures. More than 300 members attended. The chairman, Lu Xiaozuo, resolved the following items: (1) The industry-wide closure is a major issue, with implications for local stability. Representatives should be dispatched to various locations to actively dissuade [from adding additional levies]. Simultaneously, documents should be prepared by Lu Xiaozuo and Wu Longhai to report to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to take measures to address the issue. (2) A notice should be published in the newspaper to encourage members of the association to resume business immediately. (3) The objectives of the petition are: (A) To request the prohibition of the collection of the onerous tax imposed by Da Chang and Yi Tai, which is similar to a disguised likin, with a newly added management fee of seven coppers per ton, within Jiangsu Province. (B) To request a submission to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to immediately revoke it. (4) To submit a request to the National Government's Ministry of Finance and the municipal party and government organs, stating the reasons and requesting the cancellation of the management fee.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Petition Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Sand and Gravel Trade Association dispatched representatives Lu Xiaozuo, Wu Longhai, Ye Zhen, Gong Bin, and others, six people in total, along with a petition letter, to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Bureau of Social Affairs. As a result, the authorities agreed to forward the request to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction to cancel the increased levies and advised the representatives to resume business first and await a resolution. The representatives were satisfied and withdrew.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instructions The Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Received a telegram, stating that the Sand and Gravel Trade Association of this city has submitted a letter to the Zhejiang Department of Construction regarding the collection of sand and mud production and sales taxes. The situation is presented and a request is made for cancellation." The instructions read, "The telegram has been received. A consultation will be sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate and cancel the tax. Please comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submission The Municipal Chamber of Commerce further submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, stating, "Submitting [this] concerning contractors extorting sand and mud taxes, leading to a shutdown of business, requesting examination and approval, and swift orders to exempt [the tax] in order to stabilize business affairs." This was regarding a case on the 20th of this month, based on a letter from the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Trade Association (the original letter appeared in yesterday's newspaper). Upon investigation, it was found that on May 4th, the association had previously stated that the Zhejiang Province's contracted collection of sand and mud production tax was essentially a disguised likin. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting an order to cease the collection. Subsequently, on the 19th of this month, a response was received under the reference number [number], stating that a consultation would be sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate and cancel the tax, and compliance was requested. The contractors responsible for collecting this sand and mud levy should immediately comply with the order to cease collection. However, the two tax collection companies, Da Chang and Yi Tai, are using high-pressure tactics, detaining goods and people, leading to an industry-wide shutdown. At a time when likin is being vigorously abolished, this illegal extortion is occurring. If this is not strictly rectified, where will government orders be placed? It is appropriate to submit the situation to your ministry and bureau for review, promptly issue a strict order to cease collection, and find ways to alleviate the situation, thereby stabilizing commerce. This is for the public good." This was respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>Investigation by the Public Works Department The Public Works Department of the Public Concession sent a special commissioner to the Sand and Gravel Trade Association yesterday to investigate the situation due to the sand and gravel shutdown, which could affect municipal construction projects, in order to find ways to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Declaration by the Construction Industry The Construction Industry Association believes that the sand and gravel shutdown is greatly related to construction projects in the construction industry. If it is not resolved soon, construction projects will inevitably be suspended. Therefore, it issued a notice yesterday, scheduling a meeting on the 23rd (Saturday) afternoon to discuss countermeasures and inviting the sand and gravel industry to participate.</p>
<h3>Slaughter Shutdown by Concession Butchers</h3>
<p>Bureau of Finance Requests Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Persuade [Them] to Resume Business</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry in this city has been closed for six days due to the slaughter tax issue. Butchers in the Public Concession took unified action yesterday, and the French Concession side has also confirmed a slaughter shutdown today. The various situations obtained yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Slaughter Shutdown in the Concessions More than 300 shops, including Lu Gaojian and other fresh meat businesses in the Public Concession, have uniformly stopped importing goods and are implementing a shutdown starting yesterday in order to assist fellow businesses in the northern and southern parts of the city. As a result, the Juxing Slaughterhouse on Yuezhou Road, the Renyuan Slaughterhouse on Jiaxing Road, and the Ninghai Slaughterhouse on Dawang Temple Road have already ceased slaughtering yesterday. However, the Public Works Department Slaughterhouse on Huasheng Road and the Suxi Slaughterhouse on Dawang Temple Road will cease slaughtering today due to existing pigs. More than 300 shops, including Fang Yongda and other fresh meat businesses in the French Concession, have confirmed that they will stop importing goods and implement a shutdown today. As a result, the Public Works Department Slaughterhouse on Nanyang Bridge will also cease slaughtering. The association sent letters to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Public Works Department yesterday, requesting protection.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Directive The Municipal Government issued a directive to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Based on a report requesting that the municipal slaughter tax continue to be paid according to the original assessed amount, and requesting the cancellation of pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection fees," and "The two reports have been noted. The municipal slaughter tax has been collected for a long time in the past. Recently, this government approved a request from the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office to collect and remit [the tax] on its behalf, and the collection of the new tax did not increase the tax rate. The cancellation of contractors and direct collection was originally intended to streamline tax regulations, simplify collection procedures, and provide convenience to merchants and the public without causing harassment. Furthermore, the tax rate is different from the tax amount. This government is collecting according to the originally set tax rate, which is in accordance with the methods set by the ministry. The statement in the report that [this] violates [the regulations] is a misunderstanding. As for the pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection fees, these are hygiene procedure fees, not taxes. The request for approval is difficult to grant. Please inform [them] accordingly."</p>
<p>Bureau of Finance Reply The Municipal Bureau of Finance replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Responding directly to your association's Public Letter No. 88, regarding the resolution passed by the Fresh Meat Industry Association of this city, requesting the cancellation of the slaughter tax and the conversion to a business tax, and the uniform cancellation of the pre-slaughter fee in the concessions, the post-slaughter fee in the interior, and the inspection fee for technicians in the four rural areas. Furthermore, if the municipal government's plan to build a new slaughterhouse is implemented, the industry will feel inconvenienced and requests the revocation of the order, with the industry continuing to operate in separate districts. In addition, the municipal government's purchase of tickets for tax collection was extended to the 15th. After the expiration date, please do not force the purchase of tickets again. Before the business tax is changed, the industry will continue to pay the original assessed amount." The reply stated, "Upon approval, the tax collection by contractors easily leads to the abuses of control and monopoly, and the legitimate tax revenue is often misappropriated, which has long been criticized by society. As your letter states, the abolition of the contractor system is a proper measure in terms of tax system theory. Moreover, under a revolutionary government, efforts should be made to eliminate it as much as possible in order to comply with the tax system. This bureau was ordered to take over the slaughter tax and collect it directly in accordance with the original tax rate, without increasing any burden on the meat merchants. Reading the interview with Mr. Zheng Chengqing, the general manager of your association, published on the 17th of this month, [he] stated that the municipal slaughter tax has always been paid by the industry association. In the southern city, it is 3.9 coppers per pig, and the remaining amount is allocated to charitable causes. In Zhabei and rural areas, it is borne proportionally by the industry." This proves that this bureau's collection by counting heads is not an innovation, and the tax amount collected is not arbitrarily set. As for the proportional burden in Zhabei and rural areas, regardless of how it was proportionally allocated during the commercial operation era and whether the method was fair, just in the southern city, the tax rate is different from the northern city, and the burden on the citizens is inevitably uneven, and the tax rate lacks standards and violates the principles of taxation. Now that it has been taken back for self-operation, how can fairness be served if it is not collected by counting heads? If the contractors did allocate the remaining amount to charitable causes when they contracted to operate [the tax], the industry association may submit [a report] to the municipal government in the future to seek a remedy. As for continuing to pay the original assessed amount and following the old system of commercial operation, it is practically impossible to do so. In addition to reporting to the municipal government, a corresponding reply is sent, and you are still requested to investigate the original intention of the letter of May 9th of this year and earnestly persuade [them] to resume business quickly, without being foolishly misled and causing losses to themselves." This was addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Opinion A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday regarding the slaughter tax issue and asked for his opinion on the case. [Wang] replied, "The Chamber of Commerce has always taken a mediating attitude to assist in resolving this case. In my opinion, the southern city actually collected 3.9 coppers in the past, while the northern city and rural areas were allocated according to the amount, averaging less than two coppers. Now, in order to unify the tax rate, the tax rates in the northern and southern cities should be statistically analyzed and a fair tax rate should be set, which would be fairer. Therefore, I recently advocated reducing the tax rate. On the one hand, the funds for charitable causes that the meat industry handled in the past should also be appropriately subsidized. Then, this case may be resolved. Fortunately, the business tax in this city will be launched soon, and it may be possible to set a temporary method as a transition."</p>
<p>Request from Pig Dealers The Fresh Pig Dealers Association stated that the shutdown of meat merchants has had an impact. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting mediation to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The correspondence is recorded below: (1) The letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated, "Respectfully submitting, upon investigation, the Fresh Meat Industry Association requested to change the slaughter tax to a business tax, and the reasons are legitimate. However, the authorities failed to understand, causing a unanimous expression of closure. If it were not unavoidable, who would be willing to sacrifice? This kind of unavoidable suffering is clearly evident here. Fortunately, your association is mindful of the difficulties of merchants, advocates fairness, and is providing relief. [We] are extremely grateful. Furthermore, this association and the fresh meat industry are in the same boat, and [we] are even more concerned. [We] deeply fear that prolonged delays will trap the meat industry in a difficult situation. [We] dare to ask your association to make every effort to mediate in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and [we] cannot bear the hope that the merchants of Suzhou will be out of trouble." (2) The Chamber of Commerce replied, "In reply, received your letter stating that the fresh meat industry requested to change the slaughter tax to a business tax, and the shutdown of business is an expression of the inevitable. Please mediate to resolve the issue." Upon investigation, this association has previously submitted the difficulties of the fresh meat industry to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Finance, requesting leniency and adoption. Replies have been received and forwarded separately. Now, based on the letter, [we] will wait for the opportunity to mediate. If there is room for mediation, [we] will do our best. This letter is sent for your information.</p>
<h3>Chen Youren Visited Sun Ke Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Youren, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, has been residing in Shanghai for several months since returning from Europe this spring. It is learned that Chen visited Sun Ke on Moliai Road in the French Concession by car at 9:30 AM yesterday for the sake of the Guangdong situation. The discussion lasted for a long time, and [he] left at 11:40 AM.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in This City Send Telegrams Urging Chen Jitang and Others to Awaken</h3>
<p>Since Deng, Gu, and others issued a deletion telegram and Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, issued the Guangdong telegram, people across the country have sent numerous letters and telegrams, either expressing opposition or urging them to awaken. The Municipal Executive Committee of this city has already sent a telegram of advice yesterday. Party departments and mass organizations at all levels in this city have sent telegrams expressing their opposition to the actions of Chen and others. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from the First District Party Department To the public compatriots of the country, our party has led the people and devoted itself to the National Revolution for nearly fifty years. Countless martyrs have shed their heads and countless compatriots have shed their blood in order to eradicate all reactionary elements, advance from the military government period to the tutelage period, and hope to start anew with the people and work hard on construction projects. Recently, in accordance with the teachings of the Generalissimo, we convened a National Congress, formulated a provisional constitution, and prepared to hand over the political power that our party has fought for for fifty years to the people. All national affairs are resolved in accordance with the provisional constitution. Unexpectedly, Chen Jitang, with his suspicion and cruelty, falsely accused and wantonly attacked, picked up frivolous words, and issued declarations, venting his private anger and disregarding the foundation of the country. It should be known that impeachment at the National Congress has its own corresponding procedures, and party affairs are decided by the party, without the need for military intervention. Wielding troops against the government will inevitably lead to final destruction. Zhang, Huang, and Feng are clear evidence. Moreover, since the fall of the Qing Dynasty, internal strife and foreign troubles have followed one after another. Our compatriots have long been tired of the chaos. Today's peaceful situation is like gold. Upon hearing of the military valve's military action, everyone is discolored. All of our compatriots, with the opportunity of a hair's breadth, should rise up together, urge them to awaken, so that the ambitious warlords lose their support, so that the unaligned politicians have nothing to rely on, so that the future well-to-do situation of fifty years of struggle is not destroyed by a few soldiers, and the resolutions of the National Congress convened by the Generalissimo's will are implemented in turn, then the success of the National Revolution and the realization of the Great Unity world are expected events. This association is willing to lead the comrades in this district to follow the compatriots across the country, unanimously oppose [them], so that the ambitious people have their own fears and dare not act recklessly. This is the declaration.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Second District Party Department (Title omitted) Since the party launched the Northern Expedition in the 15th year, it has gone through more than five years of struggle, experiencing many difficulties and sacrifices. The heads of many loyal and patriotic people have finally gained a unified and peaceful situation. However, the neighboring powers still have not reduced their desire to invade. The scourge of the rampant bandit communists in the country is even more serious. It is still necessary for us to continue our efforts to resist foreign aggression and eliminate domestic troubles, so that we can restore the inherent status of our nation and ensure the permanent welfare of our nation. The four supervisors, Gu Deng Lin and Xiao, are not mindful of this and are surrounded by political hooligans.</p>

<p>They picked up frivolous words and issued the 30th telegram. Later, it was corrected by the central government, thinking that the matter could be resolved. Unexpectedly, Chen Jitang did not examine it and re-issued the Guangdong telegram in response. According to foreign reports, Guangdong has fallen into a state of military affairs. Such behavior is suspected of military intervention, and [he] has abandoned himself to the party and the country. This association deeply regrets this. In addition to telegraphing to advise Comrade Chen not to be a criminal who destroys unification, this special telegram requests all circles to uphold justice and safeguard the party and the country. The Shanghai Special City for the Second District Executive Committee, Hao Yin.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Third District Party Department (Title omitted) The National Congress has just celebrated its closing. In terms of internal affairs, construction steps have been put on track, and in terms of external affairs, it has been resolved to automatically announce the abolition of unequal treaties, removing the shackles that have been suffered for decades. All those who love the party and the country should be of one heart and one mind, so as to place the Chinese nation in a realm of freedom and equality. However, at the beginning of the congress, the four supervisors, Gu Deng Lin and Xiao, picked up frivolous words and issued a telegram on the 30th, and at the closing of the congress, there were comrades who did not observe the facts and blindly followed. Comrades are entrusted with heavy responsibilities. How will they face the Generalissimo, the party and the country, and even the 400 million compatriots? We must be vigilant and awaken, and maintain the overall situation together. Only good people can choose to listen to good words, and only wise people are not afraid to correct their mistakes. We dare to express our advice briefly. We hope that the comrades will understand (omitted below).</p>
<p>Telegram from the Fifth District Party Department Since our party led the National Revolutionary Army, the edict was issued to go out to the Northern Expedition, relying on the efforts of the comrades and the soldiers' obedience, [we] were able to quell the warlords and roughly announce unification. This year, on the anniversary of the Generalissimo's inauguration as the Extraordinary President, the central government followed the Generalissimo's will and felt the needs of the facts and convened the National Congress in the capital, gathering the heroes of the country in one hall to discuss the major plans of the party and the country and determine the construction program. [We] are delighted that the realization of the Three People's Principles can be expected and the completion of the Great Unity of the world is hopeful. However, the supervisors Gu Deng and others picked up frivolous words and arbitrarily issued a telegram on the 30th to confuse the people and attempt to shake the foundation of the country. Chen Jitang of Guangdong echoed and was willing to be used by politicians, thinking of sending troops without a name and acting to destroy the central government. Upon investigation, Gu Deng and others, as central supervisors, even if they have any suggestions to the central government, they should present them to the central government according to law and wait for processing. How can they arbitrarily issue telegrams, make irresponsible remarks, damage their personality, and be abandoned by the people of the country? Chen of Guangdong is a military commander appointed by the central government. Obedience is his duty, and disobedience is tantamount to reaction. Moreover, the red bandits in Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangdong have not yet been wiped out, and the abolition of the treaty has not yet been a fact. At this time, it is up to the whole country to be of one heart and one mind, resisting foreign powers and eliminating the red atmosphere internally. Chen's actions are nothing less than creating opportunities for the red bandits and giving excuses to imperialism. The central government has always been generous and forgiving. If Chen and others repent and awaken, the central government will not create any difficulties for them. If they are still obsessed and do not wake up and cut themselves off from the party and the country, they can only present a request to the central government to issue a clear order for crusade. This is a telegram for your information.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Political Gatherings in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Permission from the French Chief Patrol is Required First</p>
<p>The French Chief Patrol has found that there have been unauthorized gatherings in violation of the regulations of this concession recently. He has re-promulgated the warning of the French Consul General's decision in Article 13 of the organizational charter of the French Concession Public Works Bureau on May 3, 1927, and notified the detective office of the special agency's political department to various groups. The original text is excerpted as follows: (1) Political gatherings, offices, joint meetings, or any groups may not be held or established in the French Concession without the permission of the French Consul General or his committee. (2) Anyone wishing to open a similar gathering, establish a similar office, form a similar joint meeting, or any group or individual, should submit an application to the French Chief Patrol for approval at least 48 hours in advance. The purpose of the gathering, the agenda of the meeting, the composition of the audience, and all details should be stated in the charter, or the purpose of the joint meeting or group should be reported, and the names of the responsible persons should be submitted.

<h3>Preliminary New Governance Project in Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Tombs, etc., within the Land Enclosure</p>
<p>Must be Moved Before the 20th</p>
<p>The construction project of the new governance houses in Shanghai County was originally intended to be contracted by Dafang Construction Company. After consultation, it was decided that not following the bidding procedures would have many implications. Therefore, a fixed date of June 1 has been set for the commencement of commercial bidding. In addition, all obstacles such as tombs within the land enclosure for the new governance were originally limited to being moved out by the 20th of this month. Now, the county government sincerely fears that the time may be insufficient for the various businesses, so it has specially extended the deadline to the end of this month to clear the obstacles. Yesterday, the head of the third district, Yang, was instructed to inform the various businesses to comply. On one hand, the financial and construction bureaus will purchase another acre of land to prepare for the relocation of unclaimed coffins.</p>
<h3>New Instruments of Weights and Measures Required by Various Industries</h3>
<p>A Deadline Should Be Set for Reporting and Production</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating, "In response to the promotion of the new system of weights and measures, we have sent a letter ordering the number of new instruments needed to be opened and sent to the meeting for compilation and forwarding. According to the reports from the soy sauce and seafood trade associations, a request has been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for the record, and the Measurement and Testing Institute has sent a letter in response. The bureau's approval number is 10168, stating that the above has been noted. It is said that the Seafood Trade Association of this city has always used the British pound as the standard. Now that the new system of weights and measures is being promoted, the association should still be instructed to use kilograms or municipal catties for the British pound in order to comply with the law. The deadline for standardization is approaching. The association should again inform the various trade associations to quickly report the types of new instruments required by the deadline so that they can be forwarded for production." In view of the fact that the implementation of the new system of weights and measures is imminent, the types of new instruments that each association should use must be reported by the deadline. Please do not hesitate to wait and see. The above-mentioned causes have been notified by letter to be complied with.</p>

<h3>Record of the Tongji University Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Tongji University in Wusong held its 24th-anniversary celebration and the unveiling ceremony for Mr. Yuan Guanlan and Doctors Bao Long and Berentze. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: The meeting commenced at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included figures from the medical and political/military circles of Shanghai, such as Tang Ying, President of Labor University; Shen Yi, Director of the Bureau of Public Works; Tian Sihan, President of the Agricultural School; Cheng Kuanzheng, Principal of Wusong Middle School; Yan Fuqing, President of Central University; Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education; Ruan Jiepan, former President of Tongji University; Sun Kangzeng, President of the Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Communications; Ma Lifan, Director of the Radio Administration of the Ministry of Communications; Yuan Xiluo; and other guests, totaling over a thousand people. The gathering was quite grand for the time. The three steles dedicated to Mr. Guanlan and the Doctors, with gold lettering on white stone, were erected in the middle of the walls on both sides of the auditorium.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Opening of the Meeting; (2) Everyone Stands at Attention; (3) Play Music; (4) Sing the Party Song; (5) Pay Deepest Respects to the Party, National Flag, and Portrait of the Premier; (6) Reverently Recite the Premier’s Will; (7) Sing the School Song; (8) Chairman's Address; (9) Guest Speeches; (10) President's Address (recorded below); (11) Play Music; (12) Ceremony to Open the Gates; (13) Unveiling Ceremony; (14) Photograph; (15) Adjournment.</p>
<p>School's Congratulatory Message: Our Tongji, founded on medicine and engineering, newly built and magnificent. Talented individuals of the past soared on high paths, with superb skills becoming the nation's glory. Aspiring students, seeing the sea, know the ford. Fine steeds travel thousands of miles, possessing precious jade. Celebrating this anniversary, presenting talents and skills, offering words of blessing, comparable to fine jade.</p>
<p>President's Address: President Hu Shuhua said, "Distinguished guests, colleagues, students, today is the 24th anniversary of our university. We are honored and grateful for the presence of Chinese and foreign guests. Compared to European and American universities with two to four or five hundred years of history, our 24-year-old university is nothing to celebrate. However, among all universities in China, while some were established earlier, perhaps none have experienced such difficulties and repeated destruction as our university. Therefore, the name 'Tongji' (同濟) was chosen to mean 'crossing a river in the same boat during a storm.' Fourteen years ago, we suffered the biggest storm, almost capsizing the entire boat. At that time, not only were our teachers and students oppressed by the French, leading to displacement, but also all our books, instruments, specimens, and buildings were confiscated. If it weren't for the dedication of Mr. Yuan Guanlan and other gentlemen, we wouldn't have today's 24th-anniversary celebration. Without Dr. Bao Long, there would be no medical school at our university. Without Dr. Berentze, there would be no engineering school at our university. Detailed information is available in the special publication and will not be repeated here. To commemorate the achievements of these three gentlemen, alumni have donated funds to erect three memorial steles in the Great Auditorium of Datongji University (a gift from the Tongguang Photography Society).</p>
<p>The unveiling ceremony will take place today. Simultaneously, the dedication ceremony of the newly built Physiological Research Institute will also be held today. Physiology is the most important basic science of the medical school, and construction was planned four or five years ago, but was hindered by a lack of funds. Only today can it be completed. The year before last November, I risked signing the contract for the construction of the Physiological Research Institute, knowing that temporary funding would not be available. We only hoped that the government would issue monthly operating expenses, and we would try our best to save two to three thousand yuan each month for construction costs. Unexpectedly, the war broke out last year, resulting in the non-payment of expenses for October, November, and December of last year, and over five thousand yuan for September to this day. Personally, I have been under pressure from all sides, and the mental anguish is truly indescribable. Fortunately, the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture subsidized 20,000 yuan, which allowed the completion of the water, electricity, gas, and heating equipment of the Physiological Research Institute. More than 70,000 yuan has been spent, but important instruments are still lacking. However, if we hadn't started construction the year before, everything would be more expensive now, and the school's financial resources would be even more difficult to cope with. For this, we must thank the support and efforts of all colleagues. Our university trains specialized talents in applied sciences, which is fully in line with the direction of educational facilities decided by this National Assembly. We hope that the government and society will provide full assistance, and that distinguished guests will provide full guidance, so that our university can continue to develop and prosper. Our graduates serve society with the spirit of scientific patriotism, enhancing the university's reputation. Students in school should study hard with the spirit of saving the country and being unwilling to neglect their studies, raising the university's status. By the time of the 25th-anniversary celebration next year, we will hold a more grand celebration."</p>

<h3>The Foreign Affairs Office is Preparing a Garden Party</h3>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wang will Attend the Reception</p>

<h3>US Restriction on Acidity of Egg Yolk</h3>
<p>Opinion of the Commodity Inspection Bureau's Response to the Ministry</p>
<p>Regarding the US restriction of egg yolk acidity to 5 degrees, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, based on a telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, deemed the matter to concern China's international trade and the health of US citizens. Whether the current US method of limiting acidity to 5 degrees is fair, and to what extent the limit should be relaxed so that both parties are not hindered, requires academic research and cannot be argued with empty words. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was ordered to conduct thorough research based on scientific methods and report back for verification. After receiving the order, the Bureau instructed Yuan Kaiji, a technician specializing in egg product inspection at the Livestock Product Inspection Division, to conduct a detailed and careful study and submit a preliminary report to the Ministry of Industry. The report stated, "According to the technician, after extensively researching egg product inspection books and past experience in inspecting dried egg yolks and dried whole eggs exported from Shanghai over the past year, the most common acidity is between 2 and 3 degrees, and those exceeding 5 degrees account for about one-sixth of the total exports. If Chinese egg merchants pay a little more attention, they should be able to cope with the US government's acidity limit of 5 degrees. After taking samples and conducting simple experiments, it can be inferred that if fresh and undamaged eggs are used as raw materials and the manufacturing process is very clean, even if egg merchants wait for a price and ship the eggs to the US, even if it takes a long time or they are stored at high temperatures, the acidity should not exceed 5 degrees. If Chinese egg merchants want to maintain their export egg yolk business, they should pay attention to selecting raw materials and improving manufacturing methods to avoid increasing acidity, which would give the US government an excuse." The Bureau also recommended, based on the test results, that the acidity of egg yolks inspected by various inspection bureaus for shipment to the US should be set at 4.5 degrees. Any exceeding this number should not be allowed to be exported to avoid being inspected and denied entry into the US after arrival, causing even greater losses to merchants.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Has Resumed Shipping Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 70 native cloth businesses in Shanghai have requested the tax authorities to exempt native cloth, which is a handmade product, from export duties. The suspension of shipping has lasted for exactly four weeks. Yesterday, cloth merchants went to the Jianghai Customs to declare shipments of native cloth bound for Dongbei (Northeast China), including Harbin, Andong, and Yingkou. There were no more problems. From yesterday onward, cloth merchants officially resumed shipping. According to Li Zuyong, Secretary of the National Revenue Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Director Zhang of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance sent a message to the Administration on the same day, ordering the Chief Inspectorate of Customs to exempt native cloth shipped from Shanghai merchants to various ports in Dongbei, in areas where the national revenue tax is not yet implemented, and to foreign countries such as Hong Kong and Nanyang, from customs duties and release them for shipment. The Administration was instructed to inform the various customs commissioners to comply. Upon learning that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs had received the order from the Chief Inspectorate of Customs, I went to the Shanghai Customs to meet with both Chinese and foreign Customs Commissioners Ding Guitang and Mei Wushi, urging the Customs to issue a public notice so that native cloth merchants could resume shipping as soon as possible. Cloth merchants have been resuming shipping since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Requests Relief from Coal Shortage - Reply Telegram</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang's Paper Industry Publishing</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province has been famous for its paper production since ancient times, so it can be said to be an important paper production area in history. Now, with the loss of ancient methods, a lack of desire for improvement, and a shortage of raw materials such as rattan and paper mulberry, there are few who pay attention in society, leading to stagnation and errors. The Zhejiang Provincial Government Design Council, in view of this, engaged in a province-wide paper industry survey. It took one year across 50 counties to complete. All kinds of charts will be compiled and statistically prepared by the Council, with a total of 43 paper-producing counties, 85 types of paper, a total capital of 5,090,028 yuan, an annual output value of 20,850,487 yuan, 24,437 vat households, 27,765 paper vats, and 126,856 workers. Looking at the above, the annual output value of paper in Zhejiang Province is indeed impressive. However, most of this huge sum of more than 20 million yuan is crude paper, only enough for superstitious paper foil qiao paper and packaging paper coarse paper. It is not as good as the output of Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces, although not abundant, but the products are more refined. Therefore, all papers for major uses in art and printing must be imported from foreign countries and Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces. The reasons for the decline are roughly (1) the degradation of papermaking technology, (2) the shortage of capital, and (3) the obstruction of transportation.

<h3>Fixed Sea Bridge Qining Temple Reduced River Ferry Fare</h3>
<p>Originally: 8 Copper Coins per Passenger</p>
<p>Reduced: 4 Copper Coins per Passenger</p>
<p>In order to facilitate transportation on both sides of the Huangpu River, the Municipal Public Works Bureau held a river ferry between the Fixed Sea Bridge on the west bank and the Qining Temple on the east bank. It officially opened on the 16th of this month. The original fare charged per person each time was 8 copper coins. However, most of the ferry passengers were workers, who believed the fare was too high and unaffordable, and requested a reduction. The Bureau believed that the city-run ferry was intended to facilitate the public and was not for profit. Therefore, it immediately obtained the approval of the Municipal Government to temporarily halve the original fare, charging 4 copper coins per passenger each time.</p>

Since assuming office, Xu and Gao have been very serious about their duties. For example, they have personally supervised the addition of electric lights to the wharves, the regulation of hawker stalls, the emphasis on cleanliness, and the maintenance of order, without shirking their labor. Currently, in view of the deep accumulation of sediment on the surface of the wharves, which hinders the berthing of ships, causes losses to shipping merchants, and has a far-reaching impact, they have reported to the Municipal Government to find a way to dredge the sediment. It is reported that approval has been obtained, and they are actively negotiating with the Dredging Bureau these days. Dredging should be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>Special District Court Yesterday Sentenced Xu Yabo to Songjiang</h3>
<p>Xu's Lawyer Declared Appeal</p>
<p>Detention in Police Station During Appeal Period</p>
<p>Taihu bandit leader Taibao A-Shu Xu Tianxiong was captured by Xu Pucheng, director of the First District of Jiangsu Water Police, and executed. Subsequently, all his accomplices were arrested one after another. Xu Yabo, former director of the First District of Water Police, was also arrested by Director Xu, along with the police, on suspicion of being an accomplice of A-Shu. Because the police opposed the transfer, extradition has not yet been granted. Yesterday morning, the case was reopened by Judge Ge Zhitan for continued trial. In addition to Xu Yabo, the defendants included Lu Fugen, Li Weishi, Wu Qianshi, Cao Feishi, Chen A-San, and other men and women, all of whom were escorted to court. First, Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that during the previous hearing, Xu Yabo had confessed that in January of this year, while living on Huanlong Road in the French Concession, a bandit threw a handgun, a letter, and a 200 yuan savings passbook from the Commercial Bank into his house.</p>
<h3>Intention to Frame and Incriminate</h3>
<p>The court ordered the police to investigate. The investigators have now confirmed that the head of the Western detectives, Robertson, detailed the investigation process. He said that he was dispatched to the French police to investigate and was told by Head of Police Lide that on January 15 of this year, Xu Yabo had sent a Mauser pistol with the number 31691 to the police station. The gun is still preserved, but the letter has been lost. As for the passbook, it was investigated by Chinese Detective Liu Zonghan, who should report it. Detective Liu immediately reported that he had asked Chinese detective No. 147 of the French police about the passbook. The Chinese detective only said that he had</p>
<h3>Heard Xu Yabo Mention It</h3>
<p>But he did not know the details. At that time, the lawyer representing the water police requested that Xu and others be handed over to the relevant authorities for investigation and handling, since they had been captured by the water police district. However, the Songjiang County Court also sent bailiff Fu Zeguang to court, claiming that Xu Yabo was greatly involved in the case of burglary at Xu Zixian's house in Xin Zhuang on December 19 of last year, and requested that the suspect be handed over to the County Court for interrogation. Xu Zixian, the victim of the burglary, also hired lawyer Hong Shihao to represent him in court, agreeing to extradite Xu to the Songjiang County Court for thorough investigation, saying that two robbers involved in the case had been arrested and were currently being interrogated in the County Court. Since Xu was related to the case,</p>
<h3>He Should Be Jointly Punished</h3>
<p>Xu Baipeng, the representative of the burglary victim in Xin Zhuang, testified about the details of the burglary and the types of property lost, including a Commercial Bank savings passbook for 200 yuan. After the incident, he informed the bank of the theft and requested that payment be stopped if found. Later, the bank notified him that Wang Gengting had used the passbook to withdraw money, saying that a lawyer had ordered him to go to the bank to withdraw it. He then came to Shanghai to ask the lawyer about the origin of the passbook. The lawyer said that Xu Yabo had given it to him to offset the legal fees for handling the case. Now that the Songjiang Court has captured two thieves, and Li Wenjun, who was previously arrested, seems to be the same hemp-clad robber during the robbery. When questioned, Xu Yabo admitted that he had given the passbook to the lawyer to offset the legal fees, but he could not detail the origin of the passbook. It was thrown into his house at the same time as the handgun. Chen LianDe picked it up at the time, Chen used to be a patrol officer when I was director, and is now a patrol chief in Chuansha County. Lawyer Yuan Xilian and Liu Zimao both knew about the passbook being thrown. At this point in the testimony, lawyer Yuan happened to be listening in court, so Judge Ge ordered Yuan to testify. According to him, he went to Xu's residence one day to</p>
<h3>Demand Legal Fees from Xu</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the lawyer also arrived because of the legal fees. He then saw Xu hand him a passbook, instructing him to try to withdraw money from the savings bank. However, he did not know when the passbook was thrown in. Judge Ge, because all the witnesses had been interrogated, ordered the lawyers from each side to begin their arguments for a long time. At the conclusion of the arguments, prosecutor Li Yi stood up to state that the defendant Xu Yabo, regarding the acquisition of the savings passbook,</p>
<h3>Has Significant Suspicions</h3>
<p>Since the theft case has been accepted by the Songjiang County Court, Xu should be transferred to that court for joint investigation. Judge Ge then ruled that Xu Yabo be handed over to the Songjiang County Court for the police to take him away and investigate. The other five male and female suspects, Lu Fugen, will still be detained for further evidence and interrogation. The police lawyer then stood up to state that Xu should still be detained at the police station during the statutory appeal period. Thereupon, Xu's defense lawyer immediately declared that he still had to appeal the ruling. Judge Ge then announced that Xu Yabo would be returned to the police station during the appeal period, and the detectives immediately took Xu away for detention.</p>
<h3>Dong Yu's Wife Sues the Special District Court</h3>
<p>Telling the Story of Abuse</p>
<p>Requesting Confirmation of Identity</p>
<p>Paying Appropriate Alimony</p>
<p>Dong Yu's wife, Jiang, submitted a statement to the Shanghai Special District Court, stating that she had been abandoned by her husband and asked the court to confirm her identity and provide alimony. The plaintiff, Jiang, was originally from central Anhui and followed her husband to Jiang Zuo. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, she was introduced by her relative, former Minister of Justice Dong Kang, and betrothed to the defendant, Dong Yu's nephew, Xun Yu. In the winter of that year, the defendant formally married Ms. Lu in Jinan, Shandong. When the plaintiff's family learned of this, they wrote to Dong Kang to inquire. Dong Kang advised Dong Yu to quickly terminate the marriage contract to avoid future disputes. The defendant said that there was no problem with Jiang being the wife and Lu being the concubine. His cousin Dong Banggan provided a letter to prove the plaintiff's identity. In the ninth month of the lunar calendar in the eleventh year, the defendant came to Shanghai to live with the plaintiff's family. Everything was simple, and the necessary wedding expenses were about 300 yuan. All clothes and jewelry were missing. The plaintiff also thought of her simple life and only hoped to maintain a happy family, never mentioning the details. Only ten days after the marriage, the plaintiff scraped together travel expenses and went north with the defendant. For the first three months, they were still loving. Later, because his position as an appointed clerk in the Shandong Higher Court was poorly paid, he asked to live with Ms. Lu. The plaintiff reluctantly agreed to his request. Unexpectedly, after entering the door, Ms. Lu actually managed the household affairs. From then on, the treatment was very different. In the spring of the twelfth year, the plaintiff returned south for childbirth. She told her mother's family everything and asked Dong Kang to convey to the defendant that he should improve her treatment and confirm the status of wife and concubine. The defendant then wrote a paper, guaranteeing everything. In the autumn, the plaintiff gave birth to a daughter and returned north. Before a month had passed, he was dismissed from the court and returned south. The defendant, being unemployed, sent the plaintiff back to her mother's house temporarily. After mediation, he was taken back to live together. After a few months, he abused and expelled her. The plaintiff entrusted Suzhou lawyer Lu Hongyi to send a letter of inquiry, but the defendant ignored it. In recent years, the defendant has been engaged in the practice of law, not so successful. Later, after mediation, the plaintiff was welcomed back in the spring of the eighteenth year and placed in the pavilion room. In addition to giving a few yuan per month (only about 100 yuan in a year), he never provided any clothing. But for Ms. Lu, he bought a car and drove around in social situations every day. The plaintiff's clothes were gorgeous, like a noble woman. In October of last year, Ms. Lu died of measles. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had poisoned her to death, adding to the animosity. Whenever the plaintiff returned to her mother's house for something, the servant was ordered to close the door and refuse entry. One day, she entrusted a relative to say that the entire rented house would be sold, ordering the plaintiff to find another house, otherwise, she would be expelled as easily as picking up a snail with two fingers. Another day, she went to Dong Kang's place and said that she wanted to divorce the plaintiff. After Dong Kang advised him sternly, he left without success. On November 27, the defendant actually filed a lawsuit in the public court, claiming that the plaintiff had suffered from lung disease before the marriage, requesting a divorce and demanding compensation for wedding expenses of 3,000 yuan. After several hearings, Chief Gong ordered mediation, but the defendant was not sincere. He recruited women to his residence every day, and the family order was unspeakable. In January of this year, Fan Songji volunteered to mediate and said that the defendant had fallen in love with other women, and the divorce must be achieved. He instructed the plaintiff to reluctantly agree to his request, and in the future, when he realized it, he might be able to reunite. Fan Songji stipulated several conditions. On the evening of February 3, Fan Songji invited the plaintiff to a room in the New World Hotel to discuss the matter. The plaintiff thought it was a preliminary consultation and went with Dong Kang's concubine, Ms. Chi. The defendant was also in the next room and had invited lawyer Zhan Jifeng to the scene to prove it, ordering the plaintiff to sign the divorce agreement immediately. The plaintiff believed that the conditions were not appropriate and firmly refused to agree. She stayed until 1:30 in the evening before returning. The next day, the public court opened the trial. The defendant cited the old rules of the public court and advocated an indefinite postponement. Chief Gong ordered a week to resolve the matter in court. The plaintiff was ashamed to be a divorced woman and also filed a request for a verdict. When the deadline was reached, she entrusted lawyer Sheng Shengxi to appear in court, knowing that Chief Gong had agreed to the defendant's request to suspend the case. Recently, the defendant is willing to go to Hong Kong to find a livelihood, claiming that he will sell the residence in Xifei Lane in the French Concession, showing that the plaintiff is willing to return to nothing. The plaintiff heard the news that some clothing and other items had not been taken out, so Dong Banggan went to take them. The defendant happened to be in his law firm and was severely reprimanded by the servant's phone call, claiming that whoever took one item would be sent to the court as a robber for investigation. The plaintiff, terrified by his power, stopped immediately. The defendant rushed home and informed the French police, willing to arrest the plaintiff. By the time the plaintiff had left. This is the true situation of the plaintiff's marriage by fraud and the brutal treatment and recent abandonment by the defendant. I have been self-conscious of the fact that the plaintiff was born in a famous family,拘于礼教, 贻误至今 (I can't translate this well, and I'm not adding comments). If the defendant regarded Ms. Lu as the first wife, when the plaintiff declared the termination of the marriage contract, he should not have used fraudulent means to conclude this invalid marriage. He confirmed the plaintiff's identity, and he should not have dismissed the repeated letters and declared Ms. Lu as the first wife. Within the statute of limitations for criminal liability, the relatives of both parties repeatedly advised him to file a criminal lawsuit. The plaintiff, believing in the righteousness of a single marriage, could not bear to put the defendant in prison. Now that Ms. Lu has died, the defendant has abandoned the plaintiff in the name of lung disease. People are so ungrateful. The plaintiff, being Dong's wife, though her youth has been sacrificed, who should be responsible for her support in the remaining years? Dong's daughter, Yan Sheng, is also Dong's descendant, and who should educate her in her childhood? All these kinds of problems belong to common legal sense. The defendant has been practicing law for many years, so he cannot disclaim that he does not know. The law is to guide the people. No matter what class, they are all subject to it. He is not allowed to have special powers and claim to be beyond his due. The plaintiff is weak and almost has no way to appeal. Because I thought that the court was composed of Chinese law, compared with the foreign trial, it was different from the clouds. For this reason, I will list the general outline, begging to give the day to collect human evidence, and judge the identity and support matters according to law, which is convenient for virtue. In addition, this case has been involved in litigation for several months. With the stubbornness of the defendant, there is no possibility of mediation. Please omit the procedures and directly pay for the trial to avoid delay. Combined statement, Shanghai Special District Court,</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper's Sichuan Border Photography Reporters Wang Xiaoting and Liu Shuofu Will Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Last year, this newspaper specially dispatched photography reporters Wang Xiaoting and Liu Shuofu to accompany Mr. Smith of the Chicago Museum of Natural History in the United States on a biological collection trip to Sichuan. After leaving Shanghai in November, they passed through Chongqing, Xufu, Jiading, and Yazhou, and photographed many scenery scenes in Sichuan along the way, and a small part has been published in this newspaper's pictorial. Later, Wang and Liu, because the collection group's scope was not wide, immediately set off separately, traveling to the Qiangyi-Tibetan tribes on the northwestern border of Sichuan, passing through Dajinchuan, Xiaojinchuan, Hou Chuan, Weizhou, Lifean, Zagu Brain, Daweijia, Jinshan, Maogong, Yutong, Muping, and other places in Dajianlu. They took many unique photos of various high-altitude snow scenes, Tibetan Yi village houses, customs, and clothing, and collected valuable and interesting textual materials from each place. There are true situations that are different from the records of various families. At the same time, after the problem of the Kangzang dispute broke out, the real situation inside was far from what was reported outside, and many photos of our army and the Tibetan army fighting were taken, which are extremely valuable for proving the Kangzang incident. Recently, this newspaper received letters from the two gentlemen, saying that they will meet in Jiading soon and then return east, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month. Mr. Wang also went to Mount Gongga (the second highest peak in the world, about 26,000 feet above sea level, to take pictures, which is also rare outside. In the future, it will be published successively in this newspaper's pictorial, and texts will be published in this newspaper.</p>
<h3>A Girl's Head Cut Off By Streetcar</h3>
<p>The Girl Xu Da-Nian Died A Pitiable Death</p>
<p>Yesterday's report described a girl riding in a trolley car, traveling near the vegetable market on Avenue Edward VII, when she leaned her head out of the window and struck an electric pole along the road, causing her head to break and bleed, resulting in death. It is now known that the deceased was named Xu Da-Nian and was only ten years old. She was the daughter of Xu Yufang of Zhenjiang. The trolley car she was riding was number 349 on Route 16. Her body was ordered to be carried into the Filun Road Examination Office by the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, all the witnesses were summoned to the office. At 10:00 AM, the Special District Court Prosecutor's Office appointed Prosecutor Guo Huaipu to come to the office to investigate. He ascended to the seat of public office and questioned the driver of the car, Li Xueren, who said that because the place where the accident occurred was under construction, the trolley car was driving along the side of the road and moving very slowly. Unexpectedly, the girl suddenly leaned her head out of the window, causing the disaster. Mr. Miller, a Westerner from the trolley car company, also submitted a statement, saying that all trolley cars have rules posted inside warning passengers not to lean their heads out of the window while the trolley car is moving, which is also stated in the rules. Although women and children may not know everything, fathers and elder brothers should also explain it in detail on weekdays so that such a tragedy does not happen. Finally, the father of the deceased requested that the company be ordered to provide compensation for the funeral. Prosecutor Guo then instructed the Westerner to return to the company to negotiate and provide some compensation, and instructed Xu Yufang to collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Li Zongkan's Case: Kidnappers Sentenced to Five Years</h3>
<p>Li Zongkan, the nephew of Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee residing at No. 584 Father Laro, French Concession, was an engineer at the Dafang Construction Company. A few days ago, he went out from home and took his own car to go to the company to work. Unexpectedly, as soon as he got into the car, six kidnappers rushed up, trying to kidnap him. Fortunately, Li opened the car door and escaped. Special detectives and supervisors from the French Police Department, including Jin Jiulin, chief detective Li Yaolong, deputy detectives Qian Yumin and Zhang Ziying, and Mao Jingen, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, capturing one kidnapper, Wang Afu, and finding a handgun on his person, and taking him to the police station for investigation. The police sent Wang to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff first complained about the kidnapping. When asked, Wang Afu confessed that he was from Tongzhou and had been a vendor. He was invited by Lu Haitao, whom he had known for a long time, to kidnap the plaintiff, which was true. He also hired a lawyer to represent him in everything. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Wang Afu to five years in Western prison and deportation, and sent him to the inland court for investigation. The handgun was confiscated.</p>

<p>Rescheduled for Retrial in Two Weeks</p>
<p>The case of Ye Zhongfang being accused by Chen Yan, the wife of the late lawyer Chen Zhigang, of seducing her daughter Chen Xiuzhen, was continued by the Special District Court, because the police at the Lukiawan Police Station in the French Concession had to investigate the plaintiff's report of her daughter's abduction in the past, so the case was postponed. Yesterday afternoon, the date of the continued hearing was reached, and both parties filed the case on time, but the Lukiawan Police Station had not yet replied with a clear document to the court and could not proceed with the trial. The defendant's lawyer said that mediation has made progress and requested a rescheduling of two weeks to continue the mediation outside the court. At that time, the plaintiff's side did not object, so Judge Xiao Xieffun approved the defendant's request and ordered a retrial in two weeks.</p>

<h3>Business Report of the Bank of China for the 19th Year of the Republic of China (Continued)</h3>
<p>(International Trade in the 19th Year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>International trade in the 19th year of the Republic of China suffered declines in silver prices, frequent internal wars, harassment by bandits and communists, and a sluggish world market. Although there was no major change in value, the quantity inevitably decreased sharply. According to the customs, the total import and export volume for the year was 2,204,599,336 customs taels (excluding gold and silver). Compared with the total import and export volume of 2,281,466,039 taels in the 18th year, it decreased by 76,866,703 taels, or 3.3 percent. However, compared with the 17th year, there was still an increase of about 17 million taels. The net import value for the year was 1,309,755,742 taels, an increase of 43,976,921 taels over the net import value in the 18th year, or 3.4 percent. The net export value was 894,843,594 taels, a decrease of 220,843,624 taels compared to the net export value in the 18th year, or 11.9 percent. The excess of imports over exports increased from 250,091,603 taels in the 18th year to 414,912,148 taels, a huge number unprecedented. What is even more noteworthy is that although the total import and export volume in the 19th year was only slightly lower than that in the 18th year, this is only in terms of the silver value. If calculated in terms of gold prices, the difference is quite large. The average conversion rate of the customs tael in the 18th year was 2 shillings 7 and 13/16 pence, so the imported goods that year were worth £167,781,617 in British gold. The average conversion rate of the customs tael in the 19th year was 1 shilling 10 and 11/16 pence, so the imported goods that year were only worth £123,810,119 in British gold, a decrease of £43,971,498, or 26 percent. This is the decrease in quantity, which is still slightly better than the 30 percent decrease in imports from Japan. As for the import and export status of various commercial ports, the customs offices in Dalian, Andong, Tianjin, Yantai, Hankou, Guangdong, and Kowloon all saw declines in the 19th year. Shanghai, Shantou, Qingdao, and Harbin all increased. Shanghai alone accounted for 51 percent of import trade and 35 percent of export trade. Dalian ranked second, accounting for 14.4 percent of the total trade. Tianjin ranked third, accounting for 8.2 percent of the total trade. Below this are Guangdong, Qingdao, Harbin, Andong, Shantou, Hankou, and Kowloon in that order. Among the importing countries, Japan ranked first, followed by the United States. India jumped to third place due to the increase in cotton imports. The United Kingdom dropped from third to fourth place. Germany's import volume still cannot compete with Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom, but it increased by 2 million customs taels compared to the 18th year and nearly doubled compared to before the European War. The country of origin of imports and the value of imported goods are shown below: Importing Country Value of Imported Goods (Customs Taels) Percentage</p>
<p>18th Year 19th Year 18th Year 19th Year</p>
<p>Japan 323,141,660 327,164,867 25.22% 24.63%</p>
<p>United States 230,843,677 232,277,286 18.01% 17.49%</p>
<p>India 54,479,464 132,168,471 4.25% 9.95%</p>
<p>United Kingdom 119,148,969 108,257,932 9.3% 8.15%</p>
<p>Germany 67,075,824 69,105,357 5.23% 5.20%</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 55,998,356 48,360,659 4.37% 3.64%</p>
<p>Belgium 25,773,388 27,456,827 2.01% 2.47%</p>
<p>France 18,185,138 16,986,885 1.42% 1.28%</p>
<p>Canada 38,476,967 13,517,476 30.18% 27.59%</p>
<p>Hong Kong 214,481,099 28,369,933 30.18% 27.59%</p>
<p>Other Countries 133,716,749 134,566,293 30.18% 27.59%</p>
<p>Total 1,281,321,291 1,328,231,986 10.00% 100.00%</p>
<p>Among the imported goods, those that decreased were cotton textiles, from 174,126,776 customs taels in the 18th year to 149,888,808 taels in the 19th year, wool textiles from 44,723,417 taels to 24,804,424 taels, and sugar from 98,765,446 taels to 86,390,806 taels. Those that increased were cotton, from 91,123,857 taels to 132,265,669 taels, machinery from 29,886,503 taels to 44,288,207 taels, and chemicals from 34,254,517 taels to 46,904,944 taels. As for food, wheat imports in the 19th year were 2,762,240 dan, a decrease of 2,901,617 dan compared to the 5,663,857 dan in the previous year. Flour imports were 5,188,243 dan, a decrease of 6,747,205 dan compared to the 11,935,448 dan in the previous year. However, rice imports increased to 19,892,784 dan, an increase of 9,068,719 dan compared to the 10,824,066 dan in the previous year. In total, the total value of food imports was approximately 189,262,340 taels, equivalent to approximately 283,893,510 silver dollars, an increase of 21,803,830 taels, equivalent to 32,705,745 silver dollars, compared to the total value of food imports in the previous year of 167,410 taels, equivalent to 251,187,760 silver dollars. China, a country based on agriculture, imports so much food, which is a matter of life and death for the Chinese people. The report for the 18th year already emphasized this three times, but the 19th year has only increased, which is truly a cause for long sighs. The export trade in the 19th year was greatly reduced due to the impact of the sluggish world market, decreasing from 1,015,687,318 customs taels in the 18th year to 894,843,594 taels. The main goods with reduced sales were raw silk, soybeans, tung oil, tea, cotton, leather, feathers, and wool. The export of peanuts and peanut oil increased dramatically. Eggs and egg products were also able to maintain their original state. The country of origin of exports and the value of exported goods are shown below:</p>

<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>—Hai Ke</p>
<p>The famous Princeton University in the United States conducted zoological experiments. They removed a heart from a turtle and used scientific methods to keep it beating for up to thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>Sea dogs have very poor eyesight out of the water and can barely see anything. Therefore, European and American sea dog skin traders often wait for them to come ashore to play before capturing them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>There are a total of 50,771 registered blind people in the United Kingdom, of whom 36,485 are unemployed. It can be seen that it is extremely difficult for blind people to find employment.</p>
<p>An American beauty expert says that if women can smile often, it can make their faces look delicate and young. If they constantly give cold faces to others, the lower jaw is prone to overlapping (i.e., what is commonly called a double chin).</p>
<p>The clock face on the Royal Liver Building in Liverpool, England, is thirty feet in diameter. It is the largest clock face of all clocks in the country.</p>

<h3>Gleanings from the National Conference</h3>
<p>—Jie Fei</p>
<p>The National Conference was held on May 5th amidst drizzle and was closed on May 17th under the blue sky and white sun. As Mr. Hu Shuhua said, "The National Conference is about to rain. This is the spirit of the Premier in heaven, instructing us to share the same boat in this stormy situation… Finally, I remember a German saying: 'After the rain, there will be clear weather.' It usually encourages people to strive for a bright and righteous path from hardship. I believe that all the storms after the National Conference have passed, and we will get a truly blue sky and white sun. I would like to use this meaning to wish the National Conference success." From the opening to the closing, a total of thirteen days passed. Since I was nearby, I had the opportunity to admire it from time to time. Now I record its trivial details to fill this talk.</p>
<p>The Capital on This Day: Since the opening of the National Conference, the streets of the capital have been completely renewed. South of Chengxian Street, memorial archways can be seen along the road. In the evening, colorful electric lights are lit up. The people of the capital are wearing their spring clothes for the first time, giving a sense of everyone being out on the streets. At the same time, all newspapers increased the printing of special issues of the National Conference. The Capital Grand Theatre specially screened "The National Soul" on the opening day, and each time it was sold out. This is enough to prove a glimpse of the excitement and joy of the people of the capital on this day.</p>
<p>Grand Exhibition: Various domestic exhibitions were held in the capital before and after the opening of the National Conference, such as the Jiangsu Special Products Exhibition, the Revolutionary History Exhibition, the Health Exhibition, the Central University Seventeenth Grade Art Exhibition, the Beijing Municipal Art Exhibition, and the Hangzhou Art College Exhibition. They sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. The people of the capital have been fortunate to feast their eyes in recent days.</p>
<p>Auto Assembly: On the days of the opening and closing ceremonies, cars gathered like ants. Even the spacious plaza of Central University was almost useless. Every day when the meeting was held, cars went in and out at 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM. Cars ran tail to tail on Chengxian Street, sometimes for an hour without stopping. At first, when requesting a car number at the meeting place, the police would shout the number through a megaphone, but it took a long time. Later, because the scope was too wide and the sound did not reach, areas were designated. Representatives lived in certain dormitory numbers, and cars were parked in the area of ​​those numbers. This measure greatly benefited the police.</p>
<p>Plane Tree Spring Sorrow: When expanding the Dazhong Road of Central University, the French plane trees planted on both sides for the past five or six years had trunks as thick as a person's waist and roots more than ten feet long. Cranes were used to move them outward. It took dozens of people an hour to complete the work for each tree. It is said that the transplantation cost for each tree was four yuan and fifty cents.</p>
<p>Evening Scene of the Venue: From Chengxian Street to the venue, there are three pine and cypress memorial archways, all of which are tall and solemn, especially the memorial archway in front of the main gate. It is in the form of an ancient building with three holes underneath. It is more than ten feet high, with flying eaves overlapping each other, capturing the beauty of ancient Chinese architecture, and its meaning is very profound. Every time the lights are lit, the electric lights compete to shine, and many tourists look from afar. The Great Auditorium is especially brilliant in the evening. Thousands of lights are connected together, illuminating the distant forest and flowers. There is a view of spring light like the sea. Its magnificent and towering, occasionally walking under the pillars, makes one feel like a wriggling insect. The thought of reverence is often heartfelt.</p>
<h3>Mr. Fan Shutong Came to Shanghai from Shashi to Visit Old Friends, and Upon Reading the Great Collection, Inscribed Two Quatrains to Present</h3>
<p>—Cheng Yansheng</p>
<p>His style is as straightforward as Chen Wuyi, and his life is somewhat similar to Yuan Yuzhi. His bitter words and long chants are due to his ultimate nature, and he lies exhausted in Shashi, fearing to be known.</p>
<p>His lofty footprints come from far away, the Yangtze and Han rivers last forever. In the fading spring, wind and rain fall upon the flowers. There are few remaining loyal subjects on the sea, and the sick and old man can be visited. (Referring to the two gentlemen, Wang Bingshan and Zhu Qiangcun)</p>
<h3>Accompanying the Two Dukes, Ren and Wen, to Visit the Wu Zhuang Shrine in Gyeongseong, Korea</h3>
<p>—Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>The general's great achievements are inscribed in the green history, leaving behind the incense of sacrifice in the three Hans. Ten thousand cherry blossoms bloom near the three-foot tablet. I gaze upon the general's temple and my clothes are stained with tears.</p>
<p>His demeanor is no different from Yang Shuzi, and his meritorious name does not yield to Li Rusong. Who can take on the role of the mainstay in the middle of the stream today? The difficulties of the country make me miss the general even more.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Royal Palace in Gyeongseong, Korea</h3>
<p>—Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>I cannot bear to recall the events of the Tianbao era. The white-haired old men speak of the vicissitudes of life. The ancient palace and secret garden are still unharmed today. The high Northern Han Mountain leans against the setting sun.</p>
<h3>Another Dream</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>I was a callow youth, following my late father in exile to the Xueping area within Xiangtan County city in Hunan. Xueping was an open space in front of the school palace, directly abutting the southern city wall. Its gate was named Guānxiāng. Xiangtan's commerce was historically prosperous; the streets and markets were collectively known as "Zǒng." Outside Guānxiāng Gate was the Jiǔ Zǒng, extending upstream to the Shíbā Zǒng, a length of perhaps twenty miles, with the Shíwǔ and Liù Zǒng areas especially known as a gathering place for elites. On the night of the twelfth day of the seventh month in the Gēngyín year of the Guangxu reign, I had a dream. I dreamt that the Shíwǔ and Liù Zǒng area was careless, with red light reaching the sky. From afar, I heard the clamor of voices, interspersed with a sound like a string of firecrackers. Waking, I remembered it. Local Xiangtan custom forbade speaking of dreams in the morning. After breakfast, I related it. My late father said, "You must have dreamt what you were thinking. At the time, it was the Zhongyuan Festival. Xiangtan customs involved ancestral sacrifices, with households burning paper money, all in Xueping. Dozens or hundreds of such events occur daily, their light blazing. You probably had a dream based on these impressions." This theory seemed highly plausible. Two days later, on the fourteenth, at dusk, I heard alarm gongs clang loudly outside the city. Quickly, I rushed into the city. Soon, water dragons (fire engines) sped past. Civil and military officials and their retinues followed, shouting. After supper, my late father led my brothers and I up to the Guānxiāng Gate tower to observe. As I ascended the city wall and gazed out, I immediately recalled my dream. The fire was indeed raging in the Shíwǔ and Liù Zǒng area. The red light reaching the sky, the clamor of voices mixed with the sound of firecrackers – all matched the dream scene exactly. The sound of firecrackers, I later learned, came from the bamboo shops on River Street, where bamboo poles were made. My late father was also astonished by the strange dream, saying that if I hadn't predicted it beforehand, people would have suspected I was talking nonsense. Dreams are easily forgotten. This dream, because of this incident, remained vividly in my memory. I often asked people about it, but none could explain it. After the founding of the Republic, I served in the Zhejiang Governor's Secretariat, and I told my colleague Ding Guiqiao about it. Guiqiao, a devout Buddhist, showed me the *Notes from the Pingdeng Pavilion* by Di Chuqing. In one entry, the owner kept a goose, and dreamt that the goose was killed by a dog. The next day, the dog indeed killed the goose. The main explanation was that all future events are stored in a person's eighth consciousness field, occasionally appearing in dreams. I am a dull and ignorant person and do not understand this at all. Furthermore, the goose and the dog were both domestic animals, connected to the owner. I, however, am like drifting duckweed, having no connection to Xiangtan at all. That county is a large one, with a population of no less than a million, yet the premonition appeared to a young man with absolutely no connection to it. Why is this? According to the Buddhist teachings of Ding and Di, everything in the world, small as a goose's death or large as a fire, is predetermined. Is there, then, a predetermined fate for even the smallest things? Speaking of myself, I have strived for fame and fortune for decades. Many future good and bad fortunes should be stored in my eighth consciousness. Why is it that I never see them in my dreams, but instead dream of a fire with which I have no connection? I sincerely hope that Ding and Di can offer me an explanation, and that philosophers and spiritualists can enlighten me.</p>
<p>Brief News. The Paris Grand Theater, starting this Thursday, will screen a major social warning film titled "Stealing Jade and Savoring Fragrance." Not only are the plot and performances excellent, but its message is especially pertinent to modern society, provoking deep thought. Modern young men and women often conflate spiritual love with sexual desire, leading to various tragedies. The protagonist of this film also fails to recognize this, resulting in the woman becoming secretly pregnant. Rumors fly, and gossip abounds. The woman's father hears of it and repeatedly seeks to kill her. Fortunately, the man's love is as firm as iron, and they eventually become a couple. However, the woman is already worn down and haggard. There is also an interlude that serves as a warning. At the time, there is another cohabiting man, a master of "stealing jade and savoring fragrance," who has always coveted the woman. When the woman's secret is revealed, many suspect him to be the culprit. The rumor spreads to his lover, who, overwhelmed with grief and anger, jumps out of a window and commits suicide. What thoughts will the gossipy tongues of the world have after watching this? (Sheng Pu)</p>

<h3>Travelogue of the Yellow Sea (9)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>On the morning of April 2nd, I traveled to Korea and arrived in Seoul in the evening.</p>
<p>This is my third trip to Korea. I have many Korean and Japanese friends. Three years ago, I wrote a book titled "Korea." The authorities, knowing that I pay attention to Korean affairs, had the Foreign Affairs Section of the Governor-General's Office guide me to observe educational and cultural institutions and hosted a banquet for me at the Myeongwol Gak. Amid the singing and dancing, a great deal of sorrow naturally arose.</p>
<p>Inscription at Myeongwol Gak</p>
<p>Seoul in the third month, like a spring bath.</p>
<p>The stories from this pavilion still warrant tears.</p>
<p>A telephone then betrayed the names of heroes.</p>
<p>Tonight, beautiful women wear Five Clouds robes.</p>
<p>You rise to dance.</p>
<p>I compose a song.</p>
<p>The song complete, the moonlight is white across the sky,</p>
<p>Illuminating the coming and going waves of the Han River. (In 1919, during the Korean Independence Declaration, patriots gathered at Myeongwol Gak. When the police arrived, they reported their names to the police station by telephone and were all arrested.)</p>
<p>A courtesan named Coral Bead insisted that I write a poem, so I wrote a quatrain:</p>
<p>Red are the coral, white are the pearls.</p>
<p>What is the feeling between beautiful women facing each other?</p>
<p>If we were to meet a bewhiskered stranger from overseas,</p>
<p>He would recognize that heroes are not alone.</p>
<p>Since 1919, Japan's policy toward Korea has been to abolish all unequal treatment between Japan and Korea, and this policy is still being implemented. This is the effect of the two bombs that year. However, equality between Japan and Korea is limited to the surface. In essence, they implement two major policies: (1) Immigration. As mentioned earlier, two million Koreans are moved into South Manchuria to be pioneers in acquiring commercial lease rights. (2) Assimilation. They vigorously promote marriage between Japanese and Koreans. The government awards each such couple one hundred gold coins. However, out of the entire Korean population of nineteen million, there are only four hundred and fifty such couples. I asked Koreans if they would like to marry Japanese. The answer was: "Which man wants a Japanese woman? Which woman is willing to marry a Japanese man?"</p>
<p>Japan is extremely intent on appeasing the Korean people and provoking them to hate our people. Their devious intentions were laid bare long ago in the chapter on Korean immigration incentives and protection policies in the Tanaka Memorial. It states, "If the number of Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia exceeds 2.5 million, then in the event of an incident, we can use the Korean people as atoms for military activities. However, our country can utilize the Koreans, but we must guard against the Chinese government utilizing the Koreans to control us." For this reason, they are doing their best to alienate Korean feelings toward us.</p>

<h3>The Twists and Turns of the Hawthorne Detective Case (20)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>That afternoon, I did not participate in what Hawthorne said he had to do. He only said that there were several leads that needed to be pursued urgently. However, because my Peiqin was not yet fully recovered, he did not let me go with him, only telling me to go home and wait for news. By the evening of that day, Hawthorne made a phone call, telling me that he was seventy or eighty percent certain about the whereabouts of that young man, and he expected to find out completely soon. I thought to myself that seventy or eighty percent certainty was not far from the complete result, and it could not be considered unwelcome news. As for how Hawthorne achieved seventy or eighty percent certainty, I had no other thoughts besides surprise and admiration. I patiently waited another day. By three or four o'clock the next afternoon, Hawthorne suddenly came to my residence in person. He claimed to be visiting Peiqin's illness. In fact, he brought three pieces of delightful news to me. However, he did not announce this news immediately. It was not until he bid me farewell and I sent him outside the door that he quietly told me. He whispered, "Your experience that night, I assume you concealed it from your wife." I nodded. Hawthorne smiled and said, "Fortunately, I knew better than to reveal it to her face." I said, "But haven't you completely found out the traces of this person?" Hawthorne seemed to imitate my actions, nodding in the same way. I quickly asked, "Who is this person? What kind of character is he?" Hawthorne said, "This person has a big background. His surname is Che and his given name is Shijie. He lives at No. 718 Datong Road. He used to work in the military, so he knew Gao Peixian. Now he is working as a clerk for Lawyer Wen. That Lawyer Wen is still his uncle." I said, "It can't be said to be such a big deal for this person to be a lawyer's clerk." Hawthorne said, "Lawyer Wen's given name is Zhang. Have you heard of him?" Only then did I know that this person specializes in handling cases of adultery and theft, and has some "wicked reputation" in society. He is definitely not a good person to provoke. Before I could answer, Hawthorne continued, "This person makes a living from the law. Since this matter has taken a turn, and he is using indirect means to trick us without leaving any traces, there is really no legal action that can be taken against him. Therefore, we must also think of a roundabout way to retaliate." I hurriedly asked again, "So, how to do it in a roundabout way? Do you already have a plan in mind?" Hawthorne shook his head and said, "Not yet. This can only patiently wait for an opportunity. Acting rashly will only ruin things."</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold's Rising Trend Remains Unabated</h3>
<p>Weak in the Morning, Flourishing in the Afternoon, Up Three Taels and More. Yesterday, the 20th, the gold market fluctuated greatly, weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, with a total difference of thirteen taels throughout the day. In the end, it rose slightly by three taels. Sentiment within the industry was uncertain, but there were many buyers. Although the silver market fell by a lot, this was because overseas buyers seemed strong. As a result, the price of gold, even after falling, broke the 770 taels level. It seems that both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates are tight and have been reduced by one notch. Buyers in the market began to be active. Furthermore, because the British exchange rate, etc., was reduced for the second time, the market showed another peak, soaring by more than ten taels, even exceeding the 80 taels level.

Until about 3:30 PM, it was only 77.1 taels, but there was an occasional rise or fall of one tael in between. Not long after, one tael was added, to 8.34 taels.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Trends Differently</h3>
<p>Market Overview. Yesterday's market for silver dollars trended upward due to buying, and sentiment rose again. The situation was suddenly smart, but several hundred thousand in cocoon funds were also installed. As for the silver loan situation, it remained as loose and stagnant as before. However, as yesterday was the 20th pay period, the financial institutions' various collections and remittances were tighter, so the collection and remittance of public bills increased sharply. In addition, the market conditions for subsidiary coins also increased slightly, and the copper dollar also contracted by several thousand yuan. In summary, the current market is more idle than ever, and there is probably no great hope of improvement.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices. The interest rate for "silver dollars" in the morning market increased by half a cent due to external buying, to 7 coins 2 points 9 cents 2 haos 5. The noon market was at the same price. As for whether there will be a continued rise today, it is difficult to determine in the current turbulent market.

The market for drawing heads and adding water was two or three points.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions. The Jiangnan small silver dollar was the same in the morning and noon markets at 6 coins 5 points 4 cents, an improvement of 2 cents from the previous day. 6,000 angles were transacted in the early market and 2,500 angles in the noon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 6 coins 4 points 5 cents 8 haos 7 hus and half in the morning market and 6 coins 4 points 6 cents 2 haos and a half in the noon market. 115,000 angles were transacted in the early market and 45,000 angles in the noon market. The copper dollar suddenly contracted by 3,000 yuan for no reason, with 378,000 yuan being transacted in a limited market, with only 28,000+ yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Entries and Exits. The news of the "silver funds" remitted by banks yesterday was similar to usual, but slightly busier. Chinese merchants remitted 2,230,000, foreign merchants remitted 1,560,000, special funds remitted 2,000,000+, and various goods exchange taxes and misc. funds remitted 8,780,000, with 1,200,000 withdrawn from the warehouse.

The off-market banknote early market was 180,000 and the noon market was 85,000. Bank transactions had an early market intermarket of 550,000 and a noon market of 600,000.

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rebounded by About One Yuan</h3>

Transactions between the two markets totaled more than 10 million yuan, but the afternoon market was strong, with more than 14 million yuan being offered. The pre-market market was tired and the changes were minimal. The post-market rose quite strongly, and the market started to ease slightly after the close. Compared to the previous day, only 96 was slightly better by two cents, and the entire 6 rose by 67 cents. The other Xian rose by about 1 yuan. Statistics show that the total volume of futures transactions for the whole day reached 24,410,000, and the spot market transactions totaled 37,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market – Yarn Market Shows Signs of Progress</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, with a favorable situation. This is mainly due to recent sales of spot yarn being reasonably good, while the price of silk has fallen and the price of gold has risen. Although foreign cotton yarn has declined, the calculated price for three grades of yarn must be around 214 or 215 taels of silver. Transportation to the northern regions is difficult, but transactions in Shanghai continue uninterrupted. Therefore, considering the overall situation, standard yarn at 158 or 159 taels has a chance of stabilizing. However, rumors about the current situation persist, and speculators are selling off, causing the market to fluctuate wildly. Yesterday, a major player shorted 4,000 to 5,000 bales, tightening the market and pushing prices past the 160 tael mark. However, most believe the political situation is chaotic and are still selling short, it is said.</p>
<p>Human Standard Yarn Market Rises Sharply – The Human Standard yarn market opened strong this morning due to the large number of short positions held by Jia Li on the 12th. Therefore, the prices for all months did not fall, with minor drops in the second and third positions. The market rebounded at closing, resulting in a slight decrease of 5 cent for near months and an increase of 3 to 5 cent for distant months. In the afternoon, with a relatively dry market, the atmosphere suddenly became lively, with each position rising by 1.235 taels. The total transaction volume was 25,250 bales, with Yi Yu selling 1,350 bales, Chang Feng 1,700 bales, Geng Feng 1,250 bales, Gong Tai 750 bales, and Ji Feng 850 bales. Shen Xin bought 4,600 bales, Rong Xing 800 bales, and Fu He 950 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Recovers in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. The May futures for American cotton broke the 9-cent mark, a rare occurrence, causing widespread panic. The decline in standard cotton became more severe. Later, with the large decrease in the price of silver and the daily increase in the price of gold, the market reversed. However, some still sold short. In the afternoon, following the gold market, prices rose by 3 to 4 cent. Japanese traders sold off this month's positions and rolled them into October, it is said.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Cotton Market Remains Stable – The Hankou Standard cotton market opened this morning, falling sharply with American cotton. Later, it rebounded due to short covering, resulting in a decrease of 1.5 to 3 cent. In the afternoon, prices rose by 2, 3, or 4 cent. The total transaction volume was 85,400 dan.

<h3>Food – Ke Xian Rice Sales Active, Price Increases Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market situation was still very good due to competition among local merchants, and prices jumped slightly. This is because current inventories are low. Once local merchants compete, cargo owners tend to hoard, and if local appetites remain strong in the future, the situation of inventory depletion will worsen, and prices will continue to improve. Yesterday, the overall market opened with 1,500 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, priced at 11.40 to 11.10 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day. In addition, 300 bags of newly arrived Wuhu machine-milled Xian rice were priced at 10.08 to 10.03 yuan. Other goods were scarce and did not open for trading.</p>
<h3>Forward Foreign Rice Rises Steadily</h3>
<p>1,500 Tons Newly Traded</p>
<p>The foreign rice market has been quite lively recently. Shanghai merchants and foreign firms have been sending telegrams continuously, and prices have followed the rise in Shanghai Du Ke rice. Moreover, the high price of gold has made the combined price more expensive. Yesterday, Mitsui sold 500 tons of June Min Dang rice at 5.55 taels, an increase of 1.5 cent from the previous opening price. In addition, 1,000 tons of Number One Saigon rice for July delivery were priced at 5.75 taels, which is more than 2 cent higher in terms of combined value.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Fluctuates Several Times</h3>
<p>Resulting in Only a Slight Decrease</p>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market opened in the morning, and prices for all months showed an upward trend again. With the quoted price of foreign wheat returning to a high of 2 to 3 cent, and the weather still cloudy and rainy, the surrounding environment became increasingly unfavorable. Therefore, after the opening price, due to the enthusiasm of the people, the market jumped violently again. This month's price reached a high of 4.30 taels, June reached 2.5 cent, July reached 2.2 cent, August reached 2.3 cent, and October reached 2.8 cent, a sharp increase of 4, 5, 6, or 7 cent compared to the previous day's closing price. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, with the weather clearing up, and the rumor spreading that factories had ordered 30,000 tons of foreign wheat, and foreign merchants' sales efforts remained active, people's hearts had already become weak. The general expectation was that prices would fall, so selling increased, and the market plummeted. However, compared to the previous day's closing price, the drop was not much. As a result, this month decreased slightly by 7 cent, June and July decreased slightly by 2 cent, August and September decreased slightly by 1 cent, and October decreased slightly by 3 cent, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Advances and Retreats Quickly</h3>
<p>The Final Decrease Was Slight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and prices for all months remained lively. With the weather cloudy and rainy, and the quoted price of foreign wheat higher, speculators were very active. May, June, and July all broke through the 1 cent mark, with an average increase of 1 to 2 cent. However, actual sales merchants were unmoved and instead sold off, so the upward trend was not strong. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, due to the weather conditions, people's enthusiasm had waned. In addition, the wheat market had plummeted, and the bulls were also shaken. The selling pressure for all months was at its peak for a time. However, the price increases in recent days had been so rapid that the subsequent decline felt insignificant. As a result, this month was unchanged, June and July decreased slightly by 5 li, August decreased slightly by 2.5 li, September was unchanged, and October decreased slightly by 5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea – High-Quality Early Cocoons in Chang'an Surge</h3>
<p>Poor Cocoon Quality in Da Dian, Premium Cocoons Open at 50 Yuan</p>
<p>In the towns and villages near Chang'an, the early silkworm crops have all failed this year. The late crops have also been severely damaged by the cold and rainy weather during the peak leaf-eating period. The overall harvest of new cocoons is only 20% of a normal year, and the quality is inferior. Very few high-quality cocoons have arrived on the market. Only seven or eight cocoon shops have opened, with limited purchasing capacity. Each shop is competing to offer high prices for premium cocoons. Yesterday, improved-breed cocoons opened at 50.25 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Factory Raw Silk Prices Struggle to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in Shanghai remained sluggish. Despite the frequent declines in the exchange rate, and the slightly higher prices telegraphed by overseas factories, the combined exchange rate made it difficult for prices to rise. Factories were less willing to sell. Yesterday, Mitsui purchased 10 bales of Shanghai white factory raw silk, Gan Li purchased 20 bales of Sichuan yellow factory raw silk, and Gao Pei purchased 8 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remained low, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Tea Opening Prices in Wunan Await</h3>
<p>New tea from Wuyi's southern villages is always picked and processed earlier than elsewhere. Since most mountain households are engaged in farming, they are busy planting rice at this time. They will harvest tea before the Start of Summer. Last year, due to the high prices in the northern mountain areas, tea merchants abandoned the nearby southern areas and headed north to purchase tea. Therefore, new tea from various villages in the southern area was quickly sold out last year, and prices were high. This year, although mountain households have already finished picking and are waiting to sell, tea merchants believe that the quality of tea in the southern route is inferior, and that the price of tea in the northern villages will not be as high as last year. They do not want to rush into buying and intend to wait and see how the new tea from the northern villages opens before setting prices, it is said.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea Trend Downward Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign firms tea market, British firms showed strong interest in red teas from Qimen and Fuliang, and a total of 2,125 boxes were traded throughout the city. Trade was not lonely, but the prices offered by experts for medium and low-grade red teas were harsh, and the market fell by 30 to 40 taels. Local merchants of Zhenmei green tea, seeing that tea from other routes would soon arrive in Shanghai, feared that the market would be difficult to hold, and were willing to sell at lower prices. There was a downward trend of 10 to 20 taels, and the overall situation was not good, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Tea Has Already Opened in Shangyu</h3>
<p>Each mountain household in Yushan and Shangrao in the Gan region has already finished picking the early tea and closing the gardens. The production of the first tea is still good. Because banditry in the Changyu area has gradually subsided, farmers can pick tea with peace of mind. The harvest of the first tea in the two counties has increased compared to last year. Tea dealers from the local area and other ports have already begun buying and selling. A small number of tea shops in Hekou, Shangrao, Yucheng, Tongcun Street, and foreign firms are also active. Recently, the opening price of Yushan tea has been from 30 to 24 or 25 yuan per dan, but the quality is low. Other tea shops are not interested due to the sluggish sales of low-grade goods in the Shanghai market. The future of the tea market does not seem to be progressing, and mountain prices will be difficult to raise, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market – Japanese Sugar Continues to Open with 25,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Local Factory Crystal Sugar Rises by 2 Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegraphs reported that the spot price of Cuban sugar was unchanged, New York sugar futures fell by 4 points in May and December, fell by 5 points in September, and fell by 3 points in March of next year. There was no change in the price of Java spot and futures sugar. There was very little trading in the Association's Dutch sugar, 24-grade coarse-grain white, with high-quality sugar at 11.25 taels and ordinary sugar at 11.10 taels. The market situation was unremarkable. Medium-grain white was at 10.05 taels, with a stable trend. The Japanese sugar market appeared weak, with N Mark at 11.10 taels, YT Mark at 11.05 taels, YRO Mark at 10.06 taels, SH Mark at 10.075 taels, TM Mark at 10.09 to 8.75 taels, YP Mark at 11.45 taels, J Mark at 11.45 taels, and TX Mark at 11.30 taels. Trading was very sluggish. Jardine Matheson's B Mark was at 11.45 taels, with little demand. In the Japanese sugar factory market, Meiji offered 15,000 bags of June, July, and August goods, with YT Mark priced at 4.40 Japanese gold. Minghua also offered 10,000 bags, priced at 6.55 yuan including tax. The market was also stable and unremarkable. Li Ji opened sales of 250 tons of Dutch raw red sugar for immediate shipment, priced at 5.15 Dutch currency. Wan Xin Hao offered several hundred bags of raw red sugar at a price increase of 9.6 taels. Shangbing White, a domestic product, was also offered at a price of 13.4 taels. Local factory crystal flower green opened at 9.8 taels. Shanghai factory opened Hong Zi at 14 taels and Gan Zi at 13.9 taels. Huanggang Green opened at a price increase of 8.2 taels. The market was very firm.</p>
<h3>Textiles – Direct Tribute Napped Cloth Inventory is Scarce</h3>
<p>Textile trading was greatly affected by the continuous rainy days. Although the gold market surged yesterday, people's hearts were still difficult to uplift, mainly because the off-season had arrived. However, the downward trend had ceased, and traders' attitudes were quite firm, with prices all expensive. Local merchants had no interest and found it difficult to sell. In addition, there were still many hand goods, and few rose in price. Yesterday, direct tribute napped cloth was relatively firm due to its gradually thinning inventory. Hunting Goose was at 3.6 cent, Mogan Mountain was at 3.55 cent, bleached cloth was stable, No. 5600 Jinshan Temple was at 12.65 taels, Guo Ziyi was at 12.8 taels, and Fortune Longevity Three Stars was at 11.1 taels. Floral patterns were lacking, and printed cotton gauze was slightly soft. Plain white Three Horse Head local market had some transactions yesterday, selling at 2.3 cent. Blue striped Satin had fallen by 1.5 li in recent days due to the abundant arrivals. Army Agricultural Map and Yang Guifei were both at 2.25 cent. Yu Yu silk was still selling sporadically, with Clear Official Mirror at 11.75 taels, Bamboo Forest at 11.65 taels, and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon at 11.45 taels, it is said.</p>

<h3>Recent Canadian Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>Canada's national colors in literature are becoming increasingly strong, especially recently. This phenomenon can be said to be half due to the stimulation of Professor V.B. Rhodenizer. Rhodenizer's new "A Handbook on Canadian Literature" is the first comprehensive, fluent, concise, and fair treatise in this regard. He courageously pays special attention to modern works, believing that the superior position in novels should belong to the melancholy but not silent Swede, Frederick Philip Grove. As for the famous female writer Mazo de la Roche, he quite despises her, because she is superficial and lacks "realism." On the whole, this is indeed a valuable work. Only his view of valuing the genius of tragedy and despising the genius of comedy is the only shortcoming of the book.</p>
<p>Ms. Mazo de la Roche's new work "The Portrait of a Dog" is a moving biography depicting her beloved dog. This is a very beautifully written book that everyone who has read it likes, but some also feel it is a pity, thinking that she should continue to write her "Jalna" series, without having to change to write other works midway. This series of novels has now been written in its third volume, and can be published this fall. The whole book will be about four volumes. After completion, it will of course become a literary masterpiece of modern Canada.</p>
<p>Frederick Philip Grove's new work "The Yoke of Life" is the opposite of Mazo de la Roche. It is his most important and most superior work. In other words, it is his masterpiece. This is a very powerful novel, far superior in structure to his autobiographical "A Search for America," and exceeding his "Settlers of the Marsh" in breadth, depth, refinement, and diction. Because the themes are the same, if we want to compare this novel with other works, then only Hardy's "Jude the Obscure" can be used. However, Grove's novel is not an imitation of Hardy's, because he had not read a single line of Hardy's work when he wrote this novel.</p>
<p>In the modern Canadian literary scene, there is a strange figure who has reached the center of the Canadian literary scene from a side road. He is a French immigrant to Canada, but is now also recognized as a new figure in the French literary scene. This person is Maurice Constantin Weyer, who won the French Prix Goncourt two years ago. Weyer worked as a farmer in Manitoba, Canada for twelve years. In 1914, he abandoned everything and returned to his homeland to join the army. After the war, he returned to Canada again, but his own farm had become barren and dilapidated and could not be repaired. So he quickly ran to Paris and became a writer. Since his maiden work "A Man Scans his Past" won the Prix Goncourt, his literary career began. This novel is a work in the tradition of Goncourt. Except for a simple plot and a rigid background, there is nothing else. The background is Canada, but this Canada is only what the French see in their eyes, and the whole article is full of the abstract enthusiasm that the French like.</p>
<p>This amazing writer has written a completely different work this year, "A Martyr's Folly," which is purely local, just as his maiden work was purely foreign. This book is a biography in the form of a novel, written about the story of Louis Riel. Louis Riel was the leader of the rebels in the Northwest Rebellion of Canada in 1877 and 1885. The author used this person's frankness to depict how this enthusiastic and capable but chaotic young man became the leader of the struggling masses because of the mediocrity and incompetence of his kinsmen. The cause of the struggle was that the Hudson's Bay Company sold the land that is now western Canada to the colonial government, but did not take into account the rights of the local residents. Therefore, these residents resisted, and Louis Riel became their leader. He was not a capable person, but he finally won some preferential treatment for his people and full rights for their Roman Church. However, the British Protestants who suffered in the rebellion demanded that the murderers be arrested and severely punished. At this time, Riel's friends abandoned Riel and followed him to be arrested and hanged. His crime was "political, legal, religious assassination conspiracy."</p>
<p>War novels are still very popular in the modern Canadian literary scene. Among several first-class war novels, George A. Drew's "Canada's Fighting Airmen" is the most magnificent, but it is inevitably too much praise for the natives. This book contains ten stories, written about the achievements of Canada's top ten airmen in the European War. In August 1914, when the European War broke out, the British had less than one hundred combat aircraft. But by the time of the armistice, the number of aircraft used was more than 22,000, and the number of personnel used was 30,000, of which one-third were Canadians. According to official statistics, Canadian Bishop and Cole Shaw both had higher scores than any British air officer in destroying enemy aircraft. These two, along with Barker and McLaren, are four Canadians among the world's top ten airmen.</p>
<p>Contemporary issues have recently attracted the attention of Canadian writers, especially the issue of foreign trade. The famous</p>
<h3>Canadian Satirist</h3>
<p>Stephen Leacock has always been famous for his unique humorous and satirical articles, but unexpectedly, he is a professor of economics at a university. Recently, he published "Economic Prosperity in the British Empire," advocating that for the sake of British manufacturers, autonomous Canada should still be changed to a colony, directly under the jurisdiction of London, and should absorb 2 million British immigrants every year in order to solve the difficulty of the British population surplus. This is a truly appalling method, but it is said that Leacock is a comedian, so his economic monograph can only be regarded as a comedy novel. Although this painting has great value in enjoying British medals,</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Seeing the 5th Morning Light Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Guo Li</p>
<p>Before I express my thoughts, I want to state that I am an amateur when it comes to painting, so if there are any inappropriate words, please, fellow painters, do not laugh at me.</p>
<p>This day was May Day, so I was very happy to have the opportunity to see everyone's great works. When I arrived at the Morning Light Exhibition and went upstairs, the first thing I saw was Mr. Bao Yi's "Charcoal Sketch." Walking further ahead, I was startled. It turned out to be Mr. Hua Fu's "Red Terror" and Mr. Ying Peng's "Shooting" and "Hou Yi Shooting the Sun," as well as "Impression of Changsha." These works all stirred my soul, and I admired the greatness of the authors, who used their pens to depict a scene of life and vividly present it before our eyes. The authors used the crystallization of their passionate experiences, making us feel it in both body and soul. Indeed, only when painting reaches this level can it fully express the author's great personality. Furthermore, at this moment, I also remembered a saying from my friend Yuan Qing: "A successful work is truly the crystallization of the author's fresh blood." So many successful works, all made of fresh blood, are especially admirable given the difficulties faced by the comrades of the Morning Light Society.</p>
<p>As for the many works among them, they are all very good. Mr. Bao Yi's works, as expected of a veteran, show Mr. Chen's strength in composition, color, and brushstrokes. Especially that "Facial Sketch" truly has a special style, and the colors are even more extraordinary. Also, in my ignorant opinion, Mr. Ying Peng's "Shooting" has a style rarely seen in China. The colors are strong, giving a very stimulating feeling, and I also feel that it is somewhat similar to the style in the works of Franz Yon Stuck. That horse shooting is such an expression of beauty and strength. Not only that, but it also produces what the Japanese Takama calls intellectual art. Perhaps even these are not enough to describe it.</p>
<p>In addition, works such as "Trembling of the Night," "Wild Rose," "Crowd," "Flower Seller," "Victims," as well as "Peach Blossoms," "Jiangwan Road," "Fallen Leaves," "Continuation of the Sea Port," and "West Lake" all clearly show the various techniques, color schemes, compositions, and brushstrokes, revealing different unique styles. In short, this exhibition has at least given me very good knowledge, thoughts, and impressions. However, I also hope to see some works on patterns in the 6th exhibition. Perhaps this time it was inconvenient or for other reasons that they were not exhibited. I subjectively desire this at least, and also hope that all gentlemen will break the dullness of the current Chinese art world.</p>
<p>In short, there are other good works that are too numerous to mention. At the same time, I feel that my nonsense should also come to an end, otherwise, the more I talk, the more it will become a joke.</p>

<h3>Northern Journey Jottings</h3>
<p>— An Nian</p>
<p>14. Fragments of Yanjing (Part 2)</p>
<p>The female dormitory is built entirely facing south. You can naturally imagine how bright and warm the house is when the sun shines through the windows. Males are not allowed to enter the female dormitory. The place for men and women to talk is Sister Hall. There are two Sister Halls in total, because the appearance and interior layout are the same, hence the name "Sister." The interior of Sister Hall is very exquisite. The gilded ceiling is like the houses in the imperial palace, except that the interior is a spacious room, not a box-like arrangement. This is indeed not a very intimate place for "romantic" aspirations. I heard that the Yanjing Weekly also discussed this matter for a period of time. People are naturally jealous, and those without a pair are in the majority, so the suggestion to divide Sister Hall into several boxes was finally rejected.</p>
<p>The women's gymnasium is very large. The men's gymnasium at Yanjing has not yet been fully completed. The men's gymnasium is built in the same style as the women's gymnasium. When I went to visit, the female instructor inside came out to greet me and was very polite.</p>
<p>The men's dormitory is generally facing west and east. In the middle is a lane with rooms on both sides. Only the sixth dormitory is like the female dormitory, with a single row of rooms facing south. In front of the sixth dormitory, there is a lake. This lake has become a very good scenic view for Yanjing University. In winter, the lake freezes and becomes a skating rink. In summer, willows hang around, and many small boats ripple on the water. Yanjing also has a water tower that is also very beautiful. It was originally a monotonous water tower, but because they wanted to decorate it to make it look better, they spent money and rebuilt it. The shadow of the tower reflected in the lake is very beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>The hospital in Yanjing is also very comfortable. Many people often pretend to be sick because they want to enjoy a few days of bliss in the hospital. Of course, those who pretend to be sick are not necessarily allowed to move into the hospital, but the comfort of the hospital can be imagined from this. The hospital is built behind a small hill and also has a sunbathing platform.</p>
<p>Every building in Yanjing has a telephone room. Many professors' houses are equipped with telephones. These telephones naturally refer to internal extensions. For example, if you want to visit a professor, you can call ahead to notify them, or if you want to call a classmate to chat, you can also call them. In addition, Yanjing also has internal mailboxes and another type of internal postage stamp, so transportation is also very convenient.</p>
<p>The professors at Yanjing probably each have a house. Besides Yanjing itself, the nearby areas are mostly residential areas for faculty, with so-called Yandong Garden, Yannan Garden, Tongfu, etc. There are also many large gardens, such as Dayuan, etc., which are inhabited by Yanjing faculty and staff. There are more than 280 faculty and staff at Yanjing. The residences of the professors alone number more than 100. These houses are all provided by the school.</p>
<p>Yanjing's library is naturally not as good as Tsinghua, and there are not as many books as in Tsinghua, but in terms of Chinese books, it is the best in the country, because the Columbia University and Harvard University in the United States have a Chinese Culture Research Association's book department, which is attached to Yanjing's library. They have plenty of money to buy those precious books.</p>
<p>If you haven't been to Yanjing, you must think that studying at Yanjing and buying books would be more expensive than at ordinary schools (because many of their books are original), but in fact, it is the opposite. It is common to not buy ten books in four years of study at Yanjing. In the first and second years, there may be a few basic books to buy, but in the third and fourth years, there is simply no need to buy a book. The reason is not that all courses require taking notes. To put it bluntly, all textbooks are provided by the school. Yanjing offers a very large number of courses each term. Because there are many courses offered, students are divided, and the number of students who select each course is reduced, so generally only about ten people attend each course, and the library has all the books used for each course. The library always has seven or eight copies of the same textbook. If only about ten people choose this course, then isn't it enough to have seven or eight copies of this book in the library?</p>
<p>These books cannot be borrowed, so if you want to prepare for class, you must go to the library.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Female Students Establish Track and Field Team</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Since Ms. Sun Guiyun showed her talent at the National Games last year, all female students in the country know the importance of sports, and are unwilling to lag behind, actively rising up to engage in sports. Jiaotong University female students recently have a slogan, saying "Sun Guiyun is also a person, I am also a person. Guiyun can break the 100-meter record, can't I? There is Guiyun Bridge in Hangzhou, who knows if after this year's National Games in Nanjing, I can't have my name named on a Nanjing bridge? It is up to the person to do it."</p>
<p>Since the Jiaotong University female students have this grand ambition, they are particularly diligent in field events. There is a garden in front of the female dormitory, with a track around it. It was not very straight, but now, at the request of the female students, the sports authorities have instructed the engineering department to straighten it immediately, marking out the 100-meter line, 200-meter line, and 400-meter line.</p>
<p>Every morning, three ladies are constantly seen running in the garden. One is Ms. Li Xuan, who is petite but has a large stride. Unfortunately, she cannot last long. She is naturally adept at 50 meters and 100 meters. The second is Ms. Wu Shiying, who is from Guangdong. She previously studied at the First Girls' Middle School in Guangdong. At that time, her 100-meter time was 15 seconds, winning first place. Now, because she has not trained for a long time, her performance has declined when she first tried. The third is Ms. Hou Yufen. Ms. Hou is very good at sprinting, with a graceful starting posture. Her 100-meter time is about 14 seconds. The three ladies have now invited Mr. Chen Yutian, a graduate of the school, a famous football player and sprinter in Shanghai, to coach them. Mr. Chen comes to the school three times a week, teaching them everything about starting methods, stride length, and all postures, and has also ordered a textbook for textual teaching.</p>
<p>In terms of track events, in addition to sprinting, there is also the low hurdles event, which is also being prepared for training and joining. The trainees are Ms. Tao Chun and Ms. Wu Shu, but they have not officially started yet.</p>
<p>In terms of field events, there are three events: shot put, long jump, and high jump. Shot put is the forte of Ms. Wu Shiying and Ms. Hou Yufen. They can throw casually and achieve results of 8 or 9 meters. The instructor for the long jump event is still Mr. Chen Yutian. Those who have joined the training are Ms. Li Xuan, Ms. Zhu Yaozhen, and Ms. Wen Jie. Although the results in the high jump event are not high, there are many trainees, including Wang Hengling, Zhu Yaozhen, Wen Jie, Wu Shu, Tao Chun, etc., seven or eight people.</p>
<p>In total, there are twelve members of the track and field team. It has now been organized, and Ms. Hou Minfen has been elected as the captain, Ms. Wu Shiying as the manager, and Mr. Wang, a male student, as the secretary. At this year's Jiangda Games, because the school's female students are just starting out, except for Ms. Hou's and Ms. Wu's sprinting and Ms. Hou's shot put, they are not very confident in the rest, so only Ms. Hou and Ms. Wu were sent as representatives. In the preliminary round on the first day, both were selected. Although they only scored one point in the finals, it seemed even more glorious compared to the blank scores of Guanghua and other schools. It is heard that the team secretary said that the team captain recently issued three rules: (1) No absence from training without reason. (2) No joking or playing during training. (3) No disobedience to the instructor's guidance. Violations will result in a warning for the first offense, a serious warning for the second offense, a warning from the sports authorities for the third offense, and a deduction of one sports credit from the sports authorities for the fourth offense to show punishment, it is said.</p>
<h3>A Disturbing Lesson</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>"Di, what is this class?" Wei said urgently, looking at the letter she had just received.</p>
<p>"Oh, how come you don't know? This class is what you call the 'optional class.' Now, are you going to write love letters again?" Di, with an envious and mocking face, smiled at Wei.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm naturally writing love letters. Why don't you take some time to write to your lover, Ruo? You know, he's longing for you," Wei said triumphantly, taking out blue ink, a pen, and stationery from the desk.</p>
<p>"What's there to long for or not? I never want to do what you do, putting aside books and focusing all my attention on writing love letters. I honestly tell you, although I also like to be in love and have a lover, I definitely don't want to put aside any subject. I believe that since we are students now, we should put the idea of studying above everything else..."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, Ms. Di, please stop! I already understand your 'doctrine.' I remember you've preached it several times," Wei said, looking at her solemn back.</p>
<p>"Don't make any noise. If the old man comes in to teach and hears you, wouldn't it be embarrassing?" This was the accent of Ms. Hong from Beiping. She was very focused on reading a copy of "The Vanguard Monthly." Probably, she was confused by their noises, so she suddenly came out to stop them.</p>
<p>"What's embarrassing? Look at him himself..." Wei was about to get excited and continue speaking, but Mr. Ke's head had already stretched into the classroom door. She saw him, shrank her head, shrugged her shoulders, and quickly lowered her head, pretending that she was originally writing a letter.</p>
<p>"Ge..." Mr. Ke tapped his leather shoe heel loudly on the podium, called the roll, and opened the book to start the class. He first drew several connected triangles on the blackboard, and then slowly taught us in English, "Because this angle is a right angle, so that angle is like this, and that angle is like that..." Several good students who scored a hundred and ninety in geometry also happily agreed with him. Several students who did not score as well as them coldly shouted, "I don't understand, I don't understand. Please explain it again, explain it more clearly." So Mr. Ke stared incredulously at the students who shouted and repeated the teaching of this angle and that angle.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ms. Qin, with a drawn-out throat, said in a melodious voice, "This kind of geometry is really confusing. It's hard enough to understand it, but after a few days, I'll return it all to you. What's the use of us reading it? Moreover, studying this kind of geometry is the most boring thing." She usually listened to Mr. Ke's lecture haphazardly in geometry class, if she had already finished writing a reply to her lover. Otherwise, she was just like Wei, willing to sacrifice her homework and wholeheartedly write love letters.</p>
<p>"Qin, you're wrong. Studying geometry is really interesting. If you find it boring, you should blame yourself for not... Usually in this class, you don't often write... Don't you think it's useless and unworthy of studying?" Ying felt that saying the word love letter was very embarrassing, so she quickly changed the meaning. She was one of Mr. Ke's favorites, always handing in her paper first for every exam, and her grades were the best.</p>
<p>"You've given your heart to your lover, so naturally you'll find geometry tasteless." This was the instruction of another geometry king. She spoke the word lover in a particularly low voice and glanced at Mr. Ke.</p>
<p>"Don't be hypocritical. Mr. Ke, you see many students writing love letters, but you don't care at all," Di told the teacher unfairly, after she finished copying the geometry proof on the blackboard and heard them arguing too noisily. She might have been thinking, "Several sloppy students are happily and sweetly writing love letters. I'll write too, but I don't want to put it down. If I listen to the teacher, I won't be able to concentrate because of their noise."</p>
<p>"Okay, everyone be quiet and listen to me. I know some of you are writing letters. I don't forbid them. First, I originally hoped that they would realize it themselves. Second, the 'love' of young people is the easiest to be moved, the richest, and the most passionate. If I ignorantly forbid them, they would have to stop writing. But if their hearts still don't stop, or even burn more passionately, what I teach won't enter their ears. Then, why should I force them to sit there for an hour? So, my idea is only to let it be natural. Listen to me if you want to listen, don't listen if you don't want to listen. Everything is up to you. Anyway, people who are not interested will never learn well in their lifetime."</p>
<p>"But, that's not right, Mr. Ke. How do you know if a person is interested or not?" Ms. Hong from Beiping asked, seemingly refuting and doubting.</p>
<p>"That's very simple. Those who are interested will put everything aside and listen to me," he said, wiping the words off the blackboard, intending to teach the next section.</p>
<p>Wei suddenly thought of something and said urgently, "Mr. Ke, you say that the 'love' of young people is the easiest to be moved and the most passionate, then I ask you, how is your 'love'?" Wei smiled cheekily at Mr. Ke's glowing face.</p>
<p>"Don't make noise. I'm going to teach the next section. It will be tested. It's very important," Mr. Ke quickly said several "important" words in a row. As for Wei's question, it could be considered an answer.</p>
<p>"Leave it for next time. The section you taught today is enough to make our brains confused."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ke, there are only ten minutes left. Give us a break."</p>
<p>"Teaching too much is like eating too much food, it can't be digested."</p>
<p>"………………………………"</p>
<p>It was noisy and disturbing, like what the teacher said, we were like a "teahouse."</p>
<p>"Then, if you don't want to teach, then don't teach. Anyway, the teacher is a servant of the students, and everything is up to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, we're afraid that teaching too much will only make what we already understand confusing," Hong and many classmates said.</p>
<p>"In short, you never tire of reading and writing love letters. You are willing to use 'love' to bewitch yourself and bind yourself. As for geometry or other subjects, you are not willing to do it as dedicatedly as you do with love letters."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ke, it seems that you are also bewitched by 'love.' In your book clip, there is a very beautiful……………… photo," Wei said with a smile, as if unable to bear it.</p>
<p>"Who said it's a lover? No, no. Don't talk nonsense. Since we're not going to continue teaching, let's dismiss class," Mr. Ke's face gradually flushed. He quickly left the classroom. At that time, the dismissal bell had not yet rung, but a burst of enthusiastic cheers replaced it.</p>
<h3>A Sound of "Hang Yu"... and Others</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Datong University has always held the purpose of "saving the country through reading" and has very few opportunities to contact the outside world, so Datong in the West Gate school district, the general public does not pay much attention to the existence of this institution of higher learning. Therefore, news about Datong is not easily heard.</p>
<p>But now it is different. On the one hand, they are still working hard on scholarship, and at the same time, they have a tendency to be active with the outside world, full of vitality, especially in the effort of material construction. Last semester, a sound of "Hang Yu" broke the silence in the air. Listening to lectures in the classroom, one could still faintly hear the lingering sound of them—coolies. Students hoped for the end of the "Hang Yu" sound every day, yearning for a magnificent gymnasium, which was completed in February this year for the 20th anniversary. The area is wide.</p>
