<p>（日内瓦）　今日白里安又致函日代表芳澤、日軍事當局擅取東三省鹽稅、足使時局益增嚴重、并提醒芳澤曩在理事會所予不令時局及視日僑安全程度而撤兵之保證、請其促進和平、因和平爲達到日本所要求之安全程度所不可少者、又謂奪取鹽稅之舉、顯然與日僑生命財産之安全無甚關係、所以此舉與日本所予之撤兵諒解、不相符合、諒日本深知負有設法勿令時局增重、及將關於提取鹽稅眞相報告理事會之義務、倘閣下能迅賜一切有用報告、俾各理事獲知眞相、無任欣幸云云、（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本今仍堅持以提交日内瓦之五基本原則爲解决滿案之基礎、官方表示日本欲中國以國聯爲證人、簽定包含此種原則之協定書、然後始允與中國協商撤兵詳則、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　芳澤大使對白里安關於十月二十六日日政府聲明書反駁意見之答文内容、昨日由外務省公表、其要旨如下、日政府贊成白里安主張九月三十日國聯理事會决議有效之意見、並有速時撤兵之希望、該項决議内雖要求中國保護日僑生命財産、然日本不能期於日軍撤退後、中國確能維持和平秩序、中國當局准許排日運動、且不重條約上之權利、於此狀態之下、日僑之安全决不存在也、兹觀中國代表十月二十四日關於尊重日本條約上權利之函書、中國政府似提出條約之效力問題、日本政府絕對不能承認此種主張、如容認一國對於國際條約加以疑義、是即破壞世界秩序者也、日本主張不外於以直接交涉、承認規律中日間正常關係之大綱也、（八日日聯社電）</p>

<h3 id="c20">怎樣體認田中奏摺（一） <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>日田中義一内閣計劃侵略我東北積極政策的奏摺。現已成爲舉世共知的「公開之秘密」。了這一極其酷毒並極其周詳的大陰謀姑無論其是否遂能天從人願。全如所算。但此一計劃之足以使全世界全人類今後陷於非常不安的境地。時時感受到一種即將發生的悲慘事實之威脅。殆毫無可疑。</p>
<p>特别是中國。在事實上是處於此一悲劇的主要角色的地位。東京的野心軍閥政客的一舉一動。都以中國爲其對象。而且事實上。亦足以使中國立即感受到切膚之痛。田中奏摺中謂。「如欲征服支那。必先征服滿蒙。如欲征服世界。必先征服支那。此乃明治大帝之遺策。是亦我日本帝國之存立上必要之事也。」這幾句話是何等的咄咄逼人。令人毛髮悚竪。同時亦可使我們瞭然於所謂滿蒙積極政策之樹立。我國家處於適當其衝的地位。先世界而首蒙其殃。故世界人士固絕不容忽視田中奏摺。而我國人對此一生死關切的酷毒陰謀。尤應有深切的體認。</p>
<p>在體認田中的酷毒陰謀之先。我們應具有幾個基本概念。即從日帝國主義者的國勢與環境。把握住日帝國主義者對外侵略。尤其是近年來側重於北進向大陸發展的「因素」。因爲宇宙間一切的現象。都不是偶然的。在互相綜錯着的極其繁複的事實堆裏。一定可以找出「所以如此」的綫索。即是說一切的現象。都須受「因果鐡律的支配」。</p>
<p>日帝國主義者何以要積極向外侵略。田中義一的滿蒙積極政策。何以會産生呢。我們先介紹美國哥倫比亞大學敎授湯麥斯蒙在其所著帝國主義與世界政治（darker　Thomas　Moon　Imperialism　and　World　Politics）上。論到「日本帝國主義」的話來說明。</p>
<p>「……普通爲日本帝國主義辯論的理由。……（一）日本有「人口過剩」之患一定要找安插地。日本的人口比較稠密。就全體論。他們都有貧窮的恐懼。這是確實的。但是很明白的日本所併合的土地。不能爲日本人口過剩的安插地。日本人假若不能得到美國加拿大及澳大利亞的允許移入。依舊願意在日本居住。因爲這些地方工資高。尋利易。故他們願易去。故「過剩人口」。確實不能爲日本帝國主義的大理由。（二）日本需要原料及食品。特别需要米鐡及煤。這也是確實的。不過這對任何工業國家都是一樣。而問題的焦點。是在一個國家是否應當去買她所需要的原料。或去併吞出産原料的國家。…　　「日本帝國主義的眞正原因。大部分仍在日本資本家求利之心。軍閥的侵略慾望。……自一八六七年明治維新後。由長洲及薩摩二藩之中産生了一部分軍事領袖。在日本政府裏握有很大的權力。在他們估計到陸海軍的利益的時候。日本憲法及議會只是假面具而已。日本的軍閥。意欲征服。全以軍事策略的眼光觀察遠東的局勢。……」</p>

<p>▲如有實力便不怕國際聯盟了</p>
<p>高柳主席論排日運動</p>
<p>滿洲問題已提到國際盟去了、這其間有利於日本之處、也有不利於日本之處、但如若是我們所準備的實力能得充分的發揮、便没有什麽可怕的了、我們應認定滿洲問題和抵制日貨運動是一個問題、這是因爲日本在滿蒙有了特殊權益、惹人憎厭、而發生的問題、排日運動、在今年已是第九回了、有兩回是在大正四年以前、其後又有七回、中國的抵抗日貨、是非武力的對日本的敵對行爲、因此我們應該認定滿洲問題與排日是一個問題、我以爲這問題應分五點來逐次討論、（一）此一問題的解决方法、（二）滿蒙的獨立問題、（三）與國際聯盟的關係、（四）其經濟的可能性、（五）抵制日貨問題、依據上述五點、先就日本在滿洲如何受中國的暴壓、以及我們希望怎樣解决、請長春的彼末氏來發言、</p>
<p>▲解决之途長春代表彼末氏</p>
<p>現在的滿洲、眞使我們感覺困難了、因爲時間的關係、對這問題、我不能很詳細的説明、而只作單簡的叙述、並申述怎樣纔是這問題解决的方法、我在滿洲住了二十七年、在這當中、每年所發生的問題、都是由於不履行條約所引起、關於解决的方法、有種種不同的論調、有的甚至說到不惜和蘇聯或美國開戰、但是我以爲應視東北四省爲中國獨立的政權、使其成爲對外交涉的團體、我國可以直接同他交涉、不必向南京政府交涉、或有人主張將東北四省完全開放、成爲不駐一兵的和平地境、若果如此、則日本人便將再没有發展的可能、中國人的個性力好像一粒砂子、日本人的團體力好比一塊水門汀、這是我們常常感覺到的、而且任何中國人先天的都詳細的知道對於匯欵的每日的兌換行市、這一點、日本人無論如何也比不上、因此、雖在和平的境地、日本人亦將缺少發展性、所以我以爲滿洲應確立一新的政權、而不和南京政府交涉、這便是解放交涉的主要點、</p>
<p>▲十年所未嚥下者今已一旦嚥下蘇峰翁的熱辯</p>
<p>我之立塲、與實業家的立塲不同、可是我對於滿蒙問題、一向都是很關心、自明治二十七八年交還遼東半島、經過三十七八年的戰役、我對這問題、更加關心、即對於政府、我也曾稍盡微力、小村侯曾說、「移往美國去的人應都移往滿蒙去、　這是日本人歷史繼續下來的問題、對於這一問題、决不能確實保證未必日本不失敗、假使日本終歸於失敗、則在這最後時機、將不能不放棄滿蒙、這雖不是一時的問題、但今已是我們應當澈底研究的時候了、我們無論在任何時、都要不斷的想到這個問題、現在的日本不可以歐洲各小國作目標、而惹起懦弱的思想、即日說現在的日本已是强大了、應以大國的見地來解决這個問題、如果有了一致的國論、世界各國便没有什麽可懼、現在的狀態、只是日本人自相恐嚇、我們對於世界、特别是對於引起各種問題的美國、不可以要求他的好感而發生讓步的思念、即是說當面乃是日本外交的個轉機、我們對於滿蒙問題、青年們都以爲不必千算萬計對付這没甚關係的滿蒙問題、應知道要救朝鮮、當以滿洲爲起點、同時如高柳博士所說、我們必須把滿蒙問題、與抵制日貨當作一個問題、應統一國論、鞭韃政府、由我國來定世界的輿論、正如我們業已上船、必欲澈底的駕駛過去、我們自己對這問題的關心是最要緊的我願各位的意見都能一致、以求圓滿的解决、滿洲不是中國、滿洲就是滿洲、這是世界所已公認、即中國人自己也這樣承認、日本人當說的不說、實爲失算、我們是要這十年所未嚥下的東西、現在决然嚥下、我聽了大阪實業家對此問題、持非常强硬的論調、使我非常高興、而感覺胆壯、我們盡力計劃國策、軍人當勇敢戰爭、我們非得一致國論、使政略得以實行不可、（未完）</p>

<p>東華諾堡第一塲史高托杯苦戰、旣以○比○終局、於是兩隊皆刻苦更練、抱得勝之决心、雙雄重逢、戰鬥必更烈、故昨日之觀衆、較上次更衆、足有萬五千人之數以致立無隙地、座者亦不得不起立、婦孺輩亦苦立九十分鐘、盛况可以想見、</p>
<p>▲爆竹震天健兒登場</p>
<p>開賽前十分鐘、東華隊隊長周賢言率領全軍將士登塲作戰、爆作之聲、頓時四起、聲震雲霄、預祝東華勝利也、擁護之熱忱可見、周鐡門之猩紅球衣、鮮紅奪目、有謂紅者喜也、此東華之所以護勝也、</p>
<p>▲東華前鋒龍騰虎躍</p>
<p>東華昨日前鋒之五虎、銳利無比、進退合作、熨貼可觀、且軍行神速、一轉瞬間、已達諾軍門前、惜失去射門機會無數、故讚美聲中、同時有少婉惜之音、五鋒中個個活躍、無暇可擊、因前鋒之攻烈、故周賢言之地位、亦遠不如上次之緊張、中衛線因屠開元之减色、失此中線聯絡、前後行動、稍感困乏、</p>
<p>▲一分鐘内敵門動搖</p>
<p>接觸不一分鐘、東華即全線總攻、屠開元遠送一球、錢敬鏞帶之直進、陳洪光撥向中去、戴中鋒挑至右角、陳虞添趕上、陳家球再送一脚、戴與李義臣、已直抵門前、諾森堡守門苦守待斃、而李義臣大好機會、竟射之不中、一片婉惜之聲起於四座、時開賽僅一分鐘耳、</p>
<p>▲斜裏飛來東華失守</p>
<p>屠開元接着再送一球、錢敬鏞挑起一勾、落點準確無比、惜亦未得、李義臣傳球至戴、陳家球送達虞添、虞添如飛而進、陳洪光接來一頂、用力過鉅、越木飛過、東華之上塲聲勢、盛極一時、不料猛攻一刻鐘不破、諾將包滿截得來球、遠飛左角、薛特爾輕輕向左一揮、楊格提起射門、有力而準、來勢旣凶、周賢言失之不備、東華竟先告失守、</p>
<p>▲神妙合作敵門陷落</p>
<p>東華無意之中、中敵之計、仍未稍餒、積極進取、三次極好角球、皆歸無效、東華之勢、漸露疲弛、諾軍則上前攻打、錢敬鏞在左則活動甚力、一次得戴中鋒來球、距門僮五碼之地、舉足稍遲、失之殊惜、戰已半個小時錢接得來球、急送周戴、陳虞添撥之向内、李義臣不偏不倚、射之入網合作神妙、至於極巔、東華乃造一比一和局、</p>
<p>▲十二碼球不中大幸</p>
<p>離上半局終、僅五分鐘矣、忽陳家球在罰球區域内、違犯規則、判罰十二碼、一時空氣緊張、如大禍驟臨、周賢言靜以待變、法威克中鋒、施用技巧、一脚向上角射去、不知球飛稍高半寸、擦木上彈回至左、李寗急忙救出、此十二碼球而不中、實東華之大幸、亦得勝之預兆矣、上半時一比一和局</p>
<p>▲二次中的越位作廢</p>
<p>少息五分鐘、易壘再戰、東華上場形勢、一如從前、鋭利無比、錢敬鏞傳球與戴、洛士美一失、中鋒飛傳與陳虞添、虞添越過戒士霍如飛衝進、趕至門前、斜起一球、適中敵網、裁判員宣告戴中鋒越位先至、接上陳洪光又攻入、又以越位作廢、因可惜而怨恨者、場中四起、</p>
<p>▲中鋒罰出敵軍瓦解</p>
<p>二次中的不計、兩方乃相持不下、時有進退、各有失機、精盡力疲、皆露倦態、距終結尙有十五分鐘、諾軍進行至東華門前裁判員以中鋒越位、鳴笛令退、而此中鋒法威克以功敗垂成、大爲怨恨、直斥裁判員爲無理、行爲失檢、裁判員立下令罰之出場、主將旣去、諾森堡攻力盡失、於是乎瓦解、有守鮮攻、惟希望再成和局耳、</p>
<p>▲最後一分鐘之凱旋</p>
<p>諾森堡旣有守無攻、東華則亦倦意流露、羣料和勢已成、豈知狂歡在焉、僅剩一分鐘許、陳虞添自右得球、穿過戒士霍、馬上加鞭、戴中鋒見時機已至、飛上策應、陳見戒士霍在後、急送與戴、中鋒見洛士美馳來阻其行進、忙向左送、陳洪光已一馬當先而至、洛蘭至此、縱有三頭六臂、亦惟有束手待斃、洪先蹴之入、東華急飛檄調兵回陣嚴守、接上裁判員鳴笛宣告終結、東華遂以二比一升入第二週、爆竹滿天、狂歡而散、</p>

<p>▲汪伍之演辭（一）汪精衛之演辭云各位代表、先要向大家說明、向來是每天九點鐘、寗粤雙方的代表、都在此處會議、今天因爲昨天會議已有了結果、所以今天寗方的代表未來、現在只有我和伍先生在此處、我們可以總括的報告各位、昨晚和平統一會議、已有了結局、已經由雙方代表聯名共發通電報告决議的經過、各位或許尙未看見、現在再說其大略、國民黨的分裂、這是大家都知道的、過去我們爲什麽要打倒北洋軍閥、就是因爲北洋軍閥的行徑、是違反民主政治、如果國民黨的人不能實現民主政治、我們也不能不努力打倒、不然、那就没有道理了、現在所有的同志和全國同胞的痛苦很深、兄弟個人亦是和人民一樣的感到同樣的痛苦、自從日本强佔東北以來、東北民衆、一定更是痛苦、原因都是没有民主政治、原來國家好比是一雙船、政府不過是船裏把舵的人、文明的國家、如果發見把舵的人不能勝任、尤其是當大風危浪的時候、人民是有權可以將把舵的人換過、把舵的人没有不聽話的、這就是民主政治的意思、最近南京覺得國内老是用兵、不是辦法、所以派蔡張陳諸先生爲代表、廣東非常會議、也即派兄弟等爲代表、這裏討論黨務政治的改革和外交的方針、最先討論的是外交問題、第一先决定對外一致、不過對外一致是有附帶解釋的、</p>
<p>這回東三省的事件、邊防軍完全不抵抗、幾小時喪失多少地方、這是不能一致的、方針一致的原則、寗方亦說、暴日如果再來侵略、一定作自衛的抵抗、同時因爲南京的國民政府、是經國際間的承認、所以决定、對外由南京負責、交涉的方針則要大家共定、目前的辦法、是請國際聯盟主持公道、同時我們要準備最後的决心來抵抗、在座同胞所熱烈要求的、我們都明白、兄弟也具最後抵抗的决心、第二是政治制度的改革、幾年來名爲訓政、實則軍政、訓政與開明專制不同、訓政是要逐漸建設憲政的、政治制度的改革、就是主張軍民分治、主席不要大權、如果主席不好就辭職、文明國家的人、知道人家不滿意自己、自己就走、斷不要用砲來轟才走、至於總司令、文明國家、平時都不設立、就是日本天皇、戰時才兼大元帥、斷無像兩京總司令部那樣權高一切的、總之、政治改革案、第一點、修改國府組織法、制度的問題、就可解决、第二點、改組國府、人的問題、亦就可以解决、第三、關於財政問題、决定設立財政委員會、容納人民代表參加、付以整理財政、審核豫算、審核公債之發行稽核報銷公佈收支賬目之權、委員人數、政府三、人民代表十二、使人民有權審核財政、這點、南京代表亦同意了、以後除非國防剿匪外、絕對不應使人民負担内債、幾年來東南人民的負担、我們實在萬分明白同情、發行公債、如果用來打仗、不但連本錢都無、還要犧牲人民的血和汗、如果發行公債是爲着建設、那自然是很有利的、第四、關於一切糾紛、應由中央執行委員會全體會議三分二以上委員出席、及出席委員無記名表决三分二以上之可决、不得以兵力解决之、第五、關於黨務、四全會問題、南京主張如期、赴寧合開、粤方則主張改組政府後、再行開會、現在協商結果、由寧粤雙方、各於所在地開會、候選人産生方法、由雙方協商、一切外交、政財軍黨各提案、統由四屆第一次全體會議處理之、現在各推代表、分回寧粤報告、請求批准、如雙方均得批准、則幾年黨内糾紛、可有結果、我想大概雙方、總可批准吧、如果這次兩方所協商的决議能做到、各位所希望的軍民分治、便可實現、總結來說、各位代表所要求的、可以分做政治要民主化、軍事專負剿匪及國防、不得干預政治、并希望和平統一、諸位來得早、或未見報紙所載、以爲和平未必有辦法、所以這樣熱烈來請願、現在和平統一、已有了可能、請諸位監督着兩方遵照决議、更進而謀眞統一眞和平、對外抵抗帝國主義的侵略、對内實現民主政治、</p>
<p>（一）伍朝樞之演辭云、汪先生的報告、已經很清楚、兄弟無再詳說必要、不過大概說來、我們代表六人、由粤來滬、所抱的宗旨、對外則中國的領土主權、不能有絲毫損失、對内樹立民主政治、在和平會議席上所議、亦抱同一宗旨、以後仍要繼續、依照此宗旨、以謀貫澈、請上海市民全國國民、督促我們、并請監督政府去實現、</p>

<p>▲張羣演詞中央代表張羣致訓詞云、今日係王柏齡先生就上海市青年義勇軍訓練處主任職、兄弟代表中央、躬逢斯盛、臨時中宣部亦有電報致兄弟、謂因時間侷促、不能前來、派兄弟兼代、彌深榮幸愉快、王主任在過去與革命歷史上有甚深之關係、曾赴黄浦軍校、與蔣主席努力校務、而於中國之軍事改革上、尤有甚大之貢獻、此則爲我等甚欽佩者、兄弟與王先生、本係好友、在廿五年前、共留學日本時、即偕入同盟會、共同努力於學問、是時對王主任即有深切之認識、王先生尤有一事足資師法者、即彼對於無論何事、必能作深刻之研究、而得很大之成功、此次日軍侵遼吉、奪吾土地、殺我同胞、國勢至此、危急已極、吾上海學生、因之有青年義勇軍之組織、由中央訓練總監部總司令部軍政部等頒發義勇軍章程、因上海地居要衝、學生人數、亦爲最多、有設訓練處之必要、故派王主任來滬、組織訓練處、王先生不特軍學湛深、且係吾黨中堅、故取預料王主任之訓練青年義勇軍、對於軍事上敎育上及其他一切、必能趨於紀律化、科學化、必能得甚大之效果、兄弟亦係軍人出身、感到軍事訓練與其他學問不同、其他學問、可以個人私自用心、分别研究、但軍事訓練、則必一</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>心一德、守秩序、遵紀律、始能重良善之效果、此乃爲公共之團體生活、現在國家弄到了如此地步、我等務須枕戈禦日、共赴國難、上海開風氣之先、無論如何、義勇軍必須養成一甚佳之風氣、不但軍事訓練、固須臻於紀律化科學化、即軍士人格品行、亦須端方、使成爲一時之楷模、更須成爲幾十百年後永久之楷模、爲後來者及他方者留一基礎、則不但上海之學校史上能得占一席地、即於上海市史上亦得一席地、能如此、則今後日本决不敢再有侵我東北之暴行、即數十年積下之宿恥、亦可於短期間雪去云云、</p>
<p>▲陶百川詞市黨部監誓員陶百川致訓詞云、今日兄弟參預此隆重之典禮、謹祝王主任及義勇軍逹到勝利成功之目的外、尙有一小小感想、中國自立國數千年來、均係重文輕武、語云、馬上得之、不能馬上治之、其意即謂非以武力侵略得之國家、不能以武力治之、故歷代建國之後、必須偃武修文、又有一俗語、說好男不當兵、好鐡不打釘、此語更爲普通、而其意更爲明顯、又曰、别人懷寳劍、吾有筆如刀、於此均足表現我國歷代之重文輕武、洎乎今日、外侮侵來、乃採取無抵抗主義、而對内則又不能安寗、内外交迫、乃造成中國現代之社會現象、此不可謂非重文輕武之結果、曾憶日本有一學者、著一書曰併吞滿蒙論内、謂中國有二種人民、一爲土匪、一爲良民、凡文武周公孔孟之流、均爲土匪、餘乃爲良民、而此良民對於民族思想、甚爲漠然、故雖併學生義勇軍訓練處同人攝影</p>
<p>吞之亦無妨、惟所怕者、即爲土匪、現代土匪、即爲青年學生、此輩頗爲厲害、對於民族思想及其他問題、咸有深切之諒解、但幸而祇能口頭文字宣傳、而無武力、吾人可以武力征服之、因此輩青年、不重於武而重於文也、故儘不妨併吞之云云、故日本四五十萬軍隊、可侵略吾中國、而吾中國有二百餘萬軍隊、不能抗日本、蓋日人重於武備、人民個個有軍事訓練、若正式開戰、則日本六千萬人民、均是軍隊、而吾國四萬萬人民、仍祇有二百萬軍隊、言之痛心、此則青年義勇軍所以不能不組織而加以訓練也、吾人舊小說上、往往言人有三頭六臂、今者吾人已有二頭、即筆頭與舌頭、若能於拳頭再加訓練、則三頭俱備、必能成世界强國云云、</p>
<p>▲褚民誼詞褚民誼氏致詞云、今日係王主任就職之期、兄弟因感覺到學界之精神甚爲渙散、務須加以團結、今日之重文輕武、誠爲不可諱飾之事實、但因現在係科學世界、槍砲軍火、亦係根據文事、文事研究科學而後發生、故希望文武并重云云、旋由婦女救濟會代表林克聰女士、及各大學抗日聯合會軍訓部代表相繼致詞、</p>
<p>▲王氏答辭王主任答云、監誓員、諸位來賓·代表·所說的、均極誠懇接受、并深深感謝盛意、現兄弟報告、義勇軍訓練情形、（一）爲什麽成立軍事訓練處、中央黨部訓練總監部敎育部會商結果、以爲各學校之軍事訓練、必須有負責機關、故根據所頒布義勇軍實施綱領規定、成立本處、（二）組織義勇軍之動機、與暴日拚命、（三）訓練方針、（甲）不妨礦學校行政（乙）尊重學生意志、現在社會人士、有一種誤解、即以爲義勇軍、即所以與敵人拚命者、實屬大謬、義勇軍係受過多年敎育之學生、有豐富之科學智識、當作士卒、犧牲沙塲、豈不可惜、故義勇軍爲領導並訓練其餘民衆之幹部、現有人催發槍枝、我以爲現在義勇軍訓練問題、乃敎育問題、非軍事問題、須基本智識弄好、才用槍枝、故現發槍事可不必、義勇軍訓練過六個月後、再受訓練時、即可發槍云、並聞王氏因出席四全大會、及軍訓事宜、有所商洽、已於昨日下午、乘四時半快車晉京、</p>

<p>▲目的似在搶金飾▲禍患起於呌救命</p>
<p>昨日下午三點三十分時、南市小南門外海潮寺南街顧家町口、發生一路刦殺人案、當時受槍傷者兩人、經路人瞥見後、代爲車送上海醫院醫治、其一甫經抵院、即已傷重殞命、其一則傷勢亦甚危險、事後調查得該兩人係屬母女、兹將情形録後、</p>
<p>▲丁氏小康浦東人丁毛毛之妻裘氏、年五十四歲、生有一女、名三郎、現年十九、一家三口、同居在南市國貨路附近三四六弄第三號門牌内、平日以種菜園爲生活、因其克勤克儉、故每月開支外、尙有餘蓄、一小康家也、</p>
<p>▲中途擱刦昨日午膳後裘氏母女二人、前往小東門購買洋布、回時已三時許、迨行經小南門外海潮寺南街顧家町口、突有暴徒兩人、均年約三十許、身服藍布短衫褲、口操江北音、上來攔住去路、出示手槍、嚇禁聲張、裘氏與女三郎、知已遇盜、頓覺大驚失色、</p>
<p>▲呼救開槍盜即慕執三郎之手、因其手腕範有金鐲一只、指上有金戒一只、遂逞强捋下金鐲後、正圖續捋其金戒及耳上金圈時、裘氏母女見盜强刧飾物、即不顧一切、上前抵抗、並極聲呼救、盜等情知不妙、陡然開槍兩響、裘氏母女兩人、應聲慘呼數聲、立即倒地、盜等見已肇成血案、立即携同所刦金鐲贓物、拔步奔逃、轉瞬間已無踪影矣、</p>
<p>▲創傷部位盜旣去遠、相繼倒臥於血泊之裘氏母女、已氣絕奄奄、裘氏左肚角、被盜擊中一槍、子彈尙未穿出、其女三郎、則傷在左乳下、子彈從背脊穿出渲紅的鮮血、由創口泊泊流出、慘白的面孔呈露着死灰之狀、實屬慘不忍覩、其時路人經過瞥見情况、即將受傷之母女二人、連同滿染血漬之洋布兩包、一併車送上海醫院、</p>
<p>▲少女殞命該女三郎、因受傷過重、抵院後未及醫治、即已香消玉殞、其母裘氏、經醫生急即設法救治、據云傷勢頗烈、性命極形危險、其夫丁毛毛聞耗、立即趕到該院、一見其女之死狀、再睹乃妻之傷態、頓時悲從中來、一慟幾絕、</p>
<p>▲傳聞禍因事後據傳云、裘氏母女因出外購買洋布、大肆裝飾、迨從小東門大街上買就洋布回時、早爲匪徒注意、故兩盜匪已躡足跟隨、至顧家町口、因該處地甚冷僻、乃即動手、不料該氏母女二人因捨所愛之金飾、致與盜匪抵抗、遂致傷命、噫、可憐已、</p>

<p>甲午戰起。湖南巡撫吳大溦請纓出師。論者均謂吳不自量。其實内中尙有他故也。時湘紳一等子爵劉鏡堂蓉。紅羊刦時中興名將也。憤倭奴之跋扈。暗中慫恿吳出而願爲之佐。詎奏章上而報可。劃忽病殁。吳一時手足無措。深悔孟浪。輾轉覓得湘紳魏光燾佐之。比及軍次錦州。距敵軍尙遠。而日探之喬裝混入者頗夥。每日嚴查。必有所得。魏親自鞫訊。濫用非刑。目不忍覩。魏從容談笑。態度安閒。間有堅不承認者。乃騐其足趾。訊實除梟首外。尙有點天燈等名目。一時人目之爲活閣羅。洵非虚語也。</p>

<p>我在太平洋會議的許多廢話中聽到了一句警語。勞耳說：「中國没有廢掉的東西，如果有，只是人的生命！」</p>
<p>人的生命！你在中國是耗廢得太多了。垃圾堆裏的破布爛棉花有老太婆們去追求，路邊餓得半死的孩子没有人過問。化十來個銅板坐上人力車要人家拚命跑，跑得吐血倒地，望也不望，便換了一部車兒走了。太太生孩子，得雇一個奶媽。自己的孩子白而胖，奶媽的孩子瘦且死。童養媳偷了一塊糖吃要被婆婆逼得上吊。做徒弟好比是做奴隸，連夜壺也要給師傅倒，倒得不乾凈，一烟袋打得腦袋開花。煤礦裏是五個人當中要殘廢一個。日本人來了一殺是幾百。大水一冲是幾萬。一年之中死的人要裝滿二十多個南京城。（說得正確些，是每年死的人數等於首都人口之二十多倍。）當我寫這篇短文的時候，每個字出世是有三個人進棺材。</p>
<p>「中國没有廢掉的東西，如果有，只是人的生命！」</p>
<p>您却不可作片面的觀察。一個孩子出天花，他的媽媽抱他在懷裏七天七夜，畢竟因爲卓絕的堅忍與慈愛救了他的小命。在這無廢物而有廢命的社會裏，這偉大的母愛是同時存在着。如果有一線的希望，她是願意爲她的小孩的生命而奮鬭，甚而至於犧牲自己的生命，也是甘心情願的。</p>
<p>這偉大的慈愛與冷酷的無情如何可以並立共存？這矛盾的社會有什麽解釋？他是我養的，我便愛他如同愛我或者愛他甚於愛我自己。若不是我養的，雖死他幾千萬，與我何干？這個態度解釋了這奇怪的矛盾。</p>
<p>中國要到什麽時候纔能翻身？要等到人命貴於財富，人命貴於機器，人命貴於安樂，人命貴於名譽，人命貴於權位，人命貴於一切，只有等到那時，中國纔能站得起來！</p>

<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>當明倭冦犯我海疆。而尤以嘉靖四十一年陷我興化府。焚掠一空。移據平海衛。（明置、城在興化府莆田縣東、）自倭蹂躙東南。破州縣衛所以百數。未有及府城者。有之自興化始。興化故名郡最繁富。旣陷。遠近震動。詔急徵俞大猷充總兵官。戚繼光爲副。合兵往討。時劉顯由廣東赴援。以兵少壁城下。不敢戰。大猷至。亦不欲攻。以俟大軍之集。乃與顯别邀賊於長樂。殲之。至是繼光先破倭於横嶼。以浙江兵來會。巡撫譚綸令繼光將中軍。顯左。大猷右。合攻賊於平海。繼光先登。左右軍繼之。斬級二千二百有奇。還被擄者三千人。倭始遁去。遂復興化。其侵犯他州縣者。亦爲諸將所敗。倭起二十餘載。攻破城邑。殺傷官吏。下及軍民。不可勝計。轉漕增餉。宇内騷然。至此大創而去。東南半壁。甫得安枕。而繼光屢摧大冦。（平浙閩之倭、又平江西之賊、）號稱名將。而其功更出劉顯俞大猷上。</p>
<p>嗣至隆慶元年。夏五月。給事中吳時來。以薊門多警。請召大猷及繼光。專訓邊卒。部議獨用繼光。乃命以都督同知總理薊州平昌保定三鎭練兵事。尋以薊州旣有總兵官。及設總理事權不一。復召還總兵官郭琥。而以繼光爲之。鎭守薊州永平山海諸處。繼光建敵臺千二百座。臺高五丈。睥睨四達。虚中爲三層。臺宿百人。鎧仗糗糧俱備。精堅雄壯。二千里聲勢連接。又立車營。每車一輛。用四人推換。戰則結方陣。而馬步軍處其中。製拒馬器。遏冦騎。冦至。則火器先發。稍近。則步軍持拒馬器。排列面前。間以長槍筤筅。（兵器名。）寇奔。則騎兵逐北。又置輜重營隨其後。而以南兵爲先鋒。（其時邊卒木疆。律以軍法。多不堪用。繼光請募浙人爲一軍。用倡勇敢。許之。浙兵三千。陳之郊外。天大雨。自朝至日昃。植立不敢動、邊卒大駭。自是始知軍令。）八衛兵主策應。本衛兵主戌守。節制精明。器械犀利。薊門軍容。遂爲諸邊冠。</p>
<p>繼光有練兵實紀九卷。一練伍法。二練膽氣。三練耳目。四練手足。五六七八練營陣。營陣之中。又分塲操。行營。野營。戰等法。九終於練將。其經營於練兵之策者。多至二百六十餘條。皆以爲練兵計也。且恐後世將兵者不復知練兵之法。故設爲條敎。傳之簡編。立言唯恐不周。用心唯恐不盡。取法唯恐不善。因以不憚其煩也。實記外。又有練兵雜集六卷。曰儲將通論上。儲將通論下。曰將官到任。曰登壇口授。曰軍器制解。曰車步騎解。多則千奇百變。少則一物一名。計慮之周。推詳之密。其諄諄著此書者。亦以練之不得其道。病不在未練。而在練而無益。弊不在不練。而在雖練而無用。故練兵之法。古與今異。而治兵之道。今與古同。當此抗日振軍之際。倘亦一考夫勦倭戰績。而有不思戚大將軍者乎。噫、吾願將來執殳前驅以殲島夷者。胥奉爲討伐之神也。</p>

<p>— 儉父</p>
<p>林樂知者。美國之寓華敎士也。氏寓華歷四十年。與海上名士蔡爾康紫莆爲文字交。夙擅中文。甲午之役。中國之不亡者。間不容髮。其時我國民之酣夢自若也。林氏心焉憫之。思有以喚醒吾國民之迷夢。遂慫蔡氏輯中東戰紀。此書旣出。風行海内。國民始稍明暴日侵華之眞相。世多知此書出於蔡氏手筆。而不知實得力於林氏贊勷。否則蔡氏雖有犀利之筆。然恐干當世之文網。亦將緘口而結舌矣。惟伊時科舉未廢。文土競尙帖括。或愛蔡氏之摛藻。或服蔡氏議論。而獨無重視林氏者。蓋林氏之論列。往往諷喻錯出。莊諧並作。吾國人素多諱疾忌醫。此林氏之論。所以不合作下人士之心理者歟。林氏之言曰。黄種者。東亞之巨人也。論其智力。可以執全世界之牛耳。惜其人軀體。已患麻木之症。針灸而不能覺。朡割而不能知。迨其皮肉俱空。僅存心臟。雖有憬悟。亦無補矣。夫林氏之言。可謂對吾國國民。痛下鍼砭者矣。今者倭冦内侵。國壤日蹙。東北形勢。逐漸惡化。回味林氏之言。而深望國人早日憬悟。趕治麻木。勿待皮肉俱空而轉使心臟失其效用也。</p>

<p>世稱態秉三（希齡）爲鳳凰。或以爲訕謔之詞。蓋希齡爲湖南鳳凰廳人。（今改縣）所謂以地望稱。如湘鄕之於曾國藩。合肥之於李鴻章也。鳳凰地窪涇。面積小。人口稀。瘴氣瀰漫。不宜久居。清設同知一官治理。相傳罕有生還者。故署内後院。陳櫬纍纍。皆官之死於任者。人皆莫敢往。常熟朱其懿。固名士。不信浮言。請於撫藩願一試。旣之任。獲交希齡。許爲宰輔材。字以女弟。即今播名海内之其慧女士也。義寗陳右銘（寶箴）撫湘。延攬多士。倡議變法。學政徐洪甫（仁鑄）。按察使黄公度（遵憲）皆好風雅。尙維新。嘗集梁啓超唐才常及希齡爲會。創學校。訂章制。議新政。戊戍之變。諸人咸獲罪。希齡時已成進士爲庶吉士。亦褫職。後以道員留江南。爲端方所器。隨行至日本。考察憲政。趙爾巽專疏薦其才堪大用。爲言於度支部尙書載澤。時澤方以貴胄操政柄。覓希齡。奇其才。請以四品京堂充奉天財政正監理官。澤復戕達婣家鄂督瑞澂。稱希齡善於應變。澂疏薦授湖北交涉使。希齡辭不之官。乃移東三省鹽運使。清鼎革。希齡已渡海而南。日共偉人游讌無虚夕。力言民主政治之美。共和旣成。爲第一任財政總長。隨唐内閣俱去。未半諗。忽膺熱河都統。通電稱軍入。識者駭異。有謂其覬覦熱河故宫寶藏之富。營求匪伊朝夕。旣受事。頻微服入内。以膺易眞而改稱軍人。實執反對者之口。蓋是缺例與武夫。鮮任文士。後有人訴其事於政府。項城密令司法部查覆。傳聞之辭。固不足信也先是希齡解組入京。應召商組内閣。入見項城。項城笑執其手曰。子來大佳。國事付托有人。吾無憂矣。可愼選人才以備部院之任。希齡對曰。人才範圍至廣。公左右不乏房杜姚宋。希齡無似。難勝艱鉅。儻必欲希齡誤國。宜擇第二流人物。共贊開國之大業。言已。袖出一單眎項城。各部領袖。擬外交汪大燮。内務劉人熙。財政梁啟超。司法沈家本。陸軍陳宦。海軍薩鎭冰。敎育范源濂。農商張騫。交通楊度。項城覽竟。曰。此第一流人才。皆予知交。子已得諸人之諾否。希齡曰。劉沈二公司謙讓。餘都願助我。項城舉筆多更易。以紙授希齡曰。子意何如。希齡唯唯而退。迨拜命。啟超長司法。大燮長敎育。騫長農商。餘皆所易之人。及冬而解紐。自是或煤油。或河工。或賑務。浮沈督辦之名者十餘年。是非功罪。自在人間。庚午載澤卒。無以爲殮。且因産興訟。希齡亟約楊士驄楊壽柟丁乃揚輩各出資若干寢其事。復爲其子女預儲衣食敎育之費。賢於朝爲友而夕相仇者遠矣。</p>

<h3 id="c148">鄕下人又到上海（十一） <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人一眼從車窗裏望將出去，却見一排排臂上纏着紅布，腰裏掛着水烟袋盒子的吃喜酒朋友，站得整整齊齊，吹着抵抗抵抗嘸抵抗的調門，敲着不動不動眞不動的節奏，好像歡迎什麽人的樣子。</p>
<p>「對了對了！」他又自作聰明的，以爲他的想頭不差，不覺口中也嚷出來了。</p>
<p>「什麽事？你說對了對了？」帶眼鏡先生倒請敎他了。</p>
<p>「我們車子裏一定有一位新娘子，他們是來迎接新娘子來了。」鄕下人很以爲猜想得不差。</p>
<p>「呸！迎接新娘子，頂多呌一班清音細樂，吹吹打打，那裏有這樣大隊的憲兵，到車站上迎接的嗎？」帶眼鏡先生自然是一位老江湖了。</p>
<p>「原來他們都是兵嗎？我還以爲是吃喜酒朋友咧。」</p>
<p>「自然是兵哪。這吹吹打打的是軍樂隊，索性敎了你一個乖吧。」</p>
<p>「軍樂隊我怎麽不曉得。但是……」</p>
<p>「但是什麽？」</p>
<p>「但是城裏鄕紳人家討新婦，也用軍樂隊。我的業主張老太爺，他們三少爺討三少奶奶的時候，不是也用軍樂隊嗎？不過他們穿的紅衣裳，不是黄衣裳。我想還是我的話對，是來迎接新娘子的。」鄕下人好像現在的軍事家政治家一般，不肯自己認差，還要廻護其說。</p>
<p>「何以見得定是迎接新娘子的呢？」帶眼鏡先生倒也不肯讓步，一定要問出一個所以然來。</p>
<p>「我從他們的軍樂裏聽出來了。抵抗要有力量，今天晚上的新娘子，遇着了新郎官，好像弱國遇着了强國，是無抵抗了。抵抗要有準備，新娘子平日間，跳舞啊，打球啊，一點没有準備，今夜不免要吃苦了。因此他們的喇叭，吹出嘸抵抗出來。而且動也要有相當的程度，不能動的時候，是不可以亂動的，亂動是要出毛病的。所以要鎭靜，鎭靜就是不動。你聽他們的銅鼓聲音，敲出了不動不動不動。就是說與其亂動，不如不動。所以我說他們或許是來迎接新娘子的。」</p>
<p>鄕下人那種野話，人家也不去聽他，因爲火車已停了，人家推推擠擠的都要下車去了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a Bu Kui telegram, the Heilongjiang provincial capital is safe. Zhang Haipeng is continuously fighting. Zhang is supplied with new-style weapons by the Japanese side, but because they are untrained, their combat effectiveness is very weak. Under the command and pressure of the Japanese army, there are many casualties. Many of the dead were shot in the back. Because Zhang's troops are unable to fight, the Japanese army openly attacks our army. The morale of our army is very high, and they are stubbornly defending their positions.

<p>Will Invoke Article Fifteen of the Covenant to Apply Significant Pressure on Japan</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Secretariat officially and firmly announced that unless there is a need to convene the council earlier, it will reopen in Paris on the 16th. Now, all member states of the League of Nations and staff members are surprised to hear Japan's announcement that unless China recognizes the five basic points determined by Shidehara, Japan cannot withdraw its troops before November 16. People in the League of Nations said that the truth of the Northeast Incident can be seen from this. Japan initially insisted that occupying Chinese territory was necessary to protect overseas Chinese, but now it recognizes that the intention of the occupation is to implement Shidehara's five points. Japan's new position is tantamount to admitting that Japan can withdraw its troops from the Manchurian dependencies before November 16 without endangering the lives and property of overseas Chinese. Now, it is maintaining its occupation in order to realize its demands and achieve its goals. Therefore, it is expected that after the Council meeting on the 16th, it will act in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter in order to avoid being bound by unanimous consent, and it is expected that the following resolutions can be reached after the meeting: (1) The Council will solemnly declare that Japan's position violates the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (2) The Council will send a commission to investigate the truth in Liaoning and Jilin, and although Japan opposes this move, the League of Nations has the right to do so; (3) The Council will ask major countries to recall their ambassadors to Japan and use economic pressure as a last resort. (7th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chicago Tribune in Paris published a dispatch from its Geneva correspondent stating that the League of Nations will reconvene this month on the 16th and, regardless of difficulties, will apply the utmost pressure to Japan on the issue of the three northeastern provinces of China. According to the dispatch, Geneva has now begun to consider methods such as various countries recalling their ambassadors to Japan and implementing economic blockade policies. In the future, if Japan does not formally recognize the terms of troop withdrawal, the Council of the League of Nations will engage in drafting an emergency resolution to be submitted to a special session of the League of Nations Assembly to be convened at the end of this month to await disposal. (7th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is rumored that if Japan still insists on its claims regarding the Manchurian case, the League of Nations intends to consider the proposal to recall diplomatic representatives stationed in Tokyo.

<p>(Washington) As the Sino-Japanese dispute in the three eastern provinces becomes more serious, a tense atmosphere is revealed here today. U.S. President Hoover specially summoned Secretary of State Stimson to the White House for an emergency meeting, but neither of them agreed to disclose the nature and outcome of their discussions. In particular, they were unwilling to comment on whether the United States was considering joining other countries in recalling their ambassadors to Japan. However, according to State Department sources, officials in the U.S. government now believe that recalling ambassadors to exert pressure does not necessarily sever diplomatic relations between the two countries in theory. However, the U.S. President is unwilling to resort to such measures lightly until diplomatic methods have been exhausted and the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be resolved quickly and peacefully. Today, Japanese Ambassador Debuchi repeatedly stated that since the Chinese army in Nenjiang has withdrawn, there has been progress in the situation.</p>

<p>Blames Japan for Violating Promises by Japanese Army's Deep Penetration into Heilongjiang Province, Japanese Side Still Insists on the So-Called Five Basic Principles</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Briand met with Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa late tonight to discuss the latest developments in the Liaoning-Jilin incident for a long time. According to reliable sources, Briand reported to Yoshizawa that the Nenjiang Bridge on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway is 500 kilometers away from the Manchurian Railway zone where Japan is permitted to station troops by treaty. The Japanese army's march to Jiangqiao is enough to indicate its continued deep penetration into Chinese territory, which violates the promises made by the Japanese representative in Geneva. Yoshizawa reportedly replied that the Japanese army's deep penetration was due to the increasingly intense anti-Japanese boycott, and that the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway was built with Japanese funds, and Japan has an obligation to maintain the transportation on the railway. (7th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Briand also sent a letter to Japanese Representative Yoshizawa, stating that the Japanese military authorities' unauthorized seizure of the salt tax in the three eastern provinces is adding to the severity of the situation. He reminded Yoshizawa of his previous guarantees at the Council not to let the situation escalate and to withdraw troops based on the extent of the safety of Japanese residents. He requested Yoshizawa to promote peace, because peace is indispensable to achieving the level of security that Japan requires. He also said that the seizure of salt taxes is obviously not very relevant to the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, so this action is not in line with Japan's understanding of troop withdrawal. He trusted that Japan would be well aware of its obligation to find ways to prevent the situation from escalating and to report the truth about the seizure of salt taxes to the Council. He would be very pleased if the ambassador could quickly provide all useful reports so that all members of the Council could learn the truth. (7th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan still insists that the five basic principles submitted to Geneva are the basis for resolving the Manchurian case. Officials said that Japan wants China to sign an agreement containing these principles with the League of Nations as a witness, and then it will agree to negotiate the details of the troop withdrawal with China. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of Ambassador Yoshizawa's response to Briand's rebuttal of the Japanese government's statement on October 26 was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. The main points are as follows: The Japanese government agrees with Briand's opinion that the League of Nations Council resolution of September 30 is valid and hopes to withdraw its troops quickly. Although the resolution requires China to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, Japan cannot expect China to be able to maintain peace and order after the Japanese army withdraws. The Chinese authorities allow the anti-Japanese movement and do not respect treaty rights. Under these circumstances, the safety of Japanese residents does not exist at all. Now, in the Chinese representative's letter of October 24 on respecting Japan's treaty rights, the Chinese government seems to be raising the issue of the validity of the treaty. The Japanese government absolutely cannot recognize this claim. Allowing a country to question international treaties is to undermine world order. Japan's claim is nothing more than to recognize the outline of the normal relationship between China and Japan through direct negotiations. (8th Rengo News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e20">How to Understand the Tanaka Memorial (I) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The memorial of the Tanaka Giichi Cabinet of Japan, which planned an aggressive policy of aggression against our Northeast, has now become a "public secret" known to the world. Regardless of whether this extremely vicious and extremely detailed conspiracy can achieve its goals and everything goes according to plan, this plan is enough to make the entire world and all mankind fall into a state of great unease in the future, constantly feeling the threat of a tragic fact that is about to happen. There is little doubt about this.</p>
<p>In particular, China is in fact in the position of the main character in this tragedy. Every move of the ambitious military warlords and politicians in Tokyo is aimed at China. Moreover, in fact, it is enough to make China immediately feel the pain. The Tanaka Memorial states, "If you want to conquer China, you must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If you want to conquer the world, you must first conquer China. This is the legacy of the Meiji Emperor, and it is also necessary for the survival of our Japanese Empire." How aggressive are these words? They make people shudder and at the same time allow us to understand the establishment of the so-called aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia. Our country is in the position of being directly impacted, suffering the consequences before the world. Therefore, people around the world must not ignore the Tanaka Memorial, and our people should have a deep understanding of this extremely vicious conspiracy that is related to life and death.</p>
<p>Before understanding Tanaka's vicious conspiracy, we should have several basic concepts, that is, to grasp the "factors" of the Japanese imperialists' external aggression, especially in recent years, focusing on the northward advancement and development towards the mainland, from the national power and environment of the Japanese imperialists. Because all phenomena in the universe are not accidental. In the extremely complex pile of interconnected facts, we can definitely find the thread of "why this is so," that is, all phenomena must be "governed by the law of cause and effect."</p>
<p>Why do Japanese imperialists want to actively engage in external aggression? How did Tanaka Giichi's aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia come about? Let us first introduce what Thomas Moon, a professor at Columbia University in the United States, said in his book Imperialism and World Politics about "Japanese Imperialism" to explain.</p>
<p>"...The common reasons for defending Japanese imperialism... (1) Japan has a problem of "overpopulation" and must find a place to settle. Japan's population is relatively dense. On the whole, they all have a fear of poverty. This is true. But it is clear that the land annexed by Japan cannot be a place for Japan's overpopulation to settle. If Japanese people are not allowed to immigrate to the United States, Canada, and Australia, they are still willing to live in Japan. Because wages are high and it is easy to make money in these places, they are willing to go. Therefore, "overpopulation" cannot be a major reason for Japanese imperialism. (2) Japan needs raw materials and food, especially rice, iron, and coal. This is also true. However, this is the same for any industrial country, and the focus of the question is whether a country should buy the raw materials it needs or annex the country that produces the raw materials... "The real reason for Japanese imperialism is mostly still the profit-seeking heart of Japanese capitalists and the aggressive desires of the military warlords... Since the Meiji Restoration in 1867, a group of military leaders from the Choshu and Satsuma clans have emerged and hold great power in the Japanese government. When they estimate the interests of the army and navy, the Japanese constitution and parliament are just masks. Japanese warlords want to conquer and observe the situation in the Far East entirely from a military strategic perspective..."</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the evening of the 8th, at 10:00 p.m., over a thousand vagrants gathered in Penglai Street in the Japanese Concession and went straight to Haiguang Temple, obtained rifles, ammunition, and armored vehicles, crossed Qiangzi River, and attacked the Second District and Second Precinct. Gunfire resounded like boiling water. The gunfire stopped after about twenty minutes. After 11:00 p.m., machine gunfire erupted. Traffic to the Japanese and French concessions was cut off. French concession armored vehicles were on guard at the West Gate and the Old Iron Bridge. Gunfire broke out at 11:30 p.m. A regiment of infantry was transferred from Junliangcheng at 10:30 p.m. and joined the guard. It is said that the thousand-odd people departing from Haiguang were going to rob the Public Security Bureau, the provincial government, and the municipal government. This was instigated by the Japanese. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

Another saying is that a certain faction colluded with Japan, using the name of the Hebei Provincial Security Maintenance Association, to change the political situation in the manner of Liaoning and Jilin. However, the current authorities have preempted them, and it is thought that the riots will be a failure. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>British Newspaper Reporter Deeply Worried</p>
<p>◎London. The Manchurian incident has had a backlash on the issue of disarmament. Generally, it is felt that if the League of Nations cannot satisfactorily resolve the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute, then the disarmament conference to be held in February next year will be seriously affected as a result. Today, London's famous weekly publications, The Observer and The Sunday Times, both expressed this fear. Stead, a former reporter for The Times of London and an expert on international affairs, wrote an article published in today's The Sunday Times, saying that if the League of Nations cannot firmly reject Japan's demands for a military solution to the Manchurian case, then supporters of the League of Nations will no longer have any trust in the League of Nations, and the disarmament conference next year will be a complete failure.

<h3 id="e23">League of Nations Secretary-General Releases Sino-Japanese Documents <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangqiao Incident Clearly a Premeditated Step by Japan, Detention of Salt Tax; Japanese Representative Still Makes Unreasonable Arguments</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond today released a document submitted by Dr. Shi Zhaoji, stating that Japan's policy is to expel the legitimate government of the three eastern provinces and replace it with groups controlled by the Japanese. The central government considers the current Nenjiang war to be part of Japan's policy. The Secretary-General also released correspondence between Briand and Yoshizawa regarding the Japanese seizure of the Liaoning salt tax. While the League of Nations is examining these documents, news has arrived from Helsingfors stating that several groups of Russian soldiers have recently moved from their garrisons in northern Russia to other locations. Their destination is unknown, but the Russian soldiers themselves claim they are heading to Manchuria. Although news from Moscow and Riga yesterday stated that Russian leaders Voroshilov and Molotov both said that Russia's policy in Manchuria is non-interference, the news from Helsingfors has caused panic, fearing that the Manchurian issue will soon become a triangular affair. Today, Dr. Shi's document, in addition to stating that Japan's troop deployment at Jiangqiao is part of Japan's policy of expelling legitimate Chinese officials from Manchuria and replacing them with Japanese puppets, also details how the Japanese supported Zhang HaiPeng's troops, who declared independence in Taonan, to invade northern Manchuria and attack the legitimate government of Heilongjiang province. It also stated that the Japanese claim to be repairing the bridge, but in reality, they are aiding the rebels. Not only is there no need for artillery, infantry, artillery shells, and aircraft to assist in repairing the bridge, but the Japanese military authorities insist on using this bizarre method to repair the Jiangqiao bridge, which also violates the agreement between the Heilongjiang government and the Japanese consul in Qiqihar, as Ma Zhanshan has already taken responsibility for repairing the bridge himself. Japan's policy is to deny the advice of the Administrative Council and not fulfill its</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>repeated promises not to take any actions that would aggravate the situation or escalate the dispute. Other documents released by the League of Nations Secretary-General include a telegram from Tokyo on the 6th from Japanese representative Sawada, claiming that half of the Japanese troops stationed at Juliuhe and more than half of the Japanese troops stationed in various locations in Jilin have been withdrawn. The Japanese troops currently in the area, including the railway guards, number less than one thousand. Another document is a letter from Briand to Yoshizawa on November 5, concerning the Japanese seizure of the Niuzhuang salt tax. Briand recalled that the Japanese government had undertaken to adopt all necessary measures not to exacerbate or aggravate the situation, as stated in the Administrative Council's resolution of September 30, and Yoshizawa's repeated formal declarations at the Administrative Council meetings of October 23 and 24 that the Japanese government intended to withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian Railway area as soon as the safety of Japanese lives and the protection of their property were fully guaranteed. Briand stated that aggressive acts such as the seizure of the salt tax were clearly unrelated to the safety of Japanese lives and the protection of their property. Therefore, such actions contradicted the assurances given to the Administrative Council and the voluntary statements recorded by the Administrative Council. "I am confident that the Japanese government is aware of its obligation to take all necessary measures to prevent the situation from becoming more serious, and understands the need to provide the Administrative Council with the necessary information on this matter." Yoshizawa's reply on the 6th included a telegram from the Japanese government denying the Chinese claim that the Japanese military seized the salt tax. Yoshizawa stated that this statement was groundless, because on October 22, the Shenyang Public Security Maintenance Association requested the staff of the Niuzhuang Salt Tax Inspection Office to hand over the remaining tax revenue, and the staff agreed to hand over the existing balance and subsequent net revenue. The Japanese military authorities did not interfere in purely internal affairs, and believed that there was no reason to oppose the Niuzhuang Chinese Public Security Maintenance Association's request. It was found that the Niuzhuang salt surplus had previously been collected by Zhang Xueliang, and now the Maintenance Association is acting on behalf of Zhang Xueliang to maintain public order. Although the Niuzhuang Salt Tax Inspection Office has handed over the salt surplus to the Maintenance Association, it will still send the necessary funds to repay foreign debts to the Nanjing government. The Japanese government also stated that the salt tax inspection office is different from the customs, and has become a solely Chinese-owned enterprise, because the Chinese government reorganized it at the end of 1928 despite the protests of the countries concerned.

<h3 id="e24">Memorandum from Our Government to Briand <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Hoping to Take Effective Measures to Curb the Violent Acts of the Japanese Military</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Briand telegraphed China and Japan the day before yesterday, strongly urging that the situation not be expanded in accordance with the League of Nations resolution. Our government replied to Briand on the 7th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese government has received and read your letter. The reply is as follows. The Chinese government has consistently trusted the League of Nations to achieve a peaceful solution to this problem and thereby maintain world peace with regard to Japan's military occupation of various parts of eastern China. Therefore, it has faithfully fulfilled the obligations given by the resolution of the Executive Yuan, especially the obligation to avoid any aggressive policies or actions that may expand the situation, in order to ensure the success of the efforts of the member countries of the Executive Yuan. Unfortunately, Japan not only has no intention of fulfilling the Executive Yuan's proposals to this day, but is also vigorously expanding the scope of its military aggression. Since September 30, Japan has actively continued its illegal actions in violation of the Executive Yuan's resolution, and finally there was the bombing of Jinzhou on October 8. Since October 24, Japan has again violated the officially expressed intentions of the Executive Yuan and refused to stop its actions to expand the situation. The facts that occurred in the previous two weeks have been reported to the League of Nations Executive Yuan by the Chinese representative one by one. Recently, there was the seizure of a large amount of salt money from the Chinese government in Niuzhuang. On the 2nd of this month, a large number of Japanese troops advanced to the Nenjiang Bridge, ninety kilometers away from the capital of Heilongjiang Province, openly crossing the river to attack Chinese troops using bandits and traitors, although the Chinese troops were stationed more than ten kilometers away from the Jiangqiao Bridge, the Japanese troops still actively advanced and opened fire first, forcing the Chinese troops to take necessary self-defense measures. The situation in Heilongjiang Province is extremely tense. Japan's desire to occupy Qiqihar by force in order to overthrow the existing government in northern Eastern Province and support the traitors has been fully exposed. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the governments of all countries will send representatives to observe the truth of the facts on the spot and the evidence of Japan's violation of the resolution. The Chinese government believes that the League of Nations is the highest world organization for maintaining peace, and firmly believes that the member countries of the Executive Yuan will be able to curb Japan's aggressive acts in the most effective way permitted by the covenant, and order it to earnestly fulfill the resolution, and that your efforts as Chairman of the Executive Yuan will be successful, so that peace and justice will ultimately rely on the power of the League of Nations to achieve final victory.

<p>(Beiping) The new Northwest air route planned by the Eurasia Aviation Company will begin preparations next month because the banditry in Hami has been quelled. However, due to inconvenient transportation, success will still take time. The air route is divided into five stations, starting from Suiyuan, passing through Reshuihe, Lanzhou, and Hami, to reach Dihua, and then flying into Russia. A large amount of gasoline has been transported and stored in Reshuihe. If entering Russia, Russian oil will be used. The company's Beiping ring flight plans to suspend operations temporarily due to the cold weather and few passengers. (Special telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>▲A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 7th reports that, according to sources in Paris, Franco-German negotiations have encountered a setback. France firmly insists that reparations should resume next year and take precedence over German private debts. It is also reported that France is advocating strict limitations on the scope of investigation into Germany's financial situation by the committee of bankers dispatched by the Bank for International Settlements. Political circles claim tonight that all of this will make the issues under discussion difficult to resolve quickly or easily. It is said that the German government is eager for the committee of bankers to ascertain the total amount of German domestic and foreign debt and that the scope of the committee's investigation must be expanded as much as possible to accurately determine Germany's ability to repay its debts. If the French government does not agree to this, the committee will be greatly hindered, and the outcome may be irresolvable.</p>

<p>▲A Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 7th reports that the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Republic was grandly celebrated in Moscow, the capital. The people cheered and celebrated, presenting a scene of peace and prosperity. The effects of the Five-Year Plan and the actual expansion of industry and commerce in the past fourteen years were displayed on huge charts hanging on main streets, visible everywhere. Enormous banners of the hammer and sickle (the Soviet emblem) fluttered atop major buildings. At night, searchlights illuminated each other, creating a spectacular sight. The streets were so packed with people that traffic was cut off. All movie theaters opened their doors to the public free of charge, so those waiting outside formed long queues. Today is the last day of the celebration. The review of the parade in Red Square did not conclude until late at night. Important leaders such as Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov stood at Lenin's Tomb, reviewing the parade. No less than a million men, women, and children participated in the parade, a spectacle unprecedented. Stalin and others stood motionless, occasionally raising their hands or shouting greetings in response to the cheers from below until they were hoarse. The diplomatic corps of various countries had departed early, having dispersed after reviewing the Moscow Guard. Soviet Military Commissar Voroshilov delivered a short speech regarding the Moscow Guard, stating that while the policy of the Soviet Union strongly advocates peace, as long as the conspiracies of the imperialist countries of the world do not cease, the Soviet Union must constantly strengthen its own defense. Voroshilov's speech was met with thunderous applause, and various groups then marched past the guards. Each group carried large banners, among which the most noteworthy were "We do not want war, but not an inch of our territory will be given up," and "Revolutionary Soviet Russia will support revolutionary China," etc., expressing public opinion regarding the situation in the Far East in many ways. In addition, various illustrations were seen that mocked the League of Nations and satirized certain major politicians in Europe and Japan. Although the Soviet people expressed their views on the international situation so passionately, they were also deeply concerned about the domestic situation. There were many banners related to the Five-Year Plan, such as "Fulfill the Five-Year Plan in Four Years" and "We should use steel and iron to consolidate socialist industry." "Amidst global unemployment, we are still working every day" were all eye-catching. The subsequent display of various manufactured goods, such as agricultural tools, automobiles, airships, airplanes, and various machines, proved that this was not just empty talk.</p>

It is reported that the incidents in Cyprus were instigated by the Greek National Party to promote the annexation of the island into Greek territory. Government offices were burned down.

<p>│Records of the Manchuria-Mongolia Situation Discussion Conference│</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, the Japanese government and public have paid close attention, and various sectors have held "Manchuria Situation Discussion Conferences" one after another, engaging in heated discussions and concentrating opinions in order to formulate countermeasures. In this discussion conference, we can hear all kinds of wild and fallacious arguments, which stir our emotions and make us unable to restrain ourselves. However, seeing the neglect and indifference of our country's politicians, economists, and various sectors to this problem, given the great disaster our country has suffered, makes us feel even more aggrieved and indignant. Therefore, we are translating and disclosing this to serve as a lesson for our country and to reveal that country's conspiracies and ambitions regarding this issue. (Translator's Note)</p>
<p>(1) Convened by the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun</p>
<p>The current Manchuria problem has made Sino-Japanese relations increasingly critical. This is an event of the utmost concern to the entire population. However, the most important thing is that we must recognize the essence of this event. Therefore, our company (Mainichi Shimbun) plans to hold a situation discussion conference in Japan soon. This is also something that various parties are paying close attention to. It began at 3:00 PM on the 23rd of this month (October) on the upper floor of our company.

<p>▲If You Have Strength, There's Nothing to Fear from the League of Nations</p>
<p>Chairman Takayanagi's Remarks on the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>The Manchuria problem has been brought to the League of Nations. There are advantages and disadvantages for Japan in this. But if the strength we have prepared can be fully utilized, there is nothing to fear. We should recognize that the Manchuria problem and the anti-Japanese boycott movement are one and the same. This problem arose because Japan has special rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia, which are resented. The anti-Japanese movement is now in its ninth iteration. Two of them were before 1915, and there have been seven since. China's resistance to Japanese goods is a non-violent act of hostility towards Japan. Therefore, we should recognize that the Manchuria problem and the anti-Japanese movement are one and the same. I think this problem should be discussed sequentially in five points: (1) the method of resolving this problem, (2) the problem of Manchuria's independence, (3) its relationship with the League of Nations, (4) its economic possibilities, and (5) the problem of boycotting Japanese goods. Based on the above five points, let's first have Mr. Karemate from Changchun speak about how Japan is being subjected to Chinese oppression in Manchuria and how we hope to resolve it.</p>
<p>▲The Road to Resolution: Representative Karemate from Changchun</p>
<p>The current state of Manchuria truly makes us feel difficult. Due to time constraints, I cannot explain this problem in great detail, but I will give a simple account and state what is the method of resolving this problem. I have lived in Manchuria for twenty-seven years. During this time, the problems that have arisen every year have been caused by the failure to fulfill treaties. Regarding the method of resolution, there are various different arguments. Some even say that they are not afraid to start a war with the Soviet Union or the United States. However, I think we should regard the four northeastern provinces as an independent Chinese regime and make it an entity for diplomatic negotiations. Our country can negotiate directly with it without having to negotiate with the Nanjing government. Or some people advocate that the four northeastern provinces should be completely opened up, becoming a peaceful area without a single soldier stationed there. If that were the case, then the Japanese would no longer have the possibility of development. The individual strength of the Chinese seems like a grain of sand, while the collective strength of the Japanese is like a piece of cement. This is what we often feel. Moreover, every Chinese person innately knows the daily exchange rates for remittances in detail. Japanese people can never compare to this. Therefore, even in a peaceful environment, Japanese people will lack the potential for development. Therefore, I think Manchuria should establish a new regime and not negotiate with the Nanjing government. This is the main point of liberation negotiations.</p>
<p>▲What Hasn't Been Swallowed in Ten Years is Now Swallowed in One Go: The Ardent Debate of Old Man Sohou</p>
<p>My position is different from that of the industrialists, but I have always been very concerned about the Manchuria-Mongolia problem. Since the return of the Liaodong Peninsula in 1894 and 1895 and the battles of 1904 and 1905, I have been even more concerned about this problem. I have even done my humble best for the government. Marquis Komura once said, "Those who move to America should all move to Manchuria and Mongolia." This is a problem that the history of the Japanese people continues. It is impossible to guarantee that Japan will not fail. If Japan ultimately fails, then at this last moment, it will be impossible not to abandon Manchuria and Mongolia. Although this is not a temporary problem, it is now a time when we should thoroughly study it. We must constantly think about this problem at any time. The current Japan cannot take the small countries of Europe as its goal and provoke weak thoughts. That is, it is said that the current Japan is already strong and should solve this problem from the perspective of a great power. If there is a unified national opinion, there is nothing to fear from the countries of the world. The current state is just the Japanese intimidating each other. We cannot seek the goodwill of the world, especially the United States, which causes various problems, and have thoughts of yielding. That is to say, the current moment is a turning point in Japanese diplomacy. Regarding the Manchuria-Mongolia problem, young people think that it is not necessary to make careful calculations to deal with this unrelated Manchuria-Mongolia problem. It should be known that to save Korea, Manchuria should be the starting point. At the same time, as Dr. Takayanagi said, we must regard the Manchuria-Mongolia problem and the anti-Japanese boycott as one problem. We should unify national opinion and lash the government. Our country should determine the public opinion of the world. Just as we have already boarded a ship, we must thoroughly navigate it to the past. Our own concern for this problem is the most important. I hope that everyone's opinions can be consistent in order to seek a satisfactory solution. Manchuria is not China; Manchuria is Manchuria. This is what the world has already recognized, and even the Chinese themselves admit it. The Japanese people are missing the mark by not saying what they should say. We are going to swallow what hasn't been swallowed in these ten years; we will definitely swallow it now. I am very happy and feel emboldened to hear the Osaka industrialists hold a very strong argument on this issue. We are doing our best to plan national policy, and the military should bravely fight. We must have a unified national opinion so that the political strategy can be implemented. (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲Assisting Zhang Haipeng's Rebel Army in Attacking North▲Russia Increases Troops Heavily Outside Manchuria</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin reports that the Japanese army, on the pretext of repairing the Jiangqiao on the Tao'ang Road,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>plans to cover Zhang Haipeng's rebel army in another northern invasion. However, because Russian troops have recently continued to increase outside the Manchuria-Sui border, they cannot help but be apprehensive. Currently, the infantry belonging to the Domon of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army and the Mori company of the Garrison, which have arrived in Taonan, are still stationed in Taonan. According to reports, since the 30th of last month, the 17th Regiment and artillery have been traveling north along the Siping-Taonan Road from Gongzhuling to Taonan. All the employees of the entire Siping-Taonan Road have now been replaced by Japanese. Today, the military agency here received a telegram from Qiqihar stating that the Japanese army is forcing Zhang Haipeng's army to act as the vanguard and attack Longsha. Zhang arrived in Tailai Town on the 31st, but, intimidated by the elite of the Black Army's Wu Brigade and the Reclamation Army, he still hesitates to advance. Russian Consul General Arlohov visited the Japanese Consul General in Harbin, Ohashi Chuichi, yesterday and spoke for a long time. It is reported that the Russian Consul explained the troop deployment on the Manchuria-Sui border, but in the end, he solemnly stated to the Japanese Consul, saying, "Upon the order of my government, I hope to convey to your army that since the Shenyang Incident, the Soviet Union has maintained a bystander attitude and has always adhered to a non-interference policy. Fortunately, the Japanese army has also been able to maintain the rights of a friendly nation and has not advanced into northern Manchuria. However, if the Japanese army advances north in the future, disrupting the traffic order of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union will take necessary preventative measures and take appropriate decisive actions." This very clear statement is tantamount to issuing a final warning to the Japanese side. Therefore, there is a rumor that Japanese Consul Ohashi Chuichi will return to Japan to report within a few days. The actions of the Soviet Union in the past two weeks have indeed given Japan serious pause. Japanese Embassy Counselors to Russia Amano Eiji and Teramachi Nobuto secretly returned to Japan to report a few days ago. From this, it should be known that a major upheaval has begun in the Far East situation. The Red Army's 5th Division of the Soviet Union reportedly arrived outside Manchuria on the 31st of last month and was stationed in Daowuli. Special troops such as tank units and signal corps also arrived later. The 3rd Division of the National Defense Army transferred from Chita through Manchuria to Suifenhe. Its air force headquarters moved to Daowuli, and 30 aircraft were stationed at Abagaitu on the border. On the previous day, the Chinese Eastern Railway specially allocated a train of freight cars, about 300 carriages long, to the Manchuria border. Kuznitsov, the Russian Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Harbin, Bershin, the supervisor, and Nigin, the deputy consul, were all recalled to their country on the 31st. At present, there are about 30,000 Russian infantry, artillery, and cavalry outside Manchuria, and about 20,000 outside Suifenhe. Recently, the No. 86 station outside Manchuria was changed to a main station, connecting the Trans-Baikal Railway, in order to facilitate military transportation. Judging from this tense situation, if the Japanese army arbitrarily invades the north, the Russian army will inevitably occupy all parts of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It will be difficult to avoid a war. It is reported that Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Black Province, has stated to the Russian Consul in Heiyuan, Mikhailov, that if Zhang Haipeng's rebel army invades the north, it will not be difficult for us to pacify it. There is no need to worry about the Chinese Eastern Railway, and we hope that the Russian side will remain calm and not lightly advance troops, so as not to cause a war in the Far East. On the other hand, Ma has allocated 50,000 yuan to the Tao'ang Road Bureau to repair Jiangqiao within a week, as an excuse for the Japanese army's northward advance. (Evening of November 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Feng Yong Leads a Delegation to Shanghai to Petition <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲The Situation of the Petition Delegation Passing Through Tianjin and Jinan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin reports that Feng Yong, President of Feng Yong University in the Northeast, after escaping to safety in Beiping, believes that the Northeast problem is becoming increasingly serious. Not only has the Japanese army not withdrawn before the 16th of this month, as resolved by the League of Nations, but it has also advanced and tried to invade the Black Province. The situation is critical. Yesterday, he led a Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Delegation of more than 600 people from Beiping to Beijing and Shanghai to petition the peace conference to quickly unite and jointly oppose foreign aggression. The train arrived at Tianjin Station at 11:15 PM. I met Mr. Feng in the car. According to the discussion, the national crisis is now urgent, and if internal unity is not achieved soon, it is equivalent to hastening our own destruction. The people of the Northeast have suffered especially deeply. Therefore, this morning, students from various universities and people's organizations who have fled from the Northeast to Beiping decided to organize a petition delegation and elected me as the commander-in-chief to go to Beijing and Shanghai to request the peace conference representatives to complete cooperation as soon as possible and jointly oppose Japan. When gathering in Beiping, Deputy Commander Zhang sent Deputy Officer Tang Guozhen to dissuade them from going south temporarily, but the students were determined to set off and persisted firmly. Then, they negotiated with Gao Jiyi, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, for vehicles. Gao declined, saying that there were no empty cars. Fortunately, the Pingpu No. 201 train departed from Beiping at 5:20 PM. The crowd decided to temporarily use this train to go south. The students went to the front of the train track to block the train from leaving, and the passengers, appreciating the patriotic enthusiasm of the delegation, voluntarily got off the train to give up their seats. This delegation's trip south is determined to achieve its goals, and any sacrifice will not be spared, etc. After Feng arrived in Tianjin, he telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang from the Tianjin Station, reporting the purpose of the petition to the south. The original text said, "Beiping Deputy Commander Zhang Junjian, Yong has been publicly elected as the commander-in-chief. The national crisis and hometown hatred cannot be refused. I hastily took office without bidding farewell, vowing to use my remaining body and humble life to fight for a glimmer of hope for my hometown, and to use my loyal heart to protect the righteousness of the country. After arriving in Beijing and Shanghai, I will report in detail. Your brother Feng Yong humbly kowtows." Then, Mr. Feng met with representatives of the Tianjin-based Northeast Refugee Students Delegation and the Japan-returned Student Delegation at the station and had a somber conversation for about an hour. Mayor Zhang Xueming also personally went to the station to meet Feng and invited the students to talk at the station, saying, "Before you gentlemen set off in Beiping, I received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang, instructing me to persuade you if your delegation passes through Tianjin. Now that you gentlemen are determined, I have nothing else to say. However, the only hope for this trip south is to take care of your health. Because the climate in the north and south is different, coupled with the anxiety of worrying about the country, please take care of yourselves for the sake of the country. Because my position is different, there are some things I want to say but cannot say. I only hope that we understand each other," etc. It is reported that the delegation's organization is divided into eleven teams, and each team is divided into groups. There is a captain for each team and a leader for each group. There are also sections for secretary, propaganda, negotiation, health affairs, and command, each responsible for its own affairs. The second team of the delegation is the Feng Yong University Volunteer Army, consisting of more than 100 men and women, all in military uniform, carrying white blankets on their backs, looking like an army. When passing through Tianjin, 50 more Northeast students requested to join the trip south. After Mr. Feng approved, the Beining Railway Bureau specially prepared two carriages to be attached to the train. The passengers who purchased tickets to Pukou along the line at the Tianjin Station last night returned all but a few foreigners' tickets and switched to today's train. The detachment required time to reattach carriages in Tianjin, only departing at 1:40 AM this morning. (November 6th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that the Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Delegation passed through Jinan on its way to Shanghai to petition the peace conference. Our city received a telegram last night, and Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie immediately led officials above the section chief level and Police Bureau Chief Wang Kairu to the station to take care of things and prepared more than 500 catties of steamed buns and thin porridge to be used for entertaining. The Jinan Station received a telegram in advance and immediately notified that no tickets for the Pingpu train would be sold today. The train was originally scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 9:00 AM this morning, but it was delayed by 3 hours and 40 minutes in Beiping last night, so it only arrived at 12:20 PM. Slogans were pasted all over the train. Fengda and the Northeast universities and middle schools' volunteer army were distributed on both sides of the train to maintain order. Fengda's male and female students were wearing military uniforms and blue cloth shoes, all militarized. The female students wore military uniforms and pistols, walked swiftly, and were especially distinctive. The students from other schools were also wearing gray uniforms, with a tragic air and a serious look, and the order was in good shape. Then, the Director of Public Relations, Wang Huayi, and the Commander-in-Chief, Feng Yong, got off the train and spoke with Mayor Wen, Bureau Chief Wang, and newspaper reporters separately. Wang Huayi said that the purpose of the Northeast Petition Delegation's trip to the Shanghai Peace Conference, not to Nanjing, is because the situation in the Northeast is so serious that tens of millions of people have fallen into the abyss. The key to survival is imminent, but the Shanghai conference has not yet reached an agreement, and there is still no consensus on external affairs. How can the Northeast be rescued? There are three purposes for this trip: (1) to promote the completion of the peace conference, (2) to immediately realize a unified government, and (3) to urge the Party and state officials to eliminate their prejudices and determine a foreign policy. As for the organizational aspect, there are a total of twelve teams, each with ten groups, and each group with ten people, for a total of 1,200 people. The highest-level cadres are the command department, with twelve commanders and one commander-in-chief, which Mr. Feng Yong will serve. The affairs are divided into six groups: public relations, propaganda, affairs, health, supervision, and secretariat. The participants are all from the Northeast, mostly students, as well as representatives from various agencies and organizations, and farmers, workers, and merchants. There are more than 100 women. This trip will only return if the Shanghai conference succeeds and hopes to reach an agreement before the 16th to jointly oppose foreign aggression and achieve Japan's goal of withdrawing troops on the 16th. It is impossible to rely on the League of Nations alone now. A unified government must be established before diplomacy can be carried out. Before departing from Beiping, we experienced many difficulties. We originally planned to board the train at 5:00 PM yesterday, but the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Gao Jiyi, refused to attach the carriages, so it did not happen. Then, after the delegation expressed that it was determined to go south no matter what, Deputy Commander Zhang first sent Deputy Officer Tang to dissuade us, and then sent Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuhan to persuade us and invited us to talk at the Prince Shuncheng's mansion, which was unanimously rejected. We arrived at the station at 8:00 PM and asked the Chinese people who had already boarded the train to give up their seats so that everyone could go south. The foreigners on the train were not moved. When we arrived in Tianjin, we received food from the authorities and much help from the press. On this trip to Shanghai, we stand on the national position, not leaning towards one faction or attacking another, only urging the Party and state officials to complete the peace conference and relieve the suffering of the people in the Northeast. If the peace conference is not successful, we will die in Shanghai and not return, etc. Next, Feng Yong said that the situation in the Northeast is roughly as reported in the newspapers. The views I advocated have been detailed in previous telegrams, and I stand on the national position and sacrifice myself for the country. I plan to visit Chairman Chiang in Beijing and urge the Party and state leaders to sacrifice their prejudices and complete the peace conference to decide on a foreign policy. When we departed from Beiping yesterday, Deputy Commander Zhang sent people to persuade us, but because the people were excited, we could not stop. Now, most Chinese people are numb, knowing only their families and not their country. I hope that the press will do its best to awaken the Chinese people from their dreams. I have always admired Chairman Han for his frugality and hard work. China's production is very low. If we do not promote thrift, the economy will be in danger in the future. It is regrettable that I could not meet Chairman Han because he was out holding officer training, etc. The train started south at 1:10 PM. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Lu Province Government Decides to Dredge the Southern Grand Canal <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dispatching Personnel to Negotiate with Various Parties for Implementation ▲ Requesting Central Government to Allocate Disaster Relief Bonds</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Among the water disasters in Shandong, the Yellow River is the most serious, but the Southern Grand Canal's inability to discharge water has an even greater impact on the Yellow River's disasters. The Shandong Construction Department has established a Grand Canal Engineering Bureau to dredge the Southern Grand Canal. This year, the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau has been engaged in surveying and mapping, which has long been completed. The second step is how to proceed with dredging. The Construction Department believes that dredging the Southern Grand Canal requires considerable prior consultation with the Huai River Conservancy Commission and the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Recently, Kong Lingrong, Director of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau, was specially dispatched to Nanjing to carry out this matter. On the one hand, he will also study the mutual relationship in construction works with the Huai River Conservancy Commission and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, so as to avoid temporary barriers or delays in implementation. Mr. Kong has not yet returned to Jinan. The Construction Department believes that dredging the Southern Grand Canal is imperative. This year's Shandong floods are particularly severe, especially in the counties along the Southern Grand Canal. For the purpose of relieving disaster victims, benefiting the people, and eliminating harm, all should be actively carried out. However, due to the large scale of the project and the huge amount of funds required, the Shandong provincial treasury has no such capacity. At today's provincial government standing committee meeting, the Construction Department proposed that the provincial government telegraph the Central Government's Disaster Relief Committee to allocate four million yuan in disaster relief bonds, to be sold on behalf of the province. The funds received will be used for work relief to dredge the Southern Grand Canal. The proposal was approved by the provincial government. The original text of the proposal is recorded below: "It is found that the water disaster in Lu Province this year is extremely serious, and the most severely affected are the counties near the Southern Grand Canal. This Department is responsible for construction and has repeatedly advocated dredging the Southern Grand Canal and lakes. Recently, in view of the tragedy of this year's water disaster, it is even more felt that this project is an urgent plan for water conservancy construction. However, after this major disaster, with the suffering population everywhere, it is really difficult to mobilize the people to start construction. It is heard that the Central Government's Disaster Relief Committee is issuing disaster relief bonds and distributing them to various provinces to save disaster victims throughout the country. If the Southern Grand Canal project can obtain this funding, then the start of construction will be easier to proceed. It is proposed that the county government forward a telegram to the Central Government's Disaster Relief Committee on the situation of the Lu Canal awaiting treatment, requesting the allocation of four million yuan in disaster relief bonds to be sold on behalf of this province. The funds received will be used to implement work relief and dredge the Southern Grand Canal, which can not only relieve disaster victims but also eliminate floods, achieving both goals with one action. The matter is feasible. This proposal is hereby submitted for public decision." (November 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Jiangsu People Request a Prohibition on Reclamation of Reed Marshes in Luzhou <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲Preserving Reeds to Protect Dikes▲Luzhou is Not Suitable for Reclamation</p>
<p>Wei Jiahua, Su Minsheng, Huang Yuexuan, Jiang Zhongxiang, Yang Ziyuan and others, permanent members of the Jiangning Water Disaster Relief Association, presented a petition to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: "We humbly believe that the cause of natural disasters lies in human actions. The fundamental way to defend against disasters is to cultivate and protect. Since the establishment of this Association, it has been more than a month. It gathers the spirit of gentry, merchants, and organizations, and fulfills the responsibilities of the local community. Jiangning County, along the river, has reported sinking disasters everywhere. Among them, there are countless large and small dikes that have collapsed and been submerged. The members of this Association have repeatedly gone to the disaster areas to investigate the actual situation. It is roughly estimated that the loss of farmland is more than 630,000 mu, and the number of people affected by the disaster is more than 200,000. The disaster situation in the areas of the sandbar north and south dikes and Daizi Island is particularly serious. Just taking the largest sandbar dike breach as an example, it is nearly two hundred and several tens of zhang, which is truly an unprecedented catastrophe in our Ning. The cause of this is not only the high water level this time, but also the lack of flood prevention efforts at ordinary times. Dikes are for flood prevention, and the reeds outside the dikes are for protecting the dikes. In recent years, people have been misled by private gains and officials have been biased towards the benefits of reclamation. They have spared no effort to cut down and destroy the reed marshes that have protected the dikes for thousands of years, turning them into wheat fields. Although they may still pay reed taxes, they have actually become wheat fields. How much is the profit from the harvest? But once the reed beaches are gone, the shielding is completely lost. The wind and water are becoming more and more turbulent, and the dike foundations are becoming more and more loose. In the event of a year of heavy floods, it will inevitably become a swamp. If a prohibition is not imposed quickly, then the wheat fields that are currently planted will be the reclaimed land that will be released in the future. As the ancients said, 'competing with water for land,' now we are going a step further and saying, 'removing reeds to plant wheat,' which is no different from digging our own fences, drinking poisonous wine to quench our thirst. The national economy is at stake, and the people's livelihood is at stake. The relative advantages and disadvantages are more than doubled. This is the crux of the problem, which is even more obvious to everyone. The elders of the sandbar dike and Daizi Island areas have repeatedly prostrated themselves, weeping, and reporting together that after the great disaster, repairing the dike is not enough to prevent floods, and planting reeds extensively is not enough to defend the outer dikes. They implore us to forward their requests to the officials and to approve the restriction. From now on, within fifty zhang outside the dikes along the river, reeds must be preserved and reclamation must not be allowed, and this will be a permanent strict prohibition. In this way, hundreds of thousands of people's lives and homes can be guaranteed, and it will also be the ultimate intention of the late Premier to be concerned about people's livelihood, prevent disasters, and provide disaster relief, which will be forever manifested without end. We beg you to review and approve for implementation, and we are waiting for your order with utmost anxiety."</p>

<p>Ruffians Show Off Ferocity and Go to the Court to Verify Injuries. Gu Chunquan, Gu Chuntang, Jin Agui, Deng Rongbao, Chen Ating and other five ruffians in Qianzhou Town, Fifteenth District (Qingnian City), have been causing trouble for no reason and treating the villagers as fish and meat. Recently, they set up a gambling den on Wangjiatan nearby, calling on gamblers to extract profits. The other day, the chief of the Public Security Fifteenth Sub-bureau patrolled to the place and suddenly heard the sound of cards. He immediately implemented an arrest. As a result, six gamblers, including Jiang Sibao, were arrested and taken to the bureau, fined, and released. However, the boss Gu Chunquan and others believed that this arrest was caused by Shi Aming's report, so they hated him to the bone. They gathered their accomplices and beat Aming severely, causing him to be covered in injuries and lying on the ground, unable to get up. Chunquan and others saw that they had caused trouble and dispersed. After being beaten and injured, Shi Aming, in addition to seeking medical treatment, also came to the city yesterday (8th) to go to the county court procuratorate to verify the injuries and request the arrest of the perpetrators for legal action.</p>
<p>Confiscated Enemy Goods Handled and Appraised. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of various circles in this county held an executive committee meeting at 3 pm yesterday (8th) to resolve cases. One was that the confiscated enemy goods have been identified and confirmed, and Committee Member Xu Hanqing was responsible for handling the appraisal matters in order to implement the matter. One was that Yisheng Silk Store sent a letter requesting lenient punishment, which was difficult to approve. One was that the Yixing County Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting that when verifying, non-enemy goods should be stamped with a "Verified" mark so that the goods would not cause further complications when they arrived in Yixing. It was decided that all goods identified and returned would be allowed to be stamped and replied for verification. One was that Xiangyu Silk and Cloth Store was found to have Japanese goods such as velvet after registration and was dealt with according to regulations. One was that Director Shi Qinglin of the Identification Committee and Director Xu Hanqing of the Custody Department reported the results of the identification and were dealt with according to regulations. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Careless Examination and Request for Re-examination. Wu Pu, a rural woman from Wujiali Village, Tu 421, Eleventh District of the county, was previously beaten by her clansman Wu Aer and others. She reported to the procuratorate to verify the injuries. Unexpectedly, almost a month later, Pu suddenly died. Her daughter-in-law, Wu Li, reported to the court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Du went to the countryside on the 4th of this month to conduct an autopsy on file. Last night, Wu Li filed a petition with the procuratorate requesting the dispatch of personnel for a re-examination, and pointed out that the previous autopsy was careless. I wonder how Chief Zhou will handle it.</p>

<p>Killing a Notorious Bandit Yichi Tou, a notorious bandit in Beixiang, Wuyi County (namely Qi Renfu), has been wanted by the county government for a long time, but has not been arrested. The bandit recently gathered his accomplices to hold a meeting at Caojiaba near Baizhang Town in the Fourth District, secretly plotting wrongdoing. The matter was detected by Chen Tianxi, captain of the Second Police Squad, who immediately dispatched Squad Leader Guo to lead the police to surround Caojiaba on the 7th. As expected, bandits came out to resist arrest. Yichi Tou fired a gun. After the police team returned fire, Yichi Tou was shot in the head and chest and immediately fell to the ground and died. A White Langlin pistol was found on his body, and eight of his accomplices were captured and secretly taken to Guotangqiao Town for further reporting to the county government and county court for verification.</p>
<p>A Kidnapping Case Occurred in the Fourth District. Several bandits suddenly came to the home of Rui Fusheng in Huaiyong Township, Fourth District, Wuyi County, the other night, climbed over the wall and entered the room, kidnapped Rui Fusheng, and went north over the railway.</p>

<p>Zhang Qian's Property Actually Returned. The arrest warrant for Zhang Qian in this county has been cancelled. All the properties that have been sealed in Nantong and Dongtai are now being returned. The county government received an instruction from the Department of Civil Affairs, saying, "In order to obey orders, in the case of Zhang Qian in Nantong, the Executive Yuan has now issued an instruction to cancel the arrest warrant. The original case of confiscation of property as decided by the 57th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee should be revoked accordingly. In addition to ordering the Department of Education to be informed, the Department is hereby ordered to forward it to the county magistrate for compliance, return the previously sealed property of Zhang Qian, obtain a receipt, and submit a detailed inventory for inspection and transfer without any delay."</p>

<p>Sanheba Has a Dike Built. Sanheba is the throat of the Huai River's return to the Yangtze River. The Construction Department previously telegraphed the Huai River Conservancy Commission to build a dike. It is now heard that the Anhui Construction Department has appointed Wu Jichun to go to Sanheba to strictly urge the construction of the dike. The right to manage the dike has been striven for by the Jiangsu provincial water conservancy authorities for many years without achieving their goal. The authority is not in their hands, so the opening and closing cannot be done on time. This is also a major problem in Jiangsu's water conservancy.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Huanhu Road Project. The Huanhu Road runs from Yixing through Wuxi, Wu County, Wujiang, and directly to Nanxun Town on the Zhejiang border, with a total length of 205 kilometers. The Xixun section is about 146 li long (the estimated cost of the entire section is about 2 million yuan). The Xiyi section is about 59 kilometers long. The earth base of the Xiyi section and part of the Xixun section has been built for about 84 kilometers in total. There are a total of 181 bridges and 535 culverts on the entire Huanhu Road. The counties through which the route passes have successively built 55 completed bridges and 210 culverts. The former director of the road, Yu Heng, was transferred to the blocking work and could not take care of both. He has now been replaced by Yu Wei, the director of the Shijuyi section of the Provincial Juyi Road, who was transferred from the department.</p>
<p>Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Extended to Jiangyin. The Jiangsu provincial long-distance telephone was initially used for calls between Zhenjiang, Jurong, Lishui and other nine counties in the nineteenth year. Wuxi and Suzhou were connected in January of the twentieth year. Changshu was connected this month. Now, the telephone has been extended to Jiangyin. The line runs from the Wuxi exchange to the north and west, passing through Qinxiang and Qingyang to reach Jiangyin County, which is about 80 li long. The project is estimated to cost about 16,630 yuan. The funds were allocated by the Construction Bonds Supervision and Use Committee under the long-distance telephone fee item. The management of long-distance telephones used to belong to the Electrical Management Office, but now the office has been abolished and changed to the Fourth Section of the Construction Department. It is heard that the materials needed for the Jiangyin line have been prepared, the team leader is Li Xia, and the entire team has more than 40 employees. They will set off soon to start laying the line.</p>

<p>Director Zhu Dismissed and Investigated. The director of Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, Zhu Ying, was discovered by Chief Liang to have had his bureau members, Yuan Xuepu, induce the purchase of firearms from the garrison. He was telegraphed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Pacification Superintendent's Office of this province. The county was also instructed to place Zhu under supervision. It has been ten days since the incident. Now, Inspector Wu Xie from the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs was specially dispatched to Pubei to investigate the matter. Wu arrived in Pu on the 3rd and first went to the county government to investigate everything. According to his words to others, the department had already dismissed Zhu and ordered him to await investigation. Shen Shi has been appointed as the acting director of Huaiyin Public Security Bureau and is expected to arrive in Huaiyin to take over the matter around the 6th.</p>
<p>The Ending of the Three Industries' Market Stoppage. The cloth, general merchandise, and miscellaneous goods industries in Huaiyin stopped the market due to the stagnation of finance. After the party and government mediated, the market reopened on the 2nd of this month after a delay of five days. However, regarding the method of activating finance, there was a saying of mortgaging Japanese goods to various Qian Zhuang (money shops), so yesterday (3rd) at 3 pm, County Chief He, Party Secretary Qian, Chamber of Commerce Standing Committee Member Dai, and representatives of the three industries, Wu Ganqing, Meng Zizhang, Mao Shaoping, Chen Yanling, Qian Industry Guild Standing Committee Member Zhang Runsheng and others, discussed the matter at the county government. As a result, the cloth industry borrowed 60,000 yuan, the general merchandise industry borrowed 5,000 yuan, and the miscellaneous goods industry borrowed 5,000 yuan. Each mediator provided a guarantee for a period of 50 days with a monthly interest rate of 1.3%. The loan agreement was agreed upon.</p>

<p>Measures to Eliminate Bandits on the Borders of Three Provinces. Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces are located adjacent to each other. All bandits on the borders easily evade thorough resolution due to the provincial boundary relationship by fleeing from one to the other. Recently, the Changxing Coal Mine Bureau was robbed, and bandits from Jiangxi Province invaded Huabu in Zhejiang Province on a large scale. It is not possible to be successful unless the three provinces jointly suppress them. The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a telegram from the headquarters yesterday, specially appointing Li Mingyang, director of the Security Office of Jiangsu Province, as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces, and Zhang Yineng, commander of the Fourth Regiment, as the commander of bandit suppression in the Liyang Yixing area. Shen Guocheng, commander of the Seventh Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade, will concurrently serve as the commander of bandit suppression in the Changxing Anji area, and Xu Guoting, commander of the Anhui Provincial Security Brigade, will concurrently serve as the commander of bandit suppression in the Guangde Jianping area. All bandit suppression matters in the three provinces will be fully commanded by Li Mingyang, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression. All bandit gangs on the borders of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces must be completely eliminated within one month to maintain the safety of the people.</p>

<p>▲ Li Ximou Requests to Resign Due to Improper Supervision ▲ Zhao Zhiyou Visits the President and is in Mediation</p>
<p>Shao Feizi, president of National Zhejiang University, resigned from the Ministry of Education on the same day after a conflict with students of the Engineering College who petitioned for the issuance of military training fees. He was quickly dispatched to replace him. Yesterday, he submitted a detailed report to the Ministry of Education. Now, Li Ximou, president of the Engineering College, has also requested to resign due to self-reproach. The affairs of the college are handled by Li Shouheng, director of academic affairs. Professors of the Engineering College sent a letter requesting the president to abandon his intention to resign. It is also heard that Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou volunteered to serve as a mediator. The text of Shao Feizi's report to the Ministry is recorded as follows: (Omitted above) In the middle of last month, Tan Xihong, Dean of the College of Agriculture of this university, sent a letter requesting to resign. His intention was extremely firm. Although the president and the faculty and staff of the College of Agriculture repeatedly and earnestly tried to persuade him to return to the college, he did not agree. The president believed that the affairs of the school could not be stopped for a day, so he immediately discussed with Xu Xuan, the former director of academic affairs of the college, to succeed as the dean, and invited the directors of the various departments of the college and the directors of the agricultural, forestry, and horticulture fields, as well as the associate professors in the college, to organize the college affairs committee to temporarily maintain the situation before the new dean arrived. Since the establishment of the committee, the funding issues of the college have been discussed by the committee members and handled by the president at any time. Currently, the funding of this university has not been received for January and February of this year, and the allocation from Zhejiang Province has not been received in full for June, and only 10,000 yuan was received in September. The difficult situation is beyond words. The students of the College of Agriculture, believing that the college affairs committee could not be directly responsible for the funding, came to request instructions on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. The president immediately summoned the students to talk in the auditorium. (Omitted in the middle) While explaining, students from the First and Second Battalions of the Engineering College Student Volunteer Army suddenly entered the meeting place. At first, they were sitting in the audience. Later, the president temporarily left the meeting due to some matter and talked with the professors of the College of Agriculture. Several students from the Engineering College also left the meeting and came to request a separate conversation with the president. The president immediately allowed them. At that time, the professors of the College of Agriculture did not hear the president's reply to the students. They instructed the students to talk to the president after the students of the College of Agriculture had left, but the students said that the professors of the College of Agriculture should not interfere. They then used the organization of the Student Volunteer Army to request the battalion commander to immediately expel the professors of the College of Agriculture, and said not to let the president escape. The president was angry at the students' deliberate insult to the teachers, and scolded them. The students immediately shouted and attacked. The students of the college in the venue also swarmed in. The president and Dean Li of the Engineering College were unable to stop them. The president was then crowded into the office by several professors of the College of Agriculture, hoping that the students would regain their reason and then guide them. However, the students surrounded the office again and sent a team to guard the telephone, as if facing a major enemy. They supported Dean Li and prevented him from interfering. Then the students broke the glass bolt of the office door and rushed in to reason with the president. It was obvious that they intended to stir up trouble. At this point, the president knew that it was impossible to reason with them and that it was impossible to maintain the situation any longer, so he immediately announced his resignation. The students then deliberated for a long time before shouting slogans and retreating. This is the actual situation of the turmoil. Omitted below.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education approved the letter from the Central Training Department, stating that schools at all levels should add temporary extracurricular lectures for several hours each week, specifically lecturing on the history of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. In addition to notifying the national colleges and universities above the specialist level and the Weihaiwei Management Office, it also ordered the education halls and bureaus of each province and city to say, "The Central Executive Committee Training Department's letter No. 18097 opened, 'Since the September 18th Incident in the three northeastern provinces, the executive committees of Shanxi Province, Nanjing Special City, etc., and the Jinpu Railway Party Affairs Reorganization Committee have repeatedly submitted suggestions that schools at all levels should add lectures on the history of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China or suspend classes for a week and change the lectures to the causes, current situation, and countermeasures that the people of the country should have for this national humiliation. Japanese imperialism is plotting to invade me and wants to avenge its shame. It is not possible to be successful unless we start with education. However, the curriculum and teaching time of schools at all levels have regulations. If we add courses in the middle, it is inconvenient. In order to meet the current needs, it seems feasible to add temporary extracurricular lectures on the history of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. However, there is no need to suspend classes for lectures. In addition to replying separately, please inform the schools at all levels under your jurisdiction to follow these instructions.' The Ministry of Education has issued an urgent order to the schools under its jurisdiction to follow these instructions."</p>

Due to other reasons, some committee members present did not express their opinions, but it is a pity that some people were responsible for administrative responsibility and should have expressed their opinions, but they sat silently for a long time without saying a word. The chairman then submitted Qian Changzhao's letter of resignation as auditor for discussion, and Gu Yinting was publicly elected to succeed him. Committee Member Wang also resigned from his position as a committee member due to the fact that he was not a middle school principal. The time issue will be discussed next time.

<h3 id="e80">Private Elementary School Teachers and Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>On November 8th, teachers and students from all private elementary schools in Shanghai held a joint anti-Japanese national salvation congress at the Public Recreation Ground. Starting from 7 a.m., teachers and students from various elementary schools continuously flocked to the venue, their spirits high and order well-maintained. Over one hundred organizations attended, and representatives from the Municipal Education Bureau and other departments came to provide guidance. There were more than 5,000 attendees. Scouts from schools such as Moore Memorial Church, Shanghai Middle School, Municipal South, De Run, and China Industrial maintained order at the venue. The Public Security Bureau dispatched a large police team to oversee the event. The meeting commenced around 10 a.m. The presidium consisted of representatives from Municipal South, Cheng Zhong, Hui Qun, and Guo Ren. The master of ceremonies was from Shi Guang, the recorder from Shanghai Academy, the general commander from Municipal South, commanders from Hu Nan, De Run, and Ai Qun, and the disciplinary team from Shanghai Junior Xiehe. The reception was handled by Yin Jiang, at the request of Qiang Hua, demonstrating great enthusiasm. First, Song Yuntao from Municipal South reported the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the association, covering (1) the history of Japanese aggression against our country, (2) the fact that private elementary schools did not want to lag behind in anti-Japanese national salvation, hence the organization of this association, and (3) given the urgency of foreign aggression, this congress was specially convened to expand publicity. Next, a representative from the Municipal Education Bureau, Mr. Yang, delivered a speech, followed by speeches from celebrities from various organizations, all of which were heartfelt. Students from Ai Qun Girls' Middle School Attached Elementary School and other schools gave speeches on stage, their language pure and receiving much applause, which was sufficient to promote the public's determination to resist Japan and save the country. Finally, Cheng Zuxin from Hui Qun read the proposals of the congress, which were unanimously passed, including (1) that this association send a telegram urging the Nanjing-Guangdong sides to cooperate sincerely and quickly save the country (telegram recorded below), (2) requesting the peace conference representatives to quickly decide on a declaration of war against Japan, (3) that private elementary schools unite to organize volunteer troops to go to the country's aid, and (4) implementing a complete economic severance of relations with Japan. After the meeting, there were originally plans for a full parade, but due to the current situation, it was temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>▲Telegram Urging Nanjing-Guangdong Cooperation to Quickly Rescue the Nation. The Republic of China is unfortunate, with disasters and turmoil following one after another for the past twenty years. Tracing the origin of the disaster, it is actually due to the failure of the advanced members of the party and state to cooperate, which led to this. The Japanese pirates were able to take advantage of the situation, which is painful to speak of. Can they not feel ashamed? Fortunately, both Nanjing and Guangdong sides have jointly awakened and each sent representatives to gather in Shanghai, full of hope for peace and with unification in sight, so the national crisis can be saved. Who knew that after only a few days, various obstacles arose, and discussions were repeatedly suspended? The future is difficult to predict, but the public's anxiety is increasing day by day. This association, in view of the daily worsening of the current situation and the increasing urgency of the brutal Japanese aggression, convened the All-Shanghai Private Elementary School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress at the Public Recreation Ground today (November 8th), resolving to send a telegram requesting the Nanjing and Guangdong sides to cooperate sincerely and quickly save the country, and resolving to abide by all resolutions of the peace conference, with no one allowed to undermine them. If anyone comes out to undermine peace or obstruct the progress of the peace conference, this association will do everything in its power, for the sake of the country's future, to deal with them. This is an urgent plea, hoping everyone will work hard for the country. Respectfully submitted by the All-Shanghai Private Elementary School Teachers and Staff Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress.</p>

<p>▲Dai Linjing's Miraculous Pass│Chen Hongguang's Standard Kick</p>
<p>▲2 to 1 Sets the Outcome│15,000 People Cheer Wildly</p>
<p>The baseball field was crowded. The Tung Wah and Nanshanbao football teams competed in the first week replay of the Sco-Tu Cup yesterday. Tung Wah broke the 0 to 0 tie from the last game. In the last minute, Chen Hongguang scored a goal with a pass from Dai Linjing, eliminating Nanshanbao with a score of 2 to 1, and entering the second week.</p>
<p>▲Tung Wah Team Lineup</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Chen Pu, Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Jiaqiu, Qian Jingyong, Chen Hongguang, Dai Linjing, Li Yishen, Chen Yutian</p>
<p>▲Nanshanbao Team Lineup</p>
<p>Loran, Qi Shi, Huo Luosi, Yi Ai'er, Po Man, Bao En, Yang Ge, Xue Te'er, Fa Weike, Fu Late, Maidison</p>
<p>▲Unprecedented Crowd of 15,000 People</p>
<p>The first Sco-Tu Cup battle between Tung Wah and Nanshanbao ended in a 0 to 0 tie. Therefore, both teams worked hard and practiced even harder, determined to win. When the two heroes met again, the battle was bound to be even fiercer. Therefore, yesterday's spectators were even more numerous than last time, reaching as many as 15,000 people, so that there was no space to stand. Those who were seated also had to stand up. Even women and children stood for ninety minutes. The grand occasion can be imagined.</p>
<p>▲Firecrackers Explode as Athletes Enter</p>
<p>Ten minutes before the start of the game, Tung Wah team captain Zhou Xianyan led the entire army of soldiers to the field to fight. The sound of firecrackers suddenly rose, shaking the sky, wishing Tung Wah victory. The enthusiasm of support was evident. Zhou's red jersey was bright and eye-catching. It was said that red represents joy, which is why Tung Wah protects victory.</p>
<p>▲Tung Wah Forwards Leap Like Dragons and Tigers</p>
<p>Tung Wah's five forwards yesterday were incredibly sharp. Their cooperation in advancing and retreating was smooth and admirable, and their movements were lightning-fast. In the blink of an eye, they had reached the Nanshan army's goal. Unfortunately, they missed countless scoring opportunities. Therefore, amidst the praises, there were also some regrets. Each of the five forwards was active and impeccable. Because of the fierce attack of the forwards, Zhou Xianyan's position was not as tense as last time. Due to the fading performance of Tu Kaiyuan, the center-back line lost this central connection, and the actions before and after felt slightly exhausted.</p>
<p>▲Enemy Goal Shakes Within One Minute</p>
<p>Within one minute of contact, Tung Wah launched a full-line offensive. Tu Kaiyuan sent a long ball, Qian Jingyong dribbled straight in, Chen Hongguang passed it to the center, the center forward Dai chipped it to the right corner, Chen Yutian caught up, Chen Jiaqiu sent another kick, Dai and Li Yishen had already reached the goal. Nanshanbao's goalkeeper desperately defended, but Li Yishen missed a great opportunity, causing a burst of regret to rise from the four sides. At this time, only one minute had passed since the start of the game.</p>
<p>▲A Slanting Fly Causes Tung Wah to Lose Ground</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan then sent another ball, Qian Jingyong hooked it up, the landing point was extremely accurate, but it was still not scored. Li Yishen passed the ball to Dai, Chen Jiaqiu sent it to Yutian, Yutian flew forward and stormed in. Chen Hongguang received it and headed it, but the force was too great, and it flew over the bar. Tung Wah's momentum in the first half was extremely strong. Unexpectedly, after a fierce attack for a quarter of an hour without breaking through, Nanshan's general Bao Man intercepted the ball and sent it flying to the left corner. Xue Te'er gently waved it to the left, Yang Ge lifted his foot and shot, powerfully and accurately. The momentum was fierce, Zhou Xianyan was caught off guard, and Tung Wah conceded a goal first.</p>
<p>▲Miraculous Cooperation Leads to Enemy Goal Falling</p>
<p>Tung Wah, unintentionally falling into the enemy's trap, did not lose heart and actively attacked. Three extremely good corner kicks all proved ineffective. Tung Wah's momentum gradually showed signs of fatigue. The Nanshan army then launched an attack. Qian Jingyong was very active on the left. Once he received a ball from the center forward Dai, he was only five yards from the goal, but he hesitated slightly and missed the chance. After half an hour of fighting, Qian received the ball and quickly sent it to Zhou Dai. Chen Yutian passed it inward, Li Yishen, without deviating, shot it into the net. The cooperation was miraculous, reaching its peak. Tung Wah then created a 1 to 1 tie.</p>
<p>▲Great Luck as Penalty Kick Misses</p>
<p>Only five minutes were left before the end of the first half. Suddenly, Chen Jiaqiu violated the rules in the penalty area, and a penalty kick was awarded. The atmosphere was tense, as if a great disaster was imminent. Zhou Xianyan calmly waited for the change. Center forward Fa Weike used his skills and shot up to the upper corner, but the ball flew half an inch too high, grazed the bar, and bounced back to the left. Li Ning hurriedly rescued it. This penalty kick that did not score was Tung Wah's great luck and a sign of victory. The first half ended in a 1 to 1 tie.</p>
<p>▲Second Hit Disallowed Due to Offside</p>
<p>After a five-minute break, they switched sides and fought again. Tung Wah's momentum in the second half was as sharp as before. Qian Jingyong passed the ball to Dai, Luo Shimei missed, the center forward flew the pass to Chen Yutian, Yutian crossed the Shi Huo guard and rushed in like flying, rushed to the goal, and kicked a slanting ball, hitting the enemy's net appropriately. The referee announced that the center forward Dai was offside first, and then Chen Hongguang attacked again, but it was also disallowed due to offside. Those who regretted and resented this were all over the field.</p>
<p>▲Center Forward Ejected, Enemy Army Collapses</p>
<p>With the two disallowed, the two sides remained in a stalemate, with advances and retreats, each missing opportunities. Exhausted and tired, both showed signs of fatigue. Fifteen minutes were left before the end. The Nanshan army advanced to the Tung Wah goal. The referee blew the whistle and ordered them to retreat because the center forward was offside. This center forward, Fa Weike, was very resentful because of the failure of his success. He directly accused the referee of being unreasonable, and his behavior was out of line. The referee immediately ordered him to be sent off the field. With the main general gone, Nanshanbao's offensive power was completely lost. Thus, they collapsed, defending rather than attacking, only hoping to create another tie.</p>
<p>▲Triumph in the Last Minute</p>
<p>With Nanshanbao only defending and not attacking, Tung Wah also showed signs of fatigue. Everyone expected a tie, but who knew that狂欢 [unable to find exact translation but means wild joy/celebration] was there. With only about a minute left, Chen Yutian got the ball from the right, passed through the Shi Huo guard, and immediately whipped the horse. The center forward Dai saw that the opportunity had come and flew up to respond. Chen saw the Shi Huo guard behind him and quickly sent it to Dai. The center forward saw Luo Shimei rushing to block his progress and quickly sent it to the left. Chen Hongguang had already taken the lead. Luo Lan at this point, even if he had three heads and six arms, could only wait to die. Hong kicked it in first. Tung Wah quickly dispatched soldiers to the camp to defend tightly. Then the referee blew the whistle and announced the end. Tung Wah then advanced to the second week with a score of 2 to 1. Firecrackers filled the sky, and they dispersed in wild celebration.</p>

<p>▲Detailed Account of the Peace Conference</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, representatives from various labor unions and trade associations, as well as the Revolutionary Workers' Grand Alliance, brought a petition each to Wu's residence at 29 Gordon Road to petition. Because the preparatory meeting had ended the afternoon before yesterday, there was no meeting at Wu's residence yesterday, and the Nanjing and Guangdong representatives did not go either. Only Wang Jingwei and Wu Chaoshu were there. They received the representatives and gave a speech. The list of labor unions and Wang Wu's speech are recorded below:</p>

<p>▲Wang Wu's Speech (1) Wang Jingwei's speech: "Representatives, first I want to explain to everyone that, traditionally, the Nanjing and Guangdong representatives have been meeting here at 9 o'clock every day. Today, because yesterday's meeting has already produced results, the Nanjing representatives did not come today. Only Mr. Wu and I are here. We can give you a general report. Last night, the peace and unity conference reached a conclusion. The representatives of both sides have jointly issued a telegram reporting the process of the resolution. You may not have seen it yet, so let me briefly summarize it again. Everyone knows that the Kuomintang is divided. In the past, why did we want to overthrow the Northern Warlords? It was because the actions of the Northern Warlords violated democratic politics. If the people of the Kuomintang cannot achieve democratic politics, we cannot but work to overthrow them. Otherwise, there is no reason for it. Now all the comrades and the people of the country are suffering deeply. I personally feel the same suffering as the people. Since Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast, the people of the Northeast must be even more painful. The reason is the lack of democratic politics. Originally, the country is like a boat, and the government is just the person steering the boat. In civilized countries, if it is found that the person steering the boat is incompetent, especially in times of great wind and dangerous waves, the people have the right to replace the person steering the boat. The person steering the boat has no choice but to listen. This is the meaning of democratic politics. Recently, Nanjing felt that using soldiers internally was not a good solution. Therefore, it sent Mr. Cai, Zhang, Chen, and others as representatives. The Guangdong Extraordinary Conference also sent me and others as representatives to discuss the reform of party affairs and politics and the foreign policy. The first thing we discussed was the foreign policy. The first thing we decided was to be consistent externally. However, there is an attached explanation to external consistency.</p>
<p>In this incident in the three northeastern provinces, the border troops completely resisted, and how many places were lost in a few hours. This is not consistent. The principle of consistent policy, the Nanjing side also said, if the brutal Japanese come to invade again, we will definitely make a defensive resistance. At the same time, because the National Government in Nanjing is recognized by the international community, it was decided that Nanjing will be responsible for foreign affairs, and the negotiation policy must be jointly determined by everyone. The current approach is to ask the League of Nations to uphold justice. At the same time, we must prepare for the final determination to resist. We understand what the comrades present are enthusiastically demanding. I also have the final determination to resist. The second is the reform of the political system. For the past few years, it has been called tutelage, but in reality, it is military rule. Tutelage is different from enlightened autocracy. Tutelage is to gradually build constitutionalism. The reform of the political system is to advocate the separation of military and civilian affairs. The chairman should not have great power. If the chairman is not good, he should resign. People in civilized countries know that if others are dissatisfied with them, they will leave themselves, and they will never use cannons to bomb before leaving. As for the commander-in-chief, civilized countries do not set it up in peacetime. Even the Japanese Emperor only concurrently serves as the Grand Marshal in wartime. There is no such thing as a Commander-in-Chief of the two capitals with such high power over everything. In short, for the political reform plan, the first point is to amend the Organic Law of the National Government, so the issue of the system can be resolved. The second point is to reorganize the National Government, so the issue of people can also be resolved. Third, regarding financial issues, it was decided to establish a Financial Committee, which would include people's representatives, and give them the power to organize finances, review budgets, audit the issuance of public bonds, audit and report sales, and publish revenue and expenditure accounts. The number of committee members is three from the government and twelve from the people's representatives, so that the people have the right to review finances. The Nanjing representatives also agreed to this point. In the future, unless it is for national defense and bandit suppression, the people should never bear domestic debt. We really understand and sympathize with the burden of the people in the Southeast for the past few years. If public bonds are issued to fight wars, not only will there be no capital, but also the blood and sweat of the people will be sacrificed. If public bonds are issued for construction, then it will naturally be very beneficial. Fourth, regarding all disputes, they should be resolved by a two-thirds majority of the members present at the plenary meeting of the Central Executive Committee and a two-thirds majority of the members present voting anonymously, and not by force. Fifth, regarding party affairs, the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session, Nanjing advocated opening the meeting in Nanjing as scheduled, while Guangdong advocated holding the meeting after the government was reorganized. Now, after negotiation, the Nanjing and Guangdong sides will each hold a meeting in their respective locations. The method of generating candidates will be negotiated by both sides. All diplomatic, political, financial, military, and party proposals will be handled by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Congress. Now, representatives are being sent back to Nanjing and Guangdong to report and request approval. If both sides approve, then the internal disputes within the party for the past few years can be resolved. I think both sides can probably approve it. If the resolutions negotiated by the two sides this time can be achieved, the separation of military and civilian affairs that you all hope for can be realized. In summary, the demands of the representatives can be divided into political democratization, the military should be solely responsible for bandit suppression and national defense and should not interfere in politics, and the hope for peaceful reunification. You came early, or have not seen the reports in the newspapers, thinking that peace may not be possible, so you came to petition so enthusiastically. Now, peaceful reunification is possible. Please supervise the two sides to abide by the resolutions and further seek true unity and true peace, to resist the aggression of imperialism externally, and to achieve democratic politics internally."</p>
<p>(2) Wu Chaoshu's speech: "Mr. Wang's report has been very clear, and there is no need for me to say more in detail. However, in general, the six of us, as representatives from Guangdong to Shanghai, hold the aim that China's territorial sovereignty cannot be lost in the slightest degree externally, and to establish democratic politics internally. The negotiations at the peace conference also hold the same aim. In the future, we will continue to follow this aim to seek to implement it. Please, Shanghai citizens and the nation, urge us, and please supervise the government to realize it."</p>

<h3 id="e92">More Than Two Hundred and Sixty Associations Held Important Meetings Yesterday <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>▲Petition Beijing and Guangdong Representatives for Peace▲Telegraph Black Province Chairman to Continue Fighting</p>
<p>Shanghai News reports that more than one hundred and sixty trade associations in Shanghai, including the silk industry, mineral ash industry, lime distribution industry, mercerized cotton weaving industry, north-south goods exchange industry, southern goods industry, and sausage industry, held a meeting yesterday morning. They appointed more than one hundred representatives, including Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chenghua, Ma Shaoquan, Ye Jiaxing, and Zhu Wenqi, to visit the Beijing and Guangdong representatives and petition for peace. They first went to Wu's residence on Gordon Road, where they were received by Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaochu, and Zou Haibin. Luo Qinghua and others first presented their petition, stating that today, we represent more than one hundred and sixty trade associations in Shanghai, petitioning all of you peace representatives to quickly unite sincerely and determine a major plan to secure the country internally and resist foreign aggression. Since the violent Japanese occupied our northeastern regions, the whole country is in panic, and everyone believes that disaster is imminent. If the whole country does not unite to deal with it together, the tragic consequences of the country's demise will be far more than a simple change of dynasties like the Song and Ming. Since the advanced party-state leaders from Beijing and Guangdong came to Shanghai to discuss national affairs, the Shanghai business community felt that our country still had a glimmer of hope. However, half a month has passed without any agreement, and rumors that the two sides may break down at any time have made people even more confused, and the social economy is becoming more dangerous. Shanghai is the central region of the country's industry and commerce. If Shanghai merchants are in this dangerous situation, if the political situation is not stable, they will not be able to support it. If Shanghai's industry and commerce declare bankruptcy, the national economy will inevitably collapse. Even if the violent Japanese do not destroy us, we will destroy ourselves. Shanghai merchants are not afraid of bankruptcy, nor are they afraid of sacrificing their lives, but they ask all the advanced leaders to abandon their prejudices and unite to lead the people to save the country together, so that Shanghai merchants will go bankrupt and sacrifice themselves for the sake of resisting Japan. Otherwise, if the available popular sentiment is not used, and the good nation is allowed to become slaves to a foreign country, then Shanghai merchants really do not know where to die. Now, reading the newspaper, we know that there is already a solution for peace, and we are very happy. However, we hope to realize unification immediately, and that unification cannot be destroyed permanently in the future. All Shanghai merchants respectfully request all of you advanced party-state leaders with twelve thousand points of sincerity, holding the principle that the past cannot be advised, but the future can be pursued, leading the people of the whole country, with the determination to thoroughly correct past mistakes and strive to uplift themselves, to devote themselves to the following requests: (1) Complete peaceful unification immediately and seek sincere unity together; (2) Properly plan for the major policy toward Japan and recover the occupied territory; (3) Cultivate internal administration and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People. Now that the national crisis is imminent and time is urgent, merchants dare not clutter the ears with trivial matters. Please base yourselves on the principle of treating the symptoms in an emergency and quickly determine a way to save the emergency. In the future, the reform of all administrations, Shanghai merchants swear to follow you all and work together. We hope that all representatives will give as much guidance as possible. Then Wang responded, stating that the opinions presented will be fully accepted by the representatives. The Nanjing government is responsible for negotiations on foreign issues, because the Nanjing government is the internationally recognized government, and all principles are decided by the meeting, which can be said to be completely consistent. Internal issues will be resolved by the Fourth National Congress held simultaneously in Beijing and Guangdong, electing the fourth Central Executive Committee members. Once approved by the central party headquarters of both sides, it can be implemented. The representatives considered it satisfactory and then went to Wu Tiecheng's residence on Haig Road. Luo Qinghua and others presented the petition to Wu, and Wu, in addition to responding to each item, also stated that he would go to Beijing tonight and contribute your wishes to the central government. The representatives bid farewell and returned, immediately reporting the petition process to the representatives of various associations in the city, and resolved many important cases: (1) Publish a declaration to support peaceful unification and determine a major plan for resisting Japan; (2) Telegraph the chairman of Black Province to encourage Ma Zhanshan to continue fighting; (3) Telegraph Zhang Xueliang, the vice commander, to quickly restore the lost territory. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Wang Bailing, Director of the Volunteer Army Training, Took Office Yesterday <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>▲More Than a Thousand People Attended</p>
<p>Wang Bailing, appointed by the Central Training Directorate as the director of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Army Training Office, held a swearing-in ceremony at Labor University in Jiangwan at 9:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Qun, sent by the Central Government, and Tao Baichuan, sent by the Municipal Party Department, served as oath supervisors. Several hundred guests, including Chu Minyi, Pan Gongzhan, and Zhang Daofan, and more than a thousand representatives from the Volunteer Army of major middle schools attended. The ceremony was quite grand, and the atmosphere was solemn and tragic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲A Glimpse of the Auditorium The auditorium was located at Labor University, surrounded by five-color flags, and the Party and National flags hung high at the door, fluttering in the wind. The entrance was the signing area. Chrysanthemums were placed in front of the swearing-in platform, along with silver shields presented by Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and various circles. Zhu Yiming, the chief of the General Affairs Section, was in charge of all matters. Zhu Sanwen, Li Yongzhong, Hu Yazhou, Gong Weidao, and Lu Jingzhi served as greeters. The order was excellent, the entire venue was silent, and in the silence, there was a tragic and desolate atmosphere.</p>
<p>▲Attendees Yesterday, in addition to the Central Representative Zhang Qun, the Municipal Party Department Representative Tao Baichuan, and the two oath supervisors, there were also Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Member Zhang Daofan, General Headquarters Councilor Fan Zhengbo, Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng, Social Affairs Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan, Education Bureau Chief Xu Peihuang, Arsenal Director Song Shimao, Labor University President Wang Jingqi, Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, Shanghai University President Liu Zhanen, Law School Dean Chu Fucheng, Cultural Academy Li Peitian, Women's Relief Association Lin Kecong, Shanghai Volunteer Army Committee Members Li Cishan and Zhou Yanan, Special Zone District Court Representative Ju Zhijing, Second Special Zone District Court Representative Zhang Yong, District Court Representative Yao Yuanding, and several hundred others. The schools participating in the Volunteer Army included Jiaotong, Law and Politics, Fudan, Aurora, Zhongda, Business School, Law School, Daxia, Jinan, Chizhi, Datong, Shanghai, National Institute of Technology, Sino-French Institute of Technology, Wusong Merchant Marine, Minli, Shibei, Fisheries, Nanyang, Southeast Women's Physical Education, Renhe Midwifery, Qingxin, Huahua, Pudong, Zhengfeng, East Asia Physical Education, Xinmin, Daxia Affiliated Middle School, Huiling, Chengzhong, Liangjiang, and Wuben, among more than eighty schools, with approximately one thousand male and female volunteers.</p>
<p>▲Ceremony Procedure (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respects to the portrait of the Premier; (4) Read the Premier's will; (5) Oath supervisors take their positions; (6) Swearing-in members take their positions; (7) Swearing-in members take the oath; (8) Oath supervisors deliver instructions; (9) Guest representatives deliver speeches; (10) Training director delivers a response; (11) Ceremony concludes; (12) Photography.</p>
<p>▲Swearing-in Situation At 9:30 AM, the swearing-in ceremony began. After the military music played, Wang Bailing and the swearing-in members took their positions simultaneously and took the oath. The oath was as follows: "I swear with utmost sincerity to abide by the Premier's instructions, obey the orders of my superiors, be loyal to my duties, and defend the country. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath." Then the oath supervisors Zhang Qun and Tao Baichuan and guests Chu Minyi, Lin Kecong, and Li Zhaohuan delivered speeches (record follows). Finally, Wang delivered a response, and the meeting dispersed after photography.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Qun's Speech The Central Representative Zhang Qun delivered a speech, stating that today is the day Mr. Wang Bailing takes office as the director of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Army Training Office. On behalf of the Central Government, I am honored to be present at this grand occasion. The Central Propaganda Department also sent a telegram to me, stating that due to time constraints, they could not come and appointed me to serve as their representative, which I find very honored and joyful. Director Wang has a deep relationship with the past and revolutionary history, having gone to the Huangpu Military Academy to work hard on school affairs with Chairman Chiang, and has made a significant contribution to China's military reform, which is something we greatly admire. I and Mr. Wang have been good friends. Twenty-five years ago, when we were studying in Japan, we joined the Tongmenghui together and worked hard on our studies. At that time, I had a deep understanding of Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang has one thing in particular that is worth emulating, that is, he can conduct in-depth research on anything and achieve great success. This time, the Japanese army invaded Liaoning and Jilin, seizing our land and killing our compatriots. The national situation is at a critical juncture. Our Shanghai students have formed the Youth Volunteer Army organization. The Volunteer Army regulations were issued by the Central Training Directorate, the General Headquarters, and the Ministry of Military Affairs. Since Shanghai is strategically important and has the largest number of students, it is necessary to establish a training office. Therefore, Director Wang was sent to Shanghai to organize the training office. Mr. Wang is not only proficient in military studies but is also a backbone member of our party. Therefore, it is expected that Director Wang's training of the Youth Volunteer Army will be disciplined and scientific in terms of military and education, and will achieve great results. I am also a military man and feel that military training is different from other knowledge. Other knowledge can be studied individually, but military training must be of one mind, observe order, and abide by discipline in order to achieve good results. This is a public group life. Now that the country has reached such a state, we must sleep on our weapons and defend against Japan, and go to the national crisis together. Shanghai is at the forefront of the trend. In any case, the Volunteer Army must develop a very good atmosphere. Not only must military training be disciplined and scientific, but also the character and conduct of soldiers must be upright, so as to become a model for the time and a permanent model for hundreds of years to come, leaving a foundation for future generations and others. Then, not only can Shanghai's school history occupy a place, but also Shanghai's city history can occupy a place. If we can do this, then Japan will never dare to invade our Northeast again. Even the shame accumulated over decades can be washed away in a short period of time.</p>
<p>▲Tao Baichuan's Speech Tao Baichuan, the oath supervisor of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, stating that today, I am participating in this grand ceremony. In addition to wishing Director Wang and the Volunteer Army to achieve the goal of victory and success, I also have a small thought. Since China established the country thousands of years ago, it has always valued literature over military affairs. As the saying goes, what is gained on horseback cannot be governed on horseback. This means that the country that is not gained by military aggression cannot be governed by military force. Therefore, after the establishment of dynasties, it is necessary to stop military affairs and cultivate literature. There is also a common saying that good men do not become soldiers, and good iron is not used to make nails. This saying is even more common, and its meaning is even more obvious. It also says that others have swords, but I have pens like knives. This is enough to express our country's emphasis on literature over military affairs throughout history. Today, when foreign insults come, we adopt a policy of non-resistance, and internally, we cannot be peaceful. Internal and external pressure has created the modern social phenomenon of China. This cannot be said to be the result of valuing literature over military affairs. I remember that a Japanese scholar wrote a book called "On the Annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia," saying that there are two kinds of people in China, one is bandits, and the other is good people. All the scholars of Wenwu, Zhou Gong, Confucius, and Mencius are bandits, and the rest are good people. These good people are very indifferent to national ideology, so it doesn't matter if they are annexed. The only thing to fear is bandits. Modern bandits are young students. These people are quite fierce and have a deep understanding of national ideology and other issues. But fortunately, they can only do verbal and written propaganda and have no military force. We can conquer them by military force because these young people do not value military affairs but value literature. Therefore, it is okay to annex them. Therefore, Japan's four to fifty thousand troops can invade our China, and our China has more than two million troops, but they cannot resist Japan. Because the Japanese value military preparations, and every person has military training. If a formal war breaks out, then Japan's 60 million people are all troops, while our country's 400 million people still only have 2 million troops. It is painful to say this. This is why the Youth Volunteer Army must be organized and trained. In our old novels, it is often said that people have three heads and six arms. Now we already have two heads, namely, the pen and the tongue. If we can train the fist again, then we will have all three heads and will surely become a world power.</p>
<p>▲Chu Minyi's Speech Chu Minyi said that today is the day Director Wang takes office, and I feel that the spirit of the academic community is very scattered and must be united. Today's emphasis on literature over military affairs is an undeniable fact, but because the world is now a scientific world, guns and artillery are also based on literature. Literature studies science and then it occurs, so I hope that both literature and military affairs will be valued. Then Ms. Lin Kecong, a representative of the Women's Relief Association, and representatives of the military training department of various universities' anti-Japanese federations delivered speeches one after another.</p>
<p>▲Wang's Reply Director Wang replied that the oath supervisors, all the guests, and the representatives were all very sincere and sincerely accepted and deeply thanked for their kindness. Now, I will report on the training situation of the Volunteer Army: (1) Why was the military training office established? The Central Party Department, the Training Directorate, and the Ministry of Education consulted and believed that military training in various schools must have a responsible agency. Therefore, according to the promulgated guidelines for the implementation of the Volunteer Army, this office was established. (2) The motivation for organizing the Volunteer Army is to fight the violent Japanese with all our strength. (3) Training policy: (A) Do not hinder mine school administration (B) Respect student's will. There is a misunderstanding among people in society, that is, they think that the Volunteer Army is to fight the enemy with all their strength, which is a big mistake. The Volunteer Army is a student who has received many years of education and has rich scientific knowledge. Is it a pity to sacrifice on the battlefield as soldiers? Therefore, the Volunteer Army is the cadre to lead and train the rest of the people. Now some people are urging to issue guns. I think that the current problem of Volunteer Army training is an education problem, not a military problem. Basic knowledge must be done well before using guns. Therefore, it is not necessary to issue guns now. After the Volunteer Army is trained for six months, guns can be issued when they are trained again. It is also heard that Mr. Wang went to Beijing yesterday afternoon on the 4:30 express train to attend the Fourth National Congress and discuss military training matters.</p>

<p>The First District Party Headquarters of the Two Routes Special Party Headquarters telegraphed to the Black Province Acting Chairman Ma, stating that the Black Dragon River Acting Chairman Ma and all the front-line soldiers are well. This time, the violent Japanese have invaded for nearly two months. Our Northeast has lost thousands of miles of territory. There is no greater shame than this. Fortunately, the acting chairman has been able to effectively supervise and the soldiers have been ordered to protect themselves and increase their strength. They have resolutely resisted the enemy on the Nenjiang Bridge, winning three battles and three victories, washing away the shame of our Chinese weakness for decades. The news of the victory has been widely admired. Defending the country and saving the people, fulfilling their duties to the fullest. We hope that they will eliminate evil and annihilate the dwarf slaves, so that on the day of triumph, they will lead the masses to welcome them with food baskets. I hereby send a telegram and express my condolences. I hope you will appreciate it.

<h3 id="e95">A Record of Visiting Feng Yong <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲The Organization of the Northeast People's Group▲This Trip is Entirely Initiated by the People</p>
<p>▲Petitioning the Peace Conference Representatives Today▲The Agreed Scope Includes Four Points</p>
<p>Feng Yong, president of Feng Yong University, led a group of more than 600 people from the Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Group from Ping to Shanghai to petition the Beijing and Guangdong representatives of the Peace Conference. After arriving in Shanghai at 0:20 yesterday morning, because the Beijing and Guangdong representatives of the Peace Conference had come to a satisfactory end, it was decided that the entire group would go to the residences of the remaining Peace Representatives of both sides to petition this morning.</p>
<p>Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Group (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>At about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the team paraded around the Chinese community for a week and decided to go to Beijing tonight or tomorrow morning to petition the National Government. Yesterday, this reporter visited Feng in his hotel, Feng, wearing a western suit, overflowing with heroic spirit between his eyebrows, and chatting happily with the reporter, describing in detail the experience of being detained by the Japanese in Shenyang. He also said that the Northeast People's National Salvation Petition Group was entirely organized by the people of the Northeast, including faculty and students from Jilin, Northeast, Feng Yong, and Medical Universities, as well as staff from chambers of commerce and farmers' associations. I was temporarily elected as the commander-in-chief by the public before departure. I had no knowledge of the petition to the south beforehand. When the petition group was about to leave, Zhang Hanqing tried to dissuade them, fearing that it would cause misunderstandings in all parties, thinking that it was he who instigated it. After I strongly explained that this matter was entirely initiated by the people, please don't worry too much, and after repeated explanations, it was allowed to proceed. After arriving in Shanghai, the peace conference had come to an end. A general meeting was convened today to decide to go to the remaining peace representatives' offices in Shanghai to petition, and the scope of the petition was agreed upon, including four points: (1) Please report the process of the peace conference and the reasons for the conclusion; (2) Please indicate the foreign policy towards the Northeast decided in the peace conference and the countermeasures for Japan not withdrawing troops on the 16th, and future measures; (3) State the claims of the people of the Northeast; (4) Hope to complete unification as soon as possible and be consistent with foreign countries. It is planned to go to Beijing to petition the National Government tomorrow night or the day after tomorrow, and then return north. The reporter then asked what Mr. Feng thought of the fact that the Northeast authorities' non-resistance against Japan was deeply dissatisfied by the people of the country. Feng replied that he had made a detailed speech on this point at Peking University. I am absolutely not covering up Zhang Hanqing, but I deeply believe that this incident was caused by resistance on a daily basis. The so-called greatest resistance is the construction of railways such as the Jihai and Shenhai lines, and the creation of combined transportation to reduce freight rates, which has severely hit the South Manchuria Railway. Last year, the South Manchuria Railway laid off more than 1,000 employees due to poor business, and the loss reached 10 million yen, so they hated us deeply. Under accumulated grievances, this change occurred. If there had been no resistance on a daily basis and we had always relied on the Japanese, there would be no such thing today. Feng also said that the Northeast army is weaker in Black Province. The provincial defense army usually deploys four brigades. Two brigades were transferred into the customs during the campaign against Shi, so only two brigades remained in Black Province. The lack of supplies of ammunition and weapons, this time, the brave resistance against Japan is commendable. I believe that the Japanese army intends to extend its influence to the Taonan Road, and does not want to covet the capital of Heilongjiang Province so quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Shao Lizi Returned to Beijing Last Night <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲Definitely Know That Huang Yingbai Did Not Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>▲Recalling the Conversation on the Morning of the 4th</p>
<p>Shao Lizi went to Beijing last night. When he left, he spoke with the reporter, generally as follows: (1) Recent rumors are very bizarre, such as saying that Mr. Huang Yingbai went to Japan to secretly negotiate, but I definitely know that Mr. Huang did not leave Shanghai. He gave a lecture at Jinan University a few days ago, and tomorrow (that is, today), Mr. Huang has decided to attend a memorial week speech somewhere. This rumor will be self-defeating. It is not surprising that Japanese newspapers publish such rumors, but it is a pity that newspapers run by our own people also attack their political enemies based on such unfounded rumors. It's too unpatriotic. (2) In recent days, one or two small newspapers have accused me of insulting reporters, with severe tone and expression, which is also very strange. When I arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 4th, a reporter asked how the future of peace was. I said that it was very optimistic. A reporter said that there was a rumor that the meeting was about to break down, was it true? I said that the meeting itself was never a problem. The atmosphere outside the meeting was not good because the newspapers published various excessive remarks during the talks. At that time, Mr. Wu Tiecheng was traveling with me and also said that if the newspapers could stop publishing such talks for a few days, peace could be achieved quickly. We all talked about it as a joke at the time, but a reporter wrote down Mr. Wu's words, saying that if the newspapers could stop publishing for a few days, it was a mishearing, and the small newspapers added embellishments, saying that I insulted the reporters. I never scold people, and everyone in the news media knows it. The reporter should also be able to recall whether my tone and expression were severe at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Murder Case of Mother and Daughter in Xiaonanmen <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲Motive Appears to be Robbery of Gold Jewelry▲Tragedy Arose from Cries for Help</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM yesterday, a robbery and murder case occurred at the intersection of Gujiading on Haichao Temple South Street, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. Two people were shot and injured at the time. Passersby witnessed the scene and helped transport them to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. One of them died from severe injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital, while the other's injuries were also very critical. After investigation, it was determined that the two victims were a mother and daughter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Ding Family, A Modest Family from Pudong. Qiu, the 54-year-old wife of Ding Maomao, a native of Pudong, has a daughter named Sanlang, who is 19 years old. The family of three lives at No. 3, Lane 346, near Guohuo Road in Nanshi. They make a living by growing vegetables. Because of their diligence and thrift, they have savings in addition to their monthly expenses, making them a modest family.</p>
<p>▲Robbery Interrupted. Yesterday after lunch, Qiu and her daughter went to Xiaodongmen to buy foreign cloth. They were returning around 3:00 PM when, as they passed the intersection of Gujiading on Haichao Temple South Street outside Xiaonanmen, two thugs suddenly appeared. Both were around 30 years old, dressed in blue cloth short shirts and pants, and spoke with a Jiangbei accent. They stopped them, displayed handguns, and forbade them from making any noise. Qiu and her daughter Sanlang knew they had encountered robbers and were terrified.</p>
<p>▲Cries for Help and Gunfire. The robbers immediately grabbed Sanlang's hand because she had a gold bracelet on her wrist and a gold ring on her finger. They forcefully removed the gold bracelet and were about to take off her gold ring and earrings when Qiu and her daughter, seeing the robbers forcibly taking their jewelry, resisted regardless of the consequences and cried out for help. Realizing the situation was unfavorable, the robbers suddenly fired two shots. Qiu and her daughter cried out in agony and immediately fell to the ground. The robbers, seeing that they had committed a bloody crime, immediately fled with the stolen gold bracelet, disappearing in an instant.</p>
<p>▲Wound Locations. After the robbers had fled, Qiu and her daughter, lying in pools of blood, were on the verge of death. Qiu was shot once in the left abdomen, and the bullet had not penetrated through. Her daughter Sanlang was wounded below her left breast, and the bullet exited through her back, the bright red blood flowing from the wound. Her pale face showed a deathly pallor, a truly unbearable sight. Passersby who witnessed the scene immediately transported the injured mother and daughter, along with two bundles of foreign cloth stained with blood, to Shanghai Hospital.</p>
<p>▲The Young Woman Dies. The daughter, Sanlang, died shortly after arriving at the hospital due to her severe injuries, without receiving any treatment. Her mother, Qiu, received emergency treatment from the doctors, who said that her injuries were severe and her life was in extreme danger. Her husband, Ding Maomao, rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news. He was overwhelmed with grief at the sight of his daughter's death and his wife's injuries, nearly collapsing from sorrow.</p>
<p>▲Rumored Cause. It is rumored that Qiu and her daughter decorated themselves lavishly when they went out to buy foreign cloth. They were noticed by the robbers as they bought the cloth and returned from Xiaodongmen Street. The two robbers followed them to Gujiading, where the area was very secluded, and then they acted. Unexpectedly, the mother and daughter resisted the robbers to protect their beloved gold jewelry, which resulted in their injuries and death. Alas, how pitiful!</p>

<p>▲Change of Heart After Establishing a Relationship▲Refusing to Marry Her▲Parents-in-Law File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Liu Tingshi (also known as Xi San) and his wife Luo Mengbi, residents of No. 475, Lianbao Lane, Kangnaot Road, West Shanghai, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing their prospective son-in-law, Wang Xianggu, of the crimes of rape and abduction. They requested that he be punished according to Articles 257, Section 2, and 240, Section 1, of the Criminal Law and, in an attached civil lawsuit, requested damages of 30,000 yuan in accordance with Articles 184 and 195 of the Civil Law. The main points of their lawsuit are as follows: The defendant, Wang Xianggu, used to run a business in Yichang and had considerable influence. He was once the chairman of the Yichang Chamber of Commerce and was a member of the upper class. The plaintiff, Liu, had served as an official in Yichang twice, and that is how he came to know Wang. The plaintiff's only daughter, Liu Can (also known as Wenjin), 19 years old, also went to Yichang. Wang then asked someone to propose marriage. The plaintiff, considering him to be a businessman of the upper class, agreed. Later, the plaintiff retired and came to Shanghai, and Wang soon came to Shanghai as well. He often visited the plaintiff's home, and he and Liu Can often met. Then, on December 14th of last year, Liu Can suddenly disappeared without a trace. On the 18th, Liu Tingshi suddenly received a letter by airmail. Upon opening it, he learned that it was a letter from his beloved daughter from Hankou, stating that the defendant had tricked her into going to Hankou and raped her. After Wang achieved his purpose of defiling her, he abandoned her in an inn, disregarding everything. She asked him to come and rescue her immediately. Luo Mengbi, her mother, went to Hankou, found her daughter, and negotiated with Wang Xianggu, ordering him to marry her immediately. The wedding could take place in Yichang or Shanghai, but Wang refused. Therefore, Liu filed a lawsuit. The court approved the petition and issued a summons. However, the whereabouts of the defendant, Wang Xianggu, were unknown. Therefore, he ordered the plaintiff, Liu Tingshi, to accompany the Chinese constable Jin Wanrong, who was responsible for delivering the summons, and scheduled the trial for the 15th.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Guozhen, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Assembly in the First National Assembly, graduated from the Department of Political Science at Waseda University in Japan. Since the early years of the Republic, he served as a member of the Provisional Senate, where his eloquence caused a sensation. Every time he took the stage, the audience was packed, and both Chinese and foreign people praised him. In the election for the First National Assembly, he was re-elected. After the dissolution of the National Assembly in the Gui Chou year, the government specially sent him to England, Germany, France, Italy, and other countries to study politics. After returning to China, he held important positions and maintained integrity. Since the twelfth year of the Republic, he resigned in anger due to Cao's bribery and closed his doors to retreat, focusing on writing and studying law. Now, he has come to Shanghai from Beiping, renting an apartment on the upper floor of the Shanghai Silk Company at 656 Jing'an Temple Road, engaging in legal practice. Many prominent figures in the local banking and industrial sectors are old friends of Mr. Li and have been hosting banquets to welcome him. There is a great deal of social activity.

<p>Since the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, compatriots across the country have been striving for the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, with economic severance from Japan being the only anti-Japanese vanguard.

It is exquisitely printed on Jiangnan Lianshi paper and is about two hundred pages thick.

This aroused public anger among the industry. A temporary meeting of all member representatives was convened, and it was discussed that this number slip was different in nature from an invoice.

It was resolved to submit it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and request the Stamp Tax Bureau to allow exemption from affixing stamps in order to relieve business difficulties.

<p>(For Anti-Japanese National Salvation and Enlistment in the Army)</p>
<p>(Reply) You want to join the army to serve the country, but you are also burdened by your livelihood. It is difficult to take care of both patriotism and supporting your family. In fact, serving the country does not necessarily mean joining the army. Even in your current position, you can pledge not to buy Japanese goods and persuade your relatives and friends to resist together. One person tells ten, ten people tell a hundred... If you can truly implement the economic severance policy and persevere, it will cause great economic pain to Japan and make its people realize that the tyranny of the warlords hurts others and harms themselves. Strengthening your physique is also important. If you can gather your colleagues in the factory to form an association to exercise together, the impact will be greater.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon reading your newspaper's local news column on the 4th of this month, I was startled to see my humble name listed among the party members in the telegram to Wang and Cai. Since October 26th, I have been engaged in propaganda in various villages with the anti-Japanese national salvation rural mobile propaganda team, and only returned to Qingpu on the 5th of this month. I had no prior knowledge of this telegram. Furthermore, it is incomprehensible that the names of Chen Kui and Guo Gen, who are not party members in the entire Qingpu County, were included in the telegram at the same time. Fearing that outsiders may misunderstand, I specially write this letter to clarify the matter. I earnestly request that you promptly publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to reveal the truth. I am deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to the esteemed editor of Shen Bao, Guo Qinfu, party member of Qingpu County, November 7th.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>On November 4th, various newspapers published a telegram from Jiangsu Province Jiading County party members Lü Guanqun and others to Shanghai Peaceful Unification Conference representatives Mr. Wang and Mr. Cai, in which the names of Wu County party members Zhuang Songsheng and Tao Changhua were listed in the ending section. We had no prior knowledge of this telegram and did not sign our names to it. Therefore, we respectfully request your newspaper to promptly publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the matter. Respectfully submitted to the editorial department of Shen Bao, Zhuang Songsheng and Tao Changhua of Wu County, November 6th. To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao, Yesterday, I saw a report in the newspaper about a public telegram issued by Jiading County party members Lü Guanqun and others regarding the matter of peace and unity. In the ending section, the names of Qidong County party members Gong Sisui, Xu Zhifan, and Shi Jingheng were listed. I had no prior knowledge of this telegram, and there are no party members named Xu and Shi in our county. Therefore, I specially request your newspaper to promptly publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. I earnestly pray for your great peace. Gong Sisui, party member of Qidong County, sent on November 7th, year 20.</p>

<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>▲Wei Guangtao's Severe Interrogation of Japanese Spies</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wu Dawei, the governor of Hunan, volunteered to lead troops. Observers generally considered Wu to be overestimating himself. However, there was another reason behind this. At that time, Liu Jingtang, the first-class viscount of Hunan gentry, was a famous general who revived the country during the Red Sheep Tribulation. Angered by the arrogance of the Japanese invaders, he secretly encouraged Wu to come forward and was willing to assist him. Unexpectedly, after the memorial was submitted and approved, Liu suddenly fell ill and died. Wu was at a loss and deeply regretted his rashness. After much searching, he found Wei Guangtao, a Hunan gentry, to assist him. When the army reached Jinzhou, still far from the enemy, many disguised Japanese spies infiltrated. Every day, a strict investigation was conducted, and some were always caught. Wei personally interrogated them, resorting to excessive torture. The sight was unbearable. Wei remained calm and composed, talking and laughing leisurely. Some stubbornly refused to confess, so their toes were examined. After confirming the facts, in addition to beheading, there were also methods such as "lighting the sky lantern." For a time, people called him a living Gakuro, which was by no means an exaggeration.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Chinese Human Life <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>In the many useless words of the Pacific Conference, I heard a warning. Laul said, "China has nothing wasted, except human life!"</p>
<p>Human life! You are wasting too much in China. Old women pursue rags and rotten cotton in garbage piles, but no one cares about half-dead children starving by the roadside. Spending ten or so copper coins to hire a rickshaw puller and making him run desperately, even to the point of spitting blood and collapsing, without even looking back, one simply changes to another rickshaw and leaves. When a wife gives birth to a child, she has to hire a wet nurse. Her own child is fair and plump, while the wet nurse's child is thin and dies. A child bride who steals a piece of candy to eat is forced to hang herself by her mother-in-law. Being an apprentice is like being a slave, even having to empty the master's chamber pot. If it is not cleaned properly, a puffing pipe can crack open the head. In coal mines, one out of five people will be disabled. The Japanese come and kill hundreds at a time. A flood washes away tens of thousands. The number of people who die in a year would fill more than twenty Nanjing cities. (To be more precise, the annual death toll is more than twenty times the population of the capital.) As I write this short essay, for every word that is born, three people enter their coffins.</p>
<p>"China has nothing wasted, except human life!"</p>
<p>You must not make one-sided observations, however. When a child gets smallpox, his mother holds him in her arms for seven days and seven nights, ultimately saving his little life with outstanding perseverance and love. In this society where there is no waste but wasted lives, this great maternal love coexists. If there is a glimmer of hope, she is willing to fight for her child's life, even sacrificing her own life, and is willing to do so.</p>
<p>How can this great love and cold-blooded indifference coexist? What explanation is there for this contradictory society? If I raised him, I would love him as much as I love myself, or even more than I love myself. If I didn't raise him, even if tens of millions die, what does it have to do with me? This attitude explains this strange contradiction.</p>
<p>When will China be able to turn itself around? It will have to wait until human life is more valuable than wealth, human life is more valuable than machines, human life is more valuable than comfort, human life is more valuable than reputation, human life is more valuable than power, human life is more valuable than everything. Only when that time comes will China be able to stand up!</p>
<h3 id="e141">Writing about the Famous Ming General Qi Jiguang <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>When Japanese pirates invaded our coastal borders during the Ming Dynasty, especially in the 41st year of Jiajing, they captured Xinghua Prefecture, burning and looting everything. They then moved to Pinghai Garrison. (Established by the Ming Dynasty, the city was located east of Putian County, Xinghua Prefecture.) Since the Japanese pirates ravaged the southeast, breaking through hundreds of prefectures, counties, and garrisons, none had reached the prefectural capital. Xinghua was the first. Xinghua was a famous and prosperous prefecture. After its capture, the news shocked far and wide. An imperial decree urgently summoned Yu Dayou to be the commander-in-chief and Qi Jiguang to be his deputy to jointly suppress the pirates. At that time, Liu Xian came from Guangdong to provide aid but, with few soldiers, he fortified himself below the city walls and dared not fight. When Dayou arrived, he also did not want to attack, preferring to wait for the gathering of a large army. Thus, he and Xian separately ambushed the pirates in Changle, annihilating them. Before this, Jiguang had first defeated the Japanese pirates at Hengyu. Bringing Zhejiang soldiers to join the battle, the inspecting governor Tan Lun ordered Jiguang to command the central army, Xian the left, and Dayou the right, to jointly attack the pirates at Pinghai. Jiguang was the first to ascend the walls, followed by the left and right armies. They captured more than 2,200 heads and rescued 3,000 captured people. The Japanese pirates began to flee, and Xinghua was recaptured. Those who had invaded other prefectures and counties were also defeated by various generals. The Japanese pirates had been causing trouble for more than twenty years, attacking and breaking through cities and towns, killing and wounding officials and civilians, countless numbers. The increased transport and taxation caused unrest throughout the country. Only now, after a major defeat, did they leave. The southeast half of the country was finally able to rest in peace. Jiguang repeatedly crushed major pirates (pacifying the Japanese pirates in Zhejiang and Fujian, and also pacifying the bandits in Jiangxi), earning the title of famous general. His achievements surpassed those of Liu Xian and Yu Dayou.</p>
<p>Later, in the fifth month of the first year of Longqing, Wu Shilai, a supervising secretary, submitted a memorial stating that there were many alarms in Jizhou and requested that Dayou and Jiguang be summoned to specially train border soldiers. The Ministry discussed and decided to use Jiguang alone, ordering him to concurrently manage the training of soldiers in the three towns of Jizhou, Pingchang, and Baoding with the title of Vice Commander-in-Chief. Soon after, because Jizhou already had a commander-in-chief, and setting up a general manager would cause inconsistent authority, the original commander-in-chief Guo Hu was recalled, and Jiguang replaced him as the garrison commander of Jizhou, Yongping, Shanhai, and other places. Jiguang built 1,200 enemy watchtowers, each five zhang (approximately 16.4 meters) high, with a panoramic view in all directions. The hollow interior had three levels, accommodating one hundred soldiers. Armor, weapons, and provisions were all prepared. The two thousand li (approximately 1,000 kilometers) of interconnected watchtowers were strong and magnificent. He also established a chariot camp, with each chariot pushed and exchanged by four men. In battle, they formed a square formation with infantry and cavalry positioned in the middle. He also made anti-cavalry obstacles to deter enemy cavalry. When the enemy approached, firearms would be fired first. As they got closer, the infantry would hold anti-cavalry obstacles and arrange them in front, interspersed with long spears and wolf-brooms (types of weapons). When the enemy fled, the cavalry would pursue them. A supply train followed behind. He used southern soldiers as the vanguard. (At that time, the border soldiers were inflexible and undisciplined, and many were useless due to military law. Jiguang requested to recruit soldiers from Zhejiang to form an army, encouraging bravery. This was approved. Three thousand Zhejiang soldiers were stationed outside the city. It rained heavily from morning until dusk. They stood still and dared not move. The border soldiers were greatly shocked and only then did they understand military orders.) The soldiers of the Eight Guards were responsible for responding, while the soldiers of the home guard were responsible for defending. The discipline was precise, and the weapons were sharp. The military appearance of Jizhou became the best among all the borders.</p>
<p>Jiguang wrote nine volumes of "Practical Records of Training Soldiers": 1. Methods of Training Soldiers; 2. Training Courage; 3. Training Eyes and Ears; 4. Training Hands and Feet; 5-8. Training Camps and Formations. Within the camps and formations, he further divided them into drills, marching camps, field camps, and battle methods. 9. Concludes with Training Generals. There were more than 260 strategies for training soldiers, all aimed at training soldiers. Fearing that future generals would no longer know the methods of training soldiers, he established these articles and teachings, transmitted them in simple summaries, expressing himself carefully and with utmost dedication. He was afraid of using unsound methods and spared no effort. In addition to the "Practical Records," there were also six volumes of "Miscellaneous Collections on Training Soldiers": "General Discussion on Storing Generals" (Parts 1 and 2), "General's Arrival," "Oral Instructions on the Altar," "Explanation of Weaponry Manufacturing," and "Explanation of Chariots, Infantry, and Cavalry." There were thousands of strange and varied tactics, and even the smallest item or name was thoroughly detailed. His planning was comprehensive, and his analysis was meticulous. The reason he wrote this book with such earnestness was that if training was not done correctly, the problem was not in the lack of training, but in training without benefit. The flaw was not in not training, but in training without usefulness. Therefore, the methods of training soldiers differ from the past, but the principles of governing soldiers are the same as in the past. At this time of resisting Japan and revitalizing the army, if we also examine the war records of suppressing Japanese pirates, how could we not think of General Qi? Alas, I wish that future soldiers who lead the charge to annihilate the island barbarians would all revere him as the god of conquest.</p>

<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>Lin Lezhi was an American missionary residing in China. He lived in China for forty years and maintained a literary relationship with Cai Erkang, also known as Zipu, a famous scholar in Shanghai. He was known for his proficiency in Chinese. During the Sino-Japanese War, China's survival was hanging by a thread. At that time, the Chinese people were still sound asleep. Mr. Lin felt sorry for this and thought of a way to awaken the Chinese people from their slumber. He then persuaded Mr. Cai to compile "The Sino-Japanese War Records." After this book was published, it became popular throughout the country. The Chinese people began to understand the true nature of the Japanese invasion of China. Many people know that this book was written by Mr. Cai, but they do not know that it was actually due to Mr. Lin's assistance. Otherwise, even if Mr. Cai had a sharp pen, he would have been silenced by the literary censorship of the time. However, at that time, the imperial examination system had not been abolished, and scholars competed to write patterned essays. Some admired Mr. Cai's florid style, while others admired Mr. Cai's arguments. But no one valued Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin's arguments were often full of metaphors, combining seriousness and humor. The Chinese people have always been reluctant to admit their faults and seek medical treatment. Therefore, Mr. Lin's arguments did not resonate with the common people. Mr. Lin said, "The yellow race is the giant of East Asia. In terms of intelligence, they can hold the reins of the world. It is a pity that their bodies are suffering from numbness. Acupuncture cannot awaken them, and surgery cannot make them aware. By the time their skin and flesh are empty and only their hearts remain, even if they awaken, it will be of no use." Mr. Lin's words can be said to be a painful acupuncture for the Chinese people. Now that Japanese pirates are invading, and the national territory is shrinking day by day, and the situation in the Northeast is gradually deteriorating, recalling Mr. Lin's words, I deeply hope that the Chinese people will awaken as soon as possible and treat their numbness, and not wait until their skin and flesh are empty and turn their hearts useless.</p>

<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>▲Xiong Xiling</p>
<p>The world calls Tai Bingsan (Xiong Xiling) a phoenix, some think it's mockery because Xiling was from Fenghuang Hall in Hunan (now a county). Called such based on the place, like Zeng Guofan of Xiangxiang, or Li Hongzhang of Hefei. The Phoenix area is low-lying, small in area, sparsely populated, and full of miasma, unsuitable for long-term residence. The Qing set up a vice magistrate to govern. It is said that few survived. Therefore, in the backyard of the office, coffins were stacked, all officials who died in office. People didn't dare go. Zhu Qiyi of Changshu, a famous scholar, didn't believe the rumors. He asked the governor to give it a try. When he took office, he met Xiling. He saw Xiling as material for a prime minister. He betrothed a younger sister to him, who is now the famous Ms. Qi Hui. Chen Youming (Baozhen) of Yining, who pacified Hunan, recruited many scholars and advocated reforms. Xu Hongfu (Renzhu), the education commissioner, and Huang Gongdu (Zunxian), the provincial judge, were all fond of elegance and advocated reform. They once gathered Liang Qichao, Tang Caichang, and Xiling for a meeting to found schools, formulate regulations, and discuss new policies. During the Reform Movement of 1898, all were convicted. Xiling was already a Jinshi and a Shujishi at the time, and was also dismissed. Later, as a Daoyuan, he stayed in Jiangnan and was valued by Duanfang. He accompanied him to Japan to investigate constitutional government. Zhao Erxun specifically recommended his talent as very useful and spoke to the Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Zai Ze. At that time, Ze was manipulating the government as a nobleman. He sought out Xiling, was amazed by his talent, and requested to fill the position of financial supervisor of Fengtian with a fourth-rank official. Ze also framed and killed his in-law, the governor of Hubei, Rui Cheng, and claimed that Xiling was good at adapting to changes. Cheng submitted a memorial recommending him as the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of Hubei. Xiling declined the official position. He then moved to the salt transport envoy of the three eastern provinces. When the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, Xiling had already crossed the sea to the south. He spent every evening in the company of Japanese celebrities, arguing the beauty of democratic politics. After the Republic was established, he became the first Minister of Finance. He left with the Tang cabinet. Before long, he was suddenly appointed as the military governor of Rehe. He telegraphed that the army would enter. Those who were knowledgeable were shocked. Some said that he coveted the wealth of the Rehe Palace treasures and had been seeking it for a long time. After taking office, he frequently entered the palace in disguise, claiming to be an Yi Zhen and changing his title to a soldier. This was actually playing into the hands of the opposition. The post of Military Governor lacked precedent for civilians to hold. Later, someone sued him to the government. Xiang Cheng secretly ordered the Ministry of Justice to investigate and reply. Rumors are not to be trusted. Previously, when Xiling resigned and entered Beijing, he was summoned to form a cabinet. He met with Xiang Cheng. Xiang Cheng laughed and took his hand and said. "You are here, very good. The country's affairs are entrusted to someone, I have no worries. You can carefully select talents to prepare for the ministries." Xiling replied. "The scope of talent is very broad. You are not lacking in Fang Du Yao Song. I am incapable and can hardly overcome difficulties. If you must use me to mislead the country, you should choose second-rate figures to jointly praise the great cause of the founding of the country." He finished speaking and took out a list to show Xiang Cheng. The leaders of each department intended to be Wang Daxie for foreign affairs, Liu Renxi for internal affairs, Liang Qichao for finance, Shen Jiaben for justice, Chen Huan for the army, Sa Zhenbing for the navy, Fan Yuanlian for education, Zhang Qian for agriculture and commerce, and Yang Du for transportation. Xiang Cheng looked at the list and said. "These are first-class talents. I know them all. Have you obtained the consent of these people?" Xiling said. "Liu and Shen are modest. The rest are willing to help me." Xiang Cheng picked up a pen and made many changes. He handed the paper to Xiling and said. "What do you think?" Xiling agreed and withdrew. When he was appointed, Qichao became the head of justice, Daxie became the head of education, Qian became the head of agriculture and commerce, and the rest were the people who had been changed. By winter, he had been dismissed. Since then, for more than ten years, he has been drifting and supervising names, such as coal oil, river works, or disaster relief. Right and wrong, merits and demerits, are in the world. In the gengwu year, Zai Ze died. There was nothing to pay for the funeral. Moreover, he was involved in litigation due to production. Xiling quickly invited Yang Shicong, Yang Shounan, Ding Naiyang, and others to contribute some funds to stop the matter. He also set aside money for his children's clothing, food, and education expenses, which is far better than those who are friends in the morning and enemies in the evening.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Looking out of the train window, the countryman saw rows of people with red cloths wrapped around their arms and water pipe boxes hanging from their waists. They were standing neatly, blowing tunes of "Resistance, resistance, no resistance," and beating out rhythms of "No movement, no movement, really no movement," as if welcoming someone.</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right!" He thought to himself again, believing his idea was not bad, and couldn't help but shout it out.</p>
<p>"What is it? What do you mean, 'That's right, that's right'?" The gentleman with glasses asked him.</p>
<p>"There must be a bride in our car. They're here to welcome the bride." The countryman was very confident that he had guessed correctly.</p>
<p>"Pah! Welcoming a bride would at most involve a band of Qingyin (a type of Chinese folk music) playing and singing. How could there be such a large contingent of soldiers welcoming her at the train station?" The gentleman with glasses was naturally a veteran.</p>
<p>"So they're all soldiers? I thought they were guests at a wedding."</p>
<p>"Of course they're soldiers. This playing and singing is a military band. I might as well teach you a lesson."</p>
<p>"How could I not know about military bands? But..."</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"But gentry families in the city also use military bands when marrying a daughter-in-law. When my landlord, Old Master Zhang, married his third grandson's wife, didn't they also use a military band? But they wore red clothes, not yellow clothes. I still think I'm right, they're here to welcome the bride." The countryman, like a modern military expert or politician, refused to admit he was wrong and tried to defend his statement.</p>
<p>"What makes you think they're definitely welcoming the bride?" The gentleman with glasses was also unwilling to yield, and insisted on getting to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>"I can hear it from their military music. Resistance requires strength. Tonight, the bride will meet the groom, like a weak country meeting a strong country, with no resistance. Resistance requires preparation. The bride usually doesn't prepare by dancing or playing ball, so tonight she's bound to suffer. That's why their trumpets are blowing 'no resistance.' And movement also needs to be at an appropriate degree. When you can't move, you can't move recklessly. Reckless movement will cause problems. So you need to be calm. Calmness means no movement. Listen to the sound of their brass drums, they're beating out 'no movement, no movement, no movement.' That is to say, instead of moving recklessly, it's better not to move. So I say they might be here to welcome the bride."</p>
<p>No one listened to the countryman's nonsense, because the train had already stopped and people were pushing and shoving to get off.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Financial Last Week's Gold Market Undergoes Significant Change <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Silver Market Frequently Rises, Exchange Rate Loosens Excessively, International News Unfavorable to the Gold Market</p>
<p>▲ The Disastrous Drop of 54 Taels and Change: The Gold Market Bidding Last Week Experienced an Astonishing Transformation; The Plunge Was Terrifying, The Angry Tide and Giant Waves Unstoppable, Daily Difference of Five or Six to Twenty-Odd Taels; People Were Extremely Anxious. From the Beginning of the Week, Between 680 and 690 Taels, Suddenly on Friday, It Broke Through to 630 Taels, Seeing a New Low Price of 26 Taels. The Resulting Slight Turn Was More Moderate, Returning to 640 Taels. This Week Had a Total of 67 Taels of Retrospect, Cumulatively Plummeting 54 Taels and Change, Which Can Be Said to Be Huge. This Was Due to the Overseas Silver Market's Frequent and Fierce Rises Since the Previous Thursday, Actually Exceeding 20 Pence, Marking a New Record for This Year. The Shanghai Exchange Rate Rose Accordingly, Extremely Loose and Excessive, With the Shilling Exceeding 10 Pence, and the Listed Price Lengthening by as Much as Eight Divisions. Those in the Gold Industry Generally Dumped, But the Weekend Saw a Slight Movement Towards Settlement and Offsetting Previous Shorts. Moreover, News from the International Arena Generally Affected the Gold Market, Further Exacerbated by the Increasingly Fierce Momentum of the Violent Japanese, Who Recently Brazenly Invaded the Black Provinces. Thus, Under Environmental Pressure, Although the Daily Volume of Transactions Was Not Huge, the Dalian Group Had Turned Bullish, While the Guangdong Group Still Held a Short Position. As for the Settlement Price, the Maximum Was Pressed Over 90 Taels, and the Minimum Was 50 Taels. This Was Mostly Due to the Spot Market Being Bare and Red Due to the Tight Silver Supply, and the Sluggish Sales Market Reduced Its Ability to Accept Orders. The Future Market Conditions Are Feared to Still Have Turbulence. Here Is a Summary of the General Situation During This Week:</p>
<p>Daily Fluctuations Are Shocking and Terrifying. Monday, November 2, Coincided with the First Day of the Preliminary Competition. Banks and Gold Exchanges, as Usual, Had Half-Day Business in the Morning. The Big Bar Lengthened Again by 3.125, to 3.125; American Silver Lengthened by 1.25; Shilling Did Not Change; However, the American Exchange Rate, Due to Exchange Differences, Contracted by 1.25, While the Internal Market Seemed to Rise.

There Was a 14 Taels Difference Between Morning and Afternoon. Speculator Wu Made a Balanced Move. On Wednesday, the Big Bar, the Sixth Day, Lengthened Again by 6.875. The Silver Price Halted. However, the Shilling Lengthened by Two and a Half Divisions. The Internal Market, on the Contrary, Strengthened. Truly, the Overt and Covert Trends Differed. Those in the Industry Continued to Dump Non-Stop. As for the Gold Bidding Opening, It Rebounded by 4 Taels and a Half, Calculating to 681 Taels. Mostly, the Foothold of the Big Bar Was Seen as Good. American Sellers Were Excited. The Dalian Group Was the First to Sell. Then Foreign Merchant Joseph Came to Sell, Also Because the Shilling Was Loose and Discounted. When It Fell to 77 Taels and 1 Mace, Suddenly a Rumor Spread That Someone Was Organizing a Bullish Company. People's Hearts Were Lifted, Rising to 83 Taels and a Half, But It Was All Empty Air. Soon After, Because Sellers Swarmed Up, It Broke Through Into 80 Taels. The Morning Closed at 78 Taels and a Half, Slightly Rebounding by 2 Taels. There Was a 6 Taels and 2 Mace Rotation in Half a Day. This Was a Sharp Fall With a Small Rebound. On Thursday, the Big Bar Retracted by 3.125. The Silver Price, on the Contrary, Lengthened by 2.5. The British Gold Did Not Change. The American Gold Was Listed Longer by 3.125, Due to the Exchange Rate Rebounding. The Internal Market Transaction Price Was Quite Loose. American Gold Was Especially Firm. Mostly, the Gold Market Initially Opened at 677 Taels and a Half, With a Small Drop of 1 Taels. Then, Because of More Buying, It Rose to 80 Taels and 6 Mace. Afterwards, Because of Rumors That Japan Was Again Prohibiting Gold Exports, and the Violent Japanese Invasion of the Black Provinces Was in a Tense Situation, The Market Was Filled With Clouds of Worry, Plummeting More Than Ten Taels, Breaking Through 70 Taels. At Noon, It Was Only 63 Taels and 5, Closing at 67 Taels and 7 Mace. In the Afternoon, Because the Autumn Competition Had Ended, Therefore the Afternoon Market Opened as Usual, Initially at 70 Taels. Afterwards, Suddenly Hearing That Britain Had Changed to a Silver Standard, Buying Silver Bars, The News Spread, All Firms' Selling Spirit Was Boiling, Wildly Dropping More Than Ten Taels, To 52 Taels and a Half After 4 O'Clock, Until the Market Closed at 55 Taels and 5 Mace, a Huge Drop of 23 Taels Again Compared to the Previous Day. The Fore and Aft Markets Had a Total of 28 Taels and 1 Mace of Retrospect. The Dalian Group Vigorously Sold 3,000. Joseph and Wu Both Tended to Sell Off, Aggressively Shorting. The Next Day, the Big Bar Silver Lengthened Again by 6.875. The Silver Price Lengthened by 1.5 Fen. The Shilling Lengthened by Four Divisions. Both the Overt and Covert Markets Were Loose. As for the Gold Market, the Initial Opening Plummeted by 9 Taels and a Half, To 46 Taels. The Next Was 48 Taels.

Then 47 Taels and 5 Mace. Again, Because the Selling Trend Was Flourishing, And the Exchange Rate Was Especially Loose, Disasterously Dropping More Than 20 Taels, Breaking Through Into 30 Taels, Suddenly to 26 Taels. Then, Because Hengxing Came in, The Market Closed at 29 Taels and 5 Mace, Continuing to Drop 26 Taels. According to the Full Day, There Was a Difference of 22 Taels.

The Shilling Lengthened by 2.5. The American Gold Lengthened by 8.75. Unexpectedly, at Noon, It Suddenly Changed to Retract by 2.5, American Gold by 6.25, While the Internal Market Tended to Strengthen. Those in the Industry Had Some Shorts to Cover. Mostly, the Gold Market Opened, on the Contrary, Rising 4 Taels and 5, To 34 Taels. Namely, the Foothold Was Good. America Dumped, And Also Because of the Rumor That Japan Had Loosened the Ban on Miscellaneous Protection of Gold, People's Hearts Were Upward. The Next Was 33 Taels. Afterwards, Slightly Higher, 38 Taels and 8 Mace. Again, Because the Exchange Market Was Loose and Discounted, And Sellers Swarmed Up, It Had Already Broken Through 30 Taels, To 28 Taels and a Half.

<h3 id="e150">Big Bar Turns to Contract, Gold and Silver Continue to Rise <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>▲ Gold Bidding Is Expected to Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Telegram Arrived From London. The Big Bar Silver All Turned to Contract Again, Such as the Near Term Falling Back by 3.125, To 20 Pence. The Far Term Also Contracted by 3.125, Calculating to 19 Pence 875. The Foothold Fell Because China Had a Slight Sell-Off. Speculators Bought in at Low Prices. The Market Situation Turned Firm After Closing. Also, Because the American Silver Price Still Saw an Increase, Therefore Today's Gold Bidding May See a Falling Trend.

A Private Telegram Also Lengthened by 1.25. The Market Situation Was Very Firm. English to American Shortened by 1.25, To 3 Yuan 7 Jiao 9 Fen 875.

<p>Yesterday Was Sunday. Banks Were Closed as Usual. Therefore, the Forms and Market Conditions of All Parties Were Very Quiet. However, Because the Silver Supply Was Lacking in Cushioning, There Was No Way to Maneuver. Thus, It Tightened Again, Consequently Causing the Silver Discount to Suddenly Rise by 1 Mace.

<p>▲ The Environmental Circumstances Were Good in the First Half of the Week, And the Increase Was Quite Strong ▲ People's Hearts Were Uneasy on Thursday and Friday, And Prices Fell Back Again</p>
<p>Last Week (From November 2 to November 7) The Market Conditions of Various Bonds on the Local Chinese Merchant Exchange. Spot Prices Coming In and Out Were Still Not Lonely. Besides Customs 96, All Other Bonds Had Openings. A Total of 153,500 Yuan, Of Which Disbandment Was 57,500 Yuan, 19th Good Was 24,000 Yuan, Military Reduction and Finance Were Each 14,000 Yuan, 19th Customs Unified Tax Was Approximately 10,000, Others Were Only 5-6,000 Yuan. The Futures Market Was Flat as Before, Because Large Accounts Still Held a Wait-and-See Attitude. The Bond Market Was Chaotic as Before. The Market Was Still Dominated by Sporadic Entries and Exits. Examining the Entire Week, Besides the Opening of Over 1.5 Million on Tuesday, The Remaining Months Only Had Over 10 Million. Statistics for the Total Transaction Number for the Entire Week Was 67.21 Million Yuan, Of Which Unified Tax Was Still More Prosperous, Calculating to November Term Being 10.68 Million, December Term Being 3.765 Million Yuan, 20th Customs November Term Being 8.595 Million Yuan, December Term Being 1.885 Million Yuan, Salt Tax November Term Being 6.085 Million Yuan, December Term Being 3.335 Million Yuan, 19th Customs Military Reduction Was Next, 19th Customs Divided November Term Being 7.095 Million Yuan, December Term Being 1.11 Million, Military Reduction November Term Being 4.195 Million Yuan, December Term Being 3.59 Million Yuan. 20th Volume November Term Being 4.715 Million Yuan, December Term Being 1.78 Million Yuan, 19th Good November Term Being 3.095 Million Yuan, December Term Being 1.015 Million Yuan, Disbandment and Dismissal Others Only Had November Term Openings, Calculating to 96 Public Debt Being 1.2005 Million Yuan, Reorganization 6 Li Being 860,000 Yuan, Customs Duty Being 745,000 Yuan, Finance Being 70,000 Yuan. As for the Changing Situation, Besides the Beginning of the Week, Its Ups and Downs Were Still Considered Peaceful. Mostly, During the Past Week, The Circumstances and Situation Were Chaotic, Absolutely Lacking Progress. The National Peace and Unification Conference Frequently Fell Into a State of Stagnation, With No New Developments. Although the Diplomatic Situation Seemed More Favorable to Us, But the Japanese Still Disregarded International Public Opinion, Continuing to Invade Wantonly. The Situation Still Had a Dangerous Possibility of Expanding. Therefore, the People's Hearts on the Market Held a Wait-and-See Attitude, With No Place to Settle. Large Accounts Still Did Not Have Huge Inflows and Outflows. Bond Market Prices, Therefore, Also Had Difficulty Having a Consistent Trend. However, On the First Day of the Week, Because at That Time It Was Suddenly Reported That Peace and Unification Was More Hopeful, The Northeast Situation Had a Turning Point Through the Mediation of Britain and the United States. For a Time, People's Hearts Were Greatly Comforted, And the Local Financial Situation in This Port Also Improved. The Silver Supply Was Loose, Market Investments and Receipts Suddenly Became Extremely Active, Resulting in the Degree of Increase Reaching the Limit and Leading to Suspensions of Auctions, Actually Reaching Twelve Types, Which Is Rarely Seen Recently. Although the Trend on Tuesday Had Already Greatly Seen Peace, But It Still Consistently Continued to Rise Quite Vigorously. Wednesday Slightly Turned Weak. The Ups and Downs Were Still Small. Thursday's Market Situation Again Presented Weakness. Generally, In Light of No New Developments in the Domestic and International Situation, The Japanese Further Increased Their Reckless Cruelty, Sending Troops to the Black Provinces, Triggering the Potential of a Soviet-Russian War. Therefore, Sell-Offs Turned More Prosperous Than Buys. Bond Prices Fell One After Another, Calculating to Each Falling Back by 1.5 to 3 Yuan. Friday Still Showed Exhaustion. Changes Were Still Slight. The Market Was Slightly Better on the Weekend. The Market's Report Quoted That the United States Had Made Recommendations to Japan. Congress Was Resuming Soon. Therefore, the Buyer's Popularity Was Slightly More Prosperous. Several Types of Bond Prices Were Raised by About 1.5 Yuan. Looking at the Changes in Each Bond Throughout the Week, The Development of the External Situation Was Still the Important Reason. The Future Trend Is Still Difficult to Predict. It Will Not Deviate From This Path. However, It Is Generally Believed That the Current Bond Market Has Been Somewhat More Optimistic Than Before. As a Result, the Total Variation in Each Price for the Entire Week Was Approximately Four or Five Yuan, Generally Rebounding by About Two or Three Yuan Compared to the Previous Week. However, Customs Duty, Disbandment, 19th Customs, Etc., Only Slightly Improved by a Few Jiao. Now, A Statistics Table of the High and Low Increases and Decreases of Each Public Bond Price Over the Past Week Is Listed Separately, (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e153">Yarn and Cotton Last Week's Marked Yarn Declines <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>▲Spot Sales are Very Quiet</p>
<p>For a week, the yarn market has been very weak. With national affairs becoming increasingly precarious and silver becoming tighter, commerce cannot develop, the market is becoming increasingly depressed, and gold prices have plummeted and silver prices have soared. The more anxious people are, the more manufacturers have been setting up in the middle of the road, and the market has become more and more unspeakable. Therefore, the bid yarn fell below the 60-tael mark, and the prices for each month fell by 2.6-7 yuan from the previous week. The spot yarn business is extremely sluggish. Because the finances are not loose and the disaster in all directions is severe, the purchasing power should be reduced. Fortunately, there is less stock of this yarn, and the factories have emptied their existing goods and have no hoarding at all. Therefore, the spot yarn market price is still able to maintain and has not seen a big drop. The weekend is gradually trending down, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Last Week's Hankou Standard Cotton Turned Soft From Firm <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ 60,000 Bales of American and Indian Cotton Were Sold</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the cotton market was very strong, and the bulls were very keen on squeezing the market due to the lack of goods coming from all directions. The stronger the pull, the more the standard cotton in each month was seen at 33 taels and 5 mace. This month, the price once reached 3 taels and 7 mace 5. However, American cotton was extremely weak. Later, due to the skyrocketing silver price, the sharp drop in gold price, and the excessive loosening of exchange rates, the silver price for imported cotton was very low. Factories absorbed large quantities, so the buyers showed an uneasy state, and the market suddenly showed loopholes. However, some bulls and cotton merchants are still holding on tightly and refusing to let go in recent months. In general, it is still dangerous. Local cotton transactions have been completely taken over by foreign cotton, and hopes for future eradication. According to the survey, the Shanghai plant of the Research Institute purchased about 600,000 bales of Indian and American cotton. Inland Hankou and other gangs imported about 200,000 bales. Tianjin is not yet included, but the number has already reached 800,000 bales. In this situation, the position of native cotton is extremely unstable. The price of standard cotton for each month fell by about 1 tael compared to the previous week. The price of American cotton was similar to last week. 60,000 pieces of American, Chinese, and Indian cotton were traded last week, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e155">American Cotton Sold Short in the South <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed while waiting for the government report. It was firm at first due to purchases by manufacturers, but then weak due to short selling in the South. Futures fell 4 to 6 points, spot fell 5 points. British cotton futures rose 3 to 4 points, spot fell 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell 5 points. Indian cotton was weak due to sales by Japanese merchants, with Pingle falling 0.75 rupees, Omra falling 3 rupees, and Balaram falling 2.75 rupees.

<p>▲ Yesterday, the amount of goods arriving from each gang in Nantou was slightly less. Morning sales in urban and rural stores were calm. At first, the stomach of the trade was congested, but later, due to insufficient supply, transactions slightly recovered. Bai Geng from Sutong, Changzhou, and Xixi rose slightly. Few goods arrived of Baige and late rice, and the appetite in Ningbo was limited. Transactions on this street were extremely good, rising by a corner and a half. Very few Lyuyang Tip Grade were available, and prices fell by a corner. Old and broken Yinyuan arrived and sold evenly, and prices remained as before.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, 26 or 27 ships arrived at Xinzha. Transactions on this street were not smooth, and combined with the long sunny weather, customers were raising prices, while rice mills still had a small number of accumulations. Rural sales were very strong, and Xixin Geng was raised in stages. Baige Six Varieties were slightly raised on the stack by two chi. Not much white rice was shipped, and there was no change. Broken rice and Yinyuan had sluggish transactions and opened lower by five fen. There was no honor or disgrace for Puyang Tip, and the downstream image was presented. The trade in Kunshan rice was the healthiest, jumping sharply by three or four corners. The amount opened in Hexia was from five thousand two hundred to three hundred shi.</p>
