<h3>天津亂事純由日人指使</h3>
<p>施肇基向國聯報告</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　中國施總代表今日將天津最近紛擾情形報告理事會、謂天津此次之流血與紛擾、爲日本利用中國不逞之徒、醖釀叛亂政策之又一步驟、當本月七八兩日、天津當道已接報告、日人决定在十一月十六日理事會重開以前、利用中國人間反對國民政府份子、擾亂北平天津兩埠治安、天津日人曾發給此輩華人小軍器五百件、八日夜間遂有二千人持日旗由日租界衝出、欲圖攻佔省政府與公安局、日租界内并向華界開放三十砲、但卒爲警察所却退、現日人誣稱此事係吉林二十九旅兵士與天津警察間之衝突、不知天津并無吉林軍隊、且吉林軍中亦無第二十九旅、其說不攻自破、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　中代表發表一文、言天津亂事、謂日當道煽惑敗類造反、有衆二千人手執日旗、從日租界衝入中國境、攻擊警署、嗣後當中國警察尊重日當道之請、從日租界邊界退出三百米達、天津城被砲擊三十餘次云、（十日路透社電）</p>
<h3>關於軍備停造案施肇基之聲明</h3>
<p>須取决於滿案前途</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日中代表施博士函致國聯、答覆軍備停造一年之提議、聲明中國可依議、但謂軍備停造及軍縮大會等問題、必須取决於滿洲問題之美滿解决、倘和平撑持物如國聯會章與非戰公約等不幸傾覆、則中國無可如何、惟有視其他國事爲緩圖、而儘先建築國防要具、使之充分堅强、足以保持我土地完整與政治獨立、以拒外來侵略而已云、（十日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國難中之孫中山先生誕辰與四全大會</h3>
<p>今日爲孫中山先生之誕辰紀念。而在京國民黨之第四次全國代表大會。亦於今日正式開幕。於偉大光輝之紀念日。舉行極其重要之會議。實愈顯其意議之重大。同時當前正國難重重。民溺洪流國迫强敵。風雨飄搖。危機環生。則四全大會在今日開幕。亦愈顯其責任之鉅艱。</p>
<p>在今日吾人所引爲缺憾者。即孫中山先生手創之中國國民黨。比年以來。未能堅固團結。步趨一致。迄至今日。京粤兩方。仍各舉行其四全大會。此誠爲一不幸之現象。但果使雙方各開會議。而眞能以合作行之。閉會以後。雙方以至誠共謀永久之團結。則暫時之陰影。固無傷於皎日之光明。此不僅爲國民黨前途之大幸。抑亦我國家前途深所利賴。</p>
<p>吾人身當國難。憂心如擣。默察時勢。謹以數事買陳大會。</p>
<p>一中山先生致力革命凡四十年。累積其經騐與學識。手定三民主義建國方略。理論之精深。與見解之遠大。誠爲救中國之鎖鑰。中山先生逝世。則發揚光大三民主義實現建國方略之責。端在於服膺於中山先生之信徒。即在於中山先生唯一之遺産中國國民黨。世界各國革命領袖。生前之思想與主張。類多在其殁後以其門人信徒之研究。闡明而發揚光大。但自中山先生逝世。國民黨統一全國而後。中山主義之信徒。都孜孜於從政。而對於整理并闡明中山主義之工作。則極少有人措意。而狡焉者流。於革命之中山主義。甚且予以故意之曲解或誤解。歷年領袖之分裂。與黨内之糾紛。主義之不彰。實其大因。故今後服膺於中山主義之信徒。與奉行三民主義之中國國民黨之黨員。至少應有一部分人。移其從政之熱忱。致力於三民主義之研究。以闡明主義。統一理論。并以完成中山先生未竟之遺志。</p>
<p>二。革命黨人。但有犧牲。絕無安享之幸福。有之則在於革命成功之日。在於全體人民獲得幸福之後。世界歷遊蘇聯之人士。類都極口稱贊布爾塞維克黨員之刻苦。在黨員私人。幾無絲毫權利可言。而此種精神。則有至足多者。今三民主義之革命仍未成功。人民苦痛仍未能解除。而國民黨黨員所享之權利與安逸。則容有超越於人民之處。執政之黨。責至艱鉅。「革民尙未成功。黨員仍須努力。」安享權利。尙非其時。能先人民之憂而憂。後人民之樂。而樂乃眞無愧於革命黨人。故此次四全大會。應注意糾正黨員苟安之心理。而鼓舞其奮鬥之精神。以促進國民革命。早底於成功。</p>
<p>三。一黨之主義與政策。欲博得廣大羣衆之同情與擁護。不在於空口之宣傳。而在於事實之昭示。蓋人民之所要求者。爲眞實具體之事實。而不在於空頭之支票。國民黨於此屆四全大會之先。曾已舉行三屆代表大會。一二兩屆且置勿論。即第三屆大會之决議。亦累成巨帙。關於内政外交。都已確定方案。然而今日試一檢閱。是否都已實行。集全黨之精英。不患無决議。但患决議之不能實行。坐而言尤貴起而行。執政後之國民黨。尤應注意於斯。故本屆大會應嚴厲檢閱過去之成績。尤應注重動員全體黨員。努力於本屆决議之實現。</p>
<p>四。目前國家已臨到空前之艱難。水災之救濟。元氣之恢復。東北失地之收回。横暴强鄰之抗禦。皆亟有待於我政府領導國人共同之努力。尤有進者。早前世界人士推測第二次世界大戰之爆發。或認爲在於遠東。或認爲仍在於西歐。見解殊不一致。自九月十八東北禍變爆發而後。世論已一致認定遠東問題爲第二次戰禍之火藥爲無可避免。我國爲遠東問題之中心。假如將來大戰。不幸而一旦爆發。我國無以應戰。則國家前途。將至不堪設想。故本屆大會之使命。其尤重要者。爲如何打破當前之國難。如何對付來日之國際局面。對内對外都應有周密之計劃。庶能定我邦國於風雨飄搖。</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>▲翁綬祺襄贊戎機之機變</p>
<p>吳江翁綬祺。號印石。少年科第。書畫兼精。甲午之役。投筆從戎。隸吳大澂暮府。任執法官。兼機要秘書。兵駐錦州。其時副吳者爲四川提督宋慶。宋向隸馮子材官保部下。中法諒山之役。戰功卓著。中外咸欽。吳率領五十餘營。宋祇帶二十營副之。日人知宋之善戰。頗憚之。常用暗探化裝入吳營窺察軍情。一夕新月微明。翁因公率從弁十餘騎。銜枚疾馳。過某寺。瞥見田禾微動。細矚之。羣犬奔逐。厥狀尤異。囑從弁發槍擊之。犬人立而奔。翁飭弁圍捕之。獲日人四。均披黑衣面罩。而裝作羣犬者也。帶回大營。嚴訊得其秘。盡置諸法。蓋日探均奉有重大之責任。欲埋地雷於田中。以創我軍。倘不遇翁。則五十營之兵士。早成灰燼矣。時人均佩服翁之機變。而能滅此日探也。</p>

<h3>莫輕看徒弟</h3>
<p>一百六十二年前發明蒸汽機關之瓦特James　Watte。曾經做過徒弟。一百年前發明發電機之法拉第Michael　Faraday。曾經做過徒弟。産業革命和電化文明是徒弟們在知識之最前線領導着。</p>
<p>中國的希望，向來是放在學生身上。最初大家的目光都對着留學生。到了留學生失了信仰，大家又轉移目光對着大學生。到了大學生失了信仰，大家又轉移目光對着中學生，現在是漸漸的轉移到小學生了。如果先生和學生們没有根本覺悟，則中學生，小學生是同樣的要令人失望。</p>
<p>文明是人類用頭腦和雙手造成的。只會勞心而不會勞力和只會勞力而不會勞心的人都是没有希望，何况愛用空嘴說白話，那是更無救藥了。如果肯得用手去做用腦去想，那末，留學生大學生也有希望。否則兩雙手兒攏在袖裏讀死書，死讀書，讀書死，那末，連中學生，小學生也有一天要呌人失望咧。我對於科學的青年的建議是：</p>
<p>一，做過學生的要做幾年徒弟；</p>
<p>二，做過徒弟的要做幾年學生。</p>
<h3>記愛國男兒繡花針事</h3>
<p>— 陸士方</p>
<p>前見報載倭人在我東省。招致鬍匪首領綽號小白龍者。授以步槍四千枝。子彈十萬發。使擾亂地方治安。以爲久佔遼吉之口實。小白龍佯示願受指揮。俟得槍彈後。即率其部下。逕向倭人襲擊。倭人大爲受創云云。此項紀載。是否確係實録。抑秉筆者故作快心之談。聊當屠門大嚼。雖不得而知。然緑林中人。多血性男兒。尙有國家觀念與民族思想。非比食肉者流。祇知個人利禄。而不惜作賣國行爲。此吾人可以深信不疑者。至倭人狡計百出。思利用鬍匪。以破壞東北治安。尤爲意中之事。則其事要自可信。彼熙治張海鵬輩對之。當慚愧欲死矣。余按此與明季海盜繡花針之計敗清軍。差堪頡頏。爰追述繡花針事。以愧夫一般甘心步武張邦昌李完用者。</p>
<p>繡花針者非他。乃愛國英雄鄭芝龍之舊部王興也。出身海盜軀幹短小。饒有智略。時人呼爲繡花針。明亡後。聚衆千餘。守粤之文村圍。會有明宗室某避難依圍中。興奉之爲主。招集四方豪傑。搢紳之不願薙髮者。咸爭就之。清師旣下粤東。檄文村圍使來歸附。興以書答之曰。「頑民無所爲。將欲存中國於一隅。全禮義於百世。豈徒惜此數莖頂上毛而已。至於海涯片地。原我故物。本朝常置之度外。何論新朝哉。如必欲致之。則頑民死不來也。」清兵以銳師攻之興自知不敵非可以力守。詭爲行成。奉表乞降。清兵旣至。興出其不意。突襲擊之。殺敵無算。後清兵悉數來攻。文村圍食盡。興聲嘶力竭。計無所施。乃仰藥自殺。臨終。猶謂其部屬曰。「凡吾所爲。所以愧中國臣民之失身事虜者也。」嗚呼烈矣。可不謂之愛國男兒哉。</p>
<h3>遼陽縣長媚日之一封書</h3>
<p>— 湘竹女士自營口寄</p>
<p>此次暴日侵佔我遼吉。凡有血氣之倫。莫不髮指。如此次日政府派侍從武官川岸少將赴遼吉一帶宣慰慘殺我同胞之日軍。行至遼陽縣時。該縣縣長楊顯青氏。奴膝婢顔。竭力奉承。然處於暴日淫威之下。尙有可恕。觀其所致川岸一函。歌功頌德。始知其心已死。其血已寒矣。兹録其函如下。</p>
<p>敬陳者。遼陽地方承貴國官兵及貴軍部充量協助。賴享安全幸福。皆由皇恩遠播。薄海同欽。凡我官民人等。均致竭誠感謝。替表以聞。敬乞大日本帝國欽差大臣轉奏天皇陛下聖鑒。並祝萬歲萬萬歲。遼陳縣長楊顯青率官民全體拜上。</p>
<h3>蘇俄之電影計畫</h3>
<p>— 乙未生</p>
<p>蘇俄最近有一敎育的口號。曰「凡學校敎員均須能放演電影。」</p>
<p>最近莫斯科新聞記者往訪蘇俄最大的電影托拉斯主任森姆雅斯基。記其談話如下。</p>
<p>「一九三二年之末。吾等將需要電影司機者七萬五千人。此七萬五千電影司機人。將於何處得之乎。在今年内。吾人已於所辦之術科學校中訓練得一萬二千員。明年更可訓練得三萬五千。然此數尤未敷需要之數目。故今年秋季已令所有師範班級中均增設電影放演一科。吾等計畫訓練鄕村敎師（女子）三萬人。使以放演電影爲其副業。今兹之鄕村敎員。固已工作太忙。益以個人之社交活動所佔之時間。又何暇及此。吾等將更益以此種新工作而增加其勞動的負擔乎。曰。否本機關將許可其僱傭三名至四名農家女子以爲助手。彼可訓練其助手襄理課務或放演電影之事。此則因本機關所取去其學校課務之時間多寡而酌量處理之。一方面復可爲此等農家女子預備冬月之新工作也。」</p>
<p>關於有聲電影問題。森姆雅斯基曰。</p>
<p>「吾人於此。誠屬異常落伍。在今日全個蘇維埃中。有聲電影戲院僅得三所。至今年年末。將增至一百所翌年增至五百五十所。此種速度之增加。引起許多技術上之問題。現今所有之機件。爲值至昻。抑亦不完美。故須於極迅速中。完成較廉價之計畫。是即以發聲附件。附加於尋常放演機。則價廉而易舉矣。吾等於有聲電影。固屬落伍。而同時對於此術。亦頗有確爲重要之發明。例如在甲地攝製一片。同時可於距離極遠之乙地作收音機關。其次爲旅行放演用窄長而不焚燒之片。更次則爲顔色片。明年當可完成顔色片二十部也。」</p>
<h3>今日詩選</h3>
<p>— 林儷琴</p>
<p>頃承陳丈潔泉。惠贈崇明曹鈍吟先生鈍廬詩文集全部。開卷有益。得資觀摩。至可感也。曹先生爲崇明碩儒。道德文章。夙爲鄕黨所欽仰。尤擅書法。深得蘇髯神髓。爲文多經世濟民之作。詩賦尤多憂時之詞。今摘其集中詩數章。爲今日詩選。</p>
<p>皇姑屯大盜移鼎九州裂。羣雄競喋中原血。公孫躍馬起遼東。意態堂皇何雄傑。榆關百戰載櫜弓。河北諸軍趨下風。雄都九門建高纛。策馬長安氣如虹。南苑屯騎盡西走。河洛驕帥旋携手。華元忽登子反床。爭刑白馬推盟首。韶陽鼙鼓渡江來。豫南晉北紛喧豗。前師十萬望風潰。津門不守薊門開。將軍傳令列營拔。瀋陽馳道飇車發。哀哉彭亡地出雷。硝燄漫空飛肉骨。昔有張良博浪椎。韓讐未復秦幾危。於今死刺不用擊。誰與仇者頗猜疑。吁嗟乎豺狼滿地猇虎搏。肘腋危機相倚伏。爭城爭地殺人多。幾見梟雄逃天戮。君不聞岑彭來歙皆賊死。死爲國光亦雄鬼。朱三稱帝弗令終。自有春秋南董史。　　粤警之二三關楚北首方城。河上逍遙久偃旌。霸業已推遼右主。援師未出晉陽兵。殽函後顧封泥薄。江漢何時洗甲清。卿子冠軍成算在。南蠻猶詡刻期平。</p>
<p>嶻嶻毉閭萬丈標。英雄躍馬氣難銷。遼東豕大天驕放。塞外駒肥秋泬寥。玉帳材官鳴鐡騎。緑林豪客珥金貂。軍容南北今誰盛。慚愧羊頭爵滿朝。</p>
<p>▲哀江南之一由來朋黨亂蓬麻。季漢衰唐有覆車。偶語酷於秦尉律。大言翻却魯儒家。河山儼峙東西帝。城野徒訌内外蛇。留得江南生一綫。請抛戈甲惜蟲沙。</p>
<p>右詩數章。所詠雖多誌當時感慨。但其地其事則與今日之倭寇東北。及國内和平問題。似多關連。故以今日詩選爲揭櫫</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人想起了一個笑話；從前也是我們一個村裏人，初次來到上海，人家就騙他道；「黄包車也分三等；坐在踏脚的上面是三等，坐在中間是二等，坐在車篷上面是頭等。」我們這位村裏朋友是一個老實而省錢的人，他便信以爲眞了。到了上海，他眞不肯坐在車子的中間，却去坐在脚踏上面，爲的是要省幾個錢，被路人看見了大笑起來。</p>
<p>原來黄包車是只有中間可坐，車篷和脚踏上，都不可以坐人的，那末黄包車只有二等，並没有頭等，三等。恰恰和電車相反，電車是只有頭等三等，却没有二等咧。他正想到那裏時，不覺失聲道，「咦！奇怪奇怪！」</p>
<p>原來坐在他的左首，有一位朋友，手裏正展開了一張漢口水災圖，那水災圖，都是幾位辦賑的大善士，實地去照的照相，一個繁華熱閙的漢口市，變成一片汪洋，恰恰鄕下人目光所到的，是水災圖中的一幅，表示水略淺的地方，有幾輛黄包車，在水裏拖拽，水已没過了車輪，人是不能坐在中間，便坐到了車篷上去了。鄕下人想：剛纔說起黄包車没有頭等，這不是明明坐了頭等嗎？</p>
<p>「到底到那裏去的？弗要假痴假呆，要買栗子了。」賣栗人把别個客人的票子都賣齊了，站到鄕下人前面來，催他買票。</p>
<p>「我到梅蘭坊，要多少錢？」</p>
<p>「問你買票呀！什麽梅蘭芳？」</p>
<p>「咳！梅蘭坊你也不認得嗎？連我鄕下人也知道了，你們常在上海的的人，反而不曉得。」</p>
<p>「什麽梅蘭芳不梅蘭芳？我是問你買票到什麽地方呢？」這時賣票的也莫名其妙，到底這個鄕下老兒是什麽路數。</p>
<p>「你是不是要去看梅蘭芳今夜的戲嗎？」傍邊一位乘客，見他和賣票人纒不清楚，也想代他解釋一下。</p>
<p>「我不看梅蘭芳的戲，我要到梅蘭坊的地方去。我買票子，只要買到近梅蘭坊的地方，該要多少錢，就是多少錢。」</p>
<p>賣票人弄了半天，還是不明白。</p>
<p>「你說近梅蘭芳的地方！我又不知道梅蘭芳這回到上海來，住在什麽地方？剛上車，就要坐二等車。此刻又要坐到梅蘭芳那裏，你這位先生，眞是一個阿木林，……」</p>
<p>「不差！不差！就是阿木林！我正要找阿木林！」鄕下人便搶着這樣說。</p>

<h3>厘市漸趨萎靡</h3>
<p>▲市塲概况　近因各埠聞滬地銀根加緊、日久未能回鬆、故對於應有欠欵、陸續運現來滬、然内地之欵、大都洋鈔爲主體、是以目前紛紛裝洋來滬、以資抵充、雖屬零星小數、然積流成渠而彚集成數、確亦匪細、未免有關市面之萎靡耳</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格「洋厘」早市爲七錢二分五厘二毫半、午市竟進五分關内爲七錢二分四厘八毫七忽半、結果較前日早市遽跌一厘八毫七忽半、「銀拆」早午市同爲三錢三分、較前日早市徵小二分、劃頭加水轉昻則有二錢八九分、銀行掛牌一錢三分、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情江南小洋、早市及午市同爲六錢五分一厘半、交易早市二千五百角、午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢五分、午市爲六錢四分九厘七毫半、交易早市十一萬五千角、午市八萬五千角、銅元加長一千文、爲三百七十九千五百文、</p>

<h3>證券債券復走疲途</h3>
<p>▲統核跌下一元左右▲趨勢平和市態清閒</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所各債券市况、現貨僅統稅一九善等數種開出、進出續稀少、期市亦仍頗清閒、至言各債趨勢、大致仍屬平和、惟以時局形勢沉悶、對日外交情况、則益覺嚴重、即國際間局勢、亦比前爲緊張、市上以環象如斯、投資買進、益見稀少、大户態度、愈形觀望、雖賣方亦無鉅額售出、而終較買進爲旺、故各債券市價遂一致較前趨疲、在上午兩盤、各債價咸下跌、而勢極呆滯、上落甚微、較前日亦祗跌三四角左右、後市一盤以賣出較多、跌勢亦較勁比上午復小下七八角、結果較前日如一九善二○關捲統稅鹽稅等、均降逾一元、一九關亦小八角餘、而編遣裁兵整六關稅等、則始終無大變化、較前日跌四角左右、又統稅現貨比上週跌三元、一九善現貨獨漲二元、察債市之趨勢、現猶沉悶如前、其前途之運命、將仍視外交情勢之發展以爲轉移也、計全日現貨交易共四十元期貨上午三百四十餘萬、後市一盤則有三百七十餘萬、合計七百十五萬五千元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市跌風重起</h3>
<p>紗市甚疲、跌風又熾、以國事多難、謠說極盛、而銀根奇緊、致人心鬆動、且有廠商套買、市盤愈弱、投機家傾向抛出、故形勢愈萎、市上實銷受金融影響、而時局糾紛、需要尤缺云、</p>

<h3>棉市疲怠不振</h3>
<p>棉市甚萎、美棉又轉跌風、各廠鑒於大勢不佳、束手觀望、故外棉交易較缺、不過價格仍廉、聞永安廠已購足美棉、可供二三年之需、所以照此情形、本棉地位異常危險、但本埠棉商以各路來貨稍少、在近月拉緊不放、且有軋空心思、故市情得平矣、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市南懈北硬</h3>
<p>▲南頭昨各帮來源不多、城鄕店銷受時局關係、厚新粳行情暫告落定、百哥窰中本街略稍揀取、寗胃略疲、洋杜尖到銷二淡、市無榮辱、陳破貨缺、硬起一角、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日來源零星、河積略有、本城店交因天雨、交易寥寥、開出行情、祗和豐·恒興·慶盛義·同興四家、斛脚約一千石左右、西新六種提起角許、洋杜尖高緊次疲、糯米明定暗緊、</p>
<h3>洋米現漲期平</h3>
<p>昨日洋米現貨仍有本街問訊、客帮亦有辦意、而貨主心思甚堅、市面乃有繼續步好之實現、昨日售開中關小絞十元零三角二分、比前市大近角、期貨自金價平落後、産價划小、洋行中均願抛售、行情乃見逐步下跌、昨日新交易又成十二月份一號西貢一千噸、價五兩三錢七分至五兩三錢半、又四月份回蘢貨一百噸、價五兩七錢、均本街收進、</p>
<h3>粉市跌度尙微</h3>
<p>昨日粉市因洋麥報價、驟跌八九角至一元左右、傳聞洋麥跌價、係因政府之不維持、幸金價轉穏、大部分人心、尙未搖動、以廠家方面、祇小廠略有出檔、大廠不動、實銷方面、亦以天津形勢轉和、近期略有吸進、故全部之環境雖不甚佳、跌度則尙不猛也、結果本月份較前日小五厘、十二月份小二厘半、一月份小一分、二三月份小一分二厘半、四月份小一分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥重趨下游</h3>
<p>▲洋麥暴落……人心消極</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、又趨疲落之象、以洋麥之報價、忽見暴落一元左右、似在金市狂跌中、爲一極堪注意之事、因此人心、均感消極、一般買户、又感束手、以目下之漲落、全憑國外之報價、及匯率之長縮、究竟如需要如何、反少考量也、結果本月份較小二分、十二月份小二分、一二三月份各跌五分、四月份跌四分云、</p>
<h3>糖市劃盤糖跌後略定</h3>
<p>▲遠期粗砂白成交頗盛</p>
<p>昨糖市産區電訊古巴現糖價仍一·三七五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·三二、明年度三月份價一·二九、比較前電均無升降、五月份一·三四、比升二分、九月份一·四三、則反跌一分、爪哇現期糖仍乏升沉、公會市塲劃盤交易岑寂、更以翌日爲先總理誕辰、各界均皆休息、未克出貨、以致進出愈靜、荷糖二十四號粗砂白喊價十兩○二錢半、二十號中砂白十兩買氣沉寂非常、但市氣以荷匯轉縮、人心略轉穏定、太古精Ｂ嘜十一兩七錢半、ＨＸ嘜十一兩四錢半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩一錢、交易亦屬零落、市象較爲堅穏、抛貨荷糖明年二三月份粗砂白交易頗盛、昨市各洋行均有售開、價五元七角至六角半、而華新續開三百噸、價跌五元六角、且行方進意亦懈、市氣殊屬平而乏神云、</p>
<h3>絲茶廠經歐電仍無轉滬</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益趨沈靜、查海外白廠經電報、因外匯步長、仍不見轉、歐美囤户、類均不敢冒險囤積、市氣呆滯、昨祗開利進黄廠經五包、三星進黄絲六包、中和進白乾經十包、價均平疲云、</p>
<h3>無錫秋繭運滬百餘擔</h3>
<p>無錫絲廠業、近因廠絲歐銷一蹶不振、價小虧本、無力支持、紛紛宣告停業、全市絲廠開工者不及十之四、乾繭消費大减、幾至無人問訊、一般餘繭客、咸將存繭運滬求售、昨日錫秋繭又有一百零六担運滬、現存路局貨棧云、</p>
<h3>平水緑茶歐銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、湖州·平水緑茶、英銷略形活動、其中珠茶一項、同孚洋行獨家購進千餘箱、售盤八九十兩、亦較前相差無幾、針眉·秀眉等花色、英莊錦隆、福時等行均有需要、但存底缺乏、交易稀少、惟上中莊之珍眉貢熙緑茶、市面依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>五金黑鐡皮重起漲風</h3>
<p>黑鐡皮自天津帮暴收之後、底存薄弱、因此市價節節上升、每担價竟能開至十一兩七錢半、近數日來、青島牛莊諸帮亦踵起收辦、因此市風重好、交易又呈熱閙、行情喝價估十二兩、聞前昨兩日、又開至五六百扎、但底貨因此益少、而人心良佳、後市標準又有續好之希望云、</p>
<h3>青鉛又到二百噸</h3>
<p>青鉛交易、因出口帮不辦、市甚岑寂、行情因出路不廣、頗有暗步鬆動不象、刻價估十四兩五錢、比前跌二錢半、惟查昨日公和祥棧又到二百噸、恐行情一節、又要再跌云、</p>
<h3>雜訊</h3>
<p>美麥又以裝到七千五百噸、</p>

<p>（在嚴重抗日聲中應禁國貨漲價）</p>
<p>（答）在這全國一致抵制日貨當兒、國貨製造家或商人、利用時機、臨時抬高國貨價格、確是可恨、果有其事、恐自問良心、也有些過不去的、不過其中也要加以分别、因爲國貨製造家、亦有一肚子說不出的苦、中國製造的經騐、不及外國之多、管理不及外國之科學化、産量及銷路、不及外國之廣、政府對於工業家的助力、又不如外國之有力、所以欲求國貨定價、比外國貨低廉、在這幼稚時期、確是極難之事、這層、吾們站在社會方面、也要原諒他們的、但如國貨原來定價、並没有這般高、忽而臨時加起價來、那末、那就千萬不應該的、果眞愛國的工商家、决不宜如此、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>介紹「致青年」</h3>
<p>— 騏人</p>
<p>最近要我得一些從直接的關係上指導青年的一些讀物、的確艱難、給青年讀的東西、並不是没有、近幾年來、自新文學的狂浪捲起了後、少說、雜誌、出版的數量很可驚人、但求的質量、祗是旁引舉例的去指導青年、很少從自己的經歷上摘了下來去貢獻給青年的、因此、青年所得到的、至多亦不過在腦裏有了一個影像、以爲這是「範疇」而已、</p>
<p>雖然、畢竟也發現了幾本東西、朱光潛的給青年的十二封信、舒新城的致青年書、内容都還不差、這裏、又發現了第三本、夏瑞民的「致青年」我將熱誠地介紹於諸位可敬愛的青年之前、</p>
<p>作者是一個剛剛經過「青年」的階段而將踏上「壯年」的人、凡一般人所經過的美麗的青春、他也算是經歷到了、而且還没有完全脫離、有一個不會立刻遺失的影像映在他的腦裏、他便將牠奔放了出來、寫成功了這本書、</p>
<p>因此這書、他會變「給青年的十二封信」更充實些、比「致青年書」更親切些、</p>
<p>作者是一個眞實而勇敢的青年、他說、「我根本不承認世間上有甚麽天才、聰明人、他們都是環境使他們如此的、我認爲經騐之獲得、才是不欺騙的「正確」、我勸一般青年們不要希望做「超人」、還是嚴重些脚踏實地去做、」當這國難當頭、一般徬徨的青年還在莫知所措的時候、這本書足以使他感到興奮、至少能指示他有一條正確的路線可走、</p>
<p>人是絕對受着環境和歷史支配着的、在什麽一個時代是産生出什麽一種青年、作者也逃不出這個範圍因此他也曾享過樂、吃過苦、經歷過種種的事情、他很想將這些事、留給後路人看看、將自己眞正切身所經歷到的寫下來、作一個青年在某一個時代下的歷史的記載、所以他說、</p>
<p>「往前、當我在青年的時代、我也曾高談過學業、追求過戀愛、參加過各種運動、喜出鋒頭、想做文學家、總之一般青年所默冀着的、我也逃不出這個範圍的、到了最近、自己很想把以前所走過的路、留一個痕跡、在自己、算作是一個紀念、次大的原因、我想虔誠地貢獻於現代諸可愛的青年之前、作爲第一次的見面禮、因爲這些是我片斷的個人的心得、不敢怎樣誇大地說、祗能說是自己在青年旅程中的一些紀録、給現代諸青年的一個忠實的訴狀而已、」因此我們知道作者如何地要把他一顆赤心獻出來呢、</p>
<p>本書的特點、便是表現出作者渡過「青春之橋」處處在艱難困苦之中、各種惡劣的環境在引誘着他、脆弱的青春的心不容易避開這些惡魔的、因此作者也便身嘗到這些、但惟其因環境在使他陷落、愈足以鍜鍊他他强烈的精神、環境在在使得他陷落、但他不屈不撓的意志、處處去應付牠、當他在過着青年的時候是不覺得怎樣、但他當年紀大了一些便覺得他是渡過了幾許的險橋、回想起來、使得他寒心、所以他寫這本書的目的、就是同青年們說、擺在你們前的是怎樣的一條路、你們將怎樣去留心應付才是、所以他說「……并且現在有許多在黑暗中摸索的青年們看了這一些先進者（先比你們在黑暗中摸索的一個）的記録或許也不無可補吧、」</p>
<p>所以本書猶是一本青春的自傳、作者苦心地把自己所身歷而先經到的、供之於年紀較輕的一般青年、使他們看看先進者究竟走着了什麽一條路、遭遇着怎樣的情形、然後或許在他自己的途程中、能比較走得穏當一些、實際一些、</p>
<p>作者又深深地瞭解到現在的一般青年發生了時代的發悶、因此他又用一種勉勵的口氣去領導青年走上正當的道途、他說、</p>
<p>「時代的波浪固然時刻的在掀起巨潮來、使各個的青年都迷離的走向象牙之塔還是走向十字街頭的交界線上、但我們不要聽信了人家的宣言、便恍惑得莫知所措、我們只有盡我們自己的責任、把持了時代、自前幹去……」</p>
<p>本書特别偏重的、是對一般少年文人、作者看得他們喜歡文學、固然是可喜的、但頗有些人動不動即喜歡創作、就頗有些危險了、所以他說、</p>
<p>「文學究竟是一種藝術、他所需要的乃是一般通暢的文字與訓練的文字、而尤其需要的乃是爲一般藝術上的生命的、熱情與天才、這熱情與天才的養成、便要有要實的文學的修養……」</p>
<p>本書的辭藻亦美麗非常、使人讀下來頗快感、他在每一篇中總會用一些風韻的句子來調節、</p>
<p>「健夫、今天天氣很和暖、小河從山坡上流下漣漪的淺波、在日光中、閃耀着、校園裏舖滿了初春的嫩緑、薔薇樹和白楊樹正開着生長、嫩葉透着微緑、四處有小鳥歌唱、鄕間空氣中生出一種春的氣息、無限的歡樂臨照着靜寂的太空、一切精力都要從大地上生長起來了、」又如、</p>
<p>「……户外在流水、清澈的泉聲震動了我的心靈、因此使我憶起了你……」</p>
<p>總之、│本書是一個純潔眞誠的青年所吐露心聲、而變成一部經騐的指導、並非一般空泛的議論可比、</p>
<p>末了、我引作者的話作結、</p>
<p>「當你曉得是春來了、尤其不要忘記你是一個青年、應在青年的時候加倍努力、我勸你放下左手一杯醇酒、舉起右手來進行進行、」</p>

<h3>Continued Disturbances in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Plainclothes Troops Riot Again from the Night Before Last, Engaging in Street Battles with Security Forces</p>
<p>At 7 AM Yesterday, They Collapsed and Retreat, Japanese Troops in the Japanese Concession Firing Cannons in Two Locations to Provide Support</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Starting at 11 PM on the 10th, plainclothes troops began a fierce attack. At 2 AM on the 11th, Japanese troops fired cannons in two locations at the Haiguang Temple gate to provide support. The disturbances continued until 7 AM on the 11th, when they retreated in disarray into the Japanese concession. The investigation is as follows: On the night of the 10th, the French concession dug trenches, piled up earthworks, and erected electric fences at the Sino-Japanese border in the western gate area, dispatching Annamite soldiers to defend it. The deployment was completed at 1:30 AM on the 11th, with four tanks on guard. District 6, Section 1 was attacked by over a hundred plainclothes troops at 1:30 AM on the 11th, resulting in a fierce two-hour battle. They collapsed and retreated to Guangxin Lane in Nankai, Xiatou in the Southern Gate, Xiyingmen, Ximenlian, the west station of the Jinpu Railway, etc. Groups of 30-50 plainclothes troops were discovered in each location. At that time, gunfire erupted, and the entire city was plunged into extreme terror and chaos. By dawn, they retreated to the gate, Japanese soldiers firing over twenty cannons. Japanese soldiers fired two cannons from the roof of the Zhongyuan Company building and set up a radio station. Seven sections of the southeastern corner of the city were destroyed by cannon fire. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Near Haiguang Temple in Tianjin, gunfire suddenly erupted at 9 PM on the 10th, approximately 400-500 rounds, interspersed with intense machine gun fire, resembling a signal. At 11 PM, gunfire erupted again in the 300-meter zone between the Sino-Japanese border. Small groups of rioters were discovered attacking the security forces in that area, but were quickly repelled by the security forces. At 1:45 AM this morning, approximately 150 rioters were discovered in the Nankai Middle School area, clashing with the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and 4th squadrons of the local security forces. The intense fighting continued until 3 AM. The situation is even more serious than the previous night. It is reported that the French garrison has been mobilized and is on alert in the Laoximen area. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: (1) At 2:07 AM this morning, a cannon shell from the Japanese concession struck the Meiyi Meihui Zhongxi Girls' School outside the southern gate. (2) At 3:20 AM, an armored car suddenly rushed into the jurisdiction of District 6, Section 2 in the southern city, firing repeatedly with live ammunition at our security forces and police, but failed. (3) While the rioters were engaged in battle with our security forces and police near Nankai, the lights in the Nankai area suddenly went out, and both sides groped in the dark, attacking each other. (4) Several Japanese howitzers were set up on the roof of the Zhongyuan Company building in the Japanese concession, with their muzzles pointed at the Chinese territory. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 12 AM last night, plainclothes troops in Tianjin gathered in the Japanese concession. One group set off for the southeastern corner of the city, while another group went to the gate. The group that went to the gate was led by Japanese individuals. Five plainclothes troops were killed on the spot in front of the Public Security Bureau. The Japanese were temporarily detained as evidence for negotiations. Four plainclothes troops died at the southeastern corner of the city, including one Korean. Our police also suffered casualties. Because our side's resistance was effective, the rioters changed their attack route. One group attempted to break through the Italian concession to attack Hedong, while another group attempted to attack District 3 via the Wanguo Bridge. However, due to the Italian and French troops setting up machine guns at key points and being on high alert, the rioters failed. Gunfire continued incessantly. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Starting at 4 AM this morning, Japanese troops at Haiguang Temple in Tianjin fired cannons northward every few minutes, bombarding the city and the Hebei area. The bombardment continued until 6 AM. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the night of the 10th, Japanese soldiers used four small motorboats to demonstrate back and forth on the Hai River. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fifty plainclothes troops were discovered at the Huaxin Textile Factory on the night of the 10th and were routed. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Commander Zhang Xueliang's headquarters reported that armed insurgents and police clashed again in Tianjin at night. The location was 300 meters outside the Japanese concession, the area where the Japanese authorities demanded the withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese soldiers and police last Sunday. The insurgents initially numbered only 30-50, firing at the police, but soon a large number of insurgents appeared. The Japanese fired mortars, with several shells landing near an American church. At 3:20 AM this morning, an armored car drove out from the Japanese concession and exchanged fire with Chinese police. The gunfire only subsided at 5 AM this morning. All concessions summoned foreign troops for defense. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is now learned from reliable sources that the rumor of a Japanese destroyer firing on the Tanggu Railway Station yesterday is untrue. The disturbed area is now very peaceful. However, civilians without special passes are not allowed to go out. It is reported that the local authorities have searched for insurgents hiding in a certain location. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of the Japanese Concession in Tianjin Are Extremely Panicked</h3>
<p>The Main Valve of the Concession's Water Supply is Closed, Retired Japanese Soldiers Disguised as Plainclothes Troops</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7 AM this morning, Commander Kashi of the Japanese military ordered Japanese women and children to take refuge in the Japanese military camps, and Japanese men to go to the retired soldiers' association to await dispatch. At noon, the main valve of the concession's water supply was closed, causing great panic among Chinese merchants and residents. After negotiations, the Suma Street exit was opened. Seeing Chinese people swarm in like ants, the French concession authorities, fearing it would affect the French concession's security, added to the obstruction. The Chinese had no choice but to return to the Japanese concession. According to intelligence, the entire body of retired Japanese soldiers is disguised as plainclothes troops, scheduled to launch a general attack on the provincial and municipal governments and the Public Security Bureau on the night of the 11th. All friendly nations are aware of this conspiracy. The British, French, and Italian concessions have stepped up security. The French concession announced that transportation will be cut off from 9 PM on the 11th to 6 AM the next morning, and pedestrians are prohibited. Chinese territory will implement martial law starting at 2 PM on the 11th. At Paotaizhuang and Wandezhuang, 400-500 plainclothes troops were surrounded by security forces on the morning of the 10th. The encirclement continued until the morning of the 11th when dozens of Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived and took the plainclothes troops away. The municipal authorities granted the merchants' request, and from 10 AM to 1 PM on the morning of the 11th, the police protected residents to go to the streets to buy food. By 5 PM on the evening of the 11th, over a thousand Japanese had completed their disguise and were waiting in the Japanese military camp to launch an attack. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese concession in Tianjin is full of Japanese soldiers who are extremely insulting to the Chinese. The area bordering the Japanese and French concessions was passable this afternoon. Chinese territory was under martial law at 4 PM. All stores opened at 10 AM and closed at 3 PM. There were very few pedestrians on the streets. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, two hundred Chinese children, each carrying a basket of belongings in one hand and a quilt in the other, fled from Chinese territory into the British concession. They were accommodated in a certain school building. However, the number of Chinese fleeing into foreign concessions this time is not as large as in previous local disturbances. It seems that this disturbance is limited to the city of Tianjin, and there are no major disturbances in the countryside. It is reported that the Japanese destroyer No. 16 appeared off Dagu tonight and fired four shots in the direction of Tanggu Railway Station, but this report has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Plainclothes Troop Fugitives Escorted to Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, three major plainclothes troop fugitives captured in Tianjin were escorted to Beiping in an armored car to be interrogated by the Vice Minister. Two of them were Koreans. After interrogation by Tang Guozhen, the chief of the deputy official's office, Zhang Xueliang personally questioned them. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xueming arrived at the Public Security Bureau at noon on the 10th and interrogated the plainclothes troops, immediately executing one of them. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Tianjin disturbances have subsided this morning. The two leaders of the insurgents have been captured and are being escorted to Beiping by armored train. Other captured insurgents will also be escorted to Beiping for interrogation. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Beiping Announces Martial Law</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Beiping will be under martial law tonight. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Tianjin turmoil has not yet subsided, and there are rumors that Japanese are planning to provoke disturbances in Beiping on the 16th. However, our military and police authorities have made sufficient preparations and are taking extra precautions, so security can be guaranteed. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Over two hundred Nankai students arrived in Beiping tonight. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Report on Tianjin Incident Investigation by a Western Newspaper Reporter</h3>
<p>The Guns in the Hands of the Plainclothes Troops Were Made by the Liaoning Arsenal</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Western newspaper reporter went to Tianjin to investigate the truth of this incident and returned to Beiping yesterday. Here are a few excerpts from his report: (1) After a fierce battle with the Chinese security forces at Haiguang Temple, the rioters occupied the Sixth Precinct of Special District Two and immediately raised the Japanese flag, ordering that any Chinese military or police passing through the area be sprayed with machine-gun fire. (2) When the rioters rushed into Chinese territory, they were protected by the Japanese army. The Japanese side installed sandbags, strictly guarded the Sino-Japanese border, and issued martial law, prohibiting any armed Chinese from entering the concession. However, after the rioters were defeated, they retreated and gathered in the Japanese concession. (3) A visit to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau revealed many guns and bullets, taken from a freight car with the Japanese Municipal Bureau license plate and Tianjin number 125, which had been seized from the rioters. Zhang Xueming pointed to a rifle, saying that it was made by the Liaoning Arsenal, model 1924, and that no army had ever used a single one. It was discovered during this incident after the Japanese occupied the arsenal. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Wang Shuchang Talks About Defense</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Shuchang told a reporter, "I have a responsibility to defend the territory and will not be afraid to avoid it. Chairman Chiang sends telegrams every day, instructing me and Mayor Zhang to defend strictly. Deputy Zhang uses long-distance telephone to instruct on strategies. The plainclothes troops would not be difficult to suppress without the secret assistance of the Japanese soldiers." (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Xiansheng, the director of the Northeast Police Department, and Bai Baoshan arrived in Tianjin this morning. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Beijing Daobao Announces the Inside Story of the Tianjin Riot</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Beijing Daobao will publish an editorial tomorrow, announcing that there is no doubt that this Tianjin riot was organized by the Japanese. Since the Japanese concession has been used as a starting point for attacks on Chinese territory, other powers should take over the concession and entrust China to govern it. The Japanese embassy claims that the riot originated in Chinese territory and accuses the Chinese authorities of disregarding agreements by allowing soldiers to approach within thirty miles of the Japanese concession and open fire on the Japanese concession. The water tower in the Japanese concession was hit by dozens of bullets and is now leaking water. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Discovered in Jixing</h3>
<p>Perhaps a Detour to Attack Heilongjiang Army, Battle Near Taoangzi</p>
<p>(Harbin) No movement from Japanese and Zhang Haipeng's troops on the 8th and 9th. However, Japanese newspapers reported that Japanese soldiers declared that not overthrowing the Heilongjiang provincial government and defeating Ma Zhanshan would be a failure and shame for this military expedition, so the future may not be uneventful. On the 9th, Japanese and Zhang's troops appeared in Jixing, 50 li from the Fularji station on the East Road, presumably taking a detour to attack. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the morning of the 9th, over a thousand troops were discovered 60 li south of the Taoang Road. It has not been confirmed whether they are enemy troops. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 7 PM on the 10th, over a thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry were discovered between the Feicaigou and Sijia areas in front of our army on the Taoang Line, approximately 15 li from our defense line, and have not yet opened fire. The defender of that area is the Wu Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Harbin) At 6 PM on the 9th, approximately 700 Japanese troops and Zhang Haipeng's detachments appeared near Taoangzi, 30 li from Danglaji, and opened fire with the Zhang Battalion of our First Brigade Infantry, engaging in a fierce battle for half an hour, after which the enemy retreated. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Casualties of Japanese Troops in Battle on Taoang Road</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese side announced that in the Taoang Road battles, 30 died on the 4th, 70 on the 5th, 30 on the 6th, and 37 on the 7th, for a total of 167 dead. Over 600 were wounded. The number of deaths in Zhang Haipeng's army was over 700. The Japanese side avoids admitting defeat to our army, claiming that there are Russian troops within the Heilongjiang Army. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Replenishing Military Supplies, Planning to Attack Heilongjiang Army Again</h3>
<p>Heilongjiang Army Building Covered Trenches on the Front Line</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese army is actively replenishing military supplies, planning to attack our army on the Taoang Line again. Domen, the commander of the Second Division, arrived in Taonan on the 9th to command the Bai Yongsheng and Fu Jingfen regiments of Zhang Haipeng's army. On the evening of the 9th, they had already made contact with the National Salvation Army. Zhang's army did not gain any advantage and has continued to send a cavalry regiment to assist. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Heilongjiang Army is building covered trenches on the Taoang Line. The soldiers live in the trenches every day, strictly defending against the enemy and are determined to defend for a long time. However, winter clothing is lacking, and all sectors of Harbin are raising funds to purchase woolen sweaters. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan told visiting foreign reporters that he was forced to resist this time due to pressure from the Japanese army. He will do his best to lead his troops to defend the country in the future. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs on Jiangqiao</h3>
<p>(Harbin) At 1 PM on the 10th, two Japanese planes flew to our Jiangqiao defense line and dropped over thirty bombs. Three of our soldiers and three horses were killed by the bombing. Many of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes in front of our army did not explode and had the words "Made in Showa 6th Year" on them. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>A Japanese Plane Shot Down at Angangxi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, several planes dropped numerous bombs on our Angangxi position. Our army used anti-aircraft artillery to shoot down one plane, killing one Japanese pilot. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Issues Ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Demanding Declaration of Attitude Toward Japan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreigners received a telegram from Harbin stating that the commander of the Japanese garrison in Nenjiang issued an ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan on the 8th, requesting Ma to declare his attitude toward Japan within 24 hours. Ma attempted to negotiate with the Japanese side, inquiring as to what the Japanese side meant by the various points mentioned. The Japanese side replied that the war must cease, and that if Ma could not maintain order and protect peace, he should resign and cede power to Zhang Haipeng. It is said that the second line of Chinese defense is at Sanjianfang, and the third line of defense is along the Chinese Eastern Railway north of Angangxi. Therefore, if war occurs and the Chinese troops retreat to the third line, the railway will inevitably be destroyed, which could cause problems for Soviet Russia. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Strong Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding Japanese Army's Large-Scale Invasion of Heilongjiang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese army's large-scale invasion of Heilongjiang in recent days and its unwillingness to withdraw troops are now extremely clear. In addition to having telegraphed Shi Zhaoji to convey the matter to the League of Nations regarding the Japanese army's attack on our army at the Nenjiang Bridge, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with Japan on the 10th. On the 10th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced its note as follows:</p>
<p>It has been verified that the Japanese army has occupied various parts of eastern provinces by force this time. After the League of Nations Council passed a resolution on withdrawal of troops, the Chinese government believed that the Japanese government would abide by the resolution and withdraw troops immediately. However, for several weeks, the Japanese army has not only shown no intention of withdrawing troops, but has also continued to expand its illegal actions, blatantly disregarding world public opinion. The Chinese government and people have already been deeply surprised, and Japan has recently sent troops to Heilongjiang Province under the pretext of repairing the Nenjiang Bridge, which Japan has no right to repair. On the 2nd of this month, Lin Yixiu, the representative of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, demanded that Chinese troops withdraw from the Nenjiang Bridge to ten kilometers away. At that time, the original stationing place of the Chinese troops was very far from Benjiang Bridge. However, the Japanese army repeatedly forced forward and coerced Zhang Haipeng to gather a crowd, while fiercely attacking Chinese troops. Therefore, it had no choice but to take necessary measures for legitimate defense. According to reports, Japanese troops have occupied Daxing Station, and multiple planes have flown to Xiaoxiaoqiao, south of Angangxi on the Chinese Eastern Railway, dropping bombs and constantly bombing our troops' garrisons along the way. Lin Yixiu even notified Chairman Ma on the 8th, stating that if he wished to avoid the disaster of the Japanese army entering Qiqihar, the only solution was for Chairman Ma to step down immediately and hand over power to Zhang Haipeng. The Japanese army's actions are undoubtedly aimed at using traitors to occupy the provincial capital of Heilongjiang in order to create the same situation as in Liaoning and Jilin. The Japanese army's aggressive behavior not only violates international law and international conventions, but also violates the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations. The Japanese government's responsibility is even greater, and it should immediately stop this illegal behavior and quickly implement the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations. As for the damage caused to the Chinese government and people by this action of the Japanese army in Heilongjiang Province, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for compensation, just as it does for the damage caused in other places. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Tianjin incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side based on reports from local officials. The Special Foreign Affairs Committee was still meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 4 PM on the 11th. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 10th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with Japan against the Japanese army's invasion of Heilongjiang. In addition to having the Asian Department send personnel to deliver it to Kamimura, the Japanese Consul in Beijing, for forwarding to Shighemitsu, the Japanese Ambassador, it also telegraphed Minister Jiang Zuobin, instructing him to submit it to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and conduct serious negotiations. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Xi Qia Releases Prisoners</h3>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Cables the Course of Resisting the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Demands Ma Zhanshan Cede Political Power</p>
<p>▲ Longjiang Ma Zhanshan and Xie Ke's Circular Telegram Reads: All Newspaper Offices Please Take Notice, Ever Since the Liaoning and Jilin Incident, the Japanese Army Has Been Determined to Seize Jiang Province, Using Every Possible Means to Achieve Its So-Called Plan. At First, It Incited Zhang Haipeng's Army to Invade the North, Acting as Its Puppet. Our Army Was Ordered to Stop the Mutinous Army, and as a Last Resort, Tore Down Several Sections of the Jiangqiao Bridge on the Taoang Road. The Plot Did Not Succeed, So It Sent Its Major Staff Officer Lin Yixiu to Jiang, Using the Taoang Road Jiangqiao Bridge, Where Japan Has Creditor Relations, as the Reason to Lead the Japanese Consul to Negotiate with Me, Proposing That the South Manchuria Railway Restore It, and Demanding That Our Army Withdraw Fifteen Huari from the Jiangqiao Bridge. Zhang's Army Also Agreed. After Investigating, Our Army Was Originally Stationed at the Daxing Station, Eighteen Huari From the Jiangqiao Bridge, Which Does Not Conflict with the Request. The Major Also Stated at the Same Time That the Japanese Army Would Never Take Military Action Except to Protect Workers Repairing the Bridge. For the Sake of Respecting the League of Nations Resolution and Avoiding Giving the Japanese Army an Excuse, Our Army Endured, Complying with the Request, Inexplicably, and Powerlessly. The Army Suddenly Threw Bombs at Our Daxing Garrison on the Night of the 3rd. For the Sake of Peace, I Requested Both Sides Avoid Conflict with Consul Shimizu. Then, at 8 AM on the Morning of the Branch, Colonel Shi Lanbin Accompanied the Major to Jiangqiao to Survey, and Urge Both Sides to Withdraw to Avoid Misunderstanding and to Facilitate Construction. When the Army Was Ordered to Begin Moving to the Rear, and Lin and Others Had Just Left Jiangqiao, the Japanese Army Took Advantage of the Opportunity to Capture Three of Our Alert Sentries and Discover Acts of Provocation. After Negotiations Until 3 PM, the Major, Accompanied by Secretary Zaoqi of the Consulate, Was Accompanied by Our Secretary Han Shuye and Deputy Officer Lian Su, Taking a Special Car Together to Jiangqiao for Inspection. As Soon as the Special Car Passed the Daxing Station, It Was Greeted by Several Japanese Aircraft, Which Threw Bombs and Deputy Officer Na Was Wounded by the Bombing and the Special Car Could Not Move Forward. Lin and Others Returned to the Provincial Capital, That Is, the Japanese Army in Front Was Fiercely Attacking Me. The Soldiers of Our Army, Filled with Grief and Anger, Could Not Be Restrained, and Had No Choice but to Use Justifiable Self-Defense to Slightly Suppress the Enemy's Edge, to Protect the Ancestral Homeland, and to Preserve the Personality of the Chinese People, Vowing to Throw Away Blood and Heads, and Not Caring About the Strength of the Enemy. Zhanshan and Others Still Strove to Maintain the Principle of Peace When There Was No Other Way, Strictly Ordering the Soldiers to Only Defend and Not Attack. The Major Lin Saw Such Actions of the Japanese Army, Not Only Did He Not Stop Them, but He Threatened Our Army Even More, to Cede Jiang Province, All to Be Slaughtered by Them. Alas, This Attack on Daxing Was Done by Over Four Thousand Japanese Soldiers Wearing Yellow Clothes and Copper Hats, With Over Forty Cannons, Seven or Eight Planes, and Three Armored Trains. The Soldiers Crossing the River to Attack Did Not Include Zhang Haipeng's Army. Zhang Has Been Advised Repeatedly, Stating That He Has Awakened, and That the Feeling of Being Fooled and Oppressed by the Japanese Army Is Also Evident Here. Since Noon on the Branch, the Japanese Army Has Begun to Attack Our Army, From Artillery Fire Below to Airplanes Above, Both Land and Air, Extremely Fierce. Our Soldiers Resisted Death and Were Not Subdued, Shedding Blood Horizontally and Continuing Efforts. Zhanshan and Others Found Daxing Difficult to Defend and Could Not Bear to See the Soldiers Put All Their Eggs in One Basket, so Maji Ordered on the Day to Protect Each Other From Left and Right, and Retreat to the Area Around the Sanjianfang Station, Fifty Huari From the Jiangqiao Bridge, to Consolidate the Defense. On the 8th, the Major Lin Held the Notice of Commander Honjo, Ordering Zhanshan to Quickly Transfer the Political Power of Jiang Province to Zhang Haipeng, Otherwise the Japanese Army Would Occupy the City of Heilongjiang Province, Which Is Still Under Negotiation Now. In This Campaign, Due to the Lack of Air Defense Weapons, There Were As Many As Five or Six Hundred Casualties Among Officers and Soldiers. Although the Morale Has Not Been Discouraged, It Is Still Very Exhilarated. Now, in the Snowy Land and Frozen Sky, All the Facts in Defense Are Seen and Heard by All Sectors of the Local Area, That Is, They Are Also Seen by the People of All Friendly Nations. I Am Sincerely Afraid That the Japanese Side Will Subvert the Responsibility, Deceiving People and Deceiving Themselves, and Because the People of the Whole Country Are Eagerly Watching, This Fact of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Northern Manchuria Is Contrary to Its Declaration. I Hereby Declare the Circumstances of the Beginning and the End to the Middle and Foreign Countries, So as to Clarify the Truth and Determine Right and Wrong. Zhanshan and Others Have a Duty to Defend the Territory and Have the Same Patriotism. Knowing That the Isolated Army in the Frontier Fortress Is Difficult to Resist the Strong Japan, However, Because the Survival Is Related and Justice Is Concerned, How Can We Not Deal with It and Sit and Wait for Death, Supporting the Thread of Five Hundred of Tian Heng, and the Sincerity of One Brigade of Shaokang, We Must First Go to the National Disaster With Our Compatriots. Special Telegram Is Offered. Please Inspect It. Ma Zhanshan and Xie Ke Bow Their Heads and Sprinkle Ash. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Disturbance Was Purely Instigated by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Reports to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chief Chinese Representative Shi Reported the Recent Disturbances in Tianjin to the Board of Directors Today, Stating That the Bleeding and Disturbance in Tianjin This Time Was Another Step in Japan's Policy of Using Chinese Evil Elements to Brew Rebellion. On the 7th and 8th of This Month, the Tianjin Authorities Had Received Reports That the Japanese Had Decided to Take Advantage of Those Who Were Against the National Government Among the Chinese to Disrupt the Security of Beiping and Tianjin Before the Board of Directors Reopened on November 16. The Japanese in Tianjin Had Issued Five Hundred Pieces of Small Military Equipment to These Chinese, and on the Night of the 8th, Two Thousand People Holding Japanese Flags Rushed Out of the Japanese Concession, Trying to Occupy the Provincial Government and the Public Security Bureau. Thirty Cannons Were Fired From the Japanese Concession Toward Chinese Territory, but Were Repelled by the Police. Now the Japanese Falsely Claim That This Incident Was a Conflict Between the Soldiers of the 29th Brigade of Jilin and the Tianjin Police. They Do Not Know That There Are No Jilin Troops in Tianjin, and There Is No 29th Brigade in the Jilin Troops. The Theory Is Self-Defeating. (Kuomintang News Agency Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese Representative Published an Article, Saying That the Tianjin Disturbance Was That Japanese Authorities Instigated Scoundrels to Revolt. Two Thousand People Holding Japanese Flags Rushed From the Japanese Concession Into Chinese Territory to Attack the Police Station. Later, When the Chinese Police Respected the Request of the Japanese Authorities and Withdrew Three Hundred Meters From the Border of the Japanese Concession, the City of Tianjin Was Shelled More Than Thirty Times. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Statement by Shi Zhaoji Regarding the Suspension of Armaments Production Proposal</h3>
<p>Dependent on the Future of the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Dr. Shi, the Chinese representative, sent a letter to the League of Nations in response to the proposal to suspend armaments production for one year. He stated that China could agree to the proposal but said that issues such as the suspension of armaments production and the disarmament conference must depend on a satisfactory resolution of the Manchurian problem. If the supports for peace, such as the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, were unfortunately to collapse, then China would have no choice but to consider other national affairs as secondary and instead prioritize the construction of strong national defenses, sufficient to maintain our territorial integrity and political independence, and to resist foreign aggression. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Japanese representative sent two letters to the League of Nations, referring to the actions of Chinese troops near Angangxi. They stated that approximately 30,000 Chinese soldiers, with 31 cannons, were assembled near the Japanese army's outer哨 line on the Nen River, with supporting troops continuing to arrive. They requested that the League of Nations pay attention to the potential dangers in this situation. If the Chinese troops, relying on a ten-to-one numerical advantage, were to engage in acts of war, then a very serious situation would arise. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Birthday During National Crisis and the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. The Kuomintang's Fourth National Congress in Nanjing also officially opens today. Holding such an important meeting on a day of great and glorious commemoration further highlights its significance. At the same time, the nation faces a multitude of crises. The people are drowning in floods, the country is threatened by powerful enemies, the situation is precarious, and crises are emerging all around. The opening of the Fourth National Congress today further highlights the enormous difficulty of its responsibilities.</p>
<p>What we find regrettable today is that the Chinese Kuomintang, founded by Sun Yat-sen, has failed to maintain solid unity and consistent action in recent years. Even today, Nanjing and Guangdong are still holding their respective Fourth National Congresses. This is truly an unfortunate phenomenon. However, if both sides can hold their meetings and truly cooperate, and if, after the meetings, both sides sincerely work together for permanent unity, then the temporary shadow will not detract from the brightness of the sun. This would be a great blessing not only for the future of the Kuomintang but also something on which the future of our nation deeply relies.</p>
<p>We are experiencing national difficulties and our hearts are filled with worry. After silently observing the situation, we respectfully submit several points for the Congress's consideration.</p>
<p>First, Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated himself to revolution for forty years, accumulating his experience and knowledge. He personally formulated the Three Principles of the People and the Founding Strategies. The depth of his theory and the breadth of his insights are truly the key to saving China. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the responsibility for promoting and developing the Three Principles of the People and realizing the Founding Strategies lies entirely with those who adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, that is, with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's only legacy, the Chinese Kuomintang. In various countries around the world, the thoughts and propositions of revolutionary leaders during their lifetimes are mostly studied, explained, and developed by their disciples and followers after their deaths. However, since Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death and the Kuomintang's unification of the country, followers of Sun Yat-senism have been diligently engaged in politics, and very few people have paid attention to the work of organizing and clarifying Sun Yat-senism. The division of leaders and internal party disputes over the years, as well as the obscuring of the principles, are the main causes of this. Therefore, from now on, those who adhere to Sun Yat-senism and the members of the Chinese Kuomintang who practice the Three Principles of the People should, at least some of them, shift their enthusiasm from politics to the study of the Three Principles of the People in order to clarify the principles, unify the theory, and complete Dr. Sun Yat-sen's unfinished legacy.</p>
<p>Second, revolutionary party members should only have sacrifice and absolutely no enjoyment of happiness. If there is any, it should be on the day of the revolution's success, after all the people have obtained happiness. People who have traveled to the Soviet Union have praised the Bolshevik Party members for their hardship. Party members, as individuals, have almost no rights to speak of, and this spirit is extremely admirable. Today, the revolution of the Three Principles of the People has not yet succeeded, and the people's suffering has not yet been alleviated. However, the rights and comforts enjoyed by Kuomintang members may exceed those of the people. The ruling party bears a difficult responsibility. "The revolution has not yet succeeded, and party members still need to work hard." Enjoying rights is not yet the time. To worry before the people worry and to rejoice after the people rejoice is to be truly worthy of a revolutionary party member. Therefore, this Fourth National Congress should pay attention to correcting the mentality of party members seeking comfort and encourage their spirit of struggle in order to promote the National Revolution and bring it to an early success.</p>
<p>Third, the principles and policies of a political party, if it wants to win the sympathy and support of the broad masses, should not rely on empty slogans, but on the demonstration of facts. What the people demand are real and concrete facts, not empty promises. Before this Fourth National Congress, the Kuomintang has already held three representative congresses. Let's not talk about the first two. Even the resolutions of the Third Congress have accumulated into a huge volume. Plans have been determined for both domestic affairs and foreign relations. However, if we examine them today, have they all been implemented? Gathering the elite of the entire party, we are not worried about the lack of resolutions, but about the inability to implement the resolutions. It is better to take action than to sit and talk. The Kuomintang after taking power should pay even more attention to this. Therefore, this Congress should strictly review past achievements and, even more importantly, mobilize all party members to strive for the realization of the resolutions of this Congress.</p>
<p>Fourth, the country is currently facing unprecedented difficulties. Disaster relief for floods, recovery of vitality, recovery of lost territories in the Northeast, and resistance to violent and powerful neighbors all urgently require our government to lead the people in joint efforts. What's more, earlier, world figures speculated that the outbreak of World War II would either be in the Far East or in Western Europe, and their views were not consistent. Since the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, world opinion has unanimously determined that the Far East issue is the powder keg for a second war and is unavoidable. Our country is the center of the Far East issue. If a major war unfortunately breaks out one day and our country has no way to fight, then the country's future will be unimaginable. Therefore, the most important mission of this Congress is how to overcome the current national crisis and how to deal with the future international situation. There should be comprehensive plans for both domestic and foreign affairs, so that we can stabilize our country amidst the turmoil.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Secretary-General's Representative to Visit Japan to Inquire About True Intentions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Walter, an official from the Secretariat of the League of Nations in China, will travel from Shanghai to Tokyo as a special envoy of Secretary-General Drummond. He is expected to arrive in Tokyo on the 12th. The purpose of Walter's trip is to meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara and inquire about Japan's true intentions in order to find a way for the League of Nations to resolve the situation. The public is paying close attention to the results of this meeting. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japan Reinforces Troops in Eastern Provinces; Four Japanese Warships Head to Lushun</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan is currently sending a division of troops to Manchuria as reinforcements, scheduled to depart on the 15th. (Guomin News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The return of the Korean Army to its original unit and the dispatch of divisions from mainland Japan to Manchuria were announced by the Ministry of the Army this afternoon. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Naval Minister, who was with the Emperor in Kyushu for naval exercises, is now returning to Tokyo due to the possible developments in the North China situation. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Four destroyers are currently sailing from the Wu naval port to Lushun, and one cruiser from Sasebo is heading to Yokosuka today to await orders. This movement of warships is reportedly due to the increasingly serious situation in North China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received an official report this evening regarding the riots in Tianjin, stating that this is purely a conflict between Chinese people and that Japanese soldiers are not involved. However, military authorities have already made preparations for security to protect the Japanese concession. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A mixed brigade of the Eighth Division stationed in the northern part of Japan has now been approved by the Emperor to be transferred to Manchuria. Departure orders have been issued today. The brigade will replace the mixed brigade that went to Manchuria from Korea on September 19th. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japan to Further Propose Joint Control of China; Japanese Officials' Absurd Arguments; Cabinet Resolves to Stand Firm</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The attitude Japan should take when the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvenes on October 16 to discuss the Manchurian Incident has been clarified today. Officials stated that Japan will not make any concessions or slightly alter the five basic principles it proposed during the previous council meeting as the basis for a solution, which must be acknowledged by China. Japan will also further make the Administrative Council understand that only foreigners can give China a faithful government and plan a method for foreigners to manage China, so as to guarantee peace and order, good administration, and the necessity of respecting treaties. Japanese public opinion is mostly pessimistic about the outcome of the League of Nations meeting. However, officials seem to believe that if the League of Nations does not act hastily, then the outlook for Japan will not be bad. According to the opinion of today's spokesperson for the officials, Japan initially assumed that the world already knew that China's national policy was to abolish or disregard its so-called unequal treaties. Now, it realizes that this assumption was a mistake and will work to correct the previous error. The method is not to explain its own behavior but to focus on explaining the past history of the dispute, so that the League of Nations will understand the necessity of a fundamental solution. Japan will submit to the League of Nations a list of China's violations of treaty rights and strive to make the League of Nations understand that to have a faithful government in China, there must be some form of foreign intervention. If the League of Nations agrees with Japan's view and China truly has the sincerity to trust the League of Nations, then China should immediately agree to this plan. Japanese officials also said that the Manchurian problem is a matter of life and death for Japan and will never change its previously proposed demands. The rumors that Japan will comply with the scope when the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvenes are not true. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting today to discuss how to deal with the League of Nations Council meeting in Paris on the 16th. After careful consultation, the following policy was decided:</p>
<p>Regardless of the attitude the League of Nations takes in the future, Japan will absolutely not withdraw its troops until security in Manchuria is safely maintained. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, a National Assembly on the External Situation was held in Shiba Park, with over 8,000 people attending. A declaration of a firm foreign policy was resolved, and it was decided to send representatives to deliver this resolution to the Prime Minister, various ministers, and diplomats from League of Nations member states. (Jiji News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Stimson Plans to Devise a Plan, Hoping to End the Sino-Japanese Dispute After Implementation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials in the US government are very concerned about the constant reports of minor conflicts between Chinese and Japanese troops in the Three Northeastern Provinces, as well as the tense situation in Tianjin, where order has not yet been fully restored. It has recently been confirmed that Stimson has indeed drafted a plan, hoping to end the Sino-Japanese dispute after its implementation. However, its nature remains strictly confidential, and what kind of action will be taken has not been revealed. Today, the State Department received a report from the US Consul in Tianjin that the people in the British and French concessions in Tianjin are very unstable. It is reported that the property of American nationals in the two concessions is worth as much as ten million US dollars, so officials in the US government are quite concerned. In addition, a report was received that after General Ma Zhanshan rejected the Japanese request to withdraw troops to ten kilometers north of Jiangqiao, there were battles along the Tao'an Road. (Guomin News Agency telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>New British Foreign Secretary's Attendance at League of Nations Should Make Significant Contributions; US Government Sends Dawes to Attend</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations is extremely pleased to hear that the new British Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, will personally attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on November 16. It is widely believed that Simon, with his strong capabilities and the prestige of the new British National Government backing him, will be able to join French Prime Minister Briand in making significant contributions to silence the alarm bells that have been ringing here for days. When the Administrative Council meets on the 16th, the United States has been notified. Speakers say that the US Ambassador to France is not currently in Paris, so US Ambassador to the UK Dawes may attend the meeting. This statement has not yet been confirmed, but there is no doubt that US observer Gilbert will attend. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today ordered US Ambassador to the UK General Dawes to represent the United States at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting to be held in Paris on November 16. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon told Ransbury in the Lower House today that he intends to go to Paris to attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. The Council has the famous Briand as Chairman, and with the moral assistance of the United States, it should be able to resolve the unfortunate Manchurian Incident. The Administrative Council has tried to find common ground between the two sides in order to seek a binding resolution. Unfortunately, it has not been completely successful. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the resolution passed has no binding force in law. Sir John Simon also said that since the Administrative Council adjourned, it has continued to try to promote coordination. When the Administrative Council reconvenes, it will carefully continue this effort. He heard that some Japanese troops have withdrawn to the South Manchuria Railway area, but there are battles again in northwestern Manchuria. As for the riots in Tianjin, their meaning is unclear. When the Foreign Secretary announced that he would personally attend the Administrative Council meeting, the entire House cheered. Labor Party MP Thorn asked what the real cause of the Manchurian Incident was, but Sir John Simon refused to answer. He also said that Britain has not sent reinforcements to China. Labor Party MP Griffith asked whether the Foreign Secretary was going to Paris with his usual spirit of peace, and the Foreign Secretary smiled and nodded. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>The Manchurian problem was mentioned in both Houses of Parliament in London today when discussing the British King's Speech. Former Minister of Public Works Lansbury, who is now the leader of the opposition party, declared in the Lower House that both China and Japan are members of the League of Nations, so the British government should clearly inform the Lower House of the measures it has proposed with other countries to end the dispute and avoid further bloodshed. Prime Minister MacDonald did not criticize the Manchurian Incident in his reply but said that he would announce the latest news about the matter tomorrow. Lord Knollys spoke in the Upper House, welcoming the British King's concern for the work of the League of Nations and saying that the League of Nations is currently encountering the most difficult event in its history in its efforts to prevent a major upheaval in the Far East. He hoped that war could be avoided, but if this goal could not be achieved, he hoped that the League of Nations could limit the adverse effects of future events. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Debuchi Explains Attitude Towards China to US Government</h3>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Debuchi today reiterated to the US government his attitude towards China's diplomacy, which has been adopted and must be maintained. This morning, the Japanese ambassador told US Secretary of State Stimson that Japan insists on withdrawing troops only after the safety of Japanese lives and property is guaranteed and normal relations between China and Japan have been restored. The Japanese government may not insist on the final concrete resolution of the 300 outstanding cases between China and Japan, but it requires China to respect the existing treaties regarding the Three Northeastern Provinces. Japanese troops are currently guarding the Nen River Bridge but are not advancing or endangering the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan to Reassign Representative to League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Tokyo on the 11th said that the Japanese government is considering reassigning the Japanese representative to the League of Nations Administrative Council, either Ambassador Yoshida to Italy or Ambassador Matsudaira to the UK. Japan is now planning to organize a large-scale propaganda machine internationally and intends to use the French Paris News to oppose China. (Central News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese in Geneva Pay Attention to Propaganda; Bottles with Anti-Propaganda Items Thrown into Shi Zhaoji's Office</h3>
<p>(Geneva) A new development in Manchurian propaganda has been discovered in Geneva today, and the police are now paying attention to it. For weeks, reports of propaganda and counter-propaganda, rebuttals and refutations, have been incessant. But today, extremists have taken a hand, and the methods they are using are completely beyond the scope of ordinary diplomacy. Someone threw a bottle containing a protest against British imperialism's aid to Chiang Kai-shek through the window of the office of Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese chief representative. Another bottle, containing the same document, apparently intended for the British consulate, was abandoned in front of a neighboring house. No one saw who threw these bottles, but the police are now investigating. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Meeting of Japanese Residents' Association in Shandong Province Sends Telegram to Briand for Counter-Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Japanese residents held a meeting at the Residents' Association at noon on the 11th and resolved to send a telegram to League of Nations member Briand in the name of the Shandong Residents' Association, saying that I have not fulfilled various outstanding issues in Shandong, and demanding participation rights in municipal administration, making various counter-propaganda, and telegraphing Arawata to prepare a proposal. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Japanese Shandong Residents' Association today telegraphed Arawata, requesting that the following be submitted to the League of Nations: 1. China has not yet fulfilled the Sino-Japanese agreement on resolving the Shandong issue in 1922. 2. The right of Japanese people to participate in Qingdao's municipal administration, stipulated in the treaty, has also not been realized. 3. It is regrettable that the common interests of China and Japan cannot be realized. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>All-Manchuria Japanese Congress Meeting Advanced in Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The All-Manchuria Japanese Congress was brought forward to the 7th in Shenyang. It was resolved: (1) to request the authorities to increase troops to absolutely maintain security; (2) to study the matter of economic turnaround; (3) to earnestly request the resolution of various outstanding Sino-Japanese issues; (4) in this situation, to request relief for the poor. Since the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, the business of Japanese nationals has plummeted, and many do not want the military to persist in this way for long. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Various Groups in Harbin Send Personnel to Heilongjiang to Comfort Troops</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Groups in Harbin are enthusiastically taking money to Heilongjiang to comfort the troops. Seven groups have already sent personnel to the front to deliver supplies. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Purpose of Japanese Aiding Bandits</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain foreigner talked about the Japanese side's purpose in luring bandits: (1) to use bandits to disturb Chinese troops, hoping to drive out the Chinese troops and administrative agencies east of Yuguan, in order to achieve their attempt to support Manchurian independence; (2) to lead bandits to Shenyang to plunder, in order to cover up the Japanese army's plundering in Shenyang and avoid liability for compensation. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Convenes Meeting of Residents</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Embassy convened a meeting of residents last night, which did not end until after 10 o'clock. The content of the meeting was very secret and could not be found out. Japanese residents in Qinhuangdao were ordered to withdraw on the 10th, and most have already returned to their country by ship. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Continue to Arrive in Hankou; Japanese Residents in Qinhuangdao Ordered to Withdraw</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese warship "Yanagi" arrived in Hankou on the 11th. The "Seso", "Dotrito", and "Chirigen" warships will arrive in Hankou within five days. It is reported that Japanese naval commander Shiozawa has informed Japanese residents that if Japanese goods are inspected, they should be taken back by force. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Police Chief of Staff Ye Peng admonished officers and soldiers at a security conference: 1. Protect Japanese residents and their businesses. If an accident occurs, the responsible officials will be severely punished. 2. Strictly arrest hooligans and local ruffians who are instigated to make trouble, and those who are caught will be executed on the spot. 3. Police stations along the Japanese border and those adjacent to the Japanese border should deploy multiple layers of guard posts on Chinese streets 50 or 100 meters away from the Japanese border to prevent any incidents. Finally, he declared that all security officers and soldiers should use their bones as city walls and their blood as moats, and defend our territory with legitimate means and prevent any violent aggression.

<h3>Chiang Holds a Banquet to Entertain Representatives from Northeast Petition; Petition Delegation Petitions the Central Party Headquarters; Zhang Ji and Wu Tiecheng Answer Everything</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang met with the Northeast people's petition delegation at the military academy at 4 pm on the 11th. First, representatives Feng Yong and others stated that the country is facing a national crisis, and they unanimously hoped for domestic peace and unity to unite against foreign aggression. Chiang expressed full acceptance and gave them words of encouragement. Chiang hosted a banquet at the Lichi Society tonight at 8 pm, inviting a total of 70 representatives. Chiang gave a speech, expressing his welcome, and the banquet ended at 10 pm. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A delegation of more than 600 people from the Northeast People's National Salvation Petition, led by Feng Yong, petitioned the Central Party Headquarters at noon on the 11th. 1. Announce the process of the Shanghai Peace Conference. 2. Explain the meaning of the separate Fourth National Congresses. 3. Complete unification immediately. 4. Recover the lost territories in the Northeast by a set date. 5. If the violent Japanese continue to invade various places, they should be stopped by force. 6. Prepare to declare war on Japan. 7. Offer rewards for the arrest of pro-Japanese traitors Yuan Jinkai, Xi Qia, Zhang Haipeng, etc. 8. How should the officials responsible for the lost territories be punished? Central Committee members Zhang Ji and Wu Tiecheng met with the representatives. Zhang Ji first gave a speech, saying that Japan's invasion of our eastern provinces this time is aimed at destroying our China, so the fall of the Northeast is the fall of China. The Central Government has made a great determination and vowed to recover the lost territories in the Northeast. Currently, all countries are dissatisfied with Japan's atrocities and will be able to uphold justice and impose sanctions. The people of the Northeast have a glorious history of the past several thousand years, and you are the excellent youths of the Northeast, who can lead the people of the Northeast to unite and fight together under the leadership of the Central Government to recover the lost territories and save China. Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, saying that the Central Government is now treating the Northeast issue as the biggest issue at present, with the greatest determination and the greatest sacrifice, vowing to unite and recover the eastern provinces. Zhang and Wu gave many speeches, and the representatives asked for a report on the Shanghai consultation process, which Wu also answered, saying that it has now been successfully concluded. The representatives were all satisfied. At 3 pm, the entire group went to the Military Officer School to petition Chiang, who personally met with them and gave a speech, saying that the government sincerely accepts the points requested by the people of the Northeast. Regarding the Northeast students who have no schools to return to, I have already talked to Principal Feng about finding ways to enable them to study and fulfill their ambitions and responsibilities. The government is also finding ways to provide relief to the displaced people of the Northeast. After Chiang finished speaking, Gao Jianguo, a representative of the delegation, asked the government about its diplomatic policy towards Japan. Chiang gave a satisfactory answer. It was not until 5:30 pm that they returned to Jinling University in formation.

<h3>Peking University Students Petition Zhang Xueliang</h3>

<h3>Zhou Yawei's Opinion on Conscription</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Yawei told reporters yesterday that with the violent Japanese invasion and the national crisis becoming increasingly urgent, the government, in addition to striving for unity to jointly resist foreign aggression, should pay more attention to the military training of the people, so as to cultivate a sound physique as a preliminary step in implementing conscription. Zhou said that it is not easy to implement a conscription system in China, which has a vast territory and a large population, and it cannot be proportionally compared with other countries. Countries such as Japan, France, and Italy are implementing conscription systems because they have been implemented for a long time, and their territories are narrow and their populations are small, so they do not feel any difficulties. China is different due to its national conditions, and it should be discussed separately. Even the current conscription system in the country, the soldiers recruited are all children of poor families, relying on monthly salaries to support their families. If a conscription system is implemented, the soldiers will all be obligatory in nature. If a family has several members relying on them for a living, and they are conscripted into the army, the whole family will have no means of living. According to the actual total number of soldiers currently recruited, there are about two million in the country. If the country is unified, with this number of soldiers, plus appropriate training and cultivation, it is sufficient to defend the country. This is my humble opinion, but the government has already made a decision on conscription. After all parties have considered it thoroughly, if it is implemented and is indeed beneficial to the country, then it should be implemented sooner or later. (Special telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3>Central Government Issues Circular Telegram to Achieve Unity</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee's Provisional Plenary Session passed and issued a circular telegram on the 11th to achieve unity. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Our party adheres to the late Premier's teachings and is committed to the National Revolution, aiming to advocate that the Chinese people practice the Three Principles of the People and place China in a realm of freedom and equality. In terms of revolutionary responsibility, all comrades should prioritize sacrifice and struggle for the sake of the country. In terms of revolutionary objectives, the party's interests should prioritize the nation's welfare. This year, banditry has not been quelled, and major disasters have followed one after another, causing death and displacement, and the people cannot bear it. Unprecedented foreign insults are taking advantage of the situation to achieve their goals. The country's affairs are in dire straits, like a pile of eggs. For several years, the Central Government has embodied the late Premier's teachings of love and sincerity towards the party, and has waited patiently for the comrades to realize the situation. Lately, it has become increasingly clear that national difficulties cannot be relieved without unity, and unity cannot be achieved without compromise. If the party and the country cease to exist, what is the point of disagreements? After repeated consultations, there is consensus. All party comrades are willing to understand and forgive each other, to eliminate the pain of disintegration, and to end the difficult situation of the past with the Fourth National Congress, establishing a foundation for the party's unity. We deeply believe that the late Premier's great spirit will illuminate, and with the guarantee of more than forty years of revolutionary history, all our party comrades will be able to sincerely consider the nation's difficulties, examine the revolutionary environment, follow the late Premier's teachings, and abide by the party's constitution, to fulfill the public's will and seek unified solidarity. From now on, with one heart and one mind, we will be loyal and courageous, resisting external aggression and relieving internal suffering. This is how our party will serve the people of the country. We hope that all compatriots and party comrades will understand this intention and work together. We respectfully report this matter for your joint consideration. The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Promulgation of the Organizational Outline of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters; Government Order Specially Appoints Chen Mingshu as Commander-in-Chief; Deployment of Defenses in the Two Regions is Under Detailed Planning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 11th announcing the organizational outline of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief Headquarters. All previous titles of Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander should be abolished immediately. This order also specially appointed Chen Mingshu as the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief. This order also ordered the promulgation of the organizational outline of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief Headquarters. The organizational outline is as follows: (1) To maintain security in the capital and the area between Shanghai and Songhu, a Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief is specially established, to be specially appointed by the National Government. (2) The organization of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief Headquarters will be determined separately. (3) Within the area under his jurisdiction, if the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief encounters military or disaster-related events, he should immediately direct the subordinate units or consult with nearby garrison troops in the area to deal with the situation as appropriate. In urgent situations, he may petition the National Government to allow the use of martial law and immediately implement martial law. (4) When martial law is in effect, the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Commander-in-Chief shall exercise his powers in accordance with the provisions of the martial law regulations. However, if martial law is not in effect, but he believes that the local situation requires the implementation of certain provisions of the martial law regulations, he may petition the National Government for approval to implement them.

Although the organizational outline of the General Headquarters has been promulgated, the responsibility for garrisoning and guarding Beijing and Shanghai is extremely important, and the allocation of troops stationed along the railway lines requires particularly careful planning in order to be properly implemented. Therefore, yesterday and today, Chen Mingshu specially invited Cai Tingkai, Mao Weishou, Yang Jianping, Chen Peikun, Ouyang Ju, and others to his residence to discuss everything. Once all the plans have been decided, they will be submitted to Jiang for approval before implementation.

<h3>Japanese Incite Tianjin Incident</h3>
<p>▲Doihara Secretly Came to Tianjin to Collude</p>
<p>▲Thugs All Departed from the Japanese Concession</p>
<p>▲Arms and Ammunition Also Supplied by Japanese Barracks</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that since occupying Liaoning and Jilin, the Japanese army has sought to create a new situation in North China, eradicating Zhang Xueliang's power to achieve their goal of dominating the three northeastern provinces. This news has long been an open secret. Indeed, on the 3rd of this month, Doihara, accompanied by Jin Liang, arrived in Tianjin. Less than five days later, the Tianjin Incident occurred. Upon learning of this, the reporter took a train to Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 9th to conduct an on-the-ground investigation and returned to Beiping at 12:00 AM that night. The findings of the investigation are reported as follows:</p>
<p>After Doihara and Jin Liang arrived in Tianjin, Jin Liang's sole mission was to persuade Puyi to return to Shenyang and establish his so-called Ming Guang Empire. Doihara, in addition to jointly inducing and threatening Puyi with Jin Liang, had another major task: to unite pro-Japanese factions and seek to create a new situation in North China. Jin Liang's whereabouts were secretive. He lived at No. 93 Xinhua Li Li in the French Concession. [Tianjin City Area Map]</p>
<p>He also established a secret agency at the Beiyang Hotel in the Japanese Concession. He visited Puyi several times, repeatedly requesting him to return to Shenyang to restore the dynasty, presenting his so-called Emperor's Edict, stating that if he was willing to go out of the pass and organize the Ming Guang Empire, the Japanese Emperor would definitely provide full protection. Although some of his entourage echoed this, Puyi's father, Zaifeng, and the former officials Chen Baochen and Zheng Xiaoxu all firmly opposed it. Therefore, this matter has not been realized. As for Doihara, after arriving in Tianjin, he frequently associated with certain pro-Japanese leaders. After repeated discussions, it was decided that Zhang Bi and Li Jichun would come forward to establish a secret agency on Akiyama Street in the Japanese Concession, recruiting ruffians and secretly plotting an uprising. Zhang came from a background as a ruffian, and was previously the police commissioner during Feng Yuxiang's era, with many former subordinates. Li, on the other hand, was a Muslim with many desperate men under his command. At 8:00 PM on the 8th, everything was planned at the Akiyama Street agency, with great activity. The disaster struck at 11:45 PM.</p>
<p>The plainclothes teams recruited by Zhang Bi, Li Jichun, etc., numbered over 2,000, divided into groups of 30, each group with two Japanese soldiers directing them. Each person was paid four yuan per day, and the group leader was paid ten yuan. The Public Security Bureau's detectives had long detected these recruited plainclothes teams. Therefore, the authorities were fully aware of their every move. Wang Shu-chang, Chairman of Hebei Province, notified the consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin on the 6th, stating that according to reports, there were reactionary elements secretly plotting to disrupt the security of Tianjin, and requesting that the consuls of various countries pay attention. At the same time, he notified the Japanese consul, informing him that there were reactionary elements hiding in the Japanese Concession, secretly plotting to disrupt security, and requesting that the undesirable elements in the Concession be strictly dealt with. After receiving the notifications, the consuls all said that they feared it was a rumor and not worth believing. By the 8th, the rumors became more intense. At 5:00 PM, Yao Dongfan of the 15th Brigade of the Northeast Army, acting on emergency orders, arrived from Junliangcheng and deployed sentries outside the XinZhan Railway Station to inspect pedestrians. They then advanced to the station and later guarded Dajing Road. The merchants and people of Tianjin all thought that some important person was coming to Tianjin, so the military and police were on high alert. At 6:00 PM, the Hebei police also added double posts, all the military police were dispatched, and the security team's bicycle teams continued to depart. All entertainment venues in the city, such as cinemas, theaters, acrobatics halls, and miscellaneous places, were ordered to stop night operations. At about 7:00 PM, martial law was simultaneously announced on various roads in BeidaGuan, Nankai, Hedong, and the walled city. At 9:00 PM, all streetcars were ordered to enter the depot. Police informed merchants and residents to close their doors and sleep soundly. At this point, the citizens began to realize that an incident had occurred and were greatly alarmed. At the same time, Japanese soldiers also armed themselves and sealed off the intersections on the border between China and Japan, setting up barbed wire, only allowing pedestrians to go out but not to enter. They also informed merchants and residents to close their doors. At about 10:00 PM, more than 300 plainclothes team members in the Zha Kou area of ​​the Japanese Concession were preparing to attack the Public Security Bureau. At the same time, more than 1,000 plainclothes team members arrived at the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple from Penglai Street in the Japanese Concession and received guns and ammunition from the Japanese. They originally intended to attack the Public Security Bureau fiercely from the Zha Kou area, but because the Public Security Bureau was heavily guarded, they changed their plan. The first route passed through the Qiangzi River from Haiguang Temple, entered the southern city, entered the South Gate, exited the East Gate, and attacked the rear of the Public Security Bureau. The second route attacked the front of the Public Security Bureau from Zha Kou. The third route was ambushed in Hebei in advance, attempting to occupy the provincial and municipal governments and the headquarters of the Second Army after the uprising. At 10:55 PM, the first route began to attack the first district and the second precinct. The police at the precinct, because the precinct was close to the Japanese barracks, did not fire back. The second route began to attack from Zha Kou at the same time. The third route had not yet taken action. At 11:30 PM, more than 100 plainclothes team members attacked Dongma Road from the north entrance of Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers behind them set up machine guns and swept across Dongma Road. At the same time, 60 to 70 plainclothes team members attacked the first district and the sixth precinct from Luzhuangzi. The police at the precinct also did not retaliate because the precinct was close to the Japanese Concession. After 12:00 AM, the first route occupied the first district and the second precinct from Haiguang Temple and then continued to attack. The plainclothes team members advanced to the Xinhua Bridge on the Chinese Merchants' Racecourse and were captured alive by the security team, more than a dozen of them. When the first route attacked, there were two Japanese armored vehicles following in front, and two Japanese officers were directing. As for the second route, when the plainclothes team members attacked from Zha Kou to the vicinity of the Second Telephone Bureau, they were captured alive by the security team, more than a dozen of them. Because the area was under fire, there were many stray bullets flying around, and all the glass windows were broken, but fortunately no one was injured. The plainclothes team failed to attack Dongma Road from the north entrance of Asahi Street, and more than a dozen people sneaked into the</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Hucao An alley, intending to attack Dongmenlian from there. Because there were police ambushed there in advance, they were also captured alive. Another group of more than a dozen plainclothes team members retreated to Ximenlian and encountered an armored car of the Public Security Bureau driving by, so they threw a grenade, and the car was slightly damaged. These more than a dozen plainclothes team members were also all captured alive. The captain of the security team, Shang, was injured. At 1:00 AM on the 9th, Wang Shu-chang notified the consuls of various countries by telephone, saying that an unfortunate incident had now occurred. More than 1,000 rioters attacked the Chinese area in several routes. In order to respect the Sino-British Treaty, our country did not retaliate. Please inform the Japanese consul to prevent the rioters from retreating into the Japanese border at dawn, and please expel the rioters from the Japanese Concession. At 3:00 AM, the consuls of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, and Italy held a meeting at the American consulate. The consuls all expressed their deep sympathy to the Chinese authorities for this unfortunate incident. It was decided to notify the Japanese consul to respect the spirit of the Sino-British Treaty and ban undesirable elements from entering the concession. The Chinese authorities believed that with this method, our country could capture more than 2,000 plainclothes team members alive without firing a shot. However, at about 5:00 AM, the Japanese Tianjin Garrison Headquarters suddenly protested to the Second Army Headquarters by telephone, saying that a platoon leader of the Japanese army had been shot and killed by Chinese soldiers while on duty to prevent rioters from invading the Japanese Concession. Now, Chinese police are ordered to retreat 300 meters immediately, otherwise, the Japanese army will take free measures when necessary. Wang asked, if the Chinese police withdrew, who would be responsible for the security within the 300 meters? And what is the reason why they must retreat? The Japanese army headquarters actually replied that after the Chinese police withdraw, the Japanese side can be responsible for maintaining security, and there is no need to explain the reason for the retreat, etc. The arrogance of the tone can be seen from this. Wang sternly refused. Unexpectedly, another phone call came soon, still ordering the Chinese police to retreat and limiting it to before 6 o'clock. Wang, in view of the situation at the time, in order to avoid conflict and clarify responsibility, ordered the security team to temporarily retreat. Who would have thought that when the security team retreated, the plainclothes team would launch a fierce attack, intending to take advantage of this period, under the cover of the Japanese army, to retreat into the Japanese Concession. At 6:30 AM, the second route made no progress in the attack. The Japanese army began to use artillery to bombard the Public Security Bureau. From 6:30 AM to 7:00 AM, 14 artillery shells were fired. After 7:00 AM, there were still sporadic shots. One of the shells destroyed the office building of the Second Telephone Bureau and killed two coachmen on the road. The rest fell into the Dongluo Bridge River. The sound of artillery gradually subsided until 7:30 AM. It was already dawn. Wang Shu-chang then questioned the Japanese consul again, asking why he bombarded with artillery. Unexpectedly, the Japanese consul did not reply at first. It took half an hour before he shirked responsibility, saying that it was not fired by the Japanese army. However, at that time, there were many Italian sailors on the opposite bank of Zha Kou. Seeing that the artillery fire came from the Japanese barracks, they were all willing to be witnesses to prove that the artillery was fired by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>When the incident occurred, all the Japanese troops in the Japanese Concession were dispatched, firing guns arbitrarily in the Concession. The injured in the Concession were all sent to Kyouritsu Hospital. One person died in front of the Great North Hotel, and one person was injured behind the Four-Sided Clock. It is not yet known whether there were any casualties among the citizens in other places. At about 11:00 PM on the 8th, Japanese soldiers along the river in the Japanese Concession fired machine guns and rifles at Special District 2 and prepared several boats along the river, intending to occupy the river as soon as the Chinese police returned fire. However, the Chinese police did not return fire from beginning to end, so the Japanese army disturbed each other all night and had no excuse. Japanese Consul Goto then telegraphed the Chinese authorities, saying, "At 10:00 PM last night, more than 1,000 rioters were found in Balitai, with the potential to enter the Japanese Concession. The Japanese army had no choice but to dispatch urgently and take legitimate defense." At the same time, he used radio to ask the Lushun fleet to send warships to Tianjin as soon as possible to protect overseas Chinese. As for the Japanese Garrison Headquarters, it had transported more than 20 boxes of munitions to the Japanese barracks from Tanggu on the evening of the 7th. On the 8th, it issued two more orders: (1) Order veterans to complete the organization within ten hours; (2) Establish a wartime hospital in the Japanese Flower Garden Auditorium. The intention is clear. As for the French Concession, after the Japanese army sealed off the intersections on the border between China and Japan when the incident occurred, it also sent patrols to guard the border between France and Japan. After the sound of gunfire, the French Concession Board of Directors immediately dispatched armored vehicles to Xikai for alert and sent Annam soldiers to guard the Wanguo Bridge. At 1:30 AM, the middle section of the Wanguo Bridge was moved away. Although the British Concession was slightly less guarded, all patrol officers were on patrol. On that night, due to the sudden incident, the men and women who were entertained in the play areas of the British and French concessions who could not return to the Japanese Concession and various places in the Hebei Special Zone had to open rooms in hotels and hotels for the night. Therefore, there was a shortage of people in large and small hotels, and there were also those who stayed in brothels and dark prostitutes' homes, which was a situation where they were overwhelmed on Shanyin Road. And there were no less than 6,000 rickshaws gathered in the British and French concessions from the Japanese Concession and other places. Both sides of the main streets were crowded with rickshaws, as if there was a rickshaw exhibition.</p>
<p>After the reporter finished the investigation, he went to the Provincial and Municipal Government to visit Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming. He first went to the Municipal Government. According to Zhang Xueming, the mastermind behind the Tianjin riot of the reactionary elements has been clearly told to us by the facts. I don’t need to explain it. However, regarding the security of Tianjin, I am determined to maintain it with all my strength. There are now more than 1,800 security team members in Tianjin who have received more than ten years of military education. I believe that if there are no Japanese secretly plotting among the plainclothes team members, the security team will have the ability to eliminate them. When the riot started last night, more than 3,000 troops were ordered to open outside the city within three hours, but because they respected the Sino-British Treaty, they did not order them to open into the city. They will never order the troops to open into the city to maintain security unless it is absolutely necessary. After meeting Wang Shuchang, Wang said that three days before the incident, I notified the consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin of the unstable news I had obtained. When the incident occurred, I also notified the consuls. Today, the Tianjin Municipal Government has a protest letter to the Japanese consul in Tianjin. I believe that the security of Tianjin is extremely solid. On the Beiping side, after Zhang, the Deputy Commander, received the alarm on the night of the 8th, he ordered Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming to strengthen their defense and handle it carefully. On the morning of the 9th, he sent his adjutant, Ji Yitian, with two machine guns, to Tianjin by special train from Ping and arrived at 9:00 AM. He went to visit Wang Shuchang and conveyed the Deputy Commander's order, ordering Wang to be fully responsible for maintaining the security of Tianjin. The Tianjin authorities announced martial law on the 9th. Here is the original text of the announcement: "To announce the matter, at 10:00 PM on the 8th of this month, a reactionary plainclothes team of about 1,000 people was found in the Zha Kou area, attempting to attack the various sub-bureaus of the city's public security. After reporting to the Chairman, it was decided to implement the announcement of martial law in accordance with the martial law regulations from the 9th of this month. If there are any unruly people who intend to cause disturbance, they will be arrested and dealt with by military law. The people of the city should also live in peace and not disturb them without authorization. This is extremely important. This announcement is made for everyone to know. Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming."

<h3>Japanese Water and Land Precautions in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou correspondence, since the Shenyang incident, the Japanese government has dispatched warships to Hankou in the name of protecting overseas Chinese. Sandbags were piled up on the street corners of the Japanese concession, and electric nets were laid, as if facing a great enemy. The situation is extremely serious. According to a report from a certain party, the Japanese government solicited the Japanese warships in front of the Japanese Navy Wharf to moor in the heart of the Japanese Concession River (above) Japanese warship Hirado</p>

<p>As a result of the opinions of the consuls stationed in China, it was decided to cause trouble in Shanghai, Hankou, and Xiamen to expand the situation and fulfill their ambition to invade the Northeast and then invade the Yangtze River. At present, there are as many as seven Japanese warships gathered in Hankou, and three more ships, such as Antaku, continue to come. Ronin and yellow volunteer teams are provoking everywhere, proving that a certain party's report is not speculation. The situation of the Japanese army's land and water precautions in Hankou is published at the end, and I hope that our compatriots will pay attention. (9th)</p>
<h3>Shandong after the Tianjin Incident</h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence, the sudden outbreak of the Tianjin Incident, the Jinan press and business circles received a report from Tianjin this morning (9th), and people's hearts were shaken, but order is still safe. As for the officialdom, by the afternoon, no official telegrams from the Pingjin area had been received. The authorities believe that security issues should be maintained urgently. In addition to ordering the military and police to be well prepared in Jinan, coastal ports such as Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, and Weihai are particularly important. They have telegraphed the stationed officers in each port to inquire about the situation. I have not received a reply yet. The Japanese Consul-General in Jinan, Nishida Kouichi, and the military officer stationed in Jinan, visited Han Fuju at the provincial government today to discuss the protection of Japanese overseas Chinese and the seizure of a batch of Japanese cotton yarn that was transported from Jinan to Zaoyuan Temple in Zhangqiu by the local anti-Japanese association. Han promised to take action. It is reported that the Provincial Public Security Bureau has ordered 60 armed police officers to be transported to Zaoyuan Temple in Zhangqiu by a motor vehicle and two factory cars on the Jiaoji Road tonight to deal with the matter according to the situation.

The first, second, and third districts have been reviewed separately in the playgrounds of Fudan University, Jinda University, and Zhonggong University, respectively, with good results. Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, the combined review of the third group in the fourth district was held at the Ximen Public Stadium. It was originally scheduled for fourteen schools to be reviewed. Except for Jiaotong University, Shanghai National Medical College, Shanghai Journalism College, Chinese Medical College, National Conservatory of Music, Datong University, and other schools that did not participate, the remaining schools braved the rain to assemble and await review, fully demonstrating the spirit that the youth volunteer army should possess. The review results were very satisfactory. The details are provided below by a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency:</p>
<p>▲ The inspected armies included 300 youth volunteers from the Sino-French Institute of Technology, 300+ from the School of Law and Politics, 30 female ambulance members, 100 from the Sino-French Pharmaceutical College, 10 female ambulance members, 400 from Aurora University, 400 from the Shanghai Art School, 40+ female ambulance members, 200 from Xinhua Art College, 50 female ambulance members, 200+ from Tongde Medical College, 100+ female ambulance members, 50+ from the East Asia Physical Education College, 20 male ambulance members with well-prepared tents and other rescue equipment, 200 from the Liangjiang Women's Volunteer Army, 100 female ambulance members, and over 10 other schools, totaling over 2,000 people. Except for the Tongde Medical College female ambulance members wearing white uniforms, the rest wore blue uniforms.</p>
<p>▲ Attendees for review: (1) Presidium: Wen Guangyi from the Military Department of the Student Union, Chen Yuejiang from the Sino-French Institute of Technology, Wang Yang from Aurora University; (2) Review Officers: Xiong Xuanwu, Zhong Dao, Qiu Jianmin, Chen Yinhua and others; (3) Representatives from the Sino-French Institute of Technology: Lin Zuhuan, Gu Lihua from Liangjiang; (4) Representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters: Yu Zhongbiao; (5) Commander-in-Chief: Cui Nanchang from the Sino-French Institute of Technology; (6) Masters of Ceremonies: Representatives from the Shanghai Art School, Recorder Li Zhiquan, Zhang Zhongbao.</p>

<p>▲ Circumstances of the Review: Despite the autumn wind and heavy rain and muddy ground, the troops from various schools demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness and waited for the review, which was truly commendable. The review began with a military parade. Due to the overly muddy ground, the originally planned divisional parade could not be held. Instead, each school took turns performing. The Sino-French Institute of Technology performed platoon drills. The whole army was orderly and spirited, and the various movements were very proficient. The Liangjiang Volunteer Army performed gun drills, and the ambulance team performed battlefield rescue, casualty carrying and various movements, which were also very agile. In the heavy rain and slippery ground, the spirit of the female compatriots to save the country was especially evident. Then a platoon from Aurora University performed changing formations, with commendable results.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Yang reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that all students should embrace the spirit of sacrifice, fight for national salvation, create everything with iron blood, and overthrow Japanese imperialism. Without military preparation, peace can never be realized. Therefore, armed national salvation cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>▲ Chen Yuejiang reported on the preparations, stating that today was originally scheduled for the review of the second group in the fourth district. During the preparations, it was felt that the number of people in the separate reviews of the first and second groups in this district was too small. Therefore, it was decided through preparatory meetings to combine the two groups for a joint review today. Fifteen schools were supposed to attend today, but only ten schools with more than 2,000 people actually arrived due to rain or other reasons. However, the spirit and results were very good, and we are very satisfied with this.</p>
<p>▲ Wen Guangyi reported that today is a symbol of our hot blood and rain mixing together. In the future, I hope to have the opportunity to mix our blood and rain together to overthrow Japanese imperialism, and so on.</p>
<p>▲ Review Officer Wu Zhongdao instructed that we who are now soldiers should have the following conditions: (1) solemnity, (2) speed, (3) silence, (4) orderliness.</p>
<p>▲ Wu Baojin, the representative of the Student Union Military Training Department, said that in this period of wind and rain, armed students are able to participate without fear or timidity. This is the spirit of youth. In today's meeting place, the inferior roots of the Chinese nation have been washed clean. The significance of the review: (1) to show the spirit of the people, (2) to hope that the authorities do not rely on the League of Nations. It is hoped that the armed students of China will hold a general review of the youth volunteer army of all universities in Shanghai in the near future in preparation for overthrowing Japanese imperialism. Students in Shanghai should stand on the front line to fight.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Zhongbiao, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, read out the instructions: (1) have the determination to sacrifice, (2) avenge the country, (3) continue to maintain our spirit today. Finally, after each team shouted slogans, they separately formed up and returned to school with great spirits, showing no fear of the rain and wind.</p>

<h3>Memories of Splendor from the Beam</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>▲ Weng Shouqi's Resourcefulness in Assisting with Military Affairs</p>
<p>Weng Shouqi of Wujiang, styled Yinshi, achieved early success in the imperial examinations and excelled in both calligraphy and painting. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, he abandoned his writing brush to join the military, serving under Wu Dacheng as a law enforcement officer and confidential secretary. The troops were stationed in Jinzhou. At that time, Wu's deputy was Song Qing, the Sichuan Provincial Commander-in-Chief, who had previously served under Feng Zicai. Song achieved remarkable military success during the Sino-French War at Liangshan, earning widespread admiration. Wu led over fifty battalions, while Song commanded twenty as his deputy. The Japanese knew of Song's skill in battle and greatly feared him. They frequently used disguised spies to infiltrate Wu's camp and gather military intelligence. One evening, under a faint crescent moon, Weng was on official business, leading over ten cavalrymen, galloping swiftly with muffled hooves. Passing a certain temple, he glimpsed slight movement in the fields. Upon closer inspection, he saw a pack of dogs running and chasing, their behavior particularly strange. He instructed his men to fire upon them. The "dogs" stood up and fled. Weng ordered his men to surround and capture them, apprehending four Japanese individuals, all clad in black and wearing face masks, disguised as dogs. They were taken back to the main camp and rigorously interrogated, revealing their secret mission, and were all executed according to the law. These Japanese spies had been entrusted with a critical task: to bury landmines in the fields to harm our troops. Had they not been discovered by Weng, the soldiers of the fifty battalions would have been reduced to ashes. At the time, people admired Weng's resourcefulness and his ability to eliminate these Japanese spies.</p>

<h3>Don't Underestimate Apprentices</h3>
<p>James Watt, who invented the steam engine 162 years ago, was once an apprentice. Michael Faraday, who invented the dynamo 100 years ago, was also once an apprentice. Apprentices are at the forefront of knowledge, leading the Industrial Revolution and the age of electrification.</p>
<p>China's hopes have always been placed on students. Initially, everyone's attention was focused on students studying abroad. When the students studying abroad lost their faith, everyone shifted their attention to university students. When the university students lost their faith, everyone shifted their attention to middle school students, and now it is gradually shifting to elementary school students. If teachers and students do not have fundamental awareness, then middle school students and elementary school students will also be disappointing.</p>
<p>Civilization is created by humans using their minds and hands. Those who can only use their minds but not their hands, or only their hands but not their minds, are hopeless, let alone those who love to talk emptily. If they are willing to use their hands and think with their brains, then there is hope for students studying abroad and university students. Otherwise, if they fold their hands in their sleeves and read books to death, die reading books, and die from reading books, then even middle school students and elementary school students will one day disappoint us. My suggestion for young people in science is:</p>
<p>1. Those who have been students should work as apprentices for a few years;</p>
<p>2. Those who have been apprentices should study as students for a few years.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Patriotic Man's Embroidered Needle Affair</h3>
<p>— Lu Shifang</p>
<p>Previously, I saw in the newspaper that the Japanese in our Eastern Provinces recruited the bandit leader nicknamed Little White Dragon, providing him with 4,000 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition to disrupt local security, intending to use it as a pretext for prolonged occupation of Liaoning and Jilin. Little White Dragon pretended to be willing to follow orders, but after obtaining the guns and ammunition, he led his men directly to attack the Japanese, inflicting heavy casualties on them. Whether this account is a true record or a deliberately sensationalized story by the writer, a momentary gratification akin to gorging oneself at a butcher's shop, is unknown. However, people in the bandit world are mostly men of passion who still have a national consciousness and ethnic thoughts, unlike the meat-eaters who only know personal gain and do not hesitate to commit treasonous acts. This is what we can deeply believe without a doubt. As for the Japanese's cunning schemes, thinking of using bandits to undermine the security of the Northeast, this is even more within expectation, and this matter should be credible. When compared to them, the likes of Xi Zhi and Zhang Haipeng should be ashamed to death. I believe this incident is similar to the Ming Dynasty pirate Embroidered Needle's plan to defeat the Qing army, and I am following this up with an account of the Embroidered Needle affair, to shame those who willingly follow in the footsteps of Zhang Bangchang and Li Wanyong.</p>
<p>Embroidered Needle was none other than Wang Xing, a former subordinate of the patriotic hero Zheng Zhilong. He was born a pirate, of short stature, but resourceful and cunning. People at the time called him Embroidered Needle. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, he gathered over a thousand men and defended Wen Village Fortress in Guangdong. A member of the Ming imperial family sought refuge in the fortress. Xing supported him as their leader, recruiting heroes from all directions. Officials and gentry who were unwilling to shave their heads all flocked to him. After the Qing army conquered Guangdong, they sent a proclamation to Wen Village Fortress, urging them to surrender. Xing replied in writing, saying, "We stubborn people are doing nothing more than trying to preserve China in one corner and maintain propriety and righteousness for centuries. We are not merely reluctant to part with these few hairs on our heads. As for the small piece of land by the sea, it was originally our property, and the previous dynasty always disregarded it. Why bother mentioning the new dynasty? If you insist on seizing it, then we stubborn people will die rather than surrender." The Qing army attacked with sharp forces. Xing knew he could not win and could not defend by force. He pretended to negotiate for peace, presenting a memorial requesting surrender. When the Qing army arrived, Xing launched a surprise attack, killing countless enemies. Later, the Qing troops came in full force to attack. Wen Village Fortress ran out of food. Xing, with a hoarse voice and exhausted strength, had no way out. He took poison and committed suicide. Before his death, he told his subordinates, "Everything I have done is to shame the Chinese subjects who have betrayed their country and served the barbarians." Alas, how heroic! Can he not be called a patriotic man?</p>
<h3>A Letter from the Magistrate of Liaoyang County Fawning on the Japanese</h3>
<p>— Written by Ms. Xiangzhu from Yingkou</p>
<p>This time, the brutal Japanese invaded and occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Everyone with blood and breath is filled with anger. The Japanese government sent the military attaché Major General Kawagishi to Liaoning and Jilin to appease the Japanese army who massacred our compatriots. When he arrived at Liaoyang County, the county magistrate, Yang Xianqing, was servile and obsequious, doing his best to ingratiate himself. However, being under the oppressive power of the brutal Japanese, it is still forgivable. Looking at the letter he sent to Kawagishi, praising his virtues and extolling his merits, one knows that his heart is dead and his blood is cold. The letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted. The Liaoyang region has enjoyed safety and happiness thanks to the ample assistance of the officers and soldiers of your esteemed country and your esteemed military.

<h3>Soviet Russia's Film Project</h3>
<p>— Yiwesheng</p>
<p>Soviet Russia recently had an educational slogan, saying, "All school teachers must be able to show movies."</p>
<p>Recently, a Moscow news reporter visited Comrade Senmyaski, director of the largest film trust in Soviet Russia. He recorded his conversation as follows:</p>
<p>"By the end of 1932, we will need 75,000 film operators. Where will these 75,000 film operators come from? This year, we have already trained 12,000 people in our technical schools. Next year, we can train 35,000 more. However, this number is still not enough. Therefore, this autumn, all teacher training classes have added a film showing subject. We plan to train 30,000 rural teachers (women) to make film showing their side business. The rural teachers of today are already too busy. Adding the time occupied by personal social activities, how can they have time for this? Will we increase their labor burden by adding this new job? No, this agency will allow them to hire three to four female farmers as assistants. They can train their assistants to help with schoolwork or show movies. This will be handled according to how much time this agency takes away from their schoolwork. On the one hand, it can also prepare a new job for these female farmers in the winter."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of sound film, Senmyaski said:</p>
<p>"We are truly extremely behind in this. Today, there are only three sound film theaters in the entire Soviet Union. By the end of this year, it will increase to 100, and next year it will increase to 550. This speed of increase raises many technical problems. All existing machinery is extremely expensive and not perfect. Therefore, we must quickly complete a cheaper plan, which is to add sound attachments to ordinary projectors. This is cheap and easy. We are indeed behind in sound films, but at the same time, we also have inventions that are certainly very important for this technology. For example, one film can be produced in one place, while sound can be recorded at a radio station extremely far away in another place. Secondly, there are narrow and non-combustible films for mobile screenings. Thirdly, there are color films. Twenty color films should be completed next year."</p>
<h3>Today's Poetry Selection</h3>
<p>— Lin Liqin</p>
<p>I recently received the entire collection of Mr. Cao Dunyin of Chongming's Dunlu Poetry and Prose from Mr. Chen Jiequan. Opening the book is beneficial and provides material for study, which is very touching. Mr. Cao is a prominent scholar of Chongming. His morality and writing have long been admired by his fellow villagers. He especially excels at calligraphy, deeply understanding the spirit of Su Shi. His writings are mostly about managing the world and helping the people, and his poems and rhapsodies are mostly about worrying about the times. Now I extract several chapters of his poems from the collection as today's poetry selection.</p>
<p>The Warlord of Huanggu Village Moves the Tripod, the Nine Provinces Fracture. Heroes compete, splattering the blood of the Central Plains. Duke Sun leaps on horseback and rises in Liaodong. His demeanor is dignified, how heroic. A hundred battles at Yuguan, carrying a bow in his quiver. The armies of Hebei yield to the wind. The nine gates of the heroic capital build high banners. Riding a horse, Chang'an's aura is like a rainbow. The cavalry garrisoned in the Southern Suburbs flee west. The arrogant marshals of Heluo shake hands and carry their hands. Hua Yuan suddenly ascends to Zifan's bed. They argue over the punishment of the white horse, pushing for a covenant. The drums and bells of Shaoyang cross the river. Southern Henan and Northern Shanxi are noisy and tumultuous. The vanguard of a hundred thousand collapses at the sight of the wind. Tianjin cannot be defended, and Jizhou opens. The general commands to pull up the camp. On the Shenyang highway, cars fly. Alas, the ground of Peng's demise emits thunder. The smoke of gunpowder fills the sky, scattering flesh and bones. In the past, Zhang Liang ambushed at Bolang. Before Han's revenge was avenged, Qin was almost in danger. Now, the assassination to the death is no longer used. Who doubts who is the enemy? Alas, jackals and wolves fill the land, and tigers and leopards attack. Internal strife and dependence on each other. Contending for cities and land, killing many people. How many heroes have seen the heavens punish them? Do you not hear that Cen Peng and Lai She both died as bandits? Dying for the country is also a heroic ghost. Zhu San calls himself emperor but does not end well. The Southern Dong Shi of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Yuejing Ersan, Guan Chu North Capital. He is on the River for a long time. Domination has been promoted by the King. Save time, don't waste time. Before considering the case, clean and wash. The youth group calculates in. The southern barbarian shows and measures flat.</p>
<p>The towering Mount Yiwu rises ten thousand zhang high. Heroes leap on horseback, their spirit difficult to dispel. The pig of Liaodong is huge, and the Emperor of Heaven is unleashed. Beyond the border, the foals are fat, and autumn is desolate. In the jade tent, talented officials sound iron cavalry. Green forest heroes wear golden sable. Whose military might is strongest in the North and South today? Ashamed, the lamb's head goblet fills the court.</p>
<p>▲ Lament for Jiangnan One By Party Struggle Chaos Like Hemp. The season Han decline has overturned vehicles. Occasional speech is harsher than Qin's laws. Loud words turn against the scholars of Lu. Rivers and mountains stand tall, East and West Emperors. City and field only incite internal and external snakes. Leaving a single line of Jiangnan to live. Please put down your spears and armor and cherish the insects and sand.</p>
<p>The above poems mostly express the feelings of the time, but their land and affairs seem to be related to today's Japanese pirates in the Northeast and the internal peace issue. Therefore, I use Today's Poetry Selection as a heading.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Visits Shanghai Again (14)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country bumpkin thought of a joke; it was also a person from our village, who came to Shanghai for the first time, and someone tricked him and said; "Rickshaws are also divided into three classes; sitting on the footrest is third class, sitting in the middle is second class, and sitting on the hood is first class." Our friend from the village was an honest and frugal person, and he believed it to be true. When he arrived in Shanghai, he really refused to sit in the middle of the rickshaw, but went to sit on the footrest, in order to save a few cents, which made the passers-by laugh.</p>
<p>Originally, the rickshaw can only be sat in the middle, and people cannot sit on the hood and footrest, so the rickshaw only has second class, and there is no first class or third class. It is exactly the opposite of the tram, the tram only has first class and third class, but no second class. Just as he was thinking about this, he couldn't help but exclaim, "Huh! Strange, strange!"</p>
<p>It turned out that sitting on his left, there was a friend who was unfolding a map of the Hankou flood. The flood map was all photographs taken by several charitable disaster relief workers on the spot. A prosperous and lively Hankou city had become a vast expanse of water. What the country bumpkin's eyes fell on was a picture in the flood map, showing a place where the water was slightly shallow, with several rickshaws dragging in the water. The water had submerged the wheels, and people could not sit in the middle, so they sat on the hood. The country bumpkin thought: I just said that rickshaws don't have first class, isn't this clearly sitting in first class?</p>
<p>"Where are you going? Don't pretend to be stupid, you want to buy chestnuts." The chestnut seller had sold all the tickets to the other guests, and stood in front of the country bumpkin to urge him to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>"How much does it cost to go to Meilanfang?"</p>
<p>"I'm asking you to buy a ticket! What Meilanfang?"</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't you even know Meilanfang? Even I, a country bumpkin, knows it, but you people who are always in Shanghai don't know."</p>
<p>"What Meilanfang or not Meilanfang? I'm asking you where you want to buy a ticket to?" At this time, the ticket seller was also confused, what kind of person is this country bumpkin after all?</p>
<p>"Are you going to see Meilanfang's play tonight?" A passenger next to him, seeing that he was not clear with the ticket seller, also wanted to explain for him.</p>
<p>"I don't watch Meilanfang's play, I want to go to Meilanfang's place. I'll buy a ticket, just buy a ticket to a place near Meilanfang, how much it should cost, it's how much it should cost."</p>
<p>The ticket seller still didn't understand after a long time.</p>
<p>"You said a place near Meilanfang! I don't even know where Meilanfang is staying this time he came to Shanghai? He just got on the bus and wanted to sit in second class. Now he wants to sit in Meilanfang's place, you sir, are really an Amulin,..."</p>
<p>"Not bad! Not bad! It's Amulin! I'm just looking for Amulin!" The country bumpkin rushed to say this.</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Rebounds and Rises</h3>
<p>▲Rushing Advance, Sluggish Retreat, Stimulating the Rise of Nian Erliang The gold standard yesterday, the 11th, stopped its decline and began to rise again, but the trading still had rushed advances and sluggish retreats, with sixteen taels traded throughout the day. As a result, it stimulated a rise of twenty-two taels, which is a reversal of more than one hundred taels after a week of continuous decline. This is unpredictable. The reason for the sharp rise is probably due to the great contradictions in the silver market. Public telegrams continued to rise, while private telegrams fell, which stimulated people's emotions. It opened with a rushing advance, and various parties released rumors, intending to raise the large forward price, pretending to receive cash. The exchange bills were tight, and the large gangs resisted the short selling. Soon after, it broke through 620 taels. The market suddenly soared. Unexpectedly, the Dalian Gang and others tended to sell off, and the price fell slightly. The market was lacking in foreign exchange on Wednesday, but the opening was very weak, and it immediately turned up. Although the Dalian Gang had sell-offs, the buying momentum of Zhifengyong and others became more constant. However, the situation was still stable, hovering around 620 taels.</p>
<p>▲The Opening Jumped Out of the 600 Tael Mark The opening rose by 13 taels and 2 qian, to 610 taels. The large strip still rose by half a bant to 4375, and the silver price increased by 1.5 fen. However, the private telegram fell by as much as 2.75 fen, which was unexpected. There were ups and downs of 1-2 taels, from 11 taels to 09 taels. The buying momentum was very strong, and Tong Taichang, Yifeng, Hengxing, Bingxing, Zhifengyong, Hengchangyong, etc. all competed to buy, and the price rose by more than ten taels. The exchange market also showed signs of strength, with the British gold bank initially buying at 11 pence, then at 10 pence 875. The US dollar was initially at 36 yuan, then at 35 yuan 75, and at 9:20 it rose to 24 taels. However, Yuanxingyong and Tong Taichang sold off, and the price immediately fell by 4-5 taels. The British gold quote remained unchanged, and the US dollar was quoted at a small 25, and it had fallen to 18 taels and 5 qian. After 9:30, Hengxing, Yifeng, Yuda, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Bingxing, etc. had very strong buying momentum, and HSBC bought British gold at 10 pence 5625 and also bought US dollars at 35 yuan 625, so the gold price rose by 5-6 taels.</p>
<p>▲The List Price Shrank Repeatedly, and the Market Atmosphere Became More Sharp Around 10:30, HSBC's list price suddenly shrank, with the British gold decreasing by half a pence and the US dollar decreasing by another 75. The market was extremely sharp, reaching 25 taels. Afterwards, the Dalian Gang, Tong Taichang, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and physical hedgers came to sell, with the US dollar bank buying at 35 yuan 6875, and the price fell sharply by 7-8 taels, until 15:15, it was 17 taels. After that, Hengxing's buying trend did not stop, and it pulled up another 4-5 taels, and at noon it was 22 taels. When the market closed at 21 taels and a half, it was suppressed to 18-19 taels. The physical goods came out, and the quoted price was 688 taels, with a deduction of about 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲The After-Market Hovers Around 20 Taels The after-market opened down 6 taels, at 15 taels, because the Dalian Gang rose up to sell, and there was a rumor that the Japanese bandits in the north were brazenly increasing their troops. However, Zhifengyong's buying intention was excited, and in a moment it rose happily to 21 taels. Later, there were ups and downs of 2 taels, and after 2:30, the Dalian Gang and Dadecheng continued to sell, falling back by 3 taels. At 3 o'clock, it was 17 taels and a half. Soon after, Yifeng, Tong Taixing, and others continued to advance without slackening, and rushed out of 20 taels again, with ups and downs of 2-3 taels in between. At 4 o'clock, it was 23 taels, and Fuchang, Bingxing, Maoyong, and retail investors sold, and then shaved off 4 taels, until the market closed at 4:30 at 18 taels and 8 qian, and then suppressed to 18 taels or so, an increase of 22 taels compared to the previous day (according to the listed price). The maximum for the whole day was 25 taels, and the minimum was 09 taels, a difference of 16 taels. The physical goods were 09 taels in the morning market, 20 taels at noon, 16 taels in the afternoon, and 18 taels at the close of the market. The listed price was 688 taels, with a deduction of about 70 taels, and the book price was 22 taels. The pre-market replenishment water was 22 taels, the post-market was 19 taels, and the red strip was added to 9 taels 25.</p>
<p>▲Guang Gang Covers Shorts, Dalian Sells More Trading on the Table, each goes its own way. According to statistics, Hengxing, Shengda, Yuancheng Yong, Fuyu, Hengchang Yong, Taifengcheng, Yuda, Yifeng Yong, Yifeng, Qianchangxiang, and Bingxing all advanced, while Yuantai, Tong Taichang, Yuanheng, Yuanxingyong, and Daxingyong had quite a lot of incoming and outgoing. Shunli, Wanxing, Fengyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Futaiheng, and Yuankangxiang all went out, and Yuanmaoyong had a lot of trading in and out, still selling 1,700 to 800 strips. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Yuanmao, Fuyu, Yifeng, Yuanxingyong, and Qianchangxiang all advanced, while Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, and Hengchangyong all went out. Dadecheng, Tong Taichang, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Yifeng Yong, Senchangyong, Yongfengcheng, Yuhe, and physical hedgers were all very busy. Guang Gang covered shorts for more than 4,000 strips, and the Dalian Gang sold a lot of long positions, a total of more than 5,000 strips, so it advanced more than 1,000 strips. Speculators had some incoming and outgoing, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Very Pretty</h3>

Hong Kong suddenly increased by 875, to 76 taels 375, and the rest did not change. At 10:20, it suddenly changed and reduced by two grades, with the British gold decreasing by half a pence, now at 1 shilling 10 pence, and the US dollar by 75, to 34 yuan 875, and the rest also changed. The internal market was firm from the morning, and it was even tighter later. The gold price rose sharply by more than 20 taels due to the divergence of the silver market and the reported decline in forward contracts in the New York market, breaking through the 620 tael mark. Finally, the British gold decreased by 75 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar also decreased by 1 yuan 25. Chinese merchants had different incoming and outgoing, and the overall trend was to increase purchases and decrease sales. However, there were sales of forward contracts. Fuchang and others mostly hedged. About 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and there were many transactions with banks. HSBC bought long positions, and about 400,000 to 500,000 US dollars were traded. Mobil Oil Company settled some accounts. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was no market activity.</p>

<h3>The Interest Rate Market is Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview Recently, it has been heard from various ports that the silver market in Shanghai is tightening and has not been able to recover for a long time. Therefore, the overdue debts have been continuously shipped to Shanghai in cash. However, the money from the interior is mostly in the form of foreign banknotes, so the current trend is to install foreign banknotes to Shanghai for compensation. Although it is a scattered small number, the accumulation of streams into canals and the compilation into numbers is indeed not small, which may be related to the decline of the market.</p>
<p>▲Interest Rate拆借Prices "Foreign Interest" The early market was 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half. The noon market even entered the 5 fen barrier in Guannei and was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 8 hao and 7 halfs. As a result, it fell by 1 li 8 hao and 7 halfs compared to the early market of the previous day. "Silver拆借" The early and noon markets were the same at 3 qian 3 fen, which was slightly lower by 2 fen than the early market of the previous day. The added water conversion was 2 qian 89 fen. The bank's listed price was 1 qian 3 fen.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Situation Jiangnan small foreign coins, the early and noon markets were the same at 6 qian 5 fen 1 li and a half. The transaction was 2,500 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins, the early market was 6 qian 5 fen, and the noon market was 6 qian 4 fen 9 li 7 hao and a half. The transaction was 115,000 jiao in the early market and 85,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 wen, to 379,500 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Foreign Exchange In and Out "Silver Exchange" On the bank side, the tightening of the silver market resulted in more receipts. Chinese merchants received 1.8 million to 1.9 million in checks, foreign merchants received more than 1.8 million in checks, various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous accounts received 7.8 million to 900,000, special accounts received 2-3 million, warehouse receipts received 1.4 million, and Qianzhuang and Silver Guild Dan received more than 43 million, the head exchange account received more than 3.8 million, all exchange accounts received more than 800,000, and cash received more than 1 million. "Foreign Exchange" Exchange exchange accounts, the early market made 1.03 million, and 75,000 in banknotes. The noon market exchange accounts made 1.13 million, and 60,000 in banknotes. The early market for banknotes outside the market was 95,000, and the noon market was 125,000. The banks traded with each other in the early market for 450,000, and in the noon market for 600,000. Various banks received and paid more than 1.4 million in foreign accounts, and the banknotes in and out were 1.7 million to 800,000. Qianzhuang Yanggongdan received more than 6.5 million, Yanghuatou accounts received more than 1.7 million, interbank loans were more than 1.6 million, and customer sources were more than 500,000. There was no news of stomach removal, and the small qianzhuang traded more than 500,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds Resume Downward Trend</h3>
<p>▲Unified Tax Bonds Drop About One Yuan▲Trend Peaceful, Market Idle</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, in the bond market, only a few varieties such as the Unified Tax 1934 were offered for spot trading. Trading volume remained sparse. The futures market was also quite inactive. As for the trend of the various bonds, it generally remained peaceful. However, due to the depressing nature of the current situation, and the increasingly serious diplomatic situation with Japan, coupled with the increasing tension in the international situation, investors became even more hesitant to buy. Major investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Although sellers did not offer large amounts for sale, the selling pressure was still stronger than the buying, leading to a general decline in bond prices. In the morning sessions, prices of all bonds fell, but the momentum was sluggish, with only slight fluctuations, dropping only about 3 or 4 jiao compared to the previous day. In the afternoon session, with more selling, the decline was steeper, falling another 7 or 8 jiao compared to the morning. As a result, compared to the previous day, bonds like the Unified Tax, 20th Year Customs Bonds, Unified Tax and Salt Tax bonds fell by more than one yuan. The 1930 Customs Bond also fell by a little over eight jiao, while the Reorganization, Disarmament, and Consolidated Sixth Year Customs bonds remained largely unchanged, falling about four jiao compared to the previous day. Furthermore, the spot price of the Unified Tax bond fell by three yuan compared to last week, while the spot price of the 1934 Customs bond uniquely rose by two yuan. Observing the trend of the bond market, it remains as sluggish as before. Its future fate will continue to depend on the development of the diplomatic situation. The total trading volume for the day was 40 yuan in spot transactions, over 3.4 million yuan in morning futures, and over 3.7 million yuan in the afternoon session, totaling 7,155,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market: Downturn Resurges</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the downward trend is intensifying. Due to the many national crises and widespread rumors, combined with extremely tight credit, public sentiment has become uneasy. Furthermore, some manufacturers are hedging their purchases, weakening the market further. Speculators are inclined to sell, making the situation even worse. Actual sales in the market are affected by financial conditions, and demand is lacking due to the turmoil of the times.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Cotton Yarn Futures Plummet</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the foreign cotton yarn futures market, due to the downward trend of American cotton, market sentiment was very loose. In the second and third sessions, news of gold price rebounds caused prices of various months to rise as well, resulting in a flat outcome, with distant months falling by three qian. In the afternoon, near months plummeted by one liang and four or five qian, and distant months fell by six or nine qian. The total trading volume for the day was 31,200 bales. It was found that Tianlong sold 2,250 bales, Rongxing sold 1,400 bales, and Yichang sold 1,400 bales. Buyers included Gongtai (1,100 bales), Jifeng (1,250 bales), Gengfeng (1,200 bales), Xincheng (2,150 bales), and Yichang (1,450 bales). The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>January   1550 Down 13  82,550  April   1555 Down 6  31,000</p>
<p>▲Yarn Sales Very Quiet</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are very quiet. Statistics for the entire day show that various trade associations purchased only 300 bales. Inter-dealer transactions totaled 35 bales, and the market is trending downwards. Among out-of-town dealers, 80 bales were purchased by those from the interior, 15 bales by those from Ningbo, 15 bales by those from the Northern trade, 40 bales by those from Guangdong, 40 bales by those from Shantou, 75 bales by those from Sichuan, and 15 bales by those from Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Weak and Listless</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak. American cotton has turned downwards again. Various factories, recognizing the unfavorable overall trend, are standing aside to observe. Therefore, transactions of foreign cotton are relatively scarce. However, prices are still low. It is said that the Wing On factory has purchased enough American cotton to meet their needs for two or three years. Because of this situation, the position of native cotton is extremely precarious. However, local cotton merchants, seeing that arrivals from various routes are slightly less, are holding tightly to their near-month positions and even thinking of squeezing the shorts, so the market sentiment has been stabilized.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Cotton Falls by Two Qian</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the Hankou cotton market, although American cotton rose and the gold market also rose, market sentiment was flat. In the afternoon, news that the selling price of foreign cotton was still low caused further declines of five fen to one qian and five fen. The total trading volume for the day was 73,200 dan. It was found that Mingde sold 2,400 dan, Yiyu sold 1,100 dan, Yida sold 1,200 dan, Changfeng sold 1,400 dan, Yongchang sold 2,600 dan, and Yifeng sold 2,200 dan. Buyers included Yuda (2,900 dan), Tongxing (2,200 dan), and Yichang (3,500 dan). The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton: Declines Outnumber Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to speculative buying, but later turned weak due to the slump on Wall Street and profit-taking by longs. Futures fell 8 to 14 points, and spot prices fell 15 points. English cotton futures fell 4 to 5 points, while spot prices rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 10 points. Indian cotton strengthened due to rising American cotton and short covering. Plain Gore rose 4 rupees, Omra rose 4.25 rupees, and White Gore Creek rose 5 rupees.

<h3>Grain Market: Rice Market - Lower in the South, Firm in the North</h3>
<p>▲South Head Yesterday, sources from various trade associations were not abundant. Retail sales in the city and countryside were affected by the current situation. The market for thick new japonica rice has temporarily stabilized. The main street in Baige Kiln has slightly picked up. Ningwei is slightly weaker. Imported Dujian is quiet in sales. The market is neither prosperous nor depressed. Aged and damaged goods are scarce, rising by one jiao.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha Yesterday, sources were sporadic, and river accumulations were slightly available. Due to the rain, retail sales in the city were few. Opening prices were only available from Hefeng, Hengxing, Qingshengyi, and Tongxing, with about 1,000 shi of foot rice. West New Sixth Grade rose by one jiao. Imported Dujian is high and tight, followed by sluggishness. Glutinous rice is clearly stable and secretly tight.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice: Spot Prices Up, Futures Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still inquiries about foreign rice spot goods from the main street, and the out-of-town traders also had intentions of buying, but the cargo owners were very firm in their thinking, and the market continued to improve. Yesterday, the selling price of imported Zhongguan Xiaojiao was 10 yuan and 3 jiao and 2 fen, which was nearly one jiao higher than the previous market. After the gold price fell, the production cost was reduced, and the foreign firms were willing to sell, so the market gradually declined. Yesterday, new transactions were made for 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 for December delivery, at a price of 5 taels, 3 qian and 7 fen to 5 taels, 3 qian and a half. Another 100 tons of return cargo for April delivery was priced at 5 taels and 7 qian, all of which were purchased by the main street traders.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Slight Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market fell by 8 to 9 jiao to about 1 yuan due to the quotation of foreign wheat. Rumor has it that the price of foreign wheat fell because the government did not maintain it. Fortunately, the gold price stabilized, and most people's minds were not shaken. From the manufacturers' side, only small factories made slight offers, while large factories remained unchanged. In terms of actual sales, Tianjin's situation has eased, and there has been a slight increase in recent intakes. Therefore, although the overall environment is not very good, the degree of decline is not drastic. As a result, the current month is down 5 li compared to the previous day, December is down 2.5 li, January is down 1 fen, February and March are down 1 fen and 2.5 li, and April is down 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Resume Downward Trend</h3>
<p>▲Foreign Wheat Plummets...Public Sentiment Negative</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed signs of weakening again. The quotation for foreign wheat suddenly plummeted by about one yuan, which seems to be a very noteworthy event amidst the wild drop in the gold market. As a result, people were pessimistic, and buyers felt helpless. At present, the rise and fall depend entirely on foreign quotations and the expansion and contraction of exchange rates, and there is little consideration of actual needs. As a result, the current month is down 2 fen, December is down 2 fen, January, February, and March are down 5 fen each, and April is down 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Prices Settle Slightly After a Decline</h3>
<p>▲Active Trading in Distant-Term Raw Sugar and White Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market reported that the price of Cuban spot sugar was still 1.375 and the price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.32, and the price for March of next year was 1.29. There were no changes compared to the previous telegram. May was 1.34, up 2 points, and September was 1.43, which fell by 1 point instead. The price of Java spot sugar remained unchanged. The trading in the association market was quiet. Moreover, since the following day was the anniversary of the late Prime Minister's birth, all sectors were resting, and no goods were delivered, which made the intake and outlet even quieter. The asking price for Dutch No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar was 10 taels and 02.5 qian, and the buying interest for No. 20 medium sugar and white sugar was very sluggish. However, with the Dutch exchange rate shrinking, the market sentiment turned slightly stable. Taikoo Fine B grade was 11 taels and 7 qian and a half, HX grade was 11 taels and 4 qian and a half, and HM grade was 11 taels and 1 qian, and transactions were also scattered. The market was relatively firm and stable. There was quite active trading in Dutch raw sugar and white sugar for delivery in February and March next year. Yesterday, various foreign firms in the market offered sales at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao to 6 jiao and a half, while Huaxin continued to open 300 tons at a price of 5 yuan and 6 jiao, and the firm's intention to purchase was also weakened. The market mood was calm and lacking in spirit.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Factories' European Telegrams Still Show No Turnaround in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai's foreign trading houses became increasingly quiet. It was found that the overseas white silk factories did not see a turnaround in the European telegram due to the increase in foreign exchange. European and American hoarders did not dare to risk hoarding. The market atmosphere was sluggish. Yesterday, only Kaili purchased 5 bales of Huang silk, Samsung purchased 6 bales of Huang silk, and Zhonghe purchased 10 bales of Bai Gan silk. The prices were generally flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Autumn Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai Exceed 100 Loads</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the slump in sales of factory silk to Europe, the silk factories in Wuxi have been losing money and unable to support themselves. They have announced their closure one after another. The number of silk factories in operation in the city is less than 40%. The consumption of dry cocoons has been greatly reduced, and almost no one is asking about them. Generally, surplus cocoon traders will transport their stored cocoons to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday, another 106 dan of Wuxi autumn cocoons were transported to Shanghai and are currently stored in the railway bureau's warehouse.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Green Tea: European Sales Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign tea market, Huzhou Pingshui green tea was slightly more active in English sales. Among them, for the pearl tea category, Tongfu Foreign Firm purchased over a thousand boxes alone, with a sales price of 80 to 90 taels, which was not much different from before. English traders Jinlong and Fushi and other firms have a need for needle eyebrows, Xiu eyebrows and other grades, but there is a shortage of inventory, and transactions are rare. However, the market for top and middle grade Zhen Mei Gong Xi green tea remains sluggish.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Sheets Resume Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Since the Tianjin traders' rush purchase of black iron sheets, the inventory has been weak, so the market price has risen steadily. The price per dan can reach as high as 11 taels and 7 qian and a half. In recent days, traders from Qingdao, Niuzhuang and other places have also started to purchase, so the market wind is good again, and the transaction is hot again. The market is quoting a price of 12 taels. It is reported that five to six hundred bundles have been sold in the past two days, but the bottom goods are therefore less and less, and the public sentiment is good. There is hope that the future standard will continue to improve.</p>
<h3>200 More Tons of Pig Lead Arrive</h3>
<p>Pig lead transactions are very quiet because the export traders do not purchase. The market is quite secretly weakened because the exit is not wide. The current estimated price is 14 taels and 5 qian, which is 2 qian and a half lower than before. However, it was found that 200 tons arrived at the Gonghexing Warehouse yesterday, and it is feared that the market will fall again.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Military, Police, and Local Defense Corps Yesterday - Measures to Maintain Public Order</h3>
<p>▲Joint Military-Police-Corps Office to Be Established in Zhabei▲Mayor Zhang Expresses Responsibility for Protecting Public Order</p>
<p>The Japanese have been plotting and scheming in various commercial ports in China, such as Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, using despicable means to create disturbances and destruction, in order to deceive various countries and achieve their cunning plan of not withdrawing troops. Since receiving the alert about the Tianjin Incident, the military and police in this city have received intelligence from various sources that more than 200 Japanese ruffians have colluded with local criminals in this city, hoping to instigate a major riot to disrupt public order in this city. Therefore, in order to prevent such incidents from occurring, the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Government Garrison Headquarters sent competent officials to conduct strict investigations. At the same time, a joint meeting of the military, police, and local defense corps was held at the municipal government at 2 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Garrison Headquarters, the Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team, and the Local Defense Corps attended the meeting. Mayor Zhang Qun also personally attended the meeting. The discussion lasted a long time, and it was not until after 5 p.m. that the meeting ended. After the meeting, according to Mayor Zhang's report, the results of the discussion can be summarized as follows: The city's public order prevention measures are very thorough, and there are specific plans. Although Japanese ruffians have repeatedly provoked trouble, they have been stopped immediately. However, it is said that there are Japanese ruffians colluding with criminals to instigate a riot, so in order to prevent such incidents from occurring, a more detailed plan was discussed at today's joint meeting of the military, police, and local defense corps. The discussion resulted in a very detailed plan. In order to facilitate the exchange of information, mutual communication, and effective prevention among the three parties - the military, police, and local defense corps - it was decided to establish a joint military-police-corps office of Shanghai Municipality in Zhabei, so as to make prevention of public order and protection of citizens more convenient and thorough.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang also stated responsibly that he is always responsible for maintaining public order and citizen safety in the city. In addition to striving for thoroughness in prevention, he also dares to declare to the citizens that public order in the city can be peaceful and safe and that no accidents will occur.</p>
<h3>Increased Patrols in the Chinese Areas Today</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Today is the Prime Minister's birthday, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau is deeply concerned that general troublemakers may take advantage of the opportunity to create disturbances and disrupt public order. It has ordered the district chiefs of each district to strictly order their subordinate police officers to strengthen prevention. The police stations in charge of the areas bordering the Chinese Concession have been fully armed to prevent disturbances and maintain the usual state of martial law.</p>
<p>▲The Public Concession</p>
<p>The public security authorities in the Public Concession believe that there may be reactionary elements inciting ignorant people to take advantage of the Prime Minister's birthday to create riots, so the General Inspector's Office has issued a notice to all police stations to strengthen prevention. Police stations in Hongkou, Huishan, Gordon Road, Yangshupu, and other areas are particularly vigilant because they are located on the border or are areas where Japanese laborers congregate. Chinese and Western detectives and police officers will all be out on patrol today to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>▲The French Concession</p>
<p>All police stations in the French Concession received orders from their superiors yesterday stating that today is the Prime Minister's birthday and that they should pay attention to protection. Therefore, today, police stations on Avenue Edward VII, Avenue des Deux Rois, Rue Montauban, and other roads have sent Chinese and Western detectives and plainclothes police officers to patrol secretly. Other armed police officers are also patrolling in their respective jurisdictions to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee's Proclamation to the Public Regarding the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>▲ Listing Five Points… Announcing to All Sectors</p>
<p>The Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang commenced its opening ceremony in Nanjing today.  The representatives selected from this city, with the exception of Wu Kaixian who had already proceeded to Nanjing the day before yesterday, including Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Yingpeng, Wang Yansong, Hou Dachun, Zhang Tinghao, Chen Xizeng, etc., also departed last night to attend.  The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Executive Committee, for the opening of the Fourth National Congress yesterday, specially issued a proclamation to the public, listing the five major significances of this congress. The original text is recorded as follows: Beloved citizens, today is the birthday of the Premier, and at the same time, our party is holding the Fourth National Congress in the capital.  The convocation of this Fourth National Congress is indeed of the utmost significance. First, to safeguard the historical foundation of the party, our party, since its establishment, has transitioned from the Revive China Society, the Tongmenghui, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, to the Chinese Kuomintang. Although the names have been changed repeatedly, and the organization has been altered many times, the revolutionary doctrine and the revolutionary cause have remained completely consistent.  Since the reorganization of our party in the thirteenth year of the Republic, there have been a total of three National Congresses. The first was held in Guangzhou in January of the thirteenth year, the second was held in Guangzhou in January of the fifteenth year, and the third was delayed until March of the eighteenth year due to the Northern Expedition and the purification of the party, before it could be held in Nanjing.  The convocation of this Fourth National Congress is to continue the lineage of the Third National Congress, to safeguard the historical foundation of our party, so that our party can be further promoted and fulfill its historical mission. Therefore, safeguarding the foundation and building on the past is the most important significance of convening this congress.  Second, to promote the effectiveness of party governance, our party, according to the mission given by the revolution and in accordance with the Premier's revolutionary strategy, represents the people in exercising political power during the military administration and tutelage periods, and undertakes the work of nation-building and governing the country.  The mission is truly of utmost importance. Since the beginning of national unification and the implementation of tutelage, considerable achievements have been made in nation-building, and party governance has gradually gotten on track.  In the future, we should continue to build on this grand plan, intensify the promotion of the effectiveness of party governance, and strive to achieve rapid progress in construction and complete the tutelage work as scheduled. The National Congress, as the highest authority of our party, has the full responsibility to promote the effectiveness of party governance.  Therefore, the convocation of this National Congress is a major initiative to promote the effectiveness of party governance. Third, to strengthen the party's organization and unity, if our party is to complete the mission of nation-building and governing the country as scheduled, we must first seek to strengthen the party itself and unite the comrades within the party.  Otherwise, if the party itself is not yet sound, how can it govern the country? If the comrades within the party cannot unite, how can they seek to strengthen the party? Therefore, knowing whether the historical mission of our party can be completed quickly depends entirely on whether the party itself can be sound and whether the comrades within the party can unite.  In the past, the organization of our party was relatively sound, and comrades were generally able to unite sincerely, which enabled us to overcome reaction and govern the country. In the future, the party should continue to intensify the unity among comrades, in order to further strengthen the party itself.  The convocation of this National Congress is an important gathering to intensify the practical unity of comrades within the party and to strengthen the organization of the party itself. Fourth, to consolidate the unity and peace of the party and the country, the greatest suffering felt by the whole country in recent years has been war and poverty.  Therefore, we yearn for peace and unity to eliminate war, and for economic development to alleviate suffering. Comrades of our party and the people of the whole country have sacrificed countless lives and properties to create the unified and peaceful situation of today.  This hard-won and most valuable achievement should be protected by the will and strength of all party members and the people of the whole country, and further efforts should be made in economic development to alleviate the suffering after natural disasters and wars.  The convocation of this National Congress is a major measure to respond to the aspirations and needs of the people of the whole country, concentrate the will and strength of the entire party, to consolidate the peace and unity of the party and the country, and to alleviate the suffering of the people.  Fifth, to concentrate the strength of the entire party to face the national crisis together, the purpose of our party's revolution is to eliminate feudal warlords and overthrow imperialism. For several years, we have aimed at this goal, fighting against warlords and imperialism.  Now, domestic warlords have been initially eliminated through the efforts of comrades of our party and the assistance of the people. However, the Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of our national disasters and misfortunes, disregarding all national laws and justice, have blatantly invaded Liaoning and Jilin, plundering our property, burning our cities, raping our women, and killing our officials.  This barbaric atrocity is unprecedentedly tragic. Our party, faced with this national humiliation, vows to concentrate the strength of the entire party to fight a decisive battle with the brutal Japanese, so as to ensure that the complete Chinese territory and sovereignty are not damaged, and to achieve the goal of overthrowing Japanese imperialism.  Our party's convocation of this National Congress has the most important mission of facing the national crisis together and washing away the national humiliation. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee.</p>

<p>▲ Telegram from the Teachers and Staff of Wu Ben Girls' High School to Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province, Honorable Sir: Lamenting that Heaven has brought misfortune to our country, encountering repeated disasters, all human beings feel deep sympathy. The brutal Japanese take the opportunity to create incidents, disregarding the justice of the whole world, destroying the peace of East Asia, slaughtering our borders, and insulting our people. The cruelty of the burning and killing is unprecedented. All those with blood and breath are filled with anger and fury. Recently, they have colluded with Mongolian bandits, plotting to seize Heilongjiang Province, looking down upon the international community, and threatening the alliance. They boast of their elite troops, fiercely encircling and attacking. Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, the officials have no intention of defending the territory, the border defenses have retreated on their own, and the soldiers have suffered the humiliation of dragging their weapons. But you, sir, led armed compatriots to rise up and attack. The glory of the nation is preserved. The national spirit has been boosted a hundredfold. As the news of victory spread, all voices were excited. We still hope that you, as the pillar of heaven, will continue to work hard, bravely resist the enemy, and restore our mountains and rivers. The people of our school pledge to be your backing. We respectfully send this telegram of condolence to fight for the country. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Teachers and Staff of Shanghai Wu Ben Girls' High School, respectfully. Wen.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from the YMCA Anti-Japanese Association to Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province, Qiqihar: Chairman Ma, The Japanese invaders have come.

The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Shanghai YMCA Members. Jia.</p>

Please investigate and clarify the matter and make a statement to all sectors. What should be done? (Attached: one bayonet) Decision: Handed over to the Investigation Department for review and reply within three days. (Three letters to all sectors and businesses are recorded separately below.)</p>

A report must be submitted to the association every ten days. Now that the national crisis is becoming more urgent and funds are in great need, the collection of this national salvation fund will commence immediately.

This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to Various Businesses Regarding the Addition of a "Non-Japanese Goods" Mark</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association yesterday sent a notice to various institutions, organizations, companies, and businesses: We are writing to inform you that the Shanghai CPA Association Standing Committee Xi Yushu and others have suggested to our association that the personnel of all institutions, organizations, companies, and businesses should be advised by the responsible personnel to not purchase Japanese goods. If there is a violation, the person should be immediately dismissed, and the responsible person will bear the responsibility and be permanently banned. All businesses selling goods must add a mark on the invoice stating "This product is definitely not a Japanese product. If it is not true, a penalty of ten times the price will be imposed." so that purchasers who cannot identify the goods will not mistakenly purchase them. We hope that you will consider these suggestions separately and implement them in practice. It is essential to have a determination to resist Japan, and boycotting goods must be sustained. The methods proposed by Mr. Xi and others enable people to take responsibility for themselves and monitor each other, which is indeed appropriate and effective. We hope that all institutions, organizations, companies, and businesses will fulfill their duties and follow suit. With clear responsibilities, the center will be honest. We also hope that our patriotic compatriots will refuse to purchase goods that cannot be identified unless the store adds a responsible mark. We hereby notify you, hoping for your attention and consideration.</p>
<p>▲ Store Managers Are Not Allowed to Suppress National Salvation Movements</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association yesterday also notified store managers that they should not suppress apprentices from engaging in national salvation movements: We are writing to inform you that since the outbreak of the Japanese disaster, the whole country has been in an uproar. Our compatriots from all sectors have been aroused by righteous indignation, running around weeping and engaging in national salvation movements. However, our association has repeatedly received letters from workers and apprentices in the commercial and industrial sectors stating that they have been subjected to oppression by store owners or managers due to differences in positions. They are often angry and ashamed when they discourage the entry of Japanese goods, resulting in being suspended from their jobs or being abused. This situation is extremely hateful. Therefore, we specially announce to store managers from all sectors that if there are any more cases of suppressing workers and apprentices from engaging in national salvation movements, the oppressed person is allowed to report it to the association for punishment. Please take note of this matter.</p>

The Weights and Measures Verification Institute, in conjunction with the various district offices, dispatched personnel daily to conduct inspections, which have now been completed. It is now learned that the aforementioned bureaus have also formulated a schedule for the regular inspection of the four districts of Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, and Jiangwan, which has been jointly announced and is scheduled to commence on the 18th of this month. Anyone found using old measures at that time will be punished according to the law. The announcement and inspection schedule are appended below.

<h3>Health Bureau to Regularly Vaccinate Factory Workers Against Smallpox</h3>
<p>▲ From the 16th to the End of December</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau considers smallpox to be a legally defined infectious disease, which is extremely harmful once contracted. To prevent epidemics, it dispatches personnel twice a year, in spring and autumn, in accordance with Article 6 of the Ministry's promulgated Vaccination Regulations, to factories of all sizes throughout the city to vaccinate all staff and workers' children against smallpox for prevention. It is reported that the period for factory vaccination has been set from the 16th of this month to the end of December. All factories were notified yesterday so that personnel can be sent to administer vaccinations at the appropriate time.</p>
<h3>Suspension of North and South Ocean Shipping Routes by Japanese Steamships</h3>
<p>▲ Citing Tianjin Unrest as Pretext ▲ Dismissing Chinese Employees</p>
<p>▲ Japanese merchant ships suspend sailings on the Tianjin-Shanghai-Tianjin route. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha operates two ships, the Keisaki Maru and the Heiryū Maru, transporting Japanese goods to North China, and their business is quite good. Recently, since the Japanese disturbed Tianjin, Japanese warships were dispatched to Tianjin. Japanese merchant ships in Tianjin are under the protection of the navy. Yesterday, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha decided to abolish the Tianjin route. The Keisaki Maru is scheduled to suspend operations from tomorrow, and the Heiryū Maru will cease operations on the 15th. After these ships stop serving the North Ocean route, they will be redeployed to Taiwan.</p>
<p>▲ Nisshin Shosen Kaisha reduces the number of coastal routes. Nisshin Shosen Kaisha's Yangtze River ships have already been suspended. Currently, the company still operates two coastal routes: one is the North Ocean route, served by the Kwasan Maru and the Tozan Maru; the other is the South China route, served by the Rosan Maru and the Suzan Maru. In the past two months, North and South Ocean ports have unanimously boycotted Japan. The company's four ships often sail empty. Recently, stevedores and barge workers in Shantou, Amoy, and other ports have also resisted. With the unrest in Tianjin, the company decided yesterday that the excessive losses from sailing empty ships are too great, but suspending operations would risk losing the routes. A compromise was proposed: one ship on each of the North and South Ocean routes will be temporarily suspended, leaving the Rosan Maru and the Kwasan Maru to maintain the routes with difficulty. This can be implemented next week.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese ships dismiss Chinese staff. More than ten Japanese ships have been suspended, resulting in a considerable number of Chinese sailors and other crew members losing their jobs. Nisshin Shosen Kaisha alone has more than 3,500 Chinese sailors, crew members, and office staff in various ports. Since this month, about 2,000 have been dismissed due to ship suspensions. Another 160-170 are expected to be dismissed next week.</p>
<h3>Ship Collision in Fog on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Ship Collides with Japanese Warship. Due to fog in this city the last two days, ships entering and leaving the port have been delayed. The Japanese cruiser Tokiwa Maru, anchored in the Huangpu River at the tenth buoy, was struck by the Japanese ship Saiho Maru at 8:20 a.m. yesterday. As two barges were passing by, the Saiho Maru was unable to avoid them and struck the warship's outer shell of the first compartment. The warship, anchored in the river, was unable to move aside, resulting in damage to the outer hull of the bow compartment by the Saiho Maru, measuring approximately 15 feet in length. Repairs are underway.</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Paris Damaged. The Osaka Company's Paris Maru, arriving in Shanghai from Europe, was anchored in the Huangpu River at the fifteenth buoy, unloading cargo. At 8:15 a.m. on the 9th, the fog had not yet dissipated, and the river was completely obscured. A small steamship passing by the outer side suddenly encountered another ship. The small steamship avoided as usual, but its bow struck the left side of the Paris Maru, damaging the steel plates. The small steamship also sustained minor damage. Yesterday, the Osaka Company sent personnel to inspect the damage, and repairs will be carried out in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zheng Gongyao, Captain of the Minsheng Warship, Takes Office Today</h3>
<p>▲ Total Crew of 98 Officers and Men ▲ Sails to the Capital for Military Exercises After the Flag Raising</p>
<p>The Minsheng warship, the fifth new vessel built by the Naval Ministry, will raise its flag today, and the ship's captain will be sworn into office. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Captain Takes Office. Zheng Gongyao, the captain of the ship, is a staff colonel and commander of the Naval Training Fleet. Having received the order to assume his new post, he reported for duty on the first of this month. The vice-captain, Nie Xiyu, is transferred from the vice-captain position on the Minquan warship. Both will be sworn into office simultaneously at 9:00 a.m. today on the ship. In addition to inviting various ship captains to participate, Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Naval Fleet, will represent the Naval Ministry to administer the oath.</p>
<p>▲ Total Officers and Crew. The ship's total officers and crew, excluding service personnel, number 98. Currently appointed by the Ministry, in addition to the two captains Zheng and Nie, there are also Chief Engineer Huang Yiqing, Gunnery Officer Xu Renhao, Chief Electrical Officer He Sijing, Navigation Officer Lang Jiancheng, Assistant Engineers Xu Zhenqian and Lin Jia, and Secretary Guo Shaochang (the medical officer has not yet been appointed by the Ministry). The remaining 86 are soldiers.</p>
<p>▲ Sails to the Capital Today. The ship received an order from the Naval Ministry yesterday, instructing it to sail to Baguazhou in the capital today after the ship's captain is sworn into office and the flag is officially raised, to participate in military exercises for inspection. Therefore, the ship was fired up yesterday, ready to depart. It is scheduled to make its maiden voyage to the capital around 10:00 a.m. today after the flag raising.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Disinfection Fees for Inland Harbor Vessels</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the National Seaport Quarantine Bureau yesterday, requesting free disinfection for vessels in the inner harbor. The letter stated: "We are writing to you regarding the letter received on the 11th of this month from the Inland River Steamer Industry Association, concerning the National Seaport Quarantine Bureau's enforcement of fees. The association states that there is no precedent for such fees, and inland river vessels travel very short distances and are free from epidemics, making disinfection unnecessary. On October 21st, the association wrote to your esteemed organization, requesting that you present this matter to the Social Affairs Bureau and request that it be stopped, and also requested the Public Security Bureau to delay sending police to assist the bureau in collecting fees. Subsequently, we received your letter No. Pu Zi 1194, stating that it had been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for consultation on cancellation and that the Public Security Bureau had been asked to mediate. A reply would be sent separately after receiving the response. Later, we received your letter No. Pu Zi 1290, stating that the Public Security Bureau replied that the National Seaport Quarantine Bureau is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior and should be asked to explain the matter. Since this matter has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for consultation on revocation, it should be handled by the bureau, and there is no need to submit it directly to the Ministry of Interior. We await the Social Affairs Bureau's decision. However, the Quarantine Bureau continues to send Chinese and foreign personnel to forcibly collect fees from various shipping companies, and their actions are even more aggressive than before. Yesterday, the Association's member, Xie Xing Shipping Company, reported that the Quarantine Bureau had been forcing them to pay fees for days. When they explained that they were in the process of consulting on cancellation, the Quarantine Bureau replied, 'We only know about collecting fees, nothing else,' and threatened to pry off the ship's plate and detain the ship. They also forced the company's employees to go to the Quarantine Bureau to make a statement and said that they would come back tomorrow to collect the fees, and if they still did not pay, they would not be lenient. Merchants are timid and fear government officials like gods. Even if they have a reason, how would they dare to argue with them? Moreover, with the collaboration of the water patrol officers, they can implement the threat to detain the ship with a single word, which would inevitably lead to the stagnation of the shipping industry. Therefore, we are writing to you again, requesting that your esteemed organization write to the Social Affairs Bureau to stop this and immediately write to the Second Squadron of the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team (Captain Li, address at Xin Zha Bridge) to delay sending personnel to assist the Quarantine Bureau in collecting fees, so that we can quietly await the Social Affairs Bureau's decision. We have learned that our association sent a letter to your esteemed organization on August 12th, stating that the fee schedule attached to the Quarantine Regulations does not explicitly mention fees for small boats and requested an explanation. Your esteemed organization did not respond. It was not until October 24th that you sent the Regulations for Disinfection of Inland Harbor Vessels to the respective associations, which included the text of separate fees. However, your esteemed organization began collecting fees from small boats around July 20th of this year. The time of fee collection was more than three months apart from the time of formulating the regulations. It is not known on what basis the fees were collected before. Moreover, the disinfection of inland harbor vessels is a novel initiative. Your esteemed organization's letter of October 24th also mentioned that misunderstandings often occur. Therefore, public sentiment must be respected, and the attitude in dealing with matters should be peaceful. When the city launched the business tax, it widely solicited opinions from merchants and residents, held meetings for discussion, and deliberated repeatedly. It has been almost a year, and implementation is still pending, which demonstrates the fair and peaceful attitude of the municipal authorities. The fees collected by your esteemed organization from small boats are essentially a type of handling fee, which should not be equated with municipal taxes. However, you did not invite the relevant industries to openly discuss the matter beforehand. Instead, you detained ships and plates with utmost severity. In your esteemed organization's letter of October 24th, those who raised even the slightest doubt were even treated as stubborn and ignorant. Compared with the city authorities' handling of the business tax, merchants and residents are truly disappointed with the way your esteemed organization has handled things. Our association holds a fair and impartial view that your esteemed organization's expenses are allocated monthly by the Customs Office and do not rely on inner harbor disinfection fees for funding. All disinfection of inner harbor vessels should be provided free of charge so that public sentiment is not aroused. In addition to having telegraphed the Ministry of Interior separately, we are writing this letter to consult you, hoping that you will investigate and handle the matter and provide a response. This is addressed to the National Seaport Quarantine Bureau."</p>

<h3>Second Kidnapping of the President of the Siming Bank</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Yanghe is Already Sixty Years Old ▲ Abducted Yesterday While Driving Home from Qilu</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly Abducted by Bandits En Route ▲ The Chauffeur Was Helpless</p>
<p>Chen Yanghe, the current vice president of the Siming Bank and a native of Ningbo, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Respected in the Banking Industry. Chen is 60 years old this year and lives at No. 17 Siming Village (formerly Chenghe Village) on Foch Road in the French Concession. He has worked at the Siming Bank for many years and is a respected figure in the banking industry. Every day after work, around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., Chen would go to the Qilu Club on Songshan Road in the French Concession to play mahjong for entertainment. This was his daily routine, and he always used his blue car for transportation, with Concession license plate No. 7762 and Municipal plate No. 207, rain or shine. This attracted the attention of bandits.</p>
<p>▲ Four Bandits Jumped Out. Last night, Chen went as usual. Around 9:00 p.m., the mahjong game ended, and he prepared to return home. The chauffeur, Zhong Atao, started the car, intending to drive straight home. Unexpectedly, as they approached the entrance of No. 865 Foch Road, a car suddenly drove towards them from the east. The car was moving very slowly, directly facing Chen's car. The chauffeur, Zhong Atao, quickly braked the car and was about to argue with the oncoming car when four bandits suddenly jumped out of the car, each holding a pistol and warning them to remain silent.</p>
<p>▲ Forcibly Pulled Chen into the Bandits' Car. The four bandits rushed towards Chen's car, first smashing a piece of the right-side window and brandishing their guns to warn them to keep silent. Then, they opened the car door, dragged Chen out of the car, and forced him into the bandits' car, which sped away at full speed and disappeared in an instant. The chauffeur, Atao, witnessed his master being kidnapped and shouted for help. By the time the nearby detectives arrived, it was too late. He then drove the car to the French police station to report the incident. Upon hearing the report, the police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to search in all directions, but to no avail.</p>
<p>▲ Once Kidnapped Last Year. Afterwards, the police station notified Chen's family by telephone and questioned the chauffeur in detail, asking if he had clearly seen the license plate of the bandits' car. He claimed that he was in a state of panic at the time his master was abducted, and when he looked back, the taillights of the car were completely dark, and the speed was very fast, making it impossible to discern the details. He only saw that the bandits' car was a black covered car. He also said that Chen had been kidnapped once in August last year on Chengdu Road but was soon ransomed. This was the second time he had been abducted.</p>

<h3>Xu Kesheng's Family Receives Extortion Letters</h3>
<p>▲ Case Cracked by the Fifth District Police Station</p>
<p>Xu Kesheng, a local resident living at No. 11 Hengye Lane, Hengye Road, Tongji Road, Zhabei, is one of the shareholders of the local real estate company. His family is quite wealthy, so he has become the target of bandits. Since the 13th of the month, he has been receiving extortion letters, totaling nine, demanding a large sum of money and arranging a meeting near the bamboo fence in an empty field near Wangjia Wooden Bridge. Xu initially dismissed this type of anonymous extortion as commonplace in Shanghai and paid no attention to it. However, the wording of the last few letters was quite aggressive, and Xu's elderly mother was very worried. Xu could no longer tolerate it and took the previous letters to the Fifth District Police Station to report the matter. Chief Wang immediately ordered Inspector Wang Zhizhang to handle the matter properly. Inspector Wang waited at the designated address several times, but there was no sign of the bandits. Until the 6th of this month, the bandits sent another letter, arranging for Xu to write a reply last night and leave it on the bamboo fence at Wangjia Wooden Bridge. Inspector Wang then instructed Xu to write a letter and supervised several police officers in disguising themselves as peddlers and ambushing the location. Around 10:00 p.m. that night, two people were seen wandering back and forth in the area several times. They reached out and took the reply letter from the bamboo fence. Inspector Wang bravely stepped forward and arrested the two men, taking them to the district for questioning. According to their confession, one was Xu A'gen, 30 years old, from Tongzhou, and the other was Xu Shengkou, 46 years old, also from Tongzhou. They confessed that the scheme was masterminded by their accomplices Xue Zhiming and Peng Xiaobing. Inspector Wang then arrested Xue at his address in Hong'an Lane, Mongol Road, as well as the suspects Pan A'jin, Xue Daoyuan, and Rong A'san, and others. At the same time, he also cooperated with the Public Concession Police to arrest Peng. Under questioning, Rong A'san confessed that he was 38 years old, Xue Daoyuan was 21 years old, and Pan A'jin was 26 years old. Their confessions were unusually cunning. After questioning, Chief Wang immediately sent all the suspects, along with the nine letters, to the Judicial Section for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Clues Found in the Murder for Property Case</h3>
<p>Due to a conspiracy to seize the estate of the late Zhang Linsen in Huayuan Shiqiao, Zhang Qingxiang, the third son (also known as Zhang Fugeng), colluded with his maternal uncle Zhang Quansheng and his mother, Zhang Zhangshi, to plot the murder of his adopted son, Zhang Guoxiang. However, when they opened fire, the second son, Zhang Yuxiang, was also nearby and was shot and killed, while Guoxiang was only injured. The case has been widely discussed, comparing it to the story of "Shuangzhu Feng," where Wen Bizheng's uncle and aunt conspired to murder him but accidentally killed their own son. The Third District Police Station found clues without any initial leads and arrested the defendants Zhang Qingxiang, Zhang Zhangshi, and Zhang Jinshi, and sent them to the District Court for detention and a no-visitation order to ensure thoroughness. The case's handling prosecutor, Shen, also sought details tirelessly and discovered that Zhang Quansheng had exchanged a pistol with Yang Jinbiao of Tangqiao before the incident, indicating premeditated murder. Therefore, he ordered Yang Jinbiao to be summoned yesterday, but he had died of illness a few days ago. His son, Yang Fulin, reported this. Yuxiang's wife, Zhang Baoshi, Guoxiang's wife, Zhang Taoshi, and the fourth son, Zhang Yunxiang, as well as Qingxiang's wife, Zhang Zhuangshi, her mother, Zhuang Yangshi, and neighbors Sheng Jinsheng, Zhu Jinlong, and Zhang Liugen, were summoned to court. After lengthy separate preliminary hearings, they were ordered to leave and await further investigation.</p>
<h3>An Unusual Case of Illegal Union Between a Man and Woman</h3>
<p>▲Both men are rascals ▲Both women claim to be over twenty ▲Gong is detained for six months, Wang's verdict pending</p>
<p>Gong Qiaobao and Miss Yan reside at 367 Dongyouheng Road. Miss Yan, the sixteen-year-old granddaughter of the old woman Yan Wang from Yangzhou, was lured away by Gong Qiaobao (age twenty), a fellow villager, around 5 a.m. on the 26th of last month to stay at the Yingbin Hotel on Fuzhou Road and the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII for about a week. Later, her family reported this to the Harbin Concession Police, who sent Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Gong. However, Miss Yan escaped while they were in the police station and could not be found. Gong was sent to the First Special District Court, and after two interrogations, the woman's statements were inconsistent. This has been reported in this newspaper. The court issued a warrant to bring Miss Yan in for further questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen took his seat in the criminal court for continued questioning. The woman appeared after being arrested. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the woman insisted that she was actually twenty years old. Please inquire. According to the woman's grandmother, Yan Wang, her granddaughter is only sixteen years old, born in the year of the Dragon, on February 11th. The defendant Gong Qiaobao's father is a drifter, and so is Qiaobao, so she does not want her granddaughter to marry him. She hired lawyer Zheng Wenkai to defend her. Please investigate. When questioned, Gong Qiaobao admitted to staying with the woman in hotels, but the woman willingly followed him to live as husband and wife. Previously, her grandmother wanted a bride price of four hundred yuan, which could not be agreed upon. Yan Mei claimed to be twenty years old and asked him to go to the hotel with her. Please consider. Yan Mei claimed to be twenty years old, born in the year of the Rat, on March 16th. She had told her grandmother that she wanted to marry Gong, but her grandmother firmly refused and even beat her, so she ran away and stayed at the hotel with Gong. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao sentenced Gong Qiaobao to six months in prison. The woman was found not guilty and was taken back by Yan Wang to live in peace. The judge declared to the woman that she must not be beaten to avoid any accidents.</p>
<p>▲Wang Aqiao and Qiu Gendi Wang Aqiao, a native of Ningbo, is thirty-two years old and still single. He lives at 3 Dongyouheng Road. He often went to the cigarette paper shop run by Qiu Langqi, a native of Pudong, at 34 Lihongkou Street, and joked with his nineteen-year-old daughter, Gendi. On the 3rd of last month, around 4 p.m., he lured the girl to room 4 of the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road for illicit relations. Later, they resided at Chen Aizhen's house at 678 Beijing Road. After Gendi ran away, her father had people search for her, but she was nowhere to be found. He reported this to the Harbin Concession Police the other day, who sent detectives to arrest Wang Aqiao. After interrogating him and finding out where Gendi was, they secretly went and found her, and brought her back to the police station to be detained separately. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the investigation revealed that the defendant Wang Aqiao is a well-known rogue and has committed other offenses. Please postpone the hearing. According to the plaintiff Qiu Langqi, his daughter Gendi is only nineteen years old. When she was deceived by the defendant, she had fifty yuan in cash and three gold rings, all of which are now missing. He only has this one daughter, and his wife died early. The defendant is a rogue, and his daughter was deceived and blindly followed him. Please consider, and hire a lawyer to defend him. When questioned, Wang Aqiao confessed that he and Gendi rented a camera at the Xin Xin Company amusement park that morning and looked at each other. He told her to go home, but she said that her father would kill her if she went back and that she wanted to live with him. So, they went to the Zhongshan Hotel for two nights, and later stayed at Chen's house on Beijing Road. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Qiu Gendi confessed that she was twenty-one years old, born in the year of the Pig, on August 6th. Because her father often beat her, causing her body to be covered in bruises, she was willing to marry the defendant. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered them to be detained separately for further questioning on a later date.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of Liu Yanyan's Servant by Poisoning</h3>
<p>▲Fan Quangen was interrogated again yesterday▲Re-trial scheduled due to incomplete witness testimony</p>
<p>Fan Quangen, who runs the Fan Zhenxing utensil shop in Zhenfuli, Chenjia浜 small vegetable market, Xinzha Bridge, paid for a ‘shulong’ (formal intimacy) in March with Lao Ba (original name Duan A’er), a servant in the house of prostitute Liu Yanyan at 321 Huile里, Fuzhou Road, agreeing on a price of 300 yuan, with 50 yuan paid upfront. However, after their one-time encounter, Duan did not come again. Upon being pursued for the debt, he ignored it. Duan A’er became depressed as a result. Several days later, Fan went again, leaving at 4 a.m. that day. At this time, Duan suddenly committed suicide by taking opium. It was not until 2 p.m. the next day that the roommate discovered the body, but he had already died and rigor mortis had set in, making rescue impossible. The police were notified, and together with Guo Wei, the prosecutor of the former Special District Court, it was confirmed that he had died from poisoning. The body was handed over to his biological father, Duan Wenyong from Suzhou. Recently, Duan Wenyong, on the grounds of seducing a virgin and instigating suicide, hired three lawyers, Dan Yuhua, Zheng Wenkai, and Liu Hongxun, to file a lawsuit against Fan Quangen in the First Special District Court. Last Wednesday, Judge Feng presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. He asked the plaintiff, Duan Wenyong, to explain how his daughter died. Duan replied that he was still in the countryside at the time and only arrived in Shanghai after A’er died. The detailed circumstances were known to the roommate and Huang Li and others. As Huang Li and others had not arrived, and the defendant was also not present, the hearing was postponed until yesterday. Witness Zhao Zhou stated that she knew Duan A’er and a guest with the surname Fan had quarreled and that Duan died from smoking opium. When she went, the person was already dead. Witness Wu Yao stated that she used to be at Xiangyue and is now in the room opposite Liu Yanyan’s. When she went over, Duan had already died. According to Huang Li, A’er and a guest with the surname Fan had argued, and Duan took opium. Fan came at 12 p.m. and left around 4 a.m. the next morning. For all the details, one could ask Huang Li. Huang Li was then summoned, but because she had not arrived, she could not be questioned. The plaintiff also brought witness Xu Yuxiang, who stated that he accompanied Fan to Liu Yanyan’s place that day. There were guests in the main room, so he and Fan sat in a small room until 12 p.m. before leaving together. The judge asked if he and Fan had returned after 12 p.m. Xu replied that he went home at that time and did not know if Fan had gone back. As the witnesses were not yet complete, the court ordered a retrial next Wednesday. At this point, the plaintiff’s lawyer requested that the defendant be released on bail, while the defendant’s lawyer objected. After a lengthy debate between the two parties, Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be released on bail, subject to being available for questioning at any time, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Lake Bandit Wei Hongxiang</h3>
<p>Wei Hongxiang (nicknamed Changban Ahe), a native of Shanyang and the leader of the lake bandits, used to be a captain under the command of Tai Bao Ashu, the already executed leader of the lake bandits. After Ashu was executed, Wei formed his own gang, leading hundreds of followers, specializing in robbery and kidnapping in the area bordering Songjiang and Jinshan, committing all kinds of evil deeds. The government had repeatedly sent detectives to track him down, but to no avail. Now, Fan Guozhong, the captain of the first patrol of the 洙泾 水警队 (Zhu Jing River Police), learned that the bandit leader was hiding in Shanghai. On the 7th of this month, he, along with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Public Concession Police, arrested the bandit Wei at the Shuangfengyuan teahouse at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hector Road. He was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court for trial and extradition. Captain Fan has prepared a document and personally led his team to Shanghai to take the bandit Wei back to the First District Headquarters of the Minhang River Police and request that District Chief Xu bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Yuxingfang Present a Document to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The tenants of Yuxingfang, Laoshenfu Road, this city, yesterday presented a document to Mayor Zhang, stating, "Presenting a petition for speculation in real estate, causing hardship to the citizens, respectfully requesting that you quickly resolve this issue to benefit the residents." The houses in Yuxingfang, Laoshenfu Road, French Concession of Shanghai, have only been built for seven years. Initially, they were rented out by the British company, Taylor &amp; Co. This spring, the management and rent collection were changed to Liu Chenglin, the director of the real estate department of the lawyer, Tibberk. Two months later, a notice of renovation was issued, asking the tenants to move out before August 1 of this year. The tenants replied according to law and requested that the Shanghai Real Estate Association mediate and continue to collect rent. However, on August 23 of this year, the tenants received a notice from lawyers Shen Qi and Wang Jianfan, representing Changli Company, asking them to vacate the premises by the end of August. At the same time, they also received a notice from the aforementioned real estate department, stating that the transfer of property rights should be announced and declared, otherwise the parties involved would inevitably be affected. Therefore, they sent a letter through the Shanghai Real Estate Association to Liu Chenglin, asking whether it was true, but no reply was received. Unexpectedly, around 3 p.m. on October 2 of this year, the French Water and Electricity Company sent craftsmen to cut off the water supply to the neighborhood, causing a major crisis in terms of life, hygiene, fire prevention, and safety for all residents. The tenants' representatives went to the Water and Electricity Company to inquire about the reason for the water cut. They were told that Liu Chenglin had not paid the water bills since August of this year, claiming that the property rights had been transferred. They went to the transferee mentioned by Liu Chenglin to collect the bills, but were told that the transfer had not been completed and they would not pay. The Water Company, unable to collect the water bills, had no choice but to cut off the water supply. The tenants then managed to raise money and paid off the water bills owed by the landlord. At 3 p.m. on October 5, the Water Company repaired the water source and continued to supply water. This matter has been reported to the Social Bureau for approval. The landlord, seeing that damaging the water source could not achieve the purpose of forced eviction, sent craftsmen to build bamboo fences on the 21st of this month at 9 a.m., hoping to imitate Huang Chu-jiu's actions towards Fuxingli on Zhejiang Road and the New Sassoon Bank's actions towards Qingyunli on Jiangxi Road, using force to demolish and evict the tenants. Now, the tenants continue to be threatened. According to the investigation, the houses were completed on June 1, 1924. At that time, the market was very sluggish. Those who moved in to live and do business expected that it would take at least twenty years for renovation to occur, according to Shanghai custom. Therefore, they paid huge sums of small rent and tips, and invested huge amounts of money in renovation, believing that they could recover the costs over twenty years. The two largest disputes over renting houses in Shanghai have been in litigation for years, all arising from the issue of the age of the houses. This kind of dispute is not initially a violation of the landlord's rights, but rather the exercise of rights that harms public order and good customs. After all, settling down in one's homeland is a virtue of the Chinese nation, and living and working in peace is the foundation of national wealth and strength. The landlord's arbitrary renovation of houses specifically for rent will destroy the national virtue of settling down in one's homeland and the psychology of living and working in peace, and will inevitably harm public order and good customs. According to the investigation, the price of the land and houses this spring was 156,000 Shanghai taels, which Liu Chenglin purchased and resold to the current landlord, becoming more than 200,000 taels. Liu Chenglin made a net profit of 35,000 taels in just six months, which shows the thickness of the speculative profits. Some say that speculation in real estate is no different from speculation in commodities and securities, but in fact, they cannot be compared. The profits and losses of speculation in commodities and securities are borne solely by the speculator. As for speculation in real estate, the profits are solely obtained by the speculator, and the losses are compensated by the tenants. For example, for securities with a face value of 100 yuan and an annual interest rate of 8%, if they are bought for 80 yuan, the annual interest rate is 1%. If the market interest rate is 1.6%, the speculator (i.e., the holder) cannot ask the issuer of the securities to increase the interest to fill their wishes, but can only sell them for cash and make another investment with an annual interest rate of 1.6%. The speculators in real estate are very different. For example, if they buy land and houses in area A, they initially do not care that the annual interest rate of the rent in that area is only 6%. They use the virtue of tenants settling down in their homeland, the psychology of living and working in peace, and the huge investment of small rent and renovation costs, or they first increase the rent unsuccessfully, followed by a notice of renovation, or they first issue a notice of renovation to achieve their purpose of increasing the rent, or they have already increased the rent and cannot immediately increase it again, so they pretend to transfer the property rights and change to another landlord, doing the same thing. As a result, after the rent is increased, the annual interest rate is 8%, and the selling price can be increased. For example, if it is bought for 100,000 taels of silver, it can be sold for more than 130,000 taels after this rent increase. In one transfer, a profit of more than 30,000 taels can be obtained, and this profit is the blood and sweat of the tenants. This is indeed an evil demon that creates serious social problems. Moreover, in recent years, real estate speculators have been concentrated in the Special Zone, which has a significant impact on the development of municipal administration outside the Special Zone. If this kind of real estate speculator is strictly sanctioned, social floating capital can be invested in other areas that urgently need development, and the method of sanction is to impose administrative restrictions on rent increases and renovations. Furthermore, this kind of real estate speculation fundamentally conflicts with your government's public housing plan, and is especially contrary to the principle of benefiting the residents in the National Construction Outline. After all, the construction of public housing by the public is often limited by public funds. If real estate speculation is sanctioned, the effect will be greater than the public construction of public housing. For the sake of the vast majority of citizens who rent houses in the city, for the sake of supporting the public construction of public housing, and for the sake of the principle of benefiting the residents in the National Construction Outline, we should submit a document for your review, humbly requesting that you stop the landlord's behavior of treating citizens as fish and meat, and relieve the citizens from their predicament. The city will be fortunate, and the citizens will be fortunate. Respectfully presented to Zhang, the mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>A Leading Catholic Orders Rejection of Drugs</h3>
<p>▲The Catholic Church assists in rejecting drugs▲Archbishop Gang issues eight instructions</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association, in order to expand the power of the anti-drug military movement, had previously entrusted its member, former Premier Lu Zhengxiang, to request the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church to issue a general order to the national Catholic Church to carry out the anti-drug movement together. It was approved by the Pope, who commended the China National Anti-Drug Association and ordered that all Christian churches in the country should follow suit. It was heard that Dr. Wang Jingqi, the chairman of the association, went to Ping to work and was personally visited by Archbishop Gang, the representative of the Roman Curia in China, who expressed the church's willingness to cooperate sincerely with the Anti-Drug Association. In addition to issuing a general order to all churches in the country to follow suit, he also requested that the Anti-Drug Association send all the promotional materials for the anti-drug movement to the national Catholic Church. This was done, and Huang Jiawei, the director-general of the association, sent a letter of thanks to Archbishop Gang. The instructions of Archbishop Gang are translated as follows for compliance: In accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Bishops' Conference regarding the prohibition of opium, it is necessary to order all bishops to abide by them. This chapter has fully stated the importance of the Catholic Church's relationship to the opium problem. Recently, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, Bassili, also sent a handwritten letter to Lu Zhengxiang, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of China and the current monk in Loping (Belgium), stating that the Holy See's policy on the prohibition of opium remains unchanged. As the responsibility of this Archbishop lies, it is necessary to order all Catholic Churches in China to continue to assist in the anti-drug movement, so as to unify the steps and broaden the effectiveness. The following points are listed for compliance: (1) All pastors must be in awe of the Holy Teachings and must not overstep them. When administering the Holy Sacraments to the faithful, they should pay attention to whether the faithful and protectors have a smoking habit or are planting opium seedlings or selling opium and other similar behaviors when preserving the time of baptism. (2) Although planting and selling drugs are not illegal in China now, the result is tantamount to murder, which is greatly contrary to the Holy Law. (3) When preaching in churches, all pastors should take this opportunity to publicize to the faithful and protectors the harms of opium in terms of material and spiritual matters. (4) In all schools and publications, more efforts should be made to promote the purpose of rejecting drugs. The old and corrupt are deeply addicted and cannot be saved, but for the younger generation, we must make great wishes and urge them not to get addicted to smoking. If the government and public groups work together to carry out the movement, if the church can help, it will be quick and effective, and at least it will achieve good results in terms of future spiritual and material improvement. From the perspective of the relationship between the church and the country, as long as we have the determination and perseverance to cultivate young people, we can achieve results in the shortest possible time. (5) Rejecting drugs is a social propaganda policy, which is also in line with the purpose of preaching and uniting Catholic youth. All people in the church, whether old or young, should strive to help, so as to abide by the Holy Teachings and devote themselves to rejecting drugs. (6) Catholic Churches should issue various leaflets and pamphlets to help promote drug rejection. All such publications can be distributed to the faithful free of charge. (7) This Archbishop recently met with Dr. Wang Jingqi, the chairman of the China National Anti-Drug Association, and agreed to send various slogans, pictures, and other propaganda materials of the Anti-Drug Association to the eleven diocesan offices and Catholic schools of this Catholic Church. If a certain diocese needs a large number of propaganda materials, it can also contact the Anti-Drug Association directly. The Geneva International League's Commission on Narcotics has also entrusted this Catholic Church to devote itself to this social cause related to humanity. (8) The Chinese National Government should adopt a policy of prohibition (such as banning planting and transportation) in order to save this raging tide. This Catholic Church should also assist the Chinese government in educating and persuading it.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>national government to carry it out and strengthen its momentum. The method is to cooperate with the China National Anti-Drug Association. Our Lord Jesus will also sympathize with this move, because the good people in this large part of China, who are innocently suffering from this torture, cannot but arouse the compassion of Christ. A bishop who has been in China for a long time once said from experience that the world has also worked hard to fight against terrible diseases such as tuberculosis, liver cancer, and leprosy, but the above-mentioned diseases are not as harmful as opium, so why turn a blind eye to it? This is a prayer for the blessing of the teachings.</p>
<h3>The District Branch Pleads for the Shantytown Dwellers of Haig Road</h3>
<p>▲Request to forward to the Municipal Government▲Build public housing in West Shanghai as soon as possible</p>
<p>About 200 households of poor people living in thatched sheds along the eastern part of Haig Road near Route Louri, were ordered by the French Concession Police to move out within two weeks. All circles have paid great attention to this. The 28th Branch of the Second District of this city has submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to find a way to rescue them. The text of their submission to the Party Headquarters of the Second District is recorded below: "Submitting a request. It is reported that about 200 households of thatched shed residents along the eastern part of Haig Road will be evicted by the French Concession Police and ordered to move out within two weeks and demolish the thatched sheds, and will not be allowed to live in the territory. It is shocking to read. It is found that the residents there are mostly Jiangbei rickshaw pullers, handcart pullers, coolie workers, and small business operators. They all fled to Shanghai to make a living because of the natural disasters and bandit disasters in Jiangbei over the years. Most of them came to Shanghai to escape the flood this time. Their struggling lives can be seen in general. Moreover, they have been living in thatched sheds there for many years. If they are driven away regardless, they will inevitably be displaced and unable to survive. In addition, the weather will gradually become colder in the future, and their suffering will be even more unpredictable. Our Party has always been concerned about liberating the suffering of the people, and should give them emergency rescue. It is difficult to stand by and watch thousands of compatriots being displaced and unable to survive. Therefore, we respectfully request your association to forward to the Municipal Party Headquarters and send a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting them to quickly build public housing in the West Shanghai area so that the Shanghai civilians can move in. And we also ask you to inform the French Concession authorities that they must not evict the civilians there before the public housing in West Shanghai is built. This matter concerns the suffering of the civilians, and it is reasonable to prepare a document and request your association to review and approve it. We will be very grateful. Respectfully presented to Luo Lie, Standing Committee Member of the 28th Branch of the Second District Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Kuomintang, November 11."</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Dismissal of Workers by the French Municipal Council's Engineering Department</h3>
<p>▲ Originates from the Horse Racing Holiday Issue ▲ The Chinese Friendship Association Held a Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The New Shanghai Society reports that the French Concession Municipal Council has traditionally given a half-day holiday each year during the Western champagne races. On the 4th of this month, for the autumn racing season, the various departments of the Council still followed the old practice and stopped work in the afternoon. Peng Jinfu, the head foreman of the Council's Engineering Department, also asked the director for leave at noon. The director immediately stated that work would stop in the afternoon. Workers then returned home. Unexpectedly, the director issued a notice after the workers had left, stating that those who did not work this afternoon would be dismissed. Some workers living nearby heard the news and immediately returned to work. Those living further away received the news late. The next day, when the workers went to work, they were refused and announced the dismissal of 31 workers. The dismissed workers immediately reported to the Chinese Friendship Association, requesting assistance in restoring their jobs. Qiu Zhanggang, a standing committee member of the association, led the workers to negotiate with the director-general of the Council, Fan Erde (transliteration). As a result, they returned without success. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the association convened an emergency meeting of all group leaders and general and deputy officers. More than 200 representatives attended. The city party headquarters also sent Zhou Funong to attend. Shen Caigeng presided over the meeting, and Zheng Fengchu recorded the minutes. After the opening formalities, the chairman first reported the meaning of the meeting's convocation. Subsequently, it was resolved that, in addition to requesting the city party headquarters to negotiate with the French authorities for the restoration of work, all workers should unite and help each other in the spirit of mutual assistance to seek the benefits to which they are entitled under the overall settlement conditions. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Dongmei Rescued from Abuse</h3>
<p>An elderly woman surnamed Wu, residing in the west wing downstairs at No. 18, Lane 5, Ximen Road, French Concession, kept a maid named Dongmei, aged ten. Dongmei was often beaten with sticks and burned with fire by Wu, leaving scars all over her body. This matter came to the attention of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. The association immediately sent Inspector Wang of the Protection Department, accompanied by Chinese detectives from the Loujiawan French police station, to investigate the matter. Unexpectedly, the old woman had taken Dongmei out, leaving only the wet nurse at home. They found no clues. When they reinvestigated the next day, the door was locked, and the whole family had fled. The inspector and the Chinese detectives, seeing that they had fled in fear of punishment, were certain that they had been abused. Just as they were about to return to the police station to arrest them closely, a righteous person named Wu Hongzhang, who claimed to know that the old woman abused the maid, said that if they could postpone the arrest for a day, he would find Dongmei and punish the person involved according to the severity of the injuries. The next afternoon at 4:00 PM, he brought the abused maid Dongmei to them. Inspector Wang and others carefully examined the girl's arms and face and found obvious burns and stick marks with many scars. They registered and photographed her and took her to the police station. After detailed examination and inquiry by Minister Bo of the Morality Department and translator Ren, it was determined that although the girl had no internal injuries, keeping maids was prohibited by national law. Therefore, they immediately ordered her to be handed over to the Children's Welfare Association for care. The person involved was treated leniently and not detained. The detectives were also instructed to prevent her from keeping maids again.</p>

<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>▲ Bean and Rice Industry: The rice measures required by the Bean and Rice Industry Association have always been manufactured by the Rengu Public Office. Members of the industry who need them must obtain them from the Public Office after they have been calibrated before they can be used. The standard has always been the Hai measure, which is no longer applicable. A new type of rice measure has been manufactured, with each measure being four dou and two sheng, and each shi being eight dou and four sheng. Five hundred have been manufactured and a resolution has been passed in a meeting to distribute them to each shop in the first month of the lunar calendar next year for practical use, and to abolish the old-fashioned Hai measures that are not applicable. The association believes that the new rice measure is different from the Hai measure, so it must be trained in advance to avoid disputes with boatmen after implementation. It is now scheduled to begin training on the 15th of this month. However, the measure clerks of each shop must report to the association for registration. The association is now notifying the north and south shops to inform the measure clerks to report for registration, limited to the 14th. Those who do not register will not be hired. The leaders of the rice industry groups are also notified to come to the meeting to supervise. It is said that this reform is very serious. If the clerks who are trained in the new measures are qualified, the shops may continue to hire them as usual. Therefore, the clerks who have been hired by the shops for two or three years are very alarmed. The clerks are discussing and requesting the association to postpone the registration and training. It is unknown whether this can be done.</p>
<p>▲ Rickshaw Industry: The Rickshaw Industry Association issued a notice yesterday for the establishment of a relief section, stating: "With all due respect, in recent years, during the floods in Jiangbei, rural rickshaw pullers have gathered in Shanghai. There are some unemployed vagrants who specialize in stealing vehicles and harming rickshaw pullers as their profession. The theft of cars for ransom has been seen for a long time, but recently it has become more and more serious, happening several times a day. It is unbearable to see. Although the police and government have repeatedly issued orders, strictly investigating and banning them, these thieves are incorrigible, disregarding the law, and dare to openly harm the business of car dealers and harm rickshaw pullers, which is very infuriating. Therefore, the Executive Committee of this association resolved on November 10 that, in order to prevent car theft, we should unite actively. All those with more than 500 rickshaws can automatically form a group and hold a no-ransom doctrine. We deeply hope that everyone will have the spirit of unyielding righteousness and never redeem the car, so as to consistently eliminate the phenomenon of car theft, then the future of our car industry is full of hope. With all due respect, I would like to express my views. Enclosed is a brief regulation on the Relief Section of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association. Article 1: This section is organized in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Articles of Association of this Association. Article 2: The purpose of this section is to gather the strength of the group, prevent car theft and ransom, and increase the welfare of car dealers and rickshaw pullers, and everyone should hold the doctrine of no redemption. Article 3: Vehicles in this city can automatically gather five vehicles and automatically form a group. A group may nominate five to seven managers and elect a group leader. The group leader may participate in handling the overall relief affairs of the section. Article 4: The powers of each group's office are to investigate and handle the daily affairs of the group, and compensate for car losses, etc. All external documents, publicity, etc., are handled by the association. Article 5: If a vehicle is stolen, the group leader shall report it to the section, and the section shall forward it to the association to request the competent authority to pay attention to the investigation and publish it in the newspaper. Article 6: The section shall have two directors, who shall be nominated by the Executive Committee of the association from the executive committee members, and shall jointly handle the daily relief affairs with the standing committee members of the association and the group leaders. Article 7: The car compensation method is divided into the following five items: (1) If a vehicle is stolen, regardless of whether it is new or old, each vehicle in the group shall pay five-sixths of the compensation, and the rickshaw puller shall pay one-sixth of the compensation, and a new car shall be purchased for business. If it is insufficient, the car owner shall supplement it. (2) If the car is stolen from the car owner's home, it shall be handled automatically by each group. If the rickshaw puller runs away (commonly known as 'stealing the car'), it is the car owner's improper employment and is not an example of compensation. (3) After the vehicle is stolen, the responsible persons of each organization shall be immediately informed of the process, and then the group leader shall report it to the section for record, and send a letter to each district office and the competent authority to pay attention to the investigation and pay attention to the traces of the vehicle. (4) After the vehicle is compensated, and the original vehicle is found, if rubber pads and other accessories are lost, they shall be compensated according to the new ones, otherwise, a reasonable amount of car rental loss shall be given, but the amount of compensation that has been paid shall be refunded in full. (5) If the car owner and the rickshaw puller collude to deceive the same industry and privately redeem the car, once the investigation is verified, the association shall request the competent authority to deal with it according to law and revoke its license plate as a warning. Article 8: The daily expenses of this section (such as paper, pens, etc.) shall be borne by the association. Article 9: The car compensation funds of each group shall be collected by each group's own deliberation. However, at the end of each month, each group must report the economic income and expenditure and the number of car compensation and lost cars to the section for statistical registration. Article 10: This brief regulation shall be implemented after being approved by the Executive Committee of the Association. Article 11: If there are any matters not covered in this brief regulation, the Executive Committee of the Association shall amend it."</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>In the local news column of your newspaper on the 9th of this month, there was a news item about the petition to the peace representatives by the labor union representatives of this city. Among them were the names “National Medicine Labor Union” and “National Medicine Industry Workers Union.” Upon investigation, the only trade union for national medicine workers in this city, apart from the dissolved (Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers Union), has no other name. It is suspected that there was an error in your newspaper’s reporting. Therefore, this letter is specially prepared for clarification and correction. We sincerely request that this letter be published in the “Letters to the Editor” column.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers Union.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhu Daquan’s News (Omitted)</h3>
<p>(National Products Should Not Increase in Price Amidst the Strong Anti-Japanese Resistance)</p>
<p>(Answer) At this time when the whole country is unanimously boycotting Japanese goods, it is indeed hateful for domestic product manufacturers or merchants to take advantage of the opportunity to temporarily raise the prices of domestic goods. If this is the case, they should ask themselves if their conscience feels uneasy. However, a distinction must be made. Domestic product manufacturers also have their own unspeakable difficulties. China’s manufacturing experience is not as extensive as that of foreign countries, management is not as scientific as that of foreign countries, production and sales are not as wide as those of foreign countries, and government assistance to industrialists is not as strong as that of foreign countries. Therefore, it is indeed extremely difficult to demand that the price of domestic goods be lower than that of foreign goods in this immature stage. We on the social side must also forgive them for this. However, if the original price of a domestic product was not so high and it is suddenly raised temporarily, then that is absolutely unacceptable. Patriotic industrialists and merchants should definitely not do this.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Introducing "To the Youth"</h3>
<p>— Qi Ren</p>
<p>Recently, it has been truly difficult to find reading material that directly guides young people. It's not that there is nothing for young people to read. In recent years, since the wave of the New Literature movement has risen, the quantity of magazines and publications, to say the least, has been astonishing. But in terms of quality, they only indirectly guide young people by citing examples, and rarely contribute their own experiences to young people. Therefore, what young people gain is at most just an image in their minds, thinking that this is a "category."</p>
<p>Although, I have found a few books after all. Zhu Guangqian's "Twelve Letters to Young People" and Shu Xincheng's "Letter to Young People" both have decent content. Here, I have found a third book, Xia Ruimin's "To the Youth," which I will enthusiastically introduce to you respectable and beloved young people.</p>
<p>The author is someone who has just passed through the "youth" stage and is about to step into "adulthood." He has experienced the beautiful youth that ordinary people go through, and he hasn't completely left it yet. He has an image in his mind that won't be lost immediately, and he has released it and written this book.</p>
<p>Therefore, this book will be more substantial than "Twelve Letters to Young People" and more intimate than "Letter to Young People."</p>
<p>The author is a genuine and courageous young man. He says, "I simply do not acknowledge the existence of so-called geniuses or intelligent people in this world. They are made that way by their environment. I believe that the acquisition of experience is the only 'correctness' that does not deceive. I advise young people not to hope to become 'supermen,' but rather to be serious and down-to-earth." When this national crisis is upon us and ordinary bewildered young people are still at a loss, this book is enough to make them feel excited, and at least it can point them to a correct path to take.</p>
<p>People are absolutely dominated by their environment and history. What kind of era produces what kind of youth. The author cannot escape this scope, so he has also enjoyed pleasure, suffered hardship, and experienced all kinds of things. He wants to leave these things for those who come later to see, to write down what he has truly personally experienced, as a historical record of a young person in a certain era. So he says,</p>
<p>"Looking back, when I was young, I also talked grandly about studies, pursued love, participated in various sports, liked to show off, and wanted to become a writer. In short, what ordinary young people tacitly hope for, I could not escape this scope either. Recently, I really want to leave a trace of the path I have walked, as a memorial to myself. The next biggest reason is that I want to reverently contribute to the modern lovable youth, as a first meeting gift, because these are my fragmented personal insights. I dare not exaggerate in any way, I can only say that they are some records of my youth journey, a faithful plea to modern youth." Therefore, we know how the author wants to offer his sincere heart.</p>
<p>The characteristic of this book is that it shows the author passing through the "bridge of youth" amidst difficulties and hardships, with various harsh environments tempting him. The fragile heart of youth cannot easily avoid these demons. Therefore, the author has also personally tasted these things. But precisely because the environment is making him fall, it is all the more sufficient to forge his strong spirit. The environment is making him fall everywhere, but his indomitable will confronts it everywhere. When he was living through his youth, he didn't feel anything, but when he got older, he felt that he had crossed many dangerous bridges. Thinking back, it makes him feel chilled. So the purpose of writing this book is to tell young people, what kind of road is placed in front of you, and how you will have to be careful to deal with it. So he says, "...and now there are many young people groping in the dark, and perhaps it is not without benefit to look at the records of these pioneers (one who groped in the dark before you)."</p>
<p>Therefore, this book is still an autobiography of youth. The author painstakingly offers what he has personally experienced to younger youth, so that they can see what kind of road the pioneers have taken, what kind of situation they have encountered, and then perhaps they can walk more steadily and practically on their own journey.</p>
<p>The author also deeply understands the current generation of young people's boredom with the times. Therefore, he also uses an encouraging tone to lead young people onto the right path. He says,</p>
<p>"The waves of the times are constantly stirring up huge tides, causing each and every young person to be confused and walk towards the ivory tower or the intersection of the crossroads. But we must not listen to other people's declarations and be bewildered and at a loss. We can only fulfill our own responsibilities, hold on to the times, and move forward..."</p>
<p>This book especially emphasizes young literary people. The author sees that they like literature, which is of course gratifying, but it is quite dangerous for some people to like to create at every turn. So he says,</p>
<p>"Literature is ultimately an art. What it needs is generally fluent writing and trained writing, and especially what it needs is the life, passion, and genius of general art. The cultivation of this passion and genius requires real literary cultivation..."</p>
<p>The diction of this book is also very beautiful, making people feel quite happy to read it. He always uses some elegant sentences to adjust in each chapter.</p>
<p>"Jianfu, the weather is very warm today, and the small river flows down from the hillside with rippling shallow waves, shining in the sunlight. The campus is covered with the tender green of early spring, and rose trees and poplar trees are blooming and growing. The tender leaves are slightly green, and there are small birds singing everywhere. A spring atmosphere arises in the rural air, and infinite joy shines on the silent space. All energy is about to grow from the earth." Also,</p>
<p>"...Outside, the flowing water and the clear sound of the spring vibrate my soul, thus making me remember you..."</p>
<p>In short, │This book is a pure and sincere expression of the heart of a young person, and it becomes an experienced guide, which cannot be compared with general empty discussions.</p>
<p>Finally, I will end with the author's words:</p>
<p>"When you know that spring has come, especially do not forget that you are a young person, and you should work doubly hard in your youth. I advise you to put down a glass of fine wine in your left hand and raise your right hand to proceed, proceed."</p>
