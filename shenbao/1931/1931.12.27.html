<p>時評</p>
<h3>對内與對外</h3>
<p>自政局急轉直下。黨國領袖以及全國人民都歡形於色。。一則以爲今後政自我爲。應多展我抱負之機。一則以爲外患緊急。今後庶幾其有一致對外共赴國難之望。吾人料知此兩種不同之心理。爲當前之一大矛盾。如黨政領袖。</p>
<p>今後仍不能有澈底悔禍協力以紓國難之精誠。則新政府仍將無以饜人民之望。政局前途。仍未可樂觀。故曾以新政府必從實質上表現其新。而勿徒從形式上與個人之成功上慶祝其新。鄭重爲新政府勗。</p>
<p>今日之事。解决國内之問題急。而抗禦强寇收回失地尤急。蓋前者如果眞我國内上下。都能基於國家與人民之福利上而精誠合作。則對内諸問題。自都可迎刃而解斷不至成爲若何棘手之問題而强寇踞我半壁河山。且正逞其野心。節節進逼置我國家民族於生死綫上。此則我國家當前極其嚴重迫切之問題。應如何作切實而有效之抗制亦至爲迫切而不容刻緩。抑且我人深信今日惟有一致對外。始可以解决國内各種矛盾。若日斷斷於對内問題之爭執。則爭執將永無已時。而問題亦永無解决之日。能否一致對外。爲衡度黨政領袖能否一致團結之水準。同時亦即新政府能否博得人民之擁護。能</p>
<p>否確立其基礎之關鍵。</p>
<p>然而依據目前之形勢而觀。吾人誠不免失望。自一中全會開幕以來萬目睽睽。莫不仰望大會從速確定外交方針。頒示全國俾國。民能在一致之政策與統一之行動下。效命於國家。以救國而自救乃大會開幕。瞬近一週。其日所爭持者爲政治制度之改革。爲主席院長以至各部人選之磋商。鈎心鬥角。互相爭持寗粤之分。迄未能泯。而對於迫在目前之外交問題。則無一語討論及之。據日前報紙上所批露則且明言外交與黨務毫無辦法。如其果眞則吾人不能不認新政府之已步入過去覆軌。新政府仍無决心共赴當前之國難。新政府與舊政府之分。僅爲制度之改革。人員之更迭形雖不同而質則無以異。　　一中全會爲確定國是方針之最高權力機關。大會而不能確定一應急之外交方針。以昭告國民。則新政府建立以後之新猷。當亦可以推知。目前日人已準備在遼吉建立政府。　設立滿洲都督。關車軍司令部。且公開聲言謂「現在奉天吉林兩省已成自立之形體。脫離舊政權黑龍江亦改變其陣容。熱河省及内蒙古亦有響應。日軍部鑒於以上之情勢。乃特使其新政公明的發揮。</p>
<p>並緊密諸般之協調。完成治安之維持以謀民心之安寗。一而最近錦州方面。又日形緊急暴軍西迫。得寸進尺。總攻錦州即將於最近成爲事實新政府對此一嚴重之局面究如何應付。失地是否决心收回。暴軍西迫。是否决心抗禦。舊政府雖遷延敷衍但尙訴諸國聯冀以乞得外力之助。今大會何更不聲不響。若無其事。豈以意見之爭持。遂併此一迫在眉睫之緊急問題而忘之耶。此爲吾人所大感不解者也</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日之事。對外重於對内。對事重於對人。覆巢之下無完卵。我國今日雖巢尙未至覆。但勢已極危。黨國領袖。如仍不能從遠大處作想。徒斷斷於對内問題之爭持。則長夜漫漫。寗有旦時耶。</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>洪憲時代之袁項城。固一世之雄也。奈惑於六君子之勸進。乃毅然犯衆怒而稱帝之心動。然自知非借力於帝國主義者。不能收效。周自齊之奉使日本。雖饋以巨金。仍被拒絶。說者謂二十一條約。亦根於此。當項城稱帝之初。債製沉香寳座。細鏤九龍。嵌以巨珠。數逾百萬。宮中桌圓坑褥椅披。均向秋陳某緞局定製五爪九龍園花。曾付定洋一萬元。日夜加工趕造。比及工竣。而洪憲帝制。已如冰消雪散矣。緞局因之而閉歇。據傳喪失之資。達五萬金。事爲倭人所知。願以巨資購回。藏諸博物院。以留污點。緞局主人拒絶之。倭人懊喪而返。近聞該項五爪九龍桌圜椅披等。以三萬金售諸鐵道部。尊嚴燦爛之織錦。竟不爲倭奴所得。蓋亦差强人意者也。</p>

<h3>割讓臺灣時之邱菽園</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>臺灣之割讓與倭。此國恥史重大之一頁也。地在閩東。凡二十有九島。本屬我國版圖。明季爲荷蘭人所據。鄭成功逐荷人而有之。鄭氏亡。歸於清。不料甲午一役。喪師失地。訂約馬關。乃有割讓臺灣之條欵。顧臺灣人民·沐我國化澤殊深。志士奮臂起。謀所以抗倭。而邱菽園爲之魁。邱菽園。諱煒萲。本吾閩海澄人。</p>
<p>自先世遷臺灣。遂家焉。家資擁百萬。豪俠名於時。清廷割臺灣。菽園屢電力爭。復嚙血上書。清廷不之從。菽園慨憤異常。曰。朝廷旣棄臺灣土地人民矣。臺灣人民不可不有以自拔。即輸家財佐軍。組織臺灣民主國。并推舉唐景崧·劉永福爲正副總統。會撫標兵變。焚署刦庫。事敗。菽園不忍隸倭籍。於是内渡歸粤東。又曾流寓新嘉坡。自號星洲寓公。創設天南報館。旣而於海澄故居。築屋以養親。主講潮州韓山東山兩書院。更倡辦嶺東同文學堂。鼎革之際。菽園一度爲敎育部長。復被推爲粤代表。南北統一。被選爲參議員。旋病殁。時初元三月二十五日也。生平著述。有菽園贅談八種。後附庚寅偶存。壬辰冬興詩各一卷。中有和韻詠古。如伯夷云。不遇黄農遇夏朝。乾坤兄弟影寥寥。微言欲假清風送。湯武由來學舜堯。蘇武云。萬里關山月色闌。牧羝雪窖任荒寒。歸來不見生妻在。應悔胡中娶婦歡。楊雄云。非不文章千古重。竟將著述美新朝。九京欲起君相問。此恨如何作解嘲。洵有價值之什。讀其詩想見其人。爰誌之如此。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>結婚七十四年的夫婦　英國林肯歇埃Lincolnshire温弗利Wainfleet地方。有一位老者威廉華苟先生。Willliam　Walker他已結婚了七十四年。要算是英倫全國結婚最久的記錄了。他今年九十四歲。他的夫人是九十三歲。他們有一個兒子。今年已七十歲。這一門耆老。過着很快樂的生活。眞是大可羨慕的事。據華苟老先生對人說。「當我們倆結婚的時節。所有的資産是只有現金二鎊。屋中的家具。也只有一張牀。一張桌子和幾把椅子而已。那時我在帮人做田塲中的工作。每天可掙二個先令。但是我們盡力節省。稍事儲蓄。所以現在我們已可住着自有的屋子。又有些别的産業。銀行中也總算有些存欵了。」關於夫婦親愛之道。華苟夫人有一張很好的方子。可以介紹全世界的婦人。夫人說。「常常要使丈夫吃得好。並且無論如何。他要怎麽做。就讓他怎麽做。不必和他爭辯。這是唯一的方法。可使他心平氣和。而這也是夫婦生活中很關重要的事。」</p>
<h3>馬占山練軍之概况</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>馬占山將軍之部隊·都是一班年富力强的壯士。平日早五時起身。至晚間八時睡眠。一天中要受五遍操三次講堂之訓練。午夜更有緊急的集合。士兵每在沉酣的夢中。爲警笛聲驚醒。隨即躍起。在黑暗中將全副武裝穿戴齊整。還要把被褥疊好。然後在儲械室裏把自已的槍枝摸索到手。再到操塲上列隊。其中經過的時間。只有五分鐘而已。假使衣履不整。或是被褥散亂。或是槍械拿錯。都要受罰。</p>
<p>最使人受不了的。一種就是冬天的午夜集合。一種就是夏天的中午下操。前一種集合以後。就開始跑步。共經三十分鐘。士兵都已跑得汗流浹背。忽然立定訓話。也經過二三十分鐘之久。那時各士兵衣服上所流濕的汗液。在訓話時被寒風一吹。立刻凍成冰塊。等到散隊後換衣。那胸前和後背上的表皮。已被冰塊擦去。每日如此。後一種在極炎熱和夏季裏。每天中午要下一遍操。常在下操以後。各士兵衣服上。本來是灰色的。都要遮起一層白霜。就是汗液凝結而成的。</p>
<p>吃飯也有規定。每人每餐只能吃十二兩玉米飯。菜蔬呢·一連人合吃一鍋靑菜。裏面只放四兩豆油。其他早晨小菜。或是每人兩塊蘿蔔。或是每人一棵鹽漬靑菜。</p>
<p>還有一種打野外的訓練。常常一出去要到幾個月後才能回來。什麽乾糧等等。概不預備。所謂走到那裏。吃到那裏。</p>
<p>日常軍士概穿武裝。不准便服。更不准戴戒指等等奢侈的物品。最犯禁的。就是嫖賭二項。所以每天晚上必須宿營。倘使點名不應。即處重罰。</p>
<p>綜上所述。雖屬簡單的概况。然而也可以看出馬將軍練軍之精神了。試想受過這種嚴密訓練的軍人。豈有不奮勇强悍的道理。我很希望我們全國的軍隊都像這樣。那麽。怎會有滅亡之患呢。</p>
<h3>父母敎育</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>中華慈幼協濟會。以協助兒童幸福爲宗旨。係中美敎育家所合組。會長係孔祥煕部長。副會長二。羅運炎博士與郭秉文夫人。其他執行委員。均係中美兩國熱心慈善家。男女參半。不分國籍與性别。對於會務咸甚努力。總幹事吳維德精明强幹。故會務有蒸蒸日上之勢。前日開會。請現任工部局華人敎育處處長兼兒童敎育月刋主筆陳鶴琴敎授演講。籌成曾往參加。因陳君所述兒童敎育。主從父母敎育入手。確係治本之法。我輩年逾不惑。子女成行。對於此種主張。有採擇之必要。不敢自秘。爰將是日所聆要旨。摘錄如下。</p>
<p>兒童係父母所産生。欲講兒童敎育。應先注意父兒訓練。蓋父母敎育爲兒童訓練之先决問題、父母對於兒童發生之錯誤。由於視兒童爲己之財産。己之承繼人。因其未成人。目之曰小人。不認其有知識。故兒童與父母發生問題、以爲父母總不錯。其錯誤必在兒童。我國所以有「天下無不是的父母」之成語。父母之對於兒童。以本人之喜怒爲轉移。高興時將兒童玩弄。引之使笑。不高興時將兒童打駡。逼之使哭。甚至夫婦反目時將兒童出氣。不知兒童富於模倣性。父母之一舉一動。彼甚注意。故爲父母者。對於兒童敎育。應隨處留心。夫婦間如有不睦情事。即欲口角。亦應避去兒童之面。否則不良印象。入於兒童腦際。甚不相宜。又兒童生性活潑。自然好動。我國舊習。對於兒童往往禁止其遊戲。欲養成文質彬彬之態度。於敎育原理亦完全相反。最好爲父母者。對於兒童一切舉動。處於旁觀地位。不必處處存着兒童智識不完全。事事欲以一已之觀念監督帮助而横加干涉。蓋兒童有兒童之心理。應順其心理從小即養成其做事之習慣。此則爲父母者所當注意者也。</p>
<h3>德育與美育（下）</h3>
<p>— 方江水</p>
<p>然精神之修養若何。頗難言矣。昔英人斯賓塞爾著可知篇。未知篇。蓋吾生之初。渾渾噩噩。</p>
<p>來。吾不知其所自也。吾死之後。精神泯滅去。吾不知其所往也。此人生之謎。不可知也。</p>
<p>語云。人爲萬物之靈。言則人能知萬物之靈耳。所不知者。未始不有靈於人故吾於人格修養之方。亦有己知未知。不敢勇於自信也。</p>
<p>凡一學說之成立。英不各有綱領。故耶敎有耶敎之信條。回敎有回敎之信條。道釋等敎有道釋等敎之信條。精神之修養。亦有信條。雖然見仁見智。信條各有不同。日智仁勇可也。曰親愛精誠亦可也。吾於此曾三折肱焉。茲請縷述與諸君一商榷之。信條有五。</p>
<p>一曰遠大　語云。萬惡都生於見小。故欲成大事者。不能拘於小節。胸襟欲其大。眼光欲其遠。子貢云。賢者議其大者。不賢者識其小者。此大人與小人之所以有别也。</p>
<p>二曰超曠　超超脫也曠。曠達也。於名宜然。利亦猶然。古人謂三代以上。唯恐好名。一己之名。何必欲其垂之永久。甚且不惜矯揉造作。沽名釣譽。然身後之名。有何知焉。縱有簡册。知遇棄火。又將奈何。吾但知精神有所寄托。得名不以爲榮。失名不以爲憂。一聽之耳。至於物質上之營求。貪得無厭。尤爲無謂。社會之不安寗。皆由此而起。人之慾壑難塡。一生精力。爲此消磨盡凈。可憐孰甚。得相當之生活足矣。過分營求。徒勞何益哉。</p>
<p>三曰精勤　人生無論爲聖。爲賢。爲英雄。爲豪傑。即甚至爲小人。爲亂臣。爲賊子。無非精勤可得成功者。所謂業精於勤也。行路不勤。目的難達。飲食不勤。終朝不飽。可不勉哉。</p>
<p>四日篇實　人能誠實不欺。斯可得社會之信仰。此對人宜誠也。努力向學。孜孜不懈。可抵於有成。此對已宜誠也。昔人謂至誠所至。金石爲開。惟能篤實。然後百業可就。　　五日仁厚　人與人相接觸。斯生愛心。人人相愛。始得和平。孔子曰。仁者愛人。又曰。汎愛衆而親仁。故仁厚二字。乃維持社會之綢紀也。於人宜然。於物亦然。庶可免殘暴無人性之事件發生矣。</p>
<p>以上五者。極平常。極普通。人人可至。亦缺一不可。如五穀之於人生。得之則生。舍之則亡。人能於此加意修養。則高尙之思想。偉大之精神。純潔之人格。自可立致。有此等思想精神人格。無論爲文爲詩。爲書爲畫。推之爲其他一切。皆可臻乎妙乘。豈獨爲一美術家已哉。吾故曰。德育亦敎育之基礎也。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>戰！（下）</h3>
<p>— 王渭賓</p>
<p>我當時在王治平部下，我們奉令開到黄渡，」</p>
<p>「你畏縮麽」我問：丨故意地問，</p>
<p>「嗤！·······有什麽怕丨」</p>
<p>「你當時作何感想？」</p>
<p>「没甚感想，」</p>
<p>「不，我因爲要研究戰士心理的緣故，請你現在思索着當時的何種感觸，是何種料想？」我緊緊的追問：</p>
<p>他想了一回，回答「我覺得到一處奇特地方，倘然有接觸可能時，便認爲有意味，······所謂料想呢，覺得我自身已到要變動的地位。」</p>
<p>「你想到左近的同志們有離别的危險嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我們似乎整個的熱癢的熱忱，希望勝利上早見些顔色，我們在離車站不遠的戰壕裏很安閒，下棋，打麻雀，厚瓶洋酒，罐頭香烟食品，儘我們取樂，那時除軍令之外，一切都比平時平等多了。</p>
<p>他繼續着說：「那時我們打麻雀，用整塊的南腿煑熟了，用刀割着吃，聽外面槍聲，砲聲，近啦，咱們再可以打圈，斥候時常的濠前報信，電話的鈴聲是不斷的，槍聲近啦。「咱們出去「趕一下」罷」於是把牌合住，拿了傢伏，就趕一下，我記得八月十七那天，被蘇軍冲上了黄渡車站，可是這一下子，　是勝利，那王團長和李明城團長（就是河南的老洋人）他們倆很勇敢的當前衝禦的爲國犧牲了！」</p>
<p>可見這樣的中國軍隊，臨陣並没有生死的念頭，那一次中國戰事，不驚破了外人的胆，慢說日本小子，我們用五個人去拚死一個日本人，日本人死完，中國人還留着一半，還留存二萬萬同胞振興中國。</p>
<p>戰！是今日中華民族欲國自存的唯一出路！</p>

<p>紗市晨疲午堅、趨勢稍軟此因金融奇緊、實需未見暢達、又以年關催近、各帮更無興奮氣象、故市勢仍不脫暗淡之狀、惟蜀帮進量尙健、　　近期紗跌後即回　交易所人標前市開盤、以美棉停市、場中交易甚少、且本月份受金融打擊、跌一兩二錢　遠跌二·四五錢、午後本月獲利者抵空、漲一兩、遠漲三·四錢、全日成交統計一萬三千一百包、查賣出信誠一千九百五十包、森康四百五十包、買進吉豐九百包、天隆六百五十包、愼記六百五十包、大昶六百包、茲將人標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>近期棉突漲半兩餘</h3>
<p>棉市堅定本月份因寗波帮收貨、裝運甬地交解、標準突漲五錢半、遠期亦被帶起、但實銷各廠均無問訊之意此因外棉低廉之故、無再購本棉之必要、但漢帮及内地帮做多心思、異常濃厚始終拉緊、暫時難以看小也、</p>

<h3>美棉新年後可望轉機</h3>
<p>紐約廿四日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市稍堅、同業買進、足以吸收南方之套售、市面大勢照各方情形而論、均以新年將至而無把握、但有一種樂觀之潛勢、以爲最惡劣之時期已過新年中可以見其轉機　且世界中之棉貨、以過去二年中之銷路有限、行將告饋也、惟衆信當此空前壓力之後、欲求恢復其勢必緩、况棉價最後之依據、仍須視下季棉田之能否銳减也、同時冬季議會中、關於救濟農田之立法議案、尙未有把握、而新棉種植時期將至、南方之囤積運動、或將轉形軟化云、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>河下米市到稀銷活</p>
<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源忽然轉懈、約十數號浦存不弱、城鄉店銷實緣底薄已久、尙稱活碌、成交轉濃、厚新粳行情欲硬不易、蓋年關將屆、銀根緊迫所致、薄稻來貨日少、本街揀高稍動、市價又增角外、洋杜尖到接寥寥、夫胃轉活、形居挺秀、變陰元積貨尙有零銷仍細、酒胃不爽、價格又削五分、</p>
<p>新閘　到船三四十號、市銷因天時不佳、反而見旺、各方買意極濃、西新薄稻二種各提一角、洋杜尖隨到隨銷、形勢續挺統巾零胃靜爽、變陰二元酒戶胃口寥寥、故價回落數分、河下斛脚約四千石之譜、</p>
<h3>各帮續辦現小絞</h3>
<p>價漲一角</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因洋行節假、期米未開、回籠貨市價喴高、市上雖未成交、人心已爲望好、現貨銷路尙佳、因本街續有問津外、天津烟台等北洋帮與長江一路之漢口帮均有繼續試辦、行情立漲角許、統市成交小絞米三千包、價九元半、九元四角至九元三角云、</p>
<h3>本月期粉交割情形</h3>
<p>總額僅五萬九千包</p>
<p>大廠均於事前抽去</p>
<p>昨日爲十二月份期粉交割、全日之交割總額、聞共計五萬九千包、内計華豐之綠麥根二萬七千包、泰隆之綠騰球三萬二千包、福阜兩廠之粉均爲客帮事前抽去、餘若申大·信大·祥新等廠、亦因現銷甚佳、均無交割、年内幾日中、如客銷問津、當有現粉行市、否則照收盤標準爲準云</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>粗砂白市氣轉挺</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、仍乏到來、公會市場劃盤、因值週六、故交易殊寥但市氣均見挺秀、荷糖二十四號粗砂白喊價九兩六錢半、旋以九兩六錢、少數略有成交、出戶殊缺、綿荷白十一兩三錢、二十號中砂白九兩五錢半、磨細砂白九兩七錢二分半至五分、八號荷赤八兩三錢半、市形均屬穩秀、太古糖華新號開出ＣＷ嘜百餘包、價十一兩六錢半、劃盤Ｂ嘜十一兩七錢七分半至五分ＤＹ嘜喊十一兩七錢、尙少受手、ＨＸ嘜十一兩五錢半、進出兩懈、市象尙屬平穩</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>行將結束之呢絨市</p>
<p>時屆歲暮、呢絨交易漸轉冷落、公會市况、非常閑散、蓋賣買雙方均已次第結束收解、往年呢絨業、皆在廢暦年終爲大結束、今庚則提早收束、因大半遵行國暦　兼目前市面不靖、金融奇緊、故目下雖有零星交易、大半打票現交、否則用支票、絶少蓋回單之交易也、其對於先前之放賬、同業擬於本月底收付清償、然對於各錢莊者、則照市商會通告、即一月末日歸束之、一般洋服裁縫帮所放之賬、其勢亦非一月底、不能收齊、昨日星期六、同益會市塲上交易甚形寥落、貨價則有跌無漲　明暗盤相差甚鉅、實爲歷年來所罕見之紊亂、昨除各種什素嗶嘰外、其他如直貢·華特呢·花呢·巧克丁·麥爾登·雨衣布之類、無一不跌價求售、平厚呢與大衣呢、跌勢尤爲銳厲云、</p>
<h3>五金　到旺銷滯市趨疲象</h3>
<p>昨日五金市面、因出路不甚衆多、客帮胃口又呆、故市塲趨勢依然呈平庸局面、惟到貨極廣、所以行情頗有續疲之象、最近如平白鐵·馬口鐵·靑鉛·英鋼板·花園鉛絲·黑鐵皮等、無一不生意恐年内無大希望也、</p>
<h3>黑鐵皮昨到二三千擔</h3>
<p>風俏一時之黑鐵皮、其現貨據昨日消息、謂外棧新到二三千擔、係二六尺居多、三六尺則十二十三張居多、厚花色聞爲數有限云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　大批山西煤將到</h3>
<p>山西白煤、前因到貨稀少市價步漲、每噸自十九兩竟漲至二十一兩有奇、故本埠各行家、均向津採辦、茲悉最近將有七千餘噸裝來、昨接天津來訊云、已有三千五百噸裝出、不日即可到滬、如貨到齊、則市面可略有變動矣、</p>
<h3>雜訊　美棉七千包紐約運來、</h3>

<h3>故鄉</h3>
<p>— 火斤</p>
<p>無論誰如果聽到「故鄉」兩個字、總要緬懐著悠長的幽思、追戀着過去酣蜜的生活的情調、尤其是想到了慈母的問寒嘘暖、尺長寸短的柔藹、使一般做游子的人、覺得這種愛是無限的偉大、而一輩子都不能忘記的、調換個思路、感到慈親廣博的愛、終不能終身亨受著的時候、就要黯然凄楚了、所以在負笈千里求學、或遠托他主謀活的人們、丨假使那白髮蕭蕭的老母還存在著的話、那個不願意抓著一個空閒的時間、而回家一趟去享受那天性所流露的愛的温情、</p>
<p>最近我們底金小姐因爲要投到她慈懐母的胸裏去、得到母親底慰安的動念、所以就趁著學校停課數日的機會、飄然回鄉去了、尹小姐也到那省政府所在地的鎭江底故鄉去了、她是常去的、丨京滬車上、每月總有幾次發現她底倩影、　　我本人呢、說起來煞是可憐、畫一般美的故鄉、足足有三個年頭、没有和牠打照面了、在這個時際、眼巴巴地看見人家紛紛然地回去、怎不動情、因此我也要脚尖向著自己的故鄉踏著回去了、</p>
<p>然而我這次的返鄉、是去倒在慈親的懐裏、大笑一陣、或痛哭一場、去享取她底愛的薰渲、不、去領略故鄉優秀的風光、一湔我終日成年被埋没在塵囂的上海中的積污的腦筋麽、不、這都不是的、我底返鄉、最大的動機、是要回去慰問我違别三年而現在抱病呻吟在牀褥上的玉妹、</p>
<p>好了我的故鄉丨郡名呌做龍溪的、居然映在我的眼簾前面了、我的腦海中倐然盪漾起三年前的我底逗留在這裏的、一幕一幕的情况、復演的思潮、一層一層的往事、摺疊在我底心腔、哦、這時我底心境、是甜是苦、或是悲是喜、笨拙的我、始終不能從我底筆頭描畫出來、</p>
<p>玉妹從她底表情看起來、還是三年前的玉妹、丨雖然她已經結了婚、丨她仍有一副天眞爛漫的憨態、雖然她是病倒了、臉上還表現着俊俏可愛的神情、並没有帶點憔悴頽唐的病態、她家裏的人、都說她消瘦了、但據我底眼光來觀察、她並没有比她在孩子時代是有什麽較爲瘦削一點的象徵、這大概是她結婚後的初期、身體是曾胖了些的緣故吧、</p>
<p>玉妹的病、是起於生産産後、不到一月、她忽然害病起來了、病非小可、而是病得很厲害、她家裏的老太太們、都是偶像的崇拜者、甚麽抽籤問卜啦、延巫請神啦、閙了一個時間、别一方面、固然也延醫診治、等到我去到她底家裏的時候、她的病已經霍然了、不過她的右乳還生了乳癰、丨這是爲了幼時束胸的緣故、丨膿血凝着乳房、好像個腐的爛桃子、她在調換膏藥的時候、縐着雙眉、兀自焦急、她把那張硬膏藥從已爛壞的肌膚上揭下來、怎不使他疼痛難忍、而蹙眉呢、並且她還要把七八根藥綫打入爛肌裏、使人看了更覺害怕起來了、當時我就提出主張、換了藥散後、不要再貼膏藥、最好是用藥棉紗布象皮膏等的東西敷上、這樣可使她少受些痛苦、那知在這交通不便的鄉下　是有錢買不到這些東西的、就是這裏唯一規模很小的醫院裏、對這些東西是爲數有限的、出了重價也不能多買些出來、假使我早知道她是這個狼狽樣子的時候、我在上海早就購買了些帶來給她、丨在她這個乳廱上面、還未腐爛的乳盤、似乎成了彊塊的樣子、若是把手指輕輕地碰到那裏、她簡直痛得要大呌起來、而且每天到了傍晚的時候、乳頭旁就抽抽地作痛起來、更使她難受得可憐、</p>
<p>玉妹的他丨學盦君、是一個誠摰的靑年、雖然我僅初次和他會面、不過和他互通書信、是已有一年多了、從他底書信裏、就知道他是一個很好學的、具着熱腸的、前途有爲約靑年、他雖然生長於舊式縉紳的家庭裏、但是没有傳說着一些紈袴的氣味、他家裏開着門面與大的店舖、因他是個長子、家裏又乏壯年的人、所以就要呌在店裏照料、三一三十一、三七二十一的事了、因此没有給他出外上進求學的機會、反而很早就給他結了婚、但是他在平時有空閒的時候、總很起勁地看書閱報、自已鞭辟、所以他的學識和見解、在我的故鄉底靑年中、眞可說是佼佼者了、</p>
<p>他旣是個縉紳之裔、他的家庭、不消說、是個大家庭了、在這大家庭裏、有了什麽事、容易得到援助、是必然的現象、尤其是有誰生了病、那在富有經騐的太太、枝柏相連的叔姪姑嬸們、大家都具着熱忱、小心翼翼地服侍病、喂茶奉湯、言談排愁、這在簡單的小家庭裏、事事須假手於傭僕、是很難做到這樣的慰藉的、　　每個晚上、在吃晚餐之後、大家閒着没事、就都聚在玉妹安睡的房中、甚麽婆婆呀、嬸母呀、祖母呀、姑娘呀、小叔呀、濟濟一堂、有哭有笑的、好不熱閙、睡在牀上而口裏不絶地呻吟孤玉妹、在她高興起來的時候、也會有說有笑、因此而忘了痛苦、不過有時逢着她厭倦了、她就不耐煩地眼睛閉合着、假裝睡着的樣子了、她的耳朶、因爲病時吃了許多藥、身體虚弱、所以有些不聰了、但是如果在她身邊有了一片嘈雜的聲浪、她怎會不聽到而感覺厭煩呢、</p>
<p>玉妹雖然做了一個人底母親、却仍有些孩子氣、當好嚷着乳部發痛的時候、我便講些故事給她聽、她所最喜歡聽的是那些帶有神怪秘性的童話故事、當她聚精會神地聽到入神的時候、竟會手舞足蹈起來、而完全忘了她肉體上所有的痛苦、</p>
<p>再說玉妹底愛的結晶品、是一個不滿兩個月的女孩子、肌膚白晳、美麗可愛、兩目炯炯地視人、絲毫没有怕陌生人的狀態、她吃着乳媪的奶、但是玉妹每天至少都要要她抱在懐裏撫摩了幾回、雖然玉妹這場病是爲了這個小孩子而生的但她决不厭恨、她反而流露了天性的愛、施到這個小寳寳底身上、呵、母子之愛、是多麽的偉大啊、</p>
<p>玉妹自害病了、就完全没有吃過飯、每天祇是呷一口粥而已、我去的時候、正當她久病漸愈、病愈後的人、當然是很健飯的、稀飯是嫌它吃不飽的、所以她便嚷着要飯吃、但是她底婆嬸們、因她病後腸胃虚弱、恐怕没有什麽消化力、因此祇是仍舊給她粥吃、她便大發她底孩子氣、似</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>怒非怒地說「做乞丐的、向人家討飯、走了幾家、必定可以得到一些飯吃、但是我向你們乞憐了許多天的飯、你們始終不肯把飯給我吃、難道我連比乞丐都不似嗎、」說得大家忍不住都笑起來、後來經醫生的許可、才漸漸地給她點飯吃、</p>
<p>我在龍溪住了一星期、玉妹的病也慢慢地復原了、不過乳上流出的濃血、没有絶止、據醫生說「這個瘡癰要見到收口的功效、恐非短促時間能夠成功的、但是不會再起什起禍患了、」她乳部爲了這個爛癰的痛苦、也受夠了、唉可憐、</p>
<p>三年不見的故鄉、這次却發見兩件使我感到愉快的事、其一、現在的區長、是我們的女同胞、丨沈清泉是杭州人、丨我曾去拜訪過她、她底年紀約在三十歲左右、談吐不凡、是一位很幹練的人材、她在本年三月就任以來、裨益地方不淺、人民頌謳不置、大家都說「她比從前那貪污的區長、好得多了、」其二、是現在本地女子中學敎育、已經建設起來了、從前是一個鄉區、祇有幾個男女小學和私塾、現在却有一位謝光華女士、本鄉人、卒業於上海滬江大學、服務敎育界多年、學騐均優、她因鑒於本鄉敎育不發達、所以就毅然决然地回到龍溪來創辦了一個志成小學、編制是包含着小學和初中、但因本鄉風氣頑固、不得男女同學、所以祗收女生、因此讓那一般曾經卒業於小學的女生、可以有機會得受中學敎育了、可是本鄉底風氣、旣尙充滿着頑固的質素、一般經過了小學畢業的女生、往往就無心上進、而忙着趕製嫁家裳、不再升學了、所以這裏初中的學生、一共不過寥寥二十餘人、這不能不說是一個缺憾、</p>
<p>我在回滬的兩天前、一件不能忘情的事、是到已故的父母歸宿處上去掃墓、是前臨小溪、後栽桑竹、中間依稀的野草、生長着的凸出着、還不到三年歷史的一塊土中、睡着舍棄我這孤苦零仃的弱女的嚴慈的聖體、他倆的聲音丨笑貌、還縈繞着我記憶的腦裏、可是這時啊、儘我灑乾了傷心的淚泪、喊破了我焦燥的喉嚨、怎能起死人肉白骨而使歸天上的嚴慈復活起來、讓我再聆你倆底充着愛的呼聲、再親你倆慈福的顔面、我再投到你倆底懐抱中去、而受你倆底撫慰嗎、雙親去世了數載、我兀自浮沉在這個渺茫的人海裏、煢獨無依、悽苦無告、親愛的雙親呵、你如有知、看到你底弱女過着這樣孤苦的人生、你倆要怎麽的傷感呢、</p>

<h3>一方手絹</h3>
<p>— 姗君</p>
<p>老王、我們看女生打藍球去、怎樣、不、誰有這麽多的空閒去看她們打球、怪丢人的、胡似乎很不屑地的說、　　别這麽說呵、紅紅綠綠、嬝嬝嫋嫋、眞怪有意思的、何况、喂·小妹妹也在打呀、</p>
<p>眞的嗎、胡似乎有所動于衷了、</p>
<p>誰來騙你、</p>
<p>去、已是表示了莫大的和最後的决</p>
<p>心了、</p>
<p>於是乎大隊人馬、浩浩蕩蕩的直奔藍球塲殺來、</p>
<p>在這個時候、藍球塲上、只見紅褲綠衣的亂幌、鶯聲燕語的四射、尤其在每個男同學腦子裏亂幌四射的、自然是那個稚氣未脫的、我們平日都呼喊她做小妹妹的岑子、現在小妹妹三字、似乎已成功了她在我們學校裏的專門名詞了哩、這在我們這兩位老實人之稱的王和胡的、腦子中、當然也不能有個例外、小妹妹、小妹妹喲、</p>
<p>嗳、老王你瞧、小妹妹丢了一塊手絹下來了、你快去把它拾來、這不是一個接觸的開始嗎、千載難逢的機會喲、别給人家搶去了啊、老王、</p>
<p>没有意思、我不想有這種機會、我看、你别再這樣在我面前裝正經了、老老實實還是你趕快過去把它拾了過來交還她吧、你知道在這種塲合是無所用其客氣的、不然、就是别人的機會了、王這話、似乎有些刺在裏面、</p>
<p>這有什麽關係呢、在這種社交開放的社會裏、你說、我代她拾起了一方手絹、難道還有人會說我是有其他的野心嗎、這眞是太過下流了、</p>
<p>當然咯、誰能說這個話來、這眞是太不識時代、該吃耳光的混蛋了、嗳、你快去拾來呀、你瞧、這方手絹已給她們無情的鞋踏得不成個樣兒了、這該是多麽可惜的一回事呀、</p>
<p>哦、有這個事、唉、這眞是可惜、我必得把它拾來交還她喲、不然這眞是太可惜了、上帝啊、你賜給我些勇氣吧、胡說罷、似乎上帝眞的已賜給了他不少的勇氣了、他很神氣地移動着他的步履、但没起了幾步、又匆匆地帶着一個已漲紅得如猪肝樣的頭臉、走了回來、</p>
<p>咦、老胡、怎麽的啦、爲什麽走了幾步又縮回來了呢、</p>
<p>我很怕同學們看見了要呌起來、這可不是好受的、我想等大家散後去拾來、是比較好些、你看怎樣、</p>
<p>嘿嘿、······</p>
<p>你冷笑什麽呢、你敢譏笑我没有這能耐嗎、去、談也不要談、我準拾給你瞧、胡似乎是受了老王的莫大的侮辱了的憤怒起來了、於是他就不得不要在老王的面前、表示他眞的有决心和勇氣、</p>
<p>誰說你没能耐呢、不過一早就說要去拾的、要去拾的、但、一直到現在、快半個鐘頭了、還只見你說「非拾來不可、」「非拾來不可、」這才夠人「能耐」哩、</p>
<p>好、你等着瞧吧、</p>
<p>不久、天是漸漸地暗下來了、紅的綠的、也一個一個地溜進了房裏、閒人們、自然也各自拖着了　一個滿意後的笑聲、散去了、這正是我們光明正大的老實人丨胡、勇敢地開始他工作的時候、但曾幾何時、一秒鐘後、</p>
<p>啊、快逃、老王、手絹···雖已拾到、但丨但我的心裏、已是慌···慌···慌亂得在發抖了啊、</p>
<p>於是、在蒼然的暮色下、兩條黑影、似閃電般的疾馳而去、頗有些似小偷遇見了更夫般的情景、</p>

<p>Jinzhou: According to an official statement issued by the headquarters of the Chinese army here, Japanese troops clashed with a Chinese armored train in Tianzhuangtai, resulting in the Chinese armored train retreating eight li north towards Dawa. Yesterday, several Japanese aircraft were spotted near Dawa, dropping bombs around the Chinese armored train, causing slight damage to the engine. The bombs were quite powerful, leaving holes over six feet deep where they exploded.

<h3>Shenyang Japanese Army Headquarters</h3>
<p>Continues to Propagate Bandit Alarms</p>
<p>Fenghuangcheng Under Siege by Bandits</p>
<p>Talk of Stagnation in the Western Liaoning War</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army's plan to start attacking Jinzhou around Christmas has fortunately not materialized today. However, Japanese troops continue to fight bandits and unofficial armies in southern Liaoning. Based on various observations, it is feared that formal Chinese and Japanese armies will inevitably begin to clash at the beginning of the year. Today, the Japanese army headquarters continues to propagate bandit alarms and coercion by Chinese troops as excuses for using force, even claiming that formal Chinese troops have occupied Liaoyang, Shahe, Qianshan, Taogangzi, and Haicheng, all near Manchuria. These troops are said by the Japanese to be under the command of Huang Shizun, the Director of the Liaoning Public Security Bureau. They also propagate that Chinese troops on the Beining Railway are prepared to recover lost territories, awaiting only Zhang Xueliang's order, and that Rong Zhen is discussing this matter with Zhang Xueliang and others in Beiping. They also claim that 500 bandits attacked Gaolimen and Fenghuangcheng on the Anfeng Railway this morning, destroying telephone and telegraph lines, while 200 bandits attacked Sitaizi at the same time. Traffic on the Anfeng Railway is interrupted today. A trainload of soldiers each has been dispatched to the bandit alarm locations from Benxihu and Lianshanguan for reinforcements. The Fenghuangcheng train station is currently surrounded by bandits. Former Japanese Minister of the Army, Mr. Nan, arrived in Shenyang on Thursday, carrying a special mission and will soon inspect the war zone. A portion of the Qiqihar military aircraft has been ordered to come south, but the destination has not been announced. (National News Agency Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese army headquarters issued a public statement saying that at 12:30 AM this morning, the telegraph and telephone lines at a location 31 li northwest of Andong were cut. It was later heard that 500 bandits attacked Fenghuangcheng train station. A small squad of police and a team of local residents engaged the bandits in battle. Women and children took refuge in cellars and inside the station at the time. Other sources said that the bandits were eventually repelled. Upon hearing the alarm, the Japanese military authorities dispatched troops from Andong. It was also heard that two other train stations on the Anfeng Railway were also attacked by bandits, but details are unknown. (Reuters Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News from Seoul says that the Shenyang-Andong route has been repaired, and traffic between the two places has now resumed. According to the latest news from Manchuria, the Asahi Shimbun's claim of a destroyed bridge is far from the truth. The attackers numbered about a thousand, removed the rails from the bridge, burned thirty sleepers, and cut telephone and telegraph lines. Their purpose was to prevent the Japanese army from advancing towards Shenyang. News from Shenyang says that the attackers attacked Fenghuangcheng, where police and station personnel, along with volunteer corps, resisted fiercely and repelled them after two hours. It is heard that the enemy suffered several casualties, but the Japanese side only had one retired soldier killed in action. (Reuters Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun received a telegram from its special correspondent in Andong, stating that at 1:30 AM this morning, an 80-meter bridge and power lines near Fenghuangcheng were destroyed by Chinese, completely disrupting traffic between Shenyang and Andong. A machine gun team has been dispatched from Andong to the scene of the disturbance. A special train carrying an engineering repair team left for Fenghuangcheng at 4:00 AM this morning. (Reuters Dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to Japanese official sources, there is no war west of the Liao River because the actions of bandits in that area are difficult to ascertain. The official source mentioned the clash between Chinese and Japanese armored trains north of Tianzhuangtai, stating that the Japanese army advanced north and encountered a Chinese armored train carrying two field guns, which they repelled. When asked if the Chinese and Japanese armored trains were hindering the Japanese army's bandit suppression operations, as stated in General Honjo's declaration, the Japanese military personnel did not make a definitive statement, only saying that the Japanese army would eliminate any obstacles without hesitation. It was also said that the Shenxun Japanese army recently learned from plainclothes soldiers captured during bandit suppression that the former Chief of the Liaoning Provincial Police Department had sent personnel from Jinzhou with a large sum of money to recruit and reorganize bandits west of the Liao River to hinder the Japanese army's operations. According to unofficial sources, a Japanese troop that went from Yingkou to Tianzhuangtai has now returned to Yingkou, and the Japanese troops occupying Niuzhuang have also withdrawn to Yingkou. The cessation of Japanese military bandit suppression operations on the west bank of the Liao River coincided with the news of warnings from several major powers to the Japanese government, which is noteworthy. It is noted that the Liao River is approximately 60 miles from Jinzhou. (Reuters Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<h3>Yano Urges Zhang to Withdraw Troops</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Japanese official sources deny that the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in Beiping was ordered to issue a final warning to Zhang Xueliang, they admit that Yano had a conversation with Zhang yesterday. It is heard that Yano is still trying hard to persuade Zhang to voluntarily withdraw troops, otherwise conflict will be inevitable. Japanese official sources express concern about the notes from Britain, the United States, and France to Japan, clearly stating that if the powers only express their concern about the spread of the turmoil within the customs area, the Japanese government would not be so resentful. If the powers do so, Japan will immediately issue a promise to limit the Japanese army's actions to Manchuria. However, it must be understood that Japan cannot allow a third party to interfere in any actions that Japan deems necessary to restore peace and order in Manchuria.

However, after the reply is sent out, a lengthy statement will be published explaining Japan's position. The letters from Britain, the United States, and France are not identical, so the replies will also differ.

However, when the British, American, and French ambassadors go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to collect the replies, diplomatic authorities will read and explain the statement to them.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Internal and External Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the sudden turn of the political situation, both the leaders of the Party and the State and the people of the country have shown joy. One reason is the belief that the political situation will now be determined by ourselves, offering more opportunities to express our aspirations. Another reason is the belief that with the emergency of external troubles, there is now hope for a united front against external aggression and a common effort to overcome national difficulties. We know that these two different psychological states are a major contradiction at present. If the Party and government leaders still cannot sincerely repent and work together to relieve the national crisis, the new government will still not be able to satisfy the people's expectations, and the future of the political situation is still not optimistic. Therefore, it has been solemnly urged to the new government to show its newness substantively, and not just celebrate its newness in terms of form and individual success.</p>
<p>Today, it is urgent to solve domestic problems, and even more urgent to resist the powerful enemy and recover lost territories. If all levels of our country can sincerely cooperate based on the welfare of the country and the people, then all domestic problems can be solved easily and will not become any thorny issues. The powerful enemy occupies half of our country and is now displaying its ambitions, pressing forward step by step, placing our country and nation on the line of life and death. This is the most serious and pressing problem facing our country. How to effectively resist it is also extremely urgent and brooks no delay. Moreover, we firmly believe that only by uniting against external aggression can we solve various domestic contradictions. If we constantly dispute over domestic issues, the disputes will never end, and the problems will never be solved. Whether or not we can unite against external aggression is a measure of the ability of Party and government leaders to unite sincerely, and it is also the key to whether the new government can win the support of the people and establish its foundation.</p>
<p>However, based on the current situation, we cannot help but feel disappointed. Since the opening of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, all eyes have been focused on the hope that the congress will quickly determine foreign policy and issue it to the country, so that the people can devote themselves to the country under a unified policy and united action in order to save the country and themselves. However, the congress has been open for nearly a week, and the issues debated are the reform of the political system, the consultation of candidates for chairman, presidents, and various departments. The rivalry between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is still present and has not been eliminated. There has been no discussion of the urgent foreign policy issues. According to the disclosure in the newspaper a few days ago, it is clearly stated that there is no solution to diplomacy and party affairs. If that is the case, we cannot but recognize that the new government has already stepped into the past. The new government still has no determination to face the current national crisis together. The difference between the new government and the old government is only the reform of the system and the change of personnel, the form is different but the essence is no different. The First Plenary Session is the highest authority to determine the national policy. If the congress cannot determine an emergency foreign policy to announce to the people, then the new initiatives of the new government after its establishment can also be inferred. Currently, the Japanese are preparing to establish a government in Liaoning and Jilin, establish the Manchuria Governor-General and the Guandong Army Command, and openly declare that "the two provinces of Fengtian and Jilin have now become independent entities, separating from the old regime, and Heilongjiang has also changed its lineup. The provinces of Jehol and Inner Mongolia have also responded. The Japanese military department, in view of the above situation, has specially developed its new policies publicly, and closely coordinated various aspects to complete the maintenance of security in order to seek peace of mind for the people." More recently, the situation in Jinzhou has become increasingly urgent, with the violent army pressing westward, gaining an inch and seeking a foot. A full-scale attack on Jinzhou will soon become a reality. How will the new government respond to this serious situation? Is it determined to recover the lost territories? Is it determined to resist the violent army pressing westward? Although the old government procrastinated and evaded, it still appealed to the League of Nations in the hope of seeking foreign aid. Why is the current congress silent and as if nothing had happened? Could it be that due to the disputes over opinions, this urgent issue is forgotten? This is what we cannot understand.</p>
<p>We believe that today, external affairs are more important than internal affairs, and matters are more important than people. Under a toppled nest, there are no intact eggs. Although our country's nest has not yet been toppled today, the situation is extremely dangerous. The leaders of the Party and the State must still be able to think from a long-term perspective and not just be stuck in disputes over internal issues. Then, how long will the long night last?</p>

The Training Department was abolished, and a Mass Movement Guidance Committee was established instead.</p>
<p>(4) Committee Member He Xiangning and Committee Member Wang Qi proposed the implementation of a conscription system. The principle was approved, and the implementation period and methods were handed over to the National Government for proper planning.</p>
<p>(5) Committee Member Zhao Pilian proposed guaranteeing 1. active-duty military personnel and 2. service education personnel. Resolutions: 1. Passed and sent to the National Government to be handled properly by the competent authorities. 2. Sent to the National Government for reference.</p>
<p>(6) Recommended four committee members, Chen Gongbo, Ye Chucang, Deng Jiayan, and Luo Jialun, to draft a declaration for the plenary session. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today's fourth plenary session of the conference, held as usual at 8:30 a.m., discussed an important telegram from Zhang Xueliang, detailing the Japanese army's threat to Jinzhou and the steadfast defense of the troops stationed there, and requesting final instructions on strategy and requesting supplies. The commissioners all felt that the case should be handled by the current National Government which had not yet been handed over. Then, the conference discussed the agenda. Due to Sun and Li's departure to Shanghai last night, and fewer commissioners arriving today, the voting scheduled for today and the agenda for tomorrow and the day after were all withdrawn and cancelled. The secretariat will organize and reissue them after referring to the facts. Therefore, the date for voting for the Chairman, Commissioners, and Presidents of the National Government could not be discussed today. As for foreign policy, it cannot be decided immediately, because all measures must be implemented, and before the government is formed, any resolutions submitted to the National Government for execution or review would be empty talk and not realistic. Therefore, the commissioners did not discuss foreign affairs or Wang's national salvation meeting in advance, but waited until the government was formed to vote and then hand it over to the new government to take responsibility for implementation. Therefore, the commissioners' energy at the meeting these days was not as high as in private negotiations regarding the selection of government personnel. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The term of the First Plenary Session was scheduled to end on the 26th, but the discussion of various proposals has not yet been completed, and the Chairman of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan have not yet been elected. It has been decided to extend the meeting by one day, and the fourth meeting will be held at noon on the 28th. After all matters are completed, a closing ceremony will be held immediately.

The conference will rest for one day on Sunday, the 27th. On the 28th, it is expected that the President of the National Government and the President of the Five Yuan will be voted on, and then the declaration of the conference will be published and the meeting will be closed. As for the candidate for the President of the National Government, there is now a saying that Yu Youren will be appointed. There is also a saying that Ju Zheng will be appointed as the President of the Examination Yuan.

<p>The Process of Verbal Disputes</p>
<p>Chen and Zou Come to Shanghai to Urge Sun to Return to Beijing</p>
<p>Wu Jingheng Is Willing to Accept Warnings</p>
<p>But Claims He Will Not Change His Views</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Wu Jingheng's own account, his speech yesterday was his personal opinion and did not represent the overall opinion of the Beijing side. He has not changed his views so far. If the meeting wants to warn him, he will accept it, but he hopes that the meeting will not only attack the Beijing side, then he will not demand that those who sold out the country by colluding with Japan be held responsible. Because the resolutions of the Shanghai meeting were a compromise of mutual concessions, not a conquest of the Beijing side, and not a public trial of the Beijing Commissioners. If only the Beijing side is held responsible, it would be very unfair. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The situation of the discussion and disputes in yesterday's meeting was reported in brief yesterday and can be seen in today's newspaper. Today, a certain committee member, who was involved in the matter, talked about the truth at the time, which was even more thorough than the rumors. He said that yesterday, a certain Guangdong commissioner proposed a motion to punish Zhang Xueliang, speaking eloquently and incessantly, saying that not only should Zhang be held responsible for losing the battle and losing territory, but the Nanjing government should also bear major responsibility. After the report, Wu Jingheng immediately stood up and said that Zhang Xueliang should be responsible, and the Nanjing government should also be responsible for non-resistance, and those who went to Japan to collude with Japan to bring disaster to China must also be held responsible. A certain Guangdong commissioner stood up and questioned what Wu meant by "those who sold out the country." Wu replied that those involved should know. At that time, some people shouted "right, right, right," and others shouted "tsk, tsk, tsk." This is one incident. Also, in the amendment to the Organic Law of the National Government, Wu also stood up to express his opinion, saying that the President of the Executive Yuan is the de facto responsible cabinet, and the standard for selecting the person should be someone with methods. If he only seeks vain reputation and has no methods, then changing the system will not help in practice. We must not blindly follow suit. Please pay attention. The Guangdong commissioners felt that Wu's words seemed to have some implications, and they were even more dissatisfied. Therefore, some people suggested that Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Fu Bingchang should leave first to show their coldness, and demanded that Wu be warned not to make such remarks that would undermine cooperation in the future, so as to create room for maneuver. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After today's meeting, regarding Sun Ke and others' departure to Shanghai, one side blamed Wu Jingheng for talking too much, and the other side blamed Sun Ke for being rash, saying that it was contrary to the spirit of cooperation originally agreed upon at the peace conference. It was decided to send Chen Mingshu and Zou Lu to Shanghai to persuade Sun to return as soon as possible. On the one hand, a certain commissioner from the Beijing side admitted to persuading Wu Jingheng not to attend the next meeting, and it is expected that Sun Ke can return, because in recent off-site negotiations, the facts of various issues are not very different from Sun's expectations. Sun should not give up this accomplished situation. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and other commissioners suddenly left Beijing for Shanghai. Chen Mingshu and Zou Lu took a fast train to Shanghai at noon on the 26th to report to Sun, Li, and others that everyone hopes to return to the capital as soon as possible to discuss important matters together. Chen and Zou will take this opportunity to inquire about Wang Jingwei's condition and urge the commissioners Li Jishen and Li Zongren, who recently came to Shanghai from Guangdong, to go to Beijing as soon as possible. Chen and Zou are scheduled to return to Beijing on the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Mingshu went to Shanghai in the afternoon of the 26th to contact Wang, Sun, and other Central Commissioners in Shanghai and urged them to go to Beijing to attend the meeting. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin said that Wu and Sun had verbal disputes, and Sun Zhesheng and Li Junpei had gone to Shanghai. Jiang Zuobin went to Shanghai that night to welcome and persuade them. I think Sun and Li will definitely value the ardent hope of the colleagues at the conference and will not disregard the national crisis due to trivial matters. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Central Commissioner Sun Ke took a train to Shanghai on the evening of the 25th, the First Plenary Session successively sent personnel to Shanghai to welcome him.

<p>Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Czech Representative to Russia</h3>
<p>Conspired to Assassinate Hirota</p>
<p>Aimed to Incite a Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>Warnerck Recalled to Prague</p>
<p>Prague, 26th National News Agency Dispatch: The Associated Press learned today that Warnerck, the secretary of the Czechoslovakian representative in Russia, was in fact instructed by Soviet Russia to conspire to assassinate the Japanese ambassador and demand the withdrawal of diplomatic personnel from the country. Mr. Warnerck is only 35 years old and is known as a military expert among several major European powers. The Soviet Secret Police accused him of plotting to incite Russians to assassinate Japanese Ambassador Hirota in an attempt to escalate the Sino-Japanese Liaoning Incident into a Russo-Japanese war. Mr. Warnerck has now been recalled to Prague at the request of the Russian government. However, the Czech authorities still deny this, claiming that Mr. Warnerck was recalled due to illness. However, according to the Associated Press, Mr. Warnerck was indeed recalled at the request of Soviet Russia and has already departed from Moscow and is expected to arrive in Prague on Monday. According to sources in Moscow, when Russian diplomats reported Warnerck's conspiracy to the Czech representative in Russia, Mr. Guo Xianke, Mr. Guo initially did not believe it, saying that none of his staff would be able to hide their private political actions from him. However, Mr. Guo then agreed to send Warnerck back to his country immediately. On Friday, Mr. Guo telephoned the Japanese Embassy and informed them that Warnerck had left for Prague due to illness. However, it is heard that Mr. Warnerck actually left Moscow today. Although Czechoslovakia has not formally recognized Soviet Russia, it has sent a diplomatic representative to Moscow, who enjoys full diplomatic privileges. However, its representatives are often chosen outside of political considerations. Therefore, when correspondents from Moscow newspapers heard about this conspiracy, although they speculated about the mastermind, few expected it to be within the Czech delegation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th National News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese government has now clearly stated that the discovery of the conspiracy to assassinate Japanese Ambassador Hirota in Moscow should not cause international disputes, and declared that the incident has been resolved locally in Moscow. The Japanese government therefore intends to express its gratitude to the Soviet Russian police for this matter. According to reports, the conspiracy was hatched by a certain embassy official, Mr. A, who planned to shoot the Japanese ambassador in order to provoke a war between Japan and Russia. The embassy official also discussed this matter with a close friend, a Russian, Mr. B, and strongly encouraged him to take on the task. Mr. B then reported the information to the police. Furthermore, a telegram from the Czech capital stated that a certain official of the Czech diplomatic mission in Moscow has now been recalled by his country, presumably in connection with this matter.</p>
<h3>Philippines</h3>
<p>Restricting Immigration</p>
<p>Chinese Most Affected</p>
<p>Manila, 26th Reuters Dispatch: The Philippine government will reduce the number of ports of entry for foreigners in order to prevent them from entering the country illegally, which will affect the Chinese the most. Acting Governor Butter has ordered an investigation into the illegal entry of Chinese into the Philippine Islands. Two cabinet members have gone south to conduct this investigation, as many Chinese enter through ports in the south. The cabinet members have discussed two methods to deal with this matter: one is to reduce the number of ports of entry for immigrants, and in the future, only Manila will be the legal port of entry; the other is to establish special investigation bureaus at all ports of entry for foreigners to strictly monitor foreigners entering the country. The Chinese Consul General in Manila is now willing to cooperate with the Philippine government to reduce the number of Chinese who illegally enter the Philippines by starting with an investigation of the household registration of overseas Chinese on various islands. Qualified overseas residents will be issued special certificates. This cooperation has been welcomed by the Philippine immigration authorities.</p>

<h3>Closing of the Russian Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Approved Various Figures</p>
<p>Economy to Overwhelm the World</p>
<p>No Illiterates in Russia in Five Years</p>
<p>Stalin's Bold Statement</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th Havas Dispatch: The Soviet Central Executive Committee held its final meeting. Chairman Molotov of the Council of People's Commissars delivered a closing speech. The audience listened attentively. The gist was that the various figures for 1932, after being verified by the supervisory authorities and submitted to the Council of People's Commissars, have been approved by the Executive Committee. This shows that the economic construction plan for next year has been formally established, and the hydroelectric power plant under construction has historical value. Molotov then described the most important factories that should be opened next year, especially the Gugerske Factory, the Manitogorsk Factory, the Glisalok Factory, and the Svie Power Plant. The Soviet government intends to make every effort to improve the food supply for the working class. Ninety-two food factories will begin operations, including 18 flour mills, 12 meat processing plants, 2 refineries (sugar and kerosene), and 23 canneries. Molotov concluded by saying that the Soviet people have the full will to implement the Five-Year Plan. We do not need to discuss foreign policy much, because the Soviet government's peace policy and its actions based on this policy are very obvious and do not need explanation. Molotov also compared the funds needed by the United States to relieve the panic with the situation of the Soviet economic recovery, and said that the Soviet social organization is extremely great, and rumors from outside are therefore spreading. We can ignore this kind of instigation, but we only seek to complete the 1932 plan and pay close attention to ensuring that our claims can overcome everything. After Molotov's speech, Cherjingyakov, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, presented a resolution approving the domestic and foreign affairs of the Soviet Union and the various figures for 1932 after being verified by the supervisory authorities, which was unanimously passed.</p>
<p>Moscow News: The most noteworthy event at the recent plenary session of the Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee was the report on economic development. Chairman Stalin delivered his proud oratory, claiming that after the success of the Five-Year Plan, Soviet Russia would definitely be able to overwhelm capitalist countries around the world economically. The results of the Five-Year Plan reported at the conference are as follows: (1) In the past four years, the cultivated land has increased from 1,522,500 acres to 2,500,000 acres, and will increase to 3,100,000 acres next year. (2) The most rapid development in industry is timber and fishery products. The current Soviet Russian timber and fisheries industry has surpassed any country in the world. (3) The cultural development of uncivilized areas in border regions is also quite impressive. According to this year's survey, the number of illiterate people has decreased by more than 35% compared to before the European War. In the next five years, there will be no one illiterate in the entire Russian territory. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Christmas Eve Gloom</h3>
<p>Paris Unemployed Workers Demonstrate</p>
<p>Chilean Communists Attack Barracks</p>
<p>Paris, 25th Havas Dispatch: Christmas Eve suppers were slightly subdued due to the impact of the economic panic. Although restaurants reduced prices and dishes, there were fewer customers than in previous years. The weather was cold that day, with rain and snow at night. The midnight Mass in churches was very crowded, and the theaters were also full. The Latin Quarter and Montparnasse, belonging to the academic and artistic circles, were especially lively. The Montmartre entertainment district only began celebrating at midnight, following the old traditions. Organizations for the poor's suppers increased as a result of the economic panic compared to previous years. Thousands of beggars were provided with food by the Salvation Army, and Boy Scouts distributed meat, bread, and soup at the door, so there were many disappointed people. The newspapers belonging to the Communist Party called on unemployed workers to demonstrate in front of various supper restaurants. Nine unemployed workers demonstrating in Montmartre were carrying military equipment and were arrested by the police. There were also demonstrations by unemployed workers near the Presidential Palace and Montparnasse.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Ceases Attack on Jinzhou</p>
<p>Shenyang, 25th, Da Mei Evening News: Whether General Honjo of the Japanese Army's second military operation west of the South Manchurian Railway Line intends to attack Jinzhou or merely suppress bandits is unknown to outsiders. However, the operation appears to have been abruptly halted. The suddenness and strangeness of the halt is no different from the sudden withdrawal of troops advancing towards Jinzhou in November. The true situation at this time is still unclear, but the so-called bandit suppression military operation west of the South Manchurian Railway and north of Shenyang, which was launched with a mixed brigade and three large battalions, only found 300 of those designated as irregular troops, killed 100 of them, and then stopped abruptly. Prior to this, the Japanese Army Headquarters claimed that there were 15,000 soldiers and bandits in the area, endangering Japanese communication lines. As for the troops sent to the area south of Shenyang and west of the South Manchurian Railway, it is now announced that they have actually all returned to their bases. The only result of this action is the occupation of the towns of Tianzhuangtai and Niuzhuang. The Japanese Army Headquarters is still silent about the battle of Tianzhuangtai. However, according to reports here, Japanese troops set out from Yingkou and crossed the Liao River on the second day. They were actually surrounded by Chinese troops, who used artillery to break the ice on the Liao River to prevent the Japanese from sending reinforcements. After a long time, the Japanese army brought in artillery, and used artillery fire to force the Chinese artillery to retreat, so that they could send troops across the river to reinforce the besieged Japanese soldiers. Later, Japanese armored vehicles advanced to the northwest and encountered Chinese armored vehicles. The Chinese armored vehicles had two field guns, so they opened fire on each other. However, the Chinese army eventually retreated towards Dawa due to its isolated position. The Japanese army occupied Tianzhuangtai, and then advanced further, but at this time they received an order to retreat. As for the Japanese military communique here, it only stated that the Chinese soldiers suffered heavy casualties, without saying anything else. Furthermore, it is reliably reported tonight that the Japanese army has stopped advancing and is currently scouting the location of what they call bandits and irregular troops. When reporters asked whether General Honjo considered the engagement of Chinese regular troops on the Yingkou Line a pretext to start an attack on Jinzhou, the spokesman for the Japanese Army Headquarters avoided answering and only described various bandit alarms in detail.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>Suzuki Brigade Dispatched to Liaoning</p>
<p>Atrocities of Japanese Troops in the City</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, Qiqihar News: On November 19th, Japanese troops, the Second Division led by General Tamon, consisting of approximately 3,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, entered the city. On November 28th, the said division withdrew from Heilongjiang, leaving only the Nagatani Brigade stationed, numbering approximately two to three hundred. On December 2nd, the Suzuki Tsūmi Division arrived in Heilongjiang, numbering approximately one thousand. Subsequently, the majority of them withdrew the day before yesterday. Currently, the Japanese troops stationed in Heilongjiang number no more than five to six hundred, including the aviation unit. The locations where Japanese troops are currently stationed are as follows: the aviation unit is stationed at the Jiaotong Middle School and Normal School, and the airfield (under construction since November 25th) is west of the Normal School, only about two li away from the provincial capital, with a strength of no more than one hundred. The communication unit is stationed at the First Primary School in front of the Chamber of Commerce. The military police are stationed in the front courtyard of the clothing factory. The cavalry is stationed at the Jiangwutang, numbering less than two hundred and fifty. The artillery is stationed at the Longjiang Station, numbering less than one hundred. Other infantry are scattered in the Japanese Consulate, the South Manchuria Railway Company office, and the South Barracks, appearing intermittently. The headquarters is located inside the South Manchuria Railway Company office. The actual strength of the Japanese troops includes six aircraft, only one of which is a monoplane, two armored vehicles, one searchlight vehicle, no more than ten flat-trajectory guns, an unspecified number of machine guns, and several military vehicles. Tanks have not been seen.</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft fly daily from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, dropping bombs as a show of force along the river and occasionally strafing with machine guns, claiming it is practice. The infantry, cavalry, and artillery sometimes parade in formation and sometimes conduct live-fire exercises in the suburbs. In short, although their numbers are not large, they make a show of strength by marching through the streets and alleys to intimidate our people. During this time of frantic activity, the Japanese troops also take time for inspections. Those inspected include the residence of Zhai Xiren, the Zhang residence (the home of Wan's father-in-law), and the Zhang Mingjiu residence, which were inspected twice. The first inspection took place on November 24th, and the second on the 6th of this month. The first inspection yielded nothing. The second inspection found five hundred rounds of ammunition, four machine guns, and more than twenty rifles. It is also rumored that unauthorized Japanese soldiers have broken into other civilian residences. Since the Japanese troops entered the city, bandits have sprung up in the countryside, and many villagers have come to the city to avoid the bandit threat. However, they know that the city is also disturbed several times a night, so they can only reside temporarily after entering the city. The order in the city is maintained by the Public Security Bureau and the Special Zone Garrison, so it is still considered relatively peaceful. The merchants have gradually resumed business since the day after the Japanese troops entered the city. The Japanese troops, fearing the cold, often suffer from chapped hands and cracked feet. A certain photo studio has photos of Japanese soldiers' frozen hands and feet. According to the studio, there are a total of fourteen types, with eight prints of each type being developed for mailing to Japan. These photos were taken the day after the Japanese troops occupied Heilongjiang. According to the Japanese, the frostbite occurred during the fighting with the Heilongjiang army in Daxing. The chapped hands and cracked feet in the photos are truly unsightly, with the diameter of the frozen fingers and toes being about one inch. It can be seen that the Japanese troops are not able to withstand the cold. Furthermore, the Japanese troops, hearing rumors of a counterattack by Ma Zhanshan, are constantly on guard. At night, sentries are stationed at the South Manchuria Railway Company office and other places. Whenever General Ma is mentioned, they cannot help but turn pale.</p>
<p>Someone who returned from Heilongjiang yesterday said that the Japanese troops recently conducted a very thorough search of various merchants in Heilongjiang Province. Those who have military supplies will immediately be accused of collaborating with the enemy and their officers will be arrested. A certain military clothing store on West Street had two thousand sets of gray military uniforms in stock, which were made for a certain brigade before the Heilongjiang Incident but had not been taken away before the retreat. The Japanese troops found them, poured kerosene on them in the street, and burned them. The storefronts of nearby stores were mostly damaged by the flames. Because the Japanese troops were monitoring the scene, even those who were affected dared not try to put out the fire with all their might, so three or four families were implicated. The shopkeeper of the military clothing store was taken away and has not yet been released. It is also said that the Longjiang Hotel, the largest in Heilongjiang, has been searched under the pretext that Chinese military officers resided in the hotel. However, they did not find anything. The evening before last (the 16th), three Japanese and two Chinese who were pro-Japanese led more than ten Japanese military police to occupy the hotel. Because the owner, Li Zhendong, was not in Harbin, the Japanese arrested the clerks Yang Ruifeng, Liu Jinglin, and Le Zhenzhi and took them to the Japanese military police headquarters. It is heard that Li Zhendong believes that the hotel is self-operated by merchants, and it is not known on what basis the Japanese forcibly took over it. Yesterday, a petition document was drafted in Harbin, requesting the Heilongjiang local maintenance association to negotiate with the Japanese side. (Evening of the 19th)</p>
<h3>Zang Shiyi's Acceptance of a Puppet Position</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: After Puyi was abducted to Shenyang by Itagaki, the "Manchu-Mongol Puppet Dynasty" was not immediately realized due to the Japanese government's uncertain policy. The intention of the Minister of the Army, Minami, was to disregard everything and immediately establish a Manchu-Mongol Political Committee, with personnel from the Army, Foreign Affairs, and Colonial Affairs Ministries, as well as the president of the South Manchuria Railway Company and the commander of the Kwantung Army, as the core personnel to carry out governance. However, Foreign Minister Shidehara, considering diplomatic issues, was not quite convinced and advocated for a gradual approach, first supporting a puppet to the stage, with Japan avoiding direct control and then annexing it after some years. This plan was the focus of debate between the military and diplomatic factions in the Japanese government before the previous cabinet collapsed, and it remained unresolved. Although the recent reorganization of the Japanese cabinet was caused by the military faction's criticism of the previous cabinet's weak policy towards China, the plan to establish a new Manchu-Mongol regime seems to have not changed. The Japanese still want to use a puppet as a transition before annexation. However, looking around among the Chinese traitors in Shenyang, people like Yuan Jinkai were not enough to rally everyone. After much hesitation, they turned their attention to Zang Shiyi, the former chairman. On the 15th of this month, hundreds of representatives from commercial and industrial groups in Shenyang, under the command of Japanese military personnel, held a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, resolving to ask the local maintenance committee to voluntarily disband and publicly nominate Zang Shiyi as the governor of the province to organize a formal government. After the meeting, the Japanese military police forced each merchant and civilian family to send one person, holding banners with the words "The gentry, merchants, farmers, and workers of the entire Fengtian city publicly support Zang Gong as the ninth governor of the province" and other words, led by Yuan Jinkai and others to Zang's residence to persuade him to take office. Zang was initially hesitant, but after much persuasion, he reluctantly agreed. On the afternoon of the 16th, the local maintenance committee held a ceremony in the provincial governor's office to hand over power. Yuan Jinkai gave a speech, and Zang Shiyi responded. From the 18th, Zang began to work in the puppet provincial office, with several Japanese advisors accompanying him in and out to secretly monitor him. Zang also set the office hours from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM, and the visiting hours from 12:00 PM to 2:30 PM. Currently, all personnel from the old maintenance committee have been dismissed. Yuan Jinkai has been hired as an advisor to the puppet provincial office. Weng En-yu, who was the Director of Finance in the maintenance committee era, and Gao Yuheng, the Director of Industry, have both resigned. Zhao Pengdi has been appointed as the puppet Director of Finance, and Liang Yushu has been appointed as the puppet Director of Industry. The Municipal Affairs Office has been renamed the Municipal Affairs Department, expanding its powers to manage the municipal affairs of the entire city of Shenyang, with Zhao Xinbo still serving as the mayor. All of Zhao's concurrent positions have not been changed to reward his labor. Zhao is trusted by the Japanese, and Zang's rise to power this time was also orchestrated by him. (December 20th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Students to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Resolved to Petition the Government on Seven Points</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the Guangzhou students held a large petition on the 17th of this month, they resolved on the same day to organize a national salvation petition group to prepare to go to Nanjing to carry out a large-scale petition. On that day, Xiang Hanping, the representative of the Guangdong government, promised that the Guangdong government would allocate travel expenses. Therefore, the students of the entire city have been preparing for days to elect representatives for the trip north and have agreed to elect three representatives from each school and request the Guangdong government to allocate 300 silver dollars in travel expenses per person, with the intention to set off north on the 21st.</p>
<p>At the same time, the following demands were resolved to be made to the Nanjing government: (A) Request the government to allow the Guangdong army to pass through and recover the lost territories in the Northeast. (B) Request the government to simultaneously send troops to recover the lost territories. (C) Request the government to dismiss and investigate Zhang Xueliang, who neglected his duty in defending the territory, and permanently deprive him of his civil rights. (D) Request the government to dismiss and investigate the military police who shot students participating in patriotic movements, and allow absolute freedom for patriotic movements in the future. (E) Request the government to make diplomacy and finance absolutely transparent. (F) Request the government not to directly negotiate with Japan before Japan withdraws its troops. (G) The Guangzhou Student Anti-Japanese Movement Joint Association requests the Guangdong government to guarantee in writing that the Guangdong army will send troops solely to recover the lost territories and will not have other uses. After the above proposals were agreed upon, each school has been separately selecting representatives for days, with a total of more than two hundred representatives being elected. They immediately requested the Guangdong government to fulfill its promise and issue more than 70,000 yuan in travel expenses. However, because the Guangdong government considered this amount of travel expenses to be too large, it must be submitted for discussion and approval at the State Council meeting on the 22nd before it can be issued. Therefore, the date for the representatives to go north to petition has been delayed. Once the travel expenses are received, the student delegation can depart. In addition, the student community recently requested the Guangdong government to quickly send personnel to train student volunteer soldiers. When the Student Anti-Japanese United Association was established, a military training committee was organized. Recently, the Guangdong government also established a student army training committee. Yesterday, student representatives asked Xiang Hanping, the representative of the Guangdong government, to explain how the powers of these two committees are defined. Xiang said that military training is a matter of military secrets, and of course, the military training committee organized by the national government is the formal guiding agency, and the military training committee organized by the Student Association can only serve as a liaison agency. Afterwards, the student representatives requested instructions on the allocation methods, which should be based on schools, with fifty people per class, and two hours of training per day. The allocation of instructors has also become a problem. Because He Tong, the General Supervisor of Student Military Training, is still in Hong Kong and has not indicated whether he will take office, at least three hundred instructors are needed to handle the training. The government intends to have graduates from the Whampoa Military Academy or students from the First Army Corps Academy serve as instructors, but it has not yet been decided. (December 22nd)</p>
<h3>Missing Leader of the Mongolian Youth Party</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, Gotengfu Wang, the leader of the Mongolian Youth Party, has recently disappeared suddenly. It is reported that Gotengfu Wang was in Hailar earlier this month and then went to Manzhouli. His concubine is currently traveling in Russia. Wang went to the Soviet consulate a few days ago to request a passport and has not been seen since. It is rumored that he has been kidnapped by suspicious Soviet merchants. It is also rumored that Wang intended to take advantage of the situation and lead Mongolian soldiers to launch an uprising in southern Manchuria, so he was assassinated by the Mongolian Communist Party's Dai Luolishi De.</p>
<h3>Part of Japan's Illegal Pending Cases (7)</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Japanese Consulate Arbitrarily Removes Seals on Opium Den Case: The Yifa Foreign Firm's opium den at No. 5 Gaojie Lane, Fuzhou City, was previously declared by the Japanese Consul stationed in Fuzhou as having no connection with Japanese nationals. On August 15th of the 19th year [of the Republic], the opium den was raided by the authorities, and the case was transferred to the court for investigation, and the building was sealed. The Japanese Consul suddenly claimed that although the Yifa Foreign Firm had been declared to have no connection with Japanese nationals, Consul had permitted Japanese national, Hou Yi's request to operate in the house selling marine products. They requested the seal be removed to allow Hou Yi to reside there temporarily for one and a half months. While negotiations were underway, on October 23rd, the Japanese Consul suddenly sent personnel to destroy the seal on the building. Japanese national Hou Yi then re-displayed scattered sundry goods in the building. Furthermore, in March of the 20th year [of the Republic], the Japanese Consul stationed in Fuzhou privately removed the seal on the opium den at No. 2 Houtian Lane, which had been sealed by order, and affixed a seal of the Japanese Imperial Consulate in Fuzhou. The opium den was also owned by Japanese national Lin Luogu. Based on the facts, we successively sent documents to the Japanese Ambassador to China for negotiations, but received no response.</p>
<p>Conflict Between Chinese and Japanese Military Police in Longjing Village: Around 9 PM on October 6th of the 19th year [of the Republic], while Longjing Village, Yanji, was under curfew, more than ten armed individuals advanced towards the army post on Xin'an Street. Upon being questioned, they suddenly opened fire. The sentries returned fire. It was later discovered that two were killed and one was injured, all of whom were Japanese police officers. Using this as a pretext, Japan dispatched a large number of armed police officers, who entered the country freely. We immediately sent a letter to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, requesting him to urgently telegraph the Japanese government, ordering the Japanese police officers who had arrived in Longjing to be immediately withdrawn. At the same time, we telegraphed the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to investigate the truth and negotiate a resolution with the Japanese Consul nearby. On November 20th, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee telegraphed back, stating that the case had been resolved through negotiations between the Director of the Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office and the Japanese Consul-General. The resolution included: (1) The Director expressed regret to the Consul-General; (2) Those responsible and those who acted would be punished, and an oral notification would be given; (3) A condolence payment of 10,000 Japanese yen and medical expenses of 200 yen would be paid within one week. It is currently unknown whether the case has been closed, as no reports have been received from the local authorities.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Oppression of the Andong City Electric Light Plant Case: On April 28th of this year, the Andong City Electric Light Plant sent workers to the north of the Ba Dao Gou Railway to replace wooden poles. While they were working, Japanese railway guards spotted them and suddenly brought dozens of guards, who watched over the workers and took away the construction ropes. The plant manager, upon hearing the news, immediately went with the secretary of the county government to reason with them and explain the situation. By this time, the number of guards who had arrived had reached five to six hundred, armed with live ammunition, intimidating them in every possible way, and forcing the county government secretary to issue a written apology on the spot. The captain of the guards, Heng You, was particularly egregious. Only after they had fully indulged in their violence did they release the workers.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships "Fuyo" and Others Sail into Inland Rivers Case: At 3 PM on May 18th of this year, the Japanese cruiser "Fuyo" sailed from the Guanhai River estuary, passing through Shuanggang, directly into Xiangshui Estuary, taking photographs along the way, and anchoring for about ten minutes. Later, due to the large number of onlookers, the ship lowered its Japanese flag and set sail out of the estuary. Based on dispatches from the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China on June 20th, stating that the Japanese warship had entered Chinese inland rivers without the permission of our government and had taken photographs along the way, which violated international practice and disregarded Chinese sovereignty. It sternly ordered the Japanese warship not to enter Chinese territory without permission in the future. According to the Japanese reply on July 9th, the Japanese warship "Fuyo" did take photographs along the Guanhai River to Xiangshui, but this was done according to the usual peaceful practices and did not have any hostile intent. Furthermore, the photography was done outside the fortress area and was merely for sightseeing, and did not violate international practice or infringe on sovereignty. We again sent a note to the Japanese side on July 21st, stating that foreign warships must not enter without notifying the government of the host nation, which is an international practice recognized by all countries. We again requested that they strictly instruct their warships to comply. However, the Japanese side replied again on August 18th, stating that foreign warships can enter any port in China under the treaty, and there is no doubt about the above principle based on past practice. We also received a telegram from the Hunan Provincial Government stating that the Japanese gunboat "Toba" had sailed to Xiangtan, and we protested to the Japanese side on September 5th together in a single case. Regarding the statement that foreign warships can enter any port in China under the treaty, there is no such provision in the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, which has already expired. The Japanese side replied again on September 16th, stating that foreign warships can enter any port in China under the treaty, and Japanese warships can enjoy the same treatment based on the most-favored-nation clause. There is no doubt about the understanding between China and Japan regarding maintaining the current state of the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty and treaty relations.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Forcibly Occupies Farmland in Linyu as a Firing Range Case: Four residents of Linyu County, Hebei, Wang Ziliang, Chi Chengjiu, Zhao Jingxu, and Chu Chengming, owned land located north of Tujiazhuang in the 16th township of the 1st district of the county, which was a little over two li away from the Japanese garrison camp. The garrison did not notify Wang Ziliang and his tenants, forcibly removed the crops from the fields, and occupied them as a firing range. They also dug trenches about 400 bow in length and 50 bow in width on both sides as boundaries. When Wang and his tenants, as well as the village leaders of Tujiazhuang, tried to reason with them, the garrison was unreasonable and continued to occupy the land. In June of the 20th year [of the Republic], Wang and others filed a complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Second Korean Riot Case: On July 2nd of this year, Japanese and Korean newspapers, taking advantage of the Wanbaoshan Incident, issued special editions, fabricating facts and inciting Koreans to riot against the Chinese. Massacres of overseas Chinese occurred successively in Incheon, Gyeongseong, Pyongyang, Zhennampo, Wonsan, Sinuiju, and other places. Pyongyang was particularly severe, and the riots spread throughout Korea for more than ten days. A total of 143 overseas Chinese were killed, 72 were missing, 343 were injured, and direct losses were estimated at 3 million Japanese yen, with countless indirect losses. At that time, the Consul-General stationed in Korea negotiated for protection and suppression, but the other side was evasive and did not make serious preparations afterward, intentionally neglecting the case. After lodging a protest with the Japanese ambassador, the other side repeatedly used the Wanbaoshan incident as an excuse and refused to take responsibility. Later, an eight-point solution was proposed, including apology, punishment of the perpetrators, compensation for deaths and injuries, and guarantees of future security, but no reply has been received.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Use Protection as an Excuse: Korean Farmers from Wanbaoshan Arbitrarily Enter the Interior Case: Hao Yongde, manager of the Changchun Changnong Company, leased over 400 xiang of barren land in Wanbaoshan in April of this year and recruited Korean nationals to plant rice. The county approved an order for investigation, but did not approve the filing of the case (the lease stipulated that it would be invalid if the county government did not approve it). However, Hao immediately brought over 180 Korean nationals into the country, digging waterways more than 20 li long, occupying and destroying farmland, directly connecting to the riverbank, and intercepting the river to build dams. The people nearby, fearing that tens of thousands of mu of cultivated land on both sides would be destroyed, gathered representatives to request the county government and the Municipal Preparatory Office to stop it. The county sent police to suppress and disperse the Koreans. However, the Japanese Consul had already sent six police officers to the scene to interfere. Later, the Jilin Provincial Government and the Japanese Consul-General agreed to withdraw the police and discuss the matter further. After the police were withdrawn, the Changchun authorities agreed that the Koreans would stop work and that both sides would jointly investigate and make a decision. After the joint investigation, the Municipal Office drafted a solution and submitted it to the Japanese Consul. However, the Japanese Consul completely rejected the restoration of the destroyed farmland and the cessation of river dam construction. He also ordered a large group of Koreans and sent five or sixty plainclothes police officers, carrying machine guns, to forcibly occupy civilian houses, claiming to protect the work and the completion of the river dam project. On July 1st, three to four hundred people, each holding chisels and hoes, went to fill in the water intakes. The Japanese police suddenly opened fire on the people, and our police tried their best to suppress the situation to prevent a major incident. The Changchun Municipal Office protested on the basis of reason, but the Japanese side completely ignored it. The Jilin Provincial Government then telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and on July 22nd, a note was sent to the Japanese Ambassador stating that Wanbaoshan was not a residential area, and Korean farmers were not allowed to go there. The lease agreement between them and Hao Yongde had not been approved for filing. Local officials had the responsibility to maintain public order and protect foreigners, so how could the Japanese police arbitrarily enter the interior? They requested the Japanese Ambassador to transfer the order and quickly withdraw the Japanese police who had been sent. The contract between the Korean farmers and Hao Yongde would naturally not take effect. If there were losses due to the lease, they should be compensated. The Chinese farmers should also be compensated by the Korean farmers for the losses caused by digging waterways and other damages to the fields. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note was fair in its attitude and originally hoped for an early and impartial solution to avoid disputes. However, the Japanese Ambassador replied on August 26th that he did not pay attention to the fact that Hao Yongde had no right to enter into a contract with the Korean farmers, and the Korean farmers had no right to occupy the farmland in Wanbaoshan. Instead, he said that it was necessary for the Japanese Consul to send armed Japanese police to assist the illegal work of the Korean farmers. He believed that the Chinese police's legal dissolution of the Korean farmers who were illegally cultivating farmland, digging ditches, and building dams in Wanbaoshan was a policy of oppression, disregarding treaty law, reason, and facts. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the Japanese Ambassador on September 15th, the main points of which were: (1) This time, the Korean farmers' cultivation of farmland, digging ditches, and building dams involved criminal matters. Our police's obstruction was the proper exercise of administrative power and should not be considered oppression of Korean farmers. The Japanese note said that the Korean farmers' lease agreement with Hao had been approved by the county magistrate, and an understanding had been reached with the landowners of the waterway, so the waterway project began in mid-April, and local officials and related landowners never interfered, which was not the case. Moreover, the Korean farmers' lease agreement with Hao had not been approved by the county government. When the Korean farmers went to Sun Yongqing and other places in April, they were stopped and work was suspended by Sun Yongqing and Ma Baoshan and others. After that, work was suspended and resumed several times. How could there have been a prior understanding? (2) The Japanese note said that the Korean farmers' actions were all in good faith and that if floods occurred due to the water conservancy project, the Korean farmers were prepared to compensate. The original lease contract of Hao Yongde had not been approved by the county, so it was invalid from the beginning. Therefore, regardless of whether the Korean farmers' lease was in good faith, the contract between the Korean farmers and Hao Yongde could not produce any rights. The Korean farmers' cultivation of farmland, digging ditches, and building dams were all illegal. Moreover, the digging of ditches was outside the wasteland leased in the contract between them and Hao, which was even more illegal. The Korean farmers themselves knew that it was illegal, so they prepared to compensate for the losses, which could hardly avoid criminal responsibility. (3) According to the Tumen River Boundary Treaty, Korean people were only allowed to cultivate and reside in specific areas of Yanji, Helong, and Wangqing north of the Tumen River. Assuming that the land leased by the Korean farmers in this case was within the scope of that area, they still could not obtain any rights due to the invalidity of the contract. Moreover, this case was outside the area allowed by the treaty, and the contract they signed was invalid. Regarding the issue of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1915 mentioned in the Japanese note, that issue was originally a minor matter in this case under the above judgment. Moreover, a formal statement was made to the Japanese side in March 1923. (4) In short, the Chinese authorities are legally suppressing those who want to acquire rights illegally, and there is no intention to oppress Korean farmers. Based on the above reasons, Korean farmers cannot cultivate or occupy farmland in Wanbaoshan. Please transfer the order and order the Korean farmers to withdraw from the area immediately. The legal relationship between the Korean farmers and Hao Yongde arising from the invalid contract should be resolved as soon as possible. The losses of the Chinese farmers should still be compensated by the Korean farmers as soon as possible to resolve the matter. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued this second note, the Japanese side has not yet replied.</p>
<p>Tumen River Japanese Military Exercise Case: In August of this year, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee telegraphed that the engineering unit in Hoe Ryong, Korea, planned to conduct bridge-building and marching exercises on the banks of the Yuchuan River for three weeks starting from the 4th of this month. Over 200 Japanese soldiers arrived in Chengchuan on the Japanese bank of the Tumen River. On the 8th, Japanese ships were seen on the Chinese bank, and the number of Japanese soldiers in Chengchuan increased by 400. Eight tents were set up, and 30 sailboats carrying over 100 Japanese soldiers sailed from Hoe Ryong to Chengchuan. By the 11th, 34 Japanese engineers had intruded into our country's riverbank, burying two wooden stakes and inserting small red and green flags for bridge building and surveying. The Magistrate of Unchun County repeatedly protested to the Japanese Consul there, Chang Er, and informed him to stop the bridge building. The Japanese Consul agreed to transfer the order, but said that the exercise was fixed and it would be difficult to stop. The Tumen River is a river shared by China and Japan. The Japanese military's bridge-building exercises in the basin violated international law and infringed on Chinese sovereignty. We sent a note to the Japanese ambassador on the 14th to stop it and prevent such actions from happening again. However, at 1 PM on the 15th, six or seven Japanese engineers set off 25 explosions in the center of the river. At 4 PM, 30 engineers rode in two small motorboats and toured in the center of the river for about nine hours. Over 30 Japanese guards, carrying two machine guns, crossed our riverbank to conduct exercises and fired three times. We still checked the note on the 14th and sent a second note to the Japanese ambassador on the 26th, strictly prohibiting it, but received no reply. Furthermore, according to a report from the Northeast Border Defense Army Headquarters, the commander of the Japanese 19th Division, Mori Hisashi, came to Hunchun on the morning of the 17th and left at 6 PM in the afternoon. At 4 PM that afternoon, Japanese engineers transported seven floating bridge piers using iron boats. On the 18th, they transported 12 more and a steamer sailed upstream. At 3 AM on the 19th, the bridge piers were transported back to Qingyuan Crossing, and over 200 Japanese soldiers built a bridge on our shore, fixing about five bridge piers and floating 35 bridge piers, completing it at 9 AM. About 100 infantrymen passed back and forth twice from the east bank. At 10 PM on the 18th, at Jiaxinzai on the eastern side of the boundary river, there were five Japanese soldiers, a searchlight, and over 100 Japanese soldiers on both the east and west banks of the river, each carrying two machine guns, conducting confrontation exercises. The Japanese soldiers on the west side boarded boats to cross the river, and the Japanese soldiers on the east side resisted, preventing the river from being crossed and shooting at each other. The exercise stopped at 3 PM on the 19th and completely withdrew, crossing over to the west bank. At 12 PM that day, the previously built pontoon bridge was dismantled, and over 100 vehicles were hired to transport all the materials used in the Tumen River exercise completely away. This exercise was completed on the 20th, and there were no traces of Japanese troops in the area on the 21st. (End)</p>

This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Qian Songyao himself had gone to Ningbo and had not returned. Only his wife, maid, coachman, and five others were at home. Suddenly, seven robbers arrived, carrying two handguns, claiming to be delivering a letter. When the coachman, A'er (also known as Gengsheng), opened the door, the robbers rushed in, displayed their handguns, drove the servants to the kitchen, and guarded the telephone and doors. They went straight upstairs and robbed the house. Afterwards, the hostess inspected the lost items and found that they had been robbed of over 200 yuan in silver dollars, four diamond rings, one diamond bracelet, and gold jewelry and fine clothing worth approximately 7,000 to 8,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Provincial Order Urges Collection of Cotton Business Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, based on a report from the Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, stated in a letter from Zhang Shouyi, the head of the Cotton Business Tax Collection Committee in Changshu County, that the county is a cotton-producing area. Every harvest season, yarn factories from neighboring counties send personnel to Changshu to set up cotton collection points, which all close by the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. This year, when the business tax was first collected, these cotton collection points were repeatedly urged to pay the tax. However, the collection points initially denied it and then procrastinated. For example, the Wuxi Guangqin Yarn Factory had a business volume of 270,000 yuan, and the short-term business tax should be 2 per mille, totaling 540 yuan. Qingfeng's business volume was 240,000 yuan, and the tax should be 488 yuan. Yukan's business volume was 280,000 yuan, and the tax should be 560 yuan. Shenxin's business volume was 220,000 yuan, and the tax should be 440 yuan. Zhenxin's business volume was 110,000 yuan, and the tax should be 220 yuan. After receiving the report, the department yesterday issued a special order to the county government of this city, immediately ordering the above factories to strictly collect and report. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen has already complied.</p>
<p>Daytime Robbery on Main Street in City: The Cheng Silver Shop on Main Street in the city, which was established with funds raised by Fang Youhe, has been doing well in business. At 3 PM yesterday (the 26th), a rogue wearing short clothes suddenly entered the shop under the pretext of exchanging gold rings. Shop assistant Feng Nianzu took out two gold rings and placed them on the counter. Unexpectedly, the rogue dared to take advantage of the unpreparedness of the people and robbed them, fleeing towards Xiangchengjiao. Seeing this, Feng Nianzu immediately stepped forward to chase and shout for the thief, and other shop assistants joined in the chase. The rogue was captured, and the patrolling police from the Fourth Precinct brought him into the station. Chief Zhu of the precinct held a preliminary trial. The suspect confessed his name was Li Da and admitted to robbing the Cheng Silver Shop of gold rings. After verifying the confession, Chief Zhu believed that the suspect dared to commit robbery in broad daylight in the busy market, which was extremely illegal. He immediately prepared a document to send to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Chief of the 16th Precinct Bribed to Replace Smuggler: Shen Jizhou, Chief of the 16th Precinct of the Public Security Bureau in Anzhen, District 8 (Huai Xia City), has been in office for less than a month. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, Bureau member Huang Bingjian led police officers Zhao Changchun and Wang Jinshan on patrol in the east market of the town when they discovered a drug offender named Cai Juquan, and found two bags of opium and three cans of red pills (totaling 318 pills) on him. He was immediately taken to the bureau. After Chief Shen held a preliminary trial, it is unknown how, he released the drug offender Cai Juquan and hired Mi Tiansheng, who was addicted to red pills, to go to the bureau, impersonating him. The next day, he was vaguely sent to the Public Security Bureau. When Section Chief Fu Hongsheng of the Third Section learned of this, he conducted a detailed study of the case with Section Member Zhang Shuping and realized that the precinct chief and bureau members had taken bribes to cover up evidence. He reported to Chief Hua and sent Inspector Zhang Zijing to the countryside to investigate and verify the facts, and obtained a written certificate signed jointly by Patrol Captain Yin Hongsheng and police officer Zhao Changchun of the precinct. He returned to the bureau and reported to Chief Hua for verification. Later, Section Chief Fu interrogated the arrested fake Cai Juquan. The suspect confessed that his name was Mi Tiansheng and he was replacing Cai Juquan in the case. Chief Fu verified the confession and immediately sent police to the countryside to summon the real Cai Juquan and Gu Dongliang to the case. Yesterday, along with Mi Tiansheng, they were all transferred to the County Court for trial. As for how the precinct chief and bureau members should be dealt with, Chief Hua will report to the county government for verification.</p>

He was known for his composure and outstanding talent, and was considered a promising individual by the local gentry. Recently, Zhu became indignant at the violent invasion by Japan, fearing the nation would perish. He intended to rally his comrades to join the volunteer army and fight the Japanese invaders to the death. Someone informed his father of this by letter. His father, a merchant, was ignorant of national affairs and deeply loved his son. He tricked his son into returning home with a telegram on other matters. Upon learning he had been deceived, Zhu became despondent. He wrote two letters to his classmates, expressing guilt for not being able to face the national crisis with them and hoping that his classmates would strive to kill the enemy. On the 20th, he ingested four mace of opium. The dose was lethal, and he could not be saved. He died shortly thereafter at the young age of eighteen.

<p>Important Educational News</p>
<h3>Educational Circles of Songjiang County</h3>
<p>Request Rectification of Primary School Education</p>
<p>The colleagues of the educational circles of Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, sent an express telegram which reads: Urgent. Via Shenbao, to the members of the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Executive Committee, including committee member Mr. Hengyuan, and all committee members, for your review. Education is the foundation of a nation, and culture is the light of a people. If we want the country to prosper and the nation to unite, we must rely on education, especially primary school education. Everyone knows this. Consider Japan's Meiji Restoration, which prioritized primary school education. In just a few decades, the results were remarkable. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the rulers have not failed to emphasize primary school education. However, most of the national funding is used for military expenditures, leaving no specific funds to subsidize education in local areas. In some cases, provincial authorities have even issued orders to cut schools or reduce school funding and teacher salaries due to local financial constraints. Looking at this county, in recent years, even without a shortage of educational funding, there have still been cases of cutting schools, reducing school funding, and lowering teacher salaries. This is true even without the excuse of financial difficulties in other counties. In this era, even if we cannot expand education rapidly, we should at least ensure that educators are not burdened by the pressures of life and can teach with peace of mind, thereby increasing the efficiency of teaching. If China wants to promote national spirit and revitalize the country, it must rely on primary school education. The quality of primary school education depends on primary school teachers. This goes without saying. The only way to achieve national survival under the oppression of the great powers is to rectify primary school education. Methods for rectifying primary school education: (1) The government should allocate specific funds to subsidize local primary school funding. (2) Expand primary school funding. (3) Increase primary school teacher salaries. If the above three points can be realized immediately, there is hope for China's future. We offer these humble suggestions and hope that they will be adopted. In haste and with utmost urgency. Colleagues in the educational circles of Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, Qian Zingshou and 37 others, respectfully kowtow. [End]</p>

<h3>Various Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Students Yesterday Mourned the Deceased Students</p>
<p>More than 1,500 People Attended</p>
<p>The Atmosphere at the Venue was Solemn and Orderly</p>
<p>The United Association of Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Students of various secondary schools in this city held a memorial service for the deceased students who were killed during the demonstration in Beijing at the Jingye Middle School in Jukui Street, Xiaodongmen, at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 1,500 students and guests from various schools attended. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely solemn, and the order was also very orderly. The details of the meeting are recorded below by a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency.</p>
<p>The Meeting: The bell rang ten times, announcing the start of the meeting. The ritual of paying respects was performed. The presidium, composed of Li Bin (Huizhen), Huang Shiti (Shanghai Middle School), and Chen Yubai (Wuben), reported on the significance of the meeting: A. Remembering the deceased students. B. Having a deeper understanding of the revolutionary government. C. Continuing the spirit of the deceased students and working twice as hard. Cai Ruoxian, a representative from Shanghai Middle School, reported on the situation of the tragedy at the time. Afterwards, they paid the highest respects to the spirits of the deceased students who were killed during the demonstration in Beijing with three bows and observed three minutes of silence for the deceased students. Then, Chen Yubai of Wuben presented a wreath, and Sun Yucai of Jingtang read the eulogy.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Eulogy: On December 26th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, all the students of Shanghai's middle schools offer this sacrifice to the spirits of the deceased students who were killed during the demonstration in Beijing, saying: Alas! The Japanese invaders are provoking incidents and occupying our Binyang, devouring and encroaching on our border regions like wolves and silkworms. Their greed is insatiable, and their military force is growing. Their ambition is to sweep across and engulf everything. If we do not resist them promptly, China will perish. The affairs of the nation have come to this, but why is it not good? The students, with great enthusiasm, are running around to help each other, fighting for the country and negotiating with the central government. However, their cotton gowns are mixed with weapons, and suddenly the soldiers raise their arms. In an instant, the blades are revealed, and their forms are suddenly exposed. They are forced to resist the enemy, and their skin and blood are scattered on the battlefield. Men die, but their loyalty shines brightly. Whose hands are responsible for this bloodshed? Looking upon your heroic spirits, we pour a cup of wine. Alas, may you be satisfied!</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives: Attorney Wu Mailu, a member of the Executive Committee of the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association; Da Yijin, of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association; Qu Yicheng of Shanghai Middle School; Xiao Sizhi of Pudong Middle School; Zhang Shengpei and Wang Linxi of Junyi Middle School; Mao Yingyu of Patriotic Girls' Middle School; and Wang Weiyi of Municipal North Middle School delivered speeches in succession, expressing their condolences to the deceased students and elaborating on the issue of resisting Japan and saving the country. Their words were all filled with grief and indignation, moving the listeners. The meeting was adjourned after a group photo was taken at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. It was also heard that the association will hold its 13th meeting of representatives at Jingye Middle School in Jukui Street, Xiaodongmen, at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Professors' Association</h3>
<p>Upholding Academic Freedom...Urging the Release of Educational Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Association was previously initiated by more than 80 people, including Zhou Junshi, Pan Guangdan, Dong Renjian, Li Guochang, Wu Zelin, Zhang Yisun, Han Bing, Lu Jizeng, Zhang Xiangshi, Zhang Zhifu, Quan Zenghu, Shen Youqian, Yu Nanqiu, and Wu Songgao, and has been in existence for nearly two years. Since the invasion by the Japanese invaders, it has contacted comrades to resist Japan and save the country, sparing no effort. Recently, in view of the rapidly changing situation and the many problems faced by universities, it has sent standing committee members to various places in Beijing and Ping to strive for academic freedom and urge the release of educational funds. It has also telegraphed universities across the country, requesting them to elect professor representatives to gather in Shanghai to discuss various issues such as upholding academic freedom, promoting higher education, and improving service and treatment.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Youheng drew with Huaguang 1 to 1</p>
<p>Donghua won against Guangdong 3 to 1</p>
<h3>Tough Meets Tough, No Clear Winner</h3>
<p>Donghua and Western Police</p>
<p>| Result: 2 to 2 |</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu of Donghua, Wei Jinsheng of Western Police</p>
<p>| Amazing Performance |</p>
<p>By chance, Donghua took the lead 2-1 due to a re-taken penalty kick, and it seemed the victory would belong to Donghua today. However, in the blink of an eye, the match ended in a 2-2 draw. The more than ten thousand spectators at Yiyuan could not help but feel somewhat disappointed amidst their satisfaction. Looking at it from the other side, if Western Police had not lost a goal due to the penalty kick, they would have won 2-1. In short, the god of fortune did not want to favor one side, so the match ended in a 2-2 draw. Referee: Li Nuosi.</p>
<h3>Donghua Team</h3>
<p>Chen Pu Qian Jingyong</p>

<p>Shi Gaotuo Tou Na</p>
<p>Yimengla Ga Xu Falansi</p>
<p>Xu Tu Huishe</p>
<p>Jipson Okelei</p>
<h3>A Powerful Kick Breaks the Enemy's Net</h3>
<p>At the start, the offensive went back and forth, with mutual opportunities. After ten minutes, Okelei heavily pressed the attack, and Huishe stepped forward to meet him. Center-back Tu Kaiyuan blocked him and passed it to right winger Chen Jiaqiu, who quickly advanced and kicked it towards the goal. Dai Linjing was prepared and took the opportunity to attack. The goalkeeper gained and lost control, and with a resounding sound, the enemy's net was breached.</p>
<h3>Heading the Ball into the Goal Under Great Pressure</h3>
<p>Afterwards, Western Police took advantage of the wind and became very aggressive. Left and right corner kicks were taken in turn. If it were not for Wei's strong resistance, the defense would have been breached. Falansi's shot towards the goal was fortunately blocked, otherwise it would have been disastrous. After forty minutes, Wei Jinsheng was active on the right flank and kicked a ball, which Falansi headed into the goal. The first half ended with each side scoring one goal.</p>
<h3>Retaking the Penalty Kick Scores</h3>
<p>After a short break, the teams reorganized and continued the match. Donghua's goalkeeper Zhou escaped death twice, showing his skills. Chen Hongguang dribbled the ball forward and suddenly fell. Zhu Na kicked him instead of the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. Dai kicked it in, but the referee ruled that Western Police players had entered the area before the kick and ordered it to be retaken. This time, Dai aimed accurately and kicked it in, taking the lead 2-1.</p>
<h3>Wei Jinsheng Creates a Draw</h3>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu made several wonderful crosses, creating a tense situation. The Western Police defenders did their best, but could not advance. At the critical moment, Donghua suddenly faced an emergency. Wei Jinsheng broke through the crowd and invaded, and by chance, kicked the ball into the net, creating a 2-2 draw.</p>
<h3>Western Youth Basketball Yesterday's Results</h3>
<p>The Western Youth Basketball League had a particularly busy schedule yesterday due to it being Saturday. There were six games in the A and B groups, starting from 4:00 PM and ending at 10:00 PM. Among the games, the match between Huadong and Xiaguang was more intense. Although the strength of the two teams was not very high, they were evenly matched and their skills were balanced, resulting in fierce competition and a wonderful performance. In the end, Huadong won 29 to 22. The Jiangwan team initially had a special performance, but has declined ever since. They have lost every game, which has inevitably demoralized the team and reduced their fighting power. They lost to Qingguang again last night 27 to 47. Chizhi's military prestige remains as before, and they defeated the Hong team 49 to 37. This battle was also quite interesting. The results of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name and Group First Half Total Result</p>
<p>Fazheng won against Shagu (B) 22 to 13 36 to 29</p>
<p>Haizhe won against Ganxi (A) 16 to 8 49 to 21</p>

<p>Jin'an Defeats Jiaotong 10-0 to Retain the Championship</p>
<p>Five Goals in the First Half | Five Goals in the Second Half</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Five Goals | Qiu Dongyan Five Goals</p>
<p>Jin'an University has once again won this year's Jiangnan Eight Universities Football Championship, defeating Jiaotong University 10-0 yesterday, making it their fourth consecutive victory. Yesterday, Jin'an maintained an offensive posture throughout, arbitrarily dominating East Asia. They scored five goals in the first half and another five goals in the second half, totaling ten. It was especially commendable that Qiu Dongyan and Chen Zhenhe each scored five goals. The spectacle was no less grand than in previous years, with cheering squads and drum teams of various forms. Unfortunately, a small dispute arose after the match due to the retrieval of the ball, causing a small scare among the spectators. Fortunately, it did not escalate, which was a blessing in disguise.</p>

<h3>Situation of Winning the Championship</h3>
<h3>Jiaotong Lost Two Goals in a Row at the Beginning. Jin'an Was Like a Black Cat</h3>
<p>Shang, He Chunhui blew the whistle to start the game. Qiu Dongyan began to attack fiercely. Zhang Jizeng kicked the ball out. Xue Wenxiu advanced from the side. Yang Xinghua kicked a free kick in the center line. Jiang Shanjing headed the ball out. Jiaotong's momentum was not weak at all. After five minutes, Mei Hongbao jumped over two people and passed to Heitan. From the left, Qiu Dongyan flew up and kicked the ball into the net with a crisp sound. Within five minutes, Chen, Wen, and Qiu were circling in front of the goal. Chen Zhenhe, fifteen yards from the goal, also attacked like Qiu. Within ten minutes, Jiaotong lost two goals in a row, and everyone knew it would be difficult.</p>
<h3>Twelve-Yard Total of Five to Zero, Gu Shangrang Again</h3>
<p>The left corner was headed in, but Chen Zhenhe was offside and it didn't count. Jin'an continued to attack fiercely. For a while, a series of cannons were fired. Chen Zhenhe shot fiercely, but it went too high. Mei Hongbao also missed by a fraction. They were heading and kicking, and the sky and clouds changed color. After twenty-five minutes, Zhuang Shihong passed forward, and Chen and Qiu advanced together. Dongyan attacked the person, making it three to zero. Qiu Dongyan passed to Mei Hongbao, Mei attacked. Li Beiliang defended him. Mei hooked the ball, and Li touched it with his hand. Qiu kicked another twelve-yard penalty. Within two minutes, Qiu received the ball from Mei, making it five to zero in the first half.</p>
<h3>Change of Goal and Another Twelve-Yard Penalty, the Second Half Begins</h3>
<p>As before, Jin'an attacked near the goal. Qiu Dongyan passed to Gu Shangrang. Jiaotong forced a corner kick. Referee He discovered that Jiaotong's goalkeeper had been changed without reporting it. Chen Zhenhe kicked another twelve-yard penalty, making the score very large.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhenhe Scored Three More Goals in a Row, Passing Twenty Minutes</h3>
<p>Mei Hongbao passed to Li Baosen, who joined in the second half, then to Qiu Dongyan, avoiding Zhang Jizeng, and Chen Zhenhe made it seven to zero. Ten minutes later, Zhang Jizeng touched the ball with his hand, and Qiu's twelve-yard penalty was luckily not scored. Chen Qianhe, shooting from twenty yards away, scored again. Chen Zhenxiang hooked the ball, and Chen Zhenhe scored three more goals in a row, making it nine to zero. Finally, Qiu Dongyan shot from a distance,</p>
<p>Ending it at ten to zero.</p>
<h3>Jin'an Victory and Three Changes in Formation, Jin'an Seven to Zero</h3>
<p>Seeing that they had won a great victory, Jin'an took a break. Zhuang Shihong retreated, and Liang Shutang became the center-back. Yang Baosen replaced Liang's position, and Chen Zhenxiang filled the right inside forward position. At nine to zero, there was a big change, which is listed below:</p>
<p>Force Yang Baosen Liang Shutang</p>
<p>Gu Shangrang Qiu Dongyan</p>
<p>Jiang Zongjin Feng Yunyou Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing Chen Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Chen Fuzhong Chen Zhenhe</p>
<h3>Performance Glimpses</h3>
<p>Jin'an was very polite yesterday. Both sides had a sense of humility. There were many opportunities to attack fiercely, but they did not. There were opportunities to score, but they did not. Jiaotong's defeat was naturally due to a large difference in technical skills. Their movements were too slow, and they lacked courage. The defenders and two midfielders lost the ball too often, which explains their defeat. The forwards had opportunities to shoot, but they were too slow. In short, Jiaotong has talent but lacks experience.</p>

<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<h3>Playing Ball but Not Forgetting the National Crisis, Jiaotong's Entrance</h3>
<p>Next to the main road, there was a horizontal plaque with the following big characters: Good men, today we compete in martial arts on the stage. Jiaotong is like a living dragon, Jin'an is like a live tiger. No matter who wins or loses, we will train our skills well. We must go to the national crisis together and teach those brutal Japanese invaders a lesson.</p>
<h3>Gong and Drum Team and Military Band, Jiaotong's Entire Military Band Was at</h3>
<p>The venue to play music to cheer them on. The music was melodious and did not diminish due to the victory or defeat. Both sides also had a gong and drum team organized by the school workers, which was very lively.</p>
<h3>Dispute Arises Suddenly When Retrieving the Ball, Jin'an Students See That They Have Won</h3>
<p>One of them grabbed the ball that had been kicked and ran away. The Jiaotong students refused to give up, saying that the ball should not be taken. The Jin'an Boy Scouts escorted the student out, while Jiaotong searched at the door, and the gate was tightly closed. The 2,000 spectators, men, women, old, and young, did not know what was happening and were extremely panicked, rushing to get out. Some thought that Jiaotong's search was inappropriate. The 2,000 spectators who were locked inside were finally allowed to leave when the gate was opened, otherwise there would have been a disaster. It could be said to be a misfortune.</p>

<h3>Recollections of a Luxurious Home</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Yuan Shikai of the Hongxian era was indeed a hero of his time. However, he was misled by the encouragement of the "Six Gentlemen" and resolutely defied public anger, harboring the ambition to become emperor. Yet, he knew that without the support of imperialist powers, it would be ineffective. Zhou Ziqi's mission to Japan, even with lavish gifts, was rejected. Some say the Twenty-One Demands originated from this. At the beginning of Yuan Shikai's self-proclaimed emperorship, a sandalwood throne inlaid with nine dragons and huge pearls, costing over a million, was commissioned. The palace's round tables, cushioned pit chairs, and chair covers were all custom-made from Qiu Chen's satin shop with five-clawed nine-dragon round flower patterns, for which a deposit of 10,000 yuan was paid. They were working day and night to rush the order. By the time the work was completed, Yuan Shikai's imperial system had already melted away like ice and snow. As a result, the satin shop closed down. It is said that the losses amounted to 50,000 gold. This incident was known to the Japanese, who were willing to buy it back at a high price to keep it in a museum as a blemish. The owner of the satin shop refused. The Japanese returned in disappointment. Recently, it was heard that the five-clawed nine-dragon round table chair covers were sold to the Ministry of Railways for 30,000 gold. The dignified and magnificent brocade was not obtained by the Japanese invaders after all, which is somewhat gratifying.</p>

<h3>Qiu Shuyuan During the Cession of Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The cession of Taiwan to Japan is a major page in the history of national humiliation. The land is in eastern Fujian, comprising twenty-nine islands. It originally belonged to our country's territory. During the late Ming Dynasty, it was occupied by the Dutch. Zheng Chenggong expelled the Dutch and took it over. After the fall of the Zheng family, it reverted to the Qing Dynasty. Unexpectedly, after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, we lost the war and the land, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki stipulated the cession of Taiwan. However, the people of Taiwan had been deeply influenced by our country's culture and civilization. Patriots rose up to resist the Japanese, and Qiu Shuyuan was their leader. Qiu Shuyuan, whose given name was Wei Xuan, was originally from Haicheng, Fujian.</p>
<p>His ancestors moved to Taiwan, and he settled there. His family assets were in the millions. He was known for his generosity at the time. When the Qing court ceded Taiwan, Shuyuan repeatedly telegraphed to argue against it. He even wrote a memorial in blood. The Qing court did not listen. Shuyuan was extremely indignant and said, "The court has abandoned the land and people of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan must find a way to extricate themselves." He contributed his family wealth to support the army and organized the Republic of Formosa, electing Tang Jingsong and Liu Yongfu as president and vice president, respectively. Later, the provincial garrison troops mutinied, burning the government office and looting the treasury. The rebellion failed. Shuyuan could not bear to be under Japanese citizenship. Therefore, he went to Guangdong. He also lived in Singapore, calling himself the "Retired Gentleman of Xingzhou." He founded the Tiannan Newspaper. Later, he built a house in his old residence in Haicheng to take care of his parents. He lectured at the Hanshan and Dongshan Academies in Chaozhou. He also founded the Lingdong Tongwen Academy. During the Xinhai Revolution, Shuyuan briefly served as Minister of Education. He was also elected as a representative of Guangdong. After the unification of the North and South, he was elected as a senator. He died of illness shortly after. It was March 25th of the first year of the Republic. His life's works include "Shuyuan's Trivial Talks" in eight volumes, followed by "Occasional Remnants of Gengyin" and "Poems of Ren Chen." Among them are poems harmonizing with ancient themes, such as "Bo Yi": "Not meeting the Yellow Emperor and Shennong, but the Xia Dynasty. The shadows of brothers alone in the universe. Subtle words want to be sent by the clear wind. Tang and Wu have learned from Shun and Yao since ancient times." "Su Wu": "Ten thousand miles of mountains and passes, the moonlight is fading. Herding rams in the snowy cave, enduring the desolate cold. Returning, I do not see my living wife. I should regret marrying a woman in the land of the Huns." "Yang Xiong": "It's not that writing is not important for thousands of years. It turns out to praise the new dynasty with writing. If you want to ask the rulers in the Nine Springs, how can this hatred be dispelled?" They are truly valuable works. Reading his poems allows one to imagine the person. Thus, I record it as such.</p>
<h3>World Briefs</h3>
<p>A Couple Married for Seventy-Four Years: In Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England, there is an elderly man named William Walker who has been married for seventy-four years. This is considered the longest marriage record in England. He is ninety-four years old this year, and his wife is ninety-three years old. They have a son who is seventy years old. This family of elders lives a very happy life, which is truly enviable. According to Mr. Walker, "When we got married, all we had was two pounds in cash. The furniture in the house consisted of only a bed, a table, and a few chairs. At that time, I was helping people work in the fields, earning two shillings a day. But we tried our best to save and put aside a little money. So now we can live in our own house, and we have some other property. We also have some savings in the bank." Regarding the way to a loving marriage, Mrs. Walker has a good recipe that can be introduced to women all over the world. Mrs. Walker said, "Always make sure your husband eats well, and no matter what, let him do what he wants to do. There is no need to argue with him. This is the only way to keep him calm, and this is very important in married life."</p>
<h3>An Overview of Ma Zhanshan's Troop Training</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan's troops are all strong men in their prime. They rise at 5:00 AM and sleep at 8:00 PM. During the day, they undergo five training sessions and three lectures. There is also an emergency assembly at midnight. Soldiers are often awakened from deep sleep by the sound of sirens. They immediately jump up and put on their full gear in the dark. They also have to fold their bedding neatly. Then, they grope for their guns in the armory. They then line up on the parade ground. The time elapsed is only five minutes. If their clothes are not neat, their bedding is messy, or they grab the wrong gun, they will be punished.</p>
<p>The most unbearable things are the midnight assembly in winter and the midday drill in summer. After the former assembly, they start running for thirty minutes. The soldiers are sweating profusely. Suddenly, they stand still for a lecture, which also lasts for twenty to thirty minutes. At that time, the sweat on the soldiers' clothes is immediately frozen into ice by the cold wind during the lecture. When they change clothes after the dismissal, the skin on their chest and back has been scraped off by the ice. This happens every day. The latter occurs in the hot summer. They have a drill every day at noon. Often, after the drill, the soldiers' clothes, which are originally gray, are covered with a layer of white frost, which is formed by the condensation of sweat.</p>
<p>There are also regulations for meals. Each person can only eat twelve taels of corn rice per meal. As for vegetables, a company shares a pot of green vegetables, with only four taels of soybean oil added. Other breakfast side dishes are either two pieces of radish per person or one pickled green vegetable per person.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of field training. Often, they go out for several months before returning. No dry food is prepared. They eat wherever they go.</p>
<p>Soldiers always wear military uniforms and are not allowed to wear casual clothes. They are not allowed to wear rings or other extravagant items. The most forbidden things are prostitution and gambling. Therefore, they must stay in camp every night. If they do not answer the roll call, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>In summary, although it is a simple overview, it also shows the spirit of General Ma's troop training. Imagine soldiers who have undergone such rigorous training. How can they not be brave and strong? I hope that all the troops in our country are like this. Then, how can we have the fear of national destruction?</p>
<h3>Parental Education</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The China Philanthropic Association for Children aims to assist in the happiness of children. It is jointly organized by Chinese and American educators. The chairman is Minister Kong Xiangxi. There are two vice-chairmen: Dr. Luo Yunyan and Mrs. Guo Bingwen. Other executive committee members are enthusiastic philanthropists from both China and the United States, half men and half women, regardless of nationality and gender. They are all very diligent in their association affairs. The general manager, Wu Weide, is shrewd and capable, so the association's affairs are thriving. The other day, the association held a meeting and invited Professor Chen Heqin, the current director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the editor-in-chief of the Children's Education Monthly, to give a lecture. Choucheng went to participate. Because what Mr. Chen said about children's education starts with parental education, it is indeed a fundamental solution. We who are over forty years old and have children must adopt this kind of proposition. I dare not keep it to myself. Therefore, I have extracted the main points I heard that day as follows.</p>
<p>Children are born from parents. If you want to talk about children's education, you should first pay attention to father-child training. Parental education is the prerequisite for children's training. The mistakes that parents make with children are due to viewing children as their own property, their own successors. Because they are not yet adults, they are called "little people." They do not recognize that they have knowledge. Therefore, problems arise between children and parents, thinking that parents are always right, and their mistakes must be in the children. This is why our country has the saying "There are no parents in the world who are wrong." Parents treat their children according to their own joys and sorrows. When happy, they play with the children, making them laugh. When unhappy, they beat and scold the children, forcing them to cry. Even when husband and wife are at odds, they vent their anger on the children, not knowing that children are rich in imitation. They pay close attention to every move of their parents. Therefore, as parents, they should be careful about children's education everywhere. If there is any discord between husband and wife, even if they want to quarrel, they should avoid the children's presence. Otherwise, bad impressions will enter the children's minds, which is very inappropriate. Also, children are naturally lively and naturally active. In our country's old customs, children are often forbidden to play, wanting to cultivate a gentle and refined attitude, which is completely contrary to educational principles. The best thing for parents to do is to be bystanders in all of the children's actions, without always assuming that children's knowledge is incomplete, wanting to supervise and help with their own ideas, and interfering horizontally. Children have the psychology of children and should follow their psychology to develop the habit of doing things from an early age. This is what parents should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Moral Education and Aesthetic Education (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fang Jiangshui</p>
<p>However, how to cultivate the spirit is difficult to say. In the past, the Englishman Spencer wrote "Knowable" and "Unknowable." At the beginning of our lives, we are ignorant.</p>
<p>Coming, I do not know where I came from. After I die, the spirit is annihilated, and I do not know where I am going. This is the mystery of life and cannot be known.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, humans are the most intelligent of all things, which means that humans can know the intelligence of all things. What we do not know may be more intelligent than humans, so I also have things I know and do not know about how to cultivate personality and I do not dare to be confident.</p>
<p>The establishment of every theory has its own outline. Therefore, Christianity has the Creed, Islam has the Creed, and Taoism and Buddhism have the Creed. The cultivation of the spirit also has a creed. Although opinions vary, the creeds are different. It is okay to say wisdom, benevolence, and courage. It is also okay to say love, affection, and sincerity. I have thought about this many times. Now, please let me elaborate on it and discuss it with you. There are five creeds.</p>
<p>First, be ambitious. As the saying goes, all evils are born of short-sightedness. Therefore, those who want to accomplish great things cannot be constrained by trivial matters. Their minds should be broad, and their vision should be far-sighted. Zigong said, "The wise discuss the big things, and the unworthy know the small things." This is the difference between great men and small men.</p>
<p>Second, be transcendent and open-minded. "Transcendent" means detached, and "open-minded" means magnanimous. This should be the case with fame and fortune. The ancients said that before the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of fame. Why should one's own name be desired to be passed down forever? Even to the point of deliberately distorting and fabricating to gain fame and reputation. However, what do we know about the name after death? Even if there are books, they may be discarded. What can we do? I only know that the spirit has a place to be entrusted. Do not be honored by gaining fame, and do not be worried about losing fame. Just listen to it. As for the pursuit of material things, insatiable greed is even more meaningless. The unrest in society is caused by this. People's desires are hard to fill. A lifetime of energy is wasted on this. How pitiful! It is enough to have a decent life. What is the benefit of excessive pursuit?</p>
<p>Third, be diligent and hard-working. Whether one is a saint, a sage, a hero, or a great man, or even a villain, a traitor, or a rebellious son, nothing can be achieved without diligence and hard work. As the saying goes, "Excellence comes from diligence." If you are not diligent in walking, it is difficult to reach your destination. If you are not diligent in eating and drinking, you will not be full all day. Shouldn't we encourage each other?</p>
<p>Fourth, be honest and sincere. People who are honest and do not deceive can gain the trust of society. This is the way to be sincere to others. Work hard and study diligently. You can achieve success. This is the way to be sincere to yourself. The ancients said, "Where sincerity reaches, even metal and stone will be opened." Only with sincerity can all undertakings be accomplished.</p>
<p>Fifth, be benevolent and kind. When people come into contact with each other, love arises. Only when people love each other can there be peace. Confucius said, "The benevolent love people." He also said, "Love all people and be close to the benevolent." Therefore, the words "benevolence and kindness" are the ropes that maintain society. This should be the case with people, and it should also be the case with things, so as to avoid the occurrence of cruel and inhumane events.</p>
<p>The above five are extremely ordinary and extremely common. Everyone can achieve them, and none can be missing. Like the five grains to human life, they are born if they are obtained and die if they are abandoned. If people can pay attention to cultivating themselves in this regard, then noble thoughts, great spirit, and pure personality can be established. With such thoughts, spirit, and personality, whether one is writing articles, poems, books, or paintings, or extending it to everything else, one can reach the realm of perfection. Isn't this just being a simple artist? Therefore, I say that moral education is also the foundation of education. (Moved to help with disaster relief)</p>
<h3>War! (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Weibin</p>
<p>"At that time, I was under Wang Zhiping, and we were ordered to go to Huangdu."</p>
<p>"Were you afraid?" I asked, deliberately.</p>
<p>"Tch! What's there to be afraid of?"</p>
<p>"What were your thoughts at the time?"</p>
<p>"No thoughts."</p>
<p>"No, because I want to study the psychology of soldiers, please think about what you felt at the time, what kind of expectations did you have?" I pressed him closely.</p>
<p>He thought for a while and replied, "I felt like I was going to a strange place, and if there was a possibility of contact, it would be meaningful. As for what I expected, I felt like I was about to change my position."</p>
<p>"Did you think about the danger of separation from your comrades nearby?"</p>
<p>"No, we seemed to be full of enthusiasm, hoping to see some victory soon. We were very relaxed in the trenches not far from the station, playing chess, playing mahjong, thick bottles of foreign wine, canned cigarettes and food, we enjoyed ourselves to the fullest. At that time, everything was much more equal than usual except for military orders."</p>
<p>He continued, "At that time, we played mahjong, using whole pieces of cooked ham, cutting them with knives and eating them, listening to the sound of guns and cannons outside. If it got close, we could play another round. Scouts often reported news from the trenches, the telephone rang constantly, and the sound of guns was close. 'Let's go out and "deal with it"!' So we closed the mahjong tiles, grabbed our weapons, and went to "deal with it." I remember that on August 17, the Soviet army rushed into Huangdu Station, but this time it was a victory. The two regimental commanders, Wang and Li Mingcheng (the old foreigner from Henan), bravely sacrificed themselves for the country while charging forward!"</p>
<p>It can be seen that such Chinese troops did not have the idea of life and death when facing the enemy. That Chinese war did not frighten foreigners, let alone the Japanese devils. We used five people to fight to the death against one Japanese person. When the Japanese were dead, half of the Chinese were still left, and 200 million compatriots were left to revitalize China.</p>
<p>War! is the only way out for the Chinese nation to survive today!</p>

<h3>Finance: Interest Rates Slightly Higher, Interbank Lending Still Loose</h3>
<p>The market is very quiet during the bank closures.</p>
<p>Market Overview: In the past two days, due to the bank closures of the Bank of China, although Chinese merchants were operating as usual, it was also relatively quiet. However, the current money supply has loosened, and the impact on various relationships has largely returned to normal. However, the year-end settlement of funds by the silver and money industry is quite difficult, and the return of accounts by customers is particularly slow. The financial crisis is more difficult than any other year-end.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Interest Rate): The early morning interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 2 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half. The noon interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 3 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half, which seemed to be half a li better than the previous day. (Silver Interest Rate): Both the morning and noon markets were 8 fen, which was the same as the previous day. The situation was quite weak, and it has probably returned to the old situation.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market: The Jiangnan small silver dollar early morning was still 6 qian 5 fen 4 li. The noon market was reduced by 1 li, calculated as 6 qian 5 fen 3 li. The transaction volume in the early morning was 3,000 jiao, and in the noon market, it was 2,500 jiao. The Guangdong small silver dollar early morning was 6 qian 5 fen 7 li and a half. The noon market was 6 qian 5 fen 8 li, which was also 1 li lower than the previous day. The transaction volume in the early morning was 95,000 jiao, and in the noon market, it was 40,000 jiao. Copper coins were reduced by 2,500 wen to 364,000 wen.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars (Silver Funds): Yesterday, foreign merchants' banks were still closed. On the Chinese merchants' side, in addition to the Bund holiday, although there were receipts and deliveries, they were also sparse. Silver firms and money changers received and delivered more than 45 million yuan. The receipts and deliveries of head-scratching money are unknown. The amount of remittances from various routes was more than 200,000 yuan. (Foreign Funds): The early morning transaction volume of remittances and drafts was 695,000 yuan, and banknotes were 45,000 yuan. The noon market transaction volume of remittances and drafts was 1,285,000 yuan, and banknotes were 70,000 yuan. The early morning off-exchange banknote volume was 90,000 yuan, and the noon market was 50,000 yuan. Money changers and foreign firms received and delivered more than 6.3 million yuan. The transaction volume of small money changers was more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Remains Dull</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and strong at noon, with a slightly softer trend. This is because the financial situation is extremely tight, the actual demand has not been smooth, and the year-end is approaching, so the various gangs have no excitement, so the market situation is still dull. However, the Sichuan gang's purchase volume is still healthy.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Prices Retrace After Falling: The exchange staff opened the market before the bidding. Due to the closure of the U.S. cotton market, there were very few transactions in the market. Moreover, this month was hit by the financial crisis, falling 1 liang 2 qian. The distant month fell 2.45 qian. In the afternoon, those who profited this month covered their short positions, rising 1 liang, and the distant month rose 3.4 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,100 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 1,950 bales, and Senkang sold 450 bales. Jifeng bought 900 bales, Tianlong bought 650 bales, Shenji bought 650 bales, and Dachang bought 600 bales. The closing prices of the bidding are listed on the left.</p>

<p>February 1529 rose 161,200 May 1540 fell 221,850</p>
<h3>Sichuan is the Most Active in Spot Yarn Sales: Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that the total number of purchases by various gangs throughout the day was 1,700 bales. 25 bales were purchased by peers. The market was average. 950 bales were purchased by the Sichuan gang, 35 bales by the Ningbo gang, 45 bales by the Changsha gang, 125 bales by the inland gang, 105 bales by the Guangdong gang, 250 bales by the Yunnan gang, 50 bales by the Henan gang, and 55 bales by other gangs.</h3>
<h3>Recent Cotton Prices Surge by More Than Half a Liang</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm. This month, due to the Ningbo gang receiving goods, shipping them to Yongdi for delivery, the standard price suddenly rose by 5.5 qian, and the distant months were also lifted. However, the actual sales factories did not ask about it, because foreign cotton is cheap, so there is no need to buy local cotton again. However, the Han gang and the inland gangs have a very strong bullish mentality and have been holding on tightly from beginning to end, so it is difficult to be bearish for the time being.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Yong Gang Received Goods This Month: The exchange Han Standard opened in the morning. The US and Indian cotton markets were closed for Christmas. The market atmosphere in the market was average. There was no rise or fall in each month. In the afternoon, the current month was received by the Yong gang, rising by 5.5 qian alone, and the distant month rose by 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 71,600 dan. It was found that Yudai sold 1,000 dan, Yichang sold 2,500 dan, Yuandai sold 2,200 dan, Shenchang sold 2,600 dan, Hengde sold 2,400 dan, and Rongxing sold 1,400 dan. Tianlong bought 4,400 dan, Changfeng bought 1,100 dan, Yiyu bought 1,200 dan, Jifeng bought 1,400 dan, and Gongtai bought 2,000 dan. The closing prices of the Han standard are listed on the left.</p>

<p>February 3200 5 178,200 May 3260 5 92,500</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Arrivals and Sales Are Both Quiet: There were no spot cotton transactions at all, and the source of supply was also cut off.</p>
<h3>US Cotton is Expected to Turn Around After the New Year</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 24th reported on the cotton market in the past week. The cotton market was slightly firmer last week. Industry purchases were sufficient to absorb the South's selling. In terms of the overall market trend, everyone is uncertain as the New Year approaches, but there is an optimistic potential that the worst period has passed and a turnaround can be seen in the New Year. Moreover, the world's cotton inventory will be depleted due to limited sales in the past two years. However, public confidence must recover slowly after this unprecedented pressure. Moreover, the ultimate basis for cotton prices still depends on whether the cotton fields can be sharply reduced next season. At the same time, the legislative proposals in the winter parliament regarding agricultural relief have not been confirmed, and the new cotton planting season is approaching. The hoarding movement in the South may transform into softening.</p>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Sparse Arrivals and Active Sales in the Hexia Rice Market</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the source of supply from various gangs suddenly became sluggish. About a dozen warehouses had weak inventories. The retail sales of urban and rural stores have been low for a long time, so they are still active, and transactions have become more concentrated. It is not easy for the thick Xinjing rice market to become firmer, because the year-end is approaching and the money supply is tight. There are fewer thin-rice arrivals every day. The price of slightly better-quality rice on this street has increased. Arrivals of foreign Dujian rice are sparse, and the appetite is turning active. The shape is挺秀. The accumulated inventory of the metamorphic yuan rice still has retail sales, which are still small. The alcohol appetite is not good, and the price has been reduced by another five fen.</p>
<p>Xinzha: 30 to 40 boats arrived. The market sales are旺 due to the bad weather. The buying interest from all parties is very strong. The prices of the two types of Xixin thin rice were raised by 1 jiao each. Foreign Dujian rice is sold as soon as it arrives, and the situation continues to be 挺. The Lingyu appetite of Tongjin rice is quiet and happy. The alcohol appetite of the metamorphic two yuan is寥寥, so the price has fallen by several fen. There are about 4,000 shi of Hexia 斛脚.</p>
<h3>Various Gangs Continue to Sell Spot Small Rice</h3>
<p>Price Increase of 1 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign rice market, the foreign banks were closed for the holidays, and the prices of returned goods were 喴高. Although there were no transactions in the market, people's hearts were looking forward to it. Spot sales were still good, because in addition to inquiries on this street, the Tianjin Yantai and other Beiyang gangs and the Hankou gang along the Yangtze River continued to try to do business, and the market price immediately rose by 1 jiao. A total of 3,000 bags of small-rice rice were transacted in the market, priced at 9 yuan and a half, 9 yuan and 4 jiao to 9 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>December 期粉 Delivery Situation</h3>
<p>Total Amount of Only 59,000 Bags</p>
<p>Major Factories All Withdrew in Advance</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for December 期粉. The total delivery amount for the day was said to be 59,000 bags, including 27,000 bags of Huafeng's Green Wheat Root and 32,000 bags of Tailong's Green Teng Ball. The flour from the Fu and Fu factories was all withdrawn by the客帮 in advance. The flour from factories such as Shenda, Xinda, and Xiangxin was also not delivered due to good spot sales. If there are inquiries from 客销 within the next few days of the year, there will be spot flour in the market, otherwise, the closing standard will prevail.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Market Sentiment Turns Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no new dispatches from the sugar production areas to the sugar market. The clearing of accounts in the guild market was quiet due to it being Saturday. However, market sentiment was generally firm. Dutch sugar number 24 coarse sand white was bid at taels 9.65, then a few transactions were made at taels 9.6. There was a shortage of supply from producers. Dutch refined white sugar was taels 11.3, number 20 medium-grain white sugar taels 9.55, fine-ground white sugar taels 9.725 to 9.75, and Dutch red sugar number 8 taels 8.35. The market situation was generally stable and strong. Taikoo Sugar's China New Company offered over a hundred bags of CW mark at taels 11.65, B mark at taels 11.775 to 11.75, and DY mark bid at taels 11.7, with few takers. HX mark was at taels 11.55. Both buying and selling were slack, and the market seemed stable.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The Nearing End of the Woolen Cloth Market</p>
<p>As the year draws to a close, the woolen cloth trade is gradually cooling down. The guild market situation is very quiet, as both buyers and sellers have mostly finished their accounting and wrapping up. In previous years, the woolen cloth business would have a major closing at the end of the lunar year. This year, the closing is earlier, mainly because most are following the Gregorian calendar. Also, the current market is unstable and financing is extremely tight. Therefore, although there are some sporadic transactions, most are cash on delivery or paid by check. There are very few transactions with promissory notes. The industry plans to settle outstanding accounts by the end of this month. However, for those with money houses, it will be settled by the end of January, according to the Chamber of Commerce notice. The accounts of tailors and seamstresses are unlikely to be collected by the end of January. Yesterday, Saturday, trading in the Tongyi Guild market was very sparse, and prices were falling rather than rising. The difference between open and hidden bids was significant, a rare occurrence in recent years. Yesterday, except for various plain and mixed-color broadcloths, other items such as straight tribute cloth, Walter cloth, fancy cloth, covert cloth, melton cloth, and raincoat fabric were all being sold at lower prices. Plain thick cloth and overcoat cloth showed a particularly sharp decline.</p>
<h3>Metals: Approaching Peak Season But Sluggish Market Shows Signs of Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market remained mediocre due to limited sales and weak demand from merchants. However, the arrival of goods was extensive, so the market showed signs of further weakness. Recently, there has been little hope for business improvement within the year for items such as plain galvanized iron, tinplate, pig lead, English steel plate, garden lead wire, and black iron sheet.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet: Two to Three Thousand Loads Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Black iron sheet, which was popular for a time, had a fresh arrival of two to three thousand loads in foreign warehouses yesterday, according to news. Most were 2'x6', while 3'x6' sheets were mostly 12 or 13 sheets per load. It is said that there was a limited amount of heavy-gauge colored sheets.</p>
<h3>Coal: Large Shipment of Shanxi Coal to Arrive</h3>
<p>Shanxi white coal prices have been steadily increasing due to limited supply, rising from 19 taels to over 21 taels per ton. Therefore, various local firms are procuring from Tianjin. It is now known that over seven thousand tons will be shipped. Yesterday, news from Tianjin stated that three thousand five hundred tons had been shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon. If the goods arrive completely, the market may change slightly.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Seven Thousand Bales of American Cotton Shipped from New York</h3>
<p>Five thousand pieces of paper shipped to North China.</p>
<p>Seven hundred cases of milk shipped from England.</p>
<p>Six thousand six hundred pieces of steel shipped from Belgium.</p>

<p>Come to Shanghai to Urge Sun Ke</p>
<p>Sun Expresses Coming to Shanghai to Promote Unity Among Comrades</p>
<p>Hopes Hu, Wang, and Jiang Will All Go to Beijing to Preside</p>
<p>Since Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and others suddenly left Beijing and came to Shanghai, the political atmosphere has become tense again. Yesterday, cars and horses crowded in front of Sun’s residence on Molihre Road. The conference specially dispatched envoys Jiang Zuobin, Chen Mingshu, Zou Lu, and others to come to Shanghai to urge him to return quickly. Sun himself issued a statement yesterday regarding his departure from Beijing and his future opinions. The news from yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Visits Sun After Sun Ke and others left Beijing,</h3>
<p>the First Central Committee immediately held a discussion meeting that afternoon, deciding to first send Jiang Zuobin to Shanghai to explain. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Jiang visited Sun at 10:30 AM, talking for about an hour. Sun has not yet made a definitive statement on the issue of going to Beijing. Jiang returned to Beijing at 3:15 PM to report back.</p>
<h3>Banquet for Li Jishen Li Jishen, a member of the Guangdong Committee remaining in Shanghai,</h3>
<p>Li Zongren, Zhang Huichang, Chen Ce, Lin Yunga, Huang Shaoxiong, and others visited Sun’s residence yesterday morning one after another, asking in detail about the situation of the disputes. Sun prepared a meal at his residence, hosting a banquet for Li Jishen and others, which did not end until about 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Telegraph to Hong Kong and Guangdong Sun Ke telegraphed</h3>
<p>Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong, Chen Jitang and Xiao Focheng in Guangzhou, and others yesterday morning, reporting the details of the First Central Committee disputes.</p>
<h3>Chen and Zou's Talk Chen Mingshu, acting head of the Executive Yuan, and Zou Lu, a member of the Central Committee,</h3>
<p>were sent by the remaining members of the Central Committee in Beijing to come to Shanghai on the 12:30 PM train yesterday to urge Sun to return. They arrived here at 7:45 PM yesterday. The reporter went to meet them on the train. According to Zou Lu, the matter is not a major problem. He is only participating in the talks in a personal capacity. The various members of the Central Committee in Beijing have drafted a solution that can achieve a satisfactory resolution. The content of the solution cannot be disclosed yet, but it will likely be decided after they meet with Sun. The reporter also inquired with Chen, but Chen declined to express his opinion, answering roughly the same as Zou. Chen and Zou visited Sun once after arriving in Shanghai, leaving after a short talk. It is said that they will urge Sun to return again today.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Visits Wang Sun Zhesheng made an important statement regarding</h3>
<p>his visit to Shanghai this time, expressing his attitude. After dinner, he personally visited Wang at Dr. Noehr's Hospital on Avenue Joffre, discussing the situation in Beijing and expressing concern for Wang’s illness.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Statement Yesterday, through the introduction of a certain member of the Central Committee,</h3>
<p>the reporter had an audience with Sun. Sun made a very candid statement, which is recorded below. (Reporter asked) What is the reason for your sudden departure from Beijing this time? Can you tell me? (Answer) My entry into Beijing this time was entirely based on the spirit of sincere unity and facing the national crisis together, hoping that the full meeting would bring an end to all previous party affairs and political disputes. Everyone should adopt the meaning of "dying yesterday and being born today," be open and honest, and unite anew, so that we can create a new life for the party and the country to seek a solution to the national crisis and satisfy the people's desires. However, since entering Beijing, I have been bedridden with illness for four or five days and have been unable to meet with my comrades to discuss matters in detail. However, the comrades I have met have all expressed the same feeling, and it is fortunate that the unification of the party and the country is now at hand, and the national vitality will arise from this. On the 24th of this month, I recovered from my illness. On that day, I was elected chairman of the first meeting. When the reform plan of the central political system was discussed, a certain member of the Central Committee, who is a big name, actually made many strange and bizarre remarks, doing his best to provoke discord. Fortunately, very few agreed, and the public ignored it. The second meeting continued yesterday, and I also attended. When the proposal of Comrade Yan Xishan and others to increase the allocation of 100,000 crack troops to defend Jinzhou was discussed, a certain member of the Central Committee again complained greatly, implicitly accusing the comrades from Guangdong who advocated punishing Zhang Xueliang of being traitors who sold out the country. This was not only seen in the remarks but also in the telegram sent to Zhang Xueliang. His malicious slander and intentional injury are certainly despicable. Moreover, at the First Central Committee meeting, which is the lifeline of the party and the country, how should those attending put aside their emotions and discuss matters openly? Yet, they regard their comrades as enemies and traitors. Is there any hope for the future of the party? Seeing this situation, I deeply feel that if such erroneous ideas in the party members are not corrected, there will never be any hope of unity. Therefore, after thinking it over again and again, the only option is to leave Beijing, regardless of causing another dispute within the party again because of this time. (Reporter asked) What are your future suggestions for remedying party affairs? (Answer) I have always advocated that only sincere unity can solve the problem of party affairs. However, I regret that my words are insignificant and not understood by many comrades. In 1927, I advocated cooperation between Ning, Han, and Shanghai to form a special committee, but it failed due to opposition from some comrades. In 1928, I telegraphed the central government from overseas, advocating cooperation between Hu, Wang, and Jiang, but it was also obstructed and could not be realized. The Extraordinary Conference was established this year, based on the principle of sincere unity and no factionalism, to achieve the goal of overthrowing dictatorship and unifying the party. It has already achieved considerable success. In the future, we should continue to proceed according to this principle. Now that the national crisis is getting deeper, we must unite as one to deal with foreign enemies. However, there are still some comrades who do not understand this principle and are obsessing over old accounts and using emotions. I am of meager talent and unable to persuade my comrades, and I am deeply ashamed. I only hope that Mr. Hu, Wang, and Jiang can put aside everything at this time and come to Beijing together. These three gentlemen all have special status in the party and are respected by party members from all sides. If they can meet and discuss, everything will be easily resolved. As for the past merits, demerits, rights, and wrongs, Mr. Jiang has already resigned to take responsibility, and I think it can be brought to an end. For the sake of the party and the country, at this time, we must work hard to develop a new situation. Everything in the past is like dying yesterday, and everything in the future is the beginning. The survival and honor of the party and the country are truly tied to this. I hope these three gentlemen can act quickly and resolutely to resolve the national crisis. If all three gentlemen can come together, I will do my best to follow them. Otherwise, if my strength is not enough to fulfill my wishes and I cannot save the situation, I will only temporarily not ask about party affairs.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Others</h3>
<p>Have Agreed to Go to Beijing Today</p>
<p>Chen and Zou Hold Letters from Various Committees in Beijing Urging Him to Return</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, members of the Central Committee Sun Ke and Li Wenfan left Beijing for Shanghai the day before yesterday due to certain matters. Yesterday, various members of the Central Committee in Beijing specially sent Chen Mingshu and Zou Lu to Shanghai with letters, urging them to return to Beijing immediately to discuss important matters together. Chen and Zou arrived in Shanghai at about 8 PM yesterday and visited Sun at his residence on Molihre Road, leaving at 10 PM. It is said that Sun has agreed to take a special train to Beijing at 3 PM today (December 27th) with Li Wenfan and the members of the Central Committee from Guangdong, Li Renchao, Li Zongren, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, and others to fulfill the mission of the Fourth First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The original letter from Lin Sen and other members of the Central Committee in Beijing to Sun is recorded below:</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhesheng, Upon first hearing of your departure from the capital, we were deeply alarmed. Then, hearing that you would be coming within a day or two, the public was comforted. This time, you have resolutely taken on the heavy responsibility of the country, and all citizens deeply admire you. Moreover, who among the comrades who have long shared hardships would not be willing to open their hearts to help you?

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Resigns as</h3>
<p>Director of the Municipal Party Committee and Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Frequent Labor and Business Disputes</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with Handling</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Committee and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the Central Committee yesterday requesting to resign from his position as a member of the Municipal Executive Committee and sent a letter to the Municipal Party Committee for review. At the same time, he submitted a request to Mayor Zhang to resign from his substantive position as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau to recuperate. His telegram is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Central Committee To the Organization Department of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>transferred to the Central Executive Committee, Pan Gongzhan has been mistakenly in charge of the Shanghai municipal party affairs for nearly four years. Usually, due to holding both political affairs positions, he has put in less effort. Upon introspection, he feels deeply indebted. Since the Shenyang Incident, the pressure of foreign troubles has led to a surge of student movements. Guidance and persuasion have all failed. Even the party headquarters has been destroyed, and blame has been placed on him. Pan Gongzhan has followed the overall executive and supervisory committee members of the city in requesting a general resignation, but has not yet received instructions. In the past half-month, the party affairs disputes have been increasing day by day, and the abnormal organization cannot be investigated. He believes that while the Central Committee is celebrating unity, this city is showing division. If this continues, it will be like suicide. Moreover, in the business and labor sectors, the storms have suddenly risen, with one side fighting the other, and there is no peace. The breakdown of organizations and the mutual disputes between labor and management, at a time when the effectiveness of the law has lost its authority, are inevitably bound to happen. At this time of internal and external troubles, how can we bear to see this disintegration? He believes that he is weak and unable to turn the tide. He dares to pour out his innermost feelings and begs the conference to grant him permission to resign from his position as a member of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, so as to avoid further mistakes and relieve the burden. He cannot help but await orders in fear. Furthermore, from this day on, Pan Gongzhan will no longer be responsible for the Shanghai municipal party affairs. In the future, in his spare time, he will still contribute his humble suggestions as a party member for selection and will never dare to be lazy and idle. This is combined and clarified. Pan Gongzhan bows, You.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Mayor Regarding resignation, Pan</h3>
<p>Gongzhan has been mistakenly in charge of the bureau affairs for more than four years. Fortunately, with the instructions of Your Excellency and the support of society, the construction projects have been able to proceed in an orderly manner, and the statistical work has achieved a considerable position. Usually, he has followed the laws in mediating labor-management disputes and reorganizing various organizations to gradually stabilize social order and eliminate the gap between business and labor. Now, although all facilities are roughly in place, his weak body and mind are already exhausted. Unexpectedly, recently, storms have suddenly risen in the Shanghai business and labor sectors, and what has been gradually brought into order over the years will be destroyed without remainder. He believes that he is weak, and future governance will not be possible. Therefore, he dares to pour out his innermost feelings and begs Your Excellency to examine and approve his resignation from his substantive position and quickly select personnel to take over so as to recuperate and avoid further mistakes. He cannot help but await orders in gratitude. Respectfully presented to Mayor Zhang.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Clashed Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Both Sides Injured</p>
<p>The dispute among workers at the printing plant of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, the details of which were recorded in yesterday's newspaper, occurred again yesterday morning. Both sides were beaten and injured, and both were sent to the hospital for treatment. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Course of the Conflict After the dispute occurred</h3>
<p>in the Commercial Press the afternoon before yesterday, workers Huang Rongqing, Hu Jinshan, Bao Yongde, Bao Achang, Li Yiqing, Jiang Guoli, Che Qu Xian, Xu Tongkang, and others were detained by the military police and temporarily held in the military police group joint office of the Huzhou Guild Hall on Huiwen Road, Zhabei. Yesterday morning, the publishing industry workers' union reorganization committee prepared an official letter and went to inquire. They learned that the detained workers had been taken by the Fifth District Public Security Bureau to the military police group office. At 8 AM, when the printing plant of the Commercial Press started work, representatives of the workers heard that Hou Dachun, Wang Changyuan, and others wanted to convene a meeting in the factory. The entire group rushed to the union and clashed with the security team. Union supervisors Hou Dachun, Wang Changyuan, and Yan Yongquan were severely beaten and injured. Workers Zhang Wenkui, Feng Chenggen, Xu Amao, Luo Dazhi, Ni Dalin, Han Daocheng, Huang Chang Er, and others were also injured. Hou Dachun and Wang Changyuan were sent to Baolong Hospital by car, and Yan Yongquan was sent to Jisheng Hospital by car. The remaining injured workers were treated at Tongren Hospital. Hou and Wang were injured in the head, and their conditions were serious. Yan's injuries were also very critical.</p>
<h3>Arrested and Sent to Court When the conflict occurred between the two sides</h3>
<p>yesterday morning, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, led by Inspector Gao, dispatched police to suppress the situation and detained workers Wang Bin, Wu Youfu, Li Nanqin, Wu Chengshi, Sun Abing, Qiao Zhonghe, Qian Tingliang, Zhao Guisheng, and others at the district office. At about 1 PM, together with Huang Rongqing, Hu Jinshan, and others who were taken from the military police group joint office, they were sent to the local court. Those who were injured and treated in the hospital were summoned by the court.</p>
<h3>What Was Heard After the Incident After the workers' dispute occurred</h3>
<p>at the Commercial Press, various sectors paid close attention. It was heard that someone had mediated in order to avoid expanding the storm. The publishing industry workers' union reorganization committee also submitted reports to the municipal government, the garrison headquarters, and the municipal party headquarters, requesting punishment for the perpetrators and informing the workers to work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the publishing industry workers' union issued a responsible report stating that a few members of the municipal party committee colluded with undesirable elements of the Commercial Press branch to hold an extraordinary meeting and illegally produced a workers' delegation. The union submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau and the municipal party committee to ban it. Later, according to the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau, permission was granted for the ban. However, the municipal party committee shielded the workers' delegation and ignored the request. As for stopping activities and sending personnel to reorganize, all were members of the workers' delegation. Now, due to the joint proclamation of the municipal government and the garrison headquarters banning illegal organizations, the delegation should be illegal. Therefore, it will not be accepted. The report was submitted to the Central Government for thorough investigation and to await resolution quietly.</p>
<h3>British-Owned Public Buses</h3>
<p>Completely Stopped Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers Went from Slowdown to Actual Strike</p>
<p>Company Announcement Limits Registration to Today</p>
<p>Attack on Staff and Destruction of Vehicles Occurred Yesterday</p>
<p>After a slowdown by all ticket sellers of the British-owned public bus company, yesterday it turned into an actual strike, and buses on all routes completely stopped. The company issued an announcement limiting registration to today, or else the job will be terminated. There were also incidents of assaulting staff and destroying vehicles. The various situations are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Traffic In order to maintain traffic, the</h3>
<p>company had ticket checkers and others act as agents in the morning to force operation. Route 1, Jing’an Temple to the shooting range, was shortened to Old Shooting Range Road, operating 14 buses. Route 9, Jing’an Temple to the power plant, was shortened to Tilanqiao, operating 10 buses. Later, because striking workers used force to stop it, the police, in order to prevent accidents, ordered the company to temporarily stop driving. As a result, the one-nine buses that had been operating in the morning all stopped operating.</p>
<h3>Assaulting Staff At 10 AM yesterday morning, ticket seller number</h3>
<p>141, Cheng Tingliang, was working on the 9th route bus, driving to the intersection of Hart Road and Avenue Foch, when he was discovered by striking ticket sellers. They regarded him as disrupting strike discipline and dragged Cheng to the middle of the road, throwing lime bags at him, resulting in his injury. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road by the police. It was heard that he had lost his sight. At 12:15 PM, the number 80 bus driver was suspected by striking workers of secretly guaranteeing the ticket checkers in the company and was beaten by the crowd in the company. Mr. Dan, a Western staff member of the company, tried to persuade them, but he was slightly injured. The glass of a route 1 bus was also smashed while driving on Jing’an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Workers' Meeting After all striking ticket sellers</h3>
<p>petitioned Yao Zengmo, the Chinese chief inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the day before yesterday, they held a discussion meeting in front of the company on Connaught Road yesterday morning. It was heard that the result of the discussion was: (1) If ticket seller number 1 is not released, all will be willing to be the backing and insist on continuing the slowdown; (2) Those who disrupt discipline will be dealt with severely.</p>

Passengers felt quite inconvenienced. As a result, trams were very crowded, and rickshaws were three times as profitable.</p>
<h3>Company Announcement The British-owned public bus company</h3>
<p>announced yesterday: For the matter of the announcement, ticket seller number 1 of this company has been arrested for inciting a strike and will be punished by the police in accordance with the laws of the Republic of China. Starting tomorrow (December 27, 1931), all employees who do not report to work at this company will have their positions terminated by this company, and they must return their uniforms and other items to receive their wages.</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Labor and Management Ticket sellers told the New Voice News Agency reporter yesterday that</h3>
<p>all 280 of us were newly recruited by the company, and our monthly salary is 23 yuan. Usually, the company oppresses workers quite a lot. If we do not jump the red card or open the door before arriving at the station, we will be recorded, and after three major mistakes, we will be dismissed. This time, it was purely to help ticket seller number 1. If he is not released for one day, then we will not return to work for one day. According to company news, they plan to follow the previous method of the old ticket sellers' strike. If they do not return to work today, they will all be dismissed and new workers will be hired to continue working.</p>
<h3>The Illness of Central Committee Member Cai Yuanpei</h3>
<p>Was Hospitalized Yesterday to Treat Arm Injury</p>
<p>Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei was injured in the student petition conflict at the Central Party Headquarters. After being treated at the Central Hospital in Nanjing for a few days, he moved to Shanghai and was treated at his residence. Initially, his injuries were only swelling and redness in his arm and bruises on his back, which did not seem very serious. With slight recuperation and treatment, he should have recovered soon. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, the pain in his arm worsened, and it was difficult to extend and flex it. The bruises on his back had not subsided either. After a medical examination by Dr. Bei, it was said that there might be a fracture in the bones of his right arm. If it is not treated quickly, there will be future problems. Therefore, he was moved to a certain hospital yesterday to use X-rays to examine the inside of his arm injury and give fundamental treatment. According to Cai's family member who is caring for him, Cai is in good spirits while ill. However, he is old, and he still feels dizzy from being hit on the head. The bruises on his arms and back make it difficult for him to move. Doctors have forbidden him from reading books, so his newspapers are read aloud to him by his caregivers. Although he is very concerned about the recent situation and the national crisis, he does not seem to want to be too involved in actual politics.</p>

<h3>Niu Yongjian Resigns and Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Niu Tiesheng, Minister of the Bureau of Evaluation of the Examination Yuan, resigned from his substantive position because he was better at military affairs and did not want to engage in the literary battle. The Eastern Province was lost, and difficulties were imminent. Niu was extremely angry and submitted his resignation to fight against Japan. However, the national government instructed him to stay, which was not approved. It is now known that Niu submitted a second resignation and left Beijing for Shanghai yesterday. He will return to his residence at No. 90 Zhifeng Lane, Huanlong Road, to rest temporarily and will plan with people in Shanghai to coordinate the rescue of the national crisis.</p>
<h3>Yan and Feng Telegraph Wang, Coming to Beijing at the Same Time</h3>

We are waiting for Mr. to arrive in Beijing, and we will set off to come south at the same time. It is heard that Wang also telegraphed Feng and Yan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Pudong Rihua Textile Mill</h3>
<p>Complete Stoppage of Work in the Weaving Room</p>
<p>Japanese Capitalists' Various Oppressions</p>
<p>Increasing Workload, Reducing Wages</p>
<p>Unwarranted Detention of Two Workers</p>
<p>Yesterday's Appeal to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>Reason for the Stoppage: According to Guomin News Agency, the Rihua Textile Mill in Pudong is run by Japanese capitalists. Since the Northeast Incident occurred, and the entire country severed economic ties with Japan, Japanese yarn has been greatly affected. The mill's management has been provoking workers in every way, dismissing hundreds of workers without cause. On the 24th of this month, the management implemented another malicious plan, increasing the workload for all female workers in the weaving room. Those who previously managed three looms are now required to manage four. The wage for each piece of cloth woven, previously 56 cents, has now been reduced to 50 cents. The mill also ordered female collaborators Zhang Fuying and Hu Azhen to force the workers to work. Subsequently, they falsely reported to the police station, leading to the detention of workers Lu Xiaomei and Ni Jinxiu. All the workers, having endured enough, unanimously stopped working and gathered at the union to hold a meeting, demanding: (1) the release of the detained female workers; (2) the reinstatement of the dismissed female workers; (3) the restoration of the original working conditions. The union immediately reported the situation urgently to higher authorities and sent representatives to negotiate. The factory management's attitude was firm, and no progress was made. The unrest is likely to escalate.</p>
<p>Submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs: Regarding the Urgent Report, Since the violent Japanese seized our Eastern Provinces, the cruel capitalists have also taken advantage of the situation, dismissing hundreds of workers without cause. Our association, considering international relations and fearing falling into their trap, has repeatedly endured the pain and reported the situation to your bureau for record. Unexpectedly, on the 24th of this month, the management implemented another malicious plan, intending to dismiss over a hundred more workers in the weaving room, and further increasing the workload while reducing wages. For example, those who usually managed one or two machines will now have to manage three to four. The wage for each piece of cloth, previously 56 cents, will now only be 50 cents. They ordered the female collaborators and foremen Hu Azhen and Zhang Fuying to announce this to the workers and enforce it. The workers, noting that since the opening of the factory, each person has managed at most two machines, and it is physically impossible to manage three or four, and that increasing the workload while reducing wages is unreasonable, believe that the management is intentionally destroying them and oppressing them without cause, which is unacceptable. Therefore, they asked Hu Azhen and others to convey to the management a plea for them to reconsider and withdraw the order. Unexpectedly, Hu Azhen and others not only refused to accept the workers' opinions but also relied on the management's power to insult and scold them, leading to conflicts in language with the workers. They then falsely reported to the Third District Police Station that they had been beaten, resulting in the arrest of workers Lu Xiaomei and Ni Jinxiu, who were sent to the court and have not yet been released. Currently, all 400+ workers in the weaving room, seeing this situation, are filled with righteous indignation. If no appropriate solution is found, they will be forced to resign together. Our association believes this matter is of great importance, so we submit this report to your bureau, requesting that you promptly send representatives to mediate with the management, and also appeal to the local court to immediately release Lu Xiaomei and Ni Jinxiu to avoid injustice and appease public anger. We await your urgent instructions. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>Collective Petition: The New Voice Society reports that all 400+ female workers in the weaving room went to the local court at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday to petition for the immediate release of the arrested female workers. They were received by the clerk, who advised them to disperse and wait for processing. However, the female workers were unwilling to leave and insisted on the release. The female workers Bao Cuidi and Cai Fuzhen were questioned and released, but Chen Xiaomei and Ni Jinxiu were not released because their case involved causing injury through assault. All the female workers were forced to return to the factory temporarily to arrange bail.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Workers: The Rihua Textile Mill announced yesterday morning that it is currently affected by the current situation and the market is declining. To avoid causing suffering to the workers, the mill has tried its best to maintain operations, as the workers know. However, the situation cannot be resolved quickly, and the factory faces extraordinary difficulties. In this transitional period, it is necessary to find ways to improve. Unexpectedly, workers engaged in fighting. Therefore, the following workers who caused the trouble are dismissed: Chen Baoying, Tang Jinda, Lu Xiaomei, Han Xiuzhen, Pan Xiuying, Fu Wenzhen, Ni Jinxiu, Bao Cuidi, Shao A'gen, Cai Xiaomei, and Cai Fuzhen. They must leave the workshop within ten days.</p>
<p>Authorities' Advice: Zhang, the District Chief of the Third District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and armed police officers from the Fourth Company of the Police Brigade went to maintain order. District Chief Zhang, along with staff from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, personally went to advise the female workers: (1) Regarding the arrested female workers, wait for the court to handle it according to law; (2) Regarding the reduction of wages and the increase in the number of machines, wait for the Party and government organs to mediate according to law; (3) Hope that the workers will resume work first. However, the workers insisted on refusing. The union scheduled a general meeting last night to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Yunfu</h3>
<p>Organize a National Salvation Association Aboard Ship</p>
<p>Donate Funds to Support Soldiers</p>
<p>Issue a Declaration</p>
<p>On December 1st, there were over 200 overseas Chinese passengers on the Blue Funnel Line's Chindara, which departed from Hobart. Daily radio messages from the ship reported that the Japanese invaders were plundering our country and slaughtering our compatriots with increasing ferocity. Upon hearing the news, the overseas Chinese were filled with righteous indignation and wanted to annihilate the Japanese before eating. They proposed organizing a National Salvation Association to resist Japan and unify their will. Temporary officers were elected, including: Chairman Huang Lanrui, Secretaries Shi Qifeng, Huang Shizhou, Yu Linghe, Wen Jiliang Hong, Treasurers Tan Yangzhao, Huang Gonglou, Propagandists Huang Bobo, Wu Shihe, Yu Jinghe, Yang Zhang, Cai Hong, Situ Da, Yu Qichang, Disciplinarians Huang Gongce, Zheng Zanxian, Luo Niande, Li Lin, Liu Yong, Huang Hua, General Affairs Wu Yuechuan, Li Yu, and Receptionists Yu Zhaozhong, Chen Rongcong, Tang Yizuo. They immediately divided into departments to handle affairs and drafted a declaration to resist Japan. They chose 8 p.m. on the 15th to hold the inaugural meeting. At that time, except for a few who did not know what the country was, everyone enthusiastically attended. The meeting order was: (1) Shi Qifeng, as the master of ceremonies, led the audience to stand and bow three times to the national flag; (2) The entire audience observed three minutes of silence to mourn the compatriots who died in the Northeast; (3) The chairman was invited to take his seat and announce the reasons for the meeting; (4) Speeches were given by the ship's doctor, Zeng Ziming, the ship's compradore, Liang Hong, as well as Situ Da, Huang Bobo, Wu Shihe, Yang Zhang, Huang Shizhou, Yu Linghe, Luo Niande, Zheng Zanxian, Yu Qichang, Huang Gongce, and Shi Qifeng. Dr. Zeng explained the reasons for the loss of the Northeast and the Japanese plans for our country in the future, and encouraged compatriots to make a great determination to resist Japan to the end. Liang Hong announced the intense anti-Japanese movements in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the losses suffered by industry and commerce since China's unified economic severance with Japan. Huang Bobo strongly criticized the lack of responsibility of the Chinese people, their shirking of responsibility when things happen, and their fondness for making meaningless criticisms as the biggest weaknesses. If we want to save the country, we must correct our past mistakes, understand our responsibilities, and earnestly shoulder them. He also played a military-style harmonica, which was慷慨激昂. The patriotic atmosphere throughout the meeting was extremely tense. The others all gave encouraging speeches. After each speech, applause thundered. (5) Anti-Japanese regulations were approved: (A) No one should land at any Japanese port; (B) No one should buy Japanese goods; (C) Telegraph to reject Japan; (6) Slogans were shouted: (1) Down with Japanese imperialism; (2) Abolish unequal treaties; (3) Economic severance with Japan; (4) Promote peaceful unification; (5) Long live the success of resisting Japan and saving the country; (6) Long live the Republic of China; (7) Yu Qichang thanked the guests; (8) The meeting adjourned. On the 19th, the ship arrived in Yokohama, and on the 21st, it arrived in Kobe. The disciplinarians strictly monitored, and no passenger landed or traded with the Japanese. The Kobe Chinese Association sent several copies of the Shen Bao newspaper. It was learned that General Ma Zhanshan's brave soldiers were fiercely fighting the Japanese in the frozen lands. Many domestic groups were vying to raise funds to support them. Everyone believed that it was the undeniable responsibility of all citizens. Therefore, they launched another fundraising campaign to慰勞 the soldiers at the front. First, the ship's compradore, Liang Hong, generously donated 56 yuan. Then, the passengers were asked to donate freely. A total of 145 yuan and 32 yuan and 6.5 cents were raised. The funds were directly remitted to General Ma Zhanshan through the Shanghai Bank of Communications, and the names of the donors were published in the Shanghai Shen Bao newspaper for one day to show good faith. According to investigations, the commercial and industrial conditions of various Japanese ports along the coast have plummeted due to the boycott by our country. In Yokohama, 80% of the Chinese residents have returned to China. The Chinese district is now deserted. After 8 p.m., there are no pedestrians on the streets. In Kobe, all Chinese-run businesses have completely shut down. After waiting a few days to complete the liquidation, they will pack their bags and return home. This is truly an unprecedented phenomenon. The hearts of the people have not died; can the Japanese bandits not be destroyed? Declaration of the National Salvation Association of Overseas Chinese Returning from Blue Funnel Line's Chindara: China is the China of the Chinese people. Any nation in the world, regardless of size or strength, must be able to maintain the sacred sovereignty and territory of its country in order to be called a country. Otherwise, it is merely a colony; in short, it is a slave. Our Chinese nation has a history of over 4,000 years and is a pioneer in world civilization. Due to its inherent simple customs and benevolence towards people and things, it has often been taken advantage of by foreign tribes. The Manchus invaded the Central Plains and implemented a poisonous policy of愚民, and our people groaned under the despotic iron hoof for over 200 years, almost becoming weak and helpless. Fortunately, heaven helped China, and the revolution succeeded. We could have worked hard to govern well, but unfortunately, the hearts of the people were not awakened, leading to strongmen stealing the country and foreign invasions coming one after another. Like a bolt from the blue, the Japanese invaded and occupied our Northeast, killing our compatriots and creating an unprecedentedly tragic history for mankind, committing a great injustice to world peace. Compatriots, the Japanese have already shown their hideous faces and are coming to devour us. Can the people of all of China endure this? Our ancestors preserved the integrity of the land and independent sovereignty with iron and blood and handed it over to us. Are we going to be submissive, allowing ourselves to be slaughtered, and hand over a dog-like slave's humble servitude to our descendants? Are we not human? Compatriots, please rise up quickly, stand together under the banner of resisting Japan and saving the country, and vow to use the united strength of the entire nation to preserve the integrity of the land and the independent sovereignty that our ancestors handed over to us. As the saying goes, "Better to be a shattered piece of jade than a whole tile." Only by being able to die on the battlefield and flatten the Japanese islands can we be considered iron-blooded men. Even if we are pierced by bullets and dismembered by knives and spears, we are defending the country, and only then can we be considered worthy descendants of our ancestors. Today, as we arrive in Japan, it is like enemies meeting, and our eyes are especially clear. We regret that the time has not yet come to kill them all and avenge our compatriots who died in the Northeast. However, at the very least, we must vigorously implement economic severance. Therefore, we have organized a National Salvation Association, firstly to express the great determination of the passengers and crew on this ship to resist Japan, and secondly to support the anti-Japanese associations at home and abroad. All our compatriots should share the enemy's hatred and observe the anti-Japanese regulations approved by this association. If there are any who betray their own kind, recognize thieves as their fathers, and dare to trade with the Japanese, this association will treat them with appropriate civilized means. Everyone should cherish themselves. This declaration is hereby made. December 14th, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers on the Beijing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>Telegraph Urges Jiang, Wang, and Hu to Attend the Plenary Session</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Unions on the Beijing-Shanghai Line telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Executive Committee, stating: Urgent. To the Honorable Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Executive Committee in Nanjing: With the foreign invasion becoming increasingly urgent, our Party leaders are holding the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Executive Committee in accordance with the resolutions of the meeting to jointly face the national crisis. However, Jiang has returned to Ningbo, Wang is滞留 in Shanghai, and Hu remains in Hong Kong, causing the plenary session to lose its center of gravity. What is the meaning of so-called "sincere unity"? Our leaders have always placed national affairs first, and at a time when national affairs are more important than ever, their procrastination is not understood by the public. We earnestly request the General Assembly to telegraph and urge the three members, Jiang, Wang, and Hu, to immediately go to Nanjing to attend the meeting and jointly bear the responsibility for national affairs. Before the three members attend, the General Assembly must not close, in order to promote genuine unity and save the desperate situation. The telegraph ends with choking sobs and unbearable anticipation. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Nanjing Postal Workers' Union, Zhenjiang Postal Workers' Union, Suzhou Postal Workers' Union, Wuxi Postal Workers' Union, Changzhou Postal Workers' Union, etc., along with over 10,000 postal workers on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, respectfully report. Sincerely.</p>

<p>The Minzhi Association telegraphed Li Xiehe, stating: To Honorable Mr. Xiehe and all the gentlemen, we deeply admire your proposal on the four items at the First Plenary Session of the First Central Executive Committee, which concern the fundamental rights of the people and express your loyalty. It has been heard that the meeting passed the first item, and the rest are being discussed together. Upon investigation, only the first item in the proposal is an empty principle, and the most important item is the second item in the proposed case, allowing the people to freely organize groups or political parties. The freedom to form parties is the most important element of democratic politics. Otherwise, if only one party is allowed to exist in a country, acting alone, it will block its ears and obscure its vision and cannot benefit from the effectiveness of others' experiences. The people will also have no way to express their different opinions, and democratic politics will be difficult to achieve. This is the first reason. At a time of chaos, we sincerely hope that the entire nation, from top to bottom, will work together to build up its strength. To achieve this goal, the only way is to allow the people to freely organize political groups, from small combinations to form large combinations, in order to gather the flow of all people and jointly face the national crisis. This is the second reason. The absence of parties outside the Party has already been broken in fact. The Communist Party and the Third Party exist prominently and are not easily shaken. They either occupy remote areas and establish governments, or they manipulate unions and display resistance. Since it is impossible to eliminate these groups, they are trying to destroy those who use peaceful means for rational organization, forcing them to lose their foothold. This is no less than driving away fish and birds for the sake of the abyss. Thinking of the future, we are shivering. This is the third reason. Your proposition is appropriate and just for both the country and the Party. We earnestly hope that you will continue your efforts and persist in your original proposal. All patriotic people are willing to be your support. Furthermore, the organization of this association takes the business and academic communities as its backbone and advocates using peaceful methods to achieve the goal of exciting democracy. The details of the establishment are fully reported in the Shanghai newspaper. We humbly report and hope for your understanding. The Shanghai People's Rule Association.</p>
<h3>Order in Wuyuan is About to be Restored</h3>
<p>Shanghai Wuyuan Compatriot Association Received a Reply Telegram from the Anhui Provincial Government Yesterday</p>
<p>The Wuyuan Compatriot Association in Shanghai received a reply telegram from the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday, stating: Investigation of the situation of bandits disturbing Wucheng. Previously, according to repeated telegram reports from Division Commander Ruan, we immediately telegraphed to order Brigade Commander Zhang of that division to quickly lead his troops to suppress the bandits. Now, according to the telegram report from Division Commander Hao, the bandits attacked Wucheng, and the police force resisted ineffectively and withdrew from the east gate, resulting in looting. The office has already telegraphed to order Brigade Commander Zhang to lead Wu and Wang's two regiments to return from Raoerdun and pursue north. At the same time, the engineer battalion is on alert in Jingdezhen, and the battalion commander is dispatched to lead two companies of soldiers to Wucheng to restore order. It is also reported in the telegram from Brigade Commander Zhang that, according to the confessions of the farmer bandits, the bandit forces number about 2,000, with 700-800 guns. During the attack on Wucheng, they used ladders to climb the city walls. After capturing the city, they looted and fled back to Haikou. It has been confirmed that Qiaozao has fled south. Order in Wucheng should be restored soon. It is also planned to thoroughly clear out the accumulated bandits in the area east of De and south of Wu in order to alleviate the concerns of southern Anhui. Besides ordering them to actively search and suppress the bandits as soon as possible, we are replying to you. Chen Diaoyuan.</p>

<h3>The Hull of the Dade Ship is Towed to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Entire Ship is Damaged Beyond Use</p>
<p>Towed into the Ruirong Shipyard</p>
<h3>Ship's Hull Enters Dock: The hull of the Dade, a merchant ship of the Dada Company, which was burned in a fire at Qiwang, was left in the Hupu area to deal with the task of recovering the bodies of the deceased passengers and crew members, as the company was salvaging. Now that many bodies have been recovered and successively photographed and collected, the hull of the burnt Dade ship has entered water on the shallow beach of Qiwang. Therefore, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau sent the Daqing ship owner to take the Dahe ship to tow it. The hull of the Dade ship has been brought to Shanghai. Yesterday, the hull of the ship was towed into the Ruirong factory for temporary mooring in order to enter the dock to dismantle the machinery.</h3>
<h3>No Goods Remain: The goods in each cabin of the Dade ship were almost completely burned after the fire. Even the remaining goods at the bottom of the cabin were looted by fishing boats and pirate ships in the area. Therefore, when the hull of the Dade ship was towed back to Shanghai this time, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau sent personnel to inspect the ship and found that there were no remaining goods left at the bottom of each cabin. Even the belongings and luggage left by the passengers and crew members in the cabins had been burned a long time ago. When it was towed back, it was only an empty hull.</h3>
<h3>Machinery Damaged: The extent of damage of this fire on the Dade ship is even greater than the previous fire on the Daji ship. Although the engines and machinery inside the ship were not burned, they have been damaged by the fire. The engine parts have no power to start. Technicians from the Maritime Bureau and the Ruirong factory have determined that the machinery in the Dade ship can no longer be used.</h3>
<h3>Discussing the Aftermath: The Maritime Bureau has decided to convene a board meeting to determine the disposal method for the aftermath of the Dade ship case. Currently, there are only one or two directors in Shanghai, and the rest are not in Shanghai. The Bureau has already issued a notice convening a board meeting. When the directors from various places arrive in Shanghai, they will discuss: (1) the issue of disposing of the Dade ship's hull; (2) the issue of adding new ships to supplement the routes; (3) the issue of providing compensation to the deceased crew members and passengers. At the same time, they have submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to send personnel to Shanghai to inspect the existing scheduled ships to ensure caution.</h3>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>Recent News on the Preparation of the Pudong Water Plant</p>
<p>Re-Creating the Budget and Submitting it to the Government for Approval</p>
<p>To the Honorable Shanghai Municipal Government: The need for tap water in various districts of Pudong for public drinking and fire protection is very urgent. It has been decided to establish a water plant. The Bureau of Public Utilities was ordered to prepare it and immediately drafted a plan and surveyed and determined that the public land at Laiyidu Youlong Road Taoyuanzhai would be the site for the construction of the plant. Recently, it also met with the Land Bureau to purchase the land owned by the Li and Gu families nearby to meet the current layout and the needs of future expansion. Recently, the Bureau also plans to build a water tower on the public land at No. 5 Laiyidu Street (i.e., the current location of the city-run artesian well). An observation deck will be built on the top of the tower, and a business office will be built on the base of the tower, estimated to cost over 30,000 yuan. According to the rapid filtration pool plan originally approved by the Bureau, the water tower was not included in order to save expenses. However, after detailed consideration, it was felt that a small-scale water plant would not be able to average the pressure without a water tower, which would inevitably consume more mechanical power. It is not advisable. Furthermore, the Hutungbang artesian well can also use the tower to store water first for fire protection purposes. Therefore, it was re-submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to add this equipment. However, the total cost of the water plant was originally estimated to be over 160,000 yuan. Now, due to the purchase of land and the addition of a water tower, as well as the increase in the price of machinery and pipes, it will have to increase to 280,000 yuan. It is understood that the Bureau has re-created the budget and submitted it to the Municipal Government. It will be able to start construction next year.</p>
<h3>Owners Self-Install Water Supply Equipment</h3>
<p>Go to the Public Security Bureau to Renew Licenses Quickly</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has registered nearly 500 self-installed water supply equipment by owners in the city. It has been stipulated that the price licenses must be exchanged for new licenses uniformly during the period from December 1 to December 31 each year. Those who have received a license for less than six months will be exchanged for free. Those who have received it for more than six months but less than one year will pay half the fee (50 cents). It is understood that 3/4 of the owners have completed the procedures for renewing their licenses this year. The remaining 1/4 must bring their old licenses and go to the Bureau to exchange for new licenses before the end of this month, December 31. Otherwise, a 20% late fee (50 cents) will be added for each day of delay.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Overview of the Commercial Library in its 20th Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commercial Library has been established for nearly ten years. It has always been open to the public, so people from all walks of life come to the library to read or borrow books for reference. It is greatly welcomed. Now, feeling that shop employees do not have time to come to the library during the day to borrow books, a delivery department has been added since November, delivering books by bicycle every day. Therefore, the library's work is becoming increasingly busy. It is divided into five departments: general affairs, cataloging, cashier, reference, and delivery. According to this year's statistics, 2,246 Chinese books and 318 Western books were added. There are currently 337 kinds of Chinese magazines, with approximately 4,044 copies received throughout the year, 90% of which were donated by various bookstores and institutions. There are a total of 98 kinds of Western magazines, with 1,176 copies received throughout the year, 70% of which were also donated. This year, excluding the relocation of the library, year-end closing, and holidays, the library was open for 277 days throughout the year, with a total of 57,319 visitors, an average of 207 people per day. Due to a lack of statistics, it is estimated that 25,901 copies of daily newspapers were read in the library. 13,760 copies were borrowed from outside the library, an average of approximately 140 copies borrowed per day. The delivery department has 173 borrowers, delivering to an average of 30 locations per day.</p>
<h3>Pig Boats Must First Stop at Wusong for Inspection</h3>
<p>Permits will be issued starting January 1st of next year.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau announced that, in order to protect the health of citizens and eliminate plague-infected meat, the Bureau has established a "Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Pig Boat Inspection and Release Permit." Starting on January 1, 1932, all pig boats passing through Wusong must dock along the riverbank for inspection by the inspectors from the Bureau's Wusong Rendering Plant. If any diseased or dead pigs are found, the dead pigs shall be detained for rendering to prevent clandestine slaughter and sale, and compensation will be given in accordance with regulations to show consideration. If no dead pigs are found, or if dead pigs have already been detained, the aforementioned inspection and release permit will be issued immediately to facilitate commercial transport. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government for record, the Public Security Bureau has been instructed to order the water patrol team to assist at any time. This announcement is hereby made for general information. (December 26, 1931)</p>
<h3>After the Collapse of Yongda Bank</h3>
<p>Shareholders Sue Manager</p>
<p>Accusation of Fraud and Embezzlement</p>
<p>Shareholders Ye Zhensheng and Wu Qizhou of the closed Yongda Bank recently hired lawyer Chao Kun to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing the bank's manager, He Zanxun from Zhejiang, and his cousin, He Yixun (a lawyer and accountant), of breach of trust, fraud, forging documents, and embezzling over 70,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide presided over the preliminary hearing in the Criminal Division Two. He Zanxun was absent. His lawyer appeared in court and stated that he was unable to appear due to illness and requested a postponement. He Yixun also appeared with lawyer E Sen. The plaintiff, Ye Zhensheng, testified that Yongda Bank had a total of six shareholders, with a total capital of 88,000 taels of silver. The defendant, He Zanxun, was the manager. The bank was gradually emptied of over 83,000 taels of silver by He, leading to the bank's sudden collapse on November 7th. However, I was completely unaware of the collapse at the time, as I usually did not go to the bank. All matters were handled by the manager. It was not until the next day, the 8th, that I learned of Yongda's collapse. I immediately tried to find He Zanxun, but he refused to see me. I also learned that all of the bank's account books had been taken away by He Yixun. They were not handed over to accountant Chao Jimei until the 9th, so all of the account books had been falsified. Later, the Yongda Bank accounting staff reported to me that the later entries in the account books were all added at He Zanxun's direction. The second defendant, He Yixun, has no connection with Yongda Bank. How could he directly go to the bank to open the silver safe and take away the account books for falsification? Therefore, I am filing this lawsuit. All the details of Yongda Bank's collapse can only be clarified when He Zanxun appears in court. The defendant, He Yixun, testified that he worked as a lawyer and accountant. On the evening of November 7th, he received a phone call from his cousin, He Zanxun, asking him to go to Yongda Bank to discuss remedies. He went there, and Zanxun told him that the bank was unable to maintain itself because the shareholder Ye Zhensheng had used too much money, and it would inevitably collapse. He asked me to find a way to remedy the situation, but I had no way. It immediately collapsed, and entrusted lawyer Xie Fangling and accountant Chao Jimei to liquidate. The next day, the 8th, Xie and Chao personally went to Yongda Bank and took away the account books. I did not take them away. Accountant Chao Jimei can be summoned to testify about this matter. Judge Feng verified the testimony and ordered the case to be adjourned until the afternoon of January 5th next year for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Riye Bank</h3>
<p>Board of Directors Issue Investigated Again Yesterday</p>
<p>In the case of the collapse of Shanghai Riye Bank Gongfa Company, creditors requested confirmation that Ye Shantao and others were shareholders and held director responsibilities. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhao Zhenhai of the Third High Court opened a hearing again. The official asked lawyer Yan Luqing, the representative of the creditors, whether there were any objections to the statement submitted by the lawyers representing Chen Xingwu, Zhou Songqing, Zhao Qinbo, etc., denying that they were shareholders or directors. Lawyer Yan Luqing replied that his firm had not received a copy and could not respond. Moreover, an investigation revealed that Zhao Qinbo and others were indeed shareholders and directors. How could they deny it? The official then asked whether a formal judgment from the former French Concession court had been served. Yan replied that the judgment of the former French Concession court was written casually, which his firm considered very strange. Subsequently, lawyer Dong Yu stated that his firm also represented creditors who did not accept the ruling of the former French Concession court, requesting confirmation that Ye Shantao and others were shareholders and directors of Gongfa Company, and requesting that the shareholders be ordered to bear the responsibility for prompt repayment. He also unanimously agreed with the former French Concession court's judgment on Huang's living expenses and lawyer Tan Yigong's fees. Lawyers Dong Chi and Bian Jialu, (represented by Huang Cengfu), Wang Shizong, etc., also made the same request. Then, lawyer Yang Zhihao, representing Zhao Qinbo, a director and shareholder of Gongfa Company, stated that Zhao Qinbo had already passed away. His heirs have now appointed my firm to file an appeal against the judgment of the former French Concession court on July 15th, which held Zhao Qinbo liable as a shareholder. An investigation reveals that he was merely a friend of Huang Chujiu and helped out, so he was given a monthly allowance for transportation expenses, but he was not a director. The official asked Zhao Qinbo that, since he was not a shareholder, why was his name on the shareholder list? Lawyer Yang replied that he feared he was fabricated by Huang Chujiu, etc. Lawyer Wu Zhiping, representing Chen Xingwu, Zhou Songqing, etc., disagreed with the former French Concession court's judgment that Chen and Zhou were liable as shareholders. Chen and Zhou were neither shareholders nor directors, and the transportation allowance was merely compensation for their efforts. Lawyer Lu Shaozong, representing Ye Shantao, also denied being a director or shareholder, with roughly the same intent. Lawyer Tan Yigong stated that his firm was entrusted by Huang's family because Huang's property was entirely handed over to the liquidation office, so his firm requested payment of fees from the former French Concession court, which was not unreasonable. Unexpectedly, he was also listed as an appellant by the creditors, which was very perplexing. Lawyer Liu Zuwang, representing Yuan Ludeng, a director and shareholder of Gongfa Company, argued that, although his client was a shareholder and director, the liquidator appointed by the former French Concession court had investigated and confirmed that his client was indeed unable to be responsible for repayment and had issued a ruling exempting him from execution. Since there was already such a ruling, the appeal should be dismissed. By this time, it was dusk. Judge Zhao announced that he would consider the matter further before adjourning the court.</p>

<h3>Confucius Temple Park</h3>
<p>Library to Open on Schedule</p>
<p>Public Education Center to be Built Soon</p>
<p>The Confucius Temple Park, located near the Penglai Market on Confucius Temple Road in the Nanshi district, which includes the Public Education Center and Library, was ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Government in February of this year to be jointly designed and renovated by the Municipal Works Bureau and the Education Bureau, transforming it into an educational park. Recently, most of the construction work in the park has been completed. At the site of the former Minglun Elementary School in the east corner, the Public Education Center is being rebuilt and preparations are being made to begin renovation of the library. The library is scheduled to open on January 10th, and the official opening of the park is expected to be realized by the end of February next year. The construction funds will be allocated from the education funds designated by the Municipal Government. It is reported that the cost of building the library, including construction, is 24,000 yuan, and the total cost of all renovations will be approximately 10,000 yuan. The estimated cost of renovating the Minglun Elementary School under construction is 8,000 yuan. The newly built library is scheduled to open on January 10th, allowing citizens to visit. The Education Bureau recently purchased over 12,000 volumes of ancient and modern books from various bookstores, which are currently being classified and cataloged and will be completed before the opening. The Education Bureau has issued an order to officially open the Confucius Temple by the end of February. The organization of the Public Education Center is divided into the General Affairs Group, which manages accounting, documents, and general affairs; the Lecture Group, which holds various academic and popular lectures; the Editing Group, which edits various popular reading materials and popular illustrations; the Exhibition Group, which exhibits various historical, geographical, natural history, and art models; and the Health Group, which guides the public to pay attention to hygiene and participate in sports activities.</p>
<h3>House Tax and Road Repair Fee Issues</h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association sent the following two letters to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday: (1) Sir, we have received a letter from Chunlai, No. 120 on Fuzhou Road, stating that at 10:00 AM on the 21st of this month, a Westerner from the Public Works Department came to our store to investigate the house ticket, claiming that the house tax could not be levied based on the monthly rent stated on the house ticket and that the house tax must be levied based on an estimated value. It has always been the standard to use the actual rent as the standard. How can it be increased arbitrarily and without limit, which is close to excessive taxation? We are sending this letter to request that the Public Works Department levy the house tax on our store at the original amount. We anxiously await your instructions, etc. The collection of municipal general taxes should be based on the actual rent. Now your bureau arbitrarily increases the rent to collect taxes, which is not proper. In view of the above, we are sending this letter to request that you investigate and correct it immediately. (2) Sir, we have received a letter from Dundacheng, Zhili Road, stating that we have received your letter and know that a section of Zhili Road on Wuxi Road is in disrepair. The Public Works Department has been notified, but the Public Works Department sent workers to repair only a one or two square foot area, and the rest has not yet been started. There are many vehicles entering and exiting this road, and there are often traffic jams. Our company's coal trucks also rely on this road. Because this road is not finished, we are afraid that it will cause trouble. We are sending this letter again to request that you immediately instruct the Public Works Department to speed up the construction, which we deeply hope for, etc. Since this road is an important road for vehicles entering and exiting, in order to avoid accidents, your bureau should immediately order repairs. In view of the above, we are sending this letter to request that you investigate and handle it, and live up to the trust of the taxpayers.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry's Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Administration</h3>
<p>Biaohai Patrol Ship to Undergo Sea Trials Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Pacific News Agency reports that since Han Yougang became the Director of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry, he has achieved remarkable results in protecting the fisheries and fishing interests of the eastern Zhejiang seas and in apprehending pirates and bandits. It is reported that in order to step up defense and ensure the safety of fishermen, in addition to the existing patrol ships Fuhai and Qingan, which are currently patrolling the Shenjiamen area, and the Haijun warship, which is patrolling Shipu, the Ministry of Finance's old Biaohai patrol ship was entrusted to the Nanyang Shipyard in early September of this year to rush repairs. The internal machinery has been installed. It is scheduled to undergo sea trials tomorrow (the 28th). It is reported that once the sea trials are satisfactory, capable personnel will be appointed to go to the Shipu area within the year to assist the Haijun warship in suppressing pirates. The ship is 65 feet long and has a draft of 6 feet.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the League of Nations Health Committee</h3>
<p>Lachman Scheduled to Return to Geneva</p>
<p>Chairman Haas of the Communications Committee Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Havas News Agency reported on the 26th that Dr. Lachman, Chairman of the League of Nations Health Committee, will leave Shanghai on Tuesday, travelling to Geneva via Siberia. Dr. Lachman arrived in China in mid-September and undertook numerous tasks, including making recommendations to the Economic Committee regarding the use of the League of Nations' various technical health agencies and the assistance that the Chinese government can obtain in formulating and implementing construction plans, and coordinating epidemic prevention affairs in flood-stricken areas. The first level was a request from the National Government to the Council of the League of Nations, and the second level was a request from the Ministry of Health to the Council. Regarding epidemic prevention, the National Government Flood Relief Committee received letters from the governments of French Vietnam, Poland, Spain, the Dutch East Indies, India, Denmark, and others, offering assistance. Dr. Lachman, on behalf of the Council of the League of Nations, coordinated these efforts. To date, League of Nations Health Committee members Professor Sicca and Dr. Huang are still working in the disaster area for the Epidemic Prevention Committee. In addition, Professor Stampar, a well-known expert on health issues, will come to China in mid-January of next year to take on this work. The League of Nations Health Committee's recommendations to the Chinese government are based on the results of two on-site investigations. These investigations were very thorough. The part concerning medical education was undertaken by Professor Flexner from Denmark, and the part concerning the establishment of national import epidemic prevention offices was undertaken by Professor Long, Director of the League of Nations' Singapore Epidemic Prevention Office. In addition, Dr. Brook from the League of Nations Health Committee has been serving in the Nanjing Ministry of Health since July of last year. For the past two years, approximately forty members of the Chinese Ministry of Health have been invited by the League of Nations to study specialized subjects in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Regarding construction matters, it is divided into education and engineering. Regarding education, a survey team recently came to China, consisting of Lange, Vandepop, and others. At the request of the Ministry of Education, the League of Nations also sent one professor of geography, one professor of geology, and one professor of English literature. The situation is also very active in engineering. Haas, Chairman of the League of Nations Transportation Committee, arrived in Shanghai today (yesterday) and will replace Dr. Lachman in his work on the Economic Committee after Dr. Lachman leaves China. Three technicians will also come to China in half a month. In addition, two other technicians will use their expertise to assist the Economic Committee and other relevant agencies. Their stay in China will be quite long. In short, the cooperation between the Chinese Economic Committee and the League of Nations is both close and active, which can be stated with certainty.</p>

<h3>Two Important Telegrams from Various Road Business Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Federation of Business Associations sent two telegrams to the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee yesterday, expressing its views on national defense and financial issues. The texts of the telegrams are as follows:</p>
<h3>Please Hold Jinzhou Nanjing Central Party Headquarters Fourth Plenary Session First Central Committee</h3>
<p>Gentlemen, since the violent enemy troops suddenly approached our Liaoning and Jilin on the evening of September 18, the proper practice of legitimate self-defense under international law has not been applied. We begged for help from the League of Nations, but the League of Nations was indifferent. We invoked the covenant, but the covenant was ineffective. We allowed Ma Zhanshan to fight alone in Heilongjiang Province with limited troops and isolated forces, and the provincial capital was lost. We allowed the troops stationed in Jinzhou to hold a corner without giving them support. Where are Zhang Xueliang's 200,000 border defense troops? The border defense commander does not go to the front lines and roams freely in Beiping. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition and the unification of the country, whenever there is an opinion or a minor disagreement within the country, soldiers with troops send letters and telegrams one after another, saying "armed request for service" or "ready to fight at any moment". Once a trouble starts, millions of troops gather quickly. This kind of coordination can shake mountains and shock the world. However, since the National Crisis on September 18, it has been three months. Apart from Zhang Fakui, who has not shed the spirit of a soldier defending the country, the other soldiers who have flaunted their power in the past two or three years not only do not rush to the aid and recover the lost territory, but the telegrams of "armed request for service" and "ready to fight at any moment" have not been seen once. Now, at the time of your meeting and when Jinzhou is in danger, you should immediately order the government to mobilize quickly, save Jinzhou to secure the whole country, and attack to recover the lost territory, to comfort the spirit of the late Premier in heaven and to live up to the people's hopes. We urgently send this telegram and respectfully ask for your adoption. Shanghai General Federation of Business Associations</p>
<h3>Convene Economic Conference Nanjing Central Party Headquarters Fourth Plenary Session First Central Committee</h3>
<p>Gentlemen, since the news reported that a certain Central Committee member advocated for the allocation of principal and interest on bonds, a panic broke out in Shanghai. The National Federation of Commerce and Industry declared in advance, and various public organizations sent letters and telegrams afterwards. Our association had previously assisted the Ministry of Finance in raising a huge amount of bonds, which led to a flood of inquiries and accusations from subscribers, which were impossible to handle. Fortunately, the news reported on the 25th that the proposal had been withdrawn by the original proposer, but no clear statement from the Central Government has been seen guaranteeing that the principal and interest on the bonds will continue to be paid without interruption. We believe that even if the item</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Proposal is withdrawn today, there is still concern that it may be revived in the future. In the humble opinion of our association, paying the principal and interest on the bonds according to the contract is a symbol of mutual trust between the people and the government. Otherwise, if the government loses its credibility with the people, the people will have no way to understand the government's position. In this time of frequent wars, famine, repeated foreign debts, and the violent Japanese invasion, it is difficult to conceal that the country's finances are unsustainable, even with Zhang Zongchang and Su Bao, it is difficult to hide the state. To resolve this crisis, the only way is to convene a national economic conference, gather representatives from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, and jointly devise solutions, determine policies, and, following the German precedent, empower it with full power of supervision and design. All resolutions should be implemented, so that everyone can work together with one heart to save the people from fire and water and to place the country on a solid foundation. Internal stability and external resistance will be matters of course. We send this telegram with utmost urgency. Shanghai General Federation of Business Associations.</p>
<h3>North and South</h3>
<p>Merger and Organization of Two General Labor Unions</p>
<p>Meeting to be Held Today at 2 PM</p>
<p>Address: Pharmaceutical Association, Zhaojiabang Road</p>
<p>Since the realization of peaceful reunification, mass movements in various regions have flourished like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, with vigorous momentum. The workers in this city, numbering 800,000, previously had a General Labor Union, but it was later ordered to be disbanded because the Labor Union Law stipulated by the Legislative Yuan did not include such an organization. Recently, feeling the trend of the times, workers throughout the city have been discussing the establishment of a General Labor Union. However, due to the urgency of time and insufficient prior communication, the strange event of two General Labor Unions being established simultaneously in Zhabei on the 20th of this month occurred. It has been learned that people in the labor sector generally feel pained by the lack of unity in the worker organization and the future of the labor movement. Therefore, Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Xianting, Weng Ruifu, and others have been mediating to the best of their ability. It is reported that both sides have expressed understanding and agreed to convene a discussion meeting at 2 PM today (the 27th) at the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union on Zhaojiabang Road in the South City, bringing together responsible personnel from the two General Labor Unions to discuss cooperation issues. Regarding the existing dual organization and the previously elected executive and supervisory committee members, they may be automatically canceled and a general meeting of representatives from the city's labor sector will be reconvened for re-election.</p>

<h3>After Defiling Her, He Sold Her Body</h3>
<p>The Youth Yu Kecheng Was Too Unconscionable</p>
<p>Pawnshop Uncovers Abduction Case During Redemption</p>
<p>Huang Bode, a local resident who works as a printing foreman, lives at No. 779 Jin Yuan Lane, Carter Road. Two years ago, he married Sheng Meida through a matchmaker. Sheng was 29 years old and quite beautiful. Since their marriage, the couple had been very harmonious. However, on the morning of the 14th of last month, Sheng went out to shop and never returned. Huang suspected that his wife had suddenly disappeared and became suspicious. He checked the suitcases and discovered that she had taken away dozens of silver dollars, a gold pin, and two pawn tickets. The pawn tickets were for two items of newly made camel wool and gabardine qipaos that had been pawned at Changfeng Pawnshop on Shanhaiguan Road. He reported the matter to the police station, requesting them to investigate, and also informed Changfeng Pawnshop that if anyone came to redeem the items, they should be detained. On the 20th of this month, a Cantonese youth named Yu Kecheng (only 19 years old, residing at No. 1654 Haining Road) came to the pawnshop to redeem the items with the tickets. Huang was secretly notified, who reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Yu at the pawnshop. A gold pin belonging to Sheng was found on Yu's person. Under questioning, Yu admitted to raping and selling Sheng Meida without denying it, but also stated that his accomplice, Chen Yinshi, was hiding at No. 265 Kaierzier Road in the French Concession. Chinese and Western detectives then worked together with detectives from the French Concession to bring Chen Yinshi back, along with a suspect named Qian Arong, and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, presented the case, submitted the gold pin as evidence, and stated that Sheng Meida, the abducted woman, had been sold to Hankou, requesting a postponement to send detectives to Hankou for investigation. Huang Bode, the plaintiff, also submitted a report, explaining the above situation. Yu Kecheng, the defendant, confessed that he had known Sheng for a short time and that he was unemployed. One day, he met Chen Yinshi in Yanziwo. After talking, on the seventh day of the tenth lunar month, he, Chen Yinshi, and Sheng Meida went to Hankou together on the Xiangyang ship and stayed at the home of his friend Yu Binqi at No. 73 Shencheng Lane, Jiaotong Road. Later, because his business was unsuccessful, Chen Yinshi found a way to sell Sheng. The total price was 320 yuan, of which he received 90 yuan, and the rest was taken by Chen. On the 12th of this month, he returned to Shanghai with Chen. The day before yesterday, he attempted to redeem the pawned items at Changfeng Pawnshop and was arrested. He confirmed that the gold pin was given to him by Sheng. Chen Yinshi stated that she had previously been punished by the French Concession for an abduction case. This time, because Yu was unemployed, she went to Hankou with Yu and Sheng and stayed at the Jiaotong Hotel for about a month. Yu's business was still unsuccessful, and the daily expenses were already substantial, and they owed a lot of travel expenses. Sheng voluntarily offered to help, so Chen Qinhuang introduced them, and she sold Sheng to No. 16 Lunhe Lane, Xingsheng Road (Chinese territory), Hankou to work as a prostitute under the alias Wang Eryuan. At that time, a promissory note was written for 320 yuan. After deducting the flag fees, the remaining amount was taken by Yu. Qian Arong had nothing to do with it. She came to Shanghai to prepare the money to redeem the clothes Sheng had pawned in order to redeem her. Qian Arong claimed that he had nothing to do with this matter. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions and ordered Qian to provide a guarantor who could be summoned at any time, and to await investigation, as Sheng Meida had not yet been found. Yu Kecheng and Chen Yinshi were sent back to prison. The police were ordered to send detectives to Hankou to find Sheng Meida for further verification.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Woman Sues Husband's Brother</h3>
<p>For Holding onto Shared Property</p>
<p>Ye Hong, a woman from Zhenhai, Ningbo, found that after her husband, Ye Wende, passed away in the eleventh year of the Republic, he was still living in his former residence. Recently, she found that when her father-in-law, Ye Yufan, died, he left behind property worth about 200,000 yuan, which her husband's brother, Ye Yuande, was holding onto. He was in charge of Wende's share of the property but concealed it and refused to give it to her. Therefore, she came to Shanghai and hired lawyer Li Xinyang to sue Yuande in the Civil Court of the Special Court, demanding to divide the inheritance of her late father-in-law. Furthermore, she found that Ye Yufan had jointly purchased houses in Hongxingfang, Baoshan Road, Zhabei with Jiang Quanmao and Du Qiwen. On the day of the court hearing, Ye Yuande denied having this property. Ye Hong accused Ye Yuande of denying the existence of proven property, which constituted an act of encroachment on shared property, and filed a criminal complaint of embezzlement with the Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Bingrong opened the Fifth Criminal Court to summon the defendant, Ye Yuande, who did not appear due to illness. His lawyer was appointed to represent him in court. First, Ye Hong claimed that after her best efforts, she found that Yufan also had 144 shares of the China Electric Company's stock, valued at 1,440 yuan, which the defendant had pawned at Renheng Money Shop on October 14 of this year. There were also 1,500 yuan of Qinhuangdao Liujiang Coal Mine stock, three shares of Ningshao Shipping Company stock, and stock in the Coal Industry Five Lines. This property was all purchased by her late father-in-law and was recently discovered by her, so it was not listed in the complaint. The defendant's lawyer then requested an adjournment, stating that the defendant was indeed ill and unable to appear in court, and requested a postponement, submitting the prescription as evidence. Subsequently, lawyer Li Xinyang briefly supplemented the plaintiff's statements. Judge Shen then adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<p>Ling Xichao, the district chief of the Second District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordered an investigation into a robbery that occurred at the Hongyu Weaving Factory at No. 439 Zhaozhou Road on November 21 of this year. It is now learned that the case was solved by Chen Wentong, a detective in the district, on the 24th of this month, based on a tip. He secretly reported it to squad leader Cao Junda, who reported it to District Chief Ling.

They arrested Qu Jinyang, one of the robbers in the case, and interrogated him at the district headquarters. He also confessed that his accomplices were at the Yahui Building on Shangwen Road. Squad leader Cao then dispatched detectives to the location provided by the suspect. They arrested the robbers Shi Youming and Mao Fuqing (Shi Youming's teacher), who were suspected of being involved, and brought them all to the district headquarters. They were then subjected to interrogation by District Chief Ling. Shi Youming confessed to robbing property from the Hongyu Weaving Factory. He also confessed to robbing the Yixin Silk Weaving Factory at No. 17 Weiwu Road, Jumen Branch Road, on April 1, taking away banknotes, woolen cloth, men's and women's clothing, etc., worth about 500 to 600 yuan. However, he confessed that a pistol had been taken away by Shi's mistress and its whereabouts were unknown, so it could not be traced. After District Chief Ling ascertained the facts, the case involved robbery, so he should prepare a document and submit it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning, along with the names, ages, and addresses of the robbers. Shi Youming, 27 years old, from Haimen, currently residing at No. 6 Dong'an Lane, Fangxie Road. Qu Jinyang, 27 years old, from Nantong, currently residing at No. 14 Hongqiao Road. Mao Fuqing, 42 years old, from Haimen, currently residing at No. 99 Daji Road.</p>
<h3>Petty Thief Steals Small Silver Box</h3>
<p>At noon yesterday, at the Yebiji Tea Shop near Wangjia Wharf in the South City, the shop's staff were having lunch when a naughty boy suddenly came in. Taking advantage of the shop's unpreparedness, he sneaked under the counter and grabbed a small silver box from the counter. He then climbed out of the counter and ran away. Fortunately, a shop assistant named Tang Shoujin from Sijing saw him and quickly gave chase. The boy saw someone chasing him and knew things were not going well, so he threw the stolen small silver box on the side of the road. Tang picked up the silver box and continued to chase, shouting loudly to catch the thief. When he reached the entrance of Wangjia Wharf Limei Road, Nan Shengwen, the police officer on duty at the second post there, heard the commotion and intercepted the boy. He took him to the First Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation by the precinct chief, Tang Qijin, 41 years old, stated the details of the incident and requested punishment. The boy confessed that his name was Zhou Tingrong, 14 years old, from Wenzhou, residing on Sangwei Street outside Xiaonanmen. He confessed to stealing the small silver box from the Yebiji Tea Shop. It was found that the boy was young and small, and often sneaked into shops to steal when people were not prepared. He had been arrested for such incidents dozens of times. This time, he dared to steal the small silver box from the tea shop and was caught on the spot. It was clear that he was incorrigible. He was ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Opium Harms People One After Another</h3>
<p>Due to Xu's Wrongful Accusation</p>
<p>A woman from Jiangyin named Xie Dajie lived with Jiang Yinsheng from Huangyan in her hometown. Xie's father had a severe opium addiction. Due to illness, he asked Xie Dajie to come to Shanghai to buy 27 taels of opium, which she hid in a rattan basket. Two months ago, she went to the North Railway Station to take a train back to her hometown. At the station, she met Jiang Yinsheng's wife, Xu, who was also returning home. Xie entrusted her luggage to Xu for safekeeping while she went to buy a train ticket. Unexpectedly, the police officer checking the luggage found the opium. Xu claimed that it belonged to Xie Dajie, but Xie had already fled, resulting in Xu being transferred to the local court and sentenced to six months in prison. She is currently still in jail. Later, Jiang Yinsheng negotiated with Xie's father, who died suddenly. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30, Jiang Yinsheng was walking across Fangbang Bridge outside Xiaobeimen when he met Xie Dajie. He immediately called the police officer Li Huixuan, who arrested her. According to the interrogation by Chief Xu, Xie Dajie admitted to the plaintiff's accusation of entrusting her to carry the opium. As the case had already been filed with the court, she was sentenced and sent to the local court for handling.</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<h3>News of Mr. Liu Jisheng</h3>
<p>(Advocating the use of Japanese goods to reward soldiers fighting against Japan)</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Zhang Liyang and Mr. Li Shi's inquiries as published in your esteemed newspaper about how to handle the sealed Japanese goods, I, due to being on military campaign, was unable to read them, which I deeply regret. However, I greatly agree with Mr. Xing Li's proposal to use Japanese goods as military expenses against Japan, which is like fighting poison with poison. The Japanese education system always shows children how to seize Chinese land to obtain China's precious, beautiful, playable, and edible items, in order to induce their ambition to scheme against us. It cannot be said that this is not far-sighted. We should now take the most beautiful Japanese goods as rewards to encourage the soldiers fighting against Japan. Woolen and other fabrics should be used for military uniforms, and other valuable items should also be used for comfort purposes. It is absolutely forbidden to auction them off to obtain money for military expenses. Because if we auction them off, the mistake might cause our people to covet cheap prices and still buy Japanese goods (our slogan is not to buy Japanese goods!). If we wait until goods can be imported before paying money, then those who destroy their homes to help the country are not worthy of praise. We should bankrupt ourselves to save the country, and only then can we show this to our people.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I respectfully write to inform you that your newspaper's publication on the 23rd of this month regarding the so-called joint meeting of various branches, listed the name of our branch, which is extremely surprising. After investigation, all actions of our branch have always emphasized organization, and we do not participate in illegal activities. However, since the aforementioned joint meeting is neither a legal organization nor sought our consent beforehand, we are truly concerned about causing confusion and rumors. Therefore, we hereby send this letter to correct the record. Respectfully wishing you good health.</p>
<p>Li Weixiong, Standing Committee Member, First District Twenty-Seventh Branch, December 26th.</p>

<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Huo Jin</p>
<p>Whenever anyone hears the word "hometown," they are bound to reminisce with lingering and quiet thoughts, fondly recalling the sweet and comfortable life of the past, especially thinking of the caring and warmth of their loving mother, the small, yet endless kindness. This makes those who are wanderers feel that this kind of love is infinitely great and unforgettable for a lifetime. Changing the way of thinking, feeling that the broad love of a loving mother cannot be enjoyed for a lifetime, one becomes gloomy and sad. Therefore, those who study thousands of miles away or seek a living far from home, if their white-haired, aging mother still exists, who wouldn't want to seize a spare moment to go home and enjoy the warm affection that flows from nature?</p>
<p>Recently, our Miss Jin, because she wanted to rush into the arms of her loving mother and receive her mother's comfort, took the opportunity of the school's few days of closure and gracefully returned home. Miss Yin also went to her hometown in Zhenjiang, where the provincial government is located. She goes there often. Several times a month, her beautiful figure can be found on the Nanjing-Shanghai train. As for myself, it's quite pitiful to say. I haven't seen my hometown, which is as beautiful as a painting, for three full years. At this time, seeing people going back one after another, how can I not be moved? Therefore, I also want to point my toes towards my hometown and step back.</p>
<p>However, my return this time is not to fall into the arms of my loving mother, to laugh heartily for a while, or to cry bitterly, to enjoy the influence of her love. No. Is it to appreciate the excellent scenery of my hometown, to wash away the accumulated filth in my mind, which has been buried in the hustle and bustle of Shanghai all day long? No, it's not for any of these reasons. The biggest motivation for my return is to go back to comfort my precious sister, Yu Mei, whom I have been separated from for three years and who is now groaning in bed with illness.</p>
<p>Alright, my hometown, the county named Longxi, has surprisingly appeared before my eyes. In my mind, the situations that I had lingered here three years ago, scene by scene, recurring thoughts, layers of past events, are all folding in my heart. Oh, at this time, is my mood sweet, bitter, sad, or happy? Awkward as I am, I still can't describe it with my pen.</p>
<p>From her expression, Yu Mei is still the Yu Mei from three years ago. Although she is already married, she still has a naive and innocent look. Although she is ill, her face still shows a pretty and lovely expression, without a hint of haggard and dejected morbidity. Her family members all say that she has lost weight, but according to my observation, she doesn't seem to be any thinner than she was when she was a child. This is probably because her body was a little fatter in the early days after her marriage.</p>
<p>Yu Mei's illness started after childbirth. Less than a month after giving birth, she suddenly fell ill. The illness was no small matter, but rather very serious. The old women in her family are all idol worshippers. They made a fuss over everything from drawing lots to asking for divination, to inviting witches to pray to the gods. On the other hand, they also sought medical treatment. By the time I went to her house, her illness had already subsided. However, a breast abscess had grown on her right breast. This was due to binding her chest in her childhood. Pus and blood were congealed on her breast, like a rotten peach. When she changed the plaster, she frowned, all anxious. How could she not frown when she peeled off the hard plaster from her already rotten skin, making her feel unbearable pain? Moreover, she had to insert seven or eight medicine threads into the rotten flesh, making people even more frightened to see it. At that time, I proposed that after changing the medicinal powder, she should no longer apply the plaster. It would be best to apply things like medicated cotton gauze and rubber plasters. This would reduce her pain. Who knew that in this rural area with inconvenient transportation, it was impossible to buy these things with money? Even in the only small hospital here, the number of these things was limited. Even if you paid a high price, you couldn't buy more. If I had known that she was in this kind of embarrassing situation, I would have bought some and brought them to her in Shanghai long ago. On this breast abscess, the areola that has not yet rotted seems to have become hardened. If you lightly touch it with your finger, she would simply scream in pain. Moreover, every day at dusk, the nipple would throb, making her even more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yu Mei's husband, Mr. Xue An, is a sincere young man. Although I only met him for the first time, I have been corresponding with him for more than a year. From his letters, I know that he is a very studious, warm-hearted, and promising young man. Although he was born into an old-fashioned gentry family, he doesn't have any of the characteristics of a playboy. His family runs a storefront and a large shop. Because he is the eldest son and there is a lack of able-bodied people in the family, he is required to take care of things in the shop, one thing at a time, three times seven equals twenty-one. Therefore, he did not have the opportunity to go out for further studies, but was instead married off early. However, in his spare time, he always diligently reads books and newspapers and whips himself on. Therefore, his knowledge and insights can be truly said to be outstanding among the young people in my hometown.</p>
<p>Since he is a descendant of the gentry, his family is undoubtedly a large family. In this large family, if something happens, it is easy to get help. Especially if someone gets sick, the experienced wives, related uncles, nephews, aunts, and cousins all have enthusiasm and carefully serve the sick, feeding them tea and soup, and talking to relieve their worries. This is very difficult to achieve in a simple small family, where everything must be done by servants. Every evening, after dinner, everyone is idle and gathers in the room where Yu Mei is resting, with grandmothers, aunts, grandmothers, girls, and young uncles, all gathered together, crying and laughing, how lively. Yu Mei, who is lying in bed and constantly groaning, will also talk and laugh when she is happy, and therefore forget the pain. However, sometimes when she gets tired, she impatiently closes her eyes and pretends to be asleep. Because she has taken a lot of medicine when she was sick and her body is weak, her ears are not very clear. But if there is a noisy sound around her, how can she not hear it and feel annoyed?</p>
<p>Although Yu Mei has become a mother, she is still a bit childish. Whenever she loudly complains about the pain in her breasts, I will tell her some stories. What she likes to hear the most are those fairy tales with supernatural and mysterious elements. When she concentrates and listens intently, she will even gesticulate with her hands and feet, completely forgetting all the pain in her body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yu Mei's crystallization of love is a girl who is less than two months old, with white skin, beautiful and lovely, her eyes shining brightly as she looks at people, without any fear of strangers. She eats the wet nurse's milk, but Yu Mei holds her in her arms and caresses her several times a day at least. Although Yu Mei's illness was caused by this child, she never hates her. Instead, she reveals the love of nature and applies it to this little treasure. Ah, the love between mother and child, how great it is.</p>
<p>Since Yu Mei became ill, she has not eaten any solid food at all. Every day she only sips a mouthful of porridge. When I went, it was just when her illness was gradually recovering. People who have recovered from a long illness are naturally very hungry. She felt that congee was not filling enough, so she clamored for rice. But her in-laws, because her stomach was weak after her illness, were afraid that she would not be able to digest it, so they still gave her porridge to eat. She then threw a childish tantrum, seemingly</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>angrily saying, "A beggar, when begging for food from people, will surely get some rice after going to several houses. But I have begged you for rice for many days, and you still refuse to give me rice. Am I not even like a beggar?" This made everyone laugh. Later, with the doctor's permission, she was gradually given some rice to eat.</p>
<p>I stayed in Longxi for a week, and Yu Mei's illness slowly recovered. However, the thick blood flowing from her breast has not stopped. According to the doctor, "It is feared that it will not be possible to achieve the effect of closing the sore in a short period of time, but there will be no more troubles." She has suffered enough for the pain of this rotten sore in her breast. Alas, how pitiful.</p>
<p>This time, I discovered two pleasant things in my hometown that I hadn't seen for three years. First, the current district chief is our female compatriot, Shen Qingquan from Hangzhou. I once visited her. She is about thirty years old, speaks extraordinarily, and is a very capable person. Since she took office in March of this year, she has benefited the local area a lot, and the people have praised her endlessly. Everyone says, "She is much better than the corrupt district chief from before." Second, the education of local girls in middle school has now been established. In the past, it was a rural area with only a few primary schools and private schools for boys and girls. Now, there is a Ms. Xie Guanghua, a native of this village, who graduated from Shanghai's Shanghai University and has served in the education field for many years with excellent academic experience. Because she realized that education in her hometown was underdeveloped, she resolutely returned to Longxi to found a Zhicheng Primary School. The system includes primary and junior high school, but because the local customs are stubborn, boys and girls cannot study together, so it only accepts girls. Therefore, the general girls who have graduated from primary school can have the opportunity to receive secondary education. However, the customs of this township are still full of stubborn qualities, and the general girls who have graduated from primary school often have no intention of moving forward and are busy making wedding dresses instead of continuing their studies. Therefore, there are only a little over twenty students in the junior high school here, which cannot but be said to be a regret.</p>
<p>Two days before my return to Shanghai, one unforgettable thing was to go to the final resting place of my deceased parents to sweep the tomb. It is a piece of land with a small stream in front, mulberry and bamboo planted in the back, and scattered weeds in the middle, protruding and growing. In this piece of land with less than three years of history, sleep the sacred bodies of my strict and loving parents who abandoned me, a lonely and weak daughter. Their voices and smiles still linger in my memory. But at this time, even if I shed all my sad tears and shouted until my anxious throat was hoarse, how can I resurrect the dead and make the bones white and make the strict and loving ones who have returned to heaven come back to life so that I can listen to their loving voices again, kiss their kind and blessed faces again, throw myself into their arms again, and receive their comfort? My parents have passed away for several years, and I am still floating and sinking in this vast sea of humanity, lonely, helpless, desolate, and without appeal. Dear parents, if you know that your weak daughter is living such a lonely life, how sad would you be?</p>

<h3>A Handkerchief</h3>
<p>— Shan Jun</p>
<p>Old Wang, let's go watch the girls play basketball, how about it? No, who has so much free time to watch them play basketball? It's quite embarrassing, Hu said seemingly disdainfully. Don't say that, the red and green, the swaying, it's really quite interesting. Besides, hey, Little Sister is also playing.</p>
<p>Really? Hu seemed to be moved.</p>
<p>Who would lie to you?</p>
<p>Let's go, already expressed the greatest and final determination.</p>
<p>And so a large group of people, in a mighty manner, headed straight for the basketball court.</p>
<p>At this time, on the basketball court, only a mess of red pants and green clothes could be seen, with the sound of warblers and swallows scattering in all directions. Especially in the minds of every male classmate that was scattered in all directions, was naturally that immature person who we usually called Little Sister Cenzi. Now, the three words "Little Sister" seem to have succeeded in becoming her specialized term in our school. This, in the minds of our two honest men, Wang and Hu, could of course not be an exception. Little Sister, Little Sister, oh!</p>
<p>Hey, Old Wang, look, Little Sister dropped a handkerchief. Go quickly and pick it up. Isn't this the beginning of a contact? A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, oh. Don't let someone else snatch it away. Old Wang!</p>
<p>No point. I don't want to have this kind of opportunity. I think, don't pretend to be upright in front of me like this again. Honestly, you should hurry up and pick it up and return it to her. You know that in this kind of situation, there's no use in being polite. Otherwise, it will be someone else's opportunity. Wang's words seemed to have some thorns in them.</p>
<p>What does it matter? In this socially open society, you say, I picked up a handkerchief for her, would anyone still say that I have other ambitions? That's really too vulgar.</p>
<p>Of course, who can say that? That's really too out of touch with the times, a bastard who deserves a slap in the face. Hey, go pick it up quickly. Look, this handkerchief has been trampled by their ruthless shoes into something unrecognizable. This should be such a pity.</p>
<p>Oh, is that so? Alas, that's really a pity. I must pick it up and return it to her. Otherwise, that's really too bad. God, give me some courage! Hu said, and it seemed that God had really given him a lot of courage. He moved his steps very spiritedly, but after taking only a few steps, he hurriedly came back with a face that had turned as red as a pig's liver.</p>
<p>Hey, Old Hu, what's wrong? Why did you take a few steps and shrink back?</p>
<p>I'm very afraid that the classmates will see it and shout. That wouldn't be good. I think it would be better to pick it up after everyone has left. What do you think?</p>
<p>Hehe…</p>
<p>What are you sneering at? Are you daring to ridicule me for not having the ability? Go, don't even talk about it. I'll definitely pick it up for you to see! Hu seemed to be enraged by Old Wang's great insult. And so he had to show Old Wang that he really had the determination and courage.</p>
<p>Who said you don't have the ability? But you said you were going to pick it up a long time ago, going to pick it up, but, until now, almost half an hour has passed, and I only hear you say "I must pick it up," "I must pick it up." That's enough for someone to have "ability"!</p>
<p>Okay, you wait and see!</p>
<p>Before long, the sky was gradually darkening. The red and green figures also slipped into the room one by one. The idlers naturally also dragged a satisfied laughter away. This was the time when our upright honest man, Hu, bravely began his work. But how long did it take, a second later…</p>
<p>Ah, run quickly, Old Wang! The handkerchief…although I picked it up, but…but my heart is…is…is in a panic and trembling!</p>
<p>And so, in the pale twilight, two black shadows sped away like lightning, quite like a thief encountering a watchman.</p>
