<p>慘重水災。浸沉大陸。東南西北。哭聲一片。一萬萬災黎浮沉水中。正切盼政府與國人出其援手。解倒懸於垂危。在此國如纍卵民不堪命之際乃突聞粤桂風雲。驟形緊張。將欲以黨政之爭執。最後訴諸兵戎。水刦未已。兵刦將臨。垂死之民。聽此惡耗倍感未刦之將至。惶急不可終朝。就國危民敝。不堪再戰而言。吾人敢以最後僅存之血涙。呼籲和平。</p>
<p>革命以來。政變迭作。江南河北。戰跡宛在。吾人常在革命過程中。必得忍受短時期苦痛憧憬前途。忍受現實即當局亦常以此昭告全國。勸勉人民忍受過程中之苦痛然而時至今日。天災人禍。相繼而來。此次洪水。更爲百年來未有之慘刦。强半國土。浸没流億萬生靈。全淪魚鱉。黄河以北大江以南。但見巨浪拍天。但聞哭聲動野。人畜漂流。田廬蕩盡。國家元氣。損失無餘。刦餘殘生。僅存一息。民衆於此。實已生無食所。死無葬地矣。於此危急存亡之際。何忍不急求所以瞻災黎之死。而更於痛肉之上。加以刀割。墮井之後。投以巨石。使未絕於洪水之一綫國脈。一息民命。斷送於戰亂刀兵。而萬刦不復哉。</p>
<p>今日之倡言救國黨者。要都由於愛國愛黨之熱念所驅使。雖意見稍有異同而目的則一。目的旣都不外於救國與救民。則在今國勢危殆。民陷水火。黨内之爭持。皆可於黨内解决。何必掀動干戈。舉國與民以殉黨。最近英相麥克唐於國勢危急之際不惜犧牲黨見。瘁力謀國。誠以黨附於國。國之不存。黨將焉附。吾人目前亟應認清此義。次之。國家政治亟有待於刷新。但際此急難。何莫不可以開誠佈公。共謀改革。抑且民溺洪流。忍死待救。權其輕重。量其緩急。急救災民。爲國内與國際所共認爲緊急之要圖。若輕其所重。重其所輕。置億萬災黎於不顧則砲火之下。寗有孑遺。寗有完土。又况東鄰鷹瞵虎視。伺隙以逞。萬案韓案。今猶未决。而積極侵略之聲。又不絕於耳。内戰一起。外患乘之其禍將有不忍言者。</p>
<p>抑有進者。方今萬衆溺水。急待拯救。國帑枯竭。籌欵維艱若軍事一興。則軍用物品。必皆搜羅現欵。購諸外國奪災黎之及食。購殺人之槍彈。以搏戰於疆塲。以茶毒我同胞砲彈所至。血肉飛濺。誰無父母。誰無妻孥。言念及此。能無沉痛。水旱刀兵。連年不絕。民苦矣。今復何求。但願戢息人禍。俾能安居。使老弱不至轉輾溝壑。少壯不至流亡道途。此最低限度之希望。顧亦忍心靳而勿予耶。雖然。連年變亂。皆非偶然。要皆有其癓結。如何刷新政治。斯乃爲斷絕禍亂之根本要圖。茲後我國人應切實團結掬誠共謀。盪垢滌污。刷心悔禍。但求利國裨民。不計其他。一致努力於救災剿匪抗强。俾政治得臻於清明。國基得臻於穩固。人民得有甦息之機。否則漫漫長夜。國家前途眞永無破曉時也。今日爲孫中先生首次革命紀念日。孫先生當年爲救國家救民族而奮鬭之精神。今猶宛在。於今日萬方多難之秋。廻念先烈創業之艱難。吾人在今日倍覺涙泗滂沱。怛忉而未能自已。服膺於孫先生者。其亦念諸。</p>

<p>▲視察情形至於法方團員、現尙逗留迪化、想俟西來一隊會合、然後出新回平、此次考察團在未出發前、已多波折、民誼承中國學術協會推爲團長、未敢固辭、願任其難、同時又受中央之命、視察新疆黨務、故亦必逹到目的地、始可覆命、至學術考察團、雖未能中法合作到底、然於去時、我國團員在途中作各種考察者、亦不乏人、在新疆亦能盡量視察、（容再分别詳細報告）在華方亦不得謂非一種成功、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c88">編製大學課程的意見 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>陳中凡</p>
<p>大學課程之編製、應有一定的目標、一貫的計劃、方不致破碎支離、漫無體系、試觀近來各大學自行選課制以後、除規定國文英文數學爲第一年必修課外、餘均聽學生分系選修、於是各就興致所近、惟求專精、不問程叙、蓋好高務遠、青年習氣使然、原無足異、而其流弊所及、在學生則常識不充、根底不厚、即進而研究專門題目、專家學說、淺嘗薄涉、心得毫無、在學校則以開設課程太多、非三五專任敎員所能分任、必多聘兼任講師、濫支經費、在敎員則以所敎課程範圍太狹、敎材枯窘、不得不東塗西抺、敷衍塞責、矯此諸弊、擬將大學課程、加以整理、具如左方、</p>
<p>（一）課程</p>
<p>大學課程、擬分四類、一·公共必修科、二·公共選修課、三·主系必修科、四·輔系選修科、前二年讀畢一二兩類、後兩年進修三四兩類、</p>

<p>二、西洋文化史三學分</p>
<p>三、現代文明概觀三學分</p>
<p>四、國際政治經濟現狀三學分</p>

<p>以上五組、共選讀五十四學分、於第一二年習完、</p>
<p>三、主系必修課約三十至五十學分</p>
<p>四、輔系選修課約二十學分</p>
<p>（二）學分分配</p>
<p>第一二學期、約讀二十至二十二學分、共四○丨四四</p>
<p>第三四學期、同前、四○丨四四</p>

<p>（四）經費</p>
<p>如上所述、第一二年僅由文理兩學院開設公共必修選修各課、供學生選習、其他各學院無須别開課程、即可將第一二年經費、全部移出、供設備及研究之用、較之現制、開支必省、</p>
<p>（五）設備</p>
<p>現在各大學除自然科輔以實騐外、其他社會科學注重實地調查測騐者、殊不多觀、若文藝哲學諸科、則除課室演講而外、更無討論演習機會、此後應增設各科研究室、陳列各項參考材料、使學生自行檢閱、並規定師生討論時間、以相質證</p>
<p>（六）導師</p>
<p>現時各大學敎員有一人兼任二三校課程者、終日奔走道塗學生接觸機會甚少、遑論切磋、此後應設法提高待遇限制兼課、並由專任敎員擔任導師、除授課外、每週規定時間、在研究室指導學生、切實研究、</p>
<p>以上就個人意見所及、約略陳述、冀海内聞逹加以指正、</p>

<p>勝負兵家常事、何足計較、但須求求其勝負之焦點所在、可以改進策略、俾成全才、身手矯健、球藝純熟、持志健兒當之無愧、惟其遠擲欠準、犯規過多、籃卜之隨進太少、不幸失敗於西青者、職是故耳、西青陣勢不及持志整齊、而穩重過之、其勝也、即在少犯規多罰中、西青罰中八分犯規四次、持志罰中二分犯規十一次、西青多得六分、就擲中球數論、持志十一球、（二十二分）西青十球、（二十分）是持志多中一球、雙方比較、持志實有可勝之能也、</p>

<p>讀者通信</p>
<p>葉景新君訊</p>
<p>這是一個最重要的問題丨就是大學生的出路、我引爲疑惑的、就是中國的大學、光是敎人在學校裏活動、一到畢業、就眞正的（畢）（業、）非但（畢）了大學的學程、連在社會上的事業、也一箍腦兒（畢）掉、自然、東也喊着（没有事情幹）西也嚷着、（找不到職業、）天下有没有已經幹完的事呢、有没有還剩在那裏的事業期待着你去幹呢、戴了社會學者的眼鏡的人類能道個中癓結、也頗有些不平凡的理由、而且表示着同情、替一班失業的學生憐惜、或者呐喊幾聲、可是那剛才接洽定當、而忽然變卦、仍舊賦閑的朋友、連篇疊牘的要怎樣要怎樣的文章、還是依舊在紙上、我虔誠地向記者先生討一個辦法、丨一個切實的給予大學生一條出路的辦法、請先生在報上答覆、這個關於大衆的問題、</p>
<p>（覆）這問題怕不是在大學旣畢業後的問題、一大半怕還是大學敎育方面的問題、是大學生就學以前和修學時問的問題、而一部分怕還是社會不景氣的問題、</p>
<p>社會不景氣問題、關係方面太多、暫且不談、</p>
<p>照吾們所知道、此時學工程的人才、各方面不够用、學醫的亦然、乃至報端登載徵求某種某種專家、無人應徵的、不知多少、可見不是社會不需要人才、是現在所造就的人才、供求不相應、這是大學設科上和大學生就學上所該早早注意到的、</p>
<p>再講到大學施敎的方針和方法、大學生修學的態度、是否和業業後出路問題、有連帶的影響、怕也有注意的必要、</p>
<p>今姑一切不談、專談大學生旣畢業後出路困難的解决方法、</p>
<p>所謂出路困難、大概屬於求人方面、求人無效、吾們來想法求已、譬如連合若干同志、從事編書譯書、吾也知道賣稿子是一件狠不容易、而且狠使人生氣的事、不過吾想如果所挑選的問題、的確是社會所需要、若是譯的、称把原書、或先試譯數節、給購稿機關審查、要是眞能動人、他們一定樂於接受、此法自己且可增進學識、丨這不過是舉個例、或者還有類此的方法、</p>
<p>可是大學生不一定都有這種能力、姑且說兩種近乎消極的方法、先希望大學生把自己身分資格種種觀念、一切抛棄、再把他困難的現象分析一下、然後替他解答、</p>
<p>（一）所以没有出路、一半怕爲是學科不對、眞是無可如何、只有短期修習社會比較需要的學科、</p>
<p>（二）所以没有出路、一半也許是和大學畢業相當的位置没有、眞是無可如何、只有退一步想、再没有、再退一步想、</p>
<p>吾想這兩層、大學生普通的心理是不狠愿意接受的、不過吾先已說明、這是無可如何時的辦法、最好還得照前面所說、在施敎以前、修學以前從根本上解决、</p>
<p>以上是替大學生自己打算、吾終狠熱烈地希望政府、希望社會領袖、早早想出一種計劃、使得消納多量的大學畢業生、勿使他們長期的徘徊歧路、</p>

<p>興中會成立後。孫中山陳少白楊衢雲陸皓東諸人。努力排滿運動。謀襲取廣州爲根据地。籌備半載。於九月九日發難。時爲民國紀元前十七年乙未。爲孫總理革命第一次之起義。不幸失敗。丘四朱貴全陸皓東程耀臣等因而殉難。是時粤督爲譚鍾麟（祖安之父）。以事關重大。特令南海番禺兩縣嚴刑審訊。欲藉此而大興黨獄。南海縣令李徵庸提陸皓東審訊。聲色俱厲。喝陸下跪。陸不爲屈。慷慨激昻。索紙筆認供。振筆直書。一揮而就。其辭曰。吾姓陸。名中桂。號皓東。香山翠微鄕人。年二十九歲。向居外處。今始返粤。與同鄕孫文憤異族政府之腐敗專制。官吏之貪污庸懦。外人之陰謀窺伺。憑弔中原。荆棘滿目。每一念及眞不知涕涙之何從也。（中略）無奈貪官污吏。劣紳腐懦。靦顔鮮恥。甘心事仇。不曰本朝深仁厚澤。即曰我輩踐士食毛。詎知滿清以建州賊種。入主中國。奪我土地。殺我祖宗。擄我子女玉帛。試思誰食誰之毛。誰踐誰之士。揚州十日。嘉定三屠。與夫兩王入粤殘殺我漢人之歷史。猶多聞而知之。而謂此爲恩澤乎、要之今日非廢滅滿清。决不足以光復漢族。非誅除漢奸。又不足以滅滿清。故吾等尤欲誅一二狗官。以爲我漢人當頭一棒。今事雖不成。此心甚慰。吾言盡矣。請速行刑等語。</p>
<p>李徵　閱後。以陸所供措詞激烈。異常慚恐。惟陸不肯供出同黨。遂用諸種非法苛刑。如釘挿手足鑿齒鞭扑炙背等。無不盡施。慘酷備至。暈厥數次。堅不吐供。而視死如歸且謂李曰。汝輩狗官。雖以極刑加諸我。伹我肉體雖痛。而心甚安。汝其奈我何。翌日。駐廣州美領事親訪李氏。謂陸乃電報繙譯生。絕非造反。伊可保證。李示以陸之供詞。美領無言而退。及李奉譚令處朱丘陸程刑時。李以陸年少翩翩。且嫺文墨。行刑之日。飭人衣以長衣。</p>
<p>是役也。孫總理先走澳門轉香港。施偕陳少白鄭士良東渡日本。楊衢雲則往印度及非洲各地。餘亦匿居港澳。秘密運動。以圖復舉。今日爲廣州乙未第一次起義紀念日。故追紀之。</p>

<p>今平漢平綏北寗三路交軌之處曰豐臺。入北平第一巨站也。金之南城門曰豐宜。蓋城廢而門址猶存。故得今名。每車行過此。若當花時。必有持盈握之芍藥以求售者。紅紫繽紛。使人忘征塵之倦。往時豐臺居民皆以蒔花爲業。連甽接塍。不植他物。内苑候門簪鬢之需。繁費若此。唐詩所謂近來無奈牡丹何。數十千錢買一窠窼。遺風餘韻。猶有存者也。毛西河之姬人曰田田。即此處賣花翁之女。吸風飲露。想見姑射之肌。咸同間猶有騷雅之士就此置酒。王壬父湘綺樓詩注云。每歲花時須以十金留一日。俾勿剪去。可供賞燕。當時已以爲奢。今社稷壇園圃甚盛。短籬圍之。巡行一週。香盈裾袂。游人鮮復遠至豐臺者。北平園藝之工爲諸都市冠。名葩異種。難悉舉名。尤適士性者。芍藥以外。則數海棠。凡人家庭院稍闊者輙有輙有雙株。而設宫絳雪軒南海頣年堂頣和園樂壽堂植此尤茂。余長沙城中故宅有雙株。勢殊峻拔。已近百年。蓋物主爲滿洲裕某自北都移植者。薪木曁毁。神物遂枯。及移家北平。宅中前後兩院亦各有兩叢。一絳一白。每年遞爲衰盛。白者　枝偃蹇。垂陰滿庭。雖在北平亦爲罕見。復次則紫白丁香。叢生不擇地。與海棠開時相先後。苞藥細瑣。馨香酷烈。然挿之膽瓶。雅而兼豔。以視歐西之紫羅蘭何渠不若邪。等而更下。則石榴與夾竹桃。此二物自晚春以歷中秋花實不絕。布列中庭。足增富麗。亦舊都風俗也。好事者戲以二語括滿人第宅之狀。曰天棚魚缸石榴樹。先肥狗大了頭。意謂其中庭必架天棚。門首必列盎以貯金魚。而以榴點綴其問。先生云云。則其家所豢養也。逹官富賈。絕無雅骨。其家居布置濃俗。躍然如見。雖曰謔而近虐。亦非善於體會物情者不能道也。每歲除將近。則東西兩廟市競售唐花。牡丹碧桃。栽入盆盎。以映椒盤。頓添者色。隨宫剪綵。方之爲拙矣。南州遠物。若橘柚天燭末利建蘭。值價甚高。培護梢一不周。輙復無幸。殆惟豪富之家方能育此。而藝之者終不絕也。至於太液夫容。顔色最豔。車行金鰲玉蝀崠橋畔。初日晚凉。儘人消受。不必池中蓄之。斯則南方所轉不逮。好事者喜於秋間爲菊會。標新領異。五色目迭。余嫌其變雅爲俗。稍失東籬眞逸自然之趣。冬之於梅亦然。藝梅之匠。俗骨難醫。好以梅枝屈就範。全不顧其横斜之態。余以爲北平園藝旣有發展之望。市民生計利賴實多。市當局宜獎勵其所已成。而誘導其所不及。凡顯與科學美術相背馳者。宜勸止之也。四時之豔。述之差備。尙有一物乃忘齒及。則俗所謂榆葉梅是也。其花兼有桃花海棠之姿。而甚易長肓。即詩所謂唐棣之華鄂不鞾者。他處罕見。故都獨多。</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>伊從來不會和丈夫吵嘴。也從來不會把丈夫的短處，完全告訴旁人，所以伊受到了這樣重大的剌激，仍不肯把汽車裏有個女人一事，告訴陳先生夫婦，伊只一味抑鬰地悲泣。但是陳先生夫，婦明知伊是爲了丈夫的關係而這樣的，只不便當了李先生的面講什麽。</p>
<p>李先生心裏狠氣憤妻子的氣量狹窄；同時又抱怨陳先生夫婦住在一家的屋子裏，怎的會放伊走到風雪裏去，鬧出這一件事來。他在外面的一切行爲，以爲任何人是不知道的，妻子當然也蒙在鼓裏，但是現在他狠担心，狠恐懼，因爲妻子已窺破了他的秘密，他也不敢說什麽話，只靜靜地抽着烟捲，坐在沙發上，沈機待變，正和敵軍的觀察對方動靜，以便抵抗。他在考慮，萬一妻子把這件秘密在許多人面前宣布出來，將取何種方策對付。閽捕走了以後，稍稍放下了一些心；李夫人老不開口，他又放下了一些心。</p>
<p>（伊什麽時候走出門去，我們都不曾聽得；外面風雪這麽大，伊跌在那裏的呢？）陳先生第一個打破了屋了裏靜寂的空氣而發問，差不多開始襲擊李先生。</p>
<p>（我今天因爲公司裏查一筆賬。做完已兩點半鐘，匆匆地雇了車子回來，想不到一下車便瞧見伊跌在雪中。蘭珍丨你怎的這樣没腦子似的，深夜跑出去？你眞傻！我又不是孩子難道也會被拐子拐去的麽？）李先生一面回答了陳先生。，接下去便埋怨他的妻子。李夫人心裏已是氣憤得非常，伊聽了丈夫的話。想把所見的宣布出來，但是一轉念聞，立刻變換了方針，伊覺得現在宣布了，他一定老羞成怒，夫婦的感情，也許立刻破裂，一發而不可收拾，還是是隱忍着使他自己良心發現，覺悟而回頭。但是伊更抑鬰了，哭得氣都轉不過來。李先生狠想用懷柔的方法，去假意安慰他夫人；只因平時擺慣丈夫架子的，突然在許多人而前，又不好意思和夫人温存，依舊抽他的烟捲。</p>

<p>— 甘</p>
<p>自汽車發明以來。爲時不過數十年。風起雲湧。佈遍全球。服務人羣。推爲近世唯一之代步利器。而歐美各國汽車製造器。著名之機械發明家。復不殫精力。悉心研究。以求汽車運用。臻於完滿境地。故自第一輛之汽車行世以來。比數十年中。種種改革進步之處。指不勝屈。考其動機約有三端。一、機械方面力求精緻。俾使用時之效率增長。添加速度而行動穩妥。此爲要之義。二、使有大量之出產。减低成本。以削售價。俾行銷普遍。而收廣佈之效。三、改更各種式樣顔色。以應社會之需要。而逹於美化之境。此三者雖不能於汽車進步之端由。概無括遺。然其犖犖大者。要亦相去不遠矣。</p>
<p>就近世商業之趨勢言。物品產生後之第一問題。厥爲如何而得盡量銷售。然欲求暢銷必先自需要始。譬如一輛汽車出廠後。公衆對之並無需要之象。則此一輛汽車之無從脫售殆無疑義矣。即就另一方面言。購買之羣衆或尙不知何者爲需要。此亦常有之一種現象也。但何者需要或不明瞭。而何者不需要。則其知之有素。當不待嘵舌而自明。姑舉一例。以證此說之非謬。設有某汽車廠者。製造一種新車。其發動及煞車均在一顆機鈕之中。便捷省事。得未曾有。此種新創當然爲公衆所需要。但此車未問世前。公衆方面或尙無此類需要之象。要亦非偶然之事。反之。又有一輛汽車。車身笨巨。行動遲緩。則此車不待問也。而購買之公衆已爲之却步矣。何者。因不需要也。</p>
<p>若干年前。汽車產量尙無近年之多。車身顔色極爲單調。祇有一種色澤。通常運用。而此一種常用之顔色。又爲黑色。單純滯呆。了無活潑之趣。然其時用車者安之若素。未聞有所不慣也。推其故。當以當時之汽車。速率穩妥兩大端。尙未臻完滿之境界。機器方面尙待革新考求者甚多。故一時於車身配色方面。程度未逹。尙談不到。降至今日。機構方面。進步改良之處已多。而公衆之需要汽車美化。亦爲顯見之象。因而車身顔色。配合調劑。力求美觀。輕清流麗。活潑地。試向各車廠一探。其所出之新車。大都具有各種顔色。待顧客之自擇。並能就客所好。定漆所嗜之色。汽車之進步。至此已逹成熟之途矣。</p>
<p>今當談汽車本身之汽缸問題。昔者汽車汽缸多爲四只。其後因公衆需要快速穩妥。於是六缸汽車應時而起。今則六缸之外。又需八缸。甚至十餘缸不等矣。拷汽缸之於汽車行動。有絕大之關係。當各車廠自四汽缸車改至六缸時。類多費去鉅萬之金錢。改造工廠及機械。今又欲從六缸改進爲八缸。則其所耗之金錢。又將不貲也。綜言之。此種改進之象雖係應時勢而趨進。然其要點則仍不外由購買者之殷需而起。而各廠出車旣多。競爭亦烈。乃不惜耗費鉅萬之金錢。以解决此類之切身問題也。</p>
<p>最後爲汽車之售價問題。一車旣成。即當銷售於買主。然如何而能引起顧客之注意。逹到銷售之目的。此亦堪以研究者。而其各種額外之費用。亦即隨之而起。故一車之造成。除其車身之成本不計外。又須添加若干之推銷費用。至於工廠方面之種種用途。則又爲必須之開銷。汽車即未售出。此項開支源源而起。不能或歇。猶之牛不耕種。亦需蒭蕘耳。基上述種種原委。汽車之售價問題。實爲各車廠之緊要事項。在昔產量較少。人工又巨。以其售價比之現在。實覺昻貴。今日各廠多採大量出產之方政。人工力求減輕。生產力則力求增加。故貨較從前爲精。而價格則反爲低落也。</p>

<h3 id="c222">桐渝路線選定 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 山浪</p>
<p>桐渝路爲川黔兩省陸路交能之幹線。經雙方迭次會商。川當局主以温水爲交點。黔地人士亦有贊同者。惟温水路線。僅川界稍平。黔界則大山横亘。用爲省道。實不相宜。黔當局特令桐渝公路勘測隊主任竇善祥。面謁川當局。商酌改點及會勘。當蒙允諾。派渝中測量隊申總工程師等。到松坎會同履勘。結果採用新松線。以崇溪溝爲川黔交點。現竇氏公畢回省。將其選定新松線理由與各路工程比較說明書發表。茲探録於下。</p>
<p>桐渝大道。原經新松。山勢高聳。險峻異常。凡經過者。均知馬路不能通行。當本隊未履勘以前。預料此段馬路路線。必須繞經温水。故逹到桐梓。即分途視察。往復履勘。一路由桐經九壩張楊壩温水石壕逹趕水。一路由桐經毛田楚米舖洛陽溪凉風埡花北坪天水池山坡新站松坎酒店埡觀音橋逹趕水。一路出羅溪溝夜即壩鹽巖小九盤逹趕水。又一路出麻柳楊村暗河花秋壋而下新站。再順河而出松坎釣魚洞而逹趕水。并於新松一線之炒米舖大坡及熊黄寺巴抓溪等處困難地段。復於其附近勘有比較線數條。經過數月之時間。各路踏勘之結果。新松舊道。固屬難於修築。而舊道附近。實有良好之路線。無論由路線長度上坡度上工程上經濟上以及沿途市鎭榮枯上比較。均較其他路線爲優渝中勘測隊實行履勘後。亦變更以温水爲交點之主張。而表示贊同。自新松路選定後。一般人士不驚異而懷疑。甚至有發生異議者。茲謹將履勘各路所得情形。比較得失。說明於後。以釋一般人之懷疑者。</p>
<p>（一）新松路綫此綫由桐城北門城邊。經毛田水磨塘三座寺楚米舖洛陽溪凉風埡牛滚蕩花秋坪鹿角山天水池鷹嘴巖土地平大窩蕩長子巖劉家山屯巖大茅坡山坡新站蒙渡草鞋埡九龍溝半坡青崗哨關口七陣溪城隍寺桑園壩凉風埡清水溪打寳舖松坎墳灣馬鞍山巴抓溪觀音巖韓家店巖頭上柏楊坪酒店埡大面坡逹崇溪溝。而接川境。全長一百六十里。路線平直。由桐城至楚米舖二十里。全係平坦。由土巖山不過十數丈。橋樑亦僅數丈寛之小橋三四座。由楚米舖斜上至花秋坪。又斜而逹山坡一段四十餘里。旣可將祖師觀石牛欄極大巖山避開。而坡度迤長。傾斜和緩。電光之形亦甚稀少。且十之八九。純係土質。巖山路線。不過十分之一。由山坡經新站至蒙渡二十里。路線平坦。石少土多。巖山地段。不過四五里。全係沙質。開鑿極易。且可利用蒙渡已之大橋减少數萬之橋工經費。由蒙渡斜上至草鞋埡。即順半山平過而逹青崗哨。再迤緩而下。逹七陣溪長二十里。九龍三溝之險阻。一變爲平坡之坦途。且半多泥土。巖係砂質。工作極易。由七陣溪直逹松坎。一段。長約三十里。亦屬平坦。田土尤多。巖山地段。僅城隍寺凉風埡清水溪歪岩子等處。每處巖長不過四十多丈。係砂質。費工不大。由松坎斜上酒店埡復下而至崇溪溝念八里。雖係坡度路線而傾斜和緩。電光之形亦屬甚少。土山路線約占十之八。巖山地段。僅馬鞍山巴抓溪。觀音巖頭上數處。合計不過四五里内鑿一丈寛之巖。外築數尺之堤路基。即可拚出。全線工程。以此爲巨。然亦不過費欵數萬。爲數無多。綜計全段路線。巖山路線。不過十分之一。土山路線。實占十分之九。民工便於工作。成功自屬較易。十餘里巖山。需欵亦只十一萬左右惟堤坎稍多。約需欵十三萬。至於橋樑。僅四十餘座。約需欵七萬元。合計不過三十餘萬元。故此線不獨路線直捷。工費兩省。且沿途市鎭繁密。較他線易於發展。即川境一時不通。我方祇須修抵松坎。即與水道　接。而獲水陸交通之便利。比之其他各綫。優點實多。故新松一綫。實有採用之價值。</p>
<p>（二）與温水線之比較此線係由桐梓官渡河起點。順桐赤馬路路線。經楊柳坪九壩張楊壩而逹温水。再由温水分道。經石濠而逹趕水。桐温一段路線。大半均已挖成。僅由温水新修三十里。即接川界。在未勘測之前。川黔兩方當局。及雙方測量人員。均預料桐渝路線之必出此。川方并有以温水爲交界點之决定。乃履勘結果。此線全長較新松線長百二三十里。川黔各長一站。且路線不良。在川境。雖稍平坦。而在黔。境路線。除張揚壩經温水到川境一段稍平外。其張揚壩到桐百餘里。全係重山峻嶺。横亘其間。路線起伏旣大。電光之形尤多。且傾斜之度復大。多超過百分之十以上者。用爲省道。實不相宜。不如新松線之置捷而曲折較少也。即以工程而論。土工工作雖已成過半。然尙有毫未工作。純係荒坡者。且經此數年雨水之冲剔。恐不過半數之工程。桐温間二百里馬路。舊有人道。只二站馬路。曲折實有三站餘之補修工程。及温水以外三十里之新修工程。合計幾與新松全線之新修工程相等。而橋樑涵洞巖堤等特别工程毫未着手。據貴赤路工程主任此次之估計。桐梓縣境特工經費須二十九萬。　水縣境需七十餘萬。依此則由桐境到温水最少須三十萬。加以温水至川境。亦須四五萬。合計各段所需特工經費約需六十餘萬。較之新松一線所需之三十餘萬相差一倍。孰得孰失。不言可知。且温線即使修成。對於車輛運輸多費。時財兩不經濟。而人馬通行。恐必仍由捷徑。將來運輸上及沿途地方上之發展。恐無絕大希望也。故桐渝線之不由此而由新松。實具有絕大理由。非選擇失當也。（未完）</p>

<p>此後戰事的發展繫於聨隊司令和各師長的努力、以及士卒的用命、</p>
<p>九月廿六日、猛烈砲繫之後、美第一軍即隨之在上午五時卅分鐘、法第四軍在上午五時廿五分鐘、分頭開始（Ｂ）（Ｃ）攻勢戰、全綫攻擊部隊立即在苗斯河和綏浦河之間進展、佔領敵軍第一道防綫、平均進展二三英里、</p>
<p>爲緊隨戰事發展起見、我便在廿六日午後移駐特樂亞方敦别墅、（聖狄齊歐之北、）廿七日也留在那裏、日間我往納當谷訪貝當司令、更到歇龍聖蒙梅高樂將軍的司令部、</p>
<p>廿七廿八兩天、敵軍頑抗不退、法第四軍在丕河流域德軍防綫相持、美第一軍因突遭亞崗河方面側擊、遂在阿普爾蒙周圍停頓、</p>
<p>九月廿九日、法第四軍集中中路猛撲、攻破丕河之綫、把敵軍擊退至沙姆河丕河和蒙沙亞間的第二綫、但美軍被困於苗斯河和亞岡河之間、其地甚狹、更以山川縱横行軍不易、亞岡河方面和苗斯河東岸均有敵軍側擊仍是一籌莫展、美軍想增加第一綫的兵力以戰勝這些困難、結果非但勞而無功、該軍前後呼應反因之不靈、各路交通也歸斷絕、</p>
<p>我爲補救形勢起見、遂與貝當司令同意、决定從美軍前綫撤退幾師、一部調往苗斯河之東、一部開往亞岡河之西、並主張把他們編入前綫的法軍聨隊、以免曠費時日、苗斯河兩岸的法美部隊歸潘興司令指揮、另委一法軍長（第二軍）指揮亞岡河兩岸的聨軍、（未完）</p>

In reality, the water has receded in You and Shao, but the disaster in Zhengtai is worsening. Disaster victims are everywhere, eagerly awaiting rescue. Many disaster victims from Xingdong have come to Taixian to seek refuge. Since they are all disaster victims, it is inappropriate to discriminate. They are also being sheltered together.

The disaster situation in Gaoyou and Shaobo is particularly tragic. Although philanthropists and charitable organizations from various places have provided emergency relief, the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large, making it difficult to reach everyone. Along the way, we learned that some people are only able to get one meal a day, others are only able to get one or two bread cakes, and some are even hungry all day without a single meal. The plight of the refugees is indescribable. If relief is sought within the disaster area, the financial resources will be insufficient. We grieve for these survivors who did not die when the dikes collapsed, but are dying now as the floodwaters recede. We, Yihan and others, are deeply saddened and concerned. We humbly appeal to all charitable organizations and philanthropists to have compassion for those who are hungry and drowning, and to donate grain or funds so that the people in the disaster area will not be without food."

<h3 id="e26">Appeal for Peace <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>A catastrophic flood has inundated the mainland. Southeast, northwest, everywhere is filled with weeping. Ten million disaster victims are floating in the water, eagerly awaiting the government and the people to extend their helping hands to relieve their dire situation. At this time, when the country is like a pile of eggs and the people are suffering beyond endurance, there are sudden reports of the Guangdong-Guangxi conflict, and the situation has suddenly become tense. The struggle between political parties will ultimately resort to war. The water calamity has not ended, and a war calamity is about to begin. The dying people, hearing this bad news, feel the coming calamity even more strongly and cannot bear it for a moment. Considering the country's danger and the people's plight, which cannot withstand another war, we dare to appeal for peace with our last remaining blood and tears.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, political changes have occurred repeatedly. The traces of war are still visible in Jiangnan and Hebei. We often endure short-term suffering in the revolutionary process, looking forward to the future. Enduring reality is also the way the authorities often proclaim to the whole country, advising the people to endure the suffering in the process. However, today, natural disasters and man-made disasters have come one after another. This flood is an unprecedented catastrophe in a century. Half the country is submerged, and hundreds of millions of people have become food for fish. North of the Yellow River and south of the Yangtze River, one can only see huge waves hitting the sky and hear crying echoing in the fields. People and animals are swept away, and fields and houses are destroyed. The country's vitality has been lost. The remnants of life after the calamity have only a breath left. The people at this time have no food to eat and no place to be buried. At this critical moment of survival, how can we not urgently seek to care for the dead and dying disaster victims, but instead cut the wounds even deeper, throw stones into the well after someone has fallen, and consign the line of national life and the breath of the people that have not been extinguished by the flood to war?</p>
<p>Today, those who advocate saving the country are driven by their passion for loving the country and the party. Although there are slight differences in opinion, the purpose is the same. Since the purpose is none other than saving the country and the people, then in the current situation where the country is in danger and the people are suffering, the internal disputes of the party can be resolved within the party. Why must we start a war and sacrifice the country and the people for the party? Recently, British Prime Minister MacDonald, in the face of the country's crisis, sacrificed his party's views and devoted his efforts to the country. This is because the party is attached to the country, and if the country does not exist, where will the party be attached? We must clearly recognize this meaning now. Secondly, the country's politics urgently need to be reformed, but in this time of crisis, why can we not work together openly and honestly to seek reform? Moreover, the people are drowning in the flood, enduring death and waiting for rescue. Weighing the importance and urgency, saving the disaster victims is an urgent task recognized by the country and the international community. If we take lightly what is important and value what is light, ignoring the millions of disaster victims, then will there be any survivors or complete land under the gunfire? Moreover, the neighbor to the east is watching covetously, waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of us. The Wanpaoshan Incident and the Korean Incident have not yet been resolved, and the voices of active aggression continue to be heard. If a civil war breaks out, foreign aggression will follow, and the disaster will be unbearable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, now that millions of people are drowning and urgently need rescue, and the national treasury is exhausted and raising funds is difficult, if a military campaign is launched, military supplies must be collected in cash and purchased from foreign countries, taking away the disaster victims' food to buy bullets for killing people and fighting on the battlefield, poisoning our compatriots. Wherever the shells fall, blood and flesh will fly. Who does not have parents, who does not have a wife and children? Thinking of this, how can we not feel deeply saddened? Water, drought, and war have continued for years. The people have suffered enough. What more do we seek now? We only hope to stop man-made disasters so that we can live in peace and so that the old and weak will not end up in ditches and the young and strong will not become refugees on the roads. This is the minimum hope, but can we bear to deny it? Although the years of chaos have not been accidental, they all have their causes. How to reform politics is the fundamental task of ending chaos. From now on, our people should unite sincerely and work together to cleanse and purify, wash away the dirt and repent. We should only seek to benefit the country and the people, without considering anything else, and work together to rescue the disaster victims, suppress bandits, and resist the strong, so that politics can become clear, the national foundation can become stable, and the people can have a chance to recover. Otherwise, the long night and the country's future will never dawn. Today is the anniversary of Mr. Sun Zhongshan's first revolution. Mr. Sun's spirit of fighting to save the country and the nation is still alive today. In this difficult time, recalling the difficulties of the revolutionary pioneers, we feel even more tearful and unable to control ourselves. Those who follow Mr. Sun should remember this.</p>

Zou Zuohua has arrived in Paris and is expected to return home by the end of the year. Regarding the Nakamura Incident, based on my judgment, it is definitely not the case.

<p>Cabinet Hears Report from Army Minister</p>
<p>Various Circles Loudly Advocate Tough Diplomacy</p>
<p>Leaflets Scattered from the Air to Incite Anti-Chinese Sentiment</p>
<p>New Foreign Insults Follow One After Another</p>
<p>Countrymen, Wake Up Quickly!!</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 8th - Anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan is growing daily, so many believe that the relationship between the two countries will be in a dangerous situation unless there is an unexpected development that turns adversity into prosperity. Even members of the Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party) now disagree on whether Japan should continue to pursue the policy of patience and moderation toward China that Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara established when he took office. While many supporters of the government believe that the military leaders' advocacy of a tough policy should be criticized, they also believe that Shidehara's policy is now as unpopular as the positive policy implemented by Prime Minister Tanaka a few years ago, so the government should choose a middle ground policy. Although there are many who agree with this proposal, influential political circles are gradually believing that if Japan does not take a tough stance on the Nakamura murder case in Mongolia and other Sino-Japanese disputes, China will continue its so-called policy of delay. It is said that there are currently as many as 300 Sino-Japanese disputes awaiting resolution. Japanese fanatics now say that a few years ago, the Soviet Union adopted a moderate policy toward China, which resulted in a daily decline in the prestige of the Soviet Union in the Far East, until the Soviet Union suddenly changed its policy due to the Middle East Railway case and went to war with China in Manchuria, and then was able to hold a meeting in Moscow to resolve years of outstanding issues. Japan should now take Russia as an example and adopt a more active policy to resolve many controversial issues between China and Japan. The cabinet held a meeting today to discuss the fact that the Chinese authorities have not given a satisfactory reply to the Nakamura murder case and decided to determine the countermeasures based on the results of the second investigation currently being conducted by the Chinese authorities. It also passed a resolution stating that if China does not promptly and sincerely conduct a thorough investigation, the Japanese military and diplomatic authorities should jointly decide on countermeasures. Yesterday, six army planes in the Kanazawa area, under the command of the local division headquarters, dropped countless leaflets in the air, warning the people that Japan's special rights and interests in Manchuria are now in danger. Some circles do not approve of this move. When asked, the Ministry of the Army said that the leaflets did not contain any inflammatory content, but were only intended to remind the people of the importance of national defense.</p>

<p>Continuing Foreign News Dispatches</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th - At today's regular cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Wakatsuki requested Foreign Minister Shidehara to report on the progress of the negotiations on the Nakamura Incident. Foreign Minister Shidehara reported that the Chinese side had conducted the first investigation into Japan's protest and learned that a Japanese person was kidnapped by Chinese people near the Nen River, but the circumstances at the scene were unclear. After further negotiations, the Chinese side will send a second investigation team, with considerable figures going along this time, so it should be possible to clarify the situation in general. Next, Army Minister Minami reported that although more than one person saw Captain Nakamura being killed, if their names were announced, they would be killed by the Chinese side, so the army is now working to collect more evidence. As for material evidence, Captain Nakamura's gold watch and other items were reportedly taken by Han Yugou, the commander of the Third Regiment of the Reclamation Army. The Chinese side's investigation may not be able to clarify the circumstances of the massacre, but the army will take appropriate measures. Today's cabinet meeting only listened to the report on the Nakamura Incident and did not discuss the final policy.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Seoul, 8th - Colonel Doihara, who will return to Japan to report on the Nakamura Incident, stated this afternoon that the Chinese side is delaying negotiations in order to destroy evidence, but the Japanese side has both material and testimonial evidence to present. It seems that the Chinese side views Japan as unable to take any action due to its economic situation, but I will report the progress of the negotiations to my province and listen to the final instructions.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th - The Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party) held an executive meeting on the afternoon of the 8th. Secretary-General Yamamichi stated regarding the establishment of a special committee on diplomacy toward China that there have been many recent advocates of tough diplomacy on the Manchurian and Mongolian issues. The Minseito's foreign policy is also the same in protecting rights and interests. It is now studying future policies toward China, so it intends to establish a special committee on diplomacy toward China. There was no dissent from the floor, and it was resolved. Tawarā Sunichi was appointed as the chairman, and Soeda, Kato, Masuda, Nakano, Nagai, Nakamura, and Ishizuka were appointed as members.</p>

<p>Emergency Budget to be Proposed for Discussion Tomorrow</p>
<p>Labor Unions Convene, Strong Anti-Government Sentiment</p>
<p>British Monarch Willing to Reduce Royal Expenses to Lead the Nation</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 8th - British Prime Minister MacDonald issued a letter to the nation last night, saying, "I ask the nation to trust me and not to hold incorrect notions in their minds, thinking that the current crisis is not real, is not dangerous, and can be dealt with casually without the active measures that the government is now asking Parliament to approve." Parliament reopened this afternoon, first reading the King's Speech and then voting. It is expected that the government will receive a majority of more than just fifty or sixty votes, because many Labor Party members are unwilling to have their names published on the voting list, so there will be many temporary absences. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden will propose the emergency budget on Thursday. Six hundred representatives of the Labor Party are currently participating in the Trades Union Congress in Bristol. The congress was opened yesterday by Labor MP Hardie, whose opening remarks made fierce attacks on his so-called financiers and declared his consistent opposition to the policies of the National Government. Today, Trades Union Congress Secretary Citrine gave an impassioned speech and reported on his meeting with MacDonald when the new government was being formed, saying that MacDonald's remarks to the responsible groups that day were dismissive and unheard of. MacDonald stated the general financial difficulties but did not mention a word about the facts and measures under consideration, only saying equal sacrifices, nothing more. Then he sat down. When someone asked a question, Snowden gave a speech, but did not say a word about cutting unemployment benefits. The Labor Party representatives who attended the meeting were all indignant.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 7th - British King George today sent a letter to Prime Minister MacDonald, stating that he is willing to reduce royal expenses by 50,000 pounds annually during the period of austerity. Although the expense reduction will require the suspension of some court ceremonies or the termination of employment of some royal servants, after repeated consideration, 50,000 pounds in expenses can be reduced annually through active frugality. In addition, members of the royal family are all willing to cut their expenses during the emergency period. The annual allowance approved by Parliament for the British monarch is 470,000 pounds, with the following items: Expenses for the King and Queen, 110,000 pounds; royal salaries, 125,800 pounds; royal expenses, 193,000 pounds; projects, 20,000 pounds; royal rewards, 13,200 pounds; miscellaneous expenses, 8,000 pounds. The Crown Prince also informed the Prime Minister that he is willing to donate 10,000 pounds annually from his income. The Crown Prince can earn approximately 70,000 pounds annually from the Duchy of Cornwall, so this 10,000 pounds is the Crown Prince's personal donation. The Prime Minister has now replied to the British Monarch, saying that every time the people are about to undertake sacrifices, His Majesty takes the lead in advocating them. Now, when all classes of the country must join in common sacrifices, seeing His Majesty's example will surely be inspiring. In 1916, the British Monarch voluntarily donated 100,000 pounds to cover national expenses.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 8th - The royal expenses were stipulated in 1910, when the value of the currency was higher than today. Now, the British Monarch's voluntary sacrifice of a portion of the expenses, accounting for more than one-eleventh of the total, is praised by all newspapers, saying that it is a touching action by the British Monarch, making people aware that resolving the current crisis is more important than partisan politics. After the war, the cost of living was expensive, and the British Monarch was greatly affected. He raised 100,000 pounds himself to cover the deficit and declined the government's suggestion to increase the royal expenses.</p>

The motion was then submitted to the parliament for discussion. When the League of Nations was established in 1919, Mexico did not participate because it had a pro-German attitude during the European War.</p>
<h3 id="e59">British Indian Round Table Conference Federal Structure Committee Meets <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 7th - The Federal Structure Committee of the Indian Round Table Conference reconvened today at St. James's Palace in London to continue the discussions from seven months ago. Lord Sankey, the Lord Chancellor, is still the chairman. Prime Minister MacDonald, in his capacity as chairman of the Round Table Conference, gave a speech welcoming the Indian representatives and stated that the changes in the British political situation do not hinder Britain's determination to bring the conference work to a successful conclusion. He said that this year the representatives will definitely be united by the spirit of friendship and understanding as they were last year. Chairman Sankey gave a speech, hoping for the success of the conference, and said that if the discussions in the next few weeks fail to achieve close understanding among the participants, such an opportunity will not be seen in the future. Various speakers expressed optimism that the current difficulties could be resolved. Conservative Hoare also shared the same view, and his remarks had a dual meaning, as he was both a member of the new government and a Conservative representative attending the conference. Former Labor Party cabinet member Benn said that as far as the new Labor Party in Parliament is concerned, there has been no change in the status of India. The Indian speakers welcomed the promises of the representatives of various parties and expressed their belief that this conference can achieve results, so that the Indian people and the British Empire will both receive the trust of lasting benefits. The Federal Structure Committee has 31 members, and only half of them attended today, while the rest are still on their way from India. Gandhi is also a member and is expected to arrive in London by the end of this week. The date of the reopening of the entire Round Table Conference has not yet been set and depends on the progress of the work of the Structure Committee and the Minorities Committee. Indian representatives who do not need to attend the above two committees must arrive in London before the end of October. The previous Round Table Conference adjourned on January 19 this year.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanchang, addressed to all newspapers: "I have just sent a telegram to General Commander Yu to General Commander Chiang in Nanjing. I respectfully read Your Excellency's telegram of September 1, announcing to the nation the elimination of internal spies, the suppression of the Red Army, and disaster relief. It was benevolent, compassionate, and heartfelt. All of us in the command were inspired. I believe that at a time when foreign aggression and internal turmoil are intertwined, and natural and man-made disasters are extraordinary events, all of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor should be willing to endure hardship, share weal and woe, and overcome difficulties together. However, a few unscrupulous elements in Guangdong and Guangxi are obstinate, determined to go their own way, and are using their opportunistic and conspiratorial minds to carry out acts of betraying the party and the country. They have lost all conscience and integrity and are sparing no effort to prevent our country and nation from falling into an abyss of no return. We are subordinate to the central government and cherish unity and peace. If anyone is willing to do evil, destroy unity and peace, and obstruct the suppression of the Red Army and disaster relief, we vow to follow Your Excellency and work together to the end. As long as there is a breath of life, this aspiration will never change. I respectfully submit this sincere message and beg Your Excellency to take it under advisement." (Signed) He Yingqin, Chen Mingshu, Lu Diping, Zhu Shaoliang, Sun Lianzhong, Jiang Guangnai, Jiang Dingwen, Zhao Guantao, Chen Cheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, Cai Tingkai, Tan Daoyuan, Hao Mengling, Wei Lihuang, Gao Shuxun, Lu Xiaochen, Zhou Hunyuan, Mao Bingwen, Wei Zhuoying, Li Yunjie, Xu Kexiang, Gong Bingfan, Guo Huazong, Han Deqin, Li Yunheng, Ruan Zhaochang, Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, Zhang Zhen, Liu Heding, Luo Lin, Zhu Xihuang, Qiu Zhaohuan, Tang Enbo, Liu Yi, Ma Kuntong.</p>
<p>A telegram from Jinan, addressed to all newspapers: "Continuous rain has caused disasters, and floods have inundated the Jianghuai River basin, with disaster areas as large as sixteen provinces. Hundreds of thousands of people have no means to survive if they live, and no means to bury if they die. Disaster relief and helping neighbors have become major issues today. Thirty-seven counties in our province, including Jinan, Ningyang, and Liaocheng, have also been hit by disasters at the same time. Resources and livestock have all been lost to the waves, and homes, graves and fields have all become swamps. The number of people affected by the disaster and who have lost their lives cannot be counted. Those who were fortunate enough to survive are displaced and wandering, and the cries of misery can be heard everywhere. It is truly tragic to speak of. After deliberation, the Shandong Provincial Government decided to form the Shandong National Flood Emergency Relief Association on the 4th of this month and set up a branch in the Provincial Government. With the intention of regarding the hunger and drowning of others as if it were our own, we are taking collective action in the hope of rescuing the disaster victims and jointly averting this great catastrophe. However, from the current situation, our province cannot even take care of itself, let alone care for others. However, in view of the great righteousness involved, we must not only save ourselves, but also think of helping others, and together sprinkle millet porridge and benevolence on the people. In addition to collecting relief funds, which will be remitted to the Central Government for distribution, we hereby send this telegram for your information." (Signed) Shandong National Flood Emergency Relief Association.</p>
<p>A telegram from Harbin, addressed to all newspapers: "I have just replied to Vice Commander of the Army, Navy and Air Force Zhang Yi, which reads, 'I respectfully read the telegram from Jiang and saw that Your Excellency hates to hear of wars and promotes peace. Your words are earnest and I am filled with admiration. I believe that today, internal and external troubles are coming one after another, and man-made and natural disasters are shocking. At this time of national crisis, we should uphold the friendship of being in the same boat and facing the same storm. I and others love the people and the country, so how dare we lag behind? With one heart and one mind, we are willing to share this aspiration. I respectfully send this telegram in reply and beg Your Excellency to take it under advisement.' I am sending this telegram to you for your information and respectfully ask for your instructions."

<h3 id="e63">The Executive Yuan's 38th National Affairs Meeting <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Passed the Draft of Implementing Regulations for the Education Association Law</p>
<p>Revised the Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration in Hangzhou City</p>
<p>On the 8th in the morning, the Executive Yuan held its 38th National Affairs Meeting. Li Shuhua, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, and Lian Shenghai were present. Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zheng Hongnian, and Zhang Wohua attended as observers. Secretary-General Lü Bíchóu and Director of Political Affairs Xu Jingzhi were also present. Wang Zhengting chaired the meeting, and the following matters were discussed: (1) The Ministry of Education submitted a report stating that, in accordance with the Education Association Law and the Party Headquarters' guidelines on reorganizing and organizing education associations, it had drafted the Implementing Regulations for the Education Association Law. However, it was noted that the number of representatives stipulated in Article 5 of the Party Headquarters' guidelines on reorganizing and organizing education associations – two from district education associations and one from county/city education associations – seemed too few. Therefore, Article 15 of the Implementing Regulations had been moderately increased to facilitate the association's work. The draft was copied and submitted for review and approval. The resolution was to approve the draft, to be promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and to be submitted to the record for future reference. (2) The Ministry of Industry proposed that, according to reports from the Zhejiang Provincial Certified Public Accountants Association and the Lixin Certified Public Accountants Office in Hangzhou, the Hangzhou Municipal Government, based on the Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Registration in Hangzhou City, was handling industrial and commercial registration matters in a manner that conflicted with central laws and regulations. The Ministry requested that the Executive Yuan be petitioned to promptly order corrections. Upon reviewing these registration regulations, it was confirmed that they significantly conflicted with the current Company Law, the Implementing Law of the Company Law, the Trademark Law, the Company Registration Rules, and the Provisional Rules for Commercial Registration. It was found that the industrial and commercial registration matters of various provincial and municipal governments should be handled in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, and separate regulations that conflict with the aforementioned laws should not be created. It was proposed to instruct the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order the cancellation of the aforementioned registration regulations. As other local governments might have similar situations, it was also requested to issue a general prohibition to maintain the integrity of government orders. A resolution was passed to handle the matter according to the Ministry's proposal. (3) It was resolved to approve the resignation of Wen Yuqing, a counselor of the Ministry of Finance, due to illness. It was proposed to promote Deng Mianren, the secretary of the Ministry, to fill the vacancy.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Chu Minyi Reports on the Northwest Expedition <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Delayed Telegrams Were the Cause of Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Crawler Cars Are an Effective Tool for Northwest Transportation</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, the head of the Chinese delegation of the Sino-French Scientific Expedition Team of 1929, traveled to Xinjiang from Beiping (Beijing) in crawler cars. During the journey, the event of the French member, Buan, insulting Chinese members occurred, which was opposed by the Chinese people and led to repeated telegrams from the central government to stop the team from continuing the expedition. Chu departed from Dihua (Ürümqi) on August 11th, returned to China via Russia through the Siberian Railway, and arrived in Beiping at 10:15 AM on the 4th. Yesterday (the 5th) at 3:00 PM, the Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities held a meeting in the committee's building in Tuancheng to welcome him. The chairman of the committee, Zhang Ji, and committee members Li Yuying, Xu Bingchang, and Liu Fu were present. After Zhang Ji gave a welcoming speech, Chu stood up and gave a detailed report. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Round Trip Route The chairman and distinguished committee members, I, Minyi, was ordered to go to Xinjiang for an expedition. I arrived in Beiping yesterday morning via Russia from Xinjiang. Originally, I intended to return directly to Shanghai to attend my father's funeral upon arriving in Shenyang. However, because Vice Commander Zhang, Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Zhang Puquan, and many friends are in Beiping, I came to Beiping for a day or two. After arriving in Beiping yesterday, I read newspaper articles about the 1929 scientific expedition, which contained many misunderstandings. Today, I am fortunate to have this opportunity to report to your esteemed committee. Minyi and his team left Zhangjiakou on May 20th, arrived at Bailingmiao on the 22nd, and began the journey west on crawler cars with the French team members on the 26th. On June 1st, the incident of Buan insulting Mr. Hao Jingsheng occurred in Hami. Mr. Zhou Junbao and Han Sui accompanied Mr. Hao and retreated. On June 1st, a small part of the team arrived in Suzhou (Jiuquan) first to pick up gasoline. Most of the team arrived after June 15th and declared a temporary cessation of cooperation. On June 20th, seven articles of a continued cooperation agreement were signed. On June 21st, they advanced around Anxi. On the evening of June 26th, they received a wireless telegram, learning the painful news of my father's death. At that time, they had already gone deep into the desert. There was no way to return, and I had to bear the pain and continue westward. On June 28th, they arrived in Hami, staying for three days. On July 1st, they departed, arriving in Turpan on the 5th, staying for one day. On the 7th, they arrived in Dihua, staying for thirty-five days. On August 11th, they left Dihua. On the 15th, they arrived in Tacheng, staying for six days. On August 21st, they left Tacheng, passing through Russia. On August 25th, they arrived in Ayaguz. On the 26th, they took a train. On the 27th, they arrived in Semey. On the 28th, they boarded the Siberian Railway. On September 1st, they arrived in Manchuria Station (Manzhouli), and on the 2nd, they arrived in Shenyang, staying for one night. Yesterday morning, they arrived in Beiping. This is the round trip route that Minyi took, drawing a large circle in northern Asia. ▲ Telegram Mishaps When I arrived in Dihua, I only received two telegrams forwarded by the provincial government: (1) A telegram from the Executive Yuan dated July 3rd regarding the resolution on our team, prohibiting the expedition and protecting their exit. (2) A telegram from the Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities dated June 21st, which mentioned a telegram addressed to Minyi personally. However, this telegram was not received. Later, I received two telegrams from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one telegram from President Cai of the Academia Sinica, and one telegram from President Chiang, all conveying the Executive Yuan's resolution. As for the various concerns, suspicions, and misunderstandings in the country, I only learned about them in Shenyang and Beiping, discovering that there was much commotion. However, at the time, Minyi had no knowledge of it. The committee's telegram regarding the incident of insulting Chinese members advocated for the removal of Buan and instructed Minyi to carry it out. This coincided with the seven articles of the continued cooperation agreement that Minyi signed in Suzhou. However, the two telegrams, sent simultaneously, arrived more than ten days apart because telegrams were sometimes sent via wire and sometimes via wireless. Wireless communication required the assistance of the French team, while wired communication had to go to a telegraph office. Wireless was faster, while wired was slower, causing a large discrepancy in timing. Also, telegrams were sometimes sent in foreign languages, which were easily mistranslated. For example, Minyi's telegram reported that Buan was willing to sacrifice himself and not be the team leader, but the sentence "sacrifice himself" was translated as "a harmonious attitude." As a result, it was said that Minyi was praising Buan and intentionally pleading for Buan. Telegrams were like this, and letters were even more difficult. A letter that Minyi sent from Suzhou arrived in the interior only after a long delay. We originally knew that communication in the Northwest was difficult, so we were determined to improve it. Now, because of the difficulty of communication and the lack of information, some people with heightened sensitivity suspected Minyi of remaining silent on matters of great importance to the Chinese people, finding it strange and even mocking him as a foreigner. Minyi's personal grievances are not worth mentioning. The truth will be revealed eventually. However, those who amplify the words and try to undermine the expedition with various methods have other motives. As for the incident of Mr. Hao being beaten, the perpetrator Buan will soon return to Beiping. A thorough investigation can only be conducted when both parties are present. If the plaintiff and defendant are tens of thousands of miles apart, how can a telegram be used to instruct the New Province to investigate? Buan's beating of someone is naturally wrong. Both parties must be present to discuss the matter. Minyi can also serve as a notary in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Inspection Situation As for the French team members, they are currently staying in Dihua, planning to meet up with a team coming from the west before returning to Beiping from Xinjiang. This expedition faced many twists and turns before it even set off. Minyi was recommended by the Chinese Academic Association to be the team leader and dared not refuse, willing to take on the challenge. At the same time, he also received orders from the central government to inspect Party affairs in Xinjiang, so he had to reach his destination before reporting back. As for the scientific expedition, although Sino-French cooperation did not last to the end, during the journey, many of our team members conducted various inspections along the way. In Xinjiang, they were able to inspect as much as possible. (A detailed report will be given separately.) It cannot be said that the Chinese side was not successful in some way. (To be continued.)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Recent News of the Floods in Hubei Province <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Relief Teams Depart to Various Counties to Aid Refugees</p>
<p>Bridge Completion in Hankou, Drainage Being Planned</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This time, the floods in Wuhan have spread throughout the province. The extent of the disaster area and the number of victims have surpassed previous records. Although the water level has receded slightly, the suffering of the people remains. The urgent tasks are to provide relief, prevent epidemics, and restore transportation. It is not yet time to discuss post-disaster recovery extravagantly. The Hubei branch of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters is aware of this, so the current work is focused on addressing the immediate symptoms. For example, in terms of relief, in addition to accommodating as many refugees as possible in Wuhan and providing food and clothing, the severity of the disaster in each county is assessed separately for relief efforts. In addition, Yang Zigong, the chairman of the Northeast Four Provinces Charitable Federation, organized a relief team. The first team, led by Yang, departed for Xindi on the 7th. The second team departed for Fankou on the 8th. Both teams used large barges to transport large quantities of white rice, flour, medicines, etc., which were distributed on the spot. The remaining counties will be handled in order. In terms of epidemic prevention, Wuhan is still mainly handled by the office in Hubei established by the Central Health Administration. The outer counties are handled by the disaster relief branch, which sends personnel to assist. The branch is divided into three sections: one is the medical section, which handles the affairs of temporary hospitals, hospitals for serious illnesses, and treatment centers in various shelters; the second is the epidemic prevention section, which handles inspection affairs, nutritional diseases, and vaccinations; and the third is the sanitation engineering team, which handles cleaning and sanitation, water purification, and food inspection. Another large health team is organized to step up work separately. Currently, many refugees in Wuhan are infected with diseases, most commonly typhoid fever, dysentery, and malaria. The most deaths are among children. However, cholera and acute infectious diseases have not yet been found, perhaps due to the clear effects of epidemic prevention work. In terms of transportation, the areas outside the county that were flooded are still a vast expanse of water, making it impossible to restore transportation for the time being. However, Hankou, where the essence is concentrated, must be planned first. The first step is to build a bridge, which was completed on the 7th. The area from Hubei Street to Zhongshan Road is now passable. The long bridge lying on the waves, the complex road traversing the sky, is indeed a fitting poem for this time. The second step is to drain the accumulated water. The disaster relief branch has agreed with the general headquarters and the Junpu Bureau of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission to borrow pumps from Shanghai for use in Hankou. The Yangtze River Conservancy Commission has appointed engineers Lin and Hu to assist in Hankou. It is expected to be ready within ten days and completely drained within two weeks.

<h3 id="e66">He Jian Inspects Flood-stricken Counties <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian, accompanied by Zhou Yikui, a special commissioner sent by the central government to Hunan to inspect the flood disaster, Cao Bowen, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Chen Zongxiang, an engineer for disaster investigation, Lian Bishan, a technical expert from the Department of Civil Affairs, Cao Zonghai, a technical expert from the Department of Construction, Peng Maoyuan, the director of the Relief Committee, and others, went to the counties most severely affected by the disaster on the 31st of last month to inspect the flood disaster. It was originally intended to inspect Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Changde, Anxiang, Nanxian, Huarong, Fengxian, Yiyang, Xiangyin, Linxiang, Yueyang, and other counties, as well as the Jinggang area, before returning to the province. However, on the evening of the 3rd, an urgent telegram was received in Anxiang stating that the Guangdong-Guangxi armies had the appearance of invading Hunan, that the defense of southern Hunan was tight, and that He should return to the province early to preside over military affairs. He returned to the province by special ship from Anxiang on the 4th. All counties that had not been inspected were continued by Director Cao of the Department of Civil Affairs accompanied by Commissioner Zhou and others. It is reported that He and his party traveled by four small steamships from the province. On the evening of the 31st of last month, they arrived in Yuanjiang. They landed at 5:00 AM the next morning to inspect the disaster in the suburbs and finished at 8:00 AM. They returned to the ship at 10:00 AM and sailed to Hanshou, arriving at 4:00 PM. They immediately landed to inspect everything and finished at 6:00 PM. They attended a welcoming meeting at the county Party headquarters. They stayed in Hanshou that night. On the morning of the 2nd, they went to Changde at 6:00 AM. Due to the large waves along the way, they did not arrive in Changde until 2:00 PM. After landing, they inspected the flood disaster at the east and west gates. Then, they inspected the fortress project. On the morning of the 3rd, they sailed to Anxiang at 5:00 AM, arriving at 6:00 PM. They landed at the county Party headquarters and talked with representatives of various legal entities, and inquired about the suppression of bandits from Ma Kunshan, the deputy division commander of the 11th Division stationed in Anxiang. They returned to the ship at 9:00 PM. They originally planned to inspect Jinfeng the next day, but because they received a telegram from the province urging them to return, they returned to the province on the morning of the 4th at 5:00 AM, arriving at 10:00 PM that night. Among the inspections, the disaster in Yuanjiang was the most severe, with all the dikes and embankments in the county submerged, no harvest in the farmland, a loss of 5 to 6 million shi of grain, and tens of thousands of houses destroyed. The number of disaster victims is about 500,000 or more. Changde is the second most severely affected, followed by Anxiang and Hanshou. Currently, the water level on both sides has not fully receded.

<h3 id="e67">The Southern and Northern Maoyou Dams in Jiangsu Have Been Opened <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Water Level in the Lower Reaches of the Canal is Falling Daily</p>
<p>But Yi River Suddenly Reported to Be Discharging Again</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Yesterday, the provincial government received a telegram from the Dongtai Dafeng Company stating that the Southern and Central Maoyou dams had been opened, and the Northern Maoyou dam was being strongly urged to be opened by tenant farmers at the cost of their autumn harvest. They requested that troops not be deployed to suppress them and that funds be allocated quickly for work-relief programs. The original telegram is recorded below: (Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Telegraph Bureau, and transferred to Mr. Leng Yuqiu: Your telegrams of winter are respectfully acknowledged. The situation of the opening of the southern and central Maoyou dams has been respectfully reported in the winter. The northern Maoyou dam is also being strongly urged to be opened by tenant farmers who are willing to endure the pain and sacrifice the autumn harvest, and it was opened yesterday morning. There is no need for troops to suppress them. If troops have already been deployed, please request their withdrawal. At present, the water level is rising continuously. We are urging tenant farmers day and night to rush to repair the inner river in the hope of avoiding a common catastrophe. There are many disaster victims from outside the area who are being transported by the company's hired boats to within the area. They are crying for food and are in a pitiful state. The company's three dams are fully open, but the discharge of water is limited because the beaches are high and there are not many ports. Please allocate funds quickly to carry out work-relief programs and build more seaports to increase the flow, which will be of great benefit.)</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: In recent days, Yangzhou has seen an increasing number of disaster victims transported from various places, resulting in increased tension in the accommodation and relief work. However, in recent days, the water level in the lower reaches of the canal has been decreasing daily. According to the water gauge of the Shaobo Three-Ditch Sluice Gate, compared to before the breach of the dike, it has dropped by more than eleven feet. The magnitude of the water entering the lower river can already be seen. Furthermore, the flow of water in the canal has always been from north to south, but for the past ten days, regardless of whether it is high tide or not, it has been flowing from south to north, and the water is very clear, like the West Lake. The reason for this is unknown. However, it is heard that the Yi River is discharging again, which is causing considerable tension in the Huaiyin area. It is uncertain whether the great disaster will come to an end. It is not easy to completely block the breached areas for the time being. The administrative authorities believe that Jiangsu does not have the talent to block the breaches, and it is planned to recruit from the banks of the Yellow River to avoid unexpected events after the blocking.

<h3 id="e68">Zhang Zhijiang Sends Troops to Prepare for the Opening of the Weirs <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The Dongtai County Party Department and various legal entities telegraphed Superintendent Zhang requesting that troops be sent to open the dikes of the Dafeng Yuhua companies. Superintendent Zhang has prepared to send troops to open them. The telegrams from Zhang are recorded as follows: ▲ Reply to the Telegram from the Dongtai Party Department and Legal Entities (1) Urgent, Dongtai County Party Department and all legal entities: Your telegram has been read. The flood disaster has caused suffering and displacement among the people. I deeply sympathize with the tragic situation. The troops needed to maintain the opening of the weirs have been prepared. I will wait for the provincial government to send personnel to Yangzhou before departing to Dongtai. Reply, Zhang Zhijiang. (Attached below is the incoming telegram) Superintendent Zhang: Your telegram has been respectfully read. All subordinate counties have been submerged, and countless people have drowned. If the dikes of the Dafeng Yuhua companies are delayed in opening, the people will be completely wiped out. We beg you to send troops to Dongtai day and night to save the dying. Tears and pleadings, the county Party Department and all legal entities kowtow. (2) Dongtai County Party Department and all legal entities: The telegram has been read. I have received a telegram from the provincial government requesting that troops be sent to assist in opening the weirs and letting the water into the sea. However, the method is currently being discussed. Once a decision is made, troops will be sent to assist. Reply, Zhang Zhijiang. (Attached below is the incoming telegram) Superintendent Zhang: We have just received the 30th telegram from the provincial government and are delighted to know that you have sent troops to open the Dafeng Yuhua weirs. Millions of disaster victims are about to be submerged. Hearing this, we are dancing with joy and eagerly awaiting your banner to save us from this submergence. We implore you to come quickly. The Dongtai County Party Department and all legal entities kowtow together.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Brigade Commander Shi (1) Yangzhou Commander Shi Wenfu: I have just received the telegram from the provincial government. I am sending Section Chief He Haiqiao of this government, along with Committee Member Xu Ji of the Department of Construction, to Dongtai to discuss the matter with the county magistrate. I have instructed Section Chief He to pay a visit. I hope you will provide assistance. Other than the method, which will be telegraphed after discussion, I am sending this telegram to inform you in advance. Your younger brother, Zhijiang, winter afternoon. (2) Urgent, Commander Shi Wenfu: I have just received a telegram from Chief Commander Liang reporting that the telegram indicated that the salt reclamation company in Dongtai would discharge water into the sea and open the brine weirs, and ordering that troops be dispatched to assist. I have learned that I have ordered the Shi brigade to dispatch two companies of infantry to prepare. However, both locations are blocked by water, and troops must travel by boat. However, the cost of this boat is enormous. How should it be handled? Please telegraph instructions to comply. I also met with the representatives sent by the provincial government, Xu and He, who said that the transportation and all expenses would be borne by the provincial government. After the troops are dispatched, the provincial government will send personnel to Yangzhou to accompany them. However, the strength of two companies seems too weak to maintain the opening of the weirs. In addition to telegraphing Chief Commander Liang to dispatch a full battalion, I hope you will prepare a battalion of infantry. As soon as the personnel and transportation from the provincial government arrive in Yangzhou, they will depart. This government is also sending Councilor Zhang Ruitang to assist and inform. Zhang Zhijiang, winter.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Chief Commander Liang (Urgent), Qingjiang Chief Commander Liang Zichao: Confidential. Dong telegram reported that Brigade Shi's troops will dispatch two companies to Dongtai to maintain the opening of the weirs and discharge water into the sea. I have just learned that Section Chiefs He and Xu from the provincial government have come to this office to discuss the dispatch procedures and bear all transportation costs. However, the strength of two companies seems too weak to maintain the opening of the weirs and may be negligent. In addition to telegraphing Brigade Commander Shi to prepare a battalion of troops for dispatch, I hope you will also inform them and send an experienced person to assist.

<p>Provincial Relief Association Divides Flood Severity into Four Levels</p>
<p>More Than 9.48 Million Disaster Victims Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: This year's flood in Anhui Province has been classified as the second most severe by the central government. Hong Hui, a disaster investigation commissioner of the Relief Committee, and Yan Zhuang, a relief commissioner of the Executive Yuan, have arrived in Anhui to investigate the disaster. Hong went to Dongliu, Qiupu, and other counties to investigate and returned to the province yesterday. He then took a small steamship to Guichi for investigation. Yan will go to Jiangxi in the coming days to discuss relief matters, leaving his attendant Sun Weidong in Anhui to handle matters. In addition, Tian Jiongjin, a commissioner of the Control Yuan, led his attendant Zhuo Hengzhi to Anhui on the Jiangxin ship at 6:00 AM on the 6th. He will go to the disaster areas for inspection in the coming days. The Anhui Provincial Relief Association was established on the 2nd of this month. The association, based on the approximate situation reported by the counties and with reference to the water situation of the Yangtze River, Huai River, lakes, and the composition of land and weirs, divided the counties with 60% to 80% damage into the first-class disaster area, 40% to 60% into the second-class disaster area, 30% to 40% into the third-class disaster area, and 20% to 30% into the fourth or fifth-class disaster area. There are a total of sixteen first-class disaster counties: Huaining, Tongcheng, Wangjiang, Wuwei, Hexian, Xuancheng, Guichi, Dongliu, Tongling, Wuhu, Fengyang, Shouxian, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Huoqiu, and Wuhe. There are twelve second-class disaster counties: Susong, Hanshan, Dangtu, Fanchang, Suxian, Fuyang, Mengcheng, Guoyang, Yingshang, Sixian, Xuyi, and Tianchang. There are eight third-class disaster counties: Qianshan, Taihu, Hefei, Chaoxian, Lujiang, Qiupu, Lingbi, and Quanjiao. There are nine fourth-class disaster counties: Shucheng, Luan, Huoshan, Nanling, Dingyuan, Taihe, Haoxian, Chuxian, and Laian. There are three fifth-class disaster counties: Qingyang, Guangde, and Langxi. The total disaster area in the province is 1,803,400 li. The total number of disaster victims in the province is 9,485,000. The disaster area accounts for 37% of the total area of the province, and the disaster victims account for 44% of the total population of the province. After consulting with Yan and others, the distribution can be considered. (September 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">General Situation of the Disaster in Various Counties of Henan Province <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sishui Recently, the Provincial Relief Association received a report from the relief branch in the county, stating that the land in Sishui is barren, and in years of good harvest, most of the food is supplied by neighboring counties. Once there is a poor harvest, they escape to beg for food. This year, there was a severe drought in the spring, and only 20% of the wheat was harvested. In the summer, there was continuous rain, and most of the autumn crops were not planted. Suddenly, in early August, torrential rain fell, which continued for many days. The autumn crops and houses on both sides of the Si River were submerged and collapsed, countless. The cities and towns nearby were engulfed by the whirlpool of the Yellow River, and the loss of material was countless. They were originally the survivors of soldiers and bandits, and nine out of ten families were empty. Now they have suffered such a terrible disaster. How can the people of Sishui survive? They can only weep and ask for relief to save the disaster victims. The Provincial Relief Association has reported the situation to the central government and appealed for relief.</p>
<p>▲ Yiyang The county Party Department telegraphed, stating that the land in Yiyang County is inherently poor. In recent years, locusts have bred, and there have been military disasters. The local vitality has been completely damaged. Moreover, bandit gangs are rampant, ravaging the entire territory. The people are in a situation where they have no way to escape. Since the summer, there have been continuous heavy rains, like pouring. The Dao Hai and Luo rivers collapsed at the same time. The houses in dozens of villages along the river, such as Lian Zhuang Li Qu, Sun Liu Hancheng, Liuquan, and Shuitan, became a bubble. Livestock was lost. Although the number of people who died in the water has not been clearly investigated, it is estimated that it is no less than hundreds. The Relief Association has sent commissioners to carry money to distribute emergency relief and has telegraphed all parties to appeal widely.</p>
<p>▲ Tanghe The county has fallen twice this year. The Cui and Wei bandits are inhuman. White bones are like mountains, filling the city and fields. The dead are gone, and the living are displaced. Everywhere is desolate. In June, July, and August, there was continuous rain. The Tang, Tong, and Bi rivers broke out at the same time, overflowing and flooding, accounting for 60% to 70% of the county. The depth of the water is about five feet above the ground. After the bandit atmosphere, there was a terrible disaster. The number of houses in the county that were destroyed and burned is countless. The Tang people have no hope. Although the Provincial Relief Association allocated 9,000 yuan for emergency relief, it is a drop in the bucket. Therefore, the county is now hoping that all parties will provide emergency relief quickly.</p>
<p>▲ Gongxian A flood occurred in the county, and all the houses in the city were submerged. The towns of Heishiguan, Sucun, and Xiaoyi were more than ten feet deep in water. According to the investigation report of the relief association, the general situation of the losses is as follows: (1) Number of affected villages: 120; (2) Affected square li: more than 630; (3) Submerged land: 160,000 mu; washed away land: 190,000 mu; (4) Number of affected households: more than 18,000 households, totaling 170,000 people; (5) Number of deaths: more than 90; (6) Number of livestock deaths: more than 120; (7) Number of houses collapsed: more than 50,000; (8) Loss of grain and property: more than 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Weishi Recently, the county relief branch reported to the Provincial Relief Association that the subordinate county is located on the south bank of the Yellow River. During the Qing Dynasty, the river breached its banks, and the entire territory became a sandbar. Wheat cannot be grown, and they rely on autumn crops for their livelihood. Last year, the county was沦入a war zone, with horizontal and vertical trenches. Because the people are unable to fill them, since summer, there has been continuous rain, lasting for days. The new and old Mai Lu rivers and the Shuangbi River successively collapsed, resulting in water depths of six to seven feet on the ground. The autumn crops were lost to the waves, and many houses became bubbles. The number of people and livestock who were drowned, crushed, and injured is uncountable. A vast expanse of water has become a marsh. The cries of desolation are heard throughout the fields. They are waiting for a way to provide relief. The Relief Association has sent telegrams to all parties to request relief and has sent commissioners to investigate.</p>

<p>Now, we will translate and record the publicly available content from the first section of the document:</p>
<p>(1) Outline of the Election Movement for Chinese Peasants, Workers, and Soldiers to Participate in the First National Soviet Congress (Excerpt from the Pamphlet "Outline of the Election Movement for Chinese Peasants, Workers, and Soldiers to Participate in the First National Soviet Congress")</p>
<p>The Central Preparatory Committee of the National Soviet Congress of Delegates of Peasants, Workers, and Soldiers has promulgated the regulations for electing delegates to the congress in Soviet and reactionary areas and has notified the preparatory committees and public organizations to intensify the election movement according to these instructions. The National Congress has been postponed to February 7, 1931. However, given the improper preparations by the preparatory committees in various regions, the Central Preparatory Committee has had to urge these committees and public organizations to intensify the election movement and to announce the following election outline so that the election movement in various regions can be consistent with the instructions of the Central Committee and the National Congress can be successful. (1) The Significance of the First National Soviet Congress of Delegates and its Election Movement: The convening of the First National Congress of Delegates of Chinese Peasants, Workers, and Soldiers is occurring when the Chinese Soviet revolutionary movement, under the leadership of the proletariat, is fiercely attacking the reactionary politics of the imperialist Kuomintang, and also when the imperialist powers and the Kuomintang warlords</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>are jointly attacking the Soviet regime. The purpose of the Congress is to unify and consolidate the power of the Soviets throughout the country and to establish the highest power of the peasants, workers, and soldiers under the dictatorship of the Soviet central government. Therefore, all preparatory committees and revolutionary organizations should closely organize the mass election movement. (2) The Nature and Tasks of the Election Movement: The National Soviet Congress election movement held in the current period of class struggle aims to carry out class organization and establish the power of the working masses. (3) The Class Perspective of the Election Movement: The election movement should be carried out among the working masses, and the leadership of the proletariat should be fully guaranteed in this movement. Landlord oppressors, factory and shop owners who exploit with usury, rich peasants, and all reactionary elements should be deprived of their right to vote so that they cannot participate in Soviet organs and undermine the dictatorship of the peasants and workers. (4) On the Propaganda Work of the Election Movement: Propaganda work should be carried out by systematic and responsible individuals. Propaganda work includes the distribution of propaganda materials, the organization of speaking teams, the establishment of reading groups and civilian schools, and the establishment of communication organs. Red labor unions should find ways to conduct propaganda among factory workers and shop employees, organize a propaganda department in each factory or shop, and inform them of the political power and good living conditions enjoyed by workers in the Soviet areas. Rural red organizations should incite peasants to refuse to pay taxes and rents and refuse to repay debts. Intensive propaganda should be carried out among soldiers to make them understand the good treatment received by soldiers in the Soviet areas and encourage them to desert their posts and join the Red Army with their weapons. (5) The Election Movement and Mass Struggle: The purpose of the election movement should be to transform the economic struggles of the masses into political struggles, paying particular attention to sailors, soldiers, factory workers, and railway workers. (6) Mass Organizations in the Election Movement: 1. Absorb the masses into red organizations; 2. Develop and expand the organization of red peasants in non-Soviet areas; 3. Organize soldiers' committees in the army; 4. Consolidate the organizations of the poor peasant associations, revolutionary mutual aid societies, anti-imperialist leagues, and revolutionary student federations. (7) The Method of Election: Each organization should hold separate meetings to elect representatives to participate in the election movement. Electors should be warned to carefully elect qualified individuals as representatives. (8) Preparation for the General Election Congress: A preparatory committee should be organized to handle the preparations for the general election congress. When the general election congress is held, security guards and children's corps should be dispatched to maintain order. (5) The Work of Delegates Participating in the First Election: The delegate should undertake the following tasks: 1. Engage in activities in factories, rural areas, and barracks; 2. Recruit members for red labor unions; 3. Promote the National Soviet Congress of Delegates; 4. Raise funds for the election movement. (10) The Work of the National Congress after the Final Election: After the final election is completed, the National Congress should convene newly elected delegates to familiarize them with the details of Soviet duties. The above outline must be strictly observed and implemented by all election movement preparatory committees.</p>
<p>(8) Report from the Eastern Hubei Special Committee on the Defeat of the Red Army</p>
<p>The number of enemy troops in Yangxin is four regiments, in Daye two regiments, in Tongshan one regiment, and in Wuning two regiments. Thus, our situation is becoming increasingly difficult. The enemy troops in Yangxin are now actively attacking us, and we can only defend three strategic points, the rest have been seized by the enemy. They have also organized local militias everywhere, which are also a considerable force. People from various places have been fleeing back to our side one after another in recent days, making it particularly difficult to provide supplies. Other areas, such as Daye and Wuning, are also seeing daily reductions, which is extremely serious. The advance of our Red Army's Third Army is too slow. All the firearms are only enough for nine hundred men. Previously, we sent a battalion to Xiushui to contact the 16th Army, so the current number is only two battalions. Coupled with the lack of bullets and the ineffectiveness of lower-level cadres, we have suffered more than one setback. Our work in the white areas has also been fruitless. However, at this critical moment, we are unwilling to sit and wait for death, so we have decided to send a portion of our forces and the people to fight the enemy, while the remaining forces will be used for rear-area defense. When the battalion sent to Xiushui is recalled, we will unite the armed masses and fight the enemy to the death. The enemy troops have now retreated into the city and dare not station in the countryside, fearing losses. Although we do not have sophisticated equipment, our combat performance in the white areas is considerable. It is a pity that our organizational work cannot keep pace with the military, so we are actively developing party work in the white areas, organizing the masses, and creating economic and political struggles to match the military. In the red areas, we will pay more attention to equipping the people with weapons and finding ways to expand our propaganda among the enemy troops. (The enemy soldiers who are subjected to our propaganda mostly fire into the air and do not aim at the people; however, the organization of the army is not yet perfect, so there have been no large-scale defections so far.) The general public has a good attitude towards us. The people of the areas that were once Soviet areas but have been seized by the enemy can all recall the benefits of the Soviet government. Therefore, our work in the white areas is still easy to do, but they have not received news from various places north of the Yangtze River for a long time. Although the organizations in these places still exist, the Soviet government has been completely eliminated. Eastern Hubei Special Committee, May 12. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Shandong Provincial Government to Purchase Books from the Haiyuan Pavilion <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Agreed on a Half-Donation, Half-Sale Arrangement</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Library is in contact with the Yang family of Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng, Shandong, to arrange a half-donation, half-sale arrangement to allow the Shandong Provincial Government to preserve the collection. This matter has been brewing for many years, with ups and downs and much effort. Preliminary agreement was reached last month, but the Shibu incident occurred, and military affairs became urgent, so the matter was shelved again. Now that the situation has stabilized, the old case has been brought up again, and the two sides have largely reached an agreement. According to Wang Fangting, Director of the Department of Industry, Chairman Han has recently agreed to the case of purchasing the books from Haiyuan Pavilion for preservation by the provincial government. After some further procedures, a decision can be made. He suggests that the funds for purchasing the books could be advanced by the provincial government first. After the books are transported, a contract could be signed with the Commercial Press to print and sell them, and pre-sale vouchers could be issued. The books are all well-known and rare, and would not be difficult to sell. The book funds of three to five hundred thousand yuan could then be returned to the provincial treasury. In this way, the Yang family would receive the funds, Shandong would preserve the ancient books, and they would be widely circulated throughout the country, achieving several benefits in one stroke. Wang Xiantang, the director of the library, is currently visiting libraries in various places, and a plan can be studied when he returns to Jinan. According to reports, the Nanjing Library initially argued that the books from Haiyuan Pavilion should be kept in the central location, while the Peiping Library argued that they should be kept in the old capital, the cultural center. Each side held its own reasons, leading to a long period of unresolved issues. Finally, it was decided that they would be kept in Shandong, but the issue of the book price repeatedly caused complications. During this period, Lao Zhichang, the former Minister of Communications, because of his relationship with the book owner Yang Jingfu as father-in-law and son-in-law, made considerable efforts. Finally, a half-donation, half-sale arrangement was agreed upon, with the Song Dynasty editions of the Four Books and Five Classics remaining with the Yang family, and the remaining books being transferred. In the future, well-known figures and appraisers will be invited to publicly evaluate them, and the Shandong Provincial Government will pay half the value (approximately 300,000 yuan). A Haiyuan Pavilion will be built in the library to preserve the books and commemorate Yang's contribution in donating the books. All parties have agreed on this matter, and there should be no other changes. A decision on the implementation plan can be made when Han Fuju and Wang Xiantang return to Jinan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Results of Investigation into the Fujian Paper Bamboo Shoot Tax Case <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Lin Dingxun and Zheng Jinqing Transferred to the Court for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Zhedan Received a Major Demerit for Ineffective Handling of Affairs</p>
<p>The Provincial Party Headquarters Still Requests the Central Government to Investigate He Gonggan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Department of Finance discovered the details of the paper bamboo shoot business tax fraud case, which has been reported previously. It is now learned that the Department of Education Director Cheng Shigui and the Department of Finance Director He Gonggan, who were dispatched by the provincial government to investigate the case, found six major suspicious points: (1) Lin Dingxun, the director of the Paper Bamboo Shoot Business Tax Bureau, previously admitted to the Department of Finance that he had partners, but now he is reversing himself, contradicting himself. If there were no illegal shareholders involved, why would he try so hard to conceal it? (2) Lin Dingxun started collecting taxes in June, but the contract document stated that it started on July 1st, and he concealed the tax revenue for June and did not report it, which is suspected of embezzlement of public funds. (3) A search of Lin Dingxun's residence found more than 200 letters from before 1919, but none of the letters from this year were found, which is suspected of destroying evidence. (4) The account books for the paper bamboo shoot tax declaration and the account books of the Paper Bamboo Shoot Tax Bureau have already been submitted to the Department of Finance for review, but the tax receipts that should be submitted for inspection were repeatedly urged before they were submitted, and the ink on the seam was smudged, which is suspected of tampering. (5) Zheng Jinqing, the specialist for paper bamboo shoot tax, has been handling tax affairs for many years and is very familiar with the situation. However, he arbitrarily lowered the tax amount that has always been collected for more than 200,000 yuan, entrusting Lin Dingxun to handle it for 150,000 yuan, and even after repeated reports, he still sided with him. At first, he wrongly judged that the amount could not be increased, and then he did not only not criticize but also deemed appropriate and forwarded to the record Lin Dingxun's report of the peak season as off-season and the concealment of the June tax revenue, which shows that he colluded with Lin Dingxun to embezzle tax revenue, which is a major suspicion. (6) Zhang Zhedan, the acting director of the Business Tax Bureau, has experience in consumption tax affairs. However, after the clerk Su Wenbing revealed the corruption, he did not conduct a detailed audit or make a clear statement, which is not free from the appearance of skillfully avoiding responsibility. The details of the investigation have now been reported to the provincial government for decision. The provincial government committee decided the previous day that Lin Dingxun and Zheng Jinqing are indeed suspected of major corruption and should be transferred to the court for investigation and handling according to law. Zhang Zhedan should receive a major demerit for ineffective handling of affairs. Su Wenbing is diligent and commendable and should be promoted to show reward and encouragement. The business tax should be seriously reorganized by the Department of Finance, and the situation should be reported in detail for review and handling. However, the Provincial Party Headquarters believes that He Gonggan, the director of the Department of Finance, is suspected of communicating with Zhang Zhedan, Zheng Jinqing, and Lin Dingxun to jointly commit corruption, embezzle large sums of money, and destroy evidence. At the previous standing committee meeting, it was argued that since He Gonggan is the main person in this case, it is inappropriate for the provincial government to appoint him as the special investigator. It was decided to send a telegram to the central government and request the National Government to first suspend He Gonggan from his post and then send a special investigator to Fujian to investigate the case. Yesterday, another telegram was sent to the central government, requesting that He be dismissed from his post and investigated. (September 4)</p>

<p>▲After the major flood in Wuhu, it was followed by a strong wind, and thousands of disaster victims were swept into the water by huge waves and drowned. Clean corpses are floating everywhere, and the various charitable organizations are unable to recover them all. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs specifically telegraphed the county government to quickly find ways to hire boats for recovery and burial to prevent epidemics.</p>
<p>▲Since Anhui rice was banned from being transported out of the province, although the prevention and control efforts in various counties have been strict, there are still many who smuggle it out of the country. There are more paddy fields in the Sanhe and Shucheng areas under the jurisdiction of Hefei in central Anhui, and it is estimated that more than 100,000 shi of surplus rice can be transported out. A few days ago, a rice merchant surnamed Wang from Hefei purchased several thousand shi of rice in the Sanhe area, using fourteen large civilian boats towed by two small steamers. However, when they reached Yuxikou, they were discovered and detained by the joint defense and self-defense corps of the three counties of He, Hanshan, and Wuwei. Wang and others have now come to Wuhu to find ways to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>▲The Anhui Provincial Government convened a provincial-level disaster relief conference to discuss the relief and reconstruction plans for the disaster areas throughout the province. Zhai Zhancheng, the representative of the Wuhu Flood Relief Association, and Wu Xingzhou, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, were summoned to the province yesterday to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>▲According to the audit of the Wuhu Flood Relief Association, the current emergency relief and future spring relief will require no less than 1.5 million yuan. Ways to raise funds are currently being coordinated, but there is a concern that the recent emergency relief will not be able to meet the immediate needs. A telegram was sent to the provincial government again today, requesting approval to designate Wuhu as a special disaster area and to allocate a large sum of money first for relief.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, the Wuhu County Government captured five bandits, including Wang Yongzhen, who were intercepting travelers in Yitaiwei. They were executed by shooting at the railway embankment today. (6th)</p>

<p>Continuous Kidnappings Occur in Guangfu Township. Bandit Activity is Rampant in Various Townships Along Taihu Lake. Kidnapping cases are heard of every day. The authorities have no way to suppress them. On the night of the 7th, at about 10:00 p.m., more than 20 bandits suddenly came to No. 2 Chongshan Temple Front Street, Guangfu Township, Taihu Lake, and kidnapped the homeowner, Gu Kaishe, and his son, Yaoming. Then, they went to Dongbang and kidnapped a person named Sun Honggao, heading towards South Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance Corrects Official Land Mistaken as Public Property. Wu Kunjian from the Official Property Bureau submitted a report to the Department of Finance stating that the ownerless official land in Wu County had been mistakenly classified as public property and requesting correction. Subsequently, the Department of Finance instructed that since there is a register of public property in Wu County, it should naturally be used as the basis. If it is not listed in the register, how can the transfer by the Finance Bureau be used as a basis for public ownership, thereby encroaching on official land? The Wu County Government should be instructed to quickly make corrections based on the register to emphasize the importance of official property. The bureau then forwarded a letter to the county government, scheduling a meeting of relevant agencies to follow the department's instructions and implement the division based on the original register to clarify the boundaries.</p>

<p>Water Police Detectives Capture Notorious Robbers. Xiong Bin, a patrol officer from the 2nd District Department of the Provincial Public Security Force stationed in Wuxi Water, along with Detective Zhou and others, captured three robbers, Tang Jinbao, Wang Maolang, and Chen Baolang, a few days ago in Yangming Road. They were interrogated in the district and confessed to several accomplices. Yesterday, Detective Zhou Rugang, along with detective Chen Xiang and others, went to Zhaotian, a remote mountain area in Hudai, and captured three more bandits, Wang Shenglin, his younger brother Wang Xigen, and a helper, Chen Tingyuan. They were immediately interrogated and confessed to the robbery cases in Qingshanwan and Shuiding Lane. They are being detained pending review. The robber Wang Shenglin is strong and proficient in martial arts. He was a member of the guard team under Mao Xueqin, a Red bandit in Jiangyin. He is also responsible for the cases of shooting and killing Chen Guankui and Luo Shixiong in Shanzhen Bridge, as well as using the party to intimidate and defraud the families of Wang Zengfu and Zhou Guozhen in Xiwujie Bridge. It is said that the Jiangyin County Government had previously issued an arrest warrant for him.</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Mu of Dike Refugees Temporarily Stay in Zhangzhu. According to news from the navigation sector yesterday, this year in Yixing, there has been continuous rain and rising floodwaters, submerging low-lying fields. Ten thousand mu of dikes and nearby farmlands have been completely submerged. There will be no harvest this autumn, and the grass huts where the villagers live have been washed away, leaving them with nowhere to live. Therefore, they have had to leave their homes, supporting the old and carrying the young, seeking refuge in the Chenghuang Temple in Zhangzhu Town, with a total of more than 200 men and women. They are covered in dirt and are quite pitiful. Merchants in the town are providing food, which is proving difficult to sustain.</p>

<p>Fundraising for Disaster Relief Compilation. Wu Yi gentry Zhuang Kuan, Feng Jiaxi, Dian Ken, and others have launched a fundraising event to sell tickets for ancient and modern celebrity calligraphy and paintings to raise funds for disaster relief, as the disaster situation in various provinces is extremely serious. They have collected about two or three hundred pieces of ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings. They have been publicly exhibiting them since the 8th and are selling tickets at any time. The proceeds from the tickets will be sent to the disaster areas for relief. In addition, the Xicheng Chamber of Commerce Branch, the Fire Brigade, the Taiping Town Office, and others will perform plays to help with disaster relief at the Xiqu Grand Theater on the 7th, 8th, and 9th. Various theaters, such as Binhe, will also perform plays by amateur actors on the 16th, 17th, and 18th to raise funds. The Chamber of Commerce has received donations for several days in a row, totaling approximately 10,000 yuan, which has been successively sent to the Disaster Relief Association for relief.</p>
<p>More Than 60,000 Yuan Short in Educational Expenses. Wu Yi's educational expenses are more than 60,000 yuan short. After submitting a budget that was planned to be prepared at 90%, we received instructions yesterday stating that the shortage amounts to 64,000 yuan. The non-urgent tasks and the excessive spending of various agencies should be drastically reduced to make it suitable. The proposed 90% budget preparation method is inappropriate.</p>

<p>Notorious Bandit in Jiangbei Arrested and Escorted to the Province. The notorious bandit Chou Hengzhong in Jiangbei has been gathering crowds for years, ravaging counties such as Tonghai, Rutai, and Jingjiang, committing numerous crimes. Recently, the bandit was captured in Taixing under the alias Wang Yizhi. He confessed to committing crimes in various counties and has been escorted to the Provincial Government's Provisional Military Tribunal for interrogation and handling.

Police officers also extorted 1 yuan every month. If they did not pay, they were threatened. Now, the Guojie Village Committee has filed a complaint with the county. After the county sent a commissioner to verify the facts, it ordered the Public Security Bureau Chief Gao to dismiss the patrol chief and send him to the court for investigation.

<p>The Shaoxing-Caoe Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will be connected first. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, from Hangzhou to Ningbo, had its Caoe River railway bridge construction delayed due to the sudden outbreak of the European War sixteen years ago, which led to the German engineers returning to their country, causing inconvenience to passengers. The Ministry of Railways, noting the high number of passengers and busy transportation in Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Hangzhou, plans to use the Italian Boxer Indemnity to complete the route. The Shaoxing-Caoe section will be built first to facilitate transportation. Yesterday, a telegram was sent instructing the chief engineer, an Englishman named Desford, to work with Engineer Pu to plan everything.</p>

<p>Losses from the Floods in the Southwest. Since the hurricane and torrential rain on the nights of the 24th and 25th of last month, countless lives have been lost and property losses have exceeded one million. The following is a record of the news received daily from various sources: (1) Outside the Yuansha Mound embankment, about five miles from Baiguan, was breached by the tidal bore. Seventeen households of residents, except for three who escaped, were all buried in the bellies of fish. (2) Along the coast of Lihai, the residents' huts and firewood sheds were washed away by the water. The cotton in the sandy land was almost entirely broken by the wind. (3) At the Yuya Eight-Community Embankment, more than five miles from Zhangzhen, the Shun River's seventy-two tributary streams surged due to the flood from Sheng, causing five breaches, with the Chi Lake Dam being the most severe, stretching over four hundred feet. The water was over ten feet high on the flat ground, and over five hundred thousand acres of crops within the affected area were completely destroyed. The Wantou and Nanpu embankments, about five miles from the town, though not collapsed, suffered significant damage with fields and crops submerged. The Oupu Embankment, about ten miles from the town, is an important defense line for Wantou, Nanpu, and other hillside areas. The embankment site is over ten feet wide and over two feet high, and the construction was not weak. However, the land is entirely sandy, and the mountain torrents from the Du Zhai Ridge suddenly erupted, catching the residents off guard and causing a collapse with a breach of over one hundred feet. The deaths of people and livestock and the submersion of fields and crops are countless. It is estimated that over eighty villages and settlements throughout the town are affected, with the disaster area accounting for eight tenths of the total.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Opinions on Compiling University Curriculum <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhongfan</p>
<p>The compilation of university curriculum should have a certain objective and a consistent plan, so as to avoid being fragmented and lacking a system. Looking at the recent universities' implementation of the elective course system, apart from stipulating that Chinese, English, and Mathematics are compulsory courses for the first year, the rest are up to the students to choose by department. Thus, they choose what interests them most, seeking only specialization, regardless of order. Overreaching and aiming too high is the nature of youth, and there is nothing strange about it. However, the negative consequences are that students often lack general knowledge and have a weak foundation. Even if they proceed to study specialized topics and expert theories, they only scratch the surface and gain nothing of substance. For schools, opening too many courses cannot be handled by three or five full-time teachers, requiring the hiring of many part-time lecturers, wasting funds. For teachers, the scope of courses they teach is too narrow, and the teaching materials are scarce, forcing them to patch things up and muddle through. To correct these ills, I propose to reorganize the university curriculum as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Curriculum</p>
<p>University curriculum is divided into four categories: 1. Compulsory Public Courses, 2. Elective Public Courses, 3. Compulsory Major Courses, 4. Elective Minor Courses. The first two years are for completing categories one and two, and the last two years are for studying categories three and four.</p>
<p>(1) Compulsory Public Courses</p>
<p>1. Party Ideology: This course lectures on the Three Principles of the People, the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Outline of National Reconstruction, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theories. Two hours of instruction per week, completed in one year, for a total of four credits.</p>
<p>2. Basic Chinese: This course focuses on prose, supplemented by poetry and lyrics, emphasizing practice, and requiring extracurricular reading of famous authors' collections. Three hours of instruction and one hour of practice per week, completed in one year, for a total of six credits.</p>
<p>3. Basic English: This course, in addition to lecturing, emphasizes practice, extracurricular reading of books and newspapers, and holding speeches and debates. Three hours of instruction and one hour of practice per week, completed in one year, for a total of six credits.</p>
<p>4. Second Foreign Language: Choose one of French, German, or Japanese. Students of literature may choose to study Latin. Three hours per week, completed in one year, for a total of six credits.</p>
<p>5. Military Training: According to the plans of the Directorate General of Military Training, completed in two years, for a total of six credits.</p>
<p>6. Physical Education and Hygiene: Universities should set up several specialists in physical education and hygiene guidance, who will lecture on physical education and hygiene theories, supervise and encourage students to participate in various sports, form hygienic habits, and correct bad habits. Completed in four years, without credit.</p>
<p>The above compulsory public courses total twenty-eight credits.</p>
<p>(2) Elective Public Courses, divided into five groups:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>1. Methodology of Science: 3 credits</p>
<p>2. History of Scientific Development: 3 credits</p>
<p>3. Physics: 6 credits</p>
<p>4. Chemistry: 6 credits</p>
<p>5. Biology: 6 credits</p>
<p>The purpose of this group of courses is to enable students to use scientific methods, understand the general situation and laws of the natural world, and train their clear minds and meticulous thinking. Select twelve credits.</p>
<p>Second Group</p>
<p>1. Modern Chinese History (Last Hundred Years): 3 credits</p>
<p>2. History of Western Culture: 3 credits</p>
<p>3. Overview of Modern Civilization: 3 credits</p>
<p>4. Current Status of International Politics and Economics: 3 credits</p>
<p>5. Current Status of Chinese Politics and Economics: 3 credits</p>
<p>6. Social Structure and Its Evolution: 3 credits</p>
<p>The purpose of this group of courses is to enable students to understand the era in which they live and the cultural status of their society and country, and their interrelationships. Select twelve credits.</p>
<p>Third Group</p>
<p>1. History of Chinese Philosophy: 6 credits</p>
<p>2. History of Western Philosophy: 6 credits</p>
<p>3. Philosophy of Life: 3 credits</p>
<p>4. Logic: 3 credits</p>
<p>The purpose of these courses is to enable students to synthesize knowledge from various subjects and further seek the overall universal principles and the meaning of life. Select twelve credits.</p>
<p>Fourth Group</p>
<p>1. Chinese Literature: 6 credits</p>
<p>2. Western Literature: 6 credits</p>
<p>3. Introduction to Art: 3 credits</p>
<p>4. History of Western Art: 3 credits</p>
<p>The purpose of this group of courses is to enable students to understand literary trends and their interests, thereby cultivating noble personalities. Select twelve credits.</p>
<p>Fifth Group</p>
<p>1. Applied Chemistry: 6 credits</p>
<p>2. Handicrafts: 6 credits</p>
<p>3. Horticulture: 6 credits</p>
<p>4. Animal Husbandry: 6 credits</p>
<p>The purpose of this group of courses is to enable students to acquire a specialized skill that can be applied in practice. Female students may substitute with domestic science, cooking, and sewing. Select six credits.</p>
<p>The above five groups, totaling fifty-four credits, are completed in the first and second years.</p>
<p>3. Compulsory Major Courses: Approximately 30 to 50 credits</p>
<p>4. Elective Minor Courses: Approximately 20 credits</p>
<p>(2) Credit Allocation</p>
<p>First and Second Semesters: Approximately 20 to 22 credits, totaling 40-44</p>
<p>Third and Fourth Semesters: Same as above, 40-44</p>
<p>Fifth and Sixth Semesters: Approximately 15 to 20 credits, 30-40</p>
<p>Seventh and Eighth Semesters: Approximately 10 to 15 credits, 20-30</p>
<p>Total: Approximately 130 to 150 credits, 130-150</p>
<p>(3) Examinations</p>
<p>After completing the compulsory and elective public courses in the first and second years, in addition to the temporary examinations by the teachers in charge, the examination committee will conduct a selective joint examination. Those who pass will be given a diploma for the preliminary stage of university and will be allowed to enter the various colleges to receive departmental education and study the major and minor programs.</p>
<p>(4) Expenses</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in the first and second years, only the Colleges of Arts and Sciences need to open public compulsory and elective courses for students to choose from. Other colleges do not need to open separate courses, and the expenses for the first and second years can be entirely transferred for equipment and research. Compared with the current system, the expenses will definitely be reduced.</p>
<p>(5) Equipment</p>
<p>Currently, universities, except for natural sciences which are supplemented by experiments, rarely emphasize practical surveys and tests in other social sciences. As for literature, art, philosophy, and other subjects, there are no opportunities for discussion and exercises other than classroom lectures. In the future, research rooms for various subjects should be added, displaying various reference materials for students to browse independently, and specifying discussion times for teachers and students to exchange ideas.</p>
<p>(6) Advisors</p>
<p>Currently, some university teachers hold courses at two or three schools concurrently, rushing around all day, with students having very little opportunity to interact, let alone learn from each other. In the future, we should find ways to increase salaries, restrict concurrent classes, and have full-time teachers serve as advisors, guiding students in the research room at specified times each week for practical research.</p>
<p>The above is a rough statement of my personal opinions, hoping that people in the country will provide corrections.</p>

<p>Result: 24 to 28, Hsi Ching Wins</p>
<p>See you again tomorrow night at 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Chih Chih, which is famous in the south of the Yangtze River, and Hsi Ching team, which is highly regarded in Shanghai, played a disaster relief basketball game at the Chinese Basketball Hall last night at 7:30 PM. People from all walks of life enthusiastically participated, numbering nearly a thousand, with excellent results. Chih Chih had a strong momentum throughout the game, consistently taking the lead. Unexpectedly, in the last three minutes, they suddenly showed a scattered phenomenon, resulting in a four-point difference and falling behind. The result was 24 to 28. The two teams will meet again tomorrow night at 7:30 PM, and there will be another bloody battle to determine the outcome.</p>

<p>Those who appreciate basketball skills are certainly unwilling to miss this good opportunity, and the income is entirely for disaster relief purposes. Considering both public and private interests, spending six jiao is a good deal. There were 644 tickets sold, and the tickets sold by Chih Chih and Hsi Ching have not yet been received. The total is estimated to be about a thousand, with donations near 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Focus of Victory or Defeat <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Victory or defeat is commonplace for soldiers, and there is no need to dwell on it, but it is necessary to seek the focus of victory or defeat in order to improve strategies and achieve all-round talent. The athletes of Chih Chih are undoubtedly agile and skilled in basketball. However, their inaccurate long shots, excessive fouls, and too few follow-up shots unfortunately led to their defeat to Hsi Ching. The formation of Hsi Ching is not as neat as that of Chih Chih, but it is more stable. Their victory lies in fewer fouls and more free throws. Hsi Ching scored eight points from free throws and committed four fouls, while Chih Chih scored two points from free throws and committed eleven fouls. Hsi Ching scored six more points. In terms of the number of goals scored, Chih Chih scored eleven goals (22 points) and Hsi Ching scored ten goals (20 points). Chih Chih scored one more goal. In comparison, Chih Chih had the ability to win.</p>

<p>The tense combat between the two sides was exhilarating. Pi Sheng scored a free throw, breaking the silence in the basketball hall. Gu Guangdao and Kong Guangyi followed suit, putting Chih Chih in the lead. Shi Kuiya and Shi Misi worked hard, creating a 4-4 tie. Chih Chih first, Hsi Ching later. After 4-4, there were continuous 6-6 and 8-8 ties. Qian Dingshen relied on his clever figure to play with the giant Nepolo as if he were in the palm of his hand. At halftime, Chih Chih led 15 to 14, gaining one more point. In the second half, Shi Kuiya was transferred to the forward position, and Ta Fula replaced him. In the situation between the two sides, Chih Chih still maintained the leading position. Yang Lin Yu and Qian Dingshen attacked the enemy's fortresses once, with a score of 22 to 18. Hsi Ching stepped up their work, and soon it became a 22 tie. At that time, there were three minutes of silence, with no records. Chih Chih's vigor suddenly fell, losing three consecutive goals. At the end, Qian Dingshen scored only one goal, resulting in a 24 to 28 defeat.</p>

<p>Welcoming Chinese Male Players to Compete with Her</p>
<p>Mrs. Ma Di of the United States, who has won the world women's tennis championship for five consecutive years, has now decided to depart for the East after the end of the tennis season this month. She will pass through Honolulu and Japan, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-October. Knowing that it will be difficult to find an opponent in the East, the lady recently made a statement saying that she is willing to compete with male players from China and Japan. According to the lady's skills, she is no less capable than men. Years ago, two Japanese Davis Cup players, Abe and Uba, went to the United States and were defeated by the lady. The Japanese Tennis Association plans to have Abe and Uba compete again when the lady arrives, hoping to avenge their previous humiliation. Although we have Lin Qiu in Shanghai, he may not be able to match the lady's peak.</p>

<h3 id="e106">National Government Relief Committee Holds First General Meeting Today <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Finance Group to Announce Collection of Donations</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Expresses Opinions on Guiding the Huai River</p>
<p>Japanese Circles to Donate 400,000 in Relief Funds</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters, convened the second standing committee meeting of various committee members at 5:30 PM the night before last. Last night at 5:00 PM, he convened the committee members again for discussions. It was decided to hold a general meeting of all committee members at the Central Bank at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss plans for relieving flood disasters in various regions and allocating donations. At the same time, the committee's finance group and disaster area work group announced the second batch of donations received by the group yesterday, along with Mr. Zhu Qinglan's opinions on guiding the Huai River. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Finance Group Continues to Receive Donations The finance group of the committee announced yesterday the amount of the second batch of donations received as follows: 300,000 yuan from Chinese and foreign personnel of the national customs, 80,000 yuan from all members of the Money Trade Association, 60,000 yuan each from the Beijing, Tianjin, and Philippines branches of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters, 30,000 yuan from the Batavia branch, 20,000 yuan from the Chahar branch, 50,000 yuan from the owner of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., 10,000 yuan each from the Four Banks Savings Society, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank, Y盐业 Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and China Industrial Bank, 10,006 yuan from the Philippine Chinese Rice Merchants Association, 7,500 yuan each from British American Tobacco Company, 5,000 yuan from Zhongxing, 4,000 yuan from Jiangsu Bank, 3,000 yuan from Tung Hwa Trust Company, 10,000 yuan from Mr. Zheng Bozhao, 5,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Qifan, 6,000 yuan from the Yingkou Shipping Association, 5,000 yuan from Asiatic Petroleum Company, and 3,000 yuan from Da Lai Shipping Company, totaling 791,006 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Zhu Qinglan Suggests Guiding the Huai River into the Sea To Fundamentally Solve Flood Disasters in the Huai River Basin and Implement Relief Efforts, Guiding the Huai River Should Be Undertaken as a Matter of Utmost Urgency. Upon Reviewing the Plan Announced by the Huai River Guidance Committee, Although It Was Carefully Designed in Advance and Approved by the National Government, the Unprecedented Simultaneous Rise of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers Has Created a New Record. The Unknown Further Rise of the Huai River in the Fifth Year of the Republic of China, as Proposed by the 万国红十字会 民三, Has Likewise Lost Its Basis. Based on My Limited Understanding, I Briefly Offer the Following: (A) Guiding the Huai River into the Sea. Discussions on Whether to Guide the Huai River into the Yangtze or into the Sea Have Been Contentious and Unresolved for Decades. In the Past, Director Zhang had a saying of "70% into the Sea, 30% into the Yangtze." The Huai River Guidance Committee's Plan to Guide the Huai River into the Yangtze Was Based on the Principle of Not Allowing the Yangtze River to Exceed Its Highest Water Level in the Tenth Year of the Republic of China, While Adding an Outlet to the Sea Was Contingent on Future Sufficient Funding (Refer to Section Two of the Huai River Project Plan Published by the Huai River Guidance Committee). An examination of the water level of the Yangtze River this year reveals that it could not be made to exceed the 10th year of the Republic, something that has never occurred since water levels started to be recorded, so the guiding principal of channeling the water into the Yangtze cannot be relied upon. Furthermore, the Yangtze River downstream is affected by tidal influences, and in the Yangzhou area, the Yangtze River, abruptly receiving such a huge amount of water from the Huai River, its impact on areas near the Jinghu area need not be stated. The impact of this year's floods has clearly shown us that the Yangtze River cannot accommodate the Huai River, and the Huai River cannot be reduced, inevitably resulting in both the Yangtze and Huai Rivers suffering harm. Moreover, the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Ji Rivers are the four major rivers of our country, all flowing to the sea. In my opinion, the Huai River should flow into the sea, and the point of entry into the sea should first focus on the area around the Guan River and Haizhou, connecting it to the Longhai Railway to develop the agricultural and industrial areas throughout the Huai River basin. This fundamental water control measure should be based on the facts and not be transferred based on availability of funding. As for the detailed planning of the entry to the sea, it needs to be done by experts. (B) Conscripting Labor and Military Labor Should Be Considered and Compared Simultaneously. The Huai River Committee's plan to enter the river uses the tenth year of the Republic of China as the highest water level of the Yangtze River. This could not have accounted for the surpassing that level. In addition, using the shortest route to save money is also one of the intentions of entering the river. Although the road to the sea can be used by existing waterways, it must be deepened and widened. The length of the route will be three times that of the river entry. Because the amount of soil is large, the cost of labor is huge. This is based on recruitment. Now that the refugees are everywhere, waiting to be fed, if refugees can be conscripted, with labor as relief, the work of digging soil and building embankments is for the farmers, who are accustomed to the work. The people can save themselves with this effort, and work to make sure the Huai River exits on its own forever. This is one way. The military labor policy has been promoted worldwide. Although our country's imitation has not been popularized, it has been effective. Jiangsu Pacification Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang and military commander Liang Guanying have had the same compassionate mindset, and they are stationed in the Huai River Basin. Recently, Liang led his men to dredge the river. If it is possible to organize a military labor force, and use the spirit of bloody battles on the battlefield to compete with the flood, with organization and training, it will be twice as effective with half the effort, and it is also possible to save the cost of labor with wages instead of labor. This is also a way. If the situation can be weighed and properly deployed, labor conscription and military labor can be implemented in sections, so as to compare and encourage each other, the future promotion of waterway management throughout the country will have scale.</p>
<p>▲Five District Relief Commissioners The Disaster Area Work Group of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters, as announced by General Zhu Qinglan, has dispatched relief commissioners to five important disaster areas (Wuhan District, Jiujiang District, Anqing-Wuhu District, Canal District, and Yuezhou in the Xiang River Basin) to handle all relief matters. The names and brief biographies of the commissioners are outlined below. Li Jin is the relief commissioner for the Wuhan District. Zhang Rujun, president of the Tianjin Red Swastika Society, is handling the Wuhu-Anqing District. Zhou Baipeng, the Shandong commissioner of the China International Famine Relief Commission, is the commissioner for the Jiujiang District. Zhang Peinian is the commissioner for the Canal District (or Jiangbei District). Mr. Zhang, named Xi, has experience in salt reclamation and engineering and is familiar with the water conservancy situation in Jiangbei. Zhao Shouyu is the commissioner for the Yuezhou District. He handled road construction relief work during the Shanxi drought in the sixth, ninth, and tenth years of the Republic of China. All of the above individuals have extensive experience and knowledge and will surely be able to fulfill their duties satisfactorily.</p>
<p>▲Disaster Relief Grain Arrives from Various Locations Chairman Song of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters announced: (A) The committee received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping stating that the Northeast provinces donated 30,000 shi of relief grain, half millet and half red grain, which will be shipped as soon as the purchase is completed. (B) Overseas Chinese in Yangon donated 1,400 bags of rice, which are already en route. (C) The National Government Relief Committee has purchased 10,000 bags of rice for emergency relief purposes. (D) The Suiyuan Disaster Relief Committee telegraphed that they donated 1,000 bags of sorghum and are currently trying to transport the relief grain south.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Circles Donate Relief Goods and Funds According to a message from the Japanese Embassy in China, Minister Shigemitsu received a telegram from Tokyo stating that various Japanese circles have decided to dispatch the "Amagisan Maru" from Yokohama on the 10th of this month, carrying 22,000 bags of rice (each bag weighing 150 Japanese kin), 60,000 bags of flour, 30,000 cotton blankets, and a large quantity of condensed milk, worth 10,000 yen. The total value of the above relief goods is 300,000 yen. After receiving the telegram, the ambassador sent a letter to Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters, notifying him that the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 14th of this month. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Department received notification from the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China that the association and the Japan Textile Federation have each donated 50,000 yen, totaling approximately 400,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>▲Zhou Fu and Feng Sui Suggest Zhou Fu, a citizen of this city, and Feng Sui, a member of the Party, and others submitted a petition to the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters yesterday, advocating for a uniform deduction of 1% of the official interest from all companies nationwide for twenty years to be allocated to relief funds. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) From our limited perspective, all companies, factories, and merchants nationwide are collective bodies of capital and the center of the nation's economic power. In the face of national crisis, they should rise up with the spirit of the entire nation to provide relief for the entire nation with the nation's power. Furthermore, companies are mostly organized with shares and very few are individually owned. It is better for the majority to bear a small burden than for the minority to bear a large burden. As citizens, we have repeatedly considered proposing that the council submit a bill requiring all companies, factories, and merchants of a commercial nature to deduct 1% of the official interest from the total amount of paid-in capital for the twentieth year, which must be paid in advance within one month. Those with special circumstances in operations who truly have no profits and cannot maintain the official interest should be allowed to submit a statement to the relevant authorities for appropriate reduction or exemption. Based on this calculation, the power of the whole country can easily raise millions. In general, there are several benefits: the funds are taken from the capital side and do not affect the livelihood of workers, which is one benefit; the operations are already profitable, and the loss of one percent of the official interest in one year is minimal, and there is no feeling on the part of the capital side, which is the second benefit; the shares are raised and allocated pro rata, universally and equally, which is the third benefit; when the company issues interest, the official interest is still distributed according to the original regulations, and the deduction of 1% for disaster relief can be used as a receipt to offset, and there is no damage to business reputation, which is the fourth benefit; all formally established companies have government records to check the number of shares, no need to solicit for donations and without uneven burden, which is the fifth benefit. We believe that this method of raising relief funds is more convenient and easier than any design, which is a matter of national survival. We hereby submit this petition to your department, hoping for adoption and implementation, to alleviate the disaster and relieve the people's lives. Aside from submitting to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, we hereby submit to the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters. Opinion writers: Zhou Fu, Co-signers: Jin Hanzhai, Party members Feng Sui, Wang Huochu, Xu Weimin, You Chengan, Zhang Ziwen, Zhu Jingrong, Tan Zhongguang, Zhuang Zexian, Zhou Mingshan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>▲Division of Emergency Relief Su Province to Handle Emergency Relief in Various Counties. After consultation with the Provincial Relief Committee, Director Cheng Jinsheng of the association decided to assign 16 counties, including Wanyou, to be handled by the association, while 22 counties, including Zhenjiang, will be handled by the Jiangbei Flood Disaster Temporary Relief Association. The Provincial Relief Committee has already resolved to send a letter to the association to follow through. The original text and the number of allocated funds for each county are recorded below. To: We are writing to inform you that the disaster relief funds for various counties, as previously resolved by the 15th meeting of this association, were approved to borrow one million yuan from the construction bonds, sell 200,000 yuan first, add 130,000 yuan to the 130,000 yuan allocated by the Relief Committee, and distribute them together through the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, with the remaining 70,000 yuan reserved for the association's use. Now, Commissioner Cheng Jinsheng stated that the disaster area is vast and the relief work is extensive. If the above funds are distributed by the Shanghai Relief Association alone, it will be difficult to fulfill the wishes. It is proposed that the 16 counties of Jiangpu, Tongshan, Ganyu, Luhe, Yangzhou, Xinghua, Lianshui, Liyang, Huai'an, Baoying, Jintan, Huaiyin, Gaoyou, Siyang, Jiangdu, and Funing still be distributed by the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association. The remaining counties will be assigned to the Jiangbei Flood Disaster Temporary Relief Association for distribution, which will be more convenient to carry out in parallel. Pu An expressed deep agreement with the various sections mentioned by Commissioner Cheng. In response, we ask you to review and handle the matter and reply, and send the relief funds for the 22 counties, including Zhenjiang, totaling 100,002 yuan, together with the remaining allocated funds of 70,000 yuan, to the association for forwarding. The amount of funds is 25,000 yuan for Gaoyou, 20,000 yuan for Xinghua, 10,000 yuan each for Jiangdu, Baoying, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Siyang, Funing, Jiangpu, Tongshan, and Luhe, and 5,000 yuan each for Yangzhou, Jintan, Liyang, and Lianshui, and 3,000 yuan for Ganyu. The above 16 counties will be handled by this association. In addition, 10,000 yuan each for Yancheng, Dongtai, and Taizhou, 6,000 yuan for Xiaoxian, 5,000 yuan each for Rugao, Yixing, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Gaochun, Suqian, Fengxian, and Shuyang, 3,000 yuan each for Taixing, Danyang, Yizheng, Yangshan, Suining, and Pixian, and 2,000 yuan each for Jurong, Lishui, Pei County, and Donghai, totaling 22 counties, will be handled by the Jiangbei Flood Disaster Temporary Relief Association. The total funds for the two associations are 260,000 yuan. However, it is still necessary to wait for the 130,000 yuan allocated by the National Government Relief Committee and the 1 million yuan of construction bonds previously allocated by the provincial government to the association for disaster relief, to mortgage cash with the Shanghai Banking Association, and to release the 130,000 yuan before distribution can be made.</p>
<p>▲Disaster Assessment Report Wang Qijie, Chief of the Document Section of the Association, was dispatched to survey the flood disaster in Baoshan and has returned to Shanghai yesterday. The report is as follows: (1) Pingan Township: The township belongs to Xinsha and has more than 400 households. The entire sand area is about 5,000 to 6,000 mu. This time, the storm surged, and the outer embankments were all broken. Upon inspection, there were many breaches. More than 300 households were destroyed, accounting for 90%. Nine people were drowned. Survivors mostly took refuge on the embankment. Although the water has receded, the crops have been ruined. The few farmland inside the embankments is still being flooded by the morning and afternoon tides due to the breaches not being repaired. It is difficult to expect an autumn harvest, estimated to be no more than 20% to 30%. (2) Ruiyongding Township: The township is a merger of the Ruifeng, Dingxin, and Yongxin sand areas, west of Pingan. It is also a new sand area, with about 7,000 to 8,000 mu of land and more than 500 households. About 30 households in Dingxin. Six people were drowned. The embankments were also breached in many places. The autumn harvest is estimated to be only 30% to 40%. (3) Changxing Township: The township is commonly known as Yawo Sand, east of Pingan. It belongs to the old sand area and is larger in area, with about 10,000 to several thousand mu of farmland and about 1,100 households. 105 households were destroyed by the storm surge. The Dongxing Sand area, which belongs to it, is low-lying, and the collapse is even more severe. 11 people were drowned. There are 34 embankments in the entire township. Except for the inner Zeng and inner Fu embankments, which were fortunately not affected, the destruction of the Zengkang 2357 De and other embankments was quite severe. If they can be repaired separately, the autumn harvest may be 40% to 50%. (4) Shidong Township: The township is north of Ruiyongding, with a smaller area, about 100 to 200 households, and more than 3,000 mu of farmland. The collapse of embankments and houses was quite damaging, but fortunately, there were not many. If the embankments are repaired early, the autumn harvest is expected to be 50% to 60%. Of the above four townships, Pingan was the most severely affected, followed by the others. Looking from above, there are few households. The thatch between the embankments is several feet deep, all of which are tenant houses, scattered by the storm surge. Currently, the owners are mostly waiting and seeing due to the high cost of repairing the embankments. Not only is there no harvest, but it is also difficult to plant wheat. These displaced tenant farmers have no way to find food, and their livelihoods are in despair. It seems that relief should be given from the relief funds.</p>
<p>▲China International Famine Relief Commission Relief Meeting The China International Famine Relief Commission held a board meeting at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss the relief of the flood disaster in Jiangbei.</p>
<p>▲Report by Vice President Gu Vice President Gu Jisheng reported that he and Lu Bohong and Wang Junsheng went to Yangzhou to organize a local branch and start relief efforts. After arriving in Yangzhou, they contacted the president and vice president of the local Chamber of Commerce, as well as Li Siduo of the Xinghua Catholic Church and Peng Siduo of Dongtai, to organize the branch. All parties welcomed the work of the association. It was decided to organize the Yangzhou branch immediately. The victims in the disaster area of Yangzhou had no food or clothing, and the situation was extremely miserable. Xinghua looked like the bottom of a cauldron, and the disaster was the most serious. At present, there are many charitable organizations starting emergency relief, but the most important thing to pay attention to is the preparation for winter relief. Because the flood came suddenly, the victims were able to escape, but most of them escaped in single clothes, and some were naked. Because the weather was still hot at that time. Now that the weather is getting colder, and the west wind is blowing, the victims will freeze to death without clothing. It is urgent to prepare relief clothing. Because it takes time to make clothes, it takes time to transport clothes, and it takes time to distribute them. It is not too early to prepare now. Therefore, all parties hope that the association will pay attention to this, and ask for discussion and resolution on how to handle it.</p>
<p>▲Resolution on the Distribution of Relief Funds The funds that the association has already allocated for emergency relief in Jiangbei include 10,000 yuan for Yancheng, 10,000 yuan for Taizhou, 8,000 yuan for Xinghua, 10,000 yuan for Yangzhou, and 5,000 yuan for Qingjiangpu and Huai'an. Now that the Yangzhou branch is organized, it is decided to allocate another 30,000 yuan and invite Li Siduo of Xinghua and Peng Siduo of Dongtai to join the Yangzhou branch to handle the distribution. As for cotton clothing, it was previously decided to make 10,000 sets, which is a drop in the bucket. It was decided to make another 20,000 sets to avoid digging a well when thirsty. Furthermore, the Hunan Association in Shanghai sent a letter stating that the province's flood disaster affected 54 counties, requesting an allocation of funds. It was decided to allocate 5,000 yuan for emergency use by the association.</p>

<p>A Kobe dispatch stated that the flood in Hankou has spread to various places along the river, drowning living beings and causing great disasters. Overseas Chinese in Japan were heartbroken by the tragic news. Zhou Jue, the Consul General in Hanshin, also saw the seriousness of the matter and invited more than ten representatives from various organizations and institutions to gather at the consulate at 1:00 PM on August 28 to discuss solutions. After about an hour of discussion, they resolved to organize the Kobe Overseas Chinese National Flood Disaster Relief Association in Japan, and publicly elected Consul General Zhou as the chairman, and requested the appointment of staff, distributed donation books, and called on all overseas Chinese to save money and energy. In this period of recession, various circles also ignored it and cooperated enthusiastically. It is planned to end within a month. At that time, it is expected that a large amount of funds can be raised and remitted to the appropriate disaster relief agencies. The list of committee members is as follows: Chairman, Consul General Zhou Jue stationed in Hanshin, Vice Chairman, Huang Shu'an, Li Jingyu, Bai Shi, Yang Shoupeng, Treasurer, He Shaoyao, Auditors, Zhou Qibo, Chen Shubin, Clerks, Geng Junheng, Zeng Yanhua, Wang Jiechen, Jian Yinnan, Secretaries, Gu Ruibao, Tan Taide, Wu Wei, Wang Tianmin, Chen Shusheng, Qin Guansong.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Relief News from the Wuxi Fellow Townsmen Association <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Wuxi Fellow Townsmen Association on Pu Road held a joint meeting of council members to raise relief funds to relieve the flood disasters in Wuxi and other provinces. They also prepared donation books and asked various staff members to solicit donations separately. Currently, Jiangbei and Lixiahe counties have been severely affected by the disaster and are in urgent need of relief. They have allocated 1,000 yuan from the first batch of 1,240 yuan received and sent it to the Jiangsu Bank for forwarding to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association. They have also sent a letter urging various staff members to solicit donations quickly and submit the donations to the association for allocation to the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee to relieve the disaster victims in their hometown. In addition, the association has been entrusted by the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters to collect disaster relief clothing and bedding. Fellow townsmen in Shanghai who have relief funds, clothing, and old clothes, shoes, and hats for men and women can send them to the association at No. 278 Qipu Road for forwarding. Furthermore, the association recently received telegrams from the Wuxi County Magistrate and the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee informing of the disaster situation. The county magistrate's telegram stated that since two months, the heavens have been raining continuously, causing a flood disaster. The low-lying areas of Wuxi have been submerged in more than 280,000 mu of farmland, accounting for more than 20% of the county's farmland. The embankments have been broken and the shores have collapsed, turning into a water country. The seedlings are rotten, and the mulberry plants are withering. Not only is there no hope for future harvests, but the number of autumn silkworm farming is also greatly reduced. Chuande personally went to various townships to inspect and felt heartbroken by what he saw. The Party and government agencies and various legal organizations have jointly organized the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee, which was temporarily established in the County Chamber of Commerce on the 18th of last month. However, the disaster is severe, and relief is difficult. We have always admired your enthusiasm for public welfare and charity. We have made great efforts to comfort our hometown in peacetime. We have sent you this telegram to seek your advice and assistance so that the victims of the flood will not be displaced. We deeply hope for this. Wuxi County Magistrate Chen Chuande kowtows. Tang Weizhi and Hua Yishan, the president and vice president of the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee, telegraphed that the silkworm harvest in our county has been lost, followed by a flood disaster. The farmland has been submerged, and there is no hope for an autumn harvest. This must be clear to you. However, we have received news from afar, such as Jiangbei, and near, such as Wuhan, and there are constant requests for relief. If we do not plan comprehensively, we fear that we will be exhausted in providing relief. We look forward to the future with trepidation. Therefore, the local Party and government agencies and charitable organizations initiated the organization of the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee in the County Chamber of Commerce on August 31 of this year, and publicly elected Wen Zhi and Wen Chuan as president and vice president, and established an office in the County Association immediately to pool our efforts to comprehensively plan for the flood disaster in our county and the donation relief matters everywhere. Wen Zhi and Wen Chuan are getting old, but we dare not complain about the efforts for the sake of good deeds. This year's flood has swept across the country, and Wuxi has also been hit by a silkworm famine. The homes in the four villages are all hanging upside down. We must help others and help ourselves. Our hearts are long and our strength is short, and we are deeply afraid that we will not be able to bear the burden. We ask you to give us advice and assistance at any time. In addition to waiting for the donation books of this association to be printed and sent for your review, we also hope to give advice. Tang Wenzhi, President of the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee, and Hua Yishan, Vice President, kowtow. The association has replied separately by telegram, continuing to raise relief funds. Once a certain amount has been collected, it will be allocated to Wuxi for relief.</p>

<p>To all Shanghai newspaper offices, transferred to all charitable organizations: As per the previous telegram, winter has brought fierce winds and torrential rains. The massive flooding has destroyed urban and rural houses, drowning countless people and livestock. Refugees clinging to treetops and rooftops await rescue by boats. Provincial governments and charitable organizations have dispatched boats for days, but they are insufficient to provide relief. We earnestly beseech you to consider the dire situation and promptly send a large number of boats and dry rations to Xinghua day and night to save lives. We convey this plea with tears and utmost urgency. Hua Zhen, Gao Henian, and Shi Mingyong, etc., Xinghua County Magistrate and concurrently Chairman of the Provisional Disaster Relief Committee, bow.

<h3 id="e113">Continued Reports of Disaster Situation in Various Counties of Anhui <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲ In Quanjiao, flash floods occurred, drowning countless people and livestock. Dikes and embankments were completely turned into swamps, and the number of houses that collapsed is incalculable.</p>
<p>▲ In Hanshan, more than sixty embankments across the county, totaling over one hundred li, were all breached. The number of houses and livestock swept away is countless. Hundreds of thousands of survivors are naked in the water, without clothing, food, or shelter. Their cries of hunger and cold are unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>▲ In Hefei, flash floods occurred, and the city and countryside were completely turned into swamps. Dikes and embankments were all destroyed, and fields and houses were swept away without a trace. The number of people and livestock who died is incalculable.</p>
<p>▲ In Lujiang, flash floods occurred, and more than seventy embankments along the river successively collapsed. Even high-lying cultivated fields were submerged. The entire area is a vast expanse of water, and people and livestock were swept away. Those who did not die in the water also lack clothing and food.</p>
<p>▲ In Tongcheng, the river rose sharply and embankments collapsed. Houses were barely visible above the water, and the number of people and livestock drowned is even harder to count. In Chenjia Island alone, there are already 40,000 displaced people. The disaster situation in Qingcaogema in the western countryside is even more dire.</p>
<p>▲ In Dangtu, flash floods occurred. A total of 370-380 large and small embankments, totaling 600,000 mu, were completely submerged. Houses collapsed, and people and livestock were drowned. 300,000 disaster victims are sleeping in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, their faces emaciated and their bodies gaunt, a truly unbearable sight.</p>
<h3 id="e114">All Sectors Enthusiastically Assist in Disaster Relief <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲ Real Estate Association Urges Property Owners to Assist in Disaster Relief The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to all property owners yesterday, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: This time, the national flood has affected a wide area, covering sixteen or seventeen provinces, leaving fifty to sixty million compatriots without food, shelter, or clothing. All those with a sense of humanity cannot but feel compassion and rush to donate. Various sectors in Shanghai are enthusiastically contributing and generously donating money and goods. Even hawkers and children are tightening their belts and giving alms. We in the real estate sector must not lag behind in such righteous acts. The Feng Jishan Hall's advocacy of donating rent is a precedent. I once heard Mr. Duan Zhiquan say, '(For the majority of people, danger is imminent, and social unrest will soon erupt; for the minority of people, how can they be safe?)' Although only a few words, the meaning is profound. Looking around Shanghai, due to the impact of the economy, hidden dangers are already worrisome. Shanghai's commerce is most heavily influenced by the Yangtze River region. If the people of the entire country do not cooperate and work together to provide relief for this flood, Shanghai's commerce will surely plummet. Therefore, this generous donation is actually a strategy to save people and save ourselves. We are writing to request that you examine the situation, act righteously, and generously contribute. If you wish to donate, please send the funds to the Real Estate Trust Department of the Sichuan Road Zhejiang Industrial Bank for collection in the name of the Real Estate Association's fundraising, and obtain a receipt from the disaster relief organization to show the responsibility of our real estate sector. The following have already pledged donations: Mr. Hui Yanfang, 5,000 yuan; Mr. Bao Yaoting, 3,000 yuan; Jiang Chongde Dang, 1,500 yuan; Mr. Li Bohan, 1,000 yuan; Real Estate Department of the Continental Bank, 1,000 yuan; Mr. Lu Youshen, 500 yuan; Runde Company, 100 yuan; Hongle Company, 50 yuan; He Kun Company, 100 yuan; Gu Lanji, 1,000 yuan. Various sectors have high expectations for our real estate sector. Please do your best, each according to your conscience and ability. We are most grateful. Sincerely wish you prosperity."</p>

<p>Since Japan recognized Shanghai as a port with an epidemic, it has required all passengers going to Japan from Shanghai to be tested for feces. Recently, under the pretext of epidemic testing, it has refused to sell ship tickets to Chinese people, effectively preventing Chinese people from going abroad. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Postal Company Stops Selling Ship Tickets The Japanese Postal Company has now received an order from its headquarters, citing epidemic prevention reasons, to stop selling ship tickets to Chinese passengers going to Yokohama from Shanghai. The reason is to prevent the spread of epidemics, but in reality, it is to prevent Chinese third-class passengers from going to that port. Therefore, Chinese people who have recently purchased passenger tickets to land at Yokohama from Japanese shipping companies have been refused.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Mail Ships Prohibit Chinese Passengers Japanese mail ships traveling from Shanghai to the Orient include European and American routes. It has now been decided that for any Chinese people going to Japan, except for ships specifically sailing between China and Japan, those who have booked third-class seats on various mail ships will not be allowed to board. This prohibition on Chinese people buying mail ship tickets has already begun.</p>

<p>Determines Five-Year Industry Plan</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Design Association held its sixth committee meeting yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's regular meeting room. Li Wenjie chaired, and Secretary Xue Guangqian recorded. After reporting matters, the following resolutions were made: (1) Discussing the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's letter stating that the methods prescribed in the council's resolution on disposing of Japanese goods are particularly difficult, and requesting that more appropriate and quick methods be devised. It was resolved that, according to the original intention of the methods, scattered goods were not included in the list of goods to be stored in warehouses. (2) Discussing Committee Member Que Pingzhi's proposal to urge industrial factories to intensify production in order to implement the goal of permanent boycott. It was resolved to adopt and implement it. (3) Discussing the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter transferring three opinions of the Chinese Cereals and Oil Cake Industry Association on resisting Japanese goods. (2) Resolved: (1) Foreign goods handled by Japanese merchants are absolutely boycotted. It was decided that foreign goods should avoid being transported by Japanese ships or stored in Japanese warehouses as much as possible. (3) Domestic goods can be freely exported. It was also decided that the five-year industry plan is of great importance to China's future, and it is not enough to establish a long-term plan without gathering experts from all over the country to discuss it at length. The association should wait for the establishment of the National Anti-Japanese Association, and then jointly discuss the steps to be taken to draft it, in order to collect opinions from all sides and avoid omissions.</p>

<p>This year, China's floods have been severe, and countries with even a slight sense of humanity have risen up and come to China to donate money or provide relief to save the disaster-stricken people. The United States has the organization of the Salvation Army, which has specially dispatched a team to China due to the extraordinary severity of the Chinese flood. They will set up soup kitchens in areas most severely affected by the disaster. A group of over one hundred people is scheduled to arrive in China in the latter half of this month.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department yesterday ordered the county construction bureaus, stating: "In order to comply, it is found that this summer, there has been continuous rainfall, and the amount of rainfall has been particularly high, resulting in rivers overflowing and dikes collapsing. The severity of the disaster in the province is rare in recent years. Recently, many counties have reported on the flood situation and requested methods for relief, but they are all briefly mentioned without detailed information. For both symptomatic and fundamental solutions, and to plan for relief, it is necessary to investigate and clarify the flood situation in all counties of the province to facilitate overall planning. In addition to distributing, a flood investigation form has been formulated and is attached. You are required to comply, fill in each item in detail, and report back as soon as possible. These are the instructions. Details are as follows: Matters to be investigated and reported: (Rainfall) Total rainfall for July and August, rainfall on the day with the greatest heavy rain. (Flood situation) Cause of the disaster, area affected, which area is most severely affected, degree of damage to fields and crops, number of dike breaches and length of damaged dikes, condition of damaged gates and dikes, number of people drowned, situation of people displaced, other losses (Rescue situation) Number of dike repairmen, number of gate repairs, number of dike repairs (Relief methods) Current relief methods, fundamental solutions."</p>
<h3 id="e121">National Chamber of Commerce Cables to Request the Prohibition of Illegal Taxation at Aigun Customs <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce cabled the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the National Government yesterday, stating: "We recently received a letter from the Aigun-Heihe Chamber of Commerce in Heilongjiang, stating: 'The establishment of customs is originally a taxation authority for foreign countries, and its taxation scope is limited to exports and imports. The so-called exports and imports refer to international trade, not that it is an export just by going in and out of the local area. However, Aigun Customs (stationed in Heihe) does not ask whether the goods are entering or leaving Chinese ports, and taxes them all uniformly. Even goods traveling back and forth between Heihe and Harbin that have already been taxed cannot escape the example of repeated taxation. Such collection, similar to likin, is obviously inconsistent with the principle of one tax per item. Furthermore, the taxation of Aigun Customs is purely limited to river transportation, while goods coming and going by land are ignored. We think that the transportation of goods by river and land are both within the scope of Heihe, so why is river transportation taxed, while land transportation is uniquely exempt from taxation? Such unfairness will inevitably drive merchants to land routes. Furthermore, the taxation of Manzhouli and Suifenhe Customs is limited to exported goods only, otherwise they are exempt. Why is Aigun Customs the opposite of this principle? At a time when customs autonomy is being implemented and likin is being abolished, our country's industries and the south should implement protection policies to resist foreign merchants. Unexpectedly, commercial decline and deterioration are inevitable in all places where customs are established. For example, in the remote Sanxing, commerce has become increasingly prosperous and the locality has gradually flourished since the abolition of customs. It is conceivable whether customs are harmful to the people. Heihe is now in the same situation as Sanxing before the abolition of customs. If we do not provide relief soon, I am afraid there will never be a day of recovery. Therefore, we implore your association to quickly forward this request to the central management authorities to correct this situation as soon as possible to benefit merchants and the people.' Upon receiving this, we found that customs taxation has its own regulations. If it is as stated by the association, it will inevitably violate the law, harm merchants, and hinder business. It is reasonable to cable your government departments for inspection. We earnestly implore you to quickly order correction to relieve merchants in difficulty. Chairman Lin Kanghou of the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, and Peng Chuli, bow. Yang Yin."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Zheng Yuanxing Talks About Egg Product Registration Rules <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Management Rules for Foreign Trade Registration of Egg Products, drafted by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for promulgation and implementation. A Shanghai press reporter visited Mr. Zheng Yuanxing, Chairman of the Shanghai Egg Industry Association, yesterday to ask for his opinion on the rules. The following is an excerpt from his conversation: (Question) According to the Management Rules for Foreign Trade Registration of Egg Products, it is necessary to obtain guarantees from two reputable businesses in the same industry. Do you feel that this is inconvenient for your industry? (Answer) Since the implementation of these registration rules, there has been no inconvenience to our industry. Because there are not many businesses in our industry, and there is considerable contact due to foreign relations, we all know each other's financial strength, credit, experience, and products. Therefore, obtaining guarantees from businesses in the same industry is easier than obtaining guarantees from other industries. (Question) Egg products should be reported for inspection when exported. If the Inspection Bureau inspects carefully, inferior goods cannot be exported by obfuscation. Why is it necessary to obtain guarantees from businesses in the same industry? (Answer) Inspecting egg products is different from inspecting other goods. If export manufacturers, in the event of unavoidable circumstances, intentionally take chances and occasionally try, then no matter how strict the inspection is, it is impossible to prevent it. The case reported in the Chinese and foreign newspapers this year, where a certain company was sued in court after being discovered by a foreign buyer for mixing water into eggs and exporting them, can serve as clear proof. As far as I can see, the reason why the rules require guarantees from businesses in the same industry is because the Inspection Bureau cannot supervise everything, and wants to use mutual supervision among businesses in the same industry to prevent problems before they arise. (Question) Have all Chinese and foreign egg exporters completely complied with the current registration requirements? (Answer) As far as I know, they have all complied. (Question) Can you guarantee that egg exports will be completely good in the future and avoid foreign excuses? (Answer) If the Ministry of Industry can insist on obtaining guarantees from two reputable businesses in the same industry for the registration of export eggs by commodity inspection bureaus across the country, foreign excuses can be avoided. At this point, Mr. Zheng solemnly said to the reporter, "In recent years, competition in the international market for egg products has been extremely fierce. Our egg industry colleagues must be of one heart and one mind, and strive for the excellence of goods and the balance of prices. Even a slight carelessness will give our enemies excellent propaganda material, and put our industry in a situation from which it cannot recover. It is chilling to think about. Therefore, our industry should be vigilant and do well on its own, without waiting for government supervision." He then excused himself and left.</p>

<p>Intended Use of Boxer Indemnity for Construction Costs</p>
<p>According to sources in the transportation sector, the construction of the Cao'e River steel bridge on the Hangzhou-Ningbo section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been delayed for sixteen years. The Ministry of Railways now plans to use the Italian return of the Boxer Indemnity for construction, to connect the railway and complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway.

<p>Because the International Telecommunication Bureau has not yet obtained formal communication with Saigon and Siam through the International Radio Station, it has recently purchased two Siemens Telefunken radio stations to prepare for the need for direct communication with the above-mentioned places. However, because the Zhenru and Fenglinqiao radio stations no longer have room for these new machines, the bureau is building a new house near the Zhenru radio station. After completion, the new machines will be installed there. It is said that it will take three months before communication with Japan and other countries can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Taxpayers' Association Discusses the Text Format of Water Bills <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Directly Stopping Water Supply to Residents is Not Allowed</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the British-owned Shanghai Water Company, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: We have received your letter of September 5 regarding the addition of Chinese text on water bills, and the sample bill you attached. We are very impressed with your company's respect for Chinese opinions. However, after reviewing it, we feel that the format of the bill receipt is still difficult to understand, as the method of arranging Chinese and English is completely different. For example, the item of silver number is still recorded in Arabic numerals, which may not be entirely appropriate. Furthermore, 'water supply contract (No.)' is even more incomprehensible. It may be better to change it to 'water supply according to the contract,' which seems clearer. The phrase 'small foreign money (or auxiliary currency) according to the city's exchange rate' is more common. Adding the word 'calculation' makes it awkward. The following is what this association would like your company to pay special attention to, that is, the layer of water outage for non-payment of water bill. This association believes that at least it should follow the method of non-payment of rent (and the rented house is not a patent, and the landlord cannot directly stop renting the house). However, for the patented water, and those who have no substitutes available, and without legal procedures to stop the direct action of supply, there are many abuses. This association believes that there should be room for detailed consideration, and the excessive discrepancy in the phrase 'or its predecessor' should also be removed. According to this association's opinion, if it is changed to 'If this account is not paid by ○ month 28, the company may handle it according to law,' it would be more legal and reasonable. A corresponding letter is sent to you, and we hope that you will check and handle it."</p>

<p>Five Conditions Stipulated</p>
<p>Tenants Given a Fixed Time to Vacate</p>
<p>The buildings at Zhifu Lane near the Nanjing Road and Fujian Road intersection are the property of the Da Lun Real Estate Company. Previously, due to the establishment of the Great China Department Store, the company intended to rebuild a seven-story building and notified all tenants, including Lao Da Fang and Chang Feng Hang, to relocate. This resulted in a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. The initial trial resulted in a loss for the landlord. Da Lun Company, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed. The Court of Appeal sent the case back to the original court for retrial. It is now heard that the attorneys for the appellant, Li Zuyu and Qin Liankui, and the attorney for the appellee, Wang Youling, repeatedly negotiated an amicable resolution. A settlement agreement was reached, and a request was made to the First Special District Court to close the case. Yesterday, Judge Li Mo held a hearing. The attorneys for both parties explained the terms of the settlement. Five conditions were stipulated: (1) Due to the difficulty for the tenants to relocate immediately, the landlord allows the tenants an extension to relocate, with two years and four months from September of this year as the final relocation period. Regardless of any reason, they must relocate by that time. The landlord will also have the right to demolish or reclaim the property at that time. (2) During the extension period, the tenants will continue to pay rent at the original rate, paying in advance and not delaying. (3) The previously owed rent (more than ten months) must be paid in a lump sum for eight months, with the remaining amount paid one month at a time until cleared. (4) If any of the above conditions are violated, immediate relocation is required. (5) The litigation costs will be borne by the plaintiff and defendant respectively, and a request to close the case was made. Thus, a property dispute case came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Zhu Yunqing Kidnapped Yesterday <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A car was parked at the gate of Zhen He Tea House, No. 173, Lane 6, De'an Lane, North Shanxi Road, Zhengjia Mu Bridge, French Concession. The tea house is owned by the wealthy merchant Zhu Baoyuan. It has been in operation for many years and has accumulated considerable wealth, making it a target for kidnappers. His third son, named Yunqing, lives separately at No. 94 in the lane next to the Republican Theater on Fangbang Bridge in the South City. Every morning around 7:00 a.m., he takes his private car to the Zhen He Tea House to work, returning home only after 11:00 p.m. It has become a habit. Yesterday evening at 11:30 p.m., the chauffeur, Chen Zhengfu from Zhenjiang, was driving him back south when they arrived at the iron gate of Zheng Mu Bridge in the French Concession. A covered car was parked on the side of the road, facing north, license number 10009. Three people were sitting in the car. Upon seeing Zhu's car, two people jumped out, drew handguns, and prohibited any outcry. They forced Zhu Yunqing into the car, and the kidnapper driver sped south. The chauffeur, Chen Zhengfu, was so frightened by the sight that he stood frozen like a wooden chicken. Only after the car had gone far did he shout loudly for the police to come. He accompanied the police to the Grand Self-Ringing Bell Police Station to report the incident. The police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush out to search, but the kidnapping was already like chasing a yellow crane. Later, Chen Zhengfu returned home and reported the kidnapping to the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Impersonating the Wenzhou Fuzi Qianzhuang</p>
<p>Defrauding the Shanghai Tongyi Company</p>
<p>The Wenzhou Fuzi Qianzhuang has had dealings with the Tongyi Trust Company at No. 126 Beijing Road, Shanghai. On the 31st of last month, the Tongyi Company suddenly received an urgent letter from the Fuzi Qianzhuang, stating that Zhu Ming was being sent to deliver 100,000 yuan in Post-Reorganization and Disbandment Government Bonds, and requesting them to hand them over to him to take down. The letter was prominently stamped with the Fuzi Qianzhuang's seal and the manager's chop. Soon after, Zhu Ming arrived with a letter from the Fuzi Qianzhuang to collect the government bonds. The company handed them over in full, and Zhu left with them. In the afternoon, Tongyi suddenly received a telegram from the Fuzi Qianzhuang, stating that the bank's seal had been lost, and that if anyone came to collect anything, they should refuse to hand it over. Tongyi was greatly alarmed and immediately telegraphed Fuzi, informing them that someone had already taken 100,000 yuan in government bonds. The Fuzi Qianzhuang then sent staff to Shanghai and investigations revealed that Dai Dingfu of Hangzhou was deeply involved in the case. They reported this to the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, who arrested Dai. At the same time, Xu Bohua was also arrested. Xu was released after questioning revealed he was not involved, while Dai confessed that Zeng Liulin and Zhu Xiang (who claimed to be Zhu Ming) were the main culprits. He said that Zeng lived in Room 511 of the East Asia Hotel in Shanghai. The Tongyi Company reported this to the General Police Station on the previous day, and detectives Liu Xiangzhai and others were ordered to go to Room 511 of the East Asia Hotel, where they arrested Zhao Luoshu, Chen Susheng, and Chen Yaoyao. Xu Bohua was also in the room and was arrested along with them. However, Zeng Liulin had already fled after hearing the news. Zhao and the other three were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Summary Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case and stated that it was not yet clear whether Zhao and the other three were involved in the case, so the police were not prosecuting them. He only requested that they be temporarily detained for further investigation. Judge Jiang Gongliang reviewed the report and questioned Zhao Luoshu and the others, then ordered that they be temporarily detained.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Large-Scale Theft of Valuable Woolen Cloth from German Ship <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen People Involved Arrested</p>
<p>Court Held a Preliminary Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th of last month, at 2:30 a.m., forty-two pieces of woolen cloth worth over 10,000 taels of silver were stolen from the German merchant ship "Bowness", which was docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Machinery Wharf. On the previous day, the Water Police, together with Chinese detectives Liu Baoshan, Chen Ruhai, and Xu Yongyuan from the Huishan Police Station, and Russian detectives, arrested sixteen suspects, including Tang Xiaohangzi, Han Ke, Shang Wei, and Zhou Zhihe, at various locations including Broadway Road, Fuzhou Road, the Shangxian Hotel, Xizang Road, Nanjing Road, and Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. All the stolen goods were recovered, along with 800 yuan in silver notes that Zhou Zhihe had stored at the Shangxian Hotel. All were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case, stating that the recovered woolen cloth had not been taxed by customs. Now, the Customs Service has a letter stating that the cloth should be inspected by customs. If no original owner claims it, it will be considered tax evasion and will belong to the state. Therefore, Bai Liqi, a Western officer representing the Water Police, was sent to the court and presented the letter. Then, the Chinese and Western detectives explained the circumstances of the arrests and handed over the seized original woolen cloth and silver notes. Bai Liqi, the Western officer of the Water Police, requested that the woolen cloth be taken back to customs for safekeeping. When Tang Xiaohangzi was questioned, he claimed that he knew nothing about the theft from the ship and had been mistakenly arrested. Detective Liu of the police station stated that his statement was false and that he had identified Yuan Da, Zhang Xiaozhang, Chen Erxi, Chen Erbianzi, and others. Han Ke stated that he was a dockworker and had been invited by Li Jinyu to help unload goods for a reward. Later, he was arrested at the Shangxian Hotel. Shang Wei gave a similar statement. Yuan Da also stated that he was a dockworker and had been invited by Li to move cloth and load it onto a barge, receiving ten yuan. Zhang Xiaozhang stated that he was selling beer on the ship when he saw many people moving cloth. He was given seventeen yuan by Li and told not to make a sound. Shang Liexi, Zhu Xiaokouzi, Zhong Xiaosheng, Chen Erxi, and Chen Erbianzi all stated that they were dockworkers and had been invited by Li to be lookouts on the ship, each receiving five yuan. Liu Jinbo stated that he was arrested while going to Shang Lie's place to collect rent. Zhou Zhihe stated that he was a foreign goods broker and Li Jinyu had asked him to sell the woolen cloth, saying it was water-damaged goods from Hankou, or to use it as collateral. He then entrusted Dai Junji to sell it on his behalf. When questioned, Dai admitted that he was entrusted by Zhou to take the goods to his relative Zhu Xinyang to sell, but they were not needed and were used as collateral for 4,725.40 taels of silver. He did not know that the goods were stolen and he and Zhou only earned a small commission. Chen Xinsheng stated that he and Zhou Zhihe were at the Changle Teahouse on Fuzhou Road when Li Jinyu asked him to sell the woolen cloth, and he entrusted it to Zhou Zhihe, knowing that it was water-damaged goods from Hankou. If he could sell it, he would earn some commission. Han Lide stated that he was an employee at a native goods store at the Xinqiao Tou in the West Gate. He happened to be at Zhang Xiaozhang's place to collect money when he was mistakenly arrested. Zhu Xinyang stated that he was harmed by his relative Dai Junji, who forced him to take twenty-four pieces of the woolen cloth as collateral. At the time, he asked in detail whether the goods were reliable. He guaranteed that they would not cause any trouble and that they were definitely water-damaged goods from Hankou, which is why he paid the silver. The price was almost the same as the market price. He hired two lawyers, Wu Linkun and Wang Fuchang, to request bail. Judge Shen Bingrong ordered that all be remanded except for those who provided reliable shopkeepers as guarantors, and adjourned the hearing. The stolen goods were temporarily taken away by the Jianghai Customs.</p>

<p>His Son Imprisoned for Theft</p>
<p>Court Has Approved a Retrial</p>
<p>Wu Jinting, the twenty-year-old son of Wu Jinming, the owner of the Wu Xinchang Silver Shop in Zhoupu Town, Nanhui, previously studied at the Huadong School of Law and Politics in this city. After the closure of Huadong, he transferred to the Jiangwan Road College of Law. Last year, he met Shi Yuying, a female student at a certain sports school, which caused resentment from a love rival, Person A. Person A lured him to a certain restaurant under the pretext of mediation, and then drugged Wu Jinting and sent him to the Yue Dong Hotel. Later, detectives from the French Police Station discovered that Wu Jinting was suspected of being a thief, and seized a handgun and stolen goods. After interrogation by the former French Concession Police, he was sentenced to five years in prison and sent to prison. He was cut off from his family for nearly a year. Recently, his father entrusted someone to come to Shanghai to search for him and learned the truth. His father, Jinming, came to Shanghai a few days ago and hired two lawyers, Jin Yu and Li Yuan, to file a petition with the Second Special District Court requesting a retrial of the theft case committed by Jinting. The court has now approved the request. Yesterday, Judge Luo Renji ordered Wu Jinming to appear in court for questioning to investigate the evidence of the applicant's request for a retrial.

<p>The Ewo (Jardine) Company's Fuhe ship, which came to Shanghai from Chongqing, was inspected by officials from the Yichang Customs and Special Tax Office when it was loading goods in Yichang on the first of this month. Ninety-five boxes of smuggled soil, weighing more than 2,000 taels, were found in the fifth cargo hold in the engine room. The two compradores, Zhou, were detained on the spot. Later, it was found that the soil was brought by a female passenger surnamed Ma in collusion with the ship's engineers. After the incident, the female passenger and the engineers had already fled, and the soil was confiscated.</p>
<p>Failed Attempt to Rob Soil</p>
<p>Handgun and Ammunition Recovered</p>
<p>Tian Jingsan, the police chief of the Zhabei Water Patrol Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and inspector Jiang Baoyu, were patrolling near the Suzhou River Rainbow Bridge around 5:00 PM on the 7th of this month when they saw a small boat parked by the shore, which looked very suspicious. Upon seeing the police boat approaching, two people abandoned the boat and fled ashore. The police officers arrested Xu Yulin. A paper package containing a loaded Browning handgun and four bullets was found in the boat. The suspect was taken to the team for preliminary interrogation. Xu Yulin confessed that he was forty-three years old, from Kunshan, and used to run a rice shop. Hearing that people from Nanxun and Zhenze were coming to Shanghai to sell soil, he and his friend Huang Zhushan and one unknown person were waiting here to rob them. Huang, who lives in Zhujiajiao, was one of the people who fled ashore. After reviewing the confession, Police Officer Li ordered that the suspect and the weapon be sent to the Judicial Section for trial.</p>

<p>Yu Zaifu's Plight is Dire</p>
<p>Tang Yang's Generosity is Admirable</p>
<p>Yu Zaifu, a native of Ningbo, had been in Hankou. This time, due to the floods, he brought his concubine, Pan, and his five-year-old son, Shi Gen, to Shanghai to seek refuge, staying at a friend's house in Zhabei Datong Road. Due to lack of livelihood, the concubine Pan was introduced to work in a sock factory, but it was still difficult to make ends meet. So, Zaifu, behind his concubine's back, sold his son Bao Gen to Tang Yang at No. 37 Tangjia Lane for 30 yuan. However, Pan cherished the child very much and forced her concubine Zaifu to redeem him, resulting in a dispute and brawl that was reported to the Huishi Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, the situation was found to be pitiful. Tang Yang was summoned and ordered to hand over the boy she had bought. Tang Yang also expressed sympathy and was willing to forgo the 30 yuan she had paid. Thus, the family was reunited and thanked them endlessly.</p>

<p>The home of Jin Youzhang, located at No. 21 Huade Road, Hongkou, was broken into by thief Xu Guohai and Qian Baobin, among others, on the morning of October 20th of last year at around 8:00 a.m. They took valuables worth more than 1,000 yuan, divided the spoils, and fled without a trace.

He did not hold on and lost his balance, suddenly falling into the river. Before he could be rescued, he tragically drowned and disappeared. Afterwards, the boatman, Miao Chunchun, and the witness, Lu Xirong, reported to the Water Patrol Station for record. (2) Boat Crew: Zhang Awei, a local, over fifty years old, was a boatman since childhood. He is currently working on the Taikoo Company's No. 4 barge. He is addicted to alcohol and always gets drunk. Friends and relatives have repeatedly advised him to stop, but he does not listen. At 10:00 PM the night before last, he bought wine and drank heavily again, until he was completely drunk. Everyone advised him to go ashore and go home, but he refused and fell asleep on the boat, snoring loudly. He accidentally rolled over and fell into the river. By the time his fellow crew members noticed, Zhang had already sunk to the bottom of the river and could not be rescued. By 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, his body suddenly floated to the surface in the same spot. The crew pulled it onto the boat, and the family took the body home for funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>The YWCA, in response to the enthusiastic desire for knowledge among female workers, continued its women workers' night school even during the sweltering summer. Students, except for a few female factory workers who were too exhausted from overwork to attend, overcame the summer heat, balancing work and study, which is admirable. This is also due to the appropriate measures taken by the YWCA in recent years, implementing classroom teaching and group training, emphasizing practicality, enabling female workers to understand the status of labor and modern economic and industrial systems, realizing the importance of learning, and preparing them to enhance their personality and life.</p>

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<p>Message from Mr. Ye Jingxin</p>
<p>The most important question is the future of university students. What puzzles me is that Chinese universities only teach people to be active within the school. Once they graduate, they truly "graduate," not only from their university studies but also from any potential career in society. Naturally, everyone is shouting, "There's nothing to do!" and complaining, "Can't find a job!" Are there no unfinished tasks in the world? Are there no remaining careers waiting for someone to pursue? Social scholars wearing their glasses can understand the crux of the matter and express sympathy, pitying the unemployed students, or even shouting a few words of encouragement. However, the friends who were about to secure a position but suddenly had the offer rescinded and are now unemployed continue to write numerous articles asking "What should we do?" that remain on paper. I sincerely seek a solution from the reporter, a practical way to provide university students with a path forward. Please answer this public concern in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) The problem probably doesn't lie solely after graduation but largely in the university education itself. It involves the issues before students enter university and during their studies, and partly the economic recession.</p>
<p>The economic recession involves too many aspects to discuss for now.</p>
<p>As far as we know, there is currently a shortage of engineering talents and medical professionals. Even notices are posted seeking certain experts, but no one applies. This shows that society doesn't lack a need for talent, but the talents being cultivated don't match the demand. This is something that university departments and students should pay attention to early on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the teaching方針 and methods of universities and the attitude of university students towards their studies are also connected to the issue of future career paths. This also deserves attention.</p>
<p>For now, let's focus solely on solving the difficulty of finding employment after graduation.</p>
<p>The difficulty in finding employment mainly involves seeking jobs from others. Since seeking jobs from others is ineffective, let's think about seeking our own way. For example, several like-minded people could collaborate on writing or translating books. We know selling manuscripts is very difficult and frustrating. However, I believe that if the selected topics are indeed needed by society, or if it's a translation, send the original book or a trial translation to the purchasing organization for review. If it truly moves them, they will definitely be happy to accept it. This method can also enhance one's own knowledge. This is just an example, and there might be similar methods.</p>
<p>However, not all university graduates have this kind of ability. Let's discuss two nearly passive methods first. I hope that university graduates can discard their sense of status and various preconceived notions, analyze their difficult situation, and then find a solution.</p>
<p>(1) Half of the reason for not finding a job is probably due to the wrong major, which is truly unchangeable. One can only study a more socially needed subject in the short term.</p>
<p>(2) Half of the reason for not finding a job might be the lack of positions equivalent to a university degree. This is truly unchangeable. One can only take a step back and think again, and if there is nothing, take another step back.</p>
<p>I think that most university students are reluctant to accept these two points. However, I have already stated that these are solutions when there is no other way. It is best to solve the problem from the root, as mentioned earlier, before teaching and before studying.</p>
<p>The above is for university students to consider themselves. I sincerely hope that the government and social leaders can come up with a plan as soon as possible to absorb a large number of university graduates, so that they don't wander aimlessly for a long time.</p>

<p>The tigers I have seen in my life are only tigers on paper, tigers on the screen, and tigers in cages. I regret that I have not seen tigers in the mountains, and I have repeatedly wanted to draw the tiger in my heart to express my thoughts of the mountain tiger. The ancients said: (Drawing a tiger unsuccessfully, instead resembles a dog.) My tiger painting is not successful, but it looks like a cat and not a dog. Now I give up tiger paintings and write tiger poems, I wonder if it looks like a poetry cat.</p>
<p>(Look at the Tian Shan tiger, solemn and majestic. A roar shakes the heaven and earth; a raging wind chases the rain. Wild nature has not been eliminated, the forest can be self-entertained. Sleeps on the cliff of the mountain in the evening; swims on the shore of the water in the morning. Likes to listen to birds singing, all beasts dance to it. Does not harm people when full; swallows water buffalo when hungry. Once passed through Huansha Creek; does not change the Huansha girl. Returns under the bright moon. Lies facing the white clouds and speaks.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Record of Lu Haodong of the First Guangzhou Uprising <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Revive China Society, Sun Yat-sen, Chen Shaobai, Yang Quyun, Lu Haodong and others strived for the anti-Qing movement, plotting to seize Guangzhou as a base. After half a year of preparation, they launched the uprising on September 9th. This was in the year 17 before the founding of the Republic of China, the year of Yì Wèi. It was the first uprising of Premier Sun's revolution. Unfortunately, it failed. Qiu Si, Zhu Guiquan, Lu Haodong, Cheng Yaochen, and others were martyred as a result. At that time, the Governor-General of Guangdong was Tan Zhonglin (father of Tan Zuan). Considering the importance of the matter, he specially ordered the magistrates of Nanhai and Panyu counties to conduct strict interrogations, intending to use this opportunity to launch a large-scale crackdown on party members. Li Zhengyong, the magistrate of Nanhai County, brought Lu Haodong in for interrogation, using harsh words and a stern demeanor, ordering Lu to kneel. Lu refused to submit, speaking with generosity and vigor. He requested paper and pen to make a confession, and with a flourish of his pen, he wrote it in one go. His words were: "My surname is Lu, my name is Zhonggui, my alias is Haodong. I am from Cuiwei Township, Xiangshan. I am twenty-nine years old. I have been living outside and have just returned to Guangdong. Together with my fellow villager Sun Wen, I am angered by the corruption and autocracy of the foreign government, the greed and incompetence of officials, and the conspiracies and spying of foreigners. Surveying the Central Plains, it is filled with thorns. Every time I think of it, I truly do not know where my tears should come from." (Omitted) "Helplessly, greedy officials and corrupt gentry, shameless and cowardly, willingly serve the enemy, saying either that the current dynasty has deep benevolence and generous kindness, or that we are scholars who eat the dynasty's grain. How can they know that the Manchus, as a rebellious Jurchen race, entered China, seized our land, killed our ancestors, and plundered our children, women, and treasures? Consider who eats whose grain and who serves whom? The Ten Days of Yangzhou, the Three Massacres of Jiading, and the history of the two princes entering Guangdong and massacring our Han people are well known. And they call this benevolence? In short, today, unless the Qing dynasty is abolished, there is absolutely no way to restore the Han people. Unless traitors are eliminated, there is no way to destroy the Qing dynasty. Therefore, we especially want to kill one or two dog officials as a warning to our Han people. Although the matter has not succeeded, I am very gratified. My words are finished. Please execute me quickly," and so on.</p>
<p>After reading it, Li Zheng was extremely ashamed and fearful of the radical wording of Lu's confession. However, Lu refused to reveal his accomplices, so he used various illegal and cruel tortures, such as nailing and inserting into hands and feet, chiseling teeth, whipping and flogging the back, etc., all of which were exhausted. The cruelty was extreme. He fainted several times, but he firmly refused to confess and regarded death as homecoming, saying to Li: "You dog officials, even if you inflict extreme punishments on me, although my body is in pain, my heart is at peace. What can you do to me?" The next day, the American consul in Guangzhou personally visited Li, saying that Lu was a telegraph translator and not a rebel. He could guarantee it. Li showed him Lu's confession. The American consul left without a word. When Li carried out Tan's order to execute Zhu, Qiu, Lu, and Cheng, Li saw that Lu was young and handsome, and also proficient in literature, so on the day of the execution, he ordered people to dress him in a long gown.</p>
<p>In this battle, Premier Sun first went to Macau and then to Hong Kong. Shi, together with Chen Shaobai and Zheng Shiliang, crossed to Japan. Yang Quyun went to India and various parts of Africa. The rest also hid in Hong Kong and Macau, secretly plotting and striving for a resurgence. Today is the anniversary of the first Guangzhou uprising in the year of Yì Wèi, so we trace and record it.</p>

<p>An Unusual Fish in America: Professor C.H. Green of the University of Missouri claims that in 1924, several scientists discovered a peculiar fish in Monterey Bay, California. Its body is covered with hundreds of luminous scales that shimmer and glow.

<p>▲ A Duck Worth 1,000 Pounds: One thousand pounds, calculated at the current price of gold, is equivalent to over 20,000 Mexican silver dollars. To buy a small duck for such a huge sum is astounding, isn't it? However, this is a true event. It is said that this duck was displayed at an exposition in England. It is a Labrador duck. Originally, there were forty-five similar species, found on the northeastern coast of America. Seven years ago, they mysteriously disappeared and became extinct. This duck is the only surviving specimen, hence the price of 1,000 pounds. (Sea Guest)</p>
<h3 id="e176">Zhu Ziqiao, The One Who Has No Time To Warm His Seat <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao (Qinglan), a member of the National Government's Relief Committee, is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Because he has been away from his hometown for a long time, he cannot speak the Shaoxing dialect. He is very shrewd and quite incorruptible. When he was in office, his political achievements in Guangdong and other places were very good. In recent years, he has abandoned his political career and devoted himself to charitable causes. He has been to Shaanxi four times and Gansu once. His experience in disaster relief is growing day by day. Therefore, the Shanghai community initiated the Emergency Relief Association for the floods in various provinces, inviting him to serve as a standing committee member. The National Government's Flood Relief Committee invited him to serve as a member and also as the director of operations, sending telegrams to invite him to come south. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately flew to Hankou to inspect the disaster situation. After returning to Shanghai, he flew to northern Jiangsu to look down at the disaster area (bird's-eye view from the plane, without landing). On the one hand, he telegraphed experienced disaster relief workers in North China to come to Shanghai to assist him. On the other hand, he drafted an outline of disaster relief work, focusing on saving lives as a prerequisite and not stopping at saving lives, cultivating the vitality of the people, and restoring the people's ability to produce, treating both the symptoms and the root causes, and using the victims to assist in the implementation of the work, in order to arouse the people's interest in agricultural restoration. Divided into three stages: emergency relief, transition, and recovery, divided into categories and well-organized. If it can be done one by one, it will not only be a blessing for the victims, but also a blessing for the country. Zhu is currently staying at the Yipinxian Hotel on Tibet Road. He gets up very early, reviewing incoming letters and telegrams in the early morning. After ten o'clock, he goes to meetings to work or goes door-to-door to wealthy households to beg for alms, appealing for the victims. All circles admire his enthusiasm and admire his integrity. When others go to solicit donations, nine out of ten doors remain closed. When Mr. Zhu goes, people generously donate. For example, a certain lady had ten thousand yuan in foreign currency, planning to donate it to charity. She had been saving it for a long time, but hesitated because she had no one she trusted. Recently, she heard that Mr. Zhu had come to Shanghai, so she personally sent it to him. His prestige is so moving. He usually advocates vegetarianism, so when Shanghai friends invite him to dinner, it is either at the Jue Lin or the Gongde Lin restaurant. After being seated, he orders a dish or two, then urges the rice to come. His appetite is quite good, able to eat four or five small bowls. Sometimes he drafts telegrams at the banquet. He is nearly sixty years old, full of energy, and has a strong interest in conversation. When he is free in the evening, relatives and friends visit him, and he talks about the past, tirelessly, not leaving until midnight. His hair is already gray, but he has not yet shaved it. When he sees people of his age with beards, such as Wen Lan Ting, Ha Shao Fu, Gu Yanqing, and Xu Shiying, he says (you are a senior, I am a young man). He is physically strong and of great stature. Although he has lived outside the pass for a long time, he does not wear fur in winter. Young people sigh that they are not as good. When lecturing at the conference, he gesticulates with his hands, full of vigor. When he speaks most vigorously, his eyelids open and close non-stop. After inspecting the disaster situation in Hankou and northern Jiangsu, he shook his head whenever he talked about the disaster situation, saying, "It's terrible." Whenever he meets a kind person who donates money for relief, he praises their good deeds, calling them "amazing." Because his colleagues saw that he was a general with a bodhisattva's heart, they all called him the Bodhisattva General. Recently, because he often inspects the disaster situation by plane, he is now also called the Flying General.</p>

<p>— (Yin Shouman)</p>
<p>In recent years, various stores have used advertisements of "unprecedented price cuts" to attract customers. Some say that this is actually an ominous phrase, because its homophone is "universal waste and great embarrassment." Now that a great flood has caused disaster, covering seventeen provinces, with more than fifty million refugees, it is a rare disaster in history. This saying has unfortunately come true. After mourning, I can only be dumbfounded.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Records of Sights and Sounds of the Old Capital <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuan An</p>
<p>Fengtai Peonies</p>
<p>Today, Fengtai is where the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining railways intersect. It is the first large station entering Beiping. The south gate of the Jin capital was called Fengyi. The city was abandoned, but the gate site still remains, hence the current name. Every time a train passes through here, if it is during the flowering season, there will be people holding full-bloomed peonies for sale. The red and purple colors are dazzling, making people forget the fatigue of the journey. In the past, the residents of Fengtai all made flower cultivation their business. Continuous irrigation ditches and fields were planted with nothing else. The needs of the inner court and noble families for hair ornaments were so extravagant. The Tang poem says, "Recently, there is no way to deal with the peony. Tens of thousands of coins buy a single clump." The remaining style and charm still exist. Mao Xihe's concubine was named Tiantian, and she was the daughter of a flower seller from this place. She absorbed the wind and drank the dew, and her skin was as fair as a goddess. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, there were still refined scholars who set up wine here. Wang Renfu's Xiangqilou poetry notes say, "Every year during the flowering season, ten gold pieces must be reserved for one day to prevent them from being cut off, so that they can be appreciated." At that time, it was already considered extravagant. Now, the altars of the soil and grain and the gardens are very prosperous, surrounded by short fences. Walking around for a week, the fragrance fills the sleeves. Few tourists come to Fengtai anymore. The gardening skills of Beiping are the best among the cities. It is difficult to name all the famous flowers and exotic species. What is particularly suitable for the temperament of scholars is the crabapple, in addition to peonies. Generally, families with slightly wider courtyards have two trees. The Zheshuigong Jiangxuexuan, the Nanhai Yinian Hall, and the Yihe Garden Leshou Hall have the most luxuriant plants. My old house in Changsha City had two trees, which were very tall and straight, nearly a hundred years old. They were transplanted from the northern capital by a Manchu named Yu. The firewood and wood were destroyed, and the sacred objects withered. When I moved my family to Beiping, there were also two clumps in the front and back courtyards, one red and one white. Every year, they alternate in prosperity and decline. The white one has twisted branches and casts shade all over the courtyard. Even in Beiping, it is rare. Next are the purple and white lilacs, which grow in clumps, not choosing the location, and bloom before and after the crabapples. The calyxes are small and fragrant. Inserting them in a vase is both elegant and beautiful. Compared to the violets of Europe and America, why are they not as good? Further down are pomegranates and oleanders. These two plants bloom and bear fruit continuously from late spring to mid-autumn. Arranged in the courtyard, they add to the richness. This is also a custom of the old capital. Good people jokingly use two sentences to summarize the situation of Manchu residences: "Awning, fish tank, pomegranate tree, first fatten the dog, then grow the head." The meaning is that the courtyard must have an awning, the door must have a tank to store goldfish, and pomegranates must be decorated in between. "First the dog, then the head" refers to the fact that the owner of the house must first raise a dog and then become an official. Rich and wealthy officials have no elegant bones at all. The arrangement of their homes is gaudy and vulgar, as if vividly seen. Although it is said to be a joke and close to abuse, it cannot be said by those who are not good at understanding things. Every year, as the New Year approaches, the East and West Temple Markets compete to sell Tang flowers, peonies and peach blossoms, planted in pots and basins to reflect the pepper plates, adding color. Cutting paper with scissors seems clumsy. Southern specialties, such as tangerines, pomelos, heavenly candles, jasmine, and Jianlan orchids, are very expensive. If the cultivation is not careful, they will not survive. Almost only wealthy families can grow them. However, those who cultivate them never give up. As for the lotus flowers of Taiye Lake, the colors are the most brilliant. Traveling by car on the Jin'ao and Yudong bridges, in the early sun and cool evening, people enjoy them to their hearts' content. It is not necessary to keep them in the pond. This is something that the south cannot catch up with. Good people like to hold chrysanthemum meetings in the autumn, showing off new and unusual varieties. The five colors are constantly changing. I dislike the fact that it turns elegance into vulgarity, slightly losing the true, leisurely, and natural flavor of Dongli. The same is true of plums in winter. The craftsmen who cultivate plums are difficult to cure of their vulgar bones, and they like to bend the plum branches to fit the model, completely ignoring their horizontal and oblique state. I believe that Beiping's horticulture has a hopeful development, and the livelihood of the citizens depends on it a lot. The municipal authorities should encourage what has already been achieved and guide what is lacking. Everything that is clearly contrary to science and art should be discouraged. The beauty of the four seasons has been described in detail. There is still one thing that I forgot to mention, which is what is commonly called the elm-leaf plum. Its flowers combine the beauty of peach blossoms and crabapples, and it is very easy to grow. It is the "hua e bu ye" of the Tang poem, which is rare in other places, but abundant in the old capital.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>She never quarreled with her husband, and she never told others her husband's shortcomings completely, so even though she had received such a great stimulus, she still refused to tell Mr. and Mrs. Chen about the woman in the car. She only wept sadly. However, Mr. and Mrs. Chen knew that she was like this because of her husband, but they couldn't say anything in front of Mr. Li.</p>
<p>Mr. Li was very angry in his heart at his wife's narrow-mindedness; at the same time, he complained that Mr. and Mrs. Chen lived in the same house, how could they let her go out in the wind and snow, causing this incident. He thought that no one knew about all his behavior outside, and his wife was naturally kept in the dark, but now he was very worried and very afraid, because his wife had seen through his secret, and he dared not say anything, only quietly smoked cigarettes, sitting on the sofa, waiting for changes, just like enemy troops observing each other's movements, in order to resist. He was considering what kind of strategy to deal with if his wife announced this secret in front of many people. After the police took the thug away, he was a little relieved; Mrs. Li didn't speak, and he was a little relieved again.</p>
<p>"When did she go out? We didn't hear it; the wind and snow outside are so heavy, where did she fall?" Mr. Chen was the first to break the silence in the house and asked, almost starting to attack Mr. Li.</p>
<p>"Today, because the company was checking an account, I didn't finish until two thirty. I hurriedly hired a car to come back, but I didn't expect to see her fall in the snow as soon as I got out of the car. Lan Zhen, why are you so mindless, running out in the middle of the night? You are so silly! I'm not a child, how could I be abducted?" Mr. Li replied to Mr. Chen, and then complained about his wife. Mrs. Li was already very angry in her heart. After hearing her husband's words, she wanted to announce what she had seen, but after a change of mind, she immediately changed her strategy. She felt that if she announced it now, he would definitely be ashamed and angry, and the relationship between the husband and wife might immediately break down and become irreparable. It was better to endure it and make him discover his conscience, realize and turn back. But she was even more depressed and cried so much that she couldn't breathe. Mr. Li wanted to use a gentle method to pretend to comfort his wife; but because he was used to putting on a husband's air, he was suddenly embarrassed to be tender with his wife in front of so many people, so he continued to smoke his cigarettes.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Gold Standard Continues to Rise Slightly <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fluctuations Are Peaceful: Yesterday, the 8th, the gold standard continued to rise slightly in a peaceful state. The front and back markets fluctuated by only five liang, resulting in a rise of two liang or so. Each company generally saw demand exceeding supply, and the market sentiment turned from weak to firm. The morning seemed to be weak, and once broke through 770 liang, because the London silver bars reported a rise, especially the European market was strong, and buyers were active. After that, the exchange rate was peaceful, but the banks were still able to eat in, and there were always large buyers on the table, so the price rose again by three or four liang, but there was a slight accumulation. The after-market was very stable, hovering outside 74 liang. The large bars may see a slight drop this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Early Morning Weakness: The opening price of the October contract in the morning fell by one liang and one qian, at 770 liang and 0.05 qian. The recent long bars were one-sixteenth, and the far-term changed suddenly. There was no market for silver prices, and there was no telegram from the US stock market. Tongtaichang and Hengxing all sold. Then, from 70 liang and 0.08 qian, it finally fell to 69 liang and 0.07 qian. However, Wupin TaoTou and Shunli Wanxing all bought in, and immediately rose by three liang, to 72 liang and 0.06 qian.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market situation for each month still trended towards a weak and tired state. This is because the bullish side seems to have been discouraged since the government decided to use foreign wheat for disaster relief and cannot raise prices. In addition, the sales of Russian wheat are still frequently inquired about, and it seems that one wave has not subsided, and another wave is rising. Surplus food from abroad is fiercely entering China, so most people's hearts are dim. After observing the future steps, it should show a long-term tired and short-term smart situation. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen compared to the previous day, October and November fell by 1 fen, December fell by 1 fen and 2 li, and January and February fell by 7 li and 5 hao.</p>

This is because although there are no quotations for foreign wheat, the hearts of the inland merchants are that the chips in the market are expanding like this, and in addition, the sales of Russian wheat are rampant in the market with rumors that they only need between 3 Liang, 6 Qian, and 7 Qian. Although the goods are inferior to European and American wheat, they are much higher than Chinese wheat, so people's hearts continue to soften, and future steps are still difficult to reset. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, October fell by 3 fen, November fell by 2 fen, December fell by 1 fen, January fell by 2 fen, and February improved by 1 fen. Spot wheat saw quiet transactions and no business was done.</p>

<p>Each Mound Rises by Another 2 Qian</p>
<p>The Five Fortune White Crystal Sugar Xiamen Factory has been cooking for many days, but because it cannot be dried due to rain, it could not be transported to Shanghai in the early stage. Yesterday, the Jinan Ship of Taikoo Company finally transported a batch of more than 100 boxes. Upon hearing the news, various firms rushed to buy them, resulting in the price of each mound rising by another 2 Qian. It opened at 9 Liang and 4 Qian, which was not enough to distribute. The firmness surpassed Heng. Dongxian's Xitaiyuan Sand has been in short supply for a long time, and the upper grade is lacking. Although other brands of goods have declined, they are not liked by customers and are difficult to price.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port still trended towards quiet tiredness. This is because the New York market was affected by economic instability, and the price of silk was reported to have fallen. The telegram transfer was stagnant, and the European firm sales stomach was also good. Yesterday, only Lanye Bi and others bought 70 bales of Shanghai White Factory Handled Silk, and Dada and others bought 20 bales of White Dry Handled Silk. The price was still stable.</p>

<p>European and American Silk Telegrams Are Not Transferred... Prices Fall by 4 to 5 Lire</p>
<p>The Rice Cocoon Market, Recently, the Italian silk market has turned tired and stagnant. This is because silk sales in New York have stopped again. British and French silk telegrams are also rarely transferred, and silk prices have been reported to have fallen. On Monday, the price of each kilo of Double Special Grade was only 391 lire, Special Grade was 343 lire, and Superior Grade was 287 lire, each falling by 4 to 5 lire.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the needle eyebrow green tea from Lailu Zhuang, British firms such as Yihua, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu, etc., showed increasing interest, and the entire city traded more than 1,000 boxes. The top board opened to 82 Liang, which was 3 to 4 Liang higher than before. The market for Zhenmei and Gongxi items was also quite firm, but transactions were slightly quieter than before.

<p>Hardware transactions are extremely deserted because customer sales are stagnant and tired. The market conditions in each city are also almost unremarkable. However, because there is less stock of No. 16 to No. 20 new lead wire, the price rose by 2.5 Qian yesterday, estimated at 13 Liang and 2.5 Qian per dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 was 18 Liang and 7 Qian and 5 Fen. It is heard that more than 600 to 700 dan were offered, but the inventory is becoming more and more scarce, and people's hearts are more determined.

<h3 id="e219">The Trend of Automobile Progress <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>Since the invention of the automobile, only a few decades have passed, yet it has swept the globe, serving humanity and being regarded as the only convenient means of transportation in modern times. Moreover, automobile manufacturers and renowned mechanical inventors in Europe and America have spared no effort in meticulously researching to make the application of automobiles perfect. Therefore, since the first automobile came into the world, the various reforms and advancements in the past few decades are too numerous to mention. The motivations behind these can be roughly summarized into three aspects: 1. Striving for precision in the mechanical aspect, to increase efficiency during use, add speed, and ensure stable operation. This is the most important aspect. 2. Achieving mass production to reduce costs, lower prices, and facilitate widespread sales for broad distribution. 3. Changing various styles and colors to meet the needs of society and achieve aesthetic appeal. While these three aspects may not encompass all the reasons for the progress of automobiles, they are the most significant and are not far from the truth.</p>
<p>In terms of modern commercial trends, the first question after a product is created is how to sell it as much as possible. However, to achieve high sales, it must start with needs. For example, after an automobile is manufactured, if the public has no need for it, then there is no doubt that the automobile cannot be sold. On the other hand, the purchasing public may not yet know what they need, which is also a common phenomenon. However, while what is needed may not be clear, what is not needed is well-known and self-evident without explanation. Let's take an example to prove that this statement is not wrong. Suppose a certain automobile factory manufactures a new car where the engine start and brakes are all controlled by a single button, which is convenient and unprecedented. This innovation is certainly needed by the public, but before this car is launched, the public may not have had such a need. This is not accidental. Conversely, if there is another automobile with a bulky body and slow movement, then the purchasing public will retreat without even asking about it. Why? Because it is not needed.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the production volume of automobiles was not as high as in recent years. The colors of the car bodies were extremely monotonous, with only one color. The commonly used color was black, which was simple, dull, and lacked liveliness. However, car users at that time were accustomed to it and did not feel uncomfortable. The reason for this was probably that the speed and stability of automobiles at that time had not yet reached a perfect state. There were many aspects of the machinery that needed innovation and research, so the aesthetics of car body colors were not yet a priority. Today, with many improvements and innovations in the mechanical aspects, the public's need for beautifying automobiles is evident. Therefore, the colors of car bodies are coordinated and adjusted to strive for beauty, lightness, elegance, and vibrancy. If you visit various car factories, you will find that the new cars they produce mostly have various colors, allowing customers to choose. They can also customize the color according to the customer's preferences. The progress of automobiles has reached maturity.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the cylinder issue of the automobile itself. In the past, automobiles mostly had four cylinders. Later, due to the public's need for speed and stability, six-cylinder automobiles emerged. Today, in addition to six cylinders, eight cylinders or even more are needed. The cylinders have a great relationship with the automobile's operation. When car factories switched from four-cylinder cars to six-cylinder cars, they spent tens of millions of dollars to renovate factories and machinery. Now, if they want to upgrade from six cylinders to eight cylinders, the amount of money spent will be even greater. In summary, although this kind of improvement is in response to the trend of the times, the main point is still due to the eager demand of the purchasers. As there are many cars produced by each factory and the competition is fierce, they do not hesitate to spend tens of millions of dollars to solve these pressing problems.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of the automobile's selling price. Once a car is made, it must be sold to the buyer. How to attract the attention of customers and achieve the purpose of sales is also worth studying. Various additional expenses will also arise. Therefore, in addition to the cost of the car body, a certain amount of sales expenses must be added. As for the various uses of the factory, these are necessary expenses. Even if the car is not sold, these expenses continue to arise and cannot be stopped, just as a cow needs fodder even if it is not plowing. Based on the above reasons, the issue of the automobile's selling price is a crucial matter for each car factory. In the past, when production was low and labor was expensive, the selling price was very high compared to now. Today, most factories adopt the policy of mass production and strive to reduce labor costs while increasing productivity. Therefore, the quality of the goods is better than before, while the price has fallen.</p>

<h3 id="e221">An Ideal Automobile <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tiyun</p>
<p>Several years ago, a wealthy young man, Mr. A, visited the studio of a famous American car body designer and requested the creation of an ideal automobile.</p>
<p>Mr. A said: (I deeply understand the need for a car. But how to design this car, I am a layman. In short, on sunny days, I will lower the convertible top to make it a sports car and fully enjoy the natural scenery. But when necessary, the convertible top can transform it into a sedan. Normally, it only provides seating for two people, but occasionally, if there are two more people, it should not affect the comfort of each person. The appearance should be as rich as possible while also expressing an air of dignity. Whether on broad avenues, tree-lined roads, fast driving, or slow driving, each should be extremely suitable. This is my ideal automobile.) The designer pondered for a moment and smiled, saying: (I have also thought like this. Perhaps it can be realized in the future to meet your needs.)</p>
<p>Now, this ideal automobile has become a reality. It is the Studebaker Free-Wheeling President Eight-Cylinder Four-Season Roadster.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Tong-Yu Route Selected <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Lang</p>
<p>The Tong-Yu Road is the main land transportation artery between Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. After repeated consultations between the two sides, the Sichuan authorities favored Wen-shui as the connecting point, and some people in Guizhou also agreed. However, the Wen-shui route is only slightly flat in Sichuan, while in Guizhou, large mountains span across it, making it unsuitable for use as a provincial road. The Guizhou authorities specifically ordered Dou Shanxiang, the director of the Tong-Yu Highway Survey Team, to personally visit the Sichuan authorities to discuss changing the connecting point and conducting a joint survey. This was approved, and the Chongqing Survey Team sent Chief Engineer Shen and others to Songkan to conduct a joint on-site survey. As a result, the Xin-Song route was adopted, with Chong-xi-gou as the Sichuan-Guizhou connecting point. Now, Mr. Dou has returned to the province after completing his mission and published a comparative description of the Xin-Song route selection reasons and the engineering of each route. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>The Tong-Yu Avenue originally passed through Xin-Song. The mountains are high and the terrain is extremely dangerous. Anyone who has passed through knows that the road is impassable. Before the team conducted the survey, it was expected that this section of the road must bypass Wen-shui. Therefore, upon reaching Tongzi, the team split up and conducted on-site inspections. One route went from Tongzi via Jiuba, Zhangyangba, Wenshui, and Shihao to Ganshui. Another route went from Tongzi via Maotian, Chumipu, Luoyangxi, Liangfengya, Huabeiping, Tianshuichi, Shanpo, Xinzhan, Songkan, Jiudianya, and Guanyinqiao to Ganshui. Another route exited Luoxigou and went via Yejiba, YanYan, Xiaojiupan to Ganshui. Yet another route went out of Maliu, Yangcun, Anhe, Huaqiutang, and down to Xinzhan, then followed the river out of Songkan Fishing Cave to Ganshui. In addition, several comparative lines were surveyed near difficult sections such as Chaomipu, Dapo, and XiongHuangsi Bazhuaxi on the Xin-Song line. After several months of time, the results of the survey of each route showed that the old Xin-Song road was indeed difficult to build. However, there are good routes near the old road. Whether compared in terms of route length, slope, engineering, economics, or the prosperity of towns along the way, it is superior to other routes. After the Chongqing Survey Team conducted an on-site survey, they also changed their proposal to use Wen-shui as the connecting point and expressed their agreement. After the Xin-Song road was selected, some people were not surprised but suspicious, and some even raised objections. Now, I will compare the advantages and disadvantages of each surveyed route and explain the situation obtained to dispel the doubts of the general public.</p>
<p>(1) Xin-Song Route: This line starts from the edge of the North Gate of Tong City, passes through Maotian, Shuimotang, Sanzuosi, Chumipu, Luoyangxi, Liangfengya, Niugundang, Huaqiuping, Jiaoshan, Tianshuichi, Yingzuiyan, Tudiping, Dawoodang, Changziyan, Liujiashan, Tunyan, Damaopo, Shanpo, Xinzhan, Mengdu, Caoxieya, Jiulonggou, Banpo, Qinggangshao, Guankou, Qizhenxi, Chenghuangsi, Sangyuanba, Liangfengya, Qingshui Creek, Dabao Pu, Songkan Fenwan, Ma'anshan, Bazhuaxi, Guanyinyan, Hanjiaodian, Yantoushang, Baiyangping, Jiudianya, Damianpo, and reaches Chongxigou, connecting to the Sichuan border. The total length is 160 li. The route is straight. From Tong City to Chumipu, it is 20 li and completely flat. The earth and rock mountain is no more than ten feet high, and the bridges are only three or four small bridges a few feet wide. From Chumipu, it slopes up to Huaqiuping, and then slopes to reach Shanpo for more than 40 li. It can avoid the extremely large Yan Mountain of Zushi Guan Shi Niu Lan, and the slope is long and gentle. Sharp bends are also very rare. Furthermore, 80 to 90 percent of the area is pure soil. The rock mountain route is only about one-tenth. From Shanpo via Xinzhan to Mengdu, it is 20 li and the route is flat. There is less rock and more soil. The rock mountain section is only four or five li. The entire section is sandy, making it extremely easy to excavate. Furthermore, the existing Mengdu Bridge can be used, reducing tens of thousands of bridge construction costs. From Mengdu, it slopes up to Caoxieya, then passes smoothly along the hillside to reach Qinggangshao. Then, it descends slowly to Qizhenxi for 20 li. The dangers of the Jiulong Three Valleys are transformed into a flat, gentle slope. Moreover, most of it is mud, and the rock is sandy, making the work extremely easy. The section from Qizhenxi directly to Songkan is about 30 li and is also flat. There is even more farmland. The rock mountain sections are only at Chenghuangsi, Liangfengya, Qingshui Creek, and Waiyanzi, where each rock is no more than 40 feet long and is sandy, requiring little effort. From Songkan, it slopes up to Jiudianya, then descends to Chongxigou, which is 8 li. Although it is a sloping route, the slope is gentle, and sharp bends are also very rare. The soil mountain route accounts for about 80 percent. The rock mountain section is only at Ma'anshan, Bazhuaxi, Guanyinyan, and the top of Yantou, totaling no more than four or five li. Digging a zhang-wide rock and building a few-foot-high embankment roadbed can be quickly completed. This is the most significant project of the entire line. However, it will only cost tens of thousands of dollars, which is not much. In summary, the rock mountain route is only about one-tenth of the entire line, while the soil mountain route accounts for nine-tenths. The laborers find it easier to work, and success is naturally easier. More than ten li of rock mountains only require about 110,000 yuan. However, there are slightly more embankments, requiring about 130,000 yuan. As for bridges, there are only more than 40, requiring about 70,000 yuan. The total is only more than 300,000 yuan. Therefore, this line is not only straight and saves on construction costs for both provinces, but also has dense towns along the way, making it easier to develop than other lines. Even if the Sichuan border is temporarily impassable, we only need to repair to Songkan to connect with the waterway and obtain the convenience of water and land transportation. Compared to other lines, it has many advantages. Therefore, the Xin-Song line is indeed worth adopting.</p>
<p>(2) Comparison with the Wenshui Line: This line starts from Tongzi Guandu River, follows the Tong-Chi-Ma Road route, passes through Yangliuping, Jiuba, Zhangyangba, and reaches Wenshui. Then, it branches off from Wenshui and passes through Shihao to reach Ganshui. Most of the Tong-Wen section has been excavated. Only 30 li need to be newly built from Wenshui to connect to the Sichuan border. Before the survey, the Sichuan and Guizhou authorities and the surveyors on both sides expected that the Tong-Yu route would definitely pass through here. The Sichuan side even made a decision to use Wenshui as the border point. However, the survey results showed that this line is 120-130 li longer than the Xin-Song line, with each station being longer in Sichuan and Guizhou. Moreover, the route is poor. Although it is slightly flat in Sichuan, the Guizhou section, except for the section from Zhangyangba via Wenshui to the Sichuan border, is slightly flat, but the 100 li from Zhangyangba to Tongzi are all mountains and ridges spanning across it. The route has large undulations and many sharp bends. Furthermore, the slope is large, exceeding 10 percent in many places, making it unsuitable for use as a provincial road. It is not as straight as the Xin-Song line and has fewer curves. Even in terms of engineering, although more than half of the earthwork has been completed, there are still bare slopes that have not been worked on at all. Furthermore, after years of erosion by rainwater, it is feared that no more than half of the project has been completed. The old road of 200 li between Tong-Wen has human paths, but only two stations of the road, and the repair of the curves really have more than three stations. The new construction engineering of 30 li outside of Wenshui, totaling nearly the whole new construction engineering of Xin-Song's whole line, and the special engineering of the bridges, culverts, rock dikes, etc., has not even started. According to the estimate of the Chief of the Guichi Road Engineering, the Tongzi county's special engineering expenses will cost 290,000. Shuishui county's expenses will cost more than 700,000. According to this, the least amount it will cost from the Tongzi region to Wenshui will be 300,000. If one adds Wenshui to the Sichuan region, it will also take four or five thousand. The total special engineering expenses required will be about 600,000, which is double the 300,000 of the Xin-Song line. It is not known if it is worthwhile or not. Even if the Wen line is completed, vehicles are more expensive to transport. Neither time nor wealth is economical. The transport and local development along the way would not have any great prospects. The Guizhou-Yu Line not being here, but by Xin Song, has great reasons to exist. (To be continued.)</p>

<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Therefore, if our army does not give the enemy enough time to reorganize their ranks, the enemy forces will surely be in a chaotic state, and our offensive can advance like a sharp knife cleaving bamboo.</p>
<p>The enemy's numerous machine guns firing simultaneously are indeed sufficient to slow down our covering retreat, but are not enough to constitute a strong defense.</p>
<p>Given the situation, our army often has to find ways to break through the enemy's lines. Our infantry and artillery units must designate targets sufficient to break the enemy's lines for the attack.</p>
<p>The following points are quite important:</p>
<p>(A) Corps should identify the most important distant targets.</p>
<p>(B) Divisional units should select intermediate targets.</p>
<p>(C) Regiment and battalion troops should launch accurate, swift, and fierce attacks on enemy machine gun nests that are hindering our advance.</p>
<p>The future development of the battle hinges on the efforts of the corps commander and division commanders, as well as the soldiers' lives.</p>
<p>On September 26th, after a fierce artillery bombardment, the U.S. First Army and the French Fourth Army followed suit at 5:30 a.m. and 5:25 a.m., respectively, and separately began the (B)(C) offensive. The entire attacking force immediately progressed between the Meuse River and the Suippe River, occupying the enemy's first line of defense, with an average advance of two to three miles.</p>
<p>In order to closely follow the development of the battle, I moved to the Villa Teleriafontaine on the afternoon of the 26th (north of Saint-Dizier). I also stayed there on the 27th. During the day, I visited Commander Pétain in Nadon Valley and also went to the headquarters of General Gérard Chrétien-Jean Lelong Saint-Maur.</p>
<p>On the 27th and 28th, the enemy resisted stubbornly. The French Fourth Army was stalemated on the German lines in the Py River basin. The U.S. First Army, after being suddenly attacked from the Argonne side, stopped around Apremont.</p>
<p>On September 29th, the French Fourth Army concentrated its forces in the middle and launched a fierce attack, breaking through the Py River line and driving the enemy back to the second line between the Chiers River, the Py River, and Montfaucon-d'Argonne. However, the U.S. Army was trapped between the Meuse River and the Argonne River, where the terrain was very narrow, and it was difficult to march due to the mountains and rivers. The enemy's flank attacks from the Argonne side and the east bank of the Meuse River were still insurmountable. The U.S. Army wanted to increase the strength of the first line to overcome these difficulties, but not only was it futile, but the coordination between the front and rear of the army was also ineffective, and all lines of communication were cut off.</p>
<p>In order to remedy the situation, I agreed with Commander Pétain and decided to withdraw several divisions from the U.S. front line, some to the east of the Meuse River, and some to the west of the Argonne River, and advocated incorporating them into the French corps on the front line to avoid wasting time. The French and American troops on both banks of the Meuse River were under the command of General Pershing, and another French general (Second Army) was appointed to command the Allied forces on both banks of the Argonne River.

<p>Before 1492, no civilized country in the universe even dreamed of having such a thing as cigarettes. The originator of smoking can be said to be the Red Indian of America. They rolled tobacco leaves into long shapes and put them in pipes, and then smoked. Our current paper-rolled cigarettes are just a later variation.</p>
<p>There are many places in the world that produce tobacco leaves, such as Canada, India, Egypt, and Turkey. Our country also has tobacco leaves in Xuchang and Qingzhou. However, the place with the largest production and the best tobacco leaves in the world is in Virginia in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The total number of cigarettes consumed worldwide is unknown because there has not been a detailed survey, so accurate reports are impossible to obtain. However, in the United States alone, 115,000,000,000 cigarettes are consumed each year, invisibly spending more than $1,500,000,000. It sells 1,000,000,000 cigarettes in its British Strait Settlements, 250,000,000 cigarettes in Burma, and 1,000,000,000 cigarettes in the Philippine Islands. As for China, even more are imported, totaling 38,500,000,000 cigarettes. In summary, the total number of cigarettes consumed in various parts of the world is not as much as in the Far East countries.</p>

<p>▲Aishi Pharmacy claims that its secret family-made surgical medicine, Huanji Cream, specializes in treating all kinds of sores, damaged hands and feet, unnamed carbuncles, scabies, scalds, cuts, bruises, and carbuncles. When encountering the above symptoms, applying the cream will immediately stop the pain and itching, draw out toxins, reduce swelling, remove decay, and promote new tissue growth. It has always been praised by people from all walks of life. Recently, the weather has been hot, and sores are rampant, making the cream very popular. It is sold in Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, and major company pharmacies and shops.</p>
<p>▲Datongsheng Chinese Medicine Store, located at the southern end of Rue Chaleux in the French Concession, claims that it was established by wealthy merchant Xu Jianshan. After preparing for several months in a newly built three-story Western-style building, it recently opened. The first day's business reached as high as seven or eight thousand yuan, and has continued at around a thousand yuan per day. The store personally procures ginseng, bird's nest, and deer antlers, and carefully supervises the production of pills, powders, and decoctions, which customers are extremely satisfied with. The other night, the store held a banquet for guests and friends at the Doyichu Sichuan Restaurant. Despite the stormy weather, attendance was very enthusiastic. Lu Hanjun and others provided courteous hospitality, making it a grand occasion. During the banquet, famous doctors Yang Zhitian and Yin Yifu successively spoke, painfully recounting the decline of the national essence and the harm of the outflow of rights and interests, moving all those who listened. The guests and hosts dispersed happily until late at night. Furthermore, in view of the recent widespread flooding, the store, feeling heartbroken, initiated a proposal by Manager Xu Zheng to automatically donate one day's income within the next few days, along with its own donations, to relief organizations for distribution to the disaster areas, to do its part.</p>
