<p>日本仍堅持自由勦匪權</p>
<p>起草會與中日代表晤商</p>
<p>要求芳澤作公開的解釋</p>
<p>有人建議决議案附日本宣言</p>
<p>（巴黎）中國總代表施肇基之辭職雖未得南京政府之批准然理事會之工作不無稍受影響惟會議則仍照常進行理事會之起草委員會今日上午曾集議一次下午理事會復有會議除中日代表外十二理事俱出席並定於星期日下午三時三十分由起草委員會與中代表施氏及日代表澤晤談有所會商據聞理事會對於錦州附近設立中立區域問題頗有堅决之主張理事會并已通告日言謂倘芳澤能於下次全體大會開會時發表宣言對於勦匪事項加以解釋並允許其他各代表加以公開之批評者則理事會會長白里安所擬定之宣言中關於勦匪事件之一節亦可取銷故理事會現正力求渡過一重難關對於施肇基辭職之說當然不與置信因施氏倘辭職者不啻表示中國放棄對於國聯之請求也理事會今日下午四時開秘密會議討論日本對於滿洲事件解决方案之修正文及考慮起草委員會之報告嗣於五時三十分散會靜待星期日下午三時半理事會起草委員會與中日雙方代表會商之結局再定此後之步驟同時中日雙方代表已收到其本國政府對於理事會决議案之覆文均呈戟</p>
<p>交理事會雙方對於中立區域之設施俱有所陳述而此點亦即理事會討論滿洲問題以來最難處置之問題也現日方仍堅持對於滿洲區内之警權有自由處置之必要而理事會則覺視察團員應常駐滿境監視日本之撤兵及日軍對於匪類及一切不法份子攻擊之狀態再則數年以前尼瓜拉圭國與美國軍隊共同出兵征討叛徒桑丁諾將軍之前例亦應可用作借鏡也日代表團法律顧問伊籐今晨十一時曾與起草委員會會商兩小時半之久</p>
<p>伊籐已將理事會决議案第五條之修正文及白里安宣言之修正文電達東京（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日午後四時行政會集議中日代表皆未出席聽取起草委員會關於今晨與伊籐晤談之報告並贊成該委會會所擬之辦法五時一刻散會聞已决定對於日本之意見與議案第五段文字有關者予以滿意至於勦匪與中立區域問題皆未解决起草委員會定六日午後三時半與施博士晤談後再接見伊籐（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）消息靈通之中國某要人頃向本社聲言稱施顧二氏辭職足見情勢嚴重而難關有不易過渡之感數日之前中國代表團曾提議錦州中國軍隊可以撤退但以日本承諾不向錦州前進爲條件迄至此際日本代表團乃在華北保留有隨時干涉之權并謂何時出予干涉當由日本自定之抑中國軍隊之撤退須以中立國觀察員到達錦州并實行工作爲條件日本仍又反對之在此情形之下中國代表團對於提議之件自必認爲失效中國輿論對於巴黎磋商事件至爲感慨以爲國聯會任務端在阻止並懲罰一切侵略行爲中國若在其領土一部份無條件將其軍隊撤退則中國旣爲受害人又自居於從犯之列是烏乎可中國輿論寗得一與十月二十四日議决案相類似之解决方案該决議案雖未實行而在精神上猶認中國爲有理由反之其他一切議决案若附有撤退中國軍隊之條文皆足使中國在精神上失敗而承認日本在中國有永久干涉之權利云云以上各項問題即使顧氏安於其位仍依然存在故國聯會工作情形因上項驚人消息轉成爲次要昨日中國提出備忘錄業由行政院加以考慮今晨伊藤復遞送意見書行政院忙碌實甚至施肇基提出之備忘錄共計十欵大要如下</p>
<p>施氏反對中立區域延長至長城設立中立區域之議倡自三大國兹旣不能向日本取獲不再在滿洲前進之保證則中國軍隊撤退問題無復成立之餘地且日兵已向鐵路撤退則在錦州與鐵路之中間已有中立區域而予行政院以保證俾敵對行動不致重行發生要在日軍不向前進展日本亦旣允之至於中國自始即採取和平方式業已證明如此而欲中國軍隊退出錦州可稱爲無的放矢但各大國若願遣派國際軍隊用以維持治安則中國亦可承受倘日軍若再向長城前進則中國將採取正當防衛所必需之行動特於此保留之施氏備忘錄結稱華軍退出本國領土一事他人未便相强云云本日特徵厥惟中國態度突變强硬起草委員會明日開會其任務自感困難（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）起草委員會定今日午後開會將與伊藤商榷議案修正事其中有兩點距解决不遠昨晚伊藤見薛西爾對於議案第五段與調查委員團職權有關者之文字建議修正規定撤兵問題决不依調查委員團職務爲轉移伊藤與薛西爾以爲此種修正可爲日本與行政會所接受如東京以此爲然則今日午後當可解决北寗線日軍又大活動施肇基在巴黎被毆傷眼北平東車站被學生佔據不能開車日方消息本莊繁催促張學良撤退錦州駐軍（見國内要電）德國否認停付私債英法經濟談判未成（見國外要電）市民聯合會昨開成立大會（見本埠新聞）</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>此問題有人提出一種巧妙建議旣可避免行政會若干會員之反對承認日本有自由勦匪權又可使日本滿意此項建議主張議案中與導言中皆不言及勦匪事但日代表得發表宣言保留於需要時勦匪行動之權行政會可紀錄此種宣言而不作正式投票惟上述建議現尚未經日本接受今日午後將討論如何提出此項建議之形式至於應否商諸中國微其同意則尚未决定故此難題尚未知何時能解决也（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本現似可接受國聯議案因提交日本覆議者現僅有兩點而此兩點皆可整理也第一點爲調查團之職權範圍確悉國聯於此已承認日本立塲但請日本另提出方案第二點爲用武力治匪事大約國聯準備承認聽令日本自由剿匪之必要但不欲明明准許用武力也聞國聯因此理由已請芳澤對於此事另作保留而勿堅持在議案本文中或議長宣言中列入此點衆料日本可贊成此議祗須中國不得提出取銷日本保留對案耳（六日路透社電）</p>

<p>丨工部局情報處發表丨</p>
<p>注重民族間仇視之一點</p>
<p>工部局情報處昨日發表消息一則如下、</p>
<p>公共租界内之華人私立學校、應盡量使之與羣界各校辦法一致、此乃工部局之期望、界内非工部局設立之華童學校、幾全由華人自行管理、除因租界之特殊情形外、絶未受何限制、依照中國法律、其管轄之權實在上海市敎育局、以上兩點、皆爲工部局所承認者、因此工部局已向上海市長提議、擬由局方接受敎育局之推薦、以示私立學校有得補助費之資格、如果敎育局担負此項責任、丨甚望該局肯爲担任、丨則此項補助費之分配及發給、自當由工部局會同敎育局、根據工部局敎育委員會之華人委員分會之報告、及最近批准之章程辦理之此項章程名爲「華人學校之普通條件」其内容與工部局所定關於私立之外籍兒童學校者相同、惟二者之施行區域有異耳、</p>
<p>本年年初、工部局曾允准於預算案内開列銀十五萬兩、以供私立學校之補助費、此欵已經納稅人年會通過、惟至今尚未實行支用、</p>
<p>工部局敎育委員會、對於補助費之章程、於起草及翻譯時、皆曾詳爲斟酌、以期中文及英文文義一致、其中原有一節關於課程大綱者、曾引起非常之困難、緣曾有慮及以此或引起華人方面之誤會故經過敎育委員會之充分討論後、一致主張參加以修正、將此節修改如左、</p>
<p>第十條乙、各學校應鼓勵學童愛國及爲良好之市民、凡敎課中有足以傷國民感情及引起民族間仇視者、不得用之、</p>
<p>此項修正案、已由工部局批准、</p>
<p>在敎育委員會討論之中、曾經聲明、此項關於禁止易於引起民族開仇視之敎課一欵、起草之時尚在現今政局情形發生以前、故此項規定、與現在界内兩民族間之閡隔情形、絶無關係、且工部局絶無意對華人學校爲過分之干涉、蓋工部局爲一大市區之行政機開、故對私立學校供以補助費、乃係其責任而絶無意禁止各該學校内之愛國舉動也、敎育　員會之主席又經聲明、此項禁止條文之設、實因各該校旣設於國際的会共租界之内、則其敎課自應以增進國際上合作及友誼爲基礎、即在現今緊張情况之下、敎育委員會有良好之機會、以表明學校内之愛國舉動、不必引起民族間惡感之原、彼信學校之内、引導兒童愛國、而不令其因此對本界内别一民族發生此恨、此因可能之事也（未完）</p>

<p>丨打倒楊氏一九二九年所造</p>
<p>丨二時二九分五三秒八紀錄</p>
<p>石金生一年中之苦練、成責進步如飛、試走時曾造二時十九分之驚人紀錄、昨日雖未達最高成績、然已打倒英人楊氏、一九二九年所造二時二九分五十三秒八之紀錄、石之二時二七分○三秒遂成新紀錄、</p>
<h3 id="c88">奮鬭經過 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>石金生始終任前鋒</p>
<p>冠軍石金生成績旣創新紀錄、而自始至終、均居最先、全軍五十餘名、祇能望其項背、第二名相差幾一英里、難能之至</p>
<p>鳴槍起步捷足登先</p>
<p>七時五十分、六十四名選手、在卡德路口依號碼而列、中華隊四人在最左角、點名畢排列畢、俾斯雷槍聲一發六十餘雙飛脚、同時發動、石金生·侯根仁·捷足先登、前領向靜安寺進發、紐其堡·希蓬·金氏·法蘭斯·謝行導·隨後</p>
<p>靜安寺前三人並駕</p>
<p>行抵靜安寺前、方祗一英里石金生·紐其堡·台維斯三人並駕而進、其後五十碼爲周如泉·謝行導·法蘭斯·希篷·金氏·張錄洲·希列騰·乞米亞寗·洛斯·侯根仁</p>
<p>兆豐花園漸分前後</p>
<p>過格斯菲路、達向利南路、行經兆豐花園前、路程計三英里半、其時八點二十分、各人前後漸見參差、紐其堡緊追石金生、七十碼後、英人法蘭斯聳肩而進又三十碼、謝行導周如泉並肩而來、金氏·台維斯·希篷更後二十餘碼、侯根仁又後矣、</p>
<p>羅别根路一躍居前</p>
<p>沿蘇州河、循前狀而進、折入羅别根路、將至林肯路交界處、爲程六英里、佔全程三分之一、石金生已將紐其堡抛落、一躍居先、紐在石後一百碼、法蘭斯與石相去二百碼矣、周謝五十碼仍並肩進、金氏台維斯希篷、前後隨行侯根仁尚居後方</p>
<p>虹橋路上形勢緊張</p>
<p>羅别根路畢、向西轉入虹橋路已去八英里、其時中英兩隊正競爭最烈難測勝負、周如泉已於羅别根路上趕出謝行導石金生仍居首席紐其堡不計外、第二名爲法蘭斯相去一百二十碼、周謝又各離五十碼、金氏台維斯亦離八十碼而來侯根仁追上希篷在台維斯後僅差五六碼耳、</p>
<p>分别計之、華隊佔一三四七位、而英人而二五六八、</p>
<p>交通大學侯氏加鞭</p>
<p>虹橋路上、侯根仁以加快速度、追過台維斯、過交通大學到海格路、侯又越過台維斯追在謝行導後三十碼、此爲十二英里、離終點尚三分之一、侯之努力實爲獲勝關鍵辣斐德路而亞爾培路、侯又追出法蘭斯在金氏後、列第四名威海衛路又越金氏周如泉、而與紐其堡爭長、努力加鞭、爲國爭光、侯氏有焉、</p>
<p>冠軍進塲歡聲雷動</p>
<p>侯根仁之追上、中華隊希望大增、石金生之第一、已無問題、十時二十七分許、石金生於歡聲雷動中進場、紐其堡侯根仁、在一英里之後而進侯終以數步之差、敗於紐氏、深爲可惜、第三名周如泉差三十碼、其後爲英人金氏等、謝行導列第十、中華隊、隊以十四分冠軍、保持錦標第四軍</p>

<p>汪氏訓詞代表團總指揮汪劍餘將來滬請願目的申述後即由汪氏訓詞云各位代表這次各位不辭跋涉從南京到上海兄弟心中覺得很不安本來想在舍下招待各位但因地方太淺窄所以借伍公館來和各位見而前次上海和平會議也是在此開會每日在此接見上海各團體代表今日又能在此與諸君見面雖則地方仍是不夠但是兄弟實想借此機會表示對於諸君的敬意兄弟此次來上海是因爲共赴國難而來我們試看世界這二百年來的歷史在這二百年中世界上滅亡的國家不知有多少但是同時不知有多少國家雖然受盡種種壓迫而仍然能夠奮鬥圖存的現在中國是正受着日本侵略壓迫的時候有許多人就以爲中國是不能夠抵抗日本對於國事抱着無限的悲觀但是這種態度對麽我們試看世界各國的歷史那一個國家没有經過危險的時期譬如一八七一年普法戰事之役法國時時都有亡國的可能現在各位義勇軍的裝束也正是當時法國人民的義勇軍一樣情形因爲法國的國民能夠努力奮鬭所以法國終於得救了而且自那個時候起法國從此没有帝制和共和之爭也没有路易復辟拿破崙帝制復活的恐怖現在法國在世界上依然是一個强盛的國家我們再看民國七年我國大革命的時候那時德國乘戰勝之威和俄國講和俄國政府簽訂屈辱講和條約很多人以爲俄國就此就亡了俄國的革命也從此便失敗了但是事實不然因爲俄國國民能一致奮鬭所以俄國到現在還是生存在世界之上我們又可以看民國八年時德國那時德國戰敗之後受着各國種種的壓迫時時都有亡國的可能但是因爲德國國民堅忍奮鬭所以德國最後也是得救如此看來中國現在雖然是一個危險時期但是我們挽救危亡一定是有辦法的不過救國的辦法是要國民自動的想出來這才是眞正的辦法但是現在有一些人他們說現在現察國民黨的政府如果和日本宣戰打敗之後國民黨一定要滅亡否則如果國民黨與日本講和則可加國民黨以賣國之罪也是要滅亡的但是說這些說話的人如果是愛國的國民絶不會這樣因爲在國難當前的時候誰也不該應拿外交來對付内政的就黨外來說是如此就黨内來說即如與兄弟共事的一派同志雖然是向來反對南京政府的但自始至終都是爲實現民五政治而反對南京政府絶不肯將外交的問題來作内爭的工具的至於應付目前外交辦法兄弟以爲有八個字「一面抵抗一面交涉」我們要知道此次日本出兵是爲世界各國公理所不容的一則他違反國際聯盟一則他違反非戰公約記得民國三年德國和法國戰爭之際時爲德國出兵經過比利時破壞了比利時的中立所以英國便來伐德何况這回日本出兵東北比德國出兵比利時還要無理呢故此各國爲着他們本國的光榮計爲着維持世界和平計一定是要干涉的但是如果中國與日本宣戰則形勢又不同了他們各國就可以守中立於此有須注意的不宣戰并不是不抵抗這次日本的舉動正如强盗明火打刦一般我們如果遇着强盗入室惟一的方法便是一面向他迎頭痛擊一面鳴笛報警協同捉拿所以兄弟主張一面要抵抗而一面仍要交涉若果能如此做去不至於絶對失望的現在各處義勇軍的組織就是齊心共赴國難的一種表示有些人以爲現在的義勇軍訓練未成熟槍械不充足如何能夠有濟於事呢其實不然的因爲義勇軍雖然在物質上不完備但是他的精神是很可寳貴的其效用也至少必能喚起全國國民的注意使他們都有武裝抵抗的决心果如此則國家必定能有最後的挽救關於錦州設立中立區及共管天津的問題記得當時和平會議的時候有外交原則方針由雙方協定交涉則由南京政府辦理的决議所以兄弟聽到有錦州設立中立區及共管天津區的消息之後即時便打電去南京詢問雖然至今未接得回電但今日何敬之邵力子兩位先生從南京到上海爲的是說明此事據說并没有錦州設立中立區及天津共管一回事所以我們也可以放心一點了關於兄弟去南京的問題這或者在最近的將來就可以實現了本來和平會議之後大家决定派孫李陳三位返粤兄弟與伍鄒三人則留上海以候將來的結果現在南京和廣州的四全會都已經將四屆中委選出上海的退席代表也同時辦了選舉放此現在只等他們從廣州到來則兄弟便可以和他們一齊到南京去我們到南京的目的對外是共赴國難對内是實現民主政治共赴國難與實現民主政治其實只是一件事情因爲要有民主政治才能使人民有共赴國難的可能呀現在廣州方面的同志將於明日動身大約數日間便可到滬然則兄弟在南京與各位見面之期將不遠了今日對於各位此次來滬的熱情兄弟完全接受并對各位表示最深的敬意</p>

<p>靑年自動赴東北援馬抗日團、昨晚集二百八十餘人、擬乘夜快車赴京北上、路局因接中央電示、勸阻該團北行、因該團靑年雖熱心可嘉、但以夙昔未受軍事訓練、資斧服裝穀糧又毫無儲備、即使歷盡艱辛、能達到目的地、亦於馬占山將軍毫無援助、徒足增重馬軍之累、故决計勸其緩行、至少須先電達馬將軍報告一切、得有復允、方可許其前進、以後如有類似此項之組織、亦决嚴切勸阻云、兹將詳情分誌於後、</p>

<p>北站辦法、因須經過租界、結隊而行、殊爲不便、乃令團員個人自動赴北站集合、該團并備飯十二桌於會中、俾無家室之團員、可在團中就膳、膳畢、即出發赴北站、</p>

<p>北站訣别午後一時、各團員齊集於北站約有團員百餘人到塲歡送者、有中華全國道路協會、北平女界抗日救國團、志毅小學、全國律師協會、中國體育學校、惠生助產學校救護隊、法政美專兩江各校、及商務印書館義勇軍、郵務公會義勇軍、市民聯合會義勇軍、南市義勇軍、北市義勇軍等、统計歡送民衆凡萬餘人、義勇軍凡二千餘人、乃開訣别大會、由該團及各歡送機關代表相繼演說詞甚悲壯、大致謂願援馬團與彼倭寇决一雌雄、滅此朝食、他日雖戰死沙塲、亦足表揚我大中華民國之民族精神云云、</p>
<p>出發人數該團團員日前本有四五四人、因赴東北實行戰爭、故將團員加以甄别、結果有百餘人體弱、不能上戰線、乃得三百二十餘人、但昨日赴北火車站者、僅一百七十九人、而臨時在站加入者、又有一百餘人、故共有三百人左右、内中有兩人係女性、</p>
<p>捐助車資該團於出發前、曾向路局接洽免費乘車無效、昨日一時後赴北站復因團員經濟、均甚困窘、無力購買、當由在塲歡送者、醵集巨資、以作車費、共捐得約五百元、有當塲質衣捐贈者、而道路協會代表陳維新君、（前開封市長）更將身穿之大衣及呢帽囊中之十餘元、全數捐贈、見者感嘆不止、該團乃得照常買票登車、</p>
<p>家屬送行自午後一時至晚間十一時、團員齊集車站時、有團員之嬌妻稚子、或白髮高堂、牽衣而泣、但團員多絶裾拒絶、亦有逼於兒女之情者、則臨時含淚退出、惟甚少數云、</p>
<p>臨别贈言該會幹事黄警頑語個中同志云、各界熱血的義士、念馬軍之孤懸、苦戰力疲、犧牲了一切、以抗暴日、彼畏葸不前之軍隊、聞之能無愧死、今祝援馬團前往、必能收回失地、救東北人民於水深火熱之中、希望諸位義士凱旋而還、早日相見</p>
<p>出發情形團中自解决乘車問題後、已將六時、乃由團長令全體團員齊赴月臺上、是時赴站歡送之民衆萬餘人咸含淚相送、七時後、團員陸續上車、八時登車畢、</p>
<p>被阻情形援馬團登車後、滿擬於昨晚十二時開車、乃路局奉命阻止、通知該團、須儘夜快車先開、以後再開團員車、詎該團員及送行之義勇軍、均不之信、謂須團員車先開、方可開夜快車、各義勇軍并均坐於軌上、阻開夜快車、以防受欺、截止本報上版時、尚無開車消息、</p>
<p>各地加入新聲社記者向該團探得、鎭錫京漢等地民衆、紛紛來函願加入出發東北者甚多、該團乃函復屆時候於各當地車站俟該團經過時加入、共赴東北、故此次在滬出發雖僅三百人、但至黑恐有數千人云、</p>
<p>後方顧問該團幹事黄警頑趙耀全談伯質等三人、已組織後方顧問團、專司該團後方事宜、因該團雖赴東北、而作後方工作、亦甚爲重切云、</p>

<p>立國之道、第一在能守、能守而後進可以戰、退可以和、敵攻瀋陽、則守瀋陽、敵攻吉林、則守吉林、敵攻錦州、則守錦州、敵攻天津、則守天津、各地軍事當局、旣負守土之責、敵來當然防禦、用不着請示高級長官、請示中央政府、果能如此、使敵無懈可擊自然垂頭喪氣而歸、我人惟一之希望在此、惟一之主張在此、</p>
<p>即使某地爲敵所乘、第一防線不能守、守第二防線、再不能守、守第三防線果然賣足氣力、力盡而退、敵人决不敢輕視、而國人亦且感於義勇、樂爲後援、試觀馬占山苦戰之結果、齊齊哈爾雖終於陷落、而日方報紙且大書特書、表示其不勝欽仰、各方助餉、至今猶絡繹不絶、張學良關内外全部之兵力、豈止數十倍於黑省孤軍手下軍官、豈必無馬占山其人、後方接濟之從容又豈黑省偏隅可比、九月十八·十九·二十·二十一·等日、如果嬰城固守、誓死苦鬥、絶不退讓經過若干時間、國際間當有起而援應者、即使以敵兵壓迫之故、終於失守瀋陽、失守吉林、日人必不致如今日之覷我無能、横行無忌、而國人且將以待馬占山者待張學良、使中華國譽上、民族人格上、雖敗猶榮、且亦示必一敗塗地也、專取守勢、不取攻勢、在日方又豈能以戎首誣我、</p>
<p>過去不說、說未來、吾人所要求政府、曰守、彼攻錦州、則守錦州、何必急急贊成劃中立區、彼攻天津、則守天津、何必自動請求各國共管、難道彼攻首都、而亦請各國共管首都麽、</p>
<p>此之請求、决不能說强人所難、國家養兵二百萬人、百姓每年擔負養兵費四萬萬圓、設竟併守而不能、政府乎、其將何以對我全國人民乎、</p>
<p>如曰能之、則何必急急妥協、一方堅守、一方宣言采行國際聯盟條約第十六條斷絶商業關係、禁止人民各種往來、經過六個月乃至一年、請看日本變化如何、</p>
<p>讀者諸君、吾人所請求政府、僅僅一「守」字然而最近消息何如、諸君曾注意昨報載下列數條乎、</p>
<p>（一）施肇基送照會於國聯秘書長、對撤退軍隊至長城以内、及中立區執行警務等事、將中國地位加以說明、南京政府主張、並無何項變更、惟承認中立區域、附有若干不可少之形式、</p>
<p>（二）國聯秘書長、將所得於施公使之情報、通知各會員、此項情報、大都爲中國顧外長與南京政府其他要人、關於錦州地位之談判、</p>
<p>（三）日軍之撤回瀋陽、因華人有自動的將其軍隊撤入關内之擔任、今若拒絶中立區之設立、是中國失信之證、此消息而確者、尚得謂政府未嘗傾向妥協乎、諸君其注意、</p>

<p>淸光緒十六年正月。中國駐俄公使楊子通星使儒。病劇於俄都。竟致不起。俄王與后。遣官賜唁。情文優渥。嗣該國睰哇報。得日本東京訪電。述日本某報言。楊使爲俄人自樓上推之而下。遂致殞命云云。諾哇報主筆乃著論駁之。極痛快淋漓之致。略謂今上（指俄王）爲太子時。曾東游日本。突被日人狙擊。幾至不獲生還。又中國李文忠奉命赴日本馬關議和。亦被日人槍擊彈入於頗然亦幸而不死。日人行事。旣如此放恣。其發言亦安知顧忌耶。此事見張君鳳輝所著俄游述感中。足見日人造謡。保其慣技。自昔已然。於今爲烈矣。</p>

<p>張巡許遠吾讀唐書。尹子奇圍睢陽。城中食盡。張巡與許遠謀曰。「睢陽江淮之保障。若棄之。賊必乘勝長驅。是無江淮也。且我衆飢疲。走必不遠。不如堅守待救。」於是以茶紙爲食。旣盡食馬。馬盡羅雀掘鼠食之。雀鼠又盡。巡出愛妾。殺以饗士。賊登城。士卒病不能戰。巡西向再拜曰。「臣力竭矣。生無以報陛下。死當爲厲鬼以殺賊。」城陷。巡遠俱被執。子奇曰。「聞君戰時。眥裂齒碎。何也。」巡曰「吾志吞逆賊。恨力不能耳。」與其將南霽雲雷萬春三十六人。皆被殺。初張巡被困。以府署爲帥堂。懸高祖像。俛伏痛哭。以厲士卒。其忠勇如是。</p>

<p>「海粟。我同了二位朋友來看你的畫呀。」他說「我來介紹罷。這是羅隆基。這一位。是王小姐。</p>
<p>他自己一張一張將我堆積在一邊的畫理出來靠在畫架上。坦率地站在那裡看。看一回。談了好幾回。每看一張畫。總是「海粟。海粟」的。用了對自己手足一般的親密談着話。我也不知不覺底像我的兄弟到了家的親密。不多久。我們的朋友顧蔭亭從南京來。他又像是出於意外的與蔭亭叙了闊别。那樣子。很自然。像和自然同化着似的。他又很熱心地呌蔭亭看我的畫。後來大家又談了東北的事和翡冷翠的事。他憶起翡冷翠的幽秘。他又洋洋地感歎着國事。一直談到五點他才回去。臨行他又說。「海粟。你等一會兒早些到我家一同去程霖生那裡吃晚飯看石濤。」</p>
<p>大約七點左右。我到志靡家。他在樓上又是那樣狂喊。坐了一刻。王文柏也來了。他把看畫的事一一提起。又促文柏快去看我的畫。文柏總是拿微笑對付他。</p>
<p>停了一會。我們就到程家去。走進宅内。倭人引路。一直到客廳裡面去。却是程先生還没有回家。只有三個中年的紳士或是富商。後來由翁君引我們去遍看程君所藏的銅器。却有不少珍異。程先生回來以後。和我大談了一通石濤。志摩只是靜靜地傾聽着。</p>
<p>喫飯時。又講了許多關於中國書畫的話。程先生對於我們。是很尊敬的。他和文柏又談了上海經濟現狀。這一段話我是很外行。所以忘得乾乾凈凈</p>
<p>飯後。我們充滿着希望。希望快看石濤。</p>
<p>當程先生展開石濤的「百美圖」大手卷時。我們便都不開口。只是謹愼地注視着。看完了「百美圖」以後。又連看了十幾個手卷。有山氷。墨蘭。墨菊。羅漢。一直看到十二點。</p>
<p>「好極了。好極了」我們不約而同的說。</p>
<p>這時候又來了朱慶瀾。查勉仲。又大談了黑龍江的事和賑災的事。朱先生是眞實的慈善家。他是眞能爲災民請命的。他的人望。也就非常之大呀。我想。中國近三十年來。未曾有過他那麽一個可以使人感戴的人。勉仲近幾年來也脫離了敎育事業。跟着朱先生救災。因爲中國是一個災難的國呀</p>
<p>「不早了。一點左右了。不要儘管纒着不肯走開。」我這樣說。於是我同志摩文柏三人就告别主人出了宅門。</p>
<p>。菊惟黄州落瓣。子瞻見之。始大愧服云云。李君則謂此事是歐公。非蘇子瞻。介甫詠殘菊。歐陽永叔戲爲續成秋花不比春花落兩句。介甫聞之。笑曰。歐九不學之過也。豈不見楚辭有夕餐秋菊之落英乎。余因記前曾見宋牧仲所著筠廊偶筆一書。曾及此事。謂官黄州數年。種菊甚多。不見有落瓣者。並考黄州志。及關於黄州風土物產諸書。亦不載子瞻見菊飄落事。此疑俗說。不足信。惟考史某菊譜後序。則云菊有落者。有不落者。蓋花瓣結密者不落。若花瓣扶疏者。盛開之後。漸見離披。遇風雨撼之。則飄散滿地矣。今按此說較爲有據。以扶疏結密之異。遂有落與不落之分。然使不遇風雨之撼。雖疏瓣離披。亦必乾枯而不遽飄落。此宜各處之菊皆然。不必定在黄州也。或又謂楚辭秋菊落英之落。當作始字解。爾雅。俶落權輿。始也。毛詩落之落。亦訓始。因謂菊之始開。芳香可愛。若衰落而後。豈復有可餐之味。其理解亦適。然他書所用落英二字。不可枚舉。未有作始花者。即餐飄落之菊瓣。以寄孤潔之意。亦何不可。友人李君又云。結密者不落。而扶疏離披。不能禁風雨之撼。聞此語也。又當爲我國現是横受侵侮悲矣。嗚呼</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第一章漁陽鼙鼓</p>
<p>但是太陽國人常有開拓土地移殖人民的雄心。與遠慮。所以他把我們的M三省視爲早晚是他們的領土。没有一天忘情的。他們國内的政治家。軍事家。敎育家。工商家。……可以說全國的人民念念不忘。要取到這塊俎上肉。滿足他們的慾望。所以千方百計。七取强奪。用盡種種的方法來經營土地。攘權奪利。我們只要一讀他們「田中内閣侵略中國滿蒙積極政策奏章一書」就要憬然悟。悚然懼。不寒而慄了。這本奏章本來是很秘密的。也是他們國裏的賣國奴偷出來賣給我們的。自從這奏章洩漏而後。太陽國的侵略野心更是明明白白。不但中國人要震驚。其他各强國也要戒懼了。無如中國人無論執政者在下者。目光祇知看到國内而不顧國外。所以自己人好似有了不共戴天之仇。二十年來。内戰不息。兄弟鬩牆。喪失了許多精神。許多元氣。許多金錢。許多生命。……鬧得千瘡百孔。四分五裂。更加阒洪水流行。哀鴻滿野。太陽國人便趁這當兒。急急下手。雖然找不到什麽出師題目。也要蠻幹一下了。S城的人民本來睡在厝火積薪之下。禍變隨時可以發生。臥榻之旁早經他人鼾睡的了。這一遭不過首當其衝。先受其殃罷咧。那北大營裏的軍隊長官早已奉到無抵抗的命令。因爲前數天太陽國裏增兵運械。表面上雖鎭靜。暗地裏已在發動。可憐這時我國人積弱不振。那裏敢談到防禦呢。好如病人躺在牀上。聽天由命而已。所以太陽國人突然襲擊。北大營裏的軍士毫無抵抗。砲彈如雨而下。有幾個勇敢的軍人。雖很願拚着一死。抵禦一下。無如軍令難違。大家只好整隊而退。退出這個北大營。太陽國軍隊乘勢追殺。將我國所有的兵工廠迫擊砲廠飛機塲一一佔領。北大營火勢衝天。黑烟彌空。可憐東北精華付之一炬。藉寇兵而齎盗糧。眞是天下最可痛心的事。將來國恥史上最傷心的一頁。</p>

<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>在今日的世界樂壇上最著名的第一流提琴家可以數得到的有這幾個辛巴里斯德德和愛耳曼這是北歐提琴界的兩顆明星克拉意斯婁是維也納同巴黎所產生的一大名手帝包是法國的提琴名家他們四人都是匈牙利提琴名敎師奥佛爾的入室弟子他們現在都已享得了盛名旅行世界各國作音樂的巡禮他們差不多都曾來過上海獻過他們藝術的神技最近又有一個世界名提琴家海菲慈Hoifeiz第一次在上海舉行獨奏會地點在新光大戲院</p>
<p>海菲慈是一個音樂神童他很知道愛惜他的神童天才並不爲了那容易獲得的先榮而自暴自棄也不像其他的藝術家一樣在靑年時代沉溺於虚榮和驕傲的炫術裏</p>
<p>一般愛好音樂的人多半歡喜比較各著名音樂家的長短同時更喜歡把他們評列名次這原是没有什麽意義的一種玩意兒因爲像克拉意斯婁帝包愛耳曼和海飛慈這幾位大提琴家他們都已獲得了第一流音樂大師的地位原是没有所謂最先最末或第一第二的了他們本身都是同樣地站在一道水平線以上不過在聽衆方面免不了有主觀的觀察當然是要有所褒貶的了</p>
<p>假使你們要我把上面幾位提琴名家下一個簡括的評判那我只可以告訴你們克拉意斯婁是一個古曲派的樂家帝包是一個蠱惑性的藝術家愛耳曼是一個漂浪者海菲慈是一個精嫻音律者從外貌上我們可以一望而知海菲慈是一個精嫻音律的人你看他登台時那筆直的姿勢彷彿是神聖不可侵犯的樣子臉部神色泰然一些没有不自然的表情有許多人說他太冷淡那是一種膚淺的觀察我願意那一般專門愛看面部扮鬼怪或舉動輕佻的聽衆閉上眼睛歛神靜聽一下你們自　感覺到海菲慈的樂調他的奮激他的活耀他决不是一個冷淡的人他的音律並不是機械式的他有他的特殊天才他是一個音樂大師他在第一次獨奏會裏（十一月二十日）所奏演的節目很有精彩區大利Vitlai的「古舞曲一LaChacnne很淸鮮很閃耀拉羅Lalo的「西班牙交響曲」很古雅同時也很都麗流暢在第二部份中包含有巴赫（Bach）德比西（Debussy）德法拉（DeFala）拉車爾（Ravel）諸名家的傑作</p>
<p>海菲慈是海飛慈他有他特殊的威權他有爲他人所没有的優先權他的技巧有時把他牽引得太飄遠了總觀他在第一夜所奏演的樂曲能各盡其長充分表現出每一種作品的精髓巴赫的「泳嘆曲」是古典派的製作德比西的「羊毛髮的姑娘」和德法拉的Jota都是拉了派風味十足的作品雖缺少古典派的寛大性和緩和性也脫盡了法蘭西和西班牙的温柔綺麗但却有濃淡調和得很平匀的意味</p>
<p>凡是聽過海菲慈第一次獨奏音樂會的人在他們的回憶中一定可以長久保留着這些美妙的印像LaChaconne唱着那快活的圓舞曲拉韋爾的「漂浪樂曲」悲傷地啜泣着拉羅的「詼諧曲」發出非常輕决的閃耀光彩</p>
<p>鋼琴伴奏者亞克龍Achron彈奏的技術很能出神入化可惜聽衆不能聽得淸楚尤其在伴奏「西班牙交響曲」時他彈得實然太低輕了</p>

<p>在StationaryOffice出版的第十二卷以及最後的一卷第十三卷的"TgeMladicalHistory　of　the　War也不久就將出版這一部是官家方面編的而另爲一個赫勃古將軍寫的一部「第五軍」也許會驚動一時的因爲這一本書將一切最重要的内幕都揭露出來了内容方面有許多地方關涉到一些有身份的政治家和軍人的名譽的</p>

<p>Using Suppressing Bandits as Pretext to Search Villages</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs Again</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou Telegram: The Japanese side has dispatched many Japanese nationals to serve as station masters in the Xinmin Baiqibao area. Japanese troops intend to move west. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandit Flames Still Blaze in Raoyang River: On the sixth day at noon, more than fifty Japanese soldiers arrived at Baiqibao and searched nearby villages, then returned to Xinmin Liuhegou. A train of Japanese soldiers, carrying about two hundred troops, was stationed there, with extremely tight patrols around. At Juliuhe Station, Japanese soldiers built thirty barracks. On the sixth day, a train carrying bullets and supplies was transported from Xinmin. On the sixth day at noon, two Japanese planes arrived in Goubangzi and scouted for half an hour before heading east. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's Tokyo newspapers reported that Japanese planes dropped bombs at two locations southwest of Shenyang, Gongtaipu (transliteration) and near Xinmin, Tianpingtai (transliteration). It is reported that a total of three hundred bandits were killed. Also, today there was a battle between Japanese soldiers and bandits in Yingtou (transliteration), north of Shenyang. Details are unknown. (Sixth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Japan Prepares to Use Force to Compel</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a message from Shenyang that has been censored, Honjo, the commander of the Japanese army in Manchuria, has issued a final warning to Zhang Xueliang, urging him to withdraw troops from Jinzhou and areas east of Jinzhou. (Sixth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government still hopes that Zhang Xueliang can reconsider the issue of withdrawing his troops into the pass. However, Tokyo officials now admit that the military authorities have decided to use force to compel him to withdraw his troops if he does not do so voluntarily. This is because the Japanese military authorities believe that the situation cannot be stabilized unless this source of trouble is cleared. The Japanese authorities are eager to avoid attacking Jinzhou, because if the Chinese troops are attacked, they will inevitably retreat into the pass in disarray, or serious conflicts will occur between Shanhaiguan and Japanese troops, causing the war to spread within the country. Therefore, if the use of force is necessary, the Japanese military authorities will first try to intimidate the Jinzhou garrison with demonstrations, to show that if the Chinese army ignores their intimidation, the Japanese army will take action. According to Japanese officials, the Japanese military authorities believe that since the Chinese army did not withdraw westward after the Japanese army withdrew eastward on November 28, the Chinese are only afraid of force and regard moderate actions as a sign of weakness. Tokyo still receives news that Chinese troops are operating east of Jinzhou, and one unit has arrived in Hebei, opposite Niuzhuang. Officials neither deny nor confirm the news that Honjo has warned Zhang Xueliang to withdraw the Jinzhou troops into the pass, but say that it is probably within expectations.

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese are spreading propaganda that fourteen trains of Chinese military vehicles are moving from Shanhaiguan to Jinzhou. Military attachés and counselors from various countries took a special train to Shanhaiguan on the fifth to investigate along the way. They returned to Jinzhou on the sixth. It is said that the journey was peaceful and no military vehicles were seen. They have reported to their respective countries. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Secretly Instructed by the Japanese</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou Telegram: An American reporter, suspected of being supported by Japan, sneaked into Jinzhou from Shenyang yesterday to spy on the military situation. According to his translator's tip-off, the reporter was under Honjo's secret orders to spread rumors that there were many bandits around Jinzhou and that Chinese troops were concentrated in Goubangzi. He was to send these rumors to the British and American media for major propaganda so that no one would object to the Japanese army sending troops to attack Jinzhou again. The Beining Bridge, which was destroyed by the Japanese army, has been repaired and opened to traffic. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) More than eighty Japanese soldiers reoccupied Yingkou at noon on the fifth and warned the Beining Railway Bureau: (1) No repairing of the destroyed railway tracks. (2) No transporting away of the iron materials from the Yingkou-Goubangzi branch line, otherwise they will be stopped by force within a few days. Therefore, the planned opening of the Yingkou-Goubangzi branch line on the sixth did not materialize. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jinzhou urgent telegram says that at noon on the fifth, Japanese troops reoccupied Yingkou. The Japanese army claimed that it was not a withdrawal but a rotation of troops, and put forward the following conditions to the Beining Railway Bureau: (1) The locomotives, vehicles, and materials parked at Yingkou Station are not allowed to be moved or damaged. The damaged tracks are not allowed to be repaired, otherwise they will be stopped by gunfire. It was also stated that the Japanese army would not be responsible for all losses. The tracks north of the station were again destroyed. Eight locomotives and important documents were detained by the Japanese army. The section chief and stationmaster of the Yingkou-Goubangzi branch line have all withdrawn. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Seventy to eighty Japanese troops, who had withdrawn from Yingkou to Henan, occupied the station in Henan at noon on the fifth, and dismantled the tracks about one mile north of the station. Eight locomotives were parked at the station, and important parts of them were dismantled by the Japanese. The order at the station was greatly disrupted. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japan Still Insists on Freedom to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Drafting Committee Meets with Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>Demands Arita Make Public Explanation</p>
<p>Suggestion Made That Resolution Be Accompanied by Japanese Declaration</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the resignation of Shi Zhaoji, the chief representative of China, has not been approved by the Nanjing government, the work of the Council has been slightly affected. However, the meeting is still proceeding as usual. The Drafting Committee of the Council met once this morning. In the afternoon, the Council held another meeting. In addition to the Chinese and Japanese representatives, the twelve Council members were present. It was decided that the Drafting Committee would meet with the Chinese representative Shi and the Japanese representative Arita at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday for consultations. It is reported that the Council has a firm stance on the issue of establishing a neutral zone near Jinzhou. The Council has also notified the Japanese that if Arita can issue a declaration at the next plenary session explaining the bandit suppression matters and allowing other representatives to make public criticisms, then the section on bandit suppression in the declaration drafted by Briand, the chairman of the Council, can also be cancelled. Therefore, the Council is now striving to overcome a difficult hurdle. It naturally does not believe in the rumor of Shi Zhaoji's resignation, because if Shi resigns, it would be tantamount to China abandoning its request to the League of Nations. The Council held a closed-door meeting at 4 p.m. today to discuss the Japanese amendment to the solution to the Manchurian Incident and consider the report of the Drafting Committee. It adjourned at 5:30 p.m. to await the outcome of the Drafting Committee's meeting with the Chinese and Japanese representatives at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday before deciding on subsequent steps. At the same time, the Chinese and Japanese representatives have received their respective governments' replies to the Council's resolution and submitted them to the Council. Both sides have made statements regarding the establishment of a neutral zone, which is the most difficult issue to deal with since the Council began discussing the Manchurian issue. Currently, the Japanese side still insists on the necessity of freely disposing of police power within the Manchurian region, while the Council feels that the members of the inspection team should be stationed in Manchuria to monitor the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the Japanese army's attacks on bandits and all illegal elements. Furthermore, the precedent of the joint dispatch of troops by Nicaragua and the United States to suppress the rebel General Sandino several years ago should also be used as a reference. Ito, the legal adviser of the Japanese delegation, met with the Drafting Committee for two and a half hours at 11 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Ito has telegraphed the amendments to Article 5 of the Council's resolution and the Briand Declaration to Tokyo. (Fifth Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Administrative Council met at 4 p.m. this afternoon. The Chinese and Japanese representatives did not attend. It listened to the report of the Drafting Committee on its meeting with Ito this morning and approved the measures proposed by the Committee. It adjourned at 5:15 p.m. It is reported that it has been decided to be satisfied with the Japanese opinions related to the fifth paragraph of the resolution. The issues of bandit suppression and neutral zones have not been resolved. The Drafting Committee is scheduled to meet with Dr. Shi at 3:30 p.m. on the sixth and then meet with Ito.

<p>(Paris) A well-informed Chinese personage recently told our agency that the resignation of Shi and Gu shows that the situation is serious and the difficulties are not easy to overcome. A few days ago, the Chinese delegation proposed that the Chinese troops in Jinzhou could withdraw, but on the condition that Japan promised not to advance towards Jinzhou. Up to this point, the Japanese delegation retains the right to intervene in North China at any time, and said that the time of intervention will be determined by Japan. Moreover, the withdrawal of Chinese troops must be conditional on the arrival and operation of observers from neutral countries in Jinzhou. Japan still opposes this. Under these circumstances, the Chinese delegation will inevitably consider the proposed matter to be invalid. Chinese public opinion is extremely sentimental about the Paris negotiations, believing that the task of the League of Nations is to prevent and punish all acts of aggression. If China withdraws its troops unconditionally from a part of its territory, then China, as the victim, will also be in the position of an accomplice, which is unacceptable. Chinese public opinion would rather have a solution similar to the resolution of October 24. Although that resolution was not implemented, it still recognized China as having a reason in spirit. On the other hand, all other resolutions with provisions for the withdrawal of Chinese troops would make China fail in spirit and acknowledge Japan's right to permanent intervention in China. Even if Gu remains in his position, the above issues still exist. Therefore, the progress of the League of Nations' work has become secondary due to the above startling news. The memorandum submitted by China yesterday has been considered by the Executive Yuan. This morning, Ito submitted his opinions again. The Executive Yuan is extremely busy. Shi Zhaoji's memorandum contains a total of ten articles, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Shi opposes the extension of the neutral zone to the Great Wall. The proposal to establish a neutral zone originated from the three major powers. Since a guarantee that Japan will no longer advance in Manchuria cannot be obtained from Japan, the issue of the withdrawal of Chinese troops no longer exists. Moreover, since Japanese troops have withdrawn to the railway, there is already a neutral zone between Jinzhou and the railway. To provide the Executive Yuan with a guarantee that hostile actions will not recur, the Japanese army must not advance. Japan has also agreed to this. As for China, it has adopted peaceful means from the beginning, which has been proven. To ask Chinese troops to withdraw from Jinzhou can be called a shot in the dark. However, if the major powers are willing to send international troops to maintain order, China can also accept it. If the Japanese army advances towards the Great Wall again, China will take the necessary actions for legitimate defense, and reserves this right. Shi's memorandum concludes that it is not appropriate for others to force the withdrawal of Chinese troops from their own territory. The special feature of today is that China's attitude has suddenly become strong. The task of the Drafting Committee, which will meet tomorrow, feels difficult. (Fifth Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Drafting Committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon to discuss the revision of the resolution, in which two points are not far from resolution. Last night, Ito met with Cecil on the words related to the fifth paragraph of the resolution and the duties of the investigation committee, and suggested revising the provision that the issue of troop withdrawal should never be transferred to the duties of the investigation committee. Ito and Cecil believe that this amendment can be accepted by Japan and the Administrative Council. If Tokyo thinks this is the case, it can be resolved this afternoon. Japanese troops on the Beining Line are again engaged in major activities. Shi Zhaoji was beaten and injured in the eye in Paris. The East Railway Station in Beiping was occupied by students and cannot be opened to traffic. According to Japanese sources, Honjo Shigeru urged Zhang Xueliang to withdraw the Jinzhou garrison (see domestic important telegrams). Germany denies stopping the payment of private debts. British and French economic negotiations have not been successful (see foreign telegrams). The Citizens' United Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday (see local news).</p>

<p>Someone has proposed a clever suggestion to this problem that can avoid the opposition of some members of the Administrative Council in acknowledging Japan's right to freely suppress bandits and can satisfy Japan. This suggestion advocates that the issue of bandit suppression should not be mentioned in the resolution or in the introduction, but the Japanese representative may issue a declaration reserving the right to take action to suppress bandits when necessary. The Administrative Council may record this declaration without formally voting on it. However, the above suggestion has not yet been accepted by Japan. It will be discussed this afternoon how to propose this suggestion in form. As for whether or not to consult China or its approval, it has not yet been decided. Therefore, it is not yet known when this difficulty can be resolved. (Sixth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan now seems to be able to accept the League of Nations' resolution, because there are currently only two points submitted to Japan for review, and both of these points can be resolved. The first point is the scope of authority of the investigation team. It is indeed known that the League of Nations has already recognized Japan's position on this matter, but it is asking Japan to propose another plan. The second point is the matter of using force to suppress bandits. The League of Nations is roughly prepared to acknowledge the necessity of allowing Japan to freely suppress bandits, but does not want to expressly permit the use of force. It is heard that the League of Nations has therefore asked Arita to make another reservation on this matter and not insist on including this point in the text of the resolution or in the chairman's declaration. It is expected that Japan can agree to this proposal, as long as China does not propose a counter-proposal to cancel Japan's reservation. (Sixth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Today, the sudden news of the resignation of Shi Zhaoji, the chief representative of China, shocked people in the League of Nations. The Secretariat immediately inquired about the situation from the Chinese delegation by telephone, but did not get a concrete answer. For a time, people were shocked and speculated. Finally, the Chinese delegation issued a statement explaining Shi's resignation and Chairman Jiang's letter of consolation, and the public's heart was settled. People in the League of Nations now believe that Shi will still stay in Paris to continue negotiations, but there is concern that Gu Weijun, the Chinese Foreign Minister, may also resign, and that Gu may insist on resigning. Today, after hearing the news of Shi's resignation, the members of the Council discussed the situation caused by this, but the members of the Council did not believe that Shi had already resigned, nor did they believe that the Nanjing government would approve Shi's resignation, because they believed that Shi's resignation would be tantamount to China abandoning its request for mediation to the League of Nations. (Fifth Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the League of Nations received the news from Nanjing that Dr. Shi and Gu had resigned, which was greatly shocked. A Reuters reporter went to Shi's hotel and learned that Shi was sleeping soundly, but Shi's son denied the resignation. The Chinese delegation initially said that the news probably referred to Shi's resignation as Foreign Minister, but then confirmed the news of his resignation as a representative. It is said that overseas Chinese in Europe had put pressure on Dr. Shi, so Shi had taken this action. Nanjing continued to send a telegram saying that Shi's resignation had not been approved, which was a great relief to the League of Nations. (Fifth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Put Forward Five Demands</p>
<p>(Paris) The Anti-Japanese Salvation Association in Europe sent a telegram saying: "Report to the national people through Shen Bao: On the night of the 4th, the Overseas Chinese Congress elected representatives to meet with Shi, demanding that he withdraw from the League of Nations. Shi refused and was beaten and injured in the eye before agreeing to telegraph the government to resign. We hope that the national people will arm themselves to resist Japan and overthrow the humiliating diplomacy to save the crisis." Signed, Anti-Japanese Salvation Association in Europe. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, the European Overseas Chinese Committee issued its declaration and Dr. Shi's letter of resignation. The declaration stated briefly that last night, the overseas Chinese held a congress in the Latin Quarter of Paris, expressing their disappointment with Dr. Shi's attitude and the League of Nations' inability to resolve the Manchurian issue, and said that five representatives were elected to meet with Dr. Shi at midnight after the meeting to hand over five resolutions. Shi hoped to reconcile the conflicting attitudes of the government and the people, so he issued a letter of resignation. Tonight, the Chinese delegation issued an article explaining the circumstances under which Dr. Shi submitted his letter of resignation at the request of the overseas Chinese representatives, which was the same as the Overseas Chinese Declaration. The five resolutions of the overseas Chinese are as follows: (1) Insist that the Japanese army withdraw completely before the start of negotiations. (2) Recognize the inspection team as inspectors, whose task is limited to monitoring the Japanese troop withdrawal and compiling a detailed register of Chinese losses for compensation. (3) Refuse to establish a neutral zone. (4) Invoke Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, or Article 16 if necessary, but not Article 11. (5) If this resolution is not satisfied, do not attend the Administrative Council meeting and withdraw from the League of Nations if necessary. The telegrams of Shi and Gu's resignation came like a bolt from the blue. However, those who are familiar with Chinese politics did not regard it as unexpected in view of China's memorandum this morning and the sudden hardening of the Chinese representatives' attitude towards the Jinzhou troop withdrawal and the Jinzhou neutral zone after receiving instructions from the Chinese government. This development can be seen as a victory for the radicals in Nanjing. Shi's gentle attitude in a very difficult situation has won universal praise. Now he probably feels that it is difficult to cope with this situation, so he has asked to resign. (Fifth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Our students in Europe held an overseas Chinese congress in Paris yesterday, with more than 300 people attending. Representatives of five people were elected on the spot to meet with Chief Representative Shi at midnight and present five requirements: (1) Require the Council to stipulate the date of troop withdrawal. (2) Require the neutral investigation team to monitor the Japanese troop withdrawal and estimate the damages that China should receive after Japan invades Chinese territory and sovereignty. (3) Require the government to reject the Jinzhou neutral zone proposal. (4) Require the government to submit Article 10 and Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to the Council. (5) If the League of Nations does not have a satisfactory solution, please ask the Chinese delegation to refuse to attend the Council meeting. If it is absolutely necessary, withdraw from the League of Nations. And ask Shi to forward the five requirements to the government. Therefore, Shi forwarded them to Nanjing at the same time and telegraphed to resign. After Shi telegraphed, someone in the Paris overseas Chinese immediately copied Shi's telegram and sent it to news reporters from various countries who were covering League of Nations news. As a result, the news spread everywhere. (Fifth Day National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the draft resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the declaration of the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Our government has repeatedly ordered Representative Shi to insist on important reservations. For example, Japan guarantees to withdraw its troops to the railway area. Regarding the so-called "railway area," China declares that it will never recognize Japan's right to station troops in that area based on any treaty or agreement. China also reserves the right to demand its withdrawal from that area. Regarding the commitment of both China and Japan to avoid escalating the situation, the Chinese government stated that this commitment on the Japanese side actually includes an obligation to prevent or assist any attempts that may cause political disputes and affect China's territorial or administrative integrity, such as instigating so-called independent movements or using lawless elements to achieve the purpose of such movements. Also, China will absolutely deny any request from Japan to exercise the police power of the Chinese authorities in Chinese territory. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The City Government sent a letter to the Japanese Consul on the 5th due to the proliferation of rumors: "Respected Sir, it is reported that thugs are scheduled to attack Chinese streets from the Japanese Concession on the sixth of this month. Although I know that such rumors are not credible, in case of accidents, please do not misunderstand, and I hope that you will quickly investigate to suppress the beginning of chaos."

Kuwashima replied in a letter on the evening of the 6th: "Respected Sir, I have received and read your letter No. 673 of December 5 regarding the crackdown on rumors. I have found that the rumors have been spreading in recent days, and people feel quite uneasy. The allegations in your letter that riots originating from the Japanese Concession will attack the Chinese side are absolutely untrue and completely fabricated. It is believed that these rumors originated from the Chinese Concession or other concessions.

<p>(Tianjin) At 8:00 a.m. on the 5th, seven Japanese armed soldiers scouted the Balitai area. At 10:15, a Japanese armored vehicle, more than 20 Japanese armed soldiers, and one machine gun arrived at the intersection of Guangda Middle School in Balitai. The Japanese soldiers gathered around the police station, intending to surround the station. The City Government was notified by telegram to inquire with the Japanese military. It was said that it was a Japanese military exercise, please do not misunderstand. The City Government said that at this time of uncertainty, please do not conduct exercises. The Japanese soldiers then went behind Nankai University and searched nearby villages and the security team, but found nothing. They also went to the front gate of Nankai University and wanted to enter and search, but the school refused. At 4:00 p.m., a Japanese officer, a veteran, and two attendants went to ask to visit the school. Fu Xiyong was sent to guide the visit. The Japanese soldiers discovered that the school had more than 10 security team members stationed there and reported to the military. Kashi immediately protested to the City Government. The City Government agreed to withdraw the security team immediately. Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, visited the Japanese Consul to protest, saying that if he ordered the City Government to withdraw the school's security team, the Japanese Consul would be fully responsible for any harm or loss to the school. The Japanese Consul knew that he was unreasonable and agreed to order the Japanese military to withdraw the protest. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Students of National Central University See Off Zhu Jiahua</p>
<p>Demonstration Group Resolves to Issue Appeal to the People</p>
<p>Central News Agency Reporter Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Chiang Orders Chen Daqi to Console Students</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiahua, President of National Central University, submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education on the 5th, stating that at 10:00 AM that day, a demonstration was held by students from outside the university near the campus, which resulted in a clash with military police. Coincidentally, students from the university were leaving campus for lunch, and several were caught in the fray. Consequently, in the afternoon, students of the university spontaneously gathered for a demonstration. While marching in a group in front of the Nanjing High Court, a few students rushed directly to the President's office and the Secretary-General's office on the second floor, wielding wooden planks, broken bricks, and stones. Upon encountering Guo Xinshong, Professor and Secretary-General, they immediately launched a violent assault, injuring his head. He was sent to Gulou Hospital for treatment. Considering that the actions of the students of the university were evidently manipulated by a small number of students, defying repeated admonitions, and resulting in outrageous behavior, even to the extent of assaulting teachers, and that the violent assault on Secretary-General Guo was perpetrated by a few unruly students at the highest institution of learning, National Central University, it is especially shocking. With the school discipline broken to this extent, it is truly unsustainable, all due to the President's daily mismanagement. In addition to investigating the three unruly students and handling them according to the law, I respectfully request that the negligent circumstances be forwarded to the National Government, first approving my resignation and awaiting punishment. I am filled with fear and await orders. On the same day, a public notice was issued stating that during the student gathering and demonstration, a few students violently assaulted Secretary-General Guo, causing serious injuries. Such behavior not only places the perpetrators within the reach of the law, bringing blame upon themselves, but also damages the reputation of the university and corrupts its discipline, affecting all students. Considering that the university is the highest institution of learning and its reputation is of concern to the capital, it is imperative that students, who should be abandoning disrespect for law and order and insulting their teachers, and who should be accumulating knowledge, cultivating character, and upholding morality, should not engage in such behavior. The President of the university loves and protects the students like family and children and will certainly not sit idly by while students break the law without attempting to correct them. In addition to the three students who assaulted Secretary-General Guo, who have violated criminal law and should be investigated and handled according to the law, this notice is hereby issued for the students' information. Hereafter, it is hoped that everyone will adhere to established norms, understand their roles, and refrain from engaging in excessive or transgressive behavior, and that classes will resume immediately to maintain the progress of their studies. It is greatly hoped. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Education received a telegram from Jiang Menglin on the 6th, stating that this time, the Peking University students went south, and Menglin's dissuasion was ineffective. Reading the newspaper, it was reported that the students' actions in Beijing recently have exceeded the norm. Menglin's guidance has been lacking, so I request that a clear order be issued for my dismissal and investigation. Before receiving orders, school affairs will continue to be maintained as usual. In addition to telegraphing the National Government, this telegram is respectfully submitted. (6th dispatch)</p>

The representatives insisted on their original proposal. Bao and others then went to the garrison headquarters to report, and it is heard that there will be concrete measures to persuade them this afternoon. (6th dispatch)</p>

Jiang telegraphed Han on the 5th, saying, "Recently, it has been heard that students from various places, including Ping, Tianjin, Ji, Xu, and Pu, are traveling in groups without tickets and behaving licentiously, obstructing transportation. Hereafter, without orders from the National Government, you must not arbitrarily allow trains to depart," etc. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, He Siyuan, the Director of the Education Department, Wen Chenglie, the Mayor of Jinan, and Lei Taiping, the Commander of the Jinan Garrison, arrived at the station to announce Jiang's telegram, advising the students to send a small number of representatives to Nanjing to petition or to telegraph their petition's purpose to the Central Government, with the telegraph fee paid by Han. However, the students insisted on going to Nanjing as a whole. Han then told He, Lei, and Wen by telephone, saying, "North-south transportation must be restored by 12:00 AM on the 6th, and troops will be sent to protect the station's offices. Anyone who obstructs the departure of trains will be severely punished," etc. The students resolved to adhere to their original proposal and stay at the station. (6th dispatch)</p>

<p>Representative Shi was entrusted by our nation and its people to attend the League of Nations and negotiate on our behalf. For the past seventy days, he has fought alone, enduring hardships and demonstrating exceptional ability, which has been admired by the Chinese people. Today, although justice is declining and the future is fraught with danger, leading to extreme difficulties in coping, resulting in a pessimistic attitude, this is human nature and deserves our deep sympathy. However, on the day when the nation is facing difficulties, the only responsibility of the people is to strive forward, not to be passive, but to overcome obstacles and advance, never to shrink from difficulties and shirk responsibility. Therefore, at this critical moment, the people entrust the life of the nation and the race entirely to Representative Shi. Since Representative Shi has undertaken this heavy task, there is no justification for resignation at this time.</p>
<p>We truly know that today justice has been submerged by violence, and that the League of Nations has in fact succumbed to Japan. We share the eternal sorrow of weak nations having no diplomacy. However, with a firm stance and based on established facts, we must loudly proclaim to the world and fight to the death against violence, so that the world knows that justice can be hijacked by violence, but it cannot be subjugated by violence. The Chinese nation still possesses an indomitable spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the only backing for diplomacy is public sentiment. Today, public sentiment in our country is remarkably unified. The insistence that there be no negotiations with Japan until its troops are withdrawn is unanimous and unwavering. This firm and fervent public sentiment is a powerful support for diplomacy. Representative Shi must pay attention to accepting and upholding the public opinion of the people in determining the direction of diplomatic negotiations. Diplomacy may fail, but the principle must be consistently upheld. The boiling blood of the Chinese people today will not allow Representative Shi to be trapped in a lonely struggle. If Representative Shi resigns because the principle cannot be upheld, then the resignation has meaning. But if he resigns because the environment is difficult, then the resignation is a shirking of responsibility, a betrayal of the nation and its people.</p>
<p>General Zhan Shan, the solitary army in the isolated region of Heilongjiang, has been fighting against the violent army from beginning to end. Despite the defeat at Qiqihar, he is still making persistent efforts, undaunted and unyielding, and is actively preparing to counterattack and recover the lost territory. We sincerely hope that Representative Shi will also maintain this attitude of responsibility and perseverance. We dare to tell Representative Shi that the people of our country are now prepared to fight to the death for the survival of the nation. When diplomacy reaches the point where no concessions can be made, it will be the time for the final struggle of our people, and we will never allow the responsible representative to be trapped in a lonely struggle. Representative Shi, strive forward!</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3 id="e19">Ministry of Propaganda Hosts News Reporters <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bulei Grieves Over Student Actions</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang Reports on Recent Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department hosted the news media at the second conference hall of the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 6th. About 50 reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and resident reporters from other places attended the meeting. Chen Bulei and Cheng Tianfang, the two ministers of the Central Propaganda Department, as well as secretaries Zhu Yunguang and Fang Zhi, were present. After Chen Bulei, the chairman, respectfully read the Premier's will, he reported on the recent situation of students petitioning in Nanjing. (1) The Central Government's policy toward the student movement is entirely based on the attitude of parents and elder brothers towards their children, cherishing them from beginning to end and never abandoning the responsibility of discipline. As for national laws and social order, we will certainly maintain them with all our strength. This is the consistent attitude of the government. (2) On the 5th, a portion of the Peking University demonstration group was sent to Xiaolingwei for temporary residence. The government's intention was to temporarily isolate them, like parents disciplining their children, to prevent their actions from affecting other children. This is because the various remarks and actions expressed by the group after arriving in Nanjing were completely different from those of previous students who had come to Nanjing to petition. However, the government did not conduct a serious interrogation of them. On the one hand, their food, clothing, and shelter were taken care of as usual. On the other hand, President Jiang Menglin was urgently telegraphed to come to Nanjing to lead them back to school. However, President Jiang telegraphed back that he was temporarily unable to come to Nanjing. The authorities, believing that the students should not neglect their studies for too long, prepared vehicles for them on the evening of the 5th to send them north, but it is heard that they have not yet departed. (3) Recently, students from various places have shown signs of unrest. This may be due to diplomatic tensions, but the government has clearly announced its policy. The doubts caused by previous internal and external misinformation should be swept away. How could the National Government under the guidance of the Kuomintang of China commit any act of national humiliation or betrayal that would lead to its own demise? The various expressions of students from various places seem to suggest that under the name of patriotism, anything can be done. This painful phenomenon is the result of decades of maleducation and cannot be blamed on anyone, but we cannot shirk the responsibility of correcting it. When young people's emotions are agitated, their thinking becomes simpler and simpler. They often only care about actions and forget their goals, completely ignoring the seriousness of the results of their actions. For example, the purpose of expressing the patriotic movement is nothing more than to deal with foreign countries, but as in the recent phenomenon, students stay in school but do not attend classes, and even beat people at will. In Beiping, Jinan, and other places, students demand vehicles to go south and refuse to leave the station, disrupting transportation on the Pingpu Railway. Will such phenomena not cause the enemy to laugh at us for having domestic order in chaos before foreign aggression? What benefit will such a way of loving the country bring to the country? The misuse of young people's energy is the greatest loss to the country. It is hoped that the media will implement the responsibility of guidance and promote the self-awareness of young people, etc. Next, Cheng Tianfang reported on recent diplomacy, briefly stating that in the past week, the atmosphere of the League of Nations and the attention of all parties in the country have been focused on China's three issues: one is the issue of establishing a buffer zone in Jinzhou, the second is the Tianjin incident, and the third is direct negotiations between China and Japan. The course of these three events has been seen in the talks and statements by responsible parties published in various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai on the 5th, and the truth can be made clear. What we should know is that Jinzhou is the location of the temporary government of Liaoning Province, and Tianjin is the location of the government of Hebei Province. Their status is not just that of ordinary cities. The government cannot easily withdraw and hand over the central枢紐 of a province's government decrees. If Jinzhou and Tianjin are attacked, the government has the determination to resist and defend itself. This can be responsibly told to everyone. As for the claim of direct negotiations, it is because Japanese Minister Shigemitsu came to Nanjing to congratulate Minister Gu and had two meetings with him, leading to speculation that China and Japan had begun negotiations. We believe that under the current National Government, there is no possibility of secret direct negotiations to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue. You can also rest assured about this. The League of Nations has been in session for three weeks, and a new resolution has been drafted. The most important points are three: (1) The resolution of September 30 remains in effect; (2) Five inspectors from neutral countries are sent to Northeast China for inspection; (3) Another meeting will be held on January 25 next year, but the chairman is requested to pay attention to the issue of Northeast China at any time and may convene a meeting in advance if necessary. In addition, there are two points worth noting in the introduction by Chairman Briand: (1) It is hoped that Japan will quickly fulfill the resolution of September 30 and withdraw its troops to the railway zone; (2) A small number of bandits in Northeast China are endangering the lives and property of the local people (including Japanese residents). Before the withdrawal of Japanese troops, they may take police measures when necessary to protect the safety of Japanese residents. This resolution has neither clearly stipulated the deadline for Japan's withdrawal nor recognized the Japanese army's right to suppress bandits, which is not satisfactory to the Chinese people. The government and Representative Shi are still fighting for it, and the Japanese side is not satisfied with the new resolution either. They believe that the resolution of September 30 should not be mentioned again, and that Japan should not only have police measures but also require the right to military action. Therefore, whether this resolution can be passed unanimously is still a question. However, the government has made up its mind to resist Japan's violence and will never give in. Although the League of Nations seems to be softening its attitude, Japan's unreasonable behavior is causing the world to take notice, which may not be beneficial to Japan in the end. Germany before the European War can serve as a warning to Japan. It is hoped that the country will achieve unity, that the people will trust the government, that there will be no unnecessary disputes, and that efforts will be made to prepare for external resistance. It is especially hoped that the press will uphold justice and lead the people to this goal. The meeting was adjourned after the report. (6th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Large Quantities of Silver Dollars Shipped to Dalian</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Banking circles have learned that Japanese merchants are secretly purchasing our country's currency in Shanghai, Hankou, and other ports in an attempt to shake the monetary system. Although the Ministry of Finance has issued orders prohibiting the export of silver, their conspiracies and tricks are difficult to prevent. On the morning of the 4th, a Japanese ship arrived in Dalian from Shanghai, carrying 50 boxes of our country's currency, each box containing 30,000 yuan, totaling 1.5 million yuan. The Japanese authorities in charge of the port secretly ordered all parties and the press not to disclose this matter, under penalty of severe punishment. Therefore, few people outside know about it (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles have learned that since the Northeast Incident, the price of Japanese gold notes in China has plummeted, and the losses have been enormous due to the falling price of gold worldwide. Moreover, Chinese merchants refuse to accept them when purchasing raw materials and goods, so they are using the depreciated gold notes to purchase large quantities of Chinese silver dollars and are broadly purchasing banknotes from various banks, using the banknotes to absorb raw materials. Their purpose is to: 1. Completely flood the Chinese market with banknotes from Chinese banks; 2. Completely absorb Chinese silver dollars into Japanese financial institutions, making it impossible for Japan to use gold notes to purchase large quantities of raw materials and cash. It is reported that all silver coin merchants in the country are paying close attention to this matter (6th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Gandhi Arrives in Paris from England, Speaks on Freedom and Peace <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 6th: Gandhi delivered a speech in Paris yesterday to an extremely crowded audience. He stated that his desire is to see the nations of the world enjoy the blessings of peace and freedom. As for the art of governance, if it is based on virtue rather than force, it can achieve persuasion without destruction, which is the strongest, most effective, and most humane course of action in the world. He spoke of France's motto of liberty, equality, and fraternity, saying that France is commendable for practicing what it preaches. He also stated that his trip to England yielded nothing, but it is not impossible that the British people will feel our pain and change their minds in a short period of time. Therefore, hope is not yet lost.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Gandhi, as usual, boarded a boat wearing coarse cloth today to cross the English Channel to tour Europe before returning to India. This afternoon, many British and Indian people saw him off at Victoria Station, many of whom were wearing the popular "Gandhi hats." Gandhi then traveled in third class to Folkestone. His parting words were: "If I must fight the people of England, it will not be out of resentment but out of love, and it will be like fighting with my dearest relatives. Therefore, I am determined to continue to cooperate to the best of my ability, and to measure it by what is suitable for national self-respect." When Gandhi boarded the boat to Boulogne at Folkestone, there was a large crowd watching, just as there had been when Gandhi landed at Dover a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 5th: Gandhi, returning to India from England, passed through Paris and arrived here at 4:00 PM today. He will depart for Geneva at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 5th: It is widely rumored here that Gandhi may take the opportunity of visiting Rome to meet with the Pope. The Catholic Church has a great deal of interest in India, and this statement seems credible.</p>

<p>Famous Church Demolished</p>
<p>Labor Mansion Rebuilt</p>
<p>National Society, Moscow, 5th: The new Soviet Russian railway line, built from the Altai Mountains to Kuznetsk, the new industrial hub of Siberia, opened to traffic on the 1st of this month. The line ends in Temirtau, the mining hub in the Altai Mountains, and its main purpose is to transport ore to Kuznetsk's smelters. Construction began three years ago. Due to the need to tunnel through several mountains and build six large bridges, the project was arduous but has now been completed. Reuters, Moscow, 6th: The famous Cathedral of Christ the Saviour here was destroyed by explosives today to build a giant labor mansion on its site. Architects from all over the world will compete for the design of the building. The cathedral was built in 1881 at a cost of 1.6 million English pounds to commemorate Napoleon's defeat. The artworks in the cathedral were removed and placed in various museums long ago.</p>

<p>The Course of US Counselor's Inspection</p>
<p>Datushan Correspondence: The inspection delegation specially dispatched by the embassies of various countries in Peiping has already gathered in Jinzhou. The members of the delegation include: US Counselor Orde, British Consul Morse, Counselor Daranyi, Stewart, French Consul Rambiss, Air Force Attaché Fetter, Counselor Yankewei, German Councilor Curlebault, etc. Two representatives were elected by the whole country, one being US Counselor Orde and the other being German Councilor Curlebault. They departed by special train on the night of the 1st of this month to inspect the areas east of Datong Line and Datushan, where Chinese and Japanese troops had recently engaged in fierce fighting, as well as the west of the Liao River. Previously, the Northeast Commander's Office stationed in Jinzhou had specially dispatched a platoon of guards to protect the train, and Zhu Guangmu and Cai Yuan (currently the Director of the Finance Bureau of Peiping City) accompanied them to receive and entertain them. When the train arrived at Datushan, they split up. German Councilor Curlebault, accompanied by Zhu Guangmu and Cai Yuan, went to the Datong Line, turned back at Zhangwu, and returned to Jinzhou via Datushan by the original train at 11:00 PM on the 2nd. US Counselor Aldrich boarded a train from Datushan eastward at 5:30 AM on the 2nd. Fearing that it would cause a misunderstanding by the Japanese army, he left the guards at Datushan. Mr. Orde only took one guide. When the train reached Tangjiawopu Station, because Bridge No. 31 between Tangjiawopu and Lijiawopu was bombed and broken, he changed to the electric pressure car of the railway engineering office and proceeded to the bombed bridge to inspect it in detail. Only the length of the iron rail was intercepted, but the damage was very serious. He continued to Lijiawopu Station, where he saw several lines of black characters on the wall of the stationmaster's office room: "November 27, Showa 6, Japanese Empire 4th Brigade Infantry 5th Regiment 6th Company, 2nd Lieutenant Suzuki Hiroshi and 41 soldiers occupied, Japanese Empire Banzai, First Squad, Written by Yamaguchi." On the easternmost stone step of the station platform, there was a bomb crater left by a Japanese plane, about one foot deep. Outside the signaling post east of the station, Railway Bridge No. 32 was bombed and broken. On the bridge, there was an empty car No. 36 slightly leaning, with the front wheels suspended in the air and the rear wheels still on the rails. He continued for about two miles to Bridge No. 33, which was also bombed and broken. East of the bridge, there was a car from the railway engineering office in Huanggu Village with a material car. Next to it, there were two British engineers and fifty workers who were moving materials and equipment in preparation for repairing the bridge. With the permission of the engineer, Mr. Orde abandoned the electric pressure car and took the engineer's office car to the east. When he arrived at Raoyanghe Station, he learned that it was the site of fierce fighting that day, so he inspected it in detail. Railway Bridge No. 36, east of the platform, had been bombed and broken and has now been repaired. He boarded the train again and continued to Baiqibao Station. The stationmaster claimed that a Japanese troop train was coming from the previous station, so he stopped the train to wait. After about two hours, the troop train entered the station. There were a total of three cars in the train, one locomotive, one water tank, and one third-class South Manchurian car. There were 52 Japanese soldiers carrying four machine guns. After getting off the train, they acted as if they were searching. An officer spoke to Mr. Orde in English, claiming that there were too many bandits here, so they were specially dispatched to suppress them. At the same time, they cut off five telegraph wires as an excuse. Mr. Orde asked the stationmaster if there was any bandit alarm. The stationmaster replied that there were no bandits. This shows the ambition of the Japanese army, using bandit suppression as a cover. Mr. Orde carefully examined the machine guns carried by the Japanese army, which were made by the Fengtian Arsenal. Then, he boarded the train again and continued to Liuhegou Station and arrived at Xinmin. Mr. Orde got off the train and inspected the place in detail. There were about 300 Japanese soldiers stationed at the station and in the surrounding area and in various agencies in the city. They paid close attention to his actions, but did not interrogate him. A South Manchurian car was parked at the station (one locomotive, one water tank, and five passenger cars), with a Japanese stationmaster. Mr. Orde continued to Juliaohe Station. There was also a Japanese stationmaster at that station. East of the station is the Liao River Railway Bridge, with Japanese bunkers to the east of the bridge, surrounded by five rows of barbed wire, and 150 Japanese troops stationed there. After Mr. Orde finished inspecting, he boarded the train and returned to Xinmin. The train stopped at the station and Mr. Orde stayed in the car. At 5:00 AM on the 3rd, the original car returned to Raoyanghe and he transferred to the electric pressure car back to Tangjiawopu. He boarded the train back to Datushan at 9:50 AM and reported to Counselor Ma in Jinzhou by long-distance telephone. At 10:10 AM, Mr. Orde and the guards dispatched by the Commander's Office returned to Jinzhou by the original train. (December 4)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Peiping-Tianjin Reporter Group's Inspection Record of Raoyang <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Passage of the Japanese Army's Bombing of the Raoyang Area Peiping Correspondence: The Peiping-Tianjin Reporter Group's inspection team of twelve people left Peiping at 8:00 PM on the first of this month and arrived at Datushan Station at 6:00 PM on the second. On the third, they went to Lijiawopu, Raoyanghe, and Tangjiawopu to inspect. The findings of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Jinzhou Provincial Government is Very Busy The reporter group boarded the Peiping-Nanjing Railway No. 101 passenger car and departed from Peiping at 8:00 PM on the first. At 11:20 PM that night, they arrived at Tianjin. Wang Fengrui, the chief of the engineering office of the Peiping-Nanjing Railway Bureau, was inspecting the details of the damage caused to the road by the Japanese army. He boarded the train with the Tianjin reporters from the old station and went east. In addition to the twelve members of the reporter group and the engineering personnel sent by the railway bureau to Guanwai, there were very few passengers. At 1:30 PM on the second, they arrived in Jinzhou. During the train's stop, the reporters got off the train and went to visit the Liaoning Provincial Government, which was located inside the Jiaotong University in Jinzhou. The reporters submitted their cards to Secretary-General Huang Jianqiu, who kindly received them. According to Huang, the local area of Jinzhou is still quite peaceful. All the affairs of the provincial government are being newly arranged, so they have been busy every day since its establishment two months ago. Up to now, all administrative matters have been roughly on track. A few days ago, the Japanese army suddenly advanced westward from Jiliuhe. At that time, the magistrate of Xinmin County was kidnapped by the Japanese army, but he managed to escape and has now arrived here. When the Japanese army attacked Raoyanghe, fortunately, our Zhongshan armored car prevented them from crossing west of Tangjiawopu. Thirteen Japanese planes and two armored trains bombed our armored car. Our armored car bravely responded and the Japanese army retreated. Although the Japanese army has not attacked westward in recent days, there are still four or five planes every day that come to reconnaissance around Goubangzi and Jinzhou. The Japanese army in Yingkou also crossed the river northward to Tianzhuangtai and Panshan to invade under the guise of target practice. Later, because the Japanese army on the Peiping-Nanjing Line withdrew, the Japanese army in that area also retreated to Yingkou. The reporters resigned and boarded the train eastward, arriving at Datushan at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Japanese Troop Train Comes to Patrol English Counselor Aldwell also arrived at Datushan on the morning of the second. He met with Section Chief Mao of that section and went east to inspect past Tangjiawopu. Because Bridges No. 31, 32, 33, and 36 were all bombed and destroyed, the train could not enter. He changed to a press-gate car to continue east. After stopping briefly at Lijiawopu, he continued east. At 2:00 PM, he arrived at Raoyanghe Station. He then split up to investigate. According to the investigation, a column of armored train and a column of troop train from Jiliuhe were ordered to advance westward on the morning of the 27th. In addition to carrying artillery, the two trains also carried machine gun teams, infantry, cavalry, etc., totaling more than 500 people. At 8:00 AM, they passed Baiqibao Station. The stationmaster of that station did not know that the Japanese army intended to attack, and in order to prevent danger from occurring on the road, he asked the Japanese troop train for a road pass. The Japanese soldiers ignored him and continued to drive east. The stationmaster of that station, seeing this situation, knew that the Japanese army's intentions were not good, and immediately sent telegrams to Raoyanghe and Lijiawopu stations to report the situation of the Japanese troop train without a road pass seizing the road to advance westward.

<h3 id="e69">Part of the Japanese Illegal Pending Cases (1) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese had previously boasted of over three hundred pending cases. Our newspaper has tried to find and record the gist of them. In reality, what they call pending cases are only a few dozen cases, mostly based on strong-arming and unreasonable facts. The rest are trivial matters. Now, by comparing the Japanese illegal pending cases obtained from our investigation, the brutality and unreasonableness of the Japanese are clearly and firmly evidenced.</p>

<p>(39) Case of Japanese Military Exercises in the Tumen River (August, Year 20 of the Republic)</p>
<p>The case of withdrawing Japanese police from Japanese consulates in China: From the first year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, when China and Japan signed the Tumen River boundary treaty, Japanese consulates in the open trading ports of Yantou were equipped with one or two Japanese police officers. After the fourth year of the Republic, each of these Japanese consulates even added judicial police officers, up to twenty or thirty people. By the ninth year of the Republic, there were as many as 400 Japanese police officers stationed in the inland areas of Yanbian, causing repeated incidents. Negotiations with the Japanese consuls for withdrawal at any time were unsuccessful. Since the twelfth year of the Republic, Japanese police officers have also been found in the streets and stations of Harbin, and two police stations have been established, with a total of about 50 officers and police. Negotiations by the negotiators there have not resulted in withdrawal. Since the return of Qingdao to China, the Japanese consulate has also been equipped with more than 60 police officers who wear uniforms and carry knives, patrolling the streets. Negotiations for withdrawal have also been unsuccessful. Our side believes that the arbitrary establishment of Japanese police officers in Japanese consulates in China is a disregard for our country's administrative sovereignty, and we have repeatedly approved the consultation of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to negotiate with the Japanese ambassador on May 30 of the 19th year to request immediate withdrawal. However, the Japanese side stated that the dispatch of these Japanese police officers is actually for full protection and to maintain Japanese residents. In order to avoid misunderstandings between Chinese officials and civilians, they will limit the wearing of uniforms except when necessary, but they do not mention the withdrawal at all.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Suzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Robbery cases frequently occur in the urban and rural areas of Wuxian County. Recently, robbery cases have been frequently reported in various cities and towns in Wuxian County. The water and land police are unable to quell them. In recent days, robbery cases have also occurred continuously in the urban area. A robbery case at Zhang Fushun Rice Store outside Jinmen had just occurred when a street robbery involving gold jewelry occurred at the entrance of Mitang Oil Mill the next day. On the same day, three bandits armed with weapons attempted to rob Xu Bangyu's home in Xijin Bridge. Fortunately, Xu escaped through the back door and shouted loudly for help. The bandits, realizing the situation was unfavorable, fled immediately. However, the bandits in various robbery cases all wore gray or yellow short clothes and had symbols. They were armed with pistols or Mauser pistols. The Public Security Bureau is trying to arrest them, but in reality, it feels very difficult.

<p>Another case against a party committee will be heard in court. Shi Minyong, the former supervisory committee member of the county party headquarters, was accused of fraud and financial embezzlement. The Wuxian District Court has repeatedly questioned him in court and acquitted Shi Minyong on the 4th of this month. Now, the executive committee member Shen Zuguang has repeatedly been accused by Gu Yushang, the former judge of this county, and Yao Yuren, a student from Shanghai University of Law and Politics, to the High Court for obstructing official duties. The Wudi Court had been designated to hold a hearing. Shen Zuguang believed that this case was a dispute over the previous murder case outside Ximen, which was a party action and not a personal matter. Therefore, he returned the summons to the plaintiffs and requested that the case be detained. Now, the Wudi Court has set the 10th of this month to hold a hearing for questioning. The summons has been sent to the county for delivery but has not been read. Whether Party Committee Member Shen will comply with the summons and appear in court this time is unknown.</p>

<p>Disputes over the silk factory trade union's audit of accounts. The silk factory industrial trade union in this county had not audited its finances for a long time, leading to many rumors in various factories. Therefore, it organized an economic audit committee to be responsible for the audit and appointed Wang Shihe, Chen Mengqi, Wang Xiubao, and other nine people as committee members. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives from various factories held a joint meeting at the guild hall on the Bo'an to report the results of the audit to the general meeting. The audit committee reported that Hui Jizhi, the former managing director, had embezzled public funds. The entire venue was in an uproar. Subsequently, all the representatives decided to petition the county party headquarters and request: (1) Based on the audit committee's report, Hui Jizhi, the former managing director, had embezzled several thousand yuan through corruption. They requested his removal from office and investigation. (2) The memorial hall tarnished the funds given by the capitalists. Hui Jizhi took the liberty of transferring them to the construction of the guild hall. The construction cost of the guild hall was 27,000 yuan, but it has now been used up to 40,000 yuan. They requested an immediate investigation and the recovery of the wages borrowed from female workers in April. Li Deying and Wang Huilan were appointed as the chief representatives of the petition, and they, along with more than 100 representatives, went to the county party headquarters to petition. Wang Ciqing, the chief secretary, came out to meet them. Unexpectedly, Hua Guojun, He Wei, and others pretended to be petition representatives and privately submitted a petition, intending to confuse the situation. They were immediately exposed by Li Deying and others, the chief representatives of the petition. When they realized that their plan had been revealed, Hui Jizhi took back the petition. Chen Mengqi tried to snatch it back but was beaten by the other side. Fortunately, Wang Ciqing intervened and mediated, and the incident did not escalate. The petition representatives then stated their intentions. Comrade Wang promised to forward the petition to the committee members for review and asked them to submit a supplementary petition for discussion at a meeting.</p>
<p>Singing Tanhuang, Assaulting Police, and Seizing Guns. Liu Shide, the chief of the eighth branch of the Public Security Bureau of Zhouxin Town in the third district, had previously (on the 5th) received a report from Qian Qiwen, an official from the nearby 13th district office, stating that the continuous singing of flower drum Tanhuang in the Dongjia Bang area near Meng Lane in the district was harmful and vulgar. He requested that the police be dispatched to investigate and prohibit it. After receiving the report, Chief Liu dispatched police officer Pu Xia and 18 other police officers, including Liu Yuting, with guns to investigate and prohibit it at 8:00 PM that night. Unexpectedly, the villagers, upon seeing the police arrive, without asking any questions, shouted loudly and attacked. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the police fired warning shots into the sky to deter them. However, the villagers still did not disperse and seized a rifle held by police officer Liu Yuting. He was also severely injured in the head and waist. Zhu Fusheng was thrown into the river, and Zhang Guorui was injured in the right eye. Police officer Cao Xia was able to avoid the beating by hiding in the river. Police officer Cao and others escaped to the Chenlongcang Bridge area, hired a boat, and sent the injured police officer to the bureau for investigation. It was also reported that the leaders of this Tanhuang performance were the village head and the Tuzheng of the area. The County Public Security Bureau has ordered the arrest of the ringleaders to be sent to the County Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Provincial order to borrow 80,000 yuan for water transport. The Wuyi County Government and the Finance Bureau received a provincial order to raise 80,000 yuan for winter water transport. Yesterday, they convened various township supervisors to discuss the matter. At that time, it was decided to allocate the amount according to the amount of silver taxed in each district, with each supervisor borrowing and raising funds to be paid in full by the 25th of this month. Orders were also issued to the district chiefs and township heads to assist in the process. In addition, the collection of taxes for the lower season this year has been open for a long time, but the amount collected is not strong. It has been decided to follow the rules of the deliberation plan in order to collect and remit taxes in advance.</p>
<p>A nephew strangled his uncle to death. Wu Shengbao of Changsheng Township in the fourth district of Wuyi County had a few acres of thin land and had no parents, wife, or children. The night before, he was suddenly strangled to death, and his body was moved and hung from the beam. When the villagers learned of this, they reported that the nearby security team had arrested three suspects, including Wu Tulin. Subsequently, the county court's supervising prosecutor went to the countryside to inspect the scene and confirmed that the strangulation was indeed the cause of death. The reason for the strangulation was that Shengbao intended to transfer his land to his daughter to inherit the property rights, so his nephews Tulin and others resorted to this cruel act. The supervising prosecutor is currently investigating the case.</p>

<p>An increase in vehicle fares led to a death. Zhu Shugui and his nephew Duanbao hired two rickshaws in front of Yunmen around 11:00 AM (on the 4th) to pull them to the Dashi Lane in the city to the home of Lu Ziqing at No. 18. The rickshaw pullers received 250 yuan each, but they felt it was insufficient and demanded an increase, which angered Zhu and others. They struck rickshaw puller Li Chuncheng (over 50 years old), causing his death. The other rickshaw puller, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, had already escaped. After Zhu and others killed Li, they asked the Lu family to have Xu Hengqing, a shop assistant from the Yixingsheng Rice Store next door, and Zhu Huaiyu, a shop assistant from the Chicken and Duck Shop, move the body to the Land Temple in the nearby Liansheng Lane. In an instant, the local people gathered to watch. It so happened that a relative of the deceased was also present and had seen the two shop assistants move the body. He immediately reported the incident to the police on duty, who reported it to the third sub-station of the Public Security Bureau, who in turn reported it to the court. The chief prosecutor, Zhu Ronggui, led the coroner to the scene. First, he summoned the deceased's wife, the perpetrators Zhu Shugui and Zhu Duanbao, the body movers Zhu Huaiyu and Xu Hengqing, and the related persons Lu Ziqing's mother-in-law Yao Bian, Lu Bian's maidservant Wang Chen, and Ma Hong, who lived with Lu, and other seven people for separate detention and interrogation. According to the perpetrators, Li's death was due to a self-inflicted fall. The coroner began the examination at 7:00 PM and found that the deceased had a scraped scalp on his forehead of about two inches, and his back of the head and waist were severely injured. After identification, it was confirmed that he had fallen to his death, and only the crime of moving the body by Zhu and others was to be prosecuted. The deceased's son, Deju, learned of the situation and rushed to request a re-examination, saying that his father had indeed been beaten to death. Chief Zhu immediately approved the re-examination. The results showed that there was a knife wound on the forehead and a hole in the back of the head, confirming that he had been beaten to death. He immediately instructed the Zhen Ding to guard the body, and the police took Zhu Shugui, Zhu Duanbao, the body movers Zhu Huaiyu and Xu Hengqing, and the related persons Lu Bian, Wang Chen, and other six people to the court for detention pending investigation.</p>

<p>The notorious bandit Cheng Mingyi, who escaped, was recaptured and robbed Shiwanzhen and hijacked the Xinjia Ban steamer. The notorious bandit Cheng Mingyi, who robbed Shiwanzhen and hijacked the Xinjia Ban steamer, was arrested by Captain Wang of the 13th Water Army Team last month. After being interrogated by the city's Qingxiang Bureau, he was detained in the County Public Security Bureau. A few days ago, the bandit escaped over the wall from the detention center. Chen Tiemin, the head of the Shicong Security Corps, learned that the bandit had fled from prison and was hiding in the Zongguan Temple near Lujiawan. The corps head secretly wrote to Pan Shuren, the director of the Wuxing County Public Security Bureau. After learning of the situation, Director Pan immediately sent many police officers to the area to join forces with the local security corps members. They went to the temple at 5:00 AM on the 3rd and found the bandit and a woman sleeping together. They were arrested and taken back to Huzhou for interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenyou, Liu Songyun, Wang Rongcheng, Wang Yuquan, and Fang Zhenyue, members of the Peking University Students' Demonstration Delegation, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and reported on the situation of the demonstration in Beijing as follows:</p>
<p>More than 300 members of the Peking University Students' Demonstration Delegation arrived in Nanjing and stayed in the Central University Gymnasium. After arriving in Beijing, the delegation contacted various parties and invited reporters from various newspapers and news agencies to report on the purpose of the Nanjing demonstration and the journey south. Fearing that the true situation would not be understood by all parties, the delegation sent representatives Zhang Baichuan and others to the Garrison Headquarters to report on all the procedures and routes of the demonstration before the demonstration began, and submitted a written statement to the authorities for understanding. However, the representatives did not return after going at 8:00 AM. It was not until around 11:00 AM that they had not returned. Soon, the delegation received a report from another party that the representatives who had gone to the Garrison Headquarters had been detained by the authorities. The students in the delegation were extremely angry at the time and immediately decided to have all groups and teams line up and set off for the demonstration in turn. The order was still good at the time. In addition to shouting slogans along the way after departure, the students all held small flags with slogans such as "Down with Japanese Imperialism" and "Oppose the Traitorous Government." Many students from Central University also expressed their sympathy. The delegation set off from Central University. Not far after leaving the gate, there were many police officers stationed on both sides of Chengxian Street. As the large team moved forward, the police and military police suddenly stepped forward to stop them. The propaganda team of the delegation was at the front of the team at the time, and two or three people were immediately arrested by the military police. Yue Zengyu, the commander of the large team, immediately ordered the team to stop moving forward and explained the significance of the demonstration to the military police. However, while the two sides were negotiating, five or six hundred military police officers arrived from the rear of the team and surrounded the entire team and arrested the students. The order was disrupted for a while. Because the students were surrounded from the front and back, some of them climbed over the short walls beside the street and escaped. However, there were too many military police officers, and although the students resisted slightly, no less than seventy or eighty people were injured in the chaos, including more than ten seriously injured, including one female student. Because of the panic, she fell into a ditch and was severely injured by being hit with stones from both sides. It is estimated that about 200 people were arrested by the military police at that time, including about thirty or forty female students. The escaped students all returned to Central University one after another. Except for those who were missing, there were more than seventy people remaining. After receiving the news, all the students of Central University were extremely angry and immediately convened a general meeting of all students to decide to assist the Peking University students and gathered more than 1,000 students from Central University and Peking University to go to the Garrison Headquarters under the command of the demonstration delegation and demand the immediate release of the Peking University classmates and other conditions. By 10:00 PM, the authorities had escorted the arrested students to Xiaolingwei for detention. After hearing the news, various schools in Nanjing sent representatives to express their condolences, but they were all rejected. This morning (the 6th), all the schools went to the National Government again. At the same time, the Peking University students received a telegram from the third batch of representatives of the Peking University demonstration delegation to Beijing, saying that all the students had decided to go to Beijing within days to provide assistance. The delegation also sent representatives to Shanghai to ask for assistance from various groups in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Intention of the Public Works Department to Revise the Regulations on Subsidizing Private Chinese Schools <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>丨Published by the Information Office of the Public Works Department丨</p>
<p>Focusing on the point of ethnic hatred</p>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department released a message yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>The Public Works Department hopes that private Chinese schools in the Public Concession should be made as consistent as possible with the methods of schools in various districts. Chinese children's schools not established by the Public Works Department in the Concession are almost entirely managed by the Chinese themselves. Except for the special circumstances of the Concession, they have never been subject to any restrictions. According to Chinese law, the power of jurisdiction actually lies with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. The Public Works Department recognizes both of these points. Therefore, the Public Works Department has proposed to the Mayor of Shanghai that the Bureau accepts the recommendation of the Bureau of Education to show that private schools are qualified for subsidy fees. If the Bureau of Education assumes this responsibility, 丨we hope that the Bureau will be willing to assume it,丨 the allocation and distribution of this subsidy fee will be jointly handled by the Public Works Department and the Bureau of Education, based on the report of the Chinese Committee Branch of the Education Committee of the Public Works Department and the recently approved regulations. These regulations are called "General Conditions for Chinese Schools," and their content is the same as those set by the Public Works Department for private foreign children's schools, except that the scope of implementation of the two is different.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the Public Works Department approved the listing of 150,000 taels of silver in the budget for subsidy fees for private schools. This amount has been approved by the annual meeting of taxpayers, but it has not yet been actually spent.</p>
<p>The Education Committee of the Public Works Department carefully considered the regulations on subsidy fees during drafting and translation to ensure that the meaning of the Chinese and English texts was consistent. Among them, there was originally a section on the curriculum outline, which caused great difficulty. There was concern that this would cause misunderstandings on the Chinese side. Therefore, after full discussion by the Education Committee, it was unanimously advocated to participate in the revision and modify this section as follows:</p>
<p>Article 10, Clause B: Each school should encourage students to love the country and be good citizens. Anything in the curriculum that is sufficient to hurt national feelings and cause ethnic hatred must not be used.</p>
<p>This amendment has been approved by the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>During the discussion in the Education Committee, it was stated that this clause on prohibiting curricula that are prone to cause ethnic hatred was drafted before the current political situation occurred. Therefore, this provision has absolutely nothing to do with the current situation of estrangement between the two ethnic groups in the Concession. Moreover, the Public Works Department has absolutely no intention of interfering excessively with Chinese schools. Because the Public Works Department is an administrative body in a large urban area, it is its responsibility to provide subsidy fees to private schools, and it has absolutely no intention of prohibiting patriotic actions in these schools. The Chairman of the Education Committee further stated that the establishment of this prohibition clause is because the schools are located in the international Public Concession. Therefore, the curriculum should be based on promoting international cooperation and friendship. Even in the current tense situation, the Education Committee has a good opportunity to show that patriotic actions in schools do not necessarily cause ethnic resentment. He believes that it is possible to guide children to love the country in schools without causing them to hate another ethnic group in the Concession. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e87">Record Breaking <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>| Overthrowing the record set by Yang in 1929</p>
<p>| 2 hours 29 minutes 53.8 seconds record</p>
<p>Shi Jinsheng's hard training throughout the year has resulted in rapid progress. He once set an astonishing record of 2 hours and 19 minutes during the trial run. Although he did not achieve his best result yesterday, he has overthrown the record of 2 hours 29 minutes 53.8 seconds set by the Englishman Yang in 1929. Shi's time of 2 hours 27 minutes 03 seconds has become a new record.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Course of the Struggle <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Shi Jinsheng always at the forefront</p>
<p>Champion Shi Jinsheng not only set a new record, but also remained in the lead from beginning to end. Of the more than fifty participants, only their backs could be seen. The second place was almost a mile behind, which is extremely rare.</p>
<p>Firing the gun and taking the lead</p>
<p>At 7:50, sixty-four athletes lined up in numerical order at the intersection of Carter Road. The four members of the Chinese team were in the far left corner. After roll call and arrangement, as Besley's gun fired, more than sixty pairs of flying feet started simultaneously. Shi Jinsheng and Hou Genren took the lead, heading towards Jing'an Temple, followed by Niugebao, Shipon, Kim, France, and Xie Xingdao.</p>
<p>Three abreast in front of Jing'an Temple</p>
<p>Arriving in front of Jing'an Temple, only one mile had passed. Shi Jinsheng, Niugebao, and Davis were running abreast. Fifty yards behind were Zhou Ruquan, Xie Xingdao, France, Shipon, Kim, Zhang Luzhou, Xi Lieteng, Qi Miyaning, Losi, and Hou Genren.</p>
<p>Gradually separating before Zhaofeng Garden</p>
<p>Passing Gexifei Road and reaching Xianglinan Road, passing in front of Zhaofeng Garden, the distance was three and a half miles. At that time, it was 8:20, and the positions of each person gradually became uneven. Niugebao was closely following Shi Jinsheng. Seventy yards behind, the Englishman France shrugged and advanced another thirty yards. Xie Xingdao and Zhou Ruquan came side by side, Kim, Davis, and Shipon were twenty yards further back, and Hou Genren was even further behind.</p>
<p>Taking the lead on Robegen Road</p>
<p>Along the Suzhou River, advancing in the previous formation, turning into Robegen Road, approaching the intersection of Lincoln Road, the distance was six miles, accounting for one-third of the entire course. Shi Jinsheng had already dropped Niugebao and taken the lead. Niugebao was one hundred yards behind Shi, and France was two hundred yards behind Shi. Zhou and Xie were still running side by side fifty yards away, Kim, Davis, and Shipon followed closely, and Hou Genren was still behind.</p>
<p>Tense situation on Hongqiao Road</p>
<p>After Robegen Road, turning west onto Hongqiao Road, eight miles had already been covered. At that time, the Chinese and British teams were competing fiercely, and it was difficult to predict the outcome. Zhou Ruquan had already overtaken Xie Xingdao on Robegen Road. Shi Jinsheng was still in the lead. Excluding Niugebao, the second place was France, one hundred and twenty yards away. Zhou and Xie were fifty yards apart, and Kim and Davis were eighty yards behind. Hou Genren caught up with Shipon, only five or six yards behind Davis.</p>
<p>Separately calculated, the Chinese team occupied the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 7th positions, while the British team occupied the 2nd, 5th, 6th, and 8th.</p>
<p>Hou sped up at Jiaotong University</p>
<p>On Hongqiao Road, Hou Genren accelerated and overtook Davis. Passing Jiaotong University to Haige Road, Hou again overtook Davis, trailing Xie Xingdao by thirty yards. This was twelve miles, one-third away from the finish line. Hou's efforts were key to victory. At Lafayette Road and Albert Road, Hou again overtook France, trailing Kim and ranking fourth. At Weihaiwei Road, he surpassed Kim and Zhou Ruquan, competing with Niugebao. Hou's efforts to accelerate were for the honor of the country.</p>
<p>Champion enters the arena to thunderous applause</p>
<p>Hou Genren's catch-up greatly increased the Chinese team's hope. Shi Jinsheng's first place was no longer in doubt. At around 10:27, Shi Jinsheng entered the arena amidst thunderous applause. Niugebao and Hou Genren followed one mile later, with Hou ultimately losing to Niugebao by a few steps, which was a pity. Zhou Ruquan was thirty yards behind in third place, followed by the Englishman Kim, etc. Xie Xingdao was ranked tenth. The Chinese team won the championship with fourteen points, retaining the title for the fourth time.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Chaotic Gold Market Last Week in Finance <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>American Silver Mining Group Proposes to Raise Silver Prices</p>
<p>Increased by Hundreds of Taels in the Recent Three Weeks</p>
<p>Fluctuations of More Than Forty Taels Throughout the Week Last week, the gold market situation had significant changes again, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to handle. The difference between days was more than ten to twenty taels, and the chaotic situation was ultimately unstoppable. The industry was mostly controlled by both long and short positions, but it was still in a fog. Most of the domestic and foreign news was divergent, and the overseas silver market still belonged to a different trend. The Shanghai exchange rate was tight for British and American currencies, which was due to the small exchange rate between British and American currencies. Peers sometimes colluded to offset the previous gap, which was also a hedge. Since the beginning of the week, the gold price soared from 684 taels and then broke through the 700 taels mark, and then hovered without time. A new high price of 725 taels once appeared. Finally, it suddenly broke into 700 taels. It is found that the total increase in the whole week was 41 taels. Looking back, the total increase was 31 taels and 4 qian. It has been rising for three consecutive weeks, totaling 99 taels and 9 qian. As for the Dalian gang, they took a slightly long position, while the Guangdong gang was a short position. And spot goods, because silver is in urgent need, the ability of those who bear it has decreased. Therefore, the price registered on the exchange in November and December is lower than that in January. According to the exchange, the long position is instead issued for 2 taels and 4 qian. The red-hot total increases by 5 to 6 taels. The quoted price is pressed from 80, 90, and 100 taels to 50 and 60 taels. Yesterday (6th), the large bar of silver continued to rise, and it was also heard that the American silver mining group proposed to raise the price of silver. Also, the Japanese cabinet has had new disturbances and other news. It is expected that gold coins may be affected. The following is a summary of the overview of the past week.</p>
<p>Hovering Inside and Outside the 700 Taels Mark Since the beginning of the week (November 30), the recent large bar of silver has not changed, but the far term has increased by .0625. American silver has contracted by 25 shillings, and the US dollar has contracted within 1 yuan. The internal market is also tight, and peers are busy digging, most of the standard gold opened up 15 taels and 2 qian to 684 taels and a half, followed by 4 taels, and it was said that Japan had withdrawn its troops, and the situation had turned peaceful. After a moment, it continued to rise by more than ten taels. At noon, it actually broke through 700 taels, which was the excitement of the large households who were scrambling to buy, and the shorts were in a hurry to make up. Bombay reported a small total of 702 taels and a half, and the closing price was 699 taels and 8 qian. The market opened at 707 taels in the afternoon. The Dalian gang took the lead, followed by 7 taels and a half. The momentum of disorder continued to flow downwards. Because the sellers did not slacken, the exchange rate seemed to be frustrated, so it retreated to 695 taels. It was closed at 700 taels and .002 qian, which was 30 taels and 9 qian higher than the previous Saturday. The difference between the whole day was 23 taels and a half. On Tuesday, the large bar of silver shrank by .3125, the American silver shrank by 1/100 of a shilling, but the two bridges increased by 2, and the US dollar shrank by .375. This was a small exchange rate. The standard gold opened a small amount of 1 tael and 2 qian against the tide to 699 taels. Because the large bar shrank not much, the private electricity was only .0625, but the buyers seemed to be many times at 701 taels. In an instant, large households scrambled to sell, especially because the situation was not optimistic, so it immediately fell to 91 taels and a half. Later, the Guangdong gang and others chased in, and Mr. Wu and the Dalian gang followed the purchase without slackening, and the price rose steadily. At noon, it was 701 taels and a half, and the closing price was 700 taels. The market opened at 700 taels in the afternoon, and then retreated to 92 taels and 8 qian because Bombay reported repeatedly. The closing price was 94 taels and 7 qian, which was 5 taels and a half lower than the previous day. The whole day rose and fell by 10 taels. On Wednesday, the large bar of silver rose by .4375 to half a pence. American silver increased by .125 shillings, and there were different trends of brightening and darkening. All numbers were being pegged to the US dollar, but the exchange rate was small, so the British were tight and the Americans shrunk. The standard gold opened at 91 taels, down 3 taels and 7 qian. Then, because Japan continued to transport cash, the American people turned upward, and Xin Xin Xiang Rong soared by a huge amount of more than 20 taels. At noon, it was 718 taels and 5, and then it closed at 17 taels and 8 qian. The market opened at 16 taels in the afternoon. Many sages suppressed it to 13 taels and 5 qian. Again, because Bombay reported a small amount, the buyers were still strong, and the price rose to 19 taels and 7 qian. The closing price was 16 taels and 6 qian, which was 21 taels and 9 qian higher than the previous day. The difference between the whole day was 28 taels and 7 qian, which can be called huge. On Thursday, the large bar of silver rose by .1875 to .125. American silver increased by .25 shillings, shrinking by 1/100. The internal market was tight in British currency and flat in American currency, but the exchange rate suddenly rose. Most of the gold market was at 707 taels, and it fell by 9 taels and 6 qian. In an instant, the shorts made up their positions in a big way, and the price jumped to 25 taels. Again, because Mr. Wu sold out and the Guangdong gang also sold very hard, it fell back wildly to more than 10 taels to 13 taels and a half. However, the market was extremely chaotic and suddenly jumped 7 taels to 20 taels and a half. Then, because there were more sellers, the closing price was 15 taels. The market opened at 16 taels and 5 in the afternoon, followed by 17 taels and 8 qian. It was suppressed again to 10 taels and .07 qian. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had reported a small amount of ten anna, and it reappeared at 17 taels and 8 qian. The closing price was 13 taels and a half, which was slightly smaller than the 3 taels and 1 qian of the previous day. The rise and fall of the whole day was 18 taels. On Friday, the large bar of silver fell again by .3125. The American silver did not change its shillings as before. The internal market was slightly loose, but peers were still digging. The opening price of the gold market was 709 taels, a decrease of 4 taels and 5 qian. Then, Nei Qiao and Rifufu made up their short positions and reached 17 taels. Then, because large households sold out, and it was heard that the United States maintained the exchange rate, the air in the telegram changed suddenly and deteriorated. The price fell wildly by 9 taels to .09 taels. At noon, it closed at 12 taels and 7 qian. The market opened at 16 taels and 5 in the afternoon, because it had been raised by 3 taels after the noon closing. Then, because Hengyu bought in and it was rumored that Japan had withdrawn its troops, the people were shocked and rose to 24 taels. However, the Guangdong gang, Henghing, Yifeng, Yong, and others sold on their behalf, and the market turned downwards. Then, the wind and waves became even greater. Zhongfu and other banks scrambled to sell exchange rates and receipts, because rumors were spreading and there was talk of Jinzhou being in a tight situation. The market was in a state of plunging thousands of feet, and suddenly fell by more than 20 taels, and finally closed at 700 taels and .005 qian, and the closing price was 704 taels and 4 qian, a continued drop of 9 taels and 1 qian. The difference was 23 taels and 5 qian. On Saturday, the large bar rose by .3125. The American silver did not change its shillings as before. The internal part was slightly loose. The gold market opened at 709 taels, an increase of 4 taels and 6 qian, because the situation was the opposite of the previous day. After that, it hovered inside and outside of 710 taels, and it passed 13 taels. It was rumored that Germany had changed to the silver standard, and the price plummeted by more than 10 taels. Qiao Rifufu sold out, and the price suddenly broke through 700 taels, falling to 698 taels and 5 qian. The closing price was 700 taels and .007 qian, which was 3 taels and 7 qian and a half smaller than the previous day. The difference in half a day was 14 taels and 5 qian. The following is a description of the high and low prices of the British, American, Indian silver markets and exchange rates.</p>

It is reported that the industry association has decided that the interest rate for November will be set at eleven taels. The 95% deduction is a particularly high interest rate that has not been seen in the middle of this year. The highest interest rate must be added, and the highest interest rate is of course 16 to 17 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Quiet Silver and Foreign Market on Sunday <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Li exchange rate is consistent downstream</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the banks were closed as usual. The market price of foreign currency was generally downstream. The morning market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li, and 7 hao and a half. The afternoon market was 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li, and 6 hao and a half. The result was half a li smaller than the previous day. The amount of exchange rates made was 370,000 in the morning market and 300,000 in the afternoon market. The banknotes were only 20,000 in the afternoon market. The off-market banknotes were also only 40,000 in the afternoon market. The silver borrowing rate was the same for both the morning and closing markets at 1 qian and 9 fen.

<h3 id="e96">Public Bonds Rose and Fell Last Week in Securities <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>During the past week, the market situation of various bonds in the local securities market was very deserted, and the popularity was always very cold. Every day, only the December term was stable, and although the January term has been auctioned for many days, there has been no transaction so far. It is found that the transaction volume was about 6.4 million yuan on the last day of the week, and about 5 million yuan each on Tuesday and Thursday. The remaining days were only between 2 million and 3 million yuan. According to statistics, the total transaction volume for the whole week was 24.55 million yuan, including 4.72 million yuan of general tax, 3.56 million yuan of salt tax, 3.615 million yuan of 20 customs, 2.94 million yuan of 20 volumes, 2.62 million yuan of disarmament, 2.385 million yuan of 19 customs, 2.07 million yuan of 19 charity, 1.835 million yuan of reorganization, 350,000 yuan of 6% reorganization, 280,000 yuan of 96 public bonds, and customs duty. The transaction volume was only 175,000 yuan on the last two days of the week. Although the forward market was very deserted, the spot market was quite active. There were many types of transactions opened every day, and the ins and outs were not lonely. According to statistics, the transaction volume for the whole week was 200,350 yuan, including 44,000 yuan of 20 customs, 35,000 yuan of general tax, 29,500 yuan of 6% reorganization, 30,000 yuan of 19 customs, 28,000 yuan of reorganization, 25,000 yuan of salt tax, 4,000 yuan each of 19 charity and 20 volumes, 3,000 yuan of disarmament, and 1,000 yuan of customs duty. Only 96 did not open. As for the changing situation, the rise and fall were extremely severe on Monday. The exchange has approved the order of the ministry to stipulate the minimum price limit to maintain the market, and at the same time, it has prohibited new sales transactions, so the seller is subject to absolute restrictions. It is even more heard that the Japanese are withdrawing their troops from attacking Jin, although the Tianjin news is still not calm, and the market is temporarily very excited. Investors bought in, and almost all bonds were suspended at the beginning of the morning. The only ones that were not suspended were 96 bonds. After the suspension, the price of dark trading among brokers still continued to rise. It is heard that the highest price in the dark market was as much as eight or nine yuan higher than the previous weekend. On Tuesday, the market was slightly more stable, first strong and then tired. Although the market price was still one or two yuan higher than Monday, it was already lower than the dark market. The market was stable on Wednesday, the transaction was clear, and the price rose and fell very little. However, the result still rose by several corners to one yuan. Although the loop was dull on Thursday, the exchange was about to cancel the restrictions on sales transactions, which made people feel slightly empty and the buying momentum was not strong, and the price fell by one or two yuan. On Friday, the exchange added margin and implemented the cancellation of restrictions on sales transactions. However, because there was no change in the loop, the price turned stable, and the rise and fall were intertwined. The downtrend suddenly strengthened on the last day of the week. The market was due to the government's disagreement with the League of Nations' neutral zone case, and the Japanese attitude was also very barbaric. The question of peace and unification in our country still seemed to have twists and turns, which caused the sales transactions in the market to suddenly become strong and suppress the price by two to three yuan. The trend was the most tired during the past week, but the result was that, except for a few spot prices that still fell, the others uniformly rose by about two, three, or four yuan compared with the previous week. Observing the current situation of the bond market, it has once again become chaotic, and its future is very difficult to predict. The following is a list of the high and low price increases and decreases of each bond in the past week (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e98">Grain: River Lower Rice Continues to Fall by Two Angles <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of Nantou came in an endless stream, about forty boats berthed in Pucun. Especially, the township store's appetite is rejected, and the actual edge of the silver root is bright and loose, and it is tightly embraced, so the new japonica rice market continues to fall by two angles. The early and late rice arrivals also meet the sales. If this street is still thin, Ning's appetite is also thin. The market price is also revised. The foreign sharp tip arrives and sells at a flat price without rising or falling. The change of Yin Yuan's arrival is slightly zero, and it is still possible to move the wine stomach unpleasantly, and the price remains the same.</p>
<p>The road to each file of the 37th and 38th arrivals in Xinzha is still lonely. The accumulation of river is still thick, and the top of new japonica rice is limited. The overall market is about a corner or two. The thin rice passenger gang does not move and drops a small corner. The top goods of foreign tips are lacking, and the market of Songbu tips is affected by the sharp tips of passengers, and the market falls by five points. The arrival of general changes is rare, and the sales stomach can still see the trend of fatigue.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Silk and Tea: Last week, there was still no turning point in the silk market <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Overseas actual sales are not moving... hoarders suppress prices and hoard</p>
<p>The provincial order requires silk factories to resume work... Manufacturers sell at a loss</p>
<p>Last week, there was still no turning point in the local foreign silk market. It was found that the actual sales of Lyon Hua Silk were not moving. Although the silk in London was thin, the economic situation was unstable. Silk merchants had no appetite for silk. The price of New York Japanese silk was cheap. Grade B white factory was 80 to 85 points. Yivannais telegram turned the price to only 800 to 834 taels. British hoarders took the opportunity to suppress prices and hoard endlessly. The five or six hundred packages of grade B white factory warp imported by Jardine Matheson, etc., initially opened at 834 taels, and then fell to 800 taels. The provincial order required silk factories that received silk public bonds to not stop production without reason. Those who have stopped work should immediately find ways to resume work to maintain the lives of workers. Each manufacturer needs funds for resumption of work, and it is difficult to deposit silk goods (the silk quota worth one thousand taels can only be obtained for four or five hundred taels). They had no choice but to sell at a discount. However, the loss was too great (the selling price of 800 taels per package was at least more than 200 taels). Therefore, the negotiations were still in progress last Friday and could not be fully signed and recorded. Last week, more than 500 packages of spot silk were exported, and 600 to 700 packages of spot and futures silk were traded. The price of overseas Hua Silk was still weak. The market prices of Hua Silk in the New York and Lyon markets at the end of last week are listed below (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: francs)</p>
<p>Silk Type, New York, Lyon, Silk Type, New York, Lyon</p>

<p>Yesterday, because the sugar market was on a weekday, there were no telegrams from the producing area. The market trading of the guild was sparse, and the market atmosphere was flat and tired. The transaction price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sand was 10 taels and 0.02 yuan; No. 16 medium sand white was 9 taels and 8 yuan; High No. 20 was 10 taels and 0.01 yuan. The market situation was flat. The Dutch sugar market was still stable. No. 9 goods were 8 taels and 7.5 yuan to 8 yuan; No. 10 goods were shouted at 9 taels, and the goods felt short. Taikoo sugar imports and exports were also slack. B mark was 11 taels and 8 yuan, and there was a slight transaction. The remaining marks were at lower eating prices, which led to a stalemate between the two sides. The market atmosphere was firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening price of crude lead was 14 taels and 3 yuan per load, which was a little harder than before. However, the actual transaction was not much, and people's hearts were not firm, so the market atmosphere was not very tense. It was found that only three or four hundred loads were traded in the market yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Wang Jingwei Meets with Representatives of Capital Schools <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang has instructions at Guandulu on Gordon Road</p>
<p>More than one hundred and eighty representatives of students from various schools in the capital arrived in Shanghai the night before. Yesterday morning, they sent seven representatives to the French Concession to visit Mr. Wang. It was agreed to meet all the representatives at Wu's Mansion, Guandulu, Gordon Road at 2:00 pm. The representatives were transferred to several teams by car, but due to insufficient vehicles, they did not arrive until 3:30 pm. Mr. Wang served tea and snacks. At 4:00 pm, the meeting began. After the commander-in-chief of the delegation, Wang Jianyu, explained the mission of coming to Shanghai, Mr. Wang delivered instructions until 5:00 pm. The letter of welcome from the representatives and Mr. Wang's instructions are recorded below.</p>
<p>Welcome Petition: Presenting the matter of welcoming Mr. Wang to Beijing to preside over the party and the country's major plans. I believe that the party and the country are unfortunately in successive disasters, and floods are rampant in the past. The Japanese pirates are rampant in the future. The people are already suffering from natural disasters, and the country is being invaded by whales. The rebellious flames are becoming more and more intense, and the people's hearts are panicked. The discord between Ning and Yue is difficult to achieve peace. If this continues, the country will perish without a day. Mr. Wang is an advanced leader of the revolution and leads the masses. He advocates people's governance to correct the malpractices of the times and to elaborate on people's rights. He is indignant at the imminent national crisis and embraces peace to seek unity. Our group is happy to follow. I dare to ask you to consider the difficulties of the times, to follow the public opinion, to promote the realization of peace in the shortest possible time, and to preside over the party and government in Beijing as soon as possible, to correct the accumulated malpractices of the past, to revitalize the spirit of party governance, to vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy, and to recover the lost land in the Northeast. The capital people swear to be Mr. Wang's backing, and the people of the whole country will be directed by Mr. Wang. I urge you to be aware of this. Respectfully present to the revolutionary leader Mr. Wang.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Mr. Wang Jingwei meets with representatives of Beijing schools and takes a photo (taken by this museum) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang's instructions: After the commander-in-chief of the delegation, Wang Jianyu, stated the purpose of coming to Shanghai to petition, Mr. Wang gave instructions: "Dear representatives, I feel very uneasy in my heart that you have traveled all the way from Nanjing to Shanghai. I originally wanted to entertain you at my house, but because the place is too shallow, I borrowed Wu's Mansion to meet you. The last Shanghai Peace Conference was also held here. I met with representatives of various groups in Shanghai every day. Today, I can meet with you again. Although the place is still not enough, I really want to take this opportunity to express my respect for you. I came to Shanghai this time to share the difficulties of the country. Let's look at the history of the world in the past two hundred years. In these two hundred years, I don't know how many countries in the world have perished. However, at the same time, I don't know how many countries have been able to struggle to survive despite suffering all kinds of oppression. Now China is being invaded and oppressed by Japan. Many people think that China cannot resist Japan and hold infinite pessimism about national affairs. But is this attitude right? Let's look at the history of various countries in the world. Which country has not experienced a dangerous period? For example, during the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, France was in danger of perishing at any time. The uniforms of the volunteer army are exactly the same as the volunteer army of the French people at that time. Because the French people were able to work hard, France was finally saved. Moreover, since that time, France has no longer had the struggle between the imperial system and the republic, nor the terror of Louis' restoration and Napoleon's revival of the imperial system. Now France is still a strong country in the world. Let's look at the Great Revolution in our country in the seventh year of the Republic of China. At that time, Germany took advantage of its victory and negotiated peace with Russia. The Russian government signed a humiliating peace treaty. Many people thought that Russia would perish. The Russian revolution also failed from then on. But the fact is not. Because the Russian people can fight together, Russia still survives in the world. We can also look at Germany in the eighth year of the Republic of China. At that time, after Germany was defeated, it was subjected to all kinds of oppression from various countries and was in danger of perishing at any time. But because the German people persevered and struggled, Germany was finally saved. In this way, although China is now in a dangerous period, we must have a way to save the country. However, the way to save the country must be automatically thought out by the people. This is the real way. But now there are some people who say that if the current Kuomintang government declares war on Japan and is defeated, the Kuomintang will perish. Otherwise, if the Kuomintang negotiates peace with Japan, it can be accused of selling out the country and will also perish. But those who say these words will never do so if they are patriotic people. Because when the country is in trouble, no one should use diplomacy to deal with internal affairs. So to the outside of the party, so to the party, just as a faction of comrades who work with the brothers have always opposed the Nanjing government, but from beginning to end they have opposed the Nanjing government in order to realize the fifth political system. They will never use the problem of diplomacy as a tool for internal struggle. As for the current diplomatic methods, I think there are eight words: "Resist on the one hand and negotiate on the other." We must know that Japan's dispatch of troops this time is not tolerated by the international community. On the one hand, it violates the League of Nations, and on the other hand, it violates the Non-War Pact. I remember that during the war between Germany and France in the third year of the Republic of China, Germany's dispatch of troops passed through Belgium and destroyed Belgium's neutrality, so Britain came to attack Germany. Moreover, Japan's dispatch of troops to the Northeast this time is even more unreasonable than Germany's dispatch of troops to Belgium. Therefore, for the sake of their own national glory and for the sake of maintaining world peace, all countries must intervene. But if China declares war on Japan, the situation will be different. They can all remain neutral. It should be noted that not declaring war does not mean not resisting. Japan's actions this time are like robbers openly robbing. If we encounter robbers breaking into the house, the only way is to face him head-on while ringing the alarm to cooperate in catching them. Therefore, I advocate that we must resist on the one hand and negotiate on the other. If we can do so, we will not be absolutely disappointed. The current organization of volunteer troops everywhere is an expression of working together to overcome the difficulties of the country. Some people think that the current volunteer troops are not well trained and have insufficient guns. How can they be helpful? In fact, this is not the case. Because although the volunteer troops are not perfect in material terms, their spirit is very valuable. At least, it must be able to arouse the attention of the people of the whole country and make them all have the determination to resist by force. If this is the case, the country will definitely be able to have the final rescue. Regarding the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou and the joint management of Tianjin, I remember that at the time of the Peace Conference, there were diplomatic principles and policies that were agreed upon by both parties and negotiated by the Nanjing government. Therefore, after I heard the news that a neutral zone was established in Jinzhou and a joint management area in Tianjin, I immediately sent a telegram to Nanjing to inquire. Although I have not received a reply to this day, Mr. He Jingzhi and Mr. Shao Lizi came to Shanghai from Nanjing today to explain this matter. It is said that there is no such thing as establishing a neutral zone in Jinzhou and jointly managing Tianjin, so we can rest assured. Regarding my trip to Nanjing, this may be realized in the near future. Originally, after the Peace Conference, everyone decided to send Sun, Li, and Chen back to Guangdong, and I, Wu, and Zou would stay in Shanghai to wait for the future results. Now the Fourth National Congresses of Nanjing and Guangzhou have elected the Fourth Central Committee members. The Shanghai delegates have also completed the election. Now we are only waiting for them to arrive from Guangzhou, then I can go to Nanjing with them. Our purpose in going to Nanjing is to share the difficulties of the country externally and to realize democratic politics internally. Sharing the difficulties of the country and realizing democratic politics is actually only one thing. Because only with democratic politics can the people have the possibility of sharing the difficulties of the country. Now the comrades in Guangzhou are about to set off tomorrow and will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. Then the date when I meet you in Nanjing will not be far away. Today, I fully accept your enthusiasm for coming to Shanghai this time and express my deepest respect to you."</p>

<p>Chen Zhenru inquired about the election situation in Guangzhou</p>
<p>Shao He reported the recent diplomatic truth</p>
<p>He Yingqin, Shao Lizi, and Chen Mingshu visited Shanghai yesterday before and after the visit of Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei. Chen visited Wang in the morning on the election of members of the Central Committee in Guangzhou and Shanghai and diplomatic questions. Chen Mingshu visited Wang after 9:00 am yesterday morning. It is said that he inquired about the 24 members of the Central Committee elected by the Fourth National Congress of Guangzhou and the 10 members of the Central Committee elected by the Guangdong delegates in Shanghai. What conflicts and remedies did Wang give a detailed answer to these two points. It was not until 10:30 am that Mr. Chen resigned and left.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Shao and He visited Wang. Shao Lizi and He Yingqin borrowed the same visit to Wang around 3:00 pm. They reported the details of the recent diplomatic negotiations in Nanjing and emphatically denied the setting up of neutral zones and the joint management of Tianjin. They also stated that China still insisted on the principle of demanding the withdrawal of Japanese troops. At 4:00 pm, Wang had to go to Guandulu to meet the petition representatives of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of large, medium and small schools in the capital. Shao and He resigned.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Aid-to-Ma Group Blocked <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the whole country to aid Ma to the death</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau was ordered to dissuade them from going north</p>
<p>The youth's automatic aid-to-Ma anti-Japanese group to the Northeast gathered more than 280 people last night and planned to take the overnight express train to Beijing to go north. The Railway Bureau received a telegram from the Central Government and dissuaded the group from going north. Although the youth of the group were enthusiastic and commendable, they had not received military training in the past. They had no reserves of funds, clothing, grain, and food. Even if they went through hardships, they could not provide any assistance to General Ma Zhanshan when they reached their destination. Therefore, they decided to dissuade them from traveling slowly. At least, they must first telegraph General Ma to report everything and get a reply before they can allow them to proceed. In the future, if there are similar organizations, they will also be strictly dissuaded. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Farewell Photo at the North Station (taken by this museum) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Meeting in the morning: At 9:00 am, the members of the group living in the South City gathered at the Public Gymnasium on Daji Road in the South City. The head of the group, Zhang Shaojie, gave a speech, saying that he hoped that the members of the group would unite and fight against the violent Japan in order to achieve the true goal of resisting Japan and saving the country. The meeting ended at 10:30 am. At that time, the gathering was discussed.</p>
<p>North Station method: Because it must pass through the concession, it is very inconvenient to walk in teams. Therefore, members of the group were ordered to go to the North Station to gather on their own. The group also prepared twelve tables of meals at the meeting so that members of the group without families could eat in the group. After the meal, they set off to the North Station.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Speech by women representatives from Beiping (Wang Kai Photography) <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Farewell at the North Station: At 1:00 pm, the members of the group gathered at the North Station. There were more than 100 members of the group. Those who came to the farewell included the China National Road Association, the Beiping Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Group, Zhiyi Primary School, the National Lawyers Association, the China Sports School, the Huisheng Midwifery School Rescue Team, the Fazei and United States Schools, the Liangjiang Schools, the Business Press Volunteer Army, the Postal Union Volunteer Army, the Citizens Union Volunteer Army, the South City Volunteer Army, and the North City Volunteer Army. The total number of people farewelling the people was more than 10,000, and the number of volunteers was more than 2,000. A farewell meeting was held. Representatives of the group and various farewell organizations gave speeches that were very sad and solemn, generally saying that they hoped that the aid-to-Ma group would fight against the Japanese pirates and destroy this dynasty. Even if they died on the battlefield in the future, it would be enough to promote the national spirit of our great Republic of China.</p>
<p>Number of departures: There were originally 454 members of the group a few days ago. Because they were going to the Northeast to carry out war, the members of the group were screened. As a result, more than 100 people were weak and could not go to the front line. Therefore, there were more than 320 people. However, only 179 people went to the North Railway Station yesterday, and more than 100 people joined the station temporarily, so there were about 300 people in total. There were two women among them.</p>
<p>Donation of fares: Before the departure, the group contacted the Railway Bureau to take a free ride to no avail. Yesterday, after 1:00 pm, they went to the North Station again because the members of the group were very poor and could not afford to buy it. The people farewelling the group raised a large sum of money to pay for the fares. They donated about 500 yuan. There were those who pledged their clothes on the spot. Chen Weixin, the representative of the Road Association (former mayor of Kaifeng), donated all of his coat and cap and the ten yuan in his pocket. Those who saw it sighed endlessly. The group was able to buy tickets and board the train as usual.</p>
<p>Family farewell: From 1:00 pm to 11:00 pm, when the members of the group gathered at the station, there were wives and young children of the members of the group, or gray-haired old men, who were crying and pulling their clothes, but most of the members of the group refused to cut off their sleeves, and there were also those who were forced by the feelings of their children and temporarily withdrew with tears. Only a very small number said,</p>
<p>Parting words: Huang Jingwan, the director of the association, said to his comrades that the patriotic people from all walks of life thought that the Ma army was isolated, fighting hard and exhausted, and sacrificed everything to resist the violent Japan. Those cowardly troops, hearing of it, could not die in shame. Now I wish the aid-to-Ma group to go and must recover the lost land and save the people of the Northeast from the depths of the water. I hope that the soldiers will return triumphantly and meet each other as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Departure situation: After the group solved the problem of taking the train, it was already 6:00 pm. The head of the group ordered all the members to go to the platform. At that time, more than 10,000 people farewelling the station sent them off with tears. After 7:00 pm, the members of the group boarded the train one after another. At 8:00 pm, they finished boarding the train.</p>
<p>Situation of being blocked: After the aid-to-Ma group boarded the train, they expected to start the train at 12:00 pm last night. The Railway Bureau was ordered to stop the train and notified the group that the overnight express train must be opened first, and then the group's train would be opened later. The members of the group and the volunteers who came to see them off did not believe it and said that the group's train must be opened first before the overnight express train could be opened. The volunteers also sat on the track to prevent being deceived. As of the time this newspaper went to press, there was no news of the train being opened.</p>
<p>Joining from various places: The reporter of Xin Sheng She learned from the group that the people in Zhenxi, Jinghan, and other places had sent letters one after another expressing their willingness to join the departure to the Northeast. The group replied by letter, saying that when the time came, they would wait at the local stations for the group to pass by and join them to go to the Northeast. Therefore, although only 300 people departed in Shanghai this time, there may be thousands of people going to Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>Rear advisory group: Huang Jingwan, Zhao Yaoquan, Tan Bozhao, and other three directors of the group have organized a rear advisory group to take charge of the rear affairs of the group. Because the group is going to the Northeast, the rear work is also very important.</p>
<p>Telegram to the whole country (excerpted above): After thinking repeatedly, we believe that if we sit idly by, we will regret it. We automatically gather patriotic comrades from all walks of life in the country, including farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and are determined to sacrifice everything and go to the Northeast to take our blood to aid General Ma and fight against Japan, to win glory for the Chinese nation, and not to be a tool for any faction or any private person, to oppose civil war and the struggle for power and profit among various factions. After joining the group, we must swear with blood. There are already more than 500 participants. It is scheduled to depart from the North Station in Shanghai on December 6. When passing through Beijing, we will hold a parade and demonstration and will not petition the government. We are determined to shed blood outside the Great Wall and expose our bones on the battlefield. Only because the journey is long, the weather is extremely cold, and the number of people is large, our economy is limited. I am afraid that we will become hungry and cold ghosts in the middle of the journey before we reach the battlefield. We have no choice but to ask the patriotic compatriots from all walks of life to donate generously. For the sake of personal integrity, we have specially entrusted the rear advisory group to formulate appropriate measures. All donations should be handed over to the Shanghai Bank and the Hefeng Bank for safekeeping, and then entrusted to the advisory group for donation. We will never spend a penny and live up to the good intentions (excerpted below).</p>
<h3 id="e108">Martial Law in Zhabei Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>From 6:00 am to 12:00 pm yesterday, the Fourth and Fifth District Security Bureaus of Zhabei were ordered to enforce special martial law. The police and constables were not allowed to take off their uniforms and were not allowed to go out. Double sentries were added to the important passes, and patrol teams and plainclothes detectives were all deployed. The search of pedestrians with suspicious behavior on the road was very strict. The garrison's patrol was also very serious, with more than ten people in each team, all led by officers.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Telegram for Investigation of Gu Weijun <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Supervisory Committee wired the Central Supervisory Committee, stating: "We submit that Foreign Minister Gu Weijun is betraying the country's interests and violating his oath of office. We respectfully request your review and transfer to the government for immediate dismissal to protect national sovereignty. Our party upholds the late Premier's legacy, advocates for national revolution, and takes down imperialism and abolishes unequal treaties as our sole political program to achieve national freedom, equality, independence, and liberation. Foreign Minister Gu Weijun took office a few days ago, and we firmly believed that he would faithfully abide by our party's political program and engage in revolutionary diplomacy. However, in the recent negotiations with Japan, not only has he failed to advocate for troop withdrawal to protect national sovereignty, but news has also spread that he has voluntarily requested a neutral buffer zone in Jinzhou. He would even be willing to withdraw troops within the Great Wall. Judging from Gu's remarks at the reception for journalists, even with his utmost efforts to gloss over the situation, he could not justify his actions. Troop withdrawal is a prerequisite for all negotiations. The envoy has twice strongly advocated for this in the League of Nations, and the League of Nations has also twice resolved to set a deadline for troop withdrawal. As the League of Nations is meeting again, it should focus on the execution of the previous two resolutions as its sole responsibility. However, it has ignored the troop withdrawal issue and created unnecessary complications, wasting many days to discuss this unnecessary neutral buffer zone issue. If the League of Nations takes this superficial approach, it will automatically indicate its inability to uphold its covenant to restrain the violence to maintain world peace. With no hope for the League of Nations, your country can only seek other avenues or autonomously recover lost territories. There is no need to continue to engage in superficial diplomacy. If the proposal for a neutral buffer zone comes from our envoy, it means that not only has the lost territory in the East not been recovered, but also territory that has not yet been lost is being handed over to international joint management. This is like inviting wolves into the house and opening the door to thieves, surpassing the treachery of Wu Sangui and Shi Jingtang. Furthermore, this resolution allows the Japanese to suppress bandits freely, negating the necessity of the so-called neutral buffer zone, akin to weaving a cocoon to trap oneself, which is alarming. This is one aspect. Recently, the Japanese, insatiable, have been disrupting Tianjin. Our country has used military force to protect our territory and imposed sanctions. If the Japanese attempt to return and cause a war, the responsibility will be theirs, and the blame will fall on them. We have no reason to retreat and concede because we fear their attacks. However, our envoy in the League of Nations proposed to establish an international committee to jointly manage Tianjin. Gu himself did not entirely deny this, but the proposal was rejected by the President of the League of Nations as it fell outside the scope of the topic. This obsequiousness is despicable. Who is responsible for this? All these are the results of the Foreign Minister's dereliction of duty and subservience to foreign powers since taking office. A nation has its supreme sovereignty to protect its territorial integrity. No weak nation should request international joint management of its own territory to undermine its sovereignty. If we request joint management because the Japanese are attacking Tianjin, will we do the same if the Japanese attack Jiangsu and Shanghai? The late Premier stated, 'China's position is second only to that of a colony, where each colony is only ruled by one country, while China is ruled by all countries.' Considering the recent actions of neutrality and joint management, we are further convinced that Gu's betrayal and loss of national sovereignty are heinous crimes. Now, the entire nation is filled with righteous indignation and desires to take desperate measures to avert this crisis. Our National Government still wants to rely on the League of Nations and has not yet taken decisive action. Its prudence and caution are understandable. However, the League of Nations has already declared bankruptcy, and the future of diplomacy is failing.</p>
<p>Even small European and American countries believe that this should not be taken as an example and must be excluded. Yet, Gu Weijun alone believes that the draft resolution of the League of Nations, "although not satisfactory, reduces disappointment." If he has no ulterior motives, he should not be so out of line. His incompetence and shamelessness are obvious. Gu Weijun was previously despised by the people for clinging to warlords and betraying the country. Now, the National Government disregarded his past misdeeds and promoted him in an exceptional manner. He should have strictly adhered to our party's political program and strived to redeem himself. However, he has not done so, but continues his old ways, committing acts of betraying national sovereignty and abandoning our party's political program, which is unforgivable. We request that your committee promptly investigate the Foreign Minister's performance since taking office and forward it to the National Government for immediate dismissal to appease the people and protect national sovereignty. This is in the best interest of the party. Respectfully submitted to the Central Supervisory Committee, Shanghai Special Municipal Supervisory Committee."</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association of University Students. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of University Students in this city issued a telegram yesterday calling for the dismissal of Gu Weijun, etc. The telegram is recorded as follows: (1) Telegram to the National Government in Nanjing for the Dismissal of Gu Weijun: Foreign Minister Gu Weijun immediately engaged in direct negotiations with Japan, designated Jinzhou as a neutral zone, and suggested that Tianjin be a jointly managed city. This not only violates the government's position of no troop withdrawal and no negotiations, but also places the country in a desperate situation. If such a person who sells the country for personal gain is not promptly dismissed and severely punished, how can public anger be appeased? We dare to wire you, respectfully requesting your review, with the utmost urgency. (2) Telegram to the National Government in Nanjing requesting the government to withdraw from the League of Nations: The Northeast has been lost for two months. The news has become increasingly dire. The League of Nations fears the violent Japanese and cannot render a just judgment or fair mediation. Our government should immediately declare its withdrawal, recall its representatives, unite the entire nation, and prepare for self-rescue. This is the most crucial plan. We hope you will not hesitate, take decisive action, and make a final decision on survival or destruction. We dare to wire you, respectfully requesting your review.</p>
<p>More Than Thirty Trade Associations. More than thirty trade associations, including the local goods industry, specially wired Foreign Minister Gu Weijun yesterday, stating: To Minister Gu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing: Since you took office as Foreign Minister, the talk of direct negotiations between China and Japan has been rampant, and the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Jinzhou has spread everywhere. The entire nation is shocked and cannot rest easy. We ask that you clearly announce the recent diplomatic policy to dispel public doubts. Considering the current state of public sentiment compared to the May Fourth era, the lessons of Cao, Zhang, and Lu are not far off. We hope you will carefully consider this. We are anxious and cannot express everything in a telegram.</p>

<p>Elected committee members in Shanghai will not cause disputes.</p>
<p>After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress concluded the day before yesterday, Wu Chaoshu, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, and other representatives were sent to Shanghai in advance. According to news received yesterday by the Shanghai-based personnel of the Guangdong Military Affairs Committee, Sun Wu and others have decided to leave Hong Kong for Shanghai today and are expected to arrive here in about ninety days. Hu has not yet decided on the date of his arrival in Shanghai. It is expected that after Sun Wu and others arrive in Shanghai, they will meet with Wang, Zou, and others from Nanjing to discuss the convening of the first meeting of the Fourth Central Committee, and then invite the Guangdong committee members to Shanghai. As for the ten central committee members elected in Shanghai by the representatives who withdrew from the Guangdong side, all except Zhang Fakui failed to be elected in Guangdong. Although it is said that Mr. Wang's speech to the representatives the day before yesterday showed a strong intention to fight for it, according to the opinions of the unsuccessful committee members, this matter can be easily negotiated and will not cause any disputes.</p>

<p>Resolved on five absurd measures. The concession authorities took strict precautions.</p>
<p>Japanese residents in various parts of China held a general meeting of Japanese residents throughout China at 1 p.m. yesterday to deal with our country's anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Japanese shops in the Hongkou district closed down uniformly in the afternoon to participate. Five measures were resolved. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Martial Law. The Japanese General Meeting was held at 1 p.m. yesterday in the empty field of the Japanese Central Elementary School at No. 6 Fielun Road. At the entrance of the meeting place, a cloth banner with the words "Japanese Resident General Meeting Throughout China" was written. In front of the meeting place, Japanese urchins distributed national flags to the representatives. The Public Concession Bureau's Political Department was deeply concerned that Japanese rogues would mix in, so it sent a large number of senior Western personnel, together with Chinese and Western armed detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, to impose temporary martial law near Shenjiawan until after the meeting adjourned at 4:20 p.m., and then dispersed.</p>

At the same time, the general meeting's statement and resolution were telegraphed to Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army and Commander Tsude of the Tianjin Fleet.</p>
<p>Absurd Declaration. The reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned many one-sided reasons for its declaration when it adjourned, and the key points are translated as follows: (1) The current conflict between Japan and China is due to the so-called revolutionary diplomatic means of the National Government, which triggered a nationwide anti-Japanese wave. Its internal shortcomings caused the Manchurian Incident and intensified its economic severance with Japan. (2) The revolutionary diplomacy touted by the National Government is to overthrow imperialism, abolish unequal treaties, and constantly implement nationalist xenophobic ideas. Therefore, the Chinese people's feelings towards foreigners are getting worse, or anti-British, or anti-Japanese, and disputes with foreign countries have repeatedly arisen. Coupled with internal strife and chaos, it has reached its extreme. The country has been unable to unify for a long time, warlords have divided the country, and bandits and communists are rampant everywhere. The 400 million people are suffering greatly. The situation in each treaty port is very critical, and China has consistently disregarded international integrity, which can be said to have lost the qualifications of a modern country. (3) Therefore, in order to uphold our Imperial treaty rights, ensure the peace and order of Manchuria, and maintain commercial rights, thorough self-defense measures must be taken. The National Government must have two requirements: (1) Liberate the illegal organizations of the anti-Japanese associations; (2) Eliminate economic severance equal to acts of war and correct its external attitude. (4) In view of the seriousness of the situation in our country, the whole country must be united to deal with the national crisis. Internally, the government authorities must be encouraged, and externally, the truth of the matter must be explained to all countries, thereby achieving a fundamental solution between Japan and China. This is to ensure peace in East Asia.</p>

<p>Declaration of the General Meeting. The Citizens' Federation issued a declaration yesterday, stating that before the completion of local autonomy in Shanghai, the Citizens' Federation will be its vanguard. Before the enactment of the municipal system in the concessions in accordance with the Municipal Organization Law of the Republic of China, the Citizens' Federation of the Special Zone must be its vanguard. Although the emergence of the Citizens' Federation is new, its cultivation is the federation of all walks of life in the business community, so its spirit, its purpose, and its frankness will continue the federation of the business community without any change. The deepening of the Three Principles of the People has long been engraved in the heart and soul. My colleagues in the Citizens' Federation deeply understand that the country is established by the people, and the government is made by the people. If the elements of the people are sound and the words and deeds of the people are sound, the country will not be strong and the government will not be powerful. Therefore, my colleagues' consistent proposition is to start from themselves and implement the late premier's legacy of "peaceful struggle to save China." Extend this to the members of this federation, as is the case, and extend it to all citizens of the special zone, so that the bad habits of "shirking responsibility from each other" and "complaining against each other" can be swept away, and the inferiority of our country's people relying on others can be swept away. In the end, all citizens, in addition to fulfilling their national duties, should hold on to the current malpractice of "those in office must not seek their own government" and "those not in office must seek their own government" and eradicate it completely. If everyone can promote it and broaden it, then the army protecting the border will never retreat, and the country's land will be offered to Japan. In addition, the abolition of unequal treaties, the prevention of foreign economic invasion, the promotion and improvement of national livelihood, etc., will be as easy as turning the hand over. At the beginning of the establishment, I would like to make this declaration to make up for the bad news.</p>

<p>The People's Diplomacy Support Association held its first standing committee meeting at 10 a.m. on the 5th of this month. Committee members Chen Qixiang, Yu Shousong, Liu Xiuru, Wang Jianmin, Ji Shiyuan, Sun Zhuozhai, and Liu Chuanzhong attended. Wang Jianmin chaired the meeting, and Liu Chuanzhong recorded the minutes.

<h3 id="e117">Declaration of the Shanghai Citizens' National Salvation Association <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xuanren, Peng Xuewen, Qian Zanting, Tang Huaxuan, Xu Mojun, Cheng Zhiliang, Ye Qiming, Zhang Guojun, Zhang Juansheng, Gu Ruofeng, Wu Shengqing, Pan Yaoting, Shen Xianzhi, Shan Chunqiao, Liu Zhenqiu, Liu Liang, Jiang Chun, Zhao Zhishan, and others issued a declaration yesterday, saying that since the violent Japanese invaded and occupied our three provinces and disturbed our Tianjin, the officials defending the territory have led the way in retreating with a policy of non-resistance. In less than three months, they lost tens of thousands of miles of territory. The government authorities did not attempt to save themselves, but relied solely on the League of Nations. Is this what is meant by a revolutionary government and revolutionary diplomacy? Recently, the designation of Jinzhou as a neutral zone and the request for the great powers to jointly manage Tianjin and direct negotiations with Japan will become a reality from the rumors. Then, what the Manchu Qing government and the warlord government dared not do and could not bear to do is being done by the revolutionary government one by one. We do not know how the officials of the government who claim to be revolutionaries will explain themselves, and our 400 million descendants of Yan and Huang will become the sequel to Vietnam and India. My colleagues have witnessed the strange disaster of national extinction and species extinction that is imminent. If we do not act quickly to save ourselves, how will we survive in the world? Based on the sense of responsibility of everyone, we have gathered my comrades to organize the Shanghai Citizens' National Salvation Association to fight together. Regarding the diplomatic, military, political, financial, and economic aspects, we believe that the current important plan for saving the country, and we deeply hope that patriots from all walks of life will rise up together to plan it. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Deadline for Official Shatian Property to Increase Grain Tax <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>State the reason by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Zhu Yan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, issued a proclamation yesterday, stating that in the matter of the official Shatain property households' licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance that have not yet been increased in grain tax and entered into the register, they should request the Bureau to pay the fees for increasing the grain tax and exchange them for land business licenses. The deadline has been stipulated and announced several times, and all have been followed. However, after the deadline, there are still many who submitted the reason for being overdue and requested to handle it with flexibility. It has been verified that the reasons stated are all sincere and can be considered. If we reject them directly, it would not be irrelevant to the original intention of safeguarding people's property, and if we still accept it, how can we treat the households who know that they are overdue and dare not request it? Now, in order to give some flexibility and show great fairness, it is planned that each household that is overdue should submit the reasons for requesting an increase in the overdue grain tax before December 30 of this year, so that the Bureau can review and handle them separately. From January 1, 1921, all overdue documents, no matter what the reasons are stated, will be handled in accordance with the repeated announcements, and no more flexibility will be given in order to emphasize the laws and orders. As for the newly received documents, they should still request an increase in grain tax in accordance with the regulations within six months from the date of receiving the documents. It is urgently announced that all households should abide by it. This proclamation is specially issued.</p>

<p>According to reports from various Customs Commissioners, the quantities of prohibited items such as opium and morphine seized during the months of July, August, and September of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) are as follows:</p>
<p>A total of 251,717 taels and 5 fen of foreign and domestic opium, 5 taels and 5 qian of opium residue, 1,197 taels and 1 qian of morphine, 182 taels and 8 qian of cocaine, heroin, etc., 9 dan and 57 jin of poppy seeds and poppy pods, etc., and various drugs containing toxic substances, estimated to be worth 3,349 taels, 8 qian, 2 fen and 5 li in Customs silver.</p>

<p>China Merchants New Steamers Commence Service: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently purchased two sea-going steamers from Norway, named "Hai Rui" and "Hai Xiang," each with a load capacity of over 2,700 tons. "Hai Rui" arrived in Shanghai last week, and after completion of repairs, undertook its maiden voyage to Dalian yesterday afternoon. The shipping company's head office has not yet appointed a business director; instead, the position will be filled by the second buyer. It is reported that the "Hai Xiang" also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is undergoing minor repairs while customs procedures are being completed. It is expected to join the Northern Seas route as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Japanese Steamships: Most Japanese steamship companies have voluntarily suspended operations. Although Nippon Yusen, Nisshin Kisen, Osaka Shosen, and Dalian Kisen are still operating as usual, passenger and cargo volumes are greatly reduced. Ships on the Yangtze River route are returning empty, and on the overseas routes, imports into China are nonexistent, and exports are only about one-tenth of their former volume. However, last week, about 20,000 packages of bran and eggs were exported. Among the Chinese traveling to Japan, most are students. The number of Japanese returning to their home country has gradually decreased recently, but groups of three to five people are returning in the name of resident community members on each ship. It is rumored that these Japanese are being sent back by the Japanese consulate and are probably joining the military.</p>
<h3 id="e121">County Government Orders Completion of County Organization <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued an order to the heads of each district yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of urging completion, we have received order No. 6268 from the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, which states: 'The matter of completing county organization has been repeatedly urged by telegram and personnel have been dispatched to supervise. The final deadline is now just over a month away, yet the county has not yet reported completion. Such negligence of official orders is extremely regrettable. In addition to separate instructions, this order is issued to urge the county magistrate to strictly instruct his subordinates to earnestly and legally complete the necessary matters before the end of the year, fill out the forms, and report on the basic work of local autonomy. If there is further delay or negligence, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. This is an urgent order,' etc. In light of this, this case concerns the selection of neighborhood leaders, and we have previously ordered the district heads to supervise the township heads to expedite legal proceedings. However, to date, only the Fifth District has reported completion, and the remaining districts have delayed compliance, which is a serious mistake.

<p>Petition to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Request for Negotiations by the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Friendship Association of the French Municipal Council, regarding the dismissal of twenty-five workers due to the closure of the customs during the autumn horse racing season, has been negotiating without any result of reinstatement so far. Therefore, at 2 PM yesterday, a joint meeting of the heads of each branch, the leaders of each group, the foremen, the important officials, and the representatives was convened at the association's office in Xiaoximen to discuss all pending matters. Qiu Gaogang presided over the meeting, and Zheng Fengchu recorded the minutes. After the chairman reported on the progress of the negotiations, discussions began, and it was unanimously decided to send six representatives, including Shen Cai geng, Ding Youzhi, Yang Wut, Peng Quanfu, Qiu Gaogang, and Xu Qiutang, along with all the dismissed members (over two hundred people), to petition the Municipal Government and request assistance from higher-level organizations. At the same time, they requested the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to negotiate with the French Municipal Council authorities to allow all the dismissed workers to be reinstated immediately and set a deadline of 9 AM this morning for the dismissed workers to gather at the association and depart for the Municipal Government and various agencies to petition.</p>

<p>Organize the Xiaoshun River Dredging Work Relief Committee</p>
<p>Although the floods in the areas near the Cao'e River in Zhejiang Province this year are not as severe as those in Hankou and Gaoyou, the upstream reaches of the river are silted up with mud and sand, making the defenses weak and the danger extreme. If preventive measures are not taken, the consequences will be unimaginable. Shanghai-based Zhejiang Shaoxing gentry have long desired to undertake dredging, but have been unable to do so due to limited funds. Now, with the assistance of the Shaoxing Fellow-Villagers Association, funding has been secured. Therefore, the organizers, including Wang Xiaolai, Song Hanzhang, Feng Zhongqing, Xie Taofu, Yu Futian, Lu Zhimiao, Yan Chengde, Weng Yunhe, Tao Zizhang, Wu Dongsheng, Zhang Jinghan, Gu Zuoxi, and Gong Shaogeng, thirteen people in total, gathered at the meeting room of the Central Trust Company the night before last to discuss how to proceed. On the spot, Wang Xiao was publicly elected as the chairman, and it was decided to name the committee the Xiaoshun River Dredging Work Relief Committee (Cao'e River is also known as Xiaoshun River) to actively carry out the dredging of river sand. However, this work relief effort requires a vast amount of funds, which cannot be accomplished with the few thousand dollars allocated by the Shaoxing Fellow-Villagers Association. It is now planned to organize a fundraising committee to solicit donations widely, so that a little bit can be collected to achieve complete success and make it a permanent solution. It is said that the donation collection point is at the Central Trust Company on Beijing Road, and the association's office is temporarily located at the Shaoxing Fellow-Villagers Association at 26 Avenue Edouard VII.</p>

<p>At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday on Route Paul Beau in Western Shanghai, as factories were letting out, Japanese Marine Corps patrol soldiers conducted an armed demonstration. Lu Jinbiao, a small vendor, was walking along the road when the Japanese patrol soldiers intentionally provoked him and beat him with sticks, causing minor injuries. Workers who were watching were displeased and argued with them, and they were also beaten. Fortunately, Ren Luping, the district chief of the Sixth District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, heard about the incident and immediately dispatched a senior police officer to mediate, and the Japanese soldiers returned to their unit.</p>

Please quickly convey to all printing and book industries in your association that next year's calendars must print anti-Japanese patriotic slogans to arouse the people's spirit to save the country and kill the enemy.

<h3 id="e130">The Public Works Department Again Discusses Limiting Stalls at Next Year's Jing'an Temple Temple Fair <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Stallholders Jointly Petition</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple is a scenic spot in Western Shanghai. Every year on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, which is the celebration of Buddha's birthday, crowds of tourists flock to the area, and thousands of vendors gather to set up stalls, specializing in selling domestically produced goods, creating a grand scene for a time. This year, the Public Works Department proposed limiting the stalls, but after efforts to lobby by Abbot Zhifa of Jing'an Temple, petitions from all stallholders, and assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Association, and other organizations, as well as local gentry, the Public Works Department finally withdrew the order to limit stalls and continued to operate according to the old rules. Now, it is heard that the Public Works Department is again discussing limiting the stalls at next year's Jing'an Temple Buddha's birthday celebration. Abbot Zhifa of Jing'an Temple is still firmly lobbying. Upon hearing the news, the stallholders jointly petitioned the Public Works Department. The text of their petition is as follows: "Regarding the petition to withdraw the order to limit the stalls at the Jing'an Temple Buddha's birthday celebration in order to maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people: We, the stallholders, are deeply shocked to hear that your department intends to limit the stalls at the Jing'an Temple Buddha's birthday fair starting next year. This temple fair has been passed down from ancient times and has a history of over a thousand years. Moreover, the former abbot of Jing'an Temple, the late Venerable Zheng Sheng, stipulated in the land lease contract with your department that there would be a Buddha's birthday temple fair where stalls could be set up at will. We, the stallholders, also regard it as a local custom. Every year during the Buddha's birthday, the local villagers gather and sell the local products and tools they have made throughout the year, taking advantage of this opportunity to maintain their livelihood for the year. This is both lawful and beautiful, and it is also in line with the periodic market system of European and American villages. Last year, your department proposed limiting the stalls, but after the Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Citizens' Association, and other legal groups represented the stallholders to petition, and with the petition from the abbot of Jing'an Temple and all the stallholders, the order was finally withdrawn, and the operation continued according to the old rules, for which we were deeply grateful. Now, your department suddenly proposes to implement the restrictions next year, prohibiting many areas that could be used for setting up stalls, which will prevent half of the stallholders from setting up stalls, destroying good customs, and harming the livelihood of ordinary people, which is truly regrettable. Moreover, in the past, many stallholders set up in the middle of the road, but now they have all moved to the cement steps on both sides. In recent years, the roads have been widened, so there is absolutely no obstacle to traffic. This temple fair is also beneficial to society and the local area, and it is best for preserving ancient sites, promoting industry, and customs. We have always admired your department's respect for local relics and its concern for the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, we specifically jointly request that you withdraw the order to limit the stalls in order to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in Western Shanghai. We would be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to Mr. Mackie, Director-General, and Mr. Ho, Commissioner, of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Number of Inmates at the Caohijing Prison Increases to Over Two Thousand <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Lighter Criminals Temporarily Suspended from Imprisonment</p>
<p>To Be Executed in the Detention Center</p>
<p>In recent years, the population of this city has increased sharply, and the quality of people has become uneven. Therefore, the number of criminals has also increased sharply. When the Second Jiangsu Prison in Caohijing was built, the original quota was for accommodating 800 prisoners. Although the original quota was sometimes exceeded due to the rotation of prisoners in and out, there was no concern about overcrowding. The original quota for the detention center of the local court was only 300 people, and the prisoners were also more comfortable. However, since last year to this year, in one corner of the Chinese area, the Public Security Bureau has been sending criminals to the court every day, always exceeding a hundred people. At the same time, there are also direct accusations to the court, and those who are released after paying fines are still not a few. Therefore, there are often six to seven hundred people in the detention center. Fortunately, the detention center built a new cell block in the fifteenth year, so there is no panic about not being able to accommodate everyone. However, it is already feeling very crowded. However, once a criminal conviction is finalized, they are sent to prison. Therefore, the court must send twenty to thirty prisoners to the Second Prison for execution every morning, which has led to a sharp increase in the number of inmates in the prison to over two thousand, which is three times the original quota, causing a panic about overcrowding. Currently, Warden Dong Changmin has considered building additional cells on the remaining land, but construction cannot begin due to lack of funds. However, the later prisoners really cannot be accommodated anymore. Therefore, he submitted a request to the High Court to ask for a relief method. On the one hand, he consulted with President Shen and Chief Prosecutor Liu of the Local Court to temporarily suspend sending prisoners for execution to the prison in order to alleviate the situation. It is now heard that the High Court has ordered that criminal prisoners sentenced to more than three months of imprisonment should still be sent to prison for execution, while those sentenced to less than three months can be executed in the detention center, because those with short sentences are easier to be released.</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Rascal Sells His Wife into Prostitution <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>A Deposit of Four Hundred Yuan Has Been Paid Wife Discovers Plot and Writes to Her Brother for Rescue</p>
<p>All Parties Involved Are Detained Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Hua Sun, a woman from Changzhou residing at No. 135 Weituoma Road, is 29 years old and has some beauty. Her husband, Hua Fusheng, from Wuxi, does not engage in proper work and spends his time with dissolute people, leading to an empty wallet. On the 23rd of last month, on the pretext of taking his wife to the Great World to play, he colluded with He A Si and Gao A Gen from Suzhou to sell Ms. Hua to Wu, a woman from Guangxi Road, Fuzhi Lane, No. 11, for 400 yuan. 14 yuan was paid as a deposit, and the rest would be paid after the boat to Shantou arrived and Ms. Sun was taken there to work as a prostitute. After the voyage, the money would be cleared. After Ms. Sun temporarily resided at Wu's place, she heard that she was going to Shantou to work as a prostitute. Because the journey was long and there would be no day to return home, she took the opportunity to write to her brother, Sun Zhiqing. After receiving the letter, Sun was extremely shocked and reported the matter to the Yangshupu Police Station the day before yesterday. Detective Ma Zonglai went to arrest Hua, He, and Gao and went to No. 11 Fuzhi Lane on Guangxi Road to rescue Ms. Hua Sun, while Wu had already escaped upon hearing the news. Hua Fusheng and the others were taken to the police station and detained. Hua Sun was taken back by her brother. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special Court, High Division 1. According to the police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, the statement of the case was presented, and it was requested that the case be investigated. According to Hua Sun's statement, she married the defendant Hua Fusheng as his wife in August of last year. At that time, he tricked her into going to the Great World and Tianyunlou to play. They went to a certain inn to stay overnight. The next day, they wrote a paper in the room of the New Hotel on Jiujiang Road. At that time, He A Si and Gao A Gen were also present and sent to Ms. Wu's place. Hua Fusheng (her husband) said he was going to Shantou to look for business. Later, she learned that she was going to be a prostitute, so she wrote a letter to inform her brother. The police detective came and rescued her, etc. According to the testimony of her brother, Sun Zhicheng, Hua Fusheng confessed that the matter was his wife's voluntary choice to go to a foreign port to be a prostitute, but the rest of his testimony was ambiguous. He A Si confessed that Ms. Hua's sale into prostitution was arranged by Hua Fusheng and Gao A Si in advance and that he was not the mastermind. Gao A Si confessed that Hua Fusheng discussed with him that he wanted to buy his wife as a prostitute, and he said it was not possible and that he needed to find a job for a female worker who could also earn money. Lawyer Fan Gang was also hired for defense. Judge Xiao Xie fen ordered the three defendants to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Woman Accuses Man of Abandonment after Seduction <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Requests Alimony of Over 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Shi Jupao, a woman from Changshu, is now 20 years old. She has recently hired a lawyer to sue Shao Demao (aka De Mao), who resides at 366 Taian Lane, North Shaanxi Road, in the First Special District Court, for abandonment after seduction, requesting a judgment ordering the payment of alimony, etc. Her petition states that in February of this year, through the introduction of Xu Wu bao, she married the defendant as a concubine and lived together at 62.5 Jing'an Lane on Longmen Road. The defendant paid expenses of about 200 yuan per month. This lasted for five months. The plaintiff suddenly fell ill and was bedridden. The defendant initially showed signs of disgust in his words, and then disappeared completely. The love of the past was all in vain. The plaintiff was so irritated that the illness worsened. Fortunately, her elderly mother was by her side to take care of her and provide treatment. After several months, she finally recovered, but she had mortgaged almost everything and had no way to borrow money. Therefore, she entrusted lawyer Jiang to send a letter to inquire, but the defendant ignored it. Having no choice, she filed a criminal lawsuit, which was not accepted. The plaintiff is a weak woman with heavy responsibilities to support her elders and raise her younger siblings. Now that she has been lured away and then abandoned, if the court does not order the defendant to pay alimony, how will she maintain her livelihood? Therefore, she requests that the court order the defendant to pay 20,000 yuan in alimony, 2,000 yuan in tea money, and about 3,000 yuan for living and medical expenses. The case was heard the day before yesterday by Judge Guo Shouyi in Civil Court 7. The defendant, Shao Demao, hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Wang Fushang to defend him, saying that the plaintiff was a prostitute named Hui Xia Lao Ba, then changed her name to Yang Yuanyuan Lao Ba, and now is named Lu Lan Lao Ba. The defendant met the plaintiff in the Yang Yuanyuan brothel, where the plaintiff was still an assistant (commonly known as a follower). Later, the defendant would call for Yang Yuanyuan whenever he needed to socialize in a brothel, and the plaintiff would always follow. There is a book of Yang Yuanyuan's records that can be checked. Later, the plaintiff moved to Jing'an Lane. The defendant was completely unaware at first. Later, the plaintiff entrusted Ni Tianbiao to copy down the address and come forward, claiming that the plaintiff's business was sparse and begging the defendant to help invite guests. The defendant refused politely. On the tenth day of the fifth lunar month, he met the plaintiff on the road, who said that she had only earned over 40 yuan in Yang Yuanyuan's place last month, which was not enough for shoes and socks. If there were no clients to help, she would have no face to return to the brothel and begged the defendant to take on the opening act. The defendant agreed casually and then suddenly received a letter from a lawyer, named Shi, whom the defendant did not know. The defendant returned the letter. The defendant's claim that he had a marital relationship with her is completely false. On November 26th, the defendant's friend, Chen Youqing, hosted a banquet at the Hongyun brothel on Shantou Road and called for Lu Lan, and the plaintiff also followed. If given some time, the defendant will be able to find considerable evidence to prevent the plaintiff from denying it, and the defendant has never lived with the plaintiff. How can she obtain the status of a concubine? Then, the unreasonableness of her demand can be seen in its entirety. He should request that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed and that the plaintiff be ordered to bear the costs of the case, etc. Judge Guo checked the arguments and announced that the debate in this case was concluded and that the sentencing was scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Shen Yingxiang of Zhihe Bank Is Sued Again <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Qu Hongsheng's 30,000 Yuan Missing</p>
<p>Accuses Shen of Breach of Trust and Damage to Savings</p>
<p>After the Zhihe Yongji Bank closed down, the deficit was quite large. Many cases in which the manager of the bank, Shen Yingxiang, was sued by various creditors in court have also occurred. Recently, Qu Hongsheng hired lawyer Ni Gang to file a complaint with the First Special District Court accusing Shen Yingxiang, the manager of Zhihe Yongji Bank, of breach of trust, etc. The petition states that the plaintiff had 30,000 taels of silver in savings in Zhihe Yongji Bank, managed by the defendant Shen Yingxiang. On August 20th of this year, the bank suddenly closed down, and Shen Yingxiang disappeared without a trace. He originally intended to sue, but he learned that Gan Jiji, a creditor of the bank, had already filed a criminal lawsuit and that the court had issued a warrant for Shen's arrest, and he had been arrested and brought to court to post bail for liquidation. Therefore, he did not proceed with the lawsuit. Now, he has learned that after the defendant was released on bail, he did not prepare to repay his debts and planned to flee again, which further shows that on the day before the defendant closed down, he colluded with his son, Shen Chengfu, to issue promissory notes and withdraw hundreds of thousands of taels in cash, intending to abscond with the money. The circumstances are very clear. The defendant, as the manager of Zhihe Bank, intended to gain illegal benefits for himself and committed an act of breach of trust in his duties, causing damage to the plaintiff's savings, which constitutes the crime of breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, he has filed a lawsuit requesting the immediate arrest of the defendant Shen Yingxiang and a legal investigation. The court approved the petition and ordered a summons. The defendant failed to appear for questioning the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's representative, lawyer Ni Gang, stated the case. The judge stated that since the defendant had not appeared, there was no way to proceed, and he ordered that the date be changed and that the defendant be summoned again for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e135">A Young Woman from a Good Family Abducted to Hankou and Forced into Prostitution <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Abductor Was a Close Friend of Her Husband</p>
<p>She Was Able to Escape After the Guards Let Down Their Guard</p>
<p>Cai Jinyun, a chauffeur from Haimen who resides at No. 7 Yudeli, Penglai Road in the Chinese Concession, married Wang Xiuzhen (19 years old this year), a woman from Suzhou, in March of last year. On April 28th of this year, she suddenly disappeared, only returning home on the 14th of last month. According to her, Yang Amao, a chauffeur from the Public Security Bureau (from Nantong), colluded with Cai Ziqing, Zhang Asan, and others to abduct her to Hankou to become a prostitute, but failed. After returning to Shanghai, she was again imprisoned in a brothel and forced into prostitution. Cai learned of the situation, and the couple jointly entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Local Court, accusing Yang and the other two, as well as Zhang Jinhu and his wife Mao Xiangchun, Zhang Xinjie, the female proprietor Sheng Asheng, and others – a total of eight people – of enticing and raping her. The day before yesterday afternoon, the court summoned both parties, and Ge Zhiqin, the presiding judge of the criminal court, opened the first criminal court to hear the case. The judge first questioned the ages, origins, and occupations of the plaintiff and defendants. Only Yang Amao and his lawyer appeared in court; the rest were absent. The judge ordered Cai Jinyun and the witness Cai Jinzhou to leave the courtroom. According to Cai Wang Xiuzhen's testimony, the defendant Yang Amao was in the same profession as her husband and a close friend, often visiting her house. On the afternoon of April 28th of this year, Yang Amao came to her house and said that her husband was at the Gonghe Inn in Tangjiawan, calling her to go there. Believing this to be true, she went with him but did not find her husband. She was then imprisoned inside. That night, she was sexually assaulted by Yang Amao and Cai Ziqing. The next morning at seven o'clock, they took her to room number four of the Pingjiang Inn on Sanma Road and imprisoned her, forbidding her to make a sound. On the 30th, they drew up a document and paid money, and Mao Xiangchun took her to Hankou to force her into prostitution. She was beaten when this failed. In May, they brought her back to Shanghai, first residing at No. 94 Huai'anli, Baker Road. In August, they moved her to Zhang Jinhu's house at No. 196 Glock Road in the French Concession, forcing her into prostitution and having people guard her. On the morning of the 14th of last month, the guards let down their guard, and she escaped to the iron gate of Fangbanqiao, where she met her husband's brother, Cai Jinzhou, who took her home. She told her husband and in-laws the whole story and filed a lawsuit, etc. The judge ordered Cai Jinyun to appear in court. According to his testimony, his wife disappeared on April 28th of this year, and he reported it to the Second Branch of the Second District Public Security Bureau. When his wife returned home, he learned that she had been abducted by Yang and the others. The witness is in the same profession and a friend of Yang. The rest of his testimony was similar to what Xiuzhen said. The witness Cai Jinzhou testified that Cai Jinyun is his cousin. At eleven o'clock in the morning on November 14th, he met his sister-in-law on Huacheng Road and took her home. He did not know the circumstances before or after. The defendant Yang Amao denied the abduction and rape, stating that he had never visited Cai Jinyun's house and that he was being framed. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the second defendant, Cai Ziqing, had been arrested by the plaintiff and detained in the Public Security Bureau in the Chinese Concession four or five days ago. He requested that he be transferred to the court for questioning. The addresses of the remaining four, seven, eight, and three defendants are correct, but they have not been served with summons. He requested that arrest warrants be issued. Both parties reside in the Chinese Concession, but because the crime occurred under the jurisdiction of this court, the lawsuit was filed here. The judge then ordered the plaintiff couple to leave and asked the witness Cai Jinzhou whether his sister-in-law and the defendant Yang Amao had any contact on weekdays. Cai replied that he lived separately and never interfered in their affairs. After his sister-in-law returned home, she told him that she had been raped by Yang. The plaintiff Cai Jinyun also stated that the second defendant Cai Ziqing was arrested by his younger brother and taken to the Second Branch of the Second District Public Security Bureau. At this point, it was already dusk, and the judge adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of December 12th, when Cai Ziqing would be brought in, and Zhang Jinhu and others would be arrested and further questioned. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Residents Must Be Careful</p>
<p>At the home of He Yaozu, located at No. 1 Jimao Alley, Qinglong Bridge in the Nanshi area, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, just as the family was preparing to have lunch, they suddenly heard a loud pounding on the door. When they asked who it was, a voice outside said they were there to visit Mr. He. As soon as they opened the door, three tall men strode in. Without asking any questions, they pulled out guns and threatened the family into silence. The He family realized they were being robbed and were terrified. One of the robbers went into the downstairs bedroom and stole gold jewelry and other items worth several hundred yuan. They then went upstairs, intending to search for more valuables. However, the robbers were afraid of taking too long and attracting attention, so they hurriedly abandoned their search, went downstairs, gathered their accomplices, and fled with the stolen goods. As they left, they fired a shot into the air as a show of force.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Compensated 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Dai Afeng, a Suzhou native who lives at 61 Mafang Alley, Longmen Road and plays the trumpet, was riding a bicycle from south to north on Avenue Lieutenant Peten in the French Concession at around 1:00 PM on the 30th of last month, crossing Avenue Edward VII when he hit Zhu Zhiquan, a Shaoxing native (52 years old, a medicinal herb merchant), causing head injuries and death. The police detained Dai and sent him to the Second Special Court for questioning. Yesterday, he was interrogated again. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the north-south lights were red at the time, and the defendant violated traffic regulations by crossing the road, resulting in the death of a person. He is now prosecuting him under Article 291 of the Criminal Law and Article 4 of the Traffic Regulations, requesting an investigation. Police officer Lu Yongtian, badge number 368, also reported the situation of the defendant's violation of traffic regulations at the time of the accident. Zhu Luo Shi, the wife of the deceased, stated that her husband was tragically killed in the accident and that she has four young and old family members who have no means of support. She requested that the defendant be ordered to compensate her for damages to maintain her livelihood. The defendant confessed that the north-south lights were red that day, and he wanted to turn east, but he was stopped by the police, causing the car to rush north and cause the accident. He stated that he has an elderly mother and is very poor, pleading for leniency. Judge Ge Zhiqin reviewed the confession, ordered the police lawyer to make arguments, and declared the trial closed. Dai Afeng was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for the crime of causing death due to negligence. The number of days of detention before the verdict was allowed to be deducted, and he was ordered to compensate Zhu Luo Shi for damages of 500 yuan.</p>

<p>Zhenxing Woolen Textile Factory, which first created the Shuanglong brand of domestic wool yarn, has been overwhelmed by purchasers from all over the country since its production. This is because of its excellent quality and low price, making it a rising force in resisting imported goods. In addition to being sold by Sincere Company, Wing On Company, the Guohuo Shopping Mall, Samsung Department Store, and major yarn stores, the factory also has distribution points at the Hangzhou Commodity Exhibition Hall and the Tianjin Guohuo Sales Office. Recently, in order to promote the popularization of wool yarn for winter service, it has also established a special sales department at Sanyou Industrial Society, which is most active in promoting domestic goods. At the same time, it is soliciting more than 10,000 pieces of novel winter supplies made using the factory's yarn and preparing to open a winter yarn handicraft competition. It will solicit the yarn handicraft achievements of various girls' schools and publicly invite handicraft experts to judge the grades and award prizes separately, in order to awaken the Chinese people's efforts to revitalize various craft industries necessary for daily use. It is heard that customers who purchase the factory's yarn will also receive prize tickets, and each ticket will be given a yarn-woven item as a gift. At this time of the winter season, it is indeed a major new contribution to yarn service. The detailed rules will be announced in various newspapers soon.</p>

<p>Li Pingzhi, a 33-year-old man from Zhenhai, has been operating the Xiecheng Foreign Goods Store at 67 Zhangchuan Alley in Nanshi, specializing in various cosmetic products. Yesterday morning at 9:05 AM, the second-floor loft of the store suddenly caught fire, and it quickly spread. The fire brigade drove to the scene and put out the fire before it spread to neighboring houses. The chief police officer of the Second Branch of the Second District was dispatched to take Li to the station. After being questioned by Chief Xu, Li stated that the second-floor loft of the store has never been inhabited, and none of the colleagues in the store are addicted to smoking. The cause of the fire is probably due to the Baohetang pharmacy next door baking medicine. Chief Xu considered Li's statement to be unfounded and immediately prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>Bai Chengde, a native of Gaoyou who currently resides at Yongxiang Building, west of the bridge next to Xuejiawan Road in Nanshi, used to farm in his hometown to support himself. This autumn, his fields were flooded, and he had no way to make a living. He came to Shanghai alone and was introduced by a fellow villager to pull a rickshaw at the home of Wang Rongqing, a native of Yancheng, at 126 Huiguan Street. Because the floods in various counties in Jiangbei were widespread, the number of people hiring rickshaws at Wang's house, both old and new, was much higher than in previous years. Although the income was limited, it was better than starving to death. Therefore, Bai Chengde came to Shanghai for several months, but the actual time he spent pulling a rickshaw was less than a month, and his life was extremely difficult. Yesterday, he repeatedly pleaded with the rickshaw owner, who gave him rickshaw license number 4317 to operate. Unexpectedly, when he arrived near Xieqiao, two men, appearing to be workers, sat down in a rickshaw that had been pre-hired, and one temporarily hired Bai's rickshaw, claiming to be foremen who wanted to find workers on Linyin Road. They chatted with Bai about his family life as they went along, behaving as if they were very close to him. Before long, they got out of the rickshaws, looking around and pretending to be looking for someone. They stopped and started several times. When they reached a certain alley on Linyin Road, they both got out of the rickshaws and told Bai to go inside and get the fare. The other rickshaw puller volunteered to watch the rickshaws, and told Bai to bring the money with him. Bai suspected something was wrong, and when he came out, both the men and the rickshaws were gone. He went into the alley to look for the passengers, but they had already escaped by another route. There are several cases of theft and fraud like this every day in the Chinese Concession. The loser has to prepare 15 or 16 yuan to redeem the original rickshaw. The rickshaw owner had repeatedly warned him about this, but Bai was tricked by the thieves. It is extremely unfortunate. He is now wandering on the streets day and night, searching for his lost rickshaw. His situation is extremely pitiful.</p>

<h3 id="e154">To All Readers Who Communicate with Letters <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Fight, defend, or make peace?</p>
<p>Your letters unanimously advocate for war, and the intensity of your excitement has reached a boiling point. At the same time, you vehemently criticize Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance and the central government's unwavering reliance on the League of Nations, which is ineffective and painless, and what you are especially worried about is the government's tendency to compromise with Japan.</p>
<p>In fact, what we advocate is not war, but defense. When the enemy attacks, we should do our best to resist and not let them cross the line. This is defense. Even if defense leads to war, it can only be called a defensive war. Zhang Xueliang's crime of non-resistance is the crime of not defending.</p>
<p>The way to establish a country is first to be able to defend. Only by being able to defend can one advance to fight or retreat to make peace. If the enemy attacks Shenyang, then defend Shenyang. If the enemy attacks Jilin, then defend Jilin. If the enemy attacks Jinzhou, then defend Jinzhou. If the enemy attacks Tianjin, then defend Tianjin. The local military authorities are responsible for defending the territory. If the enemy comes, they should naturally defend without needing to ask for instructions from senior officials or the central government. If they can do this, the enemy will have no weaknesses to exploit and will naturally be discouraged and return home. This is our only hope, and this is our only advocacy.</p>
<p>Even if a certain place is taken advantage of by the enemy, if the first line of defense cannot be held, then defend the second line of defense. If the second line of defense cannot be held, then defend the third line of defense. If you really exert all your strength and retreat only when your strength is exhausted, the enemy will definitely not dare to underestimate you, and the people will also be moved by your righteousness and be happy to provide support. Look at the results of Ma Zhanshan's hard fighting. Although Qiqihar eventually fell, Japanese newspapers wrote about it in great detail, expressing their admiration. Aid from all sides is still pouring in. The total strength of Zhang Xueliang's troops inside and outside the Guan is more than dozens of times that of the officers under Ma Zhanshan's isolated army in the Hei province. Is it really that there is no one like Ma Zhanshan? Is the ease with which the rear provides supplies not comparable to the remote corner of the Hei province? If on September 18, 19, 20, 21, etc., you held the city firmly, fought to the death, and never retreated, after a certain period of time, there would be international support. Even if Shenyang and Jilin were eventually lost due to the pressure of the enemy's troops, the Japanese would not treat us as incompetent as they do today and act recklessly. The people would treat Zhang Xueliang as they treat Ma Zhanshan, so that the reputation of China and the dignity of the nation, although defeated, would still be glorious, and it would not necessarily be a complete defeat. If we take a defensive posture and not an offensive posture, how can the Japanese side accuse us of starting a war?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the past, let's talk about the future. What we ask of the government is defense. If they attack Jinzhou, then defend Jinzhou. Why rush to agree to劃立中立區 [establish a neutral zone]? If they attack Tianjin, then defend Tianjin. Why automatically request that all countries jointly manage it? Could it be that if they attack the capital, they will also ask all countries to jointly manage the capital?</p>
<p>This request cannot be said to be forcing someone to do something difficult. The country supports an army of 2 million men, and the people bear the cost of 400 million yuan a year to support the army. If we can't even defend, how will the government face the people of the whole country?</p>
<p>If you say you can do it, then why rush to compromise? On the one hand, stand firm, on the other hand, declare that you will adopt Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to cut off commercial relations and prohibit all exchanges between people. After six months or even a year, let's see how Japan changes.</p>
<p>Readers, what we ask of the government is just one word: "defend." But what is the latest news? Have you paid attention to the following news items in yesterday's newspaper?</p>
<p>(1) Shi Zhaoji sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, explaining China's position on the withdrawal of troops to within the Great Wall and the execution of police duties in the neutral zone. The Nanjing government's position has not changed in any way, but it recognizes that the neutral zone has several indispensable formalities attached.</p>
<p>(2) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations notified all members of the information obtained from Minister Shi. This information is mostly about the negotiations between Chinese Foreign Minister Gu and other key figures in the Nanjing government regarding the status of Jinzhou.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese army's withdrawal to Shenyang is because the Chinese have taken the initiative to withdraw their troops into the Guan. Now, if we reject the establishment of a neutral zone, it is proof that China has broken its promise. If this news is true, can we still say that the government has not tended towards compromise? Please pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e157">The Voice of Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— The Impoverished Swordsman of Yun</p>
<p>In the first month of the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign, Yang Zitong, the Chinese envoy to Russia, became seriously ill in the Russian capital and eventually passed away. The Russian King and Queen sent officials to express their condolences, and their sentiments were gracious and generous. Subsequently, the "睰哇" (Transliteration: possibly "Nova") newspaper of that country obtained a telegram from Tokyo, Japan, stating that a certain Japanese newspaper claimed that Envoy Yang had been pushed from an upper floor by Russians, leading to his death. The chief editor of "睰哇" newspaper wrote an article refuting this claim with extreme and unrestrained vigor, stating roughly that when the current Emperor (referring to the Russian King) was still the Crown Prince, he had traveled to Japan and was suddenly attacked by Japanese assassins, barely escaping with his life. Furthermore, when Li Wenzhong of China was ordered to go to Maguan, Japan, to negotiate peace, he was also shot by a Japanese person, with the bullet entering his cheek, but fortunately, he did not die. Since the Japanese act with such recklessness, how can their pronouncements be trusted? This matter is recorded in "Feelings of a Trip to Russia" by Zhang Jun Fenghui, which demonstrates that the Japanese fabricating rumors is a long-standing practice, even more rampant now than in the past.</p>

<p>— Lean Scholar</p>
<p>Some worry about Ma Zhanshan, an isolated army in a remote fortress, saying he is a defeated general facing the ferocious and greedy Japanese army, so how could he be lucky? I say, you are mistaken. Everyone must die. The deaths of Xi Qia and Zhang Haipeng can be called dying for the enemy. If Ma Zhanshan dies from using up all his bullets and having no reinforcements, it can be called dying for the country. Dying for the enemy, even in death, brings eternal ridicule. Dying for the country, though dead, is like being alive, enough to inspire the hearts of those who die later and invigorate the souls of those who have not yet died, to fight the enemy to the very end. Therefore, I examine past events to encourage those in the future and to embolden those who have the responsibility to defend the land.</p>
<p>When I read the Tang Dynasty history about Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan, Yin Ziqi besieged Suiyang. The food in the city was exhausted. Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan discussed, saying, "Suiyang is the shield of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. If we abandon it, the enemy will certainly take advantage of the victory and advance swiftly, and there will be no more Yangtze and Huai Rivers. Moreover, our troops are hungry and exhausted, and running away will not get us far. It is better to hold our ground and wait for rescue." Therefore, they used tea paper as food. When that was gone, they ate horses. When the horses were gone, they trapped sparrows and dug up rats to eat. When the sparrows and rats were gone, Xun offered his beloved concubine, killing her to feed the soldiers. When the enemy climbed the city walls, the soldiers were too sick to fight. Xun bowed twice to the west and said, "My strength is exhausted. I cannot repay Your Majesty in life, but in death, I will be a vengeful ghost to kill the enemy." The city fell, and Xun and Yuan were both captured. Ziqi said, "I heard that when you fought, your eyes were cracked and your teeth were shattered. Why?" Xun said, "My ambition was to swallow the rebel thieves, but I regret that I lacked the strength to do so." He and his generals Nan Jiyun and Lei Wanchun, along with thirty-six others, were all killed. Initially, when Zhang Xun was besieged, he used the government office as a commander's hall, hanging a portrait of Emperor Gaozu and prostrating himself in tears to encourage the soldiers. His loyalty and bravery were like this.</p>
<p>When Jiang Tianyi Ming Zhang Xianzhong captured Wuchang, General Zuo Liangyu also fled east. At that time, the wolf troops rioted on the road, burning and looting everything they passed. When they were about to reach Hui, the people of Hui were terrified. A secretary named Jin Shengmou went to resist them, entrusting the troops to Tianyi. Tianyi was from Shexian County. Although he was known as a scholar, he was profound, wise, and resourceful. He originally wanted to unite the local people to defend the area. Upon receiving the order, he girded on his sword and set off on horseback in the dark of night, leading brave warriors thousands of miles to fight the rebels in Qimen, beheading the majority and seizing their cattle, horses, and weapons. Hui was thus able to turn danger into safety. In the summer of the second year of the Qing Shunzhi reign, Jiangnan was in turmoil.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>A talent bestowed by heaven, his death is also extraordinary,</p>
<p>A cloud chariot and wind horses evoke his stately appearance.</p>
<p>Thirty years of sorrow and joy, a fleeting spring dream,</p>
<p>Leaving behind a volume of poetry for the world.</p>
<p>The withering willows of Baimen lock in the slanting mist,</p>
<p>The cold drums of the Black Water move the nine borders.</p>
<p>Knowing that there is no place to die in the divine land,</p>
<p>He flew away, chanting, to shed his mortal form in the vast sky.</p>
<p>The crescent moon, slender like a brush,</p>
<p>Is pure but not frivolous, an extraordinary figure.</p>
<p>His radiance connected autumn carriages for ten miles,</p>
<p>Crying until the next of kin, his feelings already private.</p>

<p>— Zhang Sheng</p>
<p>My friend Hai Weng led students from the American Academy of Fine Arts to sketch in West Lake in mid-November, producing more than ten recent works with strong colors and majestic aura. The talent and beautiful scenery complement each other perfectly. I compose this poem to add to it.</p>
<p>I recall the Twin Peaks, leaving behind only returning geese in the vast sea. (Hai Weng returned to China from Europe only a few months ago.) The rain patters, and the boat passes Xiling. Autumn brings a misty artistic mood. I unfurl my nostalgic feelings, poetic spirit, and daring, and imbibe the heavenly charm of the bright moon and red maple leaves. Artistic companions are heroic and extraordinary. The lake light is clear and beautiful, and they murmur their heartfelt feelings by the waves. On the shores of the lonely island, there is a natural painting book, and wonderful thoughts cleanse the chest of dust. I often turn my head to the secluded charm of Nine Streams (Nine Streams and Eighteen Gorges are the most secluded scenes of West Lake) and the immortal traces of Three Peaks.</p>
<p>Looking at the previous dynasty, pens sang and ink danced. I still remember Su Gong's romantic charm. Stirring up bold feelings and the splendor of thousands of springs, moving the unrestrained spirit and the clear bells of ten thousand ages. Clouds are made into clothes, and mountains are used as lapels and belts. Wild geese fall on the horizon, and rainbows appear on the water's edge. To whom can I tell a song of the high mountains? The sea universe sighs at drifting duckweed. I envy the exquisite art of Hu Tou facing the wind, the divine craftsmanship of nature.</p>
<p>The prefectures and counties were falling like dominoes, but the people of Hui still resisted and refused to surrender. In June, the Tang domain established itself in Fuzhou. Upon hearing of Tianyi's name, they appointed him as a supervising judge. Before long, the Qing army attacked Jixi. Tianyi believed that although Hui was a strategically advantageous place, Jixi was flat and stretched out, with only one side facing the main road, so it was necessary to build a pass and gather the people to hold it back. Therefore, they built Congshan Pass. Tianyi led the troops to climb it first every morning and evening, and the enemy was afraid of him. One day, the city fell. The Qing commander urgently sought Tianyi. Tianyi knew that the situation was hopeless. He sent his mother back to Tianbiao, then opened the pass and shouted, "I am Jiang Tianyi!" When some wanted to release him, he said, "Do you think I am afraid of death?" When some said, "Your old mother is still alive, you cannot die," he laughed and said, "How can one who is working with others to save the country cherish his own life?" When he was captured and brought to Jiangning, the guards wanted to kill him. Tianyi opened his mouth and cursed, saying, "If I do not die, I will certainly rise up again with troops. It is better to kill me now." So he was killed under Tongji Gate. Before his execution, he shouted "Long live the Gao Emperor" three times, bowed twice facing south, then stretched out his neck to receive the punishment, regarding death as returning home. Those who saw it could not help but weep and soak their sleeves.</p>

<p>— Yun Sheng</p>
<p>"Non-resistance" can be interpreted as "waiting for death with folded hands." This specifically refers to foreign affairs. It does not apply to domestic affairs.</p>
<p>"(Composure)" The character "鎭" (zhen, suppress) is composed of "金" (jin, metal) and "眞" (zhen, true). It means that true gold is not afraid of fire. Let the fire burn as it may. But if the fire is too fierce, even true gold will melt, let alone something that is not true gold. The character "靜" (jing, quiet) is composed of "靑" (qing, blue/green). It means that one can compete under the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun. Otherwise, it is not allowed. This is what is called "composure."</p>
<p>"(Justice)" As the saying goes, "The public has their reasons, and the women have their reasons." But ultimately, the women's influence is less than the public's. So, the public's reasons are considered just. This is what is called "justice."</p>
<p>"(Thoroughbred Horse)" Horse refers to Ma Zhanshan. It means Ma Zhanshan, who wants to defend the thousands of miles of Heilongjiang land with an isolated army. (Self-Defense) When Country A's troops provoke incidents and arbitrarily massacre in the territory of Country B, it can all be called self-defense. Or when Country B's troops retreat in advance to preserve their strength, it can also be called self-defense. (Overthrow) This is a catchphrase, or used as decoration when written down. It does not mean actually using force.</p>
<p>"(League of Nations)" This refers to the alliance of several imperialists. It cannot be interpreted otherwise.</p>
<p>"(Shenyang)" Shen is interchangeable with Shen (審,审, to examine). Meaning to consider, to know, to understand. Yang is the sun. It means to examine the situation and know that the Japanese army will surely come.</p>
<p>"(Liaoning)" Liao means distant. Ning means peaceful. It means that if the enemy comes, those who defend this land should avoid them from afar in order to live in temporary peace.</p>
<p>"(Economic Severance)" A term relative to political severance. It means that while economic relations are severed, political relations may not be severed. (Republic of China) A term desired by the general patriotic populace. Warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians are not the populace, so it does not concern them and can be sold cheaply or presented with both hands.</p>

<h3 id="e163">A Study on Chrysanthemums That Do and Do Not Fall <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Shuo</p>
<p>Yesterday, I passed by my friend Li Junzhai's residence with a guest and saw more than a dozen chrysanthemums displayed under the steps. Those that bloomed earlier, although nearly withered, did not fall. This is the nature of this chrysanthemum. The guest said, "The chrysanthemums of Huangzhou fall," and then recited a poem by a predecessor, saying, "Only the falling petals are from the chrysanthemums of Huangzhou. The expert Jinggong admired Zizhan." This refers to when Wang Jiefu chanted about withered chrysanthemums, "The wind and rain of dusk pass through the garden, blowing golden chrysanthemums all over the ground." Su Zizhan saw this and continued, saying, "Autumn flowers do not fall like spring flowers, I report this to the poet for careful consideration." This offended Jiefu, and Zizhan was exiled to Huangzhou.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>"Haisu, I've come with two friends to see your paintings," he said. "Let me introduce them. This is Luo Longji. This is Miss Wang."</p>
<p>He himself took out the paintings I had piled on the side one by one and leaned them against the easel. He stood there frankly and looked at them. He looked at them once and talked about them several times. Every time he looked at a painting, he always said "Haisu, Haisu" using the same intimate way he would speak to a sibling. I also unknowingly felt as intimate as my brother returning home. Before long, our friend Gu Yinting came from Nanjing. He greeted Yinting as if unexpectedly meeting after a long separation. It was very natural, as if he had assimilated with nature. He also very enthusiastically called Yinting to look at my paintings. Later, everyone talked about the affairs of the Northeast and the affairs of Florence. He recalled the secrets of Florence, and he also sighed grandly about national affairs. He talked until five o'clock before he left. As he left, he said again. "Haisu, wait a while and come to my house earlier to go to Cheng Linsheng's place together for dinner to see Shi Tao."</p>
<p>Around seven o'clock, I arrived at Zhimo's house. He was shouting madly upstairs again. After sitting for a moment, Wang Wenbai also came. He brought up the matter of looking at the paintings one by one, and urged Wenbai to go and see my paintings quickly. Wenbai always dealt with him with a smile.</p>
<p>After a while, we went to Cheng's house. Walking into the house, the Japanese led the way all the way to the living room. But Mr. Cheng had not yet returned home. There were only three middle-aged gentlemen or wealthy merchants. Later, Mr. Weng led us to see the bronzes in Mr. Cheng's collection, and there were quite a few rare ones. After Mr. Cheng returned, he had a long talk with me about Shi Tao. Zhimo just listened quietly.</p>
<p>During the meal, they talked a lot about Chinese paintings and calligraphy. Mr. Cheng was very respectful to us. He and Wenbai also talked about the current economic situation in Shanghai. I am very ignorant of this passage, so I have forgotten it completely.</p>
<p>After the meal, we were full of hope. We hoped to see Shi Tao soon.</p>
<p>When Mr. Cheng unfolded Shi Tao's "Hundred Beauties" large scroll, we all stopped talking. We just watched carefully. After reading the "Hundred Beauties", we also read a dozen other hand scrolls in a row. There were landscape paintings, ink orchids, ink chrysanthemums, and Arhats. We looked at them until twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>"Excellent, excellent" we said in unison.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhu Qinglan and Cha Mianzhong came again. They also talked a lot about the affairs of Heilongjiang and disaster relief. Mr. Zhu is a real philanthropist. He is really able to petition for the people in disaster. His prestige is also very great. I think. In the past thirty years in China. There has never been such a person who can make people feel grateful. Mianzhong has also left the education business in recent years. Following Mr. Zhu to help disaster relief. Because China is a country of disasters.</p>
<p>"It's not early. It's about one o'clock. Don't just keep pestering me and not want to leave." I said this. So I, Zhimo and Wenbai said goodbye to the host and left the house.</p>
<p>. Only the chrysanthemums of Huangzhou shed their petals. Zizhan saw this and was greatly ashamed. Mr. Li then said that this incident was Ou Gong, not Su Zizhan. Jiefu chanted about withered chrysanthemums, and Ouyang Yongshu playfully continued with the line "Autumn flowers do not fall like spring flowers." Jiefu heard this and laughed, saying, "Ou Jiu is ignorant. Haven't you seen the Chu Ci has 'eating the falling petals of autumn chrysanthemums at dusk'?" I then remembered that I had seen this matter in the book "Yunlang Oubi" written by Song Muzhong. It said that he was an official in Huangzhou for several years and planted many chrysanthemums, but he had never seen any petals fall. He also examined the Huangzhou Zhi and various books on Huangzhou's customs and products, and there was no record of Zizhan seeing chrysanthemum petals fall. This is suspected to be a popular saying and not credible. However, after examining the postscript to a certain chrysanthemum manual, it says that some chrysanthemums fall and some do not. It is said that those with tightly packed petals do not fall. If the petals are sparse, after full bloom, they gradually become scattered. When shaken by wind and rain, they scatter all over the ground. Now, according to this statement, it is more credible. Due to the difference between sparse and tightly packed, there is a distinction between falling and not falling. However, if it does not encounter wind and rain shaking, even if the sparse petals are scattered, they will surely dry up and not fall quickly. This is true of chrysanthemums everywhere, not necessarily only in Huangzhou. Or it is said that the "falling petals" in the Chu Ci "falling petals of autumn chrysanthemums" should be interpreted as "beginning". Erya, "Chu Luo Quanyu" means "beginning." The "falling" in the Mao Shi also means "beginning." Therefore, it is said that the initial bloom of chrysanthemums is fragrant and lovely. After they wither, how can there be any flavor to eat? This understanding is also appropriate. However, the two characters "falling petals" are used in other books and cannot be enumerated. There is no one who uses it to mean the beginning of a flower. What is wrong with eating the falling petals of chrysanthemums to express the meaning of loneliness and purity? My friend Mr. Li also said that those with tightly packed petals do not fall, and sparse and scattered petals cannot withstand the shaking of wind and rain. Hearing this sentence, it is even more sad for our country, which is now being horizontally invaded and humiliated. Alas!</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Drums of Yuyang</p>
<p>However, the people of the Sun Country often have ambitious and far-sighted plans to develop land and relocate people. Therefore, they regard our M provinces as their territory sooner or later. They never forget it for a single day. Their country's politicians, military strategists, educators, industrialists, and merchants... it can be said that the people of the entire country never forget that they want to take this meat on the chopping board to satisfy their desires. Therefore, they try every possible means, forcefully seizing and plundering, and exhausting all kinds of methods to manage the land and seize power and profits. We only need to read their book "Tanaka Cabinet's Active Policy of Invading China and Manchuria and Mongolia" to suddenly realize and be frightened and shudder. This memorial was originally very secret, and their country's traitors stole it and sold it to us. Since this memorial was leaked, the Sun Country's aggressive ambitions have become even clearer. Not only Chinese people are shocked, but other powerful countries should also be wary. Unfortunately, Chinese people, whether in power or below, only see domestic affairs and do not care about foreign affairs. Therefore, their own people seem to have irreconcilable hatred. For twenty years, internal wars have not stopped. Brothers fight each other, losing a lot of spirit, a lot of vitality, a lot of money, a lot of lives... creating a situation with thousands of holes and dividing into four or five parts. In addition, there are floods and wailing everywhere. The people of the Sun Country took advantage of this opportunity and quickly acted. Although they could not find any excuse to send troops, they still had to act recklessly. The people of S City were originally sleeping under a pile of firewood, and disaster could happen at any time. The bed was already occupied by others who were snoring. This time, they were just the first to bear the brunt and suffer the disaster first. The military officers in the North Camp had already received orders not to resist. Because in the previous few days, the Sun Country increased its troops and transported equipment. On the surface, it was calm, but secretly, it was already mobilizing. It is a pity that at this time, our country is weak and unable to rise. How dare we talk about defense? It is like a patient lying in bed, resigned to fate. Therefore, the people of the Sun Country suddenly attacked. The soldiers in the North Camp did not resist at all. Shells rained down. Several brave soldiers, although very willing to risk their lives, resisted a little. However, the military orders were difficult to violate. Everyone had to organize and retreat. Leaving this North Camp. The troops of the Sun Country took the opportunity to pursue and kill, occupying all of our country's arsenals, mortar factories, and aircraft fields. The fire in the North Camp soared into the sky. Black smoke filled the air. It is a pity that the essence of the Northeast was reduced to ashes. Borrowing enemy troops and providing grain to thieves. It is really the most painful thing in the world. The most heartbreaking page in the history of national humiliation in the future.</p>

<p>"Oh, how affectionate. Look, you two are again..." As Mei walked into the classroom door, she saw Yi and Shu, who shared a desk with her, sitting closely side by side, talking and laughing softly, so she shouted loudly like this.</p>
<p>"Annoying," Yi said a little embarrassedly as she moved her body to the side. Shu just smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Why not annoying? Mei really likes to mind other people's business," Zhang said to Mei, raising his eyes.</p>
<p>"I like to mind other people's business?" Mei said to Yi, "This is your artistic expression... I called you to appreciate it, is that not good?"</p>
<p>"Gossip, you go and express yourself with your sleeping. Summer Saturday is coming again."</p>
<p>"No, no. You and Shu express a set first," Shun came over and said with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Express what... express your death," Yi's cheeks were already a little rosy.</p>
<p>"You can't die, turn back quickly," Zhang said, "Come, come, a sweet one... haha."</p>
<p>"A sweet one is coming, what are you doing?" Shun asked deliberately.</p>
<p>"You two understand it yourselves, you just watch,"</p>
<p>"Okay, this is your everyday meal. Come on quickly," Mei said, sticking her tongue out very quickly and retracting it.</p>
<p>"Want to die quickly..." Yi's nymph-like form was really too cute.</p>
<p>"Everyday meal. It's a little awkward in public, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Hahaha... everyday meal."</p>
<p>"Haha, hey."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>It was not until the teacher sat on the podium that this joyful sound temporarily subsided. They each made faces and returned to their desks, but this "everyday meal" had become a specific pronoun among them. Now it has spread throughout the school.</p>

<h3 id="e169">After Economic Severance with Japan <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>(1) Jianping</p>
<p>The magnitude of the effect can be known</p>
<p>Since the violent Japanese occupied my Liaoji region from September 18th, it has aroused the nationwide boycott of Japanese goods and economic severance with Japanese people in our country. For more than two months, it has caused Japanese businessmen in China to be on the verge of ruin, and the foreign trade of inferior goods, which has always regarded China as its only market, has also been fundamentally broken. Japan's trade with China is nothing less than the source of its national life. Once our country economically severs ties with it, Japan's national industries will be affected. It is not only a part of Japanese expatriate merchants in China, but also Japan's initial entire exports, which have always regarded China as their main market. No matter silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, large and small hardware, as well as various toys, utensils, sugar, and seafood, none of them account for the majority of sales in China. Therefore, inside the Yangtze River, from Xulu, Chengdu, and Chongqing in Sichuan, down to Zhenning and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, and along the river in southern and northern Anhui, Xunbu in Jiangxi Province, and Wuhan and Shayi in central Hubei, and even Changsha, Xiangtan, Changde, and Dongting in central Hunan, almost no place that can be reached by water and land is without the footprints of Japanese people. Wherever Japanese people arrive, Japanese goods are popularized to the inland. Even remote and poor villages are subject to their economic aggression. Not to mention the major trading ports. Whether it is household necessities or everyday needs in our country, all of them are replaced by Japanese goods. In ordinary families, in terms of the problem of food, there are bowls and dishes made of oriental porcelain. In terms of the problem of clothing, there are Japanese broadcloth and various silk fabrics and satin. In terms of the problem of utensils, there are Japanese umbrellas and other miscellaneous goods. Among the public goods of the society, there are even oil ink, paper, pens, hardware, rubber products, and other items. To the extreme, it can be said that from copper and iron to matches and sewing needles, there is nothing that is not available. Moreover, with low water transportation costs and light taxes, all goods coming to China are bound by unequal treaties and cannot increase their tax rates. Moreover, with the subsidies from their government, the costs can be cheapened and compete with the imported goods from other countries in China. They can naturally occupy a superior position. Furthermore, due to the sluggishness of China's industries and the immaturity of its businesses, the quality of its products is poor. As a result, the sales of Japanese goods in China have become even greater, and their trade with China has become increasingly developed.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Republic of China, Japanese people obtained the rights to five railway lines in Manchuria and Mongolia. As a result, the commerce in the Northeast was completely monopolized by them. When the European War broke out, the Japanese people took advantage of this opportunity to consolidate their rights in Manchuria and Mongolia and further seize the economic rights of the entire Shandong Province. The Twenty-One Demands were forced upon us for recognition, arousing the unanimous opposition of our country, which once boycotted Japanese goods, but it soon subsided. When the May 3rd Jinan Massacre occurred in the seventeenth year, it also aroused resistance and boycott, but it disappeared invisibly not long after. This time, the troops occupied our three eastern provinces, and the number of people killed and the gold and silver plundered cannot be calculated in numbers. Our country has a non-resistant military authority, and the people can only use economic severance as a weapon of self-defense. The Japanese pirates are not afraid of our military force, nor are they afraid of our resistance, but what they fear is the economic severance carried out by our country. The effect of the boycott is enough to put the financial lifeline of the Japanese pirates in a desperate situation. If the people of our country can be of one mind, determined and unyielding, and support the boycott of Japanese goods for one or two years, no matter how sharp the guns and cannons of the Japanese pirates are, they will only end up with exhausted finances and a weak country, and our final victory will only be possible by controlling the enemy to death through boycott and returning triumphantly. I hope that the people of our country will not be slack. The strength or weakness of the country and the survival of the nation depend on whether this economic severance can be upheld or not. Regarding the damage suffered by the Japanese pirates after the boycott, I will describe the general situation in sections below.</p>
<h3 id="e170">(1) Expatriate Businessmen Eliminated Everywhere <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>From the time the violent Japanese occupied our Northeast on September 18th to September 23rd, the people of the Yangtze River ports immediately rose up to effectively boycott Japanese goods. The initial mobilization started in Shanghai when the Wanbaoshan incident had just begun and Liaoji fell. The provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan responded in unison, severing economic ties with Japanese merchants. At first, trade was suspended, then inferior goods were inspected, and finally all industries were severed. From October 16th, the Yangtze River Basin, which the Japanese regard as deeply rooted in economic aggression in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, was fundamentally plunged into despair. In Chengdu, Chongqing, Xulu, Wanxian, and other ports in Sichuan, as well as Yichang and Shashi, Japanese merchants not only could not conduct business, but also faced obstacles in purchasing food. As a result, the Japanese merchants in the upper Yangtze River closed their businesses and withdrew from the Yangtze River Basin, moving to Shanghai. By late October, Japanese merchants in Xiang and E ports had also closed their businesses one after another. The Japanese Qing dispatched two ships to transport these Japanese expatriates to Shanghai. At the same time, the Japanese in Jiujiang, Wuhu, Daye, Anqing, and Nanjing and Zhenjiang followed suit and stopped operations, all arriving in Shanghai in late October and early November. A total of more than 800 people arrived in Shanghai one after another. Their women and children had already taken ships back to their country, while the men left some people in Shanghai. In mid-November, Japanese expatriates in Suzhou, Wenzhou, Shantou in Fujian, and Guangdong also withdrew from various ports due to the fierce boycott, going to Cai Long, coming to Shanghai, or returning directly to Dongyang. The businesses of Japanese merchants in various inland areas and the Yangtze River Basin, Nanhua, and other ports have been almost completely eliminated. What remains and has not been withdrawn is only the major ports of Shanghai and Tianjin. Since the Tianjin incident, 600 Japanese expatriates have seized four Japanese ships and will also withdraw, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e171">(II) Special Products Plummet <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Dalian Bay is the only seaport for Japan to transport goods through Manchuria and Mongolia. Most of the goods of the South Manchuria Railway are shipped from here. From October of the fifth year of the Showa era (1930) to May of the sixth year (1931), the amount of soybeans exported from Dalian Port totaled 350,000 tons, which was a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The quantities of soybean cakes, soybean oil, sorghum, and other items also gradually declined. The main reason is that the new railways built in the three northeastern provinces have gradually succeeded in encircling the South Manchuria Railway. Once Huludao Port is successfully opened, the export trade of Dalian Bay will be entirely taken back by our country's railways. Japan's all-out efforts to manage and invade Manchuria and Mongolia will be fundamentally broken. The September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) was probably a desperate measure. According to investigations, before the new railways in our eastern provinces were fully completed a year ago, various special products were transported through Dalian Port. After completion, the amount exported decreased significantly, mostly diverted and loaded from Yingkou. The comparison of special products is as follows:</p>
<p>Special Products  This Year's Shipping Volume  Last Year's Shipping Volume  Comparative Decrease</p>
<p>Corn   24,128 tons  45,467 tons  21,339 tons</p>

<h3 id="e172">(III) Japanese Goods Shipped to China Greatly Reduced <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Japan's foreign trade relies on China as its largest market, taking our raw materials and shipping manufactured goods. Japanese goods shipped to China were most prosperous in the 15th year of the Republic (1926). Since the 16th year (1927), due to the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army and the inclusion of the areas north and south of the Yangtze River into military zones, the market for Japanese goods has inevitably decreased slightly. It is found that Japanese goods shipped to our country in peacetime are mainly piece goods, cotton yarn, sugar, seafood, and other toys. In 1927, the value of goods shipped to the Northeast was 161 million yuan; in 1929, it was 215 million yuan. The value of goods shipped to North China was 103 million yuan in 1927 and 76 million yuan in 1929. The value of goods shipped to South China was 282 million yuan in 1927 and 216 million yuan in 1929. The total was 546 million yuan in 1927 and 507 million yuan in 1929. This time, the resistance to goods can be called a unanimous mobilization of the industrial, commercial, and people of the whole country. The northeastern provinces have completely stopped purchasing due to the military incidents, and North China has also successively, from September,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>stopped signing purchase contracts with Japanese merchants. Those who have already come to Shanghai are strictly prohibited from unloading by the Anti-Japanese Association. The goods that have already come to Shanghai cannot be transshipped and are accumulated to a great extent. Those that were scheduled to come to Shanghai have all failed to depart. From September to today, the Chinese and Japanese ships of the postal company have reduced the number of ships due to lack of goods to load. The Japanese imports to China that have arrived in recent days only include some Japanese stones and Western paper. In addition, the large-volume goods of some time ago, such as piece goods, yarn, sugar, and seafood, are not loaded at all. According to statistics from Japanese commercial officials in Shanghai, since the Wanbaoshan Incident in July to the present, Japan's trade with China has decreased by 76 million yuan in exports alone, and the value of Japanese gold shipments has also decreased by 18 million yuan. If we combine the national estimates, this resistance has caused Japanese goods coming to China to decrease by more than 150 million yuan, and the raw materials shipped from China have also decreased by more than 37 million yuan. The resistance of five months has been like this. If we calculate the annual total, the amount of Japanese goods shipped to China will decrease by 180 million yuan annually. According to Japanese gold calculations, the figures for trade with China have actually been completely wiped out, and its economic impact is sufficient to trigger its enormous terror.</p>
<h3 id="e173">(IV) Japanese Coal Has No Market at All <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The sales of Japanese coal in China in 1928 totaled 1.49 million tons shipped to China for sale, and in 1929, it totaled 1.33 million tons. This year, the Kailuan Coal Mine experienced a shutdown, and Shanghai suddenly faced a coal shortage. Japanese coal took the opportunity to enter the market, and the sales of Fushun coal in Shanghai were unprecedentedly smooth and in high demand. According to last year, the amount of Japanese coal shipped to China was 1,319,000 tons. At that time, Fushun coal lump No. 1 was 13.5 yuan, and No. 2 was 12.2 yuan, while Kailuan coal No. 2 screened lump was only 9.7 yuan. During the most prosperous period, Japanese coal in Shanghai was in such short supply that Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and others chartered more than 30 large Chinese, British, and Norwegian cargo ships to transport Japanese coal to Shanghai to meet the demand, and the sales market for Japanese coal increased by more than 150,000 tons per month. By September of this year, the amount of Japanese coal shipped to China had reached 2 million tons, and the Shanghai coal market had been manipulated by the Japanese. However, after the September 18th Incident, the Chinese unanimously decided not to purchase Japanese coal, and the organizing committee implemented a cessation of purchases. Since October, all factories, fields, and commercial ships have uniformly switched to using domestic coal. More than 60 coal ships of Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Dalian, and others have simultaneously stopped sailing since November, and the Ministry of Communications has heeded the request of state-owned coal mines and has not ordered the Shanghai Shipping Company to specially dispatch eight ships to Qingdao and its surrounding areas to transport domestic coal to supply factories and ships. If we can persevere to the end, the annual loss of Japanese coal shipped to China will be 26 million yuan, or more than 50 million yuan in Japanese gold converted to national currency.

<h3 id="e175">Paris Literary Reporters Association Holds Louis Veuillot Centenary Memorial <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hansu</p>
<p>October 30th of this year marks the 100th anniversary of the death of Louis Veuillot, a great modern French writer. On this day, the deceased's family and friends, along with the French Literary Reporters Association, jointly initiated a memorial service to commemorate this strong figure in the literary world, literary reporter, Catholic, and loyal writer of France from a century ago.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m., a memorial mass was held at the Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin Church in Paris. Louis Veuillot's descendants and relatives all attended the religious and solemn ceremony.</p>
<p>A moving poem, Louis Veuillot's will, was inserted into the musical program:</p>
<p>"Please place this scroll at my feet,</p>
<p>And gently close my coffin."</p>
<p>Notable among the relatives and guests were Mrs. General Bi Ai Long, Louis Veuillot's daughter; Mr. François Veuillot, the deceased's nephew; Mr. Gao Yao, President of the Louis Veuillot Friends Association; Mr. Gao Feiai, representative of the French Academy; General Castex; members of parliament; poets; novelists; and many literary reporters.</p>
<p>First, Father Chanoine, the parish priest of Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin Church, delivered a short speech. After the religious ceremony, a cornerstone laying ceremony was held at Louis Veuillot's death residence, 21 Rue de Varenne.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Yao spoke on behalf of the Veuillot Friends Association. Mr. Gao Yao delivered a very ornate eulogy to the great Catholic literary reporter who had already died. He praised Louis Veuillot as "a Catholic Voltaire, but a Voltaire with both emotion and conscience."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. François Veuillot recalled his uncle's death throes at the Rue de Varenne residence: "An old soldier of Catholicism made his last struggle here, fulfilling his duty to defend religion."</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., a rich and grand banquet was prepared, attended by well-known figures in the Paris art and literature circles and important figures in the religious world.</p>
<p>During the banquet, guests gave speeches one after another, among which the speech by Bishop Fan Nessa, an expert in the study of Veuillot's life and works, was the most popular. The guests and hosts dispersed joyfully in the middle of the night.</p>
<h3 id="e176">World-Renowned Violinist Heifetz Recital <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Among the most famous first-class violinists in today's world music scene, there are several that can be counted: Zimbalist, Szigeti, and Elman are two stars in the Northern European violin world; Kreisler is a master produced by Vienna and Paris; Thibaud is a famous French violinist. All four of them are disciples of the famous Hungarian violin teacher Auer. They have now all gained fame and are traveling the world on musical pilgrimages. They have almost all been to Shanghai to dedicate their artistic skills. Recently, another world-renowned violinist, Heifetz, held his first recital in Shanghai at the New Light Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Heifetz is a musical prodigy. He knows how to cherish his prodigy talent and does not abandon himself because of the easily obtained early fame, nor does he indulge in vanity and arrogant tricks in his youth like other artists.</p>
<p>Most music lovers like to compare the strengths and weaknesses of various famous musicians and even like to rank them. This is originally a meaningless game because violinists like Kreisler, Thibaud, Elman, and Heifetz have all achieved the status of first-class musical masters, and there is originally no such thing as first and last or first and second. They themselves are standing on a horizontal line above the same level. However, the audience inevitably has subjective observations and must, of course, make praises and criticisms.</p>
<p>If you want me to give a concise judgment on the violinists mentioned above, then I can only tell you that Kreisler is a musician of the ancient style, Thibaud is a seductive artist, Elman is a wanderer, and Heifetz is a master of musical rhythm. From the appearance, we can tell at a glance that Heifetz is a master of musical rhythm. Look at his straight posture when he takes the stage, as if he is sacred and inviolable. His facial expression is calm and there are no unnatural expressions. Many people say he is too indifferent, which is a superficial observation. I would like those audiences who specialize in watching facial grimaces or frivolous actions to close their eyes, concentrate their minds, and listen quietly. You will naturally feel Heifetz's melody, his excitement, and his liveliness. He is by no means an indifferent person. His musical rhythm is not mechanical. He has his special talent. He is a musical master. The program he played in his first recital (November 20th) was very brilliant. Vitali's "Ancient Dance Suite - La Chaconne" was very fresh and sparkling. Lalo's "Spanish Symphony" was very elegant and also very beautiful and smooth. The second part included masterpieces by Bach, Debussy, De Falla, and Ravel.</p>
<p>Heifetz is Heifetz. He has his special authority. He has the priority that others do not have. His technique sometimes pulls him too far away. On the whole, the music he played on the first night could fully express the essence of each work to the best of its ability. Bach's "Lament" is a classical work. Debussy's "The Girl with the Flaxen Hair" and De Falla's Jota are both full of Latin style. Although they lack the generosity and moderation of the classical school, they have also shed the tenderness and beauty of France and Spain, but they have a sense of evenness in the blending of light and shade.</p>
<p>Anyone who has heard Heifetz's first recital will definitely retain these beautiful impressions in their memories for a long time. La Chaconne sang the lively waltz, Ravel's "Wandering Song" sobbed sadly, and Lalo's "Scherzo" emitted a very light and decisive sparkling light.</p>
<p>The pianist Achron's playing technique was very expressive, but unfortunately the audience could not hear it clearly, especially when accompanying the "Spanish Symphony," he played too softly.</p>

<p>"Do men buy books?"</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>This question was recently raised by a reporter from a London newspaper because the reporter said that according to a report from a friend in the book industry, all the customers buying books in London recently are women.</p>
<p>A man can spend a pound without hesitation on small drinks, small snacks, or in the theater, but when it comes to taking out a few shillings to buy books, he seems unwilling. But in the same newspaper that published this question, they made a broad solicitation to the London book industry in their own newspaper. As a result, there was a fair explanation for whether men buy books and whether men are stingy with their money when buying books. Although the reports from the bookstores said that most of the customers who come to buy books are women, they also reported that these customers have different interests in buying books. They said that generally, when a man buys books, he always buys some useful books. Their attitude towards buying books is very serious. If they really want to buy, then the amount spent is greater than that of women. Most women buy books just to casually buy some to pass the time, while men love to buy some permanently useful books that are permanently worth putting on their shelves.</p>
<p>The Croydon Public Library in London makes a detailed report on its annual book supply statistics every year. According to this year's report, it seems that the demand for reading and borrowing those stimulating and easily arousing novels is very small among the books borrowed out each year. The readership of war works has also fallen sharply. Only classical books still maintain their original position, probably because the masses are too tired and bored of war. But on the one hand, although this is the case, books on war history and other categories still have a considerable market. Winston Churchill wrote in the fifth volume of "The World Crisis" published in 1929: "The materials in this volume were almost all collected by me within ten years and have many of the freshest contributions to the history of the last war." The publishing company of this book announced that it plans to continue with another sequel, a sequel of 130,000 words. This sequel may be called "The Unknown War," writing about matters on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>The twelfth and final volume, the thirteenth volume, of "The Medical History of the War" published by the Stationary Office will also be published soon. This is compiled by the official side, and another book "The Fifth Army" written by General Hebegu may cause a stir for a while because this book will reveal all the most important inside stories. In terms of content, there are many places that involve the reputation of some high-ranking politicians and military personnel.</p>
<p>There are still many books of this kind to be published, such as Plain's "In the Life of War," etc., now in the London publishing world.</p>
<p>Following war novels, the most active books in the London publishing world are biographies. Many people are discussing this issue more vigorously than discussing all literary issues. Professor Blair is compiling a great dictionary of national biographies. Shatai Lee said that literary success must have something unusual to show in the book. Today's biographical works are generally too ordinary. Many people are becoming interested in these works. Readers buy them regardless of whether these things are worth reading, and they keep buying them one by one.</p>
<p>A female writer, Jameson, told people that she can only write 500 words a day, from 9:30 in the morning to 7:30 in the afternoon. Excluding the time for eating in these ten hours, if each hour is divided, then 50 words are not enough to calculate. She is the smallest and slowest writer.</p>

<p>Simon &amp; Schuster will publish a biography about George Bernard Shaw in October of this year. This book is written by Frank Harris and is considered to be the most brilliant biography of the season. This book will completely collect Shaw's life's work and his writings. The author said that in this book, he will tell you all the truth about Shaw. The materials collected in this book are very new and have letters and other pictures and photos directly written by Shaw to the author, it is said.</p>
