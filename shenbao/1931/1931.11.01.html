<h3>太平洋國際學會之展望</h3>
<p>太平洋國際學會自上月二十一日在上海開幕今瞬將閉會當太平洋上之局面陷於非常悲觀沉非常不太平之際太平洋國際學會諸代表竟能歡聚一堂「太平」集會「太平」討論「太平」研究兹且又將「太平」閉會此種和平之精神與雍容謙恕之學者態度誠足欽式嚮使太平洋上各國家都能如太平洋學會諸代表之和平謙恕則太平洋之能確保永久太平當無可疑</p>
<p>當太平洋學會開幕之初吾人即風聞會議中將不討論「東北問題」繼經該會理事長葛林聲明謂非不討論特不作專案討論此旬餘來大會所討論者爲沿太平洋各國之商業問題中國之經濟發展外交機關食糧與人口問題人種與移民問題等學術上之問題直至最近兩日始曾討論及當前東北「不太平」之事實意者該會爲顧慮會議之因討論「不太平」之事實而致精神上之「不太平」以傷及其學者之態度與禮貌故苦心籌劃極力避免正面的討論事實上維持會議的始終此種維持「會議和平」之苦心孤誼不讓於國際聯盟會議中各國政治家外交家爲維持「國際和平」之焦思與苦慮此種苦心尤有足多者</p>
<p>聞昨前數日該會數組提出「東北問題」之際中日兩國代表爭論頗烈日本代表仍本其一貫之態度與主張謂日人嘗謁其血與財産以從事生産並發展其滿蒙利益並謂此問題不僅限於其冗長而繁複之事實且尙有熱烈的感情關係此種抹殺事實之「權益論」吾人固己習聞然而於此則實足證日本代表之純爲日本帝國主義之代言人或辯護者其無誠意於中日關係之改善以及國際局勢之安全蓋照然共見據聞英美各國代表對於日本之暴行固一致腹非對於中國頗能予以精神上之同情但亦不過腹非與同情而己至於敢依據事實仗義執言作公允之論列者蓋亦鮮見</p>
<p>夫東北當前之事實不僅迫害中國之領土行政神聖之主權見予世界和平以極嚴重之威脅蓋極顧而易見誰爲事變之禍首誰爲迫害世界和平之責任者應亦路人皆知太平洋國際學會原本以聯絡國際感情謀各國之互相了解致太平洋上之永久太平爲目的此次列席會議之代表又皆爲各國之俊彦顧乃於此當前之嚴重事實不能打破國家與種族之成見基於公理開誠佈公評判當前事實之是非並求所以改善其將來學者之態度尙如此則政治家外交家之縱横捭闔各爲其本國之利益而奮鬥而掠奪抑何足怪就該會之性質而言固僅能討論絶無權决議但依據事實之公允討論至少亦可以表示公理尙未完全毁滅人類尙未至重迫洪流併此公允之討論而不可得利害相關者則斷斷而爭其無關者則默默而息斯則該會亦不過滑稽喜劇之又一幕耳</p>
<p>該會此次準備集會之初幾經波折蓋非偶然兹後如不能改變其敷衍周旋之態度以積極的精神從事於正確事實的體認興分析則「曲高和寡」恐終無以博得世界之同情此次提出「東北問題」之數代表着目於世界之和平趨重於事實之討論其勇氣頗有足多其討論而無結果者則爲事實之必然並非偶然然亦正以此而愈顯該會前途之黯淡無光耳</p>

<h3>十六省水災救濟意見書（續）</h3>
<p>五曰貸種、水災之後此爲一重要問題、農民被水種子全無秋春不種即無收穫、振期必致延長、又從何處籌此振欵、故必須盡力於貸種方法、民六河北各縣曾設有籽種貸借所四十九處、但此項種子、必須就地或鄰縣鄰村購集應可以合地宜、尤不可用北方各省及美國之麥種、因其地質不適、反致難以生出、則貽誤耕期、最爲大害也、</p>
<p>六曰保牛、水災之後耕户之牛、難以保存、故必須立耕牛保存所但須注意者、水草不良、發生瘟疫、反因傳染盡斃、有失保存之意而數月之間、喂養之費、亦多損失、似不如由保存所設法利用、當此大災之時、運用振品、不妨利用牛車、爲之輪送、旣可散而不聚、免遭染疫、又可不致徒縻飼養之費、</p>
<p>七曰老弱留養水災之後、屋字盡圯、老弱流離、旣爲可憫、有父母雖存或因乏食而　其子女者有全家淹斃僅存弱息者、人類之無告、要以此爲最也、是宜廣設留養所以重人道、而昭惻隱民六河北各縣、曾設有老弱留養所一百八十一處、全活數萬餘人、此次災區旣廣當更十倍於此數也、</p>
<p>八曰粥廠、難民乏食、不免流亡、流亡之苦、甚至聚集爲亂、尤於治安影響甚巨、應由各縣籌資設立粥廠、俾之就食本鄉較易謀生、民六河北各縣、曾自設有粥廠五百九十三處、全活數十萬人生命、不獨足救一時之急並可免流離散失之患凡老弱不能做工及留養者、均賴此爲調濟也</p>
<p>九曰義振、災區廣大、必須約請慈善團體爲之襄助以濟政府力量之所不及、民六河北水災得南方各善團來振者數十餘會、共集振欵一百餘萬元、約及政府振欵三分之一、故督辦處爲之設立着團聯合會、討論辦法量其振欵之多寡、指配災區之輕重、不足者則由政府補助欵多者則請其獨任一縣、並於善團未來之前放振人員則爲之預寄乘車免票、運送振品、則爲之交涉免費車輛及發給免稅護照旣來之後、派員赴站招待所往各地方又派員隨同照料、務使其利便滿足、無有絲毫之留難、是以各善團踴躍而前此次各省亦應照此辦理方可以需策羣力也、總之災區廣大、不能全恃中央與地方之財力與人力、古有曰、十室之邑、必有忠信、又曰人之欲善、孰不如我凡一省不被災之縣凡一縣不被災之村、均應設法奬勸或附加捐、或個人輸集少成多、災民固實受其賜、而脸民復各表其同情互助之心響影於社會道德、至重且大也、</p>
<p>（三）汪重工賑前工賑、自以馬路與河堤易於興工、只須有欵、即可立辦至於改良河道之治本問題、必須經長時間之測量、及多年雨量流量之記載、乃可以定規畫而無流弊何况此次大災、江淮湖河、同時潰溢、人力與財力、均不易於解决也擬有一項、條例如下</p>
<p>一曰限制修堤、前清時、關於湖田沙出均有限制、分爲官圍民圍私圍一種、其有碍於水道者、則由地方官履勘禁止、或即拆去、不准再築、按年由督撫奏報一次定例固甚嚴也、自後政治廢弛、親爲具文民國以來地方官視爲利藪、設局放墾、湖田沙出、日以增加、水道遽曁、致有此次之人災、今除有關水患必應修築之堤外、爲洽標計、應飭令各省按照前清規定之限制地叚、己潰者暫不准其再築、其有數畝小農、恃以爲生者、政府易給官田、其有稍大地主、或給地方公債、以爲交換、照此辦法、亦可得數年之安定、較勝於籌撥巨欵以修堤也、</p>
<p>二曰　濬溝洫、長江下游省分、如江北一帶地本低窪、儲水難消、固爲水害、然亦可利用之以興水利、如江南之蘇常杭嘉河汊紛歧、灌漑通暢、交通便利是也、今於高寗興三縣地方、似可廣開網形之溝洫、旣可儲水以備旱、又可洩水以消害、將　壞變爲　腴不亞於蘇常杭嘉也、</p>
<p>三曰交換地畝、水流就下、乃其天然之性故於各河流、　必有其低漥之湖泊以蓄水量而役水勢、然逐年不洽、則必有南高北徙、北高南徙之趨勢昔年治理北方河工、即查知大清子牙各河、向以東淀　停蓄之湖泊、自水定河潰入大清後、東　日淤、遂令地勢最低之文安、變爲沼澤當時若有毅力之官吏、即以東淀高地與文安人民、兩相交換人民旣免年年受災、久居卑濕之苦大清各河亦有漾儲蓄之地、實舉而兩便也今如江北水災、自由洪睪各湖之淤墊所致、若以興化比文安、洪澤各湖比東淀兩相交換、其費旣省、民亦得安矣希齡於南方地形鮮所研究、不知此舉、是否可行、姑爲言之、以備參考、當此災情孔迫、國難方殷之際、籌欵旣非容易治本又不可能只有擇其輕者急考治之於目前、置其重者緩者留之於異日也、抑希齡尤有進者、尙有三端、</p>
<p>二辦賑要義、首須縮小災匾、因初報災狀之時、均由地方總括大槪繼而調查、有被水未久而即涸者有被禍未深而可删者、如民六河北水災、初報災民人數有六百餘萬名、迨至詳加審核、約有百數十萬人須給賑欵、災區縮小、自可易於救濟、至於災期尤宜縮短、今秋農民能得竹種麥明春即可有食、明春能得種榖、明秋即可得食不致再爲長期之救濟也</p>
<p>（二）發行公債應以人民心理爲標準、舊時賑災公債、據報載巿價每百元只售三元若再發行三千萬未必有人喜購、似應一律照普通公債發行、不必名爲賑災公債、只須具有確實担保爲要旨耳、</p>
<p>（三）辦理賑務機關及人員、其行政經費與薪水應均由國庫項下支給、不得徒盡義務、亦不可動用民捐庶足以恤人情而昭信用、民六河北督辦處即本此意若能調用各部署人員辦理賑務仍支原薪更可省費矣、</p>
<p>以上各節、卑之無甚高論、不過就其己往之經騐以貢獻於左右、是否有當、乞賜卓裁無、在感　熊希齡、</p>

<h3>九十分鐘驚險東華安然無恙</h3>
<p>零比零和諾林堡</p>
<p>周賢言大顯神通</p>
<p>－史高托杯初賽之一幕－</p>
<p>東華足球隊昨日重逢英軍諾森堡、於中華棒球場、作史高托杯第一週賽九十分鐘大戰結果零比零各無所得打成和局改日重賽、東華全局、處於猛烈壓迫之下然周賢言李寗輩、偉大精神、堅持抗拒、得安然和局而、終裁判員李諾斯、</p>
<h3>一萬人之驚喜</h3>
<p>棒球場昨日客滿當、在一萬人以上、本季之新紀錄見東華之危、不禁同聲呌險曾有三次連呼」喔喔喔」者、想見當時情景、助東華之進攻、則又歡聲雷動也、</p>

<p>洛士美麥迪遜</p>
<p>鮸恩楊格</p>
<h3>零比零之由來</h3>
<p>大戰九十分鐘、竟各一無所得、可謂棋逢敵手矣所以然者、有由來也、諾森堡雖大施攻擊、、無奈失之過急、而脚頭不準、失去者不少、東華則周鐵門加倍努力、李寗坐鎭後關、諾軍因此望門生嘆東華忙於守、有時進攻、前鋒差欠合作失之稍緩、亦空手歸來乃成○○之比</p>
<h3>昨日之東華隊</h3>
<p>東華隊昨戰、後衞自屬吃重、李寗從容救險、不知其數、屠開元庸庸無所見、陣璞時有失球、家球滿意、前鋒最爲失望戴經麟陳洪光無所發展、李義臣更次之、錢敬鏞覺經騐差欠、胆量尙小、及門不敢攻、爲敵阻去不少、但落點甚佳、前途大有希望總之昨日之合作大差於是球皆在英軍脚上、尙有一最要點、中衞線忙於顧敵、於是不能接濟前鋒、線攻力頓時大减、此亦敵方攻力過强、有以致之、</p>
<h3>最可怕之兩脚</h3>
<p>英軍之後衞線、大爲增色、失脚不見尤可驚者、球在諾軍門前、經後衞之一脚、飛過中線、中堅加送一脚直逹東華門前大有二脚可制東華死命之槪脚頭之硬、一時罕見、惜失之射門不準確、東華則必經過若干之傳遞、拼命之奔跑、方逹敵門、、一經阻住、全功盡棄、論實力英軍自較强也</p>
<h3>周鐵門顯神通</h3>
<p>諾軍開球後、東華十分鐘中即見險象、一度進攻不成、諾軍猛施反擊、薛特爾直進、關洵安救成角球幸告無恙、包滿遠送一球、李寧跳起一頂、包滿趕上一送、薛特爾全力踼入網去、周賢言眼快手快、一撲倒地、斜托拍出、球砰然出、其險有如此者、其後包滿送球至海列生、周賢言見來勢不佳己奔出在外、薛特爾一脚、亦未入門、無不額手稱慶、上半時之險球、不一而足、下半局開始東華形狀漸佳、曾進攻數次、其勢甚順、漸漸諾軍又來、戴中鋒一次截得一球、急遠挑左角錢敬鏞向内一勾、五虎齊進陳虞添加上一脚羣圍攻諾門在線前二三尺、一送即進而諾之守門受傷倒地、將球撲住、鳴笛而散、其後英軍雖再攻、然周賢言鑒局勢之危、更細心不亂、卒至和局而終、</p>

<p>抗日之聲</p>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>分道揚鑣。險些兒閱牆爭鬥的寗粤兩方·現在因爲倭奴入寇國勢阽危·各派代表來商洽和平統一了。全國民衆在此時期。那個不是掬着十二分的熱誠。希望早日實現和平统一。一致從事對抗暴日。可是兩方相見以來。進行方面。依然非常遲緩。尤其是那和議的地點。在京在滬。各執一見在兩方雖都有不得己的苦衷。個當此國難臨頭。千鈞一髮。甚麽都應化除意見。開誠佈公在京是救國。在滬也是救國。何必苦苦相持。有人說。兩方爲了地點爭執。或許終於决裂。這話令人多麽寒心。甚望此言之不中。而早日團結精神。共同對外。那才是中國之福呀。</p>

<h3>化磁爲電</h3>
<p>我們看了法拉第的故事心中總不免要問問「他的發電機是怎樣發明的呢？」</p>
<p>一八二○年法拉第的老師，戴斐Davy在一根軟鐵的周圍通了一個電流·竟把它變成一塊磁石。一八二二年法拉第在自己的筆記簿上寫着：</p>
<p>「我當化磁爲電。」</p>
<p>發電機便是從這様一個决心裏創造出來的。戴斐旣能化電爲磁，我怎麽不能化磁爲電，這便成了法拉第今後之抱負。</p>
<p>一八三一年十月十七日偶然得到一根四分之三黄吋直徑，八英吋半長的根磁。他用了二十二丈的銅綫繞成一個圓筒。在這銅綫上他接了一個電流針。　　他把磁石的一端放近銅綫電流針絲毫不受影響，指針一點兒也不動。他把磁石忽然穿入銅綫繞的圓筒。針立刻轉動他又把磁石忽然抽出，針又轉動。這便是破天荒之誘導電流InducedCurrent之發明。凡導體運動時能横截磁力綫則生誘導電流。這裏面的奥妙便是運動横截。導體不運動即運動而不横截磁力都産生不出電流。</p>
<p>從此法拉第便根據個原理進行他的機器之創造。他把一個圓的銅盤之邊緣放在一塊蹄磁兩極之間，用銅片鋁片使和盤之邊緣接觸並將電流計接起來銅盤一轉電流即通。這便是一個小小的發電機這個小小發電機便是現化電化文明之泉源。</p>
<h3>抗日聲中亟應創設細紗工廠之我見</h3>
<p>— 周才良</p>
<p>原夫對日經濟绝交。乃爲我國民不得己而行之之一法。試觀彼國砲艦之疊來示威。亦可見此事之久必有效。惟自抵制迄今。爲期僅逾二月而我國貨工廠之以停業聞者己比比皆是在廠主固突遭巨損。而勞工亦有失業之虞。是則抵制之結果。豈非有類乎自殺。天下至愚之事孰逾於此余嘗推考其故。廼始知其癓結所在。蓋我國各工廠（尤以針織業爲最）平日之賴以經營者。幾皆爲彼方所出之原料。今不幸來源告絶。竟致俱無辦法。足見仰人鼻息之營業終不可恃。故爲懲前毖後計。則不得不有下列各項之建議。（甲）組織方法衣著旣爲我人日常所必需則如針織業之原料—「細纱」。自當亟爲解决。鄙意此事應由該同業聯合發起。從速組織成立一大規模之細紗工廠。即定名爲「上海針織業製造細紗工廠」。</p>
<h3>向東北看</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>當此國難聲中。對外救亡之不暇而猶有和平兩字之呼籲。聞於域内。噫、眞令人欲哭無涙也。憶昔某要人有「向左走」之口號。吾今以「向東北看」四字易之。倘亦閱之。而怦然有動於衷歟。</p>
<p>咄咄東鄰子肆虐無人道。侵龔我遼吉。如入小城堡旣據此要隘。復刦彼財寳。奸淫又擄掠不問小與老。任他逞兵威。殺之如菅草膏血塗原野。屍骨遺芻藥。可憐刦餘生。哀鳴形枯槁。隻身出虎窟。性命幾不保。偏遇胡匪來。刦車似蕩掃。嗟吾罹難者。婦孺或襁褓。值此歲寒時。衣食失寒煥。苟有悲憫心。痌癏在懷抱。况念國步艱。雙方宜和好。吾民喜苟安。和平呼籲早。豈待至今日。尙欲共研討。國難己臨頭。不容互嫉捐。對外須一心。聖訓可參考。同室而操戈。無異爭梁稻。禦侮失長城。思痛餘懆懆。要知彼倭。奴乘我水旱潦。再不自悔禍。危卵恐難葆。蕞爾野心者。何日能打倒。及今深自思。掬出良心禱。哲必衞吾國。撲滅此羣獠。旣可對人民。那怕扶桑島。英雄豈有種。成敗在蒼昊。一戰而能克。山河自改造。不然日相爭。到底爲隸皂。一念亡國慘。憂心實如擣。試問誰之咎。我先開口道。千秋與萬世。。厥罪莫洗澡。哀哉吾當軸。盍各懺悔蚤。</p>
<p>其内部管理。務取嚴格。而各項設備。尤須應用最新式之科學。俾費省而獲效巨。藉可卜發展於將來。</p>
<p>（乙）籌集資金該廠旣由同業發起而成。股本自當均匀派認假使全巿大小同業約以三千家計如每家平均派認洋二千元則其總數己有六百萬元之鉅即以此數之半。購辦各項機械原料及招僱技師之用。其餘則應存諸銀行。保管生息。以爲他日逐步發展之需</p>
<p>（丙）出品種類關於出品方面。現爲抵制日貨供應現銷計。姑以四十二支六十支細紗爲標準。嗣後經營得法。自當漸謀、擴充。除自給外。須致力於向外發展。而在廠服務人員。亦當各念所負使命之重大益宜隨時警惕。。研求進步。如是則國貨前途庶幾有豸</p>
<p>以上云云。不過就其犖犖大者而言。若夫詳細規劃。則尚有待語云。「千載一時之良機。稍縱即逝。」未知熱心愛國之針織業諸君。其亦有意於斯乎</p>

<h3>談談綠氣砲及其防避法（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳羽伯</p>
<p>日前申報電訉。。載有東省日軍己運到毒氣砲多尊之說國人鑒於暴日之慘酷無人道之種種破壞國際公約的行爲。以及用飛機炸彈轟擊無抵抗的中國城巿等舉動因以推測日軍難保無此種違背海牙公約第一章第二十三條之事實發生。（該條即係禁用致人於死之毒氣作爲武器）值此人心皇皇之際。我輩略有一知半解者。不可無一二言以供親愛的國人爲事先的綢繆事後的參考</p>
<p>我國在數十年前。即知有所謂綠氣砲。故至今對於任何毒瓦斯皆稱作綠氣砲。此項俗稱也算錯。也算不錯。何以呢。原來綠氣祗係五六十種毒瓦斯中之一種且施放毒氣。並不限於野砲一種大器。尤以綠氣之施放係用雲狀放射法。即以圓筒貯藏該氣。順風散佈。故綠氣砲之稱是錯的。但在歐戰中雖然毒瓦斯之種類日有發明。其毒力逾綠氣十倍百倍的何止數十種。但就實際上之使用而言因綠氣之製造較簡出産較多。施行又稍爲便利一點。比起他種價昂而製造頗不易的毒氣來得容易供給。故比較之下仍以綠氣用在戰塲上用得最多。（歐戰约用二萬噸其次是福斯珍約用一萬五千噸。再次就是毒氣大王芥子瓦斯用一萬一千噸。）施放起來所用的圓筒和砲的形式差不多。故我們籠統稱牠作綠氣砲。也可算不錯我們如欲防禦這種毒氣先要把各種毒氣的名稱和種類弄清楚。不過這不是短短的篇幅所能說得明白的。大槪說來毒瓦斯分爲四種。一種是致死性的。例如綠氣·福斯珍·（又名光氣）等第二種是催涙性的祇要在空氣中夾雜了極小的小量。（譬如千萬分之一的比例）就能令吾人流涙稍爲濃一點就令吾人目痛·嘔吐·氣閉·甚或致命。此種毒劑係以臭素爲主要物質。而與他物化合而成第三種爲噴嚏性瓦斯。係以砒素爲主要物質。空氣中混了。少許。就令人發生噴嚏·嘔吐。這種毒氣是歐戰後斯始發明。因爲這種砒劑化合物多係極微細之粒子。爲面具所不阻禦。第四種呌發泡性或稱糜爛性瓦斯。吾人稍爲用手指或足指沾了一小滴。祇須針尖大。就可以呌吾人致死。這就是毒氣大王芥子瓦斯了。放射毒氣的法子。用大砲將毒氣裝在砲彈内。或用飛機將毒氣裝在油槽内飛到空中撒布或者藉着風勢放散。至於手溜彈·以及大炸彈·俱可裝塡毒氣。且不必靠着風勢。即可放到敵人陣内。凡在嫌疑之際。吾人忽嗅到一種特别氣味。（芥子具·腐敗具·剌鼻具·肥料具·）同時有人發生流涙·噴嚏或眼痛·等情形知道便是適人施放毒氣了。</p>

<h3>鄉下人又到上海（三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄉下人想··原來他一瞧我的様子，就不像是坐頭二等車的人了。他們的眼睛眞厲害。</p>
<p>「那末三等車票在那裏買的呢」</p>
<p>「在隔壁那個窗洞裏。」警察漸漸有點詞色温和起來了。「你不瞧見票子都各分顔色··三等車是藍色票二等車是白色票，頭等車是紅色票，那可明白了。」</p>
<p>鄉下人的確没有坐過頭二等車現在倒蒙這位警察先生的指點使，他長了一點知識。他自己買好了一張票了以後，又躱在那邊瞧人家買票子，果然有的是買了白票子，有的是買了紅票子。但是看到後來，祗見一個人，買一張票子，兩邊是白的，中間却是紅的，他就疑惑起來了，這到底算是頭等車票呢？還是二等車票呢？</p>
<p>他想問問那穿黄衣服的人，那穿黄衣服的人又懶懶地走開了。他總想解除這個疑惑，便跟了這個買紅白票的人，問道··</p>
<p>「朋友－你買的是什麽票？」</p>
<p>「月台票－你管他什麽？」那人很詫異鄉下人的問他。他大槪是來送一個朋友的，急怱怱的走了</p>
<p>可是鄉下人依然没有明白</p>
<p>「什麽呌做月台票？」他獨自忖思··「難道火車上還有看月亮的地方？還有屋頂花園嗎？」</p>
<p>旣而恍然大悟··「對了對了－不是上次從上海回來，看見有許多人站在頭等車和二等車之間嗎？頭等是紅票，二等是白票他們在頭二等之間，所以那個票子也有紅有白，這個地方，大槪就是月台了呢？」</p>
<p>他自己解釋了這個欵問，心裏頓然一寛。走出了鐵栅門，己見有許多人站在那裏</p>
<p>却見一個人，衣服穿得很特别。這樣的大熱天，穿了一身灰色布的衣裳，背上還斜背了一條皮帶，又不背什麽絲，要這條皮帶何用。天又不下雨，穿了那雙似套褲一股長的皮靴悶不通風，眞不怕熱。皮腰帶上，還有一個一個銅圈圈，。掛掛旱烟荷包，鑰匙，扇袋之類，倒也便當。最奇怪的這樣熱天還要戴手套。領頭上一排的泡頭釘，想是在人家石庫門上剥下來的。</p>

<h3>棉巿平疲</h3>
<p>棉巿平疲、因美棉趨勢軟化而銀價日長、金巿虚弱以致外棉採算銀盤較爲低廉、故有一部份廠商購印棉套出標準、形勢略疲、然漢帮及一部份多頭、視各路來源凋敝本月份軋空心思異黨濃密購意仍堅、然現棉交易極其岑寂、各廠均無進意因外棉吸收飽滿之故也、所以大户仍抱逢漲抛出之傾向、不過目前難以大跌云、</p>

<h3>China Sends Note to League of Nations Refuting Japanese Statement</h3>
<p>"All Difficulties Can Be Resolved if Japan Withdraws Troops as Scheduled"</p>
<p>Nanjing Today, the Special Foreign Affairs Committee telegraphed Shi Zhaoji, instructing him to submit a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, refuting the Japanese statement.

<p>Following the close of the League of Nations Council meeting in Nanjing, the Japanese side has shown no indication of accepting the League of Nations resolution and implementing troop withdrawal. Recently, they have falsely accused Soviet Russia of sending troops to Manchuria, attempting to expand the scope of the dispute. Using the pretext of rampant banditry in Liaoning and Jilin, they are increasing troops on the Siping-Taonan Railway and other routes. While Soviet Russia has formally denied sending troops, our side has also instructed Shi Zhaoji, who is temporarily staying in Geneva, to inform the League of Nations of Japan's conspiracy and facts of deliberately creating an unstable situation in the Northeast, urging them to pay attention. There is a possibility that the Council may convene earlier than scheduled. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Hostility Toward England</h3>
<p>Rumors in Tokyo of a Secret Sino-British Treaty</p>
<p>Tokyo There are currently various rumors in Tokyo regarding the current relationship between China and England, claiming that China and England have concluded a secret treaty. This news, coupled with the secrecy surrounding the terms of the Thomson case resolution, has aroused much suspicion and heightened Japanese hostility toward England. When the Manchurian issue was discussed in Geneva, the Japanese people considered the attitude of the British representative on the League of Nations Administrative Council unfriendly towards Japan, which sparked anti-British sentiment. Today, various Japanese newspapers are even more resentful of England, pointing out that Britain wants to win China's favor. Local radio broadcasts are spreading alarming news about England. Even Japanese people who previously expressed goodwill towards England now feel disappointed due to England's unfriendly attitude towards Japan. The Asahi Shimbun, known for its moderate commentary, published an article today stating that the British representative adopted a clearly malicious and unfriendly attitude towards Japan during the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. Thirty years of Anglo-Japanese friendship are about to disappear. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Outlook of the Pacific International Studies Association</h3>
<p>The Pacific International Studies Association, which opened in Shanghai on the 21st of last month, is about to close. At a time when the situation in the Pacific is in a very pessimistic and unstable state, representatives of the Pacific International Studies Association were able to gather happily, "peacefully" convene, "peacefully" discuss, and "peacefully" research. Now, they are about to "peacefully" close the meeting. This spirit of peace and the demeanor of scholars with generosity and humility are truly worthy of admiration. If all countries in the Pacific could be as peaceful and humble as the representatives of the Pacific Association, then there would be no doubt that the Pacific could be ensured of lasting peace.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Pacific Association's opening, we heard rumors that the meeting would not discuss the "Northeast Problem." Subsequently, the chairman of the association, Mr. Green, clarified that it was not that it would not be discussed, but that it would not be discussed as a special item. For more than ten days, the conference has discussed commercial issues of various Pacific countries, China's economic development, diplomatic organs, food and population issues, race and immigration issues, and other academic issues. Only in the past two days did it begin to discuss the current "unstable" situation in the Northeast. It seems that the association, out of concern that discussing the "unstable" situation would lead to spiritual "instability" and harm its scholarly attitude and courtesy, painstakingly planned and tried to avoid direct discussion. In fact, it maintained the conference from beginning to end. This kind of painstaking effort to maintain "conference peace" is no less than the anxious and painstaking efforts of politicians and diplomats from various countries in the League of Nations to maintain "international peace." This kind of painstaking effort is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>It is reported that in the past few days, when several groups of the association raised the "Northeast Problem," the representatives of China and Japan argued fiercely. The Japanese representatives still adhered to their consistent attitude and proposition, saying that the Japanese people have shed their blood and invested their property to engage in production and develop their interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. They also said that this problem is not only limited to its lengthy and complicated facts, but also has passionate emotional connections. We are already accustomed to this kind of "rights theory" that obliterates facts. However, it proves that the Japanese representatives are purely spokespersons or defenders of Japanese imperialism. It is obvious to all that they have no sincerity in improving Sino-Japanese relations and ensuring the security of the international situation. It is reported that the representatives of Britain and the United States unanimously disapproved of Japan's atrocities and were quite able to sympathize with China spiritually. However, they were only disapproving and sympathizing. As for those who dared to speak out righteously based on the facts and make fair comments, they were rarely seen.</p>
<p>The current situation in the Northeast not only persecutes China's territorial administration and sacred sovereignty, but also poses an extremely serious threat to world peace. It is extremely obvious. Who is the culprit of the incident and who is responsible for persecuting world peace should be known to everyone. The Pacific International Studies Association originally aimed to connect international sentiments, seek mutual understanding among countries, and achieve lasting peace in the Pacific. The representatives attending the meeting this time are all elites from various countries. However, regarding this serious current situation, they cannot break national and racial prejudices, and based on justice, openly and fairly judge the rights and wrongs of the current situation and seek to improve its future. If the attitude of scholars is still like this, then how can one not be surprised by the politicians and diplomats who maneuver and fight and plunder for the interests of their own countries? As far as the nature of the association is concerned, it can only discuss and has no right to make decisions. However, a fair discussion based on facts can at least show that justice has not been completely destroyed and that humanity has not been reduced to a catastrophic flood. If even this fair discussion is not possible, then those with vested interests will argue vehemently, while those who are not concerned will remain silent. Then the association is nothing more than another scene of a slapstick comedy.</p>
<p>The fact that the association's preparations for this meeting have gone through several twists and turns is not accidental. If it cannot change its perfunctory attitude and engage in the recognition and analysis of correct facts with a positive spirit in the future, then "a high tune attracts few singers," and it may ultimately fail to win the sympathy of the world. The several representatives who raised the "Northeast Problem" this time focused on world peace and emphasized the discussion of facts. Their courage is commendable. The fact that the discussion was fruitless is inevitable and not accidental. However, it is precisely because of this that the association's dark and bleak future is highlighted.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Proposal for a One-Year Armaments Truce</h3>
<p>Only Eleven Countries Have Notified Acceptance</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st: The United States, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and other countries have now accepted the League of Nations' proposal for a one-year suspension of armaments construction. Italy undertakes that if other countries make the same promise, Italy's armaments construction can also be suspended for one year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Brussels, 31st: The Belgian Foreign Minister stated today that Belgium is willing to participate in the armaments truce.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th: The United States telegraphed Geneva yesterday, accepting the League of Nations' proposal for a one-year armaments truce, but with reservations, namely, that the truce does not apply to warships currently under construction or already ordered. Therefore, the United States can still freely continue to build seven 10,000-ton cruisers carrying 8-inch guns, three submarines, one aircraft carrier, and five destroyers. Furthermore, what the United States accepts does not refer to the replacement of old or old ships and aircraft within one year. According to this interpretation, the United States can rebuild six destroyers and several other small ships.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 31st: The Italian proposal to suspend the arms race for one year, after being passed by the League of Nations Council, must be declared acceptable by the member states before midnight on Sunday in order to be implemented. So far, only the United States, Japan, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and a few other countries have notified the League of Nations Secretariat of their acceptance. If the remaining 40 or so countries do not notify within the next 36 hours, the proposal will be shelved. In addition, only 22 countries have reported on the preparations for the disarmament conference, and most of them are vague and general, with no practical value at all, which is equally disappointing.</p>
<h3>British Colonial Secretary Refuses to Leave the National Government</h3>
<p>Pension Canceled by the Railway Workers' Association</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: The National Government's Colonial Secretary, Thomas, was originally a railway engine cleaner. Later, he was elected as a railway workers' representative and gradually emerged in politics. Since then, he has worked hard for the railway workers. Since 1918, he has served as the Political Secretary-General of the National Railway Workers' Association and the president of the association. If he remained in office until 1935, his pension would exceed 500 pounds per year. Recently, due to supporting the Labour Party leader MacDonald, he was disliked by the Railway Workers' Association. The association's executive department sent a letter to Thomas, requesting him to leave the government and join Henderson and other Labour Party leaders in opposing the government. Thomas replied that if he complied with this request, he would be branded a coward and therefore refused. As a result, Thomas's 26-year relationship with the Railway Workers' Association was naturally severed. The association's executive department decided to cancel Thomas's pension. Today, the representatives of the Railway Workers' Association held a meeting. At the final decision, Thomas also attended the meeting to apply for understanding of his difficulties and repeatedly stated them for half an hour. The crowd still voted in favor of the executive department's decision. When the result was announced, the whole scene was silent, and Thomas was almost in tears. When Thomas delivered his speech, he sadly pointed to his old wife and children in the corner of the scene and shouted sternly: "I have worked tirelessly for the railway workers. I don't think I have done my best, but you are willing to let them suffer?"</p>
<h3>Franco-German Negotiations to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>Discussing Reparations and Short-Term Debt Issues</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 30th: After French Prime Minister Laval returns to France from the United States on Sunday, direct negotiations between France and Germany on reparations and short-term debt issues can begin. The German Ambassador to France, Dr. Hoesch, has returned to Berlin to consult with the German government on its attitude. When President Hoover's moratorium on war debts expires and when the 1.5 billion mark short-term bad debt matures on February 1st next year, Germany's financial situation will be very serious. Therefore, it is necessary to first raise emergency measures to avoid another financial panic. When the French Prime Minister conferred with President Hoover in Washington, they discussed the overall issue of the world's economic plight and agreed that there should be an international financial agreement before the end of the war debt moratorium and agreed that the most relevant European countries should take the lead in this agreement. According to official statistics released in Berlin today, German banks and industries owe a total of 23.5 billion marks, of which 12 billion marks are short-term debts due within twelve months.</p>
<h3>Britain Extends Short-Term Debt to the United States and France by Three Months</h3>
<p>Domestic Commerce Shows Lively Signs</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: The Bank of England announced that the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have agreed to extend the short-term debt tails in francs and US dollars previously lent to the Bank of England when there was a large outflow of cash from the UK by three months. The original amount of this debt was 25 million pounds each for the United States and France, but the Bank of England sold approximately 15 million pounds worth of gold bars to pay part of it. Therefore, the current debt owed to the United States and France is approximately 15 million pounds each.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st: A real recovery in British commerce seems to have begun. Most reports from commercial centers have been very exciting for several weeks. According to today's news, major industrial areas are now showing greater activity than the original scenes at the beginning of the depression, and the demand for factory sites is gradually increasing. Hundreds of workers in Glasgow who had been unemployed for months have returned to work in factories this morning because the factory has now received a foreign single order for 4,000 tons of steel axles. Other steel mills in Clyde have also received enthusiastic inquiries. Four foreign commercial firms have purchased factory sites in Birmingham, and 15 British commercial firms have issued notices of intent to purchase sites. France, Germany, and the Netherlands also have plans to purchase land in the UK. European and American commercial firms are also inquiring about whether there are suitable locations for building houses. The demand for factory sites is due to foreign fears that the UK will impose taxes on imported goods.</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Restricts the Import of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 30th: After the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark stopped using the gold standard, trade trends have changed greatly. The Netherlands now sees a large increase in imports and is very alarmed. Today, the Dutch government submitted a bill in parliament authorizing the government to prohibit the import of certain goods from any country for a certain period of time after consulting with a special expert committee. Any import of goods whose value exceeds the average import value of the past three years must be prohibited from being imported again, but exemptions may be granted in special circumstances.</p>
<h3>US Bank Failures This Year</h3>
<p>Reach 1,234</p>
<p>Deposits of 93 Million Yuan</p>
<p>De Hollandsche Bank Stops Business</p>
<p>New York News: According to the Federal Reserve Board, 298 banks failed in the United States in September, including 48 national banks, 16 state banks, and 236 non-banking association banks, with total deposits of 270 million gold yuan. Except for December of last year, when 344 banks failed, September was the month with the most bank failures. In the first nine months of this year, a total of 1,234 banks failed nationwide, with total deposits of 93 million yuan, including 211 national banks, 57 state banks, and 966 non-banking association banks. (World News Agency)</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 30th: The Federal Bank Trust Company, with assets of 18 million yuan, was ordered to cease operations today by the State Banking Supervisor.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dusseldorf, Germany, 30th: De Hollandsche Bank here closed its doors today due to difficulty in raising funds. It is reported that foreign debts of 6 million marks are involved.</p>
<h3>Spanish Presidential Election System</h3>
<p>Socialist Party Amendment Passed by Congress</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 31st: The Spanish Parliament has passed the Socialist Party's amended presidential election system, opening another new example of world elections of presidents. In the future, when Spain elects a president, voters will elect an initial selection of people equal in number to members of Congress.

This Socialist Party amendment was passed by a vote of 151 to 130.</p>
<h3>Edison's Estate in Dispute</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Wilmington, 30th: After the death of the inventor genius Edison, his will stipulated that the assets of Edison Company, worth approximately 14 million US dollars, would be given to the son of his second wife, and only the residence would be turned into a fund to collect interest and distributed to the six children born to his first and second wives. Now, William, the son of the first wife, claims that he will fight in court, pointing out that the final drafting of the will was after his father fell ill and was actually due to the improper instigation of his stepmother, which was not his father's original intention. The will was submitted to the Newark Court for identification yesterday. The people in the Edison family did not want to express anything about William's statement of protest. It is expected that after William actually carries out the protest, the case will not be judged in a short time.</p>
<h3>The Inventor of the Tank, Gobel, Dies in Poverty</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th: German manufacturer Wilhelm Gobel, who claimed to have invented the tank during the European War, died in a public hospital in Berlin today at the age of 67. Gobel was originally wealthy and began researching armored vehicles before the European War, spending a lot of his family wealth. He finally died in poverty. In recent years, Gobel lived in a small house, relying only on a small pension to spend his remaining years. Whenever well-wishers visited, he would eloquently describe the process of his tank invention, but people did not praise him slightly. Recently, the number of visitors has been very few. When he died, no one was by his side. The situation was very tragic. Whether the tank was invented by Gobel has not yet been proven or denied. Before the European War, Gobel built a vehicle shaped like an inchworm, which did not require human power to drive, but was driven by radio. This vehicle was tested by the military authorities in Dengberghoff, and the results were not good. However, Gobel finally received funding from the government to continue his research. Gobel claimed to have made great contributions to the government, but the details are difficult to understand, and it is truly unfortunate that he died in poverty in his old age.</p>
<h3>London Silver Market Continues to Rise in Near and Far Terms</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 31st: The London silver market closed higher again today. The spot price was 18 pence 1875, up 375 from yesterday's 17 pence 8125, and the forward price was 18 pence 125, up 3125 from yesterday's 17 pence 8125.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Xinghua Telegram: Addressed to all newspapers, major philanthropists, charitable organizations, and groups: Everyone knows that Xinghua is the most severely affected by the Jiangbei floods. However, even those who have personally experienced the tragic situation find it difficult to describe one ten-thousandth of it. When Liu Zhuyan came to Xinghua to handle relief, he was shocked beyond words when he first saw the devastation inside and outside the city. Later, when he went to the countryside for investigation and visited various remote villages, he realized that the suffering in the rural areas was ten thousand times greater than in the city. What he saw along the way was mostly just the roofs and treetops exposed above the water. Countless houses were completely destroyed, with not a single tile remaining. The dead were hanging corpses from treetops, and the living were displaced and homeless. Women, children, the elderly, and the weak were unable to move and intended to climb onto the sloping and unfallen roofs and broken embankments to eke out a living. They were all hungry, emaciated, waiting to be fed, shivering in thin clothes, and were about to freeze to death. Xinghua, with an area of 7,000 square miles, has been flooded for nearly three months. The entire territory is still submerged, like a vast sea. Whenever storms rage, raging waves surge, overturning boats and collapsing houses are heard from time to time. Cries for help and the sound of wild crying are the same. Liu Zhuyan witnessed the tragic situation and was heartbroken. He urgently sought to provide relief, but our relief supplies are limited, and our hearts are willing but our strength is insufficient. In addition to feeling ashamed, we especially send telegrams on behalf of the victims in the entire county of Xinghua, hoping that major philanthropists, charitable organizations, and groups will urgently raise large amounts of relief funds to be distributed in Xinghua, especially paying attention to remote rural villages and setting up more porridge kitchens or shelters so that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will not completely fill the ditches and fall into the path of starvation and cold ghosts. We respectfully kowtow nine times for the disaster victims in the entire county of Xinghua and await your arrival. Liu Zhuyan, Special Commissioner of the Xinghua Investigation and Relief of the Jiangbei Flood Temporary Charity Association, kowtows.</p>

<h3>Record of the Manchurian Incident Investigation (Wang Keyi)</h3>
<p>Circumstances of the Japanese Army's Dispatch and Occupation of Various Locations</p>
<p>(A) (1) Shenyang</p>
<p>On the 18th, at 7:00 PM, the Japanese side gave Zang Shiyi five minutes to resolve the Nakamura incident. Zang requested ten minutes for consideration, but the Japanese side refused. They then blew up the South Manchurian Railway bridge near Beida Camp themselves, falsely claiming it was done by our troops. Using this as a pretext, they opened fire on Beida Camp at 10:00 PM, firing every three to five minutes. The soldiers at Beida Camp immediately reported to Chief of Staff Rong Zhen for instructions. Rong instructed the soldiers not to resist in any way and to allow the Japanese army to do as they pleased. At the same time, he contacted the Japanese Consul in Shenyang by telephone, requesting that he stop the military action. The Japanese Consul initially claimed to be unaware of the truth, then stated that it was the Kwantung Army protecting the railway and that diplomatic officials could not interfere. He said that negotiations would have to wait until the next day when Commander-in-Chief Honjo Shigeru arrived in Shenyang. The Japanese army occupied Beida Camp at 12:00 AM and simultaneously moved into the city.</p>
<p>On the 19th, at 2:00 AM, they occupied the industrial area, the commercial district, and the mortar factory. At 7:00 AM, they occupied all the public security bureaus and police stations in the city. Police officers and staff who were unable to escape were killed.

City telephone, long-distance telephone, and wired telegraph lines were cut off. All wireless radio stations were occupied, and communication was completely severed. They seized post office trucks to transport military supplies. The railway tracks between the Beining Line's main station and Huanggu Tun were dismantled at the Third Hole Overseas Chinese residence. The Beining train only went as far as Huanggu Tun, and the Shenhai line was suspended. The road police and armed forces on both lines were disarmed. The South Manchurian Railway refused to transport Chinese people. Beida Camp was burned, and the fire was not extinguished until 6:00 PM. Honjo Shigeru and Lieutenant General Tamon issued separate proclamations to reassure the people, falsely claiming that our side had bombed their railway bridge and provoked them, so they dispatched troops to punish the Liaoning Army. Criminals and disloyal Koreans engaged in rampant looting. Many important families flew foreign flags to protect themselves. The city residents were extremely panicked, and businesses closed their doors and went on strike. Important figures were either detained or monitored. Those who were free disguised themselves and fled westward. The aircraft factories were all occupied, and all guns, cannons, and ammunition were transported away. More than forty aircraft were repainted in Japanese style for their use. All banks were occupied, and the current funds of the Frontier Bank and the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces were also moved away. All schools were closed.</p>

The Public Security Bureau was forced to surrender its weapons. At 10:30 PM, they occupied the wireless telegraph office. The Jilin gunpowder branch factory in Nanling had already been blown up by the Japanese army at 5:30 PM.</p>

The military headquarters sent personnel to receive them. It was not until midnight that the Japanese army began to deploy throughout the city.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, the Jichang and Jidun lines were operating as usual, while the Jihai line remained suspended.</p>
<p>(4) Other Locations</p>
<p>Yingkou, Andong, and all locations along the South Manchurian Railway, the Sitao Railway, and all locations along the Sitao Railway were successively captured by the Japanese army. The local military and police forces were all disarmed. Communication organs were either monitored or occupied. In most cities and counties, the political system remained the same as before.</p>
<h3>Situation in Various Locations After the Incident</h3>
<p>(B) (1) Shenyang</p>
<p>On the 19th, at noon, Honjo Shigeru arrived in Shenyang. Our authorities requested to negotiate with him, but the Japanese side stated that negotiations could only begin after the military conference was over. After the conference ended at 6:00 PM, they stated that our military and political authorities were not qualified to negotiate, but that representatives of the people could meet and discuss. The Japanese Consul relayed to Zang that the Japanese side agreed to restore the number of police officers in Shenyang to 600. On the 20th, Honjo Shigeru appointed Doihara Kenji as the mayor of Fengtian (Shenyang) and began to organize the Municipal Government Office, dividing it into five sections: General Affairs, Finance, Police Affairs, Civil Engineering, and Health. The heads of each section, as well as the secretaries and advisors, were all Japanese. Li Yi began to organize a self-defense police bureau.

<h3>The Japanese Army in Jilin is Increasingly Brutal and Unruly</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that a person from Jilin said that when the Japanese army first arrived in Jilin, they still knew to wear a mask and suppress their violent nature. After occupying the city for a long time, they became increasingly brutal and unruly. Every night, a curfew was imposed, and after 6:00 PM, people were not allowed to walk on the streets. Residents who returned home slightly late were shot by the Japanese army. The number of people who were beaten and humiliated was countless. The Japanese army searched house by house for military equipment, and if they found cash and valuables, they would simply take them away. Moreover, their searches often took place at 3:00 or 4:00 AM. When they arrived at a house, they forced the residents to stand naked outside in the cold, which was especially difficult in the snowy weather. Therefore, residents who were able to move out have already done so, and many houses are empty. The Japanese army dug trenches and set up artillery positions outside the city. They also repaired the Chinese barracks and resided in them. They also opened an airfield with an area of 400 mu. However, when the American officials went to Jilin to investigate, the airfield was temporarily stopped. The guard posts at each city gate were removed, and it was ordered that all government offices display the Blue Sky White Sun flag, even though the Blue Sky White Sun flag had not been displayed for several weeks. After the American officials left, things returned to the way they were before, which the investigators could not know. As for Xi Qia's puppet government, all those with a little knowledge and integrity avoided it. Li Xien, the vice-president of Jilin University, initially reluctantly became the director of education because Xi threatened the safety of the university and its students. His appointment was three days later than that of other directors. Recently, Li also took the opportunity to escape to Harbin. Xi, seeing that the people's hearts were not with him, was quite fearful and repeatedly sent people to Beiping to see Zhang Zuoxiang, seeking forgiveness. In addition, Li Derun, a former member of the Jilin Provincial Assembly, went to Beiping and vehemently denied that he was Xi Qia's representative, but he stated that in view of the fact that Zhang Zuoxiang's old subordinates Feng Zhanhai, Zhang Zuozhou, and other troops, as well as Xi's troops, were harassing the vicinity of Jilin and levying donations on the spot, at a rate of one thousand diao (approximately three yuan in national currency) per hectare of land, he feared that they would mutiny, and he also feared that the Japanese army would withdraw, and that Feng and Zhang would retaliate against Xi, and that the common people would suffer innocently. Therefore, he went to Beiping to see Zhang Zuoxiang, asking him to find a way to pay the Zhang and Feng troops and to prevent extortion, prevent mutiny and counterattacks, and so on. His words were like this, and his intentions can be seen. Since Xi is still doubtful about independence, the Japanese will surely come up with other schemes. The people of the country should be strictly on guard and prevent them in advance.</p>
<h3>After Zhao Xinbo Takes Office as the Puppet Mayor of Shenyang</h3>
<p>The Two Han Dynasties were Warlike, and Zhao Claims Illness and Refuses to Appear</p>
<p>Kan Chaoxi Expresses Negativity Due to Zhao's Seniority</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Colludes with Bandits to Disturb Various Places</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin states that Zhao Xinbo took office as the mayor of Shenyang on October 20th. On that day, businesses in Shenyang were forced to hang flags to congratulate him. The chairman of the local maintenance committee, Yuan Jinkai, personally delivered a speech. The ceremony was grand, and it had the appearance of establishing a government. On that day, the maintenance committee also issued a proclamation stating, "Since the incident occurred in the provincial capital, the organs have been desolate, and the municipal administration has been suspended. Since the military department dispatched Mayor Doihara to take over, the scope has been expanded and the regulations have been elevated, which conforms to the original intention of establishing a city. After recent consultations, it was agreed to hand over and take over self-management. I believe that our merchants and people will be pleased to hear of this. Now, this committee entrusts Zhao Xinbo as the mayor of the municipal government. The power of the office is attributed to him, and the responsibility is extremely heavy. We hope that the municipal administration will be enlightened, and that all neglected matters will be revived. The future will be improved, and the affairs will be prosperous, so the merchants and people will rely on it. This is a special announcement." Commander of the Kwantung Army Honjo and former Mayor Doihara each gave a speech. Zhao Xinbo listened respectfully and obeyed the order. Thus, the so-called handover of the city administration to the Chinese, which was nominally but not actually true, began on that day. However, with the exception of the directors of the civil engineering and finance departments, who withdrew, the remaining police and education departments were still handled by the Japanese in accordance with the previously agreed-upon terms. Therefore, Zhao, as the mayor, had to ask for instructions from the Japanese directors in everything. However, outsiders did not sympathize with Zhao. Since Zhao was also the mayor, he was responsible for the entire province of Shenyang. Feng Jingyi, the head of the self-defense police bureau, was most dissatisfied with Zhao. The day after Zhao took office, he suddenly demanded 50,000 yuan from Zhao, saying that it was to pay wages, otherwise the 2,000 police officers would have an accident, and he would not be responsible. Feng's pro-Japanese stance was no less than Zhao's. He was also a red person in front of Honjo. Feng had been a senior criminal investigator in the Japanese police署 for many years, and he had long had a relationship with the Japanese side. Zhao did not dare to offend him and tried his best to raise money, but he only got 20,000 yuan, which he handed over to Feng. Feng did not accept it and insisted on 50,000 yuan. Zhao had no choice but to sue Honjo and threatened to resign. Honjo only wanted to use these treacherous people and did not want Feng to force him too much, so he ordered Feng to be reprimanded, and Zhao was given some face. The battle between the two men came to an end. Yuan Jinkai, in order to curry favor with Zhao, specially suggested to Honjo that the local maintenance committee increase three members, one being Zhao Xinbo, and the other two being Gao Yuheng, the newly appointed director of finance, and Weng Enyu, the director of industry. As a result, Zhao's power increased, and he was the most authoritative person among the Chinese, apart from the Japanese commander. However, Zhao was unhappy because of Feng Jingyi's opposition, and he claimed illness and did not appear after the 24th. The affairs of the municipal government were handled by the secretary-general on his behalf. At the same time, the maintenance committee was divided into several factions after Zhao joined. Yuan Jinkai's son, Chonghan, belonged to the bat faction, which was smooth in everything and did not express a definite opinion. Kan Chaoxi was also unhappy because Zhao Xinbo had come from behind. He contacted Jian Xiu, Li Youlan, Tong Zhaoyuan, and others to oppose Zhao. Zhao, in order to counter this, also wooed Jin Liang and Sun Zuchang to consolidate his power. Moreover, because he had the support of the commander of the Kwantung Army behind him, Kan's faction was no match. Recently, Kan expressed his negativity because he was frustrated and said that he would resign. If Kan, as the vice-chairman, resigned, then Zhao Xinbo would be promoted to a higher position. Outsiders in Shenyang, seeing these people fighting each other, did not know shame and found it very strange. In order to achieve its long-term occupation of the Northeast, the Japanese, because it was not easy to realize a restoration and an independent political system for a while, not only contacted these people, but also colluded with bandits, providing them with guns and ammunition, so that they could disrupt various places. They used the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to permanently station troops and could also advance into the interior. At present, bandits are rising up everywhere, such as in Taian, Liaoning Province, which has already been broken through by bandits, and in Panshi, Jilin Province, where the so-called autonomous army has emerged, all of which are the result of Japanese instigation. The Japanese side is creating all kinds of news of unrest in the localities to scare the people of the Northeast and also to attract the attention of the world. For example, the bandits in Qingshi are only a few hundred people, and the bandit leader Yang Jia Yin, also known as Ling Yinqingyuan, was a remnant of the Jilin autonomous army in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. The Japanese side has expanded its propaganda, claiming that there are tens of thousands of people and that they have been plotting against Zhang Xueliang for twenty years. In fact, the people of the Northeast have never heard of Ling Yinqing, nor have they heard of the movement to oppose Zhang for twenty years. This is indeed a blatant fabrication of the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese are also using Koreans to convene a general meeting of all Korean overseas Chinese in Shenyang. The meeting was held on the 22nd of this month, and 140 Korean overseas Chinese representatives attended. The agenda included the absurd proposal to implement commercial lease rights and to clean up reclamation. This is also a method used by the Japanese to create an atmosphere to intimidate all parties. In the counties and cities along the South Manchurian Railway, after the Japanese forcibly changed the system, and because it was difficult to speak to the outside world, they pulled out Ma Longtan, the chairman of the Red Swastika Society and the former director of the Sitao Railway, to organize a joint autonomy of the five counties of Changtu. Ma was seventy-one years old and even more昏悖 than Zhang HaiPeng in Taonan. This time, he was used by the Japanese and disregarded the interests of the country. He was truly what is meant by "old and not dead." The so-called declaration of autonomy is appended below: "For the declaration, according to the humble Ma Longtan, since the Sino-Japanese incident occurred, the Northeast government has been destroyed and no longer exists, the military police are scattered, rumors are rife, and bandits are rampant. The people have lost their wealth and homes and are suffering in chaos. The miserable situation is unbearable to see. Now, thanks to the cooperation and agreement of the gentry and people of Changtu, Lishu, Liaoyuan, Huade, and Kaiyuan counties, the Sino-Manchu Joint Independent Autonomous Association has been established, and all political organs have been newly established. The humble is entrusted by Heaven and responds to the hopes of the people, based on the great mission of the Red Swastika Society and in accordance with the highest purpose of love and goodness of mankind in the world, to build a paradise of Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, the Sino-Manchu Joint Independent Autonomous Association is declared, and it is hoped that the gentry and people will not play with it, but swear to cooperate. The President of the Sino-Manchu Joint Independent Autonomous Association, Ma Longtan, October 15th, 20th year of the Republic of China." The absurdity of it can be imagined. (27th)</p>
<h3>Jiang Bocheng's Talk on the Situation in Jinan</h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief is Determined Not to Step Down</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session will be Held as Scheduled</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Jiang Bocheng, the chief counselor of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Rectification Committee, was summoned to Beijing for consultation. Today (29th), at 6:10 PM, he returned to Jinan by the Pingpu train. Xiang Jieren, the former director of the Shandong Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, came with him. Li Zongbi, the chief of staff of the General Headquarters, Zhang Shaotang, the secretary-general of the provincial government, Wen Chenglie, the mayor of Jinan, and others welcomed him at the station. After Jiang got off the train, he greeted the welcomers and exchanged greetings. According to Jiang's interview with reporters, the Shanghai peace conference has not made any progress because the central government intends to first invite the people from Guangdong to Beijing to unite and face the outside world without discussing conditions, while the people from Guangdong insist on discussing conditions first and then entering Beijing, so it has not been resolved yet. Commander-in-Chief Jiang is determined not to step down and take responsibility to the end. Commander-in-Chief has stated that he may step down and rest in ordinary times, but at this time of national crisis, he will never be afraid of difficulties and step down, hoping to shirk responsibility and be laughed at by the world. As for whether the Guangdong government will withdraw the telegram, it is up to the Guangdong government to decide, and the central government will not interfere. The Fourth Plenary Session will be held as scheduled and will not be postponed. The military pay issue will still be the responsibility of Minister Song to raise funds. Rumors that Minister Song has resigned are absolutely not true. Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places are now very peaceful. (October 29th)</p>
<h3>He Xiangning's Statement on Japan</h3>
<p>Tell the Soldiers of the Whole Country Not to Sacrifice Themselves for Internal Warfare</p>
<p>To the Soldiers and People of the Whole Country, through the Shanghai Shenbao: Since the Japanese imperialists occupied our northeastern territories, disastrous news has been spreading, filling hearts with grief and anger. We have heard that our people and soldiers have been brutally massacred by the Japanese invaders, and blood is everywhere. Since our Chinese nation has had its own history, there has never been a greater shame and humiliation than this. However, since this tragic event occurred, again and again, rising up to resist the Japanese imperialists and willing to fight to the death have only been our patriotic young soldiers and people. But the soldiers and politicians who wield weapons of murder, who are said to have the responsibility of defending the territory, are silent and dare not make a sound. Their usual courage to flaunt their power and seize territory has disappeared at this time when they should be fighting. Moreover, at present, natural disasters and floods are sweeping the country, corpses are everywhere, and the people are struggling to survive. They have no time to help the living and save the dying, and they are still willing to fight each other and engage in fratricide. If they have any blood and conscience, can they not be ashamed to die? The freedom and equality of our nation, which our Founding Father Sun devoted his life to seeking, can only be achieved by overthrowing imperialism. This has been completely abandoned by these people, and in the end, they have fallen into the tragic disaster of losing their country and people today. However, at this critical moment for the survival of the country, our soldiers and people want to seek life in death and survive in destruction. Apart from everyone's unanimous and thorough awakening and uniting with the small and weak nations of the world, and jointly struggling, using the blue blood of 400 million people to sprinkle on the Japanese imperialists in exchange for it, we cannot find a way out. It is especially important for our soldiers throughout the country to realize that the country's military equipment is intended to protect the country's territory and people, not to be a tool for private individuals to seize territory and rights. The blue blood of our soldiers should be poured on the imperialists who insult and kill us, so as to create the glory of our Chinese nation in the world. It should not be used to kill our own compatriots, leave disaster to our own people, and be sacrificed for private individuals in internal warfare. The blue blood of our people, sprinkled on the imperialists, can create our tragic and patriotic soul even in death. Being sacrificed for private individuals, the result is not even as good as a hunting dog. Moreover, for thousands of years to come, the stain of our soldiers who harm the country and the people will be cursed by people and cannot be washed away. What choice will our hundreds of thousands of patriotic soldiers throughout the country make? If the internal war continues like this, the disaster of national destruction will surely follow. After this letter arrives, if all our people rise up and declare war on Japan, then Xiangning, although she is old and sick and cannot run to the border, will surely return to the country immediately and swear to follow the people to carry out the work of rescuing the dead and wounded, so as to deliver the final death blow to the Japanese imperialists. He Xiangning, sent from Paris on October 3rd.</p>
<h3>He Jian Strongly Advocates Declaring War on Japan</h3>
<p>Speaking on the Japanese Issue in the Provincial Government for Several Days</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that after the Japanese invaded and occupied Liaoning, the whole country was filled with indignation. He Jian, the chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, was also extremely indignant and telegraphed the central government, requesting that a declaration of war be made on Japan. Hunan Province is prepared to send 300,000 troops to contend with the brutal Japanese. At the same time, he issued an order to all of his troops and civil servants to prohibit the purchase of Japanese goods and to intensify military training in preparation for resisting Japan and saving the country. As a result, all sectors have established national salvation and anti-Japanese organizations, and an anti-Japanese atmosphere permeates the entire province of Hunan. For several days, He Jian has also convened people from all sectors of the party, government, and military in the auditorium of the provincial government to give lectures on the Japanese issue in order to expand anti-Japanese propaganda. As of yesterday, he has given five lectures, and the general outline of each lecture is excerpted below. The first lecture was entitled "The Future of Japanese Violence and the Awareness that the People of the Country Should Have." The general idea was to describe the immaturity of past anti-Japanese actions, to criticize the miscalculation of 20 years of internal strife, and to state that the only thing that the powers rely on to maintain peace in East Asia is the balance of power. Now that the brutal Japanese have invaded our Liaoning, breaking the balance of power, the powers will inevitably come out and intervene, especially the possibility of a break between Russia and Japan and between the United States and Japan at any time. The Japanese have been isolated internationally. If the people of the country want to survive, they can take advantage of this opportunity to fight. The second lecture was entitled "Analysis of the Japanese Disaster and the Advantages and Disadvantages of Declaring War on Japan." The first part described the reasons why the Japanese invasion of China was difficult to avoid, which were analyzed into six items: (1) The Japanese population and food problem. The domestic food production in Japan is not abundant, and the population is expanding day by day, so it has to invade China. (2) The Japanese industrial raw materials problem. It is bound to invade Manchuria and Mongolia in order to maintain its life. (3) The Japanese capital problem. Because Tokyo is often subject to earthquakes, it always wants to occupy Manchuria and Mongolia as a shield for Korea, and it is convenient to build its capital in Korea. (4) The Japanese national defense problem. It believes that by stationing troops in Manchuria and Mongolia, it can prevent internal rebellion and prevent maritime blockade from the outside. (5) Japan's recent internal and foreign policy issues. The domestic party struggle is extremely fierce. General warlords want to annex Manchuria and Mongolia in order to win over the people and monopolize the power of reform. Externally, they are preparing to seize Manchuria and Mongolia and then ally with the European War and the United States. (6) The history of Japan's plot to seize Manchuria and Mongolia. Looking at the Tanaka Memorial, its plan to seize Manchuria and Mongolia is not a matter of one day or one night, and it is difficult to avoid. The second part describes that since the Japanese disaster cannot be avoided and the League of Nations cannot be fully relied on, relying solely on economic sanctions will not immediately restore the lost land. The only way is to fight. Finally, it is explained that (1) internal strife cannot be stopped without war, (2) the people cannot be awakened without war, and (3) there is no way to survive without war. The third lecture was entitled "Japan's Conspiracies Throughout History." The details of the Japanese's repeated conspiracies to invade China and the so-called continental policy were described in great detail. The final conclusion was that it is always inevitable sooner or later, and the way for the people of the country to deal with it is to declare war. The fourth lecture was entitled "There is a Full Chance of Winning the Declaration of War on Japan." The general idea has four points (1) Economic problem. If our country declares war on Japan, and we are united from top to bottom, Japan's economy will definitely be unable to support it within two years. This is the first reason why I have a full chance of winning. (2) Party problem. If our country declares war on Japan, and we are united from top to bottom, Japan's parties will inevitably compete with each other. This is the second reason why I have a full chance of winning. (3) Colonial problem. If our country declares war on Japan, and we are united from top to bottom, the Korean people's restoration movement will inevitably rise up. This is the third reason why I have a full chance of winning. (4) International problem. If our country declares war on Japan, and we are united from top to bottom, Japan will be isolated and helpless. This is the fourth reason why I have a full chance of winning. The fifth lecture was entitled "Matters to be Noted by the People of the Country in Resisting Japan and Saving the Country," which are divided into five items: (1) Strict precautions must be taken against bandits who take the opportunity to run rampant. (2) Order must be strictly observed to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. (3) Diligent work must be done to enrich the strength of resisting Japan. (4) Thrift must be strictly enforced and economic sanctions must be carried out effectively. (5) Military training must be intensified. (October 28th)</p>

<h3>Liu Guitang's Troops Defeated in Attack on Anqiu</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Orders All Divisions to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang, a major bandit from southern Shandong, has been rampant between Lin, Ju, Ri, and Zhu after his troops occupied Rizhao. The 81st Division's Zhan Shutang troops pursued them for more than a month without being able to wipe them out. The other day, they suddenly fled from Mount Wulian to Jingqiu, on the border of Anqiu. Today (the 28th), the Provincial Government received a telegram from Qiu Guorui, the county magistrate of Anqiu, reporting that Liu's bandits had sent people to the city to convey a message, stating that they wanted to station themselves in Anqiu and await recruitment, requesting that the city be opened to welcome the main force into the city. If the city was closed and defended, they would attack the city, and after the city was broken, everything would be destroyed. In addition to ordering the police team to join the militia to defend the city, the county magistrate requested instructions. Upon receiving this, Chairman Han Fuqu immediately telegraphed the Zhang Shulin troops of the 58th Brigade stationed in Weixian to send two battalions and the Zhang Qingxiu regiment of the Ma Jingong troops of the 60th Brigade stationed in Gaomi to send one battalion to advance to Anqiu for support. At the same time, armored vehicles were ordered to drive to Weixian to prevent Liu's troops from destroying the Jiaoji Railway, about fifty miles from Anqiu Railway Station near Fangzi, and to provide support. It is said that Liu's bandits have already besieged Anqiu. The city of Anqiu is as big as a dipper, and the militia and Lian Zhuang Hui are corrupt and incompetent, which is very worrying. Chairman Han Fuqu said that Liu's bandits only number a few hundred, and their purpose seems to be to flee to Liushanzhai in Linqu to unite with other gangs. He has ordered the troops stationed in Qingzhou to rush to intercept and encircle them, and strive to annihilate them. As for Liu Guitang's claim to await recruitment, it is absolutely untrue, because there is still no source for the current formal army salaries, how can we recruit bandits again and burden the people.</p>
<p>The order dispatched the Tang Bangzhi brigade stationed in Linhe, the entire Yun Qichang brigade in Juxian, and the entire Liu Weili regiment in Rizhao to advance at full speed to encircle and suppress Liu's bandits. However, Jingqiu is 180 li from Juxian, more than 200 li from Rizhao, and 360 li from Linhe. It is feared that before the Zhan division arrives, Liu will flee elsewhere. It is also heard that bandits in Linqu and Anqiu, such as Tong Piezai, Huo Mingzhu, and Wang Ziming, each with more than 200 people, have already joined forces with Liu's troops. The villages of Cuijiayu, Hujiawang, Dagouya, Caojiayu, Dagongguan, and Xiaogongguan in Anqiu have all been burned by these bandits. The village of Dagouya has even been massacred, with more than twenty people from several families, only a one-month-old child surviving, which is extremely cruel. The Chen battalion of the Fu Mizeng regiment of the 220th Brigade of the 74th Division stationed in Anqiu immediately rushed to pursue them, but because the local police team, militia, and Lian Zhuang Hui failed to cooperate effectively, the bandits escaped. Later, due to the strict urging to suppress the bandits by the General Command of the Qingxiang Supervisory Office of the Provincial Reserve, Governor Qiu Guorui personally supervised the suppression and strictly ordered the militia and Lian Zhuang Hui to take the lead, killing one bandit, and the remaining bandits collapsed and retreated. It is found that Anqiu was originally a bandit-free area, but in the past year, the stationed troops, police team, militia, and Lian Zhuang Hui have been sitting idle and eating salaries without thinking about suppressing bandits, causing the bandits to grow stronger. If Liu Guitang's troops were to flee again, the bandit disasters in Anqiu, Juxian, Linqu, and other counties would become increasingly rampant (28th).</p>
<p>Another message: Liu Guitang's troops suddenly fled from Mount Wulian to Anqiu on the 27th and besieged the county seat. Fortunately, the Fu regiment arrived yesterday and attacked the bandits, who then fled to the area around Liushan Plain in Xiapo, forty li from the city. According to a telegram received by the Provincial Government from Qiu Guorui, the county magistrate of Anqiu, on the 28th, the Fu regiment advanced from Anqiu to attack the bandits. Zhang Shulin, the brigade commander of the 58th Brigade sent by Chairman Han, had already led a regiment of soldiers to arrive and attack. Today (29th), Chairman Han again ordered Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, to order a regiment of the Ma Jingong troops of the 60th Brigade stationed in Qingzhou to meet in Anqiu to suppress the bandits, in order to annihilate the bandit crowd.

<h3>Yangtze River Waterway Commission Surveys Damaged Dikes in Flood-Stricken Areas Along the River</h3>
<p>Organizing Three Survey Teams</p>
<p>Deadline for Completion in One Month</p>
<p>This year's floods along the Yangtze River were extraordinarily severe, and critical dikes were breached. Yu Feipeng, chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Commission of the Ministry of Communications, believes that the breached dikes along the river urgently need a thorough survey to prepare for timely repairs in winter and spring, as a plan to prevent disasters in the future. The National Government Relief Commission for Flood Disasters has also sent repeated letters and telegrams requesting surveys of the damaged dikes along the Yangtze River. The commission decided at a regular meeting to temporarily suspend the original downstream surveying work and ordered Song Xishang, director of the engineering department, and Ye Jiyuan, director of the general affairs department, to draft the organizational law of the dike surveying team in the disaster area and report it for approval. Now, internal and external technical personnel have been transferred and dispatched to the disaster areas on October 17 to conduct surveys. The details are as follows: A. Survey Scope: The dikes along the Yangtze River, from Zhenjiang to Shashi. The commission initially planned to divide the survey into five teams for full surveying. Due to time constraints and to expedite the completion of the work, the section from Shashi to Wuxue will be surveyed by the Relief Commission for Flood Disasters in consultation with the Hubei Provincial Government. The current survey scope of the commission will be from Zhenjiang to Wuxue, divided into three sections: Zhenjiang-Wuhu, Wuhu-Anqing, and Qizhou-Wuxue. The deadline is one month for the simultaneous completion of the surveying on both the north and south banks of the three major sections, to prepare for drafting a repair plan. B. Team Arrangement: The Zhenjiang-Wuhu section is the first team, led by Gu Ding, with deputy engineers Ke Tingzhong and Li Jiang, and assistant engineers Lv Zuoxian and Luo Zhen. The Wuhu-Anqing section is the second team, led by Wang Ruilin, with deputy engineers Yang Shidong and Zhang Hongchang, and assistant engineers Wang Hao, He Shiqi, and Feng Bingxiang. The Qizhou-Wuxue section is the third team, led by Lin Youlong, with deputy engineers Zhang Tianduo and Huang Daorong, and assistant engineers Lu Xiyu and Zhao Chenghan. The Engineering Department will draft various survey forms, indicating all separate tasks. C. Working Method: The surveying work is important and complex. The most important aspect is the cross-sectional measurement of the dikes. It is reported that measurements are taken every 100 or 200 meters. The number of measurements must be increased when the shape of the dike changes. The dike feet on both sides must be measured to more than 200 meters. The riverbank of the concave dike should be measured 50 or 100 meters beyond the waterline, so that a repair project plan can be drafted based on various actual measurement records in the future. After this surveying project is completed, construction will be prepared within the year. All budgets have been carefully drafted by the Engineering Department and submitted for approval and forwarded to the National Government Relief Commission for Flood Disasters for reference and record.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express News</h3>
<p>Li Songshan, commander of the 57th Division, came to Wuhu from Anqing the other day. Yesterday, he gathered the troops of the 171st Brigade stationed in Wuhu and the artillery battalion, reviewed them at the public sports field, and gave a speech, hoping that they would intensify training and prepare to serve the country. This afternoon, Li took a boat back to Anqing.</p>
<p>Zhang Gongheng, special commissioner for disaster relief in Anhui of the National Government Flood Relief Association, came to Wuhu from Anqing yesterday and set up an office for the disaster relief work team at the Bank of China, actively preparing for labor-based relief matters. However, the Wuhu territory needs about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan for dike repair and labor-based relief, and the current relief funds from the five county associations are only 100,000 yuan, which is far from enough. Moreover, Wuhu should have received 3,000 dan of disaster relief flour, Xuan Cheng 2,700 dan, and Dangtu 2,500 dan, but none of them have been received. Therefore, Zhang went to Shanghai today to urge the shipment. Also, as the weather is getting colder, the scout troops of various schools have formed 24 large teams to separately raise winter clothes, and plan to hold an exhibition of winter clothes for disaster victims after the collection is over.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army of various secondary schools in the city has made considerable progress in training. Now, the schools have jointly formed the Anti-Japanese Federation and requested the central government to allocate guns to implement shooting drills. Although the All-Circles Volunteer Army Committee organized by the Party Headquarters has held many meetings, it has not yet been organized and trained. The County Chamber of Commerce is also preparing to establish a business community volunteer army.</p>
<p>Bandits from Mount Wuhua in Fanchang have recently fled in small groups to the four rural areas of Wuhu to commit robberies. Yesterday, the county government's garrison team captured six people, including carpenter Ye Laixi, in Shichun Town, and intercepted several Mauser rifles. They were taken to Wuhu and executed by shooting outside the East Gate. (28th)</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory Self-Spins Fine Yarn. The Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Finishing Factory in Wuxi is the first Chinese-run cotton weaving factory with bleaching, dyeing, and finishing. In recent years, its output has increased, and its content has gradually expanded. Cheng Jingtang, the manager of the factory, purchased more than ten acres of land next to the factory to build a yarn factory building to promote self-spinning raw materials. He decided to self-spin fine yarn and purchased 16,000 spinning spindles from the Shanghai Jisheng Yarn Factory last winter to spin 14, 16, 23, 32, and 40 count yarns. They were shipped to Wuxi earlier this summer. The buildings have now been completed, and the machines are being installed. The textile experts who have been hired have already arrived in Wuxi to take office and are scheduled to close work within the year.</p>
<p>The Flower Picking Room of the Zhenxin Yarn Factory Was Burned Down. At 6:30 PM the other night, while the female workers were working in the flower picking room of the Zhenxin Yarn Factory opposite Taibao Dun outside the West Gate, a fire suddenly broke out, burning the flower clothes. For a time, the fire was raging, and the female workers screamed for help and rushed out. After various fire brigades rushed to rescue, the fire was extinguished. It is estimated that five floors and more than 100 bales of flower clothes were burned, with a loss of more than 10,000 yuan. An old female worker named Fan Chen, 65 years old, suffered severe burns to her limbs and could not speak. She has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The Xicheng Highway Opens Today. The northern section of the Xicheng Highway project has been under construction for three months. Due to the rugged road surface, it has not been opened to traffic. Now, the Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus Company and the Chengjiang Construction Bureau have jointly hired workers to repair and lay brick stones and coal dust. The entire project has now been completed and is approved to start selling tickets and open to traffic today (1st). The entire Xicheng Highway is now fully completed.</p>

Leader Xue ordered detectives such as Dai Shouquan to go to the address to arrest them. As expected, Feng and Sun were captured and confessed to the above-mentioned robberies. They also said that there was an accomplice, Lu A'da, who opened the Ruichang Congee Shop at the intersection of the Xicheng Road. Detective Dai led the detectives to arrest Lu, and a lot of stolen goods were found on his body. They were all taken to the team yesterday (31st) and presented to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Military, Police, and Political Meeting on City Defense. Since the robbery of the Bank of China in the city, rumors have been spreading and people's hearts have been disturbed. Representatives from military, police, and political agencies held an emergency meeting on city defense at the county government at 2:00 PM on the 30th. They discussed and resolved to implement measures such as dividing the area for patrols immediately.</p>
<p>The Bank of China Was Robbed by Bandits. At 11:30 AM on the 29th, six bandits wearing long gowns and carrying pistols arrived at the Bank of China on the park road south of the city. They shouted and threatened, robbing 26,710 yuan in banknotes that were being counted on the table, firing shots to show their power, and shooting and wounding the doorman Tian Youfu and the tea servant Liu Dian'an, who resisted arrest, before fleeing out. The Public Security Bureau heard the alarm and pursued them, arresting two bandits from Anhui, Zhang Fuyuan and Wang Shigui, at Yiyuan Bridge and Jiangjia Bridge, and seizing 25,105 yuan in stolen goods. They were taken to the county government for interrogation. As a result of this incident, rumors spread throughout the city, causing great confusion, and the entire city closed down. The turmoil lasted for half an hour before it subsided.</p>
<p>The County Government Executed Notorious Bandits. Tang Xiaodong, a notorious bandit from Nantong and Rugao counties, committed numerous crimes. After being captured by the County Police Team, he was handed over to the Pacification Military Law Office of the County Government for interrogation. He confessed to the crimes. With the approval of the Yangzhou Pacification Headquarters on the 29th, Zhang, the county magistrate, had Tang the bandit escorted to Yaolu intersection in the city for execution by shooting.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Huaiyang Flood Relief Committee Established: The Huaiyang Flood Relief Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM on the 30th. One hundred and twenty-four people from Jiangdu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, and the ten counties of Huai'an (Funing was absent) elected Han Zishi, Li Gongjian, Bao Zhihzi, Hu, and Ma Shijie as the five-member presidium. Han Zishi, as chairman, proposed eight motions. Dai Tianqiu proposed that the committee telegraph the provincial chairman, requesting the provincial chairman to petition. Ling Yueru proposed that representatives from each county submit petitions. Wang Yunzhi and seven others were assigned to draft the petition immediately, which was then given to Zishi to submit to the chairman. The executive committee members from each county (Jiangdu and ten other counties), totaling fifty-one people (Funing absent), were elected in the morning. They then convened a meeting of the executive committee to discuss the motions.</p>
<p>The Provincial Order: Joint Suppression of Lake Bandits by Two Counties. County Magistrate Chen Nanxuan of Jiangdu received an order from the Civil Affairs Department stating that bandits were rampant in the Tiaoyang Lake area of Jiangdu and within dozens of miles of Zhaduo, frequently committing kidnappings. It was determined that this area bordered Jiangdu, Gaoyou, and Xinghua, making it easy for bandits to flee between jurisdictions. The order instructed the counties to discuss countermeasures and allocate troops for a joint suppression. Yesterday (the 28th), a special order was issued to the Public Security Bureau's police force to conduct the suppression and the Sixth District of the Water Police was requested to send assistance.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Establishment of a Disaster Relief Association: The Jiangbei Flood Disaster Relief Association held a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on the 29th to prepare for its establishment. Ninety-two people from various counties under the jurisdiction of Huai'an and Yangzhou attended. Hu Zhen was elected chairman and reported on the circumstances of the flood disaster. The following motions were proposed: (1) to revise the association's charter; (2) to compile a history of the disaster; (3) to commemorate the civilians who died in the disaster; (4) to cast iron statues of Sun Hongzhe and others; (These thirteen cases were handed over to the executive committee for handling); (9) to erect a stone monument for the deceased compatriots; (6) to hire legal experts to appeal and prosecute; (7) to elect two executive committee members from each county, with Jiangdu, the location of the association, electing an additional three members.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Banditry on People's Postal Service Boats: The Jiaxing Shuncheng, Quansheng, Xiexing, Zhengda, Yongli, and Furun People's Postal Service, a bureau that delivers letters, operated boats that regularly traveled from Hangzhou to Shanghai, passing through Jiaxing, Jiashan, and other places, and were generally peaceful. However, at 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, as the boat arrived in He, loaded letters and goods, and sailed to Shengtangtou near Guanjia Port in the Tanghui District of Jiaxing, a bandit boat suddenly appeared. The bandits, armed with guns, ordered the boat to stop and then swarmed aboard, looting all the goods on board. The losses are estimated to be over a thousand yuan. Afterwards, the boat owner, Zhang Jisheng, returned to Tanghui to report the incident to the local Public Security Bureau, which immediately telegraphed military and police forces in various locations to assist in the arrest of the bandits.</p>
<p>Tongxiang County Magistrate Accused of Torture and Dismissed: Yang Xiuyan, the magistrate of Tongxiang County under Jiaxing's jurisdiction, was accused of using torture during interrogations. Public opinion in the county was largely critical. This time, during the interrogation of Fu Xingting, who had been falsely accused of theft, County Magistrate Yang used various cruel forms of torture after Fu was captured. Fu's family then filed a complaint with the National Government's Control Yuan, which sent investigators to Tongxiang and confirmed the allegations. The Yuan decided to dismiss Yang from his post and investigate him. The case was sent to the Executive Yuan for execution, which ordered the Zhejiang Provincial Government to comply. Furthermore, after Fu's family filed a complaint with the High Court, it designated the Jiaxing Local Branch Court as the court of jurisdiction. Yesterday, the Tongxiang County Government sent Fu Xingting to the Jiaxing Branch Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Former Tongxiang County Magistrate Tong Wei Ying Sentenced to Imprisonment: Former Tongxiang County Magistrate Zhang Weiying, during his tenure, had a disagreement with the chief of the County Public Security Bureau, Ding Huaide. He falsely reported to the province that the police in the county bureau were corrupt. The province sent a committee, along with the local defense corps, to surround the county bureau and disarm it. Chief Ding was shot and injured at the time, and much of the county bureau's property was lost. Ding then filed a complaint with the High Court, designating the Jiaxing Local Branch Court as the court of jurisdiction. The case has been heard multiple times with Zhang Weiying and other relevant individuals. Yesterday, the court announced its verdict, sentencing Zhang Weiying to six months in prison, suspended for one year, and released on bail.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Complete Suspension of Business in Three Industries: Within Huaiyin County, stores specializing in Guang goods, general merchandise, and cloth are the most numerous. It is estimated that there are no fewer than forty or fifty such stores in the entire county. Japanese goods are also most prevalent in these three industries. The Huaiyin Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, based on a resolution from its sixth executive committee meeting, sent a letter to the Huai Zhong, Huai Nong, County Normal School, and various elementary schools' Boy Scout troops on the 27th, originally planning to go into the streets today (the 28th) to seal up Japanese goods. Unexpectedly, before the Boy Scout troops and Anti-Japanese Association members had even set out, all the Guang goods, general merchandise, and cloth stores in the city had already closed their doors and completely suspended operations. Notices stating "accounts being settled, funds returned, and inconvenient to operate" were posted on the doors of each store. As a result, the Dongmen Main Street and side streets appeared desolate. Investigations revealed that the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Liu Dingxin, had gone to Yangzhou to attend a flood relief meeting, and the vice chairman, Dai Boqiu, had gone to Huai'an. In the afternoon, the county government was contacted, and County Magistrate He stated that he had not received any reports from the business community, making it difficult to ascertain the truth for the time being. According to general reports, the Japanese goods in these three industries are worth approximately five or six hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Bandits Driven Away from Zhejiang Border: Bandits led by Zhou Jianping and Shao Shiping, numbering over two thousand, in three groups attacked Kaihua and Huabu in Zhejiang. The 3rd Regiment of the Provincial Security Forces, with Chen and Wu's battalions combined, fiercely suppressed them, killing hundreds of bandits. The remaining bandits scattered and fled towards Dexing County in Jiangxi Province. Chen's battalion pursued them but was surrounded by approximately two thousand bandits. After a brave and fierce battle by the government troops for eight hours, the bandits were unable to hold out. Chen's battalion killed dozens of bandits and broke out of the encirclement. Upon receiving the report, the provincial government urgently telegraphed the National Army's Tang Brigade and the 3rd Security Regiment to intensify the suppression, aiming to completely eliminate the bandits and prevent them from harming the local area. Aerial Survey of Qiantang River Surface: Zhejiang's survey aircraft, purchased from Germany, cost over ten thousand taels of gold to install and repair. It began surveying the water surface but was taken to Jiangxi Province by the central government for use in suppressing bandits less than a month later, which has now been completed. Now, the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Bureau, due to the urgent situation of the Qingtai Gate riverbank collapse, requires an aerial survey to determine an accurate protection plan. Furthermore, the Jiang surface situation at Qiantang and Hangzhou Bay is impossible to fully assess by manual means. A special request was made to the Construction Department and an agreement was reached with the Central Land Survey Bureau to fly to Zhejiang immediately for a two-week survey to complete the previous work, costing 21,954 yuan. It is proposed to deduct the cost from the aircraft's price.</p>
<p>Six Fires at Wu Wei He Store: The Wu Wei He Tea and Food Store on Lianqiao Main Street in the city suddenly caught fire at 2:30 PM on the 30th. It was extinguished after various volunteer fire brigades arrived to put out the fire. Approximately one entrance of storage was burned, resulting in losses of over two thousand yuan. The store was originally located in the north but moved to the south after repeated fires. This is now the sixth fire it has suffered, which is truly strange.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Relief for the Sixteen Provinces Flood Disaster (Continued)</h3>
<p>5. Seed Loans: After a flood disaster, this is an important issue. Farmers lose all their seeds, and if they cannot plant in the autumn and spring, they will have no harvest. Relief efforts will inevitably be prolonged. Where can these relief funds be raised? Therefore, efforts must be made to provide seed loans. In the sixth year of the Republic, Hebei Province established forty-nine seed loan offices. However, these seeds must be collected locally or from neighboring counties and villages so they can be appropriate to the land. Northern provinces and the United States wheat seeds should not be used, as the soil may be unsuitable and make it difficult for them to grow, delaying the planting season and causing the greatest harm.</p>
<p>6. Cattle Preservation: After a flood disaster, it is difficult for farming families to preserve their cattle. Therefore, cattle preservation facilities must be established. However, it must be noted that poor-quality water and grass can cause the outbreak of epidemics, resulting in all the cattle dying from infection, defeating the purpose of preservation. Furthermore, the cost of feeding them for several months is also a significant loss. It seems better for the preservation facilities to find ways to utilize them. During this major disaster, resources should be utilized. It is permissible to use oxcarts for transportation, which can disperse the cattle and prevent them from gathering and becoming infected, while also avoiding wasting feeding costs.</p>
<p>7. Old and Infirm Shelters: After a flood disaster, houses are completely destroyed, and the old and infirm are displaced, which is pitiful. Some parents, although still alive, may abandon their children due to a lack of food, while others may have their entire families drowned, leaving only a weak survivor. These are the most helpless of humanity. Therefore, shelters should be widely established to uphold humanity and demonstrate compassion. In the sixth year of the Republic, Hebei Province established one hundred and eighty-one shelters for the old and infirm, saving the lives of tens of thousands of people. This time, the disaster area is so large that the number of shelters should be ten times greater.</p>
<p>8. Porridge Kitchens: Famine victims cannot avoid wandering, and the suffering of wandering may even lead to gatherings and riots, which greatly impacts public order. Each county should raise funds to establish porridge kitchens to provide food and make it easier for people to earn a living in their hometowns. In the sixth year of the Republic, Hebei Province established five hundred and ninety-three porridge kitchens, saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. This not only addresses the immediate emergency but also prevents wandering and dispersal. The old and infirm who cannot work and those in shelters all rely on this for assistance.</p>
<p>9. Charitable Relief: The disaster area is vast, and charitable organizations must be invited to assist in order to supplement the government's limited resources. In the sixth year of the Republic, dozens of charitable organizations from the south came to Hebei Province to provide relief, raising over one million yuan, approximately one-third of the government's relief funds. Therefore, the Directorate established a joint association of charitable organizations to discuss methods and allocate disaster areas based on the amount of relief funds. Those with insufficient funds were subsidized by the government, while those with sufficient funds were asked to take sole responsibility for a county. Before the arrival of the charitable organizations, relief personnel were sent in advance to provide train tickets, and transportation of relief supplies was negotiated for free transportation and tax-exempt passports. After their arrival, personnel were dispatched to greet them at the station, and personnel were dispatched to accompany them to various places to provide care, ensuring they were satisfied and without any difficulties. As a result, the charitable organizations enthusiastically came forward. All provinces should follow this approach this time in order to gather the collective strength. In short, the disaster area is vast, and it is impossible to rely entirely on the central and local governments' financial and human resources. As the ancient saying goes, "In a town of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people." Furthermore, "If people desire good, who is not like me?" All counties that are not affected by the disaster and all villages that are not affected by the disaster should find ways to encourage donations, either by adding donations or by individuals collecting small amounts to make a large sum. The disaster victims will truly receive the benefit, and the unaffected people will express their sympathy and mutual assistance, which will greatly impact social morality.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Chong Gong on Relief: Pre-Disaster Relief: Labor-based relief efforts such as roads and river embankments are easy to implement, only requiring funds to be established immediately. As for the fundamental issue of improving river courses, it requires long-term surveying and years of rainfall and flow records to determine plans without flaws. Moreover, this major disaster has caused the simultaneous overflow of the Yangtze, Huai, lakes, and rivers, making it difficult to solve with human and financial resources. It is proposed to implement the following regulations:</p>
<p>1. Restricting Embankment Construction: During the Qing Dynasty, there were restrictions on the construction of embankments for lake fields and sandbars, which were divided into official, civilian, and private embankments. If they obstructed waterways, local officials would conduct on-site inspections and prohibit their construction or even dismantle them, forbidding their reconstruction. Annual reports were submitted to the governors-general and governors. The regulations were very strict. However, after the decline of politics, local officials in the Republic of China regarded it as a source of profit, establishing bureaus to open up wasteland. Lake fields and sandbars increased daily, and waterways were obstructed, leading to this human disaster. Now, except for embankments that must be built for water control, the province should order each province to restrict territories according to the regulations of the former Qing Dynasty. Areas that have already collapsed should not be allowed to be rebuilt temporarily. For small farmers who rely on these lands for their livelihoods, the government can provide official land as compensation. For larger landowners, government bonds can be provided in exchange. This approach can provide several years of stability, which is better than raising large sums to repair embankments.</p>
<p>2. Dredging Ditches and Canals: The lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as the Jiangbei area, are low-lying and difficult to drain, causing water damage. However, it can also be used to develop water conservancy. For example, the Suzhou, Changzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing areas in Jiangnan have numerous rivers and streams, providing smooth irrigation and convenient transportation. It seems possible to extensively build a network of ditches and canals in the Gaoyou, Ningzhen, and Xinghua areas. This can store water in preparation for droughts and drain water to alleviate floods, transforming barren land into fertile land, comparable to Suzhou, Changzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing.</p>
<p>3. Exchanging Land: Water flows downwards, which is its natural tendency. Therefore, there must be low-lying lakes to store water and manage water flow in each river. However, if it is not addressed annually, there will inevitably be a trend of shifting south to high ground or north to high ground. When managing river works in the north in the past, it was discovered that the Daqing and Ziya Rivers relied on Dongdian Lake to store water. After the Daqing River broke into the Daqing River, Dongdian Lake gradually silted up, causing Wen'an, the lowest-lying area, to become a swamp. If there had been resolute officials at the time, they could have exchanged the high ground of Dongdian Lake with the people of Wen'an, allowing the people to avoid annual disasters and the suffering of living in low-lying, damp areas. The Daqing Rivers also had areas for storage. It is beneficial for both sides. Now, the flood in Jiangbei is caused by the silting of Hongze Lake and other lakes. If Xinghua is compared to Wen'an, and Hongze Lake is compared to Dongdian Lake, and the two are exchanged, it would save costs and provide the people with peace of mind. I have limited knowledge of the southern terrain and do not know if this approach is feasible, but I offer it for reference. At this time of severe disaster and national crisis, raising funds is not easy and fundamental solutions are impossible. It is only possible to choose the lesser evils and address the urgent needs of the present, while leaving the more serious and slow-acting issues for the future. Moreover, I have three more suggestions.</p>
<p>Second, the main points of relief should first reduce the disaster area. When the disaster is initially reported, the local authorities summarize the situation. Then, after investigation, some areas may have been flooded for a short time and dried up quickly, while others may not have been severely affected and can be removed from the list. For example, in the sixth year of the Republic, the initial report of the flood in Hebei Province stated that there were over six million disaster victims. Upon detailed review, approximately only one million required relief funds. Reducing the disaster area will make it easier to provide relief. As for the disaster period, it should be shortened. If farmers can obtain bamboo seeds this autumn, they can have food in the spring. If they can obtain grain seeds next spring, they can have food in the autumn, avoiding the need for long-term relief.</p>
<p>(2) The issuance of public bonds should be based on the psychology of the people. Old disaster relief bonds, according to reports, sold for only three yuan per hundred yuan. If another thirty million is issued, it is unlikely that anyone will be willing to purchase them. It seems better to issue them as ordinary public bonds, without calling them disaster relief bonds. The key is to have reliable guarantees.</p>
<p>(3) The administrative expenses and salaries of the disaster relief agencies and personnel should be paid from the national treasury and not use public donations, so as to show compassion and build trust. The Directorate of Hebei Province in the sixth year of the Republic followed this approach. If personnel from various departments can be used to handle disaster relief while still receiving their original salaries, it can save costs.</p>
<p>The above points are only humble opinions and not high-minded arguments. I offer them based on my past experience for your consideration. I would be grateful for your wise judgment. Xiong Xiling.</p>

<h3>Joint Statement by Guangdong Representatives Guangdong</h3>
<p>Representatives Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and Chen Youren issued a joint statement yesterday morning as follows: Today (31st), the newspapers published a telegram from Mr. Chiang to Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen regarding winter defense. This telegram was handed over to our colleagues by Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen. At the time, because it was a confidential telegram, it was not published. Now that Nanjing has generously published it, we should also publish the telegram sent by Mr. Chiang at noon on the 5th. This telegram was also sent by Mr. Chiang to Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen and handed over to our colleagues by the three gentlemen. The Extraordinary Conference elected us as representatives to Shanghai based on this telegram, believing that the previous disputes could be ended. Therefore, we resolutely took on the responsibility of negotiating peace, and we also resolutely took on the responsibility without declining. Now, we are specially disclosing the full text of Mr. Chiang's telegram on the 5th noon as follows: To Commander-in-Chief Chen Zheru and to Mr. Cai and Zhang: All matters concerning Jiang Hai Zhi, Wu Zhi, and Wei Lei are known. With regard to the principles of the telegram, the previous telegram had already expressed approval and was willing to send it out as soon as possible without hesitation. However, at this time of diplomatic emergency, when survival hangs in the balance, there cannot be a government for even a day. Although the wording of the telegram indicated a willingness to step down after the telegram was sent, the psychology of the people at home and abroad and the actual situation was that the situation had already entered a state of anarchy. How could the government allow it to remain in a state of suspension for so long at this critical time? Therefore, after the publication of the telegram from Zhongzheng, before the comrades in Guangdong had arrived, there was no one in charge, and if an accident occurred, not only would Zhongzheng be unable to explain himself, but the comrades in Guangdong would also be responsible. It would be best if the comrades in Guangdong could come to Shanghai as soon as possible, or invite Mr. Jingwei, Zhesheng, Xiangqin, Junpei, and the other brothers to come first. If you brothers arrive in Shanghai in the morning, this telegram will be sent in the evening. If you brothers cannot come, then this telegram, for the sake of the country, cannot but be responsible and prudent, and not dare to treat national affairs as child's play. I hope that you brothers will put the country first and not hesitate to put in the effort. How should we proceed? Please discuss with the comrades in Guangdong as soon as possible. Zhongzhi (5) noon.</p>
<p>Based on this, our motive for coming to Shanghai is clear. After arriving in Shanghai, the resolution of the first meeting was that the drafts of the telegrams from both sides would be determined after discussion and the date of publication would be set. Although there was a slight difference in timing compared to the telegram, the spirit was consistent.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Discusses Various Issues Reporters from Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>Interviewed Mr. Wang Jingwei for ten minutes after the adjournment of the meeting. According to Mr. Wang, since the beginning of the preparatory meeting between representatives from Beijing and Guangdong, the issue of unity against foreign aggression has been completely resolved, which fulfills the significance of our coming here to face the national crisis. Other reform matters concerning the party, the military, and the government, the two areas of military affairs and political system, have been completely discussed as of today. The reform of the political system is as published in the past two days. With regard to military affairs, it was decided to abolish the system of commander-in-chief, because in European and American countries, a general headquarters is only established during wartime. In peacetime, the Ministry of the Navy and the Army or the General Staff Headquarters are responsible. After the abolition of the commander-in-chief, there are two proposals for the distribution of his powers: one is to establish a military committee, and the other is to establish a Ministry of Military Affairs and a General Staff Headquarters. In addition, there are party affairs issues. From the perspective of the people's psychology, it seems that they are not very important and that they are the domestic affairs of the Kuomintang and should not be discussed at the meeting. However, as far as we are concerned, if the party affairs are not resolved, then all the military and political issues cannot be resolved. After the adjournment of the meeting today, we will hold a discussion meeting to exchange the opinions of the representatives from both sides on party affairs issues. Party affairs issues cannot be resolved by force and must gather the opinions of all parties to form a compromise and appropriate plan. Because I do not yet know the opinions of the Nanjing side on the resolution of party affairs, I am not in a position to publish them. However, I have always had two points: (1) to break the concept of the legal system and (2) to break the concept of factionalism. Then, the reporters asked Wang whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about the future of the peace conference. Wang replied, "My so-called optimism and pessimism about the future of this meeting is only a question of whether it should be done or not. If I think it should be done, then I will do it, which is optimism. If I think it should not be done, but I still do it, then that is pessimism. This time, I think it is something that should be done, because there can no longer be war in the country today. However, if we want to achieve unification without using force, then this meeting is necessary. This is what the Prime Minister called seeking peace of mind." Wang also said that the discussions at this meeting are first about the reform of the system, then about the methods of changing the system, and finally about the people involved. The reporters then asked Wang, "The newspapers reported that Beijing telegraphed, according to the Central News Agency, that the Guangdong side's proposed party and government reform proposals were considered to violate the party constitution and had been telegraphed to Cai and others. What exactly is the matter?" Wang said, "During today's meeting, I asked Cai and other representatives from Beijing about this. Cai said that they had not received this telegram at all. Therefore, the representatives from Beijing not only denied this, but also need to thoroughly investigate it further. The Guangdong representatives are satisfied," and so on.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of the Peace Conference is Still Satisfactory and Peaceful</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the preparatory meeting, the representatives from both sides have been discussing various issues with sincerity. Yesterday, because the newspapers reported news from the Central News Agency that the major plans of the party and the country could not be decided by a small number of people, it was rumored that the future of the meeting was unlikely to be optimistic. However, this reporter met with Mr. Zhang Puquan yesterday, who said that this meeting is about discussing how to improve the major plans of the party and the country, and the methods discussed are not to be determined at this time. In the future, they will still need to be passed by the Central Executive Committee or the Fourth Plenary Congress. As for Mr. Chiang's attitude, it is still very sincere. Recently, he still sent a letter to us, urging us to actively proceed and adding Mr. Wu Tiecheng as a representative. Judging from this, Mr. Chiang's attitude is naturally clear. Although there are some minor disputes outside the meeting, the spirit of today's meeting is very good, so I am always optimistic about the peace conference.</p>
<p>Also, Cai Yuanpei said to the reporters at the adjournment of the preparatory meeting yesterday, "We have not received this telegram from the newspapers' reports of the Central News Agency. We also do not know who sent this news, so we still need to investigate the source of this news," and so on.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu's Opinions on the Peace Conference - Our Newspaper</h3>
<p>Our reporter visited Mr. Hu Zhantang at his private residence last night and asked him three questions regarding the peace conference. Mr. Hu kindly provided the following answers one by one: (1) Is there reason to be optimistic about the future of the peace conference? Mr. Hu replied that peaceful unification is the most important goal at present, so we should attach great importance to this peace conference and not take it too lightly. The genuine peace is certainly hoped for through the peace conference, but the peace conference itself has no power. It is only effective if both sides can consistently abide by it in practice. If, on the one hand, both parties send representatives to negotiate and communicate, and on the other hand, say that they do not recognize the representatives' negotiations and communications, such a situation is pessimistic. (2) Does the Guangdong side's proposed party and government reform plan violate the party constitution? Mr. Hu replied that it does not violate the party constitution, and the party constitution does not stipulate such restrictions. Furthermore, the National Government has been reorganized three times since 1927, and none of those times were decided by the National Congress. Also, some people now argue that the postponement of the Fourth National Congress violates the party constitution, but in fact, the party constitution clearly states that the National Congress should be convened every two years or one year. Therefore, postponing the Fourth National Congress until next year does not violate the party constitution. (3) If the peace conference breaks down, does the gentleman have any remedies? Mr. Hu replied that he sincerely hopes that the peace conference will succeed. If it fails to meet his expectations, he personally has no power to remedy it, and he is too ill to do anything. Mr. Hu also said that he hopes all parties will thoroughly awaken and achieve the goal of peace, and especially pay attention to the "min" (people) in the Republic of China National Government and the Kuomintang, to create a truly democratic country, and so on.</p>
<h3>Talks to be Held This Morning - Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the preparatory meeting adjourned, the representatives held another discussion session to exchange opinions on party affairs. The Nanjing representatives, after gathering at Wu Tiecheng's residence around 5:00 PM yesterday, believed that it was necessary to discuss the party affairs case in more detail. Therefore, Zhang Ji used the telephone to seek the consent of the Guangdong delegation and scheduled a discussion session to be held at Mr. Wu's residence again at 10:00 AM today for detailed discussions.</p>
<h3>Three Representatives Change to Going to Nanjing Tonight</h3>
<p>Due to the recess of the preparatory meeting for today and tomorrow, the Nanjing representatives appointed Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, and Wu Tiecheng to go to Nanjing last night to discuss party affairs issues with the central government and report on the progress of the preparatory meetings in recent days. Later, because they had to attend a discussion session this morning, they changed the schedule to go to Nanjing tonight.</p>
<h3>Wang, Sun, Wu, etc. Visit Hu Zhantang - Guangdong Side</h3>
<p>Representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Wu Chaoshu, etc., visited Mr. Hu's residence on Meyer Road one after another around 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the results of the meeting and discuss future progress. Sun and Chen left at 5:00 PM, while Wang and others continued to talk until 6:00 PM before leaving Mr. Hu's residence.</p>
<h3>Wang Has No Connection with Minyi Daily - Someone</h3>
<p>Someone asked Wang Jingwei whether Minyi Daily has any connection with him. Wang replied that during the Xinhai Revolution, he and his comrades once ran a newspaper in Tianjin called "Minyi," dedicated to advocating revolution. It was closed down after the founding of the Republic of China. The current Minyi Daily in Shanghai has no connection with him.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Representative Office Relocates - Guangdong Side</h3>
<p>The Guangdong representative office was originally located at the Cangzhou Hotel. From yesterday (the 31st), it has moved to Villa Qunxian, No. 23 Jin Shenfu Road, for office work.</p>
<h3>Education Circles National Salvation Association Telegram to the Whole Country</h3>
<p>To all public organizations, greetings. Twenty years have passed since the founding of the Republic of China. The political program has disintegrated, and chaos has multiplied. The people are suffering in dire straits. The cause of this is that military interference in politics is the root of the problem. Recently, the violent Japanese invaded, and the fate of the country is hanging by a thread. The ruling officials of Nanjing and Guangdong, sharing the concern for the demise of the nation, decided to hold a peace and unification conference in Shanghai. They will unite internally and resist externally, and start anew with the people. This is related to the rise and fall of the country and is what all the people hope to see realized. Therefore, all those who undermine the peace and unification conference or hinder its progress are public enemies of the country and the nation. However, recent newspaper reports indicate that a few military personnel are still resorting to the old tricks of warlords, attempting to make reckless demands on politics. Regardless of the merits of their demands, they are committing the offense of military interference in politics, which the people of the whole country deeply hate and abhor, and affecting the progress of the peace and unification conference. This association, mindful of the difficulties of the times, finds it difficult to remain silent and hopes that all gentlemen from all walks of life will rise up to correct this and strive for national salvation and wipe out shame. The telegram is urgent and cannot express enough hope. We await your orders. Shanghai Education Circles National Salvation Joint Association, humbly.</p>
<h3>Citywide Trade Unions' Telegram to this City</h3>
<p>The 160 trade unions in the city issued a telegram yesterday to promote peace, saying: To Mr. Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing, Mr. Hu Zhantang of Shanghai, Mr. Wang Zhaoming, Mr. Cai Ziming, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Zhang Renjie, Mr. Wu Chaoshu, Mr. Li Xiehe, Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Chen Youren, Mr. Zhang Puquan, Mr. Zou Haibin, Mr. Chen Zhenru, and Mr. Li Wenfan, greetings. It has been more than a month since Japan occupied Liaoning and Jilin, and there is no sign of troop withdrawal. Recently, they have also seized annual revenues and transferred road rights, attempting to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. They harbor fugitive traitors, intending to create a second Korea under their wings. If the Northeast falls, China will fall, how can we be spared? In such a critical situation, even if the elites who are entrusted with heavy responsibilities by the government and the public work together with one heart and one mind and strive against foreign aggression, we are still worried that it will not be enough to reverse the critical situation. However, since the party-state leaders from both Nanjing and Guangdong gathered in Shanghai, many days have passed, and they have been building houses on the road, with no agreement reached. In these difficult times for the country, every inch of time is precious. When opportunities arise, they pass quickly. Delaying for one day is enough to abandon the great plans for national security and resistance against foreign aggression. As the ancients said, "Before the discussion is settled, the army has already crossed the river," which is a true lesson for our country today. During the intense European war, political parties in various countries with different views from the government also abandoned their prejudices and worked together on national affairs, focusing on protecting the country and defending against foreign aggression. How can it be that those who are all believers in the Three People's Principles cannot unite and cooperate? The association, seeing that disaster is imminent, dares to send a telegram to appeal to you to have the spirit of immediate action, seek internal consolidation and unity, and prioritize resisting foreign aggression when the country is in trouble. Lian Xiangru made friends and completely preserved the Zhao state. The way to secure the political foundation and defeat the enemy's plans lies in this one move. The people of the whole country share the same hope, and we only pray that you will adopt it.

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji's Reply to the Life Society Telegram</p>
<p>Continue Efforts to Achieve the Goal</p>
<p>The Life Weekly Society previously sent a telegram of condolences to Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the chief representative of our country, for his lone struggle for the country in the League of Nations. Now, we have learned that the society has received a reply telegram from Representative Shi from Geneva, the original text is as follows: "To Shanghai Life Weekly Society, I am deeply grateful for your kind support. I will continue my efforts to achieve the goal. Shi Zhaoji."</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Stops Japanese from Buying Land</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association of this city sent a letter of warning to Zhang Jianqing yesterday for coming forward to purchase land on behalf of the Japanese, and also sent a letter to the Land Bureau to stop it. The two letters are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Warning to Zhang Jianqing: According to confidential reports, Zhang Jianqing, a Jiangbei native residing at No. 762, Alley 2, Qinren Lane, East Yalu Road, Hongkou, has been working as a coal and sundry foreman on ships for Mitsui Yoko, and has gained the trust of the Japanese. It is recently heard that the foreman has dared to come forward to purchase more than one hundred acres of land in the Yangjing area of ​​Pudong on behalf of Mitsui Yoko. Although Zhang Jianqing is ostensibly the buyer, Mitsui Yoko is actually buying the land. In this difficult situation, if these more than one hundred acres of national land fall into the hands of the Japanese, it is tantamount to opening a landing base for the Japanese navy, and the consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, we report this to your association, and ask you to quickly investigate and find ways to stop it, and investigate Zhang Jianqing and others. According to the report to the association, there are special penalties for selling national land. At this time when the whole country is gritting its teeth against Japan, the foreman dares to go against the world's great injustice and come forward to buy land for Japanese businessmen, which can be said to be without conscience and not of our race. Based on the previous information, we hereby give a severe warning. If you do not repent, the people of the whole country will jointly punish you. Do not regret this. To Zhang Jianqing.</p>
<p>To the Land Bureau: It has been found that Yu Yushu's letter dated the 22nd of this month stated (same as above). According to this, it has been found that the law strictly prohibits the sale of national land, and if the report is true, it is extremely outrageous. In addition to warning Zhang Jianqing to stop voluntarily, we hereby report the situation and request your bureau to review and stop it, which is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Land Bureau.</p>
<h3>Warning Against Loading and Unloading for Japanese Ships</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to Li Rongji yesterday, warning him: According to confidential reports, the goods imported and exported by Japanese ships in Shanghai are loaded and unloaded by workers hired by Li Rongji. Please investigate, etc. It has been found that not loading and unloading for Japanese ships is the fundamental way to resist goods. Even ignorant coolies know not to cooperate with the Japanese and refuse to load and unload. Why is the merchant so numb? We hereby send a letter of warning. If you are found to be loading and unloading on behalf of the Japanese, you will be punished. To Li Leji.</p>
<h3>Advise Against Selling Japanese Yarn with Altered Brands</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Yarn Industry Trade Union yesterday, saying: On the 30th of this month, we received a letter from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this city, stating that due to our people's boycott, the sales and finances of Japanese yarn factories were stagnant and unable to operate, resulting in shutdowns. It is heard that the Japanese have conceived a fantasy, using their habitual tricks of deception, secretly providing funds to British businessmen to help them with their turnover. A compromise has been reached, and the Japanese yarn factories will resume work soon. This is a conspiracy between wolves and dogs, and our merchants must be careful to guard against it. Please consult the British businessmen to not cooperate with immoral transactions that damage their reputation, and notify Chinese merchants not to be deceived by Japanese slaves, and to implement the goal of breaking off relations, etc. According to this, it has been found that the Japanese slaves are cunning and use their cunning everywhere. Your association should notify famous firms to pay close attention and not be fooled, and please forward a letter to various foreign chambers of commerce to investigate and stop them, and advise foreign merchants not to change brands and sell Japanese goods on their behalf, so that the patriotic movement will not be affected. We hereby report the previous information accordingly, and ask you to investigate and deal with it accordingly. It has been found that in addition to the yarn factories established by Chinese merchants, there are only merchants from Britain and Japan who have established factories and manufactured in Shanghai. There are only three British merchants in Shanghai, with only more than 150,000 spindles. The annual output can be investigated. Japanese merchants have more than one million spindles in their yarn factories in Shanghai, and the comparison is no less than seven to one. If they entrust British merchants to sell on their behalf, even if they are good at making fake goods and the output does not match the spindle capacity, it is difficult to hide it from people's eyes. In addition to the fact that this association has sent a letter to the British Chamber of Commerce, asking it to forward it to the merchants stationed in that country, not to be deceived by the Japanese, your association should also urge your colleagues to pay close attention and conduct secret investigations from time to time. If any colleagues still knowingly condone it, they should report it to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for verification and handling according to the example of privately selling Japanese goods, in order to implement the purpose of economic severance.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting Introduction of Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the three industry associations of cotton cloth, local cloth, and mercerized cotton weaving in this city yesterday, saying: It has been found that Shu Zhang, chairman of the Piece Goods Trade Association of Hong Kong, stated in a letter that his colleagues and overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong have been engaged in the piece goods business, and their purpose is to transport goods. It is not that there are no domestic products, but most of them are imported goods. Now that the country is in a state of emergency, the voice of patriotism is shaking our ears. Our colleagues have enthusiasm and are thinking about strategies, but because they are merchants, they can only engage in operations. When it comes to patriotism, they should take the promotion of national goods as the premise. However, the types of domestic goods that our friends have transported and sold in the past are few and cannot meet the needs of the market. We have always admired the fact that your port has many factories, and there must be many good products among the various types of cloth woven. In order to promote domestic goods, our company hereby sends a letter to your association, hoping that you can help us investigate the weaving factories in your port that are completely domestic and have no foreign shares. Regardless of the cloth they produce, please send samples and the factory name and the name, length, and width of the cloth to our association, so that we can inform our friends and promote it vigorously. This method is not only a plan for the factories in your port to sell goods, but also expresses the sincerity of our colleagues in loving the country. Therefore, we send this letter to you and hope that you will investigate and forward the samples of cloth produced by the factories under your jurisdiction, so that we can reply.</p>
<h3>Stop Japanese Coal from Being Sold with Altered Brands</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association yesterday to prevent Japanese coal from being sold with altered brands, the letter saying: According to confidential reports, Yuchang Coal Store at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Catholic Church Street in this port specializes in Fushun and Red Coal from Mitsui Yoko and other Japanese coal. Recently, in view of the tense anti-Japanese situation and its impact on business, it is planning to find ways to change the name of Japanese coal in an attempt to sell it by mixing it with other coal. Please pay attention to this matter, etc. In addition to sending personnel to investigate, we hereby send a letter to your association to verify and prevent this from happening. To the Coal Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Letter Replying to the Method of Identifying White Sugar</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association of Jiangsu Province, explaining the method of identifying white sugar. According to a letter from you, many suspected Japanese sugar and other goods have been seized, which seem to be Japanese goods repackaged and sold deceptively. Therefore, the association has appointed Wu Lianqing, a standing committee member of the association, and Wei Changshou, a representative of the Zhenjiang Student Anti-Japanese Association, to bring samples of goods to your association and ask you to identify them on their behalf in order to deal with them accordingly. We hereby send a letter to you and hope that you will investigate and reply. According to this, we immediately sent it to the Investigation Department for investigation. Now, according to the report, after receiving the order, we followed it and selected members familiar with the sugar industry to carefully identify it. According to them, the sample bags have been transferred to many places and are difficult to distinguish. However, there are several ways to distinguish white sugar, which are listed below: (1) Japanese sugar has fine sand, is easy to dissolve when it enters the mouth, and has a mutton smell. (2) Jardine Matheson and Taikoo sugars have coarser sand, are not easy to dissolve when they enter the mouth, and have no mutton smell. (3) The Netherlands has two types of coarse sand, and the goods are all packed in large hemp bags, with a fresh and sweet sugar taste. (4) China has many types of coarse sand, fine sand, and rock sugar. The sugar water is white, and the sugar cubes are of different sizes, which is better than Japanese products. Japanese products are yellow and mostly flat, and they cannot be imported now because it is not cost-effective. Chinese white sugar is similar to the Dutch type. We hereby report the above information. After careful review, it is indeed reasonable. We hereby reply to your letter truthfully and hope that you will investigate and deal with it accordingly.

<h3>Preparing to Establish a Domestic Goods Guidance Center</h3>
<p>○The China Vocational Education Society believes that the most effective passive boycott in the current anti-Japanese national salvation is economic severance and not using Japanese goods, and the fundamental way is to revitalize domestic goods.

The proposal was unanimously passed, and it is now scheduled to invite leaders from domestic goods factories and business circles at 3:00 PM on November 3 to discuss the organization methods.</p>

<h3>A Solution Has Been Discussed for the Relief of the Coal Shortage</h3>
<p>Shipping Companies Will Give Priority to Ships for Coal Transportation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Coal Industry Association, and the Shipping Association held a joint meeting the day before yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss the relief of the coal shortage problem.

Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting, and Wu Jichun took the minutes. The results of the discussion were as follows: (1) In the future, coal merchants and shipping merchants can contact each other individually regarding loading and transportation matters. If any price disputes occur, the committee will resolve them through public discussion, and both parties should abide by the decision. (2) The shipping industry is responsible for giving priority to its members' ships for coal transportation to alleviate the coal transportation problem. (3) In order to meet the current urgent needs, all ships going to Tanggu to transport coal will be dispatched by Sanbei Company and China Merchants Bureau, two ships each, which will be arranged by Yu Qiaqing, and Chen Bogang will be responsible for dispatching two ships, making a total of six ships.

It is now agreed that each ship will load half a load in Tanggu and half a load in Qingdao. The transportation price per ton must be 3.6 yuan plus 5 cents to the original price. Of these 5 cents, the Coal Industry Association acknowledges 2 cents, and the shipping company acknowledges 1 cent.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Provoke Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Indiscriminately Beating Workers</p>
<p>The Japanese Marines stationed in the western part of Shanghai have been dispatching large teams of Japanese soldiers to and from various roads in recent days, creating a menacing situation and constantly seeking trouble and intimidating women and children. This has long been witnessed by the public. At around 10:35 a.m. yesterday, at the vacant lot behind the Guohua Middle School at the intersection of Gordon Road and Robison Road in the western part of Shanghai, a bamboo fence built by Jiangbei people was already damaged and dilapidated. More than a dozen Jiangbei men, women, and children were dismantling the fence when, unexpectedly, more than a dozen Japanese Marines, fully armed, rushed to the scene. Nearby workers were shocked to see this, and dozens of people gathered to watch. The Japanese soldiers, without asking for any explanation, used wooden sticks and gun butts to violently beat the workers. The situation was chaotic. Fortunately, the crowd saw the opportunity and immediately fled and dispersed, avoiding being beaten, injured, or arrested. Only two or three women were slightly injured. Afterwards, several Japanese soldiers were stationed in the vacant lot. It is reported that the reason for the incident was that there was a Japanese residence of a certain yarn factory next to the bamboo fence. The Japanese resident saw people dismantling the bamboo fence and immediately reported it to the Gordon Road Japanese Marine Corps headquarters, which dispatched soldiers to protect it. Therefore, the Japanese sailors rushed to the scene and immediately began to beat people indiscriminately. From this, we can see the ferocity of the Japanese sailors, who are constantly seeking trouble and causing incidents.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping or Abduction?</h3>
<p>Forcibly Dragging a Young Boy into a Car</p>
<p>Thugs Claim to Have an Official Letter</p>
<p>Two Women are Highly Suspicious</p>
<p>Xu A'gen, a peddler from Wuxi who resides at 1041 Yangzhou Road, had an empty front building in his house a month ago. An old woman from Anhui who lived nearby introduced two women from Anhui, Yin Zhao (32 years old) and Xu Shuai (26 years old), to rent the building, bringing with them two boys and one girl. A man came to the building to stay overnight every few days. Xu assumed that he must be the husband of one of the two women and did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, at 8:15 p.m. the day before yesterday, six fools arrived in a car, rushed upstairs, and dragged a boy of about ten years old downstairs. The child cried. Xu saw this situation and found it very suspicious. He stepped forward to question them. The men glared and said, "We have an official letter to take this child. You don't need to interfere. Please be sensible." Then they dragged the child into the car and drove away quickly. Xu was shocked by this situation and immediately reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. Head Constable Li immediately dispatched Chinese detectives Zhang Yunjian and other detectives to secretly investigate the address and arrest the two Anhui women, Yin and Xu. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the women's detention center. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Ji Tianyin, explained the situation, stating that the two women's statements at the police station were very evasive. They both claimed not to know the origin of the child. It is speculated that the child was either kidnapped or abducted, which cannot be determined. According to what the men claimed, they had an official letter to take the child, but this must go through the police station's procedures. Therefore, it is requested that the two women be detained temporarily pending a clear investigation. However, the two women were not at home when the incident occurred. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details. Furthermore, the second landlord, Xu A'gen, reported that after the two women moved in, a man came to stay, claiming to be a worker at a factory, but he rarely came to rest. The two women also claimed to be factory workers. He also stated that the old woman who introduced the rental suddenly moved elsewhere yesterday. When questioned, Yin Zhao confessed to renting the front building for more than a month. She did not know the man. Xu Shuai was her cousin. The ten-year-old boy was sent by another man. The language he spoke was not from the same place. She did not know where he was from. She provided evasive answers. Xu Shuai confessed that her husband worked in the countryside. She did not know the man either. She rented a bed in Yin Zhao's place through the introduction of the old woman next door, paying two yuan per month. Her seven-year-old boy is named Xiao Mao, and another girl is named Xiao Yitou. As for where the ten-year-old boy came from, she did not know. Please investigate. After Judge Shen Bingrong reviewed the confessions, he ordered the two women to be detained and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jumping Off the Train Without a Ticket Disregarding Life</h3>
<p>Appears to be a Villager, Life in Danger</p>
<p>At around 2 p.m. yesterday, when the Shanghai-Songjiang 127th passenger train arrived at the Baotouwan station and was hoisting its flag, a passenger on the train, wearing blue cloth clothes and trousers, about thirty years old, and appearing to be a villager, jumped off the train because he had not purchased a ticket, causing severe head and leg injuries. He immediately fainted and lost consciousness. The station staff arrived and tried their best to rescue him. After a long time, he finally woke up, but he was covered in blood and looked terrible. He was taken back to Shanghai by the same train and sent to the railway hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries are quite serious, and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Cholera Report from the Port Quarantine Office</h3>
<p>The Final Cholera Report of This Year</p>
<p>Wu Liande, Director of the National Port Quarantine Office, issued the fourteenth cholera report yesterday, stating: (1) The cholera epidemic this year has come to an end. Since October 24, no new cases of cholera have been reported in the recent week (ending October 24). Shanghai discovered seven cases of cholera, with three deaths, limited to the Chinese area only. (2) The cholera situation this year, according to reports from various parties, is summarized as follows: A. The date of the first confirmed case was August 8, and the date of the last case was October 23. This cholera epidemic in Shanghai lasted for 76 days. B. During this epidemic period, there were 482 patients (including 11 foreigners), of whom 57 died (excluding four foreigners, all of whom were Chinese). The mortality rate was 11.8%. C. Patients were scattered throughout Shanghai and not limited to a specific area, specifically unsanitary places. D. The number of patients varied, with the highest points being September 1 and September 26, when 16 cholera cases were discovered each day. E. In the seven hospitals set up for Chinese people, there were 419 cholera patients seeking treatment, including 260 men and 189 women (the gender ratio was 58% to 42%). F. The age distribution was inconsistent, but most patients were between the ages of four and sixty, with 139 patients between the ages of 21 and 30, followed by 107 patients between the ages of 31 and 40. Generally speaking, most cholera patients were middle-aged. (3) Regarding the severe floods along the Yangtze River this year, the health authorities in various places were able to step up their work. Fortunately, they prepared for prevention early on, so cholera and dysentery were minimized in the vast disaster area of Wuhan. Although the diagnosis of the disease in that area was not as accurate as in Shanghai, the number of cholera cases in the area with a population of tens of millions was only about a thousand. (4) The three health agencies in Shanghai have each reported the number of cholera vaccinations this year. The numbers are listed below for comparison with last year's report:</p>
<p>1920 1921</p>
<p>Shanghai City 404,675 553,446</p>
<p>Public Concession 66,338 162,939</p>
<p>French Concession 66,021 63,874</p>
<p>Total 537,034 761,279</p>
<p>In addition to the numbers mentioned above, this office also sent medical officers to supervise vaccinations in Hankou, vaccinating 10,500 people, and in Nanjing, vaccinating 6,000 people. In short, the cholera epidemic in Shanghai this year was relatively mild. Although the activity and toxicity of the bacteria increased compared to the past, the cholera disease fortunately did not spread and expand, which is gratifying. The reasons for this are as follows: A. The health authorities prepared for all matters in advance, such as cleaning drinking water, fly control, improving housing, and health education campaigns. These were all the key points. B. The number of vaccinations increased, especially for factory workers, boat dwellers, and all the poor who were susceptible to the disease. C. The well-equipped hospitals and early saline injections were able to reduce the number of deaths to the smallest possible number. D. All sectors have made progress in general hygiene knowledge. E. Perhaps the weather this year was suitable for preventing the survival of bacteria. This cholera report is the last one for this year. I (Wu himself) deeply thank the heads of the three health agencies for providing all the news about cholera every week, and the assistance of the hospital directors, physicians, and the Shanghai Health Laboratory is especially important. With this spirit of cooperation, it is not difficult to eradicate cholera in Shanghai. It is estimated that Shanghai's population may increase to five million within five years.</p>

<h3>Setting Up a School to Collect Money Sichuan Woman Detained for Three Months</h3>
<p>Private Prosecution Partially Transferred to Civil Court</p>
<p>Jiang Ziquan, a woman from Qionglai, Sichuan, known as Keqiang, has been living in Shanghai for many years. She claims to have served as the president of the China Women's Mutual Aid Association, the organization section chief of the Shanghai Tenants' Association, and the principal of the Ziquan Women's Vocational School. On the surface, she seems to be a person enthusiastic about social undertakings. She has contacts with Xu Guowen, the principal of the Shanghai Huigong Primary and Secondary School and the director of education of the Third Huigong Primary School. Therefore, the school founded by Jiang at 47 Yanping Road in Shanghai West is also named Huigong School. It also has an affiliated China Women's Vocational Development Company, with Jiang serving as the professor and general manager. However, what kind of vocational development the women want to develop is not clear to the outside world. Recently, Jiang purchased two sewing machines from the Singer Company, saying that female students needed to purchase sewing machines, and agreed to pay in installments, with Xu Guowen as the guarantor. Unexpectedly, Jiang pledged the machines she had obtained on credit to the pawnshop without delay, obtaining 240 yuan. Later, the Singer Company found out and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Liang Yuliang to investigate and verify the facts. It was also discovered that Jiang had previously posted advertisements to deceive people under the pretext of hiring teachers and accountants. Shen Weinong was defrauded of 75 silver dollars because he wanted to be an accountant. Wang Jianbing and Shi Huimin both wanted to be teachers. Wang was defrauded of 22 yuan, and Shi's loss was small, only being defrauded of two gold pieces. The detective then sent Jiang Ziquan and the evidence seized to the First Special District Local Court for questioning. Jiang's confession involved Xu Guojun a lot. After the newspaper published the report, students from the Third Huigong School sent a special letter to various newspapers to defend Xu, and also described how Jiang Ziquan was poor in the past and was helped by Xu. The school currently run by Jiang is actually named Huimin, etc. However, the evidence seized by the police and the letter of engagement to Wang Jianbing all only had the words "Huiqun Girls' School" with the seal of the Third Huigong School below. Only one receipt had the word "qun" changed to "min" in ink. Therefore, when the First Special Court continued the trial yesterday morning, Xu Guojun was also summoned to testify. Xu denied other relationships except for stating that he had repeatedly helped Jiang because she was poor in the past. When questioned, Jiang confessed that the school was actually opened by Xu, and the tuition fees collected all went to Xu, and everything in the school was provided by Xu. The affiliated company was also co-founded by Xu, with her serving as the general manager, Xu's sister serving as the deputy manager, and Xu serving as the supervisor. After the machines were pledged, the pawn tickets were managed by Xu. Why should he deny everything? At the end, the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the defendant's fraudulent behavior had been confirmed and requested that she be punished according to the law. Judge Cheng Shangfeng immediately announced that Jiang Ziquan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for fraud. The private prosecution part was ordered to be transferred to the civil court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Rape a Woman Under the Age of Twenty</h3>
<p>Fei Jinpu Sentenced to Five Months of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Fei Jinpu, the owner of the Dexing Clothing Store at 117 Song Road, Hongkou, and his wife, Fei Chenshi, and Chen Zhu, a friend of Chen, were recently sued by their sister-in-law, Chen Fengguan, and their brother-in-law, Chen Ziliang, through lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng, for conspiring to force rape, inciting suicide, and defrauding property in the First District Court. The main point of the lawsuit is that Chen Fengguan is Chen Ziliang's younger sister, and the youngest is now only nineteen years old. Her second sister married Fei Jinpu, that is, Fei Chenshi. During the period of the Republic of China in 1918, the plaintiff's mother died, leaving Chen Fengguan 3,000 yuan for purchasing dowry for her future marriage. Unexpectedly, Fei Chenshi returned to Ningbo during the mother's funeral and learned that her sister had the cash. She devised a plan to trick Chen Fengguan into bringing the cash to Shanghai and then used sweet words to ask her to hand over the cash and open a clothing store together. Fengguan was young and ignorant and, in addition, was a sibling with Fei Chenshi and had no doubts about him, so she was defrauded. In early November of the nineteenth year, Fei Chenshi falsely claimed to be going to Jiangbei to collect debts. When there were no women at home, the defendant Fei Jinpu forced Chen Fengguan into rape. Later, Fei Chenshi returned to Shanghai and instead said that Fengguan did not care about shame and actually committed adultery with her husband, and sent a letter to her brother Ziliang. The 3,000 yuan deposit was also embezzled. Later, on August 14 of this year, she suddenly suffered from colluding with her friend Chen Zhusan to lure Chen Fengguan to his home and forced her to write a note saying that she had no financial dealings with Fei Jinpu. Because she did not allow it, she was tied up and beaten severely. At the same time, Fei Chenshi claimed that she would have to add a new Detai clothing store soon, which was reliable. Fengguan realized that the words were false and was sobbing. Fei Chenshi forced Chen Fengguan to swallow opium to commit suicide, so as to avoid scandal from spreading and to achieve the purpose of swallowing money. This case was summoned for questioning twice by Judge Wu Tingqi. At that time, the trial could not be concluded because the witnesses were not complete. Yesterday was the date of the review. First, the waiter Zhu Yuting of the Zhongnan Hotel and other witnesses stated that on August 9 this year, Fei Jinpu changed his surname to Bei and brought a woman (pointing out Chen Fengguan) to open room 309 for five days, and then changed to room 302 for five days, and then returned to room 309 for one day, etc. Questioning Fei Jinpu Fei Chenshi said that this was because his brother-in-law borrowed money unsuccessfully and made false accusations. The Zhongnan Hotel stayed overnight because Chen Ziliang forced it, etc. Then Judge Wu repeatedly interrogated him and pronounced the sentence in court. The main text said, Fei Jinpu was sentenced to five months of imprisonment for intending to rape a woman under the age of twenty. The other parts were not guilty. Fei Chenshi Chen Zhusan was not guilty.</p>

<p>Guomin News said that the City Silk Cotton Textile Industry Association once sent a telegram to the Social Bureau, requesting the dismissal of more than 5,000 employees due to the rejection of Japanese goods and the shortage of raw materials. After the Social Bureau sent a letter to the City Party Department for consultation, the City Party Department replied, requesting rejection. The original telegram is recorded below: To the respondents, Case No. 15522 of your bureau stated that the Silk Cotton Textile Industry Association applied for the dismissal of employees due to the rejection of Japanese goods and the shortage of raw materials, which was discussed and decided at the bureau meeting and ordered to be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law. However, due to the importance of the matter, it is hereby notified for review and reply. Accordingly, although the industry intends to reduce the scope and dismiss workers due to the rejection of Japanese goods and the shortage of raw materials, this should be a temporary phenomenon and there will be no way to remedy it in the future. It has been found that in addition to Japanese goods, there are not absolutely no alternatives for the raw materials used in the industry. Even if it is absolutely necessary to reduce the scope during this transitional period, workers should not be dismissed to the extent of more than 5,000 people, causing a large number of workers to be unemployed innocently and allowing a small number of factories that are not very enlightened to take the opportunity to dismiss workers, destroy the labor movement, and cause future troubles. For the present plan, if the factory is indeed temporarily short of raw materials and must reduce the scope, it may be appropriate to reduce the wages of the workers or temporarily issue some maintenance fees for the reduced part of the work after the Party and government organs have verified the facts, so as to avoid innocent unemployment of workers and to find alternative raw materials to remedy the situation, instead of taking this opportunity to dismiss workers and harm public order. The previous reasons for the letter are hereby replied, hoping that you will check and reject them to strengthen public relations.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Steamers Formally Suspend Service Today</h3>
<p>Nisshin Steamship Halts Two-Thirds of its Fleet</p>
<p>Retains Four Vessels to Maintain Yangtze River Navigation Rights</p>
<p>Upper Yangtze Steamers Cease Operations Since the boycott of Japanese goods by the populace, all ports along the Yangtze River have unanimously ceased loading onto Japanese vessels. Consequently, Nisshin Steamship's Upper Yangtze steamers operating on the Shanghai-Shashi-Yichang line experienced a complete lack of cargo and passengers from mid-last month. Initially, the Daikichi Maru and Dairiki Maru were the first to suspend their scheduled services. Subsequently, due to dockworkers refusing to load and unload vessels traveling the Chongqing-Yichang route along the Sichuan River, followed by the complete resignation of all river pilots, all upstream vessels were forced to cease operations entirely, with the ships moored at Hankou.</p>
<p>Two Months of Empty Voyages The Nisshin Steamship Company's Yangtze River fleet, once the major base for Japanese encroachment on Yangtze River navigation rights, had gradually surpassed the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Companies in recent years (referring to the Yangtze River route). Since the Wanpaoshan Incident and the subsequent boycott of Japanese goods in our country, the company's Yangtze River operations have suffered a setback. With the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, Chinese merchants in Shanghai, Hankou, and other ports completely severed ties with Japanese vessels. For the past two months, despite scheduled services, there has been no cargo, resulting in empty voyages. Each ship loses at least 300 yuan daily. Last month, a proposed lease to the British firm Jardine Matheson was rejected. Unable to sustain the losses, the company has implemented a suspension of operations.</p>
<p>Service Suspended from Today, as the company receives subsidies from the Japanese government, the suspension of service is subject to the orders of Tokyo. Last month, after the failed lease attempt, the company telegraphed its head office in Japan, reporting that the upstream vessels had already ceased operations entirely. The Yangtze River fleet's operations could not be expected to recover in a short period, leaving suspension of service as the only viable option. Upon receiving a response from Tokyo, authorizing a partial suspension of the Yangtze River fleet, the company, after consultation, designated the Xiangyang Maru, Yueyang Maru, Mizuho Maru, and Nanyang Maru for suspension, effective today. These vessels will be towed to the Pudong wharves for mooring.</p>
<p>Retaining Navigation Rights While the company should, based on the current situation, suspend all services, for the sake of maintaining Yangtze River navigation rights, it cannot completely cease operations. It was thus decided to reluctantly retain the Luoyang Maru, Fengyang Maru, Daitei Maru, and Daifuku Maru, operating empty services to ensure a future foothold for recovery. The initial suspension of four vessels will reduce monthly losses by 65,000 yuan. Starting today, services will be reduced to one vessel departing for Hankou every three days, with vessels moored in Shanghai at Hongkou instead of Pudong.</p>
<p>Chinese Crew Dismissed The vessels already suspended include the Yiyang Maru, Yunyang Maru, Changyang Maru, Daikichi Maru, Dairiki Maru, Jialing Maru, Fuling Maru, and Baling Maru. In addition to these, the Chinese crew members, sailors, and tea servers on the Xiangyang, Mizuho, and Nanyang Yueyang Maru vessels are being dismissed. The company still operates several shallow-draft vessels on the Xiang-E line (Hunan-Hubei), but while they have not suspended operations, they carry no cargo or passengers and are currently being used to transport Japanese residents upstream near Hankou, it is said.</p>
<h3>Pacific Institute Debate on the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Expresses Apology</p>
<p>The Pacific Institute has been holding discussions on the Northeast problem for several days. Many Chinese and Japanese representatives have spoken, and the atmosphere at the meeting has been quite tense. Although the Japanese representatives are more enlightened than their country's military and political authorities, they inevitably engage in forced defenses of their national policy. The Chinese representatives, in their speeches, base their arguments on justice, fairness, and international law. Individuals from various countries have expressed much sympathy for our nation. This is a general overview of the situation up to Wednesday (the 28th). After Wednesday, the Japanese side suddenly abandoned their defensive posture and adopted an offensive one. On the evening of that day, when Mr. Takayanagi lectured on diplomatic organs, he gratuitously raised the issue of China's national qualifications. Although he attributed this to a certain British legal scholar, the audience was quite surprised and puzzled, as it had no connection to the topic of his lecture. On Thursday morning, during a roundtable conference, Mr. Takayanagi sat at the same table as the Chinese representative, Mr. Chen Liting. Mr. Chen seized the opportunity to question him, stating that since the Japanese people deny China's national qualifications, it is no wonder that they invade with impunity, as if there were no one else around. Mr. Takayanagi evaded the question, claiming that he was merely quoting the words of a scholar from another country and that he himself and the Japanese people do not acknowledge this. His response appeared quite flustered. At 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, four roundtable conferences held a general assembly for the final presentation on our country's diplomatic problems. Mr. Chen Liting, the representative of our country, spoke first, stating that China's diplomatic negotiations are actually divided into two major parts. Dealing with countries other than Japan is a matter of rectifying and amending things, which is a lighter task. Dealing with Japan, on the other hand, is a matter of life and death, and the work is heavier. He then briefly described Japan's policy of aggression and acts of aggression, and vehemently refuted Mr. Takayanagi's fallacy that China is a country without sovereignty. His words were solemn and moving, and all who listened were moved. The Japanese side, embarrassed and angered, began with Mr. Nitobe, the leader of the Japanese delegation, questioning the British representative Mr. Ross, the chairman, as to whether Mr. Chen's remarks violated the rules of the conference, with the intention of preventing Mr. Chen from speaking. The chairman replied that Mr. Chen's remarks did not raise any issues with the rules of the conference and allowed Mr. Chen to continue speaking until he had said everything he wanted to say. Mr. Takayanagi and the American representative, Mr. Stuart, then spoke. After Mr. Stuart finished speaking, Mr. Nitobe, the Japanese representative, suddenly stood up again and loudly stated that Mr. Chen's speech was an insult to Japan and the Japanese representatives, causing a great commotion throughout the hall. Chen Liting stood up and stated that the main points of his speech were all based on facts and that he had absolutely no intention of denigrating anyone. If the facts he stated were too straightforward and caused the Japanese representatives to misunderstand, then he was very sorry. The Japanese representatives, Mr. Sato and Mr. Maeda, spoke simultaneously and noisily, making it impossible to discern what they were saying. At this point, representatives from various countries could no longer tolerate it and shouted, "Conference rules, conference rules!" The chairman then ordered Mr. Sato to sit down and announced that the time was up and that no further speeches could be made. The heated debate and turmoil came to an end. It was reported that the representatives from various countries were dissatisfied with the Japanese representatives' raving and loss of composure and were especially disappointed in Mr. Nitobe, who was highly respected. After this incident, the representatives from various countries all looked worried, believing that the Pacific Conference could not maintain the peace of the conference, let alone anything else. The authorities in charge of the conference then intervened to mediate, so that the two sides would not break down due to the dispute. On the morning of the 31st, before the roundtable conference, a general assembly was held, during which the chairman read a letter from Mr. Chen, stating that he was quite uneasy that his remarks yesterday morning might have hurt the feelings of the Japanese representatives. Next, Mr. Nitobe stepped forward to shake hands with Mr. Chen, indicating that the misunderstanding had been completely resolved. Mr. Takayanagi pointed out the omissions in his speech on Wednesday night and asked the Chinese representatives for forgiveness. The turmoil then came to an end, and the representatives from various countries turned their worries into joy.</p>
<p>The Pacific International Institute will hold its final conference tomorrow and then close. The board of directors will hold a meeting once on Wednesday. The representatives are scheduled to leave Shanghai on Wednesday and return to their countries. Li Zhaohuan, the president of Jiaotong University, held a tea party at the Hua An Hotel yesterday on behalf of the Shanghai University Federation to welcome the representatives. He then invited the representatives to visit the Xujiahui Observatory. French Consul General Gangremlin, Chief Customs Officer Merloh, and Yang Nianzu, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, were also invited to participate.</p>
<h3>Hua Shang Electric Employees Fully Resume Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Prevents Workers from Holding General Assembly</p>
<p>All Workers Demand Equal Treatment</p>
<p>After all employees of the Shanghai Hua Shang Electric Company resumed work, the Hua Shang trams fully resumed operations yesterday morning. The Public Security Bureau, under orders, prevented the general assembly of all workers. Yesterday, the workers demanded equal treatment with the employees. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Resumption Situation After all the employees resumed work at 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, in order to avoid the company's losses from operating trams without selling tickets, measures were immediately taken to restore ticket sales. The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union also sent directors and supervisors to notify all members to go to the company to collect tickets. Therefore, after 6:00 p.m., all trams operating on various routes resumed selling tickets. It is reported that the company lost more than 5,000 yuan during the two days of the go-slow strike when the trams were operating without selling tickets.</p>
<p>Prevention of Assembly The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, which is the general assembly of all workers of the Hua Shang Electric Company, convened a general assembly of all members at the union on Guohuo Road at 9:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. When more than 600 members arrived, Chen Xizeng, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, under the order of the mayor, sent a patrol officer from the Second District Police Station to prevent the meeting. The directors and supervisors of the union immediately complied and stopped the meeting, and explained to all the members, saying that the employees' go-slow strike was due to the conditions of treatment and had nothing to do with the workers. The operation of trams without selling tickets was caused by the employees stopping issuing tickets. Please do not misunderstand. However, all the workers demanded the same treatment as the employees.</p>
<p>Workers' Demands After the employees' treatment conditions at the Hua Shang Electric Company were resolved, all the workers demanded that the company treat the workers and employees equally. The reason is that the workers and employees have been serving the company together and have always had the same treatment. Moreover, in the past, when the workers proposed longevity savings, retirement pensions, and bonuses, the employees and workers enjoyed the same benefits. Moreover, the employees had their salaries increased this year, and this time they received a special salary increase. Therefore, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, based on the request of all the workers, accepted the workers' wishes and sent directors and supervisors to the company to demand this yesterday, and posted slogans such as "Demand that the company increase salaries for workers and employees equally" and "Demand that the company treat workers and employees equally."</p>
<h3>After the Resumption of Work at Zhonghua and Minzhi, the Municipal Government Convened Arbitration Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Capital Still Refuses to Reinstate Workers Li Jin and Two Laborers</p>
<p>After all the employees of the Shanghai Zhonghua and Minzhi bookstores resumed work in accordance with the order, the Zhonghua worker Li Hongbin and the Minzhi worker Jin Shifa were both refused reinstatement. All the employees of the two bureaus were quite indignant because the capital violated government orders and repeatedly refused reinstatement, and were preparing to make further expressions to promote the capital's awareness. Fortunately, the publishing industry union persuaded them, and it did not become a reality. Currently, the union has submitted a request to the party and government organs for compulsory execution. If there is still no way, it is feared that a major problem will occur. As for the treatment conditions of Zhonghua employees, the Municipal Government Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee arbitrated at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The chairman, Municipal Government Counselor Sun Baorong, members Huang Zhaoxiong of the Municipal Party Department, Luo Qinghua, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhao Shusheng, the representative of all labor in the city, Lu Bohong, Wu Jingyuan, the representatives of the capital, Yang Youren, and Wang Wenhua, after the chairman persuaded both parties, the result was that representatives would be selected by the labor side within the next week to negotiate a resolution with the capital. If there is no result, it will be submitted for arbitration again.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Warship Officially Rejoins Fleet Today</h3>
<p>Foreign Flag Change to Be Held on 12th</p>
<p>The Navy's Fifth Minsheng new warship has been fully completed and is scheduled to officially rejoin the fleet today in accordance with the Ministry's order. All officers and soldiers are also organized as usual. The ship's captain, Zheng Gongyao, was originally scheduled to take office today, but because the Navy Department changed the ship's foreign flag change to the 12th of this month, Captain Zheng also changed his oath of office to the same day, it is said.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Store Stamps to Begin Today</h3>
<p>Tax Bureau Sends Circulars for Notification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent circulars to various industry trade associations, stating, "The Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau has approved the case and sent a letter stating that the period for inspecting stamps for the second half of this year is approaching. Our bureau is now scheduled to begin inspection on November 1st. We will divide the city and township areas under our jurisdiction into groups and dispatch personnel to work with the police to implement the inspection in order. Correspondingly, we hereby request your association to check and notify the various industry guilds to inform them, etc. It is hereby sent, please check and inform the affiliated merchants."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Already Has a Resolution on the Hou Dachun Case</h3>
<p>The Central Committee and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association have accused Hou Dachun, a member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, of embezzling donations. The Central Committee had ordered the Municipal Party Department to investigate and reply, and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association also requested the Municipal Party Department to investigate. It is now reported that the Municipal Party Department has completed the investigation. Yesterday morning, it convened a special executive committee meeting to discuss and resolve the matter. The facts of the investigation will be reported to the Central Committee, and the legal aspects will be transferred to the court for handling. The investigation report is recorded below for exploration. As a matter of replying, the case查 of the Six Districts Party Department向 the Central Committee呈控 member后大椿 of 背誓诈财触犯刑章,堕损党誉一案,奉钧会临时紧急会议决议,推行白克成·查明见复等因奉此,当即会同前往商務印書館总务处与该馆经理王云五先生谈话询问捐款经过情形,嗣又至巿商会与抗日救国会秘书赵树声谈话,询问以前捐款有无纪录文件,嗣又与该会前检察科干事管理该科账目之陈勣谈话,询问捐款有无入账动用情形,并调阅会议纪录一本账目两册,详如审核谨将所得本案重要各点缕陈于后,(一)捐款之经过 (一)七月十七日,反日援侨会提议被难侨胞应如何援助案议决(丙)由在座委员自动筹募款数,(见反日援侨会会议录)(二)七月十八·九·日据王云五说,约在取款前四五日)后大椿向商务印書館王云五处,劝募救济侨胞捐款,王答,俟商　后再度旋向后说本馆可暂先捐助五百元,救济侨胞急难,(据王云五说)(三)七月二十三日后派王永良携函一件,(见后并附临时收据一张至王云五处,领取援侨救济金五百元,据王云五说)(四)十月二十日清晨后持款五百元,送还商务印書館王云五处商请将临时收据收回据王云五说并见后之呈文,)(二)捐款之性质,查王委员延松在执委会临时会中说明如系救济金则分文不能动用,当时在席诸委员亦主捐款性质及是否移用二点,均须查明当至王云五处,据称当时后募捐公司以信赖反日援侨会,对于捐款用途,初未注意填注支付凭单时,系根据后君来函称「旅鲜侨胞救济金,」当出后大椿致该馆函,内谓「前蒙允捐侨胞救济金洋五百元正,甚为感激」又查该馆支付凭单载明「旅鲜侨胞救济金」,又查该馆复六区党部函亦称「侨胞救济金」,是捐款之性质,业经认捐者,与经募者,均己于文字中显示之矣,(附后及商务两函,)(一)后致王云五函云五先生大鉴,前蒙允「助侨胞救济金」洋五百元正,甚为感激兹请王永良同志趋前祇领希请照给,一俟正式收据印就,再行补换可也此上即请晚安,后大椿,七·廿三,(二)商务复六区函敬复者,奉本日大函,敬悉查前反日援侨会向敝馆募捐「援侨救济金五百元」,系由后大椿君经募,于七月二十三日付出嗣据后君来言因该会改组,该款未曾动用,业于今晨如数交还承询奉复,此致第六区党部执行委员会商务印書館启,二十年十月二十日,(三)募捐之根据,查后委员大椿,在报上发表声明,「反日援侨会成立之初,曾经决议,由各委员募集捐款大椿为委员之一,有劝募之义务,当向商务印書館经理王云五先生募得捐款五百元,曾报告常务委员王晓　王延松陆京士诸先生」,上述声明中有两点,(一)为捐款系根据决议而来,(二)为捐款曾报告常务委员,关于第二点,王延松陶百川陆京士三委员,曾在执委会临时会报告中业经证明确曾听见说过,惟何时领到,及其用途如何则后君未向谈及,故未知等语(参见民国日报十月二十四日王延松之谈话)关于第一点,在反日援侨委员会会议纪录中亦有两条纪载如后,七月十七日下午二时第一次会议第五条,被难侨胞应如何援助案(甲)通电国內外捐助救济金指定上海中商会上海中国·交通·兴业·中央·等六银行,四行储蓄会·福源钱庄·为收款机关(乙呈国府拨款一百万元派员前往营救(丙)由在座各委员自动筹募款数(二)七月二十三日下午一时,继续开第二次会第(二案,本会经费应如何筹措案决议,向巿党部商借洋五万元,推王延松陶百川后大椿向巿党部接洽,以上两条纪录(一)为捐助救济侨胞者,各委员应照内项自动筹募款数,(二) 筹措经费者,系推王陶后一,委员,向巿党部商借此外并无他种决议可资查考可知后委员之募款必系根据前条救济金之议案者,(四)捐款之报告据后委员在报上声明,一向王云五募得捐款五百元曾经报告常务委员王晓籁王延松陆京士诸先生」,逼查会中一切纪录并无此项捐款纪载惟据王委员延松,于巿执委会第一次临时会报告,「大椿同,志自募得王云五之五百元后曾向我说过,并表示榆快之,意当时因止式收据未出,想出临时收据,当时我不赞成惟　济　丝毫不得动用,有议案可查」,(见纪录)又云,「现悉大椿己将该款送还商务書館此实错误」,(见纪录)又据委员陆京士报告,「后大椿同志,曾在私人谈话间,对我说,过商务募款五百元之事,则有之,至该款属于何种性质何种用途,何时领到,则不得而知也」,可见捐款向人说,过确系事实,惜系私人谈话,并非正式开会中报告,故会中无文件可稽,五)捐款之移用,此项商务印書館援侨救济金五百元,据后委员说,「大椿时什检察科主任,感于会中经济拮据工作进行困难当商得其他常务委员之同意将此款先行调用俟会中正式收据印就后再将此款转账」,查此项救济金移作会中之用询据抗日救国会秘书赵树声说,以前并未有正式文件通知秘书处与会计科故移交案中,无从查考,又查检察科收款暂记簿中见有七月二十四日收「后主任」五百元,又于八月六日收「后主任」洋五十元,两共计五百五十元,而于八月八日收(反日会会计股拨还垫款洋二千元后,即载「还巿民大会垫洋四百六十元若再还后主任垫款五百五十元,则尚有垫款九百九十元,未见列账,究系何人所,垫无从查核,又十月四日下,有总结「共收一万二千二百零一元三角五厘」,内应扣除还「后主任」洋五百五十元,据后委员及该科管理账目之干事陈勣说,前项后主任五百五十元内有五百元即系商务之损款惟无文字注明,无法取证,且商务捐款,何以变成后主任之私款亦属疑问,又查抗日救国会之侦察部九月二十二日成立)账目,则九月二十日,有收后手商捐款洋二百六十二元二角三分五厘又十月四日收会计处拨还商捐(后手二百三十七元七角六分五厘又十月二十日支还后捐商款五百元字样是在账面上商捐二字,系见于改组抗日救国会后之侦察部账项中,并非后委员在反日援侨会兼任检察科时代该项账簿虽用经一月颇见 洁,惟内载日期,则发现略有顚倒涂改之处(六)捐款之救据,据后委员在呈中央文中略谓「时援侨救济金正式据尚未印就会中一切工作,需款进行,故疑先将此项募金收来移垫,请会中先出临时收据免增手续」此点会中无正式文件可资证明,惟王延松先生曾承认当时有此向彼说过之事实,又后在呈中央文中,说「原拟俟会中正式收据印就后,立将此款提出移送乃以反日会主席虞洽卿先生未在募捐正式收据上盖印,而不能应用」,此点询据该会常务委员陶百川先生云,会中正式收据印就后各委员均己盖章,惟虞洽卿先生不愿盖章,因不赞成将救济金移作会内经费之用,故至今并未用,又查救济金于七月十七日第一次会议,指定巿商会上海中国交通兴业中央等银行及四行储蓄会福源钱庄等为收款机关并组设经济委员会负责,曾于八月二十日及九月二十日登报公告收到救济金数目,但商务捐款,并不在内,综合上开六项观察,则事己显然,惟行白等祇负调查责任,未容有所论列,故本述而不不断之意,综叙事实如何之处,仍祈钧会鉴核办理,　呈巿执行委员会,监察委员会常务委员童行白,执行委员陈克,成</p>
<p>The Six Districts Party Department 向向 Central Committee 呈控 member后大椿 of 背誓诈财触犯刑章,堕损党誉 one case, 奉钧会临时紧急会议决议,promote行白克成·查明见复etc. Based on this, the Municipal Party Department immediately worked with the General Affairs Office of the Commercial Press and Mr. Wang Yunwu, the manager of the Press, to inquire about the situation of the donation. Subsequently, they went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and talked with Zhao Shusheng, the secretary of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, to inquire whether there were any records of previous donations. Subsequently, they also spoke with Chen Ji, the former cadre of the Procuratorate of the Association, who managed the accounts of the department, to inquire whether the donations were entered into the accounts and used, and consulted a copy of the meeting records and two copies of the accounts, as detailed in the audit. The important points obtained in this case are listed below: (1) The process of donation (1) On July 17, the Anti-Japanese Relief Association proposed how to assist the distressed overseas Chinese and decided (C) that the committee members present would automatically raise funds. (See the meeting records of the Anti-Japanese Relief Association) (2) On July 18-19 (according to Wang Yunwu, about four or five days before the withdrawal of the funds), Hou Dachun persuaded Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press to donate funds to relieve overseas Chinese. Wang replied that the museum could temporarily donate 500 yuan to help overseas Chinese in need. (According to Wang Yunwu) (3) On July 23, Hou sent Wang Yongliang to Wang Yunwu with a letter (see below and attached a temporary receipt) to receive 500 yuan of overseas Chinese relief funds. (According to Wang Yunwu) (4) On the morning of October 20, Hou held 500 yuan and returned it to Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press, asking to take back the temporary receipt. (According to Wang Yunwu and see Hou's report) (2) The nature of the donation. After checking, Committee Member Wang Yansong explained at the temporary meeting of the Executive Committee that if it was relief money, it could not be used at all. The committee members present also insisted that the nature of the donation and whether it was transferred must be investigated. When he went to Wang Yunwu's place, he said that the donation company trusted the Anti-Japanese Relief Association at that time, and did not pay attention to the purpose of the donation. When filling in the payment voucher, it was based on Hou Jun's letter saying "Relief Fund for Overseas Chinese in Korea." The letter from Hou Dachun to the museum stated "I am very grateful for your promise to donate 500 yuan for overseas Chinese relief." It was also found that the payment voucher of the museum stated "Relief Fund for Overseas Chinese in Korea", and the letter from the museum to the Sixth District Party Department also stated "Relief Fund for Overseas Chinese". The nature of the donation has been shown in the text by both the pledgers and the fundraisers. (Attached are Hou and the Commercial Press's letters) (1) Hou's letter to Wang Yunwu: Mr. Yunwu, I am very grateful for your promise to "donate 500 yuan for overseas Chinese relief." I am sending Comrade Wang Yongliang to take care of you. Please give it to him. After the official receipt is printed, you can replace it. I wish you a good night, Hou Dachun, July 23. (2) The Commercial Press's reply to the Sixth District: Dear Sir, I have received your letter today. After checking, the Anti-Japanese Relief Association previously raised "500 yuan of overseas Chinese relief funds" from our museum, which was paid out by Hou Dachun on July 23. According to Hou Jun, the association was reorganized and the funds were not used. They were returned in full this morning. I am replying to your inquiry. The Commercial Press, Executive Committee of the Sixth District Party Department, October 20th. (3) The basis for fundraising. After checking, Committee Member Hou Dachun published a statement in the newspaper, "At the beginning of the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Relief Association, it was decided that the committee members should raise donations. Dachun, as one of the committee members, has the obligation to persuade donations. He raised 500 yuan from Mr. Wang Yunwu, the manager of the Commercial Press, and reported to the standing committee members Wang Xiaozhou, Wang Yansong, and Lu Jingshi." There are two points in the above statement: (1) The donation is based on the resolution. (2) The donation has been reported to the standing committee members. Regarding the second point, the three committee members Wang Yansong, Tao Baichuan, and Lu Jingshi have proved in the report of the temporary meeting of the Executive Committee that they did hear it, but Hou Jun did not mention when it was received and how it was used. Regarding the first point, there are also two records in the meeting records of the Anti-Japanese Relief Committee: (1) Fifth article of the first meeting at 2:00 pm on July 17, how to assist the distressed overseas Chinese (A) Send telegrams to domestic and foreign donations to specify the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai China, Transportation, Xingye, Central, and other six banks, four savings associations, and Fuyuan Qianzhuang as collection agencies (B) Send a letter to the National Government to allocate 1 million yuan to send personnel to rescue (C) Each committee member present will automatically raise funds (2) Continue to hold the second meeting at 1:00 pm on July 23 (Article 2, how should the association raise funds? Resolved to borrow 50,000 yuan from the Municipal Party Department, and recommend Wang Yansong, Tao Baichuan, and Hou Dachun to contact the Municipal Party Department. The above two records (1) are for those who donate to relieve overseas Chinese, each committee member should automatically raise funds according to the items, (2) Those who raise funds are members Wang, Tao, and Hou, to borrow from the Municipal Party Department. There are no other resolutions that can be investigated. It can be seen that Committee Member Hou's fundraising must be based on the previous resolution of relief funds. (4) Report of the donation According to Committee Member Hou's statement in the newspaper, he once reported to the standing committee members Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Lu Jingshi, having raised 500 yuan from Wang Yunwu." After pressing for inspection, there is no record of this donation in all the records of the association. However, according to Committee Member Wang Yansong's report at the first temporary meeting of the Municipal Executive Committee, Dachun, after raising 500 yuan from Wang Yunwu, once told me and expressed his joy. At that time, because the official receipt had not been issued, he wanted to issue a temporary receipt. At that time, I did not agree, but the funds should not be used at all. There is a motion to check (see record). He also said, "Now I know that Dachun has returned the funds to the Commercial Press. This is a mistake" (see record). According to Committee Member Lu Jingshi's report, "Comrade Hou Dachun once told me in a private conversation about raising 500 yuan from the Commercial Press, but I don't know what kind of nature, what kind of purpose, and when it was received." It can be seen that it is indeed a fact that the donation was said to people, but it was a private conversation, not a report in a formal meeting, so there is no document to check in the meeting. 5) Transfer of donations. According to Committee Member Hou, this 500 yuan of overseas Chinese relief funds from the Commercial Press, Dachun was the director of the Procuratorate at the time. Feeling that the association's economy was tight and the work was difficult, he discussed with other standing committee members and agreed to call this money first and transfer it after the official receipt was printed. After checking, this relief fund was used for the association's use. According to Zhao Shusheng, the secretary of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, there was no formal document to notify the secretariat and the accounting department, so there is no way to check the transfer case. Also, after checking the collection temporary notebook of the Procuratorate, it can be seen that "Director Hou" received 500 yuan on July 24, and "Director Hou" received 50 yuan on August 6, totaling 550 yuan. And on August 8 (after the Anti-Japanese Association's accounting department allocated 2,000 yuan to repay the advance payment, it was recorded "Repay the Municipal Assembly 460 yuan. If Director Hou's advance payment of 550 yuan is repaid, there is still an advance payment of 990 yuan that has not been listed in the account. It is impossible to check who paid it." On October 4, there was a summary "A total of 12,201 yuan, 3 corners and 5 cents were received", of which 550 yuan should be deducted to repay "Director Hou". According to Committee Member Hou and Chen Ji, the cadre who managed the accounts of the department, 500 yuan of the previous 550 yuan of Director Hou was the loss fund of the Commercial Press, but there was no written indication, and it was impossible to obtain evidence. And why the donation of the Commercial Press became Director Hou's private fund is also a question. After checking the accounts of the侦察 department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association (established on September 22), on September 20, 262 yuan, 2 corners and 3 points and 5 li of donations from Hou's hand were received. On October 4, the accounting office allocated 237 yuan, 7 corners and 6 points and 5 li of commercial donations from Hou's hand. On October 20, 500 yuan of Hou's donation of commercial funds were paid back. The word 商捐 on the account is seen in the accounts of the侦察 department after the reorganization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It is not in the era when Committee Member Hou was兼 任 Director of the Procuratorate in the Anti-Japanese Relief Association. Although the ledger was used for one month, it was quite clean, but the dates contained in it were slightly reversed and smeared. (6) Evidence of Donation According to Committee Member Hou in his presentation to the Central Committee, "At that time, the official evidence of the overseas Chinese relief fund had not been printed, and all the work in the meeting required funds to proceed. Therefore, it was suspected that the fundraising money would be collected and transferred first, and the meeting would issue a temporary receipt to avoid increasing procedures." There is no formal document in the meeting to prove this point, but Mr. Wang Yansong has admitted that he had said this to him at that time. Also, Hou said in his presentation to the Central Committee, "It was originally planned to propose and transfer this money after the official receipt of the meeting was printed, but Chairman Yu Qiaqing of the Anti-Japanese Association did not stamp the official fundraising receipt and could not use it." According to Mr. Tao Baichuan, the standing committee member of the association, after the official receipt of the meeting was printed, each committee member had盖章, but Mr. Yu Qiaqing did not want to stamp it because he did not agree to transfer the relief fund to the meeting's expenses, so it has not been used so far. Also, after checking, the relief fund designated the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai China Communications, Xingye Central and other banks and 四行储蓄福源銭荘 as collection agencies at the first meeting on July 17</p>

<h3>My Views on the Confiscation and Disposal of Enemy Goods and Cloth Seized by the Anti-Japanese Association Qiurizi</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association seized enemy goods and cloth transported by unscrupulous merchants. There is no appropriate method for disposal after confiscation. In the eyes of the people, many people think it is beautiful to wear foreign goods and old-fashioned to use domestic goods. With this in mind, the sales of foreign goods are booming, while domestic goods are destined to be eliminated. Now, it is appropriate to choose those that are not easy to identify and distribute them to disaster victims, accounting for them as account items, and those that are easier to identify and more luxurious, such as silk fabrics, should be distributed to prisons for use as prisoners' uniforms. In this way, people in society will see that this type of fabric is worn by those in distress, and they will naturally choose other fabrics in the future. This is also a method of resisting enemy goods. I wonder what my compatriots think.</p>

<p>Incoming Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper:</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper that Tang Baoshu and others won the first prize in the charity champagne, which is completely inconsistent with the facts and is very surprising. It has been found that there were five winners of the champagne first prize, which was handled by Mr. Xu. Yesterday, Mr. Xu invited the winners to donate 50,000 yuan to help the flood victims and entrusted me to send the funds to Mr. Xu Jingren of the Emergency Relief Association. It was not me who won the first prize, nor did I occupy a share. It has nothing to do with me. Please correct the facts to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. This is very important. I pay my respects and wish you peace.</p>
<p>Tang Baoshu</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper yesterday that "The three district party headquarters of the city, 2, 4, and 7, jointly sent a telegram." After investigation, our district party headquarters did not issue such a telegram. I hereby inform you of the statement.

<h3>90 Minutes of Thrills: Donghua Remains Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>Zero to Zero Draw with Northern Brigade</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Shows Great Ability</p>
<p>-One Scene from the Scoto Cup Preliminary Round-</p>
<p>The Donghua football team met the British Northern Brigade again yesterday at the China Baseball Field, in the first week of the Scoto Cup. As a result of the 90-minute battle, neither side scored and a draw was made, to be replayed on another day. Donghua was under intense pressure throughout the game, but Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and others, with their great spirit, insisted on resisting, achieving a safe draw. The referee was Li Nuosi.</p>
<h3>The Surprise of 10,000 People</h3>
<p>The baseball field was full yesterday, with more than 10,000 people, a new record for the season. Seeing Donghua's danger, people couldn't help but exclaim in alarm. There were three times when they shouted "Oh, oh, oh" in unison, which shows the scene at that time. Helping Donghua's attack was also met with thunderous cheers.</p>
<h3>Donghua Team Lineup</h3>
<p>Chen Pu, Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Li Ning, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Tu Kaiyuan, Dai Linjing</p>
<p>Guan Xunan, Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Yutian</p>
<h3>Northern Brigade Lineup</h3>
<p>Earp, Haili Sheng</p>
<p>Qi Shi Huo, Xue Te'er</p>
<p>Luo Lan, Bao Man, Fa Wei</p>
<p>Luo Shi Mei, Mai Di Xun</p>
<p>Mian En, Yang Ge</p>
<h3>The Origin of Zero to Zero</h3>
<p>After a 90-minute battle, both sides failed to score, which can be described as a meeting of equals. The reason for this is that, although the Northern Brigade launched a fierce attack, they were too hasty and their shots were inaccurate, missing many opportunities. Donghua, on the other hand, Zhou's iron gate doubled his efforts, and Li Ning sat in the back, so the Northern Brigade sighed at the door. Donghua was busy defending, and sometimes attacking, but the forwards lacked cooperation and were a little slow, so they also returned empty-handed, resulting in a score of 0-0.</p>
<h3>Donghua Team Yesterday</h3>
<p>In yesterday's battle, the Donghua team's defense was heavily loaded. Li Ning calmly rescued the danger countless times. Tu Kaiyuan was mediocre and nothing was seen. Zhen Pu sometimes lost the ball, Jia Qiu was satisfied. The forwards were the most disappointing. Dai Jinglin and Chen Hongguang did not develop. Li Yichen was even worse. Qian Jingyong felt a lack of experience and courage, and he did not dare to attack when he reached the door, so he was blocked by the enemy a lot. But the landing point was very good, and there is great hope for the future. In short, yesterday's cooperation was very poor, so the ball was on the feet of the British army. There is also a most important point: the middle defense line was busy taking care of the enemy, so they could not supply the forwards, and the attack power was greatly reduced. This was also due to the enemy's too strong attack power.</p>
<h3>The Two Most Terrible Feet</h3>
<p>The British army's defense line has greatly improved, and it is not possible to see the loss of feet. What is even more frightening is that when the ball was in front of the Northern Brigade's goal, it flew over the middle line with one foot of the defender, and the central defender added one foot to reach the front of Donghua's goal, with the general idea of ​​two feet to control Donghua's life. The hardness of the feet is rare for a while. Unfortunately, the shooting accuracy was lost. Donghua must pass through several passes and desperately run to reach the enemy's goal. Once it is blocked, all the credit is lost. In terms of strength, the British army is stronger.</p>
<h3>Zhou's Iron Gate Shows Supernatural Power</h3>
<p>After the Northern Brigade kicked off, Donghua saw danger within ten minutes. Once the attack failed, the Northern Brigade launched a fierce counterattack. Xue Teer went straight in, and Guan Xun'an saved the corner kick, and fortunately, there was no problem. Bao Man sent a ball from afar, Li Ning jumped up and headed it, Bao Man caught up and sent it, Xue Teer kicked into the net with all his strength, Zhou Xianyan was quick and quick, he swooped down and fell to the ground, and shot it out obliquely, the ball slammed out, and the danger was like this. Later, Bao Man sent the ball to Haili Sheng, Zhou Xianyan saw that the situation was not good and he had already run out, and Xue Teer's kick did not enter the door, and everyone applauded. The dangerous balls in the first half were endless. At the beginning of the second half, Donghua's shape gradually improved, and they attacked several times, and the situation was very smooth. Gradually, the Northern Brigade came again. Dai's center forward intercepted a ball once, and suddenly selected the left corner, Qian Jingyong hooked inward, five tigers advanced together, Chen Yutian added a foot, and the group besieged the Northern Brigade's gate two or three feet in front of the line, and when it was sent in, the goalkeeper of the Northern Brigade was injured and fell to the ground, and pushed the ball, and the whistle was blown and dispersed. Later, although the British army attacked again, Zhou Xianyan saw the danger of the situation, and was more careful and not chaotic, and finally reached a draw.</p>

<h3>Another Strong Football Enemy, Weidexia, to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>-British Army Defense-</p>
<p>Arriving Here from London on the 16th</p>
<p>Northern Brigade Leaves Shanghai on the 22nd</p>
<p>I remember two years ago, when the British Army Weidexia football team defeated Lehua 1-0 at Shenyuan, they were called the heroes of Shanghai and were invincible. Now there is another Weidexia British Army, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. They belong to the same army, but not the same regiment. Their football team is also unstoppable. The current Northern Brigade will leave Shanghai on the 22nd. Weidexia will fill their vacancy, and another strong enemy will come to the maritime football world.</p>

<p>Parting ways. The Ning and Yue sides, who almost fought within the walls, are now, because the Japanese invaders have invaded the country, and the national situation is in danger, each has sent representatives to negotiate peace and unity. During this period, the people of the whole country, who is not holding twelve points of enthusiasm, hoping to achieve peace and unity as soon as possible. Consistently engaged in resisting the violent sun. However, since the two sides met, the progress has been very slow. Especially the location of the peace talks. In Beijing and in Shanghai. Each insists on a view. Although both sides have their own difficulties. When the country is in trouble, it is a matter of life and death. Everyone should resolve their opinions. Open and honest is to save the country in Beijing. It is also to save the country in Shanghai. Why bother to persist. Some people say. The two sides are arguing over the location. Perhaps it will eventually break down. This makes people feel so cold. I hope this statement is not true. And unite the spirit as soon as possible. Common to the outside world. That is the blessing of China.</p>
<p>If the Grass in the Courtyard is Not Removed, Qi Fu Talks About Hui</p>
<h3>Turning Magnetism into Electricity</h3>
<p>After reading Faraday's story, we can't help but ask, "How did he invent his generator?"</p>
<p>In 1820, Faraday's teacher, Davy, passed an electric current around a soft iron, and turned it into a magnet. In 1822, Faraday wrote in his notebook:</p>
<p>"I should turn magnetism into electricity."</p>
<p>The generator was created from such a determination. Since Davy could turn electricity into magnetism, how could I not turn magnetism into electricity? This became Faraday's ambition in the future.</p>
<p>On October 17, 1831, he accidentally obtained a root magnet that was three-quarters of an inch in diameter and eight and a half inches long. He used 22 zhang of copper wire to form a cylinder. He connected a current needle to this copper wire. He put one end of the magnet close to the copper wire, and the current needle was not affected at all, and the needle did not move at all. He suddenly inserted the magnet into the cylinder wrapped with copper wire. The needle turned immediately. He suddenly pulled out the magnet again, and the needle turned again. This is the epoch-making invention of InducedCurrent. When a conductor moves and can intersect the magnetic force line, an induced current is generated. The mystery in this is the movement intersection. If the conductor does not move, that is, if it moves but does not intersect the magnetism, no current can be generated.</p>
<p>From then on, Faraday created his machine based on this principle. He placed the edge of a round copper disk between the two poles of a horseshoe magnet, used copper sheets and aluminum sheets to make contact with the edge of the disk, and connected the ammeter. As soon as the copper disk rotated, the current passed. This is a small generator. This small generator is the source of modern electrical civilization.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Urgently Establishing a Fine Yarn Factory Amidst the Anti-Japanese Voice</h3>
<p>— Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>Originally, economic severance with Japan is a method that our people have to implement. Trying to view the overlapping of their country's battleships to demonstrate, we can also see that this matter must be effective for a long time. However, since the boycott until now, it has only been more than two months, and the number of our country's domestic goods factories that have been heard to close down has been numerous. The factory owners have suffered huge losses suddenly, and the workers are also at risk of unemployment. Then, the result of the boycott, isn't it similar to suicide? What is more foolish than this in the world? I have tried to study its cause, and then I realized where the knot lies. Almost all of our country's factories (especially the knitting industry) rely on the raw materials produced by the other party on weekdays. Now, unfortunately, the source has been cut off, and they have no way to do anything. It shows that it is impossible to rely on the business of relying on others in the end. Therefore, for the sake of punishing the past and preventing the future, we have to make the following suggestions. (A) Organizational methods Clothing is a daily necessity for our people, so the raw material for the knitting industry—"fine yarn"—should be resolved urgently. I think this matter should be jointly initiated by the industry and quickly organized to establish a large-scale fine yarn factory, which should be named "Shanghai Knitting Industry Fine Yarn Manufacturing Factory."</p>
<h3>Looking Northeast</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Amidst these cries of national crisis, there are still calls for "peace" that can be heard within our borders, even as we lack the time to save ourselves from foreign aggression. Alas, it truly makes one want to cry, but no tears come. I recall that a certain important figure had the slogan "Walk to the Left." I now replace it with the four characters "Look to the Northeast." Perhaps if they were to read this, it would stir them to action.</p>
<p>Damn it! Our eastern neighbor's son is running rampant, devoid of humanity. He has invaded my Liaoning and Jilin provinces as if entering a small castle. Having seized these strategic points, he then robs us of our wealth and treasures. He rapes and pillages, showing no regard for young or old. He lets his military might run wild, killing as if they were mere grass. The blood and marrow stain the wilderness. Corpses and bones are left as feed for crows. Pitiable are those who survive the plunder, their cries filled with sorrow, their forms withered. They emerge alone from the tiger's den, barely managing to preserve their lives. But then they encounter bandit brigands who sweep through the trains like a whirlwind of robbery. Alas, those who suffer disaster, women, children, even infants in swaddling clothes. At this time of year, when the days grow cold, they are left without clothing or food. If one has a heart of compassion, their suffering should be held close to the heart. Moreover, one should remember that the nation faces difficult times. Both sides should strive for peace. Our people are content with temporary security, and they call for peace early on. Why wait until today to continue to debate? National crisis is already upon us. We cannot afford mutual jealousy and abandonment. We must be of one mind against external threats. The wisdom of the sages can be consulted. Internal strife is no different from fighting over grain. Losing the Great Wall to foreign aggression leaves us with only sorrow and regret. We must know that the Japanese barbarians are taking advantage of our floods and droughts. If we do not repent, the danger will be difficult to avert. When will these small-minded, ambitious people be defeated? Now is the time for deep self-reflection. Let us offer prayers from the depths of our hearts. The wise will surely defend our country and extinguish this group of demons. Then we can face the people and not fear the island of Fusang. Heroes are not born of a particular lineage. Success or failure lies in the hands of Heaven. If we can win a single battle, the mountains and rivers will be transformed. Otherwise, if we continue to fight each other, we will ultimately become slaves. The thought of national destruction is terrifying. My heart is truly troubled. Let us ask, who is to blame? I will be the first to speak. For thousands of years, for ten thousand generations, the crime will never be washed away. Alas, our leaders, why not repent as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Internally, management must be strict, and all equipment must apply the latest scientific methods, so that costs are saved and great efficiency is achieved, so that development in the future can be predicted.</p>
<p>(B) Fundraising This factory was initiated by the industry, and the capital should be evenly distributed. Suppose there are about 3,000 large and small companies in the city, and each company is assigned an average of 2,000 yuan, then the total amount will be 6 million yuan. Half of this amount is used to purchase various machinery and raw materials and hire technicians. The rest should be deposited in the bank for safekeeping and interest, for the need for gradual development in the future.</p>
<p>(C) Product types Regarding product types, for the purpose of resisting Japanese goods and supplying spot sales, 42-count and 60-count fine yarns are currently used as the standard. In the future, if the management is effective, we should gradually seek to expand. In addition to self-sufficiency, we must strive for external development. The staff serving in the factory should also keep in mind the importance of the mission they bear and should be vigilant at all times. . Study and make progress. In this way, the future of domestic products will be better.</p>
<p>The above is just to talk about its main points. As for detailed planning, it remains to be discussed. "A good opportunity comes once in a thousand years, and it will pass quickly." I don't know if the patriotic knitwear industry gentlemen have any interest in this?</p>
<h3>Late Autumn Talks of Baimen</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>Do not worry about the late lotus. Mochou Lake is located outside the Sanshan Gate in the capital. It is the best place to escape the summer heat. To the right of the lake is the Martyrs' Shrine. There is the Huayan Nunnery on the lakeside. Inside is the Yu Jin Hall. Shengqi Tower and other famous places. Lotus flowers are planted throughout the lake. When the lotus flowers bloom, women from the city come to visit. The shadows of their hair, the fragrance of flowers, the lake and mountains add to the charm. Until the early autumn, the fragrant lotus flowers produced in the lake are particularly famous. Now, because autumn is deep and people are thin, the remaining lotus flowers on the lake have long been removed. However, because the owner is elegant, one or two late-blooming lotus flowers remain. These few lotus leaves still stand slanting in the water. Unfortunately, because the delicate body is weak, it cannot withstand the waves and wind. Shaking. Almost what is said to keep the residual lotus to listen to the sound of rain.</p>
<p>Jiming Red Leaves Jiming Temple. (on the mountain) is located to the right of the Drum Tower and west of the Examination Institute. The temple has the Huomeng Tower. Overlooking Xuanwu Lake. Everything is in sight. There are the ruins of Taicheng at the northern foot of the mountain. Next to the temple is also the Rouge Well. The railing of the well has decayed. It is said that if you wipe it with silk, the color is like rouge. It is uncertain whether it is true. There is also a pavilion on the side. The shape is exquisite. A colored dragon is painted in the pavilion. With fangs and claws. Vivid and magical. Extremely ingenious. Recently, because the frost and dew have just cleared, the crabs are fat and the chrysanthemums are beautiful. The mountains are full of red leaves. Reflecting into the eyes. Greatly helps tourists to be clear.</p>
<p>Fat Sheep Loves People Mutton is warm in nature. It is one of the winter tonics. Many southerners love this. However, their cooking is not as good as that of the northerners. Huzhou is rich in silk. The sheep raised under its mulberry trees are also quite famous. Its fat and thick meat is still not as good as the sheep in the north. Recently, the scientific wind has been bleak. A lot of fat sheep have already been put on the market in the capital. We often pass by the west street of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Talking About Green Gas Cannons and Their Prevention Methods (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yubo</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Shen Bao newspaper reported that the Japanese army in Dong Province had transported many poisonous gas cannons. The people of the country, in view of the cruelty of the violent Japanese and their inhumane behavior, various violations of international conventions, and the use of aircraft bombs to bombard undefended Chinese cities, etc., infer that it is difficult to guarantee that the Japanese army will not violate Article 23 of Chapter 1 of the Hague Convention. (This article prohibits the use of poisonous gas that causes death as a weapon.) At this time when people are in panic, those of us who know a little bit cannot have a few words to provide to our dear compatriots for advance preparation and subsequent reference.</p>
<p>Our country knew about the so-called green gas cannon decades ago. Therefore, to this day, any poisonous gas is called a green gas cannon. This common name is considered wrong and also considered correct. Why? It turns out that green gas is only one of fifty or sixty kinds of poisonous gases, and the release of poisonous gas is not limited to a large weapon such as a field gun. In particular, the release of green gas is done by cloud-like emission, that is, the gas is stored in a cylinder and spread downwind. Therefore, the name green gas cannon is wrong. However, in the European War, although the types of poisonous gases were invented day by day, and their toxicity was ten or a hundred times that of green gas, there were more than dozens of them. However, in terms of actual use, because green gas is easier to manufacture and has a higher output, and its implementation is a little more convenient, it is easier to supply than other expensive and difficult-to-manufacture poisonous gases. Therefore, compared to other types, green gas is still used the most on the battlefield. (About 20,000 tons were used in the European War, followed by phosgene with about 15,000 tons. The third was the king of poisonous gas, mustard gas, with 11,000 tons.) The cylinders and cannons used for release are similar in shape. Therefore, we can generally call it a green gas cannon. It can also be considered correct. If we want to defend against this poisonous gas, we must first understand the names and types of various poisonous gases. However, this cannot be explained in a short space. Generally speaking, poisonous gas is divided into four types. One type is lethal. For example, green gas, phosgene (also known as phosgene), etc. The second type is lacrimatory. As long as a very small amount is mixed in the air (for example, a ratio of one in ten million), it can make people tear up. A little thicker can make people feel eye pain, vomiting, shortness of breath, or even death. This poisonous agent is mainly composed of bromine and combined with other substances. The third type is sneezing gas. It is mainly composed of arsenic. A small amount mixed in the air will cause people to sneeze and vomit. This poisonous gas was first invented after the European War. Because this arsenic compound is mostly in the form of extremely fine particles, it cannot be blocked by masks. The fourth type is called blistering or erosive gas. If we apply a small drop to our fingers or toes, just the size of a needle tip, it can kill us. This is the king of poisonous gas, mustard gas. The methods of emitting poisonous gas are: using cannons to load poisonous gas into shells, or using airplanes to load poisonous gas into oil tanks and fly into the air to spread it, or releasing it by the wind. As for hand grenades and large bombs, they can all be filled with poisonous gas. And it does not have to rely on the wind to be released into the enemy's formation. Whenever there is suspicion, we suddenly smell a special smell. (Mustard smell, rotten smell, pungent smell, fertilizer smell) At the same time, someone has tearing, sneezing or eye pain, etc., knowing that the enemy has released poisonous gas.</p>
<p>I often smell the mutton fragrance of "Deyi Lou" and other mutton restaurants (opened by northerners). It really makes people drool.</p>
<p>Short message "Tanaka Cabinet's Aggressive Policy Proposal for Manchuria and Mongolia." It is a great revelation of the Japanese people's ambition to invade China. This book was previously printed and given to all walks of life by the Xinsheng News Agency. In less than ten days, it was all taken away. Most citizens have not yet seen it. The China Chemical Industry Society on Henan Road, Shanghai, in view of the fact that this book is of great importance to the survival of our country's territory, specially funded the printing of 20,000 copies for distribution to the people of the country to jointly rise up and become aware to face the national crisis. Those who want it can go to the local area to ask for it. Foreigners can attach a one-cent stamp and it will be sent by mail.</p>

<h3>Country Folks Arrive in Shanghai Again (3)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country man thought...it turned out that he could tell from my appearance that I didn't look like someone who would ride in first or second class. Their eyes are really sharp.</p>
<p>"Then where did you buy the third-class ticket?" The policeman gradually became a little more gentle. "Didn't you see that the tickets are all different colors...third-class tickets are blue, second-class tickets are white, and first-class tickets are red, that's clear."</p>
<p>The country man had indeed never ridden in first or second class before. Now, thanks to the policeman's guidance, he gained a little knowledge. After buying his own ticket, he hid over there to watch other people buy tickets. Sure enough, some people bought white tickets, and some people bought red tickets. But after watching for a while, he saw someone buying a ticket that was white on both sides, but red in the middle. He became confused. Was this a first-class ticket or a second-class ticket?</p>
<p>He wanted to ask the man in the yellow uniform, but the man in the yellow uniform lazily walked away. He really wanted to clear up this confusion, so he followed the person who bought the red and white ticket and asked...</p>
<p>"Friend, what kind of ticket did you buy?"</p>
<p>"A platform ticket. What do you care?" The person was very surprised that the country man was asking him. He was probably there to see off a friend and walked away in a hurry.</p>
<p>But the country man still didn't understand.</p>
<p>"What's called a platform ticket?" He wondered to himself... "Could it be that there's a place on the train to watch the moon? Is there a rooftop garden?"</p>
<p>Then he suddenly realized... "That's right, that's right. Didn't I see many people standing between the first-class and second-class cars when I came back from Shanghai last time? First-class is a red ticket, and second-class is a white ticket. They're between first and second class, so that ticket is also red and white. This place must be the platform, right?"</p>
<p>He explained this question to himself, and his heart suddenly felt relieved. Walking out of the iron gate, he saw many people standing there.</p>
<p>But he saw a person dressed very specially. In this hot weather, he was wearing a gray cloth suit, and he was also carrying a leather belt diagonally across his back. But he wasn't carrying anything with it. What was the use of this leather belt? It wasn't raining. He was wearing those leather boots that looked like leggings, which were airtight. He really wasn't afraid of the heat. There were also copper rings on the leather belt. It was convenient for hanging dry tobacco pouches, keys, fan pouches, etc. The strangest thing was that he was still wearing gloves in this hot weather. The row of bubble-headed nails on the collar seemed to have been peeled off from someone's shikumen.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Still Soft</h3>
<p>Seven twists and turns, yesterday, the 31st, the gold standard still potentially weakened, with slight fluctuations. From morning to noon, a total of seven taels were reviewed, and in the end, it was reduced by one tael. Only the industry trend was still stable, selling and then buying again. It is expected that the silver market will continue to rise and the German rush to make silver coins may be implemented. The market opened low, once breaking into 690 taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate was wide externally and stable internally, and the bank's buying intention was unabated. Then the gold price recovered to stability, but there were two or three tael trades in between. Finally, the market closed at around 695 taels. Because it was Saturday, there was no market. It was also found that the trend weakened this week, from over 710 taels to within 700 taels. There was a review of 27 taels, and the overall decline was more than 10 taels.</p>
<p>The opening was down from the beginning. It fell 3 liang and 6 qian to 692.5 taels. The big bar rose again by 16.7%. The silver price rose by 0.75%. People's hearts were slightly soft. Then there were 2 liang up and down, from 93 liang and 3 qian back to 1 liang and 2 qian. Yuan Sheng and others came to buy, adding to 93 liang and 5 qian. Suddenly, Yuan Mao, Yong Da, Dacheng, Fuchang, Neixing, Yifeng and others sold out, and the exchange market loosened. The US dollar bank initially entered 32.6875 yuan in January, and then issued 5625 to half a yuan in the near future. Therefore, the market situation was quite weak, and it actually broke into 90 liang, suddenly to 88 liang and 5 qian. After 9:10, foreign companies settled their accounts, with British gold at 18.125. Yuda, Fuyu, Qianchang, Xiangteng, and Yongdeng came to buy, and when British gold opened, it was about 94 liang, followed by 4 liang and 4 qian. Although the list was 375 long, the US dollar was only 375, so it was not moved. Then, because Hengxing, Wanxing and others sold out, it fell back to 92.5 taels. At that time, HSBC and others absorbed 11 yuan in November, which was sold by Sumitomo. Mitsui issued 275 in December, and also did 125 British gold in February with Huabi. On the trading floor, the buyers were active, and Yuan Mao, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Qianchang, Xiangheng, Yu and others competed to enter, so the price rose by 3 taels. At 10:15, it was 95 liang and 4 qian. After entering, the recent British gold can be settled at 18.375. The gold market seemed to see the downstream. From 10:15 to 11:00, there was a rotation of more than 1 liang. Hengxing still had sales, but the Dalian gang entered. However, people's hearts were uncertain, and then it fell to 92 liang. Suddenly, Fuyu Shunli came in, and Shanghai ate 125 British gold in February. Huabi ate 4375 US dollars, to 11:30, it was 4 liang and 8 qian, but retail investors sold a little. After ten minutes, it fell back to 2.5 liang. After 11:30, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Tong Taichang had a strong buying intention, and the short sellers also made up their positions, so the exchange rate also became stable. Therefore, the noon closing was 94 liang and 7 qian, which was still 1 liang lower than the day before yesterday. The quadruple lifted to about 5 liang. According to the largest 95 liang and 4 qian during the half day, the smallest was 88 liang and 5 qian, with a difference of 6 liang and 9 qian. The early market closing was 2 liang and 8 qian, and the noon closing was 5 liang. The quotation was changed to 759 taels, which was 65 taels to 64.5 taels. The account was supplemented with 95 taels of red tape. A total of 8 liang and 56 qian were added.</p>
<p>Trading was flat on the trading floor. According to statistics, Tong Taichang, Qian Changxiang, Fuyu, Yongzhi, Yu Da, Futai Heng, Yuansheng, etc. all entered. Shunli, Bingxing, Hengxing, Yifeng, Wanxing, Da Decheng, Yuan Xingyong all exited. Yuan Maoyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, etc. exited and then entered. Yuanshenglong, Yifeng Yong, Dakang, Heng Changyong Huiyuan, Yuanmao, etc. suddenly entered and exited. Those who made hedging US dollars entered. The Guangdong gang exited a total of 1,4500 bars, still short. The Dalian gang entered a total of more than 1,000 bars and exited a total of more than 1,500 bars.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Market is Clearly Wide and Secretly Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian and silver markets all rose again, the European market was still flat, and the exchange rate continued to fall. HSBC's listing has increased by 1.5%. British gold is 375, which is 1 shilling, 7 pence and 75 US exchange is slightly longer by 375, which is 31.625 yuan. Hong Kong suddenly dropped by 625, which is 77.25 taels. Indian exchange increased by 2 yuan, German exchange increased by 1 yuan, French franc increased by 13 yuan, and foreign currency increased by 1.5 yuan. Singapore exchange reduced by 3 taels, but the domestic British gold market was loose and turned flat. As a result, the Chinese businessmen slightly longer by 0625. There were not many transactions. Mumbai once called to buy, and foreign companies settled their accounts. The US dollar transaction amounted to 30 to 400,000 yuan. Gold companies still threw out, and HSBC, Mai Hang and other buyers had a good appetite. However, the market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, and finally shrank by 0625 compared to the day before yesterday. It is a clear sign of a tight exchange rate. As for the gold market turning from weak to flat, people's hearts are still good. Later, because it was Saturday, the market was closed.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate in the domestic market had a difference of 25 in half a day. The loosest closing was 1 shilling, 8 pence and 375, and the tightest was 125. The asking price in the early market was about 1875 to 125, and the buying price was 125 to 1875. HSBC made 125 in February (foreign businessmen entered). Afterwards, Mitsui Huabi made 125 in February. HSBC issued 375 in November (Mumbai entered). Shanghai entered 125 in February. The asking price at noon closing was 1875 to 125, and the buying price was 25 to 1875.</p>
<p>The US exchange rate in the domestic market fluctuated by 25. The loosest was 32.5625 yuan, and the tightest was 3225. The asking price in the early market was about 32.5 yuan to 375, and the buying price was increased by 125.

The asking price at noon closing was 3125 to 375, and the buying price was 4375 to half a yuan. The US dollar listing price of half a yuan is equivalent to 3 liang, 1 qian, 6 fen and 205 silver.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Markets See Repeated Increases</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the price of silver rose repeatedly. For example, both near and distant futures rose by 4375 to 17 yuan, 18 yuan and 125. China and India both made purchases. There were few transactions. The market situation was calm after the closing, but there was still an uncertain state. The New York telegram said that the price of silver also rose by 75 to 0.0625 yuan. The British pound dropped by 125 to 3.8625 yuan. The US dollar against the British pound also fell by 2.5% to 3.8475 yuan. The British Shanghai shilling increased by 625 to 1 shilling and 8.5 pence. Mumbai spot increased by 1 rupee and 0.04 anna to 58 rupees. The forward premium also increased by 1 rupee and 0.06 anna to 54 rupees and 14 annas.</p>
<h3>The Only Big Bi Period at the End of October</h3>
<p>Silver Dollar Settlement is Very Complex</p>
<p>Yesterday was the only big bi period at the end of October. The procedures for collecting and settling various silver dollars were special and complicated. It is impossible to make a detailed investigation. Only the prices and transactions in the market are briefly described. The early market foreign cent was 7 qian, 2 fen and 7 li, and the noon market was 7 qian, 2 fen and 7.5 li, which was one li better than the previous day. The silver premium was 1 qian and 4 fen in the early market and 2 qian and 7 fen in the noon market. The bank's listing price was 1 qian, the starting price was 2 qian, 5 fen and 6 qian, and the foreign exchange bills were made. The early market was 2.74 million, the noon market was 1.944 million, the banknotes were 60,000 in the early market and 20,000 in the noon market. The early market for off-site banknotes was 185,000 and the noon market was 105,000. The bank transactions and various collections and settlements of the silver and money industries cannot be explored in detail and are omitted. The early and noon markets for Jiangnan small foreign coins were the same at 6 qian, 5 fen and 4 li. The early market transaction was 3,500 jiao and the noon market was 2,000 jiao. The early market for Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 qian, 5 fen, 0.8 hao and 7 hu. The noon market was 6 qian, 5 fen and 1 li. The early market transaction was 95,000 jiao and the noon market was 55,000 jiao. The copper yuan rose by another 1,000 yuan to 382,000.</p>
<h3>Extraordinarily High Interest Rate Floor</h3>
<p>Due to the tight money supply in October, the daily silver premium was exceptionally high. It was often 34 yuan. Therefore, the total amount of silver premium for the whole month was 9 taels, 8 qian and 1 fen. In addition, the day of the Double Ten Festival was a holiday, and 2 qian and 3 fen should be added. So the total reached 10 taels and 4 fen. The average daily bargaining price was more than 3 qian and 4 li, which is not only the only rare extraordinarily high interest rate this year, but also rare in the past. Generally speaking, the money industry association's regular meeting on interest rates always deducts 95 yuan for the deposit interest rate of 10 liang, and the overdue interest is added as usual. In this way, the highest price of overdue interest must be as high as 16 liang and 5 qian.</p>
<h3>Securities Forward Bonds Have Been Auctioned</h3>
<p>The Market Situation is Unusually Clear and the Opening Price Trend is Stable</p>
<p>The Seller's Current Product Provision Has Been Abolished</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange reopened, and at the same time, the futures trading for December was auctioned, such as 20 customs, 19 customs, good integration, blue tax, etc., which have been opened. The restriction on the seller's current product provision has been abolished, and the fixed rate of security deposit has been changed to 1,400 yuan. Therefore, the arbitrage project can no longer be established on the exchange's account. There was no major rise or fall in price. The big households waited and watched as before, and the transaction was lower than before the delivery. Although many forward futures were opened, they were all scattered transactions. The opening was 4.7 million yuan in the morning and only more than 1.7 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 6.465 million. The trend of bonds can be expected to be slightly stronger than before. However, the current situation is slightly worse than before, so the big households are waiting and watching. The market situation is quiet. Not only did the sellers not sell out huge amounts, but the buyers felt even more indifferent. As a result, the supply and demand situation was very flat. The market prices of various bonds did not rise or fall significantly. Although they generally continued to fall compared to before the delivery, the number was very small. The depression was unprecedented in recent times.</p>

<h3>Dull Colors in Gauze and Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Although the yarn market is stable, actual sales are more active due to procurement from Tianjin and other provinces.  There are also rumors of factory shutdowns in Japan, leading to a slight improvement in market sentiment. However, funds are still difficult to loosen, and national affairs remain unstable.  Most people dare not operate their businesses with peace of mind, resulting in an extremely scattered market situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Exchange Weak, with a Slight Decline The market opened with American cotton prices flat and gold prices falling, leading to a cool atmosphere.  Prices for all months fell by 0.03 to 0.06 taels. The afternoon saw prices flat, with a decline of 0.01 taels for all months. Total daily transaction volume was 13,100 bales.  Rongxing sold 950 bales, Ruidai 550 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, and Hou Shenda 850 bales. Yicheng bought 1,050 bales, Dachang 700 bales, and Yilong 450 bales.  The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Exchange Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest January: 160.3, down 0.09 taels, 5,000 bales.</p>
<p>November 11: 160.1, down 0.04 taels, 65,600 bales. February: 160.5, 0 taels, 82,200 bales.</p>
<p>December: 160.5, 0 taels, 39,400 bales. March: 160.4, 0 taels, 60,650 bales.</p>
<p>Active Yarn Sales Current yarn sales are smooth. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 2,200 bales throughout the day, with 1,700 bales being traded among peers. The market is firm. Among customer groups, 400 bales were from inland Huaian, 65 bales from Jiangxi, 1,100 bales from Tianjin, 60 bales from Sichuan, 330 bales from Shantou, 85 bales from Guangdong, and 50 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is sluggish due to the softening trend of American cotton and the daily increase in silver prices. The weak gold market has made foreign cotton calculations in silver cheaper. Therefore, some manufacturers are buying Indian cotton to hedge against the standard. The situation is slightly sluggish. However, the Hubei group and some bulls, seeing the decline in supply from various sources, are determined to short-squeeze this month and are still firmly intending to buy. However, spot cotton transactions are extremely quiet. Factories have no intention to buy because they are fully stocked with foreign cotton. Therefore, large firms still tend to sell on rises, but a large drop is unlikely at present.</p>
<p>Hubei Cotton Exchange Weak, with a Slight Decline The Hubei Cotton Exchange opened with the American cotton situation flat and gold prices weak, leading to a decline of 0.02 taels for all months. In the afternoon, news of favorable American cotton reports for bulls emerged, and prices rose by 0.005 to 0.02 taels for all months. Total daily transaction volume was 58,800 dan. Dafu sold 8,100 dan, Dafeng 2,800 dan, Dachang 5,900 dan, and Changji 1,400 dan. Yicheng bought 5,700 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>December: 33.25, down 0.005 taels, 24,400 bales. March: 33.15, 0.015 taels, 173,000 bales.</p>

British cotton futures were unchanged, while spot prices rose 2 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by European exporters, Japanese merchants, and brokers. Pingguoer rose 3.25 rupees, Omura rose 2.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (30th telegram):</p>

<h3>Private Estimate of American Cotton</h3>
<p>New York, 30th The Klemens Company's estimate of this year's new cotton crop is 16,170,000 bales, an increase of 262,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (September 29).</p>
<h3>Slightly Up and Down American Cotton Weekly Report</h3>
<p>The Department of Agriculture announced it would accept stored cotton at 8 cents per pound.</p>
<p>The upcoming government report is expected to show a slight increase.</p>
<p>New York, 30th A report on the cotton market situation for the past week: The price of raw cotton fluctuated within a range of 50 points this week. When prices rose, Southern buyers covered their short positions. When prices fell, traders and brokerage firms bought in. This situation shows that the pressure of Southern inventory is still a concern. On the other hand, given the current low cotton prices and the determination of the Southern hoarding movement, there is confidence that cotton prices will rise in the future. The Department of Agriculture recently announced that it would accept stored cotton at a price of 8 cents per pound as collateral for cotton seed loans. It is estimated that these loans will total about 10 million yuan. Continuous rain in the western and central cotton belts has delayed picking, but progress has been reported in the east. The rain has not damaged the cotton lint. Cotton merchants expect the government's cotton production report on November 9 to be the same as or slightly higher than the previous estimate. It is said that some Southern cotton mills are now purchasing forward raw cotton because they can profit from purchasing raw materials at current prices to cope with future disputes.</p>
<p>Another report The hoarding movement has not stopped. Cooperative current purchases seem to supply. Numbers of merchants are willing to handle spot cotton. The weather is suitable. It is estimated that the next Department of Agriculture cotton production report will show an increase. Domestic piece goods trade is slightly less active than before.</p>

<h3>The Market Price of Longan in Shima, North-South Goods, is Upside Down</h3>
<p>The output of Shima Longan this year is poor, and the supply is small. The previous plate 正号码宏 Zeng opened at 41.2 taels, but recently the markets in various places have been sluggish. Although the number of goods arriving one after another is not large, there are few who enter, and the counter-offer is not over 40 taels, so it is again in a state of stagnation.

<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea is in Irreversible Decline</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces, the market of local foreign tea houses has suddenly become sluggish. Recently, although the French houses have sold slightly针眉秀眉 tea, the sale plate has already dropped over 10 taels. The most important Zhenmei green tea market has remained sluggish. The total number of local green teas in this year is only 180,000, a decrease of 80,000 boxes compared to last year, and sales are so sluggish because the future of the tea industry has been considerably affected by the Zhenmei廉价兢銷 of Japan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Promoting National Goods Piece Goods' Rise</h3>
<p>The piece goods industry has been almost entirely occupied by Eastern goods in recent years. Even the products of advanced countries such as Britain and the United States are beyond reach. The foreign goods shops in various cities and towns are no less than showrooms for Eastern goods. The wholesale shops and firms are mostly engaged in Japanese goods, so the value of monthly imports is quite alarming. Since the Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces, the cotton cloth industry has first broken off economic relations and is now completely封存 not importing or selling, which has dealt a major blow to the Japanese. Although trade is sluggish, it is particularly active in promoting national goods. Those with a little capital are planning to set up factories to produce common goods such as satin,呢,细哔叽, and 彩条绒. The output is increasing daily. If they can persist for a year, Eastern goods will have no place. The most difficult fine yarn factory has already 集资倡办 by the Ministry of Industry. Recently, they have ordered a large number of mercerized threads from British and American merchants to prepare to weave satin哔叽 and other products. The establishment of velvet factories is also like mushrooms after rain, so products such as 彩条级,蓝条绒, and 棉法绒 only need to be woven into cloth坯, plus the products of Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company 逹丰丰鸿章 and other factories, which are also increasing daily. In the future, there will be no need for Japanese supply.</p>
