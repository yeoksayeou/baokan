<p>自來政局不安定之國。其顯著之現象每以政見與黨爭。　辭於議會。苟其力量有所不敵。則必别出手段以洩其憤。抑或因國際之間隔。法律勞力。均不能及。乃亦别尋報復方法以快意。此暗殺之風之所由起也。暗殺之風愈盛。愈見世界政象之不寗。試以昨今兩日之外訊言之。蘇俄駐日商務參贊安尼基夫氏。被日人佐籐信勝。以手槍耍擊於汽車上。傷頗重。據供爲憤俄國破壞日本漁業之故此其一事也德國亭堡附近有三人突上街車撃斃共產黨議員并傷及女客。德當局以流血慘劇屢見。雖明知爲國家社會黨與共產黨之爭。然亦無法制止。此又一事也。阿眞廷京城電。日前在電車中發現炸彈。炸傷意大利無政府黨人比利蒂及二乘客。雖已查明該炸彈非爲某皇太子而發。然實含有政治意味。不難逆料。此又一事也。維也納電。今日奥警察發覺塞爾維亞人所組之秘密機關。謀暗殺亡命此間之洛特與逹爾瑪特兩地要人已拘獲三人。又據塞京電。今晨此間政府辦公室外。忽有炸彈四枚爆裂死一人。傷數人。其爲塞國政爭之故更可顯見。此又一事也。觀此數端。亦足證暗殺之風之烈矣。而世界政局之不安定。亦可於此見之。</p>

<p>國民會議前應有之努力</p>
<p>十六日上午國民政府舉行總理紀念週時于右任講演「國民會議以前對於本黨政綱應有之努力」演詞現經整理發表特錄如下</p>
<p>「我今天報告的題目是國民會議以前對於本黨政綱應有之努力我把他的内容分爲三節第一本黨政綱確立之由來第二全部政綱之重要目的第三如何使本黨的政綱化爲國民的政綱現在逐節的分開來說」</p>
<p>（一）本黨政綱確立之由來第一次全國代表大會宣言國政黨之政綱對外政策第七項對内政策十五項此項政策在宣言中並鄭重聲明「皆吾人所認爲黨綱之最小限度目前救濟中國之第一步方法」又總理手定之建國大綱二十五條在這大綱第一條説明「國民政府本革命之三民主義五權憲法以建設中華民國」因此我們對於本黨所確定的政綱有當特别注意之點從本黨政綱的產生方面來說本黨政綱係本黨改組後第一次全國代表大會所决定黨内最高權力機關的决議就是黨的命令並且這個决議曾經宣示於全國人民及全世界的建國大綱爲總理所手定就是本黨政治設施的最高原則將來制定成文的根本大法時應當以這個最高原則爲根據從本黨政綱的要旨方面來說對内對外政策旣是本黨黨綱的最小限度而爲救濟中國的第一步辦法當然本黨的革命使命絶不止此建國大綱又以建設中華民國的責任對於本黨的國民政府所謂「本於革命三民主義五權憲法」特别提出革命二字的重要意義就是說三民主義五權憲法必須是本黨的革命政府繼能去執行繼能去推動並且三民主義五權憲法是以革命的必要贯澈始終的在時間上絶對不能把革命的關係間或離開把革命的意義停止片刻在實質上絶對不能把革命的原則打些折扣把革命的成份仙去幾分</p>
<p>（二）全部政綱之重要目的關於本黨全部政綱的重要目的大家都是曉得的並且很明暸的我今天特别把他提出來而且將他的要點歸納成七項以提醒大家的注意一·這全部政綱是根據三民主義的精義定爲具體的實行方法而且施行的順序和分量方面都是斟酌至當的二·取消一切不平等條約使中國得到國際地位的平等三·清理外債脫離關係債務的困頓使中國政治上實業上不受種種損失與　絆且得自由發展四·政治制　上樹立中央與地方均權的特制（不偏於中央集權不偏於地方分權）以及五權並立的規模使中國成爲眞正民治的國家五·以國家社會主義的精神建設節制資本平均地權的國家並以國家的資力就土地交通電氣礦產森林各種事業方面爲人民供給需要爲人民增加生產實現眞正民有民享的國家免除因資本主義狂暴發展而起的社會貧困和殘酷的階級鬥爭六扶助國内弱小民族改進其政治經濟文化的地位使他們都明暸自决自治並聯合完成帝國主義的國民革命七·增進農人工人的利益要使國民革命所得到的利益能够逹到農人工人的身上</p>
<p>（三）如何使本黨政綱化爲國民的政綱黨的政綱之推行基於過去幾年的經騐得到人民贊助的地方實在不少由此也可以知道黨的政綱是很適合人民的需要的說到建國的責任當然是在本黨但在國民會議後黨的政綱爲全國人民所受就成爲國民自已的政綱而且在約法中要成爲主要的部分全國的人民共同接受此政綱而奮門推動的力量必然强大得多將來所得的成效也必然完满得多但在國民會議以前我們應當有一度精密檢閱和加緊的工作這精密的檢閱就是詳詳細細的把我們的工作做一個總報告也可以說是我們對全國人民的相見禮物我們怎樣去精密檢閱呢關於政綱本身方面先看全部政綱及其施行策略適合於人民需要的程度如何又當看看因施行此政綱而發生的障碍已　除至如何程度此障碍發生於何種方面者爲多此後尙有繼續而起的障碍否革命政府對於　除障碍的决心與力量如何怎樣才能使全國人民瞭解政府信賴政府並且還看看全部政綱斟酌於國際情勢及最近政治經濟的一般傾向有無過高或不及之處關於政府現實的設施方面對於政綱有尙未完成的部份和尙未着手的部份這關係人民信賴政府以及政綱本身的效力很是重大應該怎樣宣示種種狀况於人民增加他們的希望和擁護這政綱的意志關於農工方面政府是否已照政綱所定的各項增加了人民最大多數農人工人們的利益他們　實得到的利益究竟有多少這一　關係本黨革命建國的偉大意義同時也是　固本黨政治基礎的重要工作關於地方自治方面地方自治的實行是本黨訓政時期的中心工作工作如無成績即是本黨的主義和政綱遠没有爲人民所瞭解與擁護如果地方自治的基礎不立則政綱政策所定的各事絶没有全部實行的可能所以全國各縣之地方自治現在辦理到怎樣程度應該有切實的檢點現在我們應當談到加緊工作了在國民會議前工作又是怎樣去加緊推動呢一·在我們政綱和政策裏所决定的各項工作以及迭次會議的决議　最近的如四中全會刷新政治的决議等等這是屬於政治上消極功能部份如澄清吏治罷除苛細稅捐减輕人民担盈所有服行公務人員應努力於其責任一切泄沓因循的積習營私贪污的瑕穢政府都應本於革命的意義用雷霆奮迅的處置毫不瞻徇的去嚴厲的制裁務在最速期間使全國政象　　一新二·在軍事尙未完全底定的區域和匪亂的區域或經反動尙未從事整理的區域應該設法使這些區域的人民有接受本黨主義和政綱的機會使他們能够在國民會議自由表示意志然後才能從全國人民一致的意義上建立眞正民主統一的國家</p>
<p>總括以上的意思我們應當注意國民會議爲期不遠所有一切準備應當完整而迅速尤其要誠實不欺務使本黨政綱確立於會議中化爲國民全體的政綱基於此種偉大而重要的意義凡是服務於政府的官吏本黨的黨員全國的人民都應爲自已的責任和自已的利益而共同努力這尤其是關係國家的長治久安社會利益的均衡進步我鄭重的再說一句大家應當共同努力於國家和平統一之實現爲國民會議之前驅</p>

<p>關稅完全自主後之第一次新稅則自二十年一月一日起實行新稅則草擬時根據以下諸項原則（一）發展國内工業所必需之原料當减輕其進口稅（二）國内工業之須發展者政府當盡量扶掖之使不受外貨競爭之影響（三）抵補裁减各稅十九年進口稅率與十八年比較增减如</p>

<p>根據新關稅則預計收入極爲困難最近三年收入狀况不足以爲標準也槪論之全世界經濟不景氣自必妨碍商業銀價低落自必减少進口贸易同時關稅之增加亦足阻碍進口贸易以後漏稅者或且日多試舉一例以證之絲織品進口稅率十七年份原定爲百分之七·五十八年份增至百分之二二·五後絲織品全年之進口贸易竟自關平銀四二五○○○兩降爲一五二○○○兩環顧國内經濟情形深覺最近期内普通進口貨口稅率不能再加蓋稅率遞高收入遞减經濟原理洵不誣也</p>

<p>— 忠煥</p>
<p>大逹輪船公司行駛滬揚班之大吉輪。沿途經過南通如辠江陰靖江泰興各港埠。而抵揚州。本月十日晚。該輪照例由滬啓椗。趁客約五百餘人。貨件計有硫磺八十餘箱。及糖紙等件。翌午（十一日）經過南通之天生港。登陸者近二百人。該埠有緝私營兵數十名。搭該輪往揚。諸兵在輪吸烟取樂。時輪已過如辠之新陞張黃兩港埠。而向江陰駛去。乃樂極生悲。慘禍暴發。當該輪焚燒時。船員驚惶失措。</p>
<p>生命喪亡約二百餘人。各情迭誌報端。現姑不問肇禍之責屬於誰。兹記其瑣聞如下。</p>
<p>▲石氏贈棺　大逹輪雖行駛滬揚有年。而躉船除滬埠及天生港外。均未設置。悉用划船渡客往返。是日有石姓婦自滬趁該輪返籍。由張黃港輪分公司所備之划船划以登岸。（距岸約三里）划船甫將攏岸。突聞江中震聲極大。料大吉汽鍋炸裂。石氏後得確息。大吉被焚。死亡甚衆。石氏家固富有。苟禍發於先一小時。則生命豈得保全。乃慨贈棺木數具。以備收屍云。</p>
<p>▲父死兒殉　距新陞港里許之石莊鎭。市面甚盛。各商店際此新春例往他埠批貨。是日有余友季君銘勳及沈某昆仲。由新陞港趁該輪前往江陰批貨。迄今消息杳然。沈某之妻方懷孕。聞訊大哭。痛不欲生。致其腹中一塊肉。經此一番驚動。遂告小產。誠可謂父死兒殉也。</p>
<p>▲同歸於盡　有某甲。向在滬埠謀生活。夫婦父母一子全家五人。趁該輪旋里。焚燒時相繼投江。夫經他船救起。顧舉目無一家人。自思生趣毫無。乃復躍江自盡亦云慘矣。</p>
<p>▲迷信傅說　大通輪船公司三年前行駛滬揚班之新大明輪。上水駛距泰興之口岸鎭碼頭不遠。被日帝國主義之厚田丸猛撞。大吉在後聞訊。鼓輪往救。新大明輪見大吉駛近。乃用鐵纜繋於大吉右邊新大明輪上趁客爭先恐後聚於左側。以便躍入大吉而逃命。時新大明正千鈞一髮之際。衆客聚於一處遂告不支。向左斜下。大吉幾被沉。即將鐵纜砍斷。新大明立没江底。死亡約二百人。據一般迷信者言。新大明不救。由於大吉斷纜所致自後大吉行駛隠約見新大明尾隨其後。今日大吉沉没。係新大明作祟云云。無稽之談。可發一笑也。</p>

<p>竹抱虚心夙稱佳物。故竹谿六逸。竹林七賢。自古俊流。雅與此君相契。客有博物者。爲談竹之異類。謂魯省登州。產方竹。堅勁可作仗。天台山中。亦產竹具方形。青翠欲滴。較諸登州所產尤勝。湘之岳陽君山亦有方竹之產。惟皆柔軟而長。不合爲器材耳。陳鼎竹譜。曾載述之。閩省某山產朱竹。穉竹色黃。老則轉爲殷紅。枝葉亦隨竹而異色。叢竹在坡阪間。自遠望之。不　霜楓成林也。某富家特斥巨資。購朱竹於園中。築朱竹樓。附庸風雅。比諸王禹偁黃岡竹樓之遺。落成之日。廣宴賓侶。極觴詠之樂。某名士爲撰朱竹樓記。爲一時所傅誦。斐洲剛果之亞瓜多爾Ｅquator地當赤道。炎氣蒸鬰。人易昏暈。幸該地產香竹。截取幹枝。磨爲粉末。嗅之其氣香烈。仿佛奇楠沉檀。且凉沁心脾。可解昏暈之病。居民腰間。輒掛一囊。皆常備之香竹粉末也。天之生物。因地制宜。亦奇矣哉。</p>

<p>務本女中校長王孝英女士。於上月獲得一麟。校中同人。無不致賀。本月十五日。王校長與李大超君。假中社開湯餅宴。將近午男女同人陸續而至者數十人。席作一字形。相向坐。兩首爲主席。入席後。共敬女主人以酒。以表賀忱。旣而公推陸　庵君代表全體致詞。乃起言天地之大德曰生。世間萬物。無非彼此相生。以期生存於社會。故人生亦分三大時期。第一期爲被生者與被保護時期。第二期。爲生人時期第三期爲已盡生責之實施保護時期。王校長已由第二期而將進於第三期。爲家爲國爲社會。克盡國民天職。蓋所謂實行民族主義者也。且我國舊俗。往往以能光前裕後爲家庭之美德。王校長於一月前爲乃翁祝假。稱觴盡禮。能光前矣。今又得弄璋之慶。非裕後乎。且王校長名孝英。孝者孝其親也。英者樂育英才也。王校長旣孝其親。可謂名副其實。又長校務中。得英才而敎育之。現時樂育他人之英才。又將樂育自已之英才。則不數年後。務校幼稚園中又將添一小英才。更可爲王校長賀者也本地風光。莊諧並作。聞者罔不鼓掌。謂爲妙語。陸君旣長口才。又豪於飲。能與匹者惟吳景　先生耳。正對飲間。而男主人大超君至。君美顏容。服西装。蓋今之城北徐公也。陸君起敬以酒。君以不善飲辭。强之再。始傾一觴。而顂已微酡。王校長謂吾固知其不能飲也。時已三下。席亦將近結束。惟某以有事先行。想賓主盡歡。備極愉快矣。</p>

<p>儉德儲蓄會。爲滬紳商界崇尙儉德諸君所發起。其始賃屋數椽。草創成立。會員寥寥如晨星。未幾漸形發逹。會員日益加多。原有會址。不敷應用。則一再遷居較大之屋。羣衆對於該會。已不期同抱樂觀矣。逮陳福康君被推爲總理事後。苦心孤詣。慘淡經營。益以乃弟增麟。曁老職員李鄭諸君之贊助。會務益形發逹。各界之加入者。乃如水之西流。於是徵集鉅資。自建會所於老靶子路福生路。佔地數畝。有屋百間。除劃出一部爲百星戲院百星菜社外。餘屋尙多。分部辦事。秩序井然。以羣尙奢華之上海。該會獨以提倡儉德聞。淺見者流。未嘗不腹誹之。其所以得此成績者。蓋由衆濁獨清。物極必返。如啖肴蒸日食鮮肥者。偶得清蔬。固未嘗不覺其味之美也。日昨該會爲擴充體育部事。特開游藝大會。來賓千百。濟濟一堂。游藝節目有蔡德芬唐伯麟陳弗立君之清音。（楊翠喜）儉德國樂團之國樂。（將軍令覇王卸甲。）所御琴琶諸樂器。古香古色。幽雅宜人。其聲冷然。尤饒逸趣。陳泰勳君之粤曲。（綠了芭蕉）曲名殊佳。唱則非予所知。以予爲皖人。雖嘗與粤人共事。亡妻級蘭級秋爲粤產。對於普通粤語。略有所知。然粤謳固不解也。所用音樂亦佳。惜予在門墙外。不能舉其名耳。雪倩女士之國技。兎起　落。天矯異常。吾董　眉。愧對此巾幗也。鄭勞生。吳觀華君之粤樂舞。身手活潑。突梯滑稽。予屢爲之捧腹。玫瑰社之魔術。當塲變化。靈敏異常。而以鋸支解生人。尤能令人昨舌。白梅芳。王妹妹。黃麗琳。趙素琴。陳愛倫諸女星之時裝表演。粉白黛綠。三五錯綜。蓮步輕移。柳腰欵擺。殊令人艷羡不已。中華口琴會之口琴。能以兒童玩具。創爲新聲。頗覺出人意外。其進行曲。以區區細物。狀千軍萬馬之奔驣。忽遠忽近。高下分明。不可謂非絶技也。朱士良。楊南英。曹振康。張施央。方玉霖。孫钧卿。夏品甫。王意青。金潤初。戴葆成。陸少安。唐雲卿諸君之平劇。唱做打武。各擅勝塲。得諸票友殊不易易。而楊南英之字宙鋒。尤爲難能可貴。蓋以閩人歌平劇。咬字運腔。居然絲絲入扣。　然有味。已出予意料外。矧彼爲獨臂。（生無右臂其支撑於袖内者人造之僞臂也）做工宜無足觀。詎彼驅使僞臂。竟與眞手無異。演欲上天入地等身段。尤覺活潑自然。毫無斧鑿痕迹。最奇者。名伶楊寳森。不自登塲。乃爲南英操琴。始終無一花點。而隨腔包調。貼合無間。老琴師無以過之。是與南英之獨臂演劇。可稱二難。而評劇家鄭過宜。追隨寳森左右。跬步不離。迨所謂特别跟包也。呵呵。</p>
<p>▲短訊　粤中歌舞明星紫羅蘭孃。近蒞音都。歡迎之衆。舉都若狂。紫孃由其母夫人馬女士偕往拜謁舊日老同盟同志。曁國府要人。酬酢之忙。幾無虚夕。事爲國民大戲院經理唐君所聞。乃往請登台獻校。以餉首都人士。紫孃此次人都。完全爲遊覧名勝。戲裝等具。均留滬上。因之特派人來申料理。於十四日起登台三天。粤劇爲梅妃葬花陳妙常以及各種舞蹈云。（汝嘉）</p>

<p>Negotiating Jurisdictional Rights with the Foreign Minister Today</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Dutch envoy, Oudendijk, arrived in Beijing at noon on the 17th and resided at the Diplomatic Guesthouse. He will soon begin discussions with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding commercial legal jurisdiction issues. (17th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: After arriving in Beijing at noon on the 17th, the Dutch envoy, Oudendijk, notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and arranged with the Foreign Minister to formally negotiate the issue of jurisdictional rights on the afternoon of the 18th. The Dutch envoy brought a reply from his government to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, roughly stating that they are willing to discuss how to abolish jurisdictional rights in China and agree that when all friendly nations are willing to resolve this issue, the Dutch government is also willing to relinquish its consular jurisdiction in all parts of China. The attitude is very good. Currently, our side believes that the Netherlands, Panama, and Brazil have no issues. Although Britain and France have the same demands, they aim to gradually abolish them in stages and zones, but our side can hardly agree. If there are no concrete results before the end of April, decisive measures may be taken. (17th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The surveying of the great eastern port and the great northern port has been carried out by technical personnel jointly dispatched by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways.

The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively negotiate with the Dutch envoy for the return of the funds to facilitate the progress of the two ports.

<h3 id="e12">Zhang Ji Hosts a Reception for Newspaper Reporters in Tianjin and Presides Over the Oath-Taking Ceremony for Gao Jiyi and Others <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: At 6 PM tonight, Zhang Ji hosted a banquet for newspaper reporters at the Hotel des Colonies. Over forty people attended. Zhang gave a speech, roughly stating that Tianjin is the center of public opinion in the north and also an important town in the north. He hopes that the press will embrace the Three Principles of the People created by Sun Yat-sen. He has been away from Tianjin for fourteen years, and now seeing that the municipal administration of the concessions is developed while the Chinese streets are not as good as they were during the Republic of China, he is very saddened. This is probably thanks to years of civil war. The press is the mentor of society, and he hopes they will promote society's entry into the right track. News from the north and south often differs greatly and should be given special attention. When he was in Beijing, he heard rumors of a military alliance in the north, and only when he arrived in Tianjin and Beiping did he realize that society was stable, which made him laugh. The people in the north are suffering from warlords, bandits, and wars, and want to go south to seek a living, but they don't know that although the south is rich, it may not have enough food for the northerners. Just look at the northwest and northeast, which are fertile lands with thousands of miles, and there are ways to get rich through reclamation and animal husbandry. However, they are abandoned, causing Japan to covet the northeast, and Outer Mongolia has already been communized by Soviet Russia. This is really heartbreaking. The press should awaken the people to pay attention to the frontiers. Many deposed warlords and politicians in Tianjin concessions and Dalian live like absentee landlords, each with millions of assets. They can invest in the northeast and northwest, which can not only develop resources but also protect territorial integrity. The government should not discriminate against them but should encourage and protect them. At 9 PM, the gathering ended in joy. (17th Day)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Special Party Department of the Beining Railway held an oath-taking ceremony at 10 AM on the 17th for committee members Gao Jiyi, Gao Zhemin, and Yang Zhihuan to take office. Zhang Ji, representing the central government, attended the ceremony and gave a speech, roughly stating: 1. The political disturbances on the Beining Railway have been the worst in the country. In the future, efforts should be made to develop the railway with the power of the party and help its construction, in line with the Prime Minister's principle of saving the railway to save the country. 2. Attention should be paid to the production and technology of workers, and guidance should be given from time to time. 3. The discipline of the party should be rectified, and the qualifications of party members should be reviewed first, and reactionary elements should be removed. Gao responded by accepting the instructions and said that the workers' movement should be based on the needs of the people's lives, increase the production of the entire railway, and strive to build a rationalized state-owned enterprise, creating a legitimate and meticulous organization of the masses. At 12 PM, a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. Afterward, Zhang invited the preparatory committee members and the city reorganization committee members to the Hotel des Colonies for a banquet. (17th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Because the provincial party department ordered the cessation of activities of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Commerce, a misunderstanding occurred. Zhang Ji is scheduled to invite representatives from both sides to the Hotel des Colonies on the morning of the 18th to explain the situation. (17th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Trend of Assassination <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Invariably, in countries with unstable political situations, a prominent phenomenon is that political views and party disputes are aired in parliament. If their strength is not sufficient to resist, they will resort to other means to vent their anger. Or, because of international distances, the law is laborious, and they cannot reach them, they will seek revenge by other means to satisfy their desires. This is the origin of the trend of assassination. The more prevalent the trend of assassination, the more unstable the world's political situation becomes. Take the foreign news from yesterday and today as examples. Anikiev, the Soviet Russian commercial counselor stationed in Japan, was shot in his car by a Japanese man, Sato Nobukatsu, with a handgun. He was seriously injured. He confessed that he was angry at Russia's destruction of the Japanese fishing industry. This is one incident. Near Dingburg, Germany, three people suddenly boarded a streetcar and shot and killed a Communist Party member, also injuring female passengers. The German authorities, although knowing that it was a dispute between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, could not stop it because bloody tragedies are frequently seen. This is another incident. A dispatch from the capital of Argentina reported that a bomb was found in a tram a few days ago, injuring an Italian anarchist, Bility, and two other passengers. Although it has been clarified that the bomb was not intended for a certain crown prince, it does contain political implications. It is not difficult to predict. This is another incident. A dispatch from Vienna reported that the Austrian police today discovered a secret organization formed by Serbians, plotting to assassinate important figures from Lothar and Dalmatia who had fled here. Three people have been arrested. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from the Serbian capital, four bombs suddenly exploded outside the government office here this morning, killing one person and injuring several others. That it was due to Serbian political infighting is even more evident. This is another incident. Observing these few examples is enough to prove the intensity of the trend of assassination. And the instability of the world's political situation can also be seen from this.</p>

<p>Reuters, March 16th, from 　堡: The local branch of the National Socialist Party has swiftly declared that it was not involved in the assassination of the Communist Party members of the 　堡 Municipal Council and expressed its detestation of the atrocity. Party leader Hitler issued a statement expelling the three assassins from the party but will hire lawyers to defend them during the trial, arguing that their actions were motivated by a temporary frenzy incited by Communist propaganda. Residents of 　堡 fear Communist retaliation. The Communist Party is planning a meeting to protest. Police have taken precautions to prevent disturbances. It is reported that two members of the National Socialist Party were shot and wounded in Altona. The Social Democratic Party has proposed in parliament to adopt more effective measures to prevent incitement to political assassinations and to enact strict laws prohibiting the carrying of lethal weapons.</p>
<p>Reuters, March 16th, Berlin: Communists clashed with police near Berlin, severely injuring four policemen. Communists rioted but were eventually driven back by police, injuring many.

Newspapers have also revisited the assassinations that occurred last summer, making similar demands. Leaders of the National Socialist Party in 　堡 have issued a declaration stating that they are extremely outraged by such brutal actions and have expelled the three perpetrators from the party. The 　堡 Senate has issued an order prohibiting the publication of newspapers by both the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party to prevent their rhetoric from inciting party members to further violence. Prussian Minister of the Interior Shefflering, a prominent leader of the Social Democratic Party, vehemently criticized the violence of extreme elements from both the left and right in the Prussian parliament today, stating that he has ordered the police throughout Prussia to strictly suppress such actions. He also stated that some Republican newspapers are blaming the increased political violence on the courts' leniency toward perpetrators of violence, especially toward the National Socialist Party. Shefflering urged his subordinates to work together to eliminate this force that disrupts national security, regardless of its origin.</p>
<h3 id="e56">One Year and Three Months of Indian Independence Movement: Significant Sacrifices of Life and Property; What Are the Gains? Anti-Gandhi Faction's Activities Worth Noting <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The World News Agency reports, according to Indian newspapers, that the Indian National Congress declared independence on December 19, 1929, and has continued its non-violent anti-British movement for one year and three months. During this period, over 70,000 people have been sacrificed, and the loss of property is estimated by the British Indian government at 350,000 pounds for official property and 270,000 pounds for private property. With such significant sacrifices of life and property, what are the major gains? 1. Coastal residents have the freedom to produce salt. 2. Regarding labor disputes, labor unions have the right to dispatch inspectors. Apart from these two items, there is the revision of the Indian Constitution as decided by the British Indian Round Table Conference. The main points of this case are five: 1. A representative conference is established in British India and the kingdoms to organize the Indian Federation. 2. The federal parliament is the entire central parliament. 3. Expand the election and eligibility of state governors to include all administrative matters within the state. 4. Separate India and Burma into two administrative units. 5. The Indian army is commanded by British officers, and the powers of the Governor-General of India remain unchanged, retaining the power of veto and reservation. The representatives of ethnic minorities are all officially selected, and officials of the Governor-General's Office can be members of parliament. From all these points of view, it is far from complete autonomy. As for the local councils, everything is of a committee nature. The governors of each state are appointed by the Governor-General, and the Governor-General can also dismiss the state governors. How can this be called complete local autonomy? Therefore, after the agreement between Indian Governor Irwin and Gandhi was reached, absolute independence advocates and various factions of the left wing were extremely dissatisfied with Gandhi, and the National Congress Party was also divided into Gandhi and anti-Gandhi factions. The future activities of this anti-Gandhi faction are worth noting.</p>

He also urged that the personal expenses of the princes be reduced and that the majority of their income be used for the well-being of the people, and that religious freedom should be respected. Governor-General Irwin also advocated for finding ways to maintain close ties between rulers and the ruled. The Princes' Conference will continue for a week.</p>

<p>National News Agency, March 16th, Geneva: The European Tariff Truce Conference reconvened today. Chairman Korzhen, representing the Netherlands, warned the representatives of various countries that if the issues under discussion at the conference are not resolved, the entire European economic life will suffer greatly, with the abolition of certain commercial treaties being one such consequence. The German representative then stated that the agreement reached at the conference this year has been passed by the German Parliament in three readings and is expected to be approved and notified to the conference within this week. However, Germany will also state the conditions attached to the implementation of the agreement, the most important of which is that it must be approved by the UK and France. The French representative also stated that due to certain economic difficulties, France cannot approve the agreement unless the current conference and the signatory countries agree to make significant amendments.</p>

<p>Reuters, March 16th, London: The fifth clause of the People's Participation Bill, stipulating the abolition of university representatives, was rejected by the House of Commons today by a vote of 246 to 242. The government failed. Eleven members of the Liberal Party, including Sir Simon, voted against the government, causing great anger among the Labour Party, as the bill was a direct concession from Labour to the Liberal Party. Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the matter would be delayed for consideration, which can be seen as a warning from the government to the Liberal Party, implying that the government has the power to revoke the bill. Although the government failed, it will not lead to a political crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters, March 16th, London: British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons today in response to questions from members of parliament that negotiations with China regarding consular jurisdiction are progressing rapidly, as far as its complex nature permits. He is currently unable to elaborate on the details of the negotiations. A Conservative member of parliament stated that the Foreign Secretary should investigate the reasons why the Chinese government is issuing domestic bonds secured by increased customs duties, while still owing debts to British road debts. The British Foreign Secretary replied that Ambassador Lampson has contacted the Chinese government about this matter. The Debt Consolidation Conference began in Nanjing last November and has not yet been fully planned. At this time, he is unable to conduct any investigation so as not to hinder the conference.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Yu Youren's Speech at the National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Efforts Needed Before the National Assembly</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, during the National Government Memorial Week for the late Founding Father, Yu Youren delivered a speech on "Efforts That Should Be Made for the Party Program Before the National Assembly." The speech has now been compiled and published, and is excerpted below.</p>
<p>"The topic of my report today is the efforts that should be made for the Party Program before the National Assembly. I have divided the content into three sections: 1. The origin of the establishment of the Party Program; 2. The important objectives of the entire Party Program; 3. How to transform the Party Program into a National Program. Now, I will explain each section separately."</p>
<p>(1) The Origin of the Establishment of the Party Program: The declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang stated the Party's program, with seven items for foreign policy and fifteen items for domestic policy. The declaration solemnly stated that "these are the minimum limits that we consider to be the Party Program and the first step in saving China." Furthermore, the twenty-five articles of the Founding Father's Outline of National Reconstruction explained in the first article that "the National Government will construct the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution of the revolution." Therefore, we should pay special attention to the established Party Program. From the perspective of the Party Program's origin, the Party Program was a resolution of the highest authority within the Party decided by the First National Congress of the Kuomintang after the Party's reorganization, which is the Party's command. This resolution has been declared to the people of the entire country and the world. The Outline of National Reconstruction, personally determined by the Founding Father, is the highest principle for the Party's political facilities. In the future, when formulating the fundamental laws in writing, this highest principle should be used as the basis. From the perspective of the essence of the Party Program, the domestic and foreign policies are the minimum limits of the Party Program and the first step in saving China. Of course, the Party's revolutionary mission is definitely not limited to this. The Outline of National Reconstruction emphasizes the important significance of the word "revolution" by entrusting the responsibility of building the Republic of China to the Party's National Government, "based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution of the revolution." This means that the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution must be consistently implemented and promoted by the Party's revolutionary government. In terms of time, the revolutionary relationship should never be interrupted or abandoned, and the revolutionary significance should never be suspended even for a moment. In terms of substance, the revolutionary principles should never be compromised, and the revolutionary components should never be reduced.</p>
<p>(2) The Important Objectives of the Entire Party Program: Everyone knows and understands the important objectives of the entire Party Program. Today, I am specifically bringing it up and summarizing its main points into seven items to remind everyone: 1. The entire Party Program is based on the essence of the Three Principles of the People and is defined as a concrete implementation method, and the order and quantity of implementation have been carefully considered. 2. Abolish all unequal treaties and allow China to obtain equal international status. 3. Clear up foreign debt and escape the predicament of related debts, so that China's political and industrial sectors will not suffer various losses and be able to develop freely. 4. Establish a special system of balanced power between the central and local governments (without leaning towards central centralization or local decentralization) and a five-power structure in the political system, so that China can become a truly democratic country. 5. Build a country that controls capital and equalizes land ownership in the spirit of national socialism, and use national resources to provide the people with the needs of land, transportation, electricity, minerals, forests, and various industries, increase production for the people, and realize a truly民有民享 (of the people, by the people, for the people) country, eliminating the social poverty and brutal class struggle caused by the rampant development of capitalism. 6. Assist weak and small ethnic groups in the country and improve their political, economic, and cultural status so that they can all understand self-determination, autonomy, and jointly complete the national revolution against imperialism. 7. Increase the benefits for farmers and workers so that the benefits gained from the national revolution can reach the farmers and workers.</p>
<p>(3) How to Transform the Party Program into a National Program: The implementation of the Party Program has received considerable support from the people based on the experience of the past few years. From this, it can be seen that the Party Program is very suitable for the needs of the people. The responsibility of national reconstruction naturally lies with the Party, but after the National Assembly, the Party Program will be accepted by the people of the entire country and become their own program. Moreover, it should become a major part of the provisional constitution. When the people of the entire country jointly accept this program and promote its momentum, the strength will inevitably be much greater, and the results obtained in the future will inevitably be more complete. However, before the National Assembly, we should have a meticulous review and intensified work. This meticulous review is to make a comprehensive report on our work in detail, which can also be said to be our meeting gift to the people of the entire country. How do we meticulously review it? Regarding the Party Program itself, we must first see how suitable the entire Party Program and its implementation strategies are to the needs of the people. We must also see to what extent the obstacles that have arisen due to the implementation of this Party Program have been eliminated, in which aspects these obstacles mostly occur, and whether there will be continued obstacles in the future. We must also see how the revolutionary government's determination and strength to eliminate obstacles are, and how to make the people of the entire country understand and trust the government. We must also see whether the entire Party Program takes into account the international situation and the recent general trends of politics and economy, and whether there are any aspects that are too high or insufficient. Regarding the government's current facilities, there are parts of the Party Program that have not yet been completed and parts that have not yet been started. This is very important in relation to the people's trust in the government and the effectiveness of the Party Program itself. We should explain various situations to the people to increase their hope and support for the will of the Party Program. Regarding the farmers and workers, whether the government has increased the interests of the majority of the people, the farmers and workers, according to the items stipulated in the Party Program, and how much actual benefit they have received. This is related to the great significance of the Party's revolutionary nation-building and is also an important task for consolidating the Party's political foundation. Regarding local autonomy, the implementation of local autonomy is the central task of the Party's tutelage period. If the work has no achievements, it means that the Party's doctrines and programs have not been understood and supported by the people. If the foundation of local autonomy is not established, then the various matters stipulated in the programs and policies will never be fully implemented. Therefore, we should have a thorough review of the extent to which local autonomy in the counties across the country is being handled now. Now, we should talk about intensifying our work. How do we intensify the promotion of work before the National Assembly? 1. The various tasks decided in our programs and policies, as well as the resolutions of successive meetings, such as the recent resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session on refreshing politics, etc. This belongs to the passive functional part of politics, such as clarifying official governance, abolishing harsh and trivial taxes, and reducing the burden on the people. All public service personnel should strive for their responsibilities, and the government should take decisive action based on the meaning of the revolution to deal with all lazy, stagnant habits, and selfish, corrupt flaws. We must use lightning-fast treatment to severely punish them without any consideration. We must strive to quickly refresh the political image of the entire country. 2. In areas where military affairs have not been completely settled and in areas of banditry or areas that have not been reorganized after being reactionary, we should find ways to give the people of these areas the opportunity to accept the Party's doctrines and programs so that they can freely express their will at the National Assembly. Only then can we establish a truly democratic and unified country in the unified sense of the people of the entire country.</p>
<p>To summarize the above, we should note that the National Assembly is not far off, and all preparations should be complete and rapid. In particular, we must be honest and not deceive, and strive to ensure that the Party Program is established in the Assembly and transformed into the program of the entire nation. Based on this great and important significance, all officials serving in the government, members of the Party, and the people of the entire country should work together for their own responsibilities and their own interests. This is especially related to the long-term stability of the country and the balanced progress of social interests. I solemnly say again that everyone should work together to achieve the peaceful unification of the country as a precursor to the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3 id="e69">Ministry of Finance's 18th Fiscal Year Financial Report (Continued) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>However, although tariff revenue has increased, the repayment of principal and interest on foreign loans and war indemnities has also greatly increased due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, almost offsetting each other. It is estimated that more than £8.5 million must be allocated from customs and salt taxes each year to repay these loans and indemnities. The following table lists the loan and indemnity repayments (calculated in national currency) and their conversion rates for recent years:</p>
<p>Year Gold Pound to National Currency Payout in National Currency</p>
<p>Rate (Approximate) (Approximate Number)</p>
<p>14th Year (Average) Each Pound converted to</p>
<p>National Currency 8.9 Yuan 760,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>18th Year (Average) 11.7 Yuan 1,000,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>19th Year (Average) 16.7 Yuan 1,420,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>20th Year (Average) 21.6 Yuan 1,840,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>In order to encourage domestic commerce, the government completely abolished re-import duties, half duties on subsidiary ports, and the five inland regular customs duties on January 1, 20th year. The five inland regular customs duties on imported foreign goods have also been abolished. As for the regular customs duties on local goods, they will also be abolished immediately after the export tariff rules are revised. The government has suffered huge losses after abolishing the above taxes, but it is willing to bear the pain for the sake of domestic commercial interests.</p>
<p>The first new tariff after the complete autonomy of customs duties was implemented on January 1, 20th year. The following principles were followed when drafting the new tariff: (1) The import tax on raw materials necessary for the development of domestic industry should be reduced. (2) The government should support domestic industries that need to be developed as much as possible to prevent them from being affected by foreign goods competition. (3) The increase or decrease in import tariff rates in the 19th year compared with the 18th year to compensate for the tax reductions are as follows:</p>
<p>Goods Percentage Increase Decrease</p>
<p>Imported Goods 10 percent Tax rate reduction</p>
<p>Same as above 43 percent Tax rate same as 18th year</p>
<p>Same as above 21 percent Increase of 2.5 percent</p>
<p>Same as above 9 percent Increase of 5 or 7.5 percent</p>
<p>Same as above 10 percent Ad valorem increase of 10 percent or more. The largest increase in tax rates is for matches and porcelain. Other items such as sugar, cement, glass, soap, cosmetics, silk, rayon, and woolen fabrics have also seen increases in tax rates compared to before. The high import tax rates in our country today are comparable to those of heavily taxed countries in Europe and America.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to predict income based on the new tariff rules. The income situation of the past three years is not sufficient to serve as a standard. Generally speaking, the global economic downturn will inevitably hinder commerce, and the low silver price will inevitably reduce import trade. At the same time, the increase in tariffs will also hinder import trade. In the future, tax evasion may become more frequent. To illustrate this, the import tax rate on silk fabrics was originally set at 7.5 percent in the 17th year, and increased to 22.5 percent in the 18th year. Afterwards, the annual import trade of silk fabrics actually dropped from Customs Tael 425,000 to 152,000. Looking at the domestic economic situation, I deeply feel that the import tax rate on ordinary imported goods cannot be increased again in the near future. The economic principle that higher tax rates lead to lower income is indeed true.</p>
<p>Salt Affairs Since the reorganization of the Salt Affairs Inspectorate in accordance with the new regulations, the authority to collect taxes and weigh and release salt in each region has been gradually restored in a unified manner. The authority of the Inspectorate on both sides of western Hubei has now been completely restored. Interference with the authority to collect taxes and weigh and release salt in the Fujian region has been completely prohibited. The duties of the Inspectorate in the Guangdong region had been suspended for many years, and branch offices in the region were established one after another in the 19th year, and have now achieved considerable results. Henan Province has never had an inspection agency, but the Henan Salt Affairs Tax Collection Bureau was established in November of the 18th year, but was only able to actually collect taxes in December of the 19th year due to the influence of the current situation. Now all salt affairs inspection branches in the country have been completely restored, and the Inspectorate's internal affairs have also been actively reorganized. There have been significant changes in the important officials in the office this year. During the spring and autumn seasons of the 19th year, transportation in several important salt regions was obstructed and transportation was suspended due to military influences. However, the salt tax revenue in the second half of the 19th year far exceeded the revenue in the same period of the 18th year. A comparison of the salt tax revenue for the two periods is listed below:</p>
<p>Revenue from July to December of the 18th year Revenue from July to December of the 19th year</p>
<p>July 8,905,943 Yuan 13,082,116 Yuan</p>
<p>August 8,739,908 Yuan 9,928,016 Yuan</p>
<p>September 12,145,726 Yuan 12,578,082 Yuan</p>
<p>October 11,156,885 Yuan 14,087,985 Yuan</p>
<p>November 9,267,794 Yuan 12,504,725 Yuan</p>
<p>December 7,204,700 Yuan 12,627,424 Yuan</p>
<p>Total 57,519,956 Yuan 74,808,298 Yuan</p>
<p>The total revenue of the Salt Affairs Inspectorate in the 18th fiscal year increased by more than 27 million yuan compared with the average annual revenue of the previous five years (from the 12th to the 16th year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>In the 18th fiscal year, a total of £817,790 in British currency, equivalent to 10,818,113 yuan in national currency, was repaid from salt funds for various foreign debts. In the first half of the 19th fiscal year (from July to December of the 19th year), £654,351 in British currency was repaid for foreign debts, equivalent to 11,490,479 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 19th year, due to the daily decline in the price of silver, the amount of foreign debt to be paid by each region set in October of the 18th year was insufficient to cover the repayment of debts when they became due. Therefore, starting in April of the 19th year, all scheduled quotas were uniformly increased by 30 percent.</p>
<p>Although the price of gold soared this year and the funds to be paid by several regions in the north province were intercepted by the Shanxi side, all funds that should be paid and supplemented as stipulated in the Salt Affairs Loan Declaration in September of the 18th year were still allocated on schedule without delay.</p>
<p>Except for those affected by military affairs, the performance of the provinces and regions that implemented the various new systems promulgated in the 17th fiscal year for tobacco and alcohol taxes this year was even more remarkable. The tax rate for public sales of tobacco and alcohol in all provinces was uniformly set at 20 percent to show unification. Significant progress has also been made in abolishing local surcharges and miscellaneous levies. The registration methods for tobacco and alcohol merchants have been carried out in all provinces except for remote areas. The regulations on public sales of tobacco, the tax regulations on foreign wines, the tax regulations on various types of tobacco business licenses, and various inspection and fine regulations either still used the old system or the provinces governed themselves, and were unable to fully comply with the regulations. All of these were re-ordered and promulgated this year. For the convenience of implementation, although various tobacco and alcohol regulations were ordered by the Ministry, the detailed implementation rules and forms were all allowed to be drafted by the provincial bureaus after considering the local situation and submitted for verification and approved by the Ministry. The revenue from tobacco and alcohol taxes in all provinces has gradually increased since the previous year. The direct revenue of the national treasury was approximately 1.25 million yuan per month in the six months from July to December of the 19th year.</p>
<p>The greatest progress in stamp duties this year has been the promotion of stamp duties in concessions. In the past, Chinese merchants operating in leased territories often evaded affixing stamps. After active negotiations with the concession authorities, they have gradually complied. Now, the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession have successively established offices in Shanghai to handle all stamp duty matters. Once the source of taxation is promoted, income will also increase sharply.</p>
<p>The contractor system (where various groups purchased a fixed amount of stamps each year) was ordered to be abolished in the 17th fiscal year. This year, the work was continued and the actual posting of stamps was strictly enforced, resulting in satisfactory results. The contractor system was completely prohibited at the end of the 18th fiscal year. Significant progress has also been made this year in unifying stamp tax票. The new tickets manufactured by the Ministry are now being used and affixed throughout the country.</p>
<p>In addition to strictly enforcing new systems and selecting personnel to go to towns and cities for practical inspections, the Ministry also re-verified the expenses of various bureaus to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. As a result, the average monthly direct revenue of the national treasury in the five months from July to November of the 19th year reached 600,000 yuan. However, this increase in revenue is due to effective reorganization, peace, emphasis on the overall situation, and pacification. Cigarette Tax In April of the 19th year, the area for cigarette tax collection was expanded to Guangxi. In September, Henan also changed to unified tax collection. The method of collecting goods transported to Weihaiwei and Dalian was also improved this year. Since March of the 19th year, several provinces have successively experienced military events, resulting in a shortage of tax revenue. During the military period, the average monthly revenue was only 2.7 million yuan. After the end of the military events in October, tax revenue also increased accordingly, with monthly revenue of approximately 4 million yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Investigating the Huai River Situation</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence The Minister of Communications of the League of Nations, Haas, and the Minister of Economic Affairs, Souald, and the Minister of Health, Lakshman, have come to China one after another at the invitation of our government to study various issues in China. They will provide considerable assistance to various construction projects. Haas is particularly interested in our country's transportation and water conservancy projects. He has repeatedly investigated the progress of the projects with the competent authorities in Beijing. He also accompanied his engineering expert, Luke Xi (Luke is a traffic commissioner of the League of Nations), to the Huai River Guidance Committee to inquire in detail about the progress of the Huai River Guidance Project and the progress plan. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially asked him to take the opportunity to inspect the Huai River situation and contribute his findings to the Huai River Guidance Committee when he feasted Haas in Beijing. After Haas returned to Shanghai from Beijing, he telegraphed the Huai River Guidance Committee to schedule a trip to the north. Chairman Chiang of the Huai River Guidance Committee sent Assistant Engineer Jiu Yefan to Bengbu in advance with a letter to contact military and police agencies for all matters in order to protect Haas properly when he arrives. Jiu arrived in Bengbu on the night of the 12th and stayed at the Transportation Villa on Erma Road. He then went to the 45th Division Headquarters and the Land and Water Public Security Bureau to contact them about protection matters. It was decided that the Transportation Villa would be Haas's residence. Haas departed from Shanghai and traveled north the day before yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Luke Hick. After arriving in Beijing, the Huai River Guidance Committee sent engineers Wang Huzhen and Wang Feng to accompany them to the north. This morning (16th), at 0:30, Haas and others arrived in Bengbu on the Pingpu through train. After getting off the train, they went to the Transportation Villa to rest. It is said that Haas plans to inspect the upper reaches of the Huai River first, and then inspect the lower reaches. The Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau pre-hired a Jiangning-branded small steamer with a tugboat and sent seven long police officers to protect the boat. The 45th Division also sent eight officers and soldiers to accompany them. Haas and others went to Hexia at 10:00 this morning to board a ship and head west to Huaiyuan to inspect the river shape. They are scheduled to return to Bengbu in the afternoon, and then go east to Linhuai for inspection (16th).</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu took a special train north from Jinan on the 12th to inspect the area. He first went to Yucheng and got off the train. As a result of the inspection, because Tang Weichun, the president of the county court, did not handle the backlog of cases, he immediately telegraphed Wu Zhenzan, the president of the Shandong Higher Court, to dismiss Tang and give the county magistrate a demerit and fine him two yuan per day. The judge was fined one yuan per day until the backlog of cases was completed. This fine will be used as the food allowance for prisoners, and a bailiff was detained. Then, he took a train north to Pingyuan and got off to review the Northern Shandong Militia Army General Commander Zhao Renquan's troops. A prison officer in the county was detained for having an addiction and then released. He arrived in Dexian that night and reviewed the 59th Brigade of the 20th Division stationed in Dezhou, Zhao Xinde's troops, the next morning. A machine gun company commander was replaced on the spot for being incompetent. At 6:00 p.m. on the 14th, he took a train south from Dezhou and arrived in Yucheng at 9:00 p.m. and stayed in the train. This morning (15th) at 7:00 a.m., he took a car east, and plans to go from Linyi to Shanghe, then to Huimin, then to Lijin, then to Binzhou, and then to Zhanhua. He will return to Yucheng on the 21st, and the special train will be sent back to Jinan from Yu Cheng by adjutant Kang Hanmin at 10 o'clock this morning. It is scheduled to open in Yucheng again on the 21st to meet him (15th).</p>
<h3 id="e72">Shantou Relieves Unemployed Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence Due to the decline in the price of rubber and tin ore in the Nanyang Islands, the government restricts production, so industry and commerce are depressed, and the number of unemployed overseas Chinese returning to the country is increasing day by day. Since last year, no less than several thousand people have been sent back to Shantou by the British and Dutch authorities. Wandering on the road, it is very pitiful. The fellow villagers associations in Shantou are unable to provide relief due to the continuous arrival of these overseas Chinese. They have appealed to the government on behalf of the victims. The provincial government then formed a Relief Committee for Unemployed Overseas Chinese last month, and the Construction Department issued a notice to the Chaozhou-Meizhou transportation agencies that overseas Chinese who are old, weak, or carrying children and who have an official letter with the seal of the Unemployment Relief Association will be exempt from boat and car fares so that they can return to their hometowns to reunite and not be displaced in the middle of the journey. Chen Weitao was then sent to Shantou to investigate everything and find ways to accommodate them, and allocated 10,000 yuan to Chen to set up an overseas Chinese reception center in Shantou to accommodate them. Chen arrived in Shantou on the Chaozhou wheel on the 10th and was preparing at the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society. Mayor Zhang Lun of Shantou returned to his hometown of Dabu on the 9th to investigate the coal mines near Dama. It is said that the coal field is in Han.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Chaoyang Nanling Red Bandits Flee to Zijin <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence The Erling Mountains, which border Chaoyang, Puning, and Huilai, stretch for more than a hundred miles. The remnants of the Red Army's 47th and 49th Regiments gather in the mountains and often harass the three counties of Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai. Xiang Hanping of the 62nd Division once convened a conference of military and civilian officials from the three counties of Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai in Shantou in mid-February to suppress bandits. It was decided to use the method of encirclement to build fortresses and watchtowers in Huilai Lin Zheshi, Chaoyang Lin Zhao Township, and Pu Kuan Wangtianshi, and install long-distance telephones for more than 500 miles around the mountain to prevent bandits from going out to loot and starve to death in the mountains. Wu Jianhong, Luo Jinying, and Luo Xiuli were assigned to garrison the key points of the three counties of Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai to prevent the bandits from escaping. The Red Bandits in Nanling were panicked. On February 23, about 800 people, more than 200 short guns, and three mobile machine guns suddenly emerged from Nanling into Huilai. On the 24th, they fled through the Meitian area of Huilai and were intercepted by Liang Yanxiang of the 1st Battalion of the Luo Regiment. More than 100 bandits were killed on the spot, and the rest fled to the Beixi area of Lufeng County, where they were intercepted by the 2nd Battalion of the Luo Regiment, led by Song Yifen, and killed the pseudo-Red Army Regiment Commander Lin Junjie. Liang Ying heard that the battle had occurred in Beixi and set off from Kuitan, Huilai, on March 2 to pursue them. On the 5th, he assisted Song Ying and the Haifeng garrison to suppress the Red Bandits in Jieshixi. Seeing our army's arrival, they fled to Dashan, Paozi Village, Zijin County. Liang Ying and others returned to Lufeng City from Jieshi on the 7th. There has been a telegram to Shantou reporting that a group of Red Bandits have gathered in Nanling and are said to be fleeing elsewhere (March 10).</p>

<h3 id="e75">The Eastern Railway Bureau Tightens Meeting <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Will Dismiss Chinese Workers for the Second Time</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence Since the decline of the Eastern Railway's business last autumn, it has remained sluggish. Although the reasons for this are due to the depression of the northern Manchurian market, the gold-based freight rates are unsuitable for the silver-based business environment, and the Dongtie-Wutie agreements are lower than the Mantetsu, making it impossible for goods to be transported south. However, this is a planned and organized strategy of Soviet Russia, so it is not easy to change. On the 10th and 11th of this month, the Railway Bureau held a road affairs meeting attended by all the directors and engineers of the bureaus and departments, totaling more than one hundred people. On the first day, the Russian Bureau Director, Rudyi, gave a speech, saying that the responsibility of accountants is not only to keep accounts, but also to pay attention to the number of expenses not exceeding the fixed range. If the expenses exceed the fixed amount, they must report to the superiors to find a way to correct them. The travel time of freight cars must be the same as that of passenger cars in order to save time and transport more goods. The purchase of materials should be handled by the materials department to stipulate economical methods to avoid being uneconomical. At the end of the two-day meeting, dozens of measures were stipulated for the entire road to economize and increase revenue. All engineering and technical budgets should be based on the 1924 standards to achieve considerable results. At the closing meeting at 7:00 p.m. on the 11th, Mo Dehui and the Chinese and Russian directors attended. Mo delivered a speech, saying that the Eastern Railway is a transportation line between Europe and Asia, and is not only closely related to the transportation between China and the Soviet Union, but also occupies a place in world transportation. If it can be managed with daily progress and meritorious service, it will also be the glory of China and the Soviet Union. The business of the Eastern Railway depends on transportation. Since the two seasons last year, with the changes in the world economy and the sluggish sales of special products in northern Manchuria, business has plummeted. We should seek ways to relieve the situation. The current situation of the Eastern Railway lies in implementing austerity and financial management policies, in increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Staff reduction and salary reduction are just one of the events. Other payments must be verified in everything. Everyone should embrace an austerity policy, and only by working together can we overcome this difficulty. On the afternoon of the 12th, the Russian Bureau Director of the Railway Bureau again hosted a banquet at the Railway Club for all the participants to discuss the implementation of the austerity plan. It is said that there may be a second batch of large layoffs this month, and the internal decision is to lay off 300 Chinese workers in 36 factory sheds. This matter has been proposed by the Russian Bureau Director to the Board of Directors, and the Chinese and Russian directors are still in negotiations and have not yet decided (12th).</p>

<p>Shenyang Correspondence Jing Yue, representative of the Shanxi generals, came to Shenyang for the second time on the 5th of this month to discuss the post-war issues of the Jin army. I recently visited Jing and talked about this visit. He has visited Deputy Commander Zhang several times in recent days, and the following points have been discussed with Deputy Director Ling: (1) Deputy Commander has agreed to borrow half of the Jin army's dispatch fees in advance and remit them in advance. The loan can be successful within days. (2) The Jin generals are eager to pay their respects since they were reorganized by Deputy Commander Zhang, and the Deputy Commander is also eager to meet them. It is planned that they will come to Shenyang one after another to pay their respects. (3) Although the Shanxi arsenal seems to be slightly scaled on the surface, half of its contents are people who do not meet scientific principles. If we want to improve it and make it suitable for use, the cost will be almost the same as starting a new one. We should plan a considerable way to deal with it. (4) Deputy Commander Zhang of Shanxi Finance is willing to find a way to maintain a fixed price for the banknotes in order to avoid innocent merchants from suffering losses (separate detailed plan). (5) The Shangdai of Shanxi's troops to suppress the Communists will be submitted to the central government for approval after detailed discussion. Other matters concerning the post-war affairs of the Shanxi military and civilians must continue to be discussed in detail. Jing also showed a telegram to each Jiangling, saying, "Taiyuan Sun Cuiyai, Army Commander, Rong Jia San Commander and the commanders of each division, brothers. After a detailed talk with the vice chairman, the vice chairman is eager to meet you. You can come to Shenyang one after another to pay your respects. It is important to re-compile half of the fees so that you can borrow and ask to tell the brothers Jinyao Yuekou". According to reports, in addition to Jing, Fu Zuoyi also sent his chief of staff Zhu Mingsan to Shenyang a few days ago to visit Zhang once. Former Northwest Army generals Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun also sent representatives to Shenyang. Zhang's representative was Qin Decun, and Song's representative, Bai Yiren, had already met with Zhang to report on the situation after the reorganization and ask for military pay and defense areas (March 14).</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Province Coastal Fisheries Protection Conference held its opening ceremony in the provincial government conference room yesterday (16th). Thirty-two representatives from the Ministry of Industry, Finance, and Navy, various fisheries administrative agencies, and county fisheries associations attended. First, Chairman Ye Chucang of the provincial government reported that today's fisheries protection conference in the province brought together representatives from all fisheries-related agencies in the province and coastal defense agencies to jointly discuss the extremely long coastline of Jiangsu. The province is a prosperous province for fisheries. In recent years, on the one hand, it has been invaded by Japanese fishing boats and, on the other hand, it has been harassed by pirates. The future of the fishery has generally plummeted. Today, we will discuss protection methods based on the good opinions of the representatives. The province has not yet established complete fishery protection facilities, so the fishermen have not been able to get rid of the suffering they have suffered. The administrative agency is very sorry. Now, under the supervision of the representatives, we will discuss more effective methods without empty talk. The future of the province's fishery will have some hope. Then, the two department heads, Hu Puan and He Yushu, delivered speeches, saying that they were very grateful for everyone's enthusiastic participation. They hope that you can add a layer of protection to the lives of the fishermen who are crying out for help and that you believe that this meeting will have concrete measures. Then, Li Shixiang, a representative of the Ministry of Industry, and representatives of fishermen's organizations delivered speeches one after another, and then took pictures and dispersed. It is reported that the proposals will be reviewed in two groups today, the first being the fisheries group and the second being the protection group. The meeting was chaired by Ye Chucang in the morning and He Yushu in the afternoon. After the review meeting was completed, a dinner was held in the auditorium at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Strict Pressure for Old Debts: The Department of Finance, considering the substantial arrears in land tax from counties of the 16th, 17th, and 18th classes, decided at a provincial government meeting to rigorously investigate and collect these debts to cover the budget deficit for the second half of the current year. A general order was issued to all counties, requiring them to separately list the owed land tax and debts owed by the people and setting a deadline for complete payment within a long or short timeframe this year. However, to date, few have reported payment by the deadline. Therefore, special commissioners are being dispatched to counties with larger arrears to urge payment and prevent delays. Cheng Jingchuan has been appointed as the commissioner for Wuxi, Wujin, and Jiangyin counties. Commissioner Cheng arrived in Wuxi yesterday and, together with Zhuang Yeguang, the director of the Finance Bureau, is meticulously investigating and collecting the land tax arrears and people's debts, setting a four-month deadline for complete recovery. A meeting is scheduled today to gather all tax collectors at the county office for instructions.</p>
<p>A Shocking Incident of Local Bandits Robbing and Injuring a Monk: In the 85th tu (a local administrative division) of Kaihua, 14th District, there is an ancient temple called Chishi Ridge Temple. The abbot, Monk Yueming, was known to possess some money. Xue Chunbao, a local from Shixiang Shang Village (originally a carpenter and currently the tu head), coveted this money. Xue Chunbao and others broke into the temple twice last year, causing significant losses. Yueming, unwilling to cause trouble, did not report the incidents to the county government. However, Xue Chunbao and his gang, believing the monk to be weak and easily bullied, led by Xue Chunbao, his son Quan Gen, and relatives Genfa, Genfu, Renfa, A Qiao, Long Sheng, Genpei, and more than ten others, armed with knives and clubs, scaled the wall and entered the monk's bedroom around 10 PM the night before. They dragged Yueming from his bed and attacked him with knives, causing severe throat injuries. Xue Chunbao and the gang then ransacked the temple, searching every box and chest for two hours, stealing 275 silver dollars and a mosquito net. Yesterday, Monk Yueming went to the city to report the incident to the County Court for an injury examination, submitting a list of the bandits and requesting an investigation by the Jiangsu Provincial Court. The Jiangsu Province Silkworm Seed Industry Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday morning at 10 AM at the Silk Factory Association. Attendees included Shao Shenpei from Dayou Silkworm Seed Farm, Wan Yuncheng from Zhenjiang Seed Production Farm, He Shangping from Nanjing Seed Production Farm, and over 80 representatives from various farms.

<p>Abducted Student Escapes Danger: Xu Heshang, a student at the Qianhua Vocational School in Wuyi, recently returned to his hometown of Mapiqiao to recuperate from an illness. He was kidnapped by bandits on the 26th of last month. Xu's father, Bingwen, received a letter from the bandits demanding 8,000 yuan. He planned to raise 1,000 yuan first and send someone to negotiate. The Nan Tuan branch of Sanhekou near that location received a report on the 15th of this month that bandits frequently appeared in the Jiangjiaxiang area of Ningbei Township. The branch dispatched its patrol team, together with the chief and police of the second police station of the fifth sub-bureau, to surround and search Jiang Yaosheng's house. They apprehended Jiang Yaosheng while he was having lunch at home and rescued the hostage Xu Heshang from the house. They were brought to the Sanhekou Merchant Corps branch for preliminary interrogation. The interrogation revealed the names of several accomplices, and further searches were conducted. At Hengshan Anqiao, they encountered the bandit Wu Xinrong and others. As they prepared to pursue them, Wu fired a gun to resist arrest, injuring a farmer named Bao Jinfu in the right leg. The security team bravely stepped forward and captured Wu. On the afternoon of the 16th, the Merchant Corps branch handed over the captured bandits Jiang and Wu to the Merchant Corps headquarters in the city, who then transferred them to the county government for interrogation. Xu Heshang, who had become seriously ill in the bandits' den, was taken back by his father for medical treatment. Bao Jinfu, who was injured, was sent to the hospital for examination.</p>

<p>Ancient Corpse from the Ming Dynasty Discovered in Haiyan: An ancient tomb was discovered outside the West Gate of Haiyan the day before yesterday. After the grave robbers Feng Laifu and Pan Heshang were arrested for digging up bricks, splitting the coffin, and stealing artifacts, the county authorities discovered a white jade hairpin and four agate buttons. After sending the items to the county, they found a burial urn and a Ming Dynasty "road pass" (路引) from inside the coffin. The text on the vellum woodblock print was clear, filling in ten places with the Heavenly Prefecture seal in bright ink. The pass stated that the deceased was Zheng Cunren, a 25-year-old student of the Imperial Academy from Haiyan County, Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province. County Magistrate Ruan consulted the county records and determined that Zheng was an imperial inspector from the Ming Dynasty, living about 400 years ago. He personally led his staff and local gentry to inspect the site. The corpse's torso was tall and slender, with black hair and grayish-white skin and flesh, remaining relatively intact. However, it had been dug into two pieces, and the ribs were black. The coffin and clothes were destroyed. The magistrate immediately purchased new clothing, hats, and a coffin for reburial and summoned the Star Photography Studio to take a photo for distribution for research.</p>
<p>Freight Railway to be Built Along the Beijing-Hangzhou Canal: Although the foundation of the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway has been laid for some time, the surface has not yet been paved.

<p>Implementation of Inspection of Rice and Grain Exports: Zhejiang Province borders the sea and has a large population. The transport of rice and grain within the province has always been for relieving famine in neighboring areas and has not been prohibited. However, there is concern that unscrupulous merchants may use this as a pretext to transport and sell goods to the mainland, secretly smuggling them overseas for profit. A Maritime Prohibition Bureau (海禁局) was established in the past but was abolished due to poor management. Now, the authorities, to prioritize the people's food supply and strictly prohibit smuggling, have ordered customs officials to assist in strict inspections. A rice and grain export inspection office has been established at Haimen to implement inspections.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Ministry of Education Orders Beijing Municipal Government to Pay Close Attention to Educational Administration <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Government submitted its administrative plan for January to March of the 20th year to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Education to conduct a detailed review of the plan within its jurisdiction and submit a report to the Yuan for review. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Education found that the plan failed to adequately consider the needs of official affairs in relation to schools and education. Yesterday, it issued a response to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Beijing Municipal Government be ordered to pay close attention to educational administration and that the Municipal Education Bureau be ordered to quickly formulate a plan to promote and expand primary education in the capital, as well as a report on past progress, for submission to the Ministry for review.</p>
<p>The original response stated: "After reviewing this plan, it is found that the social education aspects are generally acceptable. However, the plan to add classes in the second semester for school education is insufficient to meet actual needs. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan order the Nanjing Municipal Government to pay close attention to educational administration and designate a certain percentage of the subsidies allocated by the Executive Yuan specifically for the promotion and expansion of primary education. It is also requested that the Executive Yuan order the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau to quickly submit a special report to the Ministry on the plan to promote and expand primary education and the progress made in the past two and a half months for review and decision."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Jiangsu Department of Education Orders County Education Bureaus to Report on the Use of Salt Tax Surcharges for Educational Expenses <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the transfer and allocation of funds.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Order No. 505 instructs the county education bureaus to fill out and submit forms to the department regarding the Yangzhou Audit Sub-Bureau's letter on the collection of educational fees from the salt tax surcharges on the Huainan coastal salt and the four banks of the Yangtze River, which are collected by the sub-bureau, so that the funds can be transferred and allocated.</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Audit Sub-Bureau's official letter stated that it was based on General Audit Office Order No. 201, which was based on Ministry of Finance Instruction No. 24952, which was based on Executive Yuan Instruction, which was based on National Government Order No. 703. The order stated that salt tax is a national revenue and local governments should not levy surcharges. However, due to the turbulent situation, provinces have often relied on salt tax surcharges to easily obtain substantial funds, disregarding the principle of taxation and cleverly establishing names to heavily burden the people. Although a clear order was issued last year to recover and reorganize the surcharges, a small number of provinces have failed to comply because the funds were specifically designated for specific purposes and it was difficult to compensate for the previous deficits. Now that the military situation has stabilized and the national government follows proper procedures, the salt tax is crucial to the central government's finances, and the fragmentation and division that hinders unification cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the Audit Yuan is ordered to instruct all provinces to comply with the order that all existing salt tax surcharge provinces must uniformly transfer the surcharges to the Ministry of Finance for unified collection and review for separate reductions and overall reorganization by March 1, 1931. Even if the surcharge was originally designated for a specific purpose and it is difficult to make up for it in the short term, the province should truthfully report it to the Yuan for review, and the Yuan should instruct the Ministry of Finance to find a way to make appropriate allocations to provide relief and should not delay on the pretext of resistance. After this transfer to the central government for collection and reorganization, local areas must not establish any other names to levy salt tax surcharges, lest they be investigated. This order, etc., in addition to being distributed to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance, is also sent to the various salt affairs agencies for detailed investigation and reporting. The head office is also ordered to instruct the auditing agencies in the various salt districts to quickly and thoroughly investigate the names, tax rates, reasons for levying, time limits, and actual uses of the various surcharges in each district, and to propose appropriate arrangements for the takeover and future reorganization, and report them to the head office within ten days of receiving this document for review and forwarding. This matter is of utmost importance, and no delay is permitted. The sub-bureau is ordered to comply with the ministry's order to investigate, report, and propose arrangements within the time limit to facilitate review and forwarding. This matter concerns educational expenses, and no delay is permitted. According to this, the sub-bureau shall comply with the order. The investigation revealed that merchants in the Huainan coastal salt area pay 5 cents per salt catty for educational expenses, and merchants transporting salt on the four banks pay 9 li per salt picul for educational expenses. These funds are drawn and transported by the salt merchants' associations to the educational institutions for collection and verification. It is reported that the former donations are allocated for use by 21 counties, including Jiangning and Jiangdu. The collection of these funds in the form of surcharges should be transferred to this sub-bureau for collection and credited to the Ministry of Finance from March 1. If the educational institutions in the counties have a need for these funds, they can request the provincial government to transfer them to the Ministry of Finance for allocation. In view of the foregoing, you are hereby requested to investigate and instruct the education bureaus of the counties that allocate these funds. It has been found that this province uses salt tax surcharges to fund education expenses. However, if the county's education expenses have this surcharge, it should quickly investigate to facilitate the transfer and allocation. In addition to issuing separate orders to the Jiangdong bureaus, you are also ordered to investigate and submit the forms to the Nuclear Bureau within three days of receiving this document for review and processing. This matter concerns educational expenses, and no delay is permitted.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Tsinghua Student Representatives Host Beijing Reporters <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Tsinghua University student representatives Lin Wenqian, Liu Hanwen, and Wang Zhen arrived in Beijing and hosted fourteen reporters from various news outlets at the Central Hotel at 6 PM on the 14th. Liu Hanwen first reported that since Luo Jialun's resignation, the university has been maintained by the university affairs meeting. This meeting is currently being led by the acting provost and the deans of the three faculties (arts, science, and law). They are not fully responsible and each person has their own job responsibilities and are unable to oversee everything. Therefore, they are only going through the motions and their measures are unsatisfactory. Ten months have passed and the situation cannot continue. The president of the university has repeatedly cabled to the Ministry of Education, firmly resigning. Also, Tsinghua has a beautiful environment, sufficient funds, and complete facilities. If a president can be found to lead the entire university and the faculty and students cooperate and work hard to develop it, it will not be difficult to become an ideal and perfect higher education institution in the future. Therefore, the appointment of a new president is the unanimous and urgent request of the entire university. However, not having a president is better than having an incompetent president. Having a president who is not suitable is even worse than not having one. Therefore, the students of the university believe that the successor should have at least the following qualifications: rich experience in running schools, well-known reputation, noble character, and profound scholarship. At the same time, they must be able to focus on education, do education for the sake of education, and have the determination and plans to develop Jihua. Based on the above, they hope that the government can select one from the three gentlemen: Zhou Yichun, Zhao Yuanren, and Hu Shi. However, if there is someone more suitable than these three, they will not reject them. The representatives met with Sun Benwen, the director of the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, on the 13th, and with Chen Bulei, the vice minister, on the 14th. They have registered to request an audience with Chairman Chiang. In their presentation to the Ministry of Education, Chen and Sun did not give any specific indication. However, they said that the national government has approved Luo Jialun's resignation and has internally decided on a successor. However, the successor cannot be announced because the national government meeting has not yet approved it. The representatives repeatedly requested information so that they could relay it to the students, but they were all refused. The reason why the government has been extremely conservative and secretive about the selection of the next president of Tsinghua is that many people are vying for the position. They fear that announcing it officially will cause opposition and disputes from various parties. The representatives finally expressed their hope that the government would carefully select the successor to avoid repeating the same mistake. Chen also said that he would take it into consideration. Subsequently, Wang reported on the brief history of the university and the current situation. Then, a reporter spoke. The hosts and guests parted happily around 8 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Declaration of the Eighth Representative Assembly <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The future of Jiangsu education is alarming. Since the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], educational funding has largely relied on land tax appropriations, and the overdue payments from various counties have exceeded two million yuan. In the past two years, the province's educational funding revenues and expenditures have accumulated a deficit of over one million yuan. At this time of year, when harvests are abundant and tax collection is at its peak, the accumulated arrears of various schools still exceed two months. School principals are running around and appealing, but to no avail, and the Education Funding Committee is also sighing helplessly, unable to find a solution. The principles of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen on ensuring educational funding and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's orders on rectifying academic atmosphere and increasing funding are clearly being contradicted. Who should be held accountable for the ineffective fundraising? We colleagues are employed here and initially had no responsibility for planning funding, nor did we disapprove of the authorities' measures. However, since we regard education as our profession, we should treat education as our life. The prolonged delay in funding will break the vitality of schools, and the relationship between spirit and matter is particularly close. If funding is sufficient and arrangements are thorough, the academic atmosphere will naturally improve; otherwise, even if we strive to rectify it, it will be as difficult as rowing against the current. We colleagues are committed to schools and love them as our homes. Therefore, for many years, we have been diligently teaching, showing loyalty and dedication, and never daring to neglect our duties due to financial constraints. Moreover, how can we bear to see the discipline of schools decline due to financial constraints? This sincere heart is why we endure the pain temporarily, hoping for a better future. Who knew that year after year, things would get worse and worse? A good harvest leads to wives weeping, and a warm year leads to children crying from the cold. Personal lives are difficult to maintain, and the education system is gradually declining. Rather than forgetting the precept of not exceeding our position, how can we forget the duty that every citizen has? Jiangsu education is at a point of exhaustion. Knowing its danger and not shouting loudly to support it is disloyal, not loosening our hair and fastening our coronets to save it is unjust, and not adding fuel to the fire to preserve it is unwise. We colleagues, driven by our conscience, have no choice but to make a corresponding expression, so as to urge the authorities to awaken, which still stems from our love for the school, not only to maintain our livelihoods. Moreover, the material treatment we colleagues receive is already so meager. How about the spiritual comfort we get? The director of the Education Department sits high in the hall, unaware of what education is. When difficulties arise, he does not think of ways to solve them. When problems occur, he only knows how to deal with them with high-pressure tactics. We colleagues are suffering and moaning, unable to find comfort for ourselves. If we are blocked from reporting upwards and want to gather opinions to make suggestions, we are suspected of causing trouble and are subjected to coercion and bribery. This is their specialty. Because of this, we have fulfilled our duty for two years. Strong and capable people have been dismissed one after another, and the spirit of hard-boned loyalty has become sycophantic. The spirit of education has been swept away from this point. This is why we colleagues are fearful of the future and have no choice but to weep and tell those who care about education. We hereby submit the following urgent issues for immediate relief for the government and society to investigate:</p>
<p>1.  Request the education authorities to recover the educational funding overdue from various counties.</p>
<p>2.  Request the education authorities to follow the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions to ensure the independence of Jiangsu's educational funding and cease allocating funds to the National Central University.</p>
<p>3.  Request the education authorities to find new sources of government funding and allocate a percentage from the provincial business tax to supplement educational funding.</p>
<p>4.  The funding for each school this semester is nearly three months in arrears. Request the education authorities to quickly issue the funds to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>5.  The cost of living has continued to rise, and the compensation for teachers and staff is still based on the standards stipulated in the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], which is one-fifth lower than that of neighboring provinces. Request the education authorities to find ways to increase compensation to maintain livelihoods.</p>
<p>6.  Regarding educational facilities, the administrative authorities should gather broad opinions and adopt them with the situation, and should not arbitrarily refuse based on personal opinions. March 18, 1931.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Minor Tales of the "Da Ji" Ship Disaster <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Zhonghuan</p>
<p>The "Da Ji" wheel steamer of the Da Da Shipping Company runs the Shanghai-Yangzhou route, passing through Nantong, Rugao, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Taixing, and other ports before reaching Yangzhou. On the evening of the 10th of this month [March], the ship left Shanghai as usual, carrying about 500 passengers and cargo including eighty boxes of sulfur, sugar paper, and other items. The next afternoon (the 11th), it passed Tiansheng Port in Nantong, where nearly 200 people disembarked. Several dozen anti-smuggling soldiers from that port boarded the ship to go to Yangzhou. The soldiers were smoking and having fun on the ship. By this time, the ship had passed the newly risen Zhang and Huang ports in Rugao and was heading towards Jiangyin. But joy turned to sorrow, and a tragic disaster erupted. When the ship caught fire, the crew panicked.</p>
<p>Approximately two hundred people lost their lives. Various reports have been published in the newspapers. Without assigning blame for the disaster, here are some minor tales:</p>
<p>▲ The Shi Family Donates Coffins Although the Da Da steamer has been running the Shanghai-Yangzhou route for many years, it has not set up docks in ports other than Shanghai and Tiansheng Port. Passengers are ferried back and forth by rowboats. On this day, a Mrs. Shi from Shanghai was returning to her hometown on the ship. She boarded a rowboat prepared by the Zhanghuang Port branch office to go ashore (about three miles from the shore). As the rowboat was about to reach the shore, a huge explosion was heard from the river. It was thought that the Da Ji's boiler had exploded. Mrs. Shi later received confirmation that the Da Ji had caught fire and many people had died. The Shi family is wealthy. If the disaster had occurred an hour earlier, their lives would not have been saved. Therefore, they generously donated several coffins for collecting bodies.</p>
<p>▲ Father Dies, Son Sacrificed Shizhuang Town, located a few miles from Xin Sheng Port, is a bustling market. During this New Year period, various shops usually go to other ports to purchase goods. On this day, Mr. Yu Youji, Mingxun, and the Shen brothers traveled from Xin Sheng Port to Jiangyin on the ship to purchase goods. There has been no news of them to date. Mr. Shen's wife is pregnant. Upon hearing the news, she cried bitterly, wishing she were dead. As a result of this shock, she had a miscarriage. It can truly be said that the father died and the son was sacrificed.</p>
<p>▲ Dying Together Mr. A, who was working in Shanghai, took the ship home with his wife, parents, and son, a total of five people. During the fire, they jumped into the river one after another. The husband was rescued by another ship, but when he looked around, he could not find any of his family members. Realizing that life had no meaning, he jumped into the river to commit suicide. It was truly tragic.</p>
<p>▲ Superstitious Rumors Three years ago, the Xin Da Ming steamer of the Da Tong Shipping Company, which also ran the Shanghai-Yangzhou route, was not far from the Kou'an Town dock in Taixing when it was rammed by the Japanese imperialist Atsuta Maru. The Da Ji heard the news in the rear and rushed to the rescue. When the Xin Da Ming saw the Da Ji approaching, it used an iron cable to tie itself to the right side of the Da Ji. Passengers on the Xin Da Ming rushed to the left side in order to jump into the Da Ji and escape. At that critical moment, the passengers gathered on one side, causing the Xin Da Ming to list to the left. The Da Ji was almost sunk, so the iron cable was cut. The Xin Da Ming immediately sank to the bottom of the river, killing about 200 people. According to superstitious people, the Xin Da Ming was not saved because the Da Ji cut the cable. Since then, the Da Ji would vaguely see the Xin Da Ming following behind. Today, the Da Ji sank because the Xin Da Ming was causing trouble. This is unfounded talk and laughable.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Talking About Unusual Bamboos <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Bamboo has long been praised as a fine object for its humble heart. Therefore, the Six Recluses of Zhuxi and the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, all outstanding figures of ancient times, were naturally in harmony with this gentleman [bamboo]. A knowledgeable guest spoke of the unusual types of bamboo, saying that Tengzhou in Shandong Province produces square bamboo, which is strong enough to be used as a cane. Mount Tiantai also produces bamboo that is square, green, and dripping with moisture, even better than that produced in Tengzhou. Junshan Mountain in Yueyang, Hunan Province also produces square bamboo, but it is soft and long, and not suitable for making materials. Chen Ding's Bamboo Genealogy has described this. A certain mountain in Fujian Province produces red bamboo. The young bamboo is yellow, and turns dark red as it gets older. The branches and leaves also change color with the bamboo. When looking from afar at the cluster of bamboos on the hillside, it is like a forest of maple trees covered with frost. A wealthy family spent a huge sum of money to purchase red bamboo for their garden and built a red bamboo building to show off their elegance, reminiscent of Wang Yucheng's Yellow Hill Bamboo Tower. On the day of its completion, they held a grand banquet for guests, enjoying the pleasures of singing and poetry. A famous scholar wrote a record of the red bamboo building, which was widely circulated for a time. In Equator in the Congo of Africa, the equator zone, the heat is stifling, and people are prone to dizziness. Fortunately, the area produces fragrant bamboo. The trunk and branches are cut and ground into powder. Smelling it, the aroma is strong, resembling eaglewood and sandalwood, and it is cool and refreshing, relieving dizziness. The residents often carry a pouch around their waist, which is always filled with fragrant bamboo powder. Heaven's creation of things adapts to local conditions. It is truly amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Witty Remarks at the Wang and Li Tangbing Banquet <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>

<p>Ms. Wang Xiaoying, the principal of Wuben Girls' Middle School, gave birth to a son last month. All of her colleagues at the school offered their congratulations. On the 15th of this month [March], Principal Wang and Mr. Li Dachao held a Tangbing banquet at Zhongshe. Near noon, dozens of male and female colleagues arrived one after another. The seats were arranged in a straight line, facing each other. The chairman was at both ends. After taking their seats, everyone toasted the hostess to express their congratulations. Then, Mr. Lu Xun'an was publicly elected to give a speech on behalf of everyone. He began by saying that the great virtue of heaven and earth is birth. Everything in the world is born of each other in order to survive in society. Therefore, human life is also divided into three major periods. The first period is the period of being born and being protected. The second period is the period of giving birth. The third period is the period of implementing protection, having fulfilled the responsibility of giving birth. Principal Wang has moved from the second period and is about to enter the third period. She has fulfilled her national duty for her family, for her country, and for society. This is the so-called implementation of nationalism. Moreover, our country's old customs often regard the ability to glorify ancestors and benefit future generations as the virtue of the family. Principal Wang celebrated her father's birthday a month ago, offering toasts and showing respect. She can be said to have glorified her ancestors. Now she has the joy of giving birth to a son, isn't this benefiting future generations? Moreover, Principal Wang's name is Xiaoying. Xia means to be filial to one's parents. Ying means to enjoy educating talents. Principal Wang is filial to her parents, so her name is truly in line with reality. She also enjoys educating talents while managing school affairs. Now she enjoys educating the talents of others, and soon she will enjoy educating the talents of her own child. In a few years, there will be another little talent in the kindergarten of Wuben School. This is another reason to congratulate Principal Wang. The local scenery combined formality and humor. The listeners all applauded, saying it was a witty remark. Mr. Lu has a great eloquence and is also a heavy drinker. The only one who can match him is Mr. Wu Jingzhi. They were drinking face to face when the host, Mr. Dachao, arrived. Mr. Li is handsome and wears a Western suit. He is like Xu Gong from the northern part of the city. Mr. Lu got up to offer a toast. Mr. Li declined, saying he was not a good drinker. He was forced to drink again. He finally drank a cup, and his cheeks were already slightly flushed. Principal Wang said, "I knew he couldn't drink." It was already past three o'clock, and the banquet was coming to an end. Only someone had to leave early due to other matters. I believe the host and guests enjoyed themselves and were extremely happy.</p>
<h3 id="e115">A Short Account of the Jinde Amusement Fair <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Gong</p>
<p>The Jinde Savings Society was initiated by gentlemen in Shanghai's gentry and business circles who advocated thrift and virtue. Initially, they rented a few simple houses to establish the society. The members were as few as morning stars. Before long, the society gradually developed, and the number of members increased daily. The original address was insufficient, so they relocated to larger houses several times. The public held an optimistic view of the society. After Mr. Chen Fukang was elected as the chief director, he devoted himself diligently to the management. With the support of his younger brother, Zenglin, and the old staff members, Li and Zheng, the society flourished even more. People from all walks of life joined like water flowing westward. As a result, they raised substantial funds to build their own premises on Laobaizi Road, Fusheng Road, occupying several acres of land with hundreds of rooms. Apart from allocating a portion for the Baixing Theater and Baixing Restaurant, there were many remaining rooms, divided into departments with orderly operations. In Shanghai, a city known for its extravagance, the society stood out for advocating thrift and virtue. Those with shallow views could not help but criticize it inwardly. The reason for its success was that it stood clean among the muddy, and things would inevitably revert to their opposite when they reached an extreme. Just like those who ate delicacies and fresh, fatty foods every day, they would inevitably find the taste of plain vegetables delightful when they occasionally had them. Yesterday, the society held a grand amusement fair specifically for expanding the physical education department. Hundreds of guests gathered together. The amusement program included the clear voices of Mr. Cai Defen, Mr. Tang Bolin, and Mr. Chen Fuli (Yang Cuixi), and the Jinde Orchestra's performance of Chinese music (General's Command, Farewell My Concubine). The zithers, pipa, and other musical instruments used were antique, elegant, and pleasing. Their cold sound was especially full of charm. Mr. Chen Taixun's Cantonese opera (Green Banana) had an excellent title, but I didn't understand the singing. As a native of Anhui, although I had worked with Cantonese people and my deceased wife, Ji Lanjiu, was from Guangdong, I only knew a little about ordinary Cantonese. However, I didn't understand Cantonese opera. The music used was also good, but I was outside the gate and couldn't name it. Ms. Xue Qian's Chinese martial arts were as swift as a rabbit and as agile as a soaring dragon. I, Dong Mei, am ashamed to face this female warrior. Mr. Zheng Laosheng and Mr. Wu Guanhua's Cantonese music dance was lively, humorous, and funny. I repeatedly burst into laughter. The Rose Society's magic show was incredibly clever with the ability to transform things on the spot. The act of sawing a living person in half was particularly astonishing. The fashion show featuring female stars Bai Meifang, Wang Meimei, Huang Lilin, Zhao Suqin, and Chen Ailun, with their fair skin, black eyebrows, and green makeup, arranged in groups of three or five, moving with light steps and swaying slender waists, was truly enviable. The harmonica performance by the Chinese Harmonica Society was able to create new sounds with children's toys, which was quite unexpected. Their march, with such small objects, simulated the galloping of thousands of troops, sometimes far and sometimes near, with clear distinctions in pitch, which could not be described as anything but a unique skill. Mr. Zhu Shiliang, Yang Nanying, Cao Zhenkang, Zhang Shiyang, Fang Yulin, Sun Junqing, Xia Pinpu, Wang Yiqing, Jin Runchu, Dai Baocheng, Lu Shaoan, and Tang Yunqing's Peking Opera performances, with their singing, acting, fighting, and martial arts, each excelled in their respective areas, which was not easy to come by from amateur performers. Yang Nanying's "Cosmic Front" was particularly commendable because a Fujianese singing Peking Opera, with his pronunciation and tone delivery, was surprisingly accurate and full of flavor, beyond my expectations. Moreover, he was an amputee (he was born without a right arm, and the one he supported in his sleeve was a prosthetic arm), so his performance should not have been worth watching. Unexpectedly, he drove the prosthetic arm as if it were a real hand, performing body movements such as wanting to ascend to the sky and enter the earth, which felt lively and natural, without any artificial traces. The most amazing thing was that the famous actor Yang Baosen did not appear on stage himself but played the qin for Nanying, without a single flaw from beginning to end, and followed the tune with perfect precision. Even an experienced qin player could not have surpassed him. This, along with Nanying's one-armed performance, could be called two great feats. The Ping Opera critic Zheng Guoyi followed Baosen closely, never leaving his side, which was what was called a special follower. Haha.</p>
<p>▲ Brief News: Cantonese singing and dancing star Violet recently arrived in Yindu (phonetic transliteration). The welcoming crowd was so enthusiastic that the entire city seemed to be in a frenzy. Violet, accompanied by her mother, Ms. Ma, visited her old comrades from the Tongmenghui and important figures of the National Government. She was so busy with social engagements that she had hardly any free evenings. When Mr. Tang, the manager of the National Grand Theater, heard about this, he invited her to perform on stage to entertain the people of the capital. Violet's trip to the capital was solely for sightseeing, and all her costumes and props were left in Shanghai. Therefore, she specially sent someone to Shanghai to take care of them. She will begin performing for three days starting on the 14th, featuring Cantonese operas such as "Mei Fei's Burial of Flowers" and "Chen Miaochang," as well as various dances. (Ru Jia)</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Preserving Youth with Secret Arts, Blurring Eyebrows with Dark Colors; Seeking Destiny without Method, Buying Swift Horses in the Golden Market</p>
<p>It turned out that Hua Yuanchun was a familiar figure in Jiangnan, and this Grandma Pan was also from Changshu. They were fellow villagers. Grandma Pan's husband was a famous actor in Shanghai named Pan Xiaoqiao. After Grandma Pan received the telegram, she had no choice. The person was already dead, and it was a long way from Shanghai to Beijing. The travel expenses alone would cost one or two hundred yuan. Even if she went, she would only see a coffin. So she wrote a quick letter, naturally thanking Third Young Master Ye for taking care of the funeral arrangements. Old Sixth had a life of hardship, but in the end, she met Third Young Master Ye, which could be considered a bit of luck in her ill-fated life. However, her coffin was left alone in the north, which seemed too pitiful. It would be best to find a way to bring her back to Shanghai. Although Hua Lao Liu had a short and unfortunate life, she was still a person of her time. To abandon such a beautiful woman in the desolate northern suburbs seemed somewhat inappropriate. After Ye Tonghou received the letter, he said, "If you're going to help Buddha, you have to help him all the way to the West." He decided to transport her coffin to Shanghai. Once it was in Shanghai, he couldn't take care of it anymore. Fortunately, Hua Lao Liu had her lovers and close sisters in Shanghai, and they would naturally do their part. Ye Tonghou had extensive connections and knew many people. He entrusted a friend from a transportation company to transport Hua Yuanchun's coffin from the train to Tianjin and then from Tianjin to Shanghai on a China Merchants Bureau steamer. This matter spread throughout the alleys of Beijing. Third Young Master Ye earned a reputation for chivalry, especially among the girls in the south and north, who all said that Third Young Master Ye had a good heart. Many guests who had been friends in the past later became strangers, abandoning her like discarded items. Moreover, everyone knew that Third Young Master Ye and Hua Lao Liu did not have any physical relationship, so this was indeed not easy. Readers should know that Ye Tonghou also died in Beijing later on. At that time, his situation was very difficult, and it was a sudden illness. It was just as he and Hua Lao Liu had said at the beginning, "I won't die in Beijing." At that time, the funeral arrangements were rushed, and several girls from the south who knew Ye San wanted to come forward to do the funeral arrangements for Ye Tonghou. Fortunately, Ye Tonghou had an uncle who was a government official in the Ministry of Education and said that it was not appropriate and declined everything. However, these girls still invited a high monk to chant scriptures for three days to help him ascend to heaven. Although it involved superstition, it showed their sincerity. Who said that people in the brothels are all unfeeling and disregard righteousness? The matter of Hua Yuanchun was finally concluded. However, there was still a small ripple. It turned out that when her coffin was transported to Shanghai, there was a small dispute because Grandma Pan and Hua Lao Liu were good sisters and knew that Hua Lao Liu had a pair of joyful enemies in Shanghai. They had to give them a message. So she reported to her two lovers as if sending out a funeral announcement.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Gold and Gold Prices Finally Rise <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Increase of Sixteen Taels and Seven Mace</p>
<p>Still Strong Fluctuations: Yesterday, March 17th, the gold price fell and then rose again, with strong fluctuations and an extremely complex market situation. A sudden storm was unavoidable. In the morning session, there was a difference of sixteen or seventeen taels. In the afternoon session, it reviewed at thirteen or fourteen taels, and then surged to twenty taels. Dealers' intentions turned from low to high, and large accounts covered short positions aggressively. Enquiries were active. Companies such as Chen Feng, Yongyuan, Shengsheng, Yuda, etc. were all buyers, while Yuanmao, Yongyong, Yongfengyuan, Tai, etc. all sold. Speculators initially exited and then entered. As for foreign exchange, it was loose and then tight, with quoted prices rising and then falling, resulting in a break-even. Overseas silver markets were still rising sharply, so the gold price initially plummeted by more than ten taels. Later, gold prices were weak and broke through 660 taels. After that, because the exchange rate was good and foreign merchants actively settled payments, and because large accounts were buying, the price quickly turned upwards, frequently rising by more than ten taels. By noon, it had already escaped the 70 tael mark. In the afternoon, Yuansheng, Hengxingyuan, and the Dalian gang, etc. were all pulling in, and the exchange rate seemed particularly strong, rising both openly and secretly, continuing to rise with the momentum of reaching the sky. Later, it exceeded 690 taels, and the speed of change was truly unexpected. It is said that the large bars may rise again this morning.</p>
<p>The Market Opened with a Sudden Drop: The price of May gold fell sharply by ten taels and eight mace from the opening price of 660 taels in the early morning because the large bars rose again by seven-sixteenths, the silver price rose by 1.125, and the US buying interest did not diminish, even adding one-sixteenth to the listed price to purchase, and private telegrams also increased by 1.125, and companies such as Shunli, Qianchang, Xiangwanxing, etc. in the market all sold. After that, there were two or three taels up and down, from fifty-eight taels to sixty-one taels, and then back to fifty-seven taels. Then, the British gold bank bought 14,875, and the US gold bank bought 34.125. Later, because Yu Dahangxingyuan, etc. bought, it has been pulled up by six taels, totaling sixty-three and a half taels. When the first order was revealed, it had risen by half a penny, and when the US gold fell by four and a half points, it retreated to sixty-one taels, but the domestic market was still buying 8125 in April and 75 in March from Japanese commercial banks, and then added to sixty-three taels and seventy-eight mace. Afterwards, the situation was weak because Dadongcheng, Yongfeng, Changsheng, Yongqianchang, Xiangtong, Taichang, Shunli, Wanxing, etc. tended to sell, and the British gold repurchase price was still 875, so the gold price fell by eight or nine taels, and at 10:00, it suddenly fell to fifty-five taels and two mace. Then, Chen Feng, Yong, etc. picked up British gold, and British-American tobacco companies settled payments, so the market atmosphere was weak and good, and Chen Feng, Yongxin, Yuancheng, Yongyu, Yuda, etc. in the market came in one after another. Tong Taichang then bought back, so the price stepped up into the clouds. After 10:30, it was sixty-seven or eight taels. Then some retail accounts sold, suppressing a small amount of three taels. At 10:45, there was a further rise. Yuan Cheng, Fu Chang, Hong Xing, Yong Ding, Chang, etc. all dragged in. At 11:00, it was seventy-one and a half taels. Yuan Mao Yong, etc. sold for sixty-seven taels and five quarters of an hour. Suddenly, it was heard that the British gold had changed and shrunk by 125, the US gold by 25, and the Japanese gold had increased by one point. At 11:40, the rise was seventy-one taels and eight mace. Suddenly, a sharp drop of more than seven taels, and Zhifeng Yongyuan, Maoyong, and other goods companies competed to sell. At 11:50, it was sixty-four and a half taels. After the recovery, the buyers were suddenly diligent, so the noon closing was seventy taels and five mace. It continued to be raised to more than seventy-two taels. The price was initially 713 taels and four mace, totaling fifty-three taels to forty-two and three mace. At noon, it was changed to 718 taels and two mace, totaling fifty-three or four taels to forty-seven or eight mace.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Frequently Stepped into the Clouds: The afternoon market opened at seventy-four taels. Later, because the Indian exchange rate repeatedly reported a fall and was bought by Wanxing, Shunli, Yuda, Yuancheng, Hengxingyuan, etc., it has exceeded eighty taels. At 2:30, the British gold changed and shrunk by 25, the US gold by half a yuan, and the Japanese gold increased by two points and two-fifths, so it rose to eighty-two taels and eight mace. After a moment, it retreated to seventy-nine and a half taels. After 2:30, the buying party exceeded Heng, and the British gold stepped up, and the bank bought 14,3125 to 25. At almost 3:15, the listed price shrunk again by 125, the US gold by 25, and the Japanese gold increased by 1.25, all shrinking back to the same as the day before. At 3:20, the rise was eighty-six taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had risen by seven anna. At that time, after twelve or thirteen minutes, it retreated to eighty taels and five yuan. Yuan Mao Yonghengxingyuan, Yongfeng, etc. also sold. After entering, it presented a high peak, and the buyers were very diligent, especially the British gold was only closed at 14,125. The bank ate more than 1875. Until the 4:30 closing, it was eighty-seven and a half taels. Compared with the previous day, it rose by sixteen taels and seven mace. After the close, the continuous rise has been raised to more than ninety-two taels, and the goods company is surging in. The maximum price in one day was eighty-seven taels and five mace, and the minimum price was fifty-five taels and two mace (in terms of listed prices). A total of twenty-two taels and three mace. It is unpredictable to look back. The morning market for goods was sixty-two taels, the noon closing was seventy-one taels, the afternoon was seventy-three taels, and the closing price was ninety-three taels. The listed price was initially 729 taels, totaling forty-six taels and seven mace, and then changed to 705 taels, totaling fifty taels to forty-seven or eight mace. The accounts were recorded at sixty-four taels in March, sixty-seven taels in April, and seventy taels in May in the morning, and seventy-eight taels in March, eighty-one taels in April, and eighty-five taels in May in the afternoon. The water subsidy was sixty-four taels in the morning and seventy-eight taels in the afternoon.</p>

Later, the gold market rose again, so it also turned up. Especially British and American tobacco companies and import traders all closed in. British gold was especially tight in the afternoon market.

<p>The general situation of the market: In the past few days, the tael market was strong because the Shantou gang purchased cash foreign money, but there was no significant increase. This time, the sales decline is loose, and it is appropriate for the tael price to fall.

<p>Foreign Cotton Rebounds: Spring Sales Are About to Move</p>
<p>The Yarn Market Continues to Be Strong and the Market Is Quite Strong. The Strength of the Manufacturers' Bearish Position Is Strong, Although There Is an Increasing Trend in the Bottom Goods, but Due to Cost Relations, Most Are Unwilling to Compromise and Sell. Therefore, the Large Batch Number Is Closed and Not Released. Only Retailers Sell According to the Environment and the Concentration of Inventory. Although Some Bad News Suddenly Fell Three or Four Times. Once the Situation Is Certain, It Suddenly Rises. At Present, the Period Is Still in the Spring Sales, and There Is Still Hope for Development in the Future. The Price of Three-Product Yarn Is High and Hard, and the Large Accounts Pay Special Attention to the Three-Month Standard Yarn. Therefore, It Is Expected That There Will Still Be an Upward Trend for the Time Being.</p>
<p>People's standard rises two taels, and foreigners' standard rises. The opening situation in the previous market was upward. The American cotton rebounded, and people were nervous. Each month rose by one tael, and the two or three markets rose even more. As a result, each month rose by 5.7 mace to 1 tael and 4.5 mace. The market for standard yarn was even tighter in the afternoon. It was heard that the gold market rose again, and each month rose by 7.9 mace to 1 tael and 45 mace.

<h3 id="e124">Cotton Market Turns to Stability <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has strengthened due to the upward trend of Indian and American cotton overseas, leading to positive sentiment. However, the price of silver continues to rise sharply, exceeding most expectations. There is hope for a turnaround in foreign cotton prices, resulting in slightly increased buying interest. However, the sales of existing cotton in the market are quite sluggish, with factories showing little activity. The spot market appears rather weak. As for the Japanese trading firm Toyo Cotton Company, there is a gradual inclination towards lower prices. Nevertheless, due to the thin inventory in this port, there is no immediate aggressive downward trend. The future direction will depend on the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Han Piao Advances: In the Han Piao market, the opening price was firm due to the rise in American cotton prices, although the silver price increased. During the session, the market sentiment remained firm, with prices rising by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan per month. In the afternoon, news of a sharp rise in gold prices tightened the market further, with prices rising by another 0.5 to 0.6 yuan per month. Total transactions amounted to 58,800 dan. Hengchang sold 3,500 dan, Changji 1,100 dan, Yuanda 2,600 dan, Yiyu 1,100 dan, Jinfeng 1,700 dan, Hengchang 1,200 dan, Xingyuan 3,000 dan, Jifeng Gongtai 2,700 dan, Shenda 1,700 dan, and Deji 2,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded as follows: Han Piao closing price changes and inventory: May 4035 (up 115), 766,000; March 4015 (up 65), 425,000; June 4020 (up 101), 934,000; April 4030 (up 90), 63,000; July 4030 (up 110), 793,000.</p>
<p>Spot Transactions Quiet: Spot transactions are quiet. Trading is sluggish. The factory has no intention to purchase. The source includes 113 bales of Tonghua cotton and 214 bales of Yaohua cotton, 42.00 yuan for Shaanxi cotton. The Shanghai factory purchased 200 pieces, with spot goods sent to the factory.</p>

<p>American Cotton Shorts Covering: Yesterday, American cotton strengthened due to positive news from Liverpool, strong support from Wall Street, and short covering. Futures rose by 20 to 24 points per pound, and spot prices rose by 20 points per pound. English cotton futures rose by 56 points, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 25 points. Indian cotton strengthened due to short covering. At closing, the market stabilized, with Pingguoer rising by 4 points per pound, forward contracts rising by 3 points per pound, and Omla and White Plain Creek near and far term contracts rising by 3 points per pound. The original telegraphic record is as follows (dated the 16th):</p>

<h3 id="e126">Grain and Rice Market Steps Up by Two or Three Jiao <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>At Zhabei yesterday, over twenty boats arrived from various regions. Buying interest from all sides was extremely strong. The price of white grain increased by two or three jiao due to the inactivity of loss conversion. Thin rice arrived sparsely and sold smoothly, with prices gradually increasing. Two-foot Yang Xian rice's price remained relatively firm due to sluggish market transactions. The situation for Duzi Xian rice and the port was stable, due to dissatisfaction with its digestibility. The trend of depreciation of the exchange rate is still active. High-quality goods are in short supply, with prices slightly increasing by half a chi in recent transactions. The opening price for loss conversion is 12.2 yuan.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai yesterday, over ten boats were seen arriving from the river. Traffic continued to be smooth. Changshu and Beiyin showed strong buying interest from various regions, with prices increasing by half a jiao. The guest interest and retail sales of Sutong white japonica rice were both good, and large transactions were also favorable by one jiao. High-quality early thin rice from the south route was quite tight, with prices increasing by about two jiao. General guest interest was weak, seeing a favorable increase of one jiao. The arrival of Yangdu rice was not plentiful, and sales seemed to be unsatisfactory. Prices followed an upward trend, close to one chi. White yuan goods were scarce, and the market was stagnant, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Standard Flour Market Rebounds <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the Standard Flour market in the morning, the market showed weakness in all months. Although the quotations from foreign markets rebounded by one, two, or three jiao, the environment remained unfavorable, and the price of gold also reported a heavy fall. Therefore, most people's sentiment remained weak. The prices for March, April, and May were slightly lower than the previous day by 0.01 fen, while the prices for June, July, and August all reached the 2.1 liang level. July even reached 1.9975 liang, indicating the weakness of market sentiment. However, the market sentiment suddenly changed after the opening of the market in the afternoon. With the sharp fall and then sharp rise in gold prices, temporary short positions rushed to cover their positions. Therefore, both near and far term contracts rebounded, with prices increasing by one or two fen from the morning's lowest price. However, from the perspective of recent bearishness, this partial rebound is still difficult to sustain. As a result, the price for the current month increased by 0.05 fen compared to the previous day, the price for April and May increased by 0.01 fen, and the price for June increased by 0.025 fen. The prices for July and August both increased by 0.05 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Wheat Futures Market Sees Diminished Selling Pressure <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the Wheat Futures market in the morning, the market did not show any positive signs in any month. Although the quotations for foreign wheat were favorable by one, two, or three jiao, the fixed price of spot wheat gradually decreased due to the lengthening of the exchange rate. The price of 3.91 liang from the previous day had already been traded, and it was heard that the opening price yesterday set a new lowest record. It was heard that the settled price of a certain factory was only 3.85 liang. Therefore, distant months such as June, July, and August all increased by nine qian. At that time, the traders' hedging reached over 200 trucks, falling three, four, or five fen compared to the previous day. However, due to the rebound in gold prices in the afternoon, market sentiment stabilized, and selling pressure also subsided slightly. Prices gradually rebounded in all months, but the overall trend was still not very good, with little hope for further improvement. As a result, the price for the current month was slightly lower than the previous day by 0.01 fen, the price for April remained unchanged, the price for May increased by 0.01 fen, and the prices for June, July, and August all remained unchanged.</p>

<p>The silk market still showed little improvement yesterday. Although the telegraphic transfer price from European and American Shanghai White Factories reported an increase, the gradually tightening exchange rate caused manufacturers to still suffer significant losses due to the low prices. It was difficult to sell, and only Blue Rock Peak advanced 20 packages of Shanghai White Factory warp, Ganli advanced 80 packages of Zhili dry warp, and Samsung, etc. advanced 15 packages of coarse yellow silk. The prices were all fixed at a flat rate.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Lush Tea Continues to Sell Well at Luzhuang <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of lush Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang continued to be brisk. Tongfu, Jinlong, Baochang, Fushi, and other firms all began to search for goods. The Russian Aid Society also slightly increased its interest. Total transactions in the city amounted to over 700 boxes. Zhenmei was sold at a top price of 68 liang, Gongzhu was sold at 30 liang, Mazhu was sold at 50 liang, and Xiumei was sold at 13 liang. The market prices were all unchanged compared to the previous day. However, with only over 10,000 boxes remaining in the market, the market has stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Piece Goods: Eastern Goods' Prices Plummet <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The market for cotton cloth from this factory has been depressed for days. The sharp fall in cotton yarn prices has prompted selling, leading to a downward trend. Prices are extremely chaotic, with distinctions between new and old goods. Among them, heavy-weight coarse cloth is relatively firm, with little downward movement. 16-yard Five Yuan Bao coarse twill is also quite firm due to the scarcity of spot goods. The rest are all weakening. Fine twill has fallen by about 0.01 yuan compared to before. Although fine cloth merchants are still searching for goods, it is difficult to reverse the trend. Caiqiu, Laba, Tongyanghe have all fallen to around 7.2 liang. 11-pound coarse cloth from Ewo is sold at 5.4 liang. 13-pound One Bullhead is the cheapest, sold at 5.9 liang. Ewo's blue striped bleached cloth and Gold Pagoda bleached cloth have all fallen.</p>
<p>Since the fall in the gold market, the price drop of Eastern and Western piece goods has been unprecedented. Western goods can still be maintained, while Eastern goods have plummeted. Straight Tribute Serge, Fine Drill, Zhongshan Serge, etc., have fallen by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per day. The reason is that the sharp fall in the Eastern exchange rate has made Osaka's prices lower than Shanghai's. Merchants from Tianjin, Shantou, and Yunnan are no longer purchasing in Shanghai. Merchants from Sichuan and Hankou are unanimously watching, while only merchants from Changsha and Jiangxi are slightly replenishing their stocks. The price of Lake Heart Pavilion Drill has fallen by 0.32 yuan. Old Pattern Straight Tribute Serge 0.365 yuan. Half Moon Goose fine cloth has fallen by one liang compared to the beginning of the month, sold at 9.25 liang yesterday. Bleached cloth has also fallen.</p>

<p>Urgent Need to Promote Huachou and Xiabu: Zhang Weicheng, the Consul-General stationed in Korea, who has reported on the handling of negotiations over the past year, stayed at the Ongzhou Hotel on Lafayette Road while passing through Shanghai on his way to Beijing. Yesterday, he spoke to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency about the commercial situation between China and Korea, as well as the situation of overseas Chinese. The annual trade volume between China and Korea is about 155 million yuan, with products from the three northeastern provinces accounting for the majority, accounting for eight-tenths of the total. In the past, silk was an important export item, but it has almost disappeared in the last two or three years because the Japanese government stipulated that the tax rate for Japanese silk transported to Korea was only 8%, while the tax rate for Chinese silk transported to Korea was as high as 100%. Although the new tariff agreement has reduced the tax to 70%, the difference is still large. However, Koreans are well aware that Chinese silk is durable. No matter how Japanese silk imitates Chinese silk patterns, Koreans' trust in Japanese silk is still not as good as their trust in Chinese silk. Therefore, Chinese silk merchants should seize the opportunity of this tariff reduction to quickly catch up and try to transport and sell silk to continue the previous status of Chinese silk in Korea. Otherwise, in another three or four years, Koreans will not know that there is Chinese silk, and the sales of Chinese silk in Korea will be permanently cut off. In addition, summer cloth is a common item for Koreans to wear, and China can also try to promote it. Currently, there are self-operated shipping lines from Yantai to Korea, and transportation is also more convenient. I have advised the shipping company to further expand to help Chinese and Korean businesses achieve mutual assistance and development. There are a large number of overseas Chinese in Korea. Since the ban on farmers and workers from Japan going to Korea was lifted after negotiations, more people have been going from the three northeastern provinces and Shandong. Koreans have a very good feeling towards China. Koreans feel that the cost of living in Korea is high, and the number of people moving to China in recent years is also very considerable. It is said that Mr. Zhang will go to Beijing tonight and stay in Beijing for about four or five days. He must return to Shanghai for a trip. His reception hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e138">French Aviators Still Did Not Arrive Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Landed in Shantou En Route: The two French aviators, Bairdan and Manez, who are flying a Farman monoplane on a long-distance flight from Paris to Tokyo, were stranded in Hong Kong for two days due to heavy fog. Yesterday morning, the weather in Hong Kong had still not improved, but the French aviators decided not to delay any longer and took off from Hong Kong at 9:40 a.m. yesterday, risking their flight to Shanghai. Upon hearing the news, the French Consulate General and Chinese and foreign journalists in the city went to Hongqiao Airport to welcome them. Responsible personnel from the Aviation Administration and the Municipal Public Security Bureau also arrived at the airport to take care of the situation. French Consul General Coglin, Chief of the Political Department of the French Police Station Shao Chengziqing, and several French priests were all at Hongqiao Airport to welcome them. According to news from the French Consulate General, the French aviators were expected to arrive around 6:30 p.m. However, at that time, the northeast wind was very strong and the sky was overcast. Although the welcoming people knew that the French aviators had departed from Hong Kong, they were doubtful whether they could fly to Shanghai in such bad weather. After waiting for a long time until late in the evening at 6:00 p.m., the French Consulate General received a telegram from Shantou that the French aviators had finally been forced to land in Shantou due to weather conditions. The welcomers at Hongqiao Airport received a telephone notification from the French Consulate General and returned disappointed. If the weather improves today, the French aviators can fly to Shanghai from Shantou this afternoon. It is also heard that whether the French aviators will fly to Nanjing or Beiping after arriving in Shanghai is still under negotiation, otherwise, they may go to Tokyo via Shenyang or Korea.</p>

Northbound flights depart from Nanjing at 8:30 a.m., arrive in Xuzhou at 10:30 a.m., depart from Xuzhou at 10:40 a.m., arrive in Jinan at 12:30 p.m., depart from Jinan at 12:40 p.m., arrive in Tianjin at 2:35 p.m., depart from Tianjin at 2:45 p.m., and arrive in Beijing at 3:30 p.m. Southbound flights depart from Beijing at 8:00 a.m., arrive in Tianjin at 8:45 a.m., depart from Tianjin at 8:55 a.m., arrive in Jinan at 10:50 a.m., depart from Jinan at 11:00 a.m., arrive in Xuzhou at 12:50 p.m., depart from Xuzhou at 1:00 p.m., and arrive in Beijing at 3:10 p.m.</p>
<p>One-Way and Round-Trip Fares: The company has set the one-way and round-trip fares for the Beijing-Ping route. The one-way fare from Beijing to Beijing is 150 yuan, and the round-trip fare is 225 yuan. The one-way fare from Beijing to Xuzhou, Jinan, or Tianjin is 44 yuan per station, and the round-trip fare is 60 yuan. The one-way fare from Tianjin to Beijing is 18 yuan, and the round-trip fare is 27 yuan. The prices are subject to approval by the board of directors.</p>
<p>He Jiwu's Talk: A reporter from Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. He Jiwu, the general manager of the company, yesterday to inquire about his views on the aviation plan. Mr. He replied that people who have not traveled by plane consider air travel to be dangerous. Once they have traveled by plane, they find it unremarkable, and the time savings for passengers are considerable. At first glance, the fare seems higher than traveling by train, but it should be understood that time is money. The company is very strict in reviewing drivers and personnel. All Chinese and foreign technicians hired for each aircraft must be reviewed by the aviation group director Smith to ensure that they have considerable driving experience before they can be employed. The official Beijing-Ping aviation service will be implemented on April 1st. The company plans to expand its routes to develop its business. After the Beijing-Ping route is opened, it will prepare the Shanghai-Guangdong route. After that, it will gradually extend to the South Pacific Islands. In January, it will actively train Chinese aviation technicians and those interested in practicing aviation technology in preparation for future needs and for the provision of subsidies. The training director will be Smith.</p>

<p>Strictly Handle Registration Procedures: Order to Know How to Write Election Tickets: The Shanghai Municipal Election Office for National Assembly Representatives is very busy working these days as its election business has been quite crowded for some time. Many groups have submitted registers, which are currently being reviewed for eligibility. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted the association's constitution, brief biographies of officers, membership rosters, and other documents to the office. However, it was found that the items such as the length of time each member has been engaged in the industry were not filled in on the submitted membership roster. The office believes that it does not comply. It was also found that the membership roster submitted by the Chamber of Commerce to the Social Bureau in June of the nineteenth year listed 143 trade associations and 13 store members. Now, according to the submitted membership roster, there are 158 trade associations and 25 store members. All members who have joined later should be reported to the Social Bureau by the Chamber of Commerce for filing before they can take effect. The office has ordered compliance. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the General Office stating that the civil affairs offices of each province, the general supervisors, and the election supervisors of each municipal government should be informed that if the electors of each local group are unable to write their own election tickets, they may be written by personnel designated by the election supervisor, but the election supervisor should sign or stamp them to avoid irregularities. Please comply with the instructions of the General Office. It is also heard that the office has already printed two kinds of publications, "Election Guidelines" and "A Few Points That Citizens of This City Should Know About the National Assembly," with detailed content. If all sectors want to obtain copies, they can send personnel directly to the office to obtain them.</p>

All parties enthusiastically donated and have raised more than 200,000 yuan. He is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow with Kang Jiyao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Affairs Association, to attend the National Relief Affairs Conference to report on the details of the Shaanxi disaster. At the same time, as representatives of disaster victims from various counties in Shaanxi Province have successively arrived in Beijing to petition, Li Hanzhi, the director of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Affairs Association's office in Beijing, came to Shanghai yesterday to contact Zhu. Therefore, Zhu and others will stay in Beijing for several days and may come to Shanghai again to raise donations or go directly from Beijing to Ping and then to Xi'an to handle relief affairs. It will be decided after consulting with all parties today. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao hosted a banquet for all executive committee members of the Chinese Merchants' Cigarette Industry Association at Gongdelin last night.

He described the tragic situation of corpses not being buried and being found everywhere, which was unbearable to listen to. Cha Mianzhong, Ting Sheng, and others discussed fundraising methods and agreed to do their best to solicit donations, distributing donation registers on the spot to facilitate separate efforts.

<h3 id="e144">Price Increase for Yangtze River Steamer Alliance <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Merchants' Opposition: A Statement to Shanghai Shipping Merchants Regarding the Yangtze River Six Companies' Business Alliance and Fare Increase, which has aroused universal opposition from the Hankou Customs Brokers, who denounce it as humiliating the nation and forfeiting its rights. Shanghai's Chinese merchant ships view business cooperation and the recovery of navigation rights as two separate matters, with the latter being more eagerly anticipated by the Chinese shipping community. It is unrealistic to expect two or three Chinese ships to shoulder this heavy responsibility. Therefore, yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Peh Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, and other companies jointly decided to send a reply telegram to the Hankou Customs Brokers Association, detailing the discussion on the recovery of navigation rights and business cooperation. This matter is of great importance and is recorded in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Freight Rates Increased: Since the proposal for business cooperation among the Yangtze River Six Companies, the specific method of profit sharing has not yet been determined, so it is still under negotiation. However, implementation is inevitable, merely a matter of time. Regarding fare increases, a preliminary agreement has been reached, and starting yesterday, all six companies have uniformly increased rates. In addition to abolishing shallow water fees, all cargo rates have been increased by about 30%. Freight rates for both upstream and downstream cargo will be charged at the new prices. The reason for the increase is not due to cooperation, but rather the substantial increase in expenses due to gold price increases, making it a necessity given the circumstances. Merchants in Shanghai have already been paying the new rates.</p>
<p>Hankou Merchants Oppose: Upon hearing about the cooperation and fare increase by the Six Companies, the Hankou Customs Brokers Association held a special meeting to oppose it. The Yangtze River Six Steamship Companies were considered by China, England, and Japan to be a move by Chinese shipping merchants to accommodate foreigners. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the central government requesting a ban, and another telegram was sent to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Peh Steam Navigation Company, and Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, stating that the Six Companies' business alliance was humiliating the nation and forfeiting its rights, harming both merchants and civilians. Details have been submitted to the central government for review, requesting a halt to its progress. Sincerely, Hankou Customs Brokers Association.</p>
<p>The Three Companies' Reply: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, and San Peh Steam Navigation Company have consulted multiple times on this matter and drafted a reply telegram, which was sent out yesterday. It roughly stated: "Your telegram has been received. We have investigated that the Six Companies' agreement on fare prices is an old practice from the past, the main purpose of which is to avoid competition among peers and follow market customs, just as your association regards the registration of foreign ships as a common practice. There is no evil intent to harm Chinese merchants or forfeit national rights. If your association truly believes that the joint pricing of Chinese and foreign shipping merchants is inappropriate, then you should guarantee that all Chinese merchants unite and completely refuse to load foreign ships, which would be the right approach. However, now that foreign ships operating within the country have become dominant, their capital is abundant, and they can compete fiercely, which cannot be matched by two or three Chinese shipping companies. Therefore, to address the root of the problem, it is necessary to recover navigation rights and support the domestic shipping industry. While support still largely depends on the government's efforts, it also relies on the collective efforts of various merchant groups to provide mutual assistance and safeguard the industry. This time, Chinese and foreign shipping merchants are combining due to circumstances. If our patriotic merchants can unite firmly and happily choose Chinese shipping, refusing to load foreign ships, then those foreign ships with abundant capital and strength will also be helpless and unable to exert their skills. Otherwise, temporary competition and sacrifices will only lead to the destruction of domestic shipping and the profiteering of unscrupulous merchants, which will not contribute to national sovereignty or the interests of the people. Moreover, at a time when gold prices are soaring and expenses are increasing sharply, if foreign ships are not constrained by Chinese ships, their fare increases will not stop at these levels. Therefore, looking to the future, if there are no two or three Chinese shipping companies mediating, foreign ships in China will become more rampant in their monopolistic control. The harm to our Chinese merchants and the humiliation of our national rights will be unimaginable. If your association has sound and concrete plans for maintaining Chinese shipping and safeguarding national rights, our company is willing to be instructed. We do not know how your association will guide us."</p>

<p>French Ship Aground: According to news from the French Consulate in Shanghai, the French postal ship "Yangtze" was sailing between Vietnam and Shanghai. Yesterday, while passing through the waters off Zhejiang Province, the ship ran aground on a reef at Bei Yu Shan (transliteration). It is reported that all cargo is safe. Upon learning of this, the French Consulate immediately ordered a French warship to communicate with the stranded postal ship via radio and arrange for rescue.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Accident: The Sixth Shen Sheng Maru of the Japanese Dalian Shen Sheng Steamship Company, which was transporting coal from Hongji to Shanghai, encountered fog on the morning of the 14th in the South Sea Strait and ran aground on a reef. The bottom of the ship was breached, and seawater has flooded the deck. The crew and sailors are still missing. A Japanese fishing boat is on site to provide rescue. It was reported yesterday that many items on board have been looted by pirates. The Japanese warship "Uji," which was in Guangdong, has sailed to the area to rescue and search for the crew.</p>
<p>Chang Xing Damaged: The San Peh Company's Chang Xing ship was loading cargo at the company's wharf in the southern city yesterday when the Ning Shao ship returned to Shanghai from the Yangtze River and docked at the wharf. Due to strong winds and waves, the ship was impacted by the waves and collided with the Chang Xing ship. The outer hull of the Chang Xing's front cabin was damaged, and the iron plates were destroyed. Fortunately, it was above the waterline. The company was immediately notified to send personnel to inspect and repair it. The ship sailed to Hankou as usual this morning.</p>

This year, the 20,000-ton giant ship "Lissaro" has been assigned, carrying a world travel group of over 300 people. It is coming from New York via Europe to Shanghai. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that the ship has arrived in Hong Kong and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month. After staying in Shanghai for one day, it will sail to Japan, cross the Pacific Ocean, and return to the United States.</p>

<p>Plaintiff's Attempt at Reconciliation Fails: The Deceased's Wife Reports to the Seamen's Union. The Daily News reports: After the May 30th Massacre in the fourteenth year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1925], all sectors of society responded with fervor. The Shanghai seamen planned a strike to provide assistance, but it was obstructed by Wang Zhongqing, the head of the "living fire" contractor. The strike committee, on the afternoon of June 6th at 1:00 PM, ordered seaman Zheng Zhensheng to assassinate Wang Zhongqing at No. 2009 Xinji Bang Road to ensure the strike would be successful. The assassination failed, and Zheng was arrested and sent to the joint court for trial. He was sentenced to five years and sent to the Western Prison. Zheng's wife, Mrs. Chai, petitioned for probation and filed appeals, but to no avail. When the National Revolutionary Army won the Northern Expedition and established its capital in Nanjing, Zheng Zhensheng managed to send a letter from prison and dispatched someone to see Shao Lizi and Ye Chucang, requesting their assistance. The Seamen's Union also petitioned the central government to redress the injustice. The official documents that went back and forth were numerous, but the release was delayed. Last autumn, the five-year term expired, but Zheng remained imprisoned. The Seamen's Union again petitioned the central government to demand his release, but it was not carried out. On the 3rd of this month, Zheng's family suddenly received a notice from the Western Prison stating that Zheng Zhensheng had died on the 25th of last month. The coffin containing the body has been placed in the Ningbo Guild Hall at the North Station. Soon after, Wang Zhongqing, the plaintiff, sent someone to negotiate with Zheng's wife, Mrs. Chai, offering to pay her 40 yuan per month as a form of reconciliation until Zheng's son reached the age of sixteen, at which point the payments would cease. Mrs. Zheng refused and reported to the Seamen's Union, requesting redress. The Seamen's Union held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided to again petition the central government to open Zheng Zhensheng's coffin for examination to verify the circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Case of a Worker Injured by White Russian at Aid Organization <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Declaration from the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association of Workers at the French Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>The Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association of Workers at the French Water and Electricity Company issues a public announcement to all sectors of society regarding the tragic case of Liu Jinshan, a worker at the Lomeck Sugar Factory: Beloved workers, respected members of all sectors of society, a shocking and outrageous tragedy occurred at 8:30 AM on the 11th of this month at the Lomeck Sugar Factory, which is owned by White Russian capitalists on Da Xi Road. The incident was caused when a White Russian named Miliuosike, who was employed by the factory, took a wiping cloth that worker Liu Jinshan had washed. When worker Liu asked to see it, this White Russian, who was usually directed and favored by the factory owner, had been oppressing and bullying workers for more than a day. At this time, he punched worker Liu violently in the ear several times. Worker Liu was seriously injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and losing consciousness. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for examination. According to the hospital report, his eardrum was ruptured, his auditory nerve was severed, and his brain was injured, endangering his life. If worker Liu dies, he leaves behind an elderly mother in her sixties with white hair and a young wife with two children under the age of five, all of whom depend on worker Liu to provide for them with the money he earns from his blood and sweat. The assailant has directly injured worker Liu personally and indirectly harmed his entire family. The cries of the elderly mother for her son, the young wife for her husband, and the two children for their father are unbearable to hear. This situation is intolerable! The White Russian has been arrested by the police, and the court has scheduled a hearing for the 20th of this month. The factory workers are unanimously indignant. Worker Liu is a fellow-provincial from Hubei, and the workers from the same province at the sugar factory and his family came to our association to explain the circumstances. Upon hearing this, the workers at our association were extremely saddened and angered. The White Russian capitalists used cruel means to violently assault our worker. Alas, our worker was killed without reason at the factory. Since this dark and tragic incident has occurred, all our beloved workers and members of all sectors of society are heartbroken. This is not only a matter for our fellow-provincial worker from Hubei, but it is a personal tragedy for all workers in Shanghai. Our association solemnly declares to all labor unions, workers, and members of all sectors of society, demanding that we unite and strive to uphold human rights, expel the White Russians, and protect the safety of all workers in Shanghai. Our association proposes: (1) The factory owner must immediately compensate worker Liu for all losses. If there are any accidents, the capitalist should provide compensation and wait for further discussion on the arrangements. (2) We demand a guarantee of safety in the future to prevent similar incidents from occurring. (3) The assailant and the Lomeck factory owner who condoned the violence must be immediately punished. (4) We will initiate the organization of a support association for the Liu case. (5) The White Russians must be expelled from the factory. The above are the minimum measures, and we must unite and strive to the end. This is our announcement.</p>

<p>The National Cotton Production Improvement and Statistics Conference continued its second general meeting at 8:00 AM yesterday, with over 50 representatives attending. Yang Xiandong chaired the meeting, and Ji Zifeng served as the recorder. The afternoon session began at 1:30 PM, chaired by Lu Feishu, with Chu Xiusheng and Zheng Huainian serving as recorders. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reports: In the morning, representatives from Xidu Huan Tang, Jiangxi Zhang Yinqing, and Anhui Wang Jiqu, and in the afternoon, representatives from Jiangsu Hu Jingliang and Zhejiang Wu Weijing, reported on the cotton production, yield, quality, and other conditions of cotton farming in their respective provinces, as well as plans for improvement.</p>
<p>Speeches: In the morning, Mr. Sun Yushu spoke on the topic of "The Preservation of Purebred Varieties in the Promotion of Cotton Seeds." He emphasized three points for maintaining the purity of seeds: (1) using administrative methods for agricultural promotion; (2) using educational methods; and (3) hoping for public assistance in development. Regarding the promotion aspect, he suggested paying attention to: (1) demonstration cotton fields; (2) seeking guidance from agricultural households for teaching; and (3) increasing interest in seed selection to encourage it. In the afternoon, speakers included: (A) Mr. Feng Zhaochuan, who spoke on "Several Important Issues in Cotton Seed Improvement," with four main points: (1) studying the heredity of cotton crops; (2) the problem of natural cross-pollination in cotton crops; (3) breeding methods; and (4) fertilization management methods for cotton crops. (B) Mr. Chen Yanshan spoke on "The Origin, Process, and Hope for the 'Million' Variety of Cotton Developed by Jin Da": (1) It originated in the seventh year of the Republic [of China, i.e., 1918] when an American plant physiologist came to China to investigate and promote it, with the support of the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association. (2) The seeds of the "Million" cotton variety were brought to Wusong by Guo Renfeng in the eighth year of the Republic [of China, i.e., 1919]. The results were long fibers, strong luster, few impurities, and the ability to spin up to 42-count yarn. (3) He hoped that everyone could find even better seeds.</p>
<p>Two Review Committees: A total of 76 proposals were received for this conference by the 16th. The preliminary meeting decided to divide them into improvement and statistics groups. The improvement group elected Sun Yushu, Chen Yanshan, Li Lubin, Fang Junqiang, Zhang Zemin, Yuan Zhongyuan, Hu Pingchu, Zhao Lianfang (who resigned and was replaced by Feng Zhaochuan), and Ye Yuanding as the nine members of the proposal review committee for the improvement group. Sun Yushu convened the committee. The statistics group elected Jiang Dixian, Du Huan Tang, Liu Shushu, Wu Weijing, Chen Bingquan, Wang Jinwu, and Jiang Han Luo as the members of the compilation and review committee. Wang Jinwu convened the committee. The improvement group began reviewing the proposals the night before, merging 14 cases into four. The review of each case continued last night. The statistics group began reviewing last night.</p>
<p>Today's Agenda: The meeting will open at 9:00 AM today. Fang Junqiang will speak on "Rational Promotion." After the speech, the discussion on proposals (improvement group) will begin.

<h3 id="e150">Meeting of the Silk Factory Industry Relief Committee <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Methods of Distributing Debt</p>
<p>The Special Committee for the Relief of the Silk Factory Industry in the Three Regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai held a plenary committee meeting yesterday (the 17th) at 3:00 PM at the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association. Those present included Shen Yichen, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Xuanzeng, Zhu Mouxian, Huang Jinfan, and ten others. Shen Yichen was elected as chairman. After formal greetings, the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting, and then the representatives who went to Beijing to petition for the second time reported on the petition process in Beijing. Chu Xuanzeng then spoke, saying that the matter of issuing silk public bonds was entrusted to him and Wang Xiaolai to petition in Beijing. He went to Beijing twice. For the second time, because Representative Wang was ill, Shen Yichen was appointed as the representative. He first visited the Ministers of Industry and Finance, and then hosted banquets for the members of the Executive and Legislative Yuan, as well as the Ministers of Finance and Industry, and other officials. He clearly stated the urgent situation of the silk factory industry, requesting that the original plan to issue 8 million yuan in bonds to provide relief be maintained. However, the plan has already been announced and implemented, making it difficult to change. The members and Minister Kong recognized that the European sales of the factories have weakened recently, and manufacturers are suffering heavy losses, which will lead to complete bankruptcy. The need for relief is urgent and cannot be delayed. Removing the expenses for improving mulberry trees and other things from the 6 million yuan in bond funds is not enough for distribution. They should show sympathy. As a result, they agreed to wait for our industry to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance and Industry, which will then be forwarded to the Executive and Legislative Yuan for review and approval to increase the bond amount. However, the procedure is very tight. Submitting requests through various channels takes time. The fastest would be three to four weeks before it can be announced and implemented. Next, the method of distributing the amount was discussed. Everyone agreed that the previously determined method of distributing according to the amount of silk in storage was no longer applicable due to time constraints. The best way would be to distribute according to the number of silk reeling machines, so that it would be fair and there would be no fraud. Regarding the organization of the public debt distribution committee, the court and ministry would send three people, the silk factory industry would send three people, and three people familiar with the silk industry would be hired, for a total of nine people to form the committee. It was decided to reserve this matter for discussion at the next committee meeting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Shanghai Native Bank Association Notifies the National Industry <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Please Unanimously Advocate for a Separate Native Bank Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Native Bank Association, due to the difficulty of implementing the Banking Law, has already petitioned various agencies of the National Government to enact a separate Native Bank Law. Yesterday, it specially notified the industry across the country, stating: "We respectfully inform you that our Native Bank industry has a long history of circulating funds and supporting various industries, bearing a large task. This was true in the past, and it is even more so now. The reason why it has progressed repeatedly without failure is that it relies on an organization that is suitable for national conditions and the habit of strictly adhering to credit, which is known to the public. Now, we read in the newspaper that the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan states in the final clause of the first article that 'those who operate one of the aforementioned businesses but do not call themselves banks are considered banks.' This means that our Native Bank industry is subordinate to banks. Furthermore, detailed translations of the various articles are not in accordance with the organization, customs, and business methods of our industry, or even contradict them greatly. If we do not comply, we will be suspected of violating the law. If we reluctantly comply, we will suffer hardship. Therefore, a meeting was held to resolve to petition the Central Political Council of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chairman of the National Government, the Presidents of the Executive and Legislative Yuan, and the Ministers of Industry and Finance to carefully consider the situation and enact a separate Native Bank Law for compliance. However, this matter is of great importance, and our industry shares common interests. We should respond as quickly as possible. We have enclosed a draft for your review. We hope that you will use your insights to make requests in unison, so that the government will adopt them and establish a foundation for the Native Bank industry."</p>

<p>Please Limit Price Increases to First and Second Class Tickets</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wired the Ministry of Railways, stating: "Ministry of Railways, Nanjing. Recently, we heard that your ministry, in order to repay the principal and interest on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, as well as the increased costs of materials due to the value of gold, is considering increasing passenger ticket prices by 20% to compensate for the losses, and it is scheduled to be implemented on March 16th. We believe that clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life. Recently, due to the value of gold, the costs of clothing, food, and housing, whether directly or indirectly from abroad, have been gradually increasing. As the newspapers have reported, it is difficult for ordinary people to find ways to make ends meet. The impact of the value of gold is a widespread phenomenon in society. The only difference is that public institutions can find other ways to supplement their funds, while ordinary people struggle to cope. Your ministry understands the hardship of the people. Once the affiliated associations make representations on their behalf, you should take it to heart. Moreover, the two railways are located in the center of industry and commerce. Due to the abnormal development of the city, many poor people from the interior flock to the city to make a living. The continuous flow of passengers has invisibly increased the benefits of the railway. There is no need to compensate by increasing prices. Even if public institutions suffer excessive losses and need to increase passenger ticket prices to make up for part of the losses, the situation of passengers traveling in third-class carriages is as described above. If transportation costs increase at the same time as the prices of clothing, food, and housing increase, the livelihoods of ordinary people will be more difficult, and society will become more chaotic. Therefore, the 35th Standing Committee Meeting of our association decided to request your ministry to increase the prices of first and second-class passenger tickets and to exempt third-class ticket prices to benefit the people. We respectfully present this case and request your consideration and approval for implementation."</p>

<p>Report and Investigate What the Masses Have Gained</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Union received a dispatch from the Ministry of Industry, stating: "The report on the expansion of overseas trade and the opening of national goods sales markets is awaiting merchants to go abroad for investigation in order to make contact. This time, the union gathered factory representatives to form a Nanyang industry inspection team. Since leaving the country, the chambers of commerce in the ports where they have arrived have reported on the warm welcome and banquets. It can be seen that the inspection team has been warmly welcomed by the overseas Chinese in Nanyang and is deeply appreciated. However, it is found that the inspection team was originally intended to promote national goods. Now that they have returned to Shanghai, the union should be informed to inform the inspection team to quickly report the needs of the overseas merchants in each port, which national goods are expected to be sold in each overseas port, and how to determine the direction for actively planning the export. Report the findings of the investigation in detail for investigation."</p>

<p>Instructing Accountant Pan Xulun</p>
<p>Ordinary stores are not allowed to engage in savings without authorization. The Ministry of Industry has issued repeated orders to prohibit it. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has issued separate orders to firms engaged in savings to immediately stop accepting funds and return all funds to depositors. However, the organization of savings by various companies and firms is different, and the circumstances of the closure are also different. Five methods have been stipulated and recorded in this newspaper. The Bureau of Social Affairs has now instructed Pan Xulun, a specially appointed accountant from the Lixin Accounting Firm in the city, to go to the World Book Company and the Youhua Banking Company to conduct a detailed inspection and clarify the following points: (1) detailed amount of various savings; (2) use of savings; (3) balance sheet of assets and liabilities; (4) the actual situation of the closure. Accountant Pan Xulun is scheduled to go to the World Book Company and the Youhua Banking Company today, together with the assistants Gu Xun and Qian Naiheng, to begin the work.</p>

<p>Has Been Delivered by the Bureau of Social Affairs to Four Lawyers, Including Wu Jingxiong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Riye Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department are part of the business of the Gongfa Company. Since the suspension of business and liquidation, the responsible government agency has thoroughly investigated the shareholder and director lists of the Gongfa Company and ordered them to bear unlimited liability for the repayment of savings. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has received the relevant books and records from the former Huang Chujiu Aftermath Committee, sent by Committee Member Yu Qiaoji. The bureau believes that the voluntary lawyers have now represented the majority of poor depositors and participated in the lawsuit. If necessary, they may have to pursue repayment from various shareholders. Therefore, the original documents have been sent to four lawyers, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Tingrui, Qin Liankui, and Jiang Yiping, for legal action.</p>

<p>Now Handled by the Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<p>The quality of silkworm seeds greatly affects the silk industry, so inspection is necessary. Previously, this inspection was handled by the Silkworm Seed Inspection Institute established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. Later, the ministry was ordered to merge the Silkworm Seed Inspection Institute under its jurisdiction, and the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau followed the order to take over and continue the work. The bureau had already notified the Jianghai Customs that imported silkworm seeds from abroad must be inspected and certified before being allowed to be imported. As for domestic silkworm seeds, the season for silkworm rearing is approaching, and the silkworm seeds need to be distributed urgently. Various silkworm seed manufacturers, such as Wuben, Banqiao, Taiping, and Central in Nanjing, have successively submitted requests for instructions. The Ministry of Industry approved that all silkworm seed inspection matters in Shanghai and Nanjing should be handled by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. The bureau has now appointed Li An, director of the silkworm seed inspection section of the raw silk inspection department, to lead technicians Yin Liangrong and others to the various manufacturing plants in Nanjing to carry out inspection work.</p>

<p>Separate Payments Issued</p>
<p>The Japanese firm, Kawato Company, owed over three thousand yuan in wages to the crew members, including captain Bu Nienting and Pan, of the shipping vessel Changfeng. Furthermore, five hundred and seventy yuan was due for severance pay as contracts expired, plus a security deposit of one thousand yuan. The Seamen's Union intervened and successfully ensured the full amount was paid. Lin Zhenquan and Guan Shiquan, two drivers on the same vessel, had a dispute over money, which the union also resolved by ordering the chief driver to compensate the second driver one hundred and fifty yuan. Unpaid wages for stevedores and midshipmen are still under negotiation, with hopes for a satisfactory resolution.</p>

<p>Telegram to Shanghai Raising Emergency Relief Funds for Shaanxi Disaster: Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Accounting Committee of the National Government requesting implementation of reward regulations, stating the Shaanxi disaster is unprecedented. (Omission) Initiating this association to raise donations, central support and encouragement are necessary to promote virtue. Donors may not necessarily seek empty praise, but since this concerns government relief efforts to save people from disaster, such commendations are indispensable. A resolution was passed to follow the Accounting Committee's regulations for awarding contributions to disaster relief funds. For donations and fundraising efforts meeting the committee's requirements, awards will be given. After results are finalized, graded registers will be sent for review and awarding. A special telegram was sent to ensure readiness.</p>
<p>Telegram from Shanghai to the Temporary Emergency Relief Fund for Shaanxi Disaster: Yesterday, the Shanghai Relief Fund received three telegrams from the Shaanxi Provincial Accounting Committee thanking and urging the purchase of public bonds and reporting on the disaster situation: (1) Zhihao Shanzhang conveyed by Yu Xiao Chang, forwarded by Mr. Yin Tiefu, acknowledged the establishment of an emergency relief fund in Shanghai and the Chamber of Commerce's proposal to urge the purchase of public bonds. This benevolent act is admired throughout the nation. On behalf of the 5,580,000 disaster-stricken people of Shaanxi, we express our sincere gratitude and best wishes. (2) According to a report from the Wugong County Accounting Branch, the drought in Wugong is severe; fields lie barren, weeds do not grow, and corpses remain unburied, with the populace at the very brink of disaster, awaiting relief day and night. The spring sun activates the spread of pestilence, leaving people awaiting death, hunger, and rescue. Please urgently send large sums to aid in recovery. (3) According to the report from Li Zhencheng, a representative of disaster victims in Lanzui County, the drought has persisted for years, compounded by banditry. In the spring of the previous year, bandits Chen Ding'an and Han led over three thousand bandits who engaged in arson and murder for eighteen months. Over one hundred villages throughout the county were attacked, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands and the burning of more than six thousand homes. Unable to cultivate for two years, the area has become a scorched earth. Returning disaster victims have no clothing, food, or shelter, and the seeds necessary for future harvest are also absent, leaving them facing utter devastation. Please allocate relief funds urgently for rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Japanese Fishing Vessels Using False Identification Numbers Seized <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Iced Fish Has Become Rotten and Unfit for Consumption</p>
<p>Two Vessels Fined One Thousand Yuan, Two Vessels Confiscated</p>
<p>The Japanese fishing vessels No. 12 and No. 13, both named "Daiichi Daisei Maru," attempted to deceive authorities by using falsified identification numbers to enter and exit the Jianghai Customs area. Patrol officers (commonly known as "yellow boats") stationed at the Wusong Fort of the customs discovered the deception and seized both "Daiichi Daisei Maru" vessels. Subsequently, two more fishing vessels, "Ryobo Maru" and "Daihua Maru," arrived to collude and attempt an escape, but their scheme was uncovered, and they were also detained by the customs officers. Details were previously reported in this newspaper on August 2. It is now learned that the customs commissioner has approved the fine of one thousand yuan for "Daihua Maru" and "Ryobo Maru," and they have been released. Both "Daiichi Daisei Maru" vessels have been confiscated and will soon be put up for auction. However, the large quantity of iced fish stored in these two vessels has been delayed for so long that it has rotted in the holds and emitted an unbearable stench. Anyone passing near the vessels was nauseated for three days. Yesterday, the crew of the ships disposed of the stinking fish into the ocean to avoid affecting public health.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Numerous Disputes Regarding the Sichuan-Hankou Railway <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Feng Lizhou and Zeng Xianzhi File Mutual Lawsuits</p>
<p>Although Zeng and Feng Have Sought Mediation</p>
<p>A Strategy for Fundamental Resolution Should Be Formulated</p>
<p>The dispute over shares in the Sichuan-Hankou Railway has repeatedly led to litigation. The railway company's former general manager, Zhang Taikai, was convicted by the Shanghai District Court for embezzling over three million yuan of public funds. Subsequently, a director of the company, Mr. Li, appointed Feng Lizhou as the resident manager in Hankou. However, Feng did not take office, and Ni Gongwei was appointed in his place. Recently, Feng suddenly filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court, accusing Zeng Xianzhi of harboring a fugitive. Zeng was arrested by the court police at a banquet in Xinghualou last week and was released on bail of one thousand yuan. As no one provided surety, Zeng was detained. The reason for the lawsuit against Zeng stems from an incident several years ago. Liu Yajue, also a director of the Sichuan Railway Company, was previously detained by the Beiping Prosecutor's Office after being sued by the shareholder maintenance association. Feng Lizhou bailed him out, but he subsequently fled without a trace. The Hebei High Court then confiscated the one thousand yuan bail paid by Feng and ordered the surrender of the bailed party. Now, Feng learned that Liu Yajue was being harbored by Zeng Xianzhi, so he filed a lawsuit against Zeng. Zeng, after being arrested, also filed a countersuit against Feng, stating that he and Liu Yajue were not on good terms, and Feng often met with Liu. Liu went to Chongqing and sent a letter to Feng to inform him. How could he, Zeng, have stopped Liu's actions? He was now being groundlessly accused by Feng, and he had not yet received the summons issued by the court, as Feng had colluded with others to forge his signature, causing the court to mistakenly believe that he had received the summons and intentionally failed to appear for the hearing, leading to the issuance of an arrest warrant. This conduct constitutes false accusation and defamation, and Feng should be punished. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi held a hearing on these mutual lawsuits. The lawyer for the plaintiff, Feng Lizhou, requested a postponement, stating that the case seemed amenable to mediation. The representative lawyer for the defendant, Zeng Xianzhi, replied that the Sichuan Railway litigation was extensive and complex, such as Ni Gongwei suing Feng Lizhou and the mutual lawsuit between Feng and Zeng. Since mediation was being considered, a strategy for fundamental resolution should be formulated to avoid tangential issues. However, Zeng Xianzhi has been unable to provide bail since his arrest and remains in custody. Now that mediation is underway, he requested that Zeng be allowed to post bail. Ni Gongwei was also in court and stood up to say that he was willing to provide bail for Zeng. Judge Wu then instructed Zeng Xianzhi to provide a surety who would appear whenever summoned. The guarantor must have a legitimate occupation. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Hu Die's Reply Regarding Contract Termination Case <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Sophistry Has No Value for Refutation</p>
<p>Only Awaiting Legal Judgment</p>
<p>Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai have been involved in litigation due to marital discord, which has recently turned into a war of words through mutual letters. Yesterday, lawyer Zhan Jifeng, representing Hu Die, replied to a letter from Lin Xuehuai's lawyers, Eson and Ni Jing'ao, stating that Miss Hu Die had seen in the newspapers that your client, Lin Xuehuai, had replied to Die's letter of the 14th of this month. Reading it, it is truly contemptible. Die's previous letter had already stated the facts and evidence, and sophistry is useless. Can deceit and trickery truly make people unable to distinguish right from wrong in this world? This kind of self-deceiving sophistry has no value for refutation. Now, a few points are selected to prove its fallacy: (1) Marriage between a man and woman is closely related to character and personality. For example, after a man and a woman are engaged, if it is discovered that the man is full of fraud and his behavior is despicable, the woman has a right to be cautious. How can marriage and character be considered separate matters? The letter refers to Die's reply as irrelevant and unresponsive, which shows a lack of common sense. (1) The accusation of emotional abandonment: it is clear that there have been two previous letters requesting the termination of the marriage contract. Now, the responsibility for unwarranted breach of contract is placed on Die, falsely accusing her of emotional abandonment. Is this what the letter calls justice? The claim that Die is surrounded by people is also noted. Die solemnly declares to the public that Die, being inexperienced in the world, was once deceived and surrounded. Now, she is trying to extricate herself from this situation to avoid future regrets. (1) The accusation that the evidence is fabricated: the matter that Die is pursuing is based entirely on evidence. Now that he knows he has no defense, he falsely accuses Die of fabricating the evidence. If this is true, why not file a criminal lawsuit? Is the crime of forging documents in Chapter 14 of the criminal law ineffective? In short, such false and deceptive words are too numerous to refute. Hereafter, we can only await legal judgment and have no time for further discussion. She entrusts this lawyer to reply and asks you to forward it. Sincerely, addressed to the two lawyers Eson and Ni Zheng'ao.</p>

<p>The Robbery Cases Were Heard First Yesterday</p>
<p>Detectives Wang Runhe and Yang Zhaoqing, along with patrolman Zhang Faxiang, of the Hongkou Police Station, successively arrested fifteen bandits, including Shen A Si, Wu Shenxian, Ling Yongnian, Miao Caibao, Chen Azhang, Li Ruishan, Li Boying, Wang Songlin, Zhou Shisheng, Li A Ming, Cai Hongsheng (also known as Ma Pi Hongsheng), the woman Fei San Ai, Wu Shenshi, Ling Taoshi, Miao Wangshi, etc., and confiscated two handguns and fourteen bullets from the home of Ling Yongnian at 880 Shanhai Pass Road. They were sent to the Special District Court for questioning and investigation. It has now been determined that the defendants committed one kidnapping and seven robberies in the concession area, listed below: (1) On February 3 of this year, the home of Zhu Wenshan at 692 Tangjia Lane was robbed of property worth 2,299 yuan. (2) On February 27 of this year, the Gu Jinji store at 531 Qipu Road was robbed of 161 yuan. (3) On December 21 of last year, the home of Zhou Zhao Shi at 71 Xin Zha Road was robbed of 705 yuan.

Patrolman Zhang Yi of the Old Gate Police Station also apprehended another kidnapper, Lu A Gen, in room 301 of the Huizhong Inn on Hankou Road, who was found to be involved in the kidnapping of Chen Shifan. Yesterday afternoon, the police station, along with the victims, escorted the defendants to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer presented the case, stating that Chen Shifan, the kidnapped victim, had not arrived, so the robbery cases should be heard first.

<h3 id="e172">Water Patrol Team Discovers Kidnapping Bandits While Patrolling the River <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Cai Huiqing, a villager from Nanjiazi Township in Yancheng, Jiangbei, had some farmland and savings, attracting the attention of bandits. In December of last year, Cai was delighted by the birth of his son and threw a grand banquet, attracting numerous guests. This attracted the attention of thieves. On the evening of December 22, Cai suddenly heard a series of loud cracking sounds outside the door. Immediately after, the wooden door was broken open by eight or nine violent thugs, who rushed in. Cai was shocked and bewildered by the situation. The robbers ordered him to remain silent, demanding money and valuables. They rushed into the inner room, forcibly taking Cai's newborn son from the bed, and fled. Cai was heartbroken but could do nothing but watch as the robbers disappeared into the distance. Afterwards, Cai enlisted his friend Sun Xiaowuzi to negotiate with the bandits, resulting in a ransom of 510 yuan to redeem his son. At around 10 PM the other night, Ren Yinglin, a member of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, 1st Division, Lujiazui and Yangjing Police Stations, was patrolling the river and noticed a rowboat moored at the docks where a person was arguing with the boatman. He immediately went to investigate, and the boatman claimed that he did not know this person and that the man had suddenly come to extort 1,350 yuan from him, leading to the conflict. Officer Ren suspected that there was more to the story than met the eye, so he detained both men and brought them and the rowboat to the Lujiazui Police Station. Officer Liu questioned them, and after reviewing the confusing statements of both parties, he suspected foul play. He ordered them to be sent to the South City General Team, where Chief Xu questioned them further. The boatman confessed his name as Xu Qixian, 24 years old, originally from Yancheng, Jiangbei. On the evening of December 22 of last year, he and his friend Li Youshun (the person arrested) and Sun Haoke, Hong Bin, and Pan San, along with others, went to Nanjiazi, Yancheng to kidnap Cai Huiqing's son. Because they had no weapons, they had to buy a string of firecrackers to set off outside Cai's house as a fake show of force before rushing in. Afterwards, Cai paid 510 yuan to redeem his son. At the time, Li Youshun received 150 yuan, Sun and Hong Ke received 80 yuan, Hong Bin and Pan San each received 20 yuan, and he, Xu, only received 30 yuan. Because the situation became dangerous, he fled to Shanghai. Since then, he considered this kind of business to be an unwise strategy, so he tried to purchase a rowboat in order to make a living by transporting people safely. However, Li Youshun was greedy and demanding. Tonight, he came to extort money from him again, leading to his arrest. Interrogated, Li Youshun confessed that he was 32 years old and from Yancheng. In December of last year, he, Xu Qixian, and his friends went to Nanjiazi to kidnap Cai Huiqing's son. Later, after Xu received the ransom, he fled to Shanghai and enjoyed it all by himself. Only today did he discover Xu and joined his friends Xu Da Jinbao Zi, Xu Xiao Ya Zi, and Li Sanbao to go to Xu's boat to demand that the ransom money be divided equally. Xu was stingy and refused to give them any money, leading to a dispute that was overheard by the police. When the police arrived, Xu Da and the others took the opportunity to escape first. He, Li, was too slow to react and was arrested. Because the case involved kidnapping, an official report was prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Xu Guoying, a Key Suspect in a Kidnapping Case, Is He a Military Officer? <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Because He Has Already Been Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>He Claims He Should Be Subjected to Military Trial</p>
<p>Xu Guoying, a native of Ninghai, was arrested by the Public Concession Police for committing a major kidnapping case and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the former Provisional Court. Xu refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appeal, declaring that Xu was the captain of the Detective Team of the 5th Brigade of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force and a special agent of the Provincial Government. Since he was a military officer, he should be tried by a military court, and the ordinary court had no jurisdiction. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Song and Judge Du of the High Branch Court held a hearing. Chief Judge Song ordered the police lawyer to present the organizational chart of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force for review. Xu then confessed to his previous position, stating that he was a captain. The police lawyer then stated that when Xu was arrested, the Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Force and the Garrison Command had both sent documents requesting his transfer, but the trial judge at that time determined that the Security Force was a police agency with the authority to accept and make a judgment. Xu then appealed to the appellate court, which was also rejected. This shows that he should not be under the jurisdiction of a military agency. The nature of the Security Force is similar to that of the Public Security Bureau. Xu should belong to the police force. Therefore, the research that should be done in this case is whether Xu is a military officer or a police officer. If he is a military officer, does the High Court have the authority to hear the case? These two points are very important and will be expressed in writing. Please reschedule the hearing. Lawyer Jiang continued by stating that the Security Force was organized according to the army organization law and should be treated the same as military personnel. The court ordered a rescheduling to wait for the police lawyer to submit his written opinion before reviewing it.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 1:15 PM, four robbers speaking with a northern accent stormed into Laofengxiang Jewelry Store, owned by Shanghai gentry Wang Yiting, at 26 Zhaojia Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi. Two wore black clothing, one wore gray, and one wore blue; one wore a melon-shaped cap, and the other three wore copper-basin-style felt hats. Each carried a No. 3 wooden box pistol. Two of the robbers approached the counter, pretending to be buying gold jewelry and haggling over prices. At that time, two other robbers burst in and went straight to the security guard Zhao Jingzhong, who was on duty at the store. As the guard was about to stand up, the two robbers pulled out box pistols, pointed them at him, and confiscated his Browning pistol No. 181 (containing seven bullets) and whistle. At the same time, the two robbers standing at the counter jumped over it and quickly robbed the cash drawer of 2,871 yuan in banknotes and over 200 yuan in small coins. The robbers then fled westward through the main door with their loot. The guard, seeing that the robbers had gone far away, quickly ran to report to the 2nd Precinct of the 1st District. Director Ma was attending a bureau affairs meeting at the General Bureau when he heard the alarm and rushed back to the precinct. At that time, inspectors and dozens of officers had already gone to surround and search for the robbers, but they were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>People from Guan Lane Are Very Ferocious</p>
<p>Zhang Yu Shi, wife of Zhang Jinsong, a paper envelope business owner from Danyang, resided at No. 48 Baoxing Fang, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. She was 33 years old and had four children, all quite mischievous. The other day, her eldest son picked up a piece of firewood from someone in Guan Lane and brought it home. Tang Denglian, from Guan Lane, saw this and beat the child. Hearing her child's cries, Mrs. Zhang went out to reason with him, but Tang punched her twice in the head. Mrs. Zhang immediately collapsed to the ground. The police took Tang into custody at the Fourth District Police Station and sent Mrs. Zhang to Jisheng Hospital, where she died yesterday despite treatment. The police station then sent Tang to the District Court for prosecution and ordered the land guarantor of the Second Division, Wang Shaoting, to report the incident to the District Court for verification.</p>

<p>Impressions of the Preciousness of Gold and the Cunning of Merchants</p>
<p>Since Li Guangzhen took charge of the Second District Baijiu Excise Office, two and a half years have passed with good results. Because over fifty wine shops in the city often sell adulterated liquor, which is harmful to hygiene, he immediately ordered all inspectors to prohibit it. The amount of liquor transported from the wine-producing areas of Hengjing in Pudong and the Jiangbei area has also gradually increased. Furthermore, since the price of gold has risen, both genuine and adulterated liquor have become expensive, so most of the adulterated liquor in the city has largely disappeared from the market.</p>

After one month, new shares will be exchanged for the receipt. In addition, a letter will be sent to each shareholder for notification, and it is hoped that there will be no delay.</p>

<p>Zhang Ajin, 35 years old, a Ningbo native and carpenter working for Hemaoshui Woodworks at 94 Yongxiang Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, Donghanbilei Road, Hongkou, was installing an awning at the Asiatic Petroleum Company at the intersection of Edward Road yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM.

<p>Chen Youming, a Dantu native residing at No. 15 Peng Road, sought treatment from Dr. Yuan Wenduo's clinic at No. 273 Fengtian Road on the first day of last month due to illness. After diagnosis, Yuan gave him a prescription. The prescribed medicine contained eight fen of western ephedra, four fen of asarum, and eight fen of light dried ginger. Chen was suffering from insomnia and indigestion. After taking the medicine, his symptoms suddenly changed. That night, he became feverish and lost consciousness. By morning, he was coughing up blood, and his life was in danger. He immediately went back for a follow-up visit and told Yuan about his condition. Yuan then realized that the medicine he had used was too strong and changed the prescription to a cooling medicine. Chen was afraid that such a combination of cold and hot, strong and mild treatments would not be effective and would lead to danger, so he abandoned the prescription and did not buy the medicine. Instead, he sought treatment from Dr. Zhou Jianbang. Dr. Zhou, after learning about the previously taken medicine, found that all the medicines were not appropriate for the symptoms, so he re-prescribed. Later, Chen asked Dr. Cai Yousheng and other doctors to evaluate Yuan's prescription. They all believed that the prescription was wrong. Fortunately, he changed doctors early, and his life was not sacrificed. Now that Chen's illness has been cured, he believes that the negligence of a doctor can be terrifying. If he is not punished by law, he will not learn a lesson. He hired lawyer Wang Shizong to file a criminal self-accusation with the Special District Local Court for negligent injury, requesting punishment according to Article 301, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, in order to warn those negligent doctors who treat human life as a child's play. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the court to hear the case. The defendant, Yuan Wenduo, failed to appear, so the trial could not proceed. The judge ordered that the defendant be summoned again to appear in court for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
