<p>時評</p>
<h3>狂風大雪</h3>
<p>去冬至今。世界之嚴寒地震。時有所聞。天時變幻。視歷年爲多。於今又入春季。氣象變化之時。故天災之流行。又復相告。據巴塞爾電。瑞士法奥意。四國間之阿爾匹山脈。遇向來未有之大雪。交通全阻數百村鎭。困居山間。四國官吏。各盡力以謀恢復交通。又據巴黎電稱。地中海現仍有狂猛之風暴。法國有一魚雷艇。及一搭載旅客之水飛機。陷在風浪之中。雖派造驅逐艦四艘及一拖船施救。皆因浪勢過猛而不能接近云云。於此二事。可見天時之異常。不僅人心之變幻。爲近時之特徵也。</p>
<p>從來天人相感之說。每以天災之流行。歸咎於人事之不當。而特以天災以示戒。其實以我言之。天時人事原屬一貫。地體運行而入於一不和平之氣界。則氣候因之而生暴烈人心亦因之而多不平古人所謂涙氣所鍾。非僅屬於一人。一地而普於世界全球也。惟人類苟能平心靜氣。以意識制勝感觸之氣。而不爲所動。則世事自平。斯卽古人所謂人定勝天也。</p>

<h3>英美日三國海軍公約</h3>
<p>▲有成爲五國公約趨勢</p>
<p>英法雙方先有成議</p>
<p>意大利態度堪注意</p>
<p>英代表怱遽赴羅馬</p>
<p>張起法人揣測</p>
<p>德將要求同樣原則</p>
<p>輿論深感不安</p>
<p>▲路透社二十四日巴黎電　去年英美日三國所簽之倫敦海軍公約、今有變爲五國公約之趨勢、其成功與否、繫諸意國、英法今日已大致議定法國可加入此公約之條件、如意國亦加入、則此約卽可簽字、如意國拒絶、則英法成議當然不能成立、因法國所提出如意國增加其海軍建築、則法國可自由行動之保障條件、英國迄今尚未承認之也、上述消息、係今日午後得自英人方面、今午法外長白里安曾設宴招待英國外相與海相、今夜英外相等起程赴羅馬、與意政府討論此全部問題、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十四日柏林電　英法海軍談判、一日之間形勢數變、午間法政府深信在午夜以前、雙方必能簽正草約、乃會議至暮卽行中輟、英外相漢得森海相亞歷山大偕專家等深夜起程、怱遽赴羅馬、據其宣稱、談判已達一階段、有與意政府商榷之必要、但法政界對於英代表之離法、有若請空霹歷、莫名眞意所在、有稱足見一切已談妥者、亦有謂其表示談判已陷入僵局者、而各晚報亦誡人民勿過樂觀、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十五日巴黎電　羣衆對縮减海軍案之討論進行、因英代表陡然前赴羅馬、大爲注意、據云、英法對此事之談判已全部同意、祇須意國亦能認可、卽有切實之解决、說者謂英國代表亦已表示意國决可不至有所違言、法方官報聲稱、日美兩國對此次談判之進行、均一一詳悉云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十四日柏林電　德報對於英法海軍皆有長評、類多感覺不安、深慮英國以對於陸地軍縮之大讓步、換取法意之海軍比額、致將來法人在國際軍縮會議内、恃英人之暗袒、得以逞所欲爲、設竟若此、則該會必致毫無結果、現德政府已重申前議、力主陸地軍縮之均等原則否則惟有退出國際聯盟、因德國亦當取得如他國之同樣安全云、</p>
<h3>法國會辯論海軍預算</h3>

<p>▲國民社二十五日巴黎電　各報今日對賴伐爾内閣關於社會黨所提議之將輔助失業費由二五·○○○·○○○佛郎、增至一○○·○○○·○○○佛郎一案之失敗、論斷紛拏、左派機關報聲言、該内閣經此案之失敗、已有根本摇動之可虞、似無庸諱言、而右派機關報則謂此事實無關輕重、蓋並無不信任之案追踪該案而提出也、</p>
<h3>英法財政談判</h3>
<p>注重對外借欵</p>
<p>具體辦法在編製中</p>
<p>▲路透社二十四日倫敦電　英財政部發表一文、言過去兩月内英法財政部員間之討論事、謂雙方皆承認亟宜注重債權國、以尋常範圍向外借出債欵之恢復、並承認目前借欵困難、大都由於投資者對於債戸之缺少信任、故借入國必須自己竭力恢復此信任、國聯前有决議欲開始詳細的討論、俾農業借欵易在中歐與東歐招募、至具體辦法、刻正由專家編製之、英法財政部員之談話、非欲在一定事件上成立切實的國際協定、但欲在與英法財政經濟大有關係之事件上成立一種接洽、此種接洽應予維持、隨時互換意見、當英法討論時、彼此直率而親善、曾考慮倫敦與巴黎間現金非常流動之原因、法當道亦不歡迎此種流動、且極欲就可能範圍避免可助成此種流動之舉動、法財政部不承認其管理法國公欵之方法、有促成現金湧入法國之勢力但願按其自己需要、考察其方法實施所可及於金融市况之反響、雙方皆以爲英法財政部應與由國聯金委員會報告書而發生之種種問題相接觸、法當道屢次表示其意、願提倡巴黎市塲之對外借出、此後舉動所以促進在效力之合作、以便利借欵者、當可稍減目前市况之蕭索、故所有關於此層之可能性、將一一加以研究云、</p>

<h3>謀害古巴總統詳情</h3>
<p>▲路透社二十四日古巴京城電　昨日謀害古巴總統事之詳情、現已發表、有一衞兵以定時自炸之炸彈、沿通氣管而下、墜於總統浴室、定淸晨四時半爆烈、因總統將於是時晨浴也、但此自炸彈並未下墜至目的地、而在總統浴室上層之室中爆裂、故總統未受傷、然已險矣、現戒備異常嚴密、以保衞總統之安全、總統府四周衞隊密佈、</p>

<p>▲路透社二十四日倫敦電　日昨傳說摩斯萊等將於今日工黨會議時宣佈脫離工黨、並將另組國家社會黨、但現悉此派將仍在下院另成一派、惟脫離工黨與否一層、則聽各人自由行動、此項决定能否與工黨執行委員會之見解相合、尚難逆料、有數方面以爲摩斯萊派活動中之新發展、將被視爲涉及黨紀之舉動、如摩等不自動脫黨、工黨或將要求其出黨、摩派現已有二人函致黨魁麥唐納、聲明脫離國會工黨、但是否欲辭去下院議員職、則尚無所聞、今日摩斯萊發表其新宣言、其大旨與數月前所發表之宣言相似、卽組織五人緊急内閣、以舉辦國家計劃、並創立發展新實業刷新舊有實業之機關等是也、</p>

<h3>張輝瓚之死　王公羽</h3>
<p>第十八師師長張輝瓚之捐軀消息。突如其來。聞者莫不鏌愕。蓋張部與共軍激戰於東固龍崗時。旣未有詳細記載。而力竭被俘之耗。亦復缺如。乃突然記其被害。某哨兵於河畔發現其首級得勿令人有茫陒摸不着頭腦之感邪。爰述所聞於下。張氏此番奉命剿共異常認眞。每單必身先士卒。龍崗之役。鏖戰數晝夜。已擊破共匪主力。顧共匪人衆。消息靈通。四方援軍大至。而張部則感孤立。彈亦垂罄。寖成衆寡縣殊陷入重圍。張兵遂不幸被俘。同時部下之被俘者亦不少。共匪初獲張氏。待遇頗優。冀其降附張氏服膺黨義。久而彌堅。詎肯失身。故共匪迭次勸說。皆嚴詞拒之。且厲聲斥駡。大有張睢陽駡賊之概。共匪怒。遂於上月二十八日開大會議决。以最殘忍之方法。置張氏於死。復割下張氏首級。用鐵釘釘其兩耳於一匾額之上。額曰「張氏宗祠。」覆以紅布。附標語數則。浮諸河面。任其所之。蓋殘忍而又惡作劇。全無人道思想也。本月二日。駐吉之七十七師哨兵。首於河畔見之。經其部下及親戚辨認無訛後。始由十八師參謀長率全體人員迎入師部。贛主席魯滌平氏。方養疴於南昌醫院。聞訊大哭。親至師部祭奠。以張氏遺骸祗有首級。特僱匠雕一木體。合成全骸。衣陸軍上將黄昵軍服。棺則爲楠木製。</p>
<p>價值千二百元。魯氏又爲之請於國府。從優議卹。國府准予公葬。二十二日長沙電。何鍵又撥六千元作張氏葬費。是則身後</p>
<h3>大風到車記　·嵇·覲</h3>
<p>德意志西部。每當季候風交替之時。山鳴谷嘯。必有一番劇烈之變象。頃據柏林通訊云。本月上旬。布尼堡與克里茲間之輕便鐵道。載有客車一列。共十六輛。行至半途。砉然一聲。盡被吹倒。乘客中有受傷者。有壓死者。事後調查。約計二三百人。當風起時。天文台迭發警告。海外輪舶。一律抛錨。以爲火車是載重之物。陸地行走。可保無事。不料經過迦特山間。兩峰對立。風力過猛。實有排山倒海之勢。司機者開足馬力。冒險前進。致肇此禍。同時兩旁樹木以及大小屋舍爲之倒塌者。不計其數說者謂此風速率。每小時可行五十英里。實爲數十年來得未曾有云。</p>
<p>哀榮。尚足以報張氏殉難之志。可無憾也。按張氏生平。極忠於故院長譚茶陵。趙恒惕爲湖南省長時。因罷一鎭守使。引起戰爭。譚故院長奉中山先生命爲湖南省長。兼湘軍總司令。率軍援湘。是時張氏與唐生智等。均爲湘軍將領。表面受趙指揮。隂實同情於譚。卒以此成和局。其後譚又奉命回軍援粤。雖爲趙所敗而趙志終不能大申。卽諸將掣肘之故也。惜其時諸將領中。不盡如張氏。遂使趙恒惕得安於其位耳。</p>
<h3>張璧月自殺紀聞　志政</h3>
<p>最近大同女生張璧月自殺。頗引起社會人士之注意。一昨晤大同大學某君。談及張女士生前及死後狀况甚詳。爰擇要記之。</p>
<p>▲名聞全校　張璧月者。蓋卽前在徐州槍擊其姊夫黄長典者也。當時張至法院自首。官念其年幼。未加處罰。惟其事早已喧騰報章。舉國皆知矣。張入大同爲避免同學注目起見。特改名張鏡如。　不久由好事者傳出。於是全校皆知其人。每相遇。必相告語曰。此徐州女傑張璧月也。</p>
<p>▲沉靜寡言　璧月尚在初中三年級肄業。年祇十六七。平日態度沉默。凛然不可犯。衣服亦儉樸之至。蓋日常所着。不過藍布長衫而已。</p>
<p>▲初次自殺後之防範　今年張到校後。曾自殺一次。服安眠藥水數瓶。報發覺尚早。獲救。然自後學監對伊防範加嚴。凡足以使伊自殺之物。悉數移去。甚至褲帶亦不准用。並專用一女僕以伺之。孰知一未曾經意之小洋刀。竟陷伊於不救耶。</p>
<p>▲相騐時之慘狀　張自殺時。共計五刀。第一刀割斷喉管。第二刀穿太陽突。餘在上額。其性情之烈。可見一斑。相騐時。滿面盡是血汚。由工役先去。已不堪卒覩。卽由校中備棺收殮。由其姊璧池領柩歸葬。</p>
<p>▲嚇煞三位蜜絲　與張女士同室者。尚有三位蜜絲。事出後三人恐慌達於極點。</p>
<p>蓋張之自殺。卽在室内。而又備極傷慘。腦筋中印象旣深。宵來偶憶。無不毛戴也</p>
<p>▲眞相不明　張女士何爲而自殺。其原因至今不明。蓋旣無遺書發現。且死前將各種函件。悉數焚燬。故眞正原因。尚在揣測中云。</p>
<h3>平郊古墓齊遭刦　石顔也</h3>
<p>盜墓之風。肇於關東之陵寢。不謂年來盛於北平四郊。古墓之遭匪徒慘刦者。時有所聞。惟地下人僅有聲於當時。無聞於後世。故其墓之毁。注意者少。最近楊繼盛劉瑾諸墓。又以被盜聞。於是聞者駭然。奔走相告矣。</p>
<p>平郊長辛店。有山溝一道。蜿蜒數里。其間林木森森。風物秀美。有巨塜七十二。俗謂七十御帶墳。明之楊繼盛太監劉瑾。亦枕首邱於此。其他亦悉爲明淸顯者之墓。珍物之殉葬者必多。矧其間鬱鬱佳城。又達七十二數之衆。宜遭匪徒之覬觎矣。獻歲以來。各墓莫不慘遭發掘。桐棺砍毁。白骨狼藉。殉葬珍寳。盡携以去。過其地者。莫不嘆塜中人之慘罹浩刦也。而一片荒凉中。尚僅楊劉兩塜。爲人所識。餘多不知塜中究爲何人。此其故。以各顯者後裔式微。或遠處他鄉。一則已無人顧問。一則亦路遙而莫聞也。匪徒約百人。亦有地方惡徒雜其間。悉武裝。横行平郊。其他各王公太子等墓被盜者。爲數尤多。損失當在百萬以上。聞在某太子墓中。得玉物至夥。全數以十萬金爲一英人易去云。</p>
<p>武淸縣中。尚有一淸進士王某墓。王生時顯赫。歷任晋省要職。死之日。建瑩達百餘畝地。一巨塜也。邇亦爲盜所盜。惟當毁塜碎棺時。遍覓無所獲。蓋進士雖膺</p>
<p>重寄。而廉潔自守。一介不取。生旣兩袖淸風。死後自祇有山間明月長與爲伴耳。衆匪於悲憤之餘、碎棺如粉。火骨使灰。慘酷至不可名狀。生前淸廉。死後轉以此而遭刦。當非進士之所及料也。</p>
<p>此外若今人之墓。平民之塜。苟有一長物殉葬者。盜輩亦必百計探訪。破其穴而携之去。　縣有龔姓。母葬方十日。卽毁於匪手。殉物値數百金。旣携去。而屍亦有粉骨碎身之慘。吁。盜之肉其足食乎</p>
<h3>革命靑年張軍光　痴珠</h3>
<p>革命黨人。多風流瀟灑。倜儻不覊之士。南匯張軍光氏。其流亞也。氏年少英俊。有孟嘗君風。早歲。慨國勢之不振。深知革命之需要。卽以身許國。殆卒業軍校後。卽在滬從事實際工作。備經艱險。絶不畏懼。事敗被逮。繫獄數月。怡如也。旣經友人營救脫險。氣乃益壯。民十六春。任上海總指揮職。指揮數千便衣健兒。秘密工作。頗具成績。黨軍收復上海之役。張氏與有力焉江南旣定。復率健兒轉戰江北。南北統一。始解組來滬。從事著述。緣氏於文學有特嗜。與學者田梓琴何世枚輩遊。研討學術。頗有心得。近傳氏向政治舞臺活動不確。蓋氏方著述一種哲學書。洋洋數萬言。不久卽可問世。初無意於政治生活也。</p>
<p>氏豪俠好義。因從事秘密工作。尤多交結江湖。大江南北黨會中人。無不知有張軍光其人者。蓋氏爲前輩張樹聲所激賞。張氏名震南北。已數十年。江湖上稱天王老子。氏亦因是爲江湖所重。孫傳芳負嵎江北之際。萑苻四起。黨軍初抵江北。一時不易撲滅。周鳳歧二十六軍之一部。曾被繳械。其猖獗可知。時張亦率隊過此。頗有戒心。中途。聞有槍聲。疑敵至。指揮布防。孰知來者非敵。乃當地綠林前來歡迎者。氏恐有詐。喝令棄械舉代表問話。則云久仰英名。特來迎送。並願爲之先驅。一時軍中傳爲美談。是則得力於天王老子者也。</p>
<p>更正　前日所刊硤石古蹟被毁記一稿。所有「硤」</p>
<p>字皆誤排「砆」字。又南洋遊記號碼爲「一二四」誤爲「二一四」。并此更正。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三七四）　包天笑</h3>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>原來那位葉桐侯是個浙江嘉興人。現爲上海和平洋行買辦。那個洋行的名字。喚做和平。他們的業務。却大不和平。是一家軍裝的行家。葉桐侯便做了那行裏的軍裝買辦。其實他也是一位書香子弟。他的父親。是當代的一位名教育家。父親督責他讀書。他老是逃學。父親責備他。他說現在的求學問。到處都是學問。何必孳孳矻矻到書本子裏去鑽尋。變成一條大書蟲。恰巧他那位父親。是一位手不釋卷的老先生。把父親兼得說不出話來。也只好一任他自由。進學校也好。不進學校也好。那時在前淸時代。科舉還没有廢。忽然之間。他進了一個學。考取了一名秀才。連他父親知道也不知道。還是經人家給葉老先生賀喜。葉先生愕然。說是喜從何來。賀喜的道。世兄進了學了。葉老先生不信。說那裏還能進學。一天到晚在外面荒唐。後來一問。果然是進了學。拿文字一看。不但是通順。而且很有幾句警策語。葉老先生嘴裏說。荒唐。胡閙。眞是僥倖。其詞若有憾焉。其實也有些高興。但是葉桐侯始終不能受父親的束縛。他到了上海來。忽而進學校。忽而又出來了。每一個學校。往住不到三個月。便覺得受不了這個拘束。卽行出來。又換一種學校。過了幾個月。學校生活覺得厭了。又得換一種新空氣。忽然從事於文學生活。使便做了一部小說。自稱爲浪蕩男兒。描寫上海的一班自命爲新學界的革命人物。倒也被他描寫得淋漓盡致。總之這位葉桐侯。是一個絶頂聰明的人。他做一樣就能成功一樣。可惜他是博而不專。在民國元二年的時候。他在上海。很認得幾位軍政界的人物。那時中國人購買軍火的一件事。非得請教外國洋行家不可。做軍裝的洋行家。就希望中國有内亂。中國一有内亂。他們的生意就來了。這個時候。歐戰　不曾發生。各國的殺人器械。有許多科學家在發明。眞可以算得日新月異。今年發明的那一種殺人利器。明年的就用不着了。到了明年。今年的又覺得陳舊了。積之旣久。那些陳舊的軍械。消納到什麽地方去呢。要是消到各國去吧。歐洲各國。他們自己也有他自己的新發明。他們怎要你的舊東西。一聽到中國有内亂。所有十九世紀他們廢棄不用的軍械。都送到了中國市塲來了。</p>

<h3>糧食　米市一蹶不振</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各帮到源祇十餘號　市銷因各店底貨仍厚、進胃寥寥無幾行情遂又見跌、北帮白粳竟一蹶而不振、又小兩角之譖、特别開十三元半左右、情况殊無起色之望、薄稻貨稀到接、銷塲平庸　又軟角左羊秈杜秈市胃欠爽、貨客　欲觀望　然大勢所趨、因乃步短角外、變元隂化節　下游、市價仍疲一角許、</p>
<p>▲滬南　昨日内地到船二十號之譜、去路平淡、常帮白粳微有見抵、然銷呆平庸、因而甚疲、</p>
<p>蘇同各　零銷不爽、進胃呆木、又小角半、南帮薄早稻來源見殷、客胃極懈、續見軟化、羊杜尖由定轉跌、去路奇滯變元不佳、貨　利在速售、行情因乃又短一兩角</p>
<h3>粉市午後隨金價回漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後各月份仍見疲滯之象、</p>
<p>以洋麥報價又見微小、業外人心未免觀望幾家大廠、因手中所定之洋麥尚多、依然乘勢抛出、故遠則最低時雖較前日又小一分左右、近期因現粉售價、如兵船開二兩二錢七分半扣、雙馬則開至二兩二錢八分七厘半扣、致人心甚穩、迨至下午開盤初尚平定、旋以金價回漲、外行人心爲之帶振較上午之最低盤回起一　餘觀後步稍長、仍看外匯之長縮也結果本月份較前日漲七厘半、三月份漲一分二厘半、四月份漲五厘、五月份漲二厘半六七月份未動云、</p>
<h3>期麥疲而復堅</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面初　繼堅之象上午各盤以洋麥報小授受均寂惟較前日收價　小去二三分不等迨至下午盤以金價又復提高、外匯掛縮業外之買月又見活動較上午收價計好三四分不等觀往後之　勢雖外　　縮當然此後近遠之間當仍以事實爲依歸也結果本月份較前日大　分　四月份大二分、五月份大三分、六七月大二分　現貨因授受均寂無開云、</p>
<h3>標準黄荳轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日黄豆市初開平庸、嗣因大連來電告挺、兼之標金向上、人心見佳、浮空抵　、少無客帶略進、故下午各月份均好三四分不等、刻下現銷尚活、雖有　　影響、然實際則操之日商手中、緣連市之變化、最爲注重也、結果二月五月均大四分、三月大三分、四月大二分、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白回漲一錢</h3>
<p>▲日車精初開一萬包</p>

<h3>海味　干貝貨稀居奇</h3>
<p>千貝查去年各地産額不盥、比往歲收穫不及十之五六　致來源不多街貨少存、一過客銷發動　市呈供不　求、迨至近日各　存貨更感缺乏故無論行號若有存貨者莫不居奇故市盤造成空前之高價昨行盤兜售中粒湘館貨二百四十兩大粒二百二十八兩三角貝新光短刀一百八十二兩老色一百七十五兩碎粒二百十五兩次至一百八十兩靑森一百六十兩至一百五十五兩　烟台貨一百五十二兩　至一百四十兩客帮生意雖少動辦然脚地堅挺市頗堅穩</p>
<h3>南北貨　湘蓮地價轉緊</h3>
<p>湘蓮昨據漢口函訊、趨勢頗具緊象、查地頭存底統共不上千件、其中普通貨居十之六、高貨尤缺、衡州運喊價二十七兩、（每担計）、冲九溪　二十五兩、常蓮前市爲二十三兩四錢、現市大約二十四兩日内可期成盤惟申市以銷　殊覺平常也、▲黑瓜子前昨兩日均有開出、計碭山子·障樹子均十二兩、徐魁子十一兩半、中牟子九兩四錢半、▲亳州紅棗漢市存貨較高、須七兩二錢至四錢、划申萬難合算、此間普通貨昨開七兩二錢尚覺俏利、</p>
<h3>菜榨回跌圓肉轉緊</h3>

<h3>絲茶　法莊絲銷停滯</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲銷益無生氣、緣法屬馬賽等處因受大雪嚴寒之天災、綢銷大滯、綢廠原料存底較充、生絲進胃不動、滬埠華絲實銷停頓、市氣益呆、昨祇緯成進滬白廠經現貨十包、和興進黄搖經五包、新時昌進白乾經五十包、價尚平定</p>
<h3>曰頭莊動辦貢熙茶</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英俄兩莊仍有零星進胃、針眉珠茶等項、法莊亦略有需求、市面大致無變化、惟貢熙綠茶、自俄莊宣告停辦後、交易久在停頓中、日來曰頭莊謙義富杯等行、得悉孟買市塲、茶銷發動、均紛紛乘時動辦、昨市成交六百餘箱、售價二十六七兩、較前見跌二三兩云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　各貨價略見回跌</h3>
<p>疋頭市面、因開價過高、故日來走銷頗靜、加以同業中手貨尚多致參差不一、但金市昨又上漲、人心尚能站定　本街需要仍呆　客帮中津帮去化略靜、靑島帮進意轉濃、四川帮昨略開手成交細嗶嘰直貢呢染色布等一百餘件、貨價較之前數日稍跌、直貢呢小五厘　獵雁售四錢一分、莫干山四錢零七厘半、雙意鹿三錢六分半、細嗶嘰以下身貨較軟、跌去有一分左右、三友圖爲三錢五分半、歡樂三錢六分二厘半、湖心車三錢六分七厘半、公　圖三錢五分、灰光斜小二錢　昨五兩八錢均肯脫手矣、漂布昨福壽三星十一兩七錢半、郭子儀十二兩七錢半、亦略見小、惟西貨依然上漲公平之隂丹士林竹布細布繼漲三四錢放鯉直貢呢售出三錢五分矣、</p>
<h3>直貢呢春盤堅漲</h3>
<p>元靑直貢呢春盤開出　明暗俱挺、蓋該呢中西衣服需料甚緊、申地舊存之貨早已斷檔、今春新貨到埠有限、兼關稅與先令之關係、成本增加、故同業心思甚　、現最歹之單面貨每碼躉批須售三兩六七錢、上身貨售至八兩左右、前售三兩零之普通貨、今一律漲至五兩上下矣、</p>

<h3>上海著名鑽石店失竊大宗珍品</h3>
<p>▲樑上君子果從樑上來</p>
<p>▲破穹窿屋頂繫繩而下</p>
<p>▲名貴手表鑽飾均被竊</p>
<p>▲店主之手槍一併携去</p>
<p>鑽石商新利洋行、爲滬上有數之鑽石商店、每年營業、以千百萬金計、主顧多富紳貴婦、達商顯宦、若普通人士、但於行經其店門時、向窗櫉中流盼顧視、略一駐足而已、昨早晨光曦微中、此鑽石商店内、忽然燈燭耀煌、人影幢幢、數分鐘内、警備車載武裝警士大隊、絶馳而來、而明察秋毫燃犀洞燭之偵探多人、穿戸登樸、蹲地捫壁、尤形忙碌、讀者始閉目一思、此種情形、腦海中之第一印象、當屬「珠寳失竊」無疑也、出事之時間、爲昨晨四時半左右、被竊者爲名貴之腕時計及小件鑽飾等、約値兩萬金、至竊賊何由而登堂入室、進此寳庫者、其運計旣屬老到、手腕尤稱靈敏、在上海賊史中、堪得一頁新紀錄之地位焉、</p>
<p>樑土君子、來必夤夜、若在晨雞將唱、東方猶黑之時、則寸隂可惜、尤屬寳貴、蓋因五更好夢、往往直到天明、妙手兒正可趁此時機、大顯身手、而不爲物主所警覺也、新利洋行之賊貴客、所以在四時半左名動手者、實有一番至意在焉、當時第一發覺失竊者、爲看夜之巡丁、見店當内忽現不速之客、於是鳴警請究、中央捕房得到警訊後、立卽派探馳往、大事搜捕、然而賊去無蹤、所留者祗一二賊痕而已、初探捕等馳抵南京路新利洋行大門時、見鐵棚森森、無緣得入、於是急用電話、通知店主鮑愛士、鮑君從被中躍起、直奔新利門口、解囊出匙、拔關納客、諸探警始得從容進内、各以門外之意想與室内之實狀、互相參證、</p>
<p>室内作何形狀、此時賓主雙方心中均繫此想、然進屋後、撚鈕明燈、見各物井然、珠光寳氣、輕繞燈影、溶作薄霧、寳山如昨、固與平日無異、所不同者則内進一櫃與原狀週别、蓋而已破、呈顯各物已生翼飛去、主人檢點之下、手表百餘隻、珠飾若干件、成已化作烏有、更視大門後戸、均完好無　、但仰望承塵、破綻立見、賊果從天而降者也、屋頂天花板下、本用巨塊玻璃、　嵌作穹　狀、賊從屋頂穿穴移去玻璃一角、然後繫繩於身、縋索而下、因得直抵中心、破櫃取貨、旣醉且飽、仍從原路而去、以後之賊的行動、則無從揣測矣、惟尚有一事可奇者、店主鮑愛士有手槍一枝、藏於寫字檯抽屜中者、亦如千金于歸、小婢作陪、隨之同去、咸從空中走脫也、</p>
<p>新利洋行在南京路一百零五號沙利文之東、而烏利文之對面也、有謀得利琴行、西比利亞首飾公司、及麥瑞糖果店、等爲之拱衞、所售鑽石珠寳珍奇貴品在滬首屈一指、昨晨被竊各物、估値至少一萬八千金、與年前烏利文之珠寳失竊案、雖價値大小縣殊、而情節佈局、堪相伯仲、卽稱爲後來居上、亦無不可、側聞中央捕房於出事後若干小時、卽拘獲兩人、然訊無嫌疑、未幾卽釋、據巡丁稱、竊賊似穿西裝、或者係流離海上之異國名手所爲、亦未可知、至新利賣買、昨仍照常、故過其戸外者、仍見玻窗之中、玲瓏珍物、晶光燦爛、直射路人之目、</p>

<p>▲金貴銀賤客兌金戒　昨午飯刻零點左右、老鴻翔銀樓各夥友、正欲進餐果腹時、突有賣客三人、魚貫進店、兩年輕、一年老均操異地口音立在櫃外、聲稱要兌金指子、此時兩年輕者立在一起、而老者則且言且向内進、經理王鼎成、以爲際此金貴銀賤之時、何物好買客、來兌金指環、當端詳來人、衣衫雖周、舉止可疑、正擬發問時、老盜直奔王之胸前、將槍抵住其胸口、說時遲、行時快、兩年輕匪口不出聲、飛腿過櫃、各夥友其時呆立食桌之旁、不知所云、正在面面相覷時、門外又來三好漢、兩個直奔上樓、一個把門望風、然登樓之兩匪、未幾以樓上並無生路、瞬息間又緣梯而下、與店堂内之兩匪、互相合作、於是一面將經理及各夥友驅諸室隅一面卽開抽屜、倒賬箱、以求所謂黄貨者、無如黄金難求、勞而無功、祇得降尊屈就、將櫃台上之大洋六十元、及小銀圓二百數十角、携之而走、乃臨别之時、忽來異響、賬房孫介俊、竟中彈倒地矣、</p>
<p>▲三人受傷一匪就擒　賬房孫介俊、本在樓上、見登樓之兩匪下梯後、亦卽移步下來、執警笛於手中擬吹、匪見孫將敗事、卽發槍一擊、正中警笛之尾圜、然孫之左手無名指、亦隨圜而落、負傷倒地、然槍彈之勢、猶未止此、擊中孫手後、更將面盆打破、直至遇到盆面内之濕手巾始止住其澎漲之力、孫旣流血、匪亦携贓拔步四散逸去、然當各夥友被匪監禁於室隅時、將預裝通知鄰店大春南貨號之警鈴一撳、大春得訊、正欲吹警笛發難、而把風之匪、則以槍口遙禁、戒令勿得聲張、幸人多匪少、卒被用電話通知新閘捕房、立刻有探捕到塲、逃匪中有一股逸入老鴻翔東首之聚慶里三百零九號半門牌内、被探當塲提住、惟雙方格鬬時、曾發十餘槍、當有行人婦女沈翠娥及一幼孩受流彈擊傷、一中足部、一中背部、尚無大碍耳、</p>
<p>▲兩度受刦幸無鉅創　記者得訊後、曾往老鴻翔訪問實情、所云略如上述、經理王君稱、渠店已兩度被刦、上次在前年、二次卽昨日也、據云滬上白晝盜刦銀樓、已數見不鮮、故渠亦極戒備之能事、匪等進店時、適係飯時、倘在平日、此時早已動　、今午因有嘉客、略備旨酒、無如酒未來而盜先降、於是客所吃者祇驚耳、盜匪搶得銀洋時、因急於藏納、欲置衣袋中、尚覺不快、乃用袖子作捷徑、舉臂尚上、鈔洋從袖口一溜而進、然盜實失策、袖口直通襟底、此路一直達地上、故銀洋鏘然有聲、地上亦留得不少也、記者聞言、相與拊掌、然案頭水仙無恙、盆中臘梅含笑、驚餘見此、亦可解嘲、因祝主人之佳運、主人筦爾一笑、送客出門、</p>

<h3>王濟遠在巴黎舉行個展獲佳譽</h3>
<p>（巴黎通訊）名畫家王濟遠於去春赴歐、今年一月一在法都巴黎舉行個人繪畫展覽會、宣揚東方藝術、頗能引起國際上之重視、並獲巴黎各報之佳評、節譯如下、</p>
<p>（一）巴黎之（Ｃomcedie）報「美術世界」（Ｗanneau）氏評、王濟遠是東方的一個名畫家、來巴黎展覽他的中國畫、我要鄭重申明、他的中國畫、不要拿來和日本畫、混爲一談、</p>
<p>中國畫之特性和風格、確乎含有永久性神秘性的保留、這些特性和風格、爲法蘭西一般人所不知、尤其是現代的中國畫、</p>
<p>王濟　　度在道兩點上、　給了我們以說明、他之所以來巴黎、不僅是專爲在（Ｒue　do　Scine）的白柳華畫　陳列他的作品、還有更重要的使命丨丨想把東方　與西方的畫的長處、融會　通去創造一種新的藝術、</p>
<p>我們最應注意的、王濟遠是一個有特殊天才的發家、在白柳華畫廊裏陳列的油畫和水彩畫、可以爲我們說明這天才是怎應樣發見、</p>
<p>試看他的作品中、有幾張是帶有傳統的精神、大部份如「花卉」「風景」全是用一種富麗而又堅實的色調、表出一種　如其分的美妙境域、處處可以露出他的天才活躍、　遠　人的特性、都表出來了、如風景中的丨西湖丨天光水色、波影横空、於抑鬱中而見雄壯、花卉中的丨春花一束丨於富麗中面沉默、還有他的素描、以隨意而引人人勝的筆绖緻寫出、也把這位畫家的極其中國的特性表示出來了、</p>
<p>（二）巴黎週報（Ｃharles　Fegdal）費格泰氏評、中國畫家王濟遠的展覽會、是很奇特很有興味的一個展覽會陳列的油畫、是有意義研究並吸取歐洲技術的佳作、我們發見他應用了印象主義者的光色、外光主義者的學理、和搆造主義者的嚴謹丨這是顯然的丨但是一到王濟遠隨着他的遠東人的性格、他的亞洲的方式來觀察來感覺、他的靈感和他的個人的風格時、他的特有的風韵、和他的眞正的動人處、立卽呈現於吾人之目前、試看他的風景畫、尤其是水彩畫我們隨爲一種奇異而遥遠的詩意、一種想像的和夢幻的所在的鄉思、一種行旅的永恒的　望所攫住、我們這個極　的中國藝術家王濟遠的畫幅、給吾人以良好的印象、並足神游物外、</p>
<p>巴黎之英文日　報丨藝術世界一節丨、中國藝術家王濟遠之個展、確能於此藝術沉默期中提起吾人以巨大之興趣、王氏之智能、誠如吾人所　企慕遠東藝術之高超、　因具有古代文化之浸染、使之然也、所畫之中國風景花卉等、皆　至善、而其水彩畫、尤見神妙、（二十年一月於巴黎）</p>

<p>靑年園地</p>
<h3>轉變　陸燕</h3>
<p>大學畢業、是欣喜、還是愁悶、施翼君可以告訴我們、</p>
<p>施翼是我們學校裏的高材生、他是我們之中傑出的人物、所以他特别自信、他相信他的前途是光明而遠大、他相信以他的才能將來到社會上一定會被重用、他的自信、是他努力讀書的一個動力、因他成績的優越、更加鞏固了他的自信、所以學校裏的師長和同學都很敬愛他、</p>
<p>他、不光是學業成績的足以使人敬愛、就是辦事的才幹、活動的能力、都足使人景仰、他是一個梗直誠勇的少年、眞理在他的面前時、他從不退讓、他仗着毅力爲眞理爭辯、學校裏有不合理的地方、他竭力呼喊、使全體同學起來反抗、所以有許多不堪其職的教授或職員、對他都有三分畏懼、校長有時也要籠絡他的、於是他很自傲、常常說、「自反而縮、雖千萬人吾往也、反自而不縮、雖褐寬博我不敢瞻也、」在他引古人的話來做他自已的口號裏、可以知道確有傲骨的靑年、</p>
<p>去年的暑假、他在我們的校裏畢了業、在畢業以前、他是十分高興、欣喜的面容是一天到晚、他在同鄉的宴别會上說、「從今而後、我開始要到社會上去服務、現社會是那麽惡劣、可是我决不向惡劣的社會低頭、我是這樣想、希望諸位同鄉也同此主張、」</p>
<p>他在戴了方帽子、穿了寬腰大袖的黑衣裳、領文憑的時候、他仍是笑容滿面代表畢業同學致答詞說、「今天是一個很可記念的日子、在諸位、是和我們畢業的生離的日子、在我們畢業的、就把人生分爲兩段、把過去的學校生活抛去、算作已往的成績、只有在回憶中追思而已、以後、是我們在社會上奮鬥的日子了、我們仗着我們平日所得、到社會去實騐了、……」</p>
<p>在行過畢業典禮以後的三天、他没有以前的那樣高興了、他把三年半裏所讀過的書籍、通統收進了箱子、可是一天到晚總是異常的忙碌、他的工作、由做文章轉變爲寫信、由讀着轉變爲深思、由運動塲上的跑跳轉變爲仕途上的奔走、他的生活與工作、在畢業後的不久轉變了、</p>
<p>他的臉容、漸由欣喜轉變爲愁悶、因爲他奔走了一個月、結果、還没有找到如意的一個職務、他開始有些失望、知道所學的就不必就是能去應用、</p>
<p>他看到了、要求如意的職業是很困難的、可以遷就的事、也願意遷就了、但是、又是一個月後、就是不如意的職務也没有找到、他有些着慌、由愁悶轉變爲愁苦、他不得不時常去請求他的師長或校長、而師長和校長的回答是「有機會、當代爲設法、」</p>
<p>有一天、他從校長那裏回來、他氣得面都發紅、他受了有生以來的大恥辱、其實、這還是他受屈的開始、</p>
<p>他想起平日在校時、去見校長的時候、校長總是很客氣的、這天、他去校長、他很淸楚的看見校長剛從汽車上出來走進他的公館、接着就去按電鈴、而聽差接了他的名片回報以後出來的回答、說是校長不在、他以爲聽差作怪、他責問他、「校長剛進去、我親眼看到、你豈有此理的搗鬼、」聽差的回答、「先生、你不明白嗎、這是校長謝客的意思、」笑了一笑進去了　　「啊、這是謝客的意思、」他懷疑似的喟歎着走開、回到校裏、身上已經給雨淋得透濕、</p>
<p>從此、他不再相信校長、他立誓不再去請求他了、</p>
<p>光隂很快的去了、暑假、就在他的奔走上淸磨盡、可是職業還没有找到、他到各處打聽消息、回音是不約而同、「此刻、時候已遲、等明年再代爲設法吧、」</p>
<p>他就這樣的失了業、</p>
<p>他雖然還没娶老婆、没有家庭的負担、但是、他的祖上没有雄厚的資産遺下、他的生活費確是生了問題、他爲此而十分焦急、</p>
<p>他因爲生活費的壓迫、他更轉變得利害了、</p>
<p>他請求他的親戚、他的從前的老師時要寫信、白話信、他們是不願意看、或是看不懂、他要迎合他們的歡喜、不得不改白話爲文言、在他做學生時、他極力反對文言、主張白話、現在、不但要四六對偶、並且還要援引古典、一封信寫了兩張八行箋、還没說到應該說的正文、他還把一切名詞、都使它們穿起古裝、如「世界」要寫作「宇宙」等、他有時覺得這是不應該而慚愧、可是白話文在他們是行不通、有什麽辦法呢、祗有向後開倒車、</p>
<p>「眞慚愧、今天又要向人降服、」他聽到有一個曾經被他攢走的教授做了省立大學的教務長、他因爲實在没有路可以走、也祇有老着面皮寫了一封信給他、他感着痛苦而歎氣、在那封信裏、不知寫了多少違反他自己良心的話、可是、等了一個多月還没有回信、</p>
<p>「該死、我眞的昩了良心、我眞的去了廉恥、到如今、我料不到會懇請他的、」在他去拜訪他的故里的一個著名的劣紳以後、深深的感着不安、這樣的懺悔、他非常的懊悔有許多不該說的話都說了出</p>
<h3>硬求婚凍瘡起禍根（張大悲）</h3>
<p>▲中毒·傷心·失眠症·</p>
<p>凍瘡一疾·人皆輕視之而不肯求治·雖有人怕後來之皮破血流·願出小數代價向藥房購藥·而眞方假藥·終不能達到圓滿之結果·所以日前新聞報附刋載有人因凍瘡破爛久不收口而中毒傷身者·又如「生活」週刋六卷七期信箱欄内·載有陳藴玉女士因患了凍瘡不良於行·有碍工作而求治·被醫愈的醫生硬要求婚·以致神經錯亂而患失眠症等·尚有在報上未曾露佈者不知凡幾·於此可見患凍瘡者不少·而其肇事之禍根亦不少·所惜者·大概不知在上海六馬路東新橋科達藥房所發明之「凍敵前」專治凍瘡未爛神效藥·能保險使已患之凍瘡不破爛故也·此乃實在情形·並非有意代爲吹嘘·現今用十二分的誠意·介紹此「凍瘡前」給閱報諸君·又用十二分的誠意請閱報諸君介紹此「凍敵前」給未閱報之朋友親戚鄉隣·使是患凍瘡者·均得搽此藥而又得不破爛·以免再有中毒傷身及有硬求婚之醫生等禍患爲幸·若凍瘡已破爛·則可用「凍敵後」專治已破凍瘡神效藥·功能去腐生新·限日痊愈·切勿失之交臂·坐守自誤爲禱·　庚Ｅ４５２</p>
<p>來、「你老先生是我們地方上的功臣、是我們地方上的父母、老先生的道德文章都足以爲我們後輩的模範、老先生聲望隆重、不知肯不肯提携我這個後輩……」</p>
<p>他轉變了、一個巨大的轉變、大家都這樣的驚異着、</p>
<p>「大學畢業、是愁苦、不是欣喜、」他繼續着失業、這樣的自解、這樣的告訴我們、</p>

<h3>詩人　夢茵</h3>
<p>自從前兩個禮拜詩人沙冰在門房郵欄裏接得一封水紅色美麗的信皮的信以後、他那憂鬱的、苦悶的面孔、現在却常常露出一個得意的笑來、</p>
<p>這眞是一件神密而奇怪的事、凡是住在南明大學的同學莫不知道沙冰一位有名的頽廢詩人、凡是好讀大鳴月刋的人、也莫不知道他是有名的頽廢詩人、的確、沙冰是位頽廢詩人、這不僅是認識的同學、拜讀過他的作品的讀者、是這樣覺得、就是一個無知的陌生者、也是這樣覺得、因爲從他不整齊的服裝、蓬鬆的長髮、瘦弱的身材、憔翠的面容、與夫常常嘆氣、流涙、像瘋子一樣的這些動作上看來、他是位神經病者、</p>
<p>然而近來這位有名的詩人却異樣了、憂鬱的面孔、現在却是喜笑顔開、在外表上、那往日不整齊的服裝、蓬鬆的頭髮、自然是改變了、不整齊的變爲整齊的、蓬鬆的變爲光滑的、就是在他内心的人生觀也不同了、先前是悲觀、消極、沉淪、頽喪……現在却是樂觀、積極、向上、前進、熱愛人生、這、我們可從他的作品、「苦悶的歌聲」「失敗者」「死去罷、我的心、」等轉變到「生之頌歌、」「前進曲」……一類熱烈的情感上看出、至如哭泣、嘆氣、更是少有了、因爲内心的快樂、歡欣、使他知道保養身體之重要、如今他的皮色、面容已是一位飽和着靑春的血液的靑年了、</p>
<p>因此、南明大學的同學、與大鳴月刋的讀者、對於詩人沙冰近來在行動上、作品上有了這一個極端不同的轉變、莫不相傳以爲是神密、奇怪、令好事者百思不得一解、</p>
<p>據說、是天才詩人、其行動都是神密奇怪自有異於常人、如李白跳往水中捉月、尼黑爾以石爲餅、而沙冰的性情前後隔半月之久就判若兩人、大約就是這一類、所以一大半關心詩人沙冰的人、都以爲他近來性情之轉變、乃是由於詩人本身的神密奇怪所致、這、大概是對的罷、</p>
<p>太陽慢慢西埀、像一隻車輪似的高豎在西山之頂、一抹的金光、閃爍地照在大地上、尤其是南明大學的校園内、這時、眞是美麗極了、池水映着陽光、微風吹動、池面現出波紋、靑葱的樹枝、發出沙沙歌音、詩人沙冰坐在池邊的草地上、他手拿着一個撕破了的美麗水紅色的信封、一張信箋掉落在他膝下、這信、正是他剛才從門房郵欄上拿來的信、是一位署名倩影女士寫給他的信、是内容恭維他是一位天才詩人的信、他看完後、心在跳、血液在奔流、終於使他哭的面孔笑了、</p>
<p>從這天起、詩人沙冰便每天到門房郵欄處拿信、（自然有時拿不着）每天到校園裏看信、每天在宿舍裏寫信、也是從這天起、詩人沙冰改變了他的人生觀、改變了他的藝術觀、使大多數認識他的人懷疑他、因而有人說是詩人本質神密、奇怪的原故上去、</p>
<p>這兒我們不要責備詩人沙冰是這樣糊塗、或是說他太不値得、爲了一個女人竟使他顚狂若此、原來他今年廿五歲了、還没有找得愛人、詩人而没有愛人、這成其爲詩人嗎、因爲無論在生活上、作品上、愛人之於詩人、實在是很重要、而况沙冰今年廿五歲了呢、因此詩人沙冰常常嘆息着、怨恨天下女人太没有眼睛、放着這樣多情的詩人不愛、而去愛一般的俗物、我們若說、詩人沙冰以先其所以悲觀、沉淪、腦經像瘋子樣、完全是爲着没有女人的安慰、是没有一點過分的、而現在他因爲得了女人的信、快樂、高興起來、也是當然的、只可憐那些不知道詩人沙冰的心的人、硬拿許多牛頭不對馬嘴的傳說、來推測他、眞是寃哉枉也、</p>
<p>一天下午、詩人沙冰又坐在校園裏、也是在看剛從門房郵欄裏拿來的信、正看起勁的時候、忽地他面站着兩位同學、</p>
<p>「喂、沙詩人、你在看什麽、看得這樣</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>熱心、」</p>
<p>「哦」、詩人嚇得一驚、抬起頭來、看是全校聞名喜歡開玩笑的張與王連忙說</p>
<p>「没爲什麽、讀着自己的作二、」</p>
<p>「自己的作品嗎、」王說、手指着那掉在地上的紅信封、「明明你是讀着信、看、這不是信封嗎、」</p>
<p>「哈哈、情書、情書、我們公開看一下、張拉着詩人沙冰的手、</p>
<p>詩人的臉紅了、他不會撒謊、連忙說「你們不要看信、待我說出來是一樣、」於是詩人便把這事的原委統統都告訴他們、他說這位女子信寫得如何流俐、多情、對於他的人格、作品、又非常了解、末了、他說、</p>
<p>「只是我們還没有會面、唉、可惜、…………」</p>
<p>「你想不想與她會面呢、」王搭訕的說、</p>
<p>「當然的、不過我没有寫信同她商量、」</p>
<p>「好、我去呌她同你會面、」張慷慨地說、</p>
<p>詩人正預備問張知不知道她、可是他們倆却好像忍不住笑似的走開了、</p>
<p>第二天詩人當眞的接着一封她約他到三星花園相會的信、時間是「卽日下午六時」這眞是使詩人沙冰喜歡高興極了、差不多是從來所未有的、當課上完之後、詩人慌忙地走回宿舍、換西裝、抹反鞋、疏頭髮、正在這樣作着異於尋常的舉動時、許多同學都對他抛來無數的希奇神密的眼光來、</p>
<p>「沙詩人你在忙什麽、」一個姓李的同學問、</p>
<p>「哼、哼、」詩人没心思回答、只把鼻子嗡兩聲、於是這討了没趣的李說、</p>
<p>「神秘、神秘」第三還是神秘、」</p>
<p>其餘的同學也說、「這樣的動作就是詩人嗎、」他們好像因了詩人沙冰態度之奇怪、而對其他一切詩人都懷疑了起來、　　然而詩人沙冰却無心顧及到這些問題了、</p>
<p>忙着出了一身熱汗、好容易才把領結打好、西裝穿上、頭毛疏光、重新在鏡子前照了一照、認爲是十分地滿意了、然後挾了他的一本近作原稿、（這是預備帶給他愛人看的、作爲他的見面禮、因爲這部作品裏是他轉變後、歌頌愛神的産生、）出校門了、未走出校以先、他還找了王同張、預備問問他們到底認不認識他愛人……可是一位姓陳的同學告訴他、王張二人早已出去了、</p>
<p>在途中、詩人曾想到許多問題、他想到第一次見面、該怎樣稱呼她、是稱密司、還是直截了當稱愛人呢、他想她到底不知是位怎樣的女子、漂亮不漂亮、中不中他的意、他又想到……想到很多、他自己也記不淸楚了、</p>
<p>恰恰是六點鐘時、他走進三星公園、在一個小亭子内、張首先喊他、</p>
<p>「沙詩人、這裏來、」他隨聲音朝亭子内一望、看見了張、而且旁邊坐了一位穿紅旗袍的女子、詩人心裏一跳、連忙走進亭子來、</p>
<p>「累你們久等、對不起、」詩人走進亭子裏、行了一個六十度鞠躬禮、他看見那女子背對他、動也不動、詩人爲了自尊心、不禁恨起他愛人來、然而隨卽恕了她、「也許是害羞吧、……」</p>
<p>（待我來介紹、這位是你所愛慕的詩人沙冰先生、這就是寫信給你的愛人……」張伸手去拉那女子、自己却忍不住笑起來、而那女子也哈哈地大笑、她轉身嬌聲說、「沙詩人、我最最親愛的人兒呵……」</p>
<p>詩人沙冰氣得頽然倒坐在亭内、他慢慢地像哼詩樣地說、</p>
<p>「我眞不知你們爲什麽要這樣地作弄我」</p>
<p>原來那常常署名女子寫信給詩人的、是張王二人閙的把戲、今天扮女的也是王的化裝、</p>
<p>自此以後、詩人沙冰又恢復了從前的態度、南明的同學、及大鳴月刋的讀者　　常　詩人的神秘與奇</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Gale and Heavy Snow</h3>
<p>Since last winter, there have been frequent reports of severe cold and earthquakes around the world. The changes in weather have been more frequent than in previous years. Now that it is spring, it is a time of changing weather patterns, and so there are reports of natural disasters again. According to a report from Basel, the Alps Mountains in Switzerland, France, and Italy have experienced unprecedented heavy snow, completely blocking transportation and trapping hundreds of villages and towns in the mountains. Officials from the four countries are doing their best to restore transportation. According to a report from Paris, there are still violent storms in the Mediterranean Sea. A French torpedo boat and a passenger seaplane are trapped in the storm. Although four destroyers and a tugboat were sent to rescue them, they could not approach due to the heavy waves. From these two events, it can be seen that the abnormality of the weather is not only a characteristic of recent times, but also the changes in people's minds.</p>
<p>The theory of interaction between heaven and humanity has always attributed the prevalence of natural disasters to improper human affairs, and has especially used natural disasters to issue warnings. In fact, in my opinion, the weather and human affairs are inherently consistent. When the earth's movement enters an atmosphere of disharmony, the climate becomes violent and people's hearts become more restless. The ancient people spoke of the influence of tears, which is not only limited to one person or one place, but is prevalent throughout the world. However, if mankind can calm down and use consciousness to overcome the atmosphere of sensation and not be moved by it, then the world will be at peace. This is what the ancient people called "man can conquer nature."</p>

<p>Important Foreign Dispatches</p>
<h3>Anglo-American-Japanese Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>▲ Tending to become a Five-Power Treaty</p>
<p>France and Britain reach agreement first</p>
<p>Italian attitude worthy of attention</p>
<p>British representative rushes to Rome</p>
<p>Raising French speculation</p>
<p>Germany will demand the same principles</p>
<p>Public opinion deeply uneasy</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 24th: The London Naval Treaty signed last year by the United States, Britain, and Japan is now tending to become a five-power treaty. Its success depends on Italy. Britain and France have generally agreed on the conditions for France to join the treaty. If Italy also joins, the treaty can be signed. If Italy refuses, the Anglo-French agreement will naturally not be established because Britain has not yet recognized France's proposed guarantee that it can act freely if Italy increases its naval construction. The above news was obtained from British sources this afternoon. This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Briand hosted a banquet for the British Foreign Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty. Tonight, the British Foreign Secretary and others will depart for Rome to discuss this entire issue with the Italian government.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 24th: The situation of the Anglo-French naval negotiations has changed several times in one day. The French government was deeply convinced at noon that the two sides would be able to sign the draft agreement before midnight, but the meeting was adjourned at dusk. The British Foreign Secretary Henderson, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, and experts departed late at night and rushed to Rome. According to their claim, the negotiations have reached a stage where it is necessary to consult with the Italian government. However, the French political circles felt as if a thunderbolt had struck them regarding the departure of the British representative and did not know what the true intention was. Some said that it showed that everything had been agreed upon, while others said that it indicated that the negotiations had reached a deadlock. The evening newspapers also warned the people not to be too optimistic.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 25th: The public's discussion of the naval reduction plan is paying great attention to the British representative's sudden departure for Rome. It is said that Britain and France have completely agreed on this matter, and only Italy's approval is required for a concrete solution. Some say that the British representative has also indicated that Italy will certainly not disagree. French official reports claim that the United States and Japan are fully aware of the progress of this negotiation.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 24th: German newspapers have lengthy commentaries on the Anglo-French navies, mostly feeling uneasy and deeply concerned that Britain will exchange major concessions on land disarmament for the naval ratios of France and Italy, so that in the future, the French will be able to do whatever they want in the International Disarmament Conference with the secret support of the British. If this is the case, then the conference will inevitably lead to no results. The German government has now reiterated its previous proposal, strongly advocating the principle of equality in land disarmament, otherwise, it will have to withdraw from the League of Nations, because Germany should also obtain the same security as other countries.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Debates Naval Budget</h3>
<p>Government Fails on Unemployment Relief Bill</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 24th: The French Parliament opened today to discuss the naval budget. The opposition parties vehemently attacked the government, and the debate was intense. Socialist Member of Parliament Chaffard claimed that the total spent on the army and navy reached 19 billion francs, which is three times that of 1914. Radical Party leader Daladier claimed that even if such a huge amount of money is used to support the military, its efficiency is declining daily, even less than Italy and Germany. Army Chief of Staff Maginot defended vigorously, saying that military spending had indeed reached the point where it could not be reduced, otherwise, the security of the country would be endangered. He also discussed the situation of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, saying that France's border defense forces would never be allowed to be reduced by a large amount. If it is desired to amend the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, the French cannot agree.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 25th: Newspapers today discussed the failure of the Laval Cabinet regarding the Socialist Party's proposal to increase unemployment relief from 25 million francs to 100 million francs. Left-wing newspapers declared that the Cabinet, after the failure of this bill, has a fundamental reason to be concerned about shaking and it is not necessary to hide it. Right-wing newspapers said that this fact is not of great importance because no no-confidence motion has been pursued after the bill was submitted.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Financial Negotiations</h3>
<p>Focus on Foreign Loans</p>
<p>Specific Measures Under Preparation</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 24th: The British Treasury Department issued an article stating that during the discussions between British and French treasury officials in the past two months, both sides acknowledged the urgent need to focus on creditor countries to restore the normal scope of foreign lending and acknowledged that current lending difficulties are mostly due to investors' lack of confidence in debtors. Therefore, borrowing countries must do their best to restore this confidence. The League of Nations previously resolved to begin a detailed discussion to make it easier for agricultural loans to be raised in Central and Eastern Europe. As for specific measures, experts are currently preparing them. The talks between British and French treasury officials did not intend to establish concrete international agreements on certain events but to establish a contact on events that are of great relevance to British and French financial economics. This kind of contact should be maintained, and opinions should be exchanged at any time. When Britain and France discussed, they were frank and friendly with each other. They considered the reasons for the very unusual cash flow between London and Paris. The French authorities also did not welcome this kind of flow and were extremely eager to avoid actions that could promote this kind of flow as much as possible. The French Treasury Department does not admit that its method of managing French public funds has a force that promotes the influx of cash into France but is willing to examine the repercussions of its method implementation on financial market conditions according to its own needs. Both sides believe that the British and French Treasury Departments should come into contact with the various issues arising from the report of the League of Nations Gold Committee. The French authorities have repeatedly expressed their willingness to promote foreign lending in the Paris market. Subsequent actions will promote cooperation in effectiveness to facilitate borrowers and can slightly reduce the current market depression. Therefore, all possibilities regarding this level will be studied one by one.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Government Established in Southern Peru</h3>
<p>Cusco Troops Join in Response</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 25th: A dispatch from Lima, the capital of Peru, said that the rebels in southern Peru have established their own government, and the troops in Cusco have also responded. According to reports, riots broke out in Lima on February 20. A team of armed citizens attacked the Presidential Palace and were driven back by the guards. They fled to a town several miles west of Lima. Sixty people died in the battle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Fights Government's Suppression of Speech</h3>
<p>Proletarian Members of Parliament Extremely Indignant</p>
<p>Hamaguchi Tries His Physical Strength in Preparation for Attendance</p>
<p>Japanese Economic Circles Affected by the Silver Market</p>
<p>Questions Raised at the Noble House Budget Committee</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th: Tetsuya Katayama of the Social People's Party originally intended to make a fierce inquiry to the government authorities for the benefit of the working masses when the Labor Union Bill was being deliberated at the plenary session of the House of Representatives yesterday. However, the inquiry was blocked, and even the speech on the progress of the deliberations was rejected. Members of Parliament from various proletarian factions were extremely indignant. After the plenary session adjourned, they met with Speaker Fujisawa to blame him for his impropriety. At the same time, they issued the following statement: "The government has proposed the Labor Union Control Law and the Dispute Suppression Law in this era of economic panic. The politicians and civilians of both parties have completely blocked the speeches of proletarian members of parliament through the agreement of the faction negotiations meeting and wasted time with reactionary arguments. We cannot remain silent about this violent act and the anti-proletarian attitude of the two parties. We are determined to unite the working masses and fight to the death."</p>
<p>▲ Japan Allied, Tokyo, 25th: The date of Hamaguchi's attendance is gradually receding. At 7:30 last night, he tested the durability of his body at his official residence. Salt and Manabe, the two attending physicians, were also present. First, he shouted the words "Gentlemen!" to check whether the pronunciation had any impact on the injured part. Then he practiced moving up and down the stairs. The results were excellent and could withstand four or five hours of intense work a day.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th: At today's General Meeting of the Budget of the Noble House, Mr. Fukao of the Justice Society asked, "The Japanese economic community has also been greatly affected by the sharp drop in silver prices. I believe that the sharp drop in silver is manipulated by people. Are there any countermeasures?" Minister of Finance Inoue replied, "Countermeasures are currently being studied by various countries. According to my investigation, the reason for the sharp drop in silver is due to India's reform of the monetary system and the excess silver in Shanghai. The government currently has no special good policy." Fukao said, "Regarding India's sale of silver, I hope the government will negotiate with the British government to find a response method. Purchasing cheap silver is also a countermeasure, and it can also strengthen national defense."</p>
<h3>Details of the Plot to Murder the Cuban President</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Havana, Cuba, 24th: Details of yesterday's plot to murder the Cuban president have now been released. A guard lowered a time-bomb through the vent, which fell into the president's bathroom, scheduled to explode at 4:30 in the morning, because the president would be taking a morning bath at that time. However, the time bomb did not fall to its destination but exploded in the room above the president's bathroom, so the president was not injured, but it was close. The security is now extremely tight to protect the president's safety, and guards are densely deployed around the presidential palace.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Executive Committee</h3>
<p>▲ Passes Resolution on the Indian Question</p>
<p>Mosley's Activities Separate from the Labour Party</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 24th: The Executive Committee of the National Conservative Party held a meeting this afternoon. Although the Indian question was not on its agenda, it was raised in the form of an emergency motion. Party leader Baldwin did not attend, and not many Members of Parliament were present. Churchill and Neville Chamberlain were present. Rockingham proposed that the Indian incident was extremely important and that the Conservative Party should be fully mobilized to make a strong claim to maintain law and order. Churchill seconded and spoke very emotionally. The motion was then passed unanimously.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 24th: Yesterday, it was rumored that Mosley and others would announce their departure from the Labour Party at today's Labour Party meeting and would form a National Socialist Party. However, it is now learned that this faction will form another faction in the House of Commons. Whether to leave the Labour Party or not will be a matter of free action for each individual. It is difficult to predict whether this decision will be in line with the views of the Labour Party Executive Committee. Some quarters believe that the new developments in Mosley's faction's activities will be regarded as actions involving party discipline. If Mosley and others do not voluntarily leave the party, the Labour Party may demand that they leave the party. Mosley has now sent two letters to party leader MacDonald, declaring his departure from the Parliamentary Labour Party. However, whether he wants to resign from his position as a Member of Parliament is unknown. Mosley issued his new declaration today, the gist of which is similar to the declaration he issued a few months ago, namely, organizing a five-person emergency cabinet to carry out national plans and establishing agencies to develop new industries and revitalize existing industries.</p>
<h3>Spanish Municipal and Rural Elections</h3>
<p>To be Held on April 12</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Madrid, 24th: The Spanish government convened a second cabinet meeting today and decided that the national municipal and rural elections will be held on April 12 and canceled the previous cabinet order to suspend classes at universities for four weeks. The provincial elections and constitutional conference elections have not yet been scheduled.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Storms Continue</h3>
<p>Heavy Snow in the Alps</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 25th: The Mediterranean is still experiencing violent storms. The French torpedo boat Batalaisse was damaged by the storm and drifted with the waves and has sent urgent telegrams for help everywhere. Four destroyers and a tugboat were dispatched to rescue it, but they could not get close due to the strong waves and returned. In addition, a French passenger seaplane was forced to land due to the strong winds and was tossed by the waves, which was extremely dangerous. The ships that went to rescue it could only be seen but not reached due to the violent storms and winds.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Basel, 24th: The Alps between Switzerland, France, Austria, and Italy have encountered unprecedented heavy snow, and traffic is completely blocked. Hundreds of villages and towns are trapped in the mountains. The Swiss railway authorities have used all snowplows on the Saint Gotthard line to barely maintain traffic between Italy and Switzerland. The Italian authorities have also transferred all the troops stationed in the mountains to maintain traffic in the garrisons because landslides occur in the mountains from time to time, and the location of each garrison is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from Nanchang: All newspaper offices are requested to note that former Division Commander Zhang Zan sacrificed his life in Longgang, and an order has been issued regarding all matters after the death of the former Division Commander, which should be properly handled by the provincial government.

<p>###豫皖鄂邊勦匪實施會在漢舉行</p>
<p>▲ 吉鴻昌任追勦總指揮</p>
<p>▲ 行營已下令定期總攻</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Wuhan Headquarters held another bandit suppression meeting on the 18th of this month. Detailed resolutions were made regarding methods of improvement and unified orders, and have been telegraphed to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for record and circulated to all armies for implementation. However, a meticulous plan for the implementation of the bandit suppression in the border area of Henan, Anhui and Hubei has not yet been discussed. Li Mingzhong, Pacification Commissioner of the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border area, took the opportunity while the generals had not yet returned to their defenses and convened another bandit suppression implementation meeting for the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border area. The meeting was held at 7:00 PM on the 21st. Those in attendance were Li Mingzhong, Ji Hongchang (represented by Zhang Yinxiang), Xia Douyin (represented by Zhu Huaibing), Fan Xiji, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Dai Minquan (represented by Xu Liding), Pan Shanzhai, Zhu Chuanjing, Chen Guangzu, Wang Zhenhuai, Xu Xiancha, and over ten other people. Li Mingzhong chaired the meeting, reporting on the significance and special characteristics of the meeting, (1) exchanging opinions and reporting on the bandit suppression situation of each department, (2) thoroughly improving bandit suppression methods to eliminate them as soon as possible, (3) studying ways to reduce the suffering of soldiers in combat. After the report, various proposals were discussed. Due to the strict confidentiality, the specifics are unknown. The final decision was to divide the border area bandit suppression into two types: pursuit and defense. The forces of Xia Douyin, Fan Xiji, Ge Yunlong, and Pan Shanzhai were designated to defend key locations, attacking bandits on sight, while the forces of Ji Hongchang and Zhang Yinxiang were to be responsible for pursuit, with Ji Hongchang appointed as the commander-in-chief of the pursuit. As for bandit suppression expenses, it was decided that the provinces would be responsible for the troops stationed in their respective provinces. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM. Fan Xiji, Ge Yunlong, Zhang Yinxiang, Pan Shanzhai, and others returned to their defenses on the 22nd to oversee the suppression. Furthermore, the pacification headquarters of the three provinces issued orders to all troops on the 24th for a scheduled general offensive. The main points of the order stated that the remaining bandits in the three provinces are currently gathering around Mabu in Liu'an. All troops must establish effective communication and implement strict defenses. The elite forces of Ji Hongchang and Zhang Yinxiang were tasked with pursuit, constructing strong fortifications at appropriate locations, with Ji serving as the commander-in-chief of the pursuit, responsible for the pursuit operations. Any recovered areas were to immediately begin post-conflict management and assist the county magistrates in conducting rural cleansing, organizing the populace, and implementing the Baojia system. It was also necessary to strictly prohibit the people from paying ransom to the bandits. As for the forces of Ge Yunlong, Xia Douyin, Fan Xiji, Pan Shanzhai, and others, they were stationed at various key locations to serve as blockades to prevent bandits from fleeing. For added security, Ge Yunlong and Zhang Yinxiang's divisions were specifically ordered to establish effective communication with Zhao Guantao's troops stationed in Xinyang, Li Dingwu's troops stationed in Guangshui, and Yue Weijun's troops stationed in Huayuan during the suppression period to jointly blockade and suppress as opportunities arose. As for the locations of the defensive troops, Ge Yunlong's troops were to defend the counties in eastern Hubei, Fan Shisheng, Xia Douyin, and Zhang Yinxiang's troops were to defend the counties in northern Hubei, and Fan Xiji and Pan Shanzhai's troops were to defend the counties on the Anhui border. Pan's troops, currently stationed around Qishui and Qichun, will soon return to Yingshan. Within three to five days, the defenses of each unit will be concentrated according to the designated locations. Once the concentration is complete, a general attack order will be issued.

<h3>桂局和平實現後</h3>

<p>▲ 八路軍逐漸班師</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Huang Shaoxiong, Wu Tingyang, and Chen Jitang successively entered Beijing, there has been a concrete solution for resolving the situation in Guangxi. The Guangxi provincial troops will be reorganized into a security force. Huang and Wu will</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>News in Brief</p>
<p>return to Guangxi in the coming days to oversee all matters related to the downsizing and reorganization. Afterwards, bandit suppression will be the sole responsibility of the Pacification Commissioner (all reorganized troops will also be under the command and control of the Pacification Commissioner). (The Pacification Commissioner's office will be organized according to the regulations promulgated by the central government. The Guangxi troops currently under the Eighth Route Army (such as the newly organized 1st Division under Zhu Weizhen, the Pingle 9th Prefecture Commander under Lu Dingxiang, the Xunzhou Security Commander under Chen Xianjue, the newly organized 16th Division under Yang Dingzhong, and the miscellaneous troops under Shen Rongguang and Cen Mengda) are currently facing unresolved problems regarding their reassignment. According to outside sources, it is said that the above-mentioned troops were only temporarily incorporated into the Eighth Route Army during wartime to reduce the enemy's strength. If the Guangxi Post-War Pacification Commissioner's Office is established, they may be reassigned to the Pacification Office for demobilization, which is not yet known. As peace has been achieved, there is no need for the Eighth Route Army to remain in Guangxi any longer. They have recently begun to withdraw in stages. The withdrawal process will start by withdrawing the Eighth Route Army stationed in Wuzhou and Dahe back to Guangdong Province, vacating the defense areas so that the Eighth Route Army on the Binyang front can gradually withdraw. As for the attached or supplementary troops of various divisions and brigades, they will first gather the cadres in the defense areas to facilitate their return to their units and departure. In recent days, various units have been moving around in preparation for their triumphant return. It is reported that the 126th Brigade under Huang Zhiwen has already returned from the front lines to Wuzhou. A portion of the Huang Renhuan Brigade, as well as the regiments of Zhang Zhiying, Chen Hanguang, and Zeng Youren, departed from Litang to Guixian on the 17th, taking multiple civilian ships, and passing through Pingnan and Mengjiang. The Huang Brigade's headquarters and directly subordinate units also departed at the same time and are expected to assemble today. As for the Yu Hanmou Division at the front lines, except for a portion left to defend Binyang, the Li Zhenqiu Regiment has gradually returned to Guixian. In the future, the Li Yangjing Brigade of the 63rd Division may be the first to withdraw entirely. The Huang Zhiwen Brigade of that division is expected to return from eastern Wuzhou during the day, followed by the Huang Renhuan Brigade of the independent brigade, with the Yu Division bringing up the rear. It is heard that the people of Guangxi believe that since the Eighth Route Army has been stationed in Guangxi for so long, there should be some expression of gratitude upon their withdrawal. Therefore, a certain organization has been preparing a grand celebration to send off the Eighth Route Army in triumph and plans to present commemorative flags to various units in the name of the celebration to express their gratitude.

<h3>贛共匪撲攻吉安泰和</h3>
<p>▲ 公秉藩師將羅匪擊潰</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: On the 17th of this month, the Communist bandit Luo Binghui in the central section of the Gan River led the pseudo 20th Army directly towards the Ji'an-Taihe line. Fortunately, Gong Bingshen, commander of the 28th Division, made thorough arrangements, with the Wang Brigade holding the Qingyuan Mountain bridgehead area. The Wu and Yang regiments of the Chai Qiaosong Brigade in the center were to meet up in the Fenghuangwei area, while the Minquan gunboats patrolled places like Zhangjiadu. At the time, the Communist bandits numbered about five to six thousand people with three to four thousand firearms, attempting to forcibly cross the river. Brigade Commander Wang then led his troops in a fierce attack, and the Minquan gunboats also opened fire, bombarding the bandits. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and retreated into the mountains on the riverbank. Several hundred Communist bandits were killed on the spot, and the remaining bandits scattered. Commander Gong then transferred the Wu Regiment to Ji'an and the Yang Regiment to Taihe as outposts to strengthen the defenses. Also, the Ma Kun Brigade of the 34th Brigade of the 12th Division, after arriving in the Xinfeng area, joined forces with Wang Kui, the commander of the Xinfeng County Security Guards, and recovered Xinfeng County on the 21st, making contact with the 19th Route Army. The Communist bandits' pseudo 22nd, 25th, and 35th Armies retreated towards the Yudu area.</p>
<p>It is heard that the central government believes that to fundamentally eliminate Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, it is necessary to start with politics and party affairs. Therefore, it is expected to announce Qiu as the head of the Jiangxi Wartime Political Affairs Office to handle all political affairs and post-war reconstruction in the bandit areas and newly recovered counties. In addition to actively rectifying military discipline and conduct, Minister He is also paying special attention to the political situation in the province. Yesterday, he ordered the provincial government to compile and submit all political information about the province to the headquarters so that it can be reviewed by the Councilors' Hall. This is because during wartime, all party, government, and military affairs are handled by the General Headquarters. (February 22)</p>
<h3>湘共匪蹂躪二十四縣</h3>
<p>▲ 中央賑委會撥四萬元辦賑</p>
<p>▲ 湘政府亦撥四萬分配各縣</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Since the Communist bandit Peng Dehuai captured Changsha on July 27th of last year, the bandit forces have greatly expanded. Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, He Kuang and other bandits have all used their full strength to invade Hunan. Twenty-four counties were occupied by bandits, accounting for almost one-third of the entire province. The loss of people's lives and property is incalculable. Refugees are everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Some counties were even captured by bandits three or four times. The Hunan Provincial Government, the Provincial Relief Committee, and various public organizations have repeatedly telegraphed the central government, pleading for the allocation of 10 million yuan in post-war reconstruction bonds for relief and post-war use. However, the central government did not approve the allocation due to financial difficulties. Recently, the Central Relief Commission finally allocated 40,000 yuan in emergency relief funds and sent Commissioner Lin Binghua to Hunan with the funds to conduct on-site investigations of the disaster situation and distribute the funds accordingly. Commissioner Lin arrived in Hunan several days ago and found that no fewer than forty counties in Hunan Province had suffered from bandit disasters. Twenty-four counties were especially hard hit, suffering heavily from being captured by bandits. Each county had no fewer than tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. How could such a small amount of 40,000 yuan provide relief? Therefore, he consulted with He Jian, Finance Director Zhang Kailian, and Civil Affairs Director Cao Bowen to have the provincial government allocate an additional 40,000 yuan in relief funds, for a total of 80,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Hunan Provincial Relief Committee for distribution. The Provincial Relief Committee then convened a joint meeting yesterday morning, inviting the two directors Zhang and Cao, as well as Commissioner Lin, to attend to discuss the relief distribution plan. At the meeting, the staff of the Provincial Relief Committee reported that, according to the committee's investigation, the losses in the twenty-four counties most deeply ravaged by bandits were no less than 100 million, and the number of disaster victims was over one million. It was impossible to provide relief with such a small amount of funds. After much discussion, it was finally decided that in addition to telegraphing the central government to request an emergency relief of 4 to 5 million yuan to save the disaster victims, the 80,000 yuan would be temporarily distributed as follows: (1) Pingjiang, Liuyang, Yiyong, and Rucheng counties, which were captured by bandits more than three times, each suffered losses of over 10 million, and each had approximately 100,000 or more disaster victims, were each allocated 5,000 yuan in relief funds, for a total of 20,000 yuan. (2) Shimen, Linxian, Tongdao, Wugang, Yueyang, Xiangyin, Nanxian, Xinning, Suining, Chengbu, Jingxian, Linxiang, Liling, Changsha, Lingxian, Jianghua, Yongxing, Daoxian, Zixing, and Anren counties, which were captured by bandits more than once, each suffered losses of over 1 million, and each had approximately 50,000 or more disaster victims, were each allocated 3,000 yuan in relief funds, for a total of 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Because there were too many disaster victims in Hunan Province, and there were also nearly 10,000 refugees from Pingjiang and Liuyang living in Changsha, the provincial capital, each of whom was given half a liter of rice and fourteen copper coins per day by the Provincial Relief Committee, which could not be sustained for long. Therefore, He Jian consulted with the provincial government's committee members to determine a method for accommodating the disaster victims: (1) Request the Ministry of Railways to accelerate the construction of the Yuehan Railway according to the completed plan to provide work-for-relief and accommodate the disaster victims. Hunan Province is willing to advance 50,000 yuan in wages per month. (2) Build the Chang-Ping-Liu automobile road, both to facilitate military transportation and to provide work for the refugees from Pingjiang and Liuyang so that they would not starve or freeze to death. (3) Transfer the disaster victims to the Northwest for reclamation and cultivation. The Department of Civil Affairs has been ordered to formulate a plan for implementation. However, this matter requires a large amount of funds, and the central government has been telegraphed to allocate 1 million yuan in relief funds specifically for this purpose. (February 21)</p>
<h3>哈商會議减低運費</h3>
<p>▲ 東滿兩路運費隨金價飛漲</p>
<p>▲ 各團體會議决定運動减低</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The price of gold has soared since the beginning of the month, and the freight rates of the Eastern Railway and the Southern Manchurian Railway have also been repeatedly increased accordingly. Although the Eastern Railway issued new shipping regulations on February 1st, appropriately reducing the freight rates on various routes, the converted silver price was still higher than before. Harbin merchants believe that the period after the New Year is the import season for spring goods. With such high freight rates on the Eastern and Southern Manchurian Railways, there is no opportunity to purchase goods. Therefore, on the 14th of this month, the Chamber of Commerce of Daoli City first invited the Chamber of Commerce of Daowai to hold a consultation. It was decided that at 10:00 AM on the 19th, the Chambers of Commerce of Daoli and Daowai would jointly convene various organizations at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss ways to reduce freight rates on the Eastern and Southern Manchurian Railways. At 10:30 AM on the 19th, two or three representatives from seven organizations, including the Daoli and Daowai Oil Mill Guild, the Grain Industry Guild, and the Sundries Guild, gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss and decided on two items: (A) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce would be responsible for drafting a petition listing three reasons: (1) During the eighth year of the Republic (1919), the Eastern Railway and Southern Manchurian Railway used the excuse of low gold prices to increase freight rates by 100%. At the time, the business community had no objections. Now that gold prices have soared, in terms of theory and sentiment, the Eastern Railway and Southern Manchurian Railway should also respect the opinions of industry and commerce and appropriately reduce rates to prevent Harbin merchants from being bound by gold-based freight rates. (2) Since the gold rush occurred, the prices of various merchants' goods have fallen sharply, but the freight rates of the Eastern Railway and Southern Manchurian Railway have not been reduced at all. In terms of sentiment and reason, this is not fair. In order to take the overall situation into account, the two railways should use the merchants' falling goods prices as the benchmark to reduce freight rates. (3) The Eastern Railway and Southern Manchurian Railway earn gold coins, spend gold coins, and purchase materials with gold coins. Currently, due to the gold surge, the prices of goods worldwide have been reduced, and the materials used by the railways must also be reduced. Therefore, after the Eastern Railway and Southern Manchurian Railway reduce freight rates, there will be no damage to themselves. Based on these reasons, it is also appropriate to reduce rates. This petition will be submitted on the 25th of this month. Each organization will send four or five people to gather at the Daoli Municipal Chamber of Commerce to personally deliver it to the Eastern Railway Bureau and the Southern Manchurian Railway's Harbin Office and request a reply. (B) If the petition is ineffective, then petition the authorities to issue 10 million yuan in silver public bonds to build a railway section from Harbin to Taonan so that it can be connected to the state-owned railways. In the future, goods from the interior can be transported to northern Manchuria without going through the Manchurian-Eastern Railways, and Chinese merchants can also avoid being bound by the Manchurian-Eastern Railways' gold-based freight rates. According to reports, the land route from Harbin to Taonan is flat and without any mountains or valleys. The distance between the two places is over 1,300 li (Chinese miles), passing through Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Daqing in Heilongjiang Province, and Anguang in Liaoning Province. If this is completed, the transportation network in the Northeast will become more comprehensive. (February 20)</p>

<h3>林白克努力促成銀借欵</h3>
<p>▲ 在美上書華爾什氏</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch: Lin Baek, advisor to the National Government, has been lobbying everywhere in the United States for silver loans, vigorously promoting them. Recently, he wrote a letter to Mr. Walsh, stating that after their meeting this morning, there were still some ideas he wanted to express. He stated that the proposal to lend silver to China is an emergency method to increase trade with China and contain communism. This is an unprecedented move with no precedent to follow. The current drop in silver prices is due to the gold mine owners using legislative power to reject the use of silver, thereby suppressing silver prices so that they cannot compete with gold prices. This has led to all major countries in the world disdaining silver for use as currency, and Westerners also worship gold and despise silver. However, the Chinese and Indians still trust silver and regard it as a valuable item. The writer traveled through the provinces of the Yangtze River basin last year and saw that there was very little silver in circulation among the people. The currency used was still mainly copper coins. China is transitioning from the copper coin era to the silver coin era, and it is currently facing a shortage of money. Because there is no silver to purchase agricultural products, farmers cannot sell their products. Because there is no silver to run industries, workers are idle and unemployed. Once silver is loaned to China and distributed among the twenty-six provinces, it will be able to absorb 2 billion ounces, and half of it will be stored as treasure. Therefore, 1 billion ounces of standby funds can be completely absorbed overnight. After lending silver to China, due to the development of trade in China, it will be sufficient to absorb raw silver, and silver prices will rise. As for international conferences, they are far away and difficult to achieve results. It is better to lend money to China, which is easier to achieve results. And since China and the United States have cooperated, the people's livelihood in China will gradually improve, so communism will not develop in China.</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Military Police Launch Another Large-Scale Bandit Suppression Campaign: The 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Security Force, led by Battalion Commander Bai Jizhi, along with the troops of Battalion Commander Zhang of the 5th Division, and the land and water police forces of Songjiang and Jinshan counties, previously approved the decision made at the Zhangyan bandit suppression conference. They, together with the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Corps, jointly launched a bandit suppression operation on the 24th to search for bandit traces. That evening, they camped in Jinmiao, Liujia Yan Bridge and other places. As a result of the search, more than sixty suspects with suspicious profiles were captured and taken back for interrogation and handling. On the 25th, Cao Pang, the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force, personally led his troops to the countryside, arriving at Qianjiawei. He also cooperated with various units to launch a joint suppression, setting off in different directions. The areas where bandits congregated were surrounded under the command of Xu Pucheng, the District Chief of the Water Police, Zhao, the Battalion Commander of the Zhejiang Security Corps, and District Chief Zhou, so as to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The ports on the land and water routes were blockaded, and the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police dispatched two shallow-water gunboats to patrol back and forth, which was very thorough.</p>
<p>Military Police Deploy to Prevent Refugees: Zhang Baoyuan, the patrol officer of the Xiaokunshan sub-station, learned that a large number of refugees would invade Songjiang from the Qingpu County border, with rumors of as many as several thousand. Fearing that this would disturb the local area due to the small size of Xiaokunshan and that the police force would be too weak to resist, he specially sent people to Songjiang to report to the county magistrate and police chief. It was requested that the regiment headquarters dispatch a company to cooperate with the county police force to immediately go to the countryside to prevent them from entering.</p>
<p>Extension Granted for Grain Collection in This County: The collection of grain tax in this county was originally scheduled to end on the 26th of the second month. This year, due to continuous rain on the way before the deadline, the amount collected was insufficient. It has been approved by the county government's finance bureau to the provincial finance department to extend the deadline to the 8th of the third month.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Public Cinema: Kunshan is located on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, making transportation convenient. However, it lacks public entertainment venues, which is a major shortcoming. Zhang Lian, Tao Mengzhao, Wang Guanren and other locals, therefore, initiated the establishment of a public cinema. The cinema is located in the former Xinyang County government office. It will feature high-quality and novel Chinese films for public entertainment. The cinema held its opening ceremony yesterday and invited personnel from various agencies to visit.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>

<p>County Government Holds District Chief Conference: The county government of this county held a district chief conference yesterday (the 24th) to discuss matters related to rural cleanup. The minutes of the meeting are recorded below: (1) Regarding the establishment of rural sub-bureaus, which has been approved by the county government meeting, sub-bureaus will be established in Liuhe, Fuqiao, Hengjing, and Zhitang. The directors of each sub-bureau should organize and establish them in accordance with the regulations and report their progress. It was resolved that, for the sake of facilitating work, the Zhitang Rural Cleanup Sub-bureau would be changed to Shaxi Town, and one sub-bureau would be added in the city. The directors of each sub-bureau should organize and establish them in accordance with the organizational regulations within this month and submit a budget for transfer and reporting. (2) Regarding how to divide the areas of the county's rural cleanup sub-bureaus: 1. The City Rural Cleanup Sub-bureau will govern the 1st and 8th districts. 2.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Shanghai Detectives Crack Kidnapping Case in Wujiang: The Shanghai French Concession police, based on informant reports, learned that on the 15th of this month, a four-year-old child surnamed Li from No. 38 Anren Lane, Kangti Road, was kidnapped while being held by his wet nurse in front of the door. The kidnappers were hiding in the countryside belonging to Yan Township in Wujiang County. Therefore, the day before yesterday (the 24th), they sent Chief Detective Ge Lai, along with Jiang Tian, Bao Tan Zhang Pingpu, Yang Shan, and others, to Suzhou to meet with Patrol Officer Shi Hou of the 3rd District of the Water Police, and Hu Hanzhang, a detective from the 15th Team of the Wujiang Water Police, to search for the kidnappers at the destination. However, the bandits had already fled. Only a "meat ticket" (kidnapped child) was found. In a coffin in a nearby tomb, a Mauser pistol, three carbines, and two rifles were found. That night, they were transferred to Shanghai. After being identified by the victim's family, the "ticket" was not the kidnapped child of the Li family. It was also learned that it was definitely another kidnapping case, and five kidnappers had been captured, confessing that the child had been kidnapped from the Gutazhen area within the jurisdiction of the 15th Team of the Wujiang Water Police. Therefore, the French Concession police yesterday (the 25th) dispatched Detective Yang San to Suzhou again to meet with Mao Wenlong, an investigator from the 3rd District of the Shanghai Small Police, to go to the 15th Team of Wujiang to investigate the kidnapped child of the Li family.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Gradually Leaving Suzhou: The No. 17 Rear Hospital in Tiger Hill has been ordered to close. Over eight hundred wounded soldiers have recovered. Yesterday (the 25th), over two hundred were sent to Jingmei Coal Harbor in Beijing to rejoin their units. The rest are scheduled to leave Suzhou this morning (the 26th).</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Public Call from Liuhaisha: Liuhaisha Township, which originally belonged to Nantong County, is surrounded by rivers on all sides. Since the construction of the dam in Duanshan, it has been connected to Shazhou City in this county. During the tenure of Magistrate Wei in the previous year, for the sake of facilitating jurisdiction, it was proposed to merge it. However, it was stopped due to opposition from the residents of the sandbar. Recently, the local gentry in Nantong have been arbitrarily oppressing the residents of the sandbar. At the moment, the majority of the farmers have agreed to automatically break away from Nantong's control. It is said that they are actively proceeding. If this becomes a reality, then Changshu's defense and water conservancy will have a solution and can be free from restraint.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Second Meeting of Families of Victims of Shipwreck Case: The Hengyi ferry, a small vessel of the Taili Steamboat Company in Wuxi, capsized entirely on the 14th of this month, drowning ten passengers. Some days ago, the families of the victims held a meeting at No. 61 Guangfu Road and decided to jointly negotiate seriously with the company. It has been learned that the families of the victims held a second joint meeting regarding the Hengyi ferry disaster at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Wang Longguan, Ms. Zhu, Gu Dechang, Yang Boquan, and Yang Qiaoquan. The following matters were resolved: (1) Regarding the judicial aspect of the case, the families had previously jointly entrusted Lawyer Zhang Shijie to handle it. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the case, it was decided to add Lawyer An Ruotai to handle the case together with Lawyer Zhang. (2) Lawyers Zhang and An have agreed to handle the case pro bono, and it was decided that the families of the victims should express their gratitude to the two lawyers in person in advance. (3) In terms of administrative affairs, the petitions to the Ministry of Transportation, the Provincial Government, the Construction Department, and the County Government Construction Bureau, as well as all drafts of the petitions, were revised and approved on the spot. It was decided to prepare and issue them separately as soon as possible. (4) The Taili Company is currently actively trying to divide the families and seek individual solutions. All families attending the meeting today must maintain close contact and unity, and must not be fooled by them, so as to avoid dispersing their strength. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. At the same time, the families also filed a lawsuit with the County Court, accusing the shipowner Yang Xiangqi and others of the crime of causing death due to negligence in business, as stipulated in Article 291 of the Criminal Law, and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, demanding compensation for the loss of life of the victims and the living expenses of the dependents of the victims.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products Exhibition Opens Today: The entire county's agricultural products exhibition hall, which is jointly organized by the County Agricultural Field, the Cooperative Business Guidance Office of the Education Bureau, and the Wuxi Office of the Agricultural Affairs Investigator of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, has been actively preparing for many days and is scheduled to open today.</p>
<p>Two Suspects Arrested in Zhaimen Robbery Case: The home of Zhu Xingsan, a villager near Zhaimen (Huai Shang City) in the Seventh District, was robbed on the 21st of last month, resulting in huge losses. It is now learned that Zhu Shuiben, the son of Zhu Xingsan, is currently a teacher at Anhui Provincial University. After learning that his family had been robbed, he sent a letter to Director of Civil Affairs Hu, and attached the names of the suspects in the case. After receiving the letter, Director Hu sent the attached letter to County Magistrate Pan, who then forwarded it to Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau, to be investigated. Xu Jun, upon receiving the letter and learning that the suspects named by Zhu Shuiben, someone surnamed He, and He Abing, the son of He Ronggui, were hiding in He Village, South of the Huangmei Jia Mountain, dispatched Miao Wencheng, the deputy captain of the detective team, to lead detectives to investigate and arrest them. After arriving at the destination, He and He Abing had already fled after hearing the news. He Ronggui and his neighbor, He Xiaozu, were captured and escorted to the city to await interrogation. The Amount of Donation Collected for Banquets Is Exceptionally Short: The monthly collection quota for the banquet education donation in this county is two thousand yuan. Including the expenses of the collection office, the monthly total is two thousand five to six hundred yuan. After the collection started on January 1st, the amount collected has been exceptionally short. Only one thousand and several hundred yuan were collected that month. Initially, the restaurant industry in the urban area wanted to contract with the office, with a monthly collection quota of one thousand two hundred yuan, including the collection amount for delivered dishes. At that time, the collection office required that the amount for delivered dishes be collected separately. The two sides disputed and could not reach a decision, so it was changed to actual collection. However, the restaurant industry had other clever methods, so the collection amount could not be met. In order to make up for the shortfall, the collection office recruited contractors from various towns and villages. Due to the uneven wealth of the towns and villages, only seven to eight hundred yuan could be obtained each month, which was still insufficient. The collection regulations were then revised, stipulating that weddings, funerals, and celebrations, even if the food was prepared at home, would also be subject to collection in accordance with the regulations. Unexpectedly, this was opposed by the people, who appealed to the province. Before approval from the provincial government, it was not possible to collect it. Therefore, the amount collected in February was also far short of the target.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Police Team Cracks Bandit Case: Sheng Shangzhi, the captain of the investigation team of the Wujin County Government, previously captured the bandit Wu Heipi (who had kidnapped Wu Lagou, the son of Wu Yang from near Lihe Bridge) in the Second District, and brought him to the county for interrogation. Later, the Bu Yi Bridge Security Team captured Xu Sanliu, an accomplice in the case, and brought him to the county for interrogation. He confessed that there was another accomplice, Zhu Erda, hiding in Dong Henglin. Sheng Shangzhi, the captain of the investigation team, went to arrest him on the 23rd and brought him to the county. After interrogation, the criminals confessed that there were many more accomplices, and that the bandit den was located in Baitu Village in Jiangyin County. On the morning of the 24th, Magistrate Zhang ordered Tang Chongyao, the deputy captain of the police brigade, to lead the captain of the investigation team and more than forty police officers, along with the captured criminal Zhu Erda as an informant, to set off late at night. They arrived at the bandit den in Dong Baitu Village and captured the bandit leader Li Fusheng, bandits Peng Yuhai and Xu Yinfu, the bandit woman Peng Yinshi who was guarding the hostage, and six other bandit women, Peng Panshi, Peng Jinshi, etc. The hostage Wu Lagou was also rescued on the spot. After a brief interrogation, the criminals all confessed without denial and admitted to committing many other kidnapping and robbery cases. After the interrogation, they were brought to the county in the afternoon and ordered to be shackled and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Chang Ce Gen Jumps Off Train and Dies: A police team stationed in Weicun of Wujin County captured a notorious bandit named Chang Ronggen near Anjiashe on the night of the 23rd, along with a pistol. On the 24th, he was escorted to Benniu, taking the train to the city around 2:00 PM. The bandit Chang was tied with hemp rope and held by a police officer. After the train started, the bandit suddenly lunged out of the window. The police officer pulled hard on the hemp rope, but the rope broke, causing the bandit Chang to fall to the ground, his head broken, and he died bleeding. The escorting police officer immediately came to the city to report.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Undercover Investigation Uncovers Large-Scale Opium Case: An Zheng, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, believing that opium prohibition in the eastern townships was too lax and that opium was landing from Xian, specially sent Rao Qilu, a patrol officer from the First Branch, and Huang Jinting, a patrol officer from the Fourth Branch, disguised as peddlers, to Xian to investigate. After confirming the reports were true, he led several armed police officers to Xian by boat, arrested more than a dozen opium dealers and opium lamp users in various opium dens, and brought them and the contraband items to Yangzhou for handling. It was also learned that a large quantity of opium from Japan had arrived in Xian, and local thugs were gathering at the dock to extort money.

We are writing to inquire whether this is true, so as to verify the case. Yesterday, the headquarters thoroughly investigated its subordinates and found no such individuals as Wang, Li, and Zhu.

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Investigation of Zhejiang Province's Paper Industry: Although Zhejiang Province's paper industry has seen some establishment in recent years, it is ultimately difficult to develop in terms of business. Previously, someone named Jin planned to raise funds to establish a large-scale newspaper manufacturing factory, but it was suspended indefinitely due to funding issues. Last year, Jingcheng Company merged the Wulin Paper Mill, increasing its capital. Currently, the capital of the established factories totals more than 800,000 yuan, with more than 900 workers.

<p>Return of Private Property of Meitenggen: The Guangji Hospital in Dafangbo, Hangzhou, was founded by the Westerner Meitenggen, and its property rights also belonged to Meitenggen. Since the Provincial Government took it back in the 16th year of the Republic of China and handed it over to the City Government for safekeeping, it was renamed the Provincial Hospital. Later, the Central Government issued a clear order that the property rights of this house should still be returned to the original owner. The Provincial Government formulated a plan for returning the property and ordered the City Government to implement it separately according to the plan. The Westerner Meitenggen then submitted a request to the province to expedite the return. The City Government was ordered to comply. Yesterday, the City Government examined the case and ordered the Westerner to prepare a document for collection and to execute it according to the case.</p>

<h3>The Death of Zhang Huizan · Wang Gongyu</h3>
<p>The news of the death of Zhang Huizan, the commander of the 18th Division, came suddenly. Those who heard it were shocked. Because there were no detailed records of the fierce battle between Zhang's troops and the Communist army in Donggu Longgang. And the news of him being captured due to exhaustion was also lacking. But the sudden report of his murder and that a sentry discovered his head by the river makes one feel lost and clueless. Therefore, I will describe what I heard below. Zhang was ordered to suppress the Communists this time, and he was extremely serious. He always led the troops into battle. In the Battle of Longgang, he fought fiercely for several days and nights and had broken through the main force of the Communist bandits. But the Communist bandits had a large population and were well-informed. Reinforcements came from all directions. Zhang's troops felt isolated. Their ammunition was also running low. Gradually, the disparity between the two sides became too great, and they were surrounded. Zhang's soldiers were unfortunately captured. At the same time, many of his subordinates were also captured. The Communist bandits initially treated Zhang very well. Hoping that he would surrender. Zhang adhered to the principles of the party. And remained firm for a long time. He refused to betray his principles. So the Communist bandits tried to persuade him repeatedly. But he refused them sternly. And rebuked them loudly. Much like Zhang Suiyang rebuking the bandits. The Communist bandits were angry. So, in a general meeting on the 28th of last month, they decided. To put Zhang to death in the most cruel way. They cut off Zhang's head. And nailed his ears to a plaque with iron nails. The plaque read "Zhang Family Ancestral Hall." Covered with red cloth. With several slogans attached. They let it float on the river. Letting it go wherever it may. It was cruel and also a prank. Completely lacking in human compassion. On the 2nd of this month. A sentry from the 77th Division stationed in Ji first saw it by the river. After his subordinates and relatives identified it as Zhang, the chief of staff of the 18th Division led the entire staff to welcome it into the division headquarters. Lu Dipin, the chairman of Jiangxi Province, was recuperating at the Nanchang Hospital. He wept loudly when he heard the news. He personally went to the division headquarters to pay his respects. Because Zhang's remains only consisted of his head. He hired a craftsman to carve a wooden body. To make a complete corpse. Dressed in the yellow army uniform of an army general. The coffin was made of Phoebe wood.</p>
<p>Worth twelve hundred yuan. Lu also requested a generous pension from the National Government for him. The National Government approved a public funeral. On the 22nd, a telegram from Changsha reported. He Jian also allocated six thousand yuan for Zhang's funeral expenses. In that case, the posthumous</p>
<h3>Record of a Car Blown Over by a Strong Wind · Ji · Jin</h3>
<p>In western Germany. Whenever the seasonal winds change. The mountains and valleys roar. There must be a drastic change in the landscape. According to a Berlin dispatch. In the first ten days of this month. A light railway between Puniburg and Klitz. Carried a train of passenger cars. A total of sixteen cars. Halfway through the journey. With a sudden crash. All of them were blown over. Some passengers were injured. Some were crushed to death. After investigation. Approximately two to three hundred people were affected. When the wind rose. The observatory repeatedly issued warnings. Overseas ships. All dropped anchor. Because they thought that trains were heavy objects. And traveled on land. Which was safe. Unexpectedly, when passing through the Gate Mountains. With the two peaks facing each other. The wind was too strong. It had the force of overturning mountains and overturning seas. The driver accelerated. And ventured forward. Resulting in this disaster. At the same time, countless trees and houses of all sizes on both sides collapsed. It is said that the wind speed was fifty miles per hour. Which had not been seen for decades.</p>
<p>Honors. Are enough to repay Zhang's ambition to die for his country. He has no regrets. According to Zhang's life story. He was extremely loyal to the late President Tan Chaling. When Zhao Hengti was the governor of Hunan Province, he dismissed a garrison commander, which triggered a war. Tan, the late president, was appointed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen as the governor of Hunan Province. And commander-in-chief of the Xiang Army. And led his troops to aid Hunan. At that time, Zhang and Tang Shengzhi, etc. Were all generals of the Xiang Army. They were outwardly under Zhao's command. But secretly sympathetic to Tan. This is how the peace was achieved. Later, Tan was ordered to return his troops to aid Guangdong. Although he was defeated by Zhao, Zhao's ambitions could not be fully realized. It was due to the obstruction of the generals. It is a pity that not all of the generals at that time were like Zhang. This allowed Zhao Hengti to stay in his position.</p>
<h3>News of Zhang Bi Yue's Suicide: Recorded by Zhi Zheng</h3>
<p>Recently, the suicide of Datong female student Zhang Bi Yue has attracted considerable attention from society. Yesterday, I met with a gentleman from Datong University who discussed in great detail the circumstances of Ms. Zhang's life before and after her death. I have selected the main points and recorded them below.</p>
<p>▲Famous Throughout the School: Zhang Bi Yue is, in fact, the person who previously shot her brother-in-law, Huang Chang Dian, in Xuzhou. At that time, Zhang surrendered herself to the court. The officials, considering her youth, did not punish her. However, the matter had already been widely reported in newspapers, and the whole country knew about it. To avoid the attention of her classmates, Zhang changed her name to Zhang Jing Ru upon entering Datong. Soon, busybodies spread the word, and then the whole school knew who she was. Whenever they met her, they would tell each other, "This is the female hero Zhang Bi Yue of Xuzhou."</p>
<p>▲Quiet and Taciturn: Bi Yue was still studying in the third grade of junior high school. She was only sixteen or seventeen years old. Her demeanor was usually quiet and stern, making her unapproachable. Her clothing was also extremely simple. Usually, she wore nothing more than a long blue cloth gown.</p>
<p>▲Precautions After the First Suicide Attempt: This year, after Zhang arrived at the school, she attempted suicide once by taking several bottles of sleeping potion. The attempt was discovered early and she was rescued. However, after that, the school supervisor took stricter precautions against her. All items that could be used for suicide were removed. Even her trouser belt was not allowed. A female servant was specifically assigned to attend to her. Who knew that an inconspicuous small penknife would lead her to an irredeemable end?</p>
<p>▲The Tragic Scene During the Autopsy: When Zhang committed suicide, there were a total of five knife wounds. The first cut severed her throat. The second pierced her temple. The rest were on her forehead. The intensity of her character is evident. During the autopsy, her face was covered in blood. Even the laborers who went in first could not bear to look at it. The school prepared a coffin for her burial. Her sister, Bi Chi, took the coffin back for burial.</p>
<p>▲Frightening Three Misses: There were three other misses in the same room with Ms. Zhang. After the incident, the three of them were extremely panicked. Because Zhang's suicide took place in the room and was extremely gruesome, the impression on their minds was profound. They were terrified whenever they recalled it at night.</p>
<p>▲The Truth Remains Unclear: Why did Ms. Zhang commit suicide? The reason remains unclear to this day. No suicide note was found, and before her death, she burned all kinds of letters. Therefore, the real reason is still a matter of speculation.</p>
<h3>Ancient Tombs in the Suburbs of Beiping Plundered: Written by Shi Yan Ye</h3>
<p>The trend of tomb raiding originated in the imperial mausoleums of Guandong. Unexpectedly, in recent years, it has flourished in the four suburbs of Beiping. Instances of ancient tombs being brutally plundered by bandits are often heard. However, the voices of those underground are only heard at the time and not by later generations. Therefore, the destruction of their tombs attracts little attention. Recently, the tombs of Yang Jisheng, Liu Jin, and others were reported to have been robbed, causing those who heard about it to be shocked and to spread the news.</p>
<p>Changxindian in the suburbs of Beiping has a gully that winds for several miles, with dense forests and beautiful scenery. There are seventy-two large tombs, commonly known as the "Seventy Imperial Belt Tombs." The Ming Dynasty eunuch Yang Jisheng and Liu Jin also rest here. The others are all tombs of prominent figures from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. There must be many precious burial objects. Moreover, there are as many as seventy-two beautiful burial grounds. It is fitting that they have been coveted by bandits. Since the beginning of the year, each tomb has been tragically excavated. Wooden coffins were chopped up, and white bones lay scattered. All the precious burial goods were taken away. Those who passed by could not help but sigh at the tragic fate of those in the tombs. In the desolation, only the tombs of Yang and Liu are recognized. Most people do not know who is buried in the other tombs. The reason for this is that the descendants of the prominent figures have declined or live far away. On the one hand, no one cares about them anymore, and on the other hand, the distance is too great to hear about it. The bandits number about a hundred, with local ruffians mixed in. They are all armed and run rampant in the suburbs of Beiping. The number of tombs of princes, dukes, and other dignitaries that have been robbed is even greater. The losses must be over a million. It is said that a large number of jade objects were obtained from the tomb of a certain prince, and they were all sold to an Englishman for 100,000 gold.</p>
<p>In Wuqing County, there is a tomb of a Qing Dynasty Jinshi named Wang. During his lifetime, Wang was prominent and held important positions in Shanxi Province. On the day of his death, his tomb was built on over a hundred mu of land, a large tomb. Recently, it was also robbed by thieves. However, when they destroyed the tomb and smashed the coffin, they searched everywhere but found nothing. Although the Jinshi held important positions, he was honest and self-disciplined, taking nothing. In life, he had clean sleeves, and after death, only the bright moon in the mountains accompanied him. In grief and anger, the bandits smashed the coffin into powder and turned his bones into ashes, a cruelty beyond description. He was honest in life, but after death, he was robbed for this reason. This was something the Jinshi could not have foreseen.</p>
<p>In addition, if the tomb of a modern person or a commoner contains any valuable burial objects, the thieves will try every means to find it, break into the tomb, and take it away. A man named Gong in the county buried his mother for only ten days before her tomb was destroyed by bandits. The burial goods were worth several hundred gold. They were taken away, and the corpse was also subjected to the horror of having its bones crushed and its body shattered. Alas! Can the bandits' flesh be eaten to satisfy their hunger?</p>
<h3>Zhang Jun Guang, A Revolutionary Youth: Written by Chi Zhu</h3>
<p>Revolutionary party members are often romantic, dashing, and uninhibited individuals. Zhang Jun Guang of Nanhui is one of them. Mr. Zhang is young, handsome, and has the demeanor of Lord Mengchang. Early on, he lamented the decline of the country and deeply understood the need for revolution. He dedicated himself to the country. After graduating from military academy, he engaged in practical work in Shanghai, experiencing hardships but never fearing them. After a failed attempt, he was arrested and imprisoned for several months, but he remained cheerful. After being rescued by friends, his spirit became even stronger. In the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic, he served as the general commander in Shanghai, leading thousands of plainclothes brave men in secret operations, achieving considerable success. Mr. Zhang made a significant contribution to the Party army's recapture of Shanghai. After Jiangnan was secured, he led his brave men to fight in Jiangbei. After the unification of the North and South, he disbanded his forces and came to Shanghai to engage in writing. Because Mr. Zhang has a special fondness for literature, he associates with scholars such as Tian Ziqin and He Shimai, discussing academics and gaining considerable insights. Recently, there have been rumors that he is moving towards the political stage, which is not accurate. Mr. Zhang is currently writing a philosophical book of tens of thousands of words, which will soon be published. He has no intention of political life.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is chivalrous and righteous. Because he is engaged in secret work, he has made many connections in the underworld. People in the Party organizations in the North and South of the Yangtze River all know about Zhang Jun Guang. Mr. Zhang was admired by the elder Zhang Shusheng. Mr. Zhang's name has shaken the North and South for decades, and he is known in the underworld as the "Heavenly King Laozi." Mr. Zhang Jun Guang is also respected by the underworld because of this. When Sun Chuanfang was entrenched in Jiangbei, bandits rose up everywhere. When the Party army first arrived in Jiangbei, it was not easy to suppress them all at once. One unit of Zhou Fengqi's Twenty-sixth Army was disarmed, showing how rampant they were. At that time, Zhang also led a team through this area and was very cautious. On the way, they heard gunfire and suspected that the enemy had arrived. He ordered them to deploy defenses. Who knew that those who came were not enemies but local bandits who came to welcome them? Mr. Zhang was afraid of trickery and ordered them to abandon their weapons and send representatives to speak. They said that they had long admired his reputation and had come to greet and escort him and were willing to be his vanguard. At that time, it was a beautiful story in the army. This was thanks to the influence of Heavenly King Laozi.</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "Record of the Destruction of Ancient Relics in Xiashi" published the other day, all the characters "Xiá 硤" were mistakenly printed as "fū 砆." Also, the number of the "Travel Notes of Nanyang" was "124" and was mistakenly written as "214." This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (374): Written by Bao Tian Xiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Skilled in Preserving Youthful Looks, Cui Dai Confounded Eyebrows; No Way to Prolong Life, Gold Market骏骨</p>
<p>It turned out that Ye Tong Hou was from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. He is currently a compradore at the Heping 洋行 (foreign firm) in Shanghai. The name of that 洋行 is called Heping (Peace). However, their business is not very peaceful. It is a company that specializes in military uniforms. Ye Tong Hou became the military uniform compradore in that line. In fact, he is also a scholar from a family of scholars. His father was a famous educator of the time. His father urged him to study, but he was always truant. His father rebuked him. He said that the pursuit of knowledge is everywhere now. Why bother toiling away at books and becoming a big bookworm? It so happened that his father was an old gentleman who never put down his books. He was speechless by his son and had to let him be free. Whether he went to school or not. At that time, during the late Qing Dynasty, the imperial examination had not yet been abolished. Suddenly, he entered a school and passed the examination to become a Xiucai (scholar). Even his father didn't know. Someone came to congratulate Mr. Ye. Mr. Ye was stunned and asked where the joy came from. The congratulator said that his son had passed the examination. Mr. Ye didn't believe it and said how could he pass the examination? He was out fooling around all day long. Later, he asked and found out that he had indeed passed the examination. Looking at his writing, it was not only smooth but also had some insightful remarks. Mr. Ye said with his mouth, "Absurd, nonsense, it's just luck." His words seemed to have regret, but he was actually a little happy. However, Ye Tong Hou could not be restrained by his father. He came to Shanghai. Sometimes he went to school, and sometimes he came out again. He couldn't stand the restraint of each school for more than three months. He came out immediately and changed to another school. After a few months, he felt tired of school life and had to change to a new atmosphere. Suddenly, he engaged in literary life and wrote a novel. He called himself a "浪荡男儿" (dissolute son) and described a group of self-proclaimed revolutionaries in Shanghai's new academic circles. He described them vividly. In short, this Ye Tong Hou is an extremely intelligent person. He can succeed in whatever he does. Unfortunately, he is knowledgeable but not specialized. In the first and second years of the Republic of China, he knew several figures in the military and political circles in Shanghai. At that time, Chinese people had to consult with foreign 洋行 for the purchase of munitions. The 洋行 that made military uniforms hoped that China would have internal strife. When China had internal strife, their business would come. At this time, the European War had not yet occurred. Many scientists were inventing all kinds of killing machines. They can be regarded as changing with each passing day. The killing machines invented this year will not be needed next year. By next year, this year's will feel outdated again. After a long time, where will those old machines be disposed of? If they are disposed of in various countries, the European countries also have their own new inventions. Why would they want your old things? As soon as they hear that there is internal strife in China, all the 19th-century machines that they have abandoned are sent to the Chinese market.</p>

<p>▲Spot Exports Envelop the Market</p>
<p>▲Strong Rise of Eleven Taels and More: Yesterday, February 25th, the price of gold rose even more strongly, mainly because spot exports were very lively, which raised people's spirits. However, the changes were still intense, with a drop of five or six taels in an instant. The difference between the opening and closing prices was almost twenty taels. In the end, it surged eleven taels and some change. The demand among colleagues varied. Companies such as Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuantai, and the Dalian gang all purchased. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Dade, and others mostly sold. The exchange rate has shrunk by half a level, and the internal interest rate is also showing. As for the overseas silver market, it reported a slight contraction, so the price of gold opened high. Later, the situation was chaotic and unpredictable. At noon, news spread in the market that a certain bank was buying spot goods, and there were rumors that a large amount would be transported for export on the 27th of this month, which was enough to arouse people's spirits.

The United States had something to sell, and then there was a complex mix with fluctuations of five taels, from 60 taels back to 55 taels. It was really that the incoming and outgoing of various companies differed. Until after 9:20, it seemed that there were more buyers, and then it stabilized. It was counted as 59 shillings, and the announcement was not changed, so it dropped again to 56.5 taels. Internally, it was flat. Mitsui bought March US dollars at 29.6875 yuan, and Ande bought May British gold at 1.2625 yuan. Soon, it rose to 59 taels, and because British gold seemed loose, April could settle at 1.2625, and because Yuanmao, Bingqian, Changxiang, and speculators tended to sell, it fell by as much as seven taels. At around 9:50, it suddenly became 52 taels. Soon, Taichang, Fuchang, Hengxing, Yuan, and others rushed in, and HSBC and Zhejiang, etc., ate up April British gold at 1.25625, so the market situation was boosted, and it suddenly soared by more than nine taels. At 10:15, it was 61.5 taels. Then, because Yuancheng and others sold, and British gold could settle at 1.25625 to .625, it dropped by 4 taels, to 57 taels after 10:30. Afterwards, it was rumored that a certain bank had bought 210 spot contracts, and then there was news of more than 400 contracts, so people's spirits were greatly boosted, and it suddenly rose to 58 or 59 taels. Soon, Dade, Chengyuan, Hengxingyuan, and others had sold and entered. British gold became even more popular, and the bank ate up 1.25 to .4375. At 11:30, HSBC's listing shrunk by half a level. British gold was counted at 1.25, US dollars at 25, and Japanese gold was increased by 1.25. Gold was especially popular because of this, and it continued to rise by eight or nine taels.

It continued to do business at 56 taels, which was the selling of set heads and other accounts. The market price was initially counted at 811 taels and 8 qian (0.8 taels), pressing down small amounts from 54 or 55 taels to 60 taels, and then changed to 817 taels and 8 qian, suppressing 50 taels.</p>
<p>▲The Post-Market Situation is Superior: The post-market opened at 61 taels, followed by 6 taels, 34 taels and a half, and the market situation was flat. Soon, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Chang, Hengxingyuan, and Jinchang bought, and it suddenly jumped up five taels, to 69.5 taels at 2:45. However, the Indian exchange telegrams were quite confusing.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Tight, Both Openly and Secretly</h3>
<p>▲The Difference Between Shillings and Gold Is 40 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets both reported a slight decline, but the market conditions were uncertain. Both British and American exchange rates have risen. HSBC's listings were initially unchanged, but at 11:30, they suddenly shrunk by half a level. British gold was counted at 1.25, which is 1 shilling, 2 pence and 375.

The closing price of each exchange at noon compared to the previous night, British gold shrank by 0.25, US dollars by 0.5 yuan, and Japanese gold rose by 2.25.

Only Mitsui ate more than 100,000 yuan of US dollars, and there were few transactions in Japanese gold. There was no one to ask about the set head, because the incoming and outgoing prices were too far apart, and the calculation was not possible.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Debt Market Before Delivery</h3>
<p>▲The February Term Has Stopped Trading to Prepare for Delivery</p>
<p>▲The April Term Will Open Today, and the Market Was Extremely Weak Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Securities Exchange had already stopped trading because the February futures had to be prepared for delivery, and the April goods had to open on the market starting today, so yesterday only the three-day-period market was available. Because of the approaching delivery, the market was desolate, and only sporadic entries and exits were available in each place. The futures transaction totaled 1.2 million yuan, of which 20-year volume and 19-customs were each counted as 200,000 or 300,000, and most of the others were less than 100,000 yuan. The spot goods only had troops reduced, and the whole six kinds totaled 15,400 yuan, and there was no other transaction. The trend of each debt was generally rising due to the good demand, and it was better than the previous day with the starting number of corners, but the spot price of the whole six troops was reduced.</p>
<p>Debt Category, Term Current, Previous Opening, Previous Closing, Compared to the Previous Day, Transaction Number</p>
<p>Whole Six, Current, 68.10, ......, Fell 0.05, 7,400</p>

<h3>Discovery of Extraordinary Surge in Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Distant Futures Exceed 80 Taels</p>
<p>▲ Two Major Reasons: Flower Prices Triggered Large-Scale Purchases</p>
<p>The ferocity of the surge in the yarn market is truly rare. This situation is quite alarming. However, the rising momentum of raw cotton has led to a corresponding rise in yarn prices. Moreover, a certain industrialist has ambitious plans, anticipating 190 taels in distant months. Therefore, they are absorbing a substantial amount in the futures market. Generally, stable players are taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, most Japanese traders seem to be short sellers, but their cotton purchases can still offset the direct costs. Because actual demand is sluggish, individual small traders are still shorting. The current rise in yarn prices is entirely due to the surge in flower prices and purchases by large, powerful traders. The future still holds significant changes. According to some, the bullish side is organized and coordinated, making it difficult to defeat them unless a particularly major flaw is discovered.</p>
<p>▲ Human Label Jumps Six Taels</p>
<p>The human label market opened with strong sentiment due to firm Japanese demand, rising American cotton, and favorable gold market news. Furthermore, a certain manufacturer continued to increase purchases, intensifying the upward trend. Each rose by 2.1 to 3.7 or 4.2 taels. The afternoon was the last day for local traders. Although deliveries were sufficient, there were even more buyers. There must be inherent reasons for this. Small traders covered their positions, which led to a surge of 4.4 taels. Distant months were driven by this, with each rising by 1.4 to 2.5 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 32,400 bales. Buy orders: Gengfeng 2,250 bales, Yishenchang 1,550 bales, Yichang 1,150 bales, Changfeng 1,500 bales, Xincheng 1,350 bales. Sell orders: Hengyi 1,000 bales, Tianlong 850 bales, Ruida 850 bales, Shengtai 1,350 bales, Mingde 1,450 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Open Interest: May 180.1, up 5.3, 32,800; June 180.7, up 6.1, 30,200; July 180.5, up 5.7, 10,400; March 174, up 5.6, 55,450; April 179.4, up 5.6, 59,500.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Transactions Still Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Brokers' interest is still weak. The total daily purchase volume by various brokers was 850 bales. Intermediaries took in 600 bales. Prices rose by 3.5 taels. Among the client brokers, Hankou took in 155 bales, inland areas 160 bales, Guangdong 130 bales, Nanyang 75 bales, Sichuan 50 bales, Shantou 80 bales, Yunnan 145 bales, and [blank] brokers 50 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>▲ Surface Dry... Buying Voices Soar</p>
<p>The cotton market has experienced another sharp rise, becoming extremely tight. The trend seems to be escalating. Only buying voices are heard in the market, and sellers have disappeared. Japanese merchants...a large number of bulls... currently feel dryness. What will the future bring? It is difficult to imagine. Hankou merchants see the unfavorable situation and are all hesitant. Most are settling because Indian cotton prices are high, and there are positive news for American cotton. Therefore, those who are bullish are showing great joy. It is difficult to sell unless foreign cotton loosens.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Label Surges by Two Taels and More</p>
<p>The Hankou label market opened with a unified rise in American and Indian cotton, making sentiment even tighter. Each month jumped by more than one tael. The second and third rounds remained firm. As a result, each rose by 1.225 to 1.55 taels. The afternoon market remained high, and each month rose again by 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8 taels. The total daily transaction volume was 51,100 dan.

<p>▲ Spot Cotton Prices High, Demand Weak</p>
<p>Although demand for spot cotton has decreased, the rising momentum is fierce. Factories' attitudes are relatively sluggish. The source is estimated to be 700 bales of Yao flower, it is said.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 47.00. Sulun Factory took in 100 pieces for spot delivery at the warehouse.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Rise by 30 Points</h3>
<p>▲ Strong Buying Power for American Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were firm and active initially due to purchases by peers. Later, due to strong support from Wall Street and favorable news from Liverpool, prices rose even more firmly. Futures rose by 23 to 29 points, and spot prices rose by 30 points. English cotton futures rose by 5 to 6 points, and spot prices fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton market conditions were stable.

<h3>Food Grain: Rice Market in a Downward Spiral</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, only ten or so brokers arrived at the source. Sales were meager because the shops still had thick inventories. Prices fell again. Northern White Rice was in an irreversible downward spiral. The asking price for the "small-corner" variety was specially opened at around 13.5 yuan. There was no hope of improvement. Thin rice was scarce in arrivals, and sales were mediocre. The market for soft-corner Zuoyang Xian and Duxian was not lively. Merchants and customers wanted to wait and see. However, due to the general trend, it was inevitable to follow the small-corner rice, changing to a negative phase downstream. Market prices remained sluggish by about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Yesterday, about 20 ships arrived from inland areas. Outbound routes were flat. Chang-style white rice was slightly discounted, but sales were sluggish, so it was very weak.</p>
<p>Suzhou and Tong's retail sales were not smooth, and sales were stagnant. For the "small-corner" variety, the source of Southern-style thin early rice was abundant, and customer interest was extremely weak, continuing to soften. Yang Dujian turned from stable to falling. Outbound routes were strangely sluggish, and the transition was not good. Merchants were eager to sell quickly, so prices were again short by one or two jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Recovers with Gold Prices in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for all months still showed a sluggish trend.</p>
<p>Because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell slightly again, outside traders could not help but take a wait-and-see attitude. Several major factories, because they still had a lot of foreign wheat on order, still took advantage of the situation to sell. Therefore, although the lowest prices in distant months were slightly lower than the previous day by about one point, near-term prices were very stable due to the selling price of spot flour, such as Bingshun at 2.275 taels with a discount, and Shuangma opening at 2.2875 taels with a discount. Until the market opened in the afternoon, it was still flat at first. Then, with the rebound in gold prices, the sentiment of outside traders was boosted, and the prices rebounded by more than one point compared with the lowest prices in the morning. After observing the subsequent steps, it is still looking at the lengthening or shortening of foreign exchange rates. As a result, this month rose by 7.5 li compared with the previous day, March rose by 1.25 points, April rose by 5 li, and May rose by 2.5 li. June and July were unchanged, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Weaken and Then Strengthen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market initially showed a continuation of the weakening trend. In the morning, each market was quiet in foreign wheat quotations, with only two or three points lower than the closing price of the previous day. Until the afternoon market, with the price of gold rising again, the foreign exchange rate was shrinking, and the buying of outside traders became active again. The closing price was three or four points higher than the closing price in the morning. Observing the future trends, although foreign countries are shrinking, the fact is still the basis for the near and far future. As a result, this month was [illegible] points higher than the previous day, April was two points higher, May was three points higher, and June and July were two points higher. Spot transactions were quiet and there were no quotes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Turns Firm</h3>
<p>The soybean market opened mediocre yesterday. Later, due to the telegram from Dalian reporting firmness, and the upward trend of the standard gold, sentiment improved. Empty positions were covered, and few customers were slightly buying. Therefore, each month in the afternoon was three or four points higher. Currently, spot sales are still active. Although there is [illegible] influence, the actual control is in the hands of Japanese traders. The changes in the Dalian market are most important. As a result, February and May were four points higher, March was three points higher, and April was two points higher.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated and White Sugar Rise by One Qian</h3>
<p>▲ First Opening of 10,000 Bags of Japanese Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market telex from producing areas stated that the current price of Cuban sugar had not changed. New York sugar futures for March and May were two points higher than the previous session, and other months were unchanged. Spot sugar in Java also remained unchanged. The union opened its market with the No. 20 Sand White Sugar on the exchange, but the buying was slightly active due to the rising foreign exchange rate. The transaction price was 10.09 taels. There was a special shortage. The price was re-shouted to 11 taels. The market was slightly flat. No. 20 Medium Sand White was 10.04 taels, and No. 5 Red was 9.06 taels. Transactions were also sluggish. Japanese TK sugar was 11.15 taels, YT sugar was 11.05 taels, and TRO sugar was 10.075 taels. There were slight transactions. All other labels were still silent, and the trend was stable. The factory opened a market for 10,000 bags of YT sugar at the Zhizhi Pond. The price of Japanese gold was 4.4 yuan for RO sugar and 4 yuan for YT sugar. The banks showed intention, but sales were difficult to complete. The situation was quite sluggish. On the board, yesterday Nansheng [blank] offered 1,000 bags of No. 5 Red [blank], priced at 9.06 [blank]. Also, 1,000 [blank] of No. 10 were priced at 9.08 qian. [blank] opened 2,699 bags of No. 18 Sand White, priced at 10.03 qian. Tong Diaoqing opened 71 bags, priced at 8.09 qian. Xiamen Bing opened 135 bags, priced at 14.04 qian. Market conditions were generally stable and not unusual.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Scallops are Scarce and Hoarded</h3>
<p>Last year, the output of scallops in various places was not lubricated. The harvest was less than 50-60% of previous years, resulting in few sources and low street inventory. Once guest sales are activated, the market shows insufficient supply. Until recently, the inventory of various [blank] was even more lacking, so whether it is a bank or a shop, whoever has inventory will hoard it, so the market has created an unprecedentedly high price. Yesterday, the market quoted medium-sized Xiangguan goods at 240 taels, large-sized at 228 taels, triangle shells, Xinguang short knives at 182 taels, old colors at 175 taels, broken grains at 215 taels, second-grade at 180 taels, Aomori at 160 taels to 155 taels. Yantai goods at 152 taels to 140 taels. Although the business of guest banks is less active, the footing is solid, and the market is quite firm.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Seed Prices Tighten</h3>
<p>According to the telegram from Hankou yesterday, Hunan lotus seeds are showing a tight trend. The bottom line of inventory in the area is less than 1,000 pieces, of which ordinary goods account for 60%, and high-quality goods are even scarcer. Hengzhou Yun's asking price is 27 taels (per dan), Chong Jiuqi [blank] is 25 taels, and Changlian was 23.04 qian in the previous market. The current market is about 24 taels, and it is expected to be completed in the day. However, sales in Shanghai are considered to be very ordinary. ▲ Both black melon seeds and the previous two days have been opened, including Dangshan seeds and Zhangshu seeds at 12 taels, Xu Kui seeds at 11.5 taels, and Zhongmu seeds at 9.45 qian. ▲ The inventory of Bozhou red dates in the Hankou market is relatively high, requiring 7.02 to 0.04 qian, making it difficult to calculate in Shanghai. Ordinary goods here opened at 7.02 qian yesterday and still felt popular.</p>
<h3>Pickled Vegetables Fall Back, Dried Longan Turns Tight</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber was previously opened at 30 yuan. Recently, the market for various banks has been very deserted, and the trend has softened again. Yesterday, I heard that a batch of ordinary goods was opened at a price of 28 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than before. The market quoted high-quality goods at 30 yuan and ordinary goods at 27-28 yuan. Guest banks are still waiting and watching for large-scale transactions. The mainland of the street has slightly sporadic purchases to embellish the market. ▲ Because there are not many sources of Hainan dried longan and the bottom line of inventory is not very sufficient, and Taiwan goods are difficult to be combined due to the exchange [blank], the market is extremely firm. It was opened at 34 taels a few days ago, but the broker was unwilling to redeem more.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: French Silk Sales Stagnate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of silk in foreign firms in this port became more lifeless. Due to the heavy snow and severe cold in Marseille and other places in France, silk sales were greatly sluggish. Silk factories had more sufficient raw material inventories, and the intake of raw silk was stagnant. The actual sales of Chinese silk in Shanghai were stagnant, and the market was increasingly sluggish. Yesterday, only Weicheng entered Shanghai White Factory Sutures for ten packages, and Hexing entered Yellow Reels Sutures for five packages.

<h3>Japanese Touzhuang Moves to Handle Gongxi Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in foreign firms in this port saw a few random intakes of Zhenmei green tea from the Lai Road Zhuang, Ying E [English-Russian] Zhuang, and items such as Needle Eyebrow Pearl Tea. The French Zhuang also had a slight demand. The market was generally unchanged. However, Gongxi green tea, since the Russian Zhuang announced its suspension, trade has been stagnant for a long time. In recent days, the firms such as Japanese Touzhuang, Qianyi, and Fubei have learned that the tea sales in the Mumbai market have been activated, and they have all moved to handle the tea at the right time. Yesterday, more than 600 boxes were traded in the market. The selling price was 26-27 taels, which was 2-3 taels lower than the previous drop.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices of Various Goods Slightly Fall Back</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been quite quiet recently due to high opening prices. In addition, there are still many hand-held goods among the peers, resulting in unevenness. However, the gold market rose again yesterday, and people's minds were still able to stand firm. The needs of this street are still stagnant. Among the guest banks, the outgoing of Tianjin Bank is slightly quiet, the intake interest of Qingdao Bank is turning strong, and Sichuan Bank slightly opened its hand yesterday and traded more than 100 pieces of fine wool, Zhigong neili, and dyed cloth. The price of goods was slightly lower than a few days ago. Zhigong neili was slightly lower by five cents, Hunting Goose was sold for 4 qian 1 fen, Moganshan was 4 qian 0.075 li, and Shuangyilu was 3 qian 6.5 fen. Fine wool and other underbody goods were softer and fell by about 1 fen. Sanyou Tu was 3 qian 5.5 fen, Huanle was 3 qian 6.25 li, Huxinche was 3 qian 6.75 li, and Gong [blank] Tu was 3 qian 5 fen. Gray Guang Xie was 2 qian [blank]. Yesterday, 5 taels and 8 qian were willing to sell. Yesterday, Piaobu, Fushou Sanxing was 11 taels 7.5 qian, and Guo Ziyi was 12 taels 7.5 qian, also slightly smaller. However, Western goods continued to rise. The Yin Danshilin, Zhubu, and fine cloth of Fair continued to rise by 3-4 qian, and the Fangli Zhigong Neili was sold for 3 qian 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Zhigong Neili Spring Disk Firmly Rises</h3>
<p>The Yu Qing Zhigong Neili spring disk opened, and both the bright and dark ones were very strong. The fabrics are in tight demand for Chinese and Western clothing. The old goods stored in Shanghai have long been out of stock. The new goods arriving this spring are limited. In addition, due to the relationship between tariffs and Shillings, the cost has increased. The peers are very thoughtful. Now, the worst single-sided goods must be sold for 3 taels 6-7 qian per wholesale code, and the top-body goods are sold for about 8 taels. The ordinary goods previously sold for 3 taels have now risen to around 5 taels.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Overseas Chinese Investment in Reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>▲ The company has already submitted a factual report to the National Government yesterday</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's report to the National Government reads: "Regarding the matter of reporting, we received a document from the Ministry of Communications, which stated that the Executive Yuan Secretariat issued a letter stating that Chiang, the concurrently serving President, forwarded a letter from Lu Yinmin of the Xinghua Bank Company, which was entrusted to the National Government. Overseas Chinese merchant Xu Qingwen and Ningbo merchant Yan Songtao are intent on advancing a loan of 20 million yuan to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and requested that this matter be submitted for review and approval. We were instructed to forward it to the Ministry of Communications, etc. Therefore, we respectfully enclosed the original documents and forwarded them for your reference, and attached copies of the original letter and two resumes. As the matter concerns the company's reorganization plan and whether it is feasible, we have urgently copied and forwarded the original documents, requesting a detailed review and response, etc." After investigating Lu Yinmin and Xu Qingwen, etc., they claimed that they could borrow and advance 20 million yuan for the company's reorganization expenses. Since the time of the former General Manager Zhao, we have repeatedly been in contact with them, but all discussions ceased due to insufficient capital. Since I took office, Xu Qingwen and Lu Dianyuan have repeatedly come to discuss the matter. Initially, I thought that if it was an investment by overseas Chinese to develop shipping, I would gladly accept it. Therefore, I personally contacted them and conducted a thorough investigation. However, as soon as I inquired about the capital, they were evasive and lacked evidence. They only demanded various conditions, such as commissions and rebates, to manage the business. It turned out that Xu Qingwen was just an ordinary comprador of a foreign firm and not a truly wealthy overseas Chinese merchant. Lu was only engaged in intermediary introductions and did not seem to have the ability to invest a large amount of capital. Therefore, I did not engage with them much. They then submitted a report to your office. Upon closer examination of their claims, they were all inaccurate. Recently, they have repeatedly publicized in newspapers, exaggerating at will, and even falsely borrowing the Chairman's name to confuse the public. I have respectfully submitted their promotional materials for your perusal, so that you may fully understand the situation. The aforementioned Lu Yinmin and Xu Qingwen's so-called insider information on advancing funds should be truthfully reported. We respectfully request your review and approval. Respectfully submitted to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government."</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Ministry of Industry to Encourage Savings to Create Capital</h3>
<p>▲ Can reduce labor disputes</p>
<p>The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to various trade associations, those receiving directly also included. It reads: [Official Seal] "Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau Instruction No. 686 [Official Seal]. Regarding [Official Seal] Ministry of Industry Instruction Business No. 1157 [Official Seal], after reviewing the files of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, within the files of the Industrial and Commercial Conference, the case of "Encouraging Savings to Create Capital" by Mou Junde, Director of the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau, was approved through a conference resolution. After investigation, capital is an essential factor in production. If citizens can diligently cultivate the virtue of saving and transform it into useful pre-production relations, it is extremely important. As for item four of the original proposal, "Partners investing shares," it can resolve labor-management disputes and improve the status of partners, which is the urgent task of today. In addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby issue the original proposal, instructing the bureau to forward it to the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce to actively encourage it, to benefit the people's livelihood, etc." Attached is the original proposal. Respectfully, [Official Seal], This hereby issues, instructing the association to comply and implement this order, etc. And attached, the original resolution is issued to the association, by this, we forwarded the original resolution and issue a formal notification, requesting that all members comply and implement accordingly, etc. The excerpts of the proposal are as follows: Regarding the case of encouraging savings to create capital, to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, capital must first be created. To create capital, savings must first be encouraged. To encourage savings, diligence and thrift are valued. Diligence increases production, and thrift reduces consumption. Increased production and reduced consumption leave surplus wealth for capital use. China has a vast land and a dense population. Two of the major important elements of the economy are wealth, but because the people do not know how to use it, capital cannot be created, causing people to not have the ability to apply their labor, and most are transformed into the destitute, and the land cannot be fully utilized, and most is transformed into barren hills. It is not that heaven's favor is not excellent, but that human affairs have not been exhausted. Looking at the lives of the people, clothing, food, and housing are very simple. The poor may have no room for savings, but there is a most uneconomical phenomenon in the lives of the people, which can be summarized in one word: "The purpose is not appropriate." Those who are not appropriate in their purpose mostly like to pursue vain reputations and do not seek practical use. For example, clothing is not valued for durability but for beauty, food is not valued for health but for sweetness and fatness, and weddings and funerals compete for extravagance. Stably drinking and holding funerals can cost more than ten thousand gold. These useful assets are consumed in useless socializing, and there is also the item of opium, which has consumed no less than one million yuan in the past fifty years. If it can be saved and used to enrich the mother of industry, the number of banks and factories would increase beyond imagination. Now that the harm of opium has not been eliminated, the consumption of cigarettes is increasing daily, and vendors and porters all smoke for pleasure. It can be seen that there is still room for savings in the lives of the poor, and even more so in cities. However, the reason why national consumption cannot implement savings is that, first, the habit of saving has not been cultivated, and second, the savings institutions are not complete. In the past thirty years, countless banks and companies have gone bankrupt, and even savings bonds have been used as weapons for fraud. The people's hard-earned savings are emptied by these people. As a result, savers are disappointed, and spenders increase daily. Therefore, to encourage savings and create capital in the future, on the one hand, we must guide the people to diligently practice thrift, and on the other hand, we must supervise the savings institutions to complete their proper facilities. The former involves the scope of civil administration and education, while the latter belongs to the responsibility of industrial and commercial administration. The main points are listed below: (1) Supervise savings institutions to ensure the safety of deposits. Safety is the first priority for savings bank deposits. Whether the use of savings deposits is truly stable and reliable, not only should the official government have a complete assessment, but society should also have public supervision. There are three important procedures: (1) The use of savings deposits should be limited to reliable securities and real estate mortgages. (2) Commercial banks that also operate savings should separate the boundaries to make the savings accounting independent. If the savings funds of the same bank are transferred to the commercial counter, it should also be handled according to the previous procedure. (3) The accounts should be settled every six months, and the types and amounts of deposits and the quantity and price of pledged items should be displayed to the public, and inspected by the supervisory office and the trade association. The postal savings operated by the government should also be handled in the same way as savings banks. (2) Prohibit savings bonds.奸商 use the beautiful name of bonds to carry out speculative activities, which is the worst of hurting customs and morals. Strict prohibition is necessary. Life insurance companies are also a way to save bonds. Recently, this type of business often disregards credit. The so-called preferential conditions are mostly nominal and not real, or they compete with customers and give preferential deductions, only enriching the private pockets of a few people, which should be strictly suppressed to protect the interests of the insured. (3) Stores and factories should implement compulsory savings. Recently, the standard of living has increased daily, and urban residents are particularly fond of comparing with each other. Those who rely on labor and salaries to make a living often do not know how to be frugal, resulting in deficits, fraud, embezzlement, and escape, which are common. Stores and factories are the worst. For the sake of social security, compulsory savings should be implemented as soon as possible. For all store clerks and workers, at least 40% of the year-end bonus should be saved, and at least 20% of the annual salary increase should be saved. They should be allowed to deposit in the store or factory, and interest should be paid according to the deposit. If it is inconvenient to deposit in the store or factory, the owners and partners can jointly decide on a savings institution, but it must be used for weddings, funerals, education, medicine, or retirement before it can be withdrawn. (4) Promote partners to invest shares. The relationship between capital and labor in industry is like the left and right hands of the human body. They only differ in position and direction, but they often forget their common interests. Therefore, the first essential for labor-management coordination is to combine labor and capital into one. Not only are the interests of the partners equal, but the status of mankind is becoming increasingly equal, gradually achieving the goal of equal property. Everyone has permanent property, then the rocking, infighting, and jealousy will be reduced. However, this must start with diligence and thrift. If the partners and workers do not know how to save, then development will be difficult, and there will be no surplus. The income will still be distributed to the partners to increase their status. This is the only key to mankind's upward progress. Whether the above is appropriate, I respectfully propose it for review and deliberation.</p>
<h3>Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Requests Reduction of Railway Freight Rates</h3>
<p>▲ To be proposed at the Commercial Transportation Conference</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways will convene a National Commercial Transportation Conference on March 1st. Various industries in this city related to transportation have all appointed representatives to attend at that time. The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, bearing the responsibility of safeguarding commerce, and being aware of the difficulties faced by merchants and the people in recent years, intends to plead for the merchants and the people again at this Commercial Transportation Conference to reduce the freight rates for domestic goods, in order to seek the prosperity of commerce. The association has now drafted a proposal and sent it to the ministry for compilation into the agenda. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"It is believed that in addition to facilitating public transportation, state-owned railways also bear the task of fostering agriculture, commerce, and developing industries. In our country, where industry is still young and shipping rights are being infringed upon, railways should bear this task, especially in terms of labor. The appropriate use of railway freight rates can have the same effect as customs policy, encouraging domestic products, resisting foreign goods, and gradually changing transportation to land transportation, resisting foreign monopolies on China's rivers and seas. Taking the number of important railway lines in the country, the Pingpu line, from Tianjin to the Yangtze River, is full of sea-going ships, competing with the railways. According to the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce's investigation of Hebei province goods that are transferred to foreign countries through Tianjin port, ships carry seven out of ten, and among the ships, foreign ships account for five out of seven, and Chinese ships account for two out of seven. The reason why the majority of people choose ship transport is because there are too few vehicles and the freight rates are too expensive. As for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, which are located in the water country, in addition to river steamers, inland river ferries are common everywhere. River ferries also offer discounts to attract customers. For long distances, the Longhai and Shandong lines are mostly loaded onto ships in Dapu and transported to Shanghai. Those shipped from Shanghai are also transported by sea to Dapu, and then transferred to the Longhai line for short distances. Goods from Ningzhen are transported by river ferries, and goods from Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Shanghai are transported by inland river ferries. The hidden losses suffered by the railways are difficult to calculate. At the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Commercial Conferences, there were 200 proposals, and proposals on assessing special prices and reducing freight accounted for one-fourth. It can be seen that reducing freight is a universal desire in the commercial community. It is believed that reducing railway freight rates has two meanings: (1) to attract customers and compete with water transport, which is for its own business, and also to recover the outflow of shipping profits. There are many types of goods, and it is difficult to guess at one time. We should first pass the principle of reducing the prices of various goods, and then set up a freight rate reduction investigation committee within each road bureau, which will, together with the local chambers of commerce and transportation associations, investigate and list the prices of various goods by car and the current prices of ships, compare them one by one, and then consider reducing them appropriately. (2) In order to develop domestic products and revitalize industries, we should select those industrial products that are still in their infancy and that have intense competition from foreign goods, and give them preferential treatment, greatly reducing their freight rates, so that they can develop in the market and gradually overwhelm foreign goods. This is what is meant by cooperating with customs policy. Based on this purpose, the current freight rates for various industrial products and the proposed revisions to the freight rates are listed below, selecting the most important ones: (1) Flour. Flour mills use wheat as raw material. Although wheat production in the Nanjing area is abundant, the South Manchuria Railway's rights are in the hands of foreigners, and freight rates are expensive. Purchasing and transporting from the south is not cost-effective. It is necessary to use foreign wheat. The freight from Canada to Shanghai is 24 cents per 100 pounds, which is only 1.1 yuan in national currency. The wheat north of the Huai River, such as that produced in Xuzhou and Bengbu, costs 1.57 yuan per 100 pounds from Xuzhou to Shanghai, and 1.45 yuan per 100 pounds from Bengbu to Shanghai. The freight charged is one-third more expensive than shipping foreign wheat. As a result, wheat production in Henan and Anhui provinces cannot be fully utilized and is instead transferred to Canada. The loss to the national economy is incalculable. It is proposed to greatly reduce the freight rates to facilitate transportation and benefit domestic production. (2) Cigarettes. The number of Chinese cigarette factories has decreased from 200 to dozens. Foreign imports account for 15% of the national cigarette business, foreign merchants in China account for 60%, and Chinese cigarette factories are oppressed by foreign merchants. Urgent measures should be taken to remedy this situation. In 1925, the railway freight for cigarettes was charged according to the fourth class, but now it has been changed to the second class. Foreign cigarette sales are very large. Each time they transport cigarettes, they must book several freight cars. Therefore, the freight is calculated by tonnage, which is cheaper. Chinese cigarette sales are small, and they are transported in boxes, so the fee is higher. Therefore, in order to maintain Chinese cigarette factories, it is proposed to: 1. Restore the old regulations and charge according to the fourth class. 2. The freight rates for boxes and vehicles should be adjusted so that the difference in fees is not too large. (3) Soap. Soap is divided into three categories: 1. Foreign imports 2. Manufactured by foreign merchants in China 3. Manufactured by Chinese merchants in China. Among the three, the products of foreign merchants in China have the largest sales. The total sales of Chinese factories are less than 20%. The railway freight for soap is only 1 cent less per load for domestic soap than for foreign soap. From Shanghai to Nanjing, the freight for foreign soap (Xiangmao coarse soap) is 2.6 cents per load, and the freight for domestic soap (Guben coarse soap) is 2.5 cents per load. From Shanghai to Xuzhou, the freight for foreign soap (Xiangmao coarse soap) is 1.8 cents per load, and the freight for domestic soap (Guben coarse soap) is 1.7 cents per load. With the fierce competition from foreign goods and the strong capital of foreign merchants, a freight difference of 1 cent per load is not enough to show the effect of maintaining domestic products. It is requested that it be reduced as much as possible within the possible range. (4) Candles. Chinese merchants who set up factories to imitate candles purchase their high-end raw materials from the Asiatic Petroleum Company. The company itself manufactures White Light candles. Therefore, Chinese factories purchase raw materials from it, and their fate is undoubtedly in the hands of the Asiatic Petroleum Company. The freight charged by the railways is the same for Chinese and foreign factories. For example, the freight for White Light candles from Shanghai to Hangzhou is 2.95 yuan per load, plus a pass-through fee of 0.376 yuan. The freight for domestic candles is also charged at this rate. Compared with the soap freight, the support for Chinese factories seems insufficient. It is requested that the freight be reduced proportionally to support domestic products. (5) Eggs. Railway freight for eggs has always been listed as the third class in the regulations (both fresh and processed). Egg yolk is listed as the fourth class. In 1930, the new regulations were revised to list egg yolk and egg white in the second class and scheduled to be implemented on May 1st of that year. After two appeals to the ministry to express difficulties, it was allowed to be extended for one year, until the end of April of this year. The egg factory business has been around for forty years. Since foreign merchants began buying fresh eggs in China, the egg factory business has plummeted. Recently, it has been affected by the American import quota, and eggs are not allowed to land. The losses are even greater. It is requested that the new regulations for egg freight rates be cancelled and that the old regulations be followed in order to maintain the business. (6) Kerosene. Although this item is not a domestic product, the businesses operating in this field are divided into Chinese merchants and foreign merchants. Foreign merchants, such as Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum companies, pay only 70% of the railway freight for their kerosene. Chinese merchants, such as Guanghua Kerosene Company and China-America Coal Oil Company, must pay the full amount. Such biased treatment is tantamount to allowing foreign merchants to monopolize the kerosene business. It is proposed that the fees be changed to 70% across the board in order to show fairness. Whether the above items are appropriate or not, it is requested that a public decision be made."</p>
<h3>Fifth Committee Meeting of the Various Industries Tax Regulations Association</h3>
<p>▲ Business tax for the money industry is expected to be exempted</p>
<p>The Tax Regulations Research Committee organized by the trade associations of various industries in this city held its fifth committee meeting yesterday. Zheng Xiqing chaired the meeting. The resolutions were as follows: (1) Regarding the requests from the fruit and local goods industry, the hotel industry, and the western paint industry to forward the proposal to reduce the business tax rate, it was resolved to submit it to the Ministry of Finance. (2) It is proposed to notify all commercial establishments in the country that if the business tax rate has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance, they should not pay it in violation of the order. It was resolved to publish it in the newspaper and notify the trade associations of various industries and chambers of commerce in various regions. (4) Regarding Zheng Yüsün's letter stating his opinion on the distribution of business among trade associations, it was resolved to temporarily store it. Other important cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tax Regulations Research Committee received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, which stated: "To the Tax Regulations Research Committee of the Trade Associations of Various Industries in Shanghai. I have read Zhen's telegram. After investigation, the draft business tax regulations for Jiangsu Province have been approved and sent to the ministry by the provincial government. Regarding the tax rate for the money industry, it should be reviewed separately and then replied to the provincial government to instruct the finance department to comply. Please be informed. [Official Seal of the Ministry of Finance]."</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry: The Shanghai Ginseng and Bird's Nest Trade Association submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating that ginseng and bird's nest are nourishing medicinal products, not luxury goods, and requested a reduction in the business tax rate. The document stated: "After the abolition of the Likin tax, the business tax was implemented, originally based on the scope of business, to avoid the heavy burden of separate tax collection based on goods. If, within the scope of business, taxes are further levied based on the types of goods, it is no different from the separate tax collection based on goods under the Likin system. This is greatly incomprehensible. If it is said that ginseng and bird's nest are luxury goods, then the tax rates in various provinces and cities should not be different. Why is the tax rate in Jiangsu Province 20 per thousand, in Zhejiang Province 15 per thousand, and in Hubei Province 5 per thousand? This is greatly incomprehensible, part two. Ginseng and bird's nest are the only tonics, either to supplement before illness or to supplement after illness, both of which are necessary. If, because of the high price, they are regarded as luxury goods, then all expensive medicines can be treated with hostility and have their taxes increased, and increasing the price is no different from cutting off the lives of patients. This is greatly incomprehensible, part three. The sale of ginseng and bird's nest not only includes ginseng and bird's nest, but also various accompanying products, all of which are included in the category of ginseng and bird's nest, then the heavy tax will also affect products beyond ginseng and bird's nest. This is greatly incomprehensible, part four. Moreover, the products sold by the ginseng and bird's nest industry are mostly domestic goods, produced in provinces such as Guandong, Jilin, and Sichuan. Although a small portion may not be entirely domestic goods, for those related to imported goods, there are existing methods to increase import duties, ban them, and restrict them. It is not appropriate to increase the business tax on domestic sales on top of the increased customs duties. This is greatly incomprehensible, part five." In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting review, it is appropriate to submit this document to request review and instruct a proper discussion on reducing the ginseng and bird's nest business tax, treating it equally with the pharmaceutical industry, to conform to the facts and avoid partiality, which would be greatly appreciated. Submitted.</p>
<p>▲ Fruits and Local Produce Industry: The Shanghai Fruits and Local Produce Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating (above omitted): "Upon investigation of the business tax taxation standards and tax rate tables established by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they not only exceed the Ministry's outlined guidelines, but also the taxation standards are greatly inconsistent with the Ministry's established methods. According to Article 2, Item 2 of the outline of the methods, the brokers industry should be taxed at 2 per thousand of the total brokerage fees received. However, the draft collection regulations proposed by various provinces do not mention a single word about the collection methods for the brokers industry. Is it regarded as a sales industry and treated separately? Or is it exempt from collection according to the provisions of Supplementary Method No. 10? However, according to Supplementary Method No. 11, taxes such as brokerage tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes similar to business tax must be separated and combined according to the outline. However, for the sake of temporarily approving the original plan for local revenue, it can be done in two steps: The first step is to rename taxes such as brokerage tax, pawn tax, and slaughter tax as business tax, and the tax rate will still be collected according to the original tax rate for each item of brokerage, pawn, and slaughter, as a temporary transitional measure. The second step is that after the business tax is processed, the above-mentioned original tax rate will be changed to the business tax rate for collection, so as to achieve uniformity. Then, the brokers industry is also included in the regulations, so that there is a basis when the second step is completed and uniformly merged. If it is said that during this transition period, the brokerage tax is still collected according to the original tax rate for each item, and then business tax is collected separately according to the sales industry, then the brokers industry bears the obligation to pay two types of taxes, which seems to be unfair and involves harming merchants and harming the government. Furthermore, upon investigation of the tax rates for the sale of goods, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have set the tax rate for mountain goods and local goods at 2 per thousand, and the tax rate for fruits at 10 per thousand. Moreover, the tax rates set for wholesale and retail vary between the two provinces, which is several times different from the 2 per thousand tax rate based on the amount of brokerage fees received. However, the members of the fruit and local produce industry are all brokerage firms that only take commissions (i.e., brokerage fees) for selling goods on behalf of customers. Most of the goods are wholesale, and those who specialize in retail have separate shops and peddlers. The shopkeepers are all small businesses, and the peddlers mostly carry baskets and carry baskets. If the shopkeepers are required to pay huge taxes, it is no different from a small boat carrying a heavy load, which will inevitably capsize, and it will be difficult for them to make a living. It is better to become peddlers and sell freely without the obligation to pay taxes. However, there will be a loss in tax revenue. Moreover, fruits and local produce are all daily necessities, neither luxury goods nor items that should be banned. The tax rates set by Jiangsu and Zhejiang are so high that they go against the National Government's policy of benefiting the people, and it can be said that they do not understand the business situation and arbitrarily set them. As for the collection method, it should be simple and direct, with the industry as the unit. That is, if one store operates several industries, the main business should be the basis, and it should not be classified and collected, which would cause a lot of trouble. Otherwise, the harm of harassment is greater than Likin. Furthermore, upon investigation, the bookkeeping of our country's businesses has always been inconsistent, and each has its own name. Now that the business tax is being implemented, the collection of taxes must be based on evidence, and bookkeeping is a very important certificate in business. It seems that there is a need for reform, and it is necessary to make the names uniform throughout the country. If the legislation is uniform, there will be no discrepancies, which will greatly benefit the collection procedures. The businesses of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are closely related, and it is not convenient to remain silent. Therefore, we have briefly stated our views in the letter and request your association to submit it to the Tax Rules Research Committee for research, and also hope to forward it to the authorities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and our city, so that the tax rates set will be formulated and implemented in accordance with the Ministry's outline, which will be a great blessing to the merchants and the people, and a great blessing to the country." Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Director Zhong of the International Telecommunications Bureau Takes Office</h3>
<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, resigned due to busy official duties and mental exhaustion, especially internal affairs. He went to Beijing last week to meet with Wang Boqun, Minister of Transportation, to request resignation. Minister Wang retained him and granted him one month's leave. However, the duties of the Telecommunications Bureau are important and cannot be without someone in charge, so Zhong E was ordered to temporarily act as the director. Zhong came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday with Xu Liang, an engineer from the Nanjing Wireless Station of the Ministry of Transportation. At 9:00 am yesterday, he went to the Lao Bei Men International Telecommunications Bureau to take over the office and summoned Lu Hongxun, Chief of the General Affairs Section, Liu Naiyu, Chief of the Accounting Section, Zhao Yi, Chief of the Wireless Section, and Shen Hai, Chief of the Wireline Section, to talk. Zhong E, styled Bingfeng, is from Guangdong. After graduating from Nanyang University, he studied at the University of Wisconsin in the United States. After returning to China, he successively served as the director of the Tianjin and Beiping Telephone Bureaus. Last year, he was ordered by the National Government to serve as a member of the Northeast Transportation Committee. His coming south this time is to take up this post.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Establish International Trade Bureau in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Reorganization of the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau</p>
<p>▲ Zhao Jinqing to be Appointed as Deputy Minister</p>
<p>▲ Guo Bingwen Resigns as Preparatory Member</p>
<p>In view of the declining state of Chinese industry and commerce, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, specially planned to establish the International Trade Bureau in Shanghai to develop international trade and connect with commercial commissioners from various countries, and appointed Guo (yesterday's Beijing telegram in this newspaper mistakenly wrote Zou for Guo) Bingwen and others as preparatory members. The news yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Reorganization of the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau: The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce established an office and an Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau in Shanghai for the convenience of the industry and commerce community in the city. Last year, it was ordered by the Ministry to cancel it and transfer all affairs of the Shanghai office to the Visiting Bureau to continue handling. Recently, Minister Kong considered international trade to be an important plan for the present, reorganized the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau into the International Trade Bureau, and planned to appoint Guo Bingwen as the director and Shou Jingwei as the deputy director to actively plan concrete measures to develop international commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Zhao Jinqing to be Appointed as Deputy Minister: The current director of the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau is Zhao Jinqing. Since Minister Kong appointed him to this position, he has planned well and developed many plans for the development of industry and commerce. Mu Ouchu, the current permanent deputy minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, resigned again and again. Yesterday, it was heard that Minister Kong had approved his resignation and appointed Zhao to succeed him as deputy minister. However, Zhao will leave Shanghai soon, and he is determined not to take the position of deputy minister. He expressed his agreement with Guo's coming to form the International Trade Bureau and asked Guo about the date of taking over the matter and hoped that Mu would not insist on resigning, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Guo Bingwen Sends Letter Resigning Appointment: Guo has recently received a personal instruction from Minister Kong to organize the affairs of the International Trade Bureau and has repeatedly declined the appointment. Yesterday, he read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had issued an order the day before yesterday appointing him as a preparatory member. Yesterday, he sent a quick letter to Kong requesting him to withdraw his order and appoint other capable people because he urgently needs to go abroad to serve as the Chinese representative at the sixth conference of the International Chamber of Commerce held in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h3>British Postal Ship Khiva Catches Fire En Route</h3>
<p>▲ Second-Class Cabins Destroyed</p>
<p>▲ Fortunately, Cargo and Passengers Were Not Injured</p>
<p>▲ Fire Breaks Out Mid-Sea: The British Wheel Shipping Company's British-Chinese Class Formal Postal Ship Khiva, weighing 9,135 tons, came to Shanghai from London this time to go to Japan. Later, because Dalian had a large batch of soybeans to be shipped to Europe, the ship went to Japan and went straight to Dalian. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the shipowner Du Huixun (Capt. E. E. N. Dawson), saying that when the ship reached the sea near Dalian, the passenger section suddenly caught fire. The entire crew and sailors were immediately ordered to implement maritime fire protection, take pumps, draw seawater, and shoot hard. At the same time, the cargo holds and passenger seats that had not been delayed were protected to block the fire. Because the flames were fierce, rescue was very difficult and lasted a long time. It was not extinguished until it arrived in Dalian.</p>
<p>▲ All of the Second Cabin Burned: The cause of the fire has not yet been determined and is currently under investigation. This accident started in the second-class cabin and spread very quickly. More than 20 second-class cabins were completely burned, and all the utensils, beds, chairs, and various decorations in the cabins were not saved and were all burned. Fortunately, the first-class cabins were not burned thanks to rescue efforts. After inspection, only three or four incomplete and dilapidated second cabins were left. The loss of burned items and cabins was very large, and the supplies were specially made. The shipowner has now ordered the destroyed area to be isolated, pending review by the head office.</p>
<p>▲ Handling of Aftermath: Yesterday, the company also received a telegram from the shipowner, saying that the hull was not damaged and the cargo and passengers were safe. It will leave Dalian for Shanghai that day and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. The ship will dock at the Gonghexing Wharf. Yesterday, the company has notified all passengers that those who have booked second-class cabins cannot board due to the incident and will be transferred to first-class cabins. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for England on March 3. The burned areas will be overhauled in London.</p>
<h3>Collection of Exhibits for the Chinese National Products Exhibition Hall in Jukong, Sumatra</h3>
<p>▲ Commissioner Yang Huiguang Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, acting as the agent for the Chinese National Products Exhibition Hall in Jukong, Sumatra, to collect exhibits, specially sent Commissioner Yang Huiguang to Shanghai to contact domestic product manufacturers on matters related to soliciting exhibits, and organized a collection office at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall.</p>
<h3>Instructions of the Municipal Training Committee to the National Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>▲ The Employer Must Not Deliberately Violate the Labor-Management Contract</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department's Public Training Committee, based on a report from the preparatory committee of the Municipal Pharmaceutical Industry Union, stated that the employer of Yize Pharmaceutical violated the treaty and dismissed two employees without reason, requesting strict orders to correct the situation. After receiving the report, the committee stated that all labor unions or employee unions are currently being reorganized. Before the new contract is signed and the old treaty is reviewed and explicitly revoked, the old labor-management contract should continue to be valid and should not be violated. In addition to replying to the Pharmaceutical Industry Preparatory Committee, it also instructed the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association to instruct corrections and ordered Yize Pharmaceutical to report the reasons for dismissing employees for verification.</p>
<h3>The Civil Livelihood Research Association Held its Third Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Today's Discussion is on Modern Industry</p>
<p>The Civil Livelihood Improvement Research Association continued to hold its third meeting yesterday to discuss small-scale industrial issues. More than 60 representatives from various places attended the meeting in two sessions, morning and afternoon. The chairman was Zhong Keto, and the recorder was Zhang Shizhang. The meeting situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Report Matters: In the morning, (1) Xiang Wei reported that the Suzhou Weishan Youth Association Rural Service Department, in view of the difficult life of farmers, advocated reeling silk to increase farmers' income. It is estimated that each person can earn 30-40 cents per day. Other plans are still in progress and are presided over by the Side Business Improvement Association. (2) Chen Sheng reported on the impact of industrialization in Wuxi on rural side businesses. (3) Dai Leren reported on the situation of rural side businesses in North China and proposed that China's rural side business policy should have (a) credit cooperatives to run farmers' banks, (b) establish expert guidance centers, (c) establish training centers, and (d) organize purchasing and marketing cooperatives. In the afternoon, (1) Chen Zhongming reported on the history and organization of the China Cooperative Society and described the recent developments in the cooperative movement in China. (2) Wang Zhihua reported on the history of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank and said that according to the three-year plan, 3% of farmers who borrow money cannot repay it on time, and 1% of the money cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>▲ Discussion Matters: (A) China's Small-Scale Industrial Plan (1) Many small producers within the same area can form an alliance. (2) For the production entity, stipulate a credit loan method, either based on the principles of cooperatives or through national banks, as long as it can meet the needs of the environment. (3) Establish specialized guidance and research institutes for the benefit of production groups and provide them with the necessary training in improved methods. (4) Establish cooperative organizations to obtain the equipment, raw materials, etc. needed in industry. (5) Various collective sales organizations. If the local society is very advanced, it is best to establish cooperatives to gather the products of each producer and standardize these products. (6) Use collective power to obtain electricity supply. (B) Cooperative Business (1) Management must be democratic, that is, one person, one vote, unlike the general one-share, one-vote system under capitalism, because it is a combination of capital, while the cooperative is a combination of people, and capital is definitely not the main reason for their combination. (2) Shareholders' capital, in addition to the official interest rate that should be obtained and at most equal to the market price, there is no dividend to enjoy, because capital has been regarded as a necessary servant of the cause, and it is definitely not the master of the cause. The issuance of official interest is equal to the wages paid to the servant. (3) There is no limit to the number of members. Anyone who intends to join can join the society at any time, and members cannot be arbitrarily expelled from their membership unless they endanger the behavior of the cooperative. (4) There is no fixed amount of capital, but each member's share capital should have a considerable limit. (5) People who cannot afford to buy shares should also be given the opportunity to join the cooperative, that is, because he earns more from trading with the cooperative, he will gradually deduct it as share capital.</p>
<p>▲ Today's Agenda: The topic for discussion this morning is modern industry, address is No. 23 Yuanmingyuan Road. Zhu Cheng will give a public speech on the process and implementation time of the Labor Law at 7:30 pm, address is the Youth Association on Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>No Further Extension for Obtaining Certificates for Transporting Matches to Other Places</h3>
<p>▲ Tobacco Merchants Pay Attention</p>
<p>The unified tax on matches must be registered for transportation to other places. The Unified Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has limited each merchant to register with the Bureau before the 28th of this month to obtain a certificate, and to clearly indicate the destination. The tobacco merchants in this city who wholesale matches, in view of the urgent deadline and the fear that it will not be easy to sell them all, specially sent representatives Chen Liangyu, Qian Wenda, Shen Weiting, and Xi Zhixiang to meet with Director Yao Jiaqi of the Unified Tax Bureau. After the representatives stated their petition opinions, Director Yao replied that he had previously approved the requests from various industries to extend the deadline, and the deadline for registering and selling all goods by the 28th of this month had already been notified to various industries in writing. He also hoped that the gentlemen would inform their colleagues that those who have not registered or obtained a certificate should quickly register with the Bureau on Weihaiwei Road and obtain a certificate before the 28th to transport the goods, and not delay, otherwise they will be punished. At this point, the representatives said goodbye and returned to the association to report to their colleagues.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Issues February Salaries</h3>
<p>The February salaries for the police officers of each district and team under the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau have been reported to the Municipal Government by Director Chen and allocated to the Bureau by the Finance Bureau. Yesterday, Director Chen notified the chiefs of each district and team to quickly send the salary book to the Bureau, and they will come to the Bureau on the 28th (i.e., Saturday) morning to collect the salaries due and return to the precinct to wait for personnel to be sent to the precinct to supervise the roll call and distribution.</p>
<h3>Two Road Police Chiefs Sworn into Office</h3>
<p>Deng Zuyu, the police chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, went to take over the handover the day before yesterday after being appointed, and it was scheduled to hold an inauguration ceremony and swear into office at 2:00 pm today at the office of the two road police in paragraph No. 59, Beiche Station Road, inviting people from all walks of life to participate, and the two road bureau will send personnel to supervise.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Disaster Relief in Suqian Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Relaying the Terrible Situation of the Suqian Disaster</p>
<p>The disaster situation in the counties north of the Yangtze River last year was the most serious in Suqian. It was not only hit by floods, but also looted by bandits, with murders, arson, looting, and cruelty. Although the local area has gradually been pacified by the National Army's suppression of bandits, the refugees after the looting, in this freezing weather, have no clothes or food, are suffering from hunger and cold, and are dying every day. The county magistrate of the county, along with public groups, jointly formed a disaster relief committee. In order to seek relief from fundraising agencies, they pushed representative Liu Ruzhen to run to the government and charitable groups in Shanghai to appeal for help. The Jiangsu Temporary Righteous Relief Association has been办义振 and has also received government approval to allocate relief funds. It is heard that Chairman Huang Boyu of the association, due to the widespread disaster and difficult fundraising, which is not enough to save the situation, also sent Liu Junrendu to those from the county who are traveling in Beijing to request assistance. Sun Bowen, Wu Hongchang, Liu Bochang, Liu Hongbin, Zhang Shiyi, and others invited more than 20 fellow villagers to discuss everything at the Xicheng Hostel. Liu Ruzhen recounted the tragic disaster in Suqian, with tears in his voice, moving everyone. The five people, including Sun Wu, successively discussed methods, all agreeing that the disaster situation is serious and the time is urgent, and without quickly raising funds to help, there is no way to save this strange disaster. They promised to raise relief funds in the shortest possible time and remit them to the Jiangsu Temporary Righteous Relief Association for distribution in the disaster area. On the one hand, Sun Bowen and others sent letters to fellow villagers traveling abroad to request donations in order to promote the righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association's Statistics on Children's Cases</h3>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation of children being harmed by social evil forces, so as to implement rescue and prevention methods, the China Child Welfare Association has carefully investigated all children's cases published in Shanghai newspapers, clipped them into a collection, created forms, classified and recorded them, accumulated over time, and prepared them for easy reference. Although the cases published in the newspapers are only a small fraction of the actual cases, the number is already considerable. The statistics are as follows: January 77 cases, February 36 cases, March 100 cases, April 57 cases, May 167 cases, June 161 cases, July 143 cases, August 151 cases, September 187 cases, October 154 cases, November 175 cases, December 237 cases, a total of 1,645 cases throughout the year, averaging more than 130 cases per month, which is indeed a considerable number. In terms of time, the number of cases is the highest in winter, the lowest in spring, and between the two in summer and autumn. The number of children burned to death increases in winter. The number of children drowned to death is the highest in summer. The rape of girls is discovered in the spring when the colors of spring are moving. The abuse of maids is gradually decreasing. Children hit by cars are increasing. The abduction and sale of children is relatively rare, and the number of lost children is relatively large. There is not much difference in other cases. It is heard that the Child Protection Department of the Child Welfare Association, in order to provide a reference for social sympathy, plans to attach detailed classified case statistics for the year in oil printing to meet the requests of those who care about social work.</p>
<h3>Report on Preparation for Issuance by the Four Banks</h3>
<p>▲ 60th Time</p>
<p>The Four Banks Reserve, jointly established by Yanyeh, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Mainland Banks, specializes in issuing Zhongnan Bank notes. The following is a verbatim record of the 60th announcement of the Shanghai Reserve on February 21, 20th year of the Republic: The amount of banknotes in circulation is 37,910,152 yuan. The total amount of reserves is 37,910,152 yuan, including cash reserves of 21,440,4616.42 yuan and guarantee reserves of 13,500,5535.58 yuan.</p>
<h3>Revenge for the Murder of His Father</h3>
<p>▲ Liu Tingzhu Brothers Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Found Liu Liangji to Avenge the Murder</p>
<p>▲ Both Lius Spoke with Certainty</p>
<p>▲ Liangji Was Also Detained</p>
<p>Liu Tingzhu from Xuzhou and his younger brother Tingyang injured their clansman Liu Liangji with an axe and fled on the evening of the 21st of this month. The Changshupu Police Station captured the two Lius the day before yesterday and handed them over to the Special District Local Court along with the murder weapon yesterday. Judge Feng interrogated them. According to the lawyer of the police station, Li Zhishan, the two defendants confessed that Liu Liangji had murdered their father and brother last year, and they were avenging their father. Until the day before yesterday, they found out that Liangji lived at No. 323 Yangshupu Road, so they went to assassinate him and presented the murder axe and letter to the court. According to Liu Liangji's confession, he worked as a watchman at the Yangshupu Wharf and had a money dispute with the defendant, which caused him to be slashed in the head five times. Questioned by the two defendants, he confessed that Liangji was his uncle and murdered my father and younger brother Xiaosan in his hometown in August last year. After hearing the news, we rushed back home overnight, but Liangji had already fled. On September 24, we filed a lawsuit in Suining County. Shi Xi Liangji came to Shanghai, so we tracked him down. The day before yesterday morning, we went to his residence to avenge our father and brother. Liangji denied the confessions of the Tingzhu brothers, and lawyer Li immediately stated that according to the defendant's confession, Liangji killed his father and brother, which seemed not to be fabricated. Please detain him as well for investigation. Judge Feng approved the request and ordered them to be detained pending investigation from Suining County.</p>
<h3>Four Bandits Executed</h3>
<p>Qian Fusheng, Ma Yaogui, Jiang Liusheng, and others, residents of Houjiaqiao, a suburb of Wusongkou, were robbed by sea bandits and the owners Xu Taosheng and his wife Zhang were shot and killed.

<p>▲ Bandits Who Looted Shushan Intercepted in Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang Yao, Wu Xiufeng, Han Ruisheng, Wang Zian, Liu Yongfu, and other detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that Wang Yao, a notorious bandit who first robbed the Shushan Town area under Yixing County in July of the lunar calendar last year, killing Qu Zhaoqi, the squad leader of the town's defense corps, and robbing weapons, has now sneaked into Shanghai and is hiding in the Yanziwo area, No. 14 Baoxingli, Dongxinqiao, Damalu, French Concession.

<h3>Famous Diamond Shop in Shanghai Robbed of Large Quantities of Valuables</h3>
<p>▲ Gentleman on the Beam Truly Comes from the Beam</p>
<p>▲ Breaking Through the Dome Roof and Descending by Rope</p>
<p>▲ Valuable Watches and Diamond Jewelry Stolen</p>
<p>▲ Shop Owner's Handgun Taken as Well</p>
<p>Diamond merchant Xinli Foreign Company is one of the leading diamond shops in Shanghai, with annual sales in the millions. Its customers are mostly wealthy businessmen and ladies, prominent merchants and officials, while ordinary people only glance at the window displays when passing by. Yesterday morning, in the faint light of dawn, the inside of the diamond shop was suddenly brightly lit with candles, and shadows flickered. Within minutes, a large team of armed police officers arrived in armored cars, and many astute detectives, with keen eyes, entered the house, climbed over obstacles, squatted on the ground, and felt the walls, appearing extremely busy. Readers, if you close your eyes and think for a moment, the first impression in your mind in this situation would undoubtedly be "Jewel theft." The time of the incident was around 4:30 yesterday morning. What was stolen were valuable wristwatches and small pieces of diamond jewelry, worth approximately 20,000 yuan. As for how the thieves entered the building and accessed this treasure trove, their planning was sophisticated, and their skills were particularly agile, deserving a new page in Shanghai's history of thieves.</p>
<p>Gentlemen on the beam always come at night. If it is at the time when the morning rooster is about to crow and the east is still dark, then every inch of time is precious. Because good dreams often last until dawn, skilled thieves can take this opportunity to display their skills without being noticed by the owner. The distinguished thief of Xinli Foreign Company acted around 4:30 a.m. for a particular reason. At that time, the first person to discover the theft was the night watchman, who saw an uninvited guest suddenly appear inside the shop. So, he sounded the alarm and asked for investigation. After receiving the alarm, the Central Police Station immediately sent detectives to rush to the scene for a large-scale search. However, the thieves were gone without a trace, leaving only one or two traces of their actions. When the initial detectives arrived at the door of Xinli Foreign Company on Nanjing Road, they saw iron fences and had no way to enter. Therefore, they urgently used the telephone to notify the shop owner, Mr. Bao Aishi. Mr. Bao jumped out of bed and rushed to the entrance of Xinli, opened the bag, took out the key, and opened the door to welcome the guests. The detectives were able to calmly enter and compare the conjectures from outside the door with the actual situation inside.</p>
<p>What did the interior look like? At this time, both host and guests were concerned about this question. However, after entering the room, turning on the lights, they saw that everything was in order, the jewelry was shining brightly, lightly surrounding the light, melting into a thin mist. The treasure mountain was as before, no different from usual, except that one cabinet inside was different from its original state because it had been broken, revealing that the items had grown wings and flown away. After inspection by the owner, more than a hundred watches and some jewelry were gone. Further inspection of the front and back doors showed that they were intact. But looking up at the ceiling, a flaw was immediately visible. The thief had indeed descended from the sky. A large piece of glass had been embedded in the ceiling in the shape of a dome. The thief drilled a hole in the roof, removed a corner of the glass, and then tied a rope to his body and lowered himself down, thereby directly reaching the center, breaking the cabinet, and taking the goods. After being drunk and full, he still left by the same route. The thief's subsequent actions are impossible to guess. However, there is still one thing that is strange: the shop owner, Bao Aishi, had a handgun hidden in the desk drawer, which, like a daughter marrying with a dowry, followed the others and disappeared together, all escaping from the air.</p>
<p>Xinli Foreign Company is located at No. 105 Nanjing Road, east of Sullivan and opposite Woolen. It is flanked by Mouderli Piano Company, Siberian Jewelry Company, and Murray Candy Store. The diamonds, jewelry, and rare and valuable items it sells are second to none in Shanghai. The estimated value of the items stolen yesterday morning is at least 18,000 yuan. Although the value of the jewelry stolen in Woolen's case a few years ago differed greatly, the details and layout were comparable. It can be said that the former surpassed the latter. It is rumored that the Central Police Station arrested two people a few hours after the incident, but after questioning, they were found to be innocent and released shortly after. According to the patrolman, the thief seemed to be wearing a suit, perhaps done by a foreign master who had drifted to sea, which is also unknown. However, Xinli's business continued as usual yesterday, so passersby still saw exquisite and precious objects in the glass windows, shining brightly and directly hitting the eyes of passersby.</p>
<h3>Silver Shop Robbed in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Thieves Open Fire, Injuring Three People</p>
<p>Detectives Surround and Capture One Bandit</p>
<p>▲ Veteran Thief Claims to be Exchanging Gold Rings</p>
<p>▲ Thieves Enter in Succession</p>
<p>▲ Result: No Gold Obtained</p>
<p>▲ Lao Fengxiang Loses Tens of Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, six bandits suddenly broke into Lao Hongxiang Silver Shop at No. 1204 Xin Zha Road and robbed it. Fortunately, after receiving a distress call from neighboring shops, they immediately reported the crime to the Xin Zha Road Police Station, and detectives surrounded and suppressed the bandits. One bandit was captured in Jucing Alley. When the bandits were robbing, they opened fire in the shop and in the alley to resist arrest, injuring Sun Jiejun, the accountant of the silver shop, a woman named Shen Cuie, and a child who were passing by. Fortunately, the injuries were minor. Lao Hongxiang's loss was also minimal, totaling 60 paper money and 226 small silver coins.</p>
<p>▲ Gold is Expensive and Silver is Cheap, Customer Exchanges Gold Ring. Around lunchtime yesterday noon, when the partners of Lao Hongxiang Silver Shop were about to have a meal, three customers suddenly entered the shop in succession. Two were young, one was old, and they all spoke with a foreign accent. They stood outside the counter and claimed to be exchanging gold rings. At this time, the two young men stood together, while the old man was talking and walking inside. Manager Wang Dingcheng thought that in this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, what kind of good customers would come to exchange gold rings? He looked closely at the man, and although his clothes were decent, his behavior was suspicious. Just as he was about to ask, the old thief rushed towards Wang's chest and held the gun against his chest. As quick as lightning, the two young bandits did not say a word and flew over the counter. The partners at that time were standing dumbfounded next to the dining table, not knowing what to say. Just as they were looking at each other, three more heroes came from outside the door. Two went straight upstairs, and one kept watch at the door. However, the two bandits who went upstairs quickly came down the stairs again because there was no way out upstairs. They cooperated with the two bandits in the shop. So, on the one hand, they drove the manager and all the partners to the corner of the room, and on the other hand, they opened drawers and turned over money boxes to find the so-called gold. However, gold was hard to find, and their efforts were fruitless. They had to condescend and take 60 yuan in paper money and hundreds of small silver coins from the counter and walk away. But at the time of parting, a strange noise suddenly came. Accountant Sun Jiejun fell to the ground after being shot.</p>
<p>▲ Three People Injured, One Bandit Captured. Accountant Sun Jiejun was originally upstairs. After seeing the two bandits who went upstairs coming down the stairs, he also moved down and held the police whistle in his hand to blow it. Seeing that Sun was about to ruin the matter, the bandit fired a shot, hitting the tail ring of the whistle. However, Sun's ring finger on his left hand also fell off with the ring. He was injured and fell to the ground. However, the force of the bullet did not stop there. After hitting Sun's hand, it broke the washbasin until it encountered the wet towel in the basin and stopped its surging power. Since Sun was bleeding, the bandits also grabbed the loot and scattered. However, when the partners were imprisoned in the corner of the room by the bandits, they pressed the alarm bell pre-installed to notify the neighboring Da Chun Nanhua Store. After receiving the distress call, Da Chun was about to blow the whistle to launch an attack, but the bandit on watch remotely forbade it with the muzzle of a gun, ordering him not to make a sound. Fortunately, there were more people than bandits, and the police station was finally notified by telephone. A group of fleeing bandits escaped into No. 309 Jucing Alley, east of Lao Hongxiang, where they were caught on the spot by detectives. However, during the fight between the two sides, more than ten shots were fired. The passersby, Shen Cuie and a child, were injured by stray bullets, one in the foot and one in the back. It was not a major problem.</p>
<p>▲ Robbed Twice, Fortunately No Major Loss. After receiving the news, the reporter went to Lao Hongxiang to inquire about the actual situation, which was roughly as described above. Manager Wang said that his shop had been robbed twice, once the year before and the second time yesterday. It is said that daylight robbery of silver shops in Shanghai has become commonplace, so he has also taken the utmost precautions. When the bandits entered the shop, it happened to be mealtime. If it were on a normal day, they would have already taken action. This afternoon, because there were distinguished guests, they had prepared fine wine, but the thieves descended before the wine came. So, what the guests ate was only shock. When the bandits grabbed the silver coins, they were anxious to hide them and wanted to put them in their pockets, but they felt uncomfortable. So, they used their sleeves as a shortcut, raised their arms upwards, and the paper money slipped into the sleeves. However, the thieves made a mistake. The sleeves led straight to the bottom of the front, and this road led directly to the ground, so the silver coins clanged and left a lot on the ground. The reporter applauded each other after hearing this. However, the daffodils on the desk were unscathed, and the wax plums in the pot were smiling. Seeing this after the shock can also be a self-deprecating. The owner wished him good luck, and the owner smiled and sent the guests out the door.</p>
<h3>Cheng Linsheng Received Seven Extortion Letters</h3>
<p>▲ Done by a Car Driver in Training</p>
<p>▲ Also Involving the Gatekeeper and Accountant</p>
<p>Cheng Linsheng, a wealthy merchant from Huizhou in Shanghai, suddenly received an intimidating letter on the 29th of last month, demanding 10,000 yuan. It directed him to place the money on the grass outside his residence at No. 1550 Jing'an Temple Road, and someone would come to retrieve it. Cheng smiled and ignored it. Unexpectedly, the extortionist, because his demand was not met, continued to send letters to Cheng, demanding the money, using extremely intimidating language. As of the 22nd of this month, he had received as many as seven such letters, and the amount demanded had gradually increased to 30,000 yuan. Cheng could not bear it and sent all the letters to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for investigation. Detectives Jin Yangwu, Liu Ronggen, and Western detective Robert were assigned to investigate. Because there were many servants in the Cheng family, good and bad were mixed, and it was worth paying attention to. They questioned the servants one by one and found that Gu Wannian, a car driver in training from Hubei, who only earned two yuan a month, dressed luxuriously, which was very suspicious. So, Gu was arrested and taken to the police station for thorough interrogation. Gu confessed that he had written five threatening letters at the request of Zhang Changshan and Yang Zhenyuan. Zhang was from Shandong and worked as a doorkeeper at Cheng's residence at No. 663. Yang was from Tianjin and worked as a bodyguard at Yu Yiqing's residence at No. 116 Yuyuan Road. The other two letters were written by Wang Rusong, Cheng's accountant. Chinese and Western detectives then arrested Zhang, Yang, and Wang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted Gu and others under Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Anti-Kidnapping Regulations. Lawyer Wang stated that Gu Wannian admitted that he had written the first to fifth letters, and the sixth and seventh letters were written by Wang Rusong, while he only wrote the envelopes. His confession at the police station was also in his own handwriting, so it was completely identical to the handwriting in the threatening letters. He also presented the letters and confession as evidence. Then, Qin Shao, the chief accountant of the Cheng family, appeared in court on behalf of his master to testify, saying that Gu had been learning to drive for three or four years. He then described the situation of his master receiving threatening letters one after another. Judge Wu read the sixth and seventh letters and asked if they were written by Wang Rusong. After Qin inspected them, he replied that the characters on the letters were very elegant, while Wang's characters were very bad, and he was certain that they were not written by Wang. Later, when Gu Wannian was questioned, he confessed that the matter began on the morning of December 11th or 12th. He, Yang, Zhang, Wang, etc., secretly discussed it in the gatehouse of Cheng's mansion. Zhang drafted the letter, and he was ordered to copy it. The original draft was immediately destroyed. From the first letter to the fifth letter, it was done in this way. The sixth and seventh letters were written by Wang, and the postage stamps needed were provided by Zhang, who bought them and sent them by mail. Zhang Changshan confessed that he had been working as a doorkeeper at Cheng's mansion for only seven months, with a salary of 19 yuan per month. He knew nothing about Cheng receiving threatening letters. He was illiterate, so how could he draft them? Yang also denied colluding in the extortion. Wang Rusong confessed that he was a storyteller before and is now an accountant at Cheng's mansion, with a monthly salary of 60 yuan. He goes to Cheng's house to work every morning at 10 o'clock and returns to his residence at 10 o'clock at night. How could he have secretly discussed it with Gu and others at 8 o'clock in the morning? Moreover, the master treats him very well. He is not insane enough to commit this illegal act. Gu is usually lazy and often comes to the accounting room to falsely claim transportation expenses. He once rebuked him, and he held a grudge. Now he is falsely accusing him. Judge Wu re-examined the seven letters in detail. Their handwriting was similar to that of one person, and the characters were elegant, which did not seem to be something that Gu Wannian could write. So, he continued to interrogate Gu strictly. At this point, Gu suddenly overturned his previous confession, saying that he did not know about this matter either. The confessions he made at the police station were not voluntary. Everything he said just now was not true, because he was afraid that he would suffer pain if he did not follow the confession he made at the police station. Judge Wu, because Cheng Linsheng had not arrived and further investigation was necessary, ordered the defendants to be detained and ordered Cheng to appear in court on another day for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case Against the Small Owner of a Sock Factory for Enticement and Adultery</h3>
<p>▲ Lawyer Ye Asks About Business Dealings</p>
<p>▲ Shen Meimei Responds That It's Nonsense</p>
<p>▲ Defendant Requests Witnesses Qingfeng and Aiyue to Testify</p>
<p>▲ Rescheduled for Further Hearing on April 4th</p>
<p>Zhong Xiaoqi, the small owner of a Guangdong sock factory, previously had a romantic relationship with Shen Li's daughter, Meimei (age 29), who lived nearby in Suzhou. They engaged in clandestine affairs, not just once. Recently, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a child around December of the lunar calendar last year. However, after Meimei's delivery, Zhong Xiaoqi suddenly abandoned her, leading Shen Li to accuse Zhong of adultery and abandonment in the Special District Court. The court had previously heard the case, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xie-fen convened the court again for further hearings. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Shen Xingxia, and the defendant was represented by lawyer Ye Fu-kang. Lawyer Shen, representing the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff requested the civil portion of the case be transferred to the civil court, and voluntarily dropped the abandonment charges, only requesting punishment under Articles 257 and related regulations of the Criminal Code. Then, the plaintiff Shen Li testified, "I came to Shanghai when I was a little over ten years old. My daughter lived with my elder brother and his wife. I initially didn't know about Meimei's relationship with the defendant. Last October, I came to Shanghai for my daughter-in-law's medical treatment and saw my daughter with a large belly. When I questioned her, I learned about her affair with the defendant. According to the defendant, he would raise any child born from the relationship and was willing to marry her. However, after the birth, the defendant abandoned her." Shen Meimei testified, "Around June of the year before last, when I was enjoying the cool air and washing clothes at the door, the defendant often asked me to go see movies. By September, he asked me to meet him for a secret rendezvous at the Pingqiao Hotel. I initially refused, but the defendant said, 'If your parents find out, I'll marry you.' I was then enticed. Afterwards, I frequently stayed at hotels like Tianran and Pingqiao." Judge Xiao asked, "Have you ever rented rooms with others?" She replied, "No." He also asked, "The defendant claims you were a prostitute in the Changsan brothel." She replied, "That's completely untrue." "When was the child born?" She replied, "Around December of last year." "When did your mother find out about this?" She replied, "Last October." At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Ye Fu-kang, requested to ask Shen Li and Shen Meimei a few questions, which the court allowed. Lawyer Ye immediately asked Shen Li, "Do you run a 'Swallow's Nest'?" She replied, "No." "Do you smoke opium?" She replied, "I used to, but I quit last year." "Do you run a club?" She replied, "No." "What do your two sons do for a living?" She replied, "One is a waiter, and the other works at a theater." "Who are Qingfeng the sixth elder of Minhe Lane and Aiyue the sixth elder of Huile Lane to you?" She replied, "I don't know." "If evidence is presented to prove your daughter was a prostitute, what will you do?" She remained silent. He also asked Shen Meimei, "Did you rent a house with the defendant?" She replied, "No." "Do you go home every day?" She replied, "Yes." "Have you done any business?" She replied, "Nonsense." The plaintiff's lawyer, Shen, asked Shen Meimei, "Did the defendant give you any letters?" She replied, "Yes, many. I only found two now," and presented them to the court. The defendant Zhong Xiaoqi testified that he met the plaintiff the year before last because she asked him to play mahjong. In September, he returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou and met the plaintiff on Zhifu Road. She asked where he was staying. Because he couldn't stay with his father, he was staying at the Pingqiao Hotel and told her. The next morning, she came to the hotel to chat. However, the plaintiff was a servant (ranked sixth) at the prostitute Qingfeng's place in Huile Lane from January of last year. After Mid-Autumn Festival, she was transferred to the prostitute Aiyue's place in Minhe Lane, also known as the sixth elder, which can be investigated. From January to May of last year, he stayed at the plaintiff's house several times. He also presented Zhang Furen, an employee of the Deli cigarette paper shop on Ningbo Road where the plaintiff currently lives, as a witness to prove the plaintiff's family's behavior. Zhang claimed that he was not the second landlord but was representing the second landlord to testify. Judge Xiao said that a witness cannot represent another, as they must bear criminal responsibility. Zhang then stated that since he could not represent another, he did not wish to testify. The defendant's lawyer then requested that Qingfeng and Aiyue be summoned to testify. The court ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for 2:00 PM on March 4th.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchant Chen Yunling Accused of Starting With Passion, Ending With Abandonment</h3>
<p>▲ Lived with Weng Jinying for Six or Seven Years</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly Abandoned Her Without Support</p>
<p>▲ Judge Xiao Considers the Human Aspect</p>
<p>▲ Advises Both Lawyers to Find a Way to Settle</p>
<p>Chen Yunling, a tea merchant from Guangdong, over fifty years old, was previously sued twice by a woman from the same hometown, Chen Weng (i.e., Jin Wengying), in the Special District Court for abandonment. Both times, the self-prosecution was rejected. It is now known that the woman's elder sister, Weng Guiying, has come forward and, with lawyers Yao Xian, Lu Qi, and Zhang Ding, filed a self-prosecution in the Special Court, accusing Chen Yunling of bigamy, using deception to make women believe they were in a marital relationship and committing adultery with them, and starting with passion but ending with abandonment, neglecting to provide support, and falsely accusing a good woman of being a prostitute, openly insulting her. The gist of the accusation is as follows: The accuser's younger sister, Chen Wengying, lost her mother at a young age and, because she was not welcome by her stepmother, was fostered with the accuser. In the summer of the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), the accused claimed to have lost his wife and sought to remarry, asking a matchmaker to speak to the accuser, wanting to marry her as his successor wife. The accuser agreed because Jinying was getting older and had many family troubles. They were married on the sixth day of the tenth month at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant in Zhonghongqiao. Later, they rented a house and lived together. On March 9th of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), a boy was born. The accused, initially lacking an heir, was overjoyed and named him Delai (now five years old). Later, when Jinying was socializing with relatives and friends, she discovered that the accused had not only not lost his wife but also had two concubines. Jinying initially wanted to seriously confront the accused, but the accuser still adhered to traditional ethics, believing that since Jinying had already married and had a child, it was better to stay with him until the end to avoid being ridiculed. Jinying, upon hearing this advice, could only lament her bad fate. Unexpectedly, the accused was naturally lustful. Seeing that Jinying was weak and could be bullied, he secretly hid another lover in a golden house, abandoning Jinying and her son like worn-out shoes, even cutting off their supplies and treating them like strangers. Although the accuser and Jinying repeatedly went to reason with him, the accused always avoided meeting them. The landlord, Li Xiaokun, feeling sympathy, spoke out on their behalf and demanded rent. Initially, he ignored them, but when they threatened to sue, he gave them a bank check. However, he still ignored Jinying's living expenses. Unable to do otherwise, last winter, Jinying filed a lawsuit. The accused, having lost all conscience, actually accused Jinying of being a local prostitute, falsely claiming she was a mistress and not a spouse, cruelly calling his own flesh and blood an unknown child, insulting them wantonly. Because of the legal restriction that spouses cannot self-prosecute, the case was rejected, leaving Jinying and her son helpless and without food, destined to die. The accused is a well-known tea merchant in Shanghai, wielding his power to abuse women. He is not only a public enemy of women but also intolerable to law and morality. The accuser, feeling a sense of obligation, cannot remain silent and therefore sues, requesting that the court order him to pay alimony and compensation of 50,000 yuan. The court approved the request and issued a summons, bringing Chen to the Third Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. Judge Xiao Xie-fen conducted the hearing, with the defendant represented by lawyer Jiang Rong. The hearing proceeded as follows: First, the defendant Chen Yunling was questioned. Chen stated he was fifty-one years old, from Guangdong, and worked as a runner in a tea company. Judge Xiao asked, "What is your relationship with Weng Jinying?" Chen replied, "A mistress." "When did it start, and for how many years?" Chen replied, "It started in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), for six or seven years." "You lived with her for six or seven years; do you still call her a mistress? According to Shanghai's common custom, a mistress is like a concubine. Do you know that?" Chen replied, "Although it was six or seven years, I only went there three times." "Do you know that the child you had with her is named Delai?" Chen replied, "The child is not mine, and I don't know if there is even a child." (At this time, Weng Jinying, in the plaintiff's area, frequently smiled bitterly.) Then, the accuser Weng Guiying was questioned. Weng stated she was thirty-five years old, from Guangdong, and recounted the previous events. Judge Xiao asked, "Are you suing on behalf of Weng Jinying or on your own behalf? If you are suing on behalf of her, it is not in accordance with the law, and this court will reject it. If you are suing on your own behalf, this court can accept it." She replied, "I am suing in my name because my sister cannot sue." Judge Xiao then asked Chen Yunling whether there was a marriage certificate or matchmaker for his marriage with Weng Jinying. Chen replied, "There was a marriage certificate, but it was taken by the defendant. The matchmakers were Liu A-san and Wang A-gou." "Are the matchmakers present today?" He replied, "Not yet, but Wang A-gou is the defendant's person." He then asked the defendant Wang A-gou to the witness stand. He stated he was a worker at Heji and a colleague of the defendant. Six or seven years ago, he accompanied the defendant to Weng Guiying's place in Xinchang Lane, Tianzhao Road, to play. He was not a matchmaker; Liu A-san (an old woman) was the pimp. Then, Weng Jinying was questioned. Weng brought the five-year-old boy Delai to the court and stated she was eight years old, from Guangdong, and lived in Lihongqiao. Judge Xiao asked, "Are you married to the defendant?" She replied, "Yes." "Who officiated the wedding?" She replied, "My elder sister." "Why not your parents?" She replied, "My mother is dead, and my father is in Guangdong, so my elder sister officiated." "How many matchmakers?" She replied, "Two, Liu A-san and Wang A-gou." "After the marriage, you had a son, who is now five years old." She pointed at the child while speaking. (The child was well-behaved and lively and lovely. Before, he fell asleep in his mother's arms, but now he is awake.) "Is there a marriage certificate?" She replied, "Yes." "How many copies?" She replied, "Each of us has one copy. Mine is hidden in a drawer, but it was taken away by Chen Yunling." At this point, Judge Xiao stated that regardless of the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, they have lived together for six or seven years and have such a well-behaved child. Without discussing the law, we should consider the human aspect. The court will reschedule the case to 2:00 PM on March 16th. During this period, both lawyers should advise their clients not to go to extremes and find a way to settle amicably. After saying this, he adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>The New-Style Vault of the Shanghai Bank</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the Press Was Invited for a Tour</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank is constructing a new building at the west end of its current location to expand. It includes a state-of-the-art vault, unprecedented in Shanghai. As Mr. Gordon, the engineer in charge of constructing the vault, is about to return to the United States, the bank invited reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers in the city to visit yesterday afternoon to see the vault's interior before the new building is fully furnished. Mr. Ou Weiguo, the assistant manager of the bank, and Mr. Zhuo Yongshi, the manager of the savings department, hosted the event. Engineer Gordon personally explained everything. The vault is located on the ground floor of the new building and occupies a considerable area. The entire project is being undertaken by the Old Jinxinglong Company. Construction has been underway for over three months and will be completed in another two or three months. The vault is entirely constructed of high-grade steel, with six impenetrable sides, fireproof, and easy to use. The entire vault occupies an area of approximately forty feet long and thirty-four feet wide. It contains five thousand boxes of varying sizes and capacities, selected according to the customer's needs. The vault door is particularly grand, weighing fifteen tons, twenty inches thick, and eighty inches and six feet in circumference. One can enter and exit at will without having to bend over. The boxes are located on all four walls, with a wide interior, so the air circulates, and there is no risk of suffocation. The lights on the ceiling are beautiful and practical. Turning south from the vault door, there is another small room that can store various important items. The vault door is equipped with two Yale locks and a time lock for opening and closing. The time lock has seventy-two hours of variation. Once set, the vault cannot be opened until the set time. The combination of the time lock and the numbers is even more infinitely variable. There is also a security vault door on the south wall of the vault, adjacent to the small room, shaped like a window. After opening the door, one person can crawl in. This security vault door is for emergencies if the main vault door fails. The door weighs three tons, which is less than the main door, but the equipment is the same. The vault is equipped with a telephone for security. This is the general situation of the vault. There are also two vaults for storing silver dollars on the underground floor, which are also nearing completion. The door equipment is roughly the same. The doors and vaults were made by the Herring Hall Marvin Safe Company of Hamilton, Ohio, USA, and Old Jinxinglong is its agent. After the tour, Mr. Zhuo and Mr. Ou led the guests to dinner at the Old Carlton Hotel, where they enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Bandits Who Repeatedly Committed Major Kidnappings Sentenced</h3>
<p>▲ Shi Jinde and Li Wenbin Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>▲ Xie Shusen and Hua Guibao Sentenced to Ten Years</p>
<p>The bandits Shi Jinde (i.e., Shi A-gen), Xie Shusen (also known as Sanguangchangmen Mao), and others repeatedly committed major crimes of kidnapping for ransom, robbery, and murder. For example, they kidnapped Xi Lusheng, a comprador of HSBC, and shot him to death because he resisted. They also kidnapped Zhang Shouyong's sons Xinglian and Hualian, the soy sauce king Zhang Zukang, and Ken Zai, the son of a bank manager Lou Xunru, and extorted countless ransoms. They also intercepted more than 40,000 yuan of preparation funds from the Four Banks, divided the loot, and fled. Last winter, detectives Wei Jinfu and Mao Yiwen of the Hongkou Police Department, along with detective Sun Defu, and others arrested them and several accomplices. After a thorough investigation, they were prosecuted in the Special District Court. After repeated hearings, the truth was clarified. Yesterday morning was the date of the sentencing. After Judge Feng Shide took his seat, he ordered the police to bring the bandits to the court and read out the main text of the judgment. Shi Jinde and Li Wenbin were sentenced to death. Xie Shusen and Hua Guibao were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Chen Zhijian was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Song Yaoming was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the determination of the trial shall be offset by two days for one day of imprisonment. Three pistols, twenty-seven bullets, a gramophone, a tape measure, two measuring instruments, a bicycle, and 19,300 yuan of loot obtained from the ransom were all confiscated. Xie A-tao, Guo A-liu, and Yu Xue-shi were all found not guilty. Fan Gang, the lawyer for Xie and others, requested immediate release because the police lawyer had stated that they had no objection to the acquittal of the defendants. Judge Feng immediately approved it. The others who were sentenced were taken away by the police to await execution after the determination of the sentence.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Allots 120,000 Yuan Monthly for Fujian Education</h3>
<p>The educational funding for Fujian Province has always been allocated by the Salt Affairs Audit Office of the province in addition to the salt surtax. The deficit was subsidized by the Finance Department. Because the salt tax was taken back by the Ministry of Finance for self-management, the educational funding of the province was in danger of fluctuation. The Fujian Provincial Department of Education recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to transfer to the Ministry of Finance the allocation of 140,000 yuan of educational funding to the province every month. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Ministry of Education, approving the allocation of 120,000 yuan of educational funding to the province every day after the salt tax was taken back. The Ministry of Education approved the reply and ordered the Fujian Provincial Department of Education to take note.</p>

<h3>Wang Jiyuan's Solo Exhibition in Paris Receives Acclaim</h3>
<p>(Paris Correspondence) The famous painter Wang Jiyuan went to Europe last spring. On January 1st of this year, he held a solo exhibition in Paris, the capital of France, to promote Eastern art. It has aroused considerable international attention and received favorable reviews from Parisian newspapers. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Paris (Comcedie) newspaper, Mr. Wanneau of "Fine Arts World," commented, "Wang Jiyuan is a famous painter from the East who has come to Paris to exhibit his Chinese paintings. I would like to solemnly declare that his Chinese paintings should not be confused with Japanese paintings."</p>
<p>"The characteristics and style of Chinese paintings do indeed contain a permanent and mysterious reservation. These characteristics and styles are unknown to the average Frenchman, especially modern Chinese paintings."</p>
<p>"Wang Jiyuan has given us an explanation on both points. His coming to Paris is not only to display his works in the White Willow China Gallery on Rue do Scine, but also has a more important mission: to integrate the strengths of Eastern and Western paintings and create a new art."</p>
<p>"What we should pay most attention to is that Wang Jiyuan is a home-grown artist with a special talent. The oil paintings and watercolors displayed in the White Willow China Gallery can explain to us how this talent was discovered."</p>
<p>"Look at his works, some of which carry the spirit of tradition. Most of them, such as "Flowers" and "Landscapes," all use a rich and solid tone to express a wonderful realm like their share. Everywhere, his active talent can be revealed. Wang Jiyuan's personal characteristics are all expressed. For example, in the landscape 丨West Lake丨, the sky and water are bright, and the waves and shadows cross the sky, showing magnificence in depression. In the flowers 丨A Bunch of Spring Flowers丨, there is silence in richness. His sketches, written with casual and attractive strokes, also express the extremely Chinese characteristics of this painter."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Charles Fegdal of the Paris Weekly (Charles Fegdal) commented, "The exhibition of the Chinese painter Wang Jiyuan is a very unique and interesting exhibition. The displayed oil paintings are good works that are meaningful to study and absorb European technology. We have found that he has applied the light and color of the Impressionists, the theory of the plein air painters, and the rigor of the constructivists. This is obvious. However, when Wang Jiyuan follows his Far Eastern character and his Asian way of observing and feeling, his inspiration and his personal style, his unique charm and his true moving point immediately appear before our eyes. Look at his landscape paintings, especially the watercolors. We are immediately seized by a strange and distant poetry, a homesickness for an imaginary and dreamlike location, and an eternal desire for travel. The paintings of Wang Jiyuan, this extremely talented Chinese artist, give us a good impression and are enough to travel outside the world."</p>
<p>The Paris English Daily 丨 Art World Section 丨 "The solo exhibition of the Chinese artist Wang Jiyuan can indeed arouse our great interest in this period of artistic silence. Wang's intelligence is truly as admirable as our admiration for the transcendence of Far Eastern art. It is also because he has been immersed in ancient culture. The Chinese landscapes and flowers, etc., he painted are all very good, and his watercolors are particularly wonderful. (January of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) in Paris)"</p>

<h3>Chinese Vocational Education Society Seeks Opinions for a Special Issue on Middle School Revolution</h3>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society sent a letter to educational experts yesterday seeking their opinions on the middle school system for the upcoming "Chinese Revolution No. 5." The letter stated that since various shortcomings have been found in the current middle school education, a thorough reform should be sought. Colleagues have been studying this for years, and although they have ideas, they dare not express their own opinions. Therefore, the society's monthly magazine will publish "Middle School Revolution No. 5" to solicit the opinions of comrades in order to find a satisfactory solution. A copy is enclosed for your review, and we hope you will contribute your great insights, write, or send them to the society on Guanglong Road, Shanghai. We will publish all the great articles from various parties in subsequent issues for comrades at home and abroad to explore. Furthermore, Japan issued a middle school reform order on January 10 of this year, stipulating that the first part of middle school should nurture knowledge or vocational skills to prepare for employment, and that the nature of the second part of general middle school should also emphasize vocationalization. This is indeed a major revolutionary event in their education system. We will translate and include this in the subsequent issue for reference. Colleagues are alarmed by the crises lurking everywhere, and in view of our neighboring country taking the lead, we are raising this important issue to arouse the attention of our countrymen. We have long admired your in-depth research and insightful thinking on education, and we are sure you will be happy to teach us.</p>

<h3>Chinese Football Team</h3>
<p>| Lineup Already Determined |</p>
<p>▲Friendly Match with Western Police on March 1st</p>
<p>| Jinghua and Hualing Both Penalized</p>
<p>The committee of the Chinese Football Association held a temporary meeting at the Deng Tuomo Hotel on Sichuan Road at 12:15 PM yesterday. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) The Jinghua team used an unregistered player (Fang Lesheng) in the match against England and the United States. This was reported by others and confirmed by the referee. The player also admitted to representing Jinghua in the competition, but the team still tried to cover it up. This is a serious violation of the association's regulations and sportsmanship. The team will be considered to have forfeited the match, and its qualification for this year's competition will be revoked. In the next year, the team must provide a solid guarantee and be approved by the association before it can rejoin the competition and participate in matches.</p>
<p>(2) Jia Changshun, a player from the Hualing B team, assaulted a player during the match.

<h3>Envoy from Western Hubei Games Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Liu Zhuxiang</p>
<p>Yichang is an important area in Western Hubei. Since the arrival of Guo Yizhi, brigade commander of the 2nd Independent Brigade of the 21st Sichuan Army, the security of the city has been very orderly. In addition to his official duties, Guo is most fond of sports. Seeing that sports in Western Hubei were not prosperous, he convened the first preparatory meeting for the Western Hubei Spring Games at the headquarters of the garrison command on January 17, inviting representatives from various agencies, legal entities, and schools. The preparatory committee was formally established, and the various departments have been very busy since then. As the Games are scheduled to open on April 1, which is not far away, the committee has specially dispatched Liu Zhuxiang to Shanghai to explore and purchase various equipment, tools, and prizes. It is reported that Mr. Liu arrived in Shanghai last night, the 23rd, by Jiangxin steamer.</p>

<h3>Transformation by Lu Yan</h3>
<p>Graduation from university: is it joy or sorrow? Shi Yi Jun can tell us.</p>
<p>Shi Yi was a top student at our school, an outstanding figure among us. Therefore, he was particularly confident. He believed that his future was bright and far-reaching, that with his talent he would be valued in society. His confidence was a motivation for him to study hard. Because of his excellent grades, his confidence was further strengthened. Therefore, teachers and students at the school respected and loved him.</p>
<p>Not only was his academic performance worthy of respect and love, but also his ability to handle affairs and his activity were admirable. He was an upright, honest, and courageous young man. When truth was before him, he never backed down. He relied on perseverance to argue for truth. When there were unreasonable things at the school, he shouted to mobilize all the students to resist. Therefore, many professors or staff members who were unfit for their positions had some fear of him. The principal sometimes had to win him over. So he was very proud and often said, "If I reflect and find that I am right, I will go forward even if there are thousands of people against me. If I reflect and find that I am wrong, I would not dare to even look at someone in rough clothes." In his use of ancient people's words as his own slogan, we can know that he was indeed a proud young man.</p>
<p>Last summer vacation, he graduated from our school. Before graduation, he was very happy, with a joyful face all day long. At the farewell banquet for his fellow villagers, he said, "From now on, I will start serving the society. The current society is so bad, but I will never bow my head to the bad society. This is what I think, and I hope that all of you fellow villagers will have the same idea."</p>
<p>When he wore the square hat and the black clothes with wide sleeves and received the diploma, he still had a smiling face and represented the graduating students to deliver the response speech, saying, "Today is a very memorable day. For all of you, it is the day of parting with us graduates. For us graduates, we will divide life into two parts, throw away the past school life, regard it as past achievements, and only recall it in memories. In the future, it will be the days for us to struggle in society. We will rely on what we have learned to experiment in society..."</p>
<p>Three days after the graduation ceremony, he was no longer as happy as before. He packed all the books he had read in three and a half years into boxes, but he was always unusually busy all day long. His work changed from writing articles to writing letters, from reading to deep thinking, from running and jumping on the sports field to running around on the road to officialdom. His life and work changed not long after graduation.</p>
<p>His face gradually changed from joy to sorrow, because he had been running around for a month and still had not found a satisfactory position. He began to feel somewhat disappointed and realized that what he had learned was not necessarily applicable.</p>
<p>He saw that it was very difficult to demand a satisfactory job. He was willing to compromise on things that could be compromised. But after another month, he still couldn't find even an unsatisfactory job. He began to panic, and his sorrow turned into suffering. He had to go to his teachers or principal to ask for help, and the teachers and principal's answer was, "If there is an opportunity, we will try to find a way for you."</p>
<p>One day, he came back from the principal's office, and he was so angry that his face turned red. He suffered the greatest humiliation in his life. In fact, this was just the beginning of his suffering.</p>
<p>He remembered that when he went to see the principal at school, the principal was always very polite. This day, he went to the principal, and he clearly saw the principal coming out of the car and walking into his mansion. Then he went to press the doorbell, and after the servant received his business card and reported it, the servant came out and replied that the principal was not in. He thought the servant was acting strangely, so he questioned him, "The principal just went in. I saw it with my own eyes. How can you be so unreasonable and play tricks?" The servant replied, "Sir, don't you understand? This is the principal's way of turning away guests." He smiled and went in. "Ah, this is the way of turning away guests." He walked away with suspicion and sighed. When he returned to the school, he was already soaked by the rain.</p>
<p>From then on, he no longer believed in the principal. He vowed never to ask him again.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and the summer vacation was spent running around, but he still hadn't found a job. He inquired about news everywhere, and the response was the same: "Now it's too late. We will try to find a way for you next year."</p>
<p>He became unemployed like this.</p>
<p>Although he was not married and had no family burden, his ancestors did not leave a large amount of property. His living expenses were indeed a problem. He was very anxious about this.</p>
<p>Because of the pressure of living expenses, he changed even more drastically.</p>
<p>When he asked his relatives and former teachers to write letters, they were unwilling to read or understand vernacular letters. To cater to their preferences, he had to change vernacular to classical Chinese. When he was a student, he strongly opposed classical Chinese and advocated vernacular. Now, not only did he have to use parallelism, but he also had to cite classical allusions. A letter was written on two eight-line note papers, and he had not even said the main point that should be said. He also made all the nouns wear ancient costumes, such as writing "world" as "universe," etc. He sometimes felt that this was wrong and ashamed, but vernacular was not understood by them. What could he do? He could only go backwards.</p>
<p>"I'm really ashamed. Today I have to surrender to others again." He heard that a professor who had been squeezed away by him had become the dean of a provincial university. Because he really had no way to go, he had no choice but to write a letter to him with an old face. He felt painful and sighed. In that letter, he wrote so many words that violated his conscience. However, he waited for more than a month and still did not receive a reply.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I really went against my conscience, I really lost my shame. Until now, I never expected that I would beg him." After he visited a famous local tyrant in his hometown, he felt deeply uneasy. He was very remorseful for saying so many things that should not have been said.</p>
<h3>Hard Marriage Proposal Causes Frostbite Trouble (Zhang Dabei)</h3>
<p>▲Poisoning, Heartbreak, Insomnia</p>
<p>Frostbite is a disease that people generally despise and are unwilling to treat. Although some people are afraid that the skin will break and bleed later, they are willing to pay a small price to buy medicine from the pharmacy. However, true and false prescriptions ultimately cannot achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, the News Daily Supplement recently published a report that someone suffered from poisoning and injury due to frostbite that had been festering for a long time and not healing. Also, in the mailbox column of "Life" Weekly, Volume 6, Issue 7, it was reported that Ms. Chen Yunyu suffered from frostbite that made it difficult to walk and hindered her work. After being cured by a doctor, the doctor insisted on proposing marriage, which led to a nervous breakdown and insomnia. There are many other cases that have not been reported in the newspapers. From this, it can be seen that there are many people who suffer from frostbite, and there are also many root causes of trouble. What a pity that they probably don't know that the "Frost Enemy Front" invented by the Keda Pharmacy at East Xinqiao, No. 6, Ma Road, Shanghai, is a miraculous medicine specifically for treating frostbite that has not festered. It can guarantee that the frostbite that has already occurred will not fester. This is the real situation, not intentionally exaggerated. Now, with 120% sincerity, I introduce this "Frost Enemy Front" to the readers. I also sincerely ask the readers to introduce this "Frost Enemy Front" to friends, relatives, and neighbors who have not read the newspaper, so that those who suffer from frostbite can apply this medicine and avoid festering, so as to avoid the misfortune of poisoning and injury and hard marriage proposals by doctors. If the frostbite has already festered, then you can use "Frost Enemy Back," a miraculous medicine specifically for treating festered frostbite. It can remove rot and generate new flesh, and it can heal within a limited number of days. Do not miss the opportunity and sit idly by.</p>
<p>Come, "You sir are a hero in our place, the parents of our place. Your sir's morality and articles are enough to be a model for our descendants. Your sir has a high reputation, and I wonder if you are willing to help this descendant..."</p>
<p>He has transformed, a huge transformation. Everyone is so surprised.</p>
<p>"Graduation from university is suffering, not joy." He continues to be unemployed, explaining himself like this and telling us like this.</p>

<h3>Poet Meng Yin</h3>
<p>Since two weeks ago, the poet Sha Bing received a beautiful, water-red envelope in his mailbox at the gatehouse, his melancholy, distressed face now often showed a smug smile.</p>
<p>This was truly a mysterious and strange thing. All the students living in Nanming University knew Sha Bing as a famous decadent poet. All those who enjoyed reading the Da Ming Monthly also knew him as a famous decadent poet. Indeed, Sha Bing was a decadent poet. This was not only the feeling of classmates who knew him and readers who had read his works, but also the feeling of an ignorant stranger. Because from his unkempt clothes, disheveled long hair, thin figure, haggard face, and his frequent sighs, tears, and madman-like actions, he looked like a neurotic.</p>
<p>However, recently this famous poet was different. His melancholy face now showed a happy smile. Outwardly, his former unkempt clothes and disheveled hair had naturally changed. The unkempt became neat, the disheveled became smooth. Even his inner outlook on life was different. Previously, he was pessimistic, negative, degenerate, and decadent… now he was optimistic, positive, upward, forward, and loving life. This we can see from the transformation of his works, from "Melancholy Songs," "The Loser," "Die, My Heart," to "Ode to Life," "March"… a kind of ardent emotion. As for crying and sighing, they were even rarer. Because inner joy and happiness made him aware of the importance of taking care of his body. Now his skin and face were those of a young man saturated with the blood of youth.</p>
<p>Therefore, the students of Nanming University and the readers of Da Ming Monthly were all spreading rumors about the extremely different transformation of the poet Sha Bing in his actions and works, believing it to be mysterious and strange, leaving those who liked gossip unable to understand it.</p>
<p>It is said that genius poets, their actions are mysterious and strange, naturally different from ordinary people, like Li Bai jumping into the water to catch the moon, and Niger using stones as cakes. Sha Bing's temperament changed so drastically in just half a month, roughly of the same kind. So, a large part of the people who cared about the poet Sha Bing believed that his recent change in temperament was due to the mysterious and strange nature of the poet himself. This is probably correct.</p>
<p>The sun slowly slanted westward, like a wheel towering high on the top of the Western Hills. A touch of golden light shimmered on the earth, especially in the campus of Nanming University. At this time, it was truly beautiful. The pond water reflected the sunlight, the breeze blew, and ripples appeared on the surface of the pond. The verdant branches issued rustling songs. The poet Sha Bing sat on the grass by the pond, holding a torn, beautiful water-red envelope in his hand. A piece of stationery fell on his lap. This letter was the one he had just taken from the mailbox at the gatehouse, a letter written to him by a Ms. Qianying, congratulating him on being a genius poet. After reading it, his heart was jumping, his blood was rushing, and finally, it made his crying face smile.</p>
<p>From that day on, the poet Sha Bing went to the mailbox at the gatehouse every day to get letters (naturally, sometimes he didn't get any), read letters in the campus every day, and wrote letters in the dormitory every day. Also, from that day on, the poet Sha Bing changed his outlook on life and changed his artistic view, causing most of the people who knew him to suspect him, and therefore some said it was due to the mysterious and strange nature of the poet.</p>
<p>Here, we should not blame the poet Sha Bing for being so confused or say that he was too unworthy, causing him to go crazy like this for a woman. Originally, he was twenty-five years old this year and had not yet found a lover. Is it possible to become a poet without a lover? Because whether in life or in works, a lover is really important to a poet, especially since Sha Bing is twenty-five years old this year. Therefore, the poet Sha Bing often sighed, resenting that the women of the world were too blind, leaving such an affectionate poet unloved, and going to love ordinary vulgar things. If we say that the poet Sha Bing's previous pessimism, degeneration, and madman-like mind were entirely due to the lack of a woman's comfort, it is not an exaggeration. And now that he is happy and cheerful because he received a woman's letter, it is also natural. It is only pitiful for those who do not know the heart of the poet Sha Bing, insisting on using many irrelevant legends to speculate about him, it is truly unjust.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the poet Sha Bing was sitting in the campus again, also reading the letter he had just taken from the mailbox at the gatehouse. Just as he was reading with great interest, suddenly two classmates stood in front of him.</p>
<p>"Hey, Poet Sha, what are you looking at, so</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>enthusiastically?"</p>
<p>"Oh," the poet was startled and looked up. Seeing that it was Zhang and Wang, who were famous throughout the school for their love of joking, he quickly said,</p>
<p>"Nothing, reading my own work."</p>
<p>"Your own work?" Wang said, pointing to the red envelope that had fallen on the ground, "Clearly you are reading a letter, look, isn't this an envelope?"</p>
<p>"Haha, love letter, love letter, let's take a look at it publicly," Zhang pulled the poet Sha Bing's hand.</p>
<p>The poet's face turned red. He couldn't lie and quickly said, "Don't look at the letter, it's the same as me telling you." So, the poet told them the whole story, how fluent and affectionate this woman wrote, and how well she understood his personality and works. Finally, he said,</p>
<p>"It's just that we haven't met yet, alas, what a pity..."</p>
<p>"Do you want to meet her?" Wang casually said.</p>
<p>"Of course, but I haven't written to discuss it with her."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll call her to meet you," Zhang said generously.</p>
<p>The poet was about to ask Zhang if he knew her, but the two of them walked away as if they couldn't help laughing.</p>
<p>The next day, the poet really received a letter from her, inviting him to meet at Samsung Garden, the time being "6 pm this afternoon." This really made the poet Sha Bing extremely happy, almost unprecedented. After the class was over, the poet hurriedly walked back to the dormitory, changed into a suit, put on shiny shoes, and combed his hair. While doing these unusual actions, many classmates threw countless strange and mysterious glances at him.</p>
<p>"Poet Sha, what are you busy with?" A classmate surnamed Li asked.</p>
<p>"Hum, hum," the poet had no intention of answering, only hummed twice. So, this uninvited Li said,</p>
<p>"Mysterious, mysterious, third is still mysterious."</p>
<p>The other classmates also said, "Is this kind of behavior a poet?" They seemed to doubt all other poets because of the strange attitude of the poet Sha Bing. However, the poet Sha Bing had no intention of paying attention to these issues.</p>
<p>Busy sweating profusely, he finally managed to tie his tie, put on his suit, combed his hair smoothly, and looked in the mirror again, thinking he was very satisfied. Then he took his manuscript of recent works (this was to be given to his lover as a meeting gift, because this work was a product of his transformation, singing the praise of the god of love) and left the school gate. Before leaving the school, he also looked for Wang and Zhang, intending to ask them if they knew his lover... but a classmate surnamed Chen told him that Wang and Zhang had already gone out.</p>
<p>On the way, the poet thought about many questions. He thought about how to address her when they first met, whether to call her Miss or directly call her lover. He wondered what kind of woman she was, whether she was beautiful or not, whether she suited his taste. He also thought about… thought about a lot, he himself couldn't remember clearly.</p>
<p>Precisely at six o'clock, he walked into Samsung Park. In a small pavilion, Zhang first called him,</p>
<p>"Poet Sha, come here." He looked towards the pavilion upon hearing the sound and saw Zhang, and next to him sat a woman wearing a red cheongsam. The poet's heart jumped, and he quickly walked into the pavilion.</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting," the poet walked into the pavilion and gave a sixty-degree bow. He saw that the woman had her back to him and didn't move. For the sake of self-esteem, the poet couldn't help but hate his lover, but then he forgave her, "Maybe she's shy…"</p>
<p>"(Let me introduce, this is the poet Sha Bing whom you admire, this is the lover who wrote to you…)" Zhang reached out to pull the woman, but couldn't help laughing himself. And the woman also laughed heartily, she turned around and said in a coquettish voice, "Poet Sha, my dearest…"</p>
<p>The poet Sha Bing collapsed in the pavilion in anger, he slowly said like humming a poem,</p>
<p>"I really don't know why you want to tease me like this."</p>
<p>It turned out that the woman who often signed the letters to the poet was a prank by Zhang and Wang. Today, Wang was also disguised as a woman.</p>
<p>From then on, the poet Sha Bing returned to his former attitude. The students of Nanming and the readers of Da Ming Monthly often the poet's mystery and strange</p>
