<h3 id="c24">抗日救國運動中官吏之責任 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>國至今日已危如絲屬内苦洚水外迫强敵山河破碎民命塗炭地大物博民衆一旦奮起即足以震撼全球之大國。今竟淪於危如纍卵。朝不保夕之嚴重情勢中。此種惡果。吾人不能否認爲二十年來不良政治所造成。　　過往之二十年政治上之不良現象。歷歷陳列於吾人眼。前初不必述。亦不暇述。蓋吾人所要求者。在從今日起之未來而不在於算舊賬「悟往者之不可諫。知來者之猶可追。」在國難臨頭之今日。全國官吏。應有此沉痛之覺悟。虔誠自贖。自贖之道爲何。</p>
<p>第一應認清本身所處之地位。國號民國。主權在民。在職官吏。皆爲民僕。應時時爲全體民衆而服務。爲整個國家而服務。憑藉地位。奴隷人民。荒廢職守。即爲辜負人民之付託。違反人民之公意。故自今日起。我在職官吏。應切實自承其公僕之地位。奉公守法。尊重人民之意志。從事政治上之設施。　　第二應認清自己之能力。用盡其才。才亦應當其用。今日政治界之現象。長於理化者或從事司法。長於敎育者或從事外交。所用所學。兩不相稱。誤國負民。此爲政治不能步上軌道之最大癥結。自今起。人人應以國事爲前提。勿以做官爲職業勿以做官爲獵取利祿之階梯。盡我所能。辭我所不稱。不尸位素餐。不因循敷衍從政者皆爲專家。政治自能日即於進步。</p>
<p>第三應不兼職。今之從政者。地位愈高。兼職愈多。或掛虚銜。更或遙領。夫人非天縱。孰能兼長。而且個人之精力有限。孰能兼而不顧。爲負國。顧而無成。亦爲誤國。或者以爲兼職不兼薪。即可減少流弊此則僅能抑制兼職鶩利之貪慾。而不能減少負國誤國之實害。自今日起。從政者宜瘁心力於一事。。大開政治之門。延攬才智之士。俾才能盡用。用能裨國</p>
<p>第四應不貪錢。岳武穆有言。「文官不愛錢武官不怕死而天下太平矣」目前民瘦官肥。民苦飢寒。官耽逸樂。實爲無可掩飾之事實。惟貪錢故私慾掩其公心。故爭端多。故政治無法澄清。故國愈混亂。民愈塗炭。自念日起。從政者應廉潔自矢。從個人廉潔。以建立廉潔之政府。亦惟廉潔之政府。乃能爲人民所擁護愛戴之政府。乃有穩固之根基。</p>
<p>抗日救國徒空口號嘯。痛哭流涙。終無補於實際。舉國上下。於今茲千鈞一髮之際以虔誠之悔悟。努力於自振自贖。固何有於目前之外患與内憂。否則漫漫長夜。國家前途。眞未可測。在今日危急存亡之秋。吾人所希望於全國官吏者如斯而已。如斯而已。</p>

<p>區域及形勢威海位於山東半島之東北、其經度爲一百二十二度東十分、緯度爲三十度北十分、扼渤海之口、與旅順南北對峙、形勢險要、並爲海防重鎭、其地東臨黃海、三面環山、峯巒綿互、東駛入海、夾拱港口、適成蟹鉗形、劉公島巍峙中流、分港口爲二、東口闊一英里半、其間一嶼曰日島、水深三四尋、西口闊四分之三英里、水深十一二尋、能通巨艦、灣内東西四海里、南北五海里、吃水極深、錨位極多、外有劉公島之屏障、輪舶出入便利、遇霧風時、停泊安全、終年不凍、實一天然良港也、就軍事方面言、按照著名海軍兵家美國默罕將軍所論軍港地形要素、則缺點尙多、如陸地交通不便、森林太少、軍艦藏護不周、出產糧食太少、口内太小操練不便等項、頗有考慮餘地、惟我國北方沿海港灣、可作海軍根據地者、屈指寥寥、苟能力加經營、開發土地、振興商務、敷設鐵道、則脈絡貫通、形勢不孤、北與旅大相犄角、仍不失爲海防重地北方屏障也、</p>
<p>威海自經我國收回設置管理公署、其行政區域、一爲英國原租借地、一爲舊威海衛城、計共面積約三百方英里、小於香港者僅九十餘方英里、東西綿延二十六英里、南北十八英里、大别之可分爲三部、一爲碼頭區、即商埠所在、次爲劉公島區、再次爲鄕區、至舊城區範圍極小、周不過六里、向歸文登縣管轄、自接收後、始劃歸威海行政區、以其三面與商埠毘連、近更拆除城門、建築馬路、已呵成一氣、不復有畛域之分、</p>
<p>沿革威海爲前漢不夜縣、地屬東萊郡、自明洪武設衛、駐兵以防海寇、至清光緒十四年定爲軍港、設北洋水師提督署於劉公島、以統轄海軍、並於黃島鹿角嘴等處建築砲台、以資防守、光緒二十年甲午清與日本宣戰、海軍戰於黃海不利、僅鎭遠定遠二艦歸劉公島、日陸軍由榮城灣登陸、佔領對岸各地、海軍則封鎖威海口外、糧盡援絶、海軍提督丁汝昌仰藥死、於是威海衛乃淪於日軍之手、光緒二十一年、中日和約成立、割台灣曁遼東半島於日本、俄德出而抗言、索回遼東半島俄藉此要挾租借旅大、迨二十四年英人藉口均勢、租借威海、是年五月十三日租約成立、凡威海全灣沿岸十英里以内之地及劉公島悉以畀之、自此威海之受治於英人者、凡三十二年、直至民國十九年十月一日始得正式收回、重入版圖氣候威海氣候宜人、大地明凈、夏日乾爽、而不覺奥鵱、朝暮海風吹拂、更見雋爽、每届夏季、西人之來此避暑者、爲數殊多、公認爲中國沿海氣候最佳地點、平均雨水爲二十七寸、惟本年則不然、洪水爲災、遍於全國、威埠亦未能獲免、八月二十七日及九月五日兩次大風雨、均達八寸以上、當時狂潮猛漲、四山之水急流而下、平地水深三四尺、市肆列廛盡成澤國、家具什物飄流海面、兩次大水均歷數小時始退、農產商貨之受損、道路之毁壞、大略計之、約在百萬元以上、其詳細數目、尙待調查、惟此種非常之災變、自開埠以來罕所聞見、若論威埠通常之氣候、則固以優良見稱也、</p>
<p>物產威海物產以農產品爲大宗、如麥荳高梁之類、而以花生爲最主要產物、地方財賦半賴於此、出口貨物亦以此爲大宗、本年春鄕民收穫殊豐、爲十數年來所未有、方慶豐年、而水災已不旋踵而至、秋季歉收、勢所不免、花生產量亦必大見短絀、其影響於地方經濟殊不在少、其次爲漁業每年產額九百餘萬斤、價值約三十七萬元、大都運銷香港上海等處、近數年來自引用汽機漁輪、該業益見發展、惟有多種魚類因鹹製不得其法、以廉價售出、倘能採用新式製權及冷藏法則獲利之豐、可操左券、威海本漁鹽之區、故其鹽產亦殊豐、除當地自用者外、出口之數、約佔總產額百分之七十、大抵以朝鮮日本爲尾閭、惟每年出口確數、視市價之漲落、供求之情形、而年有不同、其出口最多之年、爲一千九百二十三年、計達七十二萬四千餘擔、鹽塲面積、在已往三十年間、增加甚鉅、現已達六千餘畝、惟本年以水災之影響、其損失當不在少、威海於蠶桑之利、亦已有相當發展、山顛水涯遍植野桑、計其面積可六十萬畝、所產之野蠶繭、以資本缺乏、不能設立絲廠、故大都運赴烟台、繅絲紡織、即著外之山東府綢所由成也、其次如花邊繡品、亦爲威海特產、中外客旅都採購、以貽親友、現有規模較大之工廠二十餘處、雇用女工爲數綦多、亦女子職業之一種也、</p>
<p>人民威海管理區域全區戶口、據最近調查、計共十八萬九千八百零一人、其中業農者九萬零八百四十五人、業商者八千二百八十三人、業漁者二千六百九十二人、業工者八千四百十五人、學界五百七十三人、其他雜業五百七十九人、無職業者計共一萬五千五百二十人、</p>
<p>居民淳樸耐勞、勤於所業、絶無儇薄狡獪之風、惟承英人愚民政策之後、以致風氣閉塞、智能低下、缺乏進取心、徒知事於隴畝、苟求温飽、自收回以來、經當局改善風氣、啓迪民智、較前已煥然改觀、管理組織威海租與英國、凡三十二年、一旦收回、在政治上經濟上有特殊情形、</p>

<p>按諸國府新頒布市組織法、適合第二欵第三項之規定、應得設市、直隸於行政院、外交部以茲事體大、召集有關係各部、如内政海軍財政交通各部部長、審查接收後管理問題、議决有三種辦法、（甲）如中央决定威海收回後立即作爲軍港、則一切設施、自當依照軍事計劃辦理、（乙）如因外交財政或其他問題、威海收回後、暫時不能作爲軍港、則在過渡期間可由中央特派專員以治理之、（丙）如第（乙）項辦法於行政系統上認爲未妥、則惟有遵照國府新頒市組織法第二條第三項之規定、設立直隷於行政院之市、其用人組織、力求簡節、以資治理而圖發展、以上議决案呈行政院後、經國務會議决、定威海衛列作軍港、在軍港未成立以前、設立管理公署、簡派專員以治理之、此威海不設市設立管理公署之原來也、其組織條例原至簡單、屢經試辦、窒礙良多、嗣經呈奉行政院核准修正、已稍稍擴充矣、治安問題威海華洋雜處、輪蹄交錯、治安方面賴東北海軍陸戰隊之鎭懾、與公安局長警之努力、地方安輯、有夜不閉戶之譽、一年以來、閭閻安堵、鷄犬無驚、市無游惰、道無丐者、故移家僦居者、日見其衆、軍警捍衛之責、不可没也、</p>
<h3 id="c98">建設事項 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>威海負山環海、地處衝要、海上交通、爲津滬班輪所必經、常川駐泊、尙稱便利、面積三千方華里、戶口二十萬、山林漁鹽之利、未盡啓發、人民樸實、工價低廉、苟能善加經營、不難蔚爲巨埠、昔當英人治理之時、對於地方建設、雖不無相當成績、　因絀於經費、因陋就簡之處、正不在少、蓋開埠之初、商業蕭條、税收殊徵、而英政府補助之欵、年不遇萬鎊、迨一千九百二十三年、收支差可相抵、英政府即停止補助、較諸　之經營膠澳、日俄之訊營大連、其建設成績、相去不可以道里計、而地方亦遂呈半發展狀態、最近八九年内、英人以業經聲明歸還、此土終非吾有、一切施政、僅在維持現狀、地方建設、更非所顧問、即如路政一項、其三十二年間所築之馬路、不過五十二英里、其除可以概見、自經我國接收、當局者積極進行、雖財政狀况、極端困難、而擘劃籌措、未嘗中輟、期年之中、馬路之新建者、達十英里、鄕道之修築者、計八百餘里、以較英人、應無愧色、茲擇共犖犖大者、略述如左、</p>
<p>興建城區馬路威海城區居奈姑山之麓、舊歸文登縣管轄、自接收後、始劃歸威海行政區、其城三面與商埠毘連、地處衝要、惟以街道崎嶇、高下不平、中闢巨溝、闊五六尺、以洩山水、車馬不能通行、以是市肆頽唐、景物蕭條、一門之隔、幾同天限、本年春、經公署測量設計預算、招標興修新式馬路、仍沿舊線以通四門、路寛二十七尺、兩旁水溝深寛自一尺半至二尺、刻已將次竣工、自此與商埠呵成一氣、等量發展、再者舊街闊度已足敷用、故因障礙路線而拆讓之房屋、不過數家、且賠償地價、津貼撫恤、幾等於拆去房地之價、此尤威埠人士所歌頌不止者、</p>
<p>修築鄕道威海行政區内、共有三百七十餘村、道路狹窄、每值陰雨、泥濘塞途、各村與商埠往來異常阻滯、遂由公署召集各區村董會商、利用春初農暇、由各村自動招集民夫、供給器具、按照公署所定計劃章程、分段修築、計完成闊十二尺之總路三百九十五里餘、闊八尺之支路一百七十二里半、闊六尺之村路二百三十四里餘、合共八百零二里、其涵洞橋梁、則由公署招標興築、崎嶇小徑、悉成康莊坦途、行旅稱便、</p>
<p>建築收回威海紀念塔威海租偕於英三十二年、始獲交還、不特樹中華民國收回租借地之先聲、且爲我中華民族所當慶祝者也、管理公署有鑒於此、爰於威海市區中心鯨園（舊名塢口花園）丙、築塔紀念、喚起民衆注意、塔身勒收回威海記、及交收專約、並載三民主義、塔高三十二尺、表示租借與英之年數、俾威人及游威者過此、於歡欣之餘、更惕然警罹、其寓意頗深遠矣、</p>
<p>重修環翠樓威海西城樓折北數百步、有一高岡、爲奈古山之麓、岡下阡陌環抱、形若拱衛、氣勢雄壯、形勝甲東海、環翠樓即踞共巔登其上、遠眺東海、近覽全衛、樓成於明宏治二年、年久失修、墻垣頽裂、窗戶毁損、若不設法修葺、則數百年之勝景、難以保存、管理公署召集地方人士、共商重修、衆意僉同、招標興修、樓之深廣各三十七尺、高三十尺、分爲二層、飛　聳閣、純係我國建築式、樓上下各爲一廣間、敷設椅座、爲游人休憩之所、岡下佈置亭園林木、實爲威海勝地、建設海水浴房海水浴有益衛生、人所共知、威海地臨海濱、夏季海水浴最爲相宜、惟居民隨地海浴、不特袒胸裸背、有碍觀瞻、且易發生危險、管理公署有鑒於此、於新碼頭之北、建設海水浴房二十二間、該處海底平坦、該房分爲四幢、後幢相距十尺、間闊約四尺、深約六尺、高約八尺、可容二人更　、大者四間、面積倍之、房頂蓋白鐵油以水綠色各間、均有木凳擱板衣钩等、設備周至、裨益居民及中外避暑士女、非淺鮮矣、</p>
<p>以上所述、僅其犖犖大者、此外如修理碼頭、翻修原有馬路、以及測勘冶口路綫計劃、建築民衆大禮堂、在經濟困難狀况之下、時期僅一年、對於建設事業、仍慘淡經營、非有熱心毅力、曷克臻此、預計明年今日、建設上之成績、當更斐然可觀矣</p>
<h3 id="c99">財政概略 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>地方税收鋭減之原因威海在英管時代、爲發展商業計、特闢爲自由貿易港、不收關税、以是商買雲集、貿易稱盛、税收漸增、年達五六十萬元、上年我國接收後、中央規定不作爲無税口岸、以符贓税平均及財政統一原則、如海關鹽務印花烟酒捲烟等機關、次第設立、人民擔負　增、物價昻貴、而各埠商賣、向以威埠無税而來者、亦相率他去、以是商務驟衰、地方收入、因以鋭减、此自然之趨勢、無右避免者、</p>
<p>財政之困難地方税收項下、計房捐地丁碼頭費牌照捐等、年約二十萬元、而支出各欵、經中央核准者、年需三十九萬除元、不敷之數、由國庫項下按月補助萬數千元、以資維持、惟值此訓政時期、地方建設、最關重要、築路興建、動需鉅欵、他如籌備自治、刷新敎育、社會救濟、黨務考試等項、需要費亦鉅、以是財政狀况、萬分竭蹶、查中央在税收、幾佔全部收入百分之七十、所望能於月助之欵、增加額數、按時照撥、俾此國土得光之威海、得以積極建設、臻於上理也、</p>
<p>政費之支配政費之困難、旣如上述、不得已竭力撙節、以資挹注、惟公署事務之繁重、與市府相彷彿、而用人則極爲簡單、其階級係就官吏俸給之最低者規定之、故全部職員之俸給、及警役之工餉、僅佔地方支出百分之四九九、英管時代用人及警額較少、而支出佔百分之五一九、其次公共工程佔百分之一九三、敎育佔百分之五四、醫藥衢生佔百分之二六、其他一切佔百分之二三八、自十九年十月起、至二十年六月止、共九個月、總支出連城區築路經費、計共二十九萬餘元、按之中央核准之預算、尙未超過、</p>

<p>威海在三十餘年前、一荒凉漁村耳、英人租借後、其最前二十年間、商業蕭條、收入稀少、因將威埠闢爲自由貿易港、商貨不納關税、祇收船鈔百分之一、最近十年間、商務以次發達、接收後海關及國税機關應有儘有、商人眼光淺、近各種事業、反形低落、不籌發展、奚以挽救、昔孔子適衛、因庶而富、管仲治齊、官山府海、威海夙擅魚鹽之利、近又戶口號稱二十萬、因勢利導、厥有數端、</p>
<p>一建築碼頭英管時代、曾鑒於往來輪船無可靠碼頭、每遇風雨黑夜、搭客上下及貨物起卸、均感不便、聘請有名工程師親自測勘、并籌收浪壩捐以充經費、嗣因需欵甚鉅、浪壩捐爲數至微、兼以行將交還、因而擱起、接收後自應提前建築、以利水上交通、據管理公署最近規劃、以將來威海市中心區、必在塢口南大操場附近建築新碼頭、現雖無力舉辦、至少限度、必須就原有寛二十尺之西碼頭、巡長入海約一百八十餘尺深處、遇落潮時水位低淺、亦可停泊一千噸船隻、此則一權宜辦法、非一勞永逸計也、</p>
<p>一建築市房及旅館威海風景宜人、終年無霧、遠出青島烟台之上、洵爲住家及避暑之良好地方、英管時代、每届春夏之交、英國軍艦及各國男女人士、源源而來、已成習慣、接收以後、添築水浴場板房二十六間、并整理東山公園、中外士女來威者較多、原有之東大樓東海飯店、苦難空納、加以市面繁盛、市民加增、亦有屋少人滿之感、現在官地尙多、地方人民擬照章具領、分别建築市房旅館、用以便利市民客民、一轉瞬間、昨市十倍、可操左券、</p>
<p>一建築自來水工廠商務發達地方、華洋雜處、飮料首當注重、英租威海期間、衣以水源難覓、依然鑿井取水、三十年來、未及興辦自來水、接收後、地方政府對於衛生設備、期臻完美、深以井水味澀、不合衛生之用、提議由官商合辦一自來水工廠、現正集合資本選擇水源中、倘能成爲事實、不但此種營業可獲厚利、即地方人士、中外來寳之駐威者、受賜多多矣、殊與市政衛生上大有裨益、</p>
<p>一漁航輪機用品製造廠威海魚類、以黃花魚大網魚爲大宗、每年本埠漁船約三四百艘、外來漁船約三百艘、率皆沿用舊式、不能與機輪抗衡、故權利均爲外人所　奪、現雖亟思抵劇、一切魚航汽油機械以及各種漁業用具、双皆收諸舶來品、在我祗得少數利益、大權仍然操諸外人、得不償失、究非善策、最好遴派漁業專門人員、精密調查、籌辦漁航輪機用品製造廠、一面振興水產事業、一面挽回曁失利權、海國生活、實利賴之、</p>
<p>一創辦冷藏事業及罐頭廠威海生活程度不高、水上出品無論已、即尋常家禽䐁牛鷄鴨、其價目比任何市府爲廉、前當英管期内、英商以大利所在、屢欲創設此種工廠、嗣因交還期近、未及舉辦、收回後、地方政府鋭意興辦各種新事業、假定一轉瞬間、碼頭築成、漁業發展、不籌一出銷妥法、末由得特殊利益、倘能由地方當局與本地富商、通力合作、俾一切鮮貨及罐頭物品、推銷及遠、殊與市府税收、市民經濟、兩有裨補、</p>
<p>一改製精鹽威海產鹽最富、爲威埠出產品之一、全埠鹽田、約計五千六百畝、據一九二六年報告、產鹽量約計一九五、一九餘擔、其銷路以香港高麗日本爲最多、運入内地者、除私運外爲數寥寥、良由本埠製造不良、因而内地銷路不暢、最近國内資本家實業家、先後來威、調查鹽田鹽灘與註山費產鹽費、以及鹽質鹽味等等、準備在威試辦精鹽公司以以資提倡、倘能早日告成、威埠不難成一大鹽場、拭目俟之、</p>
<p>一添設療養院威海氣候適宜、凡各種老年殘廢及肺癆病精神病來此療養者、絡繹不絶、收回以後、碼頭區設有公立醫院一所、劉公島温泉湯各設分院一所、設備均極完備、現由管理公署按照條約規定、聘用外籍醫師一人、并勘定劉公島地方、建築療養院、利用原有醫師、擔任醫務、正在籌備進行中、異日告成、吾知中外人土來威治潦者必不在少、殊與病人及市政兩有裨益、</p>
<p>一改良蠶桑及菓樹威海產繭極富、銷路亦廣、惟山蠶體大絲粗舊習慣均放置柞樹上、任其自由眠食、繅絲時、又無科學方法、故難與人競爭、亟宜派員赴東南各省、研究飼養栽桑各種新法、歸而設立較大工廠、以資模範、再烟威密邇、氣候土質、不相上下、烟台蘋果葡萄及其他水菓、每年輸出甚多、獲利極大、威海適得其反、殊所不解、現聞管理公署由公欵項下、借給種樹家低息資本、俟有利後、分别攤還、一面勸遵人民自動動集資、擴充無數園林、用助公家力量之不逮、語云、十年樹木、亦致富之一端也、</p>
<p>一花邊繡花工廠威海花邊繡花、向稱暢旺、大小工廠、不下十數處、每年運銷外洋、不在少數、惜規模狹小、管理指導、不甚合法、亟應選派精於手工人員、參考外人必需用品、一面翻新花様、迎合潮流、籌設工廠、特别改良、以期擴充銷路而闢利源、</p>
<p>一籌設國貨陳列館及國貨商塲威海當英管期内、爲無税口岸、洋貨輸進、自不待言、收回以後、爲抵制外貨提倡國貨起見、已由管理公署公佈徵求各省國貨陳列規則、并擇地籌設國貨商塲一所、任人觀覽、此後外人經商及海軍避暑來此者、參觀商塲陳列物品、選擇購買、旣可暢銷國貨、并可活動金融、</p>
<p>一籌設地方銀行及發行地方公債　者威海濫發紙幣、漫無限制、收回後經公署嚴加取締、由交通銀行中國實業銀行活動市面、信用昭著、惟地方應行發展事項、旣如前所列舉、無米終難爲炊、應由地方政府、籌集大宗資本、呈准設立地方銀行、專辦發展地方事業、遇必要時、亦得援照各省市政府成案、呈請發行地方公債、以資週轉、集合地方欵項、發揮地方業務、當亦中央政府所樂與贊成也、</p>
<p>以上臚列各條、均根據事實、凡關於租借前之歷史、接收時之經過、管理後之工作、分别事實與計劃、記述不鶩高遠、不尙空談、當爲留心新收回租借地如威海者所樂聞也、</p>

<p>親愛的國人。昨天我不是曾説我們對日的不抵抗主　　義似乎乎仿傚印度的非武力抵抗麽。誰知有一位印度朋友見了。却來對我提出抗議。説「我們的度的非武力抵抗實在是在甘地先生領導之下作有力量的抵抗。不過不用武力的方式罷了。而如今貴國的不抵抗主義。却實實在在是束手受侮絶不抵。抗如何能與我們的非武力抵抗相提並論。若是照這様不抵抗下去而没有其　有力量的禦敵方法那麽貴國要做印度第二。恐怕還夠不上咧。」我連忙向他道歉。一面忍痛寫出來。請大家平心靜氣的想想</p>

<p>入水。雙手挾其愛犬兩頭。故得不沉。浮於海面。並將望遠鏡窺察中日軍艦之沉没。旣而又回首望本國之中軍大旗。希來援救是時日本艦隊在鴨綠江中中軍艦已覆没士卒無人統領。行將挿白旗而宣佈免戰。在此時期。日軍在瞭望臺見中國軍艦並未前進。乃將大砲望準中軍大師旗轟擊。中軍旗中彈而折。海軍提督丁汝昌大驚失措。未將中軍旗重行豎起。於是兩翼軍艦。見中軍旗已倒。共相逃亡。而韓螶　在水中。亦因不見中軍旗。以爲中國軍艦。盡被擊敗。乃舍其兩愛犬。入水而死。當是時也。中國海軍。若均有韓世昌之忠勇。則日軍必敗北無欵。乃方伯謙及洋將漢納根先後逃遁丁汝昌胸無成竹。卒爲日本軍艦包圍。丁亦在劉公島服毒自殺以殉國。中國之海陸。軍至此乃一敗塗地。脱是役而中國不敗。則日人之在今日。必不敢小視中國也。</p>

<p>我們中國危急的　。耗一天比一天更嚴重了。翻閲報章。幾乎不忍卒讀。僨慨激昻的情緒。　　滿腔沸騰的熱血。連自己也不能指示它發洩的出路。當我舉起筆來的時候。手急午震顫了。想發表一些意見。思來索去。彷彿一部廿四史。不知從何説起。在這個國家存亡。民族生死的關頭。一部分醉生夢死的民衆。害國好亂的軍人。簸弄是非的政客。如今都已覺悟了。雖然過去的一切不忍再回憶。而未來的局面。呈和平團結的象徵。吾中華前途。旣尙有一線之光明。同胞們幸勿悲觀。失望而消極。應該鼓勵勇氣。整齊步伐。堅苦奮門的前進　　近來國内一致對日經濟絶交。對日宣戰。與對内精誠團結······的呼聲。高唱入雲。然而空方何補。我同胞們應把這幾點精密詳盡的下一番研究的功夫。做些比較切實的工作。不單是政府一方面的職貢。應由全民衆共同負起這種艱鉅的責任。必先下個决心。鍜練强健的體格。磨練堅苦的心志。涵養純潔的德性。保持勤奮的毅力。專心一志。各盡其人力。財力之所能。齊向科學建設的路上走。爲我國家創造一個新的基礎。闢條新生命之路政府來提倡·鼓勵。社會一致來協助·督促。青年們更要實地去做。少數及於多數。本來單純的原子。可以集成整個的結晶。惟其如此。才容易達到最後的成功。</p>
<p>抗日救國是多麽重大的問題。我們不單就表面觀察。而看得太容易了。譬如就對日經濟絶交來説。先要使人家明白行銷中國的日本貨。有多少種類。每年每月輸入噸數的比較及經濟損失的數目。日貨銷路最多的是什麽。次多的是什麽。有没有國產的代用品。怎様去研究仿造和改良的方法。怎様促進國貨的生產率。······只要把它略爲分析一下。就可以證明這些問題。都需要科學的方法去調查統計。製造。而後以貨。才有效果不然。抵制日貨。只是口頭禪而已。　　我個人以爲目前最急切的要求。（一）對日經濟絶交。堅持到底。（二）抵制日貨。不如以貨抵貨。（三）</p>
<p>永久和平統一。努力科學建設。（四）請中央頒佈五年計劃。（其實能把國民黨第一二三全國代表大會及上届國民議所决而未行的議案實行。也就夠了。）以下請分别言其概略。</p>

<p>「馬上的居士，不須失望；要覓自由空氣，請到敝庵小坐。」旣爯居工，又説敝庵，不問而知是一個方外人才説話了。陶遲勒馬看時，却是個鬚眉皓白的長老。陶遲在馬背上很有些疲倦了，遇見長老請他小坐，他正想休息一會子，再去尋覓自由空氣。</p>
<p>他很敏捷的翻身下馬，把馬匹繫在一棵槐樹上；仰首看這門楣上的匾額，却是「無礙庵　字。　和長老行過了相見禮，覺俐這長老非比等閑，是一位善智識的高僧；眉字間充滿着一種慈祥之氣。長老導他入庵，便進了無礙庵的山門。他素性是反對佞佛的，見了佛像，也不過把藝術上的眼光，賞鑒一下罷了。轉是對於那個和謁可親的長老，掬着充分的誠意和他周旋。</p>

<p>Shi Zhaoji Appointed as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Yan Xishan Exempted from Arrest</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference held its 291st meeting on the morning of the 30th. More than twenty committee members attended, with Chiang Kai-shek presiding. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) The National Government's special appointment of Shi Zhaoji as the representative to the Council of the League of Nations was ratified.</p>
<p>(2) The resignation of Wang Zhengting, Minister of Foreign Affairs, was approved, and Shi Zhaoji was specially appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(3) The National Government's approval of Wu Chaoshu's resignation as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America was ratified, and Yan Huiqing was appointed as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America.</p>
<p>(4) The National Government's appointment of Zhang Xueliang, Li Yu, Zhang Jia'ao, Li Ming, Zhou Zuomin, Yan Yangchu, Yu Hede, Wu Dingchang, and Rong Zongjing as members of the National Economic Council was ratified. Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Liu Shangqing, Lian Sheng Hai, Wang Boqun, Kong Xiangxi, Li Shuhua, and Zhang Renjie are ex officio members. (5) The National Government forwarded a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang stating that since Yan Xishan's arrest warrant was issued last year, he has been deeply restrained. At a time when foreign insults are rampant and the national situation is precarious, he has been filled with righteous indignation and has vowed to serve the country. It is proposed that the arrest warrant be revoked. Resolution: Approved.</p>
<p>(6) The Legislative Group reported its opinion on the Executive Yuan's request to formulate separate regulations for punishing criminals who manufacture and sell drugs, believing that the laws banning opium already have strict regulations for punishing criminals who manufacture and sell drugs, so there is no need to formulate separate regulations. If the provinces have different actual situations, they can formulate separate regulations and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and then forward them to the National Government for record. The period of implementation should also be determined by the provincial and municipal governments and submitted for approval in order to restrict it. Resolution: Passed according to the review opinion.</p>
<p>(7) The Executive Yuan's letter stated that the Hubei Provincial Government reported that the province's flood was extremely severe and the levee construction funds were tight. It requested that 20% of the levee donation be collected together with the newly added regular tax on import and export goods at customs, and that 10% be added to the five unified taxes to help with the funding. The Ministry of Finance reviewed and replied that it was difficult to implement. How should it be handled? Resolution: There is no need to collect additional levee donations. The National Government will order the Flood Relief Committee to coordinate the handling of all levee construction that needs to be repaired urgently.</p>
<p>(8) Approved the general budget of the national ordinary annual income for the 19th year and the budget proposals of the Academia Sinica and other institutions, totaling six cases. (Special dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting's letter of resignation stated: "Due to physical and mental exhaustion, I am unable to cope with the heavy workload. I sincerely request that someone be selected to replace me so that I can rest. I, Zhengting, have been mentally and physically weak recently. I deeply believe that the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs is complex and demanding.

I humbly ask you to understand my sincere feelings and allow me to resign and select someone to replace me so that I can rest." (Special dispatch on the 30th) League of Nations Executive Council</p>

<p>Listened to the Statements of the Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>The Assembly Passed the Disaster Relief Proposal the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council will hold its last meeting at 4 p.m. today to listen to the statements of the chief representatives of China and Japan regarding the Manchurian Incident, and then draft a resolution recording the statements of both sides and decide that if the situation in the Manchurian Incident requires the convening of the Executive Council, the Executive Council will reconvene on October 14. (Reuters telegram on the 30th) (Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly held its last general meeting today. The chairman of the Council, Lele, reported on the Council's handling of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute, saying that it was gradually improving and that after the Council meeting tomorrow, all issues should be completely resolved. Lele also praised the Chinese and Japanese representatives for being able to handle everything with a calm mind, which was very helpful in all matters. The Assembly finally unanimously passed a resolution requesting all countries to help the victims of the Yangtze River area and supporting the Council's steps for disaster relief, such as sending health workers to China to assist in eradicating the epidemic. Then, the Chinese representative, Shi Zhaoji, rose to express his thanks. (National News Agency telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the League of Nations Executive Council meeting today, Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji expressed the Chinese government's gratitude to the League of Nations and all countries for their assistance in the Chinese river disaster. Shi's words were sincere and moving. Several thousand White Russians, originally of the German race, who had moved from Russia to northern Manchuria, fled to other parts of China due to difficult living conditions. Although their situation was slightly better, it was not a long-term solution, so they requested relocation. The Council greatly appreciated Paraguay's willingness to accept them. (Reuters telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, people in the League of Nations expressed that China's appointment of Shi Zhaoji, the Minister to the United Kingdom who is also the chief representative to the League of Nations, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs will greatly strengthen China's position in the Council in handling the Eastern Provinces Incident and may allow the League of Nations Council to extend its session. Shi's demands in the Council may also be more strongly insisted upon. Those familiar with current affairs here believe that since Shi has been promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs, his position and prestige are even higher, and he will be able to force Japanese representative Aizawa to provide a concrete response to China's demands. Therefore, the resignation of Minister Wang Zhengting and the appointment of Minister Shi Zhaoji have received more attention than usual here. The Council is still seeking a way to resolve the Sino-Japanese crisis. It is now generally believed that Dr. Shi's succession as Minister of Foreign Affairs will greatly contribute to creating world public opinion favorable to China. (National News Agency telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Council continued to meet on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss the Sino-Japanese incident. As of 6 p.m., the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received a report from Shi Zhaoji. Our side has always believed that the Japanese army should withdraw immediately. The League of Nations Council will extend its closing date to October 3, waiting for the Japanese army to completely withdraw during these days. However, according to a telegram from our delegation to the League of Nations yesterday, the League of Nations observed that it would take at least two or three weeks for the Japanese army to withdraw completely, and they are organizing a Manchurian-Mongolian kingdom. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Shi Zhaoji yesterday, instructing him to make a statement to the League of Nations. (Special dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A Reuters reporter met with Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji today. According to him, he had not heard about Minister Wang's resignation, nor had he heard that he had been appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, so he could not comment on this matter. (Reuters telegram on the 30th)</p>

Unexpectedly, the two Japanese warships went along Zhudao, Xilian Island, and Yuyoumen, peered into Xugou, and anchored on a shoal 40 miles from the shore. More than 200 Japanese marines landed on Xugou by small boat on the 29th. Liang's stationed 95th Brigade tried to stop them without effect. Japanese armed soldiers acted freely, looking at the mountains and setting up machine guns to demonstrate. Liang's troops believed that the Japanese army's movements were strange and erratic, fearing that they would act out of line. For the sake of defending the territory, they specially deployed two regiments of infantry between Xugou and Yuntai Mountain and rushed to build trenches for strict defense. The Japanese soldiers were also very cunning and did not dare to cross the mountains westward to disturb Haizhou. Currently, one Japanese warship named Mutsu and one unknown, as well as two small Chinese warships, arrived near Xugou on the evening of the 28th to monitor.

<h3 id="e20">The Process of Persuading Japan <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing) Tang Erhe talked about being in Japan when the Northeast Incident occurred. At that time, the voices for resolving the issue by force were very high. He persuaded Japanese government officials and Mr. Konoe, Mr. Shibuzawa and others, and conveyed to Elder Saionji that there were five undesirable aspects of war: (1) In the Russo-Japanese War, Japan was forced to do so, so it was able to gain the sympathy of various countries. Now, if it destroys East Asian peace first, it will inevitably arouse world antipathy. (2) During China's flood, people from the Emperor down donated money for relief. Now, suddenly dealing with the Chinese with artillery fire is too contradictory. (3) Russia's five-year plan will be completed soon. With a major enemy in front of it, Japan should not oppress China too much, causing it to become too radical, and causing Korea to follow suit and get caught in the vortex, which is definitely not a blessing for Japan. (4) China is plagued by wars and has no power to fight. Japan's economy is also in a state of panic, and it has to reduce government spending and salaries. How can the people bear the war expenses? (5) War may not be able to solve the pending issues and may make both sides dig deeper trenches and build higher fortresses, making it more difficult to approach. They were quite moved. According to the Japanese constitution, the procedures for declaring war are very cumbersome. It must be passed by the cabinet, approved by the Emperor, and approved by the elders. Who knew that the soldiers would dare to disregard them and act freely? This is really a sign of the decline of the Japanese nation. In the future, if the soldiers do whatever they want, what effect will the constitution have? Our country initially assumed that the Japanese army might have some seeking-for-trouble moves, so it advocated non-resistance. Initially, it did not expect that their wolfish ambitions would actually occupy the provincial capitals of the Northeast. Fortunately, the League of Nations Executive Council is meeting, so it can make the Japanese atrocities public to the world. This matter was caused by the Nakamura Incident and the Wanbaoshan Incident in the near term, and by the accumulation of pending issues that were delayed and ignored in the long term. Now, Jizhou has been fortified, so it must not be allowed to advance any further. Unless the situation before the 18th is restored, it will not negotiate. However, thieves never go empty-handed. The Japanese will definitely not leave without conditions. Issues such as the Jihui Railway, commercial lease rights, and four railways and nine mines must be resolved. If negotiations are entered into, it is hoped that we will carefully consider the matter and reject what should be rejected and accept what should be accepted. Do not repeat the previous mistakes of fear and avoidance, which will lead to an irreparable situation. (Special dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) During the Japanese army's forcible occupation of the Northeast provinces this time, the Inspector General of Customs, Meilehe, telegraphed the customs of Andong, Yingkou, Dalian, and Shanhaiguan to investigate in detail whether there were any losses. Replies have now been received from the customs commissioners of various customs. Except for the Yingkou customs, which was occupied by the Japanese army for several hours and then withdrew after negotiations, resulting in slight damage, the other customs are fine. It is heard that the import and export of goods has been stagnant recently, and the indirect losses suffered by the various customs have reached several million. (Special dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Japan's Efforts in Propaganda Actually Succeeded in</p>
<h3 id="e22">Shifting American Attitude <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The US government's attitude towards the Manchurian Incident has not yet been decided today. The State Department seems at a loss because the Chinese side insists that Japan is still acting freely in Manchuria in terms of war, while the Japanese side is trying its best to quibble, saying that there are no war-like activities of the Japanese army in Manchuria. However, it is still continuing to try to find a solution. Moreover, Stowe, a foreign reporter for Scripps Howard newspapers, claimed that according to reliable sources from Japan, the Japanese army's invasion of Manchuria this time was completely permitted by the government. When Kwantung Commander Honjo Shigeru returned to Tokyo for eight days, the government granted him full authority to act at his own discretion in Manchuria without having to report to the government. However, the tone of New York newspapers a week ago was mostly to condemn Japan's atrocities and express sympathy for China. Now, due to Japan's vigorous propaganda, the tone has changed, and many people are in favor of the United States and the League of Nations adopting a non-interference policy.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang on the 29th, reporting the Japanese army's recent atrocities: (1) The magistrate of Jin County telegraphed that a Japanese plane came to Jin on the 24th and dropped six bombs, injuring two soldiers. (2) The Xinmin Telegraph Bureau telegraphed that three to five Japanese planes had come to Xinmin to reconnoiter from time to time in the past two days, firing machine guns several times and flying towards Dahushan from time to time.

<h3 id="e24">The Responsibility of Officials in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The nation is today as precarious as a thread. Internally, we suffer from floods, and externally, we are pressed by strong enemies. Our mountains and rivers are shattered, and the lives of our people are in misery. With its vast land and abundant resources, the nation could shake the world if its people were to rise up in unity. Yet, it has fallen into a perilous situation, as precarious as a pile of eggs, with no guarantee for tomorrow. We cannot deny that this disastrous outcome is the result of the poor governance of the past twenty years.</p>
<p>The negative aspects of the past twenty years of politics are vividly displayed before our eyes. There is no need to recount them, nor do we have the time. What we demand lies in the future, starting from today, not in settling old scores. "It is impossible to remonstrate with what has passed, but it is still possible to pursue what lies ahead." At this moment of national crisis, officials across the country should have this profound realization and sincerely redeem themselves. What is the path to self-redemption?</p>
<p>First, they should recognize their position. The nation is called the Republic of China, and sovereignty rests with the people. Officials in office are all servants of the people. They should serve all the people and the entire nation at all times. To exploit their position, enslave the people, and neglect their duties is to betray the trust of the people and violate the public will. Therefore, from today onwards, officials in office should earnestly acknowledge their status as public servants, be law-abiding, respect the will of the people, and engage in political endeavors. Second, they should recognize their own abilities and make full use of their talents. Talents should be used appropriately. The phenomenon in today's political arena is that those who excel in physics and chemistry may engage in judicial affairs, and those who excel in education may engage in diplomacy. Their skills and education do not match their positions, which misleads the nation and fails the people. This is the biggest obstacle to politics getting on track. From now on, everyone should prioritize national affairs, not treat being an official as a career, and not use being an official as a stepping stone to acquire wealth and power. They should do their best and resign from positions they are not qualified for, avoiding being a mere figurehead, and not procrastinating. Those engaged in politics should all be experts, and politics will naturally move towards progress.</p>
<p>Third, they should not hold multiple positions. The higher the position of those in politics today, the more positions they hold. Some hold nominal titles, and others hold positions remotely. No one is naturally gifted; who can excel in multiple fields? Moreover, an individual's energy is limited; who can attend to all positions without neglect? To neglect is to fail the nation, and to attend without achieving anything is also to mislead the nation. Some may think that holding multiple positions without additional pay can reduce corruption, but this can only suppress the greed for profit from holding multiple positions and cannot reduce the harm of failing and misleading the nation. From today onwards, those engaged in politics should devote their energy to one task. They should open the doors of politics wide and recruit talented individuals, so that their talents can be fully utilized to benefit the nation.</p>
<p>Fourth, they should not be greedy for money. Yue Wu Mu (Yue Fei) said, "If civil officials do not love money and military officials are not afraid of death, the nation will be at peace." Currently, the people are impoverished while the officials are wealthy. The people suffer from hunger and cold, while the officials indulge in pleasure. This is an undeniable reality. Because of greed for money, private desires overshadow their public duty. Therefore, there are many disputes, and politics cannot be clarified. Therefore, the nation becomes more chaotic, and the people suffer more. From this day onwards, those engaged in politics should pledge to be honest and upright. From personal integrity, they should establish an honest and upright government. Only an honest and upright government can be supported and loved by the people and have a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Mere empty slogans and weeping tears in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement will not help in reality. At this critical moment, the entire nation, from top to bottom, should engage in sincere repentance and strive for self-improvement and self-redemption. Then, what is there to fear from the current foreign invasion and domestic problems? Otherwise, in the long dark night, the future of the nation is truly unpredictable. In this critical time of national survival, this is what we hope for from officials across the country, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Students of Great China University</p>
<h3 id="e28">Petitioned in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Gave Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) More than 400 students from Great China University arrived at Xiaguan on the morning of the 30th, walked into the city, and went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition, submitting five requests: 1. Please prepare to declare war on Japan. 2. Please instruct the Northeast authorities to recover the territory. 3. The whole country should unite to resist foreign aggression. 4. Implement military training in schools across the country. 5. Make diplomacy open. Commissioners Yu Youren and Wang Boqun received them. Yu said that the students' patriotic enthusiasm for petitioning in Nanjing from Shanghai is very admirable. The Central Government fully accepts your petitions and is prepared to make a final decision. It is hoped that after you return to Shanghai, you will tell your classmates and explain that the Central Government will definitely seek China's freedom and equality in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, and will not disappoint the hope of the people of the whole country. Following Chiang’s instruction, he said that he was very happy that everyone was so enthusiastic about petitioning here. Although China is now being invaded by Japanese imperialism, with your enthusiastic patriotism, the country has great hope. The Central Government will definitely accept the opinions you have put forward. The responsibility of young people is very important. If young people can follow the government's policies, obey the government's command, and work together to overcome national difficulties, they will definitely be able to resist foreign aggression. The current war is not in the army, navy, or air force, but in the spirit of the youth. If the youth are patriotic, the country will be able to win the final victory. It is hoped that the young people will cultivate their abilities well and use their strength. It is not good to expose themselves casually without a considerable period. The strength of the youth needs to be based on learning. If the youth's learning and knowledge are lost, the country's strength will be lost. Taking the more than 400 students who came to Nanjing as an example, if each person lacks six hours of homework every day, the country will lack 2,400 hours of strength every day. Every inch of time is worth an inch of gold. I think gold can be obtained at any time, but once time passes, it cannot come again. It is hoped that you will return to school and tell your classmates to study hard in preparation for external affairs. The representatives were satisfied, and then Zhang Daoshen guided them to visit the Central Party Headquarters, followed by tea and snacks. In the afternoon, they visited the mausoleum and returned to Shanghai by night train. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

However, there are many twists and turns in stability and difficulty. Therefore, domestic discipline and order must be maintained without any sacrifice. If the government's prestige is slightly lost, it is equivalent to destroying the country and fueling the enemy's arrogance.

It is hoped that patriotic people will understand this and strive for success, This order, (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Cabinet Still Has Not Made a Firm Decision</p>
<p>Government Expenditure Reduction Bill Passes Third Reading in the House of Commons</p>
<p>Unemployed Workers Stage Large Demonstration Outside Parliament</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - The King returned to London from Balmoral this morning and summoned Prime Minister MacDonald to Buckingham Palace in the afternoon for an hour-long discussion. The Prime Minister then went to the House of Commons and convened a Cabinet meeting in his private chamber. It is reported that the Cabinet discussed the political situation and the election issue for an hour and a half before adjourning. A decision has not yet been made regarding the election. It is expected that MacDonald will announce the date of the adjournment of Parliament and whether or not a general election will be held after tomorrow's meeting. General opinion now anticipates that a general election is imminent and unavoidable. However, the question remains whether MacDonald will appeal to the people with the views of a single party, or gather support from all sides and act as their leader, seeking authorization from the people to implement a national plan during this emergency and have the freedom to consider taxation; or remain on the sidelines and listen to the leader of the Conservative Party; or continue in office after Parliament adjourns and handle national affairs with his existing authority until the next session of Parliament when the election issue is revisited. During a meeting of Labour Party MPs today, Henderson firmly denied rumors that he had contacted the government to join the current cabinet. Tonight, the Government Expenditure Reduction Bill passed its third reading in the House of Commons by a vote of 297 to 242 and has now been sent to the House of Lords. According to the provisions of this bill, the government has the authority to actively reduce administrative expenses without first obtaining the consent of Parliament. During the third reading of the bill, unemployed workers staged a demonstration outside Parliament, submitting a petition signed by 100,000 people against the reduction of unemployment benefits. The order was disrupted, and thousands of people attempted to storm the House of Lords but were driven back by mounted police. In the evening, several unemployed men and women attempted to drag officers off their horses, resulting in the arrest of ten people. The streets were not cleared, and traffic was not restored until several hours later.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - The Cabinet has not yet made a decision regarding the election issue. Prime Minister MacDonald may not be able to announce the date of the adjournment of Parliament in the House of Commons this afternoon. The Cabinet discussed the matter for eight hours last night but failed to reach an agreement. After the meeting, the Liberal Party cabinet members held a secret meeting to discuss their own position in detail. It is widely believed that the Liberal Party cabinet members also know that a general election is unavoidable. Newspapers this morning all advocated for an early decision, stating that hesitation is harmful to the country.</p>

<p>A telegram from Nanchang to all newspaper offices. Having noted that the Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of our banditry not yet quelled and our natural disasters, have suddenly invaded and occupied our territory with violence, massacred our people, robbed our property, harmed our officials, violated international conventions, and disrupted world peace, alarming reports have been frequently received, causing extreme horror and indignation. Unexpectedly, the descendants of the divine Yan and Huang are suffering the humiliation of being treated as horses, cattle, and slaves, reaching such an extreme. When a tiger is at one's heels, even a lame person will try to run. In the face of great disaster, what more can be considered than the depth of the enemy's penetration? The calamity of national subjugation and racial extermination is imminent. We hope that our Party comrades and compatriots throughout the country will unite as one and vow to avenge this humiliation and restore our ancestral heritage. As long as the people's hearts have not died, there is a foundation for the revival of the country. With foreign aggression pressing, we are doubly anxious about the fear of an overturned nest. We respectfully send this telegram to express our thoughts and request your kind consideration. Respectfully, the Jiangxi Provincial Government.</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanchang to all newspaper offices. Recently sent telegrams to Mr. Gu Xiangqin in Guangzhou, Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, Chen Bonan, and Li Delin, which read: "The nation is unfortunate, with frequent disasters and troubles. Internal worries are pressing, and foreign aggressions are repeatedly arriving. The Japanese army is taking advantage of our disasters and calamities to carry out their long-contemplated schemes, recklessly unleashing violence, invading our territory, massacring our compatriots, and plundering our property. All who are Chinese cannot but feel grief and anger. Gentlemen, you love the Party and the country and will not lag behind others. Can anyone be exempt from these disasters and changes? Reason has ultimate clarity but is difficult to discern, and matters are extremely easy but difficult to know. National hatred is more pressing than personal grievances. What greater tragedy can there be for the country than resentment? The difficulties of border transportation have reached such an extreme, and the suffering of the people has reached such a depth. In this time of critical survival and extinction, is there no intention of self-reflection and sincere communication? The Central Government is enduring for the sake of the country, seeking compromise and accommodation. If there is a disagreement, it is not difficult to resolve it. If you persist in your prejudices and allow the situation to deteriorate, it would be a betrayal of the interests of the people. Moreover, although the head and feet are different, they are one body, and although the hair is fine, it is related to well-being. How can you, with the kinship of the same party, suddenly raise different interests, causing heartache throughout the country? Yingqin and others are personally responsible for wearing armor and defending the country. In recent years, I have personally witnessed bandit areas, where villages and towns are in ruins, lanes are deserted, and fields are overgrown with weeds. In addition, floods are rampant, and the sea is boiling and the mountains are collapsing. The cries of sorrow and misery half engulf the land of Yu. I sincerely know that today's disaster is unprecedented in history. If our entire nation can be keenly aware, abandon old grudges, and work together to save the country, gathering many talents and consolidating the central government, then the anxieties of Goryeo will be imminent, and the national tragedy will be painfully felt. Gentlemen, follow the late Premier's teachings, personally enduring the hardships of creation. Encountering such calamities, what more can be said if the nation is doomed? If we can fortunately extend the nation's lifeline, then the gasping for breath may move heaven and earth. How much more so should the enlightened ones awaken! The ancients said, 'A country must insult itself before others insult it, and a country must attack itself before others attack it.' It is also said, 'Brothers quarrel within the walls, but unite to resist external insults.' I hope that you gentlemen will put the nation and the people first, sacrifice your prejudices, and come to the capital together, using the strength and wisdom of all to overcome this crisis. The telegram ends with choking emotions, and respectfully awaits your wise guidance," etc. Respectfully reported, He Yingqin, Chen Mingshu, He Chengjuan, Liu Zhi, Chen Diaoyuan, Lu Dipin, Gu Zhutong, Yang Cheng, He Jian, Long Yun, Mao Guangyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Li Mingzhong, Liu Zhenhua, Zhu Shaoliang, Xia Douyin, Fan Xiji, Xu Yuanquan, Wang Jun, Liu Maoen, Jiang Guangnai, Zhang Fang, Sun Lianzhong, Liang Guanying, Xiong Shihui, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Dingwen, Chen Cheng, Liu Jianxu, Fan Shisheng, Qian Dajun, Shangguan Yunxiang, Tan Daoyuan, Ruan Zhaochang, Yue Shengxuan, Chen Jicheng, Zhao Guantao, Hao Mengling, Zhang Lisheng, Wei Lihuang, Gao Shuxun, Li Yunjie, Li Yunheng, Lu Xiaochen, Luo Zhuoying, Xu Tingyao, Mao Bingwen, Zhou Hunyuan, Hu Zongnan, Xu Kexiang, Luo Lin, Lou Jingyue, Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, Huang Bingheng, Han Deqin, Gong Bingfan, Guan Shuren, Guo Huazong, Zhu Xihuang, Xiao Zhichu, Zhang Zhenhan, Guo Rudong, Xie Bin, Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Tao Guang, Li Jue, Chen Guangzhong, Chen Quzhen, Wang Jialie, Liu Heding, Zhang Zhen, Yu Jishi, Feng Qinzai, Sun Weiru, Ma Qingyuan, Jing Yuexiu, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Song Tiancai, Liu Fengqi, Zhang Ying, Chen Yaohan, Dai Minquan, Zeng Wanzhong, Guo Xun, Zhang Wanxin, Gao Zijiu, Cui Bangchuan, Yuan Ying, Lu Xingbang, Wan Dianzun, Tang Yunshan, Qiu Zhaochen, Tang Enbo, Feng Kun, Liu Yi, Liu Peixu, Lu Xingrong, Fen Hongen, Pan Shanzhai, Luo Qijiang, Xu Dezuo, Li Zongjian, Rong Jingfang, Wang Naiwen, Zhou Zhijun, Zhang Enling, and Zhang Zhanqiu together respectfully plead for your forgiveness.</p>

This time, the Japanese imperialists are implementing their ambition to invade China, occupying our Eastern Provinces and controlling our southeastern coastal areas, forcibly abducting our officials and massacring our people. When the shocking news arrived, we were filled with rage. If this can be tolerated, national subjugation is imminent. The teachers and students of our school are seething with indignation. Relying on the spirits of the martyrs, we will fulfill our national salvation duties and form an anti-Japanese national salvation association, actively engaging in combat training and vowing not to coexist with the Japanese dwarves. The Premier is above, and the martyrs are watching. We vow to be the vanguard in the war against Japan, willing to die and not dare to refuse, going through fire and water without hesitation. We are willing to rise up together with all compatriots in the country, share the same hatred and indignation, and face the national crisis together. The future of the nation will hopefully have some hope. The telegram ends with grief and indignation, and with the utmost urgency. Respectfully, all the teachers and students of the Nanjing National Revolutionary Army Martyrs' School.</p>
<p>A telegram from Yanping to Shen Bao and Xin Bao. Recently sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, which read: "The Japanese, taking advantage of our severe floods and the famine and drowning of our compatriots, have once again committed atrocities, occupying our territory and slaughtering our people, treating our nation as if it were nothing. If this can be tolerated, the nation will cease to exist. All sectors of Nanping, amid grief and indignation, convened an anti-Japanese national salvation demonstration, with the participation of over 40,000 soldiers and civilians. The entire assembly unanimously resolved to request the Guangdong authorities to abolish taxes and unite to resist foreign aggression and save the nation from danger, and also to request the Central Government to declare war on Japan. The soldiers and civilians vowed to be the rearguard," etc. The atrocities of the Japanese slaves are becoming increasingly apparent and cannot be reasoned with. We humbly request your esteemed government to swiftly declare war and inflict a heavy blow on them. The soldiers and civilians are carrying weapons and preparing supplies, awaiting your command. Survival or extinction depends on this one action. The telegram ends with indignation and fear. Respectfully, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Demonstration of all Sectors of Nanping.</p>
<p>A telegram from Diwen to all Party Headquarters, organizations, newspaper offices, and all generals and colonels. Today, a telegram was sent to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, which read: "The Japanese have occupied our Liaoning and Jilin without cause, and the massacre and looting have never been seen in world history. How can we stand in the world without avenging this hatred? But a trapped beast will still fight, let alone when it is not a trapped beast. How can we bear to sit idly by and watch the nation perish? We request that you mobilize as soon as possible and declare war on Japan, and restore the Premier's policy of alliance with Russia to jointly resist Japan. The overseas Chinese here have made up their minds to die, and if necessary, we will mobilize and return to the country to participate in killing the enemy. Urgent petition, please consider." Please advocate for unity to save the nation from danger. The telegram ends with anticipation.

<p>A telegram from Chongyang to all newspaper offices. Recently, according to reports, the Japanese used force to seize our Shenyang, Changchun, Fushun, and other places, massacring our soldiers and civilians, burning and destroying our factories, and carrying out looting, which is inhumane and disregards international law. Their intention to disrupt peace in East Asia is extremely violent and tyrannical. When the bad news arrived, the public was filled with sorrow and anger. The survival or extinction of the nation is at stake. All our compatriots should relinquish their private views and face the national crisis together, with a determination to die and a united spirit of hatred, unite as one, and drive out the three islands. We hope that you will jointly telegram the Central Government with a serious protest. Bin and others are preparing fodder for their horses...</p>
<p>The telegram ends with sorrowful cries, with both blood and tears. Respectfully, Xie Bin, the Commander of the New Tenth Division, respectfully leads all officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>Desecration of Feng Yong University</p>
<p>Professors Zhang and Qian Arrive in Beijing Seeking Relief for Shenyang's Feng Yong University: Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, Principal Feng Yong was arrested by the Japanese army on the 19th and his life and death are unknown. The students are scattered, and the school has virtually dissolved. Professors Zhang Mudan and Qian Yiguo of the school's engineering department escaped from danger in disguise and arrived in Tianjin on the 26th by taking the Beining Railway. According to them, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang this time because, in light of Feng Yong organizing the school's students into a volunteer army and sending them out with the army during the previous incident with Russia, the Japanese army feared he would take action and summoned Feng on the afternoon of the 19th. Feng went with them.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Important News Received</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Headquarters: The Japanese army, using the pretext that the school harbored military supplies, detained him. Initially, people who went to visit him were allowed to meet with him, but later, visits were rejected. The school authorities, seeing that the students were extremely frightened, organized a teaching affairs maintenance committee on the afternoon of the 22nd, intending to continue teaching. They summoned the engineering students and school staff to the drill ground and told them not to panic and that they could still attend classes, intending to calm the students down. Just as the maintenance measures were being announced, the Japanese army arrived with Feng Yong, and the situation immediately became serious. With a threatening demeanor, they surrounded the school. The students immediately retreated to the dormitories, and the teachers retreated to the lounge. The Japanese army found the director of moral education, Mr. Nangong, and ordered him to lead them to search each room for weapons. They found over 500 rusty guns, threatened and pressured the professors to leave the lounge, and then went to the drill ground, ordering the students to carry the guns onto the vehicles. When the Japanese army retreated, they stated that they had come solely to search for weapons and had not disrupted the school's security. Seeing this situation, the students scattered in chaos. It is rumored that some students were arrested after leaving the school, while the fate of others is unclear. After the weapons search, Feng was taken back to the Military Police Headquarters. When visited again, they said he had been transferred and that he could not be released because the number of weapons reported by Feng did not match. He has been missing ever since. The professors, seeing that the school could no longer maintain classes, each sought ways to enter the country. Their families, due to economic hardship, are still stranded in Shenyang. The two gentlemen arrived in Beijing yesterday (the 29th) and reported the Japanese army's trampling of the school to the Ministry of Education, requesting that measures be taken to provide relief. The submitted document is transcribed below to show one aspect of the Japanese army's devastation of our academic institutions.</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, humbly submit that the three northeastern provinces have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army, and the misery suffered by our country's officials and people has been increasingly reported in newspapers and need not be elaborated upon. We, Mu-gou, etc., who unfortunately work at Feng Yong University in Shenyang, have suffered the same devastation, needless to say. Fortunately, with the help of civil servants from the Beixue Railway Bureau, we escaped from the tiger's den and came to Beijing alone. However, Principal Feng Yong was abducted, and teachers, staff, and students have either suffered misfortune, fled, or are trapped. The pain of their situation must be briefly described to your department. Feng Yong, a son of a military man, possessed great wealth and a relatively clear mind. Witnessing the oppression of Liaoning and other provinces by Japan and Russia, he abandoned military and political life, using his own funds to establish Feng Yong University. All aspects of student training within the school followed military affairs and the Three Principles of the People, aiming to forge young people's healthy bodies and promote their broad vision for the future survival of the nation. All books and equipment needed by various departments were actively purchased without any hesitation. With three departments – engineering, law, and literature – and over 600 students, the scale of the university was well-established in just four years. In 1928, during the conflict with Soviet Russia, the school organized a volunteer army, with Yong leading the team to the front, earning considerable honor from the world. Upon his return, he became even more dedicated, constantly encouraging others with love for the country. The seeds of this disaster were also sown at this time. Because Feng University was located very close to the Japanese concession, Yong's patriotic and anti-foreign statements and activities were often revealed to the outside world. The ambitious Japanese hated him to the bone and sent two Japanese students to study, in reality to spy on the school's activities. Although we were motivated by pure and patriotic enthusiasm to encourage the staff and students, the Japanese viewed us as enemies, leading to deeper resentment. On the night of the September 18th Incident, the Japanese held a meeting at the Yamato Hotel in the Japanese concession, predetermining to appoint a native of Liaoning as the head of the Liaoning province after occupying Shenyang. The Japanese sent someone to seek Feng Yong's approval. Yong refused and said that at this time of national crisis, he could not care for himself and become a slave to a foreign country. Knowing they could not intimidate him, the Japanese sent troops to arrest Feng at 5 p.m. on the 21st. At 1 p.m. on the 22nd, armed Japanese military police came to search the school, detaining the teaching staff in a room, pointing guns at them, and forcing them to soften. We, Mu-dan, etc., vowed to die rather than submit. Later, they found the director of moral education, Mr. Nangong, and used various enticements, and brought Principal Feng Yong, ordering them to jointly hand over 500 old rifles and tens of thousands of rusty bullets that were used by the school during the resistance against Russia. Feng, Nangong, and others knew that the school had been destroyed and the rusty guns and bullets were being kept, so they had to point them out under duress, letting them transport them away, and then detaining Feng again. His life and death are unknown. Even stranger, as soon as the Japanese army left the school gate, bandits immediately followed, searching and looting one by one. Their brutality was no less than that of the Japanese army. Not a single artifact or book was spared. Therefore, some called them Japanese plainclothes soldiers and wandering Japanese. We, Mu-dan, etc., cannot name them, so we call them bandits. Since then, they came and went, alternating with each other. Male and female teachers, staff, and students were ravaged and looted, their situation too miserable to describe, simply labeled as humiliation. We, Mu-dan, etc., could not live in peace at the school, and our lives were insecure. It was useless to cry as prisoners. Moreover, most of the teachers, staff, and students were from within the customs and had no relatives and little access to information. So we disguised ourselves, mixed out of the sad and fearful provincial capital, snuck into the station, and with the help of friends, took a train south. The journey was sometimes blocked and sometimes clear, and the fear we experienced cannot be fully described. We, Mu-dan, etc., have been away from Liaoyang for six days, and we do not know what the situation is now. Principal Feng Yong is trapped in the hands of the Japanese, and his life and death are uncertain. The lives and deaths of the teachers, staff, and students in the school are unpredictable. The families of the teachers and staff are either separated or scattered, or their survival is unpredictable. Speaking of this, we cannot help but shed tears. Therefore, we hastily submit this report, earnestly requesting your department to show compassion and promptly request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Japan to protect the safety of Principal Feng Yong and the existing teachers, staff, students, and workers in the school, and to gather the refugees and provide them with funds to return to their hometowns to maintain their lives. We are extremely hopeful."</p>
<h3 id="e77">Shenyang Situation Increasingly Critical <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Food Supply Cut Off, Financial System Destroyed, Bandits Rampant</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese army has occupied Shenyang and various key locations in Liaoning and Jilin. The Northeast authorities have adopted a policy of non-resistance. Therefore, even in some places not occupied by the Japanese army, they are not using force to maintain order, causing bandits to rise up everywhere, taking advantage of the situation to kill and rob, creating an extremely terrifying era. The economy of the eastern provinces relies on the banknotes of the official silver houses and the Bianye Bank. Now that the general treasury has been occupied, the value of banknotes has fallen, and the loss of people's property is incalculable. Ordinary laborers have no way to make a living, and even middle-class families cannot sustain themselves. The situation is serious and worsening day by day. Recently, a bag of flour in Shenyang has risen to ten silver dollars and is still unavailable. The sources of other daily necessities are constantly being cut off, and the market prices are much higher than those in the flood-stricken areas. The original police force in Shenyang has been disarmed by the Japanese army, leaving only 600 unarmed police officers, who have no ability to do anything. Moreover, several police officers have been killed by the Japanese army, so the police have also scattered. County Magistrate Li has resigned, and the Japanese army has removed the barbed wire obstacles on the streets of Shenyang. In reality, no one is maintaining order in the entire city. After nightfall, it is the world of bandits and vagrants. Robberies occur every day. Especially reckless are the Korean troublemakers, using wooden sticks and small knives as weapons. The Japanese army arbitrarily arrests and ties up Chinese people, plotting to harm them. Our government officials are arrested and humiliated. Outside the commercial port, they are engaging in activities that harass the Chinese people. The American Citibank was also invaded once, and the American consul lodged a protest with the Japanese. Residents of Shenyang have moved away to avoid the situation. If the Japanese army does not withdraw for a long time, all Chinese people will abandon their property and flee completely. Since the 23rd, the Japanese army has been disrupting our country's railway order. The Beining Railway derailed on the Raoyang River section of train 102 the day before yesterday, and a temporary road was not repaired until 4 p.m. yesterday. Passenger train 103 from the west and train 106 coming from the west both passed through that location at around 5 p.m. yesterday. No danger was encountered on the road. The six foreigners taken away by the Japanese army from train 102 also took the train west. The Dalu Road has suspended all trains due to repeated attacks by Japanese aircraft. At 7 a.m. yesterday, the Japanese army dispatched another aircraft to Tongliao County, dropping three bombs at the Beining Station and one bomb at the Sitao Station. Their deliberate disruption of transportation can be seen in general. (28th)</p>

<p>Weapons from Public and Private Sectors in Andong</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: After the Japanese army entered the Chinese streets and occupied various institutions, they first focused on weapons. All weapons in various institutions were disarmed completely and transported to the Japanese police station for storage. However, the weapons of the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau were partially returned by the Japanese police station on the afternoon of the 21st due to their relationship with local security, but only large guns were returned without bullets. The Public Security Bureau distributed these empty guns to officers for duty. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 20th, the Japanese police station ordered that these empty guns be returned as they were and were taken care of by the Japanese police station. On the same afternoon, the commander of the Japanese garrison also notified the county government to hand over all the old weapons in storage. The Andong County Government received instructions from the provincial government in April of this year to also handle municipal affairs. At that time, the old weapons stored in the warehouse were transferred from the former Director Chen, including over a hundred old rifles, hundreds of rusty bullets, and short swords and bayonets. They were relics of the late Qing Dynasty, stored by successive Dongbian Yins, and transferred separately, and have only been named for more than 20 years without being usable. The Japanese army suddenly wanted to disarm them all at once. County Magistrate Wang had no choice but to supervise the responsible personnel, registering and handing over the old weapons in the warehouse to the Japanese army one by one. The Japanese army used freight cars to transport them to the headquarters of the garrison for storage. The Japanese army commander stated that the weapons of all Chinese institutions had been disarmed almost entirely. Starting from the 23rd, they searched the weapons of all shops in the city (these weapons were prepared by the shops for the use of the merchant corps trained over the years). First, they ordered the chamber of commerce to notify all merchants to take out all the guns and weapons in order for the Japanese army to take inventory. On the morning of the 23rd, the city's chamber of commerce sent members and commercial police to assist two Japanese soldiers to inspect and collect weapons from house to house according to the original gun register made by the city's chamber of commerce. By 5 p.m., the inspection of the weapons of each shop was completed. Each shop sent the weapons to the courtyard in front of the county government for on-site inventory and registration, and then used freight cars to transport them to the headquarters of the garrison in the attached land for storage. The Japanese army commander also stated that the weapons of officials and businessmen in the Chinese streets of the city had been inspected and collected. Starting from the 24th, they would inspect the weapons of the households in the four rural areas, together with the four rural public security bureaus, according to the gun register registered by the households, dividing into groups along the villages to inspect the weapons, scheduled to be completed within five days. (Starting from the 23rd, the Japanese army commander began working in the large living room of the county government and installed a military telephone in the large living room. He also notified various Chinese institutions to prepare two copies of the list of responsible personnel for file). Since the Japanese army entered the street, the silver market of the city's financial headquarters automatically closed on the same day, and the Chinese banks also closed their doors on the same day, suspending transactions. During these six days, the city's finances were completely stagnant, and merchants and people felt great pain. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the city's chamber of commerce convened all sectors to hold a meeting. As a result, the Chinese banks would open on the 24th and operate as usual, and the ingots stored in the banks would be transported to the attached land for the Japanese side to take care of. At present, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the merchants and people of this port are accustomed to settling accounts before the festival, but the Mid-Autumn Festival of this year suddenly encountered this change. The city's finances were stagnant, and both parties to the transaction were at a loss. The panic of the business community is unprecedented in the 30 years since the port was opened. (24th)</p>

<p>Japanese Residents Take the Opportunity to Provoke; Military and Police Closely Guard</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, the whole country has been unanimously indignant and determined to resist Japan. Various circles in Fuzhou held an anti-Japanese national salvation conference at the public sports ground at 9 a.m. on the 23rd under a strong wind and rain, with more than 30,000 people attending. The whole body stood in the wind and rain for two hours, and resolved (1) to send a telegram to the League of Nations, as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy, to uphold justice; (2) to send a telegram to the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to quickly end the internal strife and jointly resist foreign enemies; (3) to send a telegram to Mr. Hu Hanmin to revoke his leave of absence and take office to jointly face the national crisis; (4) to send a telegram to the National Government to follow the revolutionary diplomatic spirit and limit the Japanese army to withdraw from the country within the shortest period. After the closing of the meeting, the whole body paraded in the rain, shouting slogans along the way and distributing leaflets, which was extremely enthusiastic. Factories and shops also went on strike unanimously, and the market also stopped slaughtering pigs and selling fish, and the citizens ate vegetarian food for one day to express their grief. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side took this opportunity to transfer the Zhutong ships from Taiwan to anchor in Majiang, stating that if necessary, the Marines would land immediately. Japanese merchants in Fujian, such as Mitsui Trading Company, Osaka Company, Taiwan Bank, Boai Hospital, Toyo School, and Min Newspaper, colluded with Taiwanese Japanese nationals to secretly organize volunteer teams, carry weapons, and be commanded by Japanese police from the consulate in the hope of taking the opportunity to provoke. After receiving the above report, the military and police agencies, starting last night, sent the entire staff of the Security Office, the Investigation Team of the Garrison Command, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Security Team to the areas where Japanese residents were concentrated, such as Cangqianshan, Fanchuanpu, and Fuxin Street, for close protection. The tobacco houses and earth houses opened by Taiwanese in various places in the city were also closely guarded by the military and police to avoid accidents. At present, the local order is still peaceful. (September 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e82">Chinese Immigrants in the United States Get Rid of Another Harsh Rule <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The United States has always been extremely harsh in its treatment of Chinese immigrants entering the country. Its immigration law stipulates that Chinese people with the right to reside in the United States (i.e., non-immigrants) are divided into six categories: officials, businessmen, teachers (university teachers), students, and pastors. Anyone who comes to the United States with one of these six qualifications must maintain their original qualifications forever after entering the country. If they change or lose their inherent qualifications, their right of residence should be terminated. Therefore, although the Sino-American Commercial Treaty allows Chinese people to do business in the United States, Chinese people who do not have shops in the United States cannot enter the country according to the current regulations of the Immigration Bureau. Anyone who intends to go to the United States to do business must first go to the United States with a tourist passport, open a shop during the tourist period, and then return home or leave the United States before the expiration of the period, and then apply to the US Immigration Bureau for entry as a businessman. The suffering and losses suffered by Chinese businessmen as a result are difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Two months ago, there was a Chinese businessman in New York named Deng Fu (translation), who originally went to the United States with a tourist passport on November 16, 1925, and later established a shop in New York and changed his status to a businessman. This was heard by the US Department of Labor, which believed that Deng Fu had changed his qualifications without authorization, which was inconsistent with the law, and could not enjoy the right to reside in the United States, and was about to be deported. Deng Fu then filed a lawsuit in the Court of Appeals, arguing that his original purpose in coming to the United States on a tourist visa was to investigate business in order to decide whether he could do business in the United States. As a result of the investigation, he was quite satisfied, so he has changed his status to a businessman and should now have the right to reside in the United States. The Court of Appeals ruled that Deng Fu had the right to reside in the United States and could enjoy the rights of a Chinese businessman. The Department of Labor has always interpreted the clause in the immigration law that qualifications cannot be changed strictly, and that the six occupations of "non-immigrants" cannot be exchanged. However, the court's verdict this time interprets it as that the qualifications of "non-immigrants" cannot be changed to the qualifications of "immigrants". Therefore, since the verdict of this case, the harsh rules that Chinese immigrants have suffered for many years have been lifted. It not only has a great impact on all Chinese immigrants in the United States, but also has a relationship with the Sino-American Treaty.</p>

<p>Telegraph Request to Impose Disguised Likin: Chen Jianfang, Zhu Yongnian, Shen Yude, and more than a hundred rice merchants from Liyang in this city were recently coerced into making donations in the name of disaster relief by local ruffians and hooligans such as Zhou Yanlin. If merchants are slightly careless, their rice will be robbed. An urgent telegram was sent to the four trade associations of rice beans, grains, rice mills, and rice boats in this city, appealing for help. Now it is known that the four trade associations received the telegram and learned that the Liyang County Government actually followed the request of the disaster relief branch and openly announced arbitrary levying of donations, which is an extreme case of violating the law and harming the people. Zhou Binglin and others even set up disguised Likin stations at Duji Bridge and Yuqiao, which are located at the junction of Yi and Li, which is a strange phenomenon that has never been seen in disaster relief. All rice plates passing through the border are extorted more than ten or dozens of yuan. Once this kind of bad precedent is set, the harm is unimaginable. Therefore, yesterday, the county chamber of commerce was formally requested to forward the situation to the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, ordering the Liyang County Government to promptly abolish the case, stop the levying of donations, so as to avoid malpractices and maintain the people's food supply. After approving the letter, Chairman Qian of the Chamber of Commerce immediately telegraphed the provincial department, requesting that it be banned immediately and that Zhou Binglin and others be arrested and punished.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Foreword <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Heaven has punished China with disasters, both internal and external. Internally, floods rage, destroying homes and ruins. Externally, overseas Chinese have been slaughtered, and their heads piled up in foreign lands. The task of suppressing the Communists is unfinished, and the disaster of division is repeatedly invoked. Our eastern neighbors seize the opportunity to encroach on our territory and imprison us in history, adding to the violence. Our eyes are tearing, our hair is standing on end, our national prestige is swept away, and we are besieged internally and externally. The situation is more dangerous than ever before. However, there is a clear instruction from the ancients to revive the country in times of danger. The spirit of fearlessness has also been proclaimed by our Premier. At this time of turmoil, it is precisely when our people must be firm and strive hard. We must not be pessimistic and abandon our ambitions. Moreover, looking back at modern history, there is a glorious page that allows us to raise our eyebrows and lift our spirits, which is the recovery of Weihai. Weihai was沦爲 reduced to a foreign land for thirty-two years. After several twists and turns, it was officially taken back on this day last year. Looking back on the past and looking at the present, there are many feelings that cannot be expressed. The British occupied Weihai as a naval base, and their original intention was to balance Japan and Russia. Therefore, although the lease term was set at twenty-five years, it still had to be equal to the period when Russia occupied Lushun and Dalian. Although the leased area was only 100,000里 square of land within the bay, it could still be expanded at any time to the coast and nearby areas, within 1,500 square miles, to set up military equipment. The details of the conditions can be deeply considered. This is the first point that can be commemorated after the recovery today, when we look at the scars and feel the pain in this sea border and奧區. Tracing the recovery of Weihai, it began at the Paris Peace Conference. China failed to negotiate the Shandong issue and declared its withdrawal. The recovery of Weihai was even more hopeless. At that time, Zu Shanguo personally participated in the matter and was deeply regretful. At the Washington Conference in the tenth year of the Republic, although the British representative spoke of returning Weihai, the conditions infringed on internal affairs in various ways. After repeated negotiations, there was no result. Another ten years passed. Last year, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs took advantage of the change of the British cabinet to re-propose the matter and worked hard to negotiate. On April 18th, the special agreement on handover was signed. In June of the same year, Zu Shan was ordered to prepare for the recovery. At that time, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan were at war, and the Central Plains were in turmoil. The National Army once withdrew from Jinan due to strategic relations. The situation was precarious, and foreigners used this as an excuse to postpone the handover. Zu Shan, mindful of the importance of the mission and the urgency of the situation, traveled between Beijing and Weihai, negotiated the details, and worked hard to get things done. After several times, he was fortunate to be able to resolve the matter and officially take over on October 1st as scheduled. When I think of the preparations, it was during the hot season. The central government, due to the ongoing military affairs and lack of funds, all comrades worked with empty stomachs and served with sweat. Today marks the first anniversary. Recalling the past events, remembering the difficulty of the recovery, and seeing the mountains and rivers intact, this is the second point that can be commemorated. After the takeover, the government designated the original leased land and the old Weihaiwei city as the Weihai Administrative Region and established the Management Office. Zu Shan was appointed as the Commissioner and took charge of civil affairs. Since taking office, I have been anxious day and night, hoping to live up to the central government's entrustment and to comfort the people's eager hope for governance. The British are nearby, and their reputation is at stake. They also hope to take this as a model and a prelude to the recovery of leased land. At the beginning of the takeover, the people were suspicious and rumors were rife. After the抚绥 pacification was roughly settled, the old and new problems in Sino-foreign relations and all kinds of disputes arose at the same time. Zu Shan, with this sincerity, overcame all difficulties. In the past year, government orders have been implemented, the common people have lived in peace, and all facilities have gradually taken shape. The local order has been rectified, and there is a saying that doors are not closed at night. However, due to the lack of government funds, it has reached its limit, and it is difficult to carry out all construction and innovation. However, such as the construction of the old city roads, the construction of the rural roads, the fundamental reform of education, and the funding of students to go to school, in this day of sighing and wondering, I have also been exhausted, and I have asked myself that I have not been ashamed. Although the British governance of Weihai has been remarkable, it seems that they have taken a laissez-faire approach to society and education. Therefore, the atmosphere is塞 stagnant, the bad customs have not changed, and it is almost the same as outside the country. Since the takeover, there have been many reforms, both education and cultivation have been implemented, and after a year of implementation, gradual results have been achieved. This is the third point that can be commemorated. Weihai is a strategic area and a major defense base for our country. In the past, the British occupied it, but after ten years of struggle by our people, we were able to recover it. It can be seen that justice has not been completely extinguished, but only in our efforts. Today, people show their ferocity, defy the world, and advance troops into the eastern provinces, shocking the world. The national crisis is extremely difficult. It is hoped that our people will unite, work hard, and be united, and that it will not be difficult to secure the country. This is what I sincerely pray for in addition to describing Weihai. Now, on the occasion of the first anniversary of Weihai, a special issue is published, and I will write a few words to record my feelings as a preface.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Overview of Weihaiwei <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Region and Situation: Weihai is located in the northeast of the Shandong Peninsula, with a longitude of 122 degrees 10 minutes east and a latitude of 30 degrees 10 minutes north,扼扼 guarding the mouth of the Bohai Sea and facing Lushun to the north and south. The terrain is strategic and it is an important naval base. It is bordered by the Yellow Sea to the east and surrounded by mountains on three sides. The peaks are continuous and extend into the sea to the east, forming a鉗 crab claw shape. Liu Gong Island stands in the middle of the river, dividing the harbor into two. The east entrance is one and a half miles wide, with an island called the Sun Island in between, with a water depth of three or four fathoms. The west entrance is three-quarters of a mile wide, with a water depth of eleven or twelve fathoms, which can allow large ships to pass through. The bay is four nautical miles east-west and five nautical miles north-south, with extremely deep draft and many anchorages. With the barrier of Liu Gong Island outside, it is convenient for ships to enter and exit, and it is safe to berth in foggy weather. It does not freeze all year round. It is a natural harbor. From a military point of view, according to the elements of the topography of a military port as discussed by the famous naval strategist General Mahan of the United States, there are still many shortcomings, such as inconvenient land transportation, too few forests, insufficient protection for warships, too little grain production, and too small mouth for inconvenient training. There is still room for consideration. However, there are very few ports and bays along the northern coast of our country that can be used as naval bases. If we can strengthen the management, develop the land, revitalize commerce, and lay railways, then the veins will be connected and the situation will not be isolated. It is still an important naval base and a northern barrier to the north with Lushun as a angle.</p>
<p>Since Weihai was recovered by our country and a management office was established, its administrative area consists of the original British leased land and the old Weihaiwei City, with a total area of approximately 300 square miles, only 90 square miles smaller than Hong Kong, stretching 26 miles from east to west and 18 miles from north to south. Roughly speaking, it can be divided into three parts: one is the pier area, which is the location of the商埠 commercial port; the second is the Liu Gong Island area; and the third is the乡区 rural area. The old city area is very small, with a circumference of only six 里 li. It used to be under the jurisdiction of Wendeng County. After the takeover, it was劃 designated to the Weihai Administrative Region. Since it is connected to the商埠 commercial port on three sides, the city gates have recently been demolished and roads have been built, which have been integrated into one, and there is no longer a distinction between regions.</p>
<p>History: Weihai was Buye County in the former Han Dynasty and belonged to Donglai Prefecture. Since the Ming Dynasty Hongwu established a guard post and stationed troops to defend against sea bandits. In the fourteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, it was designated as a military port, and the Beiyang Naval Admiral's Office was established on Liu Gong Island to統轄 command the navy. Forts were also built at Huangdao Jiaojiao Cape and other places to provide defense. In the twentieth year of Guangxu, China and Japan declared war in the JIAWU Sino-Japanese War. The navy fought in the Yellow Sea but was unsuccessful. Only the Zhenyuan and Dingyuan ships returned to Liu Gong Island. The Japanese army landed from Rongcheng Bay and occupied the opposite bank. The navy blockaded the outside of Weihai Port. The naval admiral Ding Ruchang took poison and died when the food ran out and there was no assistance. Thus, Weihaiwei fell into the hands of the Japanese army. In the twenty-first year of Guangxu, the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty was signed, ceding Taiwan and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan. Russia and Germany came forward to protest and demanded the return of the Liaodong Peninsula. Russia took this opportunity to blackmail and lease Lushun and Dalian. In the twenty-fourth year, the British leased Weihai under the pretext of均勢 balance of power. The lease agreement was signed on May 13th of that year, and all the land within 10 miles of the Weihai Bay and Liu Gong Island was ceded to them. Since then, Weihai was ruled by the British for thirty-two years, until it was officially recovered on October 1st of the 19th year of the Republic of China and returned to the map. Climate: The climate in Weihai is pleasant, the land is clean, and the summers are dry and not sultry. The sea breeze blows in the morning and evening, making it even more refreshing. Every summer, many Westerners come here to escape the heat, and it is recognized as the best climate location on the coast of China. The average rainfall is 27 inches, but this year is not the case. Floods have caused disasters all over the country, and Weibu has not been spared. On August 27th and September 5th, there were two heavy storms, both reaching more than 8 inches. At that time, the狂潮猛漲 furious tides rose sharply, and the water from the four mountains rushed down. The water depth on the flat ground was three or four feet, and the shops and houses became泽国 swamps. Furniture and sundries floated on the sea. The two floods lasted for several hours before receding. The damage to agricultural products and commercial goods, and the destruction of roads, is roughly estimated to be more than one million yuan. The detailed numbers are still being investigated. However, this kind of extraordinary disaster has been rarely seen since the opening of the port. If we talk about the usual climate in Weibu, it is known for its excellence.</p>
<p>Products: Weihai's products are mainly agricultural products, such as wheat, soybeans, and sorghum, with peanuts being the most important product. Local finances depend on this, and exports are also mainly this. This spring, the乡民 farmers had a particularly rich harvest, the first in the past ten years. Just as they were celebrating the harvest year, the flood arrived in no time. The autumn harvest is bound to be poor, and peanut production will inevitably be greatly reduced, which will have a significant impact on the local economy. The second is fishing, with an annual output of more than 9 million catties, worth approximately 370,000 yuan, mostly transported to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places. In recent years, the industry has been developing rapidly since the use of汽機 motor fishing boats. However, many kinds of fish are sold at low prices because the curing method is not proper. If new-style manufacturing rights and refrigeration methods can be adopted, the profit can be secured. Weihai is an area of fishing and salt, so its salt production is also abundant. In addition to local self-use, the number of exports accounts for about 70% of the total output, mostly to Korea and Japan. However, the exact number of exports each year depends on the market price涨落 rise and fall and the supply and demand situation. The year with the most exports was 1923, reaching more than 724,000担 dan. The area of the salt fields has increased significantly in the past 30 years, and has now reached more than 6,000亩 mu. However, this year's loss due to the impact of the flood will not be small. Weihai has also made considerable progress in the benefit of sericulture. Wild mulberry trees are planted all over the mountains and waters. The total area is 600,000亩 mu. The wild silkworm cocoons produced cannot be used to set up silk factories due to lack of capital, so they are mostly transported to Yantai to be silk-spun and woven, which is why Shandong府绸 silk is produced. Other products such as lace and embroidery are also Weihai's specialty, and Chinese and foreign travelers purchase them as gifts for relatives and friends. There are currently more than 20 large-scale factories, employing many female workers, which is also a type of female occupation.</p>
<p>People: According to the latest survey, the total population of the Weihai management area is 189,801, of which 90,845 are farmers, 8,283 are merchants, 2,692 are fishermen, 8,415 are workers, 573 are from the academic community, 579 are engaged in other杂业 miscellaneous industries, and 15,520 are unemployed.</p>
<p>The residents are simple, hardworking, and diligent in their work, with no thin or cunning ways. However, after the British policy of愚民愚民 policy, the atmosphere is closed, the intelligence is low, and there is a lack of enterprising spirit. They only know how to farm and seek warmth and satiation. Since the recovery, the authorities have improved the atmosphere and enlightened the people, and it has changed significantly compared to before. Management Organization: Weihai was leased to the United Kingdom for 32 years. Once recovered, there are special circumstances in politics and economics.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Recent Photo of Commissioner Xu Zushan <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to the市 city organization law newly promulgated by the National Government, it meets the provisions of Article 3 of the second款 section, and a city should be established directly under the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering the importance of this matter, convened the relevant ministries, such as the Minister of the Interior, Navy, Finance, and Transportation, to review the management issues after the takeover and decided on three methods: (A) If the central government decides to immediately use Weihai as a military port after recovery, all facilities should be handled in accordance with military plans. (B) If, due to foreign affairs, finance, or other issues, Weihai cannot be used as a military port temporarily after recovery, then a special commissioner can be appointed by the central government to govern it during the transition period. (C) If the method in item (B) is considered inappropriate in the administrative system, then we have to follow the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 3 of the city organization law newly promulgated by the National Government to establish a city directly under the Executive Yuan. The personnel organization should be as simple and节 frugal as possible to govern and develop it. After the above resolution was submitted to the Executive Yuan, it was decided by the State Council to list Weihaiwei as a military port. Before the establishment of the military port, a management office was established and a special commissioner was appointed to govern it. This is the original reason why Weihai was not established as a city but a management office. Its organizational regulations were originally very simple. After repeated trials, there were many obstacles. After being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and amendment, it has been slightly expanded. Security Issues: Weihai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and there are many wheeled vehicles. The local security relies on the镇慑 suppression of the Northeast Naval Marine Corps and the efforts of the Director of Public Security. The place is peaceful and there is a reputation for not closing doors at night. In the past year, the people have lived in peace, there have been no disturbances, there has been no idleness in the city, and there have been no beggars on the roads. Therefore, the number of people moving in is increasing day by day. The responsibility of the military police for protection cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Construction Matters <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Weihai is surrounded by mountains and sea, located in a strategic area. Sea transportation makes it a necessary stop for Tianjin-Shanghai liners. It is quite convenient for berthing. It has an area of 3,000 square li and a population of 200,000. The benefits of mountains, forests, fishing, and salt have not been fully exploited. The people are simple and hardworking, and labor costs are low. If it can be well managed, it is not difficult to develop it into a major port. When the British governed it in the past, they did achieve considerable results in local construction. However, due to limited funding and makeshift arrangements, there were many shortcomings. In the early days of opening the port, commerce was sluggish, and tax revenue was limited. The British government's subsidies did not exceed 10,000 pounds per year. It was not until 1923 that revenue and expenditure were roughly balanced, and the British government stopped subsidies. Compared to the German management of Jiaozhou and the Russian management of Dalian, the construction achievements were incomparable. As a result, the area was only semi-developed. In the recent eight or nine years, the British, having declared that they would return the territory and that it would not belong to them forever, only maintained the status quo in their administration, and local construction was no longer their concern. For example, in terms of road construction, the roads built in the thirty-two years amounted to only fifty-two English miles, which shows the overall situation. Since our country took over, the authorities have been actively engaged in construction. Although the financial situation is extremely difficult, planning and fundraising have never stopped. In the course of a year, the new roads built have reached ten English miles, and the rural roads repaired have amounted to more than 800 li. Compared to the British, we should have no shame. Now, I will briefly describe the major projects as follows:</p>
<p>Constructing Roads in the Urban Area: The urban area of Weihai is located at the foot of Mount Naigu and was formerly under the jurisdiction of Wendeng County. It was only after the takeover that it was assigned to the Weihai administrative region. The city is connected to the commercial port on three sides and is located in a strategic area. However, the streets were rugged, uneven, and had a large ditch in the middle, five or six feet wide, to drain mountain water. Carriages and horses could not pass through. As a result, the shops were dilapidated, and the scenery was bleak. The other side of a gate was like a world away. In the spring of this year, the public office surveyed, designed, budgeted, and tendered for the construction of new-style roads. The roads still follow the old lines to connect the four gates. The road is 27 feet wide, and the ditches on both sides are 1.5 to 2 feet deep and wide. It is about to be completed. From then on, it will form a unified whole with the commercial port, developing equally. Furthermore, the width of the old streets is sufficient for use, so only a few houses were demolished to clear obstacles, and the compensation for land prices and subsidies was almost equal to the price of demolishing the houses and land. This is especially praised by the people of Weihai.</p>
<p>Repairing Rural Roads: There are more than 370 villages in the Weihai administrative region. The roads were narrow, and whenever it rained, they were muddy and impassable. Traffic between the villages and the commercial port was extremely difficult. Therefore, the public office convened meetings with the village heads of each district to make use of the slack farming season in early spring. Each village voluntarily gathered laborers and provided tools to repair the roads in sections according to the plans and regulations set by the public office. A total of more than 395 li of main roads with a width of 12 feet, 172.5 li of branch roads with a width of 8 feet, and more than 234 li of village roads with a width of 6 feet were completed, totaling 802 li. The culverts and bridges were constructed by the public office through bidding. The rugged paths have all become smooth and easy to travel, which is convenient for travelers.</p>
<p>Building the Weihai Recovery Memorial Tower: Weihai was leased to Britain for 32 years before it was returned. This not only set a precedent for the Republic of China to recover leased territories, but it is also something that our Chinese nation should celebrate. The management office, in view of this, built a tower in the center of the Weihai urban area, Whale Park (formerly known as Wukou Garden), to commemorate the event and awaken public attention. The tower is inscribed with the "Record of the Recovery of Weihai" and the "Special Agreement on Handover," and also contains the Three Principles of the People. The tower is 32 feet high, representing the number of years of the lease to Britain, so that people of Weihai and tourists who pass by will feel alert and cautious in addition to joy. Its meaning is profound and far-reaching.</p>
<p>Reconstructing the Huancui Tower: Several hundred steps north of the west city gate of Weihai, there is a high hill, which is the foot of Mount Naigu. Below the hill, fields surround it, forming a defensive posture. The terrain is majestic and the scenery is the best in the East Sea. The Huancui Tower is located on its peak. From the tower, one can see the distant East Sea and a panoramic view of Weihai. The tower was built in the second year of the Hongzhi reign of the Ming Dynasty. It has been in disrepair for many years, with crumbling walls and damaged windows. If it is not repaired, the scenic beauty of hundreds of years will be difficult to preserve. The management office convened local people to discuss reconstruction. Everyone agreed and put the project out to tender. The tower is 37 feet deep and wide, and 30 feet high. It is divided into two floors, with flying eaves and soaring pavilions, purely in the style of Chinese architecture. Each floor has a large room with chairs and seats for tourists to rest. Pavilions, gardens, and trees are arranged below the hill, making it a scenic spot in Weihai. Constructing Sea Bathing Rooms: Sea bathing is beneficial to health, as everyone knows. Weihai is located on the coast, and sea bathing is most suitable in summer. However, residents bathing in the sea everywhere not only exposes their chests and backs, which is unsightly, but also easily leads to danger. The management office, in view of this, built 22 sea bathing rooms north of the new wharf. The seabed there is flat. The rooms are divided into four rows, with the rear row 10 feet apart. Each room is about 4 feet wide, 6 feet deep, and 8 feet high, and can accommodate two people to change clothes. The larger ones are four rooms, with twice the area. The roofs of the rooms are covered with white iron and painted light green. Each room has wooden stools, shelves, and clothes hooks. The facilities are comprehensive, which will benefit residents and Chinese and foreign tourists who come to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief description of the major projects. In addition, there are repairs to the wharf, renovations of the original roads, and surveys of the Yekou road route plan, and the construction of a public auditorium. Under the extreme financial difficulties, and in a period of only one year, the construction work was still carried out diligently. Without enthusiasm and perseverance, how could this be achieved? It is expected that by this time next year, the achievements in construction will be even more remarkable.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Financial Overview <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for the Sharp Decline in Local Tax Revenue: During the British administration of Weihai, it was specially designated as a free trade port in order to develop commerce. No customs duties were collected, so merchants gathered and trade flourished. Tax revenue gradually increased, reaching 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per year. After our country took over last year, the central government stipulated that it would not be a tax-free port, in order to comply with the principle of equal tax burden and unified finance. Customs, salt administration, stamp tax, tobacco and alcohol, and cigarette agencies were successively established. The people's burdens increased, and prices rose. Merchants from various ports who came to Weihai because it was tax-free also left one after another. As a result, commerce suddenly declined, and local income decreased sharply. This is a natural trend that cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties: Local tax revenue, including house rent, land tax, wharf fees, and license fees, is about 200,000 yuan per year. However, the expenditures approved by the central government require 390,000 yuan per year. The shortfall is subsidized by the national treasury with tens of thousands of yuan per month to maintain operations. However, during this period of political tutelage, local construction is of utmost importance. Road construction requires huge sums of money. Other items, such as the preparation for self-government, the renewal of education, social relief, and party affairs examinations, also require large amounts of funding. As a result, the financial situation is extremely strained. The central government's tax revenue accounts for almost 70% of the total revenue. It is hoped that the amount of the monthly subsidy can be increased and allocated on time, so that Weihai, which has regained its territory, can be actively constructed and achieve good governance.</p>
<p>Distribution of Government Expenses: The difficulty of government expenses is as described above. We have no choice but to make every effort to economize in order to provide financial support. However, the complexity of the public office's affairs is similar to that of a municipal government, but the staffing is extremely simple. The salary levels are set at the lowest level for officials. Therefore, the salaries of all employees and the wages of the police only account for 49.9% of local expenditures. During the British administration, the staffing and police force were smaller, but the expenditure accounted for 51.9%. Public works accounted for 19.3%, education accounted for 5.4%, medical care and health accounted for 2.6%, and all other items accounted for 23.8%. From October of the 19th year to June of the 20th year, a total of nine months, the total expenditure, including the cost of road construction in the urban area, amounted to more than 290,000 yuan, which did not exceed the budget approved by the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Development Plan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Weihai was just a desolate fishing village more than thirty years ago. After the British leased it, commerce was sluggish and income was scarce for the first twenty years. Therefore, Weihai was designated as a free trade port, and no customs duties were levied on goods, only a 1% ship tax was collected. In the last ten years, commerce has gradually developed. After the takeover, customs and national tax agencies were fully established. However, merchants have short-sighted views, and various industries have declined. Without planning for development, how can the situation be saved? In the past, when Confucius went to Wei, he enriched the state through commerce. When Guan Zhong governed Qi, he managed the mountains and seas. Weihai has always been known for its benefits of fish and salt, and now it has a population of 200,000. There are several ways to guide the situation:</p>
<p>1.  Constructing a Wharf: During the British administration, it was recognized that there was no reliable wharf for the liners that came and went. Whenever there was wind, rain, or dark nights, it was inconvenient for passengers to get on and off and for goods to be loaded and unloaded. A famous engineer was hired to conduct a survey and planned to collect a wave barrier tax to cover the expenses. However, the amount of funding required was huge, and the wave barrier tax was very small. In addition, the return of the territory was approaching, so the project was shelved. After the takeover, construction should be carried out in advance to facilitate water transportation. According to the recent plan of the management office, the future center of Weihai City will be near the large parade ground south of Wukou, where a new wharf will be built. Although it is not possible to carry out the project now, at a minimum, the existing west wharf, which is 20 feet wide and extends about 180 feet into the sea, must be expanded. Even at low tide, it can accommodate ships of 1,000 tons. This is a temporary measure, not a permanent solution.</p>
<p>2.  Constructing City Housing and Hotels: Weihai has pleasant scenery and is fog-free throughout the year, surpassing Qingdao and Yantai. It is truly a good place to live and escape the summer heat. During the British administration, British warships and men and women from various countries came in droves during the spring and summer, which had become a habit. After the takeover, 26 water bathing rooms and plank houses were added, and Dongshan Park was renovated. More Chinese and foreign men and women came to Weihai. The existing Dongda Building and Donghai Hotel were in short supply. In addition, the city is prosperous, and the population has increased. There is also a sense of overcrowding. There is still a lot of government land available, and local people plan to obtain it in accordance with the regulations and build city housing and hotels to facilitate residents and visitors. In an instant, the city can be tenfold larger, which is guaranteed.</p>
<p>3.  Constructing a Waterworks Plant: In places where commerce is developed and Chinese and foreigners live together, drinking water is of utmost importance. During the British lease of Weihai, due to the difficulty in finding water sources, wells were still dug to obtain water. For thirty years, no waterworks plant was built. After the takeover, the local government aimed to improve health facilities and believed that well water was astringent and not suitable for hygiene. It was proposed that a waterworks plant be jointly operated by the government and merchants. Currently, capital is being raised and water sources are being selected. If this can be realized, not only will this type of business be profitable, but the local people and the Chinese and foreigners who come to Weihai will benefit greatly. This is very beneficial to municipal and health matters.</p>
<p>4.  Manufacturing Plant for Fishery, Navigation, and Engine Supplies: Weihai's fish, especially yellow croaker and large net fish, are the main products. Each year, there are about 300 to 400 fishing boats in this port and about 300 foreign fishing boats. They all use old-fashioned equipment and cannot compete with motorized boats. Therefore, the rights are all taken by foreigners. Although we are eager to resist, all fishing, navigation, gasoline, machinery, and various fishing equipment are imported. We only get a small profit, and the power is still in the hands of foreigners. The gains do not make up for the losses, which is not a good policy. It is best to select fishery specialists to conduct a thorough investigation and prepare to establish a manufacturing plant for fishery, navigation, and engine supplies. On the one hand, we will revitalize the aquatic products industry, and on the other hand, we will recover the lost rights. The livelihood of the sea country depends on this.</p>
<p>5.  Establishing a Cold Storage and Canning Factory: The cost of living in Weihai is not high. Whether it is aquatic products or ordinary poultry, pigs, cattle, chickens, and ducks, the prices are lower than in any other city. In the past, during the British administration, British merchants repeatedly wanted to establish such a factory because of the great profits, but due to the approaching return date, they did not have time to do so. After the recovery, the local government is determined to establish various new industries. Assuming that in an instant, the wharf is built and the fishery is developed, without planning a way to sell the products, it is impossible to obtain special benefits. If the local authorities and local wealthy merchants can work together to promote the sale of all fresh and canned goods, it will benefit both the city's tax revenue and the citizens' economy.</p>
<p>6.  Improving Salt Production: Weihai is rich in salt production, which is one of the port's products. The port has about 5,600 mu of salt fields. According to the 1926 report, the salt production was about 195,190 dan. The sales were mainly to Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan. The amount transported to the mainland was very small, except for smuggling. This is because the port's manufacturing is not good, so sales in the mainland are not smooth. Recently, domestic capitalists and industrialists have come to Weihai one after another to investigate the salt fields, salt beaches, salt production fees, and the quality and taste of salt, etc., preparing to try to establish a refined salt company in Weihai to promote the industry. If this can be achieved soon, Weihai will not be difficult to become a major salt field. Let us wait and see.</p>
<p>7.  Adding Sanatoriums: Weihai has a suitable climate, and various elderly, disabled, tuberculous, and mentally ill people come here for recuperation in an endless stream. After the recovery, there is a public hospital in the wharf area and a branch hospital at the Liugong Island hot spring. The facilities are very complete. Currently, the management office is hiring a foreign doctor in accordance with the treaty and is surveying the Liugong Island area to build a sanatorium, using the existing doctors to take on medical services. It is currently being prepared. When it is completed in the future, I know that many Chinese and foreigners will come to Weihai for treatment, which will benefit both patients and the city.</p>
<p>8.  Improving Sericulture and Fruit Trees: Weihai is rich in silkworm cocoons, and the sales are also extensive. However, the mountain silkworms are large and the silk is coarse. According to old habits, they are placed on oak trees and allowed to eat and sleep freely. When reeling silk, there is no scientific method, so it is difficult to compete with others. It is necessary to send personnel to the southeastern provinces to study various new methods of raising and planting mulberry trees, and then establish a larger factory to serve as a model. Furthermore, Yantai and Weihai are close, and the climate and soil are similar. Yantai apples, grapes, and other fruits are exported in large quantities every year, making huge profits. Weihai is the opposite, which is very puzzling. It is now heard that the management office is lending low-interest capital from public funds to tree planters, and after they make a profit, they will repay it in installments. On the one hand, they are advising people to voluntarily raise funds and expand countless gardens to help make up for the inadequacy of public resources. As the saying goes, "Ten years to grow trees," which is also a way to get rich.</p>
<p>9.  Lace and Embroidery Factory: Weihai's lace and embroidery have always been prosperous. There are no less than a dozen large and small factories, and they are shipped overseas every year in no small quantities. Unfortunately, the scale is small, and the management and guidance are not very legal. It is necessary to select personnel who are proficient in handicrafts, refer to the necessities of foreigners, and on the one hand, renovate the patterns to cater to the trend, and prepare to establish a factory for special improvement in order to expand sales and open up sources of profit.</p>
<p>10. Preparing to Establish a National Goods Exhibition Hall and a National Goods Market: During the British administration of Weihai, it was a tax-free port, and the import of foreign goods was self-evident. After the recovery, in order to resist foreign goods and promote domestic goods, the management office has announced the rules for soliciting national goods from various provinces, and has selected a site to prepare to establish a national goods market for people to visit. In the future, foreigners who come here for business and navy summer vacations will visit the market to view the exhibits and choose to buy them, which will not only promote the sales of domestic goods, but also activate finance.</p>
<p>11. Preparing to Establish a Local Bank and Issue Local Public Bonds: Weihai issued banknotes indiscriminately without any restrictions. After the recovery, the public office strictly prohibited this. The Bank of Communications and the China Industrial Bank activated the market, and their credit was obvious. However, the development items that should be carried out locally are as listed above. It is difficult to cook without rice. The local government should raise a large amount of capital, present it for approval to establish a local bank, and specialize in developing local industries. When necessary, it may also refer to the established cases of the provincial and municipal governments and apply for the issuance of local public bonds to facilitate turnover, gather local funds, and develop local business. This is also what the central government is happy to support.</p>
<p>The above listed items are all based on facts. Regarding the history before the lease, the process of recovery, and the work after management, the facts and plans are described separately, without pursuing high ambitions or advocating empty talk. This should be welcomed by those who are concerned about newly recovered leased territories such as Weihai.</p>

<p>University Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Universities Joint Conference held its 29th meeting yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Chu Minyi from the French National Institute of Technology, Chu Fucheng from the Faculty of Law, Ou Yuanhuai from Great China University, Xie Xunchu from Jinan University, Liu Zhanen and Fan Zhengkang from Shanghai University, Pan Gongzhan and Zhu Yingpeng from China Public School, Jin Tongyin from Fudan University, Hu Changbing from Guanghua University, Lu Xiyan from Tongji University, Sheng Zhenwei from Soochow University Law School, Zhu Foding from the School of Law and Politics, Li Zhaohuan from Jiaotong University, and Cao Liangxia from Datong University.</p>
<p>It was resolved to issue a declaration, the original text of which is as follows: Since the brutal Japanese suddenly invaded the Northeast, seized our territory, massacred our people, trampled on our sovereignty, and destroyed our construction, not only is Liaoning and Jilin lost, but the crisis is also imminent. Moreover, national demise and racial extinction are just around the corner. We cherish peace by nature. Initially, the whole country hoped that reason and justice might still exist in the world and that the League of Nations would make a fair decision to maintain world peace. However, the news is that there is nothing more than hoping for direct negotiations between China and Japan. Just think, under violence, how can there be negotiations? Bullying the weak and flattering the strong has become the norm. International justice has long ceased to exist, and how can the self-salvation of the Chinese people be delayed any longer? Therefore, the national spirit is boiling with indignation, and resisting Japan and saving the country is a united effort. Young students, full of vigor, uphold their conscience and burst forth with passionate impulses. They abandoned their studies to conduct propaganda and petitioned in Beijing. Although the methods may be debatable, the purpose is probably not otherwise. Indeed, during the Franco-Prussian War, the songs of Paris did not cease, and during the Russo-Japanese War, the schools of Tokyo remained open. But the governments of those countries took responsibility and did their best to defend against the foreign enemy. It has never been heard that when the enemy comes, we run away and offer no resistance. This Eastern Province incident came suddenly. The brutal Japanese had long harbored a conspiracy and made a well-thought-out plan. But what about our country? Before the incident, there was no diplomatic intelligence. After the incident, there was no military resistance. It was as if the responsible officials were all useless figures occupying positions without doing any work. Those who should be responsible are not responsible, then how can those who should be at ease be at ease? Therefore, in the autumn of popular indignation and at a time when the government is hesitant, young students do not hesitate to sacrifice their studies to request that our revolutionary government make a decisive decision. The matter is indeed not an example to be followed, but the sentiment is understandable. However, in the past few days, the work has been intense. In terms of propaganda, resisting Japan and saving the country is almost a household name. In terms of petitions, the government and the people have actually reached the same goal through different paths. In the future, the way to save the country lies in everyone having a heart ready to die and in embarking on a long-term effort. The government should streamline its forces and defend its territory. The people should align their steps and follow the orders of the central government. We, the young students, being the elite of the country, should have a patriotic fervor that not only seeks a formal expression but also maintains a practical and lasting commitment. Therefore, since the highest authorities of the government have already indicated that the responsible officials will be punished, the lost territory will be recovered, and the treaties that disgrace the country will be rejected, then the resentment, anxiety, and trepidation that we had in the past have now been largely resolved. Young students must not forget their great responsibility of saving the country, neglect their academic cultivation, military training, and preparation for ultimate sacrifice. If they merely express their patriotic zeal in a passive way, it is tantamount to suicide. Therefore, to plan for the survival of the nation, we should have a positive expression and intensify our work to save the country. We have been running schools for many years, and we love young people and the country. We ask ourselves if we have ever lagged behind others. Faced with the current national crisis, we cannot tolerate pushing the boat with the current or seeking temporary ease. Therefore, we express our sincerity and issue a declaration. We hope that teachers and students will cooperate, resume their studies, strengthen their physiques, enhance their knowledge, and unite their wills to resist the strong neighbors. And the government should also make major decisions as soon as possible and announce them to the people of the country so that those who have failed in their duties will know to be vigilant, and those who are loyal and virtuous will be able to serve, and that the salvation of the crisis depends entirely on this. We respectfully submit this declaration for public consideration and hope that our countrymen will advise us.

<h3 id="e105">Resolution of Anti-Japanese Association of Secondary Schools <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>

The November futures opened slightly lower by one tael and six cents, at 702 taels, followed by 01 tael, but there was very little trading, because someone outside the market wanted to sell it at a discount smaller than the listed price, so the opening was low.

Only the 1929 and 1936 bonds were not suspended, because a major player had bought a large amount of the 1929 bond. Because the bonds were suspended, there were few transactions. In the morning session, there was only one transaction. Observing the bond market, it seemed that the amount of spot goods circulating in the market was enormous, like sellers urgently trying to sell. If the diplomatic situation did not improve, the market would not stabilize, and the price would unlikely rise. The day's situation was also expected to have a high chance of price drops. The afternoon market opening was delayed until around 6 PM due to the collection of additional security deposits. The 1929 bond price remained stable because of continued purchases. Except for the 1936 bond, which fell 1.1 yuan, the other bonds all fell by around 4 yuan compared to the previous week. There were no spot transactions throughout the day. In the futures market, October futures had one transaction in the morning totaling over 2,600,000 yuan. In the afternoon, there were only 180,000 yuan, totaling only 2,800,050 yuan. The quiet market was rarely seen recently.</p>

<p>Securities Exchange Imposes Restrictions on Speculative Trading</p>
<p>Buyer's Clearing Deposit Increased by 800 Yuan</p>
<p>Sellers Must Provide Actual Goods for Next Month's Futures</p>
<p>The situation in the securities market has been very serious this past week. Fortunately, due to slight improvements in the diplomatic situation and the willingness of three major banks to maintain it, the market was boosted. Only on the previous day was safe delivery achieved, and the market situation was slightly eased. However, considering the ongoing worsening diplomatic situation, with Japanese troops as barbaric as before, continuing to aggressively invade, and the League of Nations only knowing to shirk responsibility and being unable to handle the situation, the Chinese people feel very excited about this situation. Therefore, the diplomatic situation with Japan is becoming very serious. Under this kind of situation in the securities market, due to market uncertainty, everyone is inclined to sell, and it is impossible to expect prices to rebound soon. Considering this, everyone feels quite uneasy. In order to protect genuine investment transactions and to control speculators, it is necessary to set up security measures. Yesterday, the Securities Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Finance and has decided that for bond sales transactions, except for the 1936 national bond and long-term finance, all next month's futures contracts must be delivered with actual goods. This way, short sellers will have no way to maneuver. The Securities Exchange also decided to collect an additional clearing deposit for buyer's transactions, 800 yuan per 10,000 yuan face value. However, for hedging transactions, the seller is still exempt from providing actual goods. All of this has been announced by the Securities Exchange and communicated to all brokers. With these restrictions on the securities market, market uncertainty may be slightly reduced, and the market can be expected to be safer. According to past customs, next month's futures are usually delivered with actual goods the day before this month's futures are suspended. Now, even this month's (October) futures are limited to delivery with actual goods.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yarn Market Uneven <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is relatively stable, but the trend is extremely complex, with prices fluctuating, making it difficult for people to feel at ease. This is due to the strong anti-Japanese movement. Japanese yarn cannot be sold, resulting in a great shortage of spot goods. There are many speculators, and many people buy when prices fall. However, the national crisis is severe, and the money supply is difficult to loosen. It is impossible to predict the future situation.</p>
<p>The trend in the man-mark market is chaotic. The opening price in the morning was high due to enthusiastic demand for spot yarn. Prices for all months increased by more than one or two taels, with a slight drop in the second and third rounds of trading. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.026 taels. The opening price in the afternoon fell by 0.089 taels. After the second round of trading, prices rose by one or two taels. The closing price then weakened again. As a result, prices for the near months fell by 0.012 taels, while prices for the distant months rose by 0.078 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 84,600 bales. Sales included: Jifeng 1,050 bales, Rongxing 3,600 bales, Maixing 1,400 bales, Yuji 1,250 bales, Ruidi 2,850 bales, Hengde 1,150 bales, Yicheng 1,800 bales, Xincheng 1,000 bales, and Lichang 1,500 bales. Purchases included: Jifeng 1,850 bales, Gengjue 6,500 bales, Senkang 2,050 bales, Changfeng 1,600 bales, Yongchang 1,150 bales, and Xiesheng 1,150 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>February | 166.0 | 1 | 77,400</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Relatively Flat</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are relatively flat. Statistics for the day show that all dealers purchased a total of 1,300 bales. 580 bales were received from fellow dealers, 35 bales from Wuhu, 190 bales from Hankou, 100 bales from Guangdong, and 100 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Cotton Market Slightly Stabilized <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose slightly in the afternoon, showing a slightly firm trend. Due to poor domestic production and a lack of goods arriving from various regions, most cotton merchants are in a bullish position. There is speculation on squeezing out short positions in October, so the market price is rising. However, overseas US cotton has fallen below the 6-cent mark, indicating a dangerous situation. Furthermore, various foreign firms are peddling spot cotton in the market at special concessions, and the factories are purchasing large quantities of cheap foreign cotton. It is still difficult to expect a significant improvement in the future.</p>
<p>Large Traders Covering Shorts in the Hankou Mark Exchange</p>
<p>In the morning session of the Hankou Mark Exchange, due to the continuous fall of US cotton for two days, market sentiment was flat, and prices for each contract fell by 0.02 taels. In the afternoon, large traders covered their short positions, and the Jinxin contract rose again, with prices for each contract rising by 0.023 taels. The total trading volume was 117,000 dan. Sales included: Gongtai 5,700 dan, Changfeng 5,600 dan, Dachang 1,700 dan, Dafu 2,100 dan, Deji 2,100 dan, and Yuanda 4,700 dan. Purchases included: Xincheng 13,700 dan, Yuchang 2,400 dan, Changhe 2,300 dan, and Yuande 4,200 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Indian Cotton Boosted by Budget Announcement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed. It was initially weak due to sales in the South, but then recovered due to manufacturer purchases of forward contracts. Futures fell by 6 to 10 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 14 to 19 points, and spot prices fell by 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 55 points. Indian cotton was firm due to the Indian budget announcement. Pinjore rose by 2.5 rupees, Umra rose by 3 rupees, and Baroach rose by 3.25 rupees.

<p>Although the sources for various dealers in Nantou yesterday were still limited, retail sales in urban and rural stores were discounted due to urgent financial pressures. Transactions were still slow, and wealthy households were weak. Therefore, the prices of thick broken japonica and fresh indica fell by another 0.2 taels. The prices of thin paddy and selected fresh indica were also reduced by 0.2 to 0.3 taels. Sales of foreign long-grain rice were slow, and the market was also weak. The arrival of new japonica rice was limited, and the price was soft by 0.2 taels. New foreign Luzhou long-grain rice was down by nearly 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The weather in Xinzha yesterday was sunny, with 30 to 40 sources of goods. Outgoing shipments were increasingly rare. Thick and thin japonica rice was stagnant with the out-of-town buyers. The market softened by 0.3 taels. Fresh japonica rice from Wuxi continued to arrive and the price softened by approximately 0.1 taels. The arrival of green glutinous rice was robust but demand was weak, and inventories remained. The price fell by a small 0.3 to 0.4 taels. The arrival of fresh Jiaobai long-grain rice and fresh Luzhou foreign long-grain rice was extremely slow, with prices falling by 0.5 yuan. The arrival of glutinous rice was scarce and sales were active, and the market was firm. The total amount of goods from the river factories was approximately 2,300 dan.</p>

<p>Foreign Firms Continue to Dump</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no demand from local buyers for spot foreign rice, and the entire market saw no transactions. Foreign firms were actively dumping forward contracts, and buyers were watching. The market was increasingly weak. As a result, the price of short-term forward contracts fell nearly 0.01 yuan, and the price of new long-term contracts also fell 0.05 yuan. Xiangmao sold 3,000 tons of short-grain rice for February-March delivery at a price of 5.65 taels, and repurchased 100 tons of short-grain rice for November delivery at a price of 5.45 taels, and 400 tons for February-March delivery at a price of 5.7 taels. These transactions occurred in the morning. The market sentiment was very stagnant in the afternoon. There are concerns that the price may fall further today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Flour and Wheat End-of-Month Delivery Completed <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Flour Stacks Have 60,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the month, and the flour market was closed. The end-of-month delivery has been completed, with only 60,000 bags of spot flour delivered to factories. This is because most of the flour was repurchased at a lower price before the end of the month, resulting in such a small delivery volume. Old Che brand accounted for 42,000 bags, Maigen accounted for 15,000 bags, and Eagle Ball accounted for 3,000 bags. The buyers were retail customers. The trading of futures contracts was very active in September, and the detailed numbers are recorded below (unit: 1,000 bags).</p>
<p>Month | Volume</p>

<p>September | 4,280</p>
<p>October | 4,717</p>
<p>November | 4,791</p>

<p>February | 6,132</p>
<p>Wheat Delivery Orders - 25 Cars</p>
<p>There was no market for spot wheat or forward wheat yesterday. The wheat contracts for this month have been completed and delivered. The total delivery volume was only 25 cars. This is because the market price fell sharply the day before closing, and large short sellers took the opportunity to repurchase. Therefore, the delivery volume was greatly reduced. Even direct delivery accounted for less than 20 cars. Tailun purchased the most, totaling 19 cars. The remaining purchases were only one or two cars each. The sellers were also scattered. Runde sold 5 cars, Detao sold 7 cars, Juyuan sold 5 cars, Runqang sold 6 cars, and Zhicheng and Yong sold 2 cars. Retail deliveries were made without any inquiries from trading firms or factories.</p>

The current and forward sugar in Java also lack fluctuations. The Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sugar white price in the trade association market is still 11.4 taels, but the trading is quiet because the number plate is grandly opened. No. 20 medium sugar white is 10.09 taels, No. 9 Dutch red is 9.4 taels, and cotton Dutch white is 11.9 taels. The market is stable. The Taikoo sugar market is rising again.

On the number plate, Jinhua Company sold 3,000 bags of new raw sugar white spot, priced at 11.4 taels, Huaxin also opened 1,000 bags, priced at 11.45 taels, and Zhenxiang Company opened 1,000 bags of old white bag raw sugar, priced at 11.3 taels. The trading firm's intention to purchase is active, and the market is strong. Taikoo sugar suddenly opened nearly 20,000 bags of goods that were being loaded.

<p>The first batch of Quanzhou large-bubble dried longan only has more than 400 boxes, and most of the quality is still dry. It feels quite fashionable since it is the first time to see new products.

<p>Since the first day of this month, coal merchants in this city have stopped importing Japanese goods. All coal in stock, except for what is currently in this store, must be registered with the Anti-Japanese Association and stamped with a seal. The market trading yesterday was extremely sluggish, and the transaction volume was less than 1,000 tons. The reason is that after the price limit, general large trading houses and coal stores have closed off the spot goods and will not sell them, waiting for a good sale in the future. However, general small trading houses and coal stores have limited capital and not much inventory, and some have even sold short with no inventory. Panic suddenly arises. It is heard that several companies have jointly sued the association, asking them to circulate and sell the inventory of large trading houses.</p>

<p>Presented to the Central Government Telegram: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: This time, the Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of the aftermath of our country's floods and banditry, sent troops to the Eastern Provinces, carried out armed aggression, forcibly occupied our territory, and massacred our compatriots, with unparalleled ferocity and brutality. Judging from their intentions, they intend to use the Manchurian issue as an excuse to annex China and pursue their New Continent ambition policy. If we tolerate this, the country will be destroyed in no time. Our association convened a conference today, and the participating representatives were all filled with righteous indignation, vowing to fight a decisive battle with the brutal Japanese. We urge our Central Government to make a decisive decision, order the Japanese army to withdraw the troops that have been stationed without cause, return the occupied areas, and compensate for all damages. Otherwise, issue a clear order to sever diplomatic relations and send troops to punish them. It is better to die like jade than to survive like broken tiles, in order to preserve the survival of our Chinese nation and avoid destruction due to showing weakness. As for the senior officials who are ineffective in border defense and the diplomatic authorities who are unable to cope, judging from the situation and reasoning, their crimes deserve punishment. We also ask our Central Government to severely punish them, either order them to make amends for their crimes or immediately issue an order to dismiss them, in order to appease public anger and uphold national discipline.

<p>Telegram to Zhang Xueliang: To Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang of Beiping: The brutal Japanese are acting wildly, invading our Eastern Provinces. You, sir, who are responsible for national defense, did not fire a single arrow and surrendered to others with folded hands. Judging from the situation and reasoning, it is difficult to shirk your responsibility. What is past is past, but the future can still be pursued. We still hope that you will fulfill your natural duty to defend the country, concentrate your troops, drive the Japanese invaders out of the country, and recover all lost territories. Then the people of the country can understand you to a considerable extent. Otherwise, we dare not say any more. Furthermore, it has been reported in recent days that the Japanese army has telegraphed you, sir, to return to Shenyang to take charge of the administration, and the Japanese consul in Shanghai has also rushed to Beijing to entice you with sweet words and benefits. At the same time, the Japanese side suddenly has the absurd idea of the independence of Manchuria and Mongolia. In this harsh environment and under the pressure of force, a slight carelessness on your part will bring eternal shame. We also hope that you will cherish the rise and fall of the country and the nation, resolutely reject all the absurd proposals of the Japanese side, and not engage in direct negotiations with them, so as not to fall into their treacherous schemes. We dare to offer our humble opinion based on the spirit of the Spring and Autumn Annals, which requires the wise to be prepared. What to do and where to go is up to you, sir, to decide. The Shanghai Various Native Place Associations Anti-Japanese National Salvation Society bows in respect.</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangzhou: To Mr. Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, Gu Xiangqin, Chen Bonan, and Tang Shaochuan in Guangzhou: The brutal Japanese are acting wildly, and the whole world is filled with indignation. If this can be tolerated, the country will be destroyed in no time. Our association members believe that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. What we have in mind is that it is dangerous to remain silent in times of crisis. Therefore, we have gathered natives from various places in Shanghai, united as one, and vowed to fight a decisive battle with the brutal Japanese. However, in order to resist foreign aggression, we must first put an end to internal strife, so that the battle line will be unified and our strength will be sufficient. You, sirs, have always taken saving the country and the people as your own responsibility. Now that the country is in trouble and the survival of the nation is at stake, we hope that you will uphold the principle of serving the public good, not shirk your responsibility, resolutely sacrifice everything, and unite to deal with foreign enemies. The future of the nation will then have a chance. We present our views directly, and we hope you will understand. The Shanghai Various Native Place Associations Anti-Japanese National Salvation Society bows in respect.</p>
<p>Declaration Released: The association released a declaration, in which it stated the following missions of the association: (1) To awaken those in power to quickly select meritorious generals, whether in office or out of office, and lead elite troops to fight a decisive battle with the brutal Japanese until the goal is achieved; (2) To awaken those who are capable to actively participate in volunteer armies, receive emergency training, and prepare for a protracted war to trap them; (3) To awaken those who are wise to work hard in domestic and foreign propaganda, expose their ambition to conquer step by step, in order to motivate our compatriots and alert friendly nations, and shatter their dream of becoming the masters of East Asia; (4) To awaken those who have wealth to generously donate national salvation funds in order to increase the strength of resistance against Japan and avoid becoming a sequel to the Jewish millionaires; (5) To awaken those who have aspirations to implement economic severance of relations with Japan, never cooperate with them, and never buy enemy goods.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Issued an Important Telegram Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Economic Severance of Relations with Japan Forever. To all compatriots across the country: Unfortunately, our country has suddenly suffered a natural disaster. The banditry has not been eliminated, and the internal strife has not ceased. The barbaric and bestial Japan is taking advantage of our misfortune, launching a large-scale invasion. The provinces of Liaoning and Jilin have all been occupied. They have seized our important places and massacred our officials and civilians, turning our centuries of essence into ashes. The various inhuman acts have already been publicized by various newspapers, so I will not elaborate. Anyone with blood in their veins is filled with righteous indignation. Our association, with the determination to resist Japan and save the country, specially convened a civic assembly for resisting Japan and saving the country on the [unclear] day, resolving to telegraph all compatriots across the country to forever sever economic relations with Japan, vowing not to use Japanese goods. All our compatriots should rise up together, acting in good conscience, vowing to die rather than use Japanese goods. Moreover, the country is in great trouble, and everyone is responsible. At this time of national crisis, our people should unite to resist Japan as a support for the government. Otherwise, the tragedy of national subjugation is imminent, and the sequel to Korea and Taiwan may come soon. It is better to fight to the death with the Japanese invaders than to be slaves of a conquered nation. We hope that our compatriots will persevere to the end, not be tempted by profit, and make a thorough solution to the economic severance of relations with Japan, and safeguard the country in its time of crisis. We specially telegraph this to you and hope you will take note. The Shanghai Citizens' Assembly for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country bows in respect.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Central Government to Severely Punish Treacherous Merchants: To the Central Executive Committee of the National Government in Nanjing: Since the brutal Japanese invaded and Liaoning and Jilin fell, all the people of the country have been filled with righteous indignation. Compatriots from all walks of life, with the ambition that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, have risen up together and enthusiastically resisted enemy goods, expressing their patriotic enthusiasm and saving the country from danger. In addition to working together with one heart and mind to implement it from beginning to end, we should urgently telegraph the Central Government to issue a clear order that if there are treacherous merchants selling enemy goods, they should be punished according to the emergency law for endangering the Republic of China to show their determination. We hereby telegraph this to you and humbly request that you take note of it and implement it. In our urgency, we are eagerly awaiting your orders. The Shanghai Citizens' Assembly for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country bows in respect.</p>
<p>Shoot Wang Zhengting to Appease Public Anger: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: This time, Japan sent troops to the Eastern Provinces and forcibly occupied our territory. The magnitude of the loss is unprecedented in history. When the bad news arrived, the whole country was shocked. This is indeed due to the dereliction of duty of the officials in the Northeast, who are responsible for defending the territory, which caused our Northeast to fall into the hands of the Japanese army. However, it is also due to the weakness shown to the powerful neighbors by Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, who failed to negotiate effectively. The Foreign Minister bears the responsibility for foreign affairs and should have been prudent and impartial in order to protect the Party and the country. However, he perfunctorily dealt with foreign affairs and did not take the national interest as his top priority, which led to the covetousness of powerful neighbors. Insulting the country and derelicting his duties, nothing could be worse. Our association convened a civic assembly for resisting Japan and saving the country on the [unclear] day, resolving to telegraph the Central Government to quickly dismiss and shoot Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, who is cowardly, incompetent, and failed to negotiate effectively, in order to boost national prestige and appease public anger. We hereby telegraph this to you and await your orders with trepidation. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Citizens' Assembly bows in respect.</p>
<p>Endure Hardships and Resist Japan Forever: To all compatriots across the country: Unfortunately, our country has been repeatedly invaded by imperialists. We have endured hardships and swallowed our anger due to the weakness of our national strength, and we have been bound by all kinds of harsh treaties. Today, the imperialists have torn off their mask of false goodwill and are carrying out armed aggression, attacking our Eastern Provinces, destroying our buildings, and massacring our people wherever their troops go. As a result, our 20 million compatriots in the Northeast have all become slaves of a conquered nation, suffering the harshness of the brutal Japanese. They tell us with tears in their eyes that they cannot escape this fate. At this time of national crisis, it is time to endure hardships. All our compatriots should rise up in time and prepare to resist Japan forever in order to seek self-reliance and avoid following in the footsteps of India and Korea. Our association specially convened a civic assembly for resisting Japan and saving the country on the [unclear] day, resolving to advise all compatriots across the country to uphold the determination to love the country, endure hardships, and work hard to improve ourselves. With ten years of effort, it will not be difficult to become strong in the international community. We hope that our compatriots will wash away the national humiliation together. The future of the country is deeply dependent on this. The Shanghai Citizens' Assembly for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country bows in respect.</p>

<p>Important Announcement of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</p>
<h3 id="e134">Deadline for Chinese Compradors of Japanese Companies to Withdraw Within Three Days <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<h3 id="e135">Severely Punish Those Who Mix Japanese Goods with Domestic Goods <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued two urgent announcements yesterday:</p>
<p>The first is an announcement: According to the resolution of the second standing committee meeting of the standing committee of this association, all Chinese compradores of Japanese foreign firms in this city must withdraw from their respective foreign firms within three days from the date of this announcement and register with the association. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be charged with treason. After the original compradores withdraw, no Chinese person is allowed to take over. Otherwise, they will also be given the same punishment, and the investigation department will be handed over to investigate the names and addresses of the compradores for investigation. All parties concerned are requested to register with the association on time and not delay.</p>
<p>The second is to investigate and find that various shops privately transport Japanese goods, often mixed with domestic goods, to avoid inspection. Their intention to smuggle is obvious. At this time of serious situation, how should our merchants inspire their conscience to achieve the actual effect of resistance? Unexpectedly, some merchants smuggle in secret, becoming more and more bizarre. It is the duty of this association to severely punish them. From the date of this announcement, if Japanese goods are mixed with domestic goods again, once discovered, all goods, including domestic goods, will be detained and will not be lenient. This is a special announcement to all shops, and it is very important that you do not make mistakes again.</p>

<p>Proposal of the Hardware Industry Directors' Meeting: The Hardware Industry Association held a directors' meeting the day before yesterday. (1) Chairman Qian Fangzhou first proposed a permanent economic severance with Japan, with no buying or selling. Everyone strongly agreed. If any colleagues violate the resolution in the future and secretly sell to Japan, they are willing to be punished by this association and the anti-Japanese association. This intention will first be announced to all colleagues and those who have not joined the association, with the same methods applied equally. This is a voluntary act by each firm, based on conscience, and as a final sacrifice. The fully authorized representatives of each firm have signed their names and submitted them to the association for preservation, in order to show credibility. (2) Chairman Qian Fangzhou proposed a method for organizing a public warehouse and asked for public discussion. It was resolved that each firm should set aside a room to store all Japanese goods themselves and register the Japanese goods within one week and send them to the association for inspection. The method of supervision and inspection will be discussed again next Monday. If there is any private import of Japanese goods, regardless of who it is, they can report it to the association. If it is verified, the price of the goods will be confiscated, half of which will be stored in the association and half of which will be used as a reward for the reporter. If the report is false, they will also be punished. If the Dunlop goods previously stored and ordered are considered Japanese goods, a detailed number should be reported to the association, and no more orders should be placed in the future. For Western goods ordered from Japanese firms, those that have already been ordered should be delivered, but no more orders should be placed in the future.

<p>Li Jingcong's Suggestions on Five Measures: Li Jingcong telegraphed: "To all newspapers, the national public, and public and private organizations for their consideration. Since the Dwarf Bandits have been rampant, the entire nation has expressed fervent sentiments and formulated sound plans for the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement in both positive and passive aspects. For any omissions, I will not hesitate to offer my humble opinions to supplement them as follows. As it concerns the resistance against Japan and national salvation, I implore the national public and public and private organizations to jointly discuss, supervise, and promote them for their realization, and I will be immensely grateful and offer my blessings." (1) Demand that the National Government, in adhering to the policy of non-resistance, address the responsibility arising from the Japanese army's invasion of our territory and destruction of the existing political system. Before this issue is resolved, the League of Nations should follow the provisions of the covenant to investigate and arbitrate, or the League of Nations should support the Chinese government in adopting self-defense measures and send troops to resolve the situation. Absolutely oppose Shi Zhaoji's request to the League of Nations that, once the Japanese troops are completely withdrawn, the League of Nations can send people to investigate in Manchuria, and his declaration that direct peaceful negotiations can be conducted on the spot. (2) Request the Central Party Headquarters to telegraphically invite influential and powerful party-state figures and military authorities to gather in Shanghai within ten days to jointly discuss national affairs. If the leaders of any region harbor suspicions, are obstinate, or fail to arrive on time, all sectors of society, including farmers, merchants, workers, and businesses in those regions, should immediately go on strike until they are urged to realize their errors and attend, and then resume work. (3) Request all chambers of commerce nationwide to be responsible for searching for Japanese goods, mark the prices according to the cost of each item, and hand them over to the government, which will compensate with disaster relief bonds in equal amounts. All of the goods will then be distributed to disaster victims for use. (4) Request all students nationwide, in addition to strictly adhering to the educational guidelines for the volunteer army announced by the Central Executive Committee on September 24th, also persuade their family members and friends who own Japanese goods to donate them to local disaster relief organizations for distribution to disaster victims for use. (5) Urge the national public to hang flags at half-mast in every household and wear black armbands from this day forward until the restoration of rights and interests in the Northeast and the attribution of responsibility. The black armbands should state "National mourning, uphold the principle of non-cooperation, and practice the policy of rejecting enemy goods" to serve as a reminder and encouragement.

<p>Tung Jen Hospital Nurses Prepare to Depart for the Front Lines:</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese First Aid Volunteer Team of the Nurses' School of Tung Jen Hospital telegraphed: "Recalling that the Japanese Dwarfs have forcibly occupied various districts of our Eastern Provinces with barbaric violence and arbitrarily shot and killed our innocent compatriots, the wickedness of imperialism and its cruel behavior have been fully exposed. The Japanese army is still advancing relentlessly, disregarding China, treating justice as nothing, and ignoring the world's condemnation. Now, the people of our country have reached a point where they can no longer tolerate it and will inevitably engage in a desperate battle. If the front lines are to break out in war, the burden of rear area first aid can be imagined. Recalling that we are also members of the nation and that the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen, how can our patriotic hearts lag behind? Moreover, first aid is our special responsibility, and we cannot stand idly by. It is our unshirkable duty. Therefore, we feel indignant and convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday to jointly discuss methods of first aid. However, we have limited abilities and shallow knowledge, and we hope that all sectors will join us in providing assistance, especially the media to vigorously promote and provide guidance at any time to learn from. In addition to all the students of this school, we have implemented an economic severance with Japan and boycott of Japanese goods from today onwards. This passive method is enough to put the Japanese to death. Although the Dwarf Bandits are strong, they will be powerless. We have also sent letters to nurses in various hospitals at sea to solicit their opinions so that we can concentrate our efforts and jointly seek ways to provide first aid in order to unite and make preparations. We will immediately telegraph the central government to request instructions. If the government needs us, please inform us immediately so that we can depart for the front lines to carry out first aid work and share the national crisis. Even if it means going through fire and water and sacrificing everything, we will not hesitate."</p>

<p>Telegram from the No. 2 District Water and Electricity Industry Union: The No. 2 District Water and Electricity Industry Union sent a telegram yesterday. (Omitted above) In today's situation, the only option is to quickly determine a policy and prepare for war quickly. It is like going through fire and water, and there is no time to hesitate. We hope that the central government and Guangdong will immediately abandon their past grievances and jointly relieve the national crisis. We hope that the public officials in the Northeast will atone for their crimes and that Zhan Tangtongzhi will resume his duties after his leave. We hope that all compatriots will form volunteer armies with planning, organization, and training to be the backbone of the central government, obey national deployment, resist this tyrannical and violent Japan, and save our endangered China. This is the only way to recover our territory, compensate for our losses, and eliminate their delusion of the Manchu-Mongol policy. Taiwan Remnant People's Association Telegram: Commander-in-Chief Jiang of Nanjing, Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping, Committee Member Wang of Guangzhou, and all party, government, and military officials: "Taiwan Province was ceded due to defeat in war, sacrificing the lives of four million compatriots to the enemy to alleviate the nation's emergency. We have been slaves for forty years, hoping that our motherland would rise and avenge our humiliation so we can see the light of day. Unfortunately, we suddenly heard that the Japanese bandits had sent troops to occupy Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Our ten million compatriots in Liaoning and Jilin provinces will again become slaves of the Japanese invaders. Alas, what a tragedy! The clouds and mountains are in sight. We implore all of you in the motherland to abandon your personal opinions, unite, and declare war on the Japanese bandits immediately. It is better to be shattered jade than an intact tile. Although Taiwan was ceded in the past, the people of Taiwan still established a democratic country and resisted the Japanese invaders for many years, killing nearly ten thousand Japanese. Today, the national spirit is available, and national power is reliable. Please do not beg foreigners or talk about calmness and non-resistance. Although the Taiwanese people are clumsy, they are willing to rise up as support. Otherwise, today it is one province, tomorrow it will be another province, leading four hundred million compatriots to be enslaved by the barbarians. What hope can we Taiwanese have?" The Taiwan Remnant People's Association respectfully implores with tears and gratitude.</p>

<p>The All-Shanghai Korean Residents' Congress issued a declaration, stating: "The so-called Japanese Empire of today is the remnant of Japanese pirates, inherently accustomed to piracy. Starting from the era of Luo Tang, they repeatedly invaded the Korean and Chinese coasts. During the seasons of Li Zhu, they dared to invade under the pretext of passing through. Fortunately, with the Allied forces, they were completely defeated in one swoop. Since the Sino-Japanese War, they have taken advantage of our troubles to exploit the Central Plains. During the Gengxu period, they took advantage of our lack of assistance to annex our country. Their policies after annexing Korea, such as the Manchurian-Mongolian policy, including the resettlement of 200,000 Japanese, the construction of over 4,000 li of railways, the investment of 1.5 billion yuan, and the permanent stationing of tens of thousands of troops, are all preparations for annexing the mainland. They dare not advance into the Northeast because of the difficulty in breaking the balance of power and hindering their monopoly. Like a praying mantis catching a cicada, they fear the oriole lurking behind. They see the European situation and are eager to save themselves, having no time to look east. Furthermore, the situation in China is strained by internal strife, requiring careful planning. With the addition of devastating floods and widespread fires, natural disasters and human calamities are believed to be exploitable opportunities. They reveal their ferocious faces and resort to treacherous tricks. They move troops in the dark of night, attacking cities and plundering towns. Within days, they occupy Liaoning and Jilin. The cruelty of burning, looting, and plundering is even worse than that of Zhu Mao. The area of massacre and occupation is even greater than the previous Russian disaster. Trampling on neighboring countries as if there were no one else around, they violate treaties without the slightest hesitation. They have made the 30 million people of the Northeast prisoners and transformed thousands of miles of Chinese territory into a colony. The two million Korean residents are about to be placed in a deadly situation. The threat to the Korean-Chinese border is the greatest it has ever been. The life-or-death opportunity for East Asia is now imminent. Alas, they, with thousands of years of enmity between Korea and China, now act as the enemy of both nations. This is not only for the sake of both countries but also as traitors to all the nations of East Asia. Not only are they traitors to East Asia, but they also enable the world to see them as robbers and recognize them as common enemies. We, in order to avenge the Three Hans and restore our country, for the sake of China's righteous defense and the clearing of shame, for the sake of eliminating traitors in East Asia, and for the sake of the international community and humanity to eliminate robbers and eradicate common enemies, pledge to rise up with the determined soldiers of the Three Hans, wielding our swords, and are willing to join the battle lines with the heroes of China to eradicate those villains. Moreover, they are facing opposition between Satchang, labor-management conflicts, the early signs of their collapse, harsh taxes, and the people living in misery. People sing the lament of perishing together. Furthermore, there are 20 million Koreans who want to devour their flesh. The friendly nations of the world have enumerated their crimes. Their wickedness has reached its peak, and they cannot escape the net of heaven. Public anger has been provoked, and their downfall is imminent. It is the time for the brave men of Korea and China to sharpen their horses and soar into the sky, no longer the time to endure and lie low. May our friendly nation's warriors rise up in unison, slaughter the boars in Liaojie, and slay the long snakes in Qingqiu. This declaration is respectfully made on September 25th of the 13th year of the Republic of Korea, by the All-Korean Residents' Congress."</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese are Admirable for Their Willingness to Donate</p>
<p>This time, the flood disaster in our country has affected as many as sixteen provinces. The people in the country have risen up to actively seek relief, and the overseas Chinese are even more concerned. They enthusiastically raise donations and remit funds to China. For example, the Xinmin Daily News Agency in the Philippines, due to the lack of a large-scale disaster relief organization in the overseas Chinese community, initiated an automatic donation campaign for disaster relief. The funds were collected by the Zhongxing Bank and the Xinmin Daily. Later, with the establishment of the Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce's Chinese Flood Relief Association, the campaign concluded. Although it only lasted for six days, the donations raised amounted to over 14,300 national currency dollars. All of it has been remitted to the National Government's Flood Relief Committee. Its outstanding achievements are due to the strong advocacy of the initiators, such as Li Qingquan, Xue Minlao, Xu Youchao of the Zhongxing Bank, and Wu Bansheng of the Xinmin Daily, and others. Following this, the Chinese Flood Relief Association in the Philippines has successively remitted a total of 150,000 yuan for disaster relief. The overseas Chinese in various places have been inspired and are happy to make contributions. Their concern for the motherland and their sympathy for the disaster-stricken areas, considering the hunger and drowning as their own, are admirable from afar. Not only do the surviving children of the disaster area sing their praises endlessly.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Meeting of the Flood Relief Associations of Various Provinces</p>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for the Floods in Various Provinces held its tenth standing committee meeting yesterday at 4 PM. Attendees included Qu Wenliu, Xu Shiying, Wu Zhihao, Wang Xiaolai, Wen Lanting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Huang Hanzhi, Ha Shaofu, Mao Xifeng, Yu Zhiang, Chen Zhenfu, Zhu Qiluo, Zhu Ziqiao, Jin Guanfu, Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Weng Guoxun), Pan Gongzhan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Minggang, Huang Wenzhi representing Hankou, Wang Qi and Yang Jiong representing Hunan, and Li Hengzhang representing northern Anhui, among others. Xu Shiying chaired the meeting, and Yang Yunqin recorded the minutes. There were 219 items on the agenda. Representatives from Hunan, Hankou, and northern Anhui reported on the disaster situation in their respective areas. Zhou Minggang reported on the current situation of the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Victims Reception Center and requested an additional allocation of 50,000 yuan to continue its maintenance. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) Upon receiving telegrams from Special Commissioner Xu requesting expedited allocation of funds to address the deficit in Qianshan, Taihu, Liuan, and Shucheng counties in Anhui Province, totaling 24,000 yuan. It was noted that the eighth and ninth standing committee meetings had already allocated 13,000 yuan in foreign currency. The question of whether to expedite the allocation of the remaining 11,000 yuan was decided by public vote to allocate the 11,000 yuan. (2) Regarding the previous report by Mr. Li, the leader of the task force, regarding the disaster relief work, with the association's funds specifically allocated for group operations in Echeng, Huanggang, Daye, and Huangpi counties in Hubei Province, estimated to require 160,000 yuan per month, totaling 320,000 yuan for two months. With 80,000 yuan already allocated, there was a shortfall of 240,000 yuan. The question of how to proceed was decided to allocate 30,000 yuan first. (3) An inquiry regarding the decision made at the first standing committee meeting to purchase 10,000 bags of No. 2 flour and 10,000 bags of No. 3 flour. Subsequently, as No. 2 flour was deemed unsuitable for disaster relief, it was changed to 10,000 bags of No. 4 flour, with the Suzhou Relief Association undertaking to purchase 5,000 bags of No. 4 flour. There are currently 5,000 bags of No. 4 flour and 10,000 bags of No. 3 flour remaining, and it is urgent to ship them after two months. The question of how to distribute them was decided to allocate 5,000 bags of No. 4 flour for relief in Funing and 10,000 bags of No. 3 flour for relief in Anhui. The price of the flour should be paid based on its value. (4) An inquiry regarding the request from the Shanghai Municipal Reception Center for an allocation of 50,000 yuan. The question of whether to approve the allocation was decided to allocate 20,000 yuan first. (5) The question of how to distribute the relief clothing was decided to allocate 12,000 sets of clothing and pants for relief in northern Jiangsu and 3,000 sets of clothing and pants, 363 cotton quilts, and 303 items of shoes, hats, and socks for relief in Jiangning. (6) It was decided to hold a commemorative group photo session for all standing committee members at the Mingxing Film Company on Dumei Road at 2 PM on the 6th of the month (Tuesday). The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Municipal Government's Disaster Relief Campaign Measures</p>
<p>Letter to the Flood Relief Association Seeking Deliberation and Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government sent a letter to the Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association, stating, "It has been found that the flood situation in various provinces is extremely tragic. In order to arouse public attention and encourage donations, a disaster relief campaign is essential and cannot be delayed. We have reviewed the key measures proposed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for the disaster relief campaign and find them largely adoptable. We are therefore sending a summary to your association, hoping that you will deliberate and implement them to broaden publicity and facilitate relief efforts. Attached is a summary of the disaster relief campaign measures." The disaster relief campaign measures include: (1) Objective: To enable all citizens to understand the magnitude of the disaster in the provinces and the suffering of the people in the disaster areas, to arouse their compassion and desire to provide relief, and to achieve the goal of relieving the victims of the disaster. (2) Implementation: Starting from both publicity and fundraising. (A) Publicity Methods: (1) Illustrations and Advertisements: Invite famous artists or solicit from painters to depict the tragic scenes of the disaster areas, accompanied by alarming words. Make zinc plates about the size of one-quarter of a full newspaper page (i.e., one-half of a page) and publish them in various newspapers. (Explanation) Illustrations are most moving, and the addition of concise and alarming words, especially from the hands of famous people, will more easily attract attention. The effect will be deeper than general poster advertisements. (2) Illustrated Publications: Collect photographs of the disaster areas, along with the illustrated advertisements from various newspapers, and add a colored cover to compile them into a booklet. Distribute them through various bookstores and news vendors. (3) Disaster Situation Reports: The purpose of the disaster situation reports currently in the newspapers is to publish as much information as possible. However, lengthy and repetitive reports lack practical guidance and statistical charts, failing to move people deeply and causing fatigue. It is proposed that the various relief agencies use maps to show the scope of the disaster areas in various provinces, indicating the amount of farmland in a particular county, the amount submerged, the number of people affected, the amount of donations distributed, and the situation of seeking refuge and displacement. Efforts should be made to avoid the "report of disaster" style of writing and instead adopt a descriptive approach, still publishing them separately in various newspapers. If they can be compiled in a novel way, they will be more effective than the current publicity methods. (4) School Publicity: School principals and teachers should lecture students daily on the disaster situation and the importance of mutual assistance and relief, so that they can relay the information to their families. Children and young people are more easily moved by emotions, and the effect is more significant than lecturing in public places. (5) Industrial and Commercial Sector Publicity: In the industrial sector, each factory will be used as a unit, and the responsible personnel of each labor union will be responsible for publicizing the disaster situation, giving lectures, and soliciting donations. The commercial sector should be divided into groups, such as the banking group, the money trade group, and the silk and satin industry group, etc., with the responsible personnel of each industry association responsible for publicity. (6) Family Publicity: Women's organizations, such as the YWCA, the Women's Relief Association, the Women's National Products Promotion Association, and the Women's Temperance Association, etc., should send personnel to give lectures and solicit donations. (B) Fundraising Methods: (1) Issuance of Commemorative Badges: It has been found that fundraising is exhausted without other methods. It is now proposed to issue Shanghai Municipal Disaster Relief Commemorative Badges (or Shanghai Citizen Disaster Relief Commemorative Badges), which are exquisitely carved and beautiful in design. The cost is about one yuan to one yuan and five dimes each. Except for badges numbered 1 to 10, which will be disposed of separately, the rest will be sold for five yuan each. The intention of issuing this badge is: (1) It is exquisitely made and people of all nationalities are happy to buy it as a souvenir. (2) Having this badge can avoid the trouble of being solicited for donations along the way (this must be announced before the issuance). (3) This badge can be distributed to Chinese and foreign organizations, institutions, churches, or various stores for consignment sales. If handled properly, several hundred thousand yuan in donations can be easily collected after deducting costs. The commemorative badges numbered 1 to 10 can be sold publicly through auction. A grand meeting should be held on a selected date, inviting people from all walks of life, Chinese and foreign, to participate in the auction, with the highest bidder winning. Under the enthusiastic atmosphere at the time, these ten badges alone may be able to raise a huge amount of donations. If the amount of such donations raised exceeds 100,000 yuan, 30% can be used as a municipal storage fund. Or, at the beginning of the fundraising, it should be declared that a certain percentage will be used as a municipal storage fund to maintain the people's livelihood, in which case the name of the commemorative badge should be changed to "Shanghai Municipal Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Commemorative Badge." (2) Citywide Fundraising: It is proposed not to take the form of roadside fundraising to avoid obstructing pedestrians, but to adopt a door-to-door fundraising approach to ensure no one is missed. "Methods: (a) The city will be divided into several districts, and each district will be further divided into several sections, assigned to schools or commercial organizations (including the foreign concessions). (b) The date of fundraising in a certain district and the names of the fundraisers will be announced in advance. (c) Each fundraiser will be given a symbol. (d) Donation tickets will be printed in denominations of two dimes, four dimes, six dimes, eight dimes, and one yuan. For example, if the donation is two yuan, two one-yuan donation tickets will be given. The rest can be inferred by analogy. (e) Fundraising in each district must be completed within one or two days. Fundraising will not be allowed after the deadline. The difficulties in handling this matter are: (1) Cumbersome procedures. (2) Difficult distribution. (3) Difficult management. (4) Difficult to collect funds. (5) Large expenses. However, the results obtained are also the greatest. (C) Other Parties: It is planned to convene various groups such as actors, storytellers, performers, and the film industry to instruct them to plan how to assist."</p>
<p>Request for Disaster Relief from Ju County, Henan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association received the following telegram from Ju County, Henan (excerpt): "Ju County is located in a remote corner with a low-lying terrain. The Ersi Wo and Er River flow directly through it. The suffering of the military disaster last year was the worst in all of Henan. The total loss of property was over four million, and the casualties exceeded two thousand. The vitality of the people has been greatly damaged, and the livelihood of the disaster victims has been cut off. We were hoping for this year's autumn harvest to provide some recovery, but before the flames of war had cooled, the disaster of water deepened. Since the beginning of July, there have been continuous days of rain, and it has not cleared for half a month. Extending to the end of the month, the torrential rain poured down non-stop for seven days and nights, causing the riverbanks to burst simultaneously. The water overflowed and flowed horizontally, and travel was only possible by boat. Looking around the area, it was a vast expanse of water. All the good land has become a watery country. People, livestock, and crops have been washed away. Rice, food, and belongings have been swept away, and it is difficult to count the collapsed houses. Those who died have long been water gods, and those who live depend on buildings and have no land. Moaning and calling for help, the situation is unbearable to hear. Rolling in ditches, the scene is unbearable to see. Alas, our small and remote county has experienced a disaster that has not occurred in hundreds of years. After the great military disaster, there followed the great flood. Old and new wounds followed one after another. Bearing the pain, our hearts and livers are broken. What crime have the people of Ju committed to repeatedly suffer such misfortune? First they died in battle, then they died by drowning. As we approach the turn of autumn and winter, without clothing or shelter, they will surely die from cold and starvation. It is truly tragic! If we do not provide immediate relief, I fear that the remnants after the disaster will all perish together. Alas, when the Great Yu passed away, who will guide the flood eastward? Ji An is no longer here, who will distribute grain from the granaries to relieve the people? The district heads and others witness this disaster and their hearts are pounding. They want to plan relief, but they have no rice to cook, making it difficult to cope. They want to appeal for righteous relief, but a cup of water to a cart of firewood is insufficient, and distribution is difficult. They wander around at midnight, not knowing what to do. The need for relief is urgent. We dare to rely on the compassionate heart of your association, acting on behalf of the 330,000 mourning people, making a Geng Gui appeal. We implore you to have mercy on the disaster-stricken area and the people who have suffered disaster after disaster, and quickly allocate a large amount of relief funds, or widely distribute benevolent gruel and righteous grain, to save the dying ants, so that the good and docile people of eastern Henan will not be extinct. Then, the dead and the living will be grateful forever. We are overwhelmed with urgency, eagerly awaiting your order. Li Hongrui, District Head of the First District of Ju County; Wang Shuan, District Head of the Second District; Yang Zhizhong, District Head of the Third District; Yin Chengen, District Head of the Fourth District; Cao Fangting, District Head of the Fifth District; Xu Qibin, District Head of the Sixth District; together...."</p>
<p>The Jisheng Association Distributes Seeds</p>
<p>The local Chinese Jisheng Association is currently implementing relief efforts in Huaiyin, Gang'an, and Si'an counties in northern Jiangsu, which has been reported previously. According to Mr. Li Yushu, the head of the relief efforts in Huaiyin and other counties, the disaster situation in the Second District of Huaiyin, the Third District of Siyang, and the western townships of Huai'an is extremely serious. The water has receded and replanting is possible. Relief funds have been allocated to purchase relief flour, seeds, and other items. The relief flour has been transported to the disaster areas for emergency relief. Due to insufficient relief funds, an additional 5,000 yuan in foreign currency has been allocated to Mr. Li Yushu to expedite the purchase and distribution of seeds. According to a recent telegram, over 1,000 stones of wheat seeds have been purchased at a price of seven yuan per stone and will be distributed in Siyang tomorrow. The association believes that replanting after the floodwaters recede is an effective way to provide thorough relief.</p>

<p>Sailors Rescued in Shanghai for the Second Time</p>
<p>Chinese Sailors Rescue Three People</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Accident</p>
<p>The Japanese salvage ship "Fourteen Maru", which was salvaging the Yangtze River steamer, encountered a strong wind and was wrecked. All the sailors and technicians on board fell into the sea. Two Chinese sailors, Gu Boshun and others, were rescued by the "Sherpis"轮 and reported in this newspaper. The other fourteen people were missing. Yesterday, the captain of the ship, Mr. Fujii, was brought back to Shanghai by our Chuanshan Company's "Chuanshan" ship. It is reported that three of the four Chinese who fell into the sea have been rescued, and three Japanese divers have also survived. Yesterday, Fujii came to Shanghai and recounted the tragic details of the incident, which are worth recording. They are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>After Falling into the Sea: The Yangtze River steamer sank off the coast of Beiyushan. The "Fourteen Maru" went to rescue it and arrived at the location. At 10 pm on September 24th, a hurricane rose up. The ship was blown onto a hidden reef. The hull was broken, and all sixteen people on board fell into the sea. At the time, the captain, the diver Yamamoto, and three Chinese sailors, fearing they would be separated in the sea, tied themselves together with their belts. They initially planned to go to the Beiyushan lighthouse for help. After one night, on the morning of the 25th, everyone's belts broke, and they were washed to the shore of a giant island. They then planned to climb the mountain. Because they were climbing a precipice, Fujii and the Chinese and Japanese sailors were carried by the waves to the foot of an island. They were overjoyed, thinking they could be rescued. They shouted for help loudly at the foot of the mountain, but they did not expect that there were no people on the island. Opposite the Beiyushan lighthouse, they could not think of a solution. They had no choice but to climb up the mountain first. The base of the mountain was mostly sharp clam shells, and the hands and feet of the group were all broken and injured. Everyone exerted all their strength, and with great difficulty, after two or three hours, they were able to climb up the precipice and seek help again. Russian Assistance: Fujii and the Chinese deckhands reached the top of the mountain and used torn clothing to signal for help to the Beiyushan lighthouse. The watchmen at the lighthouse saw them. The two Russian lighthouse keepers at Beiyushan devised a way to use a small sampan to reach the island and rescued everyone from the top of the mountain. Then, they were taken to Beiyushan, given food, and waited for a ship back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chuanshan Brings Them: On the 28th, the Chuanshan Company's "Chuanshan" ship passed by the area. After the Beiyushan lighthouse sent out a distress signal, the "Chuanshan" ship stopped and sent a sampan to the lighthouse to rescue everyone onto the ship and take them to Shipu. The three Chinese sailors who were rescued are currently staying in Shipu. The Japanese technicians and the captain took the original ship to Shanghai. According to Fujii, he saw two of his colleagues being swept into the center of the sea by a wave and then sinking to the bottom. It has now been confirmed that eight Japanese and one Chinese have died.</p>

<p>A Young Girl Suddenly Loses Consciousness</p>
<p>Wang Dongmei is Ashamed to Return Home</p>
<p>She Continues to Stay in a Hotel for Several Days</p>
<p>The Husband's Family is Unwilling to Marry Her Again</p>
<p>Shen Aru is Accused of Absconding</p>
<p>Wang Qiu, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 811 Tangjia Lane, Qipu Road, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Shen Aru, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 774 Guiren Lane, Qipu Road, and his sister Chen Amao of raping her daughter Wang Dongmei. Yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi held a trial in the Second Criminal Court. Only the defendant Chen Amao appeared in court. Shen Aru was represented by his father, A Wu, who appeared in court to respond to the lawsuit. According to Wang Qiu's statement, on the afternoon of the 22nd day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar at 3 PM, her daughter Dongmei went to her mother's house on Baoshan Road. However, she did not return for two nights. After inquiring with her co-worker, she was told that Dongmei had not come. Knowing that her daughter had been abducted, she searched everywhere and finally found her at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road on the 25th. She learned that she had been raped by Aru. Now, Dongmei's husband's family is unwilling to marry her again, so she has filed a lawsuit. According to Wang Dongmei's statement, she is 17 years old. On the 22nd, she passed by the entrance of Guiren Lane on her way to her mother's house. She happened to meet the defendant Chen Amao. Chen invited her to watch a movie and took her to the entrance of the Phoenix Hotel. Chen pretended to go buy tickets and never returned. Later, her younger brother Shen Aru took her to Room 208 of the hotel.</p>
<p>There were already many of Aru's friends there. She sat on the bed waiting for Amao to come. In the evening, Aru called for a table of food to be brought to the room. His friends forced her to drink wine. She refused, but they forced her to drink one cup. She didn't know what was in the wine, but after drinking it, she felt dizzy. Aru's friends completely took off her clothes and hid them. She lost consciousness. When she woke up, she saw red stains on her pants. Aru told her to wash them off. Because she was ashamed to go home, she had to stay with him at the Phoenix Hotel for two days and then moved to the Xizang Hotel for one night. Later, her mother found her at the China Hotel. Aru was caught by her mother. Now, her mother, brother, and fiancé do not want to keep her, so she has no choice but to come out and file a lawsuit. Shen A Wu testified that on the 7th of this month, the plaintiffs led many people to his house and beat them up. His son Aru ran away at that time and his life and death are unknown, so he could not appear in court to respond to the lawsuit. When Chen Amao was questioned, she completely denied all the accusations made by the plaintiffs. Judge Wu verified the testimonies and ordered a postponement of the hearing to summon Shen Aru for further questioning.</p>

<p>Another Property Dispute Arises</p>
<p>The Half-Brother of the Stepmother Occupies the Family Property</p>
<p>Wenqing's Biological Mother Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, who, in the winter of the year before last, murdered her stepmother Zhang Su with her lover, had her death sentence revoked by the second instance court and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Zhang is still not satisfied and is currently appealing to the third instance court. Presently, her biological mother Ms. (name omitted) is litigating against the brother of the deceased Zhang Su regarding this case. The cause of the dispute is as follows: Zhang Wenqing's father, Zhang Rongxiang, was previously a county magistrate. He was originally from Huzhou. After retiring from office, he took his family and resided in Shanghai at No. 762 Carter Road. Rongxiang's legal wife, Su, only gave birth to two daughters. The younger daughter is already married, and the elder is Wenqing. The concubine who was also named Su, i.e., the one murdered by Wenqing, gave birth to two sons named Wenquan and Wenji, one thirteen years old and the other only eleven. When Rongxiang was alive, all the savings from his official career were deposited in the bank. Because the legal wife was weak and sickly, the household affairs were managed by the concubine. Therefore, all the deposit slips were also in the concubine's possession. When Rongxiang died, the wife and concubine had a dispute over the management of the household affairs and litigated in court. However, they soon reconciled out of court. When Wenqing murdered her stepmother the year before last, her biological mother, Zhang Su, began to investigate her deceased husband's estate. In addition to the two thousand tael deposit slip submitted to the court in Wenqing's murder case, there was also a three thousand tael deposit slip in the Zhang Xiangji account at the Siming Bank, which had been missing for a long time. This Ms. Zhang Su did not engage a lawyer and petition the first special district court this summer to order the Siming Bank to freeze the account. After the special court officially announced the order, Su Xiaoting, the brother of the deceased Zhang Su, filed a statement with the special court, declaring that he was acting as the agent for his two nephews, Wenquan and Wenji, and that the deposit slip was actually owned by the two nephews. The special court, based on the statement, stated that since there was a dispute, the Ms. Zhang Su was instructed to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law and await judgment. Lawyer Wu then represented the Ms. Zhang Su in filing a lawsuit against Su Xiaoting, detailing the circumstances of the defendant's attempt to seize the family property under the pretext that the plaintiff suffered from mental illness and had no capacity to manage the estate. The plaintiff, although occasionally suffering from dizziness, was only suffering from a common minor illness and should not be regarded as mentally incompetent. Wenquan and Wenji are both minors, and the plaintiff is the legal wife of the deceased Zhang Rongxiang, so the estate of the deceased husband should be managed by the plaintiff in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The savings accumulated by the deceased husband during his lifetime were not much. In addition to the two thousand tael deposit slip from Wenqing's murder case, which is stored in the court, there is no other property. If this three thousand yuan deposit is also seized, how will she live in the future? Therefore, she asks the court to rule that the plaintiff has the right to manage the estate. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Shouyi opened the Seventh Civil Court, summoned both parties for questioning, and ordered a postponement for further verification.</p>

At 2 PM, Criminal Court President Xu Dingzhi, together with Judges Wu and Xiao, ascended the bench of Criminal Court One to announce the judgment. The main text of the judgment stated: The original judgment regarding Sun Yunqing's innocence and the dismissal of the incidental civil lawsuit is revoked. Sun Yunqing is fined fifty yuan for injuring a person's body. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be sentenced to imprisonment for one day for every two yuan.

<p>Lai Fu, the adopted daughter of Xiong Fei, a judge in the Civil Court of the Special District Court, ran away from home because she could not bear the abuse of the head of the household. She borrowed a house and cohabited with Shen An'nan. Later, Xiong Fei's wife reported to the police station, and Shen and the girl were arrested and sent to court. Shen was sentenced to six months in prison. Shen refused to accept the original judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. After several inquiries, the debate concluded on September 25. The sentence was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday, but because the circumstances of the case still needed investigation, Song Yuanting announced that the investigation and trial would be scheduled again.</p>

<p>The Customs General Tax Department, in view of the increasing number of Chinese and foreign books on Chinese economics and industry collected by the department over the years, and the fact that those outside the department who study Chinese economics and industry often lament the lack of adequate reference materials, specially requested the Customs Affairs Department last year to move the stored books to a new building and assign a special commissioner to prepare for the opening of a free reference library to the public. The Customs Affairs Department approved the request and agreed to allocate a large sum of money annually for maintenance, with the aim of making it the largest reference library in China in the future. Since last year, the library has been actively preparing for the construction and internal and external equipment, which has been completed. Recently, the library has been widely collecting Chinese and foreign books on Chinese economics and industry to enrich the library. For the convenience of all sectors of society, it is reported that it will be open to the public on National Day.

<p>(Question: How can women join the anti-Japanese and save-the-nation movement?)</p>
<p>I am a young girl. Since graduating from junior high school earlier this year, I have not continued to transfer to another school. Recently, I have heard about the atrocities of the violent Japanese, and I am extremely heartbroken. However, I am not in school and do not know how to participate in the anti-Japanese movement. I am very sad. Now, I would like to ask you, how should we women serve the country? How should we deal with foreign enemies? Can we go to the front lines to help in the war? Besides propaganda, are there other ways to make compatriots more enthusiastic about loving the country? Please advise us. I would be grateful.</p>
<p>(Reply) Women have a very important responsibility in this anti-Japanese and save-the-nation movement, which is to persuade neighbors, relatives, and friends not to buy Japanese goods at all. On the one hand, they should set an example by not using Japanese goods at all, whether it is for eating, using, or wearing. For example, on the first day, if you can persuade nine people not to buy Japanese goods, then you will have ten people. On the second day, if each person persuades nine more people, that will be one hundred people. Using this method, you can get one thousand people on the third day, ten thousand people on the fourth day, one hundred thousand people on the fifth day, and one million people on the sixth day. Wouldn't you get ten million people in one week? As long as one person is willing to take the lead, and if women take the initiative to start in the home, it will be especially practical and effective. I hope you will quickly unite your comrades and work hard. Zhang Chaojun Asks (Question: The situation of the volunteer army.)</p>
<p>I am a young man who hates the Japanese devils. Since I was six years old, I have felt uncomfortable as soon as I saw the Japanese bandits. As I grew older, my knowledge gradually expanded, and I learned about the tyrannical behavior of the Japanese dogs, killing my compatriots and seizing my land. From then on, my hatred has grown deeper day by day. Until now, I really want to swallow their flesh raw. I have repeatedly wanted to join the army and use my blood to wash away the shame of the mountains and rivers. Unfortunately, my country's officials are all shrinking back and using excuses to calmly await the public judgment of the League of Nations. Now, the true face of the League of Nations has been completely exposed, but the government has not shown any sign of responding. This is truly incomprehensible. In particular, there are many compatriots who are indifferent to national affairs. While you are resentful here, they are leisurely going to the cinema, going to the dance hall, and eating big meals. There are also many unscrupulous merchants who take advantage of the opportunity to make profits and smuggle enemy goods by any means. When national disaster strikes, it is simply someone else's business. Wanting them to go to the front lines together is like carrying Mount Tai to cross the North Sea. Alas, are their ancestors not Chinese? Sir, I really want to abandon this evil world. But I think dying like this is very unwilling. I want to kill a few Japanese bandits with my own hands before I can close my eyes. Now I hear that many enthusiastic compatriots are organizing volunteer armies. I can't help but cheer enthusiastically, celebrating the hope of the motherland's revival. I really want to join the army, but I don't know the purpose of this volunteer army. Is it to go to the battlefield immediately to serve and kill enemies to save the country? And can it exist permanently, until China becomes strong? I have been deceived enough by those five-minute-heat friends, so this time I dare not rashly go and enlist. Sir, can you tell me?</p>
<p>(Reply) The volunteer army is very good. It uses the patriotic blood as the glue to unite thousands of compatriots. It uses military training to unite thousands of people to be human. It also uses science as their tool to increase production and make them economically secure. Its heat is naturally irresistible. This time, forced by the facts, the people's anger has reached this point, so I don't think it will be a flash in the pan. Get up, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Wencai Asks</p>
<p>(Question: How to solve the problem of family members preventing me from joining the volunteer corps?)</p>
<p>Although I am a student who has not yet completed my studies, I have a bit of enthusiasm for the survival of the country. I have long wanted to join the volunteer corps to do my best for the country. When I consulted with my family, who knew that not only did they not approve of my request, but they also accused me of being foolish and said that the existence or non-existence of the country cannot be saved by your individual. If we, as citizens, all have this kind of negative attitude and irresponsible talk, then what hope is there for the existence of the country? Therefore, I would like to ask the gentlemen reporters to think of a suitable way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>(Reply) You should tell your family about the unprecedented tyrannical behavior of Japan this time, the degree of danger to the country's future, the irreparable disasters after the country is destroyed, and the misery of the extermination of the race. Tell them in a very sincere and earnest way about the spirit of unity and courage that the masses have shown this time. I think your family will definitely be moved.</p>

<p>— Cuckoo</p>
<p>Dear compatriots. Yesterday, didn't I say that our non-resistance policy towards Japan seems to imitate India's non-violent resistance? Who knew that an Indian friend came to protest to me, saying, "Our non-violent resistance is actually a powerful resistance under the leadership of Mr. Gandhi, but it just doesn't use force. But your country's non-resistance is really just submitting to humiliation and never resisting. How can it be compared to our non-violent resistance? If you continue to not resist like this without other powerful methods of defending against the enemy, then your country will become the second India. I'm afraid you won't even qualify." I quickly apologized to him and painfully wrote it out. Please everyone calmly think about it.</p>

<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>This time, the violent Japanese slaughtered compatriots in the Northeast. The news spread and people all over the country were pained and indignant. Tracing back to before the Sino-Japanese War, Japan was a small country. All countries in the world looked down on its weakness. But it unexpectedly won against the great China, and then won against the powerful Russia. Japan's international status increased a lot because of this. The war between China and Japan was not because Japan was stronger than China, but because China's generals and soldiers were greedy for life and afraid of death and unwilling to fight hard. In this campaign, the one who took the lead in charging was Han Shichang. When the two armies were at war, the Japanese battleship formed a straight line formation in the Yalu River. There were more than thirty Chinese warships. Mr. Han took the lead and charged in one warship. It was three or forty miles apart from the warship led by the navy admiral, and the warships on both wings were also more than ten miles apart. Therefore, after contact, the shells fired by the Japanese warships all hit the Zhiyuan warship led by Han Shichang. In less than an hour, two or thirty holes had been pierced all over the ship. It was about to sink. About sixty or seventy soldiers in the ship, at this critical moment, seeing that reinforcements from the rear did not arrive, knew that they would die. So they said to their subordinates, "In another two hours, the ship will sink. We will all die. Why not open the engines to their full power and charge towards the enemy warship, destroying its center." Once the decision was made, the ship rushed forward, crashing through the main ship of the Japanese navy. Both ships sank at the same time. Han (Shichang), after falling into the water, held his two beloved dogs in his hands, so he did not sink. He floated on the sea, and peered at the sinking of Chinese and Japanese warships through his telescope. Then he looked back at the flag of the Chinese army to see if they would come to rescue. At this time, the Japanese fleet, in the Yalu River, had no leader of the central battleship. The soldiers were about to raise a white flag and announce their surrender. At this time, the Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese warships had not advanced, aimed their cannons at the flag of the central army and bombarded it. The flag of the central army was hit and broken. The navy admiral Ding Ruchang was shocked and did not raise the flag of the central army again. So the warships on both wings, seeing that the flag of the central army had fallen, all fled. Han (Shichang), in the water, also did not see the flag of the central army, and thought that the Chinese warships had all been defeated. So he abandoned his two beloved dogs and died in the water. At that time, if the Chinese navy had all been as loyal and brave as Han Shichang, the Japanese army would have been defeated. But Fang Boqian and the foreign general Hannergen fled one after another. Ding Ruchang had no plan and was eventually surrounded by the Japanese warships. Ding also committed suicide by taking poison in Liugong Island to die for his country. The Chinese army and navy were completely defeated as a result. If China had not been defeated in this campaign, the Japanese would not dare to look down on China today.</p>

<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>The Japanese army invaded the Eastern Provinces, committing wanton massacres. The shocking news spread, and the entire country was filled with anger. From the intellectual class to the common laborers, everyone rose up and vowed to devote themselves to the national crisis. The fervor of the people's spirit was unprecedented. Here are some brief notes of what I have heard and seen in recent days. This may also indicate a glimpse of the people's spirit.</p>
<p>Shop Assistants Initiate National Salvation Savings</p>
<p>With the national crisis at hand, personal property is no longer secure. People with lofty ideals are willing to destroy their homes to alleviate the difficulties. Colleagues at the China Chemical Industry Company in this city initiated a national salvation savings plan. One person proposed it, and the shop's staff all contributed generously, collecting several hundred yuan to be deposited in the bank for safekeeping, to be used for military expenses in case of a declaration of war against Japan. Now that the clouds of war are pressing closer every day, once war breaks out, weapons and military supplies will be needed everywhere. It is deeply hoped that more people will follow suit with this national salvation savings plan, so that gathering sand into a tower and collecting drops into a fur coat, it may not be impossible to provide some assistance to the government's military efforts.</p>
<p>Employees of the Japanese Consulate Resign</p>
<p>After the Shenyang Incident, Chinese employees who were subservient to the Japanese adopted a non-cooperative attitude and voluntarily resigned. At the Japanese Consulate in Hangzhou, more than ten Chinese employees have now all resigned, vowing never to serve the Japanese. Their patriotic spirit is worthy of praise. As a result, the Japanese consul stationed in Hangzhou falsely claimed to feel unsafe and temporarily left the consulate to take refuge in Shanghai, according to reports.</p>

<p>A female student named Shen Jingjuan, studying at a school in western Shanghai, felt endlessly indignant upon hearing of the Japanese atrocities in recent days.

Rather be a broken jade than an unbroken tile." After writing the sixteen characters, she suddenly fainted. By the time her family noticed, they applied medicine and bandaged the wound. Such enthusiasm of this female student should shame those men who do not love their country.</p>

<p>The son of my friend Mr. Zhang, who is only seven years old, usually loves to read comic books and listen to historical stories. This time, hearing his father often talk about the Japanese soldiers' brutal killings, he could not help but feel righteous indignation. He used oiled paper to draw many pictures of Xue Rengui's eastern expedition to eliminate the Japanese pirates. He took them to various walls to post them, and wrote in large characters: "Down with the Eastern Barbarians." His actions are also admirable.</p>

<p>— Zhurong Shi</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, the Japanese recklessly started a war regardless of international good faith, using military force to seize our Eastern Provinces, kill our compatriots, destroy our buildings, occupy our land, and seize our railways, carrying out their brutal killings. The League of Nations and the peace treaties are all lip service and do not deliver in practice, or even stand idly by. If the Chinese people do not save themselves, it will inevitably lead to the demise of the country. All my compatriots should unite together, pool our wisdom and efforts, and jointly resist the violent Japanese, so that we can avoid even the slightest chance of national destruction. However, our country's firearms and tactical training cannot compare to even one-tenth of Japan's. This is universally recognized. Therefore, economic severance with Japan and cessation of all cooperation with Japan are sufficient to control the Japanese. Trade between Japan and China ranks first among all countries in the world. The ambition for economic aggression has never begun today. The use of Japanese goods by the Chinese people can be seen everywhere. The goods imported into our country each year are counted in the tens of millions. Chinese people use Japanese goods because the prices are very cheap and the shapes and colors are light and wonderful. All of them pursue temporary benefits, so the medicine is used tirelessly. On the other hand, buying domestic goods is expensive and several times higher. Therefore, if you want economic severance and resist inferior goods, you must first have representative products. This is the fundamental solution. So that the Chinese people need a commodity, can promote their patriotic nature to buy domestic goods. Otherwise, just loudly shout slogans and do not study the root causes, it will inevitably lead to a half-hearted ending and cause people to make five-minute jokes. The other day I went to a domestic porcelain store to buy four teacups. I asked the price, and each one cost 1.6 yuan. The same Japanese goods cost 4 jiao. The difference between them is very large. A teacup is still such a difference, and why is anything else any different? So, in my humble opinion, we must seek the price of domestic goods to be cheaper than Japanese goods, so that the same goods will be more expensive for Japanese goods and cheaper for domestic goods, then buyers will be happy to use domestic goods. Japanese goods want to sell in our country, and can enter without a gap, even if there are treacherous merchants, such as Zhang Bingsheng, etc., there is no</p>

<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>Our Chinese crisis is becoming more serious day by day. Browsing through the newspapers is almost unbearable. The emotions of anger and indignation, and the boiling blood in my heart, prevent me from even indicating an outlet for them. When I picked up the pen, my hand was trembling. I wanted to express some opinions, but thinking back and forth, it was like a twenty-four history, and I didn't know where to start. At this critical moment of national survival and national life and death, some pleasure-seeking people, some soldiers who harm the country and love chaos, and some politicians who stir up trouble have now all awakened. Although the past is unbearable to recall, the future presents a symbol of peace and unity. Our Chinese future still has a ray of light. Compatriots, please do not be pessimistic, disappointed, and passive. We should encourage courage, tidy our steps, and work hard and courageously to move forward. Recently, the calls for unanimous economic severance with Japan, declarations of war against Japan, and sincere unity within the country have been echoing in the clouds. However, what is the use of empty words? Our compatriots should make a detailed study of these points and do some more practical work. It is not just the responsibility of the government alone, but all the people should jointly bear this arduous responsibility. We must first make a decision, forge strong physique, hone strong willpower, cultivate pure virtue, and maintain diligent perseverance. Concentrate on one thing and do everything we can with our manpower and financial resources. We will walk on the road of scientific construction and create a new foundation for our country and open up a new path of life. The government should promote and encourage it, and the society should assist and supervise it together. Young people should do it practically. A few people are more numerous. Originally simple atoms can be integrated into a whole crystal. Only in this way can we easily achieve final success.</p>
<p>Resisting Japan and saving the country is such a major issue that we don't just observe the surface and take it too easily. For example, in terms of economic severance with Japan, we must first make people understand how many types of Japanese goods are sold in China, the comparison of monthly and annual import tonnage, and the amount of economic losses. What Japanese goods sell the most? What sells the second most? Are there any domestic substitutes? How to study imitation, manufacture, and improvement methods? How to promote the productivity of domestic goods? Just analyzing it a little bit can prove that these problems all require scientific methods to investigate, statistics, and manufacture. Only then with goods can it have an effect. Otherwise, resisting Japanese goods is just a buzzword. I personally think that the most urgent requirements at present are: (1) Economic severance with Japan. Persevere to the end. (2) Resisting Japanese goods. It is better to exchange goods for goods. (3)</p>
<p>Permanent peaceful unification. Strive for scientific construction. (4) Please have the central government promulgate a five-year plan. (In fact, it would be enough to implement the resolutions passed but not implemented at the First, Second, and Third National Congresses of the Kuomintang and the previous National Assembly.)

<h3 id="e177">Thoughts on National Character from the Mid-Autumn Festival Night <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Qian</p>
<p>September 26th was the day when the city held a mass meeting of citizens to resist Japan and save the country at the Nanshi Public Sports Field. The details of the meeting and the resolutions passed have already been detailed in various newspapers. The grief and indignation of the people and the spirit of the nation can be seen from this. Moreover, the city government has issued a notice to suspend all entertainment in the city throughout the day. All of our countrymen should mourn without ceasing and should not have any joy. However, that day was the Mid-Autumn Festival (August 15th of the lunar calendar). Observing the city that night, most families, big and small, burned incense and lit candles, doing many meaningless things. Young men and women still enjoyed smoking, drinking, gambling, and dancing, all entering the land of happiness. What is even more lamentable is that during the lunar eclipse at midnight, the sound of gongs and firecrackers was endless for about three or four hours. With this useful property and concerted effort, they were wasted and depleted, which did not help the facts. And what happened to the day's grief and indignation and the heart of patriotism? Alas, the Japanese soldiers in the Northeast brutally killed our compatriots, and the blood has not yet stopped flowing. In the Central Plains, the floods have displaced famine victims, and the cries are still in our ears. However, most of our countrymen are indifferent, as if it has nothing to do with me. Their numbness and insensitivity can be described as extreme. Alas, the national character of our countrymen!</p>
<p>Natural disasters and foreign insults are coming together. May party and government leaders eliminate private grievances, end internal strife, and arouse the people. May they generously donate money and love the people with integrity to show great impartiality. May they tidy their steps and unite to save the people and save the country. This is my unlimited request. (No remuneration accepted.)</p>

<p>"The horse is coming! Make way!" The young man riding on the horse whipped it hard towards the east while shouting.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tao Chi, where are you riding to?" A friend on the side of the road asked when he saw him like this. "Looking for free air." Tao Chi twisted his body on horseback and answered. "Isn't the air here free?"</p>
<p>"Depressing..." Tao Chi went far away from the following answer, and the friend who asked the question on the side of the road could only hear it faintly, and could not hear what the words were.</p>
<p>"The horse is coming! Make way!" Tao Chi turned his horse back and hung sweat on his forehead, whipping hard towards the west. "Mr. Tao Chi, why are you turning back?" The friend who asked the question just now asked again. "It doesn't work on that side, so I have to turn back." Tao Chi twisted his body on horseback and answered again. "Isn't that a very wide first road?"</p>
<p>"Thorns..." Tao Chi went far away from the following answer; the friend who asked the question only heard a faint sound, and could not tell what the words were.</p>
<p>Running east, it will never work; running west, thorns will prick the horse's hooves; running south, the big water will block the army; running north, the ruggedness will hinder the horse's feet. Poor Tao Chi! Students are panting, groaning, sighing, and doubting. "In this vast and boundless world, is it impossible to hide my seven-foot body? In this vast and boundless space, is it impossible to inhale some unhindered free air?"</p>
<p>"Layman on the horse, don't be disappointed; if you want to find free air, please come to my humble temple for a short rest." Since he is called Layman and said that it is a humble temple, it is known without asking that it is the words of a transcendent talent. Tao Chi reined in his horse and looked, but it was an elder with white beard and eyebrows. Tao Chi was a little tired on horseback. When he met the elder and asked him to take a short rest, he just wanted to rest for a while before going to find free air.</p>
<p>He jumped off the horse very quickly and tied the horse to a locust tree. He looked up at the plaque on the lintel, but it said "Wuguan Temple". After passing the meeting ceremony with the elder, Jue Li knew that this elder was no ordinary person, but a highly knowledgeable monk; his eyebrows were full of kindness. The elder led him into the temple, and then entered the mountain gate of Wuguan Temple. He had always been against flattery of the Buddha. When he saw the Buddha statue, he just appreciated it from an artistic point of view. Instead, he treated the kind and amiable elder with full sincerity and interacted with him.</p>
