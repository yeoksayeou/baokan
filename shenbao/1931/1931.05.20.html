<p>歐聨委員會討論經濟問題。德法爲税約大開辯論之後。而第一次出席之蘇俄代表李維諾夫。復暢發其議論力評戰後之條約。謂現在歐洲經濟之危局。皆該條約所造成。并攻擊法國之新計劃。謂益足使歐洲托辣斯化貨價增高。大有助德以反對法國之意。而其結語。則主張共訂一經濟互守不犯之約。則是猶欲以此約解紛也。英外長漢德森主張將德奧税約。交付海牙國際法庭審查。亦是調解一時之策也。現德奥與法。已贊成英外長之建議。則在此審查未竣之前。税約可暫無問題。惟俄代表建議訂一經濟互守不犯之約。則其目光不僅在德法間税約之爭。而實在俄與資本主義國之爭。尤以法國首當其衝。觀其演說中列舉債務賠欵等種種事實。與對於傾銷貨物之爭辯。皆將成爲將來議會中之大問題。而絶對不易解决者。故吾謂德奥與法税約之爭。其影響猶小。而俄與資本主義國相爭之問題。影響實大。蓋其所謂修改條約與傾銷貨物等事。關係不僅法國一國。是亦可以見今後歐洲經濟戰局之趨勢矣。</p>

<p>國民社十八日日内瓦電　歐聨委員會議現仍繼續經濟問題之討論、蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫今日對於蘇俄在歐聨委員會中之立塲、有極長之演說、彼謂現在歐洲之危機、皆戰後條約所造成、其他各債務賠欵軍備種種、皆屬重要原因、彼對於法國之新計劃攻擊頗力、謂該計劃將益使歐托辣斯化、各項貨價將益增高、故彼建議共同訂定一經濟互守不犯之條約云</p>

<p>— 青松居士</p>
<p>少林以拳勇名天下。有所謂内家者。蓋起於宋之張三丰。三丰爲武當丹土。其人機警。靜以制動。平時不露圭角。非甚困則不發。發則百發百中。靡不應手而倒。百年而後。輾轉流傳。世少研究。此技成廣陵散久矣。方今國術盛行。民廳長胡樸安君。又竭力提倡。拳技之風。其復興於今日乎。因將父老所述。略得内家派者數人。雖不能認爲有技術之價值。而亦可作將伯之一助也。</p>
<p>舊川沙有盧紹弢者。得三丰之秘術。精微所在。靡不洞中。一日嘗夜出探事。爲邏者所獲。反縛廊柱。十數人圍而守之。紹弢拾碎磁而偷割其縛。探懷出銀。望空遥擲。衆方爭攫之。紹弢乘間逸。十數人追之。踣地不能起。旋又遇數兵士於途。欲拔刀擬之。紹弢眼明手快。力格其肩。兵反自擲仆地。鏗然刀墮。而紹弢已健步如飛。追踪莫及矣。</p>
<p>山東馮冠雄。豪勇出衆。捷足飛骽。號稱無敵。一日有僧人過訪。請與角力。貌旣猙獰可怖。且目動言肆。曰若能揮我一。拳。蹴我一足。我即推牛刀若縮胸者。非夫也。馮注視良久。凝神息氣運用筋骸。乘僧舉拳欲毆之勢。飛起一足。蹴騰僧肩僧已觸於石壁。壁倒而肱亦折。僧乃負創而去。不敢盛氣凌人。蓋馮素習易筋經。故能乘勢飛骽。僧壁同傾云。</p>
<p>雲間張之翼家饒於財。幼時温文爾雅。無偉丈夫氣。鄉里惡少。常狎侮之。張憤極。思所以報。乃往投少林寺僧。願執弟子禮。僧曰。文弱書生。奚學武爲。固請不已。僧乃授鐵椎。使兩足合力遥擲。始以五十斤。繼以百斤。期年技益進。更授三百斤之重要。玩弄如鐵丸。遠近疾徐。無不如意。僧喜曰。技盡此矣。張遂辭去。惡少見其歸。又欲肆故態以揶揄之。張乃於衆叢中。以兩足夾一人。擲之百步外。衆大譁。欲共擊張。甫近則已爲所擲。於是惡少動色相戒。無有敢攖其鋒者。</p>

<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>玫瑰花爲灌木之一種。絶類薔薇。高二三尺。有剌。葉作橢圓形。萼綠。花托爲臺狀。花紫。亦有作白色者。但不多見。香氣濃烈。夏初作花。各處皆産之。維吳興所出尤多。每當花開時。鄉人輒採入城求售。盈筐满簏。觸目皆是。於是城中藥肆及臨時花商。市其花烘之。烘法。以漏眼篩密佈花於上。下以火盆熾炭烘之。其火候須適當。不及則軟。太過則易碎。須老於此道者辨之。凡旬日而罷。謂之花市。花旣烘成。其售也輒以萬計。值銀可數十元。爲用則製香水蒸露浸酒和糖等。據長老言。吳興於清乾隆間。有富室宋海帆者。好揮霍。嘗集玫瑰花。於園中紮一牌樓。高三丈。芳香中人欲醉。人爭往觀。又有陳聞庭者。富相敵而心好勝。欲出其上。擬紮牌樓兩座以掩之。然花市僅數日。竭力搜羅。祗得其半。陳大怒。悉棄其花於駱駝橋下。一時江水爲紫云。</p>

<p>— 吳雲夢</p>
<p>麻瘋非不治之症。治療適時。未有不克奏膚功者。世人不察。視爲沈痼之疾。因循致誤。終至不治。毒貽子裔。爲害靡已。不亦大可悲乎。中華麻瘋救濟會救濟麻瘋。夙具熱忱。苦心孤詣。不遺餘力。旣設虹口施診所於先。復創麻瘋醫院於後。嘉惠窮黎。造福病者。蔑以加矣。乃者。世界麻瘋專家魏德博士。來自菲島。南洋荷屬華僑商業考察團。自海外來。麻瘋會設宴歡迎。濟濟一堂。盛事也。到者有工部局衞生處處長喬鄧。仁濟醫院院長巴德森。顔福慶刁信德朱少屏李元信等數十人。座中耳食所得。頗多可記者。</p>
<p>華僑商察。全團十有八人。都當地有名人物。余與該團副團長莊西言晤。握手道故。鬯譚甚久。其人亢爽諒直。談論風生。頗以國外貿易。日趨衰落爲慮。又以匯率一日數變。欲求什一之利。敻乎難矣。長此以往。結果豈堪設想。故此次回國觀光。擬與國内商界携手言歡。共圖發展。又云爪哇土著。踵事增華。印花布暢銷市上。唾棄土布如糞土。祇求其鮮艶奪目。品質優劣。初勿計也。新衣被體。不十日。色晦衣綻。棄面易新。土著頭腦之簡單如此。亡無日矣。言時感慨之深。溢於言表。席次。又與該團吳温儉同座。渠擁有米廠絶鉅。有數富商也。據其自稱。予目不識丁。胸無點墨。全恃一雙空手。奮鬥而來。居爪哇可二十餘載。初未聞國人結隊前往考察商務者。美日德法諸國。無歲無之。其居心何在。不問可知。欲奪我華夏後裔數百年來苦心經營之基業而制我死命耳。憂國傷時。亦有心人也。</p>
<p>席旣闌。會長李元信致歡迎詞。魏德博士起立演說。大旨謂麻瘋事業得有今日之成績。全恃社會人士之熱心贊助。麻瘋症。非不可治。患在不即治耳云云。末由該會幹事鄔志堅報告該會五年運動。如召集全國麻瘋會議。調查中國麻瘋人數。釐訂麻瘋法律等。俱爲當務之急。其言最足驚人者。則謂全世界麻瘋患者。可二百萬人。而我華患者。幾佔總數之半。此一百萬病人。無日不在散布其病毒。傳子若孫。若不急起撲滅。爲害誠有不堪設想者。演詞警策。聞者動容。酒闌人散。已十時許矣。</p>

<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>余家後園古壁下。有小草生焉。厥名骨牌草。每值初夏。青蔥摇曵。雖高不及几。而輝映苔砌間。較之盆玩絶勝。其形作羊齒類。而葉之背有細點。彌佈其上。驟觀之。一如牌狀。而以植物學家言之。則爲隱花植物。其點爲細胞。即其種子所孕耳。</p>
<p>然余考錢塘趙恕軒所著本草綱目拾遺。有魚鼈金星草。唯魚則葉長而尖。鼈則葉短而團。此其異焉。魚葉老則背有金星。鼈葉雖枯。無此殊異。且金星草細者。葉如鴨脚。背亦有點。恰如三十二扇牌色。顧缺五六一隻。昔德清俞蔭甫氏。目爲七星草。殆即指骨牌草。見著於春在堂。其是否未敢斷言。</p>
<p>余幼時攻書之暇。輙以此草編排成對。至罔或有缺乃已。間作打五關之需。否則。夾於所讀之書中。閲時旣久。葉片之綠素。日漸消失。成紫褐色。乃宛如牌形。而其平滑又似象質。且悦目。又可玩。故極喜愛。今此草猶存。特不易移植。蓋其性畏陽光。而宜於陰處叢蘚爲緣。乃得滋長萌發。蔓生於庭階之間。而其點數之多少。亦能正確無稍差也。</p>

<p>瀋陽縣長李君怡忱省政府秘書長金君靜盦導游北陵之北一個農村。名大含英屯。非常有趣。先觀小學校。男生一百十六人。女生二十六人。年費二千三百十八圓。校舍由學董鄭榮禧君題募特建。全村二百四十戶。一千二百三十二人。學齡兒童差不多全部就學。年長失學者男八十二人。女五十人。無失業者。村長辦公室統計圖表多可觀。村民最富者四家。有田三百餘畝。騾五六匹。大多數是佃農。農産以高粱。大豆。粟爲主。麥甚少。水稻無有。村人自定公約。凡故意竊奪或損害禾畜者。分别處罰。</p>
<p>入一劉姓農家。兄弟五人皆已娶妻生子。但仍同居。長兄業廚子。四弟都棄農。屋僅南向一排。東室爲兄嫂臥房。西室一大間。其中四炕南北相對。四雙夫婦帶他的兒女。各占一炕。把「妻子好合。兄弟旣翕」兩句詩意。公開的表演出來。室的西盡頭。端拱着祖宗木主。朔望。全家行禮。可見他們風俗的樸且厚。包含着不少古意。門外小的場地。牲畜車輛農産物縱横满地。全家正忙着幹他們的活計。</p>
<p>此村舊名韓英屯。有一故事。清初顔習齋（元）的父親名昶。幼被略至遼東。死。葬此村。見習齋年譜。習齋尋親不得。招魂題主而歸。今此墓找不到了。</p>

<p>霍桑沉着目光。呼了兩口烟。慢慢的點着頭應道。「我也覺得伊如此。不過「戀愛之神」和「秘密之仙」。往往會發生葭莩之親。並且因戀愛而出於秘密。也不能隨便加上「機詐」的字樣。旣然如此。我們假定有什麽人向伊單戀。在佩芬還没有覺察哩。」我應道。「這假定確很近情。不過旣說畢戀。範圍就也不小那人是不是伊的男同學。或是親戚中的一個。或是佩賢的朋友。我們又何從着手。」霍桑道。「着手固然難些。不過也並不是完全没有線路。譬如那條項圈。也未始不可做一種線索。我因着這一句話。又引起了先前的疑團。我問道。「這項圈問題我至今還解釋不出。我們旣假定他因單戀而誤會。把我當做他的情敵。因而設計暗算。那條項圈便是暗算計劃中的一種重要東西。但咄嗟之間。他怎麽來得及製備。若說他事先藏在袋中。專門和我作難。又覺不近情理。你想這東西的來由。究竟怎麽樣呢。霍桑低倒了頭。又把烟尾丢進了痰盂。接着他抬起頭來。他的唇角上嘻了一嘻。緩緩答道。「這確是一個難題。據我看來。這東西决不是爲着你而特地置備的。不過在解釋這個疑點之前。必須先查明這個人的眞相。這個人的地位怎樣。性情怎樣。都有關係。譬如他假使是一個荒蕩的浪漫少年。那麽。他身上的　僞飾品。也許不止道一條項圈。他如果遇到機會。便利用這些贋鼎。做他欺騙女子們的香餌。這是一種理解。」我點頭道。「這樣的少年委實到處都有。這種人眞是婦女們的仇敵。實在可殺霍桑冷冷的笑了一笑說道。「你何必作這種無聊的感慨呢。你這幾句牢騷。對於社會。可會發生什麽影響。」我歎了一口氣。又問道。「你不是還有第二種理想麽。」霍桑忽而立起身來。沉着臉色。發一種比較嚴冷的聲音答道。「假使這個少年的行徑。比浪漫還進一步。他的目的不但在肉慾的满足。還着眼到金錢的問題。那麽。這項圈的作用更可怕了。」我又問道。「你可是說他準備着這條項圈。以便隨時行使他的詐騙手段。以假換眞麽。」霍桑不答。忽向他的手表上瞧了一瞧。忙道。「唉。一點過了。我們再不必空談。蘇媽。趕快弄飯。吃過飯我還有事呢。」</p>

<p>本市砂石同業一千餘家、因反對浙省建設廳增加管理費與地産費問題、於前晩一致休業、茲將各情探誌如下、</p>
<p>休業原因　砂石業休業原因、一方面固係反對增加捐税、而另一方面係反對大昌包辦徵税、壟斷砂石業、蓋自大昌承包砂石徵税後、同時即設一益泰號、以銷售砂石、並自造大號船隻、以資裝運、於是砂石同業、因增税後、每噸售價二元之砂石、須納一元餘之捐税、同時該業對於售出方面、則又因訂有合同、不能增價、而益泰旣爲承包砂石税之大昌所組織、遂佔優勝地位、砂石同業、鑒於無利可圖、即於前晩一致自動休業、以爲抵抗</p>
<p>公會勸告　砂石同業公會方面、昨晨據會員龔武壽報告、即分赴各處、勸告復工、終以此次係出於各業自動、而人數過多、未有效果、於是公會方面、遂以遵守秩序靜候解决相勉、故昨日秩序尚佳、</p>
<p>影響建築　自前晩砂石休業後、槓運駁裝、完全停止、以是建築工程塲所、即發生無貨可做之感、聞營造業方面、開會討論辦法、同時與砂石有關之槓工駁運運車等五萬餘工人、亦受其休業而發生恐慌、</p>

<p>肉商仍在繼續休業中</p>
<p>本市鮮肉同業、爲屠宰税問題休業案、業已五日、茲將昨日所得各項情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>市財局佈告　市財局因全市肉商尚未開業、昨特發出佈告云、爲佈告事、查市區屠税、係奉中央核准、推作敎育經費專欵、歷由江蘇敎育經費管理處招商認辦、現爲統一治權、移交本市徵收、已於五月一日起、由本局各　徵處發售税票、實行開徵、並佈告週知在案、計宰猪一頭、收税一角九分、宰羊一頭、收税二角、與從前包商承辦時税率相同、且可零星購票、便利納税、乃訪有不肖之徒、散佈蜚語、謂屠税收回官辦、即將增加税額、迫令肉商全體罷業、以爲要挾之地、冀達若輩漁利中飽之目的、造謡惑衆、殊堪痛恨、除已呈報市政府曁查明造謡之人、依法嚴辦外、合再出示佈告、爾肉業商人、不乏明達、須知本局直接徵税、係爲革除包商壟斷之弊、化私爲公、用符税制起見、旣不變更税率、何由加重負擔、務宜即日開業、遵章購領税票、毋得受人愚弄、遲疑觀望、自招損失、是爲至要、特佈、</p>
<p>衞生局勸告　各肉店均悉、本局因爲你們受了少數想包辦屠宰税的人之煽惑、盲從附和的、替那些别有暗算的人、摇旗呐喊、甚至停市、做那些陰謀家的犧牲品、本局因爲辦理檢騐牲畜等事、對於鮮肉業多所接近、深曉得你們的確也不是利市三倍的營業、更曉得你們往往被人利用、往往被人操縱、祇要有人鼓動、拿領導你們抗税這句話來做個表面上的好題目、你們就不問理由正當不正當、也不問鼓動的人有没有暗算的陰謀、一聽了甜蜜的話、就把正理丢開了、一聽了激剛的話、就把自已見解抹煞了、這種現象、實在可痛可憐之至、所以本局曾在報上發表過一篇勸告、（見五月十五日申報新聞報民國日報本埠新聞欄）恐怕没有看見、或雖看見、而不能明白了解的鮮肉店、仍居多數、所以現在再來勸告一翻、望大家要從法理事實各方面研究研究、把這件事平心靜氣的想想看、總要爲維持自己的程度地位起見、要爲正當的理解、才不會做他人的傀儡、要有勇於從善的氣度、才是開明的市民、現在分做幾段來請你們想想看、（一）包辦認税制度、是免不了中飽漁利的弊害、是公家收入與商家負擔當中的　蟲、至於按照物品數量、由合法徵收機關直接收税、是公平無欺的辦法、現在市政府先把包認屠宰税的惡制取消、實行公平無欺的辦法、你們在良心上應該極端贊成、而你們不顧正義、附和想要包辦的人、來反對合於正理的改革、究竟是何理由呢、（二）或者也許肉店當中、從前有與包商串通、把應繳的屠宰税、私自妥協、私自減少、把公家應有的收人、拿來被此朋分、現在打破了包繳制度、彼此不能再討朋分應出税欵的便宜、所以附和反對、但是這種侵害公家收入的行爲、是應該的麽、這稚朋分式的舉動、是正當的麽、你們附和反對屠宰税、究竟有何理由呢、（三）屠宰税一項、原由江蘇省政府招商包繳、現在本市市政府根據中央議决行使治權的法案、收還徵收職權、收税的税率、又未增加、肉店不過把應出的屠宰税、改繳到市政府、市政府又須劃撥若干、抵補江蘇省的敎育經費、旣非新創税欵、又未增加你們的負擔、盲從附和的反對、無意義的罷市、究有什麽顚撲不破的理由呢、（四）有人鼓動造謡、說現在財政局徵收屠宰税、要買整本税票、肉商方面、感覺不便、但是據本局詢問所得、税票無論整本或零張、均可任憑肉商領取、且可在市内各處爲抵繳屠宰税之用、那種鼓惑的謡言、大家竟然輕信無疑麽、竟然值得因此罷市麽、附和反抗、究有什麽正大光明的理由呢、根據以上的討論、屠宰税是不是應該照繳、大家從正理上想想、實在無反對的理由、别有作用的人、還想把本市檢騐牲畜同建設宰牲廠等正當事實、拿來牽扯一起、以便煽惑大家、利用大家做他們向官署要求的榥子、未免太覺險狠、太覺目無鮮肉店、以爲都是見解幼稚、儘可大放手段、任其利用、這種被人欺騙愚弄、想必大家是不甘心的、但是因爲欺愚的内幕、不曾戳穿、大家上了當、還不曾曉得、所以大家應快快覺悟、勿再受人愚弄、從速復業、免受損失、如有强暴或恐嚇脅迫的人、儘可密報官署、請求分别保護拘辦、或就近報告崗警、崗警當然應該制止的、本局一再勸告、完全是根據法理的推求、深念鮮肉店受惑受迫的隱痛、用善意的勸告、務各接受善言、快快復業爲要、</p>

<h3 id="c178">坎拿大汽車事業概觀 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 頌虞</p>
<p>温特沙訊。坎拿大汽車事業因汽車進口税則修改。頗有復興之象。五年之前。坎拿大汽車事業祗能維持其小康之狀態。蓋以美國人之經營汽車製造業者。如在坎拿大之一工廠。較之在美洲設廠。經濟開支均較低廉。今則因税則保護之關係。勢必令向日運輸汽車進口者。在本地製造。以求保留坎拿大之汽車市塲也。</p>
<p>坎拿大汽車事業之所以有如此轉機者。實由於首相班納脱氏之閣令。將汽車税則修正。因而目下來自美國之汽車。祇照當地零售之價。再加以百分之二十之經售人折扣。如其數逾百分之二十者即不能進口矣。此蓋言凡汽車價值在一千二百元或以上者。須徵税百分之二十七年。價值在一千二百元以下者徵税百分之二十。而均須賦以百分之八十之美國售價。昔日經售商所得之折扣。約自百分之二十七至百分之四十。據進口商人稱。則謂百分之二十之折扣。僅足以餬口而已。渠所經售之汽車。較之在坎拿大境内所造之同樣價值汽車。常比較的爲貴也。</p>
<p>新税則頒佈之後。汽車進口商對於首相。抨擊不遺餘力。然美國之汽車製造家則已費去甚多之時間。與當局相商。在坎拿大設置汽車製造分工廠。在最短時間中大約即有六七廠家將加入於坎拿大實業界中也。凡此諸廠家。其所造之汽車售價將在一千元左右云。</p>
<p>以目下而論。利哇·黑潑麻皮爾及納許等三家。已籌備就緒在坎拿大設廠。利哇及納許兩廠設於托隆多。黑潑麻皮爾則將在温特沙開設工廠也。在閣議未頒之前。坎拿大之汽車事業爲十一家公司及十四家工廠所組織。此項從事汽車事業之公司工廠。專門建造及裝配運貨車公共汽車及客車等。通用汽車公司在哇下華温特沙。及里奇那等處設有工廠。福特廠則到處皆有分廠。其總部設於温特沙。萬國。高德弗來森。通用摩托。　來哈姆。及國家運貨車等牌。咸在坎拿大東部製造。杜蘭脱及惠萊司哇浮蘭則在托隆多所造。汽車事業大有跌落之象。各種車輛之銷數由百分之三十跌至二十七及二十不等。零件之輸入坎拿大者。徵税仍高。故而坎拿大之工廠大有關閉之象。蓋新車之製造。尚不及進口車輛之爲廉也。其後政府受各方催促乃有變改税率之舉。凡汽車一輛。其製造之費用。百分之五十或以上之材料。爲坎拿大所自製者。則可折減百分之二十五之進口零件關税。但此種辦法尚不能使新廠生存。蓋事實上仍以進口較當地製造爲廉也。</p>
<p>目下情勢一變。進口之汽車價值較之坎拿大自造者。其貴不可相提並論。不過售價極昻之汽車不在此便。因其市塲銷數有限。仍以外來者爲便宜。坎拿大五百家之零件製造家。將供給新公司造車之需要。乃爲意中之事。此端一開。則當地所需工人自亦加多。坎拿大每八人可得汽車一輛外。今後之汽車製造家又能將新車輸出國外至不列顚領土等處。凡與坎拿大有特别條約者。均能得其益利。較之直接由美國輸出者爲鉅也。</p>
<p>坎拿大本身之汽車出口業。約佔出産三分之一或百分之五十之數。坎拿大居世界汽車出産之第三位置。亦即需用汽車者之第三位。</p>

<p>— 談紫電</p>
<p>奧國汽車名家雪特葛利芙斯（A.　F.　Sdgreaves）曰。全世界之汽車出品。雖如恒河沙數。不可勝計。然當推英國奥斯汀首屈一指。蓋汽車之優劣。全賴内部機器之是否完善。奥斯汀機器堅固。堪稱無匹。且汽油節省售價低廉。頗合宜於中等資産階級購駛余駕駛奥斯汀已四載。雖狂風暴雨中。崎嶇之山途上。亦必駕駛。四年來未嘗修理。若非奥斯汀之機器完善車身堅固葛克臻此。</p>
<p>福特A式車較之福特T式老車。優良已多。耗用汽油方面。平均可節省三分之二。其速率方面。亦大有進步也。</p>
<p>美國汽車月報社。嘗登報徵求讀者投票。述各人心目中以何種汽車爲最優。結果竟有二萬四千餘票之多。克雷斯勒車獨得二千八百三十四票獲首選。理由爲堅固耐用式樣美觀。茲將各車所得票數列下。藉以窺見各車優劣之一斑。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Zhang Xueliang Still in Nanjing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Airplane Unable to Take Off Due to Rain</p>
<p>Chiang Invited Zhang, He, and Others to Discuss Matters Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang's Ford airplane cannot take off because of the continuous rain and muddy airport. It needs to be sunny for two days before it can take off. Zhang still has a few days to stay. All deputy-ministerial level personnel, the second train originally scheduled to depart tonight, will also be delayed slightly. According to the driver, Mr. Purley, the Ford aircraft is relatively heavy. If it is sunny for two days, the airport will be dry and the departure will be stable. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two battalions of guards accompanying Zhang Xueliang to Nanjing arrived in Beiping this morning. After a portion disembarked, they went to Xin Jian Hutong to arrange security. A portion remained on the train. Zhang himself is scheduled to fly back north from Nanjing today. Military police are on alert at Nanyuan Airport. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today at 3 PM, Yu Xuezhong, Zhou Dawen, Zhang Xueming, Bao Yulin, Qi Dapeng, and others waited for Zhang Xueliang at Nanyuan Airport. By 6 PM, they received a telegram from Nanjing stating that it was raining in Nanjing this morning. Zhang's Ford airplane may fly north around 20th. Yu, Bao, and other important figures then returned to the city. Zhang Xueming said that he came to report on the situation of the Tianjin Municipal Government to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. He will return to Tianjin in two or three days. He is currently planning to renovate the roads in Tianjin, imitating the former German Concession in Tianjin. It will take three months and cost 100,000 yuan to complete. Wang Shuchang will come to Beiping tonight to welcome Zhang. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fearing that Zhang Xueliang would stay in Tianjin if he flew north, the provincial and municipal authorities notified the British Racecourse on the morning of the 19th that a Ford airplane might land there during the day and requested assistance in taking care of it. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Public Security Bureau dispatched plainclothes special agents to the racecourse to provide protection, waiting until sunset, but the airplane did not arrive. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Guangmu returned to Nanjing from Hangzhou yesterday and saw Zhang in the evening. Zhang arranged to return to Beiping on the same airplane within a few days. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang visited the Surveying and Mapping Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters on the afternoon of the 19th, and was received by Director Huang Musong. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang believes that the National Assembly has concluded and his mission in Nanjing is complete, and he is eager to return to Beiping. Deputy-ministerial level personnel and the guard battalion stationed in Pukou have already returned north in batches by train the day before yesterday. The remaining accompanying personnel have also been ordered to prepare for departure. On the 19th, Chiang invited He Yingqin, He Chengjun, Han Fuju, He Jian, Lu Disheng, and others to discuss the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi and Hunan, as well as other issues. Zhang also participated in the meeting. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Guangmu said that Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang has completed his affairs in Nanjing and will naturally return north within a few days. However, the date of departure has not yet been determined. A special train and a Ford airplane are both being prepared. Whether to travel by train or by airplane will also be decided at the last minute. As for when the Deputy Commander-in-Chief will return to Liaoning after arriving in Beiping, it will be decided after arriving in Beiping. The newly appointed President of the Military Advisory Council, Zhang Jinghui, plans to travel north with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang, as the affairs of the Harbin Chief Executive's Office still need to be taken care of. He will determine the date of his return to Nanjing after arriving in Harbin. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Third Meeting Will Be Held the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The second meeting of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees resolved to allocate (1) £265,000 for Chinese students studying in the UK and the Chinese Committee of various universities in London, (2) £200,000 for the University of Hong Kong Fund, (3) £2,000 for subsidies to the Beiping Court, and (4) £40,000 for the construction of the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs office, totaling £497,000.

The third meeting of the Board of Trustees is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 22nd.

<p>No Concrete Progress Yet</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lampson arrived in Nanjing on the 18th and has discussed legal rights with Foreign Minister Wang in detail. There has been no concrete response to the last two points of contention. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Foreign Minister Wang, the declaration of suspension of negotiations on the 4th has not yet been formally notified to various countries. The issue of recovering concessions is currently being actively pursued. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Minister Lampson told people that he had met with the Foreign Minister yesterday, and the conversation was mostly general. They briefly discussed legal rights. The British side believes that there are four points in the regulations on the administration of foreign litigation promulgated by China that are not easy to implement and requests China to consider them so that British residents can rest assured. Now that the Sino-British legal rights negotiations have been suspended, they have become negotiations on the foreign litigation law. The British side hopes to have a reasonably cordial and feasible method before its implementation next year. (19th Dispatch)</p>

If his departure from the country was not enough and he was venting his anger because of it, then he dared not hear of it. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the loans that our country borrowed from Britain and France were repaid annually from customs duties. According to the original contract, the loans were to be paid off in 35 years. This year, they have been paid off. There is an annual surplus of more than 10 million yuan in customs duties, which can be used as a fund for future new treasury bonds. (19th Dispatch)</p>

The note stated that the countries of the Far East have shifted from the silver standard to the gold standard. China is the only country currently on the silver standard. The current disastrous drop in silver prices, although the world is affected, China is the most harmed. The solution is to conduct a fundamental investigation. At the same time, our country's representatives expressed this intention to the representatives of Britain, Japan, and other countries attending the Chamber of Commerce, and it is said that they have all expressed their approval. Therefore, the convening of the silver price conference in China is gradually becoming concrete. The convening period is approximately between September and October. Shanghai is the most advocated location. Currently, our country's financial authorities are preparing to use the power of the government to collect various materials and plan to gather many experts to study everything in preparation for future contributions.

<h3 id="e8">Hunan People in Beijing Prepare for Communist Suppression Commemoration <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) May 21 is the anniversary of the suppression of the communists in Hunan. The Hunan Association in Nanjing has decided to hold a commemorative meeting on that morning. First, on the evening of the 19th, the association invited committee members and the press to a dinner party. Executive Committee member Jiang Yuhuan reported the facts, saying that since May 21, 1927, Xu Kexiang, commander of the 33rd regiment of the provincial defense army, discovered that the Red bandits were plotting an uprising. At that time, the Red bandit organizations, such as the pseudo-Provincial Party Department, the General Labor Union, the Farmers' Association, and the Special Court, had tens of thousands of people, and there were more than ten thousand guns, knives, and spears. Xu used one regiment of troops, bravely and swiftly, and in less than ten hours, completely eliminated them all. The people of Hunan were spared a great calamity. If the military and political leaders had continued their efforts later, it would not have been difficult to suppress them completely. However, after four years, the Hunan bandits are still rampant, and the provincial capital and various counties have suffered red disasters, which is unbearable to describe and extremely painful. Our commemoration should be viewed as the suppression of the Red bandits is not only a local issue for Hunan Province, but a matter of the overall interests of the Republic of China and the entire world. It is hoped that the military and civilians will work together to strive and fight, and especially hope that the media will do their best to publicize, so that the people can get out of the fire and water as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e27">Speech by the Russian Representative at the League of Nations <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Committee of the League of Nations is discussing economic issues. After Germany and France engaged in a major debate over tax agreements, the Soviet Russian representative Litvinov, attending for the first time, eloquently expressed his views, strongly criticizing the post-war treaties. He stated that the current economic crisis in Europe was caused by these treaties and attacked France's new plan, saying that it would further trustify Europe and increase commodity prices, greatly assisting Germany in opposing France. His conclusion was to advocate jointly signing an economic non-aggression pact, which is tantamount to resolving disputes with this pact. British Foreign Secretary Henderson proposed that the German-Austrian tax agreement be submitted to the Hague International Court of Justice for review, which is also a temporary reconciliation measure. Currently, Germany, Austria, and France have agreed to the British Foreign Secretary's suggestion. Therefore, before the review is completed, the tax agreement can be temporarily resolved. However, the Russian representative's suggestion to sign an economic non-aggression pact not only focuses on the tax agreement dispute between Germany and France, but is actually a dispute between Russia and capitalist countries, with France taking the brunt. Looking at the various facts listed in his speech, such as debts and reparations, and the debate over dumping goods, these will become major problems in future parliamentary sessions and will be absolutely difficult to resolve. Therefore, I believe that the impact of the tax agreement dispute between Germany, Austria, and France is still small, while the problem of the dispute between Russia and capitalist countries has a greater impact. Because what he calls treaty revision and dumping of goods is related not only to France. This also shows the future trend of the economic war situation in Europe.</p>

<p>Claims Post-War Treaties Caused Current Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Declares Refusal to Adopt Russian Goods Dumping Policy</p>
<p>Advocates for Countries to Conclude Economic Non-Aggression Pacts</p>
<p>Spares No Effort in Criticizing Briand's New Plan</p>
<p>League of Nations Administrative Council Accepts British Motion</p>
<p>German-Austrian Customs Union to Be Submitted to Hague Court for Review</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th: At today's European Union Committee meeting, Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov delivered a speech, putting forward an important proposal for the Soviet Union and the rest of the world to conclude a pact to cease economic aggression, with the aim of dispelling the existing atmosphere of distrust, so that the Soviet system of government and the capitalist system of government can coexist in peace. In his speech, Litvinov vehemently refuted the claim that Soviet Russia was dumping raw and manufactured goods on the world, instead claiming that capitalist countries were engaging in dumping, pointing out that today's European economic crisis was entirely caused by capitalist governments, and that only the Soviet state system was the true method of salvation. Although the Soviet government is now willing to cease economic warfare with other types of governments and jointly address the problems caused by the long-term economic decline, it should be noted that the European Union Committee opened on the 15th with the task of resolving issues such as unemployment, tariff barriers, production costs, surplus disposal, and the establishment of an international central bank. As this is the first time the Soviet Union has attended and participated, Litvinov's speech today has attracted much attention here.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th: The European Union Committee meeting is continuing its discussion of economic issues. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov today gave a very long speech on the Soviet Union's position in the European Union Committee. He said that the current European crisis was caused by post-war treaties, and that other debts, reparations, and armaments were all important reasons. He strongly attacked France's new plan, saying that the plan would further increase the level of oligarchization and further increase the prices of various goods. Therefore, he suggested that a treaty of mutual economic non-aggression should be jointly concluded.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th: While this League of Nations Committee meeting has made slow progress, the League of Nations Council, chaired by German Foreign Minister Curtius, today passed a British motion to submit the legal issues of the German-Austrian Customs Union to the Hague International Court of Justice for review. After the British proposal was passed, British Foreign Secretary Henderson stood up again to ask Austrian Chancellor Schober whether Austria was willing to temporarily suspend the German-Austrian Customs Union pending resolution by the League of Nations Council. Schober replied that Austria agreed to temporarily suspend the treaty, but that the Hague Court should expedite the review. Henderson nodded in agreement. French Foreign Minister Briand also stood up to express his support. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi also gave a brief speech, acknowledging that the goals of Germany and Austria were purely economic. German Foreign Minister Curtius also expressed his acceptance of the British proposal and expressed optimism about the future of the review.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 19th: This morning, the League of Nations Council continued to discuss the German-Austrian Customs Union case. The Czech Foreign Minister and the Belgian Foreign Minister spoke successively, but because the British motion had been accepted yesterday, the audience did not pay much attention to them. It is expected that the issue of disarmament will be discussed today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th: At today's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council to continue discussing the German-Austrian Customs Union, French Foreign Minister Briand stated that after the agreement is submitted to the Hague Court, its political aspects should be decided by the League of Nations Administrative Council. Thereupon, German Foreign Minister Curtius replied in a brief and decisive manner, saying that if the Hague Court rules that the agreement is legal, but still wants to regard Germany as disrupting European peace and be subject to the Administrative Council's sanctions, it would be intolerable. The audience was moved by this. Subsequently, British Foreign Secretary Henderson's proposal of yesterday was put forward and unanimously approved by the audience.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th: The government of the Free City of Danzig declared that it could not participate in the European Union Committee meeting, because the invitation from the committee was only forwarded to the Danzig government by the Polish government today (Monday). The reason given was that the time was too short to make preparations in advance, so it was unable to participate.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 18th: According to a recent newspaper report, Foreign Minister Briand will return to France from Geneva this Thursday. Briand will resign from the position of Foreign Minister from that day. After Briand's resignation, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alexis Léger, will likely succeed him as the leader of the French delegation to Geneva. According to sources in political circles, the new President Paul Doumer is scheduled to take office on June 13. Before Doumer takes office, current Prime Minister Laval will temporarily serve concurrently as Foreign Minister. After Doumer takes office, Laval may reorganize the cabinet and increase the power of the left wing.</p>

<p>Cannons Fire in Salute</p>
<p>Hindenburg Attends the Ceremony in Person</p>
<p>Reuters, Kiel, 19th: President Hindenburg arrived here this morning specifically to perform the launching ceremony of the new 10,000-ton battleship Deutschland. Ships in the harbor and coastal batteries fired salutes. The ship cost £4 million to build, overturning the calculations of world disarmament experts. It can travel 18,000 miles in one go, with a speed of up to 26 knots per hour. It is equipped with six 11-inch guns, eight 5.9-inch guns, four anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes. Its design is strictly kept secret. Germany plans to build three more of these battleships by 1936. Today, the entire city of Kiel and the German fleet in the harbor are decorated with flags and colored streamers. 56,000 spectators were present, including Prime Minister Brüning and cabinet members, as well as 10,000 schoolchildren. During the ceremony, Brüning delivered a speech, roughly saying that Germany has shown the world that although Germany is subject to various restrictions and its economic difficulties are very serious, it still has the strength to defend peace and maintain national glory. Germany is now faithfully fulfilling its disarmament obligations and hopes that other countries will follow suit.</p>

<p>Gandhi's Prestige Does Not Diminish</p>
<p>London Dispatch: The Indian National Congress is now using the "truce" opportunity to consolidate its revolutionary organization. During last year's anti-British movement, 75,000 male and female members of the Congress were arrested, causing temporary internal chaos. Now that the members have returned to their original positions, they are determined to show their strength to the British government once again. The number of members of the National Congress has been gradually increasing recently, and it is expected that its strength will be further consolidated by the time the next Round Table Conference is held. When Gandhi and Governor-General Irwin joined hands to conclude a reconciliation agreement, many people thought that Gandhi's prestige among the Indian people had been greatly lost, but the situation in recent weeks has proved this assumption to be inaccurate. In fact, since his release from prison and the signing of the treaty with the Indian Governor, the stimulation he has given to the people and the respect he has received from the people have been unprecedented.

<p>Serious Disturbances Continue in Various Places</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 19th: Yesterday was the last and most important day of the Egyptian primary elections. Disturbances occurred in three towns in the Dakahlia province, resulting in the death of seven rioters and the injury of several others. Four police officers were also injured. There were also reports of deaths and injuries elsewhere. The Egyptian Prime Minister claimed last night that 65% of the electorate in the election areas had voted. Unfortunately, there was bloodshed, but the police firing was unavoidable and the last resort to quell the riot.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 19th: Egyptian officials claim that the election indicates a great victory for the government party. Although the voting age has been raised from 21 to 25, and the opposition party has boycotted the voting, the proportion of actual voters to the total number of voters is still higher than in previous elections, which proves that the majority of the people support the government.</p>

<p>Chamberlain Questions the House of Commons</p>
<p>America Frequently Sends Overtures to Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain raised the Russian question in the House of Commons tonight, accusing the Labour government of heeding Russia's violations of its promises and disregarding warnings, and said that since Russia has repeatedly broken its promises, why does the government still give it special treatment under the export credit plan? Prime Minister MacDonald replied that in 1926, when Chamberlain was the Foreign Secretary, he had advised the House of Commons to abandon the narrow view on the destruction of the Anglo-Russian agreement, and the reasons Chamberlain held at that time still exist today. Therefore, the Labour government also believes that there is no need to cancel the commercial treaty. Although the results of trade with Russia are disappointing, breaking off relations with Russia will not gain anything. The problems encountered in India, China, or at home will not become simpler because of breaking off relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th: The New York Times' Washington dispatch stated that the recent expression of willingness by Soviet Russia to cooperate with other exporting countries has made a good impression on the US government. According to recent telegrams from Russia, Russia seems to be preparing to establish an international agreement to adjust the export prices in the world market and is preparing to find ways to improve the working environment of Russian laborers.</p>

<p>But the Judiciary Opposes Strongly</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th: The Cabinet has approved the principle of salary reduction, but the detailed measures are still under discussion. Those who oppose this move are gaining momentum, especially in the judiciary and the railway sector. The previous Hamaguchi Cabinet also proposed this proposal, but it was abandoned due to the opposition of judicial personnel and others.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The opposition to salary reduction by judicial officers and railway personnel has gradually spread to all aspects. Officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs have also gradually expressed opposition and dissatisfaction, especially subordinate officials with monthly salaries below 100 yuan, whose lives are affected. They are also not enthusiastic about official duties. In view of this situation, the heads of the Ministry of Home Affairs believe that reducing the salaries of lower-level officials may have an adverse impact on the election of prefectural and county council members this week. The reduction of salaries for lower-level officials and clerks will be considered carefully and may be excluded.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 19th: After a large-scale textile strike broke out in northeastern France, the local area is still considered peaceful, but in textile centers such as Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing, troops are stationed in factories, and police and militias patrol the streets. The strictness of the alert is like a large military camp. Currently, 400 factories have suspended operations, and 120,000 workers are on strike. Only a dozen factories are still able to operate normally. The number of troops transferred to the strike area to maintain order has reached 12,000.</p>
<p>Reuters, Osaka, 18th: The labor unrest at the Sumitomo Steel Plant became more serious last night. The company employs a total of 1,300 workers, of whom 800 launched a work slowdown to protest their dissatisfaction with wages. Yesterday, the workers held a meeting in a factory and criticized Sumitomo and the police.</p>

<p>Nanjing Telegram: To All Newspaper Offices: The telegram you read is sincere, its words are stern, its meaning is righteous, and it truly wins my heart. We, as members of the Party and soldiers of the branch bureau, only know to obey the Party's program and abide by military discipline. Moreover, at a time when the national assembly has been successfully convened and the foundation of the country is being laid, we should sincerely uphold peace and carry out construction to comfort the spirit of the Premier in Heaven and to live up to the eagerness of the people at home and abroad for governance. How can we allow the private opinions of a few people to cause disputes again and affect the overall situation? As for the five provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Anhui, the Red bandits are causing disturbances and their harm is intense. Our brave soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, under the orders of the Central Government, are sleeping with their weapons, waiting for the day to rescue the people from fire and water and to place them on mats. It is not a matter of morning or evening. If we do not take this opportunity to expedite the completion of the bandit suppression plan, but instead give them a chance to survive, it will be difficult to eliminate the weeds and the country will perish. The words in your telegram are truly chilling. Our army takes peaceful reunification as its duty, protects the people and loves the country, has sympathy, and shares the worry of carrying each other across the river. We vow to be in the same boat, only hoping that honest words will be heeded and lead to harmony. Not only will the people of Guangdong be grateful, but the future of the Party and the country will be deeply benefited, etc. We hope that all compatriots at home and abroad and comrades in the Party will uphold justice together, so as to eliminate the sprouts of disaster. We are most eager to see this happen. Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Jiliang, Chen Xunyong, and Zeng Yiding kowtow together. ⊙ Beiping Telegram to All Newspaper Offices: A telegram was recently sent to the Central Party Headquarters, which reads: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters: Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty years have passed, and chaos has followed one after another, with few peaceful days. Last year, Yan and Feng were pacified, and peace reappeared. Our National Government is strictly following the teachings of the Premier and holding a national conference to guide politics on the right track and seek the welfare of the people. We are working hard to build the country and consolidate its foundation. However, Chen Jitang, who is a member of the Party and a soldier, does not care about the survival of the Party and the country at a time when the national assembly is opening and the bandits are rampant. Instead, he takes a personal stance and sends telegrams to various places, destroying unity, disobeying Party orders, and not listening to advice. He recruits politicians and hooligans who previously destroyed peace and gathers them in Guangzhou. This is obviously with other intentions, endangering the Party and the country and harming the people. If this is not strictly prohibited, where is the discipline of our Party? Therefore, we are telegraphing to your department, requesting strict prohibition in order to rectify discipline and maintain peace. The telegram is urgent and sincere. The Beiping Special City Party Affairs Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party kowtows to you. We hereby transmit this telegram, hoping that all comrades in our Party and the people of the whole country will rise up together to maintain peace. We are most eager to see this happen.

<p>Bandits Take Advantage of the Mobilization of the Guangdong East River Defense Army to Invade Heping County Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to the influence of the current situation, the people of the country are paying close attention to the military operations in Jiangxi Province. However, according to local news, the 19th Route Army is still actively suppressing bandits in Jiangxi. Zhu Mao's main forces are exhausted and scattered between Longgang and Liantang. The task of suppressing bandits in this area is being undertaken by the two brigades of Liu Zhanxiong and Qu Shounian under Cai Tingkai's division. The fighting has been fierce in recent days. Recently, the rear office of Qu Brigade in Guangdong received a letter from Du Qingyun, Chief of Staff of the Brigade, which stated that the Brigade (Qu Shounian Brigade) departed from Xingguo on the 2nd to suppress the Red bandits in Baoshi, Fangtai, and other places in northeastern Xingguo. The bandit army in that area was the false Twelfth and Twentieth Armies. After three or four days, they were defeated by our army. The Brigade is now stationed in Chengtang. Our Fifth Route Army has arrived at the line of Futian, Shuinan, Baishahu, and Xixi. Our Twenty-sixth Route Army has arrived at the line of Zhaojie and Xinfengxu. Our Sixth Route Army has occupied Guangchang County. They are now continuing to advance towards Xiaobu, Dongbi, and Donggu to suppress the bandits. Most of the bandit army moved south of Ningdu a few days ago, but now they have suddenly turned back and gathered in Shigang, advancing towards Donggu, seemingly intending to engage in a decisive battle with us near Donggu. However, in total, the bandit army has no more than 40,000 guns, of which only 18,000 can be used. It is believed that they will soon be completely annihilated by our army. Recently, Chen Fuchu, Director of Cai Division, received two telegrams from Brigade Commander Liu Zhanxiong, reporting on the bandit situation as follows: (1) My department advanced to suppress the bandits in Chenggang on the day of Yu, and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits all day, killing and capturing over a thousand, seizing hundreds of guns and two machine guns. Qi engaged in a joint suppression of the Zhu bandits in Liantang with Mao (Weishou) Brigade. After a day and night of fierce fighting and repeated charges, the bandits were finally defeated, killing and capturing over a thousand. The remaining bandits scattered and hid in the deep mountains and are now being cleared. Special report, your younger brother Zhanxiong kowtows, grey seal. (2) My brigade and the Mao brigade jointly suppressed the bandit dens near Liantang on the days of Zhen and Wen, seizing a mountain of supplies and food, and many weapons. Hundreds of male and female bandits were captured. The bandits are exhausted and will soon be swept away. Your younger brother Zhanxiong kowtows, Wen seal. Since the bandit situation on the Jiangxi border is exhausted, it is natural that they are scattered to the Guangdong border. Recently, news was received from Dongjiang that Chen Zijie, a communist bandit from Sannan, suddenly led six or seven hundred men to take advantage of the transfer of the Dongjiang defense army to enter Bailing via Xunwu. The looting along the way was very tragic. They also took advantage of the emptiness of the defense army in Heping County and broke into the city, burning and looting dozens of shops. County Magistrate Huang is missing. Xiang Division has dispatched a certain brigade to rush to the area for rescue. (May 14th)</p>

<p>Nine Commanders Appointed to Be Responsible for Handling</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of Anhui and Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army Corps, recently, in view of the fact that the suppression of bandits in Anhui Province has not yet been thoroughly completed, has divided the province's defense into seven districts, as well as the Jinpu Railway Guard District, and the Anqing Provincial City Guard District, and designated troops to conduct separate suppression, directing the police and group bodies of each county and the anti-communist groups to coordinate their actions, so as to achieve unified command and divided responsibility. The names and numbers of the highest-ranking officers of the troop garrisons in each defense district are listed below: The first district consists of the counties in southern Anhui (south of the Yangtze River), and the twenty-six counties including Huaining, Wangjiang, and Wuwei, which are taken over by Liang Hongen, Acting Division Commander of the 57th Division. The second district consists of the four counties of Yingshan, Susong, Taihu, and Qianshan, and is taken over by Song Runtian, Brigade Commander. The third district consists of the three counties of Tongcheng, Lujiang, and Shucheng, and is taken over by Liang Hanming, Regiment Commander. The fourth district consists of the two counties of Lu'an and Huoshan, and is taken over by Yue Shengxuan, Division Commander of the 46th Division. The fifth district consists of the five counties of Hefei, Chaoxian, Hanshan, Hexian, and Quanjiao, and is taken over by Li Mei, Deputy Division Commander of the 55th Division. The sixth district consists of the seven counties of Lingbi, Sixian, Wuhe, Puyi, Tianchang, Lai'an, and Chuxian, and is taken over by Xu Huating, Regiment Commander. The seventh district consists of the thirteen counties of Haoxian, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Suxian, Fuyang, Shouxian, Yingshang, Huaiyuan, Dingyuan, Fengtai, Fengyang, Taihe, and Huoqiu, and is taken over by Wei Lihuang, Division Commander of the 45th Division. The Jinpu Railway Guard District consists of the area within fifty li on both sides of the Jinpu Railway Line (between Suxian and Chuxian), and is taken over by Zhang Lisheng, Division Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division.

<p>Organizing Shanxi Guildhalls Across the Country</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi Financial Reorganization Design Committee held its seventh meeting on the 14th in the meeting room of the Provincial Government Committee. The meeting was attended by Provincial Government Committee members Qiu Zengi and Zhang Weiqing, Liu Dongjiao representing the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Wang Taizhao representing the Chamber of Commerce, Jia Shuquan representing the Department of Finance, Bian Junshan representing the Agricultural Association, Duan Guozhen and Hao Qingzhao representing the Money Trade Association, Kong Zhaolai representing the Sixth Army, An Lun representing the Military Supplies Group of the Headquarters Closing Office, Yan Yuqin representing the Provincial Bank, and Li Shenshen representing the Education Association. Qiu Zengi presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the Provincial Government's adoption of the resolutions of the previous meeting. Next, representatives from the Provincial Bank and the Money Trade Association jointly proposed a plan to organize the assets of Shanxi guildhalls across the country to maintain the provincial currency. After detailed discussion, several measures were decided and proposed to the Provincial Government. Once the Provincial Government approves and adopts them, it will immediately begin to organize a committee to undertake the reorganization. According to prominent figures in the business community, "Shanxi guildhalls are seen all over the country, not only in major cities, but also in counties such as Xiangyang, Fancheng, Zaoyang, and Suixian in Hubei Province. Speaking only of the Shanxi Guildhall on Laoye Temple Street in Hankou, the existing funds are about 100,000 yuan, and the buildings are numerous. The value of the land and buildings in the north and south sections of Shanxi is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. There is now a Pingyao native living in the guildhall taking care of everything. If it can be reorganized, it will be of great benefit to the Jin currency. Secondly, guildhalls in Shashi, Yichang, Xiantao Town, Xiaogan, and other places, as well as guildhalls in Guangzhou in Guangdong Province and Guilin in Guangxi, all have assets. However, because they are public property, no one pays attention to them, and they are left to ruin. Even those who come forward to inquire about them only secretly steal public funds and do not consider the public interest. It would be fortunate if they could be reorganized now." It is not known whether the Shanxi Provincial Government will adopt this proposal. (15th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch:  The Red bandit Kong Hechong's band, after being defeated in Pingliu, retreated to Xiushui Tonggu.  They repeatedly attempted to invade Nanxun via Yifeng and Wanzai.  However, due to the strict defenses of Commander Tan's troops in Tongwan and Commander Liu's brigade in Yifeng, the bandits were unsuccessful.  Until the 14th of this month, Kong led over a thousand bandits, with 400 rifles, into Yifeng.  They were again met with a fierce attack by Commander Liu's brigade.  Kong then secretly fled into the borders of Fengxin and Gao'an counties in Jiangxi.  Gao'an and Fengxin are located just over 100 miles from the provincial capital.  Now that the bandits have penetrated so deeply, it's like they've thrown themselves into a trap.  Therefore, after receiving reports from the magistrates of Gao'an and Fengxin, the headquarters immediately ordered parts of Commanders Tan Daoyuan and Hu Zuyu's divisions, as well as the independent brigade led by Liu Yi, to encircle Kong's bandits in Gao'an and Fengxin.  At the same time, strong units were dispatched from the provincial capital to advance towards Fengxin in order to intercept them.  It is believed that the bandits will be unable to escape.</p>
<p>Donggu, located at the intersection of Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, and Xingguo, is a major bandit stronghold.  Peng Dehuai's band has been trapped there for a long time.  Currently, Commander Gong Bingfan's division is attacking the bandit nest in three routes, connecting with Commander Tang's forces.  Regarding the Fifth Route Army's Hao Mengling and Guo Huazong's units, on the 15th, they breached the Red bandit fortifications at Tantou, killing several hundred bandits and finally occupying the area.  The Red bandits at Wuhua Mountain and Tuolong Pit were also defeated.  The remnants of the bandits retreated into Longgang in Donggu.  The key passes near Donggu were thus taken by Commanders Gong, Hao, Guo, and Tang.  It is reported that Peng's bandits are now extremely panicked, and Donggu will be captured soon.  Once Donggu falls, Ningdu will be even easier to pacify.</p>
<p>The three counties of Ningdu, Ruijin, and Shicheng are still occupied by Zhu and Mao.  Zhu's bandits are mainly in the area of Dongshao Xiaobu Luokou.  However, due to the fierce attacks by government troops, the flags of the fake Soviet governments in various villages have been rolled up and hidden, unlike before when they were displayed proudly.  Many fake committee members are hiding in the mountains.  Zeng Shan, the fake chairman of the provincial Soviet, issued an urgent notice due to the depletion of food supplies and funds:  (1) All public and private property and grain must be handed over by the fake county governments to the fake provincial government for use; (2) All families must provide meals to the Red Army; (3) Each village must recruit 30 able-bodied men to form a guerrilla team to use a circling tactic to harass the rear of the government troops.  After receiving this notice, the farmers in various places, unable to resist, fled in large numbers.</p>
<p>Since the Nineteenth Route Army under Jiang Guangnai recaptured the county seat of Yudu, it has been garrisoned by the local police force. The Nineteenth Route Army is currently advancing forward. Unexpectedly, Yudu was recently captured again by small bands of Red bandits. County Magistrate Wang Jingming fled to a neighboring county. Later, large forces arrived to provide assistance, and the bandits retreated. County Magistrate Wang has now returned to the city to handle the aftermath. (May 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Fu Shuangying Discusses the Situation of the Jingxing Mine <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Daily Coal Production is Two Thousand Tons, Still Seeking Ways to Increase</p>
<p>Annual Revenue from By-Products Approximately Three Million Yuan</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch:  Fu Shuangying, Director of the Jingxing Mining Bureau, recently visited the mine accompanied by Secretary Su Changgeng.  He arrived in Tianjin a few days ago.  According to Fu's account of the mine's situation:  "The Bureau's various operations are all located at the mine. The mine's equipment is relatively complete, but there are many things that urgently need improvement.  I have already appointed De Maotang as the Chief Auditor.  This gentleman is of German nationality, but he is treated as a Chinese employee. He is also quite familiar with mining affairs. The mine is about twenty li from the Zhengtai Railway and has its own light railway. It has ten self-owned locomotives and over a hundred coal cars, transporting coal fifty times a day.  We have added two more locomotives, which will be transported and installed soon.  After that, we can transport coal fifty-seven to sixty times per day. Yesterday, I convened a bureau affairs meeting and decided on the following: 1. Save expenses. State-run enterprises in our country often employ too many people and have high expenses, surpassing those of commercial enterprises. After taking office, I have been determined to open up new revenue streams and reduce expenditures. I will evaluate employees, dismiss those who have nothing to do, replace those who are incompetent, and add assistants to those who are busy. 2. Increase production. The mine produces more than 2,000 tons of coal per day, but half of the workers are local farmers. Now, during the busy farming season, they have all resigned to return home to farm, resulting in a decrease in production. We have decided to hire workers from other places, hoping to achieve a daily coal production target of more than 3,000 tons in the near future. We will continue to find ways to gradually increase production in the future. 3. Increase transportation capacity. To develop the business, the first priority is to facilitate transportation. The biggest difficulty for the mine is the lack of vehicles. Only a few tens of thousands of tons of coal were transported to Tianjin last month, which was far from meeting demand. Currently, only three trains have been allocated by the Beining Railway and only two trains by the Pinghan Railway. We are negotiating with the Pinghan Railway to allocate two more trains, which is expected to be achieved. 4. Increase by-products. The mine's coal is the main product, but by-products are also important. What are by-products? They are the coke oven plant. Coke is made from bituminous coal, which is well known, but the various types of oils produced by the coke oven plant may not be clear to the general public. Here is a brief description: (1) The coal tar distillation unit produces nine types of products, including asphalt oil, red oil, and black paint. (2) The xylene oil distillation unit produces motor oil and crude xylene oil. (3) The fertilizer manufacturing unit produces finished products from sulfuric acid solution and sulfuric acid. The revenue from these by-products is no less than three million yuan per year, which is about the same as the revenue from coal sales. And the profit from these by-products is better than that of the main product, so we are increasing coal production and expanding the coke oven. (May 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Shenhai Railway Expands Towards the Chaofu Branch Line <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>And Takes Over the Jinggou Coal Mine</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Shenhai Railway Company is a joint public-private venture with a capital of 20 million yuan. In 1927, the main line was opened to traffic. Subsequently, the Meixi branch line was built. By 1930, the business gradually developed. It is now actively expanding the Chaofu branch line. The estimated construction cost for the Chaohui and Huixing sections is over 2.11 million yuan. Subsidiary businesses are also being actively expanded. For example, the Jinggou Coal Mine Company, which was jointly operated by the company and the business community, has been taken over for self-management. The company held its fourth shareholders' meeting on the 15th of this month and re-elected commercial shareholder associates and supervisors. Director-General Zhang Huilin reported on the business overview and work progress of 1930, as well as the work plan for 1931. Details of the Chaofu branch line, Jinggou Coal Mine, and business overview of 1930 are recorded below:</p>
<p>Expanding the Chaofu Branch Line: Huinan, Mengjiang, Fusong, and other counties east of Chaoyang Town, the terminus of the Shenhai Railway, are densely populated with forests and mines, and the land is fertile. They are renowned and prosperous regions in the Northeast. However, the mountains are layered and the transportation is inconvenient, so useful materials cannot be exported. The railway company therefore plans to build the Chaofu branch line to break the blockade and unlock treasures. In March of last year, the company sent Ouyang Ling, the former chief of the engineering section, to organize a survey team to survey the route from Chaoyang Town to Mengjiang, a distance of 90 kilometers. Except for the Chaohui section, which still uses the route surveyed in the winter of 1928 on the Chaoshan line, there are three lines surveyed for the Huimeng section: one from Huinan via Pubanshi and Sipenling to Mengjiang, one from Huinan via Shansonggang and Jinchuan County to Mengjiang, and one from Huinan via Xinkailing, Xinglongbao, and Sichaling to Mengjiang. The above three lines all have difficulties, such as excessively long tunnels, excessively steep slopes, or excessively long routes, and a decision could not be made at the time. Later, in early November, the associate director of the railway and the chief of the engineering department, along with Liao, the section chief of the Northeast Transportation Committee, personally surveyed the Huimeng section of the route. They all agreed that the line via Xinkailing, Xinglongbao, and Sichaling was the most suitable. It was immediately decided to adopt this line, and a budget for the construction costs of the Chaohui and Huixing sections of the Chaofu branch line was drafted and submitted to the provincial government and the Transportation Committee for review and approval. Construction will begin as soon as approval is granted. Budget for the construction costs of the Chaohui and Huixing sections of the Chaofu branch line: The total length of the two sections is 49 kilometers, with four stations, eight kilometers of sidings, and three kilometers of gravel lines, for a total cost of 2,119,900 yuan (excluding vehicles).</p>
<p>Taking Over the Jinggou Coal Mine: The Jinchao Coal Mine Company was originally jointly operated by the Shenhai Railway Company and businessman Zhou Wenfu. In July 1930, Zhou Wenfu, the general manager of the mine company, stated that the mine's business was difficult to develop due to the joint public-private partnership. He requested to withdraw commercial shares and return to public self-management, and was willing to value the mine's production machinery, etc. at 200,000 yuan, which would be exchanged for the railway company's stock. The railway company considered that the change of jointly operated mining was a major issue, and the decision was made after the 16th board of directors and supervisors meeting, and the approval of the provincial government was obtained to take it back for self-management with a valuation of 200,000 yuan in cash, which was offset by 6,000 shares. The railway company then sent personnel to take over the mine and named it the Jinggou Coal Mine of the Shenhai Railway Company, and appointed former manager Zhou Wenying as the mine director to manage its affairs. Subsequently, a letter was sent to the Finance and Agriculture and Mining Departments to send personnel to assist in estimating the exact amount of the mine's assets. The total amount of assets was estimated to be 695,835.363 yuan, and after deducting debts of 380,569.09 yuan, the total amount of actual assets was 315,666.273 yuan. The mine is currently actively planning to develop.</p>
<p>Summary of Last Year's Operations: The total revenue of the Shenhai Railway Company in 1930 was 7,623,039.16 yuan, an increase of 2,279,953 yuan compared to last year. The total expenditure for operations was 4,321,450.097 yuan, leaving a net surplus of 3,301,588.19 yuan. After deducting dividends, interest, and unpaid military transport fees of 1,743,974.15 yuan, the total net profit was 1,557,614.04 yuan. (May 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Harbin Merchants Oppose the Special Monopoly on Matches in Eastern Provinces <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Telegram Urges Northeast Authorities to Abolish the Special Bureau</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Eastern Provinces' implementation of a special sales tax on matches, with the addition of stamps, is about to begin. The two chambers of commerce in Harbin believe that in the midst of this nationwide abolition of likin, the sudden establishment of a match monopoly bureau and the imposition of heavy taxes will increase the burden on the people, which contradicts the government's intention to abolish likin and alleviate difficulties. Therefore, a meeting was held at the Binjiang Municipal Chamber of Commerce last night to discuss the matter. As a result of the discussion, it was unanimously decided to send a telegram to the authorities, requesting the abolition of the special bureau. The original text is as follows: The National Government has legally abolished likin nationwide. The highest authorities in the Northeast have strictly ordered all provinces in the Northeast to follow the National Government's order to abolish likin and not to increase or levy new taxes under any pretext. On April 3 of this year, the National Government also issued an explicit order to abolish the plan to implement special consumption taxes after the abolition of likin. Fearing that the provinces would not implement it effectively, the order was reiterated on the same day, stating: "The abolition of likin and all taxes similar to likin is a national policy. The competent ministry has followed the order to issue a circular to implement it as scheduled. If provincial governments are still disobeying previous orders to abolish likin or are creating new names and arbitrarily collecting taxes similar to likin, the Control Yuan should be responsible for sending personnel to conduct on-site investigations and reporting for punishment, in order to emphasize official orders and discipline." This order shows the central government's and your Excellency's determination to love and protect our people and resolutely abolish likin. However, unexpectedly, the Northeast Match Association has been approved to establish a match monopoly bureau and levy heavy taxes, with each small box of one hundred matches being affixed with a special monopoly stamp worth two cents. This is equivalent to levying more than 20% of the original price. Even previous likin taxes were not this heavy. The establishment of match monopoly bureaus by various provinces contradicts the cotton yarn, match, and cement unified tax regulations formulated by the National Government and is illegal and should not be established. Moreover, the imposition of excessive taxes is even more inappropriate. May we ask, what is the purpose of establishing a bureau to monopolize the sale of matches and affix heavy taxes on stamps? If it is to increase revenue, it violates the laws and regulations on the abolition of likin. If it is intended to resist foreign matches and protect domestic industries, the National Government has long established the Dumping Tax Law, which can be implemented by following it. There is no need to establish a separate monopoly agency, adding to the waste of resources. Protecting domestic industries should be tax-free. We have never heard of increasing taxes on domestic goods and calling it protection. Matches, although a necessity for all, even the poor, their value is related to people's livelihood. Selling matches and collecting heavy taxes is harmful to people's livelihood. We respectfully request that you examine and verify this matter and order the abolition of the Northeast Match Monopoly measures to comply with laws and benefit the people. Please reply by telegram after processing. Harbin Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jilin Binjiang Municipal Chamber of Commerce, bowing together. (May 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Disputes Over the Collection of Boat Tax on the Changhuai River <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Water Police Bureau Awaits Orders to Hand Over</p>
<p>The Ship Management Office is About to Begin Collection</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The Anhui Provincial Government has established a provincial ship management office. All ships in the province's Yangtze River basin, Changhuai River basin, and within Chaohu Lake must be charged license fees and registration fees in accordance with the management regulations decided by the provincial government committee. Even foreign small steamers must be charged temporary transit permit fees. In northern Anhui, the first to be affected is the Changhuai River Water Police Bureau. The salaries and expenses of the bureau's director and police rely entirely on the Changhuai River boat tax. The monthly recurring expenses amount to over 9,000 yuan. The eight boat tax offices established collect 5,000 yuan per month. In addition, the provincial government subsidizes 4,000 yuan per month, so the bureau has been able to maintain its current state in recent years. Now that the Provincial Ship Management Office has been established, the Changhuai River boat tax will of course be collected by the office. Once implemented, the Changhuai River Water Police Bureau will be cut off from its lifeline, and water security will inevitably be greatly affected. The bureau's director, Lu Fengshu, recently reported this situation to the provincial government and requested instructions on how to proceed. A telegram was received stating that half of the bureau's police expenses for 1930 would be allocated monthly by the Ship Management Office. The remaining amount would still be allocated by the provincial government. Starting from July 1931, the bureau's expenses would be fully paid by the provincial government on a monthly basis. However, based on past experience, the provincial government's subsidies to the bureau have not always been allocated monthly, sometimes being delayed for four or five months. It remains to be seen whether they can be allocated monthly in the future and whether the bureau's police expenses will face difficulties. According to Director Lu of the bureau, the bureau has decided to hand over the Changhuai River boat tax to the Ship Management Office for collection. Once the provincial government's telegram order is received, it will be handed over for collection by the office. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications believes that the Anhui Provincial Ship Management Office's regulations for managing small steamers are too strict, with high fees for license renewals, which conflicts with the Ship Registration Law promulgated by the National Government last year. The Anhui Provincial Government has been consulted and instructed to stop implementation or to revise the regulations to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. However, the authorities are determined to implement it, and it is unknown whether they will accept it. (May 18th)</p>

<p>Cooperative enterprises are related to the farmers' economy. The Department of Construction has been actively promoting them and has sent personnel to various counties and towns in eastern and western Zhejiang to vigorously publicize and guide them. The entire province has also been divided into eight districts to allocate work.</p>
<p>Most of the cocoon firms in various towns have suspended operations due to the impact of the financial crisis this year. Although the Department of Construction is trying its best to help farmers sell cocoons and has formulated relief measures, ordering various counties to follow them, the cocoon merchants have taken a passive attitude. Even those that have opened have mostly merged operations to save expenses. The cocoon situation is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, due to the expansion of routes and the shortage of vehicles, former Director Chen requested the Department of Construction to negotiate with the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank to borrow 30,000 yuan in cash. The case was submitted to the Political Committee for resolution. The current Acting Highway Director Huang has signed a contract to receive the funds and plans to send personnel to Shanghai to order new vehicles as soon as possible for transportation to Hangzhou for distribution to various routes.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to various trade associations regarding the issue of collecting accounts on three festivals. The Chamber of Commerce had previously decided that the three festivals of Lichun (Start of Spring), Xiazhi (Summer Solstice), and Qiufen (Autumn Equinox) would be the common accounting periods. However, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided that in accordance with the solar terms, the end of May, close to Xiaoman (Grain Full), and the end of September, close to Qiufen (Autumn Equinox), would still be the first and second accounting dates, and the day before Lichun each year would be the business community's final accounting period. Now that the summer festival is approaching, opinions are being solicited on how to determine the specific method. (May 19th)</p>

Yesterday, Qin Yiji and others, the creditors, learned that Ding Xingchu was at lawyer Xue Naichuan's house on the embankment, secretly discussing ways to deal with the lawsuit. They notified the creditors, waited for Ding Xingchu to come out, and went forward to arrest him. They were handed over to the first branch of the Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the General Bureau. Since the matter was a monetary dispute, they were transferred to the County Court, where Prosecutor Du of the Prosecutor's Office opened a court for interrogation. At that time, a total of eighty-nine men and women from the creditor side arrived, and Qin Yiji, Sun Yiji, Bao Juji, Xu Yiji, Ni Guanji and other five households were selected as representatives.

<p>Rice Prices Soar in Wuxi: In the past month, Wuxi has been experiencing continuous rain, and wheat has become hopeless. Therefore, japonica and indica rice have been continuously soaring in price. Various counties have also come to Wuxi to purchase them. Some unscrupulous merchants are also taking the opportunity to smuggle rice and rice stocks overseas. The bottom is drying up day by day, and the source is also small. Therefore, rice prices have been soaring in recent days, rising by more than two yuan per picul. The current market price of high-quality white rice is already 11.7 yuan, and the future of the people's food is very worrying.</p>

<p>Military Police Search and Suppress Bandits, Rescue Hostages: Banditry in the western countryside of Huzhou is becoming increasingly rampant. Kidnappings and intimidation are heard of every day. Now is the time when silkworm cocoons are being marketed, so the local military police in various places are searching everywhere to prevent bandit troubles. The day before yesterday (the 16th) at around 6 a.m., the Third Battalion of the Security Team stationed in Si sent many soldiers from the battalion headquarters to Lincheng Bridge on the Xintong'an steamer to dock. The soldiers disembarked and went to the Wunicao area, where they saw a group of bandits. The troops immediately opened fire, and the bandits returned fire to resist arrest. The two sides fought for about half an hour before the bandits were defeated and fled. One bandit was captured on the spot, one was killed, and one Mauser pistol was seized. The captured bandit was taken to the headquarters for interrogation. The 11th Marine Police Team learned that several bandits, along with two hostages, were hiding in the home of a resident surnamed Wu near Dawu Mountain a few days ago. The team immediately dispatched more than 30 marine patrolmen to the area to suppress and arrest them. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news. The two hostages were rescued from danger. It is reported that one hostage was the owner of a rice shop in Changxing, and the other was the son of a farmer from Nanqiao. The team has already notified their families to claim them. Furthermore, the Fourth Company of the Security Team was patrolling near the Heqi Meishan Railway the day before yesterday when they encountered several bandits carrying a hostage. The bandits, upon seeing the troops, abandoned the hostage and fled in all directions. The hostage was taken back, and it was said that he was the son of a Mr. Pan from Lincheng Bridge. Pan has been notified to come and claim him.</p>

<p>Cocoon Industry Conference Opens: The Jiaxing Cocoon Industry Association held a business meeting on the afternoon of the 18th. More than 40 representatives of factories signed in. Zhu Mou first reported on the current state of the world silk market, which is equivalent to 600 taels of silver per dan. Cocoons need to be purchased according to this price standard. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The purchase price of cocoons shall be a maximum of 42 yuan and a minimum of 38 yuan per dan. Each factory shall deposit 100 yuan with the association in advance. If anyone exceeds this amount without authorization, the money will be confiscated and used as membership dues. (2) The opening date for cocoon purchases shall be the 23rd in Jianan and the 24th in Jianbei. If cocoon samples are not seen by then, the date may be postponed by one or two days. (3) Existing local public welfare and educational donations will continue to be handled according to the old plan.</p>
<p>Marine Police Detain Suspects: The Ninth Marine Police Team stationed in Baima Weir recently checked a ship passing through the border and found a net boat coming from Jiaxing with two passengers, Wu Jin'a Da and Wu Fuchang. They had a package containing many clothes and ornaments. When asked about their origin, they were hesitant and evasive, seeming to be suspected bandits. The people and the goods were detained and sent to the Jiaxing County Government for investigation. The county government sent them to the Public Security Bureau for handling. According to Wu Jin'a Da's confession, he is 40 years old, from Pinghu, and has been working as a boatman. He is not a thief. Wu Fuchang confessed that he is 34 years old, from Pinghu, and is currently working as a bricklayer. The County Public Security Bureau, considering that it is a period of clearing the countryside, should thoroughly investigate, so they sent the people and the goods to the County Clearing Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>Ge Cisheng is Willing to Die to Repay the Bodhisattva: The wooden puppets of the old and new City God Temples in Ningbo have been destroyed by various party and government circles to eliminate superstition for two years. Unexpectedly, recently, a stubborn man named Ge Cisheng secretly made two City God Bodhisattva statues at home. Yesterday morning, he gathered more than a hundred followers and carried them into the old and new City God Temples for worship. The county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to stop them, but they refused to listen. The county party department heard the news and immediately convened representatives from military police and other agencies to hold an emergency meeting. It was decided to send a large team of military police to the temple to disperse the crowd and destroy the puppets. Ge Cisheng, seeing the large team of military police arriving, feigned madness and lay in the hall, claiming that he was willing to die to repay the puppets. He was then carried home by others. It is reported that the county party department believes that Ge's actions are reckless and incite superstition and confuse the public, and will write to the judicial authorities to detain and strictly punish him.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Changsha City Levies Entertainment Tax <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>To Subsidize Primary School Education Funds</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence on May 15: According to a survey by the Changsha Municipal Preparatory Office, there are approximately 40,000 school-age children in Changsha City, but only more than 23,000 are enrolled. In addition, there are more than 17,000 children who are out of school, all because there are too few primary schools and no place to accommodate them. To increase the number of primary schools or expand the number of classes requires additional funding. Guo Fangrui, director of the Municipal Preparatory Office, petitioned the provincial government to levy an entertainment tax to subsidize it. All cinemas, Beijing-Hankou civilian theaters, and dance halls in Changsha City will be charged 5% of the ticket price, effective from June 1. It is estimated that there are more than a dozen large and small theaters in Changsha, each of which can sell an average of more than 100 yuan worth of tickets per day, which can generate 60 to 70 yuan in tax, resulting in more than 2,000 yuan per month, which will greatly benefit primary school education. The collection regulations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: All those engaged in recreational and entertainment businesses within the city shall comply with the provisions of these simple regulations and levy a surcharge. Article 2: The types of entertainment tax are as follows: (1) Cinemas, (2) Beijing opera theaters, (3) Han opera theaters, (4) Civilian theaters, (5) Dance halls, (6) Large and small amusement parks (temporary park residents and various miscellaneous items without a fixed place are not included in this example). Article 3: The entertainment tax shall be 5% of the ticket value of each venue. If tickets are not used and seats are sold by other methods, this article shall still apply, and the tax shall be levied on the total amount. Article 4: The entertainment tax shall be stamped with an additional chop on the tickets of each entertainment venue, and shall be collected with the tickets at the time of sale, and paid to the competent tax collection office for verification and receipt on a daily basis. However, when necessary, each entertainment venue may submit a request to the tax collection office, which shall forward it to the Municipal Preparatory Office, which shall determine a corresponding tax amount and instruct the operators to pay separately. The method shall be determined separately. Article 5: When necessary, the tax collection office may inspect the account books and ticket stubs of each entertainment venue to collect the entertainment tax. Article 6: Entertainment venues shall not overcharge, underreport, or delay payment of surcharges. Violators shall be punished by the tax collection office, which shall submit a request to the Municipal Preparatory Office. Article 7: In addition to paying taxes in accordance with these simple regulations, each entertainment venue shall also comply with various regulatory procedures promulgated by the government. Article 8: If there are any matters not covered in these simple regulations, the Municipal Preparatory Office shall modify them at any time. Article 9: These simple regulations shall be implemented from the date they are approved by the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Results of the Secondary School Curriculum Standard Experiment at Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' High School <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since last year, Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' High School has organized a teaching staff secondary school curriculum standard research association. Based on the teaching experience of colleagues, regular meetings are held every month to objectively, scientifically, and carefully discuss and analyze the current secondary school textbooks and the teaching material outlines stipulated by the curriculum standards, compare their advantages and disadvantages, and then apply them to practice according to the stipulated teaching methods. The results of the experiment are divided into five major categories and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the objectives of each subject: 1. The objective of high school mathematics seems to be to add the habit of cultivating students' calm and quiet solution of difficult problems, so that they can face difficulties without fear and not be discouraged by failure. (Reason) In addition to striving for practicality, high school students should cultivate the courage to struggle and the spirit of solving difficult problems, so that they can pursue advanced academic studies or strive to serve the community.</p>
<p>Regarding the key points of each subject assignment: (1) In the high school English assignment key points column, the coordination of the procedures for ear, mouth, eye, and hand training is good, but high school English should pay special attention to eye and hand exercises. (Reason) High school English courses should focus more on the ability to read and write, so eye and hand exercises are more important than ear and mouth training. (2) In the high school mathematics assignment, actual application triangles should be added to measure nearby schools and other places. (Reason) Surveying is one of the construction works in the period of political training, which directly applies triangles. Therefore, when learning triangles, paying attention to surveying is directly promoting the application of theory to practice and indirectly cultivating the skills to engage in occupations.</p>
<p>Regarding the time allocation of each subject: 1. The intensive reading guidance time for junior high school Chinese should be increased to four hours. (Reason) According to the results of the experiment, the selected texts for intensive reading are relatively long and complex, and each unit cannot be completed within three hours. Shorter ones are slightly longer than three hours. If one hour can be added, the longer and more complex ones can be completed in one unit each week, and the shorter and simpler ones can be taught in two consecutive lessons, which can also come to an end within each week. 2. High school Chinese composition should be done by students outside of class. (Reason) High school students' composition focuses on thematic research and attempts at literary works, both of which require more than two hours of time. According to the results of the experiment, the time is directly proportional to the score. The scores of those who write in class are inferior to those who write outside of class. If the deadline for submission is limited and attention is paid to eliminating plagiarism and other malpractices, not only can students be allowed to create calmly and organize better articles, but also the composition time can be moved to other needs. 3. The time allocation of junior high school arithmetic should be changed to five hours of arithmetic in the first grade's upper and lower semesters, five hours of algebra in the second grade's lower semester, and five hours of geometry in the third grade's upper and lower semesters, plus a three-hour optional course in trigonometry. (</p>
<p>semester five hours of arithmetic, lower semester two hours of arithmetic, three hours of algebra, but in terms of arithmetic material, it must be connected with elementary school arithmetic and expanded, especially inserting application exercises related to the knowledge and experience of daily life, such as abacus and other materials are so many, students' level is shorter by one year in elementary school, and it is even different from the past, so there is an impact on the progress. According to the actual teaching experience, the first semester of junior high school is changed to five hours of arithmetic, and the basic concepts of algebra, positive and negative numbers, and simple equations are used to estimate a way to introduce algebra while teaching arithmetic, and the foundation is considered to be more solid, without the malpractice of being half-baked and mixed but not specialized. Then, when studying algebra geometry in the second and third grades, it seems that the obstruction of unclear concepts and unclear analysis can be avoided. As for the selection of materials in the trigonometry part, it seems that practical measurement should be the main focus, and a three-hour elective course should be set in the lower semester of the third grade to teach it, so that students who go on to school and find employment can get the best of both worlds. 4. High school mathematics, according to the general table, has 19 credits, and according to the sub-table, there are only 18 credits, so it is known that there must be a mistake in the middle, but according to the results of the three-semester experiment of the affiliated school, the total time is always insufficient, and it is not easy to complete the teaching material outline in the curriculum standard as scheduled. It is set to be 20 credits, adding one credit to trigonometry in the fourth semester and subtracting one credit from analytic geometry, and changing analytic geometry to four credits in the fifth semester. 5. The original time allocation for junior high school botany and zoology was set at three credits each, and the teaching materials and teaching methods were tested according to the prescribed teaching material outline and teaching methods. It is always felt that the time is far from enough. If you want to reduce the teaching materials to fit the time, then all the teaching materials set are very appropriate and cannot be abandoned. Therefore, according to the results of the experiment, at least one credit should be added to each, for a total of eight credits.</p>
<p>Regarding the teaching material outline of each subject: 1. The amount of classical Chinese in the teaching materials of junior high school Chinese should be slightly increased in each academic year. (Reason) According to students' learning status, the perception of classical Chinese selected texts seems to be deeper. In terms of recitation, classical Chinese is especially easy to achieve results, and junior high school is the foundation for cultivating students' classical Chinese skills. If the classical Chinese teaching materials can be reduced without being too much, the opportunity to be trained will be easier to obtain. 2. The high school English teaching material outline is still rich in content, but the grammar of ordinary English in the first and second grades of high school should be included. (Reason) The third grade of high school has rhetoric essentials. If grammar is not taught separately in the first and second grades, the foundation of sentence construction and composition is not solid, and the rhetoric essentials of the third grade are difficult to learn. 3. High school mathematics teaching material outline, regarding the equation group of algebra, the ordinary theorem and application of determinants should be added under item (B). (Reason) Determinants are the general method for solving general linear equations, and they must be applied in analytic geometry, and they are widely used, so they should be taught. Also, regarding geometry, the quadratic curve in item (D) should be deleted and included in analytic geometry. (Reason) It is not easy to understand when teaching quadratic curves in Euclidean geometry, and it takes time. It is quite suitable to teach in analytic geometry. Otherwise, if quadratic curves are taught immediately after solid geometry, not only will the mind be unclear, but it will also be redundant in analytic geometry. 4. High school and junior high school national history and foreign history teaching material outline: A. There are too many political historical materials. (Reason) The function of history is to observe the past and understand the present, and to use the gains of past human life, academics, and ideas as the basis for improving today's human life and social undertakings. However, according to the curriculum standards, it seems to focus on the historical materials of political dynasties, so it is appropriate to compress the historical materials as much as possible and increase the historical materials of people's livelihood and the historical materials of academic thought. B. Lack of central thought. (Reason) Although the history curriculum is inevitable from the flat narrative of facts due to the times, there should be a central thought to connect all the materials. For example, the Three Principles of the People in modern China is the standard for unifying people's thoughts. The history curriculum may as well use the origin or evolution of the Three Principles of the People as a central thought, so that scholars can learn with a purpose, and the historical materials will not be scattered and have nowhere to go.

<p>—Track and Field Results for Two Days—</p>
<p>Chen Sen Breaks Central China Record in Men's 100 Meters</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Jiujiang) The Jiangxi Provincial Second District Games commenced on the 15th of this month in Xunyang. Participants in the men's division include five middle schools: Provincial Fourth Middle School, Fourth Agricultural School, Forestry School, Private Tongwen School, and Guanghua School, totaling 272 athletes.

The chairman is Peng Keqin, the vice-chairman is Xu Yingshi, and the honorary chairman is Guo Su, the chief of staff of the Fifth Division. The venue is the Tongwen Middle School sports field. The track and field competition was supposed to conclude on the 16th, but only the women's division was completed on that day. In the overall school score, the Third Girls' Middle School had the most points, with 53.6, Ruli School had 30.3, and Nuoli School had no points.

They were scheduled to continue on the 18th, but on the 17th (Sunday), there was heavy rain all day, and the field was muddy. Even this morning (the 18th), it has not cleared up, so it will have to be postponed until one day after it clears up.

<h3 id="e97">More Stories of Martial Arts <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>—Green Pine Hermit</p>
<p>Shaolin is known throughout the world for its boxing prowess. The so-called Inner School originated with Zhang Sanfeng of the Song Dynasty. Sanfeng was a Taoist from Wudang. He was alert and used stillness to control movement. He did not reveal his skills casually, and only acted when extremely necessary. When he did act, he was always accurate and effective, with every strike knocking his opponent down. After a hundred years, this technique was passed down, but few studied it. This skill is now like the lost music Guangling San. Today, martial arts are flourishing, and Commissioner Hu Pu'an of the Civil Affairs Department is vigorously promoting them. Perhaps the Inner School will be revived. I have gathered stories from elders about several practitioners of the Inner School. While I cannot vouch for the value of their techniques, they may be helpful.</p>
<p>In the old Chuansha, there was Lu Shaotao, who mastered the secret techniques of Zhang Sanfeng. He thoroughly understood the subtleties. One day, he went out at night to investigate something and was captured by guards, who tied him to a pillar. A dozen guards surrounded him. Shaotao picked up a piece of broken porcelain and secretly cut his bonds. He took out silver and threw it into the air. While the guards were scrambling for it, Shaotao escaped. The dozen guards chased him but fell to the ground, unable to get up. Later, he encountered several soldiers on the road who tried to draw their swords. Shaotao was quick and strong, striking their shoulders. The soldiers were thrown to the ground, their swords falling. Shaotao ran away, too fast to be caught.</p>
<p>Feng Guanxiong of Shandong was exceptionally brave and agile, and was called invincible. One day, a monk visited and asked to wrestle. The monk looked fierce and spoke arrogantly, saying, "If you can punch me once or kick me once, I will admit defeat. Otherwise, you are not a man." Feng watched him for a long time, concentrating and gathering his strength. As the monk raised his fist to strike, Feng kicked him in the shoulder. The monk hit a stone wall, which collapsed, and his arm broke. The monk left with his injury, no longer arrogant. Feng was skilled in Yi Jin Jing, which allowed him to kick with such force, causing both the monk and the wall to fall.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiyi of Yunjian was wealthy. As a child, he was gentle and refined, lacking the air of a strong man. Local bullies often harassed him. Zhang was furious and wanted revenge. He went to a Shaolin temple and asked to become a disciple. The monk said, "You are a weak scholar. Why learn martial arts?" Zhang insisted, so the monk gave him an iron mallet and told him to throw it with the strength of both feet. He started with 50 pounds, then 100 pounds. After a year, he improved greatly. The monk then gave him a mallet weighing 300 pounds, which he played with like an iron ball, throwing it accurately and powerfully. The monk was pleased and said, "You have mastered the technique." Zhang then left the temple. The bullies saw him return and tried to harass him again. Zhang grabbed one of them in the crowd with both feet and threw him a hundred paces. The crowd panicked and tried to attack Zhang, but as soon as they approached, they were thrown. The bullies were scared and warned each other not to provoke him.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Rose Talk <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>—Chen Boying</p>
<p>The rose is a type of shrub, very similar to the rose. It is two or three feet tall, with thorns. The leaves are oval, the sepals are green, and the flower receptacle is cup-shaped. The flowers are purple, but some are white, though these are rare. The fragrance is strong. It flowers in early summer and grows everywhere, but the roses from Wuxing are especially abundant. When the flowers bloom, the villagers gather them and sell them in the city, filling baskets and hampers. The drug stores and temporary flower merchants in the city buy the flowers and dry them. The drying method involves spreading the flowers on a fine sieve and drying them over a charcoal fire. The heat must be just right; too little and they will be soft, too much and they will crumble. Only those experienced in this trade can judge it correctly. This lasts for about ten days and is called the "flower market." Once the flowers are dried, they are sold by the tens of thousands, worth dozens of silver dollars. They are used to make perfume, distilled water, wine, and sugar. According to elders, during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, there was a wealthy man in Wuxing named Song Haifan who liked to spend lavishly. He gathered roses and built a archway in his garden, three zhang high. The fragrance was intoxicating, and people flocked to see it. There was another man named Chen Wending, whose wealth was equal to Song's but who was competitive. He wanted to outdo Song and planned to build two archways to overshadow Song's. However, the flower market lasted only a few days, and despite his efforts, he could only gather half the number of flowers. Chen was furious and threw all the flowers under the Camel Bridge. For a time, the river water turned into purple clouds.</p>
<h3 id="e99">At the Leprosy Banquet <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>—Wu Yunmeng</p>
<p>Leprosy is not an incurable disease. If treated in a timely manner, it can be cured. People are unaware of this and consider it a chronic disease, which leads to delays and ultimately to incurable conditions. The disease is passed on to future generations, causing endless harm. Is this not lamentable? The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association is dedicated to leprosy relief with enthusiasm, painstaking effort, and unwavering dedication. It established the Hongkou Clinic first and then the Leprosy Hospital, benefiting the poor and bringing happiness to patients. Nothing can be added. Recently, Dr. Wade, a global leprosy expert, came from the Philippines. A trade delegation of overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies also came from overseas. The Leprosy Association hosted a banquet to welcome them. It was a grand occasion with many attendees, including Mr. Jordan, the Director of the Municipal Council Health Department, Dr. Patterson, the Director of Renji Hospital, Yan Fuqing, Diao Xinde, Zhu Shaoping, Li Yuanxin, and dozens of others. I learned many interesting things during the banquet.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese trade delegation consisted of eighteen people, all prominent figures in the local community. I met Zhuang Xiyan, the deputy head of the delegation, and shook hands with him, reminiscing about the past. We had a long conversation. He was straightforward and honest, and expressed concern about the declining overseas trade. He also lamented the fluctuating exchange rates, which made it difficult to earn even a small profit. If this continues, the consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, this trip to China was intended to join hands with the domestic business community and work together for development. He also said that the natives of Java are increasingly fond of printed cloth, which sells well in the market, and reject local cloth like dirt. They only care about the bright colors and do not care about the quality. They wear new clothes for less than ten days before the colors fade and the clothes tear. They then discard them and buy new ones. The natives are so simple-minded that their extinction is not far off. His deep concern was evident in his words. During the banquet, I also sat next to Wu Wenjian, who owns a large rice mill and is a wealthy businessman. According to him, he is illiterate and uneducated, relying solely on his own efforts to succeed. He has lived in Java for over twenty years and has never heard of a Chinese delegation coming to investigate business opportunities. Countries like the United States, Japan, Germany, and France do this every year. What is their intention? It is obvious that they want to seize the foundation that our Chinese descendants have painstakingly built over hundreds of years and control our destiny. He is also a patriot with deep concern for the country.</p>
<p>As the banquet drew to a close, Chairman Li Yuanxin gave a welcoming speech. Dr. Wade stood up and gave a speech, saying that the leprosy cause owes its current achievements to the enthusiastic support of the community. Leprosy is curable, but the problem is that it is not treated promptly. Finally, Wu Zhijian, the secretary of the association, reported on the association's five-year plan, including convening a national leprosy conference, investigating the number of leprosy cases in China, and drafting leprosy laws. His most alarming statement was that there are 2 million leprosy patients worldwide, and China accounts for nearly half of them. These one million patients are constantly spreading the virus, passing it on to their children and grandchildren. If we do not take immediate action to eradicate it, the consequences are unimaginable. The speech was thought-provoking and moved the audience. By the time the banquet ended, it was already past ten o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Notes on Domino Grass <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>—Qing Qu</p>
<p>In my backyard, under an old wall, grows a small grass called domino grass. Every early summer, it sways green and lush. Although it is not as tall as a table, it shines among the mossy steps, far surpassing potted plants. Its shape resembles ferns, and the back of the leaves has tiny dots all over. At first glance, it looks like dominoes. Botanists say that it is a cryptogam, and the dots are cells that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>I have consulted Qian Tangzhao Shuxuan's "Supplement to the Compendium of Materia Medica," which mentions fish and turtle gold star grass. Fish grass has long, pointed leaves, while turtle grass has short, round leaves. This is their difference. The back of old fish grass leaves has gold stars, while turtle grass leaves do not, even when dry. The small gold star grass has leaves like duck feet, with dots on the back resembling the suits of dominoes, but five or six suits are missing. In the past, Yu Yinfu of Deqing called it seven-star grass, which probably refers to domino grass, as mentioned in his "Chunzaitang Collection." Whether or not this is true, I cannot say for sure.</p>
<p>When I was young, during breaks from studying, I often arranged this grass in pairs until there were no missing ones. Sometimes I used them to play "Five Passes." Otherwise, I would put them in my books. Over time, the green pigment in the leaves would gradually disappear, turning purplish-brown. They then looked even more like dominoes, and their smoothness resembled ivory. They were pleasing to the eye and enjoyable to play with, so I loved them very much. This grass still exists, but it is not easy to transplant. It is sensitive to sunlight and thrives in shady places surrounded by moss. It grows and multiplies between the courtyard steps, and the number of dots is always accurate.</p>

<p>The Shandong authorities asked us what we saw here. One gentleman replied that what we saw that was good was not as good as what we did not see. The listeners did not understand. He said, "We came to the factories and did not see labor unrest. We came to the schools and did not see student unrest. The workers are working peacefully, and the students are studying peacefully. This is a great thing. We hope that the authorities can maintain this situation for a long time. At the same time, we should take this opportunity to work hard and make progress, and not waste this good opportunity."</p>
<p>Li Junyi, the magistrate of Shenyang County, and Jin Jing'an, the secretary-general of the provincial government, guided us to a village north of the North Mausoleum called Da Hanying Village. It was very interesting. First, we visited a small school with 116 boys and 26 girls. The annual cost was 2,318 yuan. The school was built by the school director, Zheng Rongxi, who raised the funds. The village has 240 households and 1,232 people. Almost all school-age children are enrolled. There are 82 illiterate men and 50 illiterate women. There are no unemployed people. The statistics and charts in the village head's office were very informative. The four wealthiest families have over 300 mu of land and five or six mules. Most are tenant farmers. The main crops are sorghum, soybeans, and millet. There is very little wheat. There is no rice. The villagers have made their own rules, and those who deliberately steal or damage crops or livestock are punished accordingly.</p>
<p>We entered a Liu family's home. Five brothers were all married and had children, but they still lived together. The eldest brother was a cook, and the four younger brothers were all farmers. The house was only one row facing south. The east room was the bedroom for the eldest brother and his wife. The west room was large, with four kangs (platforms) facing each other. The four couples, with their children, each occupied one kang, publicly displaying the meaning of the poems "Husbands and wives are in harmony, and brothers are united." At the west end of the room was the ancestral tablet, where the whole family paid their respects on the first and fifteenth of each month. This showed the simplicity and sincerity of their customs, containing much of the ancient ways. Outside the door, the small courtyard was filled with livestock, carts, and farm products. The whole family was busy with their work.</p>
<p>The old name of this village was Hanying Village. There is a story. In the early Qing Dynasty, the father of Yan Xizhai (Yuan), named Chang, was abducted to Liaodong. He died and was buried in this village. This is mentioned in the chronicle of Yan Xizhai. Xizhai could not find his father's grave, so he summoned his soul and brought back his spirit tablet. Today, the grave cannot be found.</p>
<p>Farewell to Jin Jing'an, Yang Ziwo, and other friends in Shenyang.</p>
<p>At the Hai Dian Jingtuo, I weep with tears. At the Zhaoling, the carved beams are still proud. The mountains and rivers are desolate after a hundred battles. I feel lonely and alienated in the wind and rain. My hair is turning gray with sorrow. Spring comes slowly to the purple frontier. What can I say about the twenty years of Kangji (relief)? I am already jaded by the cry of the wild geese.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Hawthorne's Detective Cases, Turning Point (19) <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne's gaze was calm. He took two puffs of his cigarette and slowly nodded in agreement. "I also feel that way about her. However, the 'god of love' and the 'fairy of secrets' often have close relationships. Besides, since love comes from secrecy, we can't casually add the word 'trickery'. That being the case, let's assume someone is unilaterally in love with her, without Pei Fen being aware of it yet." I responded, "This assumption is quite plausible. However, once we talk about unilateral love, the scope is also quite broad. Could that person be her male classmate, or a relative, or a friend of Pei Xian? Where do we even start?" Hawthorne said, "It's indeed difficult to start, but it's not entirely without clues. For example, that necklace could also serve as a kind of clue." These words of his once again stirred up my previous doubts. I asked, "I still can't figure out this necklace issue. We've assumed that he misunderstood because of unrequited love, treating me as his rival in love, and therefore plotted to harm me. In that case, the necklace would be an important element in the assassination plan. But how could he have prepared it in such a short time? If you say he hid it in his pocket beforehand, specifically to make things difficult for me, that doesn't seem logical either. What do you think is the origin of this thing?" Hawthorne lowered his head again and threw the cigarette butt into the spittoon. Then he looked up, a faint smile playing on the corners of his lips. He slowly replied, "This is indeed a difficult question. As I see it, this thing was definitely not specially prepared for you. However, before explaining this doubt, we must first ascertain the truth about this person. What is this person's status? What is their character? All of these are relevant. For example, if he were a dissolute, romantic young man, then the counterfeit decorations on his body may not be limited to just one necklace. If he encounters an opportunity, he uses these fake goods as bait to deceive women. This is one way to understand it." I nodded and said, "There are indeed such young men everywhere. These people are truly the enemies of women, truly deserving of death!" Hawthorne gave a cold laugh and said, "Why do you have to make such pointless sentiments? These few grumbles of yours, will they have any impact on society?" I sighed and asked, "Don't you have a second ideal?" Hawthorne suddenly stood up, his face grave, and answered in a rather cold tone, "If this young man's behavior goes a step further than romantic, and his aim is not only the satisfaction of lust, but also focused on the issue of money, then the role of this necklace is even more terrible." I asked again, "Are you saying that he prepared this necklace in order to use his fraudulent means at any time, to exchange the fake for the real?" Hawthorne did not answer. He glanced at his watch and said hurriedly, "Oh, it's past one o'clock. We don't need to just talk anymore. Su Ma, hurry up and make food. I have things to do after eating."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Gold Prices Rise Again and Again <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Continuing to Rise by Eleven Taels and a Half Yesterday, the gold price on the 19th continued its upward trend, soaring to new heights, advancing unstoppably. However, the opening volume was only around three or four taels. The total volume for the day was only nine taels in retrospect. The result was a sharp increase of more than eleven taels. The industry's will was high, and buying and selling were very different. The silver market decline immediately opened at a high level. Afterwards, there was a slight consolidation until foreign exchange rates, both domestic and foreign, showed profits. The listed price narrowed by one level. At noon, major players supported the market, and the Dalian gang and others competed to buy, exceeding the 770 tael mark. The future market fell sharply, and there seemed to be more sellers. Afterwards, remittance bills were even tighter, and the number of buyers in the market was constant. The British gold rate only settled at 1 shilling, 2 pence and 8125 to 75. The market's momentum was so sharp that it seemed to have the momentum to move forward bravely. The final count reached 774 taels.</p>
<p>Of course, it was smooth sailing all the way. From the opening of the July contract in the morning, it rose by 3 taels and 5 mace, reaching 765 taels and 5 mace. Then it rose by 5 taels. Buyers were booming. Fuyu, Dahongli, and others all entered. The large silver bar was also 1/8 lower, the silver price was 3/8, and the private telegrams were also the same. In addition, the United States was selling a lot after the market closed. Afterwards, the gold price rose to 69 taels and 8 mace. British gold was initially 12.875, and banks could do business in and out. Then it settled at 8125. After entering, Qianchangxiang, Yuanxing, Yongtianfeng, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, and others sold out, and it immediately returned to a small 3 taels. When the shilling was announced, it was 66 taels and a half. Although the listed price narrowed by 25, the US dollar was 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold rate increased by 2 fen and 75, it was not moved because the domestic market was flat. China Bank sold 875 to 9375, which only increased by 7 or 8 qian, reaching 67 taels and 3 qian. Yuanchunlong, Shen, and others sold. At 9:30, it was 66 taels.

<p>The yarn market is still tired, and the trend is calm. However, the U.S. cotton decline is quite strong, and the rumors about the current situation are getting worse, so some speculators are throwing it out. The seller's pressure is even heavier, and the market is difficult to improve. However, the sales of spot yarn are relatively smooth. The willingness to handle business in North China is flourishing. Due to the reduction in exchange rates, Japanese yarn cannot be imported, so it is purchased in Shanghai. The spot yarn market is better, and most futures yarn are bearish. Due to the unfavorable environment and serious rumors about the current situation, retail investors are unanimously shorting the market. The yarn market is currently shrouded in the atmosphere of the political situation, and the seller's pressure is heavy, so it is difficult to reverse the trend for a while.</p>
<p>Human Biao is Tilting and Falling The opening of the Human Biao market in the previous session was due to the drastic decline in U.S. cotton and the tired market atmosphere. However, the silver price fell again, so the market sentiment was still good. The three boards rose again, and the result was that each fell by 2, 3, and 5 qian. The opening in the afternoon was still tight, and the two or three boards fell sharply. Due to the surge of rumors, each fell by 4, 5 qian to 7, 9 qian.

<p>The cotton market is flat and tired. The U.S. cotton price has been falling, but the silver price has fallen sharply. It must be combined with the market price, which has risen secretly, so some attitudes are still firm. However, spot cotton transactions are dull, and the trend of foreign cotton is not good. The world cotton market is sluggish, the bottom goods are thin, the silver price is falling, and the future is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Han Biao is Falsely Falling The opening of the Han Biao market in the previous session was because U.S. cotton broke the 1 jiao mark, and there was still a one-month period that had not broken, so the market sentiment was very weak. However, the gold price rose again, only falling by 1 qian and 5 fen. In the afternoon, the bulls sold out this month, and it was rumored that the Japanese merchants had no intention of receiving the goods, falling by 6 qian and a half, and the far fell by 5 fen to 2 qian.

<p>Yesterday, the return of Ke Xian was fixed because there was slightly more at the end of the river. The appetite for Ke Xian on this street was slightly weak. However, some rural households inquired. The total transaction for the day was 1,300 packages, with prices ranging from 11 yuan and 3 jiao to 10 yuan and 8 jiao. The goods were slightly inferior, and the market was similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction of foreign rice was also weak. The new transaction only had the telegram price. Foreign firms such as Mitsui all sent telegrams, and the price of No. 1 Saigon ranged from 5 taels and 7 qian to 7 qian and a half. The reply telegram will only be received the day after tomorrow. The market returned 250 tons of goods, and the price increased by 5 points compared to the previous day. 50 tons of No. 1 Saigon was 5 taels and 7 qian, and 200 tons of small twisted rice was 5 taels and 3 qian and a half, which was 5 points higher than the selling price the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the opening trading of wheat futures was smooth and the market sentiment was stable. However, both buyers and sellers were mostly settling positions, so the market price was not much different from the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the amount of selling was very small, coupled with the rain, the price of gold rose sharply, and foreign wheat was difficult to be profitable. As a result, short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and long positions took the opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, near and distant futures saw a sudden surge. It is said that the supply of this month is scarce, or there may be a squeeze, and the rise is more intense, which may be the reason. Looking ahead, if the weather is not clear, it is really difficult to see a flat market. As a result, this month rose one penny and one point from the previous day, June rose nine points, July rose six points, August rose three points, and September rose four points, October rose four points.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Flour Market Fluctuates <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market was watching because foreign wheat quotations varied by about four or five jiao. However, the manufacturers still held firm and did not sell. Although the market sentiment was soft, the underlying strength was still firm. By the afternoon opening, due to the overcast and cold drizzle, there was no hope of clear weather, which led to the buying interest of inland merchants and speculative longs in the market gradually absorbing, and the prices of each month seemed to be brisk again. However, because the Fuzhou merchants’ longs sold back a huge amount of 300,000 to 400,000, the market momentum slightly declined. However, because the weather was not right, there may still be treacherous signs in the future. As a result, this month to July was two and a half li better than the previous day, August was one and a half li better, September was seven and a half li better, and October was unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Silk and Tea, Spring Cocoon Production in Hangzhou is Poor and of Inferior Quality <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Cocoon production is less than 30%... Mostly Thin-Skinned Cocoons</p>
<p>This year, the early silkworms raised by farmers in the four villages of Hangzhou County all died completely during the first sleep due to the cold weather. The silkworm farmers re-hatched late silkworms, but the weather was still cold, and the silkworm ants changed from time to time. By the time of the big sleep and prosperous leaves, there was heavy rain for ten days and the severe cold was like winter, resulting in most of the silkworm ants suffering from vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in huge losses. The silkworms that went up to the cluster were still shrinking and lying dormant due to the strangely cold weather, strong winds and rain, and the silk production was insufficient. The new cocoons have now been listed, and the overall pull is less than three and a half years old, and the cocoon quality is inferior, with mostly thin-skinned double cocoons. Only two-tenths of the cocoon shops are operating. The high-quality cocoons open at 46 yuan, and each shop receives very little goods.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Foreign Firm Silk Market Increasingly Clear and Firm <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market became increasingly clear and firm. The reason is that the European and American markets could not afford the Shanghai white filature and spun silk, and the opening price was difficult to rise. The manufacturers were negative because the spring cocoon harvest in the mainland was poor and the silk cost was relatively high. Yesterday, only Lien-Na and others imported 16 packages of Sichuan yellow spun silk, and Samsung imported 10 packages of white dried spun silk. The price remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Qimen Black Tea European Sales Continue to be Smooth <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, merchants from Qimen, Fuliang, and Jiande were eager to import black tea, and Jardine Matheson was especially eager to import. The total transaction volume of the city was 4,513 boxes, and the transaction was booming. The top price of Qinan high-grade tea was still open to 396 taels, and the market was firm. However, the market price of ordinary goods from Fuliang and Jiande was weak. However, according to the current trend, the sales will not be too obstructed, because the current stock of Chinese black tea in the British market is quite empty.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wuyuan New Tea Opening Price Initial Sound <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>New tea in Wuyuan, after each shop dispatched partners to the village to search for purchases, there were rumors of approaching negotiations every day, but the price was tight. The mountain households were unwilling to comply immediately because the tea production this year was蚀收, and the price was also reduced. Xin tea, known as the best water leaves, was priced at 55 yuan to 50 yuan per dan by each shop, which was a far cry from the previous year's price of 80 to 72 yuan, and many were unwilling to sell it cheaply. Today, Yintai in Beixiang opened the scale by the village Tongqing, setting the price at 40 yuan per dan, which is half the price of last year's high price. In the afternoon, Liujiaxia was opened by Xigu Gong, and the pricing was the same as Yintai. This is the vanguard of Wuyuan tea's opening price this year. The shops heard the news and recognized that the price was fair, and both parties wanted to handle it at this price. It is expected that the villages that have finished harvesting new tea will continue to open the price in the next few days. The new tea in Gaobo, which is connected to the border of Wuyuan, has been harvested and produced by each household, and the shipment is also more tender than last year. Although a few local tea shops have been trying to open the market, the actual financial exhaustion after the bandits prevents them from increasing their appetite, and the tea market has become oversupplied. Yesterday, Wucheng Hengda Li Tea Shop had already opened a sporadic selection of scales in the new building, setting the price at 30 yuan per dan, which was 20 yuan lower than the old price. Other shops also priced within this range. Most mountain households were unwilling to sell urgently because of the low price, so the number of villages that continued to make a price after the opening was still rare. The shops had a stalemate for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Qiupu Tea Market is Depressed <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Qiupu has always been an important area for the production of black tea. In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, there were more than 40 foreign tea shops operating. Since the sluggish overseas sales in the previous year, most of the tea shops have suffered losses. Last year, they suffered heavy losses again. Therefore, those with weak capital are unable to seek a resurgence, and those with thick capital hold a negative attitude. This year, the number of tea shops opening in Taoshu Shop, where the tea market is concentrated, has been reduced by half compared with the previous year, and other places are also rare. However, the mountain price this year has not fallen due to the increase in Qifu. The opening price of new tea is between 70 and 30 yuan, among which, the output of Fenliu, Xianglinwan, Yipinjian, and Yingxi is abundant and the sales volume is large. The other low-quality teas are rarely asked about. Each shop, in view of the sluggish Shanghai market and the abundant stock of British line tea, does not dare to import too much, and each holds the purpose of doing less is better. The trend of the tea market is becoming increasingly depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Tianjin Merchants in Pitou Purchase Fine Cloth <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Because of the weakening of cotton yarn and the unresolved issue of wharf donations, the market was sluggish. Yesterday, Tianjin merchants transferred and sold more than 300 pieces of fine cloth. The spot goods of Caiqiu were searched and sold for 7 taels, 3 qian, 7 fen and a half. Yanghe was also lacking, opening at 7 taels, 4 qian. The blue Shuangyu was more dull, at 7 taels, 4 qian, 2 fen and a half. The blue Chicken was quite brisk, and had opened at 7 taels, 2 qian. Fine twill fell across the board because the Guangdong merchants did not move. Yanghe was 7 taels, 3 qian, 7 fen and a half, and the blue Shuangyu was 7 taels, 3 qian, 2 fen and a half. The coarse cloth Hubei goods were successively arriving in Shanghai. The Tianzi was 9 taels, 1 qian, the Luzi was 8 taels, 6 qian. The 13-pound Yangtze River merchants were quite interested. The Magou was 6 taels, 6 qian and a half, the Shuangmashuangying was 6 taels, 6 qian, and the Feixiong was 6 taels, 2 qian. All have been purchased.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous rain, the East-West Pitou customer sales were sluggish. Although the East Exchange surged yesterday, the industry's thinking turned high, but the actual sales were still difficult to improve. The time has already reached the off-season, and the Donghuo's Tiaozifu silk is still lacking, so it needs to be released at 4 qian. The Zhigong wool fluctuated up and down. The Lieyan merchants needed 3 qian, 6 fen for the goods, Moganshan 3 qian, 5 fen and a half, and Shuangtonglu returned to 3 qian, 3 fen. The fine serge's customer sales have been quite silent recently, and the white crepe is still lifeless, because there is still a lot of stock. The Dianqiuxiang Yuanyangmiao once rose, but yesterday it was flat again, because it changes with the weather. The Baiti printed color Tingben Street has a strong demand and is still being purchased successively. The source of Western bleached cloth is still small, and the Tiaozifu silk has risen by about 1 fen with the Donghuo.</p>

<p>The transaction of black iron sheet has been quite deserted recently, which is caused by the order of the guest merchants. Recently, the business of the enamel factory has suddenly seen development, and there is also movement in the Yangtze River area, so the market situation has a good turning point. The standard has also been rising steadily due to the gradual increase in sales. The current market price of 26-inch, 18-sheet cargo is estimated at 11 taels, 7 qian and a half, 36-inch, 3 to 8 sheets are sold at 10 taels, 9 to 10 sheets at 10 taels and 7 qian and a half, 11 to 13 sheets at 11 taels and 5 qian. Although it was raining yesterday, it is said that the transaction still had as many as four or five hundred dans.</p>

<p>Zhang Ji Will Go to Guangdong in a Few Days</p>
<p>Sun Ke Will Not Return to Nanjing for the Time Being</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and went to visit Minister of Railways Sun Ke at Dian Li Ai Road at 3:30 pm to discuss the Guangdong issue and a peaceful solution. He left at 5 pm. After Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng met, our reporter specially visited Wu to inquire about the Guangdong affair and whether there were any concrete results in the consultation. Wu replied to the reporter that the Guangdong issue is still under discussion, and Minister Sun will not return to Nanjing for the time being, but has agreed to telegraph the Guangdong side again. The reporter then asked whether Mr. Wu would go to Guangdong. Wu replied that he would not go, and the Central Government is now sending Mr. Zhang Puquan to Guangdong. Mr. Zhang is ill in Nanjing, but is expected to leave in a day or two. The reporter then asked about the Central Government's attitude towards Mr. Hu Hanmin. Wu replied that Mr. Hu himself hopes to go abroad, while the Central Government hopes that Mr. Hu will stay in Nanjing and jointly take responsibility for the party and the country. Hu has not yet made a concrete statement on this. As for the issue of Hu's whereabouts, the Nanjing side has not raised it. Wu finally told reporters that the report that the Guangdong side has a plan to organize a military government, hoping that it will not become a reality, otherwise it will cause difficulties in mediation. Now that the National Assembly has been successful, all the construction of the tutelage period depends on peaceful unification. It is deeply hoped that the whole country will unanimously support peaceful unification at this critical moment.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The City Executive Committee Sent a Telegram to Chen Jitang Yesterday <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Pull Back From the Brink...It is Still Not Too Late to be a Hero</p>
<p>Go Your Own Way...Yan Feng Can Be a Lesson</p>
<p>The Special City Party Department sent a telegram to Chen Jitang yesterday, (the title is omitted) The founding of the Republic of China was difficult and arduous. Internally, warlords ravaged the people, and externally, strong neighbors were determined to invade. The old and the young were displaced, and the country was in danger. Fortunately, the comrades of our party, adhering to the will of the Prime Minister, were united and suppressed the chaos with one heart and one mind. We were happy to see the disintegration of the warlords, the suppression of the reactionaries, the peaceful unification, and the renewal of the people. We could work together to resist foreign aggression and concentrate on eradicating the communists. At this time of stopping the war and the people looking forward to a well-off life, it is unexpected that Committee Member Deng and others disregarded the facts, picked up rumors, and issued 30 telegrams first, and the comrades did not add to their thinking and echoed them later. What is the difference between helping the Red bandits to show their power and giving the great powers an excuse? In the past, comrades repelled the communists and contained the chaos, and their merits were in the party and the country. Therefore, the government relied on them with important places and assigned them special positions. They should not easily believe in蛊惑 and be fooled. They must know that warlords, politicians, and Red bandits are afraid that the world will be in trouble, and they will do their best to鼓唇弄舌, alienate and provoke. Comrades should expose the treacherous schemes. How can they be puppets, isolate themselves from the Central Government, and glorify themselves in the country? Even if they have any suggestions to the Central Government, they should submit them by telegram according to law and listen to the orders. How can they disregard the country, threaten the Central Government, and destroy unification for the sake of quickness? Those who lose their way will have little help, and those who start well will end badly. The defeat of Yan Feng is not far away. Our association feels the danger and dares not tell you. If you can pull back from the brink, it is still not too late to be a hero. If you go your own way, you will be condemned by thousands of people and bring destruction upon yourself. There is no time for regret. I dare to tell you my heart and ask you to think twice. It is fortunate for Guangdong Province and fortunate for the country.</p>

<p>Presiding Judge and Others Sworn into Office</p>
<p>The Case of Assassinating Yang Hu is Transferred for Trial</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Military Law Tribunal, jointly organized by the Songhu Garrison Command, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Jiangsu Higher Court, held a formal establishment ceremony in the auditorium of the Longhua Garrison Headquarters at 10:15 am yesterday. At the same time, the presiding judge and judges were also sworn into office.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives More than 20 representatives from various agencies and reporters from various newspapers went to the Garrison Headquarters to participate in the ceremony yesterday morning, including Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Yufen and Lin Tao, representatives of the Public Security Bureau, Luo Jingyou, Chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Government, Ju Zhijing of the Special District Local Court, Shen Xinyi of the Local Court, Zhang Dabiao of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, and Tan Shaoliang of the Public Concession Police Department.</p>

Then, Chen Hanzuo, the presiding judge, and Jiang Huaisu, Huang Daolin, Qian Chengjun, and Dai Yuanchuan, the five judges, took the oath of office. Then, the oath supervisor Xu Jinyuan delivered a training speech, saying briefly that the Provisional Military Law Tribunal was established today, and he was honored to participate in the grand ceremony. This agency was organized according to the order of the Central Government, and its main purpose is to use severe punishments in troubled times, and on the one hand, it adopts a system of collective wisdom to meet the spirit of a country ruled by law. The city is a mixed Chinese and foreign area, and communists and reactionaries are concentrated here, so the establishment of this agency is especially necessary. It is hoped that the presiding judges and judges will work hard and not betray the Central Government's entrustment.</p>
<p>Representative Speeches Then Tao Baichuan, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, saying briefly that the main responsibility of the Military Law Tribunal is the photography of the establishment of the Provisional Military Law Tribunal (Wang Kai).</p>
<p>Second, there should be no injustice, that is, we must be careful and prudent in the trial of cases, and do not allow any false accusations or unjust cases to occur. Second, there should be no leniency, that is, if the criminals are indeed communists and reactionaries, they should be severely punished and not allowed to be lenient. Then Luo Jingyou, the representative of the Municipal Government, and Gao Dengyu, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters, successively delivered speeches, which were mostly encouraging. At 11 o'clock, the music was played, the ceremony was completed, and the final photo was taken and dispersed.</p>
<p>Cases for Trial According to Chen Hanzuo yesterday, the outline of the organization of the tribunal will be announced in the next few days. In addition to the judges, there will be only five clerks. The candidates have been decided, including Chief Clerk Wu Chengchang, clerks Zhu Jiaxiang, Liu Wenqin, Lin Tao, and Li Jianhu. There are more than ten cases for trial, all of which were transferred by the Garrison Headquarters. The case of plotting to assassinate Yang Hu, the military attache of the National Government, is also among them.</p>

<h3 id="e128">City Sand and Gravel Industry Suspends Business <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>In Protest Against Taxation in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>More than 1,000 sand and gravel companies in the city suspended business unanimously the night before yesterday in protest against the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department's increase in management fees and property fees. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Suspension On the one hand, the suspension of the sand and gravel industry is to protest against the increase in donations and taxes, and on the other hand, it is to protest against Dachang's contracting of tax collection and monopoly of the sand and gravel industry. Since Dachang contracted the sand and gravel tax collection, it also established an Yitai Company to sell sand and gravel and build large ships for loading and transportation. Therefore, the sand and gravel industry, due to the increase in taxes, has to pay more than one yuan of donation and tax for every ton of sand and gravel sold at two yuan. At the same time, the industry has a contract for the sale, and the price cannot be increased. Since Yitai is organized by Dachang, which contracts the sand and gravel tax, it has an advantage. Seeing that there is no profit to be made, the sand and gravel industry automatically suspended business unanimously the night before yesterday to resist.</p>
<p>Public Association Persuades Yesterday morning, Gong Wushou, a member of the Sand and Gravel Industry Association, reported and went to various places to persuade the resumption of work. After all, this time it was initiated by the industries themselves, and the number of people was too large, so it was not effective. Therefore, the public association encouraged them to maintain order and wait for a solution quietly, so the order yesterday was good.</p>
<p>Impact on Construction Since the sand and gravel suspension of business the night before yesterday, the transporting, barging, and loading have completely stopped. As a result, construction sites have a feeling that there is no goods to do. It is said that the construction industry is discussing solutions at a meeting. At the same time, more than 50,000 workers in the trucking, barging, and transporting industries related to sand and gravel are also panicked by the suspension of business.</p>
<p>Appeal to the Authorities After the suspension of business tide occurred, the Sand and Gravel Industry Association appealed to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting them to uphold justice and avoid the expansion of the tide. The original presentation said that the illegal levy of exorbitant taxes has triggered a suspension of business tide, and I humbly request the Ministry, the Government, and the Bureau to uphold justice and stop the collection of such exorbitant taxes, so as to relieve the people's plight and stabilize the business. It is said that Dachang Yitai Company only seeks its own interests, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government Construction Department undertakes the production and sales tax of sand and mud, and cleverly establishes names and illegally levies taxes. I have submitted a request to the Ministry for a clear order to abolish it. Then I received a reply in No. 124, saying that the presentation was received, and I have asked the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department to investigate and verify it before reviewing it. After that, I immediately notified all members to strictly observe order and wait for a solution. Then, according to member Gong Wushou's report, now the two companies, Dachang Yitai, are levying exorbitant taxes again and again, and they are also detaining goods and arresting people and threatening in many ways. The industry cannot bear it anymore, so they automatically suspended business together to make a final resistance and organized a petition group to request a presentation. I immediately sent people to investigate and found it to be true. After many dissuasions, the crowd was angry and unable to stop it, and the exorbitant taxes were obviously illegally levied. The association had no choice but to follow the principle of protecting the industry and business and follow the crowd's request and submit a document to the Ministry, asking them to uphold justice and stop the illegal levy within the Jiangsu Province and ask them to forward it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to request a clear order to abolish the exorbitant taxes, so as to relieve the people's plight and stabilize the business. I cannot help but submit a presentation in a hurry and earnestly ask for approval.</p>
<p>Sand Households Express that the inland river sand and gravel households also absolutely cannot recognize this yellow sand management fee and sent a public telegram to the Central Supervisory Yuan, requesting impeachment. The telegram is as follows: Central Supervisory Yuan, Nanjing Central Government, The Zhejiang Provincial Government Construction Department forcibly collects 5 jiao per ton for outer sea and inland river sand and mud, and 2 jiao for management fees. The sand price has increased by 50% compared to the cost. At this time of reducing taxes, the department should not take the time to implement the central government's policies, how can it deliberately make a shocking policy of levying exorbitant taxes to trap the people in hundreds of unredeemable disasters. Moreover, sand and mud are priceless materials, and the cost is only the labor cost of transportation. And the amount of export, the outer sea and inland river, the situation is very different. The inland river often has the trouble of siltation hindering water conservancy, so the more sand is exported, the more the local area benefits. The outer sea sand has absolutely no relationship with water conservancy. How can the department not hesitate to make a big deal, set up a confidential stock, set up policies for yellow sand, and collect it uniformly for outer sea and inland river sand. Such a huge amount of management fees and sand prices make it impossible for the inland river sand to be exported smoothly, and its hindrance to water conservancy and harm to farmland is the most serious. This policy, which violates the law and harms the people, is obvious. Therefore, I send a telegram to the Yuan to take into account the public opinion and impeach the responsible officials of the department to rectify the officialdom and request the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue an order to abolish the yellow sand management fee and sand price, etc., to relieve the people's livelihood and maintain water conservancy. In a hurry, Xie Yucang and 112 other households in the inland river kowtow, Xiao,</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Telegraphs to Abolish</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Changxing County Government of Zhejiang Province collecting stone donations, the Shanghai Cement Company sent a separate telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial authorities, requesting relief. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Zhejiang Finance Department to immediately abolish it according to the situation. The original telegram said that Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, (Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department read) According to the Jiadai telegram of the Huashang Shanghai Cement Company, the Changxing County Government of Zhejiang Province illegally continued to collect stone donations after the central government clearly ordered the abolition of the Li. The Ministry of Finance issued a No. 12334 stating that the presentation has been received, and the Zhejiang Finance Department has been ordered to investigate and abolish it as soon as possible. The original text of the order has been copied and sent for your information. However, the county government not only violated the order, but also delayed its abolition. According to the Changxing Quarry of the company, the county government suddenly issued an arrest warrant and sent police to arrest the manager and pursue the tax. Such illegal levy is shocking. I am forced to telegram the Ministry for quick relief and ask the stone donation to be abolished immediately to comply with the previous case. According to the telegram received by the Ministry that the county magistrate resists the order to levy donations, it is very inappropriate. Please ask your provincial government (by the director of the department) to quickly forward the order to abolish it, release the arrested personnel, and return the taxes collected to alleviate the hardships of the merchants and pay attention to the merit order, and give a reply. It is very important, (you should follow the instructions and report).</p>

<p>Escorted Back to Headquarters from the French Concession</p>
<p>Wang Liujin, a notorious bandit leader from Xiaoxian County, commanded thousands of followers, possessing a complete arsenal of both long and short firearms as well as hand-held machine guns. He roamed freely and acted arrogantly. Recently, he fell ill and secretly came to Shanghai, using the alias Wang Jingxiang, renting a room on the third floor of Fuxing Inn on East Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. His movements were secretive, but the long arm of the law reached him. Deng Jingming, the captain of the Police Department's Detective Squad, discovered the bandit's whereabouts. Just as he was about to request an arrest warrant, the Provincial Security Department sent personnel with an official letter to the Police Department requesting the bandit's capture. The original letter was endorsed and handed over to Captain Deng for handling. Deng then dispatched detectives Wang Bin, Xu Pengfei, Yang Fengqi, and others yesterday morning (the 19th), along with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police, to Fuxing Inn, where they apprehended him. He was taken to the French Concession Police Station for a brief interrogation. Unexpectedly, even as the bandit faced arrest and awaited punishment for his heinous crimes, his fierce demeanor did not diminish in the slightest. He brazenly admitted his banditry to the French police. He then pointed at the detectives, saying, "I am only captured by you today because I am weakened by illness. It is Heaven that has forsaken me! Otherwise, even if there were ten times as many of you, I would not fear you at all, and would annihilate you all before my room!" His haughty manner showed his usual overbearing nature. The police station, based on his confession, handed him over to the detectives to be escorted back. It is reported that the squad has already taken him to Longhua Headquarters for further proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Gold and Silver Industry of Hanshi Requests Reduction of Business Tax <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Representatives Come to Shanghai to Negotiate</p>
<p>Sheng Runsheng and Yao Xuge Yupi, representatives of the Hankou Gold and Silver Trade Association stationed in Shanghai, came to Shanghai to negotiate with their counterparts to seek a reduction in business tax, and all agreed to assist. The association's petition to the National Government Executive Yuan (Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry) and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's transfer to the Provincial Department and the Business Tax Bureau is recorded below. The petition states that the tax rate for the gold and silver industry is too high, endangering its survival and making it difficult to bear. It earnestly lists the reasons and implores the Executive Yuan (Ministry) to review the situation, forward it to the Ministry of Finance, and amend the tax to be levied based on the capital of manufactured goods, in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and maintain operations. An investigation reveals that the provincial draft for the collection of business tax, previously promulgated by the Provincial Department of Finance, listed the gold and silver jewelry industry as a luxury goods retail business, taxing 0.5% of the business revenue. It was deemed that the listed taxable items were inconsistent with the nature of civil businesses and difficult to bear. A petition was submitted to the Hankou Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the provincial (imperial) government for consideration and to change the tax to be levied based on the capital amount. While awaiting approval, the Ministry of Finance approved the provincial business tax rate. The business tax rate for civil businesses was not only not reduced but was instead increased to 1% of the business revenue, exacerbating the situation and causing widespread panic. After repeatedly expressing their grievances, representatives were elected on April 9th and April 25th to petition the imperial government. They should have waited quietly for approval, but they dared not be silent again. As the provincial business tax is about to be levied, the tax rate for civil businesses remains unamended, causing daily anxiety. If it is not approved for implementation, survival will be hopeless.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Therefore, they dare not avoid criticism and lay bare their hearts, explaining in detail to the Imperial (Government) the differences in nature and practice between civil businesses and the prohibition of luxury goods sales, as well as the reasons why taxes cannot be levied based on business revenue: (1) Observing the gold and silver ornaments operated by civil businesses superficially, they are indeed a kind of decoration, not daily necessities. However, considering the actual raw materials used, gold and silver are commodities circulating worldwide. People purchase them initially because their quality is beneficial for practical use and can never be changed, and because their price is equivalent to modern currency and can be easily exchanged for silver. The intention is less for ostentation and more for savings. This differs from ordinary consumables that are used up quickly and from ordinary luxury goods that are purely for vanity. This is the first point. (2) Gold and silver jewelry stores have an internal structure divided into manufacturing and retail departments. Raw gold and silver are used as raw materials, made into ornaments by hand, and then sold by the retail department. Therefore, each store has a workshop, and the styles of the products are different. The process is entirely about turning raw gold and silver into finished goods, earning a small amount of labor as profit. This is completely different from ordinary retail stores that purchase ready-made goods from factories and profit from them. This is the second point. (3) Gold and silver are commodities used worldwide, and price fluctuations are determined by international exchange rates. Today, with numerous banks, price fluctuations are well known. Civil businesses sell based on market prices and cannot manipulate prices in the slightest. This is clear. Moreover, in modern fashion, luxury gold and silver jewelry is often avoided, with ordinary society and rural women using it more. Considering their intention to purchase with their hard-earned money, it is purely a form of small-scale savings, which is more valuable than using money for any other purpose. This kind of business that cultivates thrift and savings and hides wealth among the people should be encouraged by the government and should not be considered as having a nature that needs to be prohibited. This is the third point. (4) Gold and silver have never been taxed by customs. Even during the era of the likin tax, there was no item for taxing them. This is because gold and silver are one with currency and do not need to bear tax obligations. The establishment of business tax is originally to compensate for the losses suffered by local areas after the likin tax was abolished. The gold and silver industry has never had likin tax, so in fact, there is no need to plan for any compensation. However, as the government has new regulations for business tax payment, civil businesses are also willing to fulfill their tax obligations. However, taxes must be levied according to the nature and actual situation of civil businesses to be in line with the aim of abolishing likin and not cause them to collapse due to heavy taxes. This is the fourth point. In summary, the gold and silver ornaments operated by civil businesses are not only different in nature from consumables and luxury goods, but also completely different from the situations of prohibiting sales. Moreover, they were previously tax-free items and should be taxed according to the manufacturing industry, based on the capital amount, to be fair and equitable. In recent years, gold prices have soared, and the purchasing power of society is weak. In addition, women are competing to cut their hair short, and fewer people are wearing jewelry. Civil businesses are in a slump and can hardly sustain themselves. They are merely trying to maintain the status quo for the sake of the tens of thousands of workers who depend on them for their livelihoods. Generally misunderstood, they are often regarded as luxury businesses. It is not known that the luxury items among jewelry are not gold and silver but diamonds, pearls, platinum, and jade. These are all products of specialized jewelry stores and foreign jewelry stores, which cannot be compared to civil businesses that focus on gold and silver jewelry. The facts are all there and can be thoroughly investigated. In addition, modern commercial competition is fierce, and profit margins are becoming thinner. The profit margins of civil businesses are no different from those of ordinary commercial businesses, while the cost and monthly interest borne by the goods are higher than those of ordinary goods. If taxes are levied based on business revenue, the taxes borne on the cost of civil business goods will be more than any other goods, and the capital will inevitably be exhausted along with the tax revenue. How can they survive? Thinking of this, they cannot help but shudder. Furthermore, it must be clarified that society often says that gold and silver shops have splendid decorations on the outside and are resplendent inside, and that it is not excessive to impose heavy taxes on them. These superficial words are most likely to confuse the truth. It is not known that paying attention to decoration is a kind of advertising method in business warfare, and it does not seem that splendid and magnificent circumstances can constitute a reason to impose heavy taxes. This is explained in detail to the Ministry. How can the government's tax rate be based on appearances as the standard without examining the nature? This is also the actual situation that civil businesses cannot bear when taxes are levied based on business revenue. In short, civil businesses have always paid taxes and dared not fall behind others. If taxes are levied based on business revenue this time, it is indeed beyond their ability to bear, and it is not that they are not striving to overcome the difficulties. If they can endure the pain and support themselves, they will definitely not appeal repeatedly. They have long admired the Court (Government) for its thorough consideration of the difficulties of businesses. They earnestly implore you to grant a review and approve the transfer to the Ministry of Finance to revise the provincial business tax rate for gold and silver jewelry, taxing it according to the manufacturing industry based on the capital amount, to be in line with the actual situation and maintain survival. They are extremely anxious to await orders. In addition to submitting it separately, it is respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Provincial Department of Finance's Business Tax Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce for forwarding.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Silk and Cocoon Industry Should Not Be Subjected to Business Tax Again <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance Yesterday, Saying: To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Silk Factory Trade Association of this city stating that Jiang, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces have recently included the silk and cocoon industry in the scope of business tax collection, which violates the Business Tax Outline and Supplementary Measures. We respectfully request your association to unanimously advocate and support this. An investigation reveals that the business tax regulations proposed by Jiang, Zhejiang, and other provinces list silk and silkworm industries as a type of goods sales industry. When your Ministry reviewed these, these types were retained and not removed. Now, after carefully examining the various points presented by the association, we believe that there are indeed points that can be studied. As the special consumption tax has been explicitly exempted by the National Government, special taxes on silk will also be exempted. It seems that Article 1 of the outline cited in the original letter is no longer applicable. As for why silkworm businesses should not be subject to business tax again, firstly, when silk factories in the interior set up businesses to collect silkworms, they are peasant-like in nature. According to your Ministry's explanation, those who only buy and do not sell and have no business income are naturally exempt from business tax. Secondly, silkworm businesses have always been established with licenses. According to Article 11 of the Supplementary Measures, those who have already paid the brokerage tax, which is now called business tax, will naturally not pay tax again. Therefore, the association's claim that silkworm businesses should not be subject to business tax has a solid legal basis. We respectfully forward this information by telegraph, hoping that your Ministry will review it and instruct to make revisions, which would be a public convenience. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Oil and Sesame Industry Requests Reassessment of Export Tax Rate <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Telegraph to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Oil and Sesame Trade Association telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, saying: To Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance: We respectfully read your Ministry's announcement of the new export tariff, which sets the taxable price of tung oil at 21.099 per picul, with a tax rate of 0.75%, calculated at 1 tael and 6 mace of customs taels. The note states that it is based on the 1929 valuation. After reading it, we were greatly shocked. How can the export of tung oil from our country be based on the price two or three years ago? Exports fluctuate and prices rise and fall. Since the beginning of last spring, exports have decreased from 3,000 to 4,000 tons per month to less than 1,000 tons, and prices have plummeted. As of this spring, the price at the origin is only 15 or 16 taels per picul. The decline in business is evident from this. The reduction in exports can be verified by the export customs statements, which are not just empty words from merchants. The reason for this is that tung oil from our country is sold abroad, with the Americas accounting for 70% to 80%. It is now heard that tung trees are being planted in the United States and have already yielded harvests. Last year, they could produce 1,700 tons, and this year they are expected to produce 15,000 tons. The rapid progress of agricultural products in Europe and America is truly astonishing. This is due to the effects of government promotion and rewards. The export of tung oil from our country has a history of more than ten years. The most prosperous period was between 1928 and 1929. At that time, the gold exchange rate was still low, and the market price was always above 20 taels. If measured by the current gold exchange rate, even 40 or 50 taels would not be excessive. However, now the market price is low and exports have decreased. According to reports, the price in the United States was 12 cents per pound, but it has now fallen to just over 6 cents, with supply exceeding demand in the market. This has a great and significant impact on our country's exports. Merchants, seeing that the export of tung oil is becoming an arrow at the end of its flight, are in a state of bewilderment and do not know what to do. This year, after your Ministry announced the abolition of the likin tax, merchants celebrated the exemption of the harsh tax. The export of tung oil, which was on the verge of extinction, may have a glimmer of hope. They were planning to take advantage of this opportunity to reduce costs and compete with European and American products to regain the position of two or three years ago. Unexpectedly, the taxable price in the new export tariff announced this time is based on the 1929 market price of 21.099, with a heavy tax of 1 tael and 6 mace of customs taels. Using the rare market price of several decades ago as the standard for taxation is going in the opposite direction and putting a square peg in a round hole. Merchants are affected by the promotion of domestic cultivation by foreign countries and are constrained by the heavy new tax rate internally. Export trade is repeatedly hit, and declining industries are pushed into an even more desperate situation. This is contrary to the government's major policies of encouraging industry, promoting domestic goods, and selling abroad. The original export tariff set the taxable price of tung oil at 6 taels per picul, with a tax rate of 5%, calculated at 3 mace of customs taels, plus a 25% surtax of 1 mace and 5 fen, totaling only 4 mace and 5 fen. Now that the surtax has been removed, the regular tax has increased to 1 tael and 6 mace, an increase of about 2.56 times, which is shocking to hear. At a time when European and American countries consider tung oil to be a special product of our country and are competing to plant it themselves in order to resist it, our government should take drastic measures to reduce tax rates and support it, so that the dying industry can have a glimmer of hope for survival. As for the estimation of the taxable price, the cost of production at the origin should be used as the standard. Although it sold for more than 20 taels in 1928 and 1929, it was only for a very short time and in small quantities, so it cannot be used as a standard. According to the current market price at the origin, the price hovers between 15, 16, and 17 taels. However, foreign merchants have announced that if the market price does not return to the 11 or 12 taels of ten years ago, buyers will probably disappear from our country's markets. Although the words are exaggerated, the sudden decrease in export volume is credible. Therefore, if the taxable price must be reassessed, it cannot exceed 10 taels, and the tax rate can only be 5%. Otherwise, it will be resisted externally and burdened by heavy taxes internally. Even if merchants try their best to survive, they will probably be on the verge of extinction. If your Ministry believes that the established tax rate cannot be changed, then what dare merchants do to make suggestions? However, if export trade cannot be developed, not only will the tung oil export business, which has a history of more than ten years, be lost, but also the impact on export tax revenue will not be small. Increasing the tax will result in losses, while reducing it will result in benefits. We hope that your Ministry will choose wisely. We have long admired your Ministry's concern for domestic goods and the promotion of sales abroad. This time, in the revision of the new export tariff, there are many intricate details, and it is difficult to avoid oversights. Merchants' interests are at stake, and the public is in shock. The association deeply knows the crux of the problem and cannot remain silent. It has no choice but to take the liberty of presenting the facts and hopes to be heard. We respectfully implore you, Minister, to consider the difficulties of businesses, quickly revise the export tariff for tung oil to reduce the tax rate, and reassess the taxable price, so that the declining industry can be freed from restrictions and develop and benefit sales. We also request your instructions to be followed. We are extremely anxious to await orders. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai Oil and Sesame Trade Association, May 20, 1931.</p>
<p>Meat Merchants Still Continuing to Suspend Business</p>
<p>The local fresh meat industry has been suspending business for five days due to the slaughter tax issue. The following is a record of the various situations obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Finance Proclamation: The Municipal Bureau of Finance issued a proclamation yesterday due to the fact that meat merchants throughout the city have not yet opened for business. The proclamation stated: "Regarding the slaughter tax in the city, it was approved by the central government and used exclusively for education funds. It was previously contracted to merchants by the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office. Now, for the sake of unified governance, it has been transferred to the city for collection. On May 1st, the bureau's various collection offices began selling tax stamps and implementing the collection. A public notice was also issued. The tax rate is 19 cents per pig slaughtered and 20 cents per sheep slaughtered, which is the same as the tax rate when it was contracted to merchants in the past. Tax stamps can also be purchased individually for the convenience of taxpayers. However, there are villains spreading rumors that the tax rate will increase once the slaughter tax is taken back by the government, forcing all meat merchants to go on strike in order to gain leverage and achieve their goals of profiting and enriching themselves. Spreading rumors and deceiving the public is extremely hateful. In addition to reporting this to the Municipal Government and investigating the rumor-mongers for strict punishment according to the law, we hereby issue another proclamation: Meat merchants, many of you are discerning. You must know that the bureau's direct tax collection is to eliminate the evils of monopoly by contractors, to turn private into public, and to conform to the tax system. Since the tax rate is not changed, how can the burden be increased? You should open for business immediately, purchase tax stamps in accordance with the regulations, and not be fooled by others, hesitate to watch, and bring losses to yourselves. This is extremely important. Proclamation."</p>
<p>Bureau of Public Health Advice: To all meat shops: The bureau knows that you have been incited by a few people who want to contract the slaughter tax, blindly following and echoing them, waving the flag and shouting for those with ulterior motives, and even stopping business, becoming the sacrificial victims of those schemers. Because the bureau handles matters such as inspecting livestock, it has close contact with the fresh meat industry and knows very well that you are not making a three-fold profit. It also knows that you are often exploited and manipulated. As long as someone incites you with the good-sounding slogan of "leading you to resist taxes," you will not ask whether the reason is justified or whether the inciter has any secret schemes. You abandon reason as soon as you hear sweet words and obliterate your own opinions as soon as you hear exciting words. This phenomenon is extremely regrettable and pitiful. Therefore, the bureau published a piece of advice in the newspaper (see the local news column of the May 15th Shenbao, Xinwenbao, and Minguo Ribao). It is feared that many meat shops have not seen it or have not understood it even if they have seen it. Therefore, we are now advising you again, hoping that everyone will study it from legal and factual aspects and think about this matter calmly. You must act to maintain your own position and status and have a proper understanding, so that you will not become puppets of others. You must have the courage to accept good advice to be enlightened citizens. Now, we will divide it into several sections for you to think about: (1) The contract tax system cannot avoid the evils of corruption and profit-seeking. It is a termite between public revenue and the burden on businesses. As for the direct collection of taxes based on the quantity of goods by legal tax collection agencies, it is a fair and honest method. Now, the Municipal Government has first abolished the bad system of contracting the slaughter tax and implemented a fair and honest method. You should wholeheartedly support it in good conscience. But you disregard justice, follow those who want to contract and oppose the reform that conforms to reason. What is the reason? (2) Or perhaps some meat shops had colluded with the contractors in the past, privately compromising and reducing the slaughter tax that should have been paid, and sharing the public revenue that should have belonged to the government. Now that the contract system has been broken, they can no longer seek the advantage of sharing the tax that should have been paid. Therefore, they support the opposition. But is this behavior of infringing on public revenue right? Is this sharing behavior legitimate? What is the reason for you to support the opposition to the slaughter tax? (3) The slaughter tax was originally contracted by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to merchants. Now, the Municipal Government of this city has exercised the legal authority to collect taxes in accordance with the central government's resolution. The tax rate for tax collection has not increased. Meat shops are only changing the slaughter tax they should have paid to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government must also allocate a certain amount to offset the education funds of Jiangsu Province. It is not a newly created tax, nor has it increased your burden. What is the unbreakable reason for blindly following and opposing it, and for going on strike meaninglessly? (4) Someone is inciting and spreading rumors, saying that the Bureau of Finance is now collecting the slaughter tax and requires the purchase of whole books of tax stamps, which is inconvenient for meat merchants. However, according to inquiries made by the bureau, tax stamps, whether whole books or individual sheets, can be taken by meat merchants at their discretion and can be used to pay the slaughter tax anywhere in the city. How could everyone easily believe those inciting rumors? How could it be worth going on strike for this? What is the legitimate reason for supporting the opposition? Based on the above discussion, should the slaughter tax be paid in accordance with the regulations? Thinking about it rationally, there is really no reason to oppose it. People with other agendas also want to bring up legitimate facts such as the city's inspection of livestock and the construction of slaughterhouses to incite everyone and use them as a front for demanding things from the government, which is too sinister and shows too little respect for meat shops, assuming that they are all naive and can be manipulated and exploited at will. Everyone must not be willing to be deceived and fooled in this way. But because the inside story of the deception has not been exposed, everyone has been fooled and does not yet know it. Therefore, everyone should wake up quickly, no longer be fooled, resume business as soon as possible, and avoid losses. If there are people who use violence or threats, you can report them secretly to the authorities and request protection and arrest them separately, or report them to the police officers nearby. The police officers should definitely stop them. The bureau's repeated advice is based entirely on the pursuit of legal principles, deeply considering the pain of meat shops being deceived and coerced, and using sincere advice. It is essential that you accept good words and resume business quickly.</p>
<p>Trade Association Letter: The Fresh Meat Trade Association sent a letter to all sectors yesterday, stating: "Respected sirs, our trade association was ordered by the Jiangsu Department of Finance in 1915 to pay slaughter tax in accordance with the regulations. In 1926, it was collected by the Jiangsu Education Management Office at a tax of 3.9 cents per animal. It has always been contracted by the trade association and only collected from the trade association in the north and south cities. All those in the concessions are not collected. Therefore, compared with the trade association in the concessions, the trade association in the interior has suffered greatly in business. In addition, the areas of Zhabei, Shangbao, and the four rural areas are different from the urban area of Nanshi. The market is depressed. Therefore, the trade association in Zhabei and the four rural areas have always agreed on the amount of tax and paid it monthly, so they have been at peace for more than ten years. Now, the central government, in order to relieve the suffering of the people, has issued orders to abolish likin taxes in various provinces, and all local miscellaneous taxes are exempt. However, slaughter tax is one of the miscellaneous taxes. According to the central government's orders, it should be abolished. Our trade association and others were hoping that the central government would issue a general order to exempt it and reduce the burden. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Government has intensified its efforts, forcing all trade associations in the city to buy tickets and collect taxes per animal, which has led to the unanimous opposition of our trade association and others. In order to take care of national taxes and the aftermath of the trade association, our association submitted petitions to the Citizens Training Committee, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the various tax rule committees, requesting the Municipal Government to consider the difficulties of businesses and change the municipal slaughter tax to be paid as a national business tax, in line with the principle of one industry, one tax. However, the Municipal Government does not follow public opinion and still uses coercive measures, ordering our trade association and others to buy tickets and pay taxes per animal. Our trade association and others have said that under the blue and white flag, they cannot be relieved of their suffering but are instead oppressed by harsh taxes. Therefore, from the 16th of this month, everyone has successively suspended business to express their firm suffering. Considering that our trade association and others have always fulfilled national obligations, now that the central government has issued orders to abolish likin taxes, all industries are paying national business tax in accordance with the regulations. Only our fresh meat industry is treated as uncivilized and is still ordered to pay harsh taxes. We have no choice but to sacrifice and suspend business. We are deeply afraid that all sectors will not understand the truth, so we dare to briefly inform you. We hope that your association and all comrades will uphold justice and provide assistance. The gratitude will be boundless. With this, we wish you all peace."</p>

<p>The Da Zhen Collides with the Gong Sheng</p>
<p>Due to the continuous poor weather, incidents have frequently occurred in the Whangpoo River involving merchant ships. The Da Zhen Maru, a steamship of the Shanghai-based Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, was en route from Shanghai to Hankow. While exiting Shanghai and traveling in the Whangpoo River, near the Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Wharf, a British warship was anchored in the river. Fearing being hit by the strong currents, the Da Zhen Maru slowed down. At that time, the Chinese small steamship Gong Sheng was behind the Da Zhen Maru, also intending to proceed forward. Obstructed by the Da Zhen Maru, the Gong Sheng could not sail straight. Just as the Gong Sheng was trying to find a way forward, unexpectedly, the Da Zhen Maru, without regard for what was behind it, suddenly steered its ship to the left, and its hull struck the front of the Gong Sheng. The Gong Sheng was immediately damaged. Fortunately, it was 10:00 AM, and no one on board was injured. However, the damage was severe. Fortunately, the Gong Sheng was able to quickly dock, thus avoiding sinking. The Da Zhen Maru, however, was not damaged and continued on its way as usual. The Gong Sheng is currently being inspected for the extent of the damage, and repairs are being made. Meanwhile, negotiations are underway with the Japanese ship.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Hits Pier</p>
<p>The Dai Bun Maru, a steamship of the Japanese-owned Shimomura Kisen Kaisha, arrived in Shanghai from Australia with a large shipment of wheat. After inspection at Woosung, it began sailing into the Whangpoo River at around 4:00 PM yesterday, intending to berth at Pier No. 4 to unload cargo. Unexpectedly, there were strong winds and high tides in the river at that time, and the waves were very rough. While trying to anchor, the Dai Bun Maru was pushed by the currents and lost steering control. The ship was driven by the waves to Pier No. 7 near the Jiangnan Shipyard. Its stern then violently struck the pier. The ship's propeller was damaged, and the pier was also damaged by the impact. The losses on both sides are significant. The extent of the damage is currently being assessed, and repairs will be made immediately.</p>

The original Chinese manuscript is extracted below: "To whom it may concern: On April 7th, our national Xin Haisan was walking near Yong'an Street in the French Concession when he was suddenly shot without cause by Constable No. 158 of the French Police, the bullet piercing his neck, causing serious injury. Afterwards, serious representations were made, but the French authorities remained hesitant and indifferent. Such barbarous actions are rare among modern civilized nations. Now, the French are acting recklessly without regard for consequences. Our association, entrusted by people from all walks of life in this city, cannot ignore this major incident that endangers national security and violates international justice. Therefore, the facts are announced as above. We deeply believe that friendly nations will have a deep understanding of this case and render a fair judgment." (Remainder omitted). It is also heard that the association recently received official letters from the Taxi Industry Association, the Cultural Academy Student Union, and the First District Party Headquarters, all of whom expressed their willingness to serve as a backup for negotiations and to redress this grievance together.</p>

<p>She County in southern Anhui borders Sui'an in Zhejiang. In recent years, banditry has been rampant. Recently, cases such as the kidnapping of Xiang Yishan in Hangkou and the robbery of Cheng Gangfeng's family in Xialian have been particularly egregious. As a result, residents cannot sleep peacefully. It is heard that these bandits are all hiding in Sui'an. Although the people have repeatedly requested the authorities to issue strict orders for their arrest, these requests have been ineffective. Last month, Hu Weide and Wu Hanzhong were specially dispatched as petition representatives to Hangzhou to appeal to the Zhejiang authorities for strict action. They passed through Shanghai yesterday to request the assistance of fellow She County natives in Shanghai, urging them to appeal to various authorities to pacify the region and ensure the safety of the people of She County.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Public Announcement Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council Was Established the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Fei Er Was Elected Chairman</p>
<p>The newly formed Public Announcement Committee of the Municipal Council convened its establishment meeting at 3:00 PM on Monday afternoon. The following members were present: Fei Er, Ke Kesi, Ha Wo De, Tai Ke Lai, Wang Yingbin, and Watanabe. McDonald, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, delivered a speech, stating that the issue of publicizing municipal news had been discussed for a long time and had been raised repeatedly at the annual meetings of Western ratepayers. Most recently, in 1930, it was decided that the minutes of the board meetings and committee meetings, except for certain confidential matters, would be published in newspapers. However, the results of this trial implementation have not been entirely satisfactory. Therefore, this committee has been formed to discuss how to report municipal affairs to the public in a more detailed manner and to submit proposals to the board of directors. This is the responsibility of this committee. However, before you begin your deliberations, there are two points that I would like to emphasize and hope that you will keep in mind during your meetings. First, the Municipal Council's attitude that it is inconvenient for newspaper representatives to attend board meetings and committee meetings has been repeatedly approved by the annual meetings of Western ratepayers, and Mr. Fei Tang's report in the first volume also strongly supports this decision of the Municipal Council and the annual meetings of Western ratepayers. He has no intention of influencing your suggestions. The opposition to newspaper representatives attending meetings has become increasingly strong and may be generally accepted. Second, please pay special attention to the issue of publicizing municipal affairs in Chinese-language newspapers. It is fully understood that this may cause significant difficulties. However, it is hoped that the report submitted to the board of directors will have detailed discussions. Therefore, the scope of the committee's responsibilities is very broad. I dare say that improving the publicity issue is far more important for Chinese-language newspapers than for Western-language newspapers. On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank you for taking on this difficult task. This task has various difficulties for both newspapers and the Municipal Council. The directors and I hope that your deliberations will resolve these difficulties and satisfy ratepayers, newspapers, and the Municipal Council. Fei Er was then elected chairman of the committee, Ha Wo De was elected vice chairman, and it was agreed that meetings would be held every Monday afternoon at 3:00 PM. However, due to the holiday next Monday, the meeting will be held on Tuesday instead.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Emergency Meeting of Tram Workers <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Continued Struggle After Resuming Work</p>
<p>The strike negotiation committee of the tram workers of the Public Concession held an emergency meeting the night before last. It was believed that the company insisted on a tough attitude, using the recent arrest incident as an excuse that it had nothing to do with the company, and that it was obviously insincere in directly negotiating with the workers to resolve the five demands of suffering. It was also believed that the internal unity of the workers was still lacking. More than 600 workers had to resume work on the 18th. However, the lessons of this strike failure, and the enthusiasm of the workers at that time, will continue to resist until all the demands are fully realized. Therefore, the following was decided: (1) Immediately issue a declaration of resuming work with patience in the name of the negotiation committee, and thank letters of assistance from all walks of life. (2) Convene meetings in each department to discuss methods of continued struggle, strictly criticize and dismiss wavering representatives, elect representatives, re-elect the negotiation committee, and carry out lower-level small group organization. In the next few days, convene a meeting of representatives from each department to discuss together. (3) Send representatives to the Huishan, Jing'an Temple, and driving and ticket-selling workers to continue actively contacting them and request unified resistance.</p>

<p>Passengers Should Avoid Acting as Accomplices</p>
<p>Zhuang Linshi, a woman from Danyang, originally fell into prostitution in Nanjing. Later, Wei Dehui, the owner of a construction company, redeemed her and brought her to Shanghai to live with him. After about a year, she met Jiang Wenmei, an old acquaintance, and recounted her past. From then on, they became very close again and rekindled their old relationship. Moreover, Jiang had a large amount of money and spent it lavishly. He then had Linshi divorce Wei. The case was brought before the Special District Court, which ultimately ruled that Wei and Lin were no longer husband and wife. Wenmei then took Lin as his concubine. However, his wife at home was very strict, so Wenmei rented another house to hide her. Wenmei had a son from his original wife, who was now grown. Unexpectedly, Linshi also gave birth to a son, who was still an infant. This was discovered by the wife and her eldest son, who feared that he would grow up and share the family property. They forced Wenmei to divorce Linshi to avoid future trouble. Wenmei was naturally henpecked and gradually became distant from Linshi, but he still felt reluctant to let her go. Linshi lived with her mother's family upstairs in Zhang Lianji's Western clothing store on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. One day, she met Wenmei on the street and was invited to spend the night with him in a room at the Hong Kong Hotel. The son that Linshi had given birth to was cared for by a wet nurse at her mother's house. Unexpectedly, the wife and her eldest son learned of this and took advantage of her absence to go to the Songshan Road police station and falsely report that there was a kidnapping ring upstairs in Zhang Lianji's building. The head of the police station sent detectives to arrest Linshi's brothers, Lin A'ao and Lin Xiaofu, and her younger sisters, Wang Yuexian and others. After questioning them, the head of the police station learned the truth and realized that it was a malicious accusation. He immediately ordered their release on bail. Linshi's child was left to starve for a day and night because the wet nurse had fled. It is now heard that Linshi has hired a lawyer to sue the wife and her eldest son for their malicious actions.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Depart from Shanghai on July 1st and Complete the Journey in Six Years</p>
<p>Using a Bicycle on Flat Ground and Carrying the Bicycle When Walking Mountain Paths</p>
<p>Tian Shugang, a native of Hunan, studied at the China University in Beiping for two years and is currently a professor at the Minzhi Middle School on Weihaiwei Road in Shanghai. Recently, Mr. Tian resolved to spend six years traveling around the country to collect information on customs and practices. He is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on July 1st. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Tian yesterday afternoon to inquire about the purpose of his trip, the objectives of his research, and his contribution to society after completing his journey around the country. He replied as follows: "I (Tian Shugang referring to himself) am from Liling. From a young age, I had ambitions to travel far. When I was studying in Beiping, I planned to fulfill my dream of traveling around the country, but I had other commitments. I lived in Shaanxi Province for more than a year. In the past two months, I have been planning the route across the country and decided to leave Shanghai on July 1st to travel around the country by bicycle. If I encounter small paths, I will disassemble the bicycle, tie it up, and carry it on my shoulders. By the end of this year, the journey will take me through Hangzhou, Yanping, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Longyan, Shanghang, Shantou, Huizhou, Guangzhou, Shaozhou, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Macau, Sanshui, Zhaoqing, Yangjiang, Leizhou, Qiongzhou, and other places. From the 21st to the 24th year of the Republic, I will go to Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang, Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, and Sichuan. Then, in two years, I will travel through the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, and Jiangsu, and then return to Shanghai. The purpose of my travels is to investigate the location, evolution, situation, geography, climate, and current status of industry and transportation in cities across the country. I will investigate the population size and culture of each place, including schools, educational institutions, industries, newspapers, libraries, museums, and other municipal constructions. In terms of scenic spots, I will examine mountains, rivers, lakes, rocks, caves, springs, sandbars, fjords, ponds, hills, tombs, pagodas, pavilions, temples, etc. I will also examine the general living conditions and customs of each place, including clothing, food, housing, and utensils. I will conduct a factual and detailed investigation, without making strange or sensational descriptions. I will write everything down in my travel notes. After completing my journey around the country, I will write a book for people to refer to and choose from. However, the four years in the middle of my journey will be more difficult. For example, when I arrive in Sichuan Province after four years, the purpose of my journey around the country will not be a problem. The difficulty of this trip lies in the Miao people of Guizhou, the Yao people of Guangxi, the Li people of Hainan Island, and the Yi people of Yunnan. I want to experience their lives firsthand and observe their lives. I will ask local Han people from each province to introduce me to the familiar Miao, Yao, Li, and Yi people, and explore their general living conditions. I will also investigate the residences and lifestyles of the wild Miao, wild Yao, wild Li, and wild Yi people in the mountains. If I can understand everything thoroughly, I will then climb the highest peak of the Himalayas, Mount Everest, and Lake Yik, which is 17,000 feet above sea level, and explore the headwaters of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. My wish is to do what others consider difficult and unwilling to do. I am determined to create a new record!" At this point, Mr. Tian had to leave to teach a class, so the reporter said goodbye and left.</p>

<p>Head Hits a Utility Pole and She Dies Tragically</p>
<p>At around 10:45 AM yesterday, a girl, about 14 or 15 years old, was riding a trolleybus traveling from east to west. When the trolleybus passed near the intersection of Avenue Road and Chengdu Road, because the road was under construction there, the trolleybus was driving close to the side of the road. The girl suddenly became curious and leaned out of the window to see what was happening. Unexpectedly, the trolleybus moved forward, and her head hit a utility pole on the side of the road. She was unable to avoid it in time and suffered a severe blow. Her head was broken and bleeding, and she fell back into her seat. By the time she was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, she had already died. Her body was sent to the coroner's office for examination and will be reported to the court for inspection today.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Trial Opens in the Case of the Young Owner of Hongtai Factory Being Accused of Abandonment by His Concubine <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Huang Qingrong, the young owner of Hongtai Construction Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, lives at No. 1056 Yongtai Lane, Xinza Road. He was recently sued in the Special District Court by Huang Huangshi (32 years old), a woman from his native place, for abandonment. The lawsuit was filed by lawyer Xi Shichang. The lawsuit states that the plaintiff, Huang Huangshi, lived in the home of a Mr. Jin at No. 1074 Yongtai Lane, Xinza Road, in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic. Huang Qingrong, the landlord of the house, saw that the plaintiff was attractive and often came to flirt with her. He falsely claimed that he was not yet married and wanted to marry the plaintiff. The plaintiff believed him and was forced into an illicit relationship. About a month later, the plaintiff discovered that the defendant was already married and confronted him,责责ing him for lying and seducing women. The defendant knew he was in the wrong and expressed his apology, asking the plaintiff not to sue him. He also said that even if the plaintiff was not his wife, she could be his concubine. The plaintiff felt that what was done could not be undone, and so she let the matter drop. The defendant then gave the plaintiff 100 yuan per month for household expenses. In May of last year, she gave birth to a daughter, who was named Xiao Rong by the defendant. The living expenses were also increased from 100 yuan to 140 yuan. They lived together in this way, and their relationship was very good. The defendant's family members also came to visit from time to time, and there was never any gossip. However, in recent months, the defendant, having found another love, suddenly abandoned the plaintiff and her daughter, giving them no money and not coming home to live. When she went to him to ask for expenses, he shouted at her and refused to let her in. The plaintiff has children to raise and household affairs to take care of, and she cannot support herself. Therefore, all household expenses are dependent on the defendant. However, the defendant, having millions in assets, indulges in new loves and treats his wives and concubines like discarded shoes. He does not support his children, putting the lives of the plaintiff and her daughter in danger. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit, requesting that the defendant be punished under Article 310 of the criminal code and ordered to pay 20,000 yuan for the living expenses of the plaintiff and her daughter. According to the lawsuit, the court issued a summons and sent it to the police station to be served at the address. However, the summons was refused, and it was said that there was no such person. Therefore, when the case was heard in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Ge Zhitan yesterday afternoon, the defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Huang Huangshi, brought her two-year-old daughter, Xiao Rong, to court and explained everything. Judge Ge ordered that the defendant be arrested and brought to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Three Thieves Arrested</p>
<p>A Copy of the Twenty-Four Histories Recovered</p>
<p>On the night of the 11th of this month, while the students were sound asleep, thieves broke into Room No. 5 of the student dormitory at Sanxin Lane, Zhongshan Road, West Shanghai, which belongs to Datong University, and stole three leather suitcases containing more than ten silk and leather garments. After the students realized what had happened, they filed a report with the Sixth District Police Station. After receiving the report, District Chief Ren ordered the detectives stationed in the district to investigate the case. Unexpectedly, on the night before last, three large leather suitcases were stolen from Dormitory No. 11 in the same lane. Just as they were being carried out, they were spotted by the watchman, who immediately stepped forward and arrested one of the thieves and recovered the stolen goods. He was then taken to the Sixth District Police Station. According to the thief, whose name is Xu Heshang, 25 years old, from Nanjing, he admitted the theft and stated that his accomplices included Wang Shaomei, who was hiding in Hujia Lane in the city. District Chief Ren then ordered Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing, along with detectives Gan Youxin, Wu Rui, Tang Bingxiang, Sun Rongxuan, and Cao Chuqiao, to go to No. 21 Hujia Lane in the city, where they arrested Wang Shaomei (the thief was wearing a Western-style suit and leather shoes and was very handsome). They also went to No. 90 Jiangyin Street, where they arrested Lu Weixin, and recovered a copy of the Twenty-Four Histories. They were all taken back to the police station. After preliminary interrogation by District Chief Ren, they all confessed to conspiring to steal from the dormitory twice. The stolen goods were all pawned at various pawnshops in the concession. Yesterday, the detectives recovered all of the stolen goods and returned them to the students. They then prepared a document and sent the three thieves to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>At about 8:00 PM the night before last, the Yangshupu police station sent two Japanese constables, No. 154 and No. 146, to patrol within their jurisdiction. Near Pingliang Road and Linqing Road, they saw a man running towards them, who looked suspicious. Just as they were about to step forward to search him, the man turned around and tried to escape, and pulled out a pistol and fired a shot to resist arrest. The constables then drew their guns and fired several shots in succession, hitting him in vital organs and killing him instantly. The body was sent to the coroner's office to await examination. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Huaipu of the Special District Court arrived at the scene to examine the body. He took his seat and heard the report from Japanese Constable No. 154, who stated that he saw a suspicious person on Linqing Road and was about to search him. The person reached into his pocket, as if to grab a pistol. Japanese Constable No. 146 grabbed the sleeves of both arms. However, the person was unusually strong and managed to escape. He then fired a shot to resist arrest, and the constables fired twelve shots in succession, killing him. Japanese Constable No. 146 then reported the situation. Judge Guo declared that the examination confirmed that the unidentified bandit had been shot and killed while resisting arrest, and ordered that the Pushan Villa provide a coffin and burial.</p>
<p>The Golden Rat brand cigarettes produced by the China Tobacco Company have been widely sold. Recently, there have been profiteers who imitate and manufacture them, and have lowered their price, encroaching on the sales channels. Zhu Guisheng, an investigator of the company, investigated for a long time and finally discovered the clues. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, he went to guard the entrance of the Datong Yutong Co., Ltd. at No. 513 Zhejiang Road. Soon, he saw two Ningbo natives, Ge Zhixin and Ge Guofang, bring 63 boxes of Golden Rat brand cigarettes, totaling 15,750 cigarettes, to the company for sale, asking for a price of one yuan per box. Zhu immediately chased after them and carefully inspected them, realizing that they were counterfeit products. When asked about their origin, the two Ge hesitated and stumbled, but admitted that they were counterfeit. Zhu then rushed to the Old Gate police station and sent detectives to bring the two Ge and the counterfeit cigarettes back to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the Special District Court, where they were interrogated by Judge Shen Shumu. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, requested an adjournment so that the location of manufacture and the manufacturer could be investigated. Judge Shen then briefly questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be detained pending investigation and verification at a later date.</p>

<p>Li Changyong, a patrol officer from the First District, First Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, saw a girl, about ten years old, wearing a striped cotton jacket and cotton pants, and blue cotton socks and cloth shoes, wandering around Xinmatou Street in Nanshi the day before yesterday. She was lost, so he took her to the station. The station chief questioned her and learned that her name was Shi Lanying, 13 years old, a native of Ningbo. Her home is near the Ganqiaotou Tailai Pawnshop near Zhongshan Park in Ningbo. Her father's name is Shi Arong and he works as a plasterer. Two years ago, her father arranged for her to be betrothed to a shoe store in her hometown, where she was to be raised as a future daughter-in-law. However, because her in-laws were violent and often abused her, she was forced to come to Shanghai alone by boat, intending to find her uncle in Hongkou. Later, because she did not know the way, she got lost there. The station chief ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Please Thoroughly Investigate the False Accusation in the Bai Case <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Party Headquarters' Stance</p>
<p>Comrade Huang Jiahui, a probationary party member of the 18th Sub-division of the Third District Party Headquarters of this city and the General Secretary of the China National Anti-Drug Association, was ordered by the Anti-Drug Association to leave Shanghai with his wife, Ms. Bai Zhiying, on March 6th to investigate the situation of smoking prohibition in Taiwan. Unexpectedly, after leaving Shanghai, his wife, Ms. Bai Zhiying, was suddenly falsely accused of trafficking morphine and was caught by the Hong Kong Customs. This was reported in newspapers for a time, causing an uproar in public opinion. The headquarters immediately sent personnel to investigate and invited Mr. Huang and his wife to the meeting for talks. It was learned that Mr. Huang has been committed to the anti-drug movement for seven years, inevitably offending various parties. Moreover, he kept the trip to Taiwan for inspection somewhat secret in advance due to the awareness of the harsh environment. Unexpectedly, this rumor arose less than ten days after leaving Shanghai. It was found that Mr. Huang went to Taiwan on March 6th, taking the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship from Shanghai, arriving in Xiamen on the 9th, arriving in Taiwan on the 11th, and leaving Taiwan on the 19th. The dates of arrival and departure in Taiwan are stamped on the passport by the local Keelung Police Department as proof. Therefore, from March 6th to March 19th, Mr. Huang and his wife were indeed traveling between Shanghai and Taiwan, which proves that Mr. Huang and his wife did not go to Hong Kong, so how could there be any trafficking and being caught? The certificate of proof from the Hong Kong Customs Superintendent Laut is even more powerful evidence to the contrary. The association has now found ten pieces of evidence to the contrary, which were submitted by the fifth regular meeting for resolution and presented to the Municipal Executive Committee for submission to the Central Government to thoroughly investigate the person making the false accusation. It is said that this petition was sent out yesterday.</p>

<p>Wang Daoheng yesterday filed a complaint with the French Concession Court, stating that a businessman was recommended by a friend to the Ping'an Moving Company as an accountant. He paid a pawn deposit of 300 yuan, and the manager of the company, Gu Jianping, issued a receipt as proof. Unexpectedly, after working for more than a month, he was not paid any salary. When he asked for the pawn deposit, it was not returned. Therefore, he had no choice but to sue for interrogation and recovery. Gu Jianping confessed to receiving the pawn deposit, but only received 250 yuan at the time, including a returned check for 50 yuan, which was not returned because the plaintiff used it up. The plaintiff also claimed that the salary owed by the defendant had not been paid, so how could the businessman use empty accounts? He requested a clear investigation. Judge Gong ruled that the defendant should return 250 yuan to the plaintiff within fourteen days.</p>

<h3 id="e176">China Bank's Business Report for the 19th Year of the Republic of China (Continued) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Impact of Low Silver Prices</p>
<p>In the Bank's report for the 18th year, it was mentioned that the lowest silver price had fallen to 21 and 5/16 pence per ounce, which was said to be the lowest record in decades. However, in the 19th year, the lowest price actually fell to 14 and a half pence. This kind of drastic and significant change has a profound impact on national finance and the social economy, which is by no means insignificant. Now, let's briefly describe its advantages and disadvantages separately. First, let's talk about its harmful effects on our country, as follows: (1) Among the foreign debts that the Chinese government has to pay, those guaranteed by customs duties are exempt from pound losses because import duties are collected in full units, which are used to pay the principal and interest of foreign debts. If silver taels are still used for calculation, this loss will be more than 30 million taels of silver compared to the previous year. As for those guaranteed by salt taxes or railway income, their income is entirely calculated in silver dollars. When converted into foreign currencies, they still have to bear the loss on exchange rates. It is estimated that the principal and interest to be paid last year for salt tax guaranteed loans, such as the British and French Hukuang and Crisp loans, totaled approximately 700,000 pounds sterling. The principal and interest to be paid last year for railway guaranteed loans, such as Beining, Zhengtai, Jinghu, and Huhang, totaled approximately 370,000 pounds sterling. The two totaled more than 1 million pounds sterling. Calculated at last year's average exchange rate of approximately 18 yuan per pound sterling, the total amount to be paid was approximately 20 million yuan, which was 7 million yuan more than the previous year's average exchange rate of approximately 11 yuan per pound sterling. Other government expenditures, such as machinery, materials, military supplies, and medicines, also had to be ordered from foreign countries at high prices due to the rise in gold prices. These are all losses suffered by public finances. (2) Since gold prices have risen, goods calculated at the original price in gold will naturally rise accordingly. Purely foreign-made products are, of course, no exception. Even domestic products whose raw materials come from overseas have to raise their selling prices to compensate. For example, canned food, cosmetics, knitwear, medicines, etc., had all increased in price by 10% by the end of last year. On the public side, the salt tax was uniformly increased by 30 cents per dan, and the price of salt rose accordingly. Railway freight rates have also been increased one after another. For example, passenger fares on the Daqing and Jiaoji Railways increased by 20%, the Xiang'e Railway by 10%, and the Pinghan, Jinpu, Pingsui, and Longhai Railways all plan to increase passenger and freight rates by 15%. The Jinghu and Huhang Railways will increase by 20%, etc., all on the grounds of coping with the rise in gold prices. All of these necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation have increased in price to varying degrees. Therefore, the general cost of living index in Shanghai was 107.9 in the 18th year (with 1926 as the base year), and it rose to 121.4 in the 19th year. The drastic increase can be imagined, while the increase rate of the general public's income is not enough to match it. As a result, the difficulty of the people's livelihood is even greater than before. (3) Recently, the Chinese people have been advocating domestic products and industrial construction, which are about to be carried out. However, due to the high gold prices and the rise in machinery prices, investors have generally stopped. Other public and private construction projects have also had to change or shrink their planned plans as a result. The failure to quickly rectify the railways is also partly due to this. The benefits of the fall in silver prices to China are: (1) China's total export value last year was 894,843,594 customs taels, a decrease of 120,843,724 taels compared to the 18th year, or 11.9%. The decrease in exports is a universal phenomenon in the world. The United Kingdom decreased by 21%, the United States decreased by 26.7%, and Japan decreased by 31.6%. The decrease rate of our country's exports is far smaller than the above countries, which can be said to be a blessing in disguise. If silver prices had not fallen, the decrease might have been more than this number. (2) The development of Chinese domestic industries, such as wool textiles, cotton textiles, chemicals, cosmetics, enamelware, etc., Chinese factories have increased their output and sales have increased greatly. The development situation will be discussed in another chapter. This is the most profound relationship to the country's economic future. Although the fall in silver prices has equal advantages and disadvantages for China, it has more disadvantages than advantages for the world economy. As the world economy becomes increasingly internationalized today, we should pay attention to the interests of the whole world so that world trade can restore its normal state. Therefore, the silver price problem is still an important issue in the current world economy. According to the investigation, the world's silver production last year was 243,700,000 ounces, a decrease of 17,200,000 ounces compared to the previous year. Other supply amounted to 71,500,000 ounces, an increase of 6,400,000 ounces compared to the previous year. The total supply quantity was 315,200,000 ounces, an increase of 3,700,000 ounces compared to the previous year. In terms of consumption, China used a total of 123,000,000 ounces, India used 94,500,000 ounces, other countries used 28,100,000 ounces, and arts and crafts used 35,500,000 ounces. The remaining quantity was 34,100,000 ounces, an increase of 5,200,000 ounces compared to the previous year's surplus. This is the general situation of supply and demand. In the 19th year, China's import of raw silver was 102,550,947 customs taels, and the export was 35,554,029 customs taels. The net import was 67,005,918 customs taels. If the 30,551,948 taels transported to Hong Kong are not counted as exports, the total import would be 97,557,866 customs taels. The detailed figures of imports and exports are as follows:</p>
<p>Location 　Import (Customs Taels) 　Export (Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Europe 　3,148,526 　1,043,419</p>
<p>Americas 　40,729,073 　256</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Macau 　35,464,347 　30,391,481</p>
<p>Saigon and Tokyo 　18,838,277 　744,915</p>
<p>Singapore, etc. 　756,598</p>
<p>Java, etc. 　58,063</p>
<p>India, Burma, etc. 　1,728,069 　1,772,706</p>
<p>Japan, Korea, and Taiwan 　2,651,655 　645,259</p>
<p>Philippines 　141,332</p>

<p>The reason for the low silver price is not entirely due to India's sales. Although the Indian government sold 29,000,000 ounces last year, the import was 94,500,000 ounces, an increase of 20,000,000 ounces compared to the previous year. It is even less due to China's internal chaos, because China's import last year was 123,700,000 ounces, only a decrease of 13,700,000 ounces compared to the previous year. The main reason for the fall is still the general low price of goods in the world and the oversupply of silver itself. Therefore, unless the general market in the world gradually sees a turnaround or the supply of silver decreases, it is difficult for the silver price to have any hope of recovery. We dare not expect the silver price to return to its former state, but if the silver price continues to fluctuate indefinitely or even decline further, China's international trade will become increasingly depressed, and not only China will suffer. Various domestic construction plans will be difficult to carry out, and even the rectification of internal and external debts will be too burdensome to start. This has a significant relationship with all countries in the world. Therefore, the stability of the silver price is even more important than the increase in the silver price. In March of this year, the Bank's General Manager, in his personal capacity, suggested to the International Chamber of Commerce, saying that the silver price problem has reached an extremely serious area. Without the cooperation of all countries related to the silver price to study international cooperation methods, it is impossible to stabilize the silver price. It is proposed that the International Chamber of Commerce jointly propose to the International League to convene an international conference of all related countries as soon as possible to discuss this urgent issue. This proposal has been agreed by the International Chamber of Commerce and will hold a meeting in Washington in May of this year to decide to convene an international silver price conference this year. If silver producing countries and consumers cooperate with each other to help the implementation of the plan at that time, there may be a slight hope for the stability of the silver price.</p>

<h3 id="e177">An Overview of the Canadian Automobile Industry <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Song Yu</p>
<p>Windsor News. The Canadian automobile industry has shown signs of revival due to the revision of automobile import tariffs. Five years ago, the Canadian automobile industry could only maintain a meager existence. This was because automobile manufacturers operated by Americans found it cheaper to set up a factory in Canada than in the Americas. Now, due to tariff protection, those who used to transport automobiles for import will inevitably manufacture them locally in order to retain the Canadian automobile market.</p>
<p>The reason why the Canadian automobile industry has had such a turnaround is due to Prime Minister Bennett's cabinet order to revise the automobile tariffs. As a result, automobiles from the United States are now subject to a 20% dealer discount on the local retail price. If the number exceeds 20%, it cannot be imported. This means that all automobiles worth $1,200 or more are subject to a 27% tax, and those worth less than $1,200 are subject to a 20% tax, both of which are subject to 80% of the US selling price. In the past, dealers received discounts ranging from 27% to 40%. According to importers, a 20% discount is only enough to make a living. The automobiles they sell are always relatively more expensive than automobiles of the same value manufactured in Canada.</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the new tariffs, automobile importers spared no effort in criticizing the Prime Minister. However, American automobile manufacturers have spent a lot of time discussing with the authorities to set up automobile manufacturing sub-factories in Canada. In the shortest time, about six or seven factories will join the Canadian industrial world. All these factories will manufacture automobiles with a selling price of about $1,000.</p>
<p>At present, Liwa, Heibo Mapier, and Nash have made preparations to set up factories in Canada. Liwa and Nash factories are located in Toronto, and Heibo Mapier will open a factory in Windsor. Before the cabinet order was issued, the Canadian automobile industry was organized by 11 companies and 14 factories. These companies and factories engaged in the automobile industry specialize in building and assembling trucks, buses, and passenger cars. General Motors has factories in Wahah, Windsor, and Regina. Ford factories are located everywhere, with its headquarters in Windsor. Universal Motors, Gold Fraser, General Motors, Laiham, and National Trucks are all manufactured in eastern Canada. Durant and Huila Siwa Fulan are manufactured in Toronto. The automobile industry has shown signs of decline. The sales volume of various vehicles has fallen from 30% to 27% and 20%. The import tax on parts imported into Canada is still high, so Canadian factories are likely to close. This is because the manufacturing cost of new cars is still lower than that of imported cars. Later, the government was urged by all parties to change the tax rate. For an automobile, if 50% or more of the materials used in its manufacturing are manufactured in Canada, the import tariff on parts can be reduced by 25%. However, this method still cannot allow new factories to survive, because in fact, importing is still cheaper than manufacturing locally.</p>
<p>The current situation has changed drastically. The value of imported automobiles is incomparable to that of those made in Canada. However, automobiles with extremely high selling prices are not included in this case, because their market sales are limited, and it is still cheaper to import them from abroad. It is expected that 500 parts manufacturers in Canada will supply the needs of new companies to manufacture automobiles. Once this is opened, the number of workers needed locally will naturally increase. In addition to the fact that one automobile can be obtained for every eight people in Canada, automobile manufacturers in the future can also export new cars to foreign countries such as British territories. All those who have special treaties with Canada can benefit from it, which is greater than exporting directly from the United States.</p>
<p>Canada's own automobile export industry accounts for about one-third or 50% of its production. Canada ranks third in the world in automobile production, and it is also the third largest consumer of automobiles.</p>

<p>A. F. Sdgreaves, a famous Austrian automobile expert, said: Although the world's automobile production is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and cannot be counted, the British Austin should be the first choice. The quality of an automobile depends entirely on whether the internal machinery is perfect. Austin's machinery is solid and can be called unparalleled. Moreover, it saves gasoline and has a low selling price, which is quite suitable for the middle class to buy and drive. I have been driving Austin for four years. Even in strong winds and heavy rains, I must drive on rugged mountain roads. I have not repaired it for four years. If it were not for Austin's perfect machinery and solid body, it would not have been possible.</p>
<p>The Ford Model A is much better than the old Ford Model T. In terms of gasoline consumption, it can save an average of two-thirds. In terms of speed, it has also made great progress.</p>
<p>The American Automobile Monthly once published a newspaper soliciting readers to vote for which automobile is the best in their minds. As a result, there were more than 24,000 votes. The Chrysler car alone received 2,834 votes and won the first choice. The reason is that it is solid, durable, and beautiful in style. The number of votes received by each car is listed below to give a glimpse of the advantages and disadvantages of each car.</p>

<p>On the 18th of last month, a car speed race was held in Los Angeles, USA. The distance was 250 miles. All the visitors were well-known figures in the automobile industry. As a result, the Studebaker took one hour and one-fifth, the Chrysler took one hour and two-thirds, and the Ford Model A took one hour and one-third. The results were the best. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e179">Preparation for the Road and City Exhibition <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association has been established for ten years since its founding in the Republic of China. Therefore, the authorities of the association have organized a road and city exhibition to commemorate the tenth anniversary. It was originally scheduled to be held in April of this year. However, due to the time-consuming manufacturing, sending, and displaying of exhibits from remote provinces and foreign countries, the 16th Executive Committee meeting decided to postpone it and officially open it before August to September 12, so that all regions can prepare in a leisurely manner. The Road Exhibition can be opened with complete items to enhance the spectacle. The association has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order its subordinates to actively rush to manufacture the required exhibits. On the one hand, it also sent letters to the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Transportation, and Ministry of Industry to check. It also sent letters to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph to the embassies and consulates abroad to ask the road and city authorities and factories in each country to send personnel to participate and transport the exhibits to China to broaden their knowledge. The method of soliciting exhibits is to take exquisite pictures of 12 inches or more of the completed work and ongoing projects within the scope of road and city transportation. Such as newly built roads, bridges, and parks in historical sites, new buildings of all sizes, and new inventions for road construction, road maintenance, and transportation machinery, vehicles, oil tankers, etc., must be accompanied by detailed Chinese and Western instructions. Glue photos and models to the top of each vehicle and machine exhibit for the record or photography of Chinese and foreign representatives and Chinese and foreign people to take back to their respective countries and provinces and cities for display and permanent commemoration. On the one hand, the association will compile and print a special issue of the exhibition to promote it and provide a reference. Therefore, this year's Road and City Memorial Exhibition of the Road Association brings together the achievements of road and city transportation at home and abroad. It is an unprecedented international road and city exhibition. The work achievements, charts, and models will be designed and refined separately in the future and must be sent to the meeting one month before the opening for easy arrangement and decoration to enhance the spectacle and provide comparison. The domestic road and city exhibits outline planned by the association is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e180">The First Section of the Zhenju Road is Completed <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Wu</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang-Jurong Highway is the main line of the Beijing-Hangzhou line to the capital of Jiangsu Province. It is 40 kilometers long in total. The first section, from Zhenjiang to Huifeng Temple, is about seven kilometers long. It has been completed and opened to traffic on a trial basis. The road is built with the latest methods. The stone surface is about four meters wide, and the construction is quite solid. The project is divided into about six parts. (1) Open the roadbed. (2) Lay large stones. (3) Lay small stones. (4) Pour mud. (5) Lay small gravel. (6) Lay fine sand. The road surface engineering is so refined that it is inferior to the Zhongshan Road in the provincial capital. It can be used for five or six years without repair. Moreover, the turning points are built in imitation of the railway construction method, with one side raised high so that the passenger does not feel the turning. Even driving fast is not a problem. Trees are planted on both sides of the road, mostly French parasol trees. Huifeng Temple is located at the junction of Wuzhou Mountain and Shili Changshan. The road turns around in the mountain, and the car travels in it. The two peaks are lined with trees, and the foot of the two mountains is covered with lush pines and the water seeps through the streams. The scenery is better than Zhaoyin. The car speed can be 40 to 50 yards. It is now planned to build three thatched cottages behind Huifeng Temple for summer vacation and medical treatment. The area along the road will soon be prosperous. The sections from Huifeng Temple to Jurong are also being actively prepared and constructed. The completion date will not be far away.</p>

<p>Characteristics of Dodge's New Car: The Dodge Eight-Cylinder New Car is a successful masterpiece meticulously structured by the great engineering experts of the Dodge Motor Company, who gathered their minds and exhausted their thoughts. The novelty of the design, the thoroughness of the planning, the ingenuity of the construction, and the excellence of the materials used are all outstanding and appropriate. The entire body, from the front bumper to the taillights, is low, even, symmetrical, exquisite, and ingenious. At a glance, it is known to be the latest style in terms of car bodies. Coupled with beautiful lines and harmonious colors, it feels even more pleasing to the eye, attracting people. The new-style water tank head, automatic water tank cover, and naturally curved front fenders are extremely soft and beautiful. The low, long hood, nickel screen, and outwardly extending windshield with a permanently installed sight glass are also notable. Needless to say, the car body is made of a whole piece of steel, and all the major parts are integrated as if seamlessly woven. It is appropriate that it is strong, excellent, and extremely safe. As for spaciousness, steadiness, and quietness, it cannot be compared to ordinary vehicles. The front seats are easy to adjust, so they are suitable for all body types, allowing for extreme comfort. The interior of the sedan also has armrests and support straps. The ashtray is placed on the rear door. The clothes rack, corner lights, dome light, etc., are all complete. The dashboard and all decorative strips are constructed with high-grade wood and exquisite craftsmanship. The interior hardware is all nickel, and the exterior hardware is completely plated with nickel, making it incomparably shiny and dazzling. Various special superior cushions and matching colors are available for selection, each according to preference, all extremely appropriate. The wheelbase is lengthened to one hundred and eighteen inches. The newly invented dual-core low-grid frame reduces the overall height by four inches, and the ground clearance does not feel reduced. Being in the car allows for free movement and is extremely comfortable. The engine construction is particularly superior, and the mechanical power is exceptionally substantial. The piston displacement is two hundred forty and three hundred thirty cubic inches. The bore and stroke are three inches X four and one-quarter inches. At three thousand two hundred revolutions per minute, the power is eighty-four horsepower. The entire rubber insulation method is adopted, so there is no concern about shocks or tremors even when driving on rough roads. The famous internal expansion type wheel hydraulic brake is convenient to manage and has a great effect. Regardless of the speed of the car or the quality of the road, it is always easy to handle and control freely. All of these are the major features of the Dodge new car. If the rest of the small parts have undergone continuous improvements and are becoming more and more beautiful, it is enough to give buyers extreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>Chevrolet's New Car Arrives in Shanghai: Since the new 1931 Chevrolet car was launched last November, it has gained unprecedented acclaim in the American automotive industry. Now, its first batch of new cars to be shipped to China has arrived in Shanghai and will be displayed at the Jardine Matheson Building at 456 Avenue Foch from May 8 for a public exhibition.</p>
<p>According to Mr. He Zhenbo Xu, the owner of Jardine Matheson, this new 1931 Chevrolet set a new record in world car sales in December last year and January and February of this year. Its sales ratio accounts for 33.5% of all types of vehicles worldwide. Therefore, although the General Motors factory can manufacture 70,000 Chevrolets per month, the demand exceeds the supply, and the shortage is still significant. Even overseas distributors can only seek one or two vehicles for display purposes and cannot obtain them. Although General Motors has exhausted its efforts to rush production, it is still not enough to meet the domestic demand in the United States.</p>
<p>Speaking of the new Chevrolet car itself, it has the characteristics of various high-priced cars. The arc angles of the entire car and its lengthened 109-inch wheelbase are properly matched, making the appearance of the entire car more beautiful. The water tank has also been transformed, and the headlights are arranged in parallel on a specially made crossbar. All exposed metal parts of the front of the car are chrome-plated, making them dazzling and reflective.</p>
<p>The rear window of the new Chevrolet is specially widened, forming an extremely dignified appearance with its beautiful body. The front window is the famous Fei Xian VV type glass, which is clean and clear and has no concern about glare.</p>
<p>The dashboard inside the car has a speedometer, oil pressure gauge, temperature gauge, gasoline gauge, electric lock, carburetor choke, light switch, spark lever, and throttle knob, etc. The various instruments are appropriately arranged and illuminated with reflected light, making them even more obvious.</p>
<p>The new-style three-spoke steering wheel is constructed with precise calculations. It is made of pressed steel and protected by a rubber sleeve, so its movements are agile, strong, and reliable.</p>
<p>The padding inside the car body is made of beautiful woven fabrics, and the seats are suitable for the human body. In the special sedan, there are armrests, ribbons, and double smoking seats. The driver's seats of all sedans can be freely adjusted to fit the driver's height and habits.</p>
<p>Regarding the mechanical aspects of the new Chevrolet, in addition to the powerful engine, its manifold can sense heat extremely strongly, so its starting is sensitive. The cast iron of its cylinders is carefully sealed and cooled in a timely manner, and it can generate the strongest power at low speeds. This greatly increases the power for extending the life of the vehicle. The front end of the crankshaft is equipped with a special tuner. In addition, there are cleaners, shock absorbers, ventilators, and accelerator pumps, etc., with the latest automotive equipment. The forty-eight-pound heavy crankshaft and its large oil surface bearings are only seen in cars.</p>
<p>The steel teeth of the flywheel are smooth and clean and fit closely with the gears of the starting motor. In this way, countless starting difficulties can be avoided and the service life can be increased.</p>
<p>When it is in use, this new Chevrolet will surprise you with its unique advantages. Its smooth power, comfortable driving, agile acceleration, and free operation all demonstrate its soaring progress and have truly entered the ranks of the highest-grade cars.</p>
<p>With a speed of seventy miles per hour and the above features, it is a special contribution to the automotive industry in recent years. Do you still have any doubts?</p>
<p>One Thousand Mile Car Race: The car race held in Italy the other day had a course of one thousand miles. The number of participating vehicles was as many as one hundred, which stirred up the whole of Europe and was extremely grand. It is indeed worthy of being the first major sports event of the year related to international honor. At the same time, it is also one of the important long-distance races. As a result of the competition, Mr. Carlo Schell won the victory trophy amidst cheers. The car he was driving was a new 1931 sports car from the German Benz Motor Company. All the participants this time were the best of the time, and the vehicles they rode were all excellent and outstanding. It is appropriate that the competition was fierce, and the final victory was absolutely not accidental. It can be imagined.</p>
<p>The competition site is in the city of Brescia in Italy. It is planned to depart from this place, pass through Bologna and Florence, and arrive in Rome. Then from Rome to Ancona on the Adriatic River, then Bologna, then Verona, then Padua, and then turn back to the starting point, the city of Brescia. The total distance traveled reached 1,022 miles. Even a long-distance race is no more than this. What is even more noteworthy is that part of the route is rugged and bad, making it difficult to travel. Part of it is mountainous, winding and tortuous, making it difficult to drive fast. Some say that this kind of competition is truly no different from the most difficult and rigorous test of people and vehicles. If the driver is not proficient in driving, he will not be able to quickly and successfully complete the task. If the car he drives is not of superior quality and well-made, it is not enough to talk about the competition.</p>
<p>There were 103 vehicles participating in the competition, of all sizes and styles, produced in various countries. However, only Mr. Carlo Schell joined the competition from Germany to compete with Italian and other national players. And the final victory also belongs to Mr. Carlo. This has to be attributed to the high speed and absolute reliability of the SSK Benz car he drives. He finished the race in sixteen hours and ten minutes, always in the lead. The average speed was sixty-three miles per hour, which was much earlier than the second-place car, the Romeo car driven by the Italian player Campari. After the results were announced, not only the Germans were proud of it, but also all countries in Europe were surprised and envious and praised it.</p>

<p>Chrysler's Heavy Responsibility and Far-Reaching Achievements: The Chrysler Motor Company deserves to receive letters of praise from users of the car, saying that the car is durable, long-lasting, and far-reaching. There was a 1924 Chrysler sedan that has traveled 20,000 miles and can still be used on the road and still has the hope of winning a competition. There is another Chrysler car, which the owner bought in 1925, and its mileage has reached 183,000 miles.</p>
<p>Ms. Frey Wins the Championship: Mildred Frey, a girl from Milwaukee, won the world championship for endurance in car driving. Ms. Diefley defeated Ms. Naisher Lee's record in Indianapolis with a persistence of 120 hours. Frey was driving a Desa Tor six-cylinder car, which had 45 hours more endurance than Naisher Lee. The location for driving the car was Fei Xia Park in Milwaukee. It is said that Ms. Frey's car driving record is unmatched by any woman in the world.</p>
<p>Brazil Builds National Roads: The Brazilian government is now planning to build car roads that pass through the whole country. A committee on this plan has now been established to consider this construction so that it can be implemented. According to the original plan, the new roads will connect the roads of various states to each other.</p>
<p>One-Tenth Engaged in the Automotive Industry: The British automotive industry is well-developed in the world. According to the California Automobile Association, in the United States of America, one out of ten people must be engaged in the automotive industry. However, their work is initially not fixed. It may be manufacturing, sales, investment, or service, only the difference between direct and indirect.</p>
<p>Loudspeaker Used on Cars: In the British automotive industry, there is a new invention of car equipment, which is a loudspeaker. This loudspeaker is installed next to the steering wheel. When driving, the driver can issue a loud warning signal to alert pedestrians far away, or he can expand the opinions in the driver's mind and tell the police to ensure the safety of the car.</p>

<p>The Qitian Stage declares that since this stage caters to social psychology and has produced a great stage design and interspersed with the novel and special Fan Lihua moving mountains and overturning seas, it has been packed day and night, even so crowded that it is impenetrable. Before the opening, customers gather like a tide, which is a phenomenon rarely seen in the Shanghai theatrical world in recent years. As for the play's composition, it is novel and different from the others, the plot is compact, and there is not a single dull scene. There are as many as seven or eight song and dance scenes, each extremely wonderful, interspersed and changed every day and night, without any repetition. Let's describe the outline of a few great scenes. The first scene is the military march in the mountains, which is mighty and magnificent. The three armies sing military songs, which resonate throughout the sky. The Xue family generals, in glorious military attire, with flags covering the sky, are all specially made. Even if the old novels describe them in detail, they still cannot describe one ten-thousandth of their appearance. Secondly, there is the Lishan Blessed Land, with jade-lettered towers, strange flowers and exotic plants, covering the cliffs. The immortals float in the blue waves, playing the Neon Clothes Song between the Orchid Pavilions. Fan Lihua, with her cloud-like hair, slowly descends from the auspicious clouds, dancing her most satisfying swordsmanship, named Haiyan Heqing. It was taught by a famous swordsman when Ms. Lu performed in Guangdong. Every rise and fall, every advance and retreat, has a solution, which is different from the ordinary. Moreover, it has been praised by internal experts many times. The Lishan Old Mother enlightens the future in the midst of green pines and cypresses, revealing the secrets of heaven, making people want to escape from the dust and forget the mundane. The third is moving mountains. Thousands of valleys and cliffs fly in the air. The lush and verdant boulders instantly surround Ding Shan like an iron bucket. The woodcutter on the top of the mountain lets down a rope to save him. Ding Shan climbs up the rope, but unexpectedly, the old woodcutter actually pulls out his short ladder, putting a brave general in a situation where he cannot go to heaven or earth. Mischievous squirrels even come to tease him. Do you think it is dangerous or not? Let's talk about the scene of overturning the sea. Thousands of acres of waves stand upright. The fish, turtles, snails, and clams at the bottom of the sea cannot settle down and dance and beg for mercy on the beach. Ding Shan floats and sinks on the sea surface, really wanting the audience to be anxious. The Xue Fan bridal chamber is the most beautiful plot in the whole play. The scene is graceful and luxurious, even more so than the palace. A good marriage turns into a bad marriage. Lihua is ambushed and goes to Lishan, knocking on the old mother to ask for the future result. This scene has wonderful changes and is extremely mysterious. The last scene is the evil spirits in Qinglong Pass. Ding Shan is surrounded in the fiery flames. Real fire fills the stage, and red dragons fly around, rushing straight towards Ding Shan. At this point, the audience wants to sweat for Ding Shan. Although the general is proud and brave, he has to call Lihua to save his life. The whole play then comes to an end. It can be said that it is the first-class work in this play, and so on.</p>
