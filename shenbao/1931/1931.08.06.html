<p>路透五日紐約電　今日此間盛傳墨京發生嚴重之經濟風潮、並有數銀行停止付現之謠言、據最近消息、此項警訊、實無根據、蓋由一西班牙銀行暫停營業兩星期而起、該銀行整理内務後、仍將十足付欵、墨西哥國民銀行昨日曾有擠兌、但至下午、提欵者即漸見稀少、故行員現信擠兌已息、該銀行與墨西哥國家銀行並無關係、</p>

<p>— 徐守堅</p>
<p>以籃球著名之上海兩江女體專校。創辦以來已有多載。聲聞遐邇。本屆畢業生因感平日學業之不足。特設暑期班於吳淞水産學校、月之一日該班童軍露宿於寳山南門外公共體育塲　茲將經過瑣聞拉雜書此。</p>
<p>赤脚大仙滿街跑　寳山地處海隅。雖近滬埠。人情風俗尙稱閉塞。一日下午。寳城窮鄉僻道中。頓發現玉腿赤裸之女土。三五成羣。往來嬉遊。一時觀者咸驚訝不止。羣謂「何來這般不怕羞之赤脚大仙」也。</p>
<p>西瓜汽水生意忙　邇來天氣酷熱。赤日當空。諸女童軍營幕始張。即覺香汗淋漓。呼熱不止。一般汽水冷食小販。生意頓形興隆。體育塲茶役某。本爲附近農人。乃挑西瓜數担呌買。未幾銷售一空。囊間累累。不禁笑口常開矣</p>
<p>凉風習習開野會　晚間八時。舉行露宿野會、寳册城内居民扶老携幼。傾城往觀警笛一聲。全體列隊作圓形。中燃稻草。在火光熒熒中由敎練冷雪樵君作簡單之報告略謂鄙校得與貴地人士一聚。曷勝榮幸。惟事前無充分之預備。故今日野會中所表演之節目。非常簡陋。有負諸位來賓之厚望。尙祈鑒原是幸今日出席諸君。均係兩江本屆畢業生。分離在即深望諸同學一展生平之絶技。以點綴此難逢之盛會云云、乃推劉女士任主席。全體牽手圍繞一周。且舞且歌。唱中國童子軍歌一首。歌聲嘹亮。嚮透雲霄。頗表示激昻慷慨之精神。繼乃表演遊藝。節目中有扇子舞優秀舞等數種。舞姿蹁躚。身段婀娜。博得掌聲不少。某女士之却爾斯頓舞。粗腰邁步。忸怩作態。雙足擺動。頗堪發噱。最後全體合唱兩江校歌。盡興而散。時已十句鐘矣。</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>在最近的幾年來。常見報載飛機遭禍的慘事世界上的科學雖然一天比一天的在進步。可是就目前而論空中飛行還是一件並不十分安全的事。</p>
<p>飛機在天空中所遇的危險。大半是由於天時之驟變或機件之損毁。然而除此以外。就歷來飛行界的記錄以觀。則更有若干意想不到的危險。說出來似乎有趣得緊。因名余篇曰天空中中的趣事。</p>
<p>例如。本年四月初旬。有一艘長途飛行機。從法國馬賽飛往巴黎機中載有若干旅客及少許行李。行李中有某人帶的幾箱蜜蜂。到了半途不知爲什麽。有一箱中的蜂　羣忽然突圍而出。飛集在旅客及駕機者的身畔。實施其侵略的工作。試想小小的一座飛行機中。本來已無多大的廻旋之地。現在又有了這許多擾人的小醜。防不勝防。避無可避。豈不要呌苦連天。而尤苦者還是那駕機員。他要留心機件顧到旅客們的安全。兩只手豈能隨意移動。只得任憑那蜜蜂　們自由螫嚙。到了目的地。方脫苦難可是全身已無一塊完好的皮膚哩。</p>
<p>還有一次。尙在歐戰的時候。有一艘英國飛機。越過英國海峽。飛赴歐陸。機上只有一個客人。到了半途。忽然發起瘋來。拿了一把手槍。對準了駕機員。要求他一同跳下機去。駕機員看看飛機所過。尙是茫茫的大海眉頭一皺。計上心來。就很客氣地對他說道：「先生·請你先下去，我跟着就來。」那瘋子就上了當。駕機員方保住了性命。</p>
<p>更有一次。有一艘商業飛機。行至中途。忽然發見有一處重要機件。出了毛病。駕機員爲旅客安全計就降機落地。細加查騐。方知那機件的左近。有幾頭老鼠在做窠。當即把它們趕走。修理了一下方罷</p>
<p>還有在非洲某處。有一探險家坐了飛機。很低的沿着平地攷察。忽然有一頭獅子。撲將過來。竟把那機上的翼子損毁。還有英國的喬治王子。最近在印度游歷。駕機代步。常有老鷹們在天空中飛撲過來。損毁了機件。而美國某處。更有一名飛行家。因老鷹撲機。竟而墜下身死。這種意想不到的危險。又怎樣的可以防禦周全呢。</p>

<p>有程濟桃君臣石之遺蹟</p>
<p>明初靖難之役。野乘載建文帝薙度爲僧。由隧道出亡。莫知所終。世遂以帝爲遜國。而舊明　史力辨其妄。謂建文闔宫自焚。身殉社稷。顧父老相傳。建文曾卓錫杭縣北鄉大遮山之東明寺。遺蹟猶存。歷歷可考。是又以野乘所載爲可信也。茲將建文卓錫大遮山之事略及遺蹟。誌之如左。以供研究明史者之稽考。</p>
<p>大遮山界於杭縣德清武康之交。在杭垣虎林門外五十里。高揷雲表、周圍三十餘里。登其巓。南望淛江。則一衣伖水中。檣帆隠約可辨。北瞰武康。則莫干山之屋宇。歷歷可數。於此想見該山之高矣。山上竹木暢茂。景色清幽。山之巓。有道觀一。額曰清眞院。羽土居之。距院三里許之山腰。又有一佛殿。曰東明寺。爲僧侣參禪之所。按寺與院。俱建於元至元中。</p>
<p>明初靖難之役。相傳建文帝披剃爲僧。廷臣程濟束髮作道家裝。相與出亡。由禁宫隧道而出。潛趨浙西獨松關。（在餘杭縣西北七十五里。爲江浙二省要溢。）復由獨松關至杭縣北鄉之大遮山遂隠焉。惟二人各居一處。建文桂錫東明寺。程濟燒丹清眞院。從此君臣二人。各度方外生活清眞院與東明寺之距離。上下成一直綫。彼此遙望。隠約可見。建文程濟自隠於此後。每日黎明。二人輒出山門外。作一度互相遙望而院與寺之間。有一丈方巨石。光潔瑩潤。每遇朔望。君臣二人。輙會於石上。此石迄今猶存。咸呼之曰君臣石今該山又有所謂程濟桃者。果不甚大。伏時成熟。熟時。核與肉離。近核處。肉色殷紅○味頗鮮美。爲該山之特産。相傳此桃係當年程濟所種。其種遞嬗而降。以迄於今。故稱之曰程濟桃云。</p>
<p>今清眞院側殿中。供有程濟偶像。作純陽裝。而東明寺後殿之另一室中。塑有一僧像。年約三十許身披袈裟。手執佛珠。低眉跌坐。聞此像即當年位尊九五之明代建文帝也。按大遮山距吾鎭僅十二里。每年八月十三日。爲該山清眞院神誕之期。頗爲熱閙。予曾兩度往游。上述之遺蹟。爲予所目賭云。</p>

<p>六號同司克大十Ｓ·Ｒ·Ｄ　　博士夫婦參與印度大學之學生游藝會。會在大廳。人衆千餘。男女生均在座。電扇已開。客至則招待員用盤獻鮮花及松枝各一枚。不久。又以香水噴筒噴座客。此較之日間各人用彩色水相洒者。爲進化矣。香水噴筒。噴頭上不過數點。若彩色水大潑全身爲惡作劇也。已而游藝會開始。男女童奏樂唱歌。有一力士舉鐵環。云十百十五磅。又以鐵葉裏於手而捲之。如捲繩。捲後以示座客。余視之。鐵葉可厚四分。寬一寸餘。其所捲之鐵葉。無人能伸開者。可謂勇矣。但其人身體並不大。平常耳。蓋練習而成也。余因路遠未終劇而先歸。同司克大士夫婦至其家。於時皓月東升花樹搖影。乃爲夜談。司克博士夫婦均久於英倫之名醫也。自有花園。因論社會醫學及衛生之事。印度敎士普通皆素。食無食肉者。以肉爲不潔也。據云彼願用醫學衛生法案以建設一新村。村内田宅園牧一切生活作工之分配。凡生育長養疾病以至老死喪葬之法。皆應以衛生規則制定之。財産器械牲畜房産。可以公有者公有之。可以私有者私有之。全村不論多少人家。一律歸醫生指導處理之。彼云。人未生以前母權重。旣下生以後。應重醫權。處置財産風俗等事。應從衛生學爲標準。如資本家之奴隸工人。大背衛生規則。余問曰。若有戰爭殺人盈野。豈非更背衛生之道。將奈之何。答曰。應用醫權聨合世界醫家。以廢除戰禍。與母權並重。母以生之。醫以保之。則天下可平也。余曰。此理甚善。按吾華古代始創國家者。爲兩醫生。曰神農黃帝。今開創民國者。又一醫生。爲孫中山。惟醫生深知衛生保民之事。是以中華醫生而兼爲君師。由君之計劃必以醫士。小則兼任新村村長。大則兼任一國元首。斯可矣。此亦醫化大同學也。願天下醫家聨合而爲此運動其夫人名古姆利。甚熱心社會運動。</p>

<p>丁小姐吩咐秋子說：「我現在要出去一回，讓老太太吃了夜飯先去睡，不要再等候我了。」秋子唯唯地答應着。</p>
<p>秋子給他們先開了們，陸先生和丁小姐就一同走了出去，一個走在前，一個在後·直到走出了大門以後，秋子又瞧見在前走的是停了下來，在後走的是追了上去，接着就並肩地走了。</p>
<p>「到什麽地方去？」陸先生問。</p>
<p>「我很想去玩一會高爾夫球。大華球塲不是很近嗎？我們就到大華去吧！」丁小姐說。</p>
<p>陸先生對於高爾夫球却是　個生手，丁小姐雖然玩過幾回，但也不很熟練。所以他們倆打得很慢，而且擊數也很多：當打到第八個穴的時候，丁先生居高臨下，突然地瞧見那邊立着　個人，正是方才到伊家裏來過的李先生，抬頭向伊望着。</p>
<p>伊的確有些窘迫了，雖然伊是不願意見他，但是見着面總覺得不能不招呼一下：何况方才他到過伊家裏來的呢？</p>
<p>伊正在躊躇的時候，李先生却走上來了。</p>
<p>「丁小姐！怎麽你也會來？方才我到過你府上，你們的使女說你已經出去了。想不到居然在此地會遇見的！」李先生回過頭來，故意做着方才看見陸先生的神情，又接着說：「啊！小陸！好極！是你同來的麽？」</p>
<p>陸先生心裏祗厭惡看他。却帶着傲慢的神情淡淡地回答道：「我特地去邀着丁小姐一同來的·」</p>

<h3 id="c137">五金　全市無新發展 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>市塲槪况昨日五金市况、緣各帮無甚進胃、是以全市趨勢亦無新發展貨價則有幾種因供不敷求、頗有靑雲直上之勢、而尙有數種花色、則亦因供過於銷、致有江河日下之象、茲分述主要者於下、</p>
<p>六十磅馬口鐵現貨大缺　六十磅馬口鐵、係一種匣子廠之切需品、近則市貨大缺、而各帮辦進之手叚、依然在進行之中、因是人心猛秀、標準飛騰、價格每箱竟要至五十兩、比前暴跳六兩半、觀近日之環境、恐行情一節、尙須再趨漲風也、</p>
<p>法西釘已成萎靡之局面　法西釘自東貨不能來申後、本埠市面、本有進展之勢、無奈客帮銷路、或受兵災匪禍之影響、或遭洪水閙共之打擊、以致去胃大遜、雖各同業竭力推銷、仍難挽救於萬一、况本廠釘出貨甚廣、因是全市不得不陷於萎靡之地步、雖目下開價祇要八兩七錢半、然尙無受主云、</p>

<p>今晨晋就面謁外王</p>
<p>鮮案責任全在日本</p>
<p>共同調查尙無所聞</p>
<p>駐日公使汪榮寳、昨日下午五時許、由津乘太古公司通州輪抵滬、偕來者有隨員任家豐、因途中勞頓、昨晚在滬休息一宵、定今晨乘特快車晉京、向外部報告鮮人仇華慘案眞相、洽商應付辦法、决定交涉方針、本報記者、昨在旅次訪晤汪氏、據談、此次余奉外部訓令、赴平壤·仁川·京城·等處、調查鮮案眞相、調查結果、已作有整個的書面報告、面呈外部、作爲交涉根據、至余私人之意見、及鮮案調查略况、已詳余迭次在遼平津對新聞界發表之談話中、茲不贅述、要之、此次鮮案、係全鮮各地仇華同時暴動、平壤損失最重、全部物質損失、槪數爲二百四十三萬日金、約合華幣五百萬元、全鮮均在日人勢力下、日方事前旣不制止、事後又不保護、責任無論如何不能推諉、外傳中日共同調查、尙無所聞、余在平曾謁見張副司令、報告一切、一日離津、乘通州輪南下、在舟中凡五日、天熱、汗出如漿、旅途極不舒適、今晚（昨晚）在此休息一宵、定明晨（即今晨）晉京、面謁王外長、詳爲報告、至余留京日期、及返任與否、完全聽命於中央、余在朝鮮時、鮮人智識階級、多來請謁、對鮮案表示非出鮮人本意、應請原諒、並表示極度歉意、至日方當局、亦一再聲明、保證不再發生此項事件、余當答稱、此非余私人問題、實我民族全體問題云云、</p>

<p>外報言之有物</p>
<p>各界斥爲揑造</p>
<p>當局認爲謠傳</p>
<p>滬西無知商人、妄請推廣租界一事、本報已將大美晚報所載者、轉載昨報、原以喚起全滬人士注意、乃大美晚報、昨又載工部局復該商人函、猶不自認爲揑造、記者深望滬西商人應即自動聲明、市商會應速派員查明眞相、市政當局更須積極市政建設、而外交當局尤應努力於租界之收回、則此種謠傳、自當不闢自絶也、茲將昨日所得種種消息、探誌如下、</p>

<p>上月分本埠各外輪之領港人員、因要求增費、實行罷工、歷經一星期之久、後由江海關港務局長之調停、先行復工、限兩禮拜中、由各輪公司議定增費與否、再行答復領港公會、此事迭誌本報、扣至本月四日、兩星期限期屆滿、關於增費間題、經記者赴各方面切實探問、茲將所聞情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>暫不漲費　自七月二十二日、各領港復工後、滬上各外輪、對於此事、曾邀集同業、會議多次、結果均以仍照舊章不主張加費者居多、各輪公司、以所負領港費用、已甚巨大、近來海運營業、正值衰落之秋、故議定對於該問題、取冷靜態度、以後船舶進出、仍照舊章、各輪公司對領港公會不予答復、使经事無形擱置、故邇日並無表示也、</p>
<p>縮短領線　各外輪在港務長調解之後、均發電致各本行報告經過、並請示對於加費辦法、在此兩星期中、各輪公司爲此事往返經商、已非一次、聞各船東於增加領港費亦一致反對、並爲先事預防計、各輪公司、業與航行遠東之各船船長商定、萬一領港人員必欲漲費、則輪公司方面、亦可容納、惟漲費時、須提出條件、將領港線縮短、向來外洋輪來滬、到銅砂即須引水、先至吳淞、再帶進浦江、出口亦然、海路甚長、須納兩次費用、今則改爲銅砂至吳淞一段、由各船自行、（此一段船主大副均熟悉、）直抵吳淞口、再用領港帶進、如此、則可减去領港海程五分之四、而各輪僅須納付一小段之引水費、即使照該公會之要求、而完全承認、在事實上轉可以减省費用五分之三、茲悉各外輪已擬定即照此主張、苟領港必欲漲費者、實行縮短領線、如領港將加費事擱置者、則仍維原狀、暫不變更云、</p>

<p>(Jinan) A person from De County stated that routed soldiers from Shi's army arrived in the territory on the evening of the 4th. Army Commander Cao Fulin arrived that night to handle the reorganization. A pontoon bridge is currently being built across the Yunhe River west of the county. It is possible that a large number will continue to arrive tonight. The local area is safe. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Deputy Zhang telegraphed Jiang Bocheng, Ge Guangting, and Fan Pujiang today, reporting on the pursuit.

They are now assembled in Quyang, and special commissioners have been dispatched to receive them. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Deputy Zhang, representing Fan Pujiang, visited Chairman Han yesterday, stating that the Deputy Commander-in-Chief was extremely distressed about the campaign against Shi, because Shi surrendered and he was one of the mediators. Unfortunately, Shi ultimately changed his mind and was the first to break with the Northeast. The overall situation in the Northeast cannot be maintained by him alone. He still requests that all parties share responsibility. Han expressed that, except for fighting Shi, he will obey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief in everything. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) This afternoon, Sun Tongxuan and Zhao Xinde came to Jinan from Zhoucun. Sun stated that he telegraphed today to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army Corps. (5th Dispatch)</p>

Yu plans to go to the Jinpu Railway line to pursue them. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Nengyi, advisor to the headquarters, told reporters that the military situation on the Pinghan Railway is generally over. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief originally planned to return to Shenyang to handle military and political affairs after the Shi unit issue was resolved. However, because the reorganization of Shi's remnants has not been completely resolved, he is temporarily staying in Beiping to preside over affairs. Shi's unit is mostly composed of bandits. Although the military operations against Shi are over, the bandits still need to be suppressed. Zhang Xuecheng's unit has become bandits. The reorganization of the others is pending discussion. Currently, approximately one division of Shi's troops has entered Shandong. Commander-in-Chief Jiang telegraphed Han Fuju not to reorganize them. Therefore, it is uncertain whether he can be responsible for the reorganization. The Beiping curfew issue will be decided after Yu Xuezhong returns to Beiping. Gao Guizi's unit, Gao Jianbai's Brigade, has crossed Zhaocheng. Cases involving Beiping Communist bandits and military criminals are all handled by the curfew headquarters. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Shi Yousan was defeated on the Pinghan Railway, he collapsed and retreated towards Wuji and Shenze. Because Yu Xuezhong's unit pursued him, he collapsed and fled towards Shulu and Zaoqiang. Part of his force fled towards Linqing and Guantao in Shandong Province. Yu's unit continued to track him. Wang Shuchang's unit also set up roadblocks in Wuqiang, while Han Fuju and Ma Hongkui, among others, were setting up strict defenses in Gucheng and Wucheng, etc. Shi's unit is trapped in a four-sided encirclement and has no way to escape other than surrendering.

<p>(Nanjing) Rong Zhen telegraphed Gao Weiyue on the 3rd, stating that Shi's rebels mutinied and arrived in Dingzhou on the 28th of last month, launching fierce attacks on Wangdu to Zhangdengzhen. My brigades of Li Zhentang, Chen Guanqun, Dong Yingbin, Du Jiwu, and Bai Fengxiang fought fiercely all day. Then, 20,000 enemy troops attempted to break through the Chen Brigade's position at Zhangdengzhen and Lilai Village. The Chen Brigade fought hard to resist, but the enemy occupied Xiaoli Village and lost battalion commanders and officers. Dong Brigade reinforced and retook the lost ground.

<h3 id="e16">(4) The Disaster Situation in the Yangtze River Basin <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu is bisected by the large east-west Huai River and the north-south Grand Canal. Furthermore, the large lakes such as Hongze, Taihu, Baoying, Da Zong, and Weishan hold a great deal of water. The low-lying areas along the lakes are already plagued by floods during normal times. This time, continuous torrential rain and mountain torrents have erupted and spread everywhere. Furthermore, the upstream floods of the Yangtze River and the Huai River have surged downwards, as if from the sky, vast and unstoppable. The dikes and embankments in various places have been breached in many places. As a result, more than 30 counties along the water, such as Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Liuhe, Yixing, Jiangyin, Wujin, Suzhou, Wuxi, Huai'an, Huaiyin, Yizheng, Baoshan, Shanghai, Linhuai, Gaozi, Kunshan, Nantong, Haimen, etc., have all suffered惨劫. The fields and houses have all been submerged. The losses of beans, wheat, and cotton are enormous. Furthermore, the disaster situation in the vicinity of Nanjing is also惨. More than 120,000 mu of farmland have been庭园栖鱼by the floodwaters. The cries can be heard to the heavens. The total number of victims is already around 50,000. As for the Nanjing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways, the tracks have also been damaged in many places. Traffic is blocked. The losses are uncountable. This is the disaster situation in Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The disaster areas in Zhejiang, such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Wuxing, Changxing, Yuhang, Changhua, Lin'an, Chongde, Deqing, Fuyang, Pinghu, Huzhou, Shaoxing, etc., have all destroyed crops and houses, and the people have become鱼鳖. In particular, Fuyang County has suffered the大水之中added冰雹. The raging and throwing勢同彈擊had pieces weighing up to sixteen jin. With the flood below and the猛彈above, the慘of the disaster is unprecedented in decades.</p>
<p>In summary, the above only refers to a local part of the Yangtze River basin. There are at least 300 counties affected by the disaster, with at least 15 million victims. The number of deaths and the loss of property will be even greater when the investigation is completed and the statistics are counted. Furthermore, Tianchuan, in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, is located in a relatively remote area. The newspapers have少记载the disaster situation there. In short, the province has many mountains and little land. Once a mountain flood occurs, it has no way to be released. Its受灾之惨 should be no less than other provinces. Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu are important areas. Normally, the people in our country depend on these provinces for most of their food. Now, the grain and wheat have gone with the flood. The autumn harvest is hopeless. The country's food situation has suddenly entered a绝境. Food prices are already soaring. The future is long. How will the 400 million people survive? What is even worse is that the waves carry sand and turn stones, washing away the fields and turning them into wasteland. In the future, there will be less arable land and reduced agricultural production. What will happen to food? Across the north and south of the Yangtze River, there is sorrow everywhere. The people are嗷嗷待救, and in the midst of the悲惨cries, there is an even greater危机伏. We cannot and must not turn a blind eye and deaf ear to this pressing and serious problem without providing assistance.</p>

<p>(Hankow) The water level in Wuhan still shows no rise or fall. Many floating corpses in Hankow. One family of eight, tied together with rope, was a tragic sight to behold. Refugee camps have been expanded to eight. The relief section of the Emergency Relief Association decided to add twenty staff members, recommending Huang Wenzhi as the Director-General. The dykes at Huangjintang, Pizi Street, and the Pacific Soap Factory are being raised and thickened. He Baohua is supervising the emergency repairs at Qiaokou. In Wuchang, the city is flooded. Both the Saihu Embankment and Xujiapeng are in imminent danger. Xu Yuanquan and Xia Douyin are personally supervising the work. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankow) The Garrison Headquarters ordered its subordinates to investigate and arrest traitors and prevent riots, and stipulated four measures. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankow) The floodwaters in Hankow city rose another six inches to one foot last night. There is currently no hope of the water receding. The Chinese authorities have decided to erect a straight pontoon bridge in the commercially prosperous area. Cars in the city are submerged and cannot operate, with small boats being the only means of transportation. Although the Water and Electricity Company and the Electricity Bureau continue to provide electricity, the authorities have issued a notice asking residents to prepare candles and foreign candles in case of emergency. Because in this dangerous situation, when the power will be cut off is unknown. If the power goes out, the city will turn into a dark world, and people's hearts will be even more disturbed. Goods in various shops in the city have been flooded. Except for Nisshin Shipping Company, the warehouses of various shipping companies and general warehouses have been flooded, causing huge losses, beyond expectations. (5th Special Dispatch from the News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankow) Due to the overflow of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, the suburbs of Hankow and the surrounding areas are all a vast expanse of water, with not a single piece of dry land. Vast fields of crops, homes, and trees are all submerged in the water, a truly tragic sight. It will take at least several years to restore the situation before the flood. The time when the water will recede cannot be predicted at present. What is most feared after the flood is the outbreak of epidemics and the arrival of great famine. Just thinking about this makes one tremble with cold. At present, the most urgent problem is that 150,000 to 160,000 flood victims are on the verge of starvation. If they act recklessly, it is extremely worrying. The number of deaths per day is always more than dozens. There is no way to bury their bodies. Most of them are washed away by the water. Some of them have already rotted. The scene is so tragic that it is heart-wrenching. The Japanese authorities, who never allow earth or water burials, are applying preservatives to the dead Japanese residents and sending them to the Honganji Betsuin to await the restoration of the crematorium.

He visited Foreign Minister Shidehara again on the 3rd, but still failed to obtain key points. He has recently decided to return home. Chen's mission was to negotiate with the military to purchase weapons and recruit Japanese officers, and to negotiate with industrialists to borrow money. Although the military did not explicitly refuse on the surface, it was only lip service. As for the loan negotiation, because the Guangdong government's foundation is not solid, no one recognizes it.

<p>Financial Crisis Safely Overcome</p>
<p>Iron-Willed Prime Minister Encourages the Nation:</p>
<p>Many Thorns and Briers Ahead</p>
<p>Self-Help is Better Than Help from Others</p>
<p>Central Foreign Exchange Bank Established</p>
<p>National Telegram, Berlin, 4th: All German banks will resume normal operations tomorrow. Prime Minister Brüning will deliver a speech tonight on the origins of the financial panic and the government's rescue plan based on self-help, broadcast nationwide by radio and relayed to the United States, in order to encourage the people to overcome difficulties with courage. He stated that a recent analysis of the origins of the current panic in Germany reveals that it stems from the payment of reparations and debts, and the resulting unequal distribution of gold. Germany has always lacked sufficient money to pay reparations, and will never have sufficient money in the future to pay them. Therefore, we had to resort to borrowing. Long-term borrowing was not available, so we used short-term borrowing as an emergency measure, which eventually created a financial organization that was like glue. It would collapse at the first sign of trouble. However, an important element has emerged from this crisis: the world has realized that one country's loss cannot be another country's gain. If a great economic entity like Germany is in serious trouble, other countries will not be immune to the effects. The Paris and London conferences, where representatives from seven countries sat at the same table, analyzed the situation and agreed on resolutions for common welfare, were good omens that boosted courage during the panic. It is believed that the various meetings in the past few weeks are only the prelude to a systematic international effort in the future. French government leaders will soon arrive, and Mr. Briand may also come, so that we can continue to work for the reconciliation of the two nations. Thinking of this is gratifying. However, today, Germany's desire to raise huge international loans is no longer an issue due to financial and political reasons. Therefore, we must rely on our own financial resources. This is the basic policy of the government at present. As for the request from certain quarters to completely isolate Germany from the world market, this theory is not worth discussing, because in economic terms, Germany and other countries are interdependent. In this era of extremely complex international financial and economic relations, it is impossible to close ourselves off. Later, when discussing the government's emergency plan, he said that although the people are feeling great difficulties, this is not the time to comment on the various emergency orders. The government is not without its faults, but in any case, it will do its best without fear or favor, and will do what it considers best without regard to the interests of one side. We have been able to restore the balance of domestic finances. The banks will reopen tomorrow. Although there may still be days of emergency in the next few weeks, I am convinced that the most dangerous period is over. However, it will take years to clear the rubble and get the country out of trouble.</p>
<p>National Telegram, Berlin, 5th: After three weeks of financial straits, Germany has at least returned to normal on the surface today. After the banks opened at 9:00 AM, the emergency orders restricting payments were lifted. All depositors were free to withdraw money, but there was no bank run. The number of people going to withdraw money was not large. According to news from major banks, until noon, the amount of money received was more than the amount paid out.</p>
<p>National Telegram, Berlin, 4th: The Central Foreign Exchange Bank, newly formed under an emergency order, opened today. The office is located in the Inland Revenue Bureau. All foreign currencies entering and leaving the country must go through the bank. Importers and exporters are not allowed to hoard foreign currencies themselves, which makes them feel very difficult. Hamburg and other seaports were hit hard. Today, the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Minister of Finance, proposing to assign management commissioners to be stationed in major commercial banks to facilitate foreign exchange transactions.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, London, 4th: The Bank for International Settlements has decided to hold the first meeting of the committee next Saturday and Sunday. This committee was formed at the request of the seven-nation conference in London. Its task is to investigate Germany's current debt needs and study the possibility of converting part of the short-term debt into long-term debt. At the same time, the bank's administrative department has approved the extension of the 20 million pound loan borrowed by the German National Bank, which is due on Thursday, for three months. Mr. Wiggin, the US representative attending the above-mentioned committee, is currently on his way to Europe by ship and will arrive on Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e49">London Exchange Rate Plummets <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Caused by the French Buying US Dollars Instead</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, London, 5th: This morning, when the stock exchange opened, the pound price fell sharply, and the prices of various securities also fell. The New York exchange rate fell from 4.8575 to 4.8437, and the Paris exchange rate fell from 123.90 to 123.50, but it is still falling. It is rumored that the fall is due to the Bank of France suddenly stopping buying pounds and buying US dollars instead. However, in any case, the sale of pounds seems to have originated in Paris. According to a telegram from New York, the market situation in London today is very strange.</p>

<p>Two Major Banks Announce Closure</p>
<p>Rumors Spread Like Bees</p>
<p>Den-tsu Telegram, Mexico City, 4th: The Mexican government previously abolished the gold peso as legal tender and replaced it with the silver peso, which led to a very high degree of speculation in the silver peso. The financial world was disrupted by it, and the exchange market was closed as a result. As a result, the banks repeatedly encountered bank runs. Today, two major banks, the Banco Español de Crédito and the Banco Nacional de México, announced their closure. In order to calm people's hearts, the authorities said that it was only a temporary closure. If not handled properly, it is bound to affect the whole country and put the finances in crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, New York, 5th: Today, it is widely rumored here that a serious economic storm has occurred in Mexico City, and there are rumors that several banks have stopped paying cash. According to recent news, this warning is not based on facts, but started because a Spanish bank suspended operations for two weeks. The bank will still pay in full after reorganizing its internal affairs. There was a bank run on the Banco Nacional de México yesterday, but by the afternoon, there were fewer and fewer people withdrawing money, so the staff now believe that the bank run has subsided. The bank has no relationship with the Banco de México.</p>

<p>Naval Department Announces New Policy</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram, Washington, 4th: The Naval Department has announced its new policy, advocating that naval equipment be maintained to a standard that can be quickly expanded in wartime. The United States still intends to maintain a first-class naval power that meets the treaty requirements, but the wording will be slightly changed so that its statement does not contradict the London Treaty. Regarding the US cruiser policy, it was clearly stated two years ago that no more small cruisers would be built. Today's statement only states that the US wants to build new cruisers to maintain the tonnage allowed by the treaty. The treaty allows the United States to have 18 eight-inch gun cruisers and 143,500 tons of six-inch gun cruisers. Furthermore, the policy regarding aircraft heavier than air has been greatly expanded, and the conscription of wartime industries has been discussed.</p>

However, officials claim that they are unaware of Foreign Minister Shidehara's intention.

<p>National News Agency Telegram, New York, 4th: The New York Times published an editorial today, predicting that the Guangzhou government will soon collapse, and discussing recent news from China, briefly stating that the recent disturbances in the north and center were fleeting and withered away, which is of great importance. The central government led by Chairman Chiang has simultaneously announced that it has defeated the Kuomintang in Guangzhou in the north and dispersed the Red bandits in the south. The indestructibility of the central government has been confirmed by this. This is due to Chairman Chiang's talent and good fortune, but the loyal unity between Chairman Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang has swept away the bad habits of hypocrisy among warlords in the past, which is of great benefit to the overall situation. If the victory of the National Army in the north is indeed as reported, then the disintegration of Guangzhou is imminent. The New York Times' commentary is based on the news that the National Army has recovered Shijiazhuang and Shi Jun has collapsed.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 4th - The two items mentioned in Stalin's speech the other day regarding changes in rural policy and the treatment of middle-class engineers and experts were officially announced today by the Soviet government. The first order states that anyone who is not of the proletariat but is engaged in production, as long as they can be loyal to their work, realize the Five-Year Plan, and have no suspicion of plotting to sabotage or obstruct it, can be given worker status and enjoy full civil and economic rights. The second order temporarily relaxes the forced cooperation of agricultural farms. From now on, poor farmers who do not want to cooperate with the state can do as they please. However, at the same time, it was announced that the work of guiding farmers to organize cooperative farms in the Caucasus, the lower Volga River area, the Ukrainian region, and the Ural grain-producing area has been almost completed. At present, 82% to 95% of farmers in each of these areas have organized cooperative farms.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Dongtai - To the Shenbao and all Disaster Relief Associations: Gaoyou's Sanba dam has broken completely, turning our county into a flooded area, with residences washed away and the lives of 1.3 million people in imminent danger. We urgently request rapid disaster relief. A detailed letter will follow. The Dongtai County Party Headquarters, along with commercial, agricultural, educational, and all other groups and the entire county's population, kowtow in unison and await instructions.</p>
<p>Telegram from Yingzhou - To the Shenbao, with Compassion: Fuyang's people have unfortunately suffered repeated major disasters. Since the 15th year of the Republic (1926), military and bandit disasters have occurred one after another, and the people have been unable to provide enough aid to the dying and wounded. But Heaven does not pity us. In May of this year, hailstones the size of eggs covered about half of the county's area, damaging the wheat crop just as it was ripening. In early June, the Huai River flooded, and embankments and shoals in the southern region collapsed. The wheat crop was washed away, and rice crops were submerged, resulting in a very serious disaster. Unexpectedly, for more than fifty days between June and July, it rained continuously. At the same time, the upstream water surged, and the rivers rose even higher, making it impossible to drain the accumulated water. Not only were rice crops submerged, but even the villages and residences throughout the county were mostly submerged and washed away. The amount of water was more than two feet higher than during the flood of the tenth year of the Republic (1921). Moreover, the flood of the tenth year of the Republic was later in the season, and the sorghum was almost ripe, so some could still be harvested from the water. This year, however, the sorghum, beans, and sweet potatoes are completely hopeless, and the water is receding very slowly, making it impossible to sow green beans and buckwheat. Hundreds of thousands of lives are displaced, crying out for food, and the current situation cannot continue for long. How can we imagine the autumn, winter, and coming spring? We beseech the benevolent and virtuous of the world to embrace our suffering and, with compassion, care for the hungry and drowning. We earnestly implore you to have great mercy and either allocate funds for relief or publish our plea to spread awareness. We will be eternally grateful and await your command. The Red Cross Society of Fuyang County, Anhui Province, and the Flood Relief Association, kowtow in unison.</p>

<p>Yu Xuezhong personally oversees the battle at Fangshun Bridge</p>
<p>Jin Army successively occupies Shizhuang and Zhengding</p>
<p>Deputy Commander's Headquarters establishes a battlefield emergency relief association</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: The war on the front lines has been extremely fierce in recent days. After the various units of the Northeast Army's Second Group Army reached their destinations, they have formed a large encirclement around Shijiazhuang. The battle formations and recent developments of both sides are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on the Left Wing: Since the Northeast Army's First Group Army lured Shi Yousan's troops to their destination, they were preparing to launch a fierce attack. However, Shi's troops suddenly disappeared, and they could not be found for two or three days. Spies and reconnaissance planes made several trips to investigate, but to no avail. Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the First Army, in order to wait for the various routes of the Second Army to reach their destinations, so that they could launch a simultaneous attack, specially ordered his subordinates to stand in strict formation and wait. Until the morning of the 29th, Shi's special brigade was suddenly discovered in the Xiaoligezhuang and Zhangdengzhen areas east of the railway, attacking the defense area of Dong Yingbin's troops of the Northeast Army's left wing. Because of this attack by Shi's troops, the Northeast Army learned that the main forces of Shi Yousan, Sun Guangqian, Shen Ke, Wang Xinde, and Zhang Xitian were all east of the railway line. Therefore, the 18th Brigade on the front of the railway line was also moved east of the railway line to cooperate with the units of Chen Guanqun and Dong Yingbin to intercept them. The front of the railway line was taken over by the newly arrived Heilongjiang Grand Mixed Brigade. From the 29th to the morning of the 30th, the artillery fire in the Zhangdengzhen, Ranzhuang, and Xiaoligezhuang areas was the fiercest. Shi's troops launched repeated fierce attacks, but were all repelled. On the evening of the 30th, Yu Xuezhong specially sent staff members Fang Huating and Zhao Yong to the front to inspect everything.</p>
<p>Bombing of Ranzhuang: On the morning of the 30th, a report was received stating that Shi's troops were all hiding in Ranzhuang village. Chen Honglu, Captain of the Aviation Corps, dispatched seven planes to bomb Ranzhuang in the morning. Ranzhuang is surrounded by water on all sides, and the village is full of houses. The planes bombed in teams simultaneously, first bombing the southwest corner, then the west corner, and then the southeast corner. Many of Shi's infantry were killed in the bombings. Finally, four bombs were dropped on a grove in the northeast corner. Shi's artillerymen then pulled out four or five gun carriages and fled out of the west gate. The rest that were damaged were abandoned in the grove. The planes pursued them to outside the west gate and dropped four or five more bombs, and Shi's troops fled.</p>
<p>Deployment for General Offensive: The battles east of the railway line in recent days can be described as fierce, but they are still local battles. The formal general offensive is still waiting for the encirclement to be fully deployed. As of the 31st, the various units of the Second Army had reached their destinations. The Second Army's formation is as follows: the 20th Brigade's Chang Jingwu's troops are stationed in Gaoyang, forming a link with the First Army at Zhangdengzhen. The 15th Brigade's Yao Dongfan's troops and Huang Shiyue's Brigade crossed the Henan border and advanced to Gaoyang. The 1st Cavalry Brigade's Guo Xipeng, in coordination with the 2nd Cavalry Division, arrived in Raoyang, preparing to advance towards Zhengding and Xinle, cutting off the retreat of Shi Yousan's troops.</p>
<p>Yu Personally Oversees the Battle: Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the First Army, believed that the deployment of all routes had been completed and that a general offensive could be launched simultaneously. For the convenience of command, Yu specially ordered all personnel in the unit at 4:00 AM on the 31st to prepare to personally set out to oversee the battle. The Adjutant's Office prepared Yu's special train. By about 9:00 AM, all personnel had completed their preparations. Only one section chief and two or three staff members were left in each department of the Baoding Military Headquarters to work in Baoding. The rest accompanied Yu. Yu boarded the train at 11:00 AM and set off for Fangshun Bridge. The military headquarters will advance forward with the army. When Yu left, he told people at the station that the Northeast First and Second Armies had been linked up, and the Central Army and the Jin Army were also advancing forward. Tonight or tomorrow morning, the encircling forces from all routes will launch a simultaneous general offensive. Shi is already surrounded on all sides. A clear victory or defeat can be determined within three days after the general offensive. (July 31st)</p>
<p>The Jin Army is Dispatched: Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the Shi troops problem arose, rumors about the Jin faction have been rampant, and the price of Jin currency has plummeted to $3.80. After the joint telegram of the North China generals was issued, the rumors subsided. Unexpectedly, the news that Xu Yongchang had returned to Taiyuan spread, and rumors arose again for a time. According to our investigation, the attitudes of the various generals are extremely clear. After Xu returned to Taiyuan, the generals held a banquet at the Zhengtai Hotel to welcome him back. During the banquet, they discussed sending troops to punish Shi. It was faintly heard that during the negotiations, although some people argued that Shi Yousan's forces were weak and that the Northeast and Central Armies could easily resolve the situation with a pincer attack from the north and south, the majority advocated that the Jin Army should, on the one hand, make contact with Sun and Pang's troops to prevent Shi's troops from collapsing and fleeing to Shanxi, and on the other hand, mobilize a large force to attack its rear and flanks from Niangzi Pass, in order to quickly end the military situation. It was decided that Shang Zhen would be the commanding general, because Shang had received a telegram from the Central Government a few days ago, ordering him to lead his troops out of Niangzi Pass. After receiving the order, Shang made considerable preparations and transferred a large sum of money from the Finance Reorganization Office and the Opium Suppression Office for use by the brigades of Gao Hongwen and Huang Guanghua under his command. After Shang set off, the provincial chairman was replaced by Qiu Zengyi. As for the issue of military pay, Shanxi Province is really unable to raise funds again and will be subsidized by the Central Government and the Deputy Commander's Headquarters. As soon as Fu Shuangying arrives in Taiyuan, there will be concrete measures. It is also heard that in addition to telegraphing Shang Zhen to lead his troops to attack Shi Yousan, the Central Government also telegraphed Gao Guizi and Pang Bingxun to lead their troops and join Shang's troops in attacking.</p>
<p>On July 30th, Shang Zhen transferred the Jin Army out of Niangzi Pass. On August 1st, the General Staff Office of the Army telegraphed Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) to report the dispatch of troops and the occupation of Shizhuang and Zhengding. The telegram stated, "Limited to immediate arrival, Shi's rebel forces are causing chaos and destroying unity. Our Army Commander Shang Zhen, in accordance with the telegram order of General and Deputy Commander Jiang and Zhang, dispatched troops to Shizhuang to attack the enemy's flanks. On July 30th, Gao Hongwen's brigade stationed in Meijing, JIngxing, Hengshui, and Shouyang, and Huang Guanghua's brigade stationed in Jingxing. On the morning of the 31st at 4:00 AM, Gao's brigade advanced to Huolu. After getting off the train, they selected 400 brave men and advanced towards Shizhuang. The entire brigade advanced in two columns. After arriving at the line of Daguo Village and Zhentou, they repelled the enemy's advancing troops and then approached the enemy's Currency Yuan area west of Shizhuang. The enemy's troops, about two regiments, resisted stubbornly. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's forces were unsustainable, and Shizhuang was completely occupied at 10:00 AM on the 31st. Most of the remaining enemies retreated towards Zhengding, and a part fled eastward. More than 30 enemies were captured, along with dozens of rifles. Huang Guanghua's brigade advanced eastward into Shizhuang at noon and ordered Gao's brigade to pursue them closely. The enemies relied on the dangerous terrain on the north bank of the Hutuo River to resist. After three hours of fierce fighting, the remaining enemies were finally defeated and fled northeast. Gao's brigade then occupied Zhengding at 5:00 PM on the evening of the 31st. After being intercepted by our army, Shi's rebels were cut off at both ends, and knowing that their general situation was gone, their morale was scattered, and they were unable to fight again. They withdrew the main force from the Wangdu area and fled eastward. Our Gao's brigade, in addition to leaving a part stationed in Zhengding, still pursued them. One regiment of Huang's brigade was dispatched to join forces in attacking in the direction of Wuji. Army Commander Shang Zhen is temporarily stationed in Shijiazhuang and is waiting for orders to advance. Our northern and southern armies are also pursuing and annihilating the chief culprit, and the time is not far off. Special telegram reported, General Staff Office of the 32nd Army, Dong."</p>
<p>Battlefield Emergency Relief: Beiping News: Deputy Commander Zhang believes that the war is about to end and that the disaster victims in the war zone are displaced and in urgent need of relief. He has instructed the staff of the Deputy Commander's Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to organize a Battlefield Emergency Relief Committee. Secretary-General Wang of the Headquarters, after receiving the instructions, immediately asked Zhu Guangmu to invite Qian Junren, of the Beiping Office of the Relief Committee, to the Headquarters to discuss organizational matters. After receiving the telegram, Qian immediately went. According to Qian, "Secretary-General Wang and Director Zhu invited me (Qian himself) to the Headquarters to discuss battlefield emergency relief matters and asked for my help, which is my duty. After two consultations, a general decision has been made. The relief supplies are divided into two categories: relief funds and relief grain, both of which will be planned by the Headquarters. Personnel will be dispatched to various war zones within days to conduct investigations. After the investigation, relief will be provided separately according to the situation, in order to show condolences. The committee has decided to set up its headquarters in Baoding and will go there to organize it within days. Only an office will be set up in Beiping, inside the Headquarters. As for the organization of the committee, I have drafted the articles of association and submitted them to the Headquarters. As soon as they are approved, they can be implemented." The Headquarters also announced, "We have just received instructions from the Deputy Commander that the Headquarters will organize a Battlefield Emergency Relief Association, which will be established within two days. It has been decided to transport large quantities of rice and flour and funds for military use to the war zone. First, reception centers will be set up, and then investigations will be conducted into the losses suffered by the people due to the war, and compensation will be made as appropriate, and condolences will be given to the wounded and dead.

<h3 id="e63">Field Notes on the Korean Incident (Continued) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Essential Hopes of Overseas Chinese: After this unprecedented catastrophe, the overseas Chinese are extremely worried that the Koreans will commit a second act of violence. Those who have no property or family ties have packed up their businesses and returned home to take refuge temporarily. When there is an opportunity in the future, they will reside there again and revive their businesses. Those who have real estate and movable property that cannot be disposed of immediately are eager to sell them off or find someone to take over. Before leaving Korea, they earnestly hope that their compatriots in China will follow a proper path for anti-Japanese and anti-Korean movements and must avoid direct conflicts and using retaliatory measures, so that the overseas Chinese will not be sacrificed needlessly again. On this point, the overseas Chinese in Pyongyang and Gyeongseong have repeatedly pleaded with the reporter to convey this to China. Recently, when the anti-foreign goods movement occurred in China, overseas Chinese merchants in Korea encountered equivalent boycotts by Japanese and Koreans. If there are no unrestrained actions in China, the Japanese and Koreans may not dare to engage in illegal actions against our overseas Chinese again. Although overseas Chinese merchants have suffered losses, they are all determined to persevere, but the situation is difficult, and the Chinese people should understand this. Since the Korean Incident occurred, the government has only sent Minister Wang Rongbao to Korea to investigate and has not sent any special envoys to express condolences. In the future, what the overseas Chinese urgently want to discuss with the central government is that the consulates stationed there have lost the trust of the general overseas Chinese population. They are unwilling to consult with them on any matter. We do not know the reason for this. Recently, the Zhenhai warship of the First Fleet of the Northeast Navy, representing the government, went to Incheon and Zhennampo to express condolences to the overseas Chinese. Although the overseas Chinese in various places did not receive any practical benefits, the concept of the motherland has been particularly deepened. At present, the number of casualties and losses in various places is only being determined by the chambers of commerce in various places, without a systematic investigation. There is no legal basis, and the exact number of losses cannot be determined. The consulates have only reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a perfunctory manner and have not conducted any on-the-ground investigations or taken any measures to provide relief, which is enough to disappoint hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>A General Overview of Japan's Management of Korea: Japan's management of Korea, viewed from a flat perspective, is benevolent and guiding; viewed from a three-dimensional perspective, it is high-handed and severe. It fundamentally divides the Korean people into several different groups. For the elderly, it allows them to live in peace and enjoy themselves. It not only does not destroy the old Korean etiquette and customs but also promotes them. It allows them to follow their social customs and does not suppress them as long as they do not harm public welfare and hygiene, so that the general remnants of the Three Han kingdoms enjoy a life of peace and prosperity and no longer think of Shu. For the young people, it uses specially formulated educational methods to educate them separately, subtly transforming them and causing them to forget their origins and the concept of the motherland, and automatically regard themselves as being on par with the Japanese. They wear Japanese clothing and speak Japanese, know nothing of Korea, and do their best to eliminate their pro-China thoughts and educate them that Japan and Korea were originally one race. Therefore, the emerging Koreans have a lighter concept of the motherland, and their anti-China actions are becoming increasingly fierce. As for the overall construction of Korea, Japan sets up what is beneficial to Japan itself. What is not related to Japan but is needed by the Korean people, Japan generally does not promote. Throughout the eight provinces of Korea, as far as the reporter has seen, there are virtually no projects purely created by the Korean people. That is, in Huangzhou in Hwanghae Province and Zhennampo in South Pyongan Province, sericulture, beekeeping, cotton cultivation, and fruit cultivation are all managed by the Japanese. They all implement new methods. The Koreans who raise silkworms and plant mulberry trees using old methods have lost their ability to compete and are gradually decreasing. In Japan, primary education for children is compulsory. In Korea, however, it is left to nature, and the Japanese government does not interfere with whether or not children of school age attend school. Therefore, the streets are filled with playful children. However, when Korean children need to study, they are not allowed to establish their own academies or organize any schools as a group. They must attend Japanese government schools. Important workers in factories are not Korean. When necessary, the Japanese will summon Japanese from their own country to fill the positions or replace them with Chinese, but they will not allow Koreans to participate. Therefore, the Koreans have remained ignorant and dull for the past twenty years. At the same time, the Koreans' laziness is evident everywhere. Judging from the actions of the general public, it is even more evident that they deserve the misfortune of losing their country. On the way from Pyongyang to Zhennampo, the reporter saw a Korean who looked like a farmer enter and sit in a second-class carriage. A Japanese policeman, who was a ticket inspector, saw him and asked for his ticket. He replied that he had not bought one and was asked why he had not bought one, but he remained silent. He was ordered to sit in a third-class carriage and buy a ticket, but he still did not speak. He was driven off the train, but he did not move. It was not until the Japanese became angry and summoned their comrades, who grabbed him and dragged him away, that he hurriedly took out money to buy a ticket. This also shows one aspect of his servility. There are only two Korean newspapers in all of Korea (not including those run by the Japanese). One is the Chosun Ilbo, which is controlled by the Governor-General's Office, and the other is the Dong-A Ilbo, which, although its attitude is relatively moderate, is often punished with suspension. Although there are occasionally magazines and other publications run by Koreans, they all have a Japanese background or are supervised from the side. Korean knowledge is simple, and there is no such thing as thought. The independence parties that call out overseas are just a few knowledgeable people. Judging from the domestic situation in Korea, not to mention the strict precautions of the Japanese army, even if it were not, it would be difficult for these people to restore their country and recover their lost territory. Heavy Japanese troops are stationed in Gyeongseong, Pyongyang, and Sinuiju. It is said that there are about 70,000 artillery and infantry troops. There is also an air force stationed in Pyongyang. Airplanes take off in the air every day, nominally for training, but in reality, it is nothing less than a warning to the Koreans not to have any illusions. Incheon is a port for both commercial and military use. The sea mouth is eighteen feet deep. Ships with deeper drafts must enter specially built docks to dock. Three sides of the dock are walled with stones, and three gates are set up. When the tide rises, the water is closed in the dock, and the average depth is thirty-five feet, so large ships can still be anchored alongside. Zhennampo is the base of the Second Fleet of the Japanese Navy. The two mountains on either side of the port face each other and have a commanding position. The Second Fleet has four ships that are permanently docked. The internal and external defenses are very strict.</p>
<p>The Journey from Liaoning to Andong: The Anfeng Railway from Liaoning to Andong is 550 li long. The South Manchuria Railway express train departs from Liaoning at 3:25 PM and arrives in Andong at 9:00 PM. The section from Liaoning to Benxihu is a double track, while the section from Benxihu to Andong is a single track. After passing Sujiatun, the mountains rise and fall continuously until Benxihu. The barren mountains, except for moss, are completely bare and without a single blade of grass or tree. The river forks are winding, and the water is mixed with mud and sand, turbid, shallow, and narrow, making it unusable. Most of the farmland is cultivated on the mountain foothills, scattered and broken, without half an acre of flat land. The saying in Guizhou, "People have no three fen of silver, and the land has no three chi of level ground," can be applied to this area. However, the mountains are mostly granite, and the faults are loose and easy to dig, and lime fossils and the like can be obtained everywhere. If we take advantage of local conditions, fossil mines and lime mines can be opened. The coal, iron, and limestone mines in Benxihu are one example of what the Japanese have established. Above Benxihu, there are overlapping mountains and swamps, and the forests and grasslands are endless. The farmland is becoming increasingly scarce, and the houses are mostly built against the mountains, and there are many stone houses. Three or five households can be found every few tens of miles. The population density is as sparse as in northern Manchuria. Except for the railway, it is impossible to see where the paths are. Residents who have not lived there for a long time already find transportation extremely difficult. The towns passed, such as Sujiatun, Lianshanguan, Jiguan Mountain, Wulongbei, and Fenghuangcheng, are relatively well-known, but the desolation of the markets is no different from the countryside. The supply of materials, apart from imports from Japan and the sale of foreign goods, is limited to coarse cloth for domestic goods. The Anfeng Line is built in the Wanshan Mountains, tunneling through mountains and building bridges over streams. The track is tortuous and often meanders through slopes and valleys. There are more than 30 bridges and tunnels, and the scale of the project is several times that of the main line of the South Manchuria Railway. The places passed, such as Motianling and Jiguan Mountain, are all natural barriers on the east side, with a shape that can be defended by one man against ten thousand. The Japanese have built extremely strong forts in all of these places, and other places can also be defended. It is a pity that this kind of dangerous place has already been occupied by the Japanese. Looking at what we see, we cannot help but sigh. Andong is the southeastern gateway to Liaoning. The Anfeng Road connects from Korea, like an arm reaching in, breaking through the gateway and reaching the hall. Although there are dangers such as Yuanshan Mountain and Zhengjiang Mountain facing each other, it is equal to nothing. The reporter took a round trip on the Anfeng Line. The passengers I rode with, except for a group of three who were Chinese, were all Japanese, either merchants returning home from the mainland or people from their country coming to the Northeast for inspection. They were bustling and busy. Being among them, we felt like we were sitting on pins and needles. Andong used to be a large city, with merchants gathering and markets thriving. Shahezi was especially prosperous. Due to the repeated anti-China actions in Korea, foreign trade and the population have sharply decreased, and the prosperity is no longer what it used to be. The city has a population of only about 100,000, and the number of Japanese and Koreans who have moved in is close to 70,000. The local area has already been reduced to a semi-colony. Everything looks to the Japanese, which is also heartbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Commemoration of Deceased Overseas Chinese Compatriots in Liaoning <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The General Assembly Passed Five Resolutions to Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Negotiations</p>
<p>And Voted to Plan an Economic Embargo Against Japan</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: On the afternoon of August 2nd, representatives from all sectors of Liaoning gathered at the Butterfly Grand Theater south of the Drum Tower in the city to hold a memorial service for the overseas Chinese compatriots who perished in Korea. More than 500 representatives from various agencies and groups attended. The meeting commenced at 11:30 a.m., presided over by Yan Yuheng. Mournful music was played, and formal respects were paid. The chairman presented a wreath and read a eulogy. Subsequently, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Liu Ziping, a representative of the afflicted overseas Chinese in Pyongyang, described the disasters and riots that had occurred. He stated that the tragedy of the overseas Chinese in Pyongyang was the worst of all regions. The property losses there were estimated to be over five million yuan. The number of deaths and injuries, based on what the Japanese could not conceal, each reached two hundred. Those whose fate was unknown or who sustained minor injuries also exceeded one hundred. Currently, about two thousand have fled back to Andong, and about four thousand two hundred have fled back to Yantai. More than a thousand remain in Pyongyang, scattered and destitute, awaiting death without any means of assistance. Taking our representatives as an example, we are originally from Shandong and have been doing business in Pyongyang for many years. Now, all the hard-earned gains of half a lifetime have been lost. We cannot maintain our livelihood in the future. The situation of overseas Chinese in Korea is similar, and it is unknown how many are in this predicament, etc. His words were extremely sorrowful, and the entire assembly was stirred up. Finally, the general assembly put forward five demands, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to Japan via telegram. The entire assembly unanimously passed the following: (1) Punish the perpetrators and those responsible; (2) Compensate for all losses; (3) Apologize to our government; (4) Guarantee that such unfortunate events will not occur again in the future; (5) Our government should send troops to Korea to protect overseas Chinese. It was also resolved that the Foreign Affairs Association should plan an economic embargo against Japan. Subsequently, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Circumstances of the Murder of the 34th Division Commander <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Regimental Commander Wang Junjie Was the Mastermind of the Murder</p>
<p>And Falsely Used the Name of the Entire Division to Usurp He's Position</p>
<p>The Headquarters Arrested Him for Strict Interrogation and Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The original commander of the 34th Army Division was Yue Weijun. Later, because Yue was besieged during the suppression of the communists, the Wuhan Headquarters ordered He Zhenfan, the chief of staff of the division, to temporarily act as commander. Recently, news came that He had died in his defense area. The Headquarters then ordered Regimental Commander Wang Junjie to act as division commander. Now, it has been found that He Zhenfan was actually assassinated by Wang Junjie. The reason is that Wang Junjie was under He's command, and their opinions had always been inconsistent. Recently, in order to expand his own strength, he instructed soldiers in the Xiantao defense area to shoot and kill He Zhenfan, the acting division commander. Subsequently, he falsely used the names of the division officers to send a joint telegram requesting that Wang succeed as division commander. The wording was absurd and bordered on coercion. He Chengjun, the director of the Headquarters, had already learned of Wang's plot to seize military power and assassinate his superior. However, because Wang was leading troops in the defense area, he feared that acting too hastily would incite a rebellion. Therefore, he temporarily showed tolerance and allowed him to succeed in order to reassure him. A few days ago, Director He telegraphed Wang, saying that there were important matters to discuss in person, urging him to come to Hankou quickly. Wang believed it to be true and arrived on time. He then had Wang arrested and escorted to the Headquarters military law office yesterday. He also reported to the commander-in-chief and organized a military law trial for strict interrogation and thorough investigation in order to punish the lawless and enforce military discipline. As for the vacancies of the 34th Division commander and the regimental commander, Regimental Commander Zhang Wanxin has been appointed as acting division commander, and Jiang Hongmo has been promoted to acting regimental commander, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Tragic Scene of the Yangtze River Flood <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang and Wuhu are Vast and Featureless; Trains, Airplanes, and Telegrams are All Suspended</p>
<p>Embankments Collapsed, Houses, Livestock, and Crops Were Swept Away</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Sent Urgent Reports of the Disaster; the Provincial Relief Conference Hastened Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province Correspondence: For the past few days, there has been continuous rain and cold weather. As the saying goes, "Summer cold brings flooding," and indeed it has come to pass. According to those who have come from Jiujiang to the province, the Yangtze River flood has caused widespread disaster, and all the major commercial ports along the river have been submerged. The fields and villages on both banks are even worse. Since the 25th, low-lying areas in Jiujiang City, such as the roads along the river, South Gate Lake, Longchi Temple, and West Gate, have been flooded. Most of the shops have closed. Recently, as the water level continued to rise, all the roads were several feet deep, and traffic was cut off, requiring boats for transportation. Most residents have moved upstairs or relocated elsewhere. The daily necessities for those avoiding the flood must be purchased by small boats, and the boatmen are making several times their usual profit. The Yangtze River vessels cannot dock because their hawsers have been broken, and the pontoons are floating uncontrollably. Passengers must use small boats to get on and off the ships, but the wind is strong, and the waves are high, so the small boats often capsize, making it extremely dangerous. The Jiujiang airfield has also been several feet underwater recently, and planes from Shanghai and Chengdu cannot land, causing airmail to be suspended. The Shahe, Tujiapu, and Yongxiu areas of the Nanxun Railway are flooded by mountain torrents and river water, and much of the railway bridge and track have been submerged or washed away, so the railway has been closed since the 27th. Mail from Jiujiang to the province is piled up like mountains. It has been five days since a train from Shanghai has arrived in this city. Although mail from the Nanxun line is now being sent by small steamers, it takes at least two days to arrive. Many of the telegraph lines along the Yangtze River have been submerged or washed away, and all lines from the province to Shanghai and Hankou are completely cut off. Official telegrams are being sent by wireless, but because of the congestion of official telegrams, commercial telegrams have been temporarily suspended, causing extreme slowness in receiving news from this province. Merchants have no knowledge of market conditions in Shanghai and other ports. This is the situation regarding the difficulty of transportation in southern Jiangxi. As for the disaster situation, according to news from Jiujiang, the embankments in Jiujiang, Pengze, Hukou, Ruichang, Xingzi and other counties in northern Jiangxi along the river have been completely destroyed. Crops such as early rice and soybeans that were about to be harvested have been completely lost. Chickens, dogs, cattle, sheep and other livestock have been swept away. On the riverbanks and embankments, small houses have been swept away by the waves, and only the roofs of the tall houses are visible. According to a gentleman who came from Hankou to the province yesterday, from Hankou to Jiujiang, the water and sky blend into one color, with only a few treetops and sails visible. The carcasses of dead livestock and destroyed belongings float up and down with the waves, which is extremely tragic. In a village in Chi Kou, hundreds of thatched and brick houses are now nowhere to be seen. On Laozhoutou at the mouth of the Yangtze River in Hukou, there are more than one hundred houses and more than one thousand residents, but now only a few dozen roofs are visible, with the victims wailing on top. The water of Poyang Lake is discharged from the Yangtze River, but now the water of the Yangtze River is flowing back into the lake. In addition, mountain torrents from the Gan River and Rao River basins have overflowed the riverbanks, causing widespread flooding. The Poyang and Duchang areas have become a vast marsh, and the early rice crops have been completely destroyed. The situation is similar in the areas along the Yuan River and Gan River basins, but slightly less severe. As of today, the counties that have reported disasters include Pengze, Hukou, Yongxiu, Xinjian, Poyang, Dean, Shanggao, Fengcheng, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ruichang, etc. The Provincial Relief Committee is currently preparing for emergency relief, and the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Department of Construction is also receiving funds from the Department of Finance and sending personnel to the embankments in northern Jiangxi for emergency repairs.

<h3 id="e67">The Water Level Still Rises After Opening the Chelou Dam <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Mao Yisheng Reports the Water Situation to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Approves Opening Two More Dams in Case of Emergency</p>
<p>This year's flood in Jiangsu Province has caused disaster, and the water level in the Grand Canal is rising daily. On the 2nd of this month, the Chelou Dam in Gaoyou was opened, but in less than a day, the watermark at Yumatou rose another inch (reaching one zhang, eight chi, and nine cun). Mao Yisheng, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, returned to the province from Gaoyou yesterday (the 4th) and attended a meeting of the Provincial Government to report on the water situation. The Provincial Government immediately decided on the following measures for the counties to protect the embankments: (1) The entire eastern embankment of each county should be raised, temporarily set at three chi above the current water level, i.e., to resist water at two zhang and two cun (Yumatou watermark); the western embankment should be raised by referring to the eastern embankment and the situation west of the embankment; (2) All eastern and western embankments near cities, towns, and villages will be the responsibility of the county to which they belong, and all labor, materials, and expenses will be handled by the respective counties; (3) All eastern and western embankments outside the scope of the preceding provisions will be the responsibility of the Water Conservancy Bureau, but the respective counties should be responsible for recruiting laborers; (4) Each county along the river should recruit 1,500 laborers for the Water Conservancy Bureau, send personnel to lead them to work, and be subject to dispatch, with food provided by the Bureau; (5) The Water Conservancy Bureau will send personnel to each county to work with the county magistrate to demarcate responsible areas. Item 6 of the matters discussed by the Provincial Government that day stated that Director Mao and others telegraphed from Gaoyou on the 3rd, stating that the water still rose to 1.89 after opening the Chelou Dam yesterday, and that opening the Nanxin and Liang Dams would be necessary to avert danger, requesting instructions on the matter. It was resolved that the Nanxin and Liang Dams would be approved to be opened if the water level continued to rise unabated and was deemed to be dangerous. That day, Mao Yisheng left the province to inspect the water situation along the canal. It is reported that the Huai River in Bengbu has slightly receded in recent days. (August 5th)</p>

<p>The Sodomy Case of a Lawyer Sent Back for Retrial: Shanghai lawyer Ren Zhennan was accused by his wife, Jiang Xingjuan, of sodomy and assault. The Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office ruled to dismiss the case. Jiang Xingjuan refused to accept the decision and filed a petition with the High Court to request a review. The High Prosecutor's Office attached great importance to this case and has already ruled to send it back to the Shanghai District Court for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Appeal Hearing of the Nun's Theft Case: Qing Shan, a nun from the Lujia Guanyin Hall on Changbang Road, Shanghai, colluded with Zhang Youren to illegally sell 2.6 mu of temple property and cemetery land in Xujiawan to others. They exhumed and relocated seven coffins to the International Cemetery, earning a total of 5,200 yuan. After the elderly nun Jin Lin discovered this, she sued in the Shanghai District Court, which sentenced Qing Shan to three years in prison and acquitted Zhang Youren. Qing Shan refused to accept the decision and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 5th), a hearing was held, but because additional evidence was needed, the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Rejection of Wu Lien-teh: The Suzhou Anti-Drug Association telegraphed the National Government's Anti-Smoking Committee, stating: "Previously, your committee complied with public opinion and abolished the Anti-Smoking Investigation Office, the news of which gladdened the entire country. However, newspapers are reporting that a National Narcotics Management Office will be established, and Mr. Wu Lien-teh has just returned from overseas. Commentators suspect that this is a disguised form of the Investigation Office, and Wu will be appointed as its director to reward his advocacy of public sale. We know that your committee is thoroughly banning smoking and will not make the same mistake twice. However, unfounded rumors may become reality. Therefore, we urgently request you to issue a statement to dispel rumors and reject Mr. Wu to distance ourselves from villainous individuals and maintain credibility."</p>

<p>The Finance Bureau Seeks Bids for Contracting the Feast Donation: Wang Jingzhi, the Director of the County Finance Bureau, stated that the county's feast education donation had previously been contracted to Xu Shide, a merchant, until the end of June of this year. After the contract was terminated, former Director Shen notified all restaurants to continue collecting donations as before and await assignment for collection. At the same time, a notice was issued inviting merchants to bid. However, after two deadlines, no one bid, and the donation collection was suspended, leaving education expenses without funding. This was brought up at a county administration meeting, and it was resolved that for July of this year, the Finance Bureau would audit the accounts of each restaurant to verify and collect the donations, and at the same time, quickly invite merchants to bid for contracting the donation. It should be noted that the original target amount was 24,000 yuan per year, but it has now been reduced to 18,000 yuan. The public bidding is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Suspected of Theft, Resentment Leads to Self-Harm: A resident in the No. 53 workshop of the Jinji Silk Factory outside the West Gate of our county, a detective Wu from the Water Police District, had a white Xiangyun silk gown stolen by a thief a few days ago. He conducted a thorough investigation, but there were no clues. Unexpectedly, Jiang Asi, who lived with him, thought that even though he had not committed the theft, he could not avoid suspicion due to their cohabitation. He felt extremely resentful. At 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Asi left alone and went to a tavern to drink heavily. After returning home, he took a kitchen knife and slashed his head several times, causing blood to flow immediately, and he fell to the ground unconscious. His elder brother, Bingkui, found him and immediately hired a car to take him to the Puren Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were severe, and his life was in danger.</p>
<p>Bandits Robbed Repeatedly; One Was Captured: On the night of the 4th, at around 10:00 p.m., more than ten bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Zhang Fuguan, a villager in Xuehuaijiang Village near Zhangcun Town in the fifth district of our county (Tianshang City). Each of them carried fake handguns and appeared fierce, intending to rob. At that time, Zhang's family, both men and women, were cooling off in the open space. When they saw the bandits arrive, they dared not speak. The bandits then rushed into the house and robbed them extensively, taking more than ten yuan in silver. They then went to the northern street of Shitou Town to rob a net-carrying boat parked on the riverbank. As a result, the boat owner's wife's gold earrings were also robbed, with a total loss of about twenty yuan. Dissatisfied, the bandits went to Xie Renguan's home in Shenxiang Village in Xintangli and aimed a fake handgun at Xie Renguan, pretending to fire. When Renguan saw this, he knew it was a fake gun and immediately gathered his neighbors to bravely capture the bandit. One bandit was captured on the spot. Later, the captured bandit was identified as a local villager.</p>
<p>Bandits Sent Letters Demanding Huge Sums of Money: Wang Shaoxian, a resident of Cotton Lane outside the South Gate of our county, is a wealthy merchant from Anhui living in Wuxi, and a shareholder of the Gansheng Silk Factory under the Gongyun Bridge. He is now over sixty years old and quite famous for his wealth. Recently, he suddenly received a threatening letter from Shanghai, which stated that he should lend 20,000 silver dollars, otherwise, unfavorable measures would be taken against him. After Wang received the letter, he burned it. This was discovered by Wang Weixin, the director of the third branch of the Public Security Bureau, who immediately sent a police officer to investigate and secretly deployed police to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>A Vast Area Reported Crop Failure Due to the Flood: Since the beginning of summer, our county has been experiencing continuous rain and rising river water. Low-lying fields in the countryside have turned into marshes, and farmers are displaced, which is unbearable to see. Moreover, the green seedlings have rotted, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The disastrous situation is rare in recent years. Zhu Chenghong, the head of the fifth district, and Yu Shangshu, the head of the eleventh district, have recently received reports of crop failure from the town chiefs and farmers in their respective districts. In Tianshang City, 2,000 mu of fields marked "Qiu," 800 mu marked "Lie," and 500 mu marked "Xue" have been affected. In the Ganlu Town area of Nanyan City, more than ten thousand mu have been affected. Yesterday, the district reported the situation to the County Government, requesting that personnel be sent to the countryside to investigate the disaster and seek relief.</p>

<p>Provincial Government Executes Bandit Leader for Kidnapping: The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in the case of the kidnapping of Wu Jiaxiang, a wealthy merchant from Cixi, and his son, and the extortion of 28,400 yuan, ordered the execution of bandit leader Cheng Guoliang, also known as Wang Agen, who had a knife scar about an inch long on his face. He was recognized by Wu Shenshi, the wife of the victim Wu Jiaxiang, who encountered him at a small vegetable market in Hongkou, Shanghai, and tracked him to his residence. Later, Yao County captured Zhang Guoming, an accomplice in the case, who had already been approved for execution. He also confessed the name and address of Cheng Guoliang, which matched the information obtained by Wu Shenshi. The provincial government sent detectives to Shanghai to arrest and bring him to justice. However, the criminal cunningly refused to confess. The victim was summoned to court for questioning, and it was proven that the criminal was present and involved in the kidnapping from the beginning to the repeated negotiations and payment of money. The evidence was solid, and he was sentenced to death in accordance with the regulations for punishing kidnappers. Yesterday (the 5th) at 8 a.m., officials were sent to bring the bandit leader forward, verify his identity, and escort him to the Qingbomen execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

All regulations have been promulgated by the National Government. This public bond is specifically used to clean up old debts and should be raised through various means in order to repay the old debts separately. In 1929, the province issued construction public bonds and sent a letter to your office requesting that salt merchants be persuaded to subscribe on behalf of the province, but this was not approved. Now, we reiterate the previous proposal and change the subscription to 500,000 yuan in public bonds to clean up old debts. We hope that you will immediately convene various salt merchants to allocate subscriptions separately and order them to pay the funds as soon as possible for prompt transfer."</p>

<p>Ordered to Abolish the Municipal Committee: After the abolition of the Ningbo Municipal Government, all municipal affairs are handled by the Yin County Government. However, citizens believe that the scope of municipal affairs being merged into the Yin County Government is too large, and they advocate for the establishment of a Yin County Municipal Committee to assist the government. The regulations and election methods of the committee have been approved and promulgated by the provincial government. Furthermore, the Yin County Government has been ordered to select ten members of the Municipal Committee from among the village chiefs of the Village and Village Committees and report them to the provincial government for approval. Now it is learned that after receiving the administrative report from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Ministry of Interior believes that the organization of the committee not only has no legal basis but also retains a municipal agency after the abolition of the Municipal Government, which may hinder the administrative system. Therefore, the ministry immediately sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, urging it to change the merger in order to comply with the regulations. After receiving the letter, the provincial government decided at the provincial affairs meeting to order the Yin County Government to inform the Municipal Committee to abolish the report. The Yin County Government has received this order yesterday and will report the abolition of the Municipal Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Minutes of the Veterinary Education Promotion Association Meeting <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The China Veterinary Education Promotion Association held its second meeting the day before yesterday. Cai Wuji, Wang Zhaoji, Ye Hancheng, Shen Jiucheng, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao and others attended the meeting and resolved the following matters: (1) Revised and approved the association's rules. (2) The association's location is temporarily set up at the China Vocational Education Society. (3) Mr. Yang Weiyu was recommended to handle the association's filing procedures. (4) Add charitable words to the purpose of the veterinary vocational school to arouse the attention of philanthropists. (5) In addition to the 40 student places in the medical vocational school, add 10 elective student places. (Both male and female students are admitted, focusing on animal husbandry) (6) Recommend Zou Bingwen, Cai Wuji, Wang Zhaoji, Ye Hancheng, Shen Jiucheng, Yang Weiyu, and Pan Yangyao as standing committee members of the association. The purpose book for establishing the veterinary vocational school, which was published yesterday, is explored as follows: The basis of human life is nothing more than three kinds of moving plants and minerals, especially animals are the largest. All the needs of food, clothing, housing and transportation are related to livestock and poultry. There are meat, milk, eggs, wool, feathers, and service. We take their strengths as a resource to use for our life. The contribution of beasts and birds to human life should be very great. Since science is prosperous and academic evolution, human beings already have eugenics, and beasts and birds also have selective breeding methods. Pure breeds require strength, and their reproduction and growth are required, and inferior breeds must be eliminated. With the power of artificial, to make up for the lack of natural, not only to help the economy, but also to benefit the people. It is the duty of a veterinarian to examine and inspect the diseases and ailments of beasts and birds and to treat them, just as humans have diseases and seek treatment from doctors, and beasts and birds are also living animals. Recently, in Europe, the United States and other countries, medicine is prosperous, and it has progressed from treating people to treating beasts and birds. There are schools for training, and there are specialized talents. They have close relationships in hygiene administration, agricultural technology, commodity inspection, and type improvement. Excellent breeds can be used to produce a large number of fruits, which can prevent the spread of inferior breeds and prevent diseases and pests of beasts and birds. The strengths of the beasts and birds are used to give them their effect. Veterinarians are really meeting the requirements of the times and occupying an important position today. Recently, science is prevalent in my country, and new policies have been introduced one after another. Since the selection of species, animal husbandry, aquaculture, slaughter, disease, commodity inspection, manufacturing and other important tasks, specialized talents are needed to manage them, and the most lacking are veterinarians. Shanghai is a major port in southeastern China, and it occupies an important position in the world. Recently, various businesses have been organized in order, but no attention has been paid to the facilities of veterinary education, which is a disease for those who know it. Everyone has a heart of empathy. Since there is medical treatment for human poverty and illness, the diseases of beasts and birds should also be treated equally. Therefore, in the spirit of the Western Inscription, the people of my country are compatriots and the world is involved. The establishment of veterinary medicine is also a kind of charity. Therefore, veterinary experts, administrative authorities, and education comrades are gathered together to form a committee to promote veterinary education. We will earnestly study the plan for training veterinary talents to meet the technical needs of agricultural administrative agencies, health administrative agencies, agricultural education agencies, and commodity inspection agencies in various provinces and cities. First, we will entrust the China Vocational Education Society to run the veterinary vocational school. The curriculum should not be too deep, but be practical. The level should not be too high, but be appropriate. Take theory as the foundation and practice as the application. The meaning is nothing more than to arouse the concept of the Chinese people's attention to veterinary medicine, and to train professional talents, to increase efficiency for the cause, and to make a small contribution to society. If the wise and honorable officials and enthusiastic comrades in the country can give assistance, it is even more hoped.</p>

Before the preparations are completed, four buildings of the Laiyidu Jingdu Nunnery are temporarily borrowed, slightly repaired, and used as school buildings. It is also heard that after the school adds grades this year, in addition to the original faculty and staff being re-elected, Ji Chunpei and Yang Benjian, graduates of National Jinan University, have also been hired as teachers. As for the original faculty and staff who held concurrent positions outside the school, they have all been changed to full-time positions this year in accordance with the order of the Education Bureau.</p>

<p>The greatest joys in life lie within family relationships, not in indulging in feasts and entertainment.</p>

<h3 id="e113">A Brief Record of the Liangjiang Scouts Camping <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shoujian</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, famous for its basketball team, has been established for many years and is well-known far and wide. This year's graduates, feeling their studies were insufficient, established a summer program at the Wusong Fisheries School. On the first of the month, the scouts from the program camped at the public sports field outside the South Gate of Baoshan. The following is a jumbled account of the events.</p>
<p>Barefoot Immortals Running Through the Streets: Baoshan is located in a remote coastal area. Although close to Shanghai, its customs and traditions are still considered closed off. One afternoon, in the poor countryside of Baoshan, groups of women with bare legs were suddenly discovered, playing and frolicking. For a time, onlookers were amazed and exclaimed, "Where did these shameless Barefoot Immortals come from?"</p>
<p>Brisk Business for Watermelons and Soda: Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, with the scorching sun in the sky. As soon as the female scouts' tents were pitched, they felt covered in sweat and complained of the heat. As a result, the business of general soda and snack vendors boomed. A certain tea server at the sports field, originally a nearby farmer, carried several loads of watermelons to sell. Before long, they were all sold out, and his pockets were bulging, causing him to grin from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Gentle Breeze Opens a Field Meeting: At 8 PM, a camping field meeting was held. The residents of Baoshan City, young and old, came out in droves to watch. At the sound of a police whistle, the entire group lined up in a circle. Straw was burned in the center. In the flickering firelight, Coach Leng Xueqiao gave a brief report, saying, "Our school is honored to gather with the people of your area. However, due to insufficient prior preparation, the program performed at today's field meeting will be very simple and will fail to meet the high expectations of the guests. We hope you will forgive us. All those attending today are graduates of this year's Liangjiang School. As separation is imminent, we deeply hope that all students will display their best skills to embellish this rare event." Ms. Liu was then elected as chairwoman. Everyone held hands and walked around the circle, dancing and singing a song called "The Chinese Boy Scout Song." The singing was loud and clear, piercing through the clouds, expressing a spirit of excitement and enthusiasm. Next was the performance of various recreational activities, including several types of fan dances and excellent dances. The dancing was graceful and elegant, earning a lot of applause. A certain lady's Charleston dance, with its thick waist, wiggling and swaying feet, was quite amusing. Finally, everyone sang the Liangjiang School song together and dispersed, having enjoyed themselves to the fullest. By then, it was already ten o'clock.</p>

<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>In recent years, tragic accidents involving airplanes have often been reported in the newspapers. Although the world's science is progressing day by day, air travel is still not entirely safe, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>The dangers faced by airplanes in the sky are mostly due to sudden changes in weather or damage to the aircraft. However, in addition to these, according to historical aviation records, there are some unexpected dangers. These seem so interesting that I have named this article "Interesting Aerial Events."</p>
<p>For example, in early April of this year, a long-distance flight from Marseille, France, to Paris carried several passengers and some luggage. Among the luggage were several boxes of bees brought by someone. In the middle of the flight, for some reason, a swarm of bees from one of the boxes suddenly broke free and flew around the passengers and pilots, engaging in their aggressive activities. Imagine a small airplane with limited space. Now, with so many annoying little clowns, it was impossible to defend against them and impossible to avoid them. Wouldn't they be crying in agony? The pilot was especially miserable. He had to pay attention to the machinery and the safety of the passengers. How could his two hands move freely? He had no choice but to let the bees sting him freely. He was only freed from his suffering when he reached his destination, but his whole body was covered in wounds.</p>
<p>On another occasion, during the European war, a British plane crossed the English Channel to fly to Europe. There was only one passenger on board. In the middle of the flight, he suddenly went crazy, pulled out a pistol, aimed it at the pilot, and demanded that he jump out of the plane together. The pilot looked down and saw that the plane was still flying over the vast ocean. He frowned and came up with a plan. He politely said to the passenger, "Sir, please go down first. I will follow you." The madman fell for it, and the pilot saved his life.</p>
<p>On another occasion, a commercial airplane was flying when it was discovered that an important part of the machine had malfunctioned. For the safety of the passengers, the pilot landed the plane and carefully inspected it. He found that several rats were nesting near the part. He immediately chased them away and repaired the part before resuming the flight.</p>
<p>In another instance, in a certain part of Africa, an explorer took a plane and flew low over the plains to inspect the area. Suddenly, a lion pounced on the plane and damaged its wing. Also, Prince George of England recently traveled in India, using an airplane for transportation. Eagles often swooped down from the sky and damaged the plane's machinery. In a certain part of the United States, a pilot fell to his death after eagles attacked his plane. How can such unexpected dangers be fully prevented?</p>
<h3 id="e116">Emperor Hui of Ming and the Great Zha Mountain in Hang County <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Chang</p>
<p>With relics of Minister Cheng Ji's peach and the Emperor's Stone</p>
<p>During the Jingnan Campaign at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, unofficial histories recorded that Emperor Jianwen was tonsured as a monk and escaped through a tunnel, with his whereabouts unknown. The world regarded the emperor as having abdicated the throne, while the official history of the Ming Dynasty strongly refuted this, claiming that Jianwen and his palace had committed self-immolation and died for the country. However, according to local elders, Jianwen once resided at Dongming Temple on the Great Zha Mountain in the northern countryside of Hang County. Relics still remain and are clearly verifiable. This makes the accounts in the unofficial histories credible. The following is a record of Jianwen's residence at Great Zha Mountain and related relics, provided for researchers of Ming history to examine.</p>
<p>Great Zha Mountain is located at the intersection of Hang County, Deqing, and Wukang, fifty li outside the Hulin Gate of Hangzhou. It rises high above the clouds, with a circumference of over thirty li. Climbing to its peak, one can look south towards the Zhe River, where the water appears as a ribbon and the masts and sails are faintly visible. Looking north, one can see Wukang, with the houses on Mount Mogan clearly countable. From this, one can imagine the mountain's height. The mountain is covered in lush bamboo and trees, and the scenery is serene. On the peak of the mountain, there is a Taoist temple called Qingzhen Temple, inhabited by Taoist priests. Three li away from the temple, on the mountainside, there is a Buddhist temple called Dongming Temple, a place for monks to practice Zen. Both the temple and the Taoist temple were built during the Zhiyuan period of the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<p>During the Jingnan Campaign at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, it is said that Emperor Jianwen shaved his head and became a monk. The court official Cheng Ji dressed as a Taoist and fled with him, exiting through a tunnel in the palace and secretly heading towards Dusongguan in western Zhejiang (located seventy-five li northwest of Yu Hang County, a strategic pass in Jiangsu and Zhejiang). From Dusongguan, they went to the Great Zha Mountain in the northern countryside of Hang County and hid there. However, the two lived separately, with Jianwen residing at Dongming Temple and Cheng Ji practicing alchemy at Qingzhen Temple. From then on, the two rulers led an otherworldly life. Qingzhen Temple and Dongming Temple are directly above each other, and they could faintly see each other. After Jianwen and Cheng Ji hid there, every dawn, the two would come out of the mountain gate and look at each other from afar. Between the temple and the Taoist temple, there is a large, square rock, smooth and lustrous. On every new moon and full moon, the two would meet on the rock. This rock still exists today and is called the Emperor's Stone. Today, the mountain also has what is called Cheng Ji's Peach. The fruit is not very large and ripens in summer. When ripe, the pit and flesh separate, and the flesh near the pit is crimson. The taste is quite delicious and is a unique product of the mountain. It is said that this peach tree was planted by Cheng Ji, and its species has been passed down to this day, hence the name Cheng Ji's Peach.</p>
<p>In the side hall of Qingzhen Temple, there is an idol of Cheng Ji, dressed as a Taoist. In another room in the back hall of Dongming Temple, there is a statue of a monk, about thirty years old, wearing a robe, holding Buddhist beads, with lowered eyebrows and sitting in meditation. It is said that this statue is of Emperor Jianwen, who held the lofty position of power in the Ming Dynasty. Great Zha Mountain is only twelve li away from our town. The Qingzhen Temple holds its deity birthday celebration on the thirteenth day of the eighth month of each year, which is quite lively. I have visited twice and witnessed the above-mentioned relics.</p>

<p>Travels in India (75)</p>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the sixth, I attended the student arts and crafts fair at the Indian University with Dr. S.R.D. Sokda and his wife. The fair was in the auditorium, with over a thousand people in attendance, both male and female students. The electric fans were turned on. When guests arrived, ushers offered them a fresh flower and a sprig of pine on a tray. Soon after, they sprayed perfume on the seated guests with a perfume atomizer. This was an improvement over the colored water that people splashed on each other during the day. The perfume atomizer only sprayed a few drops on the head, whereas the colored water was splashed all over the body as a prank. After a while, the arts and crafts fair began. Boys and girls played music and sang. A strongman lifted iron rings weighing 115 pounds and rolled iron sheets with his hands as if rolling a rope. After rolling, he showed it to the seated guests. I saw that the iron sheet was about four-tenths of an inch thick and over an inch wide. No one could unbend the iron sheet that he had rolled. He could be said to be very brave. But his body was not very large or unusual. It was all due to practice. I left early because of the distance. Dr. Sokda and his wife went to their home. The moon was rising, and the shadows of the trees were swaying, so we had a night talk. Dr. Sokda and his wife are famous doctors who have been in England for a long time. They have a garden, so we discussed social medicine and hygiene. Most Indian priests are vegetarians and do not eat meat, as they consider meat to be unclean. According to them, they wished to use medical and hygiene laws to build a new village. The distribution of fields, houses, gardens, and all aspects of life, work, and even birth, upbringing, illness, old age, death, and burial, should all be governed by hygiene regulations. Property, equipment, livestock, and real estate that can be publicly owned should be publicly owned. Those that can be privately owned should be privately owned. All the households in the village, regardless of how many, should be guided and managed by doctors. They said that before a person is born, the mother's rights are important. After they are born, the doctor's rights should be important. The disposal of property, customs, and other matters should be based on hygiene. For example, the capitalist's slaves and workers go against hygiene rules. I asked, "If there is war and killing fills the fields, wouldn't that be even more against hygiene? What should be done?" They replied, "Medical professionals should unite the world's doctors with medical authority to abolish war, equally emphasizing maternal rights. Mothers give birth, and doctors protect. Then the world can be at peace." I said, "This reasoning is very good. In ancient China, the founders of the country were two doctors, Shennong and Huangdi. The founders of the Republic of China are also doctors, Sun Yat-sen. Only doctors know the importance of hygiene and protecting the people. Therefore, Chinese doctors should be both rulers and teachers. The plans of the ruler must include doctors. In a small scale, they can serve as the head of the new village. On a large scale, they can serve as the head of a country. This is the medical transformation of the great union. I hope that the world's doctors will unite and campaign for this." His wife, Ms. Gumlili, is very enthusiastic about social movements.</p>

<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Miss Ding instructed Qiu Zi, "I need to go out for a while. Let the old lady eat her supper and go to sleep first. Don't wait up for me." Qiu Zi agreed obediently.</p>
<p>Qiu Zi opened the door for them, and Mr. Lu and Miss Ding went out together. One walked in front, and the other followed behind. After they walked out of the gate, Qiu Zi saw that the one walking in front had stopped, and the one walking behind had caught up. Then they walked side by side.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Mr. Lu asked.</p>
<p>"I'd really like to play a little golf. Isn't the Dahua Golf Course nearby? Let's go to Dahua!" Miss Ding said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu was a novice at golf. Miss Ding had played a few times, but she wasn't very skilled either. So they played very slowly, and their scores were very high. When they reached the eighth hole, Miss Ding looked down from a high place and suddenly saw someone standing there, it was Mr. Li who had come to her house earlier, looking up at her.</p>
<p>She was a little embarrassed. Although she didn't want to see him, she felt that she had to greet him when she saw him, especially since he had come to her house earlier.</p>
<p>While she was hesitating, Mr. Li walked up.</p>
<p>"Miss Ding! What are you doing here? I came to your house earlier, but your maid said you had already gone out. I never expected to meet you here!" Mr. Li turned around, deliberately acting as if he had just seen Mr. Lu, and then continued, "Ah! Little Lu! Great! You came with her?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lu was disgusted by the sight of him. He replied with an arrogant expression, "I specially invited Miss Ding to come together."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Gold Bullion Enters a Sluggish State <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Falling Again by 3 Taels and 7 Mace</p>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in gold bullion prices continued for the fifth day. However, the market was calm, with a total turnover of only 4.5 taels. The result was another drop of more than 3 taels, and market sentiment seemed to be weak. The demand and supply within the market were inconsistent, but there were no large transactions. The price fell as soon as trading opened. It is heard that the rise in silver prices has stimulated the market and that there may be an equalization of cash internationally, as there have been reports of shipments from England to New York. The foreign exchange market seems stable going forward, and the price of spot transactions has also increased slightly, so the market has become more moderate and peaceful. The future market may strengthen and then decline again, likely due to active selling. However, it was Wednesday, and the bill market was sluggish.</p>
<p>Opening Lower in the Morning</p>
<p>In the morning, the September opening price dropped by 2 taels and 7 mace to 737 taels. Big bars rose by 1/16, the price of silver rose by 1/8, private telegrams rose by 3/16, and official telegrams rose by 1/4. European markets were also oversupplied, and there were many sellers on the trading floor. The price then fell to 35.5 taels, immediately rebounding by a tael or so. This was because firms like Cui Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Cheng, and Wu Pin were all buying. However, the price fluctuated by only a tael or so. British gold and Zhengjin Gold, Mitsui, and others all ate 13125 until the announcement of British gold at 37 taels and 2 mace. License holders remained the same. Soon after, Yuan Cheng Yong, Hong Li, Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Tai Chang, and others sold, slightly suppressing the price by a tael. Approaching 10 o'clock, the price was 36 taels and 1 mace.</p>
<p>Brief Optimism</p>
<p>At that time, Hua Bi and others bought November British gold at 25, and Taiwan bought October Japanese gold at 1 tael, 6 mace, and 0.0375. Yuan Heng, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, and Wu Mou and others also dragged prices up. Therefore, after 10:30, the market became more favorable, as banks were buying British gold at 0.1875 to 0.25, and the market seemed optimistic. The price jumped by 3 taels, retreating only by a few mace. After 11:45, the price surged to 40 taels. There were very few transactions at this price. The price of 39 taels and 8 mace was changed to 40 taels. In an instant, the prices of near-term and far-term Indian exchange rates rose and fell by only one anna. Yuan Cheng and Wu Pin were selling, causing the price to fall back to 39 taels. At the midday close, the revealed price was still calculated at 790 taels and 2 mace, with a squeeze of 54 to 50 taels and some odd.</p>
<p>Market Participants Sell Off</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 39 taels and 6 mace, followed by 9 taels and 7 mace. The market was still stable, but Zhi Feng Yong, Tong Tai Chang, and others came to unload their holdings, causing market sentiment to decline and the price to drop by 2 taels to below 38 taels. After 3 o'clock, the decline became more pronounced, especially as the Indian exchange rate reported a large increase of 3 annas. Major players such as Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Tong Fu, and various firms all sold, making it difficult for the price to stabilize. The price then depreciated by a tael or so, with only a few mace of fluctuation in between. At the 4:30 closing, the price was 36 taels, a further drop of 3 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous day. After the closing, the price rose again to above 36 taels. The day's highest price was 40 taels, and the lowest price was 35.5 taels, a difference of 4.5 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Tianjin Stomach Improves</p>
<p>The morning market price for Wu Pin was 37 taels, the midday closing price was 9 taels and 3 mace, the afternoon price was 8 taels and 8 mace, and the closing price was 6 taels and 5 mace. The revealed price was calculated with a squeeze of 54 taels. The book price was 37 taels to 39 taels, with a premium of 37 taels. In the afternoon, the premium was 34 taels. As for the spot red bars, the Tianjin "stomach" (demand) was still strong. Ying Feng Heng and Da Feng Heng sold more than 2,000 taels to the Tianjin gang, and Ying Feng Heng also bought 1,000 taels, which were sold by fellow merchants. The price increased by 11 taels and 7.5 mace compared to the gold bullion price, continuing to be stronger than the previous day.</p>
<p>Guangdong Gang Remains Watchful</p>

<p>Yarn Market Re-enters a Sluggish Path</p>
<p>The yarn market is gradually moving towards a sluggish path, and the situation is weakening. The decline in raw materials has loosened the foundation of the yarn market, and the widespread flooding is becoming increasingly serious. Current yarn sales may be hit, so business in all directions is exceptionally quiet. Some merchants still have no intention of short selling, so the market is relatively soft. However, buyers remain calm and unmoved. However, the global cotton industry is very pessimistic, and the pressure is particularly great. Most are holding a wait-and-see attitude. If the overseas situation does not improve, the future of the yarn market may be bleak.</p>
<p>Man-Made Yarn Prices Drop by 1 Tael</p>
<p>The opening price of man-made yarn on the exchange was still flat in the morning. Due to the slight increase in foreign cotton, the market atmosphere in the trading floor was relaxed, and prices fell by 3.6 mace. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot sales were quiet, and raw cotton fell again. Prices for each month fell by 7.8 mace to 1 tael and 1 mace. The total transaction volume was 19,700 bales. Chang Feng sold 1,300 bales, Yi Chang sold 900 bales, Ji Feng sold 700 bales, and Geng Feng sold 650 bales. Ming De bought 1,200 bales, Li Chang bought 600 bales, De Ji bought 750 bales, Yi Chang bought 800 bales, and He Shen bought 550 bales. The closing prices of man-made yarn are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Man-Made Yarn Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Inventory</p>

<p>October, 159.4, Down 1.0, 95,100, January, 161.1, Down 1.3, 27,050</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Clear, Prices Weak</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are increasingly sluggish. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 800 bales throughout the day, and fellow traders bought 200 bales. Clearance was slightly weak. Among the customer gangs, 80 bales were imported to the mainland, 319 bales to Yunnan, 120 bales to Tianjin, 45 bales to Qingdao, 160 bales to Sichuan, and 60 bales to miscellaneous gangs, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Cotton Market Ultimately Difficult to Improve <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Market Rises in the Morning, Falls in the Afternoon, But the Trend is Still Firm</p>
<p>The overseas cotton market was calm, and the decline was slightly curbed. The floods in various places are still severe, and cotton fields have suffered considerable damage, so the mainland gangs tend to be bullish. Therefore, the market once rose slightly. However, the global cotton market is extremely pessimistic. Private estimates of American cotton are more than 14 million bales. Based on past consumption, the future of the cotton market is still difficult to stabilize, so large players are selling heavily, and spot cotton transactions at various factories are stagnant, it is said.</p>
<p>Han-Standard Cotton Prices Fall Back by 2-3 Mace</p>
<p>The opening price of Han-standard cotton on the exchange in the morning was because American cotton was flat and the weather was hot and muggy, with fears of a major storm. Therefore, retail investors bought, and prices for each month rose by 0.5 fen to 1.5 qian. The afternoon opening price was a slight drop due to rain. For the second and third sessions, the weather suddenly cleared, and a sudden decline began, with prices for each month falling by 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total transaction volume was 74,600 dan. Tian Long sold 2,400 dan, Yuan Da sold 3,200 dan, De Ji sold 2,200 dan, Xin Feng sold 2,600 dan, and Geng Feng sold 1,900 dan. Ji Feng bought 2,500 dan, Shen Chang bought 3,100 dan, and Xin Heng bought 4,200 dan. The closing prices of Han-standard cotton are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Transactions Unheard Of</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are sluggish. The source is estimated to be 1,900 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>American Cotton Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed, pending the next government report. It was weak at first due to good harvests, and then strong due to short covering. Futures rose by 1-3 pound sounds. Spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 25-6 points. Spot prices fell by 14 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton situation was calm and strong. Pingle and Bairoxi fell by 1 rupee. Omla fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th telegraph):</p>

<p>Grain Prices Mostly Rise, Some Fall in the Heshia Rice Market</p>
<p>South Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fengji Wharf arrived with Tongli No. 3, Nangang No. 6, Pinghu No. 4, Qingjiao No. 4, and Liantang No. 1. There was a slight amount of Pu Cun. Transactions in urban and rural areas improved. Changsu machine-milled japonica and Tongli white japonica sold firmly at 2-3 jiao. The attitude of buyers is that as the Beginning of Autumn is approaching, prices will inevitably increase. The source of early and late rice is slightly less. Store supplies are abundant, and prices are expensive at 3-4 jiao. Bianyin Yuan and Shanghai foreign pointed goods are scarce and slightly higher. Foreign rice arrived yesterday in one round. The way to go on this street is limited. The Wuhan gang is very active in handling it, so the price suddenly increased. Pudong new japonica continues to arrive in nearly 100 dan, and the price remains at the original level.</p>
<p>New Zha</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many sources in the back streets, and sales became more active. Thick japonica goods arrived in small quantities, and prices suddenly increased by 2 jiao. The old stock in Zhongguan also increased by 3 jiao. According to letters from the mainland, the market for brown japonica has risen. As the Beginning of Autumn Festival has arrived, people are active, and early and late arrivals are sold equally well, with a good increase of 3 jiao. The way to go for Shanghai pointed customer gangs and this street is quite refreshing, with the opening falling by nearly a jiao. Foreign pointed goods poured in, and prices did not rise or fall. Glutinous rice and wine shops still need rice loads, and prices rose by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Flour Manufacturers Have Another Round of Selling <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>All Monthly Contracts Show Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a declining trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by another 0.2-0.5 jiao. The manufacturers also set up two ships of No. 3 Red Wheat from Citibank, which were in bulk and without bags, and the price was only 4 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen (the market price was 4 taels, 1 qian, and 4 fen). Therefore, they sold a huge amount of long-term contracts again. Fu and Fu families reached more than 600,000 bags. Although the Yangtze River gangs in the mainland also bought a large quantity, the momentum at that time was not as strong as the factory's sales, so prices gradually fell. We will see how actual sales go in the future to determine the final outcome. As a result, this month was down 0.25 li from the previous day, September and October were down 0.75 li, November and December were down 0.0125 fen, and January was down 0.01 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wheat Market Futures Particularly Weak <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Wheat Continues to Set Up About 7,000 Tons</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was generally flat and weak. Because there were many bulls supporting it, the fluctuation was small this month. Long-term contracts were again transacted by market experts in foreign wheat, about 7,000 tons, so they were sold as much as possible. The factory set out a lot of contracts. The buyers also belonged to market experts, such as Tailun who received the most. However, because foreign wheat is being set up in batches, they are all real chips, and people can't help but feel weak. As a result, this month remained unchanged, September was down 0.01 fen, October was down 0.02 fen, November was down 0.04 fen, and December was down 0.03 fen. The current wheat is still stable, and the factory supplies are also good. It is said that more than 5,000 bags of wheat from Hengjing, Kunshan, Zhitang, Penglai, Shuangfeng, Taicang, Jiading, and Zhenjiang were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>

<p>Coarse Yellow Silk and Indian Sales Show No Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market at foreign firms in this port continued to be sluggish. The telegrams sent by overseas yellow and white factories did not improve. Coarse silk and Indian sales showed no improvement. The market was bleak. Only Gao Pei and others imported 18 bales of yellow coarse silk, and the price was still firm, it is said.</p>

<p>Among the 48 silk factories in Wuxi, 80% have started production. However, the spring and summer cocoon harvests this year were both extremely poor. Each type of factory sent personnel to Shanghai to purchase Anhui cocoons to make up for the shortage. Therefore, Anhui cocoons have been frequently transported recently. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train had another 200 pieces of Anhui dried cocoons, which were shipped to Wuxi.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the tea market in foreign firms in this port, most British firms began to search for Gaozhuang fine eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Transactions were quite lively. Among them, the core-extracted goods opened at 245 taels, and the market price increased by 10-20 taels. The other large-gang shrimp eyes and phoenix eyebrows also generally looked up to increase prices. The green tea market is becoming more and more solid. However, Qimen black tea has been quite scarce recently. Yesterday, Tianyu Foreign Firm bought more than 200 boxes, with sale prices ranging from 38 taels to 68 taels, a drop of more than 10 taels compared to the previous market. The market situation has not improved, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Piece Goods <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Cloth, Woolen Cloth Customer Sales Have Started</p>
<p>The weather has been hot recently, and woolen cloth wholesale transactions have stopped. Retail sales in stores are also very sluggish. Heavy fabrics such as overcoat wool, melton, camel down, and all kinds of sea tiger leopard skin gun wool have been launched one after another. The selling price has increased sharply by 20-30% compared with last winter. Yesterday, most of the customer gangs had already asked for samples and were preparing to purchase them. The Tianjin and Sichuan gangs have already completed dozens of boxes of transactions for yarn and wool overcoats and ordinary melton, but they are all written orders with a deadline for delivery. Except for melton, other goods that have been delivered at the wharf can be said to be rare. Tianxiang melton is shouting for 2 taels and 2 qian, Ningfeng Zheng's number is 2 taels and 4 qian, the deputy number is 2 taels and 2.5 qian, and the second number is 2 taels and 1.5 qian. Deji Shangtiantai and Gongping Tongquetai are both 2 taels and 8 qian. Hongsheng overcoat wool is 2 taels and 8.5 qian, and Lixing rotten paste wool is 1 tael and 3 qian net price.</p>

<p>Orchid Seeds Fall by 5 Taels</p>
<p>This batch of Zhangzhou lychees had a total of 400-odd boxes, of which only one or two tenths were numbered goods, so the opening price tended to rise again. A batch opened by Dalaihao yesterday rose compared to the previous batch of orchid branches</p>
<h3 id="e138">Metals: No New Developments in the Entire City <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's metal market conditions showed no significant progress from any of the trading guilds. As a result, the overall trend in the city remained stagnant. Some goods saw prices surge due to supply shortages, while others experienced a decline due to oversupply. The main items are detailed below:</p>
<p>Sixty-Pound Tinplate Massively Out of Stock: Sixty-pound tinplate is a crucial raw material for can factories. Recently, the market has experienced a severe shortage, and the efforts of various trading guilds to import more are still underway. This has fueled market speculation and soaring prices, with each box reaching fifty taels, a sharp increase of six and a half taels compared to the previous price. Considering the current environment, it is feared that the price trend may continue to rise.</p>
<p>French Wire Nails Enter a State of Decline: After the cessation of eastern goods arriving in Shanghai, the local market initially showed signs of progress for French wire nails. However, sales from customer trading guilds have been affected by warfare, banditry, floods, and communist disturbances, leading to a significant drop in demand. Despite the efforts of various firms to promote sales, they have been unable to reverse the situation. Furthermore, local factories are producing large quantities of nails, causing the entire city to fall into a state of decline. Although the current asking price is only eight taels and seven mace and five candareens, there are still no buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Wang Rongbao Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Paid a Formal Visit to the Minister of Foreign Affairs This Morning</p>
<p>The Responsibility for the Korean Incident Lies Entirely with Japan</p>
<p>No Word Yet of a Joint Investigation</p>
<p>Wang Rongbao, the Minister to Japan, arrived in Shanghai around 5 PM yesterday on the Taikoo Company's ship Tongzhou from Tianjin. He was accompanied by his staff member, Ren Jiafeng. Due to the fatigue of the journey, he rested in Shanghai overnight and is scheduled to take the express train to Beijing this morning to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the truth of the tragic anti-Chinese case in Korea, discuss response measures, and determine negotiation strategies. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. Wang at his lodging yesterday. According to him, he was instructed by the Ministry to go to Pyongyang, Incheon, Seoul, and other places to investigate the truth of the Korean incident. The investigation results have been compiled into a complete written report, which has been presented to the Ministry as a basis for negotiation. As for his personal opinions and a brief overview of the Korean incident investigation, he has already detailed them in his previous talks with the press in Liaoning and Tianjin, so he will not repeat them here. In short, this Korean incident was a simultaneous anti-Chinese riot in various parts of Korea. Pyongyang suffered the most severe losses. The total material losses are estimated at 2.43 million Japanese yen, equivalent to about 5 million Chinese yuan. The entire Korean peninsula is under Japanese influence. The Japanese side neither prevented the incident beforehand nor provided protection afterward, so the responsibility cannot be shirked in any way. There has been no word of a joint Chinese-Japanese investigation. He met with Deputy Commander Zhang in Pyongyang and reported everything. He left Tianjin one day and took the Tongzhou ship south, spending five days on the ship. The weather was hot, and he was sweating profusely, making the journey extremely uncomfortable. He will rest here tonight (last night) and go to Beijing tomorrow morning (today) to meet with Foreign Minister Wang in person and report in detail. As for how long he will stay in Beijing and whether he will return to his post, he will completely obey the Central Government's orders. When he was in Korea, many intellectuals from the Korean community came to request an audience and expressed that the Korean incident was not the original intention of the Korean people and asked for forgiveness, expressing extreme remorse. The Japanese authorities also repeatedly stated and guaranteed that such incidents would not happen again. He responded that this was not a personal matter but a matter for the entire Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Another report states that the only reason the Japanese side considers a joint Chinese-Japanese investigation of the Korean incident to be unfavorable is that a joint investigation would naturally lead to the issue of responsibility. Responsibility would require compensation for losses. The Japanese side has repeatedly expressed its willingness to provide full compensation but does not want to bear the name of compensation, otherwise, the current cabinet would not be able to stand, and the Seiyukai party would take its place. However, our side will naturally insist on the three principles of apology, guarantee, and compensation in the negotiation of the Korean incident.</p>
<p>Attention from All Sectors</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Theory of Extending Concessions <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Newspapers Have Something to Say</p>
<p>All Sectors Denounce it as Fabrication</p>
<p>The Authorities Consider it a Rumor</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of ignorant merchants in Western Shanghai recklessly requesting the extension of concessions, this newspaper has already reprinted the report from the Shanghai Evening Post in yesterday's newspaper to alert people in Shanghai. However, the Shanghai Evening Post again published the Bureau of Public Roads' reply to the merchants' letter yesterday, still not admitting it was fabricated. The reporter earnestly hopes that merchants in Western Shanghai should immediately make a statement on their own initiative, the General Chamber of Commerce should send someone to investigate the truth as soon as possible, the municipal authorities should actively promote municipal construction, and the diplomatic authorities should make efforts to recover the concessions. Then, this kind of rumor will naturally disappear without being refuted. The various pieces of information obtained yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<p>The wording of the Bureau of Public Roads' reply: According to the report in the Shanghai Evening Post, the Bureau of Public Roads replied to the merchants yesterday (4th), saying that the Bureau of Public Roads is well aware that the situation of the various roads mentioned is unsatisfactory, but until an agreement has been reached with the Shanghai Municipal Government on the issue of roads outside the concessions, the Bureau cannot take any action. According to a member of the Bureau of Public Roads, the merchants of Western Shanghai, or anyone else, believe that the Bureau of Public Roads can take over the roads outside the concessions without the full consent of the Chinese authorities, which is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Third District Party Department: The Third District Party Department issued a declaration yesterday, stating, "Having read the newspaper report that there are unconscionable Chinese people willing to be foreign slaves, requesting the Bureau of Public Roads to extend the concessions and lay asphalt roads, add street lights, and lay streetcars in the three places of Zhujia Gua, Wangjialou, and Shengjiaqiao in Western Shanghai, the establishment of concessions is only for foreign merchants to live in important commercial ports, sovereignty and all administration originally belonged to our country. Later, due to the ignorance of officials in the Qing Dynasty, they abandoned the right to manage, so foreigners took the opportunity to invade, creating today's situation. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the foresighted and enlightened leader of our party, traveled around to promote and publicize, and the people of the whole country suddenly realized and unanimously worked hard for the movement to recover the concessions. After the National Revolutionary Army took an oath to launch the Northern Expedition and unified the country, it has successively recovered the British and Belgian concessions in Hankou, Zhenjiang, Xiamen, Tianjin, and other places. Our party is taking a further step and actively seeking to recover the concessions in all parts of the country. In this unanimous national effort to abolish consular jurisdiction and recover the concessions, the strange thing of ignorant citizens of China who are unconscionable are requesting the extension of the concessions has occurred. There is no definite evidence, and this news comes from the Shanghai Evening Post, which is run by American imperialists, and it is self-evident that it is intentionally fabricated. It is hoped that our compatriots across the country will pay attention and correct it together. In addition to the people of Western Shanghai making an automatic clarification, they should also be responsible for reporting it. In addition to submitting a letter to the superior government to pay attention to the municipal construction in Western Shanghai and a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find out the truth as soon as possible, this association hereby makes a solemn declaration.</p>
<p>Citizens Correcting Misconceptions: Citizens Zhou Lianze, Yang Chichan, Yu Xiufang, Li Guohua, Yao Genhuo, Guo Shanqing, Qian Xiuzhai, Jin Xiaodong, Xu Guoying, Liao Changguang, Zheng Jiyu, Ye Nai, Xie Jinrong, Xia Renqi, Hang Wujiu, Xu Ziqing, and more than sixty others, in view of the fact that yesterday's Shen Bao local news column contained a piece entitled "Strange! Chinese People Request the Extension of Concessions," the fact is that the Shanghai Evening Post reported that merchants in Zhujiaqiao, Wangjialou, and Shengjiaqiao in Western Shanghai jointly requested the Bureau of Public Roads to extend the concessions and start construction projects such as roads, street lights, and tap water in the three places to meet the needs of the residents there. They believe that the Shanghai Evening Post fabricated the facts and issued a declaration to correct them. The full text is recorded below: The National News Agency forwarded to various newspapers for the public to read: At a time when the citizens of the whole country are unanimously demanding the recovery of concessions from various countries, the Shanghai Evening Post, run by American imperialists in Shanghai, actually published news that merchants in Zhujiaqiao, Wangjialou, Shengjiaqiao, and other three places in Western Shanghai jointly requested the Bureau of Public Roads to extend the concessions. The newspaper gave this a large headline, saying it with certainty, as if it were true, as if there were people who wanted the concessions to continue to exist, even to expand their scope, and who were willing to bow their heads under the rule of American imperialism and live the life of subjugated slaves. This can be described as farcical and absurd to the extreme. Although the Chinese national character has always been known for peace, and peace is spoken of to the world everywhere, since the revolution to this day, the sinister face and poisonous heart of imperialism have been thoroughly understood, and the movement for national equality has been actively engaged in. The power of concession rule, which should not exist within our territory, should be recovered as soon as possible, and a completely autonomous and independent country should be achieved. This has become the unanimous demand of the whole country, and although this demand has not been fully achieved, it is only a matter of time. However, we can be sure that there are no people who are so willing to betray their country and lose their minds as to have such an absurd and unparalleled act. It is obvious that the Shanghai Evening Post fabricated the facts, trying to extend the life of the concessions and realize its policy in the Far East. Its despicable psychology of struggling to survive when it is at the end of its rope is even more exposed. Fellow merchants in the three places of Zhujiaqiao and others in Western Shanghai should know that if they think that the construction of all road administration, public security, and other undertakings in various places in Western Shanghai is urgent and cannot be delayed, they can ask the municipal authorities to take full responsibility for it. As for what is published in the Shanghai Evening Post, which is close to insulting, they should take the initiative to make a statement, so that it will not be spread abroad, ridiculed by the world, bring shame to the whole body, and be a great obstacle to the recovery of the concessions. On the one hand, it is also to expose the conspiracies of American imperialism. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as the leading organization of the merchants of the whole city, should immediately send someone to thoroughly investigate the truth of the matter and announce it to the citizens, so that the public will not be misled by false statements. It is also hoped that the diplomatic authorities will actively work hard to recover the concessions, and the problems of road construction beyond the concessions and public security and municipal administration will be solved easily, so that the imperialists will have no way to covet it and will only speed up their own demise. The country is in a difficult situation, and rumors are alarming. It is hoped that everyone will rise up to correct them. This is a declaration, and we hope you will all be aware of it.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Believes it is a Rumor: The news that the Shanghai Evening Post previously reported that merchants in Caojiadu and Shengjiaqiao in Western Shanghai jointly requested the Bureau of Public Roads to extend the concessions is particularly shocking. A reporter from the New Voice Society visited Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, yesterday to ask whether the news was true or contained poisonous propaganda. He replied that the municipal government also only saw the news in the newspaper and had not received any reports from other sources. At the same time, he believed that the news was an extremely unconscious act, because at a time when the municipal government is working hard to negotiate the construction of roads beyond the concessions and when the Chinese people are vigorously advocating the recovery of the concessions, even if the merchants are greedy for profit and forget their righteousness, they would never dare to do such a great injustice to the world and do something that sells out the country for glory. Even on the foreign side, if they have a little common sense, they would not violate public reason and act rashly. Moreover, judging from the current situation, what foreigners are urgently planning for themselves is a kind of conservatism, because what foreigners are most afraid of and pay attention to now is our country's movement to recover the concessions, fearing that the deep-rooted concession rights that have been obtained will be eradicated at once. In short, what foreigners are now struggling to maintain is their acquired rights, and there is no mention of the word "extension" at all. To reiterate in regard to the merchants' request to extend the concessions, I ask in what name, what qualifications, and in what way can a group of merchants rashly do this? Therefore, we can only regard this propaganda as meddling for no reason and too ignorant. In terms of its content, it is not worth laughing at.</p>
<p>Today</p>
<h3 id="e162">Registration Deadline for Japanese Goods <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Overdue goods will be treated as smuggled goods.</p>
<p>All confiscated goods will be confiscated.</p>
<p>The registration of Japanese goods by the Anti-Japanese and Aid-Korea Committee and the registration of Japanese goods in member stores by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will both end today. In the past two days, people who went to the two associations to obtain registration forms almost broke down the door. It is reported that the deadline for registration was decided by the executive committee of the Anti-Japanese Association and the temporary meeting of members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and there will be no further extensions. Currently, registration is only today, and goods will be treated as smuggled goods after the deadline, and all confiscated goods will be confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Shipping News in the Midst of the Boycott <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Soybeans and Sorghum Converted to Chinese Ships: A large amount of soybeans and sorghum bean cakes in Eastern Provinces are transported to foreign countries and southern Chinese ports every year, and about eight-tenths of them are carried by Japanese ships. Dalian Steamship Company has even built eight special ships this year, preparing to sail from Andong Yingkou, Dalian to southern Chinese ports and other ports, and there is no hope for Chinese ships to get involved. Since the boycott began, Dalian merchants have also decided not to use Japanese ships to transport goods. They have been sending telegrams to Shanghai for several days, asking Shanghai's shipping bureaus to send more Chinese ships to Dalian to carry miscellaneous grains to Shantou, Xiamen, and other places. China Merchants Bureau has already transferred two ships to go, and Zhengji Zhaoxing and others have also sent a large number of ships to carry them. The cargo that was carried by Japanese ships has been completely unloaded.</p>
<p>Chinese People Going to Japan Change to Foreign Ships: There is only one Japanese company, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), on the Shanghai-Japan route, which has special liner services, so NYK has a monopoly on the transportation of Japanese goods and Chinese people going to Japan. According to NYK, there are eight NYK ships on the China-Japan route, which regularly travel between Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, and Yokohama. Chinese passengers account for 70-80% of the passengers. Since the boycott began, according to NYK, Chinese people have completely disappeared from the first-class cabins of the company's ships. Even the third-class passengers, who used to travel in groups of dozens, now only have a few. It is said that recently, Chinese people have changed to British and American mail ships.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods in All Warehouses Completely Cleared Out: Before the boycott, the warehouses at the docks of Japanese ships were all full of goods, because after the price of gold rose, those who had ordered goods were unwilling to take delivery. Since the boycott began, Japanese goods stored in the warehouses have been emptied in a week. During the rush to load, NYK alone received 50,000 taels of warehouse rent per day (usually only a little less than 1,000 taels). Recently, there are no Japanese goods in the warehouses of Japanese merchants, and Chinese merchants in Shanghai who have ordered Japanese goods but have not yet been shipped have now cancelled their orders. In recent days, the amount of goods imported from Japan to Shanghai has been greatly reduced. According to Japanese shipping companies, Japanese exporters, in view of the intensity of boycotts in various places, even if they have goods to ship to Shanghai, it is difficult to ship them to various places for sale, so they plan to suspend loading in August and September.</p>
<p>Announcement by the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<h3 id="e164">Procedures for Inspecting Japanese Goods <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Inspectors Wear Badges</p>
<p>Those without badges are imposters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-Korea Committee issued its ninth announcement yesterday, stating, "Our association's cargo inspection work has been implemented for many days. We are now afraid that someone will use our association's name to swindle and deceive, so we are specifically announcing the procedures for cargo inspection by the inspectors of the Inspection Section of our association and the addresses of the inspection offices in each district for public inspection. (1) All inspectors of our association wear temporary badges of our association, indicating their name and number, and affixed with the seal of our association (formal badges will be issued in the future and photos will be attached to prevent impersonation). (2) Inspectors of our association are led by a captain during working hours. (3) When our association seizes Japanese goods, it will issue a receipt to the owner of the goods, with the seal of our association and the signature or seal of the director and deputy director and inspectors of each district inspection office. (4) The addresses of the inspection offices in each district of our association are listed below: (A) Zhabei District Inspection Office, No. 100 Xibaoxing Lane, Baoshan Road West; (B) Nanshi District Inspection Office, Pharmaceutical Industry Union inside Dadongmen; (C) Pudong District Inspection District, inside the British-American Tobacco Company's Workers' Children's School, Lan Nidu, Pudong; (D) Huxi Inspection Office, Caojiadu Wujiaochang, No. 9 Bailinan Branch Road. If there are any persons who lack the above procedures or are not dispatched by the above inspection offices and swindle and deceive in the name of the association, all merchants are allowed to immediately take them to the Public Security Bureau for detention in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Suggestions from Various Industries</p>
<h3 id="e165">Collecting Industrial Funds <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Raw Materials and Necessities from Japan are Not Boycotted</p>
<p>10% of funds are collected to set up factories.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry, Silk Satin Industry, Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry, New Drug Industry, Cotton Number Industry, Knitting Industry, North-South Goods Exchange Industry, and more than 30 other trade associations jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the collection of industrial funds for raw materials and necessities from Japan to prepare for the establishment of factories in order to thoroughly oppose Japan. It reads, "We hereby inform you that this time, the Japanese used Korean people to slaughter overseas Chinese in the Wanbaoshan case, causing heavy casualties. The cruel situation is unprecedented. Compatriots all over the country are deeply aware of the danger of the extinction of the nation and are determined to break the pot and sink the boat and never engage in economic relations with Japan, vowing to fight to the death. If everyone is of one mind and perseveres to the end, the Japanese will eventually soften and beg for mercy. However, our country's industry has always been backward, and its factories are only in their infancy. The raw materials and daily necessities they need, such as fine yarn, coarse yarn, match stems, newspapers, sulfur, pine smoke, rayon, sugar, Japanese coal, cloth, cement, etc., are mostly supplied by other countries, and especially by our eastern neighbor. Now that the whole country is unanimously opposing Japan, if these raw materials and daily necessities are also included in the boycott, then the few factories that we have will inevitably stop production, and the daily necessities used by the people of the country will be cut off. The losses suffered by factory owners have already been huge, and the shortage of livelihood materials for the people has been put aside for the moment. The loss of jobs by workers is enough to create a great terror in society. The actual effect of opposing Japan is still unknown, and the impact on ourselves has already been presented before us. A complete and thorough boycott is a suicidal policy. However, in the world, advantages and disadvantages go hand in hand. If we want the advantages to outweigh the disadvantages, we can only adopt a flexible approach. Before we are able to fully supply ourselves with these raw materials and necessities, we will temporarily not boycott them. However, on the part of those who purchase and transport them, we will collect an industrial fund equal to 10% of the value before allowing them to pass. Otherwise, if they are detained, they should be dealt with in accordance with the regulations. This fund is to be used exclusively for the establishment of this industry, and it should be properly kept by the representatives of the various industries together with your association. It is not allowed to be used until a considerable amount has been collected to establish the industry. After five years, there will be factories everywhere, and the goods needed will be more than enough to supply ourselves. At that time, when we talk about opposing Japan, there is no need to point and wait for the effect to be seen. Our associations are in the business community and are closely concerned. We have something to say and cannot remain silent. We dare to jointly request your association to investigate the situation, review it and implement it. The future of anti-Japan will be greatly benefited.</p>

<p>Mr. Chiang Tsun-Kwei, an important figure in military and political circles, passed away at 1:50 PM yesterday at his residence at No. 23 Avenue Safoe, French Concession. Details of his illness and a biography of Mr. Chiang are presented below:</p>
<h3 id="e171">Portrait of Mr. Chiang Tsun-Kwei <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Brief Biography: Chiang, courtesy name Boqi, was 50 years old and a native of Zhuji, Zhejiang Province. He was the son of the renowned Zhejiang literary figure, Mr. Chiang Kwan-Yun. He studied at the Qiushi Academy in Hangzhou from a young age. At the age of 22, he went to Japan to study, entering the Military Academy. He graduated from the first class in the Cavalry Department. He and Chiang Fang-Chen were known as the "Two Chiangs of Zhejiang." After returning to China, he served in the Qing army. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as Military Governor of the Guangdong and Zhejiang armies, a member of the Political Conference, and a senator in the Senate. In 1920, he entered the Guangdong military government and served as Deputy Chief of Staff. In 1923, when Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong, he again served as Deputy Minister of the Military Affairs Department. In 1926, after the Northern Expedition secured Shanghai, he was appointed Chairman of the Shanghai Political Branch, concurrently serving on the Zhejiang Provincial Committee, as Senior Advisor to the Commander-in-Chief, and as a member of the Relief Committee. He then came to Shanghai to recuperate, residing at No. 23 Avenue Safoe, French Concession. He spent his days chanting scriptures and assisting in all charitable endeavors, without concerning himself with current affairs.</p>
<p>Death: Mr. Chiang, due to practicing equestrian shooting, suffered from stomach ailments that recurred periodically. After being stimulated last year, he contracted heart disease. His condition suddenly worsened on the fourth day of the fifth lunar month this year, with constant vomiting, consuming only thin porridge. He consulted Dr. Lu Zhong'an, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, with no improvement. On the 23rd of last month, he entered the Sino-Western Sanitarium on Xipushi Road, consulting Dr. Langban, a Western doctor, also without success. On the 1st of this month, his condition suddenly changed. That afternoon, he was moved back to his residence. At 10 AM on the 2nd, he briefly stopped breathing, but recovered at 3 PM. His family was overjoyed, but he was delirious, repeatedly asking for cold drinks, which his family dared not give him. He passed away at 1:50 PM yesterday afternoon, leaving behind two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Yimen, is 18 years old, and the second son, Shuanglong, is four years old. The eldest daughter, Dongrong, and the second daughter, Donghua, are both studying at Fudan Vocational High School, except for Shuanglong. Mr. Chiang's remains are scheduled to be placed in a coffin at his residence tomorrow.</p>

<p>Local Taiwanese Compatriots Preparing Memorial Service</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Wei-Shui, a leader of the Taiwanese revolution, suddenly died of typhoid fever at the Taipei Hospital yesterday morning. All who heard the news were overcome with grief. Mr. Chiang was a key member of the Taiwanese People's Party. For decades, he tirelessly led the Taiwanese people's liberation movement. He pursued the revolution without fear of violence, incurring the Japanese authorities' animosity. He was arrested and detained countless times. In modern Taiwanese revolutionary history, Mr. Chiang participated in almost every event. In 1919, Mr. Chiang initiated the organization of liberation groups and the Taiwan Cultural Association in Taiwan, disregarding personal safety and openly resisting the Japanese's various unreasonable oppressions, while publicizing the Japanese's political, economic, and cultural invasion schemes abroad. He was a pioneer for the passionate young people of Taiwan. His sudden passing is a great misfortune for the oppressed peoples of East Asia. Upon receiving the news yesterday, local Taiwanese compatriots convened an emergency meeting that evening to prepare for a memorial service to be held in Shanghai soon, and a preparatory office was established at the Overseas Chinese Hospital at Bowling Green Road.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Successful Conclusion of Shaanxi Disaster Relief <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Relief Funds Revenue and Expenditure Audited and Certified by Accountants</p>
<p>Details of Distribution Reported to Shanghai by Zhu Qinglan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Urgent Disaster Relief Committee for Shaanxi, which had been operating for two and a half months, collected over 431,000 yuan in relief funds, in addition to numerous relief goods not included in the amount. All funds and goods were successively transported to Xi'an and handed over to Zhu Qinglan, head of the North China Philanthropic Federation, for personal distribution. The committee then concluded its affairs, gathered all donation lists, account books, and remittance receipts, and entrusted accountant Xu Yongzuo to prepare a report to be submitted to the committee. The report included a statement from the accountant certifying that the attached revenue and expenditure statement was accurately prepared based on the records and that the revenue and expenditure items listed therein accurately reflected the association's true revenue and expenditure situation regarding relief funds during the stated period. Zhu's telegrams detailing the emergency relief distributed to various counties in Shaanxi, as well as work relief for water conservancy, burial assistance, purchase of cattle, well drilling, and subsidies to disaster relief orphanages, have also been mailed to Shanghai. It is reported that the committee will publish these details in the newspaper soon to reassure the generous donors who contributed to disaster relief. The committee's efficient operations and complete procedures set a rare standard for disaster relief efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Disaster Relief Committee Suggests Borrowing Rent from the City <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Expresses Disapproval</p>
<p>Since the floods occurred in various places, the Capital Disaster Relief Committee proposed borrowing rent from the city to relieve the suffering of the people. However, according to the municipal government yesterday, although borrowing rent was implemented once during the campaign against Feng Yuxiang, it was done out of necessity due to military tension and the Ministry of Finance had previously consulted with Shanghai's banking and money industries. Therefore, it was reluctantly done to suppress rebellion and quell internal strife for the sake of the nation, but the method was not appropriate. The Chinese area is currently hoping to build houses and develop the city, so that future construction can compete with the concessions and correct the erroneous perceptions of citizens. If repeated disturbances are added, homeowners will be afraid to move forward, which will contradict the purpose of developing the city in the Chinese area. However, relieving disaster victims is also an urgent matter, but other methods should be used and not rent.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association received an urgent telegram from the Party Affairs Rectification Committee of Huangchuan County, Henan, stating: "Huangchuan County has repeatedly suffered from banditry, and the people are unable to bear their lives. Unexpectedly, disaster has struck again. On June 18, heavy rain poured down for days, causing mountain floods to rage and waves to surge. As far as the eye can see, the villages and fields have become a swamp. Houses have been submerged, and crops have been washed away. Countless residents have perished in the waves. Now, their homes have been reduced to nothing, and their fields have turned into mud. The disaster victims have nowhere to live and are camping in the open, their cries echoing through the wilderness. Witnessing this tragedy, our committee proposes disaster relief, but due to limited financial resources, we hereby telegraph, requesting the party and country's virtuous leaders, benevolent people, and righteous individuals to generously provide assistance to save these survivors." They also received a telegram from various organs and organizations in Hefei County, Anhui, stating: "Hefei is unfortunately stricken by a sudden mountain flood, turning the county seat into a swamp. The embankments have all been destroyed, and crops and houses have been washed away without a trace. Deaths of people and livestock are too numerous to count. This catastrophic disaster is rare in a century. In addition to organizing a disaster relief fundraising committee, we humbly request your assistance to avert this catastrophe." They also received an urgent telegram from the Disaster Relief Branch Association of Taixing County, Jiangsu, stating: "Taixing County has been inundated with three days of heavy rain since the 4th of this month, turning the fields into swamps. Unexpectedly, on the 11th, a hurricane struck again, and the floodwaters deepened, making drainage difficult, resulting in a vast expanse of water. Collapsed houses and injured people are frequently reported. Currently, the entire county is almost completely submerged in floodwaters. The disaster is of unprecedented magnitude in decades. Future food supplies are a cause for concern, and how to maintain the current situation is an urgent matter. We earnestly request immediate relief." They also received an urgent telegram from the Kuomintang Executive Committee of Gaoyou County, Jiangsu, stating: "Since the summer, our county has been ravaged by continuous rain, coupled with the overflowing of the Huai, Yi, and Si rivers and the surge of the Yangtze River tide. The water level in the rivers and lakes is rising rapidly. Fields and crops have been submerged, and disaster victims are everywhere. The disaster is severe, and the situation is perilous. All disaster victims in the county are clamoring for food. We hereby appeal for immediate relief to aid the disaster victims." They also received a telegram from the Hubei Flood Relief Association stating: "Hubei Province has experienced continuous heavy rain, causing the Yangtze and Han rivers to swell. Many embankments along both banks have collapsed, and the residents of the three towns have suffered a major catastrophe. The dire situation is difficult to describe fully. However, the disaster area is too large, and relief is urgently needed. We hope you will raise your voice and lend a helping hand. May benevolent and righteous people provide a continuous stream of aid." They also received an urgent telegram from various organizations in Tongling County, Anhui, stating: "Tongling is located near the Yangtze River and has a low-lying terrain. Since spring and summer, there has been continuous rain, causing mountain floods to break through all embankments. Fields, livestock, and houses have been lost, and those displaced are crying to the heavens. They are exposed to the wind and eat in the open, which is unbearable to witness. Now, the autumn harvest is hopeless, and the supply of firewood and rice has been cut off. The hardship has reached its peak. We urgently request immediate relief to save lives."</p>

<p>The Cantonese opera troupe "Yong Shou Nian Ban," featuring Bai Yutang, Qianli Ju, and Li Yunnong, has consulted with the Shanghai Performing Arts Federation regarding fundraising methods, considering the recent floods in various provinces.

<p>Disaster Reports Received by the Ji Sheng Association</p>
<p>The China Ji Sheng Association reported that various legal organizations in Jiangpu County, Jiangsu, stated: "Jiangpu County, bordering the Yangtze River to the front and Anhui Province to the rear, has been plagued by rain for a month, resulting in mountain floods. In the northern area, most of the polders have been breached, and countless people have been swept away. On the 23rd and 24th of last month, torrential rain poured down day and night, coupled with the overflow of the Yellow Mountain flood for 800 miles in northern Anhui, which flowed straight down. All polder embankments were breached. Even villages and towns on flat ground, such as Chahe, Dongge, Yongning, and Tangquan, were submerged in several feet of water, causing the Jinpu Railway to be washed away for more than ten miles, suspending train service for about four or five days. The entire area was a vast expanse of water without boundaries. People, livestock, and objects were swept away without a trace. Disaster victims who climbed trees were rescued by the urgent relief association, while no fewer than several thousand people took their families and sought refuge in the mountains, exposed to the wind and rain, crying for food. Due to the turbulent floodwaters, those who failed to escape in time drowned in large numbers. The magnitude of this catastrophe is unprecedented. They have dispatched Xu Rangsan and Gu Laixi to report the disaster to the provincial and Shanghai authorities, calling for prompt relief to save lives." They have also received reports from more than ten counties, including Taixing, Wujin, Jiangning, and Huaiyin, regarding the disaster situation, which are similar in essence. Some report that the people are destitute and awaiting rescue from the ditches, while others report that agriculture has been devastated and they hope to alleviate the great suffering of hunger. The cries of disaster victims are everywhere, and the number of dead and wounded is unprecedented in hundreds of years, making it a catastrophe for hundreds of millions of people. Their voices are hoarse and painful, and they have no tears to shed. They ask for a drop of Yangzhi (compassion) to be the savior of thousands of families. Those with a heart to save the world should seize this opportunity to do immeasurable good. Let generous aid flow continuously and in abundance. We look forward to it."</p>

<p>The Province Divided into Nine Zones</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from special investigators Wu Jiasan and Wei Keqiang, who were dispatched to investigate the disaster situation: "The communist bandits in Jiangxi Province are gradually being suppressed. The Party and Government Committee has divided the disaster area into nine zones, establishing a sub-association with a director in each zone, overseeing several counties, to handle various party, government, and relief matters. The first zone includes Xiushui, Wuning, Yifeng, and Tonggu; the second zone includes Pingxiang, Wanzai, Yichun, and Fenyi; the third zone includes Yongxin, Anfu, Lianhua, Ningguo, and Suichuan; the fourth zone includes Jian, Yongfeng, Jishui, Wan'an, and Taihe; the fifth zone includes Ganxian, Yundu, Xingguo, Nankang, and Xinfeng; the sixth zone includes Guangchang, Ningdu, Shicheng, and Ruijin; the seventh zone includes Nanfeng, Yihuang, Le'an, Nancheng, and Lichuan; the eighth zone includes Jinxi, Guixi, Yujiang, Zixi; the ninth zone includes Shangrao, Yiyang, Yushan, Guangfeng, Dexing, Hengfeng, and Qianshan. Almost every county in the nine zones has suffered, but the sixth zone is the most severely affected, followed by the third, eighth, and seventh zones. Yesterday, we met with Commander Xiong Tianyi and Chief Wen Shaoyun, who agreed to allocate 5,000 yuan from the relief funds allocated by our association to the fifth zone, which has just been cleared of bandits, where disaster victims are gathered and clamoring for food, as emergency relief to prevent starvation. This is only a temporary measure to address the immediate needs and is not enough to be universally distributed. The entire province is paralyzed, and people are in dire straits, awaiting rescue. Commander Wen and Chief Wen deeply hope that charitable organizations in Shanghai will follow Article 8 of the Jiangxi Province relief regulations, which states that for counties with deep disasters, no income, and no ability to raise funds, charitable organizations should discuss bringing funds and personnel to manage the relief in a county or several counties, providing emergency relief to save tens of millions of dying disaster victims. Please dispatch personnel to Jiangxi as soon as possible to engage in disaster relief in a county or several counties, or designate several counties to provide emergency relief to save tens of millions of dying disaster victims. Jiangxi Province has been ravaged by both communist bandits and continuous rain, resulting in a severe flood disaster. The disaster situation is extremely serious, and it is necessary to raise a large amount of funds to alleviate this catastrophe. As for designating counties for relief, please submit it to the Standing Committee for review and resolution. Raising relief funds is a matter of utmost urgency. We urge you to broadly solicit donations to save these survivors. We cannot express enough our plea on behalf of the people in this telegram. Secretary Wei Keqiang, Advisor Wu Jiasan."</p>

<p>Treatment Conditions Will Be Discussed at Mediation</p>
<p>After the printing industry in the city went on strike, the Bureau of Social Affairs first summoned representatives from both sides for questioning yesterday afternoon to facilitate mediation. Qu Shou Kang and Xia Hailin represented the Printing Industry Workers' Union, while Dai Zhong Lin, He Zhijin, Chen Bing Xi, and Jin Shun Qing represented the Printing Industry Guild. Lu Yin Chu represented the City Party Headquarters. Zhang Shuye of the Bureau of Social Affairs questioned the parties, and Wang Zhiqin took notes. The guild representatives insisted on a nine-hour workday. Both sides held their ground, arguing fiercely. Zhang Shuye advised both sides to resume work first and temporarily maintain the nine-hour workday while awaiting lawful mediation. If an eight-hour workday is prescribed in the future, overtime wages can be paid for the extra hour worked. The treatment conditions will be discussed when the mediation committee is formally convened. The labor representatives accepted the advice and agreed to return to the union to discuss it with the workers before making a decision. They then notified the members to temporarily resume work as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Two Courts Officially Open This Morning <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai Second Special District District Court have largely completed their internal organization since their establishment. Besides emergency cases, which were tried once a few days ago, the courts continued to hear four emergency cases yesterday. From 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM, the Second Special District District Court held its first court affairs meeting to properly distribute various tasks. The courts are scheduled to officially open this morning around 10:00 AM to hear new and old civil and criminal cases. At the same time, they will officially begin accepting litigation documents. News from yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Continued Hearing of Urgent Cases: Yesterday morning, the French Concession police department delivered three urgent criminal cases to the Second Special District District Court, including cases of fighting, counterfeiting trademarks, and prostitutes soliciting customers. The trademark counterfeiting case was an old case. Because the suspect is currently in custody, the police department was allowed to deliver the case for trial on the originally scheduled continuation date. Only one case requiring transfer was received in the afternoon. All cases were heard by Criminal Division Chief Ge Zhi Qin. The three cases in the morning were heard from 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM, and the case in the afternoon was heard from approximately 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. All cases were adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>Court Affairs Meeting: Yesterday afternoon at 3:15 PM, the President of the Second Special District District Court, Ying Shi, convened the first court affairs meeting with the division chiefs and judges. Attendees included President Ying Shi, Civil Division judges Pang Shurong and Qu Zengze, Criminal Division judges Luo Renji and Xiong Huiping, Civil Summary Court judge Zhu Ganlin, Criminal Summary Court judge Wu Fanglian, and Criminal Division Chief Ge Zhi Qin (who joined after hearing cases), totaling eight people. The discussion lasted approximately two hours, ending at 5:15 PM. It is reported that the work of civil and criminal matters has been properly distributed and that the document section has created a list so that they can begin processing the work today.</p>
<p>Official Opening: The official opening is scheduled to begin around 10:00 AM this morning. Because the French police department cannot deliver the cases in time, it cannot be any earlier. The cases to be heard first have not yet been determined because the French side has not provided the registry after receiving the old cases. Therefore, it is not yet possible to decide. The official opening today will only hear new cases and old cases that are scheduled for continuation today. All old civil and criminal cases that do not have a scheduled continuation date and must be heard by the District Court must wait until the registry is received from the French side, sorted by type, and then summoned for hearing. It is expected to take another week from today.</p>
<p>Prison Repairs: After the judicial police officers of the French side guarding the prison handed over their duties last time, they dismantled or removed many of the original firefighting equipment, prisoner washing equipment, and other miscellaneous items in the prison before they left. The Chief Clerk of the Second Special District District Court, Xiao Quanfang, negotiated with French Consul General Canglin on behalf of the court. The French Consul General formally replied to Xiao yesterday afternoon that he agreed to repair them according to the number and set an engineer to investigate and deal with it today.</p>
<p>Permission to Appeal: In the last few days before the French Tribunal was handed over, it hastily judged many civil and criminal cases, resulting in a large number of dissatisfied parties. According to the Chief Clerk Xiao Jinfang's statement regarding this type of case, these cases should be enforced according to the adjudication according to the agreement terms. However, those who believe that the adjudication is unfair and express their dissatisfaction can appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court within fifteen days of the adjudication. The High Court will accept the appeal in order to resolve the issue fairly.</p>
<p>Zhu and Gong Go to Qingdao: Former French Tribunal Judges Zhu Qi and Gong Xiang did not retain their positions after the Tribunal was reorganized by our country's Ministry of Justice. Therefore, they took a company steamer with their families to Qingdao yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Measures for Increased Fees for Foreign Ship Pilots <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Last month, the pilots of foreign ships in the city went on strike to demand higher fees, lasting for a week. After mediation by the Director of the Jianghai Customs Port Authority, they resumed work first, with a two-week deadline for the shipping companies to decide whether to increase fees and reply to the Pilots' Association. This matter has been reported in this newspaper several times. On the 4th of this month, the two-week deadline expired. The reporter made thorough inquiries into the situation and recorded what he heard below:</p>
<p>Temporary No Fee Increase: Since the pilots resumed work on July 22, the foreign ships in Shanghai have convened several meetings to discuss the matter. The majority of the companies concluded that they should maintain the old rules and not advocate for higher fees. The shipping companies believe that they already bear a large amount of pilotage fees and that maritime transport business has been declining recently. Therefore, they decided to take a calm attitude towards the issue. Ships will continue to enter and exit the port according to the old rules, and the shipping companies will not respond to the Pilots' Association, leaving the matter unresolved. Therefore, there has been no expression recently.</p>
<p>Shortened Pilotage Line: After the Port Director's mediation, the shipping companies telegraphed their respective headquarters to report on the progress and request instructions regarding the fee increase. During these two weeks, the shipping companies consulted back and forth on this matter more than once. It is said that the ship owners unanimously opposed the increase in pilotage fees and, as a precaution, the shipping companies negotiated with the captains of ships sailing to the Far East. In the event that the pilots insist on raising fees, the shipping companies can also accommodate it, but on the condition that the pilotage line is shortened. In the past, foreign ships coming to Shanghai had to engage a pilot from Tongsha to Wu Song, and then take them into the Huangpu River. The same was true for ships leaving the port. The sea route was very long and required two sets of fees. Now, it will be changed so that ships travel on their own from Tongsha to Wu Song (the ship owners and chief mates are familiar with this section), and then engage a pilot at the mouth of Wu Song to guide them in. In this way, 4/5ths of the pilotage sea route can be reduced, and the ships will only have to pay for a short section of pilotage. Even if they fully accept the association's demands, they can actually reduce the cost by 3/5ths. It is understood that the shipping companies have decided to adopt this proposal: if the pilots insist on raising fees, they will shorten the pilotage line. If the pilots shelve the fee increase, they will maintain the original status and not change it for the time being.</p>

<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that Australian aviator Bert Hinkler, piloting a small aircraft, departed from Australia, intending to travel via the Philippines, China, Japan, cross the Pacific Ocean to Canada, then cross the Atlantic Ocean to London. Yesterday evening (the 4th), the local Asiatic Petroleum Company received a telegram stating that Hinkler departed from Manila two days ago and arrived at Tamsui in Taiwan. He will now fly from Tamsui to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive in Wusong today (the 5th). However, very little information has been received locally regarding the flight, as Hinkler originally did not plan to pass through China. Later, because the Japanese authorities prohibited him from flying over strategic areas in Taiwan, he temporarily changed his route, hence his flight to Shanghai from Taiwan. It is expected that he will now take a route via Peiping (Beijing) to Japan. The Asiatic Petroleum Company in Shanghai has prepared everything and will proceed to Wusong to welcome him upon receiving his departure telegram. The duration of Hinkler's stay in Shanghai is currently unknown, but it is estimated that he will stay for a day or two.</p>

<p>Ye Ruchun Firmly Maintains His Innocence</p>
<p>Rong Jiannan Believes He Deserves to Die</p>
<p>Zhu Rongsheng Misses His Elderly Mother</p>
<p>Wang Zhongmei Still Has Maxims</p>
<p>Ye Ruchun, a 37-year-old native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, residing at No. 15 Zhibu Road, Shanghai, owner of the Shanghai Gramophone Company, also worked as a special patrolman for the Public Concession Police. Due to suspicion of involvement in kidnapping, he was apprehended by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Inspector Liu Shaokui, and Detective Feng Zhiming of the General Inspectorate, along with his accomplices Rong Jiannan, Zhu Rongsheng, and Wang Zhongmei. All were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation. It was revealed that Ye and his gang, on the evening of September 18th of last year, armed and organized, kidnapped Cai Fulin, a comprador of the British-American Tobacco Company, on Hart Road. Furthermore, in October of the same year, they robbed prostitutes Ye Feilong, Jia Baoyu, Miaofenglou, and Xiangfei of their belongings in rooms 44 of the Eastern Hotel and 314 of the New World Hotel. After repeated questioning and clarification, Ye, Rong, Zhu, and Wang were each sentenced to death. The sentences were reported to the Provincial Government for approval and execution. Yesterday morning marked the date of execution by firing squad. Ye Ruchun's elderly mother and wife, having received the news, arrived at the court grounds outside the Special Court around 7:00 AM, standing in anticipation. Around 8:00 AM, as Ye and the other three were escorted by the police, Ye's mother and others, upon seeing them, began to cry loudly, tears streaming down their faces, causing temporary disorder. After being dispersed by Chinese and Western police officers, order was restored. Subsequently, Judge Zhou Hanting presided over the Third Criminal Court, and Police Barrister Li Zhishan ordered the four defendants to be brought to the case one by one. According to Ye Ruchun's statement, he was 37 years old, from Yuyao, and previously worked with watches and clocks, and also as a special patrolman. He claimed complete ignorance of the alleged kidnapping case and insisted on his innocence, stating that if he knew anything about it, he would be willing to be subjected to lingering death and have his entire family shot. He requested justice. Judge Zhou repeatedly informed Ye that today was the execution date, and he could use this time to explain any last words to his family. However, Ye continued to shout and protest his innocence incessantly. Judge Zhou ordered him to be taken down. Following this, Rong Jiannan stated that he was 32 years old, from Wuxi, residing in Taide Lane. He said, "I am being executed today for kidnapping, and I do not feel wronged, but Ye Ruchun is completely innocent." Zhu Rongsheng stated that he was 29 years old, from Jiangyin, unemployed, and had no last words. His statement was the same as Rong's. Wang Zhongmei stated that he was 33 years old, from Jiangyin, and worked as a doctor. "Today, I represent all the criminals in prison to express my opinions to the judge. Most of the prisoners are currently suffering from illness. According to my experience as a doctor, this is undoubtedly due to starvation. Because the food in prison is insufficient, it fails to satisfy the prisoners' hunger. Kidnapping can be divided into three classes, and my involvement in kidnapping was not due to hunger or cold, nor was it for eating, drinking, or gambling, but purely for the country." He then began to rant about national affairs. His words were incoherent. Finally, he raised his voice and sang the Beijing opera "He Heavily Condemns Mao Yanshou." Judge Zhou ordered him to be taken down. Consequently, the Chinese and Western police officers, along with the entire case file and photos, escorted them onto a car and drove directly to the Caohejing execution ground. They notified the Local Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Wu Shixin as the execution officer, along with Clerk Qian Yinpei, Examiner Xuan Zhiming, and others. They also ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing and Police Officer Chen Xihui to supervise the execution officers Wang Jianqing, Xue Bingzhang, Yin Daoxu, Zhu Wanyuan, Hu Xianglin, Zhang Chunsen, Zhou Qiwen, Zhu Baochang, Jiang Huanzhang, Li Jiajun, Chen Yinzhi, and more than ten others, who traveled to the execution ground by car. The judge then, along with Warden Dong Changmin, took their seats in the official position. Ye Ruchun was brought forward and stated, "I am 37 years old, from Yuyao, residing at No. 15 Zhibu Road. I have a mother, three wives, and sons at home. I want my family to teach my sons well. I am going to die, truly wronged." He had four lines of poetry to express to the heavens, a seven-character quatrain: "My body is killed, but my soul does not die, I go to the nine springs to chase your soul, There will be a day when retribution arrives, I am not afraid that your vicious fate is difficult to escape." He requested the clerk to record it, and tears streamed down his face. At this point, the official asked Rong Jiannan, "32 years old, from Wuxi, residing in Taide Lane, Hart Road. I have a mother and wife. The instigator of this case was Yang Yousheng. I also have a poem, please record it: "Living in this world, failing to recognize one's friends, has led to this. Today, I die without regret, but I pity Mr. Ye's deep innocence." Then, the official asked Zhu Rongsheng, "29 years old, from Jiangyin, residing at No. 11 Zhoujiaqiao. I have parents, a wife, and a child. I want my brother to be filial to my mother, do not worry about me." It was heard that Wang Zhongmei stated, "33 years old, from Dongtai, residing at No. 1155 Kade Lane, Xinzha Road. I have parents, a wife, and children. My will is to tell future generations not to be as absurd as I was. I completely fell into economic panic due to smoking and drinking, leading to my downfall and sacrificing my life. It was intentional, so I have a poem to advise a group of villains: "Evil is like a red flower, good is like a pine, the green pine is not as good-looking as the flower, one day when the frost falls, only the green pine is seen, not the flower." I also have a maxim to advise against smoking and drinking: "Smoking can ruin one's family," "Drinking can cause disaster." Alright, please execute me." The judge then ordered the execution. Police Chief Xu directed the police officers to execute the criminals by firing squad. The bodies were collected by the morgue to await identification by relatives.</p>

<p>Chen Ruiqing Plagued by Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Daughter Subjected to Abuse by Indian Man</p>
<p>Indian Man Now Abandoning Daughter and Trying to Escape</p>
<p>Request for Strict Handling by the British Public Concession</p>
<p>Borrowing Money from an Indian: Chen Ruiqing, a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu, in his forties, runs the Wanyuanxiang Coffin Shop on North Chengdu Road in Shanghai. He has a daughter named Genfu, who is seventeen years old, fashionably dressed, and exceptionally beautiful. Chen loves her as the apple of his eye. However, Chen's shop is not doing well and often operates at a loss. He has no choice but to borrow from outside. He met an Indian man named Jagat Ram, who lives at No. 150 Mayback Road, already fifty years old. He possesses vast wealth but does not engage in production, relying on exorbitant interest rates to make a living. When lending money, regardless of the amount, he charges a flat monthly interest rate of 10% (i.e., one dime of interest per dollar borrowed per month). Chen, through various connections, became acquainted with Jagat. Learning that Jagat specialized in lending, he frequently borrowed money from him, accumulating debts of around 300 yuan, which he was unable to repay for a time.</p>
<p>Harassing His Cherished Daughter: After being introduced to Chen through friends and becoming more familiar with him due to their financial dealings, Jagat frequently visited Chen's home. He caught sight of Chen's daughter and was captivated by her beauty, harboring improper intentions. Therefore, he never mentioned collecting Chen's debts and often visited Chen's home at his leisure, deliberately acting lavishly, lingering, and reluctant to leave. Whenever he had the opportunity, he flirted with Genfu, offering her gifts that young women loved, flattering her with sweet words, and using all sorts of enticements. Genfu, being young and naive, was charmed by him, while Chen remained unaware.</p>
<p>Actually Marrying an Indian Man: Chen owed Jagat 300 yuan, which he had been unable to repay for a long time. By the end of last year, Jagat suddenly changed his usual amiable attitude and sternly demanded repayment, claiming that the principal and interest had reached over 600 yuan. If Chen did not repay, he would take him to court. He also said that he had a perfect solution for Chen's predicament. If Chen was willing to give his daughter in marriage to him, not only would the previous debts be completely canceled, but he would also give Chen another 400 yuan. Chen, plagued by financial difficulties, did not want his beloved daughter to be abused by this foreigner, but he had no other solution. Genfu, realizing that she had already lost her virginity to Jagat, did not object either. After several discussions, a marriage agreement was reached. They chose the 18th day of the lunar new year of this year to hold the wedding ceremony. An elderly husband and a young wife, with different nationalities, was truly an improper match.</p>
<p>Indian Man Secretly Planning to Return Home: After the marriage, their lives were relatively harmonious. Jagat gave Genfu one dollar every day to cover her small expenses, as usual. Recently, Genfu became three months pregnant. However, for some unknown reason, Jagat suddenly conceived the idea of returning home. He secretly moved all the household items out, abandoning Genfu. Yesterday, he secretly boarded the (Tevue) steamer to return home. Genfu received a tip from an Indian man (a friend of Jagat), and immediately rushed to the ship with her father, grabbing Jagat and crying hysterically. She accused Jagat of seducing and forcing her into marriage, and now abandoning her, and insisted on suing him in court. Chen also helped his daughter hold onto Jagat, refusing to let him go. Jagat struggled violently, punching Chen and injuring him, and tearing his trousers. Genfu's black Indian silk cheongsam was torn open on both sides, exposing her chest. Chen and his daughter were unable to succeed by force, and turned to the customs police station for help.</p>
<p>Truly Devoid of Conscience: Upon receiving the complaint, the police head dispatched Chinese detectives Sun Agui and Wu Wenqing, and Western detective Brett Sikes, who contacted the Hongkou Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to the ship to arrest Jagat and take him to the Hongkou Police Station to await interrogation by the British Public Concession. The head of the water patrol police station also ordered Chen to go to the hospital for a medical examination to serve as evidence of Jagat's assault. It was heard that Genfu stated in her statement to the police that she had been seduced by Jagat at the age of fifteen and forced into marriage this spring. Now, she is three months pregnant, but he treats her like a thorn in his side, moving out all the furniture and deliberately abandoning her. Even her beloved phonograph, which she had saved up for with her daily one-dollar allowance for groceries, was taken away, intending to return home and disappear. He is truly devoid of conscience. She will request the British Public Concession to severely punish him based on the above crimes.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Father and Son Commit Suicide One After the Other <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Son Unable to Withstand Debt Pressure Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Father Unwilling to Live Due to Son's Death</p>
<p>Around 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, a case of father and son committing suicide occurred in the Zhoujiaqiao area in western Shanghai. The son, unable to withstand the pressure of debt, committed suicide by consuming opium. The father, grieving over his son's unnatural death, angrily committed suicide by stabbing himself with a knife. He was on the verge of death, causing a great commotion. Those who heard about it were saddened. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Impoverished Family: Xia Yutian, a 51-year-old native of Tongzhou, currently resides at No. 22 of the Minsheng Yarn Factory Workers' Quarters in Zhoujiaqiao, western Shanghai. He only has one son, named Shaoqing, who is 22 years old. He works as a factory worker for a living, working diligently and frugally, and is loved by his father. Because the father is poor and elderly and unable to work, he relies entirely on his son for a living. Therefore, in recent years, Shaoqing has saved some money from his work, in addition to the living expenses of the father and son. Last summer, he married a woman named Zhang, from the same hometown, through a matchmaker. After the marriage, Shaoqing, bearing an even heavier burden, asked someone to introduce his wife, Zhang, to work at the Minsheng Yarn Factory to help with household expenses.</p>
<p>Committing Suicide by Smoking Opium: Around 12:00 AM the night before last, the Caojiadu Sixth District Police Station in western Shanghai received a report from women Xia Zhang, Zhang Weishen, and Jin Heshang, who brought Xia Caifu to the station, accusing Xia Caifu of forcing them to pay debts, leading to Mrs. Zhang's husband being forced to commit suicide by consuming opium. After separate inquiries by the district head, according to Xia Zhang's statement, her husband, Xia Shaoqing, had found it difficult to make ends meet this year due to the rising cost of living. He had borrowed 30 yuan from his paternal uncle, Xia Caifu, around May of the lunar calendar, agreeing to repay it in one month. Unexpectedly, as soon as the deadline arrived, the uncle repeatedly came to demand repayment and also asked Weng Yutian to collect the debt. Her husband, unable to find a solution, begged him to postpone it, but the uncle continued to press him. Her husband, forced to do so, conceived the idea of ending his life. Last night, after a slight argument with his uncle, he secretly consumed opium and committed suicide. He was sent to the Labor Hospital but could not be saved. She requested justice. According to Zhang Weishen, 30 years old, from Tongzhou, residing on Qimei Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Xia Shaoqing is my nephew-in-law. Her statement was the same as Xia Zhang's. According to Jin Heshang, 26 years old, residing on Broadway Road, he and the deceased Xia Shaoqing are friends. His statement was the same as above. According to the defendant, Xia Caifu, 39 years old, from Tongzhou, residing on Xiangyan Bridge, Shaoqing is his cousin. He had borrowed 30 yuan from me, and I did not force him excessively. I do not know the reason why he committed suicide by consuming opium.</p>
<p>Suiciding Out of Anger and Grief: Xia Yutian, the father of the deceased Xia Shaoqing, seeing his son die an unnatural death, immediately burst into tears, and his grief was overwhelming. Realizing that his son had died and there was no one to rely on, his livelihood was cut off. While his daughter-in-law and others were reporting the incident to the district office, he felt unwilling to live and took a sharp blade and stabbed himself forcefully three times in a row, causing blood to flow profusely and he collapsed to the ground. Neighbors, seeing the tragic scene, immediately rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. After examination by the doctor, there were three wounds on his testicles, and his scrotum was ruptured, causing a large amount of bleeding. He was dying. A report of the injury was submitted to the district office. His daughter-in-law, upon hearing this, was terrified and even more grief-stricken. Yesterday afternoon, it was reported that Xia Yutian had also died.</p>
<p>Taken to Court Together: After receiving the report, the Sixth District Head, believing that the case involved debt pressure leading to death, submitted a document yesterday morning to transfer the four original defendants to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Zhu Shisheng's Sudden Death Case <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zhang Seems to Be Involved</p>
<p>Various Parties Say Her Reputation Is Terrible</p>
<p>Zhu Shisheng, a local native, 53 years old, owner of a local goods department store at No. 100 Yangshuo Road, had been widowed for many years and had three daughters. On the 24th of last month, his second daughter, named Simei, 26 years old, died of illness. On the same day, at noon, she was dressed for burial and a funeral was held. However, Zhu's second wife, Zhang, 28 years old, had a sudden argument with Zhu Shisheng around 6:00 PM because of Simei's death. Zhu suddenly fell to the ground and called for help, losing consciousness. Later, he was sent to Tongde Hospital at No. 1 Tongfu Road. Despite treatment by Dr. Qin, he died at 2:00 AM the next morning. His body was sent to the Philemon Road Morgue for examination. Zhang was taken to the police station by Detective Gui Shou of the Yangshupu Police Station, and the police chief ordered her to be transferred to the women's detention center to await trial.</p>
<p>Police Lawyer States the Case: Yesterday morning, Special Court Judge Xiao Xiefei of the First Special District specially opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. According to Police Barrister Li Zhishan's statement of the case, the police accused the defendant of the crime of injury resulting in death under Article 296 of the Criminal Law. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant's reputation was notoriously bad. At the time, the deceased's death was caused by injury to his testicles. Dr. Qin and many witnesses are present to testify. Dr. Qin's examination report was presented for inspection, and a request was made for a strict investigation.</p>
<p>Doctor Proves Blood Vessel Rupture: According to Dr. Qin Daoyuan's statement, he received a phone call around 10:00 PM that day and went to Zhu's home. Zhu Shisheng was already sleeping upstairs, unconscious. He was sent to my hospital. The cause of his illness was that he was old and weak, and his brain's blood vessels had ruptured. If the patient is frightened, angered, or hit by an object, his blood vessels will rupture. The lower part of his body was slightly swollen, but the scrotum was not broken. A little white discharge was visible in the glans, but it could not be determined whether it was indeed leukorrhea, nor could it be determined whether the testicles had been damaged. In short, the cause of death was blood vessel rupture. The defendant was present when Zhu Shisheng died and was detained. She also volunteered to go to court.</p>
<p>Eldest Daughter Sheds Tears While Testifying: Zhu Fuying, the eldest daughter of the deceased's first wife, 31 years old, married to Zhang Xinglin, stated that her stepmother and father were fighting, and she was out attending her sister Simei's funeral and did not witness it. When she returned, the crowd told her that her father had been beaten to death by his stepmother. She went upstairs to see her father, but he could not speak. In the past, her father and stepmother often quarreled because she had a lover outside. Her father repeatedly told her that he would definitely be harmed by her in the future and that she must seek justice for her father after his death. She shed tears as she spoke. The fifth daughter stated that she was 24 years old and lived in Yinxiang Port. She rushed there that day because of her sister Simei's funeral and saw many people at the door, saying that her father had been beaten by his stepmother and sent to Tongde Hospital. She went to visit him and saw that he could not speak.</p>
<p>Statements of Neighbors and Melon Sellers: According to witness Li Chunrong, who was a neighbor, Zhu Shisheng ran to the door and was chased out by the defendant, who pulled him into the shop and pushed him onto a rattan chair. Zhu cried out for help. Her husband and wife often quarreled, and it was heard that the defendant had an affair with someone outside. According to Yuan Abao, who was also a melon seller nearby, Zhu Shisheng was dragged into the shop by the defendant at the shop door and pushed into a chair, crying for help. Suddenly, he stopped speaking, as if he were dead. I persuaded the defendant not to beat him, but she said he was pretending to be dead. If he really died, she might buy four boards and six nails to make a coffin for him and told me to leave and not to meddle. According to Yao Fuqing, who was a worker in a nearby sock factory, as he passed by Zhu's shop, a woman told him that Zhu's boss had been brutally beaten by his wife and was about to die. According to Zhang Heshang, Zhu Shisheng was his uncle, and he did not see the defendant fighting, but he heard shouts for help. He went to see and saw him sitting in a chair.</p>
<p>Zhang Tries to Shirk Responsibility in Her Testimony: Zhang stated that she was married to the deceased and had been married for nineteen years and had seven pregnancies. They had always been on good terms. At the time, her son-in-law Zhang Xinglin invited people to come and beat me and trampled on her husband. I did not damage his testicles, but I did pull his arm. Her husband was addicted to alcohol and suffered from leukorrhea. Moreover, when her husband was dying, she did not run away from the hospital. After a while, police officers arrived to arrest her. The whole matter was that her son-in-law Zhang Xinglin wanted to plot against the family property. There were two Fang family contracts that he had borrowed. I wanted to rely on my husband for a living and would never do this. She also hired lawyers Lin Yinqing and others to defend her.</p>
<p>Debate Over, Date Set for Sentencing: Zhang Xinglin denied inviting the underworld people to beat the defendant. He was out attending his sister-in-law's funeral and returned to find that his father-in-law had been beaten by the defendant and was already upstairs. He immediately sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he could not speak. Zhao Di, the daughter of the defendant, stated that she was 14 years old and had also returned from attending her fourth sister's funeral. A moment later, underworld people arrived to beat her mother, and her father stepped forward to dissuade them and was pushed and fell down. Later, her mother helped her father into the shop. After the lawyers on both sides debated, Judge Xiao ordered Zhu Zhang to be remanded in custody and to set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Ball of Interest Money <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Borrowing Two Dollars, Paying 20 Copper Coins in Interest Daily</p>
<p>Zhang Fugeng Unable to Repay Money, Uses Knife to Assault</p>
<p>Car driver Liu Wenluan, residing at No. 23 Xixiang Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, engages in lending money at exorbitant interest rates. Zhang Fugeng, a Suzhou native residing at No. 16 of the same lane, making a living by pulling a rickshaw, had borrowed two dollars from Liu and had to pay 20 copper coins in interest daily, which is commonly called "ball of interest money." At 9:30 PM the night before last, Liu demanded the interest money from Zhang but could not obtain it, causing a verbal dispute to arise. Zhang used a knife to slash Liu's legs twice, causing blood to flow profusely. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Zhang immediately abandoned the knife and fled, running to the intersection of Lafayette Road and Caishi Road. A French patrol police detective happened to be patrolling and saw it, and arrested Zhang along with his accomplice Shen Zaiqing and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were taken to the Second Special District Court for questioning. First, the police's acting lawyer explained the case, and then the plaintiff recounted the circumstances of the stabbing. Zhang Fugeng stated that the plaintiff had first hit him, so he acted in a moment of desperation. Shen Zaiqing stated that he had been advising from the side and did not dare to assist in the assault. Judge Ge Zhitan reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody to await a later trial.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Case of Accusation Against Zou Aizhen <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Zou Aizhen Submits Petition for Transfer of Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Awaiting Investigation by the Local Court Before Ruling</p>
<p>Economic Doctor Tang Huixuan and Lawyer Yan Yang'an jointly submitted a petition to the Special District Court, requesting permission to divorce his wife, Zou Aizhen. The main points of the lawsuit have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi of the Special Court's Civil Division 10 summoned Tang Huixuan to court. Zou Aizhen did not appear, nor was she represented by a lawyer. Tang Huixuan first stated his age and place of origin. Judge Yang then inquired whether No. 48, Baoshan Li, Baoding Road was his residence or a temporary lodging. Tang replied, "I used to work in other places, and my address was not fixed. Now I have been living in Shanghai for a long time, and No. 48, Baoshan Li, is my residence. However, my parents live in my ancestral home in Guangxi." Judge Yang then stated, "Now Zou Aizhen has submitted a petition to this court, requesting a transfer of jurisdiction, because she does not live at No. 1296, Route Lafayette, but lives in the Chinese-controlled area of Ximen. Therefore, she requests that the case be transferred to the Local Court for trial." The petition was then given to lawyer Yuan to read. Lawyer Yuan immediately rose and said, "Zou Aizhen previously also filed a lawsuit in the Local Court seeking a divorce from Tang. Judge Tong, who was presiding over the case, wanted to transfer the case to your court because Tang had moved to the concession, but Zou was unwilling and withdrew the lawsuit. Zou's current action is illegal and should be rejected." Judge Yang then announced that the case would be adjourned and a ruling would be made after an investigation with the Shanghai Local Court.</p>

During the heavy rain, the house of Zhang Zifeng, resident of No. 74, Yongxing Street, west of Xiaonanmen, was completely destroyed by lightning. For a while, the nearby residents crowded to watch, blocking the street. According to legend, a fox-like animal was struck by lightning, while others said a rat-like animal was struck, each person's account varied. However, the police officer stationed there stated that he only saw the roof being struck down and did not see any animal.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Further News After Ye Sheng's Suicide <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the suicide of the young man Ye Sheng, the court sent personnel to the coroner's office the day before yesterday to conduct an examination. Wu Laosan requested to waive the examination and, considering the past relationship, volunteered to take care of the funeral arrangements. The prosecutor approved it. Wu then bought a coffin and clothing, spending more than 200 yuan. It is found that the deceased Ye Sheng was indeed the grandson of the late Ye Chengzhong. He used to wander outside and did not engage in proper work, so he was expelled from the clan. At the beginning of this year, he met a woman named Wu Laosan, and they were deeply in love. They lived together on Longmen Road. At that time, Ye was in dire straits, and Wu Laosan provided him with food, clothing, and shelter. Later, Ye often went out to gamble, and his clothes were pawned. Ashamed to return home, he slept on the streets. When Wu Laosan found out, she tried to persuade him to no avail. Now his attitude had changed drastically, so he committed suicide by smoking opium.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Liang Yan Severing Ties <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Liang Zhiyun, a native of Fenghua, former adjutant of the Review and Preparation Office of the Nanjing General Headquarters, currently residing at the corner of Yuanfang Road and Zhoujiazu, opposite the Lianhua Nunnery, was recently sued in the Mediation Court of the Special District Court by Yan Yiqing, a native of Ningbo, requesting confirmation of no marital status. The plaintiff's lawsuit briefly stated that the plaintiff is currently 35 years old, and the defendant, Liang Zhiyun, is currently 32 years old. The plaintiff used to live in Hong Kong and met the defendant when she was 25 years old. Later, they traveled to Shanghai together and then lived together in Shanghai. At that time, the plaintiff had considerable private savings, exceeding ten thousand taels of silver. After living with the defendant, it was gradually used up, and he had no occupation and idled his days. In recent years, because the plaintiff's private savings have been exhausted, he has been abusive and often threatened her, saying that he wanted to kill her with a gun. Leaving aside such remarks, the plaintiff and the defendant have lived together without a marriage contract, no betrothal gifts, no marriage certificate, no matchmaker, and no ceremony. The cohabitation is entirely without legal conditions, and of course, there is no marital status or marital relationship, like what is commonly called "concubinage." Since there is no marital status and no marital relationship, they are naturally not bound by each other in law, because the law does not protect or prohibit this kind of illegal union. Whether to unite or separate is entirely up to the free will of the individuals, and there is no need to go through legal procedures. The law is such, but the plaintiff and the defendant have lived together for a long time, and she is deeply afraid that outsiders will misunderstand the truth, mistakenly recognizing the plaintiff as the defendant's wife and mistakenly recognizing the defendant as the plaintiff's husband. In this way, the man will not be able to marry, and the woman will not be able to marry, and will be restrained by him. Now, the plaintiff is determined to break off cohabitation with the defendant, and in order to avoid misunderstandings and to lift all kinds of constraints, she specially submits a petition. Yesterday, the case was heard in the Ninth Mediation Court. Neither party appeared, and the plaintiff's lawyer, Yu Hualong, stated that the feelings between the two parties had already broken down, and it would be difficult to obtain happiness if they were forced to live together. The best plan now is to sever relations from now on, and each person will be responsible for their own debts. Men and women are free to marry and marry as they please. The defendant's lawyer agreed, and a mediation agreement was signed in court, formally severing relations. From then on, the couple separated like swallows.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Record of the Trial of Niu Lan and Others <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guomin She, Niu Lan, director of the Eastern Department of the Third International, and his assistant Alis, were arrested by the Public Concession Police on June 15 in a secret Communist Party organ on Sichuan Road in this city, and more than 600 important pieces of evidence were seized. Among them, there were more than 100 documents concerning directing the Red Army in Jiangxi Province to resist the Central Government and providing economic assistance to the Communist Party throughout the country. At that time, it attracted the attention of the people of the whole country. The court postponed the trial until August 3 because it took a long time to organize the evidence. The following is a brief record of the trial. When the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court opened the trial of this case at 9 a.m. on that day, the observers included Mr. Zhang, representative of the Central Government, Zhan Jifeng, lawyer representing the Garrison Headquarters, and Lawyer Gan of the Police. Lawyer William, representing the defendant, was present. First, the judge inquired about the nationality, age, and name of the defendants Niu Lan and Alis. Then, the police lawyer reported the circumstances of the arrest and also stated that Niu and others should be extradited to mainland China for trial. Then Zhan Jifeng, the lawyer representing the Headquarters, rose and said that the case should be transferred to the inland government for trial. There are three preconditions: (1) Whether the defendant is a national of a country without treaty arrangements; (2) Where the criminal act took place; (3) Which judicial organ should handle the trial. On the first point, the defendant initially claimed to be a Belgian national, but after investigation, the defendant denied being a national of that country. Since the defendant cannot prove his nationality, he is a national of a country without treaty arrangements and should be subject to Chinese law. There is no doubt about this. On the second point, the defendant is an important person sent by the Third International to China to promote internal strife and engage in red-lining work. He is related to Zhu De and Mao Zedong, the leaders of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi, and Xiang Zhongfa, the Communist bandit recently arrested in Shanghai. The violent acts committed by these bandits all took place in the interior. Therefore, the defendant in this case should be extradited to be tried together. On the third point, the case committed by the defendant still violates the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters Military Law Review Office has the power to try the defendant. Also, according to Article 6 of the Agreement on the Recovery of Concession Courts, any criminal found in the Public Concession may be transferred to a government outside the concession after investigation by the court. Now, the two defendants are indeed criminals wanted by inland government according to law. Your court should assist and allow the investigators of our department to take the defendants back for interrogation. Then Zhang, the representative from the Central Government, explained the reasons and evidence for extraditing the criminals. (1) According to Gu Shunzhang, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and director of the Special Affairs Department, who was arrested by the Wuhan Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief in Hankou, the person in charge of the Third International in China was Mif. After he returned to his country, Niu Lan took over. According to Niu Lan's documents, the report to the Third International on Gu's arrest is very detailed. Based on this, it is sufficient to prove that Gu Shunzhang's confession is true, and at the same time, it can prove that Niu Lan is a major member of the Communist Party who endangers the Republic of China. (2) When Xiang Zhongfa, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, was arrested by the Garrison Department in Shanghai, he confessed to Niu Lan. Recently, Niu Lan remitted a huge amount of one million to the Chinese Communist Party for activities. Niu Lan's documents also described Xiang Zhongfa in great detail, and there is evidence to check. Based on this, it can better prove that Niu Lan specializes in inciting internal strife in China. (3) Niu Lan's documents report the Third International's direction of the Jiangxi Red Army to resist the Central Army and the development of the Communist bandits in great detail. Based on this, it is sufficient to prove that Niu Lan is the chief culprit in instigating internal strife in China. The court must pay special attention to this. (4) Niu Lan's documents contain many reports on directing workers' riots throughout Shanghai and directing Communist Parties across the country to subvert the National Government. I hope that the court will transfer Niu Lan and others to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial according to military law. Then William, the defendant Niu Lan's lawyer, argued that, according to the Chinese Covenant Law, Niu Lan could not be tried by military law. Mr. Zhang, the representative from the Central Government, immediately stated that the Covenant Law should be followed, but the Niu Lan case is closely related to the Gu bandit arrested in Wuhan and the Xiang bandit arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. At the same time, it violates the martial law regulations in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Shanghai. It should be sanctioned by the Chinese authorities for endangering the Republic of China in order to comply with the law. At 10:30, the court ordered a change of date for another trial.</p>

The First and Second Army Corps are pursuing in separate directions. A detailed report is being sent to you. I think it is not fully recorded. According to a telegram from Secretary Xiao of our office, Shi Chen of our Northeast Army launched a full-line offensive. By 9 p.m., Shi's troops had completely collapsed under heavy casualties and fled to the north bank of the Hutuo River. The number of captured soldiers is about 15,000, and the number of dead and wounded is about 8,000 to 9,000. The Northeast Army sent five brigades of infantry and two brigades of cavalry, 20 airplanes, to follow and pursue. Shang Zhen has left Niangziguan to attack the rear of Shi's forces. The remaining enemies can be cleared up soon. The military operations to suppress Shi have come to an end, and the general situation in North China has been established, according to Hongkui's report, which is roughly the same. Shi's rebellion against the country has aroused the common indignation of heaven and man. With this great creation, it is the blessing of the country and the happiness of the people.

<p>Mayor Zhang also received a telegram from Chairman Ma Fuxiang yesterday, saying, "To Mayor Zhang Yuejun of Shanghai: The Jiang Chen telegram has been received. I also received a telegram from Brother Weizhou Jiangzi, saying, 'The Eastern telegram has been received. After being hit head-on by our army, the rebellious troops suffered heavy casualties and fled in confusion to the area north of the Hutuo River at midnight on the 31st of last month. Our army captured many prisoners and seized countless spoils. Our First Army Corps has passed Dingzhou, and the vanguard of the army has arrived at Zhengding. Now, powerful troops are pursuing in separate directions. At the same time, our Second Army Corps and cavalry aircraft are blocking their rear, and we have telegraphed our Southern Route Army to jointly suppress them, with the aim of completely annihilating them to pacify the area. From now on, those who spread rumors will have no words to fake, and the leisurely mouths will be silenced. Sincerely, Your Brother Ma Fuxiang, bowing Jiang Shen Yin."</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I recently read a report in today's newspaper about the negotiations between the fire brigade and the telephone bureau. I was surprised to read that 30 or 40 members of our association surrounded the telephone bureau. Since our association was established last autumn and has been in operation for more than half a year, all expenses have been maintained by local gentry and businessmen who have borrowed and advanced money. Although the funding item has been approved by the municipal government and will be allocated monthly starting this year, it has not yet been received, so the economy is very stretched, resulting in several months of arrears in telephone bills. The bureau has not notified us recently and suddenly cut off the wires and stopped the call, resulting in the lack of news and the inability to rescue fire alarms, which has been criticized by the local area. Yesterday, due to the fire in Hongjili, Hongxing Road, the car arrived very late. The local people criticized us one after another. Our association has suffered injustice, so we went to the telephone to inquire about the reason for cutting the line and requested to restore the power. The surrounding situation may be a false rumor. I am deeply afraid of confusing the audience. Therefore, I hereby write to your newspaper for correction in order to show the reality, to the common friendship, Shanghai Zhabei District Fourth Section Fire Brigade, August 6.</p>
