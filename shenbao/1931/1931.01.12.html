<p>Expected to be Resolved Separately in Mid-February</p>
<p>Nanjing, sources in diplomatic circles say that the responses from countries such as Great Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil regarding legal rights are quite positive, expressing deep sympathy for China's desire to resolve extraterritoriality.

<p>Beijing, British and American bankers said that the ounce loan has not yet been specifically discussed, because the French and Belgian banking groups also hope to participate as a member of the new banking syndicate with half the qualification. If so, the Chinese side may not accept it. If it is optimistic, the investment conditions will not be harsh after the National Assembly is completed, but before the investment, a reorganization plan for unsecured foreign debt must be seen first. As the Chinese saying goes, "Don't even think about new loans until the old debts are paid off." Japanese banking groups observe that American loans have always been big talk and boasting, without success. This time, it is difficult to escape the old routine. If the British Can[adian] joins, the new syndicate signing countries will also follow suit. It is inevitable that borrowing money is implicitly related to politics and will be opposed by the Kuomintang. As a result, the sound of borrowing money is only to promote the reorganization of foreign debt. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Labor Unrest in Britain <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The current coal miners' strike in Britain is being mediated by the government, summoning both miners and mine owners to negotiate. Miners in South Wales have already gone on strike, and the Miners' General Association of Lancashire and Cheshire has passed a resolution advocating a nationwide miners' strike. The situation is very tense, and whether it can be calmed through mediation is still unknown. The cotton mill workers' strike in Britain is also in full swing, due to the factory's plan to increase the number of looms managed by each weaver. The weavers refused, and the nine factories in Penglai went on strike as a result. A committee of the Manchester Textile Federation passed a resolution advocating that if the labor unrest is not resolved immediately, the famous factories in the federation should be closed on the 17th. If this action is implemented, 200,000 workers will be unemployed. It is heard that the Lancashire cotton mills are planning to dismiss all textile workers due to the strike in Penglai. If this is realized, the number of unemployed workers will be 500,000. It is now heard that the negotiations to mediate the dispute have reached a deadlock, with no meetings between the two sides, and no plans for future meetings. The textile workers' strike is even more serious than the coal miners' strike.</p>
<p>Outside of Britain, the Ruhr coal mines in Germany have also experienced unrest due to wage reduction issues. The mine owners want to reduce wages by 38%, while the miners only agree to a 4%. Although it was arbitrated by the government, it has not yet been resolved. In the United States, the unemployment problem in agricultural areas has led to large numbers of farmers attacking cities and calling for food. There are also hundreds of thousands of homeless people in the streets of New York organizing demonstrations to demand improvements in the status quo. The situation is also very serious.</p>

<p>In One Year of the Past Year</p>
<p>1,100 Banks Closed</p>
<p>21,000 Companies Bankrupted</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd Dispatch: Nine more small banks in various parts of the United States closed yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th Dispatch: An investigation into the failure of the United Bank has now begun. It is estimated that the bank's debts total about 200 million yuan. Many of the depositors are middle-class people in New York. The Chief Justice stated that the general public has many complaints about the former directors of the bank and questioned why the New York State Bank Supervisor allowed the bank to name itself United, leading simple-minded people to believe it was a government bank. The directors of the bank said that the bank's failure was due to the interference of the Communist Party. Before the bank closed its doors, someone in New York warned depositors by phone to withdraw their deposits quickly.</p>
<p>New York News: The continuous closure of banks in the United States in 1930 was an unprecedented event in the United States. About 1,100 banks closed, with losses amounting to $100 million. At the end of the year, this situation became increasingly dangerous, with several banks closing daily. In Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, and Virginia, seven banks closed on the same day. In Arkansas, nearly 100 banks closed in one month last year, setting the worst record. In addition, the number of bankruptcies of commercial companies also set a new record, reaching 21,712 in eleven months, with losses amounting to $160 million. (World)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Indian Round Table Conference <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Expected to Conclude Within Ten Days</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - At today's meeting of the Federal Structure Committee, British Conservative representative Mr. Hoare stated that he could only adopt an unconstrained attitude towards the issue of responsibility for the federal administrative organs. India is now undertaking two major experiments: provincial autonomy and an all-India federation. He would not comment on the central government until the details of the federation plan are more complete than they are today. Liberal representative Lord Reading stated that he agreed with the idea of a responsible government in India, but it must be accompanied by sufficient guarantees to ensure that the government can adequately safeguard the interests of all parties. Indian representative Sapru had proposed a cabinet that is jointly responsible to the legislature, with the departments of national defense and foreign affairs being handled by senior officials appointed by the Governor-General of India. He (Reading) also believed that the Governor-General should have a special power to maintain law and order and to veto any plan passed by the legislature. Conservative Hoare also stated that India is currently unable to defend itself and relies solely on the British army, which can only be controlled by the British government. If there is a Minister of National Defense in the cabinet, how will his responsibility to the British monarch be reconciled with the responsibility of other cabinet members to the legislature? For the sake of ethnic minorities, the Governor-General should retain his special powers. The Indian cabinet will not be a complete cabinet as understood by the British. If the Governor-General is not an effective head of the executive government, how can he exercise the powers reserved to him? Reuters has learned that the reports of the various subcommittees will be submitted by the end of next week, so the Indian Round Table Conference may conclude on January 21st. Most representatives will return to India on the 24th.</p>

<p>Reuter's, New York, 4th - The number of food seekers is increasing daily in the United States. In the streets of New York, there are hundreds of thousands of vagrants without jobs or food. The Communist Party is active in organizing demonstrations demanding improvement of the current situation.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 6th - Senator Hefflin raised the issue of unemployment and hardship in the agricultural areas of the United States in the Senate today, saying that the situation is critical. If remedies are not provided soon, a revolution will occur. In Arkansas, a large number of farmers have recently attacked cities, shouting for food to save them from starvation. If Congress does not pass the bill to lend 150 million dollars to poor farmers, he will obstruct various government proposals.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - The number of registered unemployed people in Britain reached 2.643 million today. This is a new record.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 11th - The Lancashire cotton industry strike became more serious yesterday as the Burnley cotton mills began to lay off workers, including 25,000 weavers. Negotiations to resolve the dispute have reached a stalemate. There are currently no meetings, nor any plans for meetings. Reuter's, London, 5th - British cotton mills plan to increase the number of looms managed by each weaver. The weavers are unwilling to accept this. Representatives from both sides met in Manchester on the 2nd, but failed to reach an agreement. This morning, Burnley weavers went on strike to oppose the mills' new system of increasing the number of looms they manage. It is estimated that 3,500 people have been laid off from nine mills that have closed.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - Lancashire cotton mills may lay off all textile workers due to the Burnley nine mills strike. If this action is implemented, the number of unemployed workers will reach 500,000. The Burnley mill owners now state that if the strikers do not return to work by next Monday, the mills will dismiss the workers. The executive committee of the British Cotton Textile Industry Federation supports the actions of the Burnley mill owners and has notified all mills in the federation to prepare to close.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 9th - The management committee of the Manchester Cotton Spinning and Weaving Association unanimously passed a resolution today stating that if the dispute over increasing the number of looms managed by weavers is not resolved immediately, all mills in the association should be closed on January 17th. This action will leave 200,000 workers unemployed.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 9th - The meeting between representatives of mine owners and miners in Cardiff has now broken down because the miners' representatives cannot agree that the independent chairman of the new mediation committee has the right to resolve the issue of wage cuts, holding the view that the issue of wage cuts should be resolved by both parties themselves. Both mine owners and miners have accepted the invitation of the Minister of Trade, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, to meet with mining experts in London on Monday. The South Wales coal region will be shut down for at least another week because even if the two parties agree on terms in London, they must still be approved by representatives from all locations before work can resume.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 3rd - 160,000 miners in South Wales oppose the mine owners' method of distributing working hours, and the mine owners are also firmly unwilling to concede. Although the government sent officials on December 31st to mediate and ordered both parties to reopen negotiations, it was ultimately ineffective. Therefore, the miners' union ordered South Wales miners to stop working from January 1st. It is expected that the miners will soon resume work because the union's funds are insufficient and shops are unwilling to extend credit. The mediation committee held a meeting this afternoon, but the miners still firmly opposed the mine owners' proposal, leading to the breakdown of the meeting. The government is now intervening. The Prime Minister, Minister of Labor, and mining experts are scheduled to meet with representatives of the miners in London on the 5th to discuss matters.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 5th - Kirk, the secretary of the Miners' Federation, stated that the miners are currently hoping that the government will take action. If the government does not take action, the government's days are numbered. If the South Wales labor dispute is not resolved soon, there may be serious developments nationwide. After the Minister of Labor and mining experts met with the miners' representatives today, the authorities announced that they have summoned the mine owners' representatives to London tomorrow to present everything to the Minister of Labor so that the Ministry can submit a detailed report to the cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Interest Rate Reduction by American and French Banks <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Aiming to Curb the Inflow of Funds</p>
<p>No Progress Seen in British-French Expert Meeting</p>
<p>President of the Bank of China in America Expresses::</p>
<p>Opinions on Currency System Issues</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 3rd - After the New York Federal Reserve Bank reduced interest rates, the French Bank also reduced interest rates to 2%. This is part of a cooperative plan between the United States and France, as the inflow of cash into the United States and France has created a gold shortage elsewhere. Now, reducing interest rates is intended to prevent the inflow of cash. This plan is the result of talks between the heads of the central banks of Britain, the United States, and France. Financial experts from Britain and France are currently meeting in Paris, and further developments are expected. Some have suggested that the United States and France can work to increase outward lending in order to release cash and put Britain in a better position to adjust its industry.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Paris, 10th - The Paris Morning Post states that British and French experts recently met in Paris to discuss the cash issue, but no agreement has been reached. Although France has reduced its bank interest rate to 2% in order to curb the inflow of funds into Paris, the Bank of England, for the sake of its reputation, is unwilling to increase the interest rate to 4%. British financiers want to convene a comprehensive accounting conference to discuss the gold issue, while France prefers direct talks. As the proposal to convene a conference was not established, the British representatives issued a report requesting the Bank for International Settlements to handle the matter. However, another newspaper said that the British-French talks seem to have dispelled dangerous illusions and established a basis for cooperation in order to restore economic activity and better financial understanding. The newspaper also stated that the Young Plan should not be modified, and a systematic method should be established to prevent the overflow of funds, which lies in adjusting interest rates to suit the current situation of the British market.</p>
<p>Reuter's, New York, 8th - Pei Tsu-yi, President of the Bank of China in Shanghai, said in a speech to the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers yesterday that the adoption of the gold standard by all countries except China is one of the reasons for the global economic depression. He said that if the currency and financial system are purely backed by gold for a long time, it will inevitably lead to the collapse of the world's financial system because the amount of money owned by each country is not enough to maintain commerce or pay for banknotes. If the world uses more silver as subsidiary currency, the world's silver market can be established on a more solid foundation, and economic depression will not occur so easily. New gold mines have not been discovered. If the annual gold production is not assisted by silver, it will not be able to maintain the expansion of commerce. As for American goods in China, the Chinese may have to pay a higher price due to the low price of silver, but Americans must also greatly reduce prices in order to cater to the Chinese market. The reason why Americans have to make more sacrifices is only to maintain the prestige of gold, their sole standard of value. He is not advocating the use of bimetallism, but feels that the rise in the price of silver can help the recovery of world commerce.</p>

<p>Reuter's, London, 3rd - The Ministry of Finance statistics show that revenue for the nine months ending at the end of December is short by 180 million pounds. In the same period last year, there was a shortfall of 16.9 million pounds. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden had predicted a net surplus of over 2 million pounds in the fiscal year ending at the end of March 1931. The current shortfall is so large that the budget outlook is not good.</p>

<p>Government Orders Arbitration</p>
<p>Labor and Management at a Standstill</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 10th - The Ruhr coal mine labor dispute came to an end today. The arbitration order organized according to emergency orders has ruled that wages be reduced by 6%. Newspapers speculate that after the coal mine wage cuts are resolved, not only can coal prices fall, but steel prices can also be reduced by 8% soon. The steel industry is scheduled to meet next Wednesday to discuss price reductions.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 10th - A recent trend of wage cuts has occurred in the coal mining industry in the Ruhr region of Germany. The mine owners are demanding a wage cut of 8%, while the miners say that the wage cut should not exceed 4% at most. The two sides are at a standstill, causing strikes and Communist Party activities. The President of Germany used his special powers to grant the authorities to arbitrators in order to quickly resolve the labor dispute. The arbitrators have now ruled on a compromise solution, that is, a 6% wage cut, but the mine owners immediately expressed their opposition, and the social miners' union also decided to advise its members to reject the government's arbitration.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Detailed Account of Mo Teh-hui's Return to China <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Returned to Harbin on the evening of the 29th at 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Entered the Central Hospital on the 30th</p>
<p>Made a Statement to the Reporters</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - Mo Teh-hui, the Chinese Plenipotentiary Representative to the Sino-Russian Conference, returned to Harbin on December 29th at 8:40 PM. Those who returned with him included Secretary Wang Yin-chuan, Zhang Ming-che, attendant Cui Shu-yan, and scribe Sun Su-chen, as well as Mo's wife. The special train they were traveling on, along with the special train that had been dispatched the day before to meet them by various important people in Harbin, consisted of a total of nine cars. The first car was the locomotive, the second and third cars were the baggage car and dining car, the fourth and fifth cars were first-class two-berth sleeping cars for the Eastern Railway Department Chiefs who were dispatched from Harbin to meet them, the sixth, seventh, and eighth cars were official cars for Mo's attendants and Li Shao-geng (Acting President of the Eastern Railway) and others, and the ninth official car was for Mo and his wife. At 8:40 PM on the evening of the 29th, the special train arrived at Harbin Central Station. As the military band played loudly, thousands of Chinese and foreign dignitaries and representatives of legal entities gathered on the platform. In addition to each business firm sending one representative to welcome him, there were also people from Tianjia Distillery outside the port, and the masses from the Binjiang Education Center and Fu'er, who lined up to greet him, holding horizontal banners with slogans such as "Welcome Plenipotentiary Mo's Triumphant Return" and "Welcome Plenipotentiary Mo Who Labored for the Country" and flags with slogans written on them. The Russian dignitaries who arrived included Eastern Railway Council Russian Deputy Chairman Yemushanov, Railway Bureau Russian Director Rudyi, Russian Consul-General in Harbin Melnikov, Council Member Danilevsky, and others, totaling more than ten people. The Chinese who arrived included Zhao Jin-lin, Chief of Staff of the Eastern Railway Protection Army Headquarters, Ding Chao, Garrison Commander of Binjiang, Bao Lian, Director of the Special Zone Political Affairs Department, Zhou Shou-yi, Director of the Education Department, Ying Zhen-fu, Director of the Land Bureau, Jia Wen-qi, Deputy Director of the Special Police Department, Yu Jing-tao, Deputy Director of the Railway Police Department, Wang Li-tang, Council Member of the Navigation Bureau, Wang Shi-ze, Manager, and others, totaling more than a hundred people. Order on the platform was maintained by the Special Police Security Brigade and the Railway Police Guard Squad. All staff members of the Eastern Railway Governor's Office wore usher sashes to assist. After the special train stopped, the crowd gathered under the first special car. Mo stepped down from the car, and the welcoming people waved flags and cheered. Mo nodded in response. After getting out of the car, he entered the VIP room and shook hands with the welcoming people to express his deep feelings. After being seated, tea and fruit were served. Negotiator Zhong Yu rose and delivered a welcoming speech. Mo gave an impromptu speech, which Secretary Zhang Ming-che translated into Russian. He said, "I am honored to be welcomed by everyone at the station today. I am ashamed that I have been dispatched to Russia for eight months, which is not a short time, and I have not been able to fulfill my responsibilities and aspirations after several formal meetings. Fortunately, the past misunderstandings between China and Russia have now been completely understood by each other, and the hope for permanent peace has been completely realized. The conference has now entered a normal track, and continued progress in the future can naturally be smooth. I should have visited you all in person to present everything in detail, but because I have a cold and rheumatism, I plan to go to the hospital temporarily for treatment and plan to go to Beijing in ten days. After I return, I will ask for your advice again." After the speech, they all drank a glass of champagne, took a photo, and dispersed. After leaving the station, Mo did not immediately return home, but first took a car to the Jile Temple in Qinjia Gang to pay respects to the coffin of his deceased wife for a long time. He did not return home until 9:00 PM. On the morning of the 30th, Mo attended the graduation ceremony of the Eastern Railway Rotary Training Institute and gave a lecture. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, he entered the Central Hospital for treatment and published a notice in the newspaper completely declining all social engagements. He is scheduled to leave on the 5th day of the New Year to first go to Liaoning, then to Dalian Tanggangzi Hot Springs to bathe in the spring to treat his skin disease. He will arrive in the capital around the 15th. For the convenience of the journey, he may go by sea. When Mo's special train arrived in Chita, Russia on the 27th, Harbin had already received a telegram. Li Shao-geng, Acting President of the Eastern Railway, Council Member Shen Rui-lin, Fan Qi-guang, Supervisor Zhang Shu, Kim Rong-gui, Counselor of the Governor's Office, Li Xi-zhen, Director of the Medical Affairs Department, Su Wen-zhong, Director of the Legal Affairs Department, Wang Huan-wen, Director of the Pension Affairs Department, Uze-sheng, Director of the Eastern Railway Library, Zhong Yu, Diplomatic Envoy, and others, along with reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than thirty people, took three cars together at 4:35 PM to meet him in Manchuria. At 9:30 PM on the evening of the 28th, the car Mo was traveling on arrived at the national border from Russia. Many soldiers, police, merchants, and civilians welcomed him at the station. Mo got out of the car and rested in the dining room, chatting with the welcoming people. At that time, there were many Japanese reporters who wanted to see Mo and talk, but Secretary Wang Yin-chuan met with them on his behalf. That evening at 11:21, the special train departed from Manchuria Station. It did not stop at small stations along the way, but people welcomed him at the major stations. Mo originally intended to return to Harbin at around 10:00 AM on the 30th. When he passed Ang'angxi Station on the 30th, he would get off the train to meet with Wan Fu-lin in the provincial capital of Heilongjiang. However, when the train arrived at Boketu Station, Dong Ji-wu, the secretary specially sent by the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and Wu Zhong-quan, the adjutant, greeted him on behalf of Wan, informing him that Wan had left the province to inspect the army. Since Wan was not in the province, Mo stopped his advance. Therefore, the special train arrived in Harbin half a day earlier than scheduled. When the special train passed Ang'angxi at noon on the 29th, the reporters boarded Mo's special car to talk with him. The questions and answers were as follows: Question: Your Excellency, you have been sent by the Central Government to the Soviet Union for eight months, and you have finally been able to bring the conference into a normal track and proceed smoothly, greatly enhancing the prestige of the Party and the country. There have been various rumors about your return to China this time. What is your mission and when do you plan to go to Russia again? Answer: The Central Government's strategy for the Sino-Soviet Conference at the beginning of the trip was to resolve the Eastern Railway issue. However, due to the needs of the times, the scope of the conference was expanded, and the issues of commerce and diplomatic relations were also discussed. Therefore, I had to return to China to ask the Central Government for specific plans for resuming trade and diplomatic relations so that I could follow them when I went to Russia again to continue the conference. On the one hand, I have been sent to Russia for eight months, and I have held more than 20 formal meetings and informal talks. Although the delegation has reported the situation of the conference to the Central Government at any time, the exchange of documents and telegrams is still not detailed enough. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity to return to China to ask for instructions, I plan to report the negotiation process to the Central Government in a more systematic way. In addition, on a personal note, because I have been in Moscow for a long time, I have suffered from rheumatism, and my old skin disease has recently recurred. Because I am often itchy and cannot sleep well at night, I plan to take this opportunity to return to China for treatment. This time, I am asking for a leave of one and a half months, but the round trip takes a lot of time. It is estimated that it will be difficult to return to the Russian capital in the short time of 45 days. At that time, I may have to continue the leave for a few days. But if the Central Government instructs the plan for Russia as soon as possible, I will not delay public affairs. Besides, there is no other mission. Question: The other statements are misunderstandings. Question: Why has the Sino-Russian Conference been delayed for several months? According to various sources, it is said that the conference was suspended due to the dispute between the two sides over the Boli Record in the first few months. Now that the conference is continuing, what is the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Boli Record? Answer: China and the Soviet Union have had very different views on the Boli Record from the beginning. After I went to Russia, the Soviet Union insisted that my country recognize this case, but now it has become a thing of the past. Question: How far have the three issues of the Eastern Railway, commerce, and diplomatic relations progressed so far? Answer: There are two steps in the progress of the three cases of the Eastern Railway, commerce, and diplomatic relations: 1. Formal meetings and negotiations have been announced on the establishment of specialized committees, the allocation of committee members, etc. 2. Informal negotiations have been conducted many times, and both sides have a considerable understanding of various issues, so the opinions are quite close. However, this kind of negotiation is not yet at the stage of publication because it is an informal negotiation. Question: In your observation, is the Soviet Union sincere in this conference? Answer: In principle, this conference is for the mutual benefit of the two countries, so there is no difference in the concepts of the two sides. Since the goals of each other are focused on the interests of both sides, there is naturally no difference in what they hope for. Question: Which item does the Soviet Union advocate to discuss first among the three issues of the Eastern Railway, commerce, and diplomatic relations? Answer: According to conference practice, important issues should be the starting point of discussion. All past disputes between China and the Soviet Union have arisen from the Eastern Railway. Therefore, in terms of nature, the Eastern Railway is the most important of the three issues in this conference. This is the same feeling on both sides and is not a problem. Question: Your Excellency, you have been sent to Russia for eight months. What impressions have you gained? Answer: The Soviet Union is a newly emerging country. Everything is in the creation period. Although the people's lives are not very prosperous, the construction is indeed progressing rapidly, and the spirit of unity and hard work from top to bottom is not to be despised. If the Five-Year Plan is successful in the future, its economy will occupy an important position in the world. Question: When will Your Excellency arrive in Beijing after arriving in Harbin? Or will you have to stay a few more days? Answer: After arriving in Harbin, I plan to see a doctor first and then go to Liaoning and Beijing in ten days. When I arrive in Liaoning, I may have to go to Dalian Tanggangzi Hot Springs for a day or two of recuperation. However, the illness is a personal matter and is not very serious, so I will not delay public affairs because of this. Question: What are Your Excellency's views on the Eastern Railway after returning to Harbin? Answer: The freight rate should be reduced immediately in order to encourage transportation and increase revenue. In addition to layoffs and salary reductions, special attention should be paid to material procurement, engineering construction, and other items to reduce costs. As for the materials used by the Eastern Railway, such as coal and timber, the priority should be given to the railway's own forest farms and coal mines to avoid losses. This is just a temporary remedy. As for the fundamental proposal, there is another detailed plan. On the same day, Mo talked for a long time, but many of them were diplomatic secrets and could not be disclosed. The reporter also asked whether the Eastern Railway team of the Sino-Soviet Conference would continue as usual after his return to China. He said that it would be temporarily suspended and would be held at the same time as the other two teams after he asked for instructions and returned to Russia. (December 30)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Postponement of the Implementation of Abolishing the Likin Tax in the Northeast <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Commander Zhang sent a telegram ordering a three-month extension</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence - The National Government recently issued an order to all provinces to implement the abolition of the likin tax and similar likin-like transportation surcharges on January 1st of the 20th year. After receiving this order, the Northeast provinces had to consider how to make up for the sudden loss of a large amount of revenue due to the fiscal relations of each province being self-sufficient, and the implementation procedures also had to be planned in the long term. After Commander Zhang discussed with the Central Government to request an extension of three months for preparation, he telegraphed the Northeast provincial governments from Tianjin on the Ma day of last month, saying, "Previously, the deadline for the abolition of the likin tax was urgent. I telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on Qiao day to request an extension of three months. I have now received a reply telegram from Minister Song of the Ministry stating that I have been informed of the Qiao Lei case regarding the three-month extension of the abolition of the likin tax in the northern provinces. I have asked the National Government to meet and inform you. I am sending a special telegram to inform you." Therefore, none of the Northeast provinces implemented the abolition of the likin tax on New Year's Day. They are now waiting for Zhang's return to the East to convene a giant meeting to determine the plan. (January 5)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Northeast China Will Realize Water-Land Intermodal Transport <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Goods shipped from Tianjin can directly reach Harbin</p>
<p>Resisting the Manipulation of the South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - After the four railways in the Northeast implemented intermodal transport, goods from Tianjin and Shanghai can now be directly transported to Liaoning and Jilin. However, goods from northern Manchuria have always been gathered and distributed in Harbin. Although the four railways have been transported to Jidong and Heilongjiang by intermodal transport, they still have to go through the South Manchuria Railway operated by Japan and the Chinese Eastern Railway jointly operated by China and Russia. The freight rates of both railways are in gold, and the rates are surprisingly high, resulting in prices in northern Manchuria being more than twice as high as those in southern Manchuria, especially for salt. Last winter, Huang Zhen-gang, a shipping merchant on the Songhua River, proposed the establishment of a shipping consortium to expand shipping routes and compete with Russian merchants by advancing into the Heilongjiang and Ussuri rivers in a unified manner to avoid competition. This matter has now been initiated and is expected to succeed soon. However, ships that go downstream have deeper drafts. It is planned to open up new routes for ships with shallower drafts. Before the New Year, the Shipping Association sent personnel to the Qiqihar-Taonan Railway to investigate. The railway sent engineers and technicians to cooperate in surveying at the confluence of the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers. It was measured that the riverbank at this location is flat and wide, with natural stone cliffs and a water depth of 11 units at normal times, which can accommodate shallow-draft steamships. If a branch line of the Qiqihar-Taonan Railway is extended from the Dalin line, it will be about 40 li long and can directly reach the river mouth. Then domestic products can be transported through the intermodal transport of the four railways without having to be transferred by the South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway to reach the Nenjiang River mouth and then transported by ship to Harbin. If the goods are shipped from Tianjin, the route is Beining, Datong, Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Angangxi, and the upper reaches of the Songhua River. It is estimated that the freight can be saved by 20%, and the salt alone can save 2 million yuan per year. The freight of the South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway and the upper reaches of the Songhua River can increase the freight by 2 million yuan. Other goods have not yet been calculated. The time can be shortened by five days. Therefore, after the intermodal transport of water and land is realized, it is not only the financial resources of the Songhua River Customs that will increase, but also the national economy and the people's livelihood will also benefit greatly. This matter has been approved by the Northeast Transportation Committee. In the future, the Taonan-Angangxi Railway authorities and the Songhua River Shipping Association will jointly discuss it. Recently, the Songhua River Shipping Association has launched Gao Wen-xuan, Sheng Yin-xiang, Zheng Zi-zhan, Ma Yu-liang, Wang Ming-shan, and Liu Xi-san as audit freight committee members to discuss the freight rules from the Nenjiang River mouth to Harbin and submit them to the Taonan-Angangxi Railway for approval in order to implement them.

<p>That is, the national economy and the people's livelihood also have great benefits. This matter has been approved by the Northeast Transportation Committee, and in the future, the Tao'an Road authorities and the Songhua River Shipping Association will jointly discuss it.

<h3 id="e64">Tan Daoyuan Defeats Zhu and Mao at Zhongcun <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>All Departments in Jiangxi Ordered Not to Rest on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Zhang's Division Engages in Fierce Battle with Communist Bandits in Donggu</p>
<p>Tan's Division Kills Several Thousand Communist Bandits in Zhongcun</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Lu Diping, Director of the Nanchang Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Route Army, issued a general attack order on Zhu and Mao's bandit gangs on the 30th of the year's end. He also ordered all units suppressing bandits in Jiangxi not to rest on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day in order to eliminate the communist bandits as soon as possible. Therefore, while the whole country rested and celebrated the New Year, the bandit suppression troops continued to fight the communist bandits in the border areas of Xingguo, Ningdu, Jishui, Ji'an, and Yongfeng. The fighting was extremely fierce. According to recent news from the front, the left wing of the bandit suppression troops, Zhu Shaoliang's Mao Bingwen Division, advanced towards Ningdu after recovering Guangchang on December 24th of the past year. The right wing, Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai's divisions, advanced towards Xingguo after capturing Taihe and Wan'an, adopting a pincer movement encirclement strategy. At the same time, the central route, the Ninth Route Army's Zhang Huizan, Gong Bingfan, and Tan Daoyuan's divisions, launched attacks from Yongfeng, Ji'an, and Le'an through Donggu to the south, targeting Zhu and Mao's main base, Gulonggang (located at the border of Xingguo County, Ningdu and Yudu). The communist bandits, fearing encirclement from all sides, made a desperate gamble. Zhu De's fake Fourth Army, Huang Gonglue's fake Eighth Army, Mao Zedong's fake Twelfth Army, Chen Yi's fake Twenty-second Army, and small gangs led by Hu Zhusheng, Li Shaojiu, Duan Yuequan, and others, totaling about 70,000 to 80,000 men with guns, launched an attack on the 18th Division of the government army on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Zhang Huizan, the division commander, Dai Yue, the deputy division commander, and Wang Jiejun, the 53rd brigade commander, personally led their troops to the front line to supervise the battle. They fought a bloody battle with the bandits at the border of Yongfeng, Xingguo, and Jishui, charging back and forth in melee combat, which was unprecedentedly fierce. However, on the 2nd and 3rd of this month, a heavy fog suddenly descended, making it impossible to distinguish directions in the high mountains and ridges. Many government soldiers were unfamiliar with the terrain, while the communist bandits were very familiar with the terrain, especially those from Yudu and Xingguo, and the peasants who had been transformed into bandits acted as guides. Therefore, the bandit army launched a large-scale offensive, and the 52nd and 53rd brigades of the 18th Division were surrounded by the communist bandits, struggling to break through. The Gong and Tan divisions, which were supposed to provide reinforcements, were also unable to reach them on time due to the heavy fog and unfamiliarity with the terrain. After running out of ammunition, the Wang and Dai brigades fought with bayonets, suffering heavy casualties and losses. There were also reports that Donggu had been retaken by the bandits and that Division Commander Zhang and Brigade Commanders Wang and Dai were missing. However, a key figure in the Ninth Route Army headquarters stated that the 18th Division had been ambushed by the communist bandits but had only suffered minor losses, and that the outside reports were not true. In this battle, Zhang's division also killed countless communist bandit fake division commanders, regimental commanders, battalion and company commanders, and bandit soldiers. Later, Tan Daoyuan's 50th Division rushed from Le'an and encountered the communist bandits in Zhongcun, killing several thousand bandits and seizing more than 2,000 guns, defeating the communist bandits. The communist bandits retreated to Ningdu. The 18th Division also returned to the Jishui area on the 3rd for reorganization. In addition to ordering the Gong and Tan divisions to continue their attacks and advance, coordinating with the 6th and 19th routes, and setting a deadline to break through Gulonggang, Lu Diping, fearing that the communist bandits would attempt to riot during the New Year, ordered the garrison headquarters to be on strict alert in order to consolidate the security of the rear of Nanchang. All game venues were closed on the 4th, and the independent 14th brigade, under Liu Yi, was stationed to defend the city walls. Therefore, the provincial capital was very peaceful. (6th)</p>

<p>Wang and Han's Divisions Reorganized into Class B Divisions</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Defense and Transportation</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: All circles in Xuzhou celebrated the New Year with great enthusiasm after the military had been pacified. The troops stationed in Xuzhou also implemented a scaled-down reorganization during the New Year period. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Year's Celebration: On New Year's Eve of the 19th year, Xuzhou experienced heavy snowfall. On New Year's Day, the weather cleared up. At 9:00 AM, all circles held a celebration meeting at the public club, attended by approximately 10,000 people. Liu Tianzhan, Chairman of the County Reorganization Committee, presided over the meeting. Representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as representatives from the 7th and 52nd divisions, delivered speeches. In the afternoon, entertainment activities were held, including Beijing opera performances by the Zhengfeng Society and new dramas by the Mingshi School. National flags were hung throughout the city, and slogans were posted everywhere. Businesses were closed for five days, from New Year's Day to the 5th. The common people performed dramas such as flower boats, stilt walkers, and lion dances, parading through the streets, which was very lively. It was also decided that all celebrations and entertainment activities during the lunar New Year would be prohibited in order to promote the national calendar.</p>
<p>Military Reorganization: The 7th and 52nd divisions stationed in Xuzhou were reorganized into Class B divisions, each division consisting of two brigades and six regiments. The reorganization began on New Year's Day. The 7th Division originally had three brigades, the 19th, 20th, and 21st, each brigade consisting of two regiments. It is now reorganized into two brigades, each brigade consisting of three regiments. Chen Xueshun, the commander of the 20th Brigade, was relieved of his command and will be assigned to another position. The two regiments under his command were incorporated into the 19th and 21st brigades, respectively. The 52nd Division originally had two brigades, each brigade consisting of three regiments. Zhang Zhongdiao's 154th Brigade has already completed its reorganization in Xuzhou. Sun Changjun's 155th Brigade has been temporarily unable to reorganize due to its deployment to Jiangxi to suppress the communist bandits. Both divisions are being reorganized according to the Class B division organization promulgated by the central government. The total number of officers and soldiers in each company is 109. The wartime stretcher-bearer platoon and transportation platoon have been eliminated. The special service battalion has been changed to a supply battalion, and the communications squad has been merged into the engineer battalion. The units directly under the division, in addition to the division headquarters and various offices, include two brigades, a artillery battalion, a supply battalion, an engineer battalion, and a cavalry company. However, the 52nd Division still retains a supplementary regiment pending reorganization.</p>
<p>Defense Situation: The defense of Xuzhou City was originally the responsibility of Zhang Zhongdiao's 154th Brigade of the 52nd Division. As of today (8th), it has been changed to the responsibility of Zeng Wanzhong's 19th Brigade of the 7th Division. Wang Jun, the commander of the 7th Division, went to Beijing to visit Chiang before the New Year and has not yet returned. Han Deqin, the commander of the 52nd Division, went to Beijing on the 2nd to visit Gu Zhutong and returned to Xuzhou on the 5th. It was heard that Wang had telegraphed the Third Army Headquarters in Xuzhou, informing them of the order to abolish the Jinpu Garrison Command and reorganize it into the Jinpu Police Headquarters to handle garrison affairs. There are rumors that the entire 52nd Division will be transferred to Jiangxi to suppress the communist bandits. However, after the reorganization of the various units, the headquarters has sent personnel to Xuzhou to verify the numbers. It seems that they will not be transferred until after the verification.</p>
<p>Transportation Situation: There have been no changes in the time schedules for the Liaopu Railway, the Blue Steel Car, and the express trains on the Jinpu Railway. The Longhai Railway has recently stipulated the train schedules for each section. Between Xuzhou and Luoyang, there will be three special express trains per week, leaving Xuzhou every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8:00 AM and arriving in Luoyang every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 8:20 PM. Between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, there will be daily passenger trains, leaving Xuzhou every morning at 10:00 AM and arriving in Zhengzhou every evening at 6:03 PM. Between Xuzhou and Haizhou, there will be daily passenger trains, leaving Xuzhou every morning at 8:40 AM and arriving in Haizhou every evening at 6:04 PM. All trains on the Longhai Railway connect with the trains on the Jinpu Railway, making transportation in all directions extremely convenient. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">What's Happening in Jinan During the New Year <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Han Fuju Returns Vehicles to Various Railways</p>
<p>Jinan Municipal Government Orders Abolishment</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The New Year of the 20th year of the Republic has passed swiftly amidst enthusiastic celebrations from all sectors. There are two major issues in Jinan during this New Year that are worthy of recording. One is Han Fuju's return of vehicles to various railways, and the other is the Jinan Municipal Government's order to abolish itself. Regarding the return of vehicles, the Ministry of Railways sent Qian Tangchao (Longhai Railway), Tang Dehua (Jinpu Railway), and Wu Shangzhi (Jiaoji Railway) as supervisors to oversee the return of vehicles by various military units. In addition, various railways sent personnel, including Zhu Quan (Secretary, Jinpu Railway), Wei Xinping (Section Chief, Jiaoji Railway), Chen Qitang (Section Chief, Pinghan Railway), Jin Jingshan (Longhai Railway), and Lv Yunxun (Section Chief, Longhai Railway). Han Fuju appointed Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the Public Relations Office, to be responsible for handling the return of vehicles. After Zhang consulted with the Ministry of Railways, it was decided that one locomotive and thirty passenger and freight cars would be temporarily retained for the Third Route Army's military transport, which had not yet been completed. The remaining locomotives and passenger and freight cars would be returned to the various railways. By the 4th, all procedures for the return of vehicles had been prepared. On that day at noon, Han Fuju and Zhang Lianjia hosted a banquet at the Shi Qinyan Hotel for the personnel from the Ministry of Railways and various railways who were handling the return of vehicles, as well as Lv Zhenting (Section Chief, Jinpu Railway), Shun Qiguang (Station Chief, Jinan Station), Tang Weicheng, Liu Dide (Section Chief, Jiaoji Railway), Du Baotian, and Kong Guangxun (Station Chief, Jinan Station), among others. The banquet was very convivial. After the banquet, the vehicle return was carried out. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways issued receipts to the two railways, which were then distributed to other railways. A total of eight locomotives and one hundred fifty-nine passenger and freight cars were returned. The detailed numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Returned to the Jinpu Railway: (I) Six locomotives, including Pinghan Railway No. 611, No. 203, No. 623, Zhongxing Company No. 56, Jinpu Railway No. 30, and Jiaoji Railway No. 70. (II) One hundred thirty-two passenger and freight cars. Those returned at Jinan Station totaled two hundred and five, including twenty from the Pinghan Railway, twenty-eight from the Jiaoji Railway, four from the Bianluo Railway, thirteen from the Jinpu Railway, fourteen from the Beining Railway, ten from the Pingsui Railway, three from the Longhai Railway, four from the Daoqing Railway, and two from the Zhongxing Company. Those returned at Xinzhuang totaled twenty-one, including seven from the Pinghan Railway, two from the Pingsui Railway, five from the Jinpu Railway, two from the Huningyong Railway, two from the Jiaoji Railway, one from the Beining Railway, one from the Bianluo Railway, and one from the Longhai Railway. Those returned at Dezhou Station totaled three, including one from the Pingsui Railway, one from the Jinpu Railway, and one from the Jiaoji Railway.

(II) Thirty passenger and freight cars, including nine from the Pinghan Railway, seven from the Longhai Railway, six from the Pingfeng Railway, four from the Pingsui Railway, two from the Jinpu Railway, one from the Bianluo Railway, and one from the Daoqing Railway.</p>
<p>Regarding the Jinan Municipal Government's abolishment, the reason was financial difficulty after the abolition of likin. However, the accidental burning of explosives during the burning of drugs by the government on December 29th of last year, which resulted in the death and injury of a large number of civil servants, was also a reason for the abolition. After the incident occurred, the public and various party and government agencies were deeply dissatisfied with the municipal government and the public security bureau. The punishment of those responsible was the focus of attention from all sides. The provincial government also believed that the matter was of great importance. Although Mayor Chen Weixin and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Zunwu were not intentional, they could not shirk their responsibility for negligence. Therefore, on the 6th of this month, a clear order was issued to remove Mayor Chen Weixin from his post (after consultation with the authorities on the 8th, he was appointed as a provincial government advisor as a face-saving measure). Wang Zunwu, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, was transferred to the provincial government as an advisor. At the same time, because the municipal government had not made any achievements in the past year and was in extreme financial difficulty, it was decided to abolish the municipal government. The various bureaus under the municipal government, including the Public Security Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau, were all placed directly under the provincial government in order to facilitate administration. Wang Kai, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, was appointed to replace Wang Zunwu as the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Lianjia was appointed as the Director of the River Affairs Bureau. Wang and Zhang took office at 2:00 PM on the 6th. After receiving the order, the municipal government worked to hand over its affairs, with the section chiefs consulting with Xing Lanjie, the receiver appointed by the provincial government, on all matters. The notice of the abolishment of the municipal government is recorded below: "In accordance with the Provincial Government's Instruction No. 15, due to financial constraints after the abolition of likin, the Jinan Municipal Government is hereby abolished. All administrative affairs of the said government are to be merged into this government for concurrent management in order to save expenses. The various bureaus originally under the municipal government, which have specific responsibilities, shall continue to exist and be directly under the jurisdiction of this government. You may proceed directly to the relevant agencies to handle all administrative matters of this government relating to public security, health, social affairs, education, public works, finance, and land. This is hereby announced. January 1, 20th year of the Republic. Mayor Chen Weixin."</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Enthusiasm of Various Provinces in Celebrating New Year's Day <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Nanchang Communication: In order to expand the promotion of the national calendar and enthusiastically celebrate the founding of the Republic of China, the Nanchang All-Circles Celebration Preparatory Committee for the 20th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China was established. Representatives from the General Headquarters Second Propaganda Brigade, the Ninth Route Army Headquarters, the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and various industrial, commercial, and academic organizations served as preparatory committee members to carry out all activities. The committee originally intended to hold a citizens' assembly on New Year's Day, but after receiving a telegram from Lu Diping from the front lines, it was decided that during the period of bandit suppression, it was appropriate to share weal and woe with the refugees in the bandit areas and not to overspend. Therefore, it was changed to a representatives' assembly. On the morning of New Year's Day at 10:00 AM, a celebration meeting was held at the Provincial Party Department, attended by over a thousand representatives from all walks of life. At 7:00 PM, a lantern parade was held, which was extraordinarily lively. On the 2nd and 3rd, Beijing opera and new dramas were performed at the public stadium for two days. On the evening of the 4th, the mayor freely performed dragon dances and there were many flower lanterns. A large number of people watched the fireworks display at Donghu. As for the merchants and people, many closed their accounts at the end of the year and rested for three days from the 31st. The shops pasted couplets and hung lanterns in front of their doors to celebrate. (5th)</p>
<p>Fuzhou Fuzhou Communication: This year, various party and government agencies actively promoted the national calendar and promoted it. Therefore, the celebration of New Year's Day this year was very enthusiastic. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the same day, the party, government, military, police, business, academic, and women's circles of the provincial capital held a New Year's Day celebration meeting at Nanqiao. There were more than 130 organizations. The meeting started at 9:30 AM, with Gan Yun, the Propaganda Minister of the Provincial Guidance Committee, as the General Chairman.

At 2:00 PM, the Provincial and County Party Departments, the Provincial and County Governments, the Martial Law Headquarters, the Telegraph Bureau, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Water Public Security Bureau, the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, and the Society for the Promotion of National Goods, the Qingbai Review Society, the Xiaobai Xing Bao, the Customs Superintendent's Office, the Postal Administration, and other agencies and organizations gathered at Nanqiao. At 2:05 PM, they departed and paraded to Nantai, distributing the national calendar and various propaganda materials. The Xiamen aircraft also circled in the air at 2:00 PM, distributing slogans.

<h3 id="e68">The First Day of the Jiangsu Provincial Pacification Conference <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Divide into Groups to Review Proposals</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Pacification Conference was held yesterday (the 10th). The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 AM on the morning of the same day. Chairman Zhang Zhijiang performed the rituals. Zhang then reported the purpose of the conference, followed by speeches by Ma Yinbing and Ye Chucang. Finally, music was played and photos were taken, and the opening ceremony ended. After the opening ceremony, Zhang Zhijiang specially prepared seven tables of Chinese food to entertain the attending members and the press. Ye Chucang occupied the first seat in the central table, Ma Yinbing the second seat, Li Houji (guest) the third seat, Li Mingyang the fourth seat, Lu Changgeng the fifth seat, Liang Guanying the sixth seat, and Zhang Zhijiang the seventh seat. When the banquet was half over, Zhang Zhijiang stood up and said, "I am very happy to be gathered here with you today. I recently heard Chairman Ye say that he saw slogans promoting the welfare of the people in the streets and was truly afraid to accept them, but he dared not refuse to take responsibility for the people. In the cold weather, the gentlemen who have come to the meeting have not spared their precious time to gather together and express their great opinions. Isn't this for the benefit of the people? I, your humble brother, am in the position of host and have prepared a small meal to offer my respects." Ye then delivered a speech, and the host and guests were extremely congenial. After the banquet, they rested briefly and then began the meeting at approximately 3:00 PM. Forty-five people attended the meeting, and eleven people were present as observers. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting and performed the rituals. After reading the rules of the Pacification Conference, Chen Zhuoru, the Chief of Staff of the Governor's Office, reported on the pacification work and the recent important bandit situation in Jiangsu. Then, Lan Bohua (representative of Tongshan County), Huang Jialin (representative of Taixing), Shen Shaochang (representative of Haimen), and Wu Changkui (representative of Suqian) reported on the bandit situation in their respective counties. It was originally planned to continue discussing the proposals, but because the time for rest had arrived and there were many proposals, it was decided to divide into groups to review the proposals. The proposals were divided into five groups for review: clearing the countryside, self-defense, searching and suppressing, rehabilitation, and other. The members of each review group were appointed and will be discussed further after they are categorized in the days to come (11th).</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural and Mining Department was yesterday handed over by Director Qian Tianhe to the Construction Department for management. The affiliated institutions of the department include more than ten places such as agricultural, forestry, sericulture, fishery, animal husbandry, and cotton fields. Director Shi of the Construction Department changed the fourth cashier's section of the department to the fifth section, and the various agricultural and mining affairs are handled by the fourth section, which has now started working.</p>
<p>Since Zhejiang Province implemented the abolition of likin on January 1, the number of goods transported from the five stations of the Hangzhou city gate, Nanxing, Hangzhou Genshan, and Gongchen to Shanghai has increased several times. Every time the company's freight cars arrive in Hangzhou, the goods unloaded at the station pile up like mountains. As a general rule, the likin tax paid directly to the Finance Department by each company every ten days has now been stopped.</p>
<p>The draft of the Zhejiang Business Tax Collection Act contains 25 articles. The amount of tax payable by each industry listed in the act is enough to enrich the provincial treasury, but it is still doubtful whether each industry can afford to bear it. It has been learned that the silk industry guild estimates that the business tax will be 30 per mille, reaching about 400,000 yuan per year, which is less than 100,000 yuan different from the original voluntary donation. Adding in the consolidated tax, the silk industry will find it difficult to maintain the status quo. Four representatives have now been appointed to petition the Finance Department, stating the situation and requesting that the draft be revised to benefit the business.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously drafted six rules to ban competitive sales by businesses in various industries and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. It was decided that they would be implemented from the first day of this month. Currently, more than ten shops, including foreign goods and department stores, are not complying with the rules and are arbitrarily engaging in competitive sales. Yesterday, Pan Xieqing was sent to give them a warning first. If they still do not comply, the Municipal Government will be requested to strictly prohibit them (11th).</p>

<p>Bandits are Rampant Again in Qinshan Kongjia Que. The area of Qinshan Kongjia Que has always been a place where bandits emerge. Since the anti-smuggling team patrol boats were stationed in Kongjia Que last summer, they have been somewhat restrained. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, the bandit forces have become rampant again. Robbery and kidnapping occur frequently. On the night of December 30, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to the house of Sun Shuigeng, a farmer in Qianshan East. They broke into the house with torches and searched the house at will. Because there were no valuables, they tied up Shuigeng and his mother, beating them until their bodies were covered in injuries. On the night of the 31st, the families of Gao Caisheng and Maosheng, about half a mile north of Kongjia Que, were also robbed. They even kidnapped the five-month-old child of Caisheng and Fushan and asked for 3,000 yuan in foreign currency within three days to be sent to Tangjia Bridge. Also, on the evening of January 5th, bandits suddenly appeared in the houses of Zhu Yiyi and Ruizhi in Kongjia Quexi Shanzu. Dozens of people with guns held weapons in their hands. After arriving at the door, the bandits fired their guns as a warning. The wife of Yizhai, Mrs. Yu, who was nearly ancient, was shot in the vital part of her body and died. Ruizhi's son, Qiyun, was taken out by the bandits for more than a mile before he was released after begging. This is also a great fortune in misfortune. It is estimated that the stolen clothing and accessories were worth about four or five hundred gold. When the anti-smuggling team stationed in Kongjia Que heard the alarm and went to chase, the bandits had already gone far away.</p>

<p>Public Prosecution Filed in the Tragic Death Case of Hu Zhang. At the beginning of the establishment of the County Court, the case of the Hu surname in Da Wuqiao plotting to kill his wife caused a sensation in the whole city. The Procuratorate immediately arrested Hu Yinglong and his aunt Hu Nie for investigation and supervised the officials to open the coffin for examination. After several investigations by the Procuratorate, the public prosecution was filed. It is heard that the indictment states that Hu Yinglong had premeditated the crime. In the quiet of the night, in the inner chamber, there was no one else. Therefore, Hu Yinglong could not shirk the responsibility of suspicion. Moreover, according to the confession, he had slightly twisted her with minor suspicion before the incident, and finger and claw marks were found on the neck of the body. The Criminal Court of the Court held a hearing on the 9th to investigate everything. It is heard that Hu Yinglong and others have hired lawyer Zhang Baopei to defend them. The Court has scheduled another date for public debate.</p>
<p>The Security Regiment Conducts a General Cleaning. Cao Pang, the commander of the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team, led his team to station in Songjiang. In addition to training in January, he also noted that there were many pits and accumulated garbage in Songcheng. He advocated on the 3rd, when various groups gathered for a New Year's dinner, that the troops should clean up the segments in sections. The proposal was supported by the public. The First District Office provided a large number of brooms and baskets and ordered the departure this morning (11th), personally leading the cleaning. Although the cold wind was strong and the ground was covered with ice and snow, they were spirited and courageous. At that time, the whole city was illuminated. It is heard that the police will also hold regular meetings to promote this initiative.</p>
<p>Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition. The Art Department of the First Public Education Center in Puzhao Temple in the city has now obtained the consent of various collectors in Songjiang and writers from the Songfeng Calligraphy and Painting Society to open an exhibition of ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings in the department from the 13th of this month for one week. It is heard that the ancient painting section will be exchanged every two days, all of which are rare and valuable masterpieces. At that time, there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Preparatory Committee for the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Wuxian: The Preparatory Committee for the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Wuxian held its fourth general meeting on the afternoon of the 10th. The fundraising committee, divided into 25 groups, reported the names of the elected heads and deputy heads of each group. It was then decided that the collected donations would be managed by the Guohua and Xinfu banks. The method for soliciting designs was also approved before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Proposal to Establish a Wireless Radio Station: The Su-Ge long-distance telephone system was originally established to facilitate bandit suppression. However, in the event of major bandit attacks, the telephone lines were often damaged by bandits. Recently, specialist Chen Zongtai submitted a proposal to the Construction Bureau, requesting the establishment of a wireless radio station in Suzhou, with four branch stations set up at key locations such as Jiaozhi and Dongshan. The estimated initial cost is over 29,000 yuan, with a monthly operating cost of 600 yuan for the main station and 300 yuan for each branch station. A detailed plan was submitted to Director Wei of the Bureau, who praised the plan. Yesterday (the 11th), he approved it, awaiting consideration and implementation.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Journalists' United Association: The Suzhou Journalists' Association is preparing to reorganize the Wuxian Journalists' United Association.

<p>Request to Abolish the Special Silk Cocoon Tax: The Silk Factory Guild of this county stated that after the silk cocoon tax was ordered to be abolished, the Ministry of Finance intended to introduce a special silk cocoon tax. Factory silk is a major part of foreign trade. China is based on agriculture, and silk cocoons are originally a by-product of farmers. Since factory silk has been sold to Europe and the United States, silk cocoons have become a major item for increasing national economic strength. In recent years, the European and American silk markets have been controlled by Japanese merchants, and the business of Chinese merchants has plummeted. The only way to reverse the failure of the silk industry is to eliminate all taxes and reduce the cost of factory silk. This will allow Chinese silk to compete with Japanese silk and have a chance of winning. If a special silk cocoon tax is reintroduced, it will directly increase the burden on silk merchants, indirectly reduce foreign trade, and shrink the national economic strength. Therefore, the guild sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting it to forward the letter to the Ministry of Finance and quickly abolish the proposal to levy a special silk cocoon tax, in order to maintain international trade and give silk merchants a glimmer of hope. After receiving the letter, the County Chamber of Commerce stated that factory silk is a major part of foreign trade in China, which seems to be different from other silk. In recent years, the cost of factory silk in foreign trade has been too high to compete with Japanese silk, which is indeed the main reason. If taxes can be eliminated to reduce costs, it may be a way to encourage improvement. Therefore, the chamber immediately forwarded a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to consider and approve the matter.</p>
<p>County Government Burns a Large Quantity of Opium and Gambling Paraphernalia: Pan Geng-sheng, the county magistrate of this county, recently discovered that a large number of opium and gambling paraphernalia had been seized and stored on record. From the time of his predecessor to his own tenure, up to December 24th, a total of 1,087 cases of opium pills and gambling paraphernalia had been seized. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 pm, all the opium pills and gambling paraphernalia stored on record were piled up in front of the county government's auditorium and burned in public. At the same time, the magistrates of Wuxian and Kunshan counties dispatched section members to Wuxi to supervise the proceedings, as instructed by the Civil Affairs Department and the High Court, to show solemnity. An Appeal to Reduce Interest on Pawned Items: The Pawnbrokers' Union of this county stated that Article 16 of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Regulations on the Pawnbroking Industry stipulates that if a pawned item is redeemed more than five days after the expiration date, the interest should be reduced by half a month; if it is redeemed more than fifteen days, the interest should be reduced by one month. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the pawnbrokers' unions of various counties, urging them to jointly appeal to the government to postpone the implementation of Article 16 of the Provincial Regulations on the Pawnbroking Industry.</p>

<p>Opening the Lingyun Canal and Training Supervisors: The Wujin Section Committee for Dredging the Canal completed the preparatory procedures for construction. After holding a groundbreaking ceremony on the 5th, it gathered about 60 supervisors from various sections on the 8th and 9th at the county middle school auditorium to train them. Zhuang Zhong-xi, Director of the Construction Bureau, and engineer Xia Yin-zhi, lectured on various aspects of the canal dredging. Once the canal workers arrive in Changzhou, each supervisor must go to their posts to serve.</p>
<p>County Court Holds a Meeting: After the establishment of the Wuyi County Court, the existing court building was insufficient. The High Court was requested to transfer the old county government office to be used as the court. After the provincial government ordered Wu County magistrate to investigate and report, the former Wuxian magistrate convened a meeting.

<p>The Business Situation in Tongyi Last Year: The Nantong business is centered on cotton yarn and cloth. Nantong suffered a poor cotton harvest in 1930. The yarn market was extremely sluggish, and the total transaction volume of native cloth was 10 million yuan, only 60% of that in 1929. As a result, various industries were not prosperous. In the Tangzha industry, the Dasheng Yarn Factory accounted for the most profits, with more than 700,000 yuan. The Dasheng Sub-Factory in Jiangjiaqiao earned 320,000 yuan. Almost all yarn industries in the city were at a loss. The financial sector was not at a great disadvantage due to prudent lending. The foreign goods industry suffered heavy losses, and Xinchangzhuang and others have gone bankrupt.</p>

<p>Opening Up of Sanmen Bay Has Begun: The opening up of Sanmen Bay in Zhejiang Province is related to the livelihood of the people and the wealth and strength of the country. Previously, merchant Xu Ting-zu requested to pledge his assets to the government to borrow 500,000 yuan in public bonds to contract for the opening up of the bay. The central government and the Zhejiang Provincial Investigation Department have jointly surveyed and designed the matter. However, the Ministry of Finance felt that the financial aspect was impossible to think about because military affairs had just been settled and there were many things to be handled. Xu also understood this situation, so he has raised funds from overseas Chinese and started the first phase of the project. In addition to the seawall and dam projects that have already started construction, he is also planning the reclamation area to relocate farmers for spring ploughing.</p>
<p>The Various Bureaus of the Construction Department are Streamlined into Sections: Shi Ying, Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, has implemented a tightening policy for the affiliated institutions of the department.

<p>Association for Continuing Supplementary Geng Funds for Students Studying in Japan</p>
<p>In order to resist Japan's cultural aggression against China, the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had been working to abolish the Agreement on Japanese Cultural Undertakings in China, which was signed between the former Beijing government and Japan. In July of last year, the Ministry of Education ordered the Supervisory Office for Students Studying in Japan to stop recruiting students with supplementary Geng funds to show its determination to abolish the agreement. Recently, Gao Qian and other self-funded students studying in Japan organized the Association for Continuing Supplementary Geng Funds for Students Studying in Japan, requesting the Ministry of Education to restore the supplementary Geng fund quotas and distributed leaflets that were widely published in newspapers. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has specifically ordered the Supervisory Office for Students Studying in Japan to inform the students that the government is seeking to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement and that the supplementary Geng funds have not been restored. The original order is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>It has recently been found that Gao Qian and other students studying in Japan have submitted a report to the Ministry of Education in the name of the Association for Continuing Supplementary Geng Funds for Students Studying in Japan, requesting permission to restore the supplementary Geng fund quotas for students studying in Japan. At the same time, they have also printed and distributed the "Letter to All Circles of the Association for Continuing Supplementary Geng Funds for Students Studying in Japan" and published it widely in newspapers. They have completely disregarded the Ministry of Education's intention to stop the supplementary Geng fund quotas in order to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement. It should be known that before this negotiation is resolved, it is extremely difficult to restore the supplementary Geng fund quotas. Moreover, when these students went abroad, they were required to raise sufficient funds for their entire study abroad expenses in accordance with the regulations. How can they rely solely on this? In view of the above, you are hereby ordered to immediately comply with the order and report the dissolution of the association for filing.</p>

<p>The Formal Style of Communication between Education Bureaus and Education Associations</p>
<p>Should Use "Order"</p>
<p>The Education Bureau of Huaining County, Anhui Province, requested clarification on the formal style of communication between the county education bureau and the county education association, as it was incomplete. The regulations of the Education Association and the Ministry of Education's Order No. 1087 of the 18th year of the Republic of China specified that the Education Association should use "report" when communicating with the Education Bureau, but there were no clear regulations on the Education Bureau's communication with the Education Association. Therefore, the Anhui Education Department was requested to interpret the matter. The Anhui Education Department, because the matter involved the interpretation of laws and regulations, forwarded it to the Ministry of Education for instructions. It is reported that the Ministry has interpreted the instructions as follows: "All provincial, municipal, and county educational administrative organs should use 'order' when communicating with subordinate education associations."</p>

<p>Explains the Competent Authority for Student Self-Government Associations</p>
<p>The Education Department of Jiangsu Province requested the Ministry of Education to interpret whether student self-government associations should be under the respective jurisdiction of county and municipal governments, in accordance with the Implementation Rules of the Organizational Outline of Student Self-Government Associations promulgated by the central government. It is reported that the original text of the Ministry of Education's interpretation is as follows: "Article 6 of the Implementation Rules of the Organizational Outline of Student Self-Government Associations states: 'When the student self-government association has completed its organization, it must submit its constitution, resume of officers, and list of members to the local senior party department for approval, and then report to the school and the competent authority for record.' According to this article, the student self-government associations of schools at all levels in the provinces and cities should be under the respective jurisdiction of the municipal and county governments, and their constitutions do not need to be submitted to the Provincial Education Department for approval."</p>

<p>Since the new director of the Zhejiang Education Department took office, the reorganization has been completed. There have been few changes to the original staff, and they have all remained in their original positions to maintain familiarity.

In addition, the original offices of the department were very narrow and insufficient, especially the supervisor's office, which was small, crowded, and had many dark storage rooms, which hindered official duties. Director Zhang specially reduced the size of the auditorium slightly and expanded the left and right sides to make it usable. The dismantling and manufacturing are currently underway.</p>
<p>Zhang Nanxian, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, recently went to the Education Department to inspect and discuss the progress of education in the province with Director Zhang. He also summoned all the secretaries, section chiefs, and supervisors to give instructions, saying that the work of the agency depends on the collective wisdom and strength, and hoped that they would work together to eliminate all obstacles and make the education of Zhejiang Province develop day by day. The educational funds should be raised by the Finance Department so that there would be no delays in the future, so that they could be expanded.</p>

<p>The Xu team's offense progressed smoothly, frequently posing threats before the opponent's goal. Their five forwards constantly pressured, while Xu's midfielder, He Lei, commanded the field with ease. Their momentum was unstoppable, seemingly destined for victory. However, a defensive lapse allowed Ge Tisi to penetrate from the left, delivering a cross. Sinclair responded instantly, scoring a goal. Despite Zhou Xianyan's valiant effort to save it, he was unable to prevent it. After conceding a goal, the Xu team rallied. Within two minutes, Ke Lasha embarked on a solo effort, directly challenging Long Bote Lan, who was helpless to stop him, resulting in a 1-1 tie. The Xu team launched another fierce attack. Fa Fan Qie Er broke through the defense with incredible speed. Bote Lan instinctively raised both hands, believing the ball had gone out of bounds. However, it miraculously entered the net. Thus, the Xu team finished the first half with a 2-1 lead over the Gu Shi Tai team, turning the match into a draw.</p>
<p>After switching sides, the game's momentum shifted slightly. The Gu Shi Tai team launched several counterattacks, displaying considerable activity. Sure enough, after ten minutes into the second half, Wo Ke Mei unleashed a powerful shot with his accurate instep towards the goal. Zhou Xianyan bravely dove to block it, but unfortunately, it went in, resulting in a 2-2 tie, adding another layer of tension. Ke Lasha, proving his brilliance, once again scored, giving the Xu team a 3-2 lead. Victory seemed within Xu's grasp, but two minutes before the end of the game, Wo Ke Mei scored his third goal, resulting in a 3-3 draw and ending the match.</p>

<p>During the New Year holiday, various sectors were closed, so there were many people exercising at the City Public Sports Field. The crowd was bustling, and cheers resounded everywhere. In addition to the martial arts department holding a performance on New Year's Day, various football teams preparing to join the Industry and Commerce Football Competition would practice and compete several times a day. However, since the 5th, continuous rain and snow made the scene bleak. The results of the ball game matches on various days are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Free Talk New Rhapsody for New Year's Day - Heaven, Void, Me, Life</p>
<p>People get up late on the solar New Year, the people's spirit is high, and the calendar is low. What can be seen in the six streets and five markets? National flags are hung at the doors of every household. The rice paper is dyed bright red, printed with couplets for the New Year. The sound of gongs and drums is like thunder, and the fast cars rush through the streets. The guest houses in West Lake are full, like a long holiday during Qingming. The tea houses and restaurants are crowded with people, and those who come are often unexpected. Gamblers have always feared the police, but today they are acting as gamblers. Sharing happiness with the people should be the case, and serving the country is also in this regard. Don't you see the storytellers sitting high in the hall, their oily hair sweating and their voices hoarse? They painstakingly want to win the laughter of thousands of people, but what harm is there in relaxing the ban for a day? The old people in the countryside tell each other that the world is truly strange today. They pick up burdens and go into the city in the morning, but no one cares about the big and small scales. They don't see delicate maids calling along the street, only mischievous children playing. The market keepers are with hot dogs, and the beggars in the flower market are dressed as fake lions. They can't get enough to eat without money in the middle of the day, and the green vegetables are about to rot. Life is short, enjoy it in time, quickly call your wife and children, don't raise two sows, don't feed five hens. People have already celebrated the New Year, why are you and I still suffering from hunger? Failure to collect rent is a mistake, and letting go of the New Year is rare. I think the sages have ancient teachings, and what the people like, we should like too. Just look at the faces of the spring breeze guests, already smugly happy. It turns out that governing the country and pacifying the world can be done by letting them do it without letting them know.</p>
<p>Record of the Strange Stones of Jiaoshan Mountain</p>
<p>Jiaoshan Mountain stands tall in Jingkou, and its beautiful scenery has always been famous. The Zhou Dynasty Ding, the Han Dynasty Drum, and Yang Wenxiang's jade belt have been repeatedly seen and spoken of by predecessors. However, the strange and beautiful stones have been hidden among the ordinary, and have not been praised by tourists. This is often the case in the world. I am writing this to introduce them to future tourists.</p>
<p>There are eight stones, four in each place. Three are secretly placed in Jiaoshan, and the rest are placed in the Wenchang Pavilion. The ones secretly placed in Jiaoshan are said by the monks to have been brought from Han Dynasty by a certain official of the Qing Dynasty. The stones are similar in size, about two inches long and wide. One is like a portrait of a beauty in ancient costume, with delicate and charming facial features and slightly blurred features. The hair seems to be covered in a light gauze. One is like a boat with masts, sails, and hull complete, slowly moving in the middle of the stream, fitting the poetic meaning of "a wild ferry with no one, the boat crossing by itself." One is like a plum blossom, with soft branches, slender branches, and abundant flowers, very similar to the potted plants in Suzhou, showing a charming attitude towards people. One is like an image of the God of Longevity, with a towering forehead, long beard, and wide robes, leaning on a cane. The ones in the Wenchang Pavilion are larger than the previous ones, and the texture is also delicate. The images are particularly lifelike. One pattern is like a clump of bamboo, with the Bodhisattva Guanyin reclining under the green bamboo shade. The beauty of the image and the naturalness of the posture are extremely admirable. The rest are a plum blossom, a Zhong Kui, and a landscape. The plum blossom has ancient branches, gnarled branches, and buds about to bloom. Zhong Kui has a red face, bristling beard, bent arms, and wide eyes, extremely vivid. The landscape has a natural layout, sparse and distant, like the brushstrokes of Qing Xiang's Bada. The monks said that Chiang Kai-shek had also visited and observed the stones, pointing to a black spot on the top of the stone and saying to his entourage, "If this point were changed from black to ochre or white, then this stone would be priceless." It is said that ochre resembles the sun and white resembles the moon. The monks also said that these four stones are half artificial, unlike the ones secretly placed in Jiaoshan, which are completely natural. When Sun Chuanfang resisted the Northern Expeditionary Army in Jingkou, he used artillery to bombard Elephant Mountain, collapsing a corner of the mountain. The monks then brought back the collapsed stones with strange patterns and processed them to obtain these shapes. (Que Chou)</p>
<p>New Year's Anecdotes from the Pear Garden - Praise</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang, Tan Fuying, Wang Fengqing, and others at the Grand Theater extended their full-term contract over the New Year's Eve. With the theater owner's persuasion, they were allowed to continue for seven days, including five days of helping out, for a total of twelve days. After Mei and Tan leave, the Shanghai stars will maintain the theater for two weeks until the 21st, when Yang Xiaolou, Ma Lianliang, and Xue Yanqin will take over. The conditions for Yang and Ma have been agreed upon, and the contract has been signed. It is said that the date was initially set for fifteen days, and the method of continuation will be discussed based on future performance. The ticket price has been internally set, and the highest price will not exceed three yuan. Recorded by Zhu Shenghu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shenghu from Fengxian</p>
<p>Zhu Shenghu, whose style name is Jichen, recently changed it to Jicheng, for reasons unknown. He is the second son of the poet Li Lianyou, who is known for his elegant and refined style. Zhu Shenghu is quiet and withdrawn, rarely smiling, and seems out of place in the world. He keeps his room clean, burns incense, and sits quietly, like an ancient recluse. However, when he meets kindred spirits, he becomes warm and courteous, with proper manners. When he is happy, he laughs loudly, startling everyone around him. He is skilled in painting and calligraphy, and is especially proficient in seal carving. His running script follows the style of Yan Zhenqing and Huang Tingjian, with a strong and upright style. His brushstrokes are like a swordsman carrying a sword, or a strange pine tree with beautiful rocks, displaying a proud and resolute spirit. His clerical script originates from Zhang Qian and Heng Fang, incorporating the brushstrokes of the Wan Sou, which are profound, simple, and full of changes. Like an old vine in an ancient garden, its roots are intertwined. The traces of the Xiang crossing the river are like meditation. His painting style is similar to Yun Jiang's, elegant and free from vulgarity. He doesn't make many ugly paintings, and few people understand him. His seal carving follows the style of Wan Bai and Bei An, with moist white characters and strong red characters. His successful works directly pursue the Qin style. He loves solitude and silence, and his walls are covered with famous calligraphy and paintings. He focuses his mind and meditates, learning from the ancients. He is different from modern writers who chase fame and fortune, and bow down to the wealthy. Therefore, his name is not well-known, and few people understand him. The old plaque of his residence, Rong Yu Tang, is said by those who know it to be better than Su Kan's, and not just empty praise. Great mountains breed pearls, and hidden jades contain glory. How can a gem remain hidden forever? Will those who know Mr. Zhu not forget him?</p>
<p>Aerial Torpedo Boat Fu Cun</p>
<p>The American Cole Dubonnet planned to create an aerial torpedo boat after the European War, and it is now ready and undergoing testing. This boat can travel on land, sea, and air. The boat's design is similar to ordinary airplanes, except that instead of wings, it has a huge dish-shaped rotating wheel installed on top of the entire boat, like an umbrella. Its engine is a Carsley engine, installed in the center of the entire boat. The entire boat is made up of three boats combined into one. The middle boat is the largest, and the engine is installed in it. The two boats on the left and right are smaller and are used for passengers. The rear of the boat also has a tail, which is about the same length as an airplane. The end of the tail is equipped with a rudder, which is also a smaller rotating wheel, but one is installed vertically and the other horizontally. When flying in the air and descending, the dish-shaped rotating wheel stops rotating, and its function is like a parachute, very stable and comfortable. The bottom of the boat is boat-shaped, so it can float on water. When it wants to land on land, the two small boats on the left and right that carry passengers have movable wheels, one on each side, which can be retracted and lowered at will. According to the inventor, Dubonnet, the gasoline required for this boat to ascend is less than that of other airplanes, it is more stable to ride, and the cost is also very low. Currently, two prototype boats have been manufactured, and the test results are very satisfactory. The edge of the dish-shaped wheel of one of the boats is made of a trumpet-shaped air duct, which uses air to push out from the inside, thereby rotating the entire wheel.</p>
<p>A Review of the Year in Film Miao Xiu</p>
<p>The year 1930 has passed quickly. Here, I want to make a simple review of the domestic films of the year. I think this is a good lesson, or it can make people inside and outside the film industry work together to promote domestic films.</p>
<p>Although there are quite a few domestic film companies in Shanghai in name, compared to the number of productions, only the Mingxing Film Company has produced more. It is rare to see other companies produce more than ten films. However, at least 300 foreign films have been brought to Shanghai for their initial release. Domestic films have only produced a maximum of 100 films. On the one hand, it can be seen that the leakage of films is not small. On the other hand, it can be seen that domestic films are still in their urgent struggle period.</p>
<p>However, if we look at the box office records of several famous films, we feel that domestic films also have the opportunity to revive. According to a survey, since the arrival of sound films in Shanghai, foreign theaters in Shanghai have rarely been able to make money. On the one hand, it has been affected by the price of gold. On the other hand, it is due to the language barrier. It is better to watch domestic films such as Hong Lian Si and other films that have always maintained the faith of the masses.</p>
<p>Parisian Tales (1) Six Once Upon a Time in Paris</p>
<p>An Old Film in a Small Cinema</p>
<p>Now, sound films can be considered to be at their peak in Paris. The large cinemas near the Opéra, the most lively place in Paris, play only sound films every day. These sound films mostly have many musical and dance interludes. Of course, there are good ones, but I think most of them are very mediocre and too trendy. Sometimes, because the director doesn't know how to handle it well, there is loud shouting in places where silence is needed, which is really disappointing.</p>
<p>I don't completely dislike sound films, but sometimes I think silent films are more interesting. In silence, we can carefully appreciate the actors' facial expressions and all their actions. If our palace needs musical stimulation, I think a real band is better than the dumb sound passed through a microphone. For example, when the screen shows a romantic encounter under the moon and flowers, if a real violinist slowly plays a soft tune, wouldn't that be more interesting and poetic than the noise of these sound films?</p>
<p>But if you still want to savor outdated silent films in Paris now, you must not go to the large cinemas on those grand Boulevards to ask. You can try your luck in the small cinemas in the Latin Quarter for four or five francs, or you might still be able to find them.</p>
<p>There are many small cinemas in the Latin Quarter, mostly for students to pass the time. Naturally, there are also small businessmen and workers inside. The tickets for these small cinemas are very cheap. You can get a decent seat for about five francs. From Monday to Friday, there are not many people. Only on Saturdays and Sundays is it really crowded. If you don't buy a ticket in advance, you sometimes have to queue at the door for an hour to get in.</p>
<p>These small cinemas also play sound films a lot, but they still retain a part of the effort of silent films. If you are lucky, you can sometimes see very good films. If you want to get unexpected satisfaction at a very small price, then the small cinemas in the Latin Quarter can really be said to be a very suitable place to pass the time.</p>
<p>Now, I will talk about an unremarkable silent film that I recently saw in a small cinema in the Latin Quarter that made me satisfied. Welcome, it can be seen that domestic films have a new way out in this era of sound films.</p>
<p>The most memorable thing in this year is the creation of Chinese sound films. "Wild Grasses and Leisurely Flowers" is only a partly dubbed sound film, but it can be regarded as a prelude. And what we should pay the most attention to is that the fully sound film "Songstress Red Peony" released by Mingxing Company can also be performed in the near future. It is expected that domestic films after this can be more full of new interest and vitality.</p>
<p>In short, in the past year, it has been very difficult for Chinese films to maintain their inherent position in society. Fortunately, Heaven has given a good opportunity. In the near future, it will definitely be able to reawaken the enthusiastic belief of our people in domestic films because of the release of the domestic sound film "Songstress Red Peony". Then, I hereby wish "the 20th year of the Republic of China will be the era of the development of domestic films."</p>
<p>Recorded by Xiao Yuan, narrated by Chen Xianrong</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend sent a letter from Luo Yue, mentioning that there was an old man there who could understand the language of apes. Therefore, I have recorded this for readers' entertainment.</p>
<p>Luo Yue is a remote and isolated region, thousands of miles away from the Central Plains. In the past, it was a place where the virtues of the sage kings could not reach, and a den of poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Fish, monkeys, apes, and the like often appeared together, which troubled the scholars. In Xiao Sha (a small village in Luo Yue), there was an old man who was old in age but energetic. He disliked socializing and was dull and incompetent. However, he could understand the language of apes and communicate with them. Jiao Jiao Ai Ai was his specialty. One day, a group of apes came out to trample on the crops, which was unbearable. The scholars asked the old man for help. The old man immediately went to the group of apes, blew his reed tongue, and strongly advised them not to worry about the crops. The apes obeyed and retreated. Therefore, the crops of the scholars were safe, so everyone praised his merits.</p>
<p>The author notes that what my friend said may not be fictional. In ancient times, the officials of the Yi Li tribe were in charge of communicating with birds, and the officials of the He Li tribe were in charge of communicating with beasts. Jie Ge Lu could understand the mooing of cows, and Gongye Chang could recognize the language of birds. There have been such things for a long time. Only the section where the old man persuaded the apes not to disturb the crops seems absurd and unfounded. I hope that there are often mysterious and incomprehensible things in the world. I will just record it.</p>
<p>Warmth in My Heart (347) Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Earnestly Asking for Words, Emerald Sleeves Visit the Teacher; Generously Discussing Military Affairs, a Heroine's Banquet in the Brothel</p>
<p>Now, the hairstyle of that Ms. Ren Peizhen is not some Chaoqian style or Xiangda style, nor is it the current Fengliang style or Huanxin style. That hairstyle is somewhat like the one worn by Japanese women, with a circle of hair covering the surroundings. The Japanese call it "Kasa." When Ren Peizhen walked into the room, the eyes of everyone in the room, unintentionally and naturally, focused on her alone. Not only did the people in Luyi's room seem to see someone with strange clothes and a strange language, but even the singers who were called in were a little surprised to see the chest-thumping, belly-protruding female hero come in, and they whispered to each other. When Zuo Shichen saw her come in, today he was the host and should fulfill his duties as the host, so he stood up and greeted her and asked her to take a seat. Although the people present knew that she was the famous female revolutionary Ren Peizhen, they had never met her before. This was because Mr. Sun Qilei first introduced the host of today, Zuo Shichen, and then introduced all the people present. Moreover, that Ren Peizhen had a strange temper. Although she was a woman, she did not like people calling her "Ms." She said that since men and women were equal, why should women be specially labeled with the word "woman"? A scholar is a scholar, why distinguish between men and women? If a woman is called "Ms.," it is obvious that there is some discrimination against women. She called the people who were with her in the revolution at that time "comrades." Therefore, many people called her "Comrade Ren Peizhen." As for casual acquaintances, they would call her "Mr. Ren Peizhen." She said that the two words "Mr." are the best, and there is no distinction between men and women in terms of their meaning. Sun Qilei had already notified the people present in advance to call her "Mr. Ren," and even the people in the room had already been told to call her "Mr. Ren." Otherwise, based on her age and appearance, she should of course be called "Madam." In fact, she had never formally married, and according to the rules, she could only be called "Miss." But Ren Peizhen was not like a "Miss" at all, and the title of "Miss" inevitably had some corruption. It was common to call her "Mr.," especially in the Tangzi, they would never call a woman "Mr." as a special thing, because their leather makers also called women "Mr.," and distinguished between "Big Mr.," "Small Mr.," and "Sharp Mr.," and so on, so it could be considered popular. At that time, everyone called her "Mr. Ren," asked her to take a seat, and gave her the highest seat. She humbly declined and said that this seat was not good to sit on, everyone else had come later. Besides, Mr. Ren was a female hero of our Republic of China, a great revolutionary. We have admired her for a long time, and it is a great honor to be able to look up to her here today. That Ms. Ren did not decline too much. She was always generous, so she politely took the head seat.</p>

<p>Wang Zhengting Returned to Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>Going North to Tianjin Today and Planning to Go to Peking</p>
<p>Participating in the Ceremony to Receive the Belgian Concession in Tientsin</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting took the night train to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night. According to an interview with a reporter from this newspaper at the train station, he plans to accompany Xu Mo and Diao Minqian to Tianjin tomorrow (i.e., today) to participate in the ceremony to receive the Belgian Concession in Tianjin. He also plans to visit Peking on the way. He expects to return to Beijing in about a week. The Sino-Japanese Ning case has been basically negotiated, and a formal signing can be done after one or two more meetings. The replies to the Six-Nation Legal Rights Conference have been delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, except for Brazil, which has not arrived due to the long distance. The meeting is now scheduled to continue in February.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Pays Attention to Public Security in the Concessions</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Bureau and the Chairman of the Board of Directors</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, requesting strict investigation of theft cases, stating, "We are writing to you because Huaitong Company stated in a letter that they had read the newspaper and learned that your association had sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau complaining about their lack of effort in preventing bandits. We are very grateful for this. Unfortunately, our company was also robbed at 7 a.m. on the 22nd of this month. A week has passed, and we have been inquiring with the police station every day, but there has been no news. This shows the ineffectiveness of the bureau's work. Our company is not a large merchant, but a small business. The loss from this accident will make everyone feel insecure in the future if there is no day when the truth comes out. All taxpayers in the concession should have their safety protected. The amount of the robbery suffered by our company is about 6,000 yuan, which is not a small amount. We will now present the situation of the robbers at that time. On the 21st of the month, which was a Sunday, six robbers suddenly came at 7 p.m. They spoke in various dialects. Five of them held guns and went upstairs, while one held a gun downstairs to monitor the tea servants and others. They arbitrarily ransacked the boxes and baskets, robbing everything. They robbed 2,300 yuan in Bank of China banknotes, 500 yuan in silver dollars, and milk beads, pearl rings, gold and silver jewelry, etc., worth about 3,000 or 4,000 yuan at the negotiated old price, for a total of more than 6,000 yuan. We reported to the old police station and asked them to investigate. They sent detectives to inspect and inquire at our company, but a week has passed, and there have been no results. Our colleagues are strangers in a foreign land, and they have no way to seek help. We earnestly ask for your assistance and ask the police station to solve the case as soon as possible to reassure the people."</p>
<p>The letter also stated that the association had sent a letter inquiring whether the bureau had the ability to maintain public order due to the frequent kidnapping cases, and that the director of the bureau had made a statement to the Greater American Evening News on December 27, saying that it was because the victims did not report to the police station. The association now stated that the director's statement was completely fabricated, otherwise why would the case have been reported to the police but no progress had been made in the investigation so far. It is appropriate to send a letter to your bureau to check and order the case to be strictly investigated and solved quickly to reassure the people.</p>
<p>Correcting Fei Xindun's Remarks The association also sent a letter to the chairman of the Public Works Bureau, stating, "We are writing to you because kidnapping cases are frequent and even result in deaths and injuries. On December 26 of last year, we sent a letter to your bureau asking whether you have the ability to maintain public order, etc., but we have not received a reply. Unexpectedly, we saw that the director of your bureau, Fei Xindun, made a statement to the Greater American Evening News on December 27, and his remarks were very irresponsible. His statement that one policeman cannot be assigned to each household is even more nonsensical. The director holds an important position and should think of ways to ensure the safety of all taxpayers in the city and fulfill his responsibilities. Taxpayers are unwilling to hire someone who only makes irresponsible remarks and serves as a decoration to the municipal government with a huge annual salary. It is appropriate to send a letter to you, hoping that you will check and correct him quickly."</p>

<p>Upon further questioning regarding the birthdates of the alleged three children, his answers were evasive and contradictory, clearly indicating suspected abduction and trafficking of persons. He was instructed to prepare a document and submit it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Edward's Case Against the Public Works Department to be Tried Within a Month <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Public Works Department General Manager Edward has filed a complaint with the Consular Court against his unwarranted dismissal by the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department's response was submitted to the court by its representative lawyer yesterday afternoon (the 10th), but its contents will not be disclosed for the time being. It is rumored that this case involves significant issues, so the Consular Court has deviated from its usual practice by adding two additional consuls to jointly preside over the trial. It is expected to commence within a month at the latest.

<h3 id="e92">Regulations for Indoor Wiring for Electrical Users in This City <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<h3 id="e93">Notice from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau issued a notice on January 9th, stating: "For the purpose of announcing that, following an order from the Municipal Government, the Construction Committee was consulted and found that the electrical industry in our country has been developing rapidly in recent years. The installation of indoor electrical wiring and all safety equipment should be subject to regulations to ensure compliance. After reviewing the domestic electrical industry, and consulting the practices of various countries, this bureau has formulated forty-five regulations for the installation of indoor electrical wiring, along with seven appendices. It has been stipulated that the regulations will take effect on January 1, 1931, and have been promulgated by bureau order and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval on record. In addition to issuing separate orders to the construction departments of various provinces and consulting them separately, corresponding regulations are hereby enclosed for your government's review and requested promulgation, and for directing all subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<p>It further attached regulations to the government. The bureau issued a separate order instructing electrical companies to comply and give public notice.</p>
<p>An investigation reveals that these regulations pertain to the current methods of installing indoor electrical wiring. These regulations are similar in nature to the "Regulations for Indoor Wiring for Electrical Users in This City" previously promulgated. However, the former only covers the installation of electrical lighting wires, while the latter includes both electrical lighting wires and power lines. Now that the Construction Committee, as the central government's competent authority, has promulgated the above-mentioned regulations, the regulations of the same nature promulgated by this city in the name of the local government should be abolished. However, regarding the methods for installing indoor power lines, the provisions of the "Regulations for Indoor Wiring for Electrical Users in This City" pertaining to power lines will continue to apply until the central government promulgates rules. This matter has already been submitted to the Municipal Government for record. This notice is hereby given for public knowledge.</p>

<p>The Zhongshe, after half a year of preparation, officially opened on New Year's Day. At 9:00 AM on that day, members and guests gathered in the assembly hall on the lower floor. At 10:00 AM, a bell rang to commence the opening ceremony. First, the brass band played music, and everyone stood up to sing the party anthem. Chairman Wu Jingxiong read the President's last will and testament and performed the ceremonial rites. The chairman first congratulated the nation on its unification and wished the members health. He then explained the Zhongshe's objectives, which are to promote the balanced development of moral, physical, intellectual, and aesthetic education. The undertakings promoted by the Zhongshe are based on these four aspects. Although the current facilities are rudimentary, future development will require the efforts of all members. He then expressed gratitude to Mr. Zhang Ganru, who provided funding for the construction of the premises and waived the rent, and to Mr. Li Gufan, who worked tirelessly for the Zhongshe, on behalf of the members.</p>
<p>Speeches were then given by Zi Min, Min, Yang Zi, and Wu Mai. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. At noon, the first members' meeting and luncheon were held, chaired by Mr. Chen Fangzhi, who reported on the preparations and proposed the addition of Zhang Weici and Xu Yongzuo as directors, Zhang Jiongbo and Wang Xin as members of the Economic Committee, and Qu Jigang and Guo Waihui as members of the Club Committee.

<h3 id="e96">Undertaken by the Daye Printing House on Yalu Road <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Red Flag Daily, a reactionary publication, had long been banned by the authorities, but its printer remained unknown, allowing it to continue publishing on schedule. It has now been discovered by the Zhabei Police Department that the newspaper was printed by the Daye Printing House, located at 67 Yalu Road, Hongkou, founded by Qian Jinkan from Shaoxing. At 8:30 AM on the 9th, Chinese and Western detectives, some disguised as drivers, drove to the printing house to search it. Upon arriving at the entrance, they saw Qian's brother, Jin Gao, taking a bundle of over four thousand copies of the Red Flag Daily from inside, intending to transport them elsewhere. The detectives immediately intercepted him. Qian Jinkan's wife, Qian Chen, and hired laborers, Li Zhaochang, Liu Agen, Yang Enpei, and others, dared to rush out of the printing house to support Jin Gao and resist arrest, assaulting Detective Zhang Yousheng and Detective No. 96. Detective No. 96, seeing that these individuals were acting lawlessly, fired five shots into the air to subdue them. The detectives then entered the printing house and found a replica pistol, three seals, four thousand copies of the Red Flag Daily, and a set of type. Qian Jinkan and his associates, Cao Genfa, Hua Renliang, and Shi Risheng, who were hiding inside, were arrested. The following morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court. Because the police department charged them under Articles 6 and 10 of the Anti-Revolutionary Act and Article 142 of the Criminal Code, the local court could not accept the case and transferred it to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. Criminal Division Chief Song Zhisheng held a hearing and ordered the case to be adjourned for further verification. The defendants were then taken back to the detention center by the police.</p>

<p>Xu Zhijiang, from Zhejiang, claiming to be commissioned by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force as the temporary commander of the Third Division of the First Forward March Team of the Anti-Rebellion Army, resided at Room 205, Qinghe Hotel, Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. Because the military situation was unsettled, Chen Yefa, who resided at 823 Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, joined Xu's force. Chen was assigned by Xu as a special agent, but for several months, he was never dispatched for service or received any salary. Chen suspected that Xu was impersonating a military officer to defraud him of money and reported him to the Public Safety Bureau. The bureau chief dispatched detectives to cooperate with the Zhabei Police Department and secretly arrested Xu Zhijiang. Yang Wenjie, the chief of staff of the division, and Huang Hongbin, the boxing instructor of the First Regiment of the Central Military Police, who were in the same room as Xu, were also detained and sent to the Special District Local Court. The presiding judge interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Achievements of Tongren Fu Yuan Hall and its Branch <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Hunan News reports that Tongren Fu Yuan Hall, Shanghai's only charitable organization, is well-managed and has significantly benefited the local community. In order to promote public understanding and awareness, the hall has released a report on the total number of coffins provided each month. According to the statistics for December of last year: 1) Tongren Fu Yuan Hall provided 78 large coffins and 93 small coffins to the New Puyutang, 26 large coffins to the Jiangsu Second Prison, and 24 large coffins and 39 small coffins to hospitals and at the gate. It buried 99 large coffins and 222 small coffins. 2) The French Concession branch provided 54 large coffins and 102 small coffins. It buried 59 large coffins and 254 small coffins. 3) The Tongren Fu Yuan Hall Rescue Bureau provided 2 large coffins and 61 small coffins. It buried 9 large coffins and 118 small coffins. The above statistics show that a total of 184 large coffins and 295 small coffins were provided in one month, and 167 large coffins and 594 small coffins were buried. The burial sites are located in the cemetery at Liuli Bridge in Pudong, each marked with the deceased's name, awaiting family identification.</p>
<p>The French Concession Tongren Fu Yuan Branch specializes in collecting and burying unidentified bodies from roadsides, hospitals, prisons, and other places within the French Concession, as well as collecting abandoned children's bodies and providing coffins year-round. It is now the 70th anniversary of its founding. Since Mr. Qin Shounong took over as director of the hall last spring, he has made great efforts to reorganize it, such as adding vehicles for transporting bodies, revising work regulations, and taking over the collection of unidentified bodies from hospitals in the Public Concession. Its achievements have been widely praised. It is reported that the hall's annual expenses have increased by about 10,000 yuan, with the coffin provision program requiring 5,000 yuan annually, and the burial of large and small bodies exceeding 5,000. The number does not include those who have families who provide their own coffins for burial.</p>
<p>The authorities encourage and promote this charitable undertaking, and benevolent people offer assistance and donations. The French Concession authorities, including the French Consul General's Office, the French Municipal Council, and the French Public Court, are enthusiastic about promoting charitable affairs within the concession and provide annual funding of 4,000 yuan. Furthermore, generous benefactors have donated approximately 400 yuan. The Siming Public Association donates 60 large wooden coffins annually (divided into three installments of 20 coffins each), with other items not included. This can truly be described as a dedication to public service and universal compassion. All sectors of society express their admiration and gratitude, which is worthy of recording. Additionally, the vehicles used by the hall's staff for official business, as well as the trucks and bicycles used to transport coffins and collect children's bodies, are issued permits by the Public Works Departments of both the English and French Concessions free of charge year-round, demonstrating their sincere commitment to philanthropy and promoting harmony. In 1930, a total of 677 large coffins and 4,613 small coffins were buried, totaling 5,390 coffins of all sizes, which were transported for burial to the tomb area in Pudong.</p>

<p>An examination of the market conditions for various bonds in Shanghai since the beginning of the National Calendar reveals that futures trading has been active. On Wednesday and Thursday, trading volumes reached 9 million yuan each day. On Tuesday and the weekend, trading volumes reached 6.8 to 6.9 million yuan each day. Only Monday was relatively flat. The price fluctuations were greater than at the end of the previous year. From Monday to Wednesday, sellers flooded the market, and demand was weak, causing bond prices to fall. The disarmament, demobilization, 1921 Customs, 1921 Relief, Consolidated Six, and other bonds fell significantly. The surge in gold prices and the chaos in international exchange rates widened the gap between gold and silver prices. Although the national fixed tariffs have been implemented, their impact on future customs revenues is likely to be significant, causing anxiety among market participants. On Thursday, bond prices had fallen significantly, and buyers became slightly more active, causing prices to rise across the board. The trend gradually stabilized over the weekend, and although prices continued to rise, the gains were small. As a result, prices generally retreated from the end of the previous year. The Consolidated Six and Disarmament bonds fell by as much as 2 yuan, and other bonds fell by smaller amounts. Total transaction volume for the week was 44.451 million, with 1921 Customs and Disarmament bonds being the most active, accounting for 11.71 million and 11.475 million yuan respectively. 1921 Relief bonds accounted for 6.885 million yuan, Demobilization bonds accounted for 5.955 million yuan, 1927 Public Bonds accounted for 5.11 million yuan, Consolidated Six bonds accounted for 2.055 million yuan, and other bonds were minimal.</p>
<p>Specifics were: Customs Bonds 730,000 yuan, 1919 Bonds 350,000 yuan, 1918 Bonds 200,000 yuan, Financial Bonds 25,000 yuan, Disaster Relief 10,000 yuan, and the rarely traded Bonds of 1915 also traded for 5,000 yuan. Spot trading was minimal, with total transaction volume for the week at 143,900 yuan. 1921 Customs bonds accounted for 92,100 yuan, Demobilization and Disarmament bonds accounted for over 20,000 yuan each, Disaster Relief bonds accounted for 16,000 yuan, and other bonds accounted for only a few thousand yuan each. The following table lists the high, low, and changes in prices for various bonds over the past week. All bonds except the Disaster Relief and 1918 bonds include both principal and interest. The Disaster Relief and 1918 bonds exclude interest. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>The dramatic rise in the cotton yarn market last week, during the New Year holiday, was unprecedented in recent times. This was due to the possibility of a one-and-a-half-month extension for money changers to settle accounts, which eased financial constraints, and the fact that factory exit taxes had not yet been implemented, allowing each bale of yarn to reach its destination without incurring 5-6 taels in taxes. As a result, traders vigorously sought supplies and urged the prompt shipment of existing stock. This had already improved the situation from last year. At the beginning of this year, the exchange rate fluctuated wildly, and gold prices soared, causing cotton prices to rise sharply, and the yarn market followed suit. Sellers were uneasy about this situation, and small investors were forced to cover their short positions, leading to this intense surge in the market. The pressure on sellers was too great, and the favorable news exacerbated the situation. Fortunately, Chaozhou and Japanese traders had not yet covered their short positions. The price of yarn for each month was 5-6 taels higher than last year, and the number of transactions was approximately 230,000 bales. Detailed figures will be provided later. Traders purchased approximately 7-8,000 bales of spot yarn this week. Traders purchased approximately 6-70,000 bales of forward yarn. Therefore, the bullish forces are very strong. Currently, the bulls and bears are fiercely competing. However, the overseas yarn market is average, and the market is temporarily still in a state of turmoil. It is feared that fluctuations may be unpredictable.</p>
<p>The surge in the cotton market last week was driven by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which caused the combined price of foreign cotton to rise sharply in relation to the Chinese currency. Local spot supplies were weak, and there was a lack of sources from various regions. Buyers intended to force sellers to cover their short positions. Therefore, the market secretly rose. In December, the margin calls reached 5 taels, and sellers were very hesitant. This year, gold prices have soared, and the short positions have increased dramatically, causing panic among small investors, who covered their positions at any cost, causing prices to rise from 2.7 qian to 5.3 qian. During these six days, the daily transaction volume was approximately 70,000 to 80,000 dan. This situation was due to the lack of deliverable standard goods and the large number of short positions. Although foreign cotton was weak, sellers were unprepared, and once the situation erupted, it was difficult to sustain. The price of each month was 2 taels higher than last year.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: Factories were slightly more active, with sources including 1,500 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 2,000 bales of Yao cotton, and 1,050 bales of Dongtai cotton. Factories purchased 23,365 dan, and trading companies purchased 2,200 dan. The volume of purchases by each factory is recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Grain: The Rice Market Remains Stable Despite the Cold Weather <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The weather yesterday in Zhabei was extremely cold and freezing, resulting in a significant reduction in supplies from the Lu Li Road. Sales in all directions were also sluggish on the 10th or so. The price of the special top grade remained at 13 yuan 8 jiao, while the market price was only around 13 yuan 5 jiao. The overall trend can be described as stable. The arrival and sales of thin tao were both sluggish, with no gains or losses. The best-selling rice was sheep xiang, with zero gut being especially popular. Prices were stable. The top grade was about to reach 13 yuan. The price of Du bu xiang was not as vibrant as sheep xiang, but the market shape was still active. Prices were consistent and stable. The supply of bian yuan he was limited, and sales were sluggish. The situation was stable. The day's trading was light, with little fluctuation in prices and a slight increase in transaction volume.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from rivers to Shanghai South was scarce. West and south roads saw few arrivals. Chang geng continued to be in short supply, so the price of 13 yuan for goods on the market was considered the market peak. However, in reality, special geng required 13 yuan 3-4 jiao. Suzhou and Tongzhou special geng was rare, and sales were sluggish. Store gut were flat, and country sales were also weak. It was generally not easy to raise prices. However, the consecutive cold days inevitably led to firmness. The buying of early thin dao and early rice in the southern area was light. Very few Yong gu were imported. The market was tight, and the market situation was clearly stable. The price of high-quality sheep du was firm, while the price of middle and lower-quality goods was stagnant. The supply of bai yuan he was not abundant, and there were few top-quality goods. Therefore, the price of tong bian barely held steady, while the price of yin hua slightly declined.</p>

<p>The opening price of the Red Board Standard Futures Soybean was soft because of the unexpected changes that took place in Dalian. Stockowners were frantically throwing out beans for each period which caused the price to sharply reverse direction. This move roused panic in the hearts of the local gang of brokers and those from the interior. Old bull orders and new short orders went out together with weakness in the market such as had never been seen before. The price slid down to more than three qian in two days with sales reaching more than 400 cars. At this time, the market's eye was unanimously on four liang. After the situation settled on Wednesday, there was a slight covering of earlier short positions. Prices strengthened slightly. After that, on Thursday, the price suddenly turned around because margin rates were ceaselessly rising and at the same time Western brokerages in Dalian were showing interest and starting to move up. This made everyone happy. Homes continued to cover and oil manufacturers and carters began to buy. Prices proceeded tightly till over the weekend when, because of a telegram from Dalian reporting prices up by a jiao, the situation became very active. Buying became open and unobstructed. Nearby and later contracts all rose by 7-8 fen and the price opened up the barrier of 4 liang 5 qian. The volume of exchange transactions has already greatly increased and has now reached over 2000 cars. Parties everywhere have been paying increased attention to the bean market. Hereunder is a listing of prices after the red board (units are in liang):</p>

<p>The opening price for the Red Board Standard Soybean Cake followed the bean market downstream, and because the Gang from Dalian was frantically throwing out beans for various periods the cake market rapidly declined. Dealers from the interior and those dealing in re-exports were all watching what would happen, and the situation during the first half of the week saw a price decrease of near a qian which had never been seen at the start of past years. Because margin rates were soaring ceaselessly after Thursday, the inner areas and the local hoarders and brokers actively sought to advance the market, there was frantic short covering, Lianfang's market price was announced to be rising, Western brokerages were entering the market one after the other, and paper money was costing a fortune, the situation turned to great profits. Prices rose in segments from the lowest amount and were a great deal more than seven or eight fen high. The speed of change was beyond what had been anticipated. Observing the situation over the weekend, it is not easy for cake prices to fall. The following is a listing of comparative prices (units in liang):</p>

<p>Since the sugar market opened on the 5th, after the New Year's holidays, it has been rising because international prices have gone up and production areas have reported rising wind. Merchants everywhere have said that since customs duties in the interior have been recalled, purchases have been surging ahead and the atmosphere is even better. Every type of sugar has been taking flight and flourishing. Raw sand and white prices are above 10 liang, which is the highest price since the start of the year. Dutch Red is also tracking this and now costs more than 9 liang. Ice flower and clear are also above 9 liang 2 qian. The rise in local ice is even sharper and has risen to 12 liang 6 qian. Japanese sugar is also stepping up higher, and even though a great deal of goods are arriving at the end of the year, this hasn't had the slightest impact on the market atmosphere because demand has been quite strong and where people's desires are, prices are surging high. 8-number three-heat-and-a-half has reached its highest price of 10 liang 07 qian, and prices compared to the end of the year are already up more than 1 liang which is a record for the sugar market at the start of the year.</p>
<p>At yesterday's market draw made by the guild, the atmosphere for 24-Number Dutch raw sugar was quite strong at first with demand still vigorous. The price for transactions was 10 liang 6 qian ban, and the buying and selling of Hong Kong goods at 10 liang 05 qian ban was still busy. After this, because spot prices on the board lot were abundant, the later market was leveled off a bit as a result. 20-Number middle-sand white cost 10 liang, which was also not remarkable. The price of 8-Number Dutch Red at 9 liang 2 qian ban was quite sprightly. Japanese sugar was also showing price steps. N Mark was at 10 liang 08 qian ban and was still running out. Y T Mark was at 10 liang 06 qian ban to 7 qian. Y P Mark was at 11 liang 1 qian and bright China goods were at 11 liang. Y P O Mark was at 10 liang 02 qian to 2 qian ban. The market atmosphere was firm and still up a qian compared to before. Local ice prices were up by 3 qian because manufacturers everywhere were announcing quite a lot of ice. The Shanghai factory announced that Jen Character Ice was selling for 13 liang 9 qian and Dry Character was at 13 liang 8 qian. The Zhonghua factory announced that Zhong Character ice was selling for 13 liang 9 qian and a large bag of ice was selling for 13 liang 2 qian. These two houses each reported selling over 1000 packages. The new factory Guohua sold 700 packages at the same price. Markets everywhere were agile. There was no trade because prices were being cried up high in board lots for all colors. The asking price for ice flower clear was 10 liang. The asking price for new clear sugar was 8 liang 2 qian but there were still few offers. Huaxin company opened up and announced that they had 3000 sacks of spot raw white with a price of 10 liang 06 qian ban.</p>

<p>Painting Research Institute to Hold Exhibition</p>
<p>The 5th Practice Exhibition of White Goose Painting Research Institute should have been held at the end of the 19th year of the Republic era. However, the affairs of the institute will have major improvements and expansions from the spring term of this year. In order to have a long-term consideration of various new plans, the exhibition had to be postponed. At the same time, considering the shallow impression of general vocational school achievement exhibitions, we are even more unwilling to hastily deal with it by mixing in it. The institute is a painting research group founded in Shanghai. Although the history is only two years, the spirit is strict and the achievements are unique. It has long enjoyed a good reputation in society. The cooperative preparations and the 5th practice paintings are even more seen only in previous exhibitions. It is reported that the exhibition date is scheduled for around the 20th of this month, and a strict review and display of each painting is underway.</p>

<p>Junyi Middle School, founded by Wu Kaixian and others from the Municipal Committee on Guohuo Road in this city, has been progressing rapidly in the past two years. The number of students has increased sharply to around six hundred this semester. Principal Pan Gongzhan believes that it will be difficult to complete the new school building in a short period of time, so if he wants to accommodate so many students, he can only temporarily rent a branch school. It is reported that the school has rented ten new houses next to the school. Because everything needs to be arranged, the school's Academic Affairs Director Huang Zaoxiong, General Affairs Director Zhou Yongnan, Moral Education Director Huang Xuchu, and High School Directors He Ziguo and Luo Yingxiong are quite busy purchasing equipment for the additional classes.</p>

<p>Zhou Xianyan's Performance Amazes the Entire Field</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai team's plan to go north for the interport soccer game has been cancelled, the southern expedition to Hong Kong is still a must. In order to select the Shanghai team players, the Westerners Football Club held a trial match at 3:00 PM yesterday. The famous players of Shanghai gathered and competed, which was quite a sight. As a result, both teams scored three goals each, as recorded on the left.</p>

<p>After the heavy snow, the weather suddenly turned cold, and everyone thought that the competition would not be held. However, it proceeded as usual. Since both teams are the most famous teams in Shanghai, soccer fans were not afraid of the severe cold and flocked to Shen Garden, with about a thousand people. The cold wind cut their faces, and the cold air pierced their bones, but they still sat precariously to enjoy the soccer skills. It can be said that they are truly fans.</p>

<p>There were minor differences between the generals who played and those disclosed in the newspaper. Bi Qin and Martin replaced the left and right fullbacks of the Zha Xu team. Huang Mao Baodeheng was injured in the leg during the match with the Hong Kong Army, so He Lai was temporarily appointed. There were also changes in the Gu Shitai team, as listed below.</p>
<p>Zha Xu Team</p>
<p>La Sheng</p>
<p>De Fei Tou Na</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Shu Ding Zha Xu Kelasha</p>

<p>All twenty-two soldiers are famous generals on the battlefield, so the performance is naturally extraordinary. Unfortunately, due to the cold weather and frozen ground with unmelted snow, there were times when they slipped and were inevitably affected. In terms of performance, the Zha Xu team had more complete talent and was better than the Gu Shitai team. Gu Shitai was listed as left forward, so people said that he was being used for a minor task. The central defender of Zha Xu, supplemented by He Lei and De Fei, was like an iron fence. The center forward of Kelasha and the right wing of Fafanqie need no further explanation. The Gu Shitai team was better at offense than defense. Sinclair and Wo Kelai's shooting skills were unique and were praised by the entire field. Zhou Xianyan's iron gate, static to disrupt the enemy, relaxed to wait, and accepting adversity, was the reason why Sinclair and Wo Kelai's feet did not succeed. Who else but Zhou's merit? However, Blatran's goalkeeper was playful and stared blankly, and could not be compared.</p>
