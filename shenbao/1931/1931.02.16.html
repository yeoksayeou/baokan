<p>時評</p>
<h3>西班牙政變</h3>
<p>自來政變之機發動甚微。政黨之互丰攻訐議會之迭起爭鬭有時形勢。雖極嚴重。然皆不足視爲動搖國本之危機而獨於多數民衆無形中輿論之所表示。實爲人心嚮背所繫。初視之若無甚勢力。然日久即成爲世界最堅强之物。世界强有力政府。或忽不加意。或以極嚴厲之手段拘束之。自謂當無敢反抗者。迨一有間隙可乘。其倒也易於摧枯拉朽如西班牙之貝倫圭内聞。就任之初。雖欲爲緩和民心計。宣言决不效前獨裁内閣里夫拉之所爲。然其後所行之政策仍一如前内閣之専斷仍惟西王之命是聽。其危機早已隱伏故不旋踵而人民之共和運動即起。反對帝制之呼聲日高。革命風潮與罷工風潮。連續而起。循環不已。貝倫圭將軍挾其軍隊之力與保王黨之助。竭全力以壓迫民衆之反動非特無效。而反以促新派勢力之速成。今者貝倫圭之内閣。已不得已而辭職矣。召集選民大會之議將實現矣。請求國王退位之說亦日盛矣。西班牙帝制命運之告終。共和政治之開始。或將於此次政變定之。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>此次貝倫圭閣内辭職共和黨運動雖已告勝利。但以後行動。尤宜注意。前自由黨總裁紫摩拉博士有言。國王必須遜位。惟共和黨舉動。宜避免引起内爭。與因他故而發生意外之糾紛。此言誠爲扼要。苟今日之共和黨而忽不加察。則西班牙之前途。仍未可樂觀矣。</p>

<h3>新加坡總領事唐榴報告僑况</h3>
<p>失業華人時被警察拘捕</p>
<p>英政府禁三民主義課程</p>
<p>金文泰實行取締國民黨</p>
<p>日日社云、外交部外交討論委員會、在前晚假銀行公會、開三十四次常會時、除討論自來水等要案外、并有新近回國之新加坡總領唐榴君、報告該地僑况、茲特誌之如次、以下爲唐君言、</p>
<p>此次蒙部長派鄙人到本會來、得與諸位先生時常親近、此後鄙人智識、當日有增加、至深榮幸、至新加坡僑務情形、在座諸位、多是前輩、當已盡悉、旣承諄囑、謹將鄙人在職時所知大槪情形、報告於諸位之前、</p>
<p>商務情形　馬來半島、華僑以經營樹膠及錫礦爲多、在早年凡經營此種商業者、無不致富、乃近半年來、價格低落、以致市面大衰、金融甚滯、雖英政府對於英屬地方、有停止割膠、藉以提高價格之意、因他處未能合作、效力甚徵、以致膠價仍無起色、因此其餘僑商、亦受影響、感受痛苦、而失業工人、亦日見增加、鄙人未離職之前、對於救濟失業工人辦法、曾與中華總商會及華僑中之熱心公益者多人、討論多次、總想暫時維持彼等之生活、嗣因籌此鉅欵、實屬不易、乃陸續　送回國、同時英政府鑒於馬來半島失業工人之多、乃有限制華工入口之辦法、其中有許多失業工人、改充小販爲生、但是項小販、時常被該地警察拘捕、其原因有三、（一）知識淺薄、不明警章、（二）希圖自己取巧、故違警章、（三）警察所欲不遂、故意逮捕、關於小販問題、頗爲麻煩、彼等毫無常識、甚至本不違犯警章、因當堂言語錯誤、致被處罰、鄙人乃將警章譯印多張、四處分散、一面又延律師、代爲辯護、鄙人復向當地政府交涉、嗣後此種小販問題、稍稍安靜、</p>
<p>敎育狀况　馬來半島、華僑學校敎育、較前確有進步、惟各校經費、多半由董事捐助、或向僑商募振、亦有受當地政府之津貼、至敎育行政權、均歸董事部、鄙人僅就可能範圍内指導之、其所用敎科書、多遵照敎育部之規定書籍、惟三民主義一書、該地政府、多所顧忌、曾被禁用、雖經交涉、而該政府仍不允變通、現在各校課程表上、已不列此科目、僅用口頭敎授、所缺憾者、該處學校敎育、無敎育機關之統糸、從前有一敎育會、因學校罷課風潮、影響停止、鄙人前擬設一敎育會、附設領事館、以期華僑敎育行政、得以統一、嗣因離職、此議中止、</p>
<p>黨務近狀　前坡督未去任時、對於黨務、祗要無違反治安之事、不加干涉、縱有時黨部被搜查、以後經鄙人交涉、立將搜去之文件發還領館轉交、旣而前坡督去職、新任金文泰接事、彼以治香港之政策治殖民地、對於黨務、非常注意、其時黨部開選舉會、彼即藉口取締之、現在黨務工作、仍不能公開、幾經交涉、彼均以有許多顧慮爲辭、不允變通、</p>
<p>治安大槪　該處尙稱安謐、惟共黨甚多、該政府捕獲後、監禁數月、即驅逐回國、此外華僑中有一種私會、常作械鬥、互相殘殺、鄙人雖迭次勸解、奈彼等冥頑不靈、不可以理喩之、</p>
<p>引渡問題　我國常有一種刑事犯逃至英屬各地、欲求引渡回國辦理、該政府總以我國未與彼國訂立引渡條約　辭而拒絕之、此條約我國與彼國有無訂立之必要、利害如何、請諸位討論之、</p>
<p>國籍問題　此問題極困難、在英政府認爲華人生長於彼屬地者、爲英籍、在我國國籍法、其父爲中國人、或其父無可攷、而其母爲中國人者、即認爲中國人、因此常發生糾紛、惟有最不明瞭者、生長於英屬殖民地之華人、持英政府之護照回中國、到中國後、在我國統治權以内、當然行使我國國籍法、認爲中國人、似不能容彼等受駐中國之外國領事保護、關於此點、究竟如何、請諸位討論之、</p>
<p>以上報告、僅擇其大略、還請諸位指敎云云、</p>

<h3>海格路血案略有端倪</h3>
<p>事因調戲婦女而起</p>
<p>崔秉鈞抱不平遇害</p>
<p>小黑炭實不無可疑</p>
<p>山東人崔秉鈞（即老七）、於前晨三時許、被人暗殺在滬西海格路金生記成衣店門前、已誌昨報、茲將被殺原因錄下、</p>
<p>崔之略歷　崔秉鈞（即老七）年卅七歲、山東觀陶人、住海格路海格里四十八號樓下、弟崔貞、現在市公安局六區二所充當三等警士、父死、家有七十餘歲之老母劉氏、妻平氏、年四十歲、在附近套鞋廠爲女工、祗遺九歲孤女桂英、家用悉由平氏工資維持、生活甚爲貧苦、昨報載崔老七生前放印子錢生意、係傳聞之悞、並非事實、</p>
<p>徒弟呼寃　出事後、由該管六區二分所所長劉雲舫至出事地點查勘一過、兇手係在金生記成衣店隔壁荒地上預伏（沿馬路圍有竹笆）、遂傳屍到所詢問、旋據死者之徒弟吳小章（綽號噼佩孚）投所聲稱、先生（即老七）在日並無仇人、且對於弟兄朋友、向無惡感、與往居鎭上聯發里十六號本地人徐姓交好、今晨得知先生被殺後、即往徐處詢問、據云老七於昨晨十時許出去、復至孝友里口匯記脚踏車樓上吸烟、直至前晨二時許出來、在順興館吃點心、回家時、見後面有不相識之三四人跟隨、崔不疑有他、行至金生記成衣店門前、被人暗殺、</p>
<p>被殺原因　旋又聲稱、此次先生被殺、實係在逃之小黑炭（即曹根發）等糾衆謀害、緣一月前小黑炭（即曹根發）與姜阿福在長樂灘簧塲因調戲婦女口角、以致發生械鬥、後由先生（即老七）帮同姜阿福將小黑炭打傷、恐因此懷恨在心、將先生殺害、且小黑炭夫婦二人、於十三日晚十時許、先後至先生家中樓上吸烟、（樓上係某甲所開之燕子窠）現查得小黑炭近來住在海格里後面台司德郎路匯民旅館已有多日、出事後、相偕逃逸、有本地人胡大毛狗亦與小黑炭交好、曹根發現匿何處、諒必知情、先生在日曾向胡之岳母借洋五十元、向不追索、近二三日來、胡大毛狗向先生屢次索還該欵、可知胡早已知悉先生之遇害、恐該欵無着故也、以上種種原因、先生被殺、胡大毛狗定知詳情、</p>
<p>搜查兇犯　劉所長據報後、立派袁巡官至善鐘路法捕房、派捕至匯民旅館查緝、旋據該棧茶房云、曹根發於本月六日、帶領男女六七人、開十四號十六號兩房間、至十一日忽改名祝根發、至十四日晨二時許、突有二人入内、喚起根發之妻出外、至今未回、臨行時、形色忽忙、並向隔壁亞細亞汽車公司租車一輛、向東疾駛而去等語、後在房間内搜查一過、並無他物、祗遺留洋傘兩把、破鞋一雙、回所中再核、</p>

<h3>縣曹塘北顓馬五鄕人士對於遷治地點意見</h3>
<p>上海縣縣治遷移問題、自促成會曁設計委員會成立後、積極進行、實現有期、惟以縣治地點一案、雖經迭次會議、而仍未决定、茲悉縣屬曹行·塘灣·北橋·顓橋·馬橋·等五鄕人士、咸主張新縣治之地點、設在兪塘以北最合宜、乃由設計委員鈕長耀·施舍·彭利人·三君、擬具意見及詳細圖說、以備參考、茲將全文探誌如下、</p>
<p>查縣治地點一案、業經本會多次會議、尚未决定、誠以設治地點、爲全縣新建設这第一步、攸關將來事業發展、百年大計、自當　重研究、仔細觀察、前次分組審查、曾由大會推定長耀等、擔任塘北組研究、當經擬具意見、提交會議、惟時日忽忽、未遑詳加說明、茲經長耀等再度討論、重履勘、仍認縣治地點設在俞塘以北、實爲較妥、爰將研究意見、連同設計圖說、補充如左、查縣治地點之定在滬閔路以東、俞塘以北、民國十八年間、江蘇省政府早有定案、蓋不僅以地位之適宜、亦所以顧全各方之發展、此次各區人士、發起遷治論後、亦從無議　俞塘以南之地、非不知俞塘以南、儘多餘地、足供新治建設之用、誠恐愈趨愈南、益背中心之旨、今者縣府當局謹愼從事、仍將地點問題、交會討論、正亦以地方事業發展攸關不厭求詳、鄭重研究、用心殊堪欽佩、長耀等係地方人士、深知全縣之地勢、各區之情形、决不敢偏執徇私、有所成見、但求遷治問題早日實現、新上海縣之建設早日進行、毌負中外交通知名之地望、以慰全邑民衆數年來之企求、爲敢不辭謭陋、謹遵原議、聊貢一得、以資參考、（甲）設治地點應绾全縣水陸交推之總樞、（一）全縣水道、就浦西言、縱有横瀝·沙法租·岡·三幹河、横有俞塘·六磊塘·華涇港·三幹河、就浦東言、則有周浦塘·三林塘·二幹河、而各幹河中、尤以横瀝爲最優良最重要之水港、蓋南自黃浦進口、經閔行·北橋·顓橋·莘莊·七寳、而北人吳淞江、沿河各市集、皆賴以爲貨物運輸之要道、蜿蜓數十里、利用之處正多、設治地點、自以愈近此河爲上策、沙竹二岡河道雖亦寬闊、惟沿岸殊少市集且偏西南、縣治之欲頼以利用者較少、故縣治之應在俞塘以北、其理由至爲明顯（二）全縣東西流各幹河、雖以海潮關係、易於淤塞、然均爲聯絡各區之重要水道、如俞塘西經馬橋而通松江、声經塘灣而出黃浦、如六磊塘西自松江、經顓橋曹行及内外車　而出黃浦、正接周浦塘、經塘口陳行、直通周浦、如華涇港西連春申塘·經莘莊·翁板橋·華涇·而出黄浦、斜接三林塘、直達三林鎭、設治於俞塘北地、藉横瀝之縱貫、於此三幹河、已得較近較便之利且爲浦西數鄕水道之中心、可與浦東二區、呵成一氣、（三）全縣陸道、已成者有滬閔路·北匯路·滬閔路自東北入境、向西南經錢糧　·顓橋·北橋·而至閔行、北匯路自北橋起、沿俞塘北岸、西經馬橋·直達匯橋、而通松江、其不久即須興工建築者、有北塘路、自北橋起、亦沿俞塘北岸、而東達　灣、並依縣建設局已定之計劃、自北塘路、延長至外車　過黃浦而接天塘路、自塘口起築、經陳行·顓橋、而至天花菴、與上南汽車路　接、而長閔路自市區長橋起、經關港·外車溝·窑廠·而至閔行、更爲縣境沿浦南北相通之要道、此後計劃實現、尤得與浦東二區、脈絡貫通、統觀已成及計劃中之各路、其總樞在俞塘之北、故設治地點、低亦以北爲比較適宜、以上三點、僅就俞塘北地水陸交通而言、茲更以兩地情勢爲一簡單之比較、（一）俞塘南地離横瀝較遠、雖云接近竹岡、但仍有三里之相隔、加以流域不廣、水線不長、而偏於縣境西南、更無聯絡全縣重要市集之地位、與其移南偏西、而兩失其利、不若就北移東、而専用其一、（二）俞塘南地、東西幹河、悉落於後、不若北地之前後分列、加愉橫瀝縱貫其間、旣得聯絡貫通之實利、又得前後環繞之優勢、（三）俞塘南地、陸道交通、僅恃滬閔一路、雖云北匯北塘、分繞於後、然中隔俞塘一河、北橋一鎭、究不如俞塘北地之切近、且全縣陸道交通之總樞、當在俞塘以北、而不在俞塘以南、事至明顯、按之建設局已定之計劃而可知、徵之已成之北匯路而可見、舍近圖遠、似非所宜、（乙）縣治地點、應顧及將來各方面之發展、縣治地點爲全縣重心、對於將來發展、自應多方兼顧、設不虚心研究、審愼考慮、則毫厘之差、千里之謬、始謀不威、後悔何及、今試就學理事實地形以及發展之趨勢、分别言之、何去何從、當有定理、（一）就學理論、地理學家有言、山南爲陽、山北爲陰、水北爲陽、水南爲陰、故各種建築、在山則取南而舍北、在水則取北而舍南、　諸斯義、新縣治之建築、似在俞塘之北爲宜、（二）就理實論、本縣各市鎭之位置、莫不在各幹河之北、如塘北馬三鎭之在俞塘以北、顓橋鎭之在六磊塘以北、陳行塘口題橋三鎭之在周浦塘以北、三林鎭之在三林塘以北、即閔行鎭之發展、亦未始非面臨黃浦之故、徵之事實、則本縣新治之建築、當在俞塘以北、更無疑義、（三）就地形論、俞塘南地本身雖屬平坦、而地位不廣、東西兩面、農村密集、墳墓壘壘、障碍極多、且地勢高低不平、欲謀發展、事殊不易、而北橋鎭梗阻於後、即竭力建設、亦恐重於西南、而輕於東北、形成畸形之局面、反觀俞塘北地、地勢空曠、範圍寬展、如向橫涇東西開柘、廣袤不下十數方里、地盤之廣、遠勝於南、且地位適中、一俟新治觀成、則閔馬北顓曹塘各鎭、分立於前後左右、如衆星之環拱、規模宏遠氣勢雄偉、尤非偏踞一隅、所可同語、（四）以發展之趨勢論、上海一市、爲全國繁盛之區、世界知名之地、是以各地水陸空交通運輸事業之設施、均趨向上海市方面、依總理大上海之計劃、縣區盡歸市屬之内、是縣與市本屬一家、此時晚宜力謀與市區接近、而日漸繁榮、非但本縣道路之終點、應集中於市、即新縣治區域發展之趨勢、亦應趨向於市、今縣區旣居市境之西南、縣治自宜注重於東北之發展、藉圖共進、諒無疑義、而設治地點之移南向西、與就北向東之孰得孰失、已能權其輕重、明其大槪、上述各點、僅就全縣水陸交通之實况與將來發展之趨勢而言、俞塘北地較近中心、設治地點、誠能以愈近中心爲愈佳、欲控制全縣、宜近中心、欲保衛各地、宜近中心、欲聯終各區、宜近中心、欲謀整個發展宜近中心、總之全縣地勢盡屬平陽、旣無高山峻嶺、又無長江大河、形勢旣鮮特殊、障碍可云絕少、俞塘南北、相去無幾、此之便利、未始彼之長處、彼以窒碍、未始非此之缺點、憑地形之調查、就四境之觀察、於權衡比較之中、重爲詳細之研究、是否有當、諸祈公鑒、</p>

<h3>雪中思古錄</h3>
<p>荆·夢·蝶·</p>
<p>連朝飛雪。急景催人。鄕路迢遙。覊心懭悢。不得已呵凍箋愁。拈毫製恨。就雪中故事。世所習知而多趣者。略舉數則。託思古之幽情。遣感時之寒意。或亦圍爐覔醉者之一談助云爾。</p>
<p>詠雪　雪景爲天然詩料。古來詠雪佳句。不可勝述。而最著名者莫如謝家一女。「世說」謝太傅寒雪日集内庭。對雪吟曰。白雪紛紛何所似。兄子胡兒曰。撒鹽空中差可擬。小女道韞曰。未若柳絮因風起。公亟賞之。一句遂壓倒千古。而出於小女子。泃天才也。余嘗咏其事有句云。珠玉天敎傳素口。聰明人自寫冰心。</p>
<p>映雪　「藝文類聚」孫康空貧。冬夜不能具膏火。常映雪以照讀書。乃千古學者之好模範也。今人室中。電炬光明如畫。而書籍束之高閣。豈不大負良宵燈火。有慙衾影多已。</p>
<p>臥雪「高士傳」焦先臥雪。以草廬被焚故。然不如袁安之事趣。洛陽大雪。積地丈餘。守令行至安門。無有行路。謂安已死。除雪入戶。見安僵臥。問何不出。安曰。大雪人皆餓。不宜干人。令以爲賢。舉爲邦廉。是令亦賢者也。處令世而爲安者。則惟有凍餓以死耳。余蔡焦桐曾詠之云。不信寒威侵鐵骨。儘多春意伴梅花。蔡亦寒士。故詠來能體會入微也。</p>
<p>煑雪　煑雪成茗。其味最清。水分中一塵不染也。昔陶學士買得黨太尉家姬。遇雪。令取雪烹茶。因謂之曰。黨家應不識此。姬曰。彼粗人。但能於銷金帳中。淺斟低唱。飲羊羔美酒耳。余謂姬何風雅至是。茲數日雪中。海上富人。何一非黨太尉。幸所擁者。絕無黨姬其人。故只是歡娛。不逢訕笑耳。</p>
<h3>雪中登古華山</h3>
<p>賀·天·健·</p>
<p>連日大雪。積地可二尺餘。　處矮屋。忽動登册之興。於玉鱗紛飛之中。登古華山絕頂以試遠眺。在他人眼中能不笑我爲痴乎。先余御車至册麓。回顧平疇。一白無際。仰瞻峯巒。銀裝玉琢。上籠白雲。幾疑通天。掩山松杉。不辨枝柯。盡成瓊堆瑤阜。爲余有生以來未見之奇景也。爾時鳥絕人無。但覺造化與余。相接於自然之間。余乃吸履攀登而上。如掌雪花與余鏖戰。鼓余勇氣。衝冐直入。不爲所阻。此亦余戰勝自然之一紀錄也。始從之徑。微有形跡。及逾山麓。乃迷惘難測矣。旣思凡余經過之處。必有履痕可尋歸途似可無恐。乃直上不顧。經幾次顚蹶。始知雪上有波折形者。下必爲危石。無波折形而平舖如輭棉者。下必爲土窪。或爲平地。得此敎訓。遂轉危爲安。始抵山腰。神稍定。展眸遠望。不意適間所駭爲奇景者。至此乃覺爲不奇。誠如河伯之望洋。而不知如何矣。接余目而所呈之狀。有如混沌未鑿。城郭湖山更從何處審别。但見白茫茫一片。幾難此身在白雲海中。此時風尤緊。雪更密。雲益低。下視所從之徑。並履痕而無之矣。余乃大駭。將何從而歸乎。而所處之地。已在最險峻之境。余正危急時。耳際忽聞吃吃笑語聲。跡其聲之所自似在西崦澗中。瞭之。果見隱約有二三少女。穿靑色布衣。狀若學生。適以雪没山徑。亦迷所從出。余乃詢以澗水流處。有無路徑可尋。曰余等來時尙有。今皆爲雪淹没矣。且招余至彼處同行。噫。境旣奇而遇更奇矣。豈意此中亦有與余同好奇者。余擬往同行。旋以空山無人。男女有所不便。余乃語之曰。余且下。君等可從余行處而步。以免危險。於是余乃冒險而下。抵平地。返視彼等。亦趦趄而從吾後矣。此奇遇也。烏可以不記。</p>
<h3>雪中奠基記</h3>
<p>程·志·政·</p>
<p>交通大學工程館。自破土動工以來。工程進展甚速。十四日該校特舉行奠基典禮。到鐵道部長孫哲生。日本代理公使重光葵等數百人。其間頗多可記。茲擇錄一二。以蠁閱者。</p>
<p>粉搓玉琢之銀世界　是日適逢大雪。地上積雪盈尺。而整個之交通大學。遂成銀世界。十時許來賓陸續而至。汽車蜿蜒如長蚊。而汽車上下。亦呈奇觀。洵盛會中之盛事也。</p>
<p>孫部長殷勤致意。十時假第一敎室開會。由校長黎照寰氏主席。孫部長訓話。孫氏御皮大衣。演說時態度極爲從容。而意義則彌爲懇切。孫氏云。本校之擴充計劃甚鉅。工程館不過實行之一端。本校在精神上歷史上有可認爲满意。然物質上亦不能不同時進展。目前國家社會。需要建設人材甚殷其責任完全在本校。希望大家手工程館落成後益潛心研究學術。以期無負於國家云云。中齒清晰。言語得體。聽者咸爲之動容。</p>
<p>雪中觀禮　會畢。主席邀各來賓至工程館參加奠禮。於是中西人士咸冒雪出發。衣衫盡成銀色。抵工成館後。由工人將基石取出。由孫部長安放。基石爲白大理石。孫部長摩挲良久。同時爆竹聲軍樂聲大作。典禮亦於是告成。</p>
<p>有趣味之攝影　禮畢。舉行攝影。機械學院院長王繩善氏高聲語數外賓曰。速來參加此有趣味之攝影。雪中奇景。不可多得也。衆咸囅然。爭就而攝焉。</p>
<p>日公使之閒適　來賓中有日本代理公使重光葵氏。觀禮旣畢。緩步出上院。時汽車停於路上。公使從容冒雪得車。黎照寰氏亦鵠立雪中脫帽相送。重光在車中猶頻頻點首不已。</p>
<h3>記大雪中瑣聞</h3>
<p>孫·籌·成·</p>
<p>月之十三日夜半起。至十四日中午止。滬上六出紛飛。大如鵝掌。予性好遊。乘此遍巡外灘公園。并登東方飯店之屋頂。以賞雪。爰將所見情形。照錄如下。　　打掃軌道　是日晨起。積雪甚多。未經人踐。潔白可愛。電車軌道。均被雪蔽。司機者恐難遵循。或欲出軌。故公司内清晨加派小工。分頭打掃軌道。予六時佇立久安里口。見正豐街上共有小工十餘人。手持鐵剷。將雪剷除。復以掃帚依軌打掃。分班工作。於冰天雪地中。毫不畏縮。殊佩勞工神聖。</p>
<p>銅象肥胖　七時許至外灘遙望浦東。瓦屋皆白。俯視浦東。船爲雪蔽。瓊樓玉宇。頓成白銀世界。有四五西童。追逐於公園門口。短衣革履。精神充足。回顧浦畔所立銅象。積雪數寸。宛似石髙所爲。較平素肥胖多矣。惜未携帶攝影機。否則此種雪景。爲滬上不可多得。應攝入鏡頭。以留紀念。</p>
<p>爭避汽車　十時後。行人漸多。馬路上所積之雪。經人踐蹈。變爲泥漿。汽車車輪。被没數寸。行駛時將泥漿激動。水花四濺。煞是好看。但兩旁人行道上之行人。苟被波及。莫不衣汚遍體。故咸爭先恐後而趨避。間有因逃避不及而反傾跌者。大呼觸霉頭不已。</p>
<p>無地自容　西藏路上有一妙齡女郎。乘人力車由北而面。車夫偶一不愼。失足車覆。致將女郎跌入雪内。满身泥漿。屢起屢仆。蓋高跟皮鞋。遇滑即倒。車夫知已闖禍。拖車而遁。旋經西裝少年扶之使起。行人莫不注目。致女郎面呈赤化。無地自容。</p>
<h3>英集郵家奪得錦標記</h3>
<p>嵇·覲·</p>
<p>歐西人士。往往搜集古郵票以爲玩品。方寸之紙。動逾萬金。年愈遠而見珍。物以稀而爲貴。此中價値。漫無定制。亦各投人之所好而已。近據柏林通訊云。本月上旬。此間舉行萬國郵票展覽會。首獎金牌。竟爲英人西慕氏所得。查西氏所有之郵票。不下百餘種。要惟以基阿那於一七二六年至一七四八年發行之一仙郵票爲最著名。其色淡黃。上　　薇花邊。中間空白處。繪有聖安特神像。精細無比。若以數百倍之顯微鏡測之。鬚眉畢現。均係凸起。額端有指爪痕。眞贋之辨。即在此點。計每枚現値英金一萬五千元。西氏所藏。亦僅二三枚而已。此外如蘇格蘭之金鷹郵票。以及坎拿大之整棻郵票。雖屬罕見。然以基阿那較之。不僅年代相差。抑且價値各異。一經品題。宜乎錦標之獨得也。在未開會以前。曾有人願倍其値以覓之者。門庭若市。概弗之見。其妻勸以求虚榮不如沾實惠等語。彼竟負氣出門。匿居倫敦三月。迨至開會。始敢露其色相。然亦奇矣。</p>
<h3>閘北瑣記</h3>
<p>秀</p>
<p>邇來各馬路上。不論晴雨日夕。常有日本僧人二三。服灰布袈裟。厥式宛似吾國僧侶。衆口呢喃。擊鼓鼕鼕然。卑躬捷步面過。絕不類募化之流。見者僉莫名其妙。是亦足資研究者也。</p>
<p>三段救火會義務主任一席。自劉榮泰捐軀後。公推陳紹基君承其乏。陳爲一胖子。膂力絕人。聞某處之役。嘗於火塲中爲殃及之鄰家。挾重數百斤之鐵保險箱。從樓上緣梯疾降而下。其孔武有力如是。亦足多矣。（却酬）</p>
<h3>巴黎物語</h3>
<p>（二）（一）（一）六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>拿戈瓦弟言其爲錫蘭島人。非印度人。錫蘭與印度分立。彼處中國人甚少。只數家而已。古稱獅子國。爲小乘佛敎所興之地。有盤古塚亞當橋。云古時亞當夏娃居此。後被上帝逐出。經過此橋云。然則　園古跡在錫蘭乎。人種始出於此乎。以問拿戈。拿戈亦不敢斷言其家爲人祖所出。惟曰今尙有野象極多。奇異植物不少。錫蘭要可爲世界研究動植學者之公園矣。君若經印度南角遊歐。可到錫蘭一遊。道階法師言。錫蘭佛像五彩者甚美。又尼泊爾玉石佛像尤美。過於緬甸。若在錫蘭買整套各佛像。須二百元。若從緬甸到印度遊佛蹟。亦須一二百元可遍遊。因印度生活低於仰光也。但遊佛跡不可於雨季去。因交通不便故也。</p>
<p>六號。周光贊君約赴美以美會遊藝會。晚六時後舉行。乃爲　建人而設。是以知外人傳敎之深心。彼對於吾國各部分。均専門分類負責進行也。其表演者。第一爲吹蛋戲。畫一格於地。令成人或兒童以口伏地吹蛋前滾。先滾到其圈綫者。爲第一。願者伏地待吹。　男伏於地上。一女司口號。余默念此等戲法。只宜於　笨之雄性。若女性文雅。决不肯爲之。此可證從游戲上判斷兩性工作之大異也。第二作一　力戯。衆男鑽圈。結果奮力互衝。一羣亂閧大笑爲樂。余用性的分析。又只合於雄性之動作。結果有一種游戲男女合作。乃用點名送信。法排兩行。一行男。一行女。使男女互換位置。務於忙中使兩性有一接觸之機會。　此可見凡兩性協同動作之團體。雌性即調和而不亂動矣。若純雄性。必大打一番乃己。此例可普遍觀察雄性一切遊戯也。</p>
<p>七號。泰平會成。印人亦加入。并以詩作頌詞。</p>
<p>八號。荷屬邱君來談。述其自身作敎員以至爲商發財後乃有種運動之經騐。雖有財產公諸於人。亦無能改造社會也。彼曾以萬元與數人共同勞動。試騐共產學說。結果人乃誣賴非其產。由此可知人性上難以共產也。余念託而士太曾言之。人類非但與以財。即可得救者。唯物惟心兩面均有關係也。邱君自己散財力任勞工以試騐所得。可謂切實之報告也。但余深察西洋學說之鍺誤。在盧梭以感情倡平等。即事實上人之度量相越。乃相差遠甚。故馬克司力求其平等之實現。結論自非一切公共不可。十九世紀之馬克司。一如十八世紀之　梭也。然結果上社會問題仍難解决。蓋智者過之。愚者不及。中　之道爲難能耳。東方大同公平之道。固勝於平等乎。</p>

<h3>洋釐突漲二釐許</h3>
<p>昨日爲結賬期之大總日、市氣亦以手續紛繁、而致特變洋厘午市飛越、計早市爲七錢二分二厘半、午市忽漲二厘半、而爲七錢二分五厘、甚至中途掛牌到過七八厘、銀拆亦有五分行市、早午相　、做出洋欵交易、匯劃票欵、早市一百六十七萬五千、午市一百二十萬、鈔票早市一萬、午市六萬五千　、塲外鈔票早市十三萬、午市十六萬五千、銀行交易、因係大結束期、故雖星期、亦照常營業、昨日早市互市六十萬、午市五十五萬、收解無從懸揣、從略、小錢莊做開輔幣市况、江南小洋早市爲六錢七分二厘、午市爲六錢八分三厘、做出交易早市三千角、午市一萬三千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢七分四厘、午早爲六錢七分三厘、做出交易、早市二十三萬五千角、午市十七萬角、銅元三百四十文、與前日相同、</p>
<h3>銀錢業昨日大結束情形</h3>
<p>昨日習俗个沿之廢歷小除夕、而今日又爲大除夕對於十九年度各種賬略、完全須告歸束、故情形異常忙亂、但查銀錢業之放欵往來賬之成績、什九以昨日作總結束、而銀行昨日適値星期、本擬照例封關、因係總結束期故特别破例、除外商銀行仍封關外、所有華商各銀行、無論中國·交通·中央等一槪照常勞業、但外商銀行之中國賬房（即俗稱買辦間）亦照常受理收解、至於各種收解欵項、無論何項、槪行歸結、以致洋戶往來大軋空頭、洋厘價飛騰、職是之故、惟錢莊今日、（十六日）本擬休業、因受銀行要求、乃特别通融、照常辦公云、</p>
<h3>紗花上週紗市高漲</h3>
<p>多方聲勢雄偉</p>
<p>未來變化尙大</p>
<p>紗市在週初頗有扶搖直上之勢、實以匯兌難鬆、海外花紗狀况有轉機之望、外棉以受匯市打擊、採算銀盤合價大貴、於是本棉漲風劇烈、唇齒相關之紗市、難以趨跌、買方態度强硬、賣方知潮帮中堅份子失敗以後、散戶敵力甚衰、故塲中多頭聲勢尤壯、星期一前市四盤中、激漲四兩外、空方一時追解證全不及、雙方相持不下、經紀人召集緊急會議、議决所中對谥新買進增收特别證金每件二十兩、以後有一部維持賣出、形勢略見和緩週末因所中休假數日、金價又漲、散空抵補、漲風愈覺銳利、但實銷益覺岭寂、毫無生氣、因臘尾結賬關係、查全週各客帮買去統計一千七百二十五包、同行中進六百六十五包、行情漲四·五·兩不等、標紗週末有一部份廠商套出然漲勢仍烈、總之原料高貴、明春開出、深恐有激烈之變化發現也、全週成交統十四萬七千一百五十包、標紗各月價比前週近月漲六兩以外、遠漲四兩外、茲將各帮買去現紗之量額、</p>

<h3>上週棉市大漲特漲</h3>
<p>匯兌不鬆外棉難合</p>
<p>日商狂吸附和者多</p>
<p>棉市在上週間漲風之劇烈、爲歷來所罕見、頗似棉荒時代之恐慌、此種景象、完全受匯兌打擊、金價難小、致外棉採算銀盤不通、而日商在期貨市塲中大批吸收、播放空氣、一般附和者亦屬不少、空方自潮帮失敗之後、敵力甚弱、而滬埠底貨單薄、人心良好、新抛者絕跡、視於風勢緊急皆不敢妄動也、故市價繼長增高、標花各月價比前週漲二·三·兩不等、成交全週計三十七萬六千四百擔、碼頭上來源計姚花一千一百三十包、通花一千八百包、廠商買進一萬五千六百四十擔、洋行進二千擔、美棉漲五十磅音、茲將各廠商及洋行買去之額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>美棉回軟英印上漲</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因同業買進而堅　後因天雨及多頭了結、市况回軟、計限貨跌三至八磅音、現貨跌五磅音、英棉期貨漲二三點、現貨漲八點、埃及棉現貨漲十五點、印棉因歐洲出口商及經紀商購進、市况堅昂、計平果爾近遠期漲六羅比、奧姆辣漲六羅比、遠期漲五羅比、白羅溪漲七羅比、遠期漲六羅比、原奄錄左、（十四日電）</p>

<h3>上週美棉斷續上漲</h3>
<p>紐约十三日來電報告一週中之原棉云、上週棉市以營業漸見起色、及棉田减少之故而續漲、歐洲人心較佳、故外商買進、國内購買及空頭抵補亦同時並起、而投機需要亦形增光也、證券之較堅、足證事業有起色之望、少數之現貨供給以及三月期之多頭了結、均被吸收、惟五月期價達一角一分以上時、則需要轉淡、誠恐價格過高、或將影響於實際地位及减種問題也、中央棉帶已獲甘霖、惟尙覺未足、播種佈置進行甚佳云附週末統計如左（單位千包）</p>

<h3>印棉價格問題的研究</h3>
<p>印棉纖維比較美棉爲短、品質亦較低、此爲一般人所共認者、雖印棉不能與美棉相直接競爭但有不可忘懷者、美印棉閒價格之差額、如距某種規定之限度高低相差過甚時、則消費將彼此轉移、此乃觀於日本印棉消費及較少的美國内印棉消費、尤可顯見者也、以廣義言、印棉市價隨美棉價格而起落、然就一部份言、謂印棉受不可計算的國仙消費及外來的銀價關係之影響、甚於美棉、亦無不可、預料印棉價格之資料、可分析之而得表如左、</p>

<p>棉季中之預測的平均價格、將隨金價之變遷或各種批發價格標準之變遷而改正之、印棉之準確推測、未必較美棉爲困難、惟因印度政府所採用發表棉產報告之方法、須在棉季過去後始可得總供給之統計、例如一九三○丨三一年印度棉產之第一預測表示棉田一四、八七五、○○○英畝者、並不言及可使估計最後產量之一中棉地、但不過發表其在某時所接到之報告耳、此種辦法殊不美满、因此欲得關於棉之正確細則、乃决不能事、茲姑取輸出廠銷手紡消費等而研究、列表如下、</p>

<p>自蘭開夏棉花公司成立後、印棉消費比較他棉大爲增多、而美棉與埃及棉在印棉上之價格差額、亦有相當之减落、一九二八丨二九年美棉每磅平均價比印度高美金四分、但現已减至美金二分矣、（農）</p>
<h3>煤炭煤球銷路獨暢</h3>
<p>近兩日來、本埠各煤店家之門市生意、熱閙異常尤以煤球去路爲最廣、每日總共售出、約在千噸左右、白煤去胃流暢售價亦極堅挺、柳江白煤、每噸竟售至二十八元、惟下身貨如紅崎小子、馬克小子等、走勢極呆、蓋近日本埠各翻砂作銅作等、均有停工之故、烟煤各貨、本埠如西人住宅飯店等亦有大批買進、是以各店家之棧司出車、頗形忙碌云、</p>

<h3>台尾爾逹甫逝世二百年紀念</h3>
<p>「魯濱生飄流記」的原著者台尾爾達甫、他的名字很是普遍、凡是讀過這部書的人、差不多都曉得達甫這個名字、今年恰値他逝世二百週年、全球各地都爲他做週年紀念、那個盛况實在是很少見的、達甫人家都稱他爲「現代小說之父、」是一個倫敦人、生於十七世紀末葉、伊的父親名呌及姆士甫、在克立伯爾開脫的聖加爾士地方充當屠夫、他後來把名字改掉、那時他兒子還没有到中年時期哩、</p>
<p>起初、小台尼爾想做一個異敎的牧師、他在學校裏也很上進、但是他終久改變了他的志向、所以離了學校之後、就從事商業、在一個襪子店裏做過一兩年、後來他酷嗜文字、做了一首詩、大爲威廉王所激賞、命他入覲之外、還賜了不少金錢、可是安妮王后即位之後、他因爲寫了一本關於異敎的小册子竉眷大不如前、這一本書爲異敎徒和國敎徒大家所不歡喜、下議院因此很嚴重的下令、將所有的書燒燬、並且懸賞了五十金鎊通緝達甫、　　復有多久、達甫果然被拘了、除了罰欵之外還受枷刑、不過他的刑罰却變成了他的榮耀、因爲民衆對於他有非常的好感、將鮮花裝飾在枷木上、成了大家崇拜的英雄、然而達甫視自己已經是第二次的破產了、他一算之下、爲了這椿官司、損失了三千五百鎊、所以在新城獄中時、達甫發行一種星期評論、攻擊政府、後來他出獄之後、政府却給他一個職位、</p>
<p>他被派往蘇格蘭、鼓吹蘇英國會聯盟、但是他爲了政治活動、又遭累下獄、一七一九年達甫出版「魯濱生克洛沙」第一卷、成亦了寫小說的藝術、起初、讀他著作的人、都以爲書裏面講的都是眞實的事、實則大半是意想、雖然有許多材料取之於一個水手、名呌亞力山大歇爾克、他是曾遭沉船之難的、達甫因爲「魯濱生克洛沙」一書、受到許多榮譽、便把自己的感想又寫了兩本書、但是没有一本書出名、</p>
<h3>十九年的上海新畫展</h3>
<p>當全國美術展覽會、於十八年春天、在上海的國貨路上、曾　哄動了不少學藝術底人們、而也是事實上的需要、並不是作點輟品的盛大底畫展、但是直到十九年的十二月、却不見有第二次的再現、實在是中國美術界的不振氣象、雖然祇有三十年的歷史的中國新畫界、可是總不免被人譏爲無特殊的　至少在水面綫上的進步、當然新畫界之所以不振的原因是多方面的像敎育的虚僞、作家的淺薄和留學生的賣野人頭及其他種種原因、同時學者也是往往走入歧途、因之造成今日之新畫界的沉悶、事實上却是如此、我們又無從掩飾的、</p>
<p>這年頭兒的畫展還總算閙熱、我所參觀過的一共有十八次、那末一均起來每月也有一次半、反過來說二個月裏總有三次的新畫展呢、我不能詳細地叙述每個展覽會的各方面、只記出他的日期和地點、從下列的表裏可以看見去年的上海新畫界一段的現狀、</p>

<h3>關於白鵝畫展的話</h3>
<p>樓·金·　·</p>
<p>白鵝第五屆習作展覽會、從一月三十一日開幕、（三十一日）我在三十一日的早上、把全部的作口都看過了、所留的印象及感想、現在寫在下面、</p>
<p>潘思同氏有一幀「荒城之午」、畫過野外寫生的人、我想當他對着中國古舊的城垣時候、瑄是很躊躇地想着、丨怎樣才能畫出一個最適當最美的樣子出來、因爲這古舊的城垣、太龐大、少變化、是很難措手的、但是這一幅「荒城之午」郤是例外、對於作者處置畫材能夠有這樣一個結果、非常使人心折、「荒城之午」所給予觀者的那個受着落日黃色强光籠圍着的古舊的城垣、使我們感到那些畫紅色洋樓以及游艇的作者們作品的可厭、似乎覺得這古舊的灰色的城垣與我們異常合式、親切容許我們不少的瞑想與懷念啊、</p>
<p>陳秋草氏之「孤燈」與「長春路之夏」、他用着一種特異的筆觸、給我們一個爽利的美的、迷濛的感覺、</p>
<p>再次方雪鳱氏之「裸女一」是一幀很大的作品、完成這樣大幅畫是很不易的、使人感服、都雷鷗氏之「畫劉彤霞」用着朱標紅畫的紅色女服的女子像、棄去了近來一般作風方面淺簿味道的意味、暴露着创有純熟技巧后面的、</p>
<p>從中國現有的藝術團體盾、白鵝似乎是在跑向一個不同的方向的、同樣有着他們的缺憾與長處、我覺得他們的好處、在於對着畫布的時候、照着自己的意思去變易對象、使對象符合自己認爲美的條件的一面、因此他們的畫面上、是筆觸很統一、清潔、色調是很調和的、對於一件、物人、都把他們解决得很清晣、没有一些零亂模湖的地方、總之使觀者有一個單純的清明的感覺、這是他們的長處、但是有時便因此太離去了對象、欠缺了對象所給予人類千變萬化的色與輪廓、這是極不幸、這是我的一點意見、大槪白鵝同人諸君不至於見怪的罷、</p>

<h3>Jin Province New Provincial Committee, Shang Zhen, etc. Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Miao Peicheng Presided Over the Oath</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Shang Zhen and Committee Members Chang Bingyi, Guo Baoqing, and Zhang Weiqing held an oath-taking ceremony at the Provincial Government Auditorium on the 15th. Miao Peicheng presided over the oath. More than two hundred representatives from various groups and agencies, as well as provincial government officials, attended. The ceremony was quite grand. Shang Zhen and the committee members took the oath together. Miao delivered an address, and Shang Zhen responded on behalf of the committee members, saying that they were determined to abide by the teachings of the late Premier and the laws of the Party and the country, and sincerely accept the addresses from the supervisory committee and representatives. They were determined to eradicate long-standing abuses and strive to create a new Shanxi. As for specific measures, they would be announced after consultations and comprehensive planning with the committee members. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 am after a photograph. Miao Peicheng took the noon train to Ping, returning to Beijing. Shang and others saw him off. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Shanxi Association of Fellow Villagers in Beijing sent a telegram to Qiu Zengyi, Li Shangren, and Feng Sizhi, advising them not to take office. Li and Feng are currently in the province.</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Shang Zhen, Xu, Fu, and Yang hosted a banquet for various generals, provincial committee members, and Ji Chen, etc., at the Shanxi Grand Hotel on the evening of the 15th for a celebratory gathering.</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Shang Zhen telegraphed the Central Government, requesting them to send an oath supervisor to Taiyuan to preside over the oath. Before the arrival of the supervisor, they planned to take office first and reschedule the oath ceremony. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The newly appointed Director of the Department of Agriculture and Industry, Chang Bingyi, said that the new Director of Finance, Zhang Jixin, originally planned to come with him, but had to stop due to illness. The provincial government would wait for Qiu Zengyi to return, and then the new committee members would take office. Based on past experience, he deeply knew that developing industry through government management was not as good as through commercial management, and that the most detrimental to the country and the people was Sino-foreign joint ventures. In the future, Shanxi's mining and other industries would adopt a commercial management system, with the government providing legal protection to encourage popular investment. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed Ping, stating that the provincial government committee would take office today. Regarding the methods of downsizing and reorganization, the Central Government had already approved them. The railway protection and garrison troops would all be downsized. All generals were to follow the plan. The local area was peaceful. The 1.7 million taels planned to be raised from the Northeast had not yet been remitted to Shanxi, so Shanxi would first raise 800,000 taels. On the 14th, the army division commanders discussed further methods of eliminating the old and weak, and the steps had been determined. The demobilization would be completed in two months. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Generals Decide to Complete Demobilization Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>Division Commanders to Return to Their Posts Within Days</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The division commanders decided to return to their defense areas in a day or two. Shang Zhen and Xu had ordered the Department of Finance to allocate funds to pay the arrears of the various armies. The post-war affairs of the various armies were to be handled by a military commission composed of the five army commanders. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The generals of the headquarters decided on the 14th that the division commanders would return to their defense areas starting from the 15th, implement demobilization in accordance with the Tianjin agreement's demobilization methods, and complete the demobilization before the 25th. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) At the headquarters meeting on the 13th, in addition to discussing the implementation of demobilization methods, the issue of the military commission and the abolition of the old headquarters was also discussed. The army commanders believed that the Shanxi military affairs agency had a considerable history, and for the sake of convenience and saving expenses, the headquarters should be closed down, and the five army commanders should form a new military commission. It was unnecessary to separately organize the various army headquarters. Shang, Xu, Yang, Fu, and Sun were nominated to be responsible for planning, and it was decided to merge the army headquarters and the military commission. On the one hand, they would urge Zhang to quickly transport the demobilization funds, and on the other hand, they would raise funds in Shanxi as a priority. The various departments would simultaneously demobilize on the spot in a uniform manner. On the 14th, the results were reported at a headquarters meeting. After the meeting, the army commanders returned to their defense areas to implement the plan. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) At the meeting on the 13th, some advocated that the headquarters be closed by the end of February, and that the salaries of the staff of the various departments be suspended starting in March. A military post-war closing office would be temporarily established, but after much discussion, no decision was made. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Regarding the supply of troops stationed in various counties, the headquarters and representatives of the various counties stipulated that the counties that had made advances before December of last year would be reimbursed by the headquarters. The various armies and departments were ordered to issue payments for December immediately, and payments for January and February would be issued after the counties reported the actual amounts. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Post-War Issues in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi to Visit Shanxi for Inspection</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the post-war issues in Shanxi Province, Shang Zhen's representative Nan Guishu, the Shanxi army's representative Wen Shouquan, and the Shanxi Post-War Advancement Association's representative Zhang Ce had successively arrived in Beijing. Each of them, from their respective representative standpoints, presented their subjective intentions to the Central Government. Nan and Wen had completed their tasks and returned to Shanxi, while Zhang remained in Beijing, representing the anti-Shang faction in carrying out all activities. Recently, the propaganda atmosphere had been very strong. The main reason for Zhang's presentation to the National Government was that he did not want a "substitute for Yan" to be active on the political stage. Regarding post-war matters, such as plans to downsize the troops into national defense forces, reorganize Shanxi currency, and reorganize the ordnance factories, he had attached recommendations. The government had already approved and forwarded the plans to the Executive Yuan for consideration. The Central Government, considering the complex internal situation in Shanxi Province, had to take into account the anti-Shang movement of the Shanxi people and the post-war arrangements, in order to eliminate the divisions between the North and the South. Kong Xiangxi's trip to Shanxi was scheduled to depart in about a week. Although his mission was to inspect party affairs, he was also charged with the important mission of fundamentally settling military and political issues. According to Zhang Ce, the Shanxi people had great trust and hope in the Central Government. He would meet with Chairman Jiang in person within days to report in detail. He would not leave Beijing until the Central Government had made a concrete statement. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Wen Shouquan arrived in Shenyang on the morning of the first day of the new year and spoke about the military and financial affairs of Shanxi Province, hoping that the authorities would seek a permanent solution to the post-war problems in Shanxi. Chief Secretary Wang Shuhan invited Wen to speak at noon. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan to be Established Today</h3>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member Selection No Longer to be Supplemented</p>
<p>Yuan Organizational Law Still Awaiting Revision</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan is scheduled to be formally established on the 16th. Among the new supervisory committee members in Beijing, only eight are present. The Yuan has telegraphed the supervisory committee members scattered in various places, instructing them to arrive in Beijing by the 22nd to take the oath of office simultaneously. The Design Committee of the Control Yuan was abolished on the 15th. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is said that Ru Yuli has been internally designated as the President of the Audit Yuan, and Wang Kaijiang will be appointed as the Vice President of the Yuan. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan is scheduled to be formally established on the 16th, and the supervisory committee members will take office on the 23rd. Among the supervisory committee members in Beijing are Liu San, Xie Wuliang, Zhou Lisheng, Wu Zhongxin, Zheng Biaosheng, Shao Hongji, etc. Yu Youren has repeatedly telegraphed urging the committee members inside and outside Beijing to come to Beijing. The National Government Organization Law stipulates that there should be 19 to 29 supervisory committee members, but it is not necessary to have 29 members. Yu Youren believes that it is difficult to find suitable candidates, and that 23 people are sufficient to start work. The Central Political Committee will not submit a supplementary list on Wednesday. The Audit Yuan has been ordered to close and be reorganized into a ministry. The selection of the minister will be proposed after the establishment of the Control Committee and the allocation of work. The draft laws on the Punishment of Officials, the Rules of Procedure for the Control Committee Meetings, and the Regulations for Reviewing Cases have all been drafted by the Design Committee of the Yuan and will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan or the Central Control Committee for revision and implementation. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the preparation period of the Control Yuan, more than 30 cases of direct accusations by the people against officials have not been processed. The Secretariat is currently sorting them out. According to information from the Control Yuan, the supervisory powers of various countries are divided into two parts: impeachment and trial. When a supervisory committee member or a citizen accuses an official of suspected illegal or criminal conduct in their duties, the official must be tried after investigation and impeachment. According to the Control Yuan Organization Law, there are no trial regulations. It can only transfer the illegal officials to the Judges Disciplinary Committee of the Judicial Yuan for handling, which is a rather cumbersome procedure. Yu Youren plans to submit the Organization Law to the government for revision. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Guofu telegraphed Beijing, stating that he had recovered from his illness and would probably come to Beijing for a trip this week. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The capital's military police authorities recently received a report that the Japanese ship "Wuling Maru," which departed from Shanghai the day before, was carrying a batch of contraband. They immediately notified the Japanese consulate and requested them to send personnel to jointly inspect the ship. The Japanese consulate telegraphed Chongguang for instructions and then received Chongguang's reply agreeing to the inspection. Chongguang also telegraphed the "Wuling Maru," which was en route, instructing it to stop in Nanjing. At 7:00 a.m. on the 15th, the "Wuling Maru" arrived at Xiaguan and docked at the Osaka Wharf. Inspectors from the Jinling Customs and the capital garrison headquarters, as well as representatives from the Japanese consulate, boarded the ship to search the cargo. When they searched the cargo hold, they found twelve large boxes that were very suspicious and immediately detained them all. Laborers transported them to the customs for inspection and informed the captain that he was not allowed to set sail without an order from the customs. After the suspicious large boxes were transported to the customs, inspectors from the three parties jointly inspected them. The first box contained shrimp powder, and the second box contained sea dragons, with several submachine guns buried inside. The submachine guns were removed, and the remaining boxes were inspected. As a result, thirty submachine guns were found. It was reported that the sender was the Shanghai Hengtai News Agency, and the recipient was Yichang. Customs clearance procedures had been completed at the Jianghai Customs. The garrison headquarters and customs were currently discussing how to handle the contraband. The "Wuling Maru" received a release order from the customs at 7:00 p.m. that evening and set sail at 7:30 p.m., having been detained for about twelve hours. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Spanish Coup</h3>
<p>The opportunity for coups has always been subtle. The mutual attacks and criticisms of political parties and the repeated disputes in parliament sometimes create a very serious situation. However, none of these are sufficient to be regarded as a crisis that shakes the foundation of the country. Only the opinions expressed by the majority of the people, invisibly, are related to the direction of the people's hearts. At first glance, it seems that there is not much power, but over time, it becomes the strongest thing in the world. A powerful government, either suddenly disregarding it or restricting it with extremely severe means, believes that no one would dare to resist. Once there is a gap to take advantage of, its downfall is as easy as destroying dry weeds. When Berenguer took office in Spain, although he wanted to appease the people, he declared that he would never act like the previous dictatorial cabinet of Rivera. However, the policies he implemented afterwards were still as dictatorial as the previous cabinet and still only obeyed the orders of the King of Spain. The crisis had already been hidden. Therefore, the people's republican movement soon arose, and the call to oppose the monarchy became louder and louder. Revolutionary and strike waves rose and fell continuously. General Berenguer, relying on the power of his troops and the help of the royalists, tried his best to suppress the people's reaction, but it was not only ineffective but also accelerated the formation of new factions. Now, Berenguer's cabinet has been forced to resign. The proposal to convene a voters' meeting will be realized. The calls for the King to abdicate are also growing. The end of the Spanish monarchy and the beginning of republican politics may be determined by this coup. It is not impossible.</p>
<p>Although the resignation of Berenguer's cabinet and the republican movement have been victorious, more attention should be paid to future actions. Dr. Zamora, the former head of the Liberal Party, said that the King must abdicate, but the actions of the Republican Party should avoid causing internal strife and accidental disputes due to other reasons. This statement is crucial. If the Republican Party of today suddenly does not pay attention, then the future of Spain will still not be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Major Developments in Spanish Political Situation</h3>
<p>Bérenguer Cabinet Resigns</p>
<p>Order for General Election Cancelled</p>
<p>King Said to Agree to Convene a Constituent Assembly</p>
<p>Reuter's, Madrid, Spain, 14th - The cabinet has resigned.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Madrid, Spain, 14th - The public is paying close attention to all current political developments in Spain. Today, crowds gathered outside the palace, watching the comings and goings of leaders of various political parties. Public opinion generally believes that the nation's future will soon change. Rumors were rife yesterday, saying that the King had yielded to public demands and agreed to convene a constituent assembly to discuss constitutional issues and possibly request the King's abdication. These rumors have taken clearer shape today. The leader of the reformists, Mr. Alcala Zamora, publicly stated after meeting with the King that he had declared to the King that the only way to resolve the situation was to convene a constituent assembly whose sovereignty was higher than the King's.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Madrid, Spain, 15th - Before resigning, the Bérenguer government submitted an order to the King to cancel the general election scheduled for March 15th, which has now been signed by the King. The cabinet resigned yesterday because the leader of the Liberal Party informed the Prime Minister that after the new parliament was elected, he would request the convening of a constituent assembly. The King has now summoned various political leaders to meet again at the palace today.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 10th - After the cabinet's resignation, it is widely believed that the Spanish King will order Admiral Aznar, the Commander of the Navy, to form a cabinet, giving important positions to the Liberal and Constitutional Parties. However, this cabinet is transitional in nature, and its main difficult task is to prepare for the convening of a constitutional assembly to draft a new constitution. Many in political circles expect that Mr. Aznar will not be willing to take on this arduous task. If so, the Spanish King will find it extremely difficult to find a suitable person, as the major politicians see that the monarchist cause has suffered another major setback and is at its last gasp, so they are unwilling to risk everything for it. After the news of the cabinet's resignation spread, the public was overjoyed. Thousands of people gathered in front of newspaper offices, waiting for the results of the King's meeting with the Prime Minister. When a special edition was published announcing the cabinet's decision to resign, crowds embraced and kissed each other. Similar demonstrations took place simultaneously throughout the country, with crowds shouting "Down with the King" and singing republican battle songs until they were dispersed by the militia. The authorities have now ordered soldiers in various camps to be ready for deployment at any time, and have increased police patrols on the streets.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 14th - Following the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Bérenguer, public sentiment has been greatly shaken, and republicans are excited and delighted. Mr. Bérenguer's resignation was mainly due to the growing strength of the republican movement, realizing that it could no longer be suppressed by force and would erupt sooner or later. The situation in major industrial areas is particularly precarious. When the Liberal Party leaders Count Romanones and Mr. Prieto stated a few days ago that the party was prepared to reconsider its attitude towards the general election and would demand the dissolution of parliament even if it participated, and would immediately demand dissolution once parliament was convened, so that a constitutional conference could be held to draft a new constitution, Mr. Bérenguer, with the situation deteriorating daily and the original plan being of no avail, had no choice but to devise new measures or perhaps save the situation. Therefore, he decided to step aside and make way for more capable individuals. Now, rumors are spreading in the capital, some saying that the King will abdicate in favor of his brother-in-law, Prince Bourbon, the Cavalry Commander, and others saying that the King wants to order the current Navy Commander to form a cabinet. In short, the changing situation has reached an unpredictable state, and no one dares to predict what will happen.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Sends Letter to Viceroy Requesting Meeting and Dialogue</h3>
<p>All-India Congress Work Suspended</p>
<p>Reuter's, Allahabad, 14th - At the request of Indian representatives to the Indian Round Table Conference, such as Mr. Sapru, Gandhi has sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin, advocating for a meeting and dialogue on equal terms. According to Gandhi, Viceroy Irwin is better able than the representatives attending the Round Table Conference to dispel doubts and misunderstandings about the resolutions of the Round Table Conference. The Working Committee of the National Congress has now temporarily suspended its meetings.</p>
<h3>Issue of Japanese Naval Ratio to the US</h3>
<p>Uchida Challenges Prime Minister</p>
<p>Demands Retraction of False Statement</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 15th - According to the statement of Navy Minister Abo at the Budget Committee, the ratio of 10,000-ton cruisers to the US is 67.7%, but Prime Minister Hamaguchi stated in his reply at the previous Diet that the ratio to the US was 72.2%, which is entirely fabricated. Yesterday, at the first subcommittee meeting of the budget committee, Mr. Uchida of the Seiyukai Party severely questioned Prime Minister Hamaguchi's false statement, and urged Vice Prime Minister Kijura to force Prime Minister Hamaguchi to retract his previous statement. Mr. Kijura replied that he hoped to dispel public misunderstandings in the coming days. Mr. Uchida further attacked, saying that Mr. Shidehara made a speech at the Asahi Auditorium of Hosei University, saying that the ratio of large cruisers to the US was 72.2%, with smugness and extreme frivolity. To a man who acted in this manner, recommending the granting of favorable imperial words, Prime Minister Hamaguchi was derelict in his duty. The attack was very fierce. Vice Prime Minister Kijura replied that he would investigate the facts before dealing with it. However, the Seiyukai Party attaches great importance to this issue and will thoroughly investigate the government's responsibility.</p>
<h3>Important Amendments to Japanese Civil Code</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Northeast China-Japan Railway Negotiations</h3>
<p>National Diplomacy Association Sends Representatives to Visit Zhang</p>
<p>Presents Methods to Deal with Japanese Demands</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch - The Liaoning National Diplomacy Association, because Japan recently sent Kimura, a director of the South Manchurian Railway, to Shenyang to negotiate railway issues, which are of great importance to national sovereignty, specially selected Wang Huayi, chairman of the Provincial Education Association, Jin Enqi, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, and others as representatives the other day, and held a petition to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang at 6 pm. After Mr. Zhang personally received them, the representatives expressed their sincere opinions to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang deeply commended the association for this action and said that his personal patriotism would never lag behind. He would definitely rely on public opinion regarding the railway negotiation issue and was currently preparing countermeasures. If mass organizations could exhaust their wisdom and offer suggestions to the government, he would try his best to accommodate them. The cordial conversation lasted about half an hour, and the representatives retired satisfied. The petition of the Foreign Association is recorded below: (We believe that since Japan adopted an aggressive policy towards China, it has sought to devote all its efforts to colonizing Manchuria and Mongolia, and its focus is on railway policy. Now, the various railways in our Northeast are taking the form of connections and giving a major blow to the South Manchurian Railway. Its ambition will inevitably be further stimulated. Kimura, a director of the South Manchurian Railway, came to Shenyang from Dalian a few days ago with an important mission to conduct railway negotiations. It can be definitely concluded that this is not conducive to our country. According to the Japanese newspaper, Japan has put forward four conditions to us: (1) Non-recognition of the Chinese construction of the Datan Road and the Jinzhao Road; (2) Expedite the construction of the Jihui Line; (3) Revision of the loan contract for the Taoang-Jidun Line; (4) China and Japan negotiate freight rates on railways. Looking at the above four items, one, three, and four are all attached conditions, and the most important thing is the construction of the Jihui Road in the second item. If the Jihui Road is completed, Japan will be able to control the transportation of northern Manchuria and develop the rich resources of northern Manchuria, which will be of great military convenience. In any case, it is absolutely difficult to approve. Our Deputy Commander should be able to fully weigh the pros and cons and strictly refuse. What the people demand: (1) Disclose the details of the negotiation of this case to the people; (2) If necessary, transfer it to the central government for handling; (3) Maintain our interests and prevent Japan from achieving its ambitions and protect our sovereignty. We respectfully present our humble opinions to you, and recommend Wang Huayi, Jin Enqi, Lu Guangji, and Su Shangda as representatives to present and explain everything in person. We hope you will observe. (10th)</p>
<h3>Two More Cases in the Harbin Legal Community</h3>
<p>Judicial Police Rob Gold Store in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Clerk Robs Property on the Road After Dusk</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch - At 2 pm on the 8th of this month, two bandits dressed in gray cloth cotton robes took a Soviet-driven small car to Hongxing Gold Store on Zhengyang Street in Daowai, pretending to buy gold medals. Taking advantage of the fact that there were no other customers in the store, they suddenly drew their guns, one standing at the door and the other holding a gun, threatening the shop assistants not to move. Because there were many shop assistants and the shop was very large, the two could not take care of everything, so several shop assistants escaped from the back door. At that time, the bandit fired a shot to intimidate, hitting the ceiling. At the same time, he jumped into the counter, wrapped more than a thousand dollars in banknotes in a handkerchief in a hurry, and went out to get into the car to escape. Unexpectedly, the Soviet driver glimpsed the situation in the room from the street window and knew that the two were bandits, so he slipped away to another place in advance. After the two bandits got into the car, they did not see the driver, so they jumped out of the car again and ran west along Zhengyang Street and then north to Toudao Street. At this time, many of Hongxing Gold Store's partners had chased them out, shouting "Bandits" behind them. The two bandits panicked, and the one holding the money abandoned it on the ground and ran to the Jiangyan Tongfa Street. One of them took advantage of the chaos of the crowd and squeezed into the crowd to escape. The bandit who fled to the Jiangyan ran to the riverside and saw that the area was sparsely populated and there was nowhere to hide, so he turned back and fled into a hutong. He happened to be glimpsed by Yang Yucheng, a sentry of the Binjiang Armed Security Team, who aimed and fired two shots from behind, one hitting the back of the heart and the other hitting the temple, killing him on the spot. After the bandit died, police officers arrived at the scene one after another and searched his body, and an unexpected event was discovered. In the dead bandit's arms was a gun permit from the Special District Local Procuratorate, and the name, age, and gun number were all clearly stated as Yang Guozhen. At that time, the police authorities felt that this secret was difficult to show to others, and they hurriedly ordered people to carry the corpse away and bury it, ordering the newspapers not to report the facts. However, the population is vast, and the city is already full of knowledge. The Special Court and the Daowai authorities negotiated a method to strictly investigate the facts. This was yesterday's event. A few days ago, in the evening, a public bus carried passengers from Daoli to Xiba Zashi. A Soviet woman was riding in the car, carrying a purse containing many gold notes and Harbin notes, which was glimpsed by a man sitting next to her. After getting off the bus at Xiba Taiwan City, the man followed the Soviet woman to a secluded place, robbed her of her purse and ran away. The Soviet woman was shocked and shouted loudly, which was heard by students from a nearby Soviet school, who chased after him and arrested the man. Afterwards, he confessed to the police that he was a clerk in the Special District Court, named Chen Luru. The police also did not handle it. The above two matters, together with the case of Ye Yixiong killing Zhang Wang Liqing, the female owner of Xie Xing Sauce Garden, have all been committed by people in the Special District Judicial community in less than three months. It is truly regrettable! (February 9th)</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Arrest of Communists in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Case Was Solved Due to Informants</p>
<p>Han and Zeng Are Important Members</p>
<p>Tianjin News - The Tianjin Public Security Bureau arrested a large number of Communists. It was found that the reason for the arrest of the Communists was due to an informant. During the years of the Republic of China 15 and 16, when the Kuomintang had not yet purged the party, a certain party member who worked with Han Linfu had been separated from Han for four years. Recently, he came to Tianjin. One day, while wandering around outside, he met Tian, a colleague from that time, who said that Han Linfu was now in Tianjin and would be leaving soon. Since they were old friends and had been through thick and thin together, why not meet Han for a talk? The person immediately agreed and agreed to meet Han at a teahouse in Quanye Market one evening. However, Han himself did not arrive at the appointed time and only sent a representative to meet and talk. During the conversation, the representative probed the person's attitude, and the person replied, "Now young people have no way out. As long as there is a good and righteous path to take, everyone will be happy to follow it." The representative thought that he was satisfied and returned to tell Han. Han then invited the person to meet at the Yuzhong Hotel. At that time, Han had changed his surname to Wang and immediately discussed in detail the Communist Party's plan to also transform into a miscellaneous army. Han also said that a certain army stationed in the Jin territory had been contacted and that all of them would be trained by him and that he would be the director of the political training department. After the person resigned, he believed that Han Linfu's attempt was related to the governance and chaos of the entire China and that after the army was rededicated, the people of the North would suffer more trampling and would not be able to survive. For the sake of the country's future, he had to stop it and informed Liu Butong of the City Consolidation Committee. Liu immediately inquired with the Public Security Bureau. Coincidentally, the Public Security Bureau had also received a similar report from the Special Agent Team, so they studied the arrest methods on the morning of the ninth. That night, Han Linfu and others had a dinner at the Yong'an Hotel in the French Concession, preparing to hold another conference soon and then leave Tianjin to work in the army. Unexpectedly, they were arrested late that night. When the detectives arrested Han, Han and his wife, Ms. Xiao Ying, were already in bed. After the person who led the way to the arrest pointed out Han's residence, he left. The detective then ordered the tea house to knock on the door and said, "Mr. Wang, there is a telegram for you." Han woke up from his sleep and opened the door, and the detective had already entered and hugged Han. At the same time, Han's wife was also arrested. Du Zhensheng was also arrested because he lived in the same Yuzhong Hotel and had contact with Han from time to time. The bank where Du's deposit is held is now being investigated to see if this stolen money can be withdrawn. After the search and arrest at the Yuzhong Hotel, the detectives went to the National Hotel. Because there were three Communist traffic team members living in the hotel, one of them was not there at the time, so only two people were arrested. Among the ten people arrested at No. 9 Qinrenli in the British Concession, one of them was Li Huisheng, who was an alias for Zeng Pilie. Zeng's wife, Li Rushui,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>, is the daughter of a certain tax bureau director, Mr. Li, in the city and is a sophomore at the Provincial No. 1 Girls' Middle School in Special Zone 1. She was also arrested at the same time. In addition, a car and various books were confiscated in the British Concession. In the Japanese Concession, Yu Lantian was arrested at No. 3 Taipingli, and Li Yushu, also known as Li Ruchang, was arrested at the Tianjin Hotel. The names of the other arrested people have not been announced because the investigation is still ongoing. It is reported that as a result of the interrogation the previous night, the Communists all confessed to being Communists and confessed their plans to participate in military work. Han Linfu is the chairman of the Communist Special Committee of the Three Special Zones of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Zeng Pilie is the chairman of the Communist Military Committee of the Northern Region. As of the evening, the Public Security Bureau is still continuing the interrogation. (12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Qingdao Become Overbearing</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Occupy Our Government Property for Several Years Without Paying Taxes</p>
<p>Chinese People Renting Japanese Houses Must Pay Rent in Japanese Yen</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch - During the time when Qingdao was under Japanese administration, it was regarded as its territory, so the Japanese residents living there also had supreme authority, encroaching on everything. After our country took over, the Japanese still relied on consular jurisdiction as a talisman, violating reason and law, and all kinds of barbarism were often seen. When the Japanese returned Qingdao, in addition to retaining some official residences, there were still many Japanese residents occupying government property, and negotiations to move out were ineffective. Some had lived for several years and had not paid rent to the government, and the official authorities could do nothing. As for Japanese residents who built houses and rented them to Chinese people, they had to pay rent in Japanese yen. The matter was unfair, and nothing could be more so. Therefore, the Chinese people were extremely angry. Yesterday, more than 100 citizen representatives, including Dong Chengting, went to various party and government agencies to petition, and jointly prepared a petition, requesting the municipal government to notify the Japanese consulate to instruct Japanese residents to abolish the yen-denominated rent and calculate it in the common national currency to respect sovereignty and maintain the monetary system, and to print and distribute a declaration, spreading it inside and outside the city, and awakening the citizens to fight together. The document submitted by the representatives to the Municipal Party Department reads, in brief, as follows: "Since the city was taken over, the Japanese have built a large number of houses in this port due to the historical relationship of having administered Qingdao for several years. The habit of paying rent for renting Japanese houses in Japanese yen has not changed to this day. Since the price of gold has soared last year, one silver dollar can only be exchanged for more than four jiao of Japanese old-fashioned tickets. Those who rent Japanese houses have unknowingly increased their burden by more than double, and the national currency has the force of general use. Anyone, no matter who, shall not refuse to accept it within the territory of the country or where national sovereignty has reached. Therefore, private contracts and international trade are calculated at the price of the currency of the place of conduct. Japanese residents, in the territory of our country, continue their habit of using gold notes, and do not reform where their interests lie, which is harmful to national sovereignty. This is the first thing that should be negotiated and reformed. The financial market has a fixed rate. Too high or too low will harm the people. Although rents in this city are high, the landlords' income is only about 15% when calculated based on the cost of construction. Now, the Japanese residents calculate in Japanese yen, and their income is nearly 40%, which is a heavy profit and exploitation based on the legal 20% interest rate and should be curbed. This is the second thing that should be negotiated and reformed in terms of economic balance. All taxes borne by Japanese residents in this city are calculated and paid in national currency, but their income insists on converting house rent at the price of Japanese yen. Compared with the tax burden of our people, not only is it reduced invisibly, but the surplus profit is actually huge. The injustice of our people is beyond this. This is the third thing that should be negotiated and reformed. In short, the economic principle is to unify the currency. If the currency is not unified, it will be too high or too low, and the financial market will inevitably be chaotic. The disadvantages are that all industries will be depressed and the market will be deserted. Those who are harmed by financial conversion are unimaginable, and even those who benefit from it will inevitably be affected. Considering that you have a broad range of plans and measures, and in order to develop this city and relieve the suffering of merchants, these economic relations and the suffering of merchants have long been seen. In addition to submitting it directly to the municipal government, we hereby appeal to you to follow public opinion, consult with the municipal government, notify the Japanese consulate to instruct Japanese residents to abolish the gold-denominated rent, and calculate the rent according to the common currency of this city, in order to maintain people's livelihood and help the economy." (February 13th)</p>

<h3>Phoenix Aircraft Stopped by Fog, Lands in Shantou</h3>
<p>Chinese Aviator Weng Huiteng Also Arrives in Shantou</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Phoenix aircraft of the Shanghai Meixin Foreign Company, piloted by the company's manager, Ms. White (an American), flew from Shanghai to Fuzhou. On the morning of the 5th, it took off again from Fuzhou, intending to go to Guangzhou and then to the Philippines. At 3:40 PM, it passed over Shantou, but due to dense fog, it was inconvenient to navigate, so it landed at the Qilu Airport in Shantou. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life in Shantou flocked to the airport to see it. Xiang Hanping, commander of the 62nd Division, Chief of Staff Ye Minyu, and American Consul Baggallay also went to the airport to meet with Ms. White. It is reported that the aircraft is equipped with a 125-horsepower engine, and the entire aircraft is worth more than 5,400 US dollars. It can seat three people and can fly directly from Shantou to Shanghai. The words "Phoenix" are written on the front, back, left, and right of the aircraft, and the word "Shanghai" is written on the tail in English. The aircraft can also be used as a fighter plane. The Guangzhou Eighth Route Army Headquarters has ordered four large ones. This trip by Ms. White also has the nature of attracting business. Ms. White then took Commander Xiang's car to the division headquarters for rest and stayed at the American Consulate in Shantou that day. The weather was bad on the 6th, and the trip to Guangzhou was postponed.</p>

On that day, in the midst of heavy snow, two to three thousand disaster victims, supporting the old and leading the young, children crying and women wailing, emaciated and in a state of extreme misery. Now, the Shaanxi County Disaster Relief Branch believes that the philanthropists have acted righteously and bravely, allowing the disaster victims to receive relief at a critical moment in the severe winter. The disaster victims are deeply grateful for their regeneration, and the association has also sent a letter to the philanthropists to express its gratitude.</p>

Battalion Commander Cao of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Security Brigade personally led the entire company to Hougang to station and conduct patrols day and night to prevent bandits. The previous night (the 13th), a suspicious vessel was discovered in the river near Hougang by a sentry. He immediately ordered the vessel to stop, but the people on board fired a shot first. The soldiers immediately returned fire. As a result, due to the darkness, the bandits fled ashore, abandoning a ship and a gun, which were taken back for investigation.</p>
<p>Snow Collapses House, Causing Death and Injury A teahouse named Longquanyuan, opened by Shi Xiangsheng outside the Ximen Gate of the county in Xianghuaqiao, is a two-courtyard house with four bays. Seven or eight households live there. The house has been in disrepair for many years, and recently it has been raining and snowing continuously. Suddenly, at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 14th), it collapsed completely during heavy snowfall. Fortunately, there were few tea customers at the time. A man named Bai Toufa Alin was crushed to death, and Han Liangen and the mother of a silver ingot seller, A San, were seriously injured. Five or six people were slightly injured.

<p>Social Losses After Spring Snow The county has experienced continuous heavy snow in recent days. As of the night of the 14th, the snow on the ground was a foot thick, turning the area into a silver world. Pedestrians passing through the snow were submerged to their backs, a rare spring snow in recent years. More than 1,000 telephone lines in the city were damaged, and more than 800 have been repaired as of yesterday. Electric lights have also gone out and caused short circuits. Many old houses have collapsed under the weight of the snow. Ships have also capsized. Trains have been delayed as a result, traveling only one kilometer every four minutes.

<p>Tragic News of the Sinking of the Hengyi Steamboat The Hengyi steamboat of the Taily Steamboat Company in Houtai Town, the 12th district of the county (Taibo City), was solely founded by Yang Xiang of Qiangmenkou. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 14th), the steamboat departed from Houtai, towing a tugboat, and sailed to the city. At 12:00 noon, it arrived in the river in front of the Zhenyuan Silk Factory near the South Gate Water Fairy Temple. Six or seven passengers wanted to disembark urgently. The driver applied the brakes, and the passengers stood on the side of the boat facing the shore, causing the steamboat to lose control and tilt to the right. It sank into the river in less than ten minutes. At that time, there were four Cantonese people and three or four passengers on the steamboat's awning, who jumped into the river to escape and were not drowned. However, six or seven passengers who could not escape from the boat were tragically drowned, and two sailors, Meng You and others, were also reported missing. When the steamboat capsized, the tugboat behind it was spared after the crew quickly cut the cable with a knife. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the Third Public Security Branch of the jurisdiction. Branch Director Wang Weixin immediately dispatched officer Qin Enrui to lead police officers to the scene to salvage the bodies of the passengers. As of evening, not a single body had been recovered, but only water-soaked rattan baskets and passengers' seals were recovered. The officer took the steamboat's accountants, Er Bao and Lu Xingsheng, to the branch. After a preliminary hearing by Branch Director Wang, they were handed over to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation that night. After the steamboat sank into the river, the bureau hired a boat to salvage the bodies and the steamboat's hull yesterday (the 15th). It was also heard that Yang Changxiang, a partner in the Xinchangxiang Foreign Firm, and Mi He, an accountant at the Xibao newspaper, were also drowned. Since the incident, the shipowner, Yang Xiang, has fled in fear of guilt and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>

<p>Judgement in Joint Fraud Case The case of a joint major fraud, which alerted the entire county, has been repeatedly tried by the county judiciary. A judgment could have been reached earlier, but because County Magistrate Tan Yigui went to the province, Judge Shen Cheng needed to discuss with the county magistrate before making a ruling. On the 11th, County Magistrate Tan returned to Changshu to assume office. Judge Shen Cheng discussed the matter with the county magistrate and, on the afternoon of the 13th, brought Xie Sheng, the chief writer of the Dagong Daily, Xu Jinjian, the patrol officer of the Third Police Station, and Zhang Chongxi, the director of the Hai Medical Hospital, who were in custody, from the detention center. Judge Shen Cheng was promoted to the public case and brought Xie, Xu, Zhang, and others to the court. After routinely asking about their ages and origins, he stood up and announced the main text of the judgment: "Xie Sheng intends to illegally possess property for himself and uses fraud to induce others to hand over their property. He is sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for five years. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined to be one day of imprisonment for every two days. Xu Jinjian, in the course of his official duties, received bribes. He is sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for five years. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined to be one day for every two days. Zhang Chongxi intends to illegally possess property for a third person and uses fraud to induce others to hand over their property. He is sentenced to six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for one year. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined to be one day for every two days." Zhang Youliang (that is, Chongxi's father, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, once went to the Lu family for medical treatment and received a letter. He was transferred to the court to testify in this case to save his son. During the second court hearing, the official recognized that it was inappropriate and ordered him to be released on bail) concealed other people's sealed letters and was fined 60 yuan. If he is unable to pay the fine, it will be commuted to one day of imprisonment. Hu Derong (that is, the patrol chief of the Third Police Station), Jin Guidian (the clerk) were found not guilty. After the sentence was read, Xie and others declared in court that they were not satisfied and requested that the case be sent to the High Court for review, which was approved and the court was adjourned. The three were still detained.</p>

<h3>Request for Stipulations Regarding the End of Merchants' Accounting and Remittance Periods</h3>
<p>Setting a Separate Final Closing Period</p>
<p>Severing Ties with the End of the Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted a document to the Mayor, stating: "Regarding the matter of requesting stipulations, it has been investigated that the settling of accounts according to the Gregorian calendar, allowing businesses to pay and collect debts according to the original agreements, and the deadline for the city's general remittance for the 19th year of the Republic of China being February 15th of the 20th year, have been previously ordered by your esteemed office. Considering the difficulties faced by businesses, if they were to settle accounts and remit payments strictly according to the end of the Gregorian calendar year, there might be insufficient time to make arrangements. Therefore, this expedient measure was established, but it was not intended as a permanent solution. However, the success or failure of promoting the Gregorian calendar is closely related to the settlement of accounts and remittance of funds. Observing the current social situation in our city and drawing lessons from the past, since the adoption of the solar calendar since the founding of the Republic of China, it has only existed in name. Unless the accounting period is effectively shifted, it will be difficult to achieve effective promotion. The Bureau Chief believes that the only reason why the business community does not follow the Gregorian calendar for settling accounts and remitting payments is that rice and grains have just been harvested, farmers have not yet sold them, and rural debts are unclear, making it difficult to collect urban debts. In reality, this concern may not be as serious as the business community perceives. However, the business community's designated deadline of February 15th for general remittance, with the understanding that if remittance is not possible on that day, it can be extended to the next day, is entirely based on the lunar calendar. The government initially made concessions to accommodate this, but in general, it seems to tacitly acknowledge the existence of the lunar calendar, disregarding the proposals of the late Premier and the efforts of our party over the years. If, starting from this year, February 15th is permanently designated as the deadline for general remittance of accounts from the previous year, there is still a case to be made. Business ledgers usually settle accounts monthly and annually. Settling accounts in the middle of the month is not appropriate. If the original agreement is followed without specifying a clear timeframe, most businesses will consider the agreement to be based on the end of the lunar year, which will inevitably lead to confusion when combined with the Gregorian calendar, hindering the promotion of the Gregorian calendar and being unfair to industry and commerce. As far as the Bureau's humble opinion goes, the Gregorian calendar must be promoted, and the accounting period should be clearly defined. The remittance of funds should follow the accounting period, and no separate date should be set, so that the settlement of debts and liabilities has a definite period to follow. Generally, settling accounts at the end of the Gregorian calendar year is earlier than the existing lunar calendar. The business community feels that this is inconvenient. The Bureau, after considering the business situation and gathering public opinion, proposes to change the existing regulations. Starting from the 20th year of the Republic of China, the national industrial and commercial accounting year should be changed to run from March 1st of the current year to the end of February of the following year. The first closing and remittance period of each year should be the end of June, the second closing and remittance period should be the end of October, and the third and final closing and remittance period should be the end of February of the following year. Based on the previously approved case by the National Government, delaying the settlement period by one or two months would make it later than the old Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Lunar New Year settlement periods, making it convenient for both farmers and merchants. The promotion should not be difficult. The dismissal of business partners can also be handled accordingly. However, holidays and New Year customs should follow the repeated orders of the National Government and should not be changed. Furthermore, the general closing day for businesses often involves working through the night. The reason for this is that mutual remittances may be incomplete within a single day, and because it coincides with the end of the Lunar New Year, shops and residents have annual obligations to fulfill, making it impossible to focus solely on remittances, hence the need to extend the period until the next morning. Now that the general closing period is separated from the end of the year, there should be sufficient time to complete remittances during the day. For the sake of social security and business safety, it is advisable to complete remittances during the day, avoiding the need to work day and night and risk potential dangers. It is proposed that this be reformed as well, as a humble offering. If adopted by the Central Government, it is hoped that a circular will be issued to the provincial and municipal governments at the beginning of this accounting year, instructing the relevant authorities to widely publicize and effectively promote it, so that the whole country is unified without obstacles, and the adoption of the Gregorian calendar can be achieved soon. All the reasons for proposing to change the national merchants' accounting and remittance dates, whether appropriate or not, are hereby submitted to your esteemed office for review. Please promptly forward it to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for approval and implementation. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang."</p>
<h3>All Sectors Schedule Meeting to Oppose Opium Public Sales</h3>
<p>Time: 3:30 PM, 19th of this month</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, North Henan Road</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, due to rumors that the anti-smoking authorities are preparing to implement opium public sales, has decided to resolutely oppose it. It has scheduled a joint meeting of all sectors against public sales for 3:30 PM on Thursday, the 19th of this month, at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Tianhou Palace, North Henan Road, to discuss ways to collectively resist it. Tang Shaoyi, a veteran anti-smoking advocate and honorary chairman of the association, will attend and give a speech. The association's letter to various public organizations is transcribed below: Respectfully, Recently, there have been rumors from various sources that the government authorities intend to change the policy of completely banning opium and implement a public sales system, causing surprise at home and abroad. Our association has received reports from various parties, all claiming that the evidence is solid. The Ministry of Finance has recently dispatched personnel to Taiwan to investigate the local public sales system, intending to imitate it. Completely banning opium was the only proposition of the late Premier during his lifetime. The Kuomintang's party platform also recognizes opium as a strong enemy of the people. If the ban is abandoned and public sales are implemented, how can we face the late Premier and maintain the party platform? Our association, based on the late Premier's instructions and with the determination to reject drugs, has decided to oppose this opium public sales policy, which harms the country and the people, to the end. On the 13th of this month, Honorary Chairman Dr. Tang Shaoyi convened a meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss countermeasures. It was unanimously agreed that the matter concerns international reputation and the future of smoking bans. Only by gathering the strength of the entire people can we express a unified position. It is specifically set for 3:30 PM on the 19th of this month at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Tianhou Palace Bridge, to hold a joint meeting of all sectors to properly discuss effective countermeasures. We hope that each organization will send two to four representatives to attend at that time to discuss all matters together. If there are proposals, please send them to the association one day before the meeting so that they can be compiled and submitted to the general meeting for public decision."</p>
<h3>Singapore Consul-General Tang Liu Reports on the Situation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Unemployed Chinese are Frequently Arrested by the Police</p>
<p>The British Government Bans the Three Principles of the People Courses</p>
<p>Clementi Implements Crackdown on the Kuomintang</p>
<p>Riri News reported that the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held its 34th regular meeting at the Bankers' Association the night before last. In addition to discussing important cases such as tap water, Singapore Consul-General Tang Liu, who recently returned to China, reported on the situation of overseas Chinese in the area. Details are recorded below. The following is Mr. Tang's speech:</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored that the Minister has sent me to this meeting, allowing me to be close to all of you gentlemen. From now on, my knowledge will increase daily, and I am deeply honored. As for the situation of overseas Chinese in Singapore, many of you here are seniors and must already know everything. Since I have been asked, I will report to you on the general situation I know from my time in office.</p>
<p>Business Situation: In the Malay Peninsula, overseas Chinese mostly engage in rubber and tin mining. In the early years, anyone engaged in these businesses became wealthy. However, in the past six months, prices have fallen, leading to a great decline in the market and financial stagnation. Although the British government intended to stop rubber tapping in British territories to raise prices, it had little effect because other regions did not cooperate. As a result, rubber prices have not improved, affecting other overseas Chinese businesses and causing them pain. The number of unemployed workers has also been increasing daily. Before leaving office, I discussed ways to help unemployed workers with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and many enthusiastic public welfare advocates among the overseas Chinese. We wanted to temporarily maintain their livelihoods, but because raising such a large sum of money was difficult, we gradually sent them back to China. At the same time, the British government, seeing the large number of unemployed workers in the Malay Peninsula, implemented measures to restrict the entry of Chinese workers. Many of these unemployed workers turned to peddling for a living, but these peddlers were often arrested by the local police. There are three reasons for this: (1) lack of knowledge and ignorance of police regulations; (2) trying to be clever and violating police regulations; (3) the police's desires were not fulfilled, so they deliberately arrested them. The issue of peddlers is quite troublesome. They have no common sense, and even if they do not violate police regulations, they are punished for making mistakes in their speech in court. I translated and printed many copies of the police regulations and distributed them everywhere. At the same time, I hired lawyers to defend them. I also negotiated with the local government, and after that, the issue of these peddlers became a little quieter.</p>
<p>Educational Situation: In the Malay Peninsula, overseas Chinese school education has definitely improved compared to before. However, the expenses of each school are mostly donated by the board of directors or raised from overseas Chinese businessmen. Some also receive subsidies from the local government. The administrative power of education belongs to the board of directors. I only provide guidance within the possible scope. The textbooks used mostly follow the books stipulated by the Ministry of Education. However, the local government is mostly worried about the book "Three Principles of the People" and it has been banned. Although negotiations have been made, the government still refuses to make changes. This subject is no longer listed on the course schedule of each school and is only taught orally. What is lacking is that school education there does not have a unified system of education organs. There used to be an educational association, but it was suspended due to the impact of school strikes. I previously planned to set up an educational association attached to the consulate, in order to unify the administrative education of overseas Chinese, but this proposal was terminated due to my departure from office.</p>
<p>Recent Developments in Party Affairs: Before the former Governor of Singapore left office, he did not interfere with party affairs as long as there were no violations of public order. Even if the party headquarters were sometimes searched, after my negotiations, the seized documents were immediately returned to the consulate for transfer. Then, after the former Governor left office, the newly appointed Clementi took over. He governed the colony with the policy of governing Hong Kong. He paid close attention to party affairs. When the party headquarters held elections, he immediately took the opportunity to crack down on it. Now, party work still cannot be carried out openly. After several negotiations, he refused to make changes, citing many concerns.</p>
<p>General Public Security: The area is still considered peaceful. However, there are many communists. After the government captures them, they are imprisoned for several months and then deported back to China. In addition, there is a kind of secret society among overseas Chinese who often engage in armed fights and kill each other. Although I have repeatedly advised them, they are stubborn and cannot be reasoned with.</p>
<p>Extradition Issues: Criminals often flee from our country to various British territories. If we want to extradite them back to the country for handling, the government always refuses on the grounds that our country has not signed an extradition treaty with their country. It is necessary to discuss whether it is necessary for our country to sign this treaty with them and what the advantages and disadvantages are.</p>
<p>Nationality Issues: This issue is extremely difficult. The British government considers Chinese people who were born in their territory to be British citizens. According to our country's nationality law, if their father is Chinese, or if their father cannot be verified, but their mother is Chinese, they are considered Chinese. Therefore, disputes often arise. However, the most unclear thing is that Chinese people who were born in British colonies and hold passports from the British government return to China. After arriving in China, within the scope of our country's sovereignty, we naturally exercise our country's nationality law and consider them Chinese. It seems that they cannot be allowed to receive the protection of foreign consuls stationed in China. Please discuss what to do about this point.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Investigates Bad Customs of Stores and Citizens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Orders Were Issued for the Precincts in Each District to Depart</p>
<p>From the 17th to the 19th</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing that the general stores and residents in the city are clinging to accumulated habits and still have bad customs, yesterday specifically ordered the precincts in each district to order their respective substations to investigate. From the 17th to the 19th, a total of three days, each substation will assign two or three squads, led by a sergeant and four policemen, to set off separately. Each day from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, if citizens are found to have old habits, the sergeant will first give advice or warnings. If an organization or store is encountered, the sergeant will take the bureau for insincere behavior. The number of squads assigned to each district substation is recorded below: Nanshi First District, its three substations, assigned six squads; Simenwai Second District, with two substations, assigned three squads; Pudong Third District, with three substations, assigned six squads; Zhabei Changan Road Fourth District, its three substations, assigned six squads; Zhabei Baoshan Road Fifth District, with five substations, assigned ten squads; Caojiadu Sixth District, with two substations, assigned four squads.</p>

<h3>Silk Cocoon Industry Requests Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>Huang Jin Chen, Chairman of the Jiang-Zhe-Wan Silk Cocoon General Public Office Committee, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance of the National Government yesterday, stating: "The Jiaxing County Cocoon Industry Association telegraphed that the Zhejiang Provincial Government's collection of business tax on cocoons, considering them luxury goods, violates the principles of the Ministry's outline by setting the tax rate at 10 per mille, and cocoon merchants do not recognize it. According to this, silk cocoons are a major export, related to the livelihoods of farmers, industry, and commerce, and are considered even more important than general merchandise. In order to compete with Japanese silk sales, we have just submitted a request to exempt special tax on silk cocoons. As for the business tax, it is local revenue, and according to the regulations in the abolition of likin, it should not exceed 2 per mille at most. There is already a standard, so how can it be abused? Moreover, cocoons come from agriculture and are the same as rice. Reeling them into factory silk is entirely for export. Men and women workers rely on this for their livelihood, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands of people. China is founded on agriculture, so how can it be appropriate to regard fundamental production as luxury and use heavy taxes as a crackdown? Moreover, those who seek it are foreign merchants, so there is no need to consider whether foreign people indulge in luxury. The tax rates set by various provinces often favor income and do not care about people's livelihood, treating silk cocoons the same as tobacco and alcohol. This should be corrected. If the harsh tax rate in Zhejiang Province exceeds the outline by more than four times, it will inevitably lead to a sharp reduction in the amount of silkworms and a reduction in the number of factories, and the livelihoods of farmers and workers will be invisibly reduced, which will only help Japanese silk and fall into its trap. The future of Chinese silk is extremely dangerous. Previously, the Zhejiang Province set the national silk satin tax at 15 per mille. Now, thanks to your esteemed court adopting public opinion and granting corrections, limiting it to 2 per mille, we see that you value industry and follow good advice. All the Zhejiang Province's business tax on silkworm cocoons violates the original plan and is illegally and harshly collected. Please observe the dangerous situation of Chinese silk and quickly stop it to avoid increasing the arrogance of Japanese merchants, so as to maintain the entire Zhejiang cocoon industry, and there is no end to the urgent need to wait for orders. Waiting for orders to be followed, so as to appease the people, Huang Jin Chen, Chairman of the Jiang-Zhe-Wan Silk Cocoon General Public Office Committee, et al., respectfully, all."</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Industry Continues to Request Amendment of Business Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the various industry tax rules research committees the day before yesterday, stating: "Previously, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments' business tax rules for foreign cloth required a tax of 20 per mille and 15 per mille, which not only violated the outline set by the Ministry but also contradicted the principle of people's livelihood. We specifically presented the reasons and requested you to uphold justice. Recently, reading the newspapers, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to review and amend the tax rules reported by the two provinces separately. Therefore, there is a need to continue to appeal for tax reduction. For this reason, we specially send this letter, requesting you to investigate the previous situation, and quickly forward it to the Ministry of Finance for correction. All tax rates on foreign cloth should be the same as those on domestic cotton cloth, and should not exceed 2 per mille at most, in order to maintain commercial difficulties and benefit people's livelihoods. There is no end to the feeling of waiting for orders."</p>
<h3>Soy and Rice Industry's Appeal Regarding Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soy and Rice Merchants Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Respectfully replying, we received your esteemed letter yesterday, instructing us to fully express our opinions on the business tax, in order to compile cases and request the official authorities to adopt and implement them. We are deeply grateful for your esteemed association's enthusiasm for protecting the merchants and people. We will briefly state our views on the situation of our industry, hoping that you will consider them. Our industry is a brokerage, paying brokerage tax. At the beginning of the Republic of China, we changed to obtaining a registration certificate and paying both registration and business taxes. The business is real, which is to operate buying and selling on behalf of customers. Now the government is actively abolishing likin and setting new business tax rules. The brokerage tax item will be temporarily used. The Municipal Business Tax Collection Regulations Article 20, each item of donations and taxes in the city that have the same nature as the original business tax, are uniformly renamed labor tax, and are temporarily collected at the original tax rate. The same industry has registration taxes as before. Now, the Ministry of Finance plans to set special taxes for the oil beans operated by the industry, although it has not been seen in writing, there are deep concerns. Merchants are celebrating the abolition of likin and the collection of special taxes, and the special taxes are a disguised likin. Removing one harm and bringing another harm, why must likin be abolished? At present, the cost of soybeans is becoming more expensive, and the selling price of oil made by pressing is less than the original cost. Therefore, domestic oil mills are closing down one after another, and those that exist are also dying. The opportunity for life or death is tied to a single hair. If the government has the intention of supporting domestic production, then how can it bear to pick this yellow melon? Moreover, oil beans are necessities for life, not comparable to luxury goods. The customs already collects export taxes, and should be exempt from taxes. If we disregard everything and set special taxes, then one thing will be taxed several times, and oil merchants will be unable to bear the burden. It directly increases the cost to speed up its demise, and indirectly it will cause millions of oil industry workers to die. What can be imagined for the future? According to the special tax collection on cotton yarn and cloth, one kind of tax on yarn, and no longer tax on cotton cloth, because the substance belongs to only one category. Oil comes from beans, and oil beans initially belong to one category. Mother and son are born together, just like cotton yarn and cloth. According to precedents, it is even more impossible to force analysis and tax each separately. Now is the autumn of drafting tax rules. If the measures are improper, it is easy to flow into harsh levies. If the progress is hindered, and then the change is discussed, then there will be no way to show the law, and I am afraid that the prestige will be lost. We have already sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to ask for instructions. Beforehand, we are deeply willing to exempt the oil beans from special taxes in addition to the customs export tax that has already been collected, or if it is not possible, we must allocate the tax rules of cotton yarn and cloth, only including one type, and do not tax them separately, and give special reductions in one type, in order to protect national production and promote merchants' livelihoods, reduce the burden on people's livelihoods, and eliminate the danger of oil factory workers on the verge of desperation. It is beneficial to both national economy and people's livelihood. We have long admired your esteemed association's benevolence and profuse benefits, and we have prepared and reported the above reasons, hoping that you will investigate and quickly submit them to the Ministry of Finance for review and implementation, and the public will be extremely grateful."</p>
<h3>Candle Industry's Opinion on Business Tax</h3>
<p>Re-Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association issued its opinion on the tax rate issue in the city and presented it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Regarding the various sections in your esteemed letter, upon inspection, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed business tax rate in the city are not only closely related to our industry but also to the entire city's commerce. This time, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments proposed tax rates, listing items and items, as heavy as 20 per mille, arbitrarily appropriating, strengthening what merchants cannot do, and there is no need to say more. Once implemented, its trivial disturbances are indeed like a disguised likin. All the gentlemen of this city, witnessing the signs from the side, should be able to prevent problems before they occur and eliminate them. There is no need for the association to worry too much. However, as far as we have seen, the business tax law is best in Anhui. Looking at the regulations in Anhui Province's collection regulations, its fourth article stipulates that regardless of the industry or item, the standard for taxation is the size of the business, and a tax rate of 2 per mille is levied uniformly. There is neither a difference between light and heavy nor an excessive tax burden. We deeply hope that your esteemed association will adopt the opinions below and quickly submit them to the Tax Rules Committee for consideration. If the situation in this city is different and it is difficult to learn from, the authorities will naturally have something to tell us. However, the association should compete for a tax rate of 2 per mille for several industries. We hope that all the public in your esteemed association and the Tax Rules Committee will announce it."</p>

<h3>Another Cold Wave Imminent in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Report from the Observatory</p>
<p>Water Pipes and Cars Must be Protected</p>
<p>According to news from the Xujiahui Observatory, another cold wave may visit Shanghai within the next day or two. According to the telegram received by the observatory the night before last, severe cold has been observed in Irkutsk, Siberia, where the thermometer has dropped to minus 40 degrees Celsius (equivalent to minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit). However, the cold air encountered by Irkutsk in mid-last month was moving south, leading to its penetration into the Yangtze River basin. The coldness of the climate in Shanghai, Hankou, and other ports was unseen for decades. This time, it is moving southeast, so the impact on Shanghai may be relatively minor. According to past experience, the journey of cold air from Siberia to Shanghai usually takes about two days. If it does visit this time, its cold power should be felt tonight. Residents are advised to take precautions for water pipes and cars to prevent freezing and damage.</p>
<h3>Comprador Lu Mingsheng of Mei Di Foreign Firm Kidnapped Yesterday</h3>
<p>Incident Occurred on Guangxi Road</p>
<p>Car Has Been Found</p>
<p>Kidnapping bandits in Shanghai have recently become extremely active. A total of three cases occurred last week. After Li Huiqing was kidnapped, followed by Lin Weiqing and his wife and grain merchant He Jiechun, the Lin couple narrowly escaped danger, which can be said to be great fortune. At 1:15 AM yesterday morning, a similar case was discovered on Guangxi Road in the Public Concession. The kidnapped person was Lu Mingsheng, comprador of Mei Di Firm. At the time, he had just come out from entertaining at a brothel. After getting into the car, he was kidnapped by four bandits. The car, which Lu himself provided, license number 62, was found yesterday on Route Paul Brunat in the French Concession, but the victim's whereabouts are still unknown. Lu Mingsheng is a local, living at 1135 Wuding Road. Mei Di Firm is located in the HSBC Bank building at 12 The Bund, specializing in the import and export of tobacco leaves. Lu has worked in the firm for many years.</p>
<h3>Clues Emerge in the Haig Road Bloodshed Case</h3>

His brother, Cui Zhen, is currently a third-class police officer at the 6th District, 2nd Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. His father is dead. He has an old mother, Liu, over 70 years old, and a wife, Ping, 40 years old, who works as a factory worker in a nearby overshoe factory. He only left behind a nine-year-old orphan, Guiying. The household expenses are all supported by Ping's salary, and life is very poor. Yesterday's report that Cui Lao Qi was in the money lending business was a rumor and not a fact.</p>
<p>Disciple Appeals for Justice: After the incident, Liu Yunfang, director of the 6th District, 2nd Precinct, went to the scene of the incident to investigate. The murderer was ambushed in the wasteland next to Jin Sheng Ji Tailor Shop (surrounded by bamboo fences along the road). He then summoned the corpse to the precinct for questioning. Then, the deceased's disciple, Wu Xiaozhang (nicknamed Pi Peifu), declared that his master (i.e., Lao Qi) had no enemies and had no ill feelings towards his brothers and friends. He was on good terms with a Xu from Lianfa Lane No. 16 in the town. After learning of his master's murder this morning, he went to inquire at Xu's place. According to Xu, Lao Qi went out around 10:00 AM yesterday, went to the Huiji bicycle shop upstairs at the entrance of Xiaoyou Lane to smoke until about 2:00 AM the day before yesterday, went to Shunxing Restaurant for snacks, and when he went home, he saw three or four strangers following him. Cui suspected nothing and was assassinated in front of Jin Sheng Ji Tailor Shop.</p>
<p>Cause of the Murder: Then he also claimed that the master's murder was planned by Xiao Hei Tan (i.e., Cao Genfa) and others. The reason was that a month ago, Xiao Hei Tan (i.e., Cao Genfa) and Jiang Afu had a quarrel at the Changle Tanhuang Theater over harassing women, which led to a fight. Later, the master (i.e., Lao Qi) helped Jiang Afu beat Xiao Hei Tan, and they feared that he held a grudge and killed the master. Moreover, Xiao Hei Tan and his wife went to the master's house upstairs on the evening of the 13th to smoke (the upstairs is a gambling den opened by someone else). It is now found that Xiao Hei Tan has been living in the Huimin Hotel on Tayside Road behind Haige Lane for many days. After the incident, they fled together. A local, Hu Damaogou, is also friendly with Xiao Hei Tan. Where Cao Genfa is hiding, he must know the details. The master borrowed fifty yuan from Hu's mother-in-law and never asked for it back. In the last two or three days, Hu Damaogou has repeatedly asked the master to return the money. It can be known that Hu already knew about the master's murder, fearing that the money would be lost. Because of the above reasons, Hu Damaogou must know the details of the master's murder.</p>
<p>Searching for the Murderers: After receiving the report, Director Liu immediately sent Patrol Officer Yuan to Zhensong Road to the French Concession Police Station, dispatching police to investigate the Huimin Hotel. According to the hotel waiter, Cao Genfa led six or seven men and women to open rooms 14 and 16 on the 6th of this month. On the 11th, he suddenly changed his name to Zhu Genfa. Around 2:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, two people suddenly entered and called out Genfa's wife to go out, and they have not returned to this day. When they left, their expressions were flustered, and they rented a car from the Asia Motor Company next door and drove east, etc. Afterwards, after searching the room, there were no other items, only two umbrellas and a pair of broken shoes were left behind. Upon returning to the precinct for further verification,</p>
<p>Detaining the Suspects: Director Liu ordered the police to arrest the suspects within a limited time, since all the murderers had fled. He immediately arrested a suspect, Hu Damaogou, and brought him to the precinct. After repeated interrogations by Director Liu, he confessed that he was 28 years old, a local, living at 37 Haig Road, and worked as a watchman at Lisheng Company. He really did not know about Cui Laoqi's murder, and he was on duty at the company the night of the incident and did not return home until 7:00 AM. Xiao Hei Tan is an old friend of more than ten years, and he does not know where he lives now. His confession was cunning. Director Liu believed that the case involved human life and was a serious matter. He then drew up a rough sketch and, together with the witness Wu Xiaozhang (i.e., Wu Peifu), the corpse's younger brother Cui Zhen, and the suspect Hu Damaogou, were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Leader of the Dagu Road Robbery Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Huashui, also Known as Da Kuai Tou</p>
<p>The residence at 1175 Chengqi Lane, Dagu Road, was robbed on the evening of the 5th of this month. Upon receiving the report, the police sent detectives to arrest the robbers. They fought with the robbers on the spot, killing and wounding four and capturing fifteen alive, as reported in this newspaper. The leader of the robbery was Chen Huashui from Shaoxing, also known as Da Kuai Tou. After the incident, he hid on Xinzha Road. Until the other day, he was arrested by detective Shang Wu of the Huisi Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu interrogated him and ordered him to be detained, pending further interrogation in conjunction with the case.</p>
<h3>Pawnshops to Extend Business Hours Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Association will extend the hours for receiving pawned items until 12:00 PM today, as today is the final deadline for businesses in Shanghai to settle accounts, to facilitate the common people.</p>
<h3>Operation of Trolleybuses in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>New Suitable Routes to be Opened</p>
<p>Smaller Vehicles to be Used</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession considers that the streets on which most trolleybuses operate are too narrow, especially Henan Road and Sichuan Road. It intends to order the trolleybuses to be rerouted to run along the Bund to avoid the current congestion. The issue was submitted to the Council's Public Utilities Committee for discussion. According to Deputy Secretary-General Jones of the Municipal Council, the Council has the right to manage the routes of public buses according to the contract, but trams and trolleybuses are not included. The committee then sought the opinion of the Commissioner of Public Works, who said that Jiangxi Road is the most unsuitable road for trolleybuses. However, the Commissioner believed that the proposal to reroute trolleybuses to the Bund could not be implemented because there are already many trams and public buses traveling on the section between Nanjing Road and Beijing Road, lacking wide roads. Moreover, the Suzhou Creek has no solid bridge sufficient to make public transport more difficult. The only way to solve this problem is to build wide avenues and solid bridges. The Commissioner will consult with the Tramway Company and the Public Bus Company on whether new routes can be opened. Regarding the committee member's concern that tram passengers are too crowded, the Commissioner cited the total number of passengers on various public vehicles, saying that the existing tracks are only one meter wide, and it is impossible to use larger vehicles. As for the current trolleybuses, they are specially made to run on narrow streets. As a result of the committee's discussion, (1) the Commissioner of Public Works was requested to contact the public transport companies to increase the number of vehicles to determine whether the increase is sufficient to meet the increased demand. The committee members all said that an annual report should be prepared for reference. (2) The proposal of the Additional Superintendent of Police was approved, requesting the Public Bus Company to use smaller vehicles to operate on narrower streets. The proposal will be submitted to the company for consideration.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Investigating Impersonation and Fraud</h3>
<p>Forged Stationery of the Bureau's Personnel Section</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has discovered that someone has printed stationery for the Personnel Section of the Shanghai Special District Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau, affixed with the bureau's Personnel Section stamp, and dared to impersonate the bureau, distributing requests for relief in various circles. The bureau's internal organization is divided into the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Sections, and there is no Personnel Section. This matter is entirely a scam by unscrupulous people. Therefore, in addition to strict investigation, it also notifies all circles not to be deceived.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Company Selling Large Property</h3>
<p>Opposite the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Company's property opposite the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road, facing Jing'an Temple Road on one side and Route Maybert on the other, covering approximately 21 mu of land, was recently sold to a company jointly formed by Yeguang Company, Sassoon &amp; Co., and China Land Company. It is said that the sale price is around 100,500 taels per mu.</p>
<h3>Wu Lien-teh Enthusiastic About the Asiatic Society</h3>
<p>Generously Donates 20,000 Taels</p>
<p>The Royal Asiatic Society, founded by British people on Museum Road in Shanghai, is one of the international academic organizations, with an attached museum and library. Many Chinese and foreign scholars are members. The association building has been standing for a long time and is in danger of collapse, urgently in need of reconstruction. The fundraising committee is actively raising funds. In addition to the Municipal Council's grant of 50,000 taels and the 25,000 taels already collected from Chinese and foreign circles, Dr. Wu Lien-teh of the National Epidemic Prevention Office personally donated 20,000 taels to see the new building completed as soon as possible. It is also heard that Wu believes that the price of gold is soaring and that most of the building materials are imported from abroad, with prices rising daily. This fundraising must collect at least 150,000 taels so that the society can expand its scope and have closer contact with Chinese scholars and scientists, so that it can become a large academic organization in East Asia in the future. The person in charge of the association is deeply grateful for Wu's enthusiastic support. It is said that the auditorium will be named after him in the future as a memorial.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Prices Soar After Rain and Snow</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, Shanghai has been continuously raining and snowing. After the heavy snow the day before yesterday, the snow on the road has not yet melted, and the muddy and slippery snow makes walking difficult. Yesterday noon, the sky briefly showed sunlight, and the general residents all felt that it was too humid. Business in commercial establishments was also greatly affected. Just as people were happy that it could clear up, suddenly at 2:00 PM, there was a drizzle again. Pedestrians were all splattered with mud, feeling greatly inconvenienced. In the small vegetable markets in the Chinese and French Concessions, the prices of meat and vegetables were very high due to the scarcity of sources. Chickens were sold for one yuan per catty, green fish for one and a half yuan per catty. Not only were other fish expensive, they were also as rare as morning stars. Fresh shrimp, etc., could not be bought anywhere. Vegetables such as cabbage cost 1,500 cash per catty, spinach 400 cash per catty, green vegetables 600 cash per catty. Other fruits, etc., also rose in price. Oranges cost two jiao per piece, several times higher than before. The poor people were all crying out in misery.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Exchange Rate Plummets</h3>
<p>Lack of Copper Coins in the Market</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year is approaching, small money shops and tobacco shops are taking this opportunity to shorten the exchange rate. Yesterday's exchange rate for silver dollars was shortened to 244 or 245 copper coins per silver dollar, and 10 jiao plus 14 or 15 copper coins for a small dollar (i.e., double dime). Each double dime was exchanged for 440 or 450 cash. According to people in the money exchange business, there is a lack of copper coins in the market, and even if there are, they are unwilling to exchange them, so it is impossible to exchange large amounts of copper coins for a while, which is why the dollar price has been shortened so much.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies in the French Concession Last Night</h3>
<p>Route Tenant de Vernaison: At 7:50 PM last night, 6 or 7 robbers suddenly came to Zhang Dehe Tailor Shop at 23 Jin Yu Lane, Chujia Bridge, Route Tenant de Vernaison, French Concession. Three robbers held guns and stood guard downstairs, and three robbers went upstairs, directly to the home of Zhu Liu, a woman from Jiangbei, in the front building, turning boxes and overturning cabinets, searching almost everywhere. While the robbers were robbing, the woman suddenly threw a paper bag containing gold jewelry under the table, hoping to avoid the robbers' eyes. Unexpectedly, a robber had already spotted it and rushed forward to grab it. In desperation, the woman set the kerosene lamp on the table on fire on the floor and shouted for help. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers hurriedly went downstairs, broke through the door and fled. Fortunately, the gold jewelry was not robbed, and only more than 30 double dimes and more than 20 yuan in current money were lost. Afterwards, the woman opened a list of losses, reported to the Grand Stand Police Station for investigation.</p>
<p>Rue du Marché: At around 8:00 PM last night, five robbers suddenly came to Gong Changyu Coal Company at 116 Baoyu Lane, entrance of Rue du Marché, French Concession.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The robbers each held a handgun, prohibiting them from making a sound. They robbed a gold ring and dozens of yuan in cash, carrying the stolen goods and trying to escape through the door. It happened that the store was in the lunar New Year’s season, and several relatives who were boatmen from the same profession picked up two handguns with live ammunition. They immediately brought them into the police station for strict interrogation, and they will be sent to the court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Five People Die from Coal Poisoning</h3>
<p>The Tragic Fate of Tan Daxi's Family</p>
<p>Tan Daxi from Yancheng arrived in Shanghai a few days ago with a full load of goods from his hometown. He berthed on the Suzhou Creek at the Hongyu Yarn Factory near the Broadway pier. The continuous rain and snow, coupled with the biting cold, led him to light a coal stove in the boat for warmth in the evening. However, the small cabin was filled with fumes overnight, and several members of his family suffered from coal poisoning. Four of them, both men and women, died from severe poisoning, while the remaining three were on the verge of death. Yesterday, they were discovered by a neighboring boat and rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. A boatman named Zhu Dengjin, aged thirty-six, passed away in the hospital at 10:30 last night. The remaining two have shown slight signs of improvement after the doctor's diagnosis, and there is hope for their recovery. The names and ages of the deceased are listed below: Tan Daxi, thirty-six years old; his sister-in-law, Gao, twenty-five years old; a young female boat hand, twenty years old; a child, only three years old. Zhu Dengjin, who died in the hospital last night, was thirty-three years old. The two remaining in the hospital are his younger brother, Xiao Xizi, thirty-four years old, and his wife, Chen, twenty-eight years old.</p>
<h3>Chen Shengji Confirmed to Have No Connection to Lu Shaotang Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Court Acquits Him the Other Day</p>
<p>In the kidnapping case of Lu Shaotang, a compradore at the Equitable Trading Company, the police have apprehended as many as forty-three suspects and are still investigating and interrogating them. According to the police investigation, Chen Shengji is confirmed to have no involvement. He was sent to the Special District Court a few days ago with a request for his immediate release to avoid implicating an innocent person. Chen's lawyer, Fan Gang, also made the same request, which was approved by Presiding Judge Zhou Hanting, and Chen was released.</p>
<h3>Abusing Hometown Ties for Evil Deeds</h3>
<p>Zhang Xieji Seduces Wang Jindi</p>
<p>Madam Shi, a local woman residing at No. 23, Shi's Family Residence, Shenjiahang, Mayushan Road, Yangshupu, had a son named Shunsheng, aged twenty. Last month, through a matchmaker, he engaged Wang Jindi, a woman from Haimen, also twenty years old, as his wife. She immediately joined the family, but due to superstitious beliefs that the year was unfavorable, the wedding was postponed until May.  However, unwilling to simply provide food and lodging, she was sent to work in a yarn factory. There, Zhang Xieji, a worker in a construction factory near Tilanqiao, took advantage of their shared Haimen origin to seduce and rape her. He also lured Wang Jindi into running away with him. Fortunately, a female coworker, Dong Yangshi, witnessed the events. When Shi Yu's wife noticed her daughter-in-law's absence and inquired with Dong Yangshi, she revealed the truth. Shi Yu's wife filed a complaint with the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, and Zhang was arrested and handed over to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Carelessness at Ning Shao Warehouse</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Bales of Cotton Burned</p>
<p>The Ning Shao Steamship Company's No. 1 warehouse at the Sixteenth Pier in the South City was rebuilt after a fire last year. The new building, recently completed, was constructed entirely of steel, concrete, and red bricks. All sides were fitted with extremely clear glass windows to allow light to enter. Yesterday morning around seven o'clock, six thousand catties of Ningo cotton cloth destined for Shanghai, totaling four hundred bales, each valued at over twenty taels, were being carried into the warehouse by coolies and divided into two piles. After the unloading was completed, the warehouse door was locked. Unexpectedly, around ten o'clock, thick smoke suddenly emerged from a gap in the warehouse window. A passerby noticed and realized that a fire had broken out inside. They immediately reported it to the Fire Brigade via telephone, and the alarm bell was rung. Soon after, fire brigades from various districts arrived on the scene with their pump trucks. They first opened the windows and doors and saw a pile of cotton in the middle engulfed in thick smoke and raging flames. They immediately drew water to extinguish the fire. It took about half an hour to put out the fire and eliminate the smoke, preventing a major disaster. Fortunately, the fire was discovered early, and only over ten bales of cotton, worth about two hundred and several tens of taels, were burned.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Fundraising in the Name of a Fake Journalist Association</h3>
<p>Two months ago, the Shanghai Journalists Association received a double-registered return receipt from the post office bearing the name "Shanghai Journalists Association Fifth Branch Tong." Upon investigation, the Association had no branch establishments, and there was no one named Tong. It was clearly a case of a rogue trying to extort money under a false name. Yesterday morning (the 15th) at ten o'clock, a person named Fan Genda visited the Association looking for Tong Zhiqing. Under questioning by the Association's staff, he claimed to work at the Tongshang Inn on Nicheng Bridge and that he had met Tong once. Recently, Tong visited the inn while a relative of Fan's was involved in a lawsuit and needed a lawyer. Tong claimed to work for the Shanghai Journalists Association and could provide assistance, requesting a reward of thirty to forty yuan. He arranged to meet again at the inn to discuss the matter, but Tong had not arrived by nine o'clock, so Fan came to the Association to inquire. The Association, considering the matter a case of impersonation and fraud punishable by law, is currently conducting a thorough investigation and will request the authorities to handle the case seriously.</p>
<h3>Russian Dentist Sues Russian Newspaper Staff</h3>
<p>Seeking Compensation for Damage to Reputation</p>
<p>Russian dentist Kraqingke, represented by lawyers Baek and Bahe, filed a lawsuit in the public court, stating that on October 2nd of last year, the husband of a Russian woman, Volguval, was introduced by Gongji Hospital to the plaintiff's office to have a molar extracted. Unexpectedly, after returning home, he suddenly fell ill and died on the 23rd of the same month. A Western doctor confirmed that he had died from meningitis. However, Volguval colluded with Chai Laifu and Al Daidufu, staff members of a Russian newspaper, to publish articles defaming the plaintiff. The husband of the first defendant did die of illness and not from the tooth extraction. The plaintiff has a good reputation as a dentist in Shanghai, but since the defendants published articles damaging his reputation, his business has suffered greatly. The first defendant can be forgiven for the mental distress caused by her husband's death, but the second and third defendants, being newspaper staff, were motivated by revenge after the plaintiff refused to place advertisements with them, and intentionally damaged the plaintiff's reputation, which amounts to extortion. The plaintiff requests that they be investigated and held accountable, and that compensation be paid for the losses suffered. Judge Zhu ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation and review.</p>
<h3>Peng Fuxing Did Not Kill the Flower Association King</h3>
<p>But Has Committed Kidnapping and Other Cases in Changzhou</p>
<p>Peng Fuxing, a native of Changzhou, was recently apprehended by the police and brought to the Special District Court on suspicion of involvement in the shooting death of Flower Association leader Liu Lianghong. Presiding Judge Cheng interrogated him a few days ago. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang, the police had received an anonymous letter stating that Peng had committed a major kidnapping case in Wujin. Judge Cheng then announced that Wujin County had sent a letter requesting his transfer to their jurisdiction, and the court had replied, awaiting the dispatch of bailiffs to the court for further verification. Subsequently, prisoners Zhang Guoqing and Zhang Acai were brought from the West Prison and testified that the Peng Fuxing they had previously identified as the murderer of Liu was someone else, and they did not recognize the person who had been arrested. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending verification.</p>
<h3>Child Missing, Extortion of One Hundred Gold</h3>
<p>Two People Detained</p>
<p>Genbao, the five-year-old son of Shen Wenxin, a resident of No. 558 South Chengdu Road, suddenly went missing on the 2nd of this month. Recently, threatening letters have been received stating that if one hundred yuan is paid, Genbao will be returned. The money should be delivered to the letter box on the lamppost at the intersection of Rue Massenet and Route Paul Beau at 7 PM on the 13th. Shen reported the letter to the Xinzha police station, who sent detectives to the location as scheduled. A man named Lin Afu was seen reaching into the letter box, and was immediately arrested by detectives lying in ambush nearby. Lin confessed that Li Jinbiao, from the same household as the victim, had initiated the abduction. Li was also arrested, but he refused to reveal Genbao's whereabouts. The next morning, Lin and Li were brought to the Special District Court. After interrogation by Judge Cheng, they were ordered to be detained pending the discovery of the child.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Transports Road Materials for Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Due to the large quantities of steel rails, ties, and vehicle materials needed for the construction of the Xiaochang Railway, the Engineering Department of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau was ordered to send personnel to Shanghai to purchase a large batch of steel rails and ties. Over 13,600 steel rails and 150,000 ties have already been purchased and transported by ship to the Rihuigang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. For days, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been transporting them to Hangzhou. Forty cars of steel rails, each carrying 160 rails (a total of 6,400 rails), and ninety cars of ties, each carrying 600 ties (approximately 54,000 ties), have been shipped. There are still approximately 100,000 ties awaiting transport, requiring 170 cars, and over 7,200 steel rails, requiring 45 cars. In order to expedite the project, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has consulted with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau and requested that they expedite the transportation, aiming to allocate 60 cars per day for two weeks. The Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has instructed the dispatch department to find ways to increase the number of cars and load them to their maximum capacity for transportation to Hangzhou. Freight trains No. 26 and 28 will be exclusively used for transporting materials for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, starting from the 16th to the 20th of this month, and special trains will be added for transport to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the National Medical Association</h3>
<p>The National Medical Association held its third joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees the other day. The following executive committee members were present: Xu Naili, Niu Huisheng, Cai Yumen, Pang Jingzhou, Xia Qichu, Zhu Qiluo, and Jiang Zhenxun. Supervisory committee members present were Chu Minyi and Wang Wanbai. Alternate executive committee member Song Guobin and secretary Zhu Shanji were also present. Xu Naili chaired the meeting, and the following matters were discussed: (1) Regarding the vacancy due to the death of Executive Committee member Yu Fengbin, it was resolved that Zhu Qiluo, the next highest-ranking alternate executive committee member, would fill the vacancy according to the law. (2) Regarding the Association's registration with the competent authorities, it was resolved to request registration with the competent authorities immediately. (3) Regarding Supervisory Committee member Hou Ximin's proposal on whether the Association should participate in the National Assembly, it was resolved to send the "National Assembly Representative Election Implementation Law Regulations" to member organizations in various regions and urge them to pay attention and not abandon their responsibilities. (4) Regarding Supervisory Committee member Hou Ximin's proposal on whether the Association's second representative congress could be convened earlier in April, it was resolved that due to the time required for preparation, it would be impossible to convene it in April, and it could not be moved forward. (5) Regarding the "Regulations on Higher Examinations for Western Medicine Physicians," which were promulgated by the Examination Yuan on December 27, 1919, it was resolved that the current examination regulations were not necessary during the period of political tutelage and that, according to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions, professional examinations were not within the purview of the Examination Yuan. Therefore, the Association advocated that it should unite with medical societies to jointly petition the authorities to make corrections. (6) Regarding a letter from a member of the Ningbo Medical Association stating that the local party headquarters had ordered the reorganization of the association because its membership was less than fifty, which did not comply with the Law on the Organization of Professional Associations, and requesting the Association to discuss a solution, it was resolved that, according to Article 2 of the draft rules of the Medical Association of the Ministry of Health, the organization of medical associations should be based on the number of physicians in each city and county, with a city and county medical association established in each city and county when the number of physicians reaches ten or more. The local party headquarters had ordered a reorganization, so it should be clarified to the local party headquarters, and a reply should be made later. (7) Regarding a letter from a member of the Ningbo Medical Association inquiring about the Ministry's registration regulations, it was resolved to provide a detailed reply regarding the latest issues with Ministry registration. (8) Regarding whether the Association should issue membership badges to members of local medical associations, it was resolved to do so after the Association's registration. (9) Regarding a letter from the Preparatory Office of the National New Medical Industry General Association requesting that it continue to proceed according to the recently resolved method, it was resolved to do so.</p>
<h3>Doctor Registration in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Chinese Western Medical Association Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Chinese Western Medical Association convened an emergency meeting the other day, chaired by Qian Longzhang, to discuss the implementation of doctor registration in the French Concession. He reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the regulations for doctor registration in the French Concession were harsh, and the Association had been negotiating, but without satisfactory results. Now the authorities were suddenly acting swiftly, leaving no room for delay. The assembly agreed that (1) another letter should be sent to the authorities, stating that while the Ministry of Health was being merged into the Ministry of Interior and renamed as an agency, it had not yet been officially established, and the Health Bureau had stopped issuing licenses. Therefore, a more flexible approach should be adopted, allowing members with certificates from medical associations to pay fees and obtain licenses to practice medicine. (2) If doctors from outside the concession needed to register to treat patients within the concession, how should cases where families invited doctors from other areas to treat patients within the concession be handled? It was resolved to express opposition and make a strong case. (3) A letter should be sent to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession to assist in the process. Several other important matters were discussed before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The Chinese Western Medical Association sent a letter yesterday to Du Yuesheng, Shang Mujiang, and Xu Zhusun, the three chairmen of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, saying (the preamble is omitted). "Respectfully, the French Concession Municipal Council is implementing doctor registration. All doctors residing within the concession and those from outside the concession who practice medicine within the French Concession must register and obtain a license. The regulations for doctor registration for Chinese doctors stipulate that they must hold certificates from the Ministry of Health or the Health Bureau and be approved by the Health Department of the Municipal Council before being allowed to pay fees and obtain licenses to practice medicine. However, the Ministry of Health has been merged into the Ministry of Interior and renamed as an agency, but it has not yet been officially established, and the Health Bureau has also stopped doctor registration and has no authority to issue licenses. Under these circumstances, the Health Department of the Municipal Council is acting swiftly and urgently, leaving no room for delay. Any delay will result in fines and other penalties, causing constant alarm and disruption. There are rumors of orders to cease business. Such obstruction is not only destructive to Chinese doctors but also has a significant impact on the people's livelihood. We deeply admire your association's fairness and contribution to society. Regarding the doctor registration issue, in this predicament, we earnestly request that you find ways to protect our interests and negotiate with the French Concession authorities to adopt a peaceful approach and make some flexibility. Before our country's Health Agency is officially established and the Health Bureau resumes registration, those holding formal medical association certificates should be allowed to pay fees and obtain licenses to practice medicine. The region and its patients will be grateful. (The conclusion is omitted)."</p>
<h3>Opinions of People from Cao Tang, Tangbei, Zhuanma, and Five Townships in Northern Shanghai County Regarding the Location of the County Seat</h3>
<p>The relocation of the Shanghai County seat has been actively underway since the establishment of the Promotion Association and the Design Committee, and its realization is expected soon. However, the issue of the county seat's location has not yet been decided despite repeated meetings. It is now known that the people from Cao Hang, Tang Wan, Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Maqiao, and other five townships in the county all agree that the location of the new county seat should be north of Yu Tang. Therefore, Design Committee members Niu Changyao, Shi She, and Peng Liren drafted opinions and detailed drawings for reference. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The issue of the county seat's location has been discussed at numerous meetings of this Association, but a decision has not yet been made. Indeed, the location of the county seat is the first step in the new construction of the entire county, which is related to the future development of the cause. It is a century-long plan and should be carefully studied and observed. During the previous group review, Changyao and others were appointed by the General Assembly to study the Tangbei group and submitted their opinions to the meeting. However, time passed quickly, and there was no time to explain them in detail. After further discussion and re-survey, Changyao and others still believe that it is more appropriate to locate the county seat north of Yu Tang. Therefore, the research opinions, together with the design drawings, are supplemented as follows. The decision to locate the county seat east of the Shanghai-Minhang Road and north of Yu Tang was made by the Jiangsu Provincial Government as early as 1918. It was not only based on the suitability of the location but also to take into account the development of all parties. Since the discussion of the relocation of the county seat was initiated by people in various districts, there has never been a discussion of land south of Yu Tang. It is not that they are unaware that there is plenty of land south of Yu Tang for the construction of the new county seat, but they are afraid that the further south it is located, the more it will deviate from the central purpose. Now the county government is acting cautiously and still submitting the location issue to the meeting for discussion, precisely because the development of local undertakings is related to the need to seek details and conduct serious research. This intention is worthy of admiration. Changyao and others are local people and are deeply aware of the terrain and conditions of each district in the county. They dare not be partial or selfish and have no prejudices. They only hope that the issue of relocation will be realized as soon as possible and that the construction of the new Shanghai County will proceed as soon as possible, so as not to fail the hopes of the people of the county who have been known for their traffic with China and foreign countries for many years. Therefore, they dare not refrain from being humble and humbly offer their opinions for reference. (A) The location of the county seat should be the central hub of water and land transportation in the county. (1) In terms of waterways in the county, on the west bank of the Huangpu River, there are three main rivers running north and south: Hengli, Shafa, and Gang. Running east and west, there are Yu Tang, Liulei Tang, and Huajing Port. On the east bank of the Huangpu River, there are Zhoupu Tang and Sanlin Tang. Among these, the Hengli River is the best and most important waterway. Starting from the Huangpu River in the south, it passes through Minhang, Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Xinzhuang, and Qibao, and goes north to the Wusong River. The market towns along the river all rely on it for the transportation of goods. It meanders for dozens of miles and has many uses. The location of the county seat should be as close to this river as possible. Although the Shazhu Gang rivers are also wide, there are few market towns along their banks and they are biased to the southwest. There are fewer users of the county seat, so the county seat should be located north of Yu Tang. The reason for this is obvious. (2) The east-west flowing main rivers in the county are prone to siltation due to the tides, but they are all important waterways connecting various districts. For example, Yu Tang passes through Maqiao to the west and connects to Songjiang. Another example is that Liulei Tang starts from Songjiang in the west, passes through Zhuanqiao and Caohang, and goes to the inner and outer car stops to connect to the Huangpu River, directly connecting to Zhoupu Tang, passing through Tangkou and Chenhang, and directly to Zhoupu. Huajing Port connects to Chunshen Tang in the west, passes through Xinzhuang, Wengbanqiao, and Huajing, and goes to the Huangpu River, diagonally connecting to Sanlin Tang and directly reaching Sanlin Town. Locating the county seat in the northern part of Yu Tang, by leveraging the north-south passage of the Hengli River, the three main rivers have been conveniently connected, becoming the center of the waterways of several townships on the west bank of the Huangpu River, and integrating the two districts on the east bank of the Huangpu River. (3) Among the land routes in the county, the Shanghai-Minhang Road and the Beihui Road have already been completed. The Shanghai-Minhang Road enters the county from the northeast and passes through Qianliangdui, Zhuanqiao, and Beiqiao to Minhang. The Beihui Road starts from Beiqiao, runs along the north bank of Yu Tang, passes through Maqiao to the west, reaches Huqiao, and connects to Songjiang. The Beitang Road, which will be built soon, also starts from Beiqiao, runs along the north bank of Yu Tang, and reaches Tangwan to the east. According to the plan already set by the County Construction Bureau, the Beitang Road will be extended to the outer car stop, cross the Huangpu River, and connect to the Tiantang Road. Starting from Tangkou, it passes through Chenhang and Zhuanqiao to Tianhua Temple, connecting to the Shangnan Motor Road. The Changmin Road starts from Changqiao in the city, passes through Guangang, the outer car ditch, and the kiln factory to Minhang, and is the main road connecting the north and south banks of the county along the Huangpu River. After this plan is realized, it will be connected to the two districts on the east bank of the Huangpu River. Looking at all the completed and planned roads, their hub is north of Yu Tang. Therefore, the location of the county seat is more suitable in the north. Based on the above three points, considering the water and land transportation in the northern part of Yu Tang, a simple comparison of the situation in the two places is as follows: (1) The southern part of Yu Tang is farther away from the Hengli River. Although it is close to Zhu Gang, there is still a distance of three li, and the basin is not wide, the waterline is not long, and it is biased towards the southwest of the county. It also does not have the status of connecting important market towns in the county. Instead of moving south and west, losing both benefits, it is better to move north and east, specializing in one. (2) The east-west main rivers in the southern part of Yu Tang are all in the rear. The rivers are separated in front and behind the northern part of Yu Tang. Plus, the Hengli River runs through it from north to south, providing a practical way of connecting and connecting, and the advantage of being surrounded in front and behind. (3) The southern part of Yu Tang only relies on the Shanghai-Minhang Road for land transportation. Although Beihui and Beitang Roads surround it in the rear, they are separated by a river in Yu Tang and the town of Beiqiao. After all, it is not as close to the northern part of Yu Tang. Moreover, the hub of land transportation in the county should be north of Yu Tang and not south of Yu Tang. The matter is obvious. It can be known by referring to the plan already set by the Construction Bureau and can be seen by the completed Beihui Road. It seems inappropriate to give up what is near and seek what is far. (B) The location of the county seat should take into account the future development in all aspects. The location of the county seat is the center of gravity of the entire county. The future development should be considered in many ways. If the study is not conducted carefully and considerations are not made carefully, then a millimeter difference may result in a mile error. Now, let us discuss the theory of learning, the facts, the topography, and the trend of development, respectively. What to go and what to follow should have a theorem. (1) In terms of learning theory, geographers say that the south of a mountain is yang, the north of a mountain is yin, the north of water is yang, and the south of water is yin. Therefore, for all kinds of buildings, the south is taken instead of the north in the mountains, and the north is taken instead of the south in the water. Taking these meanings into account, the construction of the new county seat seems to be more suitable in the north of Yu Tang. (2) In terms of factual theory, the locations of each town in this county are all north of each main river, such as the towns of Tangbei and Ma being north of Yu Tang, the town of Zhuanqiao being north of Liulei Tang, the towns of Chenhang, Tangkou, and Tiqiao being north of Zhoupu Tang, and the town of Sanlin being north of Sanlin Tang. That is to say, the development of Minhang Town has not begun without facing the Huangpu River. Based on the facts, the construction of the new county in this county should be north of Yu Tang, which is undoubtedly the case. (3) In terms of topography, the southern part of Yu Tang itself is flat, but the area is not wide. On the east and west sides, rural areas are dense, and there are many graves, with many obstacles. Moreover, the terrain is uneven, making development difficult. Moreover, the town of Beiqiao is blocking it from the rear. Even if efforts are made to build it, it is feared that it will be more important in the southwest and lighter in the northeast, forming a malformed situation. On the other hand, the northern part of Yu Tang has an open terrain and a wide area. For example, if it is opened up in the east and west of Hengjing, the area is no less than a dozen square miles. The site is much wider than the south, and the location is moderate. Once the new rule is observed, the towns of Minma, Beizhuancaotang are located in the front, back, left, and right, like the stars supporting the moon. The scale is grand and the momentum is magnificent. (4) In terms of development trends, Shanghai is a prosperous area in the country and a world-renowned place. Therefore, the facilities for water, land, and air transportation in various places are tending towards Shanghai. According to Premier Sun Yat-sen's plan for a greater Shanghai, the county area is within the city, and the county and the city belong to the same family. At this time, it is advisable to strive to be close to the urban area and become increasingly prosperous. Not only should the end point of the roads in this county be concentrated in the city, but also the development trend of the new county seat area should tend towards the city. Now that the county area is located in the southwest of the city, the county seat should focus on the development of the northeast, so as to seek common progress. There is no doubt that shifting the location of the county seat to the south and west versus shifting it to the north and east has been weighed its advantages and disadvantages, and the general conclusion can be seen. The above points only concern the actual situation of water and land transportation in the county and the trend of future development. The northern part of Yu Tang is closer to the center. The location of the county seat is better to be as close to the center as possible. To control the whole county, it should be close to the center. To protect the local areas, it should be close to the center. To connect each district, it should be close to the center. To seek overall development, it should be close to the center. In short, the terrain of the entire county is flat, with no high mountains or ridges, and no long rivers. The situation is not particularly special, and the obstacles can be said to be extremely few. There is little difference between the north and south of Yu Tang. This convenience is not necessarily the strength of the other. The obstruction of the latter is not necessarily the shortcoming of the former. Based on the survey of the topography and the observation of the four borders, a detailed study should be made in the balance and comparison. Is it appropriate to pray for your public review?</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Issue for the Two Railways</h3>
<p>Hope for Issuance Remains</p>
<p>Regarding the payment of the year-end bonuses for the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways for the 19th year of the Republic, after repeated requests to pay half a month's salary, the Ministry of Railways has not yet approved it. Previously, it had been approved with an instruction to not discuss it. However, the workers in the machinery, electricity, and engineering departments of the railway, seeing that several days had passed and no clear order had been issued, and the workers were eager to receive the payment to pay their debts, re-elected representatives on the other day (the 13th) to petition Director Liu and express the workers' difficulties. After repeated negotiations, Director Liu finally agreed to pay the workers' portion first, while the staff's portion would be decided by the Ministry's order.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Allocates 20% of Official Land Sales to Education</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Orders Zhejiang Provincial Government to Comply</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of proceeds from the sale of official land to fund education. The Yuan ordered the Ministries of Education, Finance, and Interior to review the matter. Last month, representatives from the three ministries held a meeting at the Ministry of Education. The resulting proposal stipulated that 20% of the proceeds from the sale of official land in the province be allocated to education. The proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan issued an order approving the proposal. The original order stated, "The submitted proposal has been reviewed and approved. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is hereby ordered to comply. This order shall be notified immediately."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Closure of Nanyang Medical College</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, citing the complex student unrest at the Shanghai Private Nanyang Medical College, has ordered the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to close the college. The students are to undergo a screening process organized by the Municipal Education Bureau and teachers recommended by the college. The Ministry of Education's orders are recorded below.</p>
<p>Order to National Central University: Regarding the investigation into the mismanagement of the Shanghai Private Nanyang Medical College, the Ministry has already ordered the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to shut down the college. According to the Ministry's regulations for handling closed or suspended private schools, "For schools that have been ordered to close or suspend operations, the person responsible for the closure of the school shall submit a roster of students and photographs to the local education authorities for screening and issuance of certificates of completion based on their performance." Since the Private Nanyang Medical College has been ordered to close, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau should organize a screening committee to conduct the screening. The selection of committee members must be done in collaboration with several teachers recommended by the college's medical school. In addition to ordering the Bureau to make direct contact, this order is to instruct the college to promptly relay these instructions to the medical school for compliance. This is the order.</p>
<p>Order to Shanghai Education Bureau: The student unrest at the Shanghai Private Nanyang Medical College is complex. The college previously submitted a request to temporarily suspend operations, which the Bureau was instructed to investigate and handle. A report was subsequently received stating, "The college president, Wu Zongqing, has been absent from the college for a long time, and the chief trustee and other trustees are mostly not in Shanghai, leaving no one responsible. The college's board of trustees previously submitted a request to 'take responsibility for handling' the situation, but to date, the semester has begun, and they have still not taken responsibility for handling it, allowing the school to stagnate and the students to run wild, which is highly inappropriate. Furthermore, the school's buildings are rented, the classrooms are very cramped, and the equipment, books, and specimens are too simple. The affiliated hospital is especially rudimentary. The college has no auditorium and does not hold commemorative weeks. The courses on Party doctrine and military training are merely nominal and have not been effectively taught, which is a violation of regulations." Given the current state of the college, which has fallen into such disrepair, it should be immediately shut down to avoid misleading young people. The Bureau Director is hereby ordered to investigate and handle the situation in accordance with the Ministry's Instruction No. 205 of the previous year regarding the handling of closed or suspended private schools and report the situation for record. In addition to ordering the National Central University to forward these instructions to the college's medical school for compliance, you are to contact them directly and promptly organize a screening committee to begin work as soon as possible. This is of utmost importance. This is the order.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association's Game Yesterday: Laoda Defeats Huadong</h3>
<p>| Nanyang Tiger King Xiliang Joins Huadong |</p>
<p>36 to 32</p>
<p>| Results of Four Games</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held a total of four games last night. The most noteworthy was the Huadong vs. Laoda game, as Wang Xiliang, one of the famous Nankai Five Tigers and a defender, recently transferred to Shanghai and joined Huadong. However, Huadong still lost to Laoda by four points, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Results of Yesterday's Games | A Total of Four Games</p>
<p>Feifei Wins Guangyi (Group B) 40-12</p>
<p>Mailin Wins Pao Dui (Group A) 45-30</p>
<p>Laoda Wins Huadong (Group A) 36-34</p>
<p>(Blank) Dui Wins Quanhei (Group B) 28-18</p>
<p>Huadong Suffers a Crushing Defeat | Laoda's Performance Deserves Attention |</p>
<p>Wang Xiliang's joining Huadong is no less than adding a new force. As a famous general, his demeanor and skill are outstanding. Unfortunately, Huadong's forwards are relatively weak and lack cooperation, leading to their defeat by Laoda. Looking back at Laoda, they are full of spirit and their shooting is extremely accurate, so Huadong suffered their deadly blows. After the start of the game, Laoda consistently gained the upper hand. Huadong only managed to add two points when the score was 16-15. Huadong was ahead by four points in the first half. In the second half, Laoda scored twelve points in one go, leading 28-20. Huadong desperately caught up, making the score 24-32, but unfortunately, Laoda scored another point from a free throw, extinguishing all hope. The final score was 36-34.</p>

<h3>Japanese Schoolchildren Show Great Improvement in Physique</h3>
<p>Height and Weight Increase Significantly Compared to 30 Years Ago</p>
<p>Due to Changes in Living Conditions, Etc.</p>
<p>Tokyo News: According to statistics from the Tokyo Municipal Education Bureau, the physique of Japanese elementary school students has improved greatly in the past 30 years, due to factors such as exercise, changes in living conditions, the use of chairs in classrooms, and the adoption of Western-style clothing. In 1900, the average height of 7-year-old boys was 3 feet 6.7 inches, and the average height of girls was 3 feet 6.1 inches. By last year, the figures had increased as follows: boys to 3 feet 7.4 inches, girls to 3 feet 6.7 inches. The improvement in stature is even more significant for 12-year-old students, who have been in school for 5 years. In 1900, the average height of boys was 4 feet 3.3 inches, and the average height of girls was 4 feet 3.5 inches. By last year, the figures had increased to 4 feet 4.8 inches for boys and 4 feet 4.1 inches for girls. The weight of 12-year-old boys and girls has also increased significantly compared to 30 years ago. Only chest circumference is less developed, it is said.</p>

<p>Continuous snow, the swift scene urges people. The countryside road is far away, the heart of the traveler is sad and desolate. Helplessly freezing the brush, writing down my troubles, thinking of the stories in the snow. Most of the worldly known ones are quite interesting, I pick a few and write them down. I give the reader an emotion of thinking about the past, and relieve the cold feelings of the times. Perhaps it will also be a conversation filler for those seeking wine around the fireplace.</p>
<p>Ode to Snow: The snow scene is a natural poetic material. There are countless beautiful verses about snow from ancient times. But the most famous one is probably the daughter of the Xie family. In the "Shishuo Xinyu", Great Tutor Xie gathered his family in the inner courtyard on a cold snowy day and recited to the snow. "What does the swirling white snow resemble?" His nephew, Hu'er, said, "It's like sprinkling salt in the sky." The young daughter, Daoyun, said, "It's not as good as willow catkins rising in the wind." The Duke praised her highly. One sentence then overwhelmed thousands of years, and it came from a young girl. It is true talent. I once composed a line about this event, saying, "Heaven teaches pearls and jade to be transmitted from a fair mouth, a clever person writes their own ice heart."</p>
<p>Reflecting Snow: "Yiwen Leiju" says that Sun Kang was poor and could not afford lamp oil on winter nights. He often used the reflected snow to read. This is a good model for scholars throughout the ages. Today, the electric lights in people's rooms are bright as paintings, and books are stored high on shelves. Isn't that a great waste of the good evening lights and shadows? There is more than enough shame in the quilt shadows.</p>
<p>Sleeping in the Snow: "Biographies of High-Minded Men" says that Jiao Xian slept in the snow because his thatched hut was burned down. But it is not as interesting as the story of Yuan An. In Luoyang, a heavy snow accumulated more than ten feet deep. The guards arrived at An's door but saw no one traveling, and thought An was dead. They removed the snow and entered the house, and saw An lying stiffly. They asked why he did not come out. An said, "In heavy snow, everyone is hungry. It is not proper to bother people." The official thought him wise and recommended him to the country as honest and upright. The official was also wise. If one were like An in today's world, they would only freeze and starve to death. I, Cai Jiaotong, once wrote a poem about it, saying, "I don't believe the cold power invades iron bones, a lot of spring feeling accompanies the plum blossom." Cai was also a poor scholar, so his poem is empathetic and insightful.</p>
<p>Boiling Snow: Snow boiled into tea is the purest in taste. The water is completely free from contamination. In the past, Scholar Tao bought a concubine from the house of Taiwei Dang. When it snowed, he ordered her to take snow and boil tea. He then said to her, "The Dang family must not know this." The concubine said, "They are vulgar people who can only sing lightly in gilded tents and drink lamb wine." I say, how refined is this concubine! In these snowy days, the wealthy people in Shanghai are all like Taiwei Dang. Fortunately, none of them have concubines like the Dang concubine, so they are just enjoying themselves and do not encounter ridicule.</p>
<h3>Climbing Guhua Mountain in the Snow</h3>
<p>by He Tianjian</p>
<p>For days the snow has been falling and the ground is covered with over two feet of snow. Dwelling in a low house, I suddenly have the desire to climb a mountain. In the midst of the snow, I decide to ascend Guhua Mountain and test a distant view. Can others avoid laughing at me for being a fool? First, I drive to the foot of the mountain. Looking back at the fields, they are all a white, boundless expanse. Looking up at the peaks, they are adorned with silver and jade. White clouds enveloped them, making it seem as if they lead to heaven. The pine and fir trees obscured the branches and leaves, becoming a mound of jewels. It was a marvelous sight that I have never seen before in my life. At that moment, birds and people were nowhere to be found. I only felt that nature was connected to me. I put on my shoes and climbed up, like snowflakes fighting with me, encouraging my courage. I braved and went straight in, not stopping. It is also one of my records of conquering nature. At first, the path was slightly visible, but after passing the foothills, it became confusing and difficult to discern. Thinking that there must be footprints where I passed, I thought I could return without fear. So I continued straight up, without any hesitation. After several stumbles, I realized that the snow was wavy and the bottom must be a dangerous rock. If it was flat and spread like soft cotton, the bottom must be a depression or flat ground. With this lesson, I turned danger into safety and finally reached the mountainside. My mind was slightly settled, I spread my eyes to look into the distance. I did not expect that the magical scenery that had shocked me just now, was no longer magical. It was like the River God overlooking the ocean and not knowing what to do. What was presented to my eyes was like chaos before creation, how could I discern the city walls and mountains. I saw only a vast expanse of white, it was difficult to know if my body was in a sea of white clouds. At this time, the wind was especially tight and the snow was even denser. The clouds were even lower. Looking down at the path from which I came, even the footprints were gone. I was greatly shocked. How was I to return? The place where I was located was in the most dangerous area. Just as I was in a critical moment, I suddenly heard chuckling in my ears. The sound seemed to be coming from the gorge in the western mountain. I saw two or three young girls dressed in blue cloth clothes, looking like students. They were also unable to find their way out because the snow had submerged the mountain path. I asked them if there was a path to find where the stream flowed. They said that there was when they came, but now it was all submerged by the snow. They beckoned me to join them. Alas, the scenery was strange and the encounter was even stranger. I didn't expect that there were others here who were as curious as I was. I considered joining them, but then I thought that there were no people in the empty mountain, and men and women were inconvenient. So I said to them, "I will go down first, you can follow my footprints to avoid danger." So I ventured down and reached the plain. Looking back at them, they were also hesitating and following behind me. This is a strange encounter. How can I not record it?</p>
<h3>Record of a Groundbreaking Ceremony in the Snow</h3>
<p>Cheng, Zhi, Zheng</p>
<p>The Engineering Building of Jiaotong University: Since breaking ground, construction has progressed rapidly. On the 14th, the university held a special groundbreaking ceremony. Hundreds of people attended, including Minister of Railways Sun Zhesheng and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi. Many notable things happened, and a few are selected below for the readers.</p>
<p>A Silver World Carved from Jade Dust: The day coincided with heavy snowfall, with snow accumulating over a foot deep on the ground. The entire Jiaotong University turned into a silver world. Around 10 a.m., guests began to arrive in succession, their cars winding like long mosquitoes. The scene of people getting in and out of the cars was also a spectacle. It was truly a grand event within a grand event.</p>
<p>Minister Sun's Earnest Remarks: At 10 a.m., a meeting was held in the first classroom, chaired by President Li Zhaohuan. Minister Sun gave a speech, wearing a leather overcoat. His demeanor during the speech was extremely composed, and his words were very sincere. Minister Sun said that the expansion plan of the university was very large, and the engineering building was only one part of its implementation. The university could be considered satisfactory in spirit and history, but material conditions also needed to advance simultaneously. At present, the country and society have a great need for construction talent, and the responsibility lies entirely with the university. He hoped that everyone would concentrate on studying after the completion of the engineering building, so as not to fail the country, and so on. His pronunciation was clear and his language appropriate, moving all who listened.</p>
<p>Attending the Ceremony in the Snow: After the meeting, the chairman invited all the guests to the engineering building to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony. Chinese and Westerners alike braved the snow to set off, their clothes covered in silver. After arriving at the engineering building, the workers took out the foundation stone, which was placed by Minister Sun. The foundation stone was made of white marble. Minister Sun caressed it for a long time. At the same time, the sound of firecrackers and military music rang out, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Interesting Photography: After the ceremony, a group photo was taken. Wang Shengshan, Dean of the College of Mechanical Engineering, loudly told the foreign guests, "Come quickly and join this interesting photograph! Such a snowy scene is rare!" Everyone smiled and rushed to take the picture.</p>
<p>The Japanese Chargé d'Affaires' Leisurely Air: Among the guests was the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Shigemitsu Aoi. After watching the ceremony, he slowly walked out of the main building. At that time, the car was parked on the road. The Chargé d'Affaires calmly braved the snow to get into the car. Li Zhaohuan also stood upright in the snow, taking off his hat to see him off. Shigemitsu repeatedly nodded in the car.</p>
<h3>Notes on Trivial Matters in the Heavy Snow</h3>
<p>Sun, Chou, Cheng</p>
<p>From midnight on the 13th to noon on the 14th, large snowflakes, as big as goose palms, flew in Shanghai. I, being fond of traveling, took this opportunity to wander around the Bund and climb to the roof of the Oriental Hotel to enjoy the snow. I hereby record the scenes I saw as follows.</p>
<p>Sweeping the Tracks: This morning, there was a lot of accumulated snow. It was untouched by people, pure white, and lovely. The streetcar tracks were covered with snow. The drivers were afraid that it would be difficult to follow them or that they would derail. Therefore, the company dispatched workers early in the morning to sweep the tracks separately. At 6 a.m., I stood at the entrance of Jiu'an Lane and saw more than ten workers on Zhengfeng Street, each holding an iron shovel, clearing the snow and sweeping the tracks with brooms. They worked in shifts, not afraid of the freezing weather. I especially admire the holiness of labor.</p>
<p>Fat Copper Statues: At about 7 a.m., I arrived at the Bund and looked out at Pudong from afar. The tiled roofs were all white. Looking down at the Huangpu River, the ships were covered with snow. The magnificent buildings suddenly turned into a silver world. Four or five Western children were chasing each other at the entrance of the park, dressed in short clothes and leather shoes, full of energy. Looking back at the copper statues standing on the Bund, they were covered with several inches of snow, looking like they were made of plaster, much fatter than usual. It's a pity that I didn't bring a camera, otherwise, this kind of snow scene would be a rare sight in Shanghai and should be captured on film to commemorate it.</p>
<p>Competing to Avoid Cars: After 10 a.m., there were more and more pedestrians. The snow accumulated on the road was trampled and turned into mud. The wheels of the cars were buried a few inches deep. When driving, they stirred up the mud, and the water splashed everywhere, which was quite a sight to see. However, pedestrians on the sidewalks on both sides, if affected, would have their clothes soiled all over. Therefore, they all competed to avoid them. Occasionally, someone would fall because they could not avoid it, shouting that they were unlucky.</p>
<p>Nowhere to Hide: On Xizang Road, there was a young woman riding in a rickshaw from north to south. The rickshaw puller accidentally lost his footing, and the rickshaw overturned, causing the woman to fall into the snow, covered in mud. She repeatedly tried to get up but kept falling because the high-heeled leather shoes slipped easily. The rickshaw puller knew that he had caused trouble and fled, pulling the rickshaw away. Then, a young man in a suit helped her up. All the pedestrians were watching, causing the woman's face to turn red, and she had nowhere to hide.</p>
<h3>Record of a British Stamp Collector Winning the Championship</h3>
<p>Ji, Qin</p>
<p>Westerners often collect ancient stamps as playthings. A small piece of paper can be worth more than ten thousand gold pieces. The older it is, the more precious it becomes. It is valued for its scarcity. The value in this is arbitrarily set, and each person has their own preferences. According to a recent Berlin dispatch, the International Stamp Exhibition was held here in the early part of this month. The gold medal for first place was won by a British man named Simms. It is said that Simms owns no less than a hundred kinds of stamps. The most famous is the one-cent stamp issued by Guiana from 1726 to 1748. Its color is light yellow, with a薇flower border on the top. In the blank space in the middle is a drawing of St. Andrew, which is incomparably fine. If you measure it with a microscope of several hundred times magnification, the eyebrows and whiskers are all visible, and they are all raised. There is a fingerprint on the forehead, which is the point of distinguishing authenticity. It is estimated that each one is now worth 15,000 British gold coins. Simms only has two or three of them. In addition, stamps such as the Scottish Golden Eagle stamp and the Canadian whole 棻stamp, although rare, are not only different in age but also in value compared to the Guiana stamp. Once assessed, it is appropriate that he alone wins the championship. Before the meeting, someone was willing to pay double its value to find it. The threshold was like a marketplace, but he refused to see them. His wife advised him that seeking vanity was not as good as gaining practical benefits, etc. He actually left in a huff and hid in London for three months. He did not dare to show his face until the meeting. How strange!</p>
<h3>Brief Notes from Zhabei</h3>
<p>Xiu</p>
<p>Recently, on various roads, rain or shine, day and night, there are often two or three Japanese monks, wearing gray cloth robes, the style of which is similar to our country's monks. They mutter to themselves and beat drums, walking past in a humble and quick manner, not at all like beggars. Those who see them are puzzled. This is also something worth studying.</p>
<p>Since Liu Rongtai died heroically, Chen Shaoji has been publicly elected to take over the position of voluntary director of the third section fire brigade. Chen is a fat man with extraordinary strength. It is said that in a certain disaster, he once carried a heavy iron safe weighing hundreds of pounds from the upstairs of a neighboring house that was affected by the fire, descending quickly down the ladder. He is so strong and powerful! This is worth a lot of praise. (Gratitude)</p>
<h3>Tales of Paris</h3>
<p>(2) (1) (1) 6 Sent from Paris</p>
<p>Nagova said that he was from the island of Ceylon, not India. Ceylon and India are separate. There are very few Chinese people there, only a few families. In ancient times, it was called the Lion Kingdom and was the place where Hinayana Buddhism flourished. There is Pangu's Tomb and Adam's Bridge, which is said to be where Adam and Eve lived in ancient times. Later, they were expelled by God and passed over this bridge. Then, is the ancient site of the Garden of Eden in Ceylon? Did mankind originate here? I asked Nago. Nago also did not dare to assert that his family was descended from the ancestors of mankind, but said that there were still many wild elephants and many strange plants. Ceylon can be regarded as a park for scholars of zoology and botany around the world. If you pass through the southern tip of India to travel to Europe, you can go to Ceylon for a visit. Master Daojie said that the five-colored Buddha statues in Ceylon are very beautiful, and the jade Buddha statues in Nepal are even more beautiful than those in Myanmar. If you buy a complete set of Buddha statues in Ceylon, it will cost 200 yuan. If you travel from Myanmar to India to visit the Buddhist sites, it will also cost 100 to 200 yuan to visit everywhere because the cost of living in India is lower than in Yangon. But you should not go to visit the Buddhist sites during the rainy season because transportation is inconvenient.</p>
<p>On the 6th, Mr. Zhou Guangzan invited me to the YMCA recreation meeting, which was held after 6 p.m. It was set up for 建people, which shows the deep intentions of foreigners spreading their religion. They are professionally classified and responsible for each part of our country. The first performance was the egg-blowing game. A grid was drawn on the ground, and adults or children were asked to lie on the ground and blow the egg forward. The first one to roll to its circle line wins. Those who were willing lay on the ground waiting to be blown. A man lay on the ground, and a woman called out the instructions. I silently thought that this kind of trick was only suitable for stupid males. If it were an elegant woman, she would definitely not do it. This proves that the great difference between the work of the two sexes can be judged from the game. The second was a 力game. A group of men went through the hoop. As a result, they exerted themselves and collided with each other. A group of people laughed and made fun. Using a sexual analysis, this is only suitable for male actions. As a result, there was a kind of game in which men and women cooperated, which was to send letters by calling names. Two rows were lined up, one row of men and one row of women, so that men and women could exchange positions, trying to create an opportunity for the two sexes to have contact in the midst of the busyness. It can be seen that in a group where the two sexes cooperate, the female will be harmonious and will not move around randomly. If it is purely male, there will definitely be a big fight. This example can be universally observed in all male games.</p>
<p>On the 7th, Taiping Association was formed, and Indians also joined and composed poems of praise.</p>
<p>On the 8th, Mr. Qiu from the Dutch colony came to talk about his own experience of being a teacher, then becoming a merchant and making a fortune, and then engaging in sports. Even if he shared his property with others, he would not be able to transform society. He once used 10,000 yuan to work with several people to test the theory of communism. As a result, people falsely accused him of not being his property. From this, it can be known that it is difficult for human nature to be communist. I thought that Toerstedt had said that human beings can not only be saved by giving them money, but that both materialism and idealism are related. Mr. Qiu himself scattered his wealth and worked hard to test his gains, which can be called a practical report. However, I deeply examined the mistakes of Western theories. Rousseau advocated equality based on emotion. In fact, people's measure varies greatly. Therefore, Marx tried hard to realize its equality. The conclusion must be that everything is public. The nineteenth-century Marx is like the eighteenth-century Rousseau. However, the social problem is still difficult to solve in the end. The wise go too far, and the foolish do not reach it. The Middle Way is difficult to achieve. Is the Oriental Datong's way of fairness better than equality?</p>

<h3>Frequent Ups and Downs in the Gold Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Fluctuations of 54.5 Taels: Last week's bullion market was extremely volatile. The wild fluctuations were difficult to suppress. It was not uncommon to see fluctuations of several to ten taels, and there were generally twenty taels of variations each day. Stirring up trouble, it was fickle and unpredictable. In the end, the trend was still upward. On Tuesday, a record high of 791 taels was reached (only the black market had ever reached 94 taels after a year). The lowest price on Thursday was 736.5 taels. Afterwards, the high point was seen again. The difference during this week was 54 taels and 5 mace. Comparing to the previous week, it still rose by 7 taels and 8 mace, but the industry lost its resolve, making it difficult to cope. This was really due to the divergent fluctuations in overseas silver markets and Shanghai exchange rates, especially the confusing news, which caused the market to drift with the wind. The near-term big bar silver market was mostly flat, while the far-term market contracted slightly by 0.0625. The US silver market contracted by 0.375, while the British exchange rate listed price contracted by 3.5 points (0.625). The Japanese exchange rate rose by more than 8 points. The British exchange rate has broken into the 2-pence range, and a new era has emerged. On Saturday, it was the date for the gold exchange rollover. Because the 16th was the date for the year-end settlement, it was held two days in advance. The bulls still posted around 7 taels. The maximum was 8 taels, but it was privately done the day before (the 13th), with 6-7 taels. The minimum was 5 taels and 7-8 mace. This is because there is currently an excess of cash, so the shorts are raising the price. The initial price for April was 782 taels, which was higher than in March. According to the settlement price of the Japanese exchange rate, the bullion market was pressed down by 70-80 taels. The path for red bar silver was normal, and the prices for each period all increased by more than 4 taels. The overview of the past six days is recorded below.</p>
<p>A New Record Was Found: From Monday, the big bar silver market did not change, and the silver price contracted by 0.375. Almost as soon as the March bullion market opened, it rose by 6 taels and 7 mace, reaching 773 taels. Afterwards, there were still more buyers, and the exchange rate listing contracted by 1 point, so it rose to 788.5 taels. The market became tighter, and the prior order was repeatedly reduced by 1 point. It soared by 10 taels. The afternoon closing reached 89 taels, a sharp increase of 22 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous Saturday. After the closing, it suddenly broke through the 90 taels mark, reaching 94 taels. Taikang, Runyuan, Xingyong, etc. followed. There were 17 changes that day, but the exchange did not accept the accounts, and all the 90-tael accounts were handled by the firms themselves. The next day, the big bar silver market rebounded by 0.125, the silver price did not change, and the prior order did not rise or fall. However, there was loosening internally, and most firms sold out. The gold market initially fell by 7 taels, reaching 82 taels. Later, due to sales by Fuchang and Yuanheng, it only reached 74 taels. Again, the buyers were active, and it rose above 80 taels, reaching 87 taels. It fell back 4-5 taels at noon. In the afternoon, the storm was raging. Initially, the Indian exchange rate was reported to be small, reaching a new record of 91 taels. In an instant, the Indian exchange rate rebounded, and the Shanghai market also loosened. Moreover, the sellers in the market were surging, suddenly breaking the 70-tael mark, reaching 69 taels. The closing price was 71.5 taels, a decrease of 17.5 taels compared to the previous day. There were 22 taels of fluctuations that day, which was a case of prosperity turning into decline. On Wednesday, the big bar rebounded by 0.3125, the US silver price increased by 0.075, and the prior order rebounded by 1.5 points. Both the explicit and implicit markets loosened. The decline in the gold market intensified, plummeting by 20 taels, with 16-17 taels of variations throughout the day. It had already plunged by 11.5 taels as soon as it opened in the morning, reaching 60 taels, followed by 51.5 taels. The prior order rose by 0.375, and the internal market strengthened in a flash. Moreover, large firms bought in, soaring above 10 taels, reaching 63 taels. The noon closing rebounded to 55.5 mace. In the afternoon, it broke into the 50-tael mark, reaching 47 taels. Yuancheng and Xinxing sold, and the Indian exchange rate was reported to have risen several times, rebounding by 7-8 taels. Taikang, Runyuan, Xingyong, etc. followed, and the closing price was 51 taels, a decrease of 20 taels and 5 mace compared to the previous day. The next day, the big bar increased sharply by 0.4375, the silver price increased by 0.075, and the exchange rate initially increased by 0.375, and then changed twice, totaling 0.25, which was still an increase of 0.125. The internal market loosened and then strengthened. The gold market initially depreciated by 8.5 taels, reaching 42.5 taels. Because the US was buying at a listing price increase of 0.0625, the European market hardened, and people became nervous. Then it fell to 36.5 taels. Later, the prior order had already contracted, and the buyers were still active, and it had risen above 50 taels, soaring by more than 10 taels, reaching 59 taels. The prior order then contracted by 0.125, and the sellers seemed to be more numerous, falling by 6-7 taels. The closing price rose again to 56 taels, an increase of 5 taels compared to the previous day. However, the waves were turbulent that day, with 22-23 taels of twists and turns, but there were no huge transactions. The next day, the big bar suddenly contracted by 0.3125, the silver price had no market, and the prior order contracted a total of 3 times, totaling 0.625. The internal market was also tense, so the rise in the gold market was even more intense. The early morning was flat, reaching 56.5 taels, slightly increasing by 5 mace. Afterwards, there were quite a few twists and turns, from 57.5 taels to 59.5 taels. It was a difference in the funds of each firm. Afterwards, it stepped on the blue sky, soaring by more than 10 taels. It reached 82 taels in the afternoon. The prior order was changed 3 times by 0.375. Hengxing, Shengda, etc. sold out in an instant, the wind rose and the clouds surged, pouring down 11-12 taels, reaching 70.05 taels. The confusion of the market situation was extreme. The closing price was 75 taels, a continuation of the previous day's increase of 19 taels. In one day, there were 32-33 taels of fluctuations, which were rarely seen. The big bar was again lower by 0.3125 on Saturday, the silver price was reduced by 1.5 points, but the buyers in the European market were not idle, and the US initially released slightly, but afterwards there was no intention to sell, so the Shanghai exchange rate did not change, and the internal market seemed to be loosening. The gold market opened slightly softer, down 3 mace, at 74.7 taels. However, it was the date for the rollover, and April was on the market. There were no ins and outs in March. The closing price was 74.1 taels, slightly less 9 mace compared to the previous day, and there were also 9.7 taels of differences between the high and low prices. The initial price for April was 82 taels, followed by 88 taels. Yuanheng, Hengxing, etc. sold out, falling to 77.5 taels. Afterwards, the buyers were endless, and it had broken out beyond 80 taels. The noon closing was 81.1 taels, also with 10.05 taels of variations. The rollover was 7-8 taels, which the shorts were posting. There were still some firms that had not finished rolling over. The amount of red bar silver increased due to the rollover, so the price fell back by 2-3 taels compared to the bullion price. The highest and lowest prices of the British, American, Indian silver markets, and exchange rates are listed below.</p>

<h3>The Major Year-End Settlement Situation of the Silver and Money Industries Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the traditional custom of the lunar calendar's small New Year's Eve, and today is the major New Year's Eve. All accounts for the 19th year must be completely closed. Therefore, the situation was unusually busy. However, according to the results of the loan transactions of the silver and money industries, most of them used yesterday as the year-end settlement. Although the banks happened to be closed on Sunday, they made a special exception to operate as usual because it was the year-end settlement period. Except for the foreign banks that remained closed, all Chinese banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank, operated as usual. However, the Chinese accounting departments of the foreign banks (commonly known as the comprador offices) also accepted the receipt and closing of accounts as usual. All kinds of receipt and closing items, regardless of which item, were all closed out, causing the foreign firms to have a large short squeeze. The price of foreign cents soared. It was because of this that the money houses, which originally planned to be closed today (the 16th), made special arrangements to be open as usual due to the banks' request.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Rose Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>The Strength of the Bulls Was Majestic</p>
<p>Future Changes Are Still Great</p>
<p>The yarn market had a rising trend at the beginning of the week. The exchange rate was difficult to loosen, and the situation of overseas cotton yarn was expected to turn around. Foreign cotton was hit by the exchange rate, and the calculated price of the silver disk was very expensive. Therefore, the local cotton market was extremely turbulent, and the yarn market, which was closely related, was difficult to decline. The buyers' attitude was strong, and the sellers knew that after the backbone of the Chaozhou gang failed, the strength of the retail investors was very weak. Therefore, the bullish momentum in the market was even stronger. On Monday, in the four markets before noon, the price rose sharply by more than 4 taels. The shorts could not cover their positions in time. With the two sides at a standstill, the brokers convened an emergency meeting and decided to increase the special margin for new purchases in the exchange by 20 taels per lot. Afterwards, some maintained their selling positions, and the situation eased slightly. Due to the exchange being closed for several days on the weekend, the price of gold rose again, and the retail shorts covered their positions, making the rising trend even more intense. However, the actual sales were even more deserted and lifeless. Due to the year-end settlement, a total of 1,725 bales were purchased by various guest gangs throughout the week, and 665 bales were traded within the industry. The prices rose by 4-5 taels. Some manufacturers traded out of the standard yarn market on the weekend, but the rising trend was still strong. In short, the raw materials are expensive. When the market opens in the spring, there are fears that drastic changes will occur. A total of 147,150 bales were traded throughout the week. The prices of standard yarn for each month rose by more than 6 taels for the near months and more than 4 taels for the distant months compared to the previous week. The amount of spot yarn purchased by each gang is recorded below.</p>
<p>Gang Package Number Gang Package Number Yunnan 190</p>
<p>Tianjin 355 Guangdong 225 Within the Industry 665</p>
<p>Inland 775 Hong Kong 140 Shantou 80</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Rose Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>The Exchange Rate Did Not Loosen, and Foreign Cotton Was Difficult to Integrate</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Madly Absorbed and Many Agreed</p>
<p>The intensity of the rising trend in the cotton market last week was rare in history, resembling the panic of the cotton shortage era. This situation was completely hit by the exchange rate. The price of gold was difficult to lower, making it impossible to calculate the price of foreign cotton on the silver disk. Japanese merchants absorbed a large amount in the futures market and spread the news. Many of the general agreeers also belonged to this camp. After the failure of the Chaozhou gang, the strength of the shorts was very weak, and the spot goods in Shanghai were low. People had a good mindset, and new sellers were nowhere to be seen. They were all afraid to act rashly in the face of the emergency situation. Therefore, the market price continued to rise, and the prices of standard cotton for each month rose by 2-3 taels compared to the previous week. A total of 376,400 dan were traded throughout the week. The source of goods at the docks totaled 1,130 bales of Yaohua and 1,800 bales of Tonghua. Manufacturers purchased 15,640 dan, and foreign firms imported 2,000 dan. American cotton rose by 50 pounds of sound. The amount purchased by each manufacturer and foreign firm is recorded below.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Weakens, English and Indian Cotton Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to buying by peers, but later weakened due to rain and profit-taking by bulls. Spot prices fell by 3 to 8 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. English cotton futures rose 23 points, spot prices rose 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 15 points. Indian cotton strengthened and rose due to purchases by European exporters and brokers. Broach (Brocach) for near and far terms rose 6 rupees. Oomra for near terms rose 6 rupees, and for far terms rose 5 rupees. White Broach (White Broach) rose 7 rupees, and for far terms rose 6 rupees. Originally from Amritsar, (14th telegram).</p>

<h3>American Cotton Rose Intermittently Last Week</h3>
<p>New York, 13th Telegram reports on raw cotton for the week: Last week, the cotton market continued to rise due to gradual improvement in business and reduced cotton fields. Europeans were more optimistic, so foreign merchants purchased. Domestic purchases and short covering also occurred simultaneously, and speculative demand also increased. The firmness of securities proves that business is expected to improve. A small number of spot supplies and profit-taking in March contracts were absorbed, but when May prices reached 11 cents or more, demand weakened, fearing that prices were too high, which might affect actual positions and reduce planting problems. The Central Cotton Belt has received timely rain, but it is still considered insufficient. Planting arrangements are progressing very well. Attached are weekend statistics as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative listings this season 12,816 11,291</p>
<p>Cumulative factory use since August 1 48,69 3,109</p>
<p>And cumulative exports 5,218 4,745</p>
<p>To Japan 763 88</p>
<p>To China 131 242</p>
<p>To England 1,047 845</p>
<p>To Germany 1,394 1,221</p>
<p>New York inventory 98 228</p>
<p>Inventory in various ports and towns 3,598 5,619</p>
<p>Worldwide supply 8,088 10,356</p>
<p>Of which, American cotton 5,395 7,856</p>
<p>Worldwide use of American cotton since August 1 9,175 6,484</p>
<h3>Research on the Price of Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>Indian cotton fibers are shorter and of lower quality compared to American cotton, which is generally recognized. Although Indian cotton cannot directly compete with American cotton, it is important to remember that when the price difference between American and Indian cotton exceeds a certain limit, consumption will shift between them. This is especially evident in the consumption of Indian cotton in Japan and the relatively low consumption of American cotton domestically. In general, Indian cotton prices rise and fall with American cotton prices, but in part, it can be said that Indian cotton is more influenced by incalculable domestic consumption and external silver price relationships than American cotton. Expected Indian cotton price data can be analyzed and obtained as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Cotton Season Carryover New Cotton Total Supply Consumption Average Price During Cotton Season (Pence per Pound)</p>
<p>White Broach Oomra American Middling</p>
<p>1925-26 1,250 6,100 7,750 6,508 9.56 8.97 10.77</p>
<p>1926-27 1,975 5,650 7,625 5,608 7.33 7.18 8.1</p>
<p>1927-28 1,875 6,250 8,125 5,658 9.88 9.21 11.17 1928-29 2,500 6,050 8,550 6,585 8.92 8.03 10.52</p>
<p>1929-30 2,225 6,685 8,910 6,680 7.05 6.39 9.09</p>
<p>1930-31 2,120 6,200 8,320 6,000 6.75 5.00 7.0</p>
<p>The predicted average price during the cotton season will be revised with changes in gold prices or various wholesale price standards. Accurate prediction of Indian cotton may not be more difficult than American cotton, but the method adopted by the Indian government for publishing cotton production reports only allows obtaining total supply statistics after the cotton season has passed. For example, the first forecast of Indian cotton production for 1930-31, indicating 14,875,000 acres of cotton fields, does not mention middle cotton land, which would allow estimating the final output, but only publishes the reports received at a certain time. This method is not satisfactory, so it is impossible to obtain accurate details about cotton. Now, let's study exports, factory sales, and hand spinning consumption, and list them as follows:</p>
<p>(2) Supply and Distribution of Indian Cotton Production (Unit: Thousand Bales of 400 Pounds)</p>
<p>1929-30 1928-29 1927-28 1926-27 1925-26</p>
<p>Government Cotton Production Estimate 5,260 5,811 5,571 6,025 6,250</p>
<p>External Exports 3,934 3,940 3,195 2,857 3,775</p>
<p>Indian Factory Sales 2,396 1,895 1,713 2,001 1,983</p>
<p>Hand Spinning, etc. Sales 350 50 750 750 750</p>
<p>Total 6,680 6,585 5,658 5,608 6,508</p>
<p>Indian Inventory at the End of August 1,170 1,165 1,700 1,100 1,050</p>
<p>Estimated Actual Cotton Production 6,685 6,050 6,250 5,650 6,500</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation, Indian cotton consumption has greatly increased compared to other cotton, and the price difference between American cotton and Egyptian cotton on Indian cotton has also decreased considerably. In 1928-29, the average price of American cotton was 4 cents higher per pound than Indian cotton, but it has now been reduced to 2 cents. (Agricultural)</p>
<h3>Coal and Briquette Sales are Particularly Brisk</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the retail business of coal shops in this port has been unusually lively, especially the sales of briquettes, which are the most popular. The total sales each day are about 1,000 tons. White coal sales are also smooth, and prices are very firm. Liujiang white coal is sold for 28 yuan per ton. However, lower-grade goods such as Hongqi pellets and Mark pellets are very sluggish, because many sand casting and copper making factories in this port have stopped work. A large number of coal varieties, such as Western-style residences and hotels, in this port are also buying in large quantities, so the store's wharf trucks are quite busy.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Zhejiang White Factories Ship Ten Packages to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Silk factories in various places in Zhejiang, such as Shihutang, etc., are now shipping their stored silk to Shanghai because the settlement period has arrived and they need funds for turnover. The other day, factories such as Wei Chengtang, Li Dalun, Jiaxing Yujia, and Huzhou Model in Hangyuan together loaded 80 packages of various brands of white factory silk.</p>

<h3>The Bicentennial of Daniel Defoe's Death</h3>
<p>Daniel Defoe, the author of "Robinson Crusoe," his name is very common. Almost everyone who has read this book knows the name Defoe. This year marks the bicentennial of his death, and commemorative events are being held around the world. The grandeur of the occasion is truly rare. Defoe is often called the "father of the modern novel." He was a Londoner, born at the end of the 17th century. His father, James Foe, worked as a butcher in St. Giles Cripplegate. He later changed his name, and his son had not yet reached middle age at that time.</p>
<p>Initially, young Daniel wanted to become a dissenting minister. He also excelled in school, but he eventually changed his ambition. After leaving school, he engaged in commerce and worked in a hosiery shop for a year or two. Later, he became fascinated with writing and wrote a poem that was greatly appreciated by King William, who summoned him to an audience and gave him a lot of money. However, after Queen Anne ascended the throne, his favor declined because he wrote a pamphlet about dissent. The book was disliked by both dissenters and Anglicans. The House of Commons therefore severely ordered all copies of the book to be burned and offered a reward of 50 pounds for Defoe's arrest. Not long after, Defoe was indeed arrested. In addition to a fine, he was also sentenced to the pillory. However, his punishment turned into his glory, because the public had a very good impression of him and decorated the pillory with flowers, making him a hero worshiped by everyone. However, Defoe considered himself to be bankrupt for the second time. After calculating, he lost 3,500 pounds because of this lawsuit. So, while in Newgate Prison, Defoe published a weekly review attacking the government. Later, after he was released from prison, the government gave him a position.</p>
<p>He was sent to Scotland to advocate for the union of the Scottish and English Parliaments. However, he was imprisoned again because of his political activities. In 1719, Defoe published the first volume of "Robinson Crusoe," which perfected the art of writing novels. Initially, readers of his works believed that the events described in the book were all true. In fact, most of it was imaginary, although much of the material was taken from a sailor named Alexander Selkirk, who had survived a shipwreck. Defoe received many honors because of "Robinson Crusoe" and wrote two more books about his feelings, but neither became famous.</p>
<h3>Shanghai New Art Exhibition of the Nineteenth Year</h3>
<p>The National Art Exhibition, held on Guohuo Road in Shanghai in the spring of the eighteenth year, once caused a sensation among many people in the art world and was also a factual need. It was not a grand art exhibition just for decoration. However, until December of the nineteenth year, there was no second appearance, which is really a sign of the decline of the Chinese art world. Although the Chinese new art world has only a thirty-year history, it is still inevitably ridiculed for having no special progress, at least on the surface. Of course, there are many reasons for the decline of the new art world, such as the hypocrisy of education, the shallowness of writers, and the selling of "wild man's heads" by students returning from abroad, and other reasons. At the same time, scholars often go astray, resulting in the depression of today's new art world. This is indeed the case, and we cannot hide it.</p>
<p>The art exhibitions this year are still considered lively. I have visited a total of eighteen, which averages to one and a half times a month. Conversely, there are always three new art exhibitions in two months. I cannot describe the various aspects of each exhibition in detail, but only record its date and location. From the following table, you can see a section of the current situation of the Shanghai new art world last year.</p>
<p>1. Hangzhou 18 Art Society Exhibition, January 2-4 / Ningbo Fellow Association</p>
<p>2. KITCHIGINS (Russian) Solo Exhibition, February 8-16 / Museum,</p>
<p>3. White Goose Painting Exhibition, February 22-26 / Changchun Road,</p>
<p>4. Wang Jiyuan's Leaving Country Exhibition, March 10-14 / Ningbo Fellow Association,</p>
<p>5. Kiichi Nakagawa (Japanese) Solo Exhibition, March 26-27 / Japanese Club,</p>
<p>6. Southern Society Painting Exhibition, March 28-31 / Upstairs of Paris Grand Theater,</p>
<p>7. SHANGHAIARTCLUB Painting Exhibition, June 3-15 / 3 Jiujiang Road,</p>
<p>8. Guan Zilan's Solo Exhibition, June 13-16 / 4th Floor of Hua'an,</p>
<p>9. Noboru Hasegawa (Japanese) Solo Exhibition / June 17-18 / Japanese Club,</p>
<p>10. People's Art Exhibition, June 20-30 / Yimiao Inner Garden,</p>
<p>11. China Academy of Art Achievement Exhibition, July? / This School,</p>
<p>12. White Goose Painting Exhibition, July 6-8 / Changchun Road,</p>
<p>13. Shanghai Art College Achievement Exhibition, July? / This School,</p>
<p>14. Changfeng Painting Society Exhibition, August 20-22 / Huanlong Road,</p>
<p>15. Shanghai Art College Achievement Exhibition, November 21-23 / This School,</p>
<p>16. Wang Yamo and Rong Junli's European Exhibition, December 5-21 / Zhongshe,</p>
<p>17. Shanghai Art College Achievement Exhibition, December 11-13 / This School,</p>
<p>18. Xinhua Art College Achievement Exhibition, December 18-21 / This School,</p>
<p>If the Shanghai art scene has regular progress, then art exhibitions will definitely increase in quality and quantity in the twentieth year. (Zhang Yuanji)</p>

<h3>Talking About the White Goose Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Lou Jin</p>
<p>The fifth White Goose practice exhibition opened on January 31st. (January 31st) I saw all the works on the morning of the 31st. The impressions and feelings left are now written below.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Sitong has a "Noon in a Desolate City". For those who have painted outdoor sketches, I think when he faced the ancient Chinese city walls, he was very hesitant to think, how can I paint the most appropriate and beautiful look? Because these ancient city walls are too large, lack change, and are very difficult to handle. But this "Noon in a Desolate City" is an exception. It is very admirable for the author to be able to have such a result in dealing with painting materials. "Noon in a Desolate City" gives the viewer the ancient city walls surrounded by the strong yellow light of the setting sun, which makes us feel disgusted with the works of those who paint red Western-style buildings and yachts. It seems that this ancient gray city wall is unusually suitable for us, intimate, allowing us a lot of meditation and nostalgia.</p>
<p>Chen Qiucao's "Lonely Lamp" and "Summer on Changchun Road" use a special brushstroke to give us a refreshing, beautiful, and hazy feeling.</p>
<p>Again, Fang Xuehan's "Nude Woman 1" is a very large work. It is not easy to complete such a large painting, which is admirable. Dou Leiou's "Painting Liu Tongxia" uses a red female costume painted in vermilion, abandoning the superficial taste of the general style in recent times, exposing the creativity behind the skilled technique.</p>
<p>From the existing art groups in China, the White Goose seems to be running in a different direction, and it also has its shortcomings and strengths. I think their advantage lies in facing the canvas and changing the object according to their own ideas to make the object conform to the conditions they consider beautiful. Therefore, their paintings have very unified brushstrokes, cleanliness, and harmonious tones. For one thing, one person, they all solve them very clearly, without any messy, ambiguous places. In short, it gives the viewer a simple and clear feeling. This is their strength, but sometimes they deviate too much from the object, lacking the color and contour that the object gives to human beings. This is very unfortunate. This is my opinion, and I think the members of the White Goose will not be offended.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>The Story of a Newspaper Reporter</h3>
<p>Tang Zeng Yang</p>
<p>Written by Huang Tianpeng</p>
<p>The Chinese journalism community has recently seen a sudden boom in the past year or two. Many books on journalism theory have also contributed to the journalistic world, and most of these monographs belong to the precise and powerful category. They are definitely not like those so-called literary books published in the Chinese literary world, which are mostly rough and shoddy products. At the same time, they do not have a correct central idea, but only make the general readers grasp a vague impression and a deformed consciousness, which undoubtedly creates a crisis in the reading world. Therefore, such a large amount of production in the literary world is not a good phenomenon worthy of praise. The current journalism community is very different. For example, "Chinese Journalism," "Introduction to Journalism," and other collections of papers are all essential reading for scholars studying journalism. The correctness of its argumentation and the precision of its content can be compared with those monographs on journalism published in the journalistic world of developed foreign journalism. At the same time, this kind of journalism monograph seen in China has a uniform thought. Although it cannot be said that it is a correct central idea, at least it can be said that there is no other bad consciousness infiltrated in it. This is indeed a point worthy of praise in the new literary world, and most of these monographs with uniform thought are written by Mr. Huang Tianpeng, which is even more great.</p>
<p>While introducing monographs on journalism theory, Mr. Huang focuses on making books of journalism descriptions. Not long ago, he published a "Tianlu Talking About Newspapers," whose anecdotes in the journalistic world are truly interesting and timeless, and in this talking about newspapers, we can get extremely rich basic knowledge of newspapers, truly coming at hand, all becoming beautiful pieces of writing. The latest book, "The Story of a Newspaper Reporter," is very interesting.</p>
