<p>時評</p>
<h3>鎭靜與準備</h3>
<p>最近日政府以我國抗日運動之日益擴大。日益深刻。受打擊益大。極呈恐慌。乃進一步實施其暴力恫嚇。一面向我政府提出覺書警告。一面更派遣大隊軍艦開來。分佈我沿江各埠。其欲以砲艦政策刦持我政府我國民。進止抗暴自救之不合作運動。俯首帖耳順受其蹂躙與宰割。蓋爲天下人所共見。</p>
<p>國人於此時機。絶不應表示驚惶與怯弱。應嚴整步武堅定自持。應有最後之準備。應下最後之决心。所謂不應表示驚惶與怯弱者何。日砲艦近日雖陸續開來。但吾人未必遂信其於此中外雜處世界注目之區域。竟有何種冐天下之大不韙之暴舉。即彼昏迷不醒。不能自制。竟將有以一逞。則九一九之恥辱。可一而不可再。爲維護我國家之人格。保持我民族之光榮。我承受五千年古國文化薰陶敎育之國民。於此最後之時機。應知所以自處。應知有以自衞。若不加深思。彼尚未動。我先惶急。不可終朝。或且搬家遷室。另覓樂土。則我國我土。我家我室。尚不容我安居。怯弱與無抵抗之最後。我民族甯能得一片安樂土。以爲老死之所耶。怯弱驚惶。甯其有益。所謂應嚴整步武。堅定自持者何。日人即有「一逞」之野心。但亦必得一可以藉口之口實。日來日軍在各地之演習示威。即其蓄意挑釁之明證。吾人於此。則應堅壁清野。不輕舉妄動。忍受小忿。避免不必要之犧牲。務使彼瘋狂之徒。即欲肆虐。亦無法可以藉口。若日人竟將炸毁满鐵事件之栽誣手段。移用於上海或其他各地。則禍變臨頭。避將安適。以熱血維護正氣。以生命維護祖國。當仁不讓見義勇爲。吾國民應亦知所以自决。總之日艦之來。其最大目的。爲欲以恫嚇手段制止我之不合作運動。國人須認清對日不合作運動。爲我國民自衞自救最後僅存之武器。我爲自衞自救。而與人不通往來。不通貿易。我有絶對自由。絶無受人干涉之餘地。故國人於此應下最後之决心。手中所持僅存之武器。今後更應堅持到底。决不爲任何恫嚇。任何暴力所屈服。印度國家雖亡。而其精神猶足以照耀世界者。則以其國人能持不合作主義。堅决奮鬥之故。我國今日如併此不合作運動。亦不能繼續。最後僅存之武器。亦爲人所繳去。則我所失者。不僅爲「不合作運動。」立國之精神。亦同時掃地無餘矣。</p>
<p>所謂下最後之决心。作最後之準備者。即準備犧牲。準備以血洗血。國人應認定爲正義與公理而犧牲。自有其永遠不磨之光榮。</p>
<p>吾人相信黑暗終當毁滅於光明。魔鬼終當陳屍於公理與正義之足下。吾人復何憂。更復奚懼。</p>

<h3>法國草地會發表世界網球十傑</h3>
<p>法台杯隊長之意見</p>
<p>（巴黎通訊）法國草地網球會會長傑洛氏發表本年世界網球選手前十名如下、</p>
<p>（一）柯顯脱（法）　（二）凡恩士（美）</p>
<p>（三）奥斯汀（英）　（四）希爾士（美）</p>
<p>（五）白里（英）　（六）鮑羅屈拉（法）</p>
<p>（七）洛德（美）　（八）杜愛格　（美）</p>
<p>（九）伍　特（美）　（十）佐藤次郎（日）</p>
<p>傑氏係法國台維斯杯隊隊長（不參加比賽者）、所見自高人一等、對於奧斯汀與白里之位置、法國輿論頗不一致、有置白里於第三名而奧斯汀第五者、但傑洛氏之意見則如次、奧斯汀在英美台杯帶際决賽時、白里大敗於希爾士、法錦標選手鮑羅屈拉亦曾敗於希、而奧則戰勝之、温布登複賽時、奧已佔勝勢、敗於不幸耳、白里則在巴黎在紐約浦脱二次勝伍特、在紐亦勝洛德范令二次、惟在法國網球大會敗於提史蒂芬尼、在温布登敗於伍特、在台杯賽敗於希爾士、故其位置不能再高也、</p>
<h3>暨南兩運動選手病况</h3>

<h3>羣英會丨大戰西捕</h3>
<p>丨邱中鋒技藝超羣丨</p>
<p>馬來亞隊選手整齊、技能出衆、華僑之羣英大會也、大戰西捕、五對四勝、優勝劣敗、事所當然、前鋒五人中、邱永源中鋒最爲出色、頭頂脚踢、跑快傳速、無以復加、左内關順德左翼李文傑精於合作、善於射擊逢隙必停、進必有所爲、右内阮國英亦能力盡厥職、右翼陳美安、原非正角、表演略弱、中衞綫鄧約翰蔡文禮活躍非凡、進而接濟、退而防守、莫不可觀、徐亞輝輕捷可取、惟不能止對方活根生之活動、老將余煒華名重一時、身手依然、靈巧不足、堅硬有餘、可以敵鐵漢透納有餘、秦元連八面威風、大有姜太公在此百無禁忌之概、守門劉金榮瑜瑕並見、然亦第一流人物也、</p>
<p>鄧亞發</p>
<p>蔡文禮　李文傑</p>
<p>秦元連　關順德</p>
<p>劉金榮　鄧約翰　邱永源</p>
<p>余焯華（領隊）　阮國英</p>
<p>徐亞輝　陳美安</p>
<p>强遇强丨冠軍失敗</p>
<p>丨開塲時聲勢喧赫丨</p>
<p>七十分鐘大戰、西捕在開場十五分鐘内、聲勢喧赫、横掃直擊、目無餘子、二分鐘間、破關得彩、左右環攻、繼續不止、十五鐘後形勢驟變、往往來來、工力相等、迨至下半時、全軍精疲力盡、土崩再解、受人控制、門柱有靈、爲其解圍者數次、否則當有較距離之比數也、活根生爲全隊最危險人物、守門表演亦甚佳、所失五球、除第四球外、其餘非渠之過、此外各人成績尚佳、然入後咸不及初時之堅硬、失敗之故在此、如果場地乾燥、兩隊當有更佳成績、</p>
<p>赫雷　活根生</p>
<p>史谷德　透納</p>
<p>勃雷萊　軋許（隊長）阿達姆</p>
<p>史蒂華　傑克</p>
<p>吉勃生　喔克萊</p>
<p>一對零丨開塲失勢</p>
<p>丨活根生一脚成功丨</p>
<p>兩軍齊至、但候裁判員發令、臨時不得其人、久而久之、幹事周家騏自告奮勇、出球服務、馬來開球、轉入敵手、幾至敵方利用任意球、迫得角球透納一頂、球落前後二衞之中、活根生如得神助、提起一脚、直攻龍門、竟而中的、一對零之比數、乃於二分鐘内造成</p>
<p>一對一丨隊長立功</p>
<p>丨馬來亞生氣勃然丨</p>
<p>西捕勝得一球、加緊工作、一時風雲變色、形勢惡劣、馬來前鋒雖不時進展每半途中止、迨十五分後、否極泰來、内衞整固、前鋒得力、西捕門前、累呈惡化、一次中的越位不算、阮隊長得左翼傳球、頂入門中、比數遂成一對一、</p>
<p>二對一丨透納獲球</p>
<p>丨上半時西捕占先丨</p>
<p>嗣後馬來繼續進攻力盡人事不中、天數也、邱中鋒前鋒巨劈、技術似在上海戴麟經香港、馮景祥之上、軋許對之、無法可施、二次匹馬奪關、功虧一簣、又一次左右翼連射、門柱作梗、徒呼奈何、良好情勢之下、透納偶然奪得一球、一脚提起、滾入網中、上半時西捕二對一占先、</p>
<p>二對二丨全塲一驚</p>
<p>丨二分鐘内顯本領丨</p>
<p>下半時、邱中鋒浩浩蕩蕩、率領全軍、遍野而來、球自中至左左翼挑中、守門扑地救之、不得、球横過門前、右内阮國英順脚一踢、痛飲黄龍、二分鐘内、頓成二二和數、全塲爲之一驚、</p>
<p>三對二丨馬來反身</p>
<p>丨邱中鋒頭技誠佳丨</p>
<p>西捕一度活動、活根生又乘機攻門、内部空虚、幸而守門挽救有方、脱離危險、大難不死、必有有福、果然十分鐘内、馬來不絶攻擊之下、突然邱中鋒飛奔前進、由右再中、邱中鋒一頂入門、清切美麗、誠不易也、三對二、馬來從此反身矣、</p>
<p>三對三丨西捕又起</p>
<p>丨百忙中内部空虚丨</p>
<p>馬來左翼李文傑受傷、出塲休戰實力减色、活根生又告活動、守門托向後方、邱中鋒巧避數人、傳球中央、左内關順德打中門柱、大大不幸、百忙之中、馬來内部空虚、三四傳遞、西捕傑克趕上踢中、二隊比數、又告三三平數矣、</p>
<p>馬來亞足球隊（本館攝）○領隊余焯華　隊長阮國英</p>
<p>五對三丨馬來連捷</p>
<p>丨十分鐘内勝二球丨</p>
<p>此後十分鐘内、馬來連捷、獲得二球、勝局遂定、二球中之第一球、由阮國英撥入、得力於右翼陳美安之接濟、第二球咎在西捕守門之慌忙、一球在握、竟隨手抛去、邱中鋒坐收其利、而以五對三領前、</p>
<p>五對四丨功成身歸</p>
<p>丨慰勞宴會遊全市丨</p>
<p>西捕確屬可畏、在惡劣環境中、奮鬥不已、稍一大决、利用角球、又被活根生破關而入、最後結果、五對四、馬來得勝、當晩七時、協進會在金陵酒樓舉行慰勞宴、宴畢、全隊游覽全市、</p>
<p>中華隊丨約期明日</p>
<p>丨請看雙方鬥實力丨</p>
<p>準備參加全運會之上海中華隊、亦以全運會中止、致不能一顯身手、不勝遺憾、今適逢馬來回國、乃約於明日下午三時、與馬來會師於棒球塲二隊在全運會中、均有奪標希望、故明日之戰、不啻如奪全國之錦標也、</p>
<p>十三日丨暨南挑戰</p>
<p>丨馬來之最後一役丨</p>
<p>昨日賽後余衡之會同馬來領隊余焯華及暨南體育主任陳掌諤隊長江善敬、幹事郝春德等、互相議定十三日與暨南隊比賽、是爲馬來在滬之最後一役、十四晨即啟程赴杭、</p>

<h3>熊式輝之談話</h3>
<p>熊司令抵滬、已誌昨報、聞熊在京甚忙、因日來滬上謡諑蠭起、特回滬一行、本擬昨晩返京、因得中央電囑、多留數日、故未成行、熊昨晨六時、即往司令部辦公、聞明日將召集職員訓話、蓋恐各職員以中央因廣東問題、令陳銘樞兼代淞滬警備司令、致惰厥職云、熊昨對各記者談話、特爲紀錄如次、</p>
<p>數日來上海謡諑甚多、閘北日僑及中國人民、紛紛遷居、日僑恐中國人襲擊、中國人又恐日軍襲擊、彼此之不相安、完全出於誤會、中國人之愛國運動、是遵守紀律者、决不至對普通日僑、有何舉動、故日僑儘可安心、上海與瀋陽情形不同、日本亦不至以對待瀋陽者對待上海、奈有人故意造謡、如本日某西報所載、日領曾函張市長云、中國政府力量不能保護日僑、彼將自行派兵保護等語、張市長未接此項函件、此余所知、該西報所言、殊屬可笑、余相信在滬日僑、中國地方政府、已聲明負責保護、决無意外、日艦數艘到滬、在日本則云爲安慰日僑而來、然因此引起中國人之反感、但如果日本欲攻取淞滬、彼未必信現在之兵力已組有餘裕、故上海决無意外之事發生、可斷言也云、</p>
<h3>張羣昨晩赴京</h3>
<p>向蔣報告滬地情况</p>
<p>上海市長張羣、於昨日下午三時十五分、乘中快車赴京、向蔣主席報告滬地治安情形、聞張氏在京勾留一二日、即行返滬</p>
<h3>日兵故意張皇</h3>
<p>國人當採正當防衞</p>
<p>國聞社云、前日（六日）本埠忽起謡傳、致江灣各學校學生、咸由家長代請假離校、一時空氣甚爲緊張、而閘北一帶居民、更以以訛傳訛、紛紛遷徙租界、至晩間謡言尤盛、但聞此次謡言、實由日海軍在北四川路西北各越界築路地方、設置武裝崗兵、使市民觀之、致起恐慌、亦一鉅因也、</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>矧該處早經我政府收回、雖有在十分緊張時、准設崗保護僑民、但最近本埠並無對日僑有何不利之事發生、則彼遇事驚慌、入晩、在附近密布陸戰隊士兵、致華人引起不安、昨聞公安局已呈市府、向彼交涉、免因此而發生誤會、但至昨晩、謡言似稍息、已不若前日嚴重矣、</p>
<p>廣東中小學師生抗日救國會來函云、昨今兩日、傳聞日本有預備佔領南北兩市之說、風聲鶴唳、人心惶惶、大有草木皆兵之概、遷移搬物者、大不乏人、或謂此係一種謡言、不足爲慮、果爾、不成事實、固所願也、惟日人狡猾多詐、安能保其必無、證諸此次瀋陽、彼方列隊佈防、安置電網、猶宣言謂爲防盜、此種舉動、吾人不可不有所深慮、否則一旦變生倉卒、吾人將手足無措、一任蹂躪矣、本埠負責諸公其亦有所計及之乎、不然南北兩市、又將斷送於鎭靜無抵抗五字之下矣、吾以爲守土治民、正當防衞、决不可少、弱國雖無公理、然絶對不能以我之自衞表示、而遂謂爲對敵之標準也、吾以爲本埠民政兩方、須從速設法自衞、一面由政府負責、向中外宣佈自衞方針、日人果無異動之表示、吾人决可保日僑在華界之治安、如日人有若何舉動、吾人誓當採取正當之防衞、如是則不至禍起須臾而束手待斃、亦不至彼方藉爲口實矣、願羣起注意及之、未始非防患未然之一法也、</p>
<p>克銀漢費信惇要求日領</p>
<h3>注意租界治安</h3>
<p>日方允不使形勢擴大</p>
<p>惟要求限制抗日運動</p>
<p>此次日本調兵艦來滬、各界人士、發生驚慌、雖係愚人自擾、與一班好事者造謡所致、然連日日水兵之種種示威行動、以及日本派人之散布謡言等等、實不無令人注意之點、蓋此次日艦來滬、全係旅滬日僑之傲慢要求、彼等自滬上反日愛國運動發生後、幾無日不窮思極慮、終日密議於蓬路日人俱樂部中、本埠公共租界工部局對此、已早加注意、前日、自淞滬警備司令熊式輝氏來滬、與張市長等集議治安事宜後、同時工部局總裁費信惇、亦召集中外各董集議此事、結果、即於昨日由費總裁商由領團領袖美總領事克銀漢、向日領要求、請注意全滬治安、並告以住在華界之日人生命財産、完全由華方負責保護、租界内由工部局担負、勸日方勿自驚擾、以利治安、聞日方對此、已允盡力約束、决不使形勢擴大、惟對華人抗日愛國運動、則要求租界當局、加以取締、對華界亦請克費二氏、向我當局轉請加以限制、是以上海治安可保完全無慮云、</p>
<p>外報紀</p>
<h3>工部局態度</h3>
<p>盡力維持租界治安</p>
<p>中日爭端嚴守中立</p>
<p>大美晩報云、本埠日文報曾詆責公共租界工部局對於扣留日貨、不加禁阻、前據可靠消息、日文報紙之責言、實無根據、工部局對於此次中日爭端、必須嚴守中立、不能袒護任何方面、工部局之責任、乃在保護租界内居民之生命財産、而不問其屬何國籍、工部局現正竭力盡此責任、至於扣留日貨情事、迄今未有所聞、或者有一二無關重要細微之扣留事件、○</p>
<p>但須知租界地面甚廣、凡日貨出售、或存儲之處、工部局不能一一派巡捕守衞也、目下中日居民之人心、激昻達於極度工部局自黨嚴守中立、隨時維持治安秩序、</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。自暴日突據東北。不宣而戰。我國無抵無抗。不戰而退。屈指算來。忽忽已二十天了。國際聨盟雖照會暴日撤兵。但是他們的兵依然未撤。反又佔營口。佔牛莊。更以戰艦示威海上。一步一步的緊逼上來。我國方面。除了熱心愛國的學生與商人。奔走號呼宣傳救國外。仍然是一籌莫展。我們手無斧柯的民衆。惟有以沉毅果敢的態度。應付這艱難困苦的時局。一致的請求當局取消不抵抗主義奮發大無畏精神。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>新舊中國之軍師</h3>
<p>中國旣是一個民主國，老百姓簡直是毫不客氣的該做起阿斗來。但是阿斗如果没有諸葛亮是會亡國的。我們的諸葛亮是誰？在那裏？我如果把他的名字宣布出來，大家必定要把肚子都笑痛。您說中國現在握有最高權威的軍師是誰？扶乩的，算命的，看相的，卜卦的，測字的，做奇門的，木頭菩薩面前之籖筒。大人先生依八字定出處。當權的看相貌用人。一位刑庭檢察官對我說：「他那副兇相是會殺人的。」一天，我路過一個測字攤，見着一位女學生在那裏占卦，我心裏說；「女學生也信做卦嗎。」好奇心呌我站住。那女學生說：「我有一個朋友好幾天没有來信，問問那一天有信來？」測字的說；「男朋友，女朋友？」女學生不好意思，（我很怨我自己在那兒做伊的眼中釘）只說；「隨便只要是個朋友就是了。」當三一八慘案發生的時候，執政府的官員有好幾位必定要先做個卦，才敢出席國務會議。老太婆是不必說了，婚姻，出行，疾病無不要請敎算命先生或泥塑木雕的菩薩。你總以爲强盜土匪是天不怕地不怕那知道他離了菩薩也不行。太保阿書做案之前必燒香求籖，吉則行，不吉則止。這件事引我聨想到李闖。李闖從張獻忠那裏逃出之後，又被賀人龍打敗，手下有個從前做過鐵匠的劉宗敏想投降，李闖知道了，和宗敏同坐在一個廟裏歎氣，說「人說我有做皇帝的福分，何不問問菩薩，吉則跟我，凶則拿我的頭去投降。」宗敏贊成，把刀插在腰上看，三次都是好卦。宗敏便殺兩個老婆仍舊跟李闖去。李闖便從此一直打到北京。中國現在的李闖還多着咧，劉宗敏又何嘗少了一些。總而言之一句話，舊中國的軍師是迷信老爺！在二十世紀之科學世界中奉迷信老爺做軍師之民族必歸天然淘汰。阿斗阿斗，四萬萬的阿斗！你必得把諸葛亮趕快請出來。諸葛亮是誰？三個牛皮匠，抵個諸葛亮，我們的三個牛皮匠是：（一）不貪錢的文官；（二）不怕死的武官：（三）手腦並用的散思先生（Science之譯音，即科學先生。）</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>法蘭西新流行的甘地鹽瓶印度民衆運動的領袖甘地氏。Gandhi對英作非武力抵抗。力爭解除鹽禁。許印度人民在海邊自由製鹽。名震世界。法京巴黎的某瓷器廠。爲崇拜英雄起見。特地製成一種甘地鹽瓶。以供餐時和味之用。這鹽瓶的全體。就是一個小小的甘地造像。仿照他平日蹲坐的樣子。蹲坐在那裏。而在頭部開了許多小孔。以便撤出鹽來。巴黎的士女。很喜歡用這花樣新鮮而又玲瓏精緻的小鹽瓶。因此銷數極好。有些人也許要誤會。以爲甘地因力爭解除鹽禁的關係。而遂將他的像製成鹽瓶。似乎含有開頑笑的意思。其實並無此意。西方人崇拜英雄。往往在那些小東西上表示出來。英法兩國近來確流行這種以政治人物爲點綴的五味瓶。即如英國大政治家包爾温氏。Baldwin也已由他本國的瓷器商人將他的像製成一個小酒　了</p>
<h3>對外態度之今昔談</h3>
<p>— 益君</p>
<p>東省爲日軍霸佔。迄今已二十日。言交涉則了無進步。長此以往。國將不國。吾中央政府。對此嚴重問題。不識將如何善其後也。今之人每謂满清外交之軟弱。著著讓步。</p>
<p>顧予偶於舊册中檢得遜清庚子之役關於外交上諭一段。則當時雖亦知易行難。而較諸現在對外之態度。尚覺激昻多多也。爰摘錄其原文如次。</p>
<p>「光緒二十五年十月十九日奉上諭。現在時勢艱難。各國虎視耽耽。爭先入我室奥。以目下中國財力兵力而論。斷無釁自我開之理。惟是事變之來。實逼處此。萬一强敵憑陵。脅我以萬不能允之事。亦惟有理直氣壯。敵愾同仇。勝負情形。非可逆料。各省督撫。每遇中外交涉事件。往往預存一和字於胸中。遂至臨時毫無準備。此等錮習。實爲辜恩負國之尤。茲特嚴行申斥。嗣後遇萬不得已之事。非戰不能結局者。如業經宣戰。萬無即行議和之理。各省督撫必須同心協力。不分畛域。督飭將士。殺敵致果。和之一字。不但不可出諸口。並且不可存諸心。以中國地大物博。幅員數萬里。人丁數萬萬。苟能各矢忠君愛國之忱。又何强敵之可懼。正不必化干戈爲玉帛。專恃折衝樽俎。將此通諭知之。欽此。」</p>
<h3>古今書畫助賑會記</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>上海籌募各省水災急賑會婦女組虞澹涵唐冠玉兩女士發起徵集古今名人書畫助賑展覽會。籌備月餘。近始就緒。已定於本月九日至十一日假西藏路寗波同鄉會四樓開幕。聞該會先期發售書畫助賑券二百張。每張售價五十元。徵集當代收藏家鑒賞家及名書畫家捐助精品。並由虞唐兩女士出資精裱。每券一軸。十一日午後三時在會塲當衆抽籤取件。風聲所播。該券已銷售一空。昨在裝池處。偶見該會所裱現代各件。俱精妙絶倫。如張善孖之虎。大千之端午景。蕭厔泉之山水蘭石。王師子之睡蓮魚鳥。黄賓虹之山水。汪英賓之菊石。謝公展之柳蓮松菊。李祖韓秋君兄妹之山水。王个　之水仙蕉菊。屠格屠時姊妹之山水。張時敏之梅雀。馮超然之仿董山水。謝玉岑之篆書。馬萬里之楷杷葡萄·樓辛壺·汪聲遠·蕭佑生·王子原之山水。吳東邁馬公禺之法書。鄭曼青·馬孟容·張紅薇·徐瘦梅之花卉。均有獨到處。而鄭午昌之水墨四尺立軸。畫一菜一枯木。題筆如林。午昌自題云。霜青露白倍精神。水墨淋漓寫得眞。一紙要人輸十石。不知誰肯恤沉淪。深秋時節憶田園。不寫牡丹寫菜根。富貴浮雲人易老。好留清白與兒孫。謝公展題云。食盡菜根食樹皮。蒼生千萬盡流離。能將十石丹青買。福慧雙修不算痴。張善孖題云。枯木不成陰。浮雲何時滅。食菜如嘗膽。國恥方可雪。陸丹林題云。萬木枯。菜根絶。哀鴻嗷嗷。我心惻惻。謝玉岑題云。樹老餘生意。菘肥發晩香。眼前堪一飽。殘</p>
<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>裱糊匠</p>
<p>北都裱糊匠之藝。超於四遐。與棚匠殆相頡頏。若舍館初定。嫌其敝舊。唤裱糊匠以紙糊之則鮮潔奪目。朽腐悉化爲神奇矣。其藝之最神者。藻井楣桷。悉以色紙界之。儼如綵繪。天吳紫鳳。無迹可尋。邇來工價漸昻。每室須三四元。然以視圬漆之工。其廉遠甚也。相傳清廷需用裱匠。蘇州特送四人。初到即發出細腰葫蘆一枚。令裱其裏。一人沉思良久乃去蒂入盌鋒其中。令三人互摇之。使極光潔。然後用白棉紙水浸一宿。調匀灌入。即傾去。俟乾復灌。如是數次。然後進御。破之則徹襄有紙。而無補綴之痕。意此術自吳中傳至北都歟。前代都城所在。輒爲名工薈集之所。而其鄉里或反失傳也。凡糊屋以頂棚爲最難。屋之上以高梁稽爲架。稭倒繫於桁桷。以紙糊其下。謂之頂棚。不善裱者。輒者皺紋。北都糊匠决無是也。侈者則以漢瓦文紙。逐方排列。儼如藻井。近又有以棕簾爲頂者。亦頗雅潔。然裱糊之法。終不可久。鼠類窟穴其中。不數月輒穿敗。又手觸易汚。故一二年輒須一易。建築之術日新。此藝終須淘汰矣。</p>
<p>北方窗牖高大。其下一層多嵌玻璃。其上則糊高麗紙。以禦風沙。屆夏令則糊以綠色泠布。而以紙爲簾。覆於其上。隨時可以舒卷。狀旣雅潔。爲值亦廉。</p>
<p>墨是仁漿。王師子題云。洪水汎中國。人民痛析離。菜根何可得。萬樹早無皮。其餘如該會籌備員虞唐兩女士亦各有精美之作數幅。聞開會時不用門券。屆時參觀者之如潮湧。可想見也。（移酬助振）</p>
<h3>破天荒的新紀錄</h3>
<p>— 長天</p>
<p>運塲的百米短跑紀錄。現在最新的也要九秒多點。其進步之遲緩。眞正可想而知。然而回顧歐美各國用科學方法管理下的工業。則各種製造品。速率大增。幾乎樣樣能超過從前一半。人力之不能與機器競爭。在這裏又多得了一個證明。</p>
<p>在工作速率之進展中。最值得吾人之注意者。就是轟傳英倫的兩次製衣競賽。第一次是在里持Leeds地方。專爲蕭满書大臣所作。從羊身上剥下羊毛。直到全衣製成可以穿着之時。只須三小時又二十分半鐘。可是第二次。在米南司橋的哥老色公司裏。也同樣的做了一件衣服。以一小時又十分鐘打破了紀錄。那件衣服。是上午十點二十五分開始剥羊毛。在午飯以前。已經可以上身赴宴會了。</p>
<p>還有蕭满書大臣脚上穿的一雙皮鞋。據說也用這樣急就的方法製成的。從獸皮之剥取。以至全鞋完成。費時三十分又半。可是美國舊有紀錄。只有二十分鐘。相形之下。未免見絀了啊。</p>
<p>除開工業之外。急就製度。近已有人施之於農産物上面去。記得在一八九九年的當兒。英國潘明漢地方的卜老算君。以法用新鮮大麥。刈打磨粉。製成麵包。費時八小時。到了一九○六年。經苦心的研究。把時間又縮短至三小時半。然而在一九一一年的夏天。他又努力加鞭。預備打破他自己的紀錄。他在某地種了一些麥。到了是年八月七日的下午二時三十五分。就開始刈取。先用手打麥。再用機器磨粉。過了一小時四十二分。那麥粉和了酵質。就到了烘麵包的竈中。麵包烘好。爲時僅二小時又二十一分。紀錄於是又被打破。</p>
<p>又記得在一八七八年。有英國某工程師。用了急就制度。做過一座火車引擊。費時二十五小時又三十分。美國的本雪佛尼亞鐵路公司。聞此消息。大爲驚異。於是也依樣葫蘆的想跟他比一比。成績竟縮短至十七小時。然而隔了二十年。是一八九九年。英國的大東鐵道公司。爲掙英國人的面子起見。用了八十八個工人。也預備同樣的趕造一座。是年十二月十日上午九時零八分開工。只過了九小時四十七分。把那引擎全部告成。你想奇也不奇。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（八）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>裴時的理想是不錯的！在這世紀，英國人史蒂芬孫已發明了鐵道上駛行火車的方法；他和裴時的思想是一致的，眞應著古訓上說的丨北海南海有聖人出，此心同焉，的論調了。但是，史蒂芬孫生在英國，發明了機械工作，夠人崇拜，模仿，改進，和宣傳；裴時生在中國，發明了機械工作，只博得幾個呆漢，笨伯，壽頭，等類的徽號！</p>
<p>「裴時死了！裴時自縊而死了！」社會上人起先有這般驚異嗟歎的聲音。</p>
<p>「裴時的死，是可憐而不足惜的！」社會上又漸漸的變換著論調。</p>
<p>「裴老頭兒是不錯的，錯在裴遲；不死他，死誰？」社會上最後的論調，一致討伐那已死的裴時。</p>
<p>裴時因何而死？死於科舉制度之下！也是死於輿論制裁之下！也是死於家庭專制之下！也是死於反對科學思想者毒腕之下！東方的史蒂芬孫，就此曇花一現了！唉！</p>
<p>死的原因：！陶遲和裴時同去應試，陶遲考取了秀才，裴時却是榜上無名。秀才雖是小小的功名，但在十八世紀時代，爲著一句丨秀才是宰相的根苗，很博得社會上非常的重視；一經揭曉以後，得失旣分，當然笑啼並作。裴時一見了榜上無名，倒也没有什麽得失之心，考不中秀才，倒可以免却將來一切歲考和鄉試的麻煩。他一口氣跑回家裏，旁的不忙，忙在完成他的一輛小車會得在兩條鐵絲上自由往來的工作，因爲，這工作快要告成！誰料觸怒了裴老頭兒，觸怒了只在科舉題名錄裏翻筋斗的裴老頭兒；他見兒子考不中秀才，已經懊恨欲絶了；考不中秀才而依舊弄這奇技淫巧的頑意兒，違反他主觀的「不作無益害有益」的信條，這怒燄便蓬蓬勃勃的燒將起來了！把兒子打了一頓丨撲作敎刑的門閂兒，又把受著奇歧淫巧化的著作，究全付之一炬！又把待要完成的鐵絲上自由行駛的車輛·一一折斷打毁和消滅！罰令裴時從今以後除却高頭講事不許看，除却八股文章不許作！……可憐的裴時！便忍氣吞聲的自縊而死了！</p>

<p>又七日倫敦電、大條銀市不動、價與上日同、</p>
<h3>金融氣象逐漸平和</h3>
<p>昨日銀洋兩種市部、一致實現和緩、就表面上觀察、似無重大問題矣、洋厘市價、早市爲七錢二分四厘半、午市爲七錢二分五厘、較前日頓奸半厘、而買賣兩方、形勢尚無何種緊象可言、故逆料其無變化之可能耳、做出交易、匯劃票欵早市一百十七萬、午市一百五十一萬五千、鈔票早市七萬五千、午市六萬、塲外鈔票、早市十五萬午市九萬五千、銀行買賣、早市互市八十五萬、午市六十五萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百七十餘萬、鈔票進出二百餘萬、銀拆早午市同爲一錢七分、劃頭加水一錢左右、銀行掛牌七分、形勢回鬆、而拆票交易、尚未能復原、仍不過五六百萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千四百餘萬、洋公單收解六百三十餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解三百八十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百七十餘萬、拆借洋欵一百九十餘萬、各路匯欵收解一百三十餘萬、銀行收解、計華商收解票欵三百餘萬、外商收解票欵二百餘萬、各種貨匯税什諸欵八百五十六十萬、電匯欵四五十萬、特欵收解一百七八十萬、押欵交易七十餘萬、出倉四十萬、進倉五十萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、江南小洋早市爲六錢五分九厘、較前日改小一厘、午市同價、交易早市四千角、午千二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢五分二厘半、午市爲六錢五分二厘七毫半、交易早市十七萬五千角、午市三萬五千角、銅元改長一千文、爲三百七十五千文、</p>
<h3>長期押欵消息</h3>
<p>銀錢業對於本年上屆做開之六對月長期押欵、業已陸續相將到期、昨日已有百餘萬結束、其中照轉者、有七十餘萬、收回者有五六十萬、至於新做出已有接洽者、約計一百萬左右、對息價尚有斟酌、蓋目前銀拆低昻靡定之際、對此定期欵項之拆息當然有考慮之必要耳、</p>
<h3>證劵裁兵一九關復跌停拍</h3>
<p>餘亦跌甚鉅買方勢極沉靜</p>
<p>十一月期仍未開市况續清</p>
<p>昨證券交易所各債券市面情形、現貨全日概無交易、期市亦依然清閒、十一月期貨仍均未開出、日人進行暴力壓迫、巨艦陸續進窺我國中部、外交形勢、愈呈嚴重、故市上人心、咸較前益形虚弱、買方人氣之沉靜、爲久所未見、求供形勢懸殊、各債券於晨初開出即步跌頗勁、雖金融業方面略有收進、價終見盤旋益疲、計前市收盤時各債券多跌下二三元左右、下午統税鹽税以上午跌已鉅、勢尚穩和、其他則依然步跌、裁兵一九關遂以跌達限價停拍、餘如二○關捲統税鹽税一九善等、均跌近四元、編遺約小三元、整六關税亦跌一元五六角、蓋均下降甚鉅也、而由收市時以觀、則似稍穩定云、統計期貨交易全日共一千一百址八萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市買氣較盛</h3>
<p>紗市轉堅、趨勢又見漲、因外棉回漲、謡諑平靜、致人心安定、塲中買氣較熾、但現紗生意亦屬平淡、不過日廠或有停工之說、所以投機購進者頗不乏人、市况較昻矣、</p>
<p>人標上漲二兩　人標前市開盤、以外棉轉漲、市氣較緊、賣戶缺乏、各月漲一兩七·八錢至二兩一錢、午後近跌五錢、遠漲三錢、成交統計六萬一千四百包、查賣出同餘一千一百五十包、泰興二千七百包、義餘二千八百五十包、大昶二千包、天成一千包、泰昌一千包、益昶三千四百包、買進吉豐二千六百包、公泰三千包、榮興二千四百包、賡豐四千九百包、長豐三千九百包、兹將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市有劇烈反動</h3>
<p>棉市漲勢鋭利、因美棉上漲人心又緊、多頭購進加碼、且多數預料美棉有積極漲風、購買者更旺、然美棉生産較增、銷費未旺暢、所以大戶投機家逢漲仍抛空、且外棉差價、仍低八·九兩云、</p>
<p>漢標回漲一兩　交易所漢標前市開盤、以美棉上漲、且塲中市氣驟緊、各漲八·九錢、午後近月又漲二·三錢、遠月平、全日成交統計十八萬七千五百擔、查賣出梅記三千五百擔、振大三千七百擔、義成四千七百擔、裕大四千六百擔、信誠五千八百擔、長餘二千一百擔、買進吉豐六千八百擔、公泰六千一百擔、天隆三千六百擔、賡豐六千三百擔、義餘三千一百擔、兹將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市稍堅</h3>
<p>南頭　昨日常·錫·蘇·同破粳到十餘號、河積之貨、客方堅持、非達增價、决不出售、且照産區北㘮·平望等價格、合滬價相差達三角之譜、各號視此環境、兼之天氣不佳、銷化雖不旺、市形已轉堅硬、青角新洋杜尖·新粳祗見三筒、去路雖屬弱無神、價略見軟、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日來源不多、厚粳略有接抵、本客銷場見活、發米去路略有價提角許、新粳米破、本城店胃極淡、改低四五角、新洋蘆尖、茭白尖堅定、糯米早稻到頭亦夥、去路有限、價亦短一二角、</p>
<h3>洋米銷動轉機</h3>
<p>北帮續辦現貨</p>
<p>期貨有内地帮購買</p>
<p>洋米市况、因洋行抛售不已、各地銷化絶跡、市面步跌、似有一蹶不振之象、日來市上空氣甚劣、有預測小絞米須小至八九元者、但昨日洋行方面已不再抛、且各洋行均未接電續售、故新交易竸無只包交易、而現貨則有天津等北洋帮繼續裝辦、期貨又有内地帮問津、行情雖未拾級上升、但市面已帶活不少、全日開出一號西貢現米三百包、價十二元二角、小絞米一千餘包、價十元○六角至十元○三角、期米開出三月份八百噸、價五兩一錢半至五兩二錢半、十月份一百噸、價五兩○四分半、十一月份一百噸、價五兩一錢三分半、十月十一月之價略小、三月份五兩二錢半之價、較大八分云、</p>
<h3>粉麥午後大跌</h3>
<p>俄麥跌價求售　昨日小麥市况、因美麥頭批已在標賣餘額、二三批又不日到申、兼因俄麥跌價出售、來電祗三兩三錢、因此市上大爲震動、下午開市突起劇大變化、收市價本月份小八分、下月小一錢一分、十二月一錢三分、一月三月各小九分、二月份小一錢一分、現貨無市、後形看小、</p>
<p>麵粉反漲爲跌　昨日麵粉市况、被小麥影響、反漲爲跌、上午開市時因有北洋去路、空頭抵補、各月份均漲數厘至分半、下午期麥已見狂跌、廠家趁勢加多籌碼、更有新空與多頭競出、市面隨致下跌而無收拾景狀矣、最後收市近遠各小二三分、惟洋麥報價、則反漲有四五角云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白湧開四千袋</h3>
<p>抛貨成交亦盛</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價仍一·四三七五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·四○、明年三月份一·三六、比前電各升二分、五月份一·四○、比升一分、九月份一·四八、亦升二分、爪哇現期糖仍乏升沉、公會劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白交易仍寥陳貨白袋者十一兩三錢半至四錢、新貨十兩五錢、二十號中砂白十兩○九錢、綿荷白十二兩○五分、市均堅定、太古糖HM嘜十一兩七錢半、出戶殊乏、買氣頗暢、趨勢甚俏、嘜十二兩三錢、市則較平號盤有禎祥號售開陳貨粗砂白四千袋、價仍十一兩、市甚俏手、抛貨荷糖有南盛隆號售出十月及十一月份裝船陳担砂白三百噸、價荷幣五元五角半、大昌洋行售開十一十二月份裝船十六號中砂白五百噸、價五元三角、行方進意尚濃、如數售通、市形尚覺俏俐云、</p>
<h3>南北貨湘蓮白蓮均已回鬆</h3>
<p>湘蓮近以各方走場轉呆、市價前後回跌二三兩、漢市辦價亦已轉鬆、據函息、每砠價爲三十七兩至三十六兩六錢、此間現市衡州運售六十一二兩、常德蓮六十兩、甬廣兩帮採數均少、别帮僅零星而已、白連地價爲六十四元、申市售五十二三兩、廣帮略有交易、餘亦有限、市象平平、</p>
<h3>絲茶貢熙綠茶俄銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、俄國協助會洋行、對於婺源屯溪兩路之貢熙綠茶、又復開辦、白頭莊裕隆謙義等行、亦略有進胃、惟售價縮至四五十兩、較前見低三四兩、針眉秀眉綠茶、英莊行家、略有去路、市盤亦未能見佳、其餘珍眉蝦目等綠茶及祁寗紅茶、銷路依然疲滯云、</p>
<h3>五金青島帮來電停辦五金</h3>
<p>自暴日强佔東三省後、該路商業停頓、最近聞青島方面亦有不寗之象、因此昨日該帮某某等二號均接青島總號來電停止辦貨、致五金出路又少一路矣所幸天津烟台二帮交易邇來尚覺興奮、致成交數總在三四千担以上、而漢口帮點綴近來亦可差强人意、昨如馬口鐵開出四百餘箱、價十四兩、黑鐵皮白鐵皮亦銷去各有二三百担、竹節鋼英鋼板等該帮等亦有極强健之胃口、新鉛絲則因底貨不多、各路需胃良好、故市情極許樂觀、此外法西釘·大條鉛·三角鐵等、亦均有點綴、惟行情一節、漲落甚微、</p>
<h3>疋頭新衣帮量辦呢羢</h3>

<p>Japanese Troops in Eastern Provinces Still Not Withdrawing as Scheduled</p>

<p>League of Nations Executive Yuan</p>
<h3>To Convene Another Meeting</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Send Information to the Council</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Jilin Seem Unwilling to Withdraw Immediately</p>
<p>Meeting on the 14th Deemed Necessary</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Geneva received by diplomatic circles states: 1. The League of Nations Executive Yuan is scheduled to reconvene on the 14th. According to reports from both Chinese and Japanese sides and consulates of various countries, the Japanese side cannot withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian Railway zone before the 14th. When the Executive Yuan convened on the 4th, it specially invited important politicians from various countries, such as Briand, Curtius, and Litvinov, the foreign ministers of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, respectively, to attend. The Japanese side notified the Executive Yuan that it would withdraw its troops to Jilin. According to general observations, Japanese troops in Jilin are unwilling to withdraw immediately. 2. After the League of Nations Council meeting adjourned, our delegation continued to notify the League of Nations of news of Japanese military actions in Manchuria at any time. As of the 6th, our side had sent a total of forty-one documents to the League of Nations. At noon on the 6th, Minister Shih Chao-chi visited Sir Eric Drummond, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, to request that the construction of the Jihui Railway by Japanese troops be included in the scope of the investigation, and declared to the League of Nations that all postal and telecommunications agencies in the Eastern Provinces had been occupied by Japanese troops, making it extremely difficult to transmit messages. Even Reuters and the Associated Press, both organized by foreigners, have not seen any news coming from Shenyang. However, according to news from foreigners in Harbin, not only have the Japanese troops in Jichang not withdrawn, but they have also been ordered to publicly announce their withdrawal while secretly advancing towards northern Manchuria. According to our official report, Japanese military police are still occupying Shenyang, Jilin, Changchun, Liaoyuan, Xinmin, Niuzhuang, Andong, Fushun, Dunhua, Fenghuangcheng, Changtu, and other places. The League of Nations informed Minister Shih Chao-chi that it was urgently seeking to obtain prompt and accurate reports on the actions of Japanese troops in the Eastern Provinces and was exchanging messages with Paris and London from time to time. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the Manchurian Incident, Dr. Shih Chao-chi, the chief representative of China, has sent forty-one official documents to the League of Nations Council. In a recent note, he stated that according to a telegram from General Zhang Xueliang in Peiping, Japanese troops are still occupying Shenyang, Jilin, Zhengjiatun, and Xinmin, while Niuzhuang, Andong, and Changchun are also under Japanese control. General Zhang Xueliang believes that Manchurian postal and telegraph services are currently blocked by the Japanese, making it difficult to ascertain whether the Japanese troops have actually withdrawn. Although China is making efforts to conduct investigations, investigators are still having difficulty passing through Japanese-occupied areas. It is also stated that although Japanese troops have withdrawn from Kuanchengzi and Tongliao, they have not withdrawn from Changtu, Fushun, Gaiping, Dunhua, and Fenghuangcheng. Currently, because Japanese troops are occupying Shenyang, Jilin, Zhengjiatun, and Xinmin, China cannot exercise administrative power in those areas. Furthermore, according to Peiping newspapers, two trains of Japanese soldiers traveled to Tongliao, occupied the station, and then sent military aircraft to drop three bombs on Tongliao before withdrawing. According to a report from a Chinese banker who escaped from Shenyang, the city of Shenyang is in chaotic order due to disturbances by Japanese soldiers and Koreans. Shops are closed. Although the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to force a resumption of business, it is still difficult for banks to open. Citibank and HSBC are still closed. Not only is there a curfew in Shenyang at night, but there is also a curfew during the day from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The Japanese are wantonly slaughtering Chinese people. As the banker was fleeing, he witnessed three Chinese passengers at the Xinmin station being shot and killed by Japanese soldiers. According to foreign sources, Japanese troops in Changchun and Jilin have been ordered to take advantage of the chaos to advance to northern Manchuria. This news comes from foreign expatriates in Harbin. Today, Japanese representative Yoshizawa also informed the League of Nations Council that in areas within Shenyang that are not under Japanese military jurisdiction, banditry is rampant and most shops are closed. A thousand rioters attempted to invade a university, but were stopped by Japanese soldiers. It was also stated that bandits attacked Tientai, which is currently being maintained by the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, leading a Japanese civilian corps of 150 people, to maintain order. It was also stated that the Japanese military commander is currently raising funds to pay the salaries of the military police. It was also stated that a large battalion of Korean troops stationed to reinforce the South Manchurian Railway zone has been ordered to return to its original defense, and 160 soldiers stationed at Tashihchiao who had opened to the Yingkou railway line have also returned to their original station. Furthermore, 140 soldiers stationed at Tieling who had opened to Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin and Chinese railways along the line have also returned to their original defense. Furthermore, the Japanese note stated that it is currently ordering Japanese expatriates in Harbin and northern Manchuria to take refuge in Jilin, which is tantamount to indicating that Japan has no intention of withdrawing Japanese troops from Jilin on time. Therefore, people in the League of Nations today indicated that the Council will reconvene on the 14th due to receiving recent Chinese and Japanese notes. The Secretariat is currently making every effort to ensure that important figures in the European political arena, such as Briand of France, Grandi of Italy, and Leiding of England, can attend the meeting. (Reuters telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The recent developments in the Manchurian Incident are quite tense, so it is necessary for the League of Nations Council to convene a meeting on October 14. This is the news announced today. The announcement also stated that this meeting was decided during last week's Council meeting, so there is no need for special anxiety. Furthermore, if the situation can greatly improve in these few days, then the special meeting can be canceled at any time. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>Japanese Assistance</p>
<h3>Mongolian Princes Seeking Independence</h3>
<p>Supplying Large Quantities of Arms and Ammunition</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese are transporting military equipment from the Shenyang Arsenal in two trains to Taonan to help Mongolian princes seek independence. The equipment is handed over to thirty Mongolian students who have returned from studying in Japan, including two aircraft, four old cannons, four mortars, three thousand rifles, and a large amount of ammunition. Several thousand Mongolian soldiers are concentrated in Zhengjiatun. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) General Zhang Xueliang's headquarters received a telegram stating that the Japanese military authorities in Manchuria are now supplying arms and ammunition to Inner Mongolian leaders. Five trains loaded with ammunition, guarded by Japanese soldiers, arrived in Igusu on October 2. Japanese soldiers detained railway employees in a room and extinguished the lights at the station. Mongols used a hundred carriages to load the ammunition unloaded from the train and transport it to Inner Mongolia. The next day, another batch of ammunition was transported to a small station near Taonan and distributed to a thousand Mongolian soldiers stationed at Dahe. These Mongolian soldiers are led by thirty Mongolian youths who have studied in Japan. It is also heard that several Mongolian princes are currently leading troops stationed near Zhengjiatun, preparing to declare independence. They will enter Zhengjiatun in a few days. These people are supplied by the Japanese with three thousand rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, four mortars, and four mountain guns, all with ammunition, and two aircraft. This weaponry and ammunition are part of what the Japanese army seized from the arsenal after occupying Shenyang. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Withdraw Silver Deposits from Banks</h3>
<p>Two Million Yuan in Cash</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese army sealed up the vaults of the Shenyang Official Silver Bank and the Frontier Industrial Bank without touching them, but now they have suddenly withdrawn two million yuan in cash, the purpose of which is unclear. Former employees of the Shenyang Official Silver Bank and the Frontier Industrial Bank can still enter and exit, but are not allowed to take any items out. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The vaults of the Shenyang Official Silver Bank have been sealed up by the Japanese army without being touched. Li Youlan, a member of the Security Maintenance Association, was the former manager of the Official Silver Bank and has proposed opening the doors as soon as possible. Feng piao [emergency paper currency] is also gradually becoming popular in the market. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Suffers Plunder by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>(Peiping) After the Liaoning Army Food and Forage Plant was occupied by Japanese troops, they plundered all the stored grain. The plant directors, Wen Runfang and Lü Dongquan, have previously come to Peiping and established an office in Peiping for convenience. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops in Shenyang</p>
<h3>Plotting to Commit Arson</h3>
<p>(Peiping) A telegram from Shanhaiguan states that the Japanese army has been transporting large quantities of gasoline into Shenyang by truck in recent days, piling it up in the residences of important figures and inside various agencies, preparing to set fires when they withdraw their troops in the future, hoping to eliminate traces of looting and violence. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japan fears that our economic break with them will be fatal, and is resorting to violent and unreasonable means. On the one hand, they are lodging a serious protest against us for taking patriotic action, and on the other hand, they are sending a large number of warships to China in an attempt to intimidate us. At the same time, the Japanese army in Shenyang is plotting to burn the city of Shenyang in the hope of destroying evidence of their atrocities. The malicious intentions of the Japanese are evident. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan's So-Called Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Merely a Smokescreen to Deceive the World</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japan is purely imitating Russia's tactics towards Outer Mongolia and England's tactics towards Tibet in the Northeast. The so-called troop withdrawal is a smokescreen to deceive the world. At most, they will withdraw from unimportant locations by the deadline, like moving from the living room to the front door. What they consider must be resolved are the Jihui Railway, commercial lease rights, etc. The railway will be operated under the guise of entrusted management. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Collection of Valuables</p>
<h3>All Seized by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Including Calligraphy by Wang Xianzhi</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xueliang, upon receiving confirmation of the Japanese army's occupation of the Northeast, ordered the valuables and silver in his mansion to be bundled up and transported to Peiping by plane. Who knew that just as the packaging was completed, the plane was already being monitored by the Japanese army and could not depart, so it fell into the hands of the Japanese army. The most valuable calligraphy is Wang Xianzhi's seventeen-character inscription. The Japanese have long been aware of these treasures because in the past, Japanese advisors could enter the rooms and households at will, and they have long been coveting them. Now they have swept it all clean. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Japanese Protest Note</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Yet to Receive It</h3>
<p>An Important Figure Advocates for a Calm Response</p>
<p>Patriotic Movements Must Strictly Adhere to Discipline</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As of 6:00 p.m. on the 7th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received the Japanese government's protest note regarding China's anti-Japanese movement. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited an important figure in the central government to inquire about the future response strategy to the sudden dispatch of warships to Shanghai by the Japanese yesterday, and the rumored warning to the Chinese government that it must immediately stop the anti-Japanese movement of the people. According to him, the government has not received the Japanese government's note requesting the Chinese government to stop the anti-Japanese movement of the people as of this time, and there is only this rumor in the newspapers. In the future, if the Japanese government does send such a note, the government will not find it difficult to refute it with reason. Japan has unjustifiably occupied key areas of Liaoning and Jilin in our country, and our compatriots, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have spontaneously and unanimously risen up in resistance. This is a manifestation of national spirit, and the government has no reason to oppose this patriotic movement. As for the lives and property of Japanese expatriates, the government will do its utmost to protect them. As for the sudden dispatch of warships to Shanghai by the Japanese, their intention is nothing more than to demonstrate and provoke. We must uphold the spirit of perseverance and respond calmly. We must not be intimidated by threats or allow provocations, so their conspiracy will naturally have nowhere to go. At present, public sentiment is agitated, people's minds are uneasy, and rumors are easily spread. Our patriotic movements must have a spirit of discipline and order, and we must not be misled by rumors. If we are careless, it will be enough to affect social security, give foreigners an excuse, and make it impossible for the government to devote all its efforts to dealing with Japan. This is not the original intention of patriotism. Today, telegrams were received from Geneva and Washington, D.C., stating that the League of Nations and the United States are paying close attention to Japan's dispatch of warships to Shanghai. According to a certain foreigner, this move by Japan will only increase the resentment of the Chinese people and the criticism of various countries, which shows that international justice has not been completely extinguished. We must adhere to our policy and deal with this national crisis. If the entire nation can be of one mind and remain unwavering, we will not find it difficult to achieve ultimate victory in the future. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Central Standing Committee Convenes</p>
<h3>Temporary Emergency Meeting</h3>

<p>Discussing Measures to Maintain Order</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee, due to the proliferation of rumors and the ease with which the public is confused, convened a temporary emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 7th, gathering senior staff from the Central Party Headquarters, members of the executive and supervisory committees of the Peiping Municipal Party Committee, and various agencies and school authorities with responsibility for maintaining security, to discuss measures to calm the local area, maintain order, and guide public movements.

<p>(Nanjing) Public opinion here is very dissatisfied with certain wealthy families sending their luggage to Shanghai, saying that rumors are arising because of this, and those involved cannot escape their responsibility. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Inner Mongolian Leagues and Banners</p>
<h3>Conferring in Peiping to Dispel Rumors</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Amur, chairman of the joint Peiping representative association of various Inner Mongolian leagues and banners, told reporters that there are rumors outside that the Inner Mongolian princes are being incited by the Japanese to plot independence. He received a letter from Jerim, the leader of his banner league, on the 5th, reporting that the local area was peaceful. Only two or three days have passed, so he believes there will not be drastic changes. Prince Darhan is inherently honest and has lived in Shenyang for more than twenty years. He will never compromise with the Japanese. Prince Wendur has always advocated obedience to the central government. Since the Japanese army occupied Changchun, the telegraph line to his banner has been cut off. He has sent people back to his banner to inquire, and will convene a meeting of various princes in Peiping on the 8th to discuss ways to dispel rumors and send representatives to visit Deputy Zhang to report on the situation in Inner Mongolia.

(Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Mongolian expatriates in Peiping have sent telegrams to various leagues and banners, calling for the convening of a joint meeting of all Mongolian leaders to connect the borderlands, strictly guard against Japanese and Russian aggression, organize anti-Japanese groups, and recruit volunteer soldiers.

Dou Lianfang, a member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, called Zhang on the 7th, and Zhang said that the Japanese were spreading rumors.

<h3>Zhang Zongchang Arrived in Peiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Zongchang does not want to be a puppet for the Japanese and declared that he will never be a second Zhang Bangchang, so he first sent his mother to Peiping. Zhang himself arrived in Peiping yesterday and visited Deputy Zhang. His private residence in the Shi Lao Niang Hutong has been renovated. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Difficulty Raising Northeast Military Expenses</h3>
<p>(Peiping) There is still no solution to the Shenyang situation. The most painful thing at present is the issue of military pay and government expenses. The Northeast armies usually owe wages for about two months. The June wages were just paid off before the incident. After the incident, although the garrison outside the pass could eat locally, the large army inside the pass was insufficient with the strength of Hebei Province alone. Deputy Zhang first paid attention to this, so the Liaoning Provincial Government immediately ordered the establishment in Jinzhou to collect the money from the counties to relieve the current emergency. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the Japanese army occupied Liaoning and Jilin, financial problems arose in the Northeast. The Peiping Municipal Government has also been affected from time to time.

The government telegraphed Shih Chao-chi, our representative to the League of Nations, to notify the League of Nations. Shih replied to Nanjing on the 7th, saying that the League of Nations is paying close attention to the Mongolian independence incident. It is also heard that the United States government believes that Mongolian independence undermines China's territorial integrity and violates the Nine-Power Treaty of the Washington Conference, and the United States will make a serious statement when necessary. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Province Is Quiet</h3>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese have been spreading rumors that the Russian army will mobilize in Manchuria to protect its interests in China. This morning, the reporter visited Wan Fulin.

<p>(Shenyang) Today, Japanese troops in Shenyang are very active. According to news from Japanese official circles, Japanese reinforcements have been transferred to Xinmintun and Juluhe. It is rumored that Chinese stragglers have now crossed the South Manchurian Railway line and are heading west toward Xinmintun and the Liaohe River. It is said that the Japanese military's dispatch is due to this reason. According to official circles, Zhang Xueliang asked Commander Honjo to transport his personal belongings to Peiping. These items are currently being packed in order to be shipped out of Dalian. The Shenyang branch of the Bank of Chosen was robbed of 70,000 yen last night, but it is said that the original loot has been recovered. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Calm and Preparation</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese government, alarmed by the increasing scale and depth of our country's anti-Japanese movement and the growing blows it has sustained, has further implemented violent intimidation tactics. On the one hand, it issued a note of warning to our government; on the other hand, it dispatched a large fleet of warships to be stationed at various ports along our river. Its intention to use gunboat diplomacy to coerce our government and our people to halt the non-cooperation movement for self-preservation against violence, and to submit meekly to their trampling and slaughter, is plain for all the world to see.</p>
<p>At this juncture, the people of our country should by no means show alarm or cowardice. We should be orderly and steadfast, and we should make final preparations and a final resolution. What does it mean to not show alarm or cowardice? Although Japanese gunboats have been arriving one after another, we may not necessarily believe that they will commit any outrageous acts in this area where Chinese and foreigners live together and the world is watching. Even if they are muddled and unable to control themselves and intend to act recklessly, the humiliation of September 18th can only happen once. To uphold the dignity of our country and maintain the glory of our nation, we, the people who have been nurtured and educated by five thousand years of ancient Chinese culture, should know how to conduct ourselves at this final moment, and know how to defend ourselves. If we do not think deeply and become alarmed before they even act, we may not last a day. Or perhaps we will move our homes and seek another happy land. Then our country, our land, our home, and our room will not allow us to live in peace. In the end, can our nation obtain a piece of peaceful land as a place to live and die if we are cowardly and offer no resistance? Is cowardice and alarm beneficial? What does it mean to be orderly and steadfast? Even if the Japanese have the ambition to "act recklessly," they must also find an excuse. The recent exercises and demonstrations by Japanese troops in various places are clear evidence of their deliberate provocation. In response, we should fortify our walls and clear the fields, not act rashly, endure minor grievances, and avoid unnecessary sacrifices, so that even if those crazy people want to act recklessly, they will have no excuse. If the Japanese use the same trick of falsely accusing us as they did in the Mukden Incident and apply it in Shanghai or other places, then disaster will strike, and there will be no safe place to escape. We should defend righteousness with our blood and defend our motherland with our lives. We should not shirk our responsibility and should act bravely when we see what is right. Our people should also know how to make their own decisions. In short, the biggest goal of the arrival of the Japanese warships is to use intimidation to stop our non-cooperation movement. Our people must recognize that the non-cooperation movement against Japan is our nation's last remaining weapon for self-defense and self-preservation. We have absolute freedom to refuse to associate or trade with others for self-defense and self-preservation, and there is no room for anyone to interfere. Therefore, our people should make a final decision on this matter. We should adhere to the last remaining weapon in our hands to the very end and never be subdued by any intimidation or violence. The Indian nation, although conquered, its spirit is still enough to illuminate the world because its people were able to uphold the principle of non-cooperation and struggle resolutely. If our country today gives up this non-cooperation movement, which is the last remaining weapon, it will be taken away by others. Then what we will lose is not only the "non-cooperation movement," but also the spirit of founding the nation, which will be completely swept away.</p>
<p>What it means to make a final decision and make final preparations is to prepare to sacrifice, to prepare to wash away blood with blood. The people of our country should recognize that sacrificing for justice and righteousness has its own eternal and indelible glory.</p>
<p>We believe that darkness will eventually be destroyed by light, and demons will eventually lie dead at the feet of justice and righteousness. What do we have to worry about? What do we have to fear?</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents in Eastern Provinces Demand Continued Military Action</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, a large meeting of Japanese residents in Manchuria passed the following resolution unanimously: Due to the aggressive challenge to Japan by the Chinese governments in Nanjing and Shenyang, the Japanese government should decide to eliminate the roots of all troubles, regardless of any sacrifices. However, friendly relations should be maintained and enhanced with docile Chinese. The current military actions of the Japanese authorities in Manchuria should be maintained until the original objectives are achieved. The so-called original objectives are to maintain Japanese rights and eliminate the remnants of the Chinese army in the province to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria. This resolution has been sent to the Japanese government and major newspapers and political organizations in Tokyo. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Yuan Jinkai's Letter to Zhang</p>
<h3>Denies Forming Government</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Jinkai sent a letter to Deputy Zhang stating that since the incident occurred, due to the lack of responsible officials and public panic, a local maintenance committee was formed and a self-defense police force was established to protect merchants and civilians. This was by no means forming a government or declaring independence. Once the incident is resolved and responsible officials are in place, the committee will be dissolved immediately.

<h3>Hosts Dinner for Ministry of Foreign Affairs Staff</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Kamimura, hosted a dinner for some officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 7th. The officials were initially uneasy, fearing public censure. Later, they realized that since diplomatic relations between the two countries had not been severed and they were diplomatic officials, social interactions were part of their duty, so they went.

<h3>Discusses Diplomacy with Japan</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan and Liu Zhe are scheduled to return to Beiping on the 8th to report to Deputy Zhang on their discussions with the central government in Nanjing. According to Luo, the League of Nations has notified the Japanese side to withdraw its troops by the 14th regarding the incident in the Eastern Provinces. Our country has always respected the opinions of the League of Nations and trusts that its notification will be effective. The Washington Conference in 1920 had the nine signatory countries guarantee the integrity of China's territory. The entirety of Manchuria and Mongolia is Chinese territory. The Japanese action is tantamount to violating the convention observed by the nine countries, and it is hoped that the signatory countries will pay attention to it. Liu said that reports indicate that Puyi has secretly left Tianjin, but it is not certain. However, Puyi originally lived in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, and it is not impossible that he was taken away by the Japanese. In the past, Korea was conquered by Japan, and its king still existed under a false name for six years. Even if Puyi takes this outrageous step, he probably cannot maintain even a year of false name. He will only serve as a puppet of the Japanese. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The drafts of the telegrams to be issued by the Guangdong side are as follows: The Guangdong telegram briefly states that the communist disaster has not yet been eliminated, and the Yangtze River basin is suffering from floods, making it impossible to provide relief. Foreign insults have been suffered, and we and others have failed in our duties and feel guilty before the gods. We believe that only a unified national government produced by a unity conference can save us from danger. We respectfully follow the resolutions of the extraordinary meeting that if the unity conference is held and a unified national government is produced on schedule, then the current government in Guangzhou will be cancelled immediately.

<h3>U.S. Authorities Discuss Economic Decline</h3>
<p>White House Special Meeting</p>
<p>Decision to Form Lending Institution</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 7th - Last night, President Hoover held a special meeting at the White House. Important government officials and prominent bankers attended. Details of the meeting have not yet been revealed. However, Undersecretary of the Treasury Mills stated that President Hoover might change his opinion on the issue of disclosure and make an announcement after the meeting. The meeting adjourned at midnight. It was learned from well-informed sources at the adjournment that a decision had been made to form a lending institution called the Emergency Lending Corporation, with a capital of US$500 million, which could be used to provide loans to any financial combination at will. After the meeting, President Hoover issued a statement, stating that he intended to discuss with French Premier Laval further agreements on intergovernmental debts necessary during the economic downturn. The issue is essentially a restructuring that would benefit us and help the world recover during this economic downturn. Republican and Democratic members of Congress who attended the meeting strongly opposed President Hoover's idea of discussing this with Laval. Senator Borah is the leader of the opposition to extending the moratorium on intergovernmental debts.</p>
<h3>German Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>Brüning Ordered to Form New Cabinet</p>
<p>German President Issues Emergency Decree</p>
<p>Creating a Dictatorial Government</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th - The German cabinet resigned en masse this afternoon. Prime Minister Brüning submitted his resignation. After the President accepted it, he ordered him to continue handling government affairs as before until a new cabinet is formed. It is expected that the President will order Brüning to form a new cabinet this afternoon, and Brüning will accept the order. The new cabinet's foundation in the parliament will be broader than the old cabinet, and it is believed that Brüning will invite some prominent industrialists to join the cabinet. The cabinet's resignation was decided at a special cabinet meeting this morning, at which several emergency decrees were passed to deal with the critical situation. The content is very strict, effectively suspending the remaining constitutional protections of people's rights, such as freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the confidentiality of correspondence, to prevent political violence.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 7th - It is expected that President Hindenburg will order Brüning to form a new cabinet again. If Brüning can form a new cabinet that can barely obtain the support of a majority in parliament, Germany can still be ruled by emergency decrees, which is effectively a dictatorial system that can overthrow all opposition. If Brüning fails to form a cabinet, Germany's fate will be in the hands of Hitler and Mingenburg. The future is uncertain. Therefore, Brüning's work this time is very difficult, very important, and highly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Unstable Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>Facing Serious Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 7th - There are many rumors circulating here today about movements behind the scenes in the political situation that may affect the lifespan of the cabinet. The Japanese government is currently facing serious difficulties in balancing its budget, as some cabinet members oppose the fiscal austerity measures that Finance Minister Inoue considers essential. It is said that Inoue is confident that he can find a way to resolve the situation, but general rumors say that Inoue would rather resign than compromise. From an international standpoint, the most important thing to note is that as long as Inoue is in office, Japan will not prohibit the export of cash, but if Inoue resigns, the ban will be re-imposed, as there is a growing movement to advocate for the prohibition of cash exports.</p>
<p>British Government</p>
<h3>Agreed on Election Policy</h3>
<p>MacDonald Issues Manifesto</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - The cabinet met for two hours last night and adjourned at midnight. It has fully agreed on the National Government's election policy. This morning, Prime Minister MacDonald had an audience with the King and stayed at the palace for an hour. In the afternoon, the Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons that Parliament will be adjourned tomorrow and dissolved the day after tomorrow. The list of candidates in each constituency must be announced on the eighth day after the dissolution of Parliament, in accordance with constitutional regulations, i.e., October 16th. Voting will take place on October 27th, and the new Parliament will open on November 10th. All matters will be handled as quickly as possible to avoid delays. Members of the three parties in the National Government are free to conduct their election campaigns according to their party views. Whether to support the National Government is up to the people to decide. MacDonald will issue a manifesto in the name of the leader of the National Government, asking the people to grant him discretionary powers. At the same time, leaders of other parties will also issue manifestos to their party members. Liberal Party members in the government now recognize the government's actions and agree to support MacDonald, but Liberal Party leader Lloyd George opposes holding a general election at this time and considers the Liberal Party cabinet members' decision to be a betrayal of the party. Several constituencies plan to nominate MacDonald as a candidate, but MacDonald declined, wanting only to contest in the Seaham Harbour constituency. Although the Seaham Harbour Labour Party branch does not approve of him being the leader of the National Government, there are still many people in the Labour Party who trust MacDonald. MacDonald told people, "I am still a Labour Party member. I want to contest as a Labour Party candidate and raise the Labour Party banner." The Conservative Party and the Liberal Party may make concessions to each other in some places to avoid a three-way competition with the Labour Party. The securities market is now betting on the outcome of the election, predicting that the National Government will have a majority of 165 seats in the new parliament.</p>
<h3>White Russian Troops Invade Russian Territory</h3>
<p>Minor Contact with Red Army</p>
<p>Reuter's, Riga, 6th - According to Moscow sources, White Russian troops have invaded Russian territory from Manchuria and have begun fighting. Today, there was minor contact with the Red Army on the Russian border. It is said that the White Russian troops are subordinates of Semyonov, the leader of the White Russian troops in the Far East. The battle took place near the city of Amur Oblast, which is located just outside the border of northern Manchuria. It is also said that both sides suffered minor casualties. The Red Army captured several people and executed them on the spot. Russians claim that the White Russians are now cooperating with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Gold Standard and British Currency</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - Undersecretary of the Overseas Trade Department Young spoke at the Imperial Club today, discussing the gold standard, saying that Britain must restore the stability of its currency as soon as possible. He also said that since France and the United States have monopolized three-quarters of the world's cash, even if the gold standard is restored, it will not restore the stability of the British currency. As for which will be the official standard in the future, it is not possible to predict at this time. It depends on the possibility of convening an international conference to discuss the use and distribution of cash.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Shenyang Has Become a Dead City</h3>
<p>Roads Cut Off, Few Pedestrians, Bandits Rising Like Bees</p>
<p>Three Factions Confronting Each Other, Plotting Independence</p>
<p>A correspondent in Beiping who came from Shenyang yesterday described the tragic situation he witnessed there to the reporter. It was unbearable to hear. Here is a summary for the people of the country: "I (the speaker claimed)" received the bad news of the Shenyang Incident while still in Beiping. I was eager to return to the province to visit my family, but traffic was blocked and delayed for many days. Later, I went to Dalian via Tianjin. Upon arrival, the Japanese police were extremely strict in their inspection, repeatedly questioning why I had come. I told them the truth, but they didn't believe me. I was detained in the police station for a day, and my belongings were checked thoroughly, but nothing was found, and I was released. I took a car from Dalian to Shenyang. When I arrived at the Japanese station, the situation was the same as before, but the Japanese military's guard was stricter than usual. Driving into the city, passing through the Japanese station's Chiyoda Street, the most prosperous area, many Chinese shops on both sides were also closed due to the closure of the Chinese street. Arriving at Maluwan (the intersection of the Japanese station and the commercial port area), Japanese soldiers and police stood guard everywhere. Barbed wire was placed on the road, making it clear that it was in a state of emergency. Pedestrians passing through this area must be subjected to strict checks. Crossing Maluwan is 11th Latitude Road, the essence of the commercial port area. On weekdays, the road is full of traffic, like the Qianmen Street in Beiping. However, on that day, I only saw a dozen workers in short shirts walking back and forth on the street. Occasionally, I saw one or two cars, all of which were proud-looking Japanese. The feeling of vicissitudes was like a dream. The large hotels on both sides, such as the Dahua Hotel, Jiaotong Hotel, and Liaoning Hotel, were originally entertainment venues for modern men and women in Shenyang to dance, but now they have been transformed into Japanese troop garrisons. From Maluwan to the Great West Gate, no businesses were open, and the doors were tightly closed, much like the New Year. Although there were Chinese police on duty along the way, they only carried batons and no guns, and they had no power under the supervision of the Japanese. When the car arrived at the Great West Gate, I initially thought there would be an inspection, but unexpectedly, I was able to enter without obstruction. The situation inside the city was even more desolate. Not only were there few pedestrians on the road, but even the shops on the roadside seemed to have had no smoke from the kitchen for a long time. I went straight to my house, eager to see my family. I knocked on the door rather anxiously, and my family was startled by the unusual sound. At first, they didn't dare to answer the door. Then, they heard a familiar voice and asked who it was. When they opened the door and we met, we were filled with mixed feelings of sadness and joy. My family was safe, and my heart was finally at ease. The next day, I visited friends and learned more about the recent situation. I heard that after the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, they first occupied all military and government agencies, then the homes of those who were usually considered anti-Japanese, and then the intellectuals. In the first two days, the Japanese army would meet anyone on the street wearing a long gown or military uniform, regardless of who they were, and point their bayonets at them. Therefore, even now, it is still impossible to see many people wearing long gowns on the road. Currently, Japan is doing its best to incite local bullies to organize an independent government. In Shenyang alone, there are three factions standing separately. The first faction is the Local Public Security Maintenance Association of Yuan Jinkai, Yu Chonghan, and Li Youlan. This faction is under the command of the Japanese Governor-General and is actually performing the functions of the local government. The so-called Self-Defense Public Security Bureau is under its jurisdiction. Yuan, Yu, and others go to meetings every day, looking very happy, completely forgetting where they are. It is a great sigh that people's hearts have come to this. The second faction is the Four People's Maintenance Association organized by Kan Zhaoxi, Zu Xianting, and others. They advocate the rapid establishment of an independent government, with the cooperation of military and literary figures currently in Shenyang, under the protection of Japan, to handle all government affairs. Zu Xianting is the owner of the Yuelaizhan Inn and has a reputation as a restorationist in Liaoning. His relationship with the Japanese is particularly close. These people have not yet made any specific proposals for what kind of system the so-called independent government will adopt. It seems that the Japanese want to instruct them to test public opinion in general and then make a second step of proposals. This faction currently has no real power. The third faction is the Liaoning Gentry and People's Current Situation Discussion Association organized by Zhao Xinbo and others. Although this faction is active, it has not yet put forward any specific opinions, but it agrees with the first two factions in advocating the establishment of an independent government. Although the three factions each have their own ideas and go their own way, it goes without saying that they are all acting on Japanese intentions behind the scenes. The one thing that the three factions have in common is that they all advocate that all economic enterprises and transportation agencies in the Northeast should be changed to joint Sino-Japanese ventures, and that military equipment should also be within the scope allowed by Japan, to be sufficient for local security. In this way, all future disputes can be avoided, and the Northeast can permanently maintain a state of peace. Readers, think about it, isn't this method handing over the Northeast to others with both hands? Under Japanese protection, what independent government can there be? How can these insane traitors dare to openly advocate selling the country? Is their flesh still edible? The most wonderful thing is that there is another group of people who advocate building a five-race republic in the Northeast, uniting the Han, Mongol, Manchu, Japanese, and Korean people, never setting up military equipment, and always maintaining neutrality. All people of the five races can freely live, do business, and participate in politics. It can be said that this is a fantasy.</p>

<p>It is heard that Japan is organizing troops for the above three factions. At the same time, Guo Daofu was sent back to Hulunbuir to promote independence, and Prince Gong, who had been living in Lushun for many years, also went to Taonan with the Japanese Kawashima Naniwa to make plans. Judging from the actions of the Japanese, before withdrawing their troops, they will definitely put the Northeast in a state of division, supporting the power of local bullies to confront our country. Their intentions are extremely poisonous. However, there is also quite a bit of infighting among the Japanese military, such as the mayor of Shenyang, Doihara, and the commander of the military police, Mitani, who are competing for power and profit and fighting fiercely in secret. Searching homes and looting money are the points where they are most likely to conflict. As for the financial revenue agencies, the two are competing to send people to take them for themselves. Looking at the inside story, it is also extremely chaotic. After the Shenyang Incident, many firearms fell into the hands of the people, leading to a rise in bandits. After dusk, the roads are cut off, there are few pedestrians, and bandits are robbing everywhere. Gunshots are constant. Every night, there are more than a dozen robberies inside and outside the city. It is needless to say that the people cannot sleep peacefully. At present, those fleeing are still crowded. Those with a little money flee to Dalian, and those without money also hide in the countryside. The Northeast was originally a paradise outside the customs, but now it has become a hell on earth. Northeastern University and Feng Yong University were looted by bandits nearby. A professor at Feng University, whose wife was Japanese, did not have time to take away Japanese bedding when he took refuge, and the thieves left this item unstealed, which shows that the general Northeast people fear the Japanese like tigers."

<h3>The Actions of the Japanese Army in Shenyang</h3>
<p>None of them are contrary to Yoshizawa's statement</p>
<p>Reuter's, Shenyang Correspondence, 4th - People here are paying close attention to the so-called Manchurian independence movement by the Japanese. An independent government has been established in Jilin, and Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces will also follow suit. However, Chinese with knowledge say that this kind of independence means the demise of Manchuria within a few years. The previous events in Korea can serve as a lesson. It is noteworthy that the Japanese representative in Geneva formally stated at the League of Nations Administrative Council that the Japanese military occupation of Manchuria was not a military action. To what extent is this statement true? Let's take a few examples of the events carried out by the Japanese army in Manchuria to prove this. (1) Many aircraft in the Chinese airport have been confiscated by the Japanese army and repainted with Japanese markings, but in some cases, the Chinese markings can still be faintly identified because the repainting was not done well. (2) A large part of the mortar factory was converted into a motor truck manufacturing plant by the Chinese a long time ago. Now, the completed vehicles, as well as those that have not yet been assembled, and all the parts have been removed by the Japanese authorities. (3) The Japanese guards at the Shenyang Arsenal withdrew a few hours ago, so the Chinese were free to enter and found the factory in disarray, especially the warehouses. However, the Japanese soldiers returned a few days later and drove the Chinese out, so it was not possible to find out how many machines were taken from the factory. (4) The residences of important officials have mostly been searched and looted, and their cars have mostly appeared on the streets, being driven by the Japanese. It is also said that a large amount of cash and opium in Tang Yulin's house has been confiscated. There are many similar incidents that cannot be listed one by one. Those who witnessed the battle at Beidaying on the night of September 18th said that after the explosion (that is, the action that the Japanese claimed to have destroyed the South Manchurian Railway) occurred that night, just over ten minutes later, they saw a train of troop carriers coming at full speed and immediately attacking Beidaying. The Chinese soldiers there quickly retreated without any resistance.</p>
<h3>Russian Bandits Rising on the Chinese Eastern Railway Line</h3>
<p>Japanese Lumber Company Actually Providing Guns and Equipment</p>
<p>Hailar Correspondence - The Japanese coveting of Manchuria is known to the world. Now they are implementing armed aggression, and both Liaoning and Jilin provinces have been forcibly occupied. However, they still cannot forget the area of northern Manchuria. However, due to the Soviet Union's relationship with the Chinese Eastern Railway, it is inconvenient to drive straight in, so they secretly spread their claws, recruit White Russians, gather crowds to rob in the area north of Xiaolingzi and Daheshan, and provide guns and food from the Zhamian Company, which is run by the Japanese, in the hope of destroying the Chinese Eastern Railway, so that China and the Soviet Union will have contact, so that they can take advantage of the gap. The following is information obtained from various sources:</p>
<p>According to the fruit pickers who returned, there are more than 100 Russian bandits in the area north of Xiaolingzi and in Daheshan, who often go out to loot food. All their weapons and supplies are provided by the Japanese from the Zhamian Company. They are also introduced by the Japanese to befriend the Mongol bandits, and they do not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>According to the lumber workers, there is a nest of Russian bandits in Yufangzi, in the middle of the Xiaolingzi Zhengjiadang River, where more than 100 Russian bandits are hidden, all of them holding new Type 38 Mauser rifles, as well as two new light machine guns and one hand-held machine gun. The bandit leader used to be a brigade commander under Zhang Zongchang. The Zhamian Company constantly transports food to them. It was also heard that a few days ago, a Japanese went to the Zhamian Company to transport guns and ammunition, claiming that it was to protect the company's accounts. After that, the whereabouts of these guns and ammunition were unknown.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the Boketu Farmers' Association to the Hulunbuir Garrison Commander, on the 19th at dawn, 16 Russian bandits suddenly surrounded the Railway Station of Raobao, the lumberyard of the Xinyi Company and the lumberyard of Baolong, and more than 20 households nearby, and looted them. The bandits all used new Type 38 Mauser rifles and occupied the station for about nine hours before leaving with a roar. According to reports, the bandits are building nests in the forest area of the Zhamian Company in Beidahegou, Hulun County, and on the edge of the Crouching Ox River, and are carrying out large-scale construction, and are hiring poor people to cut sheep grass. They have more than 100 horses and new weapons. Judging from their actions, they have a long-term intention to occupy the area. They requested that a team be sent to suppress them. It is heard that the garrison stationed in Mian Duhe also had this report. Su Bingwen, the Commander of the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway Protection Army, immediately telegraphed Zhang, the Regimental Commander of Mian Duhe, ordering him to send a team to suppress them and stipulating a railway protection plan, and secretly ordered all the armies along the way to be fully vigilant. It is believed that these clowns will not be difficult to eliminate. However, judging from the above-mentioned reports from various parties, their schemes are endless, colluding with White Russian bandits to destroy international tranquility. The viciousness of their intentions is truly unprecedented. Fortunately, Su Bingwen, the Commander of the Railway Protection Army, has been governing the army for many years and is deeply trusted by the military and civilians. Since the incident occurred in Liaoning and Jilin, he has convened several high-level meetings to plan countermeasures, and has issued notices to protect foreign nationals, so the local area is quite peaceful.

<h3>Zhang Zuoxiang Arrives in Beiping from Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Planning to Stay in Beiping to Discuss the Aftermath of the Northeast</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - Zhang Zuoxiang, the Chairman of Jilin Province, arrived in Beiping yesterday evening (3rd) at 6:25 pm from his hometown of Jinzhou by special train in response to a telegram from Zhang Xueliang. At more than 9:00 am today, the train arrived at Tianjin East Station. Sun Chuanfang, Bao Guiqing, Wang Naibin, Dong Shi'en, and more than a dozen others went to the station to welcome him and talked with him on the train. At 9:30 am, the train arrived at the New Station. Wang Shuchang, Ji Yiqiao, and Zhang Xueming rushed to the station from Beiping and also talked with him on the train for an hour. At 11:50 am, the train left Tianjin for Beiping. Important figures in Beiping, such as Wan Fulin, Wang Shuhan, Chen Xingya, Yu Xuezong, Zhou Dawen, Tang Guozhen, Bao Yulin, Shao Wenkai, Gao Jiyi, Huang Xiansheng, and Li Yuan, and more than 20 others, went to the station to welcome him. Zhang's train arrived at the station at 2:25 pm, and the military music played loudly. Zhang was wearing a blue cloth lined robe and mandarin jacket, with a very long beard and hair, and looked quite melancholy. After getting off the train, he exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel and then went to Huang's residence at No. 4 Yandai Xiejie outside the Di'anmen Gate to rest with Huang Xiansheng. Yu Xuezong and others also went with him. The reporter group went to Huang's residence to visit him. Zhang was in a meeting with Yu and others, so Councilor An Yuzhen came out to meet them on behalf of Zhang. According to the interview, "This time, the Japanese army used violence to invade our Northeast, and the whole country is indignant. Our chairman was in mourning in his hometown, and he encountered national disaster again. He was filled with grief and indignation. Due to the Japanese army's violence, the telegram information in Jilin was isolated for a long time. Occasionally, someone went to Harbin from the provincial capital to send telegrams with news, which was also delayed. Therefore, it is difficult to report on the true situation at present. Chief of Staff Xi (Qia) is in the provincial capital, and under the oppression of the Japanese army, he can no longer control everything. In fact, it has become an unavoidable situation. Our chairman is here to discuss the aftermath of the East with the vice commander, and he will probably stay for a few days before deciding what to do next. Our chairman is temporarily staying here and has planned to find another house for office work." It is heard that Zhang Zuoxiang was accompanied by Secretary-General Wang Huanran, Aide-de-camp Song Shoushan, Councilor An Yuzhen, Director General Xu of the Northeast Reclamation Bureau, Director General Li of the Jilin Electric Company, and more than 100 staff members and guards. After resting at Huang's residence, Zhang went to Shuncheng Prince's Mansion to pay a visit to Zhang Xueliang. Xueliang hosted a banquet at his residence that evening to welcome him and invited Wan Fulin, Wang Shuhan, Yu Xuezong, and others to accompany him. (4th)</p>
<p>Cantonese Merchants</p>
<h3>Implementing Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>People From All Walks of Life Are Participating in the Anti-Japanese Salvation Movement</p>
<p>A Bomb Exploded in Front of a Western Goods Store in Xiguan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - Recently, people from all walks of life in the province have started an anti-Japanese movement. All counties and villages have convened anti-Japanese salvation conferences and demonstration parades, and have voluntarily implemented economic sanctions against Japan. There are too many conferences and parades to count. It can be seen from this that the people's hearts have not died. Recently, inspection teams have been set up everywhere in the areas that have implemented economic sanctions against Japan. If any Japanese goods are found entering the country, they will be burned in public. In Guangzhou, anti-Japanese demonstration movements are held every day, and the order is very good. However, those who sell Japanese goods illegally are dealt with severely. The Guangxinglong Chinese and foreign goods store on Tongxing Street in Xiguan was suspected of selling Japanese goods on weekdays. Suddenly, at about 6:00 pm on the 30th, a huge bomb exploded in front of the store, causing a sensation in the city. At first, the citizens thought that the bomb came from the city. After the fire brigade rushed to rescue the injured, they learned that the store had been bombed. A huge hole was pierced in front of the store, and a partner and a customer were injured in the store and sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment by the fire brigade's rescue team. It was found that the store's partner, Huang Kang, was working at the counter when the bomb exploded, causing injuries to his right foot and leg. The customer, Deng Jingquan, was in the store to buy walnut powder and was about to write down the list when shrapnel flew over and injured both ankles. He immediately fell to the ground. Fortunately, the injuries were not fatal, and he woke up after a while. The police then took the store owner to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. According to him, the store sells miscellaneous Western goods. That day, when a customer came to trade, he suddenly saw a man in black coming to the door and throwing a bomb in, injuring two people. Afterwards, a letter was found in front of the store, signed by the Iron Blood Corps, stating that it was a warning letter. The letter stated that the Japanese soldiers had forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces and bullied our country too much. Anyone with blood and energy would be outraged, so they have all risen up to implement economic sanctions. This group has previously warned you merchants not to sell Japanese goods. Now you cold-blooded merchants are actually doing the opposite and continuing to trade as usual. We have no choice but to resort to this method. We are giving you a second warning. If you continue to sell Japanese goods, we will definitely destroy all the stores on the street that sell Japanese goods in order to eliminate the traitors. Below is signed "Iron Blood Corps respectfully." After checking, the injured store partner went to the hospital for medication and was not seriously injured and has returned home for treatment. The customer, Deng, was slightly injured and left the hospital on his own the next day. Since this incident, merchants have been warning each other to voluntarily refuse to sell Japanese goods. (September 2nd)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Circles' Resistance Against Japan and National Salvation</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Have Left Wuhu for Shanghai</p>
<p>The County Party Headquarters today convened a meeting of all sectors to discuss resistance against Japan. Resolutions included: Party members who purchase Japanese goods will have their party rights suspended; civil servants will be suspended from their duties; the public will be deprived of their civil rights; schools will organize volunteer armies; party members will form suicide squads; civil servants in all agencies will begin military training; banquets and entertainment are prohibited; ten commandments of non-cooperation with Japan are promulgated; and a general meeting of all sectors will be held again at 2 p.m. on the 8th to begin preparing for the establishment of a volunteer army.</p>
<p>The Wuhu educational circles previously planned to send representatives to the capital to petition the National Government, declare the diplomatic policy towards Japan, and request a deadline for the recovery of lost territory in the Northeast. The faculty and students of Jianguo Middle School, Wuhu Guan Middle School, and Rice Industry School have now been designated as representatives, who, together with anti-Japanese association representatives Hong Wenbin and Zhang Yuxiang, will depart immediately.</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of all industry guilds the day before yesterday to organize a committee of the business community to conduct self-inspection of Japanese goods. However, the Party Headquarters did not approve it. The Chamber also formulated nine kinds of slogans for resisting Japan and saving the country and printed tens of thousands of copies, which were posted at the entrances of all commercial establishments in the city.</p>
<p>The issue of rapeseed exports from Wuhu has been discussed in several meetings. Today, another meeting of all sectors was convened at the County Party Headquarters, which resolved that rapeseed exports are entirely supplying raw materials to Japan and should be completely stopped. Japanese residents of Wuhu have completely left Wuhu for Shanghai on the orders of their government. However, Japanese Consul Shibasaki and Shirao remain in Wuhu, and there is one Japanese warship, the Hailong, anchored on the river surface at the customs office. (6th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Years-Old Tang Family Murder Case Comes to Light. The County Public Security Bureau, in light of the recent series of theft cases in the urban and rural areas, specially dispatched Inspector Yang Shijie to pay attention to investigation and arrest, and to ensure that the case is solved. Inspector Yang received a report from an informant yesterday that a known thief, Shen Shaoqing, was hiding in the west of Dakura Bridge. Yang recalled the assassination of Tang Zhikui, the owner of Tang Helong Oil and Sesame Store, in September of last year, which was widely suspected to have been committed by Shen Shaoqing, because Shen disappeared after the Tang family murder case. The unsolved case has remained unsolved to this day. Yesterday (6th) afternoon, Yang led detectives to follow the trail and arrest Shen, and recovered a package of stolen goods, which were taken to the bureau for temporary detention. A preliminary interrogation was scheduled for today. According to Shen Shaoqing, the murder of Tang Zhikui, the owner of Tang Helong Oil and Sesame Store, at 2:05 a.m. on September 5 of last year, was done by me and two unnamed people. However, the case was initiated by Tang Zhikui's son, Da Guan. The two unnamed people were also called by Da Guan. We negotiated at the Bailongtan Opium Den before we took action. That night, Da Guan arrived home first. The three of us went west from Xiaodai towards the back door of the Tang family. I pried open the door, and the two unnamed people went inside and killed Tang. I was keeping watch at the waist door. When the wind called for help, the three of us escaped along the original route. When the official questioned why you were willing to help without any benefit, Shen Shaoqing confessed that there was an iron box in Tang Zhikui's bedroom containing more than a thousand yuan in banknotes. After killing Tang, Da Guan allowed us to take whatever we wanted. Unexpectedly, people got up and called for help, and we did not have time to take the banknotes. He also admitted to the theft cases involving the Zhang family outside the city. Tang Zhikui died a tragic death. Now, more than a year later, the murderer has been arrested. It can be said that the net of heaven is vast, and no one can escape.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire at the Border of Suzhou and Wujiang. The Majiadang Road Lantern Entrance area, which is located at the border of Wujiang and Wuxian counties, is near Taihu Lake and is often frequented by bandits. The day before yesterday (6th), Xu, the captain of the 14th team of the 3rd District of the Water Police, stationed there, received a report from detective Hu Deyi that three bandit boats were parked at the Road Lantern Entrance, with about twenty bandits gathering in Shen's straw shed. Captain Xu immediately dispatched a detachment led by Captain Wang to set out with their boats and surround the straw shed. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire and resisted. The two sides exchanged fire for an hour, killing two bandits. The remaining bandits abandoned their boats and fled towards Taihu Lake. Captain Wang immediately ordered his subordinates to set fire to and destroy the straw shed.</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Japanese Goods Seized at the Station. After the reorganization and establishment of the Wuxian Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, its work has been extraordinarily diligent. The inspection committee of the association seized about two hundred pieces of Japanese goods, including foreign cloth and paper, worth more than 17,000 taels, at the railway station on the 6th. They were transported from Shanghai to Suzhou, carried by Huitong and Dingtong forwarding companies. They were immediately seized and sealed up, and reported to the association for disposal. The guilds of the opera costume industry and other industries jointly sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association yesterday (7th), requesting strict punishment. The Committee for Economic Severance with Japan by Merchants has also sent personnel to investigate whether they are entirely Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Burning Seized Japanese Goods on Double Ten Day. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held a committee meeting yesterday, which resolved: (1) All yarn factories should take the opportunity to raise market prices during the boycott of Japanese goods by all sectors. A letter should be sent to the County Chamber of Commerce to find a way to stop it. (2) The County Chamber of Commerce forwarded a telegram from the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce stating that the Taisheng Paper Company in the county was shipping American paper to the Derunxiang Paper Company in Changzhou, which was all seized. Please identify and release it. After investigation, it was found that there were many kinds of Japanese Sankai brand paper in the seized paper goods, which had been identified as genuine. They were all affixed with the words "Inspected and Verified" by the Wuxian Paper Industry Guild's inspection of Japanese goods, which was obviously intended to deceive. A letter should be sent to the Wuxian County Party Headquarters to dissolve the association and severely punish it in accordance with the measures for punishing treacherous merchants. (3) The Investigation Section has seized a large number of Japanese goods in various stores in recent days, which proves that the registration of Japanese goods has not been taken seriously. After the seizure, all of them should be burned, and heavy fines should be imposed separately. The shopkeepers should be made to stand in wooden cages and paraded through the streets to be shown to the public. Those whose circumstances are serious will be treated as traitors. The punitive measures will be formulated separately. (4) The Japanese goods seized by the Inspection and Investigation Sections have been formally identified and announced in the newspaper. It has been decided to hold a burning ceremony at the library gate on the afternoon of the 10th of this month. (5) Two teams of the Volunteer Army Training Team have been established, but there is a shortage of guns. The methods of raising funds are: (A) Petition the central government to issue them; (B) Raise funds and purchase them yourself; (C) Borrow them from the merchant corps guild. (6) Establish a Japanese goods exhibition hall to facilitate identification. Cheng Jingtang, Li Baisen, and Xu Hanqing were recommended to solicit and prepare for it. (7) The Japanese goods seized in Qiuxin and Xinming stores should be burned, and fines should be imposed at the original price. A serious warning should be published in the newspaper. If any other stores are found in the future, the shopkeepers will be made to stand in wooden cages and their stores will be closed.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Smuggled Japanese Goods. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has been very serious about the inspection of Japanese goods recently. In addition to starting to seal up the Japanese goods stored for sale in various shops, it has also paid special attention to the stations where goods are transported. Yesterday, the picket team of the association seized 55 packages of Japanese sugar, 20 pieces of Japanese yarn, and 3 pieces of Japanese paper carried by the Yuelai Company at the Zhentong Wharf. It also arrested Hong Shuoren, an employee of the company. The association believes that the company dared to commit such a great crime at a time when the country is in trouble and the people are in grief and indignation. It is necessary to punish it severely. In addition to sending the employee Hong Shuoren to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for custody, the goods were completely carried to the association. A meeting will be convened to discuss punishment measures. A Strangled Male Body Found Under Tangtui Mountain. At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, Sun Zhenchun, a patrolman from the first station of the third sub-bureau, found a male body under the foot of Tangtui Mountain in the public sports field. He immediately reported it to the sub-bureau chief and forwarded it to the court for examination. It was found that the deceased was about thirty years old, with fresh blood flowing from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. His neck was surrounded by hemp rope, which was tied to the root of a tree. It was confirmed that he had been strangled to death while alive. A piece of letter paper and four small foreign coins were found beside him. During the examination, someone who knew him said that the deceased was He Junchen, the owner of the Huayang Hotel in Jiangjun Lane. They immediately informed his family. His wife, Qin, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and recognized her husband. She couldn't help but cry bitterly.

The court ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial and went to the hotel to interrogate all the waiters to await investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Compulsory Education Office Compiles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>While the 3rd session of the Correspondence Department for Teacher Training organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Office for Joint Compulsory Education is recruiting students, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Liaoning, Jilin, and other provinces. The people of the whole country are indignant and swear to save the country. The department believes that primary school teachers in various places should earnestly publicize the Japanese army's invasion conspiracy and the critical situation in Northeast China in order to jointly seek relief. At the beginning of the department's courses, anti-Japanese national salvation teaching materials were compiled. The ambition of Japan's invasion policy and its causes and consequences, as well as the methods for the people to deal with it, were described in extremely precise terms, and questions were raised everywhere to inspire education. The full text is about 40,000 words. All correspondence students, past and present, will be sent a copy. The department has received many requests from various places to recommend participants and has specially rescheduled the opening of classes to October 15. Applications can still be made before October. Graduates will be informed by letter to the Education Bureau to be assigned to primary school teacher positions as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Notifies Schools Not to Easily Believe Rumors</h3>
<p>Cannot Take Leave Without Authorization</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued Notification No. 56 to all schools regarding not easily believing rumors and taking leave without authorization: It has been found that some schools in the city intend to suspend classes temporarily due to rumors outside. The local area in the city is quiet and normal, and schools at all levels should attend classes as usual. Do not easily believe rumors and take leave without authorization, causing more disturbances. This notice is hereby issued for compliance. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Universities Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Committee Tao Baichuan Attended the Meeting to Dispel Rumors</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of students from various universities in the city held the 12th emergency meeting of the executive committee at the Xiaonanmen Youth Propaganda Group at 9 a.m. yesterday. The situation was extremely tense. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Executive Directors Present: Li Chunsen from the College of Political Science and Law, Hu Wenquan from Datong University, Ping Zuren from Jinan University, Chen Yuejiang from the Sino-French Institute of Technology, Zhu Youxian from Guanghua University, Zhang Taosong from the Law School, Xu Guanbin from Daxia University, He Jingyuan from China Public School, Li Yuanzhang from Fudan University, Gu Jiwu from Jiangnan College, and other executive directors from more than ten schools attended. Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, attended the meeting to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: The temporary chairman was Li Yuanzhang, and the recorder was Li Chunsen. After performing the ceremony, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, reported the situation of Anning in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Party Committee Report: Standing Committee Member Tao said that the arrival of the Japanese fleet in Shanghai has made people in the Zhabei Gaochang Temple area extremely volatile in the past two days. However, based on the facts today and referring to the news from the party, government, and military, Shanghai, due to its location and other relations, the Japanese army has no possibility of occupying it. The Japanese army has had a twenty-year plan to invade Shenyang, so it can carry out its ambitions arbitrarily and arbitrarily in the Northeast. It would not dare to make a calculated demonstration here. Regarding the people, they should save meaningless waste, such as posting slogans, parades, and other superficial work, which can easily be used as an excuse by the Japanese. The municipal government and the Public Security Bureau are actively planning to avoid this kind of meaningless action and do practical anti-Japanese national salvation work. The party, government, and military guide the people to carry out anti-Japanese movements on the right track in order to obtain the most effective results. People have been extremely panicked in the past two days. The reason is that a poster with shapes and colors was posted on the wall between Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road, depicting the brutal killing of the people in the Northeast by the violent sun and the way the Chinese should deal with it. The Japanese residents were quite touched by it and telegraphed the Japanese government to send warships to Shanghai to protect the Japanese residents. The Japanese newspaper took the opportunity to spread rumors, causing great panic among the Chinese people. Regarding the Northeast incident, the League of Nations has sent the Spanish Consul General in Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation to see whether the Japanese army can withdraw to its original defense before the 14th. The diplomatic method is like this, but the Japanese army intends to permanently occupy the Northeast, so it sends warships to China to provoke and create the only excuse. Under this situation, the people should try their best to avoid a frivolous move. Of course, China's own strength is not enough in diplomacy, and its military preparedness is not as good as Japan's. Therefore, it must devote itself to international propaganda and tell the details of the violent Japanese invasion of China to countries that can be approached. The municipal party and government agencies have reported to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai to make it clear that the Chinese people are completely fighting for peace to save China. The high morale of the people now is a legitimate expression. Because foreigners rarely read Chinese newspapers and only know news that is unfavorable to China, this kind of propaganda work is very important. As for preparations, China, of course, cannot rely solely on foreigners. The important municipal military and political agencies have made considerable preparations and are making proper defenses to reassure people. There is no need to deeply believe in the rumors that are unfavorable to Shanghai. There are also detailed answers to the issues of the Student Federation sending representatives to request the issuance of firearms, hiring instructors, and having half-day classes and half-day military training in various schools.</p>
<p>Key Resolutions: (1) The representative of the Sino-French Institute of Technology reported that a conflict had occurred with the school authorities due to the issue of suspension of classes. What should the association do? It was resolved that the association should send a representative from Jiangnan College, Gu Jiwu, to the Sino-French Institute of Technology to explain the main points of the association's resolution. (2) The association should send representatives to attend the joint meeting of university presidents yesterday to explain the main points of the Student Federation's resolution in order to facilitate the association's progress. It was resolved that the association should send two representatives from Guanghua College of Political Science and Law to attend. (3) How should the issue of the people who are working hard for the anti-Japanese national salvation work in various schools being absent from classes due to work be resolved? It was resolved that the representatives attending the university presidents' meeting should explain as an attachment that it should not be regarded as absence from classes and should send a letter to the school authorities. (4) The travel expenses for the representatives going to Beijing to request the government to allocate firearms. It was resolved that each person should be allocated 20 yuan by the association and reported and reimbursed upon returning to Shanghai. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Associations of Universities Request the Dispatch of Instructors and the Issuance of Firearms</h3>
<p>In addition to holding a meeting of executive directors yesterday morning, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of various universities in Shanghai decided to send two representatives, Jiang Peng and Li Yaodong, to Beijing to request Chairman Chiang of the National Government to issue firearms in order to complete soldier education. In addition, a message was sent to students in North China to stop Cao Sun and others from taking the opportunity to engage in activities.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Officially Resumes Classes Today</h3>
<p>To Reassure the People of Jiangwan</p>
<p>Fudan University in Jiangwan has been greatly frightened by rumors from the outside in the past two days, so that students throughout the school are unusually alarmed and have no intention of attending classes. More than 100 people have already asked for leave to return to their hometowns. Therefore, after discussion by the school authorities, it was decided to suspend classes for one day yesterday. Now, because the important party and government agencies in the city have tried their best to dispel rumors and the Zhabei area is as quiet as before, the school will officially resume classes from today. Those who do not attend will be considered absent.</p>

<h3>Charity Tennis Schedule Revised, Lin and Qiu Meet</h3>
<p>Let's See How High or Low They Are</p>
<p>No Competition Today, Starts Tomorrow</p>
<p>The charity tennis schedule for the national masters performance competition was published in the newspaper the day before yesterday. Due to the fact that the third and fourth members of the Malayan team went to Ning due to business, they could not participate, so the entire schedule was rearranged yesterday and changed to start at 3 p.m. on the 9th (Friday). There is no competition today.</p>
<p>Singles Schedule</p>
<p>Preliminary Round Starts at 3 p.m. on the 9th</p>
<p>Semifinals Start at 2:30 p.m. on the 10th</p>
<p>Finals Start at 2:30 p.m. on the 11th</p>
<p>Doubles Schedule</p>
<p>Tianjin vs. Malaya at 4:30 p.m. on the 9th</p>
<p>Shanghai vs. Loser of Tianjin vs. Malaya at 4:30 p.m. on the 10th</p>

<p>Malaya Team: Lin Wangsu, Yang Lun, Zhang</p>
<p>Shanghai Team: Qiu Feihai, Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>Lin and Qiu Meet</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, who is higher or lower in recent years, opinions differ. According to the scheduled schedule, they will meet at the China Tennis Court at 2:30 p.m. on National Day. The preliminary round is undoubtedly Qiu will win Gao. After three years of separation, I don't know what changes have taken place. It will be a sensation in the tennis court again. The competition will be played in a best-of-five-sets format, using Slazenger balls.</p>
<h3>French Lawn Tennis Association Announces World's Top Ten Tennis Players</h3>
<p>Opinions of the Captain of the Davis Cup Team</p>
<p>(Paris News) Jerome, Chairman of the French Lawn Tennis Association, announced the top ten tennis players in the world this year as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cochet (France) (2) Vines (USA)</p>
<p>(3) Austin (England) (4) Shields (USA)</p>
<p>(5) Perry (England) (6) Borotra (France)</p>
<p>(7) Lott (USA) (8) Doeg (USA)</p>
<p>(9) Wood (USA) (10) Sato Jiro (Japan)</p>
<p>Jerome is the captain of the French Davis Cup team (not participating in the competition), and his views are naturally superior. French public opinion is quite inconsistent with the position of Austin and Perry, with some placing Perry in third place and Austin in fifth place. However, Jerome's opinion is as follows: Austin defeated Shields at the Anglo-American Davis Cup, and Borotra also lost to Shields at the French Championships, while Austin defeated him. Austin had already gained momentum in the Wimbledon semifinals and lost to misfortune. Perry defeated Wood twice in Paris and New York, and also defeated Lott and Van Ryn twice in New York. However, he lost to Tilden at the French Tennis Championships, lost to Wood at Wimbledon, and lost to Shields at the Davis Cup, so his position cannot be higher.</p>
<h3>Illness of Two Athletes from Jinan University</h3>
<p>Zhuang Shihong and Zeng Rongzhong</p>
<p>Recently, two famous athletes from Jinan University have been seriously ill. One is Zhuang Shihong, who became ill due to the national salvation movement, which was too stimulating for a while. He is now being treated by a doctor and has reported that he is no longer using medicine. The other is Zeng Rongzhong, who suddenly vomited blood after participating in the 400-meter race at the Municipal Games, accounting for one or two liters. He is in critical condition and is seeking treatment at the Red Cross Hospital. The doctor said that he had exercised too vigorously, his blood vessels had ruptured, and he had lost too much blood. A classmate has borrowed blood to supplement him, but he has not yet been out of danger.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, the Malayan Football Team Defeats the Western Team</h3>
<p>=Superior in Spirit and Skill丨Five Games, Four Victories=</p>
<p>=Champion Western Team Meets Formidable Opponent丨Entire Army Collapses in Second Half=</p>
<p>丨Await Tomorrow and See the Efforts of the Chinese Team丨</p>
<p>丨Scheduled to Play Against Jinan University Team on the 13th丨</p>
<p>The Malayan Overseas Chinese Football Team, gathering the essence of overseas Chinese players from the Malayan Federation, braved the winds and waves to return to the country to participate in the National Games. Contrary to their wishes, they led the team to fight in Hong Kong and Shanghai, so that compatriots at home, who admired their fame but had no way to see their style, could have a true understanding. In Hong Kong, they played three games, winning two and losing one, leaving a good impression that has long been etched in the hearts and minds of the people of Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Charity Match丨Crowds Gather</h3>
<p>丨Joyfully Witnessing the Triumphant Return of Overseas Chinese丨</p>
<p>The Chinese National Sports Association sent a special telegram inviting the team to Shanghai for a charity match for disaster relief. Yesterday, the heavens smiled, releasing light from the cloudy rain. A Sino-Western charity match was thus realized at the Chinese baseball field. Amidst the national crisis, hearing that our compatriots had come from thousands of miles away, these outstanding warriors will surely promote our national prestige on the football field. At one point, crowds gathered to participate in this grand event, benefiting the disaster victims and satisfying their eyes. The intention was excellent. In the seventy-minute battle, it was joyful to see the Malayan Overseas Chinese fight their way out of hardship, turning defeat into victory, and finally returning triumphantly. The ticket revenue from this event was 601 one-yuan tickets and 4,652 six-jiao tickets.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Heroes丨Great Battle with the Western Team</h3>
<p>丨Qiu, the Center Forward, Has Superb Skills丨</p>
<p>The Malayan team's players are well-organized and have outstanding skills. It is a grand gathering of overseas Chinese heroes. In the great battle with the Western team, they won five to four, which is a natural outcome where the superior triumphs and the inferior is defeated. Among the five forwards, Qiu Yongyuan, the center forward, was the most outstanding. He excelled in heading and kicking, running fast and passing quickly. Left inside forward Guan Shunde from the left wing, Li Wenjie, was skilled in cooperation and good at shooting. He would stop whenever there was an opportunity and always make progress. Right inside forward Ruan Guoying also did his best. Right wing Chen Meian, who was not originally a regular player, performed slightly weaker. The center backs Deng Yuehan and Cai Wenli were extraordinarily active, supporting the attack and defending when retreating. They were remarkable. Xu Yahui was light and agile, but he could not stop the activities of the opponent's Huo Gengsheng. The veteran Yu Weihua, who was once famous, still has skills, but lacks agility and has more toughness. He was more than enough to fight against the iron man Turner. Qin Yuanlian was majestic and awe-inspiring, like Jiang Taigong being present and having no taboos. Goalkeeper Liu Jinrong had both flaws and strengths, but he was also a first-class player.</p>

<p>Xu Yahui　Chen Meian</p>
<p>When the Strong Meet丨Champion Fails</p>
<p>丨The Momentum Was Loud at the Start丨</p>
<p>In the seventy-minute battle, the Western team was very loud in the first fifteen minutes, sweeping and attacking directly, with no one else in sight. In two minutes, they broke through the defense and scored. They continued to attack from the left and right. After fifteen minutes, the situation changed abruptly. The two sides came and went, with equal effort. By the second half, the entire army was exhausted, collapsing again and being controlled by others. The goalpost had a spirit and cleared the danger several times for them. Otherwise, there would have been a greater difference in the score. Huo Gengsheng was the most dangerous person in the entire team. The goalkeeper also performed very well. Except for the fourth goal, the rest were not his fault. In addition, everyone else performed well, but they were not as tough as they were at the beginning. That was the reason for the failure. If the field was dry, both teams would have performed better.</p>
<p>Helei　Huo Gengsheng</p>
<p>Shigude　Turner</p>
<p>Buleilai　Zha Xu (Captain) Adamu</p>
<p>Stihua　Jieke</p>
<p>Jibusheng　Okelei</p>
<p>One to Zero丨Lost Momentum at the Start</p>
<p>丨Huo Gengsheng Succeeded with One Kick丨</p>
<p>The two armies arrived, waiting for the referee to give the order. They could not find a suitable person temporarily. After a long time, Secretary Zhou Jiaqi volunteered to serve the ball. Malaya kicked off, but the ball went into the hands of the opponent. The opponent almost used a free kick, forcing a corner kick. Turner headed the ball, and it fell between the two defenders. Huo Gengsheng, as if divinely assisted, raised his foot and attacked the goal directly, scoring a goal. The score of one to zero was created in two minutes.</p>
<p>One to One丨Captain Achieves Merit</p>
<p>丨Malaya's Vigor Burst Forth丨</p>
<p>After the Western team won a goal, they stepped up their work. The situation changed abruptly, and the situation was bad. Although the Malayan forwards advanced from time to time, they stopped halfway. After fifteen minutes, things turned around. The inside defense was strengthened, and the forwards were effective. The Western team's goal was in a bad situation. Once, a successful offside was not counted. Captain Ruan received a pass from the left wing and headed the ball into the goal, making the score one to one.</p>
<p>Two to One丨Turner Gets the Ball</p>
<p>丨Western Team Takes the Lead in the First Half丨</p>
<p>After that, Malaya continued to attack with all their might, but it was not successful. Qiu, the center forward, was like a giant, and his technique seemed to be above Dai Linjing in Shanghai and Feng Jingxiang in Hong Kong. Zha Xu had no way to deal with him. Twice he broke through the defense alone, but failed. Another time, the left and right wings shot together, but the goalpost blocked them. There was nothing they could do. Under a good situation, Turner accidentally got a ball, raised his foot and kicked it into the net. In the first half, the Western team took a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Two to Two丨The Entire Field Was Surprised</p>
<p>丨Showed Their Skills in Two Minutes丨</p>
<p>In the second half, Qiu, the center forward, led the entire army in a mighty manner, coming from all directions. The ball went from the center to the left, and the left wing picked it up in the middle. The goalkeeper扑地救之, but could not stop it. The ball crossed in front of the goal, and right inside forward Ruan Guoying kicked it with his foot, scoring a goal. In two minutes, the score became two to two. The entire field was surprised.</p>
<p>Three to Two丨Malaya Turns Around</p>
<p>丨Qiu, the Center Forward, Has Excellent Heading Skills丨</p>
<p>The Western team was active for a while, and Huo Gengsheng took the opportunity to attack the goal again. The inside was empty, but fortunately, the goalkeeper saved it in time, averting the danger. After surviving a great disaster, there must be good fortune. Sure enough, within ten minutes, under Malaya's constant attacks, Qiu, the center forward, suddenly rushed forward and scored from the right again. Qiu, the center forward, headed the ball into the goal, cleanly and beautifully. It was not easy. Three to two, Malaya turned around from then on.</p>
<p>Three to Three丨Western Team Rises Again</p>
<p>丨Internal Emptiness in the Midst of Busyness丨</p>
<p>Malaya's left wing, Li Wenjie, was injured and left the field for rest, reducing their strength. Huo Gengsheng was active again. The goalkeeper pushed the ball backwards. Qiu, the center forward, skillfully avoided several people and passed the ball to the center. Left inside forward Guan Shunde hit the goalpost, which was very unfortunate. In the midst of busyness, Malaya's inside was empty. After three or four passes, the Western team's Jieke caught up and kicked the ball in. The score between the two teams was tied again at three to three.</p>

<p>Five to Three丨Malaya Wins Continuously</p>
<p>丨Won Two Goals in Ten Minutes丨</p>
<p>In the next ten minutes, Malaya won continuously, scoring two goals and securing the victory. The first of the two goals was scored by Ruan Guoying, thanks to the support of right wing Chen Meian. The second goal was the fault of the Western team's goalkeeper's haste. With a ball in hand, he threw it away. Qiu, the center forward, reaped the benefits and took the lead with five to three.</p>
<p>Five to Four丨Success and Return</p>
<p>丨Welcome Banquet and Tour of the City丨</p>
<p>The Western team was indeed fearsome. In a bad environment, they fought unceasingly. With a slight decision, they used a corner kick, and Huo Gengsheng broke through the defense again. In the end, five to four, Malaya won. At 7 p.m. that night, the Association held a welcome banquet at the Jinling Restaurant. After the banquet, the entire team toured the city.</p>
<p>Chinese Team丨Scheduled for Tomorrow</p>
<p>丨Watch the Two Sides Compete in Strength丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese team, which was preparing to participate in the National Games, was also unable to show its skills due to the suspension of the National Games, which was a pity. Now, it happened that Malaya returned to the country, so they scheduled a match with Malaya at the baseball field at 3 p.m. tomorrow. Both teams had hopes of winning the championship in the National Games, so tomorrow's battle is like winning the national championship.</p>
<p>13th丨Jinan Challenges</p>
<p>丨Malaya's Last Battle in Shanghai丨</p>
<p>Yesterday after the game, Yu Hengzhi, together with Malaya's leader Yu Zhuohua and Jinan's sports director Chen Zhang'e, captain Jiang Shanqing, and secretary Hao Chunde, mutually agreed to a match with the Jinan team on the 13th. This will be Malaya's last battle in Shanghai. They will depart for Hangzhou on the morning of the 14th.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Industries to Promote National Salvation</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce announced: Greetings. On the 4th of this month, we received Official Letter No. 343 from the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, stating that the Publicity Department of the Chamber had submitted a memorandum regarding the fourth item of the expanded publicity conference, which discussed the issue of resisting Japan and saving the nation. This item was a request from the Chamber to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all businesses in the city to affix anti-Japanese slogans to their display windows. The 13th standing committee meeting of the Chamber resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to handle the matter accordingly. On the same day, we also received a letter from the Shanghai University Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, which the Chamber unanimously resolved that all businesses must include anti-Japanese slogans in their various commercial advertisements to promote national salvation in a cost-effective manner. Please investigate and handle this matter accordingly.</p>
<p>The above two resolutions are intended to arouse the national salvation sentiment of the people, so that they are awakened at any time and place and by whatever they see. We should handle them one by one to help the people increase their enthusiasm for national salvation. We hereby send this letter to notify you and request that you start handling the matter immediately. For industries with associations, the various slogans to be used should be properly drafted and determined by the association and issued to the respective industries for affixing. For stores without associations, they should carefully consider and draft appropriate slogans, generally aiming for easy understanding by the public.</p>
<p>Women's Relief Association Telegrams</p>
<p>Petitioning the Central Government to Promote Peaceful Unification</p>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government to Substantially Promote Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Urging Women Nationwide Not to Use Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Municipal Women's Relief Association convened women from all walks of life in the city at the public sports field on the day before yesterday (the 4th) to hold an anti-Japanese national salvation rally. The important telegrams issued by the rally are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Government: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, respectfully. The Japanese troops have invaded the Northeast, repeatedly capturing famous cities. The situation is critical. All comrades of our party are filled with grief and indignation. The whole country unanimously advocates declaring war on Japan. However, the generals in the Northeast still hold on to the policy of non-resistance, and the diplomatic authorities are seeking help from the League of Nations. This policy is incomprehensible. Peaceful unification of our country is not just empty talk. We must abandon past grievances, truly unite, and then we can talk about peaceful unification. As for seeking help from the League of Nations, the countries in the League each have their own interests. How can they offend Japan to help our country? Moreover, the League of Nations has long lost its sense of justice. Otherwise, Korea could have survived on its own, and India could have become independent. Therefore, the League of Nations is not reliable. From now on, in order to ensure our own survival, we must achieve peaceful unification and concentrate the military power of the whole country to resist foreign aggression and alleviate national disasters. We earnestly present our petition, awaiting orders. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: (Omitted above) Since the violent Japanese invasion and occupation of various parts of the Northeast, the news has spread, and all compatriots across the country are filled with anger. Our association leads the people and cannot remain silent. However, the people are poor and the country is weak, and it is difficult to compete with force for a while. After much consideration, the only way to cut off the enemy's lifeline is to boycott enemy goods. Therefore, on October 4th, we held a citywide women's anti-Japanese national salvation rally at the public sports field. At the rally, it was decided to prepare for the establishment of both domestic goods and Japanese goods exhibition halls. The halls will also have a domestic goods introduction agency to instruct the citizens to understand what kinds of domestic goods can be compared to Japanese goods and what kinds of domestic goods can replace Japanese goods. The prices are cheap and the quality is good, and we can also provide agency services at prices lower than the market price. If we intensify our efforts in this way, domestic goods will naturally be able to drive out the position occupied by Japanese goods. On the one hand, we will also persuade the factories to carefully study and imitate all the goods that we lack. However, we must calculate the current small profits, so that the day domestic goods are completed will be the day the boycott of Japanese goods succeeds. In addition, we will organize a propaganda team to specialize in open-air speeches so that everyone can work to resist Japan regularly, in order to achieve the goal of the Japanese army withdrawing from Chinese territory and compensating for losses. The resolution was passed on the spot and unanimously approved. We should present the resolutions of the meeting in writing for your review and approval, and request that you order the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to follow them together to achieve practical results. (Omitted below) Another letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the content is roughly the same. (Omitted)</p>
<p>Telegram to the Whole Country: All female compatriots across the country, The Japanese army violently occupied the eastern provinces, massacred compatriots, and caused countless property losses. It is heartbreaking. The Japanese troops have recently become even more aggressive, eyeing Tianjin and Ping, and even Nanjing and Shanghai. At this critical moment of life and death, how can we, female compatriots across the country, sit and wait for death? The only way to save the country and fulfill our duty is to implement a unified economic severance with Japan on a fixed date to save the country from danger. We earnestly present our petition, awaiting orders.</p>
<p>Shipping News in the Anti-Japanese Voice</p>
<p>Barges Strike: Since the boycott of Japanese goods, Chinese barges have no longer transported Japanese goods. Japanese trading companies in this port, such as Mitsui, International, and Toyo Cotton Spinning Co., Ltd., all use their own cargo barges for transportation. Therefore, Japanese goods can still be loaded on British ships for export. Now, with the outbreak of the anti-Japanese incident, more than 40 cargo barges belonging to Mitsui, International, and Toyo Cotton Spinning have unanimously and voluntarily gone on strike. The boatmen have united and decided not to carry goods for Japanese merchants anymore. The only means of transportation that the Japanese rely on has now completely stopped.</p>
<p>Shantou Rejects Ships: After Hong Kong refused Japanese ships and refused to load and unload Japanese goods, 20,000 tons of Japanese goods were stockpiled in Hong Kong warehouses. Yesterday, the shipping companies received a telegram from Shantou, saying that the port would take the same approach as Hong Kong. The dock workers will not work for Japanese ships. The Nisshin Steamship Company has ordered the Nanhua to stop going to Shantou.</p>

<p>Great China Rubber Factory</p>
<p>Caught Smuggling Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Great China Rubber Factory specializes in using Japanese raw materials and applying a little bit of labor to make galoshes and sell them as domestic goods. Therefore, it has made huge profits of more than one million in a short period of time. Yesterday, someone reported the factory to the Anti-Japanese Association, which sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections. It was found that all the raw materials of the factory, such as rubber powder and lining powder, were inferior Japanese goods. The manager of the factory, Xue Fuji, was immediately detained, along with the account books and documents, and escorted back to the association. More than 20 warehouses of the factory's inventory were sealed up, pending a meeting for disposition.</p>

<p>The Coal Industry Association on the Purchase of Japanese Coal</p>
<p>Reported to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the Coal Industry Association sent a letter yesterday stating: Greetings.

Please open your prices and submit them to the General Affairs Department of our bureau at the Sichuan Road intersection. The bidding will be opened at the bureau on the afternoon of October 15th of the lunar calendar. We will place an order immediately. Special announcement." After investigation, Fushun lump coal is Japanese coal. At this time of national crisis, all our people have unanimously united to sever economic ties and strive to fulfill their duties. What is the intention of the director of the Telegraph Bureau, who dares to openly advertise to purchase Japanese coal? Is he not a traitor? The association believes that nothing less than a severe punishment can appease public anger. We hereby urgently send this letter and request your association to discuss and deal with it immediately to uphold justice.</p>

<h3>Xiong Shihui's Talk</h3>
<p>Commander Xiong's arrival in Shanghai was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is heard that Xiong was very busy in Beijing. Because of the recent rumors in Shanghai, he made a special trip back to Shanghai. He originally planned to return to Beijing last night, but he received a telegram from the central government asking him to stay for a few more days, so he did not make the trip. Xiong went to the headquarters to work at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. It is heard that he will summon the staff for training tomorrow, fearing that the staff will neglect their duties because the central government ordered Chen Mingshu to concurrently serve as the Songhu Garrison Commander due to the Guangdong issue. Xiong spoke to reporters yesterday, and the records are as follows:</p>
<p>There have been many rumors in Shanghai in the past few days. Japanese residents and Chinese people in Zhabei have moved out one after another. Japanese residents are afraid of attacks by Chinese people, and Chinese people are afraid of attacks by Japanese troops. The mutual discord is entirely due to misunderstandings. The Chinese people's patriotic movement is law-abiding and will never take any action against ordinary Japanese residents. Therefore, Japanese residents can rest assured. The situation in Shanghai is different from that in Shenyang. Japan will not treat Shanghai the same way it treated Shenyang. However, some people deliberately spread rumors, such as what a certain Western newspaper reported today, saying that the Japanese consul had sent a letter to Mayor Zhang, saying that the Chinese government was unable to protect Japanese residents and that he would send troops to protect them himself. Mayor Zhang did not receive this letter. This is what I know. What the Western newspaper said is ridiculous. I believe that the Chinese local government in Shanghai has declared that it is responsible for protecting Japanese residents, and there will be no accidents. Several Japanese warships have arrived in Shanghai. In Japan, it is said that they came to reassure Japanese residents. However, this has aroused the resentment of the Chinese people. But if Japan wants to capture Songhu, they may not believe that the current military strength is sufficient. Therefore, there will be no accidents in Shanghai. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>To Report the Situation in Shanghai to Chiang</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun took the express train to Beijing at 3:15 p.m. yesterday to report the security situation in Shanghai to Chairman Chiang. It is heard that Zhang will stay in Beijing for a day or two and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Deliberately Spread Panic</h3>
<p>Chinese People Should Adopt Legitimate Defense</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that rumors suddenly arose in this port the day before yesterday (the 6th), causing students from various schools in Jiangwan to be excused from school by their parents. The atmosphere was very tense for a time, and residents in Zhabei were even more alarmed and moved to the concessions one after another. The rumors were especially rampant in the evening. However, it is heard that the rumors were actually caused by the Japanese navy setting up armed sentries in the areas outside the boundaries of the northwestern part of North Sichuan Road, causing panic among the citizens.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Moreover, that area had already been recovered by our government. Although it was permissible to set up sentries to protect overseas Chinese in very tense times, there have been no incidents in this port recently that were unfavorable to Japanese overseas Chinese. Therefore, they were alarmed by the situation. In the evening, they secretly deployed Marine Corps soldiers in the vicinity, causing unrest among the Chinese. Yesterday, it was heard that the Public Security Bureau had reported to the Municipal Government to negotiate with them to avoid misunderstandings. However, by last night, the rumors seemed to have subsided slightly and were not as serious as the day before.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Middle and Elementary School Teachers and Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent a letter stating that in the past two days, it has been rumored that Japan is preparing to occupy the north and south of the two cities. The atmosphere is tense, and people are panicking. There are many people moving and relocating. Some say that this is a rumor and not worth worrying about. If so, it is certainly desirable. However, the Japanese are cunning and deceitful. How can we guarantee that they will not do anything? As evidenced by the Shenyang incident, they lined up to deploy defenses and set up electric nets, yet they declared that it was to prevent theft. We must give this kind of action deep consideration. Otherwise, once something happens suddenly, we will be at a loss and allow ourselves to be trampled on. The officials responsible for this port must also take this into account. Otherwise, the north and south of the two cities will be lost under the five words of calmness and non-resistance. I believe that defending the territory and governing the people, legitimate defense, is indispensable. Although weak countries have no justice, we absolutely cannot express our self-defense and be labeled as a standard of opposition. I believe that the civil and political parties in this port must quickly find a way to defend themselves. On the one hand, the government is responsible for announcing the self-defense policy to both Chinese and foreigners. If the Japanese have no indication of change, we can guarantee the safety of Japanese residents in the Chinese area. If the Japanese take any action, we vow to take legitimate defense. In this way, we will not be caught off guard and await death, nor will they take the opportunity to make excuses. May we all pay attention to this, which may not be a way to prevent trouble before it happens.</p>
<p>Ke Yinhang, Fei Xindun Requested the Japanese Consul</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to the Security of the Concession</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Promised Not to Expand the Situation</p>
<p>However, Requesting Restrictions on the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>The recent dispatch of warships to Shanghai by Japan has caused panic among people from all walks of life. Although it is the result of self-disturbance by fools and the creation of rumors by a group of troublemakers, the various demonstrations by Japanese sailors in recent days, as well as the spreading of rumors by Japanese personnel, are indeed worthy of attention. This time, the Japanese warships came to Shanghai entirely at the arrogant request of the Japanese residents in Shanghai. Since the anti-Japanese patriotic movement in Shanghai, they have been racking their brains almost every day, holding secret meetings in the Japanese Club on Peng Road. The Shanghai Public Concession Bureau has long been paying attention to this. The day before yesterday, after the Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui came to Shanghai and discussed security matters with Mayor Zhang and others, the Director of the Concession Bureau, Fei Xindun, also convened Chinese and foreign directors to discuss this matter. As a result, Director Fei, after consulting with the leader of the consular body, the US Consul General Ke Yinhang, requested the Japanese consul to pay attention to the security of the entire Shanghai area and informed him that the lives and property of Japanese residents in the Chinese area were fully protected by the Chinese side, and the Concession Bureau was responsible for those in the concession. He advised the Japanese side not to disturb themselves in order to facilitate security. It is heard that the Japanese side has promised to do its best to restrain itself and will not expand the situation. However, it requested that the Concession authorities crack down on the anti-Japanese patriotic movement of the Chinese people, and also asked Ke and Fei to forward the request to our authorities to impose restrictions. Therefore, the security of Shanghai can be guaranteed to be completely worry-free.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Reports</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the Concession Bureau</h3>
<p>Do Our Best to Maintain the Security of the Concession</p>
<p>Strictly Maintain Neutrality in the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News stated that the Japanese newspapers in this port have criticized the Public Concession Bureau for not prohibiting the detention of Japanese goods. According to reliable sources, the criticism of the Japanese newspapers is unfounded. The Concession Bureau must strictly maintain neutrality in this Sino-Japanese dispute and cannot favor any side. The responsibility of the Concession Bureau is to protect the lives and property of residents in the concession, regardless of their nationality. The Concession Bureau is now doing its best to fulfill this responsibility. As for the detention of Japanese goods, nothing has been heard of it so far. Or there may be one or two unimportant and minor detention incidents. ○</p>
<p>But it must be known that the area of the concession is very large. The Concession Bureau cannot send patrols to guard every place where Japanese goods are sold or stored. At present, the hearts of Chinese and Japanese residents are extremely agitated. The Concession Bureau is strictly maintaining neutrality and maintaining law and order at all times.</p>
<h3>Warships of Various Countries Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great Powers Increase Their Naval Presence in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since Japan sent a squadron of twenty-four destroyers to Shanghai, the situation has become more tense than before. There are now seven Japanese warships in the Huangpu River, and the Ministry of the Navy will order the 9,885-ton special service ship Tokiwa to transport 400 members of the Yokosuka Naval Corps to Shanghai. The Tokiwa has four 200mm caliber guns and fourteen 150mm caliber guns. This ship is about to come to Shanghai. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy are paying close attention to the arrival of Japanese warships. The British and American East Asian Fleets have also increased their naval presence in Shanghai recently. The United States has dispatched another ship, the Heston, to Shanghai. There are currently fifteen foreign warships in the Huangpu River. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3>Tax Police Platoon Leader Suicide</h3>
<p>Kang Baosen's Bitter Resentment of Violent Japan</p>
<p>A Far East News Agency report states that Kang Baosen, the third platoon leader of the first company of the second battalion of the Finance Ministry's tax police regiment, recently transferred from Bengbu to Shanghai, was a Liaoning native and a graduate of the Northeast Military Academy. Recently, due to the Japanese army's forcible occupation of the three northeastern provinces, he felt extreme indignation. Furthermore, considering that the authorities showed no sign of sending troops, he became even more agitated. Yesterday, at 1:30 PM, Platoon Leader Kang suddenly shot himself in the head with a pistol at the Longhua Garrison Headquarters. The bullet entered through the face and exited through the back of the head, causing profuse bleeding. The adjutant's office immediately sent someone to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, where he was admitted to a second-class ward. He died from his severe injuries at around 4:00 PM. When the tragic news reached Longhua, officers and soldiers were deeply saddened. At the same time, Yang Zhengze, the second platoon leader of the same company, witnessed Kang's condition and was overcome with grief and indignation. The company commander, to prevent any untoward incidents, has dispatched personnel to keep watch.</p>

<h3>Guangxi Fellow Provincial Association's Telegram Advocates</h3>
<p>Abandon Past Grievances</p>
<p>Save the Country Through Peace</p>
<p>Telegram to Beijing and Guangdong: To Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Yu Youren, Mr. Hu Zhantang, and Mr. Dai Jitao in Nanjing; and Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Zhang Puquan, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Gu Xiangqin, and Mr. Li Delin in Guangzhou, Greetings. As national peril is imminent, it is fitting to unite against a common enemy. Internal strife among brothers should cease to resist foreign aggression. Since the loss of Liaoning and Jilin, the people's spirit has been greatly aroused, and the call for resistance against Japan has resounded throughout the country. It is incumbent upon you gentlemen, who have dedicated yourselves to the Party and the country, to lead the people and defend the nation. Now that the enemy troops are crossing the river, is it a time for leisurely discussion? You should quickly abandon past grievances, save the country through peace, respect public opinion, gather military resources, vigorously pursue revolutionary diplomacy, and recover lost territories within a specified time. It is imperative to prevent the violent Japanese from implementing their continental policy and to ensure the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty. The millions of people of Guangxi pledge to follow the lead of the nation and spare no sacrifice to fight for the survival of the country and the nation. The situation is critical and urgent, and we can only hope for a swift resolution. The Guangxi Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai for Anti-Japanese National Salvation, Yang.</p>
<p>Telegram to Guangxi: To Mr. Li Delin and Mr. Bai Jiansheng in Wuzhou; and to all division, brigade, and regimental commanders, government agencies, organizations, and newspapers, Greetings. The violent Japanese have seized our three provinces in Liaodong, creating unprecedented shame at home and abroad. The people of all regions have expressed their grief and fervent resolve, unanimously deciding to fight to the end and willing to be at the forefront. The brave men of Guangxi once advanced up the Xiang River to pacify the Central Plains and crossed the Yellow and Luo Rivers to secure the northern frontier. Their revolutionary achievements shine brightly throughout the universe. At this time of national crisis, it is especially important to inspire morale and jointly save the nation from danger. The people pay taxes to support the army, and the soldiers wield their weapons to defend the country. We are all Chinese, treading the same Chinese soil and doing the same Chinese work. Sacrificing homes and exhausting resources, our duty is beyond question. The Duke of Fan Wenzheng once said: "One should focus on the big picture and let go of the details, prioritize the urgent over the slow, and benefit the country without seeking personal gain." Please recite this to our armed comrades and elders of Guangxi. These are our sorrowful and indignant words, and we hope for your consideration. The Guangxi Fellow Provincial Association in Shanghai for Anti-Japanese National Salvation, Yang.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Unauthorized Rice Levies for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Provincial Order for the Department of Civil Affairs to Investigate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Grain Industry Trade Association received a reply from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating: "In response to your letter of September 28, which forwarded a telegram from the Wuxi Rice Grain Shipping Industry Association stating that the Liyang County Government had improperly acceded to the request of the disaster relief branch to levy rice donations, which hindered the people's food supply, and requested a transfer to cancel it, we immediately telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering a strict investigation and prohibition. Now, we have received a substitute telegram No. 1334, which reads: 'The substitute telegram has been noted. The county magistrate's unauthorized levy of rice donations without prior approval is indeed inappropriate. In addition to ordering the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate and report for review, you are hereby notified accordingly.' Therefore, we have recorded the telegram and hope that you will investigate and notify accordingly."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Burma Raise White Rice for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>This time, various provinces in our country have been hit by floods, and wails of despair are heard everywhere. Overseas Chinese abroad are deeply concerned and look inward. Places such as the Philippines, Singapore, Java, and Siam are all enthusiastically donating and raising funds to be remitted here. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Business Association in Burma raised 2,500 bags of white rice, and the Yangon Sideris Rice Company raised 1,500 bags of white rice, estimated to be worth about 43,000 taels of silver. Yesterday, it was transported to Shanghai by the Dirahwa liner. This righteous grain and benevolent act is deeply admirable. In addition to the National Government's Flood Relief Committee designating 2,000 bags for Yuezhou and 2,000 bags for Funing to be distributed in the disaster areas to help the people's food supply and issuing official receipts directly to the above-mentioned two groups and publishing thank-you notices in the newspapers, the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese in raising relief funds and their righteous reputation spreading far and wide is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Implementation Plan for Guaranteeing Cattle Loans and Seeds: The Association, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, the Jiangsu Flood Emergency Relief Association, and the Jiangbei Flood Temporary Relief Association, held a joint meeting on the 1st of this month. Commissioner He Yushu proposed that the relief agencies assist the Department of Agriculture in handling cattle loan and seed matters. It was resolved that the Department of Agriculture would directly consult with the two relief associations to handle the matter. It is reported that the Association had previously sent letters to the county offices and bureaus, asking them to consult with local officials and gentry on the matter of protecting livestock and provide appropriate subsidies based on their remaining resources, depending on the severity of the disaster in each county. The matter of providing seed loans is also being planned.</p>
<p>The Fourth District of Dongtai Begs for Relief and Appeals: The Association recently received a plea for relief from the Disaster Relief Committee of the Fourth District of Dongtai, which has been stricken by floods. The original text is extracted below: "The Fourth District is located downstream of the three counties of Tai, Dong, and Xing, with a low-lying terrain, serving as the final outlet for western waters into the sea. This summer's torrential rains have caused a disaster, with all three dams releasing water simultaneously, resulting in floods flowing horizontally, turning the entire Fourth District into a marsh. Furthermore, the dikes and sluices of the Yancheng Reclamation Company blocked the waterways, preventing drainage, causing water accumulation in the district, with a source but no outlet, causing great harm. Since the breaches of the You and Shao dams, the water surged down, and the water level in the Fourth District suddenly increased by several feet, coupled with strong winds and rapid currents, causing the surrounding dikes in various villages to collapse one after another, without exception. The vast expanse of water submerged the entire territory. The autumn grains, which were about to be harvested, were completely submerged, and the houses were also washed away. Cries of despair echoed through the fields, with no way to seek help. The most tragic were the elderly and weak, who had no time to escape, and countless people died. The young and strong were either , or , with no food during the day and no light at night, sleeping in the wind, awaiting death helplessly. Corpses floated, and livestock wandered, making the scene unbearable to witness. This catastrophic disaster is unprecedented. Although the colleagues of our Association have rushed to various villages by boat to do their best to rescue and resettle some people, or send them out of the affected area, the disaster is too large, and rescue cannot keep up. The future is long, and it is difficult to maintain. The Fourth District is located on the coast and is known for its poverty, coupled with frequent famines. At this time, raising relief donations is extremely difficult. Even if there are a few donations, they are like a drop in the bucket, unable to help in the slightest. Looking at the ocean and sighing, we can only cry in vain. But remembering the tens of thousands of dying disaster victims, groaning in the midst of the great flood, emaciated and waiting to be fed, if we do not urgently seek proper solutions, they will surely fill the ditches. We, the colleagues, witness this and feel heartbroken. Therefore, we make this appeal on their behalf, earnestly requesting charitable organizations and generous philanthropists to have compassion for those who are hungry and drowning, and to work together to achieve effective results. Whether it is dry food, the more the better, or relief donations, may they come continuously. May your kindness spread far and wide, and may you provide support and assistance. Then the disaster victims will be grateful and remember your kindness forever. Our Association respectfully bows nine times on behalf of the disaster victims."</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Reports from Anhui and Guangdong Provinces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces received a reply telegram from Lin Yunzhai, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, on the 5th, stating: "Your telegram of winter has been noted. We have ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to distribute it to the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce and the Guangdong Flood Relief Association for handling, and to report the handling situation to the Department for verification. We hereby reply by telegram for your information. Lin Yunzhai, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, bows slightly."</p>
<p>The Association also received a substitute telegram from Xu Pingxuan, Director of Southern Anhui Disaster Relief, sent from Huaining, stating: "According to the report from Yang Jianquan, a relief worker in Huaining, Jianquan has been consulting with the Huaining County Magistrate and various organizations on the method of investigation and distribution in recent days. In addition to Liu Yangnong, Wu Yangnan, and others being responsible for conducting on-site investigations of extremely poor households in Guangjiwei and other places to prepare registration and distribute relief tickets, Jianquan is responsible for Shibei and other places. I have been ordered to go to Taikoo Wharf to receive the rice and flour transported to Anhui, and I have checked and received them clearly. Please send guards from Huaining County to watch over them. However, the Taikoo Wuhu ship arrived in the province at 11:00 PM on the 26th. It was at night, and it was in the middle of the river, which was very dangerous because there were no barges and the wind and currents were very strong. The boatmen took the opportunity to extort money, resulting in huge expenses. The rice and flour have now been divided into two ships and are anchored at Shanmuzhou, with a daily ship cost of nine yuan. Please telegraph Tongcheng immediately to rush the transportation of 2,000 bags of flour to save expenses. Jianquan will go to Shibei to investigate and distribute. In addition to reporting the handling situation after arriving in the town and notifying Liu Yangnong and others to investigate and report as soon as possible, I hereby report in advance." In addition to telegraphing Tongcheng to rush the transportation, we hereby report accordingly.</p>
<h3>Disaster Victims in Xinghua Beg for Clothing</h3>
<p>The Clothing Relief Association at No. 207 West Maude Road, Shanghai Race Club, received a telegram from the Xinghua Relief Branch stating: "The great flood reaches the sky, and wails of despair fill the land. The autumn wind is severe, with no clothing and no food. We respectfully bow to your Association on behalf of the 600,000 disaster victims, begging for your compassionate lifeline. Please grant a large amount of clothing as soon as possible, so that those who are about to die can share the bed and mat. Your merits are immeasurable. Looking forward to your telegram, we cannot express our gratitude enough. Sun Jinglong and others of the Xinghua Relief Branch bow and send their regards. Feng Dafu, the Fengjing collection point, shipped 720 pieces of clothing yesterday. More than 700 pieces were also donated to the Association in this port."</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation</p>
<h3>Northwest Line Trial Flight Period</h3>
<p>The Areas Flown Over Are Still Peaceful</p>
<p>Gasoline Must Be Transferred from Ping</p>
<p>Trial Flight Possible in Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jingcong's Talk</p>
<p>A reporter from the Daily News visited Mr. Li Jingcong, Director of the Operations Group of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, yesterday. According to him, the company's new Northwest route has been in preparation for a long time. The route flies through Zhengzhou, Shanzhou, Xi'an, Pingliang, Lanzhou, Liangzhou, Ganzhou, Suzhou, Anxi, Hami, and Urumqi, directly to the endpoint of Yining in Xinjiang. The company is sponsored by the Ministry of Communications. Matters such as the transportation situation in each area, whether there are motor roads and other roads, whether the locality is peaceful, whether there is a flat ground of 300 meters in length and width, whether there are obstacles around the flat ground, and whether gasoline for aircraft use can be purchased locally are of great importance to flight. The company has telegraphed the governments of the four provinces of Yu, Shan, Gan, and Xin to request a detailed investigation. Now, it is reported that the provinces of Yu and Shan have replied to the Ministry. Mr. Li saw the reply telegram in Beijing, which stated that the area was generally peaceful, but gasoline could not be purchased. This telegram has not yet been formally transferred to the company. As for the provinces of Xin and Gan, due to inconvenient transportation, mail and telegrams are sent slowly, and it is not yet known whether the Ministry's telegram has been received. Recently, the company has been actively preparing for a trial flight and has decided to purchase gasoline and transfer it from Beiping to GuiSui and other places for use. The gasoline is expected to arrive in various places at the beginning of next month at the earliest, and a new type of aircraft can be dispatched for the first trial flight in mid-month. After the trial flight is successful, business will begin. At that time, the provincial governments can transfer orders to military and political organs to protect the route along the way.</p>
<h3>Customs Cracks Down on the Transport of Silver Small Coins</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Promulgates Seven Measures for Circulation</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the currency policy and facilitate merchants and the people, the Ministry of Finance has synthesized past cases and taken into account the current situation to formulate seven measures to crack down on the transportation of silver small coins, so as to unify the policy and facilitate implementation. All previous orders issued by the old Ministry of Finance in Beiping and the former Currency Bureau prohibiting transportation should be uniformly canceled, effective from the first day of this month. The Jianghai Customs has received this Ministry order and has implemented it since the first day of this month. The measures are recorded below: (1) Whenever inferior and lightweight small coins privately cast for profit-making purposes are found at various checkpoints, they shall be handled in accordance with these measures. (2) Before the implementation of the Currency Law, single silver small coins with a total weight of 7.2 li in Kuping (Treasury Standard), equivalent to 0.504 mace of pure silver, and double silver small coins with a total weight of 1.44 qian, equivalent to 1.08 mace of pure silver, shall be temporarily allowed to circulate according to local customs. (3) Regardless of whether single or double silver small coins do not meet the weight and fineness of the previous item, they shall be considered inferior and lightweight coins. (4) All inferior and lightweight coins found shall be melted into silver. After deducting transportation and melting expenses, 20% shall be turned over to the government, and 20% of the government funds shall be used for awards. The remaining silver shall be returned to the original transporter for collection. (5) All non-inferior and lightweight coins, whether single or double, in amounts less than 500 coins, shall be allowed for merchants to transport freely, and shall be released after inspection by various Jianghai Customs. If the amount exceeds 500 coins, a passport must be obtained from the Customs Superintendency of the place of shipment before they can be transported. (6) When issuing passports, the Customs Superintendency of each customs shall first ascertain the reported quantity, type, and destination of the goods, and clearly state them in the passport. (7) If the Customs finds silver small coins transported without a passport or in excess of the amount specified in the passport, except for inferior and lightweight coins, which shall be melted and handed over to the government according to the above item, if they are non-inferior and lightweight coins, 3% shall be used for awards, and the remainder shall be returned.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Festival</p>
<h3>Meal Expenses Transferred to Patriotic Donations</h3>
<p>Initiated by Employees of the Yingchang Factory</p>
<p>Other Factories and Stores Can Emulate</p>
<p>The entire staff of the Shanghai Yingchang Factory of the Great China Match Company in Pudong, in view of the ongoing national crisis, specifically resolved the other day to suspend the meal for the Double Tenth Festival and deposit all meal expenses of more than 100 yuan into the Pudong Bank for future use as patriotic donations.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Industry Bank</p>
<h3>Received Business License</h3>
<p>Self-Built Five-Story Building</p>
<p>Has Already Started Business</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Commercial Savings Bank, organized by the tycoons of the silk industry and the financial sector in this city, has been formally established. The bank has submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the bank registration regulations and implementation rules for registration and licensing. After more than a month, the bank received Business License No. 99 from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, specializing in deposits, loans, mortgages, discounts, remittances, savings, and other businesses. The bank has now selected a site at the corner of Fujian Road and Hankou Road as its address and is building a five-story building. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The temporary business office is temporarily located on the third floor of No. 349 Ningbo Road. The opening will take place as soon as the new building is completed.</p>
<h3>Opening of He Hing Wharf and Warehouse Company</h3>
<p>Mr. Yue Zhenbao, Mr. Lu Bohong, Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang, Mr. Wang Yunfu, and Mr. Yu Baoqing, all Shanghai gentlemen, in view of the development of shipping since the recovery of our country's autonomy, which has progressed rapidly, and the fact that the original wharves in this port were all old-fashioned and insufficient to meet current needs, raised funds to purchase more than 80 mu of land in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, to build three steel floating wharves and a state-of-the-art three-story steel-concrete warehouse, which can store 200,000 packages of groceries. The terrain is higher than Puxi (Pudong), and the water depth is very deep, with a water depth of more than 20 feet even at the lowest tide. Large and small ships can be berthed at any time. The drawings were planned by Mr. Gu Daosheng of the Gongli Business Company, making it the most complete wharf and warehouse in this port. It opened yesterday. The company provided a special boat to transport guests, and more than a thousand people from all walks of life successively went to visit. They were warmly received by the managers and guided to see various departments, all of whom expressed satisfaction. Tea and snacks were also provided, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Baoyu Lane Rent Increase Concession</p>
<p>After the Dehe Foreign Firm, the landlord of Baoyu Lane on Route Edward VII in the French Concession, announced that the rent would be increased by 30% across the board from November 1, the tenants were panicked and organized a Tenants' Union to send a letter to the Dehe Foreign Firm requesting that the order to increase rent be withdrawn. It has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper that the Dehe Foreign Firm has inquired about the tenants' request and reduced the rent increase for houses along the road by 10%, and for residents in the lane by half. Mr. Chen was dispatched by the firm to reply orally. However, the tenants of the lane believe that the commercial situation is grim and the market is panicking to the extreme. The cost of rice is as precious as pearls, and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon. The rent that the tenants usually bear is already barely enough to make ends meet. They want to follow in the footsteps of Zhizhong, Shixian, Yuqing and other lanes in this concession and demand a rent reduction (Zhizhong and other lanes have already implemented rent reductions), how can they bear any more burden? The tenants are now preparing to send a letter to the Dehe Foreign Firm again, making a second request, in order to cancel the rent increase proposal and to help merchants in difficulty.</p>
<p>Male Corpse on the Riverside in Lujiazui</p>
<h3>Sixteen-Character Last Words</h3>
<p>Bad Environment, Economic Oppression</p>
<p>Taking This Approach, There Is No Other Reason</p>
<p>The No. 2 patrol boat of the Tongren Fuyuantang Rescue Bureau found a male drowning corpse on the riverside in Lujiazui, Pudong, at around 1:00 PM yesterday. The corpse was about 30 years old. After the corpse was recovered, it was observed that the corpse was wearing a gray striped Serge long gown, a black floral satin padded jacket, gray crepe gauze padded pants, a white flannel short shirt, red willow-patterned foreign cloth single pants, a white Xiangyun waistband, purple thread socks, and navy blue serge shoes, with gray silk ribbons to tie the feet. Two cards were found beside him, one for Qian Fengyi, barrister at Law, Fessenden Road, No. 3 Xinkang Lane, Jiangxi Road, and one with the words Yan Diling, Xi Jiu, Guangrao, etc. There was also a 10% off coupon from the Kuaihuo Lin Food Company for the Bingyin year, and a piece of paper with the words "Bad environment, economic oppression, taking this approach, there is no other reason" written in blue ink. It was then known that the man had committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. He was immediately taken back to the bureau in Nanmatou for coffining and recognition according to regulations.</p>
<h3>The Massive Sandalwood Theft Case at the Okura Warehouse</h3>
<p>A major theft occurred at the Okura warehouse in Pudong last month. The stolen items were twenty pieces of sandalwood, imported from India and stored at the warehouse, of considerable value. Upon discovering the theft, it was found that the doors and windows around the warehouse were untouched. It remains unknown how such large cargo was moved in and out. The warehouse immediately issued a loss report and reported it to the First Sub-Bureau of the Third District, requesting assistance in tracking down the stolen goods. The sub-bureau then reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which issued a general order to all district offices to investigate. On the 2nd of this month, detectives from the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that the stolen goods had been purchased by the Yi Cheng Ning Cargo Company at the Zhuhang Wharf in the Southern City. Zhu Haifan, the owner of the company, found it inconvenient to store such a large quantity of goods in his company, so he transported them to the Fengtai Grain Store, opened by his elder brother Zhu Haishan near Sanguantang on Zhaojia Road in the Western Gate, for storage and gradual sale. The detectives immediately went to the address, detained Zhu Haifan, and then went to the Fengtai store, where they apprehended Zhu Haishan and a store employee named Wu Zhumei. Knowing that the matter was exposed, Zhu Haishan handed over four burlap sacks of sandalwood, but these were not the original stolen goods, but rather an attempt to cover up the crime. The detectives brought the suspects to the team, where after preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, they were transferred to the First Sub-Bureau of the Third District in Pudong for interrogation. On the previous day, detectives from the same team learned that a batch of stolen goods from the case had been sold by the Zhu Haifan and Zhu Haishan brothers to the Yuan Yu Yong Hardware and Sundries Store on Limadu Road in the Southern City. They immediately reported this information to the team leader, who immediately dispatched Inspector Li Wenmo to go to the Yuan Yu Yong store with the Chief of the First District General Office to inquire with the store manager, Pu Ruihe, whether the store had purchased sandalwood. Pu claimed that the store had been established for many years and had a solid reputation, and would never buy goods of unknown origin. Inspector Li and others did not pursue the matter. Before long, they suddenly discovered two burlap sacks of the original stolen sandalwood, totaling fourteen large pieces (each piece worth over one hundred yuan), among the piles of sundry goods in the store. They immediately seized the goods and questioned Pu. Pu's face turned pale, and he remained silent. They detained Pu and took him and the recovered stolen goods back to the team. During the preliminary hearing, Pu confessed that he was forty years old and from Wuxi. He claimed that the sandalwood was acquired through a broker named Shao Fulin and that Yi Cheng Company had issued an invoice. He insisted that he was momentarily confused, leading him to receive the stolen goods. Considering the severity of the theft, they were instructed to prepare a written report and transfer the suspect and stolen goods to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Bestiality Case: Imprisonment for Three Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>Mao Xingfu, a 20-year-old man from Jiangbei, broke into the Gongda Yarn Factory workshop at 252 Huasheng Road around 8 PM on the 29th of last month. He forcibly raped Sun Lanying, an 18-year-old woman from Taixing. In the early hours, the woman's cousin, Ji Ruicheng, confronted Mao, leading to a fight. Chinese detectives Zhang Yunjian and Liu Changgen from the Yangshupu Police Station arrested both Mao and Ji and handed them over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen presided over the Third Criminal Court, sentencing Mao Xingfu to three years and six months of imprisonment. The number of days spent in detention before the judgment is finalized will be credited at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Ji Ruicheng was fined five yuan with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Suspects in the Murder of Hart</h3>
<p>Planning Another Robbery in Pudong</p>
<p>Awaiting Transfer by the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month at 5 PM, Detective Li Xiaobao of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Zhang Zhangsheng, a thief from Pudong, on Zhongshan Road. A loaded handgun was found on him. He confessed that his accomplice, Yao Jinxiang, from Jiangbei, was hiding at No. 111 Taopeng Road, Yangshupu. The day before yesterday, Li asked the Yangshupu Police Station for assistance in arresting him. The police chief dispatched Chinese detective Liu Changsheng and Western detective Hyde to secretly arrest him. They found nothing. Later, Yao was arrested at the First Floor Teahouse at No. 675 on the same road. Li Zhang, a woman from Pudong (Zhang Chengsheng's sister), was also taken into the police station for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated that Yao Jinxiang and Zhang Zhangsheng were involved in the murder of a Westerner named Hart (an employee of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board) on the Bund on May 30th of last year. When Zhang Zhangsheng was arrested, he and Yao Jinxiang were planning to rob somewhere in Pudong. Zhang Zhangsheng also confessed at the police station that the handgun had been hidden at his sister Li Zhang's place in the past, and that she had instructed him to go to Pudong for robbery that day. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest of the two defendants. Detective Ji Xiaobao of the Municipal Public Security Bureau recounted the circumstances of Zhang's arrest. Zhang Zhangsheng testified that he was not involved in the case of killing the Westerner. The handgun was given to him by Zhang Along, who was on the run, to be stored at his sister Li Zhang's place. His remaining statements were evasive. Yao Jinxiang confessed that he had borrowed money from Zhang Zhangsheng before, but he was not involved in theft. Li Zhang confessed that her brother Zhang Zhangsheng asked her to borrow money but she did not have it, so she falsely claimed that someone wanted to buy a handgun and that he could sell it to get money. She tricked him to go halfway where he was arrested by detectives from the Public Security Bureau. She denied any involvement in the planned robbery in Pudong, and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao Xie-fen verified the confessions and ordered them to be detained separately, awaiting the Municipal Public Security Bureau to prepare a document and transfer them back to the case for further investigation.</p>

<p>Huang Chunquan Accuses Chen Laowu of Three Crimes</p>
<p>Huang Chunquan, a native of Shaoxing who works in the paper industry and currently resides above the Shengli Copper Bed Store at Hongxingli on Beijing Road, filed a complaint because he was impoverished, had many children, and could not make a living. Furthermore, under the influence of a bad environment, in August of the 17th year of the Republic, he, through an intermediary, sent his 13-year-old daughter, Yousheng, to Chen Laowu's brothel, Leyuli on Guangxi Road, to learn to sing. Unexpectedly, Chen Laowu, greedy for the "缠头" [red envelope money], recently ordered Yousheng to receive guests for prostitution and hid Yousheng. She even went to Huang Chunquan's house and falsely accused Chunquan of hiding her, causing trouble. Chunquan then filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing her of three crimes: endangering morals, family, and freedom. He requested legal remedy and asked that she be punished according to the law for all three crimes. Yesterday, Judge Feng presided over the Second Criminal Court. First, the plaintiff testified as above. Next, Chinese constable No. 1281 stated that the summons was delivered to the defendant, but after she read it, she threw it back and refused to receive it, failing to appear in court. Judge Feng then ordered that the defendant be arrested and brought to court for trial on the afternoon of the 14th of this month.</p>

<p>Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Relief Association, and Wu Rongsheng, a detective from the Water Patrol, boarded the Shuntian steamer yesterday and found a young woman who was very beautiful and fashionably dressed.

She claimed her name was Zhou Peifen, from Nanxiang, and that her husband, Wang Xingsheng, worked as a partner in the Daoxiangcun in Tianjin and had been gone for many years. While they were questioning her, a man from Tianjin named Yan Guizhen came over and claimed that she was the wife of his friend and that he had sent her on the ship. He asked them not to question her. The investigators asked him where her husband was, and he claimed that he was shopping ashore. When asked the name of the woman's husband, he suddenly stared blankly and did not answer, his statements contradictory. They wanted to arrest him, but he had already escaped. They identified him as a trafficker and arrested the woman as well and took them both to the police station for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5 PM, Wang Guisheng, the owner of the Wang Shengji Truck Company on Jessfield Road, Shanghai West, drove his truck, No. 3794, to Fanhangdu to visit friends. He parked the truck on the side of the road opposite the lumberyard. Unexpectedly, after Wang got out of the truck, his relative Xu Rongsheng, only 17 years old, got into the truck and, playing around, turned on the engine.

<h3>Chen Shaokuan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Director of the Naval Academy and concurrently Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. According to what Chen told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, Minister Yang has not yet set a date to go to Nanjing due to the extended Fourth Plenary Session. In this port area, due to various rumors from the outside, the defenses are stricter than usual. Currently moored in the port are seven or eight ships, including the Yong Sui, Chu Tai, Yong Jian, Chen Zi, Ding An, and Hua An. Each port along the Yangtze River has these ships. The people's morale is indeed high, but it can be maintained by remaining calm. As long as the central government negotiates, there is no fear of not achieving victory. There is indeed hope for peace in Guangzhou, but the matter is being handled by the central government, so the details are not known. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Chen went to the aircraft station and various ships under construction for inspection. It is said that due to urgent ministerial affairs, he will return to Nanjing that night. The rumors circulating outside the night before last that the Japanese navy was plotting to occupy Gaochangmiao were unfounded, as everything was peaceful as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Called by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Record of the National Products Manufacturers' Congress</h3>
<p>Letter Sent to Five National Products Associations</p>
<p>Great Cooperative Organization</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened the All-Shanghai National Products Manufacturers' Congress. Attendees included over a hundred companies, such as Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, China Apple Factory, Hua Mao Cap Store, Wuzhou Soap Factory, China Chemical Industrial Society, Sanyou Industrial Society, Samsung Cotton Iron Factory, Da Zhonghua Match Factory, and others, with several hundred representatives in total, making it a grand occasion. Chairman Wang Wanju presided over the meeting, Zhong Jinzhen recorded the minutes, and the ceremony proceeded as usual. First, Chairman Wang stated, "Today, our chamber convened the All-Shanghai National Products Manufacturers' Congress. I am very honored to have all of you present. I, in my capacity as Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will briefly present the reasons for convening this meeting to all the representatives. Our chamber, in view of Japan taking advantage of our natural disasters and banditry to brazenly send troops, occupy Yuaning, seize the East Railway, kill our people, and plunder our wealth, and not satisfied with even that, dispatching warships to spy on fortresses in various provinces and landing to demonstrate, their ambition and brutality is causing global outrage. Our people feel the pain firsthand. When the bad news came, everyone was shocked and sought ways to restrain themselves and devise plans for retaliation. Our national products merchants, whose duty is to promote national products to stem the leakage of wealth, have a great relationship with this national crisis. This is the purpose of today's congress. Recently, various newspapers have revealed detailed information about Japan's actions and the diplomatic situation, and public opinion is boiling. I believe all the representatives are already aware of this. But if we investigate the reason, Japan has an excessive population and increasing unemployment. Furthermore, in recent years, our country's citizens have gradually awakened. They anticipate that in a few years, our country's national products will sell well, and Japanese trade in China will inevitably plummet. Therefore, they use a preemptive strategy to wantonly destroy. Their premeditation is not a matter of a day or two. After this incident, fortunately, our people united in their efforts and expressed thorough and painful sentiments. For example, at the previous All-Shanghai Citizens' Congress, the number of attendees reached over 100,000, an unprecedented number in Shanghai. If we can consistently implement this unity to the end, it will be enough to make the Japanese feel cold. We merchants can only adhere to the principle of 'speaking commerce from a commercial standpoint' and think from the perspective of merchants. Although our country's commerce has made some progress in recent years, it is simply impossible to compare with Japan, the United States, and other countries. We, who are responsible for promoting national products, from now on, should strive to improve the manufacturing of goods, the sourcing of raw materials, the selection of quality, the research on decoration, the assessment of prices, and the convenience of use. We must firmly adhere to the principle of truthfulness and not have such malpractices as mixing inferior goods with superior ones or selling inferior goods at high prices, which would lead to the loss of morality and the decline of credibility, and become an obstacle to the future of national products. This is what our chamber hopes for, first. Our country's national products have been greatly affected by the invasion of foreign goods. The majority of the people are happy to use foreign goods and reject national products. The reason for this is not that our people lack patriotism, but that foreign goods are cheap and of good quality, which deeply meets the psychology of Chinese people, especially women. In other words, the credibility of our country's national products has been lost for a long time. In reality, they are not as good as foreign goods in many ways, and transportation and agricultural industries are also not advanced, so the result is always unable to resist the influx and sales of foreign goods. The representatives are all enthusiastic, patriotic, honest, and upright merchants. From now on, you should think from this perspective and pay more attention to try to reverse this decline. This is what our chamber hopes for, second. Shanghai is the best in our country's industrial and commercial achievements. In this situation of resisting goods, our Shanghai has a significant role. From now on, how should we strive to unite, have a long-term vision, hold a fearless spirit, and persevere to the end, without being a five-minute heat, and giving people cause for mockery? This is what our chamber hopes for, third. Our chamber's national products market has always aimed to promote national products and develop domestic and foreign trade, collecting excellent national products and selling them at reasonable prices, so people come to purchase them in an endless stream, and it can be called the hub of the national products industry. At this time of national crisis, we plan to adopt the opinions of the national products industry, expand publicity, and give the knowledge of national products to all the Shanghai and Chinese compatriots, so that everyone can agree that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's national products market is the only large market that promotes national products and sells them at reasonable prices, directly boosting the sales of national products and indirectly restraining the Japanese. The representatives are not lacking in capable people. I hope they will express their opinions as much as possible to serve as a guiding needle. This is what our chamber hopes for, fourth. Our chamber has convened this congress with these four points in mind, in order to plan with you all, hoping that we can proceed in unison, without slackening or neglecting. Our chamber would be fortunate, and China would be fortunate. Then, Mr. Zhang Zilian, representative of the Samsung Factory, Mr. Ji Jiannan, representative of the Sanyou Society, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, representative of the Kangyuan Factory, Mr. Zhou Hekang, representative of the Universal Factory, and others gave speeches, expressing extremely painful sentiments. The words were long but concise. It was decided on the spot to organize the Shanghai National Products Factories Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress, initiate the formation of volunteer armies to be the government's support, and ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify the trade associations to relay the matter to each manufacturer for responsible handling, and to submit a proposal requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to the five national products associations to seek opinions and unite into one large national products organization, so that they can concentrate their strength and unite. The meeting adjourned around 7 PM.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Increase in Police Rate Next Year</h3>
<p>Restoring the Old Rate of Sixteen Percent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that it plans to increase the police rate next year, restoring the old rate of sixteen percent. In recent years, the world economy has been depressed, and all regions have felt financial constraints. The Municipal Council could hardly avoid being affected. According to the report submitted by the Accounting Department to the Board of Directors, the Council's finances have been greatly affected by the continued shrinkage of exchange rates. Combined with other reasons, it is expected that by the end of this fiscal year, not only will the surplus of 300,000 taels originally listed in the budget be exhausted, but there will also be a large deficit. It is found that within the current year's operating budget, the surplus of 2,271,568 taels from last year was used to offset the deficit. Therefore, if the next year's budget cannot increase income, then even if expenditures are maintained at this year's level, there will still be a deficit of at least 2,900,000 taels. Therefore, the Accounting Department proposed that, on the one hand, the heads of each department should carefully study the department's expenditures and consult with the Accounting Department to find effective ways to reduce government spending. On the other hand, the taxpayers should be informed in advance of the necessity to restore the old police rate next year. In addition, it is also planned to re-evaluate land prices next year and levy taxes according to the evaluation in 1933. These proposals have now been approved by the Board of Directors. The Council has already rigorously implemented frugality in expenditures. Even if it makes every effort to reduce government spending next year, it will still not be enough to make up for the deficit. It will inevitably have to restore the sixteen percent rate. The Accounting Department had already anticipated this matter in March of this year at the Finance Committee and in April at the Western Taxpayers' Annual Budget Meeting. Therefore, it was said at the time that if the exchange rate could not greatly increase in the short term, it would be necessary to restore the donation rate before July 1930 in 1932. Now everyone knows that the silver price has fallen to a new low, and it has only rebounded in recent weeks. The Shanghai Municipal Council's donation</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>rate is also unnecessarily repeated. If it were not for the sale of the Electricity Department, it would probably have increased to 20 percent now, which would be difficult to control as it is now. As for the Electricity Department's sale price of 81 million taels, it will be paid off in five years. Of which 54 million taels will be used to redeem the Municipal Council's public bonds. The remaining 27 million taels was originally designated for capital expenditures. Only the interest payable by the Shanghai Electric Power Company on the unpaid sale price is allocated to the operating expenses. In the future, the Accounting Department also plans to change the original policy and store approximately 12 million taels of the estimated allocations for capital expenditures in the 1932 and 1933 sales for temporary emergency expenditures and to offset the deficit in operating expenses in the next few years. As for the original construction program, it will need to be slightly delayed, and the required funds are planned to be raised using the prevailing method of issuing bonds.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ships Transporting Japanese Rice</h3>
<p>Armed Protection During Loading</p>
<p>The Japanese military's occupation of our country's territory has aroused the common hatred of all our people. The business community's economic disengagement is proceeding particularly severely. The exchange of Japanese goods has been greatly reduced. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, a large batch of Japanese rice at the dock of the Osaka Company, a Japanese company in Yangshupu in this port, needed to be loaded for various ports such as Nanjing. A certain shipping company in Shanghai dispatched two of its ships to the dock for packaging, one ship for loading first, and the other for continued transport. With the prior consent of the Japanese company, Japanese people carrying handguns and weapons were stationed around the dock to guard the rice being loaded onto the ship. Small fireboats were also dispatched in the Huangpu River to provide armed protection. The first ship was fully loaded last night and is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>County Affiliates Busily Handling the Rush漕 [Grain Transport] and Accepting Bundling Businesses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County's bundling business system has been restored by the county bureau's clear order to facilitate the rush grain transport and collection. It is now known that the district chiefs are now gathering the township chiefs and bundling business representatives to discuss the turnover. All matters will be completed before the 15th of this month. This year's winter grain transport collection will be handled by the bundling businesses. All of this year's busy money and old debts will still be the responsibility of the township chiefs to collect and close the accounts.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order Reiterating the Prohibition of Rice Exports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, "It is found that rice and grain in Jiangsu Province have always been prohibited from being privately transported out of the province, and orders have been repeatedly issued to strictly prohibit this. This year, various counties have suffered from continuous rain, resulting in a poor autumn harvest. Regarding the private transport of rice and grain out of the province, the prohibition should be reiterated to maintain the people's food supply. It is hereby ordered that the county magistrate order a thorough investigation. If there are any cases of transporting rice out of the province or leaking to the sea, they should be investigated and dealt with. Rice should continue to circulate normally among the counties within this province, and prices should not be suppressed under any pretext. There should be no delays or violations." This order.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Pacific Institute</h3>
<p>Decision to be Made at the Meeting on the 12th</p>
<p>The Pacific International Institute had previously decided to hold a meeting in Hangzhou on the 21st of this month. However, recently, due to the issue of the Japanese representatives' attendance, changes have occurred. Therefore, the previously decided date of the 21st for the meeting may not be realized. However, according to Mr. Green, chairman of the administrative council of the institute, as told to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the meeting will likely be decided by the board of directors at the affairs meeting on the 12th or 13th. Here is a record of the conversation between Xu Xinliu and Chen Liting, our agents-general.</p>
<p>Xu-Chen Conversation: Each member country of the institute has a director or honorary agent-general. The agent-general of our country is Mr. Yu Rizhang. Mr. Yu has recently been ill and replaced by Mr. Xu Xinliu as agent. According to what he told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the previous report that the Japanese representatives would not attend the formal meeting, this is the opinion of some foreign representatives. However, this matter cannot be raised to Japan, not only by our representatives but also by other foreign representatives. It can only be said that the Japanese representatives themselves have expressed their intention not to attend. Therefore, whether this meeting will be held as scheduled will depend on the decision of the board of directors of each country at the meeting on the 12th. According to representative Chen Liting, the Japanese representatives believe that it is unsafe to hold the meeting in Hangzhou and do not intend to participate. However, they believe that a meeting without Japanese representatives would be illegal and request that the meeting be held in Shanghai. Since our side has already made considerable arrangements for the Hangzhou venue and Shanghai is a concession and does not have a suitable location, most representatives do not agree. Our side is currently discussing this matter, and after a decision is made, an affairs meeting will be convened. As for Mr. Green, the chairman of the institute, he said that three Japanese representatives plan to attend, referring to attending the affairs meeting.</p>

<h3>News from Mr. Cao Xiangzhi (Letter to the Central Military Academy)</h3>
<p>I have served in the education field in Nantong for several years and feel that the education authorities are discriminatory and self-serving. Ashamed to associate with them, I came to Shanghai simply dressed. With the national crisis at hand, public and private matters have angered me. Rather than endure death to seek life, I abandoned my pen to join the military. I am attaching a letter to the Central Military Academy. If you believe it will be beneficial to the people's hearts, please publish it. "Letter to the Central Military Academy" Respectfully, the enemy troops have invaded our borders and penetrated deep, and the extent is still unknown. Our country's standing army is only this number, and there are no reserves. The people have no training and it is even more difficult to mobilize them in a hurry. Although our compatriots have a sincere desire to serve the country, they certainly have no effect on repelling the enemy with righteous indignation. The other day, the newspaper reported on the plan for a special military training class at your academy. This is indeed one of the emergency measures. On the one hand, it is storing up talent for the country, and on the other hand, it is cherishing talent for the country ("Bloody men will not snipe at people or commit suicide, but will have a place to belong.") It can also revitalize the superficial and boastful national spirit and expand the spirit of strict discipline. Even if the situation stabilizes and there is no need for war, it is still an essential plan for governing the country to train the people militarily. This is what Xiangzhi bows his head nine times to ask for the early realization of. Moreover, history tells us that people like Wu Zixu and Yue Goujian must have something to rely on before they can achieve something. Otherwise, people like Wen Tianxiang, Lu Xiufu, and Shi Kefa can only sacrifice themselves for righteousness and leave only memorials for future generations to mourn. Furthermore, if a country is to stand, it must gather the elites of the whole country and accumulate strength to become strong before it can achieve anything. Recently, Feng Yong University is like an osprey that cries out once. However, how much can it fly with bows and arrows filling the market? The generals in the Northeast were also not weak, but the situation was such that they could not resist and could only endure humiliation and resentment. Now, the central government still has time to respond to emergencies, and Japan has not yet reached the strength to swallow an elephant. If Japan gains Manchuria and Mongolia and has another ten years, we will certainly be ghosts under their knives, and even if the great powers want to compete with dogs for food, there will be nothing we can do. This is what Xiangzhi has deeply considered repeatedly, and I am extremely willing to go to your academy to study and take the opportunity to serve the country. Xiangzhi is thirty-one years old and graduated from Great China University. I have also been engaged in education for four years. I deeply believe that the people's morals have declined and the national spirit is waning. Educators are greedy for quick success, eager for practical benefits, and promote favoritism, and there is no righteousness at all. Therefore, Xiangzhi is extremely willing to work hard to revitalize the outlook of a county or a village. At this time, only if everyone competes with all their strength, is firm and calm, and enables the whole country to transcend national hatred, can we save the fate of the country and plan the final miraculous feat with the determination to die. This is all. I express my urgent words, with ink and tears together, and cannot fully express what I want to say.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your letter is extremely pertinent and extremely painful. We will publish it immediately.</p>
<h3>News from Mr. Gu Zhishan (Please Transfer the Lantern Fee to Relieve the Flood Disaster)</h3>
<p>October 10th is the date for the National Day celebration. Now, the land is full of wailing, waiting for relief. If the lantern fee is transferred to relief funds, gathering sand into a tower, the amount will be considerable. The contributor is already within the budget expenditure, which is easy to do, and the disaster area will receive more assistance, which is not a shallow benefit. A sincere and great good deed to commemorate the disaster victims. As far as my humble opinion goes, I contribute to the newspaper and wish the people of the whole country, all organizations, all groups, and all schools to rise up and do it.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing to inform you that the section "Wan Zhenbao Withdraws Lawsuit" in the local news column of your newspaper on the 7th of this month, which stated that Wan Zhenbao had improper behavior, is completely untrue and is obviously a rumor fabricated by a villain. As for the settlement, Zhao Zhuochen repeatedly asked many people to intercede after being sued. Finally, lawyer Luo Jiaheng sent a letter to our lawyer, and Zhao Zhuochen's younger brother, Zhao Fuchen, discussed the settlement terms at the Dengtuomo Hotel. Zhao Zhuochen returned all losses and expenses to Wan Zhenbao, totaling 5,500 yuan. Wan Zhenbao withdrew the lawsuit and published a statement severing the relationship. The news published in your newspaper has harmed the reputation of women. We hereby request that you correct it immediately and publish this letter as it is. Sincerely, Attorney Xu Bingcheng, October 7th.</p>

<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots. Since the tyrannical sun suddenly occupied the Northeast, launching an undeclared war, our country has retreated without resistance, without fighting back. Counting on our fingers, it has been twenty days already. Although the League of Nations has sent a note to the tyrannical sun asking them to withdraw their troops, their troops have not withdrawn and have instead occupied Yingkou and Niuzhuang, and are further demonstrating their power on the sea with warships. Step by step, they are pressing closer. On our country's side, apart from the enthusiastic patriotic students and merchants who are running around calling for national salvation, we are still at a loss. We, the masses who have no axes to grind, can only face this difficult and arduous situation with a calm and resolute attitude. We unanimously request the authorities to abolish the policy of non-resistance and to develop a spirit of fearlessness.</p>
<p>Removing Garden Grass, Zhaifu Talking About the Essence</p>
<h3>Military Advisors of New and Old China</h3>
<p>Since China is a democratic country, the common people are simply being impolite in acting as Liu Shan. However, if Liu Shan does not have Zhuge Liang, the country will be destroyed. Who is our Zhuge Liang? Where is he? If I announce his name, everyone will surely laugh until their stomachs hurt. Who do you say is the military advisor who holds the highest authority in China today? The spirit mediums, fortune tellers, physiognomists, diviners, and character analysts, and the divination tubes in front of the wooden Bodhisattva. The great men and gentlemen determine their careers based on their birthdates. Those in power use people based on their physiognomy. A criminal court prosecutor said to me: "His fierce appearance will kill people." One day, I passed by a character analysis stall and saw a female student divining there. I thought to myself: "Do female students also believe in divination?" Curiosity made me stop. The female student said: "A friend of mine hasn't written for several days. I want to ask what day I will receive a letter." The character analyst said: "Boyfriend or girlfriend?" The female student was embarrassed (I resented myself for being a thorn in her side) and only said: "Anyone will do, as long as it's a friend." When the March 18th Massacre occurred, several officials of the Provisional Government had to perform divination first before daring to attend the State Council meeting. Needless to say for the old women, whether it's marriage, travel, or illness, they all have to consult a fortune teller or a clay or wooden Bodhisattva. You always think that robbers and bandits are fearless of heaven and earth, but little do you know that they can't do without the Bodhisattva. Before the Taibao Ashu case, they had to burn incense and seek divination. If it was auspicious, they would proceed; if it was not auspicious, they would stop. This matter reminded me of Li Chuang. After Li Chuang escaped from Zhang Xianzhong, he was defeated by He Renlong. One of his subordinates, Liu Zongmin, who had previously been a blacksmith, wanted to surrender. Li Chuang found out and sat with Zongmin in a temple to sigh. He said, "People say I have the fortune to be an emperor. Why don't we ask the Bodhisattva? If it's auspicious, follow me; if it's inauspicious, take my head and surrender." Zongmin agreed and put the knife in his waist to watch. All three times were auspicious. Zongmin then killed two wives and continued to follow Li Chuang. Li Chuang then fought all the way to Beijing. There are still many Li Chuangs in China today, and Liu Zongmins are not few either. In short, in one sentence, the military advisor of old China is the god of superstition! In the scientific world of the twentieth century, a nation that worships the god of superstition as its military advisor will inevitably be eliminated by nature. Liu Shan, Liu Shan, four hundred million Liu Shans! You must quickly invite Zhuge Liang out. Who is Zhuge Liang? Three cobblers are worth one Zhuge Liang. Our three cobblers are: (1) civil officials who are not greedy for money; (2) military officers who are not afraid of death; (3) scholars who use both their hands and brains (Science, that is, science scholars.)</p>
<h3>World Small Notes</h3>
<p>Gandhi Salt Bottles Popular in France Gandhi, the leader of the Indian people's movement, used non-violent resistance against England to strive for the lifting of the salt ban and allow the Indian people to freely make salt on the seashore. His name shook the world. A certain porcelain factory in Paris, the capital of France, specially manufactured a kind of Gandhi salt bottle to worship the hero and provide seasoning during meals. The entire salt bottle is a small statue of Gandhi, imitating his usual squatting posture. Many small holes are opened in the head to allow salt to be sprinkled out. The gentlemen and ladies of Paris like to use this small salt bottle, which is fresh in design and exquisitely crafted. Therefore, the sales are extremely good. Some people may misunderstand and think that Gandhi's image was made into a salt bottle because he strived to lift the salt ban, which seems to contain a joking meaning. In fact, there is no such intention. Westerners worship heroes and often express it in these small things. In recent years, both England and France have indeed popularized this kind of five-flavor bottle decorated with political figures. For example, the great British politician Baldwin has also had his image made into a small wine jug by porcelain merchants in his own country.</p>
<h3>A Talk About the Past and Present of Foreign Attitudes</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>The East Province has been occupied by the Japanese army for twenty days. There has been no progress in negotiations. If this continues, the country will no longer be a country. Our central government, regarding this serious problem, does not know how it will be properly resolved. People today often say that the foreign policy of the Qing Dynasty was weak and made concessions at every turn.</p>
<p>However, I accidentally found a passage about foreign policy in an old book about the Gengzi Rebellion during the late Qing Dynasty. Although they also knew that it was difficult to put into practice at the time, they still felt more excited than the current attitude towards foreign countries. I extracted the original text as follows:</p>
<p>"Edict issued on the nineteenth day of the tenth month of the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu. The current situation is difficult, and the countries are watching with covetous eyes, competing to enter my house and chambers. In terms of China's current financial and military strength, there is absolutely no reason to start a dispute. However, the arrival of the incident is really forcing us to be here. In the event that a strong enemy bullies us, threatening us with something that cannot be agreed to, we can only be justified and righteous, and fight the enemy with the same hatred. The outcome of the victory or defeat is unpredictable. The governors and governors of the provinces often have a word 'peace' in their hearts when dealing with foreign affairs, which leads to no preparation at all in temporary times. Such stubborn habits are the worst of ingratitude and betrayal of the country. This is especially strict rebuke. In the future, if there is a matter that cannot be resolved without war, if war has already been declared, there is absolutely no reason to negotiate peace immediately. The governors and governors of the provinces must work together with one heart and one mind, regardless of barriers, to supervise the generals and soldiers to kill the enemy and achieve results. The word 'peace' must not only not be spoken, but also not be kept in the heart. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, with hundreds of thousands of miles and hundreds of millions of people. If we can all be loyal to the emperor and love the country, then what strong enemy is to be feared? It is not necessary to turn swords into plowshares and rely solely on diplomatic negotiations. This is to inform you of this notice. Respect this."</p>
<h3>Records of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting Aid Society</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Shanghai Raising Various Provincial Flood Disaster Relief Women's Group, Ms. Yu Danhan and Ms. Tang Guanyu, initiated the solicitation of ancient and modern celebrity calligraphy and painting exhibitions to aid relief. After more than a month of preparation, it has recently been completed. It has been decided to open from the 9th to the 11th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fourth floor of Tibet Road. It is said that the association issued 200 calligraphy and painting aid relief coupons in advance, with a selling price of 50 yuan each. Famous collectors, connoisseurs, and famous calligraphers and painters were invited to donate fine works, and Ms. Yu and Ms. Tang funded the exquisite mounting. Each coupon is a piece of art. At 3:00 PM on the 11th, the pieces will be drawn publicly at the meeting place. As the news spread, the coupons were sold out. Yesterday, I accidentally saw the modern pieces mounted by the association. They were all exquisite and peerless, such as Zhang Shanzi's tiger, Daqian's Dragon Boat Festival scene, Xiao Zhequan's landscape orchid stone, Wang Shizi's sleeping lotus fish and birds, Huang Binhong's landscape, Wang Yingbin's chrysanthemum stone, Xie Gongzhan's willow lotus pine chrysanthemum, Li Zuhan and Qiujun's siblings' landscape, Wang Ge's daffodil banana chrysanthemum, Tu Ge and Tu Shi's sisters' landscape, Zhang Shimin's plum sparrow, Feng Chaoran's imitation Dong landscape, Xie Yucen's seal script, Ma Wanli's regular script pipa grapes, Lou Xinhu, Wang Shengyuan, Xiao Yousheng, Wang Ziyuan's landscape, Wu Dongmai and Ma Gongyu's calligraphy, Zheng Manqing, Ma Mengrong, Zhang Hongwei, Xu Shoumei's flowers, all have unique features. Zheng Wuchang's ink four-foot vertical axis, drawing a vegetable and a dead tree, with the inscription brush like a forest. Wuchang self-titled Cloud. The frost is green and the dew is white, which doubles the spirit. The ink is dripping and the writing is true. One paper wants people to lose ten stones. I don’t know who is willing to sympathize with the sinking. Remembering the pastoral in late autumn, I don’t write peony but write vegetable roots. Wealth is fleeting and people are easy to grow old. It is better to leave a good name to my children and grandchildren. Xie Gongzhan titled Cloud. Eat up the vegetable roots and eat the bark. The common people are thousands of miles away. Can buy ten stones of painting. Both Fu and Hui are not considered foolish. Zhang Shanzi titled Cloud. The dead wood does not become shade. When will the floating clouds be destroyed? Eating vegetables is like tasting gall. National shame can be snowed. Lu Danlin titled Cloud. All the trees are withered. The vegetable roots are cut off. The wailing is terrible. My heart is full of sorrow. Xie Yucen titled Cloud. The old tree has more life. Song Fei sent out the late fragrance. A full eye is in front of me. Can</p>
<h3>Records of Scenes in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Paper Hanger</p>
<p>The art of paper hanger in the northern capital surpasses the four realms and is almost on par with that of the carpenter. If the residence is newly settled and is disliked for its old and broken appearance, the paper hanger is called to paper it, and it will be fresh and eye-catching. The most magical of its arts is the wellhead, which is all delimited with colored paper, which is as if it were painted in color. Wu Zi Feng, there is no trace to be found. In recent years, the price of labor has gradually increased, and each room requires three or four yuan. However, in terms of stucco work, its price is much cheaper. It is said that the Qing court needed paper hangers, and Suzhou sent four people specially. As soon as they arrived, a small gourd was issued and they were ordered to paper it. One person meditated for a long time, and then removed the stems and placed them in a bowl to sharpen them. The three people shook each other, making them extremely smooth. Then, soak the white cotton paper in water overnight, mix it evenly, and pour it in. That is, pour it away. Wait for it to dry and then pour it. After doing this several times, advance to the emperor. Breaking it reveals that there is paper throughout, with no traces of patching. Perhaps this technique was transmitted from Wu to the Northern Capital. In the past generations, the capital cities were the gathering places for famous craftsmen, while their hometowns may have lost the tradition. The ceiling is the most difficult part of papering the house. On top of the house, sorghum is used as a frame. The reeds are tied upside down on the rafters, and paper is pasted under them, which is called a ceiling. Those who are not good at papering will often wrinkle. There is no such thing as a craftsman in the Northern Capital. Extravagant people arrange them in squares like caisson. Recently, there have been people who use palm curtains as ceilings, which are also quite elegant. However, the method of papering cannot last for long. Rats nest in it, and they will wear it out in a few months. It is also easy to get dirty when touched by hand, so it must be changed every one or two years. The art of architecture is advancing day by day, and this art will eventually be eliminated.</p>
<p>The windows in the north are tall and large. The lower layer is mostly embedded with glass, and the upper layer is pasted with Goryeo paper to prevent wind and sand. In summer, they are pasted with green cold cloth, and paper is used as a curtain, which is covered on it, and can be stretched and rolled at any time. The shape is elegant and clean, and the value is also cheap.</p>
<p>Ink is a Benevolent Drink. Wang Shizi titled Cloud. Floods raged in China. The people are in pain and leaving. How can vegetable roots be obtained? All the trees have no bark. The rest, such as the preparatory members of the association, Ms. Yu and Ms. Tang, also have several exquisite works of their own. It is said that no tickets will be used for the meeting. At that time, it can be imagined that the number of visitors will be like a tide. (Transfer remuneration to help relief)</p>
<h3>An Unprecedented New Record</h3>
<p>— Chang Tian</p>
<p>The world record for the 100-meter dash is, at best, just over nine seconds. Its slow progress is truly imaginable. However, looking back at the industries of Europe and the United States, managed with scientific methods, the speed of various manufactured products has greatly increased, almost everything exceeding its former rate by half. The inability of human power to compete with machines is further proven here.</p>
<p>Among the advancements in work speed, the two clothing-making competitions that caused a sensation in England are most noteworthy. The first was held in Leeds, specifically for Minister Shaw-Lefevre. From shearing wool off a sheep to the completion of a garment ready to wear, it only took three hours and twenty and a half minutes. However, the second time, at the Crolles company on Minories Street, they made a similar garment, breaking the record in one hour and ten minutes. The shearing of the sheep for that garment started at 10:25 a.m., and it was ready to be worn to a banquet before lunchtime.</p>
<p>It is also said that the pair of leather shoes worn by Minister Shaw-Lefevre were made in a similar rushed manner. From the removal of the animal hide to the completion of the shoes, it took thirty and a half minutes. However, the old American record was only twenty minutes. By comparison, it is quite inadequate.</p>
<p>Aside from industry, the rush system has recently been applied to agricultural products. It is remembered that in 1899, Mr. Blount of Birmingham, England, used fresh barley, reaped, threshed, ground, and made bread in eight hours. By 1906, after painstaking research, he had shortened the time to three and a half hours. However, in the summer of 1911, he redoubled his efforts to break his own record. He planted some wheat in a certain place, and on the afternoon of August 7th of that year, at 2:35 p.m., he began reaping. First, he threshed the wheat by hand, then ground it with a machine. After one hour and forty-two minutes, the flour was mixed with yeast and placed in the bread oven. The bread was baked in only two hours and twenty-one minutes. The record was broken once again.</p>
<p>It is also remembered that in 1878, a certain British engineer used the rush system to build a locomotive engine in twenty-five hours and thirty minutes. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company of the United States, upon hearing this news, was greatly surprised. They also wanted to compete with him in the same way. The result was reduced to seventeen hours. However, twenty years later, in 1899, the Great Eastern Railway Company of England, to save face for the British, used eighty-eight workers to prepare to build the same engine. Work began at 9:08 a.m. on December 10th of that year. In just nine hours and forty-seven minutes, the entire engine was completed. Wouldn't you call that amazing?</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Knocking Dreams (8)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Pei Shi's ideal was not wrong! In this century, the Englishman Stephenson had already invented the method of running trains on railroads. His thinking and Pei Shi's were the same, truly echoing the ancient saying, "Sages will emerge from the Northern and Southern Seas, with the same heart." However, Stephenson was born in England and invented mechanical work, enough for people to admire, imitate, improve, and publicize. Pei Shi was born in China and invented mechanical work, only earning himself nicknames like "fool," "idiot," and "old simpleton"!</p>
<p>"Pei Shi is dead! Pei Shi hanged himself!" Initially, there were voices of astonishment and lamentation in society.</p>
<p>"Pei Shi's death is pitiful but not regrettable!" Gradually, society's opinion changed.</p>
<p>"Old Man Pei was not wrong, the mistake was with Pei Chi; if he didn't die, who would?" Society's final opinion was to unanimously condemn the already deceased Pei Shi.</p>
<p>Why did Pei Shi die? He died under the examination system! He also died under the censorship of public opinion! He also died under the tyranny of his family! He also died under the poisonous hands of those who opposed scientific thought! The Stephenson of the East, vanished like a fleeting flower! Alas!</p>
<p>The cause of death:! Tao Chi and Pei Shi went to take the exam together. Tao Chi passed and became a Xiucai (a successful candidate in the imperial examination), but Pei Shi was nowhere on the list. Although Xiucai was a small title, in the 18th century, because of the saying "A Xiucai is the root of a prime minister," it gained extraordinary importance in society. Once the results were announced, the gains and losses were clear, and laughter and tears naturally arose together. Upon seeing his name not on the list, Pei Shi did not feel any particular gain or loss. Not passing the Xiucai exam could save him all the future trouble of the annual and provincial exams. He ran home in one breath, not busy with anything else, but busy completing his work on a small car that could freely travel on two wires because this work was about to be finished! Who knew that this would anger Old Man Pei, anger the Old Man Pei who only knew how to tumble through the list of examination successes. He saw that his son had not passed the Xiucai exam and was already frustrated to death. Not passing the Xiucai exam and still playing with these ingenious and useless toys, violating his subjective belief of "not doing what is useless and harms what is useful," this blaze of anger began to burn vigorously! He beat his son – smashing the door latch as an instrument of corporal punishment – and burned all the works influenced by these ingenious and useless crafts! He broke, destroyed, and eliminated the car that was about to be completed and travel freely on the wires! He ordered Pei Shi to only read classical texts from now on, and only write eight-legged essays! … Poor Pei Shi! He endured silently and hanged himself!</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>News of Japan Possibly Abandoning Gold Standard</p>
<p>Drop Exceeds Twenty-Six Taels. Yesterday, the 7th, the price of gold plummeted. A violent tide and alarming waves of rises and falls led to great confusion. One moment the price was two or three taels down, the next, seven or eight taels. Throughout the day, the fluctuations totaled twenty-five or twenty-six taels, which was considered enormous. The psychology of those in the trade was especially perplexed. The imbalance between supply and demand was probably due to a slight drop in overseas silver prices, and also because of renewed proposals in the United States to rescue the silver market. Confidence waned, but speculators remained brave. The market opened low, already breaking 710 taels. The exchange rate was complex, with British gold soft and American gold hard. Many in the trade were selling. Later, when banks did not follow suit to buy, the market seemed to ease. Furthermore, front-line operators were actively hedging, causing the price to rise again. Suddenly, news spread that Japan was considering abandoning the gold standard, banning the export of cash gold, and that there were significant disputes within the cabinet. This deteriorated the market atmosphere, causing a major panic. Sellers became bold, suddenly breaking the 700-tael mark. It was Wednesday, and there was no foreign exchange market, but this dramatic change was unexpected.</p>
<p>Early Market Shakes and Fails. The market opened in the morning already down four taels at 720 taels. The broad silver bar fell three-eighths, the forward rate seven-sixteenths, and the silver price fell only one-eighth. Another tael was lost, but some buyers appeared, pushing the price up to 21 taels. Then, due to British gold loosening, banks were mutually trading this month at 1.7375, then 4.375. Also, American gold was at 31.75 yuan, then 31.9375 yuan. Source, Mao Shun, Mao Shun Li, Tong Tai Chang, Qian Chang Xiang, and others were all selling, and the price fell six taels, to 15 taels and one mace around 9:30 a.m. A tael was added. The exchange rate was not yet announced, but the American gold rate was high at 75, so the exchange rate was squeezed. Then it fell slightly to 12 and a half taels. Xie Xing Yong and others sold. Soon, banks were mutually trading American gold for December at 31.75 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong and others were buying. As it approached 10 o'clock, it was 16 taels. It was heard that there were signs of fatigue. Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu, Cui Chang Yong, Yu Da, and others were dumping. The British gold rate was announced, and banks were buying at 1.75625. They were also buying American gold at 32.125. Therefore, the gold price plummeted eight or nine taels. At 10:15, it was 707 taels. Afterwards, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Heng, Shun Mao, and hedgers took advantage of the drop to buy. Also, MacKay and Citibank were absorbing American gold from 32 yuan to 31.9375 yuan. Then banks were trading British gold at 1.74375. From around 10:30 to 11:15, the price rebounded eight taels, totaling 15 taels and five mace. Later, retail traders were selling, and it retreated four taels. After 11:30, it was 11 taels and two qian. Suddenly, news came that the Indian exchange rate had fallen sharply by one rupee, adding up to 15 taels. However, there were still many sellers, so the noon close was 12 taels and two qian. It was heavily suppressed again to 10 taels. The announced price, with American gold at a high 75, was changed to around 770 taels, a squeeze of about 60 taels.</p>
<p>Evening Closing Breaks 700-Tael Mark. The afternoon market opened at 709 and a half taels. Suddenly, news came that Japan was banning the export of gold, and the selling momentum surged. Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Shun Li, Da Xing Yong, and foreign merchant Joe S. Dave sold, plunging the price by more than ten taels, to just 699 taels. Cui Chang Yong, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Zhi Feng Yong bought again, and the price immediately rose by three taels. At 3:20, it was 702 taels, but the selling wind did not stop. In an instant, the price dropped by more than six taels. At 2:30, it was 695 taels and five mace, with the momentum of an earthquake.

The long-term bars shrunk by four-thirty-seven-five, to seventeen pence. Most of the decline in foot silver was due to a lack of supply.</p>

The interest rate is still under consideration, as the current silver interbank loan rates are fluctuating, so the interest rate for these fixed-term funds needs to be considered.</p>
<h3>Security Cuts, Closing Nineteen Fell to Limit, Stopped Bidding</h3>
<p>The rest also fell sharply, with extremely quiet buying momentum.</p>
<p>The November period has not yet opened, and the market continues to be quiet.</p>
<p>Yesterday's security exchange's bond market situation: there were no spot market transactions all day, and the futures market remained quiet. The November futures have not yet opened. The Japanese are carrying out violent oppression, and large warships are successively encroaching on our country's central region. The diplomatic situation is becoming more serious. Therefore, the mood in the market is even weaker than before. The quietness of the buying interest has not been seen for a long time. The disparity between supply and demand is huge. The bond prices initially opened sharply lower. Although the financial sector slightly bought, the prices remained weak. By the time the morning market closed, most of the bonds had fallen by about two or three yuan. In the afternoon, the consolidated tax and salt tax were stable after falling heavily in the morning, but the others continued to fall. The military reduction bond for closing 19 yuan fell to the limit and bidding was stopped. The others, such as the consolidated tax and salt tax of the 20s, and the closing 19 benevolence bonds, all fell by nearly four yuan. The rehabilitation bond fell by a little over three yuan, and the whole customs tax also fell by one yuan and fifty-six cents, all of which were very large declines. From the close of the market, it seemed to stabilize slightly. The total futures trading volume for the day was 1.188 million yuan.</p>
<p>Bond type, spot futures, previous opening, later closing, change from previous day, transaction volume:</p>
<p>Whole Six, 10, 44.00, 42.90, down 1.80, 255,000</p>
<p>Customs Duty, 10, 40.00, 39.60, down 1.40, 7,000</p>

<p>Roll 20, 10, 44.00, 41.70, down 3.90, 1,250,000</p>
<p>Closing 20, 10, 48.50, 46.10, down 4.00, 1,500,000</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax, 10, 48.20, 46.10, down 3.80, 3,080,000</p>
<p>Salt Tax, 10, 47.50, 46.60, down 3.90, 2,555,000</p>
<p>96, 10, 11.10, 10.70, down 0.60, 155,000</p>
<p>In the above table, the two types of military reduction bonds for closing 19 yuan both fell to the point where bidding was stopped in the afternoon. However, the prices varied, as the price at which bidding was stopped was calculated by deducting four yuan from the previous day's accounting price.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Buying Sentiment Stronger</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned firm, and the trend is rising again. As foreign cotton has rebounded, and rumors have calmed down, the market is more stable. Buying sentiment in the market is stronger, but actual yarn business is still flat. However, there are rumors that Japanese factories may be stopping production, so there are quite a few speculators buying in, and the market is rising.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Has a Violent Reaction</h3>
<p>The cotton market has a sharp rise. Because American cotton has risen, the market is tight again. Bulls are buying in and adding positions. Most people expect American cotton to have an active rise. Buyers are even more active. However, American cotton production has increased more, and sales are not booming. Therefore, large speculators are still short selling when prices rise. Furthermore, the difference in foreign cotton prices is still low by 8 to 9 taels.</p>

<h3>Grain Market at Hexia Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, Chang, Xi, Su, and Tong sold over a dozen batches of early rice. Merchants in Hexia insisted on higher prices, refusing to sell unless prices increased. Furthermore, the prices in production areas like Beitan and Pingwang differed from Shanghai prices by as much as 30 cents. Given this situation and the unfavorable weather, although sales were not brisk, the market shape had become firm. Only three batches of Qingjiao new foreign Du Jian and new early rice were seen. While the outflow was weak, prices saw a slight softening.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's arrivals were not abundant, with a few batches of thick early rice arriving.

<p>Northern Merchants Continue to Handle Spot Goods</p>
<p>Inland Merchants Inquire About Futures</p>
<p>The foreign rice market had been declining due to continuous dumping by foreign firms, and sales had disappeared in various regions. The market seemed to be in a state of collapse.

However, yesterday, foreign firms stopped dumping, and none of them received telegrams to continue selling. Therefore, no new transactions were made for package deals.

There was no market for spot goods, and the future looked bleak.</p>
<p>Flour Turned from Rise to Fall: Yesterday, the flour market was affected by wheat, turning from a rise to a fall. When the market opened in the morning, prices for all months rose by several points to half a cent due to the outflow to Northern regions and short covering.
