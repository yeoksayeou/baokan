<p>關於目前水災之嚴重情形。記者已再四爲評。瀝陳慘狀。籲請國人全體動員。急起拯救矣。但吾人如天之福。得以安處天堂。對於被水區域人間地獄之慘况。旣未目擊。亦鮮耳聞。其悲慘嚴重至若何程度。容有未知。或且疑記者故作危辭。以聳聞聽。爰特搜羅散在各報所載事實。分被災省區爲長江流域。黃河流域。珠江流域三區。更進一步據實臚陳。以實吾言。至於各種數目字上之詳確統計。目前尙未能有。容當俟之緩日。茲請先言長江流域</p>
<p>長江流域被災之省區·爲湖南·湖北·江西·安徽·江蘇·浙江等六省。湖南連年旱災匪刦民已孑遺僅存。而五月更復霪雨兼旬。山洪暴發。排山倒海。推沙轉石。一瀉數十百里。濱湖各縣。更水勢滔滔。槪成澤國。計被災者共有湘鄉·湘潭·衡山·衡陽·茶陵·會同·安仁·平江·瀘溪·黔陽·沅江·漢壽·湘陰·益陽·南縣·華容·安鄉·常德·岳陽·臨湘·澧縣·安化·慈利·津市·溆浦·等四十二縣。將熟稻麥。漫淹無遺。田廬冲毁。不可數計。人畜漂流。觸目皆是。損失在數十百萬元以上。湖北地濱江漢。夙稱澤國。此次水災。武漢三市。全部浸水。平漢路軌。亦多冲壞。損失百萬。至於堤防潰决。被災區域。如巴東·祐歸·興山·長陽·宜昌·宜都當陽·枝江·松滋·江陵監利·石首·沔陽·嘉魚·漢陽·武昌·黃崗·圻水·圻春·大冶·陽新·廣利·黃梅·宜城·鍾祥·潛江·漢川·應山·安陸·雲夢·孝感·等五十餘縣。没禾漂麥。蕩析離居。即武昌一市。死人已達數百。災民約在百萬以上。江西匪災未弭。累年浩刦。茲復巨浸滔天。颶風乘之。崩堤拔圩。田廬漂没。家室流離。南潯路鐵軌冲没。不能行車。而被災區域。如南昌·新建·九江·彭澤·湖口·都昌·星子·德安瑞昌·鄱陽·以及濱湖各縣。都一片汪洋。死者浮沉水面。生者逃死山巓。哀聲動地。慘不忍聽。刦餘災黎。復浸洪流。人寰慘事。寗復再過。安徽淮泗北貫。長江横流。巢湖居中。地勢極低。此次山洪暴發。江流高漲。淮泗冲激。沙河潰决。巢湖横溢。洪波所及。受災最慘。全省如安慶·蕪湖·蚌埠·霍邱·鳳台·壽縣·懐遠·盱眙·宿縣·明光·當塗　·南陵·鳳陽·五河·蒙城·潁上·阜陽·天長·合肥·無爲·廬州·泗縣·渦陽·太和·毫縣·靈壁·六安等數十縣。槪淪澤國。田廬洗盡。損失難以數計。而洪水所至。壯者棲止樹頂山阜。老弱則隨流浮沉。甚至全家老幼。因逃死無所。以繩索繫成一串。坐以待斃者。尤比比皆。是此種景象。眞令人聞者心酸。聽者淚落。現該省各縣已發生搶米風潮。荒象旣成。危機四伏。哀此孑遺。正未知如何度此浩刦。</p>
<p>即此四省慘狀。已足令人觸目驚心。至於江蘇浙江及黃河流域珠江流域災况。容當續陳。</p>

<p>本年全國運動會因鑒下屆遠東田徑項目之推鉛球一項、將改用十六磅者、故亦决定遵照遠東規則、廢棄十二磅鉛球、恢復中國舊有之推十六磅鉛球一項、近來各報多謂十六磅鉛球係新設、中國並無舊紀錄可以參考、其實此事不確、按中國於清季末葉有用徑運動之初、即依世界規章、採用十六磅鉛球、民國八年、始改用十二磅者、距今十二年乃得恢復我國之古有項目、第一屆遠東、亦係用十六磅、自第五屆起、因中日菲三國之體力感有不足、故乃改用十二磅者、下屆再採用十六磅、亦係恢復原狀、决非新添項目、茲將遠東兩項鉛球之最高紀錄列下、十六磅鉛球、阿拉瓦里斯（菲）十一米三四、四屆十二磅鉛球、高田靜雄（日）十五米八○、九屆中國十六磅鉛球最高紀錄、民國二年時爲高思養所保持之十米九○、係在上海虹口公園造成、其後之全國紀錄、爲民國八年、孟繼懋之十一米　○、係於該年五月十二日、在菲都馬尼拉之遠東會中造成、孟曾參加三四兩屆大會均在鉛球競賽中入選由此可證十六磅鉛球在中國非係新添確爲舊有、本年之全運、亦應以孟君之紀錄、爲新舊紀錄之標準、</p>

<p>水脚價又乘機飛漲</p>
<p>本年春初、滬上中歐一路、曾發生航運界之激爭風潮、當時競跌水脚、濫放回扣、而日本船更從中搗亂、致歐洲線内釀成無規則的紊亂狀况、數月以來、各輪公司、咸受其累、今因釀生風潮之主要分子荷蘭輪公司、已感覺此舉之非計、乃停止激爭之進行、而仍願與各輪公司合作、歐洲航輪、乃復歸原狀、而出口水脚、則轉於此際宣告漲價、茲將調查所得、分記如後、此與國際貿易及我國對外出口營業、均頗有關係者也、</p>
<p>荷輪復入公會　本埠渣華公司經理之荷蘭東亞輪公司、係行駛上海往歐洲之英·法·比·德·及荷蘭一路者、共派有六七千噸輪船二十餘艘、往來華荷之間、每四週有一船到上海、歐洲線内各外輪組織一公會、對出口貨水脚之漲落、由會公訂、各宜遵守、荷輪亦爲公會會員、本年該公司以出口貨營業不佳、遂於春初宣告退出公會、意在不受束縛、可以自由跌價、藉謀多攬貨物、當時該公司退會後、即將運費大跌、公會中各輪公司以其搗亂營業、亦公議一致減價、决不令荷輪取巧、由是中歐線内之出口各貨、在此事發生以後、運費跌减有二分之一者、亦有十分之二者、數月以來、荷輪營業、因共同減費、絶未有絲毫起色、出口生意、反不如前、蓋跌價後收入更少、數月中損失不貲、至今咸覺前次主張之非、乃復由該公司向公會請求、仍復加入爲會員、表示合作、公會方面將此事提出討論、各輪公司、亦以陪同跌價、究屬非計、遂准其加入、仍爲會員、而一塲爭潮、至是始告解决、</p>

<p>— 楊冶白</p>
<p>剿赤軍興。江西大軍雲集。自蔣總司令親蒞贛垣督剿後。黨國要人。因公赴贛者更多。冠蓋往來。絡繹不絶。匪區民衆。避髜來省者尤衆。以此洪都新府。熱閙異常。爰將見聞所得。誌之以告。讀者。</p>
<p>屋荒　剿赤軍興。南昌機關林立。各軍雖出發前方。但辦事處及留守處等。大率皆在省垣。而一般工作人員之眷屬及暫時避禍寄居者更不可勝數。故公私房屋○皆有人滿之患。其情形與首都比較。恐尙有過之無不及。</p>
<p>檢查認眞　當局爲嚴防匪類混跡起見。對行旅檢查。異常認眞。車船碼頭。更特别注意。余此次隨國府委員兼總部軍醫監劉瑞恒氏赴贛。在南昌下車時。雖出劉之名片及通行證。猶復幾經交涉。始免檢查。其認眞可以槪見。</p>
<p>杞要憂天　赤匪盤踞之地。燒殺姦掠。暗無天日。唯省坦秩序尙極安謐。市民熙來攘往。行所無事。最近前方剿赤大獲勝利。人心益安。余友某君。月前應調來贛工作。臨行其夫人懾於共禍。遂返山東原籍。某君來贛後。見情形如此安靜。轉笑其夫人胆量太小。善作杞人之憂云。</p>
<p>商家幸運　剿赤期内。各方要人及次要人蒞贛者甚衆。杯酒聨歡。觥籌交錯。嘉賓樓普雲齋等處。座客常滿。各飲冰室亦利市什倍。又贛省特産瓷器夏布樟木箱。身臨其地者。莫不選購數事以作紀念。或分贈戚友。故一般瓷器店夏布店木器店等。生涯均頗不惡。唯一般娛樂塲如電影院戲園等。則因勦赤停止營業。是亦有幸有不幸也。</p>
<p>電燈瞎子電話聾子　南昌電燈　電話。辦理欠佳。電話甚難打通。電燈光極弱。有時須洋燭補助。故南昌有「電燈瞎子電話聾子」之諺。當此剿赤期内。各部工作均極緊張。獨電燈電話。故態依然。其保守精神。亦有足多者。</p>
<p>地圖暢銷　赤匪窮兇極惡。一般人皆望其早日消滅。當各軍協力圍剿之際。對前方軍事狀况。備極關心。莫不人手地圖一幅。俾明瞭進展情形。而一般初次來省者。因道路不熟。購南昌地圖者尤衆。余到南昌時。曾問書店多家。始購得江西分縣地圖一幅。而省垣地圖。則皆云早已售罄。一般人關懐時局之程度。蓋可於地圖之銷路卜之矣。</p>
<p>廬山受連帶影響　匡廬爲避暑勝地。每屆夏令。中外人士。登山逭暑者甚夥。今年因剿赤關係。各界人士。道出潯陽。輒抽暇登臨。牯嶺道上。倍形熱鬧。大好名山。頓增如許不速之各。殆亦受共禍之連帶影響也。</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>綁匪之盛行於滬上也。已有年矣。然近年以來。此種綁案。日見蔓延。即窮鄉僻壤。亦日有所聞。近如松靑交界處之泖河流域。綁匪亦日見猖獗。疊出綁案。茲將種種情形。誌之如下。</p>
<p>綁架情形　此次泖河附近。各地鄉村。所出綁案。情形大致相。同人數約七八人。或十餘人不等。在深夜或黄昏時節。駕一小舟而來。所携響器。僅長短槍三四枝耳。然鄉民無智。殊鮮抵抗之力。且鄰家雖有綁匪。亦閉門不問也。</p>
<p>定有眼線　綁匪之架人。必有當地之眼線爲虎作倀。引其入村。故綁匪入一村莊。道路熟悉。而對於一般農民。孰富孰貧。亦莫不洞悉。說者謂定有地理鬼嚮導云。</p>
<p>當夜贖票　據云此種綁匪。並無匪窟。架人之時。沿途擄得船隻。即可動手。綁得財神而後。在村外少候。着村中飭人前來接洽。所定條件。如雙方同意後。當夜即可贖票。</p>
<p>索價低廉　此輩綁匪。索價頗低。開價僅二三千元。而結果祗須五六百元。即可了事亦可謂大廉價矣。</p>
<p>付欵地點　綁匪所索贖價。雙方言定而後。鄉人或一時不能凑集鉅欵者。每於當晚先付若干餘欵約期再付。而所約交欵地點。據云大都在梵皇渡徐家匯兩車站附近荒塜亂墳之間。</p>
<p>十室九空　鄉人在此種情形之下　富有之家。早已十室九空。遷居城内。即有未遷者。入晚亦提心吊胆。睡於牛欄猪栅之中。以免匪徒注意。而孩童雖生僅數月。匪徒亦視爲至寳綁架而去。農人苦况。實不堪言喩焉。</p>
<h3 id="c192">談日本麻雀俱樂部 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 益三外史</p>
<p>近年來麻雀極受日本人的歡迎。其熱烈實在不亞於美利堅。日本當局恐怕造成人民賭博習慣。所以只許作爲一　種純粹的游戲。但是作賭者當然比不作賭者來得多。往往表面用籌碼作勝負。到了散局。總是金錢私相授受。</p>
<p>一般投機商人。就民衆心理的所好。都爭先恐後的創辦一種麻雀俱樂部。這種俱樂部規模大小不一。滿佈全國。招牌題名都很新奇。呌什麽「清一色」。「中發白」。「東風」。「九萬」之類。裏面裝飾都異常華麗。且有女子充當招待。在顧客人數不夠的時候。亦可凑數入局。但進去的人大半以靑年子弟居多。無非是醉翁之意不在酒。而且耗費不多。所以招座能力。頗爲雄厚。</p>

<p>離永嘉縣城二十里外。有地曰白嶼。瀕河有浮屠一。高可十級。其下亦甚傾圯。一望而知爲舊世紀之建築物。其可異者。則塔之全身。能自動向四面斜欹。而方向則每年不同。故鄉父老咸云塔所欹之方向。則彼方人民於本年内幸福有加。此種無稽之談。固不足論。然以一崔巍古塔。何以自能移動。是則不無可怪耳。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>印度之敎。修道者不掛寸絲。穿衣非丈夫也。上天下地。惟裸體者獨尊。赤條來去無牽掛。直至於今。恒河之側。聖者輩出。猶什百相望也。此中並不皆貧愚者。博士公子。王孫富翁。捨棄名位學術。乃至親愛。苦修勵行。來恒河側而仰天長嘯。以終其天年。暇則敎化羣生以道妙。蘇詩云。機鋒不可觸。千偈如翻水。執弟子禮而香花供養者。比比也。此古先哲人自度度世之一術。亞力山大王所以面折伏於尤儒者也。嗚呼。吾人止有作禮而退。又何敢非之哉。自吾觀之。兩足動物。殺也殺不了。救也救不活。是名社會。今能多殺人者。稱爲英雄。能棄世者。亦丈夫也。仙佛乎。豪傑乎。蓋世上同一怪物。而尙不能解决社會者也</p>
<p>恒河旁建築偉大。某所乃某王所造也。某富者捐充也。其室如櫛。面對恒水。景緻絶佳。蓋幾千年聖者輩出。逈過於吾之鄒魯虚名。今使吾人游鄒魯、有幾聞人可遇者。而恒河聖者大法猶隆盛也。中甘地新佛。亦印度敎中一徒弟耳。嗚呼。印度化如此。吾人亦安敢議之。西人近歸化印度敎者。亦漸不少。余等乃捨陸而上船。小艇可容十人。學生棹之。放乎中流。見有紅布包一物。置河邊。旁有灰。學生曰。此包者死人之屍。將燒化而投於河中。以直升天堂也。夫印度敎之天堂在水中。而回敎主穆默氏云。天堂在母親之足下。蓋彼爲現世說法。與印度敎苦行而回敎順世行與。又水中浮一物。學者曰。此死屍也。余驚問之。曰此一沙彌。死後人送其屍於河。亦升天之意。余乃欲大嘔。印人水葬之俗。即敬水而至如此也。</p>
<p>學生等問我中國婚禮。余曰。今頗自由矣。學生告我。印度之俗。娶妻可得錢。余問其故。曰人有女者。若十餘歲不嫁。則其親大困苦。若嫁。必須賠重産業·余奇之。問其故、曰女大不嫁。則必難守分。恐有意外之遇。則其親將受破門之罰。Aul-caste即被社會逐出其敎。女子有戀。即算辱及家門。故人皆與其家絶交。不能生活於社會。故急急謀早婚。或賠家産與壻乃可也。男子不早娶。尙不着急。故家養女者。甚爲恐慌矣。印度之俗。一生永遠不離婚。夫死寡婦常殉之。以爲常也。余奇印人理想。凡事皆造一定命制度。將活人皆釘一死法於制度上。而維持至今。此等制度最好藥方。以西方之自由結婚。與戀愛對治之。何其怪也。學生曰。今染西風。漸變化矣。</p>
<p>有一學生。一切神不信。余曰。試觀河邊神廟多倒矣。神乃不能自保其廟。須賴人來保神也。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>「那麽，你守着吧！大槪昨天來的陸先生今天還要來哩」！丁小姐輕輕地說。秋子也笑着答應。</p>
<p>不一會，陸先生果然到來，秋子站在大門口，遠過地就望見了，立刻先進去通報。當陸先生走進會客室的時候，丁小姐已經含笑地迎將出來了。</p>
<p>「來得太遲了！也許你不見怪吧」陸先生的柔和的語氣，温文的態度，很有力量地刺激着丁小姐的脆　弱的情感。</p>
<p>「等了好久的時候哩，我還以爲你也許有了旁的事情。」丁小姐說。</p>
<p>「隨便什麽事，在我的一切之中，會有比今天到這裏來的事更重大的麽？在我未來之前，我是如何地憂疑而且懦怯··我只想，也許我是終於要使你失望的：但是，現在我居然冒昧地來了，而且冒昧地帶了一件東西來了，你會得鄙夷我麽？還是，你會得憐憫我呢？」這一番話，陸先生的確是煞費苦心了，很宛轉的，很自然的，像一隻乞憐的小鳥之歌聲。</p>
<p>同時，他袋裏的一隻小鑽戒，就呈現在丁小姐的眼簾之中了。丁小姐除了微笑以外，没有旁的表示。伊說：「這是什麽意思呢？」</p>
<p>「這是我的貢獻，我希望它能夠換得世界上最珍貴的東西，那便是你的愛。」陸先生說話的時候，没有一個聲音不帶着波浪般的顫盪。</p>
<p>丁小姐不能不表示出羞怯了。但是在伊的無言的靜默之中，顯然地伊已經接受了陸先生的要求了。陸先生就輕輕地把伊的手拉了過來，輕輕地撫摩着，伊似乎要想避去，又似乎什麽都任憑着陸先生擺佈了。</p>
<p>在五分鐘後，丁小姐的左手的中指上，已經帶上了陸先生帶來的那隻鑽戒，伊們相互地注視着，眼睛裏好像流得出水，又好像發得出火。</p>
<p>秋子伺候在門外，伊分明知道在會客室中是很有着神秘的意味的，只是不敢胡亂闖進去，偷偷地在鑰匙孔裏窺探着：伊瞧見陸先生和伊家小姐並坐着，伊又瞧見陸先生先生隻戒指套上伊家小姐的手上去，伊又瞧見陸先生俯下頭去凑着伊家小姐的手接了一個吻，……伊的心不禁也强烈地跳盪起來。</p>
<p>最後，伊聽得室中在呼喚着伊了。伊走進去，還瞧見伊家小姐的臉上是滿籠着紅暈的羞態，雖然很矜持着，但總也掩飾不掉。</p>

<h3 id="c207">糧食河下米市跌勢又烈 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>南市　昨日各帮來源約抵二十餘號、内平湖及南港居多、浦存稍有、城鄉店銷呆滯、東新粳到頭見湧、人心平淡、進意减少、行胃亦因北市疲修、更覺懈淡、成交有限、售價祗得鬆落、厚稻薄粳行情削二三角不等、洋蘆尖貨則不多、走銷亦薄、但以洋米又增、市呈堅挺、陰化受通變提昂、鮮高去化不斷、市價挺秀、浦東新粳昨抵一百七八十石、至於店方銷路極淡、價格又跌半元、洋米實緣來貨久乏、棧存無幾、客帮辦動、頗覺不敷、市形復定、</p>
<p>新閘　米市來源三十餘號、市銷一蹶不振、新粳市形日鬆、普通貨短半元、情况仍須再跌、薄稻到旺銷呆、回落三四角、厚粳去化益稀、河存漸厚、買氣沉寂、蘆洋尖到源陸續　零拆稍有問津、産訉續告軟化、以上價悉跌一二角、市况極疲、埠尖價稍底廉、故店胃尙殷、情形微軟、客尖小去一尺、交易不多、惟來源似覺轉稀、白元貨缺形勢、日增二三尺、</p>

<p>昨日粉市呈初堅繼疲之態、以洋麥報價、回小一二角、且美麥存底甚豐、有傾銷之形勢、所以初開時、雖内地帮買氣甚盛、多數因水災關係、集中勢力、不過廠家有洋麥定成、逐步套出、故昂而復軟、結果八月份較前日好二厘半、九月份好七厘半、十月份至一月份好二厘半云、</p>
<h3 id="c209">麥市暫呈擯局 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價又回小一二角、内地帮雖因水勢不退、心思仍堅、惟空方有洋麥可定、足以交割現貨、雙方之擯局、均有力量、故成交轉寂、市少上落、結果祗十月份小二分、十一月份小一分、餘無上落、現麥因廠胃尙好、價趨平穏、開吳淞·雙鳳·太倉·直塘·黄渡·安亭·蓬萊·南京·鎭江·姜堰麥五千餘包、由福新·華豐辦去云、</p>

<p>共祇一百四十包…英法及綢帮銷路</p>
<p>本埠洋莊滬白廠經、美銷停滯已有數月、英法亦紙零星現貨交易、内地綢帮胃口尤小、七月份成交寥落、共祗現絲一百四十包、英法銷額占十之八、餘爲浙杭綢商購進云、</p>

<p>本廠布　邇來趨勢甚亂、華廠貨因受抵制日貨影響、大有直上靑雲之勢、尤以細布細斜更形居奇、較之抵制前須漲六七錢之譜、昨汽球細布售七兩九錢半、人鐘七兩八錢半、金城細斜八兩一錢半、蝶球七兩七錢半、且現貨異常缺乏、日廠貨自抵制前暢辦後、現貨亦異常缺乏、所以近日亦未下落、粗布自一度上漲後、漸趨平定、九磅五福爲五兩一錢半、十一磅人鐘五兩七錢、十三磅雙馬六兩六錢半、十六磅五鶴八兩二錢半云、</p>
<p>東西疋　東貨前數日雖在嚴厲抵制中、然走銷仍暢、長江流域比平日反形忙碌、良以滬上雖已實行檢查、漢口·沙市·長沙·重慶等埠仍在通行無阻、故寓滬莊客、紛紛托日商報關行裝運、所以貨價始終未跌、但至昨漢帮已來電止裝止辦蓋受水災影響四川長沙二帮、昨復有大批運去、雲南貴州等帮、邇來轉口貨亦有辦去、西貨相當之品、市上甚缺、故難期發展云、</p>

<p>泉州泡園、近日乏到、查號家存貨早經過焙、成本增高、茲以地頭存底已稀　而距出新期尙遠、故行方頗有進意、連日已有成交、上檔圓四百餘箱、價比前升二三兩不等、惟號存已屬寥寥、後市當有升無降云、</p>

<p>— 呆</p>
<p>現在意國各汽車廠的發展情形。大有一日千里之槪。而其中飛霞廠的進展。尤足令人驚異。我們如果回想到十年之前。那時飛霞廠並無盛名、而所産的汽車。成績也是平常的很。然而在最近的十年之中。竟有特殊的進展。歷年所産瓣車。竟無一而不受社會歡迎。銷數也一年廣大一年。到了現在。差不多没有一個城市的中間。没有飛霞汽車。總之。飛霞車在汽車市塲上。小轎車之中。委實可算獨一無二的車輛。而已有相當的地位了。自歐戰告終而後。飛霞就有五○一號新車的問世。因爲成績的優良。所以大受社會的歡迎。繼五○一而後。又有五○九號·五一四號·五二一號。歷年的新車。都有驚人的進步。所以銷路能這樣的昌旺。</p>
<p>以過去的飛霞車歷史而言。在各種新車之中。式樣的美觀、車室的寬大。大槪最是顯而易見。差不多没有一個人不知道的。内中就以五一四而言。車身的漂亮。竟得未曾有。軸基的長度。雖和九匹馬力的飛霞車無分軒輊。但車室的内部。地位放寬少少。雖有四人同坐其中。也覺得非常的舒適。絶無擠軋之苦。鋁屬所製的减熱器。形高而路狹。也足增進車輛的美徵。車身的構造。尤有出人意料者。便是四門轎車的上面。每邊裝有車燈三盞。兩門客車。有大窗兩扇。他如敞車及二人。坐轎車等。坐位都是非常舒適。而車身的外面。漆飾得又是非常文雅而美觀。總而言之。飛霞車外觀的漂亮。駕駛的舒適。實爲任何汽車所勿及的。</p>
<p>此外飛霞最近的新車。就在引擎　精美和電力的强大。是主要的優點。電氣系統。受發電機·蓄電池·以及線圈等統馭之下。佈電流。非常便利。而且發電力亦較爲强大。至於引擎構造。尤其是奇特。底盤接合的方法。主要的地方有四點。其中都有球形的橡皮。裝置其間。以作緩衝。分佈的方法。在齧合子附近者兩處。就是重要的接合處。其餘兩處。便在前部。而越過車架的。簡單的齧合子。裝以橢圓形小柄。動作的時候非常乾燥。不必加以注意齒輪盒用鉛屬製成。分四部加速。而且和齧合子接合之處。亦有螺釘接合。此外種種重要之處亦然。而滿佈網眼的小齒輪。尤足龠行車的時候、聲息全無種種優點。眞是不一而足。</p>
<p>繼五一四新車而後。不久飛霞又有六輪六缸公共汽車的問世。成績之優。得未曾有。曾一度陳歷於未蘭意大利分廠。公開展覽。如以意大利目前的交通事業而言。一如歐洲各國無異。熱閙的城市之中。都用公共汽車。來往行駛。以代電車。其中尤以意京羅馬爲甚。蓋目前羅馬城中。熱閙之處。除公共汽車而往。電車不准行駛。他如米蘭。法勞倫斯。納潑勒斯各地的中心區域。也採同樣的政策。不過没有羅馬的專制。可知公共汽車在意大利。銷路當然是不少了。新式飛霞大輪公共汽車。是六○四號。即在意大利製造。自飛霞有歷史以來娸　在意大利製造公共汽車。確爲首開紀錄。而且這種公共汽車。載重力强大得很。可容塔客八十二人。當然不可算少了。</p>
<h3 id="c238">轎式汽車之車廂裝飾談 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 玉相</p>
<p>現代生活之日趨於藝術化。已爲不可掩蓋之事實。凡百器物。俱貴裝飾漂亮。藉以動人。歐美人民。對於日常御用之汽車。亦每喜别出心裁。加以一番裝飾以自豪。而轎式汽車之車廂内。尤多新奇瑰麗之點綴。增益不少雅趣。茲特探錄一二。俾供海上駕車者之借鏡焉。</p>
<p>芬馨滿座　法國婦女生活之豪侈。久已流傳人口。若輩嗜用香水之風。尤極盛熾。非但玉體雪膚之上。終日香氣撲鼻。而若輩之衣裙及居處。亦每好遍洒香水。以誘惑異性。在不久之前。巴黎市上。每逢婦女開駛汽車過處。輒有濃烈之香水氣息。散佈於空氣中。令人心醉神蕩。蓋若輩於車廂内。亦大洒香水。是以芬馨滿座。春光外洩矣。至於英倫三島之婦女。則生性靜恬。愛好自然。雅不喜濃郁之香水。故每有於車廂内供養一二枝鮮花者。清芬徐來。幽雅欲絶。固另是一番風味。與巴黎之法國太太顯然異趣也。</p>
<p>照像琳瑯　照片畫像。在現代生活中。爲一種極有威權之裝飾品。汽車車廂内之懸掛照像。濫觴於美國。今則歐洲大陸上。亦屢見不鮮。此類照像。大都非常玲瓏精美。所佔車廂内之位置極小。而琳瑯滿目。十分可愛。照像中人。與車主之關係。槪屬十分親密。故不忍作片刻離也。美國靑年男女。尤多將愛人玉照。懸諸車内。以遣寂寞者。去年秋季。在芝加哥地方。不幸因此肇一巨禍。蓋一美國少女。名卡爾孫者。於駛車時。不時注視車中所懸伊笑容可掬之情人照片。一時粗忽。竟傷一行人。卒受徒刑數月。後始得自由云</p>
<p>錦繡幔墊　東方人之繡花緞片。精緻奇巧。夙為歐美人士所珍寶。邇來國内繡件之輸出海外。運銷歐美者。年有鉅額增加。據調查所得。知此項大宗繡件之承購者。美國最多。歐洲大陸諸國次之。其用於轎式汽車内作幔墊之用者。竟佔十分之六七。此風盛行一時。亦可以想見矣。</p>

<h3 id="c240">虎 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 雯卿</p>
<p>在赤道之下的國度裏、到處都是森林叢密、就是在村鎭或平原中、都是深綠的陰影緊緊的遮蔽著、若是爬上了大山小嶺、簡直不能見天日了、</p>
<p>蘇島的工鎭、是三面抱山、一面臨海、那山上的老虎和猿猴很多、若是天陰的時候、牠們在山中悲啼長嘯得非常凄切、但是在那些士人或華僑聽見了那種聲音、並不以爲然的、好像牧童見山羊喊呌聲的一樣、我初到那里的時候、聽見了那種聲音、便覺得十分的可怪可怕、我本來很愛在椰子樹旁去徘徊、也歡喜到紫藤花下去坐坐、、因此、我有些害怕出去了、</p>
<p>學校是靠在一個山腰間、周圍有幾百年的老樹環繞著、荷蘭政府新修築的環山馬路、不但是行人走車便利、並且還給老虎許多方便、每當夜深人靜時、牠們從山中跑到馬路上來散散步、看看兩旁懸著的電燈、聽聽士人的音樂、牠們不呌也不閙、好像是害怕驚醒了人們的清夢似的、有一天黃昏的時候、老虎和猿猴呌得特别的凄悲、我就問一個新交的朋友、</p>
<p>「蜜司張、今日老虎和猿猴呌得特别利害、這不知是什麽原因、」</p>
<p>「因爲牠們感覺到久居深山太寂寞了、想下來看看電燈、又没有錢的原故吧、」</p>
<p>「假昔我是影戲院的總經理、也許會要請牠們進戲院、」</p>
<p>「劉小姐眞的是慷慨、」</p>
<p>我問了她一句正經話、便引起她同我開了一次玩笑、確實、我有眞怕老虎、在前幾月、我在爪哇一個動物園裏、看見三隻小黃牛大小的老虎、被關在一個很大的鐵籠内、牠們見了游人、就惡恨恨的把自己的背彎得像騾駝、一根根的花毛、立在背上像小樹、牠們又張广血盆似的口、露出半尺長的銀牙、向著我們發出狂暴的喊聲、又把兩隻前爪高高地舉起搭在很粗的鐵欄上、同時把牠那大頭靠在鐵欄縫内、向著外面亂鑽、要是牠們能跑出來、恐怕每隻老虎吃十個人也不能飽吧、因爲那次老虎給我的印象很深刻、所以我特别害怕得最利害的、也就算是老虎了、</p>
<p>過了一些時候、我的朋友惠卿來了、我把山中多虎的消息告訴了她、她也不禁害怕起來、差不多連大門也不敢出了、我們的宿舍、是孤另另的、一間矮小的房子、深深地埋在椰子樹下、因爲天氣很熱、我每天晚上九點鐘才把窗戶和房門關上、惠卿因爲害怕老虎跑到房裏來尋食、所以每當夕陽落在火山背後、黑影逐走黄昏的時候、她就把窗戶與房門緊緊的關上了、</p>
<p>房子裏没有空氣流通、熱得要命、手上拿了一把扇子、什麽事情也做不成了、因此、心中感覺得很煩燥、我老實不客氣的說、</p>
<p>「你以前没有來的時候、我一個人住在這里、老虎偏偏没有把我吃掉、你要命做皇后嗎、」</p>
<p>「像你這樣的瘦骨頭、老虎虎還怕挺了他的牙齒哩、」</p>
<p>「你並不見得怎樣肥胖、你瞧瞧鏡子看、你就知道老虎一定愛吃你的肉嗎、除非是牠預先通知了你、像學校裏的女僕、有一百六十二磅的重量、她晚上還在馬路上跑去跑來、現在她還没有跑到老虎口裏去、」</p>
<p>「你不要同我亂說、我眞是煩極了、我本來决定經巴城回國的、就是你横一封信、直一封信催魂的、把我催到這老虎洞裏來、受盡了的驚駭、我要回去、我明天就要走、免得葬在老虎的腹中了、」</p>
<p>「好了、不要閙吧、閙得老虎聽見了、牠會要跑來找食物消夜哩、現在已有十一點鐘了、我們身體與精神似乎都感覺到很疲倦、明日七點鐘就要起來上課、我們睡覺吧、」</p>
<p>我說了幾句話、她也似乎很體貼我的疲勞、一聲也不響、沉沉默默的在房子裏鍍了幾了轉、就倒在床上睡覺了、</p>
<p>學校裏、每天整整的、有六點鐘的功課、從早上七點鐘開始、要接著上到下午一點才能完結、唯有星期六只有五點鐘、在最後的一小時、是學生自治會開演講比賽會、在平常我還可以修息一點鐘、可是在十二週的星期六、又輪到我評判了、當學生們演講完了、我也裝出一個老師的模樣、爬上講臺去、批評他們各人的語言、聲調、意思、態度、怎樣怎樣、全堂的生員、共有兩百多人、大家都聚精會神的坐在一個大禮堂裏、不料學校左邊的操塲上、不知是從那里走來一隻猛虎、牠夾著尾巴、坐在一珠大象樹下面、頭向著玻璃窗、好像是有人請牠來聽演說的一樣、這是一個男學生出去小便時看見的、當他亂跳亂呌地跑進來、會塲裏的空氣、差不多完全破壞了、等大家跑出去看時、那只老虎的身上、已經接受了一個荷蘭人的槍頭上三顆子彈、牠伸著四條腿、倒在樹下、在呼吸牠最後的一縷氣息、</p>
<p>這山中雖然多虎、但從來没有見過這奇怪的事情、這事發生之後、還引起全村鎭的人們議論紛紛、有的說是神虎、有的說是鬼虎、這些都是没有根據的論斷、有人說老虎害怕地震、因爲在一星期以前、曾地震過一次、所以老虎有些害怕、就跑到山下來逃命、不幸一逃就逃到荷蘭人的槍節上了、</p>
<p>那時惠卿越發害怕得利害了、不但是晚上要把房門緊緊地關着、就是在日裏也不敢出大門了、她見了那株象樹下的草坪上、老虎的創口中流出的一團鮮血、她不禁毛骨悚然、</p>
<p>在天氣煩熱的時候、非多吃冰水與水菓不行、我每次要下山去買水菓、她總是不許我去、有時我强免要下山時、她總是這樣的呢咒咀、</p>
<p>「你不埋在火山之下、就要葬在老虎口裏的、我不管、你去吧、」</p>
<p>「不會的、不要過於擔憂了、」</p>
<p>「這似乎和我没有我我的關係、不過、要是你暑假不和我一道回國、那末、我也應當寫一封信給你的母親、把你到這來患病的消息、和現在所處的環境、詳詳細細地告訴她知道、因爲我們出來的時候、你的母親把我當作你的大姐姐一樣、千託萬託、要我關顧你、因你的小孩子氣太重了、」</p>
<p>「請你不必使她知道這些、我暑假同你一道走就是、」</p>
<p>「那末、就很好、」</p>
<p>那時我答應同她一道回國、當時她就展開了眉頭、微笑掛在她的嘴唇上、以前要要我不生病要是我有川資的話、也許早已回國了、因爲那裏除老虎與火山兩層危險之外、還有許多無形中的壓迫、好像是怯弱的民族所應當受的壓迫、從那天起、我已十分的决定在兩個月之後、我再也不願意聽見深山中虎嘯猿啼悽切的聲調了、</p>

<p>Northern and Southern Route Armies Divide to Intercept</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Prepares to Visit Zhang in Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) To prevent the Shi faction from fleeing into Shandong Province, the Southern Route Army under Gu Zhutong is defending the first line, and the Northern Route Army under Wang Shuchang is defending the second line.

The Central Army units under Gu Zhutong and Chen Jicheng have arrived in Anxian, with the vanguard north of Shulu, and have surrounded the majority of Shi's rebels.

Their elite forces are almost entirely lost. However, the majority are still concentrated in the Wuji and Shenze area.

Currently, our Northern Route Army is joining forces with the Southern Route Army in Anguo, Raoyang, and Cangzhou to suppress them. The resolution is not far off. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Fan Pujiang Arrives in Jinan</p>
<p>Shao Lizi Returns to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shao Lizi returned to Nanjing today, and important figures all came to the station to see him off. Shao said that the Shi's troop problem was fortunate to have Chairman Han uphold justice and was resolved in the shortest time. The north turned from danger to safety, and he was very satisfied with this trip. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief also telegraphed him earnestly. After returning to Nanjing, he may go to Jiangxi to visit the Commander-in-Chief to report. Han said that the Central Government ordered him to be responsible for accepting Shi's troops, which he will comply with. If Shi himself comes to Shandong, the Commander-in-Chief will be generous and guarantee his safety. The Shandong-Henan area is being planned for the clearing of bandits. Suppressing bandits is very easy, but it depends on the quality of the bandit suppression troops. He has no other strengths, but he is confident that he can handle bandit suppression. Poor troops are the source of bandits. At the same time, Fan Pujiang, representative of Deputy Commander Zhang, arrived in Jinan from Beiping. According to him, he reported the course of the battle against Shi to Chairman Han on behalf of the Deputy Commander and also had a personal letter from the Deputy Commander to Han. The gist of the letter was that if Shi's remaining troops fled to Shandong, he hoped that Han would resolve it and prevent them from harassing the local area. There have been no battles on the front lines for the past two or three days. Shi's troops fled southeast from Shulu and the majority are crossing the Hutuo River. During this battle, the Northeast Army repeatedly yielded, and Shi tracked and forced them. The Deputy Commander had no choice but to clash with them. The resolution was quick, and the local area was not greatly disturbed. Shao Lizi asked Fan whether any of Shi's troops had fled to Shanxi. Fan said no. Most of Shi's artillery was lost. Wang Shuchang's troops have withdrawn to Machang, leaving cavalry to intercept on the front lines. Shi himself is missing, and so on. Shao's train then departed south, and Han and Fan and others went to the Provincial Government. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han said that if the core troops of Shi, such as Sun Guangqian and Zhu Wenwu, come, they will be accepted. However, the newly recruited troops, who have poor discipline, will be difficult to accept. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Provincial Government received a telegram from Cao Fulin in Dezhou today, reporting that a portion of Shi's troops, numbering ten thousand, had retreated to the area between Dezhou and Zaoqiang, and another portion, numbering about ten thousand, had retreated to the southwest of Dezhou to Wucheng, and sent a representative, Hu Shaowu, to Dezhou to negotiate. The reporter then visited Jiang Bocheng to inquire about the handling of these defeated troops. He replied that the Commander-in-Chief had long ordered Chairman Han that if the defeated troops of the 13th Route Army arrived in Shandong, Han was allowed to accept them, firstly because the officers and soldiers of that unit had been loyal to the Party and the country, and were coerced by Shi this time, which was irrelevant to the officers and soldiers, and secondly because after acceptance, they would not harass the local area. Now Han is completely following the Commander-in-Chief's orders. He was also asked whether the future food and expenses would be borne by the Central Government or the local government. He replied that they would naturally be issued by the Central Government. He has already telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief to ask for instructions. Asked what Zhang Deputy Commander-in-Chief's opinion was, he replied that it was completely consistent with the Commander-in-Chief's. Fan Pujiang came to Jinan today and has already talked about this. It is said that Zhang completely followed the Commander-in-Chief's opinion and asked Han to handle it. In short, the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief are completely magnanimous, believing that this rebellion of the 13th Route Army was only by Shi personally, and they have always had compassion for his subordinates. Shi himself is still missing. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fan Pujiang left for Jinan at 5:00 PM today on Zhang Xueliang's orders to visit Han Fuqu and will then proceed to Tai'an to meet with Ma Hongkui. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ministry of Foreign Affairs news: The Korean case will be brought up for negotiation after Ambassador Wang arrives in Nanjing to report.

On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Uemura, visited the relevant personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for some contact.

The water level in the city and suburbs increased by another seven or eight inches yesterday, and people felt even more uneasy. The Wuhan authorities are using all methods to prevent the disaster victims from dispersing and are striving to bring them together. However, the number of disaster victims is increasing day by day. The disaster victims previously taken in at the Xiechang Match Company in the Japanese Concession numbered only one hundred forty to fifty men, women, and children, but now they have increased to more than six hundred. Because the concession is safe, the disaster victims are flocking to it to seek refuge, but the concession authorities are on high alert, fearing that reactionary elements will be mixed in. Therefore, they only accept this number. The Chinese authorities, at this unusual moment, are taking the maintenance of public order as the top priority. Therefore, they are even more vigilant towards the citizens, especially the disaster victims. The Hankou Consular Corps, seeing the severity of the disaster, convened a meeting this afternoon to discuss countermeasures for the major flood disaster and measures to ensure the safety of the concession.

<p>A Certain Customs Officer Talks</p>
<h3 id="e8">This Year's Customs Revenue <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain British customs officer said that in principle, this year's customs revenue should increase to 400 million yuan. However, the reality is quite different. Last year's revenue was more than 130 million taels of Haikwan taels, equivalent to more than 260 million yuan, which was the situation before the new tax was implemented. In the first three months of this year, the global economic situation was not good, and the goods that should have been imported were all imported in advance last year before the tax increase, resulting in lower tax revenue than in the same month last year. However, the tax increased slightly in April, May, and June, but the number of goods was still less than in the same month last year. Originally, customs duties relied entirely on imported goods, but now there are floods in various places, the economy is depressed, and Japanese goods are being boycotted, so the number of goods imported by the originally planned merchants is also less than before. It is predicted that this year's tax revenue after the implementation of the new tariff may still be difficult to reach the revenue before last year's increase. In terms of customs duty principles, those who consider it very hopeless can only hope that the number of imported goods will increase in the winter months of this year, then there is still hope of exceeding the revenue of previous years. At that time, it will not be possible to make a judgment. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The authorities consulted with key figures in the salt merchant community regarding salt tax treasury bonds in advance, and the contractors used transportation tickets to borrow money to buy treasury bonds as much as possible. Before the treasury bonds are repaid, it is guaranteed that the new salt law will not be implemented. It is heard that after the principles of the new salt law were promulgated, the contractors pledged the transportation tickets to the bank, but the bank refused to accept them, and the banks that had already pledged them were urging them to redeem them urgently. Therefore, they hope that the government will give a written guarantee so that the issuance and mortgage of treasury bonds will put both the banks and the contractors at ease. It is heard that there will be a written method to strengthen the credit of treasury bonds. (4th Dispatch)</p>

The organizational charter of the collection bureau and the detailed rules for handling affairs will be announced and implemented after the draft is completed.

<h3 id="e16">(3) The Disaster Situation in the Yangtze River Basin <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the severity of the current flood disaster, the reporter has repeatedly commented, pouring out the tragic situation and appealing to the entire nation to mobilize immediately to rescue the victims. But if we are blessed by heaven to live safely in paradise, and have neither witnessed nor heard much about the tragic situation of hell on earth in the flooded areas, we may not know the extent of the tragedy. Or perhaps we suspect that the reporter is deliberately exaggerating to sensationalize. Therefore, we have specially collected facts scattered in various newspapers and divided the affected provinces into three regions: the Yangtze River Basin, the Yellow River Basin, and the Pearl River Basin. We will further present the facts to substantiate our words. As for the accurate statistics on various figures, we are currently unable to provide them. We will wait for a later date. Let us first talk about the Yangtze River Basin.</p>
<p>The provinces affected by the flood in the Yangtze River Basin are Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Hunan has suffered consecutive years of drought and banditry, and the people are already on the verge of extinction. In May, there were continuous heavy rains for several weeks, causing mountain floods. The floods swept down the mountains and overturned rocks, flowing for dozens or hundreds of miles. The lakeside counties were even more flooded, becoming a vast swamp. It is estimated that the affected areas include 42 counties such as Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Hengshan, Hengyang, Chaling, Huitong, Anren, Pingjiang, Luxi, Qianyang, Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Xiangyin, Yiyang, Nanxian, Huarong, Anxiang, Changde, Yueyang, Linxiang, Lixian, Anhua, Cili, Jinshi, and Xupu. The ripening rice and wheat were completely submerged, and countless houses were destroyed. People and livestock were swept away, and the scene was shocking. The losses are in the tens of millions of dollars or more. Hubei is located on the banks of the Yangtze and Han rivers and has always been known as a wetland. In this flood, the three cities of Wuhan were completely flooded, and many sections of the Ping-Han Railway were also washed away, causing millions of dollars in damage. As for the breach of dikes and the affected areas, such as Badong, Zigui, Xingshan, Changyang, Yichang, Yidu, Dangyang, Zhijiang, Songzi, Jiangling, Jianli, Shishou, Mianyang, Jiayu, Hanyang, Wuchang, Huanggang, Qishui, Qichun, Daye, Yangxin, Guangli, Huangmei, Yicheng, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Hanchuan, Yingshan, Anlu, Yunmeng, and Xiaogan, there were more than 50 counties where the crops were submerged and the people were displaced. In Wuchang alone, hundreds of people have died, and there are more than one million disaster victims. Jiangxi has not yet quelled the banditry, and has been ravaged for years. Now, there is a huge flood, and hurricanes have worsened the situation. Dikes collapsed and villages were destroyed, and houses were washed away, families were separated. The railway tracks of the Nanxun Railway were submerged, and traffic could not proceed. The affected areas, such as Nanchang, Xinjian, Jiujiang, Pengze, Hukou, Duchang, Xingzi, Dean, Ruichang, Poyang, and the lakeside counties, were all a vast expanse of water. The dead floated on the water, and the living fled to the mountains to escape death. The cries of sorrow shook the earth, and it was too tragic to bear. The remnants of the disaster were submerged by the floods again. Such a tragic scene in the world is unbearable. Anhui is crossed by the Huai and Si rivers in the north and the Yangtze River flows across it. Lake Chao is in the center, and the terrain is very low. In this mountain flood, the Yangtze River rose, the Huai and Si rivers were flooded, the Sha River breached, and Lake Chao overflowed. The flood caused the most severe damage. The entire province, including dozens of counties such as Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Huoqiu, Fengtai, Shouxian, Huaiyuan, Xuyi, Suxian, Mingguang, Dangtu, Nanling, Fengyang, Wuhe, Mengcheng, Yingshang, Fuyang, Tianchang, Hefei, Wuwei, Luzhou, Sixian, Guoyang, Taihe, Haoxian, Lingbi, and Luan, were all turned into swamps. Houses were washed away, and the losses were difficult to estimate. The strong took refuge on the tops of trees and mountains, while the old and weak floated with the current. There were even many cases where entire families, old and young, tied themselves together with ropes because they had nowhere to escape death, sitting and waiting to die. These scenes are truly heartbreaking to hear and bring tears to the eyes. Rice riots have now occurred in various counties in the province, and a famine has taken shape. The crisis is lurking everywhere. Alas, how these remnants of the disaster will survive this catastrophe is unknown.</p>
<p>The tragic situation in these four provinces alone is enough to be shocking. As for the disaster situation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the Yellow River and Pearl River basins, we will continue to report.</p>

<p>Zhengyangguan [Red] - [Association] Disaster Telegram - To the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper Office, The flood in Zhengyang this time was caused by the collapse of the Shaopi (the source of this water is Longxi Mountain) in the southeast and the flooding of the Pi River in the due south. Mountain water poured down from the southeast, and floods rose from the southwest. The Ying and Fei rivers were blocked in the lower reaches, and in addition, the Jiao River was especially turbulent and dangerous in the Sanhejian and Xidashan areas. Zhengyang is a low-lying area where many waters converge. The sources of water came continuously, and there was no way for them to dissipate, so the entire town became a swamp. Four-tenths of the city walls collapsed, and five-tenths of the houses were washed away. Merchants and residents closed their doors, and frogs were born in the hearths. Boats traveled in the streets and alleys, with water three feet deep. In addition, there was a shortage of firewood and rice, and it rained for a full ten days. The rich found it difficult to have three meals a day, and the poor died of starvation one after another. The sound of collapsing walls was endless, and the sounds of cries could be heard from time to time. An investigation revealed that the flood was more terrible than any in the past sixty years. At present, the flood has not stopped, and the continuous rain has not cleared. Alas for these disaster victims, there will be no survivors. In the future, the situation of the water will be unknown.

<h3 id="e61">To Discuss Defending Against Shi Yousan's Troops with Han Fuju <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Fan Pujiang Ordered to Visit Han Again</p>
<p>To Discuss Measures to Receive Shi's Troops</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Cao Fulin, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, came to Jinan from Yucheng on the 1st to report on defense matters to Han Fuju and request instructions on how to deal with Shi Yousan's troops retreating to Shandong. After discussions between Han, Jiang Bocheng, and Ma Hongkui, satisfactory preparations have been made. Cao immediately returned to Yucheng to oversee the defense this morning on the Taishan armored train and will inspect Sangyuan in Dezhou.</p>
<p>Ge Guangting, the Deputy Commander's representative stationed in Jinan, recently told people that the Deputy Commander will send Representative Fan Pujiang to Jinan again to discuss with Chairman Han the measures to receive Shi's troops. With Shi running out of options, coming to Shandong may be the only way to ensure his personal safety. Some people speculated that Shi would commit suicide. I believe that suicide is something that a man of spirit would do, and Shi is not the type to commit suicide. After Representative Fan arrives in Jinan, I will go to Beiping to report everything to the Deputy Commander. Ge also received a telegram from Qi Yiqiao, Chief of Staff of the Deputy Commander's headquarters, stating that the chairman, Jing Cen, your name is esteemed, the enemy has been defeated, more than 10,000 prisoners have been captured, and countless supplies have been abandoned. Our army is in pursuit. Our cavalry group is intercepting along the Hutuo River. Shi cannot cross and will be captured. The Deputy Commander is receiving guests and managing public affairs as usual and has specially sent Shao An (Fan Pujiang) to Shandong again. I hope you can come to Beiping for a chat when it is convenient. Qi Yiqiao East Kowtows (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Wan Case Begins Negotiations <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>First Contact in Changchun</p>
<p>The Two Sides' Views Are Far Apart</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence - Negotiations on the Wan case will be resolved locally. Our side is represented by Zhong Yu, negotiator for Jilin and Hebei, and the Japanese side is represented by Ishikawa, the Japanese Consul General in Jilin. Both Zhong and Ishikawa returned to Jilin from Liaoning and had a meeting on the 27th at the Changchun Foreign Affairs Office. (1) Our side firmly insisted that stopping construction, withdrawing troops, abolishing the weir, and rescinding the contract were prerequisites before discussing the issue of compensation for the losses of Korean farmers. (2) The Japanese side insisted that our side acknowledge the complete validity of the land rental contract for rice cultivation before discussing the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops and police. They did not comment on our side's demands to stop construction, abolish the weir, and rescind the contract, or on the issue of compensation for Korean farmers. Zhong argued that Ishikawa's insistence on his views was tantamount to going against the spirit of neighborly friendship and sincerely seeking truth and justice. Only when the views were closer could the negotiations be put on track; otherwise, there would be no hope of resolution. Ishikawa believed that what our side had proposed was unreasonable and not a prerequisite. It must be known that our territory had been invaded, and our farmland had been destroyed. The facts are all there, and the current situation can be investigated. No matter which country it is, it is afraid that it will be difficult to endure. Putting oneself in another's position, it is inevitable. Ishikawa had no words to respond to this. Zhong also said that if the Consul General takes the contract as a prerequisite before discussing the withdrawal of Japanese troops, it would be difficult to comply. Regardless of whether the land lease procedures are complete or not, the Changchun County Government only approved the review and verification, and there was no formal approval. During this review period, the lease was not submitted to the county for review. According to the regulations of Jilin regarding Korean people renting rice fields, 1. Only Korean people who have naturalized as Chinese and obtained a citizenship certificate, 2. Must first submit a request for registration, attach the lease, and then send personnel to verify and report, and after approval, issue a formal rice cultivation license to be valid. The Korean farmers did not complete these two procedures, and without waiting for the county government's approval, they forcibly occupied the people's farmland, started construction, built weirs, and dug trenches, which was a clear violation of the legitimate and inherent land rights of Chinese farmers. Moreover, Hao Yongde claimed that he rented the land for self-cultivation, hiring dozens of Korean farmers to guide the work, and did not state that he was subletting to Korean people for rice cultivation. It was purely a fraudulent means to seek the approval of our government. The conspiracy was exposed, and the right to land ownership was harmed. If this case were discovered within Japan, how could it be approved? As for saying that Korean farmers are poor and have a difficult life, giving them special consideration and allowing them to continue to cultivate rice is not only impossible to do because the land belongs to the people, but there is also no reason to allow them to forcibly occupy the land of the landowner. Although this consultation was not a formal negotiation, there were many arguments from both sides. As a result, Ishikawa agreed to telegraph the Japanese government for instructions on our demand to withdraw troops and stop construction and would schedule another consultation after receiving instructions. Zhong Yu will also telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Northeast Political and Military Council to report the situation of the consultation with Ishikawa and request instructions. Ishikawa telegraphed Tokyo for instructions on that day, and as of the 4th, there is still no reply, and the negotiations have been suspended in name only. (July 28th)</p>
<p>Andong Refugees</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Shelter is Closed Again <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Refugees Show No Intention of Returning to Korea</p>
<p>An-tung dispatch: The disaster-stricken compatriots who had fled from the Korean border to seek refuge here have been successively provided with funds and dispersed. On the 26th and 27th, suddenly 469 refugees arrived from Pyongyang and Wonsan. They were again taken into the First Shelter for accommodation. The head of the An-tung Public Security Bureau, Zhang Hanwei, considering the large number of refugees and the substantial daily expenses, instructed the refugees to decide where they wished to go and to depart as soon as possible, not to stay in An-tung for long. As a result, 145 refugees boarded the Jitong steamer for Tianjin on the 28th, 45 for Qingdao, and 5 for Dalian. Others sought employment in this port city or went to Heilongjiang Province, with many going to the Tonghua and Linjiang areas. In addition to providing train and ship tickets from the shelter, each person was given a small sum of one silver dollar for expenses. By 3 p.m. on the 29th, the dispersal was completed, and the shelter was closed again. It is said that the expenses within these three days amounted to more than 2,000 yuan. It has been found that most of the 400-plus refugees have gone to other ports to make a living, with none showing any desire to return to Korea. This is because they are mostly laborers, who had spent years building up their homes and possessions in Korea. This unfortunate catastrophe has caused them to lose everything, so they feel deeply saddened and unwilling to return to such a dangerous place. On the 29th, a little after 5 p.m., another 50 refugees arrived from Pyongyang. Twenty-five of them were taken in by relatives and friends, while the remaining 25, being poor and destitute, were sent by the Public Security Bureau to the Mao Xing Inn on Zhongfu Street for temporary lodging, and they will be provided with funds for dispersal within the next few days. At present, the large group of refugees have scattered, with only a dozen or so receiving treatment at the An-tung Shi Hospital due to severe injuries or other illnesses suffered in Korea. The medical expenses are paid entirely from donations, and after they recover, they will be provided with funds for dispersal. According to statistics, all the refugees who have come to An-tung have been received with donations from various sources, totaling over 18,000 yuan, of which approximately 14,000 yuan has been spent. There is currently a remaining donation of over 4,000 yuan. (July 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Unprecedented Flood in Hanshi <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>A Sudden Breach in the Upper Section of Shandongmen</p>
<p>Over Five Hundred People Swept Away</p>
<p>Water Depth in the City Exceeds Twenty Feet</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The Shandongmen railway gate, which protects Hanshi, collapsed at 7:50 a.m. on the 2nd due to the excessive water force. Following the breach of the Danshuichi embankment, the entire city was submerged by noon. The prosperous marketplaces were instantly transformed into a flooded land. The losses suffered by the people are incalculable. It is truly an unprecedented disaster. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shandongmen Breached: After the Danshuichi embankment was breached, the waters of Houhu approached the railway. The Shandongmen, located above the Charity Association, and the Shuangdongmen near Jisheng Wumalu became crucial pillars. The government also increased its defenses. Chen Keming, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, Fang Dazhi, Director of the Construction Department, He Baohua, Mayor of Hankou, and Wang Shiliu, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and others made regular inspections. Residents of Houhu, whose homes had been turned to ruins, gathered on the roads to assist in the rescue efforts. From the 29th, they guarded day and night without rest. On the evening of the 1st, the water level rose, and the Shandongmen and Shuangdongmen showed signs of imminent collapse. On the morning of the 2nd, the upper section of the Shandongmen suddenly breached, and over 500 refugees on the road were swept away by the raging torrent. The sounds of wailing shook the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>The Entire City Submerged: After the breach of Shandongmen, the floodwaters rushed in, swift as a whirlwind. From the Charity Association along Jisheng Wumalu, the Municipal Government, Sanxin Street, and other places, the houses were submerged to the rooftops, to a depth of over twenty feet. Zhongshan Road and Xinsheng Road were submerged to a depth of four or five feet. Traffic was immediately cut off, and shops were forced to close. People climbed onto rooftops or took refuge in trees, in a state of utter distress. He Chengjun, the Chief of the Military Affairs Office, Liu Wendao, the Director of Civil Affairs, and Xia Douyin, the Garrison Commander, immediately hired small boats and, together with the Charity Association and other organizations, went to the flooded areas to rescue the victims. Many were rescued and sent to the Fourth Bureau of Wuchang Cotton, Hemp, and Silk for shelter, and the emergency relief committee distributed food rations to alleviate hunger.</p>
<p>Maintaining Order: The Wuhan Garrison Command, due to the excessive floodwaters, and in order to maintain public order, submitted a request to the Military Affairs Office and declared a special curfew from the 29th of last month.</p>
<p>Puduo Mountain Special Announcement: We hereby announce that we have heard that some unlawful monks on our mountain are violating the precepts and intentionally causing trouble, hiding in Shanghai and colluding with unscrupulous merchants to sell all the tall buildings on the mountain to a certain country, hoping to obtain huge sums of money to return to secular life. But as this matter concerns international affairs, we must publish this notice to declare it. We humbly request all officials from all walks of life to pay special attention. Sincerely, the abbot and monks of Puji, Fayu, and Huiji Temples on Putuo Mountain.</p>

<p>From 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. the next morning, traffic was cut off. All embankment bandits were also captured, so the order was maintained stably. After the entire city was flooded, the department immediately dispatched security teams and armed police officers from the Public Security Bureau to organize patrol teams, who traveled to and from the streets in small boats, conducting strict patrols and deploying sentry posts, stationed in front of and behind the lanes, also staying in boats. If anyone was discovered taking advantage of the flood, they would be executed on the spot. At the same time, the Military Affairs Office also dispatched Deputy Officers Wang and Jiang, along with the Fourth Eighth Division military police battalion, to be stationed at the intersection of Minsheng Road and at the Zhongnan Hotel to suppress any disturbances.</p>
<p>Military Affairs Office Meeting: At 2 p.m. on the 2nd, Director He Chengjun convened an emergency meeting at the Military Affairs Office, attended by Xu Yuanquan, Supervisor of Bandit Suppression in the Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei Border Areas, Xia Douyin, Garrison Commander, Qian Dajun, Fortress Commander, He Baohua, Mayor, Liu Wendao, Director of Civil Affairs, Fang Dazhi, Director of Construction, Chen Keming, Director of Water Conservancy, Su Shi’an, Director of Public Security for the Provincial Capital, and Wang Shiliu, Director of Public Security for Hankou. They decided to establish a Disaster Prevention Office to protect public order, appointing Xu Yuanquan as Supervisor and Xia Douyin as Co-Supervisor. Yang Shaodong, Chief of Staff of the Tenth Army, and Ye Peng, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, were responsible for the arrangements. It was also decided that the Construction Department, Water Conservancy Bureau, and Wuhan Public Security Bureau would work through the night. After the meeting, Xu and Xia conferred and decided to temporarily set up the Disaster Prevention Office within the General Chamber of Commerce, delineate disaster prevention areas, and implement emergency measures. Special attention was also given to strengthening the protection of the Zhang Gong Dyke, which had not yet collapsed.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Price Gouging: With most shops closed due to the flooding, merchants of rice, coal, oil, and salt took the opportunity to profiteer, raising prices by more than double, causing great suffering to the refugees. The Military Affairs Office sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, instructing them to ensure fair prices, otherwise military law would be enforced. The letter stated, "Regarding the recent catastrophic flooding in Wuhan, a rare occurrence in sixty years, the disaster is extremely severe. Refugees from all areas have gathered in the three towns, suffering from the elements and enduring unspeakable hardships. In addition to the joint efforts of officials, merchants, and all sectors to provide relief, all merchants must consider the plight of the surviving refugees, act with conscience, and strive for fair prices to help alleviate their suffering. Therefore, we hereby request your esteemed association to inform all merchants to comply, jointly take responsibility, and avert this calamity. Anyone found taking advantage of the situation by raising prices, profiteering, hoarding goods, or deliberately creating scarcity will be dealt with according to military law without leniency."</p>
<p>Origin of the Disaster: This flood has not only affected Hankou but has also submerged many counties throughout the province. The main reason is that both the Yangtze and Han Rivers have risen, and downstream provinces have also experienced flooding simultaneously. The direct downpour was combined with the blockage of the drainage channels, so the situation became uncontrollable. However, according to other sources, the embezzlement of dike funds by local merchants, the lack of regular maintenance, and the official negligence and failure to carry out timely rescue efforts also seem to be contributing factors. The dike funds of Hubei Province were originally managed by a committee and were not to be used for any other purpose. However, several months ago, the committee's accountant deposited a large sum of several hundred thousand yuan with the Shifangchuanjiang Company, which was then embezzled, making it difficult to repair and strengthen the dikes. This flood had been brewing for a month, and there was ample opportunity to carry out rescue work, but due to inadequate rescue efforts, the breaches occurred. Tracing the origins, there is reason for regret. (August 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e66">After the Chelueba Dam Was Opened, There Was Also a Lake Tsunami <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Hongze, Gaobao, and Shaobo Lakes All Experienced Lake Tsunamis Simultaneously</p>
<p>Water Levels Were Over Two Feet Higher Than the Lake Dikes, Causing Extremely Severe Disaster</p>
<p>Yangzhou dispatch: The previous reports have detailed the situation of the rampant Yangtze River water and the mutual dispute between the people along the river bank who were fighting over opening the dams to protect the dikes. Unexpectedly, as of the 2nd, the Yumatou water level on the canal, which serves as a standard, has reached one zhang, eight chi, and eight cun, exceeding the level of the Chelueba dam opening in the tenth year of the Republic by one chi and five cun. At that time, the number of cracks along the bank increased daily, and by 2 p.m. on that day, several dike openings had collapsed one after another. If the dam was not opened again, the counties upstream would have faced an immediate and uncontrollable disaster. Therefore, a discussion was held with the people of Xinghua and other downstream counties who were present, saying that once a breach occurred, everyone would perish together. However, the people of those areas still did not agree, and some even brought their elderly and children and lay down on the dam to show their determination to fight to the death. This continued until 4 p.m., when the southwest wind suddenly intensified, and the water from the west of the lake slammed directly against the east bank, threatening to submerge even those guarding the bank. As a result, Director Wu, Director Mao, and other officials and gentry, in consultation with the county magistrates of Xingdongtai and other counties, persuaded the people guarding the dam to disperse and carried out the digging of mud holes. Thus, the Chelueba Dam, which had been contested for half a month, was opened at 4:15 p.m. on August 2nd. As for the losses suffered by the five counties downstream, it is not possible to estimate them at this time. After the dam was opened, the counties of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, and Baoying were just beginning to feel relieved when bad news came that night (i.e., 1 a.m. on the 3rd). The four major lakes of Hongze, Gaoyou, Baoying, and Shaobo suddenly experienced lake tsunamis simultaneously, with the water exceeding the dike by more than two feet. All the surrounding polder fields were submerged by more than ten thousand mu. The disaster area reached thousands of li. All the areas bordering the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, such as Shui Ba Township, Miaotou Wei, Tongxing Wei, Hexing Wei, and Changchun Wei, were transformed into flooded lands in a moment. The losses of people and livestock were immense. It is truly a rare disaster not seen in seventy years.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang dispatch: The water level in the canal within Jiangsu Province is still increasing daily. On the 2nd of this month, the Yumatou in Gaoyou rose another four cun, reaching a total depth of one zhang, eight chi, and eight cun. Although the workers have been making great efforts to rescue and maintain the canal dikes, they are still in imminent danger. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau recently received a telegram stating that the commissioners, directors of the Water Conservancy Bureau, etc., appointed by the provincial government and various departments met at 4 p.m. on the 2nd with the county magistrates of Gaoxingdongtai and other four counties to persuade the people guarding the dam to disperse and release the Chelueba Dam to the sea. The water flow was immediately very smooth, and the order was still good. This time, the canal dike has been submerged for a long time, and with the scouring of the wind and waves, the dike body must be greatly damaged. After the opening of the dam, the dam bottom will be damaged by the enormous amount of water. The amount of money required for the future follow-up project is conceivable. It is said that during the great water disaster in the tenth year of the Republic, the summer flood prevention rescue and post-disaster project cost reached one million yuan. In recent years, the counties have often used various excuses to intercept the mu loss for water management, and the amount submitted to the Construction Department has been small. In the 18th year, only more than 130,000 yuan was submitted, and in the 19th year, only more than 80,000 yuan was submitted. This year, after the abolition of the li, the 10% of the goods tax levied under the various tax offices in Jiangbei for water management has no funds. With the shortage of funds, the major water management projects have not been actively carried out. The funds for the spring repair and summer prevention of the canal dike have always been paid by the province. In this time of great water disaster, the rescue project cannot be done without a large amount of money. The Finance Department has repeatedly received telegrams from the Construction Department urging payment, and it is said that it has successively allocated 30,000 yuan and is still trying to raise money to meet the urgent needs.

<h3 id="e67">The Flood in the West River of Guangdong Province is Still Serious <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Allocates Another 100,000 Yuan for Relief</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: According to the latest investigation, the flood in Guangdong Province has been severe. All the West River basin, as well as the Beijiang River, have suffered infinite losses. At the moment, the Northern River has receded, and the Guangdong-Shaoguan Road can be normally open. However, the Western River has receded in limited amount, and the broken embankments are still a vast expanse of water. Although the highland areas have receded seven or eight feet in the past week, the upper reaches of the West River have been experiencing continuous rain in recent days, and the water level has risen. On July 28, the water in Zhaoqing Jinliwei rose eight or nine feet, and the flood was about to overflow the surface of the base. Farmers from all jurisdictions are rescuing day and night. The Jiujiang Sangyuanwei are now in imminent danger. The Guangdong Flood Relief Association has now reorganized the tenth relief team, and set off on the Guangdong-Shaoguan train on the 30th to Yingde and Qingyuan, carrying 50,000 catties of rice, medicines, and dry food. Overseas Cantonese in Shanghai have also remitted relief funds several times. Cai Chang of Dasing Company has remitted 10,000 yuan to the Cantonese Overseas Association's flood relief office and handed it over to the local Fangbian Hospital for collection. The Guangzhao Guild Hall has also remitted 30,000 yuan for relief, which was received by the water relief association on the 29th. The funds will be stored in the association and distributed separately. The government has also sent a letter from the Department of Civil Affairs to the Department of Finance to allocate another 100,000 yuan for distribution to the counties for disaster relief. The Department of Finance has allocated the full amount to the Department of Civil Affairs on the 26th, which will be distributed to the affected counties to claim for disaster relief. It is said that the Department of Civil Affairs believes that the disaster in Qingyuan County is serious. In addition to the 9,000 yuan already allocated, another 5,000 yuan has recently been allocated to provide universal relief. (July 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Heavy Rain in Xuzhou Causes Flood Disaster <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Water Depth on the Ground is Four Chi Three Cun</p>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: Since the heavy rain last month, the Yellow River in the east of Xuzhou has been flooded by the sudden influx of water from the upper reaches. The houses of the residents along the river have all been submerged. By the 12th of last month, the sky began to clear. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, the weather has been abnormally hot. At 9 p.m. one evening, dark clouds gathered, followed by thunder and lightning, and heavy rain poured down all night until it stopped on the morning of the 2nd. The low-lying areas in the city and suburbs were flooded to the knees. The water in the Six Western Towns was particularly severe due to poor circulation in the northwest. The representatives of the people in the Six Western Towns, Tan Xiaochun and others, numbering more than a hundred, formed a barefooted team and went to the county government, the Bureau of Construction, the Public Security Bureau, and the First District Office to inquire about disaster relief measures. Zhu Zhengxue, Director of the Bureau of Construction, and representatives from various agencies accompanied the petitioners to inspect the water situation in the northwest. After Zhu returned, he decided to first dig a ditch behind the county government as a temporary remedy to allow the water to flow freely. As for permanent plans, no decision was made. The Yellow River water level, although it had fallen before, is now higher than before. According to the Bureau of Construction's measurement, the rainfall was 138 millimeters, an unprecedented amount. The water depth on the ground is four chi and three cun. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Second Flood in Hefei <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The City Walls Were Washed Away in Seven Places</p>
<p>Hefei County, Anhui Province, experienced a great flood a few days ago, and the city inside and outside became a flooded land. After the small weirs along the lake and river were breached, the water level had receded by more than half. Unexpectedly, from the 22nd to the 25th, there was another heavy rain, day and night, causing the water level to rise six or seven feet higher than before. The mountain torrents on the west side poured down and flowed into the city through the Shuixi Gate and the Shuiguan. The Houjie of Duancitang, Ximaqiao, Weiyaguan, Xianqiao, Wanshougong, and the Chamber of Commerce became a flooded land. The Shangjie of the Ancient Tower West Street, Shangjie Lou, Mangrenxiang, Sanfangmiao Lane, and other major streets, the shops were all submerged, and the goods were soaked, causing great losses. On the east side, the lake and river tides poured into the city through the Dongshui Gate, dividing into three branches. The north side was flooded from Dadaongmen and Mingjiao Temple to the intersection of Shizijie and the north of Guyingqiao. The south side was flooded from Xiaodongmen and Sanpailou to Xiaoshuyuan. The middle side was flooded from Feiqichi, Jiushiqiao, and Tonghefang to the entrance of Donggulou Lane. The north gate was flooded to Siwan. The streets were four or five chi deep in water, and two or three chi deep in shallower areas. The area below Mingjiao Temple was particularly deep. However, the east and west waters were only a short distance apart. On the evening of the 24th, the city wall inside the Shuixi Gate and the Shuiguan suddenly collapsed for several zhang, and the sluice gate also collapsed, causing the water to surge forward and rush in, dividing into the Gu Louqiao circle, the most prosperous Dongdajie, and rolling down. The losses to the shops here were even greater. The vegetable gardens in Jindouwei, Duanhuayuan, Miaopu, and other areas in the city were level with the rooftops and drifted away completely. Fortunately, the county government urgently compiled wooden rafts to provide relief. There were few drownings. Outside the Shuixi Gate and the North Gate, the area was tens of li wide and endless. Outside the Dadongmen, Yangmatou, Maimaijie, Baibu’an, and Sanlitan, and outside the Xiaodongmen, Dawangmiao, Wenchanggong, Wu Jiao Xiang, and Zhou Gutui, the area was tens of li wide, a vast expanse of water. The houses all collapsed, and countless people and livestock were swept away. The Dongdawei, which was previously left as a sole survivor, was also broken. It is said that more than a thousand people were drowned during the rescue. The autumn harvest of the seventy-two weirs has become a pie in the sky. According to the self-defense group's investigation, the city wall has collapsed in seven places: four places from Fangshengchi to the Shuixi Gate, two places from the Shuixi Gate to the North Gate, and one place at Dadongmen, which is about six or seven zhang in the largest extent. At the moment, traffic in the four townships and the city is blocked by water. Every family in the city has collapsed walls and houses. Many people in the four townships have taken refuge in the treetops, hills, and highlands. The wails of the homeless, foodless, and landless are deafening. Most of them have been drowned by their families. Today, Deputy Division Commander Li, County Magistrate Zhang, First District Chief Liu Mingfu, Construction Bureau Director Wu Qingquan, and various public groups have begun to survey the flooded areas in order to report to the province for disaster relief and to appeal to the overseas hometown associations and Chinese and foreign relief societies to benefit the disaster-stricken people. According to the old people, this flood is the worst since the 22nd year of Guangxu.</p>

<p>The County Seat is Located in Longnan Town</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Donggu is located at the southernmost tip of Ji'an, about 120 li from Jicheng, straddling the border of Yongfeng, Xingguo, Jishui, Taihe, and five counties. All around, such as Longgang, Tantou, Shuinan, Chengkang, and Fulang Pit, are towering mountains and dangerous terrain. In the middle, there is the Gujiang River, which allows wooden rafts to pass through Ji'an. On both sides of the Gujiang River, there are about 300 square li of flat land, fertile fields, and residents in dozens of villages. Donggu Wei is located in the middle, with dozens of shops. During the previous Qing Dynasty, the area was also occupied by thieves, who killed and robbed, and the government could do nothing about it. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the Communist Zeng Tianyu occupied Wan'an, and the local bandits responded one after another. Donggu then fell into the hands of the red bandits. Zhu Mao also used it as a base, setting up a false peasant-worker revolutionary committee, the Gannan Special Committee, a military committee, the Jiangxi Soviet government peasant-worker bank, and a military political school. Last November, the counties along the Ganjiang River, such as Qingjiang, Xingan, Xiajiang, Jishui, and Ji'an, were successively recovered by the government forces. Subsequently, the Gong and Luo divisions met in Donggu from Ji'an and Taihe, with the 18th Division of Zhang Huizan stationed there. Zhang then submitted a petition to the provincial government, stating that Donggu was too far from the county seats of the five counties, making it difficult to control, so the red bandits were able to calmly occupy it and grow slowly. If it is desired to thoroughly eliminate them, the county seat should be re-established with Donggu as the center, and the Wende and Zhegui townships of Jishui, the Mingde township of Yongfeng, the Chunhua of Ji'an, the Xiancha of Taihe, and the Fengbian Baishichenggang of Xingguo should all belong to it. However, the provincial government only designated Donggu as a special administrative region due to the shortage of administrative expenses and appointed Xu Wenming as the commissioner of the region. Later, Donggu was again captured by bandits on New Year's Day this year, Zhang Shichang was killed in battle, and the administrative commissioner set up an office in Ji'an. It was not until the 27th of last month that Donggu was recovered by the government forces for the second time. The current party and government committee, in order to make the Gan people forever cherish their great achievements and forever be afraid of the red disaster, has decided to establish a county seat in Donggu to prepare for local rehabilitation in order to permanently eliminate the bandit roots. It is also said that it has been named Pingchi County, and the county seat is located in Longnan Town, 20 li east of Donggu, with jurisdiction over all of Ji'an County east of the Ganjiang River (from Yonghe Yangtian Xin'an Futian to Donggu), the Zhangjiadu, Shuinan, Baisha, and Beihu lines south of Jishui County, and the western part of Yongfeng County including Shaxi Hanxia, Junbu, and Nankeng. The committee is still awaiting consultation with the counties to determine the detailed boundaries. As for the candidate for the county committee chairman, Li Baozhong has been announced as the appointee. Li is a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy and is now</p>

<p>They Already Show Signs of Abandoning Ruijin</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: After the bandit suppression army recovered Donggu, Zhu Mao, Peng, Huang, and other bandits fled from Xingguo and Yudu to Ruijin. General Commander Jiang immediately ordered the various armies to attack Xingguo, Yudu, and Ruijin. Yesterday, on the 30th, they broke through Fangshiling, which connected Donggu and Xingguo, and captured and disarmed the remnants of Huang Gonglue's troops, numbering about 2,000, with about 1,600 guns. The city of Xingguo will also be taken in a matter of days. However, the Military Affairs Office recently received a reconnaissance report from an aircraft that the bandits who had fled from Donggu to Ruijin have recently moved west from Jiubao (about dozens of li west of Ruijin). All the bandits in Yudu and Xingguo have the potential to cross the Ganjiang River through Taihe and Wan'an and flee to western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan. The red bandits in Ruijin are only a small number of peasant bandits. Their main force is gathered between Yudu and Xingguo and is advancing westward very quickly. After receiving the report, General Commander Jiang immediately ordered the various armies to separately encircle and pursue the bandits from Xingguo and Yudu, and to deploy along the Ganjiang River to block their passage and prevent them from crossing the river.

<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Wang Chia-chen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Qingdao on the Dalian Maru from Shanghai on July 31st. This morning (the 2nd) at 7:00 AM, he took the Jiaoji Railway train to Jinan and then to Peiping. According to Wang's conversation with reporters, his mission in going north is to attend the International League of Nations conference in Geneva, and to visit Deputy Commander Zhang in Peiping to make some reports. Regarding the case of the Korean riot and the massacre of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest with Japan. However, the Japanese side, seeing the unrest in China and the inability to unite externally, is purely adopting a delaying tactic to wait for changes in the situation. If our country wants to win the negotiation, we must first quell the internal strife, and then unite from top to bottom, so that the Japanese have no opportunity to take advantage of, and this case will be easily resolved. As for the large amount of property of overseas Chinese in Korea, the returning overseas Chinese should still return to Korea to manage it and await a resolution from both sides. Furthermore, Shi Yousan's army is already surrounded on all sides, with the front line near Shijiazhuang, and it is expected to be resolved soon. (August 2nd)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: All circles in Fuzhou have recently felt unusually indignant about the Japanese atrocities in Wanbaoshan and various parts of Korea. On July 23rd, the Minhou County Party Headquarters convened representatives of various groups to hold a joint meeting, and it was resolved to organize the Fujian Provincial Capital All Circles Anti-Japanese Association. The Provincial Party Headquarters, the County Party Headquarters, the Minguo Daily, the Dongfang Daily, the Seamen's Union, the Yangwu Workers' Union, the Promote National Goods Association, the Women's Relief Association, the County Chamber of Commerce, the Provincial Fuzhou High School, and the County Minhou Junior High School were selected as committee members. On the 25th, the first committee meeting was held, and it was resolved to organize the method. There will be three standing committee members and four sections: General Affairs, Propaganda, Investigation, and Registration. On the 27th, the second committee meeting was held, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, the County Party Headquarters, and the County Chamber of Commerce were elected as standing committee members, and they began working immediately. The association has now resolved to stop the import of Japanese goods starting from August 6th, and at the same time notify various merchant guilds to investigate the current inventory of goods in the shops within the guild and register with the association, with a deadline for auctioning and clearing them. It also sent letters to the Lianjiang, Changle, Fuqing, Xiapu, and Ningde coastal county party headquarters to unanimously rise up, lead the people, organize anti-Japanese associations, and investigate and prohibit the smuggling of Japanese goods into the interior. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce also convened representatives from various trade associations on the 29th to discuss ways to stop the transportation of new goods and clear old goods. Therefore, the anti-Japanese atmosphere in Minyuan has been quite tense recently. However, the provincial government believes that during this period of bandit suppression and martial law, local order is extremely important, and it is sincerely afraid that bad elements will infiltrate and use foreign affairs issues to disrupt public security. Therefore, on the 28th, it specially sent Zhang Jingtang, the section chief of the Second Section, to the Provincial Party Headquarters to discuss solutions with Secretary Zhan Rufang, and three items were formulated: (1) Anti-Japanese movements in various places should be led by the Party Headquarters; (2) The boycott of Japanese goods should be handled with caution; (3) The name must be changed to the Foreign Affairs Support Association.

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Government has set up a Red Area Relief Association because of the severe disaster situation in the red disaster areas in the past. It has also organized a fundraising team. The association has now formulated a disaster situation survey form and distributed it to the counties that have been affected by bandits for investigation and reporting to the association, so that it can be distributed for relief separately. In addition, because the disaster situation is serious and fundraising is delayed, it is not enough to meet the urgent need. The Provincial Relief Committee also sent a telegram to the Central Relief Committee, saying: "The Red Bandits in Jiangxi Province were attacked by the Central Army and fled into Fujian. The counties of Minbei, Jianning, Taining, Shaowu, Guangze, Chong'an, and Jiangle have successively fallen, and they have committed arson, murder, rape, and looting, which is inhumane. We have previously telegraphed to request the allocation of huge funds to provide relief. We have also received a reply stating that we will discuss the allocation of relief funds after they have been raised. We have seen that your association cares about the people of Nanzhou and the coastal disaster victims, and we all sincerely wish you well. Now, the bandits have retreated from Minbei to Minxi, and Changting, Shanghang, Liancheng, and Ninghua have successively reported alarms, and the local area is in a state of disarray, and people are displaced everywhere. Even the refugees who escaped from Shaxian, Yong'an, Shunchang, and Nanping are in the tens of thousands. The association first raised 6,000 yuan and urgently sought relief, but the force is weak and the time is pressing, and we can only sigh helplessly. We earnestly request that your association approve the allocation of 30,000 yuan of relief funds as soon as possible, as in the previous telegram, to provide emergency relief. We urgently present our words and await your telegram." (July 30th)</p>

<p>Anecdotes of the Independent Second Division Interrogating Vengeful Ghosts</p>
<p>A Three-Year-Old Murder for Money Case is Cleared</p>
<p>Modern Spiritualists Should Study This</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Liu Donghai, a soldier in the Seventh Company of the Second Battalion of the Teaching Regiment under Zhang Ruigui of the Independent Second Division stationed in Shantou, recently suffered from severe muscle cramps in both knees. The bones in his lower legs were extremely painful, and his skin was blue and black, as if he had been beaten. He could not move. Zeng Ruisheng, the company commander, sent Liu to the health team for treatment. In the ward, Liu often felt haunted by ghosts at night, and his chest often felt oppressed by heavy objects, making it difficult for him to move freely, and he felt suffocated. Liu suspected that he was being haunted by demons and did not want to stay in the team, so he moved back to the company headquarters. After arriving at the company headquarters, although there were many soldiers living together, the haunting continued as before. After Liu fell asleep, it was as if someone stuffed his mouth with a face towel, or as if his hands were tied behind his back with iron wire. He often stared straight ahead and muttered to himself. Wang Xinfa, the squad leader, saw this strange situation and always woke him up. The soldiers in the same company also saw it several times. Therefore, the story of ghosts haunting the company spread throughout the army.</p>
<p>Company Commander Zeng Ruisheng has always prided himself on being upright, loyal, and brave. He has fought on the battlefield and camped in ancient temples in the wilderness and never believed that there were ghosts and monsters in the world. One night, he saw Liu's strange condition in the company headquarters and became curious. He jokingly wrote a text to summon the ghost to make a decision. He drafted a few lines, and just as he was about to light incense and burn it, Liu Donghai suddenly began to rave in his sleep, his voice and accent completely different from usual. Zeng quickly ordered the scribe to record what Liu said in his dream in writing to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Liu was originally from Qinlian, Guangdong Province. In his dream, he suddenly spoke in the local Guangxi dialect: "Speak! Won't you tell me about your evil deeds? It doesn't matter if you beat me to death. You also beat my brother and his wife to death. I will tie you up every night!" Company Commander Zeng was also horrified when he heard this and asked, "Who are you? What grievances do you have?" The ghost attached to Liu's body replied, "I am from Bobai County, Guangxi. What is your name?" He replied, "My surname is Liao, and my name is Kun, the Kun next to the fire character. My brother's name is Liao Qi." He asked what he did for a living, and he replied, "I do small business." He asked how many people were killed in his family, and he replied, "Two brothers and a new wife who was pregnant. I have been following him for three years. That day, I hit him with a stick, and he couldn't move anymore. After he killed us, he changed his name. There is also a military ticket. If you don't believe me, look at it." As he spoke, Liu unconsciously untied the leather bag on his waistband in his dream. Company Commander Zeng took the bag and opened it. Inside, there was a cloth collar badge of Wu Qihua, and a ticket with his name written on it.</p>
<p>Company Commander Zeng immediately promised to avenge Er's grievances, and Liu fell silent and snored like thunder. After a while, Liu woke up, and Company Commander Zeng asked him about what he said in his dream. Liu was stunned and didn't know. Zeng showed Liu what the scribe had recorded, and he lowered his head and said nothing. He confessed that three years ago, when he was the squad leader in Fan Dexing's regiment, his original name was Wu Qihua. He set out from Bobai County. One day, when he was on sentry duty at the junction of Hepu County, he saw two men with the surname Liao on the road, followed by a new wife, carrying 400 yuan in silver dollars. He immediately used the bayonet on his gun to stab the three of them to death and robbed them of the cash. The accomplices who committed the crime with him that day were still soldiers. Company Commander Zeng found out the truth. The petition for vengeance by the wronged soul has been confessed by Liu Donghai himself and cannot be disbelieved. He reported the details of that night and the sick soldier's confession to the battalion commander of the teaching regiment, who forwarded it to the division commander Zhang Ruigui, requesting that Liu Donghai, who had changed his name to Wu Qihua, be punished according to the law to uphold the law and comfort the wronged soul. At the same time, the division headquarters sent a letter to Bobai County, Guangxi, to investigate the truth of the matter three years ago, pending a final decision. (July 31st)</p>

<p>Dispute Over the Election of Provincial National Representatives: The competition among various district branches in our county for the election of provincial national representatives has been quite fierce this time. As of the 31st of last month, the preliminary election procedures have been completely completed. The 2nd was the date for the second election, which was held at the County Party Headquarters. The Provincial Party Headquarters sent Li Zhongqiao to Nanhui to supervise the election. On that day, one side's preliminary election representative, He Baoyi, and others claimed that many of the preliminary election representatives produced by the other side were illegal and requested that Supervisor Li declare them invalid. The situation seemed very tense. The County Party Headquarters stood guard with armed public security police, and temporary guards were stationed in the area near the headquarters. Although the representatives felt that the petition would not yield results, they were still able to maintain order and leave. At 3:00 PM, 17 representatives including He Bao went to report for attendance, but they were rejected. The other side then held a meeting and elected Zhu Jiming, Liu Ziquan, Chen Xizuo, Gao Keji, etc. as provincial representatives. Those who were rejected urgently telegraphed to the provincial headquarters, saying that there was evidence of electoral fraud and requested a swift investigation. It is not known how the provincial headquarters will resolve it.</p>

<p>Citizens Urge the Construction of a Memorial Stele for the Premier: The Yuecheng base in Ximen was previously designated by the County Party Headquarters as the location for building a memorial stele for the Premier. The Construction Bureau drew up plans and submitted them to the Construction and Civil Affairs for review and approval, and then forwarded them to the County Government for handling. However, the landowner, Mr. Wu, filed a complaint with the Executive Yuan, requesting that another construction site be selected to protect his property rights. This case was put on hold. Now, it is learned that Mr. Wu will build city houses on the site. Therefore, citizens Yang Xi, Lu Weixian, and others filed a complaint with the County Party Headquarters, requesting that they promptly supervise the construction of the memorial stele and stop Mr. Wu's building activities. The County Executive Committee believed that the citizens' requests were sincere and should be forwarded to the County Government for review. It is learned that County Magistrate Shen approved the letter and, in addition to replying to the County Executive Committee, ordered the Construction Bureau to suspend Mr. Wu's application for a building permit until the site for the inspection and survey by the Provincial Office has been determined. According to the case, the Director of the Jinshan Construction Bureau, commissioned by the Provincial Office, came to Songjiang for inspection the day before yesterday.

Although the weather has cleared up now and the water has gradually receded, the submerged fields and crops are withering. Many of the low-lying fields of cotton and rice that have been submerged and died have become barren land, and most of those that remain have only a few yellow leaves left on top. It is already close to autumn, and the growing season has passed. Even if there is rain and sunshine in the future, the harvest will be minimal.

<p>Bandits Rob Pawnshops in Broad Daylight: Bao Cheng Pawnshop, located on Dongmennei Main Street in Kunshan, was founded by the Shen family of Sanmaoge Lane in Suzhou and has been in business for decades. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM on the 3rd, more than ten pawnshop employees were having lunch in the eastern dining room. A bandit carrying a weapon suddenly jumped into the counter, robbed 65 yuan from the top counter drawer, and fled westward. The employees learned of this and chased after him, but the bandit had gone far away. Later, the shop employees telegraphed to the Public Security Bureau, the Detective Team, the Police Team, and the Chamber of Commerce for help. They searched everywhere. At 1:00 PM, the police team saw a person wearing the same clothes as the bandit outside Chaoyangmen. The team leader said that his name was Chen, that he was serving in the Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps, and that he was going to Zhoushi on business. He also had a badge.

Chambers of commerce and chamber of commerce federations that have already been established should be reorganized within six months after the implementation of this law. Since the chambers of commerce in various counties of our province have mostly been organized and established, and the provincial chamber of commerce federation is also stipulated by law, it should be reorganized according to law. In order to promote the common welfare of industry and commerce, it has submitted a proposal requesting the County Party Headquarters to forward it to the Provincial Party Headquarters to legally designate the chamber of commerce to convene a meeting on a specified date and be responsible for jointly organizing a provincial chamber of commerce federation.</p>

<p>The Adjudication of Party Cases Does Not Need to Be Transferred for Jurisdiction: Shi Minyong, the current Supervisory Committee Member of the County Party Headquarters, was accused by Tong Shizhong, a party member from Meili, of fraud. The Haiyu Daily, which published the truth of the case, was also attached. After receiving the complaint, the County Government approved "Wait for the summons to be verified." However, more than half a month has passed, and no summons has been issued. People in the community are paying attention. It is learned that County Magistrate Tan Yigui saw that although he had approved the summons, the complainant was a member of the Party Headquarters. Although the party and government organs were not subordinate to each other, the committee member and the county magistrate met every day in the same area. No matter how fair the case is handled in the future, there may be controversy from the outside world. Therefore, he voluntarily applied to the High Court for recusal and requested a transfer of jurisdiction. Yesterday, it was heard that the High Court had ruled that the Party Headquarters was not an agency under the County Government and that the Party Committee was not a civil servant. Therefore, there was no need for recusal, and the case could be handled according to law without transferring jurisdiction. It is said that the County Government will schedule a summons soon.</p>
<p>The Case of the Former County Magistrate Embezzling Funds Will Be Summoned Soon: Chen Meisheng, a local resident, because Zhuang Yan, the father of Zhuang Huaguang, the current Director of the County Finance Bureau, was suspected of embezzling a large amount of money during his tenure in Changshu, and the amount that has been found is already more than 11,000 yuan. He has requested the Supervisory Yuan, the Department of Finance, and the Suzhou High Court Procuratorate to investigate and pursue the matter according to the law and recover the embezzled funds. The Suzhou High Court Procuratorate has issued an order to the county, ordering it to investigate and handle the case according to the law. The County Government intends to schedule a summons for the plaintiff in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Construction Workers Will Sue the County Government: The County Government, in order to build a new prison, contracted with Gong Fengji for a bid of 21,000 yuan. It was to be built in accordance with the bidding regulations and construction details. However, there was an existing river pool on the site that had to be filled before a house could be built on it. This filling work and the piles were not specified in the regulations. Gong Fengji said that the bid price was already low, and requested that the County Government slightly subsidize the pool work materials that were not included. The County Government refused. Gong was unable to construct due to difficulties, so he applied to the county to withdraw the bid. The County Government ordered the second lowest bidder, Wu Zhongji, to undertake the construction, and fined Gong Fengji 120 yuan for delaying the project. Gong believed that the reason for withdrawing the bid was entirely due to errors in the regulations and had nothing to do with him. He refused to pay the fine. The County Government ordered the bailiffs to collect the fine within a time limit, otherwise he would be detained. Gong had no choice but to pay the 120 yuan to the County Government. At the same time, he filed an appeal with the Department of Civil Affairs, arguing that the County Government had subsidized Wu Zhongji's labor and materials and that the treatment was different.</p>
<p>The Party Headquarters' Election of Provincial Representatives Failed: The County Party Headquarters elected provincial representatives. Earlier, each district elected 21 preliminary election representatives. On August 1st, a second election was held at the County Party Headquarters. Chen Kanghe was dispatched by the province to Changshu to supervise. By the afternoon, only ten people attended, which was less than the legal number and could not hold the meeting. At around 4:00 PM, 18 people arrived. At that time, the County Party Headquarters feared that the violence that occurred at the election of representatives last year would be repeated. Therefore, it posted a notice at the door stating that only preliminary election representatives and staff members attending the meeting were allowed to enter. It also ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch more police officers to guard the door, which was very strict. Unexpectedly, at 4:20 PM, just as the meeting was about to begin, Chen Kanghe, the provincial supervisor, suddenly became ill, vomiting a lot, and announced the adjournment of the meeting. He was immediately sent to Changshu Hospital for treatment. According to Director Gu, it was likely acute gastroenteritis and he would not recover in a day or two.</p>

<p>The Gaozi Security Corps Fiercely Fights Bandits: The mountainous areas of Gaozi in the western countryside have always been areas where bandits come and go. The Security Office previously sent a team to search and suppress them, and a tip-off led to the arrest of bandit leader Chen Wenqi in Hangzhou, who was executed by firing squad. The people began to feel more at ease. However, although Chen was executed, dozens of Chen's followers still had guns that had not been seized. At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, they took advantage of the redeployment of the troops stationed there and gathered dozens of people to attack the Tanggang Security Corps in an attempt to seize their weapons. Fortunately, the security corps had been prepared in advance. After the bandits arrived, they fought bravely and fiercely. Three bandits were killed. The bandits were unable to resist and began to flee. Tong Jiasheng, the district chief of the area, is still afraid that the bandits will return and has telegraphed the County Government to request the Security Office to immediately send a team to search and suppress them to maintain security.</p>

<p>Huzhi, a Property Broker, Was Interrogated by the County: Ma Xianghe, an old farmer from Nan Village, Xinmiao, sold 180 dan of leased land for the Zhu family on Xueqian Street in the city last winter. It was then purchased by the bandit leader Zhu Luo Amei through various people at 44 yuan per dan. Ma Xianghe acted as the middleman. Later, when he learned that it was purchased by Zhu Luo Amei, he was afraid of being discovered and fled in fear of being punished. Now that the bandit leader has been executed for a long time, he has sneaked back to his village. Yesterday, he and his son A'da went to Yazhen Town to shop and were secretly reported to the army. The two Mas were arrested on the spot and taken to the county. Yesterday, Song, the trial officer of the County Government, opened a court for interrogation. Ma Xianghe confessed that he did not know the bandit Zhu Luo Amei and that Zhu, the accountant of the Zhu family, had mentioned in a teahouse in Xinmiao Town that he was eager to sell. He was motivated by greed and was willing to act as an intermediary. Later, Zhu's accountant gave him 40 yuan as a brokerage fee. All the land sales accounts were also transferred to him. His son Ma A'da confessed that he was not involved in the sale of land and did not receive any silver dollars. This time, he went shopping with his father in Yaqian and was arrested. Trial Officer Song ordered that the Zhu family and the accountant be summoned to the county for further interrogation. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Young Couple Commit Suicide by Poisoning: Chen Xiaoxia, a 23-year-old resident of Dashi Port, Zhuantang, Shangsi Township, Hang County, was a teacher in a rural primary school. Last spring, he married Shen Xiaxuan, the daughter of a certain Guotang line in Jiangan. Since their marriage, their feelings have been very deep. However, because he has been unemployed for a long time, his daily expenses are high. At first, he was supported by relatives and friends, but then he could not borrow money. He became tired of the world. The night before, he took advantage of the fact that no one was prepared and drank sleeping pills with his wife at the same time, hugged each other and went to sleep. At 9:00 AM the next morning, Chen's mother saw that the sun was high in the sky and that her children had not gotten up yet. She entered the room to check and saw her children sleeping together, their faces pale. There were two empty bottles on the table. Knowing that something was wrong, she quickly called the neighbors to gather two doors and carried them to Liuhe Hospital at the gate for treatment. However, the poisoning was already deep. When they were carried to the Sanfuren Temple in Xucun, they were both dead.</p>

<p>Foil Shops Sever Ties with Shanghai Shops Due to Tax Issues: Since the Shaoxing Foil Tax Bureau took over, the tax rates for various types of foil have been determined by the industry association and submitted to the tax collection bureau for approval. However, the Shanghai foil industry has raised objections to these tax rates, deducting nine or six cents per piece for tax and 4.8 cents for customs duties. Previously, Shaoxing appointed representatives, including Fu Xiao, and five others to go to Shanghai for negotiations, but the Shanghai shops insisted on the deductions, and no results were achieved. As this concerns the cost of materials, a meeting was convened yesterday, and it was generally agreed that the Shanghai shops were unreasonably coercing and deducting taxes, making trade difficult. It was decided that all members would temporarily sever ties with the Shanghai shops. Fearing that some might privately resume trade during the suspension period, twenty foil shops, including Zhen Chang, Cheng Tai, and Chang Chang, have sent letters to the Foil Tax Bureau requesting that the shipment of Shanghai foil pieces be suspended for tax reporting in order to find a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>New Resolution to the Anhui Province Reclamation Dispute: The land reclamation dispute in Anhui Province has been unresolved for over a year. The point of contention is whether the authority to reclaim land belongs to the Ministry of Finance or the provincial government. A month ago, the provincial government resolved to have the finance and construction departments, together with the director of the land reclamation bureau appointed by the ministry, draft measures to resolve the dispute. The departments and bureau immediately drafted eight measures and submitted them to the provincial government. The provincial government passed them at a standing committee meeting. The following is an excerpt of the measures: (1) Official properties and wasteland in Anhui Province, with the exception of those used by the military, camps, horses, schools, prisons, and those previously occupied or designated for use by provincial, municipal, and county departments, or those owned by government offices and houses under long-term rent collection, as well as pastures designated by the provincial government, shall be handled by the Official Property Reclamation Bureau, with the assistance of the county governments. (2) The county magistrates of each county shall, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, be appointed by the Official Property Reclamation Bureau in conjunction with the Finance Department to jointly manage the sub-bureaus. (3) The files of official wasteland previously received and kept by the counties shall be transferred to the official property sub-bureaus of each county by order of the Department of Civil Affairs. Those stored in the departments may be transferred at any time by official letter. (4) The examination and implementation of tax increases in each county shall be carried out in accordance with the tax increase regulations. (5) Land deeds for official wasteland that have been issued in the past shall remain valid. Those whose prices have not been cleared shall continue to be cleared by the province. (6) Land related to water conservancy shall be surveyed and managed by the Official Property Bureau in conjunction with the competent authorities. (7) The income of the Official Property Bureau shall be reported to the Ministry and the provincial government for record each month. (8) These measures shall be resolved by the provincial government and reported to the Official Property Bureau for filing with the Ministry.</p>

<p>Notes on the Interrogation of the Bone Theft Case: Although the Public Security Bureau has cracked down on the bone theft organization and captured the sorcerer, cases of bone theft in the four villages surrounding the city continue to occur several times a day, too numerous to record. On the 22nd, Yang Qiyou from Fengtai was caught by farmers stealing bones in Chen Henggang, Shuangdunji, in the northern countryside. He was handed over to the regimental bureau and transferred to the county. This afternoon, Section Chief She interrogated him. He confessed that he and eight accomplices stole bones from Shoujing and came to Hefei to work, specializing in stealing yellow and white bones and transporting them to Shanghai to sell to foreigners at a high price. After the interrogation, he was imprisoned. Regarding the old sorcerer, who is the focus of attention in this case throughout the county, this morning, Director Wang of the 46th Division Military Law Office, at the request of various public groups, interrogated the sorcerer Hu Youzhi, Zu Muheng, Shan Guoshi, Guo Nv, the landlord surnamed Lu, and Wu Jing, the person who introduced the rental of the house, all day long. Because onlookers were not allowed, the truth is unclear. However, the first district offices of various public groups have all held meetings and decided to petition for strict punishment of the sorcerer and the landlord.</p>

<p>Banditry Resurges in Sixian County: Sixian County in northern Anhui has always been a gathering area. In recent years, arson, murder, robbery, and kidnapping have caused great harm to the local area. Since the major bandits Wang Kunlun, San Mao Hou, and Zhou Hanzi were successively brought to justice, banditry had subsided, and the area had gained some peace. However, recently, a large group of bandits, numbering over two hundred, has suddenly appeared in the Xin'an area of the county, entrenched in Kuangjiawa, Wushankou, and other places. They are well-armed and extremely rampant. The bandit leader, Zhou Jiu, the younger brother of Zhou Hanzi, declared that he would attack the villages and fortresses north of the county to avenge his brother. The village chiefs of the eighth district believe that with the autumn harvest season approaching, if they do not quickly suppress the bandits, the situation will spread and become difficult to control. They have now requested troops from the county government to suppress them.</p>

<p>The Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences (formerly Zhijiang University) at Erlongtou, Zhakou, Hangzhou, has a picturesque landscape with mountains in the background and water in front. The school's facilities, such as the dormitories for male and female students, are exquisite and elegant. The classrooms have ample air and light. The sports field, swimming pool, and gymnasium are all well-equipped. Currently, a library and a science hall are being added, both of which will be completed in the autumn semester. The library is located on the Erlongtou mountain range, looking east to Liuhe Pagoda, west to Wuyun Mountain, south to the winding Qiantang River, and north to the towering Qinwang Mountain. The beautiful scenery will be the center of the school. When the project is completed in the future, it will surely be a famous scenic spot in Zhejiang, not just an academic repository. The science hall is also quite magnificent. The first floor is a chemistry lab, the second floor is an engineering lab, and the third floor is a physics and biology lab. Its location is between Severance Hall and West Hall, which is very convenient for students to travel back and forth. The school not only strives for development in material facilities but also strives to enrich the faculty. Many well-known professors have been newly hired. In the liberal arts department, the Chinese Literature Department originally had Zhong Zhongshan and Xia Cheng Chan, both well-known scholars in the field of Chinese studies. Now, Li Yan, the former Chinese professor and chairman of the Chinese Department at Xiamen University and National Wuchang University, has been added. The Economics Department originally had Li Pei'en and Hu Jiyuan. Now, Tang Qingyong, the former professor of commerce at Daxia University and Jiaotong University, has been added.

In addition, professors of English and engineering are being added. Most of the school's professors are full-time and live on campus, seeing students day and night, which has a familial spirit and greatly benefits students' studies and conduct.

<h3 id="e109">Is an Old Track and Field Event in China <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<h3 id="e110">Old Record: 11.20 Meters <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<h3 id="e111">Held by Meng Jimao <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Because the Far Eastern Athletics Games will use the sixteen-pound shot put in the next session, this year's National Games have also decided to follow the Far Eastern rules, abandon the twelve-pound shot put, and restore the old sixteen-pound shot put event in China. Recently, many newspapers have said that the sixteen-pound shot put is a new event and that China has no old records to refer to. In fact, this is not accurate. According to the regulations used at the beginning of track and field in China at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the sixteen-pound shot put was adopted in accordance with world regulations. In 1919, the twelve-pound shot put was adopted. It has been twelve years since then that we have restored the ancient event of our country. The first Far Eastern Games also used the sixteen-pound shot put. From the fifth session onwards, because China, Japan, and the Philippines felt that their physical strength was insufficient, the twelve-pound shot put was adopted. The adoption of the sixteen-pound shot put again in the next session is also a restoration of the original state and is by no means a newly added event. The highest records of the two shot put events in the Far East are listed below. Sixteen-pound shot put: Alavaris (Philippines), 11.34 meters, 4th session. Twelve-pound shot put: Shizuo Takada (Japan), 15.80 meters, 9th session. The highest record for the sixteen-pound shot put in China was 10.90 meters, held by Gao Siyang in 1913, created in Hongkou Park, Shanghai. The national record after that was 11.20 meters, set by Meng Jimao in 1919 at the Far Eastern Games in Manila, Philippines, on May 12 of that year. Meng participated in the third and fourth sessions of the Games and was selected for the shot put competition. From this, it can be proved that the sixteen-pound shot put is not a newly added event in China but is definitely an old one. The record of Mr. Meng should also be used as the standard for the new and old records in this year's National Games.</p>

<p>Establishes a Summer Training Camp</p>
<p>Location: Jinan University, Zhenru</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Track and Field Team has been established for almost a year now. The strength of its internal affairs and the completeness of its organization have been known to those who care about sports. There is no need to introduce it again. At the beginning of the summer vacation, in order to remind the people of the country to pay attention to track and field sports and to seek progress in technology, the team went north to Tianjin and Beiping, where it was invincible and returned triumphantly. The results of this trip were very satisfactory. The whole team was very disciplined and was praised by people in the north. It was also found that the expedition of the track and field team was unprecedented. Since the team returned to Shanghai in mid-July, the news has been quiet for two weeks because the team members have returned to their respective provinces. It is now learned that in order to prepare for participation in the city and national games, the team has specially borrowed the grounds and residences of Jinan University to establish a training class, which has been approved by the university authorities. It is also heard that the new German coach hired by the university will arrive in Shanghai soon. After arriving in Shanghai, he will be invited to serve as the honorary coach of the Jiangnan team. From then on, with proper guidance and hard work, it is expected that the effect of half the work will be doubled in this short period of time. It is heard that because the communication addresses of the team members have changed during the summer vacation, no further notice will be given. It is hoped that all team members will move to the university themselves after seeing the newspaper and bring their mosquito nets.</p>

<p>Accommodation Provided for All, Training for One Month</p>
<p>Promoting Sports is Invaluable</p>
<p>The Physical Education Department of National Jinan University, recognizing that track and field athletes in this city lack a place to practice, which will inevitably lead to a decline in performance this summer and affect the city's strength, a matter of great concern, has specially requested the school authorities to allow the establishment of a summer training class so that athletes can practice without interruption, thereby preserving their strength, which is truly beneficial to the city. It is heard that Secretary-General Fan of the university, who is passionate about sports, greatly approves of this initiative and has agreed to allocate a reception room to accommodate the athletes. However, this initiative of the university is purely voluntary. All participating athletes must have considerable achievements and be introduced by a legitimate organization. Accommodation will only be provided if those conditions are met. Athletes must also bring their own mosquito nets and canvas beds. As for guidance, Director Chen of the Physical Education Department will assign personnel to be responsible. Good news is that Mr. Han Ce, a German coach recently hired by the university, will soon arrive at the school to serve as an instructor for the class. This spirit of putting public interests before private ones is highly admirable. In addition, the university's basketball team is on an expedition to Xiamen, and the football team is being led and trained by veteran players such as Jiang Shanjing and Zhuang Shihong, occupying a position in the West League. Lianyingshai, located on the Qingyang Port bank of the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, is said to be the university's swimming training center.</p>

<p>Five Matches Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Five matches were held yesterday. Among them, the match between Guo Qida and Liang Guanying was the longest, with the two sides acting like toffee, going back and forth. Cheng Yize's smashes were of a higher level, but unfortunately, he still suffered from diarrhea yesterday and today, so he lacked stamina to maintain his advantage. Shen Baigui and Liu Keng were evenly matched. Mao Honggui and Wang Minshi did not finish the third set due to darkness and will replay the match another day. The results of each match are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e126">Request to Extend the Concession <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Large Headline in the "Dà Měi Evening News"</p>
<p>Chinese Request to the Municipal Council</p>
<p>A Request that Advisor Feitham Dared Not Make</p>
<p>Shanghai Western Merchants and Residents are Heartbroken and Frantic</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty, due to ignorance of foreign affairs, the government did not want Chinese and foreigners to live together, so it demarcated land in treaty ports for foreign merchants to reside in. Moreover, due to the incompetence of officials, they relinquished their administrative rights over the land, creating the concessions of today. As a result, foreigners issue orders and govern, reversing the roles of guest and host, causing the Chinese, within their own country, to be governed by foreigners, becoming a rare phenomenon in ancient and modern times. This has been the case for more than eighty years. Fortunately, in recent times, people's intelligence has been awakened day by day, and the movement to restore national rights is united from top to bottom, competing to recover lost rights. The British concessions in Hankou, Xiamen, and the Belgian concession in Tianjin have been returned one after another. Now we are engaged in the complete recovery. Yet, at this time, there is a request to extend the concessions, and it comes from merchants and residents in western Shanghai. Is this not a shocking and strange thing to hear? If this move came from foreigners or was fabricated by two or three stubborn foreigners, it could still be seen as their last struggle, merely earning them ridicule for not knowing the times. We would not find it strange. However, according to the headline in the "Dà Měi Evening News," it is proclaimed in large letters that "Chinese Request to the Municipal Council." If this news is indeed true, then these Chinese can truly be said to be heartbroken and frantic, willing to be foreign slaves. The people of our entire country must investigate this matter clearly and immediately correct it, lest it be passed down and spread abroad, making the world laugh, causing all 400 million of our compatriots to be ashamed, and giving Westerners an excuse to refuse to return the concessions.</p>
<p>According to the "Dà Měi Evening News," merchants and residents from Zhujiaqiao, Wangjialou (transliteration), and Shengjiaqiao (transliteration) in western Shanghai have jointly requested the Municipal Council to extend the concession to include the three places and the areas of roads built beyond the borders. They want to purchase land in Zhujiaqiao, Caojiadu, and Shengjiaqiao along Hongqiao Road to set up patrol police posts, lay tram tracks on Hongqiao and Bailinan Roads, pave the roads in western Shanghai into asphalt roads, add streetlights, and collect patrol police taxes from shops, residents, and factories on each road to fund the construction. The reasons they give for requesting the extension of the concession are that there are many factories in western Shanghai, and the number of shops and residences of Chinese and foreigners is increasing daily. The market is gradually becoming prosperous, but residents are greatly inconvenienced due to the lack of running water and streetlights, and especially because there are no police patrols, which often leads to robberies. According to this, such problems can be easily solved once the problem of roads built beyond the borders is resolved. If the Shanghai concessions can be recovered, it would be even less of a problem. Even Judge Feitham, hired by the Municipal Council to preserve the concessions, did not dare to openly advocate the extension of the concessions, but only proposed to form a Sino-foreign joint municipal authority in the areas of roads built beyond the borders. What do these merchants and residents see or what do they benefit from wanting to extend the concessions?</p>
<p>Association for Raising Funds for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces</p>
<h3 id="e127">Inaugural Meeting Tomorrow <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Address: City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Time: 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Recognizing that the recent floods have spread everywhere, causing severe disasters, leaving tens of millions of people homeless, prominent figures from the political and business circles of this city, such as Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Zhijiang, Wang Xiaolai, and Xu Shiying, have specially initiated the Shanghai Preparatory Office for Raising Funds for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces, and have scheduled the second preparatory meeting for today at 5:00 PM, and the inaugural meeting for tomorrow at 5:00 PM, to be held at the City Chamber of Commerce. The letter issued by the preparatory office yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice of Today's Preparatory Meeting: Respectfully inform you that due to the inaugural meeting of this preparatory office to be held at the City Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 6th, all matters must be actively carried out. It is scheduled to hold another preparatory meeting at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. We hereby send this letter and respectfully request your presence on time to discuss matters together. Sincerely wishing you well.</p>
<p>Notice of the Inaugural Meeting: Respectfully inform you that since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous rain, mountain torrents have erupted, and ditches and streams have overflowed. The provinces of Sichuan, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hebei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have all become flooded areas. The extent of the disaster is unprecedented in a century. Fields and houses are submerged, and people and livestock are swept away. The livelihood of farmers for a year is thus hopeless. All industrial and commercial sectors are also indirectly affected. If we do not urgently rescue them, then tens of millions of old, weak, and helpless disaster victims without clothes, food, or shelter will fall into ditches and gullies, and the strong will flee in all directions. The rebellious ones may even take risks. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. Therefore, we believe that the current floods in various provinces are of great social importance, and relief is urgently needed. We have specially united with various organizations and philanthropists to organize the Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces to save our groaning and suffering compatriots and fulfill our duty to help. We have now been organized and have scheduled the inaugural meeting for 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th of this month at the City Chamber of Commerce. We have also prepared a simple vegetarian meal to listen to your teachings. We have always admired your benevolence and concern for the hungry and drowning, and your willingness to raise your arms to rescue them. We believe you share our sympathy. We earnestly request your early arrival to provide full guidance and jointly plan the progress. With a hundred bows, we await your arrival and sincerely wish you well. Respectfully informed by the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces, Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, Du Yuesheng, Li Jin, Zhang Zhijiang, Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Shiying, Zhu Qinglan, Wen Lanting, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Qun, Niu Yongjian, Huang Qinglan, Shi Liangcai, Wang Zhen, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Yansong, Wang Boqi, Wang Xiaolai, Xie Hengchuang, Zhang Xiaolin, Liu Zhanen, and colleagues.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying's Telegram: The Shanghai Preparatory Office for Raising Funds for Emergency Flood Relief in Various Provinces received a telegram from Committee Member Xu Shiying from Nanjing yesterday, stating that he is scheduled to come to Shanghai today (the 5th) to attend the meeting on the 6th.</p>
<h3 id="e128">More Notes on the Flood's Obstruction of Navigation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Inland Rivers, the Yangtze River, Coastal Areas</p>
<p>The floods in various places have hindered navigation, as has been reported repeatedly in this newspaper. Although the weather has been clear recently, navigation, whether on inland rivers, the Yangtze River, or coastal areas, is still affected by the floods. The recent situation is reported again as follows:</p>
<p>Anhui Goods Cannot Be Transported: The import and export of goods to and from Wuhu in southern Anhui and Anqing in northern Anhui along the Yangtze River have been almost completely blocked by the various shipping companies in this city due to the impact of the recent floods. The reason is that the wharf boats in both ports are already full of passengers and goods, and inland transportation is isolated by the water, making it impossible to load and unload. Therefore, in recent days, the various Yangtze River steamers in Shanghai have stopped loading goods to Wuhu, Anqing, etc., and the arrival of goods from the two places has also been cut off.</p>
<p>Shenjiao Steamer Blocked from Returning: Inland river steamers have been blocked and stopped by the flood for almost a month. The China Merchants Bureau's Shenjiao regular steamer started a trial run on the 3rd in preparation for resuming service. Unexpectedly, when the ship reached the Baihedang area, it was stopped by the water surveyors sent by Qingpu County and was not allowed to proceed. The ship returned to Shanghai as before. Qingpu County has now issued a notice stating that small steamers to Qingpu and Zhujiajiao will only be allowed to operate on a trial basis starting on the 6th. Therefore, the goods and passengers on the ship were all transferred to be transported tomorrow.</p>
<p>After the Hengtong Sank: The accident of the Hengtong small steamer sinking in Bihuba, Shaobo, has been reported previously. It is now learned that the ship was carrying a battalion of infantry from Liang Guanying's 25th Army to Qingjiangpu. The people on board initially thought that it was very dangerous to operate the ship at night, but they were violently beaten by those forcing the ship to sail. They were then forced to set sail, which resulted in a collision with a civilian boat's iron anchor, causing the ship to break and sink. The soldiers have now been transferred from Shaobo to Qingjiang, and the China Merchants Inland River Bureau has reported the truth of the accident to the Zhejiang Construction Department, requesting that they prevent the forced sailing of ships during the flood period.</p>
<p>Difficult to Unload Goods in Hankou: The flood in Hankou has not completely receded. Yesterday, various shipping companies in this city received another telegram from Hankou, stating that the water in Hankou is even greater, with some low-lying warehouses being flooded to a depth of six feet, and even higher warehouses being flooded to a depth of one foot. All goods arriving in Hankou are being unloaded onto barges and cannot be directly loaded onto the warehouses. Those who had taken early precautions mostly used sandbags and mud to build enclosures to block the water. In recent days, the goods going to Hankou from this city have been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Difficult to Navigate Baihe River: The Baihe River in Tianjin is silted up, with a draft of only eight feet. Shanghai-bound commercial ships such as Fusheng and Xinfeng have successively run aground due to silting at Tanggu Port. Although the water has risen recently, the silt has also increased, making navigation even more difficult. When the Shunlun arrives at Tanggu, it also runs aground. It has now been towed out. At present, ships arriving in Tianjin are all in Dagu, first transferring the goods before proceeding to the port.</p>

Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, and mountain torrents have caused dozens of large and small dikes to collapse one after another. The fields have become flooded areas, and the streets are like lakeshores. In recent days, there have been violent storms and heavy rains. Waves of three to five zhang high rise suddenly, like overturning the sea and moving mountains. For hundreds of li, sand and stones fly, directly pressing the sky and rolling the earth. Starving people are everywhere, and their faces are emaciated. Relief is urgently needed. Please help." (2) A telegram from fellow villagers from Wuwei Province states, "The Huangsitan embankment in Wuwei County has collapsed, and hundreds of embankments in the county have collapsed at the same time. People, livestock, and fields have been tragically swept away. The disaster is overwhelming, and the sound of crying shakes the earth. Please urgently provide relief to save 800,000 dying disaster victims." (3) A letter from the Dangtu County Red Cross Branch states, "Dangtu is located on the Yangtze River and is low-lying. Since the beginning of summer, there has been heavy rain, continuously for days. Mountain torrents have poured down, and the rivers and lakes have risen sharply. The water is several feet deep on flat ground. In addition, the strong wind has broken all the embankments, turning them into a vast expanse of water. People, livestock, houses, and farm implements have been swept away. The sound of weeping is unbearable to hear, and mourning geese are everywhere. Relief is urgently needed. Please find a way to provide urgent relief to save the situation." (4) A letter from the Woyang County Government states, "This year, there was continuous rain in early July, and there were heavy rains on the 18th and 23rd and 24th, coupled with storms. The entire county was flooded, and seedlings and houses were swept away. The sound of crying is tragic. At the moment, there is no food or grass, and people are crying for food. Please provide relief." (5) A letter from the Dingyuan County Chamber of Commerce states, "Since the beginning of July, the county has been hit by continuous rain, day and night. Within the city, the streets have become canals. In the rural areas, mountain torrents have erupted, turning everything into a flooded area. Settlements have been razed to the ground, and people and livestock have drowned one after another. Houses and tombs have been washed away. The exact number of deaths cannot be determined. It is estimated that there are currently more than 20,000 to 30,000 households homeless and waiting to die. Please allocate large sums of money to provide urgent relief to save the survivors." Also, a letter from the Kunshan County Farmers' Association in Jiangsu Province states, "Kunshan County has been hit by torrential rains for the past half month, day and night. Livestock have been swept away, seedlings have been submerged, and embankments have completely collapsed. The fields have become flooded areas, houses are leaning, and people lack food. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in decades. Please raise emergency relief to relieve the suffering."</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Rubber, Hardware, and Car Parts Industry Association yesterday, stating, "Regarding your association's letter stating that some members have branch stores in Jiangsu, and asking whether the business tax can be paid together by the main store in Shanghai, and requesting verification and reply, we have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for an explanation. We now forward the reply from the Ministry of Finance, numbered Fu Zi 6737: 'We have received your telegram. Shanghai is a city directly under the Executive Yuan and is not within the administrative area of Jiangsu Province. Separate regulations have been formulated for the collection of business tax, and they have been submitted to the Ministry for revision and forwarding for compliance. For various businesses that have a main store or main factory in Shanghai and branch stores or branch factories in other provinces, the business tax should be collected separately. Article 15 of the Regulations for the Collection of Business Tax in Jiangsu Province is not inconsistent. The information mentioned in your telegram is slightly misunderstood regarding the separate handling of provinces and cities.' We hereby forward a copy for your information."</p>

<h3 id="e134">Two Courts to Officially Open Tomorrow <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court officially began operations the day before yesterday and held a court session, hearing eight urgent criminal cases.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Yesterday, there were no urgent cases, so the court did not convene, but the internal organization has been largely completed. The two court presidents and two chief prosecutors visited various local agencies at 9:30 yesterday morning and scheduled to visit foreign agencies in the area this morning. Tomorrow, the court will officially open to hear civil and criminal cases. The situation yesterday is recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Visiting Various Parties Yesterday, Liang Renjie, President of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, accompanied by Chief Prosecutor Peng Wangye, and Ying Shi, President of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, accompanied by Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, took a car at 9:30 AM to visit the Municipal Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Office, the Shanghai Local Court, and various bureaus and offices under the Municipal Government. This morning, they will visit the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the French Concession Municipal Council, and the consulates of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. However, the French Consulate is a return visit because the French Consul General Gankerin visited the two courts yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Opening Tomorrow The two courts issued a notice stating that they would officially open tomorrow (the 6th) to hear civil and criminal cases. The internal organization has been largely completed, so it is decided that the court will open on schedule tomorrow to officially hear civil and criminal cases. At the same time, the court will begin accepting petitions. Although the French side has not yet provided a list of the cases transferred from the former French Public Concession Court, it will not hinder the commencement of case hearings. According to President Liang Renjie, the French side will deliver this list around the 6th.</p>
<p>Request to Dispatch Guards Because the two courts need guards for protection, the Local Court sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting the dispatch of nine police officers (four for the High Court and five for the Local Court) to be stationed at the two courts. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Since our court was ordered to be established, it has been fully received on August 1st and officially established. It has leased No. 1 Fang, Xuehuali Road, French Concession, as its office. From now on, it will begin operations. For the sake of careful defense, we plan to request your bureau to dispatch nine police officers to be stationed in the court to guard the police district. We are sending this letter to request your approval. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Notifying All Sectors After the two courts were officially established and began operations the day before yesterday, they sent letters to various local agencies yesterday, the original letter being the same as the notice of August 1st, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Local Court Judges According to President Liang, the previously published list of judges of the Second Special District Local Court contains many errors and is not complete. The revised list is as follows: Ying Shi, Chief Judge of the Civil Division; Judges Pang Shurong and Qu Cengze; Ge Zhitan, Chief Judge of the Criminal Division; Judges Luo Renji and Xiong Huiping; Zhu Ganlin, Judge of the Civil Summary Court; Shao Mengtong; Ma Shounan, Judge of the Criminal Summary Court; Wu Fanglian; Zhang Jinjian, Judge of the Civil Enforcement Office; Clerk Xiao Jinfang. The list of staff in each department will be published today, it is said.</p>
<p>Consultant's Office Du Gejun, consultant of the Jiangsu Second Special District Local Court (i.e., the former assessor and vice consul of the Mixed Court), has established the Second Special Court Consultant's Office in the Public Concession Engineering Bureau at the Grand Clock on Gongguan Road after being appointed by the court. Mr. Vidal, the French head of the former French Public Concession Court Procuratorate, is the head of the Judicial Section, and Mr. Wu Chongguang is the Secretary-General. Operations began on that day. It is also heard that Fei Xizhen and Gu Shouxi, the acting lawyers of the French Police Department, have also established offices there for convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Resolution of the China-Europe Shipping Dispute <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Freight Rates Rise Again Opportunistically</p>
<p>In the early spring of this year, a fierce shipping dispute occurred on the Shanghai-Europe route. At that time, freight rates were reduced competitively and rebates were abused, and Japanese ships further disrupted the situation, resulting in an unregulated chaos in the European line. For several months, all shipping companies suffered. Now, the Dutch shipping company, the main instigator of the dispute, has realized that this move is a mistake, so it has stopped the fierce competition and is willing to cooperate with other shipping companies. European shipping has returned to its original state, and export freight rates have now been announced to increase. The results of the investigation are recorded in detail below. This is closely related to international trade and China's foreign export business.</p>
<p>Dutch Ships Rejoin the Association The Dutch East Asia Shipping Company, managed by the Java Company in Shanghai, operates on the Shanghai-Europe route to England, France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. It has more than 20 ships of six to seven thousand tons each, traveling between China and the Netherlands. Various foreign ships on the European line have formed an association, which sets the rise and fall of export freight rates, which should be observed by all. Dutch ships are also members of the association. This year, the company declared its withdrawal from the association in early spring due to poor export business, intending to be unrestricted and able to freely reduce prices in order to attract more cargo. At that time, after the company withdrew from the association, it greatly reduced freight rates. The shipping companies in the association also collectively agreed to reduce prices in order to prevent Dutch ships from taking advantage. As a result, export freight rates on the China-Europe line were reduced by one-half or two-tenths after this incident. For several months, the Dutch shipping business has not improved at all due to the joint reduction of fees. Export business is worse than before. The income after the price reduction is even less, and the losses in recent months have been considerable. Now, the company has realized that the previous proposal was a mistake, so it has asked the association to rejoin as a member, expressing cooperation. The association submitted this matter for discussion, and the shipping companies also felt that accompanying the price reduction was not a good idea, so they allowed it to join as a member. Thus, the dispute was resolved.</p>
<p>Increase in European Freight Rates After the association resolved the issue of the Dutch ship joining the association, it proposed to increase the export freight rates from Shanghai to Europe immediately in order to make up for the previous hidden losses. With the unanimous agreement of the representatives of the shipping companies, the association renegotiated the freight rates for various goods. Some rose by two-tenths of the original price, while others rose by six-tenths. Yesterday, the agreement was reached, and the new freight rate list was distributed to the members, ordering them to implement it immediately. The shipping companies have now notified the export customers. The new price list is specially recorded as follows (the unit in the table is ton, A price is without commission, B price is with commission):</p>
<p>Commodity A New Price Original Price B New Price Original Price</p>
<p>Shillings Shillings Shillings Shillings</p>
<p>Ore 32 27 35 30</p>
<p>Egg Yolk 68 45 75 50</p>
<p>Mineral Seedlings 45 41 50 45</p>
<p>Peanuts 61 45 68 50</p>
<p>Pig Bristles 100 80 110 90</p>
<p>Waste Hemp 54 50 60 55</p>
<p>Ramie 54 50 60 55</p>
<p>Waste Cotton 32 25 35 27</p>
<p>Wet Albumin 58 36 64 40</p>
<p>Egg Powder 68 45 75 50</p>
<p>Packed Wool 58 54 64 60</p>
<p>Poria Cocos 90 81 100 90</p>
<p>Five Pecks of Seeds 100 72 110 80</p>
<p>Hair 68 47 75 52</p>
<p>Pig Hair 100 81 110 90</p>
<p>Cowhide 58 41 64 45</p>
<p>Pig Intestines 100 72 110 80</p>
<p>Tung Oil in Bulk 68 54 75 55</p>
<p>Also in Barrels 68 50 75 55</p>
<p>Oils 61 54 68 60</p>
<p>Tobacco 50 38 55 42</p>
<p>The above are all price increases. However, cotton cake has been reduced in price, from 32 shillings to 27 shillings, because very little of this cargo is shipped to Europe. The above commodities are major exports, so the freight rate dispute has been settled. From yesterday, shipping companies will charge according to the new prices.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Printing Industry Still Not Back in Operation Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Workers Resuming Work Still Implementing Eight Hours</p>
<p>Employers Refuse and Send Representatives to Petition Again</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Summon for Questioning Today</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Printing Industry Association notified all colleagues to suspend business, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered them to resume work immediately and scheduled a mediation today. However, all colleagues refused because the workers were still implementing eight-hour work days. Therefore, they are still suspended. The information obtained yesterday is recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Stop Suspension The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Printing Industry Association and the Printing Industry Workers' Union: "Order to comply with the matter. Although Article 8 of the Factory Law stipulates that the working hours of workers shall be eight hours in principle, it also allows exceptions to extend to ten hours. Moreover, whether the factories in the industry are all subject to the Factory Law is still under investigation. The labor and management of the industry suddenly stopped working due to the issue of working hours, which is inappropriate. In addition to separate orders, we urgently order you to comply, quickly resume normal work and wait for this bureau to investigate and verify, and do not violate the order. Important order."</p>
<p>Petition Again After the Printing Industry Workers' Union received the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau the night before last, it immediately notified all workers that night to resume work as usual from yesterday, but still implemented eight-hour work days. As a result, all workers went to work one after another. However, all employers insisted on nine-hour work days, otherwise they would all be refused and driven out, and the workers' meals and accommodation were stopped. Upon hearing this, the union sent Qu Shou Kang and Wang Xingquan to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department to petition. Zhang Shuye and Huang Zaoxiong received them and gave a detailed account of the employers' refusal to work and eviction, requesting immediate mediation. The Printing Industry Association sent Zhang Yixin, Zhu Kehou, Wang Wenxian, and Chen Bingxi to the Social Affairs Bureau again at 3:00 PM yesterday to petition, reporting that the union had illegally notified them to continue working eight hours and requesting a strict order to stop this and stating the difficulties of not being able to work eight hours.</p>
<p>Official Investigation The Garrison Headquarters, the Political Department of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, all sent personnel yesterday to investigate the truth. The Printing Industry Workers' Union sent a letter to the Engineering Bureau yesterday, saying: "Inquiry: The printing industry unrest this time was caused by the illegal shutdown of the employers, not by the improper actions of the workers leading to a strike. The responsibility issue should belong to the employers. After the employers stopped operations, they evicted workers, sealed the factory doors, etc. In order to protect local security, our association led all workers to take orderly actions and wait for the party and government agencies to resolve the issue. We are sincerely afraid that your department will misunderstand. We will first send a letter to explain in detail, and we hope that your department will not obstruct it and provide appropriate maintenance within the possible scope. We are very grateful."</p>
<p>Questioning Today The Social Affairs Bureau notified the Printing Industry Workers' Union and the Printing Industry Association yesterday: "Notice: According to the union's presentation, for the request to mediate the treatment conditions, this bureau has scheduled to convene a questioning session at 1:00 PM on August 5. We hereby notify you to appoint two responsible representatives to come to the bureau to wait for questioning. Special notice."</p>

Those who are already ill will be restricted and sent to the temporary epidemic hospital in the area for isolation and treatment to prevent the spread. The Municipal Health Bureau has also dispatched one more doctor and one nurse to assist in the treatment work.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Li Bohan's Discussion of Foreign Merchant Title Deeds <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Li Bohan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Real Estate Association, regarding the issue of the Engineering Bureau Real Estate Board and title deeds. According to him, the land valuation in the Public Concession has always been presided over by Westerners, which is quite unfair. This association advocated that Chinese people should be hired for the Real Estate Board, and the Engineering Bureau has already accepted this, as seen in the bureau's gazette. However, the procedures for submission are currently being studied to comply with Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Regulations. In the future, land valuation in the concession will be held once a year, which is closely related to Chinese owners. The reporter then asked about the foreign merchant title deeds. He replied that the Shanghai foreign merchant title deeds originated from the Yangjingbang Land Regulations established in 1845. Foreign merchants who want to lease land must negotiate a price with the Chinese owners who hold the title deed and enter into a perpetual lease with a description of the terrain and address. The consulate will forward it to the Shanghai Daotai for verification and seal it, and then return it to the holder, which is called a title deed. Later, Chinese people who wanted to acquire real estate also entrusted foreign merchants to come forward, obtain the title deed, and then have the foreign merchant issue a letter of trust, noting that a certain Chinese person entrusted him to register, which is called a power deed. This kind of deformed title deed is rare in all countries and has been going on for decades. Recently, it has become even more serious, so that there are only about 5,000 acres of title deed land in the concession that have not been transferred to title deeds, and most of the title deed holders are Chinese. Chinese people pay a large amount of donations and increase the tax amount of foreign merchants, with responsibility but no rights, which is regrettable. As for its disadvantages, in small terms, untrustworthy foreign merchants often steal and sell the property that Chinese people entrust them to register, and there is no way to prosecute them, which is not uncommon. In large terms, if any foreign merchant country and China encounter similar events such as severance of diplomatic relations, the foreign merchant title deeds of that country will be confiscated or returned, and the land rights of Chinese people who entrust registration are likely to be lost. Usually, Chinese owners regard title deeds as the most reliable, and there may be a day when they are helpless. Fortunately, Mr. Wu Jingxiong, an advisor to the Engineering Bureau, has recently paid attention to the issue of foreign merchant title deeds and has a proposal to study solutions, which is a very important plan. The reporter also asked about improvement methods. He replied that the deformed title deeds held by Chinese people are caused by the unequal treaties signed under duress at that time, and there is no room for existence in principle. However, the current progress can only refer to suitable methods and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate amendments to Articles 35 of the Yangjingbang Regulations.</p>

<p>The Deceased Was Yang Lao Si</p>
<p>Had a Fight with Someone Last Month</p>
<p>There May Be Other Circumstances</p>
<p>Reported by the Teahouse Owner</p>
<p>At about 8:00 PM last night, a man was shot to death by random gunfire near the telephone pole at No. 44 South, Hongnanshan Road, Republican New Road, Zhabei. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Body Examination At 8:30 PM last night, the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau received a report from Xiao Jingqi, the owner of the Daxing Teahouse at No. 209 Hongnanshan Road, stating that someone had shot a pedestrian on Republican New Road. Patrol Captains Luo Mingqi, Cheng Jun, and Chen Ruichun immediately led police officer Cao Lizhen to investigate. They saw the deceased lying on the side of the road wearing a white shirt and shorts, a straw hat on his head, blue embroidered slippers on his feet, a leather belt around his waist, a bundle of pickled vegetables, a black fan, and a bag of nails, all scattered on the ground. There was blood everywhere. There were multiple gunshot wounds on his left leg, knee, back, and forehead. Because it was at night, it was not very clear, but there were about ten gunshot wounds in total.</p>
<p>Family Report While they were investigating, the deceased's family arrived after hearing the news and cried over the body. The deceased's wife, Yao, reported that the deceased's surname was Yang, named Lao Si, 40 years old, from Yancheng, and currently unemployed. He lived at No. 3, Huikang Lane, South Railway. There were two wives in the family, and no brothers or sisters, and no parents or children. Yao, 37 years old this year, and her sister (referring to the deceased's concubine) work in silk factories to make a living. He went out at 4:00 PM today to see his friend Xiao Jingqi at Hongnanshan Road, and he was shot to death for some reason. According to the deceased's concubine, her mother's surname is Lu, 21 years old, and she became acquainted with the deceased in June of this year. When she was 19 years old, she cohabited with Mao Fengxiang, who now lives in a thatched shed next to the Daping Glass Factory on Yongxing Road, behind the Sun Temple. The deceased had a fight with Ye Zigao, who now lives in a thatched shed near Xiaohong Temple on Republican New Road, last month. There may be other circumstances.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Investigation After obtaining the statements, the police chief and others went to the Daxing Teahouse on Hongnanshan Road to investigate. According to the owner of the teahouse, Xiao Jingqi, the deceased arrived at his store at 4:30 PM and went to the Xinyixing barber shop next door at about 5:00 PM. At about 8:00 PM, I suddenly heard gunshots. I went out to watch and learned that Yang Lao Si had been shot to death. I immediately ran to report to your police station and went to the deceased's home in Huikang Lane. The deceased and I are friends. He came to my place today to collect usury. I don't know anything else. Later, Police Chief Luo took the deceased's wife Yao, concubine Lu, and reporter Xiao Jingqi to the station and sent them to the Fourth District for interrogation. The body was guarded by Jin Ertu, the local bailiff Wang Shaoting. Today, he will be ordered to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy and try to arrest the murderer. At 11:10 PM, Ye Zigao was arrested. He claimed to be a 37-year-old from Zhenjiang and was immediately sent to the district for interrogation.</p>

<p>Due to the recent reconstruction of the new house, the Yongji Construction Factory at No. 135, Mansinan Road, French Concession, was hired to sub-hire Foreman Lin Liusheng, who currently lives at No. 61 Ziyang Lane, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, to supervise the workers to demolish it for days. At 10:30 AM yesterday, while they were working, the large wall on the east side and a part of the house suddenly collapsed. The workers were unable to avoid it, causing Foreman Lin Liusheng and workers Qin Rusan and others to be buried under the rubble. The foreman Niu Yaoqi called Gang Police Fan Caisheng and reported to the fire brigade, which drove to the scene and rescued the injured workers. They were first sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The injured workers included Qin Rusan (47 years old, from Gaoyou, leg injury), Zhao Yougao (36 years old, from Gaoyou, head and leg injuries), Wang Jinshan (23 years old, from Gaoyou, left leg injury), Yu Jiawu (18 years old, from Gaoyou, head and leg injuries), Li Anan (20 years old, from Gaoyou, head and leg injuries), and Yu Linlin (44 years old, from Yongren, left hand and head injuries). However, Renji Hospital examined the injuries and refused to admit them according to regulations. They were only bandaged and given medicine and then discharged from the hospital. Because none of the workers had families in Shanghai, they were transferred by the First Branch of the Second District to Xu Erkang Injury Hospital in Dongjiadu for continued treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Shuai Songping Sentenced to Death <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Wives and Concubines Covered Their Faces and Wept Upon Hearing the Verdict</p>
<p>Shuai Songping, from Jiangxi, formerly served as a senior official of the State Council, a member of the Jindong Relief Office, a advisor to the Anhui Governor's Office, the general manager of the Anhui Tobacco, the manager of the Jiangxi Water Company, the manager of the Yuanhong Well Drilling Company, the owner of the Datong Unity Daily, and a commander in Feng Yuxiang's army. After leaving the political arena, he acquired concubines in Ping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and owned many cars, which was extremely lavish. Later, because his private savings were exhausted and he could not maintain his life, he became a kidnapper. The kidnapping of Lu Shaotang, the comprador of the Fair Foreign Company, last year was done by Shuai. At that time, Lu's bodyguard, the Russian Madi Sida Du, was shot and killed by bandits. Later, it was solved by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate, Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Tanmu Feng Zhiming, Wang Ying, and Bao Tan Wu Hanzhang, who arrested many kidnappers and handed them over to the Special District Court, where they were sentenced to death and life imprisonment. Shuai was also arrested. The procurator Ruyibaoyi of the Police Department cited the law on punishing kidnappers and the crime of murder and prosecuted him in the Special Court. The interrogation has ended and awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Xu Jiashi, the chief of the Criminal Court, opened the court and sentenced Shuai Songping to death for kidnapping and extortion with premeditated murder. Deprivation of public rights indefinitely. Shuai's wives and concubines, Shuai Jinghua and others, also attended the court. Upon hearing the verdict, they all covered their faces and wept, which was very pitiful.</p>

Lu Chengyao, the manager of the factory, entrusted Fu Rongze as his representative to contact the counselor and swindled a huge sum of money. Lu and Fu both fled without a trace. After reporting the case, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent detectives to find out that Lu and Fu were hiding in the concession. They immediately consulted the Special District Court and issued a warrant to summon them. However, Lu fled after hearing the news, and only Fu was arrested. Fu also claimed that he had joined a foreign nationality. The court has now issued an arrest warrant and notified the British and French police stations yesterday to arrest Lu Chengyao for interrogation.

<h3 id="e150">Forensic Examination Institute to be Completed Soon <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice decided to establish a forensic examination institute in this city to handle examination matters and specially appointed Sun Kui Fang as the director of preparations. After receiving the commission, Sun came to Shanghai last summer when the First Special District Local Court was established and attached the preparatory office to the court to begin preparations. The court's examination cases were also handled by Director Sun along with the forensic doctors. Later, the Ministry of Justice, considering the urgent need for the establishment of the examination institute, allocated a large sum of money, ordering Sun to purchase several mu of land in Yangjia Bridge, Zhenru Town, and hire workers to build the institute through bidding. After half a year, the construction is nearing completion. The content is roughly divided into two parts: (1) Hospital, (2) Examination. The autopsy office of the Public Concession will also be attached to the forensic examination institute. Originally, autopsy matters in the Public Concession were handled at the autopsy office on Faelun Road. However, as the office was built by the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, the court had to pay a certain amount for each corpse examination. If Western doctors were required to perform surgery and autopsies, the cost would be even higher. Although this money was used to cover the expenses of the office and its hospital, the annual expenditure for the court was surprisingly high. Now that the examination is moved to Zhenru, this expense can be avoided. Director Sun is currently stationed at the site, directing all arrangements, as the construction of the institute is nearing completion and the internal layout still needs to be arranged. In addition to the existing forensic talents, it is said that more will be hired and are currently being sought. Although the official opening date has not been determined, it should be in the near future. Autopsy matters in the First Special District will be moved there after the official opening of the institute. From now on, the important policy of examination can be said to follow in the footsteps of justice, break away from foreign influence, and become transcendent and independent.</p>

The building plans have been drawn up and submitted to the Engineering Committee of the bureau. After being approved by the Municipal Council, bids will be invited for construction.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Rectification and Issuance of Fishing Boat Flag Licenses <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Han, the former director of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police, believed that imported fishing boats were inevitably mixed with good and bad elements. Therefore, he drafted measures for issuing flag licenses to eliminate bandit traces. The proposal was approved by the 379th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee. The Fourth District Department then hired boats and sent personnel to conduct inspections. However, the flag license fees collected exceeded the prescribed amount by more than ten times, and even extra demands were made, which caused great suffering to the boat owners. Since Jiang Chaoxiong took over as the director of the Fourth District, he realized that the previous method of hiring boats and sending personnel was not perfect and was prone to abuse. However, as the case was related to eliminating bandits and had been approved by the provincial government, it should be continued to maintain the authority of the law. In order to fundamentally eliminate abuses, he ordered the 16th team of the district to continue handling the matter temporarily, conduct serious inspections, and issue fishing boat flag licenses according to regulations. According to the regulations, each flag license only charges a material fee of four jiao, and no extra demands are allowed. If there is any obstruction, once discovered or accused, it will be strictly investigated. Team Leader Zhang Zongliang has begun to implement the inspection since yesterday after receiving the order.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Supporting the Hua Chang Paint False Accusation Case <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Confiscated Paint Can Be Returned Soon, Detained Personnel to Be Released</p>
<p>Feixing Brand Sanitary Paint produced by Hua Chang Oil Mill is made from useless scraps of leather and chemical solutions. It is used to paint utensils, making them bright, durable, and odorless. It has long been approved by the Central Sanitary Testing Institute as non-toxic and issued a certificate. The National Trademark Registration Bureau of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce approved Feixing as a trademark. Since its introduction, it has been favored by various sectors of the country. Unexpectedly, the Hangzhou branch of the factory was falsely accused by someone in the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department of using sanitary paint as a substitute for opium. On July 17, the Civil Affairs Department confiscated hundreds of cans of paint and detained two employees. The next day, they sent personnel to Shanghai, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police and Yangshupu Police Station, to investigate the factory on Huasheng Road. As a result, no contraband was found. After the incident occurred, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, and the Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, after inquiring, believed that the sanitary paint produced by the Hua Chang Factory had long been approved by the government and was non-toxic. They sent telegrams to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs Department to investigate thoroughly in order to protect national goods. Yesterday, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce also telegraphed the Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs Department. The telegram said, (omitted above) "The Hua Chang Factory has been in operation for many years, and its products have been tested and certified by the Central Chemistry Institute, so they must be non-toxic. According to the factory's letter, (omitted in the middle) it seems to be true. We hereby request your government and department to investigate and return the original items, and punish the false accuser to clarify the truth and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. We hope so." It is also reported that the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, after receiving telegrams from various groups in this city proving the case, will return the confiscated paint and release the detained personnel soon.</p>

<p>Measures to Deal with the Property Owner</p>
<p>Taiyuan Lane, Zhangjiaxiang Road, Hongkou, was completed in January of this year. However, after the residents moved in, the street lights in the lane had not been installed. The residents negotiated with the property owner without success. On June 2, the property owner suddenly cut off the water pipes in the lane and stopped supplying water. The residents reasoned with him, but the property owner avoided meeting them. They submitted a report to the Municipal Government, which instructed the Municipal Public Works Bureau to investigate and handle the matter. It is reported that the street lights in the lane have been installed by the property owner. In terms of water supply, the bureau ordered the property owner to connect to the Zhabei water supply before August 10 to facilitate residents' drinking. Otherwise, the residents will handle it themselves, and the required expenses will be deducted from the rent. A notice was also issued to the residents for their information.</p>

<p>Caused by Anger from Dismissed Teahouse Employee</p>
<p>Wang Yongshan, the manager of the New Stage in Mongol Road, Zhabei, received two extortion letters on the 24th and 25th of last month, demanding 100 yuan. The letters instructed Wang to leave the money in a paper basket under the telephone pole at the tram stop of the 18th Road at the Garbage Bridge on the 27th. After receiving the letters, Wang immediately reported the case to the First Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. The police chief ordered plainclothes officers to go to the designated location to wait, but there was no movement. On the 29th, Wang Yongshan received another letter, signed "Unemployed," with similar wording to the previous letters. The police station sent people again, but still to no avail. On the 2nd of this month, Tang Ziliang, a shareholder of the New Stage, received another extortion letter with a postmark from Daji Road, Ximen, demanding 1,000 yuan. The letter instructed him to wrap the money in red paper and send it to the back of the water pillar at the entrance of the Continental Bank No. 2 Warehouse at the New Garbage Bridge at 1:00 AM on the 3rd. After receiving the news, the First Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau ordered the manager of the New Stage to submit all the account books and compare the handwriting in the letter. It was found that the handwriting was similar to that of Hu Chengtang, the teahouse employee who had been dismissed from the stage. It was also learned that Hu often went to the Pinfang Teahouse on Mongol Road to drink tea. Therefore, the police went to the address at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd and arrested Hu. Under interrogation, Hu confessed that he was caused by the oppression of Wang and Tang. After being dismissed last month, the deposit of 30 yuan had not been returned. Out of anger, he resorted to this strategy. He also claimed that he did not go to collect the money after sending the letters and did not know that he had violated the law.</p>

<p>Hu Baogen, also known as Sheng Baida, from Changzhou, fled to Shanghai the other day to evade a kidnapping case in his hometown and hid in the Kunming Hotel at No. 35 Kunming Road. Xue Renquan, a detective from the local Public Security Bureau, learned of this and followed him to Shanghai. He reported the case to the Huishan Police Station and requested assistance in the arrest. The police chief sent Chinese Detective Cao Xirong No. 665 and a secret Chinese officer to arrest Hu and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Court of the Special Court. According to Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, the defendant denied that his other name was Sheng Baida and that the name on the arrest warrant did not match. The police station requested the Wujin County Government to provide conclusive evidence that the defendant had committed kidnapping and extortion in Changzhou. There was no objection to the transfer of the case. Subsequently, Detective Xue Renquan testified that the defendant was known as Sheng Baida in the Beimen area of Changzhou, and many accomplices had also been arrested. He then presented the official letter for inspection. The defendant claimed that his real name was Hu Baogen and that he did not have the alias Sheng Baida. He denied committing a kidnapping case in his hometown. Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confession and ordered the case to be postponed to the morning of the 11th of this month for the Wujin County Government to provide evidence for further verification. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Inspection of the Murder of Wife in West Shanghai <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Shen A'gen, a farmer residing at No. 5, Jinjia Lane, North End, Caohejing Town, West Shanghai, killed his wife He a few days ago. This has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that the murderer Shen A'gen is 31 years old. His first wife, Hu, died of illness in August last year. In the winter, Shen A'gen spent 200 yuan on a tea gift to marry He, a woman from Chongming, as his second wife. The couple was still in harmony. However, Shen A'gen suddenly suffered from mental illness in March this spring. He spoke incoherently, was capricious, and talked to himself all day long. There were no unusual signs before the incident. In addition to A'gen and his wife, there were only his widowed sister-in-law Wang and two young nieces in the house, but they had already separated. Wang and her two daughters lived in the east end of the hall, while the deceased lived in the west end. There were no neighbors. Wang made a living by selling vegetables. Every morning at 3:00 AM, she carried a basket to the market. Therefore, A'gen must have killed He around 5:00 AM. Later, A'gen ran around in front of the house, looking like a madman. At that time, it was already dawn. The villagers went to the fields to hoe weeds. When asked why he was wandering here, he said he was selling dead people's heads, 300 yuan each. Then a member of the clan entered the house, calling for his wife He. He walked to the door and saw that He had been killed on the ground in a pool of blood. He then reported to the Sixth District Third Branch. Officer Yuan and Chief Wang led the police to the scene. When the murderer saw the police coming to arrest him, he jumped into the river and fled. He was caught by the police officer Fu Congdian in the river after six or seven rivers. He was taken back to the station. After Chief Liu's preliminary trial, Shen A'gen spoke vaguely and did not answer the questions. It was observed that there were many wounds on his body. Yesterday, a written statement was prepared and sent to the bureau for interrogation. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Prosecutor Wu Deying appointed by the court brought the examiner to the scene for examination. It was found that the deceased's neck was cut with a knife, the trachea was severed, and the head was about to fall off. There were also many knife wounds on the arms and chest. It was determined that she had been stabbed to death. The coroner ordered the family to collect the body and await further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Anti-Opium Association Issues Declaration Yesterday <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Seventh Anniversary Today</p>
<p>Today is the seventh anniversary of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Association. Since its establishment, the association has made remarkable achievements. Considering that there is still much work to be done in the future, and the progress of the cause depends on the support of the people of the country, a declaration is issued to state the feelings of the past year and the hopes for the future. The declaration of the association is as follows: "On August 5th of the 13th year of the Republic of China, this association was entrusted with the will of 400 million compatriots and maintained by the strength of more than 40 organizations. It was born in response to the times and bears the mission of developing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's anti-opium instructions and eliminating the scourge of opium in order to clear the black terror. For seven years, this aspiration has not been slackened. We have used the analogy of floods and fierce beasts to awaken the people of the country, and with tears of sorrow, we have used firmness to unite the people's will. The promotion of the anti-opium movement has been far-reaching. Internally, we have cultivated the public opinion against opium, and externally, we have aroused the sympathy of friendly countries, so that the rampant spread of opium has not reached a state of inhumanity, and opium merchants have not dared to be without fear. This small achievement, this association dares not exaggerate, nor dare to hide. It is necessary to provide the public with real facts for national judgment. However, as the sky asks for misfortune and human desires flow, opium, which is recognized by the world as a tool for destroying the country and exterminating the race, is regarded as a source of profit, like flies chasing stench and ants clinging to rancidness. As a result, our people engaged in anti-opium often sigh that the more they try to control the situation, the more chaotic it becomes. The so-called 'The Tao is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high,' we deeply feel this pain. In this harsh environment, although this association has been full of thorns and difficult to walk, we have sometimes hesitated and thought of giving up. But at the thought of the association bearing a great responsibility and the people's earnest expectations, we cannot help but immediately become excited and angry, and engage in a bloody battle with the evil forces again. The association and anti-opium comrades in various places are devising ways to defeat the enemy, while the enemy is also rising up to engage in a large-scale union. Celebrities, officials, local vendors, opium merchants, and even local bullies and hooligans, all gather under the same opium protection banner to fight against the people who sincerely adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions. Their power is strong, their conspiracies are endless, and they often use imperialism as their backing and government officials as their confidants. If we uncover the inside story of the major opium cases in the past, there is hardly a case that does not involve these characters, or even the main actors who perform on stage. In the case of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs seizing a large batch of opium from the Kloseau, Japanese people are engaged in this business, German ships are financing its transportation, and government offices are protecting it. Therefore, many incidents have occurred, but there has been no official disposal of the opium, and there is even news of a full refund. In the case of the false accusation against Mr. and Mrs. Huang Jiahuai, the secretary-general of this association, celebrities who advocated public sales of opium, local vendors who poisoned the country, colluded to trap them, and senior officials also sat in conspiracy to implement the opium public sales policy. Those who advocated this were medical doctors and opium suppression officials. Those who expressed their agreement were government tax collection agencies and local tyrants who relied on opium for a living. This association, considering this move as a dead end for the country and a black luck for China's doomsday, ran around calling for help, vowed to oppose it, and the opium suppression authorities deceived and acted deceptively. They immediately concealed the name of opium public sales and changed it to the Opium Suppression and Investigation Office to forcibly implement it. Since its establishment, strange phenomena have emerged, and foxes and dogs have occupied important positions. The ruffians and local merchants have become officials. This is an unprecedented and bizarre phenomenon. This association, lamenting the worsening situation and the increasingly fierce trend, believes that a bloody battle to the death is imminent. Without any regard for ourselves, we raise our arms and shout, rushing and pouncing. Fortunately, the people's hearts have not died, and public opinion is still strong. The people are united and respond as one, competing to make serious representations to the government, stripping the villainous souls of rebellion, and the opium suppression authorities are also afraid of the people's feelings and the need to ease the atmosphere. They resolutely abandoned this policy, and then there was a clear order to abolish the Opium Suppression and Investigation Office. Recently, according to rumors from various sources, the advocates of public sales, because their ambitions have failed, have not been able to achieve their long-cherished wish to be promoted and make a fortune. Because their evil intentions have not died, they have repeatedly proposed new schemes and have re-recommended the establishment of a Narcotic Drug Administration. The name is more clever, the evils are more numerous. In the past, it was only limited to the public sale of opium, but now it will also include morphine, heroin, and all narcotics for public sale. The so-called medical doctor is insane and has gone so far. Alas, Heavens, who is he? With the desire for profit from one or two people, he wants to sacrifice the future of the party and the country and the lives of 400 million compatriots. Isn't this a heinous crime? This association has always adhered to the policy of eliminating evil and is determined to suppress opium, maintain the spirit of rejecting opium, and develop Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions. It vows to fight this group of people who fatten themselves by selling opium. From now on, no matter what kind of opium suppression measures with public sales characteristics violate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, this association also vows to resist with all its strength. It must be known that the disaster of destroying the country and exterminating the race is imminent, and there is no room for us to stand by and watch. If people do not harm beasts, beasts will also harm people. It is better to be a broken jade than a whole tile. We hope that next year today, this association can comfort the people of the country with the most satisfying text, with the quickness of the scourge of opium being eliminated or sharply reduced. This depends on the future efforts of this association and the actual support of the people. This declaration is made."</p>
<h3 id="e164">Hanyeping Registers Shares <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Office of Hanyeping Coal and Iron Mining Co., Ltd. yesterday notified the shareholders, saying, "Since the establishment of the company, the shareholders' meeting has never been convened, and the board of directors has never been produced. The illegal and disciplinary actions should have been corrected long ago. However, the company authorities are helping the evildoers and leading the wolves into the house. They dare to hand over the full power of the company and the production of the entire mine to others, betraying the country and harming the sovereign. This is it. In order to safeguard national rights and property rights, and to protect the interests of shareholders, our colleagues have warned Sheng to notify the shareholders and disclose the news to the newspapers. We hope that you will be aware of this. However, Sheng Ze Cheng is unrepentant and ignores our warnings. Our colleagues have no choice but to sit idly by. In addition to formally requesting the government to handle the matter according to legal procedures, we hereby notify all shareholders that all shareholders holding shares of the company shall register their shares with the Hanyeping Shareholders Joint Office on the fourth floor of No. 106 Sichuan Road, starting from today. Our colleagues have made a declaration in advance that the matter concerns the safety of the country and disregards personal interests. All internal and external negotiations will be carried out to the best of our ability. We must restore our old belongings and continue to express our sincere intentions. We ask for your public judgment."</p>

They have sent circulars to provincial and municipal governments to establish fishery police bureaus in fishery areas to maintain the order and safety of fishery areas and protect the interests of fishery. It is reported that after receiving the circular, the municipal government believes that it is necessary to establish a fishery police bureau in this city and has begun active preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Examination of the Former Anti-Japanese Association's Accounts <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Committee Met Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal made by members at the previous general meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate the accounts of the former Anti-Japanese, National Salvation, and Joint Associations, it was resolved on the spot that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should send a letter to the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid Committee to publish the accounts of the former association, and appointed Chen Songyuan and eight others as members of the audit committee. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the committee members gathered to discuss the procedures. Chen Songyuan, Zheng Jian'san, Wang Lianfang, Zheng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, and others attended. Zheng Chengqing reported that the Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid Committee had replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that there were no accounts to be published for all the accounts of the former two associations, and that the current association had no relationship with the former association. Finally, Zheng Jian'san, Wang Lianfang, and others proposed that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce request the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to order the chairman of the previous Anti-Japanese Association to be responsible for announcing it in order to maintain national integrity and dispel public doubts. Other matters were discussed before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responds</p>
<h3 id="e167">Lending Interest Practices of Silver and Money Businesses <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday responded to Certified Public Accountant Jiang Xin Zhao, stating that it had previously received a letter regarding the handling of interest disputes on loans, and listed two points for inquiry regarding the regulations and customs of the silver and money industries, requesting a reply for reference. After forwarding letters to the Silver and Money Businesses Association of the city, the Money Businesses Association replied on July 31, stating, "(1) The interest rate for regular loans in the money industry, unless there is a contract stipulating otherwise, is determined at the discretion of the market based on the urgency of supply and demand. Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Shanghai Money Industry Business Regulations stipulates that the maximum interest rate for inter-bank lending among the same industry is 7 mace per thousand taels. Article 7, Paragraph 4 stipulates that the outstanding interest is based on the interest on current deposits, with each member adding discretionarily. If the interest on current deposits is less than 4 taels and 5 mace, it is still based on 4 taels and 5 mace. Although there is no fixed standard for the so-called discretionary addition to the current deposit interest, there must be a verbal agreement between the bank and the customer. (2) The settlement period for regular loan interest in the money industry, unless there is a contract stipulating otherwise, is once at the end of each month. The interest settled in the previous month is added to the principal of the current month for compound interest calculation." On the 3rd of this month, the reply from the Bankers Association stated that the bank's regular loans are mostly contracted. There are also methods that imitate money shops, discretionarily adding 4 taels or 4 taels and 5 mace, which depends on the market, although there is no fixed standard, banks and customers must have a verbal agreement. The settlement period for interest, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract, is generally every six months or twelve months. If the principal and interest are not cleared, the interest is included in the principal for compound interest calculation. According to this, the respective replies are recorded and provided for review and filing.</p>

<p>Since the continuous plum rain in this city, the weather has been cool, and watermelons are on the market, but few people patronize them, resulting in a sharp drop in prices. Each load is sold for only two yuan, and because there is too much rain, the watermelons are not sweet. Therefore, watermelon vendors are suffering. In recent days, the weather has suddenly changed, and it has become extremely hot. Watermelon vendors are having great luck. Yesterday, the price of watermelons on the market was actually seven yuan per load, and there were very few goods arriving. The watermelon vendors made three times the profit and returned with smiles on their faces.</p>

It is now known that the family members of the apprentice felt the virtue of the doctor's cure, and specially made a plaque to thank him.</p>

<p>Jail Overcrowding</p>
<p>The new Sing Sing prison in America is the most famous prison in the world. Recently, the number of criminals has been increasing day by day, so that the number of prisoners has increased sharply and can no longer be accommodated. All short-term criminals are in the open space inside the big walls, and temporary tents are set up for them to stay temporarily. They will be released upon the expiration of their terms. All those living in prison cells are long-term prisoners.</p>
<p>British Widows After World War I</p>
<p>During the World War, the number of people who sacrificed in the participating countries was alarming. Even in the UK alone, it was not in the minority. The widows of the soldiers have no clothes or food and have to remarry. According to the investigation, in the past ten years, there have been 100,000 women who have remarried one after another. However, there are still 145,550 who have not remarried. They rely solely on the government to issue pensions to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>British Waiters</p>
<p>According to those who pay attention to social conditions, the waiters in restaurants and cafeterias all over the world, with British waiters as the first. Even the famous French waiters cannot reach them. Why is that? Because they interact with guests, they have a gentlemanly demeanor. Every move is very polite.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Nanchang Anecdotes <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Ye Bai</p>
<p>The suppression of the Red Army is in full swing. Large armies are gathering in Jiangxi. Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang himself came to Gan to supervise the suppression, there are even more important party-state figures going to Gan on official business. The traffic of officials is endless. The number of civilians in the bandit areas who have fled to the province is even greater. Therefore, the new capital of Hongdu is extremely lively. I will record what I have seen and heard to tell the readers.</p>
<p>House Famine With the rise of the Red Army, Nanchang is full of agencies. Although the various armies have set off for the front, most of the offices and garrison offices are in the provincial capital. The families of general staff and temporary refugees are too numerous to count. Therefore, public and private houses ○ are all overcrowded. Compared with the capital, the situation is even worse.</p>
<p>Careful Inspection In order to strictly prevent bandits from mingling in, the authorities have been inspecting travelers with extraordinary seriousness. Car and boat docks, pay special attention. I accompanied Liu Ruiheng, a member of the National Government and chief medical supervisor of the headquarters, to Gan. When I got off the car in Nanchang, even though I presented Liu's business card and pass, it took several negotiations to avoid inspection. Its seriousness can be seen.</p>
<p>Anxiety Over Imaginary Problems The places where the Red Bandits entrenched themselves were burnt, killed, raped, and plundered, and it was dark. Only the order in the province was still extremely peaceful. The citizens came and went, doing nothing. Recently, the suppression of the Red Army in the front has been a great victory, and people's hearts have become more secure. A friend of mine was transferred to Gan to work a month ago. Before leaving, his wife was afraid of the communist disaster and returned to her original home in Shandong. After Mr. came to Gan, he saw that the situation was so quiet, he laughed at his wife for being too timid and good at worrying about imaginary problems.</p>
<p>Merchants Lucky During the suppression of the Red Army, many important and secondary figures from all sides came to Gan. There was a lot of drinking and revelry. The seats at Jiabinlou and Puyunzhai and other places were often full. The various ice drinking rooms are also ten times more profitable. In addition, Jiangxi's special products, porcelain, summer cloth, and camphor wood boxes, those who are in their place will choose to buy several things as souvenirs, or to give to relatives and friends. Therefore, the lives of general porcelain shops, summer cloth shops, woodworking shops, etc. are quite good. However, general entertainment venues such as cinemas and theaters have stopped operating due to the suppression of the Red Army. This is also fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>The Electric Light is Blind, the Telephone is Deaf Nanchang's electric lights and telephones are not well managed. Telephones are very difficult to get through. The light of the electric lights is extremely weak. Sometimes auxiliary candles are needed. Therefore, Nanchang has the saying "the electric light is blind, the telephone is deaf". During this period of suppressing the Red Army, the work of all departments is very tense. The electric lights and telephones alone remain the same. Its conservative spirit is also worthy of many.</p>
<p>Maps are selling well The Red Bandits are extremely vicious, and everyone hopes that they will be eliminated as soon as possible. When the various armies are cooperating in the siege, they are extremely concerned about the military situation in the front. Everyone has a map in their hands to understand the progress situation. Generally, those who come to the province for the first time buy more Nanchang maps because they are not familiar with the roads. When I arrived in Nanchang, I asked many bookstores before I bought a map of the counties of Jiangxi. The maps of the provincial capital are all said to have been sold out long ago. The extent to which the general public cares about the situation can be seen from the sales of maps.</p>
<p>Lushan is affected The Lushan Mountains are a summer resort. Every summer, many Chinese and foreigners climb the mountains to escape the heat. This year, due to the suppression of the Red Army, people from all walks of life who passed through Xunyang took the time to climb the mountains. The road to Guling is twice as lively. The great mountains have suddenly increased so many uninvited guests. It is also affected by the communist disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e192">New Kidnappers Who Redeem Ransom the Same Night <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Kidnapping has been prevalent in Shanghai for years. However, in recent years, such kidnapping cases have been spreading daily. Even in remote rural areas, they are heard of daily. Recently, in the area of the Mao River at the junction of Songjiang and Qingpu, kidnappers are becoming increasingly rampant, with kidnapping cases emerging one after another. The various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Situation: The kidnapping cases that have occurred in various villages near the Mao River this time are roughly the same. The number of people involved is about seven or eight, or more than ten. They come in a small boat in the late night or dusk. The weapons they carry are only three or four short and long guns. However, the villagers are unwise and lack the ability to resist. Moreover, even if there are kidnappers in the neighboring house, they will close their doors and not ask about it.</p>
<p>Definite Informants: Kidnappers must have local informants to act as accomplices, leading them into the village. Therefore, when kidnappers enter a village, they are familiar with the roads. They also know everything about the wealth and poverty of ordinary farmers. Some say that there must be a geomancer as a guide.</p>
<p>Ransom Redemption the Same Night: It is said that these kidnappers have no den. When kidnapping people, they can take action as soon as they seize ships along the way. After kidnapping the "God of Wealth", they wait outside the village and instruct people in the village to come to negotiate. If both parties agree on the conditions, the ransom can be redeemed that night.</p>
<p>Low Price: These kidnappers ask for a relatively low price. The asking price is only two or three thousand yuan, but the result is that only five or six hundred yuan is needed to settle the matter. It can be said to be a great bargain.</p>
<p>Place of Payment: After the kidnappers and the villagers agree on the ransom, if the villagers cannot raise a large sum of money at once, they will pay a certain amount of money that night and agree on a date to pay the remaining money. It is said that the agreed place for paying the money is mostly in the desolate tombs and chaotic graves near the Fanhua Ferry and Xujiahui stations.</p>
<p>Nine Out of Ten Houses Empty: Under this kind of situation, wealthy families have long been mostly empty, moving to the city. Even those who have not moved are on tenterhooks at night, sleeping in the cowshed and pigsty to avoid the attention of bandits. Even children who are only a few months old are regarded as treasures by bandits and kidnapped away. The plight of farmers is really unspeakable.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Talking About Japanese Mahjong Clubs <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yisan Outer Historian</p>
<p>In recent years, mahjong has been extremely popular among Japanese people. Their enthusiasm is no less than that of the Americans. The Japanese authorities are afraid of creating gambling habits among the people, so they only allow it as a purely recreational game. However, those who gamble are certainly more numerous than those who do not. They often use chips as a front for winning or losing. When the game ends, money is always exchanged privately.</p>
<p>General speculators, catering to the psychology of the masses, are competing to establish mahjong clubs. These clubs vary in size and are spread all over the country. The names on the signs are very novel, such as "Pure One Suit", "Red Dragon", "East Wind", "Nine of Bamboo", etc. The interior decorations are extraordinarily luxurious, and there are women serving as receptionists. When the number of customers is insufficient, they can also join the game to make up the numbers. However, most of the people who go there are young men, whose intentions are not on the game itself. Moreover, the cost is not high, so the ability to attract customers is quite strong.</p>
<p>Some clubs, in order to promote mahjong education, hire Chinese people who are good at Japanese to serve as teachers (because mahjong was invented in China), specializing in teaching tactics for free.</p>
<p>A mahjong competition is held once a week. Participants must pay an entry fee of one Japanese yen per person. Then, they enter the game according to the assigned number. The first, second, and third place winners are all given valuable prizes. At the same time, the person with the worst score also receives a considerable prize. This is also a method used by the club to encourage customers who do not know how to play mahjong (no reward).</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Strange Pagoda of Wenzhou <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Junxia</p>
<p>Twenty li outside Yongjia County, there is a place called Baiyu. There is a pagoda by the river. It is about ten levels high. Its base is also very dilapidated. At a glance, one can tell that it is a building from the old century. What is strange is that the entire pagoda can automatically lean in all directions, and the direction is different every year. Therefore, the elders of the village all say that the direction the pagoda leans indicates that the people in that direction will have added happiness in that year. This kind of unfounded talk is certainly not worth discussing. However, how can a towering ancient pagoda move by itself? This is indeed strange.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>In Indian religions, those who practice asceticism do not wear any clothes. Wearing clothes is not for men. Above heaven and below earth, only naked people are respected. Coming and going naked, without any attachments, is still the case today. On the banks of the Ganges, sages emerge in large numbers, still meeting each other in hundreds. Among them are not all poor and foolish people. Doctors, young masters, princes, and wealthy people abandon fame, status, and learning, even loved ones, and practice asceticism diligently. They come to the banks of the Ganges and roar to the sky to end their years. When free, they teach the masses the wonders of the Tao. Su Shi said, "The sharp edge of the Zen is not to be touched, thousands of verses are like overturning water." Those who observe the etiquette of disciples and offer incense and flowers are everywhere. This is a technique used by ancient sages to liberate themselves and the world. That is why Alexander the Great was subdued by the sages of the Jews. Alas, we can only salute and retreat. How dare we criticize it? From my point of view, two-legged animals cannot be killed no matter how hard you try, and cannot be saved no matter how hard you try. This is called society. Today, those who can kill many people are called heroes. Those who can abandon the world are also men. Are they immortals or Buddhas? Are they heroes? They are all the same monsters in the world, and they still cannot solve the problems of society.</p>
<p>The buildings beside the Ganges are magnificent. A certain place was built by a certain king. A certain rich man donated to it. The rooms are like combs, facing the Ganges River. The scenery is excellent. For thousands of years, sages have emerged, far surpassing the false reputation of our Zou and Lu. If we were to travel to Zou and Lu today, how many famous people could we meet? Yet the great law of the sages of the Ganges is still flourishing. Mahatma Gandhi, the new Buddha, is also a disciple of Indian religions. Alas, India's influence is like this. How dare we criticize it? In recent years, Westerners who convert to Indian religions are gradually increasing. We left the land and boarded a boat. The small boat could hold ten people. The students rowed it, letting it go into the middle of the river. We saw a red cloth package placed on the riverbank. Beside it was ash. The student said, "This package is the corpse of a dead person, which will be burned and thrown into the river to ascend to heaven." In Indian religions, heaven is in the water, while the Muslim leader Muhammad said, "Heaven is under the feet of the mother." He was speaking for the present world, while Indian religions practice asceticism and Islam follows the world. Again, an object floated in the water. The student said, "This is a corpse." I asked in surprise. He said, "This is a novice monk. After his death, people sent his body to the river, also with the intention of ascending to heaven." I wanted to vomit greatly. The Indian custom of water burial is to respect water to such an extent.</p>
<p>The students asked me about Chinese weddings. I said, "Now it is quite free." The student told me that in Indian customs, one can get money for marrying a wife. I asked the reason. He said, "If a person has a daughter who is not married by the age of ten, her parents will be in great trouble. If she is married, she must compensate heavily with her family property." I found it strange and asked the reason. He said, "If a daughter is not married when she is older, she will inevitably find it difficult to guard her chastity. If there is an unexpected encounter, her parents will be punished with expulsion from the clan." Aul-caste is expelled from society. If a woman has a love affair, it is considered a disgrace to the family. Therefore, people will break off relations with her family. She cannot live in society. Therefore, they are anxious to arrange early marriages, or compensate the husband's family with their family property. Men are not in a hurry to marry early. Therefore, families with daughters are very worried. In Indian customs, one never divorces in one's life. Widows often commit suicide after their husbands die, considering it common. I find the Indian ideal strange. In everything, they create a fixed system of fate, nailing all living people to a fixed law within the system, and maintaining it to this day. The best remedy for this kind of system is Western free marriage and love to counteract it. How strange it is. The student said, "Now, influenced by the Western wind, it is gradually changing."</p>
<p>There was a student who did not believe in any gods. I said, "Look at the temples by the river, many have fallen. The gods cannot even protect their own temples. They must rely on people to protect the gods."</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>"Well, you keep watch! Mr. Lu, who came yesterday, will probably come again today!" Miss Ding said softly. Qiu Zi also smiled and agreed.</p>
<p>Before long, Mr. Lu indeed arrived. Qiu Zi saw him from a distance as she stood at the gate and immediately went inside to inform. When Mr. Lu walked into the reception room, Miss Ding was already smiling as she greeted him.</p>
<p>"I'm too late! I hope you don't mind," Mr. Lu's gentle tone and courteous manner strongly stimulated Miss Ding's fragile emotions.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting for a long time! I thought you might have had something else to do," said Miss Ding.</p>
<p>"Could anything be more important than coming here today, in all that I do? Before I came, I was so worried and timid...I just thought, maybe I would end up disappointing you. But now, I have boldly come, and boldly brought something with me. Will you despise me? Or will you pity me?" Mr. Lu had indeed put a lot of thought into these words, which were very tactful and natural, like the song of a begging little bird.</p>
<p>At the same time, a small diamond ring in his pocket appeared before Miss Ding's eyes. Miss Ding showed no other expression than a smile. She said, "What does this mean?"</p>
<p>"This is my contribution. I hope it can be exchanged for the most precious thing in the world, which is your love," said Mr. Lu, with every word trembling like a wave.</p>
<p>Miss Ding could not help but show shyness. But in her unspoken silence, it was clear that she had accepted Mr. Lu's request. Mr. Lu gently took her hand and gently stroked it. She seemed to want to avoid it, but seemed to let Mr. Lu do as he pleased.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Miss Ding's left middle finger was already wearing the diamond ring that Mr. Lu had brought. They looked at each other, their eyes seemingly flowing with water and burning with fire.</p>
<p>Qiu Zi waited outside the door. She clearly knew that there was a mysterious meaning in the reception room, but she did not dare to rush in rashly. She secretly peeked through the keyhole. She saw Mr. Lu and her young lady sitting side by side. She also saw Mr. Lu put a ring on her young lady's hand. She also saw Mr. Lu lower his head and kiss her young lady's hand… Her heart could not help but beat wildly.</p>
<p>Finally, she heard them calling her from the room. She walked in and saw that her young lady's face was covered with a blush of shyness, which she could not hide, even though she was being very reserved.</p>

<p>Slight Decline: Yesterday, the Gold Industry Exchange opened as usual. The gold standard declined slightly, and the situation was still stable, hovering around 40 taels. The overall market had a turnover of 5 taels, eventually falling by 2.1 taels. The silver market rose slightly in the morning, but market sentiment was weak, and the market opened low, soon breaking through 40 taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate loosened and then stabilized. On the surface, the buying side seemed to be active. By noon, the 40-tael mark was regained. There were slight advances and retreats, and the afternoon market was more peaceful, but the fluctuations were very small, and trading was scattered. There may be no glory or disgrace for the major firms this morning.</p>
<p>Morning Opens Low: The opening price for September this morning fell by 4.3 mace, to 737.5 taels. There were no changes in the major firms and silver prices from the 2nd. On the 3rd, London was closed, but the New York silver price rose by 1/8, with a private telegram adding 1/16. In addition, Citibank's stock was reported to be high, so the intention of the industry was further downward. Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Wupin, etc. all sold, eventually falling to 36.5 taels. Not long after, Dalian Bank and Cuichangyong, Yuancheng, etc. bought in, and Zhengjin initially absorbed 1,875 taels of October British gold. Later, Maihang and Zhejiang traded August 125. Therefore, the gold price rose slowly, a total increase of 4 mace, to 40.04 taels at 9:20 AM. The British gold price was announced unchanged. During the period, Wupin hedged and sold, falling to 39 taels. Afterwards, Yuanheng, Yuanchengyong, and Cuichangyong came in, and China Bank absorbed 125 of October British gold, and Mitsui absorbed 1.61 to 1.60875 taels of Japanese gold, so the price rose by about 2 mace again, reaching 39.9 mace at 9:30 AM. A moment later, Yuanmaoyong and others sold, and Taiwan bought 1.6075 taels of Japanese gold, and a forward price of 1.6125 taels appeared again, falling by 1 mace. At 10:30 AM, the price was 38.7 mace. The situation tended to stabilize afterwards. Cuichangyong, Yongfeng, Changshengyong, speculator Wu, etc. all bought in, so the price seemed to rise. Soon after, the Indian exchange rate fell by 2 annas, making it even more firm. At 11:30 AM, the price was 40.08 taels, but Shunli, Wanxing, and Yuanmaoyong sold out. At the close of the market, the price was 40 taels, and the quoted price was still 790.02 taels, a difference of about 50 taels.</p>
<p>Falls 2.1 Taels: The after-market opened at 40.05 taels, but Wupin had already opened at 0.05 taels, then rose from 0.07 taels to 0.02 taels. It was then heard that the Indian exchange rate was down by 1 anna, and Cuichangyong, Dadecheng, etc. bought in, jumping by more than 1 tael, reaching 41.5 taels at 2:20 PM. After that, HSBC sold 125 of British gold, and Zhifengyong, Fuchang, etc. sold out, immediately falling by 1 tael, reaching 40.02 taels after 2:30 PM, and 0.089 taels after 3:00 PM. Afterwards, there were very few transactions, and the exchange rate did not change. The British gold price of 125 could be settled. Yuanmaoyong, Tongfengheng, etc. sold out, immediately falling back to within 40 taels, reaching 39.2 taels after 4:00 PM, then rising by 6-7 mace, to 39.9 taels. At the close of the market at 4:30 PM, the price was 39.7 taels, a decrease of 2.1 taels compared to last Saturday (August 1).

<p>Market Overview: Recently, the financial community has been sluggish due to the consecutive bank closures. All receipts and payments have been mostly shelved. Therefore, when the banks opened yesterday, the procedures were quite busy. As for the money industry, although there were daily inflows and outflows, the bank closures were naturally slightly more than usual.

<p>Decline of Around Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market on the local stock exchange saw limited trading in spot bonds, with only the demobilization of soldiers bond showing some activity. The futures market remained buoyant. Trading volume in the morning was lively, reaching 15.6 million between the two sessions. In the afternoon, the market was calmer with less price volatility. Bond prices experienced a slight correction, and fluctuations were more moderate. With bond prices having already risen significantly, some market participants took profits by selling at the high. Additionally, certain parties continued to offload positions, resulting in a general decline at the opening. Long-term unified tax bonds had once fallen by more than one yuan, but the supply and demand dynamics normalized, and prices stabilized. Fluctuations in each session were minimal, with only customs bonds showing some firmness and most others falling by about 0.45 yuan. The price movements seemed to have reached a temporary pause. Total spot bond trading volume for the day was only 8,000 yuan, while futures trading reached 23.4 million yuan, with the unified tax bond being the most active and the 20-year customs bond also accounting for a significant portion.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Yarn Market Shows Slight Improvement <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firmer, and the trend is still stable. This is because the overseas cotton yarn situation is temporarily leaning towards the downstream, causing a lack of confidence. However, buyers see that foreign cotton has fallen for several days in a row, and anticipate a possible rebound. Furthermore, two yarn factories in Wuxi have stopped for repairs and reorganization, and there are rumors of a strike. As a result, the market sentiment has slightly improved. However, current yarn sales are unusually sluggish, and all businesses have been affected by floods, showing no signs of excitement. In addition, the floods in various provinces are becoming more severe, severely impacting autumn sales. Nevertheless, judging from the overall situation, it is difficult for prices to rise significantly.</p>
<p>Individual Investors Make Purchases: In the forward market of the Exchange, the opening situation was flat, but later individual investors made purchases, and prices for various months rose slightly by two, three, four, and five cents. The afternoon market sentiment was still stable, and prices for various months rose another four cents. The total transaction volume was 20,900 bales. According to reports, Xincheng sold 1,050 bales, Minghua 800 bales, Jifeng 500 bales, Mingde 550 bales, and Lichang 550 bales. Mingde bought 1,000 bales, Yiyu 1,200 bales, and Gengfeng 1,100 bales. The closing prices of the forward market are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Forward Market Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Account Balances: Closing Price, Gain/Loss, Account Balance</p>
<p>August 162.0, Up 7, 66,700 November 161.0, Up 9, 88,150</p>

<p>October 166.4, Up 8, 95,100 January 162.4, Up 8, 27,050</p>
<p>Spot Sales Turn Quiet: Spot yarn sales are weak. According to reports, all businesses bought a total of only 700 bales throughout the day. 50 bales were traded among peers. In terms of out-of-town businesses, about 230 bales came from the interior, 50 bales from Guangdong, 110 bales from Sichuan, 30 bales from Changsha, and 265 bales from Yunnan. One business bought 55 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Cotton Market Shows Slight Improvement <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The American cotton situation is still flat, but local sentiment is slightly firmer. This is because American cotton has fallen for eight consecutive days, and there is concern that it may rebound and rise. In addition, there is news that 1.3 million bales of American cotton have been loaned to Germany, and there is concern that this may become a reality. Individual investors are therefore competing to buy, and the market trend is becoming slightly tighter. However, judging from the overall situation, it is still normal. This is because the spot price of American cotton, calculated in silver, is only about 35.8 taels, so large players are unanimously selling. However, due to floods in various regions, cotton losses are not small. How the future will unfold depends on exchange rate fluctuations and the performance of American cotton.</p>
<p>Han Standard Cotton Rises by 3-4 Cents: In the forward market of the Exchange, the opening price of Han standard cotton rose by 2 cents to 1.5 cents because of a lack of sellers in the market. The afternoon market situation was again flat, with prices for various months rising by 0.5 cents to 1.5 cents. The total transaction volume was 66,800 dan. According to reports, Ruidai sold 4,100 dan, Xinheng 3,900 dan, Taixing 2,800 dan, and Dafu 1,900 dan. Jifeng bought 1,900 dan, Hengyi 2,200 dan, Shenji 1,900 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, and Deji 1,600 dan. The closing prices of Han standard cotton are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>American Cotton Bulls Liquidate: Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to purchases by speculators, but later weakened due to the liquidation of bulls and smooth cotton harvests. Futures prices rose or fell by 1-4 points, while spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton markets were closed. Indian cotton short covering made the market situation mediocre.

<p>New York, 3rd. The Fanjour Company's estimate of the current new cotton crop is 70.8% of the normal annual production, totaling 14,327,000 bales. The previous estimate (June 29th) was 69.5% of the normal annual production, totaling 12,180,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Rice Market in Hexia Falls Sharply Again <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>South Market: Yesterday, the sources from various businesses totaled about twenty, mostly from Pinghu and Nangang, with a small amount from Pudong. Retail sales in urban and rural areas were sluggish. The arrival of Dongxin japonica rice saw a surge in supply, and sentiment was flat, reducing the intention to buy. Businesses also felt more relaxed due to the fatigue in the North Market, and transactions were limited. Selling prices had to be lowered, with thick indica and thin japonica prices falling by two to three corners. There was not much of the top-grade yanglu pointed rice, and sales were also thin. However, as the amount of foreign rice increased again, the market was firm. Yin rice was uplifted by the Tongbian Company, and fresh high-quality rice continued to be sold, with market prices being strong. 170-180 shih of Pudong new japonica rice arrived yesterday. As for retail sales, they were extremely weak, and prices fell by another half a yuan. The reason for the high price of foreign rice is that supplies have been scarce for a long time, and there is little stock in warehouses. The actions of out-of-town businesses are not sufficient to meet demand, and the market situation has stabilized.</p>
<p>Xinzha: The rice market had more than thirty sources, but sales were in a slump. The new japonica rice market has been weakening daily, with ordinary goods down half a yuan. The situation still requires further declines. Early indica rice is arriving in abundance but sales are sluggish, falling back by three to four corners. Sales of thick japonica rice are becoming increasingly rare, and warehouse stocks are gradually increasing. Buying interest is muted. Top-grade Yanglu pointed rice is arriving continuously, with some inquiries for small lots. Production reports continue to soften. The above prices have all fallen by one to two corners, and the market situation is extremely weak. The price of top-grade rice at the port is slightly lower, so businesses still have a strong appetite. The situation is slightly soft, and a small amount of top-grade rice is sold by out-of-towners, with few transactions. However, the sources seem to be becoming scarcer, and the shortage of white yuan goods is increasing daily by two to three chi.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Flour Market Rises and Then Softens <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially showed a firm trend but then weakened. This is because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell slightly by one to two corners, and there are very large stocks of American wheat, with a tendency to dump them. Therefore, although the buying interest from inland businesses was very strong at the opening, mostly due to the floods, concentrating their strength, factories had foreign wheat contracted and gradually unloaded it, so the market rose and then softened. As a result, the price for August was 2.5 li better than the previous day, the price for September was 7.5 li better, and the prices for October to January were 2.5 li better, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Wheat Market Temporarily Presents a Stalemate <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed a hovering trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell again slightly by one to two corners. Although inland businesses were still firm in their intentions due to the continued floods, the shorts had foreign wheat available to deliver, so both sides had strength in the stalemate. As a result, transactions became quiet and the market saw little up or down movement. In the end, only the price for October was up slightly by two fen, the price for November was up slightly by one fen, and there were no changes for the rest. Because factory demand is still good, the price of spot wheat is trending stable. Over five thousand bags of wheat from Wusong, Shuangfeng, Taicang, Zhitang, Huangdu, Anting, Penglai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyan were purchased by Fuxin and Huafeng, it is said.</p>

<p>Only a total of 140 bales were transacted... Sales to British, French, and Silk Businesses</p>
<p>The Shanghai white factory products handled by foreign firms in this port and sales to America have been stagnant for several months. Britain and France also only had sporadic spot transactions. The appetite of inland silk businesses was even smaller. Transactions in July were scarce, with only 140 bales of spot silk transacted. Sales to Britain and France accounted for 80% of the total, with the remainder purchased by silk merchants from Zhejiang and Hangzhou, it is said.</p>

<p>The cable from European and American Hua silk yesterday still showed no signs of turning around. The European firms in the Shanghai port did not dare to take risks and proceed. Yesterday, only inland silk merchants purchased 5 bales of Shanghai white factory spot products and 5 bales of lower-grade dried silk, and prices were firm, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Green Tea Market Trend is Increasingly Firm <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market in this port, European firms continued to have a strong need for green tea such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei needles from Lailu. The price of core-drawn Zhenmei has been raised to 230 taels, and the market trend is increasingly firm. Shrimp eyes, Fengmei, etc., also have good sales, and the market price has been raised by four to five taels. Regarding Gongxi, the Russian Aid Society is said to continue reviewing it today and begin negotiating prices. According to the general intention of tea merchants, this year's harvest in the interior has been greatly reduced, and they are unwilling to compromise and sell the tea, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Piece Goods: Chinese Factory Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Local Factory Cloth: The recent trend has been very chaotic. The goods from Chinese factories have a tendency to soar to the sky due to the impact of the boycott of Japanese goods, especially fine cloth and fine twill, which are even more scarce and expensive. Compared to before the boycott, they must rise by six or seven cents. Yesterday, Balloon fine cloth sold for 7 taels and 9.5 mace, Ren Zhong for 7 taels and 8.5 mace, Jincheng fine twill for 8 taels and 1.5 mace, and Butterfly Ball for 7 taels and 7.5 mace. Furthermore, spot goods are extremely scarce. Since the smooth sales of Japanese factory goods before the boycott, spot goods have also been extremely scarce, so they have not fallen recently. After once rising, coarse cloth has gradually stabilized. 9-pound Five Blessings is 5 taels and 1.5 mace, 11-pound Ren Zhong is 5 taels and 7 mace, 13-pound Double Horse is 6 taels and 6.5 mace, and 16-pound Five Cranes is 8 taels and 2.5 mace, it is said.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods: Although Eastern goods have been under severe boycott for the past few days, sales are still smooth. The Yangtze River basin is even busier than usual. This is because although Shanghai has implemented inspections, the ports of Hankou, Shashi, Changsha, and Chongqing are still unimpeded, so the firms in Shanghai are entrusting Japanese customs brokers to pack and transport goods, so prices have not fallen. However, as of yesterday, the Hankou businesses have sent a telegram to stop packing and handling goods due to the floods. A large batch of goods was sent to Sichuan and Changsha yesterday, and a batch of transit goods has recently been handled for the businesses in Yunnan and Guizhou. The equivalent Western goods are very scarce in the market, so development is difficult to predict, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e215">North and South Goods: Quanzhou Pao Yuan (Dried Longan) Prices Rise <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Quanzhou pao yuan has been in short supply recently. The stock of the firms has already been baked, increasing costs. Now that the local stock is scarce and the new crop is still far away, businesses are quite interested in buying. Several hundred boxes of top-grade round longan have been transacted daily, with prices rising by two to three taels compared to before. However, the firms' stock is already scarce, so the market is expected to rise rather than fall, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Prices Fall Sharply <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams reported that Cuban spot sugar was unchanged, New York sugar futures for September fell two points, and other months also fell one point each. Javanese spot and futures sugar prices remain unchanged. The Public Association market plate price for Dutch sugar 24 coarse sand white sugar market sentiment was particularly weak, and selling was particularly strong. The transaction price was 11 taels and 3 mace, Hong Kong goods 11 taels 2 mace and 2.5 fen, and 20 medium sand white sugar 10 taels and 8.5 mace. Buying interest was also quiet, and the market was generally weak. The local Binghua Qing, graded at 10 taels and 3.5 mace, was snapped up in the market. Demand for Taikoo refined sugar was slightly stronger, and transactions gradually became active. B 11 taels 8 mace and 7.5 fen, new goods 11 taels and 9 mace, CW 11 taels and 7 mace, DX 11 taels 6 mace and 7.5 fen, HX 11 taels 5 mace 6.25 to 5.75 fen. Sales in the aftermarket were even fewer, and the market situation was very strong. The firm Yuxiang Factory sold a few hundred bags of Binghua Qing, with the price rising to 10 taels and 4 mace, and the market was not weak. Jinfahang sold several hundred bags of coarse sand white sugar, with the original price of 11 taels and 3 mace. Few buyers were interested, and the market saw a decline, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e238">General Discussion of the Feixia Car <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>--- Dumb</p>
<p>The current development situation of various automobile factories in Italy is rapidly advancing. Among them, the progress of the Feixia factory is particularly astonishing. If we recall ten years ago, the Feixia factory was not well-known at that time, and the performance of the cars produced was also very ordinary. However, in the recent ten years, there has been special progress. The cars produced over the years have all been well-received by society. Sales have increased year by year. Nowadays, almost every city center has Feixia cars. In short, Feixia cars are truly unique in the automobile market, especially among small cars, and have already established a significant position. Since the end of the European War, Feixia has launched the 501 model. Because of its excellent performance, it has been widely welcomed by society. Following the 501, there were also the 509, 514, and 521 models. The new cars launched each year have shown remarkable progress, which is why sales have been so prosperous.</p>
<p>Looking at the past history of Feixia cars, the beauty of the design and the spaciousness of the interior are probably the most obvious features of the various new models. Almost everyone knows this. Among them, the 514 model stands out with its unprecedented beautiful body. Although the wheelbase is no different from the nine-horsepower Feixia car, the interior space of the car is slightly wider. Even with four people sitting inside, it feels very comfortable, with no feeling of crowding. The aluminum radiator, tall and narrow, also enhances the vehicle's aesthetic appeal. The body's construction is particularly surprising. The four-door sedan has three lights on each side. The two-door coupe has two large windows. Other models, such as convertibles and two-seater sedans, all have very comfortable seats, and the exterior of the body is painted in a very elegant and beautiful manner. In short, the beautiful appearance and comfortable driving of Feixia cars are unmatched by any other car.</p>
<p>In addition, the main advantages of Feixia's latest cars lie in the exquisite engine and powerful electrical system. The electrical system, governed by the generator, battery, and coil, distributes current very conveniently and also has a relatively strong generating power. As for the engine construction, it is particularly unique. There are four main points in the way the chassis is connected, with spherical rubber devices in between to act as cushioning. The distribution method places two of these points near the meshing gear, which are the key connection points. The other two points are in the front and extend over the car frame. The simple meshing gear is fitted with an elliptical handle, which operates very smoothly and requires no attention. The gearbox is made of lead and has four acceleration settings. Moreover, the place where it connects with the meshing gear is also connected with screws, as are various other important parts. In addition, the small gears, covered with a mesh, ensure that there is no noise when the car is running. There are truly countless advantages.</p>
<p>Following the 514 model, Feixia soon launched a six-wheeled, six-cylinder bus. Its excellent performance was unprecedented. It was once displayed at the Italian branch of the Milan factory for public exhibition. In terms of Italy's current transportation industry, it is no different from other European countries. In bustling cities, buses are used for transportation instead of streetcars. This is especially true in Rome, the capital of Italy. Currently, in busy areas of Rome, only buses are allowed, and streetcars are prohibited. Other central areas, such as Milan, Florence, and Naples, have also adopted the same policy, although not as strictly as Rome. It can be seen that the sales of buses in Italy are undoubtedly considerable. The new Feixia large-wheel bus is the 604 model, manufactured in Italy. Since</p>
<h3 id="e239">Discussion of the Carriage Decoration of Sedan Automobiles <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiang</p>
<p>The increasing sophistication of modern life into artistry is an undeniable fact. All objects are valued for their beautiful decoration, to move people. Westerners often like to come up with unique ideas for their daily automobiles, adding some decoration as a point of pride. In particular, the interiors of sedan automobiles feature many novel and exquisite adornments, greatly enhancing the refined taste. Here, a few examples are specially selected for car owners in Shanghai to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>Fragrance Filling the Seats: The extravagance of French women's lives has long been known. Their fondness for perfume is particularly intense. Not only is their jade-like skin constantly fragrant, but their clothes and residences are also often sprinkled with perfume to attract the opposite sex. Not long ago, in Paris, whenever women drove by in their cars, a strong scent of perfume would spread through the air, intoxicating and captivating. This is because they also liberally sprinkle perfume in the car, resulting in the seats being filled with fragrance and the allure overflowing. As for women in the British Isles, they are inherently quiet and fond of nature, and do not like strong perfumes. Therefore, they often keep one or two fresh flowers in their cars. The delicate fragrance slowly wafts, with an elegance beyond compare, creating a completely different atmosphere from the French women in Paris.</p>
<p>A Dazzling Array of Portraits: Photographs and portraits, in modern life, are a form of decoration with considerable authority. The practice of hanging portraits inside automobile carriages originated in America. Now, it is commonly seen in continental Europe. These portraits are mostly very exquisite and delicate, occupying very little space inside the car, yet they are dazzling and extremely lovely. The people in the portraits generally have a very close relationship with the car owner, hence they cannot bear to be separated for even a moment. American young men and women, in particular, often hang pictures of their loved ones inside the car to dispel loneliness. Last autumn, in Chicago, a major tragedy unfortunately occurred as a result of this. An American girl named Carlson, while driving, constantly gazed at the photograph of her smiling lover hanging inside the car. She was momentarily negligent and injured a pedestrian, ultimately receiving a prison sentence of several months before being released.</p>
<p>Brocade Curtains and Cushions: The exquisite and ingenious silk embroidery of the Orient has long been treasured by Europeans and Americans. In recent years, the export of embroidery from our country to overseas markets, sold in Europe and America, has increased significantly each year. According to surveys, the largest buyers of this category of embroidery are the Americans, followed by various countries in continental Europe. Those used as curtains and cushions inside sedan automobiles account for as much as six or seven tenths. The popularity of this trend at the time can be imagined.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Recent Conditions of Guizhou Province's Roads <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Shanlang</p>
<p>The Construction Department of Guizhou Province, recognizing that the stagnation of customs, the poverty of the people, and the depletion of wealth are due to inconvenient transportation, has recently been actively working to develop the roads. Now, I explore and record news of various roads below.</p>
<p>(1) Sandu Road: Sandu Road starts from Duyun County, passes through the territories of Maha and Bazhai Counties, and ends at Sanhe, for a total length of over one hundred eighty li. Sanhe has a navigable river that leads directly to Liuzhou and Wuzhou in Guangxi, connecting with the main confluence of the Pearl River, which is also the main transportation route between Guizhou and Guangxi. Currently, the project is actively underway in four sections. I will describe the general situation below. (1) Duyun Section: The entire section is about seventy li long. The roadbed work has been fully connected. Although there are some places that need minor corrections, they are not very difficult. There are no major special projects. Therefore, not much funding is needed, and the work is convenient. It can be completed in a short period. The section from Pulin Street to Yagong Pass is already passable, and the rock excavation project at Yagong Pass has also been completed. (2) Maha</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Section: The entire section is about twenty li long. The roadbed work has not yet begun. The largest bridges, such as the one over Wengcheng River, require the construction of ten stone bridges. Yu Sihe River is about sixty zhang wide and is the largest project on this branch road. This section is the largest project and requires the most funding. Without guaranteed funding, it is difficult to determine a completion date. (3) Bazhai Section: The entire section is about thirty li long. Nearly six thousand five hundred laborers are currently engaged in surfacing with gravel, deepening side ditches, and tidying up roadside stones. The entire section is about seven tenths completed. However, the Taiyuan Bridge is damaged and still needs to be repaired, and the Taiyuan Slope also needs rock excavation. Once these two places are repaired, it can be passable. (4) Sanhe Section: The entire section is about fifty li long. The roadbed and surface are about eight tenths completed. What needs to be repaired now is the rock excavation at Yangyong Pass and the embankment construction at Daoma Kan. Once these two places are completed, it can also be passable.</p>
<p>(2) Luxia Road: Luxia Road is about sixty li long. It starts from Lujia Bridge in Maha County, passes through the territory of Lushan County, and connects to Xiasi. Xiasi also has a navigable river that flows through Hunan into Hankou, which is an important transportation route between Guizhou and Hunan. Here is a brief description of the construction progress. The section belonging to Maha County is about forty li long. The roadbed has been connected, and the surface is also being prepared. The project is simple and can be completed in a short period. The section belonging to Lushan County is only a little over ten li long, but the Huaqiao Bridge project is larger and requires more funding. Fortunately, the roadbed has been connected. Once the bridge work is completed, the entire road can be passable. As for the branch road section from Xiasi to Sifangjing, earth and stone work is currently underway in three groups. The first group is building a five-chi-high and seven-zhang-long road embankment on the left side of the Xiasi Market entrance, which has already been completed. The second group is excavating three cubic zhang of rocks at the Guanyinge entrance, of which one cubic zhang has been completed. The third group is digging the high slope on the right side of the Yandong Slope and filling the low-lying areas on the left side, which has been completed for ten zhang.</p>
<p>(3) Guiyang, Guiding Phoenix Mountain Area: In the Phoenix Mountain area of Guiding, there are currently over a hundred laborers working on the extremely steep slopes of the mountain and the nearby side ditches, and carrying stone materials and digging mud at the Tuidi Datong and Yakou areas. The laborers are quite enthusiastic. There are also over twenty stonemasons excavating over four hundred cubic chi of rocks. Both sides of Guanyintang have arched over one zhang. The Guiding Xima River Bridge has been completed for one span and the Shamujian span. The remaining three spans can be completed within one or two weeks. The Tangjiazai Bridge has been completed for one span, and the remaining two spans are half completed. The rocks at Guanyinge are excavated to an average length of ten zhang and a depth of three chi. From Guiding Wengcheng Bridge to Shimenkan, there were over nine hundred laborers and two hundred and fifty stonemasons this week. The laborers are digging at the Shimenkan entrance and the concave entrance of Phoenix Mountain and carrying mud and waste rocks. The stonemasons are excavating about one thousand cubic chi of rocks at the Datong Yakou. The Guanyin Bridge has been fully sharpened.</p>
<p>(4) Gui'an Road: Gui'an Road, the Guiyang section from Qige Majiaoyin to Shihuiyao, has many road rocks. Team Leader Zhang of the road engineering team has surveyed and disclosed the results as follows. (1) Above Qige Majiaoyin, side ditch rocks should be excavated, totaling eighty-four zhang in length, three chi in width, and two chi in depth. (2) The slope of Xin Street should be reduced, and road rocks and side ditches on both sides should be excavated, totaling twenty-four zhang in length, three zhang six chi in width (including side ditches on both sides of the road), and three chi in depth. (3) The slope of Mawang Temple should be excavated, totaling fourteen zhang in length, three zhang six chi in width, and six chi three cun in depth. (4) The side ditch below Mawang Temple should have rock excavation, totaling nine zhang in length and three chi in width. (5) The right side ditch of Baihua Mountain should have rock excavation, totaling four zhang five chi in length, three chi in width, and four chi in height. (6) The left side ditch of Baihua Mountain should have rock excavation, totaling nine zhang in length, three chi in width, and two chi in depth. (7) The slope of Shihuiyao should have rock excavation, totaling eighteen zhang in length, three chi six cun in width, and five chi in depth. (8) The left side ditch of Shihuiyao should have rock excavation, totaling eighteen zhang in length, three chi in width, and two chi in depth. The road is currently undergoing active work. The section below Qige Majiaoyin, about thirty zhang, has been fully completed. The road surface completed in the Gan Tian area of Erpu is about four hundred and eighty zhang. The section from Shihuiyao to Huiyuan Bridge has been paved with eighty zhang of gravel. Seventy zhang have been paved at the two places of Paifangbian and Guansheng Temple. Eighty zhang have been paved at the two places of Guigui Tuo and Yeyatang. Ninety zhang have been paved from Yangliushu to Chayuan. The completed area from Datie Street to Sanpu is about seventy zhang. The completed area from Shatian to Shiguan is about two hundred and fifty zhang. The rock excavation for the newly built stone scholar at Haozhitang is about one hundred and fifty zhang. (5) Guinan Road: Zhou Bingji, the Guinan Road project director, recently submitted a letter to the construction department's road office, stating that except for a few special projects in the Machangping to Huoshan area, work is being actively expedited. The road should be passable in early May. In addition to the previous report, the road conditions from Machangping to Guiyang are described below for review. First, within the territory of Pingyue, the Xiahe Bridge has arched six sets of rocks. Due to the handover of the old and new county magistrates, the laborers suddenly dispersed, causing a slight pause. Now, the newly appointed Mr. Chen has strictly ordered the matter to be handled. Both civil and stone work are progressing simultaneously and can be completed in early May. One span of Sanwan Bridge has been sealed. The other span is only four sets of rocks away from being sharpened and can be completed by the end of this month. As for the road surface and other obstacles, they have long been cleared and repaired separately. However, there are still quite a few places with excessively steep slopes and major projects. Due to environmental and economic reasons, it is currently impossible to thoroughly clear and repair them. If only seeking to make the road passable, it can be done in early May. Second, within the territory of Guiding, the Mouqiudong Bridge was completed long ago. The five-span bridge outside the West Gate is currently under construction. Upon returning to Guiding, the responsible authorities have ordered the district to ensure that the wooden frame is complete and that the stones are transported. As for the stonemasons, in addition to strictly ordering the Lan stonemason leader to actively proceed, they have also ordered two other stonemason leaders, Luo and He, who are working on other bridges, to separate out two spans. With the increase in stonemasons, the laborers can seriously assist, so the road can also be passable in early May. The first two or three bridges have long been completed. In summary, the Guiding project, except for the slight obstacle of the five-span bridge, the remaining routes can be forcibly passable. However, due to environmental and economic reasons, the slopes are too steep, and the projects are too large, such as the Gu Meng Pass, Guanyin Pavilion, Shimenkan, and Zaojiao Ya areas, which are really beyond what can be thoroughly done at present. Third, within the territory of Longli, the bridges have long been completed. The road rock project is also over half completed. It is no longer a question that it will be passable soon. Fourth, within the territory of Guiyang, please supervise it nearby, and it can be passable in early May. I will return to Pingyue today to urge the project to proceed.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Tiger <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Qing</p>
<p>In countries below the equator, everywhere is dense forest, and even in villages, towns or plains, the deep green shadows closely obscure everything. If you climb up the mountains and hills, you can hardly see the sun.</p>
<p>The industrial town of Sushima is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces the sea on one side. There are many tigers and monkeys on the mountains. When the sky is overcast, their mournful cries and long howls in the mountains are very poignant, but the scholars or overseas Chinese who hear these sounds do not take them seriously, just like shepherds hearing the bleating of mountain goats. When I first arrived there, I found these sounds very strange and frightening. I used to love to wander by the coconut trees, and I also liked to sit under the wisteria flowers. As a result, I was a little afraid to go out.</p>
<p>The school is located on the mountainside, surrounded by old trees that are hundreds of years old. The mountain road newly built by the Dutch government not only makes it convenient for pedestrians and vehicles to travel, but also provides many conveniences for tigers. Every night, when it is quiet, they run from the mountains to the road to take a walk, look at the electric lights hanging on both sides, and listen to the scholars' music. They don't cry or make noise, as if they are afraid of waking people's sweet dreams. One day at dusk, the tigers and monkeys cried particularly sadly, so I asked a newly acquainted friend,</p>
<p>"Miss Zhang, the tigers and monkeys are crying particularly fiercely today. I don't know what the reason is."</p>
<p>"Because they feel too lonely living in the deep mountains for a long time, and they want to come down and see the electric lights, but they don't have money."</p>
<p>"If I were the general manager of a movie theater, maybe I would invite them into the theater."</p>
<p>"Miss Liu is really generous."</p>
<p>I asked her a serious question, which led her to make a joke with me. Indeed, I am really afraid of tigers. A few months ago, in a zoo in Java, I saw three tigers the size of small yellow cattle, confined in a large iron cage. When they saw the tourists, they turned their backs viciously like mules. Each of the patterned hairs stood on their backs like small trees. They also opened their blood basins like mouths, revealing silver teeth half a foot long, and made violent shouts at us. They also raised their two front paws high and placed them on the thick iron bars, while leaning their big heads against the gaps in the iron bars, drilling outwards in a frenzy. If they could run out, I am afraid that each tiger would not be full even after eating ten people. Because that time the tigers gave me a very deep impression, I am particularly afraid of tigers.</p>
<p>After some time, my friend Huiqing came. I told her about the news of many tigers in the mountains, and she couldn't help but feel afraid, almost not daring to go out the door. Our dormitory is isolated, a small, low house, deeply buried under the coconut trees. Because the weather is very hot, I only close the windows and doors at nine o'clock every night. Huiqing is afraid that tigers will run into the room to forage for food, so whenever the setting sun falls behind the volcano and the shadows chase away the dusk, she closes the windows and doors tightly.</p>
<p>There is no air circulation in the house, and it is extremely hot. With a fan in my hand, I can't do anything. Therefore, I feel very annoyed in my heart. I said bluntly,</p>
<p>"Before you came, I lived here alone, and the tigers didn't eat me. Do you want to be the queen?"</p>
<p>"A skinny bone like you, the tigers are afraid of breaking their teeth."</p>
<p>"You don't seem to be very fat. Look in the mirror and you will know that tigers must love to eat your meat. Unless they notify you in advance, like the school's maid, who weighs one hundred and sixty-two pounds, she still runs back and forth on the road at night, and she hasn't run into the tiger's mouth yet."</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense to me. I am really annoyed. I originally decided to return home via Bataan, but you sent letter after letter, urging my soul, and urging me to this tiger's den, suffering all the horror. I want to go back, I will leave tomorrow, lest I be buried in the belly of a tiger."</p>
<p>"Okay, don't make a fuss. If the tigers hear it, they will run over to find food for supper. It's already eleven o'clock, and our bodies and minds seem to be very tired. We have to get up at seven o'clock tomorrow to go to class. Let's go to sleep."</p>
<p>I said a few words, and she seemed to be very considerate of my fatigue. She didn't say a word, silently paced around the house a few times, and then fell asleep on the bed.</p>
<p>At school, there are six full hours of homework every day, starting at seven o'clock in the morning and continuing until one o'clock in the afternoon. Only on Saturdays are there only five hours. In the last hour, the student union holds a speech competition. Usually, I can rest for an hour, but on the Saturday of the twelfth week, it was my turn to judge. After the students finished their speeches, I also pretended to be a teacher and climbed onto the stage to criticize their language, tone, meaning, and attitude. There were more than two hundred students in the whole hall, all gathered attentively in a large auditorium. Unexpectedly, on the left side of the school's playground, a tiger came from somewhere, with its tail between its legs, sitting under a big elephant tree, its head facing the glass window, as if someone had invited it to listen to the speech. This was seen by a male student who went out to urinate. When he ran in, jumping and shouting, the air in the hall was almost completely destroyed. When everyone ran out to see, the tiger's body had already received three bullets from the bayonet of a Dutchman. It stretched out its four legs and fell under the tree, breathing its last breath.</p>
<p>Although there are many tigers in this mountain, I have never seen such a strange thing. After this incident, it also caused people in the whole village to discuss it. Some said it was a divine tiger, and some said it was a ghost tiger. These are all unfounded judgments. Some people say that tigers are afraid of earthquakes, because there was an earthquake a week ago, so the tiger was a little scared and ran down the mountain to escape, unfortunately escaping to the bayonet of a Dutchman.</p>
<p>At that time, Huiqing became even more frightened. Not only did she have to close the doors tightly at night, but she also dared not go out the door during the day. When she saw the mass of fresh blood flowing from the tiger's wound on the lawn under the elephant tree, she couldn't help but feel terrified.</p>
<p>When the weather is hot and irritable, you have to eat more ice water and fruits. Every time I want to go down the mountain to buy fruits, she always forbids me to go. Sometimes when I insisted on going down the mountain, she always cursed like this,</p>
<p>"If you are not buried under the volcano, you will be buried in the tiger's mouth. I don't care, go ahead."</p>
<p>"No, don't worry too much."</p>
<p>"This doesn't seem to have anything to do with me, but if you don't return home with me during the summer vacation, then I should also write a letter to your mother, telling her in detail about the news of your illness here and the current environment, because when we came out, your mother treated me like your older sister, entrusting me to take care of you, because you are too childish."</p>
<p>"Please don't let her know about these things. I will go with you during the summer vacation."</p>
<p>"Well, that's good."</p>
<p>At that time, I promised to return home with her, and she immediately opened her eyebrows and a smile hung on her lips. If I hadn't been ill and had travel expenses before, I might have returned home long ago, because there, in addition to the two dangers of tigers and volcanoes, there are many intangible oppressions, like the oppression that a timid nation should endure. From that day on, I had firmly decided that in two months, I would no longer want to hear the mournful sounds of tigers roaring and monkeys crying in the deep mountains.</p>

<p>The Chinese Cotton Textile Factory announced that the raw materials for raising hair, such as thistle fruits, used by the factory have been imported from Japan. The profits and rights have been flowing overseas, and the numbers are actually quite large. Ten years ago, Zhao Yuchun, a giant cotton textile merchant from Ningbo, went to Japan to investigate the industry. He specially purchased seeds and returned to China, vigorously urging farmers to cultivate the seeds. Over the years, the results have been excellent, and the thistle fruits are even more durable than Japanese goods. The price is also very cheap, and it has been repeatedly praised by Chinese cotton textile factories. Now, in order to promote domestic products, 100,000 units have been loaded and sent to Shanghai to meet the needs of cotton textile factories. If you want to purchase, contact No. 43, Chungeng Lane, Xiqipan Street, this city.</p>
<p>The Dahua Industrial Society announced that the society was jointly founded and operated by several graduates of Shanghai University and has been around for several years. It specializes in the manufacture and sale of chemical crafts. The society, in view of the fact that there is a lack of high-quality inks among domestic products, so that patriots have no way to buy them, and the profits and rights flow overseas, does not know how many. The laboratory has, with several years of experience, produced several kinds of high-quality red and blue inks, specially for fountain pens and for writing by the upper class. The acidity, fluidity, drying rate, and color have all been studied for a long time, and they can resist high-quality imported products. A descaling powder is also produced, which removes dirt and scale and is economical and convenient. It is a daily necessity for families. Now, in order to expand the business, managers from other cities are specially recruited. The general distribution office in this city is at No. 988, Sande Lane, Kang Nao Tuo Road.</p>
<p>Huachang Car Dealership at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hubei Road announced that since the dealership has been building painted car packages, it has been well received by passengers because the paint color is firm and bright and is no different from the paint color of automobiles. It will never change when heated or exposed to moisture. Now, in order to facilitate buyers and develop business, if customers in this city want to see samples but do not have time to come in person, they can notify us by phone or letter, and the dealership will send someone to deliver them specially. Whether or not to purchase is not considered.</p>

<p>The Aihua Pharmaceutical Society on Wangping Street announced that the company's national product, Changcheng Brand Minda, has a peaceful medicinal nature and wonderful effects. It is an essential sanitary product for summer. And the pills are large and the price is relatively low, so for several years, sales have been quite developed. Recently, due to the Ten Thousand Cases negotiations, everyone in the country is enthusiastically resisting Japanese goods, so Minda sales have become more and more rapid. Even Japanese colleagues in other cities and foreign grocery stores and cigarette paper stores are very enthusiastic to wholesale.</p>
<p>The Maochang Optical Company, located at the west end of the old North Gate, Jiucang Street, Minquan Road, announced that recently, due to the summer season and the scorching sun, in order to protect the eyesight of people from all walks of life, special real tea crystal glasses are sold. These tea crystal glasses are made of the highest quality tea crystal stone and are very valuable. They are cooling and clear, and there is no better choice. The quality is excellent, and the price is low, so those who come to the company to buy tea crystal glasses these days are very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy announced that the only way to keep fit is to temper the spirit and nourish the blood. If the blood is sufficient, the spirit and physical strength will be strong. Therefore, all men, women, old and young, who are weak and sick, should take artificial homemade blood to nourish it. Hygiene is the most important thing, and you should often wash with solid soap, so that the body and mind of compatriots will become stronger day by day. At this time of national crisis, I hope that compatriots will work hard and cooperate, promote domestic products, and restore rights. The pharmacy makes its own tonics, medicines, epidemic prevention, good medicines, sanitary products, various fragrant soaps, and cosmetics. The prices are cheap and the goods are beautiful. I hope compatriots will pay attention.</p>

His eldest son, Fumin, has a family history and has been practicing medicine for a long time. It is scheduled to officially open on August 1. The consultation fee does not count the amount, which is especially rare. It is truly the gospel of the sick.</p>
<p>Sun Huiqun Medical Clinic announced that Dr. Sun has extensive experience and is respected by the medical community. He previously established Chunlin Hospital in Baxianqiao, French Concession. Now, he has newly established Huiqun Hospital at No. 170 Xizang Road, where he serves as the president. The hospital is very well-equipped internally, and hospitalized patients are very well treated. The ward is well ventilated, and all kinds of diseases can be cured within a limited time. It is scheduled to open on August 1.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese General Assembly, all parts of the country have responded enthusiastically. The anti-Japanese movement of the people has now demonstrated a national spirit of unity, suggesting a determination to not coexist with the Japanese under the same sky. The recently published third issue of "People's Livelihood Weekly" contains an article entitled "On Sino-Japanese Negotiations and Sino-Japanese War," which analyzes the situation of Japan in various aspects. It believes that even if Japan has a submarine fleet, it will definitely not dare to declare war on China. It distinguishes and cites the situation of the Japanese military, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Russo-Japanese War, urging compatriots to strive together and not fear Japanese military strength.</p>
