<p>於外交。則更時時以革命外交自勵。民衆喁喁。於革命外交之實現。尤不勝其仰望期禱之殷切。色而比年來外交之成績。則實有未能達到當局平時所宣示於民衆者。故微辭之投。容當有故。此吾人在今日所　以至誠希望當局一自深思者也。辦理外交。重在有準備。重在有政策。其理　已略論於昨評。今日我國之在列國。例亦有公使與領事之設。此公使與領事。謂爲我國家駐在各國負責辦理交涉之負責人也可。爲我國家之耳民亦無不可。蓋駐在各國之公使與領事。其責任不專。在辦理臨時之外交。而尤在於平日觀察駐在國家之國情。國力。及其外交政策等。按時報告自國。以　參考。政府據此報告。然後斟酌己力。以定應付之方針。故外交部之於駐在各國之公使與領事。實如臂之於指。耳目之於肢體。應時時可以收靈活運用之效。今日我國外交官吏對於各國之情勢。果能胸有成竹乎。駐在各國之公使與領事。果能按時有觀察之報告乎。吾輩局外人。固不敢遂斷定其無有。然而關於國際情况。各國國情。我民衆從未聞外交機關作一次有序統之報告。又從未見有專書論及。豈眞外交秘密。不得不諱莫如深耶對蘇聯之中東路交涉。平時未審蘇聯之有無交涉誠意。輒派遣專員。深往彼國。歷時多日。交涉竟爾中斷。旣不能進。復不能退。此卽事先未審彼情勢無充分準備之例。又如蘇聯之矻立遠東。世界側目。姑無論彼國之前途如何。然而其爲一極應注意之國度。則至顯然。我國對彼。雖未復交。但對彼注意則絶不容忽然。而蘇聯之國情如何。我視之殆如一謎。自前次莫德惠氏自蘇聯返國報告。國内對彼空氣。乃頓爲轉變。最近蔣作竇氏自德繞道蘇聯返國。怱怱旅途之觀察。報告國人。我國内遂又爲一哄動。然而蘇聯之爲蘇聯。固猶是也。特我國從未之知耳。是亦外交官吏未能瞭然於列國情勢之又一例。惟其不知人。不審已。無準備。故交涉之形勢。我爲迎。爲承受。爲被動。人則爲施。爲進取。爲主動。卽使發動由我。亦常爲人欺騙。爲人牢籠。而無可如何。證之此種事實。則吾人如謂外交官。吏不能瞭然於國際之情勢。各國之國情。未必遂非事實。次之。一國之外交政策。卽爲一國適應環境以求生存之策略。此種策略。不外二端。一爲進取。一爲自衞。進取之政策。惟强有力者乃持之。我國限於國力。又基於求各殖民地各弱小民族一律平等之原則上。自絶不持前者對外侵略。而爲持後者求保全主權。抗禦凌侮。以對已</p>
<p>自衞。今日當局所昭示全國之廢除不平等條約。亦僅能謂爲自衞政策之一端然而除此以外。吾人絶未見有外交政策之宣示。僅見王外長在就職時。曾有外交在於「不讓步。」及不久。前曾有「以直綫外交擊破曲綫外交」之演辭。然而此皆手段。而非政策也。惟其無政策之確定。故對外交涉。每每不能發動由我。事發則以懸案了之。或更求助於人。終於未克達到自衞之目的。故今日外交上之所應。努力者。一爲預先之準備。一爲確定之政策。旣不能自主。復不能自動。革命外交之口號。終至莫克實現。民衆之失望與責備。豈偶然哉。</p>

<h3>韓民移殖東北之研究（彬）</h3>
<p>（一）前言</p>
<p>近自萬寳山案發生以後。著者曾爲文申論此事。以忠告日人。并以勗勉我同胞。惟是時至今日。韓民之移殖東北。數逾百萬。其在我國政治上經濟上。已成爲一極嚴重之問題。今年全國内政會議。對此問題。雖經一度討論。然其决議結果。多未見諸實行。韓人之混居雜處也如故。自由移殖也如故。而糾紛之發生。更方興未艾。以一種有目的之隂謀爲其策動之力。益以一部分之韓民爲其爪牙。於是歷年來我東北各地。乃糾紛百出。主權之侵犯。與種種無理之欺凌。常在一種有計劃有步驟之行動下發生。而與我國家以重大之迫害。我政府對此問題。明知其極爲重要。然而諱疾忌醫。積久無適當之對策。無積極之處置。旣無法以限制韓民之移入。又無法以監督其行動。坐使隂謀家之先遣步隊。源源而來。入我腹地。萬案發生。夫豈偶然。來日方長。如此問題。不得適當之解决。未來歲月。將再有若何嚴重事態發生。吾人更不難預揣。萬案發生後。日政府曾有與我交涉解决移民問題之表示。其用心所在。無非欲肆其詭詐之外交手段。取得移殖韓民於我東北之正式根據。事態之嚴重與緊迫。我國當無法再推諉擱置。充分之準備與籌劃適當之對策。此時正爲緊要關頭。否則前途隱患。將更不堪設想。著者瞻顧前途。杞憂良深。故不揣譾陋。用特陳述事實。并抒管見。藉以爲我國人告急。且深期我國人一共起商榷爲。</p>

<p>當日俄戰爭告終。日本外務大臣小村壽太郎。曾有二十年内向「蒙滿」移民四百萬之計劃。以後寺内内閣時代。外務大臣後藤新平。亦嘗有於十年内移民五十萬於滿蒙之豪語。但以（一）我東北之氣候與生活、不適宜於日人居住。（二）日本内地農民生活程度。較我東北農民爲高。（三）日本農民之刻苦耐勞。不及我東北農民。（四）我國内地對東北移民之猛進。有此四端。在事實上。日本農民遠不能與東北農民競爭。故日本政治經濟勢力直接伸入我東北歷數十年。雖其處心積慮。日以移民我東北是圖。直至今日。日人之在東北者。爲數僅二十餘萬。就中尤以滿鐵職員及機關公司等處人員佔絶對多數。其正式從事於農田水産事業者不過三四千人耳日民之移殖「滿蒙」政策。事實上雖已歸失敗。然决不肯因此遂放棄其原有計劃。於是「間接移民政策」乃代之而興。所謂間接移民者。卽以日人移居韓國。而逐韓人進入我東北。良以韓人生活程度。旣與華人相若。其於經營農事之刻苦耐勞精神。亦復相似。故利用韓人爲侵略我東北之先鋒。而日人則獨覇朝鮮。坐享其成。同時。日人統治韓國。雖備極鎭壓之能事。然而雞林八道。猶時呈不穩現象。復國之聲。再接再厲。間接移民之政策實現。則韓民之團結將因以渙散。復國之運動。亦將因以更加艱難。統治韓人自更易爲力。此韓民移殖東北之重要背景也。觀田中内閣「對滿蒙積極政策」奏章中之「朝鮮移民奬勵及保護政策。」更足以燭見其隂謀之毒辣。茲摘錄如次。</p>
<p>「朝鮮自與我合併以來。雖可一時小康。無如歐戰後。美大總統提倡民族自决。如天來之啓示。以煽動弱小民族。而朝鮮民心亦爲所煽。其不穩空氣。充滿雞林八道……幸滿蒙到處皆有豐富利源。以安朝鮮移民。因之日移日衆。至今日在東三省之朝鮮人。幾及百萬有奇。如此之現象。爲帝國對滿蒙之利權不求而可自得。眞可謂國家造成莫大幸福。而帝國對滿蒙之國防上經濟上。添加無數勢力。爲鮮民统治上。顯出莫大曙光。朝鮮移住東三省之衆。可爲母國民而開拓滿蒙處女地。以便母國民進取。且亦可藉朝鮮民爲階段。與支那民連絡一切。一面利用有歸化支那國藉之鮮民。盛爲收買滿蒙水田地。而另由各地之信用合作。或銀行等……通融彼等有支那籍之朝鮮民以資金。而作我經濟侵入之司令塔也。亦可作我食料之增産以救國危。是亦新殖民地開拓之一機會。其歸化之朝鮮人。名雖爲支那之歸化民。不久仍然歸復爲我國民。……</p>
<p>乃只因一時之便宜而歸化爲支那民耳。按在滿蒙之朝鮮人如擴張至二百五十萬人以上者。待有事之秋。則以朝鮮人爲原子而作軍事活動。更藉取締爲名。而援助其行動。加之鮮民中之在滿蒙有歸化爲支那民者。而亦有未歸化者。迨事到之日。是支那籍之朝鮮民作亂。抑或日本籍之朝鮮民作亂。可以懸羊頭賣狗肉之方策應付之。然我國雖可利用朝鮮人如此之行動。亦不可不備支那政府之利用朝鮮人制我也。………………加之我國如欲開拓新大陸。對朝鮮之保護及取締。更須嚴重一層。故依三矢之條約。許我遍設警察署於北滿各地者。更大爲擴張。充滿警察力。以便懷柔朝鮮民。及援助鮮民之急進。……我雖放棄石井。蘭辛協地之特權。亦可藉朝鮮民移住之新問題。而恢復其特權於滿蒙。如此之實情。我再恢復其特權。依法理上在國際必無人敢反對我國之行動也。」</p>
<p>又藤岡啓在其所著東省刮目論中。亦嘗論及此項問題。其言曰。</p>
<p>「……日本之滿蒙移民。經二十餘年之歲月。爲數不過十八萬。已可决爲絶望。其中惟一之國策。爲經濟戰上可與華人爲伍。而於開拓水田。有特殊技能之鮮人。送往滿蒙。間接指導滿蒙之開發。而解决日本之人口食糧問題。日本人之大陸發展。此外更無他策。直率言之。鮮人不過招牌而已。以故本問题解决。其成敗關於日本之存亡。若不能臻上乘。則滿蒙發展。直爲愚鈍。而統治朝鮮實力。亦爲世界所疑。本問題之解决。旣若此重大而微妙。而解决策自須迅速而爲根本的。然其根本解决策。果如何而可乎。」</p>
<p>「於本問題之解决。日政府在斷然决心之下圖年來懸案之商租權解决、使保證土地商租及居住營業之自由。……」</p>
<p>吾人考察田中奏章及滕岡啓論旨。可知日本之移殖韓民於東北。顯然不僅爲簡單之移民就食。其隂謀與野心。實在於圖謀其大陸政策之推進。而其手段之毒辣。運用之微妙。則更令吾人不寒而慄。數十年來。我邊疆日在其隂謀襲擊之下。恬然而不自覺。終以造成今日心腹之隱患。追溯往事。曷勝悲痛。此則我政府今日所應引爲殷鑑者也。（未完）</p>

<h3>西伯利亞旅行之險惡（上）</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>留德研究無線電學之曹仲淵氏。此次由德赴日。取道西伯利亞。過滿洲里抵滬。現正候船東渡。繼續考察與研究。昨語記者以西伯利亞途次險惡情形。可知蘇俄經濟恐慌國内紊亂之一斑。爰爲分類摘記如下。</p>
<p>▲盧布奇昂　俄國經濟狀况。因國際地位低微關係。盧布市價慘跌。在柏林每一馬克。可兌十五盧布以上。每一美金。可換五十餘盧布。滿洲里每華幣一元。亦可換十二盧布。旅客一入俄境。關吏搜查極嚴。不准夾帶外幣。並須在車站附設之兌換所兌換俄幣。但旅客隨身携帶用欵。大都係英鎊或美金。在俄每美金僅兌盧布一·九四·出境時若將餘剩盧布轉換美金·則盧布二枚·折算美金一元·其匯兌之紊亂如是是。</p>
<p>▲票價激增　西伯利亞鐵道國際利車之票價。去年八十一兩月蘇俄擅增二分之一。今年三月增百分之二十五。六月起又加百分之二十五。未及一年。而增至十倍。惟中國·德國·波蘭·各段票價照舊。現已引起各方抗議。辦理交涉。俄竟無切實答復。又凡中國旅客護照簽字以前。須另付電報費每名二十五馬克。亦屬奇事。</p>
<p>▲限制用費　旅客不論坐硬艙與軟艙。（卽三等與頭二等車之别）均可預購飯票。値美金二十三元一角。祇在俄境應用七天。並照蘇俄新訂章程。在此七日之中。每人每日限定至少用去俄幣七盧布又半。或美金三元八角七分。七日共須用美金二十七元餘。除買飯票外。如未用足此數。於出境時經關吏檢查核算。如數扣去。與曹君同行之留學生數人。用餘現欵。均被赤俄關員没收。並無理由宣布。旅客缺乏資斧。彼等不稍顧卹也。</p>
<p>▲車中設備　三等車須另租床位。薄墊爲褥。棹布爲毯。每三宿取美金一元半。顚擺甚苦。夏季灰沙飛揚。開窗則空氣污濁。關窗則窒悶燥熱。無浴室。盥洗祇有沸水。色焦黄。半雜沙土。係由火車頭直接放出。無醫生。車長及侍役。無不面貌獰惡。衣履不齊。且無一人能說英德法語者。交談殊感不便也。</p>
<h3>記江隂花園飯店所見</h3>
<p>— 羽白</p>
<p>舊歲道出江隂。寄寓南門劉伶巷内之花園飯店。花園之稱。惟此間能名副其實、是地爲一大好園林。號曰怡園。爲前淸太史公祝翁所營之莬裘。闢室一部爲飯店。意不在牟利。蓋聊與世人結緣耳。園林佈置。亦風雅亦整潔。令人流連。不忍遽去。有懸於廳事之聯一。典麗工整。茲錄之以公同好。「亂世莫多愁。儘他爲虺爲蛇。只管游祝氏怡園。隨遇而安。與爾同銷萬古·」一浮生宜縱酒。勿問屠龍狗。且走進劉伶　舊巷。閒來無事。勸君更盡一杯。」園中有能言之鸚哥一。善呼「黄包車」。淸脆可聽。又有綠毛龜一。供盆中。遠望嚴如茸茸綠草。蒼翠欲滴。至今不知尚存否。</p>
<h3>麞乳</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>麞似鹿而小。無角。毛作褐钩。其乳極補。爲牛羊乳所不及。浙西杭餘武安等處。頗多以之爲補品者。顧取乳之法。非若牛羊擠之於乳頭。乃取之於小麞之胃中者。故欲求麞乳。必須先捕小麞。茲將捕捉小麞。及取乳之舉。誌之如下。</p>
<p>麞之棲止。秋冬則在山林。春夏則在陂澤。每當小滿之候。爲其産子之期。每胎輙三四頭。常産於山麓淺草間。或平陂草蕩（無水）内。一般捕捉小麞冀得麞乳者。恒於小滿後。約伴持棒。往山陂間撥草搜尋。如有所獲。立卽斃之。並將其胃挖出。或當卽售之於人。或携歸取出其乳。置於布中。壓之使乾。裹以笋籜。置身畔俾服人氣。然後陸續出售。其値昂貴。每兩須銀二十元左右。</p>
<p>捕得小獐。所以卽殺之者。因其被捕後。輙將胃中乳汗吐出。或連聲哀鳴。鳴則其乳卽隨聲消化。此殆與香麝被捕後。卽舉爪自裂其香囊。同一例也。</p>
<p>捕捉小獐。殊非易易。蓋老猶與小獐。均極乖巧。凡小獐産出後。老獐當將各小獐四處分藏。其分藏之位置。或成正方形。或成品字形。且每日必將各獐搬移一次。而各獐之相距。愈搬愈遠。初生時。各獐分藏之所。相距僅數武。嗣後逐日遠離。以至於里許。而老獐之所以出此者。一則哺乳便於記憶。蓋老獐哺乳。日僅一子。循環輪流。周而復始。一則敵來侵害。不致一網打盡。至於小獐。亦甚狡獪。蓋終日藏身草中。人至其前。不稍動彈。雖被踐至死、亦不作聲。必俟捕者伸手促之。始跳躍竄遁。有時身浸水中。微露口鼻於水面。上覆水藻。以避人目。故捕者往往交臂失之也。</p>
<p>小獐一飲夏至水。其足卽有勁。遇敵則能遠逃。故斯時不易捕獲。其實小獐一至夏至。已能略食嫩草。故其足較有勁也。</p>
<p>獲得小獐。固屬幸事。顧其中猶有幸與不幸。蓋所獲者。有空肚飽肚之分。空肚者。已二三日不哺乳矣。胃中之乳。消化殆盡。飽肚者。甫於昨夜哺乳。胃中滿貯乳汁。乳最多者。壓乾後可得二三兩。値銀約三四十元。獲之者。誠幸運也。</p>
<p>獐乳以武康境内所産者爲最佳。識者能辨之。該邑設有獐乳行。代客買賣。以取佣金。此物嬰孩服之。功效最速。凡瘦弱之嬰孩。服後匝月。卽能肥白可愛云。</p>
<h3>誌神藝</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>江都黄漢侯君。風雅士也。工書法。於晉唐各家。無所不窺。尤精刻畫竹扇。能於長不盈六寸。寬不逾五分之地位。刻聖教序蘭亭十三跋等全文。筆致淸晰。精神飽滿。對諸原帖。不爽毫釐。近以求者踵接。特公開展覽於寗波同鄉會。以供同好。作品中如臨顔眞卿爭坐位全篇。懷仁集右軍書心經全篇。祝枝山書杜詩秋興八首。蘇東坡養生論。前後赤壁賦。及唐太宗·王右軍·王獻之·黄山谷等書法。刻來維妙維肖。允稱傑構。聞漢侯云。自二十歲起。卽喜刻竹。初時尚覺其難。奏刀每感不便。待細心研究。卽覺爽然。且能隨心所欲。一無阻礙。如刻一扇。祗須於扇骨之上。以墨點其行數。便爾奏刀。卽能得心應手。如願以償。靑山農譽之爲神藝。洵至當也。其最小之字。非目力所能辨。必以顯微鏡察之。始能畢現。余詢以目力有損否。據云目力反佳。是誠奇矣。漢侯年祗三十。而所造已足驚人。將來之突飛猛晉。豈可限量哉。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（六六）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十八日晨。諸幼年生來。願教余印語。亦願學華語。兒童笑容可掬。其意甚摯。其英語尚拮据。感我甚深。教長納侖米沙氏願余家住波羅奈。勿回中國。何印人之愛華人甚也。教長印人不害鳥。余住此房。門窗洞開。有時桌上方擺飯。而鳥來先令之矣。余亦不覺其煩。聞西藏之俗。人死則棄於野。供鳥獸食之。試思人身尚有被鳥食之一日。何况飯粒乎。善哉。印人與鳥獸可同羣也。印度學校中無食葷者。一律素食。据云若有不食素者。屏之校外。按印人身體壯健偉大。由此可證明食肉不過一種習慣與迷信。實際上與衝生無益。余著衞生書甚多。自余母亡十七年來素食。精神比常人有過無不及。足可證明也。</p>
<p>是日印度學校有四班學生行畢業禮。請余參觀并講演。其時間甚長。自上午十時起。至下午三時止。余十二點方人。已覺太長。中間間以音樂。一人擊鼓。一人以小風琴且歌且唱。不知何詞。學生皆大笑。中間亦添藝術。爲習内工者之運氣法。中國日本皆仿此靜坐。印度乃眞北門祖師矣。其學生文憑上畫一女人撫琴。云是藝術之神。學生領文憑。向教長及各教師行以手接足復接己頭之禮。卽佛經云接足禮之簡者。想見古風。不似中國校風之講平等也。學生領文憑後。又以各紀念品轉贈於學校教師。有鏡子名人像等。均陳於壇上。復以花圈掛於各教師之領上。學生領文憑。每人皆掛花圈。由教長親手爲之戴上。師生之間彬彬然。令人想見世界敬師之禮。無有如印度者。余因講演數次於此。亦爲我帶花圈。其圈以花爲之。在印度到處皆花也。復行燒香散花抺香禮。燒香者。以銅盤中置香烟。周行於面前。散花者以花瓣撒之。抺香者以香油塗於各人額上。有顔色。學生塗紅者。教師塗黄者。余至此。乃悟佛經所言。一一證實。學生前若干名人人皆有講演。余講爲中印文化之關係。蓋中國佛教雖不能自創。然善於發揮。如印度佛教雖亡。賴中國而推行東亞及世界也。下午四時始散會照相。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>？？？（三○）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>其時子良早已回進房來，聽夫人訓話。夫人也坐將起來，繼續伊的話：</p>
<p>「你當我閉着眼睛，便是睡着了麽？這是我試試你的心：不料你果然抛棄了我，往後面去了。你這人好没良心！我若是今天死了，你也應當在死屍旁邊，陪到天明啊，何况我並没有死呢！」</p>
<p>子良到這時候，好容易把辯訴的話想出來了：</p>
<p>「我並不到什麽地方去，因爲聽得灶間裏，娘姨洗鍋子，聲音很大，怕驚醒了你，所以打算走下樓去，關照伊一聲。」</p>
<p>「如此說來，你倒是好意！」</p>
<p>子良點點頭。</p>
<p>「好意，也就罷了」</p>
<p>伊告一段落，子良宛如遇赦的囚人，頓時放心了。</p>
<p>「然而，你到底太疏忽，我睡在床上，你那裏可以走開？」</p>
<p>子良又是心頭亂跳了。</p>
<p>「我要罰罰你！」</p>
<p>單說罰，不知伊罰出什麽來？子良只要不當着衆人，丢他的臉，他總辦得到的。</p>
<p>「我方才閉着眼睛的時候。覺得這床上枕頭下面，有臭虫。你替我捉來！」</p>
<p>說罷，伊下床來了。</p>
<p>「捉臭虫麽？我不會的」</p>

<h3>釐拆市互有軒輊</h3>
<p>昨日洋厘跌小、計早市爲七錢二分五釐三毫七忽半、午市爲七錢二分五釐一毫二忽半、結果較前日早市共跌一釐二毫半、銀拆則反堅挺、早市爲一錢、午市九分、較前日亦好一二分、銀行掛牌四分、劃頭加水五六分、做出匯劃票欵、早市二百○七萬、午市九十三萬五千、鈔票早市無交易、午市二萬三千、場外鈔票早市十六萬五千、午市十七萬五千、銀行交易、早市互市五十五萬、午市七十萬、各銀行洋戸往來收解一百二十餘萬、鈔票進出一百四五十萬、銀欵收解計華商收解票欵一百八九十萬、外商一百二三十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解九百萬有奇、進倉五十萬、出倉三十萬、日商銀行收解各欵四百四十餘萬、結欵一百餘萬、進倉六十萬、錢莊洋公單收解六百三十餘萬、銀公單收解四千三百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解三百三十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、解現數十萬、拆借洋欵進出一百二三十萬、小錢莊買賣、匯頭鈔票五十餘萬、輔幣市况、江南小洋計好一釐、爲六錢五分一釐早市同價、做出交易、祗早市三千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢四分三厘二毫半、午市爲六錢四分三釐、做出交易、早市十二萬五千角、午市三萬角、銅元爲三百七十七千五百文、較前日略短二百文</p>
<h3>證劵　債市趨勢益呆定</h3>
<p>昨日各公債現貨、上午未開出、後市亦僅裁兵一種開出一千元、期市亦出沉靜、計上午開出一千四百餘萬元、各債以環象沉悶、賣買大戸觀望、債價前日亦益見呆滯、前後市僅有半元盤旋、結果惟二十年關稅約漲一元、一九關及裁兵八月期亦好七八角、其他僅漲三四角左右、觀債市之形勢、暫時不致有大漲落云、</p>

<h3>紗花　華紗走勢暢達</h3>
<p>▲明日紗布進市半天</p>
<p>紗市仍平、毫無振作氣象、然大勢異常穩靜、蓋以愛國運動、日見緊張、江浙等處、對於劣貨業已檢查、不准通行、形勢熱烈、故本廠紗銷路頓呈飛黄騰達之象、細紗出貨太少、不敷供給、所以行情有漲無跌、惟日本貨價格較疲、似已受影響矣、期紗因粗紗銷勢不動、而大戸抛出、一時難以提高不過業外者及散戸視抵制舉動、一致頃向購進做多、明日上午因追悼死難僑胞、停市半天、午後照常開拍營業云、</p>
<p>▲人標跌而復漲　交易所人標前市開盤、以外棉趨跌、市氣尤疲、各跌四五七錢、午後聞實銷良好、各月回漲三五七八錢、成交計三萬二千八百包、查賣出公泰一千三百包、長豐五百包、申新七百五十包、義餘七百包、大豐八百五十包、</p>

<h3>棉市益形緊俏</h3>
<p>美棉市况雖虛弱、然本棉市勢十分緊俏蓋以天氣隂寒、有碍新棉發育、同時漢口方面、有一部份被洪水冲損之說、故在滬扒空、而金價堅定、印度棉價較昂、新多者活動而來、交易漸見熱閙、但有一部份抛出新花者亦不少云、</p>
<p>▲漢標續漲四錢　漢標前市開盤、以美棉平疲、市氣軟化而跌一二錢、午後市勢驟緊、場中買氣尤盛、謂漢埠又有淫雨之訊、各漲四五錢、成交計十萬零九千二百擔、查賣出恒益三千九百擔、天隆三千九百擔、晋豐二千八百擔、恒大二千八百擔、公泰二千五百擔、長豐六千四百擔、信誠三千二百擔、吉豐二千八百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>紗紗花又形虛軟</h3>

<h3>糧食　河下米市向上</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨各路來源不多緣本埠前二日狂瀉後、運商虧耗甚鉅、裏路初隨滬市情况下游、旋因客帮問訊轉堅、搬運滬埠米船减稀、早晨做開本街店交尚好、蘇常厚粳形勢最活、價昂近角早晚稻到稀、行情亦增一角左右、洋杜尖市銷微緊、糯米隨到隨銷大盤穩固、</p>
<p>▲南頭　昨各帮來源仍無多、城鄉店銷緣晨間小雨、且聞北市提增、人心向上、以致鮮料厚粳頗覺活絡、船戸見此景狀、均皆扳售、行情頓提一二角、薄稻到仍零星、寗銷雖木、然本街去化鮮高頗聯、市價亦增一角、形尚秀麗、洋杜尖銷雖不暢、但以貨薄仍健、隂化到稀、胃平、元元俏俐、勢呈穩定、</p>
<h3>義新絲價跌十餘利拉</h3>
<p>米蘭市場義新絲上市後、歐美絲銷曾有一度楊達、邇因人夏以來、紐約馬賽等埠、天氣奇熱、絲織廠停工、加以德國經濟恐慌、海外絲銷停滯、絲價大跌、雙特號每基羅祇開三百八十五利拉特號三百三十二利拉、上等二百八十利拉、各跌十餘利拉云、</p>
<h3>洋莊絲銷難進展</h3>
<p>紐約等處絲織廠仍在暑假期中、絲銷不動、絲電仍無轉滬、昨祇怡和等進黄廠經二十包、美大等進黄組絲二十包、價尚平定云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶英銷轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之針眉綠茶、英莊怡和洋行又復大舉搜買、協和·天祥·永興等行、亦均紛紛搶辦、交易頗形旺盛　市盤亦覺堅挺、珍眉市面、依然不振、英法行家仍持抑價觀念、華茶商堅硬不一、市盤難定、貢熙綠茶、俄莊尚未定期開辦、白頭莊亦無大宗銷胃、大勢仍難樂觀云、</p>
<h3>麵粉内地帮吸胃愈濃</h3>
<p>昨日粉市呈步俏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近期奸五角零、餘均好起二角左右、天時又未正、陣雨時行、内地帮愈趨愈濃、不能避免之天災、遂引起購買者之熱奮、各盤之中、内地帮均有吸進、投機浮多、亦爭進頗力、惟津帮因時局之故、則反乘勢回出、否則漲度當尤可觀也、結果本月份較前日好七釐半、八月份好五釐、九十月份好一分、十一十二月份好一分半云、又廿三日爲紀念僑胞、紛市全天停拍云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥跌度狂烈</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上午以洋麥報價仍好、各月份人心尚形鎭定、惟買戸甚寂、賣氣湧暢、市勢微呈疲象、迨至下午開盤、遠期人心、突見搖動、因四兩一錢半之澳麥、九·十月份裝船又定成七千噸、聞中華廠計三千五百噸、某雜糧行三千五百噸、一經成見、自然向市場盡力抛賣、所以遠期跌度甚覺狂烈、故内地帮如昧國外之情形、而純以國内爲背境、前途終有問題也。結果本月份及八九月份小二分、十月份跌六分、十一十二月份跌五分、現麥市面、仍然平定、廠胃亦不卽不離、開揚州·浦鎭·蓬萊·周浦·雙鳳·直塘·崑山·安亭·吳淞·黄渡·嘉定麥三千八百五十包、由福新華豐阜豐信大等廠辦去　至俄麥之樣子貨七十包、亦已做開、價三兩八錢云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新漳荔枝干已到</h3>
<p>漳州所産之蘭竹枝·烏葉枝首批新貨已於前日太古公司之太原輪運到、茲查統共計八百八十八箱、其中有百數箱係轉往杭州等處、各行自辦者約有四百餘箱、號貨不及四百箱、昨已見樣、顔色尚佳、身份稍軟、然例諸往年　確爲千燥、當卽開出二百餘件各牌蘭竹枝上好者開五十兩、高烏葉四十兩、次之减一二三兩不等、市象平平、</p>
<h3>糖市　抛貨中砂白市平</h3>
<p>▲太古糖劃市頗俏</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電、古巴現糖價升三一二五、紐約期糖九月及十二月與明年　五月份各升二分、惟三月份則升四分、爪哇現期糖仍無升沉、公會劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白、買氣沉寂、出戸喊價十一兩六錢、但少問津、中砂白十一兩、交易亦寥、市形平疲、太古車糖現貨劃盤Ｂ嘜成交價爲十二兩一錢、ＣＷ嘜十一兩九錢半、ＤＹ嘜十一兩八錢、ＨＸ嘜十一兩七錢半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩三錢至三錢半、趨勢尚挺、號盤成交殊寥、抛貨荷糖禪臣洋行售開八月份裝船二十號中砂白二百噸、價荷幣五元五角、行家進意尚淡、一時尚未克售通云、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵皮又到五六百担</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮昨又到五六百担、故市價稍爲便宜、如三六尺售九兩五錢、二六尺十一兩五錢、交易因客帮停辦、市象冷落、</p>
<h3>本廠釘因推廣銷路而跌價</h3>
<p>五金交易、邇甚閑散、故全市買賣零落、惟本廠釘、緣東貨受抵制關係、欲推廣銷路起見、跌價二錢、計每桶估七兩二錢、及七兩、想交易前途、此後定必有發達希望云、</p>
<h3>雜訊烟葉二千三百四十桶紐約裝來</h3>
<p>▲茶葉七百九十一箱裝北美、</p>
<p>▲麥粉五萬包裝往天津、</p>

<p>▲演詞紀要　朱應鵬演詞、略謂、在十年前、中國本無共産黨、自民國十三年中國國民黨改組後、共産黨乘機侵入、　竊黨權、在此時期、俄國成立了蘇維埃政府、查俄國自命無産階級聯合者的革命國家、實在是一個赤色的帝國主義者、俄國從前被俄國併吞的許多小國、表面上看起來、是脫離俄帝國而獨立、其實仍附屬於其下、而毫無政權、我們祇看俄國憲法、卽可知其手段之隂謀、（一）軍隊自己不能編制、一定要蘇維埃政府來編制、（二）財政預算不能自己决定、一定要取决於蘇雜埃聯邦、（三）外交不能單獨辦理、一定要得到蘇維埃聯邦政府之决定、像這種情形、其野心已可概見、中國共産黨足亦俄的走狗、倘被纂竊政權、多麽危險、這次國民政府、於湖南江西等地方、赤匪猖獗、到處殺人放火姦淫擄掠、因此派兵痛剿、這眞是救民救國的工作、我們要求中國之太平、人民之安居樂業、非剿滅赤匪不可、希望今天到會的同志同胞、大家負起口頭宣傳的責任、將這種赤匪的禍害和危險情形、回去講給大家聽聽云云、繼田市黨部執行委員陶百川演講、略講、剛才朱先生已經將剿匪的意義及蘇俄的一切情形、講得很明白、共産黨常常在外面說、中國　果與蘇俄聯合起來、能受同等待遇、剛才朱先生以蘇俄憲法之不平等來做證明、我以謂現在有一個很重要的關鍵、就是中國還是給蘇俄併吞呢、還是自己努力存在呢、我們知道、日本以日本人的力量來侵犯中國、而俄國不但以俄國人的力量侵犯中國、並且利用中國人自已來侵犯中國、這是最可怕的因爲他們一面利用一般農工、一面在我國外蒙南滿　地方、許可靑年、加入共産黨、招集流氓、組織紅軍（赤匪）在我國各省到處搗亂、使中國社會不能安寗、人民不能安居樂業、一面他們卽進兵滿蒙、實行侵略、這種裏應外合的夾攻辦法、比較日本利害得多、所以我們要救國救民、一定要擁護國民政府剿滅赤匪、現在赤匪　多的地方、是江西湖南等省、過去的一年中、鄂贛兩省人民被赤匪殺死的有三十多萬、避難異鄉、不得歸家的、有二百多萬、房屋被燒的、有三百多萬間、江西是産米最多的地方、有五千多萬担米爲赤匪放火燒盡兩省的財産受赤匪影響而損失者、有十萬萬、這樣假使再受赤匪蹂躪二年、中國前途、眞是危險萬分、我們要救國須先剿滅赤匪、一方面因爲剿滅赤匪、才不怕蘇俄併吞、一方面可以救老百姓的性命、我們大家是愛國的、應該奮起精神來一致宣傳、年紀小的小朋友、可以口頭向父兄演講赤匪之罪惡、使赤匪指日消滅云云、陶氏演說畢、由代表范更新等相繼演說、詞長從略、</p>
<p>▲大會通電　當演說完畢、由紹興匕縣旅滬同鄉會代表俞則人及范更新等臨時動議、請以大會名義發一通電、慰勞前方剿匪諸將士、當經一致通過、</p>

<p>▲中智新約　中智訂定新約事、現已决定移華辦理、余此次來華、卽專爲此事、該約内容、分通商及友好數部、以前曾由中國駐智利張代辦、在智京山梯亞歌Ｓantiage辦理、尚未達到簽字程度、此後卽由余與中國外交部繼續進行辦理、</p>
<p>▲設公使館　設新公使館事、智政府意、擬在南京擇適宜地點建築之、此次余晉京時、已與外交部作一度之接洽、但以採擇地點、及建築時間關係、均非一時所能實現、故對於在此過渡時間中、擬在滬暫設一臨時機關、以便與外部隨時往來、惟此層余尚須先電政府請示、然後决定、</p>
<p>▲在智華僑　在智之華僑、余雖不知確有幾何、但爲數頗衆、大都以營商或從事於工業實業等爲主、且極富有、性情均和藹可親、是以中智兩國人民、感表極融治、極親密、張代辦在智、亦極受吾國各界歡迎、此次余晉京時、王部長復告余擬辦一中智航線、使兩國商業更趨發達、如此余深信中智兩國國交、必更親密云、</p>
<p>▲對華感想　當余未來華前、卽已久聞中國爲一極文明而有深長歷史之古國、旣到華後、乃知此言仍不謬、余於欽佩中國之文明、及百業發達等情形之外、並且極感謝中政府與王外長及各界之厚意招待、</p>
<p>▲亦一記者　白氏最後謂、余於十數年前、亦一新聞記者、對新聞生涯、感覺頗有興味、其後脫離新聞記者生涯、入外交界、已十三四年、曾在波蘭任智利之外交官數年云、</p>
<h3>報關業請取締洋商</h3>

<p>▲以免日商在愛國運動時投機</p>
<p>本市報關同業、因我國報關業、漸爲洋商壟斷之趨勢、每在華商爲愛國運動、抵制日貨之際、洋商報關行、輒秉此機會、承攬裝運、故實際與未停裝無異、徒使華商受無形損失、且各國均無洋商報關行之設立、當時政府、每嚴厲取締洋商代客納稅、今稅國則不然、本市華商報關同業、共有元豐·招商渝·等八百餘家、日商有樋口·山口·益記·等三十餘家、英商有亨茂·茂泰·等四家、全市營業、日商占十分之三、當五九國恥未發生前、在中國之洋商報關行、尚祇一二家、祇代外人報裝貨物、自五九發生後、國人奮起抵制日貨、華商報關行、一致拒裝、日商遂乘機自設報關行、當時江海關未予禁止、結果使華商大受損失、五三·五卅·發生時、華商報關行、亦曾拒裝日貨、結果依然、迄今受日報關行影響已深、大連牛莊等客商貨物、現均爲日商報關行奪去、現日商報關行有意跌價、如棉紗一件、華商報關價爲二兩三錢、而日商爲一兩六錢、長此以往、不亟籌根本對付辦法、華商報關業、將因愛國運動而日趨末路矣、故該業除擬於日内派代表赴江海關監督公署請願外、并備呈向市黨部·市商會·請求轉函江海關、取締洋商報關行、以維商業、而保國權云、</p>

<p>▲遇險主因　東港輪近由船東趙君、出租於本埠亞東公司、行駛上海福州興化泉州一帶、上星期六、該輪由滬載貨赴閩、上海下船之旅客、約有四十名、照例二十一日晨、卽可到達泉州、乃於行抵地名斯白伊達島海面、將近雙峯之際、船内引擎間中汽營、突然爆裂、爐鍋亦毁壞、而中艙之船身、且受裂破、機器全損、卽不能行動、海水乃冲浸船内、船主孫全順、急發求救信號、於二十日上午四時爲日船盧山丸先見、由孫船主一再懇求、請其拖帶、而日船祇允將在船旅客等、代爲載救赴厦、故孫全順卽發一無綫電來爲載救赴厦、故孫全順卽發一無綫電來滬、略謂、東港輪在燈塔附近、汽鍋破裂遇險、進水四尺、船艙引擎間極危險、恐將沉没、搭客全體由日輪救起、刻托該輪拖帶、正在磋商中、</p>
<p>▲萬象助救　東港輪於失事後、爲保全乘客起見、商得日船同意、先將四十人送上日船、再由船長孫全順、向蘆山丸要求、請其將東港輪代爲拖帶往附近虎陽灣海灘、詎日輪堅執不允、及至昨日有電報告、謂東港已浸水、拖救實不可能云云、幸三北公司萬象輪、由滬赴閩、聞警往救、萬象到時、東港船内浸水已多、不能再拖、乃代發無綫電來滬請上海船東、速卽加派拖駁、前往救護、</p>

<p>▲船未脫險　趙君前接到福州來電一通、言東港已拖至福州、此信甚爲離奇、當由該船東發一電報、探詢致東港船長孫全順、略稱、三電已悉、船由何輪拖往何處、損傷若何、詳復、此電去後、至晚迄無復電、及至昨日下午六時、本埠德昌號接到福州蔡大昌代發一電、謂據萬象來客云、（卽救起之人）東港係汽管爆裂、並非沉没、惟無船往救、恐被盜刦、應速往救、（下略）則東港尚在該處海面、依舊未曾脫險也、趙君得電後、卽議營救辦法</p>

<h3>我校的訓育主任</h3>
<p>— 冰茜</p>
<p>我讀了三木君的訓育主任、不禁啞然失笑、眞好奇怪、我以爲我校的訓育主任乙先生、是太特出了、誰知竟是無獨有偶、待我把他介紹給諸君吧、</p>
<p>乙先生是新回國的美國留學生、他生得長短合度、並且很瘦、他有時穿西裝、有時穿中裝、大約他以爲西裝可以表示靑年的英武罷、所以凡有來賓參觀及紀念開會等、他便穿上很漂亮的西裝、否則有時竟會把皮袍駝絨袍等一古腦兒穿在身上、他面貌很像有病的、可是球藝很　、最高可惜的、他的耳朶不盡責任啊、</p>
<p>他第一次上課的時候、記得我們多人都恰巧遲到、</p>
<p>「下次不許遲到、」他板着臉說、「我以爲男女平等必須處處實行、所以我待女生正和男生一般、假如你們女生有不滿我這嚴厲政策的、請别來上課、」說着、把尖銳的眼光射到我們遲到的一夥人身上、</p>
<p>「好利害啊、」教室的右角所發出底聲音、頓時我們都笑起來了、</p>
<p>「笑什麽、」他更憤怒了、立刻全室寂然、於是他放高了聲音說、</p>
<p>「我們在Ａmerica、是不許學生後先生而入教室的……」</p>
<p>「Ａmerican　Students對于師長比你們有禮貌得多……」</p>
<p>「你到ＡmericanSchool去看看、教室内可有嘻笑聲……」</p>
<p>「上學期這本書是誰教的、」他停了一刻兒問、</p>
<p>「也是一個喜歡講Ａmerioa的、」一個學生答</p>
<p>於是又一阵大笑、</p>
<p>「什麽事、」他原來没有聽得我們笑的原因、</p>
<p>乙先生有一架留聲機器、他逢人便請到他寢室内去鑒賞、因此寢室若市了、每天一放學、便能見有許多人在他那裏、他得意的在開着、並且加以說明、</p>
<p>「這種片子、都是我從Ａmerica帶回來的啊、」</p>
<p>「又是Ａmerica、」人羣中一定有這很刺耳的諷剌、</p>
<p>最使我們驚奇的是、有一天他把那留聲機帶到教室裏來了、</p>
<p>「這是我新近買的幾張教育唱片、所以給你們大家聽聽、可以增進一些英文程度、」於是他開了又開、非唱到下課不停、</p>
<p>每次上課都開教育唱片、不是也要聽厭嗎、因此不得不兼開電影唱片了、他靜靜地聽着、把足前後左右移動、大約在練習跳舞了、</p>
<p>到那時學生的心目中、乙先生是患有神經病、</p>
<p>乙先生、待我們女生、是再好没有了、請你吃東西啦、教你打球啦、到你家裏來望你啦、……不一而足呢、假如我們有什麽事去煩勞他、他從不推辭、</p>
<p>「你今年幾歲了、」</p>
<p>「你有男朋友没有、」</p>
<p>這兒的男女社交、太不公開吧、」</p>
<p>「這裏的男生太没人格了、」</p>
<p>「我們在Ａmerica怎樣……」</p>
<p>這都是乙先生對于女生的談話、可是一件事使我們憤怒了、當我們聽得他對男生的口吻是這樣、</p>
<p>「女子是最可恨可惡的……」他原來言論是都不一致的啊、</p>
<p>「他一定有神經病、」</p>
<p>「李以前一定失戀過、」</p>
<p>這是許多同學對于他的批評</p>

<p>十一日的下午七時半許、我家因爲天氣炎熱、已吃畢晚飯、　中十餘人、圍坐庭中納凉、我在樓上正預備洗澡、忽然樓下家人喚我道三英、有客人看你、一我就三脚二步跑下樓、看見一個面不相識的中年婦人、我就很驚訝的問他尊姓、她很從容的告訴我姓力、而且說是同學女力士的大姐、力女士是她的第三妹妹、我就請她坐下、同時我很詳細看她的裝束、她穿了一件綠得很艷的印度旗袍、下蓋、開义、足足有一尺、脚上穿的全高跟黑色皮鞋、她就告訴我、她的妹妹告知我校中的一切事、甚麽某主任很嚴、簡直没有發問時的餘地、甚麽某主任、全體同學不滿意、下學期爲了某種關係而仍舊聘請了、還有各教員的小史、甚致於連舍監吳先生的字寫得很醜、而且有小孩子帶在身邊的情形、都一一知道得再詳細没有了、並且她還能講很流利的文縐縐的話、甚麽不好的朋友、少交爲妙、看見行爲不端的人、應該遠而避之、還有甚麽「在家靠父母、出家靠師友」……等等、</p>
<p>不知世故人情、没有絲毫經騐的我以爲有社會上的人、人人是保持自己人格的、所以我不懷疑她了、並且完全信任她是我同學的姊姊、後來我問她的無貴幹、她鬼鬼祟祟的說道、「到樓上去ＷＣ」、這句話更加使我相信了、同時我想她來的目的、也在此、欣然地伴她到樓上、並且還呌她洗了一把臉、她臨走的時候、對我道、「密司王、我眞開口不出、今天剛剛身邊不便、要到南京去、在今夜十一時一班、缺乏川資十元、請密司王借給我ＴenLoiars」、我回她道、「讓我去問問家人有否、」</p>
<p>於是我和母親商量、是否要借給她、母親說、「大約是滑頭·不要借」、可是我被虛榮蔽住了理智、想入非非的想着、難道這區區的十元也不肯借、不太笑話吧、如果眞的、怎樣對得住我的同學力女士呢、所以我主張借、母親就說、「那麽借五元、譬如落去子、」於是我拿了一張五元票紙到上面、看見她正一眼不霎的望着小弟弟手中的二塊現洋、叮叮噹噹的玩個不停、我拿了錢、付她說、「母親剛剛出去、我向嬸嬸借的所以祗有五元、你夠嗎、她道、「大約要七元」、哈哈、她在想小弟弟手中的二塊大洋叱、我就答她道、「就坐坐三等車吧」、她就很謙虛地告别了</p>
<p>事實記完了、可是過後我愈想愈是、騙子、但是不能肯定地說她是騙子、好了、今天證明了、我的同學朱女士寫信來告訴我、遇到騙子、呌我當心、並且據朱女所說的事實看來、却和我遇見的那套把戲、眞是換淂不換藥、也是說到南京去没有川資、結果、朱女士也被她騙到五元</p>

<h3>紐約職業婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>（七）生活寫眞</p>
<p>現在讓我們用顯微鏡來窺視紐約職業婦女的生活、讓我們看看她們在家庭中、工作時、和廣漠的社會中怎樣過日子、欲求眞像起見、必須將她整天的生活狀况寫出來、她們的等級就她們所賺薪水的大小而分、每個舉例都是特殊的、不過例外的事、當然也很不少、</p>
<p>每星期賺十元至十五元的女子、曼米羅雪德的一天生活如下、</p>
<p>「曼米、曼米、快起來、懶骨頭呀、」</p>
<p>「啊、媽、讓我再睏五分鐘罷、」</p>
<p>「這是你十分鐘前所說的話、曼米、倘然遲到、便要受罰、這是你曉得的、房租又要到期了、我又不敢上肉店裏去、因爲我欠他不少錢、還有……」</p>
<p>「好了、媽、我起來了、請不要再嘮叨罷」、</p>
<p>曼米從鐵床裏跳起來、她和兩個幼妹同住著一個房間、室中並没有香水浴等她洗澡、羅絲和康妮兩個幼妹、早已在吃她們的早飯了、曼米在著衣服的時候、他們兩個人的談話吹入她的耳朶裏、</p>
<p>「明年我也能工作了、那不是件可喜的事麽、也許曼米會引我到她店裏去、可是我願意進甲薩潑店、那不是一家很大的店麽、你單想想看、我要賺十二塊錢一月哩、」</p>
<p>曼米著上鞋子急急走來、立停了說道、「啊、羅絲、不要說罷、你不曉得什麽呌幸運、一天到晚站在櫃台裏捆紮包裹、並不見得高妙、你應該希望能夠在學校裏多讀兩年書、」</p>
<p>「曼米、你的咖啡煎透了、」羅雪德夫人很尖銳的喊著、</p>
<p>「啊喲、媽、遲了、給我一方麵包浸在咖啡裏、今天我不要遲到、新監督是不好惹的、」</p>
<p>曼米將咖啡和浸爛的一大塊麵包一吞而下、然後戴上帽子、怱怱出門、嘴裏喊道、「再會、媽、再會、孩子們、」</p>
<p>羅雪德一家在市梢租屋居住、羅雪德先生營經一種建築事業、當他有工作的時候、晨間老早出去、晚上吃夜飯時回家、最大的孩子年二十四歲、已經結婚、生有一孩、他做電氣工程的助理員、他的妻子曾充速寫生、她自以爲比了夫家的親族爲高尚、因此曼米對於她非常的不滿意、</p>
<p>曼米一個人乘地道車、一路上想到伊的嫂子、伊要想買一份引人入勝的報紙、可是吝惜銅錢、每天一份報紙、一星期便要化去十二分洋錢、倒也不可小算、暗地裏、曼米妒嫉伊的嫂子、伊不明白、爲什麽伊的嫂子要放棄二十五元一星期、在精緻寫字間裏工作的位置、僅僅回去看管家庭和一個小孩子、</p>
<p>這個早晨、曼米在地道車中得到一個坐位、往常卽使伊上車很早、也得不到一席之地、當車子達到市中心時、她在人叢中被男女上工的人推擁擠壓著、有時候她實在動怒了、便將臂肘伸入人家的肋部、喊道、「這是那里說起的呀、」男子們在擁擠的地道車裏、常想得些新鮮故事、可是曼米對待他們從來不是默默無聲的、</p>
<p>最後她到站了、祇有五分鐘的餘晷、她必須走過三連房屋纔能到店、到了衣帽間裏、伊要撳計時的鐘、所以一路上飛奔、撞碰了幾過走路人、伊並不管他們、倘然伊遲到了、伊便要等待一個鐘頭、方能上工、别的女子也極忙碌、盡向僱員的門裏擁進去、然後上樓、大家摸索鑰匙眼、迅速地將帽子外衣除去、攏衆的女子都着價廉的水藍或玄色衣服、這兩種顔色是店中特許僱員穿着的、撳了計時機後、曼米慢慢地走到自己攤位上去、她的職位在下層賣襪部裏、襪部的工作常常很忙碌的、在曼米看起來、好像每天有幾千里路的襪從她手裏經過、許多賣出去的襪祇要裝入封袋便完事了、别部份女子的包裝工作就難得多了、雖然她們不要像包襪那樣的快、曼米很覺自幸、她不要包紮毛毯、烹飪器具、或玩具、有幾天她在襪部裏像機械般的工作、還有幾天、她却幻想着顧主的生活、她愛每一雙的薄紗法國長襪、第一步將襪摺疊起來放入薄紙包裏、然後再裝入厚紙封袋裏、曼米曉得一個人祇能穿這種襪子一兩次、好像一握泡沬而已、伊對於顧主們漠然付五元一雙的代價買他們、很覺得奇異、這個買主當然是個女伶　、或許是個眞正電影明生、此外爲學校中讀書的女郎、將她生日所得的錢買這個奢侈品、還有許多漂亮顧客常使曼米聳肩、像這樣的婦女買這種東西、所費職工的光隂僅僅分把鐘、曼米對於顧客的是否眞正富有、或是外貌充足、她都不管、她祇是對於他們非常感有興味罷了（未完）</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>第一個要解决的問題便是佈置法軍後備隊的迅速參加英軍防區戰事、及英軍後備隊的開入法軍隊區助戰、海格總指揮和貝當司令對於這點前已分别研究過所預備的兵力不過若干師、現已到了重新共同研究的時候、並當考慮調用聯軍的全部兵力、這事情遂成爲六月十三日我分交兩總司令的信札的主旨、這工作在二十日完成了、</p>
<p>鞏固英法兩軍的防綫也是重要的、關於英軍防綫主張調遣美軍以及幾師英軍增防、</p>
<p>聯軍佈防的地位注重於遥爲防護巴黎、同時爲預防意外事變起見、另行佈置巴黎近郊的防禦、由東綫召回的居樂滿司令負責担任這種任務、</p>
<p>六月十五日在朋朋聯軍總司令部召集會議、克萊孟沙主席、（註·出席會議的、爲巴黎防守委員會副委員長杜美、衆議院軍事委員會委員長吕諾爾·及福煦·貝當·居樂滿·洛格·海爾·莫達克·及魏肯等司令、）卽把各軍事當局的職權劃分淸楚、</p>
<p>大綱第一步决定巴黎的防守、由福煦司令所指定的軍隊步步爲營全力負責、第二步决定假使敵軍直趨巴黎、進至泰朗河之滿克萊凡里線的時候、巴黎軍事官卽根據法軍總司令的命令、担任指揮防守疴亞斯河馬爾納河以及兩河流域間區域的軍隊、</p>
<p>同時、這軍官便要準備防守計劃、在巴黎近郊從安特里以至諾芹掘壕築壘、守兵的地位應當顧及迎擊和交通兩點、</p>
<p>爲便利軍務起見、更决定把巴黎列入主力戰區、在法軍總司令部設置聯絡機關、居樂滿司令便得完全明瞭法軍的狀况、</p>
<p>前敵後方種種佈置、無非是聯軍方面迎禦敵軍新攻勢的步驟、及我軍大守勢戰的準備、但在計劃阻止敵軍進攻的時候、我不忘記聯軍必須立卽準備改取攻勢、因爲唯有攻勢戰方能得着大戰的最後勝利、</p>
<p>前面已經選出兩個區域可以進攻、至於主要初步工作已由各軍完成、爲英軍之在雷斯河區域、及法軍之在疴亞斯河及沙姆河之間、但德軍從愛斯南河深入至馬爾納河之鐵里别墅、形勢爲之一變、聯軍方面因之産生一新戰區、</p>
<p>實則這也很容易看出、敵人的孤軍深入、鐵路爲其運輸的唯一適當路綫、而這許多路綫均經過沙亞松、所以這重要的交通中奩、一朝遇着我軍的砲擊、「鐵里别墅方面德軍任何攻擊必成泡影、」</p>
<p>當時我軍已經佈防完竣、唯有遠射砲始能轟至沙亞松、遠射砲火固足影響敵軍的接濟、但不能望其完全斷絶、要達到這個目的、唯有再用流動重砲及野戰砲、因須佈置砲位、我在六月十四日請貝當司令「準備進攻、奪取西面控制沙亞松的高地、這爲軍事上必爭之地、務使不爲敵人所有、」</p>
<p>第五軍依據六月七日的軍令、早已準備向鐵里别墅的東翼進攻、但德軍在孔碑方面的攻擊已經大爲和綏、敵軍在梅慈停頓了、這方面的進攻遂無足重輕、因爲和緩、我爲這個原因、便請貝當司令卽令第十軍準備進攻、奪回杜米爾高原、並須趕快在敵軍未能從容佈防之前實行</p>
<p>貝當司令於是立卽下令、限第十軍進至「普爾能米西朗埠之綫、」數日後、六月廿日、第十軍軍長孟琴司令擬定作戰計劃、由法軍總司令批准、</p>
<p>六月底、聯軍便在不同的區域裏準備了三個進攻的地方、就是雷斯河·沙姆河·及馬爾納河、我軍準備在第三區域首先進攻、這個計劃並不阻碍我軍全綫總攻的準備、所以全體官兵應當各自準備以待時機的到來、</p>
<p>這攻勢戰所取的方式以及進攻的開始的時間不能不細心選擇、因自三月廿一日以來、聯軍久經惡戰、損失甚巨、開戰後敵人着着勝利、卽使稍有挫折、也是聯軍以極大的犧牲換得、敵軍的實力已是婦孺皆知了、</p>
<p>所以要改善這個印象、最重要的是一戰而勝、假使進攻中發生了頓挫、萬萬不能使我軍陷於危險的狀况、</p>
<p>沙亞松鐵里線計劃中的進攻、應以愛斯南河掩護左翼、假使進攻頓挫、便不會陷於狐軍深入、兩翼危險的境地、</p>
<p>末了、我軍起初雖則希望只在一處進攻、聯軍全部的計劃應爲策應的準備、以便一擊成功之後、乘敵軍發生混亂之際、各路軍隊分頭前進、在某一處會師、這很足以增加我軍全部作戰的成效、</p>
<p>經過了三年壕溝戰之後、應使我軍重新明白行動的力量、及其練習和物體的靈敏、因須用一種淺顯文字、把這些軍事學識灌輸給新舊官兵、</p>
<p>因在六月二十七日請貝當事令作成全軍總訓令、擬定攻勢戰組織及進行的大綱、並規走教練時間、以完成參與這次攻勢戰的法美兩軍的訓練、</p>
<p>末了、我通知他、這次攻勢戰到某種時期、我將調用法美英三軍全部兵力、他們的準備至少要在兩月之内完成、預計作戰的兵力至少須美軍十二師、法軍十二師、及英軍七八師、</p>
<p>美軍的合作雖則尚在開頭時期、已星期望很切了、聯軍方面彼始卽相信美軍參戰的效果、現在這信息與日俱增、因此聯軍總司令調用美軍作戰、更須留心負責指揮他們的軍官、時時須依照他的計劃進行、（未完）</p>

<h3>Capital Anti-Japanese Conference Urges Diplomacy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Wang Jiazhen Reports on the Wanbaoshan Incident</p>
<p>Representatives Question the Minister of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from the Capital Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese and National Salvation Conference, including Shi Weihuan, Xiao Jishan, Chen Haicheng, Chen Shuzhen, Ma Jun, and Zhu Shanglin, twenty people in total, met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs at 12:00 PM to question the progress of the negotiations regarding the Korean Incident. Wang Jiazhen, Fan Guang, Jiang Huaben, and others received them. The representatives requested that Wang Jiazhen report on the truth of the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Korean Incident, as well as the negotiation process. Wang Jiazhen said, "My original home is in Jilin Province. The location of the Wanbaoshan Incident is very close to my hometown, and I have always been extremely concerned about it. The cause of the Wanbaoshan Incident is very complicated. Three years ago, I suggested to the Northeast authorities that if Japan does not amend its nationality law, the Korean residents in China will eventually become a problem. Last year, I went to Korea for inspection and learned that there are more than 1.6 million Korean residents in Northeast China. I deeply understand Japan's so-called continental policy: the first step is to drive Korean people to live in the Northeast inland, and the second step is for Japanese people to enter Korea. But Japan only cares about its development and immigration, and disregards the only basis for violating the treaty, that is, the Jiandao Agreement. Article 2 stipulates that Korean people are allowed to reside in the four places of Longjing Village, Juzi Street, Toudaogou, and Baicaogou. Japan does not even care about this and arbitrarily drives Korean people to cultivate and grow rice in the Northeast. The root cause of the Wanbaoshan Incident lies here. The immediate cause is entirely due to the Korean people digging trenches and building dams in Wanbaoshan, encroaching on farmland. Japanese police armed to protect their work. But the farmers in Wanbaoshan did not beat or injure a single person. Then anti-Chinese riots broke out in various parts of Korea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued two protests. The request for the withdrawal of Japanese police has also been sent today. This is roughly the process." The Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang came out to meet them at 12:30 PM. First, Shi Weihuan reported the resolutions of the conference, saying that he originally planned to invite the minister to attend the conference, and also planned to have more than 2,000 people march to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he was afraid it would be inconvenient, so he sent representatives here. The conference resolved: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to resolutely demand the Japanese government to punish the perpetrators, compensate for the losses, and guarantee the safety of overseas Chinese in the spirit of national diplomacy. Do not give in at all. (2) Please negotiate as soon as possible to cancel all unequal treaties between China and Japan and abolish all Japanese privileges in China. (3) Please negotiate earnestly to allow the returned overseas Chinese to return to their original places and resume their businesses. (4) Please severely punish the consuls stationed in Korea and those responsible for the case. Please pay attention to international publicity. Shi also said that "bearing humiliation and enduring hardship" is the traditional policy in China's diplomacy. If the diplomatic authorities still hold the spirit of "bearing humiliation and enduring hardship" in this negotiation, they will surely lose the people's trust. He hoped that Minister Wang would negotiate seriously with Japan in the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy and would not stop until the goal was achieved. After Shi finished speaking, the representatives spoke in succession, and their words were quite激昂(Excited, impassioned). Some people asked Wang to sign the resolutions of the conference and be responsible for handling them. Some said that if he could not do it, he should retire to make way for the capable. Some asked Wang to apologize to the people, and one representative asked Wang to send a note to the Japanese side, saying that the Chinese people's morale was unusually激昂(Excited, impassioned), and the Japanese side should be asked to accept all of China's demands within 24 hours. If the Chinese people take actions similar to the Korean incident, the Chinese government can also shirk responsibility. Wang replied that he handled diplomacy in accordance with the government's intentions and the teachings of the Premier. He would definitely do his best to handle the resolutions of the Anti-Japanese Conference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already reported the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents to the government in detail. The general policy must be decided by the central government. If he did not handle it well, he was willing to take the blame himself. If he only vented his emotions or opinions, it would not be the right way for diplomacy. According to reliable reports, more than 100 overseas Chinese in Korea died, more than 200 were seriously injured, and even more were slightly injured. The exact number is not yet known. Before the incident occurred, the consulates stationed in Korea warned the local officials, but unfortunately, the Japanese side failed to pay attention to our warnings, resulting in the tragedy from July 3 to 7. Now we believe that the Japanese side should bear the responsibility under international law for failing to do their best to protect them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is striving for this point and will never let it go. Shi Weihuan said that the incident was purely caused by the Wanbaoshan Incident. The Commissioner of Jilin was obviously derelict in his duty for failing to prevent it in advance and should be removed and punished immediately. Wang replied that he would present it to the government and consult with the Northeast authorities. If the commissioner was indeed derelict in his duty, he would be severely punished. Wang Jiazhen then explained that the commissioner had a lighter responsibility. The magistrate of Changchun County, the director of the Municipal Preparatory Office, and the director of the Public Security Bureau were inevitably negligent. Hao Yongde was especially guilty in this case. As for the negotiations with Japan, they cannot be effective simply by empty words. We should seek a better method than war to achieve success. Wang Zhengting continued that a representative asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send a note to the Japanese side, demanding a reply within 24 hours, otherwise the Chinese people would act freely. Wang replied that it was not difficult to handle the note, but we had to consider how we were prepared. As for this negotiation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should strive for it. He sincerely hoped that the people and the government would stand on the same front and proceed in unison. Wang also said that this negotiation will definitely not be satisfied with achieving the goal of compensation. We should go a step further and demand a guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again, and strive to abolish all unequal treaties. It was not until 2:30 PM that they dispersed.

<p>Pledge to Support Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese and National Salvation Conference issued the following declaration on the 22nd: All party members, farmers, merchants, students, women, overseas Chinese, and people from all walks of life in the capital deeply mourn the tragic massacre of hundreds of fellow overseas Chinese in Korea and the violence and arbitrariness of Japanese imperialists. We are holding the Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese and National Salvation Conference on July 22nd, and we would like to express our blood and tears to our fellow countrymen: Japanese imperialists are the enemies of our 400 million compatriots. Since the Sino-Japanese War, our country, where we were born, grew up, and gathered our families, has become the sole target of Japanese aggression. Japanese imperialists are jackals by nature and snakes and scorpions at heart. They have seized our Ryukyu, cut off our Taiwan, seized our Lushun and Dalian, and invaded our Manchuria and Mongolia. The humiliation of the Twenty-One Demands has not been erased, and the tragedy of the May Thirtieth Massacre has recurred. Over the past thirty years, they have used every means to insult and oppress us. After enduring humiliation, our 400 million compatriots are fully implementing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, eliminating feudal forces, eradicating all evil communists, in order to seek China's unification and maintain peace in East Asia. Unexpectedly, Japanese imperialists have no remorse and are actively aggressing with violence. Taking advantage of our country's difficulties, they do not hesitate to use base means to create the Wanbaoshan Incident. Our farmers have been brutally bullied, their livelihoods have been cut off, they have swallowed their anger and shed tears, and they have no way to appeal. But Japanese imperialists have lost their conscience and humanity, reversed the facts, and confused the news, and dared to incite Japanese and Korean mobs to brutally massacre overseas Chinese residing in Korea, disemboweling them and gouging out their hearts, and exhausting their cruelty. Hundreds of overseas Chinese were killed, thousands were injured, and those who were lucky enough to survive were all expelled back to their country. The loss of property cannot be counted. Alas, my 400 million compatriots, listen to this! Are those who are being massacred and expelled today not our flesh and blood? Are they not outstanding compatriots who have gone to foreign countries to win glory for the country? Any Chinese person with a sense of consciousness and humanity, upon hearing this terrible news from the sky, would not be shocked and have their blood boil! Japanese imperialists have declared war on our entire nation. They have made up their minds to destroy our country and exterminate our nation. Any of our compatriots who have the slightest bit of integrity and do not want to cut themselves off from humanity must swear not to coexist with Japanese imperialists and must swear to make a final showdown with Japanese imperialists. The 600,000 people in the capital are filled with grief and indignation and can no longer bear it. They are willing to rise up together with compatriots at home and abroad to face the national crisis together. On the one hand, they petition the government to vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy. In addition to demanding punishment, compensation, apology, and guarantees that the same incidents will not happen again for the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Korean Massacre, the government should automatically cancel all unequal treaties between China and Japan and Japanese concessions in China, as well as all other privileges. On the other hand, they will organize the Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese and National Salvation Association to fight for a long time. With one heart, they will implement economic severance with Japan, raise funds to relieve the overseas Chinese who were affected by the disaster in Korea, and pledge to fully support the government's diplomacy. Since Japanese imperialists have exposed their ugly faces, we should announce their crimes of injustice to all countries. Should the world in the 20th century tolerate this country that absolutely disregards international faith? We hope that our friendly countries who advocate justice will make a fair judgment. Furthermore, we would like to tell our fellow countrymen that people must insult themselves before others insult them, and a country must attack itself before others attack it. Our country has been frequently trampled on by imperialists, and at this time of crisis and hardship, there are still many who are willing to be Li Wanyong of China. The communists who sell out the country for their own glory and the traitors who betray the party and the country are all creating opportunities for imperialists. Who among us does not want to kill these cold-blooded animals that dogs and pigs do not eat? Alas, the foreign troubles are deep, and the national crisis is urgent. Fellow countrymen, can we continue to live in a drunken stupor and allow others to slaughter us? Our Chinese nation is the most outstanding in the world. We absolutely believe that we have the ability to revive China. Now, under the guidance of the Three Principles of the People, we have the greatest determination to avenge our fellow countrymen, avenge the country, and uphold justice for mankind. We will lie on firewood and taste gall. Now is the time to teach war with shame. There is no room for others. The more urgent the Japanese imperialists' attack, the more united our 400 million compatriots will be. Even though Chu has only three households, Chu will surely destroy Qin. We will never be discouraged or disappointed, and we will never underestimate ourselves. We swear to fight Japanese imperialists with our heads and hot blood. The final victory depends on the final struggle. The 60 million people in our capital have a firm determination. Compatriots at home and abroad will also rise up in anger. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese and National Salvation Conference issued a circular telegram, the above is a summary. Japanese imperialists are vigorously implementing their continental policy, invading our country, and doing everything they can. Their ugly faces have long been fully exposed. The bloodstains of the May Thirtieth Massacre have not yet dried, and the tragic massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea has occurred again. They are very sinister and cruel, and they are extremely hateful. All of us Chinese people must know that today, our country and Japanese imperialists cannot coexist. We should expose their cunning, announce their crimes, fight against the enemy with the same hatred, and work together in harmony. We should implement economic severance to show our determination to resist to the death, to support diplomacy, and to avenge the murdered overseas Chinese. Without this, we cannot protect overseas Chinese, and without this, we cannot save the country. We hope that all our fellow countrymen will rise up together to take on difficult tasks and wash away the national shame. We cannot overcome our extreme anger in the telegram.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Foreign Aggression and Diplomacy (II)</h3>
<p>Since the revolution, our country has taken on a new look, and the authorities have been working hard to sweep away the accumulated abuses and reform the accumulated habits. And towards diplomacy, they are more often than not encouraging themselves with revolutionary diplomacy. The people look forward to the realization of revolutionary diplomacy with utmost anticipation and prayer. But regarding the achievements of diplomacy in recent years, they have failed to achieve what the authorities usually declared to the people. Therefore, criticisms are due to have their reasons. This is why we sincerely hope that the authorities will deeply reflect on themselves today. In handling diplomacy, the emphasis is on preparation and policy. The reasons have been briefly discussed in yesterday's commentary. Today, our country also has ministers and consuls stationed in various countries. These ministers and consuls can be said to be the persons responsible for handling negotiations in various countries on behalf of our country. It is not impossible to call them the ears and eyes of our country. The responsibility of ministers and consuls stationed in various countries is not limited to handling temporary diplomacy. Instead, they also observe the national conditions, national strength, and diplomatic policies of the country where they are stationed on a regular basis and report to their own country for reference. The government then considers its own strength based on this report to determine the response strategy. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is like arms to fingers and ears and eyes to limbs for the ministers and consuls stationed in various countries. It should be able to achieve the effect of flexible use at all times. Today, can our country's diplomatic officials have a clear understanding of the situation in various countries? Can the ministers and consuls stationed in various countries report on their observations on a regular basis? We outsiders do not dare to conclude that there is none. However, regarding the international situation and national conditions of various countries, our people have never heard of a systematic report from the diplomatic organs, nor have we seen any special books discussing it. Is diplomatic secrecy really necessary to be so secretive? Regarding the negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Middle East Railway, without first considering whether the Soviet Union had the sincerity to negotiate, they dispatched a special envoy to that country. After many days, the negotiations were interrupted. They could not advance or retreat. This is an example of failing to fully prepare without first considering the situation. Also, the Soviet Union's establishment in the Far East has caught the world's attention. Regardless of the country's future, it is very clear that it is a country that should be paid attention to. Although our country has not resumed diplomatic relations with it, it is absolutely not allowed to suddenly pay attention to it. What is the national situation of the Soviet Union like? We view it almost like a mystery. Since the previous report by Mr. Mo Dehui after returning from the Soviet Union, the domestic atmosphere towards it has suddenly changed. Recently, Mr. Jiang Zuobin returned from Germany via the Soviet Union. His hurried observations on the journey were reported to the people, and there was another uproar in our country. However, the Soviet Union is still the Soviet Union. It is just that our country has never known it. This is also another example of diplomatic officials failing to clearly understand the situation of various countries. Because they do not know people, do not consider themselves, and are unprepared, the form of negotiations is that we are welcoming, accepting, and being passive. People are giving, taking the initiative, and being proactive. Even if the launch is initiated by us, we are often deceived and trapped by people and cannot do anything about it. Based on this kind of fact, if we say that diplomatic officials cannot clearly understand the international situation and the national conditions of various countries, it may not be untrue. Secondly, a country's diplomatic policy is a strategy for a country to adapt to the environment in order to survive. This strategy is nothing more than two ends: one is to take the initiative, and the other is to defend itself. Only the strong and powerful hold the policy of taking the initiative. Our country is limited by national strength and is based on the principle of seeking equality for all colonies and small and weak nations. It will never hold the former to invade other countries, but will hold the latter to seek to preserve sovereignty and resist humiliation in order to defend itself. Today, the authorities' announcement to the whole country to abolish unequal treaties can only be said to be one aspect of the self-defense policy. However, apart from this, we have never seen a declaration of diplomatic policy. We have only seen Minister Wang's statement when he took office that diplomacy lies in "no concessions." And not long ago, there was a speech on "using straight-line diplomacy to defeat curve-line diplomacy." However, these are all means, not policies. Because there is no definite policy, diplomatic negotiations often cannot be initiated by us. When something happens, it is ended with a pending case, or we seek help from others, and ultimately we cannot achieve the purpose of self-defense. Therefore, what should be strived for in diplomacy today is one for advance preparation and one for a defined policy. If we cannot be independent and cannot be proactive, the slogan of revolutionary diplomacy will ultimately not be realized. Is the people's disappointment and blame accidental?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams II</p>
<h3>Korean People in Wanbao Have No Right to Rent Land</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs have studied the issue of the dual nationality of Korean people and have come to the conclusion that, according to the provisions of the Mixed Residence Area of the Qing Dynasty, all Korean people who have land or buildings in China are referred to as墾民(Cultivation People) and not Korean people. These墾民(Cultivation People) are under the administration of China and obey all Chinese laws, and their litigation matters are handled by Chinese law. Korean people who come to China from Korea and have no land or real estate are referred to as Korean people. These Korean people shall not rent or purchase Chinese land unless they have lost their original nationality. There is also a diagram for the Mixed Residence Area Agreement, designating the counties of Helong, Yanji, and Wangqing on the north bank of the Tumen River in Jilin Province and Hongtu on the north bank of the Yalu River as the scope. Now Wanbaoshan is far away, 500 miles outside the Mixed Residence Area, and of course, it is interpreted as the interior, that is, Korean people are prohibited from renting land and承種(Undertaking Planting), which is the freedom of Chinese law.

On the 21st, Chen Mingshu ordered all units besieging Xingguo that those who enter the city first would be rewarded with 30,000 yuan. All commanders are bravely advancing. (4) The Party and Government Council is drafting a plan for reorganizing bandit areas.

In addition to heavy bombardment with artillery and bombs, our army also dropped incendiary bombs from airplanes.

<h3>Seven National Statesmen Meet and Negotiate Restoration of German Finance</h3>
<p>Short-term credit loan to Germany</p>
<p>France's unique objection</p>
<p>British authorities prepare to visit Germany</p>
<p>Large amounts of cash sent from England to France</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 22nd: Reuters learned last night that there was no unanimous agreement on the plan to restore German credit. The London Conference now seems to be proceeding in dim light of conflicting opinions. The current situation is extremely difficult, and it is expected that the fate of the London Conference will be decided at the plenary session on Wednesday. The conference will listen to some of the proposals made at the finance official meeting and try to assimilate them. Attendees of the finance official meeting are keeping everything very secret. This alone has triggered alarming rumors, and the responsible parties have issued denials that the opinions of the representatives differ. It is worth noting that President Hoover's new plan has not yet been considered. London legal persons expect the conference to end on Thursday. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson will send a copy to the German Prime Minister and others to return to Germany this week.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 21st: This morning's Seven Nations Conference lasted two and a half hours. Attendees all acknowledged that the most important part of today's difficulties is to discuss the method of international financial cooperation in order to quickly restore the solid credit of the German economy. It was agreed that the first step must be to stop asking Germany for loans. U.S. Secretary of State Stimson is confident that U.S. banks can continue to cooperate to maintain German credit and hopes that banks in other countries will also adopt the same plan and attitude. The finance officials met for five and a half hours in the afternoon and issued a press release at the end of the meeting. The wording was very brief, only saying that the results obtained will be submitted to the plenary session to be held tomorrow morning. It was heard that the most discussed issue was how to enable Germany to overcome its current difficulties.</p>
<p>▲National, London, 21st: Today, London is widely rumored that France has refused to participate in the plan to provide short-term loans to German banks without requiring guarantees, but Japan seems to be able to join. The French representatives have prompted them to pay attention to this situation.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 21st: The U.S. proposal to rescue Germany discussed the German economic panic, saying that the key point of this matter is to restore German economic life, and also discussed the political aspects of this panic, saying that the U.S. government hopes that European countries will reduce conflicts, so that the world can rely on the safety of European politics. As for Germany's current predicament, it can be said to be a panic of short-term loans. The foundation on which these short-term debts are based is sound and certain, but the general uncertainty in recent weeks has caused a major shock to the German financial structure. There are two forms of shock: one is the outflow of marks from Germany, and the other is the withdrawal of foreign deposits and the reduction of debts by foreign banks. Fundamentally, there is no reason for this action. The current predicament can be resolved immediately and effectively through cooperative behavior. Secretary of State Stimson submitted the new U.S. proposal to the London Conference, which was sent by President Hoover to Stimson and Yimu on Friday and has now been announced by Acting Secretary of State Kessel. What it advocates is that bankers from various countries should have an agreement to maintain the short-term debts that have already been lent to Germany, totaling $1,200,000,000. An international committee should be established as an international cooperation agency to maintain this debt, and it should immediately consider converting a part of this short-term debt into long-term debt. This international committee can be placed under the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 21st: The U.S. government's proposal to rescue Germany is in line with the opinions of important U.S. bankers.</p>
<p>Some bankers believe that Germany can overcome this crisis with its government's and national bank's strong plan. After domestic and foreign credit is restored, a part of Germany's short-term debt can be converted into long-term debt.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 21st: Responsible parties claim that although Secretary of State Stimson discussed the general idea of the U.S. plan to rescue Germany with officials from various countries in London yesterday, other suggestions regarding the German rescue can be considered. However, the U.S. plan is a requirement that has been considered and carefully deliberated and cannot be changed much. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. attitude towards the London Conference has been decided.</p>
<p>▲National, Berlin, 21st: According to news from England, regarding the rescue of German finances, the issue of political guarantees has been clearly shelved at the London Seven Nations Conference. The issue of financial guarantees has not been raised. The large loan of 200 million marks, which was previously proposed to be secured by German tariffs and repaid in ten years, has also been abandoned. The countries at the conference believe that Germany's current difficulties can be resolved with short-term loans and that there is no need to study issues such as political guarantees.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 21st: After the adjournment of the plenary session of the London Conference, the Finance Officials Committee met with the British and German Prime Ministers and the Belgian representative in the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons. It started at 3:30 pm and lasted until 9:00 pm, with only one short break. The results of the discussion will be submitted to the plenary session at 10:00 am tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 22nd: Wall Street is now gradually believing that the German financial panic will eventually lead to the resurgence of the entire issue of war debts and reparations. It is expected that at least the payment will be reduced. The New York Tribune reported that President Hoover's proposal to maintain Germany's existing debt has not aroused any responsiveness from New York bankers. New York bankers believe that helping Germany from the outside lies in reducing or eliminating the payment of reparations. What bankers are worried about is that even if debt to Germany continues, people will rush to withdraw cash when the debt matures, and another panic will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, London, 21st: The Bank of England announced today that it has sold gold bars worth £2,829,499 and shipped them to France. In the past eight days, gold bars worth £12 million have been shipped from England to France. The financial community is paying close attention to this. France is now working hard to accumulate gold, and its gold reserves are greater than those of the United States.</p>
<h3>France's Attitude Towards Disarmament</h3>
<p>Replying to the League of Nations in Six Items</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Security as a Prerequisite</p>
<p>▲National, Paris, 21st: France's response to the League of Nations' inquiry about the current state of armaments and its attitude towards disarmament consists of 28 pages. Its main points are: (1) Disarmament must be based on security; (2) If a country is invaded, France is willing to cooperate with it without reservations, regardless of the form, according to formal combat based on mutual assistance; (3) The maximum level of armaments stipulated in the treaty does not necessarily require other countries to regard it as a standard; (4) The general issue of limiting armaments contains more political nature than technical nature, so it cannot be solved with anemometric tables and arbitrary reduction percentages; (5) The reduction of armaments can be proportional to the degree of mutual assistance among countries resisting aggression; (6) Please pay attention to France's position. In the past century, France has experienced three foreign invasions.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Passes Through Poland</h3>
<p>Trees Uprooted, Houses Collapsed, Traffic Blocked</p>
<p>Thirty People Killed, More Than Three Hundred Injured</p>
<p>▲National, Warsaw, 21st: An unprecedented hurricane occurred in the Juping area of Poland, causing a rare and huge disaster. Internal and external traffic was completely cut off, and the report only reached the capital this morning. The army and medical teams were able to go to rescue. According to those who witnessed the disaster, the hurricane was truly a rare disaster. Thousands of large trees were uprooted, the roofs of many houses were blown off, and trains were blown off the rails. A car with three people in it was blown ten meters into the air before falling, killing four people. According to the latest investigation, thirty people were killed and more than three hundred were injured in this disaster. There have been no reports from the affected areas in neighboring districts, and the losses may be much greater.</p>
<h3>Russian Army Minister Arrives in Boli</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 21st: Today, it was announced here that Soviet Russian Army Minister Voroshilov has arrived in Boli, a city near the Russian-Manchurian border, to meet with General Belutsky, Commander of the Special Far East Army.</p>
<h3>New Discovery of Nagata Comet</h3>
<p>Confirmed by the Wilson Observatory</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Cambridge (Massachusetts, USA), 21st: The Harvard University Observatory announced today that the Wilson Observatory's (California) research results have confirmed the existence of the Nagata Comet recently discovered by the Japanese. It is not yet clear whether the Nagata Comet is a star in the solar system.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<h3>Telegram from Beiping</h3>
<p>To All Newspapers: I have replied to Chairman Liu of Kaifeng and the same in a telegram, which reads: I have received your clever telegram. All comrades are dedicated to the Party and the country, and we have the same enemy in mind. The message is circulated to all directions, the words are strict and the righteousness is just. I am filled with admiration when I read it. Now, the red atmosphere has not been calmed down, and foreign aggression is rampant. The country's progress is difficult, and the situation is extremely serious. We who have signed up for military service have long been loyal to the country. We should all admire the sincerity of the Commander-in-Chief who is taking on the burden of governing and supervising the country, and we should all be in awe of obedience and strive in time. Who would have thought that news of a warning would come, and a war would break out, attempting to satisfy one person's selfish desires and disregarding the safety of the overall situation? Anyone with a little conscience would dare to do this unrighteous thing? He is acting alone, isolating himself from the people, drinking poison to quench his thirst, and committing evil deeds that are difficult to take. All comrades have marked out the great righteousness and rectified the discipline. Not only will all soldiers across the country rise up when they hear the news, but all who have blood should express their sympathy. The reputation will spread far and wide, and the treachery will be eliminated. The achievement of pacifying the people is especially important. Clad in armor and holding spears, we swear to encourage each other. We have heard the sound of the telegram, and we respectfully ask you to give us a clear instruction. Zhang Xueliang humbly asks for your guidance.</p>

<h3>A Study on the Immigration of Koreans to the Northeast (Bin)</h3>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Since the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred, I have written articles discussing the matter, advising the Japanese, and encouraging my fellow countrymen. However, as of today, the number of Koreans who have immigrated to the Northeast has exceeded one million. This has become an extremely serious problem in our country's politics and economy. Although the National Internal Affairs Conference discussed this issue this year, many of the resolutions have not been put into practice. Koreans still live in mixed communities as before, and free immigration continues as before. Furthermore, disputes are on the rise, driven by a purposeful conspiracy and supported by a portion of the Korean people as its pawns. Thus, over the years, all parts of our Northeast have been rife with disputes. Infringements of sovereignty and all kinds of unreasonable bullying often occur under a planned and methodical course of action, causing significant harm to our country. Our government knows that this problem is extremely important, but it shies away from addressing it, and has taken no appropriate countermeasures or positive actions for a long time. It has been unable to restrict the entry of Koreans, nor has it been able to supervise their activities, allowing the advance troops of conspirators to come in droves, penetrating our heartland. The occurrence of the Wanbaoshan Incident was no accident. The future is long, and if this problem is not properly resolved, it is not difficult for us to foresee what serious situations will occur in the years to come. After the Wanbaoshan Incident, the Japanese government expressed its intention to negotiate a solution to the immigration problem with us. Its intention was nothing more than to use its cunning diplomatic tactics to obtain a formal basis for immigrating Koreans to our Northeast. The seriousness and urgency of the situation mean that our country can no longer delay and postpone action. Thorough preparation, planning, and appropriate countermeasures are now crucial. Otherwise, future hidden dangers will be unimaginable. Looking to the future, I am deeply concerned. Therefore, despite my limited knowledge, I will present the facts and express my views to alert my countrymen, and deeply hope that my countrymen will rise up together to discuss it.</p>
<p>(II) Japan's Policy of Immigrating Koreans</p>
<p>When the Russo-Japanese War ended, Japanese Foreign Minister Komura Jutarō had a plan to immigrate four million people to "Mongolia and Manchuria" within twenty years. Later, during the Terauchi Cabinet, Foreign Minister Gotō Shinpei also boasted of immigrating 500,000 people to Manchuria and Mongolia within ten years. However, due to (1) the climate and living conditions of our Northeast are not suitable for Japanese people to live in; (2) the living standards of farmers in Japan are higher than those of farmers in our Northeast; (3) Japanese farmers are not as hardworking and resilient as farmers in our Northeast; and (4) the rapid influx of immigrants from inland China to the Northeast. Because of these four points, Japanese farmers are far from being able to compete with Northeast farmers. Therefore, although Japanese political and economic forces have directly extended into our Northeast for decades, and they have been plotting to immigrate to our Northeast, to this day, the number of Japanese people in the Northeast is only over 200,000. Among them, employees of the South Manchuria Railway and other institutions and companies account for the absolute majority. Only three or four thousand people are actually engaged in farming and fishing. Japan's policy of immigrating its people to "Mongolia and Manchuria" has failed in practice, but it will never give up its original plan because of this. As a result, the "indirect immigration policy" has arisen instead. The so-called indirect immigration is to have Japanese people move to Korea, and then force Koreans to enter our Northeast. This is because the living standards of Koreans are similar to those of the Chinese, and their spirit of hard work and resilience in managing farming is also similar. Therefore, Koreans are used as the vanguard for invading our Northeast, while the Japanese monopolize Korea and reap the benefits. At the same time, although the Japanese rulers in Korea have exhausted their ability to suppress the people, the Eight Provinces of Korea still occasionally show signs of instability. The calls for national restoration are repeated again and again. The implementation of the indirect immigration policy will disperse the unity of the Korean people, and the movement for national restoration will become even more difficult. It will be easier to rule the Korean people. This is an important background to the immigration of Koreans to the Northeast. The "Policy for Promoting and Protecting Korean Immigration" in the Tanaka Cabinet's memorandum on the "Positive Policy Towards Manchuria and Mongolia" further illuminates the ruthlessness of its conspiracy. An excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>"Since Korea merged with us, it may be temporarily prosperous. However, after the European War, the American President advocated national self-determination, like an inspiration from heaven, to incite weak nations. The hearts of the Korean people were also incited, and an unstable atmosphere filled the Eight Provinces of Korea... Fortunately, Manchuria and Mongolia are full of abundant resources to settle Korean immigrants. As a result, the number of Korean immigrants is increasing day by day. Today, there are nearly one million Koreans in the three eastern provinces. This phenomenon allows the Empire to obtain rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia without seeking them. It can truly be said that the country has created great happiness, and it adds countless forces to the Empire's national defense and economy in Manchuria and Mongolia. It reveals a great dawn for the rule of the Korean people. The masses of Koreans immigrating to the three eastern provinces can open up the virgin lands of Manchuria and Mongolia for the motherland, so that the motherland can make progress. Furthermore, Koreans can be used as a stepping stone to connect with the Chinese people in every aspect. On one hand, we can utilize Koreans who have naturalized as Chinese citizens to massively buy up rice paddies and land in Manchuria and Mongolia. On the other hand, we can use credit cooperatives or banks in various places to provide funds to those Koreans with Chinese citizenship to serve as command towers for our economic invasion. We can also increase food production to save the country from danger. This is also an opportunity to develop new colonies. The naturalized Koreans are nominally naturalized citizens of China, but they will eventually return to our nationality...</p>
<p>They only naturalize as Chinese citizens for temporary convenience. According to our plan, if the number of Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia expands to more than 2.5 million, we can use the Koreans as a nuclear force for military activities when the time comes. Furthermore, we can aid their actions under the pretext of suppression. In addition, among the Koreans in Manchuria and Mongolia, some have naturalized as Chinese citizens, and some have not. When the time comes, we can use the tactic of 'selling dog meat under the pretense of selling sheep heads' to deal with whether it is the Chinese Koreans who are causing trouble or the Japanese Koreans. However, although our country can utilize Koreans to act in this way, we must also be prepared for the Chinese government to use Koreans to control us...</p>
<p>In addition, if our country wants to develop new continents, the protection and suppression of Korea must be even more serious. Therefore, based on the Three Arrows Treaty, we are allowed to establish police stations all over northern Manchuria, and we must greatly expand and fill them with police force in order to appease the Korean people and aid their rapid advancement... Although we have abandoned the special rights of the Ishii-Lansing Agreement, we can use the new problem of Korean immigration to restore our special rights in Manchuria and Mongolia. Under such circumstances, when we restore our special rights, no one in the international community will dare to oppose our actions under the law."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Fujiwara Kei also discussed this issue in his book "Eastern Provinces Must Be Taken Seriously." He said:</p>
<p>"...Japan's immigration to Manchuria and Mongolia, after more than twenty years, is only 180,000. It can be determined to be hopeless. The only national policy is to send Koreans, who can compete with the Chinese in economic warfare and have special skills in developing rice paddies, to Manchuria and Mongolia to indirectly guide the development of Manchuria and Mongolia and solve Japan's population and food problems. There is no other strategy for the Japanese to develop the mainland. To put it bluntly, Koreans are just a signboard. Therefore, the solution to this problem is related to the survival of Japan. If it cannot reach the highest level, the development of Manchuria and Mongolia will be dull, and the world will doubt the strength of ruling Korea. The solution to this problem is so important and delicate, and the solution must be rapid and fundamental. But what is the fundamental solution?"</p>
<p>"In solving this problem, the Japanese government must resolutely resolve the long-standing issue of commercial lease rights, guarantee the freedom of commercial lease, residence, and business... "</p>
<p>By examining the Tanaka Memorandum and the arguments of Tenggang Kei, we can see that Japan's immigration of Koreans to the Northeast is clearly not just a simple matter of immigration for food. Its conspiracy and ambition lie in promoting its mainland policy. And the ruthlessness of its methods and the subtlety of its implementation make us shudder. For decades, our borderlands have been under its covert attacks, blithely unaware, eventually creating hidden dangers in our heartland. Looking back on the past, how can we not feel sorrow? This is what our government should learn from today. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong and Wang Shuchang are Each in Charge of Two Routes of Military Affairs</h3>
<p>▲ Yu to Prepare to Depart for the Pinghan Line</p>
<p>▲ Wang to Personally Inspect Defense on the Jinpu Line</p>
<p>According to reports from Ping, since the apostasy of Shi Yousan, telegrams between Ping and Han encountered obstacles yesterday afternoon (the 18th) and could not be directly transmitted. The railway department has been very busy with transportation in recent days. Nine Northeast aircraft teams have arrived in Ping and are stationed in Nanyuan. Future arrivals will also gather in Nanyuan. According to a statement issued by Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the Pingjin Garrison, "I (Yu referring to himself) have not yet determined the date of my departure for the Pinghan Line. The special train is still parked at the West Station awaiting orders. I can leave whenever I want. My cavalry brigade, Bai Fengxiang's brigade, is still in Neiqiu. Eight Northeast aircraft teams arrived in Ping this morning (the 18th). More will be transferred into the Pass as needed. After the attitude of the Central Army in Henan, which had detained vehicles by Shi, changed, its plainclothes reconnaissance team secretly attacked Neiqiu. After our army fought back, they retreated to Baixiang. Shi, aware of the difficult environment, is isolated and his plan seems to have changed. Sun Dianying has expressed absolute peace, and Song Pang and others have repeatedly expressed that there is no problem. Therefore, Shi is not difficult to resolve. Chairman Wang (Shuchang) has gone to inspect the Jinpu Road and will return to Tianjin within a few days and then come to Ping. Pingjin may implement martial law temporarily if necessary." The Second Team of Northeast Armored Trains arrived in Ping from Shenyang a few days ago. At 11:30 last night, the 18th, Zhou Yongye led them from the West Station to Baoding. According to Zhou, the military deployment has been properly arranged. Commander Yu will go to the front line to inspect the defense in a day or two. He himself led the armored train to Baoding to await orders. The First Team is currently stationed in Xinle.</p>
<p>The General Affairs Office of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters sent a letter to the newspapers yesterday, stating, "To All Newspapers: At this time of military brewing, various newspapers are picking up unfounded rumors as news material, which is most likely to cause alarm and affect public safety. In today's newspapers, it is reported that Shi Yousan is acting freely, and that Chairman Han of Shandong and the generals of Shanxi are also unanimously supporting him. It has been found that Shi Yousan's act of betraying the country and inciting rebellion has already been revealed. If it is unavoidable to use force, this headquarters, together with the Central Army, will declare his crimes and punish him. It will not be long before he can be suppressed. Chairman Han of Shandong and the generals of Shanxi are aware of the righteousness and have been sending telegrams in recent days requesting joint efforts to punish him. There will be no change. The reports in the newspapers are close to instigating behavior, which is most taboo in military times. Therefore, this letter is to inform you that in the future, the newspapers should not publish any military news about Shandong, Shanxi, and nearby provinces, so as to avoid confusion. Your newspaper has a sympathetic understanding of maintaining the local area and will support this intention. If anyone disregards the overall situation and publishes intentionally provocative articles, this headquarters will resolve it according to law in order to maintain order and facilitate military operations, and to serve as a warning to others. This letter is hereby sent and should be noted. General Affairs Office of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force."</p>
<p>According to reports from Tianjin, the defense of the Jinpu Road is the responsibility of Wang Shuchang, Commander of the Second Army. Wang, accompanied by his Chief of Staff Chen Qinruo and the two brigade commanders Chang Jiwu and Yao Dongfan, inspected the defense of the Cangzhou area the day before yesterday. He returned to Tianjin by special train at about 1:00 a.m. yesterday (the 18th). He went to the provincial government to work at noon. At 6:00 p.m., he hosted a banquet for Ban Chan. At 8:00 p.m., he gathered soldiers from the Twenty-First Regiment at Cai's Garden for instructions. Brigade Commander Yao Dongfan also accompanied him to the scene. After Wang gave instructions, he gave separate instructions to the officers until about 9:00 p.m. Other troops stationed in Tianjin will also be given instructions in turn. (19th)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Shandong in the Serious Situation in the North</h3>
<p>▲ Han Fuqu Dispatches Troops to Guard Against Shi's Troops</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, the north and south of Shandong, Guan Valley, is particularly important in this serious situation in the north. Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu has expressed his support for peace and obedience to the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, all divisions of his troops are stationed in their original defenses and have not been transferred. However, yesterday he specially sent Zhang Yue of the Provincial Committee, along with Jiang Bocheng and Fan Pujiang, representatives of Deputy Commander Zhang, to Ping to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to request instructions on everything. Yesterday morning, he received a telegram from Jiang and Zhang, stating that the trip was very successful. Therefore, the troops of this province began to move towards the border between Hebei and Shandong to cooperate with the Northeast Army in providing appropriate defense against Shi's troops. As for the Zhao Xuande Brigade of Sun Tongxuan's division, which was originally stationed in Dexian County, it has now been decided to send Cao Fulin again to sit in Dexian. Other troops in western Shandong, such as the entire Rong Guangxing Brigade originally stationed in Dongchang, and the entire Li Hanzhang Brigade originally stationed in Jining, have very solid defenses. Yesterday morning, Han personally went to Xinzhuang and gathered the officers and soldiers of Cao's division and Li's brigade to give instructions, urging them to protect the local area, care for the people, and diligently train after arriving in various counties.</p>
<p>Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, told reporters yesterday that the situation in the north still has hope of turning around. Even if it unfortunately breaks down, Shandong will not fall into the vortex. However, the counties in northern and western Shandong border Hebei and Henan. When the situation is not peaceful, it is inevitable that bandits will take the opportunity to harass, and dismissed soldiers will recklessly think of summoning troops, thereby disturbing local security. Therefore, I have carefully selected the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of the counties in the northwest and replaced them entirely with those who have military knowledge, so that they can suppress bandits at any time and easily connect with the military, so as to achieve the effect of commanding as one's own arms.</p>
<p>According to a report from a certain party, Xue Chuanfeng, a bandit army that has been disturbing western Shandong for a long time, recently returned south from Pingjin, got on the train in Dezhou, and was accompanied by four other people. At that time, the military police were deceived and went away freely. When the military police discovered it, they reported to the province on the one hand and sent people to track them on the other hand, but they finally escaped. It is reported that Bandit Xue is now in Fan County and there are rumors of occupying two villages. It is also reported that Bandit Xue was commissioned by Shi Yousan to plan to recruit bandits in western Shandong. The provincial government has now telegraphed Rong Guangxing's troops stationed in Dongchang to go nearby to strictly suppress them.</p>
<p>(21st)</p>
<h3>Jiang Bocheng and Others Arrive in Ping</h3>
<p>▲ Clarifying Han Fuqu's Attitude</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, Fan Pujiang, representative of Deputy Commander Zhang, was ordered to go to Jinan to meet with Han Fuqu, Chairman of Shandong, and returned to Ping yesterday (the 18th) at 12:15 p.m. Representative Jiang Bocheng and Zhang Yue, representative of Han, came to Ping in the same car with Fan to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang. Jiang and Zhang stayed at the Beijing Hotel. Han Fuqu also had a personal letter delivered by Zhang Yue. The statements of Jiang, Zhang, and Fan are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Bocheng's statement: Recently, Shi Yousan's attitude has become clear. Therefore, he came to Ping to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to negotiate a military plan to suppress North China. After meeting and agreeing, he will return to Jinan in half a day. I have a very close friendship with Chairman Han and dare to guarantee his actions with my life. Although Han and Shi have a better private relationship, they have recently disagreed and are not as good as before. For example, Han advocates severely suppressing bandits, while Shi advocates recruiting them to expand his power. Han advocates that China should not have internal strife again, so as not to affect diplomacy, while Shi acts arbitrarily, resulting in a slight difference in friendship. Furthermore, last year during the Yan-Feng period, Han tried his best to oppose them. This time, Shi Yousan is attempting to undermine the country. Chairman Han certainly cannot abandon his advocacy of supporting peace, unification, and maintaining the country because of friendship. He will be able to abandon his friendship and uphold justice.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Yue's statement: The Central Government has recently entrusted Deputy Commander Zhang with the overall handling of North China affairs. This time, I am here on behalf of Chairman Han to ask Deputy Commander Zhang for instructions on how to maintain public security in North China. A few days ago, the defense of western Shandong was weak. It was originally planned to send troops to reinforce the defense. However, due to the proliferation of rumors, it has not been implemented to avoid misunderstandings. Everything will be handled in accordance with the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. The rumor that Shi and Han are united is absolutely untrue. Shi's troops mutinied because they received aid from Guangdong. Chairman Han repeatedly advised Shi, but he would not listen. He has exhausted his friendship. Recently, he also sent a telegram to Shi, but has not received a reply. This proves that Shi does not take Han's intentions as his intentions, and intends to endanger national peace and the overall situation. Chairman Han will never harm the public for private reasons and will completely obey the command of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. If the Central Government gives an order, he will do his best to comply. The previous time I went to Bian was to discuss the preparations for organizing the Lu-Yu Superintendent's Office. It is now ready, and Liu Yaoyang has been appointed as the director of the Superintendent's Office.</p>
<p>▲ Fan Pujiang's statement: This time, I went to Jinan to meet with Chairman Han and expressed my extreme sincerity. His determination to support the Central Government and obey the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief will never change. If Han had ambitions, he would have already taken action during the Yan-Feng era. This shows that the rumors are untrue. Chairman Han will handle Shi's mutiny in accordance with the intentions of Deputy Commander Zhang. Jiang and Zhang are scheduled to go to the headquarters at 4:00 p.m. today to be introduced to Yu and others by me, and then schedule a meeting with the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. (18th)</p>
<h3>The Attitude of Shanxi Generals After Shi's Troops Mutinied</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence, since the changes in Shi Yousan's troops, the generals of the so-called second and third parties have tried their best to maintain peace and have not made any concrete statements. A few days ago, Fu Zhan Kui came to Bing and was very happy to contact all parties. As soon as Fu left, Fu Shuangying and Hu Yiling, Director of the Shanxi Police Department Management Office, came to Bing this afternoon. According to Fu Shuangying, the mission of this trip is still to represent Deputy Commander Zhang in comforting the generals and conveying the intentions of the Central Government. The Shanxi generals have been holding meetings in the Alumni Association of the Fourth Army School and in various private residences for days, but so far there has been no concrete solution. Furthermore, Shanxi is now in a situation where it is unable to take care of itself due to a lack of horses and soldiers. Due to environmental constraints, it cannot be allowed to have any claims. The internal personnel of the various armies and divisions have recently returned to their defenses. Furthermore, the arsenal has suddenly suspended all work due to the implementation of streamlining. Military agencies such as the Railway Transportation Office and the Grain and Clothing Branch Bureau have also been ordered to disband. From a superficial and abstract perspective, there seem to be no military actions (17th).</p>
<h3>Capital Circles Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese General Assembly</h3>
<p>▲ Sending Representatives to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Lodge a Serious Protest</p>
<p>▲ Resolving to Request the Central Government to Designate the 7/3 National Humiliation Day</p>
<p>▲ Shouting Slogans Such as Economic Severance with Japan</p>
<p>The series of events in the capital, including the occurrence of the Korean violence against Chinese in various Shu areas, the Japanese imperialists' failure to prevent it beforehand, and their lack of protection during the incident, reveal their conspiracy to exploit the situation and provoke our country to fulfill their ambition of sending troops to Manchuria. This is obvious. It is believed that nothing could be more contemptuous of our nation, in violation of humanitarianism and international law, than this. If we do not swiftly plan countermeasures, how can we maintain our own survival? Therefore, various organizations have gathered to form the Anti-Japanese Protection of Overseas Chinese and National Salvation Assembly, which will convene at the Yang Gong and National Grand Theater at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. Xiao Jishan, the executive member of the Municipal Party Department, was elected as chairman. After feeling grief, people from all walks of life who attended the meeting were unanimously inspired to rise up. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Venue At the entrance of the venue, there were registration desks for representatives from various circles, with the Municipal Party Department Boy Scouts maintaining order. Anti-Japanese slogans were hung everywhere inside and outside the venue. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Department, the Overseas Chinese Associations in Beijing, the Overseas Chinese in Siam, the Asian Cultural Association, and the Federation of Eastern Oppressed Nationalities distributed leaflets denouncing Japanese imperialism in the venue to awaken the general public.</p>

Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 representatives from military and political agencies and various people's organizations attended.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Address Chairman Xiao Jishan delivered an address, stating that the compatriots and comrades attending the meeting today should have four understandings of the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Korean violence against Chinese: (1) It is entirely backed by Japanese imperialists, using Koreans as the vanguard to infringe upon China; (2) The Japanese imperialists are treating the overseas Chinese in Korea as weak nations, oppressing and trampling on them by any means. Our party must uphold the principle of supporting the world's weak nations, unite with the world's weak nations, rise up to defend the nation and the world, and overthrow the imperialists' ambition to oppress humanity; (3) The Japanese invasion policy is to move Koreans to Manchuria and Mongols and move their own people to Korea. Therefore, compatriots across the country should concentrate their efforts to enrich and develop the Northeast to prevent their covetousness; (4) The Japanese imperialists' persecution of our compatriots is no different from the atrocities of the Red imperialists. All our people should use the determination and strength to eliminate the Red bandits and overthrow Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Speeches Luo Zeqi, the representative of the overseas Chinese in Beijing, Wu Mai, the representative of the National Lawyers Association, Ma Jun, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jia Guomin, the representative of the labor community, Zhu Shanglin, the representative of the academic community, Jiang Mengchi, the representative of the Chinese workers in France, and others spoke successively. Their main points were: (1) The whole country should unite as the government's diplomatic backing, and strive to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrators, providing compensation, offering condolences, apologizing, and ensuring that no more atrocities occur in the future; (2) How long has it been since the Jinan Massacre, and yet this tragic incident has occurred again? We have to blame the weakness and incomplete resolution of previous diplomacy and the failure of the general public to be firm and persistent in economic severance and boycotting inferior goods. In the future, we must have an organized and determined approach to severance and boycotting goods, adopting extremely effective methods and adhering to the end, without taking advantage of the opportunity to seek personal gain, so as not to be despised by foreigners and mocked again for "five minutes of enthusiasm." It is hoped that the government will no longer collect taxes on imported Japanese goods to avoid excuses. Anyone who purchases Japanese goods should be reported by the merchant and severely punished.</p>
<p>▲ Representatives' Petition After the representatives finished their speeches, most of the representatives proposed that Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting attend to explain the diplomatic policy for this tragic incident and the current state of progress. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was notified by telephone and replied that Minister Wang was attending the Central Political Conference and was not in the ministry. Therefore, someone in the meeting proposed to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to question as a whole. After discussion by the presidium, in order to be cautious, there was no need for a mass parade. Twenty-eight representatives were elected as petition representatives to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition for serious negotiations on this case until a satisfactory result was achieved.</p>

<h3>Ningdu, the Base of Unshorn Hair, Completely Recovered</h3>
<p>▲ The Suppression Army Fought Fiercely with the Bandits for Three Days and Nights</p>
<p>▲ The Remnant Bandits Fled to Donggu, Xingguo, and Ruijin</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Ningdu is located in southern Jiangxi and is biased to the east. To the east, it can go to Guangchang and Shicheng to connect to western Fujian. To the south, it can pass through Huichang and Ruijin to enter Guangdong. To the west, it can cross the Gan River from Yudu and Xingguo to enter Hunan. To the north, it is bordered by Le'an, Nanfeng, and Yihuang in eastern Jiangxi. To the northwest, it is intertwined with Yongfeng. The Dashanling and Xueheling mountains meander between them. The mountains and forests are lush, with the Meijiang River flowing southwest into the Gan River. There are many plains on both sides, the land is fertile, and the people are simple. Ningcheng is located on the right of the Meijiang River and is quite prosperous. Since Zhu Mao fled from the west bank of the Gan River to the east of the Gan River and the southern part of Jiangxi last year, he has used this as a base. The pseudo-revolutionary committee, the pseudo-central Soviet, and the pseudo-military committee were mostly set up here. Important bandit leaders such as Zhu Mao, Peng Huang, etc. lurked in it, issuing orders, not only burning, killing, and looting all of Jiangxi, but also being the major camp of the Red bandits in the five southeastern provinces. Its importance can be imagined. Since Zhu Bandit occupied Ningdu last year, the nearby counties of Guangchang, Shicheng, Ruijin, Huichang, Yudu, Xingguo, Ji'an, Yongfeng, and Le'an have been invaded and occupied by the Red bandits one after another. Bandits were dispatched to set up pseudo-workers' and peasants' associations and pseudo-Soviet governments everywhere, using hooligans and ruffians to create red terror. The middle and upper classes had no other way than death or escape. Those who stayed in the local area were forced to join the bandits. The central government paid great attention to this. This time, Commander-in-Chief Chiang came to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression, with Ningdu as the biggest target, and the advance of the central, left, and right routes was also to meet in Ningdu as the most important task. When the left wing successively recovered Lichuan, Kangdu, Guangchang, Jianning, and Shicheng, the main force of the Red bandits fled to Ningdu. The suppression army also tailed and attacked Ningcheng, and a part was stationed in Tangtang and Gaotian in the area bordering Guangchang, Shicheng, and Jianning Ninghua to block the Fujian bandits from attacking and consolidate the rear. On the 15th of this month, the suppression army occupied Toupi and Hengtian to the east of Ningdu, only tens of miles away from Ningcheng. At that time, the pseudo-Third Army Huang Gonglue, the pseudo-Fourth Army Lin Biao, and the pseudo-Twelfth Army Chen Yi and other troops in Ningcheng attacked in full force, guarding the highlands in the Wutoushan Xianqiaoshan area. The suppression army fiercely fired at the bandit's position, with bullets raining down, but because of the uphill attack, it was not easy to succeed. From the 17th to the 19th, the suppression army used machine guns, artillery, and aircraft to cover the bandits in hand-to-hand combat, charging back and forth, killing countless bandits. The bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, collapsed and retreated one after another. The suppression army took advantage of the victory to pursue again, and the bandits abandoned the city and fled. The suppression army then completely recovered Ningbu. The remnant bandits collapsed and retreated in two parts. The bandits in northern Ning retreated into Gulonggang in Xingguo and southern Yongfeng to rescue Donggu. The bandits in southern Ning retreated to Ruijin and Huichang, echoing the bandits in Tinghang in western Fujian. However, the bandits were embarrassed, and the bridges along the way were destroyed to prevent the suppression army from pursuing. There were also many abandoned sick and wounded Red bandits. According to the news from the forward headquarters, the suppression army advanced lightly and quickly, and the bandits had nowhere to go. The fundamental elimination of the Red bandits will not be far away. Also, the Xingying received a victory telegram from Zhu Shaoliang yesterday, roughly stating that after our army deleted the front and rear of Toupiyi occupied on the day, the bandits Huang Gonglue and Chen Yi came to resist from Ningdu in full force. In the Wutoushan Xianqiaoshan area, there was a fierce battle for three days and nights. After our armies fought bravely and fiercely, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the bandit's entire line was broken and tracked and pursued. Our armies successively occupied Ningdu City on Haori. The remaining bandits fled to the old nest of Donggu. In this battle, countless rice and weapons were captured, and about 30,000 coerced people were dissolved, and thousands of ransom tickets were released, etc. (July 21)</p>
<h3>Ruan's Division Broke Through Fang Bandit's Old Nest</h3>
<p>▲ Red Bandits in Eastern Jiangxi Lost Another Base</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Fang Zhimin's bandit nest in eastern Jiangxi was broken by Ruan's division last night, the 16th. According to news from the Xingying, Zhang's brigade of Ruan's division set out from Lingxi Bridge at dawn on the 16th to search and advance to Ge Yuan, the border between Shangrao and Hengfeng. First, the bandits guarding Fengxiangling were defeated, and they arrived at Ge Yuan that evening. They defeated more than 2,000 Red bandits and occupied Fang Bandit's old nest and destroyed various pseudo-agencies. Ge Yuan is located north of Hengfeng and is the base of Fang Bandit. The victory telegram of Ruan Zhaochang is recorded below to see the battle situation on that day. The telegram said, "Zhang Xian, the brigade commander of the Division of the Profession, telegraphed Shen, the brigade set out from Lingxi at 3:00 AM to search and suppress Ge Yuan. The vanguard Li Regiment passed through Fengxiangling and encountered more than 700 bandits with 400 to 500 guns in the evening, occupying the hilltop to resist. After the Mei battalion bravely attacked, after two hours of fierce battle, the bandits collapsed to the northeast. The department arrived at Ge Yuan and encountered about 2,000 bandits with more than 1,000 guns, stubbornly resisting the mountain. After five hours of fierce battle, and four or five hand-to-hand combats, the bandits were unable to support themselves and collapsed to the northwest. They were also intercepted by Wang's regiment. It is estimated that more than 200 bandits were killed, more than 100 were captured alive, and many guns, spears, documents, propaganda materials, and books were seized. It was found that Ge Yuan had the Pseudo-Jiangxi Northeast Special Committee Cadre School and the Normal School and the Hengfeng County Soviet Red Regiment.</p>

<p>The agencies are indeed the bases of Fang Shao. Troops are currently being dispatched to search and suppress in the surrounding areas to completely clear them. I respectfully report this, Ruan Zhaochang Jian Yin."</p>
<h3>The Korean Border Gradually Returns to Peace, Overseas Chinese in Andong Scatter</h3>
<p>▲ Some Return to Korea, Some Return to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>Andong Express News, Since the Korean Anti-Chinese incident occurred, the number of overseas Chinese who fled to this area was statistically about 3,000, excluding those who relied on relatives and friends or went to other places. In terms of food and drink, about 150 yuan per day is required. The donations from all parties were exceptionally enthusiastic. As of the afternoon of the 17th, the total donation from all circles in Andong was 13,000 yuan in current silver. All circles in Liaoning are also very concerned about this. The provincial farmers' association, the provincial labor union, the chamber of commerce, the education association, and the press association jointly initiated donations. However, fearing that there would be an urgent need for funds here, the government bank first borrowed 3,000 yuan of silver dollars and elected Zhao Yushi, the chairman of the press association, Wang Huayi, the chairman of the education association, and Lu Naigeng, the chairman of the labor union, as representatives. They took a car to Andong on the morning of the 16th, and many people went to the station to welcome them. County magistrate Wang Jiegong and Zhang Hanwei, the chief of the commercial port public security bureau, led the three representatives to the first refugee shelter (Danggui No. 1 Platform). The three representatives handed over 3,000 yuan in donations and made speeches to the refugees, saying, "First, don't forget the enemies who made the Koreans harm us. Second, don't forget the country. We must first unite and be ready to sacrifice for the country when the opportunity arises. Third, those who harm us have failed. All countries in the world know that the Japanese police have the power to protect overseas Chinese from all countries and will not allow Korean rioters to riot. This is also the Japanese side's consistent claim. If it does not admit that it instigated this Korean riot, it means that the police are not powerful enough to protect overseas Chinese. Of course, all countries will send troops to protect themselves. In this regard, they will eventually have to admit it. Wouldn't it be a failure for them?" After the speeches, they went to various shelters to express their condolences and accompanied Zhu Fu, the consul of Sinuiju, to cross the river to inspect Sinuiju for a week. They then returned to Andong. According to the three representatives, the city of Sinuiju has been pacified, and all Chinese merchants have resumed their businesses one after another. They also investigated the total number of Chinese workers employed by Japanese merchants in Sinuiju, totaling 1,100, including 150 at the Yalu River Timber Factory, 160 at the Forestry Agency, 150 at the Korean Transportation Company, 25 at the Match Company, 120 at the Showa Timber Factory, 25 at the Box Manufacturing Company, 60 at the Round-in Timber Factory, 50 at the Kondo Timber Factory, 80 at the Shibata Timber Factory, and 200 at the Oji Paper Company. At 6:00 PM, County Magistrate Wang and Director Zhang hosted a banquet for the three representatives. At 8:40, the three representatives left Andong and returned to Liaoning. All the important figures in the city went to the station to see them off. In recent days, the situation in various parts of the Korean border seems to be gradually returning to peace. Except for one or two companies in Sinuiju that have suffered too much loss and are unable to reorganize, all other companies opened their doors on the 16th and resumed business as usual. However, on the afternoon of the 16th, there were still more than 30 refugees from Pyongyang who were all from the labor sector and were immediately put into the first shelter. They claimed that the suburbs near Pyongyang are still not very stable, and because they have been severely damaged, merchants are unable to recover for a while, and most have not gone. Laborers, like startled birds, are timid and afraid, so they dare not stay there. The leaders of the local authorities have recently decided that since the Korean border is gradually returning to peace, the 3,000 refugees living in the shelter should be ordered to return to their old places to make a living or return to their hometowns. The decision was made at a meeting on the 16th to implement the repatriation. On the one hand, they negotiated with the Zhengji Company, the Qialong Taikoo Steamship Company, and the four major shipping companies to charge half the price for refugees taking ships. As a result, more than a thousand refugees have returned to Sinuiju in the past two days (this route does not require road fees), and each person is subsidized with two yuan for miscellaneous expenses. On the 17th, more than 60 people took the Taikoo Ningbo wheel to Yantai. In addition to providing ship tickets, each person was given another two yuan for miscellaneous expenses. According to calculations that night, there were only more than 1,500 refugees left, who were all merged into the three shelters of Danggui, Northeast, and Dongming. The Xinming Stage and the Dongping Cinema, which were vacated, will be opened for performances after some tidying up in a day or two. It is also heard that the Guangli ship of the Zhengji Company is scheduled to sail to Qingdao on the 19th, and it is expected to carry 400 to 500 refugees. This is because 60% of the refugees are from Rizhao County, Shandong, and need to transfer from Qingdao. Among the Chinese residents in Korea, those from Rizhao County, Shandong, have suffered the most in this incident. Because they are engaged in labor such as growing vegetable gardens in Korea, after the incident, all their miscellaneous items were lost, so they were unable to return to Korea and had no choice but to seek to return to their hometowns. It is estimated that the refugees here will be completely repatriated between the 22nd and 23rd of this month. According to news from the Sinuiju Consulate, the consulate is currently planning post-disaster plans and is conducting a survey of the number of losses in various places. Zhu Fu, the consul, followed the telegram order of the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and specially submitted a note to the Governor of Pingan North Road in Korea yesterday, reserving the right to demand compensation for losses. The full text of his note is as follows: "Regarding the note, during the Korean riots, within the jurisdiction of your governor, in addition to the one known death on Zhongzhi Island and the injured in Dayudong Yunshan Beizhen, the remaining losses are still under investigation. As for the undisturbed areas, I am deeply grateful for your governor's order to the police stations to guard and protect. However, for the loss of life and property suffered by overseas Chinese in other places due to this riot, please reserve all rights to demand compensation to be handled by our country's central government. In addition to still requesting your governor to do your best to protect and prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate events, it is appropriate to notify you. I hope you will check it out."

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>The Story of a Father Digging Out His Son's Eyes is Bizarre On the 11th of this month, Jiang Agen, a farmer in the 63rd Waizu area of the Third District, was taking a nap at home when suddenly many people came to his house and dug out his eyes. Neighbors heard the noise and rushed to help, but it was too late. Agen reported to the nearby Public Security Third Branch. On the 19th, two suspects, Wu Degen and Shao Shengtang, were arrested and brought to the bureau for interrogation. Unexpectedly, the bureau suddenly received a report from Jiang Apu, Agen's father, yesterday (the 20th), stating that his son Agen was dedicated to smoking and gambling, and his family property was exhausted. He had a wife and four children, and life was difficult. He had repeatedly warned him but he did not listen, so he was angry and did this. He repented for this period and repeatedly stated that the two people in custody, Wu and Shao, had nothing to do with it. However, Director Chen thought the matter was too bizarre and there might be other circumstances, so he transferred the three criminals to the judiciary last night (the 21st) for investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Fushan Songqi Harbor Soldiers and Bandits Open Fire - At approximately 4:00 AM on the 19th, the residence of farmer Yang Xiaoyu in Yangjiazhaiji, Babao, about three miles from Fushan town, was suddenly raided by a gang of over ten bandits armed with many guns. They arrived in a fast boat, landed at the local harbor, and seized Xiaoyu's daughter, Fengfeng (18 years old), grandson Jiajia (only 6 years old), nephew Pingping (7 years old), and Xiaoyu himself (54 years old),</p>
<p>taking them all away together. They took them to the Haikou of Hujing Harbor and boarded the bandit boat to leave. Unexpectedly, when they reached Songji Harbor in Chongming Sha, they encountered a Zhenyu patrol warship stationed in Hu, which was patrolling the area. Seeing the suspicious behavior of the boat, the gunnery officer Ji Congchun ordered them to be inspected. Unexpectedly, the boat continued to speed away, trying to escape. At a distance of about 400 meters, the warship fired a warning shot. The bandit boat approached the beach, and they retaliated with weapons. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for about two hours. The bandits gradually lost ground and fled towards the beach. Two bandits were shot and killed. Seeing that the bandits had gone far away, the warship soldiers searched the boat and found the four hostages, Yang Xiaoyu and others, tied up. However, the hostages were pale with fear. They were rescued onto the warship one by one. The warship soldiers also found a rifle and twenty-four bullets on the bandit boat. Subsequently, Officer Ji Congchun hired a small boat and sent the hostages to the headquarters of the 13th Water Police Team in the city overnight. The hostages are currently staying at the team headquarters, waiting to be notified to their families to come and pick them up.</p>
<p>The Trial Officer Accuses the Party Committee - The former trial officer of Changshu, Gu Yushang, was previously involved in an incident where his wife, Fei Guoying, was allegedly seduced and eloped by the secretary, which has attracted considerable public attention. However, while Gu was in office in Changshu, he handled a murder case outside the West Gate and clashed with the Party Committee member Shen Zuguang. Gu then suspected Shen of obstructing official duties and interfering with the judiciary, so he resigned from his post at the High Court and filed a lawsuit with the High Court. Initially, because Shen was a Party Committee member, it was feared that the same-level government would be biased in the trial, so he requested that the case be transferred to the Wudi Court for trial. Three months have passed since the judge read the case, but there has been no summons for a court hearing. Recently, news was received that the High Court has made a ruling on this case, the gist of which is roughly: "The County Party Committee and the County Government are not subordinate institutions, and the Party Committee member is not a public official. You can file a complaint with the County Government where the defendant is located, without specifying a court for trial." Now, after receiving the approval, Gu will come to Changshu again to file a complaint with the county.</p>

According to Wu's wife, Chen, Wu gambled 18 times, and there was a list of all of them which has been submitted to the court. Zhang Yucheng hosted the first game in Shuangjing Lane, and Wu lost the most, amounting to over 1,000 yuan. The rest were lost in smaller amounts. It is reported that many of the 41 people summoned had their names misspelled, resulting in their refusal to accept the summons. It is said that only over 20 people received them, and over ten were returned because they were not in Zhenjiang or the names were incorrect.</p>

<h3>Letter from Juegang Hua Feng Reclamation Company</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the article on p.13, titled "Forced Opening of Dikes and Shooting Farmers", we find that it is the exact opposite of what happened. We have checked with the company's reclaimed land and found that it is located in the low-lying area of the Laoyu and has been heavily invested in by the company for dredging rivers, building fences, and creating gates. The Laoyu has its own outlet for water. In this instance, the people of Laoyu disregard the interests of others and gathered the Bao Wei Tuan to force the opening of the company's North Park in order to swiftly remove water. The company's farmers were outnumbered and did not retaliate. No farmers were killed or injured. The facts are clearly on record. The company's reclaimed land was affected by the disaster and the farmers suffered greatly. We are currently negotiating the matter based on reason and request that it be corrected to publicize the facts.</p>
<p>Signed, Juegang Hua Feng Reclamation Company.</p>

<h3>A Hard Fight, Shangda Loses Again, Hongguang Wins in the End</h3>
<p>▲31 to 27</p>
<p>▲Chih-Tze to Face Off the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Japanese Shangda Basketball Team suffered another defeat in its fifth game in Shanghai last night, its third defeat. The newly assembled Hongguang team won by a margin of four points, 31 to 27. The game was evenly matched, and the fighting was fierce. The scores of the two teams fluctuated by one or two points. Hongguang won the final victory.</p>
<p>▲Fighting in Stormy Seas, The Two Teams are Evenly Matched, Seven Times Causing Proportional Numbers. At first, the Japanese team scored six points at once, and the momentum was tremendous. Hong chased to 7 to 7, and then exceeded it 9 to 7. Unfortunately, the Japanese team progressed layer by layer, and Hongguang could only follow closely. In the first half, Hongguang lost by twelve to fourteen. In the second half, Hongguang continued to fight in stormy seas. The audience showed disappointment, and Hongguang chased to two ties of seventeen and nineteen. Seeing that it was not easy to win, Shangda brought in two coaches, Oya and Ueda. The two teams alternately lagged behind and caught up by one point. At this time, Shangda suddenly exceeded by four points, twenty-five to twenty-one. Hongguang worked hard and reversed into a tie twice. The audience was worried. There were still three minutes left. Hongguang scored another goal and made two free throws, thus sealing the victory.</p>
<p>▲Hongguang's Coordination is Not Pure, Hongguang is a temporary organization. For example, Xu Kepei has not played ball for four months, so there were often chaotic mistakes last night. Many balls were lost. The pass and charge of Xiaopei in the middle was the most spectacular. Although the team members were exhausted, they still tried their best and finally defeated the enemy.</p>
<p>▲The Date for the Chih-Tze Shanghai Game is Set, Shangda will rest tomorrow, and Chih-Tze will fight the day after tomorrow. The Shanghai Jiang Affiliated Middle School will play on Saturday. The Labor University will not be competing in the name of the school, or there will be a competition.</p>

<h3>Boxing Expert's View on Heavyweight Boxing Masters</h3>
<p>▲Neither Xia Gai nor Xue Molin are All-Around Talents</p>
<p>▲The Future Hegemon Should Be Waggs</p>
<p>New York, July 1st – Jack McAuliffe, former world lightweight boxing champion, who was able to maintain his glory during his active years and has now retired, uses his expert eye to comment on the famous heavyweight boxers of various countries today. According to his observation, the so-called champion today is, in reality, only fifty percent worthy of the name, but fortunately, newcomers are gradually improving. His individual assessments are left below, so that we can know the true abilities of these great names today.</p>
<p>▲Xia Gai – Above Average, Sometimes Good, Sometimes Bad</p>
<p>▲Shi Tuo Libolin – Mr. Shi's Opening Resembles the Attitude of a Champion,</p>
<p>but the result is unpleasant.</p>
<p>▲Xue Molin – Good at Swinging Punches, Familiar with the Essence, but Not an All-Around Boxing Talent.</p>
<p>▲Laolun – Possesses All Kinds of Skills, but Lacks the Main Talent of a Boxer, Namely, Lacks the Final Powerful Blow.</p>
<p>▲Kanala and Kembaoluo – A Pair with Extremely Suitable Physique, but Their Skills Cannot Be Ranked Among the First-Class, and Kanala Should Not Practice Boxing, He Should Join the Circus as an Actor.</p>
<p>▲Xia Ai Fu – A Rising Star Worth Looking Forward To, If There is No Special Talent to Rival Him, He Can Also Dominate Everything.</p>
<p>▲Mi Gai Huage – Able to Transcend All Famous Masters, Only This Mi Gai Ge, Huage, the Middleweight Boxing Champion, Before His Retirement, Was Victorious in a Hundred Battles, Now Suddenly Leaping onto the Heavyweight Stage, He Will Surely Achieve Something. He is Indeed the Heavyweight Champion in My Mind, With All His Skills, He Can Knock Down All the So-Called Great Names of Today. The United States Will Therefore Produce a Valuable World Boxing Championship.</p>
<h3>The Victorious Sino-Portuguese Southern Tour Team Before the Departure of the Big Army (1)</h3>
<p>▲Both Teams Defeated the Hong Kong Army Team</p>

In less than fifteen minutes, Mai Guodong scored a goal out of nowhere, and then the Southern Tour Team was attacked. Wei Lushi then shot a goal, hitting the center post and bouncing back. Da Weixun was about to add a foot, but fortunately, Chen Xipei was quick-witted and shot it out with one hand. Li Guozhao passed the ball to Lu Qiyun, Lu passed it to Deng Guangsen, and then passed it to the center. Lu lifted his foot, and the ball went into the net. But after scoring one and conceding one, not long after the central kick-off, Mai Ge went straight to the goal alone. Chen Xipei could not catch up, and the first half ended with a score of two to one. At the beginning of the second half, the Southern Tour Team was forced to take a corner kick, and Jin Pi Lu Zhu Da Weichen headed it in, making it a draw. The Southern Tour Team was greatly encouraged, so soon Mai Su won back one. After that, there were continuous attacks, and the Army's left winger, Mai Ge, made another draw. Fortunately, Li Guozhao and Li Yichen successively won two goals. In the last five minutes, Lin Men struggled and finally scored another goal, so the Southern Tour Team won the first session with a score of five to four.</p>

<p>▲Few words prevent idle chatter. Quiet cultivation leads to longevity.</p>
<p>▲Meeting high officials and nobles is not as good as talking to peddlers and vendors.</p>
<p>▲When doing things, one should think one step further. When in a situation, one should think one step back.</p>
<p>▲People only know how to keep themselves clean, but do not know how to cleanse their hearts. Therefore, there are many base and filthy people in the world.</p>
<p>▲We live in this troubled world. Even if we cannot be optimistic, we should be philosophical.</p>
<p>▲Money and spirit should not be wasted. Waste leads to ruin.</p>
<p>▲If everyone could understand the true meaning of the saying "How many years can one live to be a hundred?", countless disputes would be avoided in the world.</p>
<p>▲Fear of difficulty and complacency are obstacles to all undertakings.</p>

<p>▲Although the male is good at killing, sometimes it is no match for the power of the female.</p>
<p>▲When young people's blood is not yet settled and their foundation is not yet established, they want to embark on the road of love. The danger is not only falling down.</p>
<p>▲"When rich and noble, relatives are in awe" is the snobbish attitude of the ancients. However, in today's society, "rich and noble" should be replaced by "poor and lowly."</p>
<p>▲It is advisable to look ahead and behind in everything. Unexpectedly, the law also commits the fault of "looking ahead but not behind." (A lawyer surnamed Ren was accused by his wife of sodomy. The prosecutor dismissed the case. The reason is that the law has no clear provisions on whether the anus should be entered.)</p>
<h3>The Perils of Siberian Travel (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Zhongyuan, who studied radio science in Germany, traveled from Germany to Japan this time, passing through Siberia and arriving in Shanghai via Manchuria. He is currently waiting for a ship to cross the East Sea to continue his investigation and research. Yesterday, he told reporters about the perilous situation on the way to Siberia, which shows the economic panic and domestic disorder in Soviet Russia. I will now classify and summarize it as follows.</p>
<p>▲Ruble Oddities – The economic situation in Russia, due to its low international status, has caused the ruble's market value to plummet. In Berlin, one mark can be exchanged for more than fifteen rubles. One US dollar can be exchanged for more than fifty rubles. In Manchuria, one Chinese currency yuan can also be exchanged for twelve rubles. When a traveler enters Russian territory, customs officials conduct extremely strict searches, prohibiting the carrying of foreign currency. They must also exchange Russian currency at the exchange offices attached to the stations. However, the money that travelers carry with them is mostly British pounds or US dollars. In Russia, each US dollar is only exchanged for 1.94 rubles. If the remaining rubles are converted into US dollars when leaving the country, two rubles are converted into one US dollar. The disorder of the exchange rate is such.</p>
<p>▲Soaring Ticket Prices – The ticket price of the international Liche train on the Siberian Railway was increased by one-half by Soviet Russia without authorization in August of last year. It was increased by 25% in March of this year. It was increased by another 25% starting in June. In less than a year, it has increased tenfold. However, the ticket prices for China, Germany, and Poland remain the same. This has now aroused protests from all parties. The negotiations are being handled, but Russia has not given a concrete answer. Furthermore, Chinese travelers must pay an additional telegraph fee of 25 marks per person before their passports are signed, which is also a strange thing.</p>
<p>▲Restrictions on Expenses – Travelers, regardless of whether they are in hard or soft berths (that is, the difference between third-class and first and second-class cars), can pre-purchase meal tickets, worth US$23.10. They can only be used for seven days in Russia. According to the new regulations of Soviet Russia, each person must spend at least 7.5 rubles or US$3.87 per day during these seven days, for a total of more than US$27 in seven days. In addition to buying meal tickets, if this amount is not used up, it will be deducted by the customs officials when leaving the country after inspection and calculation. Several students traveling with Mr. Cao had their remaining money confiscated by the Red Russian customs officers, without any reason being announced. They do not care about travelers lacking funds.</p>
<p>▲Equipment in the Car – Third-class cars require a separate rental for berths. A thin mat is used as a mattress. A tablecloth is used as a blanket. It costs US$1.50 for every three nights. The swaying is very painful. In the summer, dust and sand fly. If you open the window, the air is dirty. If you close the window, it is stuffy and hot. There is no bathroom. There is only boiling water for washing. The color is scorched yellow, half mixed with sand and soil. It is directly discharged from the locomotive. There is no doctor. The conductor and attendants all have fierce faces and are not dressed neatly. And no one can speak English, German, or French. It is very inconvenient to communicate.</p>
<h3>A Record of What I Saw at the Jiangyin Garden Hotel</h3>
<p>— Yu Bai</p>
<p>Last year, I passed through Jiangyin and stayed at the Garden Hotel in Liu Ling Lane, South Gate. The name "Garden" is truly worthy of the name here. This place is a large and beautiful garden, called Yi Yuan. It was built by Grand Scribe Zhu, a former Qing Dynasty scholar. A part of the room was opened as a hotel, not intended to make a profit, but to make friends with the world. The layout of the garden is both elegant and neat, making people linger and unwilling to leave. There is a couplet hanging in the hall, elegant and neat. I will record it here for the public to enjoy. "In troubled times, do not worry too much. Let him be a viper or a snake. Just wander in Zhu's Yi Yuan, be content with your lot, and sell yourself for eternity." A floating life should indulge in wine, do not ask about slaying the dragon dog. And walk into Liu Ling's old lane. When you have nothing to do, I advise you to have another cup." There is a talking parrot in the garden that is good at calling "Huang Bao Che" (rickshaw), which is clear and crisp to hear. There is also a green-haired turtle, supplied in a pot. From a distance, it looks like lush green grass, emerald green. To this day, I do not know if it still exists.</p>
<h3>Musk Deer Milk</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chang</p>
<p>The musk deer is similar to a deer but smaller, without horns, and its fur is brownish-yellow. Its milk is extremely nutritious, surpassing cow and goat milk. In western Zhejiang, such as Hangzhou, Yuyao, Wu'an, etc., many people use it as a tonic. However, the method of obtaining milk is not like squeezing it from the nipples of cows and goats, but taking it from the stomach of a small musk deer. Therefore, to obtain musk deer milk, one must first capture a small musk deer. I will now record the capture of small musk deer and the extraction of milk as follows.</p>
<p>Musk deer live in the mountains and forests in autumn and winter, and in the marshes in spring and summer. Every year around the time of Xiaoman (Minor Full), is their childbearing period. Each litter usually has three or four offspring. They are often born in the shallow grass at the foot of mountains or in flat marshy grasslands (without water). People who capture small musk deer to obtain musk deer milk usually go to the mountains and marshes after Xiaoman, with companions holding sticks to search through the grass. If they catch one, they immediately kill it. And dig out its stomach. Or sell it to others on the spot, or take it back and take out its milk. Put it in a cloth and press it to dry. Wrap it in bamboo shoots and place it next to you to allow it to absorb human energy. Then sell it gradually. Its value is expensive. Each tael (ounce) requires about twenty silver dollars.</p>
<p>The reason why the small musk deer is killed immediately after being caught is that after being caught, it often spits out the milk in its stomach, or cries out loudly. When it cries out, its milk is digested with the sound. This is probably the same as when a musk deer is caught, it immediately tears its musk gland with its claws.</p>
<p>Capturing small musk deer is not easy. Both the old and small musk deer are extremely clever. After the small musk deer are born, the old musk deer will hide each small musk deer in different places. The positions in which they are hidden may form a square or a triangle. And each musk deer must be moved once a day. And the distance between each musk deer is moved farther and farther. When they are first born, the places where each musk deer is hidden are only a few steps apart. Afterwards, they gradually move away, up to about a mile. The reason why the old musk deer does this is that, firstly, it is easier to remember when breastfeeding. The old musk deer only breastfeeds one offspring a day, rotating in a cycle. Secondly, to prevent being wiped out in one fell swoop when an enemy attacks. As for the small musk deer, they are also very cunning. They hide in the grass all day long. People do not move when they reach them. Even if they are trampled to death, they do not make a sound. They must wait for the capturer to reach out and urge them before they jump and flee. Sometimes they immerse themselves in the water, slightly revealing their mouths and noses on the surface of the water, covered with algae to avoid human eyes. Therefore, capturers often miss them.</p>
<p>Once a small musk deer drinks water from the Xia Zhi (Summer Solstice), its feet will have strength and it will be able to escape far when encountering an enemy, so it is not easy to catch at this time. In fact, small musk deer can eat tender grass slightly by the time of the Summer Solstice, so their feet are stronger.</p>
<p>Obtaining a small musk deer is a fortunate thing. But there is still good luck and bad luck among them. The acquired are divided into empty stomach and full stomach. Those with an empty stomach have not been breastfed for two or three days. The milk in the stomach has been almost completely digested. Those with a full stomach have just been breastfed last night. The stomach is full of milk. The one with the most milk can get two or three taels (ounces) after being dried, worth about thirty or forty silver dollars. Those who get it are indeed lucky.</p>
<p>Musk deer milk produced in Wukang is the best. Those who know how to identify it can tell. The county has a musk deer milk shop that buys and sells for customers to earn commissions. This thing has the fastest effect when babies take it. All thin and weak babies can become fat, white, and lovely within a month after taking it.</p>
<h3>A Record of Divine Art</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Hanhous of Jiangdu is an elegant gentleman who is skilled in calligraphy. He has studied all the schools of Jin and Tang. He is especially good at carving bamboo fans. He can carve the full text of the Sacred Teachings Preface, the Thirteen Prefaces of the Orchid Pavilion, etc., in a space no more than six inches long and no more than five minutes wide. The strokes are clear and the spirit is full. They are not bad at all compared to the original posts. Recently, he has been sought after by many people and has specially opened an exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association for the enjoyment of enthusiasts. Among his works, such as the full text of Yan Zhenqing's contention for seats, the full text of Huai Ren's collection of Wang Youjun's calligraphy Heart Sutra, Zhu Zhishan's calligraphy of Du Fu's Eight Autumn Exhortations, Su Dongpo's Treatise on Health Preservation, the Former and Latter Chibi Fu, and the calligraphy of Emperor Taizong of Tang, Wang Youjun, Wang Xianzhi, and Huang Shangu are all vividly carved and can be called masterpieces. I heard from Hanhou that he has liked carving bamboo since he was twenty years old. At first, he still felt it was difficult, and he always felt inconvenient when playing the knife. After careful study, he suddenly felt refreshed. And he can do whatever he wants without any obstacles. For example, when carving a fan, he only needs to mark the number of lines on the fan bone with ink, and then he can play the knife and get what he wants. Qingshan Nong praised it as a divine art, which is indeed appropriate. The smallest words cannot be distinguished by eyesight. You must observe them with a microscope to see them all. I asked if his eyesight was damaged. According to him, his eyesight is better. This is really amazing. Hanhou is only thirty years old, and what he has achieved is already amazing. How can the rapid progress he will make in the future be limited?</p>
<h3>Travels in India (Sixty-Six)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the morning of the 28th, many young students came and were willing to teach me Hindi. They also wanted to learn Chinese. The children's smiles were lovely. Their intentions were very sincere. Their English was still struggling. I was very moved. Principal Nalun Misha wished that I would live in Benares and not return to China. How much the Indians love the Chinese. The Principal does not harm birds. I live in this room. The doors and windows are wide open. Sometimes the food is placed on the table, and the birds come first. I also do not feel annoyed. I heard that in Tibet, when people die, they are abandoned in the wild for birds and beasts to eat. Think about it, the human body still has a day when it is eaten by birds. How about rice grains? Wonderful. Indians can live in groups with birds and beasts. There are no meat eaters in Indian schools. All are vegetarians. It is said that if there are those who do not eat vegetarian food, they are excluded from the school. According to reports, Indians are strong and great in body. This proves that eating meat is just a habit and superstition. In fact, it is of no benefit to life. I have written many health books. I have been a vegetarian for seventeen years since my mother died. My spirit is more than that of ordinary people. This is enough to prove it.</p>
<p>On this day, four classes of students from the Indian school held a graduation ceremony. I was invited to attend and give a speech. The time was very long. From 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. I only attended at 12:00, which already felt too long. Music was interspersed in the middle. One person played the drums. One person sang and sang with a small harmonium. I do not know what the words were. The students all laughed. Art was also added in the middle. It was the breathing technique of those who practiced inner work. China and Japan both imitate this meditation. India is the true ancestral master. A woman playing the piano is drawn on the students' diplomas. It is said that she is the goddess of art. The students received their diplomas and performed a ritual of touching the feet and then touching their own heads to the Principal and the teachers. It is a simplified version of the foot-touching ritual mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. It is reminiscent of ancient customs. It is not like the school spirit of China, which emphasizes equality. After receiving their diplomas, the students also transferred various souvenirs to the school teachers. There were mirrors, portraits of famous people, etc. They were all placed on the altar. Flower wreaths were also hung on the necks of the teachers. Students wore wreaths when receiving their diplomas. The Principal personally put them on. The teachers and students were courteous to each other. It makes people think that there is no country in the world that respects teachers as much as India. Because I have given several speeches here, I was also given a flower wreath. The wreath was made of flowers. There are flowers everywhere in India. The rituals of burning incense, scattering flowers, and applying fragrance were also performed. The incense burner placed incense in a copper plate and walked around in front of everyone. The flower scatterer scattered flower petals. The fragrance applier applied fragrant oil to everyone's foreheads. There are colors. Students applied red. Teachers applied yellow. When I came here, I realized what the Buddhist scriptures said. Everything was confirmed. Several of the top students gave speeches. My speech was about the relationship between Chinese and Indian culture. Although Chinese Buddhism cannot create its own, it is good at developing it. Although Indian Buddhism is extinct, it relies on China to promote it in East Asia and the world. The meeting was dismissed at 4:00 PM and photos were taken.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Novel</p>
<h3>？？？(30)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>At this time, Ziliang had already returned to the room and was listening to his wife's reprimand. His wife also sat up and continued her words:</p>
<p>"Do you think I was asleep when I closed my eyes? I was testing your heart: I didn't expect you to abandon me and go to the back. You are so heartless! If I died today, you should be by the corpse's side until dawn, let alone that I am not dead!"</p>
<p>At this time, Ziliang finally came up with a defense:</p>
<p>"I didn't go anywhere, because I heard the maid in the kitchen washing the pot very loudly, and I was afraid of waking you up, so I planned to go downstairs and tell her."</p>
<p>"If that's the case, you have good intentions!"</p>
<p>Ziliang nodded.</p>
<p>"Good intentions are fine."</p>
<p>She paused, and Ziliang felt like a prisoner who had been pardoned, and he was relieved at once.</p>
<p>"However, you are still too negligent. I am sleeping in bed, how can you walk away?"</p>
<p>Ziliang's heart jumped again.</p>
<p>"I want to punish you!"</p>
<p>Just saying "punish," I don't know what she will punish him with. Ziliang will always be able to do it as long as he doesn't lose face in front of everyone.</p>
<p>"When I closed my eyes just now, I felt there were bedbugs under the pillow on this bed. Catch them for me!"</p>
<p>After saying that, she got out of bed.</p>
<p>"Catch bedbugs? I can't."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Bar: Initial Rise Followed by Decline</h3>
<p>▲ Result: Up One Taël and a Half</p>
<p>▲ Market Hesitation: Yesterday, the 22nd, the gold bar market rose and then fell, the situation uncertain. However, the volume was not large. From morning to evening, there were only nine taëls worth of transactions. Ultimately, it rose slightly by just over one taël. It seemed the silver market had indeed contracted, immediately opening with a high price. Sentiment was very good, but soon after, it crashed to outside 754 taëls. Unexpectedly, foreign exchange tightened slightly, and banks consistently offered sales. The surface trading was particularly sensitive and active, making it difficult for the price to hold for long. Suddenly, the 50-taël mark was broken, with only 3 taëls worth of fluctuations. The market continued to weaken, dropping another two taëls, finally settling between 46 taëls. It is predicted that large bars will rebound this morning. Yesterday happened to be Wednesday, with a quiet foreign exchange market, resulting in lackluster trading in the market.</p>
<p>▲ Sharp Initial Rise: The opening price for September in the morning sharply rose by 6 mace and 8 candareens, reaching 751.5 taëls. Large bars fell by one-eighth. Public and private telegrams quoted silver prices as rising by a quarter. The night before, the prediction was only a fall of one-eighth, so the opening price immediately surged past 50 taëls. Although the Citibank stock market rose, British and American exchange rates continued to fall, having no impact. Subsequently, due to purchases by Zelifeng, Yongwanxing, Shunli, etc., the price rose another three taëls, reaching 54.5 taëls. Shortly after, Yuanmaoyong, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Dacheng, and Wupin collectively sold off. It was rumored that Mr. Wu also sold, immediately causing the price to fall. Because British gold was not very strong, British and Japanese banks were willing to sell. The September price was about 125. At around 9:20, it fell to 5.05 taëls. The opening price for British gold remained the same, but only Donghui reduced by 25. At that time, it fell from 51.2 taëls to 49.8 taëls. Cuichangyong, Tongtaichang, etc., bought in, pushing it up again by just over one taël, reaching 51.2 taëls at 9:45. In a short while, it gradually fell by two taëls, and then depreciated by another taël at around 10:10. Then, Qianchangxiang, Fuyuanheng arbitraged and Wanxing, Shunli, etc., all sold. In short, British gold tended to ease. A Japanese bank sold 1875, reaching 48.2 taëls around 11:00. After a little over ten minutes, it rebounded by two taëls, due to retail investors coming in, reaching 50.05 taëls. Afterwards, in a complex state, it fluctuated around 50 taëls. Zelifeng, Fuchangyuanheng, etc., all sold, and since British gold could still be settled at 1875, the closing price at noon was 48.2 taëls, followed by within 8 taëls. Suddenly, news came that the Indian exchange rate had fallen by four annas, instantly causing a crash to over 50 taëls, then Wupin came out to sell, suppressing it to around 89 taëls. The market was unusually active, and the quoted price changed to 791.4 taëls, calculated to have been suppressed to between 40 and 42.3 taëls.</p>
<p>▲ Market Weakness: The after-market opened at 48.5 taëls, then 48.8 taëls. Retail investors sold, resulting in 46.6 taëls. It then rose by 7 or 8 candareens. Later, because the Indian exchange rate rebounded greatly, and there were consistently sell positions on the surface, two taëls were shaved off in just ten minutes, reaching 45.5 taëls. Before long, Bingxing scrambled to buy, and at 2:30, it was back at 47.5 taëls. Afterwards, the market was mediocre, with no special highs or lows, and it happened to be Wednesday, with no foreign exchange market. However, sentiment turned downwards, making it difficult to brighten the market. The price hovered between 46 and 47 taëls. By the 4:30 closing, it was only 46.2 taëls, rising again to 46.55 or 46.56 taëls, which was 1.5 taëls higher than the previous day's listed price. According to the whole day's maximum of 54.5 taëls and minimum of 45.5 taëls, there was a difference of 9 taëls.</p>
<p>▲ Red Bars Still Soft: Wupin’s early market was 51.5 taëls, noon closing was 49 taëls, afternoon was 49 taëls, closing price was 46.5 taëls. The quoted price was 43 taëls to 45.6 taëls. Booked at 46 taëls to 48 taëls, replenishment was at 46 taëls. Afternoon was 43 taëls. Also, the current red bar spot price was still flat and soft, calculated to have increased by 11.5 mace. The Tianjin gang bought over 200 taëls from Yingfenghheng. Tongfenyong sold several hundred taëls to silver smelters, at the same price. The other gangs had limited appetite, fearing the price could not be sustained.</p>
<p>▲ Active Selling: Surface transactions by various firms, according to statistics, Tianxiang, Cuichangyong, Yuanmao, Futaiheng, Fuxingyuan, and Xiexingyong all bought. Wanxing, Yuancheng, Zelifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuda, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuanchengyong, and Mr. Wu all sold. Qianchangxiang, Dadacheng, Yuantai, Bingxing, Huiyuan, Dingchang, Longsheng, Yuanchun, Shunli, Tongtaichang, etc., sometimes bought and sometimes sold, in considerable numbers. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoshui, Bingxing, and Shunli all bought. Qianchangxiang, Yuanchun, Wanxing, Yuandayong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and Yifengyong saw bustling transactions. Taifenghcheng slightly sold. The Dalian gang collectively sold 1300-1400 bars and bought 800-900 bars. The Guangdong gang had few transactions.</p>
<p>▲ Half-Day Closure: Today (the 23rd) because of the Korean people's riots and the tragic massacre of overseas Chinese, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has decided that all businesses in this port will cease operations in the morning. Therefore, the Gold Exchange will also close for half a day in the morning, to mourn. It will resume normal business in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Shifts from Firm to Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the British and American silver markets fell, while exchange rates saw small fluctuations. The market was flat. As for the Shanghai market, there was no improvement. HSBC's listed prices, except for the Japanese exchange rate, which decreased by 25 (mainly due to the decline in the Japanese and American exchange rates), remained unchanged. It seems the silver price in the domestic market shifted from firm to loose, due to the trend of the gold market rising and then falling. At noon, compared to the day before, the British gold was slightly reduced by 0.0625, the American gold by 0.125, and the Japanese gold increased by 0.01. In the afternoon, due to Wednesday's lack of market activity, Chinese gold traders still settled slightly on the buying side, with about £100,000 in British gold. Banks still had strong selling intentions, with the arbitrage gap around 18 taels. If one were to sell shillings and buy silver bars, the arbitrage would be between 16 taels. Also, there were few American dollar transactions, and not many Japanese gold transactions either. The market became rotational.</p>

Meifeng offered Citibank forward contracts for September at $30.0625. Hefeng offered September contracts at the same price. The closing offer price was $30.0625, and the buying price was $30.075.</p>

Distant-term contracts also decreased by 0.125, to 12 pence, 0.9375. Spot supply is lacking. China first advanced and then retreated. The market is flat. After the closing, the market turned dull.

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Trend Increasingly Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no early market quotes for various government bond spot prices. The after-market only saw quotes for the troop reduction bonds. The futures market was also quiet. It is estimated that over 14,000,000 was traded in the early market. Due to the gloomy atmosphere surrounding all bonds, major buyers and sellers were watching. Bond prices also appeared increasingly stagnant compared to the day before. There was only a fluctuation of 0.5 yuan in the front and after-markets. The only result was that the 20-year customs tax bond rose by about 1 yuan. The 19-year customs and troop reduction August contracts were also better by 7 to 8 jiao. Others only rose by about 3 to 4 jiao. Looking at the bond market situation, it is unlikely that there will be major increases or decreases in the short term.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Chinese Yarn Experiences Smooth Sales</h3>
<p>▲ Tomorrow, Yarn and Cloth Market Open for Half a Day</p>
<p>The yarn market remains flat, with no signs of revitalization. However, the overall trend is unusually stable, as the patriotic movement is becoming increasingly intense. Places like Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already inspected inferior goods and are not allowing them to pass through, creating a heated situation. Therefore, the sales of yarn from our factory have suddenly shown a thriving trend. The shipment of fine yarn is too small and insufficient to meet demand, so prices have only risen and not fallen. However, the price of Japanese goods is more sluggish, seemingly already affected. Due to slow sales of coarse yarn, large firms are selling off futures yarn, making it difficult to raise prices for the time being. However, outsiders and retail investors see the boycott movement and are unanimously inclined to buy in and go long. Tomorrow morning, the market will be closed for half a day to mourn the overseas Chinese who died, and will resume normal trading in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Man-Made Standard (RMC) Falls and Rises Again: The early market for man-made standard yarn (RMC) at the exchange opened with a drop in outside cotton, making the market atmosphere even more sluggish. Each contract fell by 4, 5, or 7 qian. In the afternoon, news of good actual sales caused each month to rebound by 3, 5, 7, or 8 qian. A total of 32,800 bales were traded. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,300 bales, Changfeng 500 bales, Shenxin 750 bales, Yiyu 700 bales, and Dafeng 850 bales.</p>
<p>Rongxing bought 1,050 bales, Yida 850 bales, Tongxing 850 bales, and Shenchang 750 bales. The closing prices for the man-made standard (RMC) are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Becomes Increasingly Tight</h3>
<p>Although the American cotton market is weak, this cotton market is very tight. This is because the cold weather hinders the growth of new cotton. At the same time, there is a rumor that a portion of the cotton in Hankou was damaged by floods. Therefore, there is a shortage in Shanghai, and the gold price is firm. The price of Indian cotton is relatively high. New buyers are actively coming, and transactions are gradually becoming lively. However, there are also quite a few people selling off new cotton.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Standard (HMC) Continues to Rise by 4 Qian: The Hankou Standard (HMC) opened in the early market, with a drop of 1 or 2 qian due to the flat and sluggish American cotton market, making the market atmosphere softer. The market suddenly tightened in the afternoon, with particularly strong buying interest in the market. It was said that there was news of more heavy rain in Hankou, and each contract rose by 4 or 5 qian. A total of 109,200 dan were traded. It was found that Hengyi sold 3,900 dan, Tianlong 3,900 dan, Jinfeng 2,800 dan, Hengda 2,800 dan, Gongtai 2,500 dan, Changfeng 6,400 dan, Xincheng 3,200 dan, and Jifeng 2,800 dan.

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Turn Weak Again</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Southern Hedging: Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of significant buyers, combined with sales from the South and good harvest conditions. Futures contracts fell by 24 to 29 points, spot prices fell by 25 points. British cotton futures rose by 11 points, spot prices rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later softened due to profit-taking by long positions. Nagpur fell by 1 rupee, Oomra rose by 2.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (21st telegram).</p>

<h3>Grains: Riverbed Rice Market Moving Upward</h3>
<p>▲ New Gate: Yesterday, there were not many sources from various routes, as merchants suffered significant losses after the previous two days of massive price declines in this port. The initial route followed the downturn in the Shanghai market, but then turned firm due to inquiries from the 客帮, reducing the number of rice boats transporting to Shanghai. In the morning, the street trade was still good, and 苏常 thick japonica rice was the most active, with prices rising by nearly a 角. Early and late japonica rice arrived sparsely, and prices also increased by about a 角. 洋杜 glutinous rice sales were slightly tight, and glutinous rice sales were steady.</p>
<p>▲ South Head: Yesterday, there were still not many sources from various gangs. City and rural store sales were lively due to the morning drizzle and news of price increases in the Northern Market, causing sentiment to rise. As a result, fresh 料 thick japonica rice felt quite active. Seeing this situation, boat owners all resold, immediately raising prices by 1 or 2 角. Thin rice still arrived sporadically, and although Ning sales were sluggish, the street sales were quite high and closely linked, and the market price also increased by a 角. The market price was still healthy even though 洋杜 glutinous rice sales were not smooth, but it was still healthy because of the lack of goods. The 隂化 arrivals were sparse and the market was flat. 元元 was nimble and showed a stable trend.</p>
<h3>Italian Raw Silk Prices Fall by More Than 10 Lire</h3>
<p>After Italian raw silk entered the Milan market, European and American silk sales once showed upward momentum. Since entering the summer, however, the weather in ports such as New York and Marseille has been unusually hot, and silk weaving factories have stopped work. Coupled with the German economic panic, overseas silk sales have stagnated, and silk prices have fallen sharply. Double Extra Grade is only opening at 385 lire per kilo, Special Grade is 332 lire, and Superior Grade is 280 lire, each falling by more than 10 lire.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Silk Sales Face Difficulties</h3>
<p>Silk weaving factories in New York and other places are still on summer vacation, silk sales are stagnant, and telegrams have not yet turned to Shanghai. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson, and others imported 20 bales of 黄厂 warp silk, and Meade &amp; Company and others imported 20 bales of 黄组 warp silk. Prices remain stable.</p>
<h3>Needle-Like Eyebrow Green Tea Sees Brisk Sales in England</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market in this port, Jardine Matheson, a British firm, once again made large-scale purchases of needle-like eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Xiehe, Tianxiang, Yongxing, and other firms also scrambled to handle transactions, and trading was quite robust, with the market feeling firm. The markets for Precious Eyebrow tea remained sluggish. British and French firms still held price-suppression ideas, and Chinese tea merchants' firmness varied, making it difficult to stabilize the market. Gongxi green tea, Russian firms have not yet scheduled their opening, and there are no major sales for Baitaichuang tea, making it difficult to be optimistic about the overall trend.</p>
<h3>Flour: Inland Gang's Appetite Grows Stronger</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a bullish trend, with foreign wheat prices reporting that the near-term wheat in Chicago was up $0.05, and the rest were up about $0.02. The weather was also not stable, with intermittent showers. The mainland gangs became increasingly eager. Inevitable natural disasters led to enthusiastic purchasing by buyers. In each trade, the mainland gangs were buying in, and speculative buyers were also trying hard to get in. However, the Tianjin gang took the opportunity to sell because of the current situation. Otherwise, the increase would have been even more considerable. As a result, this month's contract was up 0.0075 compared to the day before, August's was up 0.005, September and October's were up 0.01, and November and December's were up 0.015. Also, on the 23rd, in memory of the overseas Chinese, the flour market was closed for the entire day.</p>
<h3>Distant-Term Wheat Sees Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw the early market remain bullish with foreign wheat prices. Sentiment was still stable for each month, but buyers were very quiet, and selling pressure was strong, showing a slightly sluggish market trend. By the afternoon opening, distant-term sentiment suddenly shook. This was because 7,000 tons of 四兩一錢半 Australian wheat for September and October shipment were confirmed, with 中华 factory accounting for 3,500 tons and a certain miscellaneous grain firm accounting for 3,500 tons. Once this was confirmed, they naturally sold to the market with all their might, so the distant-term decline was very sharp. Therefore, if the mainland gangs are ignorant of the foreign situation and purely based their decisions on the domestic background, there will ultimately be problems in the future. As a result, this month's and August and September's contracts were down slightly by $0.02, October's was down $0.06, and November and December's were down $0.05. The spot wheat market remained stable. Factory demand was neither too close nor too far. 3,850 bales of Yangzhou, Puzhen, Penglai, Zhoupu, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, Kunshan, Anting, Wusong, Huangdu, and Jiading wheat were opened and handled by factories such as Fuxin, Huafeng, Fufeng, and Xinda. Also, 70 bales of sample goods of Russian wheat have also opened, with a price of 3.8 taels.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Fresh Zhangzhou Dried Lychees Arrive</h3>
<p>The first batch of new 兰竹枝 and 乌叶枝 lychees produced in Zhangzhou were shipped on the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan wheel the day before yesterday. It is reported that there are a total of 888 boxes, of which hundreds of boxes are transferred to Hangzhou and other places. Each firm handles approximately 400 boxes themselves, and company goods account for less than 400 boxes. Samples were seen yesterday, the color is good, and the texture is slightly soft, but compared to previous years, they are definitely dry. Approximately 200 pieces of various brand 兰竹枝 were immediately opened at $50 taels for the best grade, $40 taels for 高乌叶, and the next best grades were reduced by $1-3 taels, market atmosphere was flat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dumping of Medium Grade White Sugar, Market Flat</h3>
<p>▲ Taikoo Sugar Sales Quite Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram reported that the price of Cuban spot sugar rose by 0.03125, and the price of New York sugar futures rose by 0.02 for September, December, and May of next year. However, the price for March rose by 0.04. There was no change in the price of Java spot futures sugar. The Guild's registered 24th grade coarse-grained white sugar for Dutch sugar saw sluggish buying. Bids opened at $11.6 taels, but there were few inquiries. The transaction volume of medium-grained white sugar at $11 taels was also sparse, with the market being flat and weak. The transaction price for Taikoo Auto Sugar registered B mark was $12.1 taels, CW mark was $11.95 taels, DY mark was $11.8 taels, HX mark was $11.75 taels, and HM mark was $11.3 taels to $11.35 taels, showing an upward trend. The number of registered sales was very sparse. Jardine Matheson opened sales of 200 tons of 20th grade medium-grained white sugar for August shipment at a price of 5.5 Dutch guilders, with traders showing little buying interest, and was unable to sell them all at once.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Sheet Arrives Again, 500 to 600 Dan</h3>
<p>Five to six hundred dan of black iron sheet arrived again yesterday, so the market price was slightly cheaper. 3' x 6' sheets were sold for $9.5 taels and 2' x 6' sheets were sold for $11.5 taels. Transactions were sluggish due to 客帮 discontinuing their purchases.</p>
<h3>Factory Nails Drop in Price Due to Promotion of Sales</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been very quiet recently, so the entire market sees scattered transactions. However, the price of factory nails was dropped by $0.02 due to the boycott of Eastern goods, in order to promote sales. It is estimated that each barrel costs $7.2 taels, as well as $7 taels. It is expected that there will definitely be hope for future trading development.</p>

As a rule, other industries stop work on memorial days, but these industries are always an exception. In order to maintain traffic in the city, they must not stop work this morning.

<p>▲Detaining Japanese Goods The Anti-Japanese Association received a tip-off yesterday afternoon that a large batch of Japanese goods, more than 140 tons, including cotton yarn, eastern sugar, and seafood, was at the South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.

The association sent a letter to the Railway Bureau and the South Station, requesting that the goods be detained immediately and not allowed to be shipped out of Shanghai. The goods have now been seized and are awaiting disposal.</p>
<p>▲Start Registration The Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee of Shanghai announced the fifth order, starting the registration of Japanese goods.

<p>▲Customs Declaration Refusal The Shanghai Customs Brokers Union held an emergency meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss ways to boycott Japanese goods. It was resolved to immediately notify all members to clear procedures and prepare to refuse Japanese goods. In addition, the Customs Brokers Union, in order to voluntarily refuse to load Japanese goods, is said to have scheduled a members' meeting on the 25th to discuss the measures.</p>
<p>▲City Federation Letter The City Federation issued an emergency notice to members regarding the anti-Japanese aid overseas Chinese matter, stating: "Regarding the emergency notice, Japan's bullying of China has been a constant occurrence since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Recent examples include the forced Twenty-One Demands on May 9th, the massacre of Chinese citizens on May 30th, and the massacre of Jinan soldiers and civilians and diplomatic officials on May 3rd. Now, they have instigated the Korean people to massacre thousands of overseas Chinese, causing tens of millions in property damage. Such barbarity is resented by both gods and men and is intolerable to heaven and earth. How can we endure this? How can we remain silent in the face of this crisis of survival? In the past incidents of May 9th, May 30th, and May 3rd, we all resisted Japanese goods, bravely advanced, united as a nation, endured hardship, and shared the same hatred. The sacrifices were not small, but the results were like bubbles, and some even took the opportunity to advance their careers and get rich, losing their minds. As a result, we were ridiculed by the Japanese, who said that our enthusiasm was only five minutes. Hearing this mockery, our hearts are cut like knives. We cannot but be ashamed of the past. Now we are again engaging in economic severance with Japan. This term has been used many times. If we do not act with strength, how can we avoid the shame of the past? Members of our association, living under the iron heels of imperialists, have suffered hardships and have a clearer understanding. We must all resolutely and thoroughly resist Japanese goods and not be tempted by temporary profits, lest we bring shame upon ourselves and our country. This is a special emergency notice. We hope that all will swear to thoroughly resist Japan in order to uphold our nation and save our country. We deeply pray for this. The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation."</p>

<h3>Various Circles in the Three Districts Send Telegrams to Comfort Anti-Bandit Soldiers</h3>
<p>▲Anti-Bandit Propaganda Conference Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd) at 10:00 AM, the Party Headquarters of the Three Districts of this city convened various circles to hold an anti-bandit propaganda conference in the auditorium of the Party Headquarters of the Three Districts in the Temple of the Queen of Heaven. Representatives from the Dyeing Industry Union of the Three Districts, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association, the First Elementary School, the Public School of the Party Headquarters of the Three Districts, the Shuji Elementary School, Jiangnan College, the Wool Carding Trade Association, the Duck Slaughtering Operation Union, the Sand and Stone Industry Association, the Coal and Stone Barge Transportation Union, the Water and Electricity Industry Union of the Six Districts, the Education Association of the Three Districts, the Candy and Canned Food Industry Association, the Letterpress Printing Industry Association, and various branches, totaling about 300 people, were present. Sun Mingqi presided over the meeting. After the chairman reported on the significance of the meeting, Zhu Yingpeng, Tao Baichuan, and others gave speeches. Subsequently, a representative temporarily moved to send telegrams to comfort the anti-bandit soldiers, which was unanimously passed. The meeting then adjourned. The gist of the speeches is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲Summary of Speeches Zhu Yingpeng's speech briefly stated that there was originally no Communist Party in China ten years ago. After the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang in the Republic of China in 1924, the Communist Party took the opportunity to invade and steal party power. During this period, Russia established the Soviet government. Russia, which claims to be a revolutionary country of the proletariat, is actually a red imperialist. Many small countries that were previously annexed by Russia appear to be independent from the Russian Empire on the surface, but in fact they are still subordinate to it and have no political power. We can see the conspiracy of its means by looking at the Russian constitution. (1) The army cannot be organized by itself and must be organized by the Soviet government. (2) The financial budget cannot be decided by itself and must be decided by the Soviet Federation. (3) Diplomacy cannot be handled independently and must be decided by the Soviet Federation government. The ambition of this situation is obvious. The Chinese Communist Party is a running dog of Russia. How dangerous it would be if it were to steal political power. This time, the National Government is suppressing the rampant Red bandits in Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places, who are killing, setting fires, raping, and looting everywhere. This is truly work to save the people and the country. We want peace in China and a prosperous life for the people, so the Red bandits must be exterminated. I hope that the comrades and compatriots who are present today will take on the responsibility of oral propaganda and tell everyone about the disasters and dangers of these Red bandits. Following that, Tao Baichuan, a member of the executive committee of the City Party Headquarters, gave a speech, briefly stating that Mr. Zhu had already explained the significance of suppressing bandits and all the circumstances of Soviet Russia very clearly. The Communist Party often says outside that if China unites with Soviet Russia, it can receive equal treatment. Mr. Zhu just used the inequality of the Soviet Russian constitution as proof. I believe that there is now a very important key, that is, whether China will be annexed by Soviet Russia or whether it will work hard to exist on its own. We know that Japan invades China with the power of the Japanese, while Russia not only invades China with the power of the Russians, but also uses the Chinese themselves to invade China. This is the most terrible thing, because they use the general farmers and workers on one hand, and on the other hand, in Outer Mongolia and Southern Manchuria in our country, they allow young people to join the Communist Party, gather rogues, and organize the Red Army (Red bandits) to make trouble everywhere in our country, so that Chinese society cannot be peaceful and the people cannot live in peace. At the same time, they send troops to Manchuria and Mongolia to carry out aggression. This method of internal and external attacks is much more dangerous than Japan. Therefore, to save the country and save the people, we must support the National Government's suppression of the Red bandits. Now, the places with the most Red bandits are Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces. In the past year, more than 300,000 people in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces were killed by the Red bandits, more than 2 million were displaced and unable to return home, and more than 3 million houses were burned down. Jiangxi is the place with the most rice production, and more than 50 million dan of rice were burned by the Red bandits. The property lost due to the Red bandits in the two provinces is 100 million. If they are ravaged by the Red bandits for another two years, the future of China will be very dangerous. We must save the country by first suppressing the Red bandits. On the one hand, because of suppressing the Red bandits, we will not be afraid of being annexed by Soviet Russia. On the other hand, we can save the lives of the people. We are all patriotic and should rise up and unite to promote the truth. Younger children can give speeches to their fathers and brothers about the crimes of the Red bandits, so that the Red bandits will be eliminated in a matter of days. After Tao's speech, representatives Fan Gengxin and others gave successive speeches, the length of which is omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>▲Conference Telegram After the speeches were completed, Yu Zeren and Fan Gengxin, representatives of the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, temporarily proposed that a telegram be sent in the name of the conference to comfort the generals at the front who are suppressing the bandits, which was unanimously passed.</p>
<h3>Sino-Chilean Commercial Treaty to Be Handled in China</h3>
<p>▲Embassy to Be Established in Beijing, Temporary Office to Be Set Up in Shanghai</p>
<p>▲Many Overseas Chinese in Chile, Relations with That Country Are Still Harmonious</p>
<p>▲Our Authorities Currently Intend to Conduct Sino-Chilean Shipping Route</p>
<p>The newly appointed Chilean Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Bascuñán, recently arrived in Shanghai with his wife upon the orders of his government. After paying respects to our Minister of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, he has now returned to Shanghai from Beijing. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed him at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on the Bund yesterday. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲New Sino-Chilean Treaty It has now been decided to handle the new Sino-Chilean treaty in China. I came to China this time specifically for this matter. The contents of the treaty are divided into commerce and friendship. It was previously handled by the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to Chile, Mr. Zhang, in Santiago, but had not reached the signing stage. After that, I will continue to handle it with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>▲Establishing an Embassy The Chilean government intends to select a suitable location in Nanjing to build a new embassy. I have already made contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during my visit to Beijing this time. However, due to the selection of the location and the construction time, it cannot be realized in a short time. Therefore, for this transition period, it is planned to set up a temporary agency in Shanghai to facilitate communication with the outside world at any time. However, I still need to telegraph the government for instructions before making a decision.</p>
<p>▲Overseas Chinese in Chile Although I don't know exactly how many overseas Chinese are in Chile, there are quite a few. Most of them are mainly engaged in business or industrial enterprises and are very wealthy. They are all amiable and approachable, so the people of China and Chile have very harmonious and close relations. Mr. Zhang was also very welcomed by all sectors of our country in Chile. During my visit to Beijing this time, Minister Wang also told me that he plans to establish a Sino-Chilean shipping route to make the commerce between the two countries more developed. In this way, I firmly believe that the relations between China and Chile will be even closer.</p>
<p>▲Impressions of China Before I came to China, I had long heard that China is an ancient country with a highly civilized and long history. After arriving in China, I realized that this statement is still not false. In addition to admiring China's civilization and the development of all industries, I am also very grateful for the kind hospitality of the Chinese government, Minister Wang, and all sectors of society.</p>
<p>▲Also a Reporter Mr. Bascuñán finally said that he was also a journalist more than ten years ago and felt quite interested in the journalistic career. After leaving the journalistic career, he entered the diplomatic field and has been in it for thirteen or fourteen years. He served as a Chilean diplomat in Poland for several years.</p>
<h3>Customs Brokers Request the Suppression of Foreign Merchants</h3>
<p>▲Because No Country Allows Foreigners to Establish Customs Brokerages</p>
<p>▲To Prevent Japanese Merchants from Speculating During Patriotic Movements</p>
<p>The customs brokers in this city are concerned about the trend of foreign merchants gradually monopolizing the customs brokerage industry in our country. Whenever Chinese merchants engage in patriotic movements and boycott Japanese goods, foreign merchant customs brokerages often seize this opportunity to undertake loading and shipping, so it is actually no different from not stopping loading. This only causes intangible losses to Chinese merchants. Moreover, no country allows the establishment of foreign merchant customs brokerages. In the past, the government strictly suppressed foreign merchants from paying taxes on behalf of customers. However, this is not the case in the tax country. There are more than 800 Chinese merchant customs brokerages in this city, including Yuanfeng, China Merchants Yu, etc. There are more than 30 Japanese merchant customs brokerages, including Higuchi, Yamaguchi, and Masuki. There are four British merchant customs brokerages, including Hengmao and Maotai. Japanese merchants account for three-tenths of the total business in the city. Before the May 9th National Humiliation Day occurred, there were only one or two foreign merchant customs brokerages in China, which only declared and loaded goods for foreigners. Since May 9th, when the Chinese people rose up to boycott Japanese goods, Chinese merchant customs brokerages unanimously refused to load them. Japanese merchants took the opportunity to set up their own customs brokerages. At that time, the Jianghai Customs did not prohibit it, resulting in great losses for Chinese merchants. When May 3rd and May 30th occurred, Chinese merchant customs brokerages also refused to load Japanese goods, and the result was still the same. To this day, the influence of Japanese customs brokerages is already deep. The goods of merchants from Dalian, Niuzhuang, and other places are now taken away by Japanese merchant customs brokerages. Japanese merchant customs brokerages intend to lower prices. For example, for one piece of cotton yarn, the Chinese merchant customs brokerage price is 2.3 taels, while the Japanese merchant price is 1.6 taels. If this continues, without quickly devising fundamental countermeasures, Chinese merchant customs brokerage will decline due to patriotic movements. Therefore, in addition to planning to send representatives to the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office to petition within the next few days, the industry has also prepared a petition to the City Party Headquarters and the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting that they forward a letter to the Jianghai Customs to suppress foreign merchant customs brokerages in order to maintain commerce and protect national rights.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies by Telegram to Suspend the Collection of Goods Production and Sales Tax on Cotton</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Federation previously received a letter from the Tianjin Cotton Mill Association stating that the goods production and sales tax on cotton had not been completely abolished and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to stop it. According to a reply from the Ministry of Finance, it was claimed that the He</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The ministry replied by telegram: "It is claimed that Hebei Province has included cotton in the items subject to the goods production and sales tax. Please order that cotton no longer be taxed repeatedly." It should be approved to order the special financial commissioner of Hebei to investigate and suspend the collection. In addition to ordering the special financial commissioner of Hebei to comply, this reply is for your information.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of Guangdong Compatriots Raising Relief for Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>This time, torrential floods occurred in the East, West, and North Rivers of Guangdong, causing a major disaster. Yesterday, the United Guangdong Chamber of Commerce in this city received a telegram from Guangzhou Convenient Hospital stating that Chen Bingqian, Cai Chang, and Jian of Shanghai Daxin Company, regarding the North River flood disaster in Lian, Ying, Qing, Si, San, Nan, and Hua counties, had caused over a hundred breached embankments and widespread suffering among the people, more tragic than in the year of Yimao. The provincial capital and cities were slightly less affected. Our hospital initiated an emergency relief effort on the 4th, and by the 14th, united with various sectors to establish the Guangdong Flood Relief Association. Respectfully, Chen Huipu of Guangzhou Convenient Hospital. Furthermore, a telegram from the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong stated, "To the United Guangdong Chamber of Commerce, your telegram received. The Guangdong flood disaster is severe, the affected area is vast, and the cries of the suffering are everywhere, urgently awaiting relief. We have repeatedly organized emergency relief efforts, led by our hospital and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Please raise funds for relief to save the survivors." From Xiao of the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, etc. At that time, the chairman of the association, Chen Bingqian, happened to be in Mogan Mountain. Upon receiving the telegram, he rushed back and immediately convened a meeting of fellow townsmen to initiate a fundraising association. In addition to the association advancing a large sum of money to Guangdong for emergency relief, Chen Bingqian also donated 5,000 yuan. Donation booklets have been printed and distributed to various sectors. Furthermore, the Shanghai Guangdong merchants' miscellaneous grain industry Shenshoutang, import and export industry Yuanantang, sugar and grocery industry Guangantang, leather industry Shenantang, cotton yarn industry Mianantang, silk and cloth industry association, and major companies are conducting fundraising efforts separately, which is extremely enthusiastic. It was also resolved by the public to designate the Guangdong Bank, Guohua Bank, Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun companies in this city as agencies for receiving relief funds.</p>
<p>The Guangzhao Public Association received a telegram from Lu Jingke and Chen Huipu yesterday, appealing for relief. "To Chen Bingqian and Cai Chang of Daxin Company, forwarded to the Guangzhao Public Association, Guangdong Merchants' Hospital, China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, General Chamber of Commerce, and newspaper offices: This flood disaster, originating from a mountain collapse in Lianzhou, has cascaded downstream, with a vast area and deep disaster. Our hospital initiated an emergency relief effort on the 4th, and efforts have continued until the 14th, uniting with various sectors to establish a relief association. We appeal for assistance in raising relief funds." Respectfully, Lu Jingke and Chen Huipu of Convenient Hospital.</p>
<h3>The Donggang Steamer is Still Not Out of Danger</h3>
<p>▲Passengers Carried from Vientiane to Fujian</p>
<p>▲Shanghai Shipowners' Rescue Measures</p>
<p>The Donggang steamer of the Donggang Company, which encountered an accident near the Sibaiyida Island lighthouse off the coast of Fuzhou, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the reporter went to the shipowner Mr. Zhao's residence to inquire about the details of the incident and the current situation, which are further described below.</p>
<p>▲Main Cause of the Accident: The Donggang steamer was recently rented out by the shipowner Mr. Zhao to the Yadong Company in this city, operating along the Shanghai-Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou route. Last Saturday, the steamer departed from Shanghai to Fujian with cargo. Approximately forty passengers disembarked in Shanghai. According to the schedule, it should have arrived in Quanzhou on the morning of the 21st. However, when it reached the waters off Sibaiyida Island, near Shuangfeng, the steam engine in the engine room suddenly exploded, and the boiler was also damaged. Furthermore, the hull in the middle cabin was cracked, and the machinery was completely damaged, rendering it unable to move. Seawater rushed into the ship. The shipmaster, Sun Quanshun, urgently sent out a distress signal. At four o'clock in the morning on the 20th, it was first spotted by the Japanese ship Lushanmaru. After repeated requests from shipmaster Sun, the Japanese ship only agreed to rescue the passengers on board and transport them to Xiamen. Therefore, Sun Quanshun immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai, stating, "The Donggang steamer encountered an accident near the lighthouse with a ruptured boiler, taking in four feet of water. The engine room in the cabin is extremely dangerous, and the ship may sink. All passengers have been rescued by the Japanese ship. Currently, we are entrusting the ship to tow it, and negotiations are underway."</p>
<p>▲Vientiane Provides Assistance: After the Donggang steamer encountered the accident, in order to ensure the safety of the passengers, it was agreed with the Japanese ship to first send the forty passengers onto the Japanese ship. Then, shipmaster Sun Quanshun requested the Lushanmaru to tow the Donggang steamer to the nearby Huyang Bay beach. However, the Japanese ship firmly refused. Until yesterday, a telegram reported that the Donggang had already been flooded and that towing was impossible. Fortunately, the Sanbei Company's Vientiane steamer, en route from Shanghai to Fujian, heard the alarm and went to rescue. When the Vientiane arrived, the Donggang had already taken in a lot of water and could not be towed further. Therefore, it sent a telegram to Shanghai, requesting the Shanghai shipowners to quickly dispatch tugboats for rescue.</p>
<p>▲Passengers Rescued to Fujian: The forty passengers rescued by the Japanese ship, and after the arrival of the Vientiane steamer, all passengers requested the Vientiane steamer to rescue them to Fuzhou. The owner of the Vientiane steamer, Mr. Liu, immediately agreed and negotiated with the owner of the Lushanmaru. The Vientiane lowered a sampan to the side of the Japanese ship and transferred all the passengers to this ship. Originally intending to send them to Xiamen, it has now been changed to Fuzhou. Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram from Fujian stating that all those rescued have safely arrived in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>▲Ship Still Not Out of Danger: Mr. Zhao previously received a telegram from Fuzhou stating that the Donggang had been towed to Fuzhou. This telegram was very strange. The shipowner immediately sent a telegram to the shipmaster of the Donggang, Sun Quanshun, stating, "Your telegram received. By which ship was the ship towed and to where? What is the extent of the damage? Reply in detail." After this telegram was sent, there was no reply until late at night. Until six o'clock yesterday afternoon, the Dechang Company in this city received a telegram from Cai Dachang of Fuzhou, stating that according to passengers from the Vientiane (i.e., those rescued), the Donggang's steam pipe exploded, but it did not sink. However, there are no ships to rescue it, and it is feared that it will be looted. Rescue should be expedited. (The following is omitted.) Therefore, the Donggang is still in the sea area and has not yet escaped danger. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Zhao discussed rescue measures.</p>
<p>▲Request for Naval Protection: Based on the telegram, the shipowner, Mr. Zhao, sent a letter to the Naval Headquarters in this city last night, requesting that a warship be dispatched to the location of the Donggang accident to protect it, in order to prevent pirate looting. On the other hand, he also discussed hiring barges to tow it for rescue and to repair the damaged areas. Yesterday, the Huaan Insurance Company, which insured the ship, sent a letter to the shipowner, inquiring about rescue measures. It is understood that the Donggang steamer has a deadweight of 1,000 tons. It originally operated in Xiangshan and was originally named Deli, but later changed to its current name. Later, as business on this route was not good, the ship was rented out to others and rerouted to Xinghua and Quanzhou, with a monthly rent of 5,500 yuan. The hull is worth 100,000 yuan, but the water insurance is not fully covered.</p>
<h3>Yongxing Steamer Collides with Chuyou Warship</h3>
<p>▲Negotiations for Compensation Underway</p>
<p>The Ningshao Company's Yongxing steamer, on the afternoon of the 18th, while traveling from Jiujiang to Hankou, collided with the Chuyou warship anchored there. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Circumstances of the Collision: The Ningshao Company's Yongxing steamer, at 8:40 p.m. on the afternoon of the 18th, set sail from Jiujiang to Hankou. Just as the ship's ropes were untied, Staff Officer Zhang of the Air Force ordered the ship to temporarily delay its departure. Therefore, it leaned against the dock again. Unexpectedly, the river water was turbulent, and the stern of the Yongxing suddenly touched a pontoon boat while untying the ropes, causing the front of the ship to be shaken and suddenly crashed into the warship Chuyou of the Navy, which was advancing on the river surface. The owner of the Yongxing ship, Wu Hougui, urgently tried to avoid it by operating the machinery, but it was too late.</p>
<p>▲Damage to the Warship: This collision was caused by the Yongxing steamer's starboard side striking the Chuyou warship's port side. The Chuyou was unable to avoid it due to being anchored, resulting in serious damage. At the time, the hull was about to tilt to the right. A total of one No. 3 sampan was destroyed, the warship's foremast awning support was broken, the support base was bent and damaged, the awning canvas was completely torn, the port iron chain was destroyed and broken, the medical officer's cabin on the deck was smashed, the warship's warning red light was also knocked off, the naval uniform locker was destroyed, the port water hammer disc and frame were knocked off, and the boom was also broken.</p>
<p>▲Joint Inspection: After the accident, the owner of the Yongxing ship, Wu Hougui, together with Mao Fengzhang, the Jiujiang branch director of Ningshao, went to the Chuyou warship and inspected it with the captain, listing all the damaged areas. Fortunately, no one was injured. Shipowner Wu expressed his apologies to the captain of the Chuyou and promised to be responsible for full compensation. After the inspection, the captain of the Chuyou dispatched his adjutant, Peng Zuxuan, to the Ningshao Company to negotiate the compensation issue.</p>
<p>▲Aftermath Measures: The Yongxing steamer itself also suffered considerable damage to its second-floor deck due to the huge reactive force, but it did not affect its navigation and continued to Hankou as usual. The Chuyou has reported this matter to the Naval Headquarters and is contacting Ningshao in this city to discuss repairs and compensation. The captain of the Yongxing has also reported the details of the incident to Shanghai, stating that the accident was caused by being ordered to stop sailing after already having departed. Yesterday, the company reported this matter to the General Headquarters and replied to the Naval Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Zhao Tieqiao's Death Anniversary to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲Simultaneously Holding a Bronze Statue Unveiling Ceremony</p>

<h3>The Matter of Leniently Admitting Female Postal Workers</h3>
<p>▲Suspicion and Explanation</p>
<p>▲Petition from the Postal Workers' Union: The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, regarding the matter of leniently admitting female postal workers, submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications, stating: "Petition for instructions on leniently admitting female postal workers, requesting your consideration and instructions. Upon investigation, the Ministry's instructions to the Directorate General of Posts on June 25th stated (the text of the order was recorded in yesterday's newspaper and is omitted). Upon careful examination of the current document, it actually has a strong bias in favor of women over men, which is greatly contrary to the principle of gender equality. It is understood that the postal bureau's examination for male and female postal workers began last year. Prior to that, there were rumors that female employees would receive lower salaries and grades than men in order to save public funds. Subsequently, the union, based on the principle of gender equality, uniformly relied on examination results for recruitment and treatment, and listed practical measures regarding maternity leave and favorable regulations for female transfers, and suggested that the Directorate General of Posts submit them to the Ministry for approval and implementation. This fully demonstrates the union's sincere respect for the spirit of gender equality, its efforts to seek welfare for female colleagues, its efforts to eliminate gender barriers in society, and its efforts to resolve disputes over gender divisions in the postal service. I am pleased that the new system has just been implemented and the grand plan is gradually unfolding. Unexpectedly, this time, the recruitment of postal workers in Shanghai, Fujian, and other regions suddenly favors women over men. Is this in accordance with party guidelines? Examinations should naturally not be divided by gender and should take academic knowledge as the standard. How can one favor this and discriminate against that, going against the principle of equality? Upon careful examination of the order, it first states that there are many women with higher education, and then it states that women should be leniently admitted. The postal bureau's examination has always been based on selecting true talent. This is not only something that postal colleagues are confident in, but also something that the whole country agrees with. If the women who take the examination do have higher education, it will naturally be easy to be selected. Why is it necessary to be leniently admitted? Furthermore, various agencies have never had abnormal regulations for preferential recruitment of female employees. The Ministry has created this example, which those who know it will say is promoting women's employment, and those who criticize it will say is belittling women. It is truly something that the Ministry does not approve of. The union members are greatly puzzled, so they have submitted a special petition, requesting your consideration and a detailed explanation of the instructions for compliance, in order to dispel the doubts of the people. This is truly for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Communications, Wang, respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, July 23rd."</p>
<p>▲Secretary Yang's Remarks: A reporter from the Daily News inquired about this matter with Secretary Yang Ketian of the bureau yesterday. According to him, the wording of the order received from the Ministry of Communications this time seemed quite vague. The only thing that favors women is the statement that female candidates should be leniently admitted to show encouragement. However, in my (Yang's self-designation) opinion, the so-called lenient treatment of women actually means leniently admitting them in terms of physical examination. Because women are inherently insufficient, their physical strength is not as good as men's. Therefore, there is this order to make up for women's shortcomings. Judging by the principle of equality, there seems to be nothing wrong with it. As for academic knowledge in the examination, men and women are still equal and there is no division. I have heard that the Postal Workers' Union opposes this, saying that it does not conform to gender equality. I have always advocated recruiting more women to show the promotion of women's rights. This time, I thought that the so-called lenient admission in the Ministry of Communications' order was in terms of academic knowledge, so I expressed dissatisfaction. If I knew that this time the leniency was in terms of physical fitness and that the standard for academic knowledge in the examination was still equality, I think I would not object to it.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Request Exemption from Deck Tonnage Dues</h3>
<p>▲The Shipping Association Submitted a Document to the Ministry of Finance Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Petition for the additional levy of tonnage dues on goods loaded on decks, etc., which is of absolutely no benefit to preventing smuggling and ensuring security, and is cumbersome and repetitive, making it unbearable. We respectfully reiterate the facts and implore you to quickly withdraw your order, so as to avoid double taxation and maintain commercial shipping. Your association previously submitted a request to exempt the additional levy of tonnage dues on goods loaded on decks, etc., and received your approval, stating that the submission was noted. The additional levy of tonnage dues on goods loaded on decks was originally for the purpose of preventing smuggling and ensuring security, and was implemented with the approval of the Executive Yuan, making it difficult to change. If there are other difficulties, the association may directly negotiate with the customs on methods to facilitate shipping companies, while still adhering to the purpose of not violating the Executive Yuan's order, which should be complied with. Upon investigation, ships have a wider space, and it is difficult to avoid goods being carried without declaration by cargo vendors, crew members, and their subordinates. However, since it is smuggling, it is inevitable that the customs officers will search, the captains will investigate, and the inspectors will investigate. The goods are hidden and concealed. Even the most foolish person would never publicly place smuggled goods on the visible decks, etc., to await discovery. Therefore, the method of preventing smuggling by adding tonnage dues on goods loaded on decks, etc., is actually prescribing the wrong medicine and is ridiculed by smugglers. This is the first point. Upon investigation, the goods loaded on decks, etc., are either poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, etc., which are related to death, rot, and collapse, or cotton, rags, oil, etc., which are related to fire hazards and abandonment, or empty joints, empty cages, empty barrels, etc., which are related to avoiding pressure and facilitating unloading. All of these have special reasons why they cannot be loaded in cargo holds. Furthermore, the above-mentioned items occupy more space and weigh less, so loading on decks, etc., will never cause the upper part to be heavy and the lower part to be light, endangering safety. Even if encountering wind and waves along the way, they can be thrown into the sea immediately. The jettisoning of deck cargo is permitted by cargo passengers and is a common practice in the shipping industry. According to the shipping regulations of various countries, such goods are also excluded from general average. From this perspective, it has absolutely no impact on navigation safety. If it is said that adding tonnage dues on decks is intended to prohibit through taxation, so that goods loaded on decks, etc., will be moved to cargo holds in the future, the reasons are special and it is impossible to do so in reality. Therefore, this measure is also inconsistent with the topic and cannot achieve any results. This is the second point. Upon investigation, after the tonnage of each ship is determined by the customs, in order to prevent shipowners from greedily loading too much, a mark of the load line (commonly known as the insurance circle) is added on both sides of the ship's outer surface to indicate the limit. In this regard, the weight of each cargo that should be exposed on decks, etc., is actually included in the ship's rated tonnage. Since it is included in the rated tonnage, the tonnage dues have already been paid, and demanding additional payment is called double taxation. If the weight of the entire ship exceeds the load line due to the installation of cargo on decks, etc., then its export should be absolutely prohibited in order to rectify it and ensure safety. It is absolutely not allowed to voluntarily pay additional tonnage dues to be granted a violation. Otherwise, if the ship is within the limit of its load capacity, it will be required to pay additional tonnage dues per ton and per trip solely because of the different location of the cargo. This is seeking an exception outside the law. What's more, if each ship's cargo is insufficient for its rated tonnage each time, I know that the customs will definitely not agree to return the tonnage dues for the unused tonnage of cargo this time. If so, the method of receiving and giving is different. In terms of emotion, reason, affairs, and law, it is difficult to justify itself. This is the third point. To the extent that smuggling is enough to damage the income of shipowners, shipowners are doing everything they can to prevent it in order to protect their income. Therefore, they all hire many inspectors to detect or intercept on ships or in ports. Before departure and upon arrival of the ship, customs officers conduct searches, confiscate, and punish. Nothing is omitted. This is all the proper way to prevent smuggling, and it is what wealthy merchants are doing in practice. If the customs wants to seek a progressive method in order to stop smuggling, it can formulate a method that prescribes the right medicine. All shipowners will sincerely welcome and fully assist. Otherwise, this additional levy of tonnage dues on goods loaded on decks, etc., is of no benefit to preventing smuggling, is irrelevant to ensuring safety, and is a type of double taxation if the cargo is not over-limit. It is truly impossible for the shipping companies, which are extremely depressed, to reluctantly assume. In addition to complying with the approval to recommend representatives to meet with the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department to discuss everything and request him to forward it, we respectfully reiterate the facts and implore you to carefully examine them and quickly withdraw your order, so as to avoid double taxation and maintain commercial shipping. We urgently present our words and await your orders in fear. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Finance. The letter to the Tax Affairs Department is roughly the same and is omitted."</p>
<h3>The Daji Steamer Will Resume Service</h3>
<p>▲Renamed Dayu</p>
<p>The Dada Company's Shanghai-Yangtze River route steamer Daji, which exploded with sulfur on the Longjusha River off the coast of Tianshenggang on the evening of March 11, burning hundreds of people to death and completely destroying the ship's surface, etc., was reported in detail in previous newspapers. The hull of the ship was later retrieved to Shanghai by the company and repaired at the Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu. After more than four months, it is now heard that the ship's renovation is about to be completed and it will leave the factory in early next month, resuming service around mid-month. The former name of Daji has now been changed to Dayu. It is heard that the Daji steamer's losses this time are over 200,000.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Industrial Survey Extension Ends</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Survey, conducted by the State Council's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, and other five agencies, has been underway since May, with a period of three months until the end of this month. A total of 1,700 large and small factories have been surveyed. However, there are approximately 2,000 domestic factories in Shanghai, and there may still be omissions. Furthermore, the forms filled out by each factory often have conflicting figures, which will inevitably cause difficulties in compiling statistics in the future. Therefore, after reviewing the forms, about half of them still need to be reviewed and corrected before they can be compiled. Yesterday, representatives from various agencies held a meeting and decided to extend the aforementioned supplementary investigation and review period by another three months, which will not be completed until the end of October this year. However, there were previously sixteen investigators, and it is now proposed to reduce them by half.</p>
<h3>Accurate News of the Injured Pilot of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation</h3>
<p>▲Director of the Company, Li Jingzong, Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the Eurasia Aviation Corporation in this city, the Eurasia No. 2 aircraft and the pilot Lai Zhiji and pilot Kolbe, which were lost on the 2nd of this month in the Outer Mongolia area, the company had previously received an official telegram report, but it was not yet considered certain. Yesterday, the company's director Li Jingzong and the German deputy manager Schmid had already returned to Shanghai from Beiping to handle this matter. According to him, they did not have any suitable methods to think of in Beiping, so there was no contact. Only Vice Commander Zhang telegraphed the commander of the Northeast Army in Manzhouli, ordering people and cars to search and try to repair the Eurasia No. 1 aircraft, which was injured during the last risky private search for the missing No. 2 aircraft in Outer Mongolia. As for the three missing people, according to the information I have obtained, it is definitely known that pilot Kolbe suffered a leg injury, and the injury is not light. He is now definitely in a hospital in Bayantala. The driver Lai Zhiji was not injured and seems to still be trapped. This is because it is a commercial plane and I can't think of any danger. However, the repair of the Eurasia No. 1 aircraft is now completely repaired and can be used immediately.</p>
<h3>News of Concessions in the City Center Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲The Spirit of Service of the Shanghai Bank</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (21st) was the first time the municipal government started to allow citizens to purchase land in the city center. Because the location is suitable and prosperity is expected, the leaders were very crowded, so the district time was specially changed to a lottery method. As a result of the lottery, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank obtained more than twenty districts. However, it is heard that many people had entrusted the bank to bid on their behalf in advance. Therefore, as a result, in addition to each trustee obtaining a certain number of acres (approximately 40% of the total), everyone felt that they had not fully satisfied their wishes. The bank itself only obtained 40 acres. It is also heard that the bank's role in obtaining land is, on the one hand, to promote the prosperity of the city center, and on the other hand, to solve the housing difficulties of citizens. Therefore, it plans to build beautiful houses for sale on the land it has obtained, with separate deeds for each house, and the purchase price can be repaid in installments, and the price is also low. It is absolutely not for profit. However, the land currently obtained is limited and can only meet the needs of the bank's employees. Therefore, the bank authorities are willing to provide assistance with construction funds to anyone from any sector who has obtained the land in the same spirit. It is heard that they are currently drafting measures for construction loans.</p>
<h3>The Dispute Over the Resumption of Work by French Electric Factory Workers Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute over the resumption of work by the 27 workers who were suspended by the factory after the strike last year, the French-owned water and electricity factory workers' union dispatched more than ten representatives, including Lu Guanhong, Zhu Along, Zhang Amao, Dong Guixiang, Yin Changyu, and Chen Jinfa, to negotiate with the company's manager yesterday. Lu Guanhong and Zhang Renjun acted as translators. As a result of the negotiations, the company's manager officially replied, agreeing that all workers will enter the factory to work next Wednesday (i.e., the 29th). Their wages will be paid from tomorrow (23rd). All workers considered this satisfactory. It is also heard that Lu Guanhong, Zhang Renjun, Dong Guixiang, and Zhu Along of the union's social affairs section worked very hard in this negotiation.</p>
<h3>The Barges in the Chongxin Cotton Mill Have Been Resolved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Customs Brokerage Industry Union, due to the new wooden bridge built in front of the Chongxin Cotton Mill in Huxi, canceled the barges used since July 1st. When customs brokerage workers went to pick up the goods, they had to be transported by self-employed porters, which was quite inconvenient. They flocked to the union to report the matter and requested the restoration of the original barges. The union sent people to negotiate, but the negotiations broke down, resulting in a dispute. Later, the union sent a letter to the Cotton Yarn Industry Market, instructing the factory to restore the barges. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Cotton Yarn Market, informing that the factory had agreed to restore the original barges. The dispute has therefore come to an end.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Health Bureau Will Announce the Registration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors Within Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau held its sixth registration for traditional Chinese medicine doctors. The bureau successively summoned all traditional Chinese medicine doctors to the bureau to go through oral, written, and clinical tests and other procedures. It is now known that the bureau's review committee has finished reviewing the test papers as of yesterday. It is estimated that 497 medical practitioners and 111 doctors have passed the registration this year. The bureau will soon submit the review process and the list of medical practitioners and doctors who have been approved for registration to the municipal government for record, and will also send letters to each medical practitioner and doctor to notify them to go to the bureau in due course to obtain their registration certificates.</p>

<h3>Sudden Cool Weather's Impact</h3>
<p>▲Sudden Coolness… Breeding Numerous Diseases</p>
<p>▲Rainfall… Reports of Disaster from Various Villages</p>
<p>We are in the Great Heat period, but the weather has drastically changed. For the past few days, it was unusually sweltering, but for the last two days, it has suddenly become extremely cool. The Fahrenheit thermometer has plummeted to 73 degrees. A cool breeze is blowing, and there is continuous rain. Wearing only thin cloth clothes is not enough to keep warm. Older people are all wearing lined clothes and need to cover themselves with thin blankets and padded mattresses at night. This weather is like that of the fifth month. Compared to the scorching heat of last week, there is a difference of about 30 degrees. The impact on various aspects is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Widespread Human Illnesses: Since the continuous rain and alternating warm and cold weather in this city, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in various places. In the last two days, it has suddenly become too cool, and people are experiencing fever and headaches. In severe cases, there is incessant vomiting. As a result, the number of patients seeking treatment at the epidemic hospitals in this city has suddenly increased, and the hospital wards are overflowing with patients. This is mostly due to catching a cold. If one is careless and does not cover themselves with a thin blanket at night, illness will immediately occur. We hope that everyone will pay extra attention.</p>
<p>▲Losses for Cold Drink Vendors: During the hot season, cold drink shops on various roads in this city were originally thriving. However, the recent cool weather, with no sweat on people's bodies, naturally leads to a lack of customers for ice cream, shaved ice, soda, and other cold products. It is also reported that the first batches of watermelons and cantaloupes purchased by fruit businesses in both the northern and southern markets are unsellable. Although the price is only about three yuan per load, the cold weather means there are few buyers. Therefore, businesses are greatly affected. Fortunately, the goods are still fresh, and the losses are limited.</p>
<p>▲Repeated Reports of Floods in Various Villages: Since the torrential rain on the 6th of this month, it has been half a month of continuous rain, causing rivers to swell. As a result, low-lying areas in Pudong and western Shanghai have become a vast expanse of water. Rice paddies and vegetables are submerged. Farmers are anxiously hoping for sunny weather and receding water so they can salvage their crops. Unexpectedly, it continues to rain, and the water level is rising drastically in secret. Flood conditions are already apparent. According to people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, farmland in various villages such as Dongting Mountain, Mudu, Tangkou, and Hongta in Suzhou has been submerged. Rice seedlings are floating on the water. Farmers are rushing to the county to report crop failures, almost continuously on the road. It is also reported that Shaoxing and Wenzhou in Zhejiang have also become watery regions. In addition, mountain torrents have erupted, creating a severe situation. The people are suffering great losses, and disaster conditions are in place. There is a fear of a complete loss of the autumn harvest.</p>
<h3>Husband is Congenitally Impotent, Wife Sues for Divorce</h3>
<p>▲No Conjugal Relations for Over a Year</p>
<p>▲Plaintiff is Still a Virgin</p>
<p>▲Husband and Mother-in-Law Frequently Abuse Her</p>
<p>▲Seeking Compensation and Divorce</p>
<p>Li Tangshi, a woman from Jiangbei, 21 years old, married Li Shengfang from Ningbo last March. Now she has hired lawyer Gao Wenqi to file a lawsuit in the special court, requesting permission to divorce and demanding that Li Shengfang pay a total of 2,900 yuan in consolation and living expenses. The reason is that Li suffers from congenital impotence. After more than a year of marriage, they have never had conjugal relations, and he has abused her. Her complaint states: The plaintiff married Li Shengfang last March through matchmaker Zhang Jinsheng. Unexpectedly, the defendant suffers from a hidden disease and cannot engage in sexual relations. Therefore, for more than a year, the plaintiff has remained a virgin. Both parties can be examined to verify this. They are husband and wife in name only, with no emotional connection. The greatest desire of life is completely extinguished (commonly known as "congenital impotence," which is what is referred to in item 7 of Article 1052 of the Family Law as "having an incurable, serious disease"). The plaintiff's mother-in-law and husband do not treat her with the respect due a daughter-in-law but treat her like a servant. If she disagrees with them, she is abused, and the abuse gradually increases to physical assault. On the ninth day of the first lunar month of this year, she was beaten with bamboo sticks and tied with hemp ropes, resulting in injuries all over her body. Her mother-in-law aided and abetted the abuse. The matter was reported to the police station. On March 28 of this year, due to a trivial matter, the defendant pressed the plaintiff's face onto broken glass, causing serious facial injuries and profuse bleeding. She went to the Shanghai South People's Hospital for treatment and obtained a medical certificate. She also filed a self-accusation of assault in the criminal court of your court, but it was rejected because it did not meet the self-accusation regulations. However, the defendant, suffering from a serious illness, should not have married the plaintiff, causing her lifelong harm. Furthermore, this behavior clearly constitutes malicious abandonment. Her lifelong happiness has been stripped away by him. Given the marital facts, it is impossible to live together. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 1056 of the Family Law, the defendant should compensate her for the loss of 500 yuan in order to console her for the harm and abandonment, leaving her unable to support herself. The defendant should pay living expenses of at least 20 yuan per month, which, calculated over ten years, amounts to 2,400 yuan. Furthermore, based on the precedents of the Supreme Court's judgments Shang Zi No. 1457 in the fifth year, No. 1073, No. 634 in the sixth year, and the second clause of the resolution on the women's movement of the Second National Congress of the National Government, it is requested that the plaintiff be granted a divorce from the defendant Li Shengfang. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong opened the court to summon and question them. Li Tangshi stated the facts of the case, but the defendant stated in his defense: "I used to work in a foreign goods shop opened by my cousin, Shi Zhenmin. Now that Shi's shop has closed down, I have returned to my hometown. I have no residence in Shanghai and am only temporarily living at my cousin's house." He also hired a lawyer to raise the issue of jurisdiction. Judge Xu verified the statements and stated that the case still needs investigation and will be questioned after clarification.</p>
<h3>Zou Aizhen Sues Dr. Tang for Divorce</h3>
<p>▲Demands 10,000 Yuan in Alimony</p>
<p>▲Demands 10,000 Yuan for Children's Education</p>
<p>The lawsuit between Dr. Tang Huixuan (i.e., Tang Chongci), an economics PhD, and his wife Zou Aizhen in the Shanghai District Court has been ongoing for nearly ten months. The newspapers have reported it countless times. Now Tang Huixuan has filed another lawsuit in the Special District Court, which is still in progress. Zou Aizhen, on the other hand, has hired lawyer Yang Zhihao to apply for divorce in the mediation court of the District Court. Because the defendant did not appear, the mediation failed. Zou then formally filed a lawsuit for divorce, demanding 10,000 yuan in alimony and 10,000 yuan for her children's education expenses. She also requested assistance with the litigation costs. Her statement roughly stated that the defendant, Tang Chongci, had abandoned her and that she was requesting a judgment to order him to pay alimony and grant the divorce. The plaintiff married the defendant, Tang Chongci, i.e., Tang Huixuan, in 1923. Not long after the marriage, she discovered that the defendant already had a wife in his hometown of Guangxi. She negotiated with him, and the defendant wrote a letter of repentance, which was kept as evidence. At that time, the plaintiff and defendant were in a foreign land, and the plaintiff was helpless and unable to resist, so she endured the humiliation and sought peace, hoping for eternal love and happiness. After returning to China, the defendant could not find a job and was in difficult circumstances. The plaintiff used her mother's savings to help him, and even mortgaged her mother's family property to support him. He then obtained the position of director of the Yichang stamp tax bureau. At the beginning of his tenure, the plaintiff did not go with him. Later, she heard that he was spending lavishly in Yichang, gambling and engaging in prostitution. The plaintiff, fearing that he would run out of money and his reputation would be ruined, which would affect his job, went to Yichang to advise him. Unexpectedly, the defendant was overly enthusiastic at the time, and her honest advice fell on deaf ears, which angered him and caused a rift. Not long after, the defendant was dismissed. Afterward, disagreements arose, and their relationship deteriorated. She still remembers the tragic events of the night before August 18 last year. The defendant had a secret rendezvous with a woman who had come from Guangdong in a hotel. When the defendant first returned, the plaintiff immediately noticed that his actions were strange and secretly monitored him. That is why she went to confront him in person, resulting in an unhappy breakup. The defendant then conspired to launch a preemptive strike, intending to trap the plaintiff in a perpetual state of misery. Fortunately, your court saw through his plan, and her grievances were redressed. However, the defendant used this as an excuse to shirk his responsibilities, completely disregarding the plaintiff and her children. How can this be justified? The love between husband and wife has already broken down, but without a legal divorce, the defendant's crime of abandonment cannot be denied. The plaintiff is struggling to survive and raise her children and cannot bear it any longer. She requests permission for a divorce and alimony, etc. At 10:00 a.m. on the morning of the hearing, Judge Tong Shenglv opened the eighth court to hear the case. The defendant, Tang Chongci, did not appear. Only the plaintiff, accompanied by lawyer Yang Zhihao, appeared in court. Zou Aizhen testified that she was 26 years old, a native of Shanghai, and currently residing at No. 20 Wenmiao Road. She also recounted the previous events, stating that on August 16 last year, the defendant's companion first dragged out her younger sister, realizing that it was a mistake, and then dragged her out, falsely accusing her of improper behavior. His sinister intentions are evident. The judge said, "Your request for divorce is falling into the defendant's trap." She replied, "Previously, the defendant wanted me to divorce him privately, promising to give me 2,000 yuan. Because I have not committed any wrongdoing, I refused. Now that the defendant has such intentions, I fear being framed again if we reconcile." The judge said, "The defendant is not present today. We will summon him again for review." The court was then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Pudong Electric Company Implements Loan Program for Installing Lights</h3>
<p>丨Effective August 1st of this Year丨</p>
<p>▲Facilitating Citizens and Developing Businesses</p>
<p>▲Other Electric Companies Can Follow Suit</p>
<p>For the past year, due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, kerosene prices have continued to rise. Considering the situation of the general public, it is more convenient and economical to use electric lights than to burn kerosene lamps. However, the cost of installing lights is quite high, so some people are temporarily limited by their financial resources and delay the installation. The Pudong Electric Company, in order to help common households popularize electricity, has specially formulated a loan program for installing lights, as follows: (1) Registration: Anyone who wants to install electric lights but cannot pay the installation fee in full and wants to borrow money from the company to repay it in installments can go to the company (at the Zhangjiabangkou in Pudong) or registered electrical shops or electrical installers (hereinafter referred to as installers) to fill out a "Loan Application for Installing Lights" and find a reliable guarantor to co-sign and seal it and submit it to the company. After investigation and approval, they will be registered, and a "Loan Registration Form for Installing Lights" along with a blank loan certificate will be mailed to the household to be effective. (2) Number of Households: Starting from August 1, 1931, the program is limited to 1,000 households and will be terminated when the quota is full. If the quota is not full by December 31, it will not be extended. (3) Type of Households: Limited to new households that have not yet installed lights. Households that have already installed lights and want to add more lights are not eligible. (4) Location: Limited to areas covered by the company's current power lines. It does not include areas where additional poles and lines are required to connect to electricity. (5) Number of Lights: This program is specifically designed to help small households, so each household is limited to three to five lights. Loan will not be given to those who need to install six or more lights. (6) Guarantee: Limited to shops near the household that have already installed electric lights and have not borrowed money from the company under this program to install lights. The company may add restrictions if the number of guaranteed households is too large. (7) Installation Fee: The installation fee and wire costs are determined by the household and the installer. The company is not involved. However, if the installer charges excessive fees or demands extra expenses, it can be reported to the company for investigation. (8) Loan: For each light installed, the company can borrow three yuan and five jiao without interest. Upon completion of the installation, the loan certificate must be filled out in the prescribed form, co-signed and sealed by the guarantor, and brought to the company with the installer to receive the loan. The installation fee and wire costs will be settled with the installer on the spot and paid in full. If the expenses exceed the loan amount, the household must pay the difference. (9) Repayment: The loan is repaid in twelve monthly installments, with each light costing three jiao per month. After full repayment, the light line will be fully owned by the household. If payment is not made on time, the guarantor is responsible for handling it. An additional one jiao per light will be charged to compensate the company for the cost of printing documents and affixing stamp duties. (10) Deposit: The deposit for installing lights must still be paid in full at the time of application, according to the company's business regulations. (11) Supplementary Provisions: In addition to the items listed in this program, other matters not covered will be handled in accordance with the company's business regulations. It is reported that the Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that this program can facilitate citizens in installing lights and develop the company's business, achieving both goals. In addition to approving its filing, it has also ordered other electric companies in the city to follow suit when necessary.</p>

<h3>Pigtails Cause a lot of harm</h3>

<p>▲Eyes and ears bleeding, still in a dangerous period</p>
<p>Tang Mou's daughter, named Nannan, a 14-year-old resident of Chuanhong Port, Pudong, across the Wusong River, was a helper in the fine yarn room of the Huafeng Yarn Factory. When she was leaving the factory at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, a female co-worker named Yin A'mei, a 17-year-old native of Sitangqiao, Songbei, asked Nannan to comb her hair. Nannan, not wanting to refuse out of politeness, combed Yin's pigtail for her. In her confusion, she accidentally brought the end of her own pigtail into the locomotive, and her head was pulled in. She was immediately rescued by others, and the driver stopped the car immediately. Because the back of her head was severely injured, causing her eyes and ears to bleed non-stop, she immediately lost consciousness. Later, she was sent to the Wusong Seaside Public Hospital for treatment.

<h3>A Record of the Public Changlong Sandboat's Disaster</h3>
<p>▲First hit by a hurricane, then by pirates</p>
<p>▲Crew Member Wu Bochen and the Ship Owner Sigh in Despair</p>
<p>The Public Changlong sandboat, owned by the Public Profit Company, used to sail to Southeast Asia, carrying passengers and cargo. This spring, because there were not many passengers and cargo going from Shanghai, it changed its route to North China, including Yingkou, Andong, and Dalian, to transport goods for sale. The company specifically set up branches in Yingkou and Andong. The ship loaded with native cloth and woollen goods, etc. from Shanghai at the beginning of last month, and transported them to Andong to unload and sell, for more than 40,000 taels of silver, which was used to purchase soybean oil and goods from the north. It was loaded onto the ship on the 5th of this month to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it reached the waters off Tongshan, a hurricane suddenly erupted, and the waves were fierce and urgent, crashing onto the deck. Four crew members working on deck were washed away by the waves. The ship owner was frightened and, seeing that there was no port nearby to seek shelter, instructed the helmsman to turn the rudder and head straight for the coast. Unexpectedly, the wind and waves became even more violent. Just as he was turning the rudder, the rudder was smashed by a huge wave, causing it to lose steering power. The crew was helpless and had to retreat to the cabin. Then, a huge wave crashed the ship onto the outer beach of Chongming, hitting the front half of the ship. The ship broke and ran aground on the sand. The crew, seeing that it was not far from Wusong, planned to send a boat to Shanghai to report. They sent a boat to unload the goods. Suddenly, the pirates learned of this. At midnight, they arrived in several ships and robbed the goods from the north. The soybean oil jars were broken, and the oil leaked out. The pirates, seeing that the jars were empty, were furious and threw them into the sea. Yesterday, the Public Profit Company received the report. The value of the ship and cargo was estimated at 120,000-130,000 taels. It is said that the bottom of the ship was broken by ten feet and could not be repaired. A steamer has now been hired to transport the crew, tools, and other items back to Shanghai. The ship itself is to be sold. A reward has been offered for the four crew members washed away, and fishing boats in the Tongshan area have been entrusted to search for their bodies.</p>
<h3>Despondent Youth Jumps into the Huangpu River, Rescued</h3>
<p>At 11:00 p.m. the night before last, a young man boarded a sampan and jumped into the Huangpu River at the mouth of the Suzhou River to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by the sampan operator, who reported it to Chinese Constable No. 14 of the Customs Water Patrol. The constable took him to the police station. He identified himself as Zhang Zihua, 20 years old, from Yunnan, residing at No. 35 Jufuxi Fang. He had no job in Shanghai and planned to go to Xuzhou to find a friend to seek employment, but he had no travel expenses. Therefore, he pawned a long gown for only eight jiao, which was not enough to cover his travel expenses. While on the tram, a pickpocket stole all eight jiao. After discovering it, the thief had already fled far away. Thinking that his fate was hopeless, he decided to commit suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River to avoid starving to death. Fourteen copper coins, ten pawn tickets, and a few miscellaneous items were found on his person. When asked if he had any relatives in Shanghai, he said that he had an uncle named Zhang Zhongliang. The head constable dispatched Detective Huang Songsheng to inform his uncle, who sent someone to the police station to take Zhang back.</p>
<h3>National Physicians' Association Requests French Concession to Exempt Doctors from Levies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Physicians' Association, regarding the French Concession's collection of levies from doctors, sent a letter to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association, stating: "We respectfully write to inform you that previously, when the French Municipal Council (FMC) organized the registration of doctors, our association and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau negotiated with the FMC. We were granted permission for a one-time registration, with a fee of two yuan. Doctors from outside the Concession were not required to register. This was confirmed in a written reply to our association. Now, according to reports from our members, the FMC, in addition to the registration, is levying a 'health donation,' requiring each doctor to pay two yuan annually. Although the amount is small, it contradicts the FMC's letter to our association dated February 27th, which stated that the registration fee was a one-time charge. Furthermore, doctors are a type of free profession, similar in nature to lawyers and accountants. It is difficult to categorize them as being in the same category as restaurants, thereby subjecting them to a health bureau levy and requiring annual payments. Moreover, other Chinese concessions and settlements do not have precedents for requiring doctors to pay levies. Forcing them to pay levies not only causes unnecessary disturbances, but the total amount collected would also be less than a thousand yuan, which the bureau should not collect. We believe your association is a taxpayers' organization in the French Concession and the voice of the Chinese people. We request that you forward a letter to the FMC to exempt doctors from the health donation. We earnestly hope for this. Respectfully submitted to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association by the Shanghai National Physicians' Association."</p>

<p>▲ Cigar Industry There are about twenty or thirty cigar factories in Shanghai. They once organized an association, but the registration procedures were not completed, resulting in failure. Now, due to the current situation, the industry believes that it is necessary to establish a trade association for protection and to maintain the market. Ten or more people, including Teng Zhixiang, Shen Rongxuan, and He Shenji, initiated the reorganization of the original association and applied for registration. It has taken more than two months since preparations began. The Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee issued approval No. 4184 the day before, approving the establishment and issuing a certificate. The association received the certificate and immediately issued a notice of assembly, scheduling an important meeting today to arrange the steps to be taken.</p>

Unexpectedly, this year, the contractor contracted to collect the local school contribution, falsely collecting sand and mud, at a cost of 20-30 cents per ton.

It is justified to request the government to thoroughly investigate and abolish this, to alleviate the people's hardship.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read the news article "Stepmother Abuses Daughter to Death Case" published in your newspaper on the 19th of this month. The content has some discrepancies. I would like to inform you as follows: My late wife, Mrs. He, passed away from illness only half a month after giving birth to my daughter, Bao Yun. At that time, there was no one to breastfeed her. Every possible nurturing method was used to ensure her survival, which I was very happy about. After five years, due to the lack of a wife, it was inconvenient, so I remarried. Her stepmother loved her very much, and her grandparents also loved her very much. She was able to reach the age of sixteen, and all expenses for her education were borne. On the 17th of this month, my daughter stole a neighbor's rattan chair and brought it home. When it was discovered, I scolded her for not bringing other people's belongings into the house without permission. Unexpectedly, she had a habit of deceiving, and she secretly drank the "Sal," which was prepared for bathing. When it was discovered, she was immediately sent to the Dongyang Hospital for two emergency injections. According to the doctor, it had been too long, and the effect would likely be ineffective. Later, she was sent to the Guangdong Hospital for treatment, but she died. The whole family was very sad and speechless. There was no reason for abuse. I hereby declare the facts, hoping that you will publish them. Sincerely, Qiu Jinsheng, July 22nd.</p>

<h3>Our Dean of Students</h3>
<p>— Bingxi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Mumu's "Dean of Students", I couldn't help but smile. It's so strange. I thought our dean of students, Mr. Yi, was so unique. Who knew there would be someone just like him. Let me introduce him to you.</p>
<p>Mr. Yi is a new student returned from the United States. He is of moderate height and very thin. He sometimes wears a suit, sometimes a Chinese gown. Perhaps he thinks that a suit can express the youth's heroism, so whenever there are visiting guests or memorial meetings, he wears a very beautiful suit. Otherwise, he sometimes wears everything at once, like a fur robe or camel's hair robe. His face looks like he's sick, but he's very good at ball games. It's just a pity that his ears aren't doing their job.</p>
<p>I remember the first time he came to class, many of us happened to be late.</p>
<p>"No one is allowed to be late next time," he said with a straight face. "I think equality between men and women must be practiced everywhere, so I treat girls the same as boys. If any of you girls are dissatisfied with my strict policies, please don't come to class." As he spoke, he shot a sharp look at those of us who were late.</p>
<p>"He's so fierce," a voice came from the right corner of the classroom. Immediately, we all laughed.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at?" he became even angrier. The whole room was silent immediately. Then he raised his voice and said,</p>
<p>"In America, students are not allowed to enter the classroom after the teacher..."</p>
<p>"American Students are much more polite to teachers than you..."</p>
<p>"Go and see an American School, and see if there is any laughter in the classroom..."</p>
<p>"Who taught this book last semester?" he asked after a moment.</p>
<p>"It was also someone who liked to talk about America," a student replied.</p>
<p>Then there was another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he didn't hear the reason we were laughing.</p>
<p>Mr. Yi has a phonograph. He invites everyone to his bedroom to appreciate it, so his bedroom is like a marketplace. Every day after school, many people can be seen in his room. He proudly turns it on and explains,</p>
<p>"These records were all brought back from America..."</p>
<p>"It's America again," someone in the crowd always says with a sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing is that one day he brought the phonograph to the classroom.</p>
<p>"These are some educational records I recently bought, so I'll let you all listen to them. It can improve your English," so he turned it on and on, not stopping until the end of class.</p>
<p>If we listen to educational records every time we go to class, won't we get tired of it? Therefore, we had to turn on movie records as well. He listened quietly, moving his feet back and forth, left and right, probably practicing dancing.</p>
<p>At that time, in the students' minds, Mr. Yi was suffering from a mental illness.</p>
<p>Mr. Yi is very nice to us girls. He invites you to eat, teaches you how to play ball, comes to your house to visit you... There's no end to it. If we have anything to bother him with, he never refuses.</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?"</p>
<p>"Do you have a boyfriend?"</p>
<p>"Social interaction between men and women here is too secretive..."</p>
<p>"The boys here have no personality..."</p>
<p>"We in America..."</p>
<p>These are all Mr. Yi's conversations with the girls, but one thing made us angry. When we heard that his tone with the boys was like this:</p>
<p>"Women are the most hateful and disgusting..." So his remarks are all inconsistent.</p>
<p>"He must have a mental illness."</p>
<p>"Li must have been dumped before."</p>
<p>These are the criticisms of him by many students.</p>
<h3>Five Dollars</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>One evening around 7:30 PM on the 11th, my family was sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool air after dinner because of the hot weather. There were about a dozen of us. I was upstairs preparing to take a bath when a family member downstairs called out, "San Ying, there's a guest for you!" I rushed downstairs and saw a middle-aged woman I didn't recognize. I was surprised and asked her surname. She calmly told me her surname was Li, and that she was the elder sister of my classmate, the female athlete Li. She said the female athlete Li was her third younger sister. I invited her to sit down while I carefully observed her attire. She wore a bright green Indian qipao with slits up to a foot high, and high-heeled black leather shoes. She told me that her sister had informed her of everything about my school, such as how strict a certain director was, leaving almost no room for questions, and how the entire student body was dissatisfied with another director, but he was still hired for the next semester due to some reason. She even knew the short histories of each teacher, and even that the dormitory supervisor, Mr. Wu, had ugly handwriting and brought his child with him. She knew everything in detail. Moreover, she spoke fluent classical Chinese, saying things like, "It's best to avoid bad friends," and "One should stay away from people with improper behavior," and "At home, you rely on your parents; away from home, you rely on your teachers and friends," and so on.</p>
<p>Naively inexperienced in the ways of the world, I believed that everyone in society maintained their integrity, so I didn't doubt her and fully trusted that she was my classmate's sister. Later, I asked her the purpose of her visit. She furtively said, "I need to use the WC upstairs." This made me even more trusting, and I thought that was indeed her purpose, so I happily accompanied her upstairs and even let her wash her face. As she was leaving, she said to me, "Miss Wang, I'm embarrassed to say this, but I'm short of cash today and need to go to Nanjing on the 11 PM train. I'm short ten dollars. Could you lend me ten dollars?" I replied, "Let me ask my family if they have any."</p>
<p>So I discussed with my mother whether to lend her the money. My mother said, "She's probably a trickster. Don't lend it." But my vanity clouded my judgment, and I thought, "Surely I can't refuse to lend her a mere ten dollars? Wouldn't that be ridiculous? If it's real, how could I face my classmate, the female athlete Li?" So I advocated lending it. My mother said, "Then lend her five dollars, as if you're throwing it away." So I took a five-dollar bill upstairs and saw her staring intently at the two silver dollars my little brother was playing with, making clanging sounds. I handed her the money and said, "My mother just went out. I borrowed this from my aunt, so I only have five dollars. Is it enough?" She said, "I need about seven dollars." Haha, she was thinking about the two silver dollars my little brother had! I replied, "Just take a third-class seat then." She very politely said goodbye.</p>
<p>The story ends here, but the more I thought about it afterward, the more I suspected she was a con artist, but I couldn't say for sure. Well, it's been proven today. My classmate, Ms. Zhu, wrote to tell me she encountered a con artist and warned me to be careful. And according to the facts Ms. Zhu described, it was the exact same trick I had experienced, just with a slight variation. The con artist also said she needed to go to Nanjing and was short of cash. As a result, Ms. Zhu was also conned out of five dollars.</p>

<h3>The Life of Working Women in New York</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(7) A Glimpse of Life</p>
<p>Now let us use a microscope to examine the life of working women in New York, and see how they live at home, at work, and in the vast society. To get a true picture, we must write out their daily life. Their ranks are divided by the size of their salaries. Each example is unique, but of course, there are many exceptions.</p>
<p>The daily life of Minnie Roschild, a woman who earns ten to fifteen dollars a week, is as follows:</p>
<p>"Minnie, Minnie, wake up, you lazy bones!"</p>
<p>"Ah, Mom, let me sleep five more minutes."</p>
<p>"That's what you said ten minutes ago, Minnie. If you're late, you'll be punished. You know that. The rent is due again, and I don't dare go to the butcher because I owe him a lot of money. And..."</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom, I'm getting up. Please stop nagging."</p>
<p>Minnie jumped out of her iron bed. She shared a room with her two younger sisters. There was no perfumed bath for her to take. Her two younger sisters, Rose and Connie, were already eating their breakfast. As Minnie got dressed, their conversation drifted into her ears.</p>
<p>"I can work next year, too. Isn't that a great thing? Maybe Minnie will take me to her store. But I want to go to Galsapp's. Isn't that a big store? Just think, I'll earn twelve dollars a month!"</p>
<p>Minnie hurriedly put on her shoes and stopped, saying, "Ah, Rose, don't say that. You don't know what luck is. Standing behind a counter wrapping packages all day isn't that great. You should hope to study at school for two more years."</p>
<p>"Minnie, your coffee is burnt," Mrs. Roschild shouted sharply.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, Mom, I'm late. Give me a piece of bread dipped in coffee. I can't be late today. The new supervisor is not easy to get along with."</p>
<p>Minnie swallowed the coffee and a large chunk of soggy bread, then put on her hat and hurried out the door, shouting, "Goodbye, Mom! Goodbye, kids!"</p>
<p>The Roschild family lived in a rented house on the outskirts of the city. Mr. Roschild ran a construction business. When he had work, he went out early in the morning and came home for dinner in the evening. The eldest child was twenty-four years old, already married and had a child. He worked as an assistant electrical engineer. His wife, who had once worked as a stenographer, considered herself superior to her husband's family, so Minnie was very dissatisfied with her.</p>
<p>Minnie took the subway alone. On the way, she thought about her sister-in-law. She wanted to buy an interesting newspaper, but she was stingy with her money. One newspaper every day would cost twelve cents a week, which was not a small amount. Secretly, Minnie envied her sister-in-law. She didn't understand why her sister-in-law had given up a twenty-five-dollar-a-week job working in a fancy office just to take care of her family and a small child.</p>
<p>This morning, Minnie got a seat on the subway. Usually, even if she got on the train early, she wouldn't get a seat. When the train reached the city center, she was pushed and squeezed by men and women going to work. Sometimes she got really angry, and she would poke her elbow into someone's ribs and shout, "What's going on here?" The men in the crowded subway often tried to get some fresh gossip, but Minnie never treated them silently.</p>
<p>Finally, she arrived at her station, with only five minutes to spare. She had to walk past three tenement buildings to get to the store. She had to punch the time clock in the cloakroom, so she ran all the way, bumping into several pedestrians. She didn't care about them. If she was late, she would have to wait an hour before she could start work. The other women were also very busy, all rushing into the employees' entrance, then going upstairs. Most of the women wore inexpensive light blue or black dresses, the two colors that the store allowed employees to wear. After punching the time clock, Minnie slowly walked to her stall. Her position was in the hosiery department on the lower floor. The hosiery department was often very busy. To Minnie, it seemed like miles of stockings passed through her hands every day. Many of the socks that were sold only needed to be put into a bag to be finished. The packaging work for other departments was much more difficult, although they didn't have to be as fast as packing socks. Minnie felt very lucky that she didn't have to pack blankets, cooking utensils, or toys. Some days, she worked like a machine in the hosiery department, and other days, she fantasized about the lives of the customers. She loved every pair of sheer French stockings. First, she folded the socks and put them in a tissue paper package, then put them in a thick paper bag. Minnie knew that one could only wear these socks once or twice, like a handful of foam. She found it strange that customers nonchalantly paid five dollars a pair for them. The buyer was probably a female singer, or maybe a real movie star. Also, there were schoolgirls who used the money they got for their birthdays to buy this luxury item. There were also many pretty customers who often made Minnie shrug. It only took a few minutes of an employee's time for women like these to buy such things. Minnie didn't care whether the customers were truly rich or just looked like it. She was just very interested in them. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Marshal Foch's War Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The first problem to be solved was arranging for the rapid participation of French army reserves in the British army's defense zone battles, and the entry of British army reserves into the French army's zone to help in the battle. Commander-in-Chief Haig and Commander Petain had already studied this point separately, and the prepared troops were only a few divisions. Now it was time to jointly study again, and consider mobilizing all the forces of the Allied forces. This matter became the main purpose of the letters I sent to the two commanders on June 13th. This work was completed on the 20th.</p>
<p>Consolidating the defense lines of the British and French armies was also important. Regarding the British army's defense line, it was advocated to dispatch American troops and several British divisions to strengthen the defense.</p>
<p>The deployment position of the Allied forces focused on remotely protecting Paris. At the same time, in order to prevent unexpected events, a defense was arranged in the suburbs of Paris. Commander Guillaumat, who was recalled from the eastern front, was responsible for this task.</p>
<p>A meeting was convened at the Allied Headquarters in Bombon on June 15th. Chairman Clemenceau, (Note: The attendees were the Deputy Chairman of the Paris Defense Committee, Doumer, the Chairman of the Military Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Renault, and Commanders Foch, Petain, Guillaumat, Degoutte, Hell, Mordacq, and Weygand, etc.) clearly divided the powers of the various military authorities.</p>
<p>The first step of the outline was to determine the defense of Paris. The troops designated by Commander Foch were fully responsible, step by step. The second step was to determine that if the enemy army went straight to Paris, advancing to the Manceuil-Clermont line on the Thérain River, the Paris military commander would take command of the troops defending the area between the Oise River, the Marne River, and the two river basins according to the orders of the French army commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>At the same time, this officer would have to prepare a defense plan, digging trenches and building fortifications in the suburbs of Paris from Antony to Noisy. The position of the garrison should take into account both defense and transportation.</p>
<p>For the convenience of military affairs, it was further decided to include Paris in the main battle zone. A liaison office was set up at the French army headquarters, and Commander Guillaumat was able to fully understand the situation of the French army.</p>
<p>The various arrangements in the front and rear were nothing more than the Allied forces' steps to meet the enemy's new offensive, and the preparation for our army's great defensive battle. But while planning to prevent the enemy from attacking, I did not forget that the Allied forces must immediately prepare to change to an offensive, because only an offensive battle can win the final victory of the war.</p>
<p>Two areas had already been selected for attack, and the main preliminary work had been completed by the various armies, for the British army in the area of the Lys River, and for the French army between the Oise River and the Somme River. But the German army's incursion from the Aisne River deep into the Marne River to Château-Thierry changed the situation, and a new war zone was created for the Allied forces.</p>
<p>In fact, it was easy to see that the enemy's isolated forces had penetrated deeply, and the railway was its only suitable transportation route, and these many routes all passed through Soissons. Therefore, if this important transportation hub was attacked by our army's artillery, "any attack by the German army in the Château-Thierry area would be in vain."</p>
<p>At that time, our army had already completed its deployment, and only long-range artillery could bombard Soissons. Long-range artillery fire was sufficient to affect the enemy's supply, but it could not be completely cut off. To achieve this goal, mobile heavy artillery and field artillery must also be used. Because it was necessary to deploy artillery positions, on June 14th, I asked Commander Petain to "prepare to attack and seize the high ground west of Soissons, which is a strategically important place that must not be owned by the enemy."</p>
<p>According to the military order of June 7th, the Fifth Army had already prepared to attack the eastern flank of Château-Thierry, but the German army's attack in the Compiègne area had greatly subsided. The enemy army had stopped in Metz, and the attack in this area was no longer important. Because of the slowdown, for this reason, I asked Commander Petain to immediately order the Tenth Army to prepare to attack, recapture the Plateau of Dommiers, and do so quickly before the enemy could calmly deploy their defenses.</p>
<p>Commander Petain immediately issued an order, limiting the Tenth Army to advance to "the line of Pournois-Missy-sur-Aisne." A few days later, on June 20th, the commander of the Tenth Army, Commander Mangin, drew up an operation plan, which was approved by the French army commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>At the end of June, the Allied forces prepared three attack locations in different areas, namely the Lys River, the Somme River, and the Marne River. Our army prepared to attack first in the third area. This plan did not hinder our army's preparation for a general offensive along the entire line, so all officers and men should prepare themselves for the opportunity to arrive.</p>
<p>The method of this offensive and the time of the start of the attack must be carefully selected. Since March 21st, the Allied forces had suffered many fierce battles and heavy losses. After the start of the war, the enemy had been winning, and even if there were some setbacks, they were exchanged for by the Allied forces at a great sacrifice. The strength of the enemy army was well known to everyone.</p>
<p>Therefore, to improve this impression, the most important thing was to win a battle. If there was a setback in the attack, our army must not be put in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>The planned attack on the Soissons-Château-Thierry line should use the Aisne River to protect the left wing. If the attack was thwarted, it would not fall into the dangerous situation of an isolated army penetrating deeply with dangerous flanks.</p>
<p>Finally, although our army initially hoped to attack in only one place, the Allied forces' entire plan should be prepared for support, so that after a successful strike, taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the various armies would advance separately and meet in one place. This would greatly increase the effectiveness of our army's entire operation.</p>
<p>After three years of trench warfare, our army should once again understand the power of action, and its practice and the sensitivity of objects. These military knowledge should be instilled in new and old officers and soldiers using a simple text.</p>
<p>Therefore, on June 27th, I asked Petain to issue a general order to the entire army, drawing up the outline of the offensive organization and conduct, and specifying the training time to complete the training of the French and American armies participating in this offensive.</p>
<p>Finally, I informed him that, at a certain stage of this offensive, I would mobilize all the troops of the French, American, and British armies. Their preparation should be completed within at least two months. The planned combat force must be at least twelve American divisions, twelve French divisions, and seven or eight British divisions.</p>
<p>Although the cooperation of the American army was still in its initial stage, expectations were very high. The Allied forces initially believed in the effect of the American army's participation in the war. Now this information is increasing day by day. Therefore, when the Allied forces commander-in-chief mobilizes the American army to fight, he must be careful and responsible for commanding their officers, and must always proceed according to his plan.
