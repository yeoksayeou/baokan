<p>凡此種種議題。皆本届大會中討論工作之中心。過去我國代表在會議時。努力抗辦。爲國家爭體面之精神。吾人固巳深致欽敬。但於陳述我國内情形時。事實之敷陳。與各種統計數目字之叙述。都尚嫌材料未能充分搜羅。四届大會旣决在我國舉行。則我國代表更應以充分之準備。顯露新中國之真面目於各國代表之前。使其對我有正確之了解與認識。吾人深望國内學者。對於以上各問題。能多發抒精警之論著。以供大會之參考。俾各項問題。均能得到正確與滿意之結論。</p>
<p>近月以來。我國各地對於太平洋國際學會之責難。時有所聞。不曰該會爲帝國主義列强之代言者。即認該會爲欺騙與壓迫弱小民族之新集團。東方問題研究會。亞洲文化協會。及各地國民黨部均羣起反對。各地輿論。對該會亦多抨擊之詞。空穴來風。良非無故。此種反對開會之風聲。想非國人有意誤會。及好生事端。而實由於上届大會予吾國人以過分不良之印象。回憶上届大會。於討論東三省問題與中國外交問題時。各國代表對我國代表之陳訴。多置不理。英國則嚴守沉默。美國則專事調停。尤以日本代表竟直認日本在東三省之一切權利爲應得。幾次會内外之討論。其强詞奪理。爲其政府文過。巳完全失却學者之態度。與親善之誠意。因日本代表之失態。故三届大會閉幕後。國内輿論爲之一變。向之希望該會。贊美該會者。乃轉而爲詛咒與詆毁。此則日本代表所應完全負責。而兹後各國代表所應力予注意者也。（未完）</p>

<p>自由談世界小事記  海客　　半空中産兒　　近年以來。歐美航空事業異常發達。無論男女。都喜歡到空中去作空中旅行。好奇之人。更有在空中舉行結婚禮的。不道最近英國某地。有一個嬰兒産生在離地四千尺以上的半空之中。原來那産母。因爲分娩在即。急不及待。搭了一架單翼飛機上醫院去。不料飛到中途。那腹中的嬰兒就呱呱墮地了。半空中産兒。據說在歐美還是一個最新的紀錄。以前從未有過。至於在火車中産兒。倒是常有的事。最有趣的。是一九一八年間有一對雙生子生在火車中。因出世的時間有先後。所以一個生在美國境中。一個巳生在坎那大境中了。　　六千慈母弔國殤　　一九三零年五月間。美國有六千個婦人。遠迢迢地往歐洲去。在英國上岸。一同到當年世界大戰的戰地上去。憑弔那些爲國捐軀的戰士之墓。原來伊們都有兒子。在大戰中陣亡。當時就葬在戰地。並未歸骨故鄉。所以特來憑弔一番。此行的一切費用。全由美國政府担任。自五月至八月。分批出發。據說今年夏間。仍須如此。這真是一件使人感動的事。英國政府也打算照此辦法。資助英國的許多慈母。到戰地上去憑弔伊們戰死的愛子。光怪陸離之訃文  萍　　海上富商哈同旣逝。愛儷園治喪事務處擇於本月廿一日題主。連日分發訃文。與哈同生前有關之親友。此訃文之格式·措詞。頗爲奇特。亦晚近社會所不易經見者。節錄之以供閱者一粲。　　訃文作長方形。縱横爲二十四與十四寸之比例。共分八頁。全幅長八尺有奇。以言篇幅。則北洋軍閥·前清遺老·及黎黄陂總統所印之訃文。亦相形見絀。可見資本家豪奢之一斑。其文曰「大中華民國晉授勳一位、晉贈一等大綬寳光嘉禾章、晉贈一等文虎章、特贈抗懷希古匾額、歷贈二等大綬寳光嘉禾章、二等文虎章、二等嘉禾章、大清國特頒二等第一寳星、特恩賜宴、特頒爲樂最樂匾額、歷蒙頒給春條對聯、福字·壽字·龍字·虎字·無量壽佛、三鑲如意、江綢庫緞、白玉搬指、瓷瓶荷包、紅茶、果餌、佩文韻府全部、散氏盤拓本等、」次叙「大英國歐司哈同公。痛於西歷一千九百三十一年……即日遵照猶太敎禮。親視含殮恭率家族。一律成服安葬本園。…」下具主喪妻羅迦陵、及孤子、孤女共十一人、内姓義子、内姓義女、義孫、義孫女、義曾孫女、義子壻、義姪等二十八人。末具治喪主任義弟姬覺彌。觀上文。首叙大中華民國·次爲大清國·大英國·猶太。一紙訃告而具國號凡四。中西合璧。堪稱絶無僅有。哈同無子嗣。所稱孤子孤女者爲哈同自身之外國義子女。而冠以内姓者爲羅夫人之中國義子女也。姬覺彌亦以義弟資格附於末。尤屬罕見。　　側聞哈同之遺産。值七千五百萬兩。其一身勤儉之所獲。今將如何分配用途。載諸遺囑。因未見發表。不敢懸揣。惟吾人之意。哈同之財。取諸於華。亦當用之於華。方爲公允。又聞羅夫人擬撥一部分財産、建若干佛塔於愛儷園。獨未聞爲吾國家人民利益着想。竊以爲不可。倘能提出數成。在華廣施於敎育。慈善及有益於公衆之事業。爲社會國家謀幸福。以完成其未竟之宏志。庶幾功德無量拜感仁人之惠者。豈獨滬濱一隅而巳耶。哈同巳矣。甚望羅夫人能善體此旨。採納斯言。新七夕偶成  天虚我生　　今年新七夕。獨我住西冷。千里夢回遠。（滬杭相距四百餘里·每夜輒到滄洲·是往返近千里里·夢如能真·豈不大快·）三潭燈巳明·（三潭印月巳裝電燈·若於亭角廊簷·添設廻光燈映射荷塘·并通水綫·使塔燈俱明·映以毛玻璃·則無月之夜·亦有月矣·）詩腸應不斷。塵事暫全屏。（予患廻腸傷氣之疾·每咳甚·則小腹突起壘塊加墳·痛不可忍·需人按捺·始得復平·倘在佝僂時·强使壁立·則廻腸必斷·故遵醫囑·御腹壓帶巳久·此來苦熱·不得不卸去·然幸匝月未發·殆亦屏絶塵事·暫不搜索枯腸之效耳·）祇怪雙星嬾。填橋尚未成。（内子欲來·因病不果·予亦以病勾留·行期定而復改·故作此以代家書·）談有聲影片  聖涵　　攝製有聲影片之機器。有「維太風」·「富托風」·「慕維通」·數種。其中以「慕維通」爲最佳。因係片上發音。且最爲新式也。　　世界電影事業之中心。固舍美國之好萊塢莫屬。而有聲電影之機械。更以美國爲最精。即如德之科學發達。亦望塵莫及。而日本之善於摹倣者。乃亦不能仿傚。可見研究科學。殊非易事。　　自有聲電影問世以來。無聲影片雖不致完全淘汰。然己漸歸沉寂。即就海上各大電影院而言。無不競以開映有聲片相號召。而觀衆之目光。竟亦爲之轉移。　　天一公司近以四十萬金向美國購得「慕維通」機器全部。計十餘巨箱。内有卡車一輛。係攝外景時裝置全部攝影機及收音機之用。並有燈泡燈四十餘盞。因普通煤精燈。有一種聲浪。不適於攝有聲片之用也。　　隨機器同來者。有好萊塢有聲電影專家四人。一爲攝影師。曾在聯美公司任職多年。最近爲范朋克·琵琵但尼兒·攝取「銀河之月」。（此片曾在上海開映）其餘三人。則爲收音師·製片師·及設計師。據攝影師云。將來成績。决不在好萊塢出品之下。信斯言也。中國之有聲影片。當另開一新塲面。並聞該公司第一部有聲片爲「歌塲春色」。第二部爲「上海小姐」云。三蛇鼈  徐小庭　　動物之變化出於常態者。若孑　化爲蚊。蛹化爲蛾。此固生理上恒有之事。反則如雌雞變爲雄。毒蛇變爲鼈。皆爲吾人罕見罕覯之事。日前邑之北城外。有楊姓豆腐店夥友某甲。行於途中。偶購甲魚一尾。魚身與常魚無異。計費銅元四十餘枚。甲購後。特携至友人處。約與共食。友見之。食指大動。乃取利刃。從事剖腹。詎知刀未及身。甲魚尾下。忽露出一血色赤鱗之蛇頭。天矯伸縮。作吞噬狀。友見之駭甚。即棄於地。旋被人取起。刲其腹視之。第見腸形之物。塞滿其中。該鼈顯係毒蛇變成。事後據一般漁户談。此爲三蛇共合而成。食後必中毒。幸甲友發覺甚早。否則必有性命之憂。不侫常聞老農云。蛇之化鼈也。必先爬至樹顛。然後跌至於地即成鼈。若某甲所購者。腹中腸形之物塞滿。顯爲數蛇疊合而成。因記之。以供動物學家之研究。游韓漫談（七）  寄萍　　日本移民朝鮮的方法。真是妙不可言。他們利用朝鮮農民未受敎育思想簡單的弱點。用巧計來欺騙。一則他們在韓享有特權。二則日本人的智慧。超過韓人不知若干倍。所以到處佔優越的地位。可以予取予求。無不水到渠成。現在我舉一個例子來證明。　　韓國農民。貧苦的居多。而且不慣勤勞耐苦。所以生計常感到艱難的苦痛。竊極無聊時。惟有去借債。農村裏只有日本人多數富裕的。日本人遇到他們要借錢。表示很慷慨。毫不遲疑的借出。三次兩次。都不嫌其煩。可是利息很重而且要有抵押品。朝鮮人大都有疏懶的恶習。今天有了錢。就不想再做事。吸烟·飲酒·賭博。幹個痛快。明天用完了。後天再去做工。隨來隨去。　霍無度。這本是韓人最壞的流行病。債權人等你借欵的數目。愈積愈多。和你財産的代價相等時。就向你討債。倘如無力償還。那末好。把你的房屋或是田産來做抵押品。再限你一個日期。他明知道你是還不清的。只想要你的産業。不一定要還現欵。約期到了。你又是不名一文。他老不客氣。立刻就翻臉。報告警察署。扣押你的産業。轉售於日人。據說他們老是做這一套把戲。騙朝鮮人的房屋田産。日人最後的目標。就想把朝鮮肥沃的土地。優美的鄉村。完全佔據下來。由日本人居住。再把朝鮮的農民。調虎離山。移到我國的滿蒙。做他們墾殖的先鋒。其用心的隂險。的確勝人一籌、　　以上所說那些傾家蕩産的韓人。因受日人重利盤剥·金錢誘惑·弄得無家可歸。警察署依照户口的調查。把失業的人。一一登記。替他們謀出路。到了一定的時期。滿了相當的人數。便召集那班農民。宣佈移民的宗旨和計劃。然後派兵護送特備的專車。浩浩蕩蕩。都到滿蒙去墾殖。無智韓農。聆受了一番假仁假義的訓詞。居然表示滿意。認爲日本人能替他們想生路謀發展。那會知道給日本人侵佔財産。驅逐出境。當他們侵略滿蒙的先鋒。做了傀儡。自巳不知道。還要認賊作父。世界上那裏再有這樣蠢的民族。據說日本人對韓農宣佈移民的宗旨。開首便說。「你們真可憐。中國人把你們的滿蒙奪去了不知多少年。現在我們纔替你們收回來。這是多麽困難呀。大家好好去墾殖。愛護自家的土地。不要再讓中國人來欺侮。」唉。真是顛倒是非。淆亂黑白了。雖然很蠢的韓農。聽了這麽剌激的話。自然奮勇當前。向滿蒙去活動了。我們但看滿蒙方面韓農可驚的數目。更明瞭日本侵略的野心。日本人正高唱着所謂滿·蒙·鮮政策。把我們的滿·蒙。與朝鮮併爲一談。真是大笑話。我們的同胞呀。時機是危急了。大家起來救國吧。說部扶輪會？？？（二四）  徐卓呆　　小孩子一去，子良靜得多了，但是樓下的夫人，又在呌喚：　　「子良：」　　「做什麽？」　　「你可有人丹？」　　「誰要？」　　「是我。」　　子良聽了，怎麽可以不關心呢？　　「你怎麽啦？」　　「我有些難過！」　　「難過？快些上來！」　　夫人徐徐走上樓來，面色確是很難看，子良先呌伊躺在床上，然後拿七粒人丹，給伊吃了，再問：　　「是怎樣的難過？」　　夫人不語，用手指指胸口。　　「胸口不舒服。發悶？」　　月如點點頭，子良想起來了：　　「怕是老毛病！發肝氣！」　　伊似乎也承認是的。别的女子，發肝氣，總在動氣之後：月如女士發肝氣恰巧相反，偏偏在快活過度之後。子良一認定了伊的毛病，當然可以對症發藥：　　「我去拿沈香末子來給你吃罷！」　　夫人點點頭，子良在抽斗中，尋到一小包沈香末子，呌娘姨拿一杯開水來，伊一齊吃完。　　他又解開衣上的鈕子，用手指指胸口，子良明白了，每次月如發肝氣，萬一發得厲害，不能平靜時，子良便用手在伊胸口撫着，大約要撫幾百撫，方始會漸漸的不痛。　　子良先去取一隻小凳子來，坐在床前，然後用手在伊胸口撫着，先輕後重，先徐後急，此刻子良，早把學生的一百六十多本作文簿，一齊忘掉了。</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministry's Rebuttal to Japanese Note</h3>
<p>Chongguang Returned to Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Korean incident, the Foreign Ministry, after receiving the Japanese reply on the 15th, believes that the Japanese side is shirking responsibility. The reply regarding our demands for punishing the perpetrators, compensation, and ensuring that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again is extremely unsatisfactory. On the 16th, a document of rebuttal was prepared and delivered to Chongguang by officials from the Foreign Ministry at 4 PM. In addition to refuting the Japanese reply point by point, the previous demands for compensation, punishment of the perpetrators, and guarantees were reiterated, but the wording was more severe than the first protest. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chongguang will return to Shanghai by night train on the 16th. Foreign Minister Wang changed plans to go to Qingdao on the 18th. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

Zhong has been urgently summoned to Shenyang, and Ishi is also expected to arrive on schedule. Negotiations are not far off. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The Perpetrator Arrested on the Spot</p>

Next, Kim Ho-yeon, an investigator from the Korean Reformation Society, spoke about how since the Japanese Empire's invasion of Korea, their spirit and material possessions have been relentlessly suppressed by the Japanese. This time, with the Wan case, the Japanese used their habitual trick of instigating discord, stirring up the emotions of the Chinese and Korean people, causing a rift. Therefore, the occurrence of the Korean case is the fault of the Koreans, but the crime lies with the Japanese. He hopes that the Chinese will understand the Koreans. Finally, Qiu Shui, a representative of the overseas Chinese in Korea, reported the details of the massacre, proving that it was an outbreak of Japan's policy of invading Manchuria and Mongolia.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Research on the Northeast (2)</h3>
<p>Let us take two examples. A guest has a box, but never paid attention to what is stored inside. A neighbor watches it closely, looking for an opportunity to steal it. Over time, the neighbor knows everything stored in the box. Then, he simply grabs the box and claims it as his own. The guest fights back, but is defeated. He asks the neighbors for justice, but the neighbors cannot distinguish right from wrong. Then, they tell the guest to describe the contents of the box. He stares blankly and cannot answer. The thief promptly lists the number of clothes, books, and foreign coins, even the smallest items are not omitted. After opening the box and checking, there are no errors. To whom should the box be returned? We hardly need to think about it.</p>
<p>Or, a playboy buys a large book cover, its surface is gold and its characters are extremely beautiful. To show off, he places it on the table, but never reads it. Next to him is a poor man who cannot afford to buy books, so he secretly reads it. Over time, he recites every word of the book fluently. Then, although the playboy has the name of the book, in reality, it is entirely possessed by the secret reader.</p>
<p>The Northeast problem is the same. We have treasures, but do not know it. We have resources, but do not develop them. Japan and Russia are constantly watching from the side, but we are not aware of it. They deliberately use historical terms and call our Northeast the Manchurian-Mongolian world. All countries also call it Manchuria-Mongolia. Then, the sovereignty of our territory seems to be in doubt. The construction of the South Manchurian Railway network, the exploitation of the Fushun coal mines and heavy oil, the investment and operation of industry and commerce, the monopoly of the economy, and the seizure of agricultural products, animal husbandry, forests, and fisheries means that the actual benefits of our Northeast have all fallen into the hands of others.</p>
<p>We treat it like stubborn iron, while others use it like gold. Why? Because others know, but we are ignorant. Others seek to know, but we are indifferent and do not care. We have jewels, but abandon them in the wild. The violent seizure by the strong is inevitable. Who will help us if we call for help? This is like not knowing what is stored in the box. It is also like having a valuable book but never reading it.</p>
<p>Those who surround the Northeast are not only Japan and Russia, but especially Japan and Russia, because they are located closest and therefore plot against us most strongly. The Russo-Japanese War was a struggle for our Northeast. In recent years, our Northeast problem has become the focus of intense and lasting international disputes, which is also a struggle among the powers for our Northeast.</p>
<p>A Japanese person said, "Japan sacrificed itself for China in the Russo-Japanese War and protected the peace of Manchuria and Mongolia. Those who reject and doubt this are guilty of injustice!" He also said, "The special relationship between Japan and Russia regarding Manchuria and Mongolia cannot continue to coexist with Japan unless Manchuria and Mongolia are transferred to the Atlantic Ocean or disappear from the Earth. Even if God rises up and takes it away, it is impossible!" Their ambition for our Northeast is clearly depicted in these few words. To encourage their people to actively invade our Northeast, they often say that Japan's special rights in Manchuria were exchanged for blood taxes in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. They also made a table and hung it everywhere on the streets. The table shows:</p>
<p>Japan: 43,700 square miles, 85 million people</p>
<p>Manchuria: 65,000 square miles, 28 million people</p>
<p>The sinister intention is truly frightening. Mr. Huang Yanpei said in his Travelogue Around the Yellow Sea, "Next to the desks of their civil and military officials, they hang a large map of the new territories of Manchuria and Mongolia. When they are silent for a few minutes, they are thinking of Manchuria and Mongolia... they are the future of our country..." A few words truly contain countless tears of blood and infinite pain, which is a portrayal of the Japanese conspiracy and ambition.</p>
<p>Their plot against us for sixty years since the Meiji Restoration has been consistent. The Sino-Japanese War has already given our country a very serious warning. Yet, how is it that our people have been sleeping and dreaming for years and are not aware? Although it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, it is more practical and beneficial to quickly start researching and developing than to shed tears of blood and call for national salvation in vain.</p>

<h3>Inmate Reclamation Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The plan for inmate reclamation set by the Judicial Administration Yuan is divided into two types: (1) Improving execution methods and (2) Dredging the role of prisoners.

It is now planned to establish an intermediate prison system after mixed detention and before parole in order to achieve both improvement and dredging purposes.</p>

The second phase is to stipulate the location for land reclamation and then relocate. The location for land reclamation was started to be investigated in the 18th year, and those that have been investigated are Ningxia and other provinces. Criminal farms were contacted with the Land Bureau of this municipal government in the 19th year, but they were temporarily suspended due to undetermined funding. Regarding the execution method, it is still necessary to establish a progressive degree in general prisons and stipulate appropriate standards for the classification, grading, examination, supervision, and other methods of prisoners. The system roughly imitates the Irish system and the labor reform system of Soviet Russia. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>German Perseverance in the Face of Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Government Issues Four More Emergency Decrees</p>
<p>National Banks Reopen in Compliance</p>
<p>Speculation in Foreign Currency Prohibited</p>
<p>Difficulty Appears to be Overcome, Public Confidence Gradually Restored</p>
<p>Unconditional Reparations Paid as Due</p>
<p>Hundred Million Dollar Loan Extended for Three Months</p>
<p>Authorities Exert Themselves for the Nation, Neglecting Sleep and Meals</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th</h3>
<p>The important events today in the midst of Germany's financial turmoil are roughly as follows: (1) The discount rate of the Deutsche Bank has been increased from 7% to 10%, but lending has not been completely stopped. (2) The Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank simultaneously decided to reduce the cash reserve for banknotes to below the legal limit of 40%. According to the bank's charter, in an emergency, once the discount rate is raised to 10%, the cash reserve can be reduced below the legal limit, roughly to around 30%. However, according to the current situation, there are different interpretations of how low the minimum limit can be reduced. Some say it can be reduced to 25%, while others say that when the discount rate is 10%, it can only be reduced to 32%. The Board of Directors has not yet made a decision on this. It is estimated that approximately 1.2 billion marks in banknotes can be additionally issued. (3) The government has issued four more emergency decrees: (A) All banks will reopen on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but payments will be limited to wages and salaries that must be paid by industry and commerce. (B) Forward foreign currency transactions are prohibited on exchanges. (C) The prices of securities and bonds, etc., are prohibited from being quoted in foreign currency, except by national institutions such as the Deutsche Bank. (D) When banks reopen tomorrow and restrict payments, the public is strictly prohibited from causing disturbances or riots. (4) Germany has paid the unconditional reparations of 51 million marks due to France today to the Bank for International Settlements, which immediately lent it back to Germany. (5) The Vienna Merger Bank reopened yesterday, but with limited payments. (6) British banks will not honor checks from German banks or accept German banknotes until German banks return to normal, except for those with pre-arranged business relationships. (7) Cabinet members are neglecting sleep and meals, meeting all day. Since last Thursday, Brüning and the cabinet members have been working day and night, with hardly any time for rest, and very little time for meals. They can truly be said to be exerting themselves for the nation and the people.</p>
<p>Before the issuance of these emergency decrees, the people of the country were still in a state of fear and doubt. After the decrees were announced, they felt that there were no extremely urgent measures, so public confidence was slightly restored, and they knew that the cabinet had a definite plan to safely overcome the difficulties. Moreover, after various disturbances, it can be confirmed that Germany's national economic position is solid.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, 16th</h3>
<p>Germany started working this morning, in a state of optimism not seen for many days. The speeches of the cabinet members broadcast by the radio station in the middle of the night have had a good effect. The banks are heavily guarded by the police, and reopened in the morning, with sufficient funds to meet the needs of industrial payrolls. However, within a few hours of opening, the number of withdrawals was not as high as expected, so the issue of bank runs is no longer a problem. There is a growing consensus in political circles on the idea of providing France with some kind of political guarantee, such as the construction of a second battlecruiser. However, in order to prevent internal strife within the cabinet, the construction of the battlecruiser or the cancellation of the German-Austrian customs union cannot be completely abandoned.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, 15th</h3>
<p>The German government's emergency decree is lengthy and very detailed. It stipulates that banks will only pay out funds needed to maintain the country's economic life on July 16th, 17th, and 18th, such as wages, alimony, and taxes. Debtors who are unable to fulfill their obligations due to this order will be protected by the government. Speculation in foreign currency is prohibited, and other foreign currency transactions will be handled exclusively by the national bank. The exchange rate in Berlin will be used as the standard for the whole country. For foreign currencies for which there is no exchange rate in Berlin, their buying and selling will be converted into marks at the most recent official price. Those who violate the foreign currency regulations will be punished with imprisonment and fines of up to ten times the amount, and all their foreign currency, even if it is not their own, will be confiscated by the state. The publication of speculative reports on securities, foreign currency, and the mark exchange rate is prohibited. Short selling of metals such as copper and lead is also prohibited, with violators subject to imprisonment and fines. As for the disclosure of market prices, it is forbidden to publish any information other than the official foreign currency exchange rate in Germany. It is forbidden to trade in foreign currency futures or gold and silver futures in German currency. The Minister of Economic Affairs has the right to demand from anyone information, documents, and sworn statements regarding their foreign currency transactions. Today, a number of insignificant disturbances occurred in several towns in Germany, as gatherings of unemployed people organized by the Communist Party were prohibited by the police. The Communist Party distributed leaflets in Frankfurt, inciting the looting of banks. Several party members were arrested, and the police dispersed the Communist Party's public gathering and arrested several people. Similar demonstrations took place in Düsseldorf and other places, but were dispersed by the police. Except for a few shots fired in Leipzig and Dresden, the police only used batons to deal with the crowds.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th</h3>
<p>After the government issued four emergency decrees, it is now said that former National Bank President Schacht has been appointed as the currency commissioner. This may be an unavoidable step to consolidate the German currency system. When the Ruhr region was occupied, Schacht issued Rentenmark banknotes to maintain finance. Any speculators who intended to disrupt the plan were dealt with resolutely by Schacht, and no one dared to violate it lightly. At that time, Luther was serving as Minister of Finance, and the two worked together effectively. Therefore, if Schacht can make a comeback today and work with the current President of the National Bank, Luther, to save the mark, the results will be doubled with half the effort.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th</h3>
<p>According to official reports, the conditional reparations due today have not been paid, but the unconditional reparations under the Young Plan that are due each month have been transferred to the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, but immediately returned in the same amount, because the Hoover Moratorium has been implemented with the tacit consent of all countries. Furthermore, the 100 million gold dollar loan that was due tomorrow and had already been extended by the Bank for International Settlements has now been extended for three months.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th</h3>
<p>A German government official told an Associated Press reporter that the German government recognizes that President Hoover's one-year moratorium on war debts has been effectively implemented. The cabinet initially decided to postpone the payment of the unconditional reparations of 51 million marks due today in the midst of the financial crisis, but then changed its mind and still paid it to the Bank for International Settlements. Both Britain and Italy have recently announced that they will not accept unconditional reparations. The French government also told the US Ambassador to France, Edge, on Tuesday that it no longer hopes for Germany to pay reparations in the midst of the financial crisis. However, Belgium has not yet made any statement regarding the reparations due. The issue of Germany's delivery of goods and the issue of Germany's railway bonds to be paid to the international bank will be resolved at the London expert meeting.</p>
<p>British and American Leaders Meet in Paris</p>
<p>British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary's Trip to Berlin Cancelled</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 15th</h3>
<p>This afternoon's gazette stated that French Foreign Minister Briand hosted Henderson today. Participants included the French Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and key foreign affairs officials. They discussed various issues, paying particular attention to the German panic. They scheduled to continue the talks tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Paris, 15th</h3>
<p>US Secretary of State Stimson arrived in Paris from Rome at 2:00 PM today. At 5:00 PM, he drove to visit French Foreign Minister Briand. Briand summarized France's opposition to further military disarmament, arguing that the issue of disarmament cannot be separated from European political issues. Political issues must be resolved first, and then disarmament can be addressed. He also summarized the military and economic status of the Soviet Union and its relationship with France and the world. Afterwards, Stimson visited British Foreign Secretary Henderson.</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 16th</h3>
<p>It is heard that the government has solicited opinions from military authorities at home and in overseas autonomous territories on the extent to which imperial armaments can be reduced. Most seem to believe that they can be reduced by 50% over the next five to ten years, but the reduction should not exceed 10% in any one year. Now that the economic panic has spread across the globe, leading to a reduction in British income and an increase in unemployment, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had to seek ways to reduce government spending. This is why the government has taken this step. It is heard that efforts will be made to immediately reduce at least 10%, but the success of this proposal will depend on other countries following suit. Now that British Foreign Secretary Henderson is visiting France, coinciding with the arrival of US Secretary of State Stimson in Paris, his trip is being highly valued because of the austerity in military spending.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Paris, 16th</h3>
<p>The trip to Berlin by British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Henderson has been cancelled. The news was met with surprise. German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius will both come here tomorrow. British Foreign Secretary Henderson will meet with them. The reason for the sudden change of plans is the development after the meeting of Henderson, Laval, and Stimson. The three officials were unanimous in their opinion that it is now urgent to find ways to help Germany and prevent it from going bankrupt. They are now urging Germany not to miss this rare opportunity to preserve the country, promote Franco-German friendship, and clear the heavy atmosphere in Europe. Therefore, they plan to ask Germany to provide financial and political guarantees and borrow a large sum of money. In order to avoid Germany having feelings of humiliation, it has been agreed that the League of Nations should be the trustee in charge.</p>
<p>Expert Meeting Convened Today</p>
<p>Cabinet Meetings of Various Countries to Follow</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 15th</h3>
<p>The British Foreign Office stated that the British government has decided that it is now necessary to convene leading officials from various countries to immediately hold a meeting to discuss the issues arising from the implementation of President Hoover's Moratorium under the Young Plan. The meeting should be held in London, and the time should be 6:00 PM on July 20th, because the expert committee from each country will gather on the 17th, and the 20th will be available for inquiries from the senior officials. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary will go to Berlin on the 17th, stay for a short time, and then return to London in time to attend the senior officials' meeting. An invitation will now be issued. Reuters received a dispatch from Paris stating that the French government and its financial advisors are now considering the method of Germany's request. The French government believes that when considering Germany's request, there must be extreme caution. Germany should provide tangible guarantees that express its goodwill. This must be decided by the financial authorities of the countries concerned. In particular, if the German economy is to recover, its politics must be stable. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, Acting Secretary of State Castle issued an important statement today, saying that the United States does not want to be involved in any political situation when funding Germany. The Federal Reserve Bank, apart from cooperating with central banks of various countries, including the French bank, does not want to consider any loans to Germany. He also said that the banks of the world must be certain that Germany is currently doing its best to reorganize its country, and then the United States can consider ways to help. Currently, major banks in New York have decided to accept drafts from German banks.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 16th</h3>
<p>This year, the German government issued a public statement declaring that the government has accepted the British invitation to attend the conference of countries related to reparations opening in London next Monday.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th</h3>
<p>After receiving a telegram from the British government inviting it to send personnel to participate in the London cabinet meeting of various countries on the 20th of this month, the Japanese government decided to send Ambassador to London Matsudaira as its representative to attend.</p>
<h3>Reuters, New York, 16th</h3>
<p>Political circles here are enthusiastically supporting the British initiative to convene a cabinet meeting of various countries, believing that this is a much-needed step today. Through this, France and Germany can eliminate old grievances and be friendly to each other. President Hoover also believes that this is the key to the entire issue of European economic recovery and disarmament.</p>
<p>France Affected by German Financial Crisis</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Paris, 15th</h3>
<p>Although France has a large gold reserve, it is inevitably affected by the German financial crisis. This is entirely due to the unwillingness to actively assist Germany. After the stock exchange opened today, prices plummeted, which has rarely been seen in recent years. The stock exchange was closed for the national holiday on Monday and Tuesday. When it opened today, the mood was very bad. The shares of French banks fell by as much as 20 pounds. The shares of the National Bank were almost impossible to price in the first few hours. At closing, the price was more than 40 pounds lower than in the morning. Although other securities did not fall as much as bank shares, they also fell significantly.</p>
<p>German Foreign Trade Declines</p>
<h3>Reuters, Berlin, 16th</h3>
<p>Official statistics for the first half of 1931 show that Germany's foreign trade has declined significantly due to the global economic recession and the increased tariffs in many countries. Although both German imports and exports have decreased, the surplus for the half-year reached 818,000,000 marks. If the goods on the reparations account are included, exports exceeded imports by a total of 1,068,000,000 marks. This German surplus is mostly due to the reduction in imports, which is due to the weak purchasing power of the people. In the past six months, the average monthly imports were 634,000,000 marks, compared to 866,100,000 marks last year. The average monthly exports were 794,700,000 marks, compared to 1,003,000,000 marks last year.</p>
<p>Russia and France Restore Trade</p>
<p>Embargo Order Revoked on the Same Day</p>
<h3>Reuters, Paris, 15th</h3>
<p>Russia and France will each issue orders tomorrow to cancel previous orders mutually excluding goods. On October 3rd of last year, France issued an order restricting the import of certain Russian goods to prevent dumping. On the 20th of that month, Russia issued an order restricting the import of French goods in retaliation. Since then, there has been no trade between the two countries. Now, they are each canceling their previous orders and planning a new trade agreement.</p>
<p>Mexican Government Orders Ban on Foreign Workers Entering the Country</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Mexico City, 15th</h3>

<h3>Telegram from Harbin</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: Since Uchida succeeded as President of the South Manchuria Railway and Ugaki became Governor-General of Korea, Japan's traditional continental policy has become increasingly sharp. The Korean people of Wanbaoshan, Jilin, forcibly excavated people's fields and opened waterways without permission. This was initially just a local problem, and could have been resolved legally if there was no intention to provoke. However, the Japanese made a mountain out of a molehill, first sending armed police to forcibly work, then shooting at nearby residents, and recently reversing the facts, fabricating black and white, and inciting ignorant Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese in Korea and attack Chinese consulates. The Japanese police turned a blind eye and did not stop them. Overseas Chinese sent urgent telegrams, which were all withheld, resulting in countless innocent overseas Chinese dying and being injured, with no way to survive and no way to avoid death. This is sinister and brutal, not only violating treaties, but also contrary to humanity. It is hoped that the Party and the national authorities will seriously negotiate and not make any concessions. All demands to stop the Korean riots, withdraw the Japanese police from Wanbaoshan, stop all illegal actions, and issue a formal apology should be insisted on to the end. As for the severe punishment of the culprits, the investigation and prosecution of the responsible police authorities, compensation for damages, condolences for the dead and wounded, and guarantees that such incidents will not happen again in the future, we should also fight to the death. If the Japanese try to evade their responsibilities with sophistry, our people should unite as one and plan together how to deal with them. We will not hesitate to make any sacrifices, and we vow to curb their ambitions and avenge our humiliation. The telegram is filled with utmost anticipation. Harbin Chamber of Commerce, Binjiang Industrial and Commercial Association, Education Association of the Special District of Eastern Provinces, Harbin Municipal Self-Government Association, Harbin Lawyers Association, Binjiang Municipal Lawyers Association, and all people's organizations respectfully request deletion.</p>
<h3>Harbin Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: The Japanese are instigating Korean farmers to illegally excavate civilian land and forcibly dig ditches in the Wanbaoshan area of Changchun. This has completely cut off the navigation and transportation of the Yitong River, and over 20 li of fertile farmland has been illegally damaged. When local authorities intervened to stop them, Japanese Consul Tashima openly dispatched armed police to protect the work. Nearby residents, compelled by righteous indignation, gathered to protest. The Japanese police then opened fire, spraying bullets, and subsequently deployed machine guns, constructing fortifications, forcibly occupying our homes, and expelling our residents, creating a veritable state of war. Their arrogance is rampant, treating Chinese as less than cattle, horses, slaves, and regarding our complete territory as their secondary colony. Yet, they still seem unsatisfied, fabricating rumors, distorting the truth, inciting Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese in Korea, attacking the Seoul consulate, destroying shops, and insulting the national dignity. The situation is more tragic, and the losses of life and property are greater than in 1927. Humanitarian concepts and treaty effectiveness are completely destroyed. Japanese military police, usually more than capable of appeasing Korean people, have turned a blind eye to this tragedy, strongly suggesting covert instigation. It is evident that the initiation of both cases represents a new attempt at Japan's traditional continental policy. All our countrymen should rise up together and jointly devise countermeasures. We especially hope that the diplomatic authorities will make a firm decision and engage in serious negotiations. Regarding the massacre of overseas Chinese by Korean people, we should demand that the Japanese side suppress the riots, severely punish the perpetrators, investigate and hold accountable the responsible officials and police. Regarding the Wanbaoshan case, we should demand that the Japanese side cease work, withdraw military police, restore the land to its original state, and punish the Japanese consul in Changchun. Furthermore, they must separately and formally apologize to us, provide compensation for the injured and deceased, compensate for damages, guarantee the future safety of overseas Chinese, and ensure that similar incidents never occur again. If the Japanese side acknowledges their wrongdoing and fulfills these demands item by item, then after both cases are satisfactorily resolved, we can then thoroughly reorganize the nationality of Korean residents and formulate new Sino-Korean trade and protection measures to provide a fundamental solution. If the Japanese side evades responsibility and makes excuses, then our entire nation can only unite and adopt all necessary means for national self-defense. If unforeseen events arise as a result, all responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. With national crisis looming and unbearable humiliation to be avenged, we hope that all comrades and compatriots at home and abroad will, with a shared sense of national survival, unite in will and vow to resist to the death. The Party and the nation are fortunate. The Harbin Special Commissioner's Office of the Kuomintang Party Affairs pays its respects in the cold.</p>
<h3>Yantai Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: The Japanese imperialists have always regarded our country as their major market for commodity sales and a source of industrial raw materials. Apart from making every effort to invade our country, they have no way to resolve their crisis. The outbreak of the Wanbaoshan and Korean massacres is truly a manifestation of their ultimate intentions being revealed. The most effective way for our nation to resist is through economic severance and the promotion of domestic goods. The Yantai City Assembly has passed a resolution to appoint representatives to be responsible for preparing and organizing an anti-Japanese association, and has submitted a request to the central government to reduce the tax rate on domestic goods. We hope that everyone will rise up together and cooperate fully, so that industry can be revitalized and national hatred can be avenged. This is specially telegraphed for your information. Awaiting your clear instructions. The Yantai All-Circles Wanbaoshan and Korean Massacre Diplomatic Support Association pays its respects.</p>

<p>To all newspaper offices: Disaster befalls our Henan Province, with calamities occurring in succession. For over ten days, the water vapor has been turbulent. Southern areas such as Xinyang, Luoshan, Gushi, Xiping, Zhengyang, Xichuan, and Yexian counties have suffered from continuous rain. Eastern areas such as Yancheng, Xihua, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, and Linying residents have also experienced distress. Sinking stone rhinoceros statues proved ineffective, and throwing white horses yielded no success. Piling earth was difficult to block the breach in Mengjin, and it was like a gourd pouring water. The old and weak were reduced to fish and turtles, and children's songs echoed the Shangyang omen. Li Wo reported that damage to crops exceeded 18%, and Zhu Ao's review showed that damaged fields were no less than 3,000. Frogs climbed onto rooftops, and bees built nests in white stoves. Relocating over 20,000 households from mounds and hills presents the risk of empty cauldrons. Dispatching 500 Henan grain ships still lacks funds for boats. Banks turn into valleys, and water floods into cities. Cries shake the sky, and floating corpses fill the fields. After receiving the report, Zhi Yu planned to personally inspect the situation on the first ten days of this month. Upon arriving at the Yellow River, heavy rain poured down, creating a vast expanse of water. The road was blocked and long, forcing an unwilling return to Bian on the true day, urgently seeking a way to provide relief. However, years of war have made providing assistance difficult, and encountering sudden disasters has exhausted resources. Currently, officials are donating their salaries to feed the hungry, but there is no way to turn stone into gold, and they can only sigh helplessly. In addition to ordering the county magistrates to supervise the township directors to quickly dredge accumulated water to rescue disaster victims, and sending telegrams to call for aid, and submitting separate reports, we humbly request that your Excellency consider the frequent disasters and public and private exhaustion in Henan Province, and quickly allocate large sums of money to provide urgent relief. We also implore governments of all provinces and cities and charitable organizations to share your compassionate efforts and save the surviving people. We await your command with utmost respect. Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, and Commissioners Zhang Fang, Wan Wu, Zhang Feiran, Li Jingzhai, Liu Yaoyang, and Qi Zhenru pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Secretariat of the Jiangxi Provincial Government</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: Recently, I read reports in various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai regarding the case of Yang Mianzhong, Director of the Finance Department of this province, allegedly soliciting bribes from Zhu Shifang to seek appointment as Director of the Slaughter Bureau. Many of these reports are inaccurate. I will briefly outline the process of this case. Due to the intense suppression of bandits in this province and severe financial shortages, former Director Huang resigned, and the Central Government appointed Commissioner Yang Mianzhong concurrently. On the third day of last month, Director Yang arrived at the office. The next day, Yan Beijian, a former staff member of the provincial government, reported that Zhu Shifang was willing to bribe 10,000 yuan to buy the position of Director of the Slaughter Bureau. Director Yang then instructed him to feign agreement, and reported to Chairman Lu, who forwarded the report to Chairman He of the Jiangxi Local Reorganization Committee for review. As the case involved bribery, it was deemed necessary to first obtain evidence of the crime in order to thoroughly investigate it. After receiving instructions, Director Yang immediately obtained the evidence, arrested Zhu Shifang, and submitted the case to the chairman for approval to be transferred to the court for trial. He also reported the matter to the provincial government meetings before and after. This is the background of the case. On the fourth day of this month, the Nanchang District Court suddenly sent a copy of the prosecutor's indictment, which was simultaneously distributed to various newspapers by the court. Upon careful examination of the indictment, it was found that Director Yang was accused of soliciting bribes, essentially treating all of Director Yang's actions during the investigation as criminal behavior, neglecting all the facts that occurred beforehand. Director Yang then submitted a report detailing the process of the case, requesting that he be suspended from his duties pending an investigation by a representative appointed by the Executive Yuan. The chairman submitted this to the 381st provincial government meeting, which resolved to (1) retain Director Yang in his position and submit the details of the case to the President of the Executive Yuan for review, and (2) send the government's handling of this case and the three previous records to the High Court for transmission to the Nanchang District Court for detailed investigation. These resolutions were separately handled and filed. Chairman He also sent a telegram to the government stating that he had already telegraphed the court to provide evidence. Furthermore, the High Court responded that it had ordered the Nanchang District Court to handle the case according to the law. This is the recent handling of the case. Fearing distant rumors, we specially telegraph this to be included in the news column to clarify the truth. The Secretariat of the Jiangxi Provincial Government pays its respects.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Telegram</h3>
<p>To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: On July 14th, your newspaper published a news item regarding the Central Education Fund, stating that the Labor University, which was to be closed, received 50,000 yuan per month, and that the funds were temporarily allocated for other educational facilities. Upon investigation, the Ministry has not reallocated the funds from the Labor University to other uses during this reorganization. What your newspaper reported is inconsistent with the facts. We especially telegraph to request a correction. The Ministry of Education pays its respects.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Telegram</h3>
<p>To the editor of the Shen Bao: I am extremely astonished to read two reports in your newspaper on the date with the G designation regarding the change of the president of the Northern Anhui Daily. Since Mr. Tang Shaolan took office as the president of our newspaper, his achievements have been outstanding. Recently, he resigned due to illness, and various circles in Bengbu have been giving him farewell banquets for days. However, reactionary elements here, who were exposed by our newspaper, harbored resentment in their hearts and did not hesitate to fabricate accusations to harm him. In addition to submitting a request to the Anhui Provincial Party Department for thorough investigation, we specially telegraph to request a correction. The Bengbu Northern Anhui Daily pays its respects.</p>

<p>All of these topics are the focus of discussions at this conference. In the past, our country's representatives at the meetings have strived to resist and defend the dignity of the country. We are deeply respectful of this spirit. However, when presenting the situation in our country, the presentation of facts and the narration of various statistical figures still lack sufficient research of materials. Since the fourth conference is to be held in our country, our country's representatives should be fully prepared to show the true face of the new China to the representatives of various countries, so that they have a correct understanding and knowledge of us. We deeply hope that scholars in our country can express more insightful comments on the above issues for the reference of the conference, so that all issues can get accurate and satisfactory conclusions.</p>
<p>In recent months, criticisms of the Pacific International Institute have been heard from all over our country. Some say that the association is a spokesperson for imperialist powers, while others believe that the association is a new group that deceives and oppresses weak nations. The Eastern Problems Research Association, the Asian Cultural Association, and local Kuomintang party departments have all risen up in opposition. Public opinion in various places has also been critical of the association. There is no smoke without fire. This kind of opposition to the conference is probably not due to intentional misunderstanding or trouble-making by the Chinese people, but is actually due to the excessive negative impression that the previous conference gave to the Chinese people. Recalling the previous conference, when discussing the issue of the three northeastern provinces and China's diplomatic issues, the representatives of various countries mostly ignored the statements of our country's representatives. Britain maintained strict silence, and the United States was devoted to mediation. In particular, the Japanese representative directly acknowledged that all of Japan's rights in the three northeastern provinces were deserved. The forceful arguments and excuses made for his government in several discussions inside and outside the meeting completely lost the attitude of a scholar and the sincerity of friendship. Because of the Japanese representative's gaffe, domestic public opinion changed completely after the closing of the third conference. Those who had hoped for and praised the association turned to curses and defamation. This is the sole responsibility of the Japanese representative and something that representatives of all countries should pay close attention to in the future. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Changchun Municipal Government Urges Japanese Police to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Again Seriously Protests to the Japanese Consul</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Japanese Side Should Bear Full Responsibility for All Disputes and Incidents</p>
<p>The Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office has protested to the Japanese side twice regarding the Wanbaoshan conflict incident. The Japanese side has not implemented them, but continues to build trenches and barracks, and make military preparations. Therefore, it has recently protested seriously to the resident Japanese consul in Changchun. The original text is as follows: "To Whom It May Concern, in our official letters No. 191 and No. 192 of July 2nd, we requested that your side withdraw all Japanese police stationed in Wanbaoshan immediately, and that the police officers who opened fire on farmers in legitimate self-defense be given appropriate punishment, so as to avoid further complications and further increase the responsibility that your side should bear. We have repeatedly sent personnel to discuss and urge your side to implement this, but it has not been implemented to this day. Furthermore, we have received repeated reports that the Japanese police dispatched by your side are forcibly occupying many civilian houses and ferry boats on the Yitong River, hindering the farming and transportation of nearby farmers, and arbitrarily cutting down the willow groves along the shore for the purpose of building dams, and arbitrarily digging trenches and burying bombs and landmines. These are just a few examples. The legal issue in civil affairs is fundamentally no longer valid, and your side intends to use force as a backing to carry out malicious acts of violence and coercion. It is deeply regrettable that your consul is openly the instigator of these illegal acts. Upon investigation, your side's intention is only to focus on the development of the future of Korean farming, but you never consider the impact of coercing Chinese farmers with violence and its consequences, which are counterproductive. What you call wanting to benefit them is actually harming them. Furthermore, in this Wanbaoshan incident, your side refuses to follow the correct path to resolve it, and instead wants to use the expulsion of Chinese residents in Korean areas as a means of coercion. The repercussions of this will inevitably lead to a backlash against the expulsion of Korean residents in the eastern provinces. There are only tens of thousands of Chinese in Korean areas, but there are actually hundreds of thousands of Koreans in the eastern provinces. Which side will suffer more from mutual expulsion? This is something that must be carefully considered. In Wanbaoshan alone, your side's armed police force is already stretched to the limit. If incidents occur everywhere in the future as a result of the backlash, how will your side handle the aftermath? Furthermore, the machine gun police force ordered by your consul is only intended to threaten farmers and force them to submit to illegal infringements. Using machine guns to infringe on the inherent and legitimate sovereignty of farmers is like bandit-style illegal behavior. The results cannot be guaranteed by legal security. In the minds of farmers, bandits in groups of hundreds may be temporarily coerced, but will eventually naturally flee. They have seen this happen often and have considered it carefully. How can they submit? In the past, your side sent troops to Siberia, deploying tens of thousands of soldiers for several years, spending 2 billion yuan, but gained nothing. The machine gun police force currently dispatched is only a drop in the bucket. How can it deter Chinese farmers who are justified and determined? If your side does not realize this in the end, there will be a final solution. Otherwise, withdraw all police officers immediately and resolve this case based on legal principles and justice, with a long-term vision, in order to ensure the fundamental safety of the current Koreans in all parts of the eastern provinces. If you must incite increasingly expanding reactions, then your side will bear full responsibility for all disputes and incidents that occur, as well as the losses suffered by our landlords and farmers, according to our previous formal and serious statements. This letter is sent again. Please investigate. To Tashiro, Japanese Consul in Changchun, from Zhou, Chief of the Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office."</p>
<p>Documents on Sino-Japanese Negotiations in the Wanbaoshan Case (3)</p>
<h3>Letter from the Japanese Consul to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, regarding the dispute over paddy fields near Wanbaoshan, Changchun, the results of the joint investigation by our two sides have been discussed in detail in recent face-to-face meetings. (1) Regarding the concern of the farmers that the Yitong River dam construction may flood the farmland along the upper reaches, our side is difficult to acknowledge. The height of the dam is about eight feet from the riverbed. The river is usually about three feet deep, and the part of the dam that is exposed above the water is about five feet. Even if the water rises, it will only rise this much. The height of the banks near the dam is about thirteen or four feet above the water surface on the right bank, and the height is the same as the right bank on the left bank, even though it is a sloping field. Therefore, the field on both sides is not considered to be flooded during normal times. In addition, the height of the dam is only eight feet from the riverbed as mentioned earlier. Even if the amount of water increases due to rainfall, it will flow downstream from the upper part of the dam. Therefore, the concern that the vast area of thousands of hectares on both sides will be flooded is never taken into account. Moreover, if there is a risk of flooding on both sides due to heavy rainfall, the Koreans will inevitably remove the dam. The floods in 1920 and 1923 were irresistible natural disasters, and this dam construction is not a problem. (2) Regarding the obstruction of shipping on the Yitong River, the Mudanjiang River can be used as an example. Navigation of boats and rafts is unimpeded. It is believed that the Koreans will not only have a way to avoid hindering the shipping on the river, but also will not hinder the traffic at the rafting site at the dam. (3) A generous reward (three shi of rice per hectare) is planned for the landowners of the waterway, and wooden bridges will be erected on the transportation routes to avoid obstructing traffic. However, your side claims that this matter has not been agreed to by the landowners. In that case, this is the mistake of the intermediary, and the responsibility does not lie with the Koreans. Since the occurrence of this incident, this official has always adhered to the principle of amicable resolution based on the usual friendly relations between our two countries. For example, on May 25, your country's public security team beat a Korean and intended to detain one. At that time, it was believed that your side must have sincerity, so the matter was handled at will and no questions were asked. However, on the first day of this month, our side forcibly detained ten Koreans by the public security team, and only then did a few plainclothes police officers go to the scene. This was not a military confrontation, but was to protect the Koreans. Later, when the planting season was approaching, your side's proposal for a joint investigation was approved in order to resolve the issue, and the police were withdrawn and the Koreans stopped working. All of these measures showed our side's goodwill and peaceful intentions. However, from the beginning, not only did your side fail to listen to our side's negotiations for a satisfactory resolution, but also intended to use force to make the Koreans leave. As the way to a satisfactory resolution has been gradually approaching in recent days, the claim that the act of the Korean farmers is illegal is still based on the reasons of infringing on land ownership and the opposition of farmers. However, the Korean farmers did not start the construction with malicious intent. Even if this is not understood by the landowners, it is caused by the fraudulent behavior of the intermediary. If the truth is told, it is very sympathetic. Therefore, the Korean farmers will definitely compensate for the legitimate damages of the landowners. It is deeply hoped that your director will find a way to alleviate the resentment, because the poor and weak Korean farmers have already made up their minds to die, and have abandoned their hard-earned funds. If they are ordered to stop the work that is about to be completed, the general public opinion will say that your country is oppressing the Koreans, and it is feared that public sentiment will be excited and uncontrollable. However, this matter is originally a local case, but due to your side's inappropriate measures, it has become a major issue attracting attention everywhere. Moreover, in the current Manchuria, inauspicious Sino-Japanese incidents are occurring one after another. In this problem of the Sansingpu farm, it is even more hoped that your director will handle it carefully, so as not to turn it into something inauspicious. A corresponding letter is hereby issued for your investigation and consideration. To Zhou, Director of the Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office, from Tashiro Shigenori, Resident Consul in Changchun, June 13.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Japanese Consul to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, regarding the paddy field work at the Sansingpu farm, it has been detailed in official document No. 40. Here is a list of matters considered beneficial to your country's farmers, for the material to inform the farmers. A corresponding letter is hereby issued for your investigation and consideration. To Zhou, Director of the Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office, June 13. (A) In terms of benefits, the barren land of 500 hectares that has not been harvested in the past will become upper-class land. Normally, it can produce 7,500 shi of rice per year, which can be obtained at a market price of 52,500 yuan (7 yuan per shi). (B) For the paddy field landowners, 1,000 shi of rent can be obtained (2 shi per hectare). Converted at the market price, there is a profit of 7,000 yuan (calculated at 7 yuan per shi). (C) For the land used for waterways, the rent is 3 shi per hectare for the upper-class land, totaling 21 yuan (7 yuan per shi). For barren land, the rent is 2 shi per hectare, totaling 14 yuan. (D) The extension of the upper-class land of the waterway is 4,320 gian, and the land on both sides is about 1,400 hectares. Because there is a drainage ditch, if soybeans are planted, 560 shi can be obtained (an increase of 1 shi per hectare). Converted at the market price, the increased income is 19,300 yuan. 15 hectares of barren land can also be reclaimed into cultivated land. If soybeans are planted, 75 shi (5 shi per hectare) can be obtained, with a profit of 1,050 yuan.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Municipal Government to the Japanese Consul</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, We have received and respectfully read your official documents No. 40 and No. 41 of June 13. The incident of Korean residents reclaiming paddy fields and forcibly digging waterways in Wanbaoshan is purely a matter of illegal waterway construction and infringement on the legitimate and inherent rights of landowners and farmers. Moreover, the waterway and dam construction obstruct both shipping and</p>

<h3>News Highlights</h3>
<p>The extreme opposition of landlords and farmers to the "Regulations for the Management of Paddy Field Water Conservancy in Jilin Province," promulgated by the Jilin Provincial Government on July 17th, 1929, as per the Jilin Provincial Government Gazette, specifically Article 8, which states, "Those who cultivate paddy fields on a large scale must report to the local county government, which will then forward the report to the Department of Construction for verification and record," Article 11, which states, "Water diversion must be carried out according to the terrain, and rivers must not be dammed to block water flow," Article 12, which states, "New paddy field households or households converting dry land to paddy fields must report to the local county government three months before the water usage period if they need to dig new water diversion ditches, and construction shall only be permitted after verification that there is no obstruction," and Article 13, which states, "Paddy field ditches must be within one's own land, and if water diversion ditches outside the paddy fields must occupy private land, the local county government must be reported to for verification and valuation before purchase is allowed for use," and Hao Yongde's collaboration with Koreans and others in cultivating paddy fields regarding water issues, the procedure of official verification, permission, valuation, and purchase has not been followed according to current laws and regulations. Instead, the Koreans have forcibly dug up other people's fertile fields as waterways, which is illegal. This has been strongly opposed by local landlords and farmers. After both parties sent representatives for a joint investigation, the conclusion was that there was indeed an obstruction, and further work should not be allowed to continue. The details were provided in this office's public letters No. 158 of June 11th and No. 159 of June 12th, which were requested for your review. Now, with the receipt of documents No. 40 and No. 41 of June 13th, expressing hope that our side will find a way to alleviate the resentment of the local landlords and farmers, if it were feasible, this office would certainly make every effort to accommodate. However, the points explained in the documents do not align with the real reasons for the landlords' and farmers' opposition. Today, this office summoned the representatives of all parties to announce the intent of the documents. They claimed that while the land occupied by the waterways could be compensated for on a per-mu basis, the extension of the waterways for over twenty li would cut each household's original contiguous fertile fields into two sections. Even with multiple bridges in between, the contiguous farmland could not be fully restored. The laborers and farming tools of dozens of households would have to travel back and forth several times a day, having to go around the newly built bridges. Not only would there be detours, but also additional paths would have to be made, damaging fertile fields and causing disputes. This would be the case everywhere, for everyone, every day, increasing the consumption of time and labor. How could impoverished farmers, making a living through hard work, bear such permanent and unlimited losses? Furthermore, building dams across the Yitong River and cutting off the water flow not only obstructs navigation and transportation but also hinders the livelihoods of boatmen. This is prohibited by current laws and regulations. Moreover, as stated, the average depth from the riverbed to the water surface is about three chi. This time, the proposed water dam would be eight chi high from the riverbed. The fertile fields on the sloping left bank would suddenly increase by five chi or more in elevation. How could the thousands of mu of fertile fields on the sloping left bank not be directly and permanently subjected to endless water damage? This matter concerns the livelihoods and lives of thousands of farmers, both old and young, male and female. Based on the above reasons, they vowed to resist illegal infringement to the death and requested the responsible parties to restore the original state as soon as possible and compensate for the damages. The claims made by the representatives are consistent with the results of the previous joint investigation. A corresponding reply is hereby provided for your review. Furthermore, since this case has been agreed upon by both parties for the mutual withdrawal of police, the cessation of work by the Koreans, and a peaceful resolution after a joint investigation, this communication also declares adherence to this principle. Yesterday, your consul inquired at this office about why plainclothes Japanese police officers had resumed going to the area. We were informed that it was to instruct the Koreans not to work and to await resolution to avoid conflict with the farmers. However, according to the report from Changchun County, today, eight hundred Koreans resumed work, using willow branches to weave screens and baskets in preparation for damming the river. Twelve plainclothes Japanese police officers were maintaining order. The people are extremely indignant and request that you negotiate for a halt to this, to resolve the matter peacefully according to the previous agreement, so as to avoid conflict. Over the past two days, the situation has suddenly diverged, making it difficult to understand. Ultimately, does your side's intention still adhere to the principle of peaceful resolution, or is it as stated in this office's letter No. 159 of June 12th, willing to bear all responsibility? We hope for a detailed and considered response. Addressed to Japanese Consul Tadashi in Changchun, June 14th (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Li Zhonggang Goes to Pyongyang to Investigate the Truth of the Korean Incident</h3>
<p>A Letter from Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country to Fellow Countrymen</p>
<p>Pyongyang Correspondence: The General Consulate and Chamber of Commerce in Gyeongseong (Seoul) dispatched Li Zhonggang, along with Zheng Weifen and others, to Pyongyang to investigate the tragic state of the Korean riots. Upon arrival in Pyongyang, Li and his party were greeted by the Provincial Governor and the Police Chief, who invited them to a large restaurant for a conversation lasting about an hour, intending to delay the time. Li Zhonggang and his party stated that they wanted to see the situation for themselves. The Provincial Governor asked where they wanted to go to investigate. Li stated that they wanted to visit the refugee shelters and hospitals, investigate the destroyed homes of overseas Chinese, and examine the corpses. The Provincial Governor said that it was too dangerous outside and they should not go for the time being. Li stated that no matter how dangerous it was, they would definitely go, and even if the police did not protect them, they would still go. After repeated urging, the police finally led the way. Upon arrival at the refugee shelter, they saw over four thousand male refugees and over one thousand two hundred female refugees. As soon as they saw Li and his party, the female refugees rushed forward, hugging their legs and crying incessantly, and the male refugees also began to cry loudly. At this time, the police pointed their box-shaped pistols at the refugees, ordering them to step back. Li stated, "What are you doing?" The police replied, "I fear they will riot." Li said, "How could they riot?" The police then retreated a few steps. The chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Pyongyang, looking like a beggar, stepped forward and grabbed Li, preventing him from leaving. The scene was so tragic that even the most cold-hearted person would shed tears. After repeated consolation from Li and his party, they finally left. The scene at the hospital was even more tragic. They saw wounded refugees lying on the floor. Five or six people were crowded into a small room. Over seventy people were seriously wounded, and twenty or thirty were on the verge of death. In addition, there were over two hundred people with broken hands and legs, gouged-out eyes, severed noses and ears, and shattered heads, all with knife and axe wounds. The sound of their weeping was unbearable. Upon going out to the streets, they saw that all the shops, large and small, of the Chinese merchants, as well as restaurants, food shops, barbershops, and goods stores, had been completely destroyed. Not a single item remained; everything had been looted. After the investigation, when they wanted to see the corpses, the police led them to a club, where they were served a large meal. Li and his party stated that this was not the time to eat a large meal. The Provincial Governor and others insisted that it was too dangerous to go, fearing that they could not provide adequate protection. Li and his party stated that they would go even without protection. Then they summoned a motorcar and went with the police. The motorcar turned many corners and traveled about eighteen li. Along the way, they saw hundreds of Chinese farmers' vegetable gardens, all of which had been burned, and the vegetables and seedlings had been completely destroyed and trampled. In total, there were over five hundred businesses and vegetable gardens, none of which remained. After traveling a long distance, they were finally informed of the location of the corpses, which were all buried. Five large trenches, each a zhang wide and three or four zhang long, had been dug and freshly filled with mud. When asked about the number of corpses, they said over ninety, but according to what we know, there were actually over two hundred. There were even coffins containing four or five dead children. In addition to these five large trenches, there were countless bodies buried in gullies and hastily covered. It was truly an act of unparalleled cruelty in history. There were still over nine hundred refugees who wanted to return from Pyongyang to Andong, but the train would not load them. At this moment, they only hope that our government will first find a way to rescue the refugees in Pyongyang, and that serious negotiations for the compensation of lives and property will be made. Li and his party completed their investigation and returned to Gyeongseong yesterday, where they reported the above situation in detail to the General Consulate and Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>A Letter from Korean Disaster-Stricken Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country to Fellow Countrymen</h3>
<p>It has been found that this Korean riot is completely different from the situation in 1927. There is a significant hidden agenda. Observing the various states of the riot, it is not difficult to understand. The sights and sounds are reported separately as follows. (1) According to our overseas Chinese disguised as Japanese who were informed that in Incheon Naeri (that is, Korean Street), more than a dozen Chinese merchants tightly closed their doors, and when the rioters arrived, they used freight cars to ram them open, or used pickaxes to chop them open. The goods in the houses, except for looting, were all discarded into the streets, and the fabrics were hung on telephone poles. All the utensils in the houses were smashed to pieces. It was also seen that the Koreans pulled two carts of stones, and the Japanese police directed them to pull the stones to the residence of the Chinese merchants, to be used for throwing nearby. The Japanese police did not step forward to expel them during the beatings. After the Korean violence had passed, the Japanese police began to disperse them, and the Chinese shops had been completely lost and unbearable to witness. (2) According to the report of the evacuees, on the night of July 3, two or three li away from the city in Songlinli, the overseas Chinese took refuge in the Japanese Iwamoto Milk Shop. It was seen that there were more than 20 Japanese infantry police and 12 mounted police who were on guard there. Suddenly, two or three hundred rioters came, separated by hundreds of steps, and happened to encounter dozens of Chinese. The rioters immediately launched a large-scale attack, killing three and injuring more than ten. The Japanese police stood by and did not step forward to expel them. After the beating, the Japanese police signaled the rioters to go elsewhere to beat them. This was heard and seen by the evacuees. (3) From 8:00 p.m. on the 3rd to the morning of the 5th, all the restaurants, food shops, barbershops in the city, and more than 200 vegetable gardens outside the city were either destroyed or burned, and none were spared. The vegetables in the gardens were trampled to nothing. The number of men and women killed and injured has been determined to be three corpses and two dying. In addition, the number of casualties is still unknown, because the rioters are still rampant and cannot be investigated. Currently, there are about 2,000 people taking refuge in Chinatown, and about 1,500 have returned to China. The Japanese authorities, except for Chinatown, have not been able to formally protect the rest of the places. (4) After the Pyongyang riots, the telephone was cut off for three days. On the 8th, a letter was suddenly received from the accountant of Fuhesheng Company in the hospital, reporting that his wife and young daughter had been beaten to death, and the fabrics, silks, and finished goods in the cabinets had been looted. Even the insurance safe was smashed to pieces. All the account books were torn up. The company's losses are estimated to be no less than tens of thousands of yuan. In addition, the details of the destruction and damage have not yet been obtained. According to Japanese newspapers, the loss in Pyongyang this time is about 400,000 yuan. The riots occurred at 4:00 a.m. on the 5th by means of a sneak attack. The overseas Chinese were caught off guard and fled in all directions, hiding nowhere and running without a road. They were helpless, resulting in more than a hundred deaths and injuries. (5) The General Consulate and the Chamber of Commerce in Gyeongseong have taken in more than 4,000 refugees. Countless Chinese grocery stores, restaurants, food shops, etc. in the city have been destroyed and have ceased operations. Vegetable gardens outside the city have also been destroyed as well. Although the Japanese police seem to protect them on the surface, they secretly instigate them. This time, more than a hundred overseas Chinese outside Dongmen were surrounded by Koreans. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese had iron shovels and wooden sticks to defend themselves and escape with their lives. The whereabouts of dozens of other women and children are still unknown. It is rumored that they have been buried in pits, but it remains to be verified. (6) The Korean riots were indeed instigated in advance by the Japanese newspapers, and they led their actions. Their tone is clearly visible. According to Japanese newspaper reports, there have been more than 300 incidents of riots, but the newspaper never publishes the deaths of overseas Chinese in various places. The filling of the trenches is unknown and deeply mourned. This report is an overview of the situation in Gyeongseong and Incheon. Outside the area, information is not available, and it is temporarily unknown how the lives and property of overseas Chinese are. (7) This Korean riot was indeed passive, but in reality, it contains a policy. The recent deployment in the three northeastern provinces shows that our compatriots should be wary, endure hardship, and treat it carefully. On the surface, they should be calm and not fall into their tricks. In particular, I hope that our country will quickly end internal strife, complete unification, pay attention to the oppression of the eastern neighbor, abandon internal fighting, and develop a common foreign policy to save the country from disaster. Every internal strife is a layer of oppression. The facts are clear and can be a warning. I also hope that the local newspapers will disclose and publicize this, as well as all schools and organizations, to carry out consistent propaganda and fight for it together. I can't wait for help, very urgent. The public statement of the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese who returned to the country.</p>

<h3>The Suppression of the Red Army Recovers Kangdu and Suichuan</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: In recent days, bandits from Taihe, Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng have retreated southward and gathered in the areas of Donggu, Longgang, Tantou, Zhongcun, Ningdu, and Xingguo. Bandits from Nanfeng, Guangchang, and Le'an have retreated to Luokou, Dongshao, Xiaobu, Ruijin, Shicheng, and Huichang. Bandits from Nancheng and Lichuan have fled to Chong'an, Ninghua, Jianning, Shanghang, and Tingzhou in Fujian. It is reported that those guarding Donggu are the forces of Huang Gonglue and Lin Biao, those fleeing to Fujian are the forces of Xiang Ying, those in Ningdu are the forces of Zhu and Mao, and those on the Jiangxi-Fujian border and in Ruijin are the forces of Luo Binghui. The bandits are extremely short of supplies and ammunition, while the suppression forces are advancing rapidly.</p>
<p>According to a war bulletin of the General Headquarters on the 11th, our left wing defeated the pseudo-19th Division on that day and occupied Kangdu. The bandits in the Qian Shan and Xiaoyangling areas also fled to their lairs. All the areas of Qian Shan have been recovered by our troops. Currently, in addition to a part of the left wing that has taken a path to the Desheng Pass on the Fujian border to join forces with Liu and Zhang's divisions to attack the bandits in western Fujian, a part is still advancing toward Guangchang. Guangchang City is surrounded and will be taken soon. Regarding the recovery of Lichuan, a telegram from Nancheng reports that (1) the left-wing army attacked and recovered Xiaoshi in winter and recovered Lichuan on the same day. The remaining bandits fled to the Fujian border and are being pursued. (2) Peng Dehuai and Yuan Guoping's forces, who had previously harassed Lichuan, robbed approximately five million yuan in property, burned dozens of houses, massacred more than 200 civilians, abducted more than 100 people as hostages, and forced more than 200 people to join the guerrillas. Nine out of ten residents have fled. (3) Peng's bandits, seeing our army's fierce pursuit and fearing capture, led a large number of bandits to flee to Jiangle in Fujian. A small number of bandits, numbering several thousand, remained in Tai'ning and Jianning in an attempt to hold their ground. Furthermore, a military agency received a telegram from Ji'an stating that Luo Shixi's brigade, Li's regiment, Yi's brigade, and Liu's regiment have advanced to Suichuan in separate directions and recovered the county seat. Zeng Bingchun's bandits led the remaining bandits from the county seat to Zaolin and retreated to Xianrenjing. Li Mingrui is still trapped in Shadi and is currently being surrounded and suppressed.

<h3>Red Bandits in Northern Fujian Have Fled Westward</h3>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang Returns to Fujian to Preside Over the Suppression of Bandits</p>
<p>Fuzhou, 10th: Since the Central Army in Jiangxi began the general offensive, the four bandit forces of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang have retreated to the counties of Guangze, Jianning, Taining, Shaowu, and Jiangle on the Fujian border, confronting the National Army between Jianyang and Shunchang. Recently, due to the Central Army's pursuing troops having advanced from Lichuan to Shaowu and Taining, the bandits are terrified of being attacked from both the front and the rear. Moreover, as Jianyang and Shunchang have heavily fortified defenses that cannot be breached, they have changed their plan. One route is to flee to Chong'an, and the other route is to flee to Shaxian. The Provincial Government issued a special order to the troops stationed in Pucheng to quickly send troops to intercept them, and established large reception centers in the four counties of Jianyang, Shunchang, Jian'ou, and Yanping to resettle the refugees fleeing from the bandit areas, and set up an office in each of the northwest regions to supervise them at any time. A joint naval and land defense meeting was held at the Provincial Government on the 8th. The detailed content could not be disclosed due to military secrets. On the 9th, a joint party and government meeting was held and resolved: (1) The Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government will each send two committee members to northern Fujian to welcome the Central Army entering Fujian and to offer condolences to the provincial combat troops. (2) The Provincial Party Department, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Education will jointly organize a bandit suppression propaganda committee. (3) All party and government personnel are ordered not to relocate during the period of martial law, and violators will be severely punished. (4) All county magistrates are ordered not to leave their posts without authorization, and violators will be severely punished. (The National Government is requested to provide generous compensation to Zhan Weiliang, the county magistrate of Chong'an who died in the disaster, and Zhang Yuguang, the county magistrate of Shaowu who abandoned the city and fled, will be handed over to the Department of Civil Affairs for investigation and punishment.) (5) All counties are ordered to organize defense corps to promote people's self-defense. On the 13th, it was reported that a part of the Central Army chasing the red bandits had arrived in Nakou, Shaowu, and another part had arrived in Jianning County. The various divisions are continuing to advance. Division Commander Liu Heding, with the arrival of the large army, specially ordered the troops in Jianyang and Shunchang to attack Shaowu and Jiangle from both sides. The red bandits were greatly panicked by the attack from both sides. The bandits between Shaowu and Jiangle have fled to Guihua, and the bandits between Liancheng, Taining, and Jianning have fled to Ninghua, planning to flee to Tingzhou to join forces with the native red bandits Deng Yigang and Zhang Dingcheng in western Fujian, holding out in the border area of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. The situation in northern Fujian has gradually eased. Jian'ou and Yanping are important rear strongholds. Due to the gathering of large armies and the stagnation of commerce, they have now returned to normal. Provincial Government Chairman Yang Shuzhuang, who had been ill in Shanghai for more than a month, returned to Fujian from Shanghai on the Puan warship on the evening of the 10th due to the tense military situation in northern Fujian. He arrived at the port in the afternoon of the 10th and arrived at the Provincial Government in the evening. He told reporters that the Central Army is winning the anti-bandit campaign in Jiangxi. Several divisions of troops have entered Fujian, and with the cooperation of the troops stationed in the province, it will not be difficult to wipe out the red bandits. The Central Government's subsidy to Fujian Province for the anti-bandit campaign has been partially received, and the remaining amount can also be given. As for my return to the province, it is specifically to preside over the military affairs of the anti-bandit campaign.</p>
<h3>The Haiyuan Pavilion Library Collection Issue</h3>
<p>Currently Negotiating a Purchase at Half Price</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the collection of books at Haiyuan Pavilion owned by the Yang family of Liaocheng, the Shandong Provincial Government advocates purchasing and preserving it. Previously, Wang Xiantang, the former director of the provincial library, went to Tianjin to personally negotiate with Yang Jingfu, the owner of the books. Recently, Lao Zhichang, Yang's father-in-law, made a trip to Jinan and then returned to Tianjin, also in connection with this matter. He Siyuan, the director of the Department of Education, mentioned that the provincial government's purchase of the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, through the efforts of the library director Wang Xiantang, has led to Yang's willingness to sell the entire collection to the Shandong Provincial Government at half price. The provincial government has expressed strong support for this, and in the future, Yu, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines Wang Fangting, and the library director will be responsible for handling it. Within days, they plan to send someone to Tianjin again to formally negotiate with Yang. As for the evaluation method, they intend to invite renowned domestic figures familiar with editions to provide a fair assessment. The provincial government will pay half of the assessed value, without the provincial government or the book owner setting the price. This method is considered the fairest. Furthermore, according to Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu, the book owner Yang Jingfu has agreed to sell the Haiyuan Pavilion collection to the provincial government at half price, but will retain the most essential Four Classics and Four Histories. Excluding these essentials, the remaining books can be purchased for around three to four hundred thousand yuan at half price. They will send someone to Tianjin within days to formally negotiate. However, the total collection, even at half price, is still a considerable sum. It has not yet been heard that the provincial government has made sufficient preparations for the funds. Lao Zhichang's recent visit to Jinan was primarily to assess whether the province has the financial capacity. Therefore, the only current obstacle is the issue of money. Whether it can be realized in the future does not solely depend on money. When Wang Xiantang returned from Tianjin earlier, it was widely rumored here that a certain important figure in the central government stated that the Haiyuan Pavilion collection represents Chinese culture and should be preserved by the nation. This rumor has now gained significant traction. Additionally, someone from an important cultural institution advocates preserving the Haiyuan Pavilion collection in the Peking Library, arguing that since it represents Chinese culture, it should be preserved in the cultural center, not necessarily in Shandong. This poses the biggest challenge currently. However, the book owner Yang Jingfu is from Shandong and respects his hometown, so he does not support the aforementioned proposal. Therefore, for several months, the discussion of national preservation has been brewing alongside Shandong's purchase.</p>
<h3>Further Report on the Case of an American Missionary Shooting a Chinese in Dezhou</h3>
<p>American Consul in Jinan Personally Goes to Dezhou to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of Dr. De Fulan, the vice-president of the Dongdi Bowei Hospital in Dezhou, shooting the Chinese worker Wang Guoqing, was reported yesterday. We now further learn that County Magistrate Li, Court President Wang, Prosecutor Sun,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>and various bureau directors and Mao, a committee member of the district party headquarters, went to the hospital to investigate the situation. They immediately questioned the perpetrator, De Fulan, who claimed that a theft had occurred at the hospital, resulting in a loss of several hundred yuan in public funds, which had not yet been solved. Therefore, he (De Fulan claimed) had been carrying a handgun every night, conducting secret investigations in hopes of catching the thief. On the morning of the 11th of this month, at around 6 AM, Wang Guoqing got up and went outside. He suspected Wang to be the thief and opened fire. Wang Guoqing then fled from the hospital and ran towards the west garden wall of the hospital. He continued to pursue and shoot, hitting Wang Guoqing in the waist, who then died under the wall. However, this is only a one-sided account from the suspect. The actual facts have not yet been determined. After the questioning, Prosecutor Sun examined the body. Led by a hospital worker to a small, dark room, they saw the body lying supine in a bathtub, covered in blood, the flesh and bones blurred, a truly tragic sight. The examination confirmed that Wang was indeed shot, the bullet entering from the back, rupturing an artery, and causing death. At 6 PM on the 11th, the district party headquarters convened an emergency meeting, attended by over a hundred representatives from various institutions and the public. They were all extremely indignant about this case. They decided on nine measures: (1) Send a telegram to the entire nation requesting unified support. (2) Immediately telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting serious negotiations with the United States. (3) Immediately detain the suspect, De Fulan, to be executed by the congress representatives together with the military and political authorities. (4) Notify all newspapers to publish the news consistently. (5) Expand propaganda and collectively boycott the United States. (6) Issue a warning in the name of the congress to the illegal assembly of the Christian board of directors. (7) Telegraph the provincial government in the name of the congress to lodge a serious protest with the American consulate, with the following minimum demands: (A) Execute De Fulan. (B) The American ambassador should apologize to the provincial and local governments, and guarantee that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again in the future. (C) Provide generous compensation to the deceased. (D) Stop Christian activities in the area and order the closure of Bowen Middle School. (8) Organize a support association for the tragic case of Wang Guoqing in Dezhou. (9) It is heard that De Fulan will flee to Yaozhan tomorrow, so the military and political authorities should immediately go and arrest him.</p>
<p>Because this case is of great importance, the current American Consul in Jinan, Mi Hede, took the Pingpu train number 202 at 6:40 PM last night (the 13th) to Dezhou to investigate the truth, so as to return to Jinan and seek a reasonable solution. (14th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Changes Sand Field Tax to Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>Annual Revenue Can Increase by One Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance previously suggested to the provincial government to clear the sand fields and increase taxes, to conduct the measurement in advance, and to change the tax to a land value tax. The provincial committee meeting has decided to approve this proposal and ordered the drafting of measures for increasing sand field taxes to be submitted for approval. After receiving the order, the Department of Finance, in addition to issuing a preliminary order for the amendment of the Sand Field Clearance Law, respectfully re-submitted a detailed report, stating that the land tax reform, which entails changing taxes to land value taxes, is included in the political program. Due to the lack of national land survey procedures, it has not yet been implemented. However, the differences between sand field and reed taxes and civilian land taxes are significant in Jiangsu Province. Previous large-scale land measurements and tax increases have relied entirely on registration and declarations, resulting in numerous malpractices. The province has more than eight million acres of sand fields, but the reed tax silver is less than two hundred thousand taels. In recent years, local surtaxes and donations in the province have increased repeatedly, exceeding the regular tax by four or five times. It is now proposed to measure the sand fields uniformly and increase taxes. In this way, the tax rates can be determined by comparing them with neighboring fields. After being incorporated into the general grain tax, the regular tax will not be a problem. However, the people are overburdened by the overlapping and increased surtaxes, which cause fear and inevitably lead to obstacles, so the process of increasing taxes and transporting them has not been successful for many years. This is why there is a need to change the sand field tax to a land value tax. Because the land value tax is a simple tax and not a repetitive tax, the people will gladly comply. The department has now made a comprehensive plan to list and calculate the regular and surtaxes on reeds in various counties. It has been found that there are approximately eight million acres of sand fields entered into the tax rolls in the province. If the reed fields that have not yet been taxed are included, there are approximately ten million acres in total. The original reed tax is a total of 442,500 yuan, and the surtax is a total of 1,583,600 yuan, totaling 2,026,000 yuan when combined. If the land value tax is changed, the value of the sand field is 70 yuan per mu above, and 20 yuan per mu below. On average, the province can collect more than 3 million yuan from the land value tax. Compared with the original income, it can increase by 1 million yuan. All original surtaxes and donations can still be drawn and reported as compensation. The people will not oppose the land value tax because it is a fair burden. Therefore, changing the sand field tax to a land value tax has three advantages in one stroke and is the best method of reform. After the sand fields are measured uniformly, regional valuation committees should be established to change the tax to a land value tax. The valuation methods will be formulated and submitted separately after this case is resolved. It is heard that the provincial government has submitted the report to the 412 Committee, and it has been decided to proceed accordingly.</p>

<h3>Anhui Chairman Chen Diaoyuan</h3>
<p>Previously went from Wuhu to Liu'an to suppress the Red Bandits. Now, because the main force has collapsed and dispersed to Hubei and Henan, he decided to entrust the defense of Liu'an and the task of eliminating the remaining bandits to Yue Shengxuan.

<h3>Elementary School Teacher Injures His Own Mother</h3>
<p>Jiang Nansheng, an elementary school teacher in Hua Jingqiao, which is under the jurisdiction of the county, was only three years old when he lost his father and was raised by his widowed mother, Wu. However, Nansheng was naturally rebellious. The day before yesterday, due to a trivial matter related to association funds, a dispute arose. Nansheng became angry and threw a small wooden stool at Wu's face, causing Wu's cheekbones to be broken, and blood flowed like a river. She fainted immediately. Afterwards, she realized that her son was unfilial and there was no reason to reason with him.

<p>Cai Zhu, a woman from Xicang Township in the county, previously filed a lawsuit in the county court against Liao Yonghua, a 63-year-old man from Anhui, for raping her 7-year-old granddaughter, Cai Su'e. After investigation and judgment by the court, Liao Yonghua was sentenced to seven years in prison. Afterwards, lawyers An Ruotai and Tang Ying appealed on his behalf. The day before yesterday, Li Mian, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the High Court, summoned the appellant Liao Yonghua, the appellee Cai Zhu, Cai Su'e, and the witness Cai Zhou for questioning. First, Liao Yonghua denied any obscene behavior, claiming that he was asking Cai Zhu to repay the white rice and money he had borrowed, which caused resentment and led to false accusations. Next, Cai Zhu and Cai Su'e both testified that they were indeed raped. The witness Cai Zhou also testified that there was indeed adultery. Finally, lawyers An and Tang spoke one after another, repeatedly debating points such as the diagnosis certificate from Puren Hospital, the fact that the front door and room door were not closed at the time, and the inconsistencies in the witness's testimony. Presiding Judge Li paid close attention to everything and set the verdict for the 21st.</p>

<h3>Son Kidnapped by Bandits, Elderly Mother Frightened to Death</h3>
<p>On the night of the 14th, a group of bandits suddenly came to the Chen Zhaosheng's house in Chenjia Lane, Fourth District of Wu County. Unable to get what they wanted, they dragged Zhaosheng to Chenshu Village, demanding 20,000 yuan. His mother, who was nearly 80 years old, was anxious when she saw her son being kidnapped, causing her to faint. After frequent negotiations between the villagers and the bandits, Zhaosheng was redeemed for 500 yuan. His mother was dying, and after unsuccessful resuscitation, she died on the morning of the 15th, which is also pitiful.</p>

<h3>Yu Cisheng Case Resolved</h3>
<p>Yu Jue from Suzhou submitted a petition to the provincial government requesting the cancellation of the public burial case of his wife Yu Shenshou in Tong, so that he could collect the coffin and move it back to Suzhou for burial. He also filed a complaint in the civil court of Nantong County against Zhang Xiaoruo to recover his wife's belongings left in Tong. Through the mediation of Wu Jichen, Zhang Dishan, Shen Baojun, and Shen Botao, a settlement was reached. The lawyers Yao Yuangui and Tang Shenfang provided proof, and the settlement agreement is as follows: (1) Yu Shenshou died of illness in Nantong and was publicly buried by local organizations at the foot of Huangni Mountain in Nantong. The report from the county to the ministry has been filed. All previous monuments and inscriptions will remain the same. Now, a public burial monument will be added by local organizations, inscribed with (The tomb of Ms. Yu Shenshou, artist from Wuxian, public burial, by Nantong Local Organizations, Republic of China, month and date), to be erected by Zhang Xiaoruo in consultation with local organizations within one year, and four boundary stones will be erected. (2) All items stored in the Nantong Museum (now under the jurisdiction of the Nantong College Board of Trustees), including a Jesus embroidery, a American Actress embroidery, a three-cat embroidery, a gold diamond watch, and three treasure stars, are agreed by both Zhang Xiaoruo and Yu Jue to remain in the museum permanently and are not to be removed by either party, so as to be immortalized. (3) The pension for Yu Shenshou's long-time head of the training center and the proceeds from the trade of raw cotton from Dasheng Yarn Factory are intended to build a kindergarten, to be allocated to Nantong Women's Normal School after Yu Shenshou's death for construction in due course. The intermediary will find a way to withdraw these two sums and raise them to a total of 6,000 yuan, to be received by Yu Jue, with 2,000 yuan paid immediately and the remaining 4,000 yuan paid in two installments, with 2,000 yuan paid by the end of October this year and 2,000 yuan paid by the end of June next year, with monthly interest of eight li, guaranteed by Wu Jichen to be paid on time. (4) All assets originally in the lawsuit and all items in the original lawsuit, as well as all other matters between the two parties, are completely settled this time and there are no objections. (5) Yu Jue will explain the circumstances of the settlement in the Nantong District Court and apply for the dismissal of the case to complete the formalities. Furthermore, Yu Jue's original submission, attached to the provincial approval, mentioned whether it is feasible to cancel the public burial and whether the Nantong County government should be ordered again to handle it impartially. Now that both parties have reached a settlement, Yu Jue will explain the reasons and submit a separate document to the county government for submission to the province for cancellation to end the dispute. (6) All clauses of the settlement agreement will be signed and sealed by both parties, and the lawyers and intermediaries of both parties will certify and seal them. Two copies will be made, one for each party, to be permanently observed. Yu Jue has now submitted the dismissal case to the Nantong County Government and the court.</p>

<p>Qiu Feihai distinguishes himself. A make-up match with South Grass Court is scheduled for next Monday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Court Tennis League's Chinese team competed against the Portuguese team at the Chinese Tennis Court yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. Over a hundred enthusiastic spectators watched the five groups of players showcase their skills. As the sun set in the west, good news arrived: the Chinese team won nine to six (winning nine games and losing six games), taking the lead with a group score of three to two. The Europeans left satisfied, feeling their trip was worthwhile. The results of the five doubles groups are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai 6-2 Corassa</p>
<p>(China) 6-3 (Portugal)</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang 6-1 Marseille</p>
<p>Second Group</p>
<p>Corassa 6-8 Guo Qida</p>
<p>(Portugal) 6-4 (China)</p>
<p>Koshtai 6-4 Zhan Wenyao</p>
<p>Third Group</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang 6-3 Gums</p>
<p>(China) 6-2 (Portugal)</p>
<p>Liu Keng 6-1 Lie Piro</p>
<p>Fourth Group</p>
<p>Tu Kaiyuan 2-6 Bosansi</p>
<p>(China) 8-6 (Portugal)</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin 9-7 Arifu</p>
<p>Fifth Group</p>
<p>Kostai 6-4 Wang Minshi</p>
<p>(Portugal) 6-2 (China)</p>
<p>Shana 6-1 Feng Nianci</p>
<p>The Qiu Jiang duo becomes the target of all. Tennis star Qiu Feihai originally had the ambition to cross Europe and experience the atmosphere of Wimbledon in England, but due to unforeseen circumstances, he is stuck in Shanghai. Yesterday, he paired with Jiang Daozhang, combining flexibility and strength. Their performance was outstanding, with Qiu actively preparing for the National Games.</p>
<p>The sports field is expected to be fully completed by mid-September, and staff appointments have been finalized. Half of the 1.5 million budget has already been allocated.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th Telegram. For the National Games construction, the athletic field has been completed by 60-70%. The soccer, basketball, volleyball, and all-around sports fields are also mostly completed and will be rushed to be finished by mid-September. The athletic field has tiered seating around its perimeter to avoid visual obstructions, and can accommodate over 40,000 spectators. Athlete dormitories can accommodate 3-4,000 people. In terms of preparations, over 200 domestic sports experts have been hired as referees, and letters of appointment have been issued. Job assignments will be specialized, with each referee focusing on one area rather than multiple. Over 2,000 athlete registration forms have been printed and distributed to various provinces and cities for submission. A photography department, telegraph office, and post office will be set up at the venue. The publicity department is meticulously planning the reporting of results, news releases, and event photography to ensure speed and efficiency. Accommodation for referees and athletes is being prepared by a dedicated team. Considering the different tastes of those from the north, south, and overseas Chinese, separate chefs have been hired to cater to them. Travel for referees and athletes during the games has been negotiated with the Ministry of Railways to offer a quarter of the regular fare as a discount. In terms of funding, the total budget is over 1.4 million, allocated by the Ministry of Finance in ten installments. Five installments have already been issued, and the remaining amount is expected to be released before the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu's quick strikes are likely to hit the mark at every turn, and applause rises from the audience. The opponent, Corassa, has a strong serve, and Marseille's net play is effective, but they still cannot withstand Qiu and Jiang's sharp attacks, losing again and again until all is lost. All the heroes do their best.</p>
<p>Liu Keng's net play is very varied, and Yu Tianguang's attack and defense are well-balanced. After three drum beats, the enemy is defeated and retreats. Yu and Liu return in triumph. Among the ten players in the five groups, the most powerful server is universally acknowledged to be Tu Kaiyuan of the fourth group. Tu has a large build and strong power, and is also good at pressing attacks. His partner, Qian Yaobin, is lively and agile, seemingly a natural match. Although they were defeated on the court, it is a fact that the opponent's skills were superior, and the new pairing inevitably had some discrepancies. However, Tu and Qian were able to rally in the second and third sets, fighting hard to defeat the enemy, which is commendable. The second group, Guo Qida and Zhan Wenyao, faced a tall and strong pair of enemies. Guo and Zhan did not give in, winning the first set, but were then attacked in the following two sets, suffering defeat after defeat, which was simply a matter of fact. Wang Minshi and Feng Nianci of the fifth group were completely defeated, not due to a lack of effort, but due to inferior skills. Match against South Grass Court next Monday. The match between the Chinese team and the South Grass Court team has been postponed repeatedly due to rain. It is now scheduled to be played next Monday at 5 PM at the Chinese Tennis Court. South Grass Court has many strong players, and it is expected that the Chinese team will have a good chance of victory.</p>

<p>Local News: Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese News Yesterday</p>
<p>Committee to Hold First Meeting Today. After the Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Congress resolved to sever economic ties with Japan, it warned all industries to prohibit the import of Japanese goods after the 14th. Yesterday, the association sent telegrams to comfort overseas Chinese and sent letters to newspapers nationwide to refuse to publish advertisements for Japanese goods. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting this afternoon to discuss implementation matters. The Xinming ship received a telegram and ceased its voyages to Korea. Also, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a standing committee meeting yesterday and resolved to send telegrams to chambers of commerce at home and abroad to raise large sums of money to aid the afflicted overseas Chinese compatriots. The telegrams will be sent out after the executive committee meeting this afternoon. The details of each message are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Committee Members. The Secretariat of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang sent a letter to all members of the Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, the list of members for the Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee was previously put forward by the Congress and sent to our committee for review and approval. The number of members is thirty-seven. We have found that you are also one of the members. We are enclosing a copy of the complete list for your reference. Please work hard to facilitate the progress."</p>
<p>First Meeting. Respectfully, the list of members for the Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee was previously determined by the Congress of Representatives from All Circles and submitted to the City Party Headquarters Executive Committee for review. It has been confirmed that you and thirty-six others are members, and Da Chun and two others have been designated to be responsible for convening the first meeting. The first committee meeting is scheduled to be held on the 17th of this month (Friday) at 2:00 PM in the City Chamber of Commerce's regular meeting room to discuss implementation matters. A separate letter has been sent to you. We respectfully request that you attend on time. Convener: Hou Dachun, Wang Xiaolai, Tao Baichuan.</p>
<p>Hopes for Commercial Awakening. The Hebei Provincial Chamber of Commerce Association telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the association convened a congress on the 12th of this month and resolved to establish the Hebei Provincial County and Town Chamber of Commerce Support Association for the Wanbaoshan Massacre. It also sent telegrams to chambers of commerce nationwide, advocating for a complete economic boycott of Japan from this day forward, and jointly supporting the Wanbaoshan Massacre.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Proposal. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its 54th Standing Committee meeting yesterday. Eight people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Xu Jilun, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Wenqi, Yan Esheng, and Zheng Chengqing. They discussed the proposal to raise funds to aid the distressed overseas Chinese in Korea. It is believed that the actions taken in Korea to persecute overseas Chinese this time were most severe in places such as Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang, and Sinuiju. In addition to the dead and injured, the shops and houses were destroyed, and many were displaced and homeless. It is difficult to turn a blind eye to this for the sake of national survival and to maintain the industrial and commercial status of Koreans for decades. The association has repeatedly received telegrams from various overseas Chinese chambers of commerce in Korea requesting fundraising assistance. There are a total of 80,000 overseas Chinese in Korea, and the disaster areas this time are all important cities and regions where overseas Chinese congregate. Although there is no detailed report on the number of victims at this time, the number is definitely not small. Moreover, there are many who have been doing business in Korea for many years. Although they have suffered losses this time, they still need to continue in Korea to prepare for the resumption of business. This is different from those who simply need to prepare travel expenses to return to their home country. Therefore, the relief funds this time must be generously prepared to allow for distribution. It is necessary to initiate a telegram to chambers of commerce at home and abroad to first raise large sums of money. The survival of the nation and the people is at stake. All those who have life and breath should be willing to work hard and fight to save the country. This is different from other fundraising events. Saving the country and the people cannot be delayed. It was resolved to submit it to the executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM today for approval and then actively implement it.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Relief. The Yantai All Circles Wanxian Massacre Foreign Affairs Support Association telegraphed yesterday, saying: "To the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, various provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, Red Cross Society, Red Swastika Society, various charitable organizations, newspaper offices, and compatriots from all walks of life, the massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans is becoming increasingly serious. The lives and property of more than 100,000 overseas Chinese merchants from the north and south gangs are in imminent danger. In addition to dispatching ships for assistance and raising funds for relief, the disaster is so severe that it is unprecedented. A drop in the bucket is of no real benefit. We implore compatriots nationwide to rise up together to raise urgent relief funds and send them directly to Chinese chambers of commerce in Seoul and Incheon to relieve their plight. We are waiting anxiously for orders. The Yantai All Circles Wanxian Massacre Foreign Affairs Support Association Preparatory Committee respectfully sends their greetings."</p>
<p>Telegram of Condolences to Overseas Chinese Compatriots. The Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Congress sent a telegram yesterday, saying: "To the President Zhang of Korea, transferred to all overseas Chinese compatriots, the Japanese have instigated Koreans to drastically discriminate against Chinese, destroy shops, and massacre overseas Chinese, creating an unprecedented disaster. What crime have the overseas Chinese committed to suffer such tribulation? Such insidious behavior would be unbearable and unthinkable for anyone with even a little humanity or a little justice. Yet the Japanese are brazenly doing it without any scruples. As the saying goes, those who rely on virtue prosper, and those who rely on force perish. If our compatriots still have a breath left, we should never coexist with them. We pledge to fight to the death. In addition to telegra</p>

<h3>Child Born in Mid-Air</h3>
<p>In recent years, the aviation industry in Europe and America has been extraordinarily developed. Regardless of gender, people enjoy taking air trips. Curious people even hold wedding ceremonies in the air. Unexpectedly, recently in a certain place in England, a baby was born in mid-air, more than four thousand feet above the ground. It turned out that the mother, because labor was imminent, could not wait and took a monoplane to the hospital. Unexpectedly, on the way, the baby in her womb cried and fell to the ground. A child born in mid-air is said to be the latest record in Europe and America. It has never happened before. As for children born on trains, it is quite common. The most interesting thing is that a pair of twins were born on a train in 1918. Because their birth times were different, one was born in the territory of the United States, and the other was born in the territory of Canada.</p>
<h3>Six Thousand Affectionate Mothers Mourn National Tragedy</h3>
<p>In May 1930, six thousand women from the United States traveled far to Europe. They landed in England and went together to the battlefields of the World War to mourn the graves of the soldiers who died for their country. It turned out that they all had sons who were killed in the war. They were buried in the battlefield at that time and their bones were not returned to their hometowns. Therefore, they came to mourn them. All expenses for this trip were borne by the US government. They departed in batches from May to August. It is said that this will still be the case this summer. This is truly a touching thing. The British government also plans to follow this method to subsidize many British loving mothers to go to the battlefield to mourn their sons who died in the war.</p>
<h3>Strange and Bizarre Obituary  Ping</h3>
<p>Since the death of the wealthy maritime merchant Hardoon, the Ai Li Yuan (爱俪园) Funeral Office has chosen the 21st of this month to inscribe the spirit tablet. Obituaries have been distributed daily to relatives and friends related to Hardoon during his lifetime. The format and wording of this obituary are quite peculiar and not commonly seen in modern society. Excerpts are provided for readers to enjoy.</p>
<p>The obituary is rectangular, with a length to width ratio of twenty-four to fourteen inches. It consists of eight pages, with a total length of over eight feet. In terms of length, the obituaries printed by the Northern Warlords, former Qing elders, and President Li Yuanhong pale in comparison. This shows a glimpse of the extravagance of capitalists. The text reads: "Grand Republic of China awarded the First Class Medal, posthumously awarded the First Class Grand Girdle Precious Light Golden Harvest Medal, posthumously awarded the First Class Wenhu Medal, specially presented with the plaque 'Nostalgia for Antiquity,' posthumously awarded the Second Class Grand Girdle Precious Light Golden Harvest Medal, Second Class Wenhu Medal, Second Class Golden Harvest Medal, Qing Empire specially awarded the Second Class First Order Precious Star, specially granted a banquet, specially awarded the plaque 'Utmost Joy for Music,' successively awarded Spring Couplets, characters for 'Fortune,' 'Longevity,' 'Dragon,' 'Tiger,' 'Amitabha Buddha,' three-inlaid Ruyi scepters, Jiang Silk Damask, White Jade Thumb Rings, Porcelain Vases, Sachets, Black Tea, Fruit Snacks, the Complete Edition of the Peiwen Yunfu, Rubbings of the San Shi Pan, etc." Then it narrates: "Duke O.S. Hardoon of Great Britain, in grief for the year 1931 of the Western calendar… Immediately following Jewish rites, personally overseeing the encoffining and respectfully leading the family. All dressed in mourning, buried in this garden…" Below are listed the chief mourner, wife Luo Jialing, and eleven adopted sons and daughters, including adopted sons and daughters with the Luo surname, adopted grandsons and granddaughters, adopted great-granddaughters, adopted sons-in-law, and adopted nephews, totaling twenty-eight people. Finally, the director of funeral affairs, adopted younger brother Ji Juemi, is listed. Looking at the above text, it first narrates the Grand Republic of China, then the Great Qing Empire, Great Britain, and Judaism. A single obituary includes four national designations. It is a combination of Chinese and Western styles, truly unique. Hardoon had no offspring. The so-called adopted sons and daughters are Hardoon's own foreign adopted children. Those prefixed with the Luo surname are Madam Luo's Chinese adopted children. Ji Juemi is also attached at the end as an adopted younger brother, which is especially rare.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Hardoon's estate is worth seventy-five million taels. How will his lifetime of diligence and thrift be distributed and used? It is recorded in his will. Since it has not been published, I dare not speculate. However, it is our opinion that Hardoon's wealth was obtained from China and should also be used in China to be fair. It is also heard that Madam Luo intends to allocate a portion of the property to build several Buddhist pagodas in Ai Li Yuan. However, it has not been heard that she is considering the interests of our country and people. We believe this is not right. If she could allocate a few tenths of it to broadly support education, charity, and public welfare undertakings in China, to seek happiness for society and the country, and to fulfill his unfinished ambitions, wouldn't her merit be immeasurable and the kindness appreciated by more than just the Shanghai area? Hardoon is gone. It is hoped that Madam Luo can understand this sentiment and adopt this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Occasional Verse on the New Qixi Festival  Tianxu Wosheng</h3>
<p>This year's new Qixi Festival, I live alone in West Lake.</p>
<p>A thousand miles in dreams returning far, (Shanghai and Hangzhou are more than 400 miles apart. Every night, I reach Cangzhou, which is nearly 1000 miles round trip. If dreams could be real, how delightful!)</p>
<p>The Three Pools' lamps are already lit, (The Three Pools Mirroring the Moon has electric lights installed. If revolving lights were added at the pavilion corners and eaves, reflecting on the lotus pond, and water lines were connected to illuminate all the pagoda lamps, reflecting with frosted glass, then even on moonless nights, there would be a moon.)</p>
<p>My poetic heart should be endless, mundane affairs are temporarily set aside. (I suffer from ileitis, which injures my qi. Whenever I cough severely, my lower abdomen bulges like a mound, causing unbearable pain. Someone needs to press it down to restore it. If I were to stand upright when stooped, my ileum would surely rupture. Therefore, I have been wearing an abdominal support belt for a long time as instructed by the doctor. It has been terribly hot here, and I had to take it off. Fortunately, it hasn't recurred in the past month. This is probably the effect of setting aside mundane affairs and temporarily not racking my brains.)</p>
<p>I only blame the twin stars for being lazy, the bridge is not yet complete. (My wife wanted to come, but couldn't due to illness. I am also staying because of illness. The departure date is set and then changed again. Therefore, I write this as a substitute for a family letter.)</p>
<h3>Talking About Sound Films  Sheng Han</h3>
<p>There are several types of equipment for producing sound films: "Vitaphone," "Photophone," and "Movietone." Among them, "Movietone" is the best because it uses sound-on-film technology and is the newest style.</p>
<p>The center of the world's film industry is undoubtedly Hollywood in the United States. The machinery for sound films is also the most sophisticated in the United States. Even Germany, with its advanced science, cannot match it. And Japan, which is good at imitation, still cannot emulate it. This shows that researching science is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Since the advent of sound films, silent films have not been completely eliminated, but they have gradually faded into obscurity. Looking at the major cinemas in Shanghai, they are all competing to show sound films to attract audiences. The viewers' attention has also shifted accordingly.</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company recently purchased the complete "Movietone" equipment from the United States for 400,000 yuan in gold. There are more than ten giant crates. Inside is a truck, which is used to mount the complete camera and microphone when shooting outdoor scenes. There are also more than forty light bulbs. This is because ordinary kerosene lamps have a kind of noise that is not suitable for shooting sound films.</p>
<p>Coming with the equipment are four sound film experts from Hollywood. One is a cinematographer who has worked for United Artists for many years. Most recently, he filmed "The Moon of the Silver Screen" for Douglas Fairbanks and Bebe Daniels. (This film has been shown in Shanghai.) The other three are a sound engineer, a producer, and a designer. According to the cinematographer, the results in the future will definitely not be below Hollywood productions. If we believe this, Chinese sound films should open up a new scene. It is also heard that the company's first sound film is "Spring in the Opera House" and the second is "Shanghai Miss."</p>
<h3>Three Snakes Become Turtle  Xu Xiaoting</h3>
<p>Changes in animals that deviate from the norm, such as tadpoles transforming into mosquitoes or pupae transforming into moths, are common physiological phenomena. However, things like a hen turning into a rooster or a venomous snake turning into a turtle are rarely seen. A few days ago, a tofu shop worker surnamed Yang, outside the north gate of the city, bought a turtle on the way. The body of the turtle was no different from ordinary turtles, costing more than forty copper coins. After buying it, Yang took it to a friend's place, inviting him to share it. The friend's appetite was aroused upon seeing it. He took a sharp knife to cut open its abdomen. Who knew that before the knife reached its body, a snake's head with blood-red scales suddenly appeared from under the turtle's tail, stretching and contracting, as if to swallow. The friend was very frightened upon seeing this and immediately threw it on the ground. It was then picked up by someone who cut open its abdomen to see what was inside. Only things shaped like intestines were seen, filling it up. The turtle was clearly transformed from a venomous snake. Afterwards, according to some fishermen, this was formed by three snakes combining together. Eating it would cause poisoning. Fortunately, Yang's friend discovered it early, otherwise, his life would have been in danger. I have often heard old farmers say that when a snake transforms into a turtle, it must first crawl to the top of a tree and then fall to the ground to become a turtle. In the case of the one purchased by Yang, the intestines-shaped objects filling its abdomen clearly indicated that several snakes were stacked together. Therefore, I record this for the study of zoologists.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on Korea (7)  Ji Ping</h3>
<p>The Japanese method of immigrating to Korea is truly ingenious. They exploit the weakness of Korean farmers being uneducated and having simple thoughts, using tricks to deceive them. Firstly, they enjoy special privileges in Korea, and secondly, Japanese intelligence far exceeds that of Koreans. Therefore, they occupy a superior position everywhere and can take whatever they want without any obstacles. Now, I will give an example to prove this.</p>
<p>Most Korean farmers are poor and not accustomed to hard work. Therefore, they often feel the pain of a difficult livelihood. When they are extremely bored, they have no choice but to borrow money. In rural areas, most Japanese are wealthy. When the Koreans want to borrow money from them, the Japanese are very generous and lend it without hesitation. They are not bothered even after several attempts. However, the interest is very high, and collateral is required. Koreans generally have the bad habit of laziness. When they have money today, they don't want to work anymore. They smoke, drink, and gamble to their heart's content. When they run out tomorrow, they will go back to work the day after tomorrow. They are extremely extravagant, which is the worst prevailing illness among Koreans. The creditors wait for the amount of money you borrow to accumulate and become equal to the value of your property. Then, they demand repayment. If you are unable to repay, then, great, use your house or land as collateral. They will give you a deadline. They know that you won't be able to repay it. They only want your property, not necessarily the repayment of cash. When the deadline arrives, and you are still penniless, they will immediately turn hostile. They will report it to the police station, seize your property, and resell it to the Japanese. It is said that they are always doing this trick to deceive Koreans of their houses and land. The final goal of the Japanese is to completely occupy the fertile land and beautiful villages of Korea, and have Japanese people live there. They will then transfer the Korean farmers to Manchuria and Mongolia in our country to be pioneers in their land reclamation. Their scheming is indeed superior.</p>
<p>Those Koreans mentioned above who are bankrupt, due to being exploited by the Japanese's high-interest loans and tempted by money, become homeless. The police station, according to the household registration survey, registers the unemployed one by one and finds a way out for them. After a certain period, when the number of people is sufficient, they gather those farmers, announce the purpose and plan of immigration, and then send soldiers to escort specially prepared trains. They go to Manchuria and Mongolia in a grand manner to reclaim land. Unintelligent Korean farmers, after listening to a hypocritical speech, actually express satisfaction, believing that the Japanese can think of a way to survive and develop for them. How would they know that they are being invaded of their property and expelled from the country by the Japanese, becoming pawns in their invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia? They are being used as puppets, but they don't even know it. They still recognize the thief as their father. Where else in the world can you find such a foolish nation? It is said that when the Japanese announce the purpose of immigration to the Korean farmers, they start by saying, "You are truly pitiful. The Chinese have taken your Manchuria and Mongolia for who knows how many years. Now, we are only reclaiming them for you. How difficult is this? Everyone, go and reclaim the land well, cherish your own land, and don't let the Chinese bully you again." Alas, this is truly turning right and wrong upside down, confusing black and white. Although they are very foolish, the Korean farmers, after hearing such stimulating words, will naturally bravely step forward and go to Manchuria and Mongolia to take action. We only need to look at the alarming number of Korean farmers in Manchuria and Mongolia to further understand the Japanese's aggressive ambitions. The Japanese are loudly singing the so-called Manchuria, Mongolia, and Korea policy, lumping our Manchuria and Mongolia together with Korea. This is truly a big joke. Our compatriots, the opportunity is critical. Let's all rise up and save the country!</p>
<p>Novel Club of Rotary ??? (24)  Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>After the child left, Ziliang became much quieter, but the lady downstairs was calling again:</p>
<p>"Ziliang:"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Do you have Rendan?"</p>
<p>"Who wants it?"</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>How could Ziliang not care after hearing this?</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"I feel a little unwell!"</p>
<p>"Unwell? Come up quickly!"</p>
<p>The lady slowly walked upstairs, her face indeed looking very unwell. Ziliang first told her to lie on the bed, then took seven Rendan pills and gave them to her to eat. Then he asked:</p>
<p>"What kind of unwellness?"</p>
<p>The lady didn't speak, pointing to her chest with her finger.</p>
<p>"Discomfort in the chest? Feeling stuffy?"</p>
<p>Yueru nodded. Ziliang remembered:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's the old problem! Liver qi acting up!"</p>
<p>She seemed to acknowledge that it was. Other women's liver qi acts up after getting angry. Ms. Yueru's liver qi acts up in the opposite way, precisely after excessive happiness. Once Ziliang identified her problem, he could naturally prescribe the right medicine:</p>
<p>"I'll go get some agarwood powder for you to eat!"</p>
<p>The lady nodded. Ziliang found a small packet of agarwood powder in the drawer, asked the nanny to bring a cup of boiled water, and she finished them together.</p>
<p>He also unbuttoned the buttons on his clothes and pointed to his chest with his finger. Ziliang understood that every time Yueru's liver qi acted up, if it got severe and she couldn't calm down, Ziliang would use his hand to stroke her chest, about several hundred strokes, until it gradually stopped hurting.</p>
<p>Ziliang first went to get a small stool, sat in front of the bed, and then used his hand to stroke her chest, first lightly then heavily, first slowly then quickly. At this moment, Ziliang had completely forgotten about the one hundred and sixty-odd composition books from his students.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Continue to Decline, Swap Spreads at Two to Three Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold prices continued to weaken, breaking through the 740 tael mark again. However, the market was turbulent, with changes of ten taels at every turn, making it difficult to grasp and extremely chaotic. It coincided with a swap period, so the exchange opened its doors at 7 AM but only opened the trading floor at 8 AM. However, various firms had already been trading amongst themselves. The swap was initiated by the longs, initially at five qian. Later, the shorts refused to swap, so the longs had to raise the price, eventually exceeding three taels. The listed price was 3.3 qian, then 3.67 qian, and by noon it had dropped to between two taels. It is said that Hengxing and firms with physical gold did not participate in the swap, planning to settle with physical gold at maturity. However, many longs, such as the Ningbo gang, had already completed the transaction. There were quite a few firms on both the long and short sides that had not completed the swap. As for August, there were no further transactions, and most were converted to September. The opening price was 736.2 taels, and the closing price was 740 taels, a further drop of 1.5 taels from the previous day. The afternoon listing had already been canceled. The September launch was expected to see varying degrees of activity.</p>
<p>The silver market reported gains, initially opening weak but later weakening further due to a shortage of drafts, falling more than ten taels to 732-733 taels. However, with the exchange rate stabilizing, large buyers competed to purchase, causing a sharp rise of 13-14 taels, reaching over 746 taels. The market was still volatile, with swings of four to five taels at times. Sentiment was unsettled, with divergent opinions. It is speculated that large firms may push for further gains this morning.</p>
<h3>September Launch Sees Initial Weakness</h3>
<p>Since 8 AM, the September opening price was 739.5 taels, followed by 40 taels and 5 qian, dropping to 37.5 taels, indicating strong selling pressure. The interest rate on large silver bars was 3/16, and the forward rate was 1/8. Silver prices in both public and private telegrams rose by 1/8. The market remained weak, but the US and British exchange rates fell again, causing downward pressure. It was then reported that the US stock market was declining, and speculators were buying in, driving the price up to 44.5 taels. Unexpectedly, drafts initially weakened, with banks offering 375, then 4375. With many firms selling off, the price plummeted to 32.5 taels at 9 AM. Later, hedgers bought in, and Anda and others absorbed August and September contracts at 375 to 4375, settling at 3125, causing a rebound of over eight taels, reaching 41.2 taels. The price then declined by a small three taels. When the issuing bank opened but did not change, the US dollar decreased by a small 125, and the Japanese yen increased by half a fen. Banks absorbed 3125 again, and Mitsui absorbed Japanese yen at 1.5975 qian, causing the price to rise to 42.5 taels. Soon after, the price decreased by slightly more than one tael. At 10 AM, commodity hedgers and Tong Taichang, Qian Changxiang, and others came to compete for purchases, indicating a tightening by the issuing bank, with 13.25 being offered for sale, reaching 46.5 taels after 10:30 AM. Later, with Shunli, Wanxing, and small firms agreeing to sell, the price declined again, reaching 40.08 taels at 11:20 AM. Shortly after, Sumitomo absorbed Japanese yen at 1.60125 qian, and Yuan Mao Yong and others bought in, pushing the price up by more than three taels.

The noon closing price was 42 taels, and the revealed price was changed to 786.6 taels, with pressure from 47 taels to 40 taels. The noon closing price was 44 taels.</p>
<h3>Selling Pressure in the Evening Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 43.5 taels, then 44 taels, with the Indian exchange rate reported slightly lower. Subsequently, the rate was consistently reported higher. With large firms aggressively selling, including Bingxing, Yuan Mao Yong, and Zhifeng Yong, the price plummeted by eleven taels, reaching 33 taels at 2:45 PM. Later, Dadecheng and others aggressively bought in, increasing the price by five taels, with fluctuations of two taels. At 3:20 PM, the price was 38 taels. Shortly after, speculator Wu sold off on the trading floor, causing weakness. The price further declined to 33.2 taels at 4 PM. In a flash, news of the Indian exchange rate returning to a small two-cent increase, and with Dadecheng dragging in, the price immediately rose by more than five taels to 38.5 taels. However, sellers did not cease, and the market remained weak. With the British gold rate at 3125 to 375, and Japanese banks reportedly absorbing at 4375, the price retreated to 35.5 taels. The closing price at 4:30 PM was 35.8 taels, then trading occurred at 33-34 taels, then 32.5 taels. Compared to the previous day (swap), the price fell by approximately three taels. The maximum price for the day was 46.5 taels, and the minimum price was 32.5 taels, a difference of fourteen taels.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Gang's Spot Trading is Very Active</h3>
<p>The spot market opened in the morning at 39.5 taels, closed at noon at 42.3 taels, and closed in the afternoon at 32.5 taels.

The after-market for July-August was 34 taels, and for September was 36 taels. Replenishing the water was 40 taels in the afternoon and 34 taels in the afternoon. The spot red strip was calculated to be plus 11.5 taels due to the swap, with the price declining by a small two taels. Tianjin Gang's business was very active. Yingfeng Heng sold four to five thousand taels, and took in over one thousand taels, relying on the maturity of the August contracts for support. Trading among firms was complex and inconsistent.</p>
<p>As for new transactions for the September contract on the trading floor, it was difficult to investigate due to the swap, with varying entries and exits by various firms. It is heard that Zhifeng Yong and Futai Heng had more entries than exits. Yuan Mao Yong, Dadecheng, Cuichang Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Tai, Fuchang, Shunli, Wanxing, and others had irregular entries and exits. Other large firms had more exits. In the afternoon, Bingxing sold over two thousand bars. Dadecheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, and Yuan Tai had significant entries and exits.

<h3>Stable and Quiet Situation of the Clearing Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver and money industry was not very active in terms of trading and settlement, as most businesses were calm during the summer season. There was no room for development in the supply of silver. The outflow of foreign funds had not been seen for a long time.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Suddenly Plunge Yesterday</h3>
<p>Falling by approximately two yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading situation of various bonds in the Shanghai securities market was as follows: only the spot market opened slightly in the morning, with no market in the afternoon. The futures prices fluctuated greatly, and the transactions remained active. Due to time constraints, there was only one transaction in the afternoon. When it first opened in the morning, there were rumors in the market that the situation in Zhili and Henan was changing, causing unease. The market was somewhat tense for a while. Northern sellers were active, and speculators were also actively selling, so bond prices fell sharply. The 20% Customs Bond, 19% Customs Surtax, demobilization, etc., all fell by as much as 2.5 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment was still weak, but selling pressure weakened, and buyers successively bought in strongly. Therefore, the 19% Customs Surtax, etc., rebounded more firmly than in the morning, and the 20% Customs Bond rose even more sharply. However, as a result, the demobilization, surtax, July futures, and 19% Customs Surtax futures all fell by two yuan and several jiao. The rest also fell by a small one yuan to one yuan and seven or eight jiao, except for the 96%, which only fell by a few jiao. Spot transactions totaled only 4,000 yuan, and futures transactions totaled 21.14 million yuan in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>| Bond Type | Spot/Future | Previous Opening | Afternoon Closing | Change from Previous Day | Transaction Volume |</p>
<p>| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |</p>
<p>| 6% | July | 60.80 | 60.55 | Down 0.95 | 260,000 |</p>
<p>| Customs Duty | July | 52.30 | 51.60 | Down 1.20 | 270,000 |</p>
<p>| Demobilization | Spot | 52.00 | ...... | Down 1.50 | 1,000 |</p>
<p>| Demobilization | July | 52</p>
<h3>Trafficking of Women Uncovered</h3>
<p>Shèng Chūnshēng, a stonemason from Zhāng Ēnqiáo, Dàcūn, Xīndài, and Gù Xìnglín enticed village girls Zhāng Guìbǎo, Zhāng Wǔbǎo, and Zhōng Wénbǎo into physical relationships. Recently, the stone bridge project was completed, and Shèng and Gù seized the opportunity to lure the three women, intending to sell them in Shanghai. The three women, seduced by them, packed up all their belongings and boarded a steamer to Shanghai yesterday (the 14th).</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the boat, they encountered police officers from the Xīndài Public Security Bureau who found their behavior suspicious. Upon questioning, the men and women appeared flustered, and they were detained and escorted to the Pínghú County Public Security Bureau. After interrogation by Clerk Táo, the truth was revealed, and they were transferred to the county government for investigation. The women's families have also filed petitions with the county government, demanding a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Requesting Reprimand for the Ancient Temple Magistrate</h3>
<p>The main hall of the North Temple in this city was built during the reign of Emperor Wǔzōng of the Táng dynasty and is a famous ancient relic in the county. The beams and four pillars are made of a type of Phoebe zhennan wood, remaining as good as new for a long time. For thousands of years, the county has experienced repeated wars and disasters, but this hall and the Twin Pagodas of Bǎoxīng in front of the hall have stood firm. Now, the Bǎoxīng Pagodas have been repaired with funds raised by many local gentry. However, the county government, at the request of a local organization, approved the demolition of the hall, using the materials to offset labor costs. This was opposed by the Buddhist Association, so the demolished materials were carefully preserved, to be sold after the project is completed. However, this plan was not approved by the district party headquarters, and the Buddhist Association strongly opposed it, causing public discontent. Shěn Cǎichén, a resident of the East Gate, petitioned to postpone the demolition in order to find a proper solution. The county government rejected the petition, stating that the presented facts were not verified and lacked legal basis, and issued a reprimand. Shěn, dissatisfied with the decision, is preparing to petition the higher authorities.</p>

<p>In Táng'ào, Yuánjiā'ào, and other places, more than ten miles from Fèngchéng, there have been recent incidents of large-scale bandit arson and looting, and rumors of a major attack on the city are rampant. With the approval of the provincial government in response to the request of local gentry, an order was telegraphed to Wú Cónglóng, the commander of the six regiments of the Bǎiguān Security Team, to quickly dispatch troops for a strict suppression. Commander Wú relayed the order to Zhuāng Yòuxīn, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion stationed in Níngbō, to immediately lead troops to suppress the bandits. Commander Zhuāng, after receiving the order, promptly directed the 6th Company to hire a small steamer this morning and set off to Fènghuà for a rigorous suppression.</p>
<h3>Lǐ Family Robbery Outside the North Gate</h3>
<p>At the home of Lǐ Xiǎomáo in Wāntóu Bāojiācáo, more than ten miles outside the North Gate of this city, at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, six bandits suddenly arrived and looted extensively. A total of eighteen silver dollars, five paper dollars, and earrings, worth about thirty dollars, were stolen.

<h3>The Línpǔ Jurisdiction Issue Remains Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>Half of Línpǔ Town in Xiāoshān belongs to the Shào border, so the administrative jurisdiction cannot be unified. Magistrate Dù, in addition to holding meetings between the two counties, has submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs to unify the administrative power of Línpǔ Town under Xiāoshān. However, this is currently opposed by the residents of Tiānlè in Shàoxīng County, and a telegram has been sent to the Shàoxīng County Party Headquarters and County Government to vigorously argue for the establishment of a separate sub-bureau in Shàoxīng. Furthermore, Dù Wéiguó, the former head of the 4th District Sub-Bureau of Xiāoshān under the Provincial Committee, has suddenly received an order from the province to temporarily postpone his duties. Therefore, the administrative jurisdiction issue between the two counties is difficult to resolve for the time being.</p>
<h3>Qiánjiāng River Tide Floods and Sinks Vessels</h3>

<p>The Hǎijiā Security Corps of Línhǎi, stationed in the 2nd Team of the Jiāzhǐ Corps, was patrolling near Yán Yǔ Street at around 10:00 PM the night before last when a villager named Chén Guófù suddenly approached. The militiaman asked for the password, but the villager could not answer, so the militiaman fired a warning shot. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit Chén Guófù in the chest, and he died immediately. The next day, the district chief Táng Yǔn reported it to the county government, which forwarded it to the Judicial Public Court. The coroner confirmed the facts.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Responds to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Aurora University Should Be Registered</h3>
<p>This year, no officials will be dispatched to supervise examinations.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which included a letter from the French Minister to China stating that the Chinese government had previously dispatched officials to supervise the graduation examinations held at Aurora University in Shanghai. Now that the Chinese government has discontinued this practice, the diplomas issued by the university may not be recognized by the Chinese government, which would significantly affect the graduates. The minister proposed that the university be treated in the same way as American-founded universities in China. Attached was the original letter from the minister to the Minister of Education, requesting that it be forwarded for review. It was noted that the university had been established for a long time, had a commendable academic record, and was well-equipped, comparable to American-founded universities. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to grant it the same treatment as those universities to encourage it. The Ministry of Education replied, "Having received the communication from your ministry stating the above, upon review, the universities founded by American missionary societies in China have mostly complied with our country's current education laws and regulations and have been approved by this ministry for registration. Aurora University can follow the same procedure to avoid discrepancies. After the university submits its application through the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, this ministry will provide assistance within its capabilities to encourage it. Attached are copies of the University Organization Law, University Regulations, and Regulations for Private Schools for your reference and forwarding."</p>
