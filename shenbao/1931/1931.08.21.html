<p>一般販賣日貨的商人，想來不是甘心要做這種生意，恐怕都是積了悠久的歷史，不是一朝一夕了。可是日本人的手段太酷辣，用心太陰險，國際間太不講道德·我國民含辛茹痛，赤手空拳，除了經濟上制他死命以外，没有别的方法。所以不用日貨提倡國貨，是我們國民目下惟一地抵抗日人的武器。希望販賣日貨的商人，趁這機會漸漸的大家來經營國貨事業，販賣固好，改辦國貨工廠更好。在事實上販賣日貨，也許容易，可是給人譏笑·諷刺·唾駡，旣不値得·即在良心上，也覺得感受許多的痛苦。倒不如直捷了當的改辦國貨工廠，來得光明·正大·漂亮，嘴裏說得出。喉嚨喊得響，心裏放得下。雖在今日情勢之下辦國貨工廠，因爲種種的問題，或者要多用些心思·多費些力量，多經些艱難困苦，可是爲個人良心計，爲社會生計計，爲國家富力計，爲國際光榮計，爲民族生存計，爲子孫前途計，不能不舍易就難的來幹他一下，犧牲些精神，化費些才力，只要於社會於國家有貢獻，都是値得的。「放下屠刀立地成佛」快起來幹罷，快起來幹罷，我敬用一百二十分的誠意，來祝禱諸君的成功。</p>

<p>▲海軍與航業界之責任</p>
<p>抽調各地駐軍積極從事防水之主張。記者前已於「移軍隊與洪水作戰」一評中詳言之矣。但以目前情形言。防水固要圖。救急更迫切。據近日消息。武。</p>
<p>漢江漢水勢並漲。深逹五十餘英尺。全巿房屋。俱已没入水中。居民登樓攀樹。更有無屋可登無樹可攀者。則以棺代船。逐死屍以同浮水上。積水未减。漲勢猶熾。三鎭百八十萬人口。呼天無應。呼地無靈。惟有號泣以待末刧之來臨而同歸於盡。鳴呼。人世慘事。寗尙有逾於此者耶。</p>
<p>救急之道。第一救命。先救災黎出險。第二步乃圖所以善其後。然而洪水漂渺。彌望汪洋。雖救急有心。亦僅能望洋興嘆。誰能爲力。則惟有海軍及航業界。</p>
<p>我國海軍近年以來。頗呈朝氣。努力綏靖。救護商航。亦甚出力。邇年海疆無事。將士正多生撫髀之感。此次洪水侵襲。百萬同胞。槪在其迫害之下。海軍擁有水上之利器。而又膺有衛國保民之天職。急救災黎。力旣可及。責更應盡。雖多數砲艦。大半陳舊。以言噸數。不及英美百分之一。抗禦外侮。固嫌不足。而救護災黎。則綽有餘。尙有新造之咸寗永綏民權三艦。據海軍部言。航行長江。最稱適用。移以救濟災黎。自極得宜。就此三艦率帶小艇。作航業界之先鋒。駛往災地。援救災民出險。救急得策。實無逾此。上次鮮民排華。東北艦隊曾派艦前往救護。此次駐漢日本軍艦。始則築堤排水。繼則救渡日僑遷避。此種盡職之精神。實至足多。漢臯災民目擊日艦之拯救日僑。其希望我海軍援助之忱。果將何如。當仁不讓。見義勇爲。何况職之所在。萬民盼切。吾人敢繼言我海軍將士。必能奮然以興。伸其有力之援手。拯災民於垂死之絕域。</p>
<p>國内航海界如招商局。其航行長江流域者。共有輪十一艘。綜一萬四千一百餘噸。三北公司有輪四艘。綜一萬餘噸。連年對於軍事。勇於赴命。効力頗多。固已人所共見。際此百萬生靈待死水中。航業界有可盡之力。自更不忍惜我特力。坐看百萬同胞。同罹浩刦。而不命輪往救。聞目前各輪。有以災民擁擠登輪。恐重載沉没。不敢按期開駛者。傳聞之言。諒非事實。誰無骨肉。誰無親友。人之好善。誰不如我吾人當佇看兩公司派遣拯救災地同胞之船隻。絡繹於途。</p>
<p>至於外國航行我長江之輪船。如怡和公司共有輪六艘。綜一萬一千五百噸。如太古公司共有輪七艘。綜一萬四千餘噸。如日淸公司共有輪十艘。綜一萬八千五百餘噸。凡此外輪。吾人固不望其遂能助我。但基於救災卹鄰之意義上而言。其於救我災黎。實亦仗義者所當爲。且自航駛我内河以來。運貨年獲四百餘萬兩之鉅。略斥赢。餘救我災黎。尤有應盡之義務。至就此二十餘艘外輪。行駛我長江數十年。煤屑雜物。傾倒江中。日積月累。使我江底愈淺。江身愈隘而言。更有救我災黎之責任。此意記者敢特以貢獻於航行我内河之外國輪船公司。</p>
<p>假如海軍鼓輪於前。招商三北輪船絡繹而進。外輪復接踵於後。則人間地獄之災黎。庶其得以普渡。</p>

<p>人類在原始時代。或伏居石穴。成築巢樹巔。東西皆然。其後文化漸開。始有房屋。集成村落。然彼時生活亦頗簡單。最近德國考古家在哿龍尼郊外林德賽爾地方。發現石器時代人類所搆成之村落一所。此村搆造以來。迄今已有五千餘年之歷史。其搆造情形。與中世紀時代完全相同。村之四周。有壕溝一道圍之。深約七尺。寛十六尺。與壕溝相隔若干尺。則爲欄栅。係用柴木堆成。在壕溝之下。發現不少破碎之陶器小片。所有小屋之。宅基。現完好者。亦有數十處。惟搆屋方法。雜亂無章。全無系統。外觀方面。成彎曲形。四周爲木栅欄圍成之孔穴。即此一端。已可證明彼時之屋。完全以樹木搆成。有若干地方。地中有狹長之裂痕。或爲彼時居人用以使食物淸冷之法。此外尙發現矩圓形塲地若干、一處長度有七十尺之多。上面有不少木柱。惟並無家用物件。可見彼時生活之簡略。至陶器一物。此次發現者。爲數最多。他若石器時代人類所用之物。如手磨·火石刀·箭簇·手斧及獸骨製成之器物。均有大批發現。現聞該考古家擬將全數運往柏林博物院中陳列。以供國人之參考云。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>余自讀印度史。并觀察其社會組織。參與各種社會。恍然於中國以外之人民生活矣。觀印人擁戴敎首甘地之狀。乃知所謂婆羅門敎者。（此處從佛經說稍含輕視之意）其内容與佛敎大略。蓋未可輕視矣。試比較論之。世界各敎。在印度以東者。有儒釋道。在印度以西者。有回耶與印度敎。今爲六派。再加入舊帝國資本主義。及新生之俄馬克司派。又名爲八大派。言敎而政亦在其中也。第一中國爲民生主義之敎。自孔子務民之義。三代之七月流火九月授衣。漢之孝弟力田。宋明之耕讀講學皆然。不關於宗敎。此敎之簡章。非印人所喜。若道敎哲學。遠不及印度。非印人之敵也。若佛則缺乏倫理經濟組織。又不重神。已被印度敎戰敗而見逐於全印以外。（此印人之言。）中國三敎皆非印度敎之敵也。回敎挾以兵力。曾統治印度。然結果亦大失敗。决不足供印人之一顧。不能治印度也。耶敎缺乏哲理。在印度人觀之。不足以供研究。則回耶兩敎。經數百年之試騐。雖臨之以政治勢力。亦失敗於印度敎也。此世界上五大敎。皆非印度敎之敵。印度敎近且大傳播於美洲矣。而新佛又出甘地。聲勢浩大。大地震動。印人之崇拜甘地。名之爲神佛。過於中國之崇拜中山。美人之於華盛頓也。又印人之愛其妻。妻之愛其夫。子之愛其母。皆含神意。呼母爲女神。推之牛與全家以乳。故謂牛爲大母也。由此觀之。印人又深於情。總之世界五敎皆不足以動搖印度敎經數千年之試騐者也。</p>
<p>惟今後有兩大派出現。將與印度敎爲難。將如之何。一爲帝國資本主義。二爲俄之共産主義也。一帝國資本主義。印敎首甘地只用一粗大布孝帽與孝袍足以抵抗之。（確是中國喪明所用之物）一年中英人損失六萬萬。則帝國基礎已動搖。又不足以制印人死命。惟俄國主義。一般少年甚慕之。將來或是一問題。然吾觀甘地之徒。本從託爾士大等主義化書。又多曾在俄國有研究者。即使俄力能南下侵入印度。印度之决不致成爲生呑活剝之俄化明矣。吾意印度將來政治經濟社會三種組織。必在託爾士太與馬克司之間。創成一種新制度。婆羅門敎。余昔讀佛經時殊輕視之。今乃知其銅牆鐵壁。已與世界各主義磨鍊角逐而後存者也。</p>

<p>小榮的憤怒之火燄上，又彷彿加上了羞辱之油了；他會得把一切都在他的妻子身上發洩，突然的，他用力把他的妻子一拖，就什麽也不顧的從樓上一直拖到了樓下，再拖出了大門；雖然秋子在拉着他，丁小姐也唱止他，但什麽都失敗，只有容忍着這一幕悲劇的儘量發展。</p>
<p>雨下得更大了，雨點從不知道人們的痛苦，點點的儘向大地攻擊，雷像擂着戰鼓，電像放着前導的火炬，又加上了黯澹的雲，暴烈的風，益發顯出了這一刹那間的緊張。小榮是像一個瘋人，不，簡直是像一隻瘋狗樣的不曾知道這些，他開了丁家的大門，雖然這樣大的雨也不曾減少他的前進的怒氣；小榮的妻子是呼號地痛哭，一直由小榮拖着在地上滚去，眼涙幾乎哭出了血，聲也嘶啞了，力也竭盡了，更没有一個人能夠來阻擋着伊的丈夫的暴行。</p>

<p>海外各絲織廠、對於我國黃白絲經、雖有進胃、奈日絲開價較廉、致電轉絲價仍難上漲、華絲商虧本難售、昨祇緯成進滬白廠經現貨五包、連納進白乾經十包、美大進黃粗絲三包、價仍堅挺云、</p>

<p>米蘭各絲廠、前因暑假停工、繭銷停滯、加以俄繭侵銷、繭價奇跌、邇以各絲廠假滿開工、分起補購原料、繭價激漲、春乾繭價每基羅開九十一利立、夏乾繭七十八利拉、計各漲四五利拉云</p>

<p>昨洋莊茶巿、婺源屯溪等路之抽芯珍眉、杜德協和永興等行、均起搜辦、交易頗不寂寞、發源北鄉普通珍眉、頂盤業已開至一百九十二兩、屯溪珍眉、頂盤開至一百四十五兩、巿價至爲堅硬、其餘大帮針眉珠茶等項、去路均趨暢逹、貢熙綠茶、俄國協助會、雖持抑價態度、但茶數不多、英行紛起搜買、改裝他項花色出口、巿面亦均堅挺云、</p>

<p>近來需銷之夏令呢羢、有相繼落令之勢、蓋所銷之日無幾、買方均無需要訊矣、巴勅呢·胖别取·羽紗呢·未也勅·紗斜膠布等俱無去路、太陽呢及珠羅紗更乏人問津、白嗶嘰白直貢各號多皆售罄、買方需購亦缺、除黃斜紋法蘭羢逐日尙有零剪交易外、統皆過巿、大路售價、每碼平均跌數錢、</p>

<p>▲後巿防續升</p>
<p>五福白冰因久乏運到、號存單薄、故近巿由八兩九錢升至九兩一錢、昨日已完全兌通、存貨吿斷、當由經理號家大來華去電、催厦廠趕製速裝、大約旬日内可有續到、惟原料厦巿升起一元許、故號盤後巿或須再升也、</p>

<p>▲粗砂白廠盤開跌</p>
<p>昨日糖巿産區電訊、古巴現糖價無升沉、紐約期糖各月份續跌二分至五分、爪哇現期糖亦各跌一二五、公會劃盤交易均寥、荷糖二十四號粗砂白、新貨十一兩七錢至六錢七分半、香港貨十一兩六錢、陳貨十一兩四錢半、二十號中砂白十一兩一錢半、十八號十一兩、進出不多、巿形尙堅、太古糖Ｂ嘜十一兩一錢半、ＤＹ嘜十一兩六錢半至九錢二分半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩五錢半、需要較靜、巿象見平、抛貨荷糖南盛隆號兜九至十一月紛裝船新貨粗砂白價五元七角半、毫無受手、陳貨開出二百噸、價荷幣五元五角半、新規加稅、巿氣亦殊平平云、</p>

<p>英鋼板昨靑島·烟台·牛莊·營口諸帮相繼收辦、巿情頓形活潑、雖標準一時無上漲可能、然人心堅固、巿氣之膨脹、實爲今庚所未有、調查全巿開出、爲數逹六七百擔、而其後之欲繼續收辦者、大有人在、總觀環境、恐行情有重高之望云、刻巿二厘半售八兩五錢、半分六兩二錢半、七厘半六兩五錢、一分六兩、厚花色則估五兩七錢半云、</p>

<p>The Water Level Continued to Rise Last Night</p>
<p>The Yingbin Hotel Collapsed</p>
<p>The Salt Shortage is Also Extremely Worrying</p>
<p>(Hankou) On the 19th, the water receded by 3.5 inches, and on the 20th, it rose again by 1.5 inches. The water level was still rising last night. In Wuchang, the Wu Li Dike in Qingshan collapsed, and the area from Qingshan to Zhanggong Temple became a swamp. Except for Chang Street, the rest of the city was flooded. The number of collapsed houses in Hankou is increasing daily. The Yingbin Hotel collapsed yesterday, killing more than ten people. The number of refugees in various places is increasing daily. There are already 200,000 in Hankou, 50,000 in Wuchang, and 30,000 in Hanyang, plus 30,000 cart drivers and 100,000 dock workers. The emergency relief association has already spent more than 200,000 on relief efforts. The disaster victims will be moved to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to make a living. As for the disaster victims who have come from distant counties, they are waiting for relief in their respective areas. Several thousand people came to Wuchang yesterday and have not yet been allowed to land. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the whole country for relief of disaster victims. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) In the Hankou flood, the salt reserves were submerged. On the 13th, the walls of the Tong Maoqian, Quan Hetai, Chang Yuhe, and San Cang warehouses collapsed. Mitsubishi Corporation and others have also been flooded. It is estimated that Tong Maoqian has 17 tickets, Quan Hetai has 18 tickets, Chang Yuhe has 21 tickets, and Mitsubishi Corporation has 14 tickets. Merchants have been hiring workers to rescue the salt for days, but it is difficult to do so. On the 14th, the Xian'an warehouse was also flooded, and the others are also in critical condition. In addition, all seven tickets from Xindi were washed away by the flood. Merchants are suffering from a salt shortage and there is no way to remedy it. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level of the Yangtze River, which had been rising and falling, stopped at the highest record of 53 feet 6.5 inches on the water gauge yesterday morning. There are signs that the water level is gradually receding. The city's inundation this morning is about five inches less than at noon yesterday. The citizens have begun to turn their worries into relief. As for the increase in water volume, in addition to the increase in water from upstream, the high tide also has a considerable relationship. It is expected that the high tide will not increase again for the time being, and since the upstream has already decreased in water, the Wuhan market should also gradually recede. (Electric News Agency Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Ruiheng telegraphed from Hankou to Nanjing, reporting the severe flood situation in Hankou. He is currently working with various disaster relief organizations in Wuhan to jointly implement relief work and will return to Nanjing in three or four days. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>More Than a Thousand Villages in Qihe Wire for Help</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Personally Inspects Luokou</p>
<p>(Jinan) Last night, more than a thousand villages along the river in Qihe telegraphed the River Bureau and the Provincial Government, reporting the river's rise and the danger to the embankments, requesting emergency protection. At 5:00 this morning, Han Fuqu telephoned the River Bureau, ordering it to prepare 10,000 hemp bags. At 8:15, Han, accompanied by Wen Chenglie, went to Luokou by car. Han was wearing a white short jacket.</p>

<h3 id="e3">A Message to Pan Yang'an, a Seller of Japanese Goods <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Most merchants who sell Japanese goods probably don't do it willingly. They probably have a long history of doing so, not just a matter of a day or two. However, the Japanese are too cruel, their intentions are too insidious, and they are too immoral in international affairs. Our people endure hardship and pain, and with their bare hands, the only way to defeat them is through economic means. Therefore, not using Japanese goods and promoting domestic goods is the only weapon for our people to resist the Japanese at present. It is hoped that merchants who sell Japanese goods will take this opportunity to gradually engage in the domestic goods business. Selling domestic goods is good, but starting a domestic goods factory is even better. In fact, selling Japanese goods may be easy, but it is ridiculed, satirized, and spat upon. It is not worth it, and it also causes a lot of pain in one's conscience. It is better to directly and frankly start a domestic goods factory, which is more bright, upright, and beautiful. You can speak out about it, shout loudly about it, and be at peace with it in your heart. Although starting a domestic goods factory in today's situation may require more thought, more effort, and more hardship due to various problems, it is for one's own conscience, for the livelihood of society, for the wealth and strength of the country, for international glory, for the survival of the nation, and for the future of our descendants that we must choose the difficult path and sacrifice some energy and effort. As long as it contributes to society and the country, it is all worthwhile. "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Hurry up and do it, hurry up and do it. I sincerely wish you all success with 120% sincerity.</p>

<p>Wearing yellow trousers and looking like a worker, he inspected various dangerous works along the south bank of the Yellow River, passing through Beidianzi, Zhangzhuang, Caozhuang, and Duanzhuang to the Yu Fu River in Qihe. He returned to Jinan at 3:00 in the afternoon. Han told reporters that the situation in Qihe was not very critical and that the 5,000 hemp bags temporarily allocated were sufficient for emergency protection. The soldiers and civilians there were working hard to defend the area, and there was no need to send additional troops. Han addressed the supervising officers, soldiers, and civilians, encouraging them to work hard to protect the embankments and defend the area. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Luokou rose another two inches today, reaching a total height of 9 zhang 2 chi 9 cun above sea level. The downstream San Zong section telegraphed today, reporting that Wang Wangzhuang rose another two inches today. The current is fierce. At the 89th section of Fengjia and Wang Wang, more than 70 sections of the Qing embankment have been flooded, and the rest are level with the water. The most critical point of the embankment is only two chi above the water. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Bureau, went to the downstream Daoxu to supervise the construction. According to those familiar with river works, the upstream current has not yet arrived, and the middle and lower reaches are increasing by one or two inches. This is indeed a dangerous sign. Once the main current reaches the lower reaches, there is concern that a breach will occur at the border between Huimin and Lijin. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River downstream has risen by more than eight chi in recent days. The all embankments in Sunjia and Dama's areas in Lijin are covered with water, at depths of two chi, three chi, and four chi. The soil is washed away, the dams are collapsing, and the situation is extremely critical. At the same time, the works at Gongjia Dam, Qijia Mouth, and Wangzhuang are also under pressure. Han has dispatched a unit of handgun troops to Luokou for emergency protection. (Special Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The water level of the Yellow River at Luokou dropped three inches today, but the upstream rose one chi one cun, and the source is still very strong. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, went from Luokou to inspect the downstream Nanxia Wangwangzhuang Hujiatan. In addition to telegraphing the counties along the river to urge them to cooperate in the defense, Han Fuqu telegraphed the River Affairs Bureau today, ordering its subordinates to pay close attention to emergency protection. If there is any negligence, they will be severely punished without leniency. (Special Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Continue to Provoke Trouble in Qingdao City <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Strictly Prevented</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Inquired About the Case</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Shen Honglie on the 20th, ordering a detailed report on the case of Japanese violence. Several hundred Japanese thugs went to the Huantai Road area again on the night of the 19th to provoke trouble, but the Public Security Bureau had already taken precautions and they did not succeed. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications received a telegram from Liu Jingxi, the director of the Qingdao Telegraph Bureau, on the 20th, reporting the case of Japanese violence in Qingdao. At 9:00 last night, a Chinese merchant had an argument with a Japanese merchant over a minor matter, and the Japanese merchant used his wooden clogs to beat the Chinese man. When the Chinese man went to report to the police, a small number of people who were cooling off along the road saw what happened and called out to stop him. However, other Japanese people reported to support the Japanese merchant, and the number of people on both sides increased. The Japanese immediately telephoned the Guocui Society, which was set up by the Japanese to stir up trouble. While our police were mediating, dozens of Japanese people came with knives, guns, and wooden sticks and beat any Chinese they saw. After the military and police suppressed the violence, it subsided. As a result, three to five people were injured. Today, news dispatches from Japanese news agencies claimed that the Japanese were beaten, with more than 60 killed or injured, and that about 60 to 70 houses were destroyed. Some claimed that Japanese people at the pier and the bathing beach were beaten at the same time, and that this was a premeditated act and instigated by the anti-Japanese association. These rumors are far from the truth. After I collected these news dispatches, I consulted with the municipal government and agreed to delete the words "planned action" and "instigation" before sending them out, because it would be useless to detain them. They will send express mail that can arrive in a few days and falsely accuse us of suppressing the news and preventing it from being sent. How should this type of news be handled in the future? I await your instructions. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) After the Japanese Guocui Society murdered Chinese people, Japanese newspapers deliberately exaggerated the incident and held a meeting at the Japanese Residents' Association at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th, resolving to ask their government to send warships to protect overseas Chinese. Their intention is to provoke an incident and use it as an excuse to reoccupy Qingdao. The municipal government has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese consulate. Although the public is extremely angry, they are maintaining a stable attitude to support the government. The Journalists' Association and various organizations will hold an emergency meeting to express their views on the case. (China News Agency Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report on the case of Japanese violence in Qingdao, it immediately sent a telegram to inquire about the truth of the incident. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Consulate in Nanjing telegraphed the Japanese Consulate in Qingdao to investigate the details of the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese. According to Japanese sources, this matter can be resolved directly by the local authorities. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Russian Warships Demonstrate in Tongjiang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Artillery Exercises Outside Sanjiangkou</p>
<p>Chinese Merchant Ships Suspended</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Jiangfang Naval Fleet Headquarters received a telegram from Tongjiang, reporting that a total of 14 Russian warships and 6 seaplanes conducted artillery exercises outside Sanjiangkou on the morning of the 19th. Chinese merchant ships traveling to the Wujiang and Heilongjiang regions were terrified and stopped, not daring to sail downstream. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Shipping Affairs Bureau received a telegram from Zhang Xihou, the county magistrate of Tongjiang, on the 19th, stating that five large and six small Russian warships arrived outside Sanjiangkou on the evening of the 18th. The large ships were docked at Xuergu, across from Tongjiang, and the small ships were docked outside the port. On the morning of the 19th, ten planes flew from the direction of Boli and landed at Xuergu over the territory of Fuyuan County. Their intentions are unclear. The Sanjiang waterway has been cut off and the situation is tense. The Tongjiang Customs Office also telegraphed on the 19th, requesting the temporary suspension of ship services between Heihe and Wujiang. All government and merchant ships had already sold tickets on the 19th, but the services were temporarily suspended. The Harbin Shipping Bureau urgently telegraphed the ships from Heihe and Hulin to stop and return to the docks, ordering them to dock on our shore and await developments. The Naval Jiangfang Department telegraphed the Lisui warship, which was docked in Yilan, to sail to the Fujin area for reconnaissance. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The reason for the Russian warships' arrival at Jiangkou this time is that Russian merchants are purchasing grain downstream for export. The Russians have purchased 2 million hectares of soybeans, but only 60,000 hectares have been shipped out by sailing ships. They fear that the goods will be seized, so they are putting on a show of force. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japan is deploying the entire 16th Division from the Kyoto area to Daegu, Mokpo, Daejeon, and other places in Korea. The 19th and 20th Divisions, which were originally stationed in Korea, are being redeployed to the Tumen River area. Their purpose is not difficult to guess. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>The Cabinet will Discuss Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The third note on the Korean incident has been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is being reviewed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In addition to requesting the fulfillment of the various items in the second note, it also refutes the various reasons given by the Japanese side in its second reply. The compensation part is still divided into life and property losses, and it is stated that the Japanese side must be responsible for investigating the whereabouts of the missing overseas Chinese due to the incident. The Japanese government should fully guarantee that the property of the overseas Chinese who returned to China due to the incident is not damaged. It is also requested that the Japanese side declare and guarantee that Koreans will not engage in anti-Chinese activities in the future. After it is submitted to the 22nd National Government meeting, Jiang and the members of the various committees will discuss it before finalizing the draft and sending it.

<h3 id="e8">British Warships Anchor in Zhenjiang <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Excuses to Protect British Nationals</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The British concession in Zhenjiang was taken back long ago, but the British side, using the Tao Peng case as an excuse, sent the warship "Tees" to Zhenjiang. It openly notified the Public Security Bureau that the ship was anchored in Zhenjiang to protect British nationals and set up a naval club in the old British consulate. Ye Chucang sent a letter to the government requesting it to stop this, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is sending a note to the British ambassador requesting that they leave Zhenjiang immediately.

Later, when the bandits were exhausted and out of ammunition, our troops charged and attacked them. Many bandits threw away their guns and fled. According to the bandits, although they had three cannons, they had no ammunition. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) General Jiang sent a telegram stating that after the bandits in Xingguo were severely suppressed, a part of them hid in Gaoxingxu. Because they were out of ammunition and food, they fled and surrendered. The bandits in Yongfeng and Liangcun were severely attacked and fled to Longgang, and a small part fled to Changting. Because our army blocked them, they suffered heavy casualties. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>

Since the start of the expedition, we have successively captured Tengtian, Shaxi, Shima, and Longgang to enter Donggu. On the 6th, when we advanced to Liangcun and Liantang, three fake army corps of bandits used the dense mountains and forests to heavily encircle us, outnumbering us by six or seven times. Shangguan personally led the 47th and 54th Divisions to fight fiercely for four days and nights. When we ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, we continued with bayonets. The soldiers regarded death as if they were returning home, and finally killed tens of thousands of bandits. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>

Jiang was wearing a white linen long gown with a black armband on his left arm. He was full of energy. After getting off the train, he nodded and smiled at the people who welcomed him and walked out of the platform. He got into car No. 526 and returned to his private residence to rest.

<p>(Beiping) About one regiment of Liu Guitang's remnant troops in Daming surrendered their weapons and withdrew outside the city to be reorganized. Liu himself fled beforehand. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Heiqi's troops in Daming requested Catholic priests from the Catholic Church to ask the Central Army to stop shooting, saying that they were willing to hand over their troops to avoid devastating the area. After the priests negotiated with the Central Army twice, military action was stopped at 6:00 p.m. On the morning of the 19th, Xu Tingyao and Tang Yunshan's troops disarmed all of Liu's troops. Order was fully restored in Daming. After the matter was resolved, Tang Yunshan's brigade will go to western Henan, and Xu Tingyao's troops plan to go to Shunde. Chen Dexian's brigade of Han Fuqu's troops arrived 30 li away from Daming. Upon hearing that Liu's troops had been resolved, they turned back to their original defense. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Liu Zhi's representative, Li Guosheng, came to Jinan to visit Han and Jiang Bocheng to discuss important matters.

<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun met with reporters, saying that he absolutely obeyed the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and that there would be no more wars in the north. Every time a war breaks out, it is said to be for the country and the people, but in the end, it harms the country and the people. In this war, for example, Yuanshi County had to collect 128,000 yuan in cash and provide more than 900 carts. The county's total land tax for the whole year is only 90,000 yuan, but it had to pay hundreds of thousands of yuan in an instant. As for the losses suffered by the people from the artillery fire and looting, they are not included. How can we soldiers not feel ashamed? The defense area of our troops has been designated as Hejian, Wuqiang, and Xianxian. As long as our army has food to eat, there will be no problems. Our division will be expanded into an army. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief has indeed given this direction, but I absolutely do not pay attention to the name. An army is valued for its quality, not its quantity. After I meet with Xu Yongchang and Shen Kelai in Beiping, I will return to the defense area. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun telegraphed his deputy division commander, Feng Fawu, saying, "I will return to Shijiazhuang in three to five days and depart immediately. I will station my brigade in Xianxian and send a unit to Wuqiang. The division headquarters and Chen's brigade will be stationed in Hejian and nearby towns. All important figures in Beiping, such as Yu Xuezhong, have visited Pang for discussions. Zhang Xueming hosted Pang at his private residence." (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen's and Gao Guizi's defense areas have been designated by the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's headquarters as Shunde, Shahe, Cixian, Handan, Wu'an, etc. Shang's headquarters will be set up in Shunde, and Shang's division headquarters will be set up in Wu'an. Now, because the Central Army is demobilizing, they are gradually moving south. The people of Shunde, because the area is empty, have specially sent representatives to Shijiazhuang to welcome Shang's troops and ask them to quickly fill the defense. Shang has ordered a regiment of Gao's brigade to move to Shunde on foot. The rest will wait for the Northeast Army to take over the defense of Shijiazhuang before moving south with Gao's division. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government and Zhang Xueliang have agreed on a policy to stabilize the north: (1) The troops stationed in northwestern Shanxi will be moved to Hebei to reduce the burden on Shanxi.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government has sent the central budget for the 20th year to the Central Political Council for review. The estimated expenditure is 95 million, and the estimated income is 76 million, with a deficit of more than 170 million. The expenditure part includes the reserve funds, temporary expenses, and special expenses of various agencies, and the regular expenses can be vigorously compressed and reduced after review. The tariff income part is estimated by the Ministry of Finance according to the current minimum level. In the future, the final accounts of tariff income should exceed the current estimated budget. In addition, the business problem of the railways directly under the Ministry of Railways is also under review. Once it has been reviewed by the Central Political Council, a comprehensive plan will be formulated to ensure that income and expenditure meet and then it will be announced. (Special Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the central budget for the 20th year, the Central Political Council held a discussion on the 19th.

<p>(Nanjing) Cai Yuanpei discussed the Guangdong situation, saying that Zhang Puquan and Wu Tiecheng have recently been consulting with Guangdong on a peaceful resolution. As to the degree of progress, we have not yet received a concrete report here, but for the sake of the party and the country, and for the sake of the people, we must move towards peace. Even in terms of the current situation in Guangdong, it is not advantageous to use force. The central government has always been unwilling to meet with soldiers, all of which can be proved by the facts. Party disputes are based on theory, and a solution should be found within the party. Any other way is against the correct path. It is rumored that Zhihui will go to Beiping and Puquan will go to Guangdong, but as far as I know, this may not be true. In short, it would be fortunate if the Guangdong affair could be resolved before the National Congress, and all comrades in the central government are thinking the same thing.

<p>(Beiping) Liu Shangqing arrived in Beiping from Beidaihe on the morning of the 20th to visit Zhang. Liu told reporters that he was still recovering from his brain illness and planned to rest at the seaside for a few more days.

<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Yongchang received reporters from various newspapers inside and outside the province at the Provincial Government at 4 p.m. Xu reported the significance of the reception: (1) He had been unfamiliar with the press and now bears full political responsibility for the province, so contact is necessary. (2) Shanxi is still in a very difficult period, and he hopes the press will help to overcome the difficulties. He then responded to questions from the reporters: (A) The Shanxi generals unanimously support the central government and maintain unification, and their attitude is very clear. (B) Feng moved to Fenyang after the Song army was transferred. Rumors of meeting with Yan or coming to Taiyuan are not accurate. The Feng army in Fenyang has not yet been transferred.

The remaining amount will be covered by entrance fees, advertising, and product displays. The preparation period is set at one year. After receiving the consultation, the Ministry of Industry stated that imported wheat and flour account for approximately 200 million yuan per year, and that aquatic products and canned food account for more than 300 million yuan. Given the severity of the food shortage, the public must understand this issue and promote improved planting to alleviate the situation.

<h3 id="e34">Appealing for the Victims of the Wuhan Flood <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>▲ Responsibilities of the Navy and Maritime Industry</p>
<p>The proposal to deploy troops stationed in various locations to actively engage in flood prevention has already been discussed in detail in a previous commentary entitled "Move Troops to Fight Floods." However, given the current situation, flood prevention is important, but emergency relief is even more pressing. According to recent news, the Yangtze and Han Rivers have both risen, reaching a depth of more than fifty feet. The houses in the entire city have been submerged in water. Residents are climbing onto buildings and trees, and those who have no buildings or trees to climb are using coffins as boats, floating alongside corpses. The floodwaters have not receded, and the rising tide continues. The 1.8 million residents of the three towns are crying out to heaven and earth without response, weeping and waiting for the final calamity to come and perish together. Alas, are there any more tragic events in the world than this?</p>
<p>The first step in emergency relief is to save lives, first rescuing the disaster victims from danger, and then figuring out how to take care of them afterwards. However, the floodwaters are vast and boundless, and even with the intention to provide emergency relief, one can only sigh helplessly. Who can help? Only the navy and the maritime industry.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's navy has shown vigor and has been working hard to maintain peace and protect commercial navigation. With no incidents on the seas in recent years, officers and soldiers have felt a sense of uselessness. This time, a flood has struck, and millions of compatriots are suffering. The navy possesses superior water-based equipment and bears the responsibility of defending the country and protecting the people. Rescuing the disaster victims is within its ability and is its duty. Although the majority of the warships are old and outdated, their tonnage is less than one percent of that of the United States and Great Britain. They may be inadequate for resisting foreign aggression, but they are more than capable of rescuing disaster victims. There are also the newly built "Xianning," "Yongsui," and "Minquan" ships. According to the Ministry of the Navy, these ships are well-suited for navigating the Yangtze River. Deploying them to provide relief to disaster victims is most appropriate. These three ships can lead small boats and act as the vanguard of the maritime industry, sailing to the disaster area and rescuing disaster victims from danger. There is no better strategy for emergency relief. Last time, when Korean citizens discriminated against Chinese, the Northeast Fleet sent ships to rescue them. This time, the Japanese warships stationed in Wuhan first built dikes to drain water and then rescued and evacuated Japanese residents. This dedication is commendable. When the Hanyang disaster victims witnessed the Japanese warships rescuing Japanese residents, how would they feel about the hope of the Chinese navy assisting them? We should not refuse to do what is right and should bravely do what is just, especially since it is our duty and the people are eagerly awaiting it. We dare to say that the officers and soldiers of the navy will rise up and extend their helping hands to rescue the disaster victims from the brink of death.</p>
<p>The domestic maritime industry, such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has a total of eleven ships navigating the Yangtze River basin, with a total tonnage of over 14,100 tons. The Sanbei Company has four ships with a total tonnage of over 10,000 tons. They have bravely fulfilled their duties in military matters for many years and have made many contributions, which is well known. With millions of lives waiting to die in the water, the maritime industry has the power to help and should not spare its strength, watching millions of compatriots suffer a great calamity without sending ships to the rescue. It is heard that some ships are afraid that the disaster victims will crowd onto the ships, causing them to sink due to overloading, and dare not sail on schedule. This is probably not true. Who has no relatives? Who has no friends? Everyone likes to do good deeds. We are all the same. We should wait and see the ships of the two companies dispatching ships to rescue compatriots in the disaster area, one after another.</p>
<p>As for foreign ships navigating the Yangtze River, such as Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., there are six ships with a total tonnage of over 11,500 tons. Tai-Koo Company has seven ships with a total tonnage of over 14,000 tons. Nippon Yusen Kaisha has ten ships with a total tonnage of over 18,500 tons. We do not expect these foreign ships to help us, but based on the meaning of disaster relief and helping neighbors, helping our disaster victims is what righteous people should do. Furthermore, since sailing on our inland rivers, they have earned more than four million taels of silver per year in freight. They should use some of their profits to help our disaster victims, which is their duty. As for these twenty foreign ships operating on the Yangtze River for decades, pouring coal slag and debris into the river, making the riverbed shallower and the river narrower, they have an even greater responsibility to help our disaster victims. We dare to offer this suggestion to foreign shipping companies operating on our inland rivers.</p>
<p>If the navy sets sail, the China Merchants and Sanbei ships follow one another, and the foreign ships follow behind, then the disaster victims in the human hell can be rescued.</p>

<p>Urging Germany to Strive to Promote Export Trade</p>
<p>No Practical Proposal on Revising Reparations</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Basel, 19th: The report of the International Bankers' Committee was published today, containing the following words: Germany believes that there are several reasons for immediately revising the reparations proposal, but the report did not make a practical proposal for revising reparations. However, it indicated the impact of Germany's foreign debt and the danger of continuing to borrow large amounts of foreign debt to pay for reparations in a very cautious manner. The report also stated that this situation would cause Germany to conduct large-scale dumping, which would harm other countries. Germany's short-term debt is currently 7.4 billion marks, and in the past seven months, 2.9 billion marks of short-term debt have been withdrawn from Germany. Foreign creditors have agreed with German debtors to immediately sell a portion of the debtor's assets in marks, with the remainder being repaid gradually. Germany urgently needs to strictly restrict imports and develop its export trade in order to improve its currency value.</p>

<p>Moving Away from Italy and Toward France</p>
<p>▲ Budapest Telegram from the National News Agency on the 19th: Foreign Minister Count Károlyi has agreed to form a new cabinet today, which is expected to be established by Friday. There will be no changes in the cabinet members or policies. The rumor that former Prime Minister Count Bethlen would form a new cabinet is a misunderstanding. Although officials stated that Count Bethlen's resignation was due to his retirement after serving as Prime Minister since April 14, 1921, for ten years, it is widely speculated in political circles that Bethlen's resignation is related to the loan negotiations in Paris. Bethlen's departure would remove an obstacle to France granting Hungary a loan. Bethlen is the leader of the Unity Party, which he reorganized once on September 1, 1929. It is generally believed that after the fall of the Unity Party government, Hungary will distance itself from Italy and actively move closer to France.</p>

The head of the construction department believes that if the current plan proceeds, the new building will cost 42 million Swiss francs upon completion, double the original price. The architects claim they bear no responsibility for this.</p>

Two climbers were crushed by falling rocks and are seriously injured, in danger of death. Between the major eruptions, there were continuous minor eruptions. Lava fell around the surrounding three chō (approximately 327 meters), and the foothills were covered with small stones and fine ash. As a result, orchards and mulberry fields in the Karuizawa area were destroyed. A forest near the Miyagahara Station caught fire due to the hot lava, causing significant damage.

Her lecture will take place at the International Conference for the Study of Population on September 7. However, Stopes has been warned not to promote anything, and her lecture must remain within the realm of pure science. When the news that Stopes was invited to lecture in Rome was first published, authorities immediately denied it, stating that Italian women's duty is to raise children for the nation. It is ridiculous to say that Italy would allow someone to disseminate birth control information in the country. However, Stopes dismissed this denial as meaningless and was determined to go to Rome to lecture. Now, according to recent news, it seems Stopes will have her wish.</p>

<p>⊙ Telegram from Hanshan to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: Hanshan has suffered repeated droughts in recent years, and the people's strength has been exhausted. Unfortunately, disaster has struck again. In July of this year, torrential rain fell for more than twenty days, day and night, like a downpour. Mountain floods erupted, and rivers overflowed. With the lake water flowing down and the river tide pushing up, all the dikes in the county collapsed one after another, without exception. Autumn crops were submerged, and houses were washed away. When the flood was at its peak, the raging waves were like ten thousand horses galloping. In an instant, they had crossed the rooftops. Residents who could not escape were swept away by the waves. Now that the flood has subsided slightly, nearly 100,000 people have no homes to return to and no food to eat. The disaster is severe and unprecedented in nearly a century. Therefore, we urgently implore your esteemed newspaper to consider the disaster victims, who are crying out for food, and to promptly publish this request for urgent relief to save the lives of 100,000 dying people. We are waiting anxiously for your order. Please show your compassion. The Hanshan Relief Committee for Flood Victims bows in reverence, Xiǎn.</p>

Not only were the fields and crops completely submerged, but the entire city was also flooded. The people's food supply is exhausted, and livestock have died without exception. Refugees fleeing the flood are perched precariously on treetops and rooftops, their cries of distress shaking the fields. It is unbearable to hear. Considering that the region has suffered repeated disasters, its vitality has been exhausted. The financial institutions are empty, and the dangerous situation is indescribable. We earnestly request prompt relief and the dispatch of personnel to investigate and distribute aid to save the disaster victims. We are urgently awaiting your order, etc." Therefore, we specially request you to publish this telegram to appeal for help in saving the lives of tens of thousands of disaster victims who are awaiting death. We are extremely anxious. The Xinghua County Provisional Disaster Relief Committee bows in tears, Hán.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Central Committee Holds Memorial Service for Liao Zhongkai's Martyrdom <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service today (the 20th) to commemorate the sixth anniversary of Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom. Attendees included Zhu Jiahua, Jiao Yitang, Fang Juehui, Zhou Qigang, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Wang Boqun, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Miao Peicheng, Chen Zhaoying, Chen Lifu, Shao Yuanchong, as well as staff and guests, totaling approximately 600 people.

Chairman Fang Juehui delivered a speech, stating in brief: "Our annual commemoration of the martyr Mr. Liao must have far-reaching significance and value. Mr. Liao was a very revolutionary member of our party. During the Republic of China era, the party became corrupt. Mr. Liao helped the Premier reorganize the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In 1917, some corrupt members of the party colluded with the Political Studies Clique to oppose the Premier. Mr. Liao followed the Premier to Shanghai to publish the Construction Magazine. In 1922, Mr. Liao had a plan to unify military and financial affairs. In 1924, he assisted the Premier in reorganizing the Kuomintang, revitalizing its spirit, and founding the Whampoa Military Academy. The current Chairman Chiang serves as the principal, and the party representative was Mr. Liao. His spirit was demonstrated by personally engaging in mass work in his capacity as a minister. Today, we should commemorate Mr. Liao's spirit and the greatness of his revolutionary personality. Mr. Liao managed the finances for several years but ended up with nothing. This is the value of Mr. Liao that is worth commemorating," etc. Next, Wu Zhihui delivered a speech, stating in brief: "On August 20, 1925, Mr. Liao was martyred, and the party lost a useful talent. The eight characters in our Party Song, 'Swear to be diligent and brave, and must be faithful and loyal,' can be applied to Mr. Liao without any embarrassment. Mr. Liao also had the ability to build. It is a pity that he sacrificed himself while he was struggling. Our annual commemoration is like getting a shot of morphine. Even if it is only five minutes of heat, it should be exciting. I hope everyone will learn from the virtues of the martyrs. Confucius said, 'If one does not violate benevolence for three months, one may be considered benevolent.' The meaning of our commemoration lies in this." Subsequently, the conclusion of the ceremony was announced, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Dangerous Situation on the Yellow River Near Jinan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>▲ Stone Dam at Luokou Collapses by Several Zhang (Units of Length)</p>
<p>▲ Only Forty Li (Units of Length) from Jinan</p>
<p>▲ Yellow River Water Rises Above the Danger Line</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River's water level rose another three inches last night (the 18th). The Luokou water gauge north of the city has reached a height of nine zhang three chi one cun above sea level, exceeding the danger line by one cun. The entire riverbank feels increasingly dangerous. Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, immediately set out to supervise the emergency repairs. However, shortly after arriving at Luokou, the North Diansi in Changqing County, thirty li northwest of Luokou on the south bank, experienced a dangerous situation as several zhang of the stone dam collapsed. The area is only forty li from Jinan and is of critical importance. In case of an accident, Jinan's low-lying terrain would be unimaginable. Zhang Lianjia convened an urgent meeting that evening in Luokou, attended by the district heads of the ninth and tenth districts of Jinan City, the director of the Luokou Public Security Bureau, and the staff of various sections of the midstream. They planned emergency repairs. It is noted that North Diansi has historically had the fewest dangerous sections in the midstream of the Yellow River in Shandong Province and has the most solid stone dam. Now that even it has experienced a dangerous situation, the danger in the upstream and downstream areas, which are riddled with holes and historically have many dangerous sections, can be imagined. (19th)</p>
<p>Another Telegram: The Yellow River's water level is rising rapidly, and telegrams reporting emergencies upstream and downstream are arriving like snowflakes. The Tangjia in Huimin and the Sunjia in Lijin on the north bank downstream, the Wangwangzhuang in Putai on the south bank, and the Miannian in Kangtun and the Liu Zhuang Zhukou in Puyang County and the Miannian in Liuyuan on the north bank upstream are all extremely dangerous. Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju has telegraphed the public security bureau chiefs and county magistrates of the twenty-two counties along the river and the director of the River Affairs Bureau, Zhang Lianjia, ordering them to go to the worksite immediately to supervise and order emergency repairs. According to a person from the River Affairs Bureau, when the Gongjia Dam breached ten years ago, the Luokou water gauge was only nine zhang five chi. Now, it has been found that the water that rose three chi four cun six fen two li in Shaanxi on the 17th has not yet reached Jinan. The water level in Shandong Province has already reached nine zhang two chi eight cun. If that water arrives, it will definitely rise to more than nine zhang five chi, and there is a risk of a breach. All the staff of the River Affairs Bureau have been working day and night since the 17th, extremely busy. Due to continuous heavy rain, the autumn crops in Liaocheng in western Shandong have been submerged, resulting in a flood. As of the 15th, it was still raining non-stop. Suddenly, it was reported that the Tuhai River south of the city had breached by several zhang, and the area near the city walls had become a swamp. The 87th Brigade Commander Rong Guangxing, upon hearing the news, immediately led more than 2,000 officers and soldiers stationed in Liaocheng to rush to the emergency repairs. At the time, it was raining heavily, and the water was surging. Finally, thanks to the valiant efforts of the officers and soldiers, the repairs were completed by 6:00 PM. Fortunately, it was successful. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Lu Han Temporarily Postpones Trip to Peiping <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reason is Reorganization of the Shi Department</p>
<p>▲ The Shi Department Will Be Temporarily Organized into a Brigade</p>
<p>▲ Han's Troops Deployed to Attack Liu's Department</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Shi Yousan Department was resolved, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, in response to the aftermath of the situation in North China, summoned generals from all parties to consult. He recently invited Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju to Peiping. Today, a reporter visited Han and asked if the travel date had been set. Han said that he could not go to Peiping temporarily due to the reorganization of the Shi Department. If there were important events in the future, he might have to go to Peiping. As for the reorganization of the Shi Department, because it originally had only more than 5,000 people, it could not be organized into a division. Therefore, it was planned to incorporate it into the Zhan Shutang Department and expand the Zhan Brigade into the 73rd Division, with Zhan being promoted to division commander. According to news from the headquarters today, after several consultations on the reorganization of the Shi Department, it has now been decided to reorganize it into a temporary brigade based on the current number of personnel, with Shi's chief of staff, Tang Bangzhi, appointed as the brigade commander. The number has not yet been determined. Once the reorganization is complete, it will remain in Jinan for training. It is noted that the Shi Department, which surrendered to Lu, has successively arrived in Jinan in full from Yucheng as of yesterday (the 17th) and should be able to begin reorganization within days. Also, according to news here, there are still more than a thousand people in the Shi Department in Hebei Province who wanted to surrender to Lu and be absorbed. While traveling to the northwest of Zaoqiang County, they were intercepted by the Northeast Army and completely resolved, preventing them from coming south.</p>
<p>Han Fuju's representative, Song Shiyan, previously accompanied Deputy Zhang's representatives, Fan Pujiang and Ge Guangting, to Peiping to meet Zhang and report on the progress of the reorganization of the Shi Department. Today, Song returned to Jinan from Peiping. According to reports, the Deputy Commander fully agreed with Chairman Han's absorption and reorganization of the Shi Department. The overall situation in North China is calm.</p>
<p>As always, the generals of the Northwest Army and the Jin Army unanimously support the Central Government and will not be affected by Yan's return to Jin. The Deputy Commander is very willing to work with Chairman Han to maintain the overall situation in the North.</p>
<p>Han Fuju recently received orders to send troops to resolve the Liu Guitang Department in Daming. He ordered the 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin to command the Li Hanzhang Brigade and the Li Xuande Cavalry Brigade to take the road through En County, Xiajin, and Weixian to Daming. Today, Li Hanzhang returned to Dezhou from Jinan to defend the border. According to Li, he was ordered to go to Daming to attack the Liu Guitang Department but was unable to bear the heavy responsibility due to illness. Chairman Han has now reassigned the Chen Dexin Department of the 86th Brigade to go, still under the command of Division Commander Cao, along with the Cavalry Brigade, Li Xuande. A heavy mortar company from the 29th Division was also transferred from Dezhou to join them. They arrived in Pingyuan today and will be mobilized tomorrow (the 19th), taking the road through Guantao to Daming. It is said that the Li Xuande Department will be mobilized today. Division Commander Cao is still in Yucheng. The Liu Guitang Department in Daming City has about a thousand people and intends to hold their ground. (August 18)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Continued Reports on the Tragic Murder of Jinan Female Teacher Zhu Shude <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wang and Zhu Definitely Had a Relationship</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju spoke today (the 18th) on the suicide case of Zhu Shude, a teacher at the Second Provincial Elementary School of Shandong. The reason for Zhu Shude's suicide has now been clarified. It has been confirmed that Zhu Shude and Wang Weijun had a relationship. Because she suffered great pain as a result of the relationship, she committed suicide. Therefore, Wang Weijun is ultimately responsible. Wang is the section chief of the Education Department and has now been suspended from his duties. This case is different from that of Bai Wan, where heroin was involved; it should be resolved by law.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th) was Sunday, and the court was not open for business. However, a special investigative court was convened for the Zhu case, with Chief Prosecutor Li in attendance. Only Wang Weijun's female servant, Chen Wangshi, was interrogated. Her testimony was largely the same as before: (1) There is a handgun in Wang Weijun's home, which she had seen before; (2) Wang Weijun and Zhu Shude had a relationship and had cohabited, which is true. As for whether she had given birth to a child, she did not know; (3) The affairs of the Wang family were known to almost all the neighbors. Based on Chen Wangshi's testimony, the court convened another investigative court today and specially summoned Wang Weijun's neighbors to inquire about Wang and Zhu's relationship. The neighbors testified that they did not know. When asked whether the Wang family's female servant testified that the neighbors knew about it, they replied that they heard about the Wang family having a handgun but did not know anything else. The court immediately adjourned. Wu Zhen, president of the High Court, went to the Provincial Public Security Bureau this morning to consult the household registration register and confirmed that Wang Weijun did indeed cohabit with Zhu Shude at No. 31 Xiaowangfu Street between July and August of last year. The name on the household registration register was Wang Shiheng.</p>
<p>According to Zhu Meirong, a relative of Zhu Shude, when the court opened on the 15th, she wanted to describe in detail Wang Weijun's seduction of Zhu Shude and their cohabitation on Xiaowangfu Street, but the judge did not allow her to speak, and she did not know why. It was discovered that Wang Weijun had formally married Zhu Shude in Qingdao when the Jin Army arrived in Jinan last year. After returning to Jinan, Shude became pregnant, and Liu Hesheng (Wang's wife) became jealous and did not allow Zhu to cohabit with Wang at the Wang residence. She moved to No. 31 Xiaowangfu Street (the newly replaced porcelain door number 30) to live. After I found out, I personally visited the place and was told by her female servant that it was Wang's mansion and refused to see me. Later, I wrote a letter in my own hand, addressed to Mrs. Wang, Shude to receive, and was able to see Zhu Shude. On the small building in the courtyard, she told me about being seduced by Wang Weijun. It has now been discovered that Wang Weijun changed his name to Wang Shiheng (serving as a section chief in the Education Department) when he registered his household in Xiaowangfu Street, and the wife was Zhu. Since it was registered as wife Zhu, it shows that he had married Zhu Shude. Also, Education Department Director He Siyuan said that at the beginning of this case, the court came to the scene to inspect and found that the deceased was indeed a virgin and had no relationship with Wang Weijun. Wang was a recommended official, so the Education Department did not suspend him from his duties that day. Now that the court has detained him to investigate his relationship with this case, the Education Department also suspended him from his position as section chief yesterday, pending a legal resolution. Also, according to news from the court, this case will be prosecuted. After many days of investigation, it has been determined that Zhu Shude did commit suicide, and her suicide note has been proven to be in her own handwriting and is not a forgery.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Minutes of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Passed a proposal to revitalize the province's politics</p>
<p>▲ And determined six articles of administrative and operational methods</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th) was the sixth day of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Congress. At 8 a.m., a memorial service for Liao Zhongkai was held, attended by 89 representatives. The presidium nominated Huang Yuren as chairman, who led the ceremony. The chairman reported, stating briefly that the gathering of representatives from all counties of the province to commemorate Mr. Liao had even greater significance. First, Mr. Liao was targeted and attacked by reactionaries for advocating the unification of military, civil, and financial administration. However, in today's China, these three have not been unified. We should continue his legacy and complete this important mission. Second, Mr. Liao consistently supported and upheld the party. Today, the party affairs in Jiangsu are disorganized, the discipline is lax, and the strength is weak. We should follow Mr. Liao's spirit of hard work, focus our efforts on party affairs in the province, enforce strict discipline, and strengthen the organization. Third, Mr. Liao served as the Minister of Agriculture and Labor and paid close attention to the lives of farmers and workers. We should emulate him and carry out practical work in the mass movement. The ceremony concluded at 9 a.m., followed by the fourth general assembly, chaired by Huang Yuren. First, the minutes of the previous meeting were read. Xu Wenjun, the representative of the proposal review committee, reported that 92 proposals were received yesterday, combining with over 200 existing ones, and very few have been resolved. A faster method of discussion is needed. Next, the proposals were discussed: (1) Proposal to revitalize the province's politics (submitted by the Provincial Party Rectification Committee). Ma Yinbing first gave a detailed explanation, including promoting local autonomy, rectifying officialdom, eliminating accumulated land tax malpractices, improving the judiciary, and improving education. Representatives Wang Zhongjun, Jiang Yanqiu, Luo Decheng, Huang Songtao, Cai Peifu, Zhao Yuzheng, Tang Kesheng, Liu Jian, Xi Hanping, Xin Yutang, Zhuang Minqiu, Qiu Youling, Wang Gongyu, Ge Jianshi, Ma Wenzao, etc., expressed their opinions. As a result of the discussion, all opinions were submitted to another review committee for review. The review committee consisted of seven members, with a double number of candidates introduced by the presidium. The following were elected by all representatives: Liu Jian, Wang Gongyu, Qiu Youzhen, Ma Wenzao, Peng Liren, Xin Yutang, Peng Binghou, with Liu Jian designated as convener. (2) Request for the Provincial Government to set a deadline for reducing the number of police teams in each county and to organize local defense groups in each township and district (submitted by representatives from Gaochun, etc.). (3) Proposal to increase the powers of county magistrates to facilitate county administration and accountability (submitted by representatives from Wujin, etc.). (4) Proposal to complete the land survey in the province as soon as possible to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood (submitted by representatives from Jiangning, etc.). (5) Proposal to divide the stages and set a deadline for completing county autonomy to realize provincial autonomy (submitted by representatives from Fengxian, etc.). (6) Proposal to abolish the public security mu tax to reduce the burden on farmers (submitted by representatives from Jiangning, etc.). It was resolved that the above six proposals be combined and submitted to the review committee for the proposal to revitalize the province's politics for review. (7) Proposal to temporarily suspend the police academy (submitted by representatives from Jiangyin, etc.). After the proposal was put forward, the representatives debated fiercely whether to approve it. As it was past 12 o'clock, many representatives requested to postpone the discussion until the afternoon. The chairman then announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m., the fifth general assembly was held, chaired by Huang Yuren, with 77 representatives present. The discussion continued: (1) Proposal to temporarily suspend the police academy. It was resolved to pass it according to the review opinion. Attached review opinion: It is natural to run a police academy, but the management is not perfect. The Civil Affairs Department should thoroughly rectify it. The training of police students and the issue of employment after graduation should be planned and handled by the Civil Affairs Department. (3) Suggest that the Central Government consult the National Government to promulgate the New Salt Law within this year (submitted by representatives from Qidong, etc.). It was resolved to pass it. (3) Suggest that the Central Government build the southernmost section of the coastline as soon as possible to facilitate transportation and enrich people's livelihood (submitted by representatives from Qidong, etc.). It was resolved that the Provincial Executive Committee should request the Ministry of Railways to complete the construction before the 21st year. (4) Consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allocate funds to dredge Chishan Lake to benefit farmland and avoid drought and flood (submitted by representatives from Jurong, etc.). It was resolved to send a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the Department of Construction to send personnel to conduct on-site surveys, draft a dredging plan, and start construction within the year. The required funds should be used from the water conservancy funds collected from the three counties of Jiang, Ju, and Li. (5) The internal river navigation rights of the China Merchants Bureau in this province should be taken over and managed by this province, and it should be determined that all income from this case should be used for the development of agriculture and hydropower in various counties (submitted by representatives from Jiangyin, etc.). It was resolved to retain it. (6) Rickshaws in each county should be taken over by the local government to increase local revenue and relieve the suffering of rickshaw pullers (submitted by representatives from Wujin, etc.). It was resolved to withdraw this case. (7) The provincial and county road construction in this province should be paid for and exempted from taxes at any time when using civilian land (submitted by representatives from Jiangyin, etc.). It was resolved to pass it. (8) The Department of Construction cannot be responsible for the repair and management of the Jiangbei Canal, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. Now, six articles of follow-up measures are proposed for public decision to avoid another disaster (submitted by Gu Tingcong from Xinghua, etc.). It was resolved to pass it. Measures: 1. The canal project should be managed by an independent agency for flexible command. Its name may be restored to the old system or changed to the Jiangbei Canal Water Conservancy Bureau. 2. The position of the director should be raised, and a person familiar with river affairs should be appointed by the Central Government. 3. The relevant counties may elect representatives to form a council and a supervisory committee to participate in the design. 4. The mu tax for governance and operation paid by the 25 counties should be stored in a special account and not be used without the consent of the council. 5. The counties in the east of the canal are the tail end of the Huai River. Before there is a practical solution to guide the Huai River, in order to maintain the lives and property of tens of millions of people in the downstream dozens of counties, the provincial government should request the central government to allocate 5 million yuan for the governance of the canal and ports. 6. After this case is passed, consult the provincial government to be responsible for implementation within two months. (9) Please ask the Central Government to formulate a concrete plan for equalizing land rights, implement it within a time limit to stabilize society, and stabilize the political foundation (submitted by representatives from Wuxi, etc.). It was resolved to pass it. (10) Reduce the burden on students and set up free and scholarship quotas (submitted by representatives from Zhenjiang, etc.). It was resolved to pass it. Measures: 1. Reduce tuition fees and do not collect improper fees under various pretexts. 2. All levels of schools should set up more free and scholarship quotas. 3. Raise a fund for poor education to subsidize outstanding children from poor families to go to school. 4. Establish a method for selecting outstanding children from poor families. 5. Children of current primary and secondary school teachers should be exempt from tuition fees. (11) Please order the party departments of each county that anyone who has hosted anti-Japanese meetings in the past, has had fraudulent circumstances, or has not handled matters well and has not settled accounts</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>to be uniformly prohibited from participating in this anti-Japanese meeting (submitted by representatives from Shanghai, etc.). It was resolved to pass it.

<h3 id="e80">Urgent News from Wuhu <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wuhu is suffering from a major flood, and the embankments have been successively breached and exhausted. The only remaining one is the Wanchun embankment. Unexpectedly, at 10 p.m. last night, several feet of the gate of the embankment suddenly collapsed, causing another risk. However, when the risk occurred, gunshots were suddenly heard at the scene, which may have been caused by bandits. County Magistrate Yu has led a team to investigate.</p>
<p>▲ The Shanghai Bank of China entrusted the Wuhu branch to investigate the disaster situation in Wuhu. The general situation found has been replied by letter yesterday. The main points are that Wuhu has a total of more than 500,000 mu of embanked fields, and now only the Wanchun Township Special Zone has less than 60,000 mu of embanked fields. There are about 240,000 disaster victims in the township area and 100,000 in the urban area. There are even more refugees fleeing to Wuhu from nearby areas. The current emergency relief, that is, food and housing, is not enough without 300,000 yuan. The future construction relief is about 600,000 to 1 million yuan. The disaster in Dangtu, Fanchang and other counties is also serious.</p>
<p>▲ Since the establishment of the Flood Relief Association, only a few thousand yuan of relief funds and more than 300 stones of relief rice have been raised and distributed for emergency relief. The emergency relief groups run by other merchants distributed more than 100,000 steamed buns and buns. Now, it has become a situation that is not enough to meet the urgent needs. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Anhui Provincial Government, because the Central Relief Committee has agreed to allocate 170,000 yuan for relief. It is expected that it has been received. Please allocate a few 10,000 yuan first to save people's lives, and then raise funds for construction relief.</p>
<p>▲ Qingshuihe Town, 20 miles away from Wuhu, suddenly had a group of bandits yesterday. Seeing that the whole town was in the flood, all the shops were closed. They planned to abandon it and go elsewhere. There happened to be a Jingxian cargo ship passing through the area, and the bandits opened fire to stop it, boarded the ship to search for plunder. In addition to kidnapping one person, they also shot and injured four shipowners and passengers, including Mei Ronglin, who were sent to Shouzhi Hospital in Wuhu for treatment.</p>
<p>▲ The Wuhu Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association plans to order all merchants to pay 10% of the registration fee for Japanese goods due to lack of funds. However, those imported after August 10 will be confiscated and destroyed. If it can be implemented, the income will be huge. The merchants have been holding meetings in recent days, and they all said that they would rather close down than admit it. The association also notified the public ticket bureau to not sell tickets for Nisshin Company ships, and ordered the help gangs not to load and unload goods for Japanese ships.</p>
<p>▲ The Wuhu telephone line is rotten and has been broken many times. It is mixed with the electric light line, causing trouble and injury. The County Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Communications to transform it. Recently, the telegraph bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Communications, ordering it to borrow 30,000 yuan from the business community for thorough repair. However, the business community feels it is difficult to raise funds at this time when the flood is so heavy and business is stagnant. (19th)</p>

<p>Summary of the Urban Sanitation Meeting: The Urban Sanitation Movement Committee is an organization of party and government agencies.

Unexpectedly, this year, a part of the school land was connected to the Finance Bureau's Tax Collection Office for conversion of grain. Unexpectedly, the Tax Collection Office realized that the land was inconsistent, so they told Gao Zishan, the director of the Education Bureau, to conduct a detailed review at the rent collection office, and found out the facts. Not only was the land inconsistent, but also a lot of embezzlement was found in the accounts, so they asked the county to thoroughly investigate and sent the accountant to the county for detention. Now the Education Bureau has hired Pan Xulun, a certified public accountant from Shanghai Lixin, to Chang to liquidate. It is estimated that Hua Zhaozeng's account embezzlement totaled more than 16,000 yuan from the autumn of the 17th year to the spring of the 20th year in two and a half years.

<p>▲Explaining Relief for Disputes over Buddhist Educational Property</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Guizhou Education Bureau stating that Buddhist associations in various counties outside the province have been established one after another, intending to dispute educational property, and submitting the association's charter for review, requested methods for relief. The Ministry of Education issued an order stating, "The submitted documents are all noted. Temples should comply with the regulations for supervising temples, promoting religious teachings, and, according to their financial situation, engaging in public welfare or charitable undertakings. They must not use associations to seize property or obstruct educational funds. As for temple properties that have been allocated to educational expenses, since the decision was made earlier, they should be permanently used for educational expenses. If the Buddhist association in the province has any of the above-mentioned situations in the future, the bureau should follow the Ministry's order and the local educational expense guarantee measures to handle them according to the facts. Please comply."</p>

<p>▲Ministry of Education Orders Yuwen College to Stop Enrolling Specialized Students</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education had previously instructed the education bureaus of various provinces and cities, saying, "Managing universities should focus on enriching content and improving standards as the top priority. However, recently, private universities and colleges often randomly establish specialized, crash courses, etc., in order to attract students, which is prone to creating abuses. Starting from this year, all schools should stop enrolling students in the aforementioned attached departments and courses to prevent abuses. If, in reality, there is a need, specialized courses may be attached in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 5 of the University Regulations, etc., but must first be approved by the Ministry before enrollment is allowed. All bureaus are ordered to instruct all universities and colleges that have been registered and whose boards of directors have been registered to comply." Recently, the Ministry of Education saw reports that the private Yuwen College in Beiping yesterday recruited students for specialized and specialized courses, which contradicts the aforementioned Ministry order. The academy specially telegraphed the Beiping Education Bureau to instruct Yuwen College to stop recruiting students for the courses. The original telegram said, "The Beiping Education Bureau has seen reports that Yuwen College in Beiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Liaoning is recruiting new students for specialized and specialized courses. Please comply with the Ministry's Instruction No. 1277 and instruct the college to stop recruiting students for specialized and specialized courses, immediately withdraw the advertisement, and report for record."</p>

<h3 id="e108">This Year’s Vocational Facilities Plan for Shanghai Municipal Middle Schools (Continued) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Now, let’s discuss the plans for adding vocational groups to the three municipal middle schools in this city. The first is the Shanghai Municipal Xinlu Normal High School, Normal Department's plan to add an agricultural affairs group and a crafts group. The purpose of the agricultural affairs group is truly: 1. To cultivate rural teachers who can work in the fields, possess agricultural knowledge, and adapt to the rural environment; 2. To cultivate teachers who can engage in practical work and develop labor skills; 3. To cultivate craft talents with specialized training; 4. To cultivate work subject teachers to meet the practical needs of elementary school teaching. As for the curriculum, we have formulated it based on the Ministry of Education's provisional standards for normal school courses and with reference to rural education books. Roughly, the subjects related to the agricultural affairs group include: 1. Agriculture and Practice; 2. Rural Sociology and Practice; 3. Animal Husbandry; 4. Farm Facility Management; 5. Rural Education. In addition to the subjects stipulated by the Ministry of Education, the courses for the crafts group include: 1. Rural Education; 2. Specialty Crafts; 3. Paper Crafts; 4. Bamboo Crafts; 5. Woodworking; 6. Earthwork; 7. Metalwork; 8. Factory Practice. Now, regarding equipment, the school originally had sixty to seventy mu of land, but most of it is mulberry tree gardens. Therefore, in the first year, it is necessary to open up agricultural fields and add the necessary equipment for agricultural affairs and art. At the same time, it is also necessary to build a crafts classroom, and physics and chemistry classrooms, each with a room for handcraft materials, equipment, and instruments and medicines, as well as all the necessary woodworking equipment, at an estimated cost of over seven thousand yuan. As for the equipment for metalwork, it will be added gradually, starting in the second and third years.</p>
<p>The second middle school with vocational facilities is the Municipal Jingye Middle School, which will add a surveying and mapping group to the engineering department. Because Shanghai is a commercial and industrial society, the social need is primarily to cultivate commercial and industrial talents. In the future, graduates of the engineering surveying and mapping group can work as assistants to engineers and managers in engineering. If they want to further their studies, they can also prepare for entering science and engineering departments of universities. As for the curriculum of the engineering surveying and mapping group, in addition to revising it according to the Ministry of Education's high school curriculum standards, subjects related to engineering surveying and mapping will be added, including: 1. Projection Drawing; 2. Architectural Drawing; 3. Perspective Drawing; 4. Materials Science; 5. Building Construction; 6. Architectural Decoration; as well as Surveying Practice. Speaking of equipment, because of financial considerations, we will only select the most needed aspects of surveying and mapping and add them in stages. It is estimated that the first year will require adding: (1) a library classroom dedicated to surveying and mapping practice; (2) forty surveying and mapping drawing boards; (3) drawing tables; (4) four leather tape measures; (5) four 100-meter steel rulers, costing approximately over three thousand yuan. The second year will require continuing to add: (1) ten chains; (2) forty surveying poles; (3) eighty iron pegs; (4) two compasses; (5) four levels; (6) four standard leveling rods; (7) two theodolites, costing approximately six thousand yuan. The third year will require continuing to add two theodolites and two plane table surveying sets, costing approximately four thousand yuan. In the future, it will also be necessary to hire two specialized surveying and mapping teachers to ensure the achievement of professional training. The third vocational facility in a middle school is the addition of a home economics group to the normal department of the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School. Its purpose is roughly four points: First, to enhance girls' inherent interest and knowledge in home economics; Second, to practice girls' applicable home management skills; Third, to cultivate diligent home economics talents according to the Ministry of Education's plan; Fourth, to research applicable home economics teaching materials and teaching methods for elementary school labor subjects, and to cultivate home economics teachers. As for the curriculum of the home economics group, in addition to the subjects stipulated by the Ministry of Education, there are also required elective subjects for the home economics group, including: 1. Clothing Cutting and Practice; 2. Food Component Chemistry; 3. Food Cooking; 4. Child Care; 5. Embroidery; 6. Home Decoration; 7. Home Hygiene; 8. Home Economics; 9. Household Management; 10. Home Bookkeeping; 11. Home Chemical Crafts; 12. Home Gardening. As for equipment, the first year requires adding: (1) a home chemical crafts practice room; (2) a medical practice room; (3) an embroidery and sewing practice room; (4) four sewing machines; (5) children's toys and children's sports equipment, estimated to cost over one thousand three hundred yuan. The second year requires continuing to add: (1) a Chinese cooking practice room; (2) a Western cooking practice room; (3) kitchen and dining utensils; (4) banquet utensils; (5) continuing to add two sewing machines, estimated to cost one thousand three hundred and fifty yuan. The third year should add: 1. bedroom utensils, 2. living room utensils, 3. various house decoration utensils, 4. family medicines, 5. food storage utensils, 6. various utensils suitable for children's clothing, food, and housing, 7. child care utensils, 8. a home arrangement practice room, 9. a home chemical crafts practice room, 10. a washing and dyeing practice room, estimated to cost over one thousand seven hundred yuan. The hope for the home economics group is to organize the inherent home economics skills of our country using scientific methods, so that the general public can practically apply them in the future. Finally, what remains to be said is that regarding the Shanghai Education Bureau's promotion of productive education, everyone knows that Shanghai is a major commercial port in East Asia, on which the attention of China and foreign countries is focused. Any action in the administrative aspect is sufficient to influence the whole country. At present, in order to carry out the promotion of productive education, this bureau has spent the efforts of many experts, spent a lot of money and time, and is working towards that aspect with twelve points of sincerity. I think there must be many experts in the country willing to assist and cooperate, and think together, in order to achieve it as soon as possible. However, due to talent and time constraints, this bureau will inevitably have many errors in the future, and it is hoped that everyone will give their utmost guidance (End).</p>

They decided to establish a fundraising committee urgently while immediately allocating available relief funds, prioritizing severely affected areas in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu with 10,000 yuan each, selecting the most in need for distribution. However, the relief funds were limited. Fortunately, Chinese directors present raised 22,000 yuan on the spot, specifically for rescuing Hankou residents struggling in the flood.</p>

<p>The Hankou flood is exceptionally severe, and flood victims are in urgent need of rescue. The Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Compatriot Association in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Siming Public Hall held a meeting yesterday at the Ningbo Compatriot Association to address this matter. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yongni, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, Sun Meitang, Xiang Songmao, Wu Zhihao, Ge Yuchen, and over forty others.

<p>The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Public Welfare Association convened a temporary board meeting on the 19th, attended by over ten people, chaired by Hu Jinzhang. After performing the required formalities, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that recent reports of flood conditions in various provinces were extremely serious, unprecedented in a century. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi were almost entirely flooded, with the disaster area extending across sixteen provinces. Not only was the harvest hopeless, but flood victims were displaced, and their suffering and imminent death were appalling. If relief efforts were not initiated immediately, millions of disaster victims would be drowned by the flood. The association's organization was premised on public welfare, so it was important to determine whether to appoint a committee to solicit donations for disaster relief. After discussion, it was resolved to actively conduct fundraising for disaster relief. The association appointed Wang Houchang, Weng Kangfu, Shen Tianjue, Qiu Bonian, Wang Xuanche, Zhu Yu, Hong Xiamin, Cao Pinfang, and Hu Jinzhang as a nine-member fundraising committee, authorized to begin in three groups on the 22nd to solicit donations from all staff members in the industry. It also printed pictorial and textual promotional materials and donation receipts. All collected donations were to be given to the Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association and forwarded to the disaster areas for distribution. All printing, transportation, and meal expenses were to be borne by the association. A declaration was issued in advance to enable all sectors to jointly participate in this charitable act. A detailed account of expenses was prepared afterward and distributed to donors to demonstrate accountability.</p>

<h3 id="e122">British-Owned Public Bus Strike Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Caused by Opposition to Employer's Dismissal of Workers</p>
<p>▲ Presented Nine Conditions for Improved Treatment</p>
<p>All 222 conductors of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company opposed the employer's dismissal of workers and demanded improved treatment. They went on strike yesterday morning, causing all bus routes to be completely suspended. To maintain transportation, the company assigned ticket inspectors to perform conductor duties and勉强[miǎn qiǎng] managed to operate routes 1, 2, and 9. As of last night, the matter remained unresolved. The authorities sent personnel to investigate. The various circumstances are detailed below.</p>
<p>▲ All Routes Suspended At 6:00 AM yesterday, the public buses of the Public Concession on Route 1 (Jing'an Temple to Park Shooting Range), Route 2 (Er Yangjing Bridge to Park Shooting Range), Route 3 (Zhoujiaqiao to Caojiadu), Route 5 (San Mao Ge Bridge to North Station), Route 6 (Tilanqiao to Park Shooting Range), Route 7 (Nanyang University to Caojiadu), Route 8 (Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao), Route 9 (Jing'an Temple to Power Plant), and Route 10 (Caojiadu to Yinxiang Township), totaling 180 buses, were forced to suspend operations completely due to the conductor strike.</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for Strike At the end of July, the company summoned some representatives from last year's work stoppage for discussions and dismissed two Western employees, Pia and others, who had regularly oppressed workers. The workers were pleased upon hearing this. However, on the 10th of this month, the company dismissed ten conductors, citing embezzlement as the reason. The workers considered the dismissals unjustified and demanded reinstatement, but their request was denied. On the 18th, the company continued to dismiss six more conductors. All conductors were angered and, starting on the 19th, forty-four conductors did not report to work, implementing a slowdown. At 6:00 AM yesterday, all conductors went on strike to prompt the employer's awareness.</p>
<p>▲ Conditions Presented After the strike, the conductors convened a general meeting at 8:00 AM to discuss solutions. It was reportedly resolved in the meeting to (1) organize the Shanghai British-Owned Public Bus Workers Strike Committee; (2) elect twenty-one representatives to formally present the conditions to the company, totaling nine; (3) vow not to resume work until the objectives are achieved. The conditions are recorded below: (1) Drivers, ticket sellers, coppersmiths, laborers, bus cleaners, ticket writers, and ticket inspectors, regardless of seniority, shall receive a 30% wage increase, plus a housing allowance of 5 yuan and a rice allowance of 5 yuan. (2) Daily working hours shall not exceed eight hours, with four days of rest per month. Wages shall be paid as usual, and employees who have worked for one month shall receive four days of increased pay. (3) Wages shall be paid as usual during all holiday shutdowns, and those who work shall receive double pay. (4) Workers shall have the freedom to choose their own doctors, and medical expenses shall be borne by the company. Sick leave wages shall be paid as usual. (5) Workers shall have the freedom to organize clubs. The company shall subsidize 500 yuan per month for operating expenses and construct clubhouses. (6) Reinstate the workers dismissed after the 14th of this month and guarantee that no workers will be dismissed without just cause in the future. Dismissals must be approved by the club, and six months' severance pay must be provided after dismissal. (7) Skipping shifts shall not result in dismissal or wage deductions. (8) No red cards shall be issued. Sales amounts shall not be recorded in red ink. Tuition fees of 7.5 yuan and security deposits of 20 yuan shall be returned. (9) No workers who participated in this strike shall be dismissed, and wages shall be paid as usual during the strike period.</p>
<p>▲ Maintaining Transportation To maintain transportation, the company dispatched fourteen Route 1 buses from Jing'an Temple to Park Shooting Range and twenty Route 9 buses from Jing'an Temple to Power Plant at 8:40 AM, staffed by ticket inspectors as conductors. In the afternoon, six Route 2 buses from Er Yangjing Bridge to Park Shooting Range were also dispatched, also staffed by ticket inspectors as conductors.</p>
<p>▲ Authorities Investigate Ren Leping, the Sixth District Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, upon learning of the bus conductor strike, immediately dispatched inspectors to investigate and sent patrol officers to maintain order in the vicinity. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing the importance of transportation, sent Zhu Guilin to investigate the truth in detail for official handling.</p>
<p>▲ Refusal to Negotiate At 11:00 AM yesterday, the British-owned China General Omnibus Company convened a board meeting to discuss the conductor strike in detail. At 3:00 PM, the Public Bus Workers Strike Committee sent five representatives to the factory at 263 Connaught Road to present the nine conditions. However, the manager refused to receive them, and they were forced to withdraw. Upon hearing this, all workers were enraged and insisted on continuing the strike. It is reported that starting today, the drivers will also join the strike to provide assistance.</p>
<p>▲ Workers Express Views According to the Strike Committee yesterday, the company had only fifty buses when it first opened. Due to recent business growth, it has increased to 180 buses. Recently, it switched to diesel engines, doubling its profits. However, the conductors' treatment is quite harsh. Each person's monthly salary is only 20 yuan, with a maximum of 35 yuan. After various penalties, such as red cards (meaning conductors must get off the bus first and on the bus last at major stations, otherwise they are fined one yuan each time), the actual monthly wage is only 12 or 13 yuan, making it impossible to maintain a living. The company also arbitrarily dismisses workers and hires plainclothes ticket inspectors to monitor workers' actions. For example, conductor No. 259 was dismissed for embezzling four copper coins. In a matter of days, over ten people have been dismissed, so they were forced to take this action.</p>

<p>▲ Two Thousand Workers Rush Day and Night</p>
<p>The China National Roads Construction Association has been constructing the Road and Municipal Exhibition Hall on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. Construction has been progressing very rapidly. Approximately 2,000 workers are rushing day and night, so the majority of the construction has already been completed. The repair of all road surfaces, the erection of reed sheds, and the construction of floors are proceeding actively to ensure that the grand opening occurs on schedule on September 12th. All engineering is personally supervised by Mr. Tao Guilin, a renowned architect from this port, from the Tao Fook Kee company. In addition to the large number of workers busy with the work, the site is filled with bamboo, wood, reed mats, cinders, and other materials. The association will hold the exhibition for three weeks, from September 12th to October 2nd. The second week will be the Road and Municipal Conference, bringing together representatives from all provinces to discuss important issues related to road and municipal administration. According to Mr. Zheng Xitao, the executive director of the association, since construction began last Sunday, not only has the engineering progressed rapidly, but various Chinese and Western merchants have also eagerly participated, renting stalls to display their products. Recently, the Wisconsin Highway Trailer Company of the United States telegraphed to book display space, and its exhibits have already been shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon. In addition, companies such as the local Fada Motor Company, Qianxin Foreign Company, Jinshan Iron Factory, Wenyi Foreign Company, and Tongyuan Company have all signed large orders for display space to exhibit cars, freight vehicles, road construction materials, road construction machinery, and office supplies. Mr. Bowen, the Export Department Manager of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, is currently traveling around the world and has arrived in northern China. He has also telegraphed Shanghai, stating that he will arrive in port on the 26th and plans to attend in person, bringing sixty reels of American road construction films to be screened and to lecture on road construction issues.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Murder of a Yarn Factory Inspector <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲ Two Victims Died Unjustly</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, a Chanzhou native and inspector for the Yangshupu China First Knitting Factory, was ambushed yesterday morning in front of the Shenxin Ninth Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road. Numerous shots were fired, killing two people and injuring three others. The victim, Zhao Xilin, previously served as a detective in his hometown. It is reported that the ambush was due to past grievances. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Inspector Attacked Zhao Xilin, a native of Changzhou, is 32 years old. He has been working as an inspector at the China First Knitting Factory at 10 Longjiang Road for six or seven years. The Shenxin Ninth Yarn Factory at 89 Yangshupu Road opened this spring, and Zhao also joined that factory, concurrently serving as an inspector. Therefore, every morning when the two factories opened, Zhao would go to China First and then to Shenxin, as usual. At around 6:30 AM yesterday, Zhao was outside the Shenxin Ninth Factory after finishing his duties, talking with several fellow villagers on the road when suddenly seven or eight thugs wielding box cannons and iron rods approached. Upon seeing Zhao, they immediately opened fire, firing no fewer than one or two dozen shots. Zhao was unable to escape in time and was hit. His companions were also victims of collateral damage.</p>
<p>▲ Two Dead, Three Injured After the gunfire ceased, the thugs escaped during the confusion. It was found that a crab vendor had been fatally shot in the head by a stray bullet. Another victim, Li Litang, the owner of a nearby sesame cake shop, was shot in the temple and also died. Three people were injured and sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. They include Tao Ruisheng, a 30-year-old Changzhou native and worker at the Shenxin factory, who was shot in the buttocks; Xu Sihai, a 37-year-old Changzhou native and owner of the Yongxiangfeng Coffin Shop, who was injured in the right hand; and Xu Hexian, a worker at Shenxin, who was injured in the foot and is not in serious condition.</p>
<p>▲ Rooted in Grievances It is said that Zhao's shooting was due to past grievances. The Yangshupu police immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to apprehend the culprits. The two bodies were transported to the Pheron Road Mortuary for autopsy and will be reported to the court for inspection this morning. Zhao Xilin lived at 6 Anderli, Yangshupu Road, and had a wife and two concubines.</p>

<p>Mr. Jin Zongcheng of the Shanghai Bank advocates using funds from the Yulan Sheng Hui (Ghost Festival) to aid disaster victims. He sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating: "Respected Editor, the current floods in various provinces of our country are causing severe devastation. Every time I read the newspapers, the scenes are so tragic that I cannot bear to finish reading. 'Relieving disasters and helping neighbors' is an ancient and clear teaching. Everyone has a sense of compassion. Although there are now various disaster relief associations raising donations, the disaster area is so vast that the more donations, the better. Being able to get just one more gold coin means saving one more life. Shanghai, during this seventh month of the lunar calendar, usually holds the Taiping Gong Jiao Yulan Sheng Hui. In my humble opinion, rather than relieving wandering souls, which involves superstition, it is better to prioritize the urgent and save the dying in the disaster areas. This merit is even greater than building a seven-story pagoda."</p>

<h3 id="e132">Tragic Accident of German Ship Colliding with Dredging Boat <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Negotiating Compensation Issues</p>
<p>After the Hai Long dredging boat of the Dredging Bureau was sunk by the German ship "Kaibaierenshi" in the Chenjiazhui section of the Huangpu River on Tuesday morning, the Tokyo Salvage Company and Ruirong have sent people underwater to investigate whether it can be salvaged, in order to report to the chief engineer of the bureau for a decision. The boat is currently sunk at the bottom of the river, 30 feet deep, right in the navigation channel, posing a danger to large ships entering and exiting. As for the bodies of the three drowned crew members, two were found on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, and the other was found in the evening. The night watchman Zhou Ansheng, who was on the deck at the time, saw the perilous situation and jumped down, desperately shouting for help, hoping to alert the entire crew to escape. Unexpectedly, he lost his footing and fell into the steam cylinder, where he was scalded to death by boiling water. The Dredging Bureau originally planned to ask the local security guard Qin Bingqing to report Zhou Ansheng's body to the Wusong Seventh District First Precinct, and then request the local court for an autopsy. However, due to an order from the River and Lake Department, to facilitate negotiations with the German ship for compensation, the body was sent to the Feilun Road autopsy center to await examination by the First Special District Court. Therefore, it was not until yesterday morning that the autopsy was completed and the burial arranged. Zhou Ansheng's family went to the Dredging Bureau yesterday morning to meet with the chief engineer, arguing that Ansheng did not die in the water but was scalded to death after falling into the steam cylinder while trying to save the lives of the entire crew, which was a truly tragic and unbearable sight. Moreover, Ansheng left behind a meager estate and many dependents, so they requested generous compensation and requested for a coffin and clothing. The engineer of the bureau replied that according to the regulations of the bureau, only two years' salary would be given to the bereaved family in case of death in the line of duty. However, in this case, Ansheng died after being scalded due to panic after falling into the steam cylinder while trying to save the lives of the entire crew, so the tragic situation was understandable. Whether or not an exception should be made for generous compensation would have to be decided by a bureau meeting. Thereupon, Ansheng's wife and children thanked him tearfully and withdrew.</p>

<p>▲ Because a Worker Refused to Pay for Damages</p>
<p>The Route 1 Changlu tram of the China Tram Company left Xiaodongmen for Gaochangmiao at 6:45 yesterday morning. More than ten workers from a certain place were getting on the tram at Xiaodongmen Station. One of them accidentally broke a piece of the tram window glass while boarding. The conductor asked him to pay for the damage, but the worker refused, leading to a conflict. Later, a police officer was called, and they went to the First District General Office together. After questioning and judging by the director, the worker was ordered to pay four jiao of foreign currency to settle the case. Unexpectedly, the worker was not satisfied and gathered a group of people to wait at Xuejiabang. When the tram passed by, they made things difficult for the conductor No. 98, dragged him off the tram, and beat him up, injuring his back and waist. Later, the ticket inspector caught a glimpse of the scene and sent conductor No. 98 to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. He also notified the police, who arrested the assailant and three accomplices and took them to the First District First Precinct for interrogation. At that time, tram traffic in the area was suspended for forty minutes.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Continued Trial of the Dancer Dung-Throwing Case <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲ Ge Chongxi Denies Instigation</p>
<p>▲ Sun Ai'ying's Arm Develops Blisters</p>
<p>Sun Ai'ying, a dancer from Shanghai Dance Hall and a native of Nanjing, was riding in a rickshaw at 10:10 p.m. on the 12th of this month, passing through the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Mahuo Road, when Zhou Fugen, Qiu Genfa, and Ye Zixiang suddenly stopped her and poured dung on her head. Sun called the police, who arrested Zhou and the other two and handed them over to the First Special Court for interrogation. They confessed that Ge Chongxi of the Paris Dance Hall was suspected of instigating the attack. The court ordered a postponement to summon Ge to court for further questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Gongliang held a continued trial. Ge Chongxi and his legal representative Jiang Baoli attended the court to await questioning. Sun Ai'ying also hired lawyer Zhang Zirang to represent her. First, Lawyer Zhang stated that because the plaintiff was insulted by the three defendants, blisters had developed on her arm, which had now grown large. Moreover, at the time, an embroidered scarf and a jade brooch were robbed, so the plaintiff accused the three defendants of the crimes of insult, injury, and robbery. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, rose and stated that the case had already been publicly prosecuted by the police. If the plaintiff wanted to file another lawsuit, she would have to file a private prosecution and could not include it in this case. Ge Chongxi had already been summoned to court today, but the police had not filed a lawsuit. Whether or not to file a lawsuit in the future was still under consideration. However, the case was being tried by Cheng Shangfeng. Should the trial be updated today? He requested a ruling. Judge Jiang then instructed that the trial be updated. Sun Ai'ying then recounted the situation at that time. Judge Jiang then questioned the three defendants who instigated them. They replied that Zhou Degong instigated them. He asked if Ge Chongxi instigated them. They replied no. Judge Jiang then instructed Sun Ai'ying to go to the forensic doctor to examine the wounds on her arm. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zhang, also stated that since the police did not prosecute Ge Chongxi, the plaintiff should file a private prosecution separately. Lawyer Jiang Baoli also stated that when the plaintiff was questioned in court last time, she accused Ge Chongxi of molestation, which damaged Ge's reputation, so he must also file a counterclaim, etc. Judge Jiang then summoned Ge to stand in the witness box. Ge said that the plaintiff's contract with him had not expired when she joined Dahai. Because she was a woman, he did not deal with her. Now, this happened suddenly, and she falsely accused him of instigation, which he did not understand. Judge Jiang said that further investigation of the case was still necessary, so he ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

Later, he had disagreements with his colleagues, which led to his downfall. Moreover, he was fond of gambling. After the actor lost his job, he lived off his wife's savings, which resulted in economic difficulties. At first, he pawned his wife's belongings. For the past three years, his wife has returned to her mother's home, currently residing in her mother Chen's residence in Zhizhong Lane, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession. Sha has been gone for more than a year without returning. After searching everywhere, there is no trace of him.

<h3 id="e146">Investigation of the Maid's Private Escape <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲ Buying a Maid is Also a Crime</p>
<p>Zhang Tang, a local woman residing in a bungalow in Baijiazai, Gelan Road, purchased Cui Zhen, the eight-year-old daughter of Mao Panxing from Tongzhou, for 68 foreign dollars through Yang Qiqiao on April 3 of this year. However, at around 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Tang instructed Cui Zhen to go out and fetch water, but she did not return. Later, it was learned that Cui Zhen had been taken back and hidden by her father, Mao Panxing. The Yangshupu Police Station was notified, and Chinese detective Pan Yulin was sent to arrest Mao Panxing, Yang Qiqiao, and Yang Qiqiao. However, Cui Zhen's whereabouts were still unknown. They were taken to the police station, and a copy of Cui Zhen's sales contract was found at Zhang Tang's home, stating that Cui Zhen was a maid. The police chief believed that she was also committing a crime by buying another person's daughter to enslave her. He ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police lawyer Li Zhishan's statement of the case, Cui Zhen's brother Lin Gen, 13 years old, testified that because his family was poor, his father received 68 foreign dollars and sold Cui Zhen to Zhang Tang as a daughter. He did not know anything else. Zhang Tang testified that Yang Qiqiao was the intermediary and purchased Cui Zhen as an adopted daughter, not as a servant, and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. The defendant, Mao Panxing, was conspiring with Yang Qiqiao to release the pigeons (deceive her), and her lawyer wanted to file a complaint, requesting that they be released on bail to await interrogation. Mao Panxing testified that he did not admit to hiding his daughter, and Yang Qiqiao testified that he was indeed the intermediary when Cui Zhen was sold to Zhang Tang as a daughter. This was a mutual agreement, so he did not receive any brokerage fees. He asked for consideration. After Judge Shen Bingle examined the testimony, he ordered Mao and Yang to be returned to custody, and Zhang Tang was allowed to post a substantial shop guarantee. The case was adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Died from Her Injuries</p>
<p>Jiang Er'nan, the nine-year-old daughter of Jiang Bao, a woman residing at No. 96 De'an Lane, North Shanxi Road, Wuxi, was standing in the doorway to cool off at around 10 p.m. the day before yesterday. Zhang A'xiao, a girl living in the same residence, went out to fetch water and returned home. When she reached the door, she asked Jiang to move aside, but Jiang refused. She then pushed Jiang. At that time, Hu Chuanbing, a 13-year-old boy from No. 78 in the same neighborhood, was also there and accidentally bumped into Hu. Hu then pushed Jiang, causing her head to hit the corner of the washboard, causing a severe injury. Jiang's mother took the girl to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but because the injury was critical, she soon died. The hospital notified the Huishan Police Station to send detectives to investigate. The girl's body was taken to the Feilun Road Autopsy Center. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Guo Huaipu arrived at the office for examination. According to Zhang A'xiao's testimony, she was carrying hot water and was afraid of scalding Jiang, so she pulled her away. Hu Chuanbing testified that Jiang stepped on his foot and hurt him, so he pushed her, but did not expect her to fall and be injured. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Guo ruled that the girl Jiang Er'nan died as a result of being pushed and injured by Hu Chuanbing, and ordered the mother to provide a coffin and clothing for the body.</p>

<h3 id="e150">The Maritime Surveying Bureau Will Take Over the Customs Surveying Affairs <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Waterway from Wusong to Jiangyin</p>
<p>▲ Warning Ships Still Issued by the Customs</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that the waterway survey from Wusong to Jiangyin has been handled by the Jianghai Customs. The Ministry of the Navy believes that since the Ministry of the Sea has established a Maritime Surveying Bureau, matters related to waterway surveying should be transferred to the Bureau. Previously, it had submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, earnestly requesting that the section of the waterway be transferred to the Maritime Surveying Bureau first. The Bureau received a training order from the Executive Yuan forwarded by the Navy yesterday, and will send personnel to take over. The Executive Yuan's training order is recorded below for compliance. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance stated that the Ministry of the Navy had requested that the surveying affairs of the section between Wusong and Jiangyin be transferred to the Navy Surveying Bureau and that warning ships be issued. It is approved that the Surveying Bureau is fully responsible for the surveying affairs of this section and can be assigned to handle it. However, regarding river and other engineering matters, the Customs should be allowed to accurately set up buoys and other objects in the section to maintain safety so that there will be no obstruction. If the Executive Yuan approves, please order the Ministry of Military Affairs to comply with the aforementioned method. The Ministry will instruct the relevant departments to remove their responsibilities for the surveying affairs of that section. As for the Ministry of the Navy's original request for the issuance of warning ships, the issuance of warning ships is uniformly issued by the Customs nationwide and is of great importance to navigation safety. It should be handled by a single agency to avoid disputes. The Ministry should reserve this section. The Ministry of the Navy's request to transfer the surveying affairs of the section between Wusong and Jiangyin to the Maritime Surveying Bureau is hereby submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions for implementation. Therefore, it is reported that the Ministry has repeatedly submitted requests to the Executive Yuan for review and handling. In addition to instructing that the report be acknowledged, it is stated that the request to transfer the surveying affairs of the section between Wusong and Jiangyin to the Maritime Surveying Bureau is the same as the request of the Ministry of the Navy. Please order the Ministry to instruct the relevant departments to take over. In the future, regarding changes in rivers and other matters, the Bureau must immediately notify the Maritime Patrol Engineering Department of the surveying situation and news so that buoys and other objects can be moved. Also, the warning signs should still be uniformly issued by the Customs nationwide to avoid disputes, as this is to maintain navigation safety. It should be approved and ordered to the Ministry of the Navy to comply. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Yangtze River Shipping Increases Prices Due to Flooding <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲ Refusing to Load Goods Except for Grain and Essential Supplies</p>
<p>▲ Uniform 10% Surcharge Above Jiujiang</p>
<p>The Yangtze River region has been hit by flooding, with Wuhan being the most severely affected, followed by Jiujiang and Chongqing. The flooding has persisted for a month without receding and is continuing to rise. Shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Wuhan yesterday, stating that the water level had risen several more inches, reaching a depth of 57 feet at its deepest point. The Jardine Matheson Wharf has also risen to 55 feet and 3 inches, making it difficult for ships to load cargo onto the docks. Dockworkers above Jiujiang have successively raised their wages, placing a heavy burden on the shipping companies. Therefore, six companies in Shanghai—China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Sanpei, Ningshao, and Nisshin—held a meeting at Jardine Matheson yesterday afternoon. They decided that, starting immediately, they would refuse to load cargo destined for Wuhan except for grain and essential supplies, as well as cargo that passengers cannot pick up themselves at the ship, to avoid stockpiling in the warehouses. It was also decided that, starting on Monday, the 24th, they would uniformly add a 10% surcharge to the original freight rates for shipments from Shanghai to Jiujiang and Hankou, as well as from Hankou to Yuezhou, Changsha, and Xiangtan, to compensate for the losses. This decision has been communicated to the customs brokers.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Labor Dispute on the Taizhou Steamer <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ Conflict Between Waiters and Purser</p>
<p>Zhou Yixiu, a waiter on the Taizhou Steamer of the Wenzhou-Taizhou Line Taizhou Company, began working on the ship in 1928. According to company regulations, he was required to pay a deposit of 200 silver dollars. Zhou, being unable to pay the full amount at once, paid 100 silver dollars in July of that year, and another 100 silver dollars the following year. Both payments were handled by the purser, Chi Zhushu. However, the purser neglected to forward the payments to the company. Last month, during a company investigation of deposits, it was discovered that Zhou Yixiu had been working for a long time without paying the deposit, and his name was not on file with the company. As a result, he was dismissed. After learning of this, the waiter went to the company to explain that he had already paid the deposit to the purser. The purser was questioned by the company and, on the return trip from Taizhou to Shanghai, returned 200 silver dollars to Zhou on the 19th, ordering him to leave the ship upon arrival in Shanghai. Zhou protested and was beaten and had a shirt torn. Also, last Saturday, when the ship was sailing from Shanghai to Haimen, a box of woolen cloth (containing 40 bolts) was loaded in the main cargo hold. On Monday morning, after arriving in Haimen, it was discovered that 36 bolts of woolen cloth, valued at 656 silver dollars, were missing. The company was notified upon the return to Shanghai, and the shareholders decided that the purser, the accountant, the cargo handler, and the six watchmen would be held responsible for the loss. The purser told the waiters that if they were unwilling to compensate for the loss, they would be suspended from work. The waiters argued that, according to regulations, the watchmen were responsible for missing cargo on the deck, but they were not responsible for cargo lost within the hold. They felt oppressed by the purser and reported the matter to the Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Union yesterday, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Wang Yansong Resigns from Anti-Japanese Association <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member and Director of the Custody Section of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee, sent a letter to the City Party Headquarters and the Anti-Japanese Association yesterday, resigning from all positions held concurrently in the association. The original letter reads: "Respected Sirs, since the Japanese government instigated Korean nationals to persecute Chinese, causing a tragic incident, righteous indignation has swelled up across the country, and a struggle has been launched. Representatives from all sectors of this city convened a meeting and resolved to organize the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee, using the method of permanent economic severance with Japan as a tool to wage a life-or-death battle against Japanese imperialism. I, Yansong, was erroneously elected as a committee member and was further elected to the Standing Committee, responsible for custody. In terms of ability, I am certainly insufficient to undertake such an important task. In terms of public justice, I dare not simply abandon my duty. I have tried my best, exerting my limited abilities and striving to follow the cause. Moreover, because the military campaign to suppress bandits is currently in progress, there is no shortage of people taking advantage of the situation. How can we demonstrate a spirit of unity against external enemies? How can we avoid providing ammunition for our enemies to use? I have racked my brains, earnestly concerned and actively working. My humble private feelings cannot be expressed in words. Considering that I am physically weak and the task is arduous, I dare not shirk the toil of serving against external enemies, even if I fail. However, if in addition to external work, I am forced to cope with difficult environments and to navigate avoidable disputes, it will only waste my energy and contribute nothing. I am deeply pained and unable to cope. Therefore, I have no choice but to resign from the positions of committee member and Standing Committee Member and Director of the Custody Section of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee. As for the anti-Japanese movement, as long as I have breath, my determination will not waver. As a citizen, a party member, and a merchant, I have responsibilities to fulfill and will certainly make the necessary efforts. I will not be negligent simply because I have resigned as a committee member. I am sending this special letter to respectfully inform you and humbly request your review and approval. This is my earnest prayer."</p>

<p>▲ One Cent Per Word Regardless of Urgency</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Telecommunications issued an order to its branch offices yesterday, stating: "According to instructions from the Ministry of Communications, the charges for translation services at various telegraph offices vary, with some charging a percentage of the telegraph fee and others charging one cent per word. The methods are inconsistent. Furthermore, it is inappropriate to charge a percentage of the telegraph fee for the translation of urgent telegrams and telegrams requiring verification.

<p>On the south side of Taiyang Temple Road on Gonghe New Road in Zhabei, there is a vacant lot of approximately three mu, surrounded by about thirty shanties built from iron sheets. The residents, numbering no fewer than fifty households, are mostly laborers and pig farmers. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a fire broke out in the home of a Yang family from Yancheng due to careless cooking. The fire quickly spread to the pile of firewood, and flames raged out of control. Within half an hour, the thirty-odd shanties were reduced to ashes. Fire brigades from various sections of the city rushed to the scene and made strenuous efforts to prevent the fire from spreading to the Zhifu West Lane and Fude Bathhouse on the north side. These buildings sustained only minor damage, such as scorched windows and doors. Most of the residents were away at work when the fire broke out. By the time they returned, they had no homes to go to. Their cries of despair were pitiful. Fortunately, the fire occurred during the day and no one was injured. The Yang family, who started the fire, was arrested by the police from the Fourth District and taken for investigation. It is reported that about one hundred pigs, both large and small, were burned to death.</p>

<p>Huasha Town, Shaoxing, has always been a silk-producing area, with an annual output of 300,000 bolts. In recent years, due to sluggish sales abroad and frequent natural disasters and wars at home, weaving has suffered, and merchants have only focused on profits. As a result, business has declined drastically, and workers have lost their jobs. To remedy the situation, Hu Jitang and others invited silk merchants and weaving workshops to organize the Shanghai Silk Industry Cooperative, aiming to mutually research and improve products and conduct sales with integrity. The cooperative opened last month. Its distribution center is located at No. 1260 Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, Shanghai.

<h3 id="e174">News from Various Labor Unions <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Publishing Industry Union: The Shanghai Publishing Industry Union issued a public notice to the members of the Zhonghua Book Company yesterday, which was filled with resentment. Excerpts are as follows: "To all members of the Zhonghua Book Company, your General Manager Lu Feikui has repeatedly undermined your labor union. You have all experienced his tactics and will never forget them. Since you joined our union, Lu Feikui has been panicked and lost his composure. The leaflet he issued yesterday (August 12) was his final lament. We have told you in detail about the history, evolution, and status of the Publishing Industry Union when you joined the union, but we will briefly explain it again. Our union was reorganized and established according to the orders of the party and government on February 28 of this year. Before February 28, it was indeed called the Commercial Press Union, but it took several struggles to reach its present state. During the first strike in 1925, 80% of the workers at the Commercial Press earned less than 25 yuan. After seven years of long-term struggle, the average salary has now reached 47 yuan, which is enough to live a normal life. Comrades, humans can only survive through struggle. If the workers at the Commercial Press had not had the spirit of long-term struggle, their lives would certainly be as difficult as yours are today. On the day of our union's founding meeting, Mr. Zhu Jiahua, a member of the Central Committee, personally attended and gave guidance. He highly praised the spirit of our union and urged us to expand the number of members and to bring all unorganized publishing workers in the city into the union. Comrades, the status of our union is one of the best not only in Shanghai but also in China, and it deserves the attention of society. The reasons for our union's recruitment of members are two: (1) The apparent reason: After the promulgation of the Labor Union Law, according to Article 6 of the Labor Union Law, 'Only one labor union can be established for workers of the same occupation or industry in the same area.' The factory labor union can no longer exist. The Shanghai Publishing Industry Union was born in response to this situation. The workers of the Commercial Press have a history of seven years of organization, which is rare in the publishing industry. Of course, they were the first to join. Because the workers of other publishing houses had not joined at the time of our union's representative meeting on February 28, there was no way to elect them as directors or supervisors. After Lu Feikui sees February 28 next year, any member of our union from any company will have the right to elect and be elected. At that time, after the workers of the Zhonghua Book Company are elected as directors and supervisors, Lu Feikui should stop talking nonsense about '...luring others to join...' (2) The real reason: The capitalists of the publishing industry can unite with various publishers to form the Book Industry Trade Association. The workers of the publishing industry can unite and join the union, which is also a special right granted by law. The Publishing Industry Union should show a spirit of fearlessness and liberate the fellow workers who are being oppressed by the iron-fisted capitalists and let them live as 'human beings.' The purpose is very clear. This time, Lu Feikui, knowing that the strength of the Publishing Industry Union cannot be insulted and that it is not as easy to destroy as the Zhonghua Book Company Union, had to deceive the City Chamber of Commerce, the Book Industry Trade Association, and the Color Printing Industry Trade Association to act as shields, sending out a telegram and publishing advertisements. He exhausted all his tricks, but he could not pull out a single hair of the Publishing Industry Union. On the contrary, he aroused the anger of all labor unions in the city, who issued a joint declaration that they must eliminate this public enemy, Lu Feikui. The conditions for improving treatment that were passed at the founding meeting of the Zhonghua Book Company Office are mostly those that have been implemented in the industry for several years. Every article is legal and reasonable. Lu Feikui said that it was laughable, but hopefully he won't laugh and then cry. He said that Article 9, the profit-sharing method, is 'even more laughable,' which shows that he is an incorrigibly stubborn old man. The members of the labor union, which is based on the Three Principles of the People, all advocate for cooperation between labor and capital. On the one hand, they seek to improve the living conditions of workers, and on the other hand, they seek to increase productivity and make the shareholders not suffer losses from the increased profits. This profit-sharing system can not only reconcile the conflict between labor and capital, but also improve the productivity of employees. With a capital of 2 million yuan, the Zhonghua Book Company can easily make a profit of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan if the management is proper. Why should Lu Feikui be so alarmed? Comrades, if you do not want to live an inhuman life under Lu Feikui's constant oppression, then is there any other way out other than to strengthen your solidarity under the banner of the Publishing Industry Union? Comrades, our union leads more than 4,000 members, who are your direct backing. All the labor unions in the city, leading 800,000 workers, are your indirect backing. Your support is so strong. Comrades, move forward! The final victory will belong to you!"</p>
<p>▲ Postal Workers Union: On August 19, the Postal Workers Union held its 35th Executive Committee meeting, chaired by Xiao Qingshan. The reported items were omitted. Discussion items: (1) The new organizational law of the General Post Office is difficult to implement. How should it be remedied? Motion for a decision. Resolution: (A) It was decided to hold a joint meeting of the two unions at 2:00 PM this Saturday to thoroughly discuss the matter. (B) To handle the matter in accordance with the resolutions of the 29th meeting. (2) The Chengdu Postal Workers Union sent a telegram stating that the price of rice has risen to 60 yuan per picul and requesting the union to ask the authorities for rice subsidies. How should this be handled? Motion for discussion. Resolution: Submit the request to the General Labor Union for approval. The union will strongly support the request. (3) The 32nd branch submitted a request to be given a copy of the newspaper. Motion for discussion. Resolution: Reply by letter. (4) The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union sent a letter recommending Kang Yong, Ge Fei, Lao Jieming, and other seven people as members of the preparatory committee for the 2nd Sports Meet. Please set a date for the joint meeting to discuss all matters. Resolution: Zhu Xuefan, Zhang Kechang, and Qi Jiamou are responsible for handling the matter. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>▲ Shipwrights Union: The Shipwrights Union held its fourth joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Chen Xiangquan. (1) The outstanding issue of the labor-capital treatment contract dispute of the union has been submitted to the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan of the National Government for approval. It was recently learned that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice on the 5th of this month, ordering the capitalists of the Zhejiang and Guangdong shipwrights in the city to recommend representatives within ten days to jointly form a labor committee, otherwise it would be considered a voluntary abandonment. The deadline has passed. The union has submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting a decision and is awaiting instructions to proceed. Vote, passed. (2) The regulations for the organization of the Labor and Industry Committee were drafted by Chen Xiangquan and have been completed. They were handed over to Dong Ahua, Chen Binwu, Qiu Shen, Mai Qiu, and Ye Xianggao for review. After completion, the forms of the labor representatives who have been recommended will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. Resolution, adopted as is. (3) The All-City Labor Union Representative Assembly resolved to support anti-Japanese aid to overseas Chinese, and each labor union should donate money. How should the union handle this? Motion for a decision. Resolution, notify the workers of each factory branch to participate in the patriotic movement, boycott Japanese goods, and purchase domestic goods. The first and second branches will raise donations separately to help overseas Chinese in Korea. Vote, passed. The rest were omitted.</p>

<p>— Zhang Shanzi</p>
<p>My late teacher, Li Meian of Linchuan, also known as Qing Daoren, lived in seclusion by the sea after the 1911 Revolution, making a living by selling writings and calligraphy. His noble character and profound knowledge were universally respected and need no further elaboration. This year marks the 65th anniversary of his birth, and his former colleagues from the Li clan are celebrating by collecting and publishing his various poems and writings. They also plan to place advertisements in newspapers seeking contributions. I possess several exquisite letters from my late teacher that are unknown to the world. I am recording one here to demonstrate his noble spirit and integrity, which is evident in everything he did. His letter in response to the Weiliang Association states: To the esteemed gentlemen of the Weiliang Association, I, the poor Daoist, am a heartbroken man. During the national upheaval of 1911, I sought death but could not find it. I drifted to the sea and made a living by selling my writings. My impoverished household consists of nearly forty people, who depend on my brush for their sustenance. For six years, I have been in dire straits. I received a letter from your association, to which I have already responded. I recently received another letter stating that since I have not obtained access to the thoroughfare for ten thousand people, how can I prevent people from taking what they want? It also stated that I should prepare a remittance of three hundred dollars to HSBC to assist your association. This is a misunderstanding. I am a seller of writings, not someone who has a large sum of money stored in a chest. There are days when I earn a few dollars, and days when I don't earn a single dollar. This type of business does not thrive unless the market is peaceful. Only then do people think about such embellishments. It is not like a pheasant that can be caught everywhere. Recently, credit has been tight, and for more than ten days, I have not had a single dollar of income. I can barely take care of myself. How can I help your association? As the saying goes, "If you have money, money is your security; if you don't have money, your life is your security." Moreover, people who love life must have hope for the future. I have no wife, no concubines, no children. All my children are my brothers' children or the grandchildren of widows. My friend Wu Jianqiu said, "The Daoist has no wife or concubines to support, yet he has the burden of a family." Moreover, the world is changing daily, and treacherous and evil people are all in high positions, possessing heavy armies. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. I only seek a quick death and great liberation. I received two letters, so I sincerely inform you of this. Please conduct a thorough investigation. If there are any lies, I will willingly accept being led to a firing squad with guns and bombs, and I will have no regrets. Qing Daoren bows his head. This letter was written by his family member. The original manuscript was retained. My tenth brother, Junshou, purchased and treasured it at a high price. (Requital)</p>
<h3 id="e180">Discovery of Primitive Villages in Germany <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Shoulin</p>
<p>In primitive times, humans lived in caves or built nests in treetops, both in the East and West. Later, as culture gradually developed, they began to have houses and formed villages. However, their lives at that time were quite simple. Recently, German archaeologists discovered a village constructed by humans during the Stone Age in Lindenthal, near Cologne. This village was constructed over five thousand years ago. Its construction is completely identical to that of the Middle Ages. The village is surrounded by a moat, about seven feet deep and sixteen feet wide. Several feet away from the moat is a fence made of stacked firewood. Beneath the moat, many fragments of broken pottery were found. There are also dozens of well-preserved house foundations. However, the construction methods are chaotic and unsystematic, with no overall system. In terms of appearance, they are curved. The holes around the wooden fence prove that the houses were entirely constructed of wood. In some places, there are long, narrow cracks in the ground, perhaps used by the inhabitants to cool food. In addition, several rectangular open spaces were found, one of which was more than seventy feet long. There are many wooden pillars on top, but no household items, which shows that their lives at that time were simple. The most numerous items discovered this time are pottery. In addition, a large number of Stone Age human tools, such as hand grinders, flint knives, arrowheads, hand axes, and tools made of animal bones, were found. It is said that the archaeologists plan to transport all of these items to the Berlin Museum for display for the reference of the country's people.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Recording Two Tragic Cases <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>The conscription of laborers by the police is a cruel policy unique to military times. In particular, the implementation of this policy in rural areas has caused unrest. Often, not even the chickens and dogs are spared, reminiscent of the scenes in Du Fu's "The Officer at Stone Moat." Last month, I returned to my hometown on business. At that time, the war situation in Jiangxi was urgent, and there was a conscription of laborers in the countryside. About seven or eight miles from my home, in a place bordering Dantan, there was a tailor who was walking alone in the fields. He was forced by the police to run wildly across a bridge, but there were several police officers waiting to intercept him under the bridge. He stopped and pleaded, "If you must not spare me, then take me from the water." The police ignored him and surrounded him from both sides. In desperation, the tailor jumped into the river. The rushing water swept away this unfortunate soul, joining the company of river spirits. The police then swaggered away, claiming that they were following orders from above and had no choice. It is said that the tailor was from Yancheng, making a living in Jiangnan due to poverty. He was in his thirties, with elderly parents and young children at home.</p>
<p>▲ A New Bride Saves Her Husband and Kills a Thief. The world is deteriorating. During this summer season, burglaries in the countryside have become frequent, not waiting for the end of winter. After my return, within a week, there were three burglary cases within a few miles, all with the same cruel methods: placing the homeowner on a cauldron and setting it on fire. In a small village, a farmer recently married a husband surnamed Zhou. Zhou was diligent and thrifty, and had accumulated a small amount of savings after many years of work. Not long after marrying into the family, he was targeted by thieves. About seven or eight people conspired and broke into the house. It was midnight. The wife woke up and quickly woke her still-sleeping husband, telling him to escape quickly. She then stood guard at the bedroom door, holding two sickles, which were farm tools. Fortunately, the thieves had no firearms, and only carried knives and clubs. The wife was strong and powerful, wielding the two sickles like mandarin duck swords. The thieves could not enter the room. They retreated out the door, and the wife pursued them, fighting the thieves in the courtyard. The thieves surrounded her from all sides, and knives and clubs rained down. The wife was wounded on the forehead, and blood covered her face, but she became even more enraged. She struck down one thief with force, severing his arm, and he fell to the ground and died. The others were also wounded and scattered like birds and beasts. At dawn, the ground was covered in blood. People said that Zhou was spared the tragedy of being burned alive thanks to the wife's strength. For a woman to rely on farm tools to defeat a group of thieves, how brave is that! However, her determination to save her husband was the cause.</p>

<p>▲ Qianliju's Unique Famous Play: Qianliju, the grand master of the Cantonese opera world, has enjoyed great fame in the Pearl River Delta for twenty years without declining. Qianliju's performances follow the rules and regulations, and his art is difficult to surpass. Therefore, when Mei Lanfang visited Guangdong three times, he always went to watch Qianliju's performances repeatedly and spoke to people with a rigorous attitude, saying that Qianliju is truly a perfect man in Cantonese opera. Among the plays performed by Qianliju, "Sacrificing a Son to Serve the Mother-in-Law," "Pulling a Cart and Being Humiliated," "Boating," and "Sending Gifts" have gained the most fame. It is said that Qianliju has come to Shanghai from Guangdong and will perform at the Guangdong Grand Theater. Due to the large number of requests to perform the play "Sacrificing a Son to Serve the Mother-in-Law," it has been decided to perform it during the day. The scenes of "Serving Medicine," "Mandarin Duck Alliance," "Serving the Mother-in-Law," "Reproaching the Daughter," and "Mistakenly Judging a Good Wife and Overseeing the Execution at the Execution Ground" are particularly intense. Moreover, it is based on the principle of social education, which is enough to change the customs of the day. (Yan Lu)</p>
<p>▲ Exhibition Dates for the Exhibition of Paintings and Calligraphy by Famous Figures of Ancient and Modern Times: The exhibition of paintings and calligraphy by famous figures of ancient and modern times, held at the Huguenin School on Glock Road in the French Concession, has been crowded with visitors since its opening on the 13th. This is because the ancient paintings of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties displayed by the association are all private treasures that are not easily shown to others. This time, at the invitation of Jiang Zhenhua, the host of the association, they have been exceptionally displayed. The original opening was scheduled for the 15th, but due to the requests of visitors from afar, the exhibition has been extended to the 24th. It is said that many representatives of overseas Chinese from Nanyang who are visiting Beijing have also taken the time to visit, praising it as a lifelong pleasure. They particularly praised the works of Huang Binhong. Huang's works are not easily seen outside. This time, at the persistent request of the host, Jiang, quite a few are on display. However, most have already been reserved, and those who arrive later will have to wait for a while. (Menghua)</p>
<p>▲ Yang Naimei Appears at the Qixi Festival Gala: Film star Yang Naimei has returned to Shanghai after being away for three years. She is temporarily staying at an inn. She has been staying indoors due to a toothache, so few people know about it. Yesterday, she suddenly participated in the Qixi Festival Gala, performing songs and dances. Her adopted brother, You Guanren, also took the stage at the same time. The gala was initiated by the seven brothers of the literary and artistic circles: Wei Nong, Xiong Fei, Yao Liang, Ting Chao, Yifen, Tang Liang, and Shanhong. The gentlemen who were invited to the gala that evening were all colleagues in the literary and artistic circles. (Fang Gong)</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Since reading the history of India, observing its social organization, and participating in various social activities, I have come to understand the lives of people outside of China. Seeing the way the Indian people support their religious leader Gandhi, I now understand that the so-called Brahminism (here, using Buddhist scriptures with a slight hint of contempt) is not to be underestimated in its content, which is roughly similar to Buddhism. Let us compare and discuss it. Among the world's religions, those east of India include Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. Those west of India include Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism. There are now six factions. If we add the old imperial capitalism and the newly emerging Russian Marxism, they are also known as the eight major factions. Religion is discussed, but politics is also included. First, China is the religion of the Principle of the People's Livelihood. Since Confucius's emphasis on the people's welfare, the "July Fire Flow" and "September Clothing Distribution" of the Three Dynasties, the "Filial Piety and Diligence in Farming" of the Han Dynasty, and the "Farming and Reading" of the Song and Ming Dynasties all reflect this. It is not related to religion. The tenets of this religion are not favored by the Indian people. Daoist philosophy is far inferior to that of India and is not an enemy of the Indian people. Buddhism, on the other hand, lacks ethical and economic organization and does not emphasize deities. It has been defeated by Hinduism and driven out of all of India. (This is what the Indian people say.) The three religions of China are not enemies of Hinduism. Islam, backed by military force, once ruled India, but the result was a great failure. It is not worth the Indian people's attention and cannot govern India. Christianity lacks philosophy. In the view of the Indian people, it is not worthy of study. Therefore, the two religions, Islam and Christianity, have failed in Hinduism after hundreds of years of experimentation, even when supported by political power. These five major religions of the world are not enemies of Hinduism. Hinduism is now being widely disseminated in the Americas. A new Buddha, Gandhi, has emerged with great fanfare, causing a great stir. The Indian people worship Gandhi, calling him a god and Buddha, even more so than the Chinese worship Sun Yat-sen and the Americans worship Washington. Moreover, the Indian people's love for their wives, the wives' love for their husbands, and the children's love for their mothers all contain divine meaning. They call their mothers goddesses. They extend this to cows and their entire families, as they provide milk. Therefore, they call cows great mothers. From this perspective, the Indian people are also deeply emotional. In short, none of the world's five religions can shake Hinduism, which has been tested for thousands of years.</p>
<p>However, in the future, two major factions will emerge that will challenge Hinduism. What will happen then? One is imperial capitalism, and the other is Russian communism. First, imperial capitalism. The Indian religious leader Gandhi uses only a coarse cloth filial piety hat and robe to resist it. (It is indeed the item used by the Chinese in mourning.) The British lose 600 million yuan a year, which means that the foundation of the empire is already shaken. It is also not enough to control the Indian people's lives. However, Russianism is greatly admired by young people. It may be a problem in the future. However, I observe that Gandhi's followers originally came from Tolstoy-like ideologies. Many have also studied in Russia. Even if Russia is able to invade India southward, India will definitely not become a swallowed and digested Russified nation. In my opinion, the three organizations of politics, economics, and society in India in the future must create a new system between Tolstoy and Marx. Brahmanism. I used to despise it when I read Buddhist scriptures. Now I know that it is a copper wall and iron bastion, having survived after grinding and competing with various ideologies of the world.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Thus, the conflict between the two parties began. Like a rabid dog unleashing its bestial nature, this was Xiao Rong. Xiao Rong completely forgot that the woman lying on the ground was his wife. He only saw her as an enemy destroying his career. But Xiao Rong's wife deeply remembered that he was her husband, the only son of her father-in-law and mother-in-law, the light of her hope. But now he was conquered by anger, and the deception had stung her deeply. Amidst the ever-changing emotions, everything lost the harmony that should exist between a couple.</p>
<p>Miss Ding saw Xiao Rong's cruel actions for the first time. Besides sighing for herself and pitying others, she could not bear it.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lu! I think... you shouldn't be making such a scene here. Why don't you go back to Suzhou to talk? But you should also know that although women in the world are weak, they may always have a chance for revenge!" She always spoke in this cold and sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's flames of anger seemed to have been fueled by humiliation. He had been venting everything on his wife. Suddenly, he forcefully dragged his wife, disregarding everything, all the way from upstairs to downstairs, and then out the door. Although Qiu Zi was pulling him and Miss Ding was trying to stop him, everything failed, and they could only tolerate the further development of this tragedy as much as possible.</p>
<p>The rain was falling even harder. The raindrops did not know people's pain, and they attacked the earth relentlessly. The thunder was like beating war drums, and the lightning was like igniting guiding torches. The dark clouds and violent wind further highlighted the tension of the moment. Xiao Rong was like a madman, no, more like a mad dog, unaware of all of this. He opened the door of the Ding family's house, and even such heavy rain did not reduce his advancing anger. Xiao Rong's wife was crying and wailing, being dragged on the ground by Xiao Rong. Her tears almost turned into blood, her voice was hoarse, and her strength was exhausted. No one was able to stop her husband's violence.</p>

<h3 id="e191">The Shanghai Financial Community's Concerns About Lending to Hankou <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai financial community has always had significant financial and commercial exchanges with Hankou, relying on the circulation of goods and the turnover of funds. This time, the entire Hankou area has been flooded, commercial activities have been suspended, and a thriving commercial port has become a watery country. There is no possibility of financial exchanges. According to surveys, the amount lent to Hankou, both fixed-term and non-fixed-term, is no less than five or six million. Although the end of the year is still far away, time flies, and it will arrive in a blink of an eye. It is unknown whether it can be repaid. According to the hopes of people in the Shanghai financial community, they would feel very fortunate if half of it could be recovered. This shows the difficulty of doing business in Hankou.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Yarn and Cotton Market Turns Flat from Decline <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and flattened in the afternoon, with a still weak trend. Due to the slump in the world cotton market, Three Goods Yarn has been falling sharply for days, causing panic. Speculators continued to emerge, but a certain large short seller slightly covered their positions, with some going near and some going far. Although new sellers made some offerings, they were all absorbed by the large short sellers, so the market did not appear extremely weak. Actual sales in the market were more active, with the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs purchasing more of 10-count coarse yarn. Confidence slightly strengthened. Due to a certain manufacturer's assessment of strong actual demand, they have been controlling the yarn market this month, with a strong trend of purchasing goods. Driven by this, the far months may temporarily fluctuate between 52 and 53 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Human Biao Did Not See Major Weakness The Human Biao market opened with continuous declines in American cotton, leading to weak sentiment. After falling by one or two taels each, large players bought in aggressively, strengthening the market. As a result, each month fell by five, six, seven, or eight qian. In the afternoon, news of good spot prices caused a rebound of three, four, or five qian, with the current month rising by one tael. Transactions totaled 44,650 bales. Sales included 1,450 bales by Mingde, 2,200 bales by Rongxing, 1,250 bales by Houfengchang, 1,150 bales by Shunda, 1,250 bales by Gongtai, 1,050 bales by Yiyu, 950 bales by Tianlong, and 700 bales by Shenxin. Purchases included 2,200 bales by Meiji, 2,600 bales by Ruida, 1,550 bales by Yitong, 2,500 bales by Xincheng, and 1,150 bales by Mingde. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Cotton Market Shows No Sign of Improvement <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market slightly declined, with a still weak trend. Most cotton merchants in the local area are inclined to buy in, because the flood situation in Hankou is rising and not receding, and the harvest from all routes may not be good. Therefore, the intention to go long is very strong. However, the world cotton market is in a state of no return, and new low prices are gradually being discovered. There are also many large players who are aggressively shorting. The spot price of American cotton, Mitterling, is calculated to be close to 30 taels in Chinese currency, only equivalent to 29 taels and 7 qian. The local cotton mills have no intention of inquiring, while foreign firms and foreign companies are selling actively in the market. The prices are said to be particularly negotiable. As for the manufacturers, they are all watching the world trend and not taking action.</p>
<p>▲ Han Biao Fell by Three Qian The Exchange's Han Biao market opened, following the decline in American cotton, sentiment was still flat, with each month falling slightly by two and a half qian to one and a half qian. In the afternoon, it rebounded by five fen, but the Three Goods Cotton of Toyo fell by six or seven jiao per day. Total transactions for the day were 110,300 dan. Sales included 4,200 dan by Yongfeng, 3,000 dan by Dachang, 2,400 dan by Yiyuan, 3,400 dan by Xincheng, 3,000 dan by Yuanda, 2,300 dan by Changfeng, 6,300 dan by Tianlong, 2,300 dan by Rongxing, 2,200 dan by Yuande, 3,500 dan by Changfeng, and 2,600 dan by Xinheng.

<p>▲ The source of each gang in the South Market yesterday was still continuous, and the stock in Pucun was thick, about 100 or more, mostly residing in the inn. However, the seller was unwilling to compromise, the high price was slightly reduced, and the middle accommodation was more stagnant. The market price was not fixed. Slightly thin early rice arrived, but fresh top was lacking, the high price was slightly purchased in this street, and the second-class goods were not moving. The shape presented a fixed image, thick and thin japonica rice, still in a revolving situation, the high price of Yanglu pointed out was still rare, the second-class goods were stagnant, the price was unchanged, and the negative transformation was sold as soon as it arrived, the price was lifted by a corner.</p>
<p>▲ The source of Xinzha West Road, the early rice was still lacking in the morning, and the high-priced goods in the river were about dozens of ships, and the market was freshly called up by one angle. The middle level of shanglu and xiaoluo had limited fluctuations. The customer's telegram showed that the rear-end cargo could not be turned strong due to the cost of the blood. The top level of Suchang japonica rice and Yixing and Jiangyin rice were limited to the end. The market was lifted by two angles, and the negative yuan was also the same. It was difficult to stabilize the sharp end of Luyang. The foreign rice cargo was still weak. The sales of customer gang and the street turned active, and the situation turned up.</p>

<p>▲ The Total Stock in the City is Less Than 30,000 Packages</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was even more active, because the street continued to sell 1,500 packages of small silk rice the night before, and the price stepped up by several points to 13 yuan and 8 angles. After this ticket was sold, the market was greatly boosted yesterday morning, and the actual sales of the national households were still strong. The cargo owner still called for a high angle and a half, and the price was 13 yuan and 9 and a half angles, and the in-house also offered 13 yuan and 9 angles, and refused to sell. Other rice have been raised by several points, because the recent orders are not cost-effective, and there is not much rice in the market. Statistics show that there are less than 30,000 packages in total, so the cargo owner's mind is very firm and unwilling to sell easily. Yesterday, a No. 1 Saigon 300 package was opened, the price was 14 yuan and 8 and a half angles, Annam was more than 400 package, the price was 14 yuan and 3 angles, and the Hong Kong rice was 300 package, the price was 12 yuan and 9 angles, all of which were received by this street.

<p>▲ The Spot Goods Are Rare and Steady</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was generally flat and tired. Although the domestic floods swept the country and the price of grain was bound to soar, there was still no way to deal with the foreign surplus. Now that the disaster in our country is getting worse, the US government has re-proposed a large number of wheat loans to our country. In recent days, this matter may become a reality, so many bulls outside the industry are inevitably shocked. Those with weak minds have gradually come out, and the market has gradually become loose. As a result, this month is two points smaller than the previous day, September is three points smaller, October is one point smaller, and November to January are two points smaller. The spot wheat is not rich in arrival, and they are all thinking about selling, and the price is steady. Kunshan, Liuhe, Penglai, and Pudong opened more than 1,000 packages, which were handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>

The price is still firm.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>(A) North of the Somme River, the British Third Army advances towards the direction of Bapaume and Polong.</p>
<p>(B) East of the Scarpe River, the French Tenth Army advances towards the roads of Schenies and Scheniesayason.</p>
<p>I added the following sentences at the end of the letter:</p>
<p>The French army has achieved such results with independent attacks. It can be seen that this offensive will be more promising if it is extended to both wings.</p>
<p>Since July 15th, the enemy army has driven no fewer than 120 divisions to the front lines. Our army has now reached a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With such achievements, we should make further efforts to achieve complete success. The above-mentioned attacks should be carried out as soon as possible. Success or failure depends on this.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 12th, I met Marshal Haig and Commander Petain near Aye. They and I were being received by the King of England. They expressed their complete agreement with the military order just mentioned. Our army will begin a series of fierce attacks to implement the new plan. (To be continued)</p>
