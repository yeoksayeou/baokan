<p>六月廿三日午後六時。偕黃警頑氏謁見週遊西藏印度歸來之譚雲山氏。談話所得。摭記如下。</p>
<p>譚雲山氏前在印度大詩哲太戈爾氏創辦之國際大學任中文敎授。十九年冬由緬甸赴西藏。考察西藏之文化宗敎。本年四月一日復由西藏返抵印度。週遊印度各佛敎地及印度東西南北各大都會。考察佛迹。同遊者有上海尊孔中學校長劉秀南氏。道階法師。計經。菩提伽耶禮佛等成正覺處。而靈　山。諸佛說法處。而那蘭陀。三藏法師取經處而鹿野苑。佛轉法輪處。而俱絺那。禮佛湼盤處。而南屏尼。禮佛降生處。而舍衛國。祇樹給孤獨園世尊說法處等。考察以上諸大聖跡。且得佛國紀念證物頗多。復次經德利。Ｄelhi昔爲印度京都。參觀皇宮。及新德利國會議院。總督府。博物館等。</p>
<p>譚氏在西印巴多利與甘地會遇。同居數日。甘地每日黎明四時起身。散步至五時半。某日黎明。甘氏擬約譚氏出外散步。譚正酣睡甘氏並不喚醒。後謂譚曰。「我已來數次。先生總睡着。」譚答曰。「先生何不喚醒我。」甘氏答曰。「先生昨天辛苦了。應該多睡幾時。」其尊重人家自由。和愛精神有如此。</p>
<p>甘氏常赴鄕間。受民衆熱烈歡呼。集資饋物甘氏。小孩一見甘氏。都來撫摸頭脚。表示親愛。甘氏亦温柔若「綿羊」然。窮民無資購物。將自己紡織之紗布饙貽。其人格感化國人有如此者。</p>

<p>大刀隊者。漁溪鄕民所組以禦匪者也。福建上游多匪。益以盧敗之後。其部屬無家可歸。有復本來面目。復淪爲寇者。於是閩北之民。陷水愈深。蹈火愈熱。漁溪向稱安謐。至是亦遭蹂躪。鄕人患之。因徵壯丁。組大刀隊以自衛。督其隊者。爲江西人。有奇術。能以符咒禦槍砲。戰時。吞符數紙。粘符於胸際數紙。相約不得開口。開口符即不靈。匪以槍來。毫不爲動。以砲來。稍量即蘇。以是匪爲披靡。平日散居各處。各務其業。有警笛鳴即合。戰械。用大刀。不以槍砲。故謂之大刀隊。隊紀甚嚴。嗜烟酒者。不得入隊。貪財物者。不得入隊。曾爲盜匪者。亦不得入隊。是事也。我聞之漁溪客談。當能確實云。</p>

<p>— 綺雲女士</p>
<p>我是最愛讀小說的。一編在手。輒忘寢食。但是我覺得不論中外的小說。與其欣賞他文字的雋妙。不如欣賞他情節的曲折。因此我敢說「西廂記」沒有「紅樓夢」好「三國志」沒有「水滸傳」好。便是「西綫無戰事」也沒有「空谷蘭」好。「復活」也沒有「梅花落」好。雖然在文學的立塲上批評不是這樣的。但是在我讀書的興趣的立塲上却總覺得情節越曲折越好</p>
<p>我曾經讀過一本「紅涙影」小說。覺得他的情節比較我所看過的任何一部書都要曲折。裹面是寫「一個富貴公子戀愛了一個貧家女子。因爲社會家庭都不能同情於她們的婚姻。不得不遠適異邦。過着秘密的生活。後來那個貴公子因承襲遺産歸去。托女於一老婦人。時女已生一掌珠。而已則憂憤以死。貴公子回去了後。差不多給人强迫似地别娶了。不料那個妻子也忽然因病死去。於是他就立志不再娶。還到老婦人那裹來領回他的女兒。但是那個老婦人心懷不善。竟把自己的女兒李代桃僵地給了他。反把他的女兒當做自己的女兒。那個老婦人的女兒是一個無情無義驕奢淫佚的人。但是他自己的女兒却十分幽嫺貞靜。因此釀成了幾次的怪劇。後來那個貴公子要給女兒招贅一個女婿。那裹知道那個少年竟不愛他的女兒。（其實是老婦人的女兒）而愛上了老婦人的女兒。（其實是貴公子的眞女兒）就幾乎發生了謀殺的慘劇。後來老婦人良心發現。才把這件秘密吐露出來。事情才得大白」。它的情節的曲折。我的律也實在不能描繪其萬一。我覺得這一本小說。實在是最使我愛讀的。現在據說明星影片公司已經把他攝成「紅涙影」影片。那麽銀幕上表演的力量。一定更比書中所描寫的巧妙得多了。</p>

<p>十九日。回敎敎授及學生多有知波斯文語者。語予波斯事。且云昔波斯有馬奴敎傳入中國事。予問今馬奴敎尙存在否。答以無。據彼云昔回敎王窘馬奴敎。致書中國。中國王答。亦願同窘馬奴敎徒。不許在中國。此事余不知確否。應在唐宋間。波斯與中國之交通頗難考。按波穆天子傳今地考。直謂周穆王西遊。與西王母結婚。并指穆天子傳中景物。爲今波斯京城伊斯巴亨。蔣觀雲中國人種考。亦云外國書有云襄王佗有與波斯女王結婚事。本來東西之不通。均由回敎諸國隔絶之故。而中國上古是否有此兩王結婚之事。顧蔣均主其說。余今問之研波斯史之回敎友人。亦難明也。意當問之波斯人矣。</p>

<p>爲鞋商。據云凡三家在此市。彼全家住此數十年矣。中印度者多鞋店。因印人缺此製造也。不久果見有六七華人來此。云從拉克惱來。今日是舊歷過年節。故來遊耳。但余見其遊玩生活。全是打牌。因念各地華人大致如此。亦中國人之大缺點也。少有暇。盡耗其精神於賭博。奈之何哉。因憶在中國。曾與最高智識者談論。彼爲敎育界最高之人。而亦嗜賭。問我以原故。予止能說是習慣而已。又據友人敎育家談此。彼研究賭性之原理。亦殊不易取消。余念此亦爭鬥性之一種。久之遂成習慣也。印人甚愛買中國貨。因抵英貨。尤愛華貨。是日回敎禁食期滿。滿街汽車馬車等。載鮮衣羣行者。皆回敎人也。回友與余步遊市上。本來此市極淸潔。其路寛廣淸潔。若北京之交民巷。回敎友人頗有俠氣。好運動。至其家。見室中好飾以鹿角牛耳。但斷鹿之頭。連角飾於墻上余見之心頗不安。只取其角可也。并其頭則不雅。</p>

<p>蘭陵西去。有望仙橋。相傳丁令威化鶴歸來所經也。橋畔居民久成市集。中一家朱氏生三女。長曰鶑。次曰鳳。三曰燕。鶯早嫁矣。而不滿於夫家。初非天壤王郎之恨也。女性悍。不能事翁姑。甚至以武力對待。爲隣里所不容。涉訟經年未解。以是常居母家焉。時時伴妹閨中。與鳳私語。極言女子出嫁之非計。舉已事作前車鑒。運廣長舌。說現身法。勸鳳抱獨身主義。浸潤之讚。膚受之愬。朝斯夕斯。於是鳳爲所惑。而願作嬰兒子矣。堂上二老固夢夢也。及去歲之秋。鳳嫁有日矣。而堅守阿姊之戒。彩輿臨門。面壁掩泣。父母曁戚　交勸之。矢弗從也。然而臨時背約。貽誤佳期。主婚者何以白冰人。相持久之。不得已轉商諸幼女燕。謀李代桃僵。爲移花接木計。燕慨然諾之。遂妝以登輿。洞房之夕。新郎於枕畔詢知其故。轉感女之多情。而愛敬有加焉。自是燕每歸寗。必偕新婿。鶼鶼鰈鰈。形影不離。而鳳則小姑居處依舊無郎。而年事且長矣。眼見一個如意郎君。無端讓與小妹。冷暖相形。頓生悔恨。每與燕夫婦相値。又羞又妬。由是連枝蘭蕙。竟成避面尹邢。而鶯猶未知其情也。一日見鳳談燕夫婦相愛狀。笑謂新婚則然耳。後日之悔。當如我也。鳳嗤之以鼻曰。阿姊休矣。姊之所爲如何。尙不省咎由自取。而謂天下女子出嫁者盡如姊耶。鶯弗能忍。報以惡聲。由是姊妹成仇。相與不交一語焉。視鄰知其事者。莫不謂鶯之自誤誤人。而憐鳳之空閨雙影。錯鑄九州。秋月春風。恨成千古。近且以狂疾聞矣。嗟乎。女子善懷。佳人薄命。紅顏黃土。旦暮可期。如鳳者亦情天怨海中一重公案也已。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良先把一百多本作文簿，分一分開。因爲這是三級的，題目也有三個　　先把它分做三幢，然後在一年級的一疊裹頭，取一本下來，來了一遍，打算動筆了。忽聽得後門一響，娘姨出去買小菜了，夫人在下面呌着：</p>
<p>「子良！」</p>
<p>子良特地不響，曉得伊沒有什麽要緊事情的，一答應伊，反致纒擾不休。</p>
<p>「子良！你下來！」</p>
<p>潘子良先從水孟裹，超一超水到硯台上，用墨磨了幾磨，要尋筆時，書桌上竟沒有。</p>
<p>「子良！你爲什麽不做聲？」</p>
<p>一枝筆那裹去了呢？子良細細一想，記起來了。昨天看伊畫過鞋頭花的，一定是我的筆。子良即忙趕到前面房裹，在沿窗桌上一隻針綫籐匾裹一尋，居然把一枝羊毫筆尋到了。</p>
<p>「子良！你睡着了麽？你生夢遊病麽？」</p>
<p>伊聽得了樓板上的脚聲，故意這麽說。子良回到亭子間中時，聽得有人叩門，月如去開門了。子良蹲着身體，視綫從客堂裹板壁上面的木條馬眼塊中望出去，方知開了門進來的，是一個郵差，子良便坐下去做自己的事。</p>
<p>大門一關，月如又趕到樓上來了，子良只見伊手中拿一個巨大的封袋。</p>
<p>「王仁甫的父親死了，訃聞來咧。」</p>
<p>說着，伊把訃聞授與子良，子良接過來，也不看，對桌上一放。伊說：「他老人家一向多病，到底死了。前幾年，我就曉得他要死了，到現在死，他眞是第一次死。」</p>
<p>夫人對子良書桌上一看：</p>
<p>「我像呌魂那麽呌你，你一聲也不答應，原來在這裹修改作文。好！好！我也來做一篇文章，請你替我改改！」</p>

<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源尙湧、約有念六七號、本城去路寥寥無幾、因天氣炎熱、各米號不願多添、市面日見步跌、午節以來、各貨行情步小一元半、人心平定、昨厚粳與早晚稻又各短一二角、炒杜类到銷二平、上落有限、糯米到貨雖少、然去化更呆、開盤降去五分、蓋浦江中存積尙厚、洋米又復平落、加之寗胃全無、有此種種關係市形未見回高、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又見巨大之動搖、因金價又復暴瀉、匯率日長、國外粉麥、勢須逐步活動、環境如是、業内外心思、自然均爲帶動、故開價後本月份及七月份均低至二兩、八月份至二兩零七厘半、九月份至二兩零二分半、十月份至二兩零四分半、十一月份至二兩零四分七厘半、較前日計落二分左右、以後因浮空獲利抵補、稍稍回振、迨至下午開盤、各月　市氣、大致盤旋、因廠抛略懈、内地帮則購買頗力、故局勢爲之抬住、惟以前途言、因匯率放長、洋麥又可步步訂購、將來恐難樂觀也、結果本月份及八九月份未動、七月份微好二厘半、十十一月份小五厘半云、</p>
<h3 id="c128">麥價午前暴落 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午又呈暴落之象、因金價一落千丈、洋麥合價、步步鬆動、此路一開、人心衝動、異常勇猛、蓋此種環境、屢經嘗試、無論如何、不能巧避、故本月份雖停拍、七月份以下、則步步大落、較前日有七八九分之跌勢、迨至下午開盤、人心似稍穩定、以粉市疲而復挺、各月份略形帶振、但行家之定洋麥者、又成交數批、如澳麥定價祗四兩一錢半、芝加哥之二號曰麥、還價祗四兩零六分、照此情形、後步實有重落之可能也、結果七月份較前日跌五分、八月份跌六分、九十月份跌五分、十一月份跌七分、現麥因廠胃仍懈、中次貨喊價又低三五分不等、開湖州·吳淞·安亭·南京·蓬萊·揚州麥共一千九百餘包由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、因滬白廠經里昂實銷發動、日趨堅漲、緣法綢廠秋綢需要原料頗殷、絲電續有轉滬、成交雖難暢達、而市氣俏利、昨由信孚等進滬白廠白廠經五十包、中和進白乾經二十包、價仍堅挺云、</p>

<p>紐約市塲入夏以來、因日絲商廉價競銷、致日絲開價不振、茲因日本政府限制夏秋蠶繭生産、加以春繭歉收、橫濱日絲市價日漲、紐約日絲價亦隨之上升、前日Ａ字級開二元九角Ｂ字級兩元四角五分Ｃ字級一元九角、每磅各漲美金四五角云、</p>

<p>昨日祁門紅茶僅怡和洋行及華茶公司買進百餘箱、價均趨跌十餘兩、路莊珍眉綠茶、去路仍趨呆滯、土莊貨雖由錦隆洋行買進二一百箱、但市盤開至五十二兩、較前又低四五兩、現下各路來源、並不暢旺、華商態度、多因茶數缺額、堅疲不一、惟就大勢論之、前途未能樂觀也、</p>

<p>婺邑子茶、連日經山戶採摘、出貨甚踴、惟號方因春茶進辦無多、需要至急、頗呈求過於供、一般茶販、蜂起搜辦、甚有持燈坐守茶戶、俟茶甫熖乾、强行取去、或朝竹定價、夜即秤茶者、搶辦之烈實所罕見、市價每斤仍自六角五分至七角、堅挺未下、山戶以子茶價高頭茶、無不樂採出售、故日來茶戶採製之熱鬧、不减於春茶、兼之頭茶發育未足之茶樹、抽芽異常濃密、大約每擔茶樹、可採子茶三十斤質味香厚、比之頭茶有過之無不及、</p>

<p>秋塲所銷之毛貨呢　、如爛糊呢·印花呢·麥　登·平厚呢·帽子呢·紗毛呢等、日來索樣者不少、本客帮　有預購、查今庚此種毛貨、新近由國外運到不多、各號又少定貨、蓋受關稅增加之影響、雖舊存之貨亦不少、但杯水車薪、不敷走銷、故開價比其他毛貨爲貴、而以爛糊呢·印花呢兩種爲尤甚、買方亦洞悉此中情形、故多相率預先搜辦預測秋令上市之際、其售價必更堅漲云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價未變動、紐約期糖九月及明年度五月份均比跌二分、餘月亦各跌一分、爪哇現期糖亦仍少起伏、公會市塲劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣沉寂、出戶頗盛、價鬆至十一兩二錢、而問津仍寥、二十號中砂白十兩零六錢、交易亦稀、市形之弱、實所罕　、日糖市雖復挫、進出尙覺活躍、Ｎ嘜十兩零八錢、ＳＨ嘜十兩零五錢半、Ｉ嘜十一兩二錢、ＹＲＯ嘜十兩零四錢半、ＹＴ嘜十兩零七錢半、ＹＰ嘜十一兩一錢七分半、陳貨十一兩一錢、ＬＫ嘜十兩零八錢、ＴＭ嘜十兩零六錢半、太古Ｂ嘜陳貨十一兩一錢七分半、市形均見平定、號盤交易殊寂、日糖廠盤ＡＲＡＥ對搭八九月份貨扯價日金四元六角、略有問津、聞已去電廠方、須待回電作數云、</p>

<p>喬扮軍警··航警繳械</p>

<p>匪盜上船　石浦在三門灣港南、爲象山縣屬重要海岸、商店林立、自上海開行滬台班輪後、該埠商業、更爲發達、該處日有滬輪到埠、而内港各處、爲滬輪所不能到達者、另有較小之永浦海遊等船、行駛泗洲寗海岳津各埠、與滬台六船聯絡接班、本月十九日、永浦輪由石浦開出時、有匪盜喬扮軍警者三十餘名、多穿舊破制服、上船時船員亦不疑、詎船離石浦海面、即行騎刦、</p>
<p>刦掠情形　永浦輪開到地名巡檢司洋面時、匪徒中即有一人出艙號召、各匪羣出手槍、先將駐輪護航警四人繳械、並關禁下艙、復上舵樓、監視船長、又將船員驅閉一室、各匪徒遂先將賬房打開、搜刦現欵、復將在船旅客、逐一抄刦、凡銀錢飾物衣服等項、全數搜掠一空、共計損失一萬五六千元、刦得之貨、堆存一處、由匪看守、</p>
<p>綁架旅客　匪等壓逼船主、向東開行、歷經一日一夜之久、船到海門洋面、各匪之刦掠目的、亦已達到、遂在該處狂吹警笛、即有匪船一艘、應聲而至、似早先預約定者、靠近永浦輪、乃將所刦之贜、一一搬入匪舟、臨去之際、又將在船乘客中綁去十餘名、多爲商業界人、匪衆又欲將船上引擎機件拆卸、經船長一再跪求、方始得免、</p>
<p>還浦報告　該輪今次被匪刦掠、歷經四日四夜之久、公司方面、日夕焦慮、而無法知其下落、迨至二十四日、永浦輪始經匪盜釋放還石浦、但到埠時、船員乘客咸留空身、錢物盡失、被綁之各家屬、更於得訊後、痛哭不休、船長向公司報告遇匪詳情、以便請外海警廳追緝、</p>
<p>善後狀况　永浦還抵石浦之後、該公司已將此事經過、電滬報請海軍司令部、迅速派艦追捕、而本埠滬台班内各輪局、在永浦被盜以後、亦各提議防範之計、對於旅客乘船、嚴加注意、凡形跡可疑·及往來地址不明者、槪行拒絶乘船、以免發生重大危險云、</p>

<p>由德國肺結核雜誌抄譯</p>
<p>（一）肺癆必死說之由來</p>
<p>行之　　　多。然醫家之難。　蔓之廣。未有如肺結核（即肺癆病）者。肺結核之侵虐吾人。　　　　。無有間斷。爲害人最深殺人最多之傳染病。吾人所最恐怖者也。伊古以來。斷定　　　　死　。良以罹之之後。實難療治。故醫士遇之。束手無策。患者遇之。心　膽落。日有　　之憂而已矣。及到近代。醫學進步。名醫輩出。精密研究。始知肺結核實非必死之絶症。如　　　法。初期中治愈者。十之八九。即歷二三期者。亦有就痊之希望。　罹病過久。旣　　後末期之患者。無療救之法。然罹病甚久。以致不能療治者。不獨肺結核爲然。願罹此病者。於其初中期。愼毋怠忽。療養可也。</p>
<p>（二）肺癆病原菌之發現</p>
<p>自古以來。中西醫界。就肺癆之病原體。曾有許多種種之空論臆說。均暗黑不明矣。最近有德國　　　大家考克博士。發見結核菌爲肺癆病之原因。破此千萬古黑暗。而發一線之大光明。彼虎死拉　爲虎列拉病之原因。白喉菌爲白喉病菌之原因。赤痢菌爲赤病之原因。其他若梅毒之發生。基於梅毒菌。癩病之發生。亦基於癩菌。諒爲舉世共知。肺結核亦然。其發生之原因。基於結核菌。此菌最喜侵襲人類。其棲息繁殖。大抵在吾人之肺臟中。人類之被其害者。不可勝算。往時占世界人口七分之一。近代占六分之一。都市則達五分之一。實爲流行最廣之傳染病也。</p>
<p>（三）肺病者之二大恩人</p>
<p>（一）德國考克博士　一八四三年。生於德國葛勞司城。家可大康。故幼年安心向學。中學卒業後。歷入國中諸大學。研究醫藥學。年未三十。即發明　之細菌。國中名醫。爲之傾倒。越數載。於一八八二年三月二十四日。考克博士。乃以研究發明之肺結核菌。發表於德京柏林生理學大會席上。當時各國醫學界。爲之震動。德國政府。嘉其精學。任考克博士爲衛生院院長。各國帝王。又贈高等勳章。各國大學。爭以名譽學位寄贈。一九零五年。諾伯爾醫學巨奬。亦及老氏。可謂極學界之尊榮。今之醫治肺癆者。無不基於考氏之發明。其有功於救人濟世。誠世界人類之所當感謝者也。</p>
<p>（二）德國柏格爾博士　自考克博士發見結核菌爲肺結核之病原體以來。東西結核學者。爭先研究。欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果。盡歸失敗。蓋歷來一般醫家。因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性搆造。自柏格爾博士。苦心研究後。始發見肺結核菌。有一種特殊之防禦力。能抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊。蓋結核菌體。係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜所搆成。</p>
<p>若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪性之武裝。則無由俘擒結核菌。而置之死地。因此我普天下肺病者之大恩師格柏爾博士。搜集一切動植礦物性各種藥物。而苦心研究。孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。歴盡幾許心膜腺壓縮汁中。有一特種有效成分。對於結核菌。有强力脫蠟之作用。此實前後千古醫學界一女擬問的肺結核根本療法之大成功也。</p>
<p>德國納得博士製肺内動脈及氣管支分布圖</p>
<p>（四）肺結核之特効療法</p>
<p>蓋肺結核（即肺癆）之原因是結核菌·而此菌一入人體内，則於該處，便成結節，以斷血行之路，又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質，包圍其體，以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入，故雖用種種殺菌藥，内服或注射，終不能達其病菌之實體内　歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法、對症療法，理學的療法，血淸療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等，尙未完全成功，而肺癆無藥之說，遍滿於一世者　因未知此深奥學理故耳　由此現代結核學者，根據上述之學理，繼續研究，不遺餘力，結果成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑，名曰三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者、據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實驗報告、此藥有滲透肺病　之結節及溶解蠟質之作用，　　有殺菌力，能根治一二三期之肺癆，確有萬靈之特效，在中國，業經國民政会中央衛生試驗所化驗，藥性和平無毒，絶無任何副作用，茲略舉醫治作用於下，</p>
<p>（一）設於試驗管中，實驗「三那星」之藥力作用，則一分鐘後，結核菌皆消失其抗酸性，至三分鐘後，則此肺結核菌，完全殺盡，無一倖免，</p>
<p>（二）依動物試驗，則發見「三地星」能滲入結核病𫂈内，設檢查其病　内潛伏之結核菌，則盡�</p>
<p>失其抗酸性，此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣，</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右，則立見咯痰稀釋，體熱下降等良好狀態，</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上，則顯見體重增加，食慾激進，一切症狀，逐漸緩和，終達其回天再造偉功，</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain American official stated that Bitterman recently spoke about the Jiangxi bandits, saying that if the government troops make an effort to suppress them, it will be easy to achieve results. However, the fundamental solution is to build railways running directly north-south through the bandit areas, so that the troops can arrive in the morning and evening, saving manpower and military expenses. The bandits would also be afraid to use convenient locations as lairs. If the Nanchang-Xunzhou road could be extended to Shaoguan earlier, there would be no bandit groups in southern Jiangxi. He also said that if the central government wants to unify Sichuan, it must wait until the Sichuan-Hankou railway is opened. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, Mo Dehui has not yet proposed the issue of redeeming the China Eastern Railway at a price. It is heard that the two sides discussed the issue of handing over the railway to China free of charge by a deadline, with the general idea being to hand it over to China a few years earlier than the original agreement. This is because Russia regards the China Eastern Railway as not very important. Russia has the Heilongjiang North Bank Railway for communication with the East and does not rely solely on the Eastern Railway. If we redeem it at a price, it would not be cost-effective for us. The Russian side still does not agree to organize and price the ruble. The nine previous discussions were all about the implementation methods of the two Sino-Russian Eastern Railway agreements, and the handover deadline has not been determined.

<h3 id="e27">The Outlet for Youth and Examinations <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The worries that youth feel today are: one is the inability to solve the ideological outlet, and the other is the inability to solve the professional outlet. Generally, in youth, there is a heart for the welfare of the country and the benefit of the people, and one thinks of how to place the people in a state of permanent peace, but in this complex world, it is not easy to obtain a correct ideological direction. Therefore, in the era of studying, youth only know how to devote themselves to studying, but the future benefits of what they learn, and the prospects are vast and cannot be known. This is the origin of the first worry. The second worry, the professional one, stems from the first worry. Having learned vaguely, which profession should one take to fulfill one's ambition for welfare? Secondly, which profession should one take to provide an outlet for one's personal life? Then one is at a loss as to what to do. At this time, one abandons one's past ambitions and seeks a profession for the purpose of maintaining one's livelihood. And at this time when everything is stagnating and all construction cannot develop, how much effort does the industry need from me? Then one is anxious and does not have time to choose, only seeking a position of temporary peace, which is also as difficult as climbing to heaven. This is also the origin of the second worry. Now, the higher examinations are regarded by the general youth as an excellent outlet. Those preparing to go to Beijing for the examinations are very enthusiastic. Today's examinations are a great ceremony for the country to employ talent. If one has expertise, one will be recruited. However, the recruitment is very limited. However, the general youth do not ask whether their learning is suitable for what they seek, and they all regard it as the only outlet. Then it can be imagined how narrow the outlet for youth is today. I very much hope that the leaders of all parties and society will urgently revive various industrial and commercial construction undertakings, so as to broaden the outlet for these youths.</p>

<p>The Gallery is Packed with Spectators, the Opposition Party Speaks Passionately, Fortunately, the Socialist Party Supports the Government, and the Government Achieves an Unexpected Victory, the Reply to the United States has Been Officially Published, Except for Requests for Material Compensation, US-French Negotiations Began Yesterday, and a Compromise is Expected to be Reached</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Paris, 26th - Today, the entire parliament felt very serious due to the debate on the Hoover plan. Both the public inside and outside the parliament and the diplomatic gallery were packed, with no room to stand. When Premier Laval first announced the meeting, Laval had just finished dining with US Treasury Secretary Mellon and French Foreign Minister Briand and Treasury Minister Flandin. When he ascended the stage, some people accused him of selling out the country for personal gain. However, Laval had no time to take care of everything and immediately began to read the original text of the US President Hoover plan. At the same time, the opposition party occasionally shouted abuse. Except for having to stop slightly when there was noise, Laval was generally very calm. After Laval finished reading the full text of the Hoover plan, he began to recite the French government's reply. The first section of the reply expressed agreement with the generous attitude of the United States. The second section mentioned the importance of international unity in the world and stated that France had previously made many contributions to this unity, such as promising to reduce German reparations, withdrawing troops from the Rhineland region, and signing the Young Plan for resolving reparations, etc., which were more than enough. However, now France clearly has to make painful sacrifices again, which are not limited to financial losses and will fundamentally shake the credibility of all existing contractual obligations. If the unconditional annuity in the Young Plan can be discussed with other conditional payments, then all principles can be overturned, and the Young Plan can be arbitrarily violated. It continued that Germany's economic difficulties should be solved mainly through loans, and on the French side, if the parliament can approve the plan, France will pay the same amount as the French part of the unconditional annuity to the International Clearing Bank for application. The detailed plan should be promoted by future negotiation methods, but it should not be different from the original principles of President Hoover's plan. After the French reply was read, only weak cheers were heard in the government seats, and soon they were drowned out by the opposition's angry shouts. Afterwards, Laval stood up again and read the American reply, which was only received this morning. The American reply stated that US Treasury Secretary Mellon is currently traveling in Europe. Mr. Mellon and the US Ambassador to France, Edge, are deeply aware of the intentions of the US government and are willing to exchange opinions with the French government on the spot. By the time the reply was read, the whole parliament still did not show an excited attitude, and Laval quietly stepped down amid widespread hissing. The parliament then temporarily adjourned to allow members of various factions time to consider what the Prime Minister had announced. Later, extremist member Magain began to debate. Magain used impassioned words to denounce the United States' interference in European affairs, saying that European affairs can be taken care of by European countries and do not require the United States to overstep its bounds. Next, Macklin, a well-known debater from the Nationalist Party, gave a speech. Macklin fiercely criticized the Laval government's weakness, incompetence, and lack of patriotism. The speech was endless for two hours and constantly blamed Germany and the United States. (The following is a Reuters dispatch) Macklin said that President Hoover's proposal only benefits the United States and Germany. The United States intends to sacrifice 6,000,000,000 francs, but US investment in Germany has reached 250,000,000,000 francs. Germany can avoid paying 10,500,000,000 francs because of this proposal. The most affected by the implementation of President Hoover's proposal are France and Belgium. The huge amount now requested for France to sacrifice is approximately between 2,000,000,000 and 2,500,000,000 francs. Furthermore, if the parliament does not declare that Germany's unconditional payments must not be changed, the Young Plan will become a dead letter. (The following is a National News Agency dispatch) After Macklin finished speaking, Treasury Minister Flandin immediately stood up to explain the French counter-proposal and defended that the Young Plan was not canceled in the US President's opinion, and the discussion with US Treasury Secretary Mellon did not mention the shaking of the Young Plan. Flandin also said that France has the necessity to sacrifice, but the United States must also be prepared to sacrifice. Flandin also stated that no matter how difficult the economic situation in Germany is, there is always a way and ability to pay the unconditional annuity. Because Germany recently announced an emergency order and opened up a new source of revenue. The debate extended to midnight and had not yet ended, and the words of all parties were too urgent to choose, and many used abuse as a means. Foreign Minister Briand and Treasury Minister Flandin also occasionally stood up to take responsibility for mediation. The agreement or disagreement of both parties cannot be determined until dawn.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th - The House of Representatives was still meeting at 2:30 this morning, wanting to complete the debate on the French reply as soon as possible so that the government could begin negotiations with US Treasury Secretary Mellon. The French Treasury Minister said that a few days before President Hoover's proposal, Germany had formally announced its intention to request a suspension of payments under the Young Plan. If the plan proposed by the US President is implemented, France will sacrifice 1,600,000,000 francs, but if payments under the Young Plan are suspended, France must have a guarantee of 500,000,000 marks so that France can reduce its sacrifices under the Hoover Plan. What the parliament should express its opinion on now is not Hoover's proposal, but France's answer. France should choose to use the Hoover plan modified by the French answer, or it should choose the Young Plan. This is the question.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th - The French House of Representatives approved the policy expressed by the French government in its reply to President Hoover's proposal with 389 votes to 189 votes. The House of Representatives also passed a new border defense expenditure of 2,400,000,000 francs. It has been found that the total expenditure approved by the Congress has reached 3,825,000,000 francs.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 27th - When the House of Representatives held an all-night meeting to discuss President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts for one year, the fate of the cabinet hung in the balance. Herriot, McLaine, and Boylon represented most of the members and attacked the government's reply. Premier Laval was quite able to cope with the situation. Fortunately, the entire Socialist Party supported the government, which resulted in the government getting a hundred more votes, which was unexpected. The Socialist Party's support for the reply was due to its benefit to international goodwill.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Brussels, 26th - Belgium's reply to the United States will be telegraphed to Washington on Monday. The Associated Press learned from reliable sources that although Belgium will make major concessions, it is unwilling to sacrifice all reparations. It will insist on excluding the 20 million mark annuity for redeeming the mark notes issued in Belgium during the war. As for the content of the reply, it will be published here once it is telegraphed to Washington.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 26th - The French government gazette stated that negotiations between the United States and France regarding President Hoover's proposal to suspend payments will begin at 3 pm tomorrow. At that time, the French Prime Minister will meet with US Treasury Secretary Mellon and US Ambassador to France Edge in his office, and the French Foreign and Treasury Ministers will also attend the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Received Important Foreign Telegrams <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency, Paris, 26th - France's reply to the US President's proposal to suspend war debts for one year was officially published here today. The full text is five pages long. It first expresses sincere agreement with President Hoover's enthusiasm for initiating this proposal. Second, it calls attention to the sacrifices that France will suffer. Then, it states that although the French government is aware of the magnitude of the sacrifices, it is still prepared to ask the parliament to suspend the collection of German reparations for one year. However, if unconditional reparations are also suspended, it will seriously shake the world's confidence in the Young Plan and the danger is very great. Therefore, it is believed that this unconditional reparation should still be deposited in the International Clearing Bank as a loan to Germany. Furthermore, there are still reservations. Germany should continue to pay the goods that the Young Plan stipulates should be paid, etc. After this article was published, purchases on the Paris Stock Exchange today were very enthusiastic, and prices soared, setting a new record in recent months. Various industrial stocks and credit-worthy bonds were particularly active. The stock of the Bank of France closed at 16,700 francs per share on Thursday and rose to 17,700 francs today.

<p>Convenes a Dinner for Generals to Instruct on Strategy</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication, After Chairman Jiang arrived in Jiangxi, he planned military operations to suppress the Communists and gave instructions to the generals in person. Most of them will be ready. The important commanders for suppressing the Communists have also been properly assigned and were officially announced yesterday, namely: He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Communist Forward Army and Commander-in-Chief of the Left Wing Group Army, Chen Mingshu as the Commander-in-Chief of the Right Wing Group Army, Jiang Guangnai as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, Sun Lianzhong as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army Group, Zhu Shaoliang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Group, Chen Cheng and Zhao Guanwan as Commanders of the First and Second Route Armies, Jiang Dingwen as the Commander of the General Reserve Team of the Anti-Communist Army, Zhao Guantao, Wei Lihuang, Hao Mengling, Li Yunjie, Gao Shuxun, and Tan Daoyuan are all army commanders. The above-mentioned people have also taken office one after another.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang deeply mourned the death of Hu Zuyu, the commander of the Fifth Division, who took the lead in the battle of Guangchang and sacrificed himself for the country. After arriving in the province yesterday, he immediately instructed his adjutant, He Jingwu, to make elegiac couplets and wreaths and send them to Hu's spirit in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Yuzhang Park for proper arrangement. Then, this morning (26th) at about 5 o'clock, accompanied by Minister He and Chairman Lu, he took a car to pay tribute. Military police were densely deployed along the way, and security was strict. After Jiang arrived at the park, he was received by Hu's family. At that time, Sun and Chen, the commanders-in-chief of the two army groups, Chen, the army commander, and the division commanders Tan and Han Guan had all arrived earlier. After a short break, Jiang led the generals to pay tribute. After the ceremony, he stroked the coffin and cried loudly, and comforted Hu's orphans and his family. Then, he led He, Lu, and others to drive to the Martyrs' Cemetery outside the Desheng Gate in Beitan to pay tribute, because this is where the remains of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Nanchang during the Northern Expedition are located. Jiang was also supervising the troops in Jiangxi. Chairman Jiang offered wreaths and saluted as usual, and then went to the rear hospital of the First Middle School and Second Academy of Linggong Temple to comfort the wounded soldiers, instructing them to rest in peace and quiet, and there were also rewards. The officers and soldiers were extremely grateful. Finally, Jiang went to Qingyunpu on the Nanzhang Highway to tour the scenic spots. After arriving at Qingyun, the abbot of the temple came out to receive him, and he slightly ate tea and snacks. He also went to the cemetery of the soldiers who died in the Northern Expedition Army a mile from Qingyun to pay tribute. After the ceremony, he returned to the province in the same car and still went to the Nanchang Airfield to inspect and review the air force. Jiang was quite satisfied with the layout of the airfield. After the review, he went to the General Headquarters. This afternoon (26th) at 4 o'clock, Chairman Jiang convened the generals to the headquarters for dinner and discussed the battle plan. He Yingqin, Chen Mingshu, Zhu Shaoliang, Sun Lianzhong, Li Diping, Chen Cheng, Zhao Guantao, Wei Lihuang, Shangguan Yunxiang, Tan Daoyuan, Li Yunjie, Han Deqin, and Guan Shuren attended. Jiang gave very detailed instructions on the plan to suppress the bandits, and the meeting ended happily at about 6 o'clock. It is heard that the generals will go to the front lines during the day to launch a major campaign to suppress the bandits. (June 26)</p>

<p>A Large Number of Human Bones Discovered on the 23rd</p>
<p>Guo Jingluan Cables Nanjing Urging Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: On the 24th, Mrs. Cai Gongshi, together with the Preparatory Committee for Commemorating the May 3rd Martyrs, excavated the backyard of the former Diplomatic Office to search for Cai Gongshi's remains. No results were obtained that day. Yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, the excavation continued, but still without success. Mrs. Cai was quite hopeless and planned to take a car back to Nanjing, but she missed the train and returned to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. At 5:00 PM, about five feet north of the south wall of the excavation garden, a large number of human bones were discovered as soon as they entered the ground. A worker, Han Chunru, took the bones to Mrs. Cai. Mrs. Cai wept bitterly and immediately took a car to the site to inspect. The excavated bones included finger bones, ribs, wrist bones, limb bones, and part of the pelvic bone. The bones were all charred, indicating that they had been burned and buried by the Japanese. There were also clothes, shrapnel, belts, bayonets, and military maps (the maps showed the route from Tai'an to Dongchang), proving that they were undoubtedly the martyrs who died in the May 3rd Incident. However, it was too late to determine which ones belonged to Cai Gongshi. Mrs. Cai is now planning to purchase a very expensive coffin for the burial and is also taking photos to preserve the actual situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday (the 25th) evening, Mrs. Cai telegraphed President Chiang of the National Government and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report and request instructions on how to handle the aftermath and to urge the Japanese side to start negotiations as soon as possible. The telegram read: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing: The remains of the martyrs who died in the May 3rd Incident were burned by the Japanese army and buried under the wall of the backyard of the former Diplomatic Office. At 4:00 PM today, many half-burned skulls, limb bones, toes, flesh, and items such as clothing, shoe soles, and leather bags were excavated. One box has been collected and temporarily stored in the office. Please provide instructions on how to handle this matter and urge the Japanese side to start negotiations as soon as possible. Guo Jingluan respectfully requests." The telegram to the National Government is omitted. This morning (the 26th) at 7:00 AM, the excavation continued. Guo Jingluan, along with her brother Guo Ruheng, went to the site to inspect. More burned bones and clothes were continuously discovered. The bloodstains were still clearly visible, and many charred pieces of flesh were also found, with a lingering odor. Ms. Guo was moved to tears, and many of the excavation workers were also moved to tears. At 9:00 AM, Guo went to the Provincial Government to visit Chairman Han Fuju to discuss the matter. It is reported that the Provincial Government meeting today has already discussed it.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Case of Japanese Military Officer Assaulting Chinese Police Officer in Tianjin <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Resolved After Sixteen Rounds of Negotiations</p>
<p>Japanese Side Apologizes to Our Side Separately</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: At 11:20 AM on June 2nd, a Japanese military officer riding a bicycle on Haiguang Temple Street in Tianjin injured an elderly woman, Guan Shuangshi. The police officer on duty, Li Degui, saw the incident and immediately went forward to inquire. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military officer not only refused to give his name but also beat the police officer, injuring him. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau was preparing to file a protest and engage in serious negotiations with the Japanese Consul. In the afternoon of the same day, five military police officers from the Japanese Army Headquarters went to the district to demand the assaulted police officer, creating a serious situation. Fearing a conflict, the district immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, which sent Section Chief Shen Dijia, accompanied by Japanese Vice-Consul Goto, to investigate. Section Chief Shen informed them that if there were any issues, they should be handled by the local authorities and the Japanese Consul, and that the military police should not come to the district office on their own, which could cause misunderstandings. The military police then dispersed and requested that the matter not be escalated in the interest of friendship. It was decided that the Bureau would first send someone to negotiate, and if no compromise could be reached, they would then negotiate with the Japanese Consul. On the morning of the 3rd, the Public Security Bureau sent Director Yan to the Japanese Army Headquarters and presented four demands: 1. Apology; 2. Compensation; 3. Punishment of the assailant; 4. Guarantee that such incidents would not happen again. The Army Headquarters claimed that the police officer had obstructed the Japanese military officer's service and knocked down his bicycle, and that the Chinese police officer should be held responsible. All the demands were rejected. In the afternoon, four military police officers, including the head of the military police and a staff officer, came to the Public Security Bureau and stated that they rejected our demands and instead made two demands: 1. Apology; 2. Removal of the police officer on duty. They also forced Section Chief Shen to acknowledge their demands, and their words were very disrespectful. Section Chief Shen sternly rejected them. Considering the attitude of the Japanese Army Headquarters, it was difficult to resolve the matter locally. On the 4th, the Municipal Government sent Section Chief Shen Dijia and Secretary Liu Shaokun to the Japanese Consulate to formally protest, presenting the above four demands and requesting the withdrawal of the demands made by the Army Headquarters. Initially, the Japanese Consul also insisted on the Army Headquarters' opinion. After repeated arguments and sixteen rounds of negotiations, a result was finally achieved. The agreed items were telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval and implemented on June 23rd. The three agreed items are listed below: (1) The medical expenses of the victim will be borne by the assailant. (2) The Japanese infantry commander will meet with the director of the Public Security Bureau at the site of the incident in the Chinese Concession to express his apology for the unfortunate incident and declare that he will pay special attention to cracking down on such incidents in the future. (3) The Japanese Consulate will send someone to the Municipal Government to declare its apology for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident and the injury to the Chinese side, expressing their apology on behalf of international relations. The case has now been resolved, and it is hoped that the friendly relations between the two countries will be further strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>After the above three items were decided, at 9:00 AM this morning (the 23rd), Japanese Consul Honjo, Infantry Commander Sakai, Military Police Commander Moriki, Interpreter Yoshida, and Military Police Special Agent Matsushita went to the site of the incident in the Chinese Concession. They were received by Section Chief Shen Dijia, Secretary Liu Shaokun, the director of the Second District, and the director of the Sixth Precinct. Consul Honjo and Infantry Commander Sakai expressed their apology for the unfortunate incident and declared that they would pay special attention to cracking down on such incidents in the future. Section Chief Shen expressed his acceptance and considered it satisfactory, and they shook hands and dispersed. At 2:30 PM, the Japanese Consulate sent Consul Honjo and Vice-Consul Goto to the Municipal Government. They were received by Secretary-General Zou, Section Chief Shen, and Secretary Liu. Consul Honjo declared that he apologized for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident and the injury to the Chinese side, expressing his apology on behalf of international relations. The case has now been resolved, and it is hoped that the friendly relations between the two countries will be further strengthened in the future. Secretary-General Zou replied that he was satisfied that they had come to express their apology. Then, they each drank champagne, shook hands, and dispersed happily. The medical expenses of the victim were paid in full by Vice-Consul Goto to Section Chief Shen on the 20th for forwarding. At the same time, the Tianjin Public Organizations' Foreign Aid Association for the Case of Assaulting Chinese Police Officers announced that it would soon disband because the case had been satisfactorily resolved and the goal of punishing the assailant and obtaining an apology had been achieved.

<p>Li Mingzhong and Fang Benren Also Headed to Jiangxi</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Command Post, believes that since Commander-in-Chief Chiang has arrived in Jiangxi, it is urgent to go to Jiangxi to seek instructions on the plan for suppressing the communists in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces in order to unify military operations. According to Chen Guangzu, Chief of Staff of the Command Post, He has decided to go to Jiangxi, but the departure date has not been set, and he is expected to depart within three to five days. In addition, Li Mingzhong, Pacification Commissioner of the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Border Area, also went south from Xinyang on the evening of the 25th to seek instructions on important matters, arriving in Hankou on the morning of the 26th. Chief of Staff Zheng Dazhang, Chief of the General Staff Xu Tingji, Director of the Secretariat Ma Xianyang, and Director of the Beijing Office Wang Cibo accompanied him. After arriving in Hankou, Li immediately visited Director He to report on the recent situation of suppressing the communists on the Henan-Hubei border. That evening, he took the Japanese Qing Company's Daifuku Maru to Xunyang and then to Nanchang. Furthermore, Fang Benren, who had previously been summoned by Chiang to Jiangxi to advise on military affairs, was originally scheduled to go east on the 25th, but due to private matters that needed to be dealt with, he changed his departure to the 27th. Xie Bin, the new commander of the 10th Division, also went with him. (June 26th)</p>

<p>Guangdong and Guangxi Troops Have Not Invaded Hunan</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, has reported the situation of the Guangdong and Guangxi troops obtained in Hunan Province to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and notified friendly troops. The original telegram reads: "According to recent reconnaissance reports, various factions in Guangdong and Guangxi are engaged in fierce secret strife. The situation is as follows: (1) Commander Tao Guangyang telegraphed that according to reconnaissance reports, the Guangdong rebels are focusing on the defense of the Dong River, and the situation on the Bei River is easing. It is rumored that Guangdong is adopting a defensive posture, while Guangxi is adopting an offensive posture. The Guangdong troops stationed at Yuantan and Yingde along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway have not shown any signs of departure and are currently focusing on the West River and Xiaobei River, seemingly monitoring the actions of Zhang's and Gui's troops. Yu Hanmou's troops stationed in Shaoguan are moving towards Nanxiong to prevent the Jiangxi bandits from taking the opportunity to flee to Guangdong. Various new and old factions in Guangdong are engaged in fierce secret strife. Recently, due to difficulties in recruiting soldiers, they have adopted a forced conscription system and forcibly collected 20 million in rent, causing merchants and residents to flee. It is reported that a portion of the Guangdong troops oppose the puppet government and that the Guangxi troops will send troops to Guangdong to suppress them. Six more steamers have arrived in Pingle, and the troops stationed in Pingle are preparing to move out, intending to attack Guangdong. (2) Commander Tao Guangjing telegraphed that Zhang's and Gui's troops have other intentions in entering Guangdong. Most of the Guangdong troops on the Bei River have also withdrawn to Guangzhou. There are currently no heavy troops stationed on the Guangdong-Guangxi border adjacent to the counties in southern Hunan. (3) Yi Zhang County Chief Liao Bingwen telegraphed that since Chen Mingshu issued a warning telegram to Wang Jingwei, the rebel troops in Guangdong have been extremely panicked and have dispatched Li Yangjing's troops to deploy defenses in Nanxiong and Shixing. (4) Lingling County Chief Hu Tianxiang telegraphed that according to reconnaissance reports, there are no large rebel troops in Guilin, only two local militias are building forts and trenches. About 3,000 rebel troops of Zhang and Gui are stationed at Longhuguan in Pingle, appearing and disappearing, claiming to be searching and suppressing, but have not entered Hunan. About 500 to 600 Guangxi troops at Huangsha River also claim to be defending against bandits and have not entered Hunan. The troops of Ping Gong stationed in Pingle seem to be planning to attack Guangdong and have no intention of invading Hunan. The above four items are specially reported. He Jian respectfully bows." According to the above situation, the troops in Hunan are still actively suppressing the communists in their original locations. The current situation is gradually easing and does not seem as tense as before. (June 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Ruling on the Jinan Telephone Company Lawsuit <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Court Rejects Japanese Application</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In the case of debt disputes between the Japanese East Asia Development Company and the Jinan Telephone Company, the Jinan District Court previously ordered the Telephone Company to repay the Japanese company 420,000 Japanese yen. The Telephone Company refused to accept the judgment and appealed. The East Asia Development Company also applied for a preliminary attachment on the assets of the Telephone Company. The Shandong High Court has now ruled that the Telephone Company is not responsible for repaying the debt and rejected the East Asia Development Company's application for a preliminary attachment. The Shandong High Court's ruling on the East Asia Development Company's application for a preliminary attachment is recorded below. Shandong High Court Civil Ruling, 20th Year, Complaint No. 245. Ruling Transcript: Applicant, Masakawa Kagawa; Agent, Shin Yoshida. The above applicant and the Jinan Telephone Company are involved in a lawsuit regarding guarantee debt. The court rules as follows on the application for preliminary attachment: "Ruling:" The application is rejected. The application fees shall be borne by the applicant. "Reasons:" According to the provisions of Article 627, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Procedure Law, a preliminary attachment may be applied for to preserve compulsory execution in cases of claims other than claims for money. According to this provision, the subject matter of the claim requested by the parties must be a non-monetary payment in order to apply for a preliminary attachment. This is very clear. In this case, the applicant and the Jinan Telephone Company are involved in a lawsuit regarding guarantee debt. The applicant is requesting that the Telephone Company be jointly and severally liable for repaying the guarantee debt. As for the various assets of the company listed in the application for preliminary attachment, they are not within the scope of the subject matter of the claim in this case. Since the subject matter of the applicant's claim in this case is a claim for money and not a claim for non-monetary payment, the application for preliminary attachment is legally inadmissible. Based on the above conclusion, the application in this case should be deemed illegal. According to Articles 118 and 97 of the same regulation, this ruling is specially made as stated in the main text. Presiding Judge of the Second Civil Division of the Shandong High Court, Yu Jianshu; Judge Yi Xin; Judge Ding Yikui. (June 25th)</p>

<p>Shenyang Dispatch: French aviator Cibu, accompanied by his wife and technician Dame, arrived in Shenyang at 12:00 noon on the 24th in a Renault monoplane and landed at the northeast airfield of the Aviation Army. At that time, French Consul Ge Libang in Shenyang greeted them at the scene. The Aviation Headquarters, the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, and the Shenyang Customs Superintendent's Office also sent personnel to the scene to conduct an inspection and found no prohibited items. Then, the Asia Petroleum Company prepared a heavy truck and loaded thirty barrels of gasoline into the plane. After that, Cibu, his wife, and Dame went to the Yamato Hotel to rest. They are scheduled to fly to Beiping this morning. The plane's load capacity is 2,200 kilograms, its horsepower is 3,000, its capacity is 5 people, and its speed is 240 kilometers per hour. The front of the plane has the national emblems of eleven countries that it has traveled to, the earliest being in 1928. The Northeast Aviation Headquarters also marked a badge on it as a memento. It is reported that Mr. and Mrs. Cibu's trip to China is of a recreational nature. They departed from Paris, the French capital, on the 16th of the month. After landing in Moscow for one day, they were delayed due to strong winds in the White Sea area within the Russian flight line. When flying over Zhazalanor, they planned to fly to the Xing'an area, but turned back midway due to bad weather and flew to Manzhouli. Because the Manzhouli airfield was too small, they did not land and continued to fly to Harbin. However, the airfield there was inconvenient due to the presence of railway lines and crops on all sides, so they did not land there either. They specially flew to Shenyang at 7:30 AM on the 24th and plan to determine their itinerary after arriving in Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai. They plan to stay in Beiping for a month.

<h3 id="e85">Citizens of Qingpu County Petition to Prohibit Mining on Jiufeng Mountain <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Eleven citizens of Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province, including Ni Zhu-hua, He Pei-cang, Qian Yang-qiao, Ni Chang-geng, and He Wei-qin, petitioned to prohibit mining on Jiufeng Mountain. The petition stated: "Petition for the sake of the scenic Jiufeng Mountain, requesting a strict order to prohibit stone quarrying to preserve historical sites and maintain public safety. The Jiufeng Mountains are located between Qingpu and Songjiang. Sheshan, Xueshan, Chenshan, Fenghuangshan, and Kugongshan belong to Qingpu County, while Hengshan, Jishan, Xiaokunshan, and Tianmashan belong to Songjiang County. There are countless tombs of local worthies, ancestral shrines of famous officials, and records of these in the Qingpu and Songjiang County Chronicles since the Tang and Song dynasties. As for the graves of the common people, they are built along the mountains. Everywhere you look, they regard this as a sacred place. For generations, they have all regarded it as a scenic spot. Since the Republic of China, some locals have coveted the mountain stones and secretly obtained mining permits. Although the people of Qingpu and Songjiang have petitioned to prohibit this, one after another, they are digging graves and quarrying stones. Chenshan and Hengshan started first, followed by Xueshan, and then Tianmashan and East Sheshan. It is said that the other mountains, such as Fenghuangshan, Xiaokunshan, Kugongshan, and Jishan, will also be opened for mining. The local villagers are shocked and dare not say anything. The local officials turn a blind eye and conceal the matter, resulting in stone quarries opening in competition, like swarms of bees rising up. If they are allowed to run rampant, the scenic Jiufeng Mountain will inevitably be exhausted by quarrying. Not only will the residents of Qingpu and Songjiang lack a place to mourn and游览, but the millions of people gathered in Shanghai will also suddenly lose a place to enjoy the scenery, relax, and nourish their spirits. The petitioners, Zhu-hua and others, for the sake of the scenic Jiufeng Mountain and for the sake of local public safety, must point out the most obvious harms and report them to your department for your detailed consideration: (1) The Jiufeng Mountains are located in Qingpu and Songjiang, adjacent to Shanghai, and are a place for the people of Songjiang and Shanghai to relax and游览. In the future, when the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's Great Shanghai Plan is realized and the population of Shanghai becomes even denser, the beauty of the mountains and rivers will be even more necessary for tourists to rest. Looking around the civilized countries of the modern world, the opening of parks and the embellishment of mountains and rivers cost millions upon millions each year. Officials are appointed to manage them in order to cultivate the people's character, strengthen their bodies, and achieve their plans to protect the country and strengthen the race. This is common everywhere. However, Shanghai, where millions of people gather, lacks the beauty of parks and the splendor of mountains and rivers. Those with knowledge consider this a regret. Therefore, these only remaining Jiufeng Mountains are not cherished and are allowed to be destroyed by others. Although quarrying stones can generate profits for a time, the destruction of scenic spots, which are used to comfort the mind and body, will erode along with it. The price is not comparable to the mere material benefits. For the sake of the physical and mental cultivation of the majority of the people, we must strongly request preservation. (2) The ancient sites of the Jiufeng Mountains, recorded in the chronicles, all have historical significance, such as the tombs of local worthies, ancestral shrines of famous officials, steles, and memorial arches, which are as precious as the monuments, towers, and bronze statues of Europe and America. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior promulgated the Regulations on the Preservation of Scenic Spots, Historical Sites, and Cultural Relics in September of the 17th year of the Republic of China, stipulating in Articles 2 and 8 that protection should be spared no effort. Once the mountains are opened for stone quarrying, the historical sites will inevitably be destroyed. For the sake of future generations to admire the sages and for the sake of historical research, we must strongly request preservation. (3) There are no less than hundreds of thousands of people's graves in the Jiufeng Mountains. Every year, the descendants sweep the graves, following the tradition. Once they are destroyed and dug up, not only will the corpses be exposed, causing the dead to hate in the underworld, but the living will weep blood and break their hearts, causing unbearable pain. Who has no parents? Who is not a descendant? Even if they are not the descendants of the hundreds of thousands of grave owners in the mountains, who can bear to see this cruelty? Filial piety is our country's inherent morality. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen, in his sixth lecture on nationalism, strongly advocated preservation, saying, "If we can explain the meaning of filial piety to the extreme, the country can naturally become strong." For the sake of maintaining the hard work of the philosophers who have governed the world with filial piety for thousands of years, we must strongly request preservation. (4) Stone quarries are everywhere, with hundreds of small workers in each factory and thousands in ten factories. These workers are of mixed quality, leading to rampant thieves in neighboring villages, causing unrest among the people. For the sake of local security, we must strongly request a ban. (5) The irrigation of farmland near the Jiufeng Mountains relies entirely on mountain water. Now, due to the impact of the opening of the mountains, the mountain water sources are being blocked. This not only hinders water conservancy and farmland, but also the dust from crushing and transporting stones will inevitably spread to the nearby fields. As this accumulates over time, the soil will become solid, and good farmland will turn into stony fields. The fertile land around Jiufeng is no less than hundreds of thousands of acres. In the future, the reduction of agricultural products is inevitable. For the sake of the people's livelihood and national taxes, we must strongly request a ban. In summary, the five harms mentioned above may be difficult for your department to hear about due to the hard work of construction, but the petitioners have witnessed the situation firsthand and dare not suppress the facts. Therefore, we dare to enumerate the harms and respectfully request your department to take into consideration the scenic Jiufeng Mountain and quickly prohibit stone quarrying. All stone quarries should be closed immediately. If there are any who disobey the orders overtly but comply secretly, the people should be allowed to report them, and they should be severely punished according to the law, so as to appease the public and eliminate hidden dangers. This is truly a public benefit. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<p>Rural Woman Abused and Commits Suicide by Arson: In Henggang Village, a subordinate area of the county, the daughter-in-law of Zhong Fulan, surnamed Mou, was constantly abused by her husband. She attempted suicide by poisoning several times, but was always discovered and saved. One morning, while the family was working in the fields, she suddenly locked the room door, piled clothes on the bed, poured kerosene, and then lay down in the bed and set it on fire. Instantly, the fire blazed to the sky, making it impossible to approach. Neighbors heard the alarm and rushed to rescue her, but the fire had already broken through the roof. By the time her family received the news and returned, the house had been completely burned down, and the woman's body was charred black. The whole family wept bitterly, a truly tragic scene.</p>
<p>Shameless Adulteress Murders Her Lover: Near Songjia Mound in the Eleventh District, a farmer named Zhang Laosi began living with a widow named Zhu Abao after his wife died. They lived together as husband and wife. Zhu had a daughter whom Zhang's eldest son married, making them relatives. However, Abao was naturally promiscuous and recently found a new lover. She abandoned her old love for the new, completely changing her previous affectionate demeanor. She repeatedly provoked discord between her son-in-law and his father. The other day, Zhang and his son got into a fight, and Abao helped the son, ultimately killing Laosi. Afterwards, she hung the body from a beam, hoping to cover up the crime. Fortunately, Zhang's second son ran to a neighbor for help, who reported it to the Xujing Public Security First Sub-station. The police were dispatched to arrest the murderer and take her into custody for temporary detention. A written report was prepared and submitted to the county government for an on-site investigation. After the investigation, the suspect and the murder weapon were taken to the county for further investigation.</p>

<p>Anti-Banditry Unit Executes Kidnappers: Kidnappers Wang Cihong and Guan Yehua had repeatedly kidnapped an old man from Henggu Township, obtaining 3,400 yuan, and Ma Wenxiang from Xishan, obtaining 4,000 yuan. They also committed robberies in various townships such as Wangjiadang, about ten li southwest of Wujiang Wulu. At the beginning of this month, they went to Nanxun, Zhejiang, to commit robberies. They were captured by the Nanxun Public Security Bureau and the Wuxian Public Security Bureau was notified to send police to escort them back. After a thorough investigation, they were transferred to the Anti-Banditry Command in Suzhou and Zhejiang for disposition. After a thorough review by the military judge, Commander Zhu ordered their execution yesterday (the 27th).

Various industries held a joint meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 27th) to discuss the procedures. As a result, it was decided that for businesses in the urban area that had joined the trade associations, those with a tax rate of two per thousand would pay one quarter of the total amount of 50,000 yuan, which is 12,500 yuan, first. The Chamber of Commerce would notify them to submit the payment to the Collection Bureau by July 1st.

<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Anti-Banditry Commander Inspects Wuxi: The 16th Company of the 4th Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the Provincial Security Team, stationed in Xincang Town, Pinghu County, fled and looted after a mutiny. Zhu Mian, the commander of the Suzhou-Zhejiang Joint Anti-Banditry Command against the bandits in Taihu Lake, had previously telegraphed the police forces of various counties along the lake to jointly suppress the bandits. After receiving the telegram, the Wuxi County Police Team immediately dispatched a team to Wangting and its vicinity to assist in the suppression as circumstances allowed. Commander Zhu, considering the rampant banditry in the lake area, urgently needed to be suppressed as soon as possible, came to Wuxi from Suzhou yesterday to conduct a detailed inspection of the County Police Team. He had a thorough discussion with Captain Wang regarding the cooperative suppression steps and the planned progress in this area. He then discussed the matter at length with County Magistrate Pan and Shen, the District Chief of the Second Water Police District. He then returned to Suzhou, and District Chief Shen also went to Suzhou in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Request to Abolish Special Tax on Water Pumps: The 17 autonomous district public offices in Wuxi County have been unable to secure funds since the abolition of the cocoon tax, which previously included an autonomous fee. They jointly decided to levy a special tax on water pumps used for irrigation in various townships, one yuan per machine per month, to make up for the shortfall. This has been submitted to the county government and then to the provincial government for discussion at the provincial administrative meeting. Upon hearing this news, the Water Pump Industry Association believed that water pumps were the only agricultural tool for farmers to cultivate their land, which could increase agricultural production, and that it would be difficult to collect a special tax. They submitted a separate petition to the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, requesting an exemption from the tax to show compassion. Yesterday, they received a reply from the provincial government, ordering the county government to investigate and review the matter.</p>
<p>Various Recent Rumors About the Opium Monopoly: After the opium monopoly was established, the sales quota for Wuxi was initially 25,000 taels per month. Many people were vying for the position of Director of the Inspection and Suppression Office. However, the monthly sales quota was soon changed to 50,000 taels, causing many people to withdraw. Director Feng, believing that Wuxi was a well-known and desirable position in Suzhou and Changzhou, wondered why no one was interested. After investigating the situation, he reduced the quota to 40,000 taels per month and appointed Wang Zhiliang as the director of the Wuxi branch. Wang, also known as Wang Jiyu, is from Suzhou and currently serves as a staff officer in the Wusong Fortress Command. It is also said that Guo Cifen has been appointed in Wujin, Jiang Xiaodi in Suzhou, Yu Gongcai in Changshu, and Lei Chunsheng in Wujiang.</p>
<p>Middle School Student Drowns While Swimming: Wei Zulie, a student at the private Wuxi Middle School outside the South Gate at Yangyao Bay (18 years old, from Yancheng), went swimming in the Lengdugang River at Yangyao Bay with three or four classmates yesterday (the 27th) at around 1 PM and sank to the bottom of the water. He was rescued by his companions, but his breath was barely sustained. They immediately called Dr. Zhu from the Brothers Hospital for emergency treatment, but it was too late and he died. His father, Wei Ruisheng, works at the Tongren Stack in Maoyingbang outside the North Gate. Upon receiving the news, he rushed to the scene, embraced the body and wept bitterly, making arrangements for the funeral. It was a truly tragic scene.</p>

<p>County Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Designated: The Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the county party headquarters have been selected from a doubled list of candidates by the Sixth County Representative Congress and submitted to the province for approval.

<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Arson in the Night After Failed Strong-Arm Loan: Wu Linbao, a resident near Xiaoxin Bridge in the Fourth District of Wuyi, has three sons. The youngest son, Wu Dada, forcefully demanded silver dollars from his father the other night, and then forcefully borrowed from his older brother. Both requests were denied. He then set fire to a room in the house while the family was asleep late at night, and also smashed two other rooms. Neighbors rescued the situation and prevented a major disaster. After this incident, Dada was arrested and sent to the nearby police station by Township Deputy Ma Gangjun. On the 26th, the witness was sent to the city for questioning by the county.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Cables Acceptance of Business Tax: The Provincial Government of Wuyi County has set a deadline for the collection of business tax within this month. Commissioner Zhang Baozhen, who was sent back to the province to report, said that the county's business tax issue had not been resolved. Upon hearing this news, the County Chamber of Commerce sent a cable to the county government on the 26th, stating that the Chamber of Commerce had repeatedly convened meetings of various industries to discuss the method of accepting and paying the business tax. The final result was that 32 industries agreed to pay a total of 24,000 yuan annually. There were still a few industries that requested reductions or exemptions, which should be resolved separately. Commissioner Zhang's report stated that no solution had been found, which was incomprehensible. The declaration forms for various industries, including the timber industry, money industry, homespun industry, and food industry, have not yet been submitted. These industries have either submitted petitions for reductions or exemptions, or claimed tax exemptions, and have requested a temporary delay in submission, but it is not a deliberate delay.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Gang Members Plan Revenge After Bandit Execution: Zheng Yushan and four other major bandits who roamed the northwestern townships of this county, kidnapping and extorting ransoms, were arrested and executed on the 24th of this month. News of this reached Wangshi Town, where it was said that Zheng Yushan's son, Zheng Ming, was planning revenge. He led several bandit ships, with about 50 or 60 bandits, intending to target various ports in Jiangnan. The bandit ships were anchored near Niuhongjiang on the opposite bank. At the same time, residents along the river reported to the Tushi Water Patrol Team that several suspicious ships were spotted on the Tiehuangsha shoal of the Yangtze River this afternoon (the 26th). They carried seven or eight quick-firing guns and six or seven box cannons, as seen by fishermen going to the river to fish. As a result, the residents were extremely panicked. The Water Patrol Team has appointed patrol officer Cai Jinrong to inspect various sea ports in Gengjing and deployed defenses at various ports to prepare for any eventuality.</p>

The news was reported to the garrison provincial army at Hupukou, the Fifth Sub-station of the Sixth Branch Bureau, and the Police Brigade. A platoon of soldiers led by platoon leader Xi Junfu of the garrison army went to Gaopukou and immediately encountered gunfire from the bandits. After about an hour, the bandits gradually became unsustainable, and more than ten of them carried weapons and landed ashore, disappearing. The soldiers and police also landed and ambushed, intending to capture the bandits when they returned to the ship. About two hours later, another bandit ship arrived and shone a flashlight, spotting the ambush. They exchanged gunfire again, and the bandits abandoned the ship and fled.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Resolution of Rickshaw Fee Dispute: The dispute over rickshaw fees in Nantong, which has lasted for more than three months, resulted in a strike and riot by rickshaw pullers on the 25th.

Overdue fees must be paid within half a month, and the arrested rickshaw puller representatives were released by the county government. On the 26th, the rickshaw pullers fully resumed work and paid the fees and obtained licenses as required. Relief for County's Shortfall of Funds: The collection of local donations and taxes in Nantong is sluggish, and the funding for political and police affairs is heavily in arrears. In addition to borrowing 35,000 yuan from the financial sector for emergency relief, the fund production office has applied to the provincial and county governments to borrow 30,000 yuan from various sectors for six months to provide relief.</p>
<p>Wang Boqun and His Wife Visit Nantong: Minister of Communications Wang Boqun, along with his wife, Ms. Bao Zhining, arrived in Nantong by boat on the 28th to celebrate the birthday of the Bao family. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 29th and then proceed to Nanjing.</p>

<p>Funing</p>
<p>Inspection Team Painfully Suppresses Bandit Gang: Bandit leader Shi Baotian, from Dongkan Beixiang, led a gang of more than a hundred people, occupying the area around Shitao Qinyuzhuang, looting and burning, which was heard of every day. They often burned and killed entire families, and the people were disturbed by them, hating them to the bone. The local people repeatedly petitioned the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs to send troops to suppress them. Recently, Police Brigade Commander Xiong Yanghe was ordered to eliminate them within a specified time limit. He immediately ordered the second company commander, Huang Gongzheng, and the third company commander, Sun Zhichong, to lead their troops to encircle and suppress the bandits in Jiadi, Chongjiazhuang, Qinyuzhuang, and Jiepai on the dawn of the 20th. After five hours of fierce fighting with the bandits, the bandits could not withstand the pressure and fled in the northwest direction. On the spot, they killed bandit leaders Chong Yuanlin, and bandits Zhou Xiaoming, Zhu Yongfa, Wang Chaoji, Chen Hongfa, Zhou Xiaogeng, Liu Zhaorong, Dai Guishan, Zhang Kaiyong, Yao Daan, and Zhang Guofu, totaling eleven people. They seized several guns, rescued a kidnapped young woman named Sun Li, and her family reclaimed her. They arrested Wang Jinfen, who harbored the bandits, and presented him to the county government for interrogation. The second company is temporarily stationed in Qitao, and the third company has returned to Dongkan to continue the suppression and arrest operations.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs Near Port: The port area of Changxing, Huzhou, has always been a place where bandits come and go. Kidnapping and looting have often been heard of. Since the 5th Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Security Team was stationed there in the winter of last year, the banditry has decreased slightly. On the 10th of this month, the company was ordered to transfer elsewhere. Bandits hiding in the area took the opportunity to rise up again, causing unbearable disturbance. At about 9 PM on the 24th, more than ten bandits, each carrying a wooden shell gun, kidnapped Chen Shengfa, a resident of Chenjia Village near the area.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Change of Principal at Fourth Middle School: Li Naiji, the principal of Fourth Middle School, has served as principal for five years and achieved good results.

<p>Yongpu Ship Robbed in Xunjiansi Waters: The Yongpu ship, which operates between Shipu in Xiangshan County and Haiyou in Tai County, sailed from Shipu to Haiyou on the lower ninth day of this month and returned to Shipu on the same day. Unexpectedly, two or thirty bandits, dressed in uniforms and posing as military police, mingled among them. The ship's police and crew did not pay attention to them at first, thinking they were military police being transferred. When the ship reached the Xunjiansi waters, the bandit leader gave a signal to carry out the robbery. They first confiscated the ship's police's guns and locked them in the cabin, preventing them from making a sound. Then, they sent bandits to the steering house with the ship's police's guns to monitor the captain, ordering him to sail east. Then, they carried out a large-scale search, and no one on the ship was spared. It is estimated that several hundred yuan in cash and coins were robbed from the accounting room, and the gold and silver ornaments, clothes, and goods of the passengers were robbed for no less than ten thousand yuan. After searching for four days, the captain begged them to release the ship on the 22nd. Before leaving, they kidnapped more than ten passengers. After the ship arrived in Shipu, it has reported to the county government for the military and police to rescue.</p>

The bureau submitted it to the department for re-inspection on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Aircraft Measurement of Qiantang River Work: Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, due to the Qiantang River not being dredged for many years, has been dispatching aircraft measurement teams to start surveying for days. On the one hand, they are excavating ground pools in the Jiangjiang area of Toupengdong Longxing Pagoda to make marks. They are also digging up rice seedlings on the cotton fields and building three rectangular ground pools about two feet deep, each covering about one mu of cotton land, to be used as marks.</p>
<p>Strange Sheep Born in Nansha: Zhang Mingqing, a farmer in Xiaosibu, Nansha, has a ewe that gave birth to a lamb on the 20th. It is neither a sheep nor a human. It is more than a foot long, has two legs, a human face, no hands on the upper body, ears like a human, and white fur all over its body. It sits and stands lively. Zhang Zhaofa from Xiaosibu spent twelve yuan to buy the sheep in order to display it in major ports in Shanghai and Hangzhou for public exhibition.</p>
<p>Anqing</p>
<p>Large-Scale Removal and Punishment of County Magistrates and Bureau Chiefs: At the 139th meeting of the Provincial Government on the 26th, the following records of the removal and punishment of county magistrates and bureau chiefs were approved: (1) The Department of Civil Affairs proposed that Wang Xinlan, the county magistrate of Sixian County, be removed from office and investigated.

It was decided that Zhang Jiakun, the county magistrate of Shouxian County, be removed from office for poor handling. Yu Zhoujie, the county magistrate of Fengtai County, ignored the provincial order and incited turmoil, and was removed from office and investigated. Cheng Guxuan, the director of the Fengtai Public Security Bureau, led a crowd to make unreasonable demands and insulted public officials, and was immediately removed from office, escorted to the province, and handed over to the court for punishment.</p>

Among those who attended the ceremony were Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Jiaotong University President Li Zhaoshi, Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and Shanghai Public Concession Works Bureau Director-General Mike Naughten.</p>
<p>Acting President Shen Siliang reported on the school's affairs for the past year, saying, "Today, our school is holding its 52nd graduation ceremony. On behalf of the president, the board of directors, and the faculty and staff of the university and its affiliated middle school, I welcome you to attend this ceremony. President Bu Gong returned to China early due to his wife's illness and could not attend, and he specifically asked me to convey his apologies. In the past year, everything here has been going very smoothly. Student life has been rich and interesting. Whether in academics or sports, there has been a vibrant atmosphere. The various competitions have been enthusiastic and increasing, which can be used as proof. The number of students this year, including the university and the affiliated middle school, is 602, an increase of 30 compared to last year. The breakdown is as follows: 2 in the graduate school, 1 in the theological seminary, 27 in the medical school, 170 in the liberal arts and sciences college, and 202 in the affiliated middle school, for a total of 602. In terms of faculty and staff, it is roughly the same as in the past. Professor Lei Mu, who has a doctorate, served for six months. Professor Ili of the Civil Engineering College took leave during the second semester and returned home. Mr. Wu Fu'an, a graduate of Yale University, came here to teach history and geography. Dr. Ma Lishi returned to the medical school after his leave. Dr. Chen Xixin is a full-time professor at the medical school. After completing her studies, Ms. Mi returned to teach at the affiliated middle school. Ms. Zhong Lai and Dr. Diao Qinghuan also came to the school. Professors De Ai Lian and Wu Dao returned to China last year and will return next semester. Those on leave this year include Professor Luo Daona and his wife, Professors Jin Hanlu and Su Shangji, and Mr. Song Yuese, who is on leave for half a year. Dr. Diao Xinde, the dean of the medical school, and Dr. De Aoge will be replaced by Dr. Mo Yuexi as the dean and Dr. Chen Xixin as the deputy dean next semester. Those returning to the school next semester include Dr. Mi Hengli, who is currently a history professor at the University of Chicago, and Dr. Gutsi, a political science professor at Yulun University, who previously served as a lecturer at our school. Recently, students' interest in science has gradually increased. Next semester, a class of medical students will be added. About 30 people will enter the Civil Engineering College. The number of graduates from the affiliated middle school this year is also the largest. As for the donations of funds and books received by the school from various parties, there are also many. The most important ones are: (1) An anonymous alumnus donated 1,000 yuan for expenses; (2) The library received donations of Chinese books from various parties, totaling 398 types and 4,295 volumes, the most valuable of which are the rare books of the Song and Yuan dynasties donated by Mr. Pan Mingxun. The Tokyo Publishing Association donated 400 books worth 1,500 yuan. The American Church Bookstore donates books worth 1,000 US dollars annually. Other donors include the Shanghai China Science Society, the Beiping Fan Jingsheng Biological Research Institute, the University of Hong Kong, and the Nanjing Central Research Institute; (3) Alumni of American church universities donated 1,000 US dollars; (4) The Luo Family Foundation donated 3,000 yuan for scientific research; (5) The Shanghai Bank donated one free student quota for the 23rd and 24th years. We express our gratitude for all of the above and will always remember your enthusiastic care for our school."</p>
<p>Next, Foreign Minister Wang gave a speech on the opportunities for Chinese youth, quoting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's saying "Do great things, don't be a big official," to encourage the graduating students. He said that St. John's University has been established for 51 years, earlier than the establishment of any science-oriented school in our country. Therefore, St. John's University is the pioneer of promoting new learning in our country. Of the more than 800 graduates, only one-eighth have become officials, which shows that its school-running policy is correct. He also told the graduates that they should not be too optimistic or pessimistic about everything after entering society, but should follow the middle way and serve the society. Finally, Yu Hongjun delivered a speech, and then graduation diplomas and degrees were awarded, including Bachelor of Arts: Chen Qichang, Deng Shuzhao, Xia Chengmin, Hu Yujie, Huang Jiade, Jiang Zhensheng, Guo Jianying, Liu Lishen, Lin Xingchao, Lin Deyuan, Han Lan, Zeng Huale, Zeng Huajun, Zhao Zhen; Bachelor of Economics: Zhang Shuning, Jiang Zifu, Qiaoshu; Bachelor of Political Science: Zhao Xiupeng, Feng Jiangang, Tu Ji, Wan Daqi, Yao Sen, Yu Nongzong; Bachelor of Science: Chen Xiaoren, Cheng Weixin, Xia Chengshi, Xu Renhui, Huang Mingxin, Gui Naizan, Liu Weide, Pan Rusun, Sheng Jin'yan, Xiao Boxuan, Wang Linsheng, Wang Jungang, Wu Jie, Xu Chongen; Bachelor of Chemistry: Gao Weiren; Graduate School: Master of Arts, Luo Mengjialian, etc. The Theological Seminary issued graduation certificates to Xue Pingxi and Qiu Li.</p>

<p>France Has Lost All Hope, Mixed Doubles Begins</p>
<p>London, 26th (Telegraph) — With glittering brilliance, the situation at the Wimbledon tennis tournament became even more tense today. Both men's and women's singles have reached the semi-finals. Five of the final eight players have already secured their semi-final spots. The mixed doubles has begun, and France's Boorotra's sudden departure has caused a stir.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Boorotra Suddenly Returns to France <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>France's last remaining men's singles player, Boorotra, suddenly returned to France on Wednesday, causing surprise and doubt. It is said that he will not return. What is concerning is that Bo and Bowser must team up for doubles today and a military match against Austria's Arns tomorrow. It is rumored that he will withdraw from tennis life. Three days of hard practice may not be true.</p>

<p>The men's singles has entered the semi-final range. Five of the final eight players have already secured their semi-final spots. There are three Americans: Sears, Van Lien, and Wood. England has Bailey and Hughes. The remaining three players still have hope for England: Li against Sato Jiro today, and Austin against Collins of his own country. France only has Boorotra left, who must defeat Austria's Arns.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Van Lien Defeats France's Bowser <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>American Van Lien defeated Bowser (France) in front of thousands of spectators today by a score of 6-2, 1-6, 6-2, 6-1 in the fourth week. The audience was the largest in recent days, with the sun shining brightly and the central group surrounded.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the English, the most regrettable thing was the defeat of Sharp, who had previously shown power, in the fourth week. He met Hughes of his own country. Sharp initially won the first set, and Hughes wavered. Sharp's heavy shots from the baseline in the first set were like a machine. But later, Hughes calmed down and dealt with Sharp, and finally lost by a score of 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3.</p>

<p>American teenager Sears secured a semi-final spot, defeating England's O'Leary by a score of 6-2, 6-0, 6-2. O'Leary was unable to cope with Sears's shots. Sears's cannonball serve in the second set surprised O'Leary, and he only knew when the ball touched his racket. Wood fought hard for four sets to defeat Manfolo by a score of 6-3, 10-12, 10-8, 6-4. Van Lien's victory over Bowser was entirely due to his cannonball serves and heavy forehand shots, which Bowser could not return, and many wild balls led to his defeat. Bowser's backhand shots were very good.</p>

<p>Those without money speak of optimism; the cowardly speak of humanitarianism. Diplomats from weak countries speak of justice. Those who are suppressed and have nowhere to complain speak of the law.</p>
<p>Those who laugh easily have no sympathy; those who cry easily have no courage.</p>
<p>If you don't say something that can excite people in this world, then people will never pay attention to you. Because people in the world will never pay attention to things that have nothing to do with themselves.</p>
<p>A fool's brain can digest philosophy into foolishness, science into superstition, and art into pedantry.</p>
<p>Our ideals are like the ancient Shinto gods, constantly requiring people's sacrifices.</p>
<p>If a person loves education, criminal law, and sports, he can become a completely modern gentleman as long as he has money.</p>
<p>Social problems seem complicated, but in reality, there are only two topics: one is how to make the poor rich, and the other is how to make the rich useful to society.</p>
<p>When you read the biographies of famous people, you must remember that the truth is never worth publishing.</p>
<p>There is only one kind of child in society who doesn't want to eat candy, and that is the apprentice in a candy store. So the angels themselves never hope for happiness to come.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Tan Yunshan Returns from Touring Tibet and India <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM on June 23rd, I accompanied Mr. Huang Jingwan to visit Mr. Tan Yunshan, who had returned from touring Tibet and India. The following is a record of the conversation.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Yunshan previously served as a Chinese professor at the International University founded by the great Indian poet Tagore. In the winter of the 19th year of the Republic, he went to Tibet from Myanmar to investigate the culture and religion of Tibet. On April 1st of this year, he returned to India from Tibet and toured various Buddhist sites and major cities in India, east, west, north, and south, to investigate Buddhist traces. His travel companions included Mr. Liu Xiunan, the principal of the Zunkong Middle School in Shanghai, and the Daojie Master. They visited Bodh Gaya, the place where the Buddha attained enlightenment, Lingjiu Mountain, the place where the Buddhas preached, Nalanda, the place where the Sanzang Master obtained scriptures, Deer Park, the place where the Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma, Kushinagar, the place where the Buddha entered Nirvana, Nampingni, the place where the Buddha was born, and Shravasti, Jeta Grove Anathapindika Park, the place where the World Honored One preached. They investigated the above-mentioned major holy sites and obtained many commemorative items from the Buddhist country. Furthermore, they passed through Delhi, which was once the capital of India, and visited the imperial palace and the new Delhi Parliament, the Governor's Palace, museums, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan met Gandhi in Batoli, West India, and lived with him for several days. Gandhi got up at 4:00 AM every day and walked until 5:30 AM. One morning, Gandhi planned to invite Mr. Tan to go for a walk, but Tan was sleeping soundly, and Gandhi did not wake him up. Later, Gandhi said to Tan, "I have come several times, but you are always asleep." Tan replied, "Why didn't you wake me up?" Gandhi replied, "You worked hard yesterday and should sleep a few more hours." His respect for people's freedom and love was like this.</p>
<p>Gandhi often goes to the countryside and receives enthusiastic cheers from the people. The people raise money and give gifts to Gandhi. Children come to touch his head and feet to express their affection. Gandhi is also gentle like a "lamb." Poor people have no money to buy gifts, so they give him the yarn they spun themselves. His personality has influenced the people of the country like this.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan is from Chaling, Hunan. He recently returned to China and arrived in Shanghai. He will leave for Beijing soon.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Record of the Big Sword Society in Yuxi Bay, Fujian <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Hui</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, the Yihetuan used sorcery to create chaos in the Central Plains, causing resentment among foreigners. They eventually brought about the disaster of the Allied Forces, which led to the almost complete destruction of the capital, the emperor and empress fleeing, paying reparations, and ceding land, leaving our country with great shame in history. The people of the country still mourn it today. The Big Sword Society in Yuxi Bay, Fujian, recently has a technique similar to that of the Yihetuan. I am writing this to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>The Big Sword Society is a group formed by the villagers of Yuxi to defend against bandits. There are many bandits in the upper reaches of Fujian. After the defeat of the rebels, their subordinates had no home to return to, and some returned to their original nature and became bandits again. As a result, the people of northern Fujian were trapped deeper and deeper in the water and fire. Yuxi, which was known for its tranquility, was also ravaged. The villagers suffered from this, so they recruited strong men to form the Big Sword Society for self-defense. The leader of the team is from Jiangxi and has a magical technique that can use spells to defend against guns and cannons. During battle, he swallows several pieces of paper with spells on them and sticks them on his chest. They agree not to open their mouths, otherwise, the spells will not work. When bandits come with guns, they do not move at all. When cannons come, they faint slightly and then recover. Therefore, the bandits are defeated. On weekdays, they live in various places and engage in their own businesses. When the alarm sounds, they gather together. Their weapons are big swords, not guns or cannons. Therefore, they are called the Big Sword Society. The team's discipline is very strict. Those who are addicted to smoking and alcohol are not allowed to join the team. Those who are greedy for money are not allowed to join the team. Those who have been bandits are also not allowed to join the team. I heard this from a guest from Yuxi, so I can say it with certainty.</p>

<p>— Ms. Qiyun</p>
<p>I love reading novels the most. Once I have a book in hand, I forget to sleep and eat. But I think that no matter whether it is a Chinese or foreign novel, it is better to appreciate the twists and turns of the plot than to appreciate the beauty of the writing. Therefore, I dare to say that "The Romance of the Western Chamber" is not as good as "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is not as good as "Water Margin," and even "All Quiet on the Western Front" is not as good as "The Good Earth." "Resurrection" is not as good as "Plum Blossom Falling." Although the criticism from a literary standpoint is not like this, from the standpoint of my reading interest, I always feel that the more twists and turns in the plot, the better.</p>
<p>I once read a novel called "Red Tear Shadow." I felt that its plot was more tortuous than any book I had ever read. It wrote about "a rich young master who fell in love with a poor girl. Because society and the family could not sympathize with their marriage, they had to go to a foreign country and live a secret life. Later, the rich young master inherited the inheritance and returned home. He entrusted the woman to an old woman. At this time, the woman had already given birth to a pearl in her palm, but she died of sorrow and anger. After the rich young master returned, he was almost forced to marry another woman. Unexpectedly, that wife also suddenly died of illness. So he vowed never to marry again. He also went to the old woman to take back his daughter. But the old woman had bad intentions and replaced his daughter with her own daughter, instead treating his daughter as her own. The old woman's daughter was a heartless, extravagant, and promiscuous person, but his own daughter was very quiet and chaste. Therefore, several strange dramas were created. Later, the rich young master wanted to recruit a son-in-law for his daughter. Who knew that the young man did not love his daughter (actually the old woman's daughter) but fell in love with the old woman's daughter (actually the rich young master's true daughter), and a murder almost occurred. Later, the old woman's conscience was discovered, and she revealed the secret. Only then did the truth come out." The twists and turns of its plot, my law is really unable to describe its ten thousandth. I think this novel is really the most beloved by me to read. Now it is said that the Mingxing Film Company has already made it into the "Red Tear Shadow" film. Then, the power of performance on the screen must be much more ingenious than what is described in the book.</p>

<p>19th. Many Muslim professors and students know Persian. Talk to me about Persian affairs. And said that the ancient Persian Manichaeism spread to China. I asked if Manichaeism still exists today. Answered no. According to them, the ancient Muslim king was in trouble with Manichaeism and wrote to China. The Chinese king replied. I am also willing to trouble the Manichaeans. Not allowed in China. I don't know if this is true. It should be between the Tang and Song dynasties. Communication between Persia and China is quite difficult to examine. According to the current location of the Biography of King Mu of Zhou, it is said that King Mu of Zhou traveled west and married the Queen Mother of the West, and the scenery in the Biography of King Mu is now the Persian capital of Isfahan. Jiang Guanyun's Examination of the Chinese Race also said that foreign books said that King Xiang had married the Persian Queen. Originally, the lack of communication between the East and the West was due to the isolation of the Muslim countries. And whether there were two kings marrying in ancient China. Gu Jiang also advocated his theory. I am now asking my Muslim friends who study Persian history. It is also difficult to understand. I intend to ask the Persians.</p>

<p>are shoe merchants. According to them, there are three families in this market. Their whole family has lived here for decades. There are many shoe stores in central India. Because Indians lack this manufacturing. Soon I saw six or seven Chinese people coming here. They said they came from Lucknow. Today is the Lunar New Year's Day. So come and visit. But I see their entertainment life. All are playing cards. Because I think the Chinese people are generally like this everywhere. It is also a major shortcoming of the Chinese people. If you have a little free time, you will exhaust your energy on gambling. What can I do? Because I remembered talking to the highest intellectuals in China. He is the highest person in the education sector. And also loves gambling. Asked me the reason. I can only say it is a habit. Also, a friend of the educator talked about this. They study the principle of gambling. It is also very difficult to cancel. I think this is also a kind of competitive nature. It has become a habit for a long time. Indians love to buy Chinese goods very much. Because it抵 British goods. Especially love Chinese goods. Today is the end of the Muslim fasting period. The streets are full of cars and carriages. Those carrying fresh clothes are all Muslims. A Muslim friend and I walked around the market. Originally this city is extremely clean. Its roads are wide and clean. Like Jiaomin Lane in Beijing. Muslim friends are quite chivalrous. Love sports. When I got to his house. I saw that the room was decorated with antlers and bull ears. But cutting off the deer's head. Connecting the corners and decorating them on the wall made me feel quite uneasy. It's okay to take only the corners. Even its head is not elegant.</p>

<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>West of Lanling, there is the Wangxian Bridge. It is said that Ding Lingwei passed through here when he transformed into a crane and returned. The residents by the bridge have long formed a market. In one of the families, surnamed Zhu, three daughters were born. The eldest was named Ying (Oriole), the second Feng (Phoenix), and the third Yan (Swallow). Ying was married early but was not happy in her husband's family. This was not due to a romantic entanglement like Wang Lang's regret, but because she was a fierce woman, unable to serve her in-laws, even resorting to violence. The neighbors could not tolerate her, and after years of litigation that remained unresolved, she often resided at her mother's home, accompanying her sister in her boudoir and confiding in Feng. She spoke at length about the misfortunes of women getting married, using her own experiences as a cautionary tale. She employed her eloquent tongue to expound on the merits of remaining single, trying to persuade Feng to embrace spinsterhood. Through repeated praises and heartfelt pleadings, day and night, Feng was eventually swayed and desired to remain a maiden forever. The two elders in the family were oblivious to this. When the autumn of last year approached, Feng's wedding day drew near, but she remained steadfast in her sister's teachings. When the bridal sedan arrived at the door, she covered her face and wept against the wall. Her parents and relatives tried to persuade her, but she refused to yield. However, at the last moment, she broke her promise, delaying the auspicious occasion. How could the matchmaker explain this to the go-between? They tried to persuade her for a long time but to no avail, and were forced to negotiate with the youngest daughter, Yan, scheming to substitute her like a plum for a peach, a plan to graft a new flower onto the tree. Yan readily agreed and, after dressing up, boarded the sedan. On their wedding night, the groom, upon inquiring about the reason at the bedside, was deeply moved by her affection and showed her even greater love and respect. From then on, whenever Yan returned home, she always brought her new husband. Like a pair of mandarin ducks or inseparable fish, they were always together. Feng, however, remained a maiden living at home, without a husband, and her age was increasing. Seeing a perfect match being given away to her younger sister for no reason, she felt regret. Whenever she encountered Yan and her husband, she felt both shame and jealousy. As a result, the once close sisters became like Yin and Xing, avoiding each other. Ying was still unaware of the situation. One day, seeing Feng talking about the love between Yan and her husband, she laughed and said, "It's only like that in the beginning of a marriage. The regrets of the future will be just like mine." Feng scoffed at her, saying, "Sister, enough! How can you still not see that your actions were your own fault, and claim that all married women in the world are like you?" Ying could not endure this and responded with harsh words. From then on, the sisters became enemies, not exchanging a single word with each other. Those neighbors who knew about this all said that Ying had misguided herself and others, and pitied Feng's empty boudoir and lonely figure, a mistake that could never be undone. The autumn moon and spring breeze only deepened her eternal regret. It is said that she has recently become afflicted with madness. Alas, women are prone to deep emotions, and beautiful women often have short lives. Fair faces turn into yellow earth, a matter of time. A case like Feng's is just another in the world of love, resentment, and suffering.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang first divided the hundred or so composition books. Because these were for three grades, there were also three topics. He first separated them into three stacks, then took one from the first grade stack and began to look it over, intending to start writing. Suddenly, he heard a sound from the back door. The maid had gone out to buy groceries, and his wife was calling from downstairs:</p>
<p>"Ziliang!"</p>
<p>Ziliang deliberately didn't answer, knowing that she didn't have anything important. If he answered her, she would just keep bothering him.</p>
<p>"Ziliang! Come down here!"</p>
<p>Pan Ziliang first scooped some water from the water bowl onto the inkstone, rubbed the ink a few times, and then went to find a brush, but it wasn't on his desk.</p>
<p>"Ziliang! Why aren't you answering?"</p>
<p>Where could a brush have gone? Ziliang thought carefully and remembered. He had seen her drawing patterns on shoe uppers with it yesterday, it must be his brush. Ziliang hurried to the front room and searched in a sewing rattan box on the windowsill, and sure enough, he found a goat-hair brush.</p>
<p>"Ziliang! Are you asleep? Are you sleepwalking?"</p>
<p>She heard footsteps on the floorboards upstairs and said this deliberately. When Ziliang returned to the attic room, he heard someone knocking on the door. Yueru went to open the door. Ziliang squatted down and looked out from the small wooden openings above the wall in the sitting room, and saw that it was a mailman who had come in after the door was opened. Ziliang sat down to do his own work.</p>
<p>As soon as the front door closed, Yueru rushed upstairs again. Ziliang saw her holding a large envelope.</p>
<p>"Wang Renfu's father has died, the obituary has arrived."</p>
<p>Saying this, she handed the obituary to Ziliang. Ziliang took it but didn't look at it, placing it on the table. She said, "His old man had been sick for a long time, and finally he's died. I knew he was going to die a few years ago, now he's finally died, he's really dying for the first time."</p>
<p>His wife looked at Ziliang's desk:</p>
<p>"I called you like I was summoning a ghost, and you didn't answer. So, you were here correcting compositions. Good! Good! I'll write an article too, and ask you to correct it for me!"</p>

<h3 id="e117">Financial and Gold Prices Plummet Violently <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Plummeting Eighteen Taels and Six Mace</p>
<p>Heavily Breaching the 700-Tael Mark Yesterday, the plunge in gold prices intensified drastically, with the 700-tael mark being breached again. The massive surge and tidal wave were irresistible. The conditions were unpredictable, and the price fluctuated with a difference of eighteen or nineteen taels. Ultimately, it plummeted by more than twenty taels, causing extreme fear among the industry, like being lost in a fog, with no clear direction. The sudden drop was likely due to the silver market's expected drop not materializing yesterday, resulting in failed reports. Furthermore, the rise in the US stock market served as a catalyst for the Shanghai market. The exchange rate was unusually loose, with a longer spread for postings. Consequently, the gold price had already plummeted by more than ten taels early in the morning. Bullish firms were panicked and inclined to sell off. Subsequently, the weakness intensified, creating a sense of upheaval. It suddenly dropped to 690 taels, and then major players changed their strategy, taking advantage of the low point to buy in, which brought the price back up by more than ten taels. However, in the final situation, the trend was still weak. This morning, the large bar appeared to be rising, likely because it was Saturday afternoon, when the market usually closes.</p>
<p>A Terrible Loss of One Hundred Taels This Week The market this week experienced unprecedented massive changes, influenced by President Hoover's announcement of a moratorium on war debt payments. The highest price at the beginning of the week was 792 taels, and the lowest price on Saturday was 690 taels and 5 mace, a difference of over one hundred taels, which was unexpected. In total, there was a terrible loss of over one hundred taels. The details of yesterday's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Sharp Drop from the Start The eight-month opening at the beginning of the morning saw a sharp drop of 16 taels and 6 mace, to 704 taels. Large bars maintained their position, but private telegrams added an eighth. Firms such as Qian Changxiang, Zifengyong, and Fuyu began to sell off, followed by a drop from 06 taels to 02 taels. Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, and Bingxing did not enter, and HSBC bought English gold 1/4, immediately adding seven taels, to 709 taels. Then, Yuda, Qian Changxiang, Daxingyong, Hengyu, and others dumped their holdings. In an instant, the price plunged by ten taels, to just 699 taels. Soon after, Shunli, Wanxing, and Yuanheng bought in, pulling the price up by more than four taels, to 703.5 taels. However, the English Gold Bank bought 1/4, 1/5, and at 9:15, Taichang, Zifengyong, Qian Changxiang, Dadecheng, Bingxing, and others sold off one after another, making it difficult for the price to hold. Furthermore, the exchange rate was also loose, and the gold price dropped by eleven or twelve taels.</p>
<p>A Low of Ninety Taels and Five Mace The initial bid was 692.5 taels, with a posting spread of 25, US dollars 50 cents, and Japanese gold down 2 minutes 25. It then rose to 96 taels, immediately falling to 90 taels and 5 mace. At this time, the bank bought English gold totaling 143,125, and later Fuchang, Shunli, Yuanheng, Wanxing, Hengxing, and others followed. There were occasional sellers of English gold, but the price was 1.78 taels. At 10:20, it was 98 taels, and retail customers sold off. Then, it was 93-4 taels. After 10:30, there was a slight fluctuation of about one tael. Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, Yuanheng, Zifengyong, and others all entered. Shortly after, it rose to the 700-tael mark, likely because English Gold, Shandian, and Sumitomo absorbed 25. Around 11:40, Hengyu, Fuchang, Wanxing, etc., , and Zhengjin absorbed 1875 English gold, so it suddenly broke out of the 700 tael range, to 02 taels and 5 mace. By the midday closing, it was 02 taels, a sharp drop of 18 taels and 6 mace compared to the day before. However, Bingxing and others had a strong desire to sell goods, so after the market closed, it fell again to around 698 taels.</p>
<p>Pressing Down More Than Sixty Taels The goods were auctioned at 98 taels and 5 mace, with an early opening of 704 taels and 5 mace. The highest price here was 709 taels, and the lowest price was 690 taels and 5 mace, a fluctuation of 18 taels and 5 mace. The quoted price had already been changed to 747 taels, pressing down 53-4 to 56-7 taels, with the midday closing at 45-6 taels, recorded at 705 taels to 02 taels, with water at 05 taels.</p>
<p>Insiders Entering and Exiting The trading of various firms was chaotic. Fuyu, Hengyu, Chengfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanheng, and others exited early and then entered. Zifengyong, Fuchang, and Yuanxingyong collectively bought in. Wanxing, Shunli, and Hengxing were also buying positions. Yuda, Fuxingyong, and Qian Changxiang largely sold off. Yuantai, Yuandayong, Futaiheng, Senchangyong, Yuancheng, Dadecheng, Daxingyong, and others had frequent entries and exits. The Dalian gang collectively entered 4,000 and exited 1,200-1,300. The Guangdong gang only entered one or so.</p>
<p>Financial Industry Market Closure Period July 1st, which is Wednesday-Thursday, will be a two-day break because it is the end of June when Chinese and foreign banks close their accounts for the first half of the year. As for the gold industry exchange, goods, gold and silver market, etc., they will also be closed for two days and will not reopen until the 3rd.</p>

Other exchange rates also increased. However, the Hong Kong exchange rate did not change, remaining at 80 taels. The actual trading price of the bank was initially weak, then even looser. By midday, it returned to level, but the standard gold had already broken the 700-tael mark, creating a sense of collapse. The sharp rise in US stocks and the emerging signs of a rise in silver prices caused widespread anxiety. However, by the midday close, compared to the previous day, English gold increased by 4375, US dollars increased by 9375, Japanese gold fell sharply by 4 minutes and 75, and Chinese merchants dumped English gold, which was a good hedging opportunity, so they bought gold, totaling about 300,000 pounds.

There was no market in the afternoon due to the weekend, as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Cotton Yarn and Flower Market Return to Weakness <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market's initial decline and subsequent rise still tended towards weakness. Actual sales were significantly reduced, and all sectors lacked vitality. This was partly due to excessive purchases before the festival, and partly due to the more intense downward trend in futures yarn. Although buyers had some demand, they did not dare to act. Consequently, the market was very sluggish, and sentiment was weak, with a tendency to sell off. Therefore, the downward trend became more pronounced. Although overseas commodity prices were rising, and the silver盘算 remained high, the local market was poor due to unfavorable conditions.</p>
<p>Man-Made Indicators Decline and Then Rise In the exchange's man-made indicators, although foreign cotton rose in the morning session, sentiment was scattered, and then fell. Each fell by one or two taels. The afternoon session opened with a further decline. Later, as flower prices rebounded and some covered their short positions, the market rose by three, four, nine qian to one tael, twelve qian. The total traded volume was 57,750 bales. Mei Ji sold 1,850 bales, Yu Da 1,150 bales, Tian Long 2,250 bales, Li Chang 1,800 bales, Yi Yu 2,250 bales, and De Ji 1,250 bales. Ji Feng bought 1,500 bales, Da Fu 1,350 bales, Tong Yu 1,600 bales, Yuan Tai 1,050 bales, and Chang Feng 1,350 bales. The closing prices of the man-made indicators are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Sales Declining Spot yarn sales were very sluggish. Statistics for all sectors showed that only 250 bales were purchased throughout the day. The industry advanced 550 bales, with prices falling by five qian to one tael. Buyers from the mainland advanced 35 bales, Gaoyang advanced 15 bales, North Gang advanced 20 bales, Guangdong advanced 10 bales, Hankou advanced 10 bales, compensating for Sichuan's advance of 200 bales the previous day, and Miscellaneous Gang advanced 30 bales.</p>

<p>American Cotton Rises Sharply... Japanese Merchants Absorb Near-Term</p>
<p>The cotton market has been firmer recently, due to unfavorable news in the gold market, but the American cotton rally was strong, which strengthened sentiment. Japanese merchants also bought in the near-term, and the far-term was also driven up. However, the demand for spot cotton from various factories was sluggish. The cotton market situation was very complex, and the future lacked certainty.</p>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Rises by Half a Tael The exchange's Han indicators opened in the morning session, weak due to the poor yarn market, and each fell by five fen to one qian five fen. In the afternoon, Japanese merchants absorbed the near-term, and the market rose sharply, with each rising five or six qian, and the far-term rising two or three qian. The total traded volume was 75,700 dan. Gong Tai sold 2,600 dan, Chang Feng 3,500 dan, Shen Chang 2,500 dan, Yi Yu 3,700 dan, and Yong Chang 2,400 dan.

<h3 id="e125">Main Reasons for Last Week's American Cotton Rebound <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>President Hoover's Suggestions War Payment</p>
<p>Industry and Speculative Shorts Strongly Covered</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 26th reported on the cotton market during the week: The cotton market last week also turned upward following President Hoover's suggestions for delaying war payments. Industry and speculative shorts actively covered, and supply was limited to the liquidation of old longs and intermittent sales from the South. As a result, the market turned upward, and supplies were ready to be absorbed. Speculators' interest also increased, and the longs who bought due to delayed war payments were further empowered by the activity in the cotton market and the unfavorable news about the new flowers in the South. However, the weather in May and June was favorable, and the current temperature is high, which is likely to severely damage the bollworm. The longs for July continued to liquidate. As of yesterday, only 34,400 bales had been delivered, but they were all absorbed by spot traders to cover their short positions in the far-term. The weekend statistics are listed below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3 id="e126">Food and Rice Still Stagnant <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived from Heshang, but sales were slow. The thick粳中關貨斛 opened the most, and the price continued to rise by three and a half chi. Shipu thin rice and Sisong, Fengxi, and other goods also rose by two jiao and zero. The reed wharf tip continued to arrive, and the price fell by about one jiao. The foreign tipxiangzhuang gang had some appetite, and the price did not rise or fall. Tongbianyinhua and Jiuhua fang went to the road and were stagnant, and the price fell by nearly one chi. Yesterday, one car of Nanjing tip arrived by the Shanghai-Nanjing train and was piled up in the foreign warehouse, but few were bought in this street, and the trend was pulled down by jiao xu.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Yesterday, the source of each gang was still surging, about 267 hao. The road to this city was very few. Because the weather was hot, each rice store was unwilling to add more, and the market was declining day by day. Since the noon festival, the market price of each cargo has dropped by a small one and a half yuan. People's hearts were calm. Yesterday, thick粳 and early late rice each shortened by one or two jiao, and fried dulei was second sold, with limited ups and downs. Although there was little glutinous rice arriving, it was even more stagnant. The opening fell by five cents, because the accumulation in the middle of Pujiang was still thick, and foreign rice fell again, coupled with no Ningwei at all, with all these relations the market was not seen to return high.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Recent Flour Prices Drop to Two Liang <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening bell, there was once again significant volatility in the prices of various months. Because gold prices plummeted again, and the exchange rate increased daily, the price of foreign flour wheat was bound to gradually fluctuate. Given these circumstances, the thoughts of those inside and outside the industry were naturally affected. Therefore, after opening, the prices for the current month and July fell to two liang, August to two liang and seven and a half li, September to two liang and two and a half fen, October to two liang and four and a half fen, and November to two liang and four li and seven and a half hao, a drop of about two fen compared to the previous day. Afterwards, due to offsetting profits from short positions, there was a slight rebound. By the afternoon opening bell, the market sentiment for each month was generally stable. Because factory selling eased slightly, and mainland buyers were quite active, the situation was held up. However, looking at the future, because the exchange rate is rising and foreign wheat can be ordered step by step, it may be difficult to be optimistic in the future. As a result, the prices for the current month and August and September remained unchanged, July improved slightly by two and a half li, and October and November improved slightly by five and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Wheat Prices Plunge Before Noon <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market presented a plunging trend again in the morning. Because gold prices fell sharply, the combined price of foreign wheat gradually eased. Once this path opened, people's hearts were agitated, and it was exceptionally fierce. Because this kind of environment has been tried repeatedly, it is impossible to skillfully avoid it no matter what. Therefore, although the current month's trading was suspended, prices for July and beyond fell sharply step by step, with a drop of seven, eight, and nine fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening bell, people's hearts seemed slightly more stable. With the flour market weakening and then rebounding, prices for each month showed a slight upward trend. However, traders who were fixing foreign wheat again made several deals. For example, Australian wheat was priced at only four liang and one qian and a half, and Chicago's No. 2 spring wheat was bid at only four liang and six fen. Given this situation, there is indeed a possibility of a heavy fall in the future. As a result, July fell by five fen compared to the previous day, August fell by six fen, September and October fell by five fen, and November fell by seven fen. Spot wheat prices remain weak due to sluggish factory demand, and the asking price for medium and lower quality goods has dropped by another three to five fen. A total of over 1,900 packages of wheat from Kaihuzhou, Wusong, Anting, Nanjing, Penglai, and Yangzhou were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Silk and Tea: Lyon's Shanghai Factories are More Active Due to Demand <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market became increasingly firm due to the activation of actual sales in Lyon by Shanghai white silk factories. The reason is that French silk factories have a strong demand for autumn silk raw materials, and silk telegrams continue to be transferred to Shanghai. Although transactions are difficult to be smooth, the market sentiment is brisk. Yesterday, Xinfu and others brought in 50 packages of Shanghai white silk factory silk, and Zhonghe brought in 20 packages of Baiqian silk, and the prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e130">New York Raw Silk Opening Prices Rise <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the New York market has seen depressed raw silk opening prices due to Japanese silk merchants selling at low prices. Now, because the Japanese government is restricting the production of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons, and spring cocoons have also had a poor harvest, the market price of Yokohama raw silk is rising daily, and the price of New York raw silk is also rising accordingly. The day before yesterday, Grade A opened at $2.90, Grade B at $2.45, and Grade C at $1.90, each rising by 45 cents per pound.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Transactions for Both Black and Green Tea Are Scarce <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and China Tea Company bought over a hundred boxes of Keemun black tea, and the prices all trended down by over ten taels. The outgoing route for Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea continued to be sluggish. Although local merchants bought 210 boxes of goods through Jinlong Foreign Firm, the market price opened at 52 taels, another four or five taels lower than before. Currently, the sources from various routes are not smooth. The attitudes of Chinese merchants are mostly inconsistent due to tea quotas being short, some firm and some weak. However, broadly speaking, the future cannot be optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wuyuan Seed Tea is Eagerly Purchased <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In Wuyuan County, seed tea has been picked by mountain households for several days, and shipments are very active. However, because trademark owners have not purchased much spring tea, their need is urgent, and demand is quite exceeding supply. Ordinary tea merchants are swarming to search for purchases. Some even hold lamps and sit guarding tea households, forcibly taking the tea as soon as it is roasted, or setting the price in the morning and weighing the tea at night. The intensity of the rush purchases is truly rare. The market price remains firm at 65 to 70 cents per catty, without falling. Mountain households are happy to pick and sell because the price of seed tea is higher than that of first-flush tea. Therefore, the excitement of tea households picking and processing these days is no less than that of first-flush tea. In addition, the tea trees that did not develop enough first-flush tea are sprouting exceptionally densely. Approximately every dan of tea trees can yield 30 catties of seed tea, which is fragrant and thick, and is more than equal to first-flush tea.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Piece Goods: There Are Already Inquiries About Autumn Seasonal Woolens <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>There are many inquiries about the woolens sold in the autumn market, such as "rotten paste" woolen fabric, printed woolen fabric, "maiden" fabric, plain thick woolen fabric, hat woolen fabric, yarn woolen fabric, etc. Local merchants have pre-purchased. It is found that the recent shipments of these woolens from abroad are not many, and each store has ordered less, probably due to the increase in tariffs. Although there are also many old stocks, they are a drop in the bucket and not enough to sell. Therefore, the opening prices are more expensive than other woolens, especially for "rotten paste" woolen fabric and printed woolen fabric. Buyers are also aware of this situation, so many are rushing to purchase in advance, predicting that the selling price will definitely be firmer when they hit the market in the autumn season.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Prices Fall and Sales Are Sluggish <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the sugar market telecommunications from the production area, the price of Cuban raw sugar remained unchanged. New York futures sugar for September and May of the next year both fell by two fen, and the other months also fell by one fen each. The current and futures prices of Javanese sugar also had few fluctuations. The association's market allocation saw sluggish buying of Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white sugar, and shipments were quite strong, with the price easing to 11 taels and 2 qian, but inquiries were still scarce. No. 20 medium raw white sugar was at 10 taels and 6 qian, and transactions were also rare. The weakness of the market is truly rare. Although the Japanese sugar market has declined again, imports and exports still feel active. N-mark was at 10 taels and 8 qian, SH-mark at 10 taels and 5 qian and a half, I-mark at 11 taels and 2 qian, YRO-mark at 10 taels and 4 qian and a half, YT-mark at 10 taels and 7 qian and a half, YP-mark at 11 taels and 1 qian and seven and a half fen, old goods at 11 taels and 1 qian, LK-mark at 10 taels and 8 qian, TM-mark at 10 taels and 6 qian and a half, and Taikoo B-mark old goods at 11 taels and 1 qian and seven and a half fen. The market conditions were all stable. Trademark plate transactions were particularly quiet. ARAE Japanese sugar factory plates matched with August and September goods were priced at 4 yuan and 6 jiao in Japanese currency, with slight inquiries. It is heard that a telegram has been sent to the factory, and the price must wait for the factory's reply to be valid.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Representatives of Domestic Goods Market Petitioned Foreign Minister Wang Yesterday <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Invited All Parties to Talk</p>
<p>The negotiation committee of the domestic goods market has submitted a report on the closure of the market by the Public Works Department to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, but the report of the Public Works Department has not yet been sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Also, the representatives of the market petitioned Foreign Minister Wang yesterday. The various situations yesterday are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Situation: The negotiation committee of the domestic goods market sent representatives to Wang's residence in Guba Road the day before yesterday to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, but they did not meet him because he was out on official business. Yesterday morning at 10:00 am, Chen Weixin was still sent to the Foreign Ministry's office in Shanghai. Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang received him. While they were talking, Foreign Minister Wang arrived. The member presented the situation of the illegal closure of the domestic goods market by the Public Works Department and requested a swift and serious negotiation. According to Foreign Minister Wang, the case of the illegal closure of the market by the Public Works Department has been submitted by the Ministry to the Municipal Government for protest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot directly negotiate because it does not recognize the consular corps and the Public Works Department. He also handed the market's petition to Director Yang and ordered the Municipal Government to quickly handle it.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Talk: Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, invited talks for the domestic goods market case at 10:00 am yesterday. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Municipal Government Consultants Wu Jingxiong, Chamber of Commerce Committee members Fang Jiaobo, Market Committee members Zhang Zilian, Hong Yanbin, and Li Zhengwu, etc. were present. They discussed until 12:00 pm and dispersed. Also, the negotiation committee of the market is scheduled to send Liu Musu and Chen Weixin to the Municipal Government for petition tomorrow morning to request a quick solution.</p>
<p>Order from the Social Affairs Bureau: The Social Affairs Bureau instructed the domestic goods market yesterday, "In order to inform you in advance, according to the report, the patrolmen of the Public Concession closed the market for no reason, and the details have been reported to the Bureau. The situation has been forwarded to the Municipal Government and approved on file. Now, according to the instructions of the Municipal Government No. 10710, "This case has been seriously protested to the Public Concession Board of Directors. You should forward and listen to the solution," and so on. It is hereby ordered that the market be informed, this order."</p>
<p>French Concession Assistance: The Lawyers Association, in order to assist the domestic goods market in the case of illegal closure by the Public Works Department, sent a letter to the market yesterday, "Direct reply, received the great letter, know everything. It is scheduled for 9:30 am on the 28th (Sunday), please ask your association to send representatives to the meeting for a meeting." The negotiation committee of the market sent Dong Juesun to report the details of the closure on time to study the legal responsibilities of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e157">After the French Radio Station Stopped Receiving Commercial Telegrams <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Wusong Shanghai Coastal Radio Station Suddenly Became Busy</p>
<p>The Gushajiazhai radio station in the French Concession was privately established by the French, infringing on China's sovereignty. The government has negotiated for more than ten years. The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications ordered the Wusong Shanghai Coastal Radio Station to do its best to rectify and improve. The person in charge of the Wusong Shanghai Radio Station supervised the station staff to send all incoming telegrams from ships by telephone first to avoid excuses for foreigners. The French Embassy agreed to inform the French station to stop receiving commercial telegrams from the 15th of this month. Now, various companies and foreign firms in this city use the Wusong Shanghai Coastal Radio Station for quick transmission and efficient service, and they are very satisfied and trust it very much. Therefore, the station's business has increased sharply recently and it is overwhelmed.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Yongpu Steamer Robbed in Shipu Waters <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Disguised as Military Police, Harbor Police Disarmed</p>
<p>Over Ten Passengers Kidnapped, Losses Exceed Ten Thousand</p>
<p>Pirates are rampant in the coastal areas of Zhejiang, frequently robbing merchant ships. This time, the Yongpu steamer traveling to Shipu was again attacked by pirates, and over ten passengers were kidnapped. Yesterday, a gentleman came to Shanghai from Shipu. The reporter met him on the way and inquired about the truth of the robbery. He provided a detailed account, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Pirates Boarded the Ship. Shipu, located south of Sanmen Bay, is an important coastal area under the jurisdiction of Xiangshan County, lined with shops. Since the Shanghai-Taiwan liner began operating, commerce in the area has flourished even more. Shanghai steamers arrive at the port daily, but for those inner harbors that Shanghai steamers cannot reach, smaller vessels like the Yongpu and Haiyou operate to Sizhou, Ninghai, Yuejin, and other ports, connecting with the Shanghai-Taiwan liners. On the 19th of this month, when the Yongpu steamer departed from Shipu, over thirty pirates disguised as military police, mostly wearing old and torn uniforms, boarded the ship. The crew did not suspect anything. However, as soon as the ship left the Shipu sea area, they launched their robbery.</p>
<p>Details of the Robbery. When the Yongpu steamer arrived at the waters of the Xunjiansi area, one of the pirates came out of the cabin and shouted. The pirates then took out their pistols, first disarming the four harbor police escorting the ship and locking them in the lower cabin. They then went to the wheelhouse, monitored the captain, and drove the crew into a room. The pirates then opened the purser's office and searched for cash, then robbed each passenger on board, one by one, taking all their silver, jewelry, clothing, and other items, totaling a loss of 15,000 to 16,000 yuan. The stolen goods were piled up in one place and guarded by the pirates.</p>
<p>Kidnapping of Passengers. The pirates forced the shipowner to sail east, lasting for a day and a night. When the ship arrived at the waters of Haimen, the pirates' robbery goals had been achieved. They then frantically blew the ship's whistle, and a pirate ship immediately arrived in response, as if it had been prearranged. Approaching the Yongpu steamer, they moved all the stolen goods onto the pirate ship. Before leaving, they kidnapped over ten passengers on board, mostly businessmen. The pirates also wanted to dismantle the ship's engine parts, but the captain repeatedly begged, and they were spared.</p>
<p>Report on Return to Port. The steamer was robbed by pirates for four days and four nights. The company was anxious day and night and unable to know its whereabouts. On the 24th, the Yongpu steamer was finally released by the pirates and returned to Shipu, but when it arrived at the port, the crew and passengers were all empty-handed, having lost all their money and belongings. The families of those kidnapped wept inconsolably upon hearing the news. The captain reported the details of the pirate attack to the company to request the offshore police department to pursue the pirates.</p>
<p>Aftermath. After the Yongpu returned to Shipu, the company telegraphed the Shanghai Naval Headquarters, requesting them to quickly send warships to pursue the pirates. After the Yongpu robbery, the Shanghai-Taiwan liners in the port proposed preventive measures, paying close attention to passengers boarding the ships. Anyone with suspicious behavior or unclear addresses would be refused boarding to avoid major dangers.</p>

<p>The Factory Law was promulgated by the National Government last year and was scheduled to take effect on February 1st of this year. However, due to requests from factories in various provinces to postpone the implementation, the Ministry of Industry, considering all parties, specially obtained approval from the National Government to postpone it for six months, setting the implementation date to August 1st. It is now learned that the Shanghai factories, as the implementation date of the Factory Law approaches, and due to the recent unrest in the country, will soon submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to postpone it again for six months to allow for careful discussion.</p>

<p>The Wusong Chamber of Commerce Problem Awaits Central Resolution</p>
<p>Since the Wusong Chamber of Commerce was taken over by the Social Bureau, Shi Yunjie and more than 130 other businessmen in Wusong sent a joint telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government's Ministry of Industry, etc., on the 22nd, requesting them to uphold justice so that the association could continue to exist. This newspaper has reported this. It is now learned that the businessmen received a written reply from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, ordering them to wait for a central resolution. The original text is recorded below: Reply from the Ministry of Industry, Shangzi No. 5173: The original petition from Shi Yunjie and other businessmen in Wusong Town, Shanghai, stated that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, etc., sent personnel to remove the association's sign and collect the seal, etc., and requested that justice be upheld so that it could continue to exist and maintain French rights. The telegram and presentation have been received. It is found that the case was previously submitted by the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, stating that the association should exist, which is not unreasonable. It seems that it is necessary to establish district and town chambers of commerce. The original presentation is attached and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and the association is to be answered. It is now based on the telegrams submitted by the businessmen and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, which are being reviewed. It is appropriate to receive instructions from the Executive Yuan, and all the presentations and attachments have been received.

<h3 id="e170">ICB Deadline to Demolish Shacks, Shack Dwellers' Earnest Appeal <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Appeal to Taxpaying Chinese Association</p>
<p>Hoping to Use Foreign Staff's Salaries to Build Houses</p>
<p>Zhu Xueili, Cao Xukun, Xu Naikui, Liu Jinzhu, and other representatives of the shacks in Yangshupu protested to the ICB because the ICB set a deadline of July 1st to demolish all shacks. They also sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, requesting assistance. The letter said: We hereby inform you that the representatives have been renting land in the Yangshupu area for a long time and have built shacks to shelter themselves from the wind and rain. Although life is difficult, we have not violated any criminal laws. Although the occupation is humble, it should be protected by law. However, the ICB sent police to notify us that more than 1,000 shacks must be demolished by July 1st, which is tyrannical and cruel and will put more than 1,000 households of old and young to death. The ICB's intention is nothing more than to consider public security, hygiene, and fire safety, thinking that the place where the shack dwellers live is the source of all evil. They do not hesitate to despise humanity and destroy the law to carry out this nest-destroying act. It has been found that riots and violations, as well as hiding dirt and filth, mostly occur in prosperous areas of the city, and the lairs of thieves and kidnappers are also mostly in the city. According to statistics, this is credible. If it is recognized that there are violations and the cracking of thieves in the shack area, it must be demolished, then the first to be demolished should be the city, not the shacks. If the ICB has already demolished the houses in the city, the shack dwellers will have to endure it. Otherwise, they will swear to resist the illegal infringement to the death. In terms of hygiene, it is even more tragic. Although the shack dwellers have no real estate and do not pay direct taxes, the transfer of indirect taxes has increased without limit. The shack dwellers have no power to resist and bear the burden of death. How much does the ICB collect in total municipal donations each year and how many miscellaneous donations? May I ask if even one ten-millionth of it has been used for hygiene equipment in the shack area? Has the ICB ever had hygiene facilities that were opposed or destroyed by the shack dwellers? The laborers of the shack dwellers barely earn enough to eat and clothe themselves, so how can they have the surplus to engage in hygiene equipment? The ICB does not blame itself for its dereliction of duty, but instead thinks that the shacks are guilty. What is more unfair in the world than this? As for the fire problem, if it is proved by statistics, the city is more, and the shacks are less. The truth is that the lives and property of the shack dwellers are located there, and they are always vigilant. It is not like the residents in the city who have fire insurance and can sit back and watch the fire, letting it spread, and then calmly collect compensation afterward. Moreover, the shacks are separated from the city, and even if there is a fire, it is difficult to suffer. The above three points, even if the blame lies with the shacks, the ICB has no reason to demolish them all except to find ways to improve them. Moreover, the shacks have no guilt at all, but they are still subjected to this cruel treatment. The ICB cannot be exempted from the responsibility of compensation for damages. Not only that, if once this more than 1,000 homeless shack dwellers are demolished by the deadline, they will be displaced, the old and weak will be abandoned in the ditches, and the strong will take risks. This is the inevitable trend. Moreover, if this more than 1,000 shacks think that people's property should be protected by law, Article 17 of the Provisional Constitution has clear provisions, and according to criminal law, it can also be properly defended against illegal infringement. May I ask if the ICB also regards it as a thug and shoots it with machine guns? If a change is brewed, can the ICB be exempted from responsibility? Even more, the Shanghai Municipal Government has built hundreds of bungalows for the shack dwellers and ordered them to move in because the shacks are not hygienic. The city's annual income is more than doubled compared with the ICB. It can still find a place to live for the poor. The ICB wastes huge sums of money every year and seeks the pleasure of family members for foreign employees in every possible way. Alas, our shacks not only cannot get a little bit of it, but even the original home is arbitrarily destroyed. If the ICB has a little humanity, it only needs to move the annual salary of one foreign employee to build hundreds of thousands of bungalows. The shack dwellers are willing to repay it in monthly installments after eating. Now, relying on the sharpness of guns and artillery, the shack dwellers are put to death. No wonder the radical redification is becoming more and more rampant. It is this generation who has forced and brewed it. The shack dwellers have been toiling for a long time and have been supplied with knives. Now, if they are more aggressive and if they submit again, then there will be no eggs under the cover. In addition to entrusting lawyer You Zhi to protect it according to law and protesting to the ICB, I am afraid that the ICB will rely on its violence and despise the law. I am here to cry before your meeting again. I beg you to show your compassion and reason with the ICB, so that thousands of old and weak households will not be displaced. Otherwise, when the violence comes, the shack dwellers have sworn to die. The May 30th Massacre will not be difficult to see again. It is not a dare to alarm people with dangerous words, but it is also true that they are forced to be here. I beg you to be considerate.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Commodity Inspection Bureau Discusses Export Tea Standards <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Hired More Than Ten Chinese and Foreign Experts</p>
<p>Held at the Museum Road Tomorrow</p>
<p>Our country's tea has always been a major export. In recent decades, it has been competing with Indian, Ceylon, and Japanese tea externally. Internally, we do not know how to improve the planting methods and foreign sales. Therefore, the amount of export is declining. The Ministry of Industry, in view of this, specially announced 17 tea inspection regulations on the 20th of this month, ordering the local Nanpin inspection bureaus to implement the inspection according to law. In the future, exported tea must not be colored, adulterated, or made of rough products to maintain the export trade of tea. Now, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has already announced the Ministry's order, and tea inspection must be implemented urgently. The formulation of this standard tea must be expedited. However, in order to be prudent and correct, the bureau has specially hired Xu Shanxiang, the technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry, Xu Tinghu, the director, Wu Hengru, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, Wang Yao, Cheng, Zhang Weiru, Lu Shizhen, Zhang Kangze, Ye Yuanding, Wu Juenong, tea industry and chemical inspection experts, Tang Jishan, Chen Xiangzhou, Zhu Baoyuan, Hong Mengpan, well-known tea merchants, and Mr. Jin, the British manager of the tea department of Jinlong Foreign Company. The tea master Mr. Meckroff and 15 other members will hold the first committee meeting at 2 pm on the 29th of this month at the Commodity Inspection Bureau at No. 15 Museum Road.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Recent News on the Qu Ma Case Negotiation <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Although the Two Are Out of the Hospital, They Are Disabled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government is actively negotiating the case of American sailors repeatedly assaulting Chinese people. The Municipal Secret Service specifically replied to the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association: (1) We hereby inform you that we have received a letter from your association, stating that your fellow villagers Qu Shixiang, etc., were unreasonably assaulted by American sailors and their injuries were very serious. In addition to sending a letter from the government to the US Consul General to negotiate the punishment of the murderer and reserve the right to compensation, the letter should be sent for your reference. (2) We hereby inform you that we have received two letters from your association regarding the Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang cases, as well as summaries and photos, instructing us to investigate and handle the cases. It has been found that the case was previously presented by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, forwarded by your association, and approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the evidence of American sailors injuring and killing Chinese people and the Western names of the sailors (this case is also included). The government has negotiated and transferred the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation and reply. In view of the previous reasons for the submission, in addition to temporarily storing the incoming documents, we will immediately summarize and present them to the mayor for review and handling after the Public Security Bureau submits its reply. Please check the case and send two more copies of the photos you submitted to the government for application. Four copies of the attachment are attached. It is now known that Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang have been discharged from the hospital. Qu's injury has become a disability. The left humerus was stabbed by a knife and is bent and cannot be straightened. He can no longer work as usual. The head extends directly from the left temple to the oral cavity, causing the mouth to be crooked. He cannot chew food. The knife mark on his head is about six inches long. Ma Ruixiang's head injury is roughly the same as Qu's, but the knife mark is about an inch longer than Qu's. The molars cannot function when eating. Although they are both out of danger, they cannot return to their original state. The losses they have suffered in their lives will be presented with specific demands to achieve the purpose of compensation. It is also heard that the most important witness, Wu Abing, and two of his companions witnessed the murder weapon. The US Command escorted the murderer and retrieved the knife from under the urinal in the tavern twice. The knife has a black handle and is shaped like an extremely large paper cutter, which can be bent. In addition, there are more than ten witnesses from other shops and rickshaw pullers. The police are paying special attention and have summoned Qu Ma and other witnesses for questioning. The US Command also summoned Qu Ma twice, as well as a rickshaw puller who dragged the American sailor to the case on the same day and questioned him. His confession was the same as that of the police, proving that he was indeed injured and there were no other circumstances. The Anhui Fellow Villagers Association has now collected evidence, rushed to prepare official documents, and presented them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Municipal Government for serious negotiations. In addition to punishing the murderer, apologizing, and compensating for the case of Qu Ma and the cases of American sailors committing murder, the government is requested to negotiate the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in China and actively recover jurisdiction and concessions.</p>

<p>The Lawsuit Was Filed in the Special District Court the Other Day</p>
<p>Requesting 50,000 Yuan in Compensation for Maintenance and Comfort</p>
<p>On December 9th of last year, when the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai No. 2 aircraft flew to Wuhan, it collided with the large mast of a sand boat parked on the river bank shortly after taking off, the wing broke and the mast broke, and the plane crashed on the sandy beach by the river. The pilot, Bell, the assistant, Bian Fugen, the passenger, the Russian woman Edith Wen, and the bodyguard of Commander Xiong, Zeng Chunfan, were seriously injured. Yang Yongchun, a military officer of the National Government, and Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, were also seriously injured. Yin Wenlong, a native of Wu County, the Chinese manager of the automobile department of Anli Yanghang in Hankou, whose wife Sun Yuefang had just given birth to a son on the 7th and was extremely happy, planned to return to Hankou to comfort her, also boarded the plane and died tragically from serious injuries. The details at the time were reported earlier. It is now learned that after the tragic death of Yin's brother Wenlin, he hired lawyer Tong Yuwen to send a letter to the company on the 13th of the same month, requesting compensation. The company's legal counsel, lawyers Li Zuyu and Shi Lin, firmly refused on the 17th based on the example of force majeure. Yin's brother then hired lawyer Liu Shifang and sent another letter to Li Shi on January 17th of this year to negotiate everything. Lawyer Li sent a letter on the 21st to firmly refuse. Yin then proceeded with litigation procedures on the one hand, and Tong and Liu made a warning letter on the other, limiting the time to give a satisfactory reply within three days, otherwise they would decide to file a lawsuit. The Chinese person in charge of the company was very willing to settle the matter quickly, but the American did not agree. The lawyer Liu Shifang and Tong Yuwen filed a lawsuit against China National Aviation Corporation on behalf of Yin Zibenrong, who was less than a month old, and his legal representative, Yin's wife Sun Yuefang, requesting compensation for: (1) funeral expenses, (2) maintenance expenses for the two plaintiffs, and (3) comfort money for the two plaintiffs, totaling 50,000 yuan, and bearing all litigation costs in the case. The lawsuit was filed in the Special District Court the other day (26th).</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate</p>
<p>A total of 106 silk factories in the city, including Tongyi, employing 45,000 female workers, 24,000 child laborers, and 4,200 male workers, considering the factories' operating losses and to show labor-management cooperation, agreed in October of last year to temporarily calculate wages at 85% of the original rate. The work schedule was changed to two shifts per month, and Sunday holidays were temporarily suspended until the end of May 1931, when everything would revert to the original terms. Now that the deadline has passed and the issuance of silk industry public bonds is imminent, the workers demanded a return to the previous conditions. However, the factories, citing poor market conditions, repeatedly delayed and refused to restore the original terms. The Silk Reeling Industry Association repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate with the Silk Industry Guild. As a result, the employers agreed to increase female workers' wages from 51 cents to 57 cents and to restore the work schedule to its original state of four days per month. Sunday holidays would pay female workers 20 cents, and child laborers 10 cents. The labor side immediately convened a meeting of representatives of all workers in the city to discuss solutions. However, the workers unanimously insisted that all wages, work schedules, holiday bonuses, and other benefits must be fully restored without any reduction, and they would not stop until their demands were met. Because the attitude of all the workers was so firm and to avoid any further unfortunate incidents, the union yesterday submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, asking them to promptly convene a meeting of labor and management for mediation.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Letter to Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member, received a letter yesterday from Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central National Arts Institute, appointing them as advisors to the institute. The letter stated: "I have long admired your virtues and hoped to have your guidance. I recently spoke with Mr. Tisheng and expressed my admiration for those contemporary talents who share the joys and sorrows of the Party and the nation. I have always known that you, sir, are a pioneer of the revolution and a leader of the masses, and your character and righteousness are truly admirable. Now, Mr. Tisheng and I have been entrusted by the National Government to serve in the Central National Arts Institute, and we have no choice but to move forward bravely. We believe that our nation's decline makes it difficult to stand in today's world of great power competition. Therefore, to seek self-preservation, we should emulate the physical education movements of Japan and Europe, leading our people towards national fitness, which may help restore our national status. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved by the efforts of a few people, let alone someone as dull as myself. I dare not be lazy and complacent, but rather hope that you, sir, will use your love for the Party and the nation to help us gather our strength and provide guidance for the promotion of national fitness. Together, we can support and benefit the Chinese nation. After discussing with Mr. Tisheng, I am writing this special letter to respectfully request that you accept a position as an advisor to our institute. We eagerly await your arrival and will surely learn from you." After receiving the appointment, both gentlemen, recognizing that promoting national spirit and restoring inherent skills are essential to saving our declining nation, plan to respond to the invitation to serve.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Military Affairs ordered that the steel mill's existing stock of steel be supplied to the Jinling, Shanghai, Gongxian, Jinan, and Hanyang arsenals, the mill's previous stock has been exhausted.

After months of planning and renovation by the mill's director, Zhou Zhihong, it is reported that all the furnaces have been completed. Workers have been hired, and 500 tons of pig iron ordered from England have arrived.

<h3 id="e180">Cai Yuanpei Swindled Out of Fifty Dollars <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Bold Swindlers Impersonate to Deceive</p>
<p>Many Households Have Been Deceived</p>
<p>Fortunately Discovered by Tang Haian</p>
<p>Four Swindlers Sentenced to Two Years Each</p>
<p>Several days ago, four uninvited guests suddenly visited the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office. Some were dressed in Western suits, others in Zhongshan suits. They presented calling cards and requested an audience with Superintendent Tang Haian. Superintendent Tang, seeing the names "Liu Jucen, Qi Ziwen, Lin Ziqing, and Xu Shicai" on the cards, realized he did not know any of them. However, their intentions seemed quite serious, so he agreed to meet them. During the meeting, the four men claimed to be representatives from the Anhui Epidemic Hospital, sent to Shanghai to raise funds. They presented a donation book and asked Superintendent Tang to generously donate to support their good cause. After reviewing the donation book and questioning them in detail, Tang noticed many suspicious points. He suspected they were imposters trying to swindle money. He immediately detained them and telephoned the Xinzha Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest the four men and seize the donation book. They also went to Liu's residence at 733 Edward Road and found a large box of forged seals and several donation books. The four were immediately imprisoned, and an investigation was launched. It has now been determined that many households in the city have been deceived. Notable victims include the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Securities and Commodities Exchange. However, the fraudulent schemes were not uniform. When defrauding the Banks of China and Communications, they used the name of the National Tour and Inspection Group. Each bank was swindled out of ten dollars, or sometimes four or five dollars. The Chinese Cotton Mill Association on Edward Road was swindled out of forty dollars, under the guise of establishing an industrial factory to support wounded soldiers from the 1911 Revolution. They even used this pretext to swindle fifty dollars from Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica. The audacity of their actions is evident. Yesterday morning, the police brought the representatives of the deceived businesses, along with Liu and the others, to the Special District Court for investigation. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned them. The four defendants, Liu and the others, confessed that they had been driven by economic hardship to commit fraud. Judge Wu reviewed the confessions and sentenced Liu, Qi, Lin, and Xu to two years of imprisonment each for habitual fraud. The donation books and seals were confiscated.</p>

<p>Kindness of Police Lawyer</p>
<p>Zhang Panqin, a foreman from Pudong working at the Zhonghua Industrial Company in Caojiadu, had an affair with Yao Gu, a woman living in the same building. Annoyed by his wife Zhang Ji's nagging, Zhang Panqin contemplated suicide. He and Gu went to Room 318 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road and ingested opium. Zhang soon died from poisoning, and his body has been reported to the authorities and confirmed. It was ordered to be collected and buried. Gu was sent to the hospital for treatment. This information has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Gu's husband, Yao, is from Changzhou and works as a general affairs clerk at a school in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Room and board are provided at the school, and he only returns home once a week. Gu, although 32 years old, is not accustomed to living alone, which is why she became acquainted with Zhang, leading to this tragic love suicide. After Gu recovered, the police believed that, even though it was suicide, she should be held legally responsible. They brought her before the Summary Court of the Special District Court. The judge believed that she had</p>
<p>suspicion of inciting suicide and ordered that she be prosecuted in the local court. Yesterday morning, the police representative, lawyer Ru Baoyi, filed a lawsuit against Gu based on Article 290 of the Criminal Law. Presiding Judge Zhou Han opened the court and questioned her. Lawyer Ru stated the case and said that, according to the third clause of the law, those who plan to die together may be exempted from punishment. He asked the court to consider whether the defendant was eligible for this clause. When questioned, Yao Gu stated that she originally lived at 71 Renshou Lane, Bailinan Road. Zhang Panqin and his wife also lived in the same building. Three months ago, Zhang's wife, Ji, returned to her hometown to give birth, leaving Zhang alone. At this time,</p>
<p>an affair developed between us. Later, due to gossip, I moved to a room in 95 Xinkang Lane, Bailinan Road. Unexpectedly, Zhang could not forget me and moved his family to the upper floor of the same building. Since then, I have been constantly subjected to his wife Ji's jealousy. On the 21st of this month, the couple argued again because of this. To avoid further trouble, I went out the next day and took a streetcar to Nanjing Road, intending to transfer to the Route 5 streetcar and go to the French Concession to discuss moving with my husband. Unexpectedly, Zhang</p>
<p>waited for me at the streetcar station. I was forced to go with him to the Andong Hotel to commit suicide together. I have a son and a daughter; how could I bear to leave them? Seeing that I was unwilling to be a lovebird to the death, Zhang threatened to strangle me with a rope. I had no choice but to follow him. Zhang then took out opium paste, rolled it into a ball, and I swallowed ten pills. He only took four or five pills. Zhang had prepared the suicide note at home in advance. After arriving at the hotel, I wrote a letter to my mother, stating the reasons for this suicide. Zhang also said at the time that we</p>
<p>were committing suicide because of love and that the reports in the newspapers would bring great fame. My brothers and uncles all work at the Tongshang Trust Company, so I really did not want to die. I only complied because I was coerced. Now, if my husband is still willing to forgive me for my flaws and take me back, I swear to turn over a new leaf and abide by the virtues of a woman to make up for my past mistakes. If there is no hope of reconciliation, I will only throw myself into the Jiliang Institute. At this point, she seemed very distressed, and tears flowed down her face. The police lawyer immediately stated that, according to this situation, Gu may not have incited suicide. According to her testimony, she ingested more opium than the deceased. However, her husband has</p>
<p>disowned her since this case. Her husband was not present in court today, which proves this. Therefore, if the case is ruled in her favor, it will be difficult for her to find a place to live and this could drive her to attempt suicide again. If she is sent to the Jiliang Institute, as she requested, her children would be left without anyone to care for them. For the sake of both parties, the presiding judge should summon her husband, Yao, to court and persuade him. Yao may recall their past affection and restore their old relationship, so that the couple can be reunited. Presiding Judge Zhou deeply believed that the lawyer's statement was insightful and ruled Yao Gu innocent, but she will be temporarily held at the detention center while awaiting the summons of her husband for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Yangtse to Offer Pootoo Service <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire Assigns the New Peking</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Directly Enter Our Inland Waterways</p>
<p>Motive for Opening the Route: Every summer, Chinese shipping companies such as China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ping'an often offer the Pootoo service to facilitate passengers seeking refuge from the heat. Pootoo has excellent scenery, and it only takes a few hours to reach from Ningbo. Most Chinese shipping lines in this port use ships from the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Taiwan routes, adding a Pootoo stop on their weekly schedules. Now, as the ships are beginning their service, the number of Westerners in Shanghai seeking refuge there is increasing daily. Therefore, they specifically requested that the British-owned Butterfield &amp; Swire company also offer a Pootoo route for Western passengers. Butterfield &amp; Swire has agreed and will begin operating the route with ships from July onwards.</p>
<p>Assigned Schedule: Butterfield &amp; Swire has decided to use the New Peking, a ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, to inaugurate the Pootoo service. Every Friday, the ship will depart from Shanghai, first arrive at Ningbo, and then proceed to Pootoo. The first trip is scheduled for July 3rd, and eight trips are planned. While the business is mainly aimed at Westerners, Chinese passengers will still be carried.</p>
<p>Business Situation: Butterfield &amp; Swire's operation of the Pootoo route is a pioneering venture. The company has decided that each departure will reserve thirty seats in the main dining room specifically for Western passengers, while the remaining seats will be available for Chinese passengers. Each Western passenger seat is priced at 1,500 yuan, and the eight trips will generate 12,000 yuan in revenue. This is the first time a foreign ship has operated in Pootoo, and it seems to infringe on China's maritime rights.</p>

<p>Girl Not Yet Sixteen Years Old</p>
<p>Procecuted for Rape</p>
<p>On the night of June 12th, a young girl attempted suicide in the Suzhou Creek and was rescued by the water police. She was taken to the local court, where she was identified as Zheng Xuanying. She had been seduced and abandoned by Guan Daming, the supervisor of a shoe store at the Highland Department Store on Jingan Temple Road, and felt too ashamed to live. Wu Shixin, the prosecutor of the local court, determined to rectify public morals. He ordered the police to arrest Guan and sent Police Chief Xu to investigate the matter thoroughly. It was discovered that the girl was seventeen years old, but was not yet sixteen years old when she was seduced last year. According to the law, seducing a girl under sixteen is considered rape, so he invoked the crime of harming public morals and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng opened the court and questioned Guan Daming, who stated that he was thirty-one years old, lived at 1152 Jingan Temple Road, and had a wife, Shen, and a son. (Question) Did Zheng Xuanying live together? (Answer) She moved in on March 21st of last year, living on the third floor. (Question) How much was the rent? (Answer) Twenty yuan. (Question) How many people lived there? (Answer) Five people. (Question) How many rooms did you have? (Answer) Two rooms. (Question) When did you have a relationship? (Answer) They previously said they worked at a newspaper, but in reality, they had no business. The sisters went out every afternoon and returned late at night, sometimes not at all. I was annoyed by this and warned them, and they bore a grudge. The Shenzhou Hotel and the New Gaosheng Hotel stories are not true. Zheng Xuanying, also known as Zheng Huizhen, stated that she was seventeen years old. (Question) When were you born? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) When is your birthday? (Answer) June 11th. (Question) Did you live with your parents? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Yes. (Question) When did you jump into the river? (Answer) June 13th. (Question) Why did you commit suicide? (Answer) I couldn't stay home, so I stayed at my younger sister's place. But my sister moved away. (Question) Why couldn't you stay at home? (Answer) I was deceived by Guan Daming. (Question) How were you deceived? (Answer) He tricked me into studying. (Question) When? (Answer) Last June. (Question) Tricked you into going where? (Answer) Later, to see a movie. (Question) What happened after seeing the movie? (Answer) He booked a room. (Question) Did you go in June? (Answer) We didn't book a room before, it was on October 2nd, I was tricked into losing my virginity at the Shenzhou Hotel in room 204. (Question) Did you sleep with him, or alone? (Answer) Together. (Question) How many nights? (Answer) One night. (Question) Did your father ask you? (Answer) No. (Question) You went out often, wouldn't he be suspicious? (Answer) I claimed to be at my younger sister's place. (Question) What happened later? (Answer) We opened another room at the New Gaosheng Hotel, room 30 on November 18th. He sent me home at 9:00 pm. On November 26th, my father saw me sitting in Guan's car, which exposed the affair, and he forbade me from staying at home. Guan put a business card on me and told me to stay at the New Gaosheng Hotel for two nights. He didn't come. I called him, but he didn't come either. I met him on the street, and he scolded me and ignored me. So, I stayed at my younger sister Cai Yueying's place at 1006 Fuxi Lane, Cade Road. Cai went to Xiamen, so I committed suicide. (Question) Do you want to sue him? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Are you telling the truth about being willing to go with him? (Answer) I was actually tricked into going to the hotel. Zheng Xintao stated that he was fifty-eight years old, previously worked as a pawnbroker, and is now unemployed. Xuanying is his youngest daughter. (Question) Do you have an older daughter named? (Answer) Qiuqin. (Question) When did Xuanying leave? (Answer) Last year. (Question) Why did you force her to leave? (Answer) It was shameful, he sat in Guan's car, and argued on Gordon Road. (Question) Did your daughter come home? (Answer) She came twice when I was not home. This time, the water police notified me. So, besides wanting justice, I want compensation of 20,000 yuan. The court asked the witness Hu Ronglin, twenty-three years old, from Taizhou, a tea server at the New Gaosheng Hotel, to identify Guan. Zheng pointed out that Guan resembled the man who booked the room that day. She also confirmed that Zheng was the woman that day, who arrived at 2:00 pm and left at 6:00 pm. The court then questioned Zheng Xuanying as to why her statements did not match. (Answer) I forgot. The court ordered the tea server to continue testifying, that Zheng later came alone and stayed for two days in room 26. She called Guan Daming, but he didn't come. I don't know anything else. The court asked the bookkeeper Meng Zhisong, fifty-one years old, from Chuansha, the bookkeeper at the New Gaosheng Hotel, that the first time a man and a woman booked a room, the man said he was from the Highland Department Store, and the woman was Zheng Xuanying. The second time she stayed for two days, it was a female guest alone. She made two phone calls in the accounting room, calling Guan Daming. The name of the guest was also reported as Guan Daming. Regarding the registration book, it was written by the bookkeeper, but the guest could also write the registration form himself. At this point, prosecutor Zhong made his closing argument. After the lawyers for both parties debated, the judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 30th. The defendant was remanded into custody.</p>

<p>Files for Divorce and Alimony</p>
<p>Xie Jiu Did Not Appear; Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Xie Jiwu, also known as Jianhu, the eldest son of Xie Zhongsheng, the former manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, nicknamed Xie Jiu, married Ms. Tao Qichun two years ago through a matchmaker. After getting married in Suzhou, they came to Shanghai together and resided at 31 Jingan Temple Road. Initially, their relationship was harmonious, but soon it turned cold. Xie has been accused of assault by his wife's lawyers, Yan Eson and Ni Zhengao, and has fled to avoid punishment. In addition to pursuing criminal charges, Tao has also filed for divorce and alimony from Xie, seeking more than 50,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong of the Civil Division of the Special District Court opened the court to hear the case. The defendant did not appear despite being summoned. Tao Qichun, heavily pregnant, arrived at court with her lawyer. The lawyer stood up and stated the facts of the plaintiff's repeated mistreatment and the reasons for requesting alimony and future children's education expenses. The calculation method was based on the plaintiff's current age of twenty-two, assuming she would live to sixty, leaving thirty-eight years. The annual living expenses were 1,200 yuan, totaling more than 45,000 yuan, plus several thousand for education expenses. He also stated that, since the defendant failed to appear despite being summoned, a default judgment should be issued. After Judge Xu questioned the plaintiff, he ordered the parties to withdraw and await the scheduled sentencing.</p>

<p>Six Knife Wounds, Intestines Spilled Out</p>
<p>Murder Weapon Still Lodged in Neck</p>
<p>Yesterday, an unidentified male corpse was discovered in the Zhangjiabang area behind the Hujiazhai residence, west of Xujiahui town. The villagers reported it to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District. Upon receiving the report, Chief Liu led the police to investigate. The corpse was a man in his thirties, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, yellow socks, and cloth shoes. He was lying on the bank of the river, head to the east and feet to the west. He had six knife wounds on his body, and his intestines were spilling out, a gruesome sight. An eight-inch-long sharp knife was still lodged in his neck, not removed. However, there was no blood on the ground. The area was very remote. It is presumed that he was murdered elsewhere and the body was moved to this location. It was very close to Hongqiao Road, only about a hundred steps away. He ordered the local Baojia, Wang Maogong, to report to the court for an autopsy. At 4:00 pm yesterday, prosecutor Zhao Zhiji was commissioned to arrive at the scene for the autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the corpse was indeed murdered. As no family members were found, he ordered the Baojia to prepare a coffin for burial and to send the knife to be kept on file, pending investigation of the murderer.</p>

<p>All People on the Boat Have Disappeared</p>
<p>Limited Number of Geese Remaining</p>
<p>West of Kunshan Station along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, about three miles north of Zhengyi Station in the countryside of Jiangqiao, a large number of white geese, about a thousand, were discovered on the morning of the 24th of this month, eating rice seedlings in the fields. When the local villagers saw them, they thought they were swans and gathered to catch them, killing dozens of them. The villagers took them home to cook. Around 4:00 pm, the Zhengyi branch of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau found out and sent police officers to investigate. The officers returned to the bureau and reported that there were a total of 973 white geese. A chicken and duck shop in Fengmen, Suzhou, hired two boats to transport the geese to Shipai Town on the border of Kunshan and Bacheng for sale. There was a shop owner, three crew members, and a child on the boats. They sailed along the Suzhou Pond and passed through Zhengyi Harbor from south to north on the afternoon of the 23rd. In the evening, they stopped for the night at Jujiang Bridge, about three miles from the town. For unknown reasons, all the people on the boats disappeared, leaving only an empty boat. It is said that only about two hundred or so white geese remain. The whereabouts of the boatmen are unknown. The local Public Security Area is currently sending police officers to investigate the truth of this case in detail for further action.</p>

<p>Yueying, the 22-year-old daughter of farmer He Lingen from Hejiatang, Twenty-sixth Ward, Southwest Township, Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, married Yonggen, the son of farmer Zhu Guanbao from No. 3, Zhujiazhai, nearby, through a matchmaker last spring, April. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was considered harmonious. However, the husband's aunt, Zhang, who was over fifty years old, still possessed a flirtatious nature, resulting in a widespread notorious reputation, known to everyone in the vicinity. She was also extremely fierce. Furthermore, Yonggen was also having an affair with a woman surnamed Mou from a neighboring family. As a result, the husband and his parents treated Yueying almost like a thorn in their side, frequently abusing her, even to the point of beating her. The atmosphere within the family was like hell. Unable to bear it, she returned to her mother's home to weep and complain. After her father, Wu Lingen, kindly consoled her, he sent her back to the Zhu family multiple times. On the twelfth of this month, Yueying, again due to a minor quarrel, returned to her mother's home to stay temporarily. On the day before yesterday (the 25th), at 4 p.m., Yueying returned home alone. When she left, her expression was cheerful, and there was nothing unusual about her. However, at around 9 p.m. that evening, Yueying suddenly hanged herself in her room. After someone reported this to her father, Wu Lingen, he rushed to investigate and found wounds on Yueying's body. Consequently, he reported this to the Sixth District Third Sub-precinct, requesting an investigation and arrest. After receiving the report, Chief Liu immediately dispatched Officer Yuan and police officers to the scene. Zhu Guanbao and his son had already fled. Only Zhang was at home. Examining the body, they found a purplish-red mark around the neck, several red wounds on the right side and left armpit, and faint bluish-red bruises visible on the outside of the right knee. It was confirmed that she had hanged herself after being beaten to death. Upon investigating the neighbors, it was confirmed that they had heard cries for help that evening. Therefore, Zhu Zhang was taken to the precinct for further investigation. Chief Liu also instructed Zhao Hongxiang, the local ward head, to report the matter to the court for an inquest. Prosecutor Wu was commissioned to conduct an inquest in the countryside. The inquest determined that the deceased had indeed died by hanging herself before death. The family was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial. However, the deceased's elder sister, Wu Xiqing (a current teacher), believed that her sister's death was suspicious. Yesterday, she submitted a written request to the court for a re-examination. Simultaneously, she reported to the precinct, requesting that they find a way to arrest Zhu Guanbao and Zhu Yonggen, father and son. After a preliminary hearing by the precinct chief, Wu Lingen, the deceased's father, recounted the previous events and pleaded for justice on her behalf. According to Zhu Zhang's statement, she was 52 years old. Her daughter-in-law, Wu, returned home at 4 p.m. yesterday. Because her husband was working at the China Cemetery, and she and her son were working in the fields, neither of them was at home. After returning home, Wu asked her for the key, opened the door, and went back out to work. When she returned home in the evening, Zhang cooked, and the daughter-in-law fetched water by the riverside, returned to her room to do laundry, and closed the door. When her son, Yonggen, returned to the room, he asked her to eat dinner. Unexpectedly, Wu had already hanged herself from the horizontal beam in front of the bed. Yonggen immediately rushed forward to take her down, but she had already died. Zhu Guanbao and his son gave statements that were largely the same as Zhang's. However, they vehemently denied any beating or abuse. Chief Liu, considering that the case involved a life, sent Zhu Guanbao, Zhu Yonggen, Zhu Zhang, along with Wu Lingen, the deceased's father, to the bureau for review.</p>

<h3 id="e192">The "Consumption Inevitably Leads to Death" Theory and New Treatments for Lung Disease <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Copied and translated from a German journal on tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(1) The Origin of the "Consumption Inevitably Leads to Death" Theory</p>
<p>Xingzhi　　　often. But the difficulty for doctors.　Spreads widely. There is nothing quite like tuberculosis (i.e., consumption). Tuberculosis attacks us.　　　　. Without interruption. It is the most harmful and deadly infectious disease. It is what we fear the most. Since ancient times, it has been determined to be 　　　　 a certain death　. Because it is truly difficult to treat after contracting it. Therefore, doctors are at a loss when they encounter it. Patients who contract it are filled with fear and despair. Every day, there is the worry of　　　　　. But in modern times. With the advancement of medicine and the emergence of famous doctors, precise research has shown that tuberculosis is not necessarily an incurable disease. If 　　　　 method　 is used. Eight or nine out of ten who are treated in the early stages are cured. Even those in the second or third stage have hope of recovery.　 If the disease has been contracted for too long. After　　　　, patients in the terminal stage have no way to be saved. However, contracting a disease for so long that it cannot be treated is not unique to tuberculosis. It is hoped that those who contract this disease will not neglect treatment in the early and middle stages. Treatment and recuperation is possible.</p>
<p>(2) The Discovery of the Tuberculosis Pathogen</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the medical communities of both the East and the West have had many empty theories and conjectures about the cause of tuberculosis. All were dark and unclear. Recently, the German　　　　 scholar Dr. Koch discovered that the tuberculosis bacterium is the cause of tuberculosis. This broke through thousands of years of darkness and shone a ray of great light. Just as the cholera bacterium is the cause of cholera, the diphtheria bacterium is the cause of diphtheria, and the dysentery bacterium is the cause of dysentery. Other diseases, such as syphilis, are caused by the syphilis spirochete, and leprosy is caused by the leprosy bacillus. This is known throughout the world. Tuberculosis is also the same. The cause of its occurrence is the tuberculosis bacillus. This bacillus most likes to attack humans. It mainly lives and breeds in our lungs. The number of humans harmed by it is countless. In the past, it accounted for one-seventh of the world's population. In modern times, it accounts for one-sixth. In cities, it reaches one-fifth. It is truly the most widespread infectious disease.</p>
<p>(3) The Two Great Benefactors of Those with Lung Disease</p>
<p>(1) Dr. Robert Koch of Germany. He was born in 1843 in the city of Klausthal, Germany. His family was quite well-off. Therefore, he was able to focus on his studies from a young age. After graduating from middle school, he attended various universities in the country to study medicine. Before the age of thirty, he discovered the bacteria responsible for　. Famous doctors in the country were captivated by his work. Several years later, on March 24, 1882, Dr. Koch presented his research on the tuberculosis bacillus at the German Physiological Society in Berlin. At the time, the medical communities of various countries were shaken by it. The German government praised his scholarship and appointed Dr. Koch as the director of the Institute of Hygiene. Emperors from various countries also presented him with high-level medals. Universities from various countries competed to send him honorary degrees. In 1905, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was also awarded to the old doctor. He can be said to have achieved the highest honor in the academic world. Those who treat tuberculosis today all base their work on Koch's discovery. His contribution to saving lives and helping the world is something that humanity around the world should be grateful for.</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Bergell of Germany. Since Dr. Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacillus as the cause of tuberculosis, scholars of tuberculosis in the East and the West have competed to conduct research, hoping to find a miraculous way to kill this bacillus. However, the results have all been failures. This is because ordinary doctors in the past did not understand that the tuberculosis bacillus has a unique and special structure. After Dr. Bergell's painstaking research, he discovered that the tuberculosis bacillus has a special defense that can resist all external medicinal attacks. The tuberculosis bacillus is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax.</p>
<p>If a method is not found to destroy the wax barrier and disarm the fatty armament, then there is no way to capture the tuberculosis bacillus and put it to death. Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great benefactor of all lung disease sufferers in the world, collected all kinds of medicinal substances from animals, plants, and minerals, and conducted painstaking research for decades. It is unknown how much brainpower he exhausted and how many times his heart membrane gland compressed his juice. There is a special effective component that has a strong dewaxing effect on the tuberculosis bacillus. This is truly a great success in the fundamental treatment of tuberculosis, a question that has never been answered in thousands of years of medical history.</p>
<p>German Dr. Natterer's Map of the Distribution of Pulmonary Arteries and Bronchial Tubes</p>
<p>(4) Special Efficacy Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e. consumption) is caused by the tuberculosis bacillus. When this bacillus enters the human body, it forms nodules in that area to cut off the flow of blood. The tuberculosis bacillus can also secrete an acid-fast wax to surround its body, preventing the invasion of all external medicinal powers, so even if various bactericidal drugs are used, either internally or by injection, they cannot reach the actual substance of the pathogen. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, pharmaceutical therapy, and other treatments that have been commonly used by doctors in the past have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for consumption has spread throughout the world. This is because they did not know this profound science. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above-mentioned science, continue to research and spare no effort. The result is this chemical saint, named Sanosin, that kills all pulmonary tuberculosis bacilli. This medicine was invented and successfully developed according to the latest medical theory of German Dr. Koch, the inventor of the tuberculosis bacillus, and German Dr. Bergell, the inventor of the tuberculosis bacillus dewaxing technique. According to current experimental reports from tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules and dissolving the wax of lung diseases, and has bactericidal power, which can radically cure pulmonary tuberculosis in stages one, two and three, and indeed has the special effect of omnipotence. In China, it has been tested by the Central Health Experiment Institute of the National Government, the medicinal properties are peaceful and non-toxic, and there are absolutely no side effects. A brief summary of the medical effects is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, after one minute, all tuberculosis bacilli disappear their acid resistance, and after three minutes, the pulmonary tuberculosis bacilli are completely killed, and none are spared.</p>
<p>(2) Animal experiments have found that "Sandixing" can penetrate into the tuberculosis nodules. An examination of the latent tuberculosis bacilli in the nodules shows that they have all lost their acid resistance. This is sufficient proof that the wax has completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If patients take "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see a good condition such as diluted phlegm and lowered body temperature.</p>
<p>(4) Continuing to take "Sanosin" internally for more than thirty to sixty days will show a visible increase in body weight, increased appetite, and all symptoms will gradually subside, eventually achieving the great achievement of returning to life.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Merchants Association received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "We have received a letter from the Business Tax Preparation Office of the Shanghai Finance Bureau stating that your association stated in its official letter that the Shanghai bean and rice merchants have always paid the Brokerage Tax and do not need to pay the Business Tax again. However, the current Business Tax Regulations in this city list a grain industry, and the trade association is concerned and requests an explanation. We have sent a letter to inquire and reply so that we can forward it to you, etc. Approved. Upon investigation, the draft business tax rate table of this city, the grain industry item, refers specifically to those who sell grain. As for the merchants who act as agents for customers to buy and sell and have a brokerage license, they should be changed to business tax in accordance with Article 20 of the draft Business Tax Regulations of this city and collected at the old tax rate. The current tax rate is not included in the package. We have approved the letter for you to check and forward to you, etc., so that the association can check accordingly," etc. After receiving the letter, the trade association believed that the matter was related to the tax rate, so it printed a notice to inform the trade and scheduled a meeting to convene north and south to discuss the measures.</p>

<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received a telegram from Liu Pingjie, the representative of the refugee group in the Second District of Hushan County, Anhui Province, stating: "Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Chinese Red Cross Society. Since the Republic of China, Hushan has been connected to Henan and Hubei, and defeated soldiers and bandits often haunt the area, and the losses are immeasurable. In addition, water and drought disasters have occurred repeatedly over the years, and the output of goods has been short, and the vitality has been depleted. However, there has been nothing as tragic as the Red Disaster since the eighteenth year of the Republic. The Hushan territory has been ravaged, plundered, and burned by the Communist bandits for three years, and most of the areas hit by disaster are extremely desolate, with broken tiles and crumbling walls, and white bones are exposed. Next, the wooden doors are tightly closed, and no one is inside. The stony fields and barren gardens are filled with foxes and rabbits. The broken and residual situation in the past is already unbearable to sigh and mourn. The more than 70,000 refugees in our dilapidated district, who are in a dilemma and have nine lives, are wandering on the road, and the whole family is migrating far away, like ants gathering in the mountains, like dogs that have lost their homes everywhere, like high tides and waves, all people belong to the fish that slipped through the net, and the rest of their lives in the tiger's mouth cannot be sustained by the wind and dew, and the rabbit's den has not been dug, how can they withstand a few changes of stars and frosts? Already eagerly traveling, and still sadly where to go? Begging from door to door, the dishes on the table are everyday. Asking about fields and houses, the night follows the branches to roost. Accumulating hardships and dust, Tao Jin looks at each other. As a result, the living hate not to die, and the dead still lament the later time. The long sky, what is the end? I have always admired your society's broad generosity and relief of difficulties, and the Chinese and foreigners are the same. I hope you will have great compassion and give generous relief, benevolence, and righteousness of grain, and immediately give grace and kindness. Please remit the funds to the County Party Department of Hushan County, Anhui Province, for transfer. If you send personnel to distribute the funds, you should respectfully welcome them. The telegraph is tearful, waiting for good news. Liu Pingjie, Yu Guanzhi, Dai Qichang, Yu Yaping, Zhang Yiyuan, Yu Rongqi Xu Lanting, Du Youzhong, and other representatives of the refugee group in the Second District of Hushan County, Anhui Province, respectfully kowtow, and cleverly seal."</p>

<p>The Taiyuan Lane Tenants Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the landlord Zhu Yicai, stating: "We, the tenants, have rented your property in Taiyuan Lane, a section of Xinxinqiao Aiduya Road, Xizilaihuo Street, Ningxing Street, French Concession, for nearly two years since last year. Unexpectedly, the market here is sluggish, business is not good, expenses are huge, and losses are even worse. Recalling the beginning, we originally hoped to invest to seek profit and to achieve the desire of a fly's head. Unexpectedly, we have achieved the opposite. The reason is that the rent of your property is too expensive. Even the daily business income is not enough to cover the rent. Therefore, all tenants are sitting in sorrow and panic. It is as if a great disaster is coming. We tenants are all small businessmen, how can we endure this suffering? And there is no permanent property, and it is difficult to last for a long time. If we wait to die, it is not appropriate. For this reason, we tenants have no choice but to jointly express our difficulties in detail to your platform. I hope that your landlord will forgive me, understand the situation below, and approve the reduction of the rent of Taiyuan Lane by a certain percentage, to ease the burden and live a peaceful life, which is all given by your landlord, which is a great kindness, and there is no end to our gratitude, and we wait for your reply, how can we win the extreme expectation."</p>

The manager and deputy manager of the branch, Mr. Sun and Mr. Shen, are both experienced, stable, and highly respected.

<p>At 6:30 p.m. last night, at No. 3 Xinkang Road, Jiangxi Road, the upper-level elevator failed mechanically and suddenly dropped, causing a young man, about 20 years old and resembling a student, to be injured, damaging his vital parts.

<p>Grave Site Sold Illegally by His Uncle</p>
<p>Chen Atang, a hawker who was brutally beaten to death by Japanese sailors five years ago, was seriously involved with the Japanese government after the tragic case, with the assistance of Wu Kaisheng, a lawyer, and the assistance of various groups. Negotiations were held and a lawsuit was filed with the Nagasaki District Court. As a result, two murderers were sentenced to two years of detention and two years of imprisonment, to be served concurrently for four years. The bereaved family of the deceased was given a consolation payment of 3,000 yuan to be used as follow-up alimony for the children and mother. A portion of it was used to purchase land near the Eighteen Hua Wharf in Pudong for his burial. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau recently planned to purchase land in Pudong to establish a public cemetery. Chen Atang's uncle secretly sold the tomb without permission. The tomb will be destroyed soon. Chen Song, Atang's wife, was extremely sad and angry when she heard the news. She has been running around and crying out for days, appealing to the representatives of the various groups that provided assistance last time to provide remedies. Tong Lizhang, a member of the former Wu Kaisheng Lawyer's Office, agreed to send a letter to groups such as the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, asking them to forward a letter to the Municipal Health Bureau, requesting that Chen Atang's tomb be preserved to retain diplomatic relics.</p>

<p>Lu Miaolang, a native of Lishui, was 19 years old. He was studying at the Yu Da Distillery in Gongyi Lane, Zhabei. He had completed his apprenticeship. However, he liked to swim. Because it was hot recently, he often went to the new garbage bridge every afternoon to jump into Suzhou Creek to show off his skills. At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, he used the same trick again. Unexpectedly, a boat passed by, causing him to go under the boat, resulting in his drowning. It was not until night that the body was discovered. Yesterday, Shen Qishan, the ward head of the Tenth Ward, reported the matter to the Local Court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Young Woman Sues to Recover Shared Property <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the young woman Wang Qiuquan hired Jin Yu and Li Yuan, two lawyers, to represent her in filing a criminal lawsuit with the French Concession Public Concession against her brother Wang Ruixin and Zheng Yutian for colluding to embezzle the estate of her deceased father and requesting investigation, etc. The lawsuit is recorded as follows: For embezzling shared property, a private prosecution is filed according to law, requesting strict punishment. My deceased father, Wang Youtian, opened the Yongfengtai Southern Goods Store at the Dongxiaoqiao Caishi Street entrance under your jurisdiction. When starting the business, my uncle, Bosheng, and Dao invested 500 yuan. The second defendant, Zheng Yutian, did not invest, but for the sake of friendship, he obtained a dry stock share. Later, the shares under Bosheng's name were still merged by my deceased father's investment. Therefore, my deceased father held nine-tenths of the total share capital of the store, while the second defendant only held one-tenth. All business facilities and monetary income and expenditure were controlled by my deceased father independently, and the second defendant did not interfere. In addition, my deceased father also opened the Laoyuchang Southern Goods Store in Guanyintang, Lujia, under your jurisdiction, solely with his own funds and also managed it himself. As a result of the deceased father's efforts in operating the two stores, there was an annual surplus. For example, the assets of Yongfengtai alone were no less than 20,000 yuan, and the assets of Laoyuchang were also more than 8,000 yuan. However, after the deceased father passed away, there was a demand for the buildings of the Laoyuchang store, so the first defendant gave up the roof for 1,500 yuan. The store's topping price and working capital were all merged into Yongfengtai. Therefore, Yongfengtai accumulated nearly 30,000 yuan. My deceased father unfortunately passed away in January of this year, and all the property left behind was controlled by the first defendant. The complainant and the first defendant are siblings. Although the complainant is a woman, according to current laws, for all inheritances that began after the National Government took power, women, whether married or unmarried, have the right to inherit property, and the method of analysis has also been stipulated, and the number of children is equally divided. This situation is not only clearly defined by law, but also undisputed by the first defendant. It is expected that although the first defendant outwardly acknowledges the right of the complainant to inherit the deceased father's estate, he secretly destroys all untraceable movable property, such as deposits and goods, and debts owed to others. The complainant believed that the first defendant had such intentions, so she commissioned a lawyer to send a letter requesting an analysis. Unexpectedly, he was ridiculed by empty words. The first defendant colluded with the second defendant to publish a statement in the newspaper about the career that the deceased father had worked hard to create throughout his life, falsely claiming that the six shares under the deceased father's name had been merged with the second defendant and renamed Yongfengtai Yiji to continue operating. As for the descendants of the Wang family, there is no relationship. According to the original lawsuit report, Yongfengtai's capital was nine-tenths owned by the deceased father and is all fictional. How could the defendant be even more afraid that the complainant would sue in the location of the store? Later, he published a statement in the newspaper, falsely claiming that the store had been handed over clearly and had now returned to his home in Nanxiang to make the complainant feel difficult. The scheming of the defendants is extremely cunning. I respectfully check that regardless of the assets of Yongfengtai, the number of shares in the deceased father's name, it can be ignored. It is undeniable that it is the property shared by the defendants and the complainant. Now, the defendants published in the newspaper without legal procedures, falsely merging the claims, and without the permission of the co-owners. The signs of their actions have clearly violated Article 356, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. The second defendant's helping act should also be regarded as the principal offender in accordance with Article 42 of the Criminal Code. The complainant has filed a separate lawsuit requesting an incidental civil action. I request that the case be submitted for investigation, etc. Yesterday, when summoned for questioning, the defendant Wang Ruixin was represented by lawyer Zhu Shuzhen, and Zheng Yutian was represented by lawyer Zhou Xiaoan. Both unanimously objected to the plaintiff's claim that the jurisdiction was wrong. In addition, this case is a civil lawsuit in nature and should not be criminally accused. The official ordered him to leave and wait for a later date for continued questioning.</p>

<p>One Dead, One Alive</p>
<p>(1) Yesterday morning at 1:20 AM, an unidentified middle-aged man jumped into the Suzhou Creek from the Baidu Bridge. At the time, Water Patrol Officer No. 14 of the Customs was patrolling under the Zha Pu Road Bridge. He saw the man from afar and rushed to rescue him. Only a soft black-edged whip and a white straw hat were not sinking with him, so he caught them floating on the water surface. The officer immediately retrieved them and waited for a long time, but the man did not reappear. He then went to the Baidu Bridge to inquire with people cooling off, who claimed that the man who jumped into the river was wearing a black Indian silk long gown, was about thirty years old, but nothing else was known. The reason for his suicide was even more unclear. The officer, unable to get any useful information, took the dead man's hat back to the police station to wait for family members to identify it. (2) The day before yesterday at 5:40 PM, a middle-aged man jumped into the Suzhou Creek from the Zha Pu Road Bridge. At the time, detectives Ge Changsheng and Cheng Yongnian of the Customs Water Patrol were passing by on a motorboat on official business. Seeing this, they immediately tried to rescue the man, whose legs were paralyzed, making it difficult for him to move. The two detectives took him to the police station. He confessed that his name was Song Zhengda, 33 years old, from the Tangxi area of Hangzhou. He usually made a living as a peddler. Due to illness for many days, both legs became paralyzed and he could not walk, making it difficult to resume his old job. As a result, he had spent all his savings. He wanted to return home, but had no money for the journey, so he sought death. Upon hearing this, the detectives and other officers contributed a total of four dollars and forty cents in silver and eight cents in small coins, which were sent to the Dai Shenchang Steamship Company's Da'an small steamer at 2:00 PM yesterday to return him to his hometown.</p>

The officer took the child to the Songshan Road Police Station to wait for family members to identify her. There are also families whose children are missing and who have requested the police station and public security bureau to investigate, as follows: (1) The Zeng family, who lives at No. 3 Pingyuan Lane, Rue Père Huc, Jiaxi Yi Road, lost a three-year-old boy named Zeng Senzi.

<p>The number of Western-style leather suitcases and trunks exported to Europe and the United States each year reaches two to three million. However, according to past achievements, there has been little progress. Tracing its origin, the manufacturing business is entirely entrusted to ignorant workers, who adhere to old methods and do not engage in research. This is why it has remained stagnant for so long. Now, Mr. Zhou Fuzhang, a merchant dealing in both Western medicine and leather goods, realizing this, and together with his younger brother and friends, established the Continental Leather Suitcase and Trunk Factory on East-West Huade Road. They hired top technicians, selected high-quality cowhide and raw materials, and supervised the manufacture of various sizes of leather suitcases, trunks, Western-style and joint boxes, camphor wood boxes, and travel-friendly light suitcases, all of which are readily available. Now, a general distribution center has been established at the intersection of Yingda Road and Xizang Road, and the grand opening was held on June 26 (yesterday), with a special discount for seven days.</p>

Zheng Jiuyuan was elected chairman. The chairman reported that since the appointment of the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, he had been soliciting bids everywhere. All tax collection offices in Shanghai were still contracted by merchants, who were required to pay a fixed amount and deposit money. This was nominally a government takeover, but in reality, it was still contracting. It was unanimously decided to jointly publish a denial with the sorghum liquor trade union. If the government did not implement the takeover, they would expose the inside story in the future and appeal to the higher authorities.</p>

<p>— Hong Lian</p>
<p>The members of the Pingying Society are all modern youths. Several genuine youths, living in this era, as long as your sensitivity has not been lost and your perception has not become numb, who would not feel a sense of youth's sorrow? The Pingying Society has this point. They publish "Pingying" every month, a small newspaper that reveals their genuine emotions. They cannot stand the ugliness of society and cannot bear the depression in their hearts. They express all the true emotions in their hearts that can be cursed.</p>
<p>Time is constantly advancing like flowing water, and the affairs of the Pingying Society are also advancing with the times. However, because the members of the organization are mostly middle school students, the society's finances are inevitably hit during the consumption period and they are constantly struggling in a difficult state. However, hot blood is boiling in their bodies. They are not discouraged by economic constraints, and they still hold the organization's purpose and move forward vigorously. Recently, there has been talk of establishing the Pingying Summer Research Society.</p>
<p>During last year's summer, they held the first summer research society, and the results were remarkable. People in Meilong all praised their great spirit and the encouraging potential of their school management skills. This year's summer will see the second summer research society, which is expected to surpass last year's. Currently, President Mei Hongying, Academic Director Mei Yonggeng, General Affairs Director Wang Linxu, and several others are preparing, and the preparations are largely complete. It has been decided that classes will begin on July 6th.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Pingying Summer Research Society is to use the summer vacation to conduct research in various academic fields, learn from each other, and strive for progress. It is divided into three levels: senior primary school first grade, second grade, and remedial classes. Each class has 40 to 50 students. The subjects are divided into four categories: Chinese, English, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge. The duration is five weeks. The society's address is still located at the Meilong Primary School in Meilong Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The instructors are all members of the society.</p>
<p>The society holds a reading guidance weekly meeting every Saturday, where the president invites members to give weekly lectures in rotation, guiding reading methods, etc., and invites local celebrities to lecture on various topics to provide detailed guidance. Now, I wish them all the best in their efforts.</p>
