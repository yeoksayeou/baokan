<p>時評</p>
<h3>中美南美之革命與美國</h3>
<p>中美尼加拉圭與宏都拉斯兩邦。革命之內亂方張。而南美巴拉圭邦。復以革命傳矣。且巴拉圭之革命軍。其進行甚速。其前鋒隊距京城。已在百公里之內。不日即將與政府軍激戰。又如中美宏都拉斯之革命。前傳僅在海濱諸地。與京城有山嶺之隔。今聞其進行亦甚速。據革命軍言。在二十四小時內。即可進佔京城。又聞宏都拉斯之革命。得尼加拉圭革命黨首領之助。其目的乃在反對美國之勢力云。</p>
<p>反觀華盛頓所傳消息。美總統胡佛氏。對於新聞記者發表對於尼加拉圭革命黨領袖申斥之言。謂彼已亡命墨西哥。復指揮黨徒。屠殺美僑八人。實屬自居於文明禮法之外。非嚴懲不可云云。並聞美軍將助尼政府軍自空中攻擊叛軍。由此兩方面以觀。美國對於美洲各國之革命。不免有多所牽涉焉。</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<p>特載</p>
<h3>重申兒童本位的意義</h3>
<p>— 鄭宗海</p>
<p>教育上自教材中心、轉移到兒童中心、這是教育上的大革命、也是盧騷以來教育思潮中心的所在、</p>
<p>首張革命的旗幟的、便是盧騷、他勸我們、要看重兒童他說、「你以爲你知道時間的寶貴、生怕浪費了他、但是你沒有想到如果使用得不當、比較索性讓他過去、還來得好些、一個兒童、沒有教的得當、比較一個人沒有學到一點的、離開美善的境界更加遠了、你怕見他虛度他幼年的光陰、怎麼精神快樂、終日奔跑跳躍、是虛度了麼、他終身是不會再這樣地快樂了、假如有個人不肯睡覺、以爲否則要浪費他生命的一部、你以這人爲何如呢、」</p>
<p>到了十九世紀、裴斯德洛齊福祿培爾等益揚其波、兒童心理研究者、又供給了我們不少的材料、使我們益加明瞭兒童各時期的現象、最近百年來小學教育本身內容上的改進、可說是這個槪念的賜與、所以亞丹姆斯說、近世教育學說最大的貢獻是在發現了兒童、是在拿兒童來當作教育的中心、</p>
<p>這個槪念影響我們對於教育的看法、尤其影響到教育方法、以教材爲中心、教育便是外鑠、易於有定型、以兒童爲中心、教育係是發展、保守的意義較少而進步的精神較多、凡所謂「自動」、所謂「興趣」、所謂「個別適應」等、都是本此而來的、</p>
<p>但是一個人不能離環境而獨立、我們的適應、有時也不能純粹以我爲主、而且要想肆應適宜、也不容不采取或參考現社會已有的成法、所以教材當然是要注意的、所謂「兒童中心」、並非不顧教材、而且完全離了教材、發展的取義、也便失了依據、所以兒童本位云云、祇是一種側重的看法、（參觀拙譯杜威原著兒童與教材、中華書局出版）復次「兒童本位」决非放任的意思、更非姑息的意思、教育者自當有一種遠大的見解、不過成人│尤其是父母│却很要留心、勿「揠苗助長」、須防「欲速不達」、一方仍當本兒童時代的需要與其固有的能量、充厚其生活以發展才能、拉葛氏說「兒童中心學校」應注重兩事、一爲環境的了解、一爲自我的表現、杜威說「發展重在使兒童對於幾種足以代表的少數境况、爲深厚的認識、以漸知所以應付經騐的問題、而不在知識的積累、」這樣、所以注意的逐漸延長、觀察的精確、記憶與思想應有方法的練習、│尤其是求知興味的保持與發展是很重要的、去年杜威在新共和國雜誌裏說、如果新教育不重理知方面的發展、那末新教育便是失敗、</p>
<p>所以兒童本位教育、不但要兒童生活的快樂、并且他要謀兒童生活的效果、當然、兒童生活的快樂也、不能不顧到的、桑戴克說、「其實、如其我們脫落了成人的傾向、但謀成人利益和便利、又想到給兒童天眞爛漫的快樂、是多麼惠而不費的一回事、再想到兒童的好惡常常足爲（自然不一定是）他後來幸福的嚮導、其可靠不比我們的專斷爲少、那末我們便不應把當前的快樂視爲學校教育的一椿小事呀、」他意、杜威教育即生活的一個說素、要「人從生到死各個時間裏、都能快樂地有益地生活、」這「不是對於兒童溺愛的態度、而是純本冷靜的觀察、知道這才是達到人生各種最高遠目的頂好的方法」、</p>
<p>中國國民黨政綱對內政策第十三條、有「以全力發展兒童本位的教育」之一語、從事小學教育者、對此洵不可不有深切的認識、并且要把這個意義推行於家庭才好、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>

<p>戀愛金錢。是人生的燃料。燃料的供給一斷。生命之燄立熄。</p>
<p>結婚以前。戀愛的滋味。酕醄似醇醪。結婚以後。戀愛的滋味。澀苦似紅茶。</p>
<p>怡紅公子說。『女子是水做的。男子是泥做的。』所以男子一遇女子。便如泥牛落水了。</p>
<p>未結合的女子。眞如神聖不可侵犯一般。旣結合的女子。不過如此罷了。所謂偉人也者。亦復如是</p>
<p>交友之道。澹則有味。愛情亦然。愈澹則愈久而有味。</p>
<p>愛夫之情。惟愛子之情。足以减少之。故世上慈母多於賢妻。</p>
<p>妒是女子愛情的昇華。</p>
<p>兩性的戀愛。譬如異性電流之銜接。宜時增其蓄電池之電力。始得以維持戀愛的火花。</p>

<h3>記西湖舟子徐幼蓀</h3>
<p>— 朱瘦狂</p>
<p>「立定脚跟。背後山頭飛不去。執持手印。眼前佛面即如來。」此西湖雲林寺新建梵宇中佳聯也。余靈隱遊罷。步至岳墳。乘遊艇歸來。操舟老人徐幼蓀。自言五十八歲。籍崇德。有田四十畝。耕食無虞不給。兩女已嫁。一子能繼承其業。且抱孫矣。幼蓀每歲二月來杭。業操舟。迨八月下旬則返里。優遊卒歲。在杭操舟所入。每日除酒食半元外。尙有盈餘。足爲平時挹注。故逍遙湖上。怡如也。余謂爾旣有薄產。不虞衣食。望六之年。而猶業此。母乃辛苦乎。幼蓀笑曰。先生謂吾辛苦乎。吾正樂此不疲也。夫西湖風景甲天下。南自百粵。北達燕冀。富商達官。年耗鉅金。來遊斯土。然旅居亦暫耳。而吾則不費一文。朝夕置身於湖光山色中。一槳輕蕩。嘯傲自得。日作夜息。一秉自主。不求人。不愁食。吾實爲消遣而事職業。非爲餬口而謀生計也。吾業此有三不划。一大風。二雨雪。三則凡朔望侵晨。縱啗吾重價不划也。蓋風雨則多險而辛勞。値朔望則吾無論晴雨。必朝天竺觀音大士也。馬寅初先生嘗坐吾艇。與談甚洽。吾不審經濟學爲何物。第知量入爲出。不積資。不浪費。天地本逆旅。人生須知足。天賜吾老而未衰之軀。得樂吾所樂。夫復何憾乎。昨歲有餘資。乃費百金。料理身後事。一旦寂滅。得有歸宿。此後吾一身閒散。了無罣礙。有生之年。無非快樂之日也。言至斯。舟已抵岸。幼蓀受資道謝。輕舟一槳。又盪入烟波深處。余歸寓。憶及梵宇聯語曁舟子所言。不禁惘然者累日。</p>

<p>近三五年來。先兄覺迷。因侍奉先慈病。久居鄕間。侍奉湯藥外。專致力於看書。蓋先大父先王父。均不治田畝。宦游與硯田所得。悉以購置書籍。所以繼祖志也。家庋藏書。雖不足云萬卷書。然佔屋已五楹矣。覺迷日坐書城。固優遊自樂。無愁寂寞。文筆之日進。著述之日多者。皆得力於小小之書室焉。凡所著述之發表於鉛梓者。已指不勝屈。而於考據上。更覺有研究之心得。蓋予家雖絕少精槧孤本。然各省志乘。固累累也。茲檢其遺稿。似覺稍具著述價値者。約有二十餘種。囿於力弱。均未付梓也。特略述一二以告。其關於歷史上者。有上海外交史。洋涇浜章程釋義。各地租界沿革史。開鑿吳淞江源流考。淸代邊防雜錄等六種。上海外交史一稿。茲已交外交署葉慕橘先生保存。關於考據上者。有歷代紀年正誤。長江流域古跡考證。曲阜聖跡詳考。江湖百戲。是書詳述秦漢以來。三教九流之起源與應騐。並繋以各著名者之小傳。又有上海古墓考證誌。各收藏家之性別小誌。古硯銘刻雜錄等七種。關於雜輯者。有浦左杜氏詩鈔兩卷。是書爲海上聞人杜月笙先生先德遺著。惟皆散見各家詩集。或鈔本之中。窮經年之力以輯成者。茲已交呈月笙先生保藏。又有筆記選存六卷。曝書雜記等若干種。所謂曝書雜記者。係逐日整理家庋書籍之日記。爲完竣後編撰書目張本。其餘之斷篇殘稿。不一而足。予擬略加整頓。擇尤付梓。上海國文家李右之姊丈。已允任編次。並將所遺短文片稿。歸併一起。題爲覺迷叢刋以行世。蓋覺迷一身心血所聚。任令散失。不無可惜。而家藏書籍之未曾整理者。予擬於暑期中。作有統系之處理。予友陳子葆藩。曾任儉德儲蓄會圖書館長。對於書目編制。有相當之心得。茲又允予之請。助予整理。並以完成曝書雜記一稿。予雖不肖。對於家藏古籍。當然盡維力保藏之責。否則先人遺澤。散失盡矣。覺迷有知。亦可無憾於九原也。</p>
<h3>觀試映人獸奇觀後</h3>
<p>— 余開煦</p>
<p>日前蒙卡爾登諸執事召。赴大光明觀「人獸奇觀」之預映。初未知該片之內容。以爲不過與前數次狩獵攝影諸片相等之作材。蓋余對於前數片。類皆等閒視之也。後聞曾讀其書者言。此片中頗有令人心悸之處。蓋是片之攝製。完全根據菲洲實况。非面壁臆造者可比。迨銀幕開映。則知此片之成。固爲菲洲各殖民政府大探險家大游獵家之所合力製成。蓋不如此。亦不能成是片之偉大。而將淪於平常馬戲塲中之兒戲矣。再言此片犧牲之巨。則除獅犀虎豹等野獸之死傷外。厥惟人類生命之犧牲。有堆積如山之人頭。有半腐之人尸。即非專爲此片之攝。而故爲殘忍非人道之舉動。要皆自菲洲食人國內冒險攝來。其餘如獅豹之獵食。羣獅之爭鬥等等。亦决非虛構。觀之除震骸及不忍外。確可知菲洲荒林中之實况。至其最偉之犧牲。則如一黑人爲犀所殺。犀爲獸中之最兇猛者。當之者無不立斃。又一巨獅。爲一黑人以一長及丈許之尖棍。挿入腦中。該獅吼聲如雷。狂躍三四次。即倒地而斃。其餘如菲洲之食人國。每四出獵取人頭。擊鼓喧天。喊聲震地。但聞其聲。即可膽戰心驚。再則食人國中。有女酋一。美麗無比。其先人蓋亦白人而陷於食人國者。後終爲白人拯之出。斯則作者不能不有此穿挿。蓋不如此。此片將失却精神之調劑。而在記者本人則旣有美艷無雙。妙曼天成。肩垂黃髪。玉體苗條之野女當前。足使我歷久不忘。而觀此片之後。至今尚覺一切之一切。歷歷在目也。</p>
<h3>像讚</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>每一訃文之首。必冠以像。像必有讚。讚必煌煌當代諸大人物。署名題撰。其實際還是幾個寒酸。拈髭搦管。做枯窘題。如來所謂苦趣。予亦飽嘗此苦趣之一份子。久之而省悟所作之誤。誤在文不對題。試檢視諸作。皆是傳讚。非像讚也。旣名像讚。只合讚其像。於是像讚界起大革命。而得一新紀元之像讚如下。</p>
<p>讚公之頭。形如栲栳。鑽如錐尖。磕曾蒜搗。讚公之目。膀子會吊。量不小則眼皮淺。胸不正則眸子眊。讚公之鼻。兩孔天撩。香臭不知。楊梅酒糟。讚公之口。如相聲呌。大盆之血可張。三寸之舌不掉。掬喙則八戒爲猪。閉嘴則李逵稱鳥。讚公之耳。不通一竅。大而豎兮兎兒爺。小而搐兮鼠子耗。似此犖犖五官。不亦斑斑可考乎。原夫古拙。像惟石造。今則靈便。影攝鏡照。放固可大。縮又能小。生片都有幾張。死訃必來這套。已足紀念。已爲盡孝。胡爲乎。做不對題之文。戴不合頭之帽。多無味之恭維。來有識之譏誚。如使死而有知。見之必嚇一跳。是以荀卿著爲非相。澹臺失之取貌。七嘴八舌。十麻九俏。酒渦媚而額生。睫毫柔而頰繞。和尙發怒則模樣惡。皇帝被斫則頸項好。紅頭之審美阿三。粉面之雙料曹操。有何地靈人傑。直是天生不肖。而况頭獐目鼠。鼻鷹眼鷂。妍皮媸骨。肥腸滿腦。筋不束骨。是曰鬼躁。內荏厲色。穿窬之盜。耳吃記而有光。臉不要而時掃。有瘟必遭。無厭不討。製糞則完全機器。渾蛋則倒文貝寶。四脚朝天。辮子必蹺。一口之氣不來。三人之視相笑。嗚呼哀哉。如何不早。</p>
<p>短訊　粵中名歌舞家紫羅蘭女士。此次重來海上獻藝。博得觀衆贊美。女士又作津平之遊。昨接友人李子元興。自平來函。據云北平城南遊藝園。特聘女士登台表演。如天女散花。寶蓮燈。武家坡。樓東怨。半邊鷄。八股佬教女。摘花女。小靑弔影。禪房夜怨。霍小玉。蘇州小曲。足尖舞。紫羅蘭舞等。無不工妙絕倫。故新聞界捧之甚力云。（芮鴻初）</p>
<h3>太保阿書正法瑣記（下）</h3>
<p>— 竹天</p>
<p>十元治裝　此次在滬所僱之劊子手王福生及助手三人。在孫傳芳時代專理此業。近年來斬刑廢止。王等亦流落滬上。生活維艱。此次被召。喜出望外。但以衣衫襤褸。索治裝費。當給以每人十元。各購黑色夾衣褲一套。剃頭沐浴。煥然一新。總計此次每人所獲平均在二三十元。亦足敷月餘之生活矣。</p>
<p>寄與兒輩　太保阿書自起解迄就刑。念念不忘者厥爲其所遺之兩子。向例罪犯就刑時所穿之衣服均爲劊子手所有。但當時發綁時。太保阿書所穿之藍縐棉袍。及藍華絲葛夾襖褲一套。所値尙巨。因囑士兵可將衣服典質所得。寄與兩子。暫作救濟。聞者唯唯。但兩子住址不明。無從寄與。當然仍爲劊子手之囊中物。死者有知。當不無耿耿也。</p>
<p>稱奉上命　太保阿書弟兄至法塲後。劊子手王福生及助手等已先在。所持刀爲大刀隊所用者。刀鋒新磨。光可鑒人。太保阿書弟兄相背跪。太保先就刑。其弟次之。先後不及三分鐘。刑時。一人持太保之雙手向後拉。口稱奉上命。無關己事。另一人持繩套太保頸項。向前拉。亦稱奉上命。最後劊子手近前。撫太保之腹部。亦稱奉上命殺你。請勿怨我。然後以手略按太保之頸項。右手握刀藏身後。至是持太保雙手者大喊一聲。剎那間劊子手已手起刀落。連斬數刀。人頭落地。時太保之弟雖目睹其兄之死。神色仍不變。可謂極人間之慘事。</p>
<p>血錢辟邪　向例刑後足鐐例應敲斷。太保阿書弟兄之足鐐重約七斤。頭斷後。劊子手持刀柄將足鐐敲斷。而太保之弟徐福生。因敲時不愼。傷足。襪外血漬殷然。又刑後觀衆各出制錢。錢孔懸以短繩。持繩向斷腔中蘸血。云可壓邪。鄭重包以白紙。納入囊中。有遠道來觀之婦女。竟以數元之代價。購求此壓邪之制錢。其愚殊不可及也。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（三二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>印人身體長大。其所售之旅行床。較中國者約長八寸。可證明。髪黑。異於歐人然眼深鼻高。異於東方。而同於歐人。不過其鼻不若白人之尖耳。其同爲亞利安人之證也。據印人言。其初來自帕米爾地方恒河上游。本名婆羅門人。至印度土人。本自有之。乃文化最低之原人。今尙保存。小部在山林中云。此殆與中國人之有苗民。日本之有蝦夷人同耳。</p>
<p>印男人髪大抵已剪者多。而下等社會最有趣者。只留最小之一小部於頭頂。又數十根。如吾國小兒之辮焉。女人亦有剪髪者。穿鼻之俗依然。最不雅也。</p>
<p>印人舉動。有一種表示。吾人每易誤會。則其搖頭之俗。若吾人以爲然。則點頭道是。以爲否。則搖頭。印人反是。其搖頭也。表示贊成。余每誤會。或不能明了。久乃漸知之。然仍不慣也。</p>
<p>十七日。余偶過一地。飢渴甚。見一點心店。就食。井坐而飲冷水。彼與余一土杯。飲之。其點心甚美。食已。彼命余携其點心之餘而歸。不然。須棄之於街。又命余將土杯擲之於街而碎之。余不甚解。堅問之。確乃擲而碎之棄之。殊大詫異。此奇俗也。杯只許用一次。點心不許剩餘。究係何故。記日本有此俗。其用筷子之法。每飯必用新者。其筷爲楊木所製。甚輕鬆易壞。如用牙籖然。但以余閱歷。亦大飯店擺闊耳。余常住小貸家。觀其主人並不如此。何以印人之土杯只飲一次水。不用第二次也。余問之紳士。答曰。此印度教也。蓋爲衛生起見。生人所用過之杯。不能亂用。故棄之。生人所餘之食物。不敢食。故棄之。因習慣不同。或有傳染病。故至人之家。不敢輕進飲食也。余按此等大致由宗教家暗示。排斥他教之故。只增加社會忌諱與障碍。若眞爲衛生。敢斷定其不然也。忌諱多。不敢與人接觸。不適於今之世矣。余乃悟何以南洋各國民族。數千年不能同化者。由各教各族之忌諱使然也。今者五洲大同。必有掃盪芟夷之一日。豈容此等陋俗存在乎。入鄕問俗。亦令吾人手足無所擔也。總之印度風俗。令吾人如墮五里霧中。甚難解矣。</p>

<p>晨市按步而進　自晨六月份開盤即降一兩半、爲七百十八兩半、因大條祗跌十六分之一、銀價低八分之一、私電亦然、且歐市極平、旋後乾昌祥昌升永等買進、即行上升、計漲七兩餘、惟有一兩之高下、且以英金猶堅、各行曾售出一三半、繼而同價吃進、故九點二十分爲二十六兩、時由元茂永等售出、並由三井賣六七月英金一三半、遂已抑小二兩、迨先令揭佈不更、時爲二十四兩二錢、入後英金僅結四三七五至三七五、良以信亨萃昌永餘大義豐永源成等相繼而購、致漲至六兩、至十點時英金忽掛縮一二五、美金二五、日金加一分二五、頓已漲至三十一兩、俄而萬興順利福昌等賣出、十點十一分爲二十九兩、片刻即高至三十一兩半、乃天豐永大興永等買進、旋後福昌元亨萬興等續賣不已、乃扖進英金而套出條子焉、至十點半爲二十八兩、往後源成恒餘天裕永等猛爲購進、故風雲會集、復向上騰、重又穿出三十兩大關、尤聞美國有倒閉英商銀行之風說、矧英金曾由住友正金匯豐等售出三一二五、乃金價再漲四五兩、至十一點一刻爲三十五兩、繼由志豐永福昌順利等賣出、已銳降四兩、午刻爲三十一兩、迨收盤三十二兩、以後續又抬高兩許、揭價初爲七百六十五兩、計撳四十兩至三十五兩、後改爲七百七十一兩、計抑四十兩至二十六七兩、午時四十兩之諮</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市平淡無神</p>
<p>紗市仍萎、蓋以海花紗狀况又轉下游、因之人心軟化、賣方壓力尤重、大數散戶拋空、心思異常濃厚、以時期漸覺落零、而粗紗生意呆滯、所以逢漲必賣、市勢暫被逼迫、然實銷四川帮以戰事可告平靜、採辦隨之而起、今則四去一二千包、而金價亦見騰高、故大戶態度仍靜、毫無放手之念、紗市照大勢論之、當有立定可能性、惟四圍環境不良、難以向榮、前途恐有極大變動、</p>

<h3>棉市小挫</h3>
<p>棉市略疲、因美印兩棉趨勢又跌、致人心散淡、市况遂疲、但日商態度仍然强昂、不肯放鬆、而金價又轉上峯、所以有多數皆不敢貿然拋空、以底貨太枯也、惟現棉生意岑寂、前途仍依匯兌及美棉爲進退也云、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>天晴米市轉疲</p>
<p>閘北　昨各帮來船二十號左右、市銷自天宮轉晴後、人心見弱、北帮高白粳因趨萎疲之態、中次各粳悉軟角外、統市交易淸淡、市又不振、薄稻買氣平庸、到存不厚、市稍微削、羊杜秈埠秈情勢忽呈呆定之局、買方殊不注意、故成交不多、白元到銷兩敵、仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日河下見到十餘號、本街銷化轉滯、常蘇各粳在晨初尙挺、旋乃轉平、至收市際因去路益呆、有帶疲之象、南帮薄早稻頂貨頗俏、普通不爽、大勢高堅次定、羊杜等尖客帮胃淡零拆亦屬平常、價鮮上落、變元陰化此間呈到稀銷懈之態、除高貨活動價平外、餘則略有修降、大市陰化祇開九元六七角耳、</p>
<h3>客秈市極端淸寂</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、淸淡異常、因廣帮停辦、其他本客均無胃口、存貨尙有少數江西米、到頭除行廠自辦車貨外、客販多不問聞、江西米存底不多、貨主頗有居奇之意、但貨少難選、客帮觀望、行情終難望漲也、全日祇有北洋帮辦去江西中關機元五十餘包、價十三元、其他均無交易、但本客對於客元胃口仍佳、祇嫌存少與貨次、不克盡興裝辦云、</p>
<h3>期麥市初平繼萎</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼跌之象、本月份初開尙佳、繼以本月份之解貨方面、雖一部份因到貨未能合格、均已抽回、但有幾家、則己向說妥、將標準互相軋去、因此之故、浮多方面、似不能與空方相抗、故一回再回、較之前日收盤、竟落七分之巨、遠期各月份、初則穩定、迨後以天時晴暢、兼因行家之套售、市氣亦呈萎靡、觀察後步、或者尙須平疲也、結果本月份較前日跌七分、五六月份跌五分、七月份跌六分、八月份跌五分、九月份跌三分云、</p>
<h3>標粉市難脫疲境</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初疲繼俏之勢、因洋麥報佳、互有一二角之上落、而較大之衝動、則以前日驟雨、昨則放晴、一部份之人心、未免因天雨而轉變、故開盤時曾小去近分、迨後投機浮多、又復活動、故近遠期仍復回穩、及下午開盤、以天津帮之進胃、仍未發動、兼之該處之現粉又小一分、（三元零九分）所以人心大致疲滯、觀後步恐以環境重趨不佳、遠期回到二兩關口、亦未可知也、結果本月份較前日小七厘半、五月小一分、六月至九月小一分二厘半</p>
<h3>期豆午後趨軟</h3>
<p>昨日大連標準黃豆初開極佳、近遠各月期有客帮與廠家問津、故本月份曾到四兩七錢、緣刻下交易所成交有一千數百車之鉅、雖有大連午莊營口等處運來、然因防貨次不能及格關係、致人心極奸也、迨至午後開盤、連電到申報小九分、於是市氣轉軟、價乃由堅而趨疲、結果計四月期四兩六錢八分、六月期四兩六錢六分、均反小一分、五月期則無上落、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>劃盤跟外匯逐升</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價未變更、紐約期糖僅九月份不動、餘月份各逐跌一分、爪哇現期糖亦仍無升降、公會市塲劃盤、以外滙步昂、人氣愈堅、市又逐升、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價至十兩0五錢、雖交易不多、市尙堅定、二十號中砂白市亦跟漲至十兩、日糖交易甚活、價亦步升、YT嘜十兩0四錢二分半、YRO嘜九兩九錢半、明華貨九兩九錢二分半、J嘜十兩0九錢YP嘜十兩零八錢半、J嘜X十兩0七錢、TM嘜十兩0一錢半、市形均挺秀、日糖廠盤橫濱糖回電已轉、價升五分、額計兩共二萬包、旦月份興行方進意未合、尙未成交、聞照前盤交貨、日期改作五六月份、惟仍須回電如何可定奪云、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>洋莊絲銷難以轉機</p>
<p>本埠洋莊絲市、仍乏轉機之可能、緣海外華絲廠銷依然呆滯、電轉價小、華商本重、虧折太巨、絲銷難暢、昨衹和興等進滬白廠經三十包、安利進黃廠經十包、百利進黃粗絲十五包、價均平疲</p>
<h3>油市</h3>
<p>秀桐油逐漸有到</p>
<p>秀桐油盛銷於夏秋、而春季所謂備貨、銷塲亦不减盛夏、今春因上冬存底單薄、需貨者咸延頸而望、惟產地遠在湘南、轉運需時、溯自開春以來、漢滬兩地均有中斷之虞、直至半月前始有一批由漢運到、約數百桶、聞其總數在二三千、絡繹皆可抵埠、所到之牌號、爲萬興裕·震泰亨·集豐恒·集泰恒·集盛恒·集慶恒等、尙有大有恒一牌、因產額祇數百桶、須後批出運、不知何日可到矣、客盤已開計萬興裕二十八兩八錢、震泰亨集豐恒二十八兩四錢、餘者按牌而降、到貨不多、求過於供、不數日間已銷售一空矣、</p>

<h3>華陽觸礁續訊</h3>
<p>船體似無挽救希望</p>
<p>員客上山安全無恙</p>
<p>今日由成利輪載滬</p>
<p>航安公司華陽輪船在溫州洋海山島遇霧觸礁、已誌昨報、關於該輪之救護情形、經本報記者、向各方面切實查訪、其船員旅客、均於失事後、乘小舢板逃上礁山、故均平安無恙、惟船身則被礁石毀壞已無法拖救矣、茲將詳情分誌如後、</p>
<p>失事眞相　此次華陽船自二十日下午離滬、開赴興化、至二十一日下午二時半、行至溫州洋海山島附近九十海里、地名南魚山暗礁、該輪即遇大霧、船主爲俄人沙克洛夫、W.Sokoloff擬拋錨暫避但已不及、船身即觸入該山暗礁之上、其損壞程度、來電雖未述及、然照公平來電參觀、似船底已套進礁石、海水冲入各艙、形勢十分危急、失事時間、爲下午二時三十分、</p>
<p>外輪先救　船主發出第一求救電報、爲天祥洋行電廷倍恩克號輪所接到、次由公平輪接得、在二十一日下午四時三十五分、天祥輪即首先開至海山島、進行助救、無如天霧過大、不能前進、遂由該輪發一電報至滬、略稱、華陽離海山島九十里、我們已來救護、惟霧甚大云云、至五時半、公平亦到、惟因吃水太深、無法靠近、霧亦迷漫海面、難放舢板、望洋興嘆、徒呼奈何而已、</p>
<p>船客上山　華陽失事後、船員及旅客、約有一百三十名、經船主及買辦樂堯生等、取給救命衣、並解放舢板船、先將在輪之旅客、分批載運上南魚礁之上、暫行避難、據聞二十一日下午、全船職員乘客、均已安然登山、未傷一人、亦不幸中之大幸也、</p>
<p>擱礁度數　昨日航安公司又接英輪發來電報謂、華陽失事處、在航行警告表三百號、以日度指定、觸礁地在北緯十八度·西經六度云云、下午二時三十五分、又得公平續電、言華陽輪擱礁、地名南魚山、在海山島相近、已無法施救、公平存水缺少、另籌辦法云云、</p>
<p>英輪援助　大英公司郵船拉乾浦得那號、自上海出口赴英、經過溫州洋面、得聞華陽失事訊、亦駛往馬鞍島、帮同救護、係於昨日上午十一時、開抵海山島、先打旗語、問公平輪、由公平船主答復、謂華陽船員搭客已全部救上南魚山、公司已另派船來救護矣、</p>
<p>兩船往救　昨日上午、航安公司、因得公平電告、該輪缺乏食水飲料、不能救護、遂請本埠順安輪公司發電、與同航線內之福生號輪、駛往救護、其時福生輪已由興化返、業到吳淞、未曾進口、便即折赴南魚山、同時又向政記公司磋商、請電令現在溫州洋之成利號輪、就近駛往助救、該兩船派出以後、至下午二時五十三分、得公平輪續來一電、謂本輪因爐水缺乏、不能久停、先行開回上海、大英郵船已到華陽出事處、停泊保護、成利號輪於下午三時可到、福生尙未駛到、在山之船員旅客、將由成利輪放舢板駁救上船、開回上海矣、</p>
<p>派艦保護　江海關得海岸無線電台通知後、昨晨已派流鯨號軍艦、駛往該處保護、而航安經理黃星閣、爲保護客貨及防海盜刦掠起見、特赴海軍司令部要求派艦、前往保護、海軍當局、已允電飭駐防寗波之永建軍艦、就近駛往翊護該失事輪船矣、</p>
<p>船貨損失　華陽輪先爲王交長所有、今年由航安公司以十萬元購入、先則派行北洋烟津營口、近頃始調走上海興化、尙係購入後方航第三次也、該輪載重一千六百噸、船身係本局自行保險、此次在滬所裝之出口貨、荳子荳餅疋頭生油火油及雜貨等、一千二百噸、聞船身已經破壞、絕無挽救希望、行將拋棄、公司方面、據其負責人員言、首先將船員旅客救回、次則駁卸貨物、以冀保全商帮之血本云云、船員之行李物件、及旅客之財物等、均不及携出、亦皆完全犧牲、故此次華陽失事、雖未傷害人命、而公私損失、亦甚巨大、至於被難人員、今日可望救回上海矣、</p>

<h3>油畫與新錄</h3>
<p>— 山本鼎著　陳抱一譯</p>
<p>用油畫來寫生風景、在我、則覺得綠的景色最難表現、若講到……田野、山丘都變成一片沉重的綠色、河灘等處、如鉛皮屋頂一般地發亮、樹幹、看起來帶着葡萄色的盛夏、那倒不容易着手、雖則對於那種重厚的、男性的底「自然」、很有所感動、可是、一旦描出來看、結果、只會描成一種平凡的東西、……這却是因爲夏天的景觀中、沒有化裝的緣故、……草木、雖含有饒裕的量（Volume）而呈現出一種雄壯的美、但是、色彩和濃淡之變化、却不能與春秋相比、這一點、是與冬天一致的、所以、夏天和冬天、倒要想繪「素描」、</p>
<p>若說到新綠、無論如何也覺得以油畫最好、……那種鮮艷的强烈的色彩、豈不是正如剛剛從顏料筒裏擠出來的、Cadmium　Citron（檸檬色鉲黃）、CadmiumCair（淡鉲黃）、Vert　Emeraude（濃綠）、等同樣的色彩嗎、……例如、柿樹的嫩葉、便是於「濃綠」中加混些許「檸檬色鉲黃」的一種色了、……Kaname樹（樹名）的新綠、是於「淡鉲黃」之中混入少許Carance「紅色」的一種色、柯樹之新芽、是於「檸檬色鉲黃」之中以Indian　Yellow「印度黃」加混使略沈晦、而淡薄地加以「藍色」的一種色彩、……落葉松之新綠、是有點兒像葱的、色用綠不如用藍、是仍舊以「檸檬色鉲黃」那些來調合的一種色、凡此等等大抵都是可以直將「調色板」上的顏色、照原用出也不致錯誤的一種……綠色、——而且新綠、是像花一般明麗、——當新綠底季候、泥土、也見得有令人不勝愛悅的美、……竟似牛酪一般柔軟、蛋糕一般鬆、牛肉一般重的、便在白晝、也帶着濕潤、……這種色、又實在是一種很能引誘油畫慾的色、……泥土固然好、但、那時候的天空、亦見佳美、大抵是含帶水色而陰曇着、把柯樹和樟樹之新綠、都顯得皚明如霜、那天空、又却是一種屬於油畫的東西、</p>
<p>但是、描寫新綠的油畫、在近來的展覽會裏、不大有得看見、以前、恐怕也曾有過種種的新綠的畫、但是、能成爲佳評的一種作品、似乎沒有、……我記得確是前年、在朝日新聞社所展覽的泰西名畫之中、曾有一幅Monet（莫納）所作的、描寫榛樹之新綠的大作、……是仍舊以他那種富於彈力的筆致、厚量地堆着明麗的顏料、而表出新鮮的午前的日光、……這幅畫、便在Monet的製作裏面、也可以算爲代表的作品之一、—從大體說、在初期印象派的繪畫裏面、「綠的畫」、倒見很多、如悉士黎（Sisley）等、也曾繪過許多白楊樹和梧桐之新綠、……辟薩羅(Pissarro)所擅長者、是綠的果樹園、……又如累奴亞爾（Renoir）的橄欖樹之林、和塞尙（Cezanne）的松樹……一一想起來、似乎總有不少、悉士黎表現鮮麗的綠蔭之色、却有用葡萄色來點綴的習癖、這個、我覺得似乎反把畫弄成了庸俗不雅的、……在累奴亞爾所繪的橄欖樹底濃綠上面、見有Emeraude　Carance　Bleu（藍）等所混合、而做成像深濃的蠟石那樣的滑面、—塞尙則似乎不用Emerald的、無論何種鮮色、都似乎是用「黃」與「藍」來作成的、而且、在蔭影的部分、也幾乎不見有「紅」的形跡、……大約是用他那種軟毛筆、蘸取了有厚量的顏料、……用筆不挑剔、不滑走、而寗靜地、且絕不加以滅殺、……把Motive（畫因、即所描寫的景象—譯者註）的色彩底交響、確然留宿着於眼中而描寫的、……那幅綠樹的畫、是有眞美極了、</p>
<p>講到日本的作品、在我往昔的記憶裏、則有三宅克己氏的水彩畫、第一次從外國回來當時的三宅君、曾頻繪過好些綠的畫、我記得在我還未做美術學生以前、當時無論那一個、都曾被三宅君的「綠的畫」所魅惑的、石井柏亭君的水彩畫、有一幅題名「新嫩的柿樹」者、也曾博佳評、……山下新太郎君、亦見每年發表所繪的秀美的綠樹林、……至於新近、則先前的春陽會中、梅原龍三郎君曾出品一幅、以大團的綠樹和蔭影作前景「榛名湖」、竟令我追思綠山之淸韻、</p>

<h3>Revolution in Central, South America and the United States</h3>
<p>Nicaragua and Honduras in Central America are experiencing internal strife due to revolutions. Paraguay in South America has also been caught up in a revolution. Moreover, the Paraguayan revolutionary army is advancing rapidly. Its vanguard is within 100 kilometers of the capital and will soon engage in fierce battles with the government forces. Similarly, the revolution in Honduras, Central America, was previously reported to be confined to the coastal areas, separated from the capital by mountains. Now it is said that it is also progressing rapidly. According to the revolutionary army, it can occupy the capital within 24 hours. It is also reported that the Honduran revolution has received assistance from the leader of the Nicaraguan revolutionary party, with the aim of opposing the influence of the United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, news from Washington reports that U.S. President Hoover has publicly reprimanded the leader of the Nicaraguan revolutionary party, stating that he has fled to Mexico and is directing his followers to massacre eight American expatriates, placing himself outside the bounds of civilization and law and demanding severe punishment. It is also reported that the U.S. military will assist the Nicaraguan government forces in attacking the rebels from the air. From these two aspects, it can be seen that the United States is inevitably deeply involved in the revolutions in various American countries.</p>

<p>General Berenguer's Crime Difficult to Pardon</p>
<p>Communist Activities Will Be Strictly Punished</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st - The British Empire and Switzerland have recognized the new Spanish government.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - The German government has announced its official recognition of the new Spain.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 21st - Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux told reporters today that there is no secret treaty between Spain and Italy. If such a secret treaty is found, the republic is willing to tear it up. Spain's foreign policy will not change, except for some activity in the League of Nations. When asked about his strong support for the Allied Powers during World War I, Lerroux said that since he is now a member of the Republican government, there is no such thing as leaning towards Germany or France; in fact, he only leans towards Spain. Moreover, since World War I, his personal attitude towards Germany has changed greatly. Spain is very willing to be friendly with Germany, because the commercial relationship between the two countries is very important. Lerroux also said that the current cabinet will do its best to prevent Alfonso from returning to the country. Lerroux also said that he will personally attend the League of Nations Council meeting in May to meet with politicians from various countries. He is very willing to recognize the Soviet Union as soon as possible and restore all diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 21st - Interior Minister Maura declared today that former Prime Minister General Berenguer will be subjected to extremely severe trials. If he is sentenced to death again, it may be difficult to grant him clemency again as before. The government will also deal with members of the Communist Party with harsh measures, because they are active everywhere. For example, in Saint Sebastian, they attacked the executive committee of the Chamber of Commerce during the Chamber of Commerce election, and the next day they held a parade and demonstration, coercing 20,000 people to resist the Republican government, which should not be tolerated lightly.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 21st - According to talks with key figures in the Provisional Government, the current government's policy includes a plan to organize a federation of thirteen republican states, with Catalan and Galician languages ​​as the national languages ​​along with Spanish. However, Basque language was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st - Deposed King Alfonso of Spain left Paris in his own car this morning for more than four hours, and arrived in Calais in the afternoon. At 3:15, he crossed the sea west to Dover, then boarded a train directly to London. When he arrived at Victoria Station, the crowd welcomed him enthusiastically. Hundreds of police officers blocked the crowd, and fifty detectives were on the scene to investigate, because there had recently been threats to the Spanish King's life. There were no formal greetings for the deposed King's arrival in England. The platform was not decorated as usual, and he was treated only with personal courtesy. When the deposed King arrived at a certain hotel in Clary, Deposed King Manuel of Portugal happened to be in the hotel and came out to welcome him. Alfonso dined alone, and even his closest friends were not allowed to enter the royal room. Only the Duke of Miranda accompanied him. Reuters has learned that the deposed King's visit to England is purely for the purpose of sending his son John to the British Navy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 21st - The Spanish Queen led her children away from a Paris hotel today to Fontainebleau. The Queen and her daughters were weeping as they left, and their situation was touching.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 21st - The Duke of Alba, the most trusted official of the deposed King of Spain, today announced a statement on behalf of the deposed King, saying that the King hopes not to return to Spain. If the country prospers, there is no need to return. He must wait for the call of the people before he can return to the capital. The King is very unwilling to use military assistance to re-enter the Spanish capital, because this move will lead to bloodshed. If Spain achieves strength under the new system, the King will live in a foreign country forever. The King has instructed the imperial faction to work for the country, not to participate in the restoration, and to hope that they will support the Republic to determine the national policy. The Duke of Alba also said that the King's close friends all believe that the King will live abroad permanently, but he will not abdicate before the general election. Whether the King will actually give up the throne if the general election proves the victory of the Republican Party is currently unknown. The main responsibility of the imperial faction is to stay in the country, strive to maintain the Republic, and prevent it from falling into the hands of extremists, causing the country to fall into communism. The rumors that the King has invested millions of dollars abroad are malicious rumors. Most of the King's assets have been invested in Spanish businesses. Even if he is not poor now, he cannot afford to live a luxurious life. The claim that Spain concluded a secret agreement with Italy during the Rivera dictatorship is also not true. The Duke of Alba went to Madrid today to convey the King's intentions to the imperial faction.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 21st - The Madrid Herald published a strange message today, saying that since King Alfonso of Spain left the palace, many valuable objects have been stolen from the palace, such as the crown and documents related to the Moroccan War. The court has now sealed off the palace.</p>

<p>Turmoil Spreads in Honduras and Nicaragua</p>
<p>Revolution Breaks Out in Paraguay</p>
<p>Aimed at Resisting American Influence</p>
<p>Revolutionary Armies Advance on the Capital from All Directions</p>
<p>Like a Hot Knife Through Butter</p>
<p>Associated Press, Asuncion, 21st - While the civil war in Nicaragua and Honduras is ongoing, revolution has broken out in Paraguay. Tonight, the Paraguayan government confirmed that the revolutionary party attempted to overthrow the Liberal Party government. It is reported that the revolutionary army has already occupied Villa Alberdi, across the river from Argentina, and its vanguard is within 100 miles of the capital, engaging in fierce battles with government forces.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Capital of Honduras, 21st - The revolutionary army is advancing very rapidly. The Honduran government is currently getting help from the American embassy staff, doing its best to protect this place from attacks, and has designated a neutral zone outside the capital. It has sent envoys to advise the commander of the revolutionary army, asking him to respect life and property in the neutral zone. According to military experts, a major war is imminent, and the general public, in view of the failure of the government army to stop the revolutionary army from advancing, is deeply worried that the current government will inevitably be overthrown. Revolutionary army organizations claim that they can occupy the capital within 24 hours. Most of the cities in the country have already risen up in response. The transportation lines in the war zone are currently blocked by the revolution, so the military victory or defeat cannot be accurately known. There is a widespread rumor that the revolution in Honduras is secretly supported by General Sandino, the leader of the Nicaraguan revolutionary party, with the aim of opposing American influence, but this has not been confirmed to date.</p>

<p>Tokyo Special Dispatch - Recently, the foundation of our country's unification has been steadily consolidating, and the authorities and people of the Northeast have been unanimously cooperating to carry out various construction projects in order to recover national rights. Railway and shipping projects are being realized step by step. The Japanese are becoming greatly alarmed, and are trying to prevent the unification and construction of our country. Recently, the All Manchuria Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the South Manchuria Railway authorities have advocated the theory of "establishing a Manchurian and Mongolian plan with a supra-party policy." The All Manchuria Chamber of Commerce held a joint conference in Shenyang in September last year, which already had the resolution on this matter. Recently, it convened representatives of Chambers of Commerce and Industry from various places in Dalian to discuss the so-called "Manchurian and Mongolian Management Strategy." The content of this strategy is unknown, but its purpose of aggression is obvious. The Japanese enterprises in various parts of Manchuria are all jointly operated by major financial conglomerates such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Okura. Now, looking at the major shareholders of the South Manchuria Railway Company, they are roughly as follows: Yasuda Conglomerate capital 141,962; Japan Trust capital 37,440; Hara Conglomerate capital 26,000; Seiryu Bank capital 22,815; Hayakawa Conglomerate capital 17,132; Dai-ichi Mutual Capital 15,000; Yurindo Life Capital 13,050; Mitsui Conglomerate Capital 52,889; Okura Conglomerate Capital 10,920. From this point of view, it is not difficult to see at a glance who is the driving force behind the Manchurian and Mongolian invasion policy. The purpose of these conglomerates in advocating the so-called "supra-party Manchurian and Mongolian management" is nothing more than to invade our Northeast with a unified national pace and maximize their aggressive capabilities.

<h3>Japan-Russia Fishery Zone Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Ruble Issue: Russia's Reply Delivered to Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Hirota Telegraphs About Negotiation Situation</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd - Regarding the ruble issue, Japanese Ambassador Hirota in Russia received government instructions on the 19th and visited Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Karakhan at 5:00 PM on the 20th, presenting the Japanese side's final proposal. Part of the Russian response arrived at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM this morning and is currently being translated. It should be completed today.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd - The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a long telegram from Ambassador Hirota today, reporting on his meeting with Karakhan. The Japanese proposal put forward by Ambassador Hirota included: (1) Fishery zone rent will be temporarily paid at the exchange rate of three corners, and the shortfall will be collected through diplomatic negotiations; (2) The ruble issue and the issue of increasing the number of state-owned fishery zones will be negotiated together, but for the issue of each fishery zone, it is intended to negotiate further after the on-the-spot issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - Japanese fishing companies are now becoming impatient because the negotiations have been delayed for a long time, they will miss the fishing season, and the fishing boats are idle, resulting in huge losses. The Japanese want to send fishing boats directly to the Russian fishing zone to operate, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has tried its best to dissuade them. If the fishing boats were to go, they would inevitably clash with the Soviet Russian fishery patrol boats and hinder the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Foreigners from Infringing Upon Fishing Rights</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting May 1st</p>
<p>Japan Requests Reconsideration</p>
<p>Shigemitsu Kui Returns to Nagasaki</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - It is reported that the Chinese government has notified the Japanese government that, starting May 1st, Japanese fishing boats under 100 tons will not be allowed to enter Chinese ports, and Japanese boats must not unload fish in China without a bill of lading. After receiving the document, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately asked the Chinese government to reconsider the matter, but the Chinese government has not yet shown any intention to change its decision. It is expected that Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to China Shigemitsu Kui will return to Tokyo on the 24th of this month and discuss this with the authorities. For the time being, the Japanese consul in China will try to negotiate a solution with the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Reuters, Nagasaki, 22nd - Shigemitsu Kui arrived here at noon today aboard the Shanghai Maru. According to his statement to the press, he returned to the country this time to discuss unresolved issues in Sino-Japanese negotiations with the new cabinet, such as extraterritoriality. Shigemitsu Kui is scheduled to go to Kobe tonight. The Shanghai Maru also carries 22 Chinese painters participating in the Tokyo Art Exhibition.</p>
<h3>Governor of the Bank of England Returns Home</h3>
<p>Agreed on a Plan to Organize a World Bank</p>
<p>The Content Is Not Yet Released</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - Governor Norman of the Bank of England has returned to England from the United States. It is expected that this trip may have an impact on world finance. Norman himself does not currently disclose the content of his meeting with American bankers, but it is believed that Norman must have discussed with the American financial community the plan to organize a World Trade Credit Bank in the United States, in order to help countries whose purchasing power has been greatly reduced due to the fall in prices. If such a bank organization plan can succeed, it will be extremely beneficial to promoting the restoration of world prosperity. When the shareholders of the Bank for International Settlements hold their annual meeting in Basel, Switzerland, Norman may announce the details of this plan. It is reported that if the World Trade Credit Bank is established, Russia can also enjoy the benefits of the bank.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Committee Telegram - To the Party Departments of all provinces and cities, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, and all newspaper offices: Since the Opium War, our country has been trapped by unequal treaties for more than 80 years. Imperialists have taken advantage of this to infringe upon our sovereignty, suck our blood, and massacre our compatriots. The pain and suffering of the people caused by the imperialists are deeply rooted and unbearable. The nation's hatred for the existence of unequal treaties is shared by the entire country and deepens with each passing day. In the past, during the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the Beiping puppet government, the national government was controlled by feudal remnants and evil warlords. The people had no opportunity to freely develop their aspirations. These traitors only knew their own selfish interests and did not hesitate to sacrifice the country's lifeline, colluding with or begging from imperialists in order to prolong their survival. The imperialists also took advantage of them, providing them with tools for aggression, which led to a worsening international position, a completely destroyed national sovereignty, endless internal strife, and a declining people's livelihood. The reason for this is that unequal treaties are the root of all evil. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of our Party, deeply knew that if we want freedom and equality for our country, we will not succeed without abolishing unequal treaties. In the declaration of the First National Congress, he had already revealed his foreign policy, and on his deathbed, he still earnestly told the people to convene a national assembly to abolish unequal treaties. Our Party has inherited the Premier's legacy, eliminated the warlords, and completed the great cause of unification. Today, under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People of our Party, the people of the whole country know that abolishing unequal treaties is the only way for our Chinese nation to seek liberation and survival. At this time when the entire country is beginning to unify and build, such harsh treaties that hinder national independence and ethnic survival cannot be allowed to exist for even one more day. However, all imperialists, because they are unfavorable to our country's independence and self-strengthening, have always used cunning words to delay and refuse to give up the abolition of unequal treaties. Fortunately, the National Assembly is about to open, and the major task of the Assembly is to seek national construction internally and to abolish unequal treaties externally. If the countries concerned cannot respect the will of our people and voluntarily give up all privileges, then our people, for the sake of national freedom and equality, and for the sake of ethnic survival, will have no choice but to automatically declare the abolition of all unequal treaties at the National Assembly, and must even move towards economic severance and persevere in seeking the final victory. The people of the whole country should swear to be the government's support, implement the goal of national revolutionary diplomacy, and not stop until all unequal treaties have been abolished. Our Committee previously resolved at the 92nd meeting on April 1, "It is recommended that the Central Government submit all unequal treaties to the National Assembly for separate cancellation." We, the comrades of all provinces and cities, and the compatriots of the whole country, please rise up and advocate together to seek implementation. The future of the Party and the country depends on it. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee of the Kuomintang bows in respect.</p>

<h3>Shandong Provincial Committee Inspects Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu recently went to southern Shandong to supervise troops in suppressing bandits and to inspect official governance. In view of the fact that Linyi, Mengyin, Sishui, Tengxian, Yixian, Tancheng, Yishui and other counties have been too ravaged by bandits, and the people's livelihood is difficult, if the urgent fundraising is not good, it will not be possible to settle the refugees, and Qingfeiyuan only uses military force to suppress the bandits, which is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, after the provincial government memorial week on the morning of the 20th, he immediately convened the High Court President Wu Zhenxuan and the entire provincial committee to hold an informal meeting at the provincial government to discuss this matter. After discussion, it was decided to promote Li Shuchun, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and He Siyuan, director of the Department of Education, to go to the bandit areas to inspect the local damage situation, so as to stipulate post-disaster arrangements. The two departments of agriculture, mining and finance also sent personnel to follow. It was scheduled to take the Beiping armored car from Jinan the next morning at 9:00 am. At 9:30 am today (21st), He and Li arrived at the station to get on the train. Those who saw them off included Wu Zhenxuan, President of the High Court, and Wen Chenglie, Mayor of Jinan. According to Li's report, he said that he would first go to Tengxian, then to Zaozhuang, change to a car to Linyi, and then stipulate the route, and go to Tancheng, Yixian, Feixian, Yishui and other counties for inspection. Finally, he will return to Jinan via Juxian, Zhucheng and Gaomi, which will take about a week. Afterwards, he will go to western Shandong for inspection. At ten o'clock, the Provincial Party Department sent Song Congyi to go with him to inspect Party affairs. (21st)</p>
<h3>Shandong Construction Department Diverts the Yellow River to Aid the Xiaoqing River Plan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The water volume of the Xiaoqing River from Zhangjialin, Zhangqiu, is extremely small every year in May and June. Not only can steamships not pass, but also ordinary civilian ships are very difficult to travel to and from. This is because at that time, it is the time when farmland needs water, and people along the coast draw water from the river to irrigate. However, this kind of water use has become a common practice, and it seems inappropriate to prohibit it suddenly. The Construction Department previously sent engineer Li Xiangzhen to investigate a drain from Wangjiali Village, Licheng County, to Zhangjialin, which was formed by the Yellow River breach in the 24th year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty. It is 29 kilometers long and 300 to 600 meters wide, covering an area of about 200 hectares. The land inside the drain is saline-alkali, and the lighter ones only produce reeds, and even grass does not grow. There is a pool of water at the northern end of the drain, close to the Yellow River levee, with an area of 50,000 square meters and an average depth of 5 meters. According to the measurement results, the water surface of the pool is 2.6 meters lower than the low water level of the Yellow River and 6 meters higher than the low water level of the Xiaoqing River. Therefore, the pool water can be introduced into the Xiaoqing River by slightly opening the drain. However, the water volume is limited and insufficient for navigation. A water diversion project should be implemented on the right bank of the Yellow River in Wangjiali Village to first divert the Yellow River water into the drain. After sedimentation, it is introduced into the Xiaoqing River for replenishment. With this increase in flow, the original water depth of 1.3 meters of the Xiaoqing River can be increased to 1.4 meters. In this way, year-round navigation can be guaranteed, and it is much more labor-saving than dredging the entire river. It is reported that the project has been carefully planned by the Construction Department and is planned to be submitted to the Provincial Government Affairs Conference for deliberation and implementation.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Headquarters Executes Important Red Bandits by Firing Squad</h3>

<h3>Treasures and Historical Sites of Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>Northern Frontier Correspondence: Kulun is located south of Dahanshan, controlling the Tula River. The pine and cypress trees on the mountain rise into the sky, connecting the blue sky. Strange flowers and rocks embellish the secluded valleys. Famous temples are scattered everywhere. Among them, there is a very magnificent building, which is the palace of the Living Buddha. The architectural style is based on Chinese rules, with painted walls and carved beams, and golden brilliance. It is said that the bricks and tiles are all wrapped in red gold, so they are durable and dazzling. According to those who talk about allusions, this palace was built in the 48th year of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty. Going south from the palace, crossing a drawbridge, which can be raised and lowered freely. To the south of the bridge, there are two palaces on the east and west. The east is called the Red Palace, and its bricks and tiles are all red, looking like roses in the wind. The west is called the White Palace, and its bricks and tiles are all white, like white fruit emerging from the water after spring rain. This partial palace of the Living Buddha has a wealth of scriptures. At that time, the architecture was just the Living Buddha's inspiration, constructed at will, and only took its wealth and splendor. Unexpectedly, three hundred years later, it was successively occupied by the Red and White Parties. It seems that things were already foreshadowed. Now the White Party has fled, and the Red Party is resting in it. Lamaist believers look at it with sideways glances and dare not say anything. To the south of Kulun and north of Nalin, there is a mountain stretching for dozens of miles. In the middle of the strange peaks, there has been a large crack since the world began, about three feet wide, wider and wider as it goes down, and the length is unknown for thousands of feet. The wind blows down from the sky, and it is difficult for people to stand. When the Qing Emperor Kangxi drove to conquer the northern vassals, he abandoned the heavy silver he carried in this large stone crack in order to prepare for border emergencies and withdraw it again, so as to avoid round-trip transportation. Later, the Mongols were greedy and tied people down to take it. When the one tied above held the treasure out, he was already frozen stiff for a long time. Therefore, they did not dare to try it lightly. They also peeled a whole sheep, without removing the grease, and sent it down. Sure enough, several treasures were stuck out, relying on the power of freezing to go up. Unexpectedly, when approaching the crack, the freezing force was warmed by the warm air and lost its effectiveness, and it still fell back to its original place. Recently, the Russian explorer Nilov discovered it and planned to use scientific methods to take out the entire amount to use as the basic gold for promoting redization. He is currently applying to the Outer Mongolian government for assistance in order to achieve success as soon as possible. This hundreds of years of legacy gold and silver will soon be acquired by blue-eyed people, but tracing its origin, isn't it the fat of our Han people? Because the land does not belong to us, the treasure also changes its surname.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Election Results of Farmer Education Group Representatives Announced: National Assembly representatives, farmer education groups, and voting elections were held at the county party headquarters on the 20th.

<p>Shen Surname Murder Case: Higher Court Orders Autopsy Re-examination: The sensational murder case outside the West Gate of this county, which shocked Su and Chang, has been inspected twice by the county government. Both inspections concluded that the deceased, Shen Fugeng, only had minor injuries that were not fatal. However, the deceased's family insisted that he was beaten to death by Wang Erguan. Therefore, the county government specifically requested the Higher Court to order an autopsy re-examination. It is now learned that the Higher Court has sent an order to the county, stating that to avoid the trouble of travel, no one would be sent to Changshu. Instead, a doctor should be appointed within the original county to perform the autopsy and report the verified findings. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Tan summoned official doctors Shao Yufan, Xie Tang, and Huang Chengxi to the county government for discussion. All three doctors believed that the case had already been examined twice and determined to be minor injuries (Note: Xie and Huang were also involved in the first two inspections). Therefore, an autopsy would not make much difference. Moreover, whether the deceased's family was willing to undergo an autopsy was another issue. Even if it were approved, and the result still showed minor injuries, who would be responsible? Furthermore, the body had been buried for a long time and was already decomposed, making it even more difficult to detect injuries. Due to these various issues, the discussion ended without a result. It is now learned that the county government has scheduled to summon the Shen family and submit the opinions of the two official doctors to the Higher Court for review on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Gunfight Between Soldiers and Bandits on Train: Train No. 6, heading from Beijing to Wuxi, was passing Qixia Mountain near Zhenjiang at around 5:00 PM yesterday when Zhang Hong, a railway police inspector on board, was checking passengers in the third-class carriage. He noticed a suspicious-looking individual and proceeded to inspect him. He found a pistol on the person. Realizing that he had been exposed, the bandit violently attacked Zhang Hong, attempting to seize the pistol. At that moment, military police on board arrived and immediately apprehended him. Just as they were about to take him away for legal processing, nine other bandits emerged from the carriage to resist. A gunfight ensued inside the carriage, lasting about ten minutes. As a result, one bandit was killed, and Chen Shikui, Zhang Er, and Lou Kailuan were captured. Two Browning pistols were seized. The rest escaped by jumping out of the windows. The captured bandits were immediately escorted to Wuxi and handed over to the regimental headquarters for strict legal processing.</p>
<p>Water Chestnut Boat Robbed in Wuxi: Dai Youzhi, a native of Xinghua, has been selling water chestnuts in Qishuyan Town, which belongs to Changzhou County. Recently, Dai's goods were about to be sold out, and he planned to go to Hangzhou to purchase more. So, the day before yesterday, he took 300 yuan in capital and hired a boat, accompanied by a boatman, and set sail from the town. When passing through Lao Liku near Shitangwan in this county, it was late, so they stopped the boat and stayed overnight. Around midnight, a hooded boat suddenly approached, and four bandits jumped onto Dai's boat. They tied up Dai Youzhi and the boatman with ropes and stuffed cotton into their mouths. Then, they turned the rudder and searched the boat at will. After about an hour, they took the stolen goods, jumped back onto their original boat, and sped away. Dai and the boatman, seeing that the bandits were far away, checked their losses and found that the 300 yuan in capital they had brought was all stolen.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Busts Opium Den: Xu Jigui, the director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, received a tip-off yesterday morning (the 22nd) that a resident named Yang was privately selling opium and opium-smoking paraphernalia at his home in Xihetou in the city. He was making a lot of money and had never been caught in decades. Director Xu immediately secretly ordered Inspector Lei Jiaqu to dispatch several inspectors and police officers to search the premises. They caught the opium den owner, He Da (who was Yang's chauffeur), and eight opium smokers: Yang Jihua, Chen Liuxian, Qian Rongpei, Yang Dabao, Cao Zhongying, Hua Ruifu, and Yang Zhao. They also found a large number of opium lamps, pipes, and other evidence. They were all taken to the bureau. After Zhang, the section chief, held a trial, he prepared a document and presented it to the county court at 4:00 PM for a hearing and judgment.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Meeting on Business Tax: The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting of representatives from various industries yesterday to discuss how to comply with the provincial order to levy business tax starting on April 1st. More than 50 people from 35 industries attended. Qian Sunqing chaired the meeting. The meeting's proceedings were as follows: (1) The chairman reported on the meetings held in the town on April 3rd and 15th, as well as the petition process in the provincial and central governments. He stated that the provincial order had set April 1st as the starting date for levying the tax, and each industry should prepare in advance to avoid temporary disputes. The industry representatives believed that the business tax law had just been proposed and drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and the chambers of commerce in various counties were also requesting a reduction in the tax rate. If the tax were levied suddenly, the merchants and civilians would not know what to do. It was resolved that each industry association would submit a petition to the provincial government, requesting a postponement of the tax collection until the business tax law had been established by the Legislative Yuan. (2) The chairman reported on the meeting with the director of the business tax bureau and advocated for each industry to contract for tax payment to avoid various disputes. It was resolved that each industry association would hold separate meetings to discuss the plan and then reconvene to discuss the matter further. (3) Representatives of the soy sauce and wine industry stated that taxes such as public sales licenses had already been paid for alcohol, so how should this be deducted? It was resolved that alcohol should be removed, and only the income from the soy sauce and oil business should be reported. (4) Representatives of the timber industry said that the timber business was buying and selling on behalf of customers and had paid tooth tax (brokerage tax), so they should not have to pay business tax. It was resolved that the Chamber would send a telegram to the provincial government to clarify.</p>
<p>Case of the "Dexin" Steamboat Robbery Solved: On January 17th of last year, at around 8:00 AM, the "Dexin" small steamboat of the Yangxian Steamboat Company's Wuxi-Shu route was sailing from Wuxi to Shu. When passing through the Tanghe River near Gaoqiao in the 16th district, more than ten bandits suddenly fired at the steamboat from the shore. Three bandits, disguised as passengers, had already purchased tickets and boarded the boat. At this time, they also fired guns and forced the boat to stop. The passengers were robbed, and no one was spared, with losses amounting to over 3,000 yuan. After the incident, the company reported it to the county government for strict investigation. A secret informant recently tipped off County Magistrate Pan that the bandits, including Shi Jinyuan, were hiding in Shanghai. He immediately dispatched Wang Jinbiao, a special agent from the Water Patrol Team, to Shanghai with a warrant to investigate. Wang discovered that Shi Jinyuan was hiding in a thatched shed in Xiaoshadu Yaoshui Lane. He then worked with the chief of the 6th district police station to arrest Shi at his address and hand him over to the police station. After interrogation, Shi confessed that he was a 32-year-old man from Baoying. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday, Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the Wuxi Water Patrol Team, went to Shanghai to escort Shi back to Wuxi for interrogation and legal processing.</p>

Last year, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway held a business meeting, and the Chamber of Commerce, based on the request of the Silk Cocoon Industry Association, proposed reducing the freight rate for dry cocoons. This was approved and submitted to the Ministry of Railways for review.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Uncle Blackmailed by Nephew and Accomplices: Sun Yuling, from Anhui, stayed at the Fu'an Inn in Sanshan Lane with his nephew and his wife, Sun Ruiting and Li Sunshi. Chang Yaowu, who impersonated a lawyer, also lived there. He started by nodding to Sun Yuling, then became his confidant and frequent visitor. The night before, Sun Yuling, feeling lonely while traveling alone, was introduced to a prostitute by a room attendant for company. His nephew and his wife saw this and discussed with Chang how to blackmail Sun. Chang then went to the area near the China Merchants Bureau by the river and colluded with Wang Jinbiao and two others to inspect the Fu'an Inn. They immediately apprehended Sun, claiming he was illegally engaging in illicit sex in a private room and violating the law. They pretended to take him away. Chang then pretended to mediate, saying that 50 yuan could resolve the matter privately. Sun admitted to 25 yuan and gave it to Chang Yaowu. Sun returned to his hometown the next morning. Wang Jinbiao and Sun Ruiting went to the inn to divide the loot with Chang, but Chang refused to give them anything. Wang and the others were furious and got into a fight, which led to them being taken to the 2nd Sub-station of the 5th Precinct to argue. The patrol officer at the station, seeing that they dared to impersonate public officials and extort money, which was extremely illegal, prepared a document and sent them to the bureau for processing.</p>

<h3>Reaffirming the Significance of the Child-Centered Approach</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zonghai</p>
<p>The shift from a curriculum-centered approach to a child-centered approach in education represents a significant revolution, embodying the core of educational thought since Rousseau.</p>
<p>Rousseau was the first to raise the banner of revolution. He urged us to value children, stating, "You believe you know the value of time and fear wasting it, but you have not considered that if it is used improperly, it is better to let it pass. A child who is not taught properly is further away from goodness and beauty than someone who has not learned anything. You fear seeing him waste his childhood years, but is it really a waste to be happy and energetic, running and jumping all day? He will never be this happy again in his life. If someone refuses to sleep, believing that they would waste a part of their life otherwise, what would you think of this person?"</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, Pestalozzi, Froebel, and others further promoted this idea. Researchers in child psychology have also provided us with a wealth of materials, enabling us to better understand the phenomena of children at various stages. The improvements in the content of elementary education in the past century can be attributed to this concept. Therefore, Adams said that the greatest contribution of modern educational theory is the discovery of the child, and using the child as the center of education.</p>
<p>This concept influences our view of education, especially educational methods. With the curriculum as the center, education is an external imposition, prone to standardization. With the child as the center, education is development, with less emphasis on conservatism and more on progress. All concepts such as "autonomy," "interest," and "individual adaptation" stem from this.</p>
<p>However, a person cannot exist independently from the environment. Our adaptation cannot always be purely self-centered. Moreover, to adapt appropriately, we must adopt or refer to the established methods of the current society. Therefore, the curriculum must be considered. The so-called "child-centered" approach does not ignore the curriculum, and completely separating from the curriculum would cause the meaning of development to lose its basis. Therefore, the child-centered approach is merely a matter of emphasis (see my translation of Dewey's original work, "The Child and the Curriculum," published by the Zhonghua Book Company). Furthermore, "child-centered" does not mean permissiveness, let alone indulgence. Educators should have a broad vision. However, adults, especially parents, must be careful not to "force growth" and must prevent "haste makes waste." On the one hand, they should base their actions on the needs and inherent energy of childhood, enrich their lives to develop their talents. Raggs said that "child-centered schools" should focus on two things: understanding the environment and expressing oneself. Dewey said, "Development lies in enabling children to have a deep understanding of a few representative situations, so as to gradually know how to deal with the problems of experience, rather than in the accumulation of knowledge." In this way, the gradual extension of attention, the accuracy of observation, and the methodical practice of memory and thought, especially the maintenance and development of the interest in seeking knowledge, are very important. Last year, Dewey said in the New Republic magazine that if new education does not emphasize the development of the intellectual aspects, then new education will be a failure.</p>
<p>Therefore, child-centered education not only wants children to be happy in their lives but also seeks to achieve the effects of children's lives. Of course, the happiness of children's lives cannot be ignored. Thorndike said, "In fact, if we get rid of adult tendencies, but seek adult benefits and convenience, and think about giving children innocent and carefree happiness, how cost-effective it is. Considering that children's likes and dislikes are often (but not always) a guide to their future happiness, and are no less reliable than our arbitrary decisions, then we should not regard current happiness as a trivial matter in school education." He meant that Dewey's education is an element of life, and wants "people to live happily and beneficially at every moment from birth to death." This "is not a doting attitude towards children, but purely a calm observation, knowing that this is the best way to achieve various highest and distant goals in life."</p>
<p>Article 13 of the internal policies of the platform of the Chinese Kuomintang states, "To fully develop child-centered education." Those engaged in elementary education must have a deep understanding of this and promote this meaning to families as well.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Doubts Regarding the Publication Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has approved the Internal Affairs Ministry's response and explanation on various points of doubt regarding the Publication Law. It has instructed the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, stating that, upon investigation, the department previously requested clarification on various points of doubt regarding the Publication Law. The Ministry relayed these requests to the Internal Affairs Ministry for interpretation and instructed the department to take note accordingly. Now, with the approval of the Internal Affairs Ministry's response, "the provincial government" as referred to in the Publication Law naturally refers to the provincial government as the competent executive authority. Publications distributed in counties and cities should also be submitted through the provincial government to which the city belongs to the Internal Affairs Ministry or directly to the Internal Affairs Ministry for handling in accordance with Articles 7 and 13 of the Publication Law. Counties and cities (cities not directly under the Executive Yuan) are not allowed to conduct registration of publications or review of books. However, if the county or city government discovers that publications distributed within its jurisdiction violate the restrictions of Articles 19 to 21 of the Publication Law, it may submit a request to the provincial government for legal action. The response is to be noted and the two counties, Yuyao and Jiaxing, are to be informed.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province to</h3>
<p>Discontinue Special Education Institutions Starting Next Semester</p>
<p>Various departments in Zhejiang Province run special education institutions to train specialized personnel for their needs. For example, the Finance Department runs a financial personnel training institute, the Construction Department runs construction personnel and weights and measures personnel training institutes, and the Civil Affairs Department runs an autonomous specialized school, police academy, police training institute, surveying personnel training institute, etc. The total annual expenditure is no less than over 400,000 yuan. Wang Chengying of the Finance Department, in view of the difficulty in matching the budget for the 20th year of the Republic, in addition to making substantial reductions in the new budget, believes that the current special talent in Zhejiang Province seems to be sufficient for application. After the existing students graduate, the recruitment of new students will be discontinued to bring these to a close.</p>

The purpose of this trip is not only to engage in friendly matches with basketball athletes from that country to improve skills, but also to study the current status of women's sports in Japan, so that they can learn from it after returning home. The entire team of thirteen people is led by the school's Principal Lu Lihua. As this concerns national prestige, it is hoped that the countrymen will provide assistance at any time.</p>

<h3>A Word of Insight</h3>
<p>— An Old Contributor</p>
<p>Love and money are the fuel of life. If the supply of fuel is cut off, the flame of life will be extinguished immediately.</p>
<p>Before marriage, the taste of love is intoxicating like mellow wine. After marriage, the taste of love is astringent and bitter like black tea.</p>
<p>The Young Master of the Garden said, "Girls are made of water, and men are made of mud." Therefore, when a man meets a woman, it is like a mud cow falling into water.</p>
<p>Unmarried women are truly like sacred and inviolable beings. Married women are just like that, nothing more. So-called great men are also like that.</p>
<p>The way to make friends is to be simple and tasteful. The same is true of love. The simpler, the more lasting and flavorful.</p>
<p>Only love for one's children can reduce love for one's husband. Therefore, there are more loving mothers than virtuous wives in the world.</p>
<p>Jealousy is the sublimation of a woman's love.</p>
<p>Love between the sexes is like the connection of opposite electrical currents. The power of the battery should be increased from time to time in order to maintain the spark of love.</p>
<p>A modern poem says, "A poor life with a simple hairpin is better than a flower." I hope that those in the world who have yellow-faced wives will be proud of this poem.</p>
<h3>A Record of Xu Yousun, a Boatman on the West Lake</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shoukuang</p>
<p>"Firmly plant your feet, the mountains behind you will not fly away; hold the handprint, the Buddha's face before you is as it is." This is a wonderful couplet in the newly built monastery of Yunlin Temple in West Lake. After my trip to Lingyin Temple, I walked to Yue Tomb and took a yacht back. The old boatman Xu Yousun said that he was fifty-eight years old, registered in Chongde, and had forty acres of land. Farming and eating was not a problem, and his two daughters were already married. One son could inherit his business, and he already had a grandson. Yousun comes to Hangzhou every year in February to work as a boatman, and then returns to his hometown in late August. He spends his years leisurely. The income from boating in Hangzhou, after deducting half a yuan for daily food and drink, still has a surplus, which is enough for his usual use. Therefore, he is carefree on the lake, very happy. I said, "You already have a small fortune, and you don't worry about food and clothing. When you are almost sixty years old, you still work at this. Isn't it hard?" Yousun smiled and said, "Sir, do you think I am working hard? I am enjoying it. The scenery of West Lake is the best in the world. From the south of Baiyue to the north of Yanji, wealthy merchants and officials spend huge sums of money every year to visit this land, but they only stay temporarily. But I don't spend a penny, and I am in the lake scenery day and night. With a light stroke of the oar, I can roam freely and contentedly. I work during the day and rest at night, and I am self-reliant. I don't ask for help and I don't worry about food. I am actually doing a job for leisure, not making a living for food. I have three things I don't do in this business: one is strong wind, two is rain and snow, and three is dawn on the first day of the lunar month, even if I am paid a heavy price. Because wind and rain are dangerous and hard work, I will definitely go to Tianzhu Temple to visit the Goddess of Mercy on the first day of the lunar month, no matter whether it is sunny or rainy. Mr. Ma Yinchu once sat in my boat and talked very happily. I don't know what economics is, but I know how to live within my means, not accumulating wealth and not wasting it. The world is just a temporary inn, and people must know how to be content. God has given me an old but not frail body, so I can enjoy what I enjoy. What more can I ask for? Last year, I had a surplus of funds, so I spent a hundred yuan to take care of my funeral affairs. Once I die, I will have a place to go. From then on, I will be free and unfettered, and the years of my life will be nothing but happy days." At this point, the boat had reached the shore. Yousun received the money and thanked me, and with a light stroke of the oar, he plunged back into the depths of the misty waves. I returned to my residence and remembered the couplet in the monastery and what the boatman said, and I couldn't help but feel lost for several days.</p>
<h3>A Record of Sorting Out the Posthumous Manuscripts of Juemi</h3>
<p>— Wu Kezhen</p>
<p>In the recent three or five years, my late brother Juemi devoted himself to reading books because he had been serving our late mother with illness and living in the countryside for a long time. In addition to serving medicine, he devoted himself to reading books. The reason for this is that my late grandfather and great-grandfather did not manage fields, and the income from official travel and the inkstone field was used to purchase books. Therefore, he continued his ancestors' aspirations. The books in the family are stored, although they are not enough to be called ten thousand volumes, but they have already occupied five rooms. Juemi sat in the book city every day, and he was happy and carefree, without worrying about loneliness. The daily progress of his writing and the increase in his writing were all due to the small study. The publications published in lead printing are countless, and he feels that he has gained research experience in textual research. Although my family has very few fine engraved isolated copies, the local chronicles of various provinces are indeed numerous. Now I have examined his posthumous manuscripts, and it seems that there are more than twenty kinds that are slightly valuable for writing. Due to my weak ability, none of them have been published. I will briefly describe one or two to inform you. Those about history include: A History of Shanghai Diplomacy, An Interpretation of the Yangjingbang Regulations, A History of the Evolution of Concessions in Various Places, A Study of the Origin of Dredging the Wusong River, and Miscellaneous Records of Border Defense in the Qing Dynasty, a total of six kinds. A manuscript of A History of Shanghai Diplomacy has now been handed over to Mr. Ye Mujiao of the Diplomatic Department for preservation. Those about textual research include: Corrections to the Chronology of Past Dynasties, Textual Research on Ancient Sites in the Yangtze River Basin, Detailed Textual Research on the Holy Sites of Qufu, and Jianghu Bai Opera. This book details the origins and responses of the Three Religions and Nine Schools since the Qin and Han Dynasties, and is linked to the biographies of various famous people. There are also Shanghai Ancient Tomb Archaeological Records, Small Records of the Sex of Various Collectors, and Miscellaneous Records of Ancient Inkstone Inscriptions, a total of seven kinds. Those about miscellaneous compilations include: Du's Poetry Notes on the Left Bank of the Huangpu River, two volumes. This book is the posthumous work of Du Yuesheng, a famous person in Shanghai. However, they are all scattered in various poetry collections or manuscripts. It took many years of effort to compile them. It has now been handed over to Mr. Yuesheng for preservation. There are also six volumes of selected notes and several kinds of expository book notes. The so-called expository book notes are diaries of the daily sorting of books stored at home, which are used as the basis for compiling a bibliography after completion. There are many other fragments. I plan to make some slight adjustments and choose the best ones for publication. Li Youzhi, the brother-in-law of a Shanghai Chinese scholar, has agreed to take on the task of compiling them, and will combine the remaining short articles and fragments and title them Juemi Series for publication. It is a pity to let Juemi's life's work be lost. As for the unorganized books in the family, I plan to process them systematically during the summer vacation. My friend Chen Zibao, former librarian of the Jiande Savings Association, has considerable experience in the preparation of bibliographies. Now he has agreed to my request to help me organize them and complete the expository book notes. Although I am unworthy, I will of course do my best to preserve the ancient books in the family. Otherwise, the legacy of my ancestors will be completely lost. If Juemi knows, he will have no regrets in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>After Watching the Screening of "Human-Animal Spectacle"</h3>
<p>— Yu Kaixu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was invited by the deacons of the Carlton to attend the preview of "Human-Animal Spectacle" at the Grand Light Cinema. At first, I didn't know the content of the film, and I thought it was just a work of similar material to the previous hunting photography films. I have always regarded the previous films as ordinary. Later, I heard from someone who had read the book that there were quite a few disturbing things in the film. This film was made entirely based on the actual situation in Africa, and cannot be compared with those created by imagination. When the screen opened, I realized that the film was made jointly by the various colonial governments, great explorers, and great hunters in Africa. Otherwise, it would not have been possible to make this film so great and would have been reduced to child's play in an ordinary circus. Furthermore, the sacrifice made in this film was huge. In addition to the deaths and injuries of wild animals such as lions, rhinos, tigers, and leopards, the sacrifice of human life was the greatest. There were piles of human heads and half-rotten human corpses. It was not just for the filming of this film that cruel and inhumane actions were deliberately taken. They were all adventurously photographed from the cannibal countries of Africa. Other things, such as the hunting of lions and leopards, the fighting of groups of lions, etc., were also not fictitious. Watching it, in addition to shaking my bones and being unbearable, I could indeed know the real situation in the barren forests of Africa. As for the greatest sacrifice, it was that a black man was killed by a rhinoceros. The rhinoceros is the most ferocious of the beasts, and anyone who comes into contact with it will die immediately. Another huge lion was stabbed in the brain by a black man with a sharp stick that was about a foot long. The lion roared like thunder, jumped wildly three or four times, and then fell to the ground and died. In other cases, the cannibal countries of Africa hunt human heads in all directions, beating drums and shouting loudly. Just hearing the sound can make you tremble with fear. Furthermore, in the cannibal country, there is a female chief who is extremely beautiful. Her ancestors were probably white people who fell into the cannibal country. Later, she was rescued by white people. This is an insertion that the author cannot but make. Otherwise, this film will lose its spiritual regulation. As for me, as the reporter, I had a beautiful and unparalleled, graceful and natural, yellow-haired, slender-bodied wild woman in front of me, which made me unforgettable for a long time. After watching this film, I still feel that everything is vivid in my mind.</p>
<h3>An Eulogy</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>At the beginning of every obituary, there must be an image. The image must have an eulogy. The eulogy must be brilliant and written by great figures of the time. In fact, it is still a few poor scholars who touch their beards and hold their pens, doing a poor job. The so-called bitter interest of the Tathagata, I have also tasted a share of this bitter interest. After a long time, I realized the mistakes I made. The mistake was that the text did not match the topic. If you examine the works, they are all biographies and eulogies, not image eulogies. Since it is named image eulogy, it is only suitable to praise the image. Therefore, a great revolution began in the image eulogy world, and the image eulogy of a new era is as follows:</p>
<p>Praise the head of the deceased, shaped like a bamboo basket, drilled like a awl tip. Praise the eyes of the deceased, like a sling, with a small capacity but shallow eyelids, and an improper chest but dull pupils. Praise the nose of the deceased, with two holes facing the sky, not knowing fragrance or stench, like pomace wine. Praise the mouth of the deceased, like a crosstalk actor shouting, able to open a basin of blood, but unable to wag a three-inch tongue. Cupping the beak, the pig is Bajie, and closing the mouth, the bird is Li Kui. Praise the ears of the deceased, not knowing a single secret, big and upright like the Rabbit God, small and twitched like a mouse. Are these distinctive five senses not worthy of careful examination? Originally, the image in ancient times was only made of stone. Now it is flexible, and the image is taken by a mirror. It can be enlarged or reduced. There are several life photos, and this set must come for the death obituary. It is enough to commemorate and to fulfill filial piety. Why do you write texts that do not match the topic and wear hats that do not fit the head? There are many tasteless compliments, which come with the ridicule of those who know. If the dead have knowledge, they will be frightened when they see it. Therefore, Xun Qing wrote "Discourses on the Appearance", and Tantai lost his appearance. Seven mouths and eight tongues, ten hemp and nine beauties. Dimples are charming and forehead is born, eyelashes are soft and cheeks are surrounded. When the monk gets angry, his appearance is ugly. When the emperor is chopped, his neck is good. The red-headed aesthetic A-San, the powdered double-material Cao Cao. What is there to be a land of spirits and heroes? It is simply born unfilial. Moreover, the head is like a deer, the eyes are like a mouse, the nose is like a hawk, and the eyes are like a falcon. The skin is beautiful and the bones are ugly, and the fat intestines are full of brains. The muscles do not bind the bones, which is called ghostly agitation. Intrinsic cowardice and stern expression, stealing through holes. The ears eat the memory and have light, the face is not needed but is often swept. There must be plague and insatiable greed. Making feces is a complete machine, and a mess is an inverted treasure. Four feet face the sky, and the braid must be raised. When a breath does not come, three people look at each other and laugh. Alas, how can it not be early?</p>
<p>Brief News: Ms. Ziluolan, a famous Cantonese singer and dancer, has returned to Shanghai to perform again, winning the praise of the audience. Ms. has also made a trip to Jin-Ping. Yesterday, I received a letter from my friend Li Ziyuanxing, who came from Ping, saying that the Nancheng Amusement Park in Beiping specially hired Ms. to perform on stage. Like a fairy scattering flowers, Bao Lian Deng, Wu Jia Po, Lou Dong Yuan, Half-sided Chicken, Babu Lao teaching his daughter, Picking Flower Girl, Xiao Qing Hanging Shadow, Chan Fang Night Resentment, Huo Xiaoyu, Suzhou Small Songs, Toe Dance, Ziluolan Dance, etc., all are wonderful and unparalleled. Therefore, the press has praised her greatly. (Rui Hongchu)</p>
<h3>A True Account of the Execution of Taibao Ashu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhutian</p>
<p>Ten Yuan for Outfit: This time, Wang Fusheng, the executioner hired in Shanghai, and his three assistants used to specialize in this profession during the Sun Chuanfang era. In recent years, with the abolition of beheading, Wang and others had fallen on hard times in Shanghai, struggling to make a living. They were overjoyed to be summoned this time, but because their clothes were tattered, they requested money for an outfit. Each was given ten yuan to buy a set of black lined clothes and trousers, get a haircut and bath, and appear brand new. In total, each person earned an average of twenty to thirty yuan this time, which was enough to cover their living expenses for more than a month.</p>
<p>Sent to His Children: From the time Taibao Ashu was escorted away until his execution, the one thing he couldn't stop thinking about was his two surviving sons. According to custom, the clothes worn by a condemned prisoner at the time of execution belonged to the executioner. However, at the time of the binding, Taibao Ashu's blue crepe cotton robe and a set of blue silk gauze lined jacket and trousers were still worth a considerable sum. Therefore, he instructed the soldiers to pawn the clothes and send the proceeds to his two sons as temporary relief. Those who heard this agreed. However, the address of the two sons was unknown, so there was no way to send it to them. Naturally, it still ended up in the executioner's pocket. If the dead have knowledge, they must be deeply grieved.</p>
<p>Claiming to Follow Orders: After Taibao Ashu and his brother arrived at the execution ground, the executioner Wang Fusheng and his assistants were already there. The knife they held was of the type used by the Big Sword Squad, with a newly sharpened blade that gleamed. Taibao Ashu and his brother knelt back-to-back. Taibao was executed first, followed by his brother. The whole process took less than three minutes. During the execution, one person held Taibao's hands behind his back and said, "Following orders, this has nothing to do with me." Another person held a rope around Taibao's neck, pulling it forward, also saying, "Following orders." Finally, the executioner approached and patted Taibao's abdomen, saying, "Following orders to kill you, please don't blame me." Then he lightly pressed on Taibao's neck, holding the knife behind his back in his right hand. At this point, the person holding Taibao's hands shouted loudly, and in an instant, the executioner raised his knife and brought it down, slashing several times. The head fell to the ground. At that time, although Taibao's brother witnessed his brother's death, his expression remained unchanged. It can be said to be the most tragic event imaginable.</p>
<p>Blood Money for Exorcism: According to custom, the shackles should be broken after the execution. The shackles of Taibao Ashu and his brother weighed about seven pounds. After the heads were severed, the executioner used the knife handle to break the shackles. However, Taibao's brother, Xu Fusheng, injured his foot accidentally during the breaking. Bloodstains were evident on the outside of his sock. After the execution, spectators each took out copper coins, suspended a short rope through the coin hole, and dipped the rope into the blood from the severed neck, saying it could suppress evil. They carefully wrapped it in white paper and put it in their pockets. Some women who had come from afar to watch even bought these evil-suppressing coins at the price of several yuan. Their foolishness was beyond compare.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of India (32)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Indians have large bodies. The travel beds they sell are about eight inches longer than those in China, which proves it. Their hair is black, which is different from Europeans, but their deep-set eyes and high noses are different from Easterners, but similar to Europeans. However, their noses are not as sharp as those of Caucasians, which is proof that they are both Aryans. According to Indians, they originally came from the upper reaches of the Ganges River in the Pamir region and were originally called Brahmins. As for the indigenous people of India, they already existed. They are the most primitive people with the lowest level of culture. Some small groups are still preserved in the mountains and forests, it is said. This is probably the same as the Miao people in China and the Ezo people in Japan.</p>
<p>Most Indian men have their hair cut, but the most interesting thing in the lower classes is that they only leave a small portion on the top of their heads, a few dozen strands, like a child's braid in our country. Some women also cut their hair. The custom of piercing the nose remains, which is the most unaesthetic.</p>
<p>There is a kind of expression in Indian gestures that we easily misunderstand, which is their habit of shaking their heads. If we think that agreeing is nodding, and disagreeing is shaking, Indians are the opposite. Their shaking their heads indicates approval. I often misunderstood or could not understand. It was only after a long time that I gradually understood. But I'm still not used to it.</p>
<p>On the 17th, I happened to pass by a place and was very hungry and thirsty. I saw a snack shop and went in to eat. I sat and drank cold water. They gave me a clay cup to drink from. The snacks were delicious. After eating, they told me to take the rest of the snack with me, otherwise I had to throw it in the street. They also told me to throw the clay cup on the street and break it. I didn't understand very well and asked firmly. They confirmed that I should throw it, break it, and throw it away. I was very surprised. This is a strange custom. The cup is only allowed to be used once, and the snacks are not allowed to be left over. What is the reason? I remember that Japan has this custom. The way they use chopsticks is that they must use new ones for every meal. The chopsticks are made of poplar wood, which is very light and easy to break, like using toothpicks. But from my experience, it's only big hotels that show off. I often stay in small rental houses, and I see that the owners don't do that. Why is it that Indians' clay cups are only used to drink water once and not a second time? I asked a gentleman. He replied that this is Hinduism. It is for hygiene reasons. Cups used by the living cannot be used indiscriminately, so they are discarded. Food left over by the living cannot be eaten, so it is discarded. Due to different customs, there may be infectious diseases, so people dare not enter the homes of others lightly to eat and drink. I believe that these things are mostly suggested by religious people to reject other religions, which only increases social taboos and obstacles. If it is really for hygiene, I dare to say that it is not true. There are many taboos, and people dare not contact others, which is not suitable for today's world. I realized why the ethnic groups in Southeast Asian countries have not been able to assimilate for thousands of years, which is due to the taboos of each religion and ethnic group. Today, the world is becoming one, and there will inevitably be a day to sweep away and eliminate these things. How can these bad customs be allowed to exist? Entering a village, one must ask about the customs, which also makes us feel helpless. In short, Indian customs make us feel like we are lost in a fog, which is very difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Gold Market Soars</p>
<p>Big Players Frenziedly Buy, Weak Ones Anxious</p>
<p>Very Strong Buying Sentiment: Yesterday, the gold price rose fiercely and unstoppably on the 22nd. The situation was sharp, rushing forward. From morning to noon, there were as many as sixteen or seventeen fluctuations. The backwardation also accounted for eight or nine taels. In the end, it rose almost twenty taels. It was indeed the result of speculative big players such as Luo and Lu actively covering short positions. Each exchange demanded more than it could supply, causing people's hearts to be stirred up. Only the Ningbo gang and hedgers sold out. Although overseas silver prices had fallen quite a bit, the initial opening was slightly lower. Afterwards, Qiang Changxiang, Chang Sheng, Yong Cui Chang, and Yong Fen bought. Yuan Sheng, Xin Heng, Sen Chang Yong, and others heavily shorted. Although the exchange rate initially had no change, it then narrowed by half a grade, both officially and unofficially tightening. Thus, a peak suddenly appeared, soaring ten taels. It was also heard that a certain British bank had suspended operations in New York, making drafts even more profitable. The gold price had already exceeded 730 taels, but only fluctuated by two or three taels. There was no special change in the backwardation. The drafts lacked a market because it was Wednesday. Later, Qiang Changxiang, Xin Heng, and others continued to advance tirelessly, reaching a high rise, almost soaring straight up. It suddenly rose to the 740 tael mark, and the shorts were greatly hit, all looking worried. It is said that the large silver bars will continue to decline this morning.</p>
<p>Morning Market Advances Step by Step: The opening price for the June contract this morning fell by 1.5 taels to 718.5 taels because the large silver bars only fell by one-sixteenth, the silver price was low by one-eighth, the private telegrams were the same, and the European market was very flat. Soon after, Qiang Changxiang, Chang Sheng Yong, and others bought in, and it immediately rose, rising by more than seven taels, with a difference of only one tael. Because British gold was still strong, each bank had sold at 1.375, and then bought in at the same price, so at 9:20 it was 26 taels, when Yuan Mao Yong and others sold out. Mitsui also sold British gold for June and July at 1.375, which has already suppressed it by a little over two taels. When the first order was announced, it did not change, being 24 taels and 2 qian. After that, British gold only settled at 4.375 to 3.75, because Xin Heng, Cui Chang Yong, Yu Da Yi Feng Yong Yuan Cheng and others successively purchased, causing it to rise to six taels. At 10 o'clock, British gold suddenly showed a contraction of 1.25, US gold of 0.25, and Japanese gold increased by 1.25 fen, immediately rising to 31 taels. Soon after, Wan Xing, Shun Li, and Fu Chang sold out, and at 10:11 it was 29 taels. In a moment, it rose to 31.5 taels, when Tian Feng, Yong Da, Xing Yong, and others bought in. Subsequently, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, Wan Xing, and others continued to sell without stopping, exchanging into British gold and hedging out silver bars. At 10:30 it was 28 taels. Later, Yuan Cheng, Heng Yu, Tian Yu Yong, and others aggressively purchased, so the winds and clouds gathered, and it rose upwards again, breaking through the 30 tael mark again. It was also heard that there was talk of an American merchant bank going bankrupt. In addition, British gold had been sold by Sumitomo, Zhengjin, and HSBC at 3.125, so the gold price rose again by four or five taels. At 11:15, it was 35 taels. Then, Zhi Feng, Yong Fu Chang, Shun Li, and others sold out, and it sharply dropped by four taels. At noon, it was 31 taels. When the market closed at 32 taels, it continued to rise by about two taels. The initial announced price was 765 taels, deducting 40 taels to 35 taels. Later, it was changed to 771 taels, deducting 40 taels to 26-27 taels. Consultation at noon for 40 taels.</p>
<p>Results Continue to Progress: The backwardation opened at 33 taels, followed by 32 taels. The Indian exchange telegraphic transfers decreased slightly by four or five annas, and then increased to 33.5 taels. Soon after, it returned to one anna, and with Wan Xing and others selling out, it fell to 31.5 qian. However, since it was Wednesday, there was no market for various exchanges, so the situation was peaceful. Until around 3 o'clock, Qiang Changxiang and others entered the market to chase higher prices, and Xin Heng and other exchanges also followed suit, so the price jumped as much as eight or nine taels, and 40 taels suddenly appeared. After 4 o'clock, Yuan Heng, Shun Li, Wan Xing, and others still sold, falling to 38.23 qian. It rose again to 40 taels. Fu Yu and others came to sell, slightly frustrated by about two taels. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 39.1 qian, a sharp increase of 19.1 qian compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 40 taels, and the minimum price was 18.5 taels, a backwardation of 21.5 qian. The spot price in the early market was 19.8 qian, the noon closing was 32.3 qian, the afternoon was 2.5 qian, and the market closing was 39 taels. The announced price was a deduction of 31-32 taels. The book price was 30 taels to 32 taels in the morning and 37 taels to 39 taels in the afternoon. The water supplement was 26 taels, and 33 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Speculative Tendency to Buy: Transaction statistics for each exchange. Cui Chang Yong, Yu Da, Fu Xing Yong, Yi Yu, Da Xing Yong, Tian Yu Yong, Chang Sheng Yong, Qiang Changxiang, Tong Tai Chang, Yi Feng Yong, Tian Feng Yong, etc. all bought.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Exceptionally Tight</h3>
<p>Listed Price Narrows Again by Half a Grade… Chinese Merchants Heavily Cover Short Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, Indian, and silver markets all fell again, while exchange rates rose. HSBC's listed price initially had no rise or fall.

After the initial flat and sharp morning session in the bank's internal market, the gold market turned from weak to strong, rushing to 740 taels. Big players fiercely covered short positions, with a glorious rise, so the noon closing for each exchange compared to the previous day saw British gold narrow by 0.25, US gold by 0.5 yuan, and Japanese gold increase by 2.25 fen, officially and unofficially tightening. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was usually no market. Chinese merchants traded very actively, such as Qiang Changxiang, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, Sheng Da, Yu Feng Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Run Chang Yu, etc., all closing positions to cover previous shorts and hedging out gold. British gold traded for about 300,000 pounds. Banks such as HSBC, Mercer, Shanghai, Zhengjin, and Hua Bi all sold out, while Xing Ye, Mitsui, and Korea slightly absorbed. As for US gold, a small number of positions were closed, and only tens of thousands of yuan were closed in Japanese exchange.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Flat and Lifeless</p>
<p>The yarn market is still weak. The situation of Shanghai raw cotton yarn has turned downstream again, causing people's hearts to soften. The selling pressure is particularly heavy. A large number of retail investors are selling short, and their intentions are extremely strong. As the period is gradually coming to an end and the coarse yarn business is sluggish, they must sell when prices rise. The market is temporarily forced down, but the actual sales of the Sichuan gang are rising as the war can be declared peaceful. Now, 1,200 packs have been removed, and the gold price has also risen, so the attitude of the big players is still calm, and there is no intention to let go. Judging from the overall situation of the yarn market, there should be a possibility of stabilization. However, the surrounding environment is bad, and it is difficult to prosper. There may be great changes in the future.</p>
<p>People's Standard Soft Decline: The opening of the People's Standard market in the early session. American cotton fell again, and people's hearts were very weak. The market atmosphere was bleak and lifeless, each falling by four or five qian. In the second and third sessions, the gold price rose, and people's morale was slightly boosted, with near-term prices rising by one, two, or three qian and long-term prices falling by one, two, or three qian. According to the transaction statistics for the whole day, 13,650 packs were traded. Geng Feng sold 1,100 packs, Tian Long sold 400 packs, and Sen Kang sold 550 packs. Rong Xing bought 450 packs, Shen Da bought 500 packs, Chang Feng bought 700 packs, Shen Da bought 750 packs, Yi Yu bought 550 packs, and Xin Hua bought 650 packs.

<h3>Cotton Market Declines Slightly</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly tired. American and Indian cotton trends have fallen again, causing people's hearts to be scattered and the market situation to be tired. However, the Japanese merchants' attitude is still strong and they are unwilling to relax, and the gold price has turned to the peak again, so most people dare not rashly sell short, because the base goods are too dry. However, the current cotton business is bleak, and the future still depends on the exchange rate and American cotton for progress and retreat.</p>
<p>Han Standard Declines Slightly by One or Two Qian: The opening of the Han Standard market in the early session. The market atmosphere was still tight. Later, there were more sellers, and the near-term price fell by one qian to one qian and five fen. The market atmosphere was still loose in the afternoon, each falling by one qian to one qian and five fen. According to the transaction statistics, 44,100 dan were traded.

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Clear Weather Turns Rice Market Weak</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, about 20 boats from various guilds arrived. Market sales weakened after the weather cleared up after the Tian Gong (fair). Northern guilds' high-quality white japonica rice showed signs of weakening. Medium and lower grades of japonica rice softened in price. Overall market trading was sluggish, and the market was not vibrant. Buying interest in Bo Dao (thin-husked) rice was mediocre. Inventory was not thick, and the market was slightly depressed. Yang Du and Xianbu indica rice suddenly presented a stagnant situation. Buyers paid little attention, so few transactions occurred. Bai Yuan (white yuan rice) arrivals and sales were evenly matched, and there was no advantage or disadvantage.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, over ten boats were seen arriving at the river. Sales on this street turned sluggish. Changshu and Suzhou japonica rice were still firm in the early morning but then turned flat. Towards the closing market, the outgoing path was increasingly stagnant, with signs of weakening. Southern guilds' Bo Zao (thin early) rice's top-grade goods were quite popular, while ordinary grades were unsatisfactory. The general trend was high and firm, while secondary grades were stable. Yang Du and other sharp-edged customers' guilds had weak appetites, and retail sales were also average, with little price fluctuation. Bian Yuan (varied yuan rice) turned yin (negative), showing a state of arriving little and selling slowly. Except for high-quality goods with active and flat prices, the rest were slightly reduced in price. The overall market's negative opening was only 9 yuan and 6-7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian (Guest Indica) Market Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's guest indica rice market was exceptionally quiet. Because the Guangdong guild stopped trading, other local guests had no appetite. There were still a few Jiangxi rice stocks. Apart from the company's own carload goods, the guest merchants mostly did not inquire. The remaining stocks of Jiangxi rice were not much, and the cargo owners were quite speculative. However, with few goods, it was difficult to choose, and the guest guilds watched, so the market price was ultimately difficult to rise. Throughout the day, only the Beiyang guild purchased over 50 packages of Jiangxi Zhongguanji rice, priced at 13 yuan. There were no other transactions. However, the local guests still had a good appetite for guest yuan rice, only disliking the low inventory and poor quality, unable to fully enjoy and purchase, it was said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Initially Flat, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed signs of initially being flat and then falling in the morning and afternoon sessions. The market in the current month initially opened well, followed by the fact that although some of the goods for delivery in the current month failed to meet the standards and were withdrawn, a few had already agreed to mutually deduct the standards. Therefore, the long side seemed unable to compete with the short side, so it fell again and again, dropping as much as 7 cents compared to the previous day's closing. The various far-term months were initially stable, but later, due to the clear weather and the hedging sales of traders, the market also showed signs of weakening. Observing the subsequent steps, it may still be flat and weak. As a result, the current month fell 7 cents compared to the previous day, May and June fell 5 cents, July fell 6 cents, August fell 5 cents, and September fell 3 cents, it was said.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Market Difficult to Escape Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a trend of initially weakening and then becoming buoyant after the opening of the morning session. Because foreign wheat was reported to be good, there were fluctuations of one or two jiao. The greater impulse was due to the sudden rain the previous day, and yesterday it cleared up. Some people inevitably changed due to the rain, so the opening was slightly lower by nearly a cent. Later, speculative longs became active again, so the near and far terms recovered and stabilized. When the afternoon session opened, the appetite of the Tianjin guild had not yet been activated, and the local spot flour was also slightly lower by one cent (3 yuan and 9 cents), so people were generally sluggish. Observing the subsequent steps, it is feared that the environment will become unfavorable again, and it is also unknown whether the far term will return to the 2 tael mark. As a result, the current month was down by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, May was down by 1 cent, and June to September were down by 1.25 li.</p>
<h3>Soybean Futures Trended Soft in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dalian standard soybeans opened extremely well. The near and far term months were inquired by guest guilds and factories, so the current month once reached 4 taels and 7 qian. Currently, the exchange has traded a large amount of over a thousand carloads. Although they are transported from Dalian Wuzhuang, Yingkou, etc., because of the risk of substandard goods, people are extremely cautious. When the afternoon session opened, the telegraph from Dalian reported a decrease of 9 fen, so the market turned soft, and the price changed from firm to weak. As a result, the April term was 4 taels and 6 qian and 8 fen, and the June term was 4 taels and 6 qian and 6 fen, both down by 1 fen, while the May term was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Following Foreign Exchange, Rising Gradually</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: Cuban spot sugar prices unchanged. New York sugar futures: only September unchanged, the remaining months each down by 1 cent. Java spot and futures sugar also still without rise or fall. The public association market opened trading, and with foreign exchange prices rising, sentiment became stronger and the market rose gradually. Dutch sugar 24th grade coarse white sugar traded at 10 taels and 05 qian. Although the transaction volume was not large, the market was still firm. 20th grade medium white sugar also followed the rise to 10 taels. Japanese sugar trading was very active, and prices also rose gradually. YT mark 10 taels 04 qian 2.5 fen, YRO mark 9 taels 9 qian 5 fen, Minghua goods 9 taels 9 qian 2.5 fen, J mark 10 taels 09 qian, YP mark 10 taels 08 qian 5 fen, J mark X 10 taels 07 qian, TM mark 10 taels 01 qian 5 fen. The market shape was all upright and beautiful. Japanese sugar factory Yokohama sugar reply telegram has been transferred, the price increased by 5 fen. The total amount is estimated to be 20,000 bags. The intentions of Dan month's Xingxingfang to make a deal have not yet been reached, and no deal has been made. It is heard that the delivery will be made according to the previous arrangement, and the delivery date will be changed to May and June, but it still needs a reply telegram to determine how it will be determined, it was said.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea</h3>
<p>Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Difficult to Turn Around</p>
<p>The local foreign firms' silk market still lacks the possibility of a turnaround. The overseas Chinese silk factories' sales are still sluggish, and the telegraphed prices are low. Chinese merchants value capital heavily, and the losses are too great, so silk sales are difficult to be smooth. Yesterday, only Hexing, etc., purchased 30 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, Anli purchased 10 packages of yellow factory silk, and Baili purchased 15 packages of yellow coarse silk. The prices were all flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Tung Oil Gradually Arriving</p>
<p>Tung oil sells well in summer and autumn, but the so-called stocking in spring, the sales field is not less than in midsummer. This spring, because the inventory at the end of last winter was thin, those who need goods were eagerly waiting. However, the origin is far away in southern Hunan, and transportation takes time. Since the beginning of spring, there has been a risk of interruption between Hankou and Shanghai. Until half a month ago, a batch was transported from Hankou, about several hundred barrels. It is heard that the total number is in the two or three thousand, and they can all arrive in succession. The arriving brands are Wanxingyu, Zhentaiheng, Jifengheng, Jitaiheng, Jishengheng, Jiqingheng, etc. There is also the Dayouheng brand, because the output is only several hundred barrels, it needs to be shipped out in the next batch, and it is not known when it will arrive. The customer price has been opened: Wanxingyu 28 taels and 8 qian, Zhentaiheng and Jifengheng 28 taels and 4 qian, and the rest are reduced according to the brand. Not many goods have arrived, and demand exceeds supply. It has been sold out in a few days.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Issues</h3>
<p>Customs Gold Unit Exchange Certificates</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen Speaks</p>
<p>Issued on May 1st of this Year</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen spoke about the Central Bank's issuance of Customs Gold Unit exchange certificates yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>The bank, under government order, will issue Customs Gold Unit exchange certificates starting May 1st of this year. The issuance of these Customs Gold Unit exchange certificates is intended to facilitate the payment of customs duties by importers in Shanghai or other ports. Currently, importers pay customs duties by temporarily converting silver dollars to pay taxes, except for those who have Customs Gold Unit deposits in the Central Bank and can issue checks at any time to pay. From now on, they can directly pay with Customs Gold Unit exchange certificates or Customs Gold Unit checks, which is more convenient. It is even more convenient in ports where the Central Bank does not have branches. These Customs Gold Unit exchange certificates have full reserves. The types of reserves, cash on hand or foreign gold coins, should be at least 60% or more. The rest can be filled with bank acceptance drafts or gold bonds with good foreign credit. Upon exchange, the Central Bank will issue immediate bank drafts in foreign financial markets for exchange. However, when the Customs Gold Unit is less than 1,000 yuan, the Central Bank can exchange it for silver dollars at the market rate of the day. As for the amount of issuance and reserves, the bank will still follow the silver dollar exchange certificate method, and publish it in the newspaper after the audit by the board of supervisors every ten days to show credit. The current supervisors of the bank are Li Ming, Wang Jingli, Qin Runqing, Lin Kanghou, Ju Zuyi, Yu Qiaqing, and Xu Chenmian. Furthermore, the government has ordered that the right to issue these Customs Gold Unit exchange certificates belongs exclusively to the Central Bank, it was said.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Publicly Elected Office</h3>
<p>Announced National Assembly Representatives</p>
<p>Electoral Groups: 80 Electoral Units, 48,987 Voters</p>
<p>Chen Guansheng, Hou Dachun, Wang Yansong, and Hu Shuhua Elected</p>
<p>The election of representatives to the National Assembly in this city ended yesterday. The staff mobilized by the publicly elected office has ceased to work at the office yesterday, leaving only a few people to conclude unfinished matters. The list of elected representatives was officially announced by the office yesterday. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Number of Electors: The number of groups participating in the election this time includes: 7 agricultural associations, with 3,156 electors; 49 labor unions, with 34,179 electors; 1 commercial association, with 388 electors; 23 free professional groups, universities, and educational associations, with a total of 1,164 electors. The total number of groups is 80, with 48,987 electors.</p>
<p>Difficulties: The number of electors in this election was not strong, and the reasons are: (1) The labor union was just reorganized on March 15 and was in the process of sorting out its affairs and reporting the electoral registers, which was not enough time. Therefore, it was not a small number of those who reported only a part. (2) There were no organizations for agricultural and educational associations in this city until the end of this month, when several places were established. (3) Among the free professional groups, some gave up on their own, and some were unable to participate in the election because the organization was not prepared. (4) The number of electors represented by the commercial association should be more than 45,000, but the electors represented are only the representatives of the trade and shop guilds attending the commercial association. If the agricultural, educational, and labor unions had been reorganized and completed earlier, the number of electors in this city would have been at least 230,000.</p>
<p>Elected Representatives: Chen Guansheng of the Agricultural Association, with 1,796 votes, the next largest number of votes was Chen Tianxi with 19 votes; Hou Dachun of the Labor Union, with 14,442 votes, the next largest number of votes was Wang Zhuping with 1,426 votes; Wang Yansong of the Commercial Association, with 169 votes, the next largest number of votes was Xu Jimiao with 3 votes; Hu Shuhua of the Free Professional Groups, Universities, and Educational Associations, with 2,653 votes, the next largest number of votes was Zheng Yuxiu with 336 votes.</p>
<p>Notification of Election: The election office in this city, in addition to publishing the names of the elected representatives with the most votes in the newspaper, and sending a telegram to the general office, also notified the elected representatives, it was said.</p>
<h3>Follow-up Report on the</h3>
<p>Huayang Run Aground</p>
<p>Hope of Saving the Hull Seems Lost</p>
<p>Crew and Passengers Safe Uphill</p>
<p>Loaded onto Chengli Wheel to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Hang'an Company's Huayang steamship encountered fog and ran aground on the Haishan Island in Wenzhou. The report was already published yesterday. Regarding the rescue situation of the steamship, our reporter conducted a thorough investigation from all aspects. After the accident, all the crew and passengers escaped to the reef mountain by small sampans, so they were safe and sound. However, the hull was damaged by the reef and could not be towed for rescue. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>True Picture of the Accident: This time, the Huayang steamship left Shanghai on the afternoon of the 20th and set sail for Xinghua. On the afternoon of the 21st, at 2:30 pm, when it was traveling to the vicinity of Nan Yushan reef, 90 nautical miles from Haishan Island, Wenzhou, the steamship encountered heavy fog. The owner of the ship, W. Sokoloff, a Russian, intended to anchor and take temporary shelter, but it was too late. The hull immediately hit the mountain reef. Although the extent of the damage was not mentioned in the telegram, it seems that the bottom of the ship has been set into the reef and seawater rushed into the various cabins, the situation is very critical. The time of the accident was 2:30 pm.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships First Rescued: The first distress telegram sent by the owner of the ship was received by the Tientien Beienke steamship of Tianshang Foreign Firm. Then the Gongping Wheel received it. At 4:35 pm on the 21st, the Tianshang Wheel first opened to Haishan Island to carry out the rescue. However, the fog was too great to advance, so the steamship sent a telegram to Shanghai, briefly stating that Huayang was 90 miles away from Haishan Island, and we had come to rescue, but the fog was very heavy, etc. At 5:30 pm, Gongping also arrived, but because the draft was too deep, it was impossible to get close, and the fog also covered the sea, making it difficult to release the sampan. It was helpless to look at the sea and sigh.</p>
<p>Passengers Aboard the Mountain: After the Huayang steamship ran aground, there were about 130 crew members and passengers. The ship owner and the comprador Yue Yaosheng, etc., took life jackets and released the sampan boats, first carrying the passengers on board to Nan Yu reef in batches for temporary refuge. According to reports, on the afternoon of the 21st, all the ship's staff and passengers had safely ascended the mountain without anyone being injured. It was also a great fortune in misfortune.</p>
<p>Degree of Grounding: Yesterday, the Hang'an Company also received a telegram from the English steamship stating that the Huayang accident site was designated by the 300th in the navigation warning table, the grounding site was at 18 degrees north latitude and 6 degrees west longitude. At 2:35 pm, another telegram was received from the Gongping, saying that the Huayang steamship was grounded, the place name was Nan Yu Mountain, close to Haishan Island, and there was no way to rescue it. Gongping was short of water and planned to find another solution.</p>
<p>British Ships Assist: The British Company's mail ship, Laganpura, was exported from Shanghai to England and heard the news of the Huayang accident while passing through the waters of Wenzhou, so it also sailed to Ma'an Island to help rescue. It arrived at Haishan Island at 11:00 am yesterday, first flying a flag to ask the Gongping Wheel, and the Gongping shipowner replied that all the Huayang crew members and passengers had been rescued to Nan Yu Mountain, and the company had sent another ship to rescue.</p>
<p>Two Ships to the Rescue: Yesterday morning, because Hang'an Company received a telegram from Gongping stating that the steamship lacked food and drinking water and could not rescue, it asked the local Shunan Wheel Company to send a telegram to the Fusheng Wheel on the same route to sail to the rescue. At that time, the Fusheng Wheel had returned from Xinghua and had arrived at Wusong, without entering the port, it immediately turned back to Nan Yu Mountain. At the same time, it negotiated with the Zhengji Company, asking it to telegram the Chengli Wheel, which was currently in Wenzhou, to sail nearby to help the rescue. After the two ships were dispatched, at 2:53 pm, another telegram was received from the Gongping, saying that this steamship could not stay for a long time due to lack of furnace water. The British mail ship had arrived at the scene of the Huayang accident and was anchored to protect it. The Chengli Wheel will arrive at 3:00 pm, and the passengers and crew members on the mountain will be rescued by the Chengli Wheel's sampan boat and taken back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Dispatch a Warship to Protect: After Jianghai Customs was notified by the coastal radio station, it dispatched the Liujing warship yesterday morning to protect the area. The manager of Hang'an, Huang Xingge, in order to protect the passengers, goods, and prevent pirates from looting, especially went to the Naval Headquarters to request the dispatch of a warship to protect the area. The naval authorities have agreed to send a telegram to the Yongjian warship stationed in Ningbo to sail nearby to protect the stranded steamship.</p>
<p>Ship and Cargo Losses: The Huayang Wheel was originally owned by Wang Jiaojang. This year, it was purchased by Hang'an Company for 100,000 yuan. First, it was sent to the northern seas of Yantai, Tianjin, and Yingkou. Recently, it was transferred to Shanghai and Xinghua. It was only the third time it had sailed after being purchased. The steamship had a deadweight of 1,600 tons, and the hull was insured by the bureau itself. The export goods loaded in Shanghai this time included 1,200 tons of soybeans, soybean cakes, piece goods, raw oil, kerosene, and groceries. It is heard that the hull has been destroyed and there is no hope of saving it. It will be abandoned. According to the person in charge of the company, the first priority is to rescue the crew members and passengers, and the second is to unload the goods in order to protect the capital of the merchants. The crew members' luggage and passengers' belongings, etc., were not able to be taken out and were completely sacrificed. Therefore, although the Huayang accident did not harm any lives, the public and private losses were very huge. As for the victims, it is expected that they will be rescued back to Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>180 Local</h3>
<p>Trade Associations' Declaration</p>
<p>Support the Central Government's Implementation of the Business Tax Plan</p>
<p>Must be Equal Between Chinese and Foreign, and Chinese Rentals Uniform</p>
<p>The local North-South Goods Dismantling and Exchange Industry, Wood Industry, Native Cloth Industry, Fruit and Local Goods Industry, Kerosene Industry, Ice-Fresh Fish Industry, North Goods Industry, Western Clothing Industry, Local Goods Industry, Pawnshop Industry, Money Industry, Department Store Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Soybean and Rice Industry, Gold Industry, Paint Industry, Woolen Fabric Factory Industry, South Goods Industry, Tea Industry, Duck Slaughtering Industry, Knitting Industry, Seafood Grocery Industry, Firewood and Coal Industry, Egg Industry, Chinese Medicine Industry, New Medicine Industry, Chinese Soap Industry, Chinese Candle Industry, Chinese Grain and Oil Cake Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Shoe, Leather, Nail and Shoe Tree Industry, Sausage Industry, Tobacco Leaf Industry, Tobacco Exchange Industry, Electrical Machinery and Silk Factory Industry, Coal Industry, Fur Industry, Jewelry Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Sauce Garden Industry, Securities Industry, Medicinal Materials Industry, Foil Industry, Ham Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Insurance Industry, etc., 180 trade associations, issued an announcement yesterday regarding the matter of supporting the central government's promotion of business tax negotiations, saying: "Stealing the principle of tax law, the first lies in equality. All those who operate the same business in the same region should bear the same tax rate. It is the law of nature and what should be done. Therefore, the prerequisite issues for organizing business tax in this city are (1) equality between Chinese and foreigners, and (2) uniform Chinese rentals, so as to avoid the disadvantages of uneven light and heavy taxation, and not to make concessions and nominally foreign shops, serve as the act of crows gathering and scaring sparrows. Now, on the 16th of this month, reading the newspaper and carrying the Beijing telegram, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that all Chinese and foreign merchants in the concessions of various countries should pay the business tax levied by our country in accordance with the regulations and must not resist. It can be seen that our central government has insight into power and justice, and upholds the utmost fairness. The various trade associations are willing to uphold the sincerity of patriotism and support the central government's negotiations to promote business tax. Shanghai has special circumstances and cannot be compared with other provinces and cities. Before this negotiation is settled, our wise municipal authorities should not bear to impose partial taxation on our Chinese community and our Chinese merchants alone. This is a declaration, I hope you will understand."</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Talks About Wharf Dues</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government is Negotiating with the Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>It Can Be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>Regarding the recovery of wharf dues, the municipal government has completed negotiations with the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession. Wharf dues have been collected by the Jianghai Customs on behalf of the government, amounting to more than 1 million yuan per year, all of which are handed over to the Public Concession and the French Concession Bureau. The municipal government only receives 10,000 yuan per year. Now, the municipal government has agreed with the British and French concessions on the recovery method. All wharf dues are still collected by the Jianghai Customs on behalf of the government. As for the distribution method, those belonging to the Public Concession and the French Concession, the dues will be handed over to the two Concession Bureaus. Those belonging to the Chinese territory, such as the wharf dues of Nanshi, Pudong, and Jiangxin, will be completely allocated to the municipal government. In this way, the municipal government can increase its revenue by more than 700,000 yuan per year. Our reporter especially met with Mayor Zhang Qun yesterday. According to reports, regarding the issue of recovering wharf dues, the municipal government has signed a contract with the two Concession Bureaus, and is now directly negotiating with the Jianghai Customs on future collection procedures. It is rumored that the Ministry of Finance will issue a transfer order, which is not true. It is expected that a complete agreement can be reached in these few days, and it is hoped that it can be implemented starting from May. Furthermore, because Mr. Zhang was newly appointed as the director of the National Assembly Reception, he took the 11:45 pm night train to Beijing last night to negotiate everything and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 25th.</p>

<h3>Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Article 10 of the Detailed Rules for the Trade Association Law</p>
<p>Telegram from the National Federation of Commerce</p>
<p>Requesting Expression of Opinions from All Parties</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to all chambers of commerce nationwide, stating: "It has been found that the Ministry of Industry has revised Article 10 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Trade Association Law, which reads: 'Article 10: Members under Article 7 of this Law, each company or firm may send one or two representatives, limited to managers or principals. If the average number of shop employees exceeds ten in the most recent year, one additional representative should be sent, to be elected by the shop employees of the respective company or firm, but not exceeding three representatives in total.' This Federation believes that the amendment of this article poses a significant impediment to the fundamental organization of trade associations and chambers of commerce. On March 7th, we submitted a telegram in lieu of a formal report to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting its correction. The telegram stated: 'We have found that Article 10 of the revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Trade Association Law stipulates that members' representatives under Article 7 of this Law, each company or firm may send one or two representatives, limited to managers or principals. However, if the average number of employees used in the most recent year is fifteen or more, one additional representative may be sent, to be elected by the employees of the respective company or firm.' Recently, the latter half of this article has been amended to: 'However, if the average number of employees used in the most recent year exceeds ten, one additional representative may be sent, to be elected by the employees of the respective company or firm, but not exceeding three representatives in total.' It has been found that in commercial ports and metropolitan areas, companies and firms with thirty or more employees account for over sixty percent. According to this article, the managers and principals who are trade association member representatives would only account for two-fifths, while the employees would account for three-fifths. During discussions and voting, employees would inevitably hold an absolute majority. Shop owners and shop employees have different positions, and disputes are bound to arise. This would nominally be a trade association but would effectively be an employee association, which is likely not the original intent of the state in creating the Trade Association Law. We earnestly request that the Ministry of Industry be instructed to amend the article back to: 'Each company or firm should send one or two member representatives, limited to managers or principals. If the average number of employees used in the most recent year is fifteen or more, one additional member representative may be sent, to be elected by the employees.' This would prevent the reversal of roles between owners and employees and ensure the prosperity of both industry and commerce, which is our sincere plea.'" After the submission, on April 2nd, the Executive Yuan issued Decree No. 114, stating: "The telegram in lieu of a formal report is noted. This case has been referred to the Ministry of Industry for review. According to their response, the amendment of the article was initiated by the Central Training Department, based on four excerpts of summaries prepared by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters on the reorganization of trade unions in the city, requesting the enactment of regulations for the organization of shop employees. It was deemed relevant to the aforementioned laws and regulations, and the Ministry was requested to send representatives to a meeting. It was resolved to amend Article 10 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation to provide more opportunities for shop employees to participate in group organizations. In addition to being promulgated and circulated by the Ministry, it has also been submitted to the Yuan for onward submission to the National Government for record. The request for amendment cannot be approved." Based on this, it is found that the deliberations are generally appropriate and should be approved accordingly. Aside from issuing instructions, this decree is issued for notification. According to the revised articles of the Ministry of Industry, company and firm representatives attending trade associations, managers, and principals would only number two, while employees would number three, representing a ratio of two-fifths to three-fifths. By this analogy, employees will inevitably constitute an absolute majority in trade associations, while managers and principals will constitute a minority. Regardless of proposals or voting, the rights of employees will inevitably outweigh those of managers and principals. Nominally, this would be a trade association, but in reality, it would be an association of factory workers and shop employees. This not only contradicts the original legislative intent of the Trade Association Law but also differs in nature. With differing interests, conflicts will inevitably occur from time to time, and disputes will inevitably arise, which is one concern. Chambers of commerce are based on trade associations, and trade associations elect representatives to participate in chambers of commerce. As member representatives, they will invariably be factory workers and shop employees who are elected. Assembling factory workers and shop employees from various trade associations to form a chamber of commerce would effectively make the chamber of commerce a general assembly of factory workers and shop employees. Not only would the chamber of commerce exist in name only, contradicting the original legislative intent of the Chamber of Commerce Law, but there is also the concern that a</p>

<p>region's own businesses would lack a body for collective deliberation and expression of views. The thirty-plus year history of chambers of commerce would inevitably come to an end, which would be unfortunate not only for the business community but also for the government. This is another concern. The two aforementioned points relate to the fundamental organization of the Trade Association Law and the Chamber of Commerce Law and represent a matter of life and death for the business community nationwide. It seems imperative to make a thorough effort to strive for amendment in order to achieve the goal of revision. This is a corresponding telegram for your information. It is hoped that you will promptly express your opinions and telegram the Central Government to appeal for approval of the amendment. The situation is urgent, and we earnestly hope for its implementation. Respectfully submitted by Lin Kanghou, Chairman; Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangxu, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, and others of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Certifies White Case as Baseless</h3>
<p>Bai Zhiying Trafficking Drugs is a Rumor</p>
<p>Hong Kong Customs Responsible for Certification</p>
<p>Huang Jiaohui, Director-General of the China National Anti-Narcotics Association, previously traveled to Taiwan with his wife, Dr. Bai Zhiying, to inspect the opium prohibition situation. Suddenly, rumors were fabricated, claiming that Huang's wife was trafficking morphine and was apprehended by Hong Kong Customs, which was publicized both domestically and internationally. After Huang and his wife returned from overseas, they repeatedly declared the claims to be false. The Anti-Narcotics Association and the Party Headquarters also issued statements on their behalf, confirming that they were falsely accused, and the truth has gradually become clear. It is reported that at the beginning of the month, Huang and his wife entrusted Mr. Pender Hake, barrister at the Gu Tai Public Law Office, and Messrs. Wilkinson and Grist, barristers in Hong Kong, to investigate with the Hong Kong government and obtain a certificate from Hong Kong Customs, proving that the matter of Mrs. Huang trafficking drugs was entirely untrue. The translation of the certificate from Mr. J.D. Lloyd, Superintendent of Imports and Exports of Hong Kong Customs, No. 189, dated April 15, to Messrs. Wilkinson and Grist, barristers in Hong Kong, is as follows: "We acknowledge receipt of your letter inquiring whether there is any basis for rumors regarding Dr. Bai Zhiying trafficking morphine. We hereby reply as follows: Hong Kong Customs has not recently apprehended any case of smuggling morphine involving a Chinese woman. Furthermore, a review of reports from past years, such as 1927, 1928, 1929, up to the present, shows no such cases involving Chinese women. This is hereby certified." Furthermore, the investigation report from Messrs. Wilkinson and Grist, barristers in Hong Kong, to Mr. Hake, barrister at the Guwo Public Law Office, is excerpted as follows: "We were entrusted to visit and inquire with the Chinese Customs Tax Commissioner in Hong Kong regarding the rumors of Mrs. Huang trafficking drugs. According to the Tax Commissioner, I also received a request from a supervisor of a certain Chinese Customs to investigate this case, but the investigation revealed no evidence of Dr. Bai Zhiying smuggling morphine. Our lawyers immediately visited and inquired with the Superintendent of Imports and Exports of Hong Kong Customs, who stated that the Customs had no evidence of Bai Zhiying trafficking drugs. In fact, since 1927, this Customs has not apprehended any case of smuggling narcotics involving a Chinese woman. We are enclosing the certificate from Mr. Lloyd, the Customs Superintendent." It is reported that the Anti-Narcotics Association is preparing to make a large-scale exoneration for Mr. and Mrs. Huang. Mr. and Mrs. Huang are also planning to invite domestic and foreign journalists in the coming days to announce the truth of the false accusations.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County County Administration Meeting</h3>
<p>Sixty-first Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its sixty-first County Administration Meeting yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. Those in attendance included County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, Construction Bureau Director Wu Wenhua, Finance Bureau Director Wang Li (represented by Zhang Pengfei), Education Bureau Director Shi She, County Secretary Ye Dezhen, and Section Chiefs Yu Meifen, etc. After the meeting commenced, County Magistrate Yan presided, and Hu Gongshou recorded the proceedings. Matters for discussion included: (1) As per the order of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, promoting afforestation activities, each county should establish at least one nursery. How should this county comply? Resolved: Five mu of land within the new county government base will be allocated to establish a nursery, to be managed by the Guqiao Farmers' Education Center. The expenses will be proposed to the Department from the education reserve fund. The meeting was adjourned after the resolution.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Export Duties on Native Cloth</h3>
<p>To be Submitted to the General Taxation and Customs Administrations for Approval</p>
<p>The exemption of export duties on native cloth, following requests from the Native Cloth Trade Association, the Yarn and Cloth Trade Association, and others to the General Taxation Administration, has already received verbal approval from Director Xie. These associations have also noted that the heavy tariffs levied on machine-made yarn and cloth are still reimbursed from the general taxation revenue, while native cloth, being a hand-woven product, is fundamentally exempt from general taxation, and thus the customs duty should also be completely exempt. Therefore, to achieve this goal, they yesterday contacted the General Taxation Administration on the one hand and planned to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance on the other. However, according to yesterday's contact, General Taxation Director Xie has already contacted Customs Director Zhang Fuyun, who has also agreed to the exemption. It is also heard that the two directors will jointly submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>Kailuan Failure to Resolve Order Disputes</h3>
<p>Request Submitted to the Social Bureau for Mediation</p>
<p>Kailuan Mining Not Shut Down</p>
<p>The Coal Trade Association, regarding the dispute over Kailuan Sales Office's failure to fulfill orders, was convened for mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 16th. However, the Kailuan Sales Office and four other firms, including Yuantai, were absent, resulting in no resolution. The Trade Association found it particularly difficult to cope with the demands of its members who were awaiting orders. In addition to purchasing other types of high-priced coal within the possible range to meet the needs of customers, they have urged the Social Bureau to schedule a meeting between both parties as soon as possible to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>The Kailuan Sales Office, according to the Tianjin Kailuan Mining Bureau, has stated that recent Shanghai newspapers carried Tianjin news reports stating that the bureau would suspend work in all its mining areas for four months starting April 20th, which is clearly a misrepresentation. All mining areas are currently operating as usual and have not suspended work.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Writes to Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Chinese Should Be Included in the Land Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement yesterday, stating: "Regarding your esteemed letter of April 14th in response to the unconditional collection of land taxes in the Yangshupu area, in addition to forwarding it to lawyers Ye and Yang, the Association should make the following statements: (1) Your Council did not pay attention to the meaning of 'if as stated in your letter' in the Association's letter of March 16th, which is regrettable because of the statement 'Your Council based your statement on one-sided reports, saying that the Bureau discriminates against the Chinese, which is regrettable.' (2) In the aforementioned letter, the Association mentioned the inclusion of two or three Chinese members in the Land Committee, originally hoping to eliminate the appearance of discrimination against the Chinese and to seek thorough measures to avoid discrimination against the Chinese, so as to avoid various misunderstandings that may lead to the perception of discrimination against the Chinese. However, the response did not mention this point at all, which failed to alleviate the concerns about the so-called non-discrimination against the Chinese. Accordingly, we hereby inform you, hoping that you will promptly consider the inclusion of Chinese in the local committee, so that this Association can be satisfied that there is no discrimination against the Chinese."</p>
<h3>Hat Industry Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The strike by workers from over ninety hat factories in the city, including Wancheng Hat Factory, has lasted for a long time. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs summoned the directors of the union the night before last, explained everything, and issued a notice to protect the resumption of work. As a result, all workers returned to the factory yesterday. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Authorities' Guidance: Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, summoned union directors Zhu Wenbiao and Zhao Xiangting to the Bureau on the evening of the 21st to question them because hat workers accused the employers of violating contracts and deducting wages, and went on strike. The employer representatives in charge had already admitted to fulfilling the contract, but the workers refused to return to work and even gathered to assault people, which was inappropriate. He also provided guidance and explanations on everything and ordered them to take responsibility and immediately persuade the workers to resume work. A notice has been issued to all workers to return to work and restore operations.</p>
<p>Notice of Resumption of Work: The Hat Industry Union issued a notice yesterday morning, stating: "Regarding the matter of notification, we have received the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs approval order No. 9252, which states, 'Your petition has been noted. It has been found that the employers in the industry have already admitted to fulfilling the contract regarding the wage issue, and they have also taken the initiative to publish a statement in the newspaper as requested, so there is no dispute to speak of. How can you repeatedly cause trouble on various pretexts? You must immediately instruct all workers to resume work by a set date and not delay or incur consequences.' Upon receiving this, we must notify everyone to be aware. All workers must comply and resume work by a set date, and do not delay or incur consequences. This is of utmost importance. This is hereby notified."</p>
<p>Protection of Work: The Shanghai Municipal Public Security and Social Bureau jointly issued a notice No. 9248 yesterday morning, stating: "Regarding the matter of joint issuance, the strike by hat workers in this case has been ongoing for many days. This Bureau of Social Affairs has previously issued a notice jointly with the Municipal Party Headquarters, limiting them to resume work within three days. If they dare to delay, it will be considered a voluntary dismissal. The deadline is approaching, and a joint notice is urgently issued. All workers in the industry must comply, resume work within the deadline, and not hesitate or be mistaken. Furthermore, the union official Wang Yuxiang, etc., because they led unemployed workers to go to various factories late at night and forcibly coerced workers who had already resumed work to strike, even assaulting and injuring people, have been investigated and dealt with by this Public Security Bureau. The workers are hereby instructed to resume work with peace of mind and not to worry. This is strictly notified."</p>
<h3>Customs Brokerage Industry Unlikely to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Customs Brokerage Union Persists in Old Rules</p>
<p>Requests Social Bureau to Implement and Promulgate Instructions</p>
<p>Customs brokerage workers in this city previously drafted a table of prices and short-distance agreements with three parties. However, after the Customs Brokerage Union and the Trade Association convened meetings for approval, all members opposed the establishment of a fee schedule and short-distance agreements, advocating that the fee for cotton cloth from this factory should be handled in accordance with the authorities' announcement, and the distance for the delivery of goods from the East and West Oceans should be handled according to the old rules. Therefore, the resumption of work is still unlikely for the time being. The Customs Brokerage Association has submitted a request to the Social Bureau for further mediation. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Union General Assembly: The Customs Brokerage Union held a general membership meeting at its headquarters in Panjia Lane yesterday morning at 9 a.m. to discuss the strike of cotton cloth and East-West Ocean goods. Over two hundred people attended including He Yumin, Sun Liansheng, Li Houfu, Su Houxin, Liang Jikang, Zhou Juxing, Ren Xinxiang, etc. Su Houxin was elected chairman, and Ren Xinxiang served as the recorder. The chairman reported on the cause of the strike, which was caused by the cotton cloth industry, causing repeated delays. Yesterday, the Social Bureau convened a mediation, and the three parties held consultations in the Zhaoshang Yu, and immediately resolved as follows: (1) Regarding the case of cotton cloth fees from this factory, all members advocated that in accordance with Social Bureau Announcement No. 9097, cotton cloth merchants who buy cloth from Haojia (trading houses) should pay an additional fee of 34 copper coins per piece in addition to the general tax payable, which should be transferred from the cotton cloth Hao merchants to the workers; (2) The distance for the delivery of East and West Ocean goods was from the east to Huishan Wharf, from the south to Dada Wharf, and from the west to Lihe Warehouses near Erbai Du Bridge before May 30th. After May 30th, it was from the east to Mitsubishi Wharf, from the south to Dada Wharf, and from the west to Lihe Warehouses. Moreover, this strike was entirely due to the issue of cotton cloth fees from this factory, which has nothing to do with the distance of East and West Ocean goods. The cotton cloth industry's proposed new distance table is obviously blackmail. It was resolved on the spot that the distance of East and West Ocean goods must be handled in accordance with the old rules.</p>
<p>Association General Assembly: The Customs Brokerage Trade Association held a general membership meeting at its association in Qingyunli, Shandong Road at 2 p.m. yesterday, attended by forty-two firms, including Wu Zhaohua of Tiantaiheng and Shi Zhibin of Yuanfeng Kunji. Chairman Shi Zhibin first reported on the recent situation of the strike of cotton cloth and East-West Ocean goods from this factory, as well as the mediation convened by the Social Bureau and the consultations that the three parties had conducted on their own. Then, discussions began: (1) Zhu Xieshen, representative of Xinyuanchang, proposed that although the newly opened Six Wharves followed the method before May 30th, the situation is different now than it was in the past. In the past, barges could be used, but now cars must be used. The amount stipulated in the newspaper cannot be recognized. I suggest that we still follow the method of dealing with Zhang. All members unanimously expressed their approval. (2) The chairman proposed that whether there are prices or open restrictions for open wharves should be discussed further. All members did not agree and could not sign any conditions with the Cotton Cloth Association. (3) Please discuss the issue of collecting wharf donations again. All members advocated that the old rules should still be followed and that the industry should not collect them. (4) It was decided that the only way is to list the various methods and present them to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for fair processing: (A) Cotton cloth from this factory and East-West Ocean goods cannot be combined into one place. Opening the wharf is a matter of foreign goods and has nothing to do with this dispute. (B) The collection of cartage by the Cotton Cloth Industry Association has been a custom for decades, how can it be overthrown suddenly? (C) Wharf donations, inspection fees, and stamp duty are outside the issue of cartage and have nothing to do with this strike fee, so they should not be mixed up. (D) The letters from the various customers indicate that the Hao merchants have expressed their desire to follow the past rules, so there should be no problem with the Cotton Cloth Association collecting the various fees, which can be used as an excuse. (E) In addition to the association's attempt to persuade the union to resume transportation, the Social Bureau should be requested to implement instructions, ordering the Cotton Cloth Association to follow the old rules and not change them. The resolution was passed. (5) Pan Mengkang, representative of Dachuantong, proposed that if cotton cloth brokers are willing to pay for cartage, customs brokerage workers should be asked to transport them as before. It was resolved that this should be done after the union representatives and all the workers have consulted.</p>
<h3>Jin Xin Labor Dispute to be Arbitrated Today</h3>
<p>The Jin Xin Silk Weaving Factory has been on strike for more than thirty days. The Municipal Government has scheduled arbitration for 2 p.m. today. The labor side has sent Zhao Ganchen and Ni Chengcai as representatives. The Jin Xin workers are also preparing to set off together on this day, hoping that the Municipal Government will resolve the issue as soon as possible and start work soon.</p>
<h3>Dayouyu Oil Factory Idling Dispute</h3>
<p>Mediated by the Social Bureau</p>
<p>The Dayouyu Oil Factory at No. 36 Suzhou River Road in Western Shanghai had a dispute with its workers idling on the job this month. The factory, unable to bear the losses, requested assistance from the competent authorities. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs scheduled mediation for the case the other day. Ling Wei Wu and Lin Xuezhi, representatives of the capital side, and Qiu Zhulian and Sun Kouming, representatives of the labor union, attended. Zhu Guilin was the chairman, and Wang Zhizhen was the recorder. After a long discussion, four items of settlement were signed: (1) If the factory lacks raw materials, it may adjust shifts as necessary. (2) If the number of 15 vehicles is reduced to 10, the 15 workers will be distributed among the shifts to work on average. When it is reduced to five vehicles, the next hand will be temporarily suspended from work. (3) The above measures will last until the end of the autumn inventory. (4) In the future, workers' work should be based on the normal production volume as a standard, and should not be intentionally reduced.</p>
<h3>Accountants Association General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association held a spring general membership meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association yesterday. The standing committee members of the presidium were Xi Yushu, Wang Haifan, and Jiang Wanping. The meeting opened as usual. Chairman Xi Yushu delivered the opening remarks, Standing Committee Member Jiang Wanping reported on the progress of the association's affairs, Accounting Committee Member Wang Haifan presented various accounting documents and reported on the income and expenditure situation. Supervisory Committee Member Xu Yongzu reported on the supervision of the association's affairs and finances, and Supervisory Committee Member Sun Zhongyao reported that he considered the Executive Committee's implementation of the association's affairs and financial management to be appropriate. Then the chairman submitted various accounting documents for approval, which was passed without objection. Next, Standing Committee Member Jiang Wanping reported on the progress of the National Assembly election matters. The chairman explained the reasons for the initial decision to join the provincial election district. Member Li Wenjie then expressed his opinion, requesting that the association notify all members in writing of the progress of this matter to avoid misunderstandings. Committee Member Wang Yusheng seconded the motion, which was passed and implemented. Next, the cases were discussed: A. The chairman reported that some members were in arrears with their membership fees, some for six months and some for one year. Should they be handled according to the regulations, or should they be notified again? The motion was put to a vote, and it was decided that the association would again notify the members in arrears in writing, giving them three months to pay the fees. Otherwise, they would be removed from membership in accordance with the association's rules. B. Member Bei Zuyi proposed in writing to amend Articles 36 and 39 of the association's rules. It was resolved that: (1) Article 36 of the association's rules would be amended and passed, the amendment being "The members meeting must have a quorum of one-quarter of all members to be held" (2) The provisions of Article 39 regarding representation rights would be amended to limit one member to one right of representation, which was passed. Subsequently, because some of the members present left, there was no quorum, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>United Resistance in the Xin Haishan Case</p>
<p>To Achieve the Goals of Punishing the Murderers, Apologizing, and Compensating for Damages</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, regarding the case of Xin Haishan, an employee of Changhe Seafood Company, being unjustifiably shot and injured by a Western police officer in the French Concession, have submitted a petition to the Municipal Government for negotiation. Although the Municipal Government has consulted with the French Consul and instructed them to severely punish the murderer, and requested compensation and an apology, the French Consul has not yet made a proper response. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday again notified the various public organizations, requesting united resistance. The original letter stated: "Regarding the case of Xin Haishan, an employee of our member Changhe Company, being unjustifiably shot and seriously injured by a Western police officer in the French Concession on the 20th of this month, the industry has submitted a petition to the various agencies to negotiate severely with the French Police. However, there has been no response after several days. Such disregard for human life is truly inhumane. We have always admired your association for advocating justice, so we are submitting a draft telegram and requesting your strong support to uphold justice and achieve the goals of punishing the murderers, apologizing, and compensating for damages. We are extremely grateful, etc." The attached draft telegram was sent to the association. This case was reported by the association, and our association has submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting negotiation of the three articles of the murderer punishment, compensation and guarantee measures. According to the approval, we sent a letter to the French consul on record. From the current situation, in order to unite the strength of the outside world, to reverse the conviction and extend justice, a corresponding letter has been prepared and sent. I hope you will check and take action to the extent of your ability.</p>
<h3>Recent Tragic Reports from Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>More and more wheat seedlings are withering and dying</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu will come with funds for relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster has successively received disaster reports and requests for relief from various counties in Shaanxi, like snowflakes, one after another. The general situation is that spring seedlings are suffering from drought, relief grain is cut off, more people are dying, and more people are fleeing. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from Mr. Cui Junhao (19) of the Xi'an North China Charity Federation (the relief agency established by Zhu Ziqiao), stating that Lou Yuqiao will return to the province on a certain date. The telegram from Xiaoxian was received, stating that 20,000 yuan in relief funds have been collected. The remaining 20,000 yuan will be handed over by Mr. Zhang to Mr. Rao to distribute in Qian County. Relief work in Mei County has been completed, with 11,500 yuan distributed, only one yuan per family. The disaster situation in that area is even worse than the famine relief efforts of last year. The scene is heartbreaking. Of the original 118,000 people, only 63,000 remain. Of those who can survive without relief, there are only 15,000 to 16,000 people. The rest cannot survive without relief. There has been no rain for a long time, and the drought continues. Temporary relief requires 47,000 to 48,000 yuan, so that each person can receive one yuan. The three counties of Qi, Fu, and Xing are under investigation, and tickets are being distributed in advance. Please allocate funds quickly for immediate distribution. According to the recent report from the Whole House Relief Association, over 30,000 people have fled elsewhere, about 50,000 have died, and more than 16,000 women have been sold. The original paddy fields are still viable, but the residents of the upper areas are naked and starving. Recently, there have been consecutive light rains. Attached is a submission from Cui Xianlou. Another telegram (20th) was received from the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association, stating that after investigating the disaster victims in Fengxiang, a total of 96,714 people have committed suicide by jumping into wells, falling off cliffs, or taking poison, as well as those who have starved to death. More than 10,000 people have fled or been sold cheaply. Since the beginning of spring, there have been only two rain showers, which barely wet the ground. Wheat seedlings are withering, and grain prices are rising daily. Furthermore, it is the season between harvests, and more than 200,000 dying lives may not escape starvation. Please provide relief quickly to save the lives of the people, etc. The association is posting advertisements to continue raising funds, and is also urging Mr. Zhu Ziqiao by telegram to go to Shaanxi to plan for distribution as soon as possible. A telegram has been received from Mr. Zhu from Dalian, stating that he will take the Changchun Maru to Shanghai to collect relief funds and personally take them to Shaanxi. It is said that the Changchun Maru is scheduled to arrive on the 26th of this month.</p>

<h3>Ye Zhongfang Rushes Back from Beiping</h3>
<p>Faces Chen Xueli in Court</p>
<p>Ye Zhongfang's Profound Affection</p>
<p>Chen Xueli Lacks Conscience</p>
<p>A Most Embarrassing Flying Kiss</p>
<p>Swallowing Pills, Preparing a Suicide Note</p>
<p>│Judge Hopes for Reconciliation Between the Two Parties│</p>
<p>Chen Xueli, whose original name was Chen Xiuzhen, and who previously worked as a dancer at the Chang'e Dance Hall in the French Concession, is the daughter of the late lawyer Chen Zhigang, and is now nineteen years old. When she worked as a dancer, she met Ye Zhongfang, the grandson of Ye Chengzhong. They were as close as mandarin ducks and butterflies, and their love was extraordinary. Later, with the consent of both parties and with lawyer Jiang Baoli as a witness, they signed a document and rented a house to live together. However, a month ago, due to a breakdown in their relationship, Ye left Shanghai for Beiping, and Chen returned to her mother's home. Initially, Ye's mother and wife sued Chen in court, but at Ye's urging, the lawsuit was withdrawn. Later, Chen's mother, Chen Yan, hired Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun to sue Ye in the Special District Local Court for enticing and abandoning [her daughter]. The Special District Court had already held a preliminary hearing on the afternoon of the 8th of this month, but because the defendant was in Beiping and did not attend, the hearing was adjourned. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the adjourned hearing was held again. The court convened at 2:00 PM, still presided over by Judge Xiao. The plaintiff and defendant both appeared in court to confront each other. As a result, they were ordered to go outside for reconciliation, and the hearing was adjourned again. The details of the hearing are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Plaintiff and Defendant Arrive in Court on Time　This case was originally scheduled for continuation today, but the court, to avoid overcrowding, changed it to yesterday. Therefore, only about a hundred people were in attendance. The plaintiff, Chen Yan, accompanied by her daughter Xiuzhen, arrived at the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court at around 2:00 PM and sat in the witness seat to await instructions. Xiuzhen was wearing a gray coat with white floral trim and a fur collar, flesh-colored stockings, and dark blue satin flat shoes. Ye Zhongfang also rushed back to Shanghai from Beiping a few days ago to prepare for the confrontation. He arrived at the court at around 2:00 PM and sat in the reporter's seat, wearing a suit and appearing relaxed. At 2:30 PM, Judge Xiao Xiefen appeared in court for the hearing. Ye's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Dong Yu, also appeared in court on time to defend him.</p>
<p>Why Not Sue Sooner After Knowing About the Enticement? 　Judge Xiao first asked Ye Zhongfang his age, origin, and address. Ye replied that he was from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, 23 years old, and lived at 601 Jiaozhou Road. He was currently studying. Then, Chen Yan was called to the stand and asked why she was suing Ye Zhongfang. She replied that he had enticed her daughter Xiuzhen to run away. She was asked how old her daughter was. She replied that she was 19 years old this year. She was asked if her daughter was betrothed to anyone. She replied no. She was asked when she was enticed away. She replied that it was when she was 17 years old, that is, December 22nd of the year before last. She was asked where. She replied that at that time, she had returned to her hometown for her husband's funeral on the 22nd, and she had agreed with her daughter to return together. The defendant took the opportunity to come and coax her daughter to go out for refreshments, and she never returned home. She was asked when she returned. She replied that it was around May of last year. She was asked if she had searched for her. She replied that she had searched and had reported it to the French police. She was asked if she had placed an advertisement in the newspaper. She replied no. She was asked if she had asked her daughter where she had been after she returned. She replied that her daughter said she was at Ye Zhongfang's place. She was asked how they got together. She replied that she only knew that Ye had taken her away and didn't know what had happened. She was asked if her daughter had gone out again after she returned. She replied yes. She was asked since her daughter returned in May of last year and she knew that she had been enticed away by Ye Zhongfang, why she had only come to sue now. She replied that she hadn't sued before because she had many children and lacked the strength. Now, because Ye's mother and wife were suing her in court, she was also suing him. She was asked if she would not have sued if Ye Zhongfang hadn't sued her. She replied that if she had the strength, she would have sued anyway. She was asked if her daughter was Ye Zhongfang's concubine. She replied that she didn't know.</p>
<p>Leaving His Wife to Marry Me 　Judge Xiao then called Chen Xiuzhen to the stand and asked her how old she was. She replied that she was 19 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at 19 Qingshun Lane, Rue Ste. Marie. She was asked what her occupation was. She replied that she had no occupation now. She was asked who Chen Yan was. She replied that she was her birth mother. She was asked if it was true that she was enticed away by Ye on December 22nd of the year before last, as her mother had said. She replied that it was. She was asked how she was enticed away. She replied that he asked her to go for refreshments. After the refreshments, he took her to the train station. However, he first took her to the Xin Xin Hotel to open a room, and then rented a house at 45 Mingde Lane. She was asked if her mother knew. She replied no. She was asked if he had taken her for refreshments. She replied yes. At that time, he didn't allow her to go home, saying that he wanted to marry her. She was asked if she was willing. She replied that he said he would divorce his wife, so she was willing. But her mother didn't know. She was asked if she had lived with his wife after going to Ye's house. She replied yes. She was asked if she was his concubine. She replied that she didn't know at first, but later she found out when she saw that he had children, but it was too late to do anything.</p>
<p>It's Okay to Be a Concubine If Life is Good 　She was asked if they had signed a contract. She replied that they had signed it at lawyer Jiang Baoli's office. She was called there by Ye, and she had brought a copy with her (which was presented to the court by her lawyer, Xue Jiaqi). She was asked if her mother knew. She replied no. She was asked when she told her mother. She replied that it was about May or June, when she went to visit her mother because she was ill, that she told her mother. She was asked when she went back after running away on December 22nd. She replied that she went back after about five or six months. She was asked if she had told her mother about this after she went back. She replied that she had told her. She was asked what her mother had said at the time. She replied that her mother said it would be okay as long as life was good.</p>
<p>Being a Concubine Doesn't Necessarily Mean Money 　She was asked if she had received any money. She replied no. She was asked why she hadn't received any money. The contract stated that she was a concubine and that if she was abandoned in the future, she would receive 20,000 yuan. She replied that being a concubine didn't necessarily mean money. She was asked if she could be independent if she was someone's concubine. She replied that she didn't tell her mother because she had been with him for five or six months before she came back.</p>
<p>Chen's Mother Allowed Her to Live with Her Daughter　Judge Xiao then turned to Ye Zhongfang and asked if he had any response to what the Chen women had said. Ye replied that he certainly had his own defense, saying that according to the other party, he went to Chen's house and took Xiuzhen out, so why wouldn't Chen's mother have sued at that time? He met Xiuzhen at the dance hall and danced with her, and they got along very well. He had bought many things for her and her mother. One day, he was drunk, and her mother told him to sleep at her house and told her daughter to stay with him. That night, they had relations. After that, they often stayed outside. Because they were shy, her mother advised him not to spend so much money outside and to live in a house at her house. He bought a lot of furniture, wallpapered the walls, and installed electric lights. They lived at her house for about two or three months. This could all be proven. He also agreed to give her ten yuan every day. Later, because he didn't have the money to provide, her mother was unhappy, and he couldn't bear it, so he stopped going. Later, Xueli tried to commit suicide by swallowing opium because her mother was pressuring her. She was cured by Dr. Sun Kejin's injection. Later, Xiuzhen repeatedly invited him by phone to meet her at the Carlton. After he met her, he knew that she and her mother could no longer get along. She asked him to rent a house. Before renting the house, they first stayed at Room 11 of the Xin Xin Hotel. At this time, she asked lawyer Zhang Ding to write a letter and publish a statement that she was breaking away from her mother. Later, they moved to 45 Mingde Lane. At the same time, they signed a contract. Her younger siblings came to Mingde Lane and went out to play with them. Later, due to lack of money, they moved to the old house on Jiaozhou Road. At the old house, she and her mother didn't get along, and his mother helped to mediate. What he said was all true, and there was no falsehood.</p>
<p>Her Conscience Isn't Bad, She Treats Me Very Well 　After Ye finished his statement, Judge Xiao asked when he started living with Xiuzhen. He replied that it was in May of the year before last, when Xiuzhen was working as a dancer at the Chang'e Dance Hall. He was asked if he took Xiuzhen out on December 22nd. He replied that she asked him to the Carlton Theater to discuss it with him because Xiuxiu Zhen wanted to leave and didn't want to go home. He was asked if her mother had returned to her hometown at that time. He replied that he didn't know. He was asked when Xiuzhen came to his house. He replied that it was after August of last year. At that time, her conscience wasn't bad and she treated him very well. And because the expenses were too high, they returned to the old house. Before that, they lived on the third floor of 45 Mingde Lane for about five or six months. He was asked if her mother knew. He replied that she certainly knew. He and Xiuzhen went out to play every day, and everyone knew. Even her younger siblings were often together. He was asked if her mother agreed to him living with Xiuzhen. He replied that if her mother didn't know when they signed the contract, she could sue. At this time, lawyer Jiang Yiping asked the court to ask Chen Yan if the defendant had lived in her house for three months, so she knew that she had agreed.</p>
<p>Knowing in Advance, Acknowledging Afterwards　Lawyer Jiang also said that the electric lights and wallpaper in Chen's house were all installed by the defendant, which proved that Chen Yan knew in advance and acknowledged it afterwards. Ye Zhongfang's cohabitation with Chen Xiuzhen did not break away from the person enjoying parental rights, so how could it be called enticement? Lawyer Xue Jiaqi also stated that the only thing that needed to be studied was whether Chen Yan knew about Xiuzhen's departure. There was an advertisement published by lawyer Zhang Ding on behalf of Chen Yan searching for her, which could prove it. He then presented the newspaper to the court. Judge Xiao then asked Chen Yan if the defendant had lived in her house for three months, as the defendant claimed. She replied that he had, but the defendant had come to rent the remaining rooms, and he had come with several friends, saying that he wanted to divorce his wife. She was asked if it was possible for one person to rent two houses to live in. She replied that the defendant had never come to live there. She was asked if Ye Zhongfang and Xiuzhen had a relationship at that time. She replied that she didn't know. She was asked if she had any evidence that Ye Zhongfang had enticed her daughter away. She replied that it was when Ye came and called her away, and he had taken away all the electric lights. She also didn't know that they were living together in Mingde Lane. She was asked if she had seen the newspaper her daughter published on January 24th of last year. She replied that she had seen it, and she had asked lawyer Chen Jinrong to write a letter to ask about it. She was asked why she had waited until October to write the letter when her daughter published the newspaper in January. She replied that it was because she was ill and was afraid that there would be letters before that. She was asked if she went to ask Xiuzhen to come back, and if she had come back. She replied that Ye didn't dare let her come back. She was asked if she didn't object to her daughter signing a contract with Ye to be his concubine. She replied that at first, it was said that they were getting married, but later she found out that she was a concubine.</p>
<p>How Could You Forget About Cohabitation?　At this time, the plaintiff's lawyer, Wang, asked Ye Zhongfang when he had rented the house in Mingde Lane. He replied that it was the year before last. He was asked what month. He replied that he had forgotten. He was asked when he had terminated the lease. He replied that he had forgotten. He was asked if he had also forgotten that he had lived with Xiuzhen. He replied that they had lived together for four or five months, and this was the most memorable thing, so how could he forget?</p>
<p>Chen Yan Refuses to Answer the Judge 　After lawyer Wang finished asking questions, Ye's lawyer, Dong Yu, also stood up and asked for the court's permission to question Chen Yan. He asked how many years her daughter had studied, but she refused to answer. He asked her again and again, but she not only didn't answer, but said that the judge could ask, but he couldn't ask her. Lawyer Jiang then stood up and declared that Chen Yan was refusing to answer the judge and should be noted by the court. Judge Xiao then told her that the lawyer could ask her and she should answer what she knew. Lawyer Xue also advised her to answer, so she replied that she had studied, but she had forgotten how many years. Lawyer Dong then asked if she had asked Zhu Xinying to go to Ye's house to ask for 20,000 yuan. She replied that he could go ask Ms. Zhu. She was asked if she had received fifty yuan from him. She replied that he had sent it to her. She was asked if Ye had been to her house. She replied that it was because her daughter had been beaten by Ye, so his mother had sent it to her. Lawyer Jiang then asked Chen Yan if Ye Zhongfang had rented a house at her house. She replied that he had, it was a small house that he rented.</p>
<p>Adjourn the Hearing and Reconcile Outside the Court　At this point, Judge Xiao then turned to Chen Xiuzhen and asked why she had filed a lawsuit when she had been with Ye Zhongfang for two years. (She replied) My mother wanted to sue him, not me. (He asked) Your mother knew about it before, so why does she still want to sue him now? (She replied) My mother has already said the reason why my mother wanted to sue him, I don't need to say it again. After Judge Xiao heard the case, he announced to the lawyers of both parties that the plaintiff and defendant had been together for two years, so why did they go to court? It would be better to go outside and try to reconcile. Lawyer Jiang Yiping then stood up and stated that he was willing to accept the court's ruling and try his best to reconcile, while the plaintiff's lawyer requested that the defendant be detained or released on bail because the defendant had not arrived last time. Judge Xiao said that the defendant was a person with property and did not need to be detained or released on bail, and ordered that the case be adjourned for two weeks to try to reconcile, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>Zhongfang Blows a Kiss, Xiuzhen is Ashamed　After the court was adjourned, Chen Xiuzhen was surrounded by photographers when she left the court with her mother. However, Chen's mother expressed her unwillingness and quickly hid beside her uncle, Mr. Yan, lowered her head and left the court, walking north. Ye Zhongfang was also waiting for Xiuzhen in front of the court. When Xiuzhen left the court, Ye shouted "Madam," but Xiuzhen didn't look back. It was a coincidence that Xiuzhen and her mother walked north to Haining Road to take a rickshaw, and then traveled east on Qipu Road, while Ye Zhongfang and Jiang Yiping happened to be getting into a car at the back door of Qipu Road when they suddenly saw the Chen women coming towards them. Ye immediately shouted "Xueli Madam" and put his hand to his mouth, making a kissing gesture. The Chen women made a gesture of shame with their fingers. Ye also shouted "Xueli, you should have some conscience!" Xueli replied, "Are you still talking about conscience with you now?"</p>
<p>Swallowing Pills, Preparing a Suicide Note　Before arriving in court, Ye Zhongfang had taken ten sleeping pills and prepared several suicide notes to his mother, relatives, friends, and newspaper reporters, preparing to commit suicide. He was only prevented from committing suicide after being monitored and persuaded by relatives and friends. A copy of his self-statement is recorded below. "I will go to a place where I don't want to see Xue, to avoid the humiliation of being detained. A couple who were deeply in love have come to this end today. Although it can be said that Zhong is responsible for his own misfortune, Xue is too heartless. Looking back on the past, I can't help but feel moved. Zhong abandoned his family and changed his name to join the military academy, just to seek death. But who can know why I died? Therefore, I decided to skip school and arrive in court on time, enduring the pain to express my bitter heart, so that people in society can fully understand and dispel the previous misunderstandings about this case. Zhong sacrificed everything for Xue. Everything Zhong shouldn't have done, he did for the sake of loving Xue. Disobeying my mother is the first thing, abandoning my family is the second, spending lavishly is the third, and other minor faults are hard to list. Zhong was abandoned after sacrificing everything, and today Xue hates Zhong like a worn shoe. She even colluded with her mother to criminally accuse Zhong, breaking Zhong's heart and ruining Zhong's reputation. If Xue still has a heart, she should ask herself in the quiet of night if she feels that this method is too harsh. At the hearing on the 8th, Zhong did not attend because his leave was not approved. Xue's mother's lawyer then said that Zhong was absent because he was afraid of being punished. It should be known that everything Xue's mother said in her complaint was a paper tiger that would be punctured with a little poke. After Zhong met Xue, he not only went in and out of her house day and night, but also lived with Xue in the drawing-room of her house for about three months at her command. Wallpapering and buying wooden furniture, installing electric lights, everything was done arbitrarily without her permission. And when Xue was at the Chang'e, she had a big fight with her girlfriend for dancing with Zhong, and she also came to the scene to dissuade her. The facts are all there and can be proved, and cannot be falsely accused. Before Xue lived with Zhong, she asked lawyer Zhang Ding to negotiate with her mother on her behalf, and stated that if Zhong seduced her, then lawyer Zhang should be questioned first. Later, my mother tried to reconcile with her mother at the Atlantic Restaurant because Xue had no home to go to. This can also be investigated. And Xue broke away from her family after fighting with her mother, and after living with Zhong, they also signed a contract at lawyer Jiang's office with the consent of both parties. But today, she came to court with her mother to participate in the prosecution, without saying that Zhong still loves her like the flesh of his heart. Even if Zhong is truly unfaithful and abandons her, she can file a lawsuit on her own according to the contract. But today, Xue is not doing this. Instead, she is reversing her previous approach to cooperation, working with her mother to fabricate words and put Zhong in trouble. She must have other thoughts in her heart, intending to falsely accuse him. Therefore, this case is not so much a love lawsuit as a black-hearted lawsuit. Things have come to this point, and Zhong's heart is as bitter as eating huanglian, and no one knows it. Only Xue is the love of my life. Although she has left me, my love for her has not diminished. I also hope that she can marry a satisfactory man and grow old together, and no longer have conscious love affairs. Don't fail my one and a half years of careful protection, don't fall, don't be deceived, take the path of light and enter the door of happiness. I will die with my eyes closed. Zhong also has no face to ask for the family's pity, and no face to ask friends for help to salvage this broken situation. I made my own mistakes, I suffer my own hardships, and life is worse than death."</p>
<h3>Gold Bars Hidden Inside Turtle Shells</h3>
<p>Smugglers Have Ingenious Ideas</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Discovered by Customs Officers</p>
<p>The "Chinese-language Newspaper" reports that yesterday (the 21st), when the Nagasaki Maru was leaving the port, customs officers found ten gold bars being smuggled out hidden inside turtle shells. When the customs officers boarded the ship for inspection, they caught sight of six baskets of turtles, which made them suspicious. They also noticed that there were several dead turtles at the bottom of the baskets, which made them even more suspicious. They took out the live ones and examined the dead ones, and found gold bars hidden inside the shells. The smugglers had hollowed out the internal organs of the four turtles and inserted the gold bars inside. At first glance, there was nothing unusual, and they thought it was a perfect plan, but they didn't expect that their inability to move would arouse the suspicion of the customs officers. Since the National Government strictly prohibited the export of gold, smugglers have emerged one after another. A few days ago, someone tried to smuggle gold bars in eel baskets, but they were also detected by customs officers and confiscated. It is also reported that customs officers seized 175 pounds of opium on another ship on Monday.</p>
<h3>Special Court Guard</h3>
<p>Steals Firearms from the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Secretly Discovered by Lu Ying</p>
<p>The Guard is Detained Awaiting Legal Action</p>
<p>The guards in the Special District Local Court were transferred from the Municipal Public Security Bureau when the court was established and were responsible for protection. One of the guards, named Meng Xiushan, was from Hebei Province. After each shift, he often returned to the Public Security Bureau to visit his old brothers. Recently, he took the opportunity to steal five Mauser pistols and more than 300 rounds of ammunition from the bureau, secretly took them to the Special Court, and hid them in a box in the guard's bedroom in the flat house on the left side of the Special Court's main entrance. No one knew about it at first. It was not until about 3:00 AM on the night of the 19th of this month that the bureau discovered the missing firearms. The investigation team leader, Lu Ying, secretly investigated and learned that Meng had stolen them. The next morning, Captain Lu went to the Special Court and asked the prosecutor's office to transfer the guard for investigation. Chief Prosecutor Zhou approved the request. Later, Captain Lu took Meng Xiushan back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation. Meng could not deny it and confessed, and also revealed where he had hidden the firearms. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Captain Lu returned to the Special Court and found the guns and ammunition, all intact, in the box in the guard's bedroom. He immediately took them back to the bureau and reported them to Director Chen of the Public Security Bureau for instructions on how to handle the matter according to the law.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bank Building Completed</h3>
<p>Office and Apartment Rental Section to Open Next Month</p>
<p>Recently, construction projects have flourished in Shanghai, and the construction of office and apartment buildings for rent has also increased rapidly. The new Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank building has now been completed, standing majestically on Ningbo Road. The structure of the bank's headquarters is particularly bright and magnificent. The interior of the building includes office and apartment rentals, bordering Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, making it a leader among Chinese-owned buildings. It is said that the office space has already been fully rented, with only a few apartments remaining. The apartment system originated in Western countries. Affluent families rent apartments, enjoying the convenience of modern facilities such as elevators, hot and cold water, steam, and refrigerators, suitable for both winter and summer. This allows the owner and hostess to adapt to the seasons with ease, without the need for servants. Moreover, this facility is similar to a cooperative operation by the tenants, which is in line with the principles of consumer cooperation. The apartments in the Shanghai Bank all have these features. The apartment building is only a hundred yards from the Bund, providing ample convenience for leisure and comfort. Those who have already rented will start renting next month, along with the office space.</p>

<h3>Passengers Must Have Air Pillows</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Mr. Liu Changrong of the Anhui Sanhe Weighing Station: "Dear Sir, I recently read in your newspaper that many large ships along the Yangtze River and the coast have had accidents, causing many passenger injuries and deaths, which is distressing to hear. Here is a method to ensure safety when traveling by boat, which is the rubber cloth air pillow sold in foreign goods stores. It can be used as a pillow at ordinary times. Take it with you when traveling by boat. In case of danger, you can hold the pillow in your arms, and even if you fall into the water, you will not drown. The method is to first weave a mesh cover with a thicker cotton rope or thread, put the pillow into the mesh, and tie the four corners with larger rope loops, which will be strong and durable. Grasp firmly with both hands in case of danger to ensure safety. I am not an advertising representative for the pillow industry. I am writing this out of concern for the pain of death in domestic travel, and I implore the chief editor to publish it in your newspaper to protect people's lives."</p>

<p>Convicted of Resisting Orders</p>
<p>Qian Jintang Fined 800 Yuan</p>
<p>Cao Shanzhi Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>After the Tiannan Hotel on Aiduya Road was sued by a creditor, the Special District Local Court approved a preliminary attachment. On the 16th of this month, when the bailiff and police officers were sent to seal the hotel, the hotel manager Qian Jintang and tea house worker Cao Shanzhi came forward to obstruct them. The police officers reported this to the police station, who dispatched detectives to arrest Qian and Cao and take them to the Special District Local Court for interrogation, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu ordered the two defendants to be brought before the court for questioning, and immediately sentenced them. Qian Jintang was sentenced to a fine of 800 yuan for inciting others to resist legal orders. If the fine is not paid, it will be converted to imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day, but not exceeding one year.

<h3>The Truth About the Zhongzhou Hotel Suicide</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was a Chauffeur</p>
<p>Committed Suicide Due to Excessive Debt</p>
<p>A man and a woman came to the Zhongzhou Hotel in Maijiaquan the other day and stayed in room 107. They committed suicide by poisoning. When they were discovered, the man was beyond救药 and died, and the woman was still barely breathing and was sent to the hospital for treatment, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the deceased was Zhang Jingtao, also known as Zhang Er. The woman was Zhang's mistress. Zhang was a chauffeur for Mr. Xie, an official at the Jianghai Customs. Although his monthly income was not low, his expenses were very high, and he was already in financial straits. Three months ago, he returned to his hometown in Yangzhou to marry a woman named Dong, which cost a lot of money. Most of the money was borrowed from Indians, totaling no less than a thousand yuan. After marrying Dong, he brought her to Shanghai, intending to live with his mistress to save household expenses, but Dong strongly opposed it, so his austerity policy could not be implemented. Recently, the debts he had incurred were gradually coming due, and he was unable to repay them, so he was sued by the creditors. Ten days ago, Zhang planned to abandon his career as a driver and take Dong away from Shanghai, but she stopped him. So, he left home alone last Thursday and never returned. Dong did not know where he had gone and searched everywhere. Unexpectedly, he had gone to a hotel with his mistress and committed suicide by drinking poison. Dong has an older brother who is a police officer in the General Police Station, number 2459. When he heard about the suicide, he went to the mortuary on Feilun Road to identify the body. He saw that it was his sister, so he rushed to notify her sister at 376 Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, to prepare clothes and a coffin. Yesterday morning, after Guo, the prosecutor of the Special District Local Court, came to the mortuary to examine the body clearly, Dong and her brother filed a case and requested to claim the body for burial.</p>

After entering the hospital, the young man helped the injured man into the examination room to wait for treatment. The young man pretended to go out to pay the rickshaw fare, but did not return for a long time. The people in the hospital were very surprised and reported to the police station, who ordered Chinese and Western detectives to come and search, but they could not find him. The injured man had broken his tibias in both legs. When he arrived at the hospital, he was already unconscious and bleeding from his mouth and nose. Resuscitation was ineffective, and he died at around 1:00 p.m. He was wearing a blue-gray cloth padded jacket, a blue cloth short shirt, and black cloth padded pants, looking like a worker.</p>

<h3>Dasin Silk and Satin Store Business is Booming</h3>
<p>The Dasin Silk and Satin Store at the intersection of Shilu and Sanma Road is known as the only large-scale, modern silk and satin store in Shanghai that is trusted by the public for its genuine goods at fair prices. The store will hold a 21-day spring sale starting on the 22nd of this month. Yesterday was the first day of the sale. From morning to night, customers were extremely crowded.

It is now heard that the silk and satin industry, in order to maintain the relationship, has sent a letter to the refining industry, asking them to continue trading and suggesting that both parties send representatives to hold a joint meeting, and invite the competent authorities to attend the meeting to jointly find a proper solution. It is hoped that after this meeting, all the difficulties between the two industries can be resolved.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Chief Editor,</p>
<p>I have read in your newspaper's local news column that a guest shop owner was accused of bigamy and abandonment. The protagonist, Sun Runyu, was mistakenly identified by your newspaper as the owner of Yuxing Pawnshop. The colleagues in our pawnshop were very surprised to read this. Our pawnshop was founded solely by Sun Runshen, without any external shareholders. The Sun Runyu mentioned in your newspaper has nothing to do with our pawnshop. The involvement of the owner of Yuxing Pawnshop is probably due to inaccurate rumors. We are deeply afraid that the outside world will confuse right and wrong and spread rumors, so we have written to you to request a correction. Sincerely, The Colleagues of Yuxing Pawnshop.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>When the Dalun Real Estate case was heard in court yesterday, the arguments made by our lawyer on behalf of the tenants regarding jurisdiction were slightly different from those reported in today's newspaper. Here is a summary for your kind correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Youling.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court believes that the case involves a dispute over the lease, not just a dispute over eviction, so Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law cannot be applied as primary jurisdiction, but Article 11 of the same law should be used to determine jurisdiction. Both the Civil Procedure Law and the Civil Procedure Regulations have provisions for agreed jurisdiction. Therefore, a case that is originally a primary jurisdiction case can be subject to local jurisdiction by agreement of the parties, and a case that is originally a local jurisdiction case can be subject to primary jurisdiction by agreement of the parties. In the first instance of this case, Dalun Company clearly argued according to the primary jurisdiction case, and the court clearly accepted the case according to the primary jurisdiction case, and the tenants did not raise any objection to the lack of jurisdiction before the debate. According to Article 40 of the Civil Procedure Law and Article 40, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, it has become an agreed primary jurisdiction case without any doubt. The Supreme Court ignored this situation and believed that the case should be accepted by the same court for the third instance, which is a factual error, not an error in legal opinion. After the establishment of the High Branch Court, the court submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan for an interpretation of where the third instance of the primary jurisdiction case accepted by the former High Court of Appeal should be accepted. The Judicial Yuan's Directive No. 160 instructed that the primary jurisdiction cases of the former Temporary Court should be the High Branch Court as the court of third instance (i.e., the court of final instance) has become a precedent. The appeal in this case was filed after the establishment of the High Branch Court. According to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law and the Civil Procedure Regulations on agreed jurisdiction, the Judicial Yuan's Directive No. 160 is not to be accepted by the Supreme Court. Now that it is a judgment of the third instance, it is what the Civil Procedure Law calls the judgment court not following the legal system. An appeal for retrial can be filed against a judgment court that does not follow the legal system. However, this case has been remanded for retrial, which is different from a completely final case. It is doubtful whether a retrial can be filed because the jurisdictional part has already been determined. However, a retrial can only be filed after it is completely determined, then all procedures will be carried out in vain, which will cause many obstacles in fact. How should it be remedied? The Judicial Yuan should be asked for instructions. It should be solemnly declared that the jurisdictional issue raised by this lawyer is based on the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law and the Civil Procedure Regulations on agreed jurisdiction, and the Judicial Yuan's Directive No. 160 that the primary cases of the former Temporary Court should be accepted by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for the third instance. Therefore, it has nothing to do with the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law and Article 11 of the same law. Therefore, it has no conflict with the Supreme Court's opinion.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item in your newspaper's local news column entitled "Lu Lixia's Regret for a Misstep." The excerpt from the indictment stated, "Lu Lixia intended to apply for a position as a female employee at the Shanghai Guohuo Bank. Unexpectedly, the defendant, Lan Wenlin, a colleague at the bank, took a liking to her at first sight and repeatedly tried to seduce her." Our bank has never recruited female employees, and there is no such person as Lu Lixia or Lan Wenlin among our employees. Please correct this on our behalf. Sincerely, Shanghai Guohuo Bank, April 22.</p>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of the Shanghai Shenbao,</p>
<p>I have read a report in your newspaper of the 19th (reporting date) entitled "Resolution of the Dispute between Old and New Workers on the Gonghe Wheel." This is not in accordance with the facts. (1) The Seamen's Union did not send representatives. (2) The old workers and the comprador both expressed their objections to the Wuhan Municipal Government's intention to retain the new workers. (3) The old workers only signed in at the arbitration meeting for the case and did not sign off on any solutions. Please investigate and correct this. Sincerely, The Organizing Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint Federation, Ma Yin.</p>

<h3>Oil Painting and New Green</h3>
<p>— Written by Yamamoto Kanae, Translated by Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>For me, using oil painting to sketch landscapes, the color green is the most difficult to express. When it comes to… fields and hills, they all become a heavy, solid green. River beaches and such shine like lead roofs. Tree trunks, appearing with a grape-like color in the height of summer, are not easy to start with. Although I am deeply moved by that kind of weighty, masculine "nature," once I try to depict it, the result is just an ordinary depiction. …This is because there is no embellishment in the summer scenery. …Although plants contain an ample quantity (Volume) and present a magnificent beauty, the changes in color and shade cannot compare to spring and autumn. This is consistent with winter, so I would rather draw "sketches" in summer and winter.</p>
<p>When it comes to new green, I feel that oil painting is the best way to express it. …Isn't that kind of bright, intense color just like the colors freshly squeezed from a paint tube: Cadmium Citron, Cadmium Cair, Vert Emeraude, and so on? …For example, the tender leaves of the persimmon tree are a color with a little "Cadmium Citron" mixed into "Vert Emeraude." …The new green of the Kaname tree (tree name) is a color with a little Carance "red" mixed into "Cadmium Cair." The new sprouts of the oak tree are a color with Indian Yellow added to "Cadmium Citron" to make it slightly dim and obscure, and then a touch of "blue." …The new green of the larch is a bit like scallions. It is better to use blue than green; it is still a color blended with "Cadmium Citron" and those colors. Generally speaking, these can all be used directly from the colors on the "palette" without error… Green—and new green—is as bright as a flower. …During the season of new green, the soil also appears with a loveliness that one cannot help but feel. …It seems as soft as butter, as loose as cake, and as heavy as beef, and it is moist even in the daytime. …This color is really a color that can tempt the desire for oil painting. …The soil is good, of course, but the sky at that time is also beautiful. Mostly, it is cloudy with a tinge of water color, making the new green of the oak and camphor trees appear as bright as frost. That sky is also something that belongs to oil painting.</p>
<p>However, oil paintings depicting new green are rarely seen in recent exhibitions. In the past, there were probably various paintings of new green, but there doesn't seem to be any work that has become a well-regarded one. …I remember clearly that the year before last, in the Western masterpieces exhibited by the Asahi Shimbun, there was a large work by Monet depicting the new green of hazel trees. …It still used his elastic brushstrokes to thickly pile up bright paints to express the fresh midday sunlight. …This painting can be considered one of the representative works in Monet's production. —Generally speaking, in the paintings of the early Impressionists, "green paintings" are quite common. Sisley, for example, also painted many new greens of poplars and sycamores. …Pissarro excelled at green orchards. …And Renoir's olive groves and Cezanne's pine trees… Thinking of them one by one, there seem to be quite a few. Sisley, when expressing the bright green color of the shade, has a habit of embellishing it with grape color, which, I feel, makes the painting vulgar and inelegant. …On the deep green of the olive trees painted by Renoir, there is a mixture of Emeraude, Carance, Bleu (blue), and so on, making it as smooth as deep nephrite. —Cezanne seems to not use Emerald; any bright color seems to be made with "yellow" and "blue." Moreover, in the shaded parts, there is almost no trace of "red." …He probably uses his soft brush, dipped in a thick amount of paint. …The brush is not picky, does not slide, but is quiet and never diminishes. …He certainly dwells on the symphony of colors of the Motive (the subject of the painting, i.e., the scene being depicted—translator's note) in his eyes and depicts it. …That painting of green trees is truly beautiful.</p>
<p>When it comes to Japanese works, in my past memory, there are the watercolor paintings of Miyake Kokki. When Mr. Miyake first returned from abroad, he frequently painted many green paintings. I remember that before I was an art student, everyone at that time was fascinated by Mr. Miyake's "green paintings." Ishii Hakutei's watercolor painting, titled "Tender Persimmon Tree," was also well-received. …Yamashita Shintaro also publishes his beautiful green forests every year. …As for recently, in the previous Shun'yokai exhibition, Umehara Ryuzaburo exhibited a work with a large group of green trees and shadows as the foreground "Lake Haruna," which made me recall the clear charm of the green mountains.</p>
