<h3>劉榮泰君之死後生前</h3>
<p>劉恨我自蚌埠寄</p>
<p>閘北三段救火會隊長劉榮泰君。報載於本月九夜十時許。聞火警赴援。</p>
<p>因公殞命。恨我素稔劉君聞耗震痛。邇方佐政皖北。遠覊千里因摭記舊事。藉資憑弔。</p>
<p>憶識劉君時在民十六盛夏而締交經過。更屬奇艶。緣恨我年少放蕩。寄情風月。偶戀一飄泊女郎曰金玉五孃。不圖亦爲劉君舊識。傳聞所及。遽割愛相讓。旋以瘦腰郎之介。一見如故。竟成知交。偶話往事。相顧啞然。今劉君已歸道山。痛失良友。金玉薄命飄零。消息迷離恨我亦歷刧歡場。綺念早息。回首前產恍同一夢。</p>
<p>劉君生性和藹從無疾言厲色以是新知舊雨。樂與交游。時方歲莫朋儕紛集。關一室於新新客舍作小息嬉游之所。劉君適任公共租界老閘捕房特別探員。朝夕過從。遊宴與共偶話生平。一傾積　。深以此生涯易招怨尤。終非所願恨我方</p>

<h3>楊小樓到滬訪問記</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>楊小樓新豔秋等。於十四日下午到滬余聞訊。亟訪小樓於大中華飯店。　　小樓風采如舊。惟兩頰稍現風塵之色不慣長途跋涉者。宜其有此勞頓也。小樓見余。握手相迎。寒暄既畢。絮絮爲余道別後狀况。談及領子克明大逆一事。眉宇間頓現不豫之態。余恐其過於傷懐。亟以他語亂之。小樓之言曰。自前歲除夕前在平別後。即抱采就之憂。臥床三月。始告痊愈。此三月中。日與藥爐茶竈爲伴。精神上至感痛苦。幸託天之佑。三月後即漸慚脫體。然經此一病。身體已不如以前之結實矣。至下半年逆子克明。不安本分。屢屢肇事。實予我以種種之難堪。今春又多疾病。忽病忽愈。殊感不快。夏季北平酷暑爲從來所無。乃假進香爲名。避暑於蓮花山秋凉始返平。經此長時間之休養。賤軀始獲復原。興之所至。出演於平津兩處。亦復彌覺清健。此次來滬。余本人本無此意。經大舞臺之誠意邀請。復由諸親友之熱烈慫恿。乃有今日之一行。然余自甲戌北歸以後。迄今已有十載。滬上故舊俱已生疏。此次重來。對於諸老友或不免有慢忽不周之處。是則望諸老友之加以諒解寬恕者也。倘蒙不棄　菲。時予指敎。匡我不逮。則我之受賜多矣。</p>
<p>與小樓同來者。有傳小山劉硯亭劉芳諸人。楊之眷屬及其外甥劉宗楊。亦均同來。宗楊係硯芳之子。唱武老生。一以小樓爲法。十一歲時已享盛名。在平素有小妖怪之目。此次南來。全係游玩性質。並不登臺。</p>
<p>新豔秋亦住大中華。與小樓同車到滬。到後即赴大報館訪其義父林屋山人。人稱其孝。馬連良並未返平。日前盛傳其北歸邀角者誤也。</p>
<p>楊等寓所。大中華係暫時性質。俟梅畹華譚富英等離滬。楊等即須搬入巨籟達路新宅。梅譚北歸之期。大概不出二十二日前後云。</p>
<h3>安吉吳先生墓表</h3>

<p>先生禕俊卿。字昌碩。晚以字行。安吉吳氏。世居縣西鄣吳邨。明宏治中析置孝豐縣。邨隸孝豐。籍仍其舊。潛德懋學。嬗聞家牒。粵寇之難。鄣吳舉邨被屠。祖母嚴。母萬。聘妻楊。乃弟妹。並就夷殲。吳氏不絕。裁比縣髮。先生奉父流轉。飢餓窮谷。幸脫於死。亂定。成諸生。追惟家難。趨若在疚。紛華之念。消沮幾盡。偃蹇中歲。貧不自周。不得已試吏江蘇。叙勞累轉至直隸州知州。守宰安東。一月謝去。捐勢削迹。自此遠矣。夙躭文藝。兼擅治印。盤孟鼎碣。沈浸追琢。恢恢游刄。冥合秦漢。孤文小石。　者矜異。等於璆璧。先生之書。人方出員。肅若栗若。籀篆隸草。靡不賅贍。先生之畫。渾噩諔　。獨闢隅奧。千紾萬變。無跡可躡。旣反初服。徘回吳越間。齎金求索。踵趾逪集。森然起例。義取無忸。親戚義故。推贍提肘。七十而後。光名彌著。東瀛橋士。欽其才品。爲冶金船象龕。置西湖孤山之麓。過其下者。流連嗟慕。增成故實。先生器情寬博。不有其。深執謙退。與物無罪。自更國變。逡遁辟地。惟與流人野老春容瞭接。時政升降。略不掛口。屬病重聽。樂於自晦。雖賓坐周旋。小乖應對。而意色冲然。莫測所蘊。生平感慨。一抒於詩。幽搜孤造。深入其阻。晚年屬思益勞。片辭涵揉。恒至申旦。家人微止之。即曰。非鬱胡串。非茹胡吐。吾自渫所不甘。何云苦也。春秋八十有四。丁卯十一月六日告终上海寓邸。哀問乍布。遐邇悼歎。及門弟子。咨度典則。相與著謚曰貞逸先生。含章抱節。騫然遐轝。彰德旌行。不亦審乎。所箸詩歌序跋。綜爲缶廬詩十□卷。外集□卷。曾祖芳南。國子監生。祖淵舉人。海鹽教諭。父辛甲。舉人截取知縣。配施恭人。簡靖率素。有高世之志。金石證曏。同心黽勉。式好偕　。華首不渝。先十年卒。男子子三。曰育。殤。曰涵。出後從父。曰邁。女子子一。歸烏程邱培函。先生卒前數月。嘗游唐棲超山。茲地有唐玉潛之遺風。巖棲谷汲。民物隱秀。先生樂其高勝。夷猶林阜。憺焉忘反。邁敬承先旨。謀茲靈宅。旋得吉卜。兆域斯定。粵以辛未之冬。下窆封隧。永寗體魄。是用甄述景行。鐫石塋表。上質有昊。下誶無紀。慈谿馮開表。</p>
<h3>長生術</h3>
<p>— 李寒吻</p>
<p>人生之壽命。最高者可至百歲。然已不能多見。蓋人生於世。其所處之境遇。及其他一切之事。有損害身體者。因之壽命於無形中减少。不佞硏究多時。對於下列各條。特別注意。覺身體較前强健多矣。因不敢自秘。錄投本報。以供吾國人之參考。</p>
<p>無論男女。每日必需飲沸水數杯。以清腸胃。起身及睡眠。必須按時。不可或早或遲。飲食宜有定數。不可過量。亦不可過少。每日按時大便一次。工作後稍稍運動。勞逸必須相等。烟酒等物。必不可進。進之極傷身。勿喜過甚。勿欣憂愁過度。勿全夜不眠。</p>
<p>住房必需佈置雅潔。勿趨繁華。窗洞宜多。雖在冬季。亦不可嚴閉。烘火更宜開窗。以流通新鮮空氣。每月須出外旅行一次。行路不可怱促。務宜緩行。夏季食物。不可多食葷菜。最宜素食。</p>
<p>思想切不可破壞。因思想破壞。最易傷身。而於病時尤忌。病時必須平心靜氣。勿性急。勿妄想。宜居住花園之側。冷暖尤當時時注意之。</p>
<p>閒時切勿生邪念。及一切慾望。即有不得意之事。宜靜待解决。勿面現愁容。如遇得意之事亦不可喜形於色。總之宜欣然自得。切勿抱悲觀態度。凡事須知足。切勿妄求。結婚宜遲。色慾務宜力戒。以上諸條。如能按之履行。壽數必然增加。讀者請依法試之。方知吾言之不虛也。</p>
<h3>歐游通信</h3>
<p>（九十四）</p>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡游意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十七）</p>
<p>六月四日丨丨大伽藍聖彼得丨梵諦康教皇宮丨西施庭教堂丨</p>
<p>看過了奧大維石像以後。盤轉身去就看見向在複製片上看慣了的希臘傑作擦垢的少年立像。這是希臘美術後期的大家婁西波斯Ｌｙｓｉｐｐｏｓ（西紀前</p>
<p>）的作品。題名呌擦垢者Ｓｔｈｌｉｔｅ　ｓｅ　ｐｒｏｔｔａｎｔ　ａｖｅｓ　ｌｅ　Ｓｔｒｉｇｉｌｅ即以表現當時人浴時擦垢時的神熊。是希臘的一個描摹人體筯肉活力之最後完成的代表作品而埀爲後世的規範的。這個非常有名的等身大的石像。是一個青年的裸體像。左手伸起。右手拿着擦垢具向左臂摩擦。其特點。腰部描刻得至爲穩實同時胸部稍向前方。西足支持體重。其勢不得不將一足前屈。這樣的表現於靜止的雕像上。可說是獲得最大的人體行動的潑辣性。眞能夠捕捉了人體敏活的核心。這是由於婁西波斯所苦心計劃出的一種均衡。他更把從來以七倍首長爲度者改爲八倍。因此一切筯肉關節。能夠表現壯碩遒勁的活力。據說婁西波斯是亞歷山大大帝的宮廷作家。承傳着泊里克列多Ｐａｌｙｃｌｅｉｔｏｓ（西紀前四六○年頃）的作風。善彫靑年的裸體像。</p>
<p>其次我們瞻仰羅馬巨像。尼羅與十六個愛情之神﹄Ｎｉｌｏ　ａＡｅｃ　Ｉ６　Ａｍｏｕｒｓ那些容貌的偉麗。身軀的壯碩。又是一種天地了。看這古羅馬的傑作。無論是誰。總要驚嘆。總要在這些像中感到羅馬精神的偉大。</p>
<p>這許多希世之珍都是陳列在一間䀞做Ｂｒａｃｃｉｏ　Ｎｕｏｖｏ的大廳裏。曲曲折折在那裏更有許多肖像。和形形色色的獸類走着的躺着的或團聚着的。醒豁活潑。生意盎然。它們的那種豐富和美滿的生命。給予世人以永恒的無量的安慰。</p>
<p>我們盤旋瞻仰了一番之後。走出Ｃｒａｃｃｉｏ　Ｎｕｏｖｏ廳。遠遠望見一個寬大的院落。中間一個噴水池。噴出清冷的水霧。四面的綠茵上雜綴着無數的妍麗的蒔花。幽香典雅。四面走廓的地面都舖着着水磨的磚。同樣地陳列着去彫刻的殘石。游人們成羣結隊。絡繹不絕。欣歡鑽仰。似乎都和時代藝術相混合。不知有自已。不知身處於擾攘的二十世紀。</p>

<h3>紗花標紗一日三變</h3>

<h3>棉市轉軟之主因</h3>
<p>多頭出籠···金價轉疲</p>
<p>棉市氣勞略軟丶因連日多頭放出致檯面較鬆丶浮空抵補似有飽滿之象丶而外棉平靜丶金價轉落丶市氣隨之疲跌丶惟多頭心理以匯兌不長丶難以覲小也丶故新賣戶皆不敢妄動丶目前尙無裂痕發現丶據一部份云丶漢路可通價格當能接近丶故漢帮多數翻空矣丶</p>

<h3>糧食米市突轉堅挺</h3>
<p>靑陽港來源見阻</p>
<p>閘北昨日河到怱稀丶據報靑陽港河道見阻丶致來申米船突乏本街走銷遂轉活動北粳本屬軟化丶至此乃轉堅挺丶高次各粳均喊好角左丶但大勢實不易過於上騰也薄稻到貨亦屬寥寥情况因銷場平而趨穩丶羊秈埠秈一致由疲轉堅丶銷雖不甚爽化丶人心則覺見佳丶大盤稍提半尺丶客秈車到略有丶市勢挺定變元陰化因將屆廢暦歲底糕銷與吊銷均殷丶市價看堅丶特頂白元開十三元半左右丶</p>
<p>滬南昨日各帮到源不多丶市銷平淡丶常錫白粳因稀轉穩丶蘇同白粳買氣略佳丶然各粳行情統告平定丶與上日相彷丶南帮薄早稻此間徵接丶客胃揀好而進吃價極嚴丶市無上落羊杜尖西路來源寥寥丶南路微有丶零胃尙可價守原盤變陰元到銷兩抵高貨曾提近角丶普通中關一律見穩全日南市米情均爲定局之態耳</p>
<h3>廣帮暢辦客元</h3>
<p>價漲角外···甬帮採辦湘</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况頗見活潑丶惟本街以河下米因河道通暢丶將有大批到頭丶對客秈辦意轉淡丶但寗波帮在市搜辦中關各米丶昨日又辦去湘　四百多包丶廣帮亦略有問訊丶廣帮對於客元更爲歡迎丶辦去江西機元一千三百包價比前開較大角外丶統市成交江西機元一百五百包丶價十三元至十　元八角丶又機晚一千包丶價十一元五角二分至三角丶又機早二百包丶價十元零四角二分丶湖南砶米四百十三包丶價十元零五角九分至二角九分丶又機靖五百包丶價十一元七角至十一元丶南京機米一百二十四包丶價九元八角丶滁州糙米八十包丶價八元三角云丶</p>
<h3>洋麥兜售中之粉市</h3>
<p>難免不重生影響</p>
<p>昨日洋麥報價雖互有上落丶但於粉市根本上尙無十分關係丶故人心尙見平定丶迨至下午開盤丶洋行掮客又向各廠及經紀人兜售現貨丶聞澳洲白麥之合價較前又見稍廉祗申元四兩一錢六分丶所以一部份廠家丶對遠期又略拋出丶旋以市氣已疲丶廠拋停止丶至業內外之買賣丶大致以結束之故丶多趨觀望丶觀察後步丶恐以現洋麥之兜售不已丶難免不重生影響也丶結果本月份較前日小二厘半丶二月份小七厘半丶三四月份小五厘丶五月份未動六月份小七厘半云</p>
<h3>麥市重入疲途</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面呈初穩繼疲之象初以洋麥報價互有出入丶人心尙定丶旋因買氣甚寂丶市轉疲勢丶至本月份之籌碼丶聞廠家以自已到貨甚多丶預備收貨者丶爲數無幾丶遠期則又因現麥之兜售丶人心亦爲帶軟丶所以下午幾盤丶交易雖稀丶市面則已疲落矣丶結果本月份較前日小四分丶三四月份小二分丶其他均無比較云丶</p>
<h3>糖市橫濱廠糖續開三萬包</h3>
<p>公會劃市交易均靜</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訉丶古巴現糖不動丶紐約期糖僅五月份回升一分丶餘月亦乏變更爪哇現期糖亦無升降丶公會市場劃盤丶以外匯轉跌丶人氣轉弱丶需要更寥丶荷糖二十四號粗砂白喊十兩零五錢丶香港貨十兩零四錢丶而買方吃價較低丶且問津岑寂丶致無成交丶更以週六翌日未　出貨丶日糖進出亦懈丶明治ＹＴ嘜十兩零五半丶明華貨十兩零五錢丶ＹＰ嘜十兩零七錢丶明治貨十兩零八錢丶亦少受主丶市形甚萎丶太古ＨＸ嘜陳貨由行家方面劃出總計四百七十包丶價元十兩玲二錢丶市尙堅穩丶至該公司兜售新貨丶ＨＸ嘜十兩零四錢ＤＹ嘜十兩零五錢丶仍乏問津丶日糖廠盤有明治糖售開二萬包丶價日金四元六角加稅丶又明華一萬包丶價六元七角連稅丶受手尙覺活躍云丶</p>
<h3>五福白冰明日可到</h3>
<p>五福白冰前以國暦新年停工多日丶茲據函息因申銷甚亟丶故提早開工復煮丶惟地頭連日陰雨丶未能晒乾丶故出品較緩丶已有兩期輪無到丶昨接電訉先有少數裝出預計明日（星期一）可以抵申丶號盤早已喊高丶開價勢必再增云丶</p>
<h3>絲茶滬廠經貨缺銷清</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市丶依然堅挺丶查紐約等處滬白廠經需要頗旺丶歐美各莊進意仍濃丶而各廠商以手貨不充丶原料枯薄丶不敢多拋丶昨計藍　璧等進中身滬白廠經六十包丶三星進川搖經五包丶價益挺秀云丶</p>
<h3>貢熙茶俄銷復活</h3>
<p>在滬辦茶之俄國協助會昨日對於貢熙綠茶丶又復分邀各菜棧進行談判交易丶全市談成一二千箱丶售盤尙未落簿丶惟此次開辦原因丶實由於茶價低廉丶總行電令繼續搜買丶但市上貢熙存底丶不過五千餘箱丶白頭莊尙有一部份銷胃丶實際上頗感供不應求云丶</p>
<h3>油市白桐油漲風稍戢</h3>
<p>白桐油在五年前本在二十兩以下丶自美國銷塲暢旺以來丶近五六年間丶最低價格必在念五兩以上丶最高曾至四十一二兩丶雖爲時甚暫丶然足爲歷史上開一新紀元也乃自上春金價泰漲後丶各國金融無不受其影響美國金融雖稱雄世界丶而商業亦不免艱於發展丶吾國桐油去路丶本以美爲大宗丶而其製造油漆之公司丶因困於金融丶致各　　　丶而　之每　　　　以上之出口丶　一落至千噸以下丶市面劇變丶不喻可知丶各產地始因成本關係尙思維持丶乃遷延數月丶依然生氣毫無丶價格遂由二十七八兩一瀉而至十六七兩丶羣衆目光丶以爲經此鉅創丶須恢復五六年前之狀况矣丶如是者經半年之久丶不意於年底歲首丶漢口各洋行突然搶辦丶而天外奇峯丶蒼龍突現丶一霎時風起雲湧丶不半月間竟漲至二十三四兩可謂極盡幻變矣茲據昨日漢電售洋莊以二十三兩爲正市丶似可穩站矣丶滬上號家在此次急漲聲中丶辦進約有六七千擔丶以浙江油居八九丶價格約在每砠三十元以內丶惟時在冬令丶內地銷清之際丶洋行雖略有去路丶總無從前之暢旺丶聞售價每擔爲二十三兩五六錢最高丶但岑寂已久丶得此活動丶足爲市塲上生色不少丶但願洋行能繼續動辦丶則市面更有立足之地位也丶不然內銷不加捧托丶不免美中不足耳丶</p>
<h3>疋頭愈趨愈高之疋頭</h3>
<p>本廠布漲風甚烈大有扶搖直上之象丶實以出廠稅舉行在即丶各方均恐增加後貨價飛漲丶故本客搜辦甚力丶執貨者一致居奇不售丶所以愈趨愈高丶昨細布復漲一錢左右丶陽鶴彩球喇叭童均七兩出關細斜漲五分丶粗布以九磅貨最缺丶寗波溫台內地等帮採辦俱烈呈供不應求之狀五幅四兩四錢七分半丶現貨尙少丶十一磅布亦已至五兩左右丶粗斜亦略見挺丶怡和漂布昨日又漲二錢丶已達八兩四錢矣丶</p>
<p>東西疋市况續見上漲丶東貨之直貢呢直貢繼又發現新高價丶良以客帮去路異常暢達丶以致行家現貨有隨到隨　之象丶加以匯票始終不肯下落丶人心之激昂丶實爲歷來所罕見丶昨日印花直貢呢已開三錢九分丶中山呢因四川帮採辦甚力丶俱高一分左右丶焦葉題書開三錢丶換太子二錢八分七厘半丶富有四海逍遙津均二錢八分半丶莫干山直貢呢昨已售至三錢八分七厘半獵雁三錢九分二厘半丶一品亦已須三錢五分半丶棉法　富華妃色二錢三分丶梁武帝大紅二錢二分半達磨厚白三錢丶富華白二錢一分半丶此種高價丶實爲近年來所未有丶西貨漂布暴漲有二兩左右丶白洋紗條麻紗元羽綢俱開從來未有之新高價丶放鯉直貢呢亦已達三錢一分矣丶</p>

<h3>關於油畫</h3>
<p>山本鼎著</p>
<p>陳抱一譯</p>
<p>聽說名畫這東西丶非但看起來爽快丶便是甩手撫觸起來也覺得爽快的丶但至於那種生拙的油畫丶祇要一見到那物性感（譯者註丶這是指畫面上表不出色調丶狀量等底美丶而所顯露的丶只見材料丶顏料等的物質感丶丨丨也就是表現空虛丶只能令人感到材料上的素質）丶興致就冰消了丶尤其在那種偏要擬做深刻神氣的丶抑鬱黏滯的靜物畫丶和那種硬要表出有輝艷效色彩來丶而拘凝執念描成的自畫像等裏面丶有一見就令人心胸難過的丶丨丨使人聯想到死尸的皮膚丶腐魚丶陰溝汚泥丶貧乏丶霉丶肺病丶憂鬱症丶那些的丶就是前者丶使人感到鐵屑丶瘡丶象皮腫丶燙泡丶發狂等的丶就是後者丶</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>在生拙的時期丶偏偏又會一定泥執於這物質感的丶畢竟丶泥執的結果丶弄成筆致半死丶顏料堆浮丶遂獨創了這樣的醜拙來丶然而本人丶於其一目瞭然的醜拙上丶竟也感到會心的興味丶而自認爲······眞摯丶漲漫的情熱丶個性丶哲學的情味丶Inspｉｒａｔｉｋｎ（靈感）Ｎｏｌｕｍｅ　（量）等等丶竟看之又看而不厭倦的丶眞是不可思議丶其實丶便是作者丶也何嘗看見﹁自然﹂丶即他們的Ｍｏｔｉｖｅ（畫材丶或畫因）是那么汚濁的丶丨丨這恰像幼兒童的情形一樣丶何以故丶就是丶幼兒童往往會描成直從顏面生出手脚的媽媽和爸爸丶其實丶在他們也未嘗看見人的形狀是那種樣子的丶只不過所看見的東西和所描出來的東西丶是錯誤了丶丨丨也就是同這一樣丶無非念幼稚丶不過他們與兒童稍異之點丶就是自矜一事丶</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>在初學時期丶偏又古怪丶專好用舊畫布丶這並非爲着省儉起見丶而是在乎塗沒了畫來使用（譯者註丶塗沒丶即在曾經繪過的畫布上丶再行繪畫丶結桌丶也就是把下面的畫塗丟的意思）丶無論幾次都要塗沒丶塗得像混凝土板那般重的畫布之所以被珍重的理由丶却說是能使畫呈　深味來的丶然這是迷信丶深味却弄不出丶而倒會弄出懊惱來丶其實丶舊畫布上所作成的重厚味丶和新畫布上所積疊而繪成的重厚味丶其中是有如純質和鍍金的差別丶總而言之丶顏料堆得像瘡疤那樣的舊畫布丶還是不用的好丶雖則也有人把新的畫板丶或畫布丶以白色顏料濃厚地塗上丶塗抹出合意的刷毛紋路丶而待牠充分幹透之後丶才拿來畫的丶但是這種丶自與舊畫布的情形不同丶畢竟丶這是爲要利於將繪的畫丶特地妥善而準備成的畫布丶所以丶新鮮的﹁物質的感味﹂丶是不致爲所害的丶　　○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>舊畫布底愛好者丶又是專考究畫框子的人丶自然也就是寒酸的考究家丶他們的畫框子丶有些是用連皮的木幹外層丶或光鋸下來的木條來自製的個性稜稜的東西丶又有金箔剝落得難看的丶或石膏脫落了的等等丶他們居然把如第二性命一般的畫丶配入這種框子裏丶就拿到展覽會裏去丶却也毫不介意的丶丨丨何以他們對於那種貧相和醜怪丶倒不覺得難過呢丶原來丶他們並不以那種爲貧相丶而却認爲素朴丶並且還感到有原始的悍氣丶不以爲醜丶而却感着一種超俗的品致丶丨丨其實丶如果見得自己的畫是認眞的工作丶那末大過粗陋的畫框子丶還是嫌忌了的好丶無論如何丶我是勸人用新的畫布丶並配畫幅於整然的框子裏而玩賞的丶展覺會的一般出品丶如其永遠都這樣帶着乞丐丶病人丶狂人之相丶那就眞要令人難堪了丶</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>

<h3>法國彫刻界新領袖台畢窩的藝術</h3>
<p>— 陳德明</p>
<p>法國彫刻界領袖一席自從去歲波台爾（Ａｎｔｏｉｎｅ　Ｂｏｕｒｄｄｅｌｌｅ）過世以後已經久懸了丶因爲那爲現代藝術中心的法國有許多第一流的藝人丶換言之丶有許多人可做藝術界的領袖丶因此那因波台爾之出缺而空虛着的法國彫刻界領袖一席的人選問題丶眞是令人煞費躊躇了丶一年以來丶經法國藝術界中的許多威權和著名批評家等的愼重討論考慮丶至最近才以這最高榮譽的法國彫刻界領袖（法國彫刻界領袖實際就是全世界彫刻異領袖）一席給查理台畢窩（Ｃｈａｒｌｅｓ　Ｄｅｓｐｉａｎ）坐了丶</p>
<p>現在我把台氏的生平與藝術介紹於讀者諸君丨</p>
<p>（一）台氏的生平氏生於一八七四年丶初學藝於工藝學校丶繼入官立美術學校　　雷瑙之畫（）參看﹁關於油畫﹂）</p>
<p>專攻彫刻丶卒業時藝已可觀丶可是一時無人賞識丶幸賴其爲人繪描藉揷畫丶掙得微資丶以維生計丶同時他不斷的研究着彫刻丶力求上進丶後來他做了近代彫刻之王羅丹的助手丶他在親炙羅丹之間獲得了不少的彫刻藝術的秘奧丶藝術日進丶可是他那時還是沒沒無聞丶無人過問其作品丶其生活眞是異常的艱難丶氏的成名還是近數年來的事丶</p>
<p>氏天性澹泊丶不慕榮利丶不喜交際丶日惟潛心研究彫刻丶他對於他自己的藝術頗爲自信丶可是他從不大吹大擂丶他這種孤高的性情就是他成名遲晚的原因丶同時也是他所以能有大成的由來丶自來一切眞正的學者和藝人都是像氏那樣的　　（二）台氏的藝術氏所最擅長的肖像與祼體丶氏的肖像彫刻不單求狀貌之畢肖丶他進一步去表現一個人的性格（Ｃｈａａｏｔｅｒ丶他非但表現一個人的性格丶他更進一步去表現一個人的人格（Ｐｅｒｓｏｎａｈｉｔｙ）丶丶非但如此他乃是借了一個人（Ａｎ　Ｉｎｄｉｖｉｄｕａｌ）的狀貌而表現着一時代的人的通性的丶換言之丶他的一具彫像不僅是一個人的肖像丶而是一時代的人的肖像丶他的彫像上面寗靜中有騷動丶騷動中有寗靜丶的確是現代人的寫眞丶在他的彫像上面我們看到現代人的許多悲劇與喜劇丶正如十五世紀時埃克（Ｉａｎ　Ｖａｎ　Ｅｙｃｋ（和十七世紀時的蘭勃朗脫（Ｒｅｍｂｅｒａｎｄｔ）的肖像畫是當時的人的悲劇與喜劇的不朽記錄丶我們在台氏的彫像上看到了那做對象的人的人格丶更看到了現代人的通性丶可是那還不算完丶我們更看到了作者的人格心靈以及所以使那彫像成爲傑作的那種專心一志的工作態度丶</p>
<p>氏的裸體彫刻上所表現的是（一）調和與節奏丶和（二）人們平素悲喜交集的情狀丶　　氏的彫像丶形式簡單而表現深刻丶譬如他爲他的故鄉蒙脫特馬爾桑（Ｍｏｎｔ－ｄｅ－Ｎａｒｓａｎ）彫刻戰爭紀念像丶他只彫了兩個人像丨一個跑禱的老婦和一個年輕的爲人母的婦人丶但是那全國老幼的人對於陣亡將士的痛悼與尊敬已經完全表現在那簡簡單單的一個紀念像上了丶其效果遠勝於一些鋪張揚厲的紀念像丶</p>
<p>除了彫刻之外丶氏又工素描（按彫刻家大都能作素描丶蓋彫刻之前須作速寫圖稿丶羅丹亦係素描能手丶）其素描之生動與變化至爲驚人丶我們在他那些素描裏面看到他對於人生所起的反應丶我們看見他把人生擴大着丶點綴着丶氏的素描實在是比羅丹的素描更美更耐人玩味的丶</p>
<p>上面我們分頭的談着台氏的種切丶其實我們是不能把他分頭討論的丶他的人格和藝術是打成一片的丶他所提到的所熱愛的是那變化萬狀而又是整個底統一底生命丶現代一般藝術家多把生命斬割得四分五裂而表現着丶氏則把生命整個地表視着丶並且賦之以永久的青春丶又丶現代藝術家多喜用抽象的形式來表現生命丶氏則把生命具體地表現着丶概括起來說丶就是現代一般藝術家的藝術大都是殘缺的丶而氏的藝術却是完整的丶一般藝術家的藝術是內容空虛的丶而氏的藝術却是內容充實的丶這是氏與人不同之點丶也就是氏的過人之處丶也是他今日得爲法國彫刻界領袖的由來丶</p>

<h3>Shang Zhen and Others Left Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>There is still no practical solution for disbandment expenses</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang lectured to the generals</p>
<p>Tianjin Shang Zhen had a two-hour conversation with Jing Youyan, a special envoy of the Ministry of Finance, on the afternoon of the 17th. Jing said that it would be difficult to borrow 2 million yuan for disbandment expenses due to collateral issues, but he would definitely find a way to do it. Shang then decided to leave Tianjin, leaving Qiu and Councilor Xie Zongtao in Tianjin to await the funds. At 4 p.m., Zhang Xueliang convened the generals for a lecture lasting two hours. His words were extremely sincere, mainly stating that China has been plagued by internal strife for many years, and the people's strength is exhausted. You gentlemen either hold important border positions or wield military power, and should eliminate violence and bring peace, and engage in construction. I sent troops last autumn to promote peace, and now fortunately the overall situation is unified and politics is on track. You gentlemen love the country and the people, and will not lag behind me. This time, returning to defense and disbanding troops, eliminate the weak and retain the strong, diligently strengthen training, strictly enforce military discipline, internally investigate the people's sentiments, and externally observe the environment. If you do not work together in harmony and strive to become stronger, the future is dangerous, which I cannot bear to say. I hope everyone will encourage each other. At 6 p.m., the generals took their leave and had dinner. At 8 p.m., Shang Zhen, Yang Aiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Xu Yongchang, Pang Bingxun, Gao Guizi, Sun Dianying, etc., successively arrived at the station. At 8:30 p.m., the special train left Tianjin. Song Zheyuan is scheduled to take the early train to Ping tomorrow.

<h3>Wang Zhengting Receives the Press in Beiping</h3>
<p>Answers to Various Diplomatic Matters</p>
<p>Beijing Wang Zhengting received the press this afternoon, with 40 Chinese reporters and 14 European, American, Japanese, and Soviet reporters present. Wang said that he came to Beiping to see the convenience of receiving the Belgian concession and that he had no official business. If there are any questions, he will fully inform. Chinese and foreign reporters asked and answered questions in succession, summarized as follows: (1) Jurisdictional Rights: 13 countries have resolved it out of 19 countries, either fully or with conditional resolution. The countries currently in progress are Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil. The United States is handled by Ambassador Wu, and Britain and France are in Nanjing for negotiation. The other three countries are also proposing separate handling. It is believed that it can be concluded before the National Assembly is convened. (2) Relocation of Embassies to the South: Four or five countries have already done so, and the rest are also preparing. Nanjing has designated an embassy construction area. Reports that I brought a map of the embassy area to Beiping to invite them are nonsensical. Countries will naturally relocate to the South. Why is there a need to raise the issue? (3) Sino-Russian Issues: These are handled in accordance with the Sino-Russian and Eastern Railway Agreements. We are currently waiting for Representative Mo to report before we can know the details of the process and plans. The central government advocates resolving the Eastern Railway issue first, and then discussing trade treaties and other related issues. Specialized committees will be formed, such as Songhua, Heilongjiang, and boundary affairs, etc. Or some specialized committee members will be dispatched to assist Representative Mo in handling matters. Mo will go to Nanjing and return to Russia to take office. There is no replacement of Gu Weijun. As for the restoration of the Russian embassy, it has not yet been discussed. (4) Concession Issues: The cases of the recovery of the Japanese and French concessions in Hankou and Guangzhou Bay have been telegraphed by the respective ambassadors to their countries for instructions. It is believed that a reply will not be obtained. (5) Silver Loan Issues: These are self-directed and self-acted by British, American, and Canadian silver miners. Our government has no such intention. A Japanese reporter asked Wang whether the Minister would return the visit of the American and French ambassadors and the Japanese representative. He replied that there was no need to return the visit. If a return visit is required, please come to Nanjing. Then tea and refreshments were served, and photos were taken before dismissing the meeting. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Investigates Customs Stations Near Railways</h3>
<p>Nanjing The Ministry of Railways stated that the various routes and tax bureaus often have related matters.

Therefore, the Jinghu, Huhu-Hangyong, Pinghan, Pingsui, Bei'ning, Jinpu, Daoqing, Jiaoji, Nanxun, Guangjiu, and Yuehan Railway Bureaus have been instructed to create investigation tables for the various customs stations near the route, stating the station and tax bureau names, affiliated agencies, tax nature, and types of taxed goods, etc., and send them to the Ministry of Finance to distinguish which are the organs that should be abolished and mark them separately so that the various railway bureaus can be informed as a basis. (17th dispatch)</p>

Yu told reporters that the disaster situation in Shaanxi was inspected and spread throughout the province. The area of ​​Weibei in Shaanxi, such as Fufeng, Wugong, Xingping, and Xianyang, was particularly severe. The population loss was 200,000, of which 70,000 to 80,000 fled. Houses were demolished and sold, and only one or two families remained in 50 families. On average, there was one cow in ten families. Wheat seedlings have not yet been planted. A small number of Sichuan troops in southern Shaanxi harassed the area, mixed with the remnants of Feng's troops and local bandits, which still need to be cleared up. Yang's army is concentrated in central Shaanxi, also suppressing bandits in southern Shaanxi, but has not yet reached northern Shaanxi. As for the Gansu province, there are too many troops and the situation is complicated. The people of Gansu all hope that the central government will send personnel to Gansu as soon as possible so that it can be organized in the same way as Shaanxi. Yu left Shaanxi on the 11th, passing through Linru and Zhengzhou, where there were delays. He met Liu Zhi in Bian and stayed in Bian for two days. After arriving in Xuzhou, he inscribed words for local newspapers on the train and was in good spirits. His daughter and secretary accompanied him. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Difficulty of the European Federation</h3>
<p>The European Federal Planning Committee encountered a difficult question at the start of its meeting, namely, whether to invite Russia and Turkey to participate. Briand advocated that it should be considered later, while German Foreign Minister Curtius asked to consider it quickly. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi also demanded that Russia and Turkey be immediately admitted, saying that the European Federation must include all European countries and cannot be omitted, otherwise it will inevitably split all European countries into two major factions. His words are certainly not without merit. However, to incorporate countries with strong historical relations, different economic and political situations, and different races into one group and make them jointly seek development will inevitably lead to divergent opinions and repeated conflicts in the future. It is called a European Federation in name, but it actually achieves nothing. Like the League of Nations, which has an empty name, one must not but consider this. Taking European economy as an example, according to the speech of Dutch representative Colijn today, since 1927, the European economy has deteriorated, and the faith of various countries in the economic work of the League of Nations has declined. If there is no determination to reform, a pan-European tariff war will inevitably occur. The reason why the faith in the economic work of the League of Nations has declined is that the participating countries cannot cooperate and their opinions cannot be unified, resulting in the failure of the tariff truce conference despite repeated meetings. Now, if one wants to transfer the hope previously placed on the work of the League of Nations to the work of the European Federation, if one still cannot fundamentally understand and cooperate effectively, the result may be equally hopeless. Can the new economic policy currently implemented by the Soviet Union be suitable for the economic situation of European countries? Can the economic situation of European countries be suitable for the state of the Soviet Union? Those who understand it know that they cannot be compatible. Then, the economic claims of the Soviet Union after joining the Federation cannot be different, which can be predicted. Therefore, it is a difficult problem whether Russia and Turkey participate, fearing the split of the Federation, and participating, fearing that they cannot cooperate.</p>

<h3>European Federation Conference</h3>
<p>The Issue of Inviting Russia and Turkey to Join</p>
<p>Italian and French Foreign Ministers Argue</p>
<p>The Result is the Organization of a Committee to Consider</p>
<p>Geneva, National, 16th: When the members of the European Federal Planning Committee held their first meeting this morning to consider the European Federal Plan, after a speech by former Dutch Finance Minister Colijn, German Foreign Minister Curtius rose to explain Germany's views on the Federal Plan and asked to quickly consider the issue of inviting Russia and Turkey. French Foreign Minister Briand replied that this session will discuss this, but he believes that the invitation can only be implemented after the European Federation is formed. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi immediately rose in strong opposition, demanding that Russia and Turkey be immediately admitted, declaring that the European Federation must include all European countries without omission, otherwise it can only be called an alliance of states, which will split all European countries into two major factions. Therefore, the invitation should be issued before the Federation is actually established. Finally, he explained the Italian government's view that within the Federation, all states should enjoy absolutely equal political, legal, and economic rights and apply the same degree of disarmament. Then, British Foreign Minister Henderson proposed a compromise solution, on the one hand, to organize a committee to consider the Italian proposal, and on the other hand, to submit this issue to the Executive Council of the League of Nations as soon as possible, because both the League of Nations and this Committee should be regarded as the creators of the European Federation. After Henderson finished his statement, Briand immediately expressed his agreement, and it was passed by the meeting. At that time, Briand, Curtius, Henderson, Grandi, Hymans, etc. were appointed as eight members of the review committee and dispersed. The conference continued in the afternoon, and Dutch representative Colijn spoke about the European economic situation, saying that it has deteriorated since 1927, causing the faith of various countries in the economic work of the League of Nations to decline. If they continue to follow the old path and have no determination to reform, a pan-European tariff war will inevitably occur.</p>

All management committees for education construction, police, etc., should be abolished. However, the originally designated funds for education construction, police, etc., are dedicated funds and the finance bureau shall not change their allocation. If the county government deems there are special circumstances, it may organize a county-wide financial supervision committee to supervise the distribution of various special funds.

(2) The third proposal was to request the dispatch of high officials to comfort Mongolia and Tibet.

(5) The fifty-third proposal was to select local administrative personnel carefully, provide them with ample protection, to encourage capable individuals and respect governance. (6) The seventy-fourth proposal was to request the formulation of regulations for the protection of associate staff in county governments. (Review Opinion) It is proposed that the above four cases be passed in principle and sent to the Ministry of Interior for adoption and implementation. Please vote on whether this is appropriate. Resolved and passed. (7) The eighth proposal was that when cultivating internal affairs talents such as governance, autonomy, and police, Mongolian and Tibetan people should be given special opportunities to receive training. (Review Opinion) It is proposed that the principles be adopted, and the competent authorities should specify the measures in detail, limited to genuine Mongolian and Tibetan people. Resolved and passed. (8) The ninth proposal was to incorporate the seven counties of Jiannan in Sichuan and Hanyuan County into Xikang Province. (Review Opinion) It is proposed that the original proposal be sent to the central government and incorporated into the plan for reducing the size of provinces for unified approval. Resolved and passed. (9) The tenth proposal was to organize the Xikang Provincial Government as soon as possible, determine Batang as the capital of Xikang Province, and rename Batang as Kangding. (Review Opinion) It is proposed that the conference pass it and forward it to the central government for consideration and adoption. Resolved and passed. (10) The eleventh proposal was that all provincial and county governments and other administrative agencies located in Mongolian and Tibetan areas should employ Mongolian and Tibetan personnel to facilitate the development of local affairs. (Review Opinion) It is proposed that the conference pass it. Resolved and passed. (11) The twelfth proposal was to use immigration to solidify the border defense plan.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Dispatches Large Reinforcements to Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Sun Lianzhong and Xu Tingyao Will Enter Jiangxi Successively</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: In order to quickly eliminate the communist bandits, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department recently decided to send four committee members, including Xiong Yuxi, to Beijing to petition for the dispatch of reinforcements to Jiangxi. Xiong and others arrived in Beijing on the 11th and paid a visit to Chairman Chiang on the morning of the 12th to report on the bandit situation in the province and request the dispatch of elite troops to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. According to news from Beijing, Chiang has agreed to dispatch Sun Lianzhong's and Xu Tingyao's troops, about three divisions, to Jiangxi, and they are expected to arrive within a week. Xu's division will go directly to Shangrao, Yiyang, and Duchang in eastern Jiangxi to cooperate with Ruan Zhaochang's and Hu Zuyu's divisions to eliminate Fang Zhimin's and Shao Shiping's bandit groups entrenched in Yiyang. As for the 154th and 156th Brigades of the 52nd Division under Han Deqin, which were sent to Jiangxi by Xu, they have already arrived. Division Commander Han led his division headquarters to Jiujiang on the 13th and immediately supervised the troops to the front line for combat. In addition, Chen Guangzhong, Tao Guang, Xie Bin, and other units of the Fourth Route Army have all advanced to Xiuwu and Tonggu, cooperating with the 47th and 54th Divisions to encircle and suppress the Kong and Li bandits. Wang Jinyu has also established a joint anti-bandit headquarters of the three provinces in Pingxiang. The bandit groups of Zhu De and Mao Zedong are not worth worrying about. As for the Gong and Luo Divisions of the Ninth Route Army, they are currently stationed in Ji'an and Yongfeng, with solid defense works near Jicheng, making the area very peaceful. However, the 50th Division retreated to Fuzhou due to strategic considerations and is now advancing from Le'an. The New 13th Division under Lu Xiaochen has reinforced Yihuang from Fuzhou. The Eighth Division continues to advance from Nanfeng. Therefore, the current situation of bandit suppression is better than during the New Year. It is reported that Chiang believes that the communist bandits are unusually cunning and move from one place to another, making them difficult to eliminate. He has specially telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Lu, stating that those who capture bandits' guns will be given the first credit, and those who capture cities will be given the second credit. Lu has relayed the telegram to all commanders in Jiangxi. (January 14th)</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Stagnation of Fujian's Political Situation</h3>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang Is Still Negotiating Finance in the Central Government</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The order for the resumption of duties of provincial commissioners has been issued for a long time. Except for Cheng Shijun, who first arrived in the province to take charge of the Department of Education, Xu Xianshi, the head of the Department of Construction, will only take charge after Chairman Yang returns to Fujian. Lin Zhiyuan, Zheng Baojing, and Wu Shu are still in Beijing and Shanghai and have not returned south. It is rumored that Yang has recommended Zheng to succeed as the head of the Department of Civil Affairs, but the official order has not yet arrived. The reason for this is that Yang's return to Fujian is closely related to the financial issue. Lin and Zheng are running between Beijing and Shanghai for this issue. After the abolishment of likin, Fujian's income has sharply decreased. Without solving this problem, there is almost no politics to speak of. Recently, it was heard that Yang sent a telegram to Chen Peikun, stating that he was negotiating with the central government on financial matters and that there were already signs of progress. He would inform Chen of the return date after proper negotiation. Therefore, Yang cannot return south temporarily until the financial issue is settled with the central government, which has resulted in the invisible stagnation of the political situation. Recently, Zhang Zhen telegraphed the province to request the allocation of back pay, and Commander-in-Chief Chiang also telegraphed to quickly order the Department of Finance to allocate funds to Liu's division for bandit suppression and to issue pay to Zhou Ziqun's and Zhang Ziming's units, all of which are related to finance. It is clear from this that Yang cannot return to Fujian soon. (January 14th)</p>
<h3>The Financial Straits of Guangdong After the Abolition of Likin</h3>
<p>Fan Qiwu Resolutely Resigns as Finance Commissioner</p>
<p>Remedies: Division of National and Provincial Taxes and Reduction of Military Spending</p>
<p>Guangdong News: Guangdong Province has issued an order to implement the abolition of likin starting from New Year's Day. However, in reality, likin is a major source of revenue for the Guangdong treasury. According to financial circles, Guangdong's annual revenue will decrease by approximately 11 million yuan after the abolition of likin, while new special taxes have not yet been implemented. Moreover, during the period of military operations in Guangxi Province, temporary military expenses are approximately more than one million yuan per month and cannot be reduced for the time being. Therefore, Fan Qiwu, the Director of the Department of Finance and Finance Commissioner, is at a loss. He recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to resolutely resign from the position of Finance Commissioner, stating that the position of Finance Commissioner in Guangdong Province is impossible to handle and that the various difficulties cannot be fully expressed. Those who have not experienced it firsthand cannot know the difficulties and hardships. Last August, he was approved to send someone to replace him, but unfortunately, the rebellion broke out again. Following the ancient maxim of a mother not shying away from danger, he had to exert his remaining strength and勉力support. Now that the great disaster has subsided, he is like an ox or horse overburdened for too long and asks for compassion and rest, requesting to resign from the position of commissioner to conform to the great teachings of the 20th year. If the position of commissioner of finance must be combined with the Department of Finance, then please resign from both positions to feel grateful. His subordinate, Fan Qiwu, kowtows, etc. The Ministry of Finance replied that he should be retained. All these matters are known. Before things are on track, all kinds of difficulties are inevitable. Financial authorities, whether central or local, only bear the heavy burden of oxen and horses. Since he has been able to cope calmly in times of repeated dangers, and now that construction has begun, there is an even greater need for his services. Please, in any case, endure the difficulty. As mentioned in the previous telegram, coming to Beijing for a talk is even more beneficial. How can you expect a positive reply? After receiving the reply telegram, Fan initially planned to go to Beijing to personally report the bitter situation, but the trip was slightly delayed due to the news that Minister Song was going to Tianjin. According to Fan's intention, the financial difficulties in Guangdong Province after the abolition of likin are undeniable. He really does not want to be the Finance Commissioner anymore, because he is indeed hesitant about raising military expenses. As it stands, it is really difficult to cope with the situation without the central government allocating 500,000 yuan per month to supplement the funds. The compensation for the abolition of likin was originally hoped to be made up by levying special taxes. Although the central government has stipulated 19 kinds of special taxes, according to the local conditions in Guangdong Province, there are very few taxable materials, and only about 8 kinds are qualified to be levied. The regulations for the textile consumption tax have been drafted and are being prepared. The other special taxes that should be levied are also being drafted as soon as possible to facilitate implementation. However, it is still questionable whether they can proceed smoothly after they are launched, and since the abolition of likin has been implemented since this month, the special taxes being prepared may not be able to alleviate the urgent need. As for reorganizing general finance, the provincial government is now actively promoting the division of national, provincial, municipal, and county taxes in the province. Chen Mingshu, the chairman of the provincial government, reported on the 20th-year implementation guidelines at the Provincial Representative Assembly on the 7th, and spoke very earnestly about requesting the central government to divide national, provincial, municipal, and county tax revenues, saying that whether the administrative guidelines of the province can be implemented depends fundamentally on whether the national and provincial taxes can be effectively divided. From a pessimistic point of view, since likin has been abolished, it will naturally affect income. If military expenses are not effectively reduced, there is currently no way to remedy the situation. However, Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, mentioned the current financial difficulties in his military report at the Provincial Representative Assembly on the 6th, saying that in the future, we can only reduce the army and save temporary military expenses as a remedy. However, this assumes that Guangxi Province will be resolved peacefully. If the peace talks with Guangxi break down and military operations are resumed, it is still unknown whether the so-called reduction of troops and military spending can be realized. (January 10th)</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of Judge Ha's Murder Case</h3>
<p>The Prosecutor Announces the Reasons for the Indictment</p>
<p>Ye Yixiong Narrates the Facts of What Happened</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The case of Ye Yixiong, a judge of the Eastern Provinces Special District Local Court, killing the widow Zhang Wang Liqing on November 23 last year, has been investigated by the Binjiang Court Procuratorate for many days. As the victim, Zhang Wang Liqing, was unable to appear in court for questioning due to her injuries, and the case could not be delayed for long, the case was sent for trial on January 4, based on the confession recorded by the Central Hospital. The prosecutor's reasons for the indictment were attempted murder and embezzlement of property. In order to carefully handle the case, the court specially appointed Jia Jingyang, the presiding judge of the criminal court, as the main trial judge. The first hearing was held at 3:00 PM on January 12. The judges present were Jia Jingyang, the presiding judge of the criminal court, and Zheng Xuan, the prosecutor. Approximately thirty men and women attended as observers, most of whom were lawyers, while the rest were Ye's family members. Ye's wife, Peng Churui, also attended. When she saw her husband, she frequently wiped away tears with two or three other women. Ye was brought to the waiting room at about 1:00 PM that day. The instruments of torture had been removed. He wore a black Turkish-style leather hat, a Chinese-style cloak, and gray cotton shoes, looking haggard. After being imprisoned for more than fifty days, his hair and beard were disheveled, and he no longer had his former elegant demeanor. His body and voice trembled slightly during the interrogation, as he was at a critical juncture of life and death. The plaintiff, Zhang Wang Liqing, and her lawyer, Chi Longshi, were not present. After the clerk announced the reasons for the trial, Judge Jia began to question Ye Yixiong, asking, "How old are you?" He replied, "(Ye Yixiong) 31 years old." Asked, "What province are you from?" He replied, "Minhou, Fujian Province." Asked, "Where do you live here?" He replied, "Fourteenth Street, Daoli." Asked, "What is your occupation?" He replied, "Serving as a judge in the Special District Court." Asked, "Is it a full post or an alternate?" He replied, "Alternate." Asked, "Who are the members of your family?" He replied, "Wife, daughter, brothers, etc." Asked, "Do you have any property?" He replied, "Yes, I have property." Asked, "What school did you attend?" He replied, "Russian Legal and Political School in Beijing." Asked, "Have you ever committed a crime before?" He replied, "I have never committed a crime before." At this point, Judge Jia asked Zheng Xuan, the original prosecutor who was present, to announce the reasons for the indictment, which stated that "After investigation, Zhang Liqing met Ye in February of last year and had an ambiguous relationship. On November 23 last year, Zhang planned to return to Beiping and remitted 7,050 yuan through the Bank of Communications, taking the remittance slip to Beiping. Ye Yixiong saw the money and had malicious intent, pretending to send Zhang off in the name of going to Beiping. On November 23, Ye secretly carried a Browning pistol and boarded the train with her. At 12:30, when the train reached Shuangchengpu Station, Ye tricked Zhang into getting off the train to play, luring her to the second warehouse of Shuangcheng Station and attempting to shoot and kill Zhang Liqing. He committed the crime of attempted murder and embezzlement of money, and should be punished by the court in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 12 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits" (Note: Article 1, Paragraph 12 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits, promulgated on November 18, 1927, clearly states that those who commit robbery and intentionally kill people, causing injury resulting in death, or causing serious illness, or injuring more than two people, shall be sentenced to death).</p>
<p>At this point, the judge asked Ye Yixiong, "Did you meet Zhang Liqing on the train when you went to Changchun and she returned to Beiping on the Double Tenth Festival of the year before (1929)?" (Answer) The circumstances of how I met Zhang Liqing are very complicated. Please allow me to narrate the past facts from beginning to end. The judge allowed it. Ye then stated, "The husband of Ms. Zhang, Zhang Ziming, and I were originally acquainted. When Zhang Ziming died, I went once. After the Double Tenth Festival, I often went to Ms. Zhang's house to chat, and a kind of affection developed. At that time, because Zhang was a widow, I strictly kept the secret to protect her reputation, so that people would not know the details. Later, I became good friends with Ms. Zhang, and it goes without saying that after a long time, I handled most of Ms. Zhang's affairs. The two of us were already inseparable. The first time Ms. Zhang said she wanted to go back to Beiping, she put all her deposit books, seals, and valuables in my custody, because I had two boarding places, one at home and one at the court dormitory, so it was convenient to store Ms. Zhang's belongings together. Ms. Zhang had previously told me that she wanted to spend her days with me, but I did not agree. At one time, because I had a wife at home, it was inconvenient, and because Ms. Zhang was a new widow and had savings of 20,000 yuan, it would sound bad to outsiders as if I were plotting for money. For the sake of protecting her reputation, I gave up on this matter. Ms. Zhang was very dissatisfied at the time and said that I did not believe in her sincerity. Then, Ms. Zhang gave me a 4,000-yuan deposit ticket and said that if you do not believe in my sincerity, keeping this money safe for you can be believed. At the time, because there were difficult places, I did not agree after all. Later, Ms. Zhang handed over all the deposit books and signature seals, and things like deposits, completely to me to handle. From then on, our interactions became unusually intimate, and we often went out to play together at night, especially in the summer of last year. Sometimes at the riverside or the Water Sports Association, when it was too late, I would send her back. Once, we went the farthest, walking along the river to an unknown place, and watched some fishing. At that time, I always carried my gun with me, and Ms. Zhang knew it. If I wanted to harm her, how easy it would have been. Like at the water's edge late at night, I could have done whatever I wanted. Moreover, at that time, I had a large amount of money in my custody. Why would I have been greedy for this small amount later? This is what happened in the past. Later, Ms. Zhang planned to withdraw her shares from the soy sauce garden, but due to various reasons, it could not be done, so she wanted to return to Beiping. The day before, which was the 21st, Ms. Zhang again put her things in my custody. In addition to remitting 7,050 yuan, there was also 800 yuan, which I also remitted to Beiping. We then agreed to leave together on November 23. The train tickets and sleeping berth, etc., were all arranged by me for her. Later, in the car, because I was wearing two sets of woolen clothes, I felt very hot and planned to change my pants. But I did not bring any luggage, and there was nowhere to put the clothes after I took them off, so I asked Ms. Zhang for the key to open the suitcase to put the clothes in her suitcase. If Ms. Zhang had not given me the key, perhaps nothing would have happened. This giving of the key has ruined my reputation for life (to be continued)."</p>
<h3>Outline of Regulations for Business Tax Collection in Various Provinces Set by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, considering the implementation of tax reductions is underway and methods of offsetting the resulting deficits urgently need to be decided, has, in addition to determining that consolidated taxes and special taxes should offset the central government's losses from tax reductions and business taxes should offset local losses, now specially formulated nine articles of the "Outline for Business Tax Collection in Various Provinces" and thirteen articles of supplementary measures.

However, for special businesses, the standard may be based on the amount of capital or other calculation methods. (Article 4) The business tax rate shall be calculated using the per mille method based on the taxation standard, and shall not exceed two per mille. However, this shall not apply to luxury businesses and others that should be subject to restrictions. (Article 5) When collecting business tax, each province shall establish a Business Tax Evaluation Committee, whose members shall be composed of tax officials, representatives of chambers of commerce, and designated accountants. (Article 6) The amounts of business tax collected by each province shall be announced in the newspaper monthly by the collecting agency, and a collection credit record shall be compiled annually, reviewed by the Business Tax Evaluation Committee, and signed and published by all members. (Article 7) After the implementation of the business tax, the original brokerage tax, pawnshop tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes of the same nature as the business tax in each province shall be abolished. (Article 8) Regulations and implementation rules for business tax collection shall be formulated by each province in accordance with this outline and reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification and record. (Article 9) The collection of business tax by each province shall be implemented after the completion of the elimination of likin.</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures to the Outline for Business Tax Collection in Various Provinces (Article 1) In addition to the provisions of Article 1 of the Outline, banks, special companies, and the tobacco and alcohol industries that already pay license taxes are not within the scope of the business tax in each province. (Article 2) Businesses with operating capital of less than 500 yuan are exempt from business tax. (Article 3) All business operators must apply for a business license within one month after the publication of this outline and supplementary measures, and within the last month of each subsequent year.

Within this one-year period, it shall not be reduced or increased. (Article 4) The collection period shall be monthly or quarterly, as determined by the provinces themselves according to the circumstances. (Article 5) Business tax shall be paid directly to the competent authority by the taxpayer and shall not be contracted or handled by others. (Article 6) For businesses that sell goods and whose taxable standard is the amount of business income, the tax rate for wholesale businesses may be appropriately reduced compared to retail businesses.

(Article 9) The competent authorities of each province shall compile a report form on the amount of business tax silver collected each quarter and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The Ministry of Finance may also send personnel to assess it at any time. (Article 10) With the approval of the National Government, the Ministry of Finance may select industries for tax collection and reduce or exempt tax rates. (Article 11) Although brokerage tax, pawnshop tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes of the same nature as business tax have been merged in accordance with the Outline, in order to temporarily safeguard local revenue, it can be handled in two steps. The first step is to rename brokerage, pawnshop, slaughter, and other taxes as business tax, and the tax rate shall still be collected according to the original tax rates for brokerage, pawnshop, and slaughter taxes as a temporary transitional measure. The second step is to change the aforementioned original tax rates to business tax rates after the business tax is properly handled, so as to unify them. (Article 12) Provincial taxes and county taxes are different for the land tax in each province. Business tax comes from the county residents, and its burden is similar to the land tax. In the future, the business tax collected should be allocated for county use. The provincial government shall consider the losses of each county due to tax reduction and allocate it properly. The allocated funds shall first be used for projects that have insufficient funding due to tax reduction, so that they can be maintained continuously. (Article 13) When each province conducts business tax, it should still comply with the central government's standards for dividing national and local revenues and expenditures, and prohibit the addition of surcharges in order to comply with the approved plan and alleviate the people's hardships.</p>

<p>Small Boat Robbed in Broad Daylight in Xiyi The local inland river small boats were temporarily suspended due to the extremely cold weather and frozen waterways. Recently, the weather has warmed slightly, and they have resumed operations, with passengers being quite crowded. At 8:00 AM on the 17th, when the Dexin small boat of the Yangxian Company's Xiyi line departed, five bandits purchased tickets and boarded the boat, disguised as passengers. At 8:15, when the boat arrived at Panfeng, Huangshiliu (Wan'an City), the five bandits suddenly rose up and made trouble, brandishing a pistol and two Mauser pistols, and forced the boat to stop. At that time, several bandits on the shore also responded by firing shots. The crew, fearing that firing back would injure people, had to stop the boat. The bandits on the shore immediately jumped onto the boat and looted wildly, spending half an hour before taking the stolen goods ashore and leaving. It is estimated that five fur coats and silver dollars were robbed from the passengers, and the losses on the boat amounted to about two or three thousand yuan. After the robbery, the crew rushed to the Shitan Bay (Shitan Bay is about five li from Panfeng) business group to report and request pursuit. They also called the city. Mr. Yu, the manager of the company, immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau after receiving the news. The ship is still heading to Yixing and will provide a detailed list of losses after returning to Wuxi and report it to the county government to pursue the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Heard About Abduction Case Near the Train Station Mr. Qiang, a local elder in Taibo City, received a threatening letter after the major robbery and abduction case occurred at Xiaoqiaotou between Taibo and Jingzhong Markets in the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, demanding 200,000 yuan. Mr. Qiang dismissed it with a laugh. On the 9th of this month, Mr. Qiang took a car from Zhoujing Port to the city. Mr. Qiang used to run the local defense corps in the countryside, so he ordered an armed member to accompany him for protection. When the car arrived at the Wuxi station, Mr. Qiang ordered the armed member to return to the countryside first. As the armed member was walking near the staff dormitory of the train station, three bandits suddenly stepped forward and stopped him, brandishing a pistol to prevent him from making noise. They forced Mr. Qiang to a certain hotel on the road to negotiate. The bandits initially demanded 20,000 yuan, but after a long discussion, they reduced it to 15,000 yuan. The bandits forced Mr. Qiang to immediately write a note to the bank. Two bandits then confined Mr. Qiang to the room, while one bandit took the note to the bank to collect the money. The banker hesitated to pay because he didn't know why Mr. Qiang needed so much cash. The bandit said that if they didn't believe it, they could call the hotel to ask. The banker called to inquire, and Mr. Qiang personally replied that they should pay quickly. The banker then paid the full amount. After the bandits got the money, they called the two bandits in the hotel, saying that the money had been received. The bandits thanked Mr. Qiang and locked the door before leaving. Mr. Qiang was then freed.</p>

<p>Police and Others Destroyed Bandit Den The Shangdong Village of Fucheng Township, Wuyi District, had been harassed by bandits twice before. Both times, the military police went to the countryside to fiercely suppress them, and the bandit Song Tailor was beheaded and displayed to the public, causing the villagers of Shangdong to have an even deeper feud with the bandits. The bandits often threatened revenge. On the 15th, another large group of bandits planned to go to Shangdong Village to burn and kill, and gathered at the Yuantong Nunnery bandit den in Qiujiatou first. Upon hearing the news, the villagers were immediately on guard and urgently reported to the county police force to go to the countryside to suppress them. After the police arrived, they went with the broadsword team to surround the Yuantong Nunnery. The bandits in the nunnery immediately came out to fight back. For a time, gunshots rang out continuously. After two hours, the bandit force was defeated, and they retreated one after another. The bandit leader Chen Songlin was physically large. During the fierce battle, he lay on the roof to direct the battle. The broadsword team rushed forward and slashed him several times. After being injured, he fell from the roof and was immediately beheaded by the broadsword team. At the same time, bandits Zhu Jinkun and Guan were captured. A total of fourteen people were captured. On the afternoon of the 16th, the police escorted the captured bandits, firearms, and heads to the city. The heads were hung at the Dabeimen for public display.

<p>Financial Department Recovers Old Outstanding Grain and Tax Debts The Financial Department has been trying to recover the old outstanding busy Cao Lu Ke and other taxes from the counties for the years 1927, 1928, and 1929. The cumulative debt amount of the whole province reached 2 million and several hundred thousand yuan. The Provincial Government put it up for a meeting and decided to urge the payment (in order to offset the budget deficit in the second half of this year). The government issued an order to categorize the debts into written debts and people's debts, and gave a strict deadline to collect the payments within the shortest possible time. The order requested to submit a report of the progress in batches. Now the Provincial Government had approved to list the aforementioned old outstanding debts in the new increased budget revenue of 1 million yuan. It is necessary to establish concrete measures to strictly urge the payments. Therefore, yesterday, another order was issued to the directors of the financial bureaus of each county to actively proceed, first compile and submit to the department a clear list of the outstanding debts over the years, and then investigate and urge the payment of the written and people's debts separately, and collect them within six months. At least 50% of the old debts must be collected, with a proportionate amount allocated for submission each month. No shortage is allowed. Those who play around with writing, act cunningly, or resist the order will be severely punished.</p>

When the bandits finished robbing the oil shop, the Zhapu-Pinghu steamship returned from Pinghu (the steamship was moored at the town due to the opening of the river, which is only three li from Zhapu and accessible by car). The bandits forced their way into the ship and robbed the passengers one by one. More than 200 silver dollars were robbed, and the total loss was about 1,000 yuan, including the losses on the ship. The Zhapu Public Security Branch Office rushed to report to Pinghu, and the patrol team and the water police patrol team dispatched police to apprehend the bandits.

It is estimated that there are more than 60 people led by Lu Yaosheng in He Wangdai, more than 100 people led by Jin Fei and Shi Quanlaoban in Qianjiawei and Nanlu, more than 50 people led by Qian Dexing in Xieqiao, and the bandit nest in LiujiaYan and the bandits near Luowan Temple have obtained more than 500,000 yuan after looting Xinzao Town. They have enough ammunition and weapons. Everyone wears a coat. They recruit those who join for 30 yuan. Therefore, robberies and extortions in the eastern countryside are a daily occurrence. What is even more hateful is that young girls in the countryside who have some beauty are robbed. Xingbao of Guo Wenlin in Zhaoqiao was taken away by bandits, and a woman surnamed Lin on the opposite street was also occupied. Taibao Ashu and Zhuluo Amei each have more than ten concubines. The bandits in Quanggongting recently stated that they will borrow 50,000 yuan from Qianzhen, otherwise they will take drastic measures. Therefore, the townspeople are very panicked.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Execution of a Company Commander Who Lost Taishun The Provincial Government previously ordered the Security Team Fourth Regiment to send Company Commander Jin Cheng, who lost the county seat of Taishun, for investigation. It was found that Qian Company Commander was stationed in Xixi, five li away from Taishun County City (more than 20 li from Shouning County, Fujian). At that time, the Fujian bandits headed by He Jinbiao were appearing in Nanxia and Xixi. After receiving a report on the evening of August 27th, the company commander did not suppress them because the territory belonged to Shouning. He only sent sentries to guard each city gate. On the morning of the 28th, bandits were found on the South Gate. The company commander then assigned all his troops to defend. The bandits came from the south. The soldiers guarding the South Gate retreated because they ran out of ammunition. The company commander also led his troops to retreat, and the county magistrate and the police followed suit, resulting in the loss of the county seat. One soldier was killed by the bandits, three were injured, and many guns were lost. The Provincial Government believed that since the company commander was stationed in Taishun, he should have immediately suppressed the bandits regardless of the border. Instead, he was timid and watched. When the bandits approached the city, he did not launch a head-on attack, nor did he firmly defend the city. He retreated hastily and lost the county seat. He was guilty of inexcusable crimes and should be sentenced to death in accordance with the Military Law of the Army, Navy and Air Force. This morning (17th) at 9 AM, the company commander was taken out to verify his identity and executed by firing squad in the execution ground of the Army Prison to warn others.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Expressing Opinions on the Business Tax</h3>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to the Tax Rate and Collection Method</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the resolution of the Executive Committee meeting yesterday, sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting attention to the business tax rate and collection method. The original telegram stated: "Article 4 of the Business Tax Outline stipulates that the business tax rate should be calculated and collected using the permillage method based on the taxable standard, and should not exceed two per mille, except for luxury businesses and other businesses that should be banned. Furthermore, Article 8 of the supplementary measures stipulates that the maximum tax rate based on the amount of capital should not exceed twenty per mille. Article 13 of the same measures stipulates that when provinces implement the business tax, they should still comply with the central government's standard for dividing national and local revenue and expenditure and prohibit the addition of surtaxes. Article 2 of the supplementary measures stipulates that businesses with capital less than 500 yuan are exempt from business tax. Article 6 of the outline stipulates that when provinces collect business tax, a business tax review committee should be established, with members consisting of collection officials, representatives from the chamber of commerce, and designated accountants. The above regulations are all aimed at preventing excessive taxation and ensuring that merchants have the opportunity to participate in discussions beforehand. The planning is comprehensive and deeply appreciated. Since the preparation of the business tax in various provinces and cities involves the tax rate and lacks a basis, they inevitably act on their own, leading to discrepancies. Now, an order from the Yuan has instructed the thirteen supplementary measures stipulated by the Ministry to be sent to various provinces and cities for compliance. From now on, there will be a clear guideline. If the drafts proposed by various provinces and cities are not fully consistent with the outline and supplementary measures, it is proposed that they be revised one by one and examined by the Yuan and the Ministry at any time to comply with the regulations. As for what constitutes a luxury business and what contains the nature of a ban, the standard is not easy to determine, and careful consideration is especially important. The outline stipulates that representatives from the chamber of commerce should be selected as review committee members. The Zhejiang business tax draft extensively invites representatives from the business community to join the discussion, all for the purpose of gathering ideas and expanding benefits. The public sentiment is deeply admired. For all business classifications and their tax collection methods, it is proposed that the business community be allowed to participate in expressing opinions and to make appropriate arrangements to eliminate misunderstandings and promote benefits. This was resolved at the tenth executive committee meeting of the affiliated associations on the 16th of this month and has been telegraphed separately. It is respectfully requested that approval be granted for the convenience of the public. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xiao."</p>

I am deeply gratified to see the enthusiastic participation of leaders from various industries. In the past, when I was in charge of industry and commerce, I took it as my duty to concentrate the national strength and develop direct overseas trade. Recently, the National Industrial and Commercial Conference resolved to establish the China International Trade Association, and the Ministry selected several important industrialists, businessmen, and overseas Chinese business leaders as preparatory committee members to engage in organization and to plan to establish a large-scale international trading company in the shortest possible time for the active development of foreign commerce. At that time, Xiangxi separately sent letters of invitation and designated Zhang Gongquan and Chen Guangfu as the two committee members responsible for the convocation. It took more than two months to complete the preparations. On the occasion of the opening, Xiangxi is deeply honored to attend this grand event. The amount of China's trade deficit has been increasing year by year, and the backwardness of industry is undeniable. In the past two years, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has made many plans to encourage international trade, such as the establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau and the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the dispatch of commercial commissioners stationed abroad, and the dispatch of representatives to attend the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Silk Conference, all as preparatory work for promoting international trade. However, the revitalization of international trade relies not only on the promotion of the government, but also on the efforts of the merchants themselves. The government's responsibility is first to eliminate obstacles to the development of international trade, to indicate the path of international trade development, and to study programs and provide information. Actual progress depends on collective efforts and close cooperation. The American International Trade Council, Foreign Trade Council, founded in 1914, in addition to engaging in investigation, research, liaison, and guidance, also holds an annual meeting in important commercial centers every year. All important American commercial groups stationed abroad and commercial commissioners stationed abroad send representatives to attend, discuss, and study in detail. The intention is far-reaching and can be used as a model. Now that the organization of the Ministry of Industry is just beginning and this association is established at the right time, it is hoped that all sectors of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce throughout the country will adapt to the new environment with a new spirit and work together to fully implement the scientific and standardized approach, so that international trade can make substantial progress and the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood can be realized as soon as possible. As the saying goes, it is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep. Perseverance will penetrate metal and stone. Xiangxi is willing to encourage all gentlemen of this association together." After Kong delivered his speech, he left the meeting due to other business and asked Mr. Zhang Gongquan to act as chairman. After Mr. Zhang took his seat, he continued the report, saying briefly: "Mr. Chen Guangfu and I were elected by the Industrial and Commercial Conference last year to prepare for the China International Trade Association. It has been more than two months, and we have been assisted by Mr. Shou Yicheng and Mr. Ren Sida in the preparations, so that we can now establish the association in a rough manner. Now, according to the agenda, we will discuss the articles of association and ask Mr. Ren to read them out." The committee members studied and discussed for more than an hour before completing the discussion and approval of all the articles. Next, the directors were elected by ballot. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>List of Directors. A total of seventeen directors were elected: Zhang Gongquan (42 votes), Chen Guangfu (38 votes), Zou Bingwen (34 votes), Liu Hongsheng (29 votes), Ren Sida (28 votes), Lin Kanghou (28 votes), Cheng Ouchu (27 votes), Shou Yicheng (26 votes), Xu Jili (23 votes), Guo Bingwen (23 votes), Zhao Jinqing (18 votes), Xu Xinliu (3 votes), Zheng Hongnian (12 votes), Zhou Yichun (12 votes), Shi Bo'an (11 votes), Wu Jian (11 votes), Li Fuxun (11 votes), etc. Chen Jiageng (10 votes), Rong Zongjing (10 votes), Zhu Mouxian (10 votes), Xue Minlao (9 votes), Li Zushen (9 votes), Hu Mengjia (8 votes), Qian Xinzhi (8 votes), Chen Zheqing (8 votes), Tang Jishan (8 votes). The above nine people were elected as alternate directors. Temporary Proposal. Lin Kanghou made a temporary proposal, namely, the issue of China's merchants joining the International Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Lin reported: "The International Chamber of Commerce was previously presided over by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Zhu Yinjiang, Shou Yicheng, Zhang Xianglin, and other gentlemen were recommended to attend the conference in the Netherlands last year. I believe you can still remember this. Now, since the International Chamber of Commerce has expressed great appreciation after our country attended, the association has reported that 45 countries have joined, but China has not formally joined. The secretary-general of the association has repeatedly sent letters to our country asking us to join, but due to a lack of talent and finances, it has been delayed until now. Today, the China International Trade Association has been established. I suggest that the association quickly find a way to join so that international merchants can have contact. As for the membership fees of joining the International Chamber of Commerce, I am willing to work with Mr. Zhang Gongquan and others to find a way so that you will not have to bear any burden." After the report was completed, all the committee members present agreed with Mr. Lin's proposal. The chairman agreed to hand over the proposal to the board of directors for further discussion, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>The Policy of the Anti-Smoking Association Has Not Changed</h3>
<p>Reply to the Letter from the National Anti-Drug Association</p>
<p>The Central Anti-Smoking Committee received a letter from the Shanghai National Anti-Drug Association yesterday, inquiring whether the recent report that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued an English declaration that the government was preparing to manage opium trade and change the policy of complete prohibition was true, and requesting a reply. The committee immediately replied, stating that the rumors were groundless. The original letter is excerpted below: "Respectfully replying, we received your letter, inquiring whether the recent report that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued an English declaration that the government was preparing to manage opium trade and change the policy of complete prohibition was true, and requesting a statement. This committee is in charge of anti-smoking administration and should follow the government's policy and proceed in an orderly manner to achieve results. The government has long had regulations on all implementation plans for anti-smoking administration. Since the government has not changed its policy, it is impossible for the administration to violate the law. The rumors are groundless, and the facts will be easily understood. As for the declaration issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there were errors in the original meaning and translation. Previously, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health, according to the Regulations on the Management of Narcotic Drugs, planned to establish a general management agency for narcotic drugs to handle the import, export, and transportation of narcotic drugs needed for legitimate medical and scientific purposes nationwide, which is not to manage the national opium trade. The misunderstanding may be due to this. We are responding accordingly and requesting that you take note."</p>
<h3>The International Radio Station Will Communicate with Myanmar</h3>
<p>Sino-French Telegraph to be Realized Next Month</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Trial Telegraph Not Yet Scheduled</p>
<p>The Zhenru International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications had previously tested Sino-French communication at the beginning of the year with good results. Recently, due to the cold weather and frozen water pipes, it is urgent to repair them. The station is scheduled to re-test on the 19th, and the call signs have also been changed. One is XGR, with a wavelength of 26.03 meters, and the other is XGQ, with a wavelength of 16 meters. Formal communication is scheduled to begin in early February. In addition, the station will soon communicate with Myanmar. The Ministry of Communications and the Myanmar government have negotiated a radio contract. Regarding the Sino-Japanese trial communication, it was reported from Beijing that the Fenglinqiao Radio Station would conduct trial communication with Osaka and Nagoya, Japan, starting from the 20th. According to news from the International Radio Station Office yesterday, the station has not yet received orders. The Fenglinqiao Radio Station originally communicated with Manila and Java, and communication with Japan is possible.</p>
<h3>Details of the Guangdong Warship's Fierce Suppression of the Xinming Steamer Robbery Case</h3>
<p>The Battle of Tianma Mountain</p>
<p>Eight Pirates Captured</p>
<p>Five Hostages Rescued</p>
<p>The Xinming steamer of the China Merchants Bureau was robbed, and passengers and crew were kidnapped. After General Manager Li Zhonggong telegraphed to the Guangdong Navy to pursue and rescue the hostages, the Zhongshan warship rescued the kidnapped hostages. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Guangdong fleet telegraphed Shanghai to report the pursuit of the pirates and the investigation of the case. The details are reported below.</p>
<p>Fierce Pursuit of Pirates. Commander Chen Ce of the Guangdong Fleet, after receiving the telegram from the China Merchants Bureau reporting the Xinming incident, immediately dispatched Councilor Cai to lead a team of marines on the Zhongshan warship to pursue the pirates towards Dapeng Bay. They departed early in the morning on the 13th (the pirates left the ship in the middle of the night on the 12th). At noon, they arrived at Dazhou Port. At that time, the pirates had already taken the loot ashore and were preparing to return to their nests. The navy spotted them and immediately pursued them closely. The bandits had no time to escape and engaged the navy in battle. Both sides opened fire for about an hour. Many bandits were killed, and a small number of bandits escaped over the mountains. Later, when the bandits ran out of ammunition, those who could not escape were captured by the navy, totaling eight people. Five hostages were rescued, and all the loot was recovered. Councilor Cai has now taken the eight captured pirates into the warship, together with the rescued hostages, and escorted them to Guangdong for interrogation of the location of the pirate's den, in order to completely eliminate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Chen Ce Telegraphed. Yesterday, Guangdong Fleet Commander Chen Ce telegraphed Shanghai to report the breaking of the case, saying: "Respected Mr. Li Zhongban, the Xinming steamer case has been handled by our fleet's Councilor Cai Tengfei, who supervised the special task force to pursue the bandits to the foot of Tianma Mountain in Dazhou Port on the first day of the new year and engaged them in a fierce battle. In addition to killing an uncounted number of bandits, eight bandits were captured on the spot, and five kidnapped guests and crew members, Chen Zhong, Wang Wu, and Zhang, were rescued. After this fierce suppression, it is thought that the Dapeng Bay pirates will not easily dare to harm travelers again. We still hope that you will pay attention to inspecting the private possession of military equipment on each ship to cut off the source of the bandits. Chen Ce's seal." Upon receiving the telegram, Mr. Li replied with a telegram of condolences, saying: "Respected Commander Chen of the Fourth Fleet, I have received your telegram with respect. The Xinming bandits have been captured, opening a new era of pacification, intimidating the bandits at sea, and demonstrating your determined command and effective leadership. In addition to informing the merchants who were in danger and instructing each ship to conduct strict inspections and provide strict protection in the future, I am sending a special telegram of thanks. I hope you will understand, respectfully, Li Zhonggong, Xiao."</p>
<p>Report to the National Government. Li Zhonggong reported to the National Government yesterday, saying: "Respected Chairman Jiang of the National Government, on the [unreadable character] day, the Xinming steamer was robbed and looted in Hong Kong Bay, and a large amount of goods was stolen, and four passengers and one staff member were kidnapped. I immediately telegraphed the Naval Department, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Fourth Fleet to dispatch warships to assist in the arrest and rescue of the hostages. I have now received a telegram from Commander Chen of the Fourth Fleet, which reads: (See the text of the telegram above). In addition to sending a telegram of thanks, I see that the naval officers and soldiers have given their lives, and all travelers are celebrating. I respectfully report this, and I respectfully request your consideration. Your subordinate, Li Zhonggong, Xiao."</p>
<p>Notice to Family Members. Yesterday, General Manager Li immediately sent Commander Chen's telegram to Shen Zhongyi, the head of the business section, to find out the Shanghai residences of the kidnapped passengers and crew members, record the telegram, and inform their families that the people had been rescued and were currently in Guangdong Province and would be sent back soon. He also telegraphed Commander Chen to inquire about the confessions of the captured bandits, trace the stolen goods, and request that troops be dispatched to the pirate's nest to thoroughly suppress them as a permanent solution, so that the voyage of South China sea liners would be free from the scourge of robbery forever.</p>
<h3>The Second General Meeting of the Two-Way Business Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>Passed 33 Cases from the Station Affairs and Transportation Group</p>
<p>The Three-Group Review Committee Continued to Hold Meetings in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Meeting Adjourned Today, Third General Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Second General Meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Two-Way Business Conference was held at the Jiande Savings Society from 9:20 a.m. yesterday. 146 representatives and experts from various places attended, and stationmasters related to the proposals were also present to explain the situation and express their opinions. Chairman Luo Panhui extended the meeting time, and it was not until 12:30 p.m. that the meeting adjourned. The unresolved cases were still referred to the Transportation, Station Affairs, and Cargo Review Committees for review. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Morning Session of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>After the chairman made an opening address and the ceremony was performed as usual, Chairman Luo Panhui first delivered a speech, mainly stating that the purpose of this meeting, from the perspective of the Railway Bureau, was to fully understand the misunderstandings between the Railway Bureau and merchants regarding commercial transportation. If there were any doubts or questions, all parties could raise their opinions for detailed discussion. On the part of the Railway Bureau, if they had the ability to handle matters, they would definitely put them into practice within a reasonable timeframe. However, for the sake of saving time and resources, he requested that discussions not stray beyond the scope of the proposals. As for the various proposals that failed to be resolved at the first general assembly the previous day, they had already been submitted to the three review committees. The reports from the review committees had already been received and submitted for discussion by the general assembly.</p>
<p>Discussion proceeded with a report by Cai Jijun, Deputy Director of the Document Group, on the resolutions of the first general assembly, which were approved by all without objection. Subsequently, Dai Linshu, Director of the Transportation Group's Review Committee, reported on the results of the group's review of the proposals, and it was decided by the assembly that each proposal would be passed through three readings. Regarding the discussion of the third, fourth, and fifth proposals, Mr. Li Jingwei, representative of the Railway Bureau, provided a detailed report on the Railway Bureau's increase in the purchase of vehicles. Among those already purchased, there were 100 forty-ton covered wagons, 65 of which had already left the factory, with the remainder being actively assembled. The Railway Bureau was planning to purchase 20 Jinghu Railway passenger locomotives, 15 freight locomotives, 100 passenger cars, and 300 freight cars, as well as lease 200 twenty-ton freight cars from an American vehicle company. The Huhangyong Railway planned to purchase 6 passenger locomotives, 7 freight locomotives, 24 passenger cars, and 200 forty-ton covered wagons. The 13th proposal, submitted by the Hangzhou Transfer Association, concerned the earlier arrival time of fresh produce cars. The 14th proposal, submitted by the Benniu Business Association, requested the extension of the Changhu Express train to pass the Benniu station. Due to the interests involved, they insisted on the proposal. Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department, expressed his sincere willingness to accept the proposal. Next, the Station Affairs Group's Review Committee reported the review results for discussion. Regarding the 131st proposal, the Railway Bureau reported that, due to the Great Shanghai Plan involving the Railway Bureau, it had previously sought the opinion of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, which advocated for a delay, so the entire plan needed to proceed together. However, during the discussion of the 132nd proposal, Liu Hongsheng's representative insisted on extending the Wusong freight station branch line, which the Railway Bureau accepted in part. During the discussion of the 183rd proposal, it was proposed and resolved to extend the time by 30 minutes. The group still had the 183rd and 184th proposals unresolved.</p>
<p>The chairman then announced the review report of the Freight and Other Group, which would be submitted for discussion at the general assembly on the 19th. The remaining proposals on the agenda for the day that had not been discussed were submitted to the three review committees for review, and then resubmitted to the general assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Various Proposals (1) Results of the Transportation Group's Review of the First Proposal: The first item was amended to read: "First, rebuild the Jinghu and Husu sections into double tracks. When funds are sufficient, rebuild the entire line into double tracks." The 14th proposal was amended to read: "The Railway Bureau should be requested to review and approve it. When revising the timetable, please extend the Changhu train to become a Changzhen intercity train." The remaining proposals were passed in their original form according to the review results. (2) Results of the Station Affairs Group's Review of the 132nd Proposal: Amended to read: "Regarding the issue of loading and unloading workers, it is heard that the Legislative Yuan is about to announce the Workers' Management Law. Once it is announced, it should be followed for reform. Before it is announced, please have the Railway Bureau properly formulate measures to supervise the workers to seek improvement. Regarding the issue of extending the freight station branch line and the wharf, it should be handled by the Railway and Road Engineering Department at its discretion." The 145th proposal was amended for the third time to read: "There is currently a shortage of vehicles, and stations are requesting them one after another. Therefore, empty cars are sent to other stations, which is the same for all stations, and there are also the same requests to keep cars at the station for loading. If this station handles it in this way, all stations will follow suit, which will greatly affect the entire line. When the number of vehicles increases in the future, it can be approved. However, please ask the Railway Bureau to pay attention and earnestly unblock the accumulated goods in the coal ports of the original stations." Also, the fifth item of the same proposal was amended to read: "The association should telegraph the National Government to order the troops stationed to quickly relocate." The results of the review of the 146th proposal were amended to read: "Since there is no car purchase matter for the Jinghu Hangzhou Railway, this proposal cannot be established. On the one hand, the Railway Bureau and the transportation industry can encourage each other and strictly adhere to professional ethics."</p>
<h3>Afternoon Review Committee</h3>
<p>Increased Review Committee Members: Chairman Luo Panhui of yesterday's general assembly announced at the opening of the meeting that the review committee members had been increased: Sun Choucheng and Shen Ruicheng for the Station Affairs Group; Feng Yunchu and Wang Xufu for the Freight and Other Group; Wang Jichun, Yang Guanqing, and Gui Yanfang for the Transportation Group.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Three Group Review Meeting: The three group review meetings were convened at the meeting place starting at 1:30 PM.

<h3>No Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Tea Party Success: The Railway Bureau held a tea party at the New Asia Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday to entertain the representatives. More than one hundred people attended. Zheng Baozhao and Hua Zejun presided over the party. Zheng and Hua delivered speeches one after another, and the guests and hosts parted happily around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Third General Assembly: The Railway Bureau, considering that today is Sunday, offered each representative a first-class complimentary ticket for round-trip travel for those who needed to leave Shanghai for sightseeing. These tickets were distributed to the representatives at yesterday's afternoon tea party, and they signed for them. Approximately forty people received tickets. The third general assembly will continue to be held at the Jiande Hall at 9:00 AM tomorrow, and it is scheduled that on the day of the closing ceremony, representatives from various regions will be invited to take a group photo again.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on Autonomous District Division</h3>
<p>General and Sub-District Maps Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Preparing for the Division of Neighborhoods and Villages for Defense</p>
<p>The Municipal Autonomous District Division Committee held its 15th meeting at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday. Chairman Xu Peihuang reported that the maps for the 40 districts had been drawn and sent to print, and the general map could also be completed within the month. The methods for dividing all neighborhoods and villages required the establishment of preparatory autonomous committees for supervision and review. Finally, it was resolved that: (1) the division of neighborhoods and villages should proceed from the bottom up, i.e., first neighborhoods, then villages, then districts; (2) the time limit was from February to June of this year; (3) a household register should be created for each district, with villages and neighborhoods attached; (4) the powers of the preparatory autonomous committees included recommending five drafters to draft regulations first; (5) the preparatory committee members would include two additional members appointed in Shanghai South and Zhabei, while other districts would be handled by the original district committee members, with additional municipal committee members appointed. Finally, it was declared that autonomous districts and land districts were two completely different concepts, as land districts were based on existing areas.</p>
<h3>Regulations on the Hiring and Firing of Shop Assistants After Year-End Account Closing</h3>
<p>Limited to Those Without Contracts</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued an instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In order to comply with the matter, the previous submission by the Chamber regarding the methods for year-end account closing in the Gregorian calendar has already been instructed and approved for record. Regarding the item on the hiring and firing of shop assistants, it should be limited to those without contractual provisions or customary constraints. Fearing that there may be some misunderstanding, this instruction is hereby reissued for your Chamber to comply with." This instruction.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Reorganization of the Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>Tax Revenue Unified to Eliminate Embezzlement</p>
<p>Simplified Procedures to Facilitate Merchants</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Tax Collected in Three Grades</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, since the Consolidated Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to prepare for the collection of the factory tax, it has been actively proceeding. In addition to the completed cases for cigarettes and wheat flour, which continue to be handled, the collection regulations for cotton yarn, matches, cement, etc., have been drafted. Once they are approved and promulgated by the National Government, they will be implemented on a scheduled basis. A reporter from the Daily News, in order to clarify the advantages of the consolidated tax reorganization, visited the local Consolidated Tax Department yesterday and was received by a Mr. from the Sixth and Second Sections, who shared the following: (1) Unify tax authority and eliminate embezzlement: China's tax system has always been complex. Most provinces govern themselves, with inconsistent legal systems. For any one item, from the starting point to the final destination, various taxes are often paid more than a dozen times. Not only do merchants feel pain, but it is also difficult for the rulers to achieve the effect of unified authority. Moreover, the abuses of embezzlement are everywhere. Over time, accumulated habits are difficult to reverse. If there is no major plan, it will be impossible to enrich the national treasury and relieve the people's difficulties. The urgent need to reorganize the consolidated tax is indeed due to this. (2) Simplify procedures and facilitate merchants: The consolidated tax legislation levies taxes at the factory. After one tax, it is valid indefinitely. Although inspection agencies are established at various key transportation points, they only inspect whether the cargo documents are consistent and immediately release the goods. There is absolutely no need to solicit petty fees. If goods are transported to provinces that have not yet implemented the consolidated tax, they are allowed to take the tax payment certificate to the original consolidated tax agency to refund the original amount of the collected factory consolidated tax. In short, the consolidated tax aims to centralize tax revenue and relieve merchants' difficulties. It truly intends to promote domestic products and recover leaks. Therefore, for consumables such as cigarettes, it does not hesitate to increase taxes again and again, embodying prohibition in taxation. For daily necessities, it tries to maintain them. Finally, the reporter met with a Mr. from the Fifth Section and inquired about the implementation date of the cotton yarn consolidated tax. He said that the regulations for the collection of the cotton yarn consolidated tax are still under review by the National Government. Once they are approved and promulgated, they will be implemented on a scheduled basis and will be announced. At present, cotton yarn in various regions can still be transported according to the old rules. In the future, the tax will be divided into three grades. The consolidated tax rates at all levels will be fair to avoid giving imported cloth the opportunity to repel domestic yarn or domestic cloth and other cotton products from the trade market. This point is most concerned by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Mint Officials Depart for the United States for Inspection</h3>
<p>Left Shanghai for the Province Yesterday</p>
<p>The Central Mint, directly under the Ministry of Finance, in order to improve minting work, adopt the latest world-style coinage, and innovate internal management, etc., Director Guo Biao specially appointed Huang Fuxiang, Zhong Wangrong, and Wen Zongyu, technicians of the factory, to go to the United States with Cliffard Hewitt, a foreign employee of the factory, to conduct on-site inspections of various minting situations in the U.S. Miut, the most famous mint in Philadelphia, in order to borrow experience for reform after returning to the country. The three technicians, Huang, Wen, and Zhong, along with the foreign employee Hewitt, have already set sail on the Da Lai wheel Madison yesterday and went to San Francisco to transfer to the province.</p>
<h3>The Realization of the Dredging of the Shentan Will Become a Reality</h3>
<p>Talks with the Inspector General of Customs</p>
<p>This reporter met with Mr. Mailer, the preparatory director general of the Inspectorate General of Customs, at the Inspectorate General of Customs the other day and talked about the dredging of the Shentan. Mr. Mailer said that his proposal had been adopted by the River Dredging Bureau, and the National Government had also gained considerable understanding of this. In the future, after the National Government approves it, a dredging ship will have to be built. The construction of this ship may take one or two years. However, the sooner the National Government passes it, the earlier all the opening procedures will be, and the faster the results will be achieved. It is reported that the proposal to dredge the Shentan occurred ten years ago. However, for ten years, the review has not been completed. Three years ago, Mr. Mailer was appointed as the Inspector General of Customs. Before leaving the position of Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, he submitted a proposal to the negotiator. What he proposed at that time was to deepen the Shentan so that it could accommodate ships with a draft of 33 feet. Now he feels that 33 feet is not enough, so it is necessary to make the port able to accommodate ships with a draft of 35 feet, so as to preserve the status of the Shanghai commercial port. Moreover, the national tax revenue depends on the prosperity of ships. If larger ships cannot directly enter Shanghai, the tax revenue will be affected. Therefore, although river dredging does not belong to the customs administration, from the perspective of tax revenue, we cannot but vigorously support it.</p>
<h3>Dr. Rajchman Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Strongly Praising the Effectiveness of Our Country's Recovery of Quarantine</p>
<p>Dr. L. Rajchman, Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations, was entrusted with an international health mission. He departed from Geneva last month, took the Siberian Railway to China, and first went to Harbin to meet Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Office. He did not meet him, so he went south at any time. He only passed through Beijing to Shanghai yesterday. As soon as his luggage was unloaded, he went to the National Seaport Quarantine Office at No. 2 Jiujiang Road to visit Dr. Wu and discussed Chinese health issues for a long time. The reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Dr. Rajchman at the Huizhong Hotel yesterday. The following is a record of his conversation: "Dr. La said that all careers are created by people, and the foundation of people lies in the body and spirit. Therefore, the issue of health is important. Nowadays, world transportation is convenient, and the spread and dissemination of diseases is even more worrying. Therefore, the issue of health cannot be regarded as a local issue. China has a vast territory and people from all countries gather here, and the number of Chinese people traveling abroad is also increasing day by day. I (La himself) was entrusted with the mission of international harmony and came to China to conduct inspections to report, and to consult with the Chinese health authorities and Dr. Wu Liande, who is internationally renowned for his health administration experience, on all health issues. The two most urgent issues internationally are border epidemic prevention and seaport quarantine. Dr. Wu previously handled epidemic prevention in the Northeast. The speed and impact of the effect were truly amazing. The international community was afraid that the Chinese government would neglect this important issue or even handle it poorly, causing international concerns. Therefore, it did not dare to entrust the heavy task of seaport quarantine to the Chinese. After seeing Dr. Wu's miraculous achievements in epidemic prevention, it congratulated China on having health talents. Now that the National Government has been established and a special department has been set up to handle health administration, it is indeed an urgent task. The international community is very happy that the seaport quarantine has been entrusted to Dr. Wu. Last year, China established the National Seaport Quarantine Office and completely took back the seaport quarantine power of China, which was originally managed by foreigners. The international community and I strongly supported it because of our belief in Dr. Wu. Shanghai Seaport is a world-recognized important port. Now that Dr. Wu is in charge, the effect has been much better than before in less than half a year. Now Xiamen Seaport has also been handed over and accepted. Consuls of various countries not only have no interjections, but also welcome it very much. In the future, the seaport quarantine power will soon be returned to China in order. I am entrusted with the lifeline of the international community and came to meet with Dr. Wu to discuss the future policy and plan of seaport quarantine, and to assist in the construction of Shanghai epidemic prevention hospitals and isolation facilities, etc., and to exchange international epidemic prevention experience and knowledge. I deeply hope that the international community and the great nation will prosper and coexist, and I wish China a bright future."</p>
<h3>The Headquarters of the First Fleet Moved to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Move into the Former Navy Compilation Office</p>
<p>After the Naval Compilation Office was abolished, all the remaining buildings and Shanghai-Hong Kong naval affairs were all managed by Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet. The First Fleet Headquarters in Fujian has arrived in Shanghai by the Vientiane wheel yesterday. At 8:00 AM, all personnel and furniture were moved to Gaochang Temple. Within two or three days, they will have to start working. Those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday included Chief Secretary Chen Shao-yi, Staff Officer Zheng Shi-zhang, Secretary Ye Geng-fu, Adjutant Peng Wei-ying, and more than 20 other people.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Weights and Measures Business Registration</h3>

<h3>The Provincial Shipping Industry Conference Discusses River Management Funds</h3>
<p>The shipping industries in various counties of Jiangsu Province held a meeting at the Shipping Industry Association in this port on the 14th to discuss the proposal by the Department of Construction to collect river management funds for small inland steamers. Representatives from various regions expressed practical opinions. The meeting continued on the afternoon of the 15th. Ding Mingzhong, a member of the Construction Department, also attended to state the purpose of the Construction Department's collection of these funds. The shipowners, due to the decline in the shipping industry in recent years, cannot afford any unexpected burdens, but in order to maintain the credibility of the official authorities, they have to respond slightly. After a long discussion, they agreed on six principles of consultation and appointed Li Yingnan of the Nanjing Shipping Industry Association, Qiao Nianchun of Shanghai, and Tao Xiubai of Zhenjiang as representatives to connect with the departments and provinces. The principles are recorded as follows: (1) The funds shall be designated for repairing and dredging rivers and shall not be used for other purposes, and the Department of Construction shall publish the river management plan. (2) The river management fee shall be 1.5%, which shall be borne by the shipowners and shall be implemented on a trial basis for one year. (3) The river management fee shall be collected on a monthly basis, and each ship bureau may submit the actual amount to be collected on a monthly basis to the local shipping industry association or chamber of commerce for transfer to the competent collection agency before the 15th of the following month. If there are investigations, etc., the competent agencies shall cooperate with the local shipping association or chamber of commerce. (4) Organize a River Management Fund Management Committee with the participation of shipowners. (5) When the ship company or ship bureau applies for a certificate from the ministry and a driving license, the Department of Construction should first order the county to notify the local shipping associations or chambers of commerce to investigate. If it is confirmed that there is a need to open or add a new route, and there is no conflict or division with the original route of the same industry, the association shall reply and obtain a certificate from two companies in the same industry before submitting it for review and approval. This method shall be submitted by the Department of Construction to the Ministry of Communications for approval. (6) The existing dredging and transportation funds collected in Nanjing and Zhenjiang shall be handled separately.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Disaster Relief in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Tragic Disaster in Ji'an and Taihe Counties</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Association and the Morality General Association jointly organized Jiangxi Relief. Zhang Xianqing and other 15 people in charge of relief departed on the Jiangshun wheel on the 15th. The association has also received a letter from the Jiangxi Fellows Disaster Relief Association in Yangzhou, which stated: "The disaster area in our province is vast, and the tragedy is especially severe in Ji'an and Taihe counties in western Jiangxi. Since the fall of Ji'an City, the tragedy of robbery and killing for more than 40 days has never been seen before. When the army arrived in Ji'an and recovered the city, the bandits retreated to Taihe, fortified themselves, and drove men, women, old and young from the four townships into the bandit dens to work together. When the villagers refused to comply, they were slaughtered without exception. When the army attacked Taihe and the bandits retreated to the Dongtai Mountains, they destroyed all the fields and houses, and even poisoned the wells and ponds, hoping to cut off the army's supply. No less than 100,000 people in Jiangxi Province have suffered. A total of 50,000 to 60,000 people have died in the two counties. Such cruelty is unheard of. Although the army has repeatedly won battles, the remnants of the year are covered with wind and snow, and the hungry and starved are everywhere. The survivors are waiting for the year of relief. It is true that the disaster in Jiangxi is so severe that it is probably no more than the two counties of Ji'an and Taihe. The noble association has always had the intention of giving generously and helping the masses, and the real survey of disasters has expanded the scope of good relations. Our association has obtained reports from various places that the two counties are the most severely affected and should be given urgent relief first to save the dying."</p>
<h3>Red Cross Society Establishes Relief Department</h3>
<p>Based on the suggestion of special member Wang Zhenchuan, the Chinese Red Cross Society stated that China has suffered repeated natural and man-made disasters in recent years. The extent and depth of the affected areas can be described as extreme. Even in Shanghai alone, every winter, countless poor people lack clothing and food. They cannot find a full meal during the day and have no shelter at night, often groaning and lying on the streets and alleys, with frequent cases of death from freezing. The southeast region, known for its wealth, and Shanghai, particularly prosperous, still sees such suffering among the helpless victims. The situation in the northwest provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan can only be imagined. Moved by what he has witnessed, and in accordance with the principles and general regulations, he suggests establishing a relief department to broadly raise funds and distribute them properly, ensuring that disaster victims receive tangible benefits, thereby enhancing the work of the Red Cross Society. The Red Cross Society, based on this, immediately submitted it to the 11th Standing Committee. The committee believes that the member's suggestions are highly relevant to the needs of the times. It should prepare to establish a relief department in accordance with the organizational law of the International Federation of Red Cross Societies and Article 4 of the association's general regulations, to handle all relief and aid matters.</p>
<h3>Women's Temperance Union Suggests Sheltering Beggars</h3>
<p>Letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association has always been committed to aiding beggars. Recognizing the large number of beggars in Shanghai, besides newly establishing shelters to collect beggars, and having already established the Women and Children's Education Institute to educate beggars, they sent a letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association yesterday, hoping to awaken the attention and cooperation of various authorities to complete the task of saving beggars as soon as possible. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, In the major trading ports of civilized countries, while there are the extremely poor who lack even a grain of rice and the extremely rich who possess millions, the streets are not filled with beggars in rags and emaciated faces, except for our Shanghai. Moreover, as winter approaches, these poor people suffer from hunger and cold, and their cries are everywhere. The inhumanity is extreme. Shanghai is also a place where Chinese and foreigners reside together, and the unsightly and pitiable begging of these compatriots, following behind foreigners, causes a loss of national dignity. Providing relief is not only the duty of compatriots but also a key task for the municipal government. Since the establishment of the municipal government in the Chinese territory of Shanghai, it has made many attempts to shelter these poor people. However, the authorities in the concessions, apart from expulsion, have taken no further action. Because there is no cooperation, the number of beggars in the bustling Shanghai has not decreased. Your esteemed association is a powerful organization in the concessions. We earnestly request you to make suggestions to the concession authorities, asking them to find ways to shelter the beggars and vagrants within the concessions as soon as possible. If this plan cannot be implemented immediately, we request them to cooperate with Chinese officials or private charitable organizations. We have long admired your association's enthusiasm for public welfare. We humbly request your consideration and adoption of this suggestion. Respectfully, [Association name]</p>

<h3>Supreme Court's Judgment on the Da Lun Case</h3>
<p>The Da Lun Real Estate Company at No. 404, the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, and twelve other businesses, including Lao Da Fang Tea Shop and Hua Ying Pharmacy, were involved in a lawsuit regarding the termination of their leases and the relocation of their premises. After the Shanghai Concession Court of Appeal rejected the second instance judgment on March 17, 1920, the Da Lun Company refused to accept the decision and appealed. The Second Civil Division of the Supreme Court heard the case and issued Judgment No. 2988 on November 28, 1920. The text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Main text) The original judgment regarding the rejection of the appellant's lawsuit against the appellees in the first instance and their associated costs is overturned and remanded to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. (Reasoning) According to Article 312, Paragraph 1 of the Revised Civil Procedure Law, "After the constraint of litigation occurs, even if the subject of the litigation is assigned or transferred, it is unrelated to the litigation." The term "unrelated to the litigation" refers to the fact that the plaintiff or defendant does not lose their qualification as a party due to the assignment or transfer of the subject of the litigation. In this case, regardless of whether the appellant sold the disputed house during the litigation, it remains a party to continue the litigation according to the aforementioned law. The appellees' claim that the appellant no longer has a right relationship, is not a subject of litigation, and that their appeal should be rejected, is a misunderstanding. Furthermore, according to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the same law, the term "involved in a lawsuit due to the relocation of houses" is limited to cases where there is no dispute over the lease between the owner and the tenant, and the lawsuit only arises from the relocation. If there is a dispute over the lease, it falls under the category of lawsuits involving lease rights and should be governed by Article 11 of the same law. Since the point of contention between the two parties is whether the lease should be terminated, it naturally does not fall within the scope of that article. The appellees' claim that this is a case of primary jurisdiction and that the appellant should not appeal to this court is also a misunderstanding. This will be clarified first. In this case, the appellant wants to take back the house rented to the appellees and rent it to the Da Zhonghua Department Store for renovation and business. The appellees are unwilling to relocate, leading to the lawsuit. After reviewing the case file, no written agreement was signed when the appellees leased the house, nor was a term agreed upon. The original trial court has legally determined that whether this lease can be terminated by the appellant at any time should be determined based on whether there is a custom in the area that favors the tenant, in accordance with Article 12 of the Implementation Law of the Debt Section of the Civil Code and Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. The appellees deny the termination of the lease and claim that the custom in Shanghai for leased houses is that tenants cannot be forced to relocate unless the landlord reclaims the property for their own use or the tenant is three months in arrears, or if the house is damaged and needs renovation, and that old tenants still have the right of first refusal after renovation. Although the Taxpaying Chinese Association has provided a letter as evidence, the letter from the association was requested by the appellees and does not cite any specific examples. It is questionable whether it can be adopted directly. The appellant has repeatedly stated that the architecture in the public concession has changed dramatically over the decades, and if there were such a custom, the original house could never be renovated. Recent examples include the Shenzhou Hotel, the Shanghai Stage, and the Sincere, Wing On, and New World companies, whose users are not the landlords, nor the original tenants in arrears, nor the original houses damaged and uninhabitable, and the renovated properties are not rented by the original tenants. This shows that the various claims of the appellees and the groups they requested to help are all unbelievable. Furthermore, more than a dozen replies from the Guang Zhao Association, De He Company, etc., were submitted in the case file. Without a thorough investigation, it is not possible to make an appropriate judgment. The original trial court ignored this and hastily relied on the letter from the Taxpaying Chinese Association to determine that Shanghai does indeed have this obvious and common custom, which is not sufficient to convince. As for the reply from the Shanghai Merchant Groups Reorganization Committee, which stated that there is no fixed custom in the city for landlords to reclaim and renovate indefinitely leased houses, it clearly contradicts the letter from the Taxpaying Chinese Association. If it is said that the reply from the committee is only an opinion discussed in a meeting and there are still doubts, in order to fulfill the duties of investigation, the original trial court should also entrust them to further investigate the facts of the customary practices in the Shanghai Concession over the years in order to be legal. The original trial court did not pay attention to detailed investigation and hastily used the words "the aforementioned custom is not absolutely denied" in the reply letter as the basis for adopting the letter from the Taxpaying Chinese Association, which is also inappropriate. Furthermore, the customs applicable to civil matters are limited to those that do not violate public order or good morals. Even if the custom claimed by the appellees is true, whether the point about renovation, as the appellant claimed, hinders the owner's plans for improvement and the economic circulation and development of the area, is related to the public interest, and it is necessary to review it. As for the tenant's side, at the beginning of the lease, since no term was agreed upon, the loss of small rent and renovation costs was not unforeseeable. The original trial court only relied on this to recognize the aforementioned custom as valid, disregarding the public interest, which is even more unsatisfactory. Furthermore, if a lease is set for a term of over twenty years, it should be shortened to sixty years in accordance with the provisions of Article 449 of the Civil Code. By analogy, if a custom that favors the tenant is applied to a lease with no fixed term, then in addition to giving the tenant a relocation period, it means acknowledging an unlimited lease if the landlord cannot claim termination without certain reasons. This is not the intention of the legislator. The original trial court did not see this and hastily rejected the appellant's lawsuit against the appellees in the first instance, which is even more inappropriate. The appellant's appeal cannot be said to be without reason. Based on the above conclusion, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 581, Paragraph 1, and Article 582 of the Revised Civil Procedure Law, as stated in the main text. November 28, 1920, Presiding Judge Huang Zhenpan, Judge He Wei, etc., of the Second Civil Division of the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Robbers Commit Daylight Robbery</h3>
<p>Jewelry Store Loses Over a Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Victim Reports to Police, but Police Ignore</p>
<p>Patrol Officer Chases Closely, Almost Shot</p>
<p>Robbers Escape into Crowd</p>
<p>At 12:15 PM yesterday, a brazen daylight robbery occurred at a jewelry store on Kaitai Road in the Public Concession. The robbers stole gold jewelry worth over 1,000 yuan, weighing ten taels, nine maces, and eight fen. The victim followed and reported to a nearby patrol officer, who ignored the report. The robbers fled into the Chinese territory, where a Chinese patrol officer joined the chase. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest and escaped without a trace. The detailed account of the incident is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Seven Robbers Arrive Suddenly at Noon. Qian Yating, a 47-year-old Ningbo native, has been running the Danfeng Jewelry Store at No. 169-170 North Xizang Road in the Public Concession for 19 years. His business has been good, attracting the attention of robbers. Yesterday, around 12:15 PM, Qian and six partners and apprentices were having lunch in the back of the store when seven robbers suddenly appeared: five wearing black long robes and woolen hats, and two wearing blue long robes and peaked caps. Two robbers stood at the door as lookouts, while the other five, each holding a handgun, rushed in. Under the pretext of buying a ring, two robbers stood on either side of the counter, one robber burst into the parlor, using his gun to frighten people into silence, and the remaining two robbers went around the parlor to the counter, pried open the screen window, and went directly into the inner room.</p>
<p>Report to Chinese Police Ineffective. After the two robbers entered the room, they ransacked the boxes and chests, robbing various finished gold jewelry, weighing ten taels, nine maces, and eight fen, worth over 1,000 yuan. They carried the stolen goods and fled out the door. After the robbers left the store, they acted calmly and unhurriedly, heading north together. The victim, Qian Yating, followed them closely. When the robbers reached the intersection of Kaifeng Road, they turned west into the Chinese territory. A Chinese patrol officer, No. 1254, stood there. Qian hurried forward to report, pointing out the robbers and asking the officer to sound the alarm and give chase. However, the officer first sized up Qian from head to toe and repeatedly shook his head, indicating that the matter was none of his business.</p>
<p>Patrol Officer Bravely Gives Chase. At this critical moment, the robbers had already entered Mongolia Road in the Chinese territory and were fleeing west. Seeing that the officer was unwilling to give chase, Qian had no choice but to follow westward. Just then, a police officer from the first precinct of the fourth district, No. 2348, stood at the entrance of the New Stage. Qian reported to the officer, who bravely stepped forward to give chase. However, the robbers crossed Xiaocaichang and turned north, entering Manchuria Road, about 200 meters away from the officer. A robber suddenly turned around and fired a shot, fortunately missing. The officer intended to return fire, but seeing the crowd of passersby, he was afraid of injuring innocent people, so he continued to follow closely. The robbers fled straight north along Manchuria Road, then turned east at Xinjiang Road, suddenly disappearing. The officer had no choice but to return to the station to report. The victim, Qian Zhiating, also returned to the intersection of Kaifeng Road to confront the Chinese patrol officer, No. 1254, asking why he did not chase the robbers when he saw them. The officer had no words to respond, repeatedly saying, "Please forgive me." Qian believed that the officer's failure to arrest the robbers was clearly a case of allowing them to escape, and he had no excuse. He accompanied the officer to the Haining Road Huishi Police Station to report. The police chief then sent the officer on duty, Ya Yonglu, to investigate, and then sent West Detective to further investigate everything.</p>
<p>Officer Witnesses Incident. Last night, Qian prepared a loss report and requested the police station to apprehend the robbers and recover the stolen goods. After learning of this incident, the reporter went to the scene to investigate. Nearby residents and shops were discussing the incident. The reporter visited the Public Security Bureau of the first precinct of the fourth district and learned that the fact that the robbers opened fire was indeed true. The officer who chased the robbers at the time was Xu Fuqing, post officer number three, whose duty time was from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM. According to the officer, around 12:20 PM, he saw the victim coming in a panic, telling him that the seven people walking in front were all robbers who had robbed his store of gold jewelry, and asking him to give chase. The officer immediately followed and chased, about 200 meters away from the robbers on Manchuria Road. At that time, one of the robbers suddenly turned around and fired a shot at the officer, fortunately missing. After the robber opened fire, they mixed into the crowd and disappeared without a trace. He also said that the robbers had robbed the store in the concession before fleeing into the Chinese territory, but at that time, he did not hear the concession police blow the whistle, nor did he see the police chase after them.</p>
<h3>Xinzhuang Has Resumed Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>The strike in Xinzhuang Town, west of Shanghai, caused by the extortion of tea donations, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the cause of the strike was that the Fourth District Office had a proposal to increase the police station donation due to insufficient funds. Merchants felt that the market was sluggish and that they could not bear the usual donations and taxes. Seeing that there was extortion of tea donations, which even led to tea houses closing and striking, they felt that everyone was in danger, which aroused public anger, and the whole town went on strike. The Chamber of Commerce immediately convened an emergency meeting, and standing committee member Qian Jizhang and others earnestly advised the shops to resume business. On one hand, the Chamber of Commerce also issued a notice to resume business and wait for the county government to resolve the matter. The whole town reopened for business at around 8:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>A letter from the Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce said: "Dear Editor, In today's local news column of your newspaper, there is a report about the strike in Xinzhuang Town. The reason for the strike was that Zhu Wen, the head of the Fourth District, acted rashly and aroused public anger. Fortunately, the patrol officer of the Public Security Branch Office took appropriate measures and did not cause a major disaster. Our Chamber of Commerce has been working hard to mediate, and all businesses have resumed business today. As for the fact that the Tongkang Pawnshop was also among the shops on strike, it is not true. We are issuing a joint statement requesting a correction. Sincerely, Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce, January 17th."</p>
<h3>Shandong Bandit Leader Executed by Firing Squad in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Does Everything: Murder and Arson</p>
<p>Trembles and Voice Shakes Before Execution</p>
<p>Hu Xiaozhong, a 32-year-old Shandong bandit leader from Yanzhou, Linyi, was originally a local rogue. Later, he joined a bandit gang and led hundreds of bandits to attack several villages in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, killing more than a dozen people and burning dozens of homes. At the same time, he also killed his maternal aunt's daughter when he tried to force her to marry him unsuccessfully. His crimes were heinous. Later, he was severely suppressed by government troops and could not gain a foothold, so he fled to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he encountered the victims Chen Qingnian and Chen Chou in west Shanghai. He was brought to the police station and handed over to the Public Security Bureau. He was then handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. As a result, since the crime took place in Shandong, a letter was sent to Shandong requesting extradition. This did not happen between July and August because of the war. The victim traveled thousands of miles to the county government in his hometown to obtain a certificate. Later, the headquarters returned it to the Public Security Bureau and transferred it to the local court for investigation. The court filed a public prosecution under the Law on the Punishment of Bandits. After a public trial, and with the testimony of his maternal uncle who came to Shanghai from his hometown, he was sentenced to death. The verdict was submitted to the higher authorities for approval and was executed by firing squad yesterday at 3:00 PM. After the court's prosecutor's office received notification from the criminal court, he ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and supervising execution officers Gu Hanqing, Xue Bingzhang, Cai Zuoqing, Wang Jianqing, Xu Guoguang, and ten others to take the Hu suspect from the detention center, put him in a car, and go directly to the Caohejing execution ground. The executive prosecutor Yang Qi and clerk Li Dingfan arrived at the scene, took their seats, and questioned Hu, who requested to send a letter to his uncle, Hu Laosan, at the Xujiahui factory to collect the body. His voice was trembling, his feet were unstable, and he was terrified. The official ordered the execution, and Police Chief Yang immediately directed the bailiffs to carry out the firing squad execution and announced the crimes so that the public would know.</p>
<h3>Selling Passports to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Two or Thirty Found</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau recently received a tip-off that a man named Wu from Qingtian was selling passports for business abroad in his Qingtian stone shop next to the Xiaoshijie on Fuyou Road in the city. However, the passports were all single sheets obtained from consulates in Singapore, Penang, and other places and were not official passports. They were all cases of impersonation. The Public Security Bureau sent detectives to arrest him, but Wu was away on business. The detectives arrested two small peddlers and merchants from Zhejiang who had already bought passports from Wu and wanted to go to France to travel. The shipping company did not sell them tickets, so they contacted Wu. The detectives searched Wu's room and found about 20 or 30 unofficial passports of the kind mentioned above, and brought them all to the bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3>Hongfa Sandboat Encountered Pirates in a Blizzard</h3>
<p>All Property Was Robbed</p>
<p>Nine Boat Crew Froze to Death</p>
<p>The North Port sandboat, named Hongfa, was sailing from Jiaozhou, Shandong, carrying over a thousand salted pigs and three thousand heads of Jiaozhou cabbage, bound for Shanghai, consigned to Hengda and other firms for sale. On the 11th of this month, while sailing in the northeastern waters off Fushan, it encountered a storm and snow, with extreme cold. The crew members found it difficult to work on deck. The boat owner, Mr. Jiang, seeing this situation, ordered the helmsman to steer towards the coast to seek shelter from the wind. However, the storm intensified, with waves crashing over the deck. Two crew members working at the bow were swept away by the waves. The boat owner, panicked, was then faced with the breaking of the two masts, causing loss of steering capability. The crew members were helpless and had to let the boat drift with the wind, which eventually pushed it to the foot of a mountain on the coast, where the boat capsized and lay diagonally stuck. The boat owner and crew members climbed to the foot of the mountain and sounded gongs for help. For two days and nights, no ship passed to rescue them. Due to the extreme cold, seven or eight crew members froze to death at the foot of the mountain. Suddenly, pirates spotted them, sailing two pirate ships to loot the boat. They robbed all the salted pigs and Jiaozhou cabbage. Still unsatisfied, they also stole the crew's boxes, bedding,</p>

<p>ginger, and luggage. Later, a Ningbo fishing boat passed by and anchored nearby. The boat owner asked for help, explaining the situation of encountering the storm and robbery. The fishing boat took the boat owner and others to Taicang to disembark. Of the total of eighteen crew members, eight or nine were either lost at sea in the storm or frozen to death on the mountain. The rescued crew members are now on the boat in Taicang. Yesterday, the boat sent a crew member to Shanghai to report to the firm. Upon receiving the report, the firm sent a representative, hired a boat, and purchased several coffins and burial wood to head to the scene of the incident to collect the bodies of the frozen crew members and to inspect the damage to the boat in order to tow it back to Shanghai for repairs.</p>

<p>The Gonghe steamer, owned by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which sails between Shanghai and Hankou, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th of this month after sailing from Hankou. However, when it sailed from Shanghai to Hankou on the 5th of this month, it was originally scheduled to arrive in Hankou on the 10th, but due to the extremely cold weather, it was delayed along the way and did not arrive until the afternoon of the 11th. Therefore, its arrival in Shanghai was also delayed by one day, only arriving at the Zhuangyuan Wharf in Hongkou at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 16th). When the steamer set sail from Hankou, the Shanghai Maritime Customs received a tip-off that the steamer was secretly carrying a large quantity of opium to Shanghai and requested special attention. Therefore, as soon as the steamer docked, the Customs immediately dispatched more than ten Chinese and foreign customs officers to search the ship. After a thorough search that lasted until about 6:00 AM yesterday morning, they finally discovered a hidden compartment containing a large quantity of opium, amounting to dozens of dan. It is said that the value is approximately between 40,000 and 50,000 gold. After the seizure, the customs officers transported the opium one by one onto the customs boat, fully loaded, and left.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan opened the court session. The defendant, Hu Shaogong, did not attend, but was represented by lawyer Zhan Jifeng. First, Lu Yifang stated that the defendant had stated in court that I had gone to his home twice to extort money, which was published in the newspaper, causing great damage to my reputation, so I filed a lawsuit. Then, lawyer Zhan stated that the defendant did not dispute the facts and began the defense. Lawyers Zhang Chongding and Huang Jue spoke first, arguing that defamation and extortion were two separate matters. Hu Die wanted to increase Lu's guilt, so he added extortion as a premise. The defendant then spoke without restraint in front of a large audience, causing great damage to the plaintiff's reputation. Therefore, after the verdict in this case, it is still necessary to request that the judgment be published in the newspaper in order to restore his reputation. Then, lawyer Zhan replied. After the debate, Judge Ge asked the plaintiff if he could reconcile and whether he would be satisfied with an apology. Lu requested that the case be handled according to the law. Judge Ge then stood up and announced the verdict: the defendant, Hu Shaogong, was not guilty. Lu stated that he was not satisfied with the verdict in this case. Judge Ge then advised him that accepting the judgment did not prevent him from appealing. The court then continued to hear other cases, and the audience in this case dispersed like a receding tide.</p>

The police officers chased after her and were assaulted by Xu in collusion with his colleagues Li Jinlin, Qin Zanting, and Wu Maomao. When the police station heard the alarm, they dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Xu and others and took them to the Special District Local Court. It was learned that Chinese police officer No. 2708 was more seriously injured and was being treated in the hospital. The defendants were ordered to be detained pending further questioning, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued.

Then, the wife of the Englishman residing in the house testified, stating that she was upstairs when the incident started, and when she heard the alarm and came downstairs, she saw Chinese police officer No. 2708 holding a pistol and threatening to shoot the defendants. She also saw that Li Jinlin's hands were red and swollen, and Qin and Wu also had injuries. Xu Shengtin had a bleeding eye. She then ordered everyone to knock down the Chinese police officer, who was acting like a madman, and she took away his pistol. She wanted to report to the police station, but it was too far away. As for Chinese police officer No. 1086, he had already escaped through the window when she was not downstairs. The defendants jointly retained lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them.

<p>I have read the news column in your esteemed newspaper on the 17th of this month regarding the Commercial Press's Translation Bureau's opposition to the new standards. It stated that, when I participated as a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, I said, "These new standards are brought from capitalist countries in the West. Whether they can be applied to a country practicing the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People is yet to be studied." This is a simplified version that misrepresents my original intent.</p>
<p>In fact, what I said that day was roughly that European and American countries are capitalist countries, while China is a country implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Although both strive for production, their goals are different. The principles of scientific management practiced in Europe and America are good, but their methods may be biased toward the interests of capitalists due to differing positions. Applying them wholesale to China, which practices the Principle of People's Livelihood, requires further study.</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned that readers may misunderstand, so I am writing this letter to clarify. I hope you will publish the original letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xu Zhi</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Central Government to Explain Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to its subordinate units to explain the Central Training Department's methods for interpreting laws and regulations. The original order stated: "Regarding the Administrative Yuan's Order No. 102, and the National Government's Order No. 1, upon reviewing the Central Training Department's letter: 'It has been found that when local party branches and people's organizations request explanations of laws and regulations promulgated by the Central Government and its subordinate departments, they often submit requests to both this department and the relevant government departments for the same law. If a unified method is not established, the interpretations of the party and government may not always be consistent, which may lead to misunderstandings and hinder the implementation of laws. Therefore, this department has formulated three methods for interpreting laws and regulations for careful consideration. These were sent to the Central Secretariat for review and approval by the Standing Committee as proposed. Accordingly, the original proposed methods are enclosed for your reference and for informing your subordinates.' Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders, the original methods are copied and sent to you for your information and for informing your subordinates." A copy of the original methods for interpreting laws and regulations is enclosed.</p>
<p>Central Training Department's Methods for Interpreting Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>1.  All requests to this department for explanations of laws and regulations related to training promulgated by the National Government and its subordinate departments, ministries, and committees shall be forwarded by this department to the National Government for submission to the Judicial Yuan or the competent government department for explanation.</p>
<p>2.  All requests to this department for explanations of laws and regulations related to training promulgated by the Central Government may be interpreted by this department or submitted to the Central Executive Committee for explanation.</p>
<p>3.  All requests to this department for explanations of laws and regulations promulgated by this department shall be interpreted by this department.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Promote People's Schools</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to all provinces and cities to submit, within one month, their proposed plans for the 19th year to promote people's schools, as well as the plans of their subordinate cities and counties. The order stated: "People's schools in all provinces and cities urgently need to be actively promoted. In January of the 19th year, Order No. 19 of this ministry was issued, ordering the drafting and submission of this year's promotion plans. One year has now passed. Many have complied with the order and submitted reports, but many have not yet done so. It must be understood that the success of education depends on design. Without a clear plan, how can progress be promoted and success achieved? Now that the second semester of the 19th year is about to begin, the aforementioned plans for this year for each province, city, and its subordinate cities and counties should have been completed. You are ordered to submit the proposed plans and the promotion plans of your subordinate cities and counties within one month of receiving this document, for evaluation. Do not delay any further. This order is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Denies Qualifications of Graduates from Unregistered Private Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Jiangsu Education Department regarding Wu Bingjun, the former principal of Nanyang Public School, requesting recognition of the qualifications of the school's graduates (Zhang Zhengxian and 11 others from the Commerce Department who graduated in July of the 5th year of the Republic, He Peiyuan and 27 others from the Commercial Department, and Zhao Yunshang and 27 others from the Banking Department who graduated in July of the 6th year of the Republic), instructed the Jiangsu Education Department: "The report has been noted. The methods for recognition stipulated in this ministry's Announcement No. 8 of this year refer to graduates of private schools that have been approved and registered by this ministry and the former University Council, as well as students who entered and studied at those schools before registration. The period during which this ministry recognizes schools registered with the former Beijing Ministry of Education is also clearly stipulated in Announcement No. 9 of this year. Since the school was discontinued in the 8th year of the Republic and was not approved for registration by the former Beijing Ministry of Education, there is no basis for recognition. As for relief methods, in August of this year, this ministry held a qualification examination for graduates and students of unregistered and closed private colleges and universities in Shanghai. According to Article 7 of the examination regulations: 'Graduates with excellent results may transfer to the final year of public or registered private colleges and universities when they are recruiting students (this is the result of the qualification examination, and the Ministry of Education has ordered public and registered private colleges and universities to be accommodating and not be restricted by Article 4 of the University Regulations and Article 4 of the College Regulations). Other graduates and students will transfer to the corresponding grade according to their level.' In the future, if necessary, this ministry may hold another such examination. If the original qualifications of these students meet the requirements of Article 1 of the examination regulations, they should be allowed to take the examination at that time to provide relief."</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Requests National Games to Move to Shenyang</h3>
<p>Hearing that the Construction of Venue in Beijing Will Take Time</p>
<p>Has Telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang to Discuss with Central Government</p>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) This year's National Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing. The main venue has already begun construction. The rules of the games have been drawn up, and the Organizing Committee of the Games has convened a meeting of the Advisory Committee. Professor Hao Gengsheng of Northeastern University, one of the advisory committee members, received a telegram before the New Year stating, "Construction of the venue has begun. The rules of the games urgently need to be determined. A meeting of the Advisory Committee will be held at the Mausoleum Park on the afternoon of January 5th next year. Please come to Beijing to attend. The Organizing Committee of the National Games." Mr. Hao traveled south to Beijing a few days ago. According to news from the education community, Wang Huayi, President of the Liaoning Provincial Education Association, inquired with relevant parties in Nanjing about whether the venue could be completed on time. He received a reply stating that the venue was contracted to the Nanjing Liyuan Construction Company, with a construction cost of 849,000 yuan and a completion period of 300 days. Based on the current start date, it would not be completed until the end of this year. Therefore, it is speculated that the National Games cannot be held in Beijing this year. When Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang entered Beijing before the New Year and met with Commander-in-Chief Chiang, he discussed this matter and feared that the construction of the venue would not be completed in time, causing the competition to be delayed. Chiang said that if the venue could not be completed on time, the games would be held in Shenyang instead. Zhang expressed his agreement at the time. Now, various schools in Shenyang are extremely happy and hope that the National Games will be moved to Shenyang. The public is urging Wang Huayi, President of the Provincial Education Association, to negotiate with the National Games to move the games to Shenyang. Mr. Wang convened a meeting of the Sports Promotion Association on the 11th to discuss detailed plans. After the meeting, it was decided to telegraph Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang to request the Central Government to move this year's National Games to Shenyang.</p>

The teachers and staff of each school have also worked hard to produce items, making this a truly commendable achievement.</p>

<h3>Southeast Women's Physical Education School Plans to Build Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The private Southeast Women's Physical Education School on Beile Road in the French Concession, founded by Yu Ziyu and Qin Xingshi, has been operating diligently for seven years. Graduates from each class have served society and contributed significantly. Recently, due to the large number of students, the original rented school building was no longer able to accommodate them. Moreover, they felt that the facilities of national physical education schools were incomplete. Therefore, last autumn, they sought a large amount of money and bought land across from Fudan University on Xiangyin Road in Jiangwan to build school buildings. At the same time, they are also planning to build a gymnasium. However, a large amount of money is needed, and the two founders found that their personal capabilities were weak and it was not easy to undertake this task. Therefore, they informed the graduates serving at home and abroad to share the responsibility. Now, they have received replies from the graduates, who are willing to take on the task of fundraising for the construction of the gymnasium. It is heard that the school's construction plan is divided into five parts: the male teachers' and staff's dormitories and offices, the classrooms, and the student dormitories, which are divided into east and west sections. The funding for these four parts of the construction is entirely borne by the two founders with their own funds. The gymnasium, on the other hand, will be funded by donations from the school's graduates. Teachers and students will work together to achieve this great ambition. It is now heard that they have hired engineers to draw up complete architectural drawings and invite contractors to bid for the construction project. As soon as the bidding procedures are completed, they will start construction with skilled workers and materials.</p>

<h3>West Green Girls' Basketball Team Overwhelmingly Defeats East Light</h3>
<p>The result was a victory by thirty-five to five.</p>
<p>West Green defeated Pei Cheng by fifty-nine to three.</p>
<p>The West Green Women's Basketball Tournament has five participating teams, three of which are Chinese: Two Rivers, East Light, and Pei Cheng. Yesterday, there were two matches, both of which were one-sided. The difference in skill was significant, resulting in vastly different scores. Two Rivers defeated East Light by thirty-five to five, with Gray Tuoma as the referee. West Green defeated Pei Cheng by fifty-nine to three, with Shao Ji as the referee.</p>
<h3>Two Rivers Gains Advantage with Pure Skill</h3>
<p>Since sweeping the north, Two Rivers has been praised throughout Shanghai. The team members have been together for years, and their advances and retreats are well-coordinated. They are agile and nimble. There's nothing more to be said. East Light has many talented players, but as the team was recently formed, they were unable to demonstrate their strengths, resulting in a major defeat in their debut. If they are given time and practice diligently, they may become a strong and brave team in the future. At the start of the match, Two Rivers advanced aggressively. Yang Ren scored the first point. East Light countered, and Wu Peihua tied the score. Subsequently, Two Rivers relied on their ingenious teamwork to penetrate the enemy lines with ease. At that time, East Light defended effectively, and although their basket was repeatedly targeted, they did not suffer a complete defeat. In the first quarter, Two Rivers scored ten points, and East Light scored two points. In the second quarter, Two Rivers still had the upper hand but not as much as in the first quarter. In this quarter, Two Rivers scored five points, and East Light scored two points. In the last two quarters, Two Rivers played with increasing energy, while East Light had little room for activity, except for one free throw in the third quarter. The final score was thirty-five to five, with Two Rivers winning.</p>

However, due to the time difference, if it is not possible to broadcast each victory or defeat immediately, the results of the entire day will be compiled and broadcast.

<h3>After Death and Before Life of Mr. Liu Rongtai</h3>
<p>Written by Liu Henwo from Bengbu</p>
<p>Liu Rongtai, the captain of the Zhabei Section 3 Fire Brigade, reportedly died on the night of the 9th of this month at approximately 10 PM while rushing to a fire alarm.</p>
<p>He died in the line of duty. I was shocked and saddened to hear about the death of Mr. Liu, whom I had known for a long time. Recently, I have been assisting the government in northern Anhui. I am far away and thousands of miles away, so I will record some old events as a way to pay my respects.</p>
<p>I remember meeting Mr. Liu in the summer of 1927. The story of how we met was quite unique. I was young and unrestrained, and I indulged in romance. I was in love with a wandering woman named Jin Yu Wu Niang. Unexpectedly, she was also an old acquaintance of Mr. Liu. When I heard about it, I gave way out of love. Later, through the introduction of a "slim-waisted" man, we hit it off immediately and became close friends. We occasionally talked about the past and looked at each other in silence. Now that Mr. Liu has passed away, I am saddened by the loss of a good friend. Jin Yu is a woman with a thin life, and her whereabouts are unknown. I have also experienced the joys of the pleasure quarter and have long given up on romantic thoughts. Looking back on the past, it feels like a dream.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu was gentle and never spoke harshly. Therefore, new and old friends enjoyed socializing with him. At the end of the year, friends gathered. He rented a room at the New New Hotel as a place for rest and recreation. Mr. Liu was working as a special agent in the Old Gate Police Department of the Public Concession. We spent our days and nights together, partying and sharing our experiences. He often confided that this career was prone to resentment and not what he wanted. I was just</p>
<h3>Mr. Mao Junhe Ting Invited Me to Visit Runzhou Helin</h3>
<p>I visited Helin and Zhaoyin Bamboo Forest in Runzhou with Yi Ru and wrote a letter to Zhan Tang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Mojun</p>
<p>How many times have I been to Jinjiao in my life? This is the first time I have enjoyed a pleasant trip to the southern suburbs. Mr. Shuihuiyuan is an old poet. He has repeatedly invited me to visit by letter. Lord Hu's poems embrace a confident and unrestrained spirit. Therefore, he left behind wonderful lines to be admired again and again. (Mr. Zhandang initially planned to travel together, but it didn't work out.) Braving the cold, I rowed a boat and called out to talented friends. The fallen leaves of the Yangtze River were rustling. The millstone stands tall and majestic like a yellow crane. Countless peaks vie to come to court. After the rain, the lake is as smooth as a dragon's eye. The clouds are across the ridge, recognizing the bee's waist. The spring hugs the ridge and refuses to come out, subtly floating flower petals to the　　. The ancient cold is poured into the empty Qin pool. I can imagine the solitary beauty floating in the lotus pond. (Dragon Eye Lake Bee Waist Ridge is located between the two mountains of Millstone and Yellow Crane. The Jinu Spring comes out from the right of the ridge, and the Lianxi Temple is located there. There is a White Lotus Pond in front of the temple and a Floating Flower Pavilion behind it. Qin Pool) The gurgling sound echoes for ten miles, and my poetic heart flies to the distant Yao heaven. There is no road in the depths of Yao heaven. Suddenly, there is an ancient temple supporting the towering sky. The frost chimes are clear and round, passing through the desolate expanse. I slightly indulged in the peaceful and joyful breeze. The old monk spoke of the party's robbery for no reason. I heard that two cranes had withered one after another. At the end of the year, I wept as a tired traveler at the end of the world. Alas, the souls of the immortal birds cannot be summoned. (The owner of Heting once released two cranes at Helin Temple. The cranes were harmed by the troops stationed at the temple. The owner grieved and wrote poems to mourn them.) People are like morning dew, and what can be said about things? Try to understand emptiness and head towards emptiness. I looked out over this leisure spot at Yuting Pavilion, and the great river crashed against the shore, startling the waves. With such rivers and mountains, it is good to have fun. Would you be willing to let the sun and moon come to torment you? The secluded and remote number invites　. One Miao still transcends all things. White clouds are always good companions for reading, and the greenery of the Six Dynasties is across the eyebrows. (Yurui Pavilion is located on Baiyun Ridge, where Liang Zhaoming has a reading platform with excellent scenery) Remember to bring a jug of wine in the spring and listen to the yellow crane sing. (In the mountains in spring, yellow cranes fly around, and their clear voices are pleasing to the ear.) If this person and this place do not return to seclusion, they will surely be mocked by the mountain spirits for thousands of years. Let's plant ten thousand pine trees together and lie down in the river and sky. The blue dragon roars.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I heard that Wei Qi had resigned from his position. One evening, he came to visit me suddenly. We shook hands and reminisced about the past. I learned that he was in charge of the affairs of the Third Section Fire Brigade and was engaged in public welfare. At that time, the brigade had been destroyed by artillery fire in the Qi-Lu battle. Fortunately, Mr. Liu managed the affairs diligently and restored the old appearance. We were expecting to serve the local area and rely on peace, but unexpectedly, this person was struck by disaster. The heavens are vast, but how cruel are they?</p>
<p>Mr. Liu was generous and righteous and did not engage in production. He spent all the money he earned. Therefore, his income was only enough to cover his expenses, and he had no savings. But he died. The situation is desolate. He left behind a wife, concubine, and young children. The dead are gone, but what about the living? As I write this, I am overwhelmed with sorrow.</p>
<h3>A Visit with Yang Xiaolou in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Mei Hua Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou, Xin Yanqiu, and others arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 14th. Upon hearing the news, I immediately visited Xiaolou at the Great China Hotel. Xiaolou's demeanor was the same as before, but his cheeks showed signs of travel fatigue. It is understandable that those who are not used to long journeys would feel tired. When Xiaolou saw me, he shook hands and welcomed me. After exchanging pleasantries, he narrated his situation after our separation. When he talked about the rebellious act of his son, Ling Zikeming, a look of displeasure appeared on his face. I was afraid that he would be too saddened, so I quickly changed the subject. Xiaolou said, "After we parted in Ping'an before New Year's Eve the year before last, I was worried about my health and was bedridden for three months before I recovered. During these three months, I was accompanied by medicine stoves and teapots every day, and I felt very painful in my mind. Fortunately, thanks to the blessing of heaven, I gradually recovered after three months. However, after this illness, my body is not as strong as before. In the second half of the year, my rebellious son, Zikeming, did not behave himself and repeatedly caused trouble, which caused me all kinds of embarrassment. This spring, I had many illnesses again, sometimes sick and sometimes recovered, which made me feel very unhappy. The summer in Beiping was hotter than ever before. I took the name of offering incense and went to Lianhua Mountain to escape the heat. I didn't return to Ping'an until the autumn was cool. After this long period of recuperation, my humble body finally recovered. I performed in Ping'an and Tianjin, and I felt much better. This time I came to Shanghai, I didn't intend to do so. I was sincerely invited by the Great Stage and enthusiastically encouraged by my relatives and friends, so I made this trip today. However, since I returned to the north in 1934, it has been ten years. I am unfamiliar with the old friends in Shanghai. This time I came back, I may have been negligent or careless with some old friends. I hope that my old friends will understand and forgive me. If you don't mind my humble abilities, please give me guidance from time to time and correct my shortcomings. Then I will be greatly grateful."</p>
<p>Those who came with Xiaolou included Chuan Xiaoshan, Liu Yanting, and Liu Fang. Yang's family and his nephew Liu Zongyang also came along. Zongyang is the son of Yanfang and sings martial old men. He follows Xiaolou as his model. He enjoyed great fame at the age of eleven and was known as the Little Monster in Ping'an. This time he came south entirely for leisure and did not perform on stage.</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu also stayed at the Great China Hotel and arrived in Shanghai with Xiaolou in the same car. After arriving, he went to the newspaper office to visit his godfather, Lin Wushan. People praised his filial piety. Ma Lianliang did not return to Ping'an. The rumors that he returned to the north to invite actors were false.</p>
<p>Yang and the others are staying at the Great China Hotel temporarily. After Mei Lanfang, Tan Fuying, and others leave Shanghai, Yang and the others will move into a new house on Julida Road. The date of Mei and Tan's return to the north is probably around the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Epitaph for Mr. Wu Changshuo of Anji</h3>
<p>— Feng Junmu</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Junqing, styled Changshuo, was also known by his style in his later years. He was from the Wu family of Anji, who lived in Zhangwu Village west of the county. In the Hongzhi era of the Ming Dynasty, Xiaofeng County was established. The village belonged to Xiaofeng, but the registry remained the same. They had a reputation for learning and virtue, as recorded in the family history. During the troubles of the Cantonese bandits, the entire village of Zhangwu was slaughtered. His grandmother Yan, mother Wan, engaged wife Yang, and his younger siblings were all killed. The Wu family was almost wiped out. Just before the county was about to be occupied, Mr. Wu followed his father in fleeing, suffering from hunger in the poor valleys. Fortunately, they escaped death. After the rebellion was settled, he became a student and mourned the family disaster, feeling as if he was still in mourning. His desire for worldly pursuits was almost extinguished. He was unsuccessful in his middle age and could not support himself due to poverty. He reluctantly tried to become an official in Jiangsu. After accumulating hard work, he was promoted to the position of Zhili Zhou Zhizhou. He served as the magistrate of Andong for a month before resigning. He gave up his position and traces, and from then on, he was far away from officialdom. He had a long-standing interest in literature and art and was also skilled in seal carving. He delved into the inscriptions on Pan Meng Ding and steles, pursuing and refining them. He moved freely and merged with the Qin and Han dynasties. He treated rare ancient texts and small stones as treasures, equal to jade. Mr. Wu's calligraphy was solemn and dignified. He was well-versed in oracle bone script, seal script, clerical script, and cursive script. Mr. Wu's paintings were obscure and unpredictable, opening up unique corners. He had thousands of changes and no traces to follow. After returning to his original state, he wandered around Wu and Yue. Those who brought gold to seek his works gathered. He established clear rules and took righteousness without shame. He supported his relatives and friends. After the age of seventy, his fame grew. Japanese scholars admired his talent and character. They built the Golden Ship Xiangkan for him and placed it at the foot of Gushan Mountain in West Lake. Those who passed by admired it and added to the historical facts. Mr. Wu was generous in character and did not possess anything. He was humble and had no grievances with others. Since the change of the country, he has retreated and avoided the world. He only interacted with wandering people and old villagers. He rarely spoke about the rise and fall of politics. He became deaf in his later years and enjoyed seclusion. Although he was in the company of guests, he was a little out of touch, but his expression was calm and unfathomable. He expressed his life's emotions in poetry. He searched deeply and created alone, penetrating into its obstacles. In his later years, he thought even harder. He carefully considered every word and phrase, often until dawn. When his family slightly stopped him, he said, "It's not suppressed and regurgitated. I'm dredging out what I can't stand. Why do you say it's bitter?" He died at his residence in Shanghai on the sixth day of the eleventh month of the Dingmao year at the age of eighty-four. As soon as the news of his death spread, people far and wide mourned him. His disciples consulted with each other on the rituals and posthumously named him Mr. Zhenyi. He embraced his talents and principles, and his hearse was carried far away. Was it not wise to honor his virtue and commend his actions? His poems, songs, prefaces, and postscripts were compiled into ten volumes of the Canlu Poetry and □ volumes of the Outer Collection. His great-grandfather was Fang Nan, a student of the Imperial College. His grandfather was Yuan, a Juren and a teacher in Haiyan. His father was Xin Jia, a Juren selected as a county magistrate. His wife was Lady Shi, who was simple and unadorned and had lofty aspirations. They shared a common interest in epigraphy and worked hard together. They were a good match and their love did not change in their old age. She died ten years earlier. He had three sons: Yu, Shang, and Han, who was adopted by his father. He had one daughter, who married Qiu Peihan of Wucheng. Several months before his death, Mr. Wu visited Tangxi Chaoshan. This place had the legacy of Tang Yuqian, who lived in seclusion in the mountains and drank from the valleys. The people and things were hidden and beautiful. Mr. Wu enjoyed its loftiness and wandered in the forests and hills, forgetting to return. Mai respectfully inherited his father's wishes and sought this spiritual house. He soon found a lucky burial site. The tomb was set. He used the winter of the Xinwei year to bury the coffin and seal the tomb, so that his body would be forever at peace. Therefore, he narrated his virtuous conduct and engraved a stele on the tomb, hoping that the heavens would be of high quality and that there would be no record of slander. Cixi Feng Kaibiao.</p>
<h3>The Art of Longevity</h3>
<p>— Li Hanwen</p>
<p>The lifespan of a person can reach a maximum of one hundred years. However, it is rare to see this now. This is because the environment in which a person lives and all other things can harm the body, thus reducing lifespan invisibly. I have been researching this for a long time and have paid special attention to the following points. I feel that my body is much stronger than before. Because I dare not keep this a secret, I have recorded it and submitted it to the newspaper for the reference of my countrymen.</p>
<p>Regardless of gender, everyone must drink several cups of boiled water every day to cleanse the stomach and intestines. You must get up and sleep on time, neither early nor late. Your diet should be fixed, neither excessive nor insufficient. Defecate once a day on time. Exercise a little after work. Labor and rest must be equal. You must not consume cigarettes, alcohol, etc. Consuming them is extremely harmful to the body. Do not be overly happy or overly worried. Do not stay up all night.</p>
<p>The house must be decorated elegantly and cleanly. Do not pursue extravagance. There should be many windows. Even in winter, they should not be tightly closed. Open the windows even more when heating the fire to circulate fresh air. You must travel outside once a month. Do not hurry when walking. You must walk slowly. In summer, do not eat too many meat dishes. A vegetarian diet is best.</p>
<p>You must not destroy your thoughts, because destroying your thoughts is most likely to harm your body, especially when you are sick. When you are sick, you must be calm and peaceful, not impatient, and not delusional. You should live near a garden. Pay attention to the temperature at all times.</p>
<p>Do not have evil thoughts or desires when you are idle. If there is something that is not satisfactory, you should wait patiently for it to be resolved. Do not show a sad face. If you encounter something that is satisfying, do not be overjoyed. In short, you should be happy and content. Do not be pessimistic. You must be content with everything and do not ask for too much. Marriage should be delayed. Sexual desire must be strongly avoided. If you can follow the above points, your lifespan will surely increase. Readers, please try it according to the law, and you will know that my words are not false.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence</h3>
<p>(Ninety-four)</p>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Diary of a Tour in Italy</p>
<p>(Three) Ten Days in Rome (17)</p>
<p>June 4th: St. Peter's Grand Cathedral 丨 Vatican Palace 丨 Sistine Chapel 丨</p>
<p>After seeing the statue of Octavian, I turned around and saw the statue of the "Scrubbing Youth," a familiar masterpiece of Greek art from reproductions. This is a work by Lysippos, a master of the later period of Greek art (before the Common Era). The title is "The Scrubber" (Sthlite se prottant aves le Strigile), depicting the divine vigor of a person scrubbing dirt off during a bath. It is a representative work that perfectly captures the vitality of human muscles and has become a standard for later generations. This very famous life-size statue is a nude figure of a young man. His left hand is raised, and his right hand holds a strigil, rubbing his left arm. Its special feature is the extremely stable depiction of the waist, while the chest is slightly forward. The left foot supports the weight, forcing the right foot to bend forward. This expression in a static statue can be said to have achieved the greatest dynamism of human movement, truly capturing the core of human agility. This is due to a balance painstakingly planned by Lysippos, who changed the traditional ratio of seven head-lengths to eight. Therefore, all muscles and joints can express robust and vigorous vitality. It is said that Lysippos was the court artist of Alexander the Great, inheriting the style of Palycleitos (circa 460 BCE), and was good at sculpting nude figures of young men.</p>
<p>Next, we admired the colossal statue of Rome, "Nile and Sixteen Gods of Love" (Nilo a Aec I6 Amours). The magnificence of their faces and the robustness of their bodies are another realm altogether. When viewing these masterpieces of ancient Rome, everyone cannot help but be amazed and feel the greatness of the Roman spirit in these statues.</p>
<p>These rare treasures are displayed in a hall called Braccio Nuovo. Winding and turning, there are many portraits and various kinds of beasts, walking, lying down, or gathered together, vivid and full of life. Their rich and fulfilling life gives people eternal and boundless comfort.</p>
<p>After circling and admiring them, we walked out of the Craccio Nuovo hall and saw a wide courtyard in the distance. In the middle was a fountain, spraying cool mist. Countless beautiful flowering plants were scattered on the surrounding green lawns, exuding a faint, elegant fragrance. The floors of the surrounding corridors were paved with terrazzo bricks, similarly displaying fragments of sculptures. Groups of tourists came and went in an endless stream, joyfully admiring, seemingly blending with the art of the era, unaware of themselves, unaware of being in the bustling twentieth century.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Continues to Fluctuate Violently</h3>
<p>Fluctuations... Extremely Frightening</p>
<p>Drop... Nine Taels</p>
<p>Intense Process: Yesterday, the gold price experienced another violent fluctuation, extremely fierce. From morning to noon, there was a difference of more than thirty taels, causing extreme panic. It was like a sudden storm, leaving people unprepared. In the end, it trended downward. The exchange rate rose and then fell again, and the listed price did not change. It was likely that the overseas silver markets all reported declines, especially the United States, which continued to sell. Therefore, the gold price initially opened extremely sharply, immediately jumping ten taels. Then, Yuanmao, Yongzhi, Fengyongtai, Hengyuan, and hedging firms were quite eager to buy, and then suddenly broke through the 750 tael mark, reaching a shocking new record of 755 taels, an unprecedented peak. However, major bullish players like Hengxing, Yuanxing, Yonghengxing, Yuanfuchang, and Chenfengyong were eager to sell, and the exchange rate suddenly loosened, with hopes for the development of export goods, to prevent the silver market from rebounding. As a result, the gold price suddenly underwent a violent reaction, triggering extremely fierce turbulence, plummeting more than thirty taels. However, the situation was chaotic and unpredictable, with reversals of ten taels from time to time. Later, it suddenly fell to 721 taels and a fraction. At noon, it seemed to ease slightly, hovering around 26 taels. The spot price was about to catch up with the forward price, with a difference of only five qian. The market volume was estimated to be more than 30,000 taels. This morning, it is predicted that large contracts will rebound by a quarter. The market was closed in the afternoon as usual due to Saturday.</p>
<p>The initial soaring price, calculated from the opening of the March contract in the morning, was 745.5 taels, a huge jump of ten taels (the raw price rose from 40 taels to as high as 47 or 48 taels, with buyers being aggressive). However, the authorities of the exchange reiterated the prohibition of over-the-counter trading and issued a notice yesterday. However, the brokers turned a deaf ear. As for large contracts, they had already fallen by 5/16, and the silver price had also fallen by 6/8. The private telegrams were the same. Later, the major players were very keen to buy, and the price rose another ten taels, reaching 55 taels. This was likely a sign of a strong exchange rate. Mitsui bought 131,875 March English gold, and then sold 125 to 1875, and Yuanxing, Yonghengxing, Hengxingyuan, etc., took the opportunity to sell. The reason for the plunge was that the price of silk abroad was heard to have risen sharply, so export goods might develop, and there was hope for silver prices to rise. Therefore, when the industry heard this news, the gold price quickly retreated, falling sharply by 14 or 15 taels. At 9:20, it was calculated to be 40 taels. The advance notice had not been changed. At this time, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. At 9:30, it was 44 taels. Shortly thereafter, the internal market also loosened. March and April English gold could be settled at 1325, but some traders were dumping. In the trading floor, Hengxing, Shengda, Yuanxing, and Yong were selling vigorously, and the price seemed to be unable to recover. It plunged another fifteen taels. At 10:00, it was 28.5 taels, but there were advances and retreats of three or four taels from time to time. Later, Yuancheng, Yongwu, and others rushed to buy, and the price jumped more than six taels in half an hour. At 10:30, it was 35 taels, but the sellers were tireless, the market was chaotic, and English gold continued to weaken. Mitsui bought 4-month contracts at 13.5 to 13.5625, but it was not easy to sell, so the price fell into a weak state again. Yifengyong and Chenfengyong sold until 11:10, when it suddenly plunged to 21.5 taels. Afterward, the Dalian gang and Bingxing, Zhifengyong, Yuanyong, and Maoyong entered the market to buy, so it jumped more than eight taels. At 11:56, it was 30 taels, but there were few transactions in the foreign exchange market. By the close of the market, English gold was settled at 134375 to half a penny. However, the gold price rebounded at noon, retreating to 726.5 taels, a drop of nine taels compared to the previous day. After that, it was done at 22 or 23 taels, and then the goods were sold, and finally it was raised to 26 taels. It was truly a volatile and crazy market, almost like a state of mental disorder.</p>
<p>The extreme strength of the rise and fall: the maximum price in half a day was 755 taels, and the minimum price was 720 taels and five qian, a difference of 33 taels and five qian. The danger of the future is self-evident. The goods opened early at 45 taels and closed at 20 taels at noon. The listed price was still 786 taels and six qian, a decrease of 43 to 64 or 5 taels. The noon closing was 60 taels. The February account was 722 taels, the March account was 27 taels, the water supplement was 22 taels, and the jewelry was converted to 100 yuan and 005 jiao.</p>
<p>Speculative disturbances: Trading in various firms was still prosperous. It is estimated that the Guang gang Hengxingshengda bullish players came out, totaling about 5,000 contracts. Hengxingyuan, Chenfengyong, Changshengyong, Yuda, Yuanxingyong, Yuancheng, Fuchang, etc., also sold. Wanxing and Shunli had more sales than purchases, while Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Bingxing, Hengyu, Taihengyuan, and goods were purchased. Yuantai, Dakang, Xinxing, and Zhifengyong had varying degrees of buying and selling. The situation in the other firms was extremely chaotic and difficult to investigate. The Dalian gang bought more than 1,000 contracts and sold more than 3,000 contracts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Strong, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Buy and Then Sell</p>
<p>Bar Silver Expected to Rise Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets saw another sharp decline. The United States had a strong desire to sell, and the market was thus sluggish. British and American exchange rates fell slightly, and the market was quiet. Yokohama and Kobe were both stagnant. It is estimated that the HSBC listing in this port, with the exception of Hong Kong adding one or two taels, calculated at 77 taels and five qian, remained unchanged. However, the internal market was extremely strong in the morning, and then reversed and weakened. Because the gold market turned from rising to soft, and because the price of Chinese silk abroad rose sharply, Shanghai export goods were about to develop, so foreign merchants and banks had to sell foreign exchange, to prevent large contracts from rebounding. Generally, foreign markets regard the Shanghai market as the turning point. As a result, the gold price suddenly fell from outside 750 taels to within 30 taels, with a difference of more than 30 taels in half a day, causing a shocking change. By the close of the market at noon, compared with the previous day, English gold added 1/875, American gold added 3/75, and Japanese gold fell by one cent. Chinese merchants in the gold industry bought and then sold, with English gold transactions totaling about 200,000 pounds. Banks such as Shanghai, Mitsui, Anda, and Sumitomo all sold, and Mitsui Sumitomo also absorbed. Various banks also traded tens of thousands of pounds with each other, and did more than 100,000 yuan in US dollars. Chinese merchants settled 100,000 yuan. Japanese gold transactions were not smooth, with only Taiwan absorbing tens of thousands of yuan from Dalian. Since it was Saturday in the afternoon, there was no market. The overseas silver market may rebound today.</p>
<p>The fluctuation of English exchange in the internal market from morning to noon was only 375. The asking price for January was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 125, the buying price was 1/875, the asking price for April was 1/875, the buying price was 25.

As for changes, because the bond market was very quiet, the prices were very stagnant.

<h3>Yarn Market and Human Labor Fluctuate Three Times a Day</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly sluggish, but the trend is still tight. Because large players are buying to go long, and the gold price is strong, the price of third-grade yarn is high. Therefore, there are many off-market players going long. Although the demand for spot yarn is quiet, the sentiment is still strong. However, some people are also selling due to the decline in transactions. Two manufacturers will close their long positions this month, so the market is relatively loose. Buyers of distant months are still holding on tightly.</p>
<p>Human Labor (wages) Sees a Rebound and Decline: Human labor prices in the early market rebounded, because the residual energy from the previous day had not dissipated, and the sentiment was still high. Prices rose by four or five qian each. In the second and third sessions, they fell again, because the gold price rebounded slightly and the selling pressure was slightly stronger. Prices fell by four, five, six, seven, and nine qian each month. The market stabilized in the afternoon, and prices rose by one, three, and four qian each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,500 bales. The sales were 1,500 bales greater. Changfeng sold 1,900 bales. The remaining 500-600 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,400 bales, Meiji bought 1,050 bales, Rongxing bought 750 bales, and the remaining 500-600 bales. The closing price of Human Labor is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Sales of Spot Yarn are Flat: The statistics of purchases by various gangs are 500 bales. Transactions among colleagues were 25 bales. Market conditions were flat. Among the customer gangs, Tianjin purchased the largest amount, 130 bales. In addition, Ningbo purchased 40 bales, Yantai purchased 20 bales, inland purchased 85 bales, Fuzhou purchased 35 bales, Shantou purchased 65 bales, and miscellaneous gangs purchased 85 bales.</p>
<h3>Main Reason for Cotton Market Turning Soft</h3>
<p>Long Positions Liquidate... Gold Price Weakens</p>
<p>The cotton market atmosphere is slightly soft. Because long positions have been released for several days, the table is relatively loose. The phenomenon of floating short positions being covered seems to be full. The external cotton market is calm, and the gold price is falling. The market atmosphere is falling with it. However, the psychological factor of long positions is that the exchange rate is not rising, so it is difficult to cut losses. Therefore, new sellers are not daring to act rashly. There are currently no cracks. According to one part, the prices of Hankou Road can approach each other. Therefore, most of the Hankou gang have reversed to short positions.</p>
<p>Hankou Falls Seven Qian Half: The Hankou market opened in the early market, and the situation was still rising. After Hengde released a large number, the situation was relatively loose. There was a lack of buyers, and the gold price turned down. Therefore, the prices fell by four or five qian each month. The market was still weak in the afternoon. The current month fell by two qian. The distant months were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 100,100 dan. Tianlong sold 5,800 dan, Gengfeng sold 6,900 dan, and Shengtai sold 4,500 dan. Gongtai bought 6,100 dan, Rongxing bought 2,700 dan, and Yuanda bought 2,000 dan. The closing price of Hankou is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Acreage Reduction Plan Passed</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 16th reported on the raw cotton for the week. The shift to optimism in the New York Cotton Exchange's market mood over the past week has been quite pronounced. However, business in the market remains flat. Although there are intermittent hopes for a gradual improvement in business and buying due to the reduction in cotton fields, these are limited by the weak silver price and the closure of Lancashire cloth mills. It is heard that cooperatives will sell a small number of spot goods and purchase distant-month new cotton. There is no new news about the condition of the cotton fields in the South. However, all groups have passed plans for acreage reduction. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousand bales).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Suddenly Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Source from Qingyang Port Obstructed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of rice from the river in Zhabei was suddenly scarce. It is reported that the river channel at Qingyang Port was obstructed, resulting in a sudden shortage of rice boats arriving in Shanghai. Consequently, sales in this area turned active. Northern Japonica rice, which was originally softening, has now turned firm. Prices for high-grade Japonica rice are all showing good signs, but the overall trend is unlikely to rise excessively. The arrival of Bo rice is also limited, and the situation is trending towards stability due to flat sales. Yangxian and Buxian rice have uniformly turned from weak to firm. Although sales are not particularly brisk, the sentiment is improving. The overall market has risen slightly by half a chi (a traditional unit of length). There have been a few arrivals of Ke rice by train, and the market is steadily transforming. It is expected that cake sales and year-end sales will be strong as the end of the lunar year approaches, and the market price is expected to be firm. The special top-grade white rice opened at around thirteen yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of rice from various groups in South Shanghai was not abundant, and market sales were flat. Changzhou-Wuxi white Japonica rice turned stable due to scarcity, and the buying interest for Suzhou-Tongzhou white Japonica rice was slightly better. However, the prices of all Japonica rice remained flat, similar to the previous day. Southern groups are collecting early Bo rice here, and customers are selecting good quality rice and are very strict with the price. The market is stable. Yang Du Jian West Road has a limited supply, while the South Road has a slight supply, and retail sales are acceptable. Prices remain unchanged. The transformation of Yuan currency into silver is balanced in terms of sales. High-quality goods have been bid up recently, while ordinary Zhongguan rice is generally stable. Overall, the rice market in South Shanghai was stable throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Guang Group Actively Purchases Ke Yuan Rice</h3>
<p>Price Increases Significantly... Ningbo Group Purchases Hunan Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice was quite active. However, the local market's intention to purchase Ke Xian rice has waned due to the expectation of a large batch of river rice arriving soon with the clearing of the river channel. Nevertheless, the Ningbo group is actively purchasing Zhongguan rice in the market. Yesterday, they also purchased more than 400 bales of Hunan rice. The Guang group has also made some inquiries. The Guang group is more welcoming to Ke Yuan rice, purchasing 1,300 bales of Jiangxi machine-milled rice, with prices significantly higher than before. A total of 1,500 bales of Jiangxi machine-milled rice were traded at a price of thirteen yuan to twelve yuan and eight jiao. In addition, 1,000 bales of machine-milled late rice were traded at a price of eleven yuan five jiao two fen to three fen. Furthermore, 200 bales of machine-milled early rice were traded at a price of ten yuan and four jiao two fen. Hunan rice was traded at 413 bales at a price of ten yuan and five jiao nine fen to two jiao nine fen. Additionally, 500 bales of machine-milled Jing rice were traded at a price of eleven yuan and seven jiao to eleven yuan. 124 bales of Nanjing machine-milled rice were traded at a price of nine yuan and eight jiao. 80 bales of Chuzhou brown rice were traded at a price of eight yuan and three jiao.</p>
<h3>Dumping of Foreign Wheat Affects the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Inevitable Resurgence of Influence</p>
<p>Although foreign wheat prices fluctuated yesterday, it did not fundamentally affect the flour market, so sentiment remained stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, foreign firms and brokers were again dumping spot goods to various factories and brokers. It was heard that the combined price of Australian white wheat was slightly lower than before, only 4 taels 1 mace and 6 fen of Shanghai silver. Therefore, some manufacturers slightly sold off futures again. However, as the market sentiment was already weak, the factories stopped selling. As for the buying and selling inside and outside the industry, most tended to wait and see in order to close out positions. It is feared that the continued dumping of spot foreign wheat will inevitably have a resurgence of influence. As a result, the price for this month was down 2.5 li compared to the previous day, the price for February was down 7.5 li, the price for March and April was down 5 li, the price for May was unchanged, and the price for June was down 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Re-enters Weak Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed an initial stabilization followed by a weakening trend. Initially, the varying quotations for foreign wheat kept sentiment stable. However, due to very quiet buying, the market turned weak. As for the chips for this month, it was heard that factories had a lot of goods arriving themselves, and there were few who were prepared to take delivery. Futures were also softened by the dumping of spot wheat. Therefore, although the transactions in the afternoon were sparse, the market had already weakened. As a result, the price for this month was down 4 fen compared to the previous day, the price for March and April was down 2 fen, and there was no comparison for the others.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Yokohama Sugar Factory Continues to Offer 30,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Market Trading of the Association is Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegraphs reported that Cuban spot sugar was unchanged, New York sugar futures only rose by one point in May, and there were no changes in other months. The spot and futures prices of Javanese sugar also did not rise or fall. In the Association's market, due to the falling exchange rate, the sentiment turned weak, and the demand was even less. Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was quoted at 10 taels and 5 qian, Hong Kong goods at 10 taels and 4 qian, but the buying price was lower, and inquiries were scarce, resulting in no transactions. Furthermore, with the day after Saturday being a non-delivery day, the import and export of Japanese sugar was also slack. Meiji YT mark was 10 taels and 5.5 qian, Minghua goods were 10 taels and 5 qian, YP mark was 10 taels and 7 qian, and Meiji goods were 10 taels and 8 qian, with few buyers. The market was very depressed. The old goods of Taikoo HX mark were allocated by the industry, totaling 470 bags, at a price of 10 taels 2 qian per bag, and the market was still firm. As for the company's dumping of new goods, HX mark was 10 taels and 4 qian and DY mark was 10 taels and 5 qian, but there were still few inquiries. The Japanese sugar factory market offered 20,000 bags of Meiji sugar at a price of 4 yuan and 6 jiao in Japanese gold plus tax, and 10,000 bags of Minghua sugar at a price of 6 yuan and 7 jiao including tax, and the buyers were still active.</p>
<h3>Wu Fu White Rock Candy Can Arrive Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Wu Fu white rock candy had been suspended for many days due to the Lunar New Year holiday. According to the latest information, production has resumed earlier due to urgent sales in Shanghai. However, due to continuous rainy weather in the area, it could not be dried, so the output was slower. Two rounds have already passed without arrival. Yesterday, a telegram was received that a small number of goods had been shipped out, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (Monday). The prices have already been bid up, and the quoted price will definitely increase again.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories' Stocks are Scarce and Sales are Cleared</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market remained firm. It was found that the demand for Shanghai white filature from New York and other places was quite strong, and European and American firms still had strong intentions to purchase. However, due to the lack of stock on hand and the scarcity of raw materials, various manufacturers dared not sell too much. It was calculated that Lan Bi and others purchased 60 bales of medium-grade Shanghai white filature, and Samsung purchased 5 bales of Sichuan reeling filature. Prices have been significantly increased.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Tea's Russian Sales Revive</h3>
<p>The Russian Assistance Association in Shanghai, which handles tea, yesterday again invited various tea merchants to negotiate and trade Gongxi green tea. A total of 1,000 to 2,000 boxes were negotiated for sale, but the sales book has not yet been finalized. However, the reason for this start-up is actually due to the low tea price, and the head office telegraphed to continue the search for purchases. However, the Gongxi stock in the market is only about 5,000 boxes, and Baitou Zhuang still has a part of the sales volume. In fact, there is a great sense of supply falling short of demand.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: The Rising Trend of White Tung Oil Slightly Subsided</h3>
<p>The price of white tung oil was originally below 20 taels five years ago. Since the brisk sales in the American market, the lowest price in the past five or six years has been at least 25 taels, and the highest has reached 41 or 42 taels, although only for a very short time, it can be said to have created a new era in history. However, since the sharp rise in gold prices last spring, the finances of various countries have been affected. Although the American financial system is considered the strongest in the world, commercial development is inevitably difficult. The main destination for tung oil from our country is the United States, but the companies that manufacture paint there are constrained by finance, resulting in each (unclear text) each month (unclear text) above export of (unclear text) fell to below thousands of tons, the drastic changes in the market are self-evident. The production areas initially wanted to maintain due to cost factors, but after delaying for several months, there was still no vitality, and the price plummeted from 27 or 28 taels to 16 or 17 taels. The public thought that after this major setback, the situation would have to return to the state of five or six years ago. This continued for half a year, but unexpectedly at the end of the year, foreign firms in Hankou suddenly rushed to purchase, and from out of the blue, a cyan dragon suddenly appeared. In an instant, the wind and clouds rose, and within half a month, the price rose to 23 or 24 taels, which can be said to be the extreme of illusion. According to a telegram from Hankou yesterday, the selling price of foreign firms is 23 taels as the regular market, and it seems that it can stand firm. Brokers in Shanghai have purchased about 6,000 to 7,000 dan (a traditional unit of weight) during this sharp rise, with Zhejiang oil accounting for eight or nine parts, and the price is about 30 yuan per tan or less. However, it is now winter, the time for domestic sales to clear, and although foreign firms have slightly gone that route, it is not as smooth as before. It is said that the selling price is 23 taels and 5 or 6 qian per dan at the highest. However, having been quiet for a long time, this activity is enough to add color to the market. It is hoped that foreign firms can continue to handle it, so that the market will have a more solid footing. Otherwise, if domestic sales do not increase support, it will inevitably be imperfect.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Are Getting Higher and Higher</h3>
<p>The price of cloth from local factories is rising sharply, with a tendency to soar. This is because the export tax is about to be implemented, and all parties are worried that the price of goods will skyrocket after the increase, so local customers are searching for purchases very hard. Those who hold the goods are uniformly hoarding and not selling, so the prices are getting higher and higher. Yesterday, fine cloth rose by about 1 qian, Yanghe, Caiqiu, Laba, and Tongjun were 7 taels for customs clearance, and fine twill rose by 5 fen. Coarse cloth is most scarce with 9-pound goods. The Ningbo, Wenzhou, and inland groups are purchasing fiercely, showing a state of supply falling short of demand. Five-width cloth is 4 taels 4 qian and 7.5 fen, and the spot goods are still scarce. 11-pound cloth has also reached about 5 taels. Coarse twill has also slightly firmed. Ewo bleached cloth rose another 2 qian yesterday, reaching 8 taels and 4 qian.</p>
<p>The market situation for East and West cloths continues to rise. The prices of Donghuo's straight tribute flannel and straight tribute continue to reach new highs. This is because the sales channels for customer groups are exceptionally smooth, so brokers' spot goods are being sold as soon as they arrive. In addition, the exchange rate consistently refuses to fall, and the excitement of the sentiment is unprecedented. Yesterday, printed straight tribute flannel opened at 3 qian and 9 fen. Zhongshan flannel rose about 1 fen due to the strong purchasing by the Sichuan group. Jiao Ye Tishu opened at 3 qian, Huantai Zi 2 qian 8 fen and 7 li, and Fuyou Si Hai Xiaoyao Jin was 2 qian and 8 fen and a half. Moganshan straight tribute flannel was sold yesterday for 3 qian 8 fen and 7 li, Lieyan 3 qian 9 fen and 2 li, and Yipin also required 3 qian and 5 fen and a half. Mian Fa, Fu Hua, and concubine colors were 2 qian and 3 fen, Liang Wudi large red 2 qian and 2 fen and a half, Damo thick white 3 qian, and Fu Hua white 2 qian and 1 fen and a half. These high prices are unprecedented in recent years. The price of Western bleached cloth has soared by about 2 taels. Baiyang yarn, Ramie yarn, and Yuan Yu silk have all opened at unprecedented new highs. Fangli straight tribute flannel has also reached 3 qian and 1 fen.</p>

<h3>About Oil Painting</h3>
<p>By Yamamoto Kanae</p>
<p>Translated by Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>It is said that famous paintings are not only pleasing to the eye but also delightful to the touch. However, when it comes to clumsy oil paintings, as soon as one encounters that sense of materiality (Translator's note: this refers to the painting failing to express tonal or quantitative beauty, instead revealing only the material sense of the raw materials and pigments; that is, the expression is empty, only evoking the qualities of the materials), one's enthusiasm vanishes. Especially in those stubbornly attempting to appear profound, melancholic, and viscous still-life paintings, and in those stiffly striving to express brilliant colors, obsessively rendered self-portraits, there is something that makes the heart heavy upon seeing them. The former evokes images of corpses' skin, rotten fish, the mud of sewers, poverty, mold, lung disease, depression, and the like. The latter evokes images of iron filings, sores, elephantiasis, scalded blisters, madness, and so on.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>During the clumsy stage, one tends to stubbornly cling to this sense of materiality. After all, the result of this clinging is a half-dead brushstroke, floating piles of pigment, thus creating a unique ugliness. However, the person himself, upon seeing this immediately obvious ugliness, strangely feels a knowing interest, and self-identifies as possessing... sincerity, surging passion, individuality, philosophical flavor, Inspiration, Volume, and so on, looking at it again and again without tiring. This is truly mysterious. In fact, even the author has not seen "nature," i.e., their Motive (subject matter or cause for painting), as so turbid. This is just like the situation with young children. Why? Because young children often draw mothers and fathers with arms and legs growing directly out of their faces. In reality, they have never seen human figures in that way; it is simply that what they see and what they draw are mistaken. That is to say, it is the same. It is merely infantile. However, their difference from children lies in their self-importance.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>In the early learning stage, one often becomes eccentric, exclusively favoring old canvases. This is not for the sake of saving money, but rather because they cherish the act of painting over and using (Translator's note: "painting over" means painting again on a canvas that has already been painted on, that is, covering up the painting underneath). No matter how many times they paint over, the reason why canvases painted so heavily they resemble concrete slabs are valued is that they supposedly impart a "deep flavor" to the painting. However, this is a superstition; instead of producing a deep flavor, it creates frustration. In fact, the heavy texture created on an old canvas and the heavy texture built up layer by layer on a new canvas have a difference like that between pure gold and gilt. In short, it is best not to use old canvases with pigments piled up like scars. Although some people thickly coat new boards or canvases with white pigment, creating desirable brushstroke patterns, and wait for them to dry completely before painting on them, this is different from the case of old canvases. After all, this is a carefully prepared canvas specifically to facilitate the painting to be created, so the fresh "sense of materiality" will not be harmed.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Lovers of old canvases are also those who meticulously study frames. Naturally, they are also miserly scholars. Some of their frames are homemade from tree trunks with the bark still on, or from roughly sawn pieces of wood, creating personalized, angular items. Others have gold leaf peeling off badly, or plaster falling off, and so on. They actually fit their paintings, which are like a second life to them, into such frames and take them to exhibitions without any concern. Why don't they feel bad about that kind of poverty and ugliness? Originally, they don't see it as poverty but rather as simplicity, and even feel a primitive boldness. They don't see it as ugliness but rather feel a kind of transcendent elegance. In fact, if you see your painting as serious work, then even if the frame is too rough, it's best to avoid it. In any case, I advise people to use new canvases and display their paintings in neat frames for enjoyment. If general exhibits always carry the appearance of beggars, patients, and madmen, it would be truly embarrassing.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Recently, young people's oil paintings can be roughly divided into two trends. One is the trend produced by French paintings imported by Thiers-Nisse (Translator's note: Thiers-Nisse was a French art dealer), which involves thick dabs of paint applied with broad brushstrokes in an energetic manner, completely disregarding both "tonal nature" and "color nature." The other is a silent obsession with accurately depicting objects, which is a trend of the so-called Sotosha style (Translator's note: Sotosha was a group of Western-style painters formerly organized by Kishida Ryūsei, Kimura Shōhachi, etc.). One is bright and cheerful, the other is gloomy. One is rough, the other is timid. One is submitted to the Nikakai, the other is submitted to the Shun'yōkai. This is so formulaic. But I distrust both. Why? Because neither is the work of a truly earnest art student, nor is it the work of a discerning artist. In short, it is due to the work of busybodies who constantly chase after the excitement of exhibitions. Originally, the French imitative style of N. Vlaminck, a French painter, is a technique that can be easily successful with only a small talent for imitating brushstrokes, ignorance of formal beauty, and the courage to use paint thickly. As for the Sotosha imitative style, it only requires being able to meticulously depict objects. Therefore, there is a reason why many busybodies emerge in these two trends. Consequently, how many busybodies there are in the art world today! It is said that gambling on horse racing was permitted with the aim of improving horse breeds. As a result, the mentality of seeking profit through luck has been exposed to baseness, and public opinion has led to the decisive abolition of betting tickets... Perhaps it would be better to temporarily abolish large-scale exhibitions in the art world as well.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Recently, thin-汁 style oil paintings have become very popular. The so-called thin-汁 style involves thinning the pigment with turpentine or Poppy Oil, painting with a flavor similar to watercolor, and applying thick paint to the bright parts while it is still wet, aiming for an overall soft feeling in the oil painting. This method is mastered by Mr. Umehara Ryūzaburō and is the style seen in the late paintings of Renoir (transliteration note: Penoir, a famous modern French painter). Mr. Nakagawa Kazumasa has also been using this method recently. Mr. Kosugi Misei's oil paintings also use this technique, although the style is slightly different. In short, the thin-汁 style can give a soft flavor to the painting. However, beginners who imitate this method often make the painting weak. In the thin-汁 style of painting, if one experiments with applying the paint on the canvas (Translator's note: that is, applying the brush with the attitude of studying and practicing), it will fail. Also, it is necessary to choose the canvas, brush, oil, and pigment appropriately. Renoir and Mr. Umehara both use canvases with a slightly rough weave, such as sharkskin, which clearly exposes the weave. That kind of canvas can give the paint a lively feel. As for the oil, if only turpentine is used, it is too light and dries too easily, losing its luster. Therefore, it is necessary to mix it with a moderate amount of poppy oil. It is said that the most appropriate method is to mix equal parts of high-quality petroleum (petroleum) for painting and poppy oil. Speaking of pigments, hard pigments are not suitable when painting in this way. Only fresh pigments that can dissolve softly in the oil liquid will do. Furthermore, one must pay close attention to the properties of the pigments, such as transparency, semi-transparency, or opacity. In thin-汁 style paintings, transparent and semi-transparent pigments seem to be generally favored, while opaque mineral pigments are gradually applied thickly to the bright parts of the tone. Thin-汁 style painting is a one-stroke process in oil painting. Its color should express its "elegance" in relation to the canvas, just like the ink color of Japanese painting. Therefore, if the initial work fails, it is not advisable to try to fix it; instead, one must repaint it on a new canvas. In the thin-汁 style of painting, encountering difficulties is a fatal blow. Therefore, it is a difficult technique for beginners.</p>
<h3>Persian Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Location: London, England</p>
<p>Date: Opened on the 7th of this month</p>
<p>By De Ming</p>
<p>In recent years, England has held world art exhibitions of various countries year after year. Exhibitions such as the Dutch art exhibition and the Italian exhibition have all been grand in scale and rich in collections, achieving great success one after another. This year, the news of holding a Persian art exhibition in the New Year has made those who care about art jump for joy.</p>
<p>The exhibition opened on the 7th of this month and will last approximately two months.</p>
<p>The patrons of the exhibition are the King of England and the King of Persia, which shows its general importance.</p>
<p>The exhibits in this exhibition, like those in previous Dutch art exhibitions and Italian art exhibitions, are borrowed from the collections of royal museums, libraries, and private collections around the world and exhibited together. In terms of collecting exhibits, this exhibition has an international character, so the official name of the conference is "The International Exhibition of Persian Art".</p>
<p>The importance of Persian art lies not only in its beauty but also in its great influence and stimulation on the composition (design) art of various countries in Asia and Europe throughout history. Tracing back to the source, Persia is indeed a great creative center in art history. Persian art not only has a long history, but also its scope is extremely broad. It has magnificent architectural decorations, exquisite stone carvings and copper engravings, pottery comparable to that of China and Greece, objects made of gold, silver, glass, and porcelain that are unmatched in the world, exquisite miniature paintings, gorgeous brocades, velvet embroidered curtains and carpets, beautifully bound books, exquisite wooden objects, and so on. These are all displayed in the Persian art exhibition, which truly makes viewers feel as if they are on the Shanyin Road, overwhelmed by the abundance.</p>
<h3>The Art of Charles Despiau, the New Leader of the French Sculpture World</h3>
<p>— By Chen Deming</p>
<p>The position of leader of the French sculpture world has been vacant for a long time since the death of Antoine Bourdelle last year. Because France, the center of modern art, has many first-class artists, in other words, many people can be the leader of the art world. Therefore, the question of who should fill the vacant position of leader of the French sculpture world caused by Bourdelle's departure is truly thought-provoking. For a year, after careful discussions and considerations by many authorities and famous critics in the French art world, Charles Despiau was recently given the highest honor of leader of the French sculpture world (the leader of the French sculpture world is actually the leader of the world's sculpture).</p>
<p>Now I will introduce Mr. Despiau's life and art to the readers.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Despiau's Life Mr. Despiau was born in 1874. He first studied art at a technical school, and then entered the National School of Fine Arts (Renoir's painting ( ) see "About Oil Painting").</p>
<p>specializing in sculpture. When he graduated, his art was already considerable, but no one appreciated it for a while. Fortunately, he made a living by drawing illustrations for others, earning a small income. At the same time, he constantly studied sculpture and strived for improvement. Later, he became an assistant to Rodin, the king of modern sculpture. He gained a lot of secrets of sculptural art while being close to Rodin, and his art improved day by day. However, he was still unknown at that time, and no one paid attention to his works. His life was truly extraordinarily difficult. Mr. Despiau's fame has only come in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr. Despiau is naturally indifferent, does not seek fame and fortune, and does not like to socialize. He only focuses on studying sculpture. He is quite confident in his own art, but he never boasts about it. This solitary nature is the reason why he became famous late, and it is also the reason why he was able to achieve great success. All true scholars and artists have always been like Mr. Despiau. (2) Mr. Despiau's Art Mr. Despiau's specialty is portraits and nudes. Mr. Despiau's portrait sculptures not only seek to perfectly resemble the appearance, but he goes further to express a person's character (Character. He not only expresses a person's character, but he goes even further to express a person's personality (Personality. Moreover, he borrows the appearance of an individual (An Individual) to express the common nature of people of an era. In other words, his sculpture is not only a portrait of a person, but a portrait of people of an era. There is tranquility in the commotion and commotion in the tranquility on his sculptures, which is indeed a true picture of modern people. In his sculptures, we see many tragedies and comedies of modern people, just as the portraits of Jan van Eyck in the fifteenth century and Rembrandt in the seventeenth century are immortal records of the tragedies and comedies of people at that time. We see the personality of the person being portrayed in Mr. Despiau's sculptures, and even more so the common nature of modern people. But that's not all. We see even more the personality and soul of the author, as well as the concentrated work attitude that makes the sculpture a masterpiece.</p>
<p>What is expressed in Mr. Despiau's nude sculptures are (1) harmony and rhythm, and (2) the usual joys and sorrows of people. Mr. Despiau's sculptures have simple forms and profound expressions. For example, for the war memorial sculpture for his hometown Mont-de-Marsan, he only sculpted two figures: an old woman praying and a young woman who is a mother. However, the grief and respect of the people of the country, old and young, for the fallen soldiers has been completely expressed in that simple memorial sculpture. Its effect far surpasses some flamboyant memorial sculptures.</p>
<p>In addition to sculpture, Mr. Despiau is also skilled in sketching (note that sculptors can generally sketch, because they need to make quick drafts before sculpting, and Rodin is also a master of sketching). The vividness and variety of his sketches are amazing. In those sketches, we see his reaction to life. We see him expanding and embellishing life. Mr. Despiau's sketches are actually more beautiful and thought-provoking than Rodin's sketches.</p>
<p>Above, we have discussed Mr. Despiau's everything separately, but in fact we cannot discuss him separately. His personality and art are integrated. What he mentions and loves is the ever-changing and yet unified life. Most modern artists dissect life into pieces and express it. Mr. Despiau expresses life as a whole and endows it with eternal youth. Also, most modern artists like to use abstract forms to express life, while Mr. Despiau expresses life concretely. To sum up, the art of most modern artists is incomplete, while Mr. Despiau's art is complete. The art of most artists is empty in content, while Mr. Despiau's art is rich in content. This is the difference between Mr. Despiau and others, and it is also his superiority. It is also the reason why he is today the leader of the French sculpture world.</p>
