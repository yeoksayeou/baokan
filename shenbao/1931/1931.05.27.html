<p>日本之减俸潮據最近形勢各省官吏方面之反對者仍在猛烈前進而政府方面則閣議已决定實行僅將辦法略加修改并聲明俟財政稍裕時即行恢復原俸此種辦法仍未能滿反對者之意固爲政府所深知而政府所以敢毅然爲之者其理由以近來商業凋敝農民收入皆减而官吏獨享高俸殊不公平此說確能博民衆之同情今日全國町村長之决議贊成政府政策正以此故又以官吏受下級俸給者多下級俸給不受减俸影響今亦附和反對减俸者恐政府以减俸爲裁員之先聲使果實行第二步裁員則雖小俸給亦將不免故亦起而和附之政府知其癥結所在而許以不裁保障則大可减殺罷業風潮之勢力觀今日與路員妥協之議是政府之政策亦已略見小效矣雖然下級官吏罷業之風潮固屬可慮而上級官吏之無形怠業亦豈不可慮耶凡百事業之進展全恃一致合作之精神精神不屬而形骸徒具冥冥中墮落實多故今日日本之减俸潮縱能勉强消滅於一時而實際上妨碍政治之進展甚大殊非計之得者也</p>

<h3 id="c228">自由輪之原理構造及功用 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 國祥</p>
<p>自由輪（Free　Wheeling）之原理並非新奇數年前英法曾一度試騐之但結果對於汽車未能普及今也美國汽車界先後採納此原理以改進機件之完備消耗之經濟余在第一稿件上曾略提及今欲將此題目分作三部討論</p>
<p>（一）原理　其全部原理即動力（Momentum）所發生之推進力試觀一兒童乘足踏車速度踏至最快時兒童忽停止前踏按理則車之速度必大减但車仍前衝去極速此何故歟蓋因動力所發生之推進力（參看下圖CDE表明推力）在足踏車上此機件稱之曰飛此原理現已應用於汽車上</p>
<p>（二）構造　自由輪係裝設於變速箱内其構造可分爲二大部份（參看下圖A箭頭處即自由輪之裝設）一爲外部之套箱（Casing）二爲内部之軸心（Core）自由輪在不工作時此二部風馬牛不相及毫無關係在此二者之間有錐形跑道三每跑道内有一列逐第增大之鋼球四枚此四球可來回跑道中（參看下圖B）外部套箱係隨引擎之力轉動内部之軸心則轉動驅進軸（Popelles　sbaft）因之而傳力於後輪當引擎拖動汽車前進時三列鋼球（十二枚）被迫至各跑道之狹端連接引擎與後輪當化油器風門關閉時引擎立時减速外部套箱旋亦隨之而减此時車之動力驅内部之軸心旋轉使鋼球滾入跑道之擴端於是引擎與後輪脫離關係但車仍向前駛行極速此種進行動作均爲自然無需踏克拉子掀動擋排或其他管理</p>
<p>（三）功用　自由輪之功用甚多今綜合而爲三一車行之安穏二消耗之節省三駕駛之舒適</p>
<p>一車行之安穏尋常之三擋排及四擋排車下山坡時不易得第二擋排之引擎制力裝設自由輪則可獲此利益故下山時非常安穏再自第二擋排調三擋排或三擋排調二擋排均不必踏克拉子（仍踏亦無妨）但引擎速度必與車行速度相等或較高車行穏妥無衝動之虞當車行至鐵道及公路交叉處祇移動自由輪至第二擋排車速即减安然駛過同時對於催速亦無妨礙更無　滯之弊無論車行之速度如何可隨意改用擋排車之四輪即脫離推力　减少滑性在之日之氷道上尤稱便利</p>
<p>二消耗之節省其最重要之節省爲引擎廻轉次數每次自由輪契合時引擎即停止工作平均言之車行十里引擎祇工作八里行一萬里引擎省二千里之工作按各公司試騐結果可節省百分之二十至四十不等由此艱之可延長引擎之壽命次之爲汽油滑油自由輪工作時風門關閉故汽油可節省百分之十二至二十引擎停止則滑油可省百分之二十尙有减少平時養車修理及引擎去炭費用不少其他因利用自由輪車内各機件均延長壽命者如克拉子（Clutcb）傳力器（Transmission）主動齒輪（Driving　gear）後輪軸（Rear　axle）活結（Uninersal　joint）橡皮輪等是也</p>
<p>三駕駛之舒適車上裝設自由輪後駕駛較易噪聲免除車行駛時寂靜無聲增加駕駛之舒適不可尤有進者駕駛人屢因汽車之不易管理手續繁雜遇交通擁擠時則心荒意亂莫之所措心急神衰因而肇禍者甚多裝設自由輪者則否旣無麻煩手續管理復無困憊神亂之虞進退自如隨心所欲自由輪之功用亦大矣</p>

<p>我們的砲手都被打死了旣没有彈藥又没有兵士全船被烟和火迷漫着艦長因爲要救未死的船員便將船向灘邊開去</p>
<p>我在右舷的機器間裏、早已遭着火燒當我們奉得命令開放活拴上升甲板時引擎的曲柄已經擊在水面化成白沬我們照着命令而行不過敵人的砲火將引擎間擊毁不堪二十個人中間祗有兩個人能照令上升甲板其餘的人都被砲火打死或者受着破裂汽管中射出的沸水將生命喪失我和一個年長的弁目總算幸運非凡逃出難關我在開放活拴的時候幾乎受盪喪命幸虧一股油救了我的性命</p>
<p>我身上的衣服撕裂無餘當初自己還不覺得裸着身體直等伸手入袋裏纔曉得週身全赤我旣没有口袋又没有衣服使我非常難堪</p>
<p>我從一個洞穴裏爬上甲板砲彈仍舊在各處爆發我從濃烟烈熖裏看見巨大的浪濤直向甲板衝來我想我們勢必至於盡入波底其餘的人也許有這種思想因爲他們躍入水中與沉船相離我正想追隨於他們之後頓時間好像是我的善靈止住我不向水裏跳返轉身子穿過烟熖走到右舷去那裏艦長茂婁正在施救傷人烟熖比前稍爲淡了大家歡呼着似乎忘懐一切我們看見我們的旗幟在桅頂上飄盪着在這時候一個受傷流血的兵士從擊壞的砲旁躏跚向前嘴裏喊道「爲艦長歡呼三聲」霎時間這人跌倒在甲板上這個兵士便永久地靜默了</p>

<p>Changsha, the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and educational groups of Changsha City jointly telegraphed Chen Jitang on the 24th, recounting the intensity of the disasters caused by rebellious bandits over the years and the efforts of Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang in suppressing the Gui and Zhang factions. Now, the three provinces are encircling and suppressing them step by step, aiming to eliminate the filth and eradicate the roots forever. Yet, comrades are again imitating the rebellious actions of Gui, Zhang, and others, recklessly disrupting the three-province bandit suppression plan, offering the Communist bandits an opportunity to take advantage of, and plunging the people into a desperate situation. These comrades are not only guilty of betraying the party and disrupting the country but are also the chief culprits of indulging bandits and harming the people, whom the world can condemn. It is hoped that they will repent and correct their mistakes without hesitation, turning disaster into blessing with a single shift in thought. If they stubbornly persist and willingly remain as rebel leaders, although the central government is benevolent, the laws of the country will be strictly enforced against rebels. Our associations will lead hundreds of thousands of people in Changsha to petition the central government to launch a large-scale punitive expedition to secure our national foundation. What is auspicious and what is ominous, may the comrades consider it carefully, etc. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Recent Trends in Salary Cuts in Japan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the trend of salary cuts in Japan, according to recent developments, opposition from officials in various provinces is still progressing fiercely, while the government has decided to implement it in a cabinet meeting, only slightly modifying the method and stating that it will restore the original salary when finances are slightly better. The government is well aware that this method still cannot satisfy the opposition. The reason why the government dares to do so resolutely is that commerce has been declining recently, and farmers' incomes have been reduced, while officials alone enjoy high salaries, which can indeed win the sympathy of the public. Today, the resolution of the national village chiefs to support the government's policy is precisely because of this. Moreover, officials who receive lower salaries are mostly unaffected by salary cuts, and now they also echo the opposition to salary cuts, fearing that the government will use salary cuts as a prelude to layoffs. If the second step of layoffs is indeed implemented, even small salaries will not be spared, so they also rise up and echo. The government knows the crux of the matter and promises not to lay off and protect them, which can greatly reduce the power of the strike tide. Judging from today's compromise with railway employees, the government's policy has already shown a slight effect. Although the strike tide of lower-level officials is indeed worrying, is the invisible slackness of upper-level officials not also worrying? The progress of all undertakings depends entirely on the spirit of unity and cooperation. If the spirit is not in place, the body is merely a shell, and the downfall in the dark is indeed caused by many things. Today, even if Japan's salary cut tide can be barely eliminated for a time, it actually greatly hinders the progress of politics and is not a well-considered plan.</p>

<p>Compromise Reached with Railway Personnel</p>
<p>One Wave Subsides, Another Arises</p>
<p>Postal, Commercial, and Industrial Provinces Brewing Boycott</p>
<p>Army and Navy Officers Join Opposition League</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: The officials' salary reduction plan was passed by the Cabinet today, with only minor revisions to the original proposal. After the Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister went to the Imperial Palace, anticipating that the Emperor would issue an edict announcing the implementation of the salary reduction on June 1st. It is reported that the government intends to issue a statement declaring that the current salaries will be restored as soon as the national finances permit.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: At today's Cabinet meeting, Railway Minister Eguchi first gave a detailed report on the fierce opposition within the Railway Ministry, requesting understanding for the inevitable permanent retirement funds of railway personnel. Finance Minister Inoue said that the special circumstances of the railway were recognized by the party, but this could not be stipulated by edict, only by Cabinet approval, because if an edict were used, other provinces would follow suit. Therefore, the retirement funds must still follow the current form. All cabinet members agreed to this. Next, ministers such as Koizumi reported on the situation in their respective provinces. Only Justice Minister Watanabe remained silent about the intense opposition movement of judicial officials.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: The government is currently working hard to alleviate the opposition to the salary reduction. Today's Cabinet meeting decided to submit a bill to the 60th Diet to revise the pension law and stipulate transitional laws to supplement the reduced pensions due to the salary reduction.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: At 11 p.m. last night, Railway Minister Eguchi met with the Railway Personnel Special Committee and reached a compromise, the contents of which are as follows: (1) Compensation other than salaries will not be reduced. (1) Permanent retirement compensation will be established. (1) Special commendations will be considered for those who have served for many years upon retirement. (1) Personnel will not be actively reduced. (1) A communication mechanism will be established for the treatment of junior officials. The bureau and section chiefs accepted this compromise because (1) the permanent retirement fund is guaranteed by the Railway Minister, (1) compensation will not be reduced, (1) 10% of the anticipated bonuses will be saved and included in railway accounting, and (1) the surplus from the salary reduction will still be added to the compensation.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: The railway personnel who were still dissatisfied with the compromise held a committee meeting upon hearing that the Cabinet had passed the salary reduction plan, seeking to withdraw the salary reduction plan. Some shouted for a general strike, and the situation deteriorated again.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: Although the Railway Ministry has calmed down due to the compromise, the attitude of various provinces towards the salary reduction has become even worse. In particular, the Ministry of Communications and Industry, because the Railway Ministry's compromise was backed by special accounting, deceived officials belonging to general accounting and were very angry. Currently, all section chiefs of the Ministry of Communications have submitted resolutions stating that they will not be responsible for any accidents that occur in the future to the bureau chiefs. Bureau chiefs have also decided to join the salary reduction opposition movement. Employees have issued instructions to the heads of first and second class post offices across the country regarding the worst-case scenario, that is, if the government insists on implementing the salary reduction, all communications employees across the country will strike together.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: Bureau chiefs and other high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry expressed opposition to the salary reduction and have collected resignation letters. Today, seeing that the salary reduction plan was about to be passed by the Cabinet, they have not been working since morning, in fact having started a general strike. Representatives met with Minister of Commerce and Industry Sakurauchi, demanding that salaries or compensation be increased first as a condition for acknowledging the salary reduction; otherwise, there would be a general strike.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: Seven hundred officials of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry passed a resolution opposing the salary reduction, and if it is implemented, they plan to resign. Army and Navy officers have kept silent, but it is said that they have now also resolved to petition against the salary reduction.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: The National Village and Town Head Representatives Meeting was held at Akasaka Sankodo at 10:30 this morning to discuss the officials' salary reduction plan. Some felt that limiting the salary reduction to those with monthly salaries of 100 yuan or more was still too lenient and advocated for a more active salary reduction. The meeting then resolved that the government should urgently carry out administrative and financial reorganization and that the extent of the officials' salary reduction should be adjusted to the actual situation of local officials so as not to lose balance. This resolution will be sent to Prime Minister Wakatsuki. A statement was also issued as follows: It is urgent to carry out administrative and financial reorganization and reduce the burden on the people in order to achieve social balance. The 11,000 village and town heads across the country petitioned both houses of the Diet in February of this year to reduce the burden. The government is currently seeking to realize this concretely, which is the common hope of the whole country. In this era of plummeting prices and financial obstruction, the salaries of local autonomous organizations' officials and primary school teachers have already been reduced in substance. The nation, which acknowledged a 70% salary increase during the prosperous era, is now in this difficult situation, knowing that all civil servants will willingly accept the salary reduction. All countries in the world have already reduced salaries, so the government has no need to hesitate about a decisive salary reduction.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Japan Increases Troops in Korea <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Nominally to Prevent Extremism</p>
<p>Actually with Other Intentions</p>
<p>Hope Countrymen Prepare Early</p>
<p>Tokyo News: The Japanese Ministry of the Army convened a meeting of senior officers at the Minister's official residence from the 17th to the 19th of this month and decided to increase troops in Korea. The reasons given by those who advocated for the increase in troops were roughly threefold: From a military perspective, heavy troops should be stationed in Korea to facilitate rapid transportation for war planning. This is the first reason. In recent years, the ideology of the colonies has tended towards extremism. There have been riots in various parts of Korea, and the Wushe massacre of Japanese residents in Taiwan. All of this is due to the weakness of the armed forces, which have failed to provide adequate protection. Therefore, in terms of colonial policy, troops should be increased in Korea. This is the second reason. In terms of military expenditure, the colonies should bear a considerable burden so that the mother country does not bear an excessive burden. This is the third reason. According to these three reasons, the second and third items are related to Japanese colonial policy, and we have nothing to add. However, the meaning of the first reason is that our country is the hypothetical enemy for a war against our Northeast. It is undeniable. The Japanese already have visible and invisible troops stationed in the Northeast (the invisible troops are the youth corps and Japanese residents who have received military training). Not satisfied, they are now taking further steps to increase troops in Korea. What is the purpose of this? Can the countrymen not thoroughly realize this and rise up to prepare? (World)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Zhang Xueliang Arrives in Beiping from Tianjin <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Guangmu Discusses No Meeting of Northern Generals</p>
<p>The Two Kong and Zhang Young Masters Are Not Formally Engaged</p>
<p>Cultural Guidance Committee Will Not Be Established Until Li Arrives</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Deputy Commander Zhang flew from Nanjing to Tianjin a few days ago for a short rest. Then, at 3:00 PM on the 22nd, he ordered preparations to be made to come to Beiping. At 4:00 PM, he left his private residence in the French Concession by car to the East Railway Station. After crossing the Wanguo Bridge, he traveled west along the Special Third District Main Road, passing through the Special Second District, crossing the East Floating Bridge, Jingang Road, Dajing Road, Huangwei Road, and turning onto the Jingping Highway to Beiping. Those who came to Beiping with Zhang included Zhu Guangmu, Chief of the General Affairs Office of the Headquarters; Tang Guozhen, Chief of the Adjutant Office; Ye Bilang, Chief of the Secretariat; Huang Xiansheng, Chief of the Liaoning Provincial Police Department; Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the Pingjin Garrison; Bao Yulin, Director of the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau; Zhang's two young masters; and more than twenty guards and adjutants, traveling in a total of eight cars. All the important figures of Beiping Municipality welcomed them outside Chaoyangmen East Bridge. At 6:40 PM, the cars arrived and drove through the East Bridge without stopping and headed towards the city. The first car was filled with guards to clear the way. The second car was carrying Tang Guozhen and others. The third car carried Zhang's two young masters. The fourth car, number 582, carried Deputy Commander Zhang and Zhu Guangmu. The remaining four cars carried Zhang's attendants, guards, and police escorts sent from Tianjin. After Zhang entered the city, he went directly to his private residence in Xinjian Hutong. Because he was tired from the journey, he did not see any guests who came to visit. Zhu Guangmu received them on his behalf. Zhu's remarks are recorded as follows: "I cannot say for sure how long Deputy Commander will stay in Beiping. The rumor that he will convene a meeting of North China generals in Beiping is not true. I do not know about the central government's handling of the Guangdong matter. Chairman Chiang will not come north for the time being. Director Gao Jiyi returned to Tianjin with Deputy Commander this time. The rumor that the central government will give Gao the position of Minister of Railways and that Secretary-General Wang (Shuhan) will be appointed as President of the Executive Yuan is also untrue. The report that Minister Kong (Xiangxi)'s young master and Deputy Commander's young lady were engaged by Chairman Chiang serving as matchmaker is true that the parents of both parties introduced the two at Nanjing but they have not been formally engaged." Zhu also said that Shi Yousan occasionally sends telegrams reporting on the situation of his troops and plans to come to Beiping soon to pay his respects to the Deputy Commander. After this long period of proof concerning the actions of Shi's troops, the previous rumors can be dispelled without attacking them. The story that Shi's troops were given an additional 100,000 yuan in funds is also untrue. Chairman Shang has just returned to Shanxi and may not be able to come to Beiping for the time being. The rumor that Deputy Commander brought back 1 million yuan in military funds for Jin-Sui is completely false. We can make a slight judgment on the matter of the transfer of a certain provincial chairman and prove that it is a false rumor. Because Deputy Commander is busy with affairs in Beiping, he will not be able to attend the North China Games held in Jinan. Madam Zhang has already returned north from Nanjing and is expected to arrive in Tianjin today or tomorrow. It is not certain whether she will come to Beiping. The reorganization of the Cultural Guidance Committee is currently being actively prepared. The date of establishment can only be determined after Mr. Li Shizeng and several other key personnel arrive in Beiping. The results of Director Shen Nengyi's negotiations on stamp issues in Nanjing are not clear to me and may be delayed for a few more days." (24th)</p>

Simultaneously, two bandits, Liu Baixiang and Zhang Haiqing, were executed at the entrance of the Lao Pu Amusement Park for crimes of forming gangs to rob and injure people. The charges were announced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) According to a report submitted by Su Yaozeng, Battalion Commander of the Gendarmerie Battalion of the 48th Division of the Army, three robbers, Shen Xuezhong, Wei Youyun, and Pan Dexue, were apprehended at No. 12, Mofan New Village, Hankou. A stolen automatic pistol, a forged commission, and six confessions were seized. After repeated trials and joint hearings by the Department, it was concluded that the criminals had formed a large gang last year, wielding firearms to rob the firearms of the Xingu Guard Corps and kidnapped ticket holders inside the oil pressing workshop, dividing the spoils. They later hid in Hankou, colluding with the pseudo-Independent First Brigade, obtaining a platoon leader's commission as a way to conceal their crimes. They also privately possessed firearms with the intention of disturbing public safety. The relevant persons involved in the case testified, and the criminals confessed to the above-mentioned crimes without denial, which are truly unforgivable. According to Article 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, the crimes should be pronounced separately, and the example of combining crimes according to criminal law should be used, and they should each be sentenced to death to serve as a warning.</p>
<p>(2) According to the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau, robbers and murderers Liu Baixiang and Zhang Haiqing were sent to the Department. After repeated trials, they confessed that they had formed a gang to steal, breaking into Zhang Hongxing's residence to rob clothes, and were caught on the spot. They then used knives to inflict six wounds on the victim's head, right arm, and underarm, etc. They did not deny this. The victim, Zhang Cai, was also summoned to court and testified that the criminals robbed and injured her husband, which was very dangerous, and there was a hospital diagnosis report as evidence. It is indeed true that with such strict security in Wuhan, these criminals dared to deliberately rob and injure people, and the crimes are serious. According to the law, they should all be sentenced to death to serve as a warning. (May 25)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Japanese Mass Selling Narcotics in Manchuria <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>There are Sixty Drug Shops in Anta</p>
<p>Translated by the World News Agency from the Miller's Review: The April 18th issue of this newspaper (Miller's Review) published a letter from an American woman living in the three eastern provinces, describing the situation of Japanese and Koreans privately selling opium and other drugs in Manchuria. Now, we have received further evidence related to this matter from the same American woman, which are photos of two coffins. The burial clothes of the dead in the coffins were stolen by drug addicts in order to buy opium, morphine, heroin, etc. There are two coffins in the photos, one has been buried, and the other is parked in the house, both of which were stolen by opium addicts. The corpse in one of the coffins was even bitten by dogs. There is a Japanese cemetery near the Chinese cemetery, which has also encountered the same theft. The gate and fence have been lost, and the thieves are all poor people addicted to drugs in the local area. The morphine and opium they need are all bought from Japanese and Koreans.</p>
<p>These two photos were taken in Anta, not far west of Harbin. The correspondent found that there were 60 shops opened by Japanese and Koreans in the area, all openly selling opium, morphine, heroin, and other addictive drugs. According to the correspondent, "I personally went to several pharmacies to seek confirmation. There are small holes in the doors, and buyers must inquire through the holes. I used the same method and asked for opium or morphine. The people in the shop asked how much I wanted and gave me the price, and then handed over the goods. These shops are known to everyone, and even children on the street can lead customers to sell them. I found that Anta has a hospital that claims to treat morphine addiction, but in fact, it is a place to inject morphine. The house is equipped with many beds. All the addicted men and women buy morphine from them, inject it, and then lie on the beds to relieve their addiction. When the addiction is over, these patients have to beg or steal on the street to prepare for another treatment. The result of this situation is naturally rampant crime. Many Chinese soldiers also use morphine and privately sell their guns and military uniforms to get money to buy drugs. In these places, residents dare not go out on the streets after sunset, fearing that they will be robbed by "opium thieves." Manchuria is in economic downturn, and many people are suffering, so they smoke opium to pass the time. When their family property is exhausted, they become beggars or bandits, or parasites on society and a burden to the public."</p>
<p>Anta is the center of drug distribution along the western section of the Middle East Railway, so the situation is the worst. However, along the entire 1,300-mile line of the Middle East Railway, there is hardly a city or town that is not filled with drug shops of Japanese and Koreans. Most of these shops have tall buildings, which shows the prosperity of their business. One small town has eight Japanese drug stores. After sunset, robbers appear on the streets, all of whom are impoverished and rogue because of smoking opium. In one place, half of the population is addicted to drugs. According to the director of the Chinese Post Office, Japanese and Korean drug traffickers use the Japanese Post Office in the South Manchurian Railway zone to send drugs. When they leave the area, they send special messengers to various points along the Middle East Railway. If the Chinese authorities arrest them, the Japanese consul immediately protests, and the Chinese side has to release them.</p>
<p>There is a piece of news that is directly related to this issue. According to the Kobe English Chronicle on May 6, detectives from the Osaka Police Department arrested a Japanese man and found that a drug trafficking group was active in Osaka and Dalian. On the night of April 30, the Osaka police searched a local residence and confiscated cocaine and morphine worth 1 million Japanese yen. This batch of smuggled goods was smuggled from Europe to Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian, and then transported to Kobe and Osaka in Japan. More than a dozen Japanese businessmen (including one in Dalian) were arrested in connection with this case. We deeply hope that the significance of this case will awaken the Japanese bureaucrats, because this case clearly shows that the Japanese drug trade in Manchuria has begun to counterattack Japan. The import of large quantities of drugs from Dalian into Japan is inevitable. This matter is also related to the United States, because Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian are also hubs for the import of opium, morphine, and other narcotics into the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Zhalainuoer Coal Mine Has Been Restored <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Only 70,000 to 80,000 Tons of Coal Are Allowed to Be Produced Annually</p>
<p>Most of the Coal Used by the Railway Is Still Purchased from Russia</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The issue of the restoration of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine has been resolved after the Middle East Railway Bureau submitted a plan to the Board of Directors for deliberation. The budget proposed by the Bureau was approved, and 500,000 rubles were allocated for restoration. However, after the restoration, the production limit is about 70,000 to 80,000 tons per year. The railway locomotives use about 200,000 tons of coal per year, half of which still needs to be purchased from the Suchang Coal Mine in Russia, and a three-year contract will be renewed. According to the Russian directors, the reason is that the Suchang coal has more oil and stronger firepower, and it is more durable than the coal produced by the Zha Mine. It is suitable for railways, and it is not suitable to use Zha Mine coal alone. Moreover, it is feared that the production will not be able to meet the needs when it is restored suddenly. After the case was decided, the Railway Bureau allocated 130,000 rubles to start the restoration first, and then allocated funds in succession until 500,000 rubles were allocated. Recently, the Chinese Mining Director Ding Tao has gone to the mining area to recruit old miners to plan work, and coal can be produced by mid-July at the latest. However, now our Chinese directors still advocate allowing the Zha Mine to produce as much coal as possible. In addition to the railway's annual use of 70,000 to 80,000 tons, the surplus is operated by the mining director and entrusted to merchants in Haiman area for resale, so that the people can buy it. The selling price is limited to one-third higher than the labor cost. However, the Russian side has not agreed because it has a conspiracy to dump Russian coal in North China. Therefore, the restoration of the Zha Mine this time is actually of no benefit to us. As for the contract for the Middle East Railway to purchase Russian coal, it started on June 27, 1929, and the term is three years, that is, June 27, 1931. The first contract was for 450,000 tons, and the second contract was for 20,000 tons. 69,668 tons were delivered in 1929, 159,135 tons were delivered in 1930, and 31,200 tons were delivered this year. There is still a shortage of more than 210,000 tons. The second renewal of 20,000 tons was due to the Russian side's request that there was an obstacle in the Suchang mining area, please postpone the delivery until 1932. It has been approved by the Board of Directors. However, the 210,000 tons still owed this year must be delivered this year, but so far, half of it has not been delivered. Therefore, the Russian side changed its attitude and allowed the Zha Mine to restore in order to postpone the delivery of the coal owed by the Suchang Mine. (May 21)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Changhuai Boat Tax Implemented <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Shipping Office Has Started Work</p>
<p>Offices Will Also Be Set Up in Zhengyangguan and Downstream</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The newly established Provincial Shipping Management Office of Anhui Province established offices in Wuhu, Datong, Chaohe, and Bengbu after it was established in Anqing. The Bengbu office was established on the 10th of this month in the Yuelai Company in Hexia and started work today (24th). Boat owners are ordered to register in accordance with the regulations so that the tax can be collected. There are more than 10,000 sailing boats in Changhuai and more than a dozen small steamships, and boats in the Wohe River basin must also pay taxes in accordance with the regulations. The monthly income in the future will be substantial. However, according to Zhu Gongfu, director of the Bengbu Shipping Management Office, the Changhuai shipping tax collected by our office is two-thirds less than the previous boat tax. After paying the tax and obtaining a license, boat owners can travel smoothly within a period (three months is a period) or one month. Therefore, Changhuai shipping people are very happy to comply. Next month, the wages of the officers and soldiers of the Water Public Security Bureau will be temporarily paid by our office, but it is difficult to predict at this time whether it will be able to collect the budgeted amount of the bureau. The monthly expenses of the Water Public Security Bureau are 9,800 yuan. The Zhengyangguan Management Office will be established soon. Downstream of Changhuai, such as Wuhe and Yuyi, will also set up offices when necessary to facilitate contact, etc. In addition, the Ministry of Communications previously issued a notice that the regulations of the Anhui Provincial Shipping Management Office on banning small steamships conflicted with the ship registration promulgated by the National Government, and specially consulted the Anhui Provincial Government to instruct it to stop the implementation or amend it. It is now heard that the Provincial Government has approved the amendment by the Department of Civil Affairs. The Provincial Shipping Management Office currently has five shallow-water gunboats. Recently, two ships have been dispatched to Changhuai, and armed patrols are stationed on the ships, led by patrol officers, to patrol upstream and downstream at ordinary times to protect the shipping people.

<h3 id="e84">Jiangsu Agricultural Department Asks to Expand Sericulture <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Open a Model Silk Factory</p>
<p>Promote Sericulture in Jiangbei</p>
<p>Increase the Production of Original Seeds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines recently submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry regarding the development of the silk industry in Jiangsu Province, requesting a full solution. The document is as follows: "According to your Ministry's Order No. 290, this department submitted a memorial containing various problems that should be handled in Jiangsu Province, requesting assistance. The memorial stated that the model silk factory is a problem. At present, the silk industry in our country is declining day by day. Improvement and encouragement are indeed important plans. However, the funds should be raised by the province itself. If the funds are insufficient, the central government will provide subsidies so that a permanent organization can be established, otherwise, it will be like water without a source, which will not help the matter. After investigation, the silk industry in Jiangsu Province has always been well-developed, but it has been accustomed to following the old ways and has not thought about making improvements, resulting in a gradual decline in production. After the establishment of this department, special agencies have been set up one after another to carry out experiments and research on the silk industry, ban inferior silkworm eggs, manufacture original silkworm eggs, and propagate mulberry seedlings. The officials and people cooperate with the farmers, and the farmers' faith in improving silkworm eggs has deepened day by day, so the production has increased day by day, and the quality has gradually improved. This is indeed a good phenomenon in the silk industry in Jiangsu Province. However, all of this is actively focused on silkworm breeding, and less attention has been paid after the cocoons are formed. Therefore, there is no demonstration site for the reeling and improvement of raw silk, which is a major regret for the development of the silk industry. It is found that the quality of raw silk exported from our country is uneven and extremely sticky. Foreign customers are often disappointed, resulting in a decline in foreign trade day by day. The reason for this is that domestic manufacturers stick to old methods and do not make improvements. The technology is not trained, and the management is not organized. To make fundamental reforms, it seems that it is not enough to set up a demonstration site to achieve practical results. It is also found that the silk industry in Jiangsu has always focused on Jiangnan. In the future, the progress should be popularized in Jiangbei. I think that the poverty of farmers in Jiangbei is due to the fact that transportation and water conservancy in Jiangbei are not as good as in Jiangnan. However, sericulture is a sideline occupation of farmers, and there has been no overall plan to promote it in Jiangbei, which is also a major reason for their poverty. In fact, the climate and soil quality in Jiangbei are not unsuitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. Last year, this department attached a sericulture department to the Huaiyin Provincial Miscellaneous Grain Experiment Farm and reclaimed 200 mu of land from the original farmland to cultivate 200,000 mulberry seedlings first. It also wanted to establish an initial foundation for the silk industry in Jiangbei. All matters such as rewarding planting mulberry trees and setting up guidance should be actively handled. It is also found that in recent years, silkworm egg production farms have sprung up in Jiangsu Province. The source of their original seeds is mostly purchased from Japan. The quality is not carefully selected, and the road is far away, and there are often many inferior changes in the transfer and transportation. This year, this department has slightly expanded the equipment of the Provincial Original Silkworm Egg Manufacturing Institute in order to increase production. However, due to insufficient funds, it cannot be expanded as much as possible. The current production of original seeds is at most 15,000 sheets. If we do not find a way to promote it, it will be difficult to meet the supply and demand, let alone save the benefits of foreign overflow. The above three points are related to the lifeline of the silk industry in Jiangsu Province. Although the regular budget of the provincial treasury is sufficient to bear the cost, the temporary costs of opening a model silk factory, promoting sericulture in Jiangbei, and increasing the production of original seeds have to rely on the subsidy from your ministry. It is requested that the silk industry in Jiangsu be given more attention, and 500,000 yuan be allocated from the silk industry public debt, with 300,000 yuan to open a model silk factory, 120,000 yuan to promote sericulture in Jiangbei, and 80,000 yuan to expand the original seed manufacturing institute. All of these are limited to one time, and no further requests will be made in the future. If it is approved, a detailed plan and repayment method will be submitted for approval. Should it be handled, I hereby submit a document for your review and instructions."</p>

<p>The Second Battalion of the Fourth Security Regiment Set Out: The Second Battalion of the Fourth Security Regiment of Jiangsu Province was previously dispatched to Songjiang because of the rampant bandits in Songjin. The provincial government added the battalion to Songjiang and assigned it to the command of Cao, the commander of the Second Regiment, to assist in suppressing the bandits. Battalion Commander Sun Kaixun led the troops to garrison Shanyang in this county to search for and suppress the remaining bandits. Now that the banditry has been gradually quelled, the provincial order has been approved to be transferred back to the original defense. It is scheduled to leave for Yixing and Wuxi on the 26th night. Eight special trains have been prepared by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to transport them.</p>

<p>Lu Shaoji Committed Suicide Because He Was Despised by His Wife: Lu Shaoji, a 26-year-old man from Changqiao, a village in the north of Taicang, married Qu Xingrong, a woman from Qinghe Stone Bridge, outside the North Gate of this county, a few years ago through a matchmaker. After marriage, the relationship between the couple was fairly harmonious. After two years, Xingrong returned to Wuxi on the pretext of visiting her family and had an affair with A Pei, a waiter at the Wuxi Hotel on the road. They were like a couple. When her mother, Qu, saw this situation, she sent a letter to her son-in-law, Lu Shaoji, to come to Wuxi. At the Wuxi Hotel, she forced him to write a divorce agreement. Lu received 42 yuan and returned home. After Qu Xingrong had an affair with Yuan A Pei, they lived together in Xiang Lane next to the Old Opera House. Unexpectedly, the adulterous couple suddenly had a rift after a few months. Therefore, Qu thought of Lu Shaoji, who had divorced her. On the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month of the previous year, the woman's mother went to Taicang to report the matter and asked Lu to come to Wuxi for a meeting. Lu then came to Wuxi on the third day of the first lunar month of this year with his luggage. His mother-in-law, Qu, entrusted the hostess of the Xinghua Village Restaurant in Tantou Lane to recommend him to the Xie Xing Mountain Goods Store under the Dajiao Bridge as a partner with a monthly salary of four yuan. Unexpectedly, Xingrong's romantic nature made her think that her husband's income was not enough for her to spend. Therefore, there were frequent quarrels between the couple. Xingrong then thought of another pipa.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Xu Xiaoyuan, a waiter at Xinghua Village, acted as a matchmaker and said that she would marry Huang Qiugen, a waiter at the same restaurant, and the wedding was scheduled for June 12. Recently, Lu Shaoji was suddenly dismissed from the store and despised by his wife Xingrong, which made him feel angry and resentful. He suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. He cleaned up everything and went to Room 6 on the upper floor of the Xintianbao Hotel under the Jixiang Bridge at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday, using the alias Lu Guixi. At about 1:00 am that night, he wrote a farewell letter and then poured two boxes of opium he had bought into a teacup, mixed it with match heads, and secretly swallowed it. At 10:00 am yesterday, Xu Rongchang, a waiter at the hotel, noticed that Lu's expression was very different and he was unconscious. He immediately reported to the accountant and sent him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's rescue, he regained consciousness and his life may be safe.</p>
<p>Rice and Bean Industry Asks for Exemption from Business Tax: The Wuxi Rice and Bean Industry Association previously received repeated letters from the Chamber of Commerce transferring the Business Tax Bureau, urging the collection of business tax. It then convened a meeting of all colleagues, who all agreed that each industry was acting as an agent for customers and had paid ya tie tax, so business tax could not be collected again. Special points of view: (1) Jiangsu Province intends to change the collection of business tax and should start from the special cities of Jinghu and Zhenjiang first. Wuxi is one of the inland counties and cannot start the collection first. (2) The rice and bean colleagues have paid the ya tie tax. The Jiangsu Department of Finance previously submitted a memorial to the Provincial Government proposing that after the business tax is changed, the education special fund, ya tie tax, and slaughter tax will be allocated and still managed by the Education Management Office as before. It is clearly stated that the business tax and the ya tax cannot be mixed. (3) The ya tie tax paid by the rice and bean merchants is completely paid by the customers and is the medium of commerce. All customers' goods, whether wholesale, retail, or zero, are agents. How can it be said that it is self-selling? Therefore, after the ya tie tax is collected, business tax cannot be collected again. (4) Jiangsu Province will of course cancel the ya tie tax when it implements business tax, and then change the collection of business tax to avoid conflicts, which is fair. The above points have been sent to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday to transfer to the Business Tax Bureau and telegraphed to the Provincial Department to appeal for the suffering of the Jiangsu merchants.</p>

<p>All Circles Telegraphically Requested the Removal of the Wounded Soldiers Factory: All circles in Nantong opposed the Eleventh Division stationed in Han setting up a wounded soldiers factory in Tong. On the 25th, the business community resumed business after being persuaded by the county government. The county party department has telegraphed the province for instructions on whether to approve the opening of a citizens' assembly. Local groups telegraphed General Commander Jiang, saying that the Eleventh Division had been ordered by the Ministry to negotiate with the representatives of the county, but the division did not wait for the negotiation to be completed. The wounded soldiers and guards were suddenly transported to the factory and forced the poor people to leave, causing anger among all circles and leading to a strike. Please telegraph to order the division to leave Tong if it has already come and to stop coming if it has not yet come to appease the people. Another telegram to Luo Zhuoying, commander of the division in Hankou, said that your division had been ordered by the headquarters to negotiate with the representatives of the county to set up a wounded soldiers factory in Tong. Director Zhuang forcibly occupied the factory and forced the poor people to leave without negotiation, causing anger among all circles and leading to a strike. Therefore, a special telegram was sent to request that the public opinion be considered and that the factory be quickly ordered to leave Tong to find another site to appease the people. Commander Luo telegraphed the county government on the 25th, asking for investigation and reply on the real situation of the preparatory personnel arguing with the local people.</p>

After receiving the presentation, the Finance Department stated that the collection of busy Cao should be based on the actual autumn survey. The ticket of the 19th year grain series of Suining was actually collected at six and six li. How could County Magistrate Guo collude with the counter clerk to increase six li privately, and since the amount of grain to be collected has increased, it should of course be included in the quota for collection, and why should it be retained for personal gain? In addition to the approval, the Finance Department sent inspectors to conduct a thorough investigation for verification.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau of Northern Cixi was Smashed by Villagers: Some time ago, the San Tai grocery store in the Shen Shi Bridge area of northern Cixi county reported a theft to the Northern Cixi Public Security Bureau. The bureau dispatched police to investigate, and they happened to witness a gambling game at the home of Mr. Ye, a neighbor of the store. The police took the gamblers into custody, but they were seized by a crowd of nearby residents. The police returned to the bureau and reported the incident. The bureau chief then sent additional police officers, along with the security team stationed in northern Cixi, to arrest the residents. Seeing the soldiers and police arriving, the local residents beat gongs and drums to gather a crowd of over a thousand people, who refused to be arrested on the spot and rushed to the branch bureau in a swarm, causing a riot and smashing all the bureau's equipment and belongings. The security team and others were unable to stop them, so they opened fire, and the crowd dispersed and fled. One person was wounded in the shooting.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Losing to East-West by Four Points Again <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>34 to 30</p>
<p>Returning North This Morning, First to Nanjing</p>
<p>The Tianjin Black and White basketball team competed in Shanghai last night in their final match against the East-West team. After a hard-fought 40 minutes, they suffered their second defeat by a margin of four points, with a score of 34 to 30. The team is scheduled to return north this morning, first to Nanjing for a competition. A brief account of the match follows.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Exhausted After Four Consecutive Battles <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Although the Black and White basketball team had two wins and two losses in their four games in Shanghai, their strength is undeniable. Tang Baokun, as well as Huang Yuanqing and Shen Yucong, all have the potential for further development. The whole team is still young, with Baokun being the oldest and the rest under twenty. With continued effort and progress in the next one or two years, they will become invincible. The final two defeats were tough on the team, but Black and White had been fighting hard for days, while their opponents were fresh and rested, giving them an advantage.</p>
<h3 id="e97">East-West at the Height of Their Power <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The East-West lineup was first-class in Shanghai. Center Chen Xianglong has become more confident than before and made the most contributions yesterday. Wing players Ouyang and Xiao Liang are well-known, and guards Wang Xiliang and Lu Zhongen defended the backcourt fiercely. The five players cooperated tightly and exceptionally well, making the match a close contest. Black and White's loss by only four points is commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Black and White Unlucky with the Smallest of Margins <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Referee Shao Ji gave the order to start the game at 8:30. East-West took the offensive with a fierce attack. Li Qingyun of Black and White committed a foul, and Xiao Liang scored a free throw, opening the scoring for East-West. Huang Yuanqing scored a long shot for Black and White, making it 2-1. The lead changed hands, and the score was tied at 5-5. With the difference being only one or two points, Shen Yuqin made several long shots, but the ball repeatedly missed the basket by a fraction of an inch. Throws under the basket also failed to go in. With bad luck, the first half ended with Black and White trailing 14-19.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Little Tang Shows Great Power and Skill <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, East-West scored several consecutive points, while Black and White continued to struggle, and the score gap widened to 30-20. Tang Baokun was then switched to forward, changing from defense to offense in the hope of turning the tide. Black and White lost a defender when Tang attacked, and they lost an attacker when Tang defended. This was their downfall. As soon as Little Tang came to the front, he made a ground shot, which was met with loud applause from the audience. He scored two consecutive long shots, earning a total of eight points. Black and White was only two points behind. Little Tang's skill was admirable, but he was later switched back to defense, making it impossible to turn the tide, and they ultimately lost 34-30.</p>

<p>The Black and White team is scheduled to return north this morning, first to visit the capital, as they are exhausted from several days of hard fighting. Competitions in Nanjing are uncertain. The overall record of the four games in Shanghai is as follows:</p>
<p>Vs. Shanghai University  28-25  Black and White Wins</p>
<p>Vs. St. John's  425-24  Black and White Wins</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the Four Universities competition, the Jinling University track and field team took advantage of their stay in Shanghai to compete against the American Boys' School on Avenue Petain. Jinling, with a tired team after the competition, faced a rested team, so it was not surprising that they lost both the track and field events. In the field events, the American school scored 28 points, and Jinling scored 17 points. In the track events, the American school scored 35 points, and Jinling scored 19 points.</p>

At the time, it was considered a major matter, and it was decided to submit it to the Competition Committee for handling. Only three of the seven members of the Competition Committee were in Jinan: Li Wenchang, Shang Shumei, and Zhang Yixian, which was less than half. They contacted the other four members, Zhang Boling, Yuan Dunli, Hao Gengsheng, and Shou Yi, to seek their consent. Today, replies have been received from Hao and Dong, fully agreeing to the change in the competition rules. This matter has now been approved by a majority of the Competition Committee.</p>

If this is done, the Games will be a complete success.</p>

All important figures from the Shandong provincial government, party, and military attended, and Jin Yun'e and representatives from the gentry and business communities, such as He Chunjiang, Ma Liang, and Xin Zhu, were also invited as guests. The atmosphere was extremely jovial. First, Han Fuqu stood up and gave a speech, saying that he was an outsider to sports and didn't have much knowledge about it, but after returning from the National Conference in Nanjing, he saw that the preparations for the North China Games were generally very good and complete, and everyone had worked very hard. The most important thing now is the hospitality. Since the Games are being held in Shandong, we are the hosts, and the guests are coming to us. We should always let them come and go in high spirits and not disappoint them. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard with the same spirit as before and pay special attention to hospitality. Next, Zhang Honglie, the vice-chairman and director of the Department of Construction, reported on the supplementary measures for groups entering the venue, and Yang Peng, the director of the hospitality section, reported on the detailed hospitality measures, stating that the responsibility for hospitality lies with those responsible for the venue. Hospitality has already been 90% successful, and he hoped that everyone would work hard to complete it. Anyone who sees anything that can be improved can raise it at any time. Next, Jin Yun'e gave a speech, generally hoping that sports would make universal progress. Finally, He Siyuan, the director of the Department of Education, gave a speech, saying that the Games could be divided into three parts: the engineering department, which has now been completed; the administrative department, which has been largely prepared; and the competition department, which has specialized personnel responsible for it. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard to ensure that the Games have a successful outcome from beginning to end. The banquet ended at 12:00 PM with great pleasure.</p>

<p>Zhang Boling Encourages Athletes</p>
<p>Jinan, 26th: Han hosted a banquet for all athletes and referees in two batches today and arranged for a theatrical performance. Han gave a speech, expressing his desire to take the opportunity to talk to all the brothers and sisters, but due to a toothache, he asked Vice-Chairman Zhang to give a speech on his behalf, apologizing for any inadequate hospitality and asking them to report any difficulties they encounter. He stated that the strength of the country depends on the strength of the people's bodies. Later, Li Jinglin performed Taijiquan and Wudang sword. Zhang Boling gave a response, saying that the spirit of this session is better than the previous one because the whole country is promoting sports. The foundation stone for the National Games venue was laid on May 10th, and Jiang gave a speech emphasizing sports. Chairman Han is also doing the same, which proves that the whole country is paying attention to sports. He asked the athletes to pay attention to morality and responsibility, to boost their spirits, and to wash away the stigma from the National Conference. Finally, all the athletes bowed to Han and Zhang, took a photo, and then went to tour the Pearl Spring.</p>
<h3 id="e121">No Admission Fee <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The original plan was to charge ten cents per ticket for admission to the North China Games, but this was later reduced to one cent. It was recently decided to waive the admission fee. It is said that the printed admission tickets will be distributed temporarily at the venue, with one ticket given to each person until all tickets are gone.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Comments from Team Leaders <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Gu Yuqi, the leader of the Henan team, said that his team departed from Kaifeng at 1:00 PM on the 23rd and arrived in Jinan yesterday by train from Xuzhou. The athletes were selected from more than ten schools, including Henan University, Senior High School, No. 1 Middle School, No. 1 Normal School, Liming Middle School, Lianghe Middle School, and Mining University. Wang Zipei, the leader of the Chahar team, said that most of the schools in Chahar Province are middle schools, and sports are underdeveloped. Fortunately, Chairman Liu pays great attention to sports, and the future is promising for sports development. Although the sports results are not good, they still came to participate to promote sports. He felt interested in the football and basketball games he participated in in Beiping, so he came to see them this time. Zhang Jiwu, the leader of the Tianjin team, said that the preparations for this session by the preparatory committee were very thorough and satisfactory, and because the government is in charge, participants from various places are very enthusiastic. The Tianjin team's ball game results are better than the track and field results, but he dare not say that he is confident. More than twenty athletes could not come to participate because they were busy with their studies, and those who were working in various companies could not spare the time.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Grand Send-off for Liaoning Athletes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>(Fast Mail from Fanyang, 23rd) The 135 male and female athletes from Liaoning attending the North China Games departed from the Beining Road on the 23rd of this month. The team leader is Cui Litang, an inspector from the Department of Education, and the general secretary is Zhang Tieshan. The team leaders and instructors are Wang Lan, Song Junfu, Bu Qi, Gu Zizhong, Liu Weiying, and two ladies, He Fengxian. At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, Jin Yufu, the director of the Department of Education, summoned all the athletes to the Provincial Education Association to give a speech, encouraging the students to work hard and strive for Liaoning's honor. He also emphasized the importance of respecting sportsmanship and adhering to the rules, not forgetting politeness in competition. At 8:00 AM the next morning (the 23rd), all the athletes, except for those from Fengyong University who boarded the train at the Japanese station, gathered at the Liaoning General Station to take roll call and board the train. The Beining Road had specially allocated two third-class passenger cars with white paper strips reading "Liaoning North China Athletes Special Car" attached. Each athlete also wore a white bamboo cloth strip reading "Liaoning North China Athlete" on their chest. Everyone was busy carrying luggage and sports equipment. On that day, staff members and teachers from educational institutions and schools in Shenyuan, as well as reporters from various newspapers, came to the station to see them off. The students from the Provincial Women's Normal School also held small flags with the words "Work Hard, Add Oil" and "Win the Championship" written on them. The athletes were all energetic and cheerful, and the platform was quite lively. At 9:50 AM, the athletes' special car departed westward in the cheers of the crowd. Due to the fact that the provincial government only allocated 8,000 yuan for this participation in the North China Games, which was not enough in reality, the regulations for the athletes' food and accommodation are now such that one yuan in cash is issued per person per day. However, the athletes from Northeastern University are the most favored by the school, receiving a subsidy of ten yuan in cash per person as an encouragement. The school's student union also invited the athletes to a luncheon at the school's club at 7:30 AM on the 23rd to bid them farewell.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Handling Disputes in the Sand and Gravel Industry <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Ordered to Cancel Company Names and Stop Reckless Actions</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly received reports from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association stating that the sand and gravel industry in the city is contracted by two companies from Zhejiang Province, Dachang and Yitai. They frequently impose harsh taxes on sand and mud and use high-pressure tactics such as detaining goods and people, leading to a city-wide shutdown. They requested that measures be taken to mediate to avoid escalating unrest and affecting commerce. The bureau immediately reported the situation to the Municipal Government and forwarded it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for verification. After investigation by the bureau, it was confirmed to be true. It was also found that the two tax-contracting companies, Dachang and Yitai, had not registered and falsely claimed to be companies, which violated Article 18 of the General Rules for Merchants. Furthermore, the Zhejiang contractors arbitrarily set up checkpoints in the city to collect taxes, infringing on the administrative authority of the city, and also detained goods and people, leading to strikes, which had a significant impact on the construction industry and the livelihoods of laborers. This should be corrected to prevent the escalation of unrest. Therefore, in addition to ordering the two companies, Dachang and Yitai, to cancel their company names before registering, a document was submitted to the Municipal Government to order the Public Security Bureau to instruct the districts under its jurisdiction to strictly stop any detention of goods and people to prevent disputes and ensure commercial stability.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau's Approval: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday approved the Sand and Gravel Industry Association's request to stop the levying of sand and mud production and sales taxes. Both reports have been received, and the Municipal Government has been requested to order the Public Security Bureau to instruct its subordinates to stop it. This is the approval.</p>
<p>Boatmen's Statement: Yao Wencan and other boatmen from the Shaoxing Sailboat Office submitted a report to the Supervisory Yuan yesterday, stating that they are requesting an investigation into the fabricated names, deceptive rhetoric, contracting, and disguised likin-like sand and mud management fees that are being levied arbitrarily and severely burdening merchants, in order to warn against imitation and stabilize commerce. Yao Wencan and other boatmen specialize in transporting sand and mud. In the past, when collecting sand and mud from Ningbo and other places, they paid a land price of 22 cents per ton and also paid education donations and police fees. The selling price in Shanghai was 2.1 yuan per ton. They risked the dangers of wind and waves with their hard work to earn meager profits to make a living. However, recently, Wu Yousan and others, the principals of the two companies Dachang and Yitai, disregarded the livelihoods of our boat industry and contracted for harsh taxes from the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, using deceptive rhetoric and fabricated names, calling it a "management fee." Initially, the fee was 1 yuan per ton, but due to public anger and disagreement, it was changed to 70 cents per ton. They also set up checkpoints at important passes in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality to levy donations and threatened in various ways. Yao Wencan and others are all poor boat merchants who cannot bear this heavy burden. Moreover, sand and mud are a kind of waste material used to benefit people, and the boatmen's transportation can dredge rivers. There is no need for management. It is not necessary for the bureau to manage the sand and mud that is used as waste material to implement the State Council's policy of showing consideration for the difficulties of merchants and abolishing likin. The contracting system has long been abolished. How can this kind of sand and mud management fee, which is a disguised form of likin and taxes goods, not only violate the political program but also go against the original intention of abolishing likin? Furthermore, the contracting of this tax by the two companies Dachang and Yitai is a disregard for government orders. Wencan and others are forced to present this urgent report due to livelihood concerns. We sincerely request your inspection and ask you to severely investigate and deal with it in order to warn against imitation and stabilize commerce. We respectfully request your approval and are extremely grateful. Respectfully presented to the Supervisory Yuan of the National Government by Yao Wencan, Fu Dingsen, Yao Yongtai, and other boatmen from the Shaoxing Sailboat Office.</p>
<p>Construction Industry's Telegram: The Shanghai Construction Industry Association telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the issue of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province levying sand and mud donations and the shutdown of the sand and gravel industry, requesting a prompt abolition to stabilize commerce. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respectfully submitted, since the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province increased the sand and mud donation, the sand and gravel industry unanimously went on strike on May 19th to resist. Although they were persuaded to resume work by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Sand and Gravel Association, the suffering of the merchants will not be relieved until these harsh taxes are abolished. Our association and the sand and gravel industry are interdependent and share the same pain. If these harsh taxes are not abolished soon, causing a second strike, it will inevitably affect the livelihoods of more than 100,000 workers in our industry. Therefore, we urgently request the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to promptly forward this to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for abolition to stabilize commerce. This would be a great service.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Butchers Opened for Business Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Demanding the Abolition of the Technician Inspection Fee</p>
<p>Establishing a Public Welfare Fund Committee</p>
<p>After mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the issue of the municipal slaughter tax, the fresh meat industry resumed importing goods and opened for business yesterday. Yesterday, the butchers from the four suburban districts demanded the abolition of the technician inspection fee and the prompt establishment of a public welfare fund committee. The situation yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening for Business: After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce resolved the slaughter tax issue two days ago and decided on two solutions, the fresh meat industry prepared to import goods and open for business. Xuejia浜 and Nan Gong宰作 in the southern district of Shanghai slaughtered more than 360 fresh pigs the night before yesterday. Fresh meat was available in the southern district of Shanghai yesterday, and residents, who had not eaten meat for a long time, rushed to buy meat after hearing that it had opened for business. The stores were very crowded and all were sold out by the afternoon. The Hubbei Slaughterhouse on Minli Road in the northern district of Shanghai slaughtered more than 200 fresh pigs last night, and the slaughterhouses in the four suburban districts slaughtered more than 200 fresh pigs. Fresh meat will also be available this morning.</p>
<p>Technician Inspection Fee: The monthly technician inspection fee paid by the fresh meat industry in the four suburban districts is 170 yuan for the seven locations of Yangjing, Yangjiadu, Tangqiao, Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Zhenru, and Jiangwan, 150 yuan for Gaoqiao, and 75 yuan for Yinhang. Now that the slaughter tax issue has been resolved, the purchase of tickets at 39 cents per pig as stipulated by the municipal government has already increased the burden. However, the technician inspection fee has not been abolished. Since there is already a post-slaughter inspection fee, the technician fee is unnecessary. They have requested the industry association to submit a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forward it to the municipal government for abolition to ease the burden on merchants. It is reported that the association will submit a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forward it to the municipal government for abolition.</p>
<p>Public Welfare Funds: The fresh meat merchants in the north and south of Shanghai and the four suburban districts demanded that the industry association promptly establish a public welfare fund management committee and explain the purpose and amount of the funds so that they can be made public, as the amount of public welfare funds allocated by the municipal government from tax revenue in the resolution method has not been determined.</p>
<p>Pigs Ships Arrive in Shanghai: After hearing that the slaughter tax issue had been resolved, Zhang Fuchen and other 1,326 pig merchants from Jiangbei telegraphed various places in Jiangbei to load pigs and send them to Shanghai as soon as possible. Seven pig ships arrived the day before yesterday and six arrived yesterday, which is quite different from normal times.</p>
<p>Mining Federation</p>
<h3 id="e143">Appeal for Reduced Freight Rates <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The China Mining Federation, located at No. 38 Edward Road in Shanghai, recently submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry to appeal for relief from the increased freight rates on the Jiaoji, Jinpu, Pinghan, and Pingsui railways. The original manuscript of the document is found as follows: "Respectfully submitted to request the maintenance of low freight rates for domestic coal to save the mining industry and benefit the people. We respectfully request your approval and forwarding. The progress of industry depends entirely on power, and coal is the most important fuel for power. Low coal prices reduce production costs, industry is easier to develop, national productivity increases, and the people can benefit from it. China's coal deposits are extremely rich, but those operated purely with Chinese capital are mostly weak in financial resources. Even the larger mines only produce 2,000 to 3,000 tons per day, while mines operated with foreign capital are strong in financial resources and produce more than 10,000 tons per day. The disparity in strength is difficult to compete with. In addition, Chinese-funded coal mines have been on the verge of bankruptcy due to the impact of military affairs over the years, and coal prices have been soaring, causing the industrial sector to suffer from expensive fuel. There have been frequent calls for help. Now that military affairs have been quelled, the National Government is working hard to govern and renew the people. The Ministry of Railways convened a commercial transportation meeting to establish fair principles. All our merchants and people are grateful. The resolution principles of the commercial transportation meeting are as follows: (1) The freight rate for domestic coal per catty should be based on the lowest possible range of transportation costs for each railway and coal production costs and sales prices for each mine. There is also a resolution to convene a mining committee. If the government establishes an active relief and incentive policy for our country's mining industry and industry, which urgently need relief and incentives, even if the railway depreciates in value, it would not be excessive. However, the Mining Transportation Committee has not yet been convened, and how railway costs are calculated is still unclear to the public. The Jiaoji Railway suddenly issued an order to increase freight rates by 20% from May 1st, and the Jinpu, Pinghan, and Pingsui railways also issued an order to increase coal freight rates by 15% from May 1st. The mines of our federation are all panic-stricken. Moreover, the abolition of unequal treaties is the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. However, foreign coal still relies on its unequal treaties to enjoy the right to special reduced freight rates, while the freight rates for domestic coal are arbitrarily increased by various railways, which will inevitably destroy the mining industry operated with Chinese capital and curb the development of industry. We hope that your ministry will promote industry and be considerate of the difficulties of merchants in every possible way. We ask that you consider that the use of coal is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and allow us to forward this to the Ministry of Railways to order all railways to stop increasing coal transportation and quickly convene the Mining Transportation Committee for further deliberation.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Urging Fishermen to Form Fishermen's Associations Quickly <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Does Not Conflict with Fishery Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Department of Agriculture and Mines yesterday, stating that in order to comply with the Ministry of Industry's Order No. 11, the organization of fishermen's associations is to seek the common interests of fishermen and fish merchants, and to assist the government in fishery administration facilities, which is extremely important for the development of fisheries. Since the promulgation of the Fishermen's Association Law, few provinces in fishing areas have been organized and established in accordance with the law and reported to the ministry for record. This is not the intention of the national legislation to rectify the fishery industry. Hereafter, in areas where fishermen's associations have not been organized, the departments should instruct their subordinates to urge fishermen to organize them as soon as possible in order to work together to advance the fishery industry. In addition to separate orders, we hereby order the County Government to urge fishermen to organize fishermen's associations as soon as possible and report within two months of the arrival of this document for inspection. This is the order.</p>
<p>Another order stated that in order to comply with the Ministry of Industry's Order No. 1298, the Department telegraphed an inquiry as to whether fish merchants would still be allowed to form trade associations after joining the fishermen's association. The reply stated that after reading the telegram, Article 2 of the Implementing Rules for Trade Association Law is a general mandatory provision, and fish merchants are naturally not an exception. Moreover, the members of the fishermen's association are individuals, and the members of the trade association are companies. Since the two organizations are different and the qualifications for membership are also different, it is legally permissible for fish merchants to organize a trade association even after joining the fishermen's association. Please inform the County Government to inform the County Fishermen's Association and Fishery Organizations. This is the order.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Echoes of the Recovery of the French Concession's Court <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Organizations in the French Concession</p>
<p>Citizens' organizations in the French Concession telegraphed the government yesterday, stating: (Titles Omitted) Our government has decided to recover the French Concession's Court in order to unify jurisdiction, and all Chinese people are applauding. However, the French authorities hope to preserve their only position and interests in China through a policy of appeasement, especially regarding the French Concession's Joint Court. Since the Public Concession implemented the recovery of the Provisional Court, the French Concession's Court has automatically reorganized, and all civil and criminal cases involving Chinese people are tried by Chinese and French judges alone. However, the appointment of judges must still be approved by the French Consul-General. All judgments are accompanied by French consuls if they involve French lawyers, and Chinese lawyers who are not familiar with French cannot represent parties in court. All official documents are still mainly in French, and the name of the French Concession's Court remains the same. This kind of reorganization is actually empty. The Chinese people in our French Concession have suffered deeply from the Public Court, and for the sake of our own interests, we deeply admire the fundamental recovery and substantial reorganization advocated by the Ministry and pledge our support as citizens. We hope that the authorities will be decisive and unwavering, and we will not give up until the goal is achieved. We hereby submit this telegram and respectfully request your inspection and implementation. Sincerely, Representatives of the United Associations of the Nanyang Bridge, MinGuo Road, and Edward Road in the French Concession, Li Weiliang, Ye Ruizhai, Yan Liangsheng, and Tong Gongnu. It is also learned that the tenants' associations in the French Concession have sent telegrams to the government, with roughly the same content, which are omitted.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that experts from the New York Society for Religious Studies, both male and female, commissioned by the Foreign Missions Investigation Committee of Christian Believers, have arrived in Shanghai yesterday (25th) after being commissioned to investigate the missionary situation in China, Japan, and India.

This investigation is managed by Mr. Fisher and divided into three groups: China, Japan, and India.

The motivation is due to the fact that believers who have been donating funds for foreign missions want to know the truth about the work of American churches in China, Japan, and India, so they commissioned experts from the college to conduct a sympathetic investigation.</p>

<p>Dispute at the Datong Shipping Bureau: A Japanese man named Fuji Naga leased several ships, including the Dalong Maru, Hailong Maru, Pengyang Maru, and Fupu Maru, from Tanaka Trading Company in Japan to operate coastal routes in China. He established the Datong Shipping Company on Renji Road and appointed Zhuang as the Chinese manager. It is now reported by the Japanese-language newspaper Hebun that since the company's establishment, some individuals seeking to become ship stewards have contacted a certain Chinese person in the company and paid a deposit of 5,000 yuan. Now, because the ship has not arrived for a long time, those who paid the deposit are clamoring for the company to return their money, leading to a major dispute. The Japanese consulate has become aware of this matter and is secretly investigating it.</p>

<p>Suggestions from the Postal Workers' Union</p>
<h3 id="e160">People's Congress and Two Special Trade Union Laws <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the National Government for Reference</p>
<p>Notice to Members Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union issued a notice and informed all members, stating that the Special Trade Union Law is the fundamental legal issue of the union. Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, the union has followed the draft proposal of 54 articles from the Preparatory Committee of the National Postal Workers' General Union and submitted it to the Central Government for approval, but it has not yet been promulgated, leaving the union and all special trade unions with no guidance for their work. Therefore, during the National People's Congress, comrades Zhao Shusheng and Qi Jiamou were sent to Beijing to join representatives from the Nanjing Postal Workers' Union and the Jiangsu Telecommunications Workers' Union to urge the worker representatives attending the People's Congress to submit the draft to the presidium of the congress. The presidium submitted it to the Fourth Proposal Review Committee of the congress on the 13th. After Comrade Chen Wenbin (member of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Workers' Union) strongly advocated for it, the committee decided to pass the principles and submit them to the National Government for reference. At the Eighth Meeting of the Congress, Comrade Peng Jiqun, the convener of the Proposal Review Committee, formally proposed the Special Trade Union Law and the National Trade Union General Organization Bill, and the congress resolved to pass them and submit them to the National Government for reference and consideration. In the future, the Central Government will definitely comply with the resolutions of the National People's Congress and implement and promulgate the Special Trade Union Law in the shortest possible time, so that the union can follow it and continue to work hard for the revolution and construction, develop its affairs, consolidate its foundation, and look forward to a brighter future. It is hoped that all members will appreciate the union's continuous hard work, be of one heart and one mind, be loyal and consistent, cherish the union, and work hard. This is the notice.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Depressed Situation in Silk Factories <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Wage Restoration Unlikely to be on Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factories Association convened a meeting of all executive committee members at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai, Wu Shenbo, Huang Jinfan, and ten others. Chairman Shen Huachen presided over the meeting. First, Chairman Shen reported that the issue of the distribution of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds had been decided by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, with Mu Ouchu, Zou Bingwen, and Song Ziliang appointed as committee members to distribute the bond amount and manage the fund. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 29th of this month, and active preparations are urgently needed. Then, the committee discussed whether the wages of female workers could be restored to their original state. It was noted that this year's silkworm news in Jiangsu and Zhejiang had been severely affected by the weather. The cocoon production in Zhejiang was unusually poor, the cocoon quality was inferior, and the cocoon price was not cheap. In Jiangsu, most of the early and late silkworms died, and there was no hope for cocoon harvesting. Overseas silk sales still showed no signs of improvement, and silk prices were extremely low. The price of European and American Shanghai white silk factories was more than 400 taels different from the factory's cost, resulting in huge losses. Factories were unable to support themselves, and one-third of them had already shut down one after another. The more than 30 silk factories that are still operating are only temporarily maintaining the status quo. It is uncertain whether each factory will be able to continue working after the old cocoons are finished and the new cocoons are on the market, and how many silk factories in Shanghai will be open at that time. In short, the current foreign silk sales are so sluggish, and Japanese silk is being sold at low prices relentlessly. The factory price is small, and the cost is high. Even if the wages of each factory are not increased, it will be difficult to maintain them. The factories are facing so many difficulties and are all disheartened and negative. After a long time, no results were achieved, and the meeting was dismissed. It is feared that the restoration of the wages of female workers in Shanghai silk factories on June 1st will be difficult.</p>

<p>Cotton Cloth Reporting Industries</p>
<h3 id="e164">Responsibility for Dock Dues Collection and Payment <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is Scheduled to Convene a Discussion Today</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of responsibility for dock dues collection and payment in the cotton cloth reporting industries, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate and respond on customs. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce conducted a detailed investigation and reported that the dock dues should be borne by the merchants. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the report and ordered the three parties to coordinate and resolve the issue or contact each party separately to determine a proper solution and report it for review. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is currently scheduled to convene a discussion today (27th). The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Convocation Notice: Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, the Transportation Reporting Industry Association, the Sanshan Guild Hall, the Shanghai Merchants Association, the Shandong Guild Hall, and the Sichuan Merchants Association, stating that on May 22nd, a case was received from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau under number 10228, which opened an order to investigate and respond to the responsibility for dock dues collection and payment and requested review. The response was that the three parties should be convened to properly coordinate or contact each party separately to determine a proper solution and report it for review. Therefore, the three parties are scheduled to be convened at the association at 2:00 PM on May 27th to discuss and resolve the issue. A separate letter will be sent, and we respectfully request that you send representatives to attend on time.</p>
<p>Merchant Groups' Statement: Merchants from Andong, Longkou, Yantai, Dalian, Harbin, and other regions issued an important statement yesterday regarding the dock dues issue, stating that they have been purchasing and transporting cotton cloth to various provinces for more than 40 years. According to historical procedures, the dock dues, porterage fees, and other expenses are the responsibility of the owner of the goods. The merchants only know the market price and place orders accordingly, and have no need to be involved in other procedures. Furthermore, the freight owners have already added all expenses to the price of the goods. The power to increase or decrease prices rests with the freight owners. Now, it is forced upon the merchants to acknowledge the dock dues, which is tantamount to openly increasing and secretly taking, which is not only inconsistent with the facts but also contradicts historical procedures. The reporting industry is acting on behalf of the freight owners and has no reason to assume the responsibility. Although there are mediators mentioned in the newspapers, the truth is still unclear. Therefore, we are publishing this statement to clarify the responsibility of our business and the reasons for not being able to acknowledge the dock dues. We hope for clear understanding.</p>
<h3 id="e165">News from the Municipal Industrial Products Testing Laboratory <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Since Dr. Shen Xiongqing took over as director of the Municipal Industrial Products Testing Laboratory (No. 4, Hehefang, Xiahui Road), the internal operations have been greatly expanded. Furthermore, an additional building at No. 3 next door has been leased. Craftsmen were hired to renovate it last month, and the work has now been completed. The number of commissions from various sectors is increasing daily, with dozens of items tested each month. Research problems such as polishing copper, lubricating oil, mimeograph paper, wax cakes, dry batteries, and badge coloring have all been started and will be successful in order. As for the certification issue, certificates have been issued for five items, including Aidulis Foreign Company's fertilizer, Baoxing Mineral Powder Factory's pencil lead, Taihe Hefen Factory's Hefen powder, Qi Minghe's colored hollow bricks, and Sanyu Industrial Society's silk yarn. It is also reported that the laboratory is currently standardizing the foot size and length of famous yarn silk socks produced by various sock factories in the city. Currently, the same size socks from each factory differ by as much as one to one and a half inches, making it impossible for buyers to choose. This is very inappropriate. The laboratory's deputy technician, Mr. Sun Zongshu, has visited various factories to investigate the situation of measuring socks and has now drafted a unified plan, which will be distributed to various factories soon to solicit opinions.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Two Trade Unions Retain Zheng Baozhao <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Telegram Submitted to the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Industry Consolidation Conference and the Beijing-Shanghai Section Transportation Workers' Union are alarmed that Zheng Baozhao, the deputy director of transportation of the railway, suddenly wants to resign. Therefore, they telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday to retain him, stating that they were shocked to hear that Zheng Baozhao, the deputy director of transportation of the railway, had submitted his resignation to the ministry. Since Zheng assumed office a year ago, he has been supervising employees and focusing on railway affairs in order to develop state-owned production. The recent progress of the railway is a clear proof of this. All employees of the railway are now in the midst of supporting him, so the sudden news of his resignation is alarming. Therefore, we telegraphed the ministry to respectfully request that you do not approve his resignation in order to comfort the public.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Measures for Purchasing and Transporting Chilean Nitrate <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Reviewed and Licensed by the Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau</p>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs of Nanjing sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that in order to verify the use of Chilean nitrate in various provinces, all purchases and transportation by inland stores in the future will be reviewed locally by the provincial Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau for approval. The merchants and factories in your area that operate this business and prepare to use it themselves should report the annual import quantity and usage to the Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau for record. Within the approved limit, apply for transportation in accordance with the law. In addition to the statutory procedures for preparing documents and paying fees and stamp taxes, there are no other expenses. If there are difficulties or demands, merchants are allowed to report them to the ministry. The corresponding letter is hereby conveyed for your information and compliance.</p>
<p>Shanghai Anti-Opium Society Statement Regarding</p>
<h3 id="e169">Hunan Province's Seizure of the Anti-Opium Society <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The news that the Hunan Anti-Opium Society was seized by the Changsha headquarters has drawn great attention from all sectors. According to the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, the Hunan Anti-Opium Society was initiated by local people and has only been in the preparatory stage for a few months. The preparatory committee has inquired about the organization's methods and requested various assistance. The society has requested it to handle it in accordance with the organizational outline of local anti-opium groups, which stipulates that only those local groups that are directly organized by the society and have the participation of major local legal groups are recognized. The Hunan Anti-Opium Society is still in preparation, and the details have not been formally reported. As for the reasons for being seized and the background, they are not known. Since the society and the society have no systemic relationship, the society cannot be responsible for all actions. However, the news reports that the society was used by communists and falsely collected money are not true. The Local Merchants Association of Hunan, which is organized by local merchants, has always been deeply jealous of the anti-opium movement. The local authorities are also collecting special taxes. The matter is likely to be framed in order to eliminate the force against opium and achieve their goals of public cultivation, public transportation, and public sales. The society is waiting for detailed news and will take measures to respond. If the reports are true, the society will request the authorities to ban the society in order to maintain the anti-opium movement. If the reports are false, the society will provide assistance out of sympathy. The society is deeply concerned that the outside world is unclear about the fact that the society's anti-opium groups are only sympathetic organizations with no systemic relationship, so the Standing Committee has repeatedly resolved that local anti-opium groups should not use the name of anti-opium branch societies in order to avoid causing misunderstandings.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Transportation of Cocoons and Tea on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been transporting cocoons and tea to the market. In order to maintain convenient and rapid freight transportation, the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department has approved the addition of vehicles to each freight train to load as much as possible. When there is freight congestion, special freight trains will be temporarily added to avoid hoarding. Therefore, this year's cocoon and tea transportation will not be delayed at the station. However, due to the increase in freight rates, many cocoon merchants have switched to shipping.</p>

<p>Since the relocation of the Shanghai Branch Line station to the east side of Baoshan Road on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's Songhu Branch Line, transportation has become more convenient. However, the intermediate traffic seems to be uneven, so the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department is now working to improve it. It is estimated that the timetable will be changed on June 1st.</p>

<p>A Child Picked Up a Hat, Starting a Conflict</p>
<p>The peacemaker was stabbed instead.</p>
<p>Qu Shixiang, from Anhui, runs a clothing shop called Qu Shunji at No. 1229 Avenue Road, Gordon Road. At around 9:45 PM yesterday, the shop was already closed. Qu's son, Haigou, was playing on the steps in front of the shop when he saw three rickshaws coming from east to west. Two were carrying American soldiers in uniform, and the other was carrying a Westerner in civilian clothes. As the rickshaw passed the shop, the hat worn by one of the soldiers suddenly blew off and fell to the ground. Qu Haigou, being young and ignorant, bent down, picked up the hat, and threw it back to the owner. Unexpectedly, the soldier suddenly jumped out of the rickshaw and ran straight to Haigou. Without asking any questions, he began to beat him. A shop assistant named Ma, seeing this, became very angry and came forward to mediate. However, the American soldier not only refused to let go but also took out a small knife and began to wave it, stabbing Ma in the head, waist, and abdomen. The clothing shop owner, Qu Shixiang, was also caught in the crossfire while trying to resolve the situation, suffering head and left arm injuries and passing out on the spot. Many onlookers were angry but dared not speak out until the patrol officers arrived and reported to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The Avenu Road Fire Brigade used an ambulance to send the two injured people to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The two soldiers who committed the crime were taken to the police station for questioning. The injured Qu Shixiang is 41 years old. He was stabbed in the left ear, and his left arm also suffered severe injuries. His assistant is 40 years old and was injured in the left ear and neck. The weapon entered the left side of the ear and penetrated deep into the throat, with a wound about seven or eight inches long, which is very dangerous. The abdomen wound could also be fatal. Qu Haigou, who picked up the hat, is 16 years old, and his injuries are minor.</p>

<p>Resisting the Police Led to Arrest</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, five young Russians were passing by the Russian Consulate opposite the Licha Hotel on Huangpu Road. The building has been managed by the German Consul since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. After being handed over to Russian personnel last month, a portrait of Lenin was hung in the empty house. When the five Russians passed by, they hated Lenin because they had been stranded abroad. They broke in through the window and tore up Lenin's portrait. At that time, a Chinese police officer saw them and intervened. They refused to obey and resisted the Chinese police. Because they were outnumbered, they sounded the alarm. The five were arrested after police officers arrived. The names of the five Russians are Ai Wenximan, 20 years old, Xiyin, 16 years old, Pixiyin, 21 years old, Nuoweikefu, 17 years old, and Mai'erkefu, 18 years old.</p>

<p>Unknown if It Is Wang Weiyuan</p>
<p>A Letter of Affection Is Heartbreaking</p>
<p>At around 7:00 AM yesterday, a patrol boat from the Wusongkou Lifesaving Bureau recovered a male corpse in the Huangpu River opposite Yizhoutang. The man was about 20 years old, wearing a striped flannel jacket, white twill shirt and trousers, blue serge trousers, white socks, and a Zhigong ne shoes. He was immediately taken to the beach and reported to the Lifesaving Bureau. The local constable reported to the local court. At 4:00 PM, the Songjiang coroner arrived to examine the body. Since no relatives of the deceased could be found, the court took custody of the body for burial. When the corpse was recovered, a black leather folder was found beside him. Inside was a long-term pass for Shanghai Park with the name Wang Weiyuan on it. It is unknown whether this is the name of the deceased. There was also a receipt No. 10189 for a registered letter sent from Shanghai to Beiping on April 15, addressed to the Huabei Post Office in Beiping. There was also a suicide note, which stated that he committed suicide by jumping into the river due to a broken love. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Dear, I picked up the pen to talk to you, but tears flowed uncontrollably instead of writing words. I'm heartbroken. I don't know what we are now and what to call you. If I write to you, will you ignore me? Do I have the face to do so? I keep thinking about it in my heart, so I wrote many letters and finally burned them with fire because I didn't dare to give them to you. Now I think everything is predestined and cannot be predicted by human power. We got the status of a loving, engaged couple, but we broke up due to some misunderstandings. It's really unexpected. The first day I came back, holding your jade hand again felt like a dream. When you were leaving, you tidied up the messy hair on my forehead for me, which showed that your love was as heavy as a mountain and completely revealed your loving heart. I will never betray your love. Tomorrow, you were walking by my side, and I said "Hello, Bai Xiang." This was because I loved you so much that I blurted it out. Who knew you would ignore me from then on. This repeated misunderstanding is even more unexpected. Now I have made up my mind to wait for you to take someone else's surname, let someone else take my surname, or go to the empty gate to repent and end my life. In short, I will always love you and never betray you. I will protect you when you are alive and bless you when you are dead. I wish you a bright future and boundless happiness in spirit.</p>

<p>Ransom of 5,000 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Go to Da'an Port to Redeem the Ticket</p>
<p>At around 10:00 PM the night before, more than a dozen thugs speaking with a Northern accent and armed with handguns and Mauser pistols suddenly broke into the home of Wang Shiming, the head of Yawo Sha Township outside Wusongkou. They burst into the room and silenced everyone. They then split up to search the house. It was said that the bandits intended to kidnap a grain merchant named Gu. However, Gu's family happened to be celebrating a happy occasion that day, with many guests present, so it was inconvenient to take action. Since the township head, Wang, was not at home, they kidnapped the township head's wife, Zhou, and took her onto a bandit boat, sailing elsewhere. It is said that Township Head Wang runs a small shop in Beizhen, which is managed by Zhou. Zhou was planning to go to Shanghai the next day to purchase goods, so she had 600 silver dollars in cash, which were also taken away by the bandits. Yesterday, they received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 5,000 silver dollars to be paid at Da'an Port in Jiangbei. Otherwise, there would be unfavorable consequences.</p>

<p>Tan Genglin and his wife, local residents of Sanxin Garden, Yangjiata, about two li south of Wangjialou, Hongqiao, Shanghai West, were suddenly assassinated by enemies at around 2:00 AM on the morning before (25th). Villagers sent Mr. and Mrs. Tan to Shanghai Nursing Hospital on Robegen Road. Due to the severity of their injuries, they were transferred to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment. Unfortunately, due to excessive bleeding, Tan Genglin died in the hospital at 6:00 PM. His wife, Tan Ji, suffered minor injuries and is not life-threatening. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deceased Family: The deceased, Tan Genglin, was 39 years old, a local resident of No. 94 Kangjiaqiao, south of Jinshi Great Temple on Kangnao Road, Shanghai West. He was very honest and hardworking and never argued with anyone. His wife, Ji, was 38 years old and had two sons and one daughter. The eldest son, Yongming, is 16 years old, the second son, Youyou, is 6 years old, and the daughter, Jingu, is 10 years old. His father, Tan Shunxiu, works in a foreign company. Six or seven years ago, Genglin and his friends Zhang Chunxiu, Zhang Fu, and others jointly purchased 7 mu of land in Bailongtan, south of Wangjialou on Hongqiao Road, and founded Sanxin Garden. Last winter, Genglin also purchased 3 mu of land near Yangjiata (about half a li from Bailongtan) and founded a garden solely. He built a simple bamboo fence around it and built two bungalows. The house number has not yet been assigned. Mr. and Mrs. Tan and their children moved into the residence immediately. Ji also helped her husband work, in addition to doing housework. The couple lived in harmony.</p>
<p>Assassination Situation: For some unknown reason on the 19th of this month, Genglin dismissed a servant named Jia, from Chongming. At about 2:00 AM on the 25th, three people each with weapons and flashlights broke into the house. Mr. and Mrs. Tan were awakened from their dreams. The assailants, without asking any questions, first stabbed Tan in the head and waist, totaling 13 stabs. He fell to the floor in a pool of blood. Ji was shocked and shouted for help and was beaten with an iron bar, causing bruises all over her body. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a hurry. Afterwards, neighbors Yang Mengzhou, Yang Muquan, Yang Genrong, and others carried Mr. and Mrs. Tan to Shanghai Nursing Hospital on Robegen Road. Due to the severity of the injuries, they were refused and transferred to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment. Unfortunately, due to excessive bleeding, he died in the hospital at 6:00 PM on the afternoon before. Ji's injuries are relatively minor and are unlikely to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Detained Suspects: After the incident, Pan Xueceng, the chief of the Hongqiao Township Police Station of the Sixth District One Branch, investigated and found that the deceased's family had two ducks, which were killed by Yang Zhiying, Yang Yuting, and others from Yangjiata on the fourth day of the second month of the lunar calendar this spring under the pretext of banning ducks, which caused a slight argument with the deceased. Therefore, Yang and others are suspected of being involved in Tan's murder, and they were arrested and sent to the Sixth District One Branch for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Case of the Private Detective's Robbery of Morphine <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective of the Second Section of the Inspector General’s Office of the General Police Department, was suspected of involvement in the robbery of morphine worth 50,000 silver dollars at the home of Li Liansheng, No. 439 Maleli, Chongqing Road, on July 28. He was detained by Western Inspector-General Yao Ke and sent to the Special District Court for two trials. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. At around 1:00 PM yesterday, Judge Ge Zhitan took the seat in the Second Criminal Court for a continued trial. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that since the case occurred, the police department had begun to investigate the stolen morphine, but there was still no progress. Li Liansheng's representative lawyer, E Sen, and the defendant Liang Chengyu's lawyers, Ye Fukan, Yuan Yang'an, Peng Xie, and others, appeared in court to defend him. According to Liang Chengyu, Li Liansheng, also known as Fang Liansheng or Xiao Liansheng, was known to him. Last year, when he lived in Dafangli, South Chengdu Road, Fang Liansheng also lived in the second house in the alley behind Baoyufang on that road, facing each other. After Li Huiqing was kidnapped, the Old Gate Police Department arrested the kidnappers Lu A’gen, Zhou Linsheng, and Zhou's mistress, Xu Yuying. The three confessed that Fang Liansheng was an accomplice. He had repeatedly tried to arrest him but failed to do so. This time, he was falsely accused due to a grudge. (Note: Lu A’gen has been sentenced to death, Zhou has been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Xu has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.) Li Liansheng denied being Fang Liansheng and having anything to do with the kidnapping case. Judge Ge examined the confession and observed that the judgment of the Lu A’gen kidnapping case contained Xu Yuying’s confession that she knew Liansheng. He then ordered the bailiff to bring Xu Yuying from the women's detention center of the Special Court to prove whether the Liansheng in this case was the same Liansheng in the kidnapping case. Before long, the defendant Xu arrived at the trial. She confessed that her name was Xu Yuying and that she knew Zhou Linsheng. One day, Lu A’gen and Liansheng came to my house to visit Zhou Linsheng, so I knew Liansheng. Judge Ge then ordered Xu to identify who Liansheng was in court. After a brief look, Xu pointed out Li Liansheng, but stated that she only knew his name was Liansheng and did not know his surname. At this point, the witness testimony was completed. Judge Ge announced that the closing arguments would begin. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin and defendant lawyers Ye Fukan and Peng Xie then stood up and argued with each other. Judge Ge then announced that the closing arguments of the case were concluded and that the sentencing would be scheduled for the afternoon of June 2. The defendant Liang Chengyu was returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Resolution of the Case of Overseas Chinese Children Returning to the United States <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Daily Press Association received a letter dated April 29 from Lin Shiheng, Chairman of the American Overseas Chinese Exemption Association, and Deng Zuyin, Director of the Executive Department. The letter stated that China and the United States are countries that can trade with each other, and merchants from both countries should have the freedom to travel to each other. However, recently, the United States has often restricted this right for Chinese merchants, especially the inability of Chinese merchants who entered after 1924 and their wives to obtain return permits, which is the most harmful. Because 80 to 90 percent of Chinese people enter with this qualification, if they cannot return to the United States after returning to China, the number of overseas Chinese in the Americas will decrease day by day and may eventually disappear. The overseas Chinese were worried and organized this association in 1929 by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of the Americas, the Ningyang General Association, the Zhaoqing General Association, the Gangzhou General Association, the Yanghe General Association, the Sanyi General Association, the Hehe General Association, the Renhe General Association, the Tongyuan General Association, the General Branch of the Kuomintang, the General Branch of the Constitutional Party, the Zhigong General Hall, the Christian Federation, and the Youth Association, with a total of fifteen major groups each sending two representatives to deliberate and proceed. They then selected Zuyin and Shiheng to go to Washington, D.C., to negotiate with the Ministry of Labor. Fortunately, the Ministry of Labor did not abandon them and issued Decree No. 13, allowing Chinese merchants and their wives to obtain return permits, which can be said to be a successful negotiation. However, the ministry subsequently explained that children of Chinese merchants who are 21 years old have reached adulthood and lose the qualification to obtain return permits. This interpretation is very different from what Zuyin and Shiheng requested when negotiating in Washington, D.C., and is not enough to comfort the overseas Chinese. Therefore, last year, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce sent Zuyin and Liu Zhanbo to Beijing again to negotiate with the Ministry of Labor and request that it be revised. Zuyin returned to Shanghai and spent several months with Shiheng deliberating and seeking assistance from all parties so that the Ministry of Labor could make a satisfactory decision as soon as possible. It was finally approved on the 25th of this month and has been in effect ever since. Chinese merchants have benefited greatly from this, and the entire overseas Chinese community is extremely delighted. It is hoped that the comrades in your area also have the same feelings and should communicate with each other to investigate.</p>

<p>Dilapidated Houses at Sanpailou Wangyun Road Limited to Immediate Demolition and Construction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau found that the houses at Nos. 2 to 18 Sanpailou and Nos. 9 to 37 Wangyun Road have been in disrepair for many years and are leaning and tilting. Not only does this hinder road administration, but it is also dangerous. These two roads are important north-south thoroughfares in the city, and vehicles and pedestrians are crowded during morning and evening hours. Therefore, the bureau has already notified the owners of each property to immediately demolish and rebuild in accordance with the regulations to narrow the road surface to facilitate traffic.</p>

<p>There are a total of more than 50 households in Shunxingli, Gonghe New Road, Zhabei. The drinking water they need has always been taken from the north and south wells. Recently, many small worms were suddenly found in the north well, which is harmful to health. Although residents have requested improvements from the owner, they have been ignored. The Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau reported that the summer season is approaching in an instant, and the residents' need for water cannot be ignored. It is heard that the bureau has ordered the owner to make substantial improvements within two weeks and to clean the well pipes to prevent the breeding of bacteria. Otherwise, Zhabei tap water will be connected for drinking to emphasize public health.</p>

<p>The old goods stalls on both sides of the sidewalk at the corner of Pingjili Road and Bai'er Road in the French Concession were previously banned by the French authorities at the request of the stores on that road. Afterwards, the stallholders, concerned about their livelihoods, jointly organized the Old Goods Stall Industry Federation and appealed to all parties to restore the old status quo in order to maintain their livelihoods. The case has now been mediated by the Nanyang Bridge Chamber of Commerce, and the French authorities have agreed to allow each stall to be set up again, but stalls are not allowed to be set up at the corner of Bai'er Road.</p>

<p>Two American sailors, Brandel X. Secreper (transliteration), stationed on an American warship in the Huangpu River at the Xin Kai River wharf, hired a rickshaw at 3:00 PM on the 23rd to the Jinliyuan Wharf No. 8 warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau on the Bund of the French Concession. After getting off the rickshaw, they walked to the No. 11 embankment bridge, where they fought each other. Secreper accidentally fell into the water. At the critical moment, a bystander, Dai Tingzuo (23 years old) from Jiangbei, jumped off the bridge to rescue him. However, Brandel X, who was standing on the bridge, pushed Dai, causing him to fall into the river. Because it was high tide and the water was rapid, he drowned. The body floated to the surface at the original location where he fell into the river at 11:00 AM the next morning. After being salvaged, the case was reported to the French police, who sent detectives to carry the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan sub-station. The father of the deceased, Dai Yongxiang, identified the body. The circumstances of the report and examination have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Section of the French Police reported to the French Court, where Judge Zhu examined the body and confirmed that the deceased had drowned while alive.

<h3 id="e196">The Excellence of Huasheng Electric Fans <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Huasheng Electric Appliance Manufacturing Factory on Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou, Shanghai, is a pioneer in China's electric appliance manufacturing industry. Established for many years, with rich experience, its various electric appliance products have long been praised by people from all walks of life. At this time, during the summer season, the electric fans produced by the factory are especially welcomed by society because of their many advantages. Here are some of them for the enjoyment of the people: The motor housing and base of the electric fan are made of steel, which is extremely strong, and painted with the best black paint. The wings are gold, and the base is lined with green, making the colors bright and beautiful. The speed of rotation is equipped with a three-speed switch. The high speed is 1,280 revolutions per minute, which shows the sufficiency of the wind power. The economy of electricity consumption is unmatched by any electric fan. For example, a 56-inch ceiling fan costs only one cent and six li of electricity per hour, a 16-inch table fan costs eight li of electricity per hour, and a 12-inch table fan costs five li of electricity per hour. Moreover, it can be used for any length of time without overheating, and is guaranteed for ten years. If there is no accidental damage, repairs will be free of charge. In this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, it is a great opportunity to promote domestic products. It is also heard that the factory's pricing of electric fans this year is particularly low in order to repay the enthusiasm of compatriots who love domestic products. For the convenience of customers, the factory has authorized major electrical material stores in this city and other places to sell its products.</p>

<h3 id="e204">New Large Warehouse of Zhejiang Industrial Bank <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>On North Suzhou Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank has established three warehouses along the Suzhou River near the section to store collateral, stack goods, and handle passenger and freight matters properly. In recent years, the Shanghai market has been booming, and the need for cargo mortgages has been particularly high. The bank has noticed that the original warehouse buildings are old and has built seven five-story reinforced concrete warehouse buildings on North Suzhou Road along the Suzhou River to the east of the Old Garbage Bridge, which have been completed, covering an area of approximately seven acres. The front and back doors are both along the road, and the steel structure and ventilation ducts are all constructed using the latest methods. It is equipped with three of the latest elevators for loading and unloading goods. Insurance can be charged at the rate of first-class warehouses. The bank has also set up an insurance agency to provide insurance for goods stored in the warehouse. The warehouse rent is priced very reasonably. The warehouse has a branch so that goods stored in the warehouse can be borrowed from the branch if they need funds. All the equipment is designed to prioritize the interests of customers, making it the only warehouse of its kind in this city.</p>

<p>I have just read a report in your newspaper's "Local News" column on May 24th about a labor dispute at the Jinxin Cloth Factory. According to the investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was the factory that was at fault for dismissing six workers on the 5th of this month. In fact, the two parties could not reach an agreement, and it was difficult to resume work. However, there are less than 20 male workers in the wood factory. How could there be more than 50 workers who went on strike together because mediation was ineffective? The workers have always been peaceful, and the capitalists have never suffered. The workers have always been peaceful, and the capitalists have no grievance or bitterness and the relationship is very good. Now reading your newspaper that a strike has occurred has no basis in fact. For the sake of society and for our own sake, we ask that you issue a correction. Please be informed. Jinxin Factory Worker Representative Sanbao Huang Shengxiang.</p>

<h3 id="e208">A Record of the Amusing Farewell Party of Jiaotong University Teachers and Students <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The class committee of the 20th class of Jiaotong University in this city, considering that the classmates of this class will soon leave the university and scatter in all directions, in order to unite feelings and permanently commemorate the occasion, held an unprecedented farewell party for all teachers and students of the university last Saturday evening. The party was full of interesting moments. I will describe one or two of them as follows:</p>
<p>The Shot Put King Performs Sparrow and Child: Lu Mingjun, the nationally famous shot put king, is also a classmate of this class. That night, he performed a song and dance drama, "Sparrow and Child," in which he played a small sparrow, while Zheng Ruhua and Chen Zhenrui, two gentlemen with large physiques, played the large sparrows and the child. It can be said that they exhausted their comedic talents. When they came on stage, the large and small sparrows each wore colorful costumes, sang, and danced gracefully. It is said that they had been practicing for several days. However, Lu, after all, is an athletic champion. In his vigorous dance, one could see his shot put, running, and basketball shooting postures. The audience cheered after each of the two acts.</p>
<p>The Water Escape of the Fine Arts School: That night, students from the Fine Arts School were also invited to perform magic, with more than ten acts, all of which were fantastically unpredictable. The most valuable were the live swallowing of burning charcoal and the water escape. The live swallowing of burning charcoal was performed by placing charcoal in the fire, and within a moment, the charcoal was red. The performer then put it in his mouth. In order to allow the audience to observe clearly, the performer walked to the bottom of the stage and performed it several times in the crowd. Everyone exclaimed in amazement. The last was the water escape. This magic trick is not common in China. A large bucket was filled with warm water and a person was put in it, covered with a lid and locked. After four minutes, the person came out leisurely. The skill was truly divine.</p>
<p>Two New Plays: Spoken dramas have recently become quite popular in Shanghai because they are more moving than Peking opera. That night, two plays were staged one after the other. One was "Suzhou Night Talk," directed by Mr. Pan Tinggan. The plot briefly describes a painter who encountered war in his youth and his home was burned. His wife and daughter were separated and he came to Suzhou alone to teach painting for a living. His wife and daughter also came to Suzhou later. The wife remarried a wealthy merchant, but unfortunately the merchant took a concubine, and the mother and daughter were abused. The mother soon passed away, and the daughter became a flower seller. One day, she happened to sell flowers at the painter's house and the father and daughter were reunited. Its intention is very profound. Ms. Wang Tongying, who played the flower seller, described the tragic past, and her expression was truly moving. Many women in the audience wept. Mr. Yu Shihuang, who played the old painter, was quite suitable for the role. The audience unanimously praised it as a great ethical construct. The other was "Poor Fika," directed by Ying Yunwei. The plot briefly describes Fika's love of drinking, and he was always drunk when he returned home. His wife was worried about him, so she discussed it with a doctor. One day, Fika was drunk again. The doctor ordered his wife to wear plain clothes and pretend that Fika was dead. Soon, Fika woke up and saw that everything in the room was different. His wife shed tears and called out to him, but he did not respond. A friend of his, a doctor, came and told him about his death. Fika was shocked and thought that he was dead. The doctor then proposed to his wife. Fika was angry and regretted it. He fell down and groaned. The doctor added sleeping pills to his face to make him lose consciousness. On the one hand, he restored everything in the room to its original state. Soon, Fika woke up and saw his beloved wife and the doctor attending to him. Only then did he realize that what he had seen just now was a dream. However, because the stimulation was too deep, he finally knew to cut off his ties with alcohol. Mr. Qin Shaoji, who played Fika, and Ms. Gu Meijun, who played Fika's wife, acted wonderfully and the meaning was particularly high.</p>
<p>Two Little Babies: The two sons of Mr. Du Dingyou, the director of the school library, were only four or five years old. Because of their excellent family education, they were also quite familiar with singing and dancing. That night, they performed on stage, lively and lovely, shining alternately with the sparrows and children performed by the Three Great Vajras, presenting a wonderful scene.</p>

<p>— Recent work by Ms. Yang Lingfu</p>
<p>The Forbidden City wall road awaits revisiting, the cloud steps and moon land are desolate. The remaining silk is plain. A path of fallen flowers. The red brush of the imperial carriage leads to the leisurely fun of tea cups. It is the old fishing and swimming spot. Lonely spring, imprisoned in the frontier, full of yellow sand, felt tent, eating frost and dew. Yao Island dreams are negative year after year, and the double wheels grind the West City rain at night. Looking at the ferry, leaving and staying are helpless, lingering and waiting. The fragrant trees are in the sunset for thousands of miles. Who will protect the falling flowers? It is hard to describe the sorrow of parting. The tears on the painting are marked with tears. Tracing back to the Yonghe people, it has become the past. Spring is gone and it is hard to stay.</p>

<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>The twenty-second day of the month was the birthday of the mother of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, the assistant manager of the Mingxing Film Company. The celebration was held at the Taiheyuan Restaurant on Er Ma Road. The weather was clear that day, and five or six hundred relatives and friends came to congratulate him. The colleagues of Mingxing also publicly presented a theatrical performance to celebrate. I was fortunate enough to attend the grand banquet and will record what I saw and heard to leave a mark.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Congratulatory Remarks: The birthday hall was resplendent with gold and splendor, and good words were like pearls. A silk-embroidered queen mother was suspended in the middle, and a couplet by Mr. Chen Qicai was suspended on the side. The wording was grand and the writing was excellent. The two walls were birthday screens. On the right side were those presented by Yan Shenyu, Fan Shuhan, Gu Kenfu, and other gentlemen. Both the sentiment and writing were excellent. On the left side were those jointly presented by the Mingxing and Huawei companies, written by Mr. Zhu Dake and brushed by those who mastered the law. The elegance of the four parallel sentences was extreme, and Xiao Xu's calligraphy was especially skillful and stable. There were screens by Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiao Bo, Sun Yusheng, Feng Shuluan, Zhu Ying, and other gentlemen on the four walls, especially the Qianqiusui inscription by Hu Hanzhu and the poem by Chen Qingfeng, which were the most relevant and elegant. The three-dimensional congratulatory paintings by Huahuo, Zeng Buddha, and Hu Hensheng were all powerful works.</p>
<p>A Few Words about Watching the Opera: The theatrical performance began at 2:00 PM. After the troupe performed "Cifu," Zheng Xiaoqiu and Gu Meijun's "Little Cowherd" was performed, which was lively and delightful. The birthday mother was sitting high in front of the stage, smiling, and her heart was happy. Ren Chaojun's "Three Iron Roosters" was well-done, although Chaojun's stature was a little small, his skill was very good. Xu Zhiren's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" and Wang Xianzai and Xie Yunqing's "Hongluanxi" were both very experienced. Zhou Jianyun, Su Wanjun, Huang Lingxuan, and Dong Tianya's "Huilongge" was performed outstandingly. Jianyun, who played Pinggui, had a clear voice and extraordinary demeanor. Tianya's old lady spoke in pure language, and the two ladies, Wanjun and Lingxuan, played the princesses of Baochuan in a fitting manner, and their songs were also graceful. The bells had rung seven times, and the guests gathered, and the gongs and drums were temporarily stopped. The banquet was opened to entertain the guests. He Kuaihuo's He and Ziyou's Juan came late, and they sat with the retired Mingxing Ms. Zhang Zhiyun and others. It was said that there were fifty tables that night. The host Zhengqiu earnestly persuaded people to drink. Zhang Juchuan, the manager of the Central Company, took out a horse racing game from his basket, and there was a scramble for champagne for a while. The guests gathered and could be used as a decoration for the birthday hall. After the banquet, Zhengqiu personally took the stage and joined Liang Saizhen and Tang Jie in singing "Qingdingzhu". The applause was incessant. Wang Jiting and Ma Yinzi's "Zhulianzhai" was quite skilled. Zhou Jianyun and Ying Yunwen's "Youlongxifeng" was fragrant and touching. Wang Yushu and Xuan Jinglin's "Baoliandeng" was a perfect match and worthy of being called unique. The finale was Hu Die, Zhou Jianyun, Zhang Shichuan, Wang Xianzai, Tang Jie, and other gentlemen's "Longfeng Chengxiang". Because it was close to midnight, I did not finish the show and left, and it was a pity that I did not see the whole picture.</p>

<p>The Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai is one of the famous ancient temples in Shanghai. Every year on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, the birthday of the Buddha, worshippers are like clouds. This year, this day happened to fall on a Sunday, and the general good men and women all came to offer incense. The incense fire was prosperous, and the number of visitors reached more than 20,000. There were more than 1,000 stalls selling domestic products along the area from Carter Road to Jing'an Temple. This year, the Ministry of Industry suddenly issued a notice restricting the establishment of stalls, so the stallholders were panicked and sought assistance from all parties. Zhifa, the abbot of the temple, also repeatedly argued and negotiated, and finally received a reply from the Ministry of Industry approving the establishment of stalls according to the old practice of previous years, so life was even more lively than in previous years. The crowd on Jing'an Temple Road was so large that it was like the "I can't walk, brother" in Hangzhou's incense boats. Tram passengers were crowded, and rickshaw drivers were gouging, charging four small oceans for what normally cost twenty copper coins from Carter Road to Jing'an Temple, no different from the gherkin sellers in Hangzhou's incense boats. Inside the temple, the former Guangdong Governor Li Guojun had a couplet that read: "Tin flies often close to the crane, the cup is passed without alarming the stork." On this day, the monks of the temple provided vegetarian meals for the followers. This flourishing bathing Buddha festival ended at sunset.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>I often say that Japan is able to continue the ancient Eastern civilization with the new Western civilization. Let me talk about the elegance of their customs. One day, I went to a bank to withdraw a remittance. Unexpectedly, it was a branch, and I had to go to the main branch to withdraw it. When I went out, I asked the doorman, "Where is the main branch?" I just asked casually, and the old gentleman became very happy, gesticulating for a long time, and I still stumbled. I took the wrong turn, and he finally led me for a long way until I saw the spire of the main branch in the distance before he stopped. Such enthusiasm is admirable. One day, I went with Mr. Zeng to visit a friend. After getting into the car, it had already moved several feet when someone ran up from behind and asked, "Did you lose a pen?" Mr. Zeng checked and knew that the pen was lost, so he replied, and the man asked, "What color is it?" He replied, "It's red." The man then led Mr. Zeng to the front of the police station and saw someone else holding a red pen high in his hand, walking towards the police station. A and B made contact and returned the item to its owner. It turned out that B saw the lost pen on the ground and, not knowing who it belonged to, picked it up and sent it to the police station. A, knowing who lost the pen, specially led him to retrieve it. Neither of these Japanese people hesitated to sacrifice their spirit and time to perform such duties for strangers. How could the cultivation of this kind of service spirit be achieved in a day or two? Another time, I was in Shenyang, looking for a suitable dry plate for the camera I brought. I asked several stores, and they all said they didn't have it. I entered a photo studio, and a Japanese man came out, inspected it, and said, "We don't have it, but I can look for it for you at other stores." Then he led me to many stores, and finally I managed to buy it before he said goodbye and left. He didn't make a penny of business, but he was willing to help people like this. I was so grateful to him that I was afraid of him. He was none other than a brave general who had won a hundred battles in the commercial battlefield!</p>
<p>All of the above can be said to be the good customs passed down from ancient times in the East, perhaps half of which are ideal. They are actually able to preserve and realize them. On the one hand, they have greatly absorbed Western material civilization in science.</p>
<p>I need to think deeply about this. It is a pity that this kind of virtue of people getting along with each other is extended to the international arena so that countries can also uphold justice, serve others, and help the weak and eliminate the strong. If all the commonly used methods of mutual suspicion, mutual jealousy, provocation, manipulation, deception, intimidation, fraud, and aggression are swept away, then it will be worthy of praise from all mankind.</p>
<p>A Farewell to Spring Tune</p>
<p>A strip of water, a thousand sails weave, a short stay in Penglai, spring has no trace. Tokyo and Xijing connect travel skirts, a thousand branches and ten thousand branches mark the national color. I come to the Eastern country when the flowers are just blooming, and by the time I return, the flowers have already withered. A lifetime of short dreams, spring comes and goes, in an instant, the bright mirror fades with red cheeks. There is no way to cherish the flowers and keep spring, craning my neck to look at the Eastern Emperor, silent and speechless. The guest's heart is busy straight for Qian Chun, the flower season is even more hurried than the tour schedule. I want to ascend the spring terrace, a crowd of beings, hand in hand, temporarily welcome each other. All who have blood and breath are like brothers, do not let them cook each other like beans. Once gone, the noble and the lowly are all equal, then people and things do not contend. When all beings are happy, the four seas are in spring, the flower world is long and affectionate. The lonely guest at the end of the world indulges in reverie, the trees are still like this, what about people? The Imperial Canal, a song, a double bridge, fallen flowers like snow, the sky vast and boundless.</p>

<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>He casually took out a pencil and wrote the number L. 72 in his diary. He continued, "I think that the white towel is not only very new, but also starched very stiffly, which shows that it was washed and ironed in a laundry shop. This number is probably written in the laundry shop for identification." I couldn't help but nod in agreement and said, "You are so careful! But I don't know how many laundry shops there are in Shanghai, which is several times more than the shops that sell Pearl Buck. What method did you use to investigate?" Hawthorne said, "This line is indeed more difficult. Fortunately, I have another auxiliary line." I asked in surprise, "Is there another line?" Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, don't you remember that when he used the trick of diverting the tiger away from the mountain, he called me to Zhe Shao Villa at No. 707 Datong Road? The location of Datong Road is very remote. If he didn't see the house number of Zhe Shao Villa often, how could he remember it so clearly? Therefore, I guessed that he must live on Datong Road, or at least pass by there often, so he remembered the house number of the villa very well. In a hurry, he couldn't think of another place, so he deliberately teased me with this villa where the coffin was sent. Because of this, I went to several laundry shops near Datong Road to investigate carefully. I inquired at nine shops and succeeded. The laundry shop is called Luhongji. The L is the abbreviation of the Pinyin of the word Lu. The number seventy-two is the number of their customers. So I knew that this person is called Che Shijie and lives at No. 11 Minquan Road, a horizontal road on the west side of Datong Road. Then I spent some effort to find out the history and current situation of this person. I also saw him once in person at the door of his house before I was sure that there was no mistake in this person. Later, I specially sent two people, one is Jin Sheng, who is guarding outside the Wen Lawyer's Office on Qingyun Road, and the other is Xu Hu, whom I borrowed from Zhang Baoquan, who is guarding outside Che Shijie's residence, and told them to report Shijie's whereabouts to me at any time. Until tonight, Jin Sheng called to inform me that Shijie had gone to the Carlton with a woman. I thought the time had come, so I implemented the plan I had prepared earlier. Are you satisfied with the way our encounter ended this time?" I couldn't help but pat Hawthorne on the shoulder and said, "Old friend, I really admire you twelve points! But this time, Che Shijie will definitely know that it was our revenge because of the return of the necklace. Then if he comes to look for us..." Hawthorne suddenly stopped me and said, "Don't worry, I originally wanted him to know before doing this. We are equally not liable under the law, so you don't have to worry. Isn't this your residence? Get out of the car quickly. Please say hello to your wife for me. If you are afraid that Che Shijie will come to take revenge again, if you have any preparation methods, that is another matter. Come to my residence tomorrow, and I will let you give full play to your abilities." (End)</p>

<p>Eight Hundred and Seven Taels</p>
<p>A Flying Leap of Twelve and a Half Taels. Yesterday, on the 26th, the gold price reached an unprecedented new peak of eight hundred and five taels or more. The silver market reported a decline, and there was a tendency to rise in the industry. However, the fluctuations were frequent, and the foreign exchange market was tight, with the exchange rate shrinking by one level. From the peak of the previous market to the subsequent decline, there was a difference of more than seven taels. The market later showed a soft but strong trend, with a difference of ten taels. It is now reported that the United States is selling silver, and the market has received this news, so the price has soared into the clouds. Because the exchange rate is increasingly tight, large investors on the trading floor have been actively buying, which ultimately led to a sharp increase of twelve or thirteen taels, which is irresistible. It is said that there is still the potential for a decline in the main bars this morning.</p>
<p>Opening Jumps Eight Taels From the early morning opening in July, the price rose eight taels to eight hundred and two and a half taels. Silver bars fell by sixteen and five cents, the overall silver price fell by half a cent, and private telegraphs shrank by two and five cents. Yuan Cheng, Yong Tianfeng, and Yong Deng all continued to buy at .05 taels. Subsequently, Shunli, Wanxing, Daxing, Yong Deng, etc. sold, and the price fell sharply by seven taels. Only one or two taels moved back and forth. As for the exchange rate, Sanlin, Mitsui, Wahbi, etc. first offered 1.875, then 2.5, and then dropped to about seven hundred and ninety-eight taels. When the first order was announced, 97 taels and 8 cents had already shrunk by 2.5. The US dollar was 5 jiao, and the Japanese yen was plus 2.75 cents. Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, etc. immediately bought, and the price immediately rose to 801 taels and 8 cents. Furthermore, HSBC bought near-term British gold at 2.5, and soon the price fell back to 800 taels and .005 cents. Zhifeng, Yongyuanheng, Daxing Yong, and speculators then bought, and the price rose steadily until 10:30, reaching .05 taels and 1 cent. Soon after, Hengxing, Yu Da, and the Dalian gang rushed to sell, and the price fell again by more than six taels, with a difference of two taels and zero. At 10:50, the price was 798 and a half taels. At 11:00, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Yuancheng, etc. all bought, and the price soared by more than four taels. At 11:25, the price was 803 taels. Afterwards, the situation was potentially low, but the sellers occupied more people's minds, and the strength turned into weakness. At noon, the price was 798 taels and 6 cents, which was almost one tael plus. The noon close was 99 taels and then fell back to 97 taels and 45 cents. The reason was that Tong Taichang, etc. sold out, and the announced price was changed to 839 taels and 4 cents, a decrease of more than 41 taels, to 34 kings and two taels. The noon close was more than 40 taels.</p>
<p>Rising High After the Close After the market, the opening price was 96 taels and 8 cents, followed by 6 taels and 3 cents, and then there was more than one tael up and down. The buying and selling on the trading floor were different, and the amount was not smooth. After 2:30, the sharpness had been revealed, and the buyers were also active. The Cantonese gang, etc. bought US dollars at 28 yuan and 9375 cents, and British gold was sold by banks such as Zhongri from August 25th. At 3 o'clock, the price was 99 taels and 8 cents. Shengda, etc. took the stage to sell, and the price fell again by two taels. At 3:20, the price was 97 taels and 8 cents. Afterwards, the price rose sharply again and had already exceeded the 800 taels mark. Wanxing, Yuancheng Yong, Shunli, Yu Da, Zhifeng Yong, Yuankang Xiang, Daxing Yong, etc. all competed to buy enthusiastically. It was also rumored that the United States was selling silver, and people's minds were immediately high. The market was full of flying and soaring, jumping more than ten taels.

<p>Chinese Merchants Actively Buy British Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver market was closed, and the US silver market was slightly longer. The market was flat, and HSBC's pegged rates had shrunk by one level.

Therefore, the closing price was lower than last Saturday. British gold shrank by 1.875 cents, the US dollar shrank by 3.125 cents, and the Japanese yen rose by 2 cents. Chinese merchants such as Yufeng, Yongfu, Changtai, Kangrun, and Shengda actively bought British gold to hedge against gold. The transaction was about 300,000 pounds, but the banks were not willing to sell. Mumbai also sold, and American silver banks also made transactions of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan with each other. The Cantonese gang bought slightly, while the Dalian gang made slight transactions in Japanese gold, but only tens of millions of yuan. The exchange market is unusually sharp and still low.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the opening day after the banks were closed for several days.

<p>More Continuing Declines Than Before, Market Conditions Remain Smooth</p>
<p>May Term Stops Bidding Today, Preparing for Delivery</p>
<p>Although there were many spot transactions of public bonds yesterday, the turnover was still small. The May term futures expired yesterday and will stop bidding today to prepare for delivery. However, the bond prices fluctuated greatly, and the market was extremely lively. Due to time constraints, there was only one transaction in the early market, but the turnover was also more than 1.1 million yuan. There were two transactions in the later market, totaling more than 1.6 million yuan. The fluctuations were still very sharp. The opening in the morning was enthusiastic for selling, and the price was still weak. The buyers seemed to be slightly stronger. The later market was still firm, but at the close, a certain party suddenly sold a large amount, and the price fell rapidly. As a result, it generally continued to fall. The total turnover of futures reached more than 27.5 million, and the spot transactions were only 7,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Markets Suddenly Turn Low <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market suddenly fell, and the situation was slightly weak. The reason was that the overseas flower and yarn conditions were unilaterally discussing the downward trend, and the falling trend was still strong. However, the exchange rate was still tight and could still support it. However, most sellers' attitudes were very strong. Because the number of coarse yarn deliveries this month was huge, although a certain giant merchant had a large number of receipts, some retail investors sold out, and the market atmosphere suddenly loosened. The distant months were affected, and the market suddenly turned sharply downward. Rumors about the current situation in the commercial market were also rampant. Therefore, the pressure on the sellers became heavier. However, the sales of current yarn were still developed, and the purchase from the north was very strong. The actions of the Cantonese gang were becoming increasingly noticeable. Judging from the general trend of the yarn market, it is currently in a hovering situation.</p>
<p>The Reduction in the Bid This Month Reached Two Taels. In the Early Market, the opening price for the Bid This Month was Based on the Flat Gold Price and the Continuing Decline in American Cotton. There Were Many Sellers and Few Buyers. Each Fell by Eight or Nine Cents to One Tael and One Cent. In the Afternoon, There Were Many Longs Selling out this month, near dips of one or two taels, distant dips of six or seven cents, and the turnover was 31,050 bales. It was found that Taixing sold 1,050 bales, Yichang sold 1,400 bales, Rongxing sold 1,050 bales, and Xincheng sold 1,050 bales. Shenxin bought 1,150 bales, Yiyu bought 2,050 bales, and Xiesheng bought 950 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market turned down because the American and Indian cotton continued to fall. The 9-point customs line for each month was difficult to maintain, and the gold price hovered around 800 taels. Therefore, people's minds were calm, and some retail longs closed out. However, Japanese merchants and large households still had no intention of selling. This month was the last day, and a certain factory and Dongmian had a large number of receipts, so the market was still flat.</p>
<p>Han Standard Fell by Four, Five, and Six Cents The Early Market Opening for Han Standard Was Very Weak Due to the Sharp Drop in American and Indian Cotton and the Flat Gold Price.

<h3 id="e223">Grain: Rice Sales Become Sluggish <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for guest rice turned to a steady state. Transactions were quiet, and prices remained unchanged. It seems it will again enter a state of stagnation. This is mainly because the stock of rice in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces is already low, and new supplies must await the autumn harvest. Demand for guest rice is inherently weak, and local merchants are shifting their attention to shipments arriving by river and train from Hebei. Consequently, the market for guest rice is being sidelined. Yesterday, the entire city only handled 100 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice at a price of ten yuan and five jiao, and 100 bags of Mingguang indica rice at a price of ten yuan and one jiao, all transacted by local merchants. Since the price of foreign rice rose, orders are unprofitable. There were also no disposals. Sales of guest rice were very good, but inventories are low and there is no high-quality rice. Yesterday, merchants from Guangdong province handled over 100 bags of Jiangxi Zhongguan machine-milled rice at a price of thirteen yuan and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Flour Prices Fall One After Another <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for various months fell because the price of foreign wheat continued to decline slightly by about three jiao. The weather was clear, and most bulls sold off their positions. The mentality of domestic merchants is entirely influenced by the weather. Now that the weather is good, many who previously bought are selling back. However, manufacturers are still taking a wait-and-see approach, paying little attention to either side, as they are unwilling to commit heavily at this time when new wheat is about to be harvested. As a result, this month's price fell by one fen and seven li and a half compared to the previous day, June fell by two fen, July fell by two fen and a half, August fell by two fen and seven li and a half, September fell by three fen, and October fell by three fen and two li and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Wheat Market Collapses Across the Board <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market, prices for various months saw a uniform collapse. With the weather clear and the wind favorable during the new wheat harvest, conditions seemed very good. Furthermore, the gradual price increases seemed to have little value in reality. Therefore, as soon as the weather cleared, confidence waned, and people became dispirited. The initial rumors of a short squeeze this month were met with willingness to deliver by those with spot goods after repeated price increases. Therefore, the panicked atmosphere of a few days ago softened yesterday. As a result, this month's price collapsed by seven fen and six li compared to the previous day, July fell by eight fen, August and September fell by nine fen, and October fell by seven fen.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rebound <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>

Due to the holiday, there were no telegrams from Java. The market was more buoyant due to the higher exchange rate, but there were few buyers. Due to tight controls, transactions were quiet.荷糖 No. 24 raw and white sugar was priced at eleven taels and two qian, No. 20 medium raw and white sugar at ten taels and seven qian, and No. 18 at ten taels and six qian.

However, DY opened with a five-fen increase, and subsequent offers were all higher, but most spot goods have been sold. The company only has several hundred bags of HM and ○ left. 禎祥號 sold over ten bags of No. 10 荷赤 at a price of nine taels and seven qian. 華新號 offered 1,000 bags of raw and white sugar at a price of eleven taels and two qian.

<h3 id="e228">The Principle, Structure, and Function of the Free Wheeling System <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Guoxiang</p>
<p>The principle of free wheeling is not new. England and France once experimented with it several years ago, but it failed to become popular on automobiles. Now, the American automotive industry has adopted this principle to improve the completeness of components and the economy of consumption. I briefly mentioned it in the first draft, and now I want to discuss this topic in three parts.</p>
<p>(1) Principle: The entire principle is the propulsive force generated by momentum. Observe a child riding a bicycle. When the speed reaches its fastest, the child suddenly stops pedaling. Logically, the speed of the bicycle should decrease greatly, but the bicycle still rushes forward extremely fast. Why is this? This is because of the propulsive force generated by momentum (see diagram CDE below, which indicates the thrust). On a bicycle, this component is called the flywheel. This principle has now been applied to automobiles.</p>
<p>(2) Structure: The free wheeling system is installed inside the gearbox. Its structure can be divided into two major parts (see arrow A in the diagram below, which indicates the installation of the free wheeling system): one is the outer casing, and the other is the inner core. When the free wheeling system is not working, these two parts are completely unrelated. Between the two, there are three conical raceways. Each raceway has a row of four steel balls that gradually increase in size. These four balls can run back and forth in the raceway (see diagram B below). The outer casing rotates with the force of the engine, and the inner core rotates the driveshaft, thereby transmitting power to the rear wheels. When the engine is driving the car forward, the three rows of steel balls (twelve in total) are forced to the narrow end of each raceway, connecting the engine and the rear wheels. When the carburetor throttle is closed, the engine immediately decelerates, and the outer casing also decelerates accordingly. At this time, the car's momentum drives the inner core to rotate, causing the steel balls to roll into the wide end of the raceway. Thus, the engine and the rear wheels are disengaged, but the car continues to move forward extremely fast. This entire process is natural and requires no clutch pedal, gear shifting, or other management.</p>
<p>(3) Function: The free wheeling system has many functions, which can be summarized into three: 1. Smooth vehicle operation; 2. Fuel economy; 3. Driving comfort.</p>
<p>1. Smooth Vehicle Operation: Ordinary three-speed and four-speed cars do not easily obtain engine braking force from second gear when descending hills. Installing a free wheeling system can provide this benefit, making downhill driving very smooth. Furthermore, shifting from second gear to third gear or from third gear to second gear does not require depressing the clutch pedal (although it is still permissible to do so), but the engine speed must be equal to or higher than the vehicle speed. The vehicle operates smoothly without any jolting. When the car approaches railway and highway intersections, simply move the free wheeling system to second gear to reduce speed and safely pass through. At the same time, it does not hinder acceleration and avoids any sluggishness. Regardless of the vehicle speed, gears can be changed at will. The car's four wheels are disengaged from the thrust, reducing slippage, which is especially beneficial on icy roads.</p>
<p>2. Fuel Economy: The most important saving is in the number of engine revolutions. Each time the free wheeling system engages, the engine stops working. On average, the engine only works for eight miles out of every ten miles driven. Driving 10,000 miles saves the engine 2,000 miles of work. According to tests by various companies, savings of 20% to 40% can be achieved. From this, it can be inferred that the engine's lifespan can be extended. Secondly, gasoline and lubricant are saved. When the free wheeling system is working, the throttle is closed, so gasoline can be saved by 12% to 20%. When the engine stops, lubricant can be saved by 20%. There are also considerable savings in regular vehicle maintenance, repairs, and engine decarbonization costs. Furthermore, using the free wheeling system extends the lifespan of various components in the car, such as the clutch, transmission, driving gear, rear axle, universal joint, and rubber tires.</p>
<p>3. Driving Comfort: After installing a free wheeling system, driving becomes easier, noise is eliminated, and the vehicle runs quietly, increasing driving comfort. Moreover, drivers are often overwhelmed and confused by the difficulty and complexity of managing automobiles, especially in heavy traffic, leading to anxiety, mental fatigue, and accidents. Those with free wheeling systems do not have these problems. With no complicated procedures to manage and no fatigue or mental confusion, they can move forward and backward freely and as desired. The benefits of the free wheeling system are significant.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Horrific Automobile Accidents in the United States <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>The United States is the most developed country in the automobile industry. Whether directly or indirectly, one in ten people relies on automobiles for their livelihood. However, the number of people who lose their lives in automobile accidents each year is also in the tens of thousands, which is truly shocking. According to a recent survey by the Travelers Insurance Company in Hartford, Connecticut, a total of 50,900 Americans died in automobile accidents in 1930. The shocking nature of this number is undeniable. According to the analysis, the day of the week with the most automobile accidents is Sunday, the time with the most accidents is between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, the weather is usually clear, and the location of the accidents is usually on flat, dry highways. Most of the cars involved in the accidents are privately owned, and most of the drivers are men with an average age of 39 and about one year of driving experience.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned survey report, the harm caused by automobile accidents is more severe than that caused by war. As for the cause of the accidents, driver negligence accounts for 68% of the total. Therefore, drivers are responsible for 84% of the deaths and 70% of the injuries and disabilities caused by automobile accidents. The report also clearly states that the harm caused by automobile accidents is more severe than that caused by war. Specifically, 50,510 American soldiers died in 18 months during World War I, while the number of deaths caused by automobile accidents in 1930 and the second half of 1929 reached 50,900. Is this not more severe than the harm caused by war? According to the analysis of the report, there were a total of 835,250 automobile accidents in 1930, resulting in 32,500 deaths and 962,325 injuries. Excessive speeding is a major cause of automobile accidents. Therefore, analyzing the deaths further, 8,146 people died from exceeding the speed limit, 3,241 people died from driving on the wrong side of the road, and 4,085 people died from disregarding traffic rules. Thus, driver negligence accounted for 85% of the 27,235 deaths.</p>
<p>Public buses accounted for a small percentage of automobile accidents in 1930. Among the 835,250 automobile accidents in that year, a total of 1,227,817 vehicles were involved. Of these vehicles, public buses were involved in only 331 fatal accidents and 8,337 non-fatal accidents. There are currently 95,400 public buses in the United States. Therefore, statistics show that only 9% of them are related to automobile accidents. Approximately 77% of the vehicles involved in accidents were privately owned cars, and this number accounts for 87% of the registered cars. Privately owned cars accounted for 78% of the deaths caused by automobile accidents. Commercial vehicles other than public buses accounted for only 15%. 45% of the accidents involved two cars colliding, and 46% involved cars colliding with pedestrians. 42% of the fatal automobile accidents occurred at intersections. However, the number of deaths was higher in accidents that occurred on roads. All the cars involved in the accidents that resulted in 32,500 deaths were in perfect mechanical condition.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Guizhou Province Transportation Company Expands Routes <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou in our country have mild climates and abundant products, making them prosperous regions. However, due to the obstruction of mountains and the inconvenience of transportation, everything is still in its infancy. During the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xiong and other gentlemen from Guizhou Province gathered large amounts of capital to establish a large-scale pioneer transportation company and set up branch stations in Tongzi, Zunyi, and other places. They specially sent people to Shanghai to purchase vehicles. After careful consideration, they decided to purchase ten Dodge special trucks managed by the American China Motor Company in Shanghai. It was originally planned to ship them immediately, but due to the impact of the political situation at the time, it was not until the 19th year of the Republic of China that people were sent to Shanghai to load and transport them. There were ships that could travel from Shanghai to Chongqing, but the route from Chongqing to Guizhou was mountainous and rugged. Even walking on foot was difficult, let alone these heavy cars. Therefore, during transportation, the managing company devised a way to dismantle each vehicle and pack it into more than a hundred boxes. The company also sent many mechanics and technicians to Guizhou to reassemble them after arriving in Guizhou. They departed from Shanghai in the middle of last summer and arrived in Guizhou after more than sixty days. Although it has only been in operation for half a year, the results have been remarkable. A shareholder meeting was held last month, and it was decided to extend the routes and add vehicles. They ordered twelve more Dodge cars from the China Motor Company. At the end of last year, due to the large number of passengers, there were not enough vehicles. They had added several other types of trucks in Guangzhou, but the results of their use were not as durable as Dodge. Therefore, this time, they unanimously advocated adding more Dodge cars.</p>

<p>The World's Most Precious Gemstone Automobile: The Kansas City Automobile Dealers Association in the United States recently commemorated its 25th anniversary by decorating a Pierce-Arrow sports car with precious gems, totaling a value of $125,000. This is unprecedented in automobile decoration. To commemorate the 25th anniversary, the entire car is silver in color. The curtains, cushions, and other accessories are made of specially crafted green leather. The car hood, chassis, and rods are all decorated with precious stones, which are extremely valuable, exceeding $100,000. The diamond decorations are particularly dazzling. In terms of value, this car is more luxurious than the Pierce-Arrow car commissioned by the King of Persia, which was entirely carved from gold and platinum and was of inestimable value. Therefore, when it was displayed, sentries and detectives were specially deployed to protect it and prevent accidents. However, enthusiasts still regretted not being able to touch it. This gemstone masterpiece was recently shipped to India, where it was one of the prized decorations at the royal automobile exhibition. The attending kings of India all praised this car as a rare treasure that they had never seen before. The entire body of the car is a dazzling red, using lead sheets.</p>
<p>European Actress Travels Alone by Car: The famous European actress Tessa Ailing recently traveled 1,800 miles in Europe alone in a Morris automobile. Her experience is quite interesting because she did not encounter any difficulties along the adventurous journey. Ailing drove herself from Gouck to Alaxuehua and then returned to the starting point, completing the entire journey. The most difficult part of the journey was driving 833.5 miles in 27 hours, resulting in an average speed of 30 miles per hour. On the return trip, Ailing did not take the old road but chose a difficult mountain road around the Alps before reaching the starting point. From Grass to Glaneau, there were six rugged mountain roads, the lowest being 1,774 feet and the highest reaching 3,858 feet. In addition, the journey was fraught with wind and snow, and the cold was unbearable. The windshield was covered with ice and snow for fifty miles, forcing Ailing to lean out of the car to drive, exposing half of her body to the cold. The road up the mountain was extremely steep and covered with snow, making driving very difficult. Fortunately, the Morris car was built solidly and did not malfunction. Its automatic ignition system was also very satisfactory. Therefore, although the 1,800-mile journey was under extremely harsh weather conditions, Ailing was able to overcome the difficulties because of her courage and superior driving skills, as well as the excellent quality and durability of the Morris car.</p>

<p>— Wu Can</p>
<p>The Beauty of French Highways: Within dozens of miles around Paris, France, there are national highways connected. These national highways are nearly a hundred feet wide and paved with asphalt. Large trees are planted in two rows on each side of the road. In the spring and summer, the green leaves provide shade, making driving very elegant. The scenery on both sides is even more beautiful. Because the streets in Paris are orderly, the intersections are particularly lovely. The square of the Arc de Triomphe has twelve roads intersecting to form a circular shape. The majestic Arc de Triomphe can be seen from any angle. The surrounding streets intersect to form a rectangular square. The layout is exquisite, and there are gardens. Each route is designated to avoid confusion. The buildings on the other streets of Paris are also uniform and orderly, which is also very beautiful.</p>
<p>The Improvement of Dutch Highways: Although the Netherlands is a small country with an area of 34,190 square kilometers, its population density is very high, with a total population of over 7,737,000, or 226 people per square kilometer. A recent examination of the country's transportation situation reveals that the lack of good roads is still in its infancy. Although automobile transportation has become widespread, the poor condition of the roads makes improvement necessary. The total length of its roads is 25,000 kilometers, of which 2,000 kilometers are national roads, 3,000 kilometers are state roads, and 20,000 kilometers are village roads. Roads are classified into three levels: the first level has an excellent road base and cables and is flawless for transportation; the second level is well-constructed and capable of handling general transportation; and the third level is poorly constructed and of little transportation importance. Only about 700 kilometers of national roads belong to the first level, and very few belong to the second level, only about 1,300 kilometers. Most of the third-level roads are in remote areas. Therefore, improving road transportation is essential to meet the frequent needs.</p>
<p>Brazilian Highway Fund: Brazil is a large country in South America. Until 1927, its road administration was solely under the jurisdiction of the state governments. The central government only took the form of supervision, but it did not establish a special agency for road supervision. Later, as the value of roads gradually increased, the general public believed that improving roads was an urgent matter. The government then established a road bureau within the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry to study road transportation. Since January 1928, it has implemented construction-related financial measures. The implementation and maintenance of the measures were also formulated and announced. The Road Bureau was established, and all matters related to this were transferred to the newly established Road Bureau. The collection of funds is specialized in the collection of a certain percentage of surtax on the import tax of gasoline, automobiles, car chassis, tires, automatic bicycles, and automobile accessories. The funds are used to cover the initial annual amount of 4,672,000 yuan. The tax revenue in 1927 was only 2,553,652 yuan. Because the law was implemented late, only half of the revenue was collected.</p>

<p>Our gunners were all killed, with no ammunition and no soldiers left. The entire ship was filled with smoke and fire. The captain, wanting to save the surviving crew members, steered the ship towards the shore.</p>
<p>I was in the engine room on the starboard side, which had already caught fire. When we received the order to open the seacocks and go to the deck, the engine's crankshaft had already struck the water's surface, turning into white foam. We followed the order, but the enemy's artillery fire had destroyed the engine room beyond repair. Out of twenty people, only two were able to follow the order and go to the deck; the rest were either killed by the artillery fire or lost their lives from the boiling water shooting out of the ruptured steam pipes. I and an older petty officer were exceptionally fortunate to escape the disaster. I almost lost my life from the surge while opening the seacocks, but luckily, a stream of oil saved me.</p>
<p>The clothes on my body were completely torn apart. At first, I didn't realize I was naked until I reached into my pocket and realized I was completely bare. The fact that I had no pockets and no clothes made me very embarrassed.</p>
<p>I climbed onto the deck from a hole. Shells were still exploding everywhere. Through the thick smoke and flames, I saw huge waves rushing towards the deck. I thought we were certain to be completely submerged. Others may have had this thought as well, because they jumped into the water, away from the sinking ship. Just as I was about to follow them, it seemed as if my guardian angel stopped me from jumping into the water. I turned around, went through the smoke and flames, and went to the starboard side, where Captain Maulu was rescuing the injured. The smoke and flames were slightly less intense than before. Everyone cheered, seemingly forgetting everything. We saw our flag fluttering at the top of the mast. At this moment, a wounded and bleeding soldier staggered forward from beside a destroyed cannon, shouting, "Three cheers for the captain!" In an instant, this man fell to the deck. This soldier was permanently silenced.</p>
<p>April 6th. German troops occupied the French Sixth Army's positions west of Saint-Gobaain, between the Oise River and the Aisne Canal. The Sixth Army had already anticipated this battle on the enemy's side. Although the Sixth Army had penetrated deep north of the canal, it was only guarded by a few outposts. Therefore, the German troops advanced in scattered formations. They retreated upon seeing the battle. However, the enemy advanced cautiously. It took four days to advance to the Aisne Canal (April 6th to 9th). (To be continued)</p>
