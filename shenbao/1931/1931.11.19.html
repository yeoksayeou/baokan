<p>（巴黎）　今日理事會秘密會議、於下午一時零七分散會、各理事所討論者、大部份關於純粹理論的問題、對於實際解决辦法、絕少進步、（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今日上午國聯理事會舉行秘密會議時、各理事之討論集中於調和英法美三國對於中日條約及其與東三省事件關係之見解、而確定九國公約之尊嚴、尤爲此中主要討論問題、蓋美國務卿史汀生雖曾於談片中表示美國業經考量施用制裁問題、但理事會迄今所會商者、猶未軼出討論條約之外也、今日十二國理事在法外部舉行秘密會議時、白里安主席、中日代表俱未參加、聞海氏與羅斯福氏所倡中國門户開放政策之能否接受問題、實在今日秘密會議中居於最重要地位、據稱、理事會之確定目標、雖在日軍撤退問題、而此時所用策略、則在防免中日代表在理事會對於解决辦法獲得一致同意前、作籠罩一切之宣言、因目下理事會所最關切者、厥爲商得一致同意、决不容對中國有特殊利益之存在、而日代表芳澤則正欲作一冗長之公開宣言、要求承認日本在東省之特殊利益及讓與權與投資、以故十二國理事之秘密會議、欲阻止此種宣言之發表、至美代表道威斯此時則正忙於向各理事、尤其向中日代表鄭重聲明美國不能放棄其反對在華特殊利益之傳統政策、道氏雖未實際參加理事會正式討論、但對於理事會正取一種地位、表示美國認爲欲其違反一八九九年以來所抱之對華政策、决非美人所能加以思考者也（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今日午後各理事重作秘密外交談話、白里安昨夜因室内過熱、突抱小恙後、今日仍出而周旋、但顯然未曾全愈、晨間雖與道威斯作長談、但料日内至少須節勞數日、將主席所辦之日常公務、大部份託西門代勞、法政界則竭力否認白氏之病、帶有政治性質、由於不能挽救國聯危殆局勢之失望所致、聲稱、白氏確係眞病、而國聯亦未入危殆之境云、（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日午前行政院舉行秘密會議、至午後一時始散、西門·柴來斯基·勒樂·蒲洛諸氏均宣言稱、各該國政府必以全力贊助行政院、而爲國聯會增加威信、午後四時行政院又將舉行非公開會議、分别聽取中日兩國代表意見、（十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　聞日政府須先承認其五項基本要則、然後可允由國聯主持、遣派混合委員團前往滿洲調查、向行政會報告、此乃日本折中辦法之基礎、時局嚴重、漸達極點、今晨秘密會議兩小時、散會後、未發公報、議長白里安力言維護國聯會章之必要、英代表西門俄代表道夫迦勒夫斯基贊成其言、國聯方面乃大興奮、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　行政會决議於今日午後再開秘密會議、並邀請中日代表分别出席、各陳述其意見、今晨再議時、白里安報告其與日代表之談話、聞日代表業已提出具體辦法、係以日本五要點爲根據、或可爲一種諒解之基礎、行將提示施肇基、故施對此之態度、極關重要也、美國務卿史汀生所發美國準備贊助國聯所採任何計劃之言論、已發生甚有力之印象、衆信此言當可使中國之態度爲之堅强、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯行政會定今晨十一時再舉行非公開會議一次、旣不寫紀録、且不許無責任者入室、中日代表皆未被請與會、屆時如收到日收表復文、則白里安將宣讀之、上次日内瓦之最後會議、因日代表與東京通電延緩、致稍延時日、此次松平來助各事、可從速進行、聞松平在未接行政會正式請求時、已向東京覓取行政會所索之資料矣、松平在幕後與西門時有接觸、但進步甚微、小巴黎人報稱、芳澤已將關於各條約、即以在滿權利賦予日本者之細則、供給白里安、小巴黎人報又</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>吾人能坐視馬占山孤軍抗暴乎</h3>
<p>馬占山將軍以孤軍守土抗暴。誓拼生死其對人言。謂「我與部下皆抱抗戰到底决心。將來兵縱完了。亦必率民團與日人拼到底。」此種精忠貫日悲壯激越之言。如聞其聲。如見其人。此倔立寒塞荒漠與强敵角逐之男兒。誠爲我國家民族精神之所寄托。</p>
<p>最近有英美記者往訪將軍。并周察馬部陣地。謂「馬占山吳松山英勇無敵。軍士氣旺團結如鐡。已爲世界最能戰之軍隊。」並謂「日軍源源增多黑軍無援。日即將利用中國各省中立態度。舉全力攻黑最堪憂處。」末更深致其慨嘆。謂「中國政府及北平百萬軍人。坐視一省抗一國而不救。在吾儕歐美人眼光觀之。殊爲駭異。」吁。此何言歟。我政府我國人聽斯言。而尙能不爲之羞慚感動投袂而起耶</p>
<p>馬以孤軍。隔處荒漠。在無抵抗命令之下。本可不拼死命。與虎狼之衆抗衡也。而且當其與强敵出死入生肉搏鏖戰之際。萬福麟之子萬國賓。復席捲黑省庫欵一千一百萬潛遁。庫空如洗。糧秣艱難。三軍糧絕。兩日不食。處此環境之下。馬固亦可知難而退。棄士脫逃也。日本大軍源源續調而來。飛機利砲。將大增加。以絕虞無援之孤軍。終難抗禦。馬亦非不知其情勢之必無幸也。然而環境愈益艱難。士氣越益激越。振臂一呼。瘡痍盡起。衛國守土。百折不回。國家有此良將。人民有此好軍人。誠足以振我衰頽而寒敵膽。據十七日消息。日軍已將新增調之日軍第八混成旅團全部運洮昂線。將大舉攻黑。然而我國内百餘萬軍隊。仍坐視孤軍奮鬭。迄至此緊急危難之秋。猶未聞有積極之援助。其視黑省爲非中國土地耶。如其非然。則我政府積極予馬部以實力之救援。與糧秣之接濟。此時實萬不容刻緩。</p>
<p>吾人猶記甲午清日戰爭之役。外人評論謂日本非與中國戰。特與直隸一省戰非與直隸一省戰與北京政府戰。非與北京政府戰。特與李鴻章一人戰。冷峭之評。活畫出我民族精神之渙散。甲午迄今已二十餘年。歲月邁逝。而情景則一如昨日。國人之無團結力不長進亦一如昨日。在二十餘年後之今日。吾人復聽歐美記省。「中國政府及北平百萬軍人坐視一省抗一國而不救」之評論。此實我民族無上之恥辱。誰應負此責任。我民衆敢抗聲質問。</p>
<p>日來人民自動輸財捐充馬軍餉糈者。日益踴躍。粤東有弱女子以電力股票押欵二萬五千元。全部匯黑。毁家救國。本埠東南醫藥院學生。亦有多人自動組織救護隊。赴黑援助馬軍之說。凡此種種。皆可證人民固未嘗坐視馬將軍之孤軍奮鬥。而不爲其後盾也。民氣兹已可用矣。政府尙不積極奮起。更待何時。</p>
<p>更據十七日消息。國聯秘密會議。儗仍令中日直接交涉。國聯之態度。今已愈趨顯明。我將仍不作最後之準備。必俯首帖耳以坐待宰割耶。吾人今敢向我政府建議三點。</p>
<p>一以武力收回失地。</p>
<p>二充分予黑軍以實力之援助。</p>
<p>三勒令萬國賓繳回捲逃之省庫。</p>
<p>斯時已爲最後之時機。全體人民深盼我政府能當機而立斷。</p>

<p>（巴黎）　今日談話甚多、但中日兩國間關於滿洲問題之要求、依然距離甚遠、日本態度似無改變、有之、則視前稍硬、故衆認此事之解决、必歷時甚久、行政會最大困難、與日本條約權之程度與範圍有關、大約將以西門等重要人物組織有力的股員會、以考慮此點、據巴黎辯論報云、行政會現所傾向之解决法、爲造成一種良好空氣、便於中日直接談判、而附以此項談判開始後、國聯對其進行、加以密切注視之諒解、衆望此種辦法、或可應付中國對於直接談判之反對云、巴黎時報稱、國聯行政會之工作、僅爲保障和平、如會章第十一條所規定耳、保障之道、在採取和緩與應變之方法、以期促成由雙方直接談判之和平解决云、今日討論集中於中日兩國立塲之比較、西門發言頗多、但最後行政會决定現未有充分資料可對於日本所要求承認之條約下一判語、有會員數人、以爲中日條約有若干件、純屬經濟性質、與其謂爲有效問題、不如謂爲解釋問題、故若剔出眞正爭點、則可獲一大進步、行政會會員未必同意於駁斥事實上政府所簽定之條約、尤其是中國所稱在威脅下所簽定之一九一五年條約、但關於鐡路敷設權之一九零五年條約中之秘密條文、及關於轉讓俄國在滿權利之一八九八年條約、則宜提交仲裁、此種條約、固不涉及日人之安全也、以上</p>

<p>（巴黎）　巴黎華人輿情、以爲滿洲現狀、</p>
<p>現亟待實際解决、理論問題如條約等、不妨留待日後不再流血時、再作最後之討論、如日人不信任華人有保護其人民之能力、則華人不反對由中立國人委員會監視華人諾言之實行、據華人見解、條約問題甚爲複雜、辦理需時、不應與日本撤兵同時討論、凡國際有效之各種條約、即可以忠實履行、而不礙及中國所簽其他條約之條文者、華人當然承認之、中國遵守一九二二年華盛頓條約、此約亦爲日人所簽定、規定中國開放門户主義、但開放門户之規定、與中國認爲威逼簽定之一九一五年條約之某種需要、大相抵觸、此乃時局中之關鍵、中國準備將此種法律難題提交任何適當形式之公斷、但决不能在日軍仍佔據中國土地之時準備單獨與日本討論從前條約之解釋、或將來條約之條欵云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>日人陜溥儀離津經過</h3>
<p>北平通信、當本月二日自稱「支那通」之土肥原偕金梁到津後、即曾往謁溥儀、勸其出關復辟、溥儀不敢允諾、土肥原即以危詞恫嚇、悻悻而去、六日之夜、溥宅即發現炸彈於菓物筐中、蓋亦土肥原之威逼把戲也、同時土肥原等又别尋蹊徑、與金梁偕往遺老鄭孝胥處詳述復辟計畫、謂若溥儀復辟、則日本必以實力援助、鄭之頭腦簡單、祇知忠君而不知愛國、益以其子炎佐利禄薰心、慫恿其父、謂中華民國實有負於皇室、（大約係指驅逐出宫及停給優待費等）現旣有此機會、大可利用日人、以雪此恥、縱令失敗、而最低限度、亦可如朝鮮之李王移居東京、享受清福云云、鄭爲所動、遂亦贊成、即偕土肥原金梁謁溥儀、作種種之誘勸、溥儀本一童騃、焉知大勢、惟因清室舊員尙多反對、且日方欲溥儀另建國號、尤不滿意、頗露躊躇之意、於是鄭金兩人復與土肥原磋商、最後土肥原謂溥儀先生如肯復辟、則關於國號一層、或另建新名、或恢復舊稱、均無不可、即沿用宣統年號亦無妨碍目下惟請溥先生先赴大連、萬事皆可從長商量云云、金梁與鄭孝胥又以此餂於溥儀、以昏庸之童騃、經内外之交逼、遂不顧一切、决心重温其皇帝之舊夢矣、土肥原煽惑之計劃、旣已成功、又恐華方對此事加以注意、爲移轉視線計、乃賣收張壁李際春等、招集便衣隊、而有八日天津之事變、溥儀即於便衣隊滋擾最烈之十日夜間、挈其父載澄與其妻並太監三人及土肥原金梁鄭孝胥並其子炎佐等、微服離津、乘輪赴大連而去、（十六日）</p>
<p>天津通信、自民國十三年溥儀被迫離平後、即卜居津門日租界中、已歷七載、日人早有計畫、以爲奇貨可居、特别加以保護、前年溥儀本有出洋游歷之意、旋因日友勸阻、致未果行、此次日軍强佔遼吉、意在永久佔據、顧爲顧慮國際起見、不得不組一傀儡政府、實際上自握軍政大權、此幕戲劇、自非擁廢帝溥儀、難以號召、故始派土肥原來津、土肥原於中國情形甚熟、並能說華語、抵津之後、即由日駐津司令香椎介紹、往晤溥儀、溥儀明知日方利用彼爲一時傀儡、初頗不願、土肥原再三勸誘、彼均以婉詞謝絕、最後土肥原勃然作色、謂「日本政府保護君等安全、已歷數年、今欲助君恢復清室、實屬仁至義盡、如果不聽我言、恐殺身之禍即在目前、溥儀經此威嚇後、乃請從緩商量、旋與其遣老鄭孝胥陳實琛朱益藩等計議應付辦法、鄭謂時勢如此、祗得暫從、惟陳朱兩氏、反對甚力、謂不去則死、去亦安全難保、並失民國同情、溥亦躊躇不决、是時溥儀私宅、早由日人監視、對外交通、完全失去自由、經數日之掙扎、結果不得不受脅赴瀋、於十日晚十二時左右、率其妻及太監三人、由私宅動身、鄭孝胥等亦隨行、並有武裝日兵數名在後保護、至日租界碼頭、乘小汽船、經特三區英法兩租界特一區沿岸而下、抵塘沽改乘日本驅逐艦刈萱號離津、現聞已抵大連矣、</p>
<h3>津市危機尙伏</h3>
<p>津當局雖委曲求全</p>
<p>便衣隊尙騷擾不已</p>
<p>天津通信、在八日夜間便衣隊由日租界向中國各機關進攻、我地方警察及保安隊爲自衛計、不得已而開槍、因爲便衣隊旣由日租界襲來、則保安警察射擊、流彈自易飛入日租界、故於九日上午五時半便衣隊勢不能支之時、日本司令官香椎突向我第二軍部用電話提出抗議、謂中國軍警（其實當時祗有保安隊並無軍隊）向日租界開槍、將其官兵射死數名、應即飭令軍警即刻後退三百米達、否則日軍爲自衛計、即採必要之手段、所謂必要之手段、質言之、即係自由行動也、省市當局爲息事寗人計、遂委曲求全、下令警察後退三百米達、不意我愈退讓、日愈逼緊、不特便衣隊連日擾亂如故而所退出之三百米達、日方幾視如日租界之附屬地、處處干涉我方行動、前日日領突向我方提議、由中日雙方會同檢查此三百米達地域内有無便衣隊、在日方用意無非慮英美等國或主張將三百米達劃爲緩衝地帶、則日租界被各國封鎖、無從活動、所以一面運用外交手腕、飾詞朦蔽各國、一方請求中國會同搜查、不知便衣隊旣受日人之指揮、當然不會株守被獲、且此三百米達内係中國元全領土、搜與不搜、中國自有權衡、縱然有搜查之必要、亦不須日方提議、而我當局竟允日方之要求、會同搜查、原定十二日上午十時舉行、屆時我方派保安隊一隊到閘口、接洽檢查辦法、日兵竟怒目相向拒絕檢查、嗣我方向日領質問爽約、日領謂非爽約、乃係繙譯者將日期弄錯、兹定十四日上午九時會同檢查、及十四日上午、我方派保安隊四十名、日方派憲兵四十名、各派文武官一員率領、分成兩組、第一組在閘口、第二組在海光寺、</p>
<p>並由日副領事後藤招待外賓、隨同參觀其用意實甚深遠、第一組查全距閘口約二百米達之電話二局門前、日館嘷然大譁、謂此處在三百米達内不應有電網土袋等防禦工事、經我方告以電話局關係中外人民之交通、不能無相當之防備、日方竟不諒解、遂中止檢查、第二組由海光寺方面開始、而被日軍佔據之二區六所、日方竟拒絕檢查、結果保安隊遂祇在馬路上走走、敷衍子事、因此預定檢查後日兵撤退五十米達、中日警</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>察恢復崗位、亦未能實現、日領更藉題發揮、一而致電日本外務省、一面通告駐津各國領事、聲稱「本月八日夜中國暴徒騷動、與中國軍警發生巷戰、日本武官及日兵飲彈而亡、中國接受駐津日領事之警告、於九日黎明退距日租界三百米達以外、此爲共見共聞之事、乃中國方面宣稱連日以來在此三百米達發現便衣隊、爲肅清暴徒起見、遂於十四日雙方各派軍警會同檢查、竟在三百米達内發現電網土囊等防禦工事、顯係中國不守信義、檢查結果、並無便衣隊踪影、可以證明日本絕無庇護暴徒之事、而在民宅中查獲保安隊三名、即係開槍射殺日本官兵之人」云云、一面又電日使署、請向我外部抗議、一面逕向省市當局抗議、並要求市府當局親到日館道歉、市長張學銘因自事變發生後、已一星期未得眠息、致患喉頭炎、於十四日晚六時派代表寗向南到日領館、說明張市長因病不能來、日領不悅、謂因病不能來、則須用書面正式道歉、十五日下午、張派第二軍參議劉家鸞携道歉函送往日領館、王樹常則於十五日下午四時半、偕沈迪家寗向南、赴海光寺日本兵營、與日司令香椎會見、日兵全武裝環繞數匝、大有鴻門宴之概、至八時三十分王氏被迫承認下列三條件、（一）十一月十四日中日會同檢查便衣隊時、發見在接近日租界三百米達内有防禦工事、保安隊槍口向日租界、謹向日當局道歉、（二）取締與日本名譽有礙之宣傳、（三）三百米達内之防禦工事撤銷、保安隊不得進入此區域内、但警察得佩手槍服務、八時四十分繕成日文、由王氏簽字畢、始得出日兵營而回華界、</p>
<p>電話二局門前之電網、昨（十五）午已實行撤去、保安隊亦向後撤退、我當局請日方將日兵佔據之二區六所交還、並將各路口之日兵後退五十米達、恢復中日警察崗位、日當局不但未允、且更進一步要求我方將南關下頭之中西女學校撥作日軍辦公處、并將軍隊撤退二十里外、昨夜十時四十分、海光寺一帶又發現便衣隊二千餘人、向我防線進攻、我保安隊因奉令停止放槍、乃用電話向市府請示辦法、張學銘當即電日兵營、謂頃據報告、海光寺方面發現便衣隊二千餘名、向我進攻甚激、我方爲防禦起見、即須開槍、請勿誤會、香椎謂保安隊開槍與否、悉聽尊便、惟子彈不得射入日兵營及日租界、實則便衣隊旣在海光寺方面竄出、離日兵營甚近、則方迎擊、流彈極易飛入、香椎此等聲明、顯係與我爲難、旋因便衣隊愈逼愈近、已直迫我方防地、保安隊不得已乃開槍抵抗、至夜十二時半、始將暴徒擊退、在十一時半激戰正烈時、日兵又開砲助威、隆隆之聲震耳、在牆子河外防守之英美法兵固皆聞悉、總之、現在已由暴徒騷動、而變爲中日直接周旋、蒿目前途、隠憂正鉅也、（十六日）</p>

<p>日來東三省事件、幾乎全靠國聯解决、國聯行政</p>

<h3>怎樣纔是抵制日貨切實有效方法</h3>
<p>— 鄭鴻笙</p>
<p>抵制日貨、專靠少數人呼號奔走、斷不能各處普及、而且永久有效的、欲求切實普遍辦法、須有一種常設機關、於無形中、在各處消費市塲裏、努力倡導、注意研究、使一般民衆自願不購仇貸、久而久之、則仇貨自絕跡於我市場矣、兹擬方案如下、（一）由全國各地商會設立商品研究所、（無商會之處亦得由相當機關設立）、其任務約、</p>
<p>舉如下、（一）鑑别商品屬於何國出品（二）研究商品品質之優劣、（三）調查商品之銷路、（四）研究國貨替代方法、（五）介紹國貨、上列研究所、最好由上海市商會先行發起、擬定章程、通函各地商會一律設立、（二）舉行商品調查、研究所設立後、即進行商品調查事宜、爲達到任務之目的調查表式舉例如下、</p>
<p>商品名稱　商標　出品者　　　　　鑑别法　　　　　　優劣點　　　　價格　　　　　　　銷路備考</p>
<p>味精　　　佛手　中國天廚味精廠　有吳藴初發明字樣　滋味鮮潔純素　中號每瓶四角八分</p>
<p>味の素　　　　　日本鈴木商店　　瓶裝罐裝均有東洋字　用途相同以金匯關係價較貴</p>
<p>火柴　　　鳳凰　瑞典　　　　　　不潮　　　　　　　銅元四枚</p>
<p>火柴　　　美麗　中國大中華公司　梗數較多經用　　　銅元三枚</p>
<p>右表内所載係就記憶所及、假定塡入、此外如近今天翔織造廠所出之毛背駝絨、國貨原料研究會之發明與日貨同等醬色、皆足爲調查之資料、以期從事推廣國貨、此項調查、如由津粤滬漢各商會、分門别類、先行調查明晰、印發各地參考、則各地祗須依樣分塡表格、或擇要復查一遍、實貼各商店門首、任人觀覽、（三）商品標記、凡各商店陳列各種商品、均須用標記標明出品國籍、此項標記、可由研究所視商品質量情形、分别代製、酌收成本、分發應用、這樣調查明白、則各商店似不敢公然售賣仇貨、亦不敢糊裡糊塗、以仇貨冒充國貨或他國貨、而一般民衆、亦曉然於商品品質之優劣、國貨之有無替代、於購買時、知所取擇、事輕易舉、收效必宏、此外如隨時向平民隊裏宣傳演講、尤足輔助此事之進行也、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>馬關和議成。而臺灣割讓。時論咸歸咎議和大臣李鴻章。其實日本固屬意於遼吉黑三省。李堅持不允。所以割臺灣者。不得已而思其次也。其時日本民衆。咸以不得東省。責備伊籐博文。竟有挾刄求見者。迨和約訂定。李深知臺人中。必有頑抗者。乃派其子經芳交割。臺民大譁。推巡撫唐景崧。爲伯里璽天得。劉永福爲統帥。舉兵對抗。日軍水陸並進。劉扼守台北。誘敵深入。四面包抄。殲敵無算。劉以部下黑旗兵三千人。轉戰台南北。苦鬥三閱月。待至彈盡餉絕。始扯白旗投降。日軍信以爲眞。派陸戰隊上陸接收。霹靂一聲。地雷爆發。日軍死傷數百人。而劉早化裝乘英國船遠遁矣。</p>
<h3>薪胆餘風録</h3>
<p>— 抱琴軒主</p>
<p>吾越爲越王勾踐臥薪嘗胆之地。現代革命先烈。如秋女俠·徐錫麟·陶成章輩。均産生其間。蓋遺澤餘風。歷千百年而勿替也。最近暴日逞兇。舉國切齒。抗日救國之聲。沸盈全國。而越中竟有老孀·牧豎·學究·博徒輩。慷慨激昻。圖雪國仇者。是則不可以無記也。作薪胆餘風録。</p>
<p>女中卜式　距城三十里。有村曰朱儲。村多陳姓。有老孀單氏。年六十餘矣。無子。一女適鄰村傅姓。氏夫在日。業絲綢。家頗小康。夫死已十餘年。氏擁有二萬金之遺産。固無虞凍餒。一日抗日宣傳隊至該村演講。氏亦雜人叢中聽講。聽至日軍暴行。我國軍民遭難慘狀。不覺老淚橫流。語隊中人曰。番兵猖獗如是。豈中國竟無一捍衛國家之忠臣耶。吾老矣。又無子息。如中國與日本開戰。願輸家産之半。以助軍餉。蓋氏亦曾讀書識字。平日岳傳三國等舊小說。爲其唯一之消遣品。老婦有此卓識。方諸漢之卜式。何多讓也。</p>
<p>剷除污點　牧豎阿四。東浦人。幼失怙恃。依其叔度日。叔命阿四牧羊。阿四牧羊處。有一古廟。墻上繪巨大之味の素廣告。阿四牧羊時。以小刀刮壁。三日後。下方廣告已被刮去。惟上方因人短不及。阿四乃携竹梯來。繼續刮壁。適爲廟祝所見。責其毁壤廟壁。阿四侃侃爭辯。謂此係日貨廣告。豈可容其存在。今我刮去。實爲汝廟剷除污點。汝不德我。反責我耶。廟祝語塞。竟無如之何。</p>
<p>特别說書　賞家村馮某。一前清之不第秀才也。設塾授徒。迂態可掬。顧馮雖頭腦冬烘。然對於時事。極爲注意。每散課後。輒至村中閱報社閱報。自東北事變發生後。馮之閱報。更形起勁。馮每晚必至小茶肆啜茗。平時不過隨意閒談。近則專講日人之暴行。取材報紙。自行增减。效法說書。口講指畫。淋漓盡致。聽者多爲動容。近日小茶肆之生涯。竟因之而盛。蓋鄕人均來聽此特别說書也。</p>
<p>磨礪以須　與馮同村有癩三寳者。藉博爲生。性戇直。富膂力。一言不合。輒揮老拳。以故人咸畏避之。三寳自聽馮講述日人暴行後。不勝憤恨。特命鐡肆製一純鋼匕首。日夕玩弄。每逢博勝。不拘多寡。必提出半數。存儲於其妻舅所設之小雜貨肆。或問其買刀儲錢之意。三寳毅然曰。匕首請本莊繁·土肥原·芳澤等惡賊受用。儲錢則預備赴東北之旅費耳。人有諷其痴者。然三寳絕不爲動。磨礪以須。誓欲一擊爲快也。</p>
<h3>好馬</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>我國十餘年來。此起彼仆。無日不在内戰之中。所謂蠻觸之爭。同室操戈。勝不爲榮。言之痛心。惟有此次黑省馬占山將軍。能以孤軍禦暴日。連日苦戰。挫彼兇鋒。如此戰績。纔值得國人景仰。看他抗日的通電。慷慨陳詞。讀之令人忠勇之氣。油然而生。以垂斃的東北。有這一員勇將。支持危局。足使倭寇側目。所以國民對這位馬將軍。要表示十二萬分的敬意。衆口一詞。喝一聲采道。「好馬」</p>
<h3>贈馬占山將軍</h3>
<p>— 无咎</p>
<p>二十萬人同解甲。將軍獨挽魯陽戈。張家豚犬羞應死。可識龍江馬伏波。</p>
<h3>懷馬占山將軍</h3>
<p>— 石楚青</p>
<p>愁看東北戰雲漫。一戰先摧敵膽寒。齊道將軍多古誼。祇緣鐡石是忠肝。</p>
<p>誓抒國難著奇勳。砥柱中流羣仰君。刁斗聲沈山月黑。貔貅十萬一將軍。</p>
<h3>國府路上之三種聲</h3>
<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>悽愴聲　有不侫之江北大同鄕。高郵阿二者。其個人之生活。即拉包車營業是也。而阿二嫂并非嬌生慣養。喜吃愛好之流。是以不甘於乃夫獨苦。故每於溽暑聲中。吾人香夢正酣。晨曦未出之際。輒爲阿二嫂。高唱賣洋糖熱粽子之聲所驚醒。因其聲音清脆而悽。如空谷猿啼。嫠婦夜泣。旣不忍聞。而又無從避免。因時晨在早間。所謂有朝氣。尚無若何痛苦。頃阿二嫂以時屆冬令。粽子不打自倒。刻已於下晝改賣葵花子矣。因其時有暮氣。故聞之愈覺悽愴也。</p>
<p>賣報聲　首都自暴日侵犯。甘冒不韙以來。上海之申新兩大報。銷數銳增。每晚六七時後。如向報販購此兩大報。多摇首無以應。足見大難臨頭。關心國事者。固大有人在也。至國府路上。於魚更初躍後。輒聞得多數小兒。呌賣各種晚報聲。高徹雲表。此唱彼和。頗爲熱閙也。</p>
<p>車馬聲　首都車馬之多。雖滬上亦不及。至其車聲最複雜之處。當以國府路爲最。按國府之左。有小火車站。車每日來往十數次。晨光熹微時開。至深夜始歇。而國府後面有行政院。又有文官·參軍·主計·等處及參謀部等機關。至國府右首。又爲去中央大學·敎育部·考試院·及往下關之孔道。故每日清早至深夜。輒聞嗚嗚汽車聲。轔轔馬車聲。得得馬蹄聲。鐺鐺包車鈴聲。及小火車之放汽聲。聲聲響應。無一刻寗。斯眞四方輻輳。車馬雜沓之處矣。</p>
<h3>記嚴氏葫蘆字藝</h3>
<p>— 炎</p>
<p>小說家嚴芙孫君之葫蘆測字。論斷神妙。遐邇知名。凡往問字停車者。無不稱頌其神。其决斷之字。由悶葫蘆中打破而出。深具巧思。自然靈妙。其案頭備字典全部。隨意點定兩字。亦可當機立斷。神速無比。嚴氏久被二竪所侵。已將館庽遷至法租界大馬路南側西自來火街立賢里。顧以貧病交迫。祇得勉力開硯絞腦嘔心。生涯良苦。葫蘆測字。百事可占。現定全日開筆。予之戚友。最近往叩數事。應騐如響。擇録一二。藉供談助。</p>
<p>友人劉君。擬赴津門。瀕行。往古「厄」「少」二字。嚴立斷曰。厄字露「角」必「危」。少字因「止」成「步」。彼處危機潛伏。不如止步爲宜。劉聞而遲疑。遂中止其行。預計抵津之日。適暴徒禍作之頃。葫蘆可稱神數。</p>
<p>東華足球隊。與諾森堡之戰。初屆登塲。嚴氏以「甬」「卡」二字。斷謂雙方有勇無力。彼此没有上下。結果。各吃鴨蛋。竟成和局。日前决賽。一般球迷。推曁大吳君。前往問字。在悶葫蘆中。搖出「金」「月」二字。嚴曰。前金後月。「金」字爲破「釜」之象。「月」字左面。加「券」成「勝」。則此次抱破釜之决心。勝利可操左券矣。鏖戰結局。我軍馬到成功。數萬球迷。皆大歡喜。而君平鐡筆。足與我之鐡軍相映。亦一佳話也。</p>
<p>茂新鞋廠司賬黄某。因沈溺跑狗。迷不知反。曾在葫蘆中。搖出「昔」「狺」兩字珠。嚴氏决曰。先測「昔」字。固已無「手」可「措」。終測「狺」字。終恐因「犬」成「獄」耳。黃不信。浸淫如故。旬前。果以跑狗虧負。私挪公欵。以侵佔罪下獄。字機悉騐。三牌樓彭福記眼鏡作夥彭永生。今春。偕同鄕胡志霖往叩流年。搖占「儉」「佳」二字。嚴曰。「儉」字推敲。「人」立「險」境。「佳」字外觀固屬佳象。但進而研討。適爲「焦」字之頭。今歲倘不速離。恐罹「焦頭」爛額之慘。當時嚴氏憑理直斷。不料日前彭福記火警。彭永生不幸葬身其中。最奇者。竟符焦頭之讖。此事由胡姓傳出。嚴氏葫蘆。其仙矣乎。</p>
<h3>睇嚮齋逞談</h3>
<p>— 甘簃</p>
<p>王瑚</p>
<p>人生於世。不能不無毁譽。而毁譽之來。皆由人而作。要視言者之如何而定也。譽王瑚者。謂其持躬儉約。服官廉明。治事勤奮。毁王瑚者。謂其沽名釣譽。欺世盜名。譽者之言可信耶。毁者之語有當耶。而是非固未嘗無公論也。瑚字鐡珊。籍直隸。入翰林。散館授知縣。令四川筠連。有文翁之譽其時岑雲階（春萱）撫廣西。耳其賢。疏調入桂。檄統一軍。春萱晋粤督。薦爲欽廉兵備道。欽廉諸郡宿多匪。瑚率所部與匪戰。敗潰。城陷。褫職查辦。久之。東督錫清弼（良）疎請復其原官。授吉林東南路道。論政無私。治事務勤。入民國。累爲令於直隸。超擢京兆尹。移湖南巡按使。未之官。内授肅政史。有鐡面御史之目。齊耀珊久筦蘇民政。求去。蘇督李純薦數人于政府。以瑚列首。政府乃免耀珊職。令瑚繼任。瑚濡滯北都。不行。一日。滿城喧傳新省長已至。且入居署内。擇日受事。相顧大異。蓋瑚乘津浦車。微服渡江。獨步至小火車站。（南京通城内外之火車。曰小火車。）登車進城。復獨步趨省署。守衛阻之。曰。爾來。拜會何人。瑚笑而不答。但云。吾自有資格入内。守衛不敢專。乞示其長某。某北人。睹瑚面。似曾相識。知瑚平日好喬裝施公一流人物。姑鞠躬致敬曰。公得毋新省長耶。曰。然。某曰。待久矣。偕入。從者數人亦自他途而至。爲外間所聞。投謁者盈門。旣受事。候補道尹某詣謁。瑚令啟中門。親迎於階下。肅容曰。督辦别來無恙耶。某囁嚅無以應。稍坐。呼送客。某終未及一語。内不自安。自後凡三謁。瑚無不如是。蓋瑚令蜀時。某以道員任清鄕督辦。嘗揭瑚之短於大府。瑚以官卑不敢抗。至是。始予滑稽之報復。故終瑚之任。某不獲用。去而之他。其行類如此。或曰。瑚以邑宰歴階至疆吏。能實踐所謂「文官不要錢」之旨。品格自高大一等。而其人器小易盈。矯情好譽。要無可掩飾也。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（二十一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>肉是近來上海最時髦的流行品。影戲院不論來了一張什麽影片，登起廣告來，總是用了極大的木刻，寫着「肉感」「肉感」的字樣。無論那裏出了一部小說，也是什麽「肉」啊，「靈」啊，沉醉於肉的描寫中啊。更有所謂鹹肉莊的名目，比了嫖堂子還要便當。當塲交易，現貨賣買，敎上海人，非上海人，都去做了漢朝的陳平，大家去宰它一刀。</p>
<p>因爲肉足以動人，於是肉色也就時髦起來了。鄕下人想：這是我看錯了。起初我看見有幾位姑娘，身上穿得很漂亮，却疑心他們爲甚的不穿襪子，還以爲是夏天的緣故。此刻方纔弄明白了。那末我剛纔看見這裏店鋪子裏，有幾個夥計，都赤了膊。大概他也没有赤過膊，不過每人穿了一件肉色汗衫罷了。</p>
<p>那位姑娘，還是把鄕下人一把拖住不放。</p>
<p>「放了手，有話好説。」鄕下人在被圍中了。他被一個女人，在馬路上拖住，也覺得有點不好意思。</p>
<p>「我們因爲這兩天生意不好，在這裏燒燒路頭，爲什麽要你來踏熄了？觸我們的霉頭。」</p>
<p>「燒路頭？怎麽不到家裏去燒去？却在沿街燒。」</p>
<p>「在家裏燒，在沿路燒，都不關你事。你不應該來觸我們的霉頭。」那位姑娘扭住了鄕下人，一定不放他。</p>
<p>幸虧有一個路人，知道鄕下人被圍了，急來解勸。他道：「他是一片好意，怕你們燒破了衣服，誰知道你們是燒什麽路頭呢？踏熄了火，有什麽大不了事，你們再弄一點亂紙頭燒燒就是了。」</p>
<p>幾句話兒，方始把鄕下人解了圍。鄕下人連忙謝了這位解圍朋友，一面喘著氣說道：</p>
<p>「這一班女人是做什麽的？好兇狠啊！伊的氣力，比我們男人還大，被伊拉住了，竟灑也灑不脫咧。」</p>
<p>「這些都是野雞。他們齊集在這塊地方，你不去惹伊，伊還要向你拉拉扯扯。何况你又和他們去兜搭，他們看見你又不像老上海，只說你踏熄了他們燒路頭的火，借此要敲你的竹槓了。」</p>
<p>上海有許多的野雞妓女，鄕下人早聽人說過的了。却不想他們如此兇，竟將我包圍起來。怎麽上海地方，一任他們那樣的沿路拉人，並不去禁止他們。這是我們鄕下，决計没有那種不要臉的女人的。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市賣氣復盛</h3>
<p>紗市軟化、形勢甚弱、因時局惡化、銀根緊急、實銷益覺岑寂、各帮均告停滯、因金融奇枯、商業難以發展、所以多數人心、傾向抛出、故市勢遂疲云、</p>
<p>人標跌一兩外　人標前市開盤、以國事多難、人心不振、形勢閑散、各月跌一·三·五錢、午後聞現需不佳、賣氣又盛、各月跌八·九錢至一兩一錢、全日成交統計二萬六千一百包、查賣出明德一千三百五十包、源豐一千三百包、長豐六百五十包、和愼九百包、買進達記九百包、泰興三千一百包、賡豐九百五十包、益昶一千三百五十包、兹將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉市又入疲境</h3>
<p>棉市轉疲、因美棉不振、金市仍堅、然多頭乘漲時將多頭了結、實以現棉交易沉滯、各廠對於本棉、絕無問題意、且價格太高、均被外棉侵奪、所以棉市又趨軟化、本月份前有軋空之念、現以現棉交易停頓、銀拆奇緊、將購進之額吐出、故市盤遂鬆懈趨跌矣、</p>
<p>近期標多頭出籠　漢標前市開盤、以美棉平平、金價上漲、市氣稍昂、各月漲二錢、二三盤市氣轉疲、結果反跌一錢五分、午後近月多頭出籠　市况又鬆、各月跌一錢五分至二錢、全日成交統計七萬四千三百担、榮興一千九百担、賡豐五千一百担、義餘三千二百担、大豐一千九百担、買進長豐二千三百担、益豐二千七百擔、愼昌二千三百担、兹將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>海外棉稍見起色</h3>
<p>昨美棉先因雨水過多、賣户缺乏、市况平靜而堅、後因多頭了結而疲、計期貨漲跌一至三磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨漲二至四點、現貨漲一點、埃及棉現貨不動、印棉市况堅穏、計平果爾及奥奥辣漲二·七五羅比、白羅溪漲一·七五羅比、原電録左、（十七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市勢轉定</h3>
<p>南頭　昨裏路來源十七八號、浦江存船與蘇同帮約有三十餘號、本街胃口比前市爲旺、西新及早稻略有囤户、價漲一二角、薄稻寗胃雖動、惟數不多、行情喊起一角、中關米存積有點、故市銷不振、陰化糕糰店交易頗好、行情見漲一角</p>
<p>新閘　昨來源不多、城鄕交易呆滯、各店乘此檔口添辦存貨、故客方勒價、河下斛脚約有五千石左右、常錫新粳高貨見定、次貨漲起一二角、青角薄稻客帮略有應酬、市無升沉、客尖裝到寥寥、廠盤始終站定、北帮蘆洋尖貨缺、抬高五分至一角不等、糯米陰元市無榮辱、</p>
<h3>本街暢辦洋客秈</h3>
<p>昨洋米市况、因金價上漲、産價合大、洋行未有抛售期貨、而本街則辦胃轉暢、人心與市面乃見一致上升、計開出西貢一號五百包、價十一元半、小絞二千包、價十元零二角、期貨新交易未開、回籠貨成交六百噸、計小絞一月份四兩八錢三分、四月份過磅貨五兩一錢、五月份過磅貨五兩一錢六分、比之前市、則現貨各漲數分、期貨堅站、客秈則有台州米續到、隨市由本街辦去二千五百包、價十一元二角至十元零二角半、市面亦比前市爲佳、蓋因邇日本街胃口甚濃、人心均爲向上云、</p>
<h3>遠月粉廠家抛賣</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、曾一度呈堅挺之象、以洋麥報價、又漲五六角、金市亦未見回落、故開市後、近遠期均較前日回漲一二分不等、惟以後各盤、因廠方續出、及内地客户、均乘勢回出、市氣遂又步軟、迨至下午開盤、以實銷帮觀望不前、兼之洋麥之抛訂、又重新活動、觀廠家抛出違期、即可知洋麥之續有成交也、所以各月份市氣、均趨不振、結果本月份較前日跌一分三厘半、十二月份跌一分、一月份跌五厘、二月份跌一分、三月份跌七厘半、四月份跌一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥俏而復平</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈先俏後平之象、上午初以洋麥之報牌、近遠期大致好起二三分不等、惟至下午各盤、因粉市旣不佳、且洋麥之兜售、依然逐有活動、廠家一遇廉宜、即須訂購、以實際上推測、實在難以過好、因定洋麥而抛壓、無論本外埠、均不能負此重任也、結果本月份不動、十二份小一分、一月份不動、二月份小二分、三月份大一分、四月份不動云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　平水珠茶歐銷略動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、湖州平水緑茶、歐美行家、進意略形活動、其中頭二三號珠茶、交易尙稱旺盛、市價亦頗爲堅挺、屯溪珍眉針眉等緑茶、市况似較前見活、但茶價低落二三十兩茶商咸抱悲觀、且婺源高莊珍眉及貢熙緑茶、銷路仍趨呆滯、大勢並不見佳云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　長興煤供不敷求</h3>
<p>長興煤礦、自浙省府接辦以來、每日出煤現已增至三百餘噸、凡浙省之電廠及絲綢各工廠、多採用是煤、故銷路頗大、每日出貨不敷分配、大有供不應求之概、故滬上到貨極少、售價堅挺、兹將各貨最近售價長興塊十一兩五錢、長興統八兩七錢半、廣興塊十二兩五錢、廣興選九兩七錢半云、</p>
<h3>雜訊</h3>

<h3>開誠</h3>
<p>— 徐睡麟</p>
<p>一個女伶的復信</p>
<p>蔭君、</p>
<p>我眞想不到你竟然對我有了這樣的要求、也許怪我引誘了你罷、然而我對於朋友總是這樣、不、不是朋友、是熟人、對於熟人總是這樣、還不獨是對於熟人呢、對於一切的觀衆、總是這樣、本來别人對於我有這種行爲、並不奇怪、不要說一年、就是一個月、一個星期内面、總有好幾起、難得有一天早晨没有這一類討厭的函件、</p>
<p>你所恭維我的話、讚美我的話、早經别人用泛了、並且還有十倍或是百倍肉麻於你所說的、最初最初的時候、我確有點動心、現在早已司空見慣了、只會引起我的反感、有時候因爲文字用得好或是寫得好、到使得我認爲好玩、</p>
<p>濃裝艶抹、顧盼生情、這個已成了我日常生活上的必需、不如此不能吸引人的視線、不能吸引人的視線、則營業失敗、也就是我的聲名墜落、還有那個舞臺老板肯請我呢、我的生活及我一家的生活、將何以維持呢、這個已經是因習成性了、並且這内邊包有職業化商品化的作用、引誘人在普通社會是罪惡、在我們呢、是種藝術、是種職業、要優伶不引誘人、不如敎人不要吃飯、事實可能嗎、</p>
<p>在最初、這種引誘人的事、也很不慣、難爲情、以爲是罪惡、尤其是在舞臺已下、可是現在已經習慣了、覺得有許多男性跟着我追逐、很使我高興、常用許多非人情的方法、窘迫他們、蹂躪他們、他們還是很柔和的嬉笑的跟着我、</p>
<p>有的因爲受我一兩次捉弄、就死了心的、有的連三接四的受捉弄、還是跟着我、雖是有的人平素非常吝鄙、但是一上了我的鈎、就像換了個人、只要我横下心來、要他破産、他總是肯的、有些蠢的出了很大的代價、始終没有得到找一次的、有些聰明的、没有出什麽代價、就被他捉了機會去、最初却也曾便宜了幾個人、近幾年來、再也没有人買到我便宜了、最近這爭逐我的一羣人内面、能買到我便宜的、只有你、可是你又不是這一流的人、</p>
<p>我一動就要捉弄人、只是對於你、除極尋常的笑話以外、自問没有捉弄你過一次、因爲你又靈敏、又篤實、又聰明、又雅訓、所以我非常的恭敬你、確實超過了所謂熟人的情分、而到了朋友的交誼、這當然就是我陷害了你的原因、</p>
<p>我不忍心害你、不忍心使你更走到糊塗内面去、不是你這一切的眞情感動了我、你這封信、正是給我捉弄你的機會、我現在很恨、你爲什麽不在前幾年遇到我呢、那時我的習性還没壞到這樣程度呢、可是現在不行了、我精神方面、肉體方面、彷彿皆成了一個病的狀態、你還要我做什麽呢、固然我不會就這隨便的跟了你、不、假使你尋死賴活的一定要我、我一定可以跟你、不過將來成了個什麽結果、截絕預料不出、我前思後想、似乎是分開的好、明知你要感覺痛苦、我在時間上、也是要感覺很多的悽惘、然而還是分開的好、</p>
<p>你推測我一切的感想、如果在幾年前、却是恰到好處、雖是有的不合事實、却大部是對的、也許在一般少女也是對的、在現在、在我、則不然、客觀的推測、</p>
<p>要想盡合於當事者的感覺、我以爲事實上絕少可能、我現在不妨推心置腹的告訴你、我主觀上所感到的、你要爲我守着時間上的秘密、我相信爲人篤實、將來不至於拿這個來報復我、或要挾我、</p>
<p>像你這樣强壯的身體、是我所需要的、像你這樣靈敏的感覺、是我所願意的、像你這樣物質的環境、是我所不能滿足的、</p>
<p>我現在所追求的、是物質的享樂、換句話説、是汽車洋房、鋼琴、留聲機、無線電話、酒、肉、强烈的燈光、鮮明的彩色、</p>
<p>用銳響的聲音、人畜的使役、及一切可以錢買來而能激刺我的神經的供給、</p>
<p>高尙的理想、蒙不住我的意識、物質的火燄、烘得煖我的靈魂、這樣的個女人、你能供給我、我還是要演戲、如果仍舊演戲、則營業上需要的人、如劇評家、有權威的新聞記者、有錢有勢的長期顧客、少不得還是要往來、旣然照常往來、我的名義上雖然是有夫之婦、能夠嚇退他們徵逐我的野心嗎、我已浪漫成了習慣的人、能忽然板起面孔來對於一切的人、拒絕了友誼以上的要求嗎、我名義已經是你的夫人、行爲上不曾能改善、你能受得住這種侮辱嗎、</p>
<p>假如我現在所有的儲蓄、已經滿了我所預定的限度、說不得丢開我的營業、難得了這樣一個人要我、我就跟了你、也不怕你窮、然而我的儲蓄、只能夠我一兩年的生活、難不成敎我歇一兩年、再重行下海嗎、到那時、又要説與其今日、何必當初了、</p>
<p>我與你認識的關係、也是營業上、也是由顧客而認識而朋友的、認識以後、因爲你聰明的頭腦、對於服飾的配置、表情的深淺、音樂的調和、句調的編排、帮助我不少、換句話說、就是營業上帮助我的不少、冠冕其詞、就是藝術上帮助我不少、假如我跟了你之後、脫離了舞台生活、你在我面前大部分的優點將完全失落、决不能再像現在這樣的激動我、那時我對於你變不變心、我自己也没有把握、</p>
<p>我雖然不願意有你這樣一個丈夫、却願意有你這樣一個情人、你最初與我認識的時候、我以爲你是同他們抱着一樣目的來的、後來看看不是的、又以爲眞的愛好藝術、誰知你有了比他們更大的野心、想整個的攫得我、這眞是我想不到的、</p>
<p>你還記得我們有幾十次散戲分手的時候、敎你送我回去、好幾回到我的門口、假意不許你進門、還有好幾次到了我家内、不許進我的房門、不許坐到我床上、這許多無非想激起你進一步的要求、誰知你竟同小孩子一樣的聽吩咐、敎你什麽就什麽、我那時眞是又愛你、又敬你、但是又恨你、愛你的聰明、敬你的篤實、恨你的不解事、到現在我才曉得、你不是不解事、却是把這意思看深了一層、</p>
<p>現在我明白的向你表示、我不能做、</p>
<p>你的妻子、只能做你的情人、你如果肯做我的情人、我情願供給我所有的一切、使你快樂、你願意一月、一年、二年、你願意到什麽時候、就到什麽時候、就是我離開此地、無論到了那裏、只要有遇到的機會、你總可以有權利得到我、</p>
<p>情人與夫婦的分别、就是各人的行爲、互相的人格上不負責任、像你這樣誠篤的人、及一切生活的理想上、不宜有我這樣一個不規則的女人、像我這樣浪漫的人、爲營業上的關係、不應該有你這樣一個莊嚴的丈夫、如果是情人的話、我相信互相總是合得來的、</p>
<p>你或要說、「你自己旣然曉得行爲不規則、就這樣永久的不改正嗎、」</p>
<p>是的、在最近的期間内、還没有打算改正我的行爲、因爲我没有門閥的觀念、没有要顧到父兄名譽上的責任、且我輩的行爲、社會也值不得非難的、更談不到行爲上不規則將來嫁不到人、假使我要嫁的話、却有着若干的男子在聽我調選呢、我所以這樣的原因、固然由於營業的關係、自己也有點樂於如此、依我的推測、確有若干成年的婦女、羡慕着我們這種生活、只是因爲社會上種種的顧忌、壓抑住她們這種欲望、不得實現出來、縱使社會上妨礙衆多、監視嚴緊、在這種繁華的都市裏面、不獨下流社會、就是號稱爲上流社會的人家、有幾個女人是從一而終的、我眞不相信、不過重門深院、外人不得而知罷了、</p>
<p>這是我的短處、也就是要拒做你的名義上的夫人的原因、假使你願意跟我做情人、你可以長遠的不離我、就等於實際上的丈夫、到了你不願意的時候、隨時可以離開我、這樣是何等的自由、何等的合算、在經濟上名譽上、均與你無害、却與我有益的、</p>
<p>我現在二十五歲、這個營業至多再做十年、如果你要説、可以先跟我做十年情人、十年後我脫離了舞臺生活、再同你正式結婚、不、不要十年、只要滿足了我儲蓄的限度、隨時就脫離舞臺生活、如果你能屈就折節的做我的情人、我相信能再外努力、在最短最短的期間内、完成我的計劃、我名義上一成了你的夫人、隨即就改正我的行爲、並情願受你的約束與監視、</p>
<p>再不然、你等我十年、你今年不過二十三歲、三十三歲完婚也不算遲、這十年内、我並且補助你相當的用費、强如你跟我一同生活所用的、你也可以在隨便關係上得到性的滿足、</p>
<p>你或者要駡我無恥罷、我並不慚愧、我極忠實極誠懇的把我的心思告訴你、我自己曉得自己的弱點、現在像野馬一樣、再也受不住覊縛、如果我有意騙你、現在就照你來信的意思答應了你、等你入了我的彀中、到將來因爲生活的逼迫、也不愁你不跟我走、你雖是很靈敏、但是你缺少經騐、還相信你一時還看不出我的破綻、到那時也一定有種方法能使你深信不疑、即使等到你微有知聞、因爲你自己的名譽顔面、也只好暫時隠忍、也許還要進一步替我隠瞞、然而我不肯、不忍害了一個良善的靈魂、而且我自己的心計也用得太苦了、</p>
<p>再不然、你這一向、在我身邊、却化費了不少的精神、也應該有點代價、我情願還你一筆彀你在手内周旋的錢、你有許多生活的計劃、可以拿這個錢去開消、如果在最近的時間内有了很好的成績、到了我可以滿足的程度、我隨時走向你、同時你要注意、你如果允許我這個計劃、我今後也加倍努力、不過我的錢、你也許不願意要、認爲不潔凈的、</p>
<p>我現在矛盾、旣然不願意受你的約束、但又願意想以你做了我的歸宿、天下的女人、没有一個不希望她的男人是她所獨佔的、但是我現在却想在時間上佔有許多的男人、這又是一種矛盾、</p>
<p>像你這樣的男人、我相信平生除了你、不會再遇到、假使我失落了你、現在有着許多男人爭逐着我、雖感不到什麽難堪、到了我年老色衰的時候、就要感念到你了、愈到年老、就愈感念到你、你的眞誠篤實、確實感動了我、</p>
<p>照這麽說、爲什麽不就在這時候收了我的帆檣就跟了你呢、然而我又怎肯放棄了我現在却不尋常的地位呢、别人因爲我是哄動萬人的歌女、總以爲我一定有什麽神奇、我也就利用别人這種心理、就使出許多神奇、其實我平心而論、與天下的女人是一樣的平凡、我以爲歷史許多美人的奇跡、多半是時遷境異的傳會出來的、或是幾個或一個無聊的文人、爲滿足了他們理想上的色情狂、隨意鋪張出來的、</p>
<p>你所恭維我的許多話、我看了心内難過、别人這樣過情的恭維我、我利用他這種心理使他發狂、對於你、不肯這樣作弄、你過於視我爲神奇、不啻使你我之間、掘了一條不易合攏的鴻溝、上面告訴了你許多出於你的預料、並且你所不曉得的事、如果是出於第三者之口、你决不肯相信、並且還要認爲是惡意的侮辱、我現在親筆寫在紙上告訴你、你應該相信我確是同天下女人一樣平凡的女人、一點神奇都没有、並且缺少許多平常女人所應有的美德、（未完）</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>關於法比部分、我以爲聯軍總司令徵得法英美軍三總司令和比軍參謀總長同意後、應爲協約政府的諮議、</p>
<p>休戰條件第一第二兩項屬於軍事必要、第三項屬於賠欵保障、這些保障足以擔保法國和其聯盟國、尤其是比國、所要求的賠欵嗎、假使如此、賠欵償付之後、這些保障佔領區域將什麽樣、我軍是否繼續佔領、抑割據其一部、或建立獨立自治國以爲中立緩衝地、休戰是否把這些問題完全保留、這些問題聯軍總司令事前應與關係國政府詳細研究、休戰應使我軍獲得充分保障、以便和議時我所提出的條件可使敵方就範、</p>
<p>爲此原因、我應常與外交部重要人員有密切的接觸、外交部亦應常把其意見和協約政府的休戰條件向我通知、這樣、我才能决定軍事的保障同外交的保障不致顧此失彼、我對於法國以及協約國政府亦能盡其責任、</p>
<p>我因於信中詢問克萊孟沙君、彼如贊同此意、請即通知我與外交部何人接洽、</p>
<p>我認爲最關緊要的是預先詳細研究休戰的政治條件、以防將來變化、休戰有關大軍的停頓、休戰條文裏應包含和平條約的主要條件、將來變化如何、庶可不受意外打擊、</p>
<p>克萊孟沙總理意欲維持政府的自由行動、便在十月二十三日的覆信裏拒絶委派外交部重要官員同我接洽、</p>
<p>實則休戰條件須由協約政府决定、條文的擬訂自然也須歸協約政府辦理、</p>
<p>威爾遜總統已將此問題提交協約政府、他已通告德政府向協約國軍事顧問</p>
<p>談判、惟休戰條約之訂立與否、和條件詳情如何、均須完全由協約政府自行决定、</p>
<p>協約政府固無理由反對威爾遜總統、</p>
<p>的十四點的原則爲和平基礎、但如認爲必要、則可將幾點加修正、假使敵人完全接受休戰條件、協約政府亦不能反對停戰、（未完）</p>

<h3>敎官的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 朱鴻禧</p>
<p>敎官因爲初到學校、對於學校裏面的情形、還不十分清楚、心裏很有些不安</p>
<p>他用極誠懇的態度去問他的同鄕米司脫張、他問他以前學生對於軍事操有殁有興趣、學生是否能聽軍事敎官的命令按時上操、以及校長和敎職員對於軍事訓練所處的態度怎樣等等、結果那位米司脫張的答語、却很能使敎官滿意、</p>
<p>敎官想、這是一件很好的事、學生能服從軍事敎官的命令、上軍事操的時候能夠守紀律、</p>
<p>一陣無名的快活就頓時從内心裏發出来、</p>
<p>學校裏快要開課了、敎職員學生已漸漸地多起來、宿舍中、飯廳裏已時時有人進出、經騐告訴了他、學校已快要恢復暑假前的狀態了、敎官身上穿着一套灰色的中國斜紋軍裝、肩上背了一條斜角皮帶、頭上戴着一頂深灰色的軍帽、脚上打着一雙黑色的皮綁腿、雄糾糾的在學校四週散步、面上呈着一副誠懇莊嚴的臉色、</p>
<p>學校開始上課的那天、敎官因爲没有課、他乃靜靜地一個人坐在房裏看報、他偶爾想及過去的枯燥生活、就感到目前生活的滿足、最後他又不得不對自己的前途懷着一種希望、</p>
<p>但是敎官是一個受過良心訓練的人、他是極端反對背着軍人的招牌來升官發財的、</p>
<p>第二天下午、敎官依照學校排定的功課表開始上課了、在没有到上操以前、他先命校工將軍號吹了幾聲、自己即一面拿着點名簿、一面移動着脚步上操塲去、到了操塲、敎官迅速地舉着眼睛一看、却還看不見同學來上操、他乃再命校工將軍號吹了幾下、軍號響時、雙擊的上課鐘也響了、於是他才明白剛才學生還未曾上操塲是因爲還没有到上課時間的緣故、鐘聲停了後、敎官就看到前面有幾個穿短衣的學生向着操塲跑來、約過五分鐘光景、就有十多個人集全在操塲上、敎官打開點名簿、數一數名字、結果上操的人還不到五分之一、這很有些使敎官懷疑、心裏頓時生了一種不快之感、然而敎官一轉想、學校開學還不長久、没有上操的學生、也許是因爲忙於别的事情未及趕到、一種希望又從心坎裏湧上來、他坦然了、</p>
<p>敎官是一個主張良心救國的人、對於那些養着、嬌妻美妾而不能盡職的軍人、他是極端攻擊的、有一次他曾公開的對許多學生面前發過議論、說國家裏面最可痛恨的人、是那些祗會吃飯而不會做事的人、尤其是那些吃公家的飯而不爲公家做事的人更爲可恨、最後他又說、</p>
<p>他此次奉了中央的命令到本校來當軍事敎官、他對於本校的軍事訓練須有十分成績才能對得住中央、對得住自己、否則他是極不情願的、與其吃這種有名無實的飯、就不如不吃、……當時的同學没有一個不爲敎官的話所感動、</p>
<p>星期六的下午、敎官又拿了點名簿上操去了、不、是上學科、在第二次軍號停了之後、敎官就跑進了第九敎室、走進敎室、敎官心裏又覺得有些懷疑、爲什麽一百多個人又是到了這樣寥寥的幾個呢、敎官茫然了、但是敎官一想、今天是星期六、在星期六的下午、有許多學校是不上課的、學校裏把這點鐘課排在星期六下午實在有些不妥、今天他們都不來上課、不是没有原因的、</p>
<p>光陰一天天的過去、敎官對於學校的情形也一天天的明白了、兩個星期過了之後、他得了事實的敎訓、他的勇氣、他的希望、已漸漸地消失了、他已開始把自己放進悲哀、失望、消極裏面去了、</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>自開學到現在、差不多已有兩個多月、敎官的計劃仍舊没有實行、敎官的希望依然没有達到、敎官還是和從前一樣的悲哀、失望、</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Concentrates Its Full Strength to Bomb Our Positions Fiercely; Ma Zhanshan's Troops Fight Bloodily</h3>
<p>The enemy used tanks to charge and break through our army's defense line</p>
<p>Planes and heavy artillery covered the advance of a large force towards the right wing.</p>
<p>Our army resisted with hand-to-hand combat, repelling the fierce enemy with a smaller force.</p>
<p>Fierce fighting continues in the front at Daxing and Sanjianfang.</p>
<p>The League of Nations discusses and affirms the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<h3>Tragic and Ardent Decisive Battle on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Line</h3>
<p>The Japanese army launched a general offensive the night before last.</p>
<p>Breaking through our right-wing defense line</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan supervised the team to counterattack.</p>
<p>Finally, all the enemies were repelled.</p>
<p>A Japanese detachment attacked Hei'an.</p>
<p>Our army is currently resisting.</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the evening of the 17th, the 14th and 15th Regiments of the Japanese Korean Mixed Brigade arrived in Tailai. The enemy's forces increased, and they launched a large-scale attack at 11:00 p.m. Four tanks covered a team with handheld machine guns, fiercely attacking the right-wing defense line of Tangchi Mushroom. The cavalry of Wu Lucheng's Brigade, consisting of two regiments, defended the area to the death. The Japanese army's heavy artillery bombardment with flares was particularly fierce. At the same time, the front defense line between Sanjianfang and Daxing was surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Japanese Amano Brigade, preventing any reinforcements. By 2:00 a.m. on the 18th, the battle intensified. The Japanese Domon Division also led 2,000 men to reinforce. The fierce fighting led to hand-to-hand combat. Our army's trenches were all destroyed by the enemy's tanks. The soldiers went out of the trenches to fight, suffering more than two battalions' worth of casualties. The soldiers resisted bloodily, holding out until dawn. Seven Japanese planes came and dropped fierce bombs. Our army ran out of ammunition and retreated from the right wing at around 7:00 a.m., fighting as they retreated to Ang'angxi, east of the East Railway tracks. The Japanese army continued to pursue with planes covering a large force. The bombs dropped all landed on the East Railway station and the tracks, causing severe damage. At 1:00 p.m. this afternoon, Ma Zhanshan, hearing of the emergency at the front, personally led his guard from the provincial capital to Ang'angxi to encourage the soldiers. He personally led the counterattack against the Japanese army. With Ma's leadership, the soldiers bravely charged, each fighting on their own, and the enemy was routed. At 1:50 p.m., we repelled them. Three hours later, our right-wing troops returned to their original defense line to hold firm. Currently, fierce fighting continues in the front at Daxing and Sanjianfang. At 3:00 p.m. this afternoon, a Japanese detachment of 500 men secretly bypassed and attacked Hei'an from the direction of the Ang'angxi Bridge on the East Railway. The Longjiang Security Team has been ordered to intercept them outside the province and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xinmin Telegram: The Japanese army is deeply concerned that Chinese troops will attack their flanks in the Nenjiang battle, so they have been reinforcing troops along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Road for days to bolster their strength. It is reported that preparations were completed on the 17th. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side deliberately spread propaganda, saying that Ma Zhanshan sent an ultimatum to Honjo on the 17th, ordering the Japanese army to withdraw from Nenjiang immediately. In fact, Honjo intends to issue a general offensive order within a day or two, fearing that there is no excuse, so he created this rumor to deceive the world.</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese 8th Mixed Brigade is passing through the border one after another, heading to Nenjiang. In the Sipingjie and Gongzhuling areas, they are requisitioning civilian vehicles and horses along the way to transport supplies. Villagers who do not have vehicles and horses are often killed. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui Telegram: Yesterday, there was a small contact between our army and Ma Zhanshan's troops. Yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m., two Japanese planes flew to Daxiao Xintun and Sanjianfang to reconnoiter our army's positions and dropped bombs. At 1:00 p.m., seven Japanese planes flew to the provincial capital for reconnaissance. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui Telegram: On the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army used heavy artillery to cover their cavalry in a general offensive on our entire cavalry line, which was very fierce. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military strength attacking General Ma Zhanshan has not been announced by the authorities. However, it was learned from a certain high-ranking official tonight that within the next day or two, reinforcements will be sent from Changchun to Nenjiang. The Japanese main army in Manchuria must now be stationed between Shenyang and Xinmintun to prevent the possibility of an attack from the Zhou area. Therefore, the Japanese army attacking Ma Zhanshan is probably less than one-fourth of the total Japanese army.

<p>(Shenyang) According to a Japanese public statement, the Japanese army's offensive against Ma Zhanshan has already begun this morning. Ma is stationed with heavy troops south of Ang'angxi. The public statement then detailed Ma Zhanshan's rise and the harm the Japanese army has suffered from him. It continued that recently, the two sides have been in daily contact, and yesterday the Chinese army actually took a siege offensive. The Nenjiang Japanese army, in order to eliminate the harm and for self-defense, decided to take an offensive against Ma's army this morning. The Japanese military headquarters in Shenyang had not yet received any news about the progress of the battle at noon today. The Japanese army has infantry, cavalry, artillery, and aircraft, but Ma's army has far more people than the Japanese army, and except for aircraft, their military equipment is also good. The people of Shenyang all believe that the outcome of the two sides will be decided in this battle. Either Ma Zhanshan will be defeated and flee, or the Japanese army will be driven out of the Nenjiang area. If the Japanese army is defeated, it will not be able to apply the same old trick to the Heilongjiang province as it did to other parts of the three northeastern provinces. Today's public statement issued by the Japanese authorities is ambiguous and accuses Ma Zhanshan of not complying with the Japanese demands in a timely manner. In fact, the Japanese demands were made on November 14, with a deadline for reply within 24 hours, but Ma's reply was delayed in transmission and only reached the Japanese military committee in Harbin on the 17th. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Seeing that the war in Heilongjiang Province was intensifying, Japanese Chief of Staff Kanaya hurriedly returned to Tokyo from Kyushu yesterday and immediately met with Minister of the Army Minami and Vice Chief of Staff Ninomiya to discuss that since General Ma Zhanshan had rejected Japan's request for troop withdrawal and resignation, the Japanese army on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway had no choice but to advance. According to reliable sources, in addition to the air force and mixed brigade that were sent to the three northeastern provinces yesterday, a division would be sent from Japan to Kwantung for reinforcements, but which division to send has not yet been specified. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The weather in northern Manchuria today is sunny, cold, and with strong northerly winds, causing great distress to the Japanese soldiers. At 3:00 a.m. this morning, the iron bridge in Sanlin was destroyed by Ma Zhanshan's detachment, and the Japanese reinforcements could not arrive in time, causing great concern to the Japanese army. (Japanese United Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese military authorities here discussed the possibility of causing a Russo-Japanese dispute. It is said that the Japanese army does not want to infringe upon the rights of the Russians on the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, if the war continues north of the Nenjiang River, the Japanese army may inevitably cross the Chinese Eastern Railway line. Yesterday, a team of Chinese cavalry cut off the Japanese army's rear, cutting off the railway and telephone communication 40 kilometers north of Zhengjiatun, cutting the telephone lines and burning the poles. The Japanese military authorities suddenly prevented news reporters from going to the front line via the Taonan Railway, which proves that the war situation on the Nenjiang side is very serious. It is widely believed that the Japanese are now sending reinforcements to the Nenjiang River, as a team of soldiers stationed near Juluhe hastily set out today, and the destination is unknown.</p>
<p>(Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) After dawn this morning, the Japanese army on the Nenjiang River launched a large-scale offensive against Ma Zhanshan's army. The artillery bombarded Ma's army's positions fiercely, and the results are still unknown. The Japanese army has more than 4,000 troops, with field artillery and air force, which are their advantages. However, the Chinese army has more cavalry and is accustomed to the cold, which are the Chinese army's advantages. It is widely rumored here that Japanese officers are currently training hundreds of Koreans at Beidaying. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Haipeng Professes Allegiance to Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Shenyang: The Japanese army's position in the Nenjiang area has been plunged into a predicament due to Zhang Haipeng's defection to the righteous cause. Zhang Haipeng initially relied on the Japanese and even launched an attack on Heilongjiang Province. Today, he has broken away from the Japanese and professed allegiance to Ma Zhanshan. From now on, he will cut off the Japanese army's communication line with the Kwantung Headquarters in Shenyang. The position of the Japanese army in Taonan is also in danger. Honjo, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, has telegraphed Shenyang, urgently calling for reinforcements to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Haipeng, under the instigation of the Japanese, established a Mongolian border bank in Tailai. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Vehicle Falls into the River, Suffering Huge Losses</h3>
<p>(Harbin) This morning at 8:00 a.m., it was confirmed that the Japanese army that fell into the river at Jiangqiao consisted of 1,700 infantry and artillery soldiers, 400 horses, 51 train cars, and 12 cannons, along with ammunition, worth 20 million Japanese yen. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Before the Japanese armored train fell into the river at Jiangqiao this morning, it first sent planes to scout and saw that our army was not moving, intending to drive safely across Daxing to attack. Unexpectedly, the Jiangqiao bridge was repaired with wood and could not withstand the weight, so it broke in the middle, and the train fell into the river and was mostly shattered. The soldiers and horses were all destroyed. It is said that the army belonged to the Hasegawa Unit 7974th Regiment. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Stimson's Statement Denies Reports of Private Communication with the Japanese Ambassador, Saying That He Will Consider Future Disciplinary Issues Separately</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson today denied newspaper reports that the US government had privately informed the Japanese ambassador that if the League of Nations decided to impose economic sanctions on Japan or recall its ambassador to Japan, the United States would not want to participate. However, he said that the United States would consider future disciplinary issues on its own. From this statement, it can be seen that Dawes's absence from the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting in Paris is actually because the United States has not yet decided how to follow the League of Nations in sanctioning Japan. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Administrative Council Continued Its Secret Meeting Yesterday; the Situation Became Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>Focus on Discussing the Scope of Sino-Japanese Treaties</p>
<p>The United States Insists on the Open Door Policy</p>
<p>The Japanese Representative Presents Concrete New Measures</p>
<p>Briand Claims Illness and Asks Simon to Substitute</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's Council secret meeting adjourned at 1:07 p.m. The majority of what the council members discussed were purely theoretical issues, and there was very little progress on actual solutions. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During the secret meeting of the League of Nations Council this morning, the discussions of the various council members focused on reconciling the views of the three countries, Britain, France, and the United States, regarding Sino-Japanese treaties and their relationship with the Three Northeastern Provinces Incident, and affirming the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty was the main issue discussed. Although US Secretary of State Stimson had stated in his conversations that the United States had considered the issue of applying sanctions, the Council has not yet discussed anything beyond treaties. When the twelve council members held a secret meeting at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, Chairman Briand and the Chinese and Japanese representatives did not participate. It is said that the issue of whether or not to accept the Open Door Policy advocated by Hay and Roosevelt is of utmost importance in today's secret meeting. It is claimed that although the Council's goal is to resolve the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, the strategy being used at this time is to prevent the Chinese and Japanese representatives from making an all-encompassing declaration in the Council before reaching a consensus on a solution. Because what the Council is most concerned about at this time is reaching a consensus, and it will not allow the existence of special interests in China. The Japanese representative Yoshizawa is about to make a lengthy public declaration, demanding recognition of Japan's special interests, concessions, and investments in the eastern provinces. Therefore, the secret meeting of the twelve council members is intended to prevent the publication of such a declaration. At this time, the US representative Dawes is busy solemnly declaring to the various council members, especially the Chinese and Japanese representatives, that the United States cannot abandon its traditional policy of opposing special interests in China. Although Mr. Dawes did not actually participate in the formal discussions of the Council, he is taking a certain position regarding the Council, expressing that the United States believes that it is impossible for Americans to even consider violating its policy towards China since 1899. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the council members held more secret diplomatic talks. Briand suddenly became slightly ill last night due to the heat in the room. He still came out to mediate today, but he was obviously not fully recovered. Although he had a long conversation with Dawes in the morning, it is expected that he will have to rest for at least a few days, entrusting Simon to handle most of the daily official duties of the chairman. The French political circles are trying their best to deny that Briand's illness is political in nature, due to disappointment at not being able to save the League of Nations from a dangerous situation, claiming that Briand is really sick, and the League of Nations is not in a dangerous situation. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Executive Council held a secret meeting this morning, which did not end until 1:00 p.m. Simon, Chalais, Zelensky, Le Roux, and Pouillot all declared that their respective governments would fully support the Executive Council and increase the credibility of the League of Nations. The Executive Council will hold another non-public meeting at 4:00 p.m. to listen to the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese representatives separately. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that the Japanese government must first recognize its five basic principles before it can agree to the League of Nations presiding over the dispatch of a mixed committee to Manchuria to investigate and report to the Administrative Council. This is the basis of the Japanese compromise. The situation is serious and gradually reaches its peak. The secret meeting this morning lasted two hours. After the meeting adjourned, no public statement was issued. Chairman Briand strongly advocated the necessity of maintaining the League of Nations charter. The British representative Simon and the Russian representative Dovgalevsky supported his words, which greatly excited the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Administrative Council decided to hold another secret meeting this afternoon and invited the Chinese and Japanese representatives to attend separately to express their opinions. When the Council reconvened this morning, Briand reported on his conversation with the Japanese representative. It is heard that the Japanese representative has already proposed concrete measures, based on the five Japanese principles, which may be the basis for an understanding. Shi Zhaoji is about to be presented with these measures, so Shi's attitude towards this is extremely important. US Secretary of State Stimson's statement that the United States is prepared to support any plan adopted by the League of Nations has made a very powerful impression. It is widely believed that this statement can strengthen China's attitude. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to hold another non-public meeting at 11:00 a.m. this morning, which will not be recorded and no unauthorized persons will be allowed to enter the room. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese representatives have been invited to attend. If the Japanese representative's reply is received by then, Briand will read it out. The last meeting in Geneva was delayed due to delays in communication between the Japanese representative and Tokyo. This time, with Matsudaira's help, things can proceed quickly. It is heard that Matsudaira has already sought the information requested by the Administrative Council from Tokyo before receiving a formal request from the Administrative Council. Matsudaira is in contact with Simon behind the scenes from time to time, but progress is minimal. Le Petit Parisien reported that Yoshizawa has already supplied Briand with the details of the treaties, that is, those that grant Japan rights in Manchuria. Le Petit Parisien also</p>

<h3>Can We Sit idly by and Watch Ma Zhanshan's Isolated Army Resist Tyranny?</h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan is defending our territory and resisting tyranny with an isolated army. He vowed to fight to the death, saying to the people, "My subordinates and I are determined to fight to the end. Even if the soldiers are all gone in the future, we will still lead the militia to fight the Japanese to the end." These words of unwavering loyalty, tragic and passionate, are as if we can hear his voice and see his person. This man standing tall in the cold borderlands and competing with a powerful enemy is truly the embodiment of the spirit of our nation.</p>
<p>Recently, British and American reporters visited the General and inspected Ma's positions, saying, "Ma Zhanshan and Wu Songshan are brave and invincible. The soldiers are full of morale and united like iron. They are already the most capable army in the world." They also said, "The Japanese army is increasing in number, and the Heilongjiang army has no reinforcements. It is most worrying that Japan will use the neutral attitude of various provinces of China to concentrate its full strength to attack Heilongjiang." Finally, they expressed their deep sigh, saying, "The Chinese government and millions of soldiers in Beiping sit idly by and watch a province resist a country without providing assistance. In the eyes of us Europeans and Americans, this is extremely shocking." Alas, what words are these? Can our government and our people still not feel ashamed, moved, and rise up upon hearing these words?</p>
<p>Ma is fighting with an isolated army, isolated in the wilderness. Without orders to resist, he could have chosen not to risk his life and confront the wolves. Moreover, while he and his men were fighting fiercely in life-and-death struggles with a powerful enemy, Wan Fulin's son, Wan Guobin, absconded with 11 million yuan of Heilongjiang's treasury funds. The treasury was empty, and food was scarce. The entire army was without food for two days. Under these circumstances, Ma could have retreated and abandoned his soldiers. The Japanese army is continuously deploying more troops, and its planes and artillery will be greatly increased. It is difficult for an isolated army without reinforcements to resist in the end. Ma is not unaware that there is no chance of success. However, the more difficult the environment, the more passionate the morale. With one call to arms, the wounded and scarred rise up to defend the country and protect the territory, never turning back. The country has such a good general, and the people have such good soldiers. It is truly enough to invigorate our decline and frighten the enemy. According to news on the 17th, the Japanese army has transported all of the newly deployed 8th Mixed Brigade to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line, preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Heilongjiang. However, our country's millions of troops are still sitting idly by and watching the isolated army fight, and even in this time of emergency and crisis, there has been no active assistance. Do they consider Heilongjiang Province not to be Chinese territory? If not, then our government must actively provide Ma's troops with real assistance and food supplies. At this time, there must be no delay.</p>
<p>We still remember the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Foreign commentators said that Japan was not fighting against China, but only against Zhili Province; not against Zhili Province, but against the Beijing government; not against the Beijing government, but only against Li Hongzhang. This cold commentary vividly depicts the disintegration of our national spirit. More than twenty years have passed since 1894-95. Time has passed, but the situation is still the same as yesterday. The lack of unity and progress among the Chinese people is still the same as yesterday. More than twenty years later, today, we hear European and American reporters say, "The Chinese government and millions of soldiers in Beiping sit idly by and watch a province resist a country without providing assistance." This is truly the supreme shame of our nation. Who should bear this responsibility? Our people dare to ask loudly.</p>
<p>In recent days, the people have been donating money to support Ma's army's supplies, and they are becoming increasingly enthusiastic. A weak woman in Guangdong mortgaged her electricity stocks for 25,000 yuan and remitted it all to Heilongjiang, destroying her family to save the country. Students from the Southeast Pharmaceutical College in this city are also organizing a medical team to go to Heilongjiang to assist Ma's army. All of these things prove that the people have never sat idly by and watched General Ma's isolated army fight without providing support. The people's morale is now available. If the government does not actively rise up, when will it wait?</p>
<p>According to news on the 17th, the League of Nations secret meeting is still planning to order China and Japan to negotiate directly. The League of Nations' attitude is now becoming increasingly clear. Will we still not make final preparations and bow our heads and wait to be slaughtered? We now dare to suggest three points to our government.</p>
<p>First, use force to recover the lost territory.</p>
<p>Second, fully provide the Heilongjiang army with real assistance.</p>
<p>Third, order Wan Guobin to return the provincial treasury funds he absconded with.</p>
<p>This is already the last chance. All the people deeply hope that our government can make a decisive decision.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>It is said that the Administrative Council asked Yoshizawa to distinguish between treaties that are purely related to the safety of the lives and property of Japanese people, which Japan can reasonably demand that China recognize before Japanese troops withdraw, and treaties that are related to economic rights. Yoshizawa's distinction is quite inaccurate. It is heard that he has asked the government for instructions and will not reply for the time being. L'Echo de Paris reported that when Yoshizawa and Matsudaira met with Briand and Simon, their answers to the questions raised by the British and French representatives were not substantive. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) There has been much discussion today, but the demands of China and Japan regarding the Manchuria issue are still far apart. Japan's attitude seems unchanged, or even slightly tougher than before. Therefore, it is widely believed that it will take a long time to resolve this matter. The Administrative Council's greatest difficulty is related to the extent and scope of Japan's treaty rights. It is likely that a strong committee will be organized with important figures such as Simon to consider this point. According to Le Journal, the solution that the Administrative Council is currently leaning towards is to create a good atmosphere to facilitate direct negotiations between China and Japan, with the understanding that the League of Nations will closely monitor their progress after these negotiations begin. It is widely hoped that this approach can deal with China's opposition to direct negotiations. Le Temps reported that the work of the League of Nations Administrative Council is only to safeguard peace, as stipulated in Article 11 of the Charter. The way to safeguard peace is to adopt moderate and flexible methods to promote a peaceful solution through direct negotiations between the two parties. Today's discussion focused on a comparison of the positions of China and Japan. Simon spoke a lot, but in the end, the Administrative Council decided that there was not enough information available to make a judgment on the treaties that Japan demanded recognition of. Several members believe that some of the Sino-Japanese treaties are purely economic in nature, and rather than being a question of validity, they are a question of interpretation. Therefore, a major step could be made by identifying the real points of contention. Members of the Administrative Council may not agree to repudiate treaties signed by de facto governments, especially the 1915 treaty that China claims was signed under duress. However, the secret clauses of the 1905 treaty regarding railway construction rights and the 1898 treaty regarding the transfer of Russian rights in Manchuria should be submitted to arbitration. These treaties do not involve the safety of Japanese people. The above</p>

<h3>Domestic Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>According to the intentions of certain members, behind-the-scenes activities are quite prevalent. Members of the Administrative Council and the Chinese and Japanese representatives have met several times. The most important meetings were between Matsudaira and Simon, and Shi Zhaoji and Dawes. The outcome is quite speculative. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The opinion of the Chinese community in Paris is that the current situation in Manchuria urgently needs a practical solution. Theoretical issues, such as treaties, can be left for final discussion after bloodshed has ceased. If the Japanese do not trust the Chinese to protect their people, the Chinese would not object to a committee of neutral countries monitoring the implementation of Chinese promises. According to the Chinese view, treaty issues are very complex and require time to handle. They should not be discussed simultaneously with the Japanese troop withdrawal. The Chinese will, of course, recognize all valid international treaties that can be faithfully implemented without hindering the clauses of other treaties signed by China. China abides by the Washington Treaty of 1922, which was also signed by the Japanese and stipulates China's Open Door Policy. However, the provisions of the Open Door Policy greatly conflict with certain requirements of the 1915 treaty, which China considers to have been signed under duress. This is the crux of the situation. China is prepared to submit this legal difficulty to arbitration in any appropriate form, but is determined not to prepare for separate discussions with Japan on the interpretation of previous treaties or the clauses of future treaties while Japanese troops still occupy Chinese territory. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At this moment, the activities of Dawes are attracting attention in Paris, especially the repeated consultations between Dawes and Matsudaira. According to those involved in political affairs, the US position can be explained in a few words. US policy attaches the greatest importance to the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington and the Open Door system in Manchuria. Under no circumstances will any changes be allowed. Stinson will especially not acknowledge Japan using force to occupy and alter the appearance of the aforementioned treaty, as it will inevitably diminish the position of the powers in Manchuria. In this regard, Dawes will certainly focus on the political substance and practical results, and will not hesitate to make concessions in form to preserve Japan's dignity. He is willing to allow Japan to achieve satisfactory results regarding the date of troop withdrawal. Dawes seemed to have mentioned this during his talks with Matsudaira, or perhaps he has already obtained agreement. The urgent task now is to provide formal satisfaction to Tokyo and Nanjing and obtain their approval. Such is the result of the consultations here. It is hoped that the Chinese and Japanese governments will not let concerns about their prestige hinder progress; otherwise, the results of the consultations will be like morning dew, benefiting no one, and the damage to the cause of peace in politics will be far from trivial.

<h3>League of Nations Secretariat Releases Sino-Japanese Documents: Japan Shamelessly Insists on Salt Revenue</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, the League of Nations released important documents submitted by China and Japan. One is Japan's reply denying the forceful seizure of Chinese salt revenue. It states that China violated previous agreements and completely overturned the salt tax system established by the 1913 Reorganization Loan. The purpose of the Japanese authorities is to prevent the release of salt revenue for use by hostile elements. For this reason, the salt revenue was submitted to the Shenyang Defense and Order Maintenance Committee. The Japanese military authorities did not use pressure on salt officials, nor did they intercept the transfer of salt revenue to the central government, nor did they hinder the payment of office expenses. The Japanese have never used this money for their own purposes. At the request of the Japanese representative, the League of Nations Secretariat also released today a letter from Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara on November 15 to the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, responding to China's protest against the Japanese advance into Nenjiang. It stated that the conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops was due to the disloyal actions of the Chinese troops, and the entire responsibility should be borne by the Chinese troops. However, the Chinese representative's letter released today stated that the battles on November 13 and 14 were initiated by the Japanese army. The Chinese soldiers retreated backward. The Japanese Commander Honjo intended to cross the Chinese Eastern Railway line and occupy Qiqihar. This intention has been proven by the announcement of the Japanese Consul and the Japanese military representative, Major Hayashi, and by the anxiety of Soviet Russia. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, Chinese Chief Representative Shi sent a letter to the Council, requesting attention to the number of Chinese military casualties following the Japanese military attacks in Daxing and other places, which shows the intensity of the fighting. He also formally denied the rumors that China was contacting Soviet Russia to purchase military supplies. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>British and American Defense Troops Withdraw Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Wang Shuchang Receives the Press</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Public Security Bureau began dismantling the defenses within 300 meters at 8:00 AM on the 18th, completing it by 2:00 PM. The police immediately resumed their positions. The Japanese side, distrusting this, also sent Staff Officer Yamaura with four military policemen to inspect with our representative, Dong Zhifang. The defenses of the Japanese Concession facing the Chinese and French Concessions remain unchanged. Japanese soldiers are lying behind sandbags, ready to fire, and the heavy guard has not lessened. Only the electric fence at the south entrance of Asahi Street has been opened. Those with a pass from the Japanese police station are allowed to enter and exit after being searched by Japanese soldiers. After 8:00 PM, the electric fence is blocked again. Shops in the Japanese Concession remain closed. Shops in the Chinese streets open for business from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The defenses south of Dongma Road and east of Nanma Road, south of Nanguan Xiatou, and east of Ningjia Bridge have not been removed, and traffic is still blocked. Trams only run from Dongfu Bridge and Laolongtou to the French Concession. Trams to the city center and the Japanese Concession are not running.

British and American defense troops withdrew at noon on the 18th, and sent a small number of soldiers to patrol at night. The French Municipal Council captured Ma Longzhang, reportedly the commander of the plainclothes team, in Tongshan Lane on the afternoon of the 17th, but there was no evidence. He was handed over to the Public Security Bureau at noon on the 18th. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Take Complete Control in All Regions of Jilin Province</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to refugees who escaped from Jilin Province: (1) After the Jichang and Jitun railways were forcibly merged by the violent Japanese, they became virtually state-owned railways of Japan. The Japanese completely control personnel and administration, and have implemented track connection on the Jitun Railway, directly connecting it to the Japanese mainland. (2) Vendors on all railways are not allowed to sell Chinese goods, read Chinese newspapers, or possess books with patriotic content. (3) Each policeman is only issued four bullets, and they are checked every three days. They are punished if even one bullet is missing. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

According to what he told an American reporter at the station, he will return to Shenyang in four or five days. However, Japanese propaganda says that Pu Wei is going to Dalian to welcome Puyi to Shenyang to take his position. Also, Pu Wei's attitude towards visitors has suddenly become negative, denying the restoration of Puyi and the claim that he was appointed as a Grand Councilor. He also said that Zheng Xiaoxu, Jin Liang and others are responsible for Puyi's actions, and he did not participate.</p>

<h3>Japan's National Treasury Depleted; Plans to Increase Taxes and Borrow to Cover Military Expenses</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Manchurian Incident, the army has dispatched troops to various parts of Manchuria, and the navy has dispatched warships to various ports in China. As a result, the army and navy departments' so-called "China Incident expenses" are huge. The Ministry of Finance considered the source of funds and found that current fiscal revenues are exhausted and there is no way to obtain this huge amount. It has therefore decided to issue public bonds and plans to submit a bond issuance method to the next session of the Diet. (Nippon Dempo dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's fiscal revenue for the next year is short by 130 million yen. The Ministry of Finance has decided to fill the gap by increasing taxes by 50 million yen and issuing various public bonds for 80 million yen. (Nippon Dempo dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Ministry Dispatches Staff Officer to Eastern Provinces with Important Mission</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Second Staff Officer of the Army, Ninomiya, left Tokyo for Manchuria last night at 9:45 PM on an important mission from the Army Central Department. Ninomiya said in the car, "I am going to Manchuria for three purposes: to connect the various tasks between the Army Central Department and the troops stationed in Manchuria, to comfort the troops, and to inspect the situation in Manchuria. The Japanese attitude towards Ma Zhanshan has been stated by the government. If Ma Zhanshan does not recognize Japan's five demands by the 25th of this month, the Japanese army will of course take decisive measures in accordance with the statement and exert its power. Since I am going to Manchuria, I will see what the result will be. Therefore, the duration of my stay in Manchuria cannot be determined, but I plan to inspect Shenyang, Nenjiang, Harbin, and Jilin within about three weeks." (Nippon Dempo dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Chief of Staff of the Army, Kanaya, returned to Tokyo from the army training ground at 10:00 PM last night and immediately met with Second Staff Officer Ninomiya to inquire about the battle situation in Nenjiang.

They dispersed after two hours. (Nippon Dempo dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Glimpse of French Press Commentary</h3>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers are striving for a path of mediation. The left-wing is closer to China, while the moderates do not want to offend Japan's national idea. *Le Temps* best represents the views of the moderates. Its editorial says: "One thing has been confirmed: no one wants the Administrative Council to confront Japan. If Japan resolutely opposes, the result may be its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The general feeling is that China has allowed the situation to become complicated because it has extravagant hopes for the League of Nations. China believes that the League of Nations can exert pressure on Japan, making it feel the threat of special measures and voluntarily concede, which would be beneficial to resolving the dispute. China's thinking is encouraged by some, and those people should bear most of the responsibility for the current difficulties. In fact, the actions of the Administrative Council can never have this tendency. Its task is to resolve disputes, and to do so with agility and prudence, in order to maintain world peace. The Sino-Japanese dispute is only of a local nature, and the power of the powers should prevent this dispute from developing into an open war and facilitate direct negotiations between the parties concerned, so that it can be resolved peacefully."

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Sends Telegram to Chiang to Express Gratitude and Sympathy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Zhanshan replied to Chiang's telegram on the 17th: "The Japanese rely on violence and disregard justice. Zhanshan, upholding the authority of the party and the nation, shoulders the defense of our territory, strives to fulfill his duties, and comforts the concerns of the nation. I am sincerely grateful for your warm words, which greatly increase my anxiety and trepidation. I have conveyed your intentions to the generals, and the morale of the soldiers is high. I hereby send this telegram to express my gratitude." (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Heilongjiang Chairman Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Zhang Zhijiang and the Asian Cultural Association, the Anti-Japanese Association of the Capital's industrial circles, and Chen Panling, the representative of Henan Province attending the Fourth Plenary Session, on the 16th: "Having read your telegrams, I am deeply grateful for your praise and encouragement, but feel even more apprehensive. The nation is in dire straits, and the military bears heavy responsibilities. We should still supervise our soldiers and strive to defend ourselves. Even with one soldier or one squad left, we must continue to fight. I hope you will awaken the public to resist aggression together. With support from the rear, the vanguard will be sharp, and the annihilation of the enemy will be within easy reach." (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Various Parties Contribute to Reward Ma Zhanshan's Troops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session passed measures to reward Ma Zhanshan and the Heilongjiang army. All the representatives of the conference will donate part or all of their attendance fees to reward the army, which will be remitted to Heilongjiang Province by the conference. The Secretariat of the Conference notified all the representatives on the 18th, requesting that the donated funds be sent to the accounting section of the conference. Those who have not yet received or have only received a portion of their attendance fees can inform the office of the amount donated so that it can be deducted and remitted to Heilongjiang Province. It is reported that the representatives are enthusiastically donating to the accounting section, and there are also quite a few who have donated all their attendance fees and travel expenses, and those who have voluntarily donated large sums. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The staff of the Construction Committee believes that Ma Zhanshan's army is fighting hard alone against the violent Japanese, which is rare among the military today. Without external support and lacking food and supplies, what Chinese can bear to sit idly by? They have initiated a public service personnel "Save Heilongjiang" free donation, starting with the committee. They immediately raised more than a thousand yuan, which will be directly telegraphed to Heilongjiang in the coming days. Other institutions are also continuing to raise funds.

<p>(Changsha) The Hunan Provincial Steering Committee telegraphed Acting Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province on the 16th, stating: "The Japanese are rampant, violent, and brutal, seizing and occupying Liaoning and Jilin. Their atrocities continue, invading Longjiang. You, Mr. Chairman, with your fearless spirit, make a just defense, and with loyalty, courage, and vigor, protect our land. The Heilong River remains, and the Longsha region is safe. The northeast region relies on you to act as a Great Wall. We admire you from afar. The meeting represents the 30 million people of Hunan Province and sends its respects from afar. We hope that you will continue your efforts, relieve the national crisis as soon as possible, restore our rivers and mountains, and consolidate our territory. We also hope that the Changsha municipal and county party departments sent telegrams of condolence on the same day." (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong's overseas representative to the Fourth Plenary Session, Chen Jieyu, and others, representing all overseas Chinese, telegraphed Ma Zhanshan on the 16th to express their condolences.

<h3>Nanjing Schools' Anti-Japanese Association Conducts Armed Petition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of various schools in the capital, totaling about 10,000 people, all dressed in volunteer army uniforms or Red Cross uniforms, gathered at the large parade ground of Zhongnan Middle School at 9:00 AM on the 18th. At 10:00 AM, they lined up to go to the Fourth Plenary Session to hold a general petition. They entered in single file and stood respectfully in front of the Science Hall of National Central University. The general commander, chief inspector, and representatives of each school of the petition presented a petition to the Fourth Plenary Session, reading out the main points of the petition: 1. Realize a unified government; 2. Take back the lost territories in Northeast China by force; 3. Provide substantial assistance to Ma Zhanshan; 4. Request the League of Nations to implement the Covenant; 5. Implement democratic politics; 6. Stop Puyi's restoration; 7. Select the central executive and supervisory committee members carefully; 8. Support the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement; 9. Please issue rifles to the volunteer army; 10. Please expand the navy and air force; 11. Replenish foreign envoys. The conference then appointed Cai Yuanpei, Enhe Batu, Huang Musong, and Dai Kuisheng, four members of the presidium, to respond to the petition group. Cai responded to each of the eleven points of the petition on the spot, expressing that they should be accepted and immediately submitted to the conference for resolution and forwarded to the government for adoption and implementation. Finally, the petition group shouted, "The situation is serious, and the country is in danger. If only verbal expressions of acceptance are made and are not actively implemented in practice, the petition will be in vain and the national affairs will be unimaginable. We sincerely hope that the representatives of the delegation will provide a practical guarantee, and that the conference will, in any case, establish concrete guidelines based on the above principles, supervise the government, implement them immediately, and without hesitation." Cai replied, "Of course, we will do so." The crowd then shouted slogans and returned in formation. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Meeting to Relieve the Coal Shortage Continued Yesterday</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Coal Industry Association, and the China National Coal Production and Sales Federation, reiterating the measures stipulated in the case of temporarily suspending coal transportation price increases on the Jiaoji Railway for three months: 1. Coal exported from Shandong Province should be transported to Shanghai as much as possible, solely for domestic use; 2. During the national crisis, coal prices must not increase; 3. Coal should continue to be supplied to the Jiaoji Railway at low prices. These measures have been agreed upon and promised by the representatives of the chamber, and should not be changed. If mines with existing contracts and government-approved foreign investment are excluded, then most of the coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway are jointly operated with Japanese investment, and the coal produced is also shipped to Japan. Only a small amount is usually sold to Shanghai. Now that price increases are prohibited, it will inevitably still be transported to Japan to achieve the purpose of making profits. Coal merchants are using the domestic coal shortage as an excuse to call for reduced transportation costs, but the result is only to supply cheap coal to Japanese users, while coal merchants profit from it. The domestic coal shortage still cannot be relieved. The association should find ways to correct this situation to achieve thorough relief, and we hope for a detailed reply.

<h3>Developments in German Politics</h3>
<p>National Socialism Thriving</p>
<p>Possibility of Liaison with the Central Party</p>
<p>Berlin dispatch, 17th (National News) The current internal political situation in Germany shows rapid development, which is closely related to the general trend in Europe. In the Hesse election a few days ago, the National Socialist Party won a great victory. The results of this move greatly affect the Catholic Central Party, because the party's position is really in a dilemma. In the future, will it unite with the left-wing parties to form a new government that is precarious, or will it combine with the National Socialist Party? If it does combine with the National Socialist Party, the whole country will follow suit, and the various states will follow suit. Here, political leaders do not deny the possibility of the Central Party and the National Socialist Party discussing the link, and although they do not actively promote the combination, they think that the matter is not completely impossible. Premier Bruning's personal views may also be the same. He does not agree with National Socialism, but he feels that since National Socialism is now so magnificent, in terms of principle, it should be given a chance to gradually change its negative attitude and adopt a proactive policy. Furthermore, Bruning also wants to use the National Socialist Party to control a part of the political power, thereby destroying the united front of the right wing. The Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Party, which were previously combined with the National Socialist Party, are excluded from Bruning's new plan. Bruning is secretly colluding with the National Socialist Party on the one hand, but on the other hand, he has not abandoned his long-standing contact with the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party has now demanded that Bruning publicly and clearly reject the National Socialist Party and cancel all its ruling movements, and declared that if Bruning cannot do this, it will be difficult to continue to cooperate in the future, and will join the non-governmental faction to support the reorganization of the Congress, which is tantamount to the death knell of the Bruning government, and Bruning can not call on any ability without the support of the Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Paris dispatch, 18th (Havas) The agenda of the Chamber of Deputies is the discussion of foreign policy questions. Briand attended and answered, and did not leave the House until 6 pm. The leader of the left-wing Radical Party spoke about relations with Russia, saying that France's failure to trade with the Soviet Union has led to closer relations with other countries, which he deeply regretted. He also said that when France and Soviet Russia conducted treaty negotiations in 1927, newspapers, under the influence of a certain British and American oil trust, opposed the treaty and made it impossible to establish.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<h3>Receiving International Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>Now, if we want to reopen negotiations, the Soviet Union's dumping policy will be a stumbling block, and the intervention of industrialists will also have an impact. For the present plan, we should first set a non-aggression treaty and an immigration treaty for overseas Chinese as the first step in the process, and then engage in negotiations to conclude a formal commercial treaty, as well as to conclude an agreement to resolve debts and to determine the purchase of goods and the extension of payments, because the Soviet Union recognizes its debts to France, but requires France to borrow from it. Then a member of the Social Radical Party stood up and gave a speech, talking about the financial relations between France and Germany and the policy of the United States toward Europe. He Yun, Europe can not rely on the United States, and the United States can not ask for Europe. We have 400 million US dollars in cash, but we are debtors to the United States. The fall of the US dollar is beneficial to us. Although the Americans know that they cannot be isolated, they do not want to join the League of Nations. Finally, the member of parliament said that international compromise is necessary.</p>

Gandhi's strong attitude made the British representatives Reading and Sankey feel very difficult. Some Indian representatives did not agree with Gandhi's extreme demands.</p>
<p>Calcutta dispatch, 18th (Reuters) The Indian Swaraj Party is gradually becoming uneasy about the progress of the Indian Round Table Conference in London and Gandhi's delayed return to India.

<h3>Resurgence of the Tao'ang War</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Fierce Battles on the 12th and 13th</p>
<p>Honzō Shigeru's Ultimatum and Our Reply</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese army's attempt to attack Hei was unsuccessful, suffering a defeat between Tailai and the Jiangqiao bridge. Feeling quite humiliated, they have been working hard to replenish their troops in an attempt to break through our line of defense in one fell swoop. At 12:00 noon on the 12th, they first used intimidation tactics to issue an ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Hei Province, demanding a reply by 12:00 midnight. The original ultimatum contained three restrictions, roughly translated as follows: "This officer requests the following from your side: (1) Chairman Ma Zhanshan should step down; (2) The Heilongjiang Province army should withdraw from Qiqihar; (3) A portion of the Japanese army, for the sake of ensuring the safety of the Tao'ang line, should begin its advance from the Ang'angxi station on the Tao'ang line. Please submit a reply to this by 12:00 midnight on November 12th. Respectfully addressed to Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, Commander of the Kwantung Army, Honzō Shigeru, November 12th, Showa Year 6," and so on. This document was delivered to the Hei Province government by Hayashi, a naval attache from the Japanese consulate in Hei City. After receiving it, Ma Zhanshan immediately sent an urgent telegram to Beiping, requesting instructions from Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang. He received a reply from Zhang, stating: "(1) Is this ultimatum issued by Honzō personally, or does it represent the Tokyo government? (2) Honzō's representative, Hayashi, did not carry any identification, and a mere telegram is insufficient proof. (3) The ultimatum arrived at noon, but before waiting for a reply, Japanese cavalry and artillery units launched a fierce attack on our positions. What is the reason for this? Even if we take a step back and assume Hayashi represents Honzō, and Honzō represents the Japanese government, there is no reason to demand that our army retreat. We should firmly reject it and defend to the end," and so on. The war began at 2:15 PM on the 12th. Ma Zhanshan left the ultimatum unanswered until noon on the 13th, when he replied, rejecting the three demands, stating: "(1) Stepping down is not impossible, but it requires an order from the Chinese government and the dispatch of personnel to take over. Even if the government appoints Zhang Haipeng, the political power will not be handed over. (2) Regarding the withdrawal of troops, we have the right to do so within our own Chinese territory, and the Japanese side has no right to interfere. (3) Ang'angxi Station is a station jointly operated by China and Russia. Your request for withdrawal contradicts Representative Yoshizawa's statement in the League of Nations that "Japan has no territorial ambitions." Furthermore, I am ordered to defend the territory, and I cannot comply until I receive a clear order from my government to abandon it. At the same time, in terms of legal facts, it is not something your country should demand," and so on. Regarding this reply and the original text of Honzō's ultimatum, Ma has telegraphed our representative to the League of Nations, Shi Zhaoji, instructing him to present it to the assembly. As for the war, before 2:15 PM on the 12th, the Japanese army first used more than 500 cavalry and artillery soldiers to launch a fierce attack on the left flank of our cavalry brigade under Wu, stationed in Wunotou Zhangjiahuayuan (in the three rooms of the Daxing station), firing like a string of pearls. Our cavalry was suppressed and chased, and the position was on the verge of wavering. Fortunately, the soldiers were determined and persevered in resisting. The Japanese army attacked fiercely for 40 minutes but failed to achieve its goal and retreated. Our army also suffered casualties at that time, including two deputy company commanders, one adjutant, and fourteen soldiers killed in battle. The war briefly subsided, but before an hour had passed, the Japanese army launched another attack with a large force, using all its strength to deal with our army, encircling our line of defense, and using eight heavy artillery pieces to fiercely attack our cavalry and artillery positions. The Japanese army, with more than 6,000 soldiers, was divided into three branches, with brigade commanders Hase and Amano each responsible for the left and right wings, and Mori, commander of the Manchurian Railway garrison, acting as the central commander. More than ten aircraft also dropped bombs from the air. Their heavy artillery was extremely powerful, and many sections of our trenches were destroyed. Yuan Zonggu, the commander-in-chief at the front, seeing that Wu's brigade was in danger, transferred a regiment from Zhang Dianjiu's brigade from the second and third lines of defense to join the front and help resist the enemy. After 6:00 PM, the enemy army, unable to gain an advantage, retreated in large numbers and switched to artillery attacks, firing hundreds of rounds. Our army also returned fire with artillery. At 7:30 PM, the artillery attack stopped, and the Japanese army resumed using small teams of cavalry, about a dozen men per group, to repeatedly harass our positions. Our army retaliated, and they fled far away. If we did not attack, they would approach our trenches. The fighting completely stopped after 8:00 PM. After 11:00 PM in the evening, they began to attack again. Until about 1:00 AM on the 13th, they twice charged our trenches with handheld machine guns, but were repelled by our army. At about 2:00 AM, the war resumed. At about 5:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army attacked our Xinlitu village position again with more than 500 soldiers. At about 7:00 AM, two aircraft provided cover in the air, dropping more than 30 bombs. Armored vehicles also fired artillery from across the river. At about 10:00 AM, they retreated again without achieving anything. At noon, another aircraft came to reconnoiter our line of defense in the Jiangqiao area, dropping six bombs, killing five of our soldiers and wounding two. They were repelled by our army's artillery fire. During the two days, the Japanese army attacked continuously, and the officers and soldiers at the front were unable to rest day and night. Ma Zhanshan, fearing that the soldiers were too tired and that the line of defense would be difficult to consolidate, urgently telegraphed the independent cavalry eighth brigade under Cheng Zhiyuan, stationed in Manzhouli Zhalannuoer, and the Gan and Liu regiments to go to the front to take over the defense. The Tu regiment arrived in Ang'angxi on the evening of the 13th, and the Liu regiment will arrive tomorrow. Zhang Haipeng's troops did not participate in this war. It is said that because his soldiers were unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese army, they lacked fighting spirit and did not listen to Japanese orders. A part of Zhang's army, which had detoured to Jingxing, has been contacted and reorganized by Ma Zhanshan, and there has been considerable progress. Another piece of news is that Zhang Haipeng himself, feeling that the Japanese army was coercing him too much, killed the Japanese who was monitoring him on the evening of the 12th and fled with more than ten of his confidants. Zhang's troops lost their commander, leading to disintegration. Whether this is true or not remains to be investigated. (14th)</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post's Harbin dispatch on the 16th stated: According to a long-distance telephone call from Qiqihar, yesterday the Japanese army ambushed the side of the Chinese army on the Tao'ang Road, attempting to cut off the transportation line. The fierce battle lasted all day and was almost a complete annihilation. General Ma Zhanshan's troops captured 500 Japanese soldiers, and also captured two Japanese field guns and countless bullets. The Japanese casualties totaled more than 60. The Japanese army used a right-wing encirclement tactic, aiming to cut off the transportation line between the Chinese army on the front line and the headquarters in Ang'angxi. General Ma Zhanshan used 4,000 cavalry to fight back, finally surrounding the Japanese army and isolating it from the armored vehicles that followed to provide cover. Although the Japanese army used aircraft to drop bombs, the damage was minimal because of the sandy soil. From 8:00 AM in the morning, the fierce battle lasted until dusk, almost completely annihilating the Japanese army. The last remaining part of the Japanese army took advantage of the dusk, with the cover of the armored vehicle's artillery fire, to break out of the encirclement and retreat to the Nenjiang River bank. The Chinese army's line of defense then advanced several miles, about 30 miles from Ang'angxi Station and about six miles from the Nenjiang Bridge. The people of Harbin were very excited when they heard the news of the great victory of Ma Zhanshan's army, as if they had been electrified. Various groups and schools raised funds and winter clothes and transported them to the front lines to comfort the soldiers. It is said that hundreds of students have gone to join Ma's army. The Harbin military police now have 10,000 road protection soldiers under Ding Chao and 5,600 policemen under Wang Renhua (transliteration), both of whom expressed sympathy for Ma Zhanshan. Recently, Zhang Jinghui's newly formed security team of 2,500 people heard today that about 4,000 soldiers from Jilin province who were unwilling to be commanded by Xi Qia gathered at the Ashihe Station on the Middle East Road, all of whom were trained soldiers. It is said that a part of them have gone to Qiqihar to join the war of resistance against Japan. The Harbin Times, run by the Japanese in this area, printed the news of Puyi's restoration in Shenyang on the front page in large characters today, saying that Puyi had been restored yesterday, but the enthronement ceremony still needs to be postponed. It also said that the Japanese have reached an agreement with Puyi to resolve all outstanding issues in the three northeastern provinces. It also carried a speech by Uchida, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, saying that the Japanese army not only cannot withdraw, but must increase greatly to maintain the Japanese position.</p>
<p>The Harbin dispatch of the 17th of the North China Daily News stated that several Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on Fularji town on the Middle East Railway to the west of Qiqihar, destroying railway houses and warehouses, fearing that they would attack Qiqihar.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Japanese Smuggling Puyi out of Tianjin</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: After Doihara, who called himself a "China expert," arrived in Tianjin with Jin Liang on the 2nd of this month, he went to visit Puyi to persuade him to go through the pass to restore the throne. Puyi dared not agree, and Doihara threatened him with dangerous words and left in disappointment. On the night of the 6th, a bomb was found in a fruit basket in Puyi's residence, which was also a coercive trick by Doihara. At the same time, Doihara and others sought other ways and went to Zheng Xiaoxu, a remnant of the Qing dynasty, with Jin Liang, to explain the plan of restoration in detail, saying that if Puyi was restored to the throne, Japan would definitely provide assistance with strength. Zheng's mind was simple, only knowing loyalty to the emperor but not patriotism. Moreover, his son, Yan Zuo, was blinded by greed for profit, and he incited his father, saying that the Republic of China had really let down the royal family (probably referring to being driven out of the palace and stopping the preferential treatment fee). Now that there is this opportunity, the Japanese can be used to avenge this shame. Even if it fails, at the very least, he can move to Tokyo like the Yi Wang of Korea and enjoy happiness, and so on. Zheng was moved by this and agreed. He then went to visit Puyi with Doihara and Jin Liang, making various inducements. Puyi was originally a child, how could he know the general trend? However, because many former Qing officials still opposed it, and the Japanese side wanted Puyi to establish a new country title, he was even more dissatisfied and showed hesitation. Therefore, Zheng and Jin negotiated with Doihara again. Finally, Doihara said that if Mr. Puyi is willing to restore the throne, then regarding the issue of the country title, whether to establish a new name or restore the old name, it is all possible. It is also no problem to continue using the Xuantong era name. At present, please Mr. Pu first go to Dalian, and everything can be discussed at length, and so on. Jin Liang and Zheng Xiaoxu used this to flatter Puyi again. This confused and mediocre child was forced by internal and external forces, so he disregarded everything and decided to relive his old dream of being an emperor. Doihara's plan of instigation has already succeeded, and he also fears that the Chinese side will pay attention to this matter. In order to divert attention, he betrayed Zhang Bi, Li Jichun, etc., and recruited plainclothes teams, which led to the Tianjin Incident on the 8th. Puyi took advantage of the plainclothes teams' disturbances on the night of the 10th, took his father Zai Cheng and his wife, as well as three eunuchs, and Doihara, Jin Liang, Zheng Xiaoxu, and his son Yan Zuo in disguise, left Tianjin and took a boat to Dalian. (16th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Since Puyi was forced to leave Ping in the 13th year of the Republic of China, he has lived in the Japanese concession in Tianjin for seven years. The Japanese had planned this long ago, thinking that he was a rare commodity and gave him special protection. Two years ago, Puyi originally had the intention of traveling abroad, but he did not succeed because Japanese friends dissuaded him. This time, the Japanese army forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin, intending to occupy them permanently. However, in order to take into account international considerations, they had to form a puppet government, actually grasping military and political power themselves. This play cannot be summoned without supporting the deposed emperor Puyi. Therefore, they first sent Doihara to Tianjin. Doihara was very familiar with the situation in China and could speak Chinese. After arriving in Tianjin, he was introduced by Kashii, the Japanese commander in Tianjin, to meet Puyi. Puyi knew that the Japanese side was using him as a temporary puppet, and he was reluctant at first. Doihara repeatedly persuaded him, but he politely declined. Finally, Doihara angrily changed his face, saying, "The Japanese government has protected your safety for several years. Now we want to help you restore the Qing Dynasty, which is really benevolent and righteous. If you don't listen to me, I'm afraid the disaster of killing yourself is at hand. After Puyi was threatened, he asked to discuss it later and discussed the response with his veterans Zheng Xiaoxu, Chen Shichen, and Zhu Yifan. Zheng said that the situation is like this, so he had to follow temporarily. However, Chen and Zhu strongly opposed, saying that if he didn't go, he would die, and if he went, safety would be difficult to guarantee, and he would also lose the sympathy of the Republic of China. Puyi also hesitated. At that time, Puyi's private residence was already under surveillance by the Japanese, and all communication with the outside world was completely lost. After several days of struggle, as a result, he had no choice but to be coerced to Shenyang. At about 12:00 on the evening of the 10th, he led his wife and three eunuchs and set off from his private residence. Zheng Xiaoxu and others also followed, and several armed Japanese soldiers protected them from behind. They arrived at the wharf in the Japanese concession, took a small steamer, and went down the coast through the British and French concessions in the Third Special District and the First Special District, arrived at Tanggu, and changed to the Japanese destroyer Kari. It is now said that he has arrived in Dalian.</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Crisis Still Lurks</h3>
<p>Although the Tianjin Authorities are Trying to Compromise</p>
<p>The Plainclothes Teams are Still Harassing</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: On the night of the 8th, the plainclothes teams attacked various Chinese institutions from the Japanese concession. For the sake of self-defense, our local police and security teams had no choice but to open fire. Because the plainclothes teams attacked from the Japanese concession, bullets easily flew into the Japanese concession when the security police fired. Therefore, at 5:30 AM on the 9th, when the plainclothes teams were unable to support themselves, the Japanese commander Kashii suddenly protested to our Second Army headquarters by telephone, saying that the Chinese military police (in fact, there was only the security team at that time, no army) opened fire on the Japanese concession and shot and killed several of his officers and soldiers. He should immediately order the military police to retreat 300 meters, otherwise the Japanese army would take necessary measures for self-defense. The so-called necessary measures, in essence, are free action. For the sake of appeasing people and maintaining peace, the provincial and municipal authorities compromised and ordered the police to retreat 300 meters. Unexpectedly, the more we retreated, the more the Japanese pressed on. Not only did the plainclothes teams continue to cause trouble as before, but the 300 meters that had been withdrawn were almost regarded by the Japanese side as an appendage of the Japanese concession, and they interfered with our actions everywhere. The other day, the Japanese consul suddenly proposed to our side that China and Japan jointly inspect the 300-meter area to see if there were any plainclothes teams. The intention of the Japanese side was nothing more than to worry that Britain, the United States, and other countries might advocate demarcating the 300-meter area as a buffer zone. In this case, the Japanese concession would be blockaded by various countries and would not be able to operate. Therefore, on the one hand, they used diplomatic means to deceive various countries with deceptive words. On the other hand, they requested China to jointly search, but they did not know that since the plainclothes teams were under the command of the Japanese, of course they would not stick to being caught. Moreover, this 300-meter area is the complete territory of China, and China has its own discretion whether to search or not. Even if there is a need to search, there is no need for the Japanese side to propose it. However, our authorities actually agreed to the Japanese request and jointly searched. It was originally scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on the 12th. At that time, our side sent a team of security teams to the gate to discuss the inspection method. The Japanese soldiers glared at each other and refused to inspect. Later, our side questioned the Japanese consul about breaking the appointment. The Japanese consul said that it was not a breach of appointment, but that the translator had made a mistake in the date. It is now scheduled to jointly inspect at 9:00 AM on the 14th. On the morning of the 14th, our side sent 40 security team members, and the Japanese side sent 40 military police, each led by a civil and military official, and divided into two groups. The first group was at the gate, and the second group was at Haiguang Temple.</p>
<p>The Japanese vice consul Goto entertained foreign guests and accompanied them on the tour. His intention was very far-reaching. The first group searched in front of the telephone two bureau door, about 200 meters from the gate. The Japanese pavilion was in an uproar, saying that there should be no defensive works such as telephone networks and sandbags in this area within 300 meters. After our side told them that the telephone bureau was related to the communication of Chinese and foreign people, it could not be without considerable defense. The Japanese side did not understand, so they stopped the inspection. The second group started from Haiguang Temple, but the Japanese side refused to inspect the two districts and six offices occupied by the Japanese army. As a result, the security team only walked on the road and dealt with the matter perfunctorily. Therefore, it was not possible to realize the Japanese soldiers retreating 50 meters and the Chinese and Japanese police resuming their posts as scheduled after the inspection. The Japanese consul used this as an excuse to send a telegram to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and notify the consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin, claiming that "Chinese rioters rioted on the night of the 8th of this month and engaged in street battles with Chinese military police. Japanese military officers and Japanese soldiers died by bullets. China accepted the warning of the Japanese consul stationed in Tianjin and retreated beyond 300 meters from the Japanese concession at dawn on the 9th. This is a common sight and sound. However, the Chinese side claims that plainclothes teams have been found in this 300-meter area in recent days. In order to eliminate the rioters, the two sides each sent military police to jointly inspect on the 14th. Defensive works such as telephone networks and sandbags were found in the 300-meter area, which clearly shows that China is not keeping its promises. As a result of the inspection, no trace of plainclothes teams was found, which can prove that Japan has absolutely no protection for rioters. Three security team members were found in the residential houses, who were the ones who shot and killed Japanese officers and soldiers," and so on. On the one hand, they sent a telegram to the Japanese embassy to ask for a protest to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, they directly protested to the provincial and municipal authorities and asked the municipal government to personally apologize to the Japanese pavilion. Mayor Zhang Xueming had not been able to sleep for a week since the incident occurred, and he suffered from laryngitis. At 6:00 PM on the 14th, he sent representative Ning Xiangnan to the Japanese consulate to explain that Mayor Zhang could not come due to illness. The Japanese consul was unhappy, saying that if he could not come due to illness, he had to make a formal written apology. On the afternoon of the 15th, Zhang sent Liu Jialuan, a counselor of the Second Army, to the Japanese consulate with a letter of apology. Wang Shuchang, on the other hand, went to the Haiguang Temple Japanese barracks at 4:30 PM on the 15th with Shen Dijia Ning Xiangnan to meet with the Japanese commander Kashii. Japanese soldiers surrounded them several times in full armor, with the air of a Hongmen Banquet. At 8:30 PM, Wang was forced to admit the following three conditions: (1) When China and Japan jointly inspected the plainclothes teams on November 14, it was found that there were defensive works within 300 meters of the Japanese concession, and the guns of the security team were facing the Japanese concession. We hereby apologize to the Japanese authorities. (2) Suppress propaganda that is detrimental to Japan's reputation. (3) The defensive works in the 300-meter area will be removed, and the security team will not be allowed to enter this area, but the police may serve with handguns. At 8:40, it was written in Japanese, and Wang signed it before he was able to leave the Japanese barracks and return to the Chinese boundary.</p>
<p>The telephone network in front of the No. 2 Telephone Bureau was actually removed yesterday (15th) afternoon, and the security team also retreated. Our authorities asked the Japanese side to return the two districts and six offices occupied by the Japanese soldiers and to retreat the Japanese soldiers at each intersection 50 meters to restore the posts of the Chinese and Japanese police. The Japanese authorities not only did not agree, but further demanded that our side allocate the Zhongxi Girls' School in the South Guanzitou as the Japanese military office and withdraw the troops 20 miles away. At 10:40 last night, more than 2,000 plainclothes teams were found in the Haiguang Temple area, attacking our line of defense. Our security team was ordered to stop shooting, so they used the telephone to ask the municipal government for instructions. Zhang Xueming immediately telegraphed the Japanese barracks, saying that according to reports, more than 2,000 plainclothes teams were found in the Haiguang Temple area, attacking us very fiercely. For the sake of defense, we must open fire. Please do not misunderstand. Kashii said that whether the security team opens fire or not is up to you, but bullets must not be shot into the Japanese barracks and the Japanese concession. In fact, since the plainclothes teams came out of the Haiguang Temple area and were very close to the Japanese barracks, it would be very easy for stray bullets to fly in if they were counterattacked. Kashii's statement was obviously intended to make things difficult for us. Later, because the plainclothes teams were getting closer and closer, they had directly approached our defense line, and the security team had no choice but to open fire to resist. It was not until 12:30 at night that the rioters were repelled. At 11:30, when the fierce battle was in full swing, the Japanese soldiers opened fire again to cheer them on, and the rumble was deafening. The British, American, and French soldiers defending outside the Qiangzi River heard it all. In short, it has now changed from rioter disturbances to direct contact between China and Japan. The future is bleak, and hidden worries are huge. (16th)</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Japanese Setting up the Showa Agricultural Company in Shenyang</h3>
<p>A Very Poisonous Organization for Seizing Chinese People's Land</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The Japanese organized the Showa Agricultural Company in Shenyang to forcibly occupy the land of the Eastern Provinces and issued thousands of absurd notices. The original text has already been copied in previous reports. Now it is heard that the so-called Showa Agricultural Company was established by Katakura Paper Manufacturing Company with an investment of 50,000 Japanese yen. The managers are Koya Setsuo and Kumagai Kanichi, two former members of the Japanese House of Representatives, who are under the command of the Kwantung Government. In the name of the company, they planned to purchase 60,000 ping of land west of the Fengtian Station on the South Manchuria Railway in preparation for expanding the attached land. The matter was discovered by the authorities, and it was immediately prohibited. Therefore, their plan did not succeed. This was two years ago. Seeing that their plan was not selling, the company spent its money on conspiracy activities to request bribes in order to achieve its goal by any means. However, although the funds were exhausted, no Chinese dared to sell their land. Recently, the company saw that the time had come and obtained the support of the Japanese army. They seized the archives and seals of the Liaoning Finance Office, and then privately forged false contracts and established their own names to transfer the 60,000 ping of land they planned to purchase to the company under the names of the original landowners, and notified the local landowners with printed official letters (as stated in the previous report), ordering them to go to the temporary branch office of the Land Department of the South Manchuria Railway Company to sign new leases and pay taxes according to the regulations. At the same time, they ordered Japanese and Korean ronin to set up markers, delineate boundaries, and have Japanese military police guards. The landowners were terrified because their property was lost in vain. Some went to the so-called temporary branch office of the Land Department of the South Manchuria Railway Company inside the Japanese consulate in Shenyang to register, intending to protect their property in case. However, the Chinese and Japanese personnel in the museum only forced them to sign a lease. There were many conditions in the contract, but they were not allowed to read it, only to sign it, and then drive them out. It is feared that this 60,000 ping of land will soon be transferred into the hands of the Japanese, and the general public will suffer the tragedy of being bankrupted innocently. (16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Communist Party Active in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: According to a person who arrived in Beiping from Shenyang a few days ago, on the evening of the 31st of last month, the Manchuria Medical University was suddenly surrounded by Japanese military police who conducted a major search. As a result, more than twenty Japanese students were arrested, causing chaos throughout the school. After inquiries, it was learned that those arrested were suspected of being communists. It is said that these students, having received higher education, were ideologically clear-headed and extremely dissatisfied with their country's dispatch of troops to the Northeast and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin. They planned to unite and take action, but the plan was leaked to the school authorities, who reported it to the Japanese military, leading to their arrest. In my opinion, since the Northeast Incident, the Japanese Communist Party has also taken the opportunity of their country's troops occupying Liaoning and Jilin to enter Manchuria. Their primary task is to complete the organization of the Japanese Communist Party's Manchuria Local Affairs Bureau. The headquarters is located in Dalian, with four departments: organization, propaganda, technology, and countermeasures. Each department has a director, with seven people including Matsui Takashi as the leaders. Each department also has a liaison system and other labor organizations. The content is very tight and the foundation is very stable. There are about a hundred party members in total, led by another party member, Matsushima, who are carrying out various activities. Their methods are extremely clever. All party members, except for particularly urgent meetings, usually live scattered in remote inns or Japanese residences. They dress elegantly and act discreetly. The work of the technical department is more important, so female party members are assigned to it. The "Manchuria Red Flag" newspaper, published in Fushun, serves as their propaganda organ. It is published twice a month, privately printed by party members using mimeograph, and includes illustrations. The content is highly stimulating and widely distributed. Local branches have also been actively organized in the past month, and are largely complete. They originally planned to take advantage of the Labor Revolution Memorial Day on November 7th to unite with the Korean Communist Party and local bandits to launch a coordinated uprising. However, the plan was leaked and detected by the Japanese police, who first exposed the "Manchuria Red Flag" by the Fushun Japanese Police Station on the 26th of last month. On the 28th, the Dalian Police Station's Ideological Higher Education Department, in cooperation with various detectives, conducted a major search in Dalian. On the 31st, Manchuria Medical University was also searched, and other places followed suit. As a result, more than thirty members of the Japanese Communist Party were arrested, but important leaders such as Matsui Takashi and Matsushima Kan escaped, and many important documents were destroyed. It is said that when the Communist Party in Dalian was exposed, some even fought the police with handguns. Because many of the participants were excellent, their intentions and designs were very meticulous. Although they have suffered this blow, they seem to have suffered no major losses. (16th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Situation Suddenly Turns Serious</h3>
<p>Japanese Ronin Group's Attempted Disturbance in Plainclothes Fails</p>
<p>Japanese Destroyer Fleet Arrives in Qingdao to Demonstrate</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Defense Consolidated, No Other Concerns</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: When the Japanese expatriates in this city held the Shandong Residents' General Meeting at the end of last month, they resolved to make efforts to create a major incident. Since then, they have proceeded according to the resolution, creating trouble everywhere. However, our government, merchants, and people all understand their intentions and are taking strict precautions to avoid conflict. At present, the Japanese are working harder to create incidents in order to provoke negotiations and use this as an excuse to send troops. Therefore, the situation in this city has suddenly become tense in recent days. All shops close early every night, and there are no pedestrians on the streets around 10 p.m. The Public Security Bureau has also imposed martial law in an invisible way, assigning more double guards. The night security team's bicycle team is fully mobilized, deploying in important locations in the city. Each person is issued two hundred bullets for use in case of emergencies. At the important intersections outside the city, the Marine Corps has stationed heavy troops, so the Japanese have no chance to take advantage of, and peace has been maintained. It is said that the Japanese ronin, unable to achieve their goals, have turned to buying Chinese coolies to serve as plainclothes teams, giving each person 200 yuan and multiple bombs. The original plan was to have them bomb various important institutions at night, and the Japanese ronin would then attack in order to cause major negotiations. Unexpectedly, this was discovered by the Public Security Bureau, which took strict precautions in advance. The plainclothes team, intimidated by the force, did not dare to launch an attack. However, the city has been alarmed several times overnight, giving the impression that disaster is imminent.</p>
<p>The Japanese 13th Destroyer Squadron, including the "Hatsukari," "Hayanae," "Kuretake," and "Wakatake" arrived in Qingdao this morning (16th) at 8:50 a.m. from Lushun to demonstrate, and are anchored in the front sea with the flagship "Kuma," ready to be launched at any time, attracting more attention. The details of the four ships are investigated as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Name　Displacement　Number of People　Captain</p>
<p>Hatsukari　900 tons　101 people　Lieutenant Commander Kengo Kadota</p>
<p>Hayanae　Same as above　Same as above　Lieutenant Commander Masao Tachibana</p>
<p>Kuretake　Same as above　Same as above　Lieutenant Commander Masayuki Kitamura</p>
<p>Wakatake　Same as above　Same as above　Lieutenant Commander Tsuneo Kuranaga</p>
<p>Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, because of the tense situation and the extreme importance of the Jiaoji Railway's defense, went to Jinan the day before yesterday to discuss with Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, methods for maintaining the Jiaoji Railway's security. The matter has now been completed, and he returned to Qingdao at 7:30 this morning (16th). According to Ge, the defense along the Jiaoji Railway line is jointly undertaken by the 3rd Route Army and the railway police, and it is now consolidated, with no other concerns. (November 16th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Authorities Strictly Prevent Japanese Riots</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Acting Chairman Fang Shengtao recently received orders to go to Beijing, and yesterday received a telegram from Beijing stating that recently in Shanghai and Tianjin, Japanese rioters have combined to cause trouble, but they have been suppressed and dispersed by the military and police, and local order has been restored immediately. However, the rioters had secretly colluded with thugs in advance, hid in the interior, and took the opportunity to riot. Fujian must take strict precautions to prevent trouble from arising. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government convened a meeting on the 13th with Martial Law Deputy Commander Li Dingzhang, 1st Brigade Commander Jin Zhenzhong, 2nd Brigade Commander Zhou Xiaopei, and Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Guo Yongrong, and resolved to intensify martial law starting that evening, and ordered the martial law department's inspection team, the Public Security Bureau's district offices, and the security and detective teams to divide the area and deploy strictly.</p>
<h3>Wuhu's Large Quantities of Rapeseed Still Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>A Recent Overview of Chinese and Foreign Shipping in the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Rice and rapeseed are the main agricultural products of Anhui Province. Wuhu is a treaty port and a major export hub, and its foreign trade is considerable. According to recent news from shipping circles, since the invasion of Liaoning and Jilin by the violent Japanese, of the nine merchant ships of Japanese registry sailing on the Yangtze River, four are used to transport Japanese expatriates, while the other five are docked in Shanghai, where Chinese ships load cargo. Currently, the Chinese ships engaged in Yangtze River shipping include the China Merchants Bureau's "Jianghua," "Jiang'an," "Jiangshun," "Jiangxin," "Jiangda," "Jing," and "Jianguo." Wuhu's current imports are mostly seafood, etc., so the China Merchants Bureau's cargo ships are piled high with goods, about 10,000 pieces in total. Because they cannot be shipped in time, the Wuhu branch has telegraphed the head office to request a temporary suspension of shipments. Exports are mostly miscellaneous goods, all wholesale from various counties. In addition, the Sanbei Company's "Xinning," "Xingchang," "Xingshi," "Chang'an," "Dexing," and "Ningshao" vessels also sail on the Yangtze River. Previously, business was very dull, but in the past two weeks, because the China Merchants Bureau's passenger and cargo ships were overcrowded, they have also been greatly boosted. Before the Northeast Incident occurred, Japanese ships had a significant advantage in business, carrying mainly rapeseed and rapeseed cake to Japan. According to customs statistics, from April to September of this year, the rapeseed and rapeseed cake transported from Wuhu to Japan were as follows:</p>
<p>Month　Rapeseed Packages　Rapeseed Cake Pieces</p>
<p>April　42,949　7,319</p>
<p>May　2,670　None</p>
<p>June　14,827　None</p>
<p>July　63,899　4,226</p>
<p>August　57,684　4,893</p>
<p>September　8,496　None</p>
<p>In total, there were 163,525 packages of rapeseed (each package weighing 140 catties) and 16,438 pieces of rapeseed cake. Previously, when shipping to Japan, Japanese ships were exclusively used unless absolutely necessary. If a foreign ship was occasionally reported, the Japanese merchants would insist on returning and replacing it with a Japanese ship, which shows how well the Japanese promoted nationalized industries. Now, since September 22nd, Taikoo and Jardine have been used for shipments. However, all sectors in Wuhu believe that shipping so much rapeseed to Japan provides the enemy with raw materials, which conflicts with the principle of economic disengagement. The County Rectification Committee has convened various sectors to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss this issue. (16th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>During the winter defense period, bandits contemplate action. Wu Daoli, a man from Nanjing who operates a tannery outside Niangniang Temple north of Kuatang Bridge in the western suburbs of this city, suddenly heard violent knocking on the door around 1 a.m. yesterday (17th). Wu's son was ill, and many relatives and friends were watching by his bedside. The bandits heard the loud voices inside and knew it would be difficult to succeed, so they fired a shot and left. The relatives and friends opened the door and chased after them, but their shadows disappeared in the dark.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Party Ideology Teacher Fakes Credentials. The Executive Committee of the First District Party Department, in view of the fact that Jiang Liquan of Jiangyin (currently a candidate for the county executive committee), a Party Ideology Teacher who was examined and qualified by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Ideology Teacher Examination Committee, had fabricated his academic qualifications (claiming to have graduated from Peking University and worked as a teacher at Shanghai Minli Middle School and Wuxi Jingzhi Girls' Middle School), as Jiang is a nurse from the Red Swastika Society and passed the examination to become a judicial clerk in the county government, how could he deceive? A decision was made at a meeting the day before yesterday to submit the case to the higher party department for verification.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Notorious bandit Shen Yuanxing apprehended.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Yizheng County representatives come to the province to petition. All butchers in Yizheng County have gone on strike because Zhao Liancheng, the tax collector for the county's slaughter tax, collects taxes without receipts and collects multiple times with one receipt. Furthermore, the police of the county's Public Security Bureau listen to Zhao's false accusations of tax resistance and arbitrarily detain good butchers, causing great harassment. Yesterday, Chen Naichen and Wu Bingchen, the Supervisory Committee members of the county's Chamber of Commerce, came to the province on behalf of the butchers, carrying a petition to the Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs this morning. Yao Bichen, a staff member of the Provincial Government's Public Relations Section, received them on behalf of the government, and Lin Wenqin, the section chief of the Department of Civil Affairs, received them. The results were satisfactory. The prefecture will forward the petition to the department, ordering the county to investigate and respond.</p>
<p>The Provincial Model Factory will be restored. The site of the Provincial Model Silk Weaving Factory is located at Meijiaqiao, Panmen, Suzhou, and was rebuilt from the old copper coin bureau. It has been closed for many years. Part of the buildings was allocated by the former department head to the Rehabilitation Institute for use, and another part was used to store machinery. It was found that there were still newly purchased machines that had not been installed. Upon taking office, Director Shen immediately ordered the technicians and the Fourth Section to jointly plan for the disposal of the machinery to avoid rust and abandonment. Recently, Meng Zubei presented a plan, stating that Jiangsu is rich in silk production and there is a need to promote and improve silk weaving. He requested that the factory buildings be repaired, additional machinery be added, and the factory be restored quickly. He also submitted separate budgets for expenditures and revenues, claiming that an allocation of 10,000 yuan would be enough to start work, and that the annual output would be sold for 195,500 yuan, with a profit of over 8,000 yuan after deducting expenses. Director Shen found the submitted plan insightful and has instructed Section Chief Jin and Technician Wu to review it.</p>
<p>Please thoroughly resolve the obstructing water dikes. The previous Zhenjiang Yantai Taidongxing Flood Relief Association reported that the Yun dike had collapsed, turning five counties into a swamp. The dikes of the downstream salt reclamation companies were blocking the water from entering the sea, causing extreme danger. They jointly petitioned the provincial government, and Commissioner Li Mingyang of the provincial government led a team to open the dikes, as previously reported. When Commissioner Li set out, the association publicly selected Shen Linsen, a flood victim, to accompany him as a guide. Now, Mr. Shen has reported the progress of the handling to the association and has drafted four measures to thoroughly resolve the problem: (1) order the downsizing of districts, (2) order the widening of river channels, (3) dredge the existing river channels, and (4) open the tributaries of the Doulong Port. After discussion, the association considered these measures extremely important and has submitted them to the provincial government, ordering the salt reclamation companies to promptly seek remedies.</p>
<p>Relief for unemployed silk factory workers. The Weilun Silk Factory has not resumed operations after receiving the maintenance public bonds. The unemployed workers, concerned about their livelihood, have repeatedly requested relief from the party and government organs, but Zhang Shaoqin, the factory manager, has avoided appearing. The county party and government organs have now decided on a solution, ordering the factory to resume operations. The county party department, the county government, and the Public Security Bureau will supervise the start of operations, which should continue until the 17,000 yuan in public bonds have been exhausted, after which the factory will be allowed to close. The public bonds should be deposited in a bank by the factory, with certification from the county party department, the county government, and the Public Security Bureau. If the factory still fails to start operations within ten days, the three organs will devise a solution.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Court reorganization and upgrade issues. The Nantong County Court has been ordered to reorganize and upgrade to a District Court to facilitate appeals of civil and criminal cases from various counties in northern Jiangsu. The required funding of 10,000 yuan must be raised locally. President Jian, facing difficulties in proceeding, has gone to the High Court for instructions.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The teacher debt collection tide remains difficult to resolve. All social education institutions and small schools in Jiangdu have been on strike for ten days, and there is still no solution to the issue of unpaid salaries. Therefore, they have each selected representatives, wearing symbols, and gathered at the Education Bureau to sit and demand their salaries. By nightfall, there was still no resolution, so Inspector Liu Yin'nan came out to persuade them to return temporarily. On the morning of the 17th, they returned to the Education Bureau to sit and demand their salaries. It is said that Director Ning has no solution either and plans to visit the county magistrate for instructions. However, the parents of the students, concerned that the long strike will completely deprive their children of education, plan to form a joint association of parents of children from various schools, notify all parents, and schedule a public lecture at the Ma Shen Temple public lecture hall at 2 p.m. on the 22nd to discuss an appropriate maintenance plan.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from the District Chiefs of Changshu County</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We were extremely surprised to read in the local correspondence column of your esteemed newspaper on the 8th an item about the Changshu District Chief gambling with prostitutes. After dinner on the 4th, we accompanied Mr. Yan Zhihe of Shuqin Girls' Middle School and Mr. Dai Liangxiang, a tax collector from the Finance Bureau's East Counter, to watch a play at the theater in the south of our city. There were also others sitting with us and the theater manager can also testify to this. The report in your newspaper is likely based on inaccurate rumors. We are writing this special letter to request a correction and to clarify the truth by publishing this letter in your "Letters" column.</p>

<h3>Jida Teachers and Staff Send a Telegram Opposing the Sale of Detained Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Teachers and Staff of Jida Sent a Telegram: To the Shanghai Newspaper Offices, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee, and forwarded to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee: The news that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has resolved on measures to dispose of the confiscated Japanese goods has shocked the citizens of the city. The news of the collapse of the economic severance of relations line has just come out, and rumors of a great alliance of merchants to sabotage the boycott of goods have suddenly arrived. The resolution of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce echoes this, and the clues are obvious. There must be unscrupulous and crazy scum who have offered this suggestion to ruin the lifeline of the country, and there must be cunning merchants who are willing to harm themselves in order to harm others and help them succeed. Now that this last line of defense has been removed, it will soon be seen that the seas are turbulent, and our Chinese people will be reduced to slaves forever. How can one be devoid of conscience, not to mention being patriotic, but also not considering one's own family and future generations? Repentance should be swift. The previous resolution on the confiscation of Japanese goods should be corrected as soon as possible and await the resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem before making plans to defend the country. Otherwise, the citizens of the city will deal with the merchants with the ultimate determination. The entire faculty and staff of National Jinan University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>

<p>Telegram to Military Commander Zhang Fakui. To Military Commander Zhang Fakui of the Fourth Army, the Japanese are bullying us, and the whole country shares a common hatred. The Northeast border defense army, with its non-resistance policy, blindly tied its hands, and retreated at the mere sight of the enemy, allowing the mad bandits to drive straight in, leaving Liaoning and Jilin in turmoil and Heilongjiang in a precarious situation. Fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan deeply understands the importance of defending our land and fulfills the duty of a soldier, swearing to defend the frontier with Tian Heng's five hundred men and Shaokang's one旅, defending Heilongjiang and fighting for the honor of the Party and the country. The enemy's胆 has been broken, and the violent Japanese know that there are people here. However, it is difficult for General Ma to express the hardships endured by the isolated army resisting a powerful enemy. The survival of our national people is at stake, and they are纷纷remitting money to aid the Heilongjiang army. This proves that the people do not want the country to perish. All soldiers who fight for the survival of the country will be assisted by the people. Now, the enemy's heavy troops are pressing in, and they will use the forces of the whole country to overthrow our孤軍. The crisis of survival is imminent. Now, Military Commander, with your determination to serve the country, you have requested to fight the Japanese. Your telegram has been spread to the national people and they are paying their respects. From now on, Zhang in the south and Ma in the north can be called the country's two绝. The military commander is going to the battlefield and 比诸the military leaders of Liaoning and Jilin, who took the non-resistance policy and scattered to flee in争先恐后, the difference in character is more than that of宵坏. This organization is in the heart of the county's members and with 愛戴之忱, this organization respectfully sends a telegram to express praise, and implores you to send troops in a 克日, in a 共禦 foreign aggression, this organization will do everything in 綿薄 to serve as the rear. Shanghai County Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>To the Provincial Party Headquarters. After the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, seeing the lack of resistance of the国軍 and advancing step by step, it wanted to try to swallow Heilongjiang. The land is on the border, and it has become the second goal of the Japanese. A large-scale offensive is underway, and the situation is critical. If it were not for our loyal and courageous Chairman Ma Zhanshan's defense, the situation would have been the second to沈阳. His spirit of defending the country and fighting hard is admirable. In addition to gathering the people of the county and谋 to assist with economic strength, we are deeply concerned that the Heilongjiang army is isolated on the border, its strength is weak, although its brave spirit连 defeated the enemy, but in the long run, there is恐 that it may not be able to make the defending, hard-fighting army, fall into an indefensible situation. This is not the intention of the people of our country. It has been reported that the Fourth Army Commander Zhang Fakui电, wants to go to the battlefield to serve the country, abandon内争, and go to the national disaster. His warm-blooded righteous act is rare and can be regarded as the 先声 of awakening the country's military, resisting the violent Japanese strong army. It is 敢具presenting to the military,懇 requesting to submit to the central government on the same day, to调 the army to the battlefield,協 the Black 省, and also拨 send the military, to充 the 黑省军. The future of the country is deeply reliant, Presented to the 省黨部,</p>

General Manager Guo and the Business Department discussed the matter yesterday and decided that, since it concerned an order from the Ministry, it had to be carried out. Initially, it was planned to send the Xinming ship. However, since it was carrying a large amount of cargo to Tianjin, the ship had already departed and would not be able to go to Japan until the 30th of this month. Since that date was too late, it was decided to send the Xin Feng ship to Yokohama instead. The ship is currently under repair and will depart as soon as it leaves the dock. The Ministry has already been notified.</p>
<p>Telegraph to Japan to Handle Procedures. Yesterday morning, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a telegram to the Consul-General in Yokohama to inquire about the number of overseas Chinese and the entry, exit, and docking procedures for the ship upon arrival in Japan. Since the company's ships did not have passenger ship licenses for foreign voyages, it was necessary to obtain them before departure. After sending this telegram, the company received a reply telegram from Consul Zhou in Yokohama in the afternoon, which only stated that there were over a thousand overseas Chinese waiting to be transported but did not mention any procedures upon arrival. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company considered the matter to be of great importance and did not want to act hastily. Another telegram was sent in the afternoon to inquire further. The departure date will be determined after a reply is received. According to a company insider, the departure should take place within two or three days.</p>
<h3>Wu Chao-shu on the League of Nations</h3>
<p>It is not yet time to hope that the League of Nations will help the weak and eliminate the strong.</p>
<p>We should not be overly disappointed as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>We should understand its strength and use it well.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Manchurian Incident has relied almost entirely on the League of Nations to resolve it. The League of Nations Administrative</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The academy is holding a meeting in Paris. All Chinese people have great hopes for the League of Nations. Reporters from various news agencies believed that Mr. Wu Yunti had twice been the chief representative of China to the League of Nations and had also served as the vice-chairman of the League of Nations. He should know the inside story of the League of Nations, so they visited him and recorded his conversation. Wu said, "There are two types of people in the world who are not good friends of the League of Nations: those who look down on the League of Nations and those who value it too much. If we want to discuss the League of Nations calmly, we should first understand how much power the League of Nations has, and then we will know how to use the League of Nations well. We must know that the League of Nations is not a government, listed alongside other countries in the world, and especially not a supreme government above the governments of other countries. One point is easiest to prove: on October 24, the League of Nations Administrative Council had a resolution limiting Japan to withdraw its Manchurian army to the South Manchuria Railway by November 16. After unanimous passage by the representatives of various countries, the Japanese representative did not approve. Therefore, although this proposal has great power in public opinion, it has no legal effect. Someone asked me, 'Why does the League of Nations Charter stipulate this way? One country's opposition makes the resolution ineffective?' I replied that all resolutions of the League of Nations, except those concerning procedural issues, must be unanimously passed before they take effect. Because each country is an independent and autonomous country, the League of Nations is not a supreme government, and countries cannot listen to its orders. The League of Nations has a very important mission, which is to uphold world justice and maintain world peace. Needless to say, this mission requires an extremely powerful mechanism to bear it. To be honest, the League of Nations in thirty years may be able to bear it, but the League of Nations today is not certain. We must know that the governments of all countries in the world have a long history, some for thousands of years, and others for a hundred or so years. The League of Nations has only been twelve years old since it was born this year. It has no soldiers of its own, and not even money. Its expenses are entirely provided by member states. Not only do countries not listen to the orders of the League of Nations, but the League of Nations should not look at the nose of the countries. Although the League of Nations has a general assembly and an administrative council, behind it there is also a secretariat, secretly manipulating the power of the right and left, and the power of the secretariat is in the hands of two or three strong countries. With this kind of reason, if two weak countries have disputes and appeal to the League of Nations, the League of Nations may be able to uphold justice. If two strong countries have disputes, the League of Nations already feels that it is difficult to be a person. However, it may still be able to uphold justice. If one strong and one weak have disputes, it is difficult to hope that it will uphold justice. We cannot be disappointed in the League of Nations because of this, but we can only say that it does not have this power today, hoping that others will have this power on their own. A twelve-year-old child is asked to lift a thousand pounds, and the child cannot lift it. It is not the child's fault, but the order is immeasurable. Someone said, 'Does the League of Nations Charter stipulate that there is a method of economic绝交? Is it possible to achieve it?' However, the resolution of the League of Nations is the resolution of each member. If Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and other countries are unwilling to make significant sacrifices and use this fierce method to deal with Japan, then the League of Nations will not have a resolution of economic绝交. So what ability and what role does this twelve-year-old League of Nations have? In my opinion, there are three points: (1) Propaganda effect. The League of Nations is the world's agency, and the world's newspapers often send reporters to Geneva. When there are important meetings, reporters are temporarily sent again. There are three or four hundred newspapers around the world that send commissioners. Therefore, the League of Nations can be used as the world's largest broadcasting station. If there is something unfair, appeal to the League of Nations, and the whole world will hear it, which can issue a mobilization order to world opinion. (2) When the General Assembly and the Administrative Council of the League of Nations are held, the world's great politicians and diplomats will come here. Representatives of various countries can associate with each other from morning to night, and discuss with each other. They can make private friendships, and they can solve international outstanding cases. Therefore, the League of Nations is a good talking room. (3) In addition to politics and diplomacy, countries around the world have many common relationships, such as drug prevention, hygiene, science, and protection of women and children, which cannot be won. The League of Nations promotes or presides over it, so the League of Nations can be said to be the world's chain. At present, the role of the League of Nations is these three. It is hoped that it will uphold justice, help the weak and eliminate the strong, which is at least a matter of twenty years. It is not yet talked about today. In the past, there were many people in China who looked down on the League of Nations, because they did not understand the three functions of the League of Nations mentioned above. Recently, there are many people in China who value the League of Nations too much, thinking that the cause of twenty years can be done by the League of Nations today. When the League of Nations cannot do it, they are greatly disappointed. Therefore, from the people who value the League of Nations too much, they will inevitably become people who look down on the League of Nations too much. So I say that the two types of people are not good friends of the League of Nations. Since China is one of the member states, the Chinese people should understand the ability of the League of Nations and the limits of its ability. They should not expect too much, and they should not despise it and ignore it. At the same time, they should also study the method of using the League of Nations well. They should not abuse it, and they should not be used by it. This is the obligation that national diplomacy should have.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Federation Telegraphically Requested the League of Nations to Uphold Justice</h3>
<p>The district branches of the Citizens' Federation telegraphed to the League of Nations: "To all the delegation representatives of the League of Nations meeting in Paris, France, Japan launched an unprovoked war, dispatched troops to the Northeast, invaded and occupied Liaoning and Jilin provinces, proceeded to Heilongjiang province, disrupted Tianjin, and destroyed East Asian peace. Its acts of violence against the Kellogg-Briand Pact are known to the whole world. Right and wrong are obvious. All countries should act justly, uphold justice, and maintain the covenant. China is a civilized country, observing propriety and righteousness,恪遵public reason, and maintaining the covenant. It is listening to the League of Nations' sanctions. There is a resolution of the League of Nations limiting the withdrawal of Japanese troops, so that Japan will comply and hope that public reason will have a line of申张望. Unexpectedly, Japan is implementing its gunboat policy. Now it is变本加厉, and the battle of 黑省 is not over. Humiliating China is to insult all countries. Losing the credibility of the League of Nations means that no other country has disregarded the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact means destroying world peace. The Chinese nation will not die. It has the spirit of revolutionary struggle and will never allow power to prevail over public reason. Although Japan is狡 言巧辩, will the League of Nations insist on becoming a bubble? However, the people of all countries have obedience. If there is no public reason, the barbarians will act, and those who are unjust will鳴, which is what it should be. What a solemn thing it is for the countries to set up the League of Nations Council! If the world is fair, and Japan is one of the members of the League of Nations, how can it be so reckless and disregard public reason? I think the League of Nations should implement a non-bias 主义, decisively prevent Japan from 强权, give it to execution, maintain world peace, and maintain the League of Nations' credibility and justice. The world's beliefs are not only the Chinese people. I hope that countries will貫徹底坚持 and seriously express themselves in order to rectify the international system and make the world fair. Otherwise, the Chinese people, at any sacrifice, will not hesitate to be義 無反顧. The telegram is urgent. There is no馨 香 pray. This telegram is sent and I hope you will understand it. Shanghai Citizens' Federation, 7th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 19th, 26th, 29th and other 9 associations. Issued on November 18, 20th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Seventy-Eighth Division Commander Qu Shounian Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Nineteenth Route Army was ordered to arrive in the Nanjing-Shanghai area to undertake garrison duties, it was decided that the entire Seventy-Eighth Division would be stationed in Shanghai. Advance personnel arrived from Xunyang a few days ago to arrange everything. The commander of the Seventy-Eighth Division, Qu Shounian, also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the evening before last (the 17th) and arrived here at eight o'clock this morning to discuss the division's stationing locations with local Shanghai authorities. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed Commander Qu's aide, Mr. Yu, yesterday to inquire about various news items, and received the following answers:</p>
<p>The Garrison Commander Position Decided to Be Succeeded by Dai Ji: Regarding the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Commander issue, after Xiong Shihui completed the handover, the central government considered the Shanghai-Woosung defense to be of great importance and that a leader should not be lacking for even a day. Initially, Jiang Guangnai was considered to succeed him, but Jiang strongly declined. Subsequently, there was an order for the newly appointed Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Commander Chen Mingshu to temporarily hold the position concurrently. However, Chen also felt that although Nanjing and Shanghai were close, it was still difficult to provide adequate command due to the distance. Therefore, it was decided that Dai Ji, the chief of staff of the Nineteenth Route Army, would succeed him. Dai is now preparing to come to Shanghai within a few days. However, his assumption of office will take place after the Fourth Plenary Session concludes and Chen Mingshu assumes office as the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Commander.</p>
<p>The Seventy-Eighth Division Comes to Shanghai via Xunyang and Nanjing: After receiving the order to lead his troops to Shanghai for garrison duty, Qu Shounian, the commander of the Seventy-Eighth Division, immediately issued an order for the troops to assemble in Jiujiang to await transportation by ship to Nanjing. Without delay, they will proceed to Shanghai for garrison duty. Their stationing locations will be approximately as follows: the Second Regiment will be stationed in Zhabei and Jiangwan, which will be guarded by the division's special service battalion, and the remaining troops will be stationed in the Longhua Temple area.</p>
<p>Kunshan Garrison Troops Arrived Yesterday: Kunshan is located in a crucial area between Nanjing and Shanghai. Given the current national crisis, defense should be taken with particular care. Chen Mingshu has decided that the Sixtieth Division and the Sixty-First Supplementary Brigade of the Nineteenth Route Army will be responsible for the garrison. These troops arrived in Kunshan yesterday morning from Nanjing. With this tight arrangement, the security of Nanjing and Shanghai can be ensured.</p>

<h3>Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance Commemorates Compatriots Who Died in Internal Strife and Foreign Aggression</h3>
<p>The Women's National Salvation Grand Alliance issued a circular stating: "To Whom It May Concern: More than two months have passed since the invasion of the violent enemy. The people of the nation are in sorrow and stand idly by. The government's meetings are divided. Recently, Tianjin has fallen into a state of terror, and Shanghai, Woosung, and Wuhan are also under strict guard. However, all are holding to a policy of non-resistance. Nothing is sadder than the death of the heart. We are grieved by this. Therefore, we are initiating a Grand Commemoration Meeting for the compatriots who died in internal strife and foreign aggression, to be held at 3:00 PM on the 20th at the Association's premises on the fifth floor of the Women's Commercial Bank on Nanjing Road, to mourn the deceased and encourage the living. We earnestly request that your school/association appoint ten representatives to participate on time, present elegiac couplets, and express our condolences together. We eagerly await your participation. Please inform the police."</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>Letter Reported That Customs Brokers Are Forbidden to Load Goods on Japanese Ships: The Anti-Japanese Association previously received confidential reports that customs brokers were secretly loading goods onto Japanese ships. After investigation, it was found that there were many small customs brokers in Nanshi that were not members of the public association, making it impossible to take action against them for the time being. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Customs Brokers Association, stating: "Regarding the case of customs brokers secretly loading goods onto Japanese ships, which has been reported, after the Association dispatched the Investigation Department to investigate, the reply was received stating that the Zhen Da Customs Brokerage on Lao Yong'an Street claimed that they did load goods to Osaka previously, but not since September 15th. Upon reviewing the overseas shipping records, this was confirmed. An investigation was also conducted at the Fuxingheng Customs Brokerage in Chang Geng Lane on Avenue Edward VII, which claimed that they have not shipped any goods since the 22nd of last month. The medicinal materials and other items were indeed loaded at the Mitsubishi Wharf, and the customs declarations for these goods were handled by Japanese customs brokers. They requested that the Association take severe action. An inquiry was made with the Nanshi Customs Brokers Association, which stated that they could only forward a warning to each firm after receiving a letter from this Association. However, it seems that there is no way to deal with the small customs brokers who are not members of the public association, as they account for six out of ten. Therefore, it is reported that economic severance is the only way to save the nation, and it is the consensus of the entire nation. All customs brokers are citizens, yet they dare to disregard public opinion and continue to declare and load goods on Japanese ships, undermining the anti-Japanese movement. We do not know what their intentions are. We hereby request your Association to investigate and forward a warning to all colleagues that they must not declare and load goods on Japanese ships in the future. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be severely punished. This is addressed to the Customs Brokers Association."</p>
<p>Prohibition of Japanese Exclusive Films Being Shown in China: The Anti-Japanese Association issued its 16th public notice yesterday, stating: "It has been secretly reported that a large number of films exclusively owned by the Japanese Towa Trading Co. in China, such as 'The Blue Angel', 'The Last Squad', 'White Devil', 'A Trip to the Moon', 'Immortal Elves', 'Beauty Pass', 'A Dream Hard to Fulfill', 'Spiritual and Physical Conflict', 'Love at Sea', etc., will be successively screened in various theaters in Shanghai, and managed by Manager Luo of a certain film company. Ostensibly, they are using the name of the Chinese Wufa Film Company, but in reality, all the profits go to the Japanese. This is extremely hateful. At this time of national crisis, we are eager to contribute money to alleviate the difficulties, and we fear that it is not enough. How can we use the money to save the country to fill the pockets of our enemies? We hereby urgently notify all Chinese cinemas in the city not to screen the above-mentioned films. All Chinese with blood and spirit should not buy tickets to watch the above-mentioned films. We fear that this may not be widely known, so we hereby issue this notice."</p>
<h3>The Yidu Ship Was Completely Blown Up</h3>
<p>Four Deaths in the Engine Room</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Loss Valued at 500,000</p>
<p>Cause of the Disaster: The Yidu ship, owned by the American company Yangtze Rapids Steamship Co., operating on the Shanghai-Chongqing line, was carrying cargo from Shanghai to Chongqing. On the morning of the 17th of this month, when sailing to the Yangdu Bay area upstream of Fuzhou, the cylinder in the engine room suddenly exploded. The nearby oil storage ship was also damaged by the explosion, and gasoline flowed out and into the engine room. Once exposed to the heat, a tragic accident occurred with a loud explosion.</p>
<p>Crew Casualties: At the time, Chief Engineer Zhang Yueming, stokers, and others were working in the engine room. They were unable to escape in time and were all killed in the explosion. It has been reported that at least four people were killed in the engine room. The other injured firemen are still being investigated. After the accident, the ship sailed into a shallow area and grounded itself to facilitate rescue.</p>
<p>Passengers Rescued: The passengers inside the ship panicked and tried to escape, with more than 20 people jumping into the river. Fortunately, the river was shallow, preventing them from drowning. The shipowner urgently sent a telegram for help. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Emei ship was the first to receive the telegram and immediately sailed to the area, rescuing the passengers onto its ship and taking them to Chongqing. Therefore, there were no casualties among the passengers, which was fortunate amidst the misfortune.</p>
<p>Warship Assisted in Rescue: The American gunboat USS Tutuila, stationed upstream of Yichang, received the ship's distress call and immediately sailed to Yangdu Bay to assist in the rescue. All the captain, crew, and sailors were rescued by the warship. Two telegrams were sent yesterday reporting that rescue efforts were still underway.</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Completely Destroyed: The ship was fully loaded with over 200 pieces of textiles, over 400 bags of white sugar, and 700-800 pieces of miscellaneous goods from Shanghai. After the explosion, the entire ship caught fire. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received a telegram from the American warship stating that all the cargo on the ship had been completely burned and nothing remained.</p>
<p>Aftermath: A reporter visited the company yesterday to inquire. The person in charge replied that the hull could be salvaged, and the machinery, except for the boiler, could still be used. They would try to tow the ship back to Shanghai. The ship had a displacement of 600 tons and cost 300,000 taels to build. It was insured for 250,000 taels with the American Asia Insurance Company in Shanghai. Most of the cargo was insured. The passengers have been notified. The total loss is estimated to be over 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yuanshun Ship Hit a Reef and Then Collided with an American Warship</h3>
<p>Stranded on a Reef in Quanzhou: The Yuanshun ship, owned by the Yingkou Dalian Company and operating along the coast, loaded cargo from Niuzhuang to Fujian and was unloading in Quanzhou. On the morning of the 14th of this month, after unloading all the cargo from Quanzhou, it departed from the port. At 9:00 AM, the ship was near a hidden reef next to Xiaozhui Mountain at the mouth of Quanzhou (marked on the nautical chart as being six feet above low tide). The ship's owner, Japanese national Teiichi Kotani, was on duty. The Japanese national was not familiar with the route and mistakenly steered into the reef, causing it to run aground. The bottom of the ship was severely damaged by the reef.</p>
<p>Ship Damage: The bottom of the ship, from the first cabin to the second cabin, was breached for over 100 feet, with eight iron plates and dozens of transverse ribs damaged. Fortunately, the bottom of the ship was double-layered, preventing it from sinking. However, the loss is estimated to be at least 30,000 yuan. Later, at high tide, it managed to reverse out of danger and ventured to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<p>Damaged an American Warship: Yesterday, the ship arrived at the Jiangnan Shipyard at the entrance of Shanghai for repairs. Unexpectedly, when entering the dock, it veered and collided with an American warship parked on the riverside, causing significant damage to the warship's hull. Yesterday, the captain of the warship reported to the harbor master. After verifying the extent of the damage, a negotiation will be initiated, and Dalian will be asked for compensation.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Yesterday Urged the Great Eastern Workers to Resume Work</h3>
<p>After the strike of all employees of the Great Eastern Book Company's head office in this city, the party and government authorities jointly issued a notice to stop it, but the employees insisted on continuing the strike because the treatment conditions were not resolved. The Social Bureau summoned the trade union for questioning yesterday. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Authorities Advise: In addition to strictly ordering the workers to immediately resume work and quietly await investigation and verification, the Municipal Social Bureau summoned the Publishing Industry Union for questioning at 2 p.m. yesterday. The union sent Director Wang Yongliang to attend. It was reported that Wang Bing of the Social Bureau advised that during this time of national crisis, labor and management should quickly seek coordination and no further disputes should occur. He asked that the workers be instructed to resume work immediately, and that the treatment conditions be quietly awaited for party and government authorities to mediate according to law.</p>
<p>Police Attitude: After receiving a report that the workers of the Great Eastern Book Company had gone on strike, the Political Department of the Public Concession Public Bureau sent personnel to investigate the truth and summoned Yang Mingqiu, the representative of the Great Eastern Branch Office of the Publishing Industry Union, for questioning at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. Each was instructed to inform the workers that they should maintain order during the strike. If no accidents occur, the Public Bureau will not interfere. Otherwise, for the sake of local security, the Public Bureau will have no choice but to stop them.</p>
<h3>Issue of Arms Found on a Shipping Vessel</h3>
<p>Headquarters Ordered That Those Unrelated to the Ship Not Be Detained</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association previously reported that troops stationed along the Yangtze River would often detain ships without permission on the pretext of searching passengers for concealed weapons, preventing them from sailing. Although the shipping bureaus in various places negotiated on reasonable grounds, they rarely succeeded, hindering transportation significantly. Therefore, a special report was submitted to the Ministry, asking it to instruct troops stationed in various places that, if weapons were found on ships, ships should not be detained without permission unless the ship's crew was involved, in order to maintain the shipping industry. It is now learned that the Shipping Association received instructions from the Ministry yesterday, stating: "The report regarding the troops stationed along the river not being allowed to detain shipping vessels without permission has been noted. In addition to the Ministry sending a general letter to the troops stationed along the river to inform them of this matter, General Commander Chiang has also approved an order instructing the troops stationed along the river that, in the future, if passengers are found to have concealed weapons on ships, ships should not be detained if the ship is not involved, in order to maintain the shipping industry. You are hereby informed of this order."</p>
<h3>Second Call for Land Reclamation in the Downtown Area</h3>
<p>Registration Deadline Set for the 25th</p>
<p>The second call for land reclamation in the downtown area began on the 11th of this month. The designated land covers over 300 mu. Due to the impact of the current situation, registration has not been very enthusiastic. So far, only about 60 mu has been claimed. According to the Land Bureau, the registration deadline is set for the 25th of this month. Rumors that the registration deadline is the 15th are incorrect. Those who wish to obtain land in this area can register before the 25th.</p>
<h3>Instructions to Spread Out the Repayment of Borrowed Grain</h3>
<p>The winter grain borrowed in Jiangsu Province is 4.5 yuan per shi. It was previously ordered to be repaid in five years, starting in the 19th year of the Republic. Later, the provincial authorities ordered a postponement. Therefore, the first and fifth districts of Shanghai County submitted a report to the county government, requesting that the authorities consider the people's difficulties and withdraw the postponement order. It is now learned that District One of the county has received instructions from the county government, stating that the autumn harvest in various rural areas this year is poor, and the farmers' livelihoods are difficult, which is indeed the case. The Jiangsu Department of Finance will be requested to review the situation and issue instructions. District Chief Wu immediately instructed the township heads to inform everyone.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Grand Alliance Will Host Guests from All Walks of Life Today</h3>
<p>Reporting on Association Affairs and Its Mission</p>
<p>The National Goods Promotion Grand Alliance Committee has resolved to concentrate anti-Japanese forces and continue to work harder since the representatives of the four national goods groups and factories decided to hold a meeting. It has been more than a month since then and it has made significant achievements and has received deep sympathy from national goods circles. The Association will host guests from all walks of life at the China United Apartments on Beijing Road this evening (the 19th) at 6 p.m. to connect emotions and unite in anti-Japanese efforts and report on association affairs and important missions.</p>
<h3>Crisis in the Future of China's Egg Industry</h3>
<p>American Fresh Eggs Are Being Imported</p>
<p>China has always been known for its agricultural products. However, in recent years, the government has paid too little attention to research and improvement, and it has been declining. The increasing population and quantity of rice and wheat, and the declining foreign trade in silk and tea, are all significant indicators. Fresh eggs have also been a major export of our country. Recently, a surprising message was received that a major company in Hong Kong imported 100 dozen good fresh eggs from the United States in August of this year. Each dozen was sold for HK$1.60, and the goods were sold out within one day of arrival. 1,000 dozen were purchased and sold out. In the future, they will continue to order from the United States. Although there are a few new-style chicken farms in Shanghai, they are all too small in scope to meet this major request. This alone shows the urgent need for agricultural improvement. The improvement must not only be in quantity, but also in quality. In this time of national crisis and the promotion of national goods, this kind of news deserves serious attention from the government and society. We must act quickly.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Harbor Quarantine Office to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Regarding the Inland River Shipping Industry's Opposition to Ship Double Disinfection</p>
<p>The Harbor Quarantine Office has replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in response to some misunderstandings regarding the inner harbor shipping industry's ship disinfection, stating: "Regarding your letter No. 208 dated the 11th of this month, stating that the National Harbor Quarantine Office is forcibly charging fees, which is unprecedented, and that the voyage is very short, making disinfection unnecessary, and requesting that the Chamber forward this to the Social Bureau to stop it, and stating that the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association member, Xiexing Shipping Bureau, reported that the Quarantine Office has been forcing them to pay fees in recent days, etc., the Chamber has sent a cable to the Ministry and requested free processing. This office is responsible for quarantine, directly responsible for the health of the people in the port, and indirectly responsible for international health missions. We have repeatedly explained this and sent notices and quarantine and disinfection regulations for you to forward. However, the Inland River Shipping Industry Association considers the execution of official duties to be forced charging, and considers the important administration related to international health to be unprecedented. This is an undeniable misidentification. As for the claim that the voyage is very short and that there have never been epidemics, making disinfection and prevention unnecessary, if an epidemic were to break out, it would be too late to remedy it. The current situation in provinces such as Shanxi and Shaanxi can serve as a warning. As for the request to forward this to the Social Bureau to stop it, it shows a lack of understanding of the organization of administrative organs. It is no wonder that there is a misidentification and a lack of understanding of the facts. Furthermore, the Xiexing Shipping Bureau and other companies in the same industry, such as Lixing, Gongmao, etc., have already signed contracts for ship disinfection. Therefore, resisting health administration and disregarding human morality is one matter, and violating the contract is another matter. The Inner Harbor Ship Double Disinfection Regulations were promulgated and implemented on July 27 of this year. Later, because the regulations were not exhaustive, they were approved for modification and re-promulgated on September 20. The fee for ship disinfection cannot be compared to national or local taxes. This office needs to use a lot of medicines for ship fumigation and disinfection. The minor public fee paid once every six months by shipowners for the right to disinfection and hygiene is also a reasonable obligation that they should fulfill. The funds allocated by the Customs Office are the operating expenses allocated to this office by the state. The request for free disinfection is like asking a clever woman to cook without rice. In addition to awaiting instructions from the Ministry, Article 6 of the Inner Harbor Ship Double Disinfection Regulations states that 'this Quarantine Office may provide free medical consultation to shipowners in the port who have minor illnesses or injuries. In addition, this office has a well-equipped epidemic prevention hospital. If any epidemic victims are discovered, they may be sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.' This office is not just collecting fees without doing practical things. We are afraid that the outside world does not understand, so we are including this information. We hope that your association will assist in national administration, and that you will carefully explain and guide the preparations of the masses. This will be very beneficial to the future of humanity and hygiene. The reason for the letter is as above. Please review it. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, November 18."</p>

At Gordon Road, one thief was apprehended. Seeing this, the other thieves fired a shot, but fortunately, the bullet did not hit. As a result, one thief was still apprehended and taken to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Various Unions Severely Reprimand the Three Lawyers in the You An Case</h3>
<p>The Shanghai city-wide unions sent a letter to the Lawyers' Association to request a decisive punishment for the three lawyers who defended You Bolu, namely Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen. The letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern: The thief You Bolu, during his tenure as the head of the Fifth District of the former Public Security Bureau, slaughtered patriotic people and sabotaged the patriotic movement. Everyone who has morals hates him. However, Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen dared to ignore their conscience and defend the thief You in court. This is no different from directly helping the wicked. According to our Postal Workers' Union, they sent a letter to your association requesting corrective action, but they failed to repent and instead quibbled. Judging by their intentions, it is unknown where their national position is, or where their qualifications as citizens lie. We are all outraged and recognize Zhang Yaozeng and others as major thieves of the state and scum of society. We request that your association decisively punish them in accordance with the resolutions. We vow to lead more than 800,000 workers in the city not to cooperate with them. This letter is for your information, and we hope you will handle it seriously and reply to us. Sincerely, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Postal Employees' Union, Publishing Industry Union, B District Water and Electricity Industry Union, Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, and over 80 other unions."</p>
<h3>Japanese National Detained for Illegally Carrying Weapons</h3>
<p>One day, Sunday, afternoon, an Indian constable on Broadway Road saw a Japanese national heading to the central district in a rickshaw, and his behavior was suspicious.

<h3>Wang Yifei Angered by Japan, Attempts Suicide by Jumping into the Huangpu River and Is Rescued</h3>
<p>At around 10 p.m. the night before last, a young man at the Tenth Wharf outside Maojia Lane, Dadongmen, Nanshi, jumped into the Huangpu River unnoticed, attempting suicide. Hu Yucheng, a guard at the first post, spotted him and rushed to call for help from nearby boatmen. They managed to rescue the young man. He was taken to the first district's general office across the river for preliminary questioning. He stated that his name was Wang Yifei, 18 years old, from Ningbo. He had been working as a small accountant in a Japanese household in Qingdao. After the outrageous Japanese occupied our country's eastern provinces, the news spread, and because I am also a citizen of the Republic of China, I should naturally fulfill my responsibilities as a citizen. Therefore, I resigned from my job. After leaving, I took a ship to Shanghai to look for old friends and find a new place to live. Unexpectedly, my fate was unfortunate. After many days of searching, I could not find a place to settle down. In addition, I learned from the newspapers every day that the hateful and barbaric Japanese were invading our country more and more. Therefore, I was extremely frustrated. I thought that living in this turbid world was meaningless. That is why I came here today to commit suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River, in order to end my miserable life and hopefully awaken my countrymen to rise up and resist Japan. It was ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement.</p>
<h3>Case of Watchman-Police Beating a Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>Released on a Fifty Yuan Good Behavior Bond</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that two men, Sa Huaxin and Meng Geerxin, watchman-police employed by the New Kang Land Company, were accused of beating a rickshaw puller on Central Road last Tuesday. After several days of trial in the British Police Court, a verdict was reached this morning. The verdict made an important statement regarding the status of watchman-police, declaring that neither the regulations of the Foreign Concessions nor the police regulations of the Municipal Council stipulate that watchman-police employed by private entities possess greater authority than ordinary private citizens. Therefore, Sa Huaxin was found guilty of ordinary battery and was released on a fifty-yuan good behavior bond. Meng Geerxin was acquitted leniently due to insufficient evidence.</p>

<h3>Xu Lingyun Sues to Be Relieved of Responsibility for Guaranteeing Loans</h3>
<p>Ai Jianming States He Should Bear Joint Responsibility</p>
<p>Xu Lingyun, a prominent silk merchant in this city, organized the Yifengxiang Silk Firm in 1929, located on Taiwan Road (inside Xu's residence). Xu held three shares, Huang Jinchen held three shares, Ai Jianming held three shares, and a Mr. Chen held one share. At that time, Ai Jianming was elected as manager, and Xu Lingyun and Huang Jinchen were the resident shareholder representatives, so that the assistant manager could consult with them on matters nearby. Last year, shareholder representative Huang Jinchen handled the silk factory's mortgage loan, amounting to over 700,000 yuan from Dingyuan. Later, because the price of silk fell daily, Huang Jinchen died this spring. At the end of last year, the amount of money exchanged with various banks was as high as 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. In order to maintain credit, the firm had Xu Lingyun and Ai Jianming jointly guarantee the loan and repeatedly extend the term. When the term was about to expire at the end of October this year, Xu Lingyun was afraid that the banks would press for payment and he would have no excuse to give, so he sued Ai Jianming in the Shanghai District Court at the beginning of last month, demanding to be relieved of the guarantee responsibility, on the grounds that Ai Jianming induced him to act as guarantor (because Ai Jianming lives in the Chinese district). Yesterday, the court summoned the defendant, Ai Jianming, who did not appear, and appointed lawyer Chen Wenzhao to appear on his behalf, stating that the defendant and the plaintiff have the same shares in the case, and the guarantee responsibility is also the same. The powers of the manager and the shareholder's resident representative, as well as the horse fees, etc., are all the same. Moreover, the silk factory's mortgage loan was handled by Huang Jinchen. The plaintiff lives in the firm day and night, so how could he not know about the exchange of money with the banks, etc. After debating with the plaintiff's lawyer, he stated to the court that the plaintiff, Xu Lingyun, had recently filed a criminal breach of trust lawsuit in the First Special District Court. The same facts should not be accused in different ways. If a criminal offense occurs, it can be reported in the civil court, etc. Judge Fan of the trial ordered that the hearing be adjourned and that witnesses be summoned again and other shareholders be notified to participate.</p>
<h3>Over Two Hundred Gold Yuan Stolen from a Brothel</h3>
<p>Ninth Sister, Lao Jiu, Feared Being Punished</p>
<p>Although Did Not Steal, Willing to Compensate</p>
<p>Result: Fine of Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>Cheng Jiudi, the owner of the brothel at No. 700 Small Garden, Zhejiang Road, whose original name is Cheng Jiudi, discovered on the 14th of this month that more than two hundred silver dollars placed in the kitchen had disappeared. Later, a tin box containing banknotes was found under the sofa in the room. Upon opening it, it was empty. He then reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, who ordered detective Zhu Shanghe to conduct a review. It was learned that the stolen banknotes were undoubtedly stolen by someone inside, because Cheng Jiudi placed the banknotes very secretly, and outsiders would not know. The people in the brothel were summoned to the police station for questioning one by one. At that time, the prostitute Ninth Sister, Lao Jiu (original name Qian Suzhen, from Pudong, 19 years old) suddenly claimed that although she did not steal the money, she was willing to compensate the full amount. Suspecting her suspicious behavior, she was immediately detained. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Simple Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted her for theft under Article 337 of the Criminal Code. Then, Cheng Jiudi submitted a petition stating the previous situation, and claimed that many people enter and exit his room, so it is impossible to determine whether the money was stolen by Qian Suzhen, but her usual behavior is quite good, etc. When questioned, Qian Suzhen said that she did not actually steal the money. When she was at the police station, she said that she was willing to compensate because she was afraid of being beaten by the foreign detectives, and asked for understanding. She also retained lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend her. Judge Jiang Gongliang reviewed the confession and sentenced Qian Zhen to a fine of thirty yuan in court.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit for Check Not Being Paid in Cash</h3>
<p>When the Zhihe Yongji Bank closed down, it issued a large number of high-value checks. The payees, unable to cash them, filed lawsuits one after another. Madie, the manager of the British firm Wanlai Foreign Firm, also received a check from the bank for 50,000 taels of silver. The origin of the check was the payment from Shen Chengfu, a comprador of the Taihe Foreign Firm, for Madie's purchase of cotton, due on August 28. However, on August 19, the Zhihe Bank closed down. Madie claimed that Shen Yingxiang, the father of Shen Chengfu, was the manager of the Zhihe Bank, which was clearly a conspiracy to defraud property. He then retained lawyer Wu Linkun to file a criminal self-prosecution against Shen Yingxiang and Shen Chengfu, father and son, in the First Special Court. However, Shen Chengfu had already fled without a trace. Yesterday afternoon, when the court summoned Shen Yingxiang for trial, he claimed that he had been in contact with Taihe Foreign Firm. Shen Chengfu used to issue checks, and he would always deliver the silver on time. At the beginning of August, he issued a large number of checks, but he did not deliver the silver, causing Zhihe to have insufficient funds and be forced to close down. There was no collusion. Lawyer Wu then requested an investigation of the accounts. Judge Jiang then ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. Shen Yingxiang was required to provide a shopkeeper's guarantee that he would be available when summoned.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongyao Flees After Deceiving Goods</h3>
<p>Creditors' Group Has Filed a Lawsuit According to Law</p>
<p>Zheng Honghui, the owner and manager of Zheng Yiji Chaozhou Office in Shanghai on Taiwan Road in the French Concession, under the pretext of procuring goods, defrauded more than 20 fruit wholesalers in Nanshi Sixteen Pups of fruit worth over 10,000 gold yuan. He also used the same trick to defraud a huge amount of goods from various candy, groceries, and foreign goods shops, all paid with post-dated bad checks from a certain bank. Before the checks were due, Zheng took his family and fled without a trace, leaving only goods that had not been shipped out in the shop (namely small fruit candies), worth about 20 gold yuan. When the check holders went to cash the checks upon maturity, they learned that the owner had gone bankrupt and fled. They immediately formed a creditors' group and hired lawyer Zhou Xiao'an. Yesterday, they gathered all the creditors to discuss how to recover the debts. The candy and grocery creditors had already joined. Yesterday, they first filed a request with the Second District Court of the Special District for a provisional attachment order to be executed quickly, so as to avoid the remaining goods being delayed and rotting, and to protect the capital of the creditors.</p>
<h3>Refugees Freeze to Death in the Alley</h3>
<p>In an alley on Linping Road in Hongzhen, north of Shanghai, there are Jiangbei refugees living in the open. As the weather gets colder, they lack clothing and food, and many are freezing and starving and becoming ill. Yesterday, a refugee died in the alley. He was about fifty years old and was still wearing a tattered blue cloth short shirt and trousers. He was as thin as a stick. After being informed, the Fourth Division of the Fifth District ordered the local bailiff to report it to the District Court for an inquest.

<h3>The Ferocity of the Murderous Thugs</h3>
<p>Claimed to Be From Little Ningbo Before Leaving</p>
<p>The Mediator Was Slapped in the Face</p>
<p>Wang Aqiao, also known as Weng Ajiao, a 22-year-old from Ningbo who worked as a cargo caller, recently became acquainted with Zhang Laoqi, a former prostitute from Suzhou. Zhang had a smoking addiction. The night before last, Wang and his uncle accompanied Zhang to Yan Boying's Suzhou-style room at No. 10 Yuqing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, to indulge. At 8:45 PM, more than ten enemies suddenly rushed in, each wielding sharp weapons. A man wearing a black serge gown and a copper basin hat, speaking in the local dialect, led the group. The rest were dressed in blue cloth short coats and long clothes. The leader entered the room and called out for Ajiao. Wang, who was lying on the opium bed, thought it was a friend and got up to greet him. The leader pointed a pistol at Wang and ordered him to take off his coat. As soon as Wang took off his coat, the leader's accomplices took out sharp axes and hacked at Wang's shoulders, back, hands, and feet, inflicting more than ten axe wounds. Wang fell to the ground. While the attack was taking place, the assailants guarded the stairs and the door, preventing anyone from entering or leaving. They said to the bystanders, "Go away, this is none of your business." Yan Boying pleaded with the thugs, but was slapped in the face. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a chaotic rush. Before leaving, they shouted loudly, "I am from Little Ningbo, see where I am!" After the assailants left, Wang's uncle and concubine hired a car to take Wang to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yan Boying reported the incident to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate the scene and arrest the murderers. However, Wang died in the hospital at 4:45 AM yesterday due to his severe injuries. Wang's uncle and concubine had already left the hospital, so the hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall, the morgue. Because the body could not be identified, the Second Special Court was notified. Prosecutor Ding Shikui, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Jiang Qu, and clerk Peng Xu, arrived at the scene at 10:00 AM. After examining the body, they sat at the public table. The patrol reported the previous situation, and witness Yan Boying testified about the circumstances of the deceased being hacked. Mr. Ding announced that the deceased Wang Aqiao had died from axe wounds inflicted during his life. If the deceased's relatives come to claim the body for burial, they will be allowed to do so; otherwise, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall will arrange for the burial. After the examination, at 11:00 AM, the deceased's concubine, Zhang Laoqi, finally found the deceased's mother, Weng Zhang, and brought her to the hall to sign a guarantee to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Yan Jinbiao Disagrees With Death Sentence</h3>
<p>Appeal Case Scheduled for Pronouncement</p>
<p>Yan Jinbiao, also known as Yan Er, from Funing, Jiangbei, previously organized a gang to commit three robberies in the French Concession and opened fire in the Fashang Hotel, killing three people. Afterwards, he was arrested by the French police and sent to the Second Special Court. After the trial, Yan was found guilty of robbery and murder and sentenced to death. Because Yan did not agree with the initial trial, he hired a lawyer and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Dezhang, along with Associate Judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Changnian, and Chief Prosecutor Peng Wangxin, sat in the Second Criminal Court to question him. Yan Jinbiao stated that he was 31 years old and from Funing. When asked if he had committed any crimes before, he replied that he had been framed and sentenced to nine months in prison in the British Concession court in February 1929. When asked if he was also known as Yan Jinbiao, he replied that he had changed his name to Yan Dongbo. When asked if he had committed three robberies with the fugitive Shi Renwen and others, and committed murder with Yang Jiucheng, Li Guoren and others in the hotel, he replied that he was really wronged. He had been a military messenger in Xuzhou in 1928 and came to Shanghai in 1929. He was arrested in the British Concession, and he dared not steal, let alone commit murder. When asked why he confessed everything in the first trial, he replied that he had been coerced into confessing in the police station in the first trial. When asked if he admitted to participating in the robbery in the first trial and if stolen goods and two pawn tickets from the victim's house were found at his place and identified by the victim, he replied that his brother-in-law, Feng Damin, and his wife Zhang's lover were both robbers, and the pawn tickets belonged to Feng Da and were not obtained by him through robbery. When asked if he confessed in the first trial that he, Li Guoren, and Yang Jiucheng conspired to rob a pawnshop on Chongqing Road in the Chunjiang Hotel, fearing that Jiang Zhonghan, Xia Rongsheng, and a Mr. Xue would report them, so they first shot them to death and then went to rob the pawnshop, and that after the agreement, they went to the Fashang Hotel, where he fired three shots first and the rest were fired by Li and others, he replied that Li Guoren said to Yang Jiucheng while eating at his concubine's house in August that his brother had been murdered and that he wanted to call Yang Jiucheng and him to take revenge, but he did not go. At this point, Chief Prosecutor Peng stood up to make his arguments, stating that the appellant Yan Jinbiao's three counts of breaking into people's houses to rob and committing murder had been thoroughly investigated in the first trial, and there were records to prove it. Now the appellant has suddenly recanted his confession, but has not presented any concrete evidence to the contrary, and his statements are all empty words and difficult to believe. He asked for a judgment according to the law. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi said that the appellant was questioned several times in the first trial and had always admitted his guilt. His lawyer believed that the judgment of the first trial was very legal and requested that the appeal be dismissed and the original judgment be upheld. After the appellant's lawyer made his defense, Judge Guo announced the end of the debate and said that the judgment would be announced on a scheduled date.</p>

Zheng Zhuoen used to work as a carpenter at the Jiangnan Shipyard but had quit and now worked as a carpenter at the Wanneng Machine Factory at No. 164 Baotong Road, Hongkou. Due to inconvenient transportation, he lived separately from his mother, Deng Zheng. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM yesterday, Deng Zheng was assassinated at home by someone who broke in and hacked the old woman's head six times with an axe. One axe wound below her ear and on her neck was fatal, causing her to fall to the ground and die instantly. Afterwards, Lin Yuan, a 29-year-old Cantonese who lives at No. 24, Lane 41, Jiangbian Road, Gaochang Temple, who makes a living as a tailor and is now a gambler, reported to the police officer on duty that Deng Zheng had been hacked to death. The police officer on duty brought the reporter to the Gaochang Temple Police Station in the Second District for custody. At the same time, police were sent to investigate the deceased's home. According to the deceased's eldest grandson, Zhi Di, Lin Yuan was the perpetrator. The fourth daughter of the woman also said that a few days ago, Lin Yuan came with an axe, pretending to borrow an awl, but did not dare to act because there were many people present. The police station, suspecting Lin Yuan, detained him and sent him to the Second District Headquarters, while reporting to the District Court. At 3:00 PM, the court sent a prosecutor to conduct an autopsy, confirming that she had been assassinated and had six axe wounds to the head, with one to the neck being fatal. A coroner's report was filled out, and the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. The suspected perpetrator, Lin Yuan, who was sent by the Second District, will be thoroughly investigated upon his arrival.</p>

<p>Fine of One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Jin Fusheng, a local, had been working as an accountant at the Continental and Liwei Automobile Company at No. 694 Jing'an Temple Road for four years. Recently, the company's manager, a foreigner named Ma Xu, discovered that Jin had privately collected 1,011.5 yuan in account fees and 280.65 taels of silver from the Office of the Financial Advisor of the Ministry of Finance between March and July of this year and had used them privately. He reported it to the Xinzha Police Station the day before yesterday, and Chinese detective Shao Jingfan and foreign detective Yi Wenen were dispatched to arrest Jin and bring him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the facts of the case, and the company's representative, a foreigner, complained about the defendant's private collection of account fees, but because the defendant had been employed for four years and was usually very honest, he requested a lenient sentence. When questioned, the defendant admitted to the charges. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confession and sentenced Jin Fusheng to a fine of one hundred yuan for a crime of handling affairs for others, intending to obtain illegal benefits for himself and violating his duties, causing damage to the property of the principal. If the fine is commuted to imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day.</p>

<p>Huashang Lvying Pharmacy at No. 24 Huangpu Beach, opened by Shanghai merchant Mao Heyuan, has been in business for more than ten years. The pharmacy directly manages famous European and American factories and specializes in various chemical materials for leather making. Recently, Mr. Mao, the owner of the pharmacy, has expanded his business due to the rapid development of various industries in the country.

<h3>Pushan Hospital Has Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>Pushan Villa, which is separated by the Pushan Obstetrics Hospital in Zhabei, also conducts daily medical treatment and medicine distribution, which has been a benefit for many years, benefiting the poor and sick. Recently, with the rising cost of living, the poor and sick are unable to afford medical treatment and go to the hospital for treatment. From January to October of this year, a total of more than 42,000 medical treatments and medicine distributions were conducted. The director of the hospital, Mr. Shi Yixuan, has scientific equipment and medicine, and the layout is well organized. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, Mr. Xu Deliang and others are invited to teach English and various nursing courses to nurses free of charge, in order to train specialized talents who will benefit society in the future. However, the hospital is entirely a charity, and the annual expenses depend entirely on donations from philanthropists from all walks of life, which is very stretched. It is hoped that kind-hearted gentlemen will enthusiastically donate to help, so that the hospital's good deeds can be maintained.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute at Daoda Baoshu Two Lanes, Aiwunyi Road</h3>
<p>Residents and shopkeepers of Daoda Baoshu Two Lanes on Aiwunyi Road received notices from the landlord to renovate and were required to move out before January 10th. The residents and shopkeepers felt that at this time of national crisis, with the situation serious, all industries depressed, and society uneasy, the landlord's action was not only disregarding the overall situation but also coming right before the New Year, which would certainly cause great losses and was difficult to bear. Yesterday, all the tenants held a meeting and decided to send several representatives to the landlord's place this afternoon to express their views.</p>

However, those who have been treated by him have all been cured with medicine. Seeing that the number of patients seeking treatment has been increasing recently, and that the lack of fixed consultation hours has caused patients to travel back and forth in vain, Dr. Zhuang has decided to set his consultation hours from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM for outpatient visits and 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM for house calls, starting from today. No appointments will be made after these hours, and the consultation fee is at the patient's discretion. Poor patients can be sent for consultation. The clinic is located at 357 Weihaiwei Road.</p>

<h3>News from the Municipal Joint District Branches</h3>
<p>Seventeenth District: The Seventeenth District Branch of the Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday issued a solicitation for contributions to reward Chairman Ma's isolated army in Heilongjiang for resisting Japan, stating: "For the past twenty years in our country, the army that punishes the people and executes the crimes has been seen many times, and the articles denouncing and reforming the government have been commonplace. Upon examination of the reasons for this, it is found that brothers are fighting each other, and family members are killing each other. You rise up and I fall, using violence to replace violence, only creating a scene of wailing everywhere and people living in poverty, which has been the case for more than a day. Now, the violent Japanese have invaded and forcibly occupied the three provinces. The officials in power, on the other hand, are silent and unknown. They do not resist when the soldiers are under the city, and they do not ask when the blood is dyed on the necks of the people. Where is the majesty of punishing crimes and denouncing them in the past? The only one who can consider the crying of Qin Ting and ask for help for the people is Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province alone. It is heard that Lord Ma's isolated army is fighting bravely against the savage soldiers in Heilongjiang, fighting thousands of miles, vowing to die to wash away the humiliation. All of our compatriots should spare no effort to reward the saviors who are fighting for national glory and loving the country, which is also a way to follow the ancient people's virtue of offering food and drink. Therefore, this branch has resolved to carry out reward work through regular meetings, and has requested the Bank of China in this district to directly remit money to Heilongjiang Province, without charging remittance fees, to show its enthusiasm. Moreover, Comrade Hua Xin Timber Industry of this association was the first to donate two hundred foreign dollars for remittance. The patriotic enthusiasm of your office has long been well-known. We hope that you will actively donate, send it directly to the Bank of China, remit it immediately after delivery, and there will be receipts from the bank as proof. Please do not take it lightly. This is the announcement of the Seventeenth District Branch of the Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai."</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>What is a Practical and Effective Way to Boycott Japanese Goods?</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hongsheng</p>
<p>Relying solely on a few people to shout and run around to boycott Japanese goods cannot popularize it everywhere, nor can it be permanently effective. To seek practical and universal methods, there must be a permanent organization that works to promote and research in the consumer markets everywhere, so that the general public will voluntarily not buy enemy goods. Over time, enemy goods will disappear from our market. The following plan is proposed: (1) Chambers of Commerce in various parts of the country should establish commodity research institutes (where there are no chambers of commerce, they can also be established by relevant agencies). The tasks are roughly as follows: (1) Identify the country of origin of commodities (2) Study the quality of commodities (3) Investigate the sales channels of commodities (4) Study the methods of replacing commodities with domestic goods (5) Introduce domestic goods. It is best for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to take the lead in initiating the above-mentioned research institute, formulating regulations, and sending circulars to chambers of commerce in various places to establish them uniformly. (2) Conduct a commodity survey. After the research institute is established, it will immediately conduct a commodity survey. In order to achieve the purpose of the task, an example of the survey form is as follows:</p>
<p>Commodity Name Brand Manufacturer Identification Method Advantages and Disadvantages Price Sales Remarks</p>
<p>Monosodium glutamate Fo Shou China Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory There is a word invented by Wu Yun Chu The taste is fresh, clean, pure, and vegetarian Medium-sized bottle, 48 cents</p>
<p>Ajinomoto Japan Suzuki Store Both bottled and canned have oriental characters The same purpose, the price is more expensive due to the gold exchange rate</p>
<p>Matches Phoenix Sweden Not damp Copper four pieces</p>
<p>Matches Beauty China Greater China Company More stems, more durable Copper three pieces</p>
<p>The above table is filled in based on what I remember. In addition, such as the camel hair velour made by Jintian Xiang Textile Factory recently, and the invention of the National Goods Raw Material Research Association, which has the same sauce color as Japanese goods, can all be used as research materials for promoting domestic goods. If the Chambers of Commerce in Tianjin, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Wuhan conduct a clear investigation by category first and issue it to various places for reference, then various places only need to fill in the forms in the same way or selectively re-check them once and post them on the doors of various stores for people to view. (3) Commodity labels. All stores that display various commodities must mark the country of origin with labels. This label can be made by the research institute based on the quality of the commodities, charged at cost, and distributed for application. With such a clear investigation, stores will not dare to openly sell enemy goods, nor will they dare to muddle through and pass off enemy goods as domestic goods or goods from other countries. The general public will also be aware of the quality of the goods, whether there are domestic goods to replace them, and know what to choose when buying. The matter is easy to do and the effect is sure to be great. In addition, publicizing and lecturing to the civilian teams at any time will also help the progress of this matter.</p>
<h3>Reply from Good-Hearted Zi Jun (Omitted)</h3>
<p>(Reply) Your letter discusses "At this time when the violent Japanese are rampant and the situation is urgent, enemy goods should not be allowed to be sold hastily." This is a very insightful point of view. Please also refer to the article "It's Not Difficult to Boycott Japanese Goods" by Mr. Xia, which was specially published in the fourth edition of the Shen Bao on November 16, 17, 18, and 19. It discusses the matter in great detail and can be used as a reference for you. Respectfully reply.</p>
<h3>Postal Stamps</h3>
<p>Affix this stamp when communicating, along with the corresponding amount of postage.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's newspaper reported a news item about Wang A'qiao from Ningbo being砍伤 by thugs. It was said that Wang's lover, Zhang Laoqi, had an affair with Wang Lao Wu, a detective in the Public Concession patrol. Wang A'qiao's victimization had some clues pointing to Wang Lao Wu. According to an investigation, this does not match the facts and is corrected accordingly. Also, the telegram from the Women's National Salvation Great Alliance to important figures in the women's world said "Ming has Shen Yunying," and "Ming" was mistaken for "Qing," which is corrected accordingly.</p>
<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I read a news item in today's newspaper about the strike of the employees of the Datong Bookstore, and it was said that a precondition has been put forward, etc. This does not match the facts. Our association has not put forward a precondition. The so-called precondition in your newspaper is the condition of the final concession requested by the trade union office and the company before the strike. However, the company still could not understand at that time and had no sincerity to accept it, which aroused the public anger of all the employees and led to a strike by all of them. The strikers this time include all the workers in the printing press, letterpress department, color printing department, type casting department, Chinese and Western typesetting department, photogravure department, valuable securities letterpress department, copper mold department, etc. The officials who have joined the association in the General Affairs Department, Publishing Department, Promotion Department, Branch Office Affairs Department, Accounting Department, Warehouse Department, Proofreading Department, and Editorial Department are currently working in the company only a small part of the officials who have not joined the association. I would like to ask you to correct this. Sincerely, Datong Bookstore Branch Office of the Publishing Industry Trade Union, November 18.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read a news item in your newspaper's local news section on the 13th about the private establishment of a poem riddle gambling platform in Minhang Min Garden. This does not match the facts. This garden has been established as a public entertainment venue for more than ten years. Whether it performs obscene flower drum opera is self-evident. The poem riddles are a matter of literary elegance. It is a matter of reputation and should be communicated to request your newspaper to make corrections in order to show the facts. With great gratitude, Minhang Min Garden, November 18.</p>

<h3>Memoirs of Dailiang</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>The Treaty of Shimonoseki was concluded, and Taiwan was ceded. Public opinion generally blamed Li Hongzhang, the minister who negotiated the peace. In fact, Japan originally intended to acquire the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Li insisted on not agreeing, so those who ceded Taiwan had to think of the next best thing. At that time, the Japanese people all blamed Ito Hirobumi for not getting the eastern provinces, and some even threatened to see him with knives. When the treaty was signed, Li knew that there would be resistance among the Taiwanese, so he sent his son Jingfang to hand over the territory. The Taiwanese people protested loudly and elected Governor Tang Jingsong as President, and Liu Yongfu as commander-in-chief, and raised troops to resist. The Japanese army advanced by land and sea. Liu held Taipei and lured the enemy in deep, ambushing them from all sides and annihilating countless enemies. Liu used his 3,000 Black Flag soldiers to fight north and south of Taiwan, fighting bitterly for three months. When the ammunition and rations were exhausted, he raised the white flag and surrendered. The Japanese army believed it to be true and sent marines to land and take over. With a thunderous sound, the landmine exploded, killing and wounding hundreds of Japanese soldiers. Liu had already disguised himself and fled far away on a British ship.</p>
<h3>Record of the Remaining Style of Sleeping on Brushwood and Tasting Gall</h3>
<p>— Baoqinxuan Master</p>
<p>Our Yue is the place where King Goujian of Yue slept on brushwood and tasted gall. Modern revolutionary martyrs, such as Qiu Jin, Xu Xilin, and Tao Chengzhang, were all born there. The remaining legacy and style have lasted for thousands of years. Recently, the violent Japanese have been rampant, and the whole country is gnashing its teeth. The sound of resisting Japan and saving the country is boiling throughout the country. And in Yuezhong, there are old widows, shepherds, scholars, and gamblers who are generous and enthusiastic to avenge the country's hatred. It is impossible not to record this. The Record of the Remaining Style of Sleeping on Brushwood and Tasting Gall is made.</p>
<p>Bu Shi Among Women Thirty miles away from the city, there is a village called Zhu Chu. Most of the villagers are surnamed Chen. There is an old widow, Madam Shan, who is over sixty years old. She has no son. A daughter is married to the Fu family in the neighboring village. Her husband was in Japan, engaged in the silk business, and the family was quite well-off. Her husband has been dead for more than ten years. Madam Shan owns an inheritance of 20,000 yuan, so she does not have to worry about freezing and starvation. One day, an anti-Japanese propaganda team came to the village to give a speech. Madam Shan also listened to the speech in the crowd. When she heard about the atrocities of the Japanese army and the tragic situation of our soldiers and civilians, she could not help but burst into tears. She said to the people in the team, "The foreign soldiers are so rampant. Is there no loyal minister in China to defend the country? I am old and have no children. If China goes to war with Japan, I am willing to donate half of my property to help the military expenses." Madam Shan had also read books and recognized characters, and old novels such as Yue Zhuan and Three Kingdoms were her only pastime. The old woman has this insight. Why is she so much more than Bu Shi of the Han Dynasty?</p>
<p>Eradicating Stains A shepherd boy, A Si, is from Dongpu. He lost his parents when he was young and lived with his uncle. His uncle ordered A Si to herd sheep. There is an ancient temple where A Si herds sheep. A huge Ajinomoto advertisement is painted on the wall. When A Si was herding sheep, he scraped the wall with a small knife. Three days later, the advertisement below had been scraped off. Only the upper part was short and could not reach. A Si then brought a bamboo ladder to continue scraping the wall. It happened to be seen by the temple owner, who blamed him for destroying the temple wall. A Si argued eloquently, saying that this was an advertisement for Japanese goods. How could it be allowed to exist? Now that I have scraped it off, I have actually eradicated the stains for your temple. You don't appreciate me, but blame me? The temple owner was speechless and had no choice.</p>
<p>Special Storytelling Feng from Shangjia Village is a former Qing Dynasty scholar who failed to pass the imperial examination. He sets up a private school to teach students. His appearance is extremely pedantic. Although Feng is a dullard, he pays close attention to current affairs. After class, he often goes to the village newspaper to read the newspaper. Since the Mukden Incident, Feng's reading of the newspaper has become even more energetic. Feng must go to a small teahouse to drink tea every night. Usually, he just chats casually, but recently he specializes in talking about the atrocities of the Japanese. He extracts materials from the newspaper, adds and subtracts them himself, and imitates storytelling. His oral narration and gestures are vivid and detailed. Most of the listeners are moved. Recently, the business of small teahouses has become prosperous because of this. The villagers all come to listen to this special storytelling.</p>
<p>Sharpening With Care Lai Sanbao, who lives in the same village as Feng, lives by gambling. He is honest, has great strength, and raises his fist at any disagreement. Therefore, people are afraid of him. After hearing Feng's narration of the Japanese atrocities, Sanbao could not help but feel resentful. He specially ordered a pure steel dagger from a blacksmith and played with it day and night. Whenever he wins a gamble, no matter how much or how little, he must withdraw half of it and store it in a small grocery store set up by his wife's uncle. When asked about the meaning of buying a knife and saving money, Sanbao said resolutely, "The dagger is for the evil thieves like Honjo Shigeru, Doihara Kenji, and Yoshizawa. The money is saved to prepare for the travel expenses to the Northeast." Some people ridiculed him for being癡者, but Sanbao never moved. Sharpening with care, vowing to make a quick strike.</p>
<h3>Good Horse</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>For more than ten years, our country has been rising and falling, and has been in civil war. The so-called barbarian struggle and fratricide are not glorious in victory. It is painful to speak of. Only this time, General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province was able to resist the violent Japanese with an isolated army. He has fought hard for days and frustrated their fierce attack. Such a record is worthy of admiration by the Chinese people. Looking at his anti-Japanese telegram, his generous words arouse a sense of loyalty and courage in people. With this brave general to support the precarious situation in the dying Northeast, it is enough to make the Japanese bandits look at him with fear. Therefore, the people should express their respect to this General Ma. Everyone said in unison and drank with joy, "Good Horse!"</p>
<h3>Presented to General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiu</p>
<p>Two hundred thousand people disarmed together, but the general alone wielded the Lu Yang spear. The Zhang family's pigs and dogs should be ashamed to die. They can recognize the Ma Fubo of Longjiang.</p>
<h3>Reminiscing General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Shi Chuqing</p>
<p>I am sad to see the battle clouds spreading over the Northeast, and the first battle shattered the enemy's courage. Qi said that the general had many ancient meanings, but only because iron and stone are loyal livers.</p>
<p>Swear to express the national crisis and make a miracle. The middle pillar of the rapids is admired by the crowd. The sound of the bugle is silent and the mountain is dark, with 100,000 soldiers and one general.</p>
<h3>Three Voices on Guofu Road</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>Sadness There is A'er from Gaoyou, a Jiangbei native who is not good at it. His personal life is to pull a rickshaw. A'er's wife is not spoiled and loves to eat and drink. Therefore, she is unwilling to let her husband suffer alone. Therefore, every day in the sweltering heat, when we are in the midst of fragrant dreams, before the morning light comes out, we are often awakened by A'er's wife's high-pitched voice selling 洋糖 hot zongzi. Because her voice is clear and sad, like an ape crying in an empty valley, a widow weeping at night, we can't bear to hear it, but there is no way to avoid it. Because it is morning, so-called energetic, there is not much pain. Recently, A'er's wife changed to selling sunflower seeds in the afternoon because the season is winter and the zongzi automatically fell. Because it is evening, it feels even more sad to hear it.</p>
<p>Selling newspapers Since the capital was attacked by the violent Japanese and took the risk of being unrighteous, the sales of the two major newspapers, Shen and Xin, in Shanghai have increased sharply. If you buy these two major newspapers from newspaper vendors after 6:00 or 7:00 PM every night, they will often shake their heads and have no way to respond. It can be seen that when disaster strikes, there are indeed many people who care about national affairs. On Guofu Road, after the fish began to leap, we often heard the voices of many children selling various evening newspapers, high into the clouds. This sang and the other harmonized, which was quite lively.</p>
<p>The sound of cars and horses Although there are many cars and horses in the capital, even Shanghai is not as good. The most complex place for the sound of cars is Guofu Road. Guofu Road is on the left. There is a small train station. The train comes and goes dozens of times a day. It opens in the faint morning light and rests until late at night. Behind Guofu Road is the Executive Yuan, as well as agencies such as civil servants, military参军, and the main计处, and the General Staff. To the right of Guofu is the passage to Central University, the Ministry of Education, the Examination院, and Kongdao, which leads to Xiaguan. Therefore, from early morning to late night every day, we often hear the呜呜 sound of cars, the 轔轔 sound of horse-drawn carriages, the sound of得得 horseshoes, the ding-ding sound of rickshaw bells, and the sound of the small train releasing steam. The sounds respond to each other and there is not a moment of silence. This is a true place where the four directions converge and cars and horses are mixed.</p>
<h3>A Record of Mr. Yan's Gourd Divination</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The gourd divination of the novelist, Mr. Yan Fusun, is remarkably insightful and widely known. All who come to inquire about characters and stop their carriages praise its miraculous nature. The characters he determines emerge from a "sealed gourd," demonstrating ingenious thought and natural inspiration. He keeps a complete set of dictionaries on his desk, and can arbitrarily select two characters to make on-the-spot judgments with incredible speed. Mr. Yan has long been afflicted with illness, and has moved his residence to Lixian Lane on the south side of the Great Horse Road in the French Concession, west of the waterworks. However, he is beset by poverty and illness, and can only勉力 (exhaust his efforts) grind his inkstone, rack his brains, and pour out his heart. His livelihood is very difficult. Gourd divination can be used to predict anything. He now works full-time. My relatives and friends recently consulted him on several matters, and his predictions were strikingly accurate. I will select and record one or two examples to provide material for conversation.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Liu planned to go to Tianjin. Before his departure, he divined the characters "厄" (è, misfortune) and "少" (shǎo, few). Mr. Yan immediately judged, "The character '厄' reveals a '角' (jiǎo, horn), which must signify '危' (wēi, danger). The character '少' forms '步' (bù, step) because of '止' (zhǐ, stop). Danger is lurking there, so it is better to stop." Mr. Liu hesitated upon hearing this, and then canceled his trip. It was later learned that the day he was scheduled to arrive in Tianjin was precisely when a riot broke out. The gourd divination can indeed be called miraculous.</p>
<p>In the match between the Donghua Football Team and the Norsenburg team, during the first half, Mr. Yan used the characters "甬" (yǒng, brave) and "卡" (kǎ, card) to predict that both sides would be brave but lack strength, and that neither side would prevail. As a result, both teams scored zero, resulting in a tie. Before the final match, a group of fans recommended that Mr. Da Wu go to divine. From the "sealed gourd," he shook out the characters "金" (jīn, gold) and "月" (yuè, moon). Mr. Yan said, "Gold first, moon after. '金' represents the image of breaking a '釜' (fǔ, pot, i.e. '破釜沉舟' pòfǔchénzhōu 'burn one's boats'). Adding '券' (quàn, ticket) to the left side of '月' forms '勝' (shèng, victory). Therefore, if you are determined to win, victory will be assured." In the fierce battle, our team succeeded. Tens of thousands of fans were delighted. The iron pen of Mr. Junping complements our iron army, which is also a good story.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang, an accountant at the Maoxin Shoe Factory, was addicted to dog racing and refused to change his ways. He once shook out the characters "昔" (xī, past) and "狺" (yín, barking) from the gourd. Mr. Yan judged, "First, the character '昔' already has no '手' (shǒu, hand) to '措' (cuò, arrange, i.e., '束手無策' shùshǒuwúcè 'at one's wits end'). Finally, the character '狺' ultimately fears that '犬' (quǎn, dog) will lead to '獄' (yù, prison)." Mr. Huang did not believe this and continued his immersion as before. A few weeks ago, he was indeed imprisoned for embezzling public funds due to losses from dog racing. The predictions were all confirmed. Peng Yongsheng, a partner at Pengfuji Eyeglasses in Sanpailou, along with his fellow villager Hu Zhilin, consulted about their fortunes this spring, shaking out the characters "儉" (jiǎn, frugal) and "佳" (jiā, good). Mr. Yan said, "Looking closely at the character '儉', '人' (rén, person) is in a '險' (xiǎn, dangerous) situation. The character '佳' has a good appearance, but upon further study, it is the top of the character '焦' (jiāo, scorched). If you do not leave quickly this year, you may suffer a '焦頭' (jiāotóu, scorched head) and be in a terrible state." At the time, Mr. Yan made a straightforward judgment based on reason. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out at Pengfuji Eyeglasses a few days ago, and Peng Yongsheng tragically perished in it. Most strangely, it confirmed the "scorched head" prophecy. This matter was spread by a person named Hu. Is Mr. Yan's gourd indeed magical?</p>
<h3>Leisurely Chat at the Di Xiang Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Wang Hu</p>
<p>In this world, people inevitably face both praise and criticism, and both arise from others. It depends on the speaker's perspective. Those who praise Wang Hu say he is thrifty in his personal life, honest as an official, and diligent in his work. Those who criticize Wang Hu say he is fishing for fame and reputation, deceiving the world and stealing a name. Should we believe the praisers or the critics? Perhaps the criticisms are warranted? But right and wrong will always be publicly judged. Hu's courtesy name is Tieshan. He is from Zhili, entered the Hanlin Academy, and was assigned to be a county magistrate after completing his studies. He served in Junlian, Sichuan, where he was praised as a "Wen Weng" (a wise and benevolent official). At that time, Cen Yunjie (Chunxuan) was the governor of Guangxi and heard of Hu's virtue. He requested Hu be transferred to Guangxi to command the unified army. When Cen Yunjie was promoted to governor of Guangdong, he recommended Hu to be the garrison commander of Qinlian. Many bandits had long plagued the counties of Qinlian. Hu led his troops to fight the bandits, but they were defeated and the city fell. Hu was stripped of his position and investigated. After a long time, the governor of the east, Xi Qingbi (Liang), requested that his original position be restored. He was appointed to the Southeast Road of Jilin. He was selfless in discussing politics and diligent in handling affairs. After the establishment of the Republic of China, he successively served as a magistrate in Zhili and was promoted to governor of the capital. He was transferred to the Hunan Provincial High Commissioner, but did not take office. He was appointed as a censor in the Board of Audit. He was known as the "Iron-Faced Censor." Qi Yaoshan had long managed civil affairs in Jiangsu and sought to leave. The governor of Jiangsu, Li Chun, recommended several people to the government, with Hu at the top of the list. The government removed Qi Yaoshan from his position and ordered Hu to succeed him. Hu lingered in the northern capital and did not go. One day, the whole city spread the news that the new provincial governor had arrived and had taken up residence in the official residence, awaiting the day to take office. Everyone was greatly surprised. Hu had taken the Jinpu train, crossed the river in disguise, and walked alone to the small train station (the trains that connect the inner and outer city of Nanjing are called small trains). He boarded the train and entered the city, then walked alone to the provincial governor's office. The guards stopped him and asked, "Who are you here to see?" Hu smiled without answering, but said, "I am qualified to enter." The guards did not dare to make a decision on their own and asked their superior. The superior was from the north and, seeing Hu's face, recognized him. He knew that Hu usually liked to disguise himself as figures like Shi Gong (a legendary upright official). He bowed respectfully and said, "Are you perhaps the new provincial governor?" Hu said, "Yes." The superior said, "We have been waiting for a long time," and escorted him in. Several followers also arrived from other routes. The news spread, and those who sought to pay their respects filled the door. After Hu took office, a candidate circuit intendant came to pay his respects. Hu ordered the middle gate to be opened and personally greeted him at the foot of the steps. With a solemn expression, he said, "Commissioner, how have you been since we last met?" The man stammered and could not answer. After sitting for a short time, Hu ordered the guest to be seen off. The man remained uneasy and speechless. He visited three times, and Hu treated him the same way each time. When Hu was serving in Sichuan, the man, as a circuit intendant, served as the bandit suppression commissioner and had criticized Hu to the governor. Hu, because of his lower rank, did not dare to resist. Now, he had begun to retaliate in a humorous way. Therefore, the man was not employed during Hu's tenure and left for another place. His actions were like this. Some say that Hu rose from a county magistrate to a high-ranking official, able to put into practice the saying "Civil officials should not be greedy for money," and his character is naturally higher than others. But his heart is small and easily filled with pride, and his hypocrisy and eagerness for praise cannot be concealed.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Arrives in Shanghai Again (21)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>"Meat" is the most fashionable thing in Shanghai recently. No matter what film is shown in the cinema, the advertisements always use large woodcuts with the words "sensual" and "meaty." No matter where a novel is published, it is about "meat," "spirit," and being intoxicated by the description of meat. There are even so-called "salty meat shops," which are more convenient than brothels. Transactions are made on the spot, and goods are sold in stock. Everyone in Shanghai, whether they are from Shanghai or not, has become Chen Ping of the Han Dynasty, and everyone is going to cut a piece of it.</p>
<p>Because meat is enough to move people, the color of meat has also become fashionable. The country bumpkin thinks: "I must have seen it wrong." At first, I saw several girls wearing very beautiful clothes, but I wondered why they didn't wear socks. I thought it was because it was summer. Now I understand. Then, I just saw several shop assistants in the shops here who were shirtless. Maybe they have never been shirtless, but everyone is wearing a flesh-colored undershirt.</p>
<p>That girl still grabbed the country bumpkin and wouldn't let go.</p>
<p>"Let go, we can talk nicely." The country bumpkin was surrounded. He felt a little embarrassed to be grabbed by a woman on the street.</p>
<p>"Our business has been bad these past two days, so we are burning incense to the road to improve our luck. Why did you come to stamp it out? You are bringing us bad luck."</p>
<p>"Burning incense to the road? Why don't you burn it at home? Instead, you burn it along the street."</p>
<p>"Burning it at home or burning it along the road is none of your business. You shouldn't have come to bring us bad luck." That girl grabbed the country bumpkin and wouldn't let him go.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a passerby knew that the country bumpkin was surrounded and rushed to mediate. He said, "He meant well, he was afraid that you would burn your clothes. Who knew what you were burning incense to the road for? Stamping out the fire is no big deal, you can just get some more scraps of paper to burn."</p>
<p>With a few words, he finally helped the country bumpkin out of the siege. The country bumpkin quickly thanked this friend who helped him out of the siege, and said while panting:</p>
<p>"What do these women do? They are so fierce! Their strength is even greater than ours men. Once they grab you, you can't shake them off."</p>
<p>"These are all prostitutes. They gather in this area. Even if you don't provoke them, they will still pull and tug at you. What's more, you went to talk to them. They see that you are not like the old Shanghai people, and they just said that you stamped out the fire they were burning to the road, using this as an excuse to rip you off."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin had heard people say that there were many prostitutes in Shanghai. But I didn't expect them to be so fierce, surrounding me like this. How can the Shanghai authorities allow them to pull people like that along the road without prohibiting them? In our village, there are definitely no such shameless women.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Climb Relentlessly</h3>
<p>Continuing to Rise Beyond Twenty-Four Taels</p>
<p>All Day in the Midst of Furious Winds and Rain. Yesterday's gold market saw significant changes, with morning highs and afternoon lows, followed by a recovery in the later market. Throughout the day, there were fluctuations of twenty taels, the situation was chaotic, with no real confidence, and people were confused. As a result, there was a sharp increase of more than twenty-four taels. Financial departments in businesses were constantly changing, and the silver market moved in a different direction, with the pound rising and the dollar falling, which had been expected the day before. Only the European market was relatively good, with gold prices opening high and immediately breaking through the 660-tael mark. There was a rush of large-scale purchases, and many were covering their short positions. In addition, both official and unofficial exchange rates were tight, with exchange rates narrowing by three notches. The market felt particularly strong, already breaking through the 70-tael mark. Unexpectedly, speculators and large syndicates seized the opportunity to dump their holdings, and also because foreign exchange suddenly became easier to obtain, and banks were willing to sell. There were also reports from abroad that European and American countries were planning to maintain silver prices. In reality, cash reserves had increased compared to before, but there was no buying power. Because of this, they retreated quickly, falling more than twenty taels sharply. The market was expected to be weak in the later market because there is no market on Wednesdays as is typical for the foreign exchange market. But because Indian exchange rates fell repeatedly, buying interest in the market was strong, again exceeding the 60-tael mark, with a surge of more than ten taels. It is predicted that the major players expect a decline this morning.</p>
<p>Early Morning Fluctuations were Extremely Frightening. From the early opening, the price rose by eighteen taels and eight qian (0.88 taels), to 662.5 taels. Major players were indeed up eight-sevenths of a fen, and forward prices up thirteen-sixteenths of a fen. Silver prices, however, fell by one and a half fen, and were aggressively sold by the United States, so people's mood was extremely high. The Cantonese banks sold slightly. The price decreased from 66 taels and 3 qian to 59 taels and 5 qian. In a moment, Yifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanxing Yong, Yifeng, and foreign merchants such as Qiaozhifu (乔直夫) competed to buy. Also, British gold became tight, and HSBC initially absorbed 1.89375. Afterwards, similar firms settle only 1.875 to 0.625, hence the gold market soared by more than ten taels, but there were two or three taels of head-scratching (small moves). By the time British gold was opened, it was at 72 taels, with the listed price being cut down by 75, and the US dollar at 1 yuan and 25 fen, so it was even more firm. The interior was even more firm, only settling at 1.8 taels. After this, it seemed to reveal a small face. Generally, the long position took advantage of this to sell. It is estimated that Yu Da, Xiexing Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, and Hengyu were all selling, almost as if the first order had been raised by 9 bianshi (辩士), beyond 33 yuan in US dollars. The air no longer existed. It was heard that the short position for swap trades instead was advanced by three to four taels, once mutually traded by Hengxing and Yingfeng Heng, so the market price plummeted. By ten o'clock, it was only 59.5 taels. Not long after, it went up three to four taels. At around 10:30, it was 63.5 taels. After entering, a sudden wind and wave arose, and there were more sellers than usual. Consequently, British gold at 1.9125 and the US dollar at 33.6875 yuan could all be purchased and settled, again dropping sharply by more than ten taels. At 11:45, it was 52 taels, but in the meantime, there were still two or three taels of head-scratching (small moves). It then increased to 56 taels, and by the afternoon, it was 54 taels and 3 qian, reaching almost 5 taels. The posted price was changed to 756 taels, calculated to be down 100 taels and change.</p>
<p>After Closing, a Slight Decline Was Revealed. The market opened in the later market, immediately dropping to 52.5 taels, because the Dalian gang (speculators from Dalian) first dumped their holdings. Then foreign merchant Qiaozhifu covered his short position, suddenly rising to 58 taels. Shunli came out and retreated to 53.5 taels. After the recovery, there were rises and falls of more than two taels. Around 3:00, a hidden upward trend emerged again. Because Indian exchange rates were repeatedly reported to be shrinking, gold prices increased to 55 to 56 taels. However, there were still one or two taels of fluctuations. After 3:30, it rose steadily. Qian Changxiang, Daxing Yong, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, and others competed to advance. It had broken out of 60 taels. Then Zhifeng Yong, Da Cheng Hengyu, Zhen Changxiang, and Yuanxing Yong fell in to buy, but Hengxing Shengda sold slightly. After 4:00, Indian exchange rates again shrank by seven to six anna (falling a total of 2 rupees and 2 anna in three instances), and people's hearts were directed upward. Major players looked bearish. At 4:20, it reached 68.5 taels, reaching a state of sharp momentum. At 4:30 when the market closed, it was at 68 taels, an increase of 24 taels and 3 qian compared to the previous day. Unexpectedly, after the market closed, Qian Changxiang and Yuanchun sold goods, and it suddenly fell sharply by five or six taels. In the end, it was calculated to be approximately 62 taels, an unexpected change. The maximum price for the entire day was 72 taels, and the minimum price was 52 taels, a difference of twenty taels. The price of early market goods was 63.5 taels, the afternoon close was 55 taels, the afternoon was 3 taels and 2 qian, and the close was 63 taels. The posted price was calculated to be down 102 to 3 taels down to 87 to 8 taels. The registered prices were 57 to 54 taels in the morning and 71 to 68 taels in the afternoon. Supplementary water was 57 taels in the morning and 71 taels in the afternoon. The bare strip only increased by 6 to 4 taels because the road forward was dull.</p>
<p>The Inflow and Outflow of Various Firms Were Chaotic Beyond Normal. The trading on the table was chaotic and disordered. It is estimated that Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Taifengcheng, Futaiheng, Yuanxing Yong, and Yifeng all advanced. Qiaozhifu advanced by covering more than 1,000 strips. Fuyu, Yifeng Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Yuantai, Fuchang, Daxing Yong, Bingxing, Dakang, and Tongtaichang saw heavy inflows and outflows. Hengxing and Shengda came out with 6 to 700 strips. Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu, Yu Da, Richang, Yuankangxiang, Cuichangyong, Shunli, and Wanxing all sold. In the afternoon, Yu Da, Qiaozhifu, Yuankangxiang, Daxing Yong, Dacheng, Zhifeng Yong, Zhen Changxiang, Yuanxing Yong, and Hengyu all advanced. Qian Changxiang, Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, and Bingxing sometimes sold and sometimes advanced. Dadecheng, Hengxing, and Shunli had more outflows and fewer inflows. Mr. Wu sold some. The rest of the firms had different inflows and outflows. Foreign merchant Qiaozhifu bought 1,000 and several hundred short positions, roughly balancing out the position. The Dalian gang collectively sold 3,000 and several hundred strips, advancing more than 800 strips. The Cantonese gang collectively sold more than 900 strips and advanced more than 1,000 strips.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market Continues to Show an Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British silver rose and the American silver fell. The market turned soft. In exchange, the pound rose against the dollar, and the dollar fell against the pound. The Shanghai market showed a steady trend. HSBC listed prices that were cut by three marks, with British gold at 75 and 1 shilling and 8 pence and 25, the US dollar at 1 yuan and 25 and 31.75 yuan, and Hong Kong slightly smaller at 0.0625, at 76 taels and 875. The rest were cut prices. The domestic market was initially firm and then tightened, before turning loose again. However, the complexity was commonplace. The gold market had raging wind and waves, and there were twenty taels of twists and turns in the front and later market. In light of this, the result of the foreign exchange market compared to yesterday counted to a cut of British gold at 3125 and a cut of the US dollar at 4375. There was no consistency between Chinese merchants when paying. Cheng Feng Yong and others were扒结 (settling short term), and the British and American Jewish merchant Qiaozhifu also settled. The British gold, because Fuchang and others recently swapped forward dates with various banks, had British gold paying 0.0625, and at times, had no fee. The cumulative counts were that all accounts had sold more than they bought, counting to about 100,000 pounds in British gold and 300 to 400,000 yuan in US dollars. In the afternoon, the typical market didn't exist because it was a Wednesday.</p>
<p>British Exchange: There were 75 swings within the domestic market over half a day. The tightest price was 1 shilling, 8 pence and a half, and the loosest price was 9 pence and 25. In the morning, the asking price was about 9 pence, and the buying price was 125. HSBC advanced to 1.89375 for February, and mutually traded 875 for January with Sumitomo. Shanghai offered 75 to 6875, and the Sino-Belgian bank offered 9 pence for February. Shanghai had a favorable match of 125 for March. The afternoon close was 1.925 for the asking price and 1.93125 for the buying price.</p>
<p>American Exchange: There was 1 yuan and 25 fen of rise and fall within the domestic market. The tightest price was 32 and a half yuan, and the loosest price was 33.75 yuan. In the early market, the asking price was about 33 yuan, and the buying price was 33.125 yuan. Taiwan Meifeng mutually did 33.125 yuan for January, and the wheat firm advanced 33 yuan. The British bank advanced 32.75 yuan for January, Shengda offered 32.6875 yuan for March, Pangen wheat did a mutual 75 for March, and HSBC Sanjing mutually did 8125 for February. At midday, Sanjin offered 33.625 yuan, and Zhengjin offered 33.6875 yuan (Meng sold out), and Zhengjin advanced 33.75 yuan for January. (Mongol sold out) The afternoon close was 33.6875 yuan for the asking price and 33.8125 yuan for the buying price. One US dollar combined with silver was said to be 3 taels, 1 qian, 4 fen, 960.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Silver Market Returned to Growth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to Reuters, bulk silver turned to growth again. For example, recent was raised again by 875 to 18 pence and 875, and forward was also raised by 8125 to 18 pence and 75. India bought slightly at the base, and speculators advanced and then withdrew, so the market was shaky and uncertain. The market turned weak after the close. The United States was inclined to sell under the listed price. Also, there was a New York telegram, the price of American silver was still seen to be falling sharply. Like spot, it was cut by one and a half fen to a triangle and 1 fen and 125. The pound against the dollar was raised by 625 to 3 yuan, 7 jiao, 8 fen and 25, and the dollar against the pound was reduced by a small amount of 1 fen and 25 to 3 yuan, 7 jiao, 7 fen and 75. The London Shanghai shilling was cut short by 1 bianshi and 125 to 1 shilling and 10 pence. The Mumbai spot was reduced by a small amount of 2 rupees and 12 anna to 61 rupees. Forward was also reduced by a small amount of 44 anna to 61 rupees and 4 anna.</p>
<h3>The Silver Market Has Still Not Escaped the Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the silver market appeared to be slightly loose on the surface, the content was still not very good. In the early market, the silver short-term loan rate was 4 qian and 5 fen, and in the midday market, it was 4 qian. The water added to the划头 (dishonored checks) gradually fell from more than 3 qian to 1 qian and 8 or 9 fen. The bank's listed price was 1 qian and 8 fen. The foreign cent market price was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li and a half in the early market, and 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li and 3 hao and 7 hu and a half in the midday market. As a result, it was slightly less than one li compared to the previous day. The foreign settlement money orders that were made were 1.14 million in the early market and 950,000 in the midday market. Paper money was 35,000 in the early market and 10,000 in the midday market. Off-site paper money was 115,000 in the early market and 75,000 in the midday market. In the early market, inter-bank transactions were 700,000, and in the midday market, inter-bank transactions were 500,000. The foreign accounts of various banks received and disbursed more than 1.7 million, and the inflow and outflow of paper money exceeded 2.1 million. Qian Zhuang (钱庄 native banks) received and disbursed more than 4.7 million in foreign promissory notes, and more than 1.5 million in foreign 划头 (dishonored checks). The inflow and outflow of foreign loan placements exceeded 1.4 million, and the small Qian Zhuang traded more than 700,000. According to the receipt of money at the various banks, Chinese merchants received and disbursed more than 2.3 million in money orders, foreign merchants received and disbursed more than 1.9 million in money orders, various types of freight and taxes totaled more than 8.1 million, special money totaled more than 3 million, 500,000 were warehoused, and 600,000 were shipped. Various Qian Zhuang received and disbursed more than 44 million in foreign promissory notes, and more than 4.22 million in 划头 (dishonored checks). The collection of various forms of money from all routes exceeded 900,000 and received in cash from 300 to 400,000. The江南小洋 (small silver dollar from Jiangnan) was 6 qian, 5 fen and 2 li in the early market, and 6 qian, 5 fen and 2 li and 7 hao and a half in the midday market. The transaction was 2,000 jiao (角) in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the midday market. The Guangdong 小洋 (small silver dollar) was 6 qian, 5 fen and 1 li in the early market and 6 qian, 5 fen and half a li in the midday market. The transaction was 125,000 jiao in the early market and 15,000 jiao in the midday market. 1,000 copper coins were changed for small coins, and again for 379,500 cash. More than 29,000 strings were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Were Dull and Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw spot goods with only the consolidated tax trading 1,000 yuan in the morning. All other bonds had no transactions throughout the day. The futures market was still uninspired. Buying and selling and inflows and outflows remained calm. In addition to the consolidated salt tax trading not being lonely, the remainder continued to be quite few. According to estimates, over 3.7 million were transacted in the morning market and over 2.3 million in the late market, totaling 6.1 million yuan. The trends of each bond saw that the surrounding conditions were extremely dull. Because the League of Nations did not publicly release much information, it was difficult to expect major developments in the short-term. The domestic situation also lacked new changes, causing the market's mood to remain cold. A check of the market prices of each bond yesterday saw that the pre-market and post-market continued to only have about half a yuan of changes, and the morning was relatively firm, mostly unchanged from the previous day. The later market was on a downward trend and, compared to the previous day, only the 20 and 19 customs were slightly firmer, while the others fell back. However, with the exception of the dismissal of troops and the salt tax this month's contract falling by one yuan, the remainder only fell by a few jiao. Since the securities market in recent weeks began, the trend has consistently been extremely chaotic. The situation during the day was not slightly different from before, and it was the most static period of falling prices. To observe from the current market, if there are no major changes in the surrounding environment, there should be no large rises or falls in the short-term.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Selling Atmosphere Recovered</h3>
<p>The yarn market has softened and the situation is very weak. Due to the deterioration of the situation and the urgency of silver, actual sales are even quieter. Each gang has announced a halt due to the strange financial drought and the difficulty of commercial development. Therefore, the majority of people are inclined to dump, so the market has become tired.</p>
<p>Human Standard Decreases by One Two Outside. The opening of the Human Standard's pre-market saw that the people's hearts were not excited as the nation's affairs had many difficulties, and the situation was leisure and loose.

<h3>Cotton Market Enters Another Slump</h3>
<p>The cotton market has turned weak due to the sluggishness of American cotton. The gold market remains strong, but bullish investors are cashing out their positions as the market rises. In reality, spot cotton trading is stagnant, and factories have no intention of purchasing local cotton due to the high prices, which are being undercut by foreign cotton. As a result, the cotton market is softening again. There was some anticipation of a short squeeze earlier this month, but now spot cotton trading has halted, and the tight money market has led to the unloading of purchased cotton. Consequently, the market has loosened and is trending downward.</p>
<p>Recent Speculative Buying Emerges. The Shanghai cotton futures market opened with a slightly bullish sentiment due to steady American cotton prices and rising gold prices, with all months rising by two mace. The market turned weak during the second and third sessions, ultimately falling by 1.5 mace. In the afternoon, near-month bullish investors emerged, further loosening the market, with all months falling by 1.5 to 2 mace. The total volume traded for the day was 74,300 bales. Rongxing traded 1,900 bales, Gengfeng 5,100 bales, Yiyu 3,200 bales, and Dafeng 1,900 bales. Buyers included Changfeng with 2,300 bales, Yifeng with 2,700 bales, and Shenchang with 2,300 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton: Only Bales Unopened. It is said that there were no spot cotton transactions.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially saw a quiet and firm market due to excessive rainfall and a shortage of sellers, but later weakened due to bullish investors cashing out. Futures prices rose or fell by one to three points. Spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by two to four points, and spot prices rose by one point. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was firm and stable, with Pingle and Aola rising by 2.75 rupees and Bai Luoxi rising by 1.75 rupees.

<h3>Grains: Hesha Rice Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, sources from Lilu Road reported 17 or 18 boats, with about 30 boats from the Tongbang of Shanghai and Jiangsu. The market in this area was more active than in the previous session. There was some hoarding of Xixin and early rice, with prices rising by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Although the demand for thin rice was active, the quantity was small, with prices rising by 0.1 yuan. There was some accumulation of rice in Zhongguan, so sales were sluggish. Transactions in Yinhua glutinous rice cakes were quite good, with prices rising by 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, the supply was not abundant, and transactions in both urban and rural areas were stagnant. Stores took advantage of this opportunity to add to their inventory, so buyers were demanding lower prices. There were about 5,000 shi of Hesha rice. High-quality Changxi new glutinous rice stabilized, while lower-quality rice rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The Hakka dealers made some purchases of green-skinned thin rice, but the market showed no significant movement. There were very few deliveries of high-quality rice in custom packaging. Factory prices remained firm. There was a shortage of high-quality Luyang glutinous rice from the Northern Gang, with prices rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. There was no change in the price of Yinyuan glutinous rice.</p>
<h3>This Area Actively Purchases Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw increased activity due to rising gold prices, which increased production costs. Foreign firms did not sell futures contracts, while local merchants increased their purchases. Market sentiment showed a consistent upward trend. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were offered at 11.5 yuan, and 2,000 bags of small broken rice were offered at 10.2 yuan. No new futures contracts were opened. 600 tons of returned cargo were transacted, with small broken rice at 4.83 taels per mace for January, 5.1 taels for April (weighed), and 5.16 taels for May (weighed). Compared to the previous session, spot prices rose by several cents, and futures prices remained firm. Taizhou rice continued to arrive and was purchased by local merchants for 2,500 bags at 11.2 yuan to 10.25 yuan. The market was also better than in the previous session, mainly because local demand has been strong recently, and sentiment is generally bullish.</p>
<h3>Distant-Month Flour Futures Being Dumped by Factories</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for all months showed a temporary bullish trend. The price of imported wheat rose by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, and the gold market did not show any signs of falling. Therefore, after the opening, near- and far-term prices rose by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. However, in subsequent sessions, factories continued to sell, and domestic customers also took advantage of the rise to sell, so the market turned soft again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the spot sales group was hesitant, and the dumping of imported wheat futures resumed. One could tell that there were continued transactions in imported wheat from the factory's dumping of overdue contracts. Therefore, the market sentiment for all months trended downward. As a result, this month fell by 0.0135 yuan compared to the previous day, December fell by 0.01 yuan, January fell by 0.005 yuan, February fell by 0.0075 yuan, and April fell by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Initially Bullish Then Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for all months generally showed a trend of initially bullishness followed by flatness. Initially, the prices of imported wheat for near- and far-term delivery generally rose by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. However, in the afternoon sessions, the flour market was not good, and the selling of imported wheat futures continued. Factories would purchase as soon as prices were favorable. Practically speaking, it was difficult to be overly bullish, as both local and out-of-town traders could not bear the pressure of dumping after ordering imported wheat. As a result, this month was unchanged, December was down by 0.01 yuan, January was unchanged, February was down by 0.02 yuan, March was up by 0.01 yuan, and April was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Pingshui Pearl Tea Sales to Europe Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in Shanghai, there was slightly more interest from European and American merchants in Huzhou Pingshui green tea. Among them, the top two or three grades of pearl tea saw relatively active trading, and market prices were quite firm. The market for Tunxi Zhenmei and Zhenmei Needle green tea seemed more active than before, but tea prices were low, and tea merchants were generally pessimistic. Furthermore, the sales of Wuyuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei and Gongxi green tea remained stagnant, and the overall trend was not good.</p>
<h3>Coal: Changxing Coal Supply Fails to Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Since the Zhejiang provincial government took over the Changxing Coal Mine, daily coal production has increased to more than 300 tons. Most of the power plants and silk factories in Zhejiang province use this coal, so sales are quite large, and the daily supply cannot meet the demand. As a result, very little coal arrives in Shanghai, and prices are firm. The latest prices for various types of coal are as follows: Changxing lump coal, 11.5 taels; Changxing mixed coal, 8.75 taels; Guangxing lump coal, 12.5 taels; Guangxing selected coal, 9.75 taels.</p>

<h3>Candor</h3>
<p>— Xu Shui Lin</p>
<p>A Reply from an Actress</p>
<p>Yin Jun,</p>
<p>I truly didn't expect that you would have such a request of me. Perhaps it's my fault for having led you on. But I'm always like this with friends, no, not friends, acquaintances. I'm always like this with acquaintances, and not only with acquaintances, but with all the audience. It's not surprising that others behave like this toward me. Not to mention a year, there are always several instances within a month, or even a week. It's rare for me to not receive one of these kinds of annoying letters every morning.</p>
<p>The words you use to compliment and praise me, others have used them to death, and there are others who are ten or a hundred times more nauseating than what you've said. At first, I was indeed somewhat moved, but now I'm completely used to it. It only arouses my revulsion. Sometimes, if the writing or wording is good, it amuses me.</p>
<p>Heavy makeup, enchanting looks, this has become a necessity in my daily life. If I don't do this, I can't attract people's attention. If I can't attract people's attention, then my business will fail, and my reputation will fall. Which theater owner would still hire me? How would my life and the lives of my family be sustained? This has already become a habit, and it involves the role of professionalization and commercialization. Seducing people is a sin in ordinary society, but for us, it's an art, a profession. Asking an actress not to seduce people is like telling people not to eat. Is that possible?</p>
<p>In the beginning, this seduction was very awkward and embarrassing. I thought it was a sin, especially offstage. But now I'm used to it. I'm very happy to see so many men chasing after me. I often use many inhumane methods to embarrass them, to trample on them, yet they still follow me with gentle smiles.</p>
<p>Some give up after being tricked once or twice, while others continue to follow me even after being tricked repeatedly. Some, though normally very stingy, become completely different people once they're hooked. If I set my mind to it, they would be willing to go bankrupt. Some fools spend a great price but never get the chance to even once. Some smart ones get the opportunity without spending anything. In the beginning, some people got lucky. But in recent years, no one has gotten a bargain with me anymore. Among the group of people chasing me recently, the only one who can get a bargain with me is you, but you're not one of those kinds of people.</p>
<p>I have an impulse to tease people, but with you, aside from the most ordinary jokes, I can confidently say that I've never teased you once. Because you are sensitive, honest, intelligent, and refined, I am very respectful of you. It certainly exceeds the feelings of so-called acquaintances and reaches the level of friendship. This is certainly why I have harmed you.</p>
<p>I can't bear to hurt you, can't bear to push you further into confusion. It's not that all your true feelings have moved me. Your letter is precisely the opportunity for me to tease you. I now hate that you didn't meet me a few years ago. At that time, my habits weren't so bad yet. But it's impossible now. In my spirit and in my body, it seems I've become diseased. What do you still want from me? Of course, I won't just casually go with you. No, if you were to be insistent to the point of seeking death, I could definitely be with you. But what the outcome will be, it's absolutely impossible to predict. After much thought, it seems it's better to separate. I know that you will feel pain, and I will also feel a lot of sadness over time. But it's still better to separate.</p>
<p>Your estimations of my thoughts, if it were a few years ago, would have been very accurate. Although some of them don't match the facts, most are correct. Perhaps they are also correct for the average young woman. But not now, not for me. An objective estimation to completely coincide with the feelings of the person involved, I think it's practically impossible. I might as well tell you what I subjectively feel, and you must keep this a secret from the world. I trust your integrity and believe you wouldn't use this to retaliate against me or blackmail me.</p>
<p>A strong body like yours is what I need. A sensitive feeling like yours is what I desire. But a material environment like yours is what I can't be satisfied with.</p>
<p>What I seek now is material enjoyment. In other words, cars, mansions, pianos, phonographs, wireless telephones, wine, meat, bright lights, vibrant colors.</p>
<p>Sharp sounds, the servitude of humans and animals, and everything that can be bought with money to stimulate my nerves.</p>
<p>Lofty ideals cannot blind my consciousness. The flames of material things warm my soul. If you could provide me with that kind of woman, I would still have to act. If I still have to act, then those people needed for business, such as drama critics, authoritative journalists, and wealthy and influential long-term patrons, will still have to be socialized with. Given that I socialize as usual, can my nominal status as a married woman scare away their ambition to pursue me? Having become accustomed to romance, can I suddenly put on a straight face to everyone and reject requests beyond friendship? Even if my name is your wife, if my behavior doesn't improve, can you endure this kind of insult?</p>
<p>If my current savings have already reached the limit I've set, I would give up my career. If such a person wants me, I would go with you and not be afraid of your poverty. But my savings are only enough for one or two years of living. Can't I rest for a year or two and then go back to the sea? At that time, I'll have to say, "Why did I do this in the first place?"</p>
<p>My relationship with you also stems from business, from being a customer to being an acquaintance to being a friend. After we became acquainted, your clever mind has helped me a lot with the matching of outfits, the depth of expressions, the harmonization of music, and the arrangement of sentences. In other words, you have helped me a lot in business. To put it more elegantly, you have helped me a lot in art. If I left the stage life after going with you, most of your advantages in my eyes would be completely lost. You definitely wouldn't be able to excite me as you do now. At that time, I wouldn't be sure whether I would change my heart toward you.</p>
<p>Although I don't want a husband like you, I do want a lover like you. When I first met you, I thought you came with the same purpose as them. Later, I saw that you didn't. I thought you really loved art. Who knew you had an even bigger ambition: to completely seize me. This is truly something I didn't expect.</p>
<p>Do you remember the dozens of times we parted after a show? I told you to send me back. Several times you brought me to my door, but I pretended not to let you in. There were also several times you brought me inside my house but didn't let you into my room, didn't let you sit on my bed. All these were just to arouse your further requests. Who knew you would listen like a child, telling you what to do and doing it. At that time, I both loved you and respected you, but I also hated you: loved your intelligence, respected your honesty, hated your lack of understanding. Now I know that you didn't lack understanding, but rather that you saw the meaning in a deeper layer.</p>
<p>Now I'm clearly expressing to you that I can't be</p>
<p>your wife, I can only be your lover. If you are willing to be my lover, I am willing to provide everything I have to make you happy. Whether you want a month, a year, two years, however long you want to, whenever. Even if I leave this place, no matter where I go, as long as there is a chance to meet, you will always have the right to have me.</p>
<p>The difference between a lover and a couple is that they each are not responsible for the other person's behavior and personality. A sincere person like you, and all your life's ideals, are not suitable for an irregular woman like me. A romantic person like me, for business reasons, shouldn't have a solemn husband like you. If we are lovers, I believe we will always get along.</p>
<p>You might say, "Since you know that your behavior is irregular, won't you ever change it?"</p>
<p>Yes, I don't plan to change my behavior in the near future, because I don't have the concept of family prestige, and I don't have the responsibility to consider the reputation of my parents and brothers. And society isn't worth criticizing our behavior. It's even more unnecessary to talk about not being able to marry in the future because of irregular behavior. If I want to marry, there are many men who are waiting for me to choose. The reason I am like this is of course due to business, but I also enjoy it a little. According to my estimation, there are indeed some adult women who envy our kind of life, but they are suppressed by various social constraints and cannot realize their desires. Even if society hinders them a lot and supervises them strictly, in this bustling city, not only in the lower class, but even in families claiming to be upper class, how many women stay true to one man? I really don't believe it, but it's just that they have heavy doors and deep courtyards, and outsiders can't know.</p>
<p>This is my shortcoming, and it's the reason why I refuse to be your nominal wife. If you are willing to be my lover, you can stay with me for a long time, which is equivalent to being my actual husband. When you don't want to anymore, you can leave me at any time. How free and worthwhile is that? There's no harm to you in terms of economics and reputation, but it's beneficial to me.</p>
<p>I'm 25 years old now, and I'll do this business for at most ten more years. If you were to say that you could first be my lover for ten years, and after ten years, when I leave the stage life, we could officially marry, no, not ten years, as soon as I've met my savings limit, I'll leave the stage life. If you can condescend and be my lover, I believe I can work even harder to complete my plan in the shortest possible time. As soon as I nominally become your wife, I will immediately correct my behavior and be willing to be bound and supervised by you.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you wait for me for ten years. You're only 23 years old this year, and getting married at 33 isn't too late. During these ten years, I'll also subsidize you with a considerable amount of money, which is stronger than what you'd spend living with me. You can also get sexual satisfaction in casual relationships.</p>
<p>You might scold me for being shameless, but I'm not ashamed. I'm telling you my thoughts very honestly and sincerely. I know my weaknesses myself. I'm like a wild horse now, and I can't bear to be tied down anymore. If I intended to deceive you, I would agree to what you said in your letter now. After you've fallen into my trap, I won't worry about you not following me in the future due to the pressure of life. Although you are very sensitive, you lack experience. I believe you won't be able to see through my flaws for a while. By that time, I will definitely have a way to make you believe me without a doubt. Even if you get a slight whiff of something, you'll have to temporarily endure it because of your own reputation and face. Perhaps you'll even help me hide it. But I'm not willing to do that. I can't bear to harm a good soul, and my own scheming is too tiring.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have spent a lot of energy on me recently, and there should be some price. I'm willing to give you back a sum of money that's enough for you to maneuver with. You have many life plans, and you can use this money to spend. If you have a very good result in the near future and reach the level that I can be satisfied with, I will come to you at any time. At the same time, you should note that if you allow me this plan, I will also work harder in the future. But you may not want my money, thinking that it's unclean.</p>
<p>I am now in a state of contradiction. Since I don't want to be bound by you, I also want to make you my final destination. There isn't a woman in the world who doesn't want her man to be exclusively hers, but I now want to possess many men over time. This is another contradiction.</p>
<p>A man like you, I believe I won't meet again in my life except for you. If I lose you, even though there are many men chasing me now, I won't feel any embarrassment. When I'm old and my looks fade, I'll have to think of you. The older I get, the more I'll think of you. Your sincerity and honesty have indeed moved me.</p>
<p>Given all that, why don't I just fold my sails now and go with you? But how can I give up my unusual position now? Others think I'm a singer who excites millions, so they always think I must have something magical. I also use other people's psychology to use many magical things. In fact, to be honest, I'm as ordinary as the women of the world. I think many of the miracles of historical beauties are mostly passed down by changing times and circumstances, or they were arbitrarily laid out by several or one bored writer to satisfy their ideal pornography.</p>
<p>The many words you use to compliment me, I feel sad inside when I see them. I use this psychology to make others go crazy with their excessive compliments, but I'm not willing to tease you like that. You see me as too magical, which is no different from digging an unclosable chasm between you and me. I've told you many things above that are beyond your expectations and that you don't know. If it came from the mouth of a third party, you would never believe it and would even think it was a malicious insult. I'm telling you now in my own handwriting on paper, and you should believe that I am indeed an ordinary woman like the women of the world. There is no magic at all, and I lack many of the virtues that ordinary women should have. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's War Diaries</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>Regarding the French-Belgian area, I believe that after the Allied Supreme Commander obtains the consent of the three supreme commanders of the French, British, and American forces and the chief of staff of the Belgian army, he should be an advisor to the Allied governments.</p>
<p>The first and second items of the armistice conditions belong to military necessity, and the third item belongs to the guarantee of reparations. Are these guarantees sufficient to guarantee the reparations required by France and its allied countries, especially Belgium? If so, what will happen to these occupied areas after the reparations are paid? Will our army continue to occupy them, or will it secede from a part of them, or will it establish an independent autonomous country as a neutral buffer zone? Does the armistice completely preserve these issues? The Allied Supreme Commander should study these issues in detail with the governments of the countries concerned in advance. The armistice should give our army sufficient guarantees so that the conditions I put forward during the peace talks can force the enemy to submit.</p>
<p>For this reason, I should always have close contact with important personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should also often notify me of its opinions and the armistice conditions of the Allied governments. In this way, I can determine that the military guarantees and the diplomatic guarantees will not neglect one another, and I can also fulfill my responsibilities to France and the Allied governments.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Clemenceau in a letter, if he agrees with this idea, please notify me of who from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to contact.</p>
<p>I believe that the most important thing is to study the political conditions of the armistice in detail in advance to prevent future changes. The armistice is related to the cessation of large armies, and the main conditions of the peace treaty should be included in the armistice articles. What will the future changes be, so that we can avoid unexpected blows?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Clemenceau wanted to maintain the government's free action, so he refused to appoint important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to contact me in his reply letter on October 23.</p>
<p>In fact, the armistice conditions must be decided by the Allied governments, and the drafting of the articles must naturally be handled by the Allied governments.</p>
<p>President Wilson has submitted this issue to the Allied governments, and he has notified the German government to negotiate with the military advisors of the Allied countries. However, whether or not the armistice treaty is concluded, and the details of the conditions, must be completely decided by the Allied governments themselves.</p>
<p>The Allied governments have no reason to oppose President Wilson,</p>
<p>The principle of fourteen points as the basis for peace, but if necessary, a few points can be revised. If the enemy fully accepts the armistice conditions, the Allied governments cannot oppose the ceasefire, (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Sorrow of an Instructor</h3>
<p>— Zhu Hongxi</p>
<p>Because the instructor had just arrived at the school and was not yet very clear about the situation within, he felt somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>He asked his fellow townsman, Mr. Zhang, with utmost sincerity. He inquired whether students in the past had been interested in military drills, whether students could obey the orders of the military instructor and attend drills on time, and what attitude the principal and faculty held towards military training, etc. As a result, Mr. Zhang's answers were quite satisfactory to the instructor.</p>
<p>The instructor thought, this is a very good thing. Students can obey the orders of the military instructor, and can maintain discipline when attending military drills.</p>
<p>A burst of nameless joy suddenly erupted from within his heart.</p>
<p>School was about to begin, and faculty and students were gradually increasing in number. People were constantly coming and going in the dormitories and dining hall. Experience told him that the school was about to return to its state before the summer vacation. The instructor wore a gray Chinese twill military uniform, a diagonal leather belt across his shoulder, a dark gray military cap on his head, and black leather leggings on his feet. He strode around the school in high spirits, with a sincere and solemn expression on his face.</p>
<p>On the day school started, the instructor had no classes, so he quietly sat alone in his room reading the newspaper. He occasionally thought of his past monotonous life and felt satisfied with his current life. Finally, he could not help but harbor a hope for his future.</p>
<p>However, the instructor was a person trained in conscience. He was extremely opposed to using the guise of a military man to get promoted and make a fortune.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, the instructor began teaching according to the school's scheduled timetable. Before going to the drill ground, he first ordered the school worker to blow the bugle several times. He then moved towards the drill ground, holding the roll book. Arriving at the drill ground, the instructor quickly looked around, but could not see any students coming for drills. He then ordered the school worker to blow the bugle a few more times. When the bugle sounded, the double strikes of the class bell also rang. Only then did he understand that the students had not yet come to the drill ground because it was not yet time for class. After the bell stopped, the instructor saw a few students in short clothes running towards the drill ground. After about five minutes, more than ten people had gathered on the drill ground. The instructor opened the roll book and counted the names. As a result, less than one-fifth of the students had come to drill. This made the instructor somewhat suspicious, and a feeling of displeasure arose in his heart. However, the instructor thought again, school has not been in session for very long. Perhaps the students who did not come to drill were busy with other things and had not had time to arrive. A kind of hope surged up from his heart again. He felt relieved.</p>
<p>The instructor was a person who advocated saving the country with conscience. He was extremely critical of those soldiers who kept wives and concubines but failed to fulfill their duties. Once, he had openly expressed his opinions in front of many students, saying that the most hateful people in the country were those who only knew how to eat but did not know how to work, especially those who ate public funds but did not work for the public. Finally, he said,</p>
<p>He had been ordered by the central government to come to this school as a military instructor. He had to achieve excellent results in the military training of this school to be worthy of the central government and of himself. Otherwise, he would be extremely unwilling to do it. Rather than eating this kind of nominal meal, it would be better not to eat it at all... At that time, none of the students were not moved by the instructor's words.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, the instructor took the roll book to drill again. No, it was to the classroom. After the second bugle stopped, the instructor ran into Classroom No. 9. Walking into the classroom, the instructor felt somewhat doubtful again. Why were there so few people present out of more than a hundred? The instructor was at a loss. But the instructor thought, today is Saturday. Many schools do not have classes on Saturday afternoons. It is really inappropriate for the school to schedule this class on Saturday afternoon. They all did not come to class today, there is a reason for it.</p>
<p>Time passed day by day, and the instructor understood the situation of the school more and more each day. After two weeks, he learned from the facts. His courage, his hope, had gradually disappeared. He had begun to immerse himself in sorrow, disappointment, and negativity.</p>
<p>……………………………………</p>
<p>It has been almost two months since the school started, but the instructor's plans have still not been implemented. The instructor's hopes have still not been realized. The instructor is still as sad and disappointed as before.</p>
<h3>Everyone Prepare Yourselves</h3>
<p>— Gong Jingzhong</p>
<p>After the territory of our country in the Northeast, such as Shenyang, Yingkou, Changchun, Andong, etc., were occupied by Japanese imperialism due to our lack of preparation, the entire country, from top to bottom, felt a sense of shared hatred and wanted to kill them all as quickly as possible. Therefore, in these dozens of days, our compatriots, regardless of age, have been fighting for the cause of resisting Japan and saving the country. We will never give up until we recover our lost territories. Since this is the case, everyone prepare yourselves. Now I will explain it by category for the reference of my patriotic compatriots.</p>
<p>Soldiers 丨 Prepare fast guns and sharp cannons, heads, hot blood, to go to the battlefield to die.</p>
<p>Workers 丨 Prepare calloused hands and feet to rush to manufacture cannons, airplanes...all military supplies.</p>
<p>Literati 丨 Prepare to rack your brains and shed bloody tears, to write passionate and stirring articles.</p>
<p>Farmers 丨 Prepare hoes and plows, and go with the eastward-bound soldiers to immigrate to the Northeast and cultivate the fields.</p>
<p>Merchants 丨 Prepare to lose some capital, actively improve domestic products, and permanently sever economic ties with Japan.</p>
<p>Students 丨 Prepare to study hard on the one hand and actively practice military drills and charge into battle on the other.</p>
<p>Women 丨 Prepare to be comfort teams, relief teams, rear defense forces, and cooks. In particular, prepare to painstakingly educate children to become great citizens and not forget the great enemy of Japan.</p>
<p>Children 丨 Prepare abundant knowledge, noble cultivation, and healthy bodies to become good citizens in the future, so that China can become prosperous and strong, and avenge your fathers and brothers who died for the country.</p>
<p>Elderly people 丨 Prepare to stay in the rear and raise children.</p>
<p>Those with courage may as well bring out the spirit of "wrapped in horsehide after death," rush to the front with gray hair to kill a few Japanese, so that the enemy is a little timid and knows that the hearts of the Chinese people have not completely died.</p>
<p>Compatriots in the rear 丨 Prepare to starve, gnaw on grass and tree roots, and transport millet to the front lines, so that the soldiers are full and strong and can kill the enemy well.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese 丨 Prepare to raise a large amount of funds and send them back to serve the motherland.</p>
