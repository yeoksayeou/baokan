<p>中村事件之眞實背景一言以蔽之即爲日本傳統的大陸政策自濱口辭職。若　繼任總揆。在野之敵黨。乃益以（對華外交）與（滿蒙權利動摇）等爲攻擊之口實其他軍人政客。又從而和之。於是（對華外交强硬。）乃成爲一致之主張。吾人試一檢閱日本朝野最近之言論。如南陸相告誡軍人有云（……當此之時。奉職軍務者。當益固其奉公之誠。於敎育訓練盡其熱誠。期於完成本分之準備無所欠缺。）此數語實含有極重大之意味。如政友會森恪等視察鮮滿歸國報告。故謂（中日官民之對立形勢。極爲嚴重。）甚至宣稱（中國對日宛然瀕於交戰狀態。）其故作危辭以挑撥彼國人對華惡感。最爲顯明。如外交時報主筆半澤玉城近著（不安的中日關係）一文。謂（中日官民之行動。乃一種宣戰佈告。）并極力主張第二次中日戰爭。謂（此戰之目的。爲懲治中國之新軍閥與新政治小兒。）其言論之狂悖。直不知國際禮儀爲何物。而其武力對華之主張。則更公然提出。毫無忌憚。以環境之激盪。與四週空氣之包圍。而若槻首相七月十九日在民政黨東北北海道大會上演說。乃亦有（若果中國之措置有不法不當之事。則爲匡正計。當然用盡外交手段。努力到底。自無待論。且爲防衛國家生存起見。必當不顧任何犧牲。决然奮起）之激烈言辭。其所謂（不法不當。）即無異於不准中國自衛自固。而最後兩語。則弦外之音。更令人不言而喻。綜上而觀。則日本最近對華政策之轉趨於强硬。軍人政客武力主張之得勢。實爲無可掩飾之事實。而前此萬案韓案之接踵發生。更爲其蓄意挑釁之有力證據。迨此次所謂中村事件突然發生。日人乃更振振有辭。武力侵華之主張。更爲露骨。如八日日閣議决議。（……萬一中國方面故意遷延。或掩蔽本案之眞相。日本擬根據物質的事務的確證。立即採取自認爲正當之處置。）如南陸相於閣議散會後語新聞記者云。（……余已有斷然之覺悟不過現在暫時須看中國方面之態度如何。）如瀋陽日本總領事館宣　。（東北方面缺乏誠意。將訴諸實力解决。視第二次調查隊結果如何。倘仍無滿足之表示。中日間不免發生正面衝突。）其尤可注意者。則衝突之時期。日領館亦已預定爲本月二十五日。如一般政客謂。（日本對於中村遇害案及其他中日爭端。苟不取硬之立塲。則中國仍將進行所謂延擱之政策。中日兩國現待决之爭端。共有三百項之多。必須幡然改計。效法蘇聨。正式對華宣戰。乃能解决中日一切爭論。）而八日日金澤地方。更有飛機架。奉當地師本部命令。散發傳單。鼓動彼國人民感情。日關東軍首腦部。亦於八日派特務機關長土肥原大佐赴東京。與參謀本部接洽。積極備戰。民政黨八日開幹部會。極力主張對華外交强硬。并推定俵孫一等組織對華外交特别委員會。綜合上述日方對中村事件之言論與行動而觀。日人之故作超出事實以上之鼓吹與煽惑。實完全以對我東北積極侵略爲其背景。萬案韓案以至此次中村事件之接踵而來。其惟一目的。即爲挑釁。激使我國人忍無可忍。予彼方以藉口之資。蓋我國新遭洪水。舉國正忙於救災。無暇外顧。日乃乘我危難。下落井之石。步步進逼。企圖實行其大陸政策。司馬昭之心。路人皆知矣。不然。就使中村事件果眞。日方抑何不可敷陳事實眞相。以外交手段解决。而必故作危辭聳　并提出超出本案範圍以外之主張一若立即將有若何重大事態發生者。是其乘我。之危。趁火打刦。蓋已昭然若揭。而所謂中村事件之眞實背景。於此亦全體揭露。隱匿盡見矣。</p>
<p>日人磨刃霍霍。野心已露。未來時日。極爲可憂。我國人遭洪水。外迫强鄰。國步艱難。至斯已極。國人亟應覺悟。共謀所以自存。再諱疾忌醫。徒事掩飾。順受横逆。恐終非所以應變之道。尤有言者。日本中村等三數人。失踪事實尙未判明。即舉國沸騰。抗議紛至。而韓案慘殺我僑胞無數。則懸擱至今。迄無頭緒。慘案之交涉與僑胞之鮮血。同時凝冷。相形之下。實令人倍感弱國之眞無外交。而悲憤沉痛末由自止者矣。</p>

<h3>英國厲行減政加稅</h3>
<p>緊急預算提出下院</p>
<p>全國空氣頓呈緊張</p>
<p>政府採非常手段應付特殊環境</p>
<p>彌補不足尙可盈餘百五十萬鎊</p>
<p>▲路透社十日倫敦電政府减政案今夜發表、依此案之規定、政府得將所提出各種减政辦法、立即見諸實行、此案授權英皇得於此案實行一月個内、頒佈其認爲必要之樞密會議命令、以實施公共事業上之减政辦法、此案所特别提及之行政事件、爲樞密會議命令所可適用者、爲敎育·國民健康·保險·警察·失業保險·與道路等事、樞密會議之命令、無須國會核准、一經公佈即成法律、此種手續、英國甚罕行之、惟遇特殊環境始採用之、在目前時局中、爲迅速辦理起見、此種手續可認爲必要、若依尋常政府手續提出議、</p>
<p>案、則勢必延緩、且留有意阻撓之餘地、</p>
<p>▲路透社十一日倫敦電財政大臣史諾登昨在下院提出緊急預算案時所宣佈之積極减政與牲犧牲程序、有無反動、現尙未可確計、惟下院在預算案提出以前、所有之緊張空氣、昨夜已呈鬆動之象、晚間各報在國會外特發專刋、將財部之計畫傳佈於衆、國人現所談者、幾無一不爲預算案辦法、所得稅標準率之增高、各種特免之减少、將使一大部份人民大受打擊、從前所得無多、可免繳稅者、今後亦有納稅之義務、而目前納所得稅者、其中以中等階級恃薪水及、職業爲生者、最受影響、惟國人現顯然完全有作重大犧牲之决心、逆來順受、已成目前之流行語矣、</p>
<h3>國會之景象</h3>
<p>午後下院人極擁擠、爲前此所罕有、史諾登到下院時、民衆歡聲雷動、入塲時、政府派亦歡呼迎之、史起立發言、茲先聲明渠將施行其生平所未前有的最不令人愉快之工作、旋即展開其彌補國家大虧空之程序、史氏此次預算演說、誠英國從未有之最驚人預算演詞也、</p>
<p>數字之撮要</p>
<p>新預算案辦法中叚涉及之數字、可撮要於後、史諾登不僅言本屆財政年度中所剩數目内之入欵地位、且言及下屆財政年度之地位、估計本年度預算缺少七四·○○○·○○○鎊、其原因爲世界實業蕭索、稅收减少、内地稅收較預算减少六五·○○○·○○○鎊、關稅與國產稅减收四·○○○·○○○鎊、胡佛總統停付計畫下英國戰債之收入、又减少三○·○○○·○○○鎊、史諾登主張彌補上述短少、其法如下、减政二二·○○○·○○○鎊、還債準備金少提一三·七○○·○○○鎊、加稅四○·○○○·○○○鎊、合爲七六·二○○·○○○鎊、如是七千四百萬鎊之短少、可變爲一百五十萬鎊之盈餘、至於下屆年度根據目前支出與收入計之、將短少一七○·○○○·○○○鎊、欲彌補之、則辦法如下、减政七○·○○○·○○○鎊、還債準備金少提二○·○○○·○○○鎊、加稅八一·五○○·○○○鎊、共爲一七一·五○○·○○○鎊、</p>
<p>减政之詳則</p>
<p>政府發出白皮書、載預算案减政辦法之詳則、欲於全年内在國家支出中共節省七○·○○○·○○○鎊、各辦法中最引起政治爭論者、爲失業保險津貼基礎之變更、即此一項、年可省二五·八○○·○</p>
<p>○○鎊、敎育經費之撙節、連敎員减薪百分之十五在内、可得一○·三○○·○○○鎊、失業經費少發一成、失業津貼以六星期爲限、期滿後、經過考騐、否則不得再領津貼、此後停止借債以應付失業金之措施、其他减政、如閣員·議員·軍民、官吏之减俸、共得四·五○○·○○○鎊、閣員俸金每年五千鎊者减二成、議員年俸四百鎊者减一成、法官薪俸亦照此核减、國防軍兵餉悉照一九二五年以後入伍者之餉額照發、軍官俸金亦减至與生活代價相合之程度、此外軍費尙擬續减、共可省五·○○○·○○○鎊、警察經費亦可省五○○·○○○鎊、路政經費約省七·八○○·○○○鎊、殖民地發展經費明年以七五○·○○○鎊爲限、計省二五○·○○○鎊、英帝國推銷局經費亦裁去二五○·○○○鎊、</p>
<p>新稅之徵收</p>
<p>下屆年度内預計加稅收入須得八一·五○○·○○○鎊、其辦法如下、所得稅標準率現每鎊收四先令六便士、將來須收五先令、惟實業另有補償、即對於固定資產之折舊、加增其現有免繳額、藉以抵補其所得稅之加增是也、此外所得稅特免及特减辦法、將嚴格裁除、未婚者歲入不及一百三十五鎊、前可免稅、今則不然、惟歲入在一百鎊以下者、始得免稅、已婚者免稅限額、前爲歲入二二五鎊、今則减爲一五○鎊、兒童每年津貼、首生者、前爲六十鎊、今爲五十鎊、餘者由五十鎊减爲四十鎊、所得稅對於勞力所獲、則待遇較優、從前勞力所獲之工資、六分之一免繳所得稅、以二五○鎊爲限、今則改爲五分之一免稅、以三○○鎊爲限、附稅將加一成、以言間接稅、則啤酒一品特、加稅一便尼、進口烟草、每磅前徵稅八先令十便士、今改徵九先令六便士、其餘烟草、比照加徵、油稅每加倫增稅兩便士、娱樂稅照新章徵收、雖廉價座亦不免、最多者爲二便士、惟兒童票不收稅、</p>
<p>報紙之批評</p>
<p>史諾登之預算案、當然引起工黨这批評、其所提辦法在立法進行中、勢必處處受極劇烈之反對、今晨工黨機關每日　報大施攻擊、謂貧富犧牲不同等、並謂史諾登改變其生平事業所表示之途徑、受保守黨自由黨與銀行家之壓力、倒行逆施云、保守與自由黨報則謂擔負分配、畫平均之能事、貧富一律、納稅者定將以榮譽的解决方法昭示世人、雖有傷害、亦唯有受之耳、否則恐慌猶不僅此、辦法誠爲嚴酷、然在月前環境中、史諾登别無他法云、報紙詳論如此、昨晚預算案提出後、下院某議員語路透記者曰、姑進一杯酒無</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>接國外要電</p>
<p>俟其價漲、國人接受此嚴峻計晝之精神、已可由此語見之、保守黨因所得稅擔負甚重、亦覺惶駭、試以有子女二人之家庭言之、其人年獲薪俸五百鎊、從前付所得稅八鎊、今後則須付六十鎊矣、</p>
<h3>調換債劵之計畫</h3>

<h3>男子决賽</h3>
<p>▲鐵餅上海一隅、各項田徑運動、進步尙速、獨鐵餅一項、進步甚遲、抛來擲去、每次運動會中、終不能得良好良績、查此次全市運動會中、今日首先决賽之鐵餅一項、雖加入决賽者、有一十三人之多、但缺乏良將、查往日成績、以王季淮、陳寳球、曹裕、謝全和、羅傳賢、傅鴻興、五人爲較佳、惟王季淮、日前在曁南練習時、跑鞋釘傷脚背、腐爛多時、寸步艱行者將及兩星期、雖已完全復原、但久已缺練習、成績不免稍遜、Ｂiy　Boy陳寳球、向日成績、時佳時劣、興緻來時、三十四五米不爲希奇、興緻不來、三十米左右亦屬常事、此蓋以經騐不豐故也、近聞陳君、身染瘧疾、已非一日、故精力大减、今日能否出塲、尙是問題、其餘曹·謝·羅·傅四君、成績均不相上下、曹謝以資格較老、或可爭奪位置、惟聞羅君近日進步甚速耳、</p>
<p>▲跳遠在四十三人中、爭取决賽權者、不外王季淮·郝春德·陳公與·鍾蓮基·李琳·吳錦祺等六人·爭取錦標、以王季淮與郎春德較有希望、惟王季淮以足疾初愈、届時雖或能奪得優勝、但預料决不能如上半年在江大運動會中所跳成績陳·鍾·二君爭奪位置成績亦必可觀、不致與王郎二君相差甚遠、李君常能跳至六米二十左右、惜以身材關係、難有驚人表演、吳君足弓彈力甚佳、惟於跳遠時常易曲筋、以記者意見、吳君可放棄跳遠專意跳高攖取錦標、不知吳君以爲如何、</p>
<p>▲跳高加入跳高者、亦有二十五人之多、但預料在一米六十以前出局者、至少有五分之三爭最後之勝利者不出吳錦祺·李琳·顧彧三人吳李二局·均用霍拉菌跳法、自改用新規則以後、均感相當吃虧、二人比較、更以李君尤甚、顧君跳法資勢頗佳惜以體高關係、極難再有長進、吳君錦祺、於放暑假時、偕同江南隊北征、在北平與潞河對抗時、聞與李君仲三競跳第一時、僅差李君一級、致名列第二、是日李君之成績、爲一米八四、此推算吳君之成、至少亦有一米八十、如此則跳高之錦標吳君似較有把握也、</p>
<h3>女子决賽</h3>
<p>▲跳遠昨日在敎育局註册處、查全體女子報名單中、三分之二是女子體育學校學生、但統計女子體育學校學生、以百分數計算、不及全滬中等以上女先總數之十分之一、由此可見其餘如女學體育之不普及、此實本市女子體育之不景氣象也、至於女子各項田徑成績、在此幼稚時期、頗難預料、極易冷門獨出、以往日之女子跳遠成績、在上海市中、終以張蘋先、錢行素、陳運卿諸女士較有希望、惟記者極希望有驚人成績之新選手、在今日全市運動會中、將一般老選手打倒、造成新紀錄、并希此種消息、在本屆運動會中、一再聞之、</p>
<p>▲跳高女子跳高一項、在幼稚之女子體育中、其幼稚之尤者也、不云成績若何、即跳之姿勢、百中不能得一、走遍滬濱、未曾見得有優美之跳高姿勢、但在成績幼稚之本市中、以上半年中等學校女生組跳高之成績論、當推張寳瑾、楊志仁、孫曉霞、三女士爲較佳、因張·楊·孫·三女士曾奪得位置、張女士并以一米二六造成幼稚中之新紀錄、但此中狀况、極易改變、今日比賽、造成何等局面、實非記者之智力所能臆斷、惟願諸女士努力競爭、勝負不足論、成績之進步、最爲緊要、</p>
<h3>男子預賽</h3>
<p>▲百米預賽上海短跑健將、無不推重鍾連臺、郝春德、顧再平、周恩德、林光與、何德寳諸君、今日該六君、分列六組中預賽、名列前茅、可無疑義、惟滬江林光興君、前數日怱患腹瀉、至昨日雖漸漸痊愈、但已肌肉消瘦、精神萎頓、記者昨日、見滬江體育主任彭三美君、詢其意見、據云擬仍令參加預賽、觀其第一次預賽結果如何、看情形定奪、記者回憶前江大運動會時、光華王季淮君亦與林君同樣情形、當時感勸王君愛重身體、不必勉强參加、不料王君於兩日運動會中、連中三元、得跳遠、三級跳、標槍三項第一、標槍并造成江大新紀錄、有在塲觀賽者、笑曰、王季淮病挑安殿保、一槍打倒舊記錄、記者極顧林君今日能一如王君、病中做神行太保、</p>
<p>▲二百米預賽鍾、郝、顧、周、四大將、在二姓米預賽中、當可大出風頭、林光興君本可與四大將一較長短、惟以腹瀉之後、恐難與爭勝、惟有一後起之秀、曁南之曾榮忠君、堪爲四人之勁敵、試括目待之、</p>
<p>▲四百米預賽前萬國運動會時、一千六百米接力之中華隊隊員曾榮忠、何德寳、蘇祖卿、王健吾、四員大將在四組預賽中、可操左劵其中王君健吾雖以年齡較大已三十七歲、但其精神仍不减當年（十五年前）江蘇省運動會時威名赫赫時之王健吾、且其成績、亦有與年俱進之勢、但今年來練習雖勤、成績終不如去年之爲佳、想以年齡與精力之關係無能爲力者也、</p>
<p>▲八百米預賽八百一項、加入比賽者、多至五十七人、或云此中有四分之一、將臨賽不到、所到之中、又有一半不能跑完全程、故此項預賽極少精彩以成績論、以第一組中之陳行佩、第二組之邱陵如爲較優、其餘均屬平平、</p>
<p>▲千五百米預賽在六十三賽員中、記者敢言其中至少有一部份、係投機性質、其目的爲得一運動員徵章而加入比賽、並非爲求技術上之進步而加入比賽、是否如此且待今日預賽時點名證實、記者猜測彼等心理、其他運動不易濛混、惟有中　距離跑、如一千五百米、一萬米等、在第一第二　時、不論何人、均可追隨、至原力不能繼續時、即中途退出、或託言腹痛、或揚言脚痛、種種怪現象、無所不有、彼等至此、方以爲加入運動會之責任終了、穿好衣裳、掛着徵章、東走西跑、致滿布是等貨色、以往日情形亦有童子軍上前干涉、彼等無不曰我運動員也、向日習慣如此、惟今日將舉行之全市運動員因不用報名費、將因之而更甚、言雖如此、願加入一千五百米競賽者、切勿爲記者預科所及個個能到場競賽、且能跑完全程、夫千五百米爲上海最缺乏人才之一項運動、最好之成績亦終在四分三十秒左右與遼寗比較實相去甚遠、在四組賽中第一組以張琥根爲最有把握、第二組周斌極有希望、第三組陳行佩定能錄選、第四組邱陵如可操勝劵但記者深望各組均有新人才出現、勿讓老將長時佔美也、</p>
<p>▲中高欄預賽跳欄一項究屬非易、故加入比賽者不多、高欄僅十五人中欄僅十七人、高欄中以曹裕成績爲最佳、陶英傑、周紹文陳部章次之、春間萬國運動會時得高欄第一之陳國悛君、此次未曾加入、不知何故、中欄以陶英傑爲最佳、孫惠培陳部章次之、陳寳球或以疾病關係、不能參加是項運動、昨晚又探悉中欄記錄之保持者陶英傑君足患濕氣、不知於成績有無影響云、</p>
<h3>女子預賽</h3>
<p>▲五十米預賽張蘋先、盛璧、馬毓芳、司徒薇、四女士在各組預賽中最有希望奪標者、</p>

<h3>鮑爾講汽車之效用</h3>
<p>扶輪會聚餐中之席話</p>
<p>上海扶輪社前午在四川路海軍青年會舉行聚餐會、請美國汽車商會館爾演講汽車運輸之重要、略謂、美國在距今不久時、全國祇有汽車四輛、而其中一輛、尙係在馬戲場中作號召之用、今日則通國共有二千六百萬輛、竟比電話爲多、不難使全國人民、悉乘汽車、每五人一輛、於同一時間出發、任往邊遠小邑、無不通行、至於長途汽車、即遠如紐約舊金山間、亦已開行定期班、迅速不亞於火車、大都市中汽車間、竟有設在二十二層之高樓、用電梯升降者、跨河越江、則有特闢汽車隧道、補橋樑之不足、甚至如紐約閙市、以車輛繁　、刻正正籌築高架汽車道、備快駛汽車之通行、考美國汽車所以能如此發逹者、由於人民已得一新觀念、認識時間之重要、深知吾人一生光陰、耗於行（即衣食住行之行）者實占大部份、苟能節省行之時間、光陰便可多得、從事他種事實、吾人任做一工作、不能安坐而不行、今人作事、在求費最少之成本、轉得最大之功效、其所謂成本者、非僅指所耗之金錢、乃就勞力光陰等而總計之、故就結果言、在運輸方面、實以人力車耗費最甚因車資雖廉、乘車者苟以所行里程與所耗光陰並計、則成本實鉅也、此事可舉數年前德國製造汽車業爲例證、當時德國工值低廉、祇當美國工值六分之一、而美國製造之汽車、能與德國汽車競爭於市場者、因美國用機器製造、出貨十倍之速、成本自輕也、但欲於運輸方面、利用汽車、必須有良好道路、故築路尤爲發展汽車運輪之首務、幸汽車是生產的、倘有良好政策、不難助償築路之所費、例如通行汽車後、貧民可往遠處購致較廉之物、則因築路而所增之捐稅負担、不難於此中取償、築路經費、可發行公債、而以捐稅收入爲償還本息之擔保、中國今日漸有時間觀念、築路正在進行、旅客貨物、逐漸用汽車運輸、交通日便、光陰之浪費、當日見减少矣、</p>

<h3>五毛錢的總司令</h3>
<p>日本，東京一處有圖書館二十七所。規模大的有兩所：一爲東京上野帝國圖書館；一爲東京帝國大學圖書館。上野圖書館藏書六十七萬册。東大圖書館藏書六十萬册。這兩個圖書館比了巴黎國立圖書館之五百萬册，倫敦大英博物院圖書館之五百萬册，和華盛頓北美合衆國國會國書館之四百四十萬册還不免有小巫見大巫的樣子，但在文化貧窮的東方實在可以雄視一時了。東大圖書館爲美國煤油大王創立之洛氏基金會捐欵所建築，共費五百五十萬日金合華幣一千一百萬元。洛氏基金會捐欵四百萬日金，餘一百五十萬日金爲國庫支出。這個圖書館不許校外人閱覽。我得到洛氏基金會蘭安生介紹信，可以設法進去看書，但因回國期迫，没有充分受用。上野圖書館是公開的，只要出五分錢，隨便什麽人都可以進來看書。閱書人每天平均一千二百人。若有專門問題，可以費五毛錢買張研究劵進入研究室閱覽這樣不但該館自有之六十七萬卷書可以聽你調閱，館外的書，也可代你借用。這個辦法對於學術的研究可算是便利極了。我把這個意思告訴了一位朋友；他對我說：（你化五毛錢便捐得這個百萬卷書的總司令，是可以自豪了。）</p>
<h3>腦之重量</h3>
<p>— 胡星伯</p>
<p>腦爲神經之中樞。司掌吾人之一切活動。如五官百骸之動作。皆以腦爲原動力。據生理學之研究。謂人益聰明。腦益沉重。而其表面上之皺襞亦愈多。人雖不能就尙生存之人。而衡其腦之輕重。計算其皺文。不過就已死者解剖而測定之耳。</p>
<p>據研究所得。男子自五十歲至六十歳之間。某腦之重量最大。女子則反是。自二十歲至三十歲之間爲最重。又男子之腦比女子之腦重。以上調查世界各國莫不皆然。</p>
<p>茲更就世界各國人種之腦重量比較如下。</p>
<p>歐羅巴人種男一三六七瓦女一二○六瓦。馬萊半島人種男一三一九瓦女一二　九瓦。亞美利加人種（印地安）男一三○八瓦女一一八七瓦。亞細亞人種男二三○四瓦女一一九四瓦。亞非利加人種男一二九三瓦女一二一一瓦。澳大利亞人種男一二一四瓦女一一一一瓦。</p>
<p>以上乃就各人種而平均計算者也。茲又舉各國偉人之腦之重量誌之如下。</p>
<p>我國革命偉人孫總理之腦。其重量逈異常人。據解剖者發表。總理之腦。實比俄國之列寗重一瓦以上。蓋總理之腦重量爲一五○五瓦。而列寗則爲一五○四瓦也。</p>
<p>世界偉人之腦之最重者。爲俄國有名文學者都爾喀列夫。其重量爲二○一二瓦。日本之名首相（明治末年）桂太郎爲一六○○瓦。日本文學者夏目漱石爲一四二五瓦。歐洲樂聖蕭伯爾脫爲一四二○瓦以上特就死後經解剖者而記之尙有未經解剖者或超出以上記錄。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>就上所述則人種之優劣似屬先天的而非後天的。其實不然。腦之輕重純在運用與否凡物用則發逹。不用則退化。故腦之輕重。及皺襞之多寡。純在運用之程度而差别也。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>識字的魚德京柏林某大學中。曾設法敎授魚類識字。所用的方法。是將他們所愛吃的東西。裝在袋裏。有在袋上標以字母。</p>
<p>譬如最好的東西標以Ａ字。次好的標以Ｂ字。將兩袋放在一起。經過一番訓練。安們自會找Ａ袋吃。可知它們已認識了ＡＢ兩個字母。</p>
<p>▲坦克砲車的發明者歐洲大戰中最有名的殺敵致果的利器。除了毒氣外。要算是坦克砲車。據說最初由一位英國軍官史温頓副將Lieu-Colonel　E.D.Twinton向本國陸軍部提議。加工趕造。造成後便加入前線作戰。那時是在一千九百十四年十月。曾收得極大的效果。但是近來據德國一位發明家某氏宣稱。他在一千九百十三年間就繪成了一個坦克車的圖樣。曾在柏林陳列。所以發明權是應當屬於他的。（海客）</p>
<h3>地藏節雜談</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>廢曆七月底。俗謂之地藏節亦即佛敎徒所謂之地藏生日是也現雖舊曆蠲廢。然數千年來入人心之深。不能立時革除。相傳七月爲鬼月。小康之家。無不延僧人爲盂蘭之會。超度幽魂富豪之家。更無論矣。</p>
<p>俗傳地藏生日爲閏七月三十日。非閏月與小月皆非正日。其語甚趣。據釋敎人言。是夜幽冥。地藏敎主。親下地獄。查問苦惱。時寃魂。皆爲超度。且酆都城開放任其萍飄。因此作盂蘭會。使獄底幽魂。藏得享受甘露。而脫罪惡。其事雖屬迷信然宗敎之旨。大都如是也。</p>
<p>蘇地於地藏節日。家家戶戶。至夜間遍燃香燭。挿於庭中。或列門前。富家則以列星。頗堪悅目。謂之久思香。其舉行之初。乃蘇人紀念明初張士誠也。故名久思。是時士誠守蘇州。甚得民心。於七月三十日破城。士誠死之。蘇人哀之。遂有久思香之舉然不敢明言。祗僞托以香火點之。照徹幽冥黄泉之路。蓋是日酆都開放。幽魂徧泉壞也。迄今以訛傳訛。久思二字。漸失眞義。眞以爲由地藏節而舉行矣。</p>
<p>在清末時地藏節日之盂蘭勝會。極盡熱閙之能事。與三王會周王會等相捋。或且過之。會中除應有節目。如高蹺。臺閣。茶箱等之外。由扎鬼像。若黑白無常。大頭小頭。判官。牛頭馬面等等應有盡有。舉行之時。萬人空巷。其盛無倫。今則大都消滅。偶然得見。祗若士之鑼鼓少許之鬼像外。毫無興趣可言。此種盂蘭會之雛形。亦只海上得見。内地則懸爲迷信禁例矣。</p>
<p>蘇地於地藏節之夜。久思香外復以紙錠焚於門外。及後門外家家如是而乞丐則大得其利。持帚執箕。列戶掃畚箔灰售與商人。在十餘年前。每人可得十餘斤。今則祗數斤矣。故乞丐至地藏節日。莫不喜形於色。以有意外之收入也。</p>
<h3>蜜蜂助賑記</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>海上畫社林立。惟蜜蜂晝社。爲名畫家鄭午昌李祖韓孫雪泥錢瘦鐵等所組織。入社者逹二百餘人。頗占一部份之勢力。社友中之最負盛名者。如謝公展張善孖馬企周賀天健熊松泉王師子葉渭莘馬萬里謝之光胡若思馬孟容等二十餘人。惟自鄭午昌投筆從軍後。蜜蜂畫報。亦因之而櫊淺。社務進行。無形中爲之停頓。上月鄭自第八軍軍次請假回來。而錢瘦鐵又自東瀛歸國。蜜蜂同人乃設宴於陶樂春。爲鄭錢兩君洗塵。兼商徵集畫件助賑。入座錢君舉杯謝同人。即提議集畫之種種辦法。孫錢兩君擬認墊開旅館費。邀請合赴同人。咸來合作十天。朱蓉莊以徒費巨資。恐無佳品。請各人簽字。認畫若干件。衆贊成。乃當塲親筆簽字認畫者。如謝公展賀天健王師子馬孟容錢瘦鐵孫雪泥葉渭莘胡若思等。各畫二十件。馬企周熊松泉鄭午昌朱蓉莊龔鐵梅張善孖等。各畫十件。李祖韓沈子丞謝之光畫五件。顧吉　十件、統限十五日繳件。得有餘閒。每夕在崇法寺合作。以補不足。衆議决通過。比及席散。已鐘鳴九下矣。</p>
<p>▲出版界消息　本埠上海畫報重加整理。添聘名記者數人撰述及特約攝影。煥然改觀。革新號已於九日出版。用乳白銅版精印。十五日起。加印捲筒紙一種。備另售。銅版紙專供定閱。聞定閱全年者。尙有書劵五元贈送。捲筒紙全年二元。亦得書劵兩元云。</p>

<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>團城</p>
<p>往年車駕在西苑。各國使臣覲見必於承光殿。殿建圑城之上。自掖門拾級而登。平臺數畝。密甃花瓶。　宇軒昻。牕櫺洞豁。近挹北海之波光。遠浮西山之嵐翠。貝闕瑶宫。眞吾國建築所獨具之美也。按其體製。古所恒有。故籍中所謂宫右爲臺以備非常者。近代稀復築臺。意必胡元不擅此技。北京宫闕規模皆沿元舊也。明代諸帝尙常召見平臺。清宫惟團城足當此號。若瀛臺則實非臺也。余於民國十二三年常上直於此。朝夕攬其勝概。尤愛庭中古栝。栝之爲狀。白鱗碧鮮。虬幹疎陰。葉似松而稍細。其姿態遜松之奇傑。而秀雅則遠過之。其中最大者一株。傳是金源遺植。旁列稍幼者十餘。歷年以此地爲公廨。厮役無知。薫以烟火。頗有亡者。致爲可惜。余嘗撫繪此樹而系以詩曰。過眼興亡八百春。珍臺叢樹尙嶙峋。金源豈憶承平事。玉罋同留刦後身。枉爲清陰留俗客。若廻池水浣流塵。猶應悔向人間老。未共盤龍柱作薪。詩中之玉罋。指元世祖所制之酒罋也。元代大朝會必置於正衙。其後淪於西華門外眞武廟中。俗呼玉缽庵。乾隆十年乃以千金易之·移庋殿庭。覆以石亭。遍鏤御製。及諸臣和詩。罋爲黑玉所成。隨其天然形態。微加彫琢。容酒數石。斯實歷史上有數之珍物。至殿中所供白玉佛。嵌以寳石瓔珞。俗人每艷稱不已。不足與此並論矣。北人不識栝檜二字。呼曰白皮松。經年望之若負霜雪。郊行亦見之。南人輒詫爲奇觀也。</p>

<h3>丈夫的妻子（十一）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>你想娶個省儉持家的妻子，你爲什麽不娶蘭珍！我嫁给你，爲的要丈夫供給我的生活費。我所用的，都是必需要的生活費，你連這一些都肉痛，你把我殺了，或者休了，我便不會再向你要錢用了，你有本領，你快幹啊！否則我不是蘭珍，旣不會哭，更不會自殺，你一生有多麽的累受着呢。你枉爲了一個男子，外面什麽交際都不要去，你給掙着面子在外面交際，你反把臭話賴我，我可不答應！你說，我和經伯幹了什麽醜事？我和你向經伯去對質！伊說着，眞的來拖陳先生，陳先生正坐在隻小杌子上發怔，氣得全身都顫了，没防到伊用力地一拖，便跌了下來。他究竟還有一些男子氣慨，他站起了把右臂洒掉了，順手把妻子推着，伊脚裏没站穩，也跌在地下。伊站了起來，明知要是使力氣，是比不上男子，祇有用桌子上的東西來丢擲。茶壺，茶杯。金魚玻璃缸，花瓶，香烟碟子，什都擲破了。</p>
<p>（我祗說了一句，你却嘮叨着一大堆，這樣子丢擲東西，還成什麽體統！你給我安份些吧！）</p>
<p>（我什麽事不安份了，才要受你斥駡，你給我憑證，作這様侮辱我，我决不和你甘休！）</p>
<p>他們在屋子裏吵嘴，李先生也聽得了，走過去想敲開了門，去勸勸：但是他又聽得陳先生吵嘴，正提着他的名字，心虚不敢去。他知道陳夫人是很圓通，對於男子們晚上回家的遲晏，决不生問題、所以對於蘭珍，是並不十分表同情：但是陳先生却女性化，處處暗中帮助蘭珍。我家庭裏的不安，也許都是陳先生說了壞話而造成。李先生這麽想、越想越恨陳先生。對於陳夫人，却格外的崇拜。</p>
<p>他爲避免家庭失和起見，不得温慰他夫人，他便措了這緣由向蘭珍說：（你聽！他們在吵嘴，東西都砸碎了，不知是誰砸的？你身子好些麽？去勸勸他們！）</p>
<p>（我頭痛，不能起身：你去！）蘭珍忍耐着好久，不曾開口說話，而現在却說話了。李先生知道伊旣開口，便是伊息怒的表示，心裏定了下來。</p>

<h3>銀根忽然加緊</h3>
<p>▲市塲概况昨日銀洋市氣、釐價仍然彷彿、惟銀拆特殊加緊、究其由來、以勢理所趨、未便明白宣布即金融界方面、亦鮮有知者、總以目前天災人禍、商業上影響尤巨、就事實上及形勢觀察、本月份之銀根上或能較昻於上月也、亦未可料云、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分五厘一毫二怱半、午市略好一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分五厘二毫半、（銀拆）早市一錢五分、午市一錢六分、較前日突昻八九分、銀行掛牌六分、劃頭加水亦有一錢五六分行市、緊鬆現狀、較前日大有霄壞之隔矣、</p>

<h3>證劵鹽稅念捲暴漲三元餘</h3>
<p>其他亦漲二元左右</p>
<p>成交二千八百萬元</p>
<p>昨日公債市况、期貨以價變動甚烈、成交益多但現貨則依然不振、至各債價之趨勢、忽起重大反動、其漲勢亦烈、　晨初一盤、市塲人心看好、買進轉暢、後人心益見興奮、空戶補進及乘低投資收購、勢愈踴躍、求供形勢大相懸殊、各債價乃一致暴騰後市一盤、趨勢略和、然仍維持堅俏狀態、結果鹽稅十月飛漲三元五角半、其九月期及二○捲各漲三元餘、其他亦多漲二元左右、惟整六關稅九六僅約好半元、又現以近無交易、價多趨跌云、計現貨交易廿萬九千元、期貨上午兩盤約有二千萬、後市一盤八百十餘萬、合計二千八百十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗花仍在互擯中</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、毫無榮辱可分、海外花紗狀况不脫悲觀之狀、所以投機家抛空心思未絕、全無抵補之念、然多頭方面、意　亦十分堅决、故雙方擯力甚烈、至於現紗銷路益覺冷靜、各帮均無大量交易發現、然新抛者、以底盤關係、殊覺缺乏耳</p>

<h3>棉市暫告定局</h3>
<p>棉市暫呈平定之局、蓋以國内生產荒歉、執貨者均觀望而無套賣之念、故市氣尙帶硬一步、惟美棉情形十分悲觀、日商抛賣未絕、投機家大數傾向抛出、午後以金價尙堅、天氣又現惡劣之象、人心驟然轉緊、不過世界棉市、乃積重難返也、▲漢標午後　　　緊、交易所漢標前市開盤美棉雖跌、然塲中賣氣未熾、各月微漲五分至一錢、午後市况又緊、各月又漲五分、成交統計五萬一千四百担、查賢出大豐一千七百担、源大四千二百担、長和一千二百担、大昌成三千三百担賡豐一千四百担、買進益昶六千担、泰興三千八百担、愼昌一千五百担、振大一千四百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食米市到稀銷旺</h3>
<p>▲南市昨日來源受申市跌價之影響、漸漸落稀、城鄕店胃更覺活動、客方亦以連日頻跌、且此批運申成本浩大、故皆扳售、厚粳行情復硬二尺、薄稻積貨稍有、寗胃呆滯、本街去路仍不振、形勢提起一角、蘆洋尖及陰化貨色寥寥、價無上落、新粳來貨轉稀、胃納尙連形勢穩定、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日西路來船十號、河存亦少、本街店交以天又小雨、各路水災消息頻傳、人心向上、厚粳中次二種、又增二角薄早稻隨到隨銷、形勢跟起一角零、新粳到銷二敵、形無榮辱、洋蘆尖到頭亦薄、客胃仍細本街頂貨尙活、價亦昻起角許</p>
<h3>洋客秈價跌銷活</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、因連日去路不旺、市面疲落、昨客帮仍無問訊、而來源續有、本街實戶與團戶趁此機會、撳價收買、價雖下跌、銷化反見活動、計開出小絞米八百包、價十三元二角、敏黨二百包、價十三元○五分、一號西貢路貨五百包、價十四元半、均比前市小六七分至一角半不等、台州米亦見帶軟、開出五百包、價十三元一角半至十二元九角、小絞九月份期貨售開五百噸、價六兩三錢、而售出甚多、後市亦有望小之象云、</p>
<h3>粉市漲後復平</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份均呈盤旋之局、然洋麥報漲一二角、廠家因現粉動銷、在市收補甚勤、而北洋實銷客戶除抽裝現粉外、又復注意期粉之吸收、因此各月份市面一致步高、較前日收市價漲起一分半至二分不等、後有一部份廠家及多頭回售、行情乃見漲而復平、但最後收市價九月份仍大一分二五、十月大半分、十一月大一分、十二月一·二月各大一分二五云、</p>
<h3>期麥新多紛起</h3>
<p>昨日開市後、因麵粉動銷、洋麥報漲、市上空氣均爲買勢所漫迷、而現小麥行情雖疲、廠胃反見活潑、因此引起新多頭之收買、下年開盤後、各月份一致上升、本月份因市上籌碼减少、尤見較佳、結果本月份大四分、十月份大一分、十一月份大三分、十二月份大二分、一月份大三分、二月份大二分現麥開開三千五百包、福州麥三兩六錢一分、東臺三兩六錢鎭江麥三兩五錢七分、太倉麥三兩五錢半、安慶小粒麥三兩一錢四分、均由福新收入、申大較辦進上月底交易所交割麥六千包、價三兩六錢七分至三兩五錢七分、</p>
<h3>疋頭薄象皮雨布驟漲三錢</h3>
<p>雨衣布市銷近來極形活躍、零疋整箱俱有成交、惟魚皮裏子薄雨衣布交易較少、蓋多嫌價貴、一時不原辦進、昨元藏藍灰象皮裏子雨衣布暫通一律售三兩五六錢、頭號　尤爲軋缺莓碼喊售三兩八錢半、與上月份相比較、頭二號約漲三錢一碼、開水美及其他各色雨衣布則無大上落、雙面仍售六雨六七錢、單面若泰和·德記·洪盛·正昌等諸牌、統售五兩二錢二分五厘、</p>
<h3>糖市新貨粗砂白開一千袋</h3>
<p>太古糖下檔貨缺轉俏</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊·古巴現糖價爲一·四三七五、比前電升三一二五、紐約期糖九月份一·三九、一·四二、升二分、五月份一·四七、亦升一分、爪哇現糖價七·七五、期糖各月份七·六二五、俱乏升沉、公會劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白、市氣殊平交易零落、新貨十一兩六錢、陳貨十一兩四錢油袋十一兩二錢半、最次至十兩○九錢半、二十號中砂白十一兩一錢、新貨十一兩二錢半、市象亦各平定、太古車糖、Ｂ嘜十一兩九錢半、要手沉寂、市且萎弱、下檔貨缺、市則轉俏、ＤＹ嘜十一兩八錢二分半至八錢半、ＨＸ嘜十一兩七錢半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩四錢二分半、Ｈ嘜十兩○四錢半、出戶殊缺、趨勢頗挺、號盤有錦發號售開新貨粗砂白一千袋、價十一兩六錢、市殊不奇、但以新貨到申後、號盤現貨成交之第一聲云、</p>
<h3>五金銷塲清淡如故</h3>
<p>▲市場概况昨日五金市面、毫無振作精神、形勢十分滯鈍、蓋北帮牛莊·營口諸帮雖微見採辦而長江一帶仍因水患無活潑氣象、而本街廠家點綴、亦因存貨充斥、殊無收吸胃口、故市面之清淡、依然如故、</p>
<p>▲定貨交易、邇來洋行家之定貨交易、堪云毫無、蓋本埠市面、均疲於供過於求、因是各家均無購訂者也、</p>
<p>▲進口貨旺近來各貨進口之多、爲三年來所未有、如馬口鐵·洋元·竹鋼條·平白鐵·法西釘等均充滿於各堆棧、查馬口鐵一項、足有半年之銷場、而洋元·竹節鋼等亦有三四月銷塲而有餘、倘往後再源源而到、恐更將江河而日下、</p>
<h3>絲茶黄白廠經法銷難</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市仍難進展、查黄白廠經、美銷仍無起色、僅法莊乘機補空、惜開價不漲、成交難暢、昨祇信孚等進滬白廠經五十包、開利進川黄廠經二十包、價仍堅挺云、</p>
<h3>滬絲廠又開十餘家</h3>
<p>蘇浙絲業公債發行已逾一旬、各埠絲廠商赴公債基金保管委員會、具結領取債票者、已逹十之九强、各廠領得公債後、紛紛籌備復工、除前已開工之十餘廠外、現又有大來等十餘廠、於本星期中繼起工作、現計全滬單雙宫絲廠開機者、計單宫絲廠四十七家、雙宫絲廠六家、日内當續有增加云、</p>
<h3>大批日茶在滬銷售</h3>
<p>日本緑茶、近來已有大宗裝運來滬銷售、華商完全無人銷受、聞英莊協和洋行、因其茶價低廉、業已購進五千箱、預備與華茶合堆、運往國外銷售云、</p>

<h3>雨傘</h3>
<p>— 雯卿</p>
<p>在四季皆夏的島國裏、午後濛濛的陰雨、好像一個詩人的靈魂歡喜沉醉在美妙的幻想中一樣、紙油雨傘就成了那些忙着奔走生活的人們的寵愛之物、那些被金錢驅使的商人、在三個多月的雨季中、也很考究的製造出一種很精緻的雨傘來供給人們的使用、就是一種普通的雨傘、也是油光光的有三四種剌目的顔色、尤其是西城初級中學秋雲女士的一把雨傘特别精美、特别好看、聽說是她的爸爸在歐洲一個繁華的都城買回來給她的、她的學校距家裏很近、她是早去午回、午去晚回、唯有在三個多月午後的雨天、怪討厭的、每天她到學校裏去上課、一把美麗的雨傘、好像她的良朋好友一般地追隨她的足跡、不知是什麽時候起、這把美麗的雨傘已深深的刻在物理敎員張先生的心板上了、</p>
<p>那位頑固的校長、對於青年敎師和女學生的中間、打成了一層厚厚的墻壁、不許男敎員與女學生談話、除了上課以外、但也不怪那位校長這樣嚴格、因爲是那些僑生的腦筋太陳腐了、他們還是和十八世紀的思想一樣的、也常常在談慈禧太后垂簾聽政的故事、但慈禧太后的人格究竟怎樣、他們還是不知道、男敎員來敎女學生、也認爲是舊禮敎的叛徒、他們心驚胆戰的把女兒送到學校裏讀中國書、差不多要校長寫一張保單在他們的手中才放心一樣、人們的口本來是很毒惡的、若是被人家吹了一點什麽風聲到她們家長的耳中、不但是敎員的飯碗不能保全、就是校長的位置也根本摇動、本來在那層層壓迫的殖民地敎書根本是不容易的、有一次、荷政府在一個學校裏檢查書籍與課本、在一個學生的作文簿上檢查出了有（革命）兩個字、就把那改作文的敎員捉去關了三個月、便逐出境了、同時在另一個學校、有一位男先生把一個未滿十二歲的女孩兒呌了一聲（小妹妹）、也被校董辭退了、張先生有點害怕遭同樣的不幸、把他自己找來的痛苦、緊緊的藏在心靈的深處、他的面色一天一天的蒼白、人也一天一天的消瘦、他們同事們還以爲他患了貧血病、催他請醫生診治哩、恐怕世間上没有一個醫師、會有這樣高妙的手腕來醫治他吧、</p>
<p>雨傘的主人丨秋雲女士那雙水晶珠的眼睛、與一根葱的鼻子、就是引燃張先生心頭情火的原料、他本來是個態度冷靜的青年、他的心中不知怎樣燒起了洋水與海水都不能淹滅的情火、因爲環境的惡劣、但他無論如何都没有方法可以把他心頭的火燄爆發出來、因此、苦悶、憂愁、煩惱、無卿等、都和衷共濟的地向他微弱的心靈進攻、加以一種殘忍的相思、也無情的蹂躙他、他已經許多次數不能拒他的夢想、有時他堅絕的拒絕誘惑、可是誘惑更强、而他比平日更弱了、</p>
<p>他本來不愛吸香烟的、現在常常可以看見香烟在他的鼻管中放出濃密的烟霧、他想把閒愁化作青烟消散在無際的天空、可是烟霧還是團團轉轉地圜繞着他自己、這種長長的烟雲、似乎籠罩了他灰色的命運、他好像没有方法可以逃出來一樣、</p>
<p>在一天大雨如注的午後、他憑窗默坐、但誰不知道他的心中在想些什麽、在他宿舍的前面、是一排深緑的香蕉樹和椰子樹、牠們者涙水汪汪的呆立陰沉的天幕之下、他那雙羚羊般的眼睛、穿過椰葉縫裏、可以看見馬路上的行人張着雨傘在大雨中經過、他不禁又聨想到秋雲女士那把美麗的雨傘了、他寂寞的心兒、一時又沉没在悲哀的夢想中、窗外一種雨打笆蕉的聲音、好像是無情的冷彈子强烈地擊在他的心版上一樣的疼痛、他的四周似乎布滿了恐怖的空氣、他的眼涙也莫名其妙的陪着窗外的愁雨一般的落下來、他從衣袋裏摸出一條白絹手巾、輕輕地搽乾了頰上眼涙、又燃起火些抽着香烟、因爲抽烟是他唯消遣的方法、烟霧充滿了一間低矮而光線又不十分充足的屋子、他一邊抽烟、一邊在屋子裏踱來踱去、目光死死的釘在地上、一種無紀律的思想、像泛濫的洪水一般的在他的在他的腦中逆流着、他又横倒在床上、呆呆地望着白色的帳頂出神、忽然一朶未滅的香烟灰落在他的左頰上、竟燒了一粒黄豆大小的疤痕、但他自己好像還不覺得有這會事的一樣、他的神經錯亂、已經到了什麽程度、也可想而知了、</p>
<p>那天他的課上完了的時候、回到宿舍睡在床上修養他那疲倦的精神、一種熱烈的幻想在他的腦中盡量地飛馳的時候、忽然隔壁房子裏的席女士發出一種呼喚僕人的聲音來、</p>
<p>（仁娜、仁娜、快來替我把秋雲小姐的一把雨傘送到學校裏去、這是我剛才借過來的、快些、她要回家了、）</p>
<p>他聽見這種聲音的影子中夾着秋雲的芳名、他即刻從床上跳起來、三步當作一步跑出了門外、他看見那柄美麗的雨傘已被那個粗魯的僕人握在手中、他拚命的趕到門外呌着、</p>
<p>（仁娜、仁娜、我要到學校那邊去的、這雨傘我替你帶過去好了、）</p>
<p>（不、這是秋雲小姐的雨傘、席先生要我送過去的、）</p>
<p>（我知道的、我替你交給她就得了、）</p>
<p>他接過了這把雨傘、緊緊地握在手中、好像是握着他自己的生命、他走出門外之後、他才發現自己的身上僅僅地穿着一件白色襯衫、與一條短褲、他平常本很愛漂亮的、但這時候他什麽也不管了、只是掽命地向學校那邊奔去、他那雙羚羊眼珠在學校的周圍打量了一下、但不見秋雲小姐的影子在他的眼中發現、登時一種失望束緊了他的眉頭、他只是把一柄可愛的雨傘輕輕地竪在辦公室的一角、便跑到那扇窗門外去看、原來秋雲小姐還在課堂裏埋頭伏案做作文、當時一種莫名其妙的快樂從他的腦中升起、把一種失望的悲哀却消滅無痕了、他木偶似的站在外面痴痴地等待着、他的心中暗想、他想藉着交雨傘給她的時候、鼓着勇氣把這把雨傘交在她的手裏、他畢竟鼓着勇氣、走到她的跟前去、輕輕地問了她一聲、</p>
<p>（密司王、你的作文起了嗎、好快、你午後四點鐘到學校裏來嗎、……呵、這是你的雨傘、是席先生請我替你帶過來的）</p>
<p>（謝謝、先生、）她行了一個鞠躬禮、低着頭、接過了她的雨傘、夾着書包從綿綿的細雨中回家去了、他失望的目光、只得隨着她那苗條的背影送去、</p>
<h3>獻技</h3>
<p>— 朱子韋</p>
<p>星期六的下午、擁着很多人在操塲的裏外、</p>
<p>彧穿得較平時齊整、他立在操塲的入口、向着來處注目地看着、烏黑的眼珠在黑臉上閃爍、會覺是一種雋妙神秘的、其實多半因爲注意了彧、大家是擁着門前指着說、</p>
<p>（彧、今天又要跳高了、）</p>
<p>授與的印象是這般深、大家爲的是他、自某次傷足後、就不曾見到他在這操塲上練習過一次、就是過去不久的萬國賽、他也不曾預備、雖然他是不怎樣看重、但他在萬國賽是仍舊得到一個位置、他自己說那次是不幸而落得第四、因爲疎忽了的緣故、全運會之前、在這操塲練習、朋友們是以爲加緊用功、是想早看他的表演、</p>
<p>當彧脫去外衣見了淺藍的背心、深藍的短褲、並露了一雙黑亮的手臂和大腿、筋肉是凹凸得像羅馬將軍的偶像、拿現化的眼光看、有着莊健的美、眞的、我說得不陳腐、肌肉的暗示是這般英武、但也有使你懷欵地方、懐欵到他不能和碩大的洋人比逐、短小的身材、不信是能比洋人跳得再高、</p>
<p>跳高開始時、他是飛燕一般輕捷、紅鯉跳水般自然、姿勢是優美、兼了當一跳時身體一顫、說是更會高升、經過幾度跳躍、他在斜面側着、飛向竹桿的正中、當身體離了地面、脚是反上了、高過他的頭、你會替他躭心、不討好些說、豈不要跌死、說也神妙、脚過了桿、又反正了、跌死的姿勢、人說是地心的吸力、從脚底吸起、我說或者這樣、</p>
<p>跳圍是越圍越小、尤其立在前排的小孩想走前看親切、</p>
<p>（小弟弟立開些、讓他跳再高的看、）彧的朋友黄、他照料着塲子說、</p>
<p>（大家看、喂、是一米七五了、）立在跳架的曹報告、</p>
<p>喂的一聲後、就引起大家注意、由曹的視綫轉到曹的視處、奇怪、那理來了一位蜜斯、没有見過、這樣、以後觀者、是更忙着在空的時候、就得移視綫看她、</p>
<p>一米七五過去後、往後是不曾再跳、</p>
<p>散了後、彧是没有看見、</p>
<p>××籃球隊裏綽號强盜的陳說、</p>
<p>或爲什麽跳高、是爲的給她看、是獻技、）</p>
<p>（她是誰、）一個人問、</p>
<p>（……）</p>
<p>（喔、獻技……）我說、</p>
<p>（强盜是憶測的、曹的報告也有可欵、）歸時我默想、（初秋是滿含着春的温柔的意味、春是夢樣的、人是需要依變、眞是、初秋是像春一樣、）</p>

<h3>Gu Zhutong Arrives in Hengyang to Preside Over Military Affairs</h3>
<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Armies Declare Intent to Enter Hunan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Daily News Agency Report: Since the Guangdong-Guangxi armies arrived at the Hunan border, the Central Government, to protect Hunan's defenses, decided to dispatch troops to central Hunan for defense. In addition to having telegraphed Yunnan and Guizhou provinces to send troops, it also dispatched Gu Zhutong, the Chief of the National Government Guard, to Hunan to preside over all military affairs against the Guangxi army. Mr. Gu telegraphed the headquarters on the 11th, stating that he had already arrived in Hengyang. Although the Guangdong-Guangxi armies have actions to invade Hunan province, they are an inept crowd and easily defeated. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Jian telegraphed his Beijing office on the 10th, stating that the 8th Division of the Guangdong-Li army and the 4th Division of the Xiang army, totaling over ten thousand men, are concentrated in Shaozhou. The 7th Division of the Li army, under Huang Yanzhen, with over six thousand men, is concentrated in Lechang. Each soldier carries two hundred rounds of ammunition, two hand grenades, and dry food bags. Their luggage includes camp equipment, marching tents, and medical stretcher teams, as well as communication radio teams, suggesting a long expedition. The advance units of Huang Yanzhen from Lechang, about two regiments, have already entered Jiufengtang Village, and the remaining troops are continuing to follow. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) A telegram from Dong'an on the 8th stated that, according to intelligence reports, the rebel forces near Jiekou to Quanzhou have not made any reckless moves recently. There are no heavy troops deployed at Longhu Pass. On the Huangsha River-Kuzhu line, only the independent regiment of Zhou Fu, under Tan Lianfang of the Guangxi rebel's 24th Division, is present, with approximately two hundred rifles. Tan's division headquarters remains stationed in Quanchuan without moving. The 22nd Division of Li Pinxian's rebel forces is advancing towards Quanzhou from Guilin. It is rumored that the 19th Division under Liao Lei has moved west from Guilin. The Wu Qiwu Division under Zhang Fakui remains stationed in Pinggong, with no sign of departure. Furthermore, according to defecting soldiers from the rebel forces, for the past two months, the Guangxi rebels have been spreading rumors of invading Hunan every day, but in reality, they are only ordering various mixed troops and newly formed bandit armies to continuously make a show of force at the Hunan border. In secret, they are moving their main forces towards the border area of Quan (Zhou), Guan (Yang), Fu (Chuan), He (Zhou), and the Guangdong-Guangxi border. It is rumored that they are following secret orders from Wang Jingwei and Li Zongren, plotting to seize Guangdong. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan, concerned that the Guangdong-Guangxi armies are concentrated in Guilin and have the potential to invade southern Hunan in multiple directions, specifically telegraphed Zeng Yiding, the commander of the torpedo fleet stationed in Hankou, to send warships to Hunan to scout enemy movements. Zeng telegraphed back stating that he had already dispatched warships to inspect the Changsha and Hengzhou area. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The southern part of Jiangxi is peaceful, and the Guangdong army has not shown any significant activity. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Urges Merchants to Resume Business</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Garrison Headquarters held a meeting with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and various merchants on the 11th to discuss price stabilization and the resumption of trade. After Ye Peng reported, it was decided to establish a Provisional Committee for Evaluating the Prices of Daily Necessities and to urge merchants to endure hardship and resume business. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Plans to Issue Post-Flood Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>With a Fixed Amount of Six Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Hankou) Wu Guozhen and Finance Minister Song agreed to have Hubei issue six million yuan in post-flood relief bonds. The regulations and guarantees will be drafted and designated by the Finance Department and submitted to the Provincial Council for record. It is reported that Wu has departed to return to Hankou. Furthermore, the Finance Department borrowed 600,000 yuan from the foreign banks and immediately signed a contract to be used exclusively for government expenses. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Government Allocates Grain and Funds for Urgent Relief of Hubei Flood</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Zhou Xingtang and Wang Yiling telegraphed the Emergency Relief Association stating that the National Government has decided to allocate 400,000 yuan, 22,000 dan of Japanese rice, and 60,000 bags of wheat flour to Hubei for relief, which will be transported to Hankou immediately. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Li Jin flew to Shanghai on the 11th. Zhou Cangbai is temporarily in charge of the disaster relief branch. Fang Benren is also scheduled to return to Hankou on the 13th. Zhu Huaibing is expected to arrive in Jun County on the 12th. Wang Yiling and Zhou Xingtang remain in Shanghai, while Huang Wenzhi remains in Jiangxi to coordinate. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The disaster relief branch telegraphed the General Association on the 11th, requesting an allocation of 400,000 yuan to purchase rice in Jiangxi and Anhui for relief. The three disaster relief teams were established on the 11th, and He Shaoqing and Sun Junwu were re-elected as the leaders and deputy leaders. They are scheduled to depart for Huanggang on the 12th. The fourth and fifth teams will be established immediately and will go to Yunmeng and Qingshan to work. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<h3>Problem of Underwriting Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Three Million Can Be Raised Within a Month</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the underwriting of the disaster relief bonds, Finance Minister Song has repeatedly contacted the banking sector in Shanghai. The general plan is to base it on the banking sector raising funds, supplemented by fundraising from various agencies and organizations, and then begin issuing the bonds. Before the bond certificates are printed, pre-subscription vouchers will be issued first, and then the vouchers will be exchanged for the bonds. The building fees submitted by various agencies to the Central Party Headquarters will all be used to purchase these bonds. It is estimated that three million yuan can be raised within a month. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>High Tide in Shazhou</h3>
<p>(Jiangyin) In various districts of Shazhou, the tide rose sharply on the 11th. The Mengjiangtang area is completely flooded. The relief center telegraphed the Jiangsu Charity Relief Association, requesting an allocation of 50,000 yuan for urgent relief. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Municipal Works Bureau Seeks to Prevent Flooding</h3>
<p>Four Disaster Relief Shelters Have Been Established</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As the river water continues to rise for several consecutive days, the water level inside and outside the city walls of Xishuiguan differs by sixteen inches. The Municipal Works Bureau has taken measures to prevent flooding. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital City Flood Relief Association has established two disaster relief shelters each at Hanximen and Shuiximen, which can accommodate more than 15,000 disaster victims. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital City Flood Relief Association is scheduled to hold a discussion meeting on the 12th to discuss flood relief measures. Furthermore, the association stipulates that future relief to disaster victims will be provided in the form of food and not cash. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government Flood Relief Association is transporting a large batch of flour from Shanghai to Nanjing to provide relief to disaster victims. Xu Shiying arrived in Nanjing on the 11th to investigate relief efforts. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Department of Health has established a vehicle and ship epidemic prevention and inspection station in Xiaguan and appointed Cai Hong as the director, who has already begun organizing it. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Jiangbei Emergency Relief Association Offers Suggestions for Relief Distribution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Jiangbei Fellow Villagers Flood Emergency Relief Association in Beijing offered suggestions to the Jiangsu Provisional Charity Relief Association: (1) The current relief distribution is mostly focused on cities, neglecting rural areas. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this point in the future. (2) In addition to the two relief routes from Yangzhou to Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying, or from Shaobo to Xinghua and Yancheng, a route should also be established from the port to Taizhou to Dongtai, and from Yancheng and Funing to extend the relief. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The River Water in Jiangxi Rises Again</h3>
<p>Zhou Bopeng Surveys Pastures and Farmland</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) According to the experience of old farmers, if the water rises during the White Dew season, it will be difficult to recede until the Heavy Snow season, and winter crops are hopeless. The entire county needs at least two million in relief. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) Half of the draft cattle temporary pledge location, due to unsuitable cattle farms, insufficient cattle sheds, and prevalent cattle diseases, are dying in large numbers. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) Zhou Bopeng, a member of the National Government Disaster Relief Association, and Jin Shizhong, an engineer from the Dredging Bureau, went to Lotus Cave on the 10th to survey pastures and organize agricultural relief. There was no suitable farmland. They selected four pastures. They also discovered a coal mine at Pengjia River. Coal was found just a foot below the surface, covering approximately 4,000 mu, owned by the Peng family. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) The Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association remitted 20,000 yuan to Zhou Bopeng, intending to first allocate it to the shelters for supplies and then gradually provide emergency relief to the countryside. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) Heavy rain from the evening of the 10th continues to this day. Mountain floods have occurred, and the river water has risen. It is difficult to remove manure, and the drinking water is turbid. All the reed mats and blankets have been bought up. The shelters plan to use grass to cover the roofs, but it has been prevented by the rain. The disaster victims are submerged in water. More than a hundred people have died today. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Nakamura Incident Is Under Investigation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Not Express Its Opinion for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Nakamura Incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received two telegrams from the Northeast. The most recent telegram stated that it is still under investigation. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tentatively plans not to express its opinion until it receives confirmed information. Yesterday's report stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs planned to announce the truth of the matter to the international community, which is still a proposal.

<p>(Nanjing) An important figure in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a reporter that the Ministry had previously telegraphed the Northeast authorities to inquire about the truth of the Nakamura Incident. According to the reply, there were no clues. Recently, the Japanese have been excessively publicizing this matter. Their deliberate intentions are nothing more than to delay the progress of the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents. Moreover, the Ministry has not received any written communication from the Japanese side. They will remain calm and ignore this outrageous behavior. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Western Mongolian People Flee to the Ejina Banner to Make a Living</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, more than a thousand households of people from western Outer Mongolia have fled to the Ejina Banner in western Inner Mongolia due to unbearable oppression from Soviet Russia. The commission specially telegraphed the banner chief to properly settle them. If the people entering the country are still driven back to Outer Mongolia, they will definitely have no way to make a living. If they are allowed to stay there, there may be concerns about security. Furthermore, at a time when Soviet Russia is actively communizing Outer Mongolia, the returning people should be treated preferentially and settled down in order to win them over. Therefore, they have already telegraphed the banner chief to investigate and report in detail so that they can find a way to settle them down. (11th Dispatch)</p>

Regarding Feng's going abroad, various parties do not pay much attention to it, and it seems unnecessary to go abroad. Regarding the issue of Yan's amnesty, he had previously discussed it privately, but it has been stopped. Huang Luchu telegraphed earlier that Yan said that he would never do anything to harm the country and hoped that the people of the country would forgive him. Regarding the Guangdong issue, Shanxi generals will have expressions of helping the government. China previously needed revolution, but now it must not fight. The Shanxi currency problem has been drafted a reorganization plan, which must be carried out after I return to Shanxi. The return to Shanxi must be after the Yan leaving the country matter is resolved. I do not know what the authorities think of Yan. Pang Bingxun's troops have already been deployed, and Song Zheyuan's troops are moving. After the guest troops from Shanxi Province are deployed, there are still 100,000 troops in this province. I can represent the Shanxi generals for the public security in North China, and unanimously support the deputy commander. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The So-Called Nakamura Incident (II)</h3>
<p>Having already elaborated on the rebuttals regarding the Nakamura Incident in yesterday's commentary, we now delve further into the background of the so-called Nakamura Incident.</p>
<p>The true background of the Nakamura Incident, in a word, is the traditional Japanese continental policy. Since Hamaguchi resigned, if Wakatsuki becomes the successor prime minister, the opposition party in opposition will further use (diplomacy towards China) and (shaking of rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia) as excuses to attack him. Other military and politicians then echoed them. As a result, (tough diplomacy towards China) has become a consistent proposition. If we try to review the recent speeches of the Japanese government and the public, such as the words of Army Minister Minami, who warned the soldiers that "... at this time, those who are in the military should further strengthen their sincerity in serving the public, and devote their enthusiasm to education and training, and strive to complete their duties without any deficiencies," these few words actually contain extremely important meaning. For example, Mori Kaku of the Seiyukai and others reported on their return to the country after inspecting Korea and Manchuria, saying that "the antagonism between the Chinese and Japanese officials and people is extremely serious," and even declared that "China is on the verge of war with Japan." It is most evident that they deliberately create alarming words to provoke their country's people's antipathy towards China. As in the recent article (Unsettled Sino-Japanese Relations) by Hanzawa Gyokujo, the main writer of the Diplomatic Times, said, "(the actions of Chinese and Japanese officials and people are a declaration of war," and vigorously advocated the second Sino-Japanese War, saying that "the purpose of this war is to punish China's new warlords and new political children." His remarks are so arrogant that he simply does not know what international etiquette is. And his proposition of using force against China is even more openly put forward without any scruples. Due to the agitation of the environment and the encirclement of the surrounding air, Prime Minister Wakatsuki's speech at the Democratic Party's Northeast Hokkaido Congress on July 19 also contained the violent words of "(If China's measures are illegal and improper, then in order to correct them, we will of course exhaust diplomatic means and strive to the end. It is needless to say that for the sake of defending the survival of the country, we must not care about any sacrifice and resolutely rise up)." The so-called (illegal and improper) is no different from not allowing China to defend and consolidate itself. And the last two words are even more self-evident. Taking the above into consideration, the recent shift in Japan's policy towards China towards toughness and the rise of military and politicians' advocacy of force is an undeniable fact. And the successive occurrence of the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents was even more powerful evidence of its deliberate provocation. Until the sudden occurrence of the so-called Nakamura Incident this time, the Japanese have become even more eloquent. The proposition of armed invasion of China is even more blatant. For example, the Japanese cabinet meeting on the 8th decided that "... in the event that the Chinese side deliberately delays or conceals the truth of this case, Japan intends to immediately take measures that it recognizes as just based on material and factual evidence." As Army Minister Minami said to the news reporters after the cabinet meeting, "... I have made a resolute determination, but for the time being, we must see what the Chinese side's attitude is." As the Japanese Consulate in Shenyang announced, "The Northeast side lacks sincerity and will resort to strength to resolve the issue. Depending on the results of the second investigation team, if there is still no satisfactory expression, a head-on conflict between China and Japan will be unavoidable." What is particularly noteworthy is that the period of the conflict has also been predetermined by the Japanese consulate to be the 25th of this month. As ordinary politicians said, "If Japan does not take a tough stance on the Nakamura murder case and other Sino-Japanese disputes, China will still pursue the so-called delaying policy. There are a total of 300 Sino-Japanese disputes awaiting resolution. We must change our plan and follow the example of the Soviet Union and formally declare war on China in order to resolve all Sino-Japanese disputes." On the 8th, there were airplanes in Kanazawa, Japan, which, on the order of the local division headquarters, distributed leaflets to stir up the feelings of their people. The headquarters of the Kwantung Army also sent Colonel Doihara, the head of the special agency, to Tokyo on the 8th to contact the General Staff Headquarters to actively prepare for war. The Democratic Party held a cadre meeting on the 8th and vigorously advocated tough diplomacy towards China, and nominated Hyō Sun'ichi to organize a special committee on diplomacy towards China. Combining the above-mentioned Japanese statements and actions on the Nakamura Incident, it is completely clear that the Japanese people's deliberate exaggeration and incitement beyond the facts is completely based on their active aggression against our Northeast. The successive arrival of the Wanbaoshan Incident, the Korean Incident, and even the Nakamura Incident is for the sole purpose of provocation, inciting our people to be unbearable, and giving them the resources to justify their actions. Because our country has just suffered a flood, and the whole country is busy with disaster relief and has no time to look outward, Japan is taking advantage of our difficulties, taking advantage of the difficulties and adding to the difficulties, and trying to implement its continental policy step by step. Everyone knows Sima Zhao's intentions. Otherwise, even if the Nakamura Incident is true, why can't the Japanese side elaborate on the facts and solve it through diplomatic means, but deliberately make alarmist remarks and propose claims beyond the scope of the case as if some major event will happen immediately? It is already clear that it is taking advantage of our danger and taking advantage of the fire to rob. And the true background of the so-called Nakamura Incident is also fully revealed here, and the concealment is fully seen.</p>
<p>The Japanese are sharpening their blades, and their ambitions have been revealed. The days ahead are extremely worrying. Our people have suffered floods, and we are forced by strong neighbors. The country's steps are extremely difficult. The people of the country should be awakened and seek self-preservation together. If we continue to hide our diseases and avoid medical treatment, and only engage in concealment, and passively accept abuse, I am afraid that it will not be the way to respond to changes in the end. Furthermore, the fact that three or two Japanese people, such as Nakamura, are missing has not yet been ascertained, and the whole country is boiling, and protests are coming one after another. However, the Korean case, in which countless of our overseas Chinese were brutally killed, has been shelved until now without any clues. The negotiations on the massacre and the blood of the overseas Chinese have simultaneously solidified, and in contrast, it is really sad to feel that the weak country has no diplomacy, and the grief and pain are endless.</p>

<h3>The 19th Route Army Destroys the Main Force of the Jiangxi Bandits</h3>
<p>The First Decisive Battle After the Encirclement</p>
<p>Two Days and Nights of Bloody Battles in the Gaoxingxu Area</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang Telegram, (1) The 19th Route Army has been engaged in bloody battles for two days and nights in the Gaoxingxu, Yitianxu, and Changjingkou areas northwest of Xingguo with more than 20,000 bandits under Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang. The bandits were extremely ferocious, and our army fought heroically. The battle was one of the most intense in previous campaigns. More than 7,000 bandit corpses were buried on the battlefield. The main force of the bandits has been completely defeated by our forces and are now advancing victoriously towards Huichang. The vanguard is only ten miles away from the city. (2) Around Ji'an Donggu and near Qulai and Hengjiang, there are more than 1,000 Red Guard battalions of bandits hiding, colluding with local thugs and peasant bandits, plotting to take the opportunity to harass our rear. After encirclement and suppression by the Gong and Luo divisions, many bandits were killed, and the remnants fled towards Yongxin. (3) Mao Bingwen's troops, on the line between Xiaobu and Huangpi on the 10th, defeated the remnants of the bandits' pseudo 48th and 2nd Armies, and pursued them to Changqiao, killing many bandits. They are now searching and advancing in the area about 50 miles away from Xingguo. (11th)</p>
<p>Ji'an Chen Mingshu's circular telegram said, "To all newspaper offices, since the beginning of July, our suppression of the Red Army has been encircling and attacking the bandit areas. The bandits use the terrain and the Red citizens as protection, and habitually use their cunning evasion, clever attacks, and concealed tactics to tire our army and avoid decisive battles. Recently, the bandits took advantage of the fact that our armies were moving and fighting in different directions, coupled with continuous rainy weather, and airplanes could not conduct reconnaissance, and secretly moved all the bandit troops to ambush in the dangerous area northwest of Xingguo. On the Yuchen day of this month, our 19th Route Army and the 9th Division, in the area west of Xingguo, namely Gaoxingxu, Yitian, Changjingkou, Dundian, and Laoyingpan, encountered and fought with more than 50,000 bandits of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 12th under Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Lin, Luo, and Li for two days and nights, which was extremely fierce. From Yuye to Gengwei, the bandits even repeatedly charged our 60th Division in Gaoxingxu with their main concentrated forces, engaging in more than 20 bloody hand-to-hand combats. Army Commander Cai Tingkai personally led the troops in street fighting, and all the bandits were repelled. By Jiachen, all the bandits were completely defeated. It is estimated that in the Gaoxingxu area alone, the bandits left 7,000 to 8,000 corpses, and the number of wounded is unknown. Thousands of guns were seized, as well as the command flags of senior bandit commanders. It is estimated that this is the first decisive battle since our armies encircled the bandits, and the ferocity of the bandits and the alarming number of deaths are also rare in the campaign. After this great defeat, the bandits should not be able to recover. I hereby send this good news. Chen Mingshu Jiayi (11th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sino-Mexican Relations on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>The United States Does Not Want to Mediate</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, according to State Department personnel, the Sino-Mexican dispute will not be heard by the United States unless both countries jointly request the United States to intervene. The United States' attitude is obviously due to the fact that after the Chinese Embassy in Washington formally applied to the US State Department to mediate the Sino-Mexican dispute, a strong reaction occurred in Mexico City. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement criticizing the Chinese Embassy in Washington for interfering in the matter. Sino-Mexican relations are now on the verge of collapse (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Third Provincial Congress of Shanxi</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Miao Peicheng returned to Taiyuan on the evening of the 10th. According to him, he came specifically to guide the Third Provincial Congress of Shanxi and will return to Beijing after the meeting. The central government has long been determined to arrest Yan Xishan, so it has repeatedly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to strictly order the troops to arrest him. His meetings with Zhang Xueliang and Xu Yongchang in Beiping have indeed resulted in a solid plan. Recently, the general view is that arresting Yan is tantamount to expelling him, which is a mistake. Such a move is tantamount to declaring the central government's laws invalid. Regarding Shanxi's finances and all post-war matters, there is no hope of resolution before Yan Xishan leaves Shanxi. If Yan Xishan does not realize this, the central government will have to resort to final measures. Due to waiting for Miao Peicheng, the Third Provincial Congress of Shanxi was postponed until the morning of the 11th. Han Kewen presided over the meeting, and Miao Peicheng and Hong Ludong, the central government's election supervisor, delivered speeches. More than 80 representatives attended, and many people observed the ceremony. The first meeting was held in the afternoon. (11th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain Implements Austerity and Tax Increases</h3>
<p>Emergency Budget Submitted to the House of Commons</p>
<p>The National Atmosphere Suddenly Becomes Tense</p>
<p>The Government Adopts Extraordinary Measures to Deal with the Special Environment</p>
<p>The Deficit Can Still Be Offset with a Surplus of £1.5 Million</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th: The government's austerity plan was announced tonight. According to the plan, the government can immediately implement various austerity measures that have been proposed. The plan authorizes the British monarch to issue privy council orders deemed necessary within one month of the plan's implementation to implement austerity measures in public undertakings. The administrative events specifically mentioned in the plan, which are applicable to the privy council order, are education, national health, insurance, police, unemployment insurance, and roads. The privy council's orders do not require parliamentary approval and become law once promulgated. This procedure is rarely used in Britain and is only adopted in special circumstances. In the current situation, this procedure can be considered necessary for the sake of expediency. If a motion is submitted according to ordinary government procedures, it will inevitably be delayed and leave room for obstruction.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 11th: It is not yet certain whether there will be a reaction to the active austerity and sacrifice program announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden yesterday when he submitted the emergency budget to the House of Commons. However, the tense atmosphere that existed in the House of Commons before the budget was submitted seemed to have eased last night. In the evening, various newspapers issued special editions outside the Parliament to disseminate the Ministry of Finance's plan to the public. Almost everyone in the country is now talking about the budget measures. The increase in the standard rate of income tax and the reduction of various exemptions will greatly affect a large portion of the population. Those who previously had little income and were exempt from tax will now have an obligation to pay taxes. Among those who currently pay income tax, those in the middle class who rely on salaries and professions for a living will be most affected. However, the people now seem to be completely determined to make major sacrifices, and resignation has become the current buzzword.</p>
<h3>Scene in the Parliament</h3>
<p>The House of Commons was extremely crowded in the afternoon, which was rare in the past. When Snowden arrived at the House of Commons, the crowd cheered thunderously. When he entered the arena, the government faction also cheered to welcome him. Snowden rose to speak, first declaring that he would carry out the most unpleasant work he had never done in his life, and then began his program to make up for the national deficit. Mr. Snowden's budget speech this time was truly the most astonishing budget speech ever made in Britain.</p>
<p>Summary of Figures</p>
<p>The figures involved in the new budget plan can be summarized as follows: Snowden not only spoke about the position of income within the remaining number in this fiscal year, but also about the position in the next fiscal year. It is estimated that the budget for this year is short of £74,000,000, the reason being the world's industrial depression and reduced tax revenue. Domestic tax revenue is £65,000,000 less than the budget, customs and domestic tax revenue is £4,000,000 less, and the revenue from the UK's war debts under President Hoover's suspension plan is also reduced by £30,000,000. Snowden proposes to make up for the above shortages by: austerity £22,000,000, less provision for debt repayment £13,700,000, tax increases £40,000,000, totaling £76,200,000. In this way, the shortage of £74 million can be turned into a surplus of £1.5 million. As for the next fiscal year, according to the current expenditure and income, there will be a shortage of £170,000,000. To make up for this, the measures are as follows: austerity £70,000,000, less provision for debt repayment £20,000,000, tax increases £81,500,000, totaling £171,500,000.</p>
<p>Details of Austerity</p>
<p>The government has issued a white paper containing details of the austerity measures in the budget, with the aim of saving a total of £70,000,000 in national expenditure throughout the year. The most politically contentious of these measures is the change in the basis of unemployment insurance benefits, which alone can save £25,800,000 per year. The savings in education expenditure, including a 15% reduction in teachers' salaries, can amount to £10,300,000. Unemployment benefits will be reduced by 10%, and unemployment benefits will be limited to six weeks, after which they must be tested, otherwise they will not be able to receive benefits again. After this, the measure of borrowing to pay for unemployment benefits will be stopped. Other austerity measures, such as salary cuts for cabinet members, parliamentarians, soldiers, civilians, and officials, will amount to £4,500,000. Cabinet members with salaries of £5,000 per year will have their salaries reduced by 20%, and parliamentarians with annual salaries of £400 will have their salaries reduced by 10%. Judges' salaries will also be reduced accordingly. The pay of soldiers in the national defense forces will be paid according to the pay scale of those who enlisted after 1925. Officers' salaries will also be reduced to a level commensurate with the cost of living. In addition, military spending is planned to be reduced further, for a total saving of £5,000,000. Police expenditure can also be saved by £500,000. Road expenditure will be saved by approximately £7,800,000. Colonial development expenditure will be limited to £750,000 next year, saving £250,000. The British Empire Marketing Board's expenditure will also be cut by £250,000.</p>
<p>Collection of New Taxes</p>
<p>It is estimated that tax revenue will need to be increased by £81,500,000 in the next fiscal year. The measures are as follows: the standard rate of income tax is currently 4 shillings and 6 pence per pound, and will be 5 shillings in the future. However, businesses will be compensated separately, that is, the existing exemption for depreciation of fixed assets will be increased to offset the increase in income tax. In addition, income tax exemptions and special reductions will be strictly eliminated. Unmarried persons with an annual income of less than £135 were previously exempt from tax, but this is no longer the case. Only those with an annual income of less than £100 will be exempt from tax. The tax exemption limit for married persons was previously an annual income of £225, but it has now been reduced to £150. The annual allowance for children, previously £60 for the first child, is now £50, and the allowance for the remaining children has been reduced from £50 to £40. Income tax is more favorable for labor-earned income. Previously, one-sixth of labor-earned wages were exempt from income tax, up to a limit of £250. This has now been changed to one-fifth exempt from tax, up to a limit of £300. The surtax will be increased by 10%. In terms of indirect taxes, the tax on beer will be increased by one penny per pint, the tax on imported tobacco was previously 8 shillings and 10 pence per pound, but will now be 9 shillings and 6 pence. Other tobacco will be taxed accordingly. The tax on oil will be increased by two pennies per gallon, and entertainment tax will be levied according to the new regulations, even on cheap seats. The maximum tax will be two pennies, but children's tickets will not be taxed.</p>
<p>Newspaper Criticism</p>
<p>Snowden's budget will naturally be criticized by the Labor Party. The measures he has proposed will inevitably face extremely fierce opposition in the legislative process. This morning, the Labor Party's mouthpiece, the Daily Herald, launched a major attack, saying that the sacrifices of the rich and the poor are not equal, and that Snowden has changed the course of his life's work and is going against the tide under pressure from the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, and the bankers. The Conservative and Liberal Party newspapers said that they are capable of distributing and averaging the burden. The rich and the poor will show the world an honorable solution with one heart. Even if there is harm, they can only accept it. Otherwise, the panic would not be limited to this. The measures are indeed harsh, but in the circumstances of the previous month, Snowden had no other choice. Such were the detailed discussions in the newspapers. Last night, after the budget was submitted, a member of the House of Commons said to a Reuters reporter, "Let's have a drink while the price is up." The spirit of the people accepting this severe plan can be seen from these words. The Conservative Party is also alarmed by the heavy burden of income tax. Take the example of a family with two children whose annual salary is £500. They previously paid £8 in income tax, but will now have to pay £60.</p>
<h3>Plan to Exchange Bonds</h3>
<p>The Finance Bill contains a proposal to allow the government to exchange 5% war bonds for lower-interest bonds. Snowden mentioned this in his budget speech, saying that since 1929, the situation has been unstable, so this plan has not been implemented. He intends to ask Parliament to authorize the government to formulate a plan to ask those who hold 5% war bonds to exchange them for new bonds. If the bondholders do not object within three months of the issuance of the exchange notice, it will be deemed that they have agreed. In order to implement this plan, the government is requested to grant this power so that the Ministry of Finance can formulate measures to change the interest rate and extend the repayment period. This kind of exchange is unprecedented in world history and will require a considerable period of time to carry out. It will take several months to complete.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>Waiting for its price to rise. The spirit of the people accepting this severe plan can be seen from this saying. The Conservative Party is also alarmed because the burden of income tax is very heavy. To try with a family with two children, the person who earns an annual salary of 500 pounds, from now on will have to pay 60 pounds.</p>
<h3>Plan for Bond Exchange</h3>
<p>The Financial Law contains a proposal to allow the government to exchange five-li war bonds for lower interest rate bonds. Snowden mentioned this in his budget speech and said that the situation had been uncertain since 1929, so this plan had not been implemented. The official plans to ask Congress to authorize the government to formulate a plan, requesting those holding five-li war bonds to exchange them for new coupons. If the holders of the coupon have no objection within three months of the issuance of the exchange notice, it shall be deemed that they have agreed to implement this plan, and requesting Congress to authorize this power, the Ministry of Finance may formulate methods to change the interest rate and extend the repayment period. This type of exchange is unprecedented in world history and needs a considerable period of time to carry out. It takes months to complete.</p>
<h3>Opposition's Attack</h3>
<p>After Snowden spoke for an hour and seventeen minutes and sat down, his supporters cheered for a long time. Former Secretary of Commerce Graham stood up and said that if the provision for debt repayment reserve funds were completely omitted, it could temporarily cope with the current financial situation. The government's proposed measures are inconsistent with the principle of equal sacrifice. People in the labor sector without any guarantees would be the only ones to suffer. The Labor Party cannot agree to this. The Labor Party then proposed a motion to reject the national austerity plan, signed by four former cabinet members including Klein, stating that the House recognizes the need to maintain national finances on a sound basis but cannot accept a plan that deprives the majority of the people of their basic necessities while allowing others to live in luxury. This plan would limit the purchasing power of workers, further increasing unemployment. The national austerity plan seeks to replace existing laws with orders from the Privy Council or to change national policies abruptly without the consent of the House. The Labor Party cannot agree to this. This afternoon, the Prime Minister will propose the second reading of the austerity plan.</p>
<h3>Inskeep's Proposal</h3>
<p>During the House debate on Snowden's budget speech, Liberal Party member Inskeep made a noteworthy proposal, stating that during the war, the import of luxury goods was banned because the nation's financial resources should be concentrated on important uses. Now, a three-person committee should be organized to study whether it is possible to completely prohibit the import of luxury goods. Inskeep served as Minister of Education and Minister of Commerce in the wartime coalition cabinet and was a leading figure in the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Arrives in Marseilles</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome from the Crowd</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Marseilles, 11th - Today, hundreds of people gathered at the pier to await the arrival of the British shipping company's Rajputana, which was carrying Gandhi to London. As the ship docked, Gandhi stood on the deck, wearing only homespun coarse cloth around his waist and a homespun large shawl over his shoulders, despite the damp weather. The crowd cheered thunderously upon seeing him, and Indian students on the shore cheered incessantly, their throats becoming hoarse. Gandhi responded with a hand-to-forehead gesture of respect. When the gangway was lowered, newspaper reporters and photographers rushed forward, and the police could not stop them. Gandhi was trapped in the center of the crowd and asked for forgiveness to retreat temporarily to get some fresh air. It was then decided that reporters who wanted to see him must gather in groups of five or more and could not enter individually. Gandhi is expected to arrive in Folkestone at 1:00 PM tomorrow and then travel to London by car.</p>
<h3>Japan Adds Combat Weaponry</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 11th - The Army Aviation Headquarters ordered Mitsubishi Aircraft Company to manufacture a super bomber four years ago, which is expected to be completed this month. The production cost of this new aircraft is 500,000 yuan and is a purely Japanese product. It is equipped with four engines, each with 750 horsepower, and has a cruising speed of 170 kilometers per hour, making it the world's largest fighter.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Manila telegram to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government Chairman Chiang, Beiping Deputy Commander Zhang, Guangzhou Wang Jingwei, Gu Yingfen, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Tang Shaoyi, Sun Zhesheng, all military and political leaders across the country, all organizations, all newspapers, and all compatriots: Our country has been plagued by years of civil war and communist disturbances. The national situation is critical. This year, a sudden flood has brought the people to the brink of disaster. Neighboring powers are encroaching on us, with increasingly egregious actions. Anti-Chinese incidents in Korea and Mexico have arisen one after another. The nation is in mortal danger. The whole country should prioritize the overall situation, put aside personal grievances, and work together to salvage the situation. If we continue to pursue selfish interests and reignite civil war, the suppression of the communists will fail, the Japanese will seize the opportunity to invade, and the tens of millions of disaster victims will either die in the floods or in the crossfire. Those who do not die by drowning will die of starvation due to obstructed military transportation and a lack of relief. This would hasten the country's demise and put all the people in dire straits. If selfish ambitions are not curbed, the nation will perish. Without the skin, where will the fur attach? Only the insane and deranged would dare to do this. National Government Chairman Chiang recently issued a telegram confessing his mistakes, painfully describing the perilous state of the nation, opposing the re-ignition of civil war, and requesting that the whole country unite to provide disaster relief, suppress the communists, and overcome difficulties together. This is truly the essential plan for the nation today and the only way out for the nation. The 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines are far away in the southern sky, but who does not have a homeland? Fearing that our country will be shattered and our people will perish, we dare to telegram our opposition to civil war, asking all compatriots at home and abroad to support the central government's policy of peaceful unification, disaster relief, and communist suppression. We implore national leaders to consider the difficulties of the times, meet with sincerity, jointly maintain the overall situation, avert the imminent collapse, and continue the precarious national destiny. If there are still those with malicious intentions who destroy peace and lightly initiate war, seeking to assert themselves, they will be ostracized by the people and despised by the world. We are willing to abandon them together with our compatriots. Humbly presenting this urgent telegram, the Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Educational Association, Benevolent Society, and various trade associations bow their heads.</p>
<p>Tianjin telegram to all newspapers: We have read the telegrams from the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander, and their concern for the people and sincerity in planning for the country inspire all. This natural disaster is truly caused by human actions. Floods were reported after water management was neglected, and famine was reported after granaries were empty. Who causes such calamities if not those who disregard these preparations? Now, internal communist unrest and external Japanese aggression make the people seem like overturned nests and the country like fragile eggs. Even the salt-producing regions have suffered unprecedented disasters. The sea has reversed its flow, and the river rages. The black-haired people are reduced to white bones, and green fields are turned into yellow sand. How can we not grieve for our people? We should all feel sorrow and share the same heart. Soldiers invade and seek each other out, repeating the same mistakes. If we ignore the lessons of the past and create new disputes, we will undermine the nation's foundation and sever the ties of humanity, creating endless disasters and irredeemable misfortunes. If the nation perishes, what is the point of holding titles and lands? We hope that all the wise and talented people of the country will unite and work together to change our destiny, overcome difficulties, save the people, appease the difficult to appease, and prepare for future disasters. We should expand the Commander-in-Chief's instructions to fulfill our responsibilities and make up for our mistakes, and take the Deputy Commander's words of eliminating boundaries as our duty. We should divert military supplies to provide relief grain or provide a cup of water as an act of kindness. We should adopt a united front to get through these trying times. We should use the flood as an opportunity to cease hostilities, then the restoration can be expected. The way to prosperity is not far off. Xue Ming, holding a position in Tianjin, dare not overstep his bounds and offer unwarranted opinions. However, deeply concerned about the disaster, he humbly presents these words. Zhang Xueming, Mayor of Tianjin, bows his head.</p>
<p>Hankou telegram to all newspapers: Here is the reply to the telegram from Chairman Chiang of the National Government: Urgent telegram to Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: We have read your telegram and deeply appreciate your concern for the country, love for the people, strict self-criticism, and tolerance of others. Anyone with a conscience will be grateful. The brutality of the communist bandits and the devastation of the floods are unprecedented. Either one of these is unbearable for the country. The combination of both is a disaster. Adding to this the encroachment of neighboring powers and the bullying of foreign powers, this is a critical moment for the nation and a near-death experience for the nation. Even if the whole country unites to save the country from its difficulties, it may still not be enough. How can we bear to see brothers fighting each other? Recently, we heard that the rebels in Guangdong have taken advantage of this crisis to disturb the border of Hunan. What is their intention? The people are calling for the suppression of the communists, but they are providing support. The people are calling for disaster relief, but they are creating obstacles. The people are calling for resisting foreign aggression, but they are assisting the enemy from within. It is as if the people are already thrown into a well, and they are throwing stones on top of them. The people are already walking through fire, and they are adding fuel to the flames. They are truly snakes at heart and wolves in nature. Your Excellency follows good advice and eliminates evil. Those who repent can be forgiven for their past deeds and treated equally. Those who persist in their errors will not be tolerated. Now, Guangdong and Guangxi are recklessly destroying peace, turning against the people, and becoming enemies of the country. We pledge to follow our comrades, stand ready for battle, express our unwavering loyalty, and unleash our common hatred of the enemy to eliminate the culprits and save the people. We humbly present our sincere feelings. We implore you to consider. He Chengjun, Li Mingzhong, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Qian Dajun, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, Fan Shisheng, Xiao Zhichu, Zhang Zhenhan, Guo Rudong, Dai Minquan, Xie Bin, Zhang Ying, Yuan Ying, Zhao Guanying, Zhu Huaishui, Liu Peixu, Xu Dezhao, Luo Qiqiang, Pan Shanqi, Li Dingwu, Li Zongjian, etc., bow their heads.</p>
<p>Qiqihar telegram to all newspapers: The floods in the southern and central provinces have caused severe disasters, and frequent reports of the disaster have deeply distressed us. We believe that helping those who are drowning or starving is a long-standing principle. Collective efforts are imperative. Therefore, on the 7th of this month, a joint meeting of party, military, government, academic, gentry, and business circles was held and resolved to establish a Disaster Relief Association for the flood-stricken provinces, which was established on the same day. The Vice Commander of the Border Defense and Chairman of the Provincial Government, Wan Fulun, was elected as the President. The remaining members were divided into groups to handle affairs and initially raised 50,000 yuan to purchase grain and transport it to the disaster areas to help the disaster victims and relieve the extraordinary disaster. We humbly submit this telegram for your consideration. The Disaster Relief Association of Heilongjiang Province bows.</p>

<h3>Continued Discussion on the Wanbaoshan Incident Still Yields No Results</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Suddenly Raises the Twenty-One Demands</p>
<p>Insists on Not Allowing Koreans to Leave the Territory</p>
<p>Zhong Yu Severely Refutes but Remains Adamant</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch: Zhong Yu, special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, returned to Harbin on August 14 to handle the affairs of the Harbin Municipal Preparatory Office (Zhong also serves as the director) and the negotiation office. He then went to Jilin on August 24 to continue negotiations with the Japanese Consul in Jilin, Ishisa, regarding the Wanbaoshan incident. Because the Japanese Consul refused to allow the Koreans living in the Wanbaoshan area to withdraw from the territory, he went to Liaoning on August 28 to see Zhang Zuoxiang, who was stationed in Shenyang, to seek instructions. He returned to Jilin on August 31 and continued negotiations. However, Ishisa firmly insisted that the Koreans residing in the Zhang Hongbin village in Wanbaoshan have the right to reside in the interior of the eastern provinces, according to Article 21 of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of May 7, 1915, and that this is a vested interest. The text of the treaty clearly states that the Chinese side should not use the Wanbaoshan case as a precondition to demand their withdrawal. Regarding the contract of the Changnong Rice Field Company, the Koreans have the freedom to reside in the local area. It is too late for rice paddies this year, but next year they must continue the original contract and carry out planting. The contract has been approved by the Changchun local government and is valid. During the current period, the Chinese local authorities must do their best to protect the Koreans to prevent them from encountering accidents. Zhong Yu refuted that this case is a local judicial procedure issue, and the validity of the contract should be determined by whether or not it has been formally approved by the government. The intrusion of Koreans into the Chinese interior in Wanbaoshan and the disruption of local order are the preconditions for this case. Therefore, they must first withdraw before the validity of the contract can be discussed. Article 21 was signed by the head of state who did not formally represent China, and the Chinese people have long denied it. It cannot be cited as a basis. Ishisa still refused. After two negotiations, no progress was made. Zhong Yu then went to Liaoning again on September 4 to report to Zhang Zuoxiang. Therefore, local negotiations on this case are temporarily difficult to start. The number of Korean households in the Zhang Hongbin village in Wanbaoshan is still 25, with a population of 60. Although the local farmers refuse to trade with them, the Japanese Consulate in Changchun transports batches of vegetables and food to them to provide relief, and from time to time sends plainclothes police officers to comfort them and investigate the actions of our farmers. Therefore, the Koreans have a talisman and intend to reside there permanently. The ditch near Majiashaokou is still as it was, indicating that this problem is not easy to solve. (6th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Canal Project Aftermath Committee</h3>

<h3>Water Disaster Association of Five Counties Asks for Speedy Opening of Company's Water-Blocking Dams</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang, Yancheng, Fudong, and Xinghua Water Disaster Aftermath Association sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, saying: Chairman Ye Junjian, we recently received a telegram from the Dongtai County District Party Department and various legal groups, requesting the provincial government to send troops to assist in opening the Sanmao You River and water-blocking dams of the Dafeng Yuhua and other companies. We then received a telegram on the 30th, stating that Director Zhang and Director Li have been instructed to dispatch teams to assist and notify the Salt Reclamation Company not to obstruct, etc. It was not until late in the day that Senator Zhang, along with Provincial Committee members He Haiqiao and Xu Ji, led a team to Dongtai, which was discussing opening the company's water-blocking dams first and then opening the 800-zhang channel. Suddenly, we heard that Director He telegraphed the province, only mentioning opening the 800-zhang channel, without mentioning opening the company's dams. This contradicted both the provincial government's telegram order and the record of the temporary consultation. It was clearly deceived by the company's false statements. The water is rising, the people are panicking, and the deaths are increasing. The situation is extremely critical. We respectfully plead with you to describe the situation to the provincial government and immediately telegram the various provincial departments to order that the company's water-blocking dams be opened first, followed by the 800-zhang channel to discharge water and save the millions of dying people who are crying for help. Do not be fooled by the company's backers and only open the 800-zhang channel, which the company has been trying to open for many years. This would be like allowing the bladder to function while blocking the throat and internal organs. The water is deep, the disaster is imminent, and the situation is critical. We await your orders with tears and also ask that you forward this to various newspapers for publication to enlist the righteous assistance of all sectors. The Sanmao You River is located within the embankments of the Dafeng and Yuhua companies. Since the dike collapsed, the western water has flowed down, submerging all the counties in the lower reaches. The people of various counties have repeatedly requested that the river and the water-blocking dikes be opened to discharge the water into the sea. At first, they were opened and blocked again, causing public outrage. Now that your government has negotiated with the pacification commissioner to dispatch a team to supervise the opening, we were happy to hear it. However, when your government's committee members executed the order, they deviated from the main issue and first excavated the 800-zhang channel between the Mao You River and Wanggang, intending to discharge the water from Wanggang and still trying to protect the company's dikes. Hundreds of thousands of lives are in the water every day. If we wait for the 800-zhang channel to be opened, we may all perish. The lake water is surging endlessly, and the downstream outlet is so difficult to deal with. Even if the company does not understand righteousness and profit, the government should weigh the importance of the matter. We respectfully implore you to adhere to your original intention, disregard everything, and immediately telegram Director He to quickly open the company's water-blocking dikes, in addition to opening the Sanmao You River, and then open the 800-zhang channel to save the emergency and avoid delays. We await your orders with utmost urgency. The Zhenjiang, Yancheng, Fudong, and Xinghua Water Disaster Aftermath Association bows.</p>
<h3>Guo Bingquan's Investigation Report on the Disaster Situation in Xinghua and Vicinity</h3>
<p>The breach of the canal caused a great catastrophe. Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, attached great importance to this extraordinary disaster. In addition to providing emergency relief in the disaster area, he sent Song Bangrong, his adjutant, to investigate the disaster situation. Recently, he sent Guo Bingquan, an official of the commissioner's office, to Xinghua and vicinity for inspection, as a basis for implementing emergency relief and appealing to the outside world. The following is a transcript of Guo Bingquan's inspection report, to give a glimpse of the disaster situation:</p>
<p>(1) I, in my humble capacity, was ordered to go to Xinghua and Yancheng to investigate the flood disaster. I hired a boat on the second day of this month and went to Shaobo Town. The main hall of the Great King Temple in the town was washed away by the water, and the houses along the embankment were scattered. The breach was being blocked by soldiers of the 25th Route Army in cooperation with the people. I then went to the town's Chamber of Commerce and asked Sun Juru, the person in charge of disaster relief. He said that Shaobo was not far from Zhenyang, and rescue boats were constantly transporting food to the area, so the refugees could be rescued one after another. Even those who did not want to leave had access to relief food, which ensured their survival. I then asked him to help find a boat to Xinghua. However, Shaobo to Xinghua is about 130 miles, and the fields and rivers are indistinguishable, a vast expanse of water. The telegraph has been out of service for a long time. The boatmen either refused because they did not know the way, or replied that the boat was too small. After about three hours, I finally found a boat. Fortunately, the wind was favorable, and I was able to safely cross Shaobo Lake and reach Yangjia Village. The water was deep along the way, measuring about twelve feet. Almost half of the houses in each village had collapsed. A few residents were still nesting in trees, or taking small boats to the high banks of the embankment. I also saw floating coffins drifting by from time to time, the disaster reaching even the remains of the dead. About three miles from the village, a strong northwest wind blew up, and the turbid waves roared. The boat could not stop and drifted with the wind. When we reached a place with many trees, the wind subsided slightly, and we were able to drop anchor. The next morning, after about three hours of sailing, we finally found the original route and crossed Liu'an before we could raise the sail and sail to Fanchuan Town, which is the intersection of Taixian, Jiangdu, and Gaoyou counties. From a distance, the water in the town was about three feet deep. Most of the houses facing the waves had collapsed. There were already two small rescue boats there. We passed the town and followed the Gaotai boundary embankment. The embankment was breached by the water, forming a sawtooth shape. Very few of the telegraph poles along the embankment remained standing. After traveling about five miles along the embankment, the embankment was completely submerged in the water, with only a silver waterline visible. The floodwater flowed eastward, but was blocked by the base of the embankment, causing it to rise and form this silver waterline. At this time, the boat had sailed into the eastern boundary of Gaoyou. The water depth in the rice fields was measured to be about thirteen feet. Soon, we saw a floating corpse, its naked belly swollen like a drum, entangled in the woods. We could tell it was a woman. In the evening, we arrived at Lao Ge Village in Xinghua, passed Wao Village, Shili Pavilion, Balipu, and Wulian, and reached the outside of Xinghua city gate in about ten hours. The water depth in this section was about fourteen feet. Many villagers were living in small boats, guarding their former homes and not leaving. The wilderness outside the south gate of the county was boundless. From the east to Dongtai, from the west to Gaoyou, and from the south to Taixian, the white waves were surging, and there was no end in sight. There were very few villages, resembling an ocean. On the morning of the fourth day, I hired a small boat to enter the city. The water outside the city reached half of the gate, and the houses in the deeper areas were submerged. The water inside the city was also three or four feet deep. The entire city was flooded, except for the county government hall, which was not flooded. When the boat arrived at the county government, it was only eight o'clock. The county magistrate was ill and had not gotten up, and the section chief was also not there. I then went to find Leng Zeng. His family had moved three times from their original residence in Tao Sha Lane to Liu Jia Lane. He said that since the Yun embankment collapsed on August 25, causing the Xinghua disaster, he had taken photographs of the disaster situation and submitted them to Your Excellency. I then went with Leng Zeng to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Hua and inquire about the disaster situation. He replied that since the beginning of summer, there had been torrential rains, which had flooded the fields, accounting for half of the county. On August 3, the Gaoyou Cheluo was opened, and on the 5th, the You Nan Nanguan Dam was also opened. The water rushed down, and the county became a watery country. On the night of August 25, there was a heavy rain and a hurricane. From the six sluices in Shaobo to the Bao Ying Canal Dam, there were more than ten breaches. The county rose more than two feet in a day and night. The low-lying streets inside and outside the city were submerged, and the people in the four rural areas lived in boats. The poor people waited for rescue by clinging to trees, a truly miserable sight. I asked about the areas most severely affected by the disaster. He replied that the entire county was submerged, and it was impossible to distinguish between the severity of the disaster. However, the southeast was higher than the northwest, and fewer people drowned in the higher areas, which could be slightly differentiated. I asked how to provide relief to the refugees. He replied that the county had suffered from insect plagues, droughts, and floods for years, and its finances were extremely strained. The county's 300-plus police force had been in arrears for three months. Even the food in the county government could not be maintained, and there was no power to provide rescue. Fortunately, the provincial government had sent 5,000 yuan for disaster relief, and another 8,000 yuan would be sent soon. The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association would also come to distribute relief. The 5,000 yuan had already been used to purchase flour and distribute it to various districts. A refugee camp had also been set up in the county government, but it was just a drop in the bucket. He hoped that all sectors of society would do their best to help Xinghua, which was on the verge of disaster, so that the people of Xinghua could escape this catastrophe. I asked about the defense situation. He replied that there were occasional bandits stirring, but the county police force, water patrol team, and local defense corps were strictly guarding against them, so they were still able to maintain peace. The various disaster situations could be found in the county's flood disaster investigation report. I asked if he knew about the disaster situation in Yancheng. He replied that the county's telegraph was out of service, and he did not know. However, Yancheng was higher than this county, and it was heard that the early rice had already been harvested, which was thought to be better than this county. I also went with Leng Zeng to the county's Chamber of Commerce. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Gu Lunan, described the disaster situation, which was similar to what County Magistrate Hua had said. When asked about the method of receding the water, he replied that it was necessary to block the breaches in Yun Lake and open the Zi Wu Dam (ie, the Dafeng Dam). I said that the Yun Lake breach had been blocked by my superintendent, who had ordered the 25th Route Army to cooperate with the Water Conservancy Bureau and the people. I asked about the necessity of opening Zi Wu. He replied that the Zi Wu Dam was in Dongtai County, about 30 miles from the East China Sea. It was built by Zhang Jian when he developed Nantong. This embankment blocked the floodwater from going to the East China Sea. If this embankment was opened, the floodwater from several counties could be discharged into the East China Sea. However, the Kenmu Company had strong influence. It was heard that there were Japanese shareholders, and they used force to guard the dam and not allow it to be opened. In order to protect their own petty interests, they made the people of seven counties become food for fish and turtles. Please ask the superintendent to find a way to open it. At that time, Shi Zezhi, an inspector from the Department of Civil Affairs, came here from Taixian to observe. He said that the most severely affected area was Xinghua, followed by Gaoyou, Shaobo, Yancheng, Dongtai, and Taixian. When talking about the opening of the Zi Wu Dam, Shi said that he had heard that the Zi Wu Dam was opened on the first day of this month, but then he heard that the Zi Wu Dam was opened and then blocked again. The public deeply hoped that the Zi Wu Dam would be opened, so that there would be a way out. I had already learned that the disaster situation in Yancheng was lighter, and there were few transportation boats. So I entrusted Leng Zeng to submit the disaster situation in Xinghua and other counties to Your Excellency one after another. I then returned to report first. Therefore, I respectfully submit the disaster situation that I have investigated, along with the disaster situation report from the Xinghua County Magistrate, for your information. Investigator, Guo Bingquan.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Relief Funds in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently received a report from the Department of Civil Affairs on the distribution of relief funds. It immediately instructed the department to quickly order officials to claim and distribute the relief funds allocated to the various counties. At the same time, the amount of income and expenditure of the 150,000 yuan of provincial funds previously allocated should be published in the newspapers on a specific date to ensure that everyone knows about it, and a report should be submitted for reference. The following is a transcript of the original report from the Department of Civil Affairs: (According to the instructions No. 6067 of the President's Office, and the telegram from the Relief Committee, the number of deaths and losses from the Gao Shao breach is countless, and it is heartbreaking to talk about it. The government has allocated 130,000 yuan in relief funds to your province. Commissioner Wang Yiting went to Zhen to discuss emergency relief. He sent a telegram to Shanghai the other day, which should have been received. Commissioner Wang Yi Lao should have arrived in Zhen. Please show the tragic state of the disaster at any time, etc. In addition to replying by telegram and ordering the Department of Agriculture and Mining, this order is for the department to comply with and report the disaster situation in each county in detail for verification, and to submit the emergency relief plan discussed for reference. In accordance with this order, after checking this relief fund, the telegram from the Relief Committee was received by the department for the same reason. Commissioner Wang Yiting arrived in Zhen on the 30th, and a relief meeting was held on the same day. Everyone agreed that the disaster was severe and the area was vast. The 130,000 yuan allocated was not enough to distribute. It was decided to borrow from the provincial relief committee to borrow from the provincial relief committee. It was decided to borrow 1 million yuan from the construction public bonds, and sell 200,000 yuan first, and incorporate the 130,000 yuan into the distribution. The remaining 70,000 yuan was allocated to the committee for reserve. Commissioner Wang has gone to Shanghai to negotiate with the bank to handle it. As for the disaster situation in Gao Shao, it is reported that the water has gradually receded, and most of the disaster victims, except for those who have been taken in, have gathered in higher places, waiting for relief urgently. Many streets have not yet recovered, countless houses have been destroyed, and corpses are everywhere, making it difficult to bear to look at. The exact number of losses and deaths will be reported in detail to the department for further reporting. The reply by telegram is on file. In accordance with the previous order, in addition to waiting for the investigation of the disaster situation in each county to be completed, and reporting in detail in another document, the consultation situation and the distribution list will be prepared in advance for reporting, hoping for review and implementation.) Attached is the distribution list of relief funds for each county: Jiangpu 10,000 yuan, Gaoyou 25,000 yuan, Tongshan 10,000 yuan, Xinghua 20,000 yuan, Bao Ying 10,000 yuan, Huai'an 10,000 yuan, Huaiyin 10,000 yuan, Siyang 10,000 yuan, Luhe 10,000 yuan, Dongtai 10,000 yuan, Lianshui 5,000 yuan, Jiangdu 10,000 yuan, Yangzhou 5,000 yuan, Suqian 5,000 yuan, Wanchun 5,000 yuan, Yancheng 10,000 yuan, Funing 10,000 yuan, Taixian 10,000 yuan, Liyang 5,000 yuan, Shuyang 5,000 yuan, Jintan 5,000 yuan, Pixian 3,000 yuan, Xiaoxian 6,000 yuan, Yizheng 3,000 yuan, Rugao 5,000 yuan, Taixing 3,000 yuan, Fengxian 5,000 yuan, Dangshan 3,000 yuan, Suining 3,000 yuan, Yixing 5,000 yuan, Danyang 3,000 yuan, Jurong 2,000 yuan, Donghai 2,000 yuan, Lishui 2,000 yuan, Peixian 2,000 yuan, Ganyu 3,000 yuan, Jiangning 5,000 yuan, Zhenjiang 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shantou Quarantine Station Negotiates the Recovery of Sovereignty</h3>
<p>The British Consul Actually Refused to Accept a Chinese Doctor and Was Humiliated</p>
<p>The Taikoo Steamer Sailed Without Inspection</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: Xu Xiren, the director of the Shantou Quarantine Station, has recently been proceeding smoothly with the recovery of the harbor quarantine rights that have been lost for many years. However, the British Consul stationed in Shantou believes that British ships traveling to the Chinese coast and the British-owned islands in the South Seas account for the first place in Shantou Port. The British Consulate sent the British doctor, Lian Tingli, to take charge of the ship quarantine affairs and collect inspection fees. The income from this item is very large. Therefore, when the former director of the quarantine station, Huo Qizhang, was in office, the British Consul privately signed a secret agreement with Huo. The quarantine station did not ask about the quarantine rights at all. The British Consul only allocated several tens of thousands from the ship fees to the quarantine station for expenses. Recently, Xu Xiren decided to recover the quarantine rights and negotiated with the British Consul many times. There have been no less than ten documents. However, the British Consul refused to return them. The quarantine station then notified the shipping companies that, starting from September 1, the Shantou port quarantine affairs would be inspected and charged by the medical officers dispatched by the station. Anyone who dared to resist would be severely punished. Unexpectedly, the British Consulate also notified the shipping companies at the same time that they must still be inspected and paid by Dr. Lian Henry, otherwise the ships would still have to pay back when they arrived at the British ports. As a result, each went to extremes. On September 1, the Taikoo shipping line's Guangzhou ship sailed to Siam. The medical officer of the quarantine station went on board to check and collect fees. It happened to meet Dr. Lian Henry. The Chinese doctor was actually humiliated. On the 4th, the Taikoo ship Anhui was sailing to Singapore. The British shipowner refused the Chinese medical officer's inspection again. The quarantine station was angry and refused to issue a health certificate. At 5 p.m., the ship obtained the consent of the British Consul and sailed out of the port. The quarantine station believed that the British side deliberately despised our national sovereignty. On the 5th, it sent a telegram to the Guangzhou government to report. The telegram read: (The Shantou Taikoo shipping line first violated the rules and refused to pay the inspection fee, and then on the 4th, the company's Anhui ship sailed without being inspected by my office. Please immediately order the Chao Hai Customs Supervisor to transfer to the Customs Department that all export ships will not be allowed to leave the port without being inspected and issued a health certificate by my office to maintain the quarantine rights. I will submit the rest later.) At the same time, the quarantine station also sent a letter to the British Consul, protesting: (1) The British Consul must make a formal apology, (2) Guarantee that Dr. Lian Henry will not go on board again to overstep his authority to carry out quarantine inspections and that the same incident will not occur again. The results will be reported later. (September 6).</p>
<h3>The Qing Municipal Government's Proposal to Fill the Big Port Bay</h3>
<p>Use the Reef Mountain Range to Turn the Bay into Land</p>
<p>For the Construction of Warehouses, Docks, and Factories</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Since taking office, Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu has established a design committee to develop the city. Since the establishment of the committee, it has made many suggestions for municipal construction. Yuan Daochong, a member of the committee, proposed that there is a concave bay on the northeast side of the breakwater in the city's large port, covering an area of ​​approximately 20,000 acres. Now, due to the gradual rise of sand and the accumulation of tides, the entire area is exposed to the sea surface, forming a small island. It is proposed to fill this bay into land, which can be used for the construction of warehouses, factories, and docks. The committee has submitted the proposal to the city government's municipal meeting, which decided that the three bureaus of Public Works, Port Affairs, and Finance, as well as the Observatory, will form a committee to conduct measurements first, in order to study the method of filling. The original text of the design committee's proposal is recorded below: (It is submitted to suggest filling the concave bay on the northeast side of the breakwater in the big port and organizing a committee to conduct measurements first, hoping for review. According to the proposal of Yuan Daochong, a member of our committee, the northeast side of the breakwater in the city's big port has a coastline that curves into a concave-shaped bay. The southwest corner of this bay is adjacent to the third wharf, the south follows the railway line, encircling to the Sifang station, and the northeast reaches the back of the inner and outer cotton mills. The mountain rocks here enter the sea to form reefs, facing the large reefs on the side of the fifth wharf, forming the gateway to this bay. In recent years, the bay has been filled with sand, and the bottom is completely exposed at low tide, and the reefs on the side of the fifth wharf have been silted into a delta shape, protruding into the sea from the road embankment, with a diameter of about half a kilometer. The opposite bank is the white-filled land of the inner and outer cotton mills, protruding into the sea, accounting for about 2,000 acres. If we use the reef mountain range to build an outer embankment from behind the inner and outer cotton mills, and connect it to the original breakwater, and fill this concave bay into land, the area will be about 20,000 acres. This new land has four uses: (1) The entire area close to the bay can be used for warehouses and open storage areas, (2) The area close to Sifang can be used for large factories and the expansion of the market, (3) The starting point of the big port breakwater is adjacent to the newly filled land, which can be used for adding wharves, (4) Building an embankment from the Haibo River estuary to extend the river channel to reach the newly filled coast, using the tide, which can be used for sailboats to enter and exit. It is proposed that the municipal government select members from the three bureaus of Public Works, Port Affairs, and Finance to conduct preliminary measurements of the sea water depth, tide, soil saturation, the depth of the hard bottom in the bay, and the exact area of ​​the bay, and to jointly investigate the economic needs of all parties with the Railway Bureau, plan the future street layout, and make a plan, and then plan the funding and implement the construction in stages. A map is attached to the meeting. It was submitted to the second meeting on the 12th of this month for discussion. It was agreed that this proposal is of great importance to the future development of the city, and should be forwarded to the President for adoption. However, the original opinion proposed to organize a committee to conduct preliminary measurements. It was decided that in addition to selecting members from the three bureaus of Public Works, Port Affairs, and Finance, personnel from the Observatory should be added to form a joint organization, which would be more perfect. In addition, Committee Member Ding Jingchen temporarily moved that if a branch line could be built from the Jiaoji Railway to Zhan Mountain, more suitable land could be obtained, and a new wharf could be built there. Compared with Committee Member Yuan's proposal to fill the sea, which is more appropriate in terms of economic and factual aspects, it seems necessary to study in detail. This committee believes that Committee Member Ding's motion has a valuable value and should be submitted together for reference. All the reasons for suggesting to fill the concave bay on the northeast side of the breakwater in the big port and organizing a committee to conduct preliminary measurements are hereby submitted together with the original proposal and map of Committee Member Yuan Daochong for your review. (September 8).</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Opening of the Appeal Hearing for the Zhuiing Child Murder Case</p>
<p>The appeal case of the child murder in Zhuiing, Songjiang, was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Judge Zhao Zhengtang, Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo, clerks, and other court officials took their seats in the first courtroom. First, Wang Tao was called, and her age and origin were asked. Then, she was asked if she had committed any crimes before, to which she replied that she had not. Next, Xia Aqing, Zhang Mama, and others were asked their ages, origins, and addresses before being dismissed to the side. Wang Tao was asked, "You killed Diqing. What are you dissatisfied with that you are appealing?" She replied, "Diqing was my own son. Of the two sons I bore, the younger one died young. Only Diqing remained. How could I kill him? Do you not think about who would carry my head and see me off after my death?" She was asked, "Was Diqing your own son?" She replied, "Yes. He had already married a woman from the Chen family of Nanqiao as his wife and had a son and a daughter." She was asked, "How many years has your husband been dead?" She replied, "Fifteen years. Diqing was only eight years old at that time." She was asked, "Did you arrange the marriage?" She replied, "Yes." She was asked, "Did he usually do any work?" She replied, "No, he studied at school." She was asked, "Was your son usually well-behaved?" She replied, "People say he was bad, but I relied on him. I cannot say he was bad. I depended on him for my livelihood." She was asked, "How much money did he spend?" She replied, "A lot." She was asked, "How much?" She replied, "He sold several mu of land." She was asked, "What was its value?" She replied, "Two or three hundred dollars." She was asked, "How many people are there in your family in total?" She replied, "Zhang Mama, Wang Yutian, my daughter-in-law, and myself, five people in total." She was asked, "What does Xia Aqing do at your place?" She replied, "He is a mason, helping out at my house." She was asked, "What about Wang Yutian?" She replied, "He is an accountant, my husband's younger brother." She was asked, "Does he live in your house?" She replied, "He comes and goes, it's not fixed. After my husband died, I asked him to come and take care of things." She was asked, "What is your relationship with him?" She replied, "He is my husband's younger brother." She was asked, "Where does he stay when he's at your house?" She replied, "He is in the back, I am in the front." She was asked, "Do you live together?" She replied, "No. You can investigate." She was asked, "How many people sleep in each room?" She replied, "Zhang Mama sleeps with my grandson. My room is at the front." She was asked, "Has Wang Yutian ever lived with you?" She replied, "No." She was asked, "What about eating meals?" She replied, "We sit at the same table, it doesn't matter among family." She was asked, "Zhang Mama said you slept together?" She replied, "Heaven is above, earth is below. My husband has been dead for more than thirty years. If we had slept together, wouldn't we have had children? I am still completely chaste." She was asked, "The neighbors all say you have a relationship with him?" She replied, "They are just talking nonsense." She was asked, "What was the relationship between Diqing and his wife like?" She replied, "Not good, not bad." She was asked, "How exactly did your son die?" She replied, "I was in the front building and rarely went to the back building, so I don't know." She was asked, "When did you first learn of his death?" She replied, "The child had a fever and chills. I went to call him and that's when I found out." She was asked, "How did you see he had died?" She replied, "I cried and fainted, I didn't know." She was asked, "Was he killed by someone, or did he commit suicide?" She replied, "In my confusion, I couldn't tell." She was asked, "Did he die in bed or somewhere else?" She replied, "He hanged himself in the back half of the room." She was asked, "So he hanged himself?" She replied, "Yes." She was asked, "Did anyone come that night?" She replied, "I usually don't pay attention to people coming and going. I don't care about that." She was asked, "Was Xia Aqing at your house?" She replied, "He was outside, not at my house." She was asked, "What about Zhang Mama?" She replied, "She was sleeping with my grandson at my place." She was asked, "Did you ask Mama when he died?" She replied, "I didn't ask." She was asked, "Why did he commit suicide?" She replied, "He was outside, I don't know what he did." She was asked, "What did he do outside?" She replied, "I can't say." She was asked, "Was there an autopsy after his death?" She replied, "I was inside and heard that there was an autopsy." She was asked, "Did the autopsy show that he hanged himself?" She replied, "I was already arrested at that time, how could I know?" She was asked, "You said he hanged himself, but the autopsy showed he was strangled to death, and there were many wounds on his body. He was strangled to death and then made to look like he hanged himself." She replied, "I don't understand." She was asked, "He was your own son, and it happened in your own house. How could you not understand?" She was asked, "Did he have any enemies outside?" She replied, "I don't know about what he did outside." She was asked, "In the Jinshan County Government, you admitted that you, Xia Aqing, and Zhang Mama wanted to get 1,000 dollars from Diqing because you thought he was wasting money, so you killed him." She replied, "They scared me. I never confessed." The judge then brought up the interrogation records from Jinshan County Government. Wang Tao repeatedly denied confessing, saying, "They are falsely accusing me." The judge then said, "Since you confessed, why are you denying it?" She remained silent. She was asked, "So, was it Wang Yutian and Xia Aqing who killed him?" She replied, "Yutian only had this one nephew, how could he kill him?" She was asked, "Xia Aqing confessed that Wang Yutian and you instructed him to kill Diqing." She replied, "That's a false accusation." She was asked, "Why did Wang Yutian flee?" She replied, "He wasn't there at the time. Later, when he came back, people told him to run, so he fled." Next, Xia Aqing was interrogated. He was asked, "What are your reasons for disagreeing and appealing here?" He replied, "I was sipping tea in a teahouse. I was wrongly accused." He was asked, "Were you present when Diqing died?" He replied, "No." He was asked about his occupation. He replied, "Mason. First, I built a house for the Wang family, and then I became their servant." He was asked, "Do you live at their house?" He replied, "Yes, together." He was asked, "For how many years?" He replied, "Six years." He was asked, "How many servants are there in total?" He replied, "Four people." He was asked, "What does Wang Yutian do at their house?" He replied, "Accountant." He was asked, "Where does he live at their house?" He replied, "The back building." He was asked, "Does he sleep in the same room as Wang Tao?" He replied, "I don't go upstairs, I don't know." He was asked, "What was the relationship between the mother and son like?" He replied, "Very good. Was Diqing very wasteful?" He replied, "Yes." He was asked, "What did he use the money for?" He replied, "He liked to play around." He was asked, "How many times did the mother and son quarrel?" He replied, "I don't know." He was asked, "What about with Yutian?" He replied, "Last year, Diqing kicked Yutian out." He was asked, "Did Wang Tao and Yutian have a relationship?" He replied, "I don't know." He was asked, "What about with you?" He replied, "No." The judge then stated that he had already confessed in the Jinshan County Government, so why was he retracting his confession? Xia then confessed that Wang Tao was the mastermind. Next, Zhang Mama was interrogated. According to her testimony, she was holding the grandson when she went to Diqing's room and already saw Diqing's body lying on the bed. She requested to be exonerated. Next, the deceased's wife, Chen Zhaoying, was questioned and requested a settlement. Next, the witnesses Wang Shuzan, Chen Jianquan, Xu Tangrong (clerk of Chongyu Bank), and the young maid were brought in. Prosecutor Zhu argued that the appeals of all parties were without merit. Wang Tao's lawyer, Gu Hongzhang, Xia's lawyer, Shen Yong, and Zhang Mama's lawyer, Yang Jipeng, then presented their arguments. The court announced that the arguments were concluded and the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>Wang Monian and His Wife Committed Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Wang Monian, who was just over twenty years old and had previously founded the Thunderbolt News, and his wife, Chen Jinzhen, committed suicide by drowning in the Chusheng Bridge inside Loumen at 8 PM on the 10th because he had been unemployed for a long time and was having difficulty making a living. By the time bystanders noticed and called for help to pull them out, it was too late. The local constable reported the incident to the District Attorney's Office, which dispatched officers to investigate yesterday afternoon (the 11th). While the investigation was ongoing, Wang Chunquan, the father of Wang Monian, arrived and requested that the investigation be waived. He prepared coffins for the burial.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Extension of the Deadline for Payment of Silver Tax by One Month</p>
<p>The First and Second National Tax Collection Offices of this county originally set the deadline for collecting the land tax in silver at August 31st. However, due to slow tax collection, the Finance Bureau submitted a request to the Finance Department, asking for an extension of one month to facilitate tax collection. On the 7th, the Finance Department replied by telegram, approving an extension of one month from the date of the order. A public notice was immediately issued, stating that payment of silver tax would be extended from the 7th of this month to the 7th of October, and late fees would be waived.</p>
<p>The Ding and Wu Families in Qiujing Were Robbed</p>
<p>At around 11 PM last night (the 10th), more than ten robbers speaking a local dialect broke into the home of Ding Zhenyang in Qiujing Township, in the second district of this county. The robbers guarding outside fired shots as a warning. Clothing and other items were stolen. The home of Wu Shunyu, who lived in the same residence, was also affected. The robbers fled with their loot. After the incident, investigators found spent Gao Sheng firecrackers on the ground, indicating that the robbers had used the firecrackers to intimidate the victims.</p>
<p>Arrest of Bandit Leader Yu Guihe</p>
<p>Yu Guihe, who previously served as captain of an anti-smuggling patrol boat in the Suzhou region, had been serving under Taibao Ashu as an alternate battalion commander after leaving his post. He participated in robberies in various cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. He recently returned to his hometown, where he was discovered and arrested by Fang, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Security Corps. He confessed to the crimes. He has been handed over to the Pacification Sub-district Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Unmarried Village Woman Pregnant, Foreman Expelled</p>
<p>Wang Xinyuan, a resident of Pingchao Lou Village in the second district of this county, had no sons. He had only one daughter named Haibao, whom he adopted to continue the family line. He intended to arrange a marriage for his daughter, but her fiancé was unattractive and stubborn. She had an affair with the foreman, Jiang Faquan. Lately, Haibao's belly had grown large, and her mother discovered the secret. She was confined to a room, and the Water Police Team of Jiaoli was notified to arrest Jiang. After someone posted bail, he was expelled from the area.</p>
<p>Qibao Party Affairs Transferred to County Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Qibao's Party affairs were transferred to Shanghai Special Municipality in 1927. The County Rectification Committee felt it was inappropriate for Party and government affairs to be under different jurisdictions. Local Party members requested that Party affairs be transferred back to county control. The County Rectification Committee submitted a request to the Provincial Rectification Committee, which was forwarded to the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters. A representative will be sent soon to take over and return the area to county jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Student Protest Against Principal Zhang Spreads</p>
<p>More than four hundred students at Nanjing Middle School are protesting against Principal Zhang Zhongyou's mismanagement. On the 8th, the Student Union passed a resolution requesting the Education Department and the School Board to dismiss Principal Zhang. Zhang has left the school and gone to the Education Department to seek instructions. The executive board members decided to request the Principal to return to the school promptly. It was decided that on the 10th the school will organize a student body meeting where Principal Zhang Zhongyou, Accountant Xue Mengyuan, and Teacher Xue Ruchung would address the students. If a concrete solution is not reached by the 15th, all the teachers and staff would collectively resign. It was decided to retain Xue Ruchong and Xue Mengyuan, and they will be requested to remain in their positions. Yesterday morning (the 10th), Chief of Discipline Sun Xuefang, Dean of Studies Xue Xiaosheng, Teacher Liu Minfan and others summoned all the students to a disciplinary talk. Sun Xuefang claimed that this movement was incited by a small number of students, and did not represent the consensus of the majority. He said the movement was illegal. Before he could finish, the students became angry and disgruntled. Gao Qingyue and others spoke in refutation, noting that Director Sun was present during the general assembly and supported the motion. He had witnessed over three hundred and thirty students agreeing to the motion. Regarding the allegation that the motion was illegal, he could explain the eight charges brought against Principal Zhang. The students applauded loudly. The executive committee ordered over three hundred students to form ranks and proceed to the county government to petition County Magistrate Peng. The representatives explained the situation to Magistrate Peng in detail, and Peng offered his earnest advice. He asked the students to follow school rules and attend class. He would travel to Nanjing tomorrow (the 11th) to attend the School Board meeting and address the situation. The students then returned to school and gathered at the playground, where they were asked to sign their names if they supported the dismissal of Principal Zhang, so as to avoid the accusation of being manipulated by a minority. Three hundred and sixty students signed their names. Due to these events, classes were suspended in the morning, and the teachers and staff held another joint meeting. Since classes could not proceed as scheduled, students remained in their classrooms studying. Classes resumed as usual in the afternoon, but the protest against Principal Zhang remained unresolved.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Provincial Office Orders County to Stop Recruiting Soldiers</p>
<p>The county government previously received a letter from Zhang Zheng, commander of the 49th Division of the Army, and the recruiting committee member Qian Baorong came to Wuxi to recruit new soldiers, requesting that the Public Security Bureau provide assistance. Magistrate Chen had previously received a provincial order prohibiting the recruitment of new soldiers in prosperous commercial ports along the Yangtze River. He inquired with the Civil Affairs Office regarding recruitment, and a telegram was received stating that the provincial government had instructed Tongshan and other counties in the former Xu Prefecture to serve as recruiting regions. The coastal areas of the Yangtze River are prosperous commercial ports where recruiting is prohibited. The county has been ordered to adhere to the ordinance and recruit soldiers in the former Xu Prefecture. Magistrate Chen has informed Commander Zhang of the order and directed the Public Security Bureau to persuade Committee Member Qian to cease recruiting. The cocoon industry is opening and prices are being aggressively bidded up. This year's spring cocoon harvest was disastrous, and silk factories are relying on the autumn cocoon harvest. Factories have been making preparations. Due to flooding, only 50% of the autumn cocoons will yield a harvest. The silk markets are sluggish. If prices continue to increase, silk factory profits will decline. Many companies could become stranded. If this is not stopped, factories will fail. The Silk Industry Association has convened an emergency meeting to suppress cocoon prices. The association has chartered many petrol boats, and representatives will be sent to convince the different factories not to aggressively bid.</p>
<p>Provincial Office Orders Strict Collection of Cocoon Industry Business Tax</p>
<p>The Provincial Finance Office has instructed each county to collect the business tax of each industry. The business tax for cocoons had yet to be collected, but this spring's cocoon yields were not good, and traders, because of the temporary nature of the tax, often underreported business numbers or smuggled cocoon bales, or even closed cocoon businesses. Tax revenue was meager, and the public suffered great losses. The autumn cocoon crop is about to come on the market. The county should collect taxes and turn them in at once, in accordance with the regulations. Moreover, at the exit points of cocoon producing counties, the collection agency should assign a temporary investigator to register the number of cocoon bales leaving the country for each cocoon company, so as to verify the business tax with each cocoon company, to prevent smuggling, concealment, and underreporting. This measure has been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record and has been ordered to be implemented by the county offices. Wang Shutang, Director of Wuxi Business Tax Bureau, has instructed the Chamber of Commerce to inform the Silk Industry Association, and will hand in the assessed tax of 1,500 dollars for the summer and autumn seasons.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Investigation Confirms Rape of Six-Year-Old Girl</p>
<p>Zhang Baozhen, a six-year-old adopted daughter of Zhang Sun of Xiaoweitou Village, the ninth district of Wuyi County, was raped by Wang Suode, a seventeen-year-old neighbor. Afterward, Zhang Sun discovered the incident and filed a lawsuit in the County Court. The Prosecutor's Office summoned both parties to court and dispatched an official to examine Baozhen, who confirmed that her hymen was torn, her labia were swollen, and her hymen had been broken, indicating that she had been raped. The prosecutor drafted an indictment and submitted it to the Criminal Court for public trial on the 10th.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Sends Representatives to Purchase Winter Clothing</p>
<p>Wang Shanbei and Feng Zhixiang, representatives from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, arrived in Changzhou on the 10th to purchase 11,000 sets of winter clothing. If they could not find enough clothing, they would travel to Suzhou to purchase additional sets.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Soy Sauce Industry Association Strives for Sales of Pickles</p>
<p>The Soy Sauce Industry Association of Jiangdu County stated that the Zhenjiang Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Team had stopped the sale of Jiangdu pickles at the Xinyuan distribution point on Yinshanmen Street in Zhenjiang, seizing 584 cans of Simei and Su Dachang pickles and fining the shop owner, Zhang Shutang, 120 dollars. Dechang pickles were also seized at the Yiyou store on the riverside. A meeting was held, and representatives Zhao Pinchen and Xu Houqing were elected and introduced by Tang Shou. They proposed to the presidium of the Second Provincial Congress of Jiangsu Province to maintain domestic goods and forward a request to the Zhejiang Transportation Office to punish the team and prohibit it from stopping the transportation and sale of Yangzhou pickle cans and from conducting searches and imposing fines. They also planned to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Bureau to maintain domestic production and prevent harassment of merchants.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Second District Water Police Return to He after Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>The Second District Water Police of Jiaxing received a report that several bandit ships were near Miaoqian, on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. District Chief Zhou immediately boarded the Zhiguo warship and led the patrol team to the area. Before reaching Miaoqian, they encountered the bandits, and both sides opened fire. After a fierce battle, the bandits, outnumbered, swam away to escape. Many bandits died in the river. Water police officers Jin Liansheng and Chen Wenbo were killed by gunfire in the battle. Yu Hongsheng, a hostage from Wujiang who was abducted by the bandits on the 24th of August, was rescued. One bandit ship and two guns were seized. The water police who suppressed the bandits have returned to He, and the hostage remains at the district headquarters for his family to reclaim. The Second District Water Police also apprehended bandit kidnappers Yu Zhifa, Yu Bingnan (also known as Yu Yutang), and Wu Yousheng (also known as Wu Yousan) in Dingjia, Jiashan County. Eight Ni family hostages from Hongjiatan were rescued. The three bandits were handed over to the Jiashan County Government for interrogation. With the approval of the Provincial Government via telegraph, the three bandits were executed by firing squad at the scene of the crime yesterday.</p>
<p>Weicheng Factory Workers Petition Party and Government</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, over one hundred workers from the Yujia branch of Jiaxing Weicheng Company sent representatives to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to petition for the implementation of the Factory Law and an increase in wages. Zhu Zhenfan, a standing member of the Party Headquarters, and Gong Shinong, the County Magistrate, gave speeches on the necessity of cooperation between labor and capital. They accepted the petitions and stated that they would separately petition the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters for the full implementation of the Factory Law.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The Case of Foreign Bees Harming Rice Crops Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>After the conflict between the Pingyuan Bee Farm in Hanmiao Township and the farmers due to the bees damaging the rice crops, the same incident occurred with the farmers in Xiaoxiao Bridge. Although the County Government issued a notice prohibiting unauthorized relocation, on the one hand, the director of the bee farm was ordered to move out of the area immediately. Sun, the director of the bee farm, argued that bees can pollinate plants, and promoting beekeeping can provide farmers with a secondary source of income and is beneficial, not harmful. Yesterday (the 9th), he moved the beehives to the city to appeal to the County Magistrate and request a solution. However, the farmers strongly opposed it and filed a petition with the County Government, demanding compensation for damages. County Magistrate Wu was in a difficult position, and no suitable solution has been found.</p>
<p>A Notorious Bandit Captured</p>
<p>Since the arrest of Lu Yaosheng, a key member of Taibao Ashu's bandit gang in Pinghu Eastern Township, his followers have scattered. However, his subordinate, the notorious bandit Shen Asi (also known as Long-Legged Asi), who was Lu's vanguard, has been hiding in Wangwan Township in the western part of Zhapu, which belongs to Haiyan County, under the guise of selling smuggled salt. The Pinghu Jin Sinang Bridge Security Corps discovered his hiding place and ordered platoon leader Shen Daosheng to lead over a dozen members, disguised as salt smugglers, and cooperate with County Government bailiff Chen to go to the area. They captured him in a broken house on the afternoon of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Bandits Who Robbed Yuyao Fast Boat Confess Accomplices</p>
<p>Fei Zhaosheng (from Sheng County), one of the bandits who robbed a Yuyao fast boat, confessed, after interrogation by the County Government, that Duan, a squad leader from a certain team stationed in the eastern township of this county, and squad leader Zhao were also involved. The county sent a message to the Fifth Battalion in Baiguan, which transferred Duan and Zhao to the county for interrogation on the 8th.</p>
<p>Remnants of Bandit Forces Occupy Dalanshan</p>
<p>The remnants of Shen Yongshou's bandit forces, recently under heavy attack by various units of the Sixth Regiment of the Security Corps, have retreated into Dalanshan, where they are robbing nearby villages to survive.</p>
<p>Soldiers from the Song County Defense Team Extort Money</p>
<p>Chen, a detective from the Song County Defense Team, colluded with a deputy squad leader and soldiers Lou Hongfu, Hu Maochang, and Wang Shouji to extort money from Pan Shuqing in Beihu, Western Township, last month. Pan had been wanted for a previous crime. Wang Xiaoben, Wang Futang, Lian Ruisheng, and others mediated and arranged for Pan to pay 400 dollars to settle the matter. It was also reported that Zhang received over a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Construction Office Sends Representatives to Test Caojiang Water Power for the Second Time</p>
<p>The Construction Office previously sent representatives to Yu to test the water power of the Caoe River, but the water level was too low. After the typhoon and heavy rain in this county, the water level rose sharply. The Construction Office sent four representatives, including Fan and Ge, to Zhangzhen in southern Yu to conduct tests between the Yue Temple and the Guangfu Temple on the opposite side of the river. The testing site in the middle reaches of the Cao River was 118 meters wide and 5-6 meters deep. The rate and resistance of the water will be precisely calculated upon returning to the province, before the results are released.</p>

<p>Today's Predictions for Men's and Women's Track and Field Preliminary and Final Rounds</p>
<h3>Men's Finals</h3>
<p>▲Discus Throw: Shanghai is lagging behind in the progress of various track and field sports. Only the discus throw event has progressed very slowly. Each time, in the sports meeting, the progress has not been good. After investigating, although there are thirteen people participating in the finals of the discus throw event, which is the first final of today's city sports meeting, there is a lack of good generals. According to past results, Wang Jihuai, Chen Baoqiu, Cao Yu, Xie Quanhe, and Luo Chuanxian, and Fu Hongxing are the best performers. However, Wang Jihuai injured the back of his foot with running shoe nails during practice at Jinan University, and it has been festering for a long time, making it difficult for him to walk for almost two weeks. Although he has fully recovered, he has been lacking in practice for a long time, and his results will inevitably be slightly inferior. Chen Baoqiu's performance has been good and bad, sometimes throwing 34 or 35 meters, sometimes throwing around 30 meters. This is probably due to a lack of experience. Recently, it has been said that Mr. Chen has been suffering from malaria for more than a day, so his energy has been greatly reduced. It is still questionable whether he can participate today. The other four, Cao, Xie, Luo, and Fu, have similar results. Cao and Xie may be able to compete for positions because they are more experienced. However, it has been said that Mr. Luo has been progressing very quickly recently.</p>
<p>▲Long Jump: Among the forty-three people, those competing for the final right are none other than Wang Jihuai, Hao Chunde, Chen Gongyu, Zhong Lianji, Li Lin, and Wu Jinqi. Wang Jihuai and Lang Chunde are more likely to win the championship. However, Wang Jihuai has just recovered from a foot injury. Although he may be able to win the championship, it is expected that he will not be able to achieve the results he jumped in the Jiangda Sports Meeting in the first half of the year. Chen and Zhong's performance in competing for positions will also be considerable and will not be too far behind Wang and Lang. Mr. Li can often jump to about 6.20 meters, but due to his physique, it is difficult for him to have an amazing performance. Mr. Wu has excellent arch elasticity, but he is prone to muscle strain when long jumping. According to the reporter's opinion, Mr. Wu can give up long jumping and concentrate on high jumping to win the championship. I wonder what Mr. Wu thinks.</p>
<p>▲High Jump: There are also as many as twenty-five people participating in the high jump, but it is expected that at least three-fifths of them will be eliminated before 1.60 meters. The final winners will be Wu Jinqi, Li Lin, and Gu Yu. Wu and Li both use the Horahine jumping method. Since the new rules were adopted, both have felt quite disadvantaged. Comparing the two, Mr. Li is even more disadvantaged. Mr. Gu's jumping method is excellent, but due to his height, it is extremely difficult for him to make further progress. Wu Jinqi accompanied the Jiangnan team on its northern expedition during the summer vacation. When competing against Luhe in Beiping, it was said that he was only one level behind Li Junzhong when competing for first place, and was ranked second. On that day, Mr. Li's score was 1.84 meters. It is estimated that Mr. Wu's score is at least 1.80 meters. If so, Mr. Wu seems more confident in winning the high jump championship.</p>
<h3>Women's Finals</h3>
<p>▲ Long Jump</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the registry of the Bureau of Education, a check of the entire list of female applicants revealed that two-thirds were students from women's sports schools. However, statistically, students from women's sports schools account for less than one-tenth of the total number of female athletes in Shanghai's middle and higher schools. This shows the lack of popularity of women's sports in other schools, which is a sign of the depression of women's sports in the city. As for the scores in various women's track and field events, it is difficult to predict at this early stage, and upsets are very likely. Based on past women's long jump results in Shanghai, Ms. Zhang Ping, Qian Hangsu, and Chen Yunqing are the most promising. However, the reporter hopes that a new player with amazing results will defeat the old players in today's city games and create a new record. It is hoped that this kind of news will be heard repeatedly in this sports meet.</p>
<p>▲ High Jump</p>
<p>The women's high jump is the most immature aspect of women's sports. Not to mention the performance, even the jumping posture is not correct in one out of a hundred attempts. Having traveled all over Shanghai, I have not seen a beautiful high jump posture. However, based on the high jump results of female students in secondary schools in the first half of the year, Ms. Zhang Baojin, Yang Zhiren, and Sun Xiaoxia should be considered the best. Because Ms. Zhang, Yang, and Sun have won positions, and Ms. Zhang even created a new record of 1.26 meters in the immature category. However, this situation can easily change. What kind of situation will be created in today's game is beyond the reporter's intelligence to predict. I only hope that the ladies will strive to compete. Victory or defeat is not important, but progress in performance is the most important.</p>
<h3>Men's Preliminaries</h3>
<p>▲ 100-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>Everyone in Shanghai who emphasizes the short sprint highlights Zhong Liantai, Hao Chunde, Gu Zaiping, Zhou Ende, Lin Guangyu, and He Debao. It is undoubtedly true that these six gentlemen are listed at the top of the six groups in today's preliminary rounds. However, Mr. Lin Guangxing of Shanghai College suffered from diarrhea a few days ago. Although he gradually recovered yesterday, his muscles have become thin and his spirit is weak. Yesterday, the reporter saw Mr. Peng Sanmei, the director of physical education at Shanghai College, and asked for his opinion. According to him, he plans to let him participate in the preliminary round to see how the results of the first preliminary round will be and then make a decision based on the situation. The reporter recalled the previous Jiangda Games, when Wang Jihuai of Guanghua was in the same situation as Mr. Lin. At that time, he was persuaded to value his health and not to force himself to participate. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang won three championships in the two-day games, winning the first place in the long jump, triple jump, and javelin events. The javelin also set a new record for Jiangda. Those who watched the game in the arena laughed and said, "Wang Jihuai was sick but bravely challenged An Dianbao, and one shot broke the old record." The reporter hopes that Mr. Lin can be like Mr. Wang today, becoming a miraculous Taibao despite his illness.</p>
<p>▲ 200-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>The four great generals, Zhong, Hao, Gu, and Zhou, should be able to make a splash in the 200-meter preliminary round. Mr. Lin Guangxing could have competed with the four great generals, but after the diarrhea, it is feared that it will be difficult to compete for victory. However, there is a rising star, Mr. Zeng Rongzhong of Jinan, who can be considered a strong enemy of the four. Let us wait and see.</p>
<p>▲ 400-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>At the previous Wan Guo Games, the Chinese team members of the 1600-meter relay, Zeng Rongzhong, He Debao, Su Zuqing, and Wang Jianwu, can control the situation in the four preliminary rounds. Among them, Mr. Wang Jianwu is thirty-seven years old, which is older, but his spirit is still undiminished from his heyday (fifteen years ago) at the Jiangsu Provincial Games. Moreover, his results are also improving with age. However, although he has been practicing diligently this year, his results are not as good as last year. It is thought that the relationship between age and energy is powerless.</p>
<p>▲ 800-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>As many as fifty-seven people have joined the 800-meter race. Some say that a quarter of them will not show up for the race. Among those who show up, half will not be able to run the entire distance. Therefore, this preliminary round is rarely exciting. In terms of results, Chen Xingpei in the first group and Qiu Lingru in the second group are better, and the rest are average.</p>
<p>▲ 1500-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>Among the sixty-three contestants, the reporter dares to say that at least some of them are speculative. Their purpose is to obtain an athlete's badge by joining the competition, not to improve their skills. Whether this is the case remains to be confirmed by roll call in today's preliminary round. The reporter speculates on their psychology. Other sports are not easy to fake, but only middle-distance running, such as the 1500 meters and 10,000 meters, etc., in the first and second laps, anyone can follow. When the original strength cannot continue, they will withdraw halfway, or claim to have a stomachache, or claim to have a foot pain. All kinds of strange phenomena are everywhere. At this point, they think that the responsibility of joining the sports meet is over. They put on their clothes, wear their badges, and run around, causing such goods to be everywhere. In the past, there have also been Boy Scouts who came forward to intervene. They all said that they were athletes. The habit has been like this for a long time. However, today's city athletes will not have to pay registration fees, which will make it even worse. Although this is said, I hope that those who join the 1500-meter race will not be included in the reporter's preliminary predictions. Everyone can come to the competition and run the entire distance. The 1500 meters is one of the most lacking talents in Shanghai. The best result is finally around 4 minutes and 30 seconds, which is far from the comparison with Liaoning. In the four groups of races, Zhang Hugen is the most confident in the first group, Zhou Bin is very hopeful in the second group, Chen Xingpei will definitely be selected in the third group, and Qiu Lingru can control the victory in the fourth group. However, the reporter deeply hopes that new talents will appear in each group and not let the old generals occupy the beauty for a long time.</p>
<p>▲ Middle and High Hurdles Preliminary</p>
<p>Hurdling is not easy, so not many people join the competition. There are only fifteen people in the high hurdles and only seventeen people in the middle hurdles. Among the high hurdles, Cao Yu's results are the best, followed by Tao Yingjie, Zhou Shaowen, and Chen Buzhang. Mr. Chen Guoquan, who won the first place in the high hurdles at the Wan Guo Games in the spring, has not joined this time, for some reason. Among the middle hurdles, Tao Yingjie is the best, followed by Sun Huipei and Chen Buzhang. Chen Baoqiu may not be able to participate in this sport due to illness. Last night, it was also learned that Mr. Tao Yingjie, the holder of the middle hurdles record, has dampness in his feet, and I don't know if it will affect the results.</p>
<h3>Women's Preliminary</h3>
<p>▲ 50-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Pingxian, Sheng Bi, Ma Yufang, and Situ Wei are the most promising to win the championship in the preliminary rounds of each group.</p>
<p>▲ 100-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>Zhang Pingxian, Zhang Jingfang, Sheng Bi, Situ Wei, Zhu Wencheng, Pan Huilin, and others compete for the first place in each group. Among them, Ms. Zhang Pingxian's results should be the best.</p>
<p>▲ 200-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Jingfang is the best in the 200 meters, but whether she can maintain her previous results this year is still a question, because the age of women is related to sports. In addition, Situ Wei, Zhu Wencheng, Ma Yufang, Luo Huilin, and others are also good.</p>
<p>▲ Low Hurdles Preliminary</p>
<p>This sport is being pioneered in Shanghai this time and has not been competed before, so the results are still unknown.</p>

<p>▲ Begging for Relief</p>
<p>Disasters have befallen our people, and the victims of this flood are all over more than ten provinces. The old and weak have been abandoned in ditches, and the strong and young are waiting to be fed. Anyone with a little kindness cannot help but save money and donate generously. Our Boy Scouts follow the spirit of helping others anytime and anywhere, hoping to save those victims from deep water and fire. Therefore, this association has been organized. I hope that people from all walks of life will not shirk their responsibility, donate generously, and gather a little to make a lot, and accumulate sand to form a tower. Donating one yuan means saving one more life. The Boy Scouts who are donating along the way are all wearing uniforms and have donation team badges to help them identify. In addition to inviting party and government agencies to open the box publicly at Mu'er Hall, Xizang Road, Hankou Road the next day to show caution, the donated relief money will be transferred to the flood relief committees in various provinces for distribution. This announcement.</p>
<p>▲ Date of Opening the Box</p>
<p>The Boy Scout Group is scheduled to open the box at 10:00 am on the 13th of this month in the auditorium of Mu'er Hall on Xizang Road, and has sent letters to newspaper reporters and various agencies and groups to supervise the opening of the box to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Government Disaster Relief Committee held a standing committee meeting yesterday</p>
<p>The National Government Flood Relief Committee held its first plenary meeting on the 9th and decided to add 12 standing committee members (a total of 17 members).

Committee members Song Ziwen, Standing Committee members Zhu Qinglan, Zeng Hongpu, Liu Ruiheng, Yu Qiaqing, and foreign standing committee members Baker, Maxwell, Carney, and Funatsu, and others attended, totaling more than a dozen people. The discussion lasted for more than an hour, and it ended at 6:15 pm. As a result, it was decided to start shipping 30,000 tons this month, 60,000 tons next month (October), and 75,000 tons each month from November to February of next year, and 60,000 tons in March, totaling 450,000 tons.</p>
<p>▲ Allocation of Funds to Various Provinces</p>

<p>▲ Do Not Accept Various Proprietary Medicines</p>
<p>The Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee issued the following opinions on donated medicines: Many Chinese and foreign pharmaceutical companies and philanthropists have donated medical supplies and various medicines to the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group, which has greatly helped the health and epidemic prevention work in the disaster area. However, there are occasional donations of proprietary medicines, which are sometimes not entirely suitable for the needs of the disaster area, which may be a waste of the donor's good intentions. The group has issued statements in Chinese and foreign newspapers, welcoming donations of medicines listed in the pharmacopoeias of various countries. As for various proprietary medicines, we regret that we cannot accept them. If you have any questions about donating medicines, you can also contact the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the Flood Relief Committee on Jiujiang Road at any time to facilitate the matter.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou Red Cross Society Relief Work</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a report from the Yangzhou branch yesterday stating that after the dike collapse in northern Jiangsu, the branch convened a temporary emergency meeting on the 28th to discuss measures. It was resolved that attendees would raise 2,000 catties of sesame cakes and Jingjiang cakes, 400 bottles of wind-cold medicine, and publicly appoint Guo Shaoting, Ruan Yuren, and Chen Peiqiu to lead six laborers to the disaster area by hired boat to distribute the supplies and bring along corpse retrieval equipment to prepare for salvaging bodies. They departed on the 29th. When the boat reached the Liuzha area, the water was turbulent, making it difficult to proceed. Although there were bodies, they were difficult to retrieve. Only the roofs of houses on land could be seen, and only the tops of trees were visible. Countless people were clinging to rooftops and treetops. The dry food and medicine brought were immediately distributed to the victims, and 46 elderly, weak, men, and women were rescued (the boat could not carry more) and transported back to Yangzhou, where they were sent to the Changsheng Temple reception center. Recognizing that the victims' most urgent need was dry food, flyers were widely distributed to solicit various food items. As a result, 3,000 catties of scorched rice, fried rice, large cakes, and Jiang cakes were raised. On the 31st, Ruan and others took them to Shaobo Yi Guangda, where there were many victims and a shortage of medicine and food. They respectfully requested immediate assistance to save the people. After receiving the report, the society telegraphed a reply stating that it would soon dispatch staff member Bao Kangning, along with doctors and nurses, to the disaster area to do their utmost to provide rescue.</p>
<h3>Dire Situation in Disaster-Stricken Counties in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The Emergency Relief Association has recently received numerous reports, letters, and telegrams from various counties in northern Jiangsu reporting the true extent of the disaster and appealing for relief. Excerpts are listed separately below:</p>
<p>▲ In Gaoyou, four breaches occurred in the dikes in the areas of Qigongdian, Yumatou, Miaoxiangkou, and Danggjunlou north of the city, one after another, within a distance of two li, suddenly forming three islands. The width of the breaches ranged from dozens of zhang to twenty or thirty zhang, with the largest breach at Danggjunlou, reaching one hundred fifty or sixty zhang. South of the city, the breach at Ershilipu was approximately ninety zhang, and the breach at Sanshilipu was approximately sixty zhang. The various dikes in the four rural areas of the county were successively breached, and floating corpses were everywhere.</p>
<p>▲ In Taixian, the accumulated water reached eight or nine chi. The southeastern townships, which typically grew dry crops, were completely submerged. The four districts downstream, which were the county's largest rice-producing areas, were simultaneously submerged, regardless of whether they were high or low-lying areas. After the opening of the Guihai Three Dams, the water depth outside the inclined embankment weirs in the downstream districts was six or seven chi. After just two days, the en-weir breaches occurred, and the water volume inside the weirs was equal to that outside the weirs. Not only was the late rice submerged, but it would also rot after prolonged exposure. Even most of the houses in the villages collapsed, leaving more than 100,000 people homeless. Many elderly, weak, women, and children were unable to escape and drifted away, and entire families drowned in various places.</p>
<p>▲ Since the collapse of Guazhou on August 27th, all 60,000 mu of fields and 5,000 houses in the entire weir were instantly submerged, and 100,000 lives were in imminent danger. The young and strong climbed to the tops of trees, while the elderly, weak, women, and children drowned in the water. Now that the autumn winds have suddenly risen and the cold pierces the skin, the people have no clothing or food and will freeze and starve to death.</p>
<p>▲ After the opening of the Jiangdu Gaoyou Three Dams, the lakes of Ailing, Xingsi, Luyang, and Qingdang rose simultaneously. Four or five out of ten weirs near the lake were submerged. After the Shaobo Dam collapsed on the 26th of last month, there were a dozen or more breaches along the embankment from Beibanchang to Zha Sanli. The nearby villages and towns downstream, such as Liuzhuang, Mazhuang, and Xiaojie, were completely washed away. The towns of Qishumiao, Yangjiazhuang, Zhenwumiao, Dinggou, Yong'an Qiaoshu, Chenjiadian Dingjiahuo, and Gaoqiao were completely submerged. The surrounding weir fields, such as the Huti Weir, Qishu Weir, Guangfeng Weir, Hefeng Weir, Tanjia Weir, Yangjiazhuang Weir, Zhenwumiao East Weir, and Zhang Shiliang Weir, were all completely submerged. The rice tips of the higher-lying fields without weirs in Shuixi Township, Zhoushu Township, Shao Xiannv Township, Yanshou Township, and Huanghua Township were completely submerged, and the rice ears of the shallow areas were slightly exposed above the water. A total of more than 20,000 mu of fields were submerged, affecting approximately 100,000 victims. The number of drowned people and animals could not be counted in the rush. Only floating corpses were seen drifting in the rivers and lakes, emitting a foul odor. Most of them flowed north to Gaoyou and Xinghua, and no one was retrieving or burying them.</p>
<p>The Jiangdu Seventh District Flood Relief Association issued an urgent notice stating that the district is east of Shaobo, directly facing the initial impact of the dike breaches at Liuzha and other places. The disaster situation is unbearable. Townships such as Qiaoshu, Dinggou, Dingjiahuo Yan, Huangshao, Shuizhou, and Hantang still have a water level of five or six chi. Victims are perched in trees and on rooftops, awaiting death. Because the area is remote, the relief supplies from major benefactors have mostly been transported to Shaobo for distribution, and the district has not received a drop of assistance. Although the major benefactors have donated a great deal of money, the victims in the district are still starving. In the future, if relief supplies are donated, please transport them from Xiannvmiao and Dahan directly to the Qiaoshu and Dinggou Flood Relief Offices for distribution to avoid being overlooked. Alternatively, please notify the Yangzhou Hotel in Nanliuxiang, and the association's Yangzhou office will send staff to distribute them in the disaster area. This notice was issued on September 7th.</p>
<p>▲ After the opening of the Xinghua Three Dams, the water depth on the plains reached one zhang, and all the fields in the territory were submerged, totaling 4 million mu. Each mu of good land was worth approximately 20 yuan, resulting in a total loss of approximately 80 million yuan. On August 26th, strong winds and heavy rain caused thousands of village weirs in the four rural areas to collapse. Whole villages were boarding boats. The Lao Weir, Zhong Weir, Shuifeng Weir, and Heta Weir in the northeastern townships, as well as the Laoren Weir and Sanjiao Weir connecting to Yancheng, were successively breached. Houses, livestock, and the newly harvested early rice were all swept away. There was not a single dry patch of land for over a hundred li in all directions. Even the highest point in the county seat was submerged to the waist. To this day, the dike breaches have not been closed, and the water level continues to rise by two or three cun each day. Winter is approaching, and tens of thousands of victims will succumb to hunger and cold.</p>
<h3>News from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Branch is Officially Established</p>
<p>The association received a letter from President Dai Xiangmen of the Chinese branch and President So Hing-yan of the Western branch of the Yangzhou branch, reporting that the Yangzhou branch was established on September 5th. The address is the Zhongfu Gospel Church on Duozijie Street in Yangzhou. Because many public groups have come to Yangzhou for relief distribution, it is difficult to reach everyone. The branch plans to focus on remote disaster areas, while also paying attention to the severely affected areas of Gaoyou and Shaobo, adhering to the principle of being pragmatic.</p>
<p>▲ Hongkou Donation Collection Agency</p>
<p>Because there are many enthusiastic donors from all walks of life, but those far away still suffer from inconvenience, the association has already asked the Nanshi branch of the Bank of China to collect donations on its behalf.

<h3>The Jiangyuan Warship Has Sunk</h3>
<p>Technicians Can Arrive Today</p>
<p>Still Possible to Salvage and Escape Danger</p>
<p>▲ Huge Hole</p>
<p>The Jiangyuan warship of the First Fleet of the Navy ran aground on a reef while chasing pirates in Xinghua Bay, Fuzhou. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Jiangyuan warship ran aground in the head cabin bottom, and there was a large hole of six or seven chi square in the reef. Sea water rushed into the cabin, first flooding the head cabin, and then affecting the second cabin. Although the soldiers in the ship tried their best to pump water, it was ineffective due to the excessive damage. Within three hours, the entire ship was submerged in sea water.</p>
<p>▲ Jiangyuan Warship Sinks in the Sea</p>
<p>Around 6 p.m., the engine room of the Jiangyuan warship was also flooded, the boiler went out, all the lights in the ship went out, and the machine stopped, unable to start. The rescue warship sent by Commander Chen Jiliang had arrived. The Jiangyuan warship captain took out some of the important documents, and at 6:30 p.m., the ship sank into the sea.</p>
<p>▲ Salvage in Progress</p>
<p>The salvage technicians and divers of the Mitsui Company, who were requested by the Naval Headquarters in Shanghai, can arrive in Fuzhou today. After inspecting Xinghua Bay, they will discuss salvage. According to reliable information, although the Jiangyuan sank, it was fortunately stranded on the reef and has not sunk to the bottom of the sea. It is still possible to salvage it. However, the hole is very large, and the repair and salvage costs will require more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Ship Damage</p>
<p>The Jiangyuan warship was built at the Nagasaki Mitsubishi Shipyard. The entire ship is made of steel plates, with a displacement of 700 tons. The cost, including the interior layout, was 1 million yuan. The ship has only been built for 15 years. At the current gold price, 1 million is not enough. The personal belongings of the officers and soldiers in the ship have not been retrieved, and the losses are also significant.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled from Mexico Return to China</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai on the 28th</p>
<p>A wave of anti-Chinese sentiment has occurred in Mexico, and our overseas Chinese have suffered heavy losses. They have now withdrawn from Mexico and are returning to their homeland by ship. The first batch of overseas Chinese departing from Mexico for Shanghai totaled 184 people, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. They have taken a ship to New York and transferred to the Dalai Shipping Company's President Monroe ship to return to Shanghai. According to a telegram received yesterday, the batch of overseas Chinese has arrived in San Francisco and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 9 a.m. on the 28th of this month. It is heard that some of them will land in Shanghai, and some will disembark in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Chinese Not Allowed to Go to Japan</h3>
<p>Obstructed and Expelled</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Passengers to Japan Obstructed: Since Japan recognized Shanghai as a port with epidemic diseases, the restrictions on Chinese people going to Japan are extremely strict, and the inspection is very severe. Third-class passengers are not allowed to go to Yokohama, and large mail ships do not carry Chinese people. This time, the Japanese postal company's ship Kasado Maru went to Japan, and among the Shanghai Chinese passengers on board, there were thirty-five Chinese sailors hired by British ships and more than ten Chinese travelers. Unexpectedly, when the ship arrived at Moji, one of the sailors named Ren Haixiang vomited in the ship due to seasickness. The Japanese ship doctor considered it to be real cholera and did not allow all Chinese passengers on the ship to go ashore. They were detained on the sea surface outside Moji Port for seven days and nights and subjected to various unbearable examinations. Other Chinese people who did not vomit were also implicated and have not been released yet.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese People Expelled from Returning to Japan: Chinese people Chen Zhikui, Sun Yushan, Pan Caixing, Mei Louren, Wu Xiangyao, and Doctor Yang, etc., were engaged in the kimono business in Japan. This time, they went to Japan from Shanghai. When they arrived at a port in Japan, the Japanese maritime police did not allow any Chinese people to go ashore and expelled them back to their home country. The travel expenses and ship tickets of each person were deducted by the shipping company according to the amount of the prepaid deposit, so the expelled people suffered a great loss.</p>
<h3>Euro-Asia No. 2 Airplane Pilot and Mechanic Released</h3>

As for the Euro-Asia No. 2 airplane, Outer Mongolia has not returned it.</p>
<h3>Regular Flights on the Beijing-Ping Line Resumed</h3>
<p>Flights Between the Two Places on the Morning of the 17th of This Month</p>
<p>The resumption date of the China Aviation Corporation's Beijing-Ping line was originally scheduled for the 22nd of last month, but it was postponed again because most of the route was obstructed by water. A few days ago, the company sent Nie Kaiyi, the director of the flight crew, by plane to the north to inspect the current situation of the stations along the route. Yesterday (the 11th) morning, Mr. Nie telegraphed the company from Ping, reporting that there was no standing water at the stations along the route, and all the necessary equipment at each station was ready, so regular flights could be resumed immediately. After receiving the telegram, the company, led by Secretary He Zhijing, discussed the resumption date of the Beijing-Ping line and decided to start flights between Beijing and Ping on the morning of the 17th of this month. The aircraft currently flying, there are four Stinson-type aircraft at the Longhua Main Station in Shanghai, all of which have been repaired. On the 14th and 15th of this month, they will fly to Beijing Station to prepare for the resumption of flights. The resumption of flights will still be dedicated to carrying mail, and the date for carrying passengers has not yet been determined. Each flight will have two pilots, one to fly the plane and one as an assistant, all of whom are Chinese.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Counties Telegraphically Urge to Stop Opening the East Dam</h3>
<p>The East Dam, seventy miles west of Liyang County, is the lifeline of the Taihu Lake basin. Once opened, the provinces south of the Yangtze River will be submerged. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to drain the accumulated water from Gaoyou and Shaobo in northern Jiangsu, decided to open the East Dam. When the news came, the counties along Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces successively petitioned to stop it. The Shanghai Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association, the Pingjiang Guild Hall, the Dongting Xishan and Jinting Association Board of Directors, the Wuxi Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and the Dongting Dongshan Association Board of Directors in this city have all convened emergency meetings yesterday. After in-depth discussions, they all vowed to fight to the death to ensure the integrity of the dam and prevent it from being opened or collapsing.</p>
<h3>Hesheng Wheel Damaged and Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fearing Dangerous Accidents En Route</p>
<p>Matters of Life and Property are of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>After the Guang Sheng Wheel accident, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. purchased two Dutch wheels, named Xin Hesheng and Xin Mingsheng, each with 3,000 tons, to be dispatched to Shanghai to run the South China class to temporarily replace the Guang Sheng into ascending classes. This time, the Hesheng Wheel was loaded with a large number of goods from Shanghai, such as wheat flour, piece goods, cotton yarn, cigarettes, etc., and was heading to Hong Kong and Guangdong. There were also more than one hundred passengers on board. Unexpectedly, when the ship was halfway, the parts in its engine suddenly broke down. Upon inspection by the ship owner, it was determined that it could not sail. Deeply concerned that an extremely dangerous accident might occur en route, which would have a significant impact on the lives and property of the entire ship, they telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, reporting the return to Shanghai to repair the engine parts, and then set sail again to ensure safety. The ship is expected to arrive this morning. The goods will not be unloaded. The company has decided to send workers on board to complete the repairs and then set sail immediately.</p>
<h3>Peng Liren Reports on Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>Peng Liren, the Standing Committee Member of the County Executive Committee, reported to the Provincial Rectification Committee, stating, "Regarding the instructions from your committee No. 21076, to conduct a detailed investigation of the disaster situation and report it truthfully, etc., most of the farmland in this county is planted with cotton, and the rest is planted with rice. In mid-July of this year, continuous rainfall for more than ten days, just when the cotton was bearing fruit and the rice seedlings were growing, caused the cotton bolls to rot and the rice seedlings to be submerged due to excessive heat. Although not all of it was abandoned, according to the results of the investigation, the harvest is expected to be 60% less than in a bumper year. Extending to late August, a typhoon passed through Shanghai, and agricultural crops along the coast suffered another major blow. Based on the experience of farmers, the harvest this year, if there are no more disasters, may be only 10% to 20% of a good harvest. The losses, if estimated in silver dollars, would be about 200,000 yuan. The county is now actively seeking relief methods. In accordance with the previous order, this document is prepared for your review."</p>
<h3>Mulberry Trees Submerged in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Other Provinces</h3>
<p>The Ministry Orders Advance Planning</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry is investigating the damage to mulberry trees caused by water in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces to seek remedies. The order is as follows: "For the purpose of issuing orders, it is hereby notified that this year's rainfall has caused disasters. Most of the low-lying mulberry fields have been submerged, resulting in a poor mulberry leaf harvest. Autumn silkworms this year will suffer from a lack of feed. Those who plant silkworms cannot raise them, causing deep concern. However, the disaster that has already occurred is difficult to remedy, and the future harm should be prevented in advance. If mulberry trees are permanently submerged, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not wither due to waterlogging. A detailed investigation should be conducted in areas where mulberry trees have been damaged, and plans should be made early. More mulberry seedlings should be cultivated to prepare for replanting and maintain the silk industry. This order is hereby issued to the bureau to comply with and implement, and to submit the implementation details to the ministry for review as needed."</p>
<h3>Working Hours Issue in the Printing Industry</h3>
<p>Labor Concedes, Extends to Eight and a Half Hours</p>
<p>The printing industry union previously proposed amending the labor-management contract, which dragged on for two months. A work stoppage once occurred in the middle. The conditions have now been mediated by the Shanghai Social Bureau. As a result, regarding the issue of working hours, the labor side insisted on the original agreement of eight hours, while the management side still wanted to restore nine hours. The two sides argued fiercely, regarding it as the most important focus of all the conditions, so no agreement was signed. The union held a city-wide representative meeting yesterday to discuss working hours. All the representatives firmly upheld the original agreement of eight hours. After strenuous persuasion, it was decided to concede and extend the working hours to eight and a half hours, not to exceed that. It is unknown whether the management side will accept this.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Pier 5 Employees Present Seven Demands</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's unresolved case with the Pier 5 Employees Union is accumulating more and more. The Employees Union, repeatedly blamed by its members, has had no choice but to convene meetings to discuss and decide to present seven minimum demands to the head office, and to organize a Seven Demands Committee to take charge. The Seven Demands Committee has also met in recent days and officially sent the seven demands back to the head office yesterday. Yu Xianting, Xue Yinda, Zhang Guiqing, Wu Jucai, and Xia Yinxu were appointed to form a presidium, with Yu Xianting as the head of security, Zhang Guiqing as the head of the propaganda section, Ye Yufu and Wang Jielu as deputy heads, Xue Yinkui as the head of the investigation section, and Hu Maolin and Zhou Xinbao as deputy heads. The situation is serious and the work is intense, with a strong momentum to not rest until the goal is achieved.

<h3>National Seaport Quarantine Office Report on Cholera Prevention</h3>
<p>No. 7</p>
<p>The National Seaport Quarantine Office issued the seventh cholera prevention report: (1) During the week from August 30 to September 5, the cholera symptoms discovered in this city increased compared to before, but they were all mild and easily treated. According to the investigation report, 48 people were found in the Chinese area, all of whom have been cured. Eleven people were found in the Public Concession, one of whom has died. Eight people were found in the French Concession, all of whom have been cured. In total, there were 67 patients last week, and only one person died. (2) According to the investigation, about 25,000 people from Hankou have come to Shanghai to seek refuge, and one-third of them have no place to live and are temporarily living in temporary shelters. Recent reports in various newspapers have made many rumors about the shelters, but they are not true. The authorities have already taken preventive measures, so no cholera or other infectious diseases have been found in the shelters. Although cases of dysentery have been found, they are not new cases. Dysentery is a common disease in the Yangtze River basin and is not surprising. Director of the Health Bureau Hu Hongji and his police assistants are responsible for the medical affairs of the shelters. (3) The quarantine medical officers in Hankou, Nanjing, and Wusong have implemented inspections. The shipping companies for the civilian ships entering and leaving Shanghai and Hankou in each port are also assisting enthusiastically, which can reduce the import of infectious diseases to a minimum. (4) The first meeting of the Water Disaster Relief Committee was attended by 150 Chinese and foreign leaders, who announced that they had donated 2.5 million yuan for relief. One-seventh of the 7 million yuan relief fund is planned to be used for health work, which is very important. (5) Liu Ruiheng, director of the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the Relief Committee, has convened leaders from the Chinese and foreign medical communities to jointly discuss the direction of epidemic prevention work, in order to achieve practical results economically. (6) From April 1 to August 31 of this year, according to the latest statistics, the number of people who have received cholera vaccinations is as follows: Shanghai City 474,890 people, Public Concession 133,761 people, and French Concession 47,719 people. According to a detailed investigation report, none of those who have received vaccinations have contracted cholera or other infectious diseases.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Seawall in Danger</h3>
<p>The Baoshan seawall has not been repaired for three to five years. This year, after the hurricane high tide on August 25th of the lunar calendar, many dangerous situations have occurred. The engineering progress of the seawall office is slow, and the people of Baoshan are urgently appealing. According to the seawall inspection report on September 9th by Yuan Chushu, a member of the county's seawall protection committee: "On the morning of September 9th, we invited Committee Member Tao Qingfeng, Committee Member Jin Qiyuan, Representative Mr. Li Junbi, and Mr. Xiluo to depart from outside the north gate of Baoshan and inspect the seawall along the line. At 2 p.m., we arrived at the junction of Beichuan Sha and Taicang, about thirty miles away. Except for a section of four or five miles from Beishitang to Xiaosha Bei, which has a rising beach, and a section of about seven or eight miles from north of Huangyao to Xiaochuan Sha, which has a rising beach and is safe, the rest, from Chenhuabin to the north of Wuyuedun and the southern section of Huangyao, is about twenty miles long. Only a few sections newly built between 1919 and 1925 are still intact. In addition, dangers can occur everywhere. The construction of this seawall is divided into three parts. The outermost part is a breakwater built with cypress stone. The inner part is a stone embankment built with cypress stone, several feet wide, forming a slope. The innermost part is a regular embankment with cypress wood and stone on the outside and earth and mud filled on the inside, about three or four feet wide. Most of the cypress wood and stones in this twenty-mile long regular embankment have been washed away, leaving no trace, and half of the embankment's soil has also been washed away. The most dangerous sections are the three sections of the Gulongdun embankment, where there are now more than ten cracks across the embankment. These cracks are formed under the embankment, and only a small hole can be seen on the embankment surface. Looking down, the situation below can be seen, but it is not easily visible on the surface, which is the most dangerous. If these cracks are filled with water from the high tide, they can collapse immediately. North of the Lion Forest Fort, from Zhangjiazhai to Xuejiatan, there are more than ten places where only a foot or less of the soil embankment remains. The same is true for Niutoujing. As for the embankment around Beishidong, the water flow is rapid due to the tide entering and exiting the stone cave, and the construction of the embankment was previously stronger. However, a section of the embankment north of the cave, several tens of feet long, has been washed away and is in a dangerous situation. There is a section of about one hundred and several tens of feet at Wuyuedun, and its washed-away situation is similar to that of Xuejiatan. Seeing this situation, it is necessary to use tens of thousands of cypress trees, two to three hundred thousand burlap bags, and four to five thousand workers for emergency repairs in order to complete the dangerous work before the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month. If an accident occurs during the high tide period on the third day of the eighth lunar month, not only will all previous efforts be in vain, but it will also be impossible to protect. We asked the villagers along the seawall why the seawall was in such a dangerous state. They all replied that it had not been repaired once in the past four or five years since 1927. Therefore, there were already signs of danger last autumn. When we inspected the seawall, we saw about one hundred workers in Zhangjiazhai and Xuejiatan driving cypress trees and filling soil with burlap bags. However, at Wuyuedun, there were only twenty or thirty workers scattered around unloading and filling soil. The progress of the project was very slow. Moreover, we saw that there were not many cypress trees and burlap bags at Xuejiatan and Zhangjiazhai. When we returned to Bao in the evening, we saw few cypress trees and burlap bags piled up in front of the seawall office, which was not enough to use for emergency repairs. Moreover, the cypress trees were shorter and thinner than those used in the past. Therefore, the cypress trees driven in at Xuejiatan and Zhangzhai were about three or four feet lower than the old cypress trees that remained. I am afraid that piling up sandbags in this way will not be enough to resist the high tide. In addition, we did not see any workers working at the other dangerous places. When we returned at 5 p.m., we met Section Chief Xue at Lion Forest and asked about the number of workers currently working on emergency repairs. He said there were 200 people. We asked why the cypress trees were short and thin. He said that the price of wood was expensive, so he had no choice but to use this. We asked why the dangerous work that occurred last year was not repaired last year, leading to this year's great danger. He said that he had requested funding last year, but the requests were repeatedly denied. It was not as good as this year's Chairman Ye and Construction Director Sun, who were able to grant the requests. Xiluo and others saw this situation and felt extremely worried. According to the lunar calendar, there are two high tide periods in August, one lasting only four or five days and the other lasting only eighteen or nineteen days. If there is another hurricane with a high tide like the one on August 25th of the lunar calendar, how can we be spared? We must order the responsible persons to rush the work and speed up the repairs, and seek assistance from all parties to proceed. Therefore, we submit this report and request that an emergency meeting be convened quickly to discuss countermeasures for remedial action. This report is hereby made. Yuan Xiluo, Tao Qingfeng, Jin Qiyuan."</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide in Wusongkou, Huangpu River</h3>
<p>A Suicide Note Was Found Beside Him</p>
<p>At about 11:30 a.m. yesterday, a male corpse wearing a suit was found floating in the Huangpu River in front of the South Stone Fort at Wusongkou. The fortress headquarters notified the Wusong Lifesaving Bureau, which dispatched a lifesaving patrol boat to retrieve the corpse and take it to the beach. Gu Danchao, the director of the bureau, sent someone to investigate and found that the corpse was about 20 years old, with a round face, and his hair parted in two. He was wearing a purple flannel suit, gray flannel pants, a white linen shirt, blue sneakers, and black socks. There were no wounds on his body, and his face was not yet decomposed. A suicide note was found beside him, indicating that he had committed suicide by drowning. However, the name and address of the recipient written on the envelope were not very clear, so it was impossible to notify them. The charitable hall will temporarily collect and bury the body, marking the number for relatives to claim. There was also a note, a foreign thread coin purse containing two small foreign coins, eight copper coins, a rubber eraser, and a green pencil. The suicide note is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>The envelope is addressed to Mr. Liu ○ Liang, ○○ School, Fanhwangdu, Shanghai. Sent by Liu Ji, September 9. The letter reads: "Dear brother, it is unbearable to say goodbye forever. This morning, I received Mr. Yu's lecture, and my heart felt like it was pierced. After thinking again and again, if seeking knowledge is like this for young people, then what will the old do? I am truly a fool, and I have no face to see people. The harm to my foolish brother is especially painful. Dear brother, it is unbearable to say goodbye forever. I hope you will study hard and take care of yourself. The pillar of our family in the future depends on you. This is my deepest hope. I also hope that when my expenses are brought here, you will give 10.2 yuan to you, 20 yuan to Chen Lunxue, and 60 yuan to Bao Yi and Bao Shu, half each, and send the rest back to my father's house. Otherwise, you and the others can use it together, which is also fine. Dear brother, farewell forever. Please take care. Ya ○ said." Another note reads: "Dear brother Zishan, I sent a letter yesterday. I don't know if you have received it."</p>
<h3>The Strong-Arm Tactics of Four Detectives</h3>
<p>Dragging Pedestrians into Alleys</p>
<p>Extorting Money in Every Way Possible</p>
<p>The Police Department Prosecutes on Three Charges</p>
<p>Three Detectives Admit to Wrongdoing</p>
<p>Jiang Youming, residing in a bungalow on Connaught Road, was riding his bicycle home at 6:15 PM on the 1st of this month when he passed near the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road. He happened to encounter Guo Baolin, badge number 3217, Zhu Yigui, badge number 1637, Zhan Yande, badge number 2869, and Gong Ruilin, badge number 3086, all Chinese detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, who were searching pedestrians. Jiang was stopped and searched by Detective Guo. A lottery ticket was found in Jiang’s pocket. Detective Guo immediately dragged him into a nearby alley and demanded money for his release. They took the three silver dollars and two paper dollars that Jiang had in his pocket. Not satisfied, they forced Jiang to take off his pants and pawn them at the nearby Ruikang Pawnshop for two silver dollars, which Guo took before releasing Jiang. At 8:20 PM, Jiang reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese Detective Sergeants Bao Yongshun and Zhang Wenjun arrested the four detectives and had Jiang identify them among a group of other detectives. Jiang immediately pointed out Detective Guo. The sergeants detained Guo, Zhu, Zhan, and Gong. Three silver dollars were found on Guo, and Jiang identified one of them as his own, recognizing a black mark on the coin's surface. Due to the late hour, the police station could not investigate thoroughly that night, so they applied to the court for temporary detention the next day. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court, charging the four detectives with robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Law, abuse of official duty under Article 140, and dereliction of duty under Article 129, requesting severe punishment. At 9 AM, Magistrate Wu Tingqi opened the court to question the suspects. Jiang Youming testified about the events, stating that the paper found by Detective Guo was a note from his uncle asking him to pick up a raincoat on Sima Road, not a lottery ticket. Sergeants Bao and Zhang testified about the investigation and Jiang's identification of Detective Guo at the police station. At this point, Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Guo, Zhu, and Zhan had all written confessions at the police station, while Gong denied the charges. The confessions were presented to the court. When questioned, Detective Guo admitted to the incident and claimed that they had also discovered someone carrying opium. After negotiating with Inspector Connor, Western detective number 321, for 50 dollars, the Western detective ordered their release. The four of them then split the money, receiving seven and a half dollars each. When questioned, Zhu Yigui, Zhan Yande, and Gong Ruilin all admitted to releasing the opium carrier but denied involvement in the Jiang Youming case. They stated that they were under the control of the Western detective, and they had to release the suspect if he ordered them to do so. Magistrate Wu Tingqi reviewed the testimonies and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>
<h3>### Conviction for Fundraising Scam</h3>
<p>Guo Biao Reports on the Deceptive Donation Process</p>
<p>Zheng Youqing Sentenced to Five Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zheng Youqing (also known as Bo Xun), the son of Zheng A Yuan, the owner of the Juchang Pawnshop at 112 Wusong Road, neglected his duties, left his family, and wandered aimlessly for several years. Last month, he suddenly arrived in Shanghai from Hankou with a young woman named Tang Jinghua and others, staying in Room 123 of the Dadong Hotel. Using the false name of the "Guangdong Overseas Chinese Hankou Disaster Relief Group," he, along with Lin Shanbo and a woman named Zheng Wangshi, went out to solicit donations. They also placed advertisements to recruit contact staff. Someone discovered their fraudulent scheme and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Wang Yingjie arrested Zheng and the other three individuals, confiscating counterfeit donation books, receipts, seals, and collected donations. They were taken to the First Special District Court, which ordered them each to post a 1,000-dollar bail and conducted an investigation. The previous report detailed the situation. It is now known that only Zheng Wangshi was bailed out that day, while the others remained in custody. Detective Wang continued his investigation and discovered that Zheng Wangshi owned the Runchang Clothing Store at 122 Wusong Road, and her husband was a relative of Zheng Youqing. Lin Shanbo, whose original name was Huang Binghua, was a surveyor of damaged goods on the Blue Funnel Line at the Taikoo Wharf. Both were recruited by Zheng Youqing after arriving in Shanghai to join the fundraising group. The 41 dollars in donations they had collected were also investigated. The detective visited the names listed in the donation book, such as dentist Wang Bingji at 50 Beijing Road, dentist Li Xinquan at 685 North Sichuan Road, and Zheng Huili, all of whom confirmed they had been defrauded. During the previous court hearing, Zheng Youqing claimed that he had raised 6,000 dollars from the Guang Zhao Public Association and that the association had sent Cheng Bingkui with him to Hankou to distribute the relief funds. However, Zheng had stayed in Shanghai due to other business, and Cheng had gone alone. After this was reported in the newspapers, the association stated that it was far from the truth. Therefore, when Magistrate Cheng Shangfeng continued the trial yesterday morning, Guo Biao, a director of the association, testified in court. Guo stated that on the 27th of last month, Zheng Youqing suddenly reported to the association, claiming to be a representative of the Hankou Guangdong Overseas Chinese Hankou Disaster Relief Group, and requested donations. At that time, the entire board was discussing the Wuhan flood relief efforts. They allowed him to participate, as he had just come from the disaster area and was familiar with the situation. He then presented a letter stating the disaster situation in detail and requested the association to publish an advertisement recognizing his fundraising group as the official relief organization for Guangdong overseas Chinese in Hankou. The directors, suspecting his motives, refused his request. The meeting resulted in a donation of 6,000 dollars, and Cheng Bingkui was sent to Hankou to distribute the funds, which were to be collected at the Wing On Company branch in Hankou. Zheng Youqing was not sent with him. After seeing the report in the newspapers, the association sent a letter to Cheng to investigate. They received a telegram in response stating that there was no such organization in Hankou. The address they provided was also investigated, and there were no residents with the names of the defendants. The only official Guangdong organization in Hankou was the Overseas Chinese Commerce Association, which was responsible for all relief efforts. Representatives from those who had been defrauded, such as Wang Bingji, also appeared in court to testify about the fraudulent donation scheme and the amount of their losses. When questioned, Zheng Youqing claimed that he had witnessed the severe flood and organized a fundraising group with ten comrades. He and Tang Jinghua, Lin Xiao Bai, and Chen Sanhong were sent to Shanghai to raise funds. He and Tang remained in Shanghai to solicit donations, while Lin and Chen went to Southeast Asia. Lin Xiao Bai and Zheng Wangshi both testified that Zheng had recruited them to help. Tang's testimony matched Zheng's. Police Lawyer Qian Xunji stated that Tang and Zheng appeared to be in a marital relationship but were not married. After arguments from defendant lawyers Huang Yupi and Huang Xiubo, Magistrate Cheng declared that the defendants were guilty of joint fraud. Zheng was sentenced to five months imprisonment, Tang to three months imprisonment, and Lin and Zheng Wangshi were each fined 400 dollars. The donation books were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Fundraising Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>Bearing the Seal of the West Shanghai Charity Group</p>
<p>Investigation by the Urgent Relief Association's Propaganda Team</p>
<p>The Shanghai Urgent Relief Association's Propaganda Team for the provinces affected by flooding noticed someone distributing donation letters with the seal of the West Shanghai Charity Group in the Xinzha Road area, soliciting donations door-to-door in an attempt to collect money. They immediately sent representatives to the West Shanghai Charity Group in Tangjiawan to investigate. The group's communications director received them and, when asked whether the group had sent anyone out to solicit donations, stated that they were unaware. When shown the original donation letter and its seal, which appeared similar to the group's seal, they agreed to inquire and respond the following day. The investigators asked for the minutes of any fundraising discussions and requested to see the seal for verification. They were told that the group had not held any meetings to discuss sending letters for donations. The seal was in the custody of the documents clerk and could not be obtained for comparison. The matter might be the action of an individual member, which was unknown. When asked about the group's leaders, they were told that the director was Liang Yegong. Accompanied by Wang, they went to inquire with Xu in detail. Xu stated that the group had absolutely not taken such action and that someone must be using their name under false pretenses. He agreed to investigate the matter within the group.</p>
<h3>Another Red and Green Traffic Light Activated</h3>

<h3>Paul Discusses the Utility of Automobiles</h3>
<p>Remarks at a Rotary Club Luncheon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club held a luncheon at the Navy YMCA on Sichuan Road the day before yesterday and invited Paul, from the American Automobile Trade Association, to speak on the importance of automobile transportation. He stated that not long ago, the United States had only four automobiles, one of which was used as a promotional tool in a circus. Today, there are 26 million automobiles, more than telephones. It would be easy for everyone in the country to travel by automobile, with one car for every five people. They could set off at the same time and travel to remote towns. Long-distance buses now run regularly between cities as far apart as New York and San Francisco, and they are as fast as trains. Automobile garages in large cities are located in 22-story buildings, with elevators for raising and lowering cars. Specially built automobile tunnels cross rivers and streams to supplement bridges. Even in crowded cities like New York, elevated highways are being planned for fast automobile traffic. The reason automobiles have developed so much in America is that people have adopted a new concept, recognizing the importance of time. They understand that a large part of our lives is spent on travel (i.e., the "travel" in the necessities of life: clothing, food, housing, and travel). By saving time on travel, more time can be devoted to other endeavors. People want to do things with the least cost and the greatest efficiency. "Cost" refers not only to money but also to labor and time. Therefore, in terms of transportation, rickshaws are the most expensive because, although the fare is cheap, the cost of the journey is high when the distance traveled and the time spent are combined. The German automobile manufacturing industry a few years ago provides an example. At that time, German wages were low, only one-sixth of American wages, but American-made automobiles could compete with German automobiles in the market because the United States used machines to manufacture automobiles ten times faster, reducing costs. To utilize automobiles for transportation, good roads are essential. Road construction is the primary task in developing automobile transportation. Fortunately, automobiles are productive, and with good policies, the cost of road construction can be easily offset. For example, after automobiles are introduced, poor people can travel to more distant locations to purchase cheaper goods. The increased tax burden from road construction can be offset in this way. Road construction can be financed by issuing bonds, with tax revenue used as collateral for repaying the principal and interest. Today, China is gradually adopting the concept of time, and road construction is underway. Passengers and goods are increasingly transported by automobiles. As transportation becomes more convenient, the waste of time will gradually decrease.</p>
<h3>Urging Payment of Overdue 1927 Land Tax</h3>
<p>During the 1927 year when the city and county were not yet separated, there were still significant overdue land taxes. Although the County Finance Bureau has repeatedly issued strict orders to collect these taxes, they have not yet been fully recovered. It has been found that most of these overdue taxes were misappropriated by local security chiefs and others. The County Finance Bureau's authority does not extend to those who misappropriated the funds, as they are now under the jurisdiction of the city. Director Wang of the Bureau has instructed the original officials responsible for collecting the taxes to press for payment, and ordered a separate investigation of those who misappropriated the funds, to be reported for prosecution to ensure national revenue.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Collides with Tram</h3>
<p>Tram number 188, running between Jing'an Temple and Bazichang, was traveling east on Nanjing Road at 3:05 PM yesterday when it approached the western end of the baseball field. A public bus, number 15086, was traveling in the same direction when the driver carelessly collided with the entrance gate of the tram. The loud crash startled the passengers. Fortunately, the brakes were applied quickly, preventing a major disaster and no one was injured. However, the tram's iron gate and the front of the bus were slightly damaged.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Debt Case Results in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Wu Songyan and Wei Zitang Held Responsible</p>
<p>Owed Debt of 110,000 Taels Must Be Repaid</p>
<p>Wu Songyan and Wei Zitang, silk factory shareholders from Wuxing, formerly representing various silk factories, borrowed 260,000 taels of silver, including interest, a total of 275,000 taels from Amidani, an Italian at the Bao Ke Foreign Firm. The loan was distributed as follows: 40,000 taels to the Dalun Silk Factory, 20,000 taels to the Yongfeng Silk Factory, and the remainder to the Jiulun Silk Factory. Later, Jiulun repaid 90,000 taels, but the remaining amount was not repaid. Amidani subsequently died. Recently, Amidani's representative, Fumagali, hired lawyer Yan Huilian and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the Jiulun Silk Factory, identifying Wu and Wei as the owners of Jiulun, demanding repayment of 110,000 taels and associated legal costs. Wu and Wei hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to defend themselves, denying that they were the owners of the Jiulun Silk Factory. They claimed that Jiulun was a partnership with eight shareholders, including Chen Shuying, Chen Jingxian, Huang Xinsheng, Xu Shaobo, Zhu Jiling, and Cao Zipei in addition to Wu and Wei. They also claimed that the debt was owed by Jiulun, and all shareholders should be responsible for their share, not just Wu and Wei. Therefore, they requested that Chen Shuying and the others also be included as defendants. The Special Court had already held one hearing in the case, which was then adjourned. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Li Mo announced the verdict in the Ninth Civil Court, ruling against Wu and the others and ordering them to repay the outstanding 110,000 taels.</p>
<h3>Yongfa Sandboat Robbed by Pirates</h3>
<p>Six Abducted... Crew Injured... Cargo Robbed</p>
<p>The Gong Yongfa sandboat, owned by the Yongli Company, recently loaded timber in Fuzhou, worth over 60,000 taels of silver, for delivery to Yangzhou. Because the Shanghai office still had goods to be transported to the company's boat in Yangzhou, it arrived in Wusong on the 3rd of this month and anchored. Due to the large amount of cargo, it could not be loaded at once, so it set sail to Yangzhou to unload before returning to Shanghai to load more. On the afternoon of the 6th, while sailing off the coast of Haimen, it was suddenly attacked by a large group of pirates in three ships, sailing quickly with the wind. The pirates surrounded the sandboat. The crew of the sandboat, realizing the danger, ordered the sails to be raised and tried to escape. The pirates saw this and fired over ten shots at the sandboat, damaging the hull and injuring three crew members. The crew tried their best to escape the pirates but were pursued. Eventually, the smaller, faster pirate ships caught up with the sandboat, and the pirates, armed with guns and swords, swarmed aboard. Two pirates slipped and fell into the sea as they boarded the ship, enraging the others. They attacked the crew indiscriminately, injuring many more. They searched the captain's cabin, looting all the silver, ledgers, and a suitcase. They searched the crew and left no one unrobbed. One helmsman resisted and was shot and killed. Before leaving, they kidnapped the captain, Peng Guangyi, and two crew members, placing them on three separate pirate ships. They told the remaining crew to prepare 6,000 dollars for their ransom before sailing northeast. After the pirates left, the sandboat sailed to Liuhe, purchased a coffin for the slain helmsman, and sent the injured to the hospital. Yesterday, the Yongli Company received the report and sent representatives to Liuhe to investigate the robbery and report it to the water police for investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Yang Linxiang Case Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Yang Linxiang, a resident of Ayi Bridge, Meilong, Caohejing, was found dead, and the local court sent investigators. The deceased's wife, Yang Anan, claimed that her husband was scolded by Bai Yunzhang, her adoptive father, leading to his suicide by hanging. However, locals and officers from the Third Precinct of the Sixth District claimed that Yang Anan was promiscuous and the deceased did not have a steady job. The two did not get along, so she killed him by placing a bamboo dustpan over his neck and strangling him, rather than him committing suicide. Therefore, the court ordered the arrest and detention of Yang Anan. However, Xia Fuzhi, the deceased's brother, and Xie, the deceased's mother, have not filed a case or requested a re-examination of the body. The court has summoned those involved for questioning to determine the facts of the case.</p>
<h3>Identity of Unidentified Male Corpse</h3>
<p>Name Card Reads "Cheng Xianggui, Hao Xiangqiu"</p>
<p>Yesterday, an unidentified male corpse was discovered floating on the water near Lujiazui Wharf. The deceased appeared to be around 30 years old, wearing a striped linen suit, a white shirt, a white undershirt, a red and black floral tie, a leather belt, white socks, and black leather shoes. He had a flat-top haircut. The corpse was floating up and down with the current. A patrol boat from the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Rescue Bureau in the Nanshi district spotted the body, retrieved it, and brought it to the bureau in front of the South Wharf. Multiple name cards were found near the body, bearing the name "Cheng Xianggui, Hao Xiangqiu." However, the address and origin were not indicated.

<p>Readers' Letters</p>
<p>From Fangcao Shanren:</p>
<p>My father passed away early, and my mother was very strict. At the age of fourteen, I abandoned Chinese and English studies to learn the business of finance. I went from being an apprentice to managing money, from the silver room to the accounting room, from the accounting room to the street, and from the street to management (i.e., manager). Unexpectedly, in the first year of the Republic, the Wuchang Uprising occurred, and the store closed down, leaving me unemployed. Urged by my mother again, I entered the Hubei China Banking School, graduating after three years. Afterward, I spent more than ten years on the financial street in Hankou, but I could not find a way into the banking industry itself. This shows that studying is useless. Moreover, bank employees in Hankou are purely recommended by influential figures and have a shareholder nature, not those with academic research experience. Therefore, I gave up. Then, the split between Nanjing and Wuhan occurred, cash was frozen, and the store closed again, making me a second-time unemployed person. I returned to Huangshigang to engage in real estate or transportation business. Although the boat business has not succeeded, the real estate has indeed flourished. I built twenty-six buildings of civilian housing in Xuchunli, Huangshigang. Unexpectedly, I encountered an unprecedented and unmatched flood, all of which were washed away by the flood, leaving only stone, wood, and land. It is a sigh! This is my third unemployment recently. The pain I have suffered is unbearable. Fortunately, the water in the Yangtze River basin rises and falls with the autumn. The flood will recede soon. Moreover, Hankou is a famous commercial center in our country. The government will surely solve it with scientific methods in the future, so I will not discuss it for now. However, there are as many collapsed houses as in rural towns. Unfortunately, Hankou has no property companies, and it may be difficult to recover in the shortest period. Therefore, I borrow your newspaper to (1) introduce banking jobs, (2) have property companies in Shanghai set up branches in Hankou and I am willing to be a guide, (3) Shanghai people cooperate with Xuchun Property Joint Venture in Huangshigang, which is also very welcome. Our port is the location of various mines and forests in Daye, which is not only profitable but also very stable, and leaves a reputation for future generations. (4) Since abandoning the financial business four years ago, I have been engaged in the property industry and have quite a lot of knowledge about various projects. In the future, Hankou will need to scout engineering talents first. If there are large construction companies or factory construction companies in Shanghai, they can also provide preliminary effects. In short, I ask your newspaper to introduce the corresponding living conditions in the above four cities. Moreover, I have been reading your newspaper for thirty years and consider myself a loyal reader.</p>
<p>(Reply) Since you have specialized research, rich experience, and management skills, it is expected that you will get a chance shortly. We are answering publicly on the newspaper, as an aid to finding friends.</p>
<p>From Ms. Mou:</p>
<p>I am a female student who has just graduated from a famous university. For the sake of career issues, I have been running around for several days, but I only got anxiety and unemployment. Now I see the reply to Mr. Ye (the way out for college students) in the newspaper, which caused this letter. As you said, most of the college graduates nowadays study practical subjects very few, so that what they have studied is not what they can use, and they cannot cope with the needs of society. What I study is politics and economics, so there are many places where I am not suitable. But I am not disappointed because of this. I really want to find a reluctant way to find a way for myself, engage in writing and submitting articles, or translating books, but translating books is very difficult. As for writing articles, there are also many difficulties. Because one person's learning ability is limited, at this time of living alone in a foreign land, it is impossible to unite several comrades. After all, this layer must rely on one's own strength to do it. This is the first difficulty. I am a person who has rarely been in contact with society on weekdays and has no experience. I don't know what kind of articles to write and where to submit articles. This is the second difficulty. In terms of books, in addition to personal purchases, because the library is very far away, it is inconvenient to go back and forth, and it is not economical, so I can't get good books. This is the third difficulty. Other, what is called (short-term study of subjects that are more needed by society)? What kind of subjects are more needed and can be studied in a short period of time? Please tell me the details of the above items, so as to avoid difficulties. I also hope to continue to ask for advice in the future, it is very fortunate.</p>
<p>(Reply) We think that the three difficulties you mentioned are true. In the middle, you mentioned the article submission section, in addition to the whole book, various daily newspapers and famous weekly and monthly magazines all have the opportunity to contribute. You only need to try what you can do and like to do. However, the way of writing articles is all based on the usual specialized academic research and the observation of social conditions. You must accumulate deeply and richly, and then use appropriate art to develop it, so that it is a valuable work. If you write for the sake of writing, it is meaningless. Do you think this is right? Reading your letter, the writing is tactful, and the thinking is thorough. I believe that you have the ability to express your thoughts. I hope you will fight patiently and don't be discouraged. As for the short-term study of subjects, the Chinese Vocational Education Society attached to the Huanlong Road has several subjects. You may want to ask about it.</p>
<p>From Mr. Lin Dingxi:</p>
<p>I am from Sanshui, Guangdong. I graduated from the high school department of St. John's University this summer. I am eighteen years old this year and I am determined to study fishery in order to prepare for the improvement and development of China's fishery industry. But I am suffering from the fact that there is no such school in China to study. Please tell me the fishery schools and their contents at home and abroad, so as to solve my problems of enrollment and future employment.</p>
<p>(Reply) There are schools in China related to fishery. The names and contents of the schools I have investigated are listed below for your reference.</p>

<h3>Continued News of the Shenhu Steamer Damaging the Embankment</h3>
<p>Yongan Steamer of the Yongan Bureau</p>
<p>The Shenjiao Steamer Has Also Suspended Service</p>
<p>The Yongan steamer within the Shenhu class, was detained by the Zhejiang Provincial Government because it damaged the Huzhou embankment, and fined 1.2 million yuan, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now I learned that the detained Yongan steamer belongs to the Yongan Steamer Bureau, not the Yongshun Company. After this incident, there was no solution for a while. Now I learned that the Huzhou County Government, in order to prevent further damage to the embankment, has set up watermarks to limit the size. If the inland steamers do not comply with the limited watermarks and run without authorization, in addition to immediately detaining the ships, they will be fined 600,000 yuan. After the promulgation of this serious ban, the Shanghai Steamer Bureaus have suspended the Huzhou class, and dare not violate this ban again.</p>
<p>The Shenjiao Steamer of the China Merchants Bureau has recently stopped sailing because the river water in the Zhujiajiao area has risen sharply and the county office has prohibited sailing.</p>

<h3>Ciyou Association Prevents Trafficking of Children</h3>
<p>Strict Investigation at the Wharf and Railway Station</p>
<p>The flood this time has caused widespread disasters. The victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, came to Shanghai to take refuge, numbering in the thousands. Ignorant and profit-seeking traitors took the opportunity to buy the children of refugees and sell them as slaves, concubines, and prostitutes, which was also slightly heard. The Chinese Ciyou Association, with the purpose of protecting children's rights and seeking children's happiness, is deeply afraid that innocent disaster children will be abducted, deceived, and sold, falling into the endless hell. It has widely publicized it so that sympathetic people can report information for investigation. It is also strictly visiting at the wharf and railway station. If there are suspicious persons, they will be strictly interrogated. If there is evidence, they will be sent to the court for legal action. It is heard that the Association has now received reports and, together with detectives, has uncovered several cases of abductors and sent them to the court for thorough investigation. It is hoped that sympathetic people, if they encounter child trafficking, will go to the Chinese Ciyou Association at No. 20 Shanghai Museum Road to report. The Association will be able to thoroughly investigate. If necessary, it can also keep the reporter's information confidential. I will list it in detail. I hope sympathetic people will save the weak compatriots together.</p>
<h3>New Autumn Dysentery Epidemic</h3>

<p>Letter from:</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have just read the news column of this port in the 11th month of this month in your newspaper, which contains the negotiation between the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Yongshun Steamer Bureau. Ge Sheng was horrified. It is found that there are two early steamer companies operating on the Shenhu route in Shanghai, Yongan Steamer Bureau and our company (ie, Yongshun Steamer Company). Our company's steamer (ie, Yongxin) has been suspended due to the flood, in compliance with the order of the official office, and has been suspended for two months. It has not been resumed yet. The fact that the embankment was damaged by the running this time is Yongan Steamer, which is owned by Yongan Steamer, not Yongxin Steamer of our company. The words Yongshun Steamer Bureau, etc. in the newspaper are rumors and untrue. If it is not corrected, I am afraid that it will confuse the hearing. Therefore, I respectfully send you a letter and hope that you will check it and publish it in the letter column to correct it and show the truth. I wish you all the best. Yongshun Steamer Co., Ltd. September 11.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, On the 11th of this month, I read in the news column of your newspaper that the tea servant Tang Jinsheng of this home testified that the gangster Li Jisan, etc., were in Room 1. After investigation, there is no such person as Tang Jinsheng in the tea service of this home. The so-called Li Jisan has never been here. The room numbers of this home have always started from No. 31, and there is no Room 1. I believe it is a rumor. It is about the reputation of this home and should be corrected by letter. Dongsheng Xinji Qi, September 12.</p>

<h3>The Commander-in-Chief of Five Cents</h3>
<p>There are twenty-seven libraries in Tokyo, Japan. There are two large ones: one is the Tokyo Ueno Imperial Library; the other is the Tokyo Imperial University Library. The Ueno Library has 670,000 volumes. The Tokyo University Library has 600,000 volumes. Compared with the National Library of Paris with 5 million volumes, the British Museum Library of London with 5 million volumes, and the US Congressional Library in Washington with 4.4 million volumes, these two libraries are still a little less impressive, but in the culturally poor Orient, they can really be regarded as the best for a while. The Tokyo University Library was built with donations from the Rockefeller Foundation, founded by the American oil king, at a cost of 5.5 million Japanese yen, equivalent to 11 million Chinese yuan. The Rockefeller Foundation donated 4 million Japanese yen, and the remaining 1.5 million Japanese yen was paid by the national treasury. This library does not allow non-students to read. I got a letter of introduction from Ran Ansen of the Rockefeller Foundation, so I can find a way to go in to read, but because I was in a hurry to return to China, I did not get full use of it. The Ueno Library is open to the public, and anyone can go in to read for only five cents. The average number of readers per day is 1,200. If there are specialized questions, you can spend five cents to buy a research ticket to enter the research room to read. In this way, not only can you access the 670,000 volumes of books in the library, but the books outside the library can also be borrowed for you. This method can be regarded as extremely convenient for academic research. I told a friend this, and he said to me: (You spent five cents to become the commander-in-chief of this million-volume book, which is something to be proud of.)</p>
<h3>The Weight of the Brain</h3>
<p>— Hu Xingbo</p>
<p>The brain is the center of the nervous system. It controls all of our activities. For example, the movements of the five senses and hundreds of bones are all driven by the brain. According to physiological research, the more intelligent a person is, the heavier his brain is, and the more wrinkles on its surface. People cannot measure the weight of the brain and calculate the wrinkles of a living person, but only dissect and measure the dead.</p>
<p>According to research, the weight of a man's brain is greatest between the ages of fifty and sixty. The opposite is true for women. It is heaviest between the ages of twenty and thirty. Also, a man's brain is heavier than a woman's brain. The above survey is true in all countries of the world.</p>
<p>The brain weights of people of various races in the world are compared as follows.</p>
<p>European race male 1367 watts female 1206 watts. Malay Peninsula race male 1319 watts female 129 watts. American race (Indian) male 1308 watts female 1187 watts. Asian race male 2304 watts female 1194 watts. African race male 1293 watts female 1211 watts. Australian race male 1214 watts female 1111 watts.</p>
<p>The above is the average calculation of each race. Now, the weights of the brains of the great men of various countries are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The brain of the great revolutionary Mr. Sun in our country. Its weight is very abnormal. According to the dissector, Mr. Sun's brain is actually one watt heavier than Lenin's in Russia. The weight of Mr. Sun's brain is 1505 watts, while Lenin's is 1504 watts.</p>
<p>The heaviest brain of the great men in the world. For the famous Russian writer Turgenev. Its weight is 2012 watts. The famous Prime Minister of Japan (end of the Meiji era) Taro Katsura was 1600 watts. The Japanese writer Natsume Soseki was 1425 watts. The European musical saint Chopin was more than 1420 watts. The above are recorded only after dissection after death. It is unknown whether there are those who have not been dissected or exceed the above records.</p>
<p>From the above, the superiority or inferiority of the human race seems to be innate rather than acquired. But that's not true. The weight of the brain is purely a matter of whether it is used or not. All things develop when used and degenerate when not used. Therefore, the weight of the brain and the number of wrinkles are purely a matter of the degree of use.</p>
<h3>World Small Chronicle</h3>
<p>An Educated Fish: At a certain university in Berlin, Germany, Professor De-Jing has attempted to teach fish how to read. The method used is to put their favorite food in bags marked with letters.</p>
<p>For example, the best food is marked with the letter A, and the second-best with the letter B. When the two bags are placed together, after some training, the fish will naturally find the A bag to eat. This shows that they have recognized the two letters A and B.</p>
<p>▲ The Inventor of the Tank: The most famous and effective weapon in killing the enemy during the European War, aside from poison gas, is the tank. It is said that it was initially proposed by a British officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.D. Swinton, to the War Department of his country to rush the construction. After its creation, it was put into operation on the front lines. That was in October of 1914, and it achieved great results. However, recently, a certain German inventor claimed that he had drawn a tank design in 1913 and displayed it in Berlin. Therefore, the right to invention should belong to him. (Hai Ke)</p>

<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The end of the seventh month of the abolished lunar calendar is commonly referred to as the Ksitigarbha Festival, which is also known as the birthday of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva by Buddhists. Although the old calendar has been abolished, its profound influence on people's hearts over thousands of years cannot be eradicated immediately. It is traditionally believed that the seventh month is the Ghost Month, and families of modest means invariably hire monks to hold the Ullambana Festival to deliver the wandering souls. The wealthy families do even more.</p>
<p>According to folklore, Ksitigarbha's birthday falls on the 30th day of the intercalary seventh month. It is not the correct day if it is not an intercalary month or a short month. This saying is quite interesting. According to Buddhists, on this night, the Lord Ksitigarbha personally descends to hell to inquire about sufferings. At this time, the wronged souls are all delivered, and the gates of Fengdu City are opened to let them wander freely. Therefore, the Ullambana Festival is held to allow the wandering souls at the bottom of hell to enjoy the nectar and escape their sins. Although this matter belongs to superstition, the purpose of religion is mostly like this.</p>
<p>In the Suzhou area, on the day of the Ksitigarbha Festival, every household burns incense and candles at night, inserting them in the courtyard or placing them in front of the door. Wealthy families arrange them like stars, which is quite pleasing to the eye. This is called "Longing Incense." The initial purpose of this practice was to commemorate Zhang Shicheng of the early Ming Dynasty, so it was named "Longing." At that time, Shicheng defended Suzhou and was very popular with the people. The city was breached on the 30th day of the seventh month, and Shicheng died. The people of Suzhou mourned him, and thus the custom of "Longing Incense" arose, but they dared not speak of it openly. They only feigned lighting incense and candles to illuminate the path to the underworld. It is said that on this day, Fengdu opens its gates, and the wandering souls roam everywhere. Over time, the story was distorted, and the true meaning of the two characters "Longing" was gradually lost. People genuinely believe that it is held due to the Ksitigarbha Festival.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, the Ullambana Festival on the day of the Ksitigarbha Festival was extremely lively, competing with events like the Three Kings Festival and the Zhou King Festival, or even surpassing them. In addition to the necessary programs such as stilt walking, platform performances, and tea box dances, there were also paper effigies of ghosts, such as Black and White Impermanence, Big Head and Small Head, Judges, Ox-Head and Horse-Face, etc., everything that one could imagine. When it was held, the streets were deserted, and its grandeur was unparalleled. Today, most of this has disappeared. Occasionally, one can see only a few gongs and drums and a few ghost effigies, and there is no interest to speak of. This kind of prototype of the Ullambana Festival can only be seen in Shanghai; in the inland, it has been suspended as a superstitious prohibition.</p>
<p>In Suzhou, on the night of the Ksitigarbha Festival, in addition to "Longing Incense," paper ingots are also burned outside the door. Later, every household did this, and beggars greatly benefited from it. Holding brooms and dustpans, they went from house to house sweeping up the ash and selling it to merchants. More than ten years ago, each person could get more than ten catties. Now, it is only a few catties. Therefore, beggars are overjoyed on the day of the Ksitigarbha Festival because they have unexpected income.</p>
<h3>A Record of Bee's Help in Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>There are many painting societies in Shanghai, but the Bee Painting Society, organized by famous painters Zheng Wuchang, Li Zuhan, Sun Xueni, Qian Shoutie, and others, has more than two hundred members, occupying a significant portion of the art world. Among the most famous members of the society are Xie Gongzhan, Zhang Shanzi, Ma Qizhou, He Tianjian, Xiong Songquan, Wang Shizi, Ye Weishen, Ma Wanli, Xie Zhiguang, Hu Ruosi, Ma Mengrong, and others, more than twenty in total. However, since Zheng Wuchang joined the army, the Bee Pictorial has also been discontinued. The society's affairs have been suspended in an invisible way. Last month, Zheng returned from the Eighth Army on leave, and Qian Shoutie also returned from Japan. The Bee Society held a banquet at Tao Le Chun to welcome Zheng and Qian and to discuss collecting paintings for disaster relief. At the table, Qian raised his glass to thank his colleagues and immediately proposed various methods for collecting paintings. Sun and Qian planned to underwrite the costs of opening a hotel and invite colleagues to cooperate for ten days. Zhu Rongzhuang believed that it would be a waste of money and that there might not be good works, so he asked everyone to sign up and commit to a certain number of paintings. Everyone agreed. On the spot, Xie Gongzhan, He Tianjian, Wang Shizi, Ma Mengrong, Qian Shoutie, Sun Xueni, Ye Weishen, Hu Ruosi, and others signed up for twenty paintings each. Ma Qizhou, Xiong Songquan, Zheng Wuchang, Zhu Rongzhuang, Gong Tiemei, Zhang Shanzi, and others signed up for ten paintings each. Li Zuhan, Shen Zicheng, and Xie Zhiguang signed up for five paintings each. Gu Ji signed up for ten paintings. All paintings were to be submitted within fifteen days. If there was spare time, they would collaborate at Chongfa Temple every evening to make up for any shortcomings. The motion was passed unanimously. By the time the banquet ended, the bell had already rung nine times.</p>
<p>▲ Publishing News: The Shanghai Pictorial in this city has been reorganized and has added several famous reporters to write and special photographers. It has been completely renovated. The new issue was published on the 9th, exquisitely printed on milky white copperplate paper. From the 15th, a roll of paper will be added for separate sale. Copperplate paper is exclusively for subscribers. It is said that those who subscribe for the whole year will receive a five-yuan book coupon as a gift. The roll of paper is two yuan per year and also comes with a two-yuan book coupon.</p>
<p>▲ To Gentlemen Who Wish to Purchase Baiyao: Lu Danjun brought back from Yunnan Baibao Dan (i.e., Baiyao). It is now sold by the Tiannan Company, located at No. 9 Park Road, British Concession, Shanghai (next to the Gongdelin Vegetable Restaurant behind the Carlton Theatre). Gentlemen who wish to purchase it, please purchase it directly from the company.</p>
<h3>Records of Things Seen and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Tuancheng (Round City)</p>
<p>In previous years, when the emperor was in Xiyuan (West Garden), foreign envoys were required to have an audience at Chengguang Hall. The hall was built on top of Tuancheng. One would ascend through the side gate, level platform several acres in size, densely paved with patterned bricks. The hall was tall and imposing, with open windows and railings. Nearby, one could appreciate the waves of the North Sea; in the distance, the blue and green hues of the Western Hills floated. The exquisite palaces were truly the unique beauty of our country's architecture. According to its system, it has always existed in ancient times. Therefore, what is called "a platform to the right of the palace for emergencies" in ancient books. In modern times, the construction of platforms is rare. It must be that the Mongol Yuan did not master this skill. The scale of the palaces in Beijing all follows the old Yuan system. The emperors of the Ming Dynasty often held audiences on the platform. In the Qing Palace, only Tuancheng can be called a platform. If Yingtai is, it is not really a platform. I often worked here during the years of the Republic of China 12 and 13, enjoying its beautiful scenery morning and evening. I especially loved the ancient junipers in the courtyard. The junipers are characterized by white scales and bright green, with gnarled trunks and sparse shade. The leaves are similar to pine but slightly finer. Their posture is not as strange and outstanding as pine, but their elegance far surpasses it. Among them, the largest one is said to be a relic from the Jin Dynasty. More than ten younger ones are arranged next to it. Over the years, this place has been used as a public office. The ignorant servants used smoke and fire to fumigate it, and many have died, which is a pity. I once stroked and drew this tree and attached a poem to it, saying: "Eight hundred springs have passed before my eyes, and the palace trees on the precious platform are still jagged. How can the Jin Dynasty remember the peaceful times? The jade urn remains from after the calamity. It's useless to leave Qingyin to vulgar guests; if the waters of the return pool could wash away the dust. It should still regret growing old in the human world, not being used as firewood with the coiling dragon pillars." The jade urn in the poem refers to the wine urn made by Kublai Khan. During the Yuan Dynasty, it was always placed in the main hall during grand court assemblies. Later, it fell into the Zhenwu Temple outside Xihua Gate, and people called it the Jade Bowl Nunnery. In the tenth year of Qianlong, it was purchased for a thousand gold coins, moved to the courtyard of the hall, and covered with a stone pavilion, engraved with imperial poems and poems by various officials. The urn is made of black jade. According to its natural form, it is slightly carved. It can hold several stones of wine. This is truly a rare treasure of historical significance. As for the white jade Buddha enshrined in the hall, inlaid with precious stone璎珞, which ordinary people often admire endlessly, it is not enough to compare with this. People in the north do not know the two characters "juniper" and "cypress" and call it "white-bark pine." Looking at it for years, it seems to be covered with frost and snow. It can also be seen in suburban trips, and people in the south are often surprised by it as a wonder.</p>

<h3>A Husband's Wife (11)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"You want to marry a thrifty and home-managing wife, why don't you marry Lanzhen! I married you for my husband to provide me with living expenses. Everything I use is necessary living expenses, and you feel the pain even for these. You might as well kill me, or divorce me, and I won't ask you for money anymore. If you have the ability, do it quickly! Otherwise, I am not Lanzhen. I won't cry, let alone commit suicide. You will suffer so much in your life. You are not worthy of being a man. You don't want to go to any social gatherings outside. You earn face for social gatherings outside, but you blame me with stinky words. I don't agree! You say, what ugly things did I do with Jingbo? I will confront Jingbo with you!" As she said, she really came to drag Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen was sitting on a small stool in a daze, trembling with anger. Unexpectedly, she dragged him with force, and he fell down. He still had some masculine spirit after all. He stood up, shook off his right arm, and pushed his wife. She didn't stand firmly and also fell to the ground. She stood up, knowing that she couldn't match a man in strength, so she could only use the things on the table to throw. Teapots, teacups, goldfish glass tanks, vases, cigarette dishes, everything was smashed.</p>
<p>(I only said one sentence, but you babbled a lot. Throwing things like this, what kind of decency is this! Give me some peace!)</p>
<p>(What is wrong with my peace that I have to be scolded by you? Give me proof. Insulting me like this, I will never let you off!)</p>
<p>They were arguing in the house, and Mr. Li could hear it. He walked over to knock on the door, wanting to persuade them, but he also heard Mr. Chen arguing, mentioning his name. Feeling guilty, he didn't dare to go. He knew that Mrs. Chen was very flexible and would never make a fuss about men coming home late at night, so he didn't sympathize much with Lanzhen, but Mr. Chen was feminine and secretly helped Lanzhen everywhere. The unrest in my family may have been caused by Mr. Chen saying bad things. The more Mr. Li thought about it, the more he hated Mr. Chen. But he had extraordinary admiration for Mrs. Chen.</p>
<p>To avoid disharmony in the family, he had to comfort his wife. He made up this reason and said to Lanzhen, "Listen! They are arguing, and things are being smashed. I wonder who is smashing them? Are you feeling better? Go and persuade them!"</p>
<p>"I have a headache and can't get up; you go!" Lanzhen had endured for a long time without saying a word, but now she spoke. Mr. Li knew that since she had spoken, it was a sign that she had calmed down, and he felt relieved.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Trends in Disorder</h3>
<p>▲ Gold Fluctuation: Yesterday, the 11th, the gold market situation was chaotic. The morning market recovered from weakness to strength, but the afternoon market tended to be sluggish, creating waves and appearing as rapid as lightning. A total of eight taels changed hands throughout the day. In the end, the price still rose by one tael, causing people to feel quite bewildered. The receipts and disbursements of the large firms were complicated, making it difficult to cope. As for the silver market, although it fell, it was not affected. It was probably due to Citibank making purchases, so the opening was low. However, foreign exchange became tight. Soon after, various parties were competing to buy, and it was heard that London silver bars seemed to be falling. The market received this news, and speculators eagerly bought in, causing the market sentiment to surge and break through the 770 tael mark. The afternoon market saw a reversal, probably due to the rumor that Bombay would expand the use of silver coins, causing a selling spree in the market and creating waves. Almost, the exchange rate also became loose and excessive. It is estimated that British gold rose from one shilling and three pence to three pence and one eight seven five, causing a sudden drop of more than seven taels to a little over sixty-three taels. Finally, it showed a slight peace. According to people in the industry, the current short selling may have to pay out, which is the opposite of the previous period, because the cash reserves are not abundant, and a certain bank may collect a huge number of 10,000 several thousand bars, which is forced by the short position, so the market price once rose, and the longs want to squeeze the shorts.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Market From Weak to Strong: At the opening of the October futures in the morning, it immediately fell by one tael and one qian to 763 taels and 8 qian. Then it fell by three taels and five qian. Large bars fell slightly by one-sixteenth, and silver prices fell by one-eighth. U.S. stocks fell by more than one yuan. However, the European market tended to be strong, so it did not rise. However, Fuyu, Hengxingwan, and Hengyu Shunli all came to compete for purchases, immediately going upward, and the British gold Xiuli Bank ate October one three, so it has increased by four or five taels. When the British gold was announced, it was 68 and a half taels, and the listing did not change. At that time, Daxing, Yongzhi Feng, Yongfu Yu, and Wu sold it, so it went downstream. At 10 o'clock, it was 65 taels and 9 qian. Then, the Heng bank ate November British gold one three two two five, and Hengxing, Daxing, Yongyuan Xing, Yongcheng Feng, Yongheng Xing, Yuansen Changyong Lu, Wu and others dragged in one after another. Also, the British gold Yiting only ate in one three, and Bingxing and others also bought it, because it was rumored that large bars had the ability to fall, reaching a peak and it was reported that a certain bank's purchase intention was not slack, causing the price to rise by five or six taels. Occasionally, there was a disk head of one or two taels. At about 11 o'clock, it was 71 taels and 8 qian, and then Fuchang and Hedgers sold it. Wanhsing Shunli also sold one after another, especially because various banks sold November British gold one three, the gold price fell by two taels, and at 11:30 it was 69 taels and 7 qian. After that, the Indian exchange rate went down slightly, so it rose by one tael every quarter of an hour to seven taels and two qian. By the time of closing, the price was still calculated at 790 taels and two qian, pressing about 20 taels inside.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Market With Frequent Turmoil: The afternoon market opened at 69 taels and 4 qian, and then rose to 70 taels and 8 qian due to the Indian exchange rate reporting a small two anna, and Yuanmao Yongyuan Xingyong Yuanmao and others sold, and then retreated to 67 taels and 7 qian, and suddenly Qianchangxiang and others came in, and it was reported that a certain bank continued to buy. The British gold almost closed one three, and at 2:30 it was 70 taels and 8 qian, but the hearts of the people were not firm, and it seemed that everyone was keen on selling, so it was difficult to break through 71 taels. Soon after, it was suddenly heard from abroad that India would resume the use of silver coins, so Fuchang Zhifeng Yongfu Yu and Taichang and various exchange dealers tended to sell, and immediately a storm broke out, plummeting by six or seven taels, and British gold followed the loose bank to eat one eight seven five, and then even returned to two five, and it was heard that Chen also sold. At 3:30, it ended up at 63 taels and 2 qian, but the Guang Gang's buying momentum was more constant, and it had been pulled up by more than three taels. At 4 o'clock, it was 6 taels and 8 qian, followed by 5 taels and 2 qian, and then 6 taels and 7 qian. This is the trend of maneuvering, and British gold could be sold at one eight seven five at the end. The market closed at 4:30 at 65 taels and 9 qian, one tael more than the previous day. According to the day's maximum 71 taels and 8 qian, the minimum 63 taels and 2 qian, the difference is 8 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<p>▲ There are not many spot transactions. In the morning market, four taels and five were received at nine taels and eight qian, nine taels and eight qian in the afternoon, and six taels at the close. The opening price was suppressed by a small 20 taels to 24 or 5 taels, and the registration was 67 taels and 7 qian. The water replenishment was 67 taels and 63 taels. The spot red bars were flat. Yingfeng Heng and the industry had mutual transactions, totaling 7 taels and 7 qian 5.</p>
<p>▲ Transactions Are Extremely Inconsistent: There are various transactions on the table. According to statistics, Hengxing, Yifeng, Chengfeng Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Yuansen Changyong, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Richang, Yuanxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Hengchang Yong, etc. all entered, Fuchang and Fuyu first entered and then exited, Wanxing, Shunli, and Dadecheng exited with more people exiting than entering. Yuanmao Yong, Yu Da, Futaiheng, and Cuichang Yong all exited. Daxing Yong, Yuantai, Yuanmao, Huixiang, and Bingxing initially exited and then paid in. Yuanmao Yong Tonghe sold more than 1,300 bars, and speculators Wu and Lu both entered. In the afternoon, Tong Taichang, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuanxing Yong, Yuanmao, Cuichang Yong, Yongfeng, and Chengfeng Yong all exited, and a certain bank entered. Wanxing, Yifeng, Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, and Dadecheng all entered. Yuancheng and Shunli also exited. The receipts and disbursements of other firms were diverse. Guang Gang entered 4,500 bars, and Dalian Gang entered and exited a total of more than 2,000 bars, breaking even, but yesterday it still occupied a short position.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Rebound</h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 11th: Silver prices rebounded again. The closing price for the near term was 13 pence 0625, and the far term was 13 pence 125, an increase of 125 compared to the telegram on the 10th for both near and far terms.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Suddenly Entered a Slump in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported declines, but the market seemed firm, probably because the United States made purchases. The Shanghai market was quite complicated. Because it was rumored in the morning that the London market's large bars had a bearish trend, British gold and other trends were outstanding. Later in the afternoon, it was suddenly heard that Bombay planned to resume the use of silver coins, and the market suddenly turned into a slump. The gold market completely collapsed, confused and volatile, and the hearts of the people were unsettled. As a result, British gold was slightly longer by 0.0625 compared to the day before, American gold by 125, and Japanese gold by half a point. However, the HSBC listing remained unchanged, except for Hong Kong falling by 125, calculated at 80 taels 0125. Huashang transactions were not fresh. There were receipts and disbursements of British gold, and the total number of sales was slightly higher, totaling approximately 200,000 pounds. Also, American gold was only more than 200,000 yuan, and Japanese gold was only tens of thousands of yuan in and out, and the market was not allowed to fluctuate.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Internal Disk: Calculated with 125 rises and falls, the asking price in the morning was one shilling three pence to 0625, the buying price was 0625 to 125, Shanghai entered October three pence, and then Youli Zhengjin Shanghai Mitsui Sumitomo all entered November 125, Shanghai entered three pence, Mitsui Youli Da Ying sold three pence, and the noon closing asking price was 9375 to three pence, and the buying price was plus 0625. In the afternoon, Youli Netherlands did October, and Mitsui issued October, both for three pence, Mitsui and Pangen issued October three pence 0625, Taiwan entered December 125, Mitsui Shanghai entered 1875, Zhengjin entered November 1875, the closing asking price was 0625 to 125, and the buying price was 125 to 1875.</p>

The closing asking price in the afternoon was one tael six qian two points, and the buying price was one tael six qian one and a half points.</p>
<h3>American Silver Price Also Shrunk by 125</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I received a telegram from New York (dated the 10th). The American silver price also shrank by 125. The spot price was 27.875 cents, and the exchange rate between British and American dollars did not change, remaining at 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 9375. The exchange rate between American and British dollars decreased by 125 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 8125. The exchange rate between Japanese and American dollars remained at 49 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen, and the exchange rate between British and Japanese dollars was still calculated at 2 shillings 032 shares of 13. The London-Shanghai shilling was shorter by 125, calculated at 1 shilling 3 pence 1875. The Bombay spot price decreased by 4 anna to 43 rupees 10 anna, and the forward price also decreased by a small 4 anna, calculated at 43 rupees 12 anna, etc.</p>
<h3>Silver Root Suddenly Tightened</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Yesterday's silver dollar market sentiment, the discount rate still seemed similar, but the silver dismantling was particularly tight. The reason for this is that the general trend is difficult to announce clearly, and even the financial sector knows little about it. In general, the current natural and man-made disasters have a huge impact on commerce. Judging from the facts and the situation, the silver root in this month may be more expensive than last month, which is also unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲ Discount Rate Price (Yuan Li): The morning market discount rate was 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half. The noon market was slightly better by 1 hao 2 hu and a half, at 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half. (Silver Dismantling): 1 qian 5 fen in the morning market, 1 qian 6 fen in the noon market, a sudden increase of 8 or 9 fen compared to the previous day. The bank listed at 6 fen, and the head division plus water also had a market of 1 qian 5 or 6 fen. The current situation of tightness and looseness is very different from the previous day.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small foreign coins were more expensive by 1 li, at 6 qian 6 fen 1 li. The morning and noon markets were also the same. In terms of trading volume, 6,000 corners were traded in the morning market, and 4,000 corners were traded in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 qian 5 fen 1 li 7 hao and a half in the morning market, and 6 qian 5 fen 2 li in the noon market. In terms of trading volume, 150,000 corners were traded in the morning market, and 65,000 corners were traded in the noon market. Copper coins continued to shrink by 500 characters, at 370,500 characters.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollar In and Out (Silver Funds): Yesterday's bank receipt and disbursement news included Chinese merchants receiving and disbursing more than 2.3 million in ticket funds, foreign merchants receiving and disbursing more than 1.7 million in ticket funds, various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds totaling 9.34 million, special funds totaling more than 1 million, entering the warehouse 800,000, exiting the warehouse 300,000, Japanese merchant banks receiving and disbursing various funds totaling 4.4 million, special funds totaling more than 400,000, entering the warehouse 700,000, Qianzhuang Yinkong single receiving and disbursing more than 49 million, head division funds receiving and disbursing more than 3.8 million, various remittance funds receiving and disbursing more than 900,000, and cash disbursements of more than 1 million.

<h3>Securities and Salt Tax Bonds Soar by Over Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Other Bonds Also Rise by About Two Yuan</p>
<p>Turnover Reaches 28 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market saw significant price fluctuations in futures, with increased trading volume. However, the spot market remained sluggish. Suddenly, a major reversal occurred in the trend of various bond prices, with a fierce surge. In the morning's initial trading session, market sentiment was optimistic, and buying activity picked up. Later, investor confidence grew further, with short positions being covered and bargain-hunting investments being made, leading to even more enthusiastic participation. The imbalance between demand and supply became significant, causing all bond prices to surge collectively. In the afternoon session, the trend slightly moderated, but the bullish sentiment remained. As a result, the October salt tax bond soared by 3.55 yuan, while the September issue and the 20's bonds each rose by over 3 yuan. Other bonds also mostly increased by about 2 yuan. Only the consolidated 6% customs bond of '96 improved by about half a yuan. Furthermore, spot transactions were almost nonexistent, with prices generally trending downwards. Spot trading volume totaled 209,000 yuan, while futures trading in the morning's two sessions amounted to approximately 20 million yuan, and the afternoon session saw over 8.1 million yuan, bringing the total to over 28.1 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Still Mutually Rejecting</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with no discernible gains or losses. The overseas cotton yarn situation remains pessimistic, so speculators have not abandoned their short-selling mindset and have no intention of covering. However, the bulls are also very determined, so the two sides are engaged in fierce opposition. As for current yarn sales, they feel increasingly cold. Each group has not found a large number of transactions. However, new sellers, due to the bottom relationship, feel particularly lacking.</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Futures Show No Gains or Losses In the exchange's cotton futures market, the opening session was soft due to falling overseas cotton prices, and selling pressure was relatively strong, with each month slightly down by 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, news of good gold prices emerged, and prices rose again by 0.1-0.4 yuan. The transaction volume was 13,200 bales. According to investigations, Heshen sold 1,000 bales, Jifeng 550 bales, Ruidai 600 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Gongtai 600 bales, and Yongchang 650 bales. Yongfeng bought 700 bales, Xincheng 550 bales, Gengfeng 450 bales, and Yichang 2-300 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Open Interest</p>
<p>September: 152.7, Up 4, 49,700</p>

<p>January: 151.2, 76,450</p>
<p>February: 151.2, 23,450</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Fail to Improve Current yarn sales are mediocre. According to statistics, all groups purchased a total of 600 bales throughout the day. Peers accounted for 260 bales. The market situation is flat. Customers from Tianjin bought 100 bales, Changsha 50 bales, Guangdong 65 bales, inland 350 bales, and miscellaneous groups 65 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Temporarily Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The cotton market is temporarily stable because domestic production is poor, and holders are watching and have no intention of selling. Therefore, the market is still somewhat firm. However, the situation for American cotton is very pessimistic, and Japanese merchants have not stopped selling. Speculators largely tend to sell. In the afternoon, gold prices were still firm and the weather appeared bad, and confidence suddenly tightened. However, the world cotton market is difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Cotton Afternoon Tightening Exchange Hankou Cotton opened in the morning, American cotton although down, but selling pressure was not strong in the field, each month slightly up by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market tightened again, and each month rose another 0.05 yuan. Transaction statistics were 51,400 piculs. According to investigations, Dafen sold 1,700 piculs, Yuandai 4,200 piculs, Changhe 1,200 piculs, Dachangcheng 3,300 piculs, and Gengfeng 1,400 piculs. Yichang bought 6,000 piculs, Taixing 3,800 piculs, Shenchang 1,500 piculs, and Zhendai 1,400 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>▲ New Yao Cotton Continues to Trade Current cotton transactions are mediocre. Regarding sources, a fire machine flower (low-grade cotton) was traded at 34.25 yuan, with Yongyu Factory taking in 100 bales to be delivered in September.</p>
<p>Another 100 bales at 34.00 yuan, to be delivered in October.</p>
<p>New Yao cotton at 36.40 yuan, with customers taking in 595 bales in spot transactions.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Prices Decline Further</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Bulls Liquidated Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to good news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to selling from the South and liquidation by bulls. Futures fell by 17-19 points, and spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 13-14 points, and spot prices rose by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 25 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later firmed due to increased buying by local bulls. Pingguo'er rose by 2.25 rupees, Robbie rose by 2.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 5 rupees.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Become Scarce and Sales Are Strong</h3>
<p>▲ Southern Market Yesterday, the sources in the southern market were gradually thinning out due to the influence of falling prices in the Shanghai market. The activity of urban and rural shops was even more apparent. Customers also sold due to the frequent declines in recent days and the high cost of shipping this batch to Shanghai. The thick japonica rice market firmed up by another two jiao. There was slightly some accumulated thin rice. The Ningbo market was sluggish, and the local market route was still not thriving. The situation improved a bit. There were few Luyang tip and deteriorated goods, and prices did not fluctuate. New japonica arrivals have turned scarce, and market acceptance is still stable.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha Yesterday, the west road had ships on the 10th, and river stocks were also low. Local shops transacted because of the light rain and frequent news of floods in various places, and confidence rose. Thick japonica middle and second grade rice increased by another 0.2 yuan. Thin early rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the situation followed with an increase of 0.1 yuan. New japonica arrivals and sales are equally matched, and there were no obvious gains or losses. The arrival of ocean Luyang tip rice was also thin, and the customer market was still small. The local market's goods were still active, and prices also rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Prices Fall, Sales Are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation weakened due to the lack of outbound activity in recent days. Yesterday, customers still did not inquire, and sources continued to arrive. Local dealers and consortiums took this opportunity to lower prices and buy. Although prices fell, sales activity was seen instead. It is estimated that 800 bags of small twist rice were sold at a price of 13.2 yuan, 200 bags of Mindang rice were sold at a price of 13.05 yuan, and 500 bags of Saigon road goods of No. 1 were sold at a price of 14.5 yuan, all 0.06-0.15 yuan lower than the previous market. Taizhou rice was also seen to soften, with 500 bags sold at a price of 13.15-12.9 yuan. 500 tons of small twist rice September futures were sold at a price of 6.3 taels, and many were sold, and the market is also expected to have small gains.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Returns to Flat After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a hovering situation in each month. However, foreign wheat was reported to have risen by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Because the current flour sales were active, the manufacturers worked hard in the market to cover positions. In addition to drawing and loading spot flour, the North China sales customers also paid attention to the absorption of period flour. Therefore, the market of each month rose unanimously, rising by 0.015-0.02 yuan more than the closing price of the previous day. Later, some manufacturers and bulls resold, and the market situation saw a rise and then a return to flat. However, the final closing price in September was still up 0.0125 yuan, October was up 0.005 yuan, November was up 0.01 yuan, and December and February were each up 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Bulls Rise Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened, due to the active sales of flour and the reported rise in foreign wheat, the market atmosphere was filled with buying momentum. Although the current wheat market was tired, the manufacturers were active. Therefore, the buying of new bulls was aroused. After the opening of the next year, each month rose unanimously. Because of the reduced chips in the market this month, it was particularly better. As a result, this month was up 0.04 yuan, October was up 0.01 yuan, November was up 0.03 yuan, December was up 0.02 yuan, January was up 0.03 yuan, and February was up 0.02 yuan. 3,500 bags of existing wheat were opened. Fuzhou wheat was 3.61 taels, Dongtai was 3.6 taels, Zhenjiang wheat was 3.57 taels, Taicang wheat was 3.55 taels, and Anqing small grain wheat was 3.14 taels. They were all taken in by Fuxin. Shenda took over 6,000 bags of wheat delivered at the end of last month by the exchange, at a price of 3.67-3.57 taels.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Thin Elephant Skin Raincloth Suddenly Rises by 0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rainwear cloth market has been extremely active recently, with transactions in both single pieces and whole boxes. However, there are fewer transactions for fish skin lining and thin rainwear cloth, because they are generally considered too expensive and are not immediately willing to purchase. Yesterday, the regular blue-gray elephant skin lining rainwear cloth was temporarily sold uniformly at 3.56 taels. The top grade was even in short supply, and the asking price was 3.85 taels. Compared with the previous month, the top two grades rose by about 0.3 yuan per yard. There were no major ups and downs for open-water and other colors of rainwear cloth. Double-sided cloths were still sold at 6.6-6.7 yuan. Single-sided cloths of brands such as Taihe, Deji, Hongsheng, and Zhengchang were uniformly sold at 5.225 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market New Goods Coarse Sand White Opens 1,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Lower Grade Goods Short and Turning Good</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: Cuban spot sugar price was 1.4375, up 0.03125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for September was 1.39, 1.42, up 0.02; May was 1.47, also up 0.01. Java spot sugar price was 7.75, futures for each month was 7.625, both lacking ups and downs. The guild divided the plate for Dutch sugar, No. 24 coarse sand white, the market was very flat and transactions were sparse. New goods were 11.6 taels, old goods were 11.4 taels, oil bags were 11.25 taels, the worst to 10.095 taels. No. 20 medium sand white was 11.1 taels, new goods were 11.25 taels, and the market was also stable. Taikoo car sugar, B mark was 11.95 taels, handlers were silent, and the market was weak. Lower grade goods were short, and the market turned good. DY mark was 11.825-11.875 taels, HX mark was 11.75 taels, HM mark was 11.425 taels, H mark was 10.045 taels. Delivery was very short, and the trend was quite strong. Hao Pan had Jinfahao selling 1,000 bags of new coarse sand white, at a price of 11.6 taels, and the market was not strange, but it was the first sound of spot transactions of Hao Pan after the new goods arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hardware Sales Market Remains Quiet as Before</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview Yesterday's hardware market showed no improvement, and the situation was very sluggish. Although the northern regions of Niuzhuang and Yingkou showed slight purchasing activity, the Yangtze River region still lacked vitality due to floods. The local factories were also sparsely populated because of the abundance of inventory and had no appetite for absorption. Therefore, the quietness of the market remained the same as before.</p>
<p>▲ Order Transactions Recently, there have been almost no order transactions from foreign firms, because the local market is exhausted by oversupply, so each firm has no buyers.</p>
<p>▲ Imports Are Strong Recently, the increase in imports of various goods has been unprecedented in the past three years. Such as tinplate, foreign yuan, bamboo steel bars, plain white iron, French nails, etc. are full of piles. It is estimated that tinplate alone has half a year of sales, and foreign yuan and bamboo steel bars also have more than three or four months of sales. If the source continues to arrive in the future, I am afraid that it will continue to decline.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Yellow White Factory Business Sales Difficult</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market was still difficult to progress. It was found that yellow and white factory businesses, American sales still showed no improvement. Only French firms took the opportunity to cover short positions. Unfortunately, the opening price did not rise, and transactions were difficult to thrive. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others entered 50 packages of Shanghai white factory business, and Kaili entered 20 packages of Sichuan yellow factory business. The price remained firm.</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Shanghai Silk Factories Open Again</h3>
<p>The issuance of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds has exceeded ten days. Most of the silk factories in various ports went to the Public Bond Fund Management Committee to sign agreements to collect bond tickets. After receiving the public bonds, the factories are preparing to resume work. In addition to the more than ten factories that have already started work, there are now more than ten factories, such as Dalai, that have successively started work this week. It is now estimated that 47 single palace silk factories and 6 double palace silk factories are operating in Shanghai. It is expected that the number will continue to increase in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Japanese Tea Sold in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japanese green tea has recently been shipped in large quantities to Shanghai for sale. No Chinese merchants are willing to buy it. It is reported that the British firm Xiehe has purchased 5,000 boxes due to its low tea price, preparing to combine it with Chinese tea and ship it overseas for sale.</p>

<h3>Umbrella</h3>
<p>— Wen Qing</p>
<p>In an island country where all four seasons feel like summer, the misty afternoon rain is like a poet's soul joyfully indulging in beautiful fantasies. Oiled paper umbrellas have become the beloved objects of those who are busy running around in life. Those merchants driven by money, during the more than three-month rainy season, also elaborately manufacture a very exquisite type of umbrella to supply to people's use. Even ordinary umbrellas are shiny and have three or four dazzling colors. Especially the umbrella of Miss Qiuyun, a student at the Xicheng Junior High School, is particularly exquisite and beautiful. It is said that her father bought it for her in a bustling capital city in Europe. Her school is very close to her home. She goes early and returns at noon, goes at noon and returns in the evening. Only during the afternoon rainy days of the more than three months is it annoyingly present. Every day she goes to school to attend classes, a beautiful umbrella follows her footsteps like her good friend. Since when, this beautiful umbrella has been deeply engraved in the heart of Mr. Zhang, the physics teacher.</p>
<p>That stubborn principal built a thick wall between the young teachers and the female students, forbidding male teachers from talking to female students except during classes. But one cannot blame that principal for being so strict, because the minds of those overseas Chinese students are too outdated. They still think like the 18th century and often talk about the story of Empress Dowager Cixi ruling from behind the curtain. But they still don't know what kind of person Empress Dowager Cixi actually was. Male teachers teaching female students are also considered traitors to the old ethics. They send their daughters to school to read Chinese books with trepidation, almost requiring the principal to write a guarantee to put in their hands before they feel at ease. People's mouths are inherently vicious. If a bit of gossip is blown into the ears of their parents, not only will the teacher's job be insecure, but the principal's position will also be fundamentally shaken. It was originally not easy to teach in the layers of oppression of the colonies. Once, the Dutch government inspected books and textbooks in a school, and found the two words "(revolution)" in a student's composition book, and arrested the teacher who corrected the composition and imprisoned him for three months before expelling him from the country. At the same time, in another school, a male teacher called a girl who was under twelve years old "(little sister)," and was also dismissed by the school board. Mr. Zhang was a little afraid of suffering the same misfortune, and kept the pain he had brought upon himself tightly hidden in the depths of his soul. His complexion became paler day by day, and he became thinner day by day. His colleagues even thought he was suffering from anemia and urged him to consult a doctor. I am afraid that there is no doctor in the world who would have such superb skills to cure him.</p>
<p>The owner of the umbrella, Miss Qiuyun's crystal-bead-like eyes, and her onion-like nose, were the raw materials that ignited the flames of love in Mr. Zhang's heart. He was originally a calm and composed young man, but he didn't know how the flames of love, which could not be extinguished by ocean water or seawater, were burning in his heart. Because of the harsh environment, he had no way to burst the flames in his heart. Therefore, distress, sorrow, worry, indifference, etc., all worked together to attack his weak soul, and a cruel longing mercilessly trampled on him. He had been unable to refuse his dreams many times. Sometimes he firmly rejected temptation, but temptation was stronger, and he was weaker than usual.</p>
<p>He originally did not like to smoke, but now he can often be seen releasing dense smoke from his nostrils. He wanted to turn his idleness and sorrow into green smoke and dissipate them into the boundless sky, but the smoke still circled around him. This long cloud of smoke seemed to shroud his gray fate, and he seemed to have no way to escape.</p>
<p>One afternoon, with heavy rain pouring down, he sat silently by the window, but who didn't know what he was thinking in his heart. In front of his dormitory were rows of dark green banana trees and coconut trees, their tears glistening, standing silently under the gloomy sky. His gazelle-like eyes, through the gaps in the coconut leaves, could see pedestrians on the road passing by in the heavy rain with umbrellas. He couldn't help but think of Miss Qiuyun's beautiful umbrella again. His lonely heart sank into a sad dream again. The sound of rain hitting banana leaves outside the window was like merciless cold bullets hitting his heart, causing him pain. His surroundings seemed to be filled with terrifying air, and his tears fell inexplicably like the sorrowful rain outside the window. He took out a white silk handkerchief from his pocket, gently wiped the tears from his cheeks, and lit another cigarette, because smoking was his only way to pass the time. Smoke filled the low and poorly lit room. He smoked and paced back and forth in the room, his eyes fixed on the ground. Undisciplined thoughts flowed backward in his brain like a raging flood. He lay down on the bed again, staring blankly at the white ceiling, lost in thought. Suddenly, a piece of unextinguished cigarette ash fell on his left cheek, burning a scar the size of a soybean, but he didn't seem to realize it. It is conceivable to what extent his nerves were deranged.</p>
<p>That day, when his class was over, he returned to his dormitory, lay on the bed, and rested his tired spirit. When a passionate fantasy was rushing through his mind, suddenly Miss Xi in the next room made a sound of calling her servant.</p>
<p>(Renna, Renna, quickly take Miss Qiuyun's umbrella to school. I just borrowed it. Hurry up, she's going home!)</p>
<p>When he heard the shadow of this voice containing Qiuyun's beautiful name, he immediately jumped out of bed and ran out of the door, three steps at a time. He saw that the beautiful umbrella was already in the hands of that rude servant. He rushed to the door and shouted,</p>
<p>(Renna, Renna, I'm going to the school. I'll take the umbrella for you!)</p>
<p>(No, this is Miss Qiuyun's umbrella. Mr. Xi wants me to take it over.)</p>
<p>(I know, I'll give it to her for you.)</p>
<p>He took the umbrella and held it tightly in his hand, as if he was holding his own life. After he walked out of the door, he realized that he was only wearing a white shirt and shorts. He usually loved to be handsome, but at this time he didn't care about anything, just rushing towards the school. His gazelle-like eyes glanced around the school, but he did not see Miss Qiuyun's figure in his eyes. Immediately, a sense of disappointment tightened his eyebrows. He simply placed the lovely umbrella lightly in the corner of the office, and ran to the window to look out. It turned out that Miss Qiuyun was still buried in her work, working on a composition in the classroom. At that time, a kind of inexplicable joy rose from his brain, eliminating the sorrow of disappointment without a trace. He stood outside like a puppet, waiting foolishly. He thought to himself, he wanted to take the opportunity of handing the umbrella to her to muster the courage to put the umbrella in her hand. He finally mustered the courage to walk up to her and gently asked her,</p>
<p>(Miss Wang, is your composition finished? So fast. Are you coming to school at four o'clock this afternoon?... Oh, this is your umbrella. Mr. Xi asked me to bring it over for you.)</p>
<p>(Thank you, sir.) She bowed, lowered her head, took her umbrella, and went home in the drizzle with her satchel. His disappointed eyes could only follow her slender figure.</p>
<h3>Showing Off Skills</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziwei</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, a lot of people were crowding inside and outside the playground.</p>
<p>Yu was dressed more neatly than usual. He stood at the entrance of the playground, watching intently where people were coming from. The dark pupils in his black face sparkled, which would feel kind of cute and mysterious. Actually, mostly because they paid attention to Yu, everyone was crowding in front of the door, pointing and saying,</p>
<p>(Yu is going to do the high jump again today.)</p>
<p>The impression given was that deep. Everyone was there for him. Since a foot injury, he hadn't been seen practicing on this playground once. Even at the recent World Games, he hadn't prepared. Although he didn't think much of it, he still got a place at the World Games. He said that he unfortunately came in fourth because he was careless. Before the National Games, he was practicing on this playground. His friends thought he was working harder, wanting to see his performance earlier.</p>
<p>When Yu took off his coat and revealed a light blue vest and dark blue shorts, and exposed a pair of black and shiny arms and thighs, the muscles were bulging like a Roman general's idol. From a modern perspective, he had a dignified and healthy beauty. Really, I'm not being corny. The implication of the muscles was that of bravery. But there were also things that made you suspicious, suspicious that he couldn't compete with the huge foreigners. His short stature made it hard to believe that he could jump higher than foreigners.</p>
<p>When the high jump started, he was as light and agile as a swallow, as natural as a red carp jumping out of the water. The posture was graceful, and when he jumped, his body trembled, saying that he would rise even higher. After several jumps, he was on the slope, facing sideways, flying towards the center of the bamboo pole. When his body left the ground, his feet were turned back, higher than his head. You would worry about him, not to be nice, wouldn't he fall to his death? Miraculously, his feet passed the pole, and then they were turned upright again. As for the falling-to-death posture, people say that it's the earth's gravity, sucking up from the soles of the feet. I say, perhaps so.</p>
<p>The jumping enclosure was getting smaller and smaller, especially the children standing in the front row wanted to go forward to see more closely.</p>
<p>(Little brother, stand back a bit, let him jump higher so you can see,) Yu's friend Huang, he took care of the field, saying.</p>
<p>(Everyone look, hey, it's one meter seventy-five,) Cao, who was standing at the jumping stand, announced.</p>
<p>After the shout of "hey," it attracted everyone's attention. From Cao's line of sight, they turned to where Cao was looking. Strange, where did this miss come from, haven't seen her before. Like this, later on, the spectators were even busier. When they had a chance, they had to move their line of sight to look at her.</p>
<p>After passing one meter seventy-five, he didn't jump again afterwards.</p>
<p>After it dispersed, Yu wasn't seen.</p>
<p>Chen, nicknamed "Robber" in the ×× basketball team, said,</p>
<p>(Yu jumped high for her to see, to show off his skills.)</p>
<p>(Who is she?) someone asked.</p>
<p>(……)</p>
<p>(Oh, showing off his skills……) I said.</p>
<p>(Robber is speculating, Cao's report is also questionable,) I thought to myself on the way home, (Early autumn is full of the gentle meaning of spring, spring is like a dream, people need to change, really, early autumn is like spring.)</p>

<h3>Life of Professional Women in New York</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Yasou was waiting for her in the hallway of a hotel. He was smart enough not to iron his clothes too flat every time she saw him. This afternoon, they talked freely, from the Dutch tunnels passing through the Hudson River to the latest dramas. Yasou still had no concept of worship. She felt attracted several times. Anyone who was colorful and good at fun could give her this feeling.</p>
<p>Yasou accompanied her back to the office. She had a magazine advertisement to be printed. The entire portion had been planned and drawn. All that was needed was for Maolin to write the manuscript. She had been thinking about this topic for several days. She knew to bring up the most prominent point, but she spent two hours of work to get this advertisement done. She handed it over to the publisher, who forwarded it to the printer. About two days later, Maolin wanted to read the first draft. At first, she looked at it alone, then she looked at it with the client to sort out the places that needed to be modified, and finally handed it over to the magazine for publication.</p>
<p>At half past four, Maolin decided to go home. She had a cup of tea on the way. After leaving the teahouse, she hired a street</p>
