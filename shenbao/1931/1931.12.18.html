<h3 id="c22">官僚政治與專家政治 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>我國政治之窳敗。至於今日。可謂已極。吾人言此。並非以着色之眼光。故作苛刻之批評。以歸咎政體或政府之形式。英詩人蒲樸曾有言。「政府的形式。讓傻子們去爭。最好的行政。是最好的政府。」故吾人今日所欲言者。亦非爲政體。非爲政治之形式。但問政府如何。政府之行政如何。政府之行政如何。言及今日之政治。蓋可以一言爲斷。曰「官僚政治。」人有恒言。「政治舞臺。」此蓋狀政治如演劇。滄桑變幻。瞬息萬態。而從事政治者。則爲劇臺上之角色。嗔喜笑啼。無可捉摸。然而我國今日之政治。不僅爲舞臺而。實爲一團死水。其從事於所謂政治者。不僅爲劇中人。而實爲死水中叢攢之蛆固然。吾人所言。要亦有其例外。然而舉目滔滔。此營營逐逐萬頭攢集於一團死水之現象。吾人殆無法否認。更無可諱言。</p>
<p>今日之從政者。但以力而不以能。但以詭而不以正。力愈大。詭愈多。則位愈高。勢愈炫赫。於是而奔走者盈其門。阿諛者承其顔色。逢迎其意志。助長其惡。使其自視巍然與民隔離。力之次大者。則位次要。力再次。則位亦再次。至於其是否有爲政之能。爲政之才。是否才能稱其職。職能盡其才。非人所問。尤非小民所敢問。於是人皆以「做官」爲「發財」之捷徑皆以卑鄙逢迎爲求官之門路。依附欋勢。奴顔婢色。蠅營苟苟攢逐無所不用其極。患得患失。排擠傾軋。更無所不用其極。於是而密佈要津者。皆爲權勢之故舊。巍然臨民者。皆爲權勢之戚友。甚且一人而兼攬多職。遥領空銜。一若天下之大。惟我爲能於是而無官不貪。無官而不剥削民衆。官愈肥而民愈瘦。官愈居尊養貴。而民輾轉流離。歸死無所。從政者但以政治爲職業。爲生活。至何謂政。何謂治。皆非所問故　以致今日之盜匪如毛。内亂連綿。外患煎逼。民處塗炭。敢怒而不敢言。近二十年來之政治史。充盈篇幅。但爲血爲滬。爲卑鄙爲齷濁。爲勢之炫耀爲陰險之傾擠。爲毒之爭持。謂爲官僚政治。詎豈爲過。</p>
<p>雖然。今兹所言。固爲不可諱飾之事實然而惟勇者乃能承認眞實之事實。亦惟勇者乃能接受事實之敎訓。從而求出路今日時局已急轉直下。政治已有新生之機。故今日之從政者。必以絶大之努力。絶大之决心。陳死新生。澄清此一團死水。一切都從新開頭。</p>
<p>澄清之道爲何曰從政必以專家。蓋國家如一部機器。機器利於用。利於用得其宜。爲大衆造福利然而欲求機器之能得其用。能用之有利。則必其全部機構皆極健全。皆能得其用。若以齒輪爲引擎。以靱帶充輪軸。材不得其用。而用不得其材。則機器之機能停滯。而成爲廢物矣。政治亦然。從政者應各有專長。各有專責。有才必爲國用。而國亦必用其才。使從政者各能稱其職。各能盡其能夫然後庶政盡舉國家之機能。得以靈活而無礙。若以長於敎育者司實業。長於科學者主外交。長於軍事者事民政。或更以一無所長。一無所能。而以政治之重責私相授受。以酬庸報功。動止舉措。皆失其常。如中風易。則政治安得而不混亂國脈民命安得而不日益步入絶境。故際此新生起死之絶好機會吾人深盼黨政領袖。能以絶大之努力。下絶大之决心。摧毁官僚政治之根基。厲行專家政治。慎勿令後之視今。亦猶今之視昔。而徒令人感喟愴傷於無窮。</p>

<p>一、總說</p>
<p>先總理嘗謂「革命之基礎建在高深的學問」、易言之「即革命必須具學問、而求學問亦必須革命、」革命之目的在建設、建設之首要在人才、大學乃文化淵藪陶鑄人才之所也、宜乎彚集千慮、權輿萬物、有學府之稱而學府之一切學問胥難溢出三民主義之範圍、是故三民主義乃世界一切學問之集體結晶、而規模萬有者也舉凡關於政治經濟與夫文化的社會科學自然科學及哲學文學等、莫不系屬於民族民權民生三種主義分别作用與連環作用之下、吾人欲完成總理遺志、切實推行三民主義則任何學術、無往而不需用、試問在總理三民主義所範圍以外、世界上尚遺有何種學術乎、故今日號稱最高學府之大學敎育、祇求在三民主義之中、作育羣英、明體達用、以竟其使命、而今日之革命青年、爲社會上最有希望之大學學生、亦祇求在三民主義之中、擇定一種學問、專心致志、念兹在兹、以蔚成有用之材、</p>
<p>二·三民主義之精神</p>
<p>（一）新舊成系統　先總理積四十年之革命經騐、其所詔示吾人者、曰恢復固有民族精神及自信力、曰以吾國格致誠正修齊治平之政理、爲世界政治哲學之極軌、曰承襲吾國堯舜禹湯文武周公孔子之正統思想、而以博愛精神、爲國民革命、爲人類革命、以實現吾民族理想之大同世界、總理手創民國、身爲革命領袖、巨眼炯光、師表萬方、紹承我先哲之傳統文化思想、而以三民主義擷其綱領樹爲原則、西哲華勒斯（GWa　as）著社會遺産（SocialHeritage）一書、有謂一人類有時以廣大而自覺之努力、以測定傳授其社會全部之遺産、且使新者與舊者成爲系統之關係、則蘇格拉底時代之希臘、文藝復興時代之意入利、革命時代之法蘭西是也、是故革命不難、革命而能使新舊成爲系統之關係、以測定傳授其社會全部之遺産者則爲難、法國大革命破壞至八十餘年之久、華氏猶樂爲稱道使其生於今日洞悉先總理革命之眞諦、則其讚歎不知又將何如也、嗚呼、總理之主義博大精深、承先啟後、固淵源於吾國數千年之舊文化思想、而發揮光大廿世紀之新時代潮流自其横者觀之、爲適者生存、自其縱者觀之、則爲永遠生存、</p>
<p>（二）奮鬥非鬥爭總理一生盡瘁革命、而於彌留之際、猶須呼曰「和平奮鬥救中國」夫救中國必須奮鬥、奮鬥必須出之以和平、奮鬥而不能和平、則演爲鬥爭、鬥爭則有違總理博愛之遺訓、禮云、「奮至德之光、易云、一雷出地奮、」是奮鬥有發揚震動之意其爲道也、至大至剛、論語、「君子所爭、」此奮鬥不與鬥爭類也、猶憶昔者、</p>
<p>「項王謂漢王曰、「天下匈匈數歲者、徒以吾兩人耳、願與漢王挑戰、决雌雄、毋徒苦天下之民父子爲也、」漢王笑謝曰、「吾甯鬥智、不能鬥力」見史記、</p>
<p>是鬥智者即奮鬥、鬥力者乃鬥爭、奮鬥具聰明·邁進·仁勇·堅毅之精神、鬥爭爲殘忍·慘酷·暴戾·掠奪之行爲、奮鬥與鬥爭之分野、於此可以思過半矣、</p>
<p>（三）和平救世界　總理全民革命之目的、不僅在求國内各民族之解放、且求全世界人類之自由平等、以共躋於大同、試觀國際形勢、輓近愈趨愈劣、英德各國現均處於水深火熱之中、其蒙受外方經濟壓迫、與我之受迫於日帝國之武力、程度殆不相上下當兹世界經濟危機、已演成國際政治問題社會制度、業趨於顚躓歧途之頃、現狀組織、日就途窮、未來隱憂和平難期、惟三民主義爲和平進化之階梯、爲絶處逢生之救星、即以土地問題而論、世界學者不知絞盡幾許腦汁、迄難解决中國昔在周朝實行井田制度漢朝實行王田制度、北魏改行均田制度、南宋改行官田制度、然制度雖多、而推行寡效、徒滋弊擾、結果仍流於不良之私有制度、總理本均等原則、用和平方法、實行平均地權、開數千年來未有之創制、益以節制資本、滅絶壟斷發展公共事業、富國裕民解决中國之社會問題、而予世界各國以同一之目標、即進而與全世界人類提携、謀財配之均允、使咸相安居樂業、以實現民有民治民享王道大同之世、故吾人服膺總理遺敎切不可忘却總理整個全民革命之目的、在救世界、使先總理和平救世界之精神、不爲曲解誤解之所蔽、盡情畢露得與天下以共見、博國際之同情、至少在國内可免、共産主義與國家主義極端思潮之猖獗、外則可免帝國主義之循環侵略、蓋帝國主義者、倘能嘹然於吾國之實行三民主義、謀民族之解和、求人民之三民主義與大學敎育、（未完）</p>

<p>▲敎員們·學生們·其各　省</p>
<p>救國不是空談所能有濟、也不是貼標語呼口號、罷課游行、打電報發宣言所能有效的凡是從事救國工作的人們、自已必須有一種確實愛國的表示、以身作則、始終不渝、然後所言所行、纔能取信於人、纔有效力、否則不待五分鐘過後、就在最初的幾分鐘、也没有人會相信他們是眞救國的、</p>
<p>現在最熱心救國而且犧牲最大的、當然是學生、學生所以有如此愛國心的激發、當然是敎育的效果、國家危險到這般出地、僅有少數的智識份子、能熱心救國、奔走呼號、已經是很可憐很可憐的事、但是這少數的救國者、他們本身有實在愛國的表示、可令人取信嗎、我却不敢回答、你看現在的大學生們、差不多没有一個不是西裝革履、女學生們差不多没有一個不是外國大衣高跟皮鞋、他們和她們身上裝飾的材料、差不多全是外國貨、愛國青年口褒、天天喊着打倒帝國主義、但是同是很踴躍很恭順地把金錢奉送給帝國主義者、購買他們所出的裝飾材料穿起來、自以爲時髦、自以爲榮耀、這是多麽自相矛盾的救國行爲呀、</p>
<p>青年救國者有如此自相矛循的行爲、所以他們的犧牲、上不能見諒於政府、下不能取信於民衆、政府之不見諒、近來已顯而易見、民衆之不表同情、或疑爲非事實、然而曾經到過鄉間宣傳的學生們、就應該知道鄉下人是如何對我們冷淡、並且我們要知道這些鄉下人在全國人口中還是佔百分之八十以上、有一次學生在鄉間演講抵制日貨、鄉下人就說「我們鄉下人向來没有用外國貨、祗要你們學生自已不用日貨好啦」、眞的、我們現在試拿一個聲聲口口談愛國的男學生女學生和一個不知愛國爲何物的鄉曲土老或村姑娘來比較一下、一個是外國帽子·西裝·手錶·自來水筆·皮鞋·大衣等等、全身上没有一件東西、不是外國貨、一個是布帽子·藍布衫褲·布鞋子等等全身找不出一件外國貨兩相比較、試問到底誰是愛國、誰是不愛國、</p>
<p>抵制日貨、已經有八九次之多了、抵制的時間、最長的亦不過六個月、並且在抵制的前後、日貨進口照例激增、所以效果終等於零、這抵制失效的原因、很明白的是國人没有愛用國貨的决心、尤其是自命愛國的青年男女、言行不相符、崇拜外國貨的心理太重、所以今天受了日本人的欺負、抵制日貨、用英貨或他國貨、明天受了英國人的欺負、又抵制英貨用日本貨或他國貨、抵來抵去、結果祇是替外國人發財、中國的漏巵、只是一年一年的增多、貧窮的現象、只有一年一年的加甚、縱使没有帝國主義的武力侵略、中國國民經濟的破産、也已經顯現在眼前、</p>
<p>中國科學不發達、外國機械和各種工業品之輸入、是自然的趨勢獨有服裝的材料、中國很完備、實在可以不必用外貨、自從以穿西裝爲時髦的心理、由敎育界積極提倡、到了現在、確是十二分普遍於全國各階級了、穿西裝的、用外國材料、那是當然的事、自不足怪、但是穿中裝的、也要直貢呢做馬褂嗶嘰做袍子、喬其紗印度綢做旗袍這眞是何苦呢、外國貨旣在「衣被中國」了、於是、原有的絲綢業一落千丈、土布銷路幾乎斷絶、假使現在没有外國衣料進口、中國一定有大部分人要裸體、</p>
<p>考中國人穿西裝的風氣流行、不過是最近二十的的事、在四十年前、中國第一流的外交家如李鴻章曾紀澤輩、第一流的留學生如嚴復辜鴻銘輩、他們在外國的時候、仍舊穿着中國服裝拖着辮子、二十年前的留學生在外國雖然穿西裝、但回國之後便改換中裝、辮子剪斷、不能復續、於是在小帽子裏裝着一條假的小辮、現在人也許會說他們是頑固、可是他們的確是學貫中西、他一們君子其學也博其服也鄉」的態度、尤非現在一般留學生所能及、自從什麽總統號什麽皇后號把整百整千的鍍金博士碩士陸續不斷地載回國來以後、他們除了說洋話寫洋字之外恐怕人家還不知道他們是如何「博」如何「碩」、於是絶對不用中國服裝、表示他們是不同凡俗、高人一等、這些博士碩士的最大用途、當然是在學校裡敎書、於是大學生以至於中學生甚而小學生、都上行下效、逐漸逐漸地摹仿他們敎師的裝飾、預備做將來的博士碩士、於是洋行夥計公司跑街、甚而至於流氓拆白堂子淫娃之流、亦西其裝而革其履、冒充新時代的新人物、西裝旣然出盡風頭、落伍的中裝、可憐只有鄉曲土老村嫗和没有錢的人穿了幸而現在學生的數目、在全國人口中還是佔極少數、等到將來敎育實在普及之時、就是中裝完全消滅之日、那時候所有國貨綢緞莊以及土布店都要關門、做國貨衣料的工人都要餓死、（未完）</p>

<p>▲今村悖謬宣言　該艦隊抵滬後上　　海日本僑民及海軍官佐、於昨日歡宴該隊官佐學生時、總司令今村信太郎、發布宣言、大致謂、本艦隊由日開出、經朝鮮南滿青島等處來滬、此來之主要目的、在使兩艦中之士官學生明瞭滿蒙山東之形勢、因大連爲南滿之門户、滿蒙又爲朝鮮之門户、青島爲山東之門户、該三處爲帝國向來國防上經濟上之重要土地、爲海軍士官學生所必需明知者也、將來經濟戰爭·國防戰爭、本隊各艦及官佐學生等、須立在第一戰綫奮鬥者、更不可不使之認識云云、其侵略之野心、言詞之謬悖、即此一篇宣詞、已足證明其處心積慮矣、</p>

<p>▲客商查察　大德輪各裝貨客商、以此次被燬、所裝之貨有無焚餘、尚無確報、爲求明瞭眞相及當時情形起見、特會同各保險行、於昨日由公司特開大豫輪、於上午六時起椗赴失事地點查察、</p>

<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>南匯縣城建自清初康熙年間。其舊址本爲南匯衛城。明嘉靖間戚繼光所建。所以衛海塘。防倭冦也。戚住於城内。即友人謝蓉生所居之屋。屋不甚廣。而式甚古。五十年前謝之尊人燕香先生。以廉價得諸戚裔。燕香善畫花卉。不亞白陽。與改七薌齊名。遷入後。　匠修葺。明窗净几。渙然一新。工竣時與藝林至交。揮翰其中。怡然自得。惟每逢陰雨兼旬。屋脊内時發異聲。謝素倔强。不以爲異。一夕約友輩小飮書齋中。談及往事。有勸其他遷者。謝漫應之。酒蘭燭　。其聲又作。絶似紙鳶之筝絃聲。羣客警駭。翌日謝喚匠拆屋角。忽發見古劍一口。裝飾古雅。鋒利絶倫。柄嵌銀絲小箓戚繼光三字。乃始恍然悟寳劍作龍吟也。邑人聞之。咸以一覩爲幸。今不知尚爲寳藏否。暇當叩之蓉生。翌歲中日失和。鋒烟陡起。水陸軍一敗墮地。豈神物有知。而預作出鞘不平之鳴耶。誌之以見戚將軍之威靈不泯焉。</p>

<p>人類的社會好比是一個圓圈。這圓圈我稱它爲生存圈。有些人是安安穩穩的住在圓圈的中心呌做生存圈心的人·其餘的是人山人海的擁擠在圓圈的邊沿呌做生存圈邊的人。</p>
<p>什麽是生存圈心的人？什麽是生存圈邊的人？這在他們所穿的衣服上可以分别得出。</p>
<p>生存圈心的人所穿的衣服不但是春夏秋冬，四季齊備，二十四節氣中每節氣所穿的衣服都有幾套恰恰與這節氣相合。而且早衣，午有午衣，晚有晚衣，下雨有雨衣，吃飯有餐衣，洗澡有浴衣，安眠有睡衣。一個人的衣箱可以把一個房子裝滿。從前康有爲在西安過冬，劉鎭華問他要什麽皮衣可以照辦。康有爲拿起筆來一揮大大小小便開了七十二件。這七十二件裘衣他得到没有，不得而知，可是這個單子却是代表了一個想做生存圈心的人的野心。</p>
<p>昨天晚上我和一位小朋友走過一家小當典門口，看見一個人拿了一包衣服來當，我們便跟他進去看了一忽兒。掌櫃的把衣包打開，都是一些夏天的衣服，一共當了五元錢，他當時又拿了一張當票出來，掌櫃的算了一算，告訴他要四塊半錢，他把五元票給掌櫃的尋出一件大衣交給他，還找了他五毛大洋。他把大衣披上身，把五毛錢放在袋裏去了。這五毛錢大概是他明天的伙食費吧？</p>
<p>停一刻，一位穿着夾衣的老太婆，冷得抖抖的夾了一件棉襖來當，當得一塊半錢。這位老太婆和她家裏的孩子們是兩天没有吃東西了。餓得不可耐，只好當棉襖買米去餵孩子。但是今晚雖顧了肚子不餓，安知明天不要凍死呢？</p>
<p>這位老太太和她的孩子們是在生存圈邊挣扎，一失脚便要跌到墳墓裏去了！在那生存圈心過舒服生活的人們已否感覺到這人間的不平？</p>

<p>甯陵趙君。佚其名。侏儒而長臂。有大志。喜言兵。讀春秋左氏傳。獨慕養由基。遂習射。能於百步外取人。百不失一。世方崇歐西火器。君視之。蔑如也。嘗得雕弓於古塜。脊有銘。皆蟲書。若可仭曰。生同功。死同雄。三千年。息土中。吁嗟乎弓。君寳之若命。未嘗去左右。或言火器之利。君目上視。大言曰。何足當吾弓。有善火槍者。約共射。君十發十中之。發槍者不及其半。君益自喜。光緒二十年。倭事起。君梜弓慷慨請從軍。大府笑爲迂。不譍。又言攻守之策。亦不報。乃大憤。時遼陽已淪於賊。君潛往。淬毒於矢。日伏叢莽間。狙射賊人。來往飄忽。死以百數十計。竟不知矢所從來。及聞和議割台灣。君益憤伺賊酋曰大山巖者。兩發矢。不中。殪其左右衛。遂被執。不食而死。瀕死猶荷荷呼我弓</p>
<p>外史氏曰。夫當國家危難之際。慷慨赴敵。惟義所適而已。固不必計器械之利。强弱之殊。成敗之數。知義故趙君隻弓。可殲彊冦。不知義。則百萬甲兵。曾不足以守寸土。世之較彊弱器械而計成敗者。皆齷龊忘義庸懦夫也。安有齷龊忘義庸懦夫而可謀國也。而世惟龌龊忘義庸懦</p>

<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>月前日本舉行滿蒙展覽會於東京。所以鼓勵其民衆侵奪我滿蒙之意也。十二月十二日。滬市敎育局開各校愛國活動展覽會。志在警惕學界。思有所奮發救國也。會開三日。最後一日。請東北交通委會委員德國經濟學博士張恪惟演講東北與内地經濟問題。詞多中肯。兹摘要記之於後。</p>
<p>日之實行侵略東北。非起自本年九一八乃始於一九零五年日俄戰爭。東北勢力戰前盡屬俄國。戰後旁落於日。從兹日會昕夕研究東北殖民問題。經營移民東北。奈日民視東北爲畏途。趦趄不前。至今因南滿路直接間接關係。日人遷至者。猶不滿二十萬。足見日之侵華。非爲生存計。爲抱富貴觀念享樂主義計也。證之英國某氏統計益信。彼謂一八八零年與今日之日本。固見其人口日繁。惟生産量遞加之速率。殊倍於人口之增加。日人向世界宣傳。稱以生存逼迫。開拓殖民地。是乃欺人之言。是乃掩耳盜鈴之言也。</p>
<p>日人不願僑居東北。而吾國内地人民樂於彼土。年逾百萬。接踵前往。此蓋天災人禍。實逼處此。斯百萬人之生産。至少可活人四百萬。日無東北仍可生存。中國無東北。殊難度日。東北問題之嚴重性。豈堪勝言。不特此也。吾國國際留易。入超歲達四萬萬兩。東北物産與内地交易相抵。尚餘三萬萬兩。一旦東北非我所有。則合計平時入超數。吾國每年將損失七萬萬兩。中國今日已感四民失業。萬姓憔悴。他日民窮財盡之痛苦。復將增添倍蓰。猶如吾人今日得進三餐苦飯。東北失後。日飯一餐半。亦難保其必獲。是以東北問題乃國家整個問題。願國人思之深思之。</p>
<h3 id="c159">高君珊歐美歸來話國難（一） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>高君珊女士。曾於前年夏。再度游美。人哥侖比亞大學母校。繼續研究敎育二年。今夏離美。赴歐漫游。默察各邦近代敎育事業的新趨勢。當伊初到日内瓦。剛是日本强佔我遼吉兩省。閙得滿城風雨的時候。也正是國際聯盟會形勢最緊張的當兒。高女士蒞會多次。親聆各會員國代表發抒偉論。與我國施總代表折衝樽爼雄壯的精神。所以伊對於國聯的立場。及各國對我東北問題的態度。更深了一層認識。伊最近已歸國了。據說爲了國難。不忍祖國山河的破碎。急於就道。不能依照預定的游歐計劃。引爲一大憾事。日昨適晤記者。即詢以此行所感。承欣然見告。拉雜說來。頗有見地。現在歸納爲三個問題。（一）我國學生應否與聞政治。（二）國聯缺乏平等精神的解剖。（三）我國現時不能立即退出國聯的理由。兹特介紹如次。</p>
<p>美國學生。大都對於政治抱著很冷靜的態度。譬如看報。他們就不甚注意。即使看報也僅限於體育·電影。科學……。而不注意政治新聞。非但中小學生如此。大學生也如此。這是我在哥侖比亞大學的閱報室裏。留心視察所得的結論。大概曾在社會服務過而年長的人。比較的注意政治新聞。女學生喜歡看的。那是更少了。因爲他們對於政治很少興趣。所以不很關心這一項問題。可以說不喜歡看政治消息。就是政治觀念薄弱的表示。他們不但不與聞國内政治。亦甚少留心國際間的問題。在事實上說。美國報紙的言論。絶對自由。論說。紀事。自然是盡量發揮。報紙的權威很大。在例。大家都喜歡看了。而且美國學生並非不愛國。其所以不關心政治。當然有原因在。依我的推測。也許他們因爲國内政治清明。無論内政與外交。都由人民的公僕。丨丨國家的公務人員丨丨負完全責任。人民旣然十分信託。就不必隨時去監督。或者因爲地理上的關係。美國介於大西太平兩洋之間。没有國内的變亂。没有鄰國的侵凌。人民可以安居樂業。學生可以孜孜嚮學。所以政治觀念也就此淡薄了吧。</p>
<p>我一到了歐洲。也以同樣的眼光去觀察過。而各國大學生。顯然不同了。報紙幾乎是人手一份。尤其留心政治消息。我想歐洲各邦。政治的變化較多。而所處的地位。與美國逈然不同。强鄰窺伺。邊防要陲。時常發生糾紛。此種事實。最易激動學生愛國心。所以日常必需的讀物。不容忽視。或者是這個原因吧。假使以我國的學生。與美國學生並論。那就大不相作。我國初中以上的學生。幾乎都注意看報。都留心政治上的消息。越是國家多故。越是要看報紙。越是政治腐敗。越是要與聞政治。譬如現在國難日急。政府應付失策。救國衛民。毫無辦法的時候。學生們再也不能安心讀書。再也不能不傾向於干涉政治之一　。</p>

<p>— 青年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>（二）離上海</p>
<p>蔣主席對我們說過。如今「好男要當兵」了。我就是深深地領會了蔣先。生的指示。所以。一切都不顧。毅然而出征了。</p>
<p>七日上午。我們從感謝上海民衆的歡送呼聲中。在北站步行出發。沿途觀看的人很多。好像看提燈會一樣。不過。有些婦女很悲傷地掉下涙來。</p>
<p>上海義勇軍百多人。一路送我們去到眞茹車站。他們回去時。十分誠懇地向我們致别。他們說。「親愛的青年同志。我們暫時回去了。希望你們站在前線上奮勇地殺滅倭奴。收回東三省。我們不久也跟着你們來了。」當他們說這話時。滿眶子都是眼涙。我們隊裏。十之八九也都嗚咽起來。我的老友錢瑛君。他算是最傷心了。他竟放聲大哭。我勸他道。「大丈夫流血不流涙。何必像婦女一般見識呢。」然而。在這種悲壯的情形之下。的確會使人傷感到極點呵。</p>
<p>在眞茹。我們承曁大同學抗日救國會招待。在科學館住宿。吃飯也是由他們供給。聽說是他們同學向各飯館捐來的。我没有問他們。不知確否。</p>
<p>八日。我們整天在曁大操塲操演軍事訓練。未曾前進。因爲張團長要到上海去拍電致馬將軍。並接洽後方事宜。同時我們幹部也要重行整理。工作很忙。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第四章　大義滅親</p>
<p>二人從虎口中逃生。星夜趕至Ｔ城。這時Ｓ城失守的消息。早已傳遍了城内外。纔知太陽軍已佔領Ｓ城。所有迫擊砲廠飛機廠兵工廠一齊被奪。東北精華。蕩然無存。藉冦兵而齎盜糧。大好金城。拱手讓人。華乃强不覺放聲痛哭。忠淑安慰他道。這些堅甲利器。平日祇供私人利用。本來談不到防禦邊陲的。你哭他做甚。若我國人能痛自悔過。捲土重來。那時踏平三島。何在乎此呢。否則哭也無用了。於是忠淑引導他去見伊的父親彭梅國。報告脫險經過。梅國見愛女平安回來。很是快慰。對於華乃强也稍加禮貎。從此華乃强遂留居在彭梅國邸中。但是太陽軍的軍事行動不絶地報來。佔領Ｙ商埠咧。砲轟公主嶺例。焚掠某處咧。進兵某處咧。飛機擲彈轟炸火車咧。這許多不祥的警耗。一一傳送到華乃强和忠淑耳中。二人的血差不多沸了。太陽軍來的軍隊也不多。怎麽數日之間。大有席捲東北之勢呢。唉。苦來苦去。只苦了許多小民罷了。華乃强對忠淑　說道。Ｔ城扼ＴＡ鐵路衝要。太陽軍狼子野心。得隴望蜀。料他們不久必要來覬觎這裏的。不知尊大人運籌帷幄。坐鎭一方。萬一他們前來。究竟籌有何種辦法抵抗呢。還是不抵抗。忠淑聽了。眉頭一皺。說道。乃强兄。說也慚愧。我父親平素　頇無能。况且年紀已老。醉心利祿。沉酗聲色。那裏有廉頗之勇。馬援之志。手下雖有一萬餘軍隊。都是灞上棘門之軍。缺乏戰鬭力。焉知愛國愛民。近日我父親雖也聚集了幾個軍官。天天在密室討論。不知他們有何方法。據我看來。防禦上一些没有工程。太陽軍來如何抵敵。我向他問問。他總說軍國大事。無關兒女子事。保你平安無恙。說起了眞是可恨。華乃强不由嘆口氣道。那麽我居留此間。也很無意味。在昔班超投軍從軍。三十六人深入虎穴。斬各王頭。立不世功。我今空有一腔黨國熱忱。到那裏去効力呢。這時忠淑眼眶子裏隱隱有眼涙滴出來了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Students from Various Provinces and Cities Held a General Demonstration in Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Party Headquarters Surrounded, Traffic Cut Off</p>
<p>The Entire "Central Daily News" Was Smashed</p>
<p>One Student from Shanghai Died from Severe Injuries</p>
<p>Over Sixty Students Arrested</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Yesterday at 11 AM, over 5,000 students from Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), Anhui, and other places marched from Zhongda (Central University) to stage a general demonstration. Each student held a small flag, some held wooden sticks, shouting slogans along the way, and distributing leaflets. At 12:30 PM, they arrived at the Central Party Headquarters. The Party Headquarters had received the news and tightly closed the iron gates, and added many military police to guard outside the gates. After the students arrived, they could not enter, so they shouted various slogans outside the gate. Some students attempted to break in without success, so they used bricks and stones to completely destroy the party emblem affixed to the gate of the Party Headquarters, as well as the reception room, guard room, and the glass windows of the nearby road. A wooden archway on the east side of the Party Headquarters was also destroyed. At that time, due to the large number of students, the Party Headquarters was surrounded by students, and traffic was almost completely cut off. The stalemate continued until 2 PM without any results, and the students began to leave the Party Headquarters in formation. During the disturbance, students captured three policemen and Party Headquarters staff members outside the Party Headquarters. One staff member was sent back in the afternoon. The remaining two are reportedly still detained at Zhongda. According to sources at the Party Headquarters, about a dozen staff members were captured by the students. However, student sources said that several students were arrested by the military police at that time, and several were injured. When asked about this, people at the Party Headquarters said that there was no such thing. Currently, a large number of military police are still stationed at the Party Headquarters, and the gates are heavily guarded. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Over 10,000 students from various provinces and cities departed from Zhongda yesterday afternoon to stage a general demonstration. When they arrived at the Central Party Headquarters, the Party Headquarters had received prior notice and took strict precautions, closing the main gate. At that time, students attempted to enter through the side gate, resulting in a conflict with the military police guarding the gate. The reception room and guard room of the Party Headquarters were destroyed. Currently, the side gate of the Party Headquarters is also tightly closed. All the students are still determined to enter and have surrounded the Party Headquarters, cutting off traffic. As of the time of dispatch, the situation has not been resolved. During the disturbance, one guard was abducted by the students. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Today at 2:30 PM, the demonstration group divided into twelve teams, with the Fudan team leading, followed by the Southeast, Jiangsu North, and other teams. At 3:00 PM, they arrived at the gate of the "Central Daily News". A team of unarmed military police was stationed inside the gate, which was tightly closed. The crowd smashed the "Recruiting Enlistment Land" plaque and destroyed the glass windows. Some jumped in through the window openings. Someone with a megaphone shouted, "Charge in!" More than 200 people entered and completely smashed the newspaper office. Dozens of people did the smashing and then came out, but the second batch of students went in again. One guard was injured in the hand. Later, a team of soldiers holding wooden sticks shouted and rushed to the entrance of the newspaper office. At the same time, a row of soldiers carrying guns fired into the air. At that time, the student commander with the megaphone fled first, and the students outside the gate followed and scattered in all directions. As a result, the students inside the newspaper office were like turtles in a jar, and were arrested one by one. Seven people jumped out of the back window to the riverbank. Two fell into the river and were rescued by Shandong neighbors who went into the river, but they were frozen stiff and on the verge of death, and were taken away for treatment by a doctor from a certain hospital. One person who was shocked and fell in is still missing. Furthermore, Yang Xiangheng, a student from the Shanghai Wensheng English College, had knife wounds on his head and chest. He fell into the river and was carried back to Zhongda, but was refused admission by the provincial hospital. He died immediately upon returning to school. It is estimated that about 35 students were beaten and arrested in the newspaper office. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Student sources claim that the exact number of deaths in front of the "Central Daily News" today is unknown, but over 30 people were seriously injured and went to the hospital for treatment. About 100 were arrested. Also, after the disturbance, a Shanghai Dongya Sports College female rescue team of over 30 people, holding Red Cross flags, departed from Zhongda. When they were escorting people to Hai Bridge in front of the "Central Daily News", they were stopped by guards who fired multiple shots into the air. They then turned back to Zhongda. Currently, the students have sent four representatives to meet with Acting Chairman of the Government, Lin Sen, to make demands. Because Lin was not at his private residence, the representatives are still waiting. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Tonight, the Garrison Command invited reporters to a meeting, hosted by Fang Zhi and Luo Chunyou, secretaries of the Central Party Headquarters, and Lai Lian of the "Central Daily News", to report on the communist slogans in the demonstration group. Then, Deng Shizeng, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, reported that while students petitioning was patriotic, a small number of communists were taking advantage of the situation to incite riots, which should be stopped. Currently, the international community has a very pessimistic view of our country due to the recent student incidents, which has greatly affected our international standing. A certain minister even expressed alarm over the disorder in a phone call. The government feels that the youth movement has gone beyond the norm and cannot be tolerated any longer. From tomorrow onwards, demonstration activities will not be allowed. We hope that newspapers will guide well-meaning young people back on the right path. People at the Party Headquarters said that one party member was abducted by students and is missing. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Chen Mingshu, the Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, hosted reporters at his headquarters at 10 PM on the 17th, to explain the details of the incidents that occurred in Beijing today involving the demonstration groups from various schools. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Yang Xiangheng, the student who died today, was a second-year student at the Shanghai Wensheng English College, from Puguangchang, Xuanhan County, Sichuan. He was 25 years old and had parents, siblings, and a wife. One account says that he was first stabbed in the head and chest with a bayonet, and then thrown into the river to drown. Another account says that he fell into the water and died accidentally when the military police dispersed the students. His body is currently at Zhongda. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) After the demonstration group left the Central Party Headquarters today, they went to Baotai Street, where a vehicle of the Executive Yuan, number 358, was destroyed. Next, they went to the National Government to demonstrate. Because the National Government had closed the iron gates in advance, the students could not enter and dispersed after shouting slogans. Currently, dozens of unarmed guards are stationed in front of the National Government, and security is very tight. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) As of 11 PM on the 17th, a total of over 60 demonstrators had been arrested. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) The Jinan student demonstration group did not participate in the general demonstration on the 17th and withdrew temporarily. The delegation is scheduled to return to Jinan on the 18th. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Today, in front of the Central Party Headquarters, students did not allow reporters to enter the inner circle to inquire about the real situation. At the "Central Daily News", military police blocked the alleys and did not allow entry. Therefore, the extent of the internal damage is not yet fully understood. Only what was directly seen and heard by neighbors on the left and right is recorded. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) After the Beijing student demonstration group stormed the Central Party Headquarters, a portion of about 400-500 people went to the Examination Yuan at about 1 PM. They intended to storm the Examination Yuan. The Examination Yuan had prior knowledge and sent 40-50 unarmed police to guard the main gate. The students did not break in due to the tight security. They shouted slogans wildly. At that time, Zhang Yi-kuan, a clerk in the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs, was returning to the Yuan in a rickshaw from outside. As he was approaching the main gate, he was dragged down. Also, when the group arrived at the consumer cooperative of Central Party Headquarters staff in Baiziting, they used wooden sticks and stones to smash all the glass and utensils. (Special Dispatch, Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) When the demonstration group surrounded the Central Party Headquarters today, the headquarters happened to be behind the French Consul General's office. Minister Werther happened to be at the consulate. Counselor Händel went to the front of the Party Headquarters to investigate. A student asked if he was an imperialist. Händel replied, "I am a Republican." The crowd applauded. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Guangdong Members Arrive in Beijing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>Jiang Also Visits the Ministry of Railways That Evening to Return the Visit</p>
<p>Glimpses of Future Ministerial Candidates</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) The special train carrying the Guangdong representatives arrived at Xiaguan Station at 3:40 PM on the 17th. Banners welcoming Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and Chen Youren and other comrades to Beijing to jointly address the national crisis and promote a national salvation conference were hung inside and outside the station platform. Jiang Jieshi sent He Yingqin as his representative to welcome them at the station. Acting Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan Chen Mingshu, and Yu Youren, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, Lian Sheng Hai, Enhe Batu, Ke Xing'e, and other representatives from the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union, and important officials from the Ministry of Railways, about 600-700 people, welcomed them at the station amidst military music. Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, Chen Youren, and others shook hands with the welcoming people on the platform through the train windows. Lin Sen, Chen Mingshu, He Yingqin, Yu Youren, and others boarded the train and exchanged greetings with Sun Ke and Wu Chaoshu for the longest time. Gu Mengyu, Chen Bijun, Gan Naiguang, Bai Yunti, Chen Gongbo, Zeng Zhongming, Zhu Pu, Liang Hancao, Chen Jianru, and others who came with them also shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with the welcoming people. He Yaozu came with them and got off the train at 4 o'clock. At this time, applause thundered inside and outside the station. People's representatives shouted slogans such as "Implement Revolutionary Diplomacy Vigorously," "Implement Democratic Politics," and "Welcome Central Committee Members to Beijing to Jointly Address the National Crisis." They then took the prepared cars and sped away. Crowds of onlookers lined the streets. Sun Ke stayed at the old official residence of the Ministry of Railways, and the other representatives and central committee members stayed at the Overseas Chinese Hotel, Lizhi Society, Central Hotel, and other places. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Sun Ke and others issued a joint statement on the train, saying, "Our only task in coming to Beijing this time is to prepare for the convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee to implement the various resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference. The Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee is a major turning point for our country's politics to abandon the old and embrace the new. Only by implementing the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference can we seek a new way out for future politics. This point should be very clear to everyone. As for the current diplomatic issues, we and our colleagues have repeatedly declared that we must use the spirit of not ceding sovereignty or humiliating the country and the perseverance to achieve the goal of restoring territorial sovereignty in order to live up to the expectations of the people. This is our duty. By coming to Beijing this time, we will have the opportunity to more clearly understand the contents of the Northeast Incident. After the establishment of a unified government, we and our colleagues believe that we will be able to respect the people and work together with them to promote the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy and choose revolutionary diplomatic strategies to restore the territorial sovereignty of the three northeastern provinces. When it is absolutely necessary, we and our colleagues believe that the new government will also make the greatest determination to never fail the expectations of the people. As for the loss of the three northeastern provinces this time, all military and political authorities who were directly responsible for defending the territory should bear the responsibility and be judged by the people." (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Sun Ke and his party left the station amidst military music and took cars to the Minister of Railways' residence for a short rest. Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Zou Lu, Chen Youren, and Li Wenfan all rested briefly at Sun's old official residence in the Ministry of Railways. Later, accompanied by Lin Sen, Chen Mingshu, and Wu Tiecheng, they went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects. After performing the ceremony, the master of ceremonies opened the curtain to allow a public viewing of the President's remains. After exiting, they drove together to Jiang Jieshi's residence at the Central Military Academy to pay a visit. Yu Youren, He Yingqin, He Yaozu, and others had already arrived at Jiang's residence to wait. Jiang welcomed them at the door and shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. They went to the reception room together. Sun and others first expressed their condolences to Jiang and exchanged heartfelt greetings. Jiang also inquired in detail about Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei's conditions. Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and others replied on their behalf. They briefly discussed the important issues of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee and left at 6:30 PM. A public banquet was held at the Ministry of Railways that evening. Jiang also went to the Ministry of Railways at 9 o'clock to return the visit to Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, and others to fulfill the friendship. According to Sun Ke's words to reporters at the station, his primary task this time is to prepare for the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. If the members from Guangdong cannot arrive by the 21st, a preparatory meeting will be held first. Mr. Wang Jingwei is expected to be able to come to Beijing before the 21st to attend, despite his illness. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) Today, 14 central committee members came from Shanghai, including Sun Ke, a member of the first, second, and third central committees; Wu Chaoshu and Chu Minyi, members of the second and third central committees; Zou Lu, a member of the first central committee; Chen Youren, Chen Bijun, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Gan Naiguang, and Bai Yunti, members of the second central committee; Li Wenfan, a member of the third central committee; Zeng Zhongming and Liang Hancao, members of the fourth central committee elected in Hong Kong; and Tang Shengzhi, a member of the fourth central committee elected in Shanghai. It is expected that Wu Chaoshu will be appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but Wu declined. Guangdong has decided to appoint Chen Youren as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Fu Bingchang as the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is planned to have Wu Chaoshu return to Guangdong to serve as the Chairman. Wu told people that he will return to Guangdong as soon as the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee is closed. It is expected that Wang Jingwei will be appointed as the Chairman of the National Government, but Wang strongly declined. Guangdong still recommends Tang Shaoyi. Both sides are still in negotiations. It is hoped that Song Ziwen will remain as the Minister of Finance because Guangdong has never nominated a candidate. The previous rumor of Liu Jiwen is not accurate. The Shanghai business community hopes that a banker will serve as the Deputy Minister of Finance so that business people can participate in national finance. This proposal has been accepted by both Nanjing and Guangdong. Therefore, the Deputy Minister of Finance after the government reorganization will belong to a banker who is currently a member of the Economic Committee. Opinions are currently being sought.

<p>Ministry of the Army Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) Army Minister Araki proposed to the Cabinet meeting today to increase troops in Manchuria and requested approval. As a result, it was decided to dispatch a certain division from the mainland to Manchuria to replace the division stationed in Manchuria and Korea, and to send another unit to Tianjin. (Special Dispatch, Japanese Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The various regiments of the First Division in Azabu, Akasaka, Zaikura, and Kofu left by train at 8:20 this morning to Manchuria to assist the independent garrison. (Special Dispatch, Japanese Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) Today's special cabinet meeting decided on the troop dispatch expenses for Manchuria and Tianjin as follows: from the second reserve fund, 1.76 million yen will be spent for increasing troops in Manchuria and 400,000 yen will be spent for dispatching troops to Tianjin, totaling 2.16 million yen. (Special Dispatch, Japanese Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The Japanese Ministry of the Army issued the following statement today: "Currently, the weather in Manchuria is severely cold, the tasks of the various units are heavy, and bandits are rampant, becoming increasingly rampant. As a result, the current strength of the entire Kwantung Army (including the Korean Brigade) is not enough to maintain the security of Manchuria and ensure the safety of the lives and property of imperial subjects. Therefore, it is currently urgent to supplement the rear organization and have some maneuvering capabilities. Previously, we ordered the Korean dispatch unit to postpone its return, but in order to strengthen the defense of Korea, we should order it to return as soon as possible. Therefore, we are currently planning to dispatch a force from the Japanese mainland (drawn from the 12th Division) and some special forces (drawn from the Konoe 1st and 11th Divisions) with roughly the same numbers. After their arrival, we will consider the situation and immediately order the Korean dispatch army to return to its original defense. When the incident occurred in Tianjin, we urgently dispatched a portion of the Kwantung Army to the Tianjin area. However, the situation in that area is not only still unstable, but also the dramatic changes in the situation are difficult to predict. Therefore, in order to hope to protect the expatriates completely and to replace the Kwantung Army dispatched units, we plan to dispatch one unit (drawn from the 5th Division) to the smallest extent possible." (Special Dispatch, Japanese Union News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The Japanese cabinet today approved the continued dispatch of a Japanese mixed brigade to the Kwantung Leased Territory to replace the Japanese troops in Manchuria. It is expected that the Japanese brigade transferred from Korea on September 19 will be withdrawn. Six battalions of Japanese railway guards in Manchuria have suffered casualties. About 100 people have been selected to fill the vacancies. This morning, these people departed from Tokyo. Thousands of people watched and cheered near the station. (Special Dispatch, Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The cabinet decided to send a mixed brigade to Manchuria, and send two Japanese battalions to Tianjin. At the same time, the order to withdraw the Japanese battalion that went to Tianjin from Dalian on November 21 will be issued. It is said that after this mixed brigade arrives in Manchuria, one brigade originally stationed in Korea will be transferred back to its original defense in Korea. Therefore, after this troop deployment, the strength of the Japanese army in Manchuria will be the same as it is now, a total of 20,000 people, i.e., the original garrison plus two mixed brigades.

<p>(Geneva Dispatch) China today reported to the League of Nations Council the recent hostile actions of the Japanese in the three northeastern provinces in violation of treaties and promises. The report stated that on the 5th of this month, a Japanese warship carrying 80 soldiers arrived at Qinhuangdao. On the 9th, three Japanese military aircraft dropped bombs on Daxing Bridge. On the same day, two other aircraft dropped bombs on Tian County (transliteration) and opened fire with machine guns. On the 11th, Japanese aircraft circled in the sky above the Jinzhou provincial government. On the same day, they also flew to Yixian and Huludao, circling for a long time. Japanese military police also detained injured Chinese passengers at Xinmin Station for questioning. It also stated that the Japanese had merged the Jichang and Jidun railways into one, arbitrarily established the Changdun Railway Administration, and sent a survey team to extend the railway west to Daliai and east to Huining. The Tokyo government had assured the League of Nations that it would not allow the Japanese situation to become more serious. Now that it has taken these actions, please pay attention to the Council. Currently, people in the League of Nations attach great importance to Japan's activities in the railway sector, believing that its motive is to develop the railways that are strategically important to occupy the entire three northeastern provinces militarily in order to facilitate Japanese aggression. This note will be forwarded by the League of Nations Secretariat to all council members. (National Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Bureaucratic Politics and Expert Politics <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The corruption of our country's politics has reached its extreme today. We say this not with a tinted lens, nor to make harsh criticisms to blame the political system or form of government. The English poet Pope once said, "For forms of government let fools contest; Whate'er is best administer'd is best." Therefore, what we wish to discuss today is not the political system or the form of politics, but to ask about the government and its administration. As for today's politics, we can summarize it in one sentence: "Bureaucratic politics." There is a common saying, "political stage." This describes politics as a drama, with changing situations and myriad transformations. Those engaged in politics are like characters on the stage, with unpredictable emotions. However, today's politics in our country is not only a stage, but a stagnant pool of water. Those engaged in so-called politics are not only characters in a play, but maggots breeding in a stagnant pool. Of course, there are exceptions, but looking around, we cannot deny or hide the phenomenon of countless people swarming and gathering in this stagnant pool.</p>
<p>Today's politicians rely on power rather than ability, on cunning rather than integrity. The greater the power and the more cunning, the higher the position and the more dazzling the influence. As a result, those who seek favors fill their doors, those who flatter their faces, those who cater to their will, and those who encourage their evil, make them see themselves as lofty and isolated from the people. Those with slightly less power hold slightly less important positions, and those with even less power hold even less important positions. As for whether they have the ability to govern or the talent to govern, whether their talents match their positions or their positions allow them to fully utilize their talents, no one asks, and certainly no commoner dares to ask. Thus, everyone sees "becoming an official" as a shortcut to "getting rich," and everyone sees despicable flattery as a path to seeking office, attaching themselves to power and influence, behaving like slaves, and using every means possible to scramble for position. They are anxious about gains and losses, and they engage in exclusion and infighting to the extreme. Therefore, those who secretly occupy important positions are all old friends of the powerful, and those who solemnly govern the people are all relatives and friends of the powerful. Some even hold multiple positions simultaneously and remotely hold empty titles, as if they are the only ones capable in the world. As a result, no official is not corrupt, and no official does not exploit the people. The more prosperous the officials become, the poorer the people become. The more the officials live in luxury, the more the people wander and suffer, with nowhere to die. Those engaged in politics only see politics as a job and a way of life, and they do not ask about what politics or governance mean. Therefore, bandits are as numerous as hairs, internal strife is continuous, foreign troubles are pressing, and the people are in dire straits, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. The political history of the last twenty years is filled with blood, filth, baseness, depravity, the flaunting of power, insidious infighting, and the struggle for poison. Is it an exaggeration to call it bureaucratic politics?</p>
<p>However, what we have said is an undeniable fact. Only the brave can admit the true facts, and only the brave can accept the lessons of the facts and seek a way out. Today, the situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and politics has a chance for rebirth. Therefore, those engaged in politics today must make immense efforts and have immense determination to turn death into life and cleanse this stagnant pool. Everything must start anew.</p>
<p>What is the way to cleanse it? It is that those engaged in politics must be experts. A country is like a machine. The machine is useful for being used and for being used properly, creating benefits for the public. However, to ensure that the machine can be used and used beneficially, its entire mechanism must be extremely sound and capable of being used. If gears are used as engines and belts are used as axles, if materials are not used properly and use is not made of materials, then the machine's function will be stagnant and it will become waste. Politics is the same. Those engaged in politics should each have their own expertise and responsibilities. Talent must be used for the country, and the country must use its talent. Only then can those engaged in politics fulfill their duties and utilize their abilities, so that all administrative affairs can be handled well and the country's function can be flexible and unimpeded. If those who are skilled in education are put in charge of industry, those who are skilled in science are put in charge of diplomacy, those who are skilled in military affairs are put in charge of civil affairs, or if, even worse, those who have no skills or abilities are privately given important political responsibilities to repay favors and reward merits, then all actions and measures will be abnormal, like a stroke, and how can politics not be chaotic and the country's lifeline and people's lives not increasingly approach ruin? Therefore, at this excellent opportunity for rebirth and resurrection, we deeply hope that Party and government leaders can make immense efforts and have immense determination to destroy the foundation of bureaucratic politics, vigorously implement expert politics, and be careful not to let future generations look at today as we look at the past, only to leave people sighing and grieving endlessly.</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang's Telegram to Jiang</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Zhang Xueliang resigned as Deputy Commander, the Central Government appointed Zhang as the Director of the Beiping Pacification Office, with the pacification area including the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Rehe, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Zhang felt that the responsibility was too heavy and he was afraid that he would not be able to handle it. He proposed, as Li Shizeng had discussed, to establish another political branch in the North so that the heavy responsibilities in the North could be shared by everyone. It is heard that the Central Government considers this plan appropriate and will submit it for discussion at the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The number of candidates for the council is expected to be very large. (Seventeenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Deputy Commander's Office will be abolished, and the organizational methods of the Pacification Headquarters will be determined by the Central Government. It is rumored that the organization will be largely the same as that of the Deputy Commander's Office, and many of the personnel will remain the same. (Seventeenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed to Nanjing on the 15th, saying, "Respected Chairman Jiang, since the Shenyang Incident, you have been anxious above, and the whole country has been clamoring below. Domestic and foreign affairs are in chaos. Almost three months have passed, and the disputes are still unresolved. I failed to defend the territory and suffered this calamity. Even dying ten thousand times would not atone for my guilt. The Central Government has been lenient about the past and entrusted me with future responsibilities. I have endured and tried to make amends, hoping to return to the nation after the invaded territories have been fully recovered and confess my guilt. Unexpectedly, long-standing flaws have accumulated, and obstacles have arisen one after another. All my plans have been thwarted. This is because I lack the sincerity to move people and the steadfastness to manage affairs. At this time when the country is facing great difficulties, how can a local commander be allowed to hold a position without contributing? Because of me, the border affairs are deteriorating, and the national prestige is declining. Even if I were executed in the marketplace, what good would it do for the country? I watch helplessly as the rivers and mountains are lost and recall the difficulties of the predecessors' creation. My soul deeply regrets it. I am in a state of confusion (This sentence is missing in the telegraph code). Resigning is my only option today. I do this not to shirk responsibility. Since childhood, I have learned etiquette in the family, and later I have served the Party. I will spare no effort for the country. Although the command of the army is gone, my ambition to volunteer has not ended. As a citizen and a member of the Party, I will abide by all decisions regarding life, death, advance, and retreat. This is my firm statement, and I dare not deceive my heart. I hope that the Chairman will issue a grand decree to resolutely strip me of my position as Deputy Commander and give the world a new look, so that achievements can be gathered through renewal, and words can be acted upon even if they come from a fallen person. In this time of survival and crisis, the turning point lies in one move. I am filled with fear and await orders. Zhang Xueliang kowtows." (Seventeenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

The colleagues of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government held a tea party at the Provincial Government at 4:00 p.m. on the 17th to bid farewell to former Chairman Ye Chucang. Ye, as well as the two members Luo Liangjian and Li Mingyang, and all the staff attended. The Secretary-General, Jin Tigan, delivered a speech, saying that he had been deeply influenced by the Chairman in the past two years. Although Ye has resigned from Jiangsu politics, he will still be responsible for the canal project as a citizen of Jiangsu. This spirit is a great contribution to politics. Ye then gave a reply of thanks, saying that he had achieved nothing in the past two years, but had not made any major mistakes. Ye's freedom from moral and legal sanctions was entirely due to the assistance of his colleagues. It is said that those who excel in learning should become officials, but I have become an official without excelling in learning, which is a fundamental error in governance. He hoped that everyone would have sufficient cultivation to avoid misleading themselves and others. The former Director of Civil Affairs, Hu Puan, and the Director of Construction, Shen Baixian, have both resigned and returned to Shanghai and Beijing. (Seventeenth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Under Consideration by the British Government</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, London, 17th - The Daily Express reported this morning that the British government is currently considering suspending the British naval shipbuilding program. Except for warships needed to counter submarines, it is proposed to suspend all construction. A small cabinet committee is currently discussing this issue. If a decision is made to suspend construction, it will be temporary and will depend on the progress of the disarmament conference in February next year. If Britain temporarily suspends shipbuilding, the British representatives attending the disarmament conference will have a strong tool to urge the reduction of European land and air forces. If the outcome of this conference is satisfactory, Britain's temporary suspension can be changed to a long-term suspension. Furthermore, if Britain's shipbuilding program is suspended, it will not only be effective at the disarmament conference but also save Britain millions of pounds. It is said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain strongly supports this proposal. The shipbuilding program announced last March, which requires work to begin in February, includes two 7,000-ton armored cruisers, one 5,000-ton armored cruiser, one destroyer flotilla leader, eight destroyers, four troop transports, one gunboat, and two auxiliary ships.</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, London, 17th - The naval news reported in the Daily Express this morning has been firmly denied by the authorities and is dismissed as fantasy. The cabinet has so far only been able to touch on the fringes of the disarmament issue. Disarmament is indeed one of the issues being discussed by a small cabinet committee, but it is said that even the outline of the plan has not yet been prepared.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury, appearing before the Senate Finance Committee, stated frankly that President Hoover's government is actually opposed to the cancellation of war debts, thus sparking a heated debate with those opposing and supporting Hoover each taking their own stance. At the same time, Republican Congressman McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, criticized President Hoover, saying that Hoover and Treasury officials openly announced their opposition to the cancellation of war debts on the one hand, and secretly cooperated with debt groups on the other in an attempt to reduce the total amount of war debts. President Hoover's negotiation of a moratorium on war debt payments violated his oath of office. Republican Congressman Treadway and others strongly criticized McFadden's remarks as inappropriate. Although the moratorium on war debt payments may eventually be ratified by Congress, it has not yet been done. A total of US$122.5 million in debt owed by foreign countries to the United States is due on Tuesday. The US State Department and Treasury Department have not collected it due to prior agreements. President Hoover has now asked Congress to approve the payment of the amount owed to the United States during the moratorium period in ten years, starting on July 31, 1933.</p>
<p>▲National Press, Washington, 16th - The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a very important foreign policy resolution today.

The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee also decided to submit it for discussion by the committee after Congress reconvenes after the Christmas and New Year holidays in preparation for public discussion by the Senate. The discussion also includes the issue of the United States joining the Hague Permanent Court. Borah announced publicly today that he would continue to work to restore diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. It is claimed that the world economy cannot be brought into order unless the Russian problem is resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Taiyuan Student Petition Wave Subsided <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲Rong Honglu Acts as Mediator, Provides Satisfactory Reply</p>
<p>▲Normal School Experiences Expulsion of Principal Incident</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: All students of the Shanxi Provincial Student Anti-Japanese Federation went to the provincial government on the 11th to petition, and a conflict occurred due to a misunderstanding, destroying the doors and windows of the provincial government and belongings, as well as the residence of Miao Peicheng, the director of the education department, etc. Afterwards, the student side sent a letter to Chairman Xu that evening, expressing their apology. Yesterday (12th), all students of the Student Federation, except for those schools that had withdrawn from the event, gathered at the Provincial Confucius Temple at 9:00 AM to continue discussing the petition matters. At the same time, dozens of representatives were sent to the Army Fourth School Alumni Association to ask for a reply from Garrison Commander Rong Honglu. Rong went as scheduled and replied to the student representatives, saying, "Representatives and all students, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, are conducting a patriotic movement, which I admire very much. However, regarding the damage to the doors, windows, and belongings of the provincial government and education department yesterday, I feel ashamed and distressed because I have the responsibility to maintain law and order. I hope the representatives will tell the students that they should consider my responsibilities and also consider the country and society. As for the representatives going to Beijing to petition, I also very much agree, but the provincial government is unable to approve it due to the explicit order from the central government. If you are willing to go to Beijing, you can first submit the list of names of those going to Beijing, and I will find a way to plan travel expenses for you in a private capacity. As for the guarantee of the youth movement, the provincial government will of course agree, but within the scope that does not interfere with social order. As for the winter vacation, the Ministry of Education has regulations. If you think it is necessary to extend the vacation to conduct extensive propaganda, you should plan it yourself. Regarding the issuance of firearms, whenever you practice drills, you can borrow the number of guns used by the soldiers, and after the drills, the soldiers will take them back for their own use. As for the expenses of the Anti-Japanese Association, it is difficult for the provincial government to issue them because it involves the budget, and the students should handle it themselves in their respective schools. In short, the provincial government's committees fully support the students' patriotic enthusiasm and hope that this unfortunate incident will not happen again," and so on. The representatives felt satisfied and continued to discuss the amount of travel expenses, etc., and the maximum number of people going to Beijing to petition. After discussion, the maximum number of people should not exceed 90. Afterwards, a representative from the Normal School spoke, asking Rong to withdraw all the troops sent to the Normal School to suppress them. Rong replied that he would never interfere if the order was not disrupted. At 2:00 PM, the representatives returned to the Confucius Temple and reported the details to all the students, and prepared everything for going to Beijing. Students from various schools in the city went to the provincial government the day before to assist the petition representatives. After the students of the Normal School learned of this news, the Anti-Japanese Association of the school requested the principal to convene a general meeting to report the representatives' hunger strike. At that time, the director of student affairs of the school said that young people only need to have patriotic enthusiasm, but must not have patriotic actions, and he absolutely forbade students to gather within the scope of his duties as principal. After repeated negotiations by the student representatives, they were finally rejected. The students then gathered in the courtyard and set off in formation to the provincial government to petition and comfort the petition representatives. When they arrived at the provincial government, a representative was sent to meet them by the petition delegation, saying that the chairman was not present, and the chairman and Commander Rong had also promised a considerable reply to the matter. After the students of the school returned to school, they were very dissatisfied with Principal Liang Xianda's obstruction of the students' patriotic movement. All the students held a meeting in the courtyard, and after discussion, unanimously advocated expelling the principal from the school. Representatives from each class were elected to hold a meeting. At this time, the principal and director of student affairs had already left the school. At about 9:00 PM, troops dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters went to the school to suppress the students. Yesterday morning, the students set off from the back door, returned from the provincial government to the Confucius Temple, and requested assistance from the Student Federation. At about 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the petition delegation of the Student Federation sent a representative to report to the Confucius Temple that Commander Rong had replied that he would guarantee the return of the students of the Normal School to the school and ordered the military and police at the school not to interfere with the students' patriotic movement, but would not withdraw the troops for the time being. The students of the Normal School then obeyed the order and returned to school. (December 13)</p>

<p>▲More Than Two Thousand Students Gather in Yanzhou</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: More than two thousand male and female students from middle schools and above in Jinan City went to Beijing to petition for diplomatic issues and have not yet returned north. Students from various places will also have the same actions. Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Shandong Province, such as Taian Third Middle School, County Normal School, Yanzhou Third Vocational School, County Normal School, Qufu Second Normal School, Jining Seventh Middle School, and Caozhou Sixth Middle School, etc., it has now been agreed to gather in Yanzhou tomorrow (16th). It is said that there are more than two thousand people in total, waiting for trains to enter Beijing to petition the National Government. After the Tianjin-Pukou Railway received this news, this afternoon, Fang Bolin, the chief of the railway transport section, went to the provincial government and asked Han Fuqu for instructions on what to do if students forcibly detained vehicles in Yanzhou to enter Beijing to petition. Han did not express whether it was possible. Since the students have decided to enter Beijing to petition, they will inevitably detain vehicles after gathering in Yanzhou. Tomorrow night or early the day after tomorrow, they will continue to enter Beijing. As for Qingdao, in addition to Qingdao University, which has already petitioned in Beijing and returned to Qingdao, other railway middle schools, municipal middle schools, and municipal girls' middle schools are also preparing to go to Beijing to petition. The principals of these schools are trying to dissuade them. Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, arrived in Jinan today to meet Han Fuqu and discuss whether or not to allow students to board the trains, but the results have not yet been heard. In addition, there is also a saying that the Qingzhou Fourth Normal School will also take similar action. (December 15)</p>

Even the party headquarters expenses have not been approved despite repeated requests, given the exhausted state of the district funds. Without rice, even the cleverest cook cannot make a meal. As a last resort, in addition to sending a telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs, they specially jointly submitted a request to the county government yesterday, asking for permission to resign and select capable personnel to replace them in order to emphasize autonomy.

<p>The Yingchang Labor Dispute Declared Resolved The labor dispute at the Yingchang Firecracker Factory in Zhenjiang has been resolved after the county government and party headquarters convened both parties for mediation. However, they were not satisfied with the compensation for the dismissed workers. Yesterday, the county government and party headquarters convened both labor and management again to hold mediation. The management compensated the ten dismissed workers with fifty yuan each, provided that the subsequent dismissal of workers due to misconduct should not be taken as an example. Both parties handled the matter in accordance with legal procedures. At that time, neither party had any objections, and this incident completely came to an end.</p>

<p>Investigation Reveals Japanese Clock, Penalty of Standing in a Wooden Cage Not Completed The Huaiyin Anti-Japanese Association previously discovered that Da Zhonghua Clock Shop was selling Japanese wooden clocks, and the penalty of standing in a wooden cage was not completed as a warning. Not many days later, Yi Fengming, a member of the association's executive committee, discovered four Japanese clocks in Fang Yongmao Clock Shop on the street yesterday (the 7th) afternoon. Because the prohibition was added, there was a conflict with the shop owner, Fang Weihan. The policeman on duty, Xu Zhengjia, stepped forward to deal with it, but to no avail. He took Executive Committee Member Yi to a sub-station and asked Patrol Officer Wu to handle it. Wu knew it was Yi, so he reprimanded the policeman and asked Yi to return to the association. At this time, He Zhousheng, the county magistrate of Huaiyin, also received a report from Yu Di, the standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association, and ordered Zhang Yaosong, the acting director of the Public Security Bureau, to handle it properly. Acting Director Zhang and Patrol Officer Wu took Fang Yongmao, the shop owner of Fang Yongmao Clock Shop, to the Anti-Japanese Association yesterday (the 8th) morning to negotiate. As a result, Fang Weihan was ordered to issue a note stating that the four Japanese clocks would be sealed by the shop itself and no longer sold, and then followed the Director of Public Security back to the shop to await handling. Today (the 9th), the Anti-Japanese Association planned to punish Fang Weihan by standing in a wooden cage and take two photos for the association to keep on file. In the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to summon Fang to the association. However, before the event, Fang Weihan's uncle, Fang Dianchen, and others knew things were not good and gathered many men and women to wait near the wooden cage in the Caoshikou entrance. When they saw their nephew Weihan being escorted there, they tore down the wooden cage without saying a word, then shouted grievances along the street and went to the 25th Route Headquarters outside the city to appeal for help. The headquarters was inconvenient to interfere, so they sent the Fangs to the county government for handling. County Magistrate He gave a brief lecture and released Fang Weihan. The storm ended.</p>

<h3 id="e81">The Three Principles of the People and University Education Zheng Hongnian <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>I. General Remarks</p>
<p>The late Premier once said that "the foundation of revolution is built on profound learning." In other words, "revolution must have learning, and learning must also be revolutionary." The purpose of revolution is construction, and the first priority of construction is talent. The university is the cultural source and the place to cultivate talents. It should gather thousands of thoughts and create all things. It has the name of a school, and all the knowledge of the school cannot overflow the scope of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People are the collective crystallization of all the world's knowledge and the scale of all things. All social sciences, natural sciences, philosophy, literature, etc., related to politics, economics, and culture are subordinate to the separate and interconnected effects of the three principles of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. If we want to fulfill the late Premier's legacy and earnestly promote the Three Principles of the People, then any academic field cannot do without it. May I ask, what kind of academic field is still left in the world outside the scope of the Premier's Three Principles of the People? Therefore, today's university education, known as the highest institution, only seeks to cultivate elites in the Three Principles of the People, to understand and apply them, in order to complete its mission. And today's revolutionary youth, the most promising university students in society, only seek to choose a kind of knowledge in the Three Principles of the People, to concentrate and devote themselves to it, in order to become useful talents.</p>
<p>II. The Spirit of the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>(I) Systematizing the Old and the New The late Premier's forty years of revolutionary experience tell us to restore the inherent national spirit and self-confidence; to take the political principles of sincerity, righteousness, cultivation, family governance, and peace of the world in our country as the ultimate goal of world political philosophy; to inherit the orthodox thoughts of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Duke of Zhou, and Confucius in our country, and to take the spirit of universal love as the national revolution and the human revolution, in order to realize the ideal of our nation's great unity world. The Premier founded the Republic of China and served as the leader of the revolution. With his sharp vision, he became a teacher and model for all. He inherited the traditional cultural thoughts of our predecessors and extracted the outline of the Three Principles of the People as a principle. The Western philosopher GWa　as wrote in his book "Social Heritage" that mankind sometimes uses broad and conscious efforts to measure and impart the entire inheritance of its society, and to make the new and the old become a systematic relationship, such as Greece in the time of Socrates, Italy in the Renaissance, and France in the revolutionary era. Therefore, revolution is not difficult. It is difficult to revolutionize and to make the new and the old become a systematic relationship, to measure and impart the entire inheritance of its society. The French Revolution destroyed for more than eighty years, and Mr. Wah still enjoyed praising it. If he was born today and understood the true meaning of the late Premier's revolution, then he would not know how to praise it. Alas, the Premier's doctrine is broad and profound, inheriting the past and opening up the future. It is rooted in the old cultural thoughts of our country for thousands of years and develops the new era trend of the 20th century. From its horizontal perspective, it is the survival of the fittest; from its vertical perspective, it is eternal survival.</p>
<p>(II) Striving, Not Struggling The Premier devoted his life to revolution, and even on his deathbed, he had to call out, "Peaceful struggle to save China." To save China, we must struggle, and struggle must be carried out peacefully. If struggle cannot be peaceful, it will evolve into strife, which will violate the late Premier's legacy of universal love. The Book of Rites says, "Strive to the light of supreme virtue." The Book of Changes says, "A thunder comes out of the ground, stirring." This striving has the meaning of promoting and shocking. Its way is supreme and firm. The Analects says, "What a gentleman strives for." This striving is not the same as struggling. I still remember that,</p>
<p>"King Xiang said to King Han, "The world has been in turmoil for several years because of us two. I am willing to challenge King Han to determine the outcome, rather than making the people of the world suffer for nothing." King Han smiled and said, "I would rather fight wits than fight strength." (See Historical Records)</p>
<p>Fighting wits is striving, and fighting strength is struggling. Striving has the spirit of intelligence, advancement, benevolence, courage, and perseverance. Struggling is an act of cruelty, brutality, violence, and plunder. The division between striving and struggling can be thought of more than half way here.</p>
<p>(III) Saving the World with Peace The Premier's goal of national revolution is not only to seek the liberation of all ethnic groups in the country, but also to seek the freedom and equality of all mankind in the world, so as to ascend to the great unity. Looking at the international situation, it is getting worse and worse. The United Kingdom and Germany are now in deep water. Their suffering from foreign economic oppression is almost the same as our suffering from the military force of the Japanese Empire. During the world economic crisis, which has evolved into an international political problem, the social system is tending towards stagnation. The current organization is approaching its end. The future is worrisome and peace is difficult to achieve. Only the Three Principles of the People is the ladder of peaceful evolution and the savior in desperation. Taking the land problem as an example, scholars around the world have exhausted their brains, but it is still difficult to solve. China implemented the well-field system in the Zhou Dynasty, the king's field system in the Han Dynasty, the equal-field system in the Northern Wei Dynasty, and the official-field system in the Southern Song Dynasty. However, although there were many systems, the implementation was ineffective, causing only trouble. In the end, it still flowed into a bad private system. The Premier, based on the principle of equality, used peaceful methods to implement equal land rights, creating a new system unprecedented in thousands of years. In addition, he restrained capital, eliminated monopolies, developed public services, enriched the country and the people, solved China's social problems, and gave the world the same goal. That is, to advance and cooperate with all mankind in the world, to seek the fair distribution of wealth, so that they can live and work in peace and realize the world of the people, ruled by the people, and enjoyed by the people. Therefore, we who follow the late Premier's legacy must not forget the late Premier's entire purpose of national revolution, which is to save the world, so that the late Premier's spirit of saving the world with peace will not be obscured by distortion and misunderstanding, and can be fully revealed to the world, to gain international sympathy, and at least to avoid the rampant extreme thoughts of communism and nationalism in the country, and to avoid the cyclical aggression of imperialism abroad. If the imperialists can understand the implementation of the Three Principles of the People in our country, the pursuit of national salvation, and the pursuit of the people's Three Principles of the People and University Education (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e82">A Contradictory Phenomenon in the Cry for National Salvation - Hai Chang <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲ Teachers, Students, and Various Provinces</p>
<p>National salvation cannot be achieved through empty talk, nor through pasting slogans, shouting slogans, boycotts, parades, telegrams, or declarations. All those engaged in national salvation work must have a genuine expression of patriotism, setting an example with unwavering commitment. Only then will their words and actions be credible and effective. Otherwise, even before five minutes have passed, no one will believe they are truly saving the country.</p>
<p>Currently, the most enthusiastic and sacrificing group in the cause of national salvation is undoubtedly the students. The students' patriotic fervor is, of course, the result of education. It is already a pitiful state when only a few intellectuals are enthusiastic about saving the country, running around and calling for action, when the nation is in such danger. But can these few saviors of the country be trusted for their genuine expression of patriotism? I dare not answer. Look at the current college students; almost none of them are without Western suits and leather shoes. Almost none of the female students are without foreign coats and high-heeled leather shoes. Almost all the materials adorning them are foreign goods. The patriotic youth claim to be overthrowing imperialism every day, yet they are also very eager and respectful in offering money to imperialists, buying and wearing their decorative materials, considering themselves fashionable and glorious. What a self-contradictory act of national salvation!</p>
<p>Because the youth saviors of the country have such self-contradictory behaviors, their sacrifices cannot be forgiven by the government or trusted by the people. The government's disapproval has become obvious recently, and the people's lack of sympathy may be doubted. However, students who have been to the countryside to promote the cause should know how cold the villagers are towards us. And we must know that these villagers still account for more than 80% of the national population. Once, when students were giving a speech in the countryside about boycotting Japanese goods, the villagers said, "We villagers have never used foreign goods. It would be good if you students yourselves don't use Japanese goods." Indeed, let's now compare a male or female student who talks about patriotism all the time with an ignorant country bumpkin or village girl who doesn't know what patriotism is. One is wearing a foreign hat, suit, watch, fountain pen, leather shoes, coat, etc., with nothing on their body that isn't a foreign product. The other is wearing a cloth hat, blue cloth shirt and pants, cloth shoes, etc., unable to find a single foreign product on their body. Comparing the two, who is patriotic and who is not?</p>
<p>There have already been eight or nine boycotts of Japanese goods. The longest boycott lasted no more than six months, and before and after the boycott, imports of Japanese goods routinely surged, so the effect was ultimately equal to zero. The reason for the ineffectiveness of these boycotts is clearly that the Chinese people do not have the determination to use domestic goods, especially the young men and women who claim to be patriotic. Their words and actions do not match, and their worship of foreign goods is too strong. So today, they are bullied by the Japanese and boycott Japanese goods, using British or other foreign goods. Tomorrow, they are bullied by the British and boycott British goods, using Japanese or other foreign goods. Boycotting back and forth only enriches foreigners. China's economic leakages are only increasing year by year, and the phenomenon of poverty is only intensifying year by year. Even without the military aggression of imperialism, the bankruptcy of China's national economy is already apparent.</p>
<p>China's science is underdeveloped, and the import of foreign machinery and various industrial products is a natural trend. Only clothing materials are readily available in China, so there is really no need to use foreign goods. Ever since the psychology of wearing Western suits as fashionable was actively promoted by the education sector, it has become very common among all classes in the country. Wearing Western suits and using foreign materials is, of course, not surprising. But wearing Chinese clothing and using broadcloth to make mandarin jackets and serge to make robes, or georgette and Indian silk to make cheongsams, is really unnecessary. Since foreign goods have already "clothed China," the original silk industry has plummeted, and the sales of native cloth have almost been cut off. If there were no foreign clothing materials imported now, a large part of China would have to be naked.</p>
<p>The trend of Chinese people wearing Western suits has only been popular for the past twenty years. Forty years ago, first-class Chinese diplomats such as Li Hongzhang and Zeng Jize, and first-class students studying abroad such as Yan Fu and Gu Hongming, still wore Chinese clothing and dragged their braids when they were abroad. Twenty years ago, although students studying abroad wore Western suits, they changed back to Chinese clothing after returning to China. The braids were cut off and could not be reattached, so a fake little braid was put in a small hat. People today may say they were stubborn, but they were indeed knowledgeable in both Chinese and Western learning. Their attitude of "a gentleman studies extensively and dresses according to his homeland" is beyond the reach of ordinary students studying abroad today. Since the President So-and-so and Empress So-and-so ships brought back hundreds and thousands of gilded PhDs and masters one after another, people would not know how "broad" and how "masterful" they were except for their foreign language and writing. So they absolutely refuse to wear Chinese clothing, showing that they are extraordinary and superior. The greatest use of these PhDs and masters, of course, is to teach in schools, so college students, middle school students, and even elementary school students all follow the example of their teachers' attire, preparing to become future PhDs and masters. So foreign firm clerks, company runners, and even hooligans, gigolos, and prostitutes also dress in Western suits and leather shoes, pretending to be new figures of the new era. Since Western suits have stolen the show, the outdated Chinese clothing is only worn by country bumpkins, village women, and people who have no money. Fortunately, the number of students is still a very small minority of the national population. When education becomes truly universal in the future, it will be the day when Chinese clothing is completely eliminated. At that time, all domestic silk shops and native cloth shops will have to close, and the workers who make domestic clothing materials will starve to death. (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲ Salary Reduction for Teachers and Staff Not Yet Considered</p>
<p>▲ Order Already Issued to the Finance Department for Compliance</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, due to a budget shortfall of six to seven million for this year, proposed to reduce the expenses of all agencies to 75% as a standard remedy. This led to petitions from teachers and staff of Hangzhou County Normal School, Provincial High School, and First Middle School, arguing that reducing education funding would hinder education. They presented eight points of difficulty to the Provincial Government, requesting exemption from the reduction. The Provincial Government believes that education is related to the foundation of the country and should be vigorously safeguarded. As for reducing the salaries of teachers and staff, it has not yet been considered. An instruction was issued to the teachers and staff of the said schools and to the Finance Department for compliance. The original order is transcribed as follows: According to the petitions submitted by Wang Yiwen, Yuan Yi, and other teachers and staff of the Provincial High School and Hangzhou Normal School, requesting that the education funds be exempted from reduction and that monthly payments be made to maintain and benefit education, etc., in response to this, it is hereby notified that the province's finances are extremely difficult, and the amount of the shortfall between income and expenditure this year has reached six to seven million. It is necessary to reduce all budget items as much as possible to maintain. As education is related to the foundation of the country, the government will spare no effort to safeguard all education funds in the province within the possible scope. The salary reduction for staff has not yet been considered. In addition to ordering the Finance Department to issue the education funds on a monthly basis, it is hereby notified, etc. After the instruction is posted, the original petition is copied and sent to the said department for compliance.

<h3 id="e84">Shanghai Education Community's Joint National Salvation Association's Letter of Advice to Students to Resume Classes <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Community's Joint National Salvation Association's Letter of Advice to Students to Resume Classes states: Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was thought that China would eliminate all malpractices, alleviate the people's distress, recuperate and nurture the national foundation, unite our nation, promote our civil rights, and work together to solve the people's livelihood problems in order to reach a state of great harmony. The people's desire for governance was so great that the clouds and rain in a great drought were not enough to describe even one hundredth of it. Who would have thought that the political program would be lost, and villains would fill the court? Reciting Mencius's words, "When the ruler has no moral standards, the subjects have no laws to follow. The court does not believe in the Way, and the craftsmen do not believe in the rules. Gentlemen commit offenses against righteousness, and commoners commit crimes against the law," how can one not be heartbroken? We have often sighed while teaching. Our young students, seeing that China has the pain of sinking and fearing that the overturned nest will have no intact eggs, throw down their pens and books, and rise up resolutely, spending the light of an inch of jade and making desperate calls with bare hands. Petitioning, propaganda, and fundraising, braving frost and dew and eating and sleeping in the wind without taking care of themselves. This spirit of pure sacrifice, righteousness, courage, and patriotism is sympathized with by all Chinese people, especially we who have close ties with you and know each other well. However, the current situation is gradually developing. Issues such as the neutralization of Jinzhou, joint management of Tianjin, and direct negotiations may not be realized for the time being, and Chiang Kai-shek also knows that the country's affairs are difficult and the future is hard, so he retreats bravely and telegraphs his resignation. Our young students, at this juncture, should resolutely jump out of the whirlpool, cleanse their bodies, restrain their thoughts, and cultivate their morals, so as to become great talents. Who else but you can shoulder great responsibilities? The most urgent task of the current government is to organize everything in an orderly manner, so that it can be transformed. Only by concentrating the spirit can it be organized. The tranquility of the people can concentrate the spirit. The responsibility of awakening the people and urging the government is fulfilled. In the future, the government should be responsible for renewing national politics and broadly planning the national economy, and give it sufficient time. In addition to chanting, we should still adhere to our supervisory responsibilities. Studying without forgetting national salvation has already been done by you. Saving the country without forgetting to study is what we hope you will continue to do. The ancients said that wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and meanness cannot move, and power and force cannot subdue. It also said that one anger makes the princes fear, and peaceful residence makes the world calm. It also said to be as still as a virgin and as fast as a fleeing rabbit, to advance with righteousness and retreat with propriety, to be able to release and able to收. This is the business of a great man, the conduct of a great man. Let's further verify it with historical facts. Advancing is like a tide, and retreating is like a mountain. This is why Yue Fei's army was able to establish extraordinary achievements. Zhang Mai rose up in anger, but was outwardly strong and inwardly weak, unable to advance or retreat, unable to maneuver. This is why the Jin army was defeated miserably. You, you, think it over carefully. In short, in our humble opinion, the government's past mistakes do not need to be concealed. The spirit of your patriotism cannot be criticized. But today, you should rein in your horses and turn movement into stillness, giving the current government time to work and advancing your own morals. This is the only way forward. I especially offer my sincere advice and hope that you will think deeply and carefully with a calm mind. How fortunate, how fortunate!</p>

<h3 id="e87">Another Statement from Aurora University <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Aurora University sent a letter yesterday stating: Dear Editor, after reading the education news column in today's newspaper, the letter from the Aurora Anti-Japanese Association contained statements that were completely untrue. The school has never adopted any repressive measures against students' anti-Japanese work. When the Anti-Japanese Association was established, it even donated a large sum of money. Students were allowed to hold meetings, discuss, post notices, and conduct propaganda freely without any obstruction. Military training has also been specially intensified, increasing to six hours per week. As for those who stayed in school after the holiday, there are still 78 non-religious students and only 31 religious students. The lists are available for verification. The statements in the letter are nothing more than fabrications from one or two irresponsible students who intend to confuse the public. If there are any more such inaccurate records in the future, we will ignore them to avoid the labor of correction. Sincerely, Aurora University, December 17th.</p>

<p>▲ Length of 3,200 Meters, Registration Starts on January 10th, Race on February 21st</p>
<p>丨Simultaneously with a 13-Mile Long Run丨</p>
<p>This year, the Chinese team won the championship and individual first place in the International Race Walking Competition, and set a new record of two hours, twenty-seven minutes, and three seconds. The championship has been won for four consecutive years, which is an unprecedented honor. Moreover, the entire Chinese team finished the race without anyone dropping out halfway, which is truly commendable. The Chinese Race Walking Association, in view of the interest in race walking and its value in international sports, and to promote it, has specially initiated an open 13-mile long-distance race walking competition in Shanghai, scheduled to be held on Sunday, February 21st next year. The route is exactly the same as the International Race Walking Competition, but it turns back from Huaihai Road and ends at the Chinese Athletics Field on Route Tenant de la Tour. (Detailed route map will be published later) At the same time, a women's open race walking competition will be held, the length of which is 3,200 meters, or about two miles, which is also to promote women's sports. Registration will start on January 10th. Non-members who join must pay 20 cents at the time of registration, and women's race walking is free. As for women's race walking, because it is an initiative, it is expected that there will be no shortage of participants from the many women's physical education schools in Shanghai. However, if there are concerns that the posture is not very clear, the association will send experienced personnel to provide voluntary guidance for schools and groups that send letters.</p>

<p>When the representatives boarded the special train at the third platform, it was guarded by tax police from the temporary Zhabei police station. The special train originally had only seven cars. At 8:40 AM, due to the large number of passengers going to Beijing, Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, Wang Faqin, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Gongbo, and Gu Mengyu shared car PCm1, while Sun Ke, Wu Chaochu, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, Fu Bingchang, Chen Jianru, Zhong Tianxin, He Yaozu, and others shared flower car PCM2. The other attendants were divided among three cars, which were almost full. Therefore, He Yaozu instructed the station to add a first-class car. An armored train had already departed five minutes earlier to clear the tracks. The Railway Bureau specially assigned Xu Shibin to accompany and entertain the passengers. It was reported that yesterday's lunch, one hundred and twenty Western-style meals, was pre-ordered by the Guangdong Liaison Office in Shanghai to feed those who had registered the day before yesterday. Photography reporters from various Shanghai newspapers also went to Beijing, so the total number of people was about three hundred or more.</p>

<p>When Zou Lu arrived at the station and saw the Volunteer Corps standing tall and spirited to see them off, Zou Lu gave them words of encouragement and expressed his apologies before hurrying onto the train. The reporter met Zou on the train and conducted an interview. According to Zou, about ninety people were traveling together today. Mr. Wang (Jingwei) would probably not be able to depart in the next two or three days. His condition was the same as before, but slightly better. Mr. Xie Huiseng is currently recuperating in Hangzhou and is expected to send news soon and will also go to Beijing. The First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is scheduled to open on the 21st. After the meeting, I may need to come to Shanghai again. Mr. Hu Zhantang has not yet announced his departure date from Hong Kong. Shanghai has now appointed adjutants Feng Ciqi and Liang Qingyun to be responsible for entertaining the Central Committee members coming from Guangdong.</p>

<p>According to Chen Gongbo's conversation with the reporter from the New Voice Society in the train, he had spent most of his time overseas in Belgium. After returning to China, he had only been back for two months. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 7th of this month. The fact that the Central Committee members going to Beijing could gather together was a blessing for the future of the country. As for Mr. Wang (Jingwei)'s condition, doctors have examined him and found that his urine contains about 197 parts of sugar, while normal people only have about 70 parts. If it increases by another ten parts or so, it could lead to a coma. Doctors have instructed him to rest and recuperate for the time being, so Mr. Wang will not be able to go to Beijing for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e99">▲Welcome in the Capital <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>

<p>After Sun, Wu, and others arrived in Beijing, they issued a joint statement saying, "Our only task in coming to Beijing this time is to prepare for the convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to implement the various resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is a major turning point for our country to discard the old and embrace the new. If it can be realized, the resolutions of the Shanghai Peace Conference will open up a new path for future politics. You are all very clear about this point. As for the current diplomatic problems, we have repeatedly declared that we will strive to achieve the goal of restoring territorial sovereignty with the spirit of not losing our rights or humiliating the country, and with perseverance and unwavering determination, in order to live up to the expectations of the people. This is our duty. This time when we come to Beijing, we will have a clearer understanding of the dangers of the Northeast Three Provinces incident. After the establishment of a unified government, we believe that we will be able to respect public opinion, and with the people united, we will be able to exert the spirit of revolutionary diplomacy and employ the military strategies of revolutionary diplomacy to restore the territorial sovereignty of the Northeast Three Provinces. If necessary, we believe that the new government will make the greatest determination and will never fail to live up to the expectations of the people. As for the loss of the Northeast Three Provinces this time, the military and political authorities directly responsible for defending the territory should bear the responsibility and be judged by the public."</p>

The two inspectors investigated Yang Haichang and inspectors of the industry association to see if they were suspected of accepting bribes. However, the two committee members, Lu Jingshi and Li Yongxiang, should reinvestigate. (2) The Cotton Cloth Industry Association sent a letter stating that, according to letters from fellow businesses, the products of Lun Chang Company were sealed by fellow businesses. Recently, the association's announcement stated that the materials were Japanese goods and that the property rights belonged to British merchants, which was ambiguous. Can the company's products be unsealed and sold? Also, the goods sealed by fellow businesses, although they are Japanese goods, the property rights already belong to Chinese merchants, so they can of course be unsealed and sold. The situation is reported and it is hoped that a reply will be provided. How should this case be handled? It was resolved to submit it to the Executive Committee. (3) A letter from Mink Company asked to forward a letter to anti-Japanese associations in various places to prove whether the company's products should be approved. It was resolved to decide that if there are facts, it can be certified on behalf of the company. (4) The Investigation Department was tasked with investigating whether the Yunzhou Factory had registered with the association. It was immediately investigated that the factory's books and registration form matched the association's registration form, so the yarn was indeed registered correctly. It was resolved to return the sealed documents after the matter was presented to the meeting for verification. (5) A letter from the Yarn Industry Association asked whether the Japanese yarn that was imported before the Anti-Japanese Association was established should be allowed to be sold publicly by the association. It was resolved to resolve this issue together after the regulations for sealing Japanese goods are formulated. (6) A letter from Ruifenghao asked to return the detained non-Japanese goods as soon as possible. It was resolved to investigate the case and release the goods.</p>

The Japanese troops have invaded, and the people have not resisted. Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and we are extremely saddened. The general is stationed on the barren frontier, commanding a lone army. He deeply understands righteousness and is a pillar of the country. His righteousness is as high as the clouds, and his prestige shakes China and foreign countries. We admire him and feel deeply attached to him. News came that he had run out of ammunition and was running out of supplies. The disparity between the numbers was too great, and he had retreated to Lun to plan a major offensive. We were both saddened and happy to hear this. The general fought hard and never gave up. His loyalty and bravery were unparalleled. With a lone army suffering from supply difficulties and fatigue after fighting for more than a month, he faced a strong enemy from a country that was like a tiger and a wolf. He still beheaded generals and seized flags, chasing the fleeing enemies. At one cry of his arm, the wounds of the land begin to fester, the world changed color, and ghosts and gods wept. His bravery and heroism can shine with the sun and moon. Victory and defeat are common for soldiers. The general does not need to take this to heart. Reorganize the troops, wait for the opportunity to counterattack, and wherever the banner of righteousness points, it will destroy the fierce and break the strong. We hereby remit 2,000 Shanghai dollars through the Bank of China. A goose feather from a thousand miles expresses our respect. We hope that the general will continue to work hard, fight to the end, annihilate those ugly things, achieve the strange achievements of Jie Zhizi, restore our rivers and mountains, and carry on the legacy of the first martyrs of Fubo. We are filled with indignation as we telegraph, and we respectfully hope that you will take care of yourself. Shanghai Silk and Satin Printing Industry Association, all members and workers."</p>

<p>Indian independence movement leader Mr. Gandhi recently telegraphed Ju Zheng, expressing words of encouragement. Yesterday, Mr. Ju telegraphed a reply to India, saying: "Mr. Gandhi, reading your telegram fills me with both gratitude and shame. We are born to fight for freedom, and we must also die for it. A little sacrifice is not enough to be comforting. I admire Mr. Gandhi's spirit of perseverance and self-restraint, and the virtue of conquering the environment, to inspire more than 300 million people in India to fight for freedom together, and to resist the British government. I cannot help but repeatedly sigh. Those who use virtue to subdue others will ultimately prevail over those who use force to subdue them. Why make people fear you when you can make them admire your virtue? This is the clear difference between Eastern and Western cultures. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our party, advocated the Great Asianism based on Eastern culture, which is the same idea. Therefore, I firmly believe that Mr. Gandhi's spirit of influence will eventually achieve final victory and greatly contribute to the development of world culture. The bright future is not far away. Let us work together with Mr. Gandhi to fulfill the responsibility of our Eastern nations, which is to create a culture that is 'beneficial to justice and humanity.' respectfully, Ju Zheng."</p>

Therefore, a special notice is issued to all those who have obtained certificates, stating that when paying the grain tax for the first time, they should bring their certificates to the office for verification. If the original certificates are pledged elsewhere, they should declare the name of the household and the number of mu (unit of land area) to the office for comparison with the new receipts. After verification, the grain tax can be paid, and the receipts will be issued.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai County Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating: "According to the autumn harvest records this year, the provincial committee went to various villages to conduct a survey, together with the bureau, and requested that the grain tax of the entire county be reduced by 0.7%. The Finance Department has approved this request, and it has been announced. Now, the winter grain tax collection for the 20th year of the Republic has been announced on the 5th of this month. Therefore, the reduction in tax rate based on the autumn survey is announced for the information of all grain households in the county."</p>

<h3 id="e145">Impersonating Detectives to Extort Two Thousand Dollars <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhang Jifu led a group armed with guns</p>
<p>▲ Wu Zhuohui was terrified</p>
<p>▲ First borrowed a hundred foreign dollars to hand over</p>
<p>▲ Then reported to the police, who made arrests</p>
<p>Wu Zhuohui, a 28-year-old native of Jinhua, Zhejiang, and former head of the Zhejiang Anti-Smuggling Brigade, resides on the third floor of No. 1 Lianyi Fang, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. On the morning of the 12th of this month, at 9:00 AM, Zhang Jifu, a native of Shaoxing, residing at No. 234 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, and Tong Jianzhong, a native of Taizhou, residing at No. 1 Ruihua Fang, Rue Bayle, French Concession, and Qiu Yaoshan, a native of Shaoxing, along with five others, carrying handguns, impersonated detectives from the French Police and the Garrison Headquarters. They went to Wu's house and claimed that the National Government had offered a reward of 5,000 yuan for his arrest because he had impersonated a division commander. They said that if he paid 2,000 yuan, they could settle the matter privately and report that he had moved out. Wu was terrified and, having no money at home, borrowed 100 foreign dollars from a friend and handed it over. They agreed to pay the remaining amount at 1:00 PM on the 15th. On the morning of the 16th, at 9:00 AM, Zhang and his gang went to collect the money again. Wu notified the doorman, Shi Baorong, who reported to the police. The police dispatched detectives and arrested Zhang and his two accomplices. The police found Jiangsu Security Team badges, letters of appointment, photographs, and other items on the three men. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Luo Renji interrogated them. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendants had impersonated police detectives to extort money from the plaintiff by intimidation. He requested that they be prosecuted under Articles 165 and 370 of the Criminal Law. However, two other accomplices had not been apprehended, and the handguns had not been recovered. He requested that the hearing be postponed. The plaintiff, Wu Zhuohui, testified that when the defendants came, there were six of them. They showed him Jiangsu Security Team cards. When they saw that he had two handguns, the first defendant claimed to be a special detective from the police, and the third defendant said he was a detective from the Garrison Headquarters. They said he had impersonated the Seventh Division Commander of Guangdong, and the National Government had issued a warrant for his arrest with a reward of 5,000 yuan. They had orders to arrest him with the police. The second defendant pulled him into the room and said, "Are you willing to pay 2,000 yuan to settle the matter privately?" They sent accomplices to guard the door and the stairs to prevent family members from entering or leaving. He was intimidated and had no choice but to agree. Because he had no money at home, he invited his friend Hu Shuanglai from the Oriental Hotel to borrow 100 foreign dollars, which he gave to the second defendant. He agreed to pay the remaining 1,900 yuan at 1:00 PM on the 15th and was told to move and hide temporarily. They left at 3:00 PM. On the morning of the 16th, at 9:00 AM, the defendants came to collect the money again. He had notified the doorman in advance, who reported to the police, and they were arrested. The witness, Shi Baorong, testified that on the 15th, he saw the defendants go to Wu's place and then saw Wu sending them off, looking worried. The second defendant held his hand. After they left, he asked Wu what had happened. Wu told him to be on guard and report to the police if they came again. The defendants came again on the 16th, and he reported to the police and they were arrested. Under interrogation, the defendant Zhang Jifu confessed that he was a military detective in the Jiangsu Security Team and was currently on leave. Tong confessed that he had worked in the military and was now unemployed. Qiu confessed that he was formerly the director of the Meixi Public Security Bureau. All denied impersonating and extorting money. The interrogation was adjourned. Judge Luo ordered the defendants to be detained and scheduled a new hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e146">National Glassware Factory Established Amidst Boycott <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Five companies in Shanghai, including the Commercial Press, the China Bookstore, the Science Instrument Museum, and the Dafeng Company, believe that boycotting Japanese goods amidst the anti-Japanese movement is an excellent policy for economic severance from Japan. However, the fundamental solution lies in actively promoting national products and creating national goods. Most glassware is imported, resulting in a significant annual outflow of wealth. To recover these rights and develop national products, they initiated the establishment of the China National Chemical Glassware Industry Production and Sales Cooperative Co., Ltd. Preparations have been underway for a month and are now complete. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held at the Instrument Industry Association. Guo Meisheng was elected chairman, and Wang Baoyun, representing the Social Affairs Bureau, provided guidance. After the chairman reported on the progress of the preparations, the articles of association were approved, and officers were elected. As a result, Lin Dian, Guo Meisheng, Xue Jian, Gu Dingmei, and Zhang Chunnian were elected as directors, and Sheng Tongsun and Chang Boyan were elected as alternates. Xie Jintang and Wo Chunzhuang were elected as supervisors. After the meeting, the first board meeting was held, and Guo Meisheng was elected chairman of the board, Hu Jigan was elected manager, Chang Boyan was elected technician, and Wo Zhiqing was elected accountant. It was also decided to start operations in January of next year at Baoxing Road and Tiantong'an Road. It is reported that the company has received full subscriptions from five companies, including the China Bookstore, the Commercial Press, the Science Instrument Museum, the Shixue Tongyi Museum, and the Dafeng Company, totaling 10,000 yuan. Another 10,000 yuan of subscriptions has also been fully subscribed.</p>

<p>▲ Effective January Next Year</p>
<p>The city-operated Pujiang Ferry from Shanghai to Donggou has ticket prices largely based on the old Pujiang Embankment Works Relief. It is reported that the authorities recently measured the distance of the route and assessed the current traffic situation and felt that the prices were not commensurate. Therefore, they submitted a report to the municipal government, which approved a reasonable increase or decrease in ticket prices at each pier based on distance. The prices from Shanghai to Donggou will be changed to 12 cents for second class, 25 cents for first class, and 40 cents for special class.

<h3 id="e148">Methods for Preventing and Treating Coal Poisoning <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲ Notice from the Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of recent reports of residents in the city dying from coal poisoning, has issued a notice in vernacular Chinese, stating: "In the cold winter, many households have stoves in their homes. If one is not careful, they can be poisoned by coal gas, endangering their lives, which is very frightening. Our bureau wants to alleviate this harm, so every winter, we will announce prevention and first aid methods to the public through leaflets or newspapers, so that they can know what to avoid. We have done this for many years, but recently, reading the newspapers, we still often see tragic incidents of coal gas poisoning. This shows that citizens usually do not pay attention to hygiene. Once poisoned, it is too late to regret. Now, we will announce the avoidance methods to the public again, hoping that everyone will pay attention and not ignore them because they are simple. This is very important. (1) Cause of Poisoning: Coal balls or coal blocks emit a gas called carbon monoxide when they are not burned to a very bright state. This gas is colorless and odorless, and it is often difficult to detect. If you smell it for too long, your breathing will become tight, your face will turn red, you will become dizzy, and your mind will become unclear, as if you are drunk. If the poisoning is too deep, you will die. Even if it is mild, you will be sick for a few days. (2) Prevention Methods: When burning coal or charcoal in a room, be sure to install a chimney or vent pipe. If there is no chimney or vent pipe, you must burn it in a well-ventilated area outside the house until it is very bright before moving it indoors. You should also do this when adding coal. Also, when burning coal indoors, you must open one or two windows to allow air to circulate between the indoor and outdoor air. It is best not to burn coal or charcoal when sleeping at night. If you still burn it, you must not close the doors and windows tightly so that they are not ventilated. In short, when burning anything in a room, you must ensure that the outdoor air and the indoor air can circulate and exchange fully. People in the room should also often go outdoors to relax. (3) First Aid for Poisoning: If someone is unfortunately poisoned by coal gas, quickly move them to a well-ventilated area. Loosen their clothing and perform artificial respiration. The method is as follows: Loosen the poisoned person's clothing, lay them flat, and raise their back with pillows or other objects to allow their lungs to expand. Stand behind their head, slowly lift the poisoned person's arms forward, stretch them over their head, and then slowly lower them to the sides of their body, gently pressing down. Repeat this process until the poisoned person wakes up. After waking up, you should still seek medical treatment to recover your health. Otherwise, there may be underlying health problems, so be careful. It is best to perform first aid and seek Western medical treatment immediately. Although the above is very common, it is very important. Coal companies and coal ball companies in the city should print the above methods into leaflets and distribute them to customers when selling them so that users can be alarmed and pay attention. Although it may be a little troublesome for the sellers, the public will benefit a lot. This is not only related to personal morality but also the responsibility that should be fulfilled in human mutual assistance. I hope everyone will implement it properly."</p>

<h3 id="e150">Dan Yaonan and Others Committed Four Robberies and One Kidnapping <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chen Jingwu and Seven Others Released</p>
<p>▲ Escorting Bandits to Detention for a Later Hearing</p>
<p>Fan Defu, the Chinese detective chief, and detectives Jin Yangwu, Liu Ronggen, Zhou Guisheng, and Bao Zhengting, from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, previously arrested 24 male and female kidnappers, including Dan Yaonan, at No. 50 Taopeng Lane, Taopeng Road, and other places, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. The Chinese and Western detectives have now discovered that the defendants committed four robberies and helped with one kidnapping. The details are as follows: (1) At around 12:00 AM on July 2 of this year, more than 20 bandits armed with guns broke into the home of Cai Zhaotang, a resident of Ping'an Township, Jiangjing County, Jiangbei, and robbed him of more than 40 silver dollars. They also kidnapped Cai's younger brother, Zhaoting, his aunt, a certain Ms. Cai, and his daughter, Lian'di, 18 years old, his son, Lianbao, 12 years old, and his son, Lianfu (also known as Guan Hou), 10 years old, and fled to the Haimen area. They sent a letter to Cai Zhaotang demanding a ransom of 60,000 foreign dollars. Later, because the Haimen area was encountering government troops suppressing bandits, Cai Zhaoting, Cai Lian'di, and his aunt took the opportunity to escape. Lianbao was taken to Changshu and abandoned on the road. He was found by the police, who took him to the police station. After questioning him, they learned the details and notified Cai's family. On November 23, his mother went to pick him up. Lianfu, a child, was taken to Shanghai, hidden in various places. On the 2nd of this month, after the defendants were arrested, their accomplices knew that the situation was urgent and difficult to hide. On the morning of the 7th of this month, at 2:00 AM, they abandoned Cai Lianfu at the intersection of Dengtuo Road and Broadway Road. Xie Futang, the Chinese detective chief of the General Inspectorate, saw the child crying on the road and took him to the police station. After questioning him, he learned that he was a hostage and sent him to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for temporary custody. (2) Robbery of a steelyard worth five corners from the Zhoujiazui Road No. 2572 sauce garden. (3) Robbery of 57 silver dollars from the No. 3 Jingzhou Road sauce garden. (4) Robbery of 71 dollars worth of property from the Song Renxiang family at No. 453 Kunming Road. Robbery of 400 dollars worth of property from the Mao Guanqing family at No. 897 Waimai Gen Road. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled to open. The police, along with the victims, sent the 24 male and female individuals, including Dan Yaonan, to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated the previous situation, saying that Chen Jingwu, Wu Zengcai, Li Zhizhong, Zhu Chenzhi, Yi Hongfang, Xue Lianghou, and Liu Xueshi, seven people, were not related to the cases, and requested that they be released first. There was also one person, Zhao Songshu. Although there was no evidence against him, he was going to Taopeng Road to find the defendant Zhao Zhenghua when he was arrested, and Zhao had committed several robberies in the concession and had a secret conversation with the defendant Wang Guidi in the prison car. It was found that Wang was related to the Jiangjing kidnapping case, and the police had obtained an official document from the court notifying the Jiangjing County government. Therefore, Zhao Songshu was suspicious and should be allowed to continue to be detained. After Judge Feng Shide verified the confessions, he ordered that Chen Jingwu and the other seven people be released, and Zhao Songshu be detained. Then, the trial of the robbery case began. After each victim testified to the robbery, because it was past noon, Judge Feng briefly questioned the defendants and ordered Dan Yaonan and the others to be detained separately, pending a later hearing. The child Cai Lianfu was still temporarily held in the police station by detectives because his father had not arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Yuan Lai Hang Asks for Quick Resolution of the Confiscated Potato Flour Case <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>Yuan Lai Hang sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association the other day, stating, "Dear sirs, our company's confiscated Dutch potato flour was mistakenly resolved by your council to be confiscated. We have prepared documents stating the reasons and requesting reconsideration. We have been honored to have your council decide to resubmit to the review, and your council has twice sent letters asking our company representatives to attend the review committee for statements, and all original documents have also been submitted for verification. The review committee has also sent personnel to various relevant agencies, such as the banks handling remittances, the shipping companies transporting the confiscated goods, and the telegraph bureau Jianghai Customs, for on-site investigation and verification, and it has been found that the evidence is conclusive and the confiscated goods are indeed Dutch goods, which can be found in today's newspaper regarding the review report of this case. Based on this situation, the injustice suffered by our company before can be clarified to the world. Your council members are all outstanding talents in Shanghai, and they will have a fair resolution on this case, so there is no need to nag again. However, our company's potato flour has been confiscated for four months, and the capital is accumulated and the pain is deep. In the meantime, we have been mistakenly resolved to confiscate the application for reconsideration, take photos and publish the newspapers, hire lawyers, and all kinds of expenses are especially not small. If our company's manager did not work diligently day and night and try his best to support it, and at this time when the market is depressed and the capital is extremely tight, I am afraid that our company would have gone bankrupt before the case was clarified. This difficulty should be understood by all council members who understand the business situation. Now the Shanghai market situation is even more lifeless, and the end of the year is approaching. Although our company is still trying its best to support it, it has actually reached the last stage of lingering and cannot be delayed any longer to wait for your council's calm disposal. For this reason, we have stated the following situation. We respectfully ask your council to consider our company's difficult and urgent situation, which is like the disaster victims turning around in the trenches. We hope that the charities will provide assistance as soon as possible and submit this case for resolution and return it as soon as possible in order to come to life and maintain commerce. The council members' merits will be immeasurable."</p>

<h3 id="e153">Words and Actions of the Japanese Fleet Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>▲ Imura's Absurd Remarks</p>
<p>▲ U.S. Ships Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>The Japanese naval training squadron Asama and Iwate, carrying 170 naval students, departed from Etajima on November 17, passing through Zhenhai, Korea, taking routes through Dalian, Lushun, Qingdao and Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, they were greeted by Rear Admiral Shiozawa, commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Squadron stationed in Shanghai. The situation of Japanese officials and civilians in Shanghai and the Japanese Club giving a public banquet to the officers and students has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, after the fleet commander arrived in Shanghai, he issued an absurd declaration, and the follow-up news and investigation are as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Imura's Rebellious Declaration After the fleet arrived in Shanghai, when the Shanghai Japanese expatriates and naval officers feasted the officers and students of the squadron yesterday, Commander-in-Chief Imura Shintaro issued a declaration, generally saying that the fleet departed from Japan, passing through Korea, South Manchuria, Qingdao and other places to Shanghai. The main purpose of this visit is to enable the officers and students of the two ships to understand the situation in Manchuria, Mongolia, and Shandong, because Dalian is the gateway to South Manchuria, Manchuria and Mongolia are the gateway to Korea, and Qingdao is the gateway to Shandong. The three places are important lands of the empire in terms of national defense and economy, and they are necessary for naval officers and students to know. In the future, in economic warfare and national defense warfare, all ships and officers and students of the team must stand on the first line to fight, and it is even more impossible not to let them know, etc. His ambition for aggression and the fallacy of his words are sufficient to prove his premeditation in this declaration.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting Foreign Warships Yesterday, the fleet commander, Imura, accompanied by Rear Admiral Shiozawa, the commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Squadron of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai, visited the commanders and captains of the naval vessels of the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, and France stationed in Shanghai. In the afternoon, the students of the two ships went ashore to tour, and in the evening, they attended a public banquet of the First Overseas Dispatch Squadron. In addition to the naval officers and students, the two ships Asama and Iwate had a total of 1,439 officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>▲ History of the Two Ships The training ship Iwate, which came to Shanghai this time, has a displacement of 9,796 tons and was built in the 39th year of the Meiji era. During the Russo-Japanese War, it fought in the waters of Lushun and participated in the battle in the waters of Vladivostok and sank a Russian ship in the waters of Ulsan. The Asama has a displacement of 9,737 tons, was built in the 32nd year of the Meiji era. During the Boxer Rebellion, the ship went to Dagu, in the Russo-Japanese War, the ship blockaded the mouth of Lushun harbor, and during the Sino-Japanese War, the ship also participated. The shells that the ship received during the European War are still preserved on the ship.</p>
<p>▲ U.S. Destroyer Follows When the two Japanese ships sailed into Shanghai, the U.S. destroyer No. 226, the Barray, followed the Japanese ships into the Huangpu River. After the Japanese ships docked in Shanghai, the U.S. ships also berthed at the Meifu Wharf. According to Commander Imura yesterday, the ships will leave Shanghai at dawn on the 20th and return to Japan. On March 1 of next year, they will conduct a long-distance cruise, carrying the same group of students to the South Pacific Islands and East Indies, Australia.</p>
<h3 id="e154">After the Great Virtue Wheel Fire, the Chu Heng Wheel Sails to Handle the Aftermath <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Great Yu Wheel Sails to Inspect with Passengers and Merchants</p>
<p>▲ The Exact Number of Deaths is Difficult to Determine at This Time</p>
<p>After the Great Virtue Wheel of the Shanghai Dalian Company was destroyed by fire, the company sent the Chu Heng Wheel yesterday to handle the aftermath, and the Great Yu Wheel sailed with passengers and merchants to inspect. The exact number of deaths has not yet been determined. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>▲ Handling the Aftermath The company's board of directors believed that the Chu Yuan Wheel was salvaging corpses at the site of the accident of the Xu Yuan Wheel, but because the river surface was wide, no corpses had been salvaged. Therefore, the Chu Heng Wheel was sent from Shanghai at 0:30 AM yesterday to help the Chu Yuan Wheel salvage corpses and handle the aftermath, and to try to tow back the hull of the Great Virtue Wheel.</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Notice The company issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating that its Great Virtue Wheel set sail on the 12th with 1,052 pieces of cargo and passengers. Unfortunately, on the 13th, when it sailed to the Qiwangsha River surface in Xupu, it suddenly caught fire. It was reported that it was immediately rescued by special vessels. It is now reported that the rescue was ineffective, and the entire ship was destroyed by fire, leaving only the hull. It is currently under investigation whether the cargo is still intact. For fear that various firms will be concerned, in addition to notifying those who know their addresses by special letter, we hereby declare.</p>
<p>▲ Passenger Inspection Passengers and merchants aboard the Great Virtue Wheel are still uncertain whether their cargo was intact after the fire. In order to understand the truth and the situation at the time, they met with various insurance companies and chartered the Great Yu Wheel from the company yesterday. It set sail at 6:00 AM to inspect the site of the accident.</p>
<p>▲ Loading Corpses to Shanghai When the Guangxiang Wheel sailed from Haimen to Shanghai at 2:00 AM yesterday, it loaded the corpse of Luo Jiaham, a teahouse man from the Big Sea Wheel. The company prepared a coffin for burial. At 1:00 PM, when the Daqing Wheel arrived in Shanghai, it loaded the coffin of Xin Lijun, the old rail man from the Great Virtue Wheel, from Yaogang. So far, only 13 corpses of passengers and crew members who died in the disaster have been discovered. Moreover, the exact number of deaths is difficult to determine because those who jumped into the river have drifted away with the waves, and those who were burned to death on the ship cannot be identified.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Establishment of the International Trade Bureau <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Industry, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, planned to reorganize the Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Visits into the International Trade Bureau. He telegraphed Guo Bingwen, director of the China Institute in America who was lecturing in the United States, to return home to prepare for the establishment. After receiving the order, Mr. Guo immediately proceeded with the preparations, referring to the established practices of trade bureaus in various countries, drafted regulations, and determined all operational plans for the International Trade Bureau. The details obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Internal Organization The organizational regulations of the International Trade Bureau were first drafted by Mr. Guo and submitted to the ministry for review and transfer. They were revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated for implementation by the National Government. The internal structure is divided into four divisions: General Affairs, Guidance, Statistics, and Compilation. Except for the director and deputy director, who are to be appointed by the government, in view of the current national crisis and financial constraints, existing personnel will be redeployed to new positions. Zhao Shutong has been appointed as Secretary, Wang Shi'nai as Director of the General Affairs Division, Zhang Xianglin as Director of the Guidance Division, Zhu Xinong as Director of the Statistics Division, and Kong Shi'e as Director of the Compilation Division. Ji Zeyin, Zhou Boxiong, Wen Zhonglin, Gao Jun and others have been appointed as specialists in their respective divisions.</p>
<p>▲Operational Status Although the bureau has been reorganized, the director and deputy director have not yet been appointed by the government. During this transitional period, Mr. Guo, who is preparing the bureau, is temporarily supervising the secretary and the heads of each division to carry out various tasks.</p>
<p>▲Appointment of Advisors According to the provisions of Article 12 of the organizational regulations, experts and those with a well-established reputation in international trade or other economic undertakings may be appointed as honorary advisors. Mr. Guo has specially invited Ma Yinchu, Liu Dajun, Jiang Jingwei, Chen Da, Sheng Jun, He Guang, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Zuomin, and Tan Danya to be honorary advisors to the bureau.</p>

<p>Liu Wenhui, Chairman of Sichuan Province, telegraphed Wang Jingwei yesterday, saying: "Respected Mr. Wang, having read your telegram, I fear the indefinite delay of unification and am deeply concerned about the increasing urgency of the national crisis.

This is a grand strategy and a timely remedy. I cannot bear the pain of mutual drowning and dare not ignore the feelings of sympathy. I imagine that with a single call from a high place, all mountains will respond. We must achieve this on schedule and overcome difficulties together. Wenhui, residing in the remote western frontier, is mindful of the national crisis. Hearing your candid remarks, my sense of justice is expressed. I respectfully send this telegram to express my admiration, Liu Wenhui bows respectfully."</p>

<h3 id="e161">Lecture on Leprosy Prevention <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Women's Support Association of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held its regular meeting at the residence of its president, Mrs. Yan Fuqing, yesterday. Dr. Chen Mingkang, director of the Dermatology Department of the Women and Children's Hospital, was specially invited to lecture on the prevention of leprosy. He stated that leprosy was previously thought to be caused by poor food and sin, so lepers were treated cruelly. Later, Dr. Hansen of Norway discovered the leprosy bacillus, and it was learned that leprosy is actually caused by infection. The method of prevention should be to popularize public health knowledge and improve people's living standards. Early treatment should be given to early-stage cases, otherwise, there is a risk of infecting others, and the hope of a cure will be reduced. Therefore, establishing clinics to treat early-stage and non-infectious patients and constructing leprosy hospitals to accommodate severely ill and infectious patients are the most effective methods of dealing with leprosy. If lepers are unwilling to be hospitalized for treatment, and the utensils, clothing, and bedrooms they use are not mixed with others and they adhere to the principle of isolation, the risk of infection can be reduced.</p>

<p>▲Reported to the Municipal Executive Committee, Which Has Taken Legal Action</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association submitted a document to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department yesterday, stating: "Our association received your committee's order No. 782 on the 1st of this month, stating that the Harbor Quarantine Office has been ordered by the Ministry of Interior to temporarily suspend operations from November 20th. We hereby inform you, etc. Recently, according to members' reports, the Harbor Quarantine Office staff are using the excuse of active epidemic maps found in the Huangpu River to forcibly collect disguised disinfection donations, which is already a disregard for the law. They are even threatening to detain and impound ships, which is even more lawless. Even if it is true that there are designated hospitals for treatment, there is no need for the office to act on behalf of them. If this continues, all shipowners in the city will be in a state of irreparable ruin. However, no matter what, our association is determined to work with them. All members are asking your committee to investigate and take legal action, and provide assistance to maintain people's lives. If the office continues to act arbitrarily, causing accidents, it should be fully responsible. We hereby submit this document to request your committee to investigate and promptly order the National Harbor Quarantine Office to stop operations, and we are awaiting orders urgently."</p>

<p>Tian Huan, of the Central Party History Compilation Office, is a master of calligraphy and painting, a famous figure in Shanghai. People compete for his every inch of silk and paper. During the summer of this year, the authorities of Hubei Province specially appointed him as a member of the Hubei Flood Relief Committee to assist in relief efforts. In addition to initiating calligraphy and painting relief efforts, Mr. Tian also responded to the committee's request to sell calligraphy and paintings for a month to save the people affected by the disaster. For a time, those holding money and rushing to buy were numerous. Since the outbreak of the incident, Mr. Tian has been greatly indignant and has put down his pen. His works have been piled up on his desk. Recently, he began to organize them and gradually completed the task. According to reports, he raised more than 900 yuan in the shortest possible time and sent them to the Hubei Flood Relief Association in succession.</p>

In the past, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company operated telephones in the areas where roads were built across the border in western Shanghai, etc., based on the appendix to the contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company on December 17th, 14th year of the Republic. The contract term was five years, which expired on December 16th, 19th year. At that time, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities was carrying out the automatic telephone conversion project and expanding equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, and there was no supply plan for telephones in the above-mentioned areas. In fact, there was a great need for telephones in this area, and it was difficult to stop the supply. Therefore, it was suggested that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and the Shanghai Telephone Company, which succeeded the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, negotiate a temporary contract as a transitional measure before a long-term solution was determined. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and the Shanghai Telephone Company both agreed to the proposal, and the Bureau of Public Utilities drafted a temporary contract draft. After meetings and discussions, it was generally agreed. On October 23rd of this year, at the last conversation, the three parties formally signed and acknowledged the draft. Unexpectedly, two months have passed, and the Shanghai Telephone Company has not yet indicated when it can sign the official contract. There is no end to the number of residents in western Shanghai who need to add telephones. Because the contract has not been signed, there is no basis and they can only install and connect slowly. It is now known that the Bureau of Public Utilities has sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Company, setting a deadline of December 31st for formally signing the contract, and a written reply must be given before the 25th, so that the official contract can be prepared. If there is no reply after the deadline, the company will be deemed to have voluntarily canceled the temporary contract and waived the operating rights granted by the contract. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, urging the Shanghai Telephone Company to take action. Assuming that the company voluntarily waives these operating rights, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation will prepare to supply telephones to the western Shanghai area and complete the work on schedule, so as not to delay the convenience of citizens' telephone calls for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Municipal Council Will Ban Obstructions on Roadsides <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council, in view of the recent obstruction of roads and sidewalks by storefronts, tents, wooden cabinets, advertising boards, and other objects, causing inconvenience to pedestrians, has formulated the following regulations based on Article 23 of the Annex to the Public Concession Land Regulations: (1) Tents or parts thereof shall not be installed lower than seven feet six inches above the sidewalk or fifteen feet above the road surface; (2) No stalls or other movable objects shall be placed in front of any building so as to protrude into the sidewalk or road. These regulations will be implemented from January 1, 1932. Article 23 of the Annex to the Land Regulations originally stated: "Porches, verandas, awnings, push sheds, push windows, steps, cellars, cellar doors, and window awnings made of wood, iron, etc., signboards, window blinds, walls, fences, or any other protruding objects, whether built or placed, that are sufficient to obstruct the safety and passage of the road within the concession, the Municipal Council may notify the resident of the house to order the removal or reconstruction of the obstruction. The resident of the house shall remove or reconstruct the object within fourteen days after receiving the notice, in accordance with the methods indicated by the Municipal Council. If the resident delays in complying, the Municipal Council may impose a fine of not more than ten yuan and remove the obstruction, and the cost shall be borne by the resident and may be recovered according to the example of damages. However, if the obstruction was built or installed by the owner, the cost of removal paid by the resident may be deducted from the rent."</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Municipal Council Builds a New Garbage Incinerator <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The public concession collects approximately one thousand tons of garbage every day. How to dispose of this garbage is a matter of deep consideration. The methods of disposing of garbage in major cities around the world are roughly three types: (1) stacking in vacant land outside the city, (2) dumping into the sea, and (3) incineration. The public concession has always adopted the first method, but the land for stacking is limited, and the odor cannot be avoided, which is not a long-term solution. If the second method is used, transportation is extremely time-consuming. As for the third method, the cost is the highest, but it is the most hygienic. Recently, the Health Department of the Municipal Council investigated the situation of incinerators used in Europe and the United States. As a result, it was found that the garbage produced in Shanghai contains too few fuel components (such as waste paper and broken wood). Therefore, the existing incineration methods in various places are not applicable. After detailed research, it was decided that the Dur &amp; i type of incinerator from Germany and the Balmer type from the United States could be tried. Therefore, in July and October of last year, contracts were signed with the two companies respectively to build one each. In addition, because the nature of garbage in each district is also different, the Dur &amp; i type furnace was built on Binlang Road by the Suzhou River in the western district, and the Balmer type furnace was built on Maohai Road in the eastern district. These two furnaces are now nearing completion and will be available in the spring of next year. The Dur &amp; i type incinerator has two furnaces, with a total incineration capacity of approximately 240 tons every 24 hours. The Balmer type incinerator has an incineration capacity of approximately 134 tons every 24 hours. The ash remaining after incineration has been completely disinfected and will no longer attract flies. When the two furnaces are opened in the future, a new chapter will be opened in the new construction of Chinese municipalities.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Housing Dispute in Yixin Lane, Nanjing Road <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Yixin Lane on Nanjing Road have been illegally oppressed by the landlord and ordered to move out, resulting in litigation in court. The houses in this location are less than ten years old and are still new. When the tenants first rented, they painfully spent money on decoration, small rent, miscellaneous fees, etc., incurring no small losses, and originally hoped to live and work in peace. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, the landlord suddenly used high-pressure tactics to force them to move. The most painful issue for Shanghai citizens recently is the housing problem, and capitalists often only know their own interests, disregarding the public burden and acting arbitrarily. When this case was first heard, it was a local case, but it suddenly became a primary case. It is now reported that the court hearing will result in a declaration of provisional execution, causing widespread panic. In addition to jointly petitioning the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the relevant departments and bureaus, as well as the municipal party and government agencies, they are also requesting active assistance from various groups.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Two Fashionable Female Corpses <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Two fashionable female corpses floated to the shore of Gaohang in Pudong yesterday. One was about 22 or 23 years old, and the other was about 17 or 18 years old. Both had short hair and wore high-heeled leather shoes and black coats. Shen Guanlin, the local bailiff, salvaged them and investigated. It was learned that the slightly older one was Ms. Wei, the sister of Sun Zhixin, who lived at No. 3 Lane, Chengyi Lane, Carter Road, Avenue Joffre in the Public Concession and worked as an employee at the Bank of China. The slightly younger one was a teacher at Jiangwan Elementary School. It is said that her parents had betrothed her to someone in her childhood and were now forcing her to marry. She could not abandon her duties at school, so she asked Ms. Sun to act as her agent. It is unknown how she died by drowning. The female teacher may have committed suicide due to arranged marriage, but why did Ms. Sun commit suicide? It is puzzling. The case has been reported to the court for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Robbers Obey Teacher's Orders to Commit Robbery <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>▲Failure to Rob Will Result in Punishment by the Gang Rules</p>
<p>On October 4th, the robber Hu Xingsheng gathered four accomplices, armed with guns, to rob the house of Chen Qing at No. 9 Tongfu Road. They robbed gold, pearl, and diamond jewelry, etc., worth more than 4,000 yuan. Yu Wenjun, who lived in the same house, was also robbed of jewelry and cash, totaling about 600 or 700 yuan. Afterwards, they fled without a trace. After the victim reported the case to the police station, the police received a tip on November 25th that Hu Xingsheng was hiding at No. 285 Caishi Road in the French Concession, so they went to arrest him. Hu confessed that all the ornaments had been sold by Guo Shaoyun, who lived at No. 286 Kai'er Road, so Guo was also arrested. They were taken to the First Court of the Special District and interrogated twice. Because the stolen goods were being retrieved, the hearing was postponed until yesterday. First, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, and then the Chinese detective in charge of the case presented the recovered stolen goods. Then, Hu Xingsheng confessed that he went to rob with four people on that day, driving the victim into a side room and tying them with ropes before going upstairs to search. However, he went to rob this time under the orders of someone else. He had recently become a disciple of someone named A Gan, who ordered him to rob. He was unwilling, but several of his companions said that if he did not obey the teacher's orders, he would be punished by the gang rules, so he did not dare not go. Guo Shaoyun confessed that he was a pawnbroker, and Hu Xingsheng often came to pawn and redeem items, which is how they became acquainted. On October 6th, he brought valuable jewelry to pawn again. Because he thought the price was too low, he suggested that he sell it. Because he had no close friends, he introduced him to a Mr. Xu, who his companions often called "Young Master," so he never suspected that the jewelry had been obtained by robbery. At this point, the victim appeared in court and identified Hu Xingsheng as the robber who pointed a gun at him at the time. The court then ordered the debate to begin. After the debate was over, the judgment was scheduled for the 22nd of this month.</p>

<p>Reader's Letter</p>
<h3 id="e181">Mr. Shi Yucai's Message (International Situation and National Salvation Work) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our military authorities have been ceding the three northeastern provinces with the word "non-resistance." In terms of diplomacy, not only has there been no progress, but it has gradually turned into failure. Recently, it has been heard that the Yunnan-Guizhou Incident has broken out again, and the national affairs are becoming more dangerous every day. All nationals should rise up to save the country from ruin. Newspapers are the people's mouthpiece, the hub of public opinion, and the compass for the people's actions. Regarding national affairs, they should be responsible for propaganda externally and for criticism and guidance internally. Recently, your newspaper has been calling out for the country in distress, it can be said to be screaming with all its might. With patriotic sincerity, it issues tragic and fervent words, which are truly enough to increase the patriotic heart of the nationals. Yucai respectfully hopes that your newspaper and other newspapers will continue to work hard in order to awaken the compatriots of the whole country to engage in patriotic work to achieve the goal of resisting insults and saving the country. Also, according to what your newspaper published yesterday, Russia will make a serious expression towards Japan. Is this kind of expression superficially tough? The establishment of the Japanese Liaison Cabinet, and Arakawa, who has been living in Russia for a long time, taking office as the Minister of the Army, shows that he attaches great importance to diplomacy with Russia. In the future, he may secretly force Russia to compromise. I think that although the diplomatic relations between China and Russia should not be clearly restored at present, they should be secretly allied with Soviet Russia as soon as possible, and agree to attack Japan together. Moreover, the United States is rich in economic power. Although it often seems calm for the first half of the time, when it moves, its power will be strong. Russia very much hopes for a war between Japan and the United States, and the United States also hopes for a war between Japan and Russia. If Japan and Russia really fight, our country should immediately declare to the world on the surface that China and Russia are acting separately. In this way, China and Russia will be in a de facto cooperation without formal cooperation. Furthermore, Japan and France's secret collusion has gradually been exposed. France is adjacent to Germany and Italy, and was once allied with Russia, and is a long-standing enemy with Britain and Germany. At this time, our country should seem to connect with Germany in order to restrain France. As for Italy, its people are rich in patriotic ideas, so they can stand among the strong countries, but the lack of minerals is indeed a shortcoming of a strong country. However, it is precisely because of this that they are forced to make efforts to develop abroad. I vaguely recall seeing a report a few months ago about the Italian Prime Minister visiting Germany, but I do not remember the details very well. Although the visit is a common etiquette, it actually contains political significance. What is the current international situation after all? According to the current international situation, how will the Second World War proceed? Before the outbreak of the war, our country should work hard on national defense and recover lost territory. When the war starts, our country should take independent action. However, at the appropriate time, our country can also assess the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the strength and weakness of all parties, and formally participate in the war accordingly. Is this an appropriate way? I hope that you will appreciate my eagerness to learn about national affairs and teach me in detail. Also, the National Crisis Conference was produced because of the national crisis and should be realized as soon as possible. It should not delay and waste time, or still follow the official style, fooling people and fooling oneself, then the national affairs will be even more hopeless. I sincerely hope that your newspaper will work hard to call out and awaken the authorities, so that the National Crisis Conference will be realized as soon as possible, and an early determination of the direction to lead the national people to work hard in national salvation. However, before the National Crisis Conference is officially convened, it seems appropriate to issue the following matters to the whole country, (1) Notify all sectors of the country that, given the dangerous environment the country is in, all should put aside their grievances and adopt a spirit of perseverance and decisiveness, and act in unity to save the country. (2) All sectors, agencies, and groups across the country should do their duty. (3) All sectors of the country should practice frugality and, starting from a certain date, stop entertainment for a few days. (4) Designate a certain day for the whole country to be silent for a few minutes, but instruct the national military and police circles to pay attention to local security during this silent period. In this way, the acceleration of the national patriotic work will be influenced and tend towards the actual, and there will inevitably be no small impact on the international community. I pray for your bright teaching.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your letter's speculation on the future changes in the international situation is very accurate. However, based on recent observations, the relationship between Soviet Russia and Japan has not yet reached a serious stage. The future of the East Asian situation is entirely dependent on the economy. The prior and later changes of the British and Japanese monetary systems on the gold standard have significant international impact. In short, with nations standing side by side, any action is entirely based on self-interest as a prerequisite. If it is beneficial to plan, it may not be willing to be the head of the war. Your letter said that China's interest lies in the battle between B and C, and country B's interest lies in the battle between A and C, which is extremely true. The country in the past period was too hopeless. Although we are now through this difficult time, we have only to quickly put politics on track, and at the same time establish a rational and effective economic political symbol, with increasing production and controlling consumption as the only goal. The whole country is of one heart, opening up a path to life from the most dangerous and extremely dangerous. Opportunities are all in front of us, I only fear that we will not use them.</p>

<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>The county town of Nanhui was built during the Kangxi period of the early Qing Dynasty. Its former site was the Nanhui Guard city. It was built by Qi Jiguang during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty to defend the coast against Japanese pirates. Qi lived in the city, in the house where my friend Xie Rong-sheng now resides. The house is not very large, but its style is very ancient. Fifty years ago, Xie's respected father, Mr. Yanxiang, acquired it from the descendants of Qi at a low price. Yanxiang was good at painting flowers, no less than Bai Yang, and was as famous as Gai Qi Xiang. After moving in, he hired craftsmen to renovate it, and the bright windows and clean tables were completely renewed. When the work was completed, he shared his calligraphy with his closest friends in the art world, enjoying himself. However, whenever there were continuous rainy days, strange noises would come from inside the roof ridge. Xie, who was always stubborn, did not think it was strange. One night, he invited friends to drink in the study, and talking about the past, some advised him to move. Xie casually responded. Amidst the wine and candlelight, the sound came again, exactly like the sound of a kite string. The guests were alarmed. The next day, Xie called a craftsman to dismantle the corner of the house and suddenly discovered an ancient sword. The decoration was ancient and elegant, and the blade was extremely sharp. The handle was inlaid with silver wire and had the small seal characters "Qi Jiguang." Only then did he realize that the sword was making a dragon's roar. The locals heard of it and were fortunate to see it. I don't know if it is still treasured. I should ask Rong-sheng when I have time. The following year, relations between China and Japan deteriorated, and the smoke of war suddenly rose. The land and sea forces were defeated. Could it be that the divine object knew and made an uneasy sound in advance? I record this to show the undiminished power of General Qi.</p>

<h3 id="e185">On the Edge of the Circle of Survival <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Human society is like a circle. I call this circle the circle of survival. Some people live safely in the center of the circle, called people at the heart of the circle of survival. The rest are crowded on the edge of the circle, called people on the edge of the circle of survival.</p>
<p>What are the people at the heart of the circle of survival? What are the people on the edge of the circle of survival? This can be distinguished by the clothes they wear.</p>
<p>The clothes worn by people at the heart of the circle of survival are not only complete for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, but there are also several sets of clothes for each of the twenty-four solar terms that exactly match the season. Moreover, there are clothes for the morning, clothes for the afternoon, clothes for the evening, raincoats for rainy days, dining clothes for eating, bathrobes for bathing, and pajamas for sleeping. One person's wardrobe can fill a house. In the past, when Kang Youwei spent the winter in Xi'an, Liu Zhenhua asked him what fur coat he wanted and could arrange it. Kang Youwei picked up a pen and wrote down seventy-two pieces of all sizes. Whether he got these seventy-two fur coats is unknown, but this list represents the ambition of someone who wants to be at the heart of the circle of survival.</p>
<p>Last night, a young friend and I passed the entrance of a small pawnshop and saw someone bring a package of clothes to pawn. We went in with him to take a look. The shopkeeper opened the package of clothes, and they were all summer clothes. They were pawned for a total of five yuan. He then took out a pawn ticket, and the shopkeeper calculated that it would cost four and a half yuan. He gave the five-yuan note to the shopkeeper, who found a coat and handed it to him, and gave him fifty cents back. He put the coat on his body and the fifty cents in his pocket. This fifty cents is probably his food expenses for tomorrow?</p>
<p>A moment later, an old woman wearing a lined coat, shivering with cold, brought a cotton-padded coat to pawn, and got one and a half yuan. This old woman and her children at home had not eaten anything for two days. Unable to bear the hunger, she had to pawn her cotton-padded coat to buy rice to feed her children. But although she took care of her hunger tonight, who knows if she will not freeze to death tomorrow?</p>
<p>This old woman and her children are struggling on the edge of the circle of survival, and if they lose their footing, they will fall into the grave! Have those people who live comfortably at the heart of the circle of survival felt the inequality of this world?</p>
<h3 id="e186">Biography of Mr. Zhao of Ningling <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Quchang</p>
<p>Zhao of Ningling, whose name is lost. A dwarf with long arms. Had great aspirations. Liked to talk about military affairs. Read the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan. Uniquely admired Yang Youji. So he practiced archery. Able to hit people from a hundred paces away. Never missing once. The world was then revering Western firearms. Mr. Zhao viewed them as if they were nothing. Once, he obtained a carved bow from an ancient tomb. The spine had inscriptions, all in worm script. If readable it would say, "Born, same achievement. Dead, same heroism. Three thousand years, resting in the soil. Alas, oh bow." Mr. Zhao treasured it as his life. Never leaving his side. Some spoke of the benefits of firearms. Mr. Zhao looked up and said loudly, "How can they match my bow?" One skilled with firearms arranged a shooting competition. Mr. Zhao hit the target ten times out of ten. The shooter of the firearm did not even reach half. Mr. Zhao was all the more pleased. In the twentieth year of Guangxu, the Japanese affair arose. Mr. Zhao held his bow and generously asked to join the army. The high officials laughed at him for being pedantic. Did not respond. He also spoke of strategies for attack and defense. Also no response. Thereupon, was greatly angered. At that time, Liaoyang had already fallen to the enemy. Mr. Zhao secretly went there. Impregnated arrows with poison. Hid in the thickets every day. Sniped at the enemy. Coming and going fleetingly. Killing hundreds and tens. Ultimately unknown whence the arrows came. Upon hearing of the peace treaty and the cession of Taiwan, Mr. Zhao was all the more angered. He waited for the enemy leader, one Ooyama Iwao. Shot two arrows. Missed. Killed his guards to the left and right. Thereupon, was captured. Starved himself to death. Nearing death, still hoarsely calling, "My bow!"</p>
<p>The Outsider Historian says: In times of national crisis, bravely going to the enemy is only a matter of adapting to righteousness. It is not necessary to calculate the advantages of instruments, the differences of strength and weakness, the count of success and failure. Knowing righteousness, Mr. Zhao's single bow could annihilate a strong enemy. Not knowing righteousness, then millions of soldiers are not enough to guard an inch of soil. Those in the world who compare strength and weakness and calculate success and failure are all petty, forgetful of righteousness, mediocre, and cowardly men. How can petty, forgetful of righteousness, mediocre, and cowardly men plan for the country? But the world only</p>

<p>Men plot together. This is why Mr. Zhao died. Alas. Alas. What time is it now? Are there also those who have heard of Mr. Zhao's character and are plotting for themselves?</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Economy of the Northeast and the Interior <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>A few months ago, Japan held a Manchuria-Mongolia Exhibition in Tokyo. The purpose was to encourage its people to invade and seize our Manchuria and Mongolia. On December 12, the Shanghai Education Bureau held an exhibition of patriotic activities of various schools. The aim was to alert the academic community and think about striving to save the country. The meeting lasted for three days. On the last day, Zhang Ke-wei, a member of the Northeast Transportation Committee and a German doctor of economics, was invited to give a lecture on the economic problems of the Northeast and the interior. His words were mostly pertinent. The following is a summary of what he said:</p>
<p>Japan's implementation of the invasion of the Northeast did not start with the September 18th Incident this year, but began with the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Before the war, the forces in the Northeast all belonged to Russia. After the war, they fell to Japan. From then on, the Japanese Association studied the colonial problem of the Northeast day and night. Operating on the immigration to the Northeast. However, the Japanese people regarded the Northeast as a fearful place. Hesitant to move forward. Even today, due to the direct and indirect relationship with the South Manchurian Railway, the number of Japanese who have moved there is still less than 200,000. It is enough to see that Japan's invasion of China is not for survival, but for the pursuit of wealth and enjoyment. This is evidenced by the statistics of a certain British person. He said that Japan in 1880 and today has indeed seen its population grow day by day. Only the rate of increase in production is several times higher than the increase in population. The Japanese people advertised to the world, claiming to be under pressure to survive and to develop colonies. This is a deceitful statement. This is a self-deceiving statement.</p>
<p>The Japanese people are unwilling to reside in the Northeast, while the people of our country's interior are happy to go to that land. More than a million people go there every year. One after another. This is because natural disasters and man-made disasters are forcing them to do so. The production of these million people can at least support 4 million people. Japan can still survive without the Northeast. China can hardly survive without the Northeast. The seriousness of the Northeast problem is beyond words. Not only that, but our country's international trade has a trade deficit of 400 million taels per year. The exchange of Northeast products with the interior offsets a surplus of 300 million taels. Once the Northeast is no longer ours, then the total peacetime trade deficit will be that our country will lose 700 million taels per year. China today has already felt that the four peoples are unemployed and all the people are haggard. The pain of the future when the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted will be doubled. It is like we can get three bitter meals today. After losing the Northeast, even one and a half meals a day will be difficult to guarantee. Therefore, the Northeast issue is the entire issue of the country. May the people of the country think about it deeply.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Gao Junshan Returns from Europe and the United States to Talk about National Crisis (1) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Ms. Gao Junshan. In the summer of the year before last, she traveled to the United States again. To continue her studies at Columbia University, her alma mater, for two years. She left the United States this summer. Traveled in Europe to observe the new trends in modern education in various countries. When she first arrived in Geneva, it was when Japan forcibly occupied my Liaoji provinces. It was the most tense moment of the League of Nations. Ms. Gao attended the meeting many times. Personally heard the representatives of various member states express their great theories. And the magnificent spirit of my country's chief representative Shi Chong in negotiating the agreement. Therefore, she has a deeper understanding of the League of Nations' position and the attitude of various countries towards my Northeast problem. She has recently returned to China. It is said that for the sake of the national crisis. Unable to bear the fragmentation of the motherland's mountains and rivers. Eager to take the road. Unable to follow the planned European tour. I regret it very much. Yesterday, I happened to meet the reporter and asked about his feelings on this trip. Cheng happily told me. Rambling talk. Quite insightful. Now summarized into three questions. (1) Should students in our country participate in politics? (2) Dissection of the League of Nations' lack of equality. (3) The reason why our country cannot immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. The following is a special introduction.</p>
<p>Most American students take a very calm attitude towards politics. For example, when reading newspapers. They don't pay much attention. Even if they read the newspaper, it is limited to sports, movies. Science……。 And do not pay attention to political news. Not only elementary and middle school students. College students are also like this. This is in the reading room of Columbia University. A conclusion I have carefully observed. Perhaps people who have served in society and are older. Relatively pay attention to political news. Female students like to watch. That is even less. Because they have little interest in politics. So I don't care much about this issue. It can be said that I don't like to read political news. It is a sign of weak political awareness. They not only do not participate in domestic politics. Also rarely pay attention to international issues. In fact. The speech in the American newspaper. Absolutely free. Discourse. Record. Naturally, it is fully developed. The authority of the newspaper is great. As a rule. Everyone likes to read it. Moreover, American students are not unpatriotic. There is certainly a reason why they don't care about politics. According to my speculation. Perhaps it is because domestic politics is clear. Whether it is domestic affairs or diplomacy. They are all the public servants of the people. 丨丨National civil servants丨丨 are fully responsible. Since the people are very trusting. There is no need to supervise at any time. Or because of geographical relationships. The United States is located between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. There is no domestic turmoil. There is no invasion of neighboring countries. The people can live and work in peace. Students can study diligently. So political concepts have also been diluted.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Europe. I also observed it with the same eyes. And the college students in various countries. Obviously different. Newspapers are almost one for everyone. Especially paying attention to political news. I think there are many political changes in various European countries. And the location. Very different from the United States. Strong neighbors are eyeing. Border defense is important. Disputes often occur. This kind of fact. It is easiest to stimulate students' patriotism. So daily necessary reading. Should not be ignored. Maybe that's the reason. If you compare our country's students with American students. That is very different. Almost all students above junior high school in our country pay attention to reading newspapers. Pay attention to the news in politics. The more the country is in trouble. The more you want to read the newspaper. The more corrupt politics are. The more you want to participate in politics. For example, now that the national crisis is urgent. The government's response is wrong. Saving the country and protecting the people. When there is no way. Students can no longer study with peace of mind. You can no longer tend to interfere with one of the political issues.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Going on an Expedition <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— A member of the Youth Aid-to-Ma Army Corps</p>
<p>(2) Leaving Shanghai</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang told us. Now "good men want to be soldiers." I deeply understood Jiang's instructions. So. I didn't care about anything. And resolutely went on an expedition.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th. We marched out of the North Station in the grateful cheers of the Shanghai people. There were many people watching along the way. It's like watching a lantern festival. But. Some women sadly shed tears.</p>
<p>More than a hundred Shanghai volunteers. Sent us all the way to Zhenru Station. When they went back. They said goodbye to us very sincerely. They said. "Dear young comrades. We're going back for now. I hope you stand on the front line and bravely kill the Japanese slaves. Recover the three northeastern provinces. We will follow you soon." When they said this. Their eyes were full of tears. Ten out of ten in our team were also sobbing. My old friend Qian Yingjun. He was the saddest. He actually burst into tears. I advised him. "A real man bleeds but does not weep. Why be as knowledgeable as women." However. Under this tragic situation. It will indeed make people extremely sad.</p>
<p>In Zhenru. We are hosted by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Dada College. Living in the Science Museum. Meals are also provided by them. It is said that their students donated to various restaurants. I didn't ask them. I don't know for sure.</p>
<p>On the 8th. We spent the whole day doing military training on the Dada playground. Have not moved forward. Because Commander Zhang wanted to go to Shanghai to send a telegram to General Ma. And contact the rear affairs. At the same time, our cadres must also be reorganized. Work is very busy.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Righteousness Obliterates Kinship</p>
<p>The two escaped from the tiger's mouth. They traveled day and night to T City. By this time, the news of the fall of S City had already spread throughout the city. It was known that the Sun Army had occupied S City. All the mortar factories, aircraft factories, and arsenals were seized. The essence of the Northeast was utterly lost. They aided the enemy with the spoils of war. A great golden city was handed over without a fight. Hua Naiqiang couldn't help but cry out loud. Zhongshu comforted him, saying, "These strong armor and sharp weapons are usually only used for personal gain. They were never meant to defend the borders. Why are you crying about it? If our people can sincerely repent and make a comeback, then flattening the three islands will be nothing. Otherwise, crying is useless." Then Zhongshu led him to see her father, Peng Meiguo, and reported their escape. Meiguo was very happy to see his beloved daughter return safely. He also showed Hua Naiqiang some courtesy. From then on, Hua Naiqiang stayed at Peng Meiguo's residence. However, reports of the Sun Army's military operations kept coming. They occupied the Y trading port. They bombarded Gongzhuling. They burned and looted somewhere. They advanced on somewhere. Aircraft dropped bombs and bombed trains. These many ominous warnings were all transmitted to Hua Naiqiang and Zhongshu. The two of them were almost boiling with rage. The Sun Army didn't have many troops. How could they have such a sweeping momentum in the Northeast in just a few days? Alas, the suffering only added to the misery of the common people. Hua Naiqiang said to Zhongshu, "T City is a vital point on the TA railway. The Sun Army has wolfish ambitions. They want more than they have already gained. I expect they will covet this place soon. I wonder if your father is planning and commanding from his position. If they come, what kind of measures will he take to resist? Or will he not resist?" Zhongshu frowned and said, "Brother Naiqiang, I am ashamed to say that my father is usually incompetent. Moreover, he is old, focused on wealth and status, and addicted to pleasure. He has no courage like Lian Po or ambition like Ma Yuan. Although he has more than 10,000 troops under his command, they are all the troops of Basha and Jimen, lacking combat power. How can they know how to love the country and the people? Recently, my father has gathered several officers every day to discuss in secret. I don't know what methods they have. From what I see, there are no fortifications for defense. How can we resist the Sun Army if they come? When I ask him, he always says that military matters are not for women. He promises to keep you safe. It's really hateful to talk about it." Hua Naiqiang couldn't help but sigh and said, "Then my staying here is also meaningless. In the past, Ban Chao joined the army and went deep into the tiger's den with thirty-six men, beheading the heads of various kings and establishing unparalleled achievements. Now I have only a patriotic fervor. Where can I serve?" At this time, tears welled up in Zhongshu's eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Soaring Financial Gold Prices <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲Rumor that the National Government will lift the gold ban</p>
<p>▲Soared more than twenty-eight taels</p>
<p>▲Large buyers actively covering short positions. Yesterday's gold market underwent significant changes again. In the morning and midday, prices fluctuated around 640 taels, but in the afternoon, they advanced courageously, once briefly reaching 670 taels, which was quite unexpected. The market sentiment was excellent due to the rapid price movements. However, a difference of a few taels is not unusual. The total daily difference was more than 36 taels, with a sharp increase of over 28 taels in the final count. Large buyers were actively purchasing, and short sellers were quickly covering their positions. The slight rise in the silver market had no impact. The opening price was slightly lower, but later, due to the apparent easing of foreign exchange rates, although there were foreign firms settling accounts, the banks' attitude was neutral. The price fell from 445 taels to 345 taels. Subsequently, the bid and ask prices of various firms differed, causing the price to fluctuate. By noon, the price was above 40 taels. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the National Government would lift the gold ban, which further boosted market sentiment, and the price soared to the sky, advancing by more than 20 taels. Buying enthusiasm was high, with both Guang-bang and a certain bank actively competing to purchase. However, the exchange rate for bills did not rise significantly, leading dealers to arbitrage.</p>
<p>▲Morning Hesitation. The February opening price was slightly lower by three candareens, at 640.5 taels. Silver bullion added 3/8, forward 5/16, silver price added 3/8. However, due to the closure of several banks in the Americas, the US-to-UK exchange rate fell, and the UK-to-US exchange rate rose, reversing the previous day. It then fell from 41 taels to 38.5 taels. Suddenly, Ri Chang, Qian Changxiang, and retail investors entered the market, settling USD 34.3125 to .375 for British-American tobacco companies. China Bank quickly absorbed .25 and then added to 45.5 taels. As US dollars were difficult to sell, HSBC bought .4375 and then offered .375. Before long, half a yuan was acceptable in both directions. Yuan Mao, Yong Qian, Changxiang, Heng Yu, and others sold, weakening the market considerably and dropping by more than 10 taels to 34 taels by 9:30 AM. At that time, Bing Xing and others bought slightly, and the price rose again to 38 taels. The London gold price was listed as increasing by .25, and the US dollar by five dimes. The price then retreated to 36 taels. In an instant, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Hong Kang, Yong Heng Xing, Yi Feng, Yuan Cheng Yong, and others came to buy, and banks absorbed USD .375 to .4375. HSBC absorbed near-term GBP 11 9375, causing the price to return to 45 taels. At 10:00 AM, the price was 40.5 taels, momentarily dropping to 36 taels as retail investors sold. At 10:30 AM, Ri Chang, Chun Yuan, Yong Sen, Chang Yong Tian Feng Yong, and others bought, hedging with GBP .8125. Japanese merchants absorbed USD .4375, bringing the price to 43 taels and five candareens at 10:45 AM. Rumor had it that Mr. Wu was selling, and Da Xing Yong Fu Yu Tian Feng Yong Yu Da and others followed suit, with GBP being particularly strong, the spot price at 2/0625 shillings and USD 34.625, causing panic and a plunge of 8-9 taels to 35 taels by 11:15 AM. Subsequently, the market gradually stabilized as Heng Yu, Ri Chang, and hedgers followed. The Indian exchange rate fell by four annas, rebounding by more than six taels to 41.5 taels, closing at 41.2 candareens in the afternoon and then rising to 4 taels. Retail investors covered short positions, with the listed price revised to 716 taels, down 80 to 745 taels.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Increase. The market opened in the afternoon at 46 taels, reflecting the momentum of the afternoon close. It then rose to 55 taels. Afterwards, it rose sharply as large buyers such as Mr. Wu actively purchased, immediately rising to 54 taels and five candareens. After 2:30 PM, foreign merchant Qiao Rifu sold, and various firms sold continuously. As the exchange market was flat, it weakened by 3-4 taels. Then, due to Mumbai's rebound of six annas, the price was 49 taels and six candareens at 3:15 PM. There was slight consolidation afterwards. After 3:40 PM, Heng Xing Da Xing Yong and rumors of certain banks vigorously competing to purchase were rampant. Due to rumors that the central government would abolish cash exports, market sentiment was high, and short sellers quickly covered their positions, causing the price to jump by more than 20 taels in half an hour, reaching 70 taels and two candareens at 4:20 PM. As the exchange rate for bills was still flat in the near term and tight in the forward market, Anda and others sold March US dollars at $33.875 as the market approached the close. Then, Tong Taichang and others sold, retreating to 68 taels. Suddenly, the price rose to 9.5 taels, closing at 68 taels and eight candareens at 4:30 PM, a sharp increase of 28 taels compared to the previous day. The situation was complex and difficult to handle, and drastic changes were expected in the following days. The daily high was 70 taels and two candareens, and the low was 34 taels, a difference of 36 taels and two candareens. Merchandise opened at 39.5 taels, closed at 41.5 taels in the afternoon, 5 taels and eight candareens in the afternoon, and 66 taels at the close. The initial listed price was 70 taels, and afterwards 467 taels, 40 taels less than on the 7th. The net increase was 14 taels and five candareens. It was said that the northern supply was continuous, but demand was limited.</p>
<p>▲Transactions at various firms were extremely chaotic. On the exchange floor, transactions were complex. Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Xing, Yi Feng Yong, Ri Chang, Shun Li, Hong Kang Yong, and Yi Feng were all net buyers. Tong Taichang, Fu Tai Heng, Da Xing Yong, and Qian Changxiang were net sellers. Yuan Tai Heng, Da Kang, and Tian Feng Yong fluctuated. Zhi Feng Yong bought before selling. Da De Cheng sold before buying. In the afternoon, Heng Xing, Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Da Xing Yong, Tong Chun, Yuan Chun, Yi Feng, Hong Kang Yong, and a certain bank were all net buyers. Qiao Rifu, Yi Feng Yong, Tong Taichang, Shun Li, and Ri Chang were all net sellers. Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Changxiang, and others bought and sold repeatedly. The Dalian gang sold a total of more than 1,000 bars, buying 8-900 bars. The Guang gang bought a total of 4-5,000 bars. Speculator Mr. Wu sold and then bought, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Foreign Exchange Weakened Then Strengthened <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>▲GBP and USD Spot Rates Ease, Forward Rates Tighten</p>
<p>▲Hedgers Squeeze Spot Rates, Gold Dealers Arbitrage</p>
<p>▲US Merchants Settle Accounts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the GBP, USD, and Indian silver markets all reported rises, driven by buying activity. Exchange rates moved in the opposite direction to the previous day, with the GBP-USD rate falling to 3.4475 and the USD-GBP rate rising to 3.46375. The USD-JPY rate rose by 0.5 to 43. HSBC's listed rates yesterday were higher, with GBP (25) at 1/11/25 shillings, USD at 0.5, and HKD unchanged at 75.5, with all other rates higher. Internal rates appeared weak initially, then strengthened, weakened again at noon, and improved in the afternoon. However, the improvement was not as strong as in the gold market. Both GBP and USD spot rates were weaker than forward rates. The result was that compared to the previous afternoon close, the GBP was slightly higher by .0625 and the USD by .25, due to the larger fluctuations in exchange rates. The gold market was unusually volatile due to the collapse of foreign banks and rumors of domestic cash easing, which fueled market excitement and pushed the price to 670 taels. Chinese gold dealers initially sold and then bought back due to the squeeze on spot rates from hedgers, resulting in a small arbitrage of only 40 taels. It was reported that US tobacco and oil companies settled USD 2-300,000 at prices between 34.3125 and 375.

<p>▲The Unification Customs Tax for January Alone Falls by One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (17th), the situation of various bond markets at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange: spot trading became more active, and there was a lot of trading in the Unified Salt Tax, etc. The futures market was lively, and various parties invested and bought at the morning opening, and prices continued to rise sharply compared to the previous day. Afterwards, except for the 20 Customs Unified Salt Tax, etc., which gradually lowered due to large accounts selling, several other bonds continued to strengthen after the morning opening, and the rest also maintained a firm and strong state. However, the trends were quite peaceful. As a result, compared with the previous day, such as the demobilization and disarmament of the current month and the 20 Customs, and the current month of the 19 Good, etc., rose by nearly two yuan, and others also rose by several angles to more than one yuan. The spot price of the whole six soared by 2.9 yuan, and the spot price of the 19 Customs rose by 2.1 yuan. Only the salt tax fixed the 20 Customs Unified Tax for January, which fell by one yuan. The bond market situation can be described as good. Although most people are still watching, if there are no other twists and turns in the future, the market price seems to be expected to continue to strengthen. The total spot trading volume was 83,500 yuan, and the futures volume was 5.08 million yuan in the morning and 3.57 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 8.65 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly tired. Due to the many national affairs and the tight financial situation, it is difficult for actual demand to be smooth and prosperous. People's hearts are plain and uninspired. However, sporadic transactions from the Sichuan gang are still uninterrupted, and the market can still be firm. However, the overall situation is calm, and most retailers are bearish. Fortunately, the bottom goods are not thick.</p>
<p>▲People's Biao Slightly Lower in the Afternoon. The People's Biao opened in the early market, with American cotton being flat, and the market situation was soft. Each month rose or fell by 1-3 cents. In the afternoon, the market suddenly tired, and each month fell by 25-6 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,800 bales. It was found that Tong Yu sold 700 bales, Hou Feng 400 bales, Yuan Tai 550 bales, and De Ji 700 bales. Rong Xing bought 750 bales, Tian Jiang 600 bales, and Ming De 550 bales.

<p>February 1529 4 66,600 May 1538 1 32,500</p>
<p>▲Yarn Sales Still Not Bad. The current yarn sales are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 475 bales for the day, and 60 bales were entered among the same industry. The market was flat. The guest gangs entered 100 bales from the inland, 265 bales from Sichuan, 25 bales from Shantou, 35 bales from Jiangxi, and 40 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Recent Cotton Prices Decline <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending downwards, and the situation is showing signs of shaking again. The prices of foreign cotton are flat and tired, and the gold price is short. The silver market for foreign cotton procurement is becoming cheaper, which has cut off the demand for local cotton everywhere. Moreover, the arrival of goods in Hankou is gradually increasing. Therefore, the seller's attitude is stable, and the scattered ones are showing slight signs of unease. Fortunately, the Hankou and Ningbo gangs are not moving, and the situation is still flat. However, the near month has already fallen.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Biao Scattered More Unstable. Hankou Biao opened flat in the early market, with each month falling by 5 points. In the afternoon, the gold price was heard to be trending downwards, and the market atmosphere suddenly loosened. The near month fell by 3 cents, and the far month fell by 5 points. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,400 dans. It was found that Yuan Da sold 4,000 dans and Xin Cheng 1,000 dans. Geng Feng bought 3,100 dans, Yu Chang 1,000 dans, and Rui Yuan 1,100 dans. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>▲Factory Demand Cut Off. Factories rarely inquire about local cotton because foreign cotton is particularly cheap and completely invades it. 111 bales of Yao cotton arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Foreign Cotton Generally Firm <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to inter-dealer purchases, then tired due to Wall Street weakness, and finally firm again due to short covering. Futures rose 1-3 points, and spot was unchanged. British cotton futures rose 5-8 points, and spot rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. Indian cotton was firm due to a lack of Omra and speculator purchases. Pingguoer rose 4 rupees, Omra rose 7.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (16th telegraph):</p>

<p>▲Nantou: Yesterday, there were about 30 sources. The storage in the port is still strong, and the shops in urban and rural areas are bland. Due to economic reasons, various industries are unwilling to lend accounts, and the intake is even more deserted. The transaction is similar to the previous one. Although the selling households have seen the production price rise repeatedly, it is difficult to develop temporarily according to the market situation. They have to get rid of it at any time, so that the market of Houxin japonica rice has been trimmed again. The arrival of thin rice is limited, and the selection of high-quality slightly moves and softens by 5 points. Yangdu's sharp goods are sold rarely, and the price is temporarily stable without ups and downs. ▲Xinzha: There are not many sources, and the river storage is gradually thicker. The shops in urban and rural areas are also deserted because the weather is turning cold and it is heard that the South Market is cheaper. The market of Xixin japonica rice has been shortened again. The arrival of early and late rice is even more scarce, and the guest gangs have no entertainment at all. The prices continue to decline, and Yangdu's sharp arrival and sales are flat, without honor or disgrace. The sales of Bianyin Yuan are still active, and the price is similar to the previous market.</p>

<p>▲Hankou Continues to Buy Over a Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: the situation is still inferior, there is no entry or exit of futures, and the spot rice is also dull. However, the cargo owners are quite willing to depreciate the price for sale. Yesterday, Anli Foreign Firm sold 3,500 bags of small-grain rice, and traders sold 500 bags. The price was only 9.12 yuan to 9 yuan, which was 1-2 angles less than the previous market. This caused the local customers to intervene. Hankou Gang also transacted more than a thousand bags. 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon were handled by the local street, with prices ranging from 11.05 yuan to 10.8 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Flour Market Subjected to Environmental Pressure <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲ Buying to Cover Short Positions After Initial Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market once again showed signs of sluggishness in the morning. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell by about three or four "jiao" (a unit of currency), some people became uneasy. Moreover, due to the upcoming settlement for the current month, many outside speculators wanted to close their positions. Therefore, under the pressure of the environment, the market value for the current month reached a low of 1 tael, 8 qian, 0 fen, and 2.5 li (units of currency). This market value is a new record for the past 35 years. The prices for forward months also generally decreased by about one fen. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, the initial opening was still not good. Subsequently, because short sellers were eager to cover their positions and it was rumored that the standard flour of the Fu and Fu factories had been completely purchased by merchants from other regions, leaving only flour from smaller factories, market sentiment improved and rebounded by more than one fen. As a result, the current month improved by 2.5 li, January decreased by 2.5 li, February decreased by 7.5 li, March and April remained unchanged, and May decreased by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Futures Wheat Afternoon Buying Interest Increased <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>▲ Result: Near Months Stable, Far Months Soft</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market generally showed a flat and weak trend in the morning. The current month had little price fluctuation because short positions were not being delivered and long positions had stopped. The prices for January, February, and March were unstable due to the quoted price of foreign wheat, decreasing by two or three fen compared to the previous day. There was little fluctuation for April and May. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, it was also very flat initially. Later, because the flour market became stable, buying interest also increased, and the near and far months improved by one or two fen. However, observing future trends, there will be no improvement due to the poor gold market. As a result, the current month improved by 2 fen compared to the previous day, January improved by 1 fen, January decreased by 1 fen, February and March decreased by 3 fen, and April and May decreased by 2 fen.</p>

<p>Recently, woolen cloths and fabrics are still selling well, especially melton cloth. Merchants from other regions are all interested in purchasing it. Dark blue is particularly popular, and the selling price has fluctuated several times. The recent market prices are indeed slightly cheaper than the standard prices. As the end of the year approaches, many holders are eager to sell their goods, and the selling prices are falling accordingly. The sales of dark blue melton cloth have become even more active as a result. Yesterday, dark blue melton cloth from Hua Ji was sold for 2 taels and 0.075 fen. Hua Bo, Ning Feng, and Bao Ke sold for 2 taels and 0.05 fen. Second-grade cloth like that from Shun Quan Long, Li He, and Jin Bao Long was wholesaled for only 1 tael and 8 qian, after commission. Cloth in its original color was even cheaper by several fen of silver. All brands were priced uniformly.</p>
