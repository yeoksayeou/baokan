<h3 id="c18">世界列國其注意日人之暴行 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>日政府對於解决此次武力犯我之暴行的方針。一爲暴行之發動出於自衞二爲善後交涉由地方解决不與我中央政府折衝。三爲由日本與我東北單獨交。涉解决。不願第三國置喙。四爲此係突發事件。將與满蒙諸懸案分别交涉。綜上四項而觀前兩者爲宣傳暴行之引起。乃由於我國之挑釁。而且爲地方事件。無若何嚴重之性質。後兩者則爲欲憑此暴　。攫得我東北之完全主權或完全保護權。實現其一貫的大陸政策。是非倒置。將欲以一手掩盡天下人之耳目。以逞其野心大欲。其蔑視非戰公約與國際聨盟。蹂躪公理與正義。於斯蓋已達至極。</p>
<p>夫所謂自衞之戰。必爲對手方已先有武力侵略之舉動。而且此種舉動已實際侵入另一方之領土。今日人所謂自衞。究何所指。我方自始迄今。絶無武力挑釁之表現。所謂中村事件。與炸毁南满路軌。姑無論其事屬誣架。即有其事。日外交官何爲者。正式以外交手段相折衝。何事不可正當解决甩突然實施武力發動。儼然以敵國相對待。佔據者爲我國土殘殺者爲我軍民而我方仍終始力持鎭靜忍辱負重。遠引退讓。誰爲禍首。誰爲挑釁自衞乎抑有計劃的對我襲擊乎。事實具在。世界列國。應都共見。次之。兩國交涉。已達武裝襲擊。佔據城市換易國旗。設置官吏。以征服相對待。事態之嚴重尚有甚於此者耶而猶曰此爲「地方事件」性質并不嚴重。不必與中央政府交涉更不必第三國干預。然則何者乃爲非地方之事。何者乃爲應歸　中央政府交涉。日人之避重就輕。陰謀辣手。當更爲世界列國所共明。至於日人謂此次突發事件。將與满蒙諸懸案分别交涉。夫地已佔領。民已殘殺。暴軍四出如瘋如狂。憑此暴力。何求而不可得。日人固已提出要求擴大南满日司法權行使範圍。確保各種旣得權。满鐵並行線由中日合辦。敷設吉會路。厲行關税協定諸主張矣。果如日人所要求者。則我東北將無疑義的淪爲日人之保護領土。日人之所宣稱者爲自衞。而所要求者則爲取我東北而握諸已手。世界列國其勿爲狡言所朦蔽。當以銳利之眼光。照破日人之陰謀與隱匿。我方急難。救死不暇。日人乃乘我之危。下落井之石。直接屠殺我東北軍民。間接殲滅我中土災民。蹂躪公理。不仁不義。實爲全人類之罪人。抑且永貽人類歷史以不可磨滅以恥辱。尤有進者。查非戰公約明文規定。第條「締約國代表各該國人民鄭重宣言。反對用戰爭以解决國際爭執。並否認在各國相互關係中。以戰爭作國家政治之工具。」第二條。「各締約國承認凡締約國間一切紛紛及爭執。不問其起因及性質若何其處理及解决。概不得用和平方法以外的方法。」非戰公約本爲美所發起者。中日兩國都已正式簽字。承認該約之有效。而今則何如日人茲已實施和平方法以外之方法矣。質言之。已决然破壞公約矣。信誓猶在。破壞一旦公約是否能維持其威信。是否能繼續發生效力。同盟國之國家。此後是否能共守公約。當全繫於此次日人暴行之如何裁制。如何創懲。如何解决。又國際聨盟揭舉兩大目的。爲增進國際互助保障國際和平。聨盟會議呼籲和平。口血未乾。而今則又何如。日人一面派員參與會議。一面實施破壞聨盟之精神。使聨盟前途。頓爲之黯淡無光。聨盟今後。是否能繼續維封其地位。是否不致令參加各國失望。亦全繫於對日人此次暴行之如何處置。總之。日人此次暴行。非中日局部問題實爲世界嚴重問題日人乘西方多事之秋急起推進其傳統的大陸政策。證之歐戰時期。突然對我提出二十一條。前後如出一轍。勃勃野心固已虎瞰全球中國危難。世界亦從此多事矣。維護公理與和平之世界列國其注意日人之暴行。其注意日人危害世界之暴行</p>

<p>路透二十一日紐約電紐約銀行界稱、英政府停止金本位法一舉、乃暫時緊急所促成之建設辦法、美國聨邦儲備銀行與摩根公司近所借與英國之債欵、訂明用美金償付、故不受影響、而與英國在美所發行之美金債欵、亦無關係、衆料英國銀行當道將仿德國辦法、管理外幣匯兌、當英政府决議之消息傳到此間時、證券經紀人頗爲震動、但重要銀行家則謂此事在美影響甚微、因美國所結存於倫敦之短期欵項、遠不若在柏林之多、估計不過五千萬元耳、</p>
<p>路透二十一日東京電東京證券交易所據英國停止金本位之消息、頓起恐慌、立即停市、大阪交易所雖未即停、但價極大跌、旋亦停市、財相聲稱、日本等國或不免受間接影響、但日本無恢復金禁令之需要、戰後日本金賬、已由倫敦轉至美國、故渠預料日本財政可免直接影響云、</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>海灘上的珍物英國有好幾處沿海岸的海灘。可以覓得大批的寳石。雖不是希世的珍品。然而瑪瑙與黄寳石。也不是尋常之物。却時時會發現在海灘上。使人不勞而獲。最近泊立毛斯。Plymouth地方的主敎。供獻神壇上的掛燈一套於當地的聖安特魯敎堂。St.AndrewsChurch嵌有美麗黄寳石四十八顆。據說全是一位女敎友從海灘上拾來的。伊最初只拾得四十顆。交與那製燈的人。問他可用不可用。製燈的人先打了一個圖樣。却見這四十顆不夠分配。須再添上八顆。那女敎友聞名之下。忙又到海灘上去。經了一禮拜的搜尋。果然如願以償。</p>
<p>英國東海濱一帶的沙灘中。常可找到猩紅的琥珀。據說是一路從波羅的海Baltic冲上來的。靠近蘇格蘭幾條大河的口。有許多採珠人採集貝殻中的珍珠。所得很多。那珠子旣大且美。爲婦女們所歡迎。因此獲得極大的利益。</p>

<p>— 王明鑫</p>
<p>近來中日交涉。日見緊張。日本軍人。更公然高倡武力解决。其心目中無中國。無國際正義。可以概見。我國雖本息事寗人之旨。事事忍辱讓步。然日人得寸進尺。相逼不已。蠻横不可理喻。備戰之聲日亟。識者早料其無好結果。今果悍然不顧公理。於十八日晩十時半武力佔據我遼寗省城。更肆其野心。沿南满線向我各地國軍開始砲擊。其事先有組織。有預備。不問可知。衝突原因。及我當局如何應付。姑置不論。茲將十九日吳淞路日本人之舉動。陳述於下。不知國人觀此。此何感想。</p>
<p>日本電訊宣傳素以敏捷稱。衝突既起。我國人多數尚在夢中。而吳淞路日本每日新聞社。於晨五時即在大門旁高揭戰報。印發號外。至十一時。已有七電露佈。大字標題曰中日軍大衝突。十八日午後十時半。開始攻擊北大營。（爲東北軍駐軍之所·建築雄壯規模之大·甲於全國·能容二十萬人）·至十九日上午半時。完全佔領。三時掃除商埠地。六時半遼寗城完全佔領。城内外中國軍人巡警武裝完全解除云云。同時吳淞路較大日商店。均由該社分發同樣戰報。張貼門外。置身其中。宛如戰塲。國人見之者均憤憤不平。而日本人則面現笑容。驕氣凌人。各人心内之急度緊張。隨時有發生衝突之可能。但一逾吳淞路至大馬路福州路。則熙熙攘攘。一如平時。毫無感覺。國人之麻木不仁。於此可見。歸後憤不能平。特記之以告國人。願速猛醒。</p>
<h3 id="c71">葉園一日記 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 湯花</p>
<p>自江灣葉園開放後。余久思一游。卒因事冗未果。十九日爲該園舉行籌賑各省水災游藝大會之第一日。余遂撥冗往游。至則車水馬龍。盛極一時。游客擁擠。摩肩接踵。蓋皆熱心士女。至堪欽佩。爲江灣路上未有之盛况。茲將會中花絮。略誌如後。</p>
<p>余因初蒞葉園。未諳途徑。入門時幸有童子軍分贈地圖。遂得按圖索驤。一覽無遺。園中層巒疊翠。别有洞天。尤以伏虎嶺·潛龍池·紫竹林·小天台·柳浪聞鶯·奇峯揷雲諸景爲最佳。他如小羅浮·琉璃閣·晴濤橋·湖心亭等處。亦引人入勝。如蒞仙境。</p>
<p>此次因園中築有四丈九尺之天壇。特請江西龍虎山六十三代張天師追祭災魂。一般游客。爭欲一覩天師廬山眞面。其號召魔力。可謂大矣。天壇用竹木紮成。圍以黄布。高矗雲表。上懸八卦大旗。飄摇空中。入晩。電炬齊明。如同白晝。園之四周。满懸燈籠。五色繽紛。益增光輝。游藝節目。不勝枚舉就余所知者。爲永義影片公司全體演員表演話劇「災慘」。劇情悲哀。賺人眼涙。尤以李昌鑑君李麗王桂秋二女士演來聲涙俱下。異常賣力。時台下有某君竟向台上抛擲銀餅五番。鏗鏘作聲。於是一呼百諾。紛紛解囊。旋由司事者偕某游客作證。將所獲之錢。投入募捐筒中。於此可知戲劇感人之深矣。演畢。該公司經理趙詠霓君表演頭頂打鐵。驚心動魄。嘆爲觀止。</p>
<p>冠生園特在園中出售麵點。據洗冠生君語余云。將售得之欵。酌提若干。以助賑災。又晤錢化佛君。爲該會發起人之一。連日抛棄繪事。佈置會塲。據云此次會期共計五日。游藝節目。逐日更換。晩間並放燄火。燃河燈云。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3 id="c72">甘地與太戈而之生活談 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 雲山</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>警頑先生召集「午餐談話」。與其盛者。雖不盡天下之選。然皆來自四方。亦難得也。計有新近偕孫夫人回國之胡闌畦女士。由日本返國之陸晶清女士。昨日由京來滬之立法院女委員陶玄女士。及申報記者周瘦鵑黄寄萍兩先生。余則爲月前歸自西藏印度者。警頑屬胡女士談孫夫人之生活。囑余談甘地與太戈而之生活。談畢。周先生復命筆記之。以補「自由談」空白。此非爲文。聊供談資而已。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>甘地先生之瘦骨裸身光頭赤足之照像。國人已見之多矣。其「瘦」比瘦鵑先生之「瘦」。自有過之。而無不及也。由其瘦骨裸身光頭赤足之照像。亦即可想見其生活。</p>
<p>先生原爲富貴子。但現在則無所謂財産。亦無所謂家室。其夫人兒子。皆隨之奔波無定。席不暇暖。以從事民族革命與改造國家社會事業。衣料皆自紡自織。而少鏠裁。暑時。僅下身圍以布。寒時。再上身披以巾。無論行至何處。皆携紡車與俱。印人晋見者。均易衣「甘地衣布」。從未有穿西裝着洋服者。即歐美人士往見。亦如之。飲食簡單淡薄。食品以羊乳蔬菜爲主。殺牲吃肉。是所絶戒。</p>
<p>平居。每在早上四時起身。臥具爲木床草褥。或不用床。即在地上。潄浴後。即與徒衆朝會。誦詩唱歌靜默祈禱。日中除辦公見客外。輙紡紗看書寫文章。早晩六時左右。均作村外散步。每禮拜一日緘默。不發一聲。藉資休養。有事。用筆談。作手式。是日即名爲「緘默日」（SilenceDay）。但紡紗看書寫文清理函牘等工作仍如常。總而言之先生生活。可以「刻苦」二字作包括。先生生於一八六九年。今年六十有二歲。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>太戈而先生以詩人哲學家名於世。夫人而知之矣。但先生尚不僅爲一詩人哲學家。且爲一音樂家圖畫家。换言之。即一完全的藝術的詩人哲學家。而先生之生活。亦即藝術的詩人哲學生活先生之家室。比甘地先生更爲高貴。其祖與父。皆印度一代聖人。先生則更進而光大之。先生老家在加爾各答。但多居於聖地尼克坦（Santiniketan）國際大學之新構私産。建築優美精巧。亦甚偉大。形似珊瑚。余曾有詩四句以詠之。</p>
<p>「一座珊瑚形。此是詩人屋。但願詩人吟·多詠貧民窟。」</p>
<p>先生衣食。亦甚儉樸。雖不如甘地之自作紡織。但所衣皆印度産品。西裝洋服。視爲恥辱。食物以牛乳糖果蔬菜爲主品。但肉食不戒。四時早起。即作禱告。爲世界求和平幸福。日出之前。作戶外散步。一年三季。（印度天氣分三季）寒暑無間。日中功課。看書作詩之外。輒作文作晝。手中不停書筆。飯食間亦置書身傍。晩間時召男女生徒。歌唱其所爲詩曲。聲音溢於四外。洋洋乎盈耳焉。新理成篇。輒作講演。聲音瞭亮。如黄鍾大吕。平常見客。多在下午四時以後。春冬之時。歐美名流。不遠萬里而來。一瞻先生丰采者。絡繹不絶。</p>
<p>先生生於一八六一年。今年正七十歲。統括先生活。則可以「快樂」二字包之。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>上略談甘地與太戈而兩先生之生活既畢。吾尚願贅一言。即吾人生此娑婆世界。應願天下人人之生活活皆如太戈而。但吾人自我暫時之生活當學甘地。</p>

<h3 id="c73">丈夫的妻子（二十） <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>陳先生心裏有些跳，肺量特别膨漲，比平時是很不自然，他手裏的茶杯，在顫動，他前面除了李夫人以外，不曾見些什麽，和飲酒過度的微醉一般，恍惚着，他不明白這是怎麽一會事；他更模糊着，自己是否有婦之夫，伊是否有夫之婦？這樣的情形，是否合理？他只覺得伊的美，伊的温柔，伊的可憐，伊的性情意志，都與他相合，伊不拒絶他的殷勤是一件寳貴事件。他更覺得惟有伊才是他的知己，决定把伊當作理想的戀人或妻子。</p>
<p>「我託你的事，已探聽到了没有？」李夫人在兩人沈默了好久，先開口問陳先生。</p>
<p>「我很抱歉，至今没有去探聽呢。但是我以爲關於這一件事，你最好不要知道，知道了，徒然多煩惱，不是我屡次勸你的歷？」陳先生坐在伊身旁，伊側轉身子讓開一坐給他坐下，他們身子已靠得很緊了。</p>
<p>「我自問是一個女人，氣量總没你們男子大，我不信天下的女子，會有不探聽伊丈夫和其他女子的情史的。那天汽車裏的女子，一定是他的戀人無疑。」</p>
<p>「我妻子這幾天常和他一起走，也許伊可以知道一些。」</p>
<p>你不願帮我，也吧了；怎麽你常拿這句話來向我說呢？我老實說，你夫人常和我丈夫看電影上跳舞塲，我便不很贊成。」</p>
<p>「你疑心他們也有暧昧麽？」</p>
<p>「假使你是一個女子，你的丈夫和他朋友的妻子這樣密切，你會不會疑心？」</p>
<p>「那麽我從明天起，便禁止伊再和李先生往來，你可以满意麽？」</p>
<p>「我不是這個决思。我曾聽見有人說過，文章是自己的好，老婆是别人的好。這可以代表一般男子的心理，你是否承認？」</p>
<p>「我現在很難立刻答復你這句詁，我只覺得夫婦的結合，在初期是情感較多，初期以後，雙方都因爲負着一種義務，情感便減少，這也是很普通的事實。因爲情感的交錯，是一種犧牲精神，義務是一種商業性質，多少有些討價還價論斤估兩，稍爲差了一些質量，便會發生爭執，或發生怨恨，我在未結婚時候，只理想着夫婦同居的生活，是完全甜密而合作的；結了婚以後，才知道夫婦的關係，是這樣一件麻煩的事。所以我想男女有感情而發生戀愛，不必要結婚，永遠和朋友一般的來往，才不會發生義務，没有義務，便少了許多煩惱，並且彼此都自由。」</p>

<h3 id="c155">現代養鷄事業的發展 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>莊瑞清</p>
<p>養鷄在現代已成爲科學化的事業發、而有極驚人的進步和發明、因爲現代養鷄不如從前副業式的小規模飼養、而有極大的組織與計劃了、并且在鷄羣的管理和飼養上、没不有一定的法則和規程、甚至於鷄舍的用具等等、也確是大翻新樣、有新奇的製作和創造、至若講到鷄病的預防和治理、孵化的進行和手續、配種的交配和登記等等、則更有高深的學理和研究、所以這種科學化的養鷄事業、誠所謂「聞前人所未聞了、」</p>
<p>我們要知道養鷄之有若是發展原故、還有一個很重要的因由、就是從前蕃殖鷄羣的方法是用天然孵化（老母鷄孵化）、現在則進爲巧奪天功的人工孵化法了、（即機器孵化）這個發明我們可以認爲是促進養鷄事業發達原動力、而且也可以認爲是養鷄事業的科學革命化、把從前一切不進步的養鷄方法、加以根本的改良和發明、</p>
<p>人工孵化法的發明、本來始自西歷一五四○年、有法人法蘭西氏愛者（FrancigＩ·）始創爲自動孵卵機、其後逐漸改良、乃有現在熱水和熱氣孵化機的發明、上圖爲美國簡米氏𠳿最新煤爐孵化機（Jamesway）能一次孵卵二至三千枚、孵化機的最高孵孵卵數量、在美國貝克涯公司（BuckayeCo）所製的煤爐熱水孵化機、已有一次能孵卵六十多萬枚的報告、在中國上海江灣德園所製的自動孵化機、也能一次孵卵三至四百八、又據我們的經騐、機器孵化的雛鷄、確不遜於天然孵化、而且據他兩方面的優點比較下來一看、人工孵化的雛鷄、只要飼養得法、往往能比天然孵化的强健、所以人工孵化法的發明以後、一方面是促進養鷄事業的發展、而另一方面則無異是將天然孵化淘汰於失敗的地位了、（人工孵化的雛鷄、是用人工保姆器保姆、）</p>
<p>人工孵化的發明和進步、我們雖已大略地明瞭、但仍應將養鷄的利益所在了解、才能促醒人們的注意、與希望同胞們一致努力於養鷄事業的發展、而謀生産上的增加、以減少一般失業或無告者的痛、進而言之、若使養鷄事業將來能擴展到「農村化」的地步、則中國目前農村經濟形將奔潰的危險、或可因養鷄生産的增加而有相當的挽救、所以我們對於養鷄、不但應認他爲「時代的生産事業」、而且還可稱之爲「生活恐慌的大救星」、或「貧窮無告的救濟者」、</p>
<p>我們若想要明瞭養鷄的利益、須先知道養鷄在現在營業界綫上的分劃、今代養鷄業的營業界綫、可概分爲三種、（一）種鷄、（二）卵用鷄、（三）肉用鷄、經營種鷄利益的標準、是要看他所養種鷄的産卵紀錄如何而定、譬如在美國養來克亨（Leghorn）種鷄的鷄場、著名的有何李五（Holywood）和漢森（Honson）等、但何李五的每隻種鷄價、普通爲美金五百元左右、）合華幣二千元左右（、而漢森則僅數十元美金而已、（合華幣二百元左右）、這就是因爲何李五鷄的産卵紀錄比漢森高的原故、（何李五鷄每年每隻約産卵三百三十枚、漢森僅産三百枚而已、所以經營種鷄的利益、是要看他能否改良多産鷄種而定、換言之、就是說假如你有高深的學問和經騐、能夠造成一種多産的種鷄、（或各種標準鷄）、那麽你就能夠因社會的信仰、而獲數倍的利益了、</p>
<p>（二）産卵鷄、經營這種鷄業的人、大概以養來克亨鷄爲最多、因爲來克亨已成爲世界上著名的産卵鷄、每年最低能産一百五十枚卵左右、即如德園的鷄、每年已達到二百平均數的成績、所以在德園每鷄每年産卵的贏利、已約有二元之譜、（德園産卵鷄、因飼料較好、每年每鷄約食三元六角飼料費、每蛋值洋五分、以二百蛋算約值十元、除人工開支而外、故有利二元之譜、）</p>
<p>（三）肉用鷄、養肉用鷄的人、大概以養大種鷄如巴拿馬（Brahrna）交趾鷄（Cochin）、或中國的大種鷄爲多、因爲這種鷄的體格碩健、肌肉豐嫩、在售賣上、人們樂於購買、且巴拿馬鷄由小至育肥期（育肥學名詞）、所食不過一元四角左右、而肉重則有九至十二磅之譜、故其利益、不問而知有一倍以上了、</p>
<p>養鷄的利益、吾人旣已明瞭、則余甚願全國同胞、一致努力於養鷄的發展、而謀生産上的增加與個人生活恐慌的救濟、今謹述個人對養鷄業的發展意見如下、以供國人的參考、</p>
<p>余今正計劃相當資本、回川在渝開設鷄塲、而目的則在改良四川的鷄種和宣揚養鷄事業的發展、余計劃改良鷄種推廣的步驟有二、（一）雛卵交換法、即俟鷄塲發達後、每年用大號孵機孵雛若干、而令鄉人持五至十枚中國鷄卵來換來克亨雛一枚、如是鄉人必樂於交換、而來克亨種也自當能迅速地推廣了、（二）散養收利法、即每年分發若干雛鷄於農民、不取雛價、而每年只令其繳還十至十五枚鷄卵用作食卵售出、以歸成本而已、</p>
<p>在此吾人應須注意者、即來克亨種、余絶對不主張與中國鷄行「雜種改良」、所以鄉人繳回之蛋、不論其是否原種蛋、因其飼養和配種不盡合法、故一概不能作爲孵化推廣之用、而只好作爲食卵售出罷了、鷄的改良成功、是須吾人數十年的心血專門飼養才果成功、來克亨鷄已經過若干年代的改良而成爲一種産卵的標準鷄、吾人自當養此種「純種」鷄而爲改良中國鷄種的單位鷄種、自無須照一般人所主張的「雜種改良」的弄巧思想了上述的幾個意見、是余推廣改良鷄種的主張、更希望以後能有政府力量的帮助、則中國的鷄種、正不難在數年間統一化的改良了、</p>

<h3 id="c159">膠錫的敗市丘斌存 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>邇來因爲世界經濟起了恐慌、影響了膠錫原料供給地的南洋發生了巨大的不景氣、現在樹膠在國際上的市價、每担仍然不過十三四元、錫礦的市價、每担也仍然不過四十元而已、膠錫價值的復活、猶在漫漫長夜的境况中、一線光曙、未知何時方能實現、而謀救濟的方法、尤爲當前先急的要務、故更草此膠錫的敗市與失業華僑的救濟、以與關心南洋僑務者一再商榷之、</p>
<p>（一）膠錫敗市的原因</p>
<p>在未說膠錫的敗市之前、應先來說它的敗市的原因、膠錫敗市的原因、是由於生産過剩、</p>
<p>例如英屬馬來亞各地去年九月份所産樹膠的總額及入口出口的總額、百畝以上膠園的産額爲二二·一七二噸、百畝以下膠園的産額爲一七·七七二噸、合計爲三九·九四四噸、由外國入口六·六七</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>八噸、由馬來各邦入口一五·二八二噸、出口至外國四九·九八二噸、至本地一五·二八噸、現將該表列下、</p>
<p>馬來亞九月份樹膠産額及出入口</p>
<p>地名産額噸數入口出口</p>
<p>馬來各邦百畝以上膠園百畝以下膠園由外國由馬來各邦至外國本地</p>
<p>馬來聨邦　一三·一九八　一○·○七八　五一六·三八四六·○二八</p>
<p>柔佛　三·九八四　三·一一六　一·二○○六·二一三</p>
<p>吉打　二·二三三　九四六　一·○六五二·三四一</p>
<p>加央　　　　七　五　九</p>
<p>吉靈丹　三六三　三○四　一　七九　五○一</p>
<p>丁加奴　一二七　一九○</p>
<p>總計　二二一七二　一七·七七二　六·六七八一五·二八二　四九·九八二　一五·二八</p>
<p>其他樹膠出産地如荷屬東印度等的統計表、我手裏惜没有收到、否則必有驚人的數目、所以路透電訊稱「倫敦及利物浦十月份初的存膠、已增加八百四十一噸、合前此之存膠、足供全世界七個月之用、」過剩的生産、可說是很巨大了</p>
<p>錫的供給地、如馬來亞、玻璃維亞、荷屬東印度、尼基亞等地、所産生的錫礦、與樹膠同樣陷於過剩的命運、恕我這裏不更再詳述了、</p>

<h3 id="e18">The World Powers Should Pay Attention to the Atrocities of the Japanese <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese government's approach to resolving this violent act of armed aggression against us is as follows: First, the outbreak of violence was in self-defense; second, the aftermath should be resolved locally and not negotiated with our central government; third, the matter should be resolved solely through negotiations between Japan and our Northeast, without the intervention of third countries; and fourth, this is a sudden incident that should be negotiated separately from the various pending issues in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Looking at the above four points, the first two are propaganda to claim that the violence was caused by our country's provocation and that it is a local incident with no serious nature. The latter two are attempts to seize complete sovereignty or complete protection of our Northeast through this violence, in order to realize its consistent continental policy. This is putting the cart before the horse, trying to cover the eyes and ears of the world with one hand in order to fulfill its ambition and desire. Its disregard for the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations and its trampling on justice and righteousness have reached their extreme.</p>
<p>The so-called war of self-defense must be based on the fact that the opponent has already taken armed aggressive actions and that these actions have actually invaded the territory of the other party. What exactly does Japan mean by self-defense today? From beginning to end, our side has shown absolutely no signs of armed provocation. Regarding the Nakamura incident and the bombing of the South Manchuria Railway track, regardless of whether the matter is fabricated, even if it did happen, what are Japanese diplomats for? They should formally negotiate through diplomatic means. What matter cannot be resolved properly? Instead, they suddenly carried out armed aggression, treating us as if we were an enemy country, occupying our territory, and brutally killing our soldiers and civilians. Yet, our side has remained calm from beginning to end, bearing humiliation and burden and retreating and yielding from afar. Who is the culprit? Who is provoking self-defense or a planned attack against us? The facts are there. The world powers should all see them.</p>
<p>Secondly, negotiations between the two countries have reached the point of armed attacks, occupying cities, exchanging national flags, and setting up officials, treating us as conquered territory. Is there anything more serious than this? Yet, they still say that this is a "local incident" with no serious nature, that there is no need to negotiate with the central government or to have third countries intervene. Then what is a non-local matter? What should be negotiated with the central government? The Japanese's tactic of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial and their insidious and ruthless plots should be further clarified to the world powers.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese saying that this sudden incident will be negotiated separately from the various pending issues in Manchuria and Mongolia, the territory has already been occupied, the people have already been killed, and the violent army is running rampant like madmen. With this violence, what can they not get? The Japanese have already demanded the expansion of the scope of the Japanese judicial power in South Manchuria, ensuring various vested rights, joint Chinese-Japanese operation of parallel lines of the South Manchuria Railway, construction of the Jilin-Huining road, and strict implementation of tariff agreements. If what the Japanese demand is fulfilled, then our Northeast will undoubtedly become a protected territory of the Japanese. What the Japanese claim is self-defense, but what they demand is to take our Northeast and hold it in their hands. The world powers should not be blinded by cunning words and should use their sharp eyes to see through the Japanese's conspiracies and concealments.</p>
<p>Our side is in dire straits, unable to even save the dying. The Japanese are taking advantage of our crisis to throw stones down the well, directly massacring our Northeast soldiers and civilians and indirectly annihilating our Chinese disaster victims. They are trampling on justice, being inhumane and unjust, and are truly sinners against all humanity. Moreover, they will leave an indelible and shameful mark on human history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Kellogg-Briand Pact clearly stipulates in Article 1: "The High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another." Article 2: "The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means." The Kellogg-Briand Pact was originally initiated by the United States. Both China and Japan have formally signed it and recognized the validity of the treaty. But what about now? The Japanese have now implemented methods other than peaceful methods. In other words, they have resolutely broken the treaty. The oath is still there, but the treaty is broken in an instant. Can the treaty maintain its authority? Can it continue to be effective? Whether the countries of the Allied Powers can abide by the treaty in the future depends entirely on how this Japanese act of violence is restrained, punished, and resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, the League of Nations upholds two major goals: to promote international cooperation and to ensure international peace. The League of Nations' call for peace is still fresh, but what about now? The Japanese are sending personnel to participate in the meetings while implementing actions that destroy the spirit of the League of Nations, making the future of the League of Nations dim. Whether the League of Nations can continue to maintain its position and whether it will not disappoint the participating countries depends entirely on how this Japanese act of violence is handled.</p>
<p>In short, this Japanese act of violence is not a local issue between China and Japan but a serious global issue. The Japanese are taking advantage of the busy season in the West to rapidly advance their traditional continental policy. This is reminiscent of the time of the European War, when they suddenly presented us with the Twenty-One Demands. The overweening ambition is already eyeing the globe. China is in danger, and the world will be in trouble from now on. The world powers that uphold justice and peace should pay attention to the atrocities of the Japanese and their atrocities that endanger the world.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang arrived at Xiaguan on the Yongxiu warship at half past one in the afternoon on the 21st, landed at the Sanbei Pier, and was greeted at Jianggan by Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Gu Zhenglun, Wu Siyu, and others. After entering the city, Chiang went directly to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to rest. At 4 PM, Song Ziwen, Wang Zhengting, and others went to the mausoleum to meet with Chiang and discussed the atrocities of the Japanese army in the eastern provinces. At 6 PM, Chiang invited the central committee members in Nanjing, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Bulei, and others to gather at the mausoleum to discuss how to deal with the atrocities of the Japanese army and the telegram from Guangzhou. The meeting had not ended by late evening. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing on the Yongxiu warship, a reporter asked for his opinion on the Shenyang Incident. Chiang replied that Japan took advantage of our natural disasters and suddenly used military action to forcibly occupy our Shenyang and Jilin areas. Its barbarity and peculiarity are truly unprecedented in the international community. The nation cannot bear this major insult, and the people should engrave it in their hearts and take unified steps with the government to save the country from its difficulties. When the reporter asked whether Mr. Hu Hanmin would return to duty, Chiang replied that this was a matter of course. The party comrades should unite and serve the country in this national crisis. Not only Comrade Hu, but all disciples of the Premier should actively take responsibility and jointly take on the great difficulties. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Various Declarations Released <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>League of Nations Key Figures to Start with Investigation</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations is currently closely monitoring the Manchurian Incident. As far as the League Council is concerned, if it sees the need for swift action, it can take very swift action. However, the most difficult thing is that there is still no complete official report. It is hoped that the official report can be obtained on Monday. According to key figures of the League of Nations, if the Japanese army's occupation of Shenyang was sudden and the Japanese government had not heard of it beforehand, it is hoped that Japan will immediately withdraw its troops, and then the League Council will select diplomatic representatives of major powers in the Far East to form an investigation committee to resolve the matter in cooperation with the Chinese and Japanese governments. Currently, Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji and Japanese representative Yoshizawa have both issued declarations at the Council. (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) There has been no official statement regarding the Japanese troops' occupation of Shenyang and other places. The Chinese and Japanese representatives are currently keeping silent. The Japanese representative has received a detailed report on the Manchurian Incident, which has been sent to the League of Nations Executive Council for private viewing, but is not allowed to be announced to the public, reportedly for the sake of a satisfactory resolution of the matter. Both sides do not want to exacerbate the seriousness of the situation. The Chinese representative has not yet received formal instructions from Nanjing. The Japanese representative seems to want to wait for the Chinese representative to act first. There will definitely be developments in the next few days. According to news from Nanjing, Foreign Minister Wang plans to notify the League of Nations and the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact about the Japanese army's unprovoked aggression. Although a Washington dispatch stated that the US State Department believes that the news from Manchuria has not yet made it possible to recognize the Shenyang Incident as an act of violating the pact, it is still questionable whether the steps taken by the Japanese military authorities do not violate the pact against using war as an instrument of national policy. However, if the Kellogg-Briand Pact cannot be met with a positive response, it is necessary to hope that the League of Nations will come forward to mediate. However, the League of Nations' ability to provide assistance cannot but make people doubt. German newspapers have already criticized that the League of Nations will disappoint people as usual. Russian and German newspapers have criticized the Shenyang Incident the most. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Karakhan met with the Japanese ambassador today to discuss the Manchurian Incident for a long time. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An American said that even if China refers the case of the Japanese atrocities to the League of Nations, it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory results. The League of Nations is mediation-oriented, not adjudication-oriented. This time, the Japanese side is cunning, attacking by order of the commander of the Kwantung Army to avoid the responsibility of declaring war. The League of Nations stipulates that when two countries are in a state of war, mediation should be done first. Yesterday, the League of Nations inquired of the Japanese representative, who said that this matter should be limited in scope. However, in reality, the Japanese army in Jilin has resumed its offensive. The Japanese representative is deceiving China again and deceiving the international community with this argument. Regardless of the Japanese side's vigorous defense that it is not declaring war on China, Japan has in fact implemented a state of war. Occupying famous cities on land and water in two provinces with tens of thousands of troops in two days and nights, and saying it is not war, who would believe it? The signatory countries have clearly understood that the responsibility for starting the war lies with the Japanese side. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

The entire battalion of the guard regiment was disarmed. The Japanese army immediately occupied the station and telecommunications agencies. In addition, the camp defense of the Jilin Infantry and Artillery Road Army stationed in Nanling near Changchun was completely destroyed by the Japanese army, killing more than 20 of our Chinese soldiers. On the afternoon of the same day, the Japanese army advanced and occupied Kuanchengzi Station, tore down the Chinese and Soviet national flags, replaced them with the Japanese flag, injured Chinese workers and Russian ticket clerks, and detained the railway staff in a room. In addition to issuing a statement to us, the Russian consulate has protested to the Japanese consulate. Currently, the military and political authorities in Harbin are doing their best to maintain law and order and have notified the Japanese Acting Consul-General Nakano, informing him that there are many Japanese residents in Harbin and requesting that he restrain them from causing trouble without reason.

<p>(Tokyo) People close to the Japanese government expressed pessimism about the Manchurian Incident today. Japanese cabinet members have admitted that the warlords have usurped the government's power to manage Sino-Japanese negotiations. It is heard that the Japanese government does not want the League of Nations to interfere in the Sino-Japanese dispute and does not want to handle this case by invoking the Kellogg-Briand Pact, as both China and Japan are signatories to the pact. (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The situation in the South Manchuria Railway Zone is currently stable, but people in Tokyo all admit that there may still be developments in the future. As far as Tokyo is concerned, the military authorities do not understand the cabinet's decision not to expand the incident, meaning to stop the advance of troops, but still expand military operations. The cabinet has greatly divergent opinions on this matter. The meeting was held from morning to discuss whether to continue sending troops to Manchuria, and no decision has been made so far. However, according to newspapers in Dalian and Shenyang, a mixed brigade of Japanese soldiers gathered in Shinyiju has boarded the train to prepare to go to Shenyang. The first train has already departed in the morning. Tokyo has not been able to verify this news. Many believe that the actions of this army have not been authorized by the government.

<p>(Nanjing) At 1 p.m. yesterday, the three chiefs of the army held a meeting at the Army Minister's official residence. Army Minister Minami, Chief of Staff Kanaya, Inspector General of Education Muto, Vice Minister of the Army Sugiyama, and Vice Chief of Staff Ninomiya attended the meeting to discuss the Shenyang Incident. As a result, the final policy was decided as follows: (1) Efforts must be made to prevent the expansion of the incident, but taking active action for the sake of military security is inevitable. (2) Continue to occupy key areas until the day the incident is resolved. (3) The root cause of the incident is that the various pending issues in Manchuria and Mongolia have not been resolved. If these pending issues are not resolved, such incidents will inevitably occur frequently. Therefore, it is decided to continue to occupy various places until they are resolved. (4) When the situation in the Jando area is urgent, the mixed division and other brigades waiting for orders in Shingiju will be sent to Jando, and the Korean army will be sent to Manchuria. If the Korean army is weak, a division from the mainland will be transferred to Korea to replenish it. In addition, Army Minister Minami requested Prime Minister Wakatsuki's understanding of the results of the meeting of the three chiefs before the cabinet meeting was held today.

<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Newspaper Circle's Support Association for Negotiations with Japan cabled Shi Zhaoji of the Chinese delegation in Geneva on the 21st to be translated and forwarded to the League of Nations, stating that Japan has dispatched troops without cause, occupied key areas in the three northeastern provinces, detained and killed our local officials, disarmed our troops, burned our public and private houses, and massacred the majority of our good people. Japan's atrocities this time have completely trampled on the League of Nations Covenant, the Washington Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We are peace-loving people, people who abide by international treaties, and there are floods raging across the country and rampant Red bandits.

<p>The London Manchester Guardian commented on the Manchurian Incident, stating that the overall situation urgently requires international action, which should be taken by the League of Nations to peacefully resolve the issue, because the Japanese government has unfortunately forgotten to take this action itself. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian newspapers have remained silent on the South Manchurian Incident. The government organ has commented slightly on the Japanese army's invasion and occupation of Shenyang and the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies, stating that the Soviet Russian newspapers have long been aware of the emergency in Manchuria, and the outbreak today was expected by everyone here. The Soviet Union can only adopt a wait-and-see attitude for the time being and wait for its development. The tone of Pravda is the same, insisting that the Soviet Union has no reason to change its neutral policy today, because Japan also strictly adhered to neutrality during the Sino-Russian conflict. The newspaper believes that the conflict of interests in Manchuria is another proof of the disintegration of the world. The newspaper further stated that the current situation in Britain, Germany, and Austria, and the events that have occurred in Manchuria, have a common driving force, namely economic oppression and political tension. Russia should observe and wait for the opportunity. (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Diplomatic Policy Toward Japan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting reported on the weekly memorial service at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 21st: (1) Regarding the Japanese army's violent occupation of Shenyang and other places, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged an urgent and serious protest with the Japanese ambassador as soon as it received the official telegram on the 19th, demanding that the Japanese army immediately withdraw and restore the situation to its original state, and urgently telegraphed our embassy in Tokyo to make the same protest. Yesterday, we lodged another protest, reserving the right to make all appropriate demands in this matter. We firmly believe that the League of Nations is an organization that advocates international justice and maintains world peace, so we have telegraphed the details to our national representative in Geneva, thinking that the League of Nations will be able to handle this matter. In recent years, the League of Nations has tried to deal with disputes between the two countries, such as Paraguay and Bolivia, Poland and Lithuania, and Greece and Bulgaria, all of which have been handled appropriately. If international right and wrong have not been obliterated, the world will be able to give a more appropriate judgment to this Japanese military invasion and our large-scale attack without resistance. We also firmly believe that the Kellogg-Briand Pact signed the year before last can indeed guarantee peace and eliminate force, so we have also informed the signatory countries of the pact of this matter. If this pact is indeed supported by the signatory countries, they should know that the situation currently created by the Japanese army in the Eastern Provinces is completely contrary to the provisions of the Non-War Pact, and they will be able to immediately order it to restore the original state based on this pact. (2) The actions of the Japanese this time seem to be quite in line with the policy of Japanese soldiers toward China throughout history. Recalling that in the fourth year of the Republic of China, Japan relied on force to force us to recognize the Twenty-One Demands, and in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, it used force to create the Jinan Massacre. Recently, there have been the Wan Incident and the Korean Incident. Last month, the Japanese army openly crossed the border and built a bridge in the Tumen River to conduct military exercises, ignoring our protests. It is clear that Japanese soldiers have exposed their force from time to time, and their intention to undermine peace is obvious. In the past few days, there were rumors that the Japanese army was preparing to move, but the chargé d'affaires in China still had a statement that this rumor was completely unfounded, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo also officially stated that no accidents would occur. However, in less than two days, this unprecedented violent act occurred. Our government and people are deeply saddened by this act, and we are also very sorry that the Japanese people are bearing the name of being subjected to military oppression. (3) At this critical moment of life and death, the whole country, both above and below, should quickly unite to respond to this serious situation. Our home can be broken, people can die, but the national sovereignty and land given to us by our ancestors must not be lost. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will be able to quickly rise up and not let down their ancestors. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

Its neighbors should, on humanitarian grounds, extend the meaning of relief, but Japan has actually used force against China, which can be done at any time. It is necessary to take advantage of China's crisis to carry out its means of looting a burning house. Its stupidity is ridiculous, and its heart is too cruel. Moreover, 80% of the economic rights in South Manchuria are in the hands of Japan. Why bother making a fuss and putting itself in injustice? China maintains two million regular troops, which consume up to 90% of its annual military expenditure of more than 400 million yuan. But there is no military preparedness internationally. I wonder what the people involved in this incident feel. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

It requested them to awaken immediately, restore unity, and jointly save the country. It also telegraphed the entire nation, stating that on the 19th, the Japanese army used force to occupy Shenyang, Yingkou, Changchun, Liaoyang, and seized military and police equipment from various government offices, replacing them with the Japanese flag. The Japanese armies in Tianjin, Korea, Lushun, Tieling, and Haicheng have all been mobilized, and the Japanese navy has moved to Niuzhuang, heading towards Tianjin.

The entire venue was silent, extremely tragic and sorrowful. Li Shizeng gave a speech, saying that the Shenyang Incident proves that we Chinese people must strive for peace and not be emotionally impulsive. We must unite internally and resist Japan together, and we can succeed.

Under the guidance of the government, we must fight and not just engage in exaggerated propaganda. Wu Tiecheng gave a speech that was most tragic and impassioned, with tears streaming down his face. The atmosphere in the entire venue was tense. Wu said that this unfortunate incident occurred while our party was in power, and our party should take responsibility and blame itself. He solemnly announced to the public on behalf of all party members that all comrades of our party are willing to take full responsibility, go through fire and water, and are willing to sacrifice all lives, and we cannot allow an inch of land under the rule of our party to be lost.

<p>Financial Turmoil</p>
<p>Government Temporarily Responds to Emergency</p>
<p>Announces Suspension of Gold Standard</p>
<p>To Prevent Continued Outflow of Cash</p>
<p>To Prevent Continued Outflow of Cash</p>
<p>World Stock Exchanges Suspend Trading</p>
<p>Japan Particularly Panicked</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – Britain has now suspended the gold standard. Last night, the government issued a statement saying that after consultation with the Bank of England, it has been decided that the clause in the 1925 Gold Standard Act that allows the Bank of England to sell cash at a fixed price must be suspended. This bill has now been submitted to the Lower House, with the aim of passing it through both houses today. Although the bill has not yet passed, the Bank of England has been ordered to begin implementation, which it has been doing since midnight. At the same time, the Bank of England announced that the discount rate would be increased from 4.5% to 6% from this morning. In recent months, cash has been flowing out of the London market continuously, and the government has been forced to take this measure. Yesterday's sharp drop in the price of British gold in New York caused Prime Minister MacDonald to rush back to London from his country villa to consult with Bank of England officials and convene a special cabinet meeting. After the meeting, this statement was issued. The UK resumed the gold standard in April 1925, and overseas autonomous states soon followed suit. By the end of the following year, countries using gold as currency accounted for 60% of the world's population. The so-called gold standard, briefly speaking, means that currency can be legally exchanged for a fixed amount of cash. All currency obligations must be met with cash at a fixed rate. Therefore, in countries that implement the gold standard, the exchange rate of their currency with foreign countries is linked to the price of gold, and their exchange rate with other gold standard countries varies depending on whether it is more profitable to import or export cash. The British government's move can slightly eliminate the reasons for manipulating the British currency. From now on, the price of the British currency will not be linked to gold, but to international debt. In other words, it depends on whether foreign creditor countries can or are willing to maintain the stability of the British currency. Paris has expressed that the French Ministry of Finance is eager to provide the necessary funds to protect the British currency from fluctuations. Since mid-July, the cash, foreign currency, and debt withdrawn from the London market have totaled £200 million. In recent days, the Netherlands and other countries have withdrawn a significant amount of foreign currency from the UK, so the British government has a real need to protect the Bank of England's gold reserves. This decision does not affect the British government's and the Bank of England's obligation to pay debts in foreign currency. The Bank of England's gold reserves currently total £130 million, which is sufficient to meet various emergency needs, but it is felt that at the current time, it is not appropriate to further reduce gold reserves by allowing European countries to withdraw them. European withdrawals are based on psychological factors, namely a sudden lack of confidence in the UK's financial capabilities. The London Stock Exchange is closed today, but the settlement of transactions is still ongoing. Ordinary banking business will not be suspended and will remain open as usual. There is no reason for British currency transactions to be affected, but banks have agreed to cooperate and restrict Britons from buying foreign currency. However, those needed for commercial purposes or to fulfill existing contracts are not subject to these restrictions. The government has also issued a warning, saying that while it does not believe that the current difficulties are entirely due to the outflow of funds by Britons, most of the withdrawals are due to foreigners. However, the government is willing to reiterate the warning issued by the Financial Secretary in the Lower House: any Briton who buys foreign currency himself or helps others to do so, thereby increasing the tension in the foreign exchange market, is deliberately aggravating the country's difficulties. It is also said that the country's wealth is great, and the government is confident that the current exchange difficulties are only temporary. The decision to suspend the gold standard was made by the entire cabinet. The Bank of England had hoped to avoid this move, but the large-scale withdrawals on Friday and Saturday prompted an urgent plan to be implemented immediately. It is generally speculated that the suspension of the gold standard will last for seven months. British newspapers all welcomed this move, and even the opposition Labour Party's newspaper called it appropriate.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – This afternoon, the Prime Minister formally submitted the 1931 Gold Standard Act to the Lower House. Financial Secretary Snowden will issue a statement to explain the bill and will second it. It is expected that there will be no opposition in the Lower House. After the Lower House passes it, it will be submitted to the specially convened Upper House, and then, with the approval of the King, it will take effect tonight. It is reported that the bill contains three main clauses: (1) Suspending part of the 1925 Gold Standard Act; (2) Compensating the Bank of England for the losses caused by the cabinet's orders; (3) Stipulating regulations (if necessary, by order of the Treasury) to deal with any situation that has occurred or may occur. The last clause is expected to be aimed at any amount of British capital flowing abroad. If grain prices soar, the government will immediately stop it. The bill is valid for six months, but it can be extended through ordinary parliamentary procedures. The election issue has been put aside because of yesterday's government decision. Reuters, London, 21st – This morning, people rubbed their eyes and were stunned when they read the newspaper reports about the government's measures yesterday. It was unexpected and they did not understand its meaning. Most people do not understand the complicated issues of the gold standard, so they questioned each other. On the trains to the city, there was also a lot of talk about this matter. All kinds of workers seemed deeply concerned and eager to know how the government's decision would affect them. Merchants and securities brokers were also shocked after reading the newspapers. The streets leading to the stock exchange, which are usually very lively around 10 o'clock, were almost deserted today because the government ordered the market to be closed. It is generally believed that the reason for the suspension is to prevent foreign countries from selling British securities on a large scale. On Saturday and Sunday, the stock exchange was open all day, and foreigners who held British securities sold them off, causing prices to fall.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 21st – Newspapers of all parties praised the courage of the British people in dealing with the financial crisis. Le Matin reported that the French government is now quickly considering the plans to be taken. Minister of Finance Flandin convened a meeting of experts this morning to receive the best advice on the issue. Several experts have rushed back from Geneva. The Banque de France currently has 12,500,000,000 francs in London.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 21st – After consulting with Minister of Finance Flandin, French Prime Minister Laval declared that the French government is closely monitoring the situation in the UK and is willing to assist the British government.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – Today, large silver bars soared. The near-term rose nearly two pence, from 12 pence and 15/16ths the day before to 14 pence and 3/8ths today. The forward rose one and a half pence, from 13 pence the day before to 14 and a half pence today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – European stock exchanges are almost all closed today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 21st – The stock exchanges here and in Bombay were not open today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Copenhagen, 21st – Due to the UK's suspension of part of the gold standard, the Copenhagen Stock Exchange decided to suspend trading today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 21st – The board of directors of the Berlin Stock Exchange met this morning to discuss the measures to be taken after the UK suspended part of the gold standard. A director told a Reuters reporter that the Berlin Stock Exchange must be temporarily closed. It is rumored that the German government will adopt more stringent plans to restrict foreign exchange transactions. It is heard that the national bank will raise the discount rate.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 21st – New York banking circles said that the British government's suspension of the gold standard is a constructive measure prompted by a temporary emergency. The loans recently borrowed by the US Federal Reserve Bank and Morgan Company to the UK are stipulated to be repaid in US dollars, so they are not affected. There is also no relationship with the US dollar debt issued by the UK in the US. It is expected that British banking officials will follow the German method of managing foreign exchange. When the news of the British government's decision reached here, securities brokers were quite shaken, but important bankers said that this matter has very little impact on the US because the US has far fewer short-term funds deposited in London than in Berlin, estimated at no more than $50 million.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st – The Tokyo Stock Exchange panicked upon hearing the news of the UK's suspension of the gold standard and immediately suspended trading. Although the Osaka Stock Exchange did not suspend trading immediately, prices fell sharply and it also suspended trading soon after. The Minister of Finance claimed that Japan and other countries may be indirectly affected, but Japan does not need to restore the gold embargo. After the war, Japan's gold accounts have been transferred from London to the United States, so he expects that Japanese finances can avoid direct impact.</p>

<p>Memorial Service for Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian Speaks on Japan's Disregard for Justice and Exploitation of Danger</p>
<p>Those Who Are Disloyal, Unfilial, Unbenevolent, and Unrighteous Have No Reason to Exist</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 21st, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service for the 11th anniversary of Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom and the 130th memorial week. Central Committee members Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Daofan, Shao Lizi, Fang Juehui, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Renjie, Chen Lifu, and Shao Yuanchong, as well as staff and guests, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting. After paying respects, Dai made the following report: "Comrades, today is the 11th anniversary of Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom. This year, as we commemorate Mr. Zhu, our country is suffering from severe natural and man-made disasters, and has also been subjected to major foreign trampling. We should make a unanimous and painful determination to learn from Mr. Zhu's character and from the Prime Minister's character. All party comrades and all the people of the country should take Mr. Zhu's ambition as their own and the Prime Minister's heart as their own, abandon all personal opinions, emotions, and interests, and unite sincerely to save the country from danger. This time, Japan suddenly sent troops to the three northeastern provinces, occupying Changchun in the north, Yingkou in the west, and Andong in the south in one day and night. At the same time, it increased its troops in Qingdao and took action towards Jinzhou. All the places in the east, west, south, and north of Liaoning Province were occupied by the Japanese army. Hebei and Shandong were also under threat at the same time. All the arsenals, important administrative organs, industrial organs, cultural organs, and financial organs in Liaoning were occupied. There is no precedent for such a barbaric and tyrannical country in the world. There is no precedent for such a barbaric and tyrannical act in the world. Human civilization exists for the survival and happiness of mankind, so civilization is justice, and justice is civilization. China has thousands of years of civilization and thousands of years of education. No matter how deep the personal grudges are between individuals, if others are in great danger, they must not be treated cruelly and violently. The same is true for countries. Therefore, since ancient times, China's national morality has advocated continuing what has been cut off, raising what has been abolished, governing chaos and maintaining danger, rescuing disasters and comforting difficulties, and being generous in giving and frugal in taking. China has been the largest country in Asia for thousands of years, and has never destroyed other countries or invaded their lands. Moreover, it has only helped neighboring countries in times of disaster and danger, and has never taken the opportunity to plunder. This time, China's flood is an unprecedented disaster since the ancient floods. The disaster area covers sixteen provinces, and the number of victims is close to 100 million. The three rivers and two rivers are full of collapsed cities and destroyed ponds, and there are corpses everywhere. There are displaced people everywhere. In this situation, Japan, a neighboring country of the same race and culture that has been influenced by Chinese culture for thousands of years, does not provide relief, but instead takes the opportunity to plunder, sending troops to occupy our territory, destroy our treasuries, and kill our people. Such a cruel and inhuman country is not as good as a poisonous cannibalistic race. It can be said that it is a disgrace to mankind and a humiliation to civilization. Recalling nine years ago, Japan also suffered a strange disaster of a major earthquake. At that time, how did the countries of the world express their sympathy and provide all kinds of assistance? All of Japan's requests were unconditionally granted by all countries, and the voluntary requests for relief were too numerous to remember. Therefore, it has today's revival. Looking only at Germany, after the European war, it suffered a major blow and its economy was extremely difficult. Its relief to Japan was also all-encompassing and sincere. Valuable books in the library, as long as there were two copies, were willing to give one to him. Therefore, the world treats him like that for his cultural recovery today. He treats his neighboring countries like this. Moreover, China is of the same race and is the motherland of his civilization. Everything he eats, wears, lives, travels, writes, speaks, and has cultural relics and institutions, which one is not a grace from China? Such ingratitude and opportunistic robbery is truly heartbreaking. We are convinced that such a disloyal, unfilial, unbenevolent, and unrighteous thing has no reason to exist if the world's justice is not destroyed. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Zhu, we hope that all party comrades and all the people of the country will be thoroughly awakened, regardless of north, south, east, or west, old or young, male or female, to be sincere and sincere, abandon all disputes of emotion and disputes of interest, and unite to learn from the Prime Minister and Mr. Zhu's love for the country, love for the people, love for comrades, and love for justice, and fight to the end with the determination to die."</p>

<p>Executive Committee Meeting of the Education Circles' National Salvation Federation</p>
<p>The first executive committee meeting of the Shanghai Education Circles' National Salvation Federation began at 6:30 p.m. on the 21st. A telegram was drafted and passed at the second meeting at 4:00 p.m. the next day (the 22nd) to be sent out.

<p>Students of the East Asian Tongwen Academy Boycott Classes</p>
<p>The East Asian Tongwen Academy in Xujiahui, this municipality, is an aggressive machine established by Japanese imperialism under the guise of scholarship. It has been in operation for 31 years. The school sends more than 100 students from this country every year. After graduating in four years, they are introduced by the school authorities to serve in Japanese agencies in Northeast China, acting as pioneers for Japanese imperialism's aggression against our country. There are almost no aggressive machines established by Japanese imperialism in our country that do not have graduates of this school among them. In 1920, the school also established a Chinese student department, specializing in recruiting students from our country. However, Japanese imperialism has never shed its ferocious face towards our country. Therefore, the students of the Chinese department of the school have always been in a state of disagreement with the school authorities. Recently, after the students of the Chinese department of the school received news of the Japanese imperialists' atrocities in the Northeast, they were extremely sad and angry. They convened an emergency meeting of all members at 9 a.m. yesterday and decided to boycott classes. They also organized an emergency committee to actively engage in anti-Japanese work. The telegram issued by the student union yesterday is listed below for the reference of all newspapers and compatriots across the country. Japanese imperialism, based on its ambition to invade our country, has repeatedly deliberately provoked incidents. The bloodstains of the massacred overseas Chinese in Korea have not yet dried, and now it has gone a step further, using the so-called Nakamura incident as an excuse to send troops to occupy our territory and slaughter our soldiers and civilians, not hesitating to risk the great disapproval of the world to achieve its ambition to annex Manchuria and Mongolia. The students of this association, because they are in the East Asian Tongwen Academy, an aggressive machine, are close to the eyes and ears, so their hatred is also the deepest. They clearly see that their usual intentions are all to place our country under their knife, and now they have done this atrocity. The students of this association are filled with sadness and anger, and their eyes are tearing with blood. They have now unanimously boycotted classes and are actively engaged in anti-Japanese work. We hope that all compatriots across the country will be of one heart and one mind to resist the violence and urge the government to immediately send troops to declare war on Japan. The members of this association vow to be pioneers and dare to wait for orders. Shanghai East Asian Tongwen Academy Chinese Department Student Union, September 21st</p>
<p>Solemn and Inspiring Fudan Memorial Week</p>
<p>Fudan University, the deans and secretaries of each college, as well as teachers and staff, held a discussion on the anti-Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces in the school's conference hall the day before yesterday. Five resolutions were made: (1) Fudan teachers and students will permanently boycott Japanese goods; (2) Each department will elect two representatives to organize the Fudan Aspiration Association; (3) Fudan teachers and students will be militarized; (4) Four telegrams will be sent, (A) to Chairman Chiang and members of the National Government in Nanjing, (B) to Deputy Commander Zhang in Peiping, (C) to Mr. Tang Shaochuan and others in Guangzhou, (D) to UN Representative Shi Zhaoji; (5) Report on the memorial week, the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast. The school held a memorial week at 10 a.m. yesterday. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn. The main points are recorded below.</p>
<p>The school's president Li Denghui, Secretary-General Jin Tongyin, the deans and department heads of each college, the teachers of the practical middle school, and hundreds of male and female students and school workers sat cross-legged on the grass, with extremely solemn attitudes. President Li Denghui briefly said that the teachers and students of this school are paying close attention to the violent Japanese occupation of our three northeastern provinces, which is very commendable. However, the problem with our Chinese people is that they are perfunctory and cannot persevere to the end. For example, the previous Wan case and the Korean case were very lively during the summer vacation, but they have now disappeared. Therefore, this violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast will not be resolved in one day, one month, or one year. Our Chinese people should not just send telegrams and issue declarations, but should seek a fundamental solution. That is, the Japanese Empire has its current status in the world because it has been preparing for fifty years. The total number of Japanese people is only 60 million, while the Chinese people number 400 million, but their economy, financial strength, and political status are not as good as Japan's. This is because the Chinese people cannot cooperate, are a sheet of loose sand, and tend to be perfunctory in everything they do. Therefore, to save China's crisis, the people and the government must unite and work hard to resist foreign aggression. Decisions made, Fudan teachers and students will be militarized, vowing not to buy Japanese goods, raising arms to take an oath. All teachers and students stood up and raised their arms to take an oath. The oath is as follows: "I, in view of the daily urgency of the country's troubles, vow to dedicate myself to the country from now on, and strive throughout my life to restore the glory of the nation and resist foreign aggression. If I do not keep this promise, may I be abandoned by the Chinese people." Slogans were shouted: (1) Support the Three People's Principles, (2) Implement the Prime Minister's Testament, (3) Down with Japanese Imperialism, (4) Strictly implement revolutionary diplomacy, (5) Restore the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, (6) The heart of the Chinese people will never die. The telegrams sent by the school, in addition to the one to UN Representative Shi Zhaoji, included the third telegram to Chairman Chiang, with the following text: (1) To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing and members of the National Government, the shame of Jinan has not been avenged, and the disaster of Shenyang has arrived again. Those who have blood and energy cannot but be indignant. Since things have come to this, the only thing to do is to abandon suspicions, unite internally, and go to the national crisis together. We should also pay attention to both diplomacy and military affairs and actively proceed. Rather than surviving by obeying Japan, we should die by resisting Japan. The will of the people is here, please observe carefully. (2) To Deputy Commander Zhang in Peiping, the Japanese army has occupied Shenyang and is eyeing Peiping and Tianjin. You have a responsibility to defend the territory. The feud of your father has not been avenged. At this time of great disaster, you should personally lead your soldiers to do your best to resist the enemy, and do not be greedy for ease and comfort and become a sinner for all ages. (3) To Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Wang Jingwei, Gu Yingfen, Sun Ke, Deng Zeru, and other gentlemen in Guangzhou, the Japanese army has occupied the Northeast, and the destruction of the country is imminent. As fellow citizens, how can you not be aware of this and stop fighting to resist foreign aggression? Now is the time to rise up together and go to the national crisis together to save the precarious situation.</p>

Slogans were posted everywhere in the school to arouse the attention of the students.

<p>Gu's Private Primary School on Zhongzhou Road falsely claimed to be registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. This was recently heard by the Municipal Education Bureau, which sent staff to investigate and found it to be true. The procedures were also mostly non-compliant. It has already sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to close the school to avoid harming children. The school's request to hold a ping-pong championship has also been rejected.</p>

<p>Zhuang Mingzhen Breaks National Women's Long Jump Record | 4.55 Meters</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondent reports that the Jiangsu Provincial Preliminary Rounds for the National Games are aimed at training athletes.</p>
<p>The first day dawned with clear skies and bright autumn sunshine. The reporter arrived at the venue at 8 AM and found athletes gathering on the field, practicing freely. The rostrum was quiet as the meeting time had not yet arrived. After some time, guests and organizers arrived one after another. The meeting began at 9 AM. All athletes marched around the field, flags flying, showing great vitality. After the music played, formalities were observed.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Hexian said in his speech that today's Jiangsu preliminary round is taking place while the country is suffering from widespread floods. The central government has decided to temporarily suspend all activities, except for the National Games, which will proceed as planned. We must understand that sports are related to the survival of the nation and the people, which is different from ordinary matters. The purpose of our participation in sports is not only to break records and win championships, but also to emphasize the importance of a healthy body and a healthy mind for any endeavor. The work of struggle cannot be achieved merely by propaganda or issuing a declaration or writing an article. For example, today we all know that the Japanese have unjustifiably occupied Shenyang in our Northeast, massacring our people. Our people have only retreated, unprepared. The people's cultivation is also unsound. It is a shame to be insulted by neighboring countries in this way. If we want to fight the enemy at this time, we must rely on the people having a healthy physique to win. Today, everyone is participating in the preliminary round under such painful circumstances, and we must have a deep understanding of this point. Finished. Next,</p>
<p>Yu Qingtang reported the number of counties and people participating in the sports meet. There were 18 counties, 254 male participants, and 76 female participants. There were 19 school units and 18 public units. In addition to track and field events, there were 1 male volleyball team, 1 male football team, 8 male basketball teams, and 9 male tennis teams. In addition to track and field events, there were 3 female volleyball teams, 2 female basketball teams, and 1 female tennis team. In addition, there was also a heartfelt expression of grief over the Japanese occupation of Shenyang in the three northeastern provinces. The representative of the Provincial Party Department, Lan Weibin, gave a training speech, stating that Japan has no way out for its surplus population each year. Going south, the South Seas Islands have been almost completely developed by various countries. Going north, it is ice and snow, which cannot be used. Only our country has a pleasant climate and fertile land, which is enough to fulfill its continental dream, not hesitating to defy the world. We did not start a war without reason. You are all young people with blood. If you don’t have a healthy physique, how can you take on the important responsibilities in the future? Your attendance at this meeting is not for personal face, not for a school’s honor, but for the survival of the country. (1) Track and Field Competition</p>

<p>Many of my peers have become officials, and some are even high-ranking officials. Some of them are doing quite well, while others are somewhat muddled on major issues but clear on minor ones. I wrote a poem to advise them to be mindful of Dong Hu's resurrection. But there are so many officials in the world, and the muddled ones are not limited to my friends. Now I am willing to offer this poem to friends to all officials in the world. Let’s all work hard!</p>
<p>"Do not be a muddled official…</p>
<p>Ten thousand people in sorrow, one person in joy.</p>
<p>Dong Hu has a pen harder than iron,</p>
<p>Writing only right and wrong, never turning."</p>

<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Treasures on the Beach: There are several beaches along the coast of England where one can find a large number of gemstones. Although not rare treasures, agates and topaz are not ordinary items either. Yet they are often found on the beach, allowing people to gain without labor. Recently, the Bishop of Plymouth dedicated a set of altar lamps to St. Andrews Church, inlaid with forty-eight beautiful topaz stones. It is said that all of them were picked up from the beach by a female parishioner. She initially only picked up forty stones and gave them to the lamp maker, asking if they could be used. The lamp maker first drew a pattern, but found that the forty stones were not enough to distribute and that eight more were needed. The female parishioner, hearing this, hurried back to the beach and searched for a week, finally fulfilling her wish.</p>
<p>Scarlet amber can often be found on the beaches along the east coast of England. It is said to have washed up all the way from the Baltic Sea. Near the mouths of several large rivers in Scotland, many pearl divers collect pearls from shells. They obtain a lot, and the pearls are large and beautiful, welcomed by women, thus gaining great profit.</p>
<h3 id="e70">What I Saw on Wusong Road, Hongkou, on the Morning of September 19, 1931 <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Mingxin</p>
<p>Recently, Sino-Japanese negotiations have become increasingly tense. Japanese soldiers are openly advocating for a military solution, showing their disregard for China and international justice. Although our country has been pursuing a policy of peace and making concessions, the Japanese have been unrelenting in their demands. The voice of preparation for war is becoming increasingly urgent. Those with insight have long expected that there would be no good outcome. Now, they blatantly disregard public opinion and violently occupied the provincial capital of Liaoning on the evening of the 18th at 10:30 PM. They are further expanding their ambitions and have begun shelling our national army in various places along the South Manchurian Railway. It is clear that this was organized and prepared in advance. The cause of the conflict and how our authorities are responding will not be discussed here. What follows is a description of the actions of the Japanese on Wusong Road on the 19th. I wonder what our compatriots will think after reading this.</p>
<p>Japanese telegraph propaganda is known for its speed. As the conflict broke out, most Chinese people were still dreaming, but the Japanese Daily News on Wusong Road posted a war report next to its gate at 5 AM and issued special editions. By 11 AM, there were seven telegrams posted. The large-character headline read "Major Sino-Japanese Military Conflict." At 10:30 PM on the 18th, the attack on Beida Camp began (the residence of the Northeast Army, magnificently built on a national scale, capable of accommodating 200,000 people). By 1:30 AM on the 19th, it was completely occupied. At 3 AM, the commercial district was cleared, and at 6:30 AM, the city of Liaoning was completely occupied. All Chinese military police were disarmed, and so on. At the same time, major Japanese stores on Wusong Road distributed the same war reports and posted them outside their doors. Being in the middle of it felt like being on a battlefield. Chinese people who saw it were indignant, while the Japanese showed smiles and were arrogant. The tension in everyone's hearts was high, and there was a possibility of conflict at any time. However, once one crossed Wusong Road to Great Horse Road and Fuzhou Road, the scene was bustling and peaceful, as usual. This shows the numbness of the Chinese people. Unable to calm down after returning home, I especially record this to inform my compatriots, hoping they will wake up quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e71">A Day at Ye Garden <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Hua</p>
<p>Since the opening of Ye Garden in Jiangwan, I have long wanted to visit, but I have been unable to do so due to busy schedules. The 19th was the first day of the charity performance for flood relief in various provinces held in the garden, so I made time to visit. Upon arrival, the scene was bustling and prosperous, crowded with tourists, all enthusiastic men and women, which is admirable. It was the most grand occasion ever seen on Jiangwan Road. The following is a brief description of the highlights of the event.</p>
<p>Because I was new to Ye Garden, I was unfamiliar with the paths. Fortunately, upon entering, Boy Scouts distributed maps, allowing me to explore everything. The garden is full of layered hills and greenery, a unique paradise. The best views are Fuhu Ridge, Qianlong Pool, Purple Bamboo Forest, Little Tiantai, Willow Waves Listening to Orioles, and Odd Peaks Inserting Clouds. Other places such as Little Luofu, Glazed Pavilion, Qingtang Bridge, and Lakeside Pavilion are also fascinating, as if one were in a fairyland.</p>
<p>This time, because a 49-foot-high Temple of Heaven was built in the garden, the 63rd generation Zhang Tianshi from Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi was specially invited to chase and sacrifice the souls of the disaster victims. Most tourists wanted to catch a glimpse of Tianshi's true face, and his appeal can be described as great. The Temple of Heaven was made of bamboo and wood and surrounded by yellow cloth, towering above the clouds. Eight trigram flags were hung above, fluttering in the air. In the evening, the electric lights were all lit up, as bright as day. The perimeter of the garden was hung with lanterns of various colors, adding to the splendor. There were countless entertainment programs. As far as I know, the Yongyi Film Company's entire cast performed the drama "Disaster Tragedy." The plot was sad and moving. The performances of Li Changjian and the two ladies Li Li and Wang Guiqiu were particularly tearful and energetic. At that time, a gentleman in the audience threw silver coins onto the stage five times, making a clanging sound. So one person responded to a hundred calls and took out money one after another. Then, the person in charge and a tourist served as witnesses and put the money into the donation box. From this, we can know the depth of the drama's appeal. After the performance, the manager of the company, Zhao Yongni, performed head-hitting iron, which was thrilling and breathtaking.</p>
<p>Guan Shengyuan specially sold noodles and dim sum in the garden. According to what Xi Guansheng told me, some of the proceeds will be used to help with disaster relief. I also met Qian Huafo, one of the initiators of the event, who has been abandoning painting and arranging the venue for days. According to him, the event will last for a total of five days, with entertainment programs changing every day. Fireworks and river lanterns will be lit in the evening. (Move and reward for disaster relief)</p>
<h3 id="e72">A Discussion of the Lives of Gandhi and Tagore <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Mr. Jingwan convened a "Lunch Talk." Those attending were prominent, although not necessarily the elite of the nation, but they came from all directions, which was also rare. Among them were Ms. Hu Lanqi, who had recently returned to China with Madam Sun; Ms. Lu Jingqing, who had returned from Japan; Ms. Tao Xuan, a female member of the Legislative Yuan who came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday; and Mr. Zhou Shoujuan and Mr. Huang Jiping, both reporters from Shenbao. I had returned from Tibet and India a month ago. Jingwan asked Ms. Hu to talk about Madam Sun's life, and instructed me to talk about the lives of Gandhi and Tagore. After the talks, Mr. Zhou was ordered to take notes to fill the "Free Talk" column. This is not writing a formal essay, but merely providing some conversation material.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The Chinese people have seen many photos of Mr. Gandhi, with his skinny frame, bare body, bald head, and bare feet. His "thinness" surpasses that of Mr. Shoujuan; there is no comparison. From his photos with his skinny frame, bare body, bald head, and bare feet, one can imagine his life.</p>
<p>Mr. Gandhi was originally the son of a wealthy family, but now he has no property or home. His wife and children follow him, constantly moving, never settling down, to engage in national revolution and the transformation of the country and society. His clothing is all spun and woven by himself, and little sewing is involved. In the summer, he only wears a cloth around his lower body. In the cold, he puts on a shawl over his upper body. Wherever he goes, he carries a spinning wheel with him. Indians who come to see him all wear "Gandhi cloth," and no one wears a Western suit or foreign clothes. Even Westerners who come to see him do the same. His diet is simple and light, mainly consisting of goat's milk and vegetables. He absolutely forbids killing animals and eating meat.</p>
<p>He usually gets up at four in the morning. His bedding is a wooden bed and a straw mat, or he sleeps directly on the ground. After washing and bathing, he holds a morning meeting with his disciples, reciting poems, singing songs, and engaging in silent prayer. During the day, in addition to working and meeting guests, he often spins yarn, reads books, and writes articles. He takes walks outside the village around six in the morning and evening. He remains silent one day each week, not uttering a sound, to rest. If there is something to say, he communicates with writing or gestures. This day is called "Silence Day." However, work such as spinning yarn, reading books, writing articles, and clearing correspondence continues as usual. In short, Mr. Gandhi's life can be summarized as "austere." Mr. Gandhi was born in 1869 and is sixty-two years old this year.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Mr. Tagore is known to the world as a poet and philosopher. But Mr. Tagore is not only a poet and philosopher, but also a musician and painter. In other words, he is a complete artistic poet and philosopher. And Mr. Tagore's life is also an artistic poetic and philosophical life. Mr. Tagore's family is even more noble than that of Mr. Gandhi. His grandfather and father were both saints of India. Mr. Tagore has further advanced and glorified their legacy. Mr. Tagore's old home is in Calcutta, but he often resides in his newly built private property at Santiniketan International University. The architecture is beautiful, exquisite, and also very grand, shaped like coral. I once wrote four lines of poetry to praise it:</p>
<p>"A coral-shaped building,</p>
<p>This is the poet's home.</p>
<p>I hope the poet sings,</p>
<p>And chants more about slums."</p>
<p>Mr. Tagore's clothing and food are also very frugal. Although he does not spin and weave himself like Gandhi, all his clothes are Indian products. He regards Western suits and foreign clothes as shameful. His food mainly consists of milk, sweets, and vegetables, but he does not abstain from meat. He gets up early at four in the morning to pray for world peace and happiness. He takes outdoor walks before sunrise, three seasons a year (Indian weather is divided into three seasons), regardless of the heat or cold. During the day, in addition to reading books and writing poems, he often writes articles and paints. His hand never stops writing or painting. He even places books beside him during meals. In the evening, he summons male and female students to sing the poems and songs he has composed. The sound overflows, filling the ears. When he completes a new article, he immediately gives a lecture, his voice clear and loud like a bell. He usually receives guests after four in the afternoon. In spring and winter, famous people from Europe and America come from thousands of miles away to catch a glimpse of Mr. Tagore's demeanor, in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Mr. Tagore was born in 1861 and is exactly seventy years old this year. In summary, Mr. Tagore's life can be described as "happy."</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Having briefly discussed the lives of Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Tagore, I would like to add one more word. We are born into this Saha world, and we should wish that everyone's life is like Tagore's, but for our own temporary life, we should learn from Gandhi.</p>

<h3 id="e73">A Husband's Wife (20) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's heart was pounding, his breathing was unusually heavy, much more so than usual. The teacup in his hand was trembling. Besides Madam Li, he saw nothing in front of him, like being slightly drunk from overindulging in alcohol, in a daze. He didn't understand what was happening. He was even more confused, wondering if he was a married man, and if she was a married woman. Was this situation reasonable? He only felt that her beauty, her tenderness, her pity, her temperament, and her will all suited him. Her not rejecting his attentiveness was a precious thing. He felt that only she was his confidante, and decided to treat her as an ideal lover or wife.</p>
<p>"Have you found out about the matter I entrusted to you?" Madam Li spoke first, after a long silence between the two.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry, I haven't inquired about it yet. But I think it's best for you not to know about this matter. Knowing it will only cause you more trouble. Haven't I advised you repeatedly?" Mr. Chen sat beside her. She turned to the side, making room for him to sit down. Their bodies were now very close.</p>
<p>"I consider myself a woman, and my capacity is not as great as you men. I don't believe that there is any woman in the world who would not inquire about her husband's love history with other women. The woman in the car the other day must have been his lover, without a doubt."</p>
<p>"My wife has been going out with him often these days, maybe she can find out something."</p>
<p>"If you don't want to help me, that's fine; why do you always say this to me? To be honest, I don't really approve of your wife going to the movies and dance halls with my husband."</p>
<p>"Do you suspect that there is something ambiguous between them as well?"</p>
<p>"If you were a woman, and your husband and his friend's wife were so close, would you not be suspicious?"</p>
<p>"Then, starting tomorrow, I will forbid her from associating with Mr. Li again. Would that satisfy you?"</p>
<p>"That's not what I'm aiming for. I've heard people say that one's own writing is the best, and someone else's wife is the best. This can represent the psychology of most men. Do you agree?"</p>
<p>"It's difficult for me to answer this question immediately. I only feel that the union of husband and wife involves more emotion in the beginning. After the initial period, both parties bear a kind of obligation, and the emotion decreases. This is also a very common fact. Because the exchange of emotion is a kind of sacrifice, while obligation is a business matter, with some bargaining and weighing. If there is a slight difference in quality, disputes or resentment will arise. Before I got married, I only imagined that the life of a couple living together would be completely sweet and cooperative. After getting married, I realized that the relationship between husband and wife is such a troublesome thing. So, I think that if men and women have feelings and fall in love, they don't need to get married. It's better to maintain a friendship forever, so that there are no obligations. Without obligations, there will be less trouble, and both will be free."</p>

<h3 id="e74">Gold Price Plummets <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>A Drastic Drop of Sixty Taels and Six Mace</p>
<p>Rumor of British Ban on Cash Exports: Yesterday, the 21st, the plunge in gold prices was unprecedented, with fluctuations of ten taels in an instant. Each transaction saw swings of at least five mace to one tael. The violent waves were ultimately uncontrollable. From morning to night, there was a difference of about fifty taels. The final disastrous fall of sixty taels was an unexpected and sudden change. This was due to Japan's aggressive actions in the Eastern Provinces, making the situation even more urgent, like a bolt from the blue. Dealers engaged in mass selling, trying to dispose of their holdings, which was severely impacted, creating great fear. The market opened with a sharp drop, and because the silver market rose, sellers did not stop. Short sellers aggressively added to their positions, causing the foreign exchange to weaken. As a result, the gold price broke through 730 taels. The market remained weak, sellers were bold, and exchange rates hardened. British gold at 1425 was difficult to sell, and rumors spread that Britain had banned the export of cash, making people even more fearful. There was a sudden sense of collapse, breaking through the 700 tael mark. Afterwards, buyers appeared, and the market eased, rising by more than ten taels. Later, it fluctuated around 705-6 taels, but the situation was extremely chaotic. Clearing houses were especially chaotic, making it difficult to gather information.</p>
<p>The market opened with a direct plunge. The November opening fell sharply by 24 taels and 6 mace, to 742 taels (although there were fluctuations of over 20 taels within the first ten minutes or so, from 50 taels to within 30 taels). Then, the Dalian group tried to cover their short positions, briefly reaching 47 taels and a half. However, sellers continued to emerge, causing a sharp drop of 16-17 taels, reaching only 31 taels. British gold also eased, with banks trading at 13 and a half. Soon after, November contracts settled at 6875. Before long, it rose by 6 jiao, reaching 37 taels. Unexpectedly, speculators sold heavily, with Bingxing dumping, and Yuankangxiang vying to sell. In an instant, it plummeted by 15 taels, with no turning back. By 9:30, it was at 22 taels. When British gold opened, it was at 28 taels and a half. Due to the aggressive buying by Wanxing, Hengxing, Shunli, Yuanmao, and Yong, combined with the banks absorbing December British gold at 8125, but HSBC listing at half a penny higher, and US gold at 875, and Japanese gold down by 5 fen, it retreated to 22 taels. Later, due to the domestic market turning flat, banks traded near-term contracts at 6875, and distant contracts at 75, and absorbed October Japanese gold at 1 tael, 5 mace, and 6 fen. Then, the Dalian group hedged with strips, and Hengxing and Shengda aggressively bought, so in half an hour, it soared by 13 taels, with fluctuations of two or three taels. At 10 o'clock, it reached 35 taels. Afterwards, the fluctuations were irregular. At 10:30, it was at 28 taels, and at 10:45, it was at 32 taels and a half. The transactions were very chaotic. Later, news of an earthquake in Japan caused a great setback in morale. Japanese gold was sold for only 1 tael, 5 mace, and 5 fen. Speculators and dealers all dumped their holdings. By 11:20, it was at 24 taels. Afterwards, it rebounded by five or six taels, but from 11:30 to noon, there were advances and retreats of four taels. Indian exchange rates were reported at a large six annas. At closing, it was at 30 taels, then suppressed to 28-9 taels. The listed price was changed to 766 taels, 2 qian, a difference of 30 to 40 taels. The afternoon closed at 36-7 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market continued its disastrous decline. The afternoon market opened at 25 taels and a half, then at 28 taels. Sellers were very excited, and with the Indian exchange rate up another 18 annas, it immediately fell to 21 taels and a half. Soon after, it increased to 25 taels. After 2:10, the atmosphere became tense. Major players such as Wu and Luo were all selling. It was also rumored that Britain had banned the export of cash. British gold was offered by Mitsui and others at 1406.25. Then, Zhengjin offered 125, and North Korea and others offered 25 to 31.25. Therefore, in less than an hour, it plummeted by a huge 27 taels, showing an unfavorable trend. It suddenly broke the 700 tael mark, and by 3:00 it was 698 taels. However, Zhifeng, Yongda, and the Dalian group entered the market to buy, and Hengxing also bought steadily. Then, it rebounded upwards, but with fluctuations of four or five taels. The market was unstable and impossible to predict. At 4:00, it rose to 711 taels, but buyers were still widespread. But in five or six minutes, the price fell to a low of 704 taels again. At 4:15, it was at 08 taels. Unexpectedly, Shunli and Wanxing sold. At 4:30, the market closed at 06 taels, and then suppressed to 04 taels. Guangdong buyers entered, and it increased to 06 taels again. Compared to last Saturday (according to the listed price), it plummeted by more than 60 taels and 6 mace, an unexpected and disastrous fall. The difference during the day was 49 taels and a half. The goods were 45 taels in the morning market, 29 taels at noon closing, 26 taels and 5 in the afternoon, and 04 taels and 5 at the closing. The listed price showed a difference of 40 taels, and later 60 taels. Supplementary account deposits were 30 taels in the morning and 06 taels in the afternoon. Spot goods were barely available, with no trading.</p>
<p>Transactions were extremely chaotic. The transactions on the trading floor were extremely chaotic. According to statistics, Hengxing, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Yifeng Yong, Shunli, and Wanxing all bought. Hengxing Yuan, Senchang Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanxing Yong, Bingxing, Yongde, Yuankangxiang, Daifuxing Yong, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Cuichang Yong, Yan Yu, and Chengfeng Yong all sold. Speculators Wu and Luo both sold long positions. Japanese merchants covered last week's short positions. Yuantai, Yuanda Yong, Daxing Yong, and Yuanchun had many transactions. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Taifengcheng, Hengxing, and Shengda all bought, and those hedging British and Japanese gold also bought. Wanxing, Shunli, Cuichang Yong, Dadecheng, Yuancheng, Yongheng, Richang, Tongchun, Yifeng Yong, and Futaiheng and Yuantai all sold. Yuanxing Yong sold two or three thousand strips. Wu continued to sell a lot. Other transactions were difficult to track. The Dalian group bought first and then sold, mostly hedging. The Dalian strips involved 8,000 purchases and 5,000 sales. Guangdong buyers purchased 5,000 and sold 1,000.</p>

The Dalian group aggressively dumped a huge sum of five million yuan in Japanese gold, which had not been seen in a long time, to hedge gold.

<h3 id="e77">Drastic Changes in the Silver Dollar Market <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Impacted by Foreign Aggression... Public Panic Rises Greatly</p>
<p>Dollar Interest Rates Suddenly Soar... Silver Drafts and Clearing Fees Surge</p>
<p>The Market's Chaotic Situation: Yesterday morning, the market situation was still flat and uneventful. The market prices of silver dollars and silver bullion showed no movement. Unexpectedly, drastic changes occurred in the afternoon. Silver interest rates became very tight, exceeding the equilibrium line. Dollar interest rates also showed wild movement. According to inquiries, the changes were due to the impact of foreign aggression, causing public panic. Banks, for the sake of self-defense, tightened their silver interest rates. The commercial prospects of the northern groups were a hidden concern, and there was a possibility that action had to be taken. Therefore, silver drafts and clearing fees rose to new highs not seen this year. As for the changes in dollar interest rates, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications originally intended to purchase a large number of exchange heads, amounting to two or three million. Seeing that the market atmosphere was not good, with weak selling and very active buyers, it was difficult to close the market for a while. As a result, the closing was extended by three quarters of an hour, starting at 2:15. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, seeing that the situation was not good, stopped buying and strongly suppressed the market, preventing it from rising. Therefore, the dollar interest rate only rose by one cent. However, based on overall observations, the situation was not good, and it was feared that tightening would continue today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dollar and Draft Transaction Situation (Dollar Interest Rates): The dollar interest rate was still flat in the morning market, at 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, half. In the afternoon market, it suddenly changed wildly. It initially listed at 7 qian, 2 fen, 8-9 li. After several ups and downs, it was suppressed by the banks, closing at 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, half. However, it was still better than the morning market by 7 hao and a half. (Silver Drafts): It was 1 qian, 8 fen in the morning market. It suddenly rose by 1 qian in the afternoon market, reaching 2 qian, 8 fen. Bank listings were at 7 fen. Clearing fees increased significantly. At one point, it reached 3 qian, 2-3 fen. At closing, it was 2 qian, 7-8 fen. The situation was unusually tense. The Little Chamber of Commerce even made news, making remittance drafts. It was 1.29 million in the morning market and 2.55 million in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 120,000 in the morning market and 95,000 in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes were 245,000 in the morning market and 180,000 in the afternoon market.

<p>Securities Due to Japanese Occupation of Our Southern Manchuria</p>
<h3 id="e78">Unprecedented Plunge in the Securities Market <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Trading Halted at the Start of the Morning Due to a Sharp Decline</p>
<p>Afternoon Resumption Delayed</p>
<p>Significant Over-the-Counter Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday (21st), the bond market of the local Chinese Securities Exchange was extremely tense. Generally, people felt very uneasy. The Japanese had abandoned the rhetoric of peaceful coexistence and carried out a large-scale invasion, rapidly increasing their troops in the Northeast. They seized the important cities from Southern Manchuria to Qinhuangdao and all the border areas, seizing control and plundering everything, destroying all construction. The impact was unimaginable, causing widespread anxiety and fear in the market. The securities market experienced an unprecedented plunge. At the start of the morning, bonds experienced a surge of selling, universally plummeting, and repeatedly reaching the price limit and halting trading. At the opening, the trading of the current-month futures and demobilization 6, customs 19, customs 20, rolling tobacco tax, consolidated tax, salt tax, and disarmament 19 goodness September futures were all halted. In the next trading period, customs 9 also halted trading. Of those not previously halted, only disarmament 19 goodness October futures and 96 remained. In the afternoon, trading was delayed due to the collection of temporary additional security deposits. Brokers traded over-the-counter, but with no formal market, the over-the-counter prices trended towards stability. The attitude of the financial industry was good, buying some to maintain the market. A few large accounts also invested occasionally. Thus, other than a nearly one-yuan drop in the over-the-counter salt tax, others fluctuated by about half a yuan from the halted price. The market situation was somewhat stable. In addition, in the afternoon, news of a sudden earthquake in Japan, which caused a steep fall in the gold market, which was true, provided some comfort. At about 6 p.m., the market resumed, and the over-the-counter trading was firmer. At the opening, disarmament rose nearly one yuan, disarmament 19 goodness October futures rose by one yuan several jiao from the morning, and 96 also rose significantly. The market trend was still showing a continuous decline. Although the bond market seemed to have a slightly better turn, the future was still uncertain. There were no spot trades yesterday, but the total futures traded was more than 24.7 million yuan, including more than 10 million yuan in over-the-counter settlement and transfer trades. In the afternoon, actual trades of four types totaled only over one million yuan.</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants in Yarn Market Frantically Dump Stock</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced morning gains and afternoon losses, creating an unusually chaotic situation. In the morning session, due to the Japanese military's forceful occupation of Northeast China, there was deep fear of a radical donation campaign, causing widespread anxiety and strong buying interest. Concurrently, spot trading of native yarn picked up significantly. However, in the afternoon, due to volatile overseas market conditions, Japanese merchants massively dumped their holdings, causing the market to plummet by two or three taels. It is said that a major merchant bought a substantial amount.</p>
<p>Man-Marked Yarn Rose in the Morning but Fell in the Afternoon. The man-marked yarn market opened with enthusiasm in the morning session, with prices for all months rising by at least one tael. However, in the afternoon, Japanese merchants engaged in heavy selling, leading to a drop of two or three taels. A total of 60,150 bales were traded. Due to time constraints in the afternoon, it was not possible to record all transactions. It was noted that Dafu sold 850 bales, Yuda 2,350 bales, Daji 1,250 bales, Gengfeng 2,600 bales, Fuhe 1,000 bales, Changfeng 6,700 bales, and Yiyu 1,100 bales. Meiji bought 2,900 bales, Heshen 1,150 bales, Gongtai 1,850 bales, Ruidai 1,200 bales, Hengde 2,650 bales, Shenji 1,900 bales, Dachang 1,300 bales, and Deji 1,300 bales.

<p>Outlook Remains Ominous</p>
<p>The cotton market experienced a sharp decline, seemingly beyond control. This was mainly due to the continuous fall in American cotton prices for nine consecutive days, while local market prices remained stagnant. This was because merchants from Hubei and some cotton traders were holding long positions, refusing to let go, citing the severity of disasters across the country and the significant damage to cotton fields. Unexpectedly, gold prices plummeted, and American cotton prices further declined. As a result, the cost of imported cotton became significantly cheaper, and foreign firms offered particularly accommodating prices. Therefore, the longs found it difficult to maintain their positions, leading to a market crash. The outlook remains ominous.</p>
<p>Han-Marked Cotton Plummets by 1.8 Taels. The Han-marked cotton market opened with declines in the morning session, influenced by the falling American cotton prices and plummeting gold prices, resulting in a very weak market sentiment. Prices for all months fell by 1.2 taels. In the afternoon, prices fell another 0.7 or 0.8 taels. A total of 118,000 dans were traded in the morning session. Due to time constraints, afternoon transactions could not be recorded. It was noted that Gongtai sold 2,700 dans, Ruidai 10,500 dans, Shenji 2,200 dans, Changfeng 9,800 dans, Yiyu 4,800 dans, and Xiesheng 2,400 dans. Dafu bought 18,500 dans, Meiji 3,200 dans, Daji 1,900 dans, Gengfeng 2,600 dans, Dachang 2,700 dans, and Rixin Cheng 5,100 dans. The closing prices for Han-marked cotton are listed below:</p>

<p>Rice Market Decline Intensifies</p>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 30 boats carrying Western Route rice arrived at the Nantou Fengji Wharf. Due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival and the Japanese military's deployment, customer group purchases have ceased. Retail sales in this street are extremely slow, especially since Northern Rice opened at 16.5 yuan, with few buyers, resulting in a price drop of 20 cents. The price for goods from the Central Customs must be 30 to 40 cents. New Yanglu and Canjian rice prices have fallen by 40 cents. There is some trade in old rice, but the overall trend is a decline of 15 cents. The arrival and sale of new粳 rice are balanced, but there are still thick inventories, resulting in a drop of 20 cents. Early and late稻 rice prices remain stable, and retail sales are still decent, leading to a stable market. There is no loss or gain in silver dollars, presenting a遊象.</p>
<p>Twenty to thirty boats arrived at Xinzha yesterday. Sales in this street are in a slump. Changzhou, Wuxi, thick粳 high-quality and second-grade rice have decreased by almost 10 cents. New粳 and new Yangjian must be at least 30 cents lower. There is a sharp decline in early thin 稻田, but there are few transactions in medium and second grade goods. Although some customer groups have taken action on top-quality goods, prices have shrunk by 20 cents. Few old 蘆尖rice arrive, and sales are still good, but the situation is疲角許. Yesterday was Monday, the day for rice merchants from the city and county Yimiao Cuixiu Hall Rice Association to compare measures. More than fifty rice shops from the north and south markets arrived, with a total of about two hundred measures.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Imported Broken Rice Futures Plunge to Within 6 Taels <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Down 10 Cents from Last Week</p>
<p>The imported rice market was very sluggish yesterday. There were even fewer players in futures. However, due to the chaotic situation and the importance of rice as a staple food, spot prices remained firm. The Unified Market purchased 500 bags of Saigon rice imported by the 2nd branch of the Street Office, priced at 12.25 yuan. Futures firms are still soliciting business. Yuanli Foreign Firm telegraphed that 500 tons of Saigon rice were ready for immediate shipment, asking 6.5 taels, but no one inquired. There were also no local customers interested in returning goods. A transaction of 50 tons of September broken rice was completed, with the price falling to within 6.1 taels, at 5.95 taels, down 10 cents from last weekend's sales.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Marked Flour Trading Active, Market Weak <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market experienced significant fluctuations after opening in the morning. The opening prices were low, due to a reported decrease of 45 cents to 1-20 cents in imported wheat, and a sharp drop in gold prices of 20-30 taels due to the invasion of the eastern neighbor. This was expected to create a trend. As a result, the opening price for the current month was as low as 2 taels and 5 cents. However, short covering was very active, and some people believed that if war broke out between China and Japan, all the already purchased foreign wheat would have problems. Therefore, there were many who temporarily bought in, and the market turned from weakness to strength. The rebound in each segment was also very impressive, with a fluctuation of 20 to 30 cents from the lowest point. This was mainly due to the shorts scrambling to cover. In the afternoon, the market became weak again due to reports of a significant earthquake in Japan and a sharp fall in gold prices. However, shorts mostly engaged in closing positions, so trading was very active, with the total volume reaching over 1.8 million bags. Recently, sales in the north have temporarily stopped due to the Japanese invasion, so the near-term outlook is not optimistic. As a result, the September contract fell 7.5 cents from the previous day, the October contract fell 7.5 cents, the November contract fell 1 cent, the December contract fell 7.5 cents, the January contract fell 2.5 cents, and the February contract fell 7.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Wheat Futures Market Turns Weak in the Afternoon <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw fluctuations in the morning. Although the prices of imported wheat continued to fall, and the gold market saw a sharp decline, most nervous people thought that the Japanese atrocities had occurred and that the source of foreign wheat might be affected. This suspicion caused people's sentiment to rebound, and the opening prices of each segment once jumped by 40 to 50 cents. However, as buyers returned in large numbers, and the sharp fall in gold prices could not be ignored, the prices of each segment gradually declined again. As a result, the closing prices were similar to those of the previous week. In the afternoon, the sentiment that had been strong in the morning turned weak, and the gold market fell sharply again, naturally causing people's sentiment to weaken. Trading in each segment was vigorous, unprecedented in recent times, as both longs and shorts rushed to close positions. Therefore, although the environment was not good, the market did not fall sharply. As a result, the September and October contracts fell 2 cents from the previous weekend, the November and December contracts fell 3 cents, the January contract fell 3 cents, and the February contract fell 2 cents. The spot wheat market saw active trading, with second-grade goods falling to 3.4 taels, and high-quality goods reaching 60 cents. More than 5,000 bags of wheat from Gaoyou, Zhenjiang, Qintong, Yangzhou, and Kunshan were opened.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Soybeans Surge <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a significant change in the soybean market. Because soybeans are a specialty of Northeast China, and now the Northeast has suddenly suffered a national crisis, cutting off the source, there was great panic in the market. Underground prices have risen significantly. Soybean futures on the exchange rose about 30 cents, and oil also rose 35 cents.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Swire Sugar Suddenly Opens 7,000 Bags</p>
<p>Raw and White Sugar Plunge by 20 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market communications indicated that no Cuban, New York, or Javanese sugar was arriving. The association's pricing has become weaker due to the declining exchange rates. Demand is becoming increasingly scarce. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 raw and white sugar for new goods has fallen sharply to 11.4 taels, a steep decline of 20 cents. No. 20 new medium sand white sugar is at 11 taels, and No. 9 Dutch red sugar is at 9.4 taels. Trading is sparse, and the trend is also flat. Swire Sugar spot goods opened with 7,000 bags, B mark price at 5.05 yuan, HX mark at 4.9 yuan, HM mark at 4.7 yuan, H mark at 4.6 yuan, with taxes paid upon import. Demand is quite strong, and the market is very lively. Goods ready for immediate shipment are also opening with more than 20,000 bags, with the same prices, but subject to confirmation from Hong Kong. Spot pricing has therefore been lowered. B mark is offered at 12 taels, BY mark at 11.95 taels, and HM mark at 11.55 taels, but there are no inquiries. The number of trades is very sparse. A new factory sold 302 bags of spot raw and white sugar, with coarse grains and a high color, priced at 11.4 taels, and the market is very lively.</p>
<p>New Quanzhou Soaked Round Longans Arriving in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Land Prices are High</p>
<p>Due to the poor harvest of this year's new Quanzhou large soaked longans, the total amount is only about 30% of last year's, so land prices are very high. According to reports, top-grade large grains require nearly 60 taels, which is the opposite of the Shanghai market. The first batch of only three to four hundred boxes has already been shipped from the source and can arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. There are no Longkou vermicelli available for the recent shipment. The cargo was opened at 23.5 taels, and the market price was called at 24 taels, but no transaction was made. However, the trend is quite tight.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Yixing Autumn Cocoons Not Discounted Much</p>
<p>Drying Discount: 280-290 Catties; Reeling Discount: 430-440 Catties. In recent years, cocoon production in Yixing has become increasingly poor due to the impact of unfavorable weather. This year, most autumn silkworm farmers bred improved varieties. During the major sleep stage, rainwater caused problems. Although cocoon production is only about 40%, the cocoon quality is better. The average drying discount is only 380-390 catties, and the reeling discount is 430-440 catties. The new autumn cocoons are currently being dried and transported to Shanghai one after another.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm tea market suddenly turned quiet. British and French firms, due to the Japanese invasion of our country, initially caused a sharp rise, but their attitude turned to wait-and-see. Only Gongxi had some transactions in the whole city, and the rest were sparse.</p>
<p>Hardware: English White Iron Sales Smooth</p>
<p>English white iron trading has been very smooth recently because construction groups are enthusiastically purchasing. For example, yesterday, more than 200 dans of No. 31 were opened at a price of 16.75 taels, more than 100 dans of No. 28 were opened at a price of 17 taels, and 70-80 dans each of No. 26 and No. 24 were opened, with No. 26 at 15.75 taels and No. 24 at 14.75 taels. However, investigations show that local inventories are very depleted, so the market is expected to continue to improve.</p>

The military and police authorities are taking a calm attitude to maintain order, so that the Japanese have no excuse. The various news heard yesterday is compiled as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e90">City Party Headquarters Decides on Anti-Japanese Plan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>

<h3 id="e91">City Party Headquarters' Telegram to the Central Executive Committee <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Troop Deployment to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters sent an urgent telegram to the Central Executive Committee yesterday regarding the Japanese military's invasion and occupation of Manchuria. (Omitted salutations) Japanese imperialism has been scheming for a long time to seize the East. This time, taking advantage of our natural disasters and bandit troubles, they suddenly deployed troops, forcefully occupied the East, peered into Pingjin, and attempted to invade Jiaoji, brutally killing our people, burning and looting our homes, capturing our military and civilian leaders, and robbing our barracks and factories. They regard justice as worthless and human life as grass. Their wild nature and atrocities are like madness. Anyone with life and breath can no longer tolerate it. Our national army has compromised in every way, without any resistance. This is not enough to slightly move their pity or restrain their wild ambitions. Our Central Government, with its insight into the overall situation, will certainly take the most appropriate means and the most effective response. Specifically, I silently observe the people's feelings are aroused, righteous indignation is difficult to suppress, and in addition to my sorrow, I dare to offer my humble advice. I hope the Assembly will follow the Prime Minister's teachings, lead the whole people, and devote itself to the revolution, with the sole purpose of seeking China's freedom and equality. But now, the oppression of freedom and inequality imposed on our compatriots by foreign races is even worse than before. Protecting the country and defending the people, defending against aggression, depends solely on the national army. Since our country has suffered such a humiliation, even if we strive for retreat, there must be a limit to retreat. Even if we are willing to be slaughtered, we should choose the method of slaughter. Knowing that the country is declining and collapse is worrying, we have some reluctance, which will disrupt the overall plan. But now, how can this be called a small matter? If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Rather than waiting to die with our hands tied, why not fight for survival? Rather than being slowly tortured and wailing, why not cut our throats and commit suicide? As the saying goes, a scholar can be killed, but not humiliated. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for the country. Shall we remain silent and wait for foreign aid? Then the great powers will not help a country that does not express its autonomy. Shall we call out for international justice? Then justice is not set up for a nation that has no courage. Shall we delay the time in preparation for an alliance under the city? Then the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 must first go through the war of 1894. Alas, Serbia is but a small country that has never yielded to the iron hoof of Austria. Turkey is also called a sick man, but it has never yielded to the gunboats of Greece. India is controlled by Britain, but the spirit of resisting Britain is still there. Korea has already fallen to Japan, but the efforts to oppose Japan have not diminished. Today, the whole country, from top to bottom, is truly calm, but how is this different from willingly becoming subjugated people? Tolerance is truly tolerant, but how is this different from being a prisoner awaiting execution? If this continues, all countries will follow suit. Not only will our country no longer become an independent country, but also we will have no face to be people who steal life. Therefore, rather than swallowing our voices and dying, why not take up arms and die for our lives? I urge the Assembly to carefully consider the gains and losses and preside over the overall plan, on the one hand, to urge the Guangdong side to realize the truth and complete the peaceful unification, and on the other hand, to change the policy of non-resistance, resolutely mobilize large forces, and quickly recover the lost territories, deploy heavy troops to protect the ports, even if our territory is again trampled and our people are further slaughtered, it may be that the world and future generations will know that the Chinese people still have this last heroic act. Moreover, how could our sick man of the East never have a Kemal Pasha? And how could our Chinese Kuomintang never reach the young Kuomintang of Turkey? If the Assembly truly makes a decisive decision and issues a nationwide order, all my comrades and compatriots will pledge to support the Central Government, either as a backup or as a vanguard, and will go through fire and water without hesitation, and will not look back on this matter. The telegram is urgent, and I hope you will understand. Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City Executive Committee Horse Seal.</p>

<p>Nominating Hu Shuhua and Others as Committee Members</p>
<p>At 2 PM yesterday, colleagues in the education sector of this city convened responsible personnel from large, medium, and small schools throughout the city as initiators at the Municipal Education Bureau on Daji Road to discuss response methods.

<p>Has Ordered Ambassadors to Foreign Countries to Publicize</p>
<p>When the Diplomatic Discussion Meeting was held on the 19th, the shocking news from the Northeast was suddenly heard, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was immediately telegraphed to inquire about the truth. Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed a reply to Shanghai, which is recorded below: Shanghai Office transfers to the Diplomatic Discussion Meeting. The Ministry has received the confidential telegram. There are confirmed reports that the Japanese military has occupied Shenyang and Andong. The situation in Changchun and other places is not yet known from official telegrams. This Japanese military action is deliberately disrupting peace in East Asia and violating international treaties and the Non-Aggression Pact. The Ministry has submitted an urgent and serious proposal to Japan, requesting the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops, and has telegraphed Representative Shi to the League of Nations and the embassies in all countries that signed the Non-Aggression Pact, ordering them to publicize this matter as much as possible and liaise with the governments of the countries where they are stationed.

<h3 id="e94">Silver and Money Industry Telegrams Request Cessation of Conflict and Unity Against Foreign Aggression <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Stating Three Points in the Telegram</p>
<p>Requesting an Immediate End to Infighting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local silver and money industries convened a temporary emergency meeting to discuss the issue of Japan. As a result, at this time of national crisis, nothing less than domestic unity is enough to resist the violent Japanese. Therefore, they sent out a most urgent telegram to various parties: "Most Urgent: National Government Chairman Chiang, Ministers of all Ministries, Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping, Wang Zhaoming, Zhang Zhesheng, Tang Shaochuan, Xu Ruwei, Gu Xiangqin, Chen Bonan, and other gentlemen from Guangzhou, please note: As alarming news spreads, the Japanese military has dared to risk a major taboo and attacked various places in Liaoning. The whole city is shocked, and our sorrow and anger are extreme. I believe that if we do not strive to survive today, the country will no longer be a country, let alone anything else. Therefore, I sincerely appeal and ask you to pay attention to the following three points: (1) Brotherly infighting is most unfortunate. Immediately cease fighting in order to resist foreign aggression; (2) Unite as one, abandon past grievances, share the same hatred against the enemy, and relieve the national crisis; (3) Notify the whole country, act with calm, and unite the government and the people to save the critical situation. The two public associations are mindful of the rise and fall of the country, and everyone is responsible. Therefore, I dare to send this telegram to you, asking you to make a decisive decision, gather the virtuous and outstanding people from all over the country, convene a meeting, and jointly reverse the tide. This is it. Otherwise, danger and destruction are imminent, and intact eggs are difficult to hope for. Where is the personality of the revolutionaries? The independent sovereignty is completely lost. Gentlemen, you bear heavy responsibilities. How will you face the people? The telegram is fearful, and I earnestly state my words. I hope you will understand and accept it. I am extremely grateful. Shanghai Bankers' Association and Money Industry Association together kowtow, Ma."</p>
<h3 id="e95">Yesterday's Telegram from the Anti-Japanese Association Urges the Guangdong Faction <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>To Eliminate Disagreements and Seek National Unity</p>
<p>To Cease Hostilities and Jointly Confront National Crisis</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Anti-Japanese Association telegraphed the Guangdong faction, saying, "Transmitted by various newspapers for the public's knowledge nationwide, a telegram was sent to Guangzhou, which states: 'Like a bolt from the blue, Japan, taking advantage of our vulnerability, has dispatched heavy troops to occupy our Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, and other places. Half of the northeastern territory has already fallen under the trampling hooves of Japanese cavalry. This barbaric action sets an unprecedented example in world history. We, at this critical juncture where the survival of the nation hangs by a thread, cannot restrain ourselves and dare to make this bloody appeal to all of you. This time, Japan's atrocities directly aim to destroy the Chinese nation. If we still have the concept of "nation" in our hearts, then all internal suspicions and grievances should be eliminated. To resolve disagreements is to yield for the sake of the nation, not for oneself; to compromise for the sake of the whole is to secure the nation, not oneself. Siblings harming each other is despised by gentlemen; the ruin of a nest means the destruction of the eggs, a fact known even to women and children. We earnestly hope that you will cease hostilities, return to the fold, and jointly face the national crisis, halt military actions, and unite against external enemies. Each day peace arrives sooner means one more piece of land preserved; a moment's delay means immediate collapse. If there is no Wu Sangui to complete the act of treachery, then we must not speak lightly of surrender. We present these urgent words in this telegram, respectfully requesting your consideration and acceptance.' Special telegram is sent to inform all compatriots nationwide, urging them to rise bravely, unite as one, embrace the greatest sacrifice, and wage effective resistance. The continuation or extinction of the nation's lifeblood truly depends on this." The Anti-Japanese and Aid Overseas Chinese Committee of All Circles in Shanghai respectfully submits, Ma.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Chu Minyi's Telegram Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Advocates Convening an Emergency National Salvation Conference</p>
<p>Hopes Key Figures in Beijing and Guangdong Will Set Aside Grievances for the Sake of the Nation</p>
<p>Central Committee member Chu Minyi is extremely indignant at Japan's recent atrocities and advocates that at this critical moment for the nation, all factions should unite their strength, and the entire country, from top to bottom, should be of one mind to devise countermeasures. The telegrams are recorded below as follows:</p>
<p>To Guangdong's Gu, Wang, and Sun, and to Xiangqin, Jingwei, and Zhesheng, as well as all comrades for consideration: "I have just returned to Shanghai from the Northwest after attending a funeral, only to learn that the floods in various provinces have become an unprecedented disaster. When the entire country should be united in rescue efforts, the two Guangdong provinces are launching a military expedition to Hunan. The news of this has caused me deep dismay. Later, I learned that Shi, Zeng, Puquan, and Tiecheng have telegraphed an appeal for peace, and the troops entering Hunan will immediately retreat. I also admire the unchanging original intention of peace held by Gong and others. Today, Japan occupies Shenyang and carries out armed aggression. The survival of the nation hangs in the balance. National public opinion unanimously advocates ending internal strife and uniting against external enemies. I especially hope that the core members of our party will set aside old grievances, unite as one, and jointly resist foreign aggression. I believe that you also feel that the nation is in dire straits and cannot tolerate further disputes. The situation is critical, and at this moment of crisis, party unity brooks no further conditions. I hope you will immediately abandon petty resentments and jointly face the national crisis, and come to Shanghai immediately to hold an emergency national salvation conference with comrades here to jointly devise a plan to save the situation. I have telegraphed Li, Zhang, and Wu in Beiping and comrades in Beijing, sharing the same views, and asking them to come to Shanghai for a meeting. Tracing back to the unfortunate internal division of our party, the idea of governing the country by the party has already aroused suspicion among the people. If we do not seek unity in this critical period of national survival, the consequences will be unbearable to mention. Later generations will surely say that we destroyed the nation through our party. Thinking of this, my heart aches deeply. I urgently present these words and await your clear instructions." Chu Minyi respectfully submits, Ma.</p>

<p>Telegrams U.S. Authorities to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>U.S. is the First Advocate of the Peace Pact</p>
<p>This Act of Aggression Must Be Strongly Suppressed</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen, Chen Guangfu, Guo Bingwen, Xia Peng, Shou Jingwei, Dong Xian Guang, and others of the China Committee of the China Institute in America, convened an emergency meeting yesterday to address Japan's incursion into the Northeast. They resolved to telegraph the U.S. Secretary of State, the Senate and House of Representatives, the chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committees, and leaders from all walks of life, appealing for the upholding of international justice and the maintenance of the Peace Pact. They stated, in brief: "Japan is taking advantage of our country's rampant Red bandits, severe floods, and the economic panic and unemployment problems plaguing various countries to forcibly occupy the Northeast and engage in reckless arson and plunder. Their premeditation has been long in the making, and their methods are even more brutal and despicable than when they took advantage of Europe's preoccupation during the Great War to present the Twenty-One Demands, which were a barbaric request to China. The United States is the first advocate of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Regarding this kind of violent act that violates the pact and tramples on friendly nations, we urge you to uphold justice and strongly suppress it. Only then can the ambitions of the Japanese militarists be slightly curbed, and world peace will not be shattered by this evil precedent. Otherwise, the Peace Pact will be reduced to mere waste paper, international morality will be swept away, and the thorns ahead will cause endless pain. As for Japan's excuses, they claim that this incident was caused by Chinese troops destroying the railway tracks, and then they claim that it was caused by Chinese troops blowing up the railway bridge. However, people in the Tokyo government suddenly believe that it was done by Japanese rogue elements in the military. All sorts of evasions further reveal the hidden conspiracy and premeditation of the Japanese militarists, which has been brewing for more than just a day or two. The government of that country should bear full responsibility, yet diplomatic figures from that country still want to use the trick of counter-propaganda to deceive the eyes and ears of friendly nations and confuse the people's</p>

<p>understanding. It is hoped that all sectors in the United States will see through their deception and not be deceived, uphold justice, and curb their ferocity. The future of Sino-US relations will be fortunate, and the future of international peace will be fortunate," and so on.</p>

<p>Front-Line Troops Swear to Fight to the Death Without Turning Back</p>
<p>Lai Xinhui, the commander of the Sichuan Army, is known for his skill in battle. He came to Shanghai for recuperation during the summer and resided in a private residence on Rue Massenet in the French Concession. Ever since the bad news of Japan's occupation of Liaoning came, Lai has been extremely indignant. Yesterday, he sent a special telegram to the Central Government, saying: "To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanchang Front, Director of the Hankou Headquarters He, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanchang Chen Group, Chairman Liu of Kaifeng, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison Xiong, Mayor Zhang, Mr. Wang Jingwei in Guangzhou, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Tang Mengxiao, Mr. Bai Jian, Mr. Zhang Xianghua, Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, and Mr. Gu Xiangqin for consideration: The Japanese have occupied our territory with barbaric actions, setting an unprecedented evil example in the international community and breaking the peace jointly guaranteed by the world. This cannot be resolved through reason and law. It is undeniable that we are poor and weak, but there is no reason to sit idly by and await death. As evidenced by past events, when England invaded Duránce, the entire country was mobilized, yet Duránce still resisted for several years. Similarly, when France and Spain invaded Morocco, the two countries combined their strength, but Morocco also fought back for many years. Both Duránce and Morocco are small, insignificant places. Even if we are a hundred times weaker, comparing our strength, we are still ten or a hundred times stronger than Japan. Why should we fear a mere Japan? As the ancients said, success or failure depends on future actions. We must be able to attack before we can talk about defending, and we must be able to fight before we can talk about peace. There has never been a case where one can survive by sitting idly by and relying solely on the upholding of justice by onlookers. This principle is very clear. At this critical time of survival, there is absolutely no room for hesitation or procrastination. We should ask the Central Government to resolutely and decisively make preparations for a national mobilization. I, Xinhui, have spent half my life in the military and have a small reputation for battlefield matters. I will charge ahead and fight to the death, with no turning back. This urgent telegram is sent, awaiting your instructions." Lai Xinhui respectfully submits, Ma.</p>

<p>Concentrate Police Force to Maintain Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command, in accordance with the Central Government's instructions regarding Japan's large-scale invasion of the Eastern Provinces, strictly ordered its subordinate units to remain calm and await a proper resolution. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to the troops stationed along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, as well as the troops stationed in Shanghai, to comply with the following: (1) Strengthen security within the garrison area and strictly order troops to avoid conflicts with the Japanese; (2) Strictly protect Japanese residents; (3) Sincerely hope that the people will maintain their patriotic fervor with a spirit of perseverance and refrain from acting outside the law, so that the Japanese have no excuse to exploit; (4) Strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>Police Contingent Parade Canceled</p>
<p>Strictly Orders Subordinate Units to Remain Calm</p>
<p>Do Not Give Japanese Any Excuse to Exploit</p>
<p>The police contingent under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau was originally established to provide extra security and temporary deployment during emergencies to increase police force. It is customary to hold a grand parade once a year. This year, it was scheduled to be held on the Double Tenth National Day. However, due to the Liaoning incident, in order to stabilize public sentiment and consolidate public order, the municipal authorities have ordered the public security bureaus in various districts to redouble their efforts in patrolling and protecting stores and residents of Chinese and foreign nationals. The Public Security Bureau has also assigned various squadrons of the police contingent to the jurisdictions of various district bureaus to jointly undertake patrol and protection work, in order to ensure thoroughness and peace for the people. Therefore, the parade of the police contingent for this year's Double Tenth Festival has been ordered to be canceled so that they can concentrate on their mission.</p>

<p>Will Not Trade with Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Will Not Report or Load Japanese Ships</p>
<p>The Beishi Office of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association convened an emergency meeting of all members yesterday. More than 30 people attended the meeting. Chairman Fu Qian'geng reported that this year's floods have caused disasters, and the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province have turned into swamps. Even in the higher areas, the harvest has been reduced. The city's food problem cannot be solved without purchasing foreign rice. However, Japan, taking advantage of our country's severe flood disaster, using the Nakamura incident as an excuse, has dispatched a large army to invade the Northeast, trampling on Shenyang and wantonly ravaging it, regarding our country as meat on the chopping board, with the intention of swallowing it. The members of our industry are members of the nation, and the nation and the family are all closely related. We should rise up and jointly resist foreign aggression. Considering that our industry only purchases foreign rice and does not trade with Japanese merchants or load Japanese ships, there is no other contact with Japanese merchants. In the future, we will boycott Japanese merchants for the foreign rice purchased and the ships loaded by our members. Please discuss and make a public decision, etc. The original proposal was unanimously adopted. In the future, all members must resolutely boycott Japanese merchants for the foreign rice purchased and the ships loaded, and avenge the national humiliation.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of the First District Party Branch Notifies All Compatriots Nationwide: Japan has long coveted our Manchuria and Mongolia. Their meticulous planning has not been a matter of just one day. This time, they have suddenly ripped off the mask of false goodwill and revealed their ferocious true colors, slaughtering our soldiers and civilians and occupying our territory to achieve their ambition of annexation. All of our citizens are filled with anger and stand on end their hair. With the national crisis at hand, there is no turning back. As the saying goes, "Things must rot from within before worms can breed." Internal strife is enough to invite foreign aggression. For the present, all compatriots nationwide should unite as one to jointly face the national crisis. Do not engage in fratricidal strife or internal conflicts. Otherwise, if the country is about to perish, what is the point of fighting over territory? If the whole country can unite and devote all its efforts to dealing with Japan, why should we fear their coercion? The survival of the nation rests on this one action. Urgent words are presented, may you all consider them.</p>
<p>The Eighth District Party Branch Telegraphed Urgently: All Shanghai Newspapers for Transmission to All Compatriots: The insidious and venomous nature of Japanese imperialism is evident. Anyone with even a little bit of backbone cannot help but grit their teeth and hate them. Old humiliations and new hatreds are vividly before our eyes. The corpses of the Korean massacre have not yet dried, and now they are using military force to occupy my Pan Yang City, forcibly disarming the troops of my Beida Camp, and destroying my arsenal and the Beining Railway, etc. When the news came, the pain was unbearable. Such trampling on our territory and disregard for justice is clearly revealed. Considering the peril of our motherland and the loss of our rivers and mountains, alas, my compatriots, can this be tolerated? What cannot be endured? At this moment, there is no way to save ourselves other than eliminating internal strife, uniting as one, and jointly seeking external resistance. Lamenting the national crisis at hand and worrying about the imminent demise of the nation, we urge the whole country to rise up and urgently seek resistance, overthrow tyranny, and save the motherland. Urgent telegram, I cannot wait to be ordered, The Shanghai Special City Eighth District Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang bows. The County Party Headquarters Will Hold a Meeting Today. The Shanghai County Party Headquarters is scheduled to convene people from all walks of life today to discuss the issue of Japan. It has also sent a letter to the City Party Headquarters requesting it to order all entertainment venues in Shanghai to suspend entertainment from today onwards. The Journalists' Union's Message to the People of the Country. Workers, compatriots, our international China has been invaded and oppressed by imperialism for many years and there have been countless times. In the history of China over the last hundred years there has never been a page which hasn't been tainted by the disgrace of trampling, no page which isn't blood and flesh flying about. China's been invaded and oppressed by Japanese imperialism for many years, many times too. Since the Sino-Japanese war in the Qing Dynasty, the May Fourth Movement, the May Thirtieth Tragedy, the Jinan Tragedy and up to the recent Wanbaoshan Tragedy and this time of sending troops to South Manchuria and forcibly occupying places like Shenyang, Changchun and Jilin, there hasn't been one time when China hasn't suffered extreme shame, not one time we've received half a solution. Although in name Japan and China have separately held to independent relations for decades, in reality Japan has long become the suzerain state and China has become a colony. Japan is close to China's northern provinces, especially in Manchuria, separated from Japan only by sea, and from Korea across only a river, so that in time Japan is allowed extreme convenience in executing its policy of aggression, while the Manchurian areas are rich in produce, the depository of China's natural wealth, how can this fail to raise the covetous eyes of Japanese imperialism, so from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, from the Sino-Japanese War to the Wanbaoshan Tragedy, every time it happened in the north, every time it was a direct looting of China's northern wealth and occupation of northern land, other than the cutting up of Taiwan and Ryukyu, places like the forcible occupation of Sakhalin Island, Korea, Lushun Port, Dalian Bay, Qingdao, Jinan, not one wasn't a wealth center of northern China, while the group of crazy traitors in the north has always been under the patronage and cultivation of Japanese imperialists, very loyal as its running dogs, Manchuria has long been Japan's sphere of influence, has long become Japan's territory, but in name it still counts as China's national territory only, in the period of capitalism developing to the final stage, economic panic is happening successively in every country, the reason for their panic cannot lie outside the excess of production, what way could there be to save this excess of production other than expanding colonies, that is expanding the market for selling goods, there's no better method. Japan is a powerful and strong imperialist of the world, the crisis of its internal collapse is as deep and massive as every other country, to maintain its lingering breath, it only actively executes aggression, the three eastern provinces have always been under Japanese aggression, always have been Japan's only overseas market for selling its goods, but in name it's a part of China's map, everywhere they must keep the mask of not infringing on China's sovereignty, everywhere they cannot carry out looting in a very brazen way, and at any time there's the risk of other countries competing with it, this time the Wanbaoshan Tragedy and using the pretext of the Nakamura Incident to occupy South Manchuria by force, they wanted to monopolize the three eastern provinces, afterwards to proceed with aggression even more distinctly, such are the facts. What's called the Nakamura Incident and the South Manchuria Railway being destroyed are just some ways of covering up their crimes, very heartbreaking, the Wanbaoshan incident hadn't been resolved yet and this thing suddenly happened, news from every aspect tells us that the actions of the Japanese imperialists were not less barbaric than robbers, and at the present moment of such urgency, they just adhere to a policy of calmness and non-resistance, stubbornly letting the Japanese army kill, loot and pillage, letting them have the territory of thousands of miles, this is a scene that's never been seen in the shame of any country ever, Japan like this, barbaric, invading China, is a rare thing for the world to see, China obediently suffering the cruelty of Japanese robbers is unheard of since ancient times, and as it is, can China not perish? For the last four or five years, the anti-imperialist movement has gone down under the horizon, but the oppression and aggression of imperialism has not only not been reduced, rather it's increased day by day, the main reason for this is the result of civil war, continual civil wars have buried countless people, and invited unprecedented natural disasters and the pressure of economic bankruptcy, one side under the direct slaughter and trampling of imperialism, the pains of life have long reached the point of being unable to bear, this time the Japanese occupying the three eastern provinces by force is precisely telling us that the road of death is before our eyes, we should fold back from the road of death and resolve ourselves out of pain, then be brave, resolute, unite and fight to the death with the Japanese robbers, restore our inherent national spirit, destroy all the evil forces that poison the Chinese people, oppose all internal strife, what use is passive resistance? the official style of shouting, is a foolish action that doesn't solve anything, and non-resistance is just another name for surrender, the workers and compatriots of all China, to find a way out of the extreme situation, to liberate our own nations, to liberate our own suffering, unite quickly, face together the fierce and wild Japanese, make this declaration, the 21st day of the ninth month of the twentieth year,</p>
<p>Expressions from various organizations. The Two-Roads Industrial Workers' Union, the City Letterpress Printing Industry Union, the Steamboat Wood Industry Union, the Seamen's Union, the Pharmaceutical Industry Occupational Union, the Postal Workers' Union, the Postal Employees' Union, various citizen groups in the French Concession, the Department Store Industry Association, the Knitting Industry Association, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the National Labor University, the Student Self-Government Association of Daxia University and the district branches of the school, etc., all have proposals and telegrams for uniting against foreign enemies. Due to length, these are omitted.</p>
<p>Commentary from the Ta Mei Evening News. Yesterday, the Ta Mei Evening News commented on the Japanese military's atrocities in Manchuria, stating briefly: "The Japanese military's occupation of Shenyang overnight, consolidation of its military position throughout Manchuria, disarmament of Chinese troops, concentration of troops on the Korean border, and dispatch of warships to various ports in North China are actions that naturally constitute acts of war. Only the most foolish can believe that they are merely local incidents arising solely from the protection of a section of the railway. Moreover, the claim that the railway was destroyed has not yet been verified. Even as reported, if it was destroyed at 10:30 p.m. on Friday night, it must have been repaired immediately, so there was no disruption to the South Manchuria Railway's schedule. If trains can run as usual, then there must be no disturbance outside the railway area. Therefore, even according to the Japanese report, it is clear that the Japanese military has mobilized its forces based on a theoretical incident to occupy the area. The true reason is that Japan has decided not to resolve the outstanding issues with China through diplomatic negotiations and believes that European and American countries are too preoccupied with their own affairs to criticize its violation of the Open Door Policy, breach of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and disregard for the Nine-Power Treaty. However, whether Japan's hopes can be fulfilled remains to be seen. In short, the opinions of other countries cannot be ignored. Now, Tokyo's declaration seeks to create the impression that the occupation of Shenyang was the result of overzealous actions by resident military officers and not the intention of the Japanese government's foreign policy. However, for Japan's sake, the only truly effective foreign declaration at present is in deeds, not empty words. The only way is to immediately withdraw the Japanese troops from the newly occupied areas, immediately negotiate compensation for damages in areas outside the railway area, and apologize for actions that exceeded the normal limits of police powers. However, all of this seems unlikely to be done by Japan at this time. If this incident is indeed the result of Japanese militarists acting without government control, then Japan, which usually criticizes China's lack of control over its government troops, is now repeating the same mistake. How weak is its government's power! Japan's insistence on its special status in Manchuria is an old refrain. Its declaration that it does not want third parties to interfere may violate the Nine-Power Treaty to maintain the status quo in Manchuria and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In the future, even if Europe and America, as Japan expects, do not have time to pay attention to the disputes in the Far East, its victory in Manchuria will ultimately be difficult to achieve as it envisions. Because if Japan seizes any rights in China, it will only further consolidate the position of other countries in the Far East. Those foreigners in China who express sympathy for Japan can take Korea and Taiwan as a warning," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Severely Punish Zhang Bingsheng <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Robbing Confiscated Japanese Goods</p>
<p>And Committing Violence While Drunk</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the Anti-Japanese Association of this city has been working very hard in recent days. Inspections are especially strict in the Ning-Shao port area. However, some good merchants, due to the increase in confiscated goods and the loss of capital, do not hesitate to be blinded by profit. Zhang Bingsheng, a shareholder of the Daxin Transportation Company, usually specializes in transporting Japanese goods as his business. A few days ago, he transported more than ten pieces of Japanese goods to the North Station, which were confiscated by the Anti-Japanese Association. Zhang then invited Lu Bingzhang, who claimed to be the head of the defense corps, to lead dozens of hooligans to forcibly rob several pieces. He also threatened that if the goods were confiscated again, he would either beat the inspectors to death or gouge out the eyes of Zhang Gang, the director of the Zhabei inspection department. Yesterday, Zhang again gathered dozens of thugs, first drinking heavily in a restaurant, and then broke into the Anti-Japanese Association, regardless of the situation, beating everyone they encountered. Fortunately, the Anti-Japanese Association's special team received the news and rushed to the scene. The thugs, seeing the situation was not good, fled in all directions. However, Zhang was still not sober and continued to curse and look for people to beat. He was then arrested. The Inspection Section reported the situation to the Standing Committee. At that time, the 17th meeting was being held, and everyone agreed that Zhang Bingsheng dared to lead thugs to attack the Anti-Japanese Association during this tense period of anti-Japanese sentiment and must be severely punished. However, Zhang was still not sober, so they decided to wait until he sobered up before handling the matter.</p>

<p>At the last general meeting, the National Government's Flood Relief Committee decided to allocate 300,000 yuan in relief funds to Jiangsu Province. Under the supervision of Cheng Jingsheng, the Jiangsu Commissioner, the funds were distributed according to the severity of the disaster in various counties of Jiangsu Province as follows: Xinghua, 40,000 yuan; Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Taixian, Baoying, Dongtai, and Yancheng, 30,000 yuan each; Jiangpu, Liuhe, Yixing, and Wujiang, 5,000 yuan each; Liyang, 4,000 yuan; Lishui and Gaochun, 3,000 yuan each.

<p>Funing's floodwaters continue to rise. A telegram was received from the Funing County Relief Branch and Flood Relief Aftermath Branch stating: (Above omitted) After the two telegrams from Hui and Tan, in just a few days, the water level continued to rise by one or two feet due to the concentration of water in the downstream areas. Counting the previous rise, it exceeds one zhang (ten feet). The disaster area has increased to include districts 2, 3, 6, 8, and 12, bringing the total to eleven districts, covering nine-tenths of the entire county. Despite sending teams to hire workers for rescue and setting up shelters in different districts, many still lack assistance, and even those rescued face difficulties in recovery. Apart from requesting Mr. Hao, a philanthropic gentleman, to urgently provide 10,000 yuan for relief, the severity and extent of the disaster, combined with the poverty of the area and the lack of self-help capacity, necessitates sending more personnel with substantial funds to conduct rescues by different routes, so that the people who have suffered a major calamity may feel revived. (Below omitted)</p>
<p>Actual Situation of Disaster in Jiangning: Jiangning County has a total of ten districts. Except for districts 3 and 8, where the disaster situation is slightly less severe, the inundated area in the first district is approximately 94,730 mu (about 15,620 acres); the inundated area in the second district is approximately 4,680 mu (about 770 acres); the inundated area in the fourth district is approximately 124,250 mu (about 20,500 acres); the inundated area in the fifth district is approximately 72,340 mu (about 11,930 acres); the inundated area in the sixth district is approximately 152,840 mu (about 25,240 acres); the inundated area in the seventh district is approximately 32,150 mu (about 5,300 acres); the inundated area in the ninth district is approximately 69,000 mu (about 11,380 acres); and the inundated area in the tenth district is approximately 70,000 mu (about 11,550 acres), accounting for approximately seventy to eighty percent of the entire county's area. As for the embankments and dikes in Jiangning, those inundated include 39 dikes such as Yaohua Dike in the first district, the Zhabei Dike and the Third Dike in the second district, 64 dikes such as Guangyang Dike in the fourth district, 27 dikes such as Changchun Dike in the fifth district, 50 dikes such as Wan'an Dike in the sixth district, 84 dikes such as Yifeng Dike in the seventh district, 131 dikes such as Xiaoyao Dike in the ninth district, and all of the Shazhou Dike in the tenth district. Furthermore, the dikes in the first, ninth, and tenth districts are all located along the Yangtze River, while the dikes in the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts are all located near the banks of the Qinhuai River. Due to the increasing tidal surge, the water could not be discharged, resulting in complete inundation.</p>
<p>Chongming's Request for Relief: A letter was recently received from the Chongming County Relief Branch, stating: (Above omitted) This county is surrounded by the sea. In late last month, strong winds, heavy rain, and high tides occurred simultaneously, causing significant damage to coastal dike projects. More than 90,000 mu (about 14,850 acres) of farmland have been affected, over 1,400 houses have collapsed, and around 100 residents have drowned. A total of over 7,000 people are affected. Those dying of starvation are awaiting relief anxiously. Those who survived the calamity are truly pitiful. It is the duty of this association, and we dare not neglect it. We are currently coordinating with the county's party and government agencies, as well as local legal institutions and schools, to actively raise donations and expedite emergency relief to provide temporary assistance. However, the damage is extensive, the disaster area is vast, and our resources are limited, making comprehensive relief difficult. Therefore, we earnestly appeal to your association to treat everyone equally and quickly extend a helping hand. The gratitude for saving lives will be deeply felt. The urgency of this telegram cannot be overstated. (Below omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e109">Summary of Relief Efforts in Henan by the Jisheng Association <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association, recognizing the extreme suffering caused by both banditry and floods in Nanyang and Tanghe counties, initially allocated funds to the Nanyang branch of the association, led by Chairman Yao Junzhongbang, for emergency relief. Subsequently, based on reports of extensive damage and insufficient funds, the association allocated an additional 5,000 yuan for urgent relief and entrusted it to Chairman Yao of the county branch for distribution. Recently, the association received a report from the chairman of the branch stating that they plan to distribute the funds in Tanghe first, followed by Nanyang. Considering the possibility that autumn crops may not be replanted after the floods in both counties, the association has instructed the branch chairman to conduct a thorough investigation and decide whether to allocate funds for seeds and plan the distribution of winter relief based on the replanting situation. Furthermore, due to the severe disaster in Shenqiu County in eastern Henan, which has suffered from years of banditry and several lost cities, causing the people to be impoverished and displaced, the association is currently facing financial difficulties and can only provide relief to this county. It will strictly and generously distribute aid to alleviate the people's suffering. Previously, the director of the association's relief efforts in Henan, Feng Yangshan, reported that the disaster in Shenqiu was severe, and the association agreed to provide relief to the county, which was deemed crucial. The association had previously raised some funds for emergency relief, but considering the need for seeds to enable replanting and the hope for a good autumn harvest to ensure food for the people this winter and next spring, the association added more funds. Yesterday, the association telegraphed and instructed Director Feng Yangshan to personally inspect the disaster and distribute emergency relief with relief workers, and to plan for seed procurement to prepare for replanting. The association recognizes that the disaster situation in Henan Province is no less severe than in other provinces, and the number of affected counties is among the highest. Before the floods, the province suffered various other calamities, and charitable organizations have not been able to fully address the disaster in Henan. The association hopes that fellow philanthropists will take a unique approach and rescue the suffering people of Henan Province, which is the heartfelt plea of all.</p>

<p>Jiang Fuchun's Conduct is Shameful</p>
<p>Gao Juchuan, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, lived in Changkang Lane, Fangbang Road. At 2:00 PM on August 5th of this year, Gao returned home and saw his wife, Mrs. Gao Chen, gambling at home with a group of young people. Jiang Fuchun was among them, wearing shorts with his buttons undone. Gao found his appearance repulsive and immediately beat Jiang and extorted 100 yuan from him. Later, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent an inspector to investigate the situation, and Gao was dismissed and transferred to the District Court. After preliminary investigation by Prosecutor Zhao, Gao Juchuan was prosecuted for obstructing freedom, extortion, and dereliction of duty. His wife, Jiang Fuchun, and the gamblers were also prosecuted for gambling. Judge Deng opened the court session yesterday. Gao Juchuan testified, "I returned home and saw my wife on the toilet, while Jiang Fuchun was standing naked in front of the bed. I asked what was going on, and they said they were playing mahjong. I said, 'How can two people play?' Jiang Fuchun's face changed, and I wouldn't let him leave. Later, the people upstairs found out and said he was a neighbor. Then I called the police. The police said it was a trivial matter of little importance. Later, my colleagues came, and I also went out. Later, I reported the adultery to the court. At that time, Jiang Fuchun had written a note." The judge reviewed the note and said, "This note is written to indicate that they cannot gamble. It has nothing to do with adultery." Gao replied, "They can be used interchangeably. Otherwise, why would they write a note for gambling? Every day when I come home, someone says that turtle is back, so they are committing adultery. It is a fact." Wang Aweng testified that he lived at No. 4, Changkang Lane. Gao's wife ordered a maid to invite him to play mahjong. Gao returned and beat Jiang Fuchun, so he fled home. He didn't know what happened after that. Gao Chen testified, "Gao Juchuan is my husband. On August 5th, we didn't succeed in playing because we were short of one player. I was in the room, and Jiang Fuchun also came to my room to play." The judge asked, "What do you mean by 'play'?" She replied, "It was a momentary mistake. I have committed adultery with him three or four times. My husband did not handcuff Jiang, nor did he extort him." Jiang Fuchun testified that he was a traveling salesman for medicinal materials and had no adultery with the woman. He said that he was playing mahjong that day, and when Gao entered, he slapped him, causing his glasses to fall to the ground. As he picked up his glasses, Gao grabbed the handcuffs and handcuffed him, kicking and punching him. He even tried to draw his gun but was stopped. That's why he was extorted for 100 yuan. After questioning the witnesses from both sides, the trial was postponed to another date because the witnesses were not all present.</p>

<p>The apprentice who was burned to death was examined yesterday.</p>
<p>The Xingyuanchang Fried Goods and Candy Store, opened by Zhu Lushi at No. 16, Ximen Road, French Concession, caught fire on the 20th, burning apprentice Zhang Jiliang. The police sent detectives to bring Zhu Lushi, the owner of the store, into the police station for investigation. Yesterday morning, the police reported the situation to Prosecutor Ding Shikui of the Second Special Court, who, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Peng Xu, arrived to examine the body. The court was opened. The police informed the court of the situation. Zhang Gushi, the deceased's mother, stated that her husband had passed away and that this was her only son who had been tragically burned to death. She wished to collect the body herself. Zhu Lushi was brought into court by the detectives. He confessed that the fire started in the kitchen of the pavilion upstairs because the apprentice, the deceased, was cooking and did not clean up the embers. Mr. Ding verified the confession and ruled that Zhang Jiliang had died from being burned. The body was collected by Zhang Gushi. At 3:00 PM, the police transferred Zhu Lushi to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Ma Shounan heard the case. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the police station, explained the case, stating: "The defendant's store had fire insurance worth 4,500 taels of silver and was doing well in business. At 1:30 AM on the 20th, the fire was caused because the apprentice was cooking and did not clean up the embers completely. The police are prosecuting under Article 187, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. Please investigate." The defendant, Zhu Lushi, confessed that he was sleeping at 12:00 AM that night. When the fire started, someone knocked on the door and shouted that the kitchen upstairs was on fire because the embers from cooking had not been extinguished. He stated that the store had suffered losses of approximately 3,200 taels of silver. Judge Ma verified the confession and sentenced the defendant to a fine of 100 yuan for the fire, which could be commuted to one day of imprisonment for each yuan.</p>

<p>Two Naughty Children Involved in Over Ten Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>Sold to Other Provinces by the Kidnapping Ring Leader</p>
<p>Western and Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station previously arrested the kidnapping gang members Zhu Ating, Wu Zhaogan (both from Ningbo), and their fellow villager Fu Faqing. At 20 Jixiang Lane, Gaochang Temple, Huoche Road in the Chinese district, they further apprehended Fujianese woman Lin Wangshi and Cantonese woman Li Chenshi, and rescued an unnamed four-year-old Ningbo child. The case was handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation. The day before yesterday, the suspect Fu Faqing confessed that there was another woman, Lin Dingshi, who bought children and was hiding at 79 Bansongyuan Road in the Chinese district. Chinese Detective Liu Baoshan and Detective Xie Futang, together with Western detectives, secretly went to the location in cooperation with the Public Security Bureau. Just as they arrived near 79 Bansongyuan Road, they saw Si Gen, the four-year-old son of Zhou Ahe from Wuxi, who had been kidnapped from 96 Taopeng Road, playing nearby. His father immediately recognized him without mistake and took him home. The detectives then entered the house and arrested Lin Dingshi, rescuing a four-year-old boy from Henan named Niu Sheng. Lin Dingshi was temporarily detained by the Public Security Bureau. After finding the Henan boy's father, Wen Zhongqing, who lived at 308 Guoqing Road, Zhabei, they notified him to pick up his child. The Ningbo boy, Si Gen, was also taken home by his family. Yesterday morning, the police station brought the mischievous children Zhu Ating and others, along with the five men and women, to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the case and stated that Lin Dingshi, who was also arrested, was currently detained in the local court and requested that the court issue an official letter for her transfer. Following this, the victims Zhou Ahe and Wen Zhongqing successively described the circumstances of their children's disappearances. Then, Ji A'er from Tongzhou testified that his three-year-old son, Jinfa, disappeared from his doorstep on the 1st of this month at a certain address on Taihe Street, Yangshupu, and that Lin Wangshi had sold him to Fujian. Under questioning, the mischievous child Zhu Ating confessed that the three-year-old child Jinfa and the four-year-old child Si Gen were both lured and kidnapped by him and the defendant Fu Faqing. He claimed that the unnamed four-year-old boy in court was kidnapped by others. Fu Faqing admitted to the crime but claimed that two fugitives took them to Lin Wangshi's house to sell, remaining evasive about the rest. The mischievous child Wu Zhaoyan admitted to helping the kidnappers lure and lead away a total of eight children, all of whom were sold to Cantonese people and transferred to Xiamen. Lin Wangshi admitted to buying the three-year-old boy Jinfa, who had already been sent to Fujian. Li Chenshi stated that the unnamed boy in court was brought by an old woman in her fifties, who said that she had suffered from the Hankou flood and wanted to sell the child for 25 yuan. The police lawyer Qian further stated that no family had yet claimed the unnamed four-year-old Ningbo child. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody separately for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>The second floor of the Yichang Electrical Material Store at 196 East Hehuaide Road was rented to Zhu Yangshan. Recently, Zhu was in Wuxi on business, so his aunt-in-law Gu Cao Shi, 28 years old, and the maid Zhou Lü Shi, 38 years old, along with Gu's two-year-old daughter, were temporarily residing there. Unexpectedly, Gu Cao Shi and Zhou Lü Shi were simultaneously assassinated with sharp blades, resulting in their deaths. Later, the daughter frantically tapped on the glass window, which was noticed by Zhang Zhijun, a worker at the rice store across the street. He informed the nearby Chinese constables at 1415, who arrived and inspected the scene. They found the two women lying dead in bed, covered in blood, in a very gruesome state. They then notified the Huishan Police Station by phone, ordering detectives to investigate. The bodies of the two women were transported to the Féron Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Inspector Guo Wei from the First Special District Court arrived to examine the bodies and conduct an official inquiry. According to Zhu Yangshan's complaint, he was in Wuxi at the time of the incident, and the house was occupied by his aunt-in-law Gu Cao Shi, whose husband was in Hankou and with whom she did not have a good relationship. The maid Zhou Lü Shi had only been employed for five or six months. He suspected that the simultaneous murder of the two was the work of robbers, as the boxes in his house had all been pried open. Witness Zhang Zhijun also testified to the previous situation. Judge Guo then ordered that since the deceased Gu Cao Shi and Zhou Lü Shi were both killed by knife wounds while alive, Gu Cao Shi's body should be handed over to Zhu Yangshan for coffining and burial, and Zhou Lü Shi's body should be handed over to her brother Lü Rushan for coffining and burial. The police were ordered to strictly investigate the murderers and bring them to justice for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Miss So-and-So Asks (Regarding Negotiating the Dissolution of a Marriage Engagement) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>I am now twenty-six years old. My parents only arranged my engagement last year to a fifteen-year-old boy. At the time, because of the age difference of more than ten years, I proposed that I did not approve. However, my family is an old-fashioned family, so my parents used autocratic means to arrange the engagement. Now they are pressuring me to marry him. Because I feel that a small child cannot be a lifelong companion, I want to break the engagement, but I am bound by various family constraints and cannot fulfill my wishes. I request guidance and a reply in your newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) According to Article 975 of the current Civil Code, "A marriage engagement cannot be forcibly enforced." If you truly do not wish to marry because of the age difference, legally, no one should force you. Also, Article 972 states, "A marriage engagement should be made by the parties themselves." If you did not express your consent at the time, then it is of course possible to dissolve the engagement. However, you should sincerely and gently explain your difficulties to your parents, aiming to achieve your goal without hurting their feelings.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Mr. Li Asks (Please Promote Awareness of the Evils of Gambling) <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read a news item in your newspaper's local news section entitled "Féron Vautel Resolves to Ban Chinese and Foreign Gambling Dens," which gave me mixed feelings of joy and sorrow. Sorrow because of Féron Vautel's effort to eliminate harm for the people, and joy because everyone can live and work in peace and take the path of light from now on. Gambling is the most harmful thing, as everyone knows. At worst, it wastes time and causes unemployment; at worst, it leads to bankruptcy and even suicide, as newspapers often report. The psychology of gamblers is mostly based on the hope of getting lucky in order to make a large profit. How can they know that things will go against their wishes, resulting in empty-handedness, loss of morale, and returning empty-handed? I am an example of this. Speaking of it, I am self-reproaching and ashamed. Although I know there is more bad luck than good luck, I am eager to go. If there were no gambling dens, then everyone would live and work in peace and would never have such extravagant thoughts. In recent years, there have been no fewer than ten of the most prominent gambling dens in the French Concession of Shanghai. If they are not closed down soon, what unimaginable consequences will there be? I pity and hate myself, and I especially feel heartbroken when I see others suffering from the same disease. I appeal with no way to be heard, only sighing in vain. Your newspaper has the most credibility and consistently advocates justice and fairness in its special commentary. Could you please make written propaganda on the issue of "gambling" to remind my countless suffering compatriots? This kindness and virtue are a hundred times better than saving disaster victims. I implore the reporter to appreciate my foolish sincerity and publicize this in your newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your letter is very sincere. You have awakened early and stopped at the brink, which is worthy of respect. You are even more willing to share your experiences with the victims, which makes us even more moved. We respectfully reply to your letter in public to acknowledge your kind intentions. As for this newspaper's prohibition of gambling propaganda, it is the duty of the news media, and we will do our best.</p>

<p>Mr. Ye Xinan, the inventor of the Four-Corner Check Character Method, has now begun editing a dictionary. Mr. Ye believes that current dictionaries are not only inconvenient to check, but also that the annotations are mostly in classical Chinese, sometimes the wording is too high and impractical, sometimes the wording is unclear and incomprehensible, or even plagiarized from old dictionaries. Furthermore, they do not take into account the layout, font size, paper brightness, etc., which is not a fundamental way to improve the dictionary. Therefore, in addition to arranging the character positions, Mr. Ye has recently devoted himself to the study of annotation and printing. Soon, he will conduct experiments on the results of his research in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and invite educational experts to correct them.</p>

<h3 id="e155">The Development of Modern Chicken Farming <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Zhuang Ruiqing</p>
<p>In modern times, chicken farming has become a scientific undertaking, with astonishing advancements and inventions. This is because modern chicken farming is no longer a small-scale side business, but has become a large organization with deliberate planning. There are specific rules and regulations in the management and raising of chickens. Even the equipment in the chicken coops has been greatly renovated, with novel productions and creations. As for the prevention and treatment of chicken diseases, incubation procedures, breeding, mating, and registration, there is even more advanced knowledge and research. Therefore, this kind of scientific chicken farming is truly "hearing what predecessors have never heard."</p>
<p>We must realize that there is an important reason for the development of chicken farming: the method of breeding chickens used to be natural incubation (hen incubation), but now it has advanced to the ingenious artificial incubation method (i.e., machine incubation). We can regard this invention as the driving force for the development of the chicken farming industry, and also as the scientific revolution of the chicken farming industry, which has fundamentally improved and invented all the backward chicken farming methods of the past.</p>
<p>The invention of artificial incubation dates back to 1540 AD, when the Frenchman FrancigI first created an automatic incubator. Later, it was gradually improved, leading to the invention of the current hot water and hot air incubators. The image above shows the latest coal-fired incubator (Jamesway) from Jamesway in the United States, which can incubate two to three thousand eggs at a time. The highest number of eggs that can be incubated by an incubator is reported to be more than 600,000 eggs at a time by the coal-fired hot water incubator made by BuckeyeCo in the United States. The automatic incubator made by Deyuan in Jiangwan, Shanghai, China, can also incubate three to four hundred and eighty eggs at a time. According to our experience, chicks hatched by machine are indeed no inferior to those hatched by natural incubation. Compared with the advantages of both methods, chicks hatched by artificial incubation, as long as they are properly raised, are often stronger than those hatched by natural incubation. Therefore, after the invention of artificial incubation, it not only promoted the development of the chicken farming industry, but also eliminated natural incubation, replacing it with failure (chicks hatched by artificial incubation are raised with artificial brooders).</p>
<p>Although we have a general understanding of the invention and progress of artificial incubation, we should still understand the benefits of chicken farming in order to awaken people's attention and hope that our compatriots will work together to develop the chicken farming industry, increase production, and reduce the pain of unemployment or desperation. Furthermore, if the chicken farming industry can be expanded to the point of "ruralization" in the future, the current danger of the collapse of the rural economy in China may be considerably remedied by the increase in chicken production. Therefore, we should not only regard chicken farming as a "productive undertaking of the times," but also call it a "savior of life panic" or a "relief for the poor and desperate."</p>
<p>If we want to understand the benefits of chicken farming, we must first know the division of chicken farming in the current business world. The current business lines of the chicken farming industry can be roughly divided into three types: (1) breeding chickens, (2) egg-laying chickens, and (3) meat chickens. The standard for managing breeding chickens is determined by the egg-laying record of the breeding chickens raised. For example, in the United States, the famous farms that raise Leghorn breeding chickens include Holywood and Honson. However, the price of each Holywood breeding chicken is usually around US$500 (approximately 2,000 Chinese dollars), while Honson's are only a few tens of US dollars (approximately 200 Chinese dollars). This is because the egg-laying record of Holywood chickens is higher than that of Honson (each Holywood chicken lays about 330 eggs per year, while Honson only lays 300). Therefore, the benefit of managing breeding chickens depends on whether they can improve the high-yield chicken breeds. In other words, if you have advanced knowledge and experience and can create a high-yield breeding chicken (or various standard chickens), then you can gain several times the profit due to social trust.</p>
<p>(2) Egg-laying chickens. Most people who manage this type of chicken farming raise Leghorn chickens, because Leghorn has become a world-famous egg-laying chicken, laying at least about 150 eggs per year. For example, Deyuan's chickens have reached an average of 200. Therefore, the profit from each chicken laying eggs per year in Deyuan is about two yuan (Deyuan's egg-laying chickens cost about 3.6 yuan for feed per chicken per year due to better feed, and each egg is worth 5 cents, which is about 10 yuan for 200 eggs. In addition to labor costs, there is a profit of 2 yuan).</p>
<p>(3) Meat chickens. People who raise meat chickens mostly raise large-breed chickens such as Brahma, Cochin, or Chinese large-breed chickens, because these chickens have strong bodies and tender muscles. People are happy to buy them for sale. The feed cost of Brahma chickens from small to fattening period (fattening terminology) is only about 1.4 yuan, and the meat weight is about 9 to 12 pounds, so the profit is obviously more than double.</p>
<p>Since we have understood the benefits of chicken farming, I sincerely hope that our compatriots across the country will work together to develop chicken farming and increase production to relieve the personal panic of life. Now, I would like to state my personal opinions on the development of the chicken farming industry for the reference of our countrymen.</p>
<p>I am now planning a considerable amount of capital to return to Sichuan to open a chicken farm in Chongqing, and the purpose is to improve the chicken breeds in Sichuan and promote the development of the chicken farming industry. I plan to improve the chicken breeds in two steps: (1) Chick egg exchange method, that is, after the chicken farm develops, hatch a number of chicks with a large incubator every year, and ask the villagers to bring five to ten Chinese chicken eggs to exchange for a Leghorn chick. If so, the villagers will definitely be happy to exchange, and the Leghorn species will naturally be able to spread quickly. (2) Scattered raising and profit collection method, that is, distribute a number of chicks to farmers every year, without charging for the chicks, but only ask them to return ten to fifteen chicken eggs per year for consumption and sale to return the cost.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to here is that I absolutely do not advocate "hybrid improvement" of the Leghorn species with Chinese chickens. Therefore, the eggs returned by the villagers, regardless of whether they are purebred eggs or not, cannot be used for hatching and promotion because their feeding and breeding are not completely legal. They can only be used as eggs for sale. The success of chicken improvement requires decades of our efforts and dedicated breeding to succeed. The Leghorn chicken has been improved for several generations and has become a standard egg-laying chicken. We should raise this "purebred" chicken as the unit chicken species for improving Chinese chicken breeds, and there is no need to follow the "hybrid improvement" thinking advocated by the general public. The above-mentioned opinions are my suggestions for promoting the improvement of chicken breeds. I hope that the government can help in the future, so that the Chinese chicken breeds can be easily improved in a unified manner in a few years.</p>

<p>London News: Professor Thomson of Natural History and Sociologist Gattes have co-authored the book "Life, Outline of General Biology". The book discusses the future trend of world population and food. It states that the total world population is currently 1,750 trillion, with an average annual increase rate of about 12 trillion. The demographer Malthus calculated the world population at 850 trillion during the French Revolution. Compared with the current number, the world population has doubled within a century. In addition, the world's arable land is estimated to be 13,000 trillion acres. Each person needs an average of at least two and a half acres to supply their food. According to the current production and consumption status, the population that can be supported is at most several thousand two hundred trillion, and it is estimated that the population of five thousand two hundred trillion will be reached in another century. If this continues, the world's population will face the danger of food shortage.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the economic panic in the world, a huge recession has occurred in Nanyang, the supply area of rubber and tin raw materials. At present, the international market price of rubber is still only 13 or 14 yuan per picul, and the market price of tin ore is still only 40 yuan per picul. The revival of the value of rubber and tin is still in a long night, and it is unknown when a glimmer of light can be realized. The method of seeking relief is the most urgent task at present. Therefore, I have written this article on the defeat of the rubber and tin market and the relief of unemployed overseas Chinese to discuss it again and again with those who are concerned about overseas Chinese affairs in Nanyang.</p>
<p>(1) Reasons for the Defeat of the Rubber and Tin Market</p>
<p>Before talking about the defeat of the rubber and tin market, we should first talk about the reasons for its defeat. The reason for the defeat of the rubber and tin market is due to overproduction.</p>
<p>For example, the total amount of rubber produced in various parts of British Malaya in September of last year and the total amount of imports and exports, the output of rubber plantations above 100 acres was 22.172 tons, the output of rubber plantations below 100 acres was 17.772 tons, totaling 39.944 tons, imported 6.67 from foreign countries</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>8 tons, imported 15.282 tons from the Malay States, exported 49.982 tons to foreign countries, and 15.28 tons to local areas. The table is now listed below.</p>
<p>Production and Imports and Exports of Rubber in Malaya in September</p>
<p>Location Production Tons Imports Exports</p>
<p>Malay States Rubber plantations above 100 acres Rubber plantations below 100 acres From foreign countries From Malay States To foreign countries Local</p>
<p>Malay Federation 13.198 10.078 516.384 6.028</p>
<p>Johor 3.984 3.116 1.200 6.213</p>
<p>Kedah 2.233 946 1.065 2.341</p>
<p>Perlis 7 5 9</p>
<p>Kelantan 363 304 1 79 501</p>
<p>Terengganu 127 190</p>
<p>Total 22,172 17.772 6.678 15.282 49.982 15.28</p>
<p>Other rubber producing areas such as the Dutch East Indies, etc., the statistics are not available to me, otherwise there will be amazing numbers. Therefore, Reuters telegraphed that "the stock of rubber in London and Liverpool in early October has increased by 841 tons, and the previous stock is enough to supply the world for seven months." Overproduction can be said to be very huge.</p>
<p>The supply of tin, such as Malaya, Bolivia, Dutch East Indies, Nigeria, etc., the produced tin ore, like rubber, is also trapped in the fate of oversupply. I will not describe it in detail here.</p>
<p>(2) The Impact of the Defeat of the Rubber and Tin Market</p>
<p>The defeat of the rubber and tin market directly caused the bankruptcy of overseas Chinese rubber and tin owners, exporters, and speculators, such as Qicheng Company in Singapore, Wanlixing Company in Penang, Zhicheng Company in Jiangsha, etc., hundreds of millions of capital of merchants went bankrupt one after another, which is its example. The defeat of the rubber and tin market indirectly caused Chinese workers to lose their jobs and have no place to live and support themselves. As reported by the Star News, the recession of rubber and tin has besieged Nanyang. Chinese workers who have nowhere to go went to the consulate to petition, saying that on November 4, about seven or eighty unemployed Chinese workers gathered in front of the consulate. Because they have been unemployed for a long time, they are afraid that waiting here for a long time will make them even more depressed. Therefore, they jointly met with the consul to request repatriation. They had gone to the Protectorate to request, but were not accepted. Then they elected two representatives to meet with the consul. It was heard that Chen Consul believed that it would be good to repatriate these unemployed overseas Chinese. Later, Chen Consul told the representatives that he had visited the President of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and various Chinese shipping companies to discuss a proper solution. They all said that it is now the time of falling rubber and tin prices, and the repatriation of unemployed overseas Chinese is more difficult. However, being stranded in a foreign land is a tragedy, and those with a little conscience cannot bear to sit idly by. Moreover, this matter is also related to the national system. The local government originally had a move to repatriate unemployed Chinese workers, but those who were sent were the old, weak, disabled, and sick. Now, many strong overseas Chinese have also embarked on the path of unemployment, which is very pitiful. As for the method of finding repatriation, it is not easy to raise a proper solution suddenly. Moreover, this matter cannot be handled without sufficient financial resources. Therefore, it is now planned that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will convene a meeting of fellow Chinese to raise a proper solution. You should also understand that there are countless unemployed Chinese workers now. If everyone wants to be repatriated, it is also a difficult task. It is hoped that they will not lightly say that they will return home unless it is absolutely necessary. Repatriating unemployed overseas Chinese is our responsibility. Repatriation by the local government is a last resort. It is better if our fellow Chinese can send them back themselves. Moreover, the repatriation fee for each person is no more than ten yuan. If the fellow Chinese can work together to deal with this matter, it is not absolutely impossible. However, this matter should also be discussed with the local government, which is more appropriate. Because the repatriation has always been handled by the government, there are already more than 100 unemployed people gathering in the long gallery of the Chinese Affairs Department every night. The hardship of life can be imagined. The Protectorate repatriates old and weak overseas Chinese and unemployed overseas workers every week, and the number often reaches hundreds or even one or two hundred people. However, most of those who are accommodated and repatriated by the Protectorate are old and weak people, or illegal hooligans with disruptive nature. Those who still have the ability to work here are not easily accommodated. Dozens of people who jointly petitioned the consulate did stay in the long pavilion of the Protectorate every night, waiting for the boat to disembark, and because they did not catch up with the Dali Hua ship, these people left the Protectorate and agreed to turn to the consulate for help. Therefore, when they went to the consulate that day, some of them carried rattan boxes or packages and other luggage.</p>
<p>Also, the Penang News reported that the wave of unemployment has poured into Penang, saying that in Penang, the number of unemployed people has been increasing day by day. The local government is urgently thinking of ways to solve the problem in order to appease the people. The Chinese Affairs Department specially convened local people to discuss the issue of unemployment. Those who attended were very enthusiastic. Mr. Mi Dubu proposed that there is no other way to provide relief than to raise funds for relief. He advocated that fundraising should be carried out immediately. He said that Chinese enthusiast Qiu Shanyou has enthusiastically pledged to donate the food expenses of the unemployed shelter for one month, which has already been initiated by someone. It seems that this will be very easy to carry out. After discussion, it was resolved to hold an unemployment registration immediately. All unemployed people can go to the Chinese Assembly Hall to report their current situation in order to investigate how many unemployed people there are, so that it is easy to start relief. When the meeting was held, a group of unemployed people gathered outside the door and elected representatives to enter the meeting place to inquire about the current relief and how to start it. The chairman replied that it could only be decided after discussion. They then dispersed and continued the meeting. Mr. Lin Chengluo proposed that the government should reduce property taxes. He wrote to the Chinese Affairs Department proposing to hold an unemployment registration immediately, and that the current employees should donate one day's salary or wages to help unemployed employees. The Municipal Council should also cooperate as much as possible, as should the landlords, so that all land rents can be reduced. In addition, an agricultural policy should be implemented to allow unemployed workers to engage in agriculture (to be continued).</p>
