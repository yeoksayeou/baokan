<p>（北平）　哈電、日方因我屯墾軍集中砲兵於景星鎭、札來鎭等處、深恐嫩江橋以南日軍、側背受敵、故對黑軍、暫以騎兵紛擾小河子喇嘛店子等處、不向昻昻溪正面進發、十二日後、日軍騎砲聯輕進猛攻、均被我騎兵第一旅擊退、故目前佯以磋商條件爲名、實施緩兵之計、一俟宏前第八師團開到增援、然後作全線總攻擊、預料日内必有激戰、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（瀋陽）　今日此間接哈爾濱來電稱、大興與昻昻溪間之戰事、正在進行中、聞華軍激鬥數小時、死傷不少、日軍死傷之數不詳、本莊司令部亦宣布此項消息、謂黑軍五千名已與日軍在大興東面接觸、馬占山現在齊齊哈爾召開軍事會議、（十五日國民電）</p>

<p>（北平）　溥儀偕土肥原及遜清遺老遺少、由南滿路特備花車、送其抵瀋、溥儀寓舊皇宫、金梁等籌備復辟工作甚忙、溥儀定十五晨十時登極、僞國號仍用大清、惟年號爲明光、沿用軍機大臣及六部制度、不採内閣制、内定爲軍機大臣者、有溥偉·鄭孝胥·袁金鎧·金梁·等諸人、本莊令金梁修理故宫、儘日内完竣、前東北電政管理處即在故宫對門、已指定爲軍機處、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　日本要人正在瀋陽密議、於明光帝國實現後、將由日本首先承認其爲獨立國家、并向國聯理事會要求、許其加入國聯爲會員、此事國聯當難承認、但因此可使東北問題益增複雜、日本與明光帝國、國聯與中國、我國與東北將形成多角之微妙關係、日人毒計固堪痛恨、而無恥華人、甘爲傀儡、罪不容誅、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　據華人半官消息、溥儀已於今晨在瀋陽登殿宣布爲滿帝、以溥偉爲相、聞將以大清朝恢復照會各國、日本將向聲明撤兵、而由溥儀挽留、以維持秩序與保護帝位、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　德國日報對於溥儀圖謀復辟之風傳加以評論云、此舉是否有相當人數爲之贊助、抑僅屬徼倖行爲、最近之將來即可證明之、要之溥儀所爲、實成一種新頴而又危險之要素、或致影響中俄兩國之邦交云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（東京）　今日據官方電訊稱、溥儀已抵牛莊、但未徵實報載溥儀已抵瀋陽與袁金鎧同寓之訊、有以如溥儀宣布爲帝、日本將取何種政策詢諸日當局者、據答、該問題尙未經嚴重考慮、蓋滿洲各獨立政府領袖雖贊成復辟、但登位之舉、一時尙不致實現也、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<h3>本莊蔑棄信義聲明欲進龍江</h3>
<p>馬占山又接本莊繁通告改正十二日所提要求書</p>
<p>謂日軍應向龍江站出進我方覆稱此項要求無理</p>
<p>（北平）　齊齊哈爾電、馬占山十三午後、又接到林秀義轉來、昨本莊繁提出要求書中改正錯誤之件、通告如左、昭和六年十一月十二日關東軍司令官本莊、對於馬主席提出之要求書中、左記之件、因電文不明、文更誤記、應行改正爲、查十二日夜接收貴答覆文中、因有不符、望於十四日午前予以答覆、左記之日本軍之一部、爲洮昻綫安全保護起見、向洮昻綫昻昻溪站出進、兹致改正之文、即日本軍之一部爲洮昻線安全起見、應向龍江站出進、特此通告、此致黑龍江主席馬占山等語、查日人此舉着着進逼、毫無信義、請即宣布國聯、以憑公斷、我方答覆如下、逕啓者接閱二次來書、以昻昻溪站誤爲龍江一節、查龍江站原爲齊克線之站、至若洮昻線之終點頭站即係昻昻溪站、今貴軍一部即爲洮昻線安全保證、而謂出進於龍江站、想貴司令官當有所誤解耳、專覆奉答查照、此致關東軍司令官本莊閣下等語、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　自稱本莊代表之林少佐、十四日又到馬占山處、據稱、十二午傳達馬之哀的美敦書之說明、日軍將進佔洮昻路昻昻溪車站、現本莊又有通牒、中載昻昻溪爲齊齊哈爾、並限馬於十四上午十二時答覆、馬答稱、日本進佔洮昻路、仍係借口該路爲日本借欵所築在該路以昻昻溪車站爲終點、不知本莊據何理由、欲將日軍進佔齊齊哈爾、且貴代表數日以來、前後言語不合、語無倫次、形同兒戲、實無接受必要、林去後、馬即據情電告副張、並請轉禀中央、提出國聯、使暴日詭謀馬占山將軍全身小影</p>
<p>舉世共聞、（十四日電）</p>
<p>（北平）　林少佐今晨又見馬占山、謂本莊要求馬未照辦、日軍將切斷中東路西線、以截黑軍歸路、然後直取卜奎、馬答、守土有責、自當嚴重守衛、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）　陸軍省因恐嫩江日軍撤退後、華軍將毁江上新修之橋、故已命本莊留兵防守橋端、據官方宣稱、本莊已奉命向馬占山提出新哀的美敦書、今日外務省宣稱、外相幣原因須與瀋陽林總領事會商東省時局、召令回國、林已於昨夜由瀋陽啓程、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日東京接到關於馬占山作戰事之電訊、前後抵觸、據通訊社哈爾濱消息稱、領事代表清水·軍事代表林少佐·往勸馬占山將軍撤退齊齊哈爾與昻昻溪周圍之軍隊、已於今晨偕其他日人四名由齊齊哈爾抵哈、據稱、談判無效、日日新聞載較早之電報稱、已商妥一部分、馬允休戰、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（瀋陽）　齊齊哈爾日領事署之軍事代表林少佐、今晨以日本撤退嫩江境軍隊之條件送交馬占山將軍、其中有齊齊哈爾與昻昻溪周圍之馬軍應加撤退、馬軍不得駐在中東鐡路南面、及此項條件應於十一月二十五日實行各節、日軍事當局現殷待馬之覆文、大約明日可到、蓋南滿路線一帶邇來匪氛甚熾、日當局希望能將遠駐嫩江之軍隊調回助防、加以天氣日寒、兵士不能忍受也、惟聞本莊仍堅主日兵應長戍該地、以維持洮昻鐡路之交通、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聯今日開會</h3>
<p>道威斯僅在幕後一顯身手</p>
<p>駐法俄大使與白里安晤談</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國聯行政會明日下午四時（上海標準時刻約下午十二時）在此開會、巴黎空氣顯未有温和精神、日本準備重要讓步及折中辦法、現已在手之謠言、爲日内瓦所輕信者、巴黎人士不信其然也、日人方面毫未表示稍變其地位之趨向、路透訪員今日訪問日本主要代表之一、得悉日本不欲放棄其五項基本要點、必先在此五點上獲有滿意、然後始可思及撤兵至鐡路區域也、駐英美大使道威斯已發表一文、謂此次美政府或渠自己、未有渠須出席行政會會議之預料云、此說已引起對國聯表同情者之失望、蓋同情於馬占山將軍全身小影</p>
<p>國聯者、固深望道威斯在最後時期將出現於會場也、今不獨不見道威斯出塲、且欲見吉爾白立於幕後、恐亦不可得矣、此事雖未被人公認爲日本之大勝利、然日本觀察點之佔優勢、確無可疑、道威斯勢力之重量、固將在幕後覺之、但會塲中旁觀者將不見美人之折衝、蘇俄駐法大使道夫迦勒夫斯基昨日往見白里安、說者謂俄使此次訪問、殆向白里安陳說蘇俄在滿利益不遜於美國、而白里安殆已以未有美代表列席告之、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　此間俄人方面否認俄大使與法外長晤談時曾言及滿洲問題之說、謂蘇俄完全不與聞中日交涉、總之、蘇俄不願與國聯合作任何之干涉、俄大使與法外長所談者、大都爲俄法間商業上關係等事云、法官場不願批評外傳關於俄法談話之消息、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>從十月二十四日至今日</h3>
<p>舉世矚目之十一月十六。今已毫不遲疑的臨到吾人之眼前。國聯限定日軍於十一月十六日以前撤退之决議。今已正式宣告其毫無效力。世界各國關心國際和平之人士。在此嚴重事實之下。所感受者爲失望後之悲哀乎。抑爲目擊和平日瀕於絕境之焦思與苦慮乎。</p>
<p>自十月二十四日國聯正式决議勸告日軍於今日以前撤退以來。日人暴行。非獨無絲毫之輕减。抑且繼續擴大。使情勢更趨險惡。自十月二十四日以來。日人昭示世界之暴行。爲以所謂友誼之覺書。迫我黑龍江省馬代主席下野。並讓出齊齊哈爾。爲對我黑省暴力襲擊。戰事今且日益擴大。爲煽起天津事變。使我全國各地都陷於恐怖不安。爲刦持溥儀赴藩。組織極其滑稽之所謂明光帝國。此種事實。實足以證明日人已具揭開第二次世界大戰之序幕之决心。另一方面則已澈底暴露國聯之軟弱與無能。</p>
<p>國聯今擬尙未甘於即時終結其壽命。兹且將三次集會。作第三次之努力。然而强弩之末。勢已衰微。而列强之立塲。則又非眞基於公道與正義。旣如昨評所分析。是則三次集會之將依然無以解决此惟一難局。吾人稍加思考。當即可預爲判斷。</p>
<p>國聯三次集會。已移巴黎舉行。會場上並懸有極大之我東北地圖。使各國代表。都可一目瞭然於東北之形勢。其意一若曰各國其熟視此一臠肥肉。其仔細認清此一臠肥肉者。同時更證之以近日組織國際警察。及組織國際軍隊。維持東北秩序之說之高唱入雲。則國際之第三次集會。與其謂爲商討解决東北嚴重之局勢。商討維護世界和平之方法。寗謂爲列强正計議如何使中國陷於更悲慘之地位。以各遂其所欲。</p>
<p>美國迄至今日。從未有嚴正有力之發言。現道威斯雖已奉命赴巴黎。但已表示本人無列席理事會之必要矣。并且欲求如前次見吉爾白於幕後亦將不可得矣。其輿論界已突變態度公然作袒日之論矣。吾人懷疑於美國之態度已久。今已漸露其眞面目矣。美旣如此表示。則國聯當然無解决東北事件之能力。美之意欲澈底暴露國聯之無能。迄其最後。或將以其金元勢力爲中心。徐徐出而調停。以益顯示其躍居世界覇王之地位。然而就令將來美國果眞出而調停。其絲毫無利於我國。蓋又爲極明顯之事實。</p>
<p>故在今日之前。吾對於世界和平。尙有一線之希冀。今日以後。和平已眞瀕於悲境。全世界人類已全被籠罩於一種恐怖與迫害之愁雲惨霧之中。</p>
<p>設國聯第三集議而果不出吾人所預揣。仍無絲無結果者。我政府其將如何。接收遼吉失地之委員會已組織矣。然而自遼吉方面展開推進之日軍暴行。正方興未艾。黑省方面。馬占山將軍且正陷於孤軍苦鬥之中。東北方面之形勢如此。而國際之形勢則又如彼。今日以後。我政府究應如何。將仍乞援於國聯與非戰公約。呼靈於不可捉摸之公理與正義耶。抑將作最後之準備。發憤以圖自救耶。國人之目光。今已共集於政府。深望我政府急起籌謀。全體國民。當不惜任何犧牲。以作政府後盾。</p>

<h3>津市危機未去</h3>
<p>劃定緩衝地帶說不能實現</p>
<p>中日會搜便衣隊亦生波折</p>
<p>天津通信、十一日夜間、日租界便衣隊又向華界擾亂失敗後、十二日形勢稍趨緩和、一般人推測、以爲再過一兩日即可平安無事矣、不知事實上乃係明鬆暗緊、昨今兩日、日軍動作仍極緊張、界内各處堆砌之沙囊、且已逐漸改建持久之戰堡、英法兩租界、亦將電網接通、實行聯防、美國在津無租界、昨晨亦派遣美兵一隊、在特别一區防守、保護僑商、昨日下午、又在大營門靠海河一帶、挖築戰壕、凡此等等之布置决、非一兩日内可望平安無事也、據調查所得、十一日上午十時、中西紳商代表在銀行公會開會、擬建議將中日交界之三百米達内、劃爲緩衝地帶、由英美法義派兵駐守、使便衣隊與日租界隔絕、失其憑藉、俾便早日解决、我方表示、此舉祇要各友邦贊成、中國省市當局無不贊成、該代表等旋又訪德領事、德領事請用書面通知、俾有根據、各代表遂正式函達德領事、（因德領事係天津領團首席領事）申述此意、並請聯合各領事一致進行、以求實現、德領事當即邀集英美法義比等領事、討論辦法、均主張根據來函、致電北平公使團、請示辦法、日領事聞此消息、感覺不安、以爲如果劃定緩衝地帶、由英美駐兵、殊予日本顔面難堪、遂向市當局接洽、願組織中日檢查團、檢查中日兩界内、有無便衣隊藏匿、市當局對此舉、亦表示同意、乃日本一方面運用外交手腕、使緩衝地之計劃不能成立、昨日英美等國領事態度、忽趨冷淡、德領事且表示、「中日兩國的問題、最好由中日兩國解决、如果事實上需要各國派兵組織緩衝區、最好請中國當局來請求、比較鄭重而有效、」言外之意、似不贊成代表之建議、一方中日派員組織檢查團、原約昨日實行乃日領事臨時忽又變卦、謂「祗能會同檢查日租界外三百米達内之中國地、而不能檢查日租界内、本領事深信日租界内絕無便衣隊、故無需檢查、」因此中日會同組織檢查便衣隊之舉、遂又生波折、在日方反覆無常、不顧信義、已屬常事、然而由此一點、已可測知前途荆棘、肅清便衣隊實非容易矣、</p>
<p>昨日下午三時、日領事又赴特一區訪張市長、日領事面允今夜（十二日夜）日兵不放槍、果然由下午六時至十時、平安無事、不料十一時後槍聲又起、每分鐘約一二聲、至十二時又寂然、今晨一時半槍聲再起、時密時稀、二時半有砲聲二響、機關槍聲數次、均發自海光寺方面、至三時始寂、四時槍聲復作、四時半益烈、天明始已、然較八九十十一等夜、則已緩和矣、</p>
<p>昨日下午三時、社會局長吳甌在銀行公會召集各界開會、討論救濟市民問題、到五十餘人、對於不能出外工作之貧民、暫無辦法、第一步先救婦孺出險、當即决定（一）請紅十字會紅卍字會、用汽車迎接婦孺出險、有親友可投者、送至親友處、無親友可投者、送至新車站外舊道署收容、由戒嚴司令部發給通行證、（二）救濟用欵、由到會代表負責勸募、在欵未募集以前、暫向水災急賑會存欵項下借用、將來由救濟會歸還、（三）公推陳寳泉嚴智怡謁王主席、鄧慶瀾劉孟揚謁張市長、要求迅與各領事接洽、劃定中日間緩衝地帶、（四）延長市民購買食物時間、自上午九時至下午二時、（五）派警察保護自來水廠及電燈廠、目下華界各商號、依然閉門休業、食料燃料等、無不突漲數倍、且來源缺乏、極感困難、東馬路·營業大街·兩郵局、亦均不能辦公、至英法義租界、及特别一二三區之食料燃料、亦因來源匱乏、價值飛漲、牛羊猪肉、殆無購處、日租界居民、前日（十一日）日警署曾於短時間内開放須磨街、縱之逃生、不料又以人多擁擠、被法工部局阻回、現在已有十之七八絕糧、自來水日方曾於前日午將總水門關閉、昨午已開放總水門、界内電話、又於昨日不通、各界救濟聯合會對此尙未想出拯救辦法也、（十三日午）</p>
<h3>日軍强佔復縣煤礦</h3>
<p>北平通信、遼寗省復縣復州灣商辦之東北礦業公司煤礦、本月二日、由日本關東軍司令部派軍隊四十餘名、携帶機關槍砲、强迫佔據、將礦長王翼臣驅逐、其餘職員不許離礦、同時派滿鐡之岩根元三（Iwane　Motozo）爲礦長、並派日本顧問六名、監視各科、按該礦由遼寗商民集股及銀行投資組織而成、價值三百餘萬元、年出無烟煤二十五萬噸左右、行銷日本及中國長江一帶、十餘年來、純由國人辦理、苦心經營、未爲外資侵入、久爲日人所垂涎、今竟被日軍强攫而去矣、（十二日）</p>
<h3>日本財政上發露極大破綻</h3>
<p>募債與增稅</p>
<p>東京通信、日本此次决心以武力侵略我東北、其大批兵費之支出、將來於其財政上社會上發生如何影響、尙未可料、兹姑就目前之經濟狀况研究之、已足窺見其一斑、</p>
<p>一·這幾年世界不大景氣的波瀾、洶湧澎湃、德國財界的動搖、英國金本位制的停止、先後繼起、最近日本在明年度（昭和七年度）預算編成中、也發見了財政上極大的破綻、據井上藏相給幣原外相等的報告中說、「感受了英國金本制停止的影響、明年度日本的歲入、大形减收………」誠然、英國財政的變動、很足以影響及於日本國際貸借上的缺陷、但在這樣不景氣的年頭兒、日本内國工商業的凋敝、失業人數的迭增、對華貿易的惡調等等、亦已足牽連及於日本未來歲入的銳减了、這英國金本位制的廢止、不過是一種較强的刺激而已、最近日本大藏省着手編製明年度預算時、觀察本年度决算中歲入的不足、考慮未來情勢的衰劣、預算明年歲入的减收、當在一億三千萬元左右、</p>
<p>二、這一億三千萬圓的歲收不足、在過去歷年日本會計收入經常部額中、約占十五分之一（百分之六·六）、的確不能不說是一個可驚的數目了、同時在明年度預算編成上、實在也已是遭遇了甚大的困難、大藏當局爲要打開這難局起見、極力設法財政整理、打算在旣定經費項下、節約一億圓來彌縫這赤字、藏相奔走艱辛、要求各方給予以若干的諒解、但前月三十一日與本月一日兩次黨出身閣僚懇談會的參集、各方却藉故不允驟减、而陸海兩省、態度尤屬强硬、牽絲攀藤似的相爭不下、結果在明年度旣定經費中、最多祇可望節約七千萬圓左右而已、藏相一億圓的節約好夢、因成泡影、</p>
<p>時勢所逼、收入不足的餘額六千萬圓、當局决定採用「募債」和「增稅」的兩個方法來補救、因爲採用「募債」方法的緣故、六千萬圓的不足額上、還須加上一個五百萬圓的公債利息金、此外再合計明年新規要求所要財源的五百萬圓時、不足財源總額、當達七千萬圓、</p>
<p>三、這不足財源的七千萬圓、大藏當局已决定發三千萬圓公債、增四千萬圓稅收以補塡、關於公債的發行、大藏省大約用「事業公債」的名目募集、規定發行額爲四千萬圓、而預期純財源額可足三千萬圓、</p>
<p>至於四千萬圓的增稅呢、大藏當局决定採取資本重課的方針、雖說具體案還不曾正式决定、但大致不外是、（一）造酒稅之增高、（二）相續稅免稅點之減低及稅率之增高、（三）資本利子稅稅率之增高、（四）個人所得稅免稅點減低、更不足時、採用一·烟草加價、二·明信片加價、三·郵票加價等之方法以補塡、按是項課稅政策、有害於富者、而無利於貧者、結果必至貧富兩亡、</p>
<p>四、募債和增稅、在日本明年度預算案編成中、已成爲一重大的問題了、民政黨組閣以來、向以「非募債主義」和「減輕人民負担」等相標榜、但這次矛盾政策的取决、似乎已暴露了牠自身内部的不健全、吾人縱然承認第二次、（本月一日）閣僚懇談會中所說的「非常時須用非常手段」一語爲適當解釋、但這益足以顯示民政黨政治的失敗、民政黨實行緊縮政策、先後已二三年、但結果仍然祗贏得赤字一個、所以在今日遭遇「非常時」的責任、還須由民政黨負起、而斷不能以「非常手段」來掩飾了事、總之、這次「募債」和「增稅」手段的採用、民政黨已自動的打碎了半邊金字招牌、而給與野黨以可乘之機、（十月五日）</p>
<h3>駐汕日領又提無理抗議</h3>

<h3>義勇軍的訓練怎樣才能推廣怎樣才能持久</h3>
<p>— 清源氏</p>
<p>訓練的方法、從各工會、各機關、各學校等做起、（一）對他們說、一個人身體不强壯、雖有高深的學問和道德、是没有用的、從前羅馬、是一個最文明的古國、卒爲好勇鬥狠的日耳曼部落滅掉、弱國的文明、决不能敵强國的武略、這是千古不易的道理、中國雖是四千多年的文明古國、假使再不從事軍事訓練、結果、就是羅馬第二、所以軍事訓練、是救國的不二法門、（二）對他們說、西人俾士麥說、「公法不可恃、所恃者惟赤血與黑鐡耳、」誠然、中國到了山窮水盡、國難臨頭的時候、政府還是不抵抗、鎭靜、以待國聯解决、這等行爲、全是夢囈不醒、長此以往、國亡無日矣、俗話、「求人不如求己、」現在所能夠救國者、没有别樣、就是我們的愛國熱血、和黑鐡而已、要用這熱血和黑鐡、就是從事軍事訓練、（三）對他們說、中國的軍隊、雖有幾百萬人、駕乎各國之上、其實都是烏合之衆、徒耗中國的金錢而已你想除去老弱者十分之一二、從中取利、無愛國心者、又十分之一二、又除去有烟癖及有嗜好者十之半數、還有多少呢、這樣的軍隊、要抵抗列强侵略、不啻緣木求魚了、所以中國軍隊雖多、是靠不住的、所可恃的、還是我們自己從事訓練罷、這樣的到各縣各市各村裏去宣傳、就不難普及推廣了、持久的方法、（一）編義勇軍籍、令全國各省各縣各市鎭各鄕村、每年按户調查、兒童年齡十歲以上的、除一律進校讀書外、還須入義勇軍籍、重體操、漸參以兵操、中學的學生、體力已經强壯、就可實行兵操、中學或大學已經畢業的、或者農人工人年紀已及二十歲者、要當義勇兵三年、三年以後、退爲預備軍、再三年後、退爲後備軍、戰時就可立即召集、五十歲而止、（二）由政府令各省·縣·市·鄕·村·依法實行、規定每月有定期的會操、凡優良的、發給獎品、鼓勵他們、如是則尙武之道、風行全國、一朝有事、戰必勝、守必固、芒芒禹域、决不會被人蠶食鯨吞了、（三）經費、自募捐之外、政府非盡力補助不可、因爲義勇軍的性質、是暫時的募捐一層、有錢的、固不生問題、或者生活窘乏的、就難於應募了、假使多數人不允募捐、義勇軍就要失敗、這是一定的道理、要他永久下去、至少政府要補助經費的半數、以上三則、能夠實行、義勇軍的持久、就不成問題了、</p>

<h3>今晚西青籃球開幕</h3>
<p>七時起三塲比賽</p>
<p>今晚西青籃球會開幕、七時起共計三場比賽、秩序如下、</p>
<p>也是對麥令甲組七時</p>
<p>曁南對約輪甲組八時</p>
<p>沙格爾對翼隊乙組九時</p>
<h3>海軍中有强者東華遭其毒手</h3>
<p>三比四竟失敗甲組希望少矣</p>
<p>羣以爲東華昨日必勝英海軍、豈知結果大出意料、竟以四比三失敗、合計東華在甲組賽中、已敗二次、希望恐從此少矣、逸園中三千觀衆、大失所望而歸、裁判員李島、</p>
<h3>英海軍陣綫</h3>
<p>海夫門史密斯考克斯愛許門勞勃生亨格賴</p>
<p>魯賓孫克勞福克勞福勒許利弗特愛弗耶</p>
<p>東華隊陣綫</p>
<p>周賢言李寗　關洵安　陳璜　陳家球　歐陽永源　錢敬鏞　陳洪光　戴麟經　李義臣　陳虞添</p>
<p>海軍之佼佼者</p>
<p>東華之敗、並非偶然、昨日之海軍爲肯勃倫艦、非敗於樂華曁南之赫門艦矣、肯勃倫爲英艦之錦標隊、方於本月十日來滬、在香港曾以二比○擊敗南華足球隊、難怪東華爲其所敗也、</p>
<p>東華隊之减色</p>
<p>東華之减色、自爲失敗原因之一、聞李寗陳家球均感不適、屠開元之缺席、以陳家球移中、而歐陽永源殊形軟弱、中衛線之不振、影響前後二方、前鋒之聯絡、亦不若前次之滿意也、</p>
<p>中鋒先開紀録</p>
<p>東華開球、一下而前進攻門、氣燄甚盛、陳璞截得來球、輸送與陳虞添、虞添急進、再傳與戴中鋒、飛起攻門、適中門木彈回、將近十分鐘、海軍克勞福來、關截得與陳家球、再至戴麟徑、三傳與陳虞添、讓過史密斯、送球至戴、中鋒一舉中的、東華隊先聲奪人、</p>
<p>鐡門後方苦守</p>
<p>海軍經此一失、侵師來攻、勢甚汹汹、門前險象、不一而足、周賢言孤軍苦守、愛弗耶自右邊來、李寗阻之不得、一球至左、克勞福踢入、乃成一成一平手、海軍愈逼愈烈、球自各方俱至、一次勒許猛攻一脚、斜上右角、周賢言以爲進矣、不知彈於邊木、再彈横木而出、可謂幸矣、如此險象、層出不窮、</p>
<p>亂中攫得一球</p>
<p>海軍雖猛攻、周賢言嚴守不失、前鋒候機進取、戴麟徑得球、乃與陳洪光並駕而驅、將及門、陳洪光爲考克斯所阻、後衛與戴陳、圍住皮球、互相尋找、莫知所之、戴中鋒眼明手快、順勢撥出、蹴之入網、上半時東華以二比一居先、</p>
<p>勒許連攻連進</p>
<p>豈知禍患在下半時、接連而來、不五分鐘、勒許連破數關、一衝而進、過十數分鐘、勒許在離門二十碼地、又施急烈遠射、遂以三比二超出東華東華之形勢、益覺不振矣、</p>
<p>第三脚致命傷</p>
<p>失望中忽來喜訊、陳家球送球前方、陳虞添馳馬向衝、極左一脚錢敬鏞在角得之、勿回中間、考克斯等趕至、陳洪光已踢入造三比三和局、天禍東華依然危急、勒許疊破重關、第三脚制東華之死命、時離終局尙有五分鐘、</p>
<h3>英軍足球隊林肯及威德夏來滬期</h3>
<p>盛傳英軍將調防、足球隊亦將更動、據西人會書記海姆生君謂、林肯將於二星期後來滬、代替諾森堡、替史谷德之威德夏、須於一月中方能到此云、</p>

<h3>青島男女籃球賽</h3>
<p>祥泰隊以一四二比二大全勝</p>
<p>上海籃球健將席均女士表演</p>
<p>確有驚人球藝博得會塲喝彩</p>
<p>青島通信、率領上海兩江女子籃球隊遠征日本北伐津埠之席均女士、赫赫威名、震動中外體育界、女士於昨十二日加入本市女子籃球賽、全埠仕女無不爭先前往、一覩女士之絕藝、故球場上頓形人山人海、擁濟不堪、而各界欽仰席女士之熱烈、可見一斑、兹將是日之男女兩場球賽、分誌於下、（一）男子部（祥泰對聯合）由裁判趙化程鳴笛開賽、雙方健兒奮勇爭先、各獻其能、結果爲一百四十二比二、祥泰隊大獲全勝、（二）女子部、（非非對文德）男子部戰事告終、女子隊繼續開始、席均女士加入非非隊、時觀衆已圍得水洩不通、塲上空氣異常緊張、裁判員谷源容、因時間已到、攻擊令下、非非隊長席均、文德隊長袁誠森、各率隊員開始角逐、一分甫過、文德後衛潘秀蘭技術犯規、由席女士主罰、姿式美妙、雙手輕輕推去、球由籃心而入、先聲奪入、名不虚傳、觀衆無不喝彩、席女士每球到手、無論傳遞投籃、咸頭頭是道、惜兩前鋒接濟不力、喪失良機頗多、然在混亂戰事之中、女士竟能匹馬單槍、投進三球、罰進三球、而每球投入、確有驚人之藝術、無怪倭奴見之膽戰也、但美中不足者、女士氣魄、已非昔比、且獨力難支、呼應不靈、其失敗亦意中事也、結果爲十七比十一、文德佔勝、</p>

<h3>海外銀市回漲</h3>
<p>印度及大陸均買</p>
<p>昨星期日、倫敦來電云、印度及大陸雙方均稍有買進、賣户束手、市况平靜、據大條銀雖見上增、而美銀價略見微長、故今日標金尙無大跌可見、如近期加長四三七五、爲二十一便士五六二五、遠期亦長四三七五、爲二十一便士三七五、又接紐約來電、美銀價微長一二五、計現貨爲三角五分半、私電加長二五、市面堅平、英對美加上三七五、爲三元七角七分一二五、美對英加上半分、計三元七角六分半、倫滬先令仍爲二先令、孟買現貨小去三安那、爲六十五羅比○八安那、市面恍惚不定、</p>

<p>上週公債成交現貨雖多有開出、惟均零星交易、合計僅五萬八千元、内除編遣鹽稅整六等約各計一萬、其他均祇數千元、期貨亦以環象沉悶、大户形勢較前益趨觀望、一般經營證劵買賣者、態度概頗冷淡、故市亦比前週爲清、每日市場人氣、恒甚閒散、查每日成交情况、除週一達一千五百萬、週二約八百四十萬、以後日見寥落、每日多僅六七百萬元、週五祇開出五百數十萬元、統計全週成交五千萬元、較前週减一千七百數十萬、内統鹽稅二○關較多、統稅分十一月期五百六十六萬五千元、十二月期三百二十六萬五千元、二○關十一月期五百九十一萬五千元、十二月期二百四十八萬五千元、鹽稅十一月期四百三十九萬五千元、十二月期三百四十九萬五千元、裁兵一九關次之、裁兵計十一月期二百六十五萬五千元、十二月期三百七十四萬元、一九關十一月期四百六十八萬元、十二月期一百四十三萬五千元、餘如二○捲十一月期三百零一萬五千元、十二月期一百四十九萬、一九善十一月期二百四十萬、十二月一百零一萬五千元、編遣計十一月期一百五十六萬五千元、十二月期七十一萬五千元、其他如整理六釐八十四萬五千元、九六公債八十一萬元、關稅三十六萬元、金融二萬五千元、至言一週間各債價之變動情形、則以東北形勢仍極嚴重、日人積極侵黑、津之暴動亦未平、而國聯方面迄無舉動、各國態度混沌、故國内情况雖似稍佳、惟一般鑒於外交形勢無稍轉機、羣慮戰事或終難免、對於債券投資益乏興趣、大户均觀望不動、即零户進出、亦殊稀少、市場以賣買兩方旣無大出入、各價遂始終陷於盤旋狀態、結果較前週如一九關二○關鹽稅等現貨均稍漲、期貨一九關亦稍堅、其他一致回跌、爲數約在一元左右、察債市之形勢、在上週内雖始終上落甚微、特觀本週恐不能似此平和、蓋國聯本週内重開、外交前途、其必另有變化、在在均與證券市有重大之影響、惟其趨勢究屬何如、無術測知之其變也、兹將上週内各債價高低漲落統計分列如下表、（單位元）</p>

<h3>紗花過去一週間紗市賣氣濃極</h3>
<p>實需在停頓中</p>
<p>紗市在週間、異常衰弱、毫無振作精神、以暴日侵略、日甚一日、黑省開戰、致人心惶惶、金融奇緊、實銷遂停頓、全無興奮之狀、因之賣氣頓熾、市盤由此瀉下、中途某巨商在近月如再跌、有收進之意、故情勢稍定、然四圍環境不良、且國事多難、商業受其重大打擊、何能有興旺氣象、所以大勢依然散漫不過本紗底貨未厚、五十二三兩恐有一度盤旋、標紗價各月比上週跌三四兩云、</p>
<h3>上週棉市不穏</h3>
<p>華廠又定外棉幾萬件</p>
<p>棉市一週以來、頗有不穏之狀、以美印兩棉、趨勢甚疲、而銀價放長、金價日短、以致外棉採算銀盤特廉、較本棉價過五六·七·兩此種情形、爲歷年所罕見、因此各廠紛紛購定外棉、查海關報告、每日竟有進口、於是本棉之需、完全被其侵奪矣、然有一棉商及寗波帮漢口帮、在此外棉大批進口之時、居然能有軋空之聲浪、且態度强昻、探其用意、以外棉雖廉、不能交解標準、而各路出貨未旺、因之拉緊本月不放、所以標棉差價與美棉比較、相差八九兩之巨、造成將來之新低峯、總之暫時以貨缺關係、尙能立定、照大勢論之、本棉前途情形、萬分的危險、恐怕有一度激烈變動發現也、標棉價比上週跌六七錢、美花比前週跌二十五磅音、各廠在此週中又定美印兩棉、數約幾萬件云、</p>
<h3>外棉一致傾跌</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因華爾街不振、賣户增加而疲、後因一部份補空略回、計期貨跌八至十一磅音、現貨跌十磅音、英棉期貨跌八九點、現貨跌四點、埃及棉現貨跌五點、印棉因歐洲出口商抛賣而疲、計平果爾及奥姆辣跌四·二五羅比、白羅溪跌二·七五羅比原電録左、（十四日電）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市跌落二角</h3>
<p>南頭昨日西路來源、約有四十餘艘、本街店胃因到貨見旺、交易更覺呆滯、厚新粳行情頂貨平定、次疲二角、窰種百哥到積雖有、銷場本街又復栗碌、市價亦呈平穏、洋杜尖沙船帮買去二百石價比昨甩落近角、洋米現銷不暢、期貨略有、市仍平庸、</p>
<p>新閘昨市愈覺平淡、買氣不振、早間開盤上落有限、西新頂貨略疲角許、早晚稻上棧異常寂寞、大盤又低一二角、白野稻存貨雖少、形勢反低、變陰二元酒户勒價、市形獨挺、洋杜尖客帮交易稍有、本城買進不多、市面平定、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白市面步落</h3>
<p>昨日糖市因值星期、産區無電、公會劃盤交易、仍見沉寂、人氣仍衰、市價又見步降、荷糖二十四號粗砂白初時喊價六兩九錢、毫無問津、後市高貨劃九兩八錢半、普通仍少受手、二十號中砂白九兩七錢二分半、略有成交、趨勢依然黯澹、太古糖交易較暢、但出户頗盛、市亦步落、Ｂ嘜價爲十一兩五錢至四錢半、ＤＹ嘜十一兩四錢、ＨＸ嘜十一兩三錢、ＨＭ嘜十一兩零九錢、後市亦見萎弱、縱觀糖市一時尙乏轉機希望、但市存不厚、附加稅勢將實行、各處去化或可活動、則回風之來、亦意中事耳、</p>
<h3>五金白鐡皮薄貨今日可出</h3>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>Z&gt;燕子</p>
<p>甲午是開戰後。吳大澂宋慶奉命出師。駐兵關外。其時日軍不敢公然對陣。專以暗探化裝。渾入清營中。探聽軍情。用種種詭計。以圖一逞。捕獲奸細。時有所聞。總營務處魏光燾老於軍事。機變百出。爲吳所倚重。每日捕得奸細。操純熟之中國話。幾莫辨其爲日人。魏密訊時。雖用酷刑。不得其端倪。幕中翁綬琪獻計云。日人從幼着木屐。騐其大足趾。即可了然。魏頗韙其言。騐之皂白頓分。百無一失。前鋒宋慶部。與日軍接觸。捕獲日俘。嚴搜其身。得中國地圖於軍帽内。攻守要地。瞭如指掌。再三嚴鞠。始供出日商之入中國賣藥者。均有軍事學識。到處偷繪地圖。以備軍事時代之需用。可見其用心之縝密。而早蓄異謀也。日人誠狡矣哉。</p>

<h3>佛蘭克林（三）</h3>
<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>佛蘭克林離開波士頓做了幾年生意之後便自己開了一個書店。他這店裏賣書是没有二價的。我聽得有這樣一段故事。一天一位客人來買書，問：</p>
<p>「這本書賣幾多錢？」</p>
<p>櫃臺上的徒弟說：</p>
<p>「兩槐錢！」</p>
<p>客人說：</p>
<p>「太貴了！一元八角吧。」</p>
<p>徒弟說：</p>
<p>「現在長價了，要賣兩塊二角咧。」</p>
<p>客人說：</p>
<p>「你纔說過兩塊錢，怎麽又要兩塊二角呢？」</p>
<p>徒弟說：</p>
<p>「現在要兩槐四角了。」</p>
<p>客人以爲徒弟故意敲竹槓，便與徒弟閙，佛蘭克林老板從裏面走出來，客人便向他質問爲什麽一忽兒就加了四角錢。</p>
<p>佛蘭克林笑嘻嘻的拿了那本書對他說：</p>
<p>「時間值錢呀！敝店做買賣是不還價的，先生要買這本書給兩塊錢好了」</p>
<h3>馮庸與楊雲史詩</h3>
<p>— 羽侯</p>
<p>馮庸日前來滬。向和會請願一致對外。昨又赴京作同樣之請願。有見之者。謂其英氣勃勃。而和藹可親。因憶江東楊雲史先生。昔年曾作詩贈馮。已許爲奇士。且詳載其歷史。因摘録之。以告欲知馮之歷史者。楊之原文云馮庸。前熱河都統馮麟閣子。少年負奇氣。英偉磊落。多大志。父殁。出其遺産鉅萬。創馮庸大學。以敎人材。其校以尊孔重道爲主義。以孝悌忠信禮義廉恥爲敎綱。輔以五尙五戒。志在挽拯陷溺。正人救國。其志不可及。其識尤不可及。衆醉獨醒。而力足以濟之。奇士也。今秋俄人大舉侵我邊地。馮方部序學生三百人。親赴極邊助戰。目覩英異。驚喜無已。孰謂我無人哉。因贈詩二章。以送長征。詩云如此男兒生不虚。萬間廣厦意躊蹰。將門多少佳公子。吾愛馮庸並世無。壯士高歌出塞天。丁年按劍靖三邊。嫖姚事業留餘氣。東北長城兩少年。（却酬）</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>南美洲委乃瑞拉Venezuela有一種樹。倘用刀子。戳穿了樹皮。會流出牛乳似的甜液來。曾由化學專家加以化騐。據說這樹液中所含的燐質與糖質。比牛乳更爲豐富。</p>
<p>英國大詩人米爾頓氏Milton的「蘭西達紛」“Lycidas”詩稿。曾經他本人親筆改削。一般藏書家推爲世界最名貴的書籍之一。</p>
<p>南美洲巴西國Brazil的森林中。大樹極多。不必用刀鋸去鋸斷。自會倒下。原來有許多甲蟲給它們先生樹幹上蛀成了一條槽。從此越蛀越深。終於倒塌。巴西每年總有許多名貴的樹。都被這種蟲蛀壞。</p>
<p>英國德萊恩河上白頓鎭Burton·en·Trent的河水。有特殊的功用。可製啤酒。數百年來。久已聞名。開始時還在耶穌降生後一千二百九十五年。釀酒的都是當地的僧侣。</p>
<h3>青島聊城路之侵略商店</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>暴日之視我國。猶之台灣朝鮮。故其侵略政策。雖一商店之微。無不含有侵略意味。其意在一方吸收我國之金錢。一方則釀成我國之内亂。在青島區。日人所設包含侵略政策之商店。已不可勝數。青島日人所居之地。名聊城路。有日兵駐防。以保護僑民爲辭。實則即恐我國官廳。嚴禁若輩活動。而改少其侵略我國之實力。故凡聊城路之日本居民。横行不法。國人無如之何也。此種侵略商店。大約分爲四種。即販賣毒品與軍械。妓院與待合所是也。兹分述於後。</p>
<p>暴日在我國。販賣毒品者。皆爲日浪人。凡鴉片海洛因嗎啡紅丸等。無一不全。亦無一非日本製造者。其量頗可驚人。每年銷運於我國者。約百萬日金以上。在聊城路中。有一絕大之組織。常開秘密會議。對於我國毒品之偷運。其法至善。且藉膠濟路爲護符。山東當局。雖常有所獲。終不能破獲其主運所在。而此輩販賣毒品之浪人。一旦有事。則皆爲軍人。所謂在鄕軍人是也。</p>
<p>軍械之販賣於我國。其用途則爲供給土匪及不肖之徒。使其擾亂我國之治安。及糜爛地方。以此東魯一隅。土匪盜賊。甲於全國。即日人所供給也。且日人之販與土匪者。乃其本國視爲不適用者。而在我國。尙屬精良之器械。</p>
<p>妓院與待合所。則誘惑我國之有志青年。使墮落其愛國意志。且見我國之愛國青年。必多方迷惑。務使其不能爲祖國效用而後已。若妓女一旦懷孕。則立即歸國。故從未有見日妓之懷孕者。蓋日本人口。較之我國。相去不可以道里計。此舉即所以增加祖國之人口。亦侵略之一種也。</p>
<p>凡此種種。初視之似甚微細。不知一旦有變。其在華之勢力。即不可侮。今遼東事件。即可見其端倪。凡我國之地勢風俗。無不了然。際此暴日野心暴露之時。安得以其細微而忽之哉。</p>
<h3>無尾飛機之發明</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>近世科學日昌。種種戰爭利器。先後發明。說者謂二次世界大戰。脫不幸而實現。則各國之戰鬥力。行將不在海軍陸軍。而在空軍之實力如何。以判勝敗。斯言誠是。蓋飛機一物。旣爲交通之利器。又屬戰爭之要具。以歐美各國。近來對於飛機之製造。精益求精。而各種新式之飛機。先後發明也。如最近德國方面。又有無尾飛機之發明。在柏林丹柏爾好夫飛機塲。已作一度之試機。速度最快時。每小時可達九十六哩。引擎之馬力爲二十八匹。其實力之厚。可見一斑。發明者爲亞力山大利比克氏Alexander　Lippich乃德國飛行科學界之有名人物。在彼之心目中。以爲無尾飛機之發明。乃飛行術上一大進步。且可證明航空之實力。有特殊之進展。並謂將來所用乘人之飛機。所用翼子。勢必放大。而今日所用之小翼。他日必爲淘汰。無尾飛機。經其努力研究。已告成功。然目前渠尙擬發明一種巨翼飛機。坐位放寬。專作乘人之用。據云此種飛機。非常經濟。最適合於商品之運輸。惟製造之初。第一步當先造全翼飛機。第二步方可依計劃製造。經過試騐成功而後。始可裝置引擎。開始航行。至於最近發明之無尾飛機。名「黑爾門」號Hermann　Kchel。因此人曾捐金促成橫渡大西洋之不斷飛行。故用其姓名。以作紀念。據最近試航。此小飛機高僅三呎。而可上昇至一四·○○○呎之天空中。成本僅美金一·七○○元。左翼與右翼之距離。共計四十二呎云。</p>
<h3>續我之企業談</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>或謂集資組織公司。談何容易。且凡欲以小資本謀事業者。往往爲自謀職務起見。假令投資於别人所組之公司。連帶要求求畀一職司。未必可能。而且公司是否可靠。苟無灼見眞知。亦屬茫然。萬一倒閉。則本利全無。是不如小本經營權操於己之爲得也。予謂此說良是。如果能以小本經營。自操必勝之權者。本不必依賴乎人。惟在自己並無一些經騐。一切設施計畫。全賴其僱傭之人。則危險甚大。譬如盲人而騎瞎馬。又復問道於盲。則必陷入深潭。危及生命。可斷言也。故栩以爲如上所述。以投資若干。附帶要求一職。實非所宜。例如投資一二千者。要求一職。則十萬資本之公司。至少須能容納股東自身或其所薦之人至五十人之多矣。是否能勝其任。姑且勿論。但此五十人之薪食。假定爲每人二十五元。即需一萬五千元之年俸。而預算開支充分不過二萬。僅餘五千。即就房租而論。容此五十人之宿舍及其茶水電燈之費。恐已岌岌乎難之矣。况股東及其所薦之人。最難熨貼使平。一國三公。尙且不可。而况羣龍無首。各存睥睨之見。又爲情勢中所必然。是其失敗可必。又安望其成功。惟有一法。頗屬可行。假定出資二千。認定一種容易推銷之某廠出品。即向該廠繳作押櫃證金。或竟買其股票。而以股本爲担保。即向該廠領取二千元之貨品。在其熟悉之地推銷。則不啻以二千資本。咄嗟之間。已成一廠。已出貨品。而且已經著有商譽。儘可不必自登廣告。而坐享其酬佣。假如進貨二千。放出一千。存棧一千。分銷店爲十家。每家每日但銷五元。即得月銷一千五百元矣。以五厘佣計。可得七十五元。而一方面有二千元之股本。附在公司中。尙可分得紅利。姑作押櫃論。長年一分。亦得二百元。加以所得佣金。歲入可一千一百元。即使雇傭一人爲助。年支三百元時。亦得八百元之歲入。是核四分利矣。此等辦法。凡栩所主各廠。皆可容納。並不爲奇。蓋於雙方皆無危險。比較任何方法爲穏健也。假如自設一廠。自造一物。及其成功。是否能銷於市。尙不可知。即使能銷。而對内對外。悉賴一身。勞苦且勿論。能力是否充足。實爲一大問題。如爲上述辦法。則對付方面。僅僅十家。均在眼前。所放帳面。一家不過百元。即便一年之中倒閉五家。亦尙可得三百元之餘利。即使所投資本。竟被上行倒却。然而一手付錢。一手取貨。付出二千資本。早已取到二千元之貨。亦正足以抵銷。不過利息無着而已。比之一張空紙。豈不穏健多多。而在廠方。則發出之貨。已先得到現錢。縱令一去不復返。亦不受皇帳之損失。故予以爲終南捷徑。惟此一條。舍此而外。欲使不學而能。操券獲利。則百思不得一當。恕不能爲萬全之謀也。故於近函多置未答。謹以此代答函。幸勿笑爲老生常談也。（移酬助賑）</p>
<p>（附白）十月十日企業談上第十一行若爲工廠誤若爲名。又第五行廣告云云假定爲（二十字短行二十行）漏誤爲二十短行。又其刋費查爲每行四角。栩誤憶爲四角半。合併更正。</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十八）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>他揉了一揉眼睛，近前看時，的確是兩家文魁齋。而且都是老店；都是起首創始；每家店堂裏，都坐了一位年青的夥計。鄕下人又覺得奇怪了。這兩個文魁齋，究竟是一家的呢？還是兩家的呢？而且是兩家開在貼隔壁。你也賣的那樣的糖食；我也賣的那樣的糖食；兩家文魁齋併合起來，不是很好的嗎？何必要分開做兩爿店呢？旣然同是文魁齋的招牌，大概是他們祖傳下來的這塊招牌，所以說是老店，所以說是起首創始，大家都是一個老祖崇，何必要互相對峙呢？</p>
<p>鄕下人蓄着一種調和的精神，先向靠東的一家文魁齋走過去。那個夥計，以爲他是來買東西的，站起來迎着他。</p>
<p>「請問：你們的兩家文魁齋，是一家呢？還是兩家呢？」</p>
<p>那個夥計，本想不去理他。轉念一想：他來問一家，或兩家，也許是買差了東西，要來掉換。也許是指定了我們兩家中的那一家，要買某種糖食的。因此向他含胡了一句：</p>
<p>「我們也算是一家，也算是兩家。」</p>
<p>「怎麽旣是一家，又算是兩家呢？」鄕下人追問了一句。</p>
<p>「本來是一姓，但是兩房，所以可說是一家，又可說是兩家。你問他怎的？」</p>
<p>這個夥計有些兒厭煩起來了。</p>
<p>「那末旣是一家，爲什麽不併合起來呢？」</p>
<p>「因爲從前涉過訟。」</p>
<p>「我勸你們旣然是一家，應該合併起來。何不開一個和平統一會議，通力合作，把兩個門面，併合一起，祗要大家讓步一點就是了。」</p>
<p>文魁齋的夥計：想這個鄕下老頭子，難道是一個瘋子嗎？他走上來，我還以爲是他要買什麽糖食咧，誰知他來干涉我們東家一家或兩家的事。這是他們幾十年的陳年古董的賬，店也開了不少的年份了。難道這個鄕下土老兒，是我們店主東的什麽老長輩嗎？不然，就是瘋子，我們不用去理他。</p>
<p>那個夥計，也就不去理他，招呼别一位主顧去了。</p>
<p>鄕下人想：做調人是兩方面都要周旋的。他是那方面不理他，便到這方面來了。</p>
<p>他回過身子來，向着靠西的一家。一個和隔鄰差不多年紀的夥計，正站在櫃台裏面。</p>

<h3>悲哀</h3>
<p>— 雯卿</p>
<p>一個擁有巨資的廣東商人、在東印度一個繁華的大城市、開設一家有規模的大旅社、他們接客的卡片和旅社的章程上、都印着優待流落海外窮迫同胞一條規例、並且、特地設備三等客房爲招待所、在七月中旬、我也做了他們三等客房的一個顧主、因爲要等着開往中國海船行駛的日期、只好决定在三等客房停留五天了、</p>
<p>天氣非常煩熱、正是赤道之下的暑天的煩熱、差不多簡直没有勇氣跑出去和這將要告别的城市作最後一次的辭行、只是整天安安靜靜地坐在房子裏、搖扇看着、或看左腕上的時表的鋩針、很迅速的一秒一秒地走過去、</p>
<p>在隔壁一間房子裏、每天早晨、傍晚、深夜、有溜出一陣提琴顫震的聲弦、在寂寞的空氣中蕩漾着……悲壯、幽怨、悽寂、清越、這種微妙的聲音、與庸俗城市人們的生活、相隔太遙遠了、似乎是在自奏自解、自悲自慰的調譜、</p>
<p>提琴的主人││他的房門、白天總是緊緊地鎖着、間或有很少的時候、房門是開着在、有時在他的門前經過、偶然調轉頭去、見一個不長不矮的人影站在窗櫺的一角、左手拿着淡黄的調色木板、右手握着一管畫筆聚精會神的把他自己的心血和生命一筆一筆塗在畫布上、有時也見他握着鋼筆、埋頭俯案、在白紙上沙沙的寫着、但誰也不知道他寫的是些什麽玩意兒、我雖然看見過這末一個人影在一間房子裏工作、奏提琴、高歌低吟、但我從來没有注意過他的面貌、</p>
<p>幾日來的天氣非常熱燥、疲倦的靈魂、也被熱魔纒得困乏了、黄昏去不久的時候、我滅了暗淡的燈光、解衣上床、</p>
<p>一縷夢魂、已迷迷惑惑地投入了睡鄕、後來、又被隔壁房子裏溜過來一陣吚吚嗚嗚的提琴聲弦驚醒了、我軟軟的睡在床上、靜靜地聽這種聲弦顫震、覺得比平日更加悽悲、好像是從自己的心墳中抽出絲絲縷縷流浪酸楚的情調、我聽得幾乎不忍再聽、也感到自己流浪生命的飄零、但我怎樣也不能重入夢境、於是、我溜下了床榻、扭開了電燈、開始寫一篇短短的散文││拾起我在異邦飄泊生命的浪痕、當我寫完了一張稿紙、隔壁的琴聲已停止了、靜靜寂寂地像一個莊嚴的死境、過了一會兒、又隠隠約約地聽見提琴的主人發出一縷微細的嘆息聲、接着又像神經病一樣的自言自語的說、「天涯的流浪者、歸去吧、唉、呌我又怎能歸去呵……」</p>
<p>眞奇怪、這個人發出的聲音、我好像聽得很熟悉的一樣、當時、我停了筆頭、沉默了一會、是的、不錯、這個人的聲音、我是聽見過的、彷彿是兩年以前、在西子湖濱、有一羣「波西米亞」似的流浪者、他們都在人生舞台的前面、扮演着話劇、記得在一駒「未完成的傑作」中、有一個扮演唱詩班的少年、和一個已處死刑第六號的囚犯、「先生、你爲什麽不用你不想象、完成這副偉大的畫呢」、「威斯濟、再來一盃」、他一個人的面貌、代表了人間的「善」與「惡」、他所發出的那有天堂地獄之别的聲音、印在我的腦子裏非常深刻、我幾乎確定隔壁提琴的主人、就是那位扮演唱詩班的少年和第六號的死囚、我想、假若是在遠隔天涯的異國、偶然遇着了一個相識的人、那倒是一件很有趣味的事哩、</p>
<p>第二天早上、我很想看看那位提琴的主人、究竟是不是在西子湖畔扮演「未完成的傑作」中那位代表「天堂的慈善」和「地獄的罪惡」的脚色、待我把房門打開一看、殊不知他早已從我的睡夢中溜出去了、</p>
<p>當夕陽西斜、金光灑滿了椰子梢頭的時際、我在走巷上徘徊了一會、又獨自倚欄納凉、遠遠地看見一個灰色西裝的青年、挾着一個報紙包裹、好像是包的書籍和稿紙的樣式、右手拿着一的嫩緑香蕉葉子的小包、一看就知道是士人吃的三仙錢一包的粗糙黄飯、他漸漸兒走近了、走到一層隔門之間、似乎躑躇着、好像口唇揚揚地要問我、而又不敢冒昧的神情、他那一副代表了「善」與「惡」的面孔、我一見就很熟識、所以我預先問了他一聲、</p>
<p>「吳先生、你怎麽樣會到這裏來的」、</p>
<p>呵、密司劉、你是什麽時候來、現在又要到什麽地方去、我們在這麽遠的地方、偶然相遇、眞是巧極了、」</p>
<p>「我來了一年有餘、現在要回國去、先生、你呢」、</p>
<p>「我麽、自從在西子湖濱演過劇之后、就伴着我的提琴│牠好像是我的靈魂一樣、跟着我天南地北的流浪、我在這寂寞與黑暗的國度裏、差不多快要流浪兩年了、在外面漂泊日子太久、使我思國懷土的情熱非常激烈、因爲我的行踪如浮草一樣的飄動、以前的朋友們也和我斷絕了消息、我比沙漠之中的騾駝還要寂寞呵、現在鄧先生和白先生在何處呢、」</p>
<p>「他們麽、現在也和風一般的不知道他們的行踪、」</p>
<p>「你回國之後、若是會着了鄧白兩位先生、請代爲轉達他們、說他們有一個無出息的窮朋友、在一個冷寂的國度裏、看夠了鷄蛋般的白眼、聽夠了毒惡的聲音、我本想回去的、可是……」</p>
<p>「先生、你怎末不找事情做呢、」</p>
<p>「找事情做麽、這根本是不容易的事呀、像這些目不識丁的瞎眼睛商人所辦的學校、專一收納那些搖尾乞憐的飯桶敎員、這種阿諛逢迎的事情、我餓死也是辦不到的呵、我也跑過不少的地方、到處都是碰釘子、差不多頭都碰破了、他們、如同中國的村婦老媪一樣的不了解我、說我是一個拉洋胡琴、繪糊塗洋蛋的下等流氓、這種流氓是被中國境内的高官大老所遺棄的人、他們幾乎肯定我的人格、簡直比不上那些敎大狗·小狗·的國語敎員萬分之一的價值、因此、我再也不夢想吃敎員的飯了、」</p>
<p>「先生在這邊有朋友嗎、」</p>
<p>「那些小學敎員、和瞎眼睛商人、一個人也看不起我、幸得有一位荷蘭的電影製作家、他倒很能諒解我、他說我所描繪的蛋、一筆一筆都深藏着人類不調和的色調、與二十世紀的青年的苦悶、這是充滿了生命力量的作品、並且、他說我所奏的提琴的聲弦、悲壯雄偉、一節一奏、能鼓蕩人類的血液奇流、也能博動人類的脈膊顫震、他鼓舞了我不少的勇氣、我也把這個異邦的同情者、當作我唯的知音、現在、他正在製作一部偉大的有聲電片、内容有許多新頴的技巧、當他們製作的時候、我常常不間斷的跑去參觀、並</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>且、帶了手記簿與抄録本去、把他們製作時重要的關鍵、聲調、音節、收音發音的快慢、動作和音節的配合、應用機器的方法……等等、他們製作的技巧與法術、現在我差不多已偷得了十分之八、個還有兩分工夫没有到手、大概在一月之中、就可以完成我的工作了、這也就是我漂泊到海外、受了兩年多飢餓、所得的唯一的安慰呵、」</p>
<p>「先生、你的成功、即是中國電影藝術的事業成功、我希望先生把這種偉大的工作完成之後、早日回去、把中國沉寂的電影事業、力加振頓、以光祖國、」</p>
<p>「我本來是這樣想、打算九月間回國、但是、歸途尙是渺茫呵……」</p>
<p>「先生、你在這邊兩年没有做事、你的生活是怎樣維持的、若是没有錢回國、那末、就長久流落在異邦嗎、我想、先生還是設法回去的好、中國的社會雖然是黑暗、至少也要比帝國主義者壓迫之下的殖民地光明得多吧、」</p>
<p>「我何嘗不想回去呵、這兩年生活的情形麽、有時去了畫筆、抽空寫一點稿紙送到報館裏去、可是那代表資本商人廣告的機關、記者、對於窮迫流浪文人的稿子的酬報、非常刻薄、若寫兩千字、除極點、符號、空格以外、只能算一千字的實數、若被披露之後、便可以到報館裏去取兩鈁半錢回來、假如坐馬車去取、兩鈁半錢、就要乾乾脆脆的抵消了、好在我的腿徑還强健、每次寫了文字、還没有落過空、這邊的水菓、倒很便宜、五仙錢可以買得兩磅多香蕉、並且、香蕉又是很容易飽肚皮的東西、因此、我在這邊多半是過的香蕉生活、有時、也要買三仙錢一包的粗糙黄飯充飢哩、」</p>
<p>他說了、又把手裏拿着的一個新鮮油緑香蕉葉子的小包、舉起來結我看、又似乎顯露出不好意思的表情、微微地苦笑了一下、向我點了一點頭、便側轉身子走到隔壁那間深藏着提琴幽靈的房子裏去、他把房門輕輕地關上了、内面靜悄無聲、大概是餓鬼在他的肚子裏閙着飢荒、我猜想他一定是在悄悄地吃包冰冷的黄糙飯、悄悄地過他那藝術家的藝術生活、</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Declares Intention to Cut Off the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Soviet Diplomatic Commissioner Protests to Japanese Ambassador; Japanese Troops Attack Daxing Area, Ma Bu Steadfastly Defends; League of Nations to Hold Executive Council Meeting Today, Shi Representative Arrives in France; Fourth Plenary Session Expresses Determination to Resist Aggression and Struggle</p>
<h3>Jiang Province Army Firmly Defends Daxing Defense Line</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Retreat After Repeated Attacks</p>
<p>Most of Jiang Province Army Concentrated in Tangchi</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin Telegram: Over 1,000 Japanese troops attacked our defense areas of Sanjianfang and Tangchi on the evening of the 14th, causing battles. Four aircraft dropped many bombs. Our army defended with all its strength, holding out for several hours. After 7:00 PM, our army concentrated in Tangchi. Ma Zhanshan has urgently dispatched troops stationed in the provincial capital to reinforce the defense. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the morning of the 14th at 10:00 AM, Japanese troops, with a cavalry and infantry regiment each, attacked our defense lines at Moguxi and Tangchi in two branches, using heavy artillery to cover their troops. They fiercely attacked our trenches three times, throwing many hand grenades. Our army, with the support of mortars, bravely resisted. The position of the Second Battalion of the Wu Brigade retreated to the artillery position due to the Japanese assault. At 11:20 AM, after artillery and infantry reinforcements arrived, the Japanese troops were repelled. For the sake of defense line communication, our army moved the third defense line forward twelve li. (14th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin Telegram: Because our reclamation army concentrated artillery in Jingxingzhen and Zhalaizhen, the Japanese side feared that the Japanese troops south of the Nenjiang Bridge would be attacked from the flanks. Therefore, they temporarily disturbed Xiahezi and Lama Dianzi with cavalry but did not advance directly on Ang'angxi. After the 12th, the Japanese cavalry and artillery launched a swift and fierce attack, but were repelled by our First Cavalry Brigade. Therefore, they are currently feigning negotiation under the guise of discussing conditions, implementing a delaying tactic. Once the 8th Division of Hongqian arrives as reinforcement, a full-scale general attack will be launched. A fierce battle is expected within days. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, a telegram from Harbin stated that the battle between Daxing and Ang'angxi is ongoing. It is reported that the Chinese army fought fiercely for several hours, suffering many casualties. The number of Japanese casualties is unknown. Headquarters of General Honjo also announced this news, stating that 5,000 Heilongjiang troops have made contact with Japanese troops east of Daxing. Ma Zhanshan is currently holding a military conference in Qiqihar. (15th Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The League of Nations Executive Council passed a resolution on October 24, ordering Japanese troops in Manchuria to withdraw to the South Manchuria Railway zone. However, since the Executive Council adjourned on October 25, the position of Japanese troops has not changed at all. Japanese military authorities certainly refuse to announce the distribution of Japanese troops. However, according to Japanese officials, the number of Japanese troops in Manchuria is the same as it was in the days after the September 18th Incident, that is, a total of 13,000 soldiers. The battle between both sides of the Nenjiang River is currently in progress. According to Japanese reports, Heilongjiang cavalry frequently launch attacks, while Japanese troops remain on the defensive. Japanese troops on the front line of the Nenjiang River have moved their outposts forward, approaching the positions defended by the Ma army. Japanese troops carry three-inch caliber field guns, and when the Ma army cavalry approaches on both wings, they bombard them with shrapnel. Yesterday morning, the right wing outpost camp of the Japanese army was attacked by 300 Chinese cavalry. The Japanese army repelled them with artillery fire. Before long, the Chinese cavalry received reinforcements and attacked again. One Japanese soldier was killed and five were injured in the defense. The number of Heilongjiang cavalry is about 600. Although they were repelled, they did not retreat far, so the Japanese army cannot rest easy. However, according to news from Harbin and Beiping, the Chinese army on the Nenjiang River has always taken a defensive posture, and it is the Japanese army that is attacking. According to Japanese official news from the front lines this afternoon, there was a fierce battle in the Nenjiang area this morning. Because Chinese cavalry often assisted their right wing and rear, the Japanese army decided to clear them out and formed a heavy force composed of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, supplemented by aircraft, to attack northeast. As a result, Chinese soldiers were driven back several miles, and Japanese soldiers captured the village of Qian Guangdi (transliteration), which is about 15 miles from the Nenjiang Bridge. Thus, the farthest outpost line of the Japanese army was established. Japanese authorities refuse to announce the number of Japanese troops attacking, but said that the total number of Chinese cavalry repelled was 4,000. The number of Japanese casualties has not yet been reported. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News of the fall of Ang'angxi came from Nanjing, but according to declarations here today, it is groundless. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Extremely Brutal</h3>
<p>One Battalion of Zhang HaiPeng's Troops Crossing the River Was Completely Sunk by Japanese Artillery Fire</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin Telegram: Zhang HaiPeng's army was originally a rabble. Although they fought under the command of Japanese officers, more than 2,000 of the 6,000 men deserted with their weapons. Domoto is very dissatisfied with Zhang, saying that his subordinates often mutiny, wasting weapons and hindering combat plans. Zhang is very afraid. A certain company of the newly formed 25th Battalion of Zhang's troops, when crossing the river to advance north, colluded with a certain country's officer with Zhang's consent. First, they tricked the battalion out of its weapons, and after all of them boarded the boats, they set up artillery on the riverbank and sank more than a dozen ferries one by one. None of the soldiers in the company survived. Afterwards, a certain party falsely claimed that it was done by the Heilongjiang army. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gunfire Erupts Again in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Obstructs Search Operations, Wang ShuChang Meets with Japanese Commander, Japanese Residents, Women and Children Return to Their Country One After Another</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Gunfire erupted again on the evening of the 15th (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the evening of the 15th, Japanese soldiers buried three landmines on the Chinese territory north of Huayuan Street and raised the second line of defense sandbags, indicating ill intentions. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Relief Society rescued more than 200 refugees from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 15th. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 15th, two more batches of Japanese women and children, totaling more than 100 people, left Tianjin for Tanggu, where they boarded ships to return to their country. Including those who left Tianjin on the 14th, the total reached 800 people. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Relief Society rescued more than 200 refugees on the 15th. The municipal government allocated 20,000 yuan for relief and 5,000 yuan for comforting police officers. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the afternoon of the 14th, the Security Team executed ten plainclothes agents at Ningjia Bridge. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The inspection of plainclothes agents was originally an unintentional act. Due to the Japanese side's request, our side agreed to their request. On the 14th, each side dispatched 40 soldiers and police, and one civil and military official, to inspect simultaneously in two locations: one at Haiguang Temple and one at the Zha Kou. However, the inspection at Haiguang Temple was also perfunctory. The Japanese troops occupied and controlled six offices in the second district and refused the inspection altogether. During the inspection at Zha Kou, Japanese soldiers saw a power grid set up in front of the Second Telephone Bureau and said that military installations should not be present within 300 meters. Our side explained that the telephone bureau was related to domestic and foreign communications and could not be without proper protection. The Japanese side still did not understand and stopped the inspection. It was originally planned that Japanese soldiers would retreat 70 meters after the inspection, and Chinese and Japanese police would resume their posts, but none of this was carried out. The Japanese Consul also telegraphed Tokyo and notified the consuls in Tianjin, saying that China did not abide by the agreement and still set up power grids, sandbags, and other military defenses within 300 meters of the Japanese Concession, and that three Chinese security team members were found within 300 meters, but no plainclothes agents were found. This shows that Japan absolutely did not harbor plainclothes agents. These three security team members were the ones who fired at and killed Japanese officers and soldiers in the Japanese Concession. At the same time, he telegraphed the Japanese ambassador in Beijing and protested to the provincial and municipal authorities. Our provincial and municipal authorities endured humiliation and sought compromise. On the evening of the 14th, they sent representatives Liu JiaHong and Ning XiangNan to apologize to the Japanese Consul General Kuwashima. On the afternoon of the 15th, the security team in front of the Second Telephone Bureau was ordered to withdraw, the power grid was removed within 200 meters, and the defenses were destroyed to show sincerity. Our side wanted the Japanese Concession to remove its military installations and resume its posts, and ordered the Japanese soldiers to withdraw from the six offices in the second district, but the Japanese side did not give a satisfactory answer and asked our side to lend the Nan Guan Xiatou Sino-Western Women's School to the Japanese army for office use, which our side refused. Kuwashima arranged for the mayor to meet at the consulate again on the evening of the 15th. In short, the situation has now progressed from riots and conflicts to direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, and the diplomatic situation is not optimistic. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, there was still gunfire in the Chinese Concession, but it stopped after a while. It is as calm as usual between Japan and China. The situation has eased slightly. There are gradually more pedestrians in the Chinese Concession, unlike the desolation of the past few days. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin has returned to normal yesterday and today, and people's hearts are gradually settling down. Consuls from various countries in Tianjin are discussing solutions. However, passengers arriving and departing at the station are subject to strict checks. Yesterday, 150 Japanese women and children took the Beining train to Shenyang and then returned to their country. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The security team has resumed its posts near the Chinese territory bordering the Japanese Concession in Tianjin. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to inquiries from the Chinese side, Chinese authorities sent representatives to visit the Japanese military commander to explain the discovery of Chinese police in the neutral zone. The Japanese commander did not receive them and demanded that Wang Shuchang and Zhang Xueming come to see him in person. Zhang Xueming happened to be ill. Wang Shuchang went alone to see him at 5:00 PM today. The Japanese commander received him cordially and talked for more than two hours. The content is unknown. The reporter entered the Chinese territory in the afternoon and saw many people gathered outside the pawnshop, holding clothes and waiting to pawn them. It is heard that famine relief measures are now being actively implemented, but food is scarce and riots are feared. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council of Tianjin Inspects Chinese Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The French Municipal Council notified all Chinese newspapers on the evening of the 14th that all news drafts must be submitted for inspection from the 14th onwards. Under this chaotic situation, the newspapers had no choice but to obey. This is truly a precedent for foreigners interfering with Chinese freedom of speech. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Doihara Escorts Puyi and Others to Shenyang</h3>
<p>Jin Liang and Others Prepare for Restoration Work</p>
<p>(Beiping) Puyi, accompanied by Doihara and former Qing Dynasty officials and remnants, was transported to Shenyang by a special flower car on the South Manchuria Railway. Puyi is residing in the old palace. Jin Liang and others are busy preparing for restoration work. Puyi is scheduled to ascend the throne at 10:00 AM on the 15th. The false country name will still be the Great Qing, but the reign name will be Mingguang. The system of Grand Councilors and Six Ministries will be used, not the cabinet system. The appointed Grand Councilors include Puwei, Zheng Xiaoxu, Yuan Jinkai, and Jin Liang. Honjo ordered Jin Liang to repair the Forbidden City and complete it within days. The former Northeast Telecommunications Management Office, located across from the Forbidden City, has been designated as the Grand Council. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese dignitaries are secretly meeting in Shenyang. After the Mingguang Empire is realized, Japan will be the first to recognize it as an independent country and request the League of Nations Council to allow it to join the League of Nations as a member. This matter will be difficult for the League of Nations to recognize, but it will further complicate the Northeast issue. Japan and the Mingguang Empire, the League of Nations and China, and our country and the Northeast will form a multi-faceted and delicate relationship. The Japanese poisonous scheme is hateful, and the shameless Chinese who are willing to be puppets deserve to be punished. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese semi-official sources, Puyi ascended the throne in Shenyang this morning and announced himself as the Manchu Emperor, with Puwei as Prime Minister. It is heard that a notice will be sent to all countries regarding the restoration of the Great Qing Dynasty. Japan will declare the withdrawal of troops, and Puyi will retain them to maintain order and protect the throne. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Daily commented on rumors of Puyi's attempt to restore the throne, saying, "Whether this move has the support of a considerable number of people or is merely a fluke will be proven in the near future. In short, Puyi's actions constitute a new and dangerous element that may affect relations between China and Russia." (15th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tonight, a Reuters reporter visited a famous Chinese person closest to Puyi's household affairs. According to reports, Puyi still resides in Tianjin. As to whether he is in the Japanese Concession or elsewhere, this person refused to disclose, but said that Puyi will go to Manchuria within days. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official telegrams today, Puyi has arrived in Niuzhuang. However, the report that Puyi had arrived in Shenyang and resided with Yuan Jinkai has not been verified. When Japanese authorities were asked what policy Japan would take if Puyi announced himself emperor, the reply was that the question had not been seriously considered, because although the leaders of the independent governments of Manchuria supported restoration, the enthronement would not be realized for the time being.

<h3>Honjo Disregards Good Faith, Declares Intention to Advance on Longjiang</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Receives Another Notification from Honjo Shigeru Correcting the Demand Letter Submitted on the 12th</p>
<p>Stating That Japanese Troops Should Advance to Longjiang Station, Our Side Replied That This Demand Was Unreasonable</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qiqihar Telegram: Ma Zhanshan received from Lin Xiuyi on the afternoon of the 13th a corrected version of the demand letter submitted by Honjo Shigeru yesterday. The notification is as follows: "To Chairman Ma, Regarding the demand letter submitted by the Commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo, on November 12, Showa 6, the following items should be corrected due to unclear telegrams and misrecorded text: Upon examination of your reply received on the evening of the 12th, there are discrepancies. We hope to receive a reply by noon on the 14th. The following Japanese troops should advance to Ang'angxi Station on the Tao'ang Line for the sake of the safety protection of the Tao'ang Line." The corrected text is "The following Japanese troops should advance to Longjiang Station on the Tao'ang Line for the sake of the safety protection of the Tao'ang Line." This is to notify you. It can be seen that the Japanese are pressing closer step by step, with no good faith. Please announce to the League of Nations immediately for a fair judgment. Our reply is as follows: "In response to your two letters, regarding the Ang'angxi Station being mistaken for Longjiang, Longjiang Station is originally a station on the Qike Line, while the terminal station of the Tao'ang Line is Ang'angxi Station. Now, if your army guarantees the safety of the Tao'ang Line, you should say that you are advancing to Longjiang Station. I think your commander must be mistaken. This special reply is for your reference. To His Excellency Commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo." (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Major Lin, claiming to be a representative of Honjo, visited Ma Zhanshan again on the 14th. According to reports, regarding the explanation of Ma's ultimatum conveyed on the afternoon of the 12th, Japanese troops will occupy Ang'angxi Station on the Tao'ang Railway. Now Honjo has another note stating that Ang'angxi is Qiqihar and limiting Ma to reply by 12:00 AM on the 14th. Ma replied, "Japan's occupation of the Tao'ang Railway is still under the pretext that the road was built with Japanese loans. The terminal station of the road is Ang'angxi Station. I do not know on what basis Honjo wants Japanese troops to occupy Qiqihar. Moreover, your representative's words have been inconsistent and incoherent in recent days, resembling child's play. There is really no need to accept them." After Lin left, Ma immediately telegraphed Vice Zhang about the situation and requested that it be reported to the central government and submitted to the League of Nations so that the world could hear about the insidious schemes of the violent Japanese. Small portrait of General Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Major Lin saw Ma Zhanshan again this morning, saying that Honjo demanded that Ma not comply, and the Japanese army will cut off the western line of the Chinese Eastern Railway to cut off the Heilongjiang army's return route, and then take BuKui directly. Ma replied that he has a responsibility to defend the territory and will seriously guard it. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the Ministry of the Army fears that the Chinese army will destroy the newly built bridge over the river after the Japanese army withdraws from the Nenjiang River, it has ordered Honjo to leave troops to defend the bridgehead. According to official declarations, Honjo has been ordered to submit a new ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara needs to consult with Consul General Hayashi in Shenyang on the situation in the East, and has ordered him to return to the country. Hayashi departed from Shenyang last night. (15th Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo received conflicting telegrams today regarding Ma Zhanshan's battle. According to a dispatch from the Harbin News Agency, Consul Representative Shimizu and Military Representative Major Lin went to persuade General Ma Zhanshan to withdraw the troops from Qiqihar and the surrounding areas of Ang'angxi and arrived in Harbin this morning with four other Japanese. It is said that the negotiations were ineffective. The *Nichinichi Shimbun* carried an earlier telegram stating that a part of the agreement had been reached and Ma had agreed to a ceasefire. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Military Representative Major Lin of the Japanese Consulate in Qiqihar delivered the conditions for the Japanese withdrawal of troops from the Nenjiang area to General Ma Zhanshan this morning, including the withdrawal of Ma's troops from the Qiqihar and Ang'angxi area, the non-stationing of Ma's troops south of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the implementation of these conditions on November 25. The Japanese military authorities are now eagerly awaiting Ma's reply, which is expected to arrive tomorrow. In addition, the area along the South Manchuria Railway has recently been rife with bandits. The Japanese authorities hope to transfer the troops stationed far away in the Nenjiang River back to assist in the defense. In addition, the weather is getting colder and colder, and the soldiers cannot bear it. However, it is heard that Honjo still firmly advocates that Japanese soldiers should be stationed there for a long time to maintain the traffic on the Tao'ang Railway. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Dawes Only Shows Himself Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador to France Meets with Briand</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Executive Council will meet here at 4:00 PM tomorrow (Shanghai standard time approximately 12:00 PM). The atmosphere in Paris does not show a conciliatory spirit. Rumors that Japan is preparing important concessions and compromise measures are believed in Geneva, but people in Paris do not believe it. The Japanese side has not shown any signs of changing its position. A Reuters reporter interviewed one of the main Japanese representatives today and learned that Japan does not want to give up its five basic points and must first be satisfied on these five points before considering withdrawing troops to the railway area. US Ambassador to the UK, Dawes, has published an article saying that the US government or he himself has no expectation of attending the Executive Council meeting. This statement has caused disappointment among those who sympathize with the League of Nations, as those who sympathize with the League of Nations deeply hoped that Dawes would appear at the meeting in the final period. Now, not only is Dawes not seen on the scene, but even seeing Gilbert standing behind the scenes is feared to be impossible. Although this matter has not been publicly recognized as a major victory for Japan, the advantage of the Japanese viewpoint is indeed unquestionable. The weight of Dawes' power will certainly be felt behind the scenes, but observers in the meeting will not see the American's diplomacy. Soviet Russian Ambassador to France Dovgalevsky visited Briand yesterday. It is said that the Russian ambassador's visit was to tell Briand that the Soviet Union's interests in Manchuria are no less than those of the United States, and Briand probably told him that there were no US representatives present. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Russian sources here deny the claim that the Russian ambassador mentioned the Manchurian issue when he met with the French Foreign Minister, saying that the Soviet Union is completely uninvolved in Sino-Japanese negotiations. In short, the Soviet Union is unwilling to cooperate with the League of Nations in any intervention. What the Russian ambassador and the French Foreign Minister discussed were mostly commercial relations between Russia and France. French officials are unwilling to comment on the rumors about the Russian-French talks. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Secretariat Publishes Chinese and Japanese Documents</h3>
<p>Japanese People Distort Facts in Hopes of Disrupting Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Secretariat published the contents of documents from the Chinese and Japanese delegations. The Chinese document includes an English translation of a Japanese note to China regarding the Tianjin riots, and another one requesting the League of Nations to strictly stop Japan's hostile actions and quickly dispatch neutral observers. The Japanese document has three items, published at the same time. One claims that the Tanaka Memorial on Manchurian policy is a forgery for Chinese propaganda purposes. Another claims that the Manchurian situation repeatedly claimed by the Chinese representatives is not factual and intends to sway public opinion and cause people to doubt the Japanese government's declaration and the sincerity of its intention to respect international obligations. The Japanese government deeply regrets this attitude, as it creates greater disturbances and provides an extremely unfair view of the situation. This kind of Chinese statement has disrupted public opinion and created a very sad and undesirable mentality by the League of Nations. The Chinese representatives are now planning to use active propaganda to distort the facts. This document was signed by Arakawa and sent from Paris on November 12. The third document from the Japanese representatives is a telegram they received regarding the distribution of troops in Manchuria. It claims that the main Japanese force in the Nenjiang area is currently stationed in Daxing, while Ma Zhanshan's main force is concentrated near Ang'angxi, with sentries placed on the east-west lines and Tangchi (transliteration) as the center. Currently, they are taking encirclement actions. Ma's troops outnumber the Japanese troops by a factor of ten. The distance between the two armies ranges from four kilometers to eight kilometers. The harm suffered by the Japanese troops is gradually becoming urgent. At the same time, many telegrams from various parts of China were sent to Ma Zhanshan, urging him to take offensive actions, and Harbin has a particularly hostile spirit, creating a very dangerous atmosphere. Chinese troops are currently advancing towards Taonan, endangering the right wing of the Japanese army. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>Asks League of Nations to Intervene in the Critical Situation in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji has arrived in Paris. Dawes will visit him today and plans to see Yoshizawa. Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira will also arrive in Paris today. Japanese Ambassador to Rome Yoshida is rumored not to be coming here. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Chinese Chief Representative Shi sent a document to the League of Nations, requesting the Council to quickly intervene in the critical situation in Tianjin to prevent hostile actions by the Japanese side, and to immediately select neutral observers from the foreign troops stationed in Tianjin and Beijing to go to the Japanese Concession. An attached note is a letter from Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which requested China to withdraw its troops and police from Tianjin, no different from an ultimatum. The letter stated that otherwise, the Japanese authorities would exercise their rights under the exchange of notes to protect the lives and property of the Japanese Concession and Japanese residents. China will bear full responsibility for the consequences of such actions. Shi added a note stating that, based on the experience gained in the past two months, such intimidation may be followed by hostile actions. Therefore, he urgently requested the Council to intervene to prevent the Japanese from taking hostile actions again. In addition, Shi also listed seven items detailing the Japanese interference in the salt administration of the three eastern provinces and the seizure of salt taxes, and reported them in detail to the Council.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>From October 24th to Today</h3>
<p>The world-矚目 [world's attention] November 16th. It has now arrived before our eyes without the slightest hesitation. The League of Nations' resolution limiting the Japanese army to withdraw before November 16th has now formally declared its ineffectiveness. People from all countries around the world who care about international peace, under this grave fact, what they feel is it the sorrow after disappointment? Or is it the anxiety and distress of witnessing peace on the verge of desperation?</p>
<p>Since October 24th, when the League of Nations officially resolved to advise the Japanese army to withdraw before today, the Japanese atrocities have not only not diminished in the slightest, but have continued to expand, making the situation even more dangerous. Since October 24th, the atrocities that the Japanese have revealed to the world are: forcing Chairman Ma Dai of Heilongjiang Province to step down with the so-called friendship note and ceding Qiqihar; violently attacking our Heilongjiang Province, and the war is now expanding day by day; inciting the Tianjin Incident, causing terror and unrest throughout our country; abducting Puyi to Fengtian, and organizing the extremely ridiculous so-called Ming Guang Empire. These facts are enough to prove that the Japanese have the determination to open the prelude to the Second World War. On the other hand, it has thoroughly exposed the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is now unwilling to end its life immediately. It will now hold three meetings to make a third effort. However, the arrow at the end of its flight has already weakened, and the position of the great powers is not truly based on justice and righteousness. As analyzed in yesterday's commentary, then the three meetings will still be unable to solve this unique difficult situation. We can easily make a judgment with a little thought.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' three meetings have been moved to Paris. A very large map of our Northeast is also hung in the meeting hall, so that representatives of all countries can clearly understand the situation in the Northeast at a glance. Its meaning is as if to say, "Let all countries carefully look at this piece of fat meat. Carefully identify this piece of fat meat." At the same time, it is further confirmed by the recent organization of international police and the high-pitched talk of organizing international troops to maintain order in the Northeast. The third meeting of the international community, rather than saying that it is discussing and resolving the serious situation in the Northeast and discussing methods to maintain world peace, it is better to say that the great powers are planning how to make China fall into an even more tragic situation, so that each can achieve what they want.</p>
<p>The United States has not made a serious and powerful statement to this day. Now Dawes has been ordered to go to Paris, but he has stated that he does not need to attend the council meeting. Furthermore, it will not be possible to seek to see Gilbart behind the scenes as before. Its public opinion has suddenly changed its attitude and openly made pro-Japanese remarks. We have long suspected the attitude of the United States, and now it is gradually revealing its true face. Since the United States has expressed itself in this way, the League of Nations certainly has no ability to resolve the Northeast Incident. The United States intends to thoroughly expose the incompetence of the League of Nations. Until the end, it may use its financial power as the center and slowly come out to mediate, in order to further show its rise to the position of world hegemony. However, even if the United States really comes out to mediate in the future, it will not be of any benefit to our country, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, before today, I still had a glimmer of hope for world peace. After today, peace has truly reached a tragic state. All the people of the world have been shrouded in a cloud of terror and persecution.</p>
<p>If the third meeting of the League of Nations does not come out as we predicted, and there is still no result, what will our government do? The committee for receiving the lost territories of Liaoning and Jilin has been organized. However, the atrocities of the Japanese army, which are being carried out from Liaoning and Jilin, are just beginning. In Heilongjiang Province, General Ma Zhanshan is still in the midst of a bitter struggle. The situation in the Northeast is like this, and the international situation is like that. After today, what should our government do? Will it still appeal to the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and call for elusive justice and righteousness? Or will it make final preparations and strive to save itself? The eyes of the people are now focused on the government, and they deeply hope that our government will take urgent action to plan, and all the people will spare no sacrifice to support the government.</p>

<h3>American Newspapers Protect Brutal Japan and Highly Praising US-Japan Friendship</h3>
<p>New York American newspapers have always supported China in their discussions of the Three Eastern Provinces Incident, but in the past two weeks, they have been poisoned by Japanese propaganda and have completely changed to supporting Japan. Except for the World Telegram, almost all New York newspapers are now pro-Japanese. The New York Herald Tribune, a Republican and current government newspaper, stated in its editorial today that the League of Nations' mediation was a mistake, and that the Japanese military action was an unavoidable reaction to China's policy of abolishing unequal treaties. The New York Evening Post said, "Japan is a strong country, and we are willing to be friendly with it." (14th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>

They also gave speeches along the way, denouncing the League of Nations. The inside of Shenyang was very quiet, and no one paid attention to this parade. However, some Chinese also participated in it, because the Japanese announced yesterday that Chinese shops in the Japanese residential area must send at least one representative to join the parade.

<h3>Soviet Russia Protests to Japan Against Malicious Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>Demanding Japan Maintain its Promises Regarding Soviet Interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Moscow) Because the Japanese army could not win the attack on Heilongjiang for a while, it promoted internationally how Soviet Russia was assisting the Chinese army, etc. This has caused a dispute between Japan and Russia, and the Japanese side has continued its propaganda policy. As a result, Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov presented an oral note to the Japanese ambassador today, instructing the Japanese ambassador to forward it to the Japanese government, stating that the Soviet Russian authorities have not provided any form of assistance to the Chinese Eastern Province army. Therefore, the Japanese government should immediately ban the malicious propaganda of its affiliated army. Although the note is generally peaceful, the facts it refers to are extremely firm, and the wording is very strong, stating that Japan's propaganda is an unconscious and false structure, and that its various rumors are spread by irresponsible parties. It is obvious that it has the intention of provoking the current situation in the Eastern Province. Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissioner Karakhan felt the need to correct it on October 29th, etc. The note also stated that Russia has a consistent policy in the Chinese Eastern Province and other places, namely, maintaining peace, respecting international treaties, and the security and independence of other countries' territories. Soviet Russia's policy has been declared to the world again and again, so all countries in the world should trust Soviet Russia and should no longer slander it with rumors and arbitrarily provoke it. Moreover, when your ambassador previously declared this policy to the Soviet Russian government, he stated that the Japanese government had sincerely accepted it and expressed satisfaction. Now it is constantly slandering, which is truly strange. Therefore, the Soviet Russian government has to request the attention of the Japanese government with an extremely regrettable attitude. The Japanese military should immediately stop using newspapers, news agencies, and official false propaganda. Furthermore, your ambassador previously stated that the actions of the Japanese army in the Chinese Eastern Province will never infringe on Russian interests. According to reports, the Japanese army is actively preparing to cross the Chinese Eastern Railway line and advance towards Qiqihar. If this is the case, the traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway will inevitably be interrupted, and Soviet Russia will inevitably suffer material losses. Therefore, Soviet Russia especially hopes that Japan can abide by the previous declarations and not cancel its promises. (14th Kuomintang Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Figures Hold a Pessimistic View of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Unwilling to Express Opinion on Manchurian Case Before Departing for Paris</p>
<p>London Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon, his entourage, and the Japanese Ambassador to London Matsudaira and several of his secretaries departed for Paris at 10:45 this morning to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. The British people cannot be said to be optimistic about the outcome of this meeting today, and instead harbor fears that the League of Nations will suffer great humiliation, as it is the general opinion that Japan has no intention of accepting the League of Nations' orders. However, the political circles have great confidence in Sir John Simon's negotiating talents and hope that he can give the League of Nations new guidance. The Sunday Times said that Japan is a commercial country and relies heavily on the Chinese market. Its greatest interest lies in peace, and perhaps this can inspire hope that the war can be reversed. The Public Opinion newspaper commented on the overall situation in the Three Eastern Provinces, recalling previous events, saying that if Japan had dared to submit to the League of Nations for adjudication at the beginning of the dispute, the war would have been reversed long ago. Before Sir John Simon departed for Paris, someone asked him to express his opinion on the Manchurian case. Sir John Simon politely declined. However, a Reuters reporter interviewed an official from the Foreign Office, who said that Sir John Simon's return date depends on the progress of the Administrative Council's discussions. It is expected that he may return to London by the end of the week. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Talks About the Future of Receiving the Northeast</h3>
<p>When Our Country is Desperate for the League of Nations, it Will Inevitably Strive for National Self-Preservation and Will Never Wait to Die</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun said that since the League of Nations has a resolution on the Eastern Province Incident, in theory, both China and Japan can only obey. Our country expressed its acceptance of the seven measures set by the League of Nations and has prepared to implement them, so the obligation has been fulfilled. The blame for undermining the credibility and dignity of the League of Nations lies entirely with the Japanese side. Our country should reiterate its previous request at the League of Nations meeting tomorrow, and the League of Nations' responsibility should of course be to seek further effective methods to urge Japan to implement it. Otherwise, the League of Nations' power and significance will be swept away. Regarding the restrictive methods of Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, if Japan consistently violates international law and credibility, the League of Nations will have the root to implement it at the final stage. In terms of procedures in the near future, it must be promoted step by step and may not take this approach immediately. The power of the League of Nations lies in the absolute obedience of member states, and at the same time, it can be assisted by fair public opinion from around the world, so that measures can be taken easily. According to personal observations, the League of Nations' fair claim on this case will definitely be able to exert its power to achieve the end. If this case cannot be resolved, not only will peace in East Asia soon be blown up, but I am afraid that the great terror of the world is also just around the corner. On the surface, the League of Nations is maintaining peace between China and Japan, but in reality, it is eliminating the great war for the second time in the world. The relationship in the future is so important that it is expected that the League of Nations will do its best to deal with it. In the event that our country is desperate for the League of Nations, it will inevitably seek national self-preservation based on the psychology of human beings' desire for survival, and will never wait to die. As for the receiving committee, our side has prepared the necessary procedures separately, but the other party has not agreed on the receiving details and implementation methods. We must wait for the League of Nations to meet on the 16th before deciding on the steps. Regarding the supervisory personnel of various countries participating in the reception, although various countries have been assigned, they have now been shelved in invisible form. Considering the current relationship, Soviet Russia itself may not be willing to participate in this meeting of the League of Nations. However, it is also one of the signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If a meeting of the signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact is convened, it should also participate. It is not yet certain whether the League of Nations is preparing to invite Soviet Russia to participate at this moment. Puyi was abducted to Shenyang by the Japanese, which may cause major changes and is worthy of attention. In short, the Japanese side's destructive tricks have reached the point where all arrows are fired, but we only see its painstaking efforts becoming more and more clumsy. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fourth Plenary Session Issues External Declaration</h3>
<p>Arouse Serious Attention from Various Countries</p>
<p>Express Determination to Fight Against Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the first meeting of the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang on the afternoon of the 14th, it was resolved to issue an external declaration, on the one hand, to arouse serious attention from the international community to Japanese atrocities, and on the other hand, to express the determination to resist aggression. This declaration has been telegraphed to various countries. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang believes that the serious situation of Japan's violation of international law, the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, undermining international peace, and wantonly infringing upon China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity is not only related to China's survival but also to the safety of the world's people. We hereby declare the firm will of the entire party and the people of the whole country as follows: On September 18, the Japanese army attacked Shenyang and successively occupied important cities in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Two months have passed in an instant. At the beginning of the incident, China immediately requested the International League of Nations to handle it, hoping to use the sanctions related to the international guarantee of peace to uphold justice and reason. The Administrative Council of the International League of Nations unanimously resolved on September 30 to order Japan to withdraw its troops and set the deadline for the completion of the troop withdrawal before the next meeting of the Administrative Council on October 14. This resolution was also formally declared by Japan to be accepted. During this period, the Chinese government respected the international resolution, tried its best to avoid any conflict, and took extra care to protect Japanese residents, so that no unfortunate incidents occurred. However, the Japanese army not only did not show any signs of withdrawal, but instead attacked Jinzhou with airplanes, bombed the Beining Railway, expanded the occupied area, and sent more warships to show their power in coastal ports and the Yangtze River ports. Therefore, the international community convened an early meeting on October 13, and on October 24, unanimously passed a resolution, except for Japan, clearly stipulating that Japan must complete the withdrawal of troops before November 16, and that the Chinese government would take over all places occupied by Japanese troops. The Chinese government respected the League of Nations' resolution and, in addition to appointing responsible personnel to take over and notifying the Japanese government in accordance with the resolution, also fulfilled all other obligations of the Chinese side regarding the resolution. Neutral observers were also appointed early. However, Japan disregarded the previous resolution and ignored it completely, and implemented various acts of sabotage and obstruction, making it impossible to realize the peace that China and its friendly countries worked together for. Later, Chairman Briand sent a reply to Japan on November 2, stating that the resolution still had sufficient power to be implemented and did not recognize that Japan's treaty rights in the Three Eastern Provinces were related to the safety of the lives and property of Japanese people, and called on Japan to fulfill its obligation to withdraw its troops quickly. However, Japan not only delayed withdrawing its troops, but also increased its troops and occupied places such as Taonan, repeatedly attacked Tongliao, attacked the Chinese army in Nenjiang, and attempted to attack Qiqihar, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang. It also instigated Chinese bandits and restoration parties to organize illegal governments in Liaoning, Ningxia, and Jilin to carry out independence movements, making it difficult for China to carry out the reception. It also extracted salt tax revenue in Yingkou, Changchun, and other places, directly destroying China's finances and indirectly affecting China's ability to bear foreign economic burdens. Since November 8, it has even used bandits in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, armed them, and launched attacks on Chinese public security bureaus and other administrative agencies from the concession. Moreover, cannons were fired from the Japanese barracks many times to bombard the territory under Chinese jurisdiction. Not only has it been seen and heard by people from various countries, but also the shells and guns are all in evidence. Such an undeclared act of hostility is the most vicious in the world. It is not only a violation of all international treaties and international law, but also a direct destruction and challenge to civilization, humanity, and the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. During this period, Japan still insisted that China must first recognize its five basic principles and conduct direct negotiations, using the excuse of its five basic principles. It is clear that Japan wants to force our China to recognize its demands under the threat of its military force. The Chinese people, for the sake of the dignity of international conventions, cannot but raise the following five extremely profound questions regarding Japan's international cunning and embellishment of the so-called treaty rights, as evidenced by Japan's actions since September 18: (1) Is the League of Nations Covenant effective? Why can Japan disregard the provisions of the Covenant and openly violate the League of Nations' resolution? Should the League of Nations invoke the provisions of Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant and impose proper sanctions? (2) Is the Kellogg-Briand Pact effective? Why did the Japanese army openly attack our Chinese army and implement its policy of aggression by force? Should the signatory countries immediately correct its breach of contract? (3) Is the Washington Nine-Power Treaty effective? Why did Japan openly infringe upon our sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity? Have the signatory countries salvaged its breach of contract? (4) Are the concessions of Japan in Chinese territory limited to the general rules of peaceful commerce and residence? Is it permissible for it to use the concession status in Tianjin as a source of conspiracy to undermine China? (5) In order to guarantee China's salt tax that should fulfill its debts to various countries, Japan arbitrarily extracts it. It goes without saying that it destroys our country's finances, but are these actions acts that hinder our country from fulfilling its treaty obligations? It seems that it forces our country to unilaterally respect its so-called treaty rights, while its own actions of disregarding treaties and even destroying treaties are emerging one after another. Japan will not only be the chief culprit in destroying international peace, but also the culprit in destroying the dignity of treaties. Now the League of Nations Administrative Council is about to reconvene, and this conference solemnly calls on the member states of the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty to pay serious attention, so that they know that Japan has long regarded international conventions as waste paper since September 18, and China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity have been actually destroyed by Japan. This conference firmly advocates that the National Government should quickly prepare its strength to recover the Three Eastern Provinces, guarantee the completeness of China's territorial sovereignty, and not allow it to suffer the slightest loss. It also hopes that the League of Nations will implement the provisions of Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant at this meeting and quickly impose effective sanctions on Japan's aggression. It also hopes that the friendly countries that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty will fulfill their obligations under their respective covenants, so that peace in the Far East and the world will not be destroyed by Japan, justice and humanity will not be succumbed to by force, and the dignity of the League of Nations and international treaties will not be lost as a result. Japan's military occupation of the Three Eastern Provinces has been going on for two months, and China's patience has reached its limit. If Japan continues to disregard the League of Nations' advocacy of justice and disrespect the dignity of international conventions, and the League of Nations and friendly countries fail to fulfill the sacred obligations of their signatory countries, the Chinese nation will protect the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and will not hesitate to make any major sacrifices in order to exercise the right of national survival and self-defense. Resistance for survival and self-defense is the right of an independent country and is permitted by international law. This conference will lead our entire Chinese nation to fight to the end and vow not to yield to brutal force in order to protect international justice and fulfill the sacred responsibility of our signatory countries for international conventions. This is the declaration. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Fourth National Congress Passed a Proposal to Strictly Defend Territorial Integrity and Handed It Over to the National Government for Effective Handling</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Representative Liu Jiashu and 42 other representatives of the Fourth National Congress proposed a motion to strictly order all provincial civil and military officials to take proper defense measures when encountering foreign invasion, strictly defend the territory, and coexist with the city in life and death, without abandoning their posts. The reason for this proposal is that the incident in the Eastern Provinces (Manchuria) resulted in the loss of thousands of miles of territory in less than ten days. This not only caused enormous losses to our country but also created an unprecedented humiliation. This shows the folly of the policy of non-resistance. In the future, we should learn from the past and correct this. The existence of a country in the world must be based on its complete sovereignty. If a violent force invades our territory and slaughters our people, taking proper defense is a necessary national act. Recently, General Ma Zhanshan fought bravely against the enemy and was able to protect our territory and blunt the enemy's aggression. His loyalty to his duty is commendable. Officials everywhere have the responsibility to defend their territory and coexist with the city in life and death, which is their duty. In the future, to protect our national rights and defend our territory, the Congress should resolve that the central government strictly order all civil and military officials in all regions to take proper defense measures when encountering foreign invasion and not to abandon their posts, so as to avoid the cutting off of the national lifeline and the loss of sovereignty, etc. The proposal was passed by the First Congress and handed over to the National Government for effective handling.

Chairman Liu Zhi said that if the Red bandits are not suppressed, it will be difficult to resist Japan, so we should concentrate our efforts to eliminate them. Xiong Shihui then spoke about the need for convenient transportation in suppressing the Communists and the need to support the economic development of farmers. Cheng Tianfang, Lu Dipin, Duan Xipeng, and others gave speeches, and it was decided that each province should elect one representative to form a drafting committee on the issue of suppressing the bandits to formulate a plan and submit it to the Congress for discussion and implementation. (Fifteenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives Yang Yifeng, Shang Zhen, Liu Zhenhua, Ma Fuxiang, and 46 others submitted a proposal requesting the National Government to quickly deploy a large army to encircle and suppress the Red bandits in the area where the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui meet. The party, government, and military of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui should organize a committee to suppress the bandits to handle all affairs in the bandit areas in order to eliminate the source of the bandits and establish the people's livelihood. The main points are as follows: (1) The National Government should quickly deploy a large army and deploy it to the key points of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui to take a surrounding posture and advance at the opportune time. (2) The party, government, and military of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui should each elect one person to form a committee to handle all affairs in the bandit areas. All existing party, government, and military organs in the bandit areas should be under its command. (3) Fully supply the local militias in the bandit areas with bullets so that they can serve as a vanguard in suppressing the bandits, thereby achieving the effect of military-civilian cooperation. (4) Expedite emergency relief in the bandit areas to comfort the refugees. (5) Pay salaries to the personnel suppressing the bandits and set a strict deadline to ensure effectiveness.

<p>(Nanjing) The Finance Committee issued the following declaration: This committee held its first meeting on November 15, 1931, and unanimously agreed that domestic wars should absolutely not occur, and that all national troops should be used exclusively for national defense. In this autumn of national crisis, national finance should be tightened as much as possible. Therefore, a temporary budget for the period of national crisis tightening is hereby stipulated, reducing military expenses to 18 million yuan per month and administrative expenses to 4 million yuan, with the exception of the total amount of central education expenses, which will not be reduced. In addition to the Ministry of Finance issuing a separate revenue and expenditure budget, this is hereby declared. According to this budget, the highest military and political organs have taken the lead in earnestly implementing it as an example for the whole country. Furthermore, the public bonds and treasury bills issued by the National Government have always had a strong reputation, and now that the budget has been tightened, the reputation will be even more solid. The government must be responsible for maintaining it. On the one hand, the government will continue to vigorously promote domestic industries and develop the national economy, so that the national financial resources can be increased, and future budgets can also be expanded accordingly. This committee is well aware that the current national financial difficulties are largely due to natural disasters, bandit troubles, and the Northeast Incident. Once the original situation is restored, the national tax revenue can be increased, and it will not be difficult to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure by the time the budget set by this committee expires.

The division headquarters is currently stationed in Yulin. The division has 12,000 men and complete weaponry. However, in early November, Pu Zihua, the commander of the 24th Army of the Red Army, led more than 1,000 Red bandits from Fuping County, Hebei Province, to the Fugu and Shenmu areas of northern Shaanxi. Several divisions were dispatched to encircle and suppress them. All were captured, and more than 70 firearms were seized. The fake army commander Pu Zihua was also captured and executed on the spot. The rest were given money and sent away. Northern Shaanxi is close to Inner Mongolia and is most susceptible to being infected with communism. National defense is important. This time, attending the Fourth National Congress, he intends to give a detailed report on the situation in the Northwest and has also drafted proposals for the Congress to adopt, emphasizing the stationing of troops for reclamation. If the inland troops can be moved to the frontier for reclamation, not only will national defense be consolidated, but it will also be a way to enrich the country.

<h3>The Sensational Narcotics Trafficking Case Opens Today in Basel, Switzerland</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Basel, 14th - On November 15, 1929, Alexandria, Egypt Customs seized twenty boxes of heroin disguised as hide glue aboard the Italian ship Esperia. A thorough investigation revealed a global network of drug trafficking, with branches in almost all countries in Central Europe and the East. Major cities around the world were indirectly involved. The drugs were manufactured in Basel, Switzerland, with centers for distribution in Tokyo, Japan, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The main manufacturer was a German chemist named Muller residing in Basel, along with several collaborators. An Englishman named Conn maintained an organization in Egypt, and a German named Smith managed sales in the Far East. It was discovered that Muller had manufactured drugs worth over 600,000 British pounds. The case is considered to be the most sensational in the history of drug prohibition. It is scheduled to open here on Monday. The League of Nations has sent observers.</p>
<p>Havas, Xiongcheng (Bern), 15th - On Monday, the Badabong Court will hear the narcotics trafficking case, which involves people from several countries. According to Swiss federal law, only persons authorized by the government can manufacture or sell narcotics. There are a total of fifty defendants in this case, thirteen of whom have not been extradited or have escaped, and seven of whom are foreigners. Only seven can be brought to justice; the remainder have insufficient evidence against them. The chief culprit is a German doctor named Muller, whose laboratory manufactured cocaine and heroin, which he shipped to Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy, Egypt, Japan, and Argentina. The doctor, who had a license from the Federal Government, admitted that he had delivered narcotics to unauthorized persons. Among the defendants not apprehended are one Egyptian and one Englishman, who specialized in sales in France, and two Frenchmen and one Pole, who specialized in sales in Austria. There are also one Italian, one from Hamburg, and one Romanian.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Crisis Not Over</h3>
<p>Talk of Demarcating a Buffer Zone Unlikely to Materialize</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Joint Search for Plainclothes Soldiers Also Encounters Obstacles</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication, Evening of the 11th. After the plainclothes soldiers in the Japanese Concession failed to cause further disturbances in the Chinese territory, the situation on the 12th showed a slight easing. The general public speculated that peace might be restored in a day or two. However, the reality is that the situation remains tense beneath the surface. The Japanese troops have continued their intensive activities in the past two days. Sandbags piled up everywhere in the concession have been gradually rebuilt into permanent fortifications. The British and French concessions have also connected their power grids to implement joint defense. The United States, which has no concession in Tianjin, also dispatched a unit of American soldiers yesterday morning to defend a special district to protect foreign merchants. Yesterday afternoon, trenches were dug near Haihe River in the Dayingmen area. These arrangements indicate that it is unlikely that peace will be restored in a day or two. According to investigations, at 10:00 AM on the 11th, representatives of Chinese and Western gentry and merchants met at the Bankers' Association to propose that a 300-meter-wide buffer zone be established at the Sino-Japanese border, to be garrisoned by troops from Britain, the United States, France, and Italy. This would isolate the plainclothes soldiers from the Japanese Concession and deprive them of their base, facilitating an early resolution. The Chinese side indicated that as long as the friendly nations agreed, the provincial and municipal authorities of China would certainly agree. The representatives then visited the German Consul, who requested a written notification for documentation. The representatives then formally sent a letter to the German Consul (because the German Consul is the senior consul of the Tianjin Consular Corps), stating their intention and requesting that all consuls work together to make it happen. Upon hearing this news, the Japanese Consul felt uneasy, believing that if a buffer zone were established and garrisoned by British and American troops, it would be extremely embarrassing for Japan. Therefore, he contacted the municipal authorities and offered to organize a Sino-Japanese inspection team to inspect both the Chinese and Japanese territories for hidden plainclothes soldiers. The municipal authorities also agreed to this proposal. However, the Japanese side used diplomatic tactics to prevent the buffer zone plan from being realized. Yesterday, the attitude of the British and American consuls suddenly became cold. The German Consul even stated, "The problems between China and Japan are best resolved by China and Japan themselves. If there is a real need for various countries to send troops to organize a buffer zone, it is best for the Chinese authorities to make the request, which would be more formal and effective." The implication was that he did not support the representatives' proposal. On the other hand, the Sino-Japanese team to organize inspections was supposed to begin yesterday, but the Japanese Consul suddenly changed his mind, saying, "We can only jointly inspect the Chinese territory within 300 meters outside the Japanese Concession, but we cannot inspect the Japanese Concession. This consul firmly believes that there are no plainclothes soldiers in the Japanese Concession, so there is no need to inspect it." Therefore, the Sino-Japanese joint organization to inspect plainclothes soldiers encountered further obstacles. It is common for the Japanese side to be capricious and disregard good faith. However, this point alone shows that the future is full of thorns, and it will not be easy to eliminate the plainclothes soldiers.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Japanese Consul visited Mayor Zhang of the Special District again. The Japanese Consul verbally promised that Japanese soldiers would not fire guns tonight (the night of the 12th). As expected, from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM, there was peace and quiet. Unexpectedly, gunshots resumed after 11:00 PM, about one or two shots per minute. At 12:00 AM, it was quiet again. At 1:30 AM this morning, gunshots resumed, sometimes dense and sometimes sparse. At 2:30 AM, there were two cannon shots and several machine gun bursts, all originating from the Haiguang Temple area. It was quiet at 3:00 AM, and gunshots resumed at 4:00 AM, becoming more intense at 4:30 AM, and stopped at dawn. However, it was milder than the nights of the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Wu Ou, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a meeting of various sectors at the Bankers' Association to discuss the issue of relief for citizens. More than 50 people attended. There were no temporary solutions for poor people who could not go out to work. The first step was to rescue women and children from danger. The following was immediately decided: (1) Please ask the Red Cross Society and the Red Swastika Society to use cars to pick up women and children from danger. Those who have relatives and friends to go to will be sent to their relatives and friends. Those who have no relatives and friends to go to will be sent to the old Taoist temple outside the new railway station for accommodation, and the Martial Law Headquarters will issue passes. (2) Relief funds will be raised by the representatives attending the meeting. Before the funds are raised, a temporary loan will be taken from the flood relief fund, which will be repaid by the relief society in the future. (3) Chen Baoquan and Yan Zhiyi were jointly elected to meet Chairman Wang, and Deng Qinglan and Liu Mengyang were elected to meet Mayor Zhang, requesting them to quickly contact the consuls to demarcate a buffer zone between China and Japan. (4) Extend the time for citizens to purchase food from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. (5) Send police to protect the water plant and the power plant. At present, the various shops in the Chinese territory are still closed, and the prices of food and fuel have soared several times, and the supply is insufficient, making it extremely difficult. Dongma Road and Yingye Street, the two post offices, are also unable to operate. In the British, French, and Italian concessions, and in Special Districts 1, 2, and 3, the prices of food and fuel have also skyrocketed due to the scarcity of supplies. Beef, mutton, and pork are almost impossible to buy. On the 11th, the Japanese police station in the Japanese Concession briefly opened Suma Street to allow residents to escape, but it was blocked by the French Bureau of Public Works due to overcrowding. Now, 70% to 80% of the residents are running out of food. The Japanese side closed the main water gate at noon the day before yesterday, but opened it yesterday afternoon. The telephone service in the concession was also cut off yesterday. The Joint Relief Association has not yet come up with a rescue plan. (Noon on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Forcibly Seize Fuxian Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Beiping Communication. On the 2nd of this month, the Northeast Mining Company's coal mine in Fuzhou Bay, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, which is run by merchants, was forcibly occupied by more than 40 soldiers dispatched by the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, carrying machine guns and cannons. The mine manager, Wang Yichen, was expelled, and the other employees were not allowed to leave the mine. At the same time, Iwamoto Motozo of Mantetsu was appointed as the mine manager, and six Japanese advisors were sent to monitor each department. The mine was formed by Liaoning merchants raising shares and bank investments, with a value of more than 3 million yuan. It produces about 250,000 tons of anthracite coal annually, which is sold to Japan and the Yangtze River area of China. For more than ten years, it has been operated purely by Chinese people, with painstaking management, and has not been invaded by foreign capital. It has long been coveted by the Japanese, and now it has been forcibly seized by the Japanese army. (12th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Finances Reveal Major Flaws</h3>
<p>Raising Debt and Increasing Taxes</p>
<p>Tokyo Communication. Japan's determination to invade our Northeast by force this time, the expenditure of a large amount of military expenses, how it will affect its finances and society in the future, is still unpredictable. Let's just study the current economic situation, and it is enough to get a glimpse of it.</p>
<p>1. The turbulent waves of the world's economic recession in recent years, the shakeup of the German financial world, and the suspension of the British gold standard have followed one after another. Recently, Japan also discovered a major flaw in its finances in the compilation of the budget for the next fiscal year (Showa 7). According to the report of Finance Minister Inoue to Foreign Minister Shidehara, "The impact of the suspension of the British gold standard has been felt, and Japan's revenue for the next fiscal year will be greatly reduced..." Indeed, the changes in British finances are sufficient to affect Japan's shortcomings in international lending. However, in such a depressed year, the decline of Japan's domestic industry and commerce, the increasing number of unemployed, the deterioration of trade with China, etc., have also been sufficient to affect the sharp reduction of Japan's future revenue. The abolition of the British gold standard is just a stronger stimulus. Recently, when the Japanese Ministry of Finance started to compile the budget for the next fiscal year, observing the insufficient revenue in this year's final accounts, and considering the deterioration of the future situation, the budget estimates that the revenue for the next year will be reduced by about 130 million yuan.</p>
<p>2. This revenue shortfall of 130 million yen accounts for about one-fifteenth (6.6%) of the regular amount of accounting income in Japan in the past years. It is indeed an alarming number. At the same time, it has encountered great difficulties in the compilation of the budget for the next fiscal year. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Finance Ministry tried its best to reorganize its finances and planned to save 100 million yen under the established budget to make up for this deficit. The Finance Minister worked hard and asked for some understanding from all parties. However, the gatherings of cabinet ministers from both parties on the 31st of last month and the 1st of this month refused to reduce the budget suddenly, and the Army and Navy provinces were particularly tough, arguing endlessly. As a result, at most, only about 70 million yen can be expected to be saved in the established budget for the next fiscal year. The Finance Minister's good dream of saving 100 million yen has vanished.</p>
<p>Forced by the situation, the authorities decided to use the two methods of "raising debt" and "increasing taxes" to make up for the remaining 60 million yen of insufficient revenue. Because of the use of the "raising debt" method, a public debt interest of 5 million yen must be added to the shortfall of 60 million yen. In addition, when adding the 5 million yen of financial resources required for the new requirements next year, the total amount of insufficient financial resources will reach 70 million yen.</p>
<p>3. The authorities have decided to issue 30 million yen in public debt and increase tax revenue by 40 million yen to fill the gap of 70 million yen in insufficient financial resources. Regarding the issuance of public debt, the Ministry of Finance will probably raise it under the name of "business public debt", stipulating that the issuance amount is 40 million yen, and it is expected that the net financial resources amount can reach 30 million yen.</p>
<p>As for the increase of 40 million yen in tax revenue, the authorities have decided to adopt a capital-heavy taxation policy. Although the specific plan has not yet been formally decided, it is roughly (1) increasing the liquor tax, (2) reducing the inheritance tax exemption point and increasing the tax rate, (3) increasing the capital interest tax rate, and (4) reducing the personal income tax exemption point. If it is still insufficient, the methods of increasing the price of tobacco, increasing the price of postcards, and increasing the price of stamps will be used to fill the gap. According to this taxation policy, it is harmful to the rich and does not benefit the poor. As a result, both the poor and the rich will perish.</p>
<p>4. Raising debt and increasing taxes have become a major issue in the compilation of Japan's budget proposal for the next year. Since the formation of the Minseito cabinet, it has been marked by "non-debt raising" and "reducing the burden on the people." However, the decision of this contradictory policy seems to have exposed its own internal unsoundness. Even if we acknowledge the "extraordinary measures must be used in extraordinary times" mentioned in the second cabinet meeting (the 1st of this month) as an appropriate explanation, it is enough to show the failure of the Minseito politics. The Minseito has implemented austerity policies for two or three years, but the result is still only winning a deficit. Therefore, the responsibility for encountering "extraordinary times" today must still be borne by the Minseito, and it cannot be concealed by "extraordinary measures." In short, the adoption of the "raising debt" and "increasing taxes" measures this time has automatically shattered half of the golden signboard of the Minseito and given the opposition party an opportunity to take advantage of it.

<h3>Japanese Consul in Shantou Raises Unreasonable Protest Again</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Sternly Refuted It</p>
<p>Shantou Communication. Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, the people of Chaoshan have been agitated, and all sectors have unanimously launched a national salvation and anti-Japanese movement. The Japanese living in Shantou have also repeatedly tried to provoke trouble. The Japanese Consul, Kokene, has repeatedly raised unreasonable protests to the municipal government over minor matters, and even tried to suppress the patriotic movements of our people and the posting of slogans. Yesterday, the Consul again used the excuse that the naval officers of his country were stoned by Chinese people and sent a letter to the municipal government to protest, and there were words such as "if this causes a defensive confrontation, this office will not be responsible," with the intention of intimidation. Today, Mayor Huang has sternly refuted it, and urged him to pay attention to the obligations he should bear under the "Sino-French Tianjin Treaty." The reply letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"In reply, your letter of the 2nd of this month states that at 2:00 PM on October 30th, two or three naval officers of your country took a boat back to the ship in front of the customs, and suddenly Chinese people on the shore threw stones at the boat. This kind of behavior, if it causes a defensive confrontation, this office will not be responsible. I hope that all military and police agencies will be notified to strictly prohibit it. After the occurrence of the East Three Provinces incident, the people of this city, although deeply pained by the current disaster, are able to recognize that the laws should be strictly observed when carrying out patriotic movements, and none of them do not adhere to peace, and strictly observe order to maintain civilization. There will never be such a thing as the so-called 'unconscious actions' in your letter. As the mayor, I have the responsibility for the local area, and I have always paid close attention to the protection of foreigners. The facts are there, and they are known to your consul and to the enlightened people of all countries stationed in Shantou. However, your consul has repeatedly sent letters and negotiated with me again and again, and there are still many protests that are seemingly right but actually wrong. One says 'immediately notify the navy of your country to send troops to protect', and the other says 'cause a defensive confrontation'. Even for the necessary and legitimate inspections carried out by the local military and police during martial law to protect safety, you also want to send troops to land and stop them. In the midst of the agitated emotions of the people of this city, if I, as the mayor, had not properly explained and handled the situation, it would have been most likely to arouse the anger of the people. The general meaning of this has been conveyed in my letters again and again, and I have asked your consul to pay attention to it, and stated that these unfounded protests that hinder friendship and peace are not the expressions that should be made in accordance with the 'spirit of international friendship' and 'taking care of friendship'. However, this government is still receiving this letter from your consul, and I think it is because your consul has only relied on one-sided reports and has not examined them carefully. Also, this government previously sent a letter to your office requesting that when your country's warships arrive in Shantou, you must notify us two days in advance of the date of entry and the time of berthing, and the reason for the arrival of the ship, in order to avoid misunderstandings. Later, we received your reply letter on August 12, which stated that your country's warships come to Shantou in accordance with Article 29 of the Sino-French Tianjin Treaty and are not subject to any restrictions. This government has always valued treaties and trust, so I, as the mayor, do not object to the entry and exit of your country's warships into and out of the port of Shantou, if it is not related to international practices and the martial law regulations of this city. However, according to Article 29 of the Sino-French Treaty on which your consul is based, 'France is allowed to dispatch warships to berth in the various trading ports in China, so that the consuls may have authority, and in the future, the personnel of the warships shall be bound and shall not cause trouble.' Also, according to Article 33 of the original treaty on the restraint of sailors landing, 'Sailors landing must comply with the rules of restraint, and the rules to be followed shall be negotiated by the consular officials and notified to the local officials for investigation, in order to prevent the sailors from causing disputes with the people of the interior.' Therefore, the arrival of your country's warships in Shantou is in accordance with Article 29 of the Sino-French Tianjin Treaty, and you should abide by Articles 29 and 33 of the treaty to restrain the personnel of the warships and avoid causing disputes with the local people. Now, it is found that your consul has long enjoyed the rights of the treaty, but it seems that you have not paid attention to the obligations of the treaty. Recently, you have repeatedly planned to send sailors ashore, seemingly wanting to cause disputes with the people of this city, which is a great loss of the spirit of harmony. I, as the mayor, am deeply saddened by this. I, as the mayor, am now motivated by the desire to maintain order and peace in this city, and to continue to increase the sincerity of harmony between the people of our two countries, and encouraged by the spirit and enthusiasm of respecting international treaties. I hereby express my sincere hope that your consul will pay attention to Articles 29 and 33 of the above-mentioned Tianjin Treaty. As for the lives and property of your country's expatriates residing under the rule of this government, they have been protected thoroughly by the local military and police and are already safe. I, as the mayor, am grateful for the sincerity of 'preserving the spirit of international friendship', and I hope that your consul will pay attention to these protests that hinder friendship in the future. It is hoped."</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Strictly Consolidates Security</h3>
<p>Provincial Capital Guarded by Lei Brigade</p>
<p>Jinan Communication. Since the Japanese disturbed Tianjin, Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province, was deeply afraid that unruly elements would take the opportunity to take unexpected actions. He ordered the troops and police stationed in the coastal ports and along the Jiaoji Railway to strictly guard against them. Jinan, as the location of the provincial capital, is a mixed area of Chinese and foreigners and is particularly important. The arrangement is also very meticulous. The responsibility for guarding is borne by the Lei Taiping unit of the pistol brigade, and the police of the thirteen branch offices of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau are responsible for assisting. All the guns used by the police in the branch offices that are dilapidated and unusable have been replaced with new guns today. Han recently spoke to the press, saying that the Tianjin Incident is currently being handled for the aftermath. The outside world says that Shi Hanzhang and Li Fangchen also participated in it, which is absolutely untrue. If they are not coerced, how can they do this? The security of this province is definitely worry-free, and the deployment has already been completed. If an accident occurs at 12:00 at night, it can be completely eliminated by 7:00 the next morning. I am confident that I have this certainty. Qingdao is a special city, according to the Washington Treaty, all countries must not station troops and cannot station troops, so there is no armed assistance, and I think nothing unexpected will happen. Although the Liu Guitang bandit unit has not yet been wiped out at this time, the bandits are only taking advantage of two or three hundred people and are unable to do anything. The provincial government does not have any plans to recruit the bandits. (13th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Establishes Exit Points for Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication. The Anhui Provincial Government, after the floods, because the people lacked grain reserves, in order to maintain the people's food and stabilize the people's hearts, had banned the export of rice and grain from the province. However, the counties within the province were allowed to circulate as usual. After the flood subsided slightly, Shucheng, Sanhe, Nanling, and other counties that were less affected still had surplus rice for export, so someone petitioned the authorities to establish a special agency to manage the export of rice and grain, and to levy export rice donations to help with disaster relief. Subsequently, the provincial government commissioned Yang Yizhai, the former director of the rice donation bureau, to start by investigating the rice storage in the entire province. As a result, it was considered that a small amount of rice could be exported, so it was decided to establish the "Anhui Rice and Grain Export Inspection and Prohibition Office", which implied levying taxes in the prohibition. Yang Yizhai was appointed as the director of the general office. The general office is located in Wuhu, and Wuhu port is the general hub for gathering and exporting rice. It is specially stipulated that the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce and the County Disaster Relief Committee are responsible for assisting. Other places such as Heshang Port in Dangtu County, Yuxikou in He County, and Dingbu in Langxi County are all places that sailboats must pass through, and inspection and prohibition committees are set up separately. Yang has already received 2,000 yuan from the province as start-up expenses to come to Wuhu and is actively preparing to set it up. It can be established within a few days. The following is an excerpt of the measures: (Article 1) The purpose of these measures is to prohibit the export of rice and grain according to provincial orders, and to relieve the people's food in the disaster area. (Article 2) Rice and grain inspection and prohibition committees shall be established in Heshang Port in Dangtu County, Yuxikou in He County, and Dingbu in Langxi County in this province. (Article 3) The above-mentioned inspection and prohibition committees shall be organized by three people jointly recommended by the Shanghai-based and Beijing-based Anhui Flood Relief Associations and three people sent by the Provincial Relief Association, and stationed in the above-mentioned places to strictly enforce the prohibition. The Inspection and Prohibition Committee may, when necessary, submit a report to the Provincial Relief Association and invite fair and just gentry from the area to assist in handling the matter. (Article 4) The export of rice and grain from this province shall be centered on the port of Wuhu. The Chamber of Commerce and the County Relief Committee in the port should be responsible for the prohibition, and the Provincial Relief Association and the Inspection and Prohibition Committee should review it at any time. No matter whether it is transportation by sail or other means, it is prohibited. (Article 5) During the prohibition period, the Provincial Relief Association shall submit a report to the Provincial Government, ordering the county governments and legal entities to do their best to assist and protect them. (Article 6) The office expenses shall be prepared by the Provincial Relief Association and submitted to the Provincial Government for allocation. (Article 7) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Provincial Government for record, and shall be reported to the Central Relief Association for record. If there are any matters that are not covered, the Provincial Relief Association may consult with the Shanghai-based and Beijing-based Anhui Relief Associations and amend them at any time. (14th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick Mail</h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government recently created a business tax on seven items: bamboo, wood, tea, ramie, silk, cocoons, and eggs, with an annual tax amount of 500,000 yuan. The Finance Department has appointed Yang Yuyu as the director-general, and Yang has come to Wuhu to organize and establish it. Ding Chonglian has been appointed as the director of the Wuhu branch. Branch offices will be set up in the counties one after another.</p>
<p>The Wuhu merchants, because of the depression in all industries after the floods, were unable to bear the business tax and requested a postponement of the tax. Later, people were sent by the Business Tax Collection Office to demand payment and arrested the managers of Hongdasheng and other companies, which almost led to a strike. Yesterday, the County Chamber of Commerce held a meeting and resolved to recommend the chairman, Wu Xingzhou, and the standing committee members, Cui Lianggong and Li Dachu, to go to the province and strive for 25% relief from the Finance Department.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Anti-Japanese Association previously discovered that committee members Zou Xirong and others had accepted bribes and released Japanese goods and cloths to Hefei. The case has not yet been concluded. Recently, the Party Headquarters ordered the reorganization of the association, which will be composed of three workers' organizations, three chambers of commerce, and five students. Today, the election results were: workers Zou Xirong, Wu Ya, and Xu Jichun were elected; chambers of commerce members Zhou Naiqi, Wang Zhufu, and Shu Yuanbang were elected; students Yang Guohua, Tao Guixian, Zhan Yiya, Wang Xinsheng, and Zhang Changming were elected. Also, the schools have scheduled to hold a national disaster conference on the 16th, with a three-minute silence and speeches on the Japanese soldiers forcibly occupying the eastern provinces.

<p>Local Communication</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Arrives in Suzhou for Garrison Duty. The division headquarters of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army, and the entire 6th Regiment and one battalion of the 4th Regiment, arrived in Suzhou yesterday (the 15th) morning at 9:00 AM. The division headquarters was stationed in the Liuyuan Garden, and the directly subordinate units were stationed nearby. The entire 6th Regiment is now entering the city, and the regimental headquarters is stationed in the Lingjiu Temple in Xieyaqian.

There are still the 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 4th Regiment and the brigade headquarters of the 120th Brigade, which are scheduled to arrive in Beijing around 11:00 PM tonight. Except for the brigade headquarters stationed inside and outside the city, the 4th Regiment is stationed outside the city according to the planned plan.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Tangdongli Village. The home of Gu Qunrui in Tangdongli Village, 12 li away from Guoxiang, was suddenly robbed by more than a dozen bandits at 1:00 AM yesterday (the 15th), and more than 600 yuan was stolen.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>People Request Instructions on the Issue of Grain Levies on Barren Land. This county suffered a drought this year, and the county reported on the quality of the autumn survey, and the statistics for cotton and rice were 66%. It has been approved by the provincial government. However, the community is deeply dissatisfied with the county's handling of the autumn harvest. In the past, the county had to convene meetings of local autonomous personnel and local fair and just gentry to discuss the autumn harvest before reporting it. Recently, this procedure has not been followed, so that the fields that have not yielded any grain this year, totaling more than 30,000 mu, still have to be used as cultivated land for grain levies. If the authorities must handle it, then the landowners will apply to the county government to recover rent in the future, forcing the tenants to pay compensation. Does the government have a solution? Someone applied to the provincial government for instructions.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Factory's Entire Board of Directors and Supervisors Suddenly Resign</p>
<p>Tao Shensheng, Director of the Wuxi Silk Factory Workers' Union, Shen Jusheng, Supervisor, and others, in view of the fact that since being elected as directors and supervisors in this reshuffle, they originally intended to work together wholeheartedly to seek the welfare of all workers. However, not long after taking office, numerous disagreements arose. First, there was the dispute over commemorative wages, followed by the sudden rise of an audit storm. Former Director Zhu Zu, Zhang, almost faced unemployment due to advocating the return of commemorative wages. Gong Qingcheng, the current standing supervisor, was resented for strongly advocating the investigation of accounts. Initially, he was humiliated at the representative assembly, and then accused by seventeen private individuals in a joint letter. On Dongmen Road, gangsters threatened to treat him with axes. Under the Heming Tower, they openly planned to throw Qingcheng into the river. Qingcheng eventually suffered a sudden death. Everyone who heard of it was frightened. Therefore, Wang Shihe, Chairman of the Economic Review Committee, Tao Shensheng, and others, jointly submitted a letter to the county party headquarters yesterday, requesting permission to resign in order to preserve their lives.</p>
<p>Captured Lake Bandits Escorted to Suzhou for Interrogation</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, over two hundred lake bandits were discovered on Maji Mountain in Taihu Lake, at the intersection of Wuxi and Changzhou. Subsequently, the local defense corps, the Xueyanqiao defense corps, and the water police led teams to suppress them, and the lake bandits were repelled. Two lake bandits, Li Jiaxiang and Hu Er, seven boatmen, and two rescued hostages, Zou Amao and Chen Genyuan, were captured. The next day, they were all escorted to the 10th team of the Wujin water police for interrogation. Yesterday (the 15th) at 10:00 AM, team leader Li Guozhen sent police to escort them to the second district headquarters in Wuxi. At 4:00 PM, the second district headquarters ordered patrol officer Xiong Bin to lead four police officers to escort the eleven people, including the lake bandits, boatmen, and hostages, to the third district headquarters in Suzhou to await verification. Since the lake bandits on Maji Mountain were repelled by the police and defense corps, rumors have been rampant for days. Zhai Fangshan, the tenth district chief, telegraphed the second water police district, requesting that police be stationed for defense. Upon receiving the report, District Chief Shen ordered the tenth team stationed in Changzhou to go and be stationed there in order to quell the rumors.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Qianhua Student Missing</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the morning of the 11th, a villager came to the Qianhua Middle School affiliated Huacheng Primary School in Xiguanbao Lane, Wuyi, claiming to a boarding student that "Your aunt's house outside Dabeimen is celebrating her birthday today. Go quickly and buy a new robe and bring it to you." The student believed it to be true and went happily. Until recently, the student has not returned to school. Principal Tie Zhijian immediately sent someone to inquire at his aunt's house, and was told that there was no such thing. Only then did they realize that the student had been deceived. The school has notified his family and is conducting investigations in all directions. The student is fifteen years old and lives in Kuailieshan, at the intersection of Wucheng. It is feared that he was kidnapped by bandits.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Firearms Found in Empty Coffin</p>
<p>A defense force is stationed in the Wu Ancestral Hall in Shitougang Wu Village, in the western countryside of the county. There was a coffin for longevity of the Wu family stored in the ancestral hall, which was originally empty. Suddenly, a strange odor was emitted. The garrison opened the coffin for inspection, and found a rifle and two pistols hidden inside. The numbers on the guns were for the local residents' self-defense, which had been lost to bandits. The Yang family who managed the ancestral hall was arrested and sent to the county government for interrogation. The detective team of the Provincial Public Security Bureau previously solved a bandit case, which revealed that the Hua family in the village had been storing three guns for the bandits. An investigation was initiated but the case was not solved. It is believed to be related to this case and is now under strict investigation.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Requests Prevention of Mercury Transport to Japan</p>
<p>The Provincial People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association recently received a letter from the Wuhan Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, reporting that unscrupulous merchants were buying mercury on behalf of the Japanese and transporting it to Japan to manufacture lethal weapons, requesting investigation and prevention. After sending personnel to investigate and confirming the facts, the association specifically sent a letter to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce yesterday, notifying all businesses to uniformly prevent smuggling.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>County Government Executes Two Bandits</p>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau arrested bandits Song Chaowu and Yan Deliang, who robbed the Yuanxing store in the Xinshi market south of the city, as well as Gu Kui and Chi Yushan, who harbored the bandits. They were sent to the county government, and after interrogation by the Pacification Military Tribunal, Song and Yan were sentenced to death, and Gu was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, and Chi to five years in prison.

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Prohibiting Export of Rice and Grain</p>
<p>The Xiaoshan County Government believes that the rice produced in the county is not enough for the entire county to eat, and this year's harvest has been greatly reduced. If the export of rice and grain is not prohibited early, the future of the people's food will be greatly affected. In addition to prohibiting it at all ports along the river, all rice and grain transported to Shaoxing must first be reported and approved by the nearest agency before it can be transported.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Major Fire on Rixin Street</p>
<p>Rixin Street in the city of Yongbo is a prosperous area, where major bookstores are located. At about 7:00 PM last night, the wiring in the manager's office of the Xin Xue Hui She Bookstore suddenly exploded, and sparks flew up in an instant, bursting through the roof and spreading violently. It took two hours to extinguish the fire. After investigation, it was estimated that four front and rear buildings of the Xin Xue Hui She Bookstore, as well as books, were burned, resulting in a loss of over 15,000 yuan. Two front buildings (two downstairs rooms were demolished) and two rear buildings of the Wenming Xue She were burned, resulting in a loss of over 15,000 yuan.

<h3>Telegraphic Urging of the Government to Send Troops to Aid Heilongjiang</h3>
<p>The Party Protection Comrades Association and Other Groups Telegraph the Government</p>
<p>The China Kuomintang Party Protection Comrades Association and other four groups telegraphed: Commander-in-Chief Chiang of Nanjing, Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping, Commander-in-Chief Chen and Commander-in-Chief Li, Deputy Commander Bai of Guangzhou, Mr. Yan Baichuan of Taiyuan, Mr. Feng Huanzhang, and all the generals and armed comrades of the country are hereby informed that today is the last day for the League of Nations to order the Japanese army to withdraw from our Northeast, and the day our government prepares to take over the lost territory in the Northeast. Looking north with anticipation, the reality is hard to see. Japanese reports state that the upper and lower levels are determined to reject the intervention of third countries, and insist on maintaining the vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia in this incident. They will risk the disapproval of the world, mobilize a large army to enter our mainland, and advocate the joint management of China, inciting the international community. Our country's recent diplomacy has failed again. To seek life in death, the only way is war. Speed is essential in military affairs, and it is impossible to delay any longer. It is rumored that the various armies have not yet been mobilized, and the government is particularly secretive about the defensive measures. In recent days, telegrams have reported that General Ma Zhanshan of Nenjiang has reported victories, and the lone army is fighting hard, but reinforcements have not been sent. The Northeast is China's Northeast, and the country is China's country. With great disaster looming, expelling the invaders is the priority. The pain of one corner concerns the overall situation. Any further mistakes will lead to mutual destruction. The great expulsions of barbarians in the Spring and Autumn period, and Confucius' lament for the injured child Wang Qi, were about irreconcilable hatred that everyone had the right to punish. If we continue to hold onto the view of this boundary and that boundary, or even deceive each other and watch each other, this is a path to suicide. Anyone with a conscience would not willingly sink into this. We beg you to immediately adopt the most effective and decisive measures against Japan. No matter which side, only strength matters. Unite and mobilize, with the order of priority determined by the distance and urgency. We have more people than they do, and victory is certain. Even if we are unfortunate, sacrificing for justice, being able to fight and defend, then we can negotiate. Compared to surrendering without resistance and accepting a treaty under the city walls, we can retain a considerable position in the international arena. Today, the fate of our country rests on you. One thought to fight leads to many paths to life; not fighting leads to many paths to death. We and others cannot bear to become slaves of a conquered country. Seeing the enemy army coming to empty the country, we would rather lead the people to the East China Sea to die. While there is still breath, we cannot remain silent. With extreme grief, we cry out, hoping for your consideration.

<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association Telegraphed the Nanjing National Government</p>
<p>We respectfully inform you that since the Japanese invaders occupied Liaoning and Jilin, they have increased their troops and attacked Heilongjiang with increasing urgency. Fortunately, Chairman Ma is loyal and patriotic, and encourages his soldiers, repeatedly defeating the powerful invaders. The Liaodong Peninsula is preserved. However, the suffering border province is facing the strength of one country of the violent Japanese, and the fierce battle has been long and tiring. We are deeply concerned that there may be an accident. At this critical moment of survival, the central government should quickly respond. The Japanese army is openly approaching the situation, which is already clear to the world. Our country's resistance will be supported by international justice. Therefore, we urgently telegraph this to you, humbly requesting you to quickly gather the main forces and send reinforcements to the border to uphold our justice and recover our lost land. Do not panic and hesitate, making repeated mistakes. We have previously read the government's letter to the people, stating that it is the government's fault if it can fight but does not fight. Now, Chairman Ma can lead a small force to defeat the Japanese army, which is twice its size, indicating that our country's army is not unable to fight, but is afraid to fight. If we are afraid to fight, the country will perish. Even if the people want to question the government, it will be impossible to do so. Therefore, we dare not avoid the axe and humbly express our tears and responsibilities before the country perishes. Please consider and accept this. All-Zhejiang Public Association. Deleted.</p>

<p>Public Groups Remit Funds for Assistance</p>
<p>Various local public groups, acting as agents for Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, who has bravely fought the enemy and made meritorious service, sent telegrams of condolence and remitted 10,000 yuan in cash through the Bank of China to provide assistance. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: "Respected Acting Chairman Ma of Qiqihar, the lone army in the remote frontier has bravely fought the enemy, regaining national dignity and awakening the loyal souls of the people. Hearing your righteous voice, we are overjoyed and moved to tears. We will first remit 10,000 yuan in national currency through the Bank of China to boost the morale of the three armies, and will continue to provide assistance to strengthen your support. We wish you continued struggle and final victory.

<p>The Life Society Raises Funds to Aid the Army</p>
<p>The Life Weekly Society believes that General Ma Zhanshan led his patriotic soldiers to bravely resist the enemy, fighting desperately for a glimmer of hope for the nation, and the whole country is moved and the people are inspired. However, the lone army is far away and there is a danger of running out of supplies. Sending troops to assist is the responsibility of the government, and sincerely helping the army is the duty of the people. The society has launched a fundraising campaign to provide assistance, starting with a donation of 100 yuan from itself. It has also received enthusiastic support from the Sanyou Industrial Company, the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and some colleagues from the Bank of China, with a total donation of 1,685 yuan. Yesterday, it continued to receive one month's salary donations from the colleagues of Xie Hengqing, the Tianchu MSG Factory, the Tianyuan Chemical Factory, the Chichang New Company, the Shanghai Bookstore, Shen Chengxiang Chunji Paper Store and its colleagues, the colleagues of the second branch of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, the colleagues of the Aihua Pharmaceutical Company, ten employees of the Yuan Yi Sugar Store, the students of the Minsheng Chicken Farm, and enthusiastic comrades such as the students of the Shanghai National Medical College, with a total donation of 2,278 yuan and one dime. The two sums together total 3,953 yuan and one dime. The China Communications Bank has first telegraphed 4,000 yuan to General Ma for his personal receipt. It is hoped that compatriots will generously donate to overcome the national crisis. All the titles of the donors will be published in the newspaper as soon as possible, in addition to being published in the Life Weekly, in order to awaken the dying national spirit. The original telegram from the society to General Ma is as follows: "General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, your valiant resistance against the enemy is righteous and commendable, and the whole country is moved and the people are inspired. We are concerned about the lone army being far away and our hearts are pounding. Sending troops to assist is the responsibility of the government, and sincerely helping the army is the duty of the people. Our society has launched a fundraising campaign to provide some assistance to the military. In addition to publishing the titles of the donors in our journal and in Shanghai newspapers, we have first telegraphed 4,000 yuan through the China Communications Bank, and we will continue to remit more as we receive more donations.

<p>The Tianchu Factory Donates Military Funds</p>
<p>The owner of the Tianchu MSG Factory in this city donated 1,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Life Weekly Society for remittance to犒军 the troops. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Chairman Ma: "Respected Acting Chairman General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, the violent Japanese are acting recklessly, and the whole country is outraged. General, you have defended the country with your lone army, enhancing the character of the nation, which is admirable. We respectfully remit 1,000 yuan in national currency through the bank to犒军 your officers and soldiers. We hope that you will accept it with pleasure. The Shanghai Tianchu MSG Factory."</p>
<p>The Minnan Fellow Townsmen Telegraph a Two-Point Message</p>
<p>The Minnan Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association held a standing committee meeting yesterday and decided to telegraph to overseas Minnan compatriots and the various regions of Xing, Quan, Yong, Ting, Zhang, and Long, requesting donations to慰劳 General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province. It also sent a flying telegram to General Ma, expressing its respect. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (Telegram 1) "To overseas Minnan compatriots and the compatriots of Xing, Quan, Yong, Ting, Zhang, and Long: The Japanese bandits are acting violently and occupying our Liaoning and Jilin. All those with human hearts cannot but be filled with pain and anger. Our Minnan and Taiwan are like lips and teeth. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold, and the disaster is even more pressing. At this time of national crisis, we should rise up and fight. But fighting must have facts, and should not be based on empty words. The rich should donate funds, and the poor should contribute their efforts. For example, Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang has fought hard with his lone army, repeatedly defeating the Japanese invaders. The national soul has been revived and the people's spirit has been boosted. He is the one we should all support and make a strong backing for. In recent years, the people of our country have made mistakes in their patriotic policies, and have often thrown money into empty shells. From now on, no money should be given to those who cannot fight against foreign aggression, and do not be fooled by those who talk about fighting but do not fight. Everyone should do their best for those who are actually fighting and waiting for support. Alas, the enemy is deep and the country is in danger. If the lone army in Heilongjiang is defeated in one battle, China cannot be saved. Our Minnan elders and brothers have always been known for their righteousness, and will surely be able to慰劳 our association's call. The Minnan Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association. Ham. (Telegram 2) To Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang and all the anti-Japanese soldiers: The Japanese invaders have invaded, and Liaoning and Jilin have been lost. The whole country is heartbroken and the whole world is laughing. It was thought that there was no one in China and that we should sit and wait for death. Fortunately, you have risen up in Heilongjiang and repeatedly defeated the Japanese invaders, washing away the shame since the Jiawu War and showing the example of soldiers in the north and south. The people have no constant affection, but only for those who are virtuous. You and all the soldiers who fight with you are truly the pillars of the country and the parents of the people. In addition to sending telegrams to Minnan compatriots at home and abroad, requesting them to donate money and contribute their efforts to jointly share the same hatred, we hereby send this telegram first to express our admiration. We hope that you will continue to resist the war, wipe out the enemy, and live as a national hero and die as a fierce ghost who kills the enemy, leaving a fragrance for ten thousand years and being worshiped for hundreds of generations. Compared to those who surrender their guns and offer cities, and steal their lives and occupy their positions, you are like a auspicious unicorn compared to an ant. The Minnan Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association. Ham.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Initiate Fundraising</p>
<p>The Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association held its seventh joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees at 3:00 PM yesterday. During the meeting, the issue of aiding the Heilongjiang army in resisting Japan was discussed. The following measures were decided: (1) Request the central government to strictly order the nearest troops in eastern provinces to quickly send troops to assist the Heilongjiang army, and send the air force from the central government to assist in the battle. No concession should be made within the scope of legitimate defense. (2) The association will launch a fundraising campaign to aid the Heilongjiang army's military expenses, and Commissioners Li Xunfu and Li Qingfan will be responsible for carrying it out. The funds should be collected and remitted to Heilongjiang within one day. (3) The association will send a telegram to Ma Zhanshan and the officers and soldiers of the Heilongjiang army, expressing its condolences, and will also telegram Zhang Xueliang to ask why he has not sent troops to assist.

It is estimated that a large sum of money can be obtained in one day today and remitted to Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Will Discuss Today</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association sent a letter to its members yesterday, stating that Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang has embraced the fearless spirit of the president and the unyielding integrity of a man, leading thousands of soldiers to protect half of the country. The good news has been received and we are all moved to tears. However, there is no external support and no internal salary. How can we maintain the precarious situation for a long time? The members are nationals, how can we stand by and watch? It has been decided to convene a temporary meeting at 8:00 PM on the 16th of this month to discuss ways to support Heilongjiang Province.</p>
<p>The Ten-Person Group Remitted 1,000 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Respected Acting Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Harbin, we deeply admire your valiant support with the lone army against the invasion of the violent Japanese. In addition to urgently telegramming the central government and Deputy Commander Zhang to immediately send heavy reinforcements, we have raised 1,000 yuan to provide some military expenses. We hereby telegraph this first. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Ten-Person Group.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday, around 7:00 PM, the committee held a public banquet and a preparatory meeting at the Bank Club. Attending were various provincial water conservancy bureau directors, provincial construction department directors, Chinese and foreign engineers, and members of the relief association, among others. Committee member Zhu Qinglan delivered an important speech during the banquet, which concluded around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Today's General Meeting</p>
<p>The first general meeting will be held today from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM at the Bank Club, No. 4 Hong Kong Road. The second general meeting will be held at the same location from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

<p>Zhu Qinglan's Speech</p>
<p>The Technical Committee of the Disaster Area Work Group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee is holding a preparatory meeting today. It is gratifying to see so many water conservancy technical experts gathered together. However, because the whole country has been flooded, our gathering today is to discuss the repair of damaged embankments and to help our compatriots who are suffering from the disaster. Thinking of the suffering in the disaster areas, we can only have tragic emotions. This year's floods have spread almost all over the country. All the flood prevention facilities that have been built over the centuries have been destroyed, and all of them should be repaired. Empty words cannot solve the problem. Both facts and theory must be taken into account. I would like to discuss three main points with you: (1) Financial resources. This time, we are planning only for the provinces that have been most severely affected by the disaster. The projects already cover a wide area, including the Yangtze River, Huai River, Grand Canal, Han River, Xiang River, Yuan River, Ru River, and Ying River. At this time of national crisis and financial difficulty, the government is doing its best to raise funds, even though it has already ordered 300,000 tons of American wheat to implement work-for-relief. However, the projects are huge and the funds are tight, and it is certain that they will not be enough. We hope that local governments will also raise considerable funds and work with the central government to carry out the projects. (2) Talent. Repairing embankments depends on correcting past defects and preventing future disasters. We must be familiar with the geography, customs, landforms, and mountains and rivers, and we must also have specialized knowledge and experience to be competent. This committee was established in a hurry, and we have to rely on local governments and responsible authorities to use their original personnel to work together. (3) Time. If the embankments that have collapsed in various places are not repaired now, farmers will not be able to plant crops next spring, and the dangers are unimaginable. We cannot wait for the long measurement process to be completed before discussing construction. We hope that the local authorities will direct the technical personnel of this committee to cooperate and handle the matter quickly, striving for agility. According to what has been said, financial resources are so difficult, so when construction is carried out in the future, every penny spent must have the effect of one penny. Wasting one penny is a sin against the victims. We must be as frugal as possible, and we must be as practical as possible, so that the general workers can understand this meaning. In terms of talent, we must pool our efforts and make the best use of everyone's talents. Thinking of the suffering of our compatriots in the disaster areas, we must try our best to start construction as soon as possible and repair the embankments as soon as possible, so that the minds of the people of the country can be stabilized one day earlier. As for all the issues that should be studied during construction, please feel free to bring them up for discussion. I, Qinglan, thank you all in advance on behalf of the victims.</p>
<p>Sacrifices in Disaster Relief</p>
<p>According to a report received yesterday by the local relief association, three people working in the disaster area recently died from old age and accumulation of infectious diseases in the disaster area. They are Cai Fuqing, director of the relief department of the Hubei Disaster Area Flood Relief Association and chairman of the charity association, who died from overwork in the Hubei disaster area at the age of 68; He Shaoqing, executive member of the Hubei Disaster Area Flood Relief Association and director of the Qiaokou Shelter, who died from water poisoning with simultaneous swelling of his legs and abdomen at the age of 58; and Liu Youqing, a member of the Red Cross, who died from infection after burying corpses, less than two hours after becoming ill, age unknown. Yesterday, Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the relief association, wrote a plaque for each of the three men in memory of them. The inscriptions on the three plaques read "Bodhi Attains Fruition," "Sacrificing Life for Righteousness," and "Martyrdom."</p>
<p>American Wheat Has Not Yet Arrived</p>
<p>Regarding the report that the first batch of American wheat shipped from the United States had arrived in Shanghai, and that photos had been published, the National Government Relief Association formally denied this yesterday, saying that the ship carried a total of 7,000 tons of American wheat and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month, but was delayed until tomorrow (the 17th) due to fog en route. The news and photos reported were all a mistake of privately transported wheat flour, it was said.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Committee for Sheltering Flood Victims</h3>
<p>First Contacted the Municipal Government, Then Held a Meeting for Discussion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Sheltering Flood Victims appointed Mr. Huang Hanzhi, Mr. Qu Wenliu, Mr. Lu Bohong, and Mr. Wang Binyan as representatives to contact the municipal government on the morning of the 14th regarding the sheltering of flood victims. Then, at 3:00 PM, they held a meeting at Renji Hall on Six Ma Road to discuss the matter. Attendees included Chen Liangyu, Cheng Yiqing, Huang Hanzhi, Li Zhian, Du Yuesheng, Lu Shaoliu, Xu Junren, Wang Binyan, Qu Wenliu, Wang Peiyuan, Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, Wen Lanting, and Zhang Xiaolin. Xu Junren chaired the meeting, and Xiao Kantong recorded the minutes. Many people spoke at the meeting, generally advocating that the official authorities should still be responsible for handling the matter, but that the committee could provide financial assistance. The following methods were agreed upon: (1) The committee should invite the directors of the Public Security Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Health Bureau to form a joint organization. (2) All matters related to sheltering and repatriation should still be handled by the original administrative agencies. (3) All expenses that need to be used for sheltering and repatriation matters that have been decided and passed by the committee will be raised to the best of its ability. (4) Members of the committee and directors of the flood victim shelters may submit proposals for public discussion. After the meeting, the proposal was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Flood Victim Shelter Administration Office. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "Dear Sir, this afternoon at 3:00 PM, our colleagues held a meeting at Renji Hall on Six Ma Road to discuss the sheltering of flood victims in Shanghai. We all agreed that although this matter is a charity, it is of great importance to local security and should still be handled by the official authorities. The methods decided upon are recorded in the minutes. A copy of the case is hereby submitted for your review and reply. (The rest is omitted)."</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu and Others Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, and Chu Minyi took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>No Need to Worry About the Security of This City</h3>
<p>Joint Defense Between Chinese and Foreign Concessions Has Long Been Implemented</p>
<p>Since the Tianjin Incident, the military and police authorities in this city have received intelligence from various sources that Japanese ronin are plotting riots. To facilitate defense, they have organized a joint military and police office, appointing Wang Shou as director and Wang Zhijing as deputy director, and establishing an intelligence department. The defense of Zhabei is particularly important. All police officers from the municipal public security bureau's various districts and sub-bureaus, all members of the security corps, all police officers from the sixth brigade of the police corps, and all tax police officers stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance are armed and on duty after 8:00 PM every evening, inspecting pedestrians at any time, and stopping only at 6:00 AM the next morning. Temporary curfews will be announced when necessary to prevent incidents. As for the Chinese and foreign concession authorities, they have been responsible for joint defense and have long since negotiated and implemented it. In areas such as North Sichuan Road, where Japanese reside, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department has increased the number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives to patrol day and night. In the event of an incident, the Chinese authorities will be notified immediately so that they can contact each other. The prevention is quite strict, so the security of this city and the safety of citizens can be assured.</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Japanese Youth Corps</h3>
<p>Can the Japanese Consul's Words Be Believed?</p>
<p>The Continental News reported: Yesterday (the 14th), according to the Japanese Consul-General in this city, the purpose of the Japanese Youth Corps organized by Japanese residents in Shanghai is to resist anti-Japanese groups. Its activities will be limited to Wusong Road and other areas where Japanese residents live in Hongkou. Members will not be given firearms. Rumors of a conspiracy to create a similar incident to Tianjin are completely groundless. Its mission is only to tear down anti-Japanese slogans and has no intention of disrupting public order. The Japanese authorities will control its actions so that it does not go beyond the scope of the law. Also, rumors of activities by Japanese ronin are just talks of seeing ghosts after the disturbance in Tianjin. In recent weeks, the Japanese authorities have conducted investigations and have not seen any ronin coming to Shanghai from Japan.</p>
<h3>7,000 Chinese Students Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>Statistics from the Past Two Months</p>
<p>Since the violent Japanese occupied our Northeast on September 18, Chinese students in Japan have been angrily returning home in an endless stream. After investigation, from September 19 to October 13, a total of 3,192 students and Chinese merchants returned to China from various ports in Japan by Japanese ships. In addition, more than 800 people came to Shanghai on British and American merchant ships. From October 14 to the 13th of this month, a total of 2,670 Chinese returned to Shanghai from various places in Japan by Japanese ships, and about 500 people arrived in Shanghai by British and American merchant ships. In total, about 7,000 Chinese returned to China from Japan in two months. This does not include those who went directly to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Tianjin in North China. There are now few Chinese in Japan.</p>
<h3>Stores Will Post Slogans Saying "We Do Not Sell Japanese Goods"</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to various trade associations, stating that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association had written to say that since the boycott of Japanese goods, compatriots from all walks of life have acted with conscience, not buying or selling, and have been strictly enforcing this to this day, not without success. However, anti-Japanese national salvation requires a spirit of perseverance and, above all, a clear attitude. The association has repeatedly received suggestions from all walks of life that the anti-Japanese movement in stores still lacks a uniform and clear expression. According to the suggestion of the Design Committee of this association, please ask the various trade associations to print and distribute the slogan "This store does not sell Japanese goods" to each store and post it at the entrance to alert both customers and ourselves and avoid suspicion. This letter is hereby sent to your association, asking you to inform all industries to follow suit. Upon approval of this, the most important basic work of this boycott of Japanese goods lies in the automatic boycott of goods by merchants in all industries. What the association said is a crucial method for strictly implementing the boycott of goods. This letter is hereby sent for notification, and you are requested to follow it.</p>

<h3>The Anti-Japanese Association Again Requests a Reduction in the Coal Freight Rate in Shandong</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has already received approval from the Ministry of Railways to cancel the increase in the coal freight rate on the Jiaoji Railway. At this time of boycotting Japanese coal, it is an opportunity to actively revitalize it. The association has further requested another reduction. The following are the incoming and outgoing approvals:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways approves the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's request to cancel the increase in the coal freight rate on the Jiaoji Railway. The reply stated that the Jiaoji Railway's various coal mines are mostly jointly operated by China and Japan, and the actual power is entirely in the hands of the Japanese. The coal produced is mostly transported and sold to Japan. The purely Chinese-owned mines are only three small mines. The freight rate increase is small, and the impact on the Chinese-owned mines is very small. Merchants use coal shortages as an excuse, but it is just a sensational statement. In fact, even if the freight rate is reduced, Lumei cannot supply Shanghai in large quantities. It just allows the Japanese to obtain cheaper coal. Most groups do not understand the truth and are easily deceived by coal merchants. However, this department also believes that at present, foreign coal imports are very few, and fuel in various places is easily exhausted. The first method of relief should be to encourage coal mines to increase production. It has been planned to indirectly encourage domestic coal and increase production from the railway side, but it is necessary that the coal produced by the coal merchants should no longer be transported to Japan, but should be transported to Shanghai as much as possible. The Jiaoji Railway has been instructed to negotiate with the coal merchants, but the coal merchants have not yet agreed to this condition. It can be seen that the coal merchants' statement about the coal shortage is just an excuse and is only for their own benefit, and they do not care about the coal shortage in various parts of the country at all. According to the various sections of the presentation, the relevant line should be approved, and you should be informed of this approval.</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association presents to the Ministry of Railways: The presentation is for the coal freight rate, and again requests a grant to reduce it in order to maintain coal transportation. I belong to the association. Because of maintaining the coal shortage, I presented to request the cancellation of the coal freight rate increase on the Jiaoji Railway. I received your ministry's second-zero-seven approval, and so on. I admire your concern for coal transportation. It is a public feeling. However, when the supply of domestic coal is insufficient, the Jiaoji Railway's coal freight rate is increased, which will inevitably be used as an excuse by coal merchants. For the sake of comprehensive planning, I still ask your ministry to weigh the situation and reduce it to benefit coal transportation. Upon approval, the former reason, in addition to informing the Coal Industry Association, will be prepared again and reported. I pray that your ministry will review and grant a reduction to maintain coal transportation, which is really for the public convenience. I present this respectfully.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Close One After Another</h3>
<p>Fourteen Factories Reluctantly Maintain</p>
<p>45,000 Workers Lose Their Jobs</p>
<p>The city's silk industry has been affected by various factors in recent years, resulting in sluggish business and weak strength, and is in a position of being unable to maintain itself. Although the Ministry of Industry issued public bonds to provide relief, it was like a drop in the bucket and did not help. In addition, the New York silk market fell in price, and foreign sales disappeared. There was no way to promote sales in the country. They had to close down one after another. At present, the sales in foreign companies have not improved, and the by-products have been stopped from being sold to Japanese merchants for the sake of anti-Japanese national salvation, which has made it even more impossible to maintain. As of yesterday, among the city's 106 single-palace factories and seven double-palace factories, only three factories in the third district, Xiangfeng, Zhifeng, and Xuxing, and six factories in the Zhabei district, Yufeng, and five factories in the Hongkou district, Fulun, were reluctantly maintaining operations. There are only fourteen factories in the city, but the financial situation has become extremely urgent. If the silk market does not improve, they will soon be unable to maintain operations and will continue to close down to wait for the opportunity. As a result, more than 45,000 male and female workers have lost their jobs.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Commit Violence on Pingliang Road</h3>
<p>Children and Workers Beaten</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, six Japanese Navy Marines, riding two motorcycles, were traveling east on Pingliang Road in Yangshupu. When they reached near the small vegetable market, the Japanese soldiers saw a child walking on the road and thought that he was blocking their progress. They immediately got off the motorcycles and beat the child severely dozens of times. At that time, those who saw it by the roadside thought that the Japanese soldiers were so barbaric and hateful, and they all stepped forward to reason with them. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers not only refused to listen to reason, but also took out their guns to intimidate them. Fortunately, the police heard the news and sent police officers to disperse the Japanese soldiers and send the injured child to the hospital for treatment. However, at around 1:00 PM, four more Japanese soldiers caused trouble on Pingliang Road and severely beat a worker.</p>
<h3>Two Female Kidnappers Brought Back</h3>
<p>Han Quanfa Identified He Yonggen in Court, Recounting the Truth</p>
<p>Early last month, the home of farmer Han Liansheng in Liuzaoji, Dazhangjing, Songjiang, was suddenly invaded by bandits, who robbed tens of thousands of copper coins. Before leaving, they kidnapped his 13-year-old son, Quanfa, and took him by boat to Shanghai, hiding him at No. 1041, Sanyi Lane, Yangzhou Road. They were guarded by Anhui women Yin Zhao and Xu Shuai and demanded a ransom of 500 silver dollars. The case was discovered by Wan Guozhong, captain of the First Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police Bureau stationed in Zhujing Town, Jinshan County. On the afternoon of the 30th, at 8:15 PM, he led detectives to the location, rescued the hostage Han Quanfa, and returned him to his family. Subsequently, the two women's landlord, a Wuxi native, reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to detain the two women, Yin and Xu, and bring them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Zhou Liancheng, captain of the Jiangsu Water Police Team, accompanied the Han child to the Third Criminal Court, requesting the transfer of the two women. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, presented the case, stating that after the incident, the bandits sent a letter to the victim Han Liansheng's family, setting a deadline for the ransom and specifying a meeting point outside the Waibaidu Bridge in the Shanghai British Concession. The person coming should be a woman, holding a red package and an umbrella with a white towel tied to the handle, carrying the money for payment. Otherwise, they would prepare a coffin to collect the body. Now that the Han child is in court to testify, the police station has expressed its agreement to the transfer of the two women. The bandit's letter was submitted for review. The child, Han Quanfa, testified that he was a villager from Songjiang. That night, while sleeping in his bed at home, he was suddenly carried out by several people and taken by boat to Shanghai. He stayed at the two women's house (the two defendants) for about a month, sleeping with the defendant Yin Zhao every night. Later, several detectives from the Public Security Bureau came and rescued him back home. He came with his brother-in-law, He Yonggen, etc. According to He, after Han Quanfa was kidnapped, the bandits sent a letter demanding 500 silver dollars. He reported to the local authorities and, together with Inspector Gu, disguised as villagers, waited at the Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai for many days. Someone came and asked him if he was sent by Han's family. He answered yes. The person said that if the 500 silver dollars were paid, Han could be brought home. He pleaded in many ways, offering to pay 200 silver dollars and requesting to see the child at the hiding place. The person agreed and went with him to the two defendants' house. They went upstairs and saw the child sleeping on the floor with a woman. He only saw the back view. The person told him to go downstairs quickly and not make any noise, or he would be shot dead. He obeyed and returned to the inn. Later, Inspector Gu and the team leader rushed over and rescued Quanfa. Zhou Liancheng, captain of the Water Patrol Team, also submitted an official letter requesting the transfer of the two women. Judge Shen Bingrong briefly questioned Yin and Xu and ordered them to be handed over to Zhou Liancheng, captain of the Second Sub-Team of the First Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police Bureau, to be brought back.</p>
<h3>What Xue Guisheng Heard After Being Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Sha Lushen Went Out Together</p>
<p>A Ransom of Two Million Silver Dollars Demanded</p>
<p>After the death of Xue Baorun, a well-known wealthy merchant in the local dye industry, he left behind a large amount of assets. His sons and nephews previously engaged in lawsuits in court over the division of the inheritance. Before one trouble was settled, another arose. Xue's third son, Guisheng, was recently kidnapped by bandits. It has been ten days, and there has been no news of his release. The day after the kidnapping, some newspapers reported it, but because Xue's family denied the kidnapping, it became a suspected case. Now, according to Xue's relatives, Guisheng was indeed kidnapped ten days ago at his second concubine's house at No. 98, Masnan Road, in the French Concession. A man named Sha Lushen, now over sixty years old, used to run a yanzike (opium den) but is now unemployed. He and Guisheng were very close and often visited each other. Guisheng also trusted him very much and often traveled with Sha by car. On that day, because the second concubine wanted to buy clothes and ornaments costing 20,000 silver dollars, but Guisheng did not have the money, Sha offered to borrow the money for him, only requiring Guisheng to go and sign the documents, and the money could be paid. Guisheng then went out with Sha by car that evening and never returned. Sha's whereabouts are also unknown and he has not returned to this day. After Guisheng was kidnapped, two letters were received from the bandits demanding a ransom of two million silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Shi Longhai's Unrequited Love</h3>
<p>Trouble Originated from Eating Fermented Rice Balls</p>
<p>The Lao Song Sheng Fermented Rice Ball shop at the entrance of the City God Temple has been open for decades and has always been very prosperous. One of the employees, Shi Longhai, is 21 years old, from Chongming, and unmarried. He started working at the shop last year and was diligent. The shop then opened a branch at Xinzha Bridge in the North City. In July of this year, due to a shortage of employees, Shi was transferred to work at the branch. There was an elderly woman surnamed Zhou living nearby, also from Chongming, who had a very beautiful daughter. The mother and daughter both loved fermented rice balls, so they often went to the branch to enjoy the taste, and thus became acquainted with Shi. After seeing the girl, Shi fell in love with her and often went to the woman's house in his spare time to chat with her. The girl only considered Shi an acquaintance, so she treated him casually. However, Shi's love deepened day by day, and he tied himself to her with a thread of affection, pursuing her unrequitedly. Because of the circumstances, he could not achieve his desired goal, so he thought about it day and night, and had no intention of managing his work. He eventually suffered a deep stimulation to his nerves and suddenly developed a mental illness at the beginning of this month. He stayed in a corner all day, bowing his head in thought, neglecting his work, and often sighing. Recently, he became thin and refused to eat, and his speech was also abnormal. He even gesticulated wildly. The people in the shop knew that he had contracted a lovesickness disease. The shop was planning to find a way to deal with it, but unexpectedly, after dinner the day before yesterday, he suddenly disappeared. They immediately sent people to search in different directions, but there was no trace of him. Everyone was anxious. Then, Luo Fuchang, a police officer from the 17th post of the First Sub-Bureau of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, found a man at the Huining Wharf in the South City at around 2:00 AM yesterday, wandering around and shouting. Police Officer Luo thought that it was late at night, how could he shout so loudly and disturb people's dreams? He immediately stepped forward to question him about his origin. However, he did not answer the questions, which was very strange. He immediately brought him to the station, where the chief interrogated him. He confessed that his name was Shi Longhai, but the rest of his words were vague. It was discovered that he had a mental illness, and he was ordered to stay temporarily, waiting for his family to claim him. Afterwards, it was discovered that the man was Shi Longhai, an employee of Lao Song Sheng, and the above situation was investigated. It was found to be laughable and pitiful. So, his brother Shi Haijiang was summoned to the station and took his brother back, ordering him to go to the hospital for treatment immediately. It was heard that when Shi Longhai left the station, his mental illness flared up again, and he broke a porcelain spittoon and several glass windows in the station.</p>
<h3>Diamond Fraud Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Jewelry Broker He Zhicheng, a native of Suzhou, accompanied a Japanese man, Sankou, to Lili Jewelry Store at No. 31, Wusong Road, on the morning of the 7th of last month. They defrauded four diamonds worth more than 5,000 silver dollars and sold them at Tianchengxiang Jewelry Store in Xinbeimen, obtaining 2,800 silver dollars. He fled to the capital and returned to his hometown. After the case was discovered, the Hongkou Police Station sent detectives to Suzhou and detained him at the First Special District Court. Afterwards, his accomplice, Chen Jinlong, a native of Tongzhou, was also arrested. The testimonies of the two defendants have been previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the stolen goods, the four diamonds, had been redeemed by the plaintiff, Zhou Chunbo, from Tianchengxiang Jewelry Store in Xinbeimen, Huajie, for 2,800 silver dollars. The part of the Japanese man, Sankou, had been settled out of court. However, the 800 silver dollars that He had deposited in the Nanjing Shanghai Bank were being processed by the court, and the plaintiff could withdraw them from the Shanghai head office. The diamonds were then presented for inspection. Zhou Chunbo also reported the details of redeeming the diamonds from Tianchengxiang. After Judge Shen verified the report and questioned the two defendants, he announced the conclusion of the debate in this case and scheduled a date for sentencing. The four diamonds were first handed over to the plaintiff, Zhou Bochun, for collection.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Exhibition Held at the Plantation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Plantation has been established for almost ten years and is known for cultivating chrysanthemums. Over the years, it has spared no effort in collecting famous chrysanthemums from home and abroad. The products are of excellent quality and extraordinary value. Every autumn, a chrysanthemum exhibition is held, which has received favorable comments from Chinese and foreign visitors. This year, hundreds of new varieties have been collected, including more than eighty varieties of Wen Chrysanthemums, which have always been secretly treasured and are not easily seen outside. The garden uses a cliff-style planting method, with tails reaching four or five feet in length, majestic leaves, and bright flower colors, which is truly a spectacle. Now that the famous flowers are competing for beauty and thousands of buds are blooming, it is heard that the owner of the garden, Yu Shun'en, originally planned to hold a grand exhibition as usual, but considering the current national crisis, he did not want to be extravagant. He only selected the best of the famous chrysanthemums and displayed them in the garden in Jiangwan on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of this month, welcoming visitors from all walks of life without the need for tickets. This is an excellent opportunity for chrysanthemum lovers. It is expected that many reclusive people will visit the eastern fence and the three paths. The address of the garden is No. 1444, Xiangyin Road intersection of the East Sports Association Road, Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Sacrifices in the Tianjin Incident</h3>

<p>Cao Guoxian, a 62-year-old Shaoxing native residing at No. 32, Qiujiang Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, used to be a coppersmith but is now unemployed at home. He has only one son, named Yushu, who works at the Jinpu Railway Transportation Office. Recently, due to the incident in Tianjin, after Guoxian read the newspaper, fearing for his beloved son's life, he wrote five or six letters urging him to return to Shanghai. However, Yushu, upon receiving the family's message, could not leave immediately due to his duties. Guoxian, unable to see his son return to Shanghai for a long time, suspected that he must have died in the disaster. His nerves were stimulated, and he suddenly had a rash idea. Yesterday morning, at around 2:00 AM, he took a razor and cut his throat, causing profuse bleeding. Upon hearing the alarm, his neighbors arrived, hired a car, and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Cao's injuries are serious and his life may be in danger. It is heard that his son Yushu arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Anxious Groom Snatches Bride Before Wedding Date</h3>
<p>Patrol Officer, Suspecting Kidnapping, Immediately Arrested Him</p>
<p>Zhang Zhu, a 45-year-old woman from Taizhou living at No. 24, Tanjiadu, North Caojiadu, Huxi, works for a living in a yarn factory. She has a daughter named Lan Ying, who is 29 years old. She is pretty and works in the factory with her mother. She is intelligent, diligent, and hardworking, so her mother cherishes her like a pearl in her hand. Many relatives and friends have proposed marriage, but she has not agreed because none of them were suitable. It was not until May of last year that she was betrothed to a man surnamed Chen from the same hometown living in Huiwen Lane, Datong Road, through a matchmaker. The betrothal gift was set at 200 silver dollars, and the wedding was scheduled to take place this year. The Chen family, after the betrothal, is currently preparing the dowry. Unexpectedly, the groom Chen Rujiang, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at around 5:00 PM, invited a relative, Peng Xiangyao, and hired a car with the Shanghai Concession registration number 17830, which stopped near Tanjiadu. At that moment, Zhang Zhu and her daughter Lan Ying were leaving the factory and walking hand in hand. Before they had gone far, the groom and Peng rushed up and dragged the girl into the waiting car. Zhang Zhu, seeing her daughter being snatched away and the car starting, was furious and shouted after it. A patrol officer saw this and, suspecting a kidnapping case, immediately stopped the car and arrested them together, bringing them back to the Sixth District Police Station. According to the statements of Zhang Zhu and her daughter, as mentioned above, and the statement of the defendant Chen Rujiang, 23 years old, from Taizhou, residing at No. 1107, Huiwen Lane, Datong Road, he was betrothed to Zhang Zhu's daughter in May of this year, and the wedding date had been set and was about to take place. However, Zhang Zhu suddenly demanded an additional 200 silver dollars for an "opening door fee." He had already agreed to give 30 silver dollars, but she insisted, so he hated her and did this. According to Peng Xiangyao's statement, it was the same as above. According to the driver Xu Jinbao, 24 years old, Chen Rujiang hired him to drive here and snatched the girl into the car, and he did not know the rest of the situation. After obtaining the statements, the District Chief determined that the case involved forcibly snatching the bride, which was inappropriate, and immediately prepared a document and transferred them to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Traffickers Abduct Two Children</h3>
<p>Trafficker Wang Wu, from Jiangbei, and his concubine, an old woman, abducted two children and were staying at a small newly opened inn on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. They planned to take the opportunity to sell them to Fujian. However, at this time of tense situation, passengers on each ship had to have their backgrounds checked. As a result, the trafficker dared not take a ship elsewhere, and they had exhausted their money. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, they were wandering around the entrance of Lixian Lane on Xixinqiao Street. A French police detective found their circumstances suspicious and stepped forward to investigate. The trafficker tried to escape but was caught, along with the two abducted children, and taken to the Grand Self-Ringing Bell Police Station for detention, awaiting transfer to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Escaped Prostitute Gets Lost and Turns Herself in to the Police Station</h3>
<p>Suffered So Much That She Jumped Out of the Fire Pit</p>
<p>Wang Jinlian, a young woman from Xinghua, 28 years old, with a beautiful appearance and slender figure, used to work with her mother in the countryside, living in extreme poverty. She had a younger brother named Wang Chaoxi, who was an apprentice at a big sesame cake shop in Shanghai. Last spring, a fellow villager surnamed Zhang returned to the village from Shanghai and, seeing Jinlian's beauty, used his seductive methods to trick her into coming to Shanghai, falsely claiming that he had found her brother and could introduce her to work in a factory. However, after Jinlian arrived in Shanghai, she was sold by Zhang to a brothel at No. 149, Hongxiang Lane, North Nicheng Bridge, in the Public Concession. Thus, Jinlian was forced to become a prostitute, living a life of selling her body. Knowing that she had been deceived, she regretted it too late. Jinlian, being a country girl, was unwilling to do this lowly job, so the madam used all sorts of oppression and abuse. Jinlian became more and more depressed, crying secretly, with tears constantly soaking her collar. Recently, the madam, seeing that Jinlian was not good at business, would beat her if she was not satisfied. Jinlian could not bear the pain and wanted to escape this cage, but she had no opportunity to take advantage of. The day before yesterday afternoon, the madam of the brothel happened to go out. Jinlian took the opportunity to escape, but because she was unfamiliar with the place, she had nowhere to hide. She ran to Caojiadu in Huxi. Because it was already dusk, she had a quick idea and went to the Sixth District Police Station, requesting help. After questioning by the District Chief, he determined that the woman had been trafficked into prostitution, had suffered, and had escaped, which was truly pitiful. He immediately prepared a document and sent her to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and disposal.</p>
<h3>Cause of Cui Chunting's Death Unclear</h3>

<h3>Lu Shiyi Invents Essential Oils</h3>
<p>Plans to Organize an Oil Industry Factory to Develop Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Our country's agricultural and industrial sectors are extremely underdeveloped. Therefore, in international trade, exports are mostly raw materials, and imports are mostly manufactured goods. Checking the customs reports, the difference between imports and exports over the years has been that imports exceed exports. The difference in quantity is gradually decreasing year by year. Last year, the total value of imports was 680 million taels of silver, an increase of 9 percent. Exports decreased by 51 million taels compared to the previous year, a decrease of 14 percent. For example, the trade in major exports such as silk, tea, and vegetable oil has been occupied by Japan, the United States, and India. Taking only vegetable oils and vegetable seeds as an example, the annual export value is about 220 million taels of silver. However, because the Chinese people do not value agriculture and industry and do not know how to improve, it is feared that it will be impossible to maintain the status quo in the future. Now, Mr. Lu Shiyi, with his own insights, uses scientific methods to refine various vegetable oil raw materials produced in the Northeast into essential oils. He submitted them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for inspection and was approved with comments such as "The oil samples are quite excellent and worthy of praise." This oil was tested by American oil merchants in Beiping and recognized as the best vegetable oil. They were willing to sign contracts to purchase it in large quantities and ship it to South America for sale. At this time of national crisis, saving the country through materials should not be delayed. In order to develop foreign trade and regain rights and interests, it is planned to organize a large-scale vegetable oil industry factory. It is hoped that enthusiastic industrialists at home and abroad will cooperate and that public opinion will support and promote it, which may be of some help to the future of our country's industry.</p>
<h3>News from the Municipal Federation and District Sub-Associations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations sends a telegram to the Ministers of all nations in China, forwarding the message to the Ministers and Consuls of all nations in China for their review: Regarding the fact that Japan is occupying Chinese territory by force and its atrocities, our government and people have repeatedly reported faithfully. We hope that wise friends will take note. Now, Japan not only does not comply with the resolution of the League of Nations to withdraw its troops by a deadline, but also intensifies its aggression and robbery. It has used heavy troops to plot against our Heilongjiang province and instigated Japanese ronin residing in Tianjin to change into Chinese clothes and carry out disturbances. It also openly opened fire and bombed, indicating that its intention is nothing more than to use the excuse of protecting overseas Chinese to reoccupy Shenyang, as before. Such behavior not only destroys the security of Tianjin and endangers the lives and property of Chinese people, but also harms foreign nationals traveling in Tianjin. Moreover, this action has disregarded the principles of the League of Nations, destroyed international peace, and violated the provisions of international law. Wise friends of all nations should seriously pay attention to this for the sake of international peace, justice, and humanity, and not be misled by the cunning arguments of the Japanese and disregard right and wrong. We would be most fortunate. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations, Han.</p>

<p>Twenty-Sixth District Citizens' Association: The Twenty-Sixth District Sub-Association sent a telegram to the National Government yesterday stating that the cruel Japanese army is acting without restraint. Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and Heilongjiang is in danger. Japanese soldiers in civilian clothes in Tianjin instigated ronin to attack and disrupt the local area. When the news came, the whole country was outraged. Our country has always upheld justice and abided by treaties, hoping that the League of Nations will uphold fairness and issue a resolution ordering Japan to withdraw its troops. Now that the deadline has arrived, the violent Japanese not only do not think about complying, but dare to intensify their actions. The actions in Nenjiang and Tianjin show that there is no retreat, and they intend to destroy the League of Nations treaties and prestige. Troop withdrawal will ultimately be an empty promise. To seek national independence and fight for national survival, it is better to rely on ourselves than to ask others. We must make a painful determination, resolutely formulate a national salvation plan, and fight to the death with the violent Japanese. Chinese youths are willing to fight with iron blood. With the immortal spirit of the people, we will unite and eliminate the Japanese barbarians to save the sinking divine land and comfort the people's hearts. The national crisis is imminent. We hope that our government will make a quick decision. Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Association Twenty-Sixth District Sub-Association bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>Telephone Company Dismisses Large Number of Workers</h3>
<p>Will Petition Party and Government Organs for Assistance</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Company in this city switched to automatic switchboards, the workers it previously employed have inevitably faced layoffs. The Lan Lu (Avenue Dubail) Eastern District Factory dismissed more than 70 veteran workers with over ten years of service the day before yesterday. They were not given severance pay, and their accumulated savings over the years were not fully returned. Upon hearing this, all the workers were greatly alarmed, believing that foreigners were oppressing Chinese workers excessively. Because they lacked a formal organization, they had no way to appeal. Yesterday afternoon, they sent Mr. Yang to the preparatory committee of the Third District Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union, requesting assistance. It is reported that the committee has instructed them to petition the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for review and action in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Guangdong National Salvation Association Telegraphs for the Execution of Du Xuantai</h3>
<p>The United Guangdong National Salvation Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the authorities stating: To the Executive Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the Chairman of the National Government, the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference, and the Wuhan Garrison Commander: Since the incident of the Japanese bandits forcibly occupying the Northeast, the people of the whole country have been filled with common hatred and resentment, determined to rise up in the movement to resist Japan and save the country, united to jointly resist foreign aggression. Unexpectedly, Du Xuantai, the director of the Eighth Public Security Bureau of Guangzhou City, used his police authority to order his subordinate police officers on October 10 to shoot and kill unarmed patriotic people of Guangdong, resulting in the tragic deaths of more than ten people and countless injuries. This is a heinous crime. He even dared to bribe his way to escape. Fortunately, Wuhan conducted a strict search and has reportedly captured him. This criminal will eventually face justice. Since this case occurred in Guangdong, for the sake of the country and our hometown, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specially telegraph Your Excellencies, requesting you to promptly issue an order to execute the criminal Du Xuantai on the spot by firing squad to appease public anger and uphold the law. Respectfully, the United Guangdong National Salvation Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Investigates and Replies Regarding the Use of Return Receipt Stamps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday investigated and replied to lawyer Yang Shaopeng regarding the usual practice of return receipt stamp styles and their effectiveness, in a letter that stated: Dear Sir, We received your esteemed letter of October 30, asking whether the stamp on the return receipt book, according to custom, is limited to being stamped with the words "return receipt," or whether it can be used in the same way without engraving the words "return receipt." We have now investigated the situation and responded in detail as follows: (1) Regarding the style of the return receipt stamp, there are no prescribed styles for the stamps used by various businesses in this city. Some have the words "return receipt" marked, while others do not mark these two words, but their effectiveness is the same. Only the return receipt stamps used by money houses all have the words "return receipt." For other industries, there are also some that use the business name seal, and some that only write the name of the business without even writing the words "business name seal." Recently, rubber stamps have also been used. (2) The effectiveness of the return receipt is only to indicate whether the goods have been received. As for the settlement of payment, in common practice, it is based on the invoice and ledger. Because whether the delivered goods will be used is not yet determined, merchants often accommodate buyers by sending several types of goods so they can choose what they want. When the customer receives these several types of goods, they stamp the return receipt book and give it back to the delivery person. After deciding which type of goods to use, they will return the other types to the original business. If you only look at the quantity on the return receipt book, it seems that the customer has received many types of goods, but in reality, they only use one type. This situation is very common in transactions. Because it is not known in advance whether goods will be used, there must be an indication of whether they have been received during delivery and return. Therefore, the return receipt book is used for the delivery person to stamp, indicating the situation at that time. That is why the return receipt stamps of money houses must be marked with words such as "not valid for accounting." Since the effectiveness of the return receipt is like this, the stamp used does not necessarily have to be limited to marking the two words "return receipt." If the merchant's usual return receipt stamp has the two words "return receipt" and is well-known to the other party, then a stamp without the two words "return receipt" is not sufficient as proof. We have prepared a letter in response and ask for your review.</p>
<h3>Dispute at the Dahua Match Factory</h3>
<p>The Dahua Match Factory in Liuliqiao, Pudong, has been in operation for three years. The factory owner has not made any changes to the treatment of workers. Because wages were deducted for the Double Ten National Day and the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth this year and not paid, labor union branch office staff member Cen Yunlai and others requested them from the factory on the 13th. It happened that the Pudong Inspection Office of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association discovered that the matchsticks in the factory were all Japanese goods. They sent personnel to the factory, and after an inspection, they were indeed enemy goods. They were sealed up and reported to the General Office for instructions. The factory, instead of blaming itself, took its anger out on others, ordering its confidant worker Feng Changgen and others to close the factory gate and, armed with iron bars, beat labor union staff member Cen Yunlai, Zhang Shuilin, and others. Even Chen Songyao, a representative of the district labor union, was beaten. At night, the factory used the Bao An Tuan (local security force) police to arrest two male workers. It is reported that those arrested and beaten this time were all labor union representatives.</p>
<h3>Zhang Chenghua Further Investigates Other Robbery Cases</h3>
<p>The bandit Zhang Chenghua, at around 8:00 AM on the 29th of last month, led a gang armed with weapons to rob the Sen Tai pawnshop at No. 40 Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, escaping with stolen goods. Later, a shop employee followed behind and sounded the alarm near Ba Xian Qiao (Eight Immortals Bridge), capturing Zhang. A pistol was seized, and he was taken to the police station. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and ordered to be detained pending further investigation. Now he is being re-interrogated. The police station lawyer stated that during the period of postponement, it was discovered that the defendant had also robbed the Feng Tai pawnshop set up by Guo Liang Ji at No. 324 Lan Weiai Road (Avenue Foch) on the morning of August 24, stealing goods and dividing the spoils for personal use. He had committed two robberies in total and requested interrogation. Then the victim testified about the robbery at that time. When Zhang Chenghua was interrogated, he confessed that he was indeed colluding with two fugitives, Xiao Fenzi and Zhou Mazi, and residents to commit the robbery. The presiding judge verified the confession and ordered the postponement of the interrogation for continuation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Taicang Robbery Case Awaiting Official Documents for Transfer</h3>
<p>On August 20 of this year, two bandit boats were suddenly discovered at the South Gate of Taicang County. After a while, several bandits armed with weapons landed and broke into the home of a resident named He Jintang. They took out pistols and forbade anyone from making a sound. They robbed a gold ring and seven silver dollars. As they were about to escape, the victim shouted loudly, and nearby police officers heard the sound and came to surround and arrest them. The two sides immediately opened fire, resulting in one bandit being killed on the spot, and the male and female victims were also shot and killed by the bandits. The remaining bandits all escaped. After the incident, the Taicang County Public Security Bureau arrested the criminals Bai Xiaojiuzi and a Mr. Pan, and others. They confessed that their accomplices were Anhui native Du Laosan (aka Zheng Liang), who worked as a night watchman at the Pu'an Coal Company on Tiantong Road in the Public Concession and was now hiding at No. 1306 Dongjing Road. Therefore, detectives Ren Songlin and Sun Changsheng from the Taicang Public Security Bureau came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and, together with Detective Zhang Changkun from the Putuo Road police station, went to the address and arrested Du. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Taicang County Public Security Bureau requested that he be transferred to their jurisdiction for interrogation and handling. However, police station lawyer Wang Yaotang argued that there were no official documents from Taicang County on file and requested a postponement until the official documents arrived. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and briefly questioned Du Laosan before ordering Du to be detained for postponement to the 17th, pending the arrival of official documents and evidence from Taicang County for further review.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Robbery Reports</h3>
<p>At 7:20 PM last night at No. 49 Yinyu Lane, Ba Xian Qiao (Eight Immortals Bridge), the home of Wu Hanmei, a Chaozhou native who works as an accountant at the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange, six robbers suddenly arrived. Four robbers held guns, and two robbers guarded the entire household. The four robbers entered the room to search and rob, first plundering as much jewelry and gold watches as possible, and then carrying out the largest leather suitcase. The suitcase contained five fur coats made of gray squirrel and other materials. They hired a rickshaw and escaped eastward without a trace. Two robbers remained behind, and it was about a quarter of an hour after the rickshaw left before the two fled. The total loss is estimated at more than 1,500 yuan. Afterward, the victim filed a report with the police station requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM last night at the Danjing Temple, No. 12 Xi'ai Xian Si Road (Avenue Foch), French Concession, five or six fierce robbers suddenly arrived, each holding a pistol, and forbade anyone from making a sound. They locked all the people in the temple together in one room and searched and robbed at will. After about 20 minutes, they each carried away the stolen goods and escaped without a trace. After a detailed investigation of the losses, it was estimated that 825 silver dollars, two gold rings, and jade and precious miscellaneous items worth about 1,000 yuan in total were robbed. The victim then reported to the police station requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>"Secrets of the Manchurian-Mongolian Conference" Published</h3>
<p>It has been more than a month since the Japanese bandits invaded and occupied the Northeast. Although the League of Nations has passed a resolution limiting the withdrawal of troops to the 16th of this month, it is feared that this will become a dream. Based on observing past facts and recent continuous atrocities, it is indeed a planned and step-by-step action of Japanese imperialism. The International Problems Research Society has now compiled and translated the book "Secrets of the Manchurian-Mongolian Conference" in order to awaken the people to jointly face the national crisis. The book exposes Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia and its conspiracy to destroy China as much as possible, which is ten thousand times more vicious than the Tanaka Memorial. Patriotic compatriots, if you cannot bear to see your motherland perish and sit idly by waiting for death, you should have a copy per person to see the animalistic face of Japanese imperialism and devise a plan to kill the enemy. The hardcover book sells for 30 cents, and it has inscriptions by Mr. Wu Kaixian and Xu Peihuang, and prefaces by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Pan Yangyao, and Yao Su Feng. The general sales office is the Xinmin Library on Jiaotong Road, Qipan Street. For out-of-town mail orders, send them to the Society at Yuqingli, X斜 Bridge South.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry: The Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association convened various industries of the same trade the day before yesterday and held a special meeting. Changtai Bank reported that Zhang Haisheng's boat carrying 45 pieces of Dalian soybean oil, totaling 150 dan, worth more than 3,000 yuan, was transported to Maigen Station for unloading and entrusted to Qingji Forwarding Company for transshipment, declaring it as the Beijing-Shanghai train and transporting it to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, the ship suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere without a trace, a reward of 100 yuan was published in the newspaper, and someone was entrusted to investigate the whereabouts of the ship. Later, someone reported that Zhang Haisheng had abandoned it at the Baihegang, west of the Suzhou River. The boatman had escaped, leaving only an empty boat, and the soybean oil it was carrying had been stolen and sold. After discussion by the colleagues, because Zhang Haisheng's boat dared to steal and sell goods transported to this port and abandon the boat to escape, our industry relies entirely on ship transport, and colleagues hire ships for transport every day. If this is the case, colleagues will suffer a lot in the future. It was resolved to petition the local and foreign land and water authorities to strictly arrest and investigate. However, the bank issued a reward of 100 yuan, and now this association will issue another reward of 100 yuan, and this association will also petition various government offices and the Water Police Department to strictly arrest and handle the case.</p>
<p>Coal and Stone Barge Industry: The Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association has recently received reports from various members that the National Seaport Quarantine Office is forcibly collecting disinfection donations, which is overwhelming, and requests for relief. The association immediately submitted a petition to the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs the day before yesterday, requesting that the主管 department allow the exemption in order to maintain people's lives. The document stated, "Petition for the Seaport Quarantine Office to collect disinfection fees, and for all civilian ships, we request permission to be exempted in order to maintain a livelihood. We have repeatedly received reports from our affiliated members that the National Seaport Quarantine Office is forcing civilian ships in the inner port to disinfect and collecting a handling fee of 3.5 yuan per ship every six months, which the poor boaters cannot afford. We request a solution. It is found that the Seaport Quarantine Office is indeed an important health administration. When foreign merchant ships enter the port, due to the large number of people, there is inevitably a risk of infectious diseases, so they should be inspected. However, civilian ships that only sail in the inner port do not need quarantine. Why should they use the excuse of disinfection to collect huge sums of money? Furthermore, it was not clearly announced by the central government in advance, nor was the consent of the people obtained. The forced implementation of ship industry donations and taxes is inherently flawed, and how can it bear this burden again? We hereby submit a document requesting a quick solution and requesting the主管 department to allow free of charge to maintain people's lives."</p>

It was resolved to refuse to load all of them and notified members to check. (3) The Sino-Japanese Trade Commodity Investigation Institute sent a letter requesting collection of Japanese commodity samples for display. It was resolved that the existing Japanese goods have all been sealed, so it is not convenient to collect. (4) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Committee for Implementing Economic Severance with Japan sent a form to send the Japanese goods that had been imported before the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It was resolved to copy a copy of the number of sealed Japanese goods.</p>

How should this be investigated? It was resolved: (1) Report to the higher authorities for investigation according to law. (2) Publish a notice to members and the outside world. (3) In the future, if any unscrupulous people come to spread rumors and swindle, we hope that they will be handed over to the military police for detention and punishment to clear the source of the chaos. Passed. Adjourned.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>How to Promote and Sustain the Volunteer Army Training</h3>
<p>— Qingyuan Shi</p>
<p>The training methods should start from various labor unions, institutions, and schools. (1) Tell them, "A person's body is not strong, even if they have profound knowledge and morality, it is useless. Ancient Rome was once the most civilized country, but it was eventually destroyed by the brave and fierce Germanic tribes. The civilization of a weak country can never match the military strategies of a strong country. This is an unchanging truth throughout the ages. Although China is an ancient civilized country with more than four thousand years of history, if it does not engage in military training, the result will be a second Rome. Therefore, military training is the only way to save the country." (2) Tell them, "The Westerner Bismarck said, 'Public law cannot be relied upon, only red blood and black iron can be relied upon.' Indeed, when China is at its wit's end and national disaster is imminent, the government still does not resist, but remains calm and waits for the League of Nations to resolve it. This kind of behavior is all daydreaming and not waking up. If this continues, the country will perish. As the saying goes, 'Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from oneself.' Now, what can save the country is nothing else but our patriotic zeal and black iron. To use this zeal and black iron, we must engage in military training." (3) Tell them, "Although China has millions of troops, surpassing all countries, they are actually just a rabble, wasting China's money. If you want to remove one or two tenths of the old and weak, take profit from them, and another one or two tenths of those who have no patriotic heart, and then remove half of those who have smoking habits and hobbies, how many are left? Such an army, to resist the aggression of the great powers, is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Therefore, although China has many troops, they cannot be relied upon. What can be relied upon is still ourselves engaging in training." By promoting this in various counties, cities, and villages, it will not be difficult to popularize and promote. Methods for sustaining it: (1) Compile a volunteer army register, ordering all provinces, counties, cities, towns, and villages across the country to conduct a household survey every year. Children aged ten and above, in addition to uniformly attending school, must also enter the volunteer army register, emphasizing gymnastics and gradually introducing military exercises. Middle school students, whose physical strength is already strong, can implement military exercises. Middle school or university graduates, or farmers and workers who are twenty years old, must serve as volunteer soldiers for three years. After three years, they will retire to become reserve soldiers, and after another three years, they will retire to become rear reserve soldiers. They can be immediately called up in times of war until they are fifty years old. (2) The government should order all provinces, counties, cities, towns, and villages to implement it according to law, stipulating regular drills every month. Those who are excellent will be given awards to encourage them. If this is the case, the spirit of martial arts will prevail throughout the country. If something happens one day, we will surely win in battle and defend firmly. The vast territory of China will never be encroached upon or swallowed up by others. (3) In terms of funding, in addition to donations, the government must do its best to subsidize it. Because the nature of the volunteer army is a temporary fundraising effort, those who have money are not a problem, but those who have a difficult life will find it difficult to respond to the call. If the majority of people do not agree to donate, the volunteer army will fail. This is a definite principle. To make it last permanently, the government must subsidize at least half of the funds. If the above three points can be implemented, the sustainability of the volunteer army will not be a problem.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Tai Shuangqiu Submits a Proposal to the Fourth Plenary Session on Relieving Elementary School Teachers in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>According to reports, the current floods in our country have affected sixteen provinces, with 100 million disaster victims. Among these 100 million people, those who live the most bitterly and are most in need of relief and should be specially assisted are elementary school teachers. The reasons are fourfold:</p>
<p>1. Elementary school teachers receive meager salaries, and eight or nine out of ten have no permanent property. In good years, they are already on the verge of freezing and starvation. How can they survive in famine years? This is the first reason why they should be specially assisted. 2. Elementary school teachers make a living by teaching. Manual labor is not something they are accustomed to, and due to their status, once they encounter famine, they will never be able to compete with ordinary laborers for sweat and blood to maintain their lives. Even if they have a small amount of savings, they will inevitably die of starvation. This is the second reason why they should be specially assisted. 3. Elementary school teachers bear the heavy responsibility of educating the nation. According to actual surveys, each teacher teaches an average of 26 students. Therefore, the starvation of one teacher means that 26 students will lose their education. The impact on the nation's vitality is not insignificant. This is the third reason why they should be specially assisted. 4. Elementary school teachers have considerable knowledge. Once they are forced by hunger and cold, if they are unwilling to sit and wait for death, they will inevitably go astray and harm society. The harm they cause is far greater than that of ordinary uneducated people. If we do not plan for them early, the future social disaster will be unimaginable. This is the fourth reason why they should be specially assisted. Based on the above reasons, it can be seen that specially assisting elementary school teachers in disaster areas is an urgent and indispensable task at present. Several relief measures are proposed as follows: 1. The Ministry of Education, together with the education departments of various disaster-stricken provinces, should immediately organize a "Disaster Area Education Relief Committee" to specially plan relief for elementary school teachers in disaster areas. 2. The remaining portions of flood relief donations from schools across the country that have not yet been distributed should be immediately allocated specifically for relieving elementary school teachers in disaster areas. 3. The Ministry of Education, together with the education departments of various disaster-stricken provinces, should estimate the number of elementary school teachers affected by the disaster and quickly formulate a budget and submit it to the central government for special allocation of funds for relief. 4. Investigate the losses of education funds and educational assets (such as school buildings and equipment) in disaster areas. Based on this number, the Ministry of Education should issue "Disaster Area Education Public Bonds" of several million to directly maintain education in disaster areas and indirectly relieve elementary school teachers affected by the disaster.</p>
<h3>Yu Enbo Continues to Act as Director of the Anhui Education Department</h3>
<p>Li Zhonggong Continues Leave for Two Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Education, stating, "In order to inform the governor, it is reported that Li Zhonggong, member of the Anhui Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, has submitted a telegram stating that he has previously continued his leave for two months due to illness. Now that the leave has expired, the illness has not yet healed, and he sincerely requests another two months of leave for recuperation. After this was submitted to the 46th National Affairs Conference of this Yuan, it was decided to approve it. In addition to instructing and reporting to the National Government and ordering the Anhui Provincial Government, the Ministry is hereby instructed to be informed and immediately order the current director, Yu Enbo, to continue acting as director to emphasize education." After receiving the order, the Ministry of Education yesterday instructed Mr. Yu to comply.</p>
<h3>Schools Do Not Need to Add National Humiliation Classes</h3>
<p>Explanation of the Ministry of Education Regarding the Proposal of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting that all schools be ordered to add a National Humiliation subject, stating that, according to the report of the Sixth District Party Department, a national crisis is imminent, and propaganda work should be intensified. Regarding the school curriculum, it seems necessary to add a National Humiliation class. Please forward this to the Municipal Education Bureau and order all schools to add a National Humiliation case every week to facilitate propaganda, etc. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Education Bureau submitted it to the Ministry of Education for review, stating that the matter concerned changing the name of the curriculum and central laws, and the Education Bureau could not act without authorization. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education yesterday instructed the Municipal Education Bureau, stating, "The report is noted. It is found that the materials on national humiliation regarding the imperialist invasion of China have already been included in the curriculum standards, and history, geography, and social studies are taught separately. During this national crisis, all schools can temporarily add extracurricular lectures and research on Japanese imperialism outside the existing curriculum to achieve practical results, without adding a separate National Humiliation subject, to avoid confusion. This order is hereby issued for your information."</p>
<h3>Delegation from the League of Nations Educational Investigation Gives a Lecture at Wuxi National College</h3>
<p>Messrs. Becker and Bohr-Silve of the League of Nations Educational Investigation Delegation went to Wuxi on the 12th of this month to investigate various schools and factories, as reported in the newspapers. At 10:00 AM on the 14th, accompanied by Gao Jiansi, Chen Lijiang, Lei Binnan, Tang Moubo, Yu Qingtang, Chen Huren, Lu Renshou, and others from the Wuxi educational community, they visited the National Sinology College and gave a lecture in the school's auditorium. Tang Moubo translated. First, Becker gave a lecture, the general idea being that, during this investigation in China, he was very interested in studying how Eastern nations preserve their inherent culture. In today's world, for a country to survive in the world, it must first study science. However, to study science, it must first awaken the national consciousness, and the awakening of the national consciousness can only be magnified by the country. Your school bears the responsibility of preserving the inherent culture, which is different from the mission of ordinary schools. I hope that the students of your school can organize Chinese history and compile history textbooks for use in large, medium, and small schools to promote the culture and scholarship of the Chinese nation and promote the awakening of national consciousness. Next, Lunxiwei spoke, the general idea being that this time we are representing the League of Nations to come to China to investigate education. The purpose of the League of Nations is to promote world peace and cooperation between countries. However, the meaning of cooperation is not mutual plagiarism of culture, but to seek that each country can preserve and promote its culture and contribute to the world. For example, although there have been many inventions in physics in the past thirty years, based on my personal experience, if I did not use the inventions of many physicists in the past as a foundation, I would not be able to progress so much. Now, to seek the development of Chinese culture and contribute to the world, it must also be based on its inherent culture. I very much hope that you will work hard. After the speeches, the principal of the school, Tang Weizhi, gave a reply.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Requests Posthumous Recognition of Student Status of New Students in the Nineteenth Year by Ministry Order</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department previously reported to the Ministry of Education, stating that the Jiangsu Private Soochow University reported that among the new students admitted in the first semester of the nineteenth year, Shi Yushu had graduated from the Shanghai Private Mingqiang Middle School, which was not registered. The graduation examination was directly conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, which assigned personnel to set questions and invigilate, and the graduation certificate was stamped with the words "Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau evaluates the results as qualified," which had been approved by the Ministry of Education for filing. Now, it is found that among those admitted at the same time, there are two new students, Weng Zhongen and Ma Xiancheng, who graduated from Mingqiang Middle School, and a female student, Ni Yazhen, who graduated from the Shanghai Private Yanmushi Girls' Middle School, which was not registered. These students also went through the procedures of having the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau assign personnel to set questions, invigilate, and stamp the graduation certificates when they graduated. The facts are completely the same as the filing situation of Shi Yushu. It seems that they should be invited to have the Ministry of Education approve the filing. The reasons are stated in the document, and the graduation certificates of these students are requested to be forwarded for verification and handling. Furthermore, if there are new students with the same situation as above in the future, should they be reported at any time to request verification of the certificates, or should they only be reported? How should it be handled? Please submit it to the Ministry for review and compliance, etc. Based on this, it is appropriate to forward it to the Ministry for review and instructions for compliance. Recently, the Ministry of Education issued an instruction stating, "The submitted documents are all noted. Weng Zhongen, Ma Xiancheng, Ni Yazhen, and other three new students of the university in the nineteenth year are approved for filing as a whole. In the future, if there are new students with the same situation, the certificates should still be submitted in a timely manner. The graduation certificates of these students are returned, and you are instructed to follow them separately."</p>

<h3>Xu Qian's Letter to the Board of Directors of the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law</h3>
<p>Xu Qian's letter to the Board of Directors of the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law states: "Esteemed Sirs, the former Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, now the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, was founded by me in 1924. By the autumn of 1926, I had raised private funds and borrowed money, totaling more than 82,000 taels of silver, to build the current buildings and all the equipment on Jin Shenfu Road. All borrowed money is secured by the school buildings and equipment, etc. The original repayment period has expired without repayment. The creditor can claim that the competent government agency will auction the collateral for compensation. However, this school has been occupied since the summer of 1927 and has been taken over by your Board of Directors. Nearly five years have passed, and all debts have not been fulfilled. The creditor has reported this to the Ministry of Education of the National Government. On November 1, 1930, the Ministry of Education issued an instruction that the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau separately informed your Board of Directors to clear the debts by the end of last year and informed Mr. Pan Zhenya, the representative of the creditor. Now, because the debts have not been repaid and I have read that the president, Zheng Yuxiu, has resigned and no one is responsible, Mr. Sun Ke, a director of the school, has inquired about your director of general affairs, Mr. Chen Qun, whether anyone in your college is continuing to be responsible for handling the debts or whether the school property will be returned. Our office will clear the debts itself. Mr. Chen replied in the letter that he is a staff member and cannot give a concrete answer. Our office must directly negotiate with your Board of Directors. Therefore, our office proposes the following three points: (1) The college and the school property are now two separate matters. The college is maintained by your Board of Directors, and the school property belongs to our office. If your Board of Directors is still willing to continue to run the college, please repay the debt of more than 82,000 taels according to the order of the Ministry of Education. (2) If your Board of Directors believes that the buildings and all equipment, including books, are not suitable, please return all the school property to our office to clear the debts ourselves. (3) If you are unwilling to do either of the above two points, please transfer the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law to our office for takeover in order to clear the debts and reorganize the college affairs. I am writing this letter to inquire and hope that your Board of Directors will choose one of the methods within seven days and give a definite reply. I hope that you will wish for success. Xu Qian, November 12, 1931."</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau replied to Lawyer Pan Xia Ya, stating, "Respected Sir, previously, we received your letter requesting that we urge the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law to pay the outstanding construction funds for the school buildings to Changsheng Construction Factory within five days. We have already recorded and forwarded the letter and replied to you. Now, we have received an instruction from the Ministry of Education stating, 'It is found that this case has been repeatedly ordered to be cleared by the school, but it has still not been complied with, which is contrary to the statement of the school's board of directors when applying for registration that they are very willing to be responsible for clearing the debts. Now, we will again limit the school to clear the debts of the school buildings by the end of this year, otherwise it will be dealt with according to regulations. Please forward it for compliance and inform the lawyer concerned.' In addition to ordering the college to comply, we hereby inform you for your information. To Lawyer Pan Xia Ya, Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, November 1, 1930."</p>

<h3>The Navy Has Strong Players, and East China Suffers</h3>
<p>Failed with Three to Four, Little Hope for Group A</p>
<p>Everyone thought that East China would definitely beat the British Navy yesterday, but who knew that the result was unexpected, losing with four to three. In total, East China has lost twice in the Group A competition, and hopes are probably dwindling from now on. The 3,000 spectators in Yiyuan were greatly disappointed and returned home. The referee was Li Dao.</p>
<h3>British Navy Lineup</h3>
<p>Hafemann Smith Cox Ashmun Robertson Heng Lai</p>
<p>Robinson Crawford Crawford Leisch Riefert Aifuye</p>
<p>East China Team Lineup</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Chen Huang, Chen Jiaqiu, Ouyang Yongyuan, Qian Jingyong, Chen Hongguang, Dai Linjing, Li Yichen, Chen Yutian</p>
<p>The Elite of the Navy</p>
<p>East China's defeat was no accident. Yesterday's Navy was the "Kent" ship, not defeated by the "Hermann" ship of Lehua and Jinan. The "Kent" is the champion team of the British Navy, and they arrived in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, having defeated the South China Football Team 2-0 in Hong Kong. No wonder East China was defeated by them.</p>
<p>East China Team's Diminished Performance</p>
<p>East China's diminished performance is one of the reasons for their defeat. It is said that both Li Ning and Chen Jiaqiu felt unwell. Tu Kaiyuan's absence led to Chen Jiaqiu moving to the center, and Ouyang Yongyuan appeared particularly weak. The weakness of the center defense line affected both the front and rear, and the coordination of the forwards was not as satisfactory as before.</p>
<p>Center Forward Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>East China kicked off and immediately advanced to attack, their momentum very strong. Chen Pu intercepted the ball and passed it to Chen Yutian, who advanced quickly and passed it to center forward Dai, who leaped up to shoot. The ball hit the goalpost and bounced back. After nearly ten minutes, Crawford of the Navy intercepted the ball with Guan and Chen Jiaqiu, then to Dai Linjing, who passed it to Chen Yutian, who let Smith pass and sent the ball to Dai. The center forward scored, and the East China team took the lead.</p>
<p>Iron Gate Defends Bitterly</p>
<p>After this loss, the Navy launched an attack, their momentum fierce. There were countless dangerous moments in front of the goal. Zhou Xianyan defended alone, and Aifuye came from the right, but Li Ning could not stop him. The ball went to the left, and Crawford kicked it in, tying the score at 1-1. The Navy pressed harder and harder, and the ball came from all directions. Once, Leisch shot fiercely, angling towards the upper right corner. Zhou Xianyan thought it was in, but it bounced off the side post, then off the crossbar, and out, which was fortunate. Such dangerous moments occurred frequently.</p>
<p>A Goal Scored in the Chaos</p>
<p>Although the Navy attacked fiercely, Zhou Xianyan defended strictly without losing a goal. The forwards waited for an opportunity to advance. Dai Linjing got the ball and drove forward with Chen Hongguang. As they approached the goal, Chen Hongguang was blocked by Cox. The defenders surrounded the ball with Dai and Chen, searching for each other, not knowing where to go. Center forward Dai, quick-witted and deft, pushed the ball out and kicked it into the net. In the first half, East China took the lead 2-1.</p>
<p>Leisch Scores Repeatedly</p>
<p>Who knew that disaster would come in the second half, one after another. In less than five minutes, Leisch broke through several barriers and charged in. After a dozen minutes, Leisch took a quick and powerful long shot from twenty yards away, putting the Navy ahead of East China 3-2. East China's situation became increasingly discouraging.</p>
<p>The Third Fatal Blow</p>
<p>In disappointment, good news suddenly came. Chen Jiaqiu sent the ball forward, and Chen Yutian charged forward on horseback. On the extreme left, Qian Jingyong got the ball in the corner. Without passing it back to the center, Cox and others rushed to defend. Chen Hongguang kicked it in, tying the score at 3-3. Disaster struck East China, and the situation remained critical. Leisch broke through the defenses again and delivered the third blow, sealing East China's fate. There were still five minutes left in the game.</p>
<h3>British Army Football Team Lincoln and Widdecombe's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Qingdao Men's and Women's Basketball Games</h3>
<p>Xiangtai Team Wins by a Landslide with 142 to 2</p>
<p>Shanghai Basketball Star Ms. Xi Jun Performs</p>
<p>Truly Amazing Skills Win Applause from the Audience</p>
<p>Qingdao Telegram: Ms. Xi Jun, who led the Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team on an expedition to Japan and the Northern Expedition to Jinbu, has a resounding reputation that has shaken the sports world at home and abroad. Ms. Xi joined the city's women's basketball game yesterday, the 12th, and all the ladies in the city rushed to see Ms. Xi's unique skills. Therefore, the stadium was immediately crowded and overwhelmed. The enthusiasm of all circles admiring Ms. Xi is evident. The men's and women's basketball games of the day are recorded separately below. (1) Men's Division (Xiangtai vs. United): Referee Zhao Huacheng blew the whistle to start the game. The athletes on both sides bravely competed for the lead and showed their abilities. As a result, Xiangtai team won a landslide victory with 142 to 2. (2) Women's Division (Feifei vs. Wende): After the men's division battle ended, the women's team continued to start. Ms. Xi Jun joined the Feifei team. At that time, the audience had surrounded the stadium tightly, and the atmosphere on the field was extremely tense. Referee Gu Yuanrong gave the order to attack because the time had come. Feifei team captain Xi Jun and Wende team captain Yuan Chengson each led their team members to compete. Just one minute into the game, Wende defender Pan Xiulan committed a technical foul, and Ms. Xi took the free throw. Her posture was beautiful, and she pushed the ball lightly with both hands. The ball went into the basket, taking the lead. She lived up to her reputation, and the audience applauded. Every time Ms. Xi got the ball, whether passing or shooting, she was skillful in every way. It was a pity that the two forwards were not effective in supporting her, and they missed many good opportunities. However, in the chaotic battle, Ms. Xi was able to score three goals single-handedly and make three free throws. Each goal was truly an amazing work of art. No wonder the Japanese devils were terrified when they saw it. However, the only regret was that Ms. Xi's spirit was not what it used to be, and it was difficult to support her alone. The response was not flexible, and her failure was expected. As a result, Wende won with 17 to 11.</p>

<h3>Financial: Gold Prices Plummet Last Week</h3>
<p>A Drop of Thirty-Six Taels and Six Mace: The gold standard market continued to fluctuate dramatically last week, with the downward trend far exceeding the previous one. Since the beginning of this month, it has repeatedly fallen by more than 110 taels, and the raging waves could not be contained. Suddenly, it has broken through the 600 tael mark, and the industry is at a loss and extremely panicked. There is a difference of more than 20 taels per day, and at least 10 taels above the board. From the beginning of the week at 628 taels, the next day a new low of 586.5 taels appeared, with a total of 41.5 taels. The total calculated drop was 36 taels and 6 mace. The reason is that the overseas silver market has soared, and British silver has actually exceeded 21 pence. However, American silver is very complex. Shanghai's exchange rate continued to rise by 3 points, and the domestic market also tended to loosen. There were many differences in the industry, but they still occupied short positions. As for the Northeast Japanese invaders, their aggression has intensified, and the League of Nations has not yet had any special good news in the closed meeting. The gold market is fluctuating vaguely around 600 taels. This year's swap was privately opened in advance on Saturday (14th), which was advanced by many parties. However, it was expected to open outside of 10 taels, but unexpectedly it only counted 4 or 5 taels, and the bulls were willing to sell. Then it quickly decreased to 2 or 3 taels, which was really unexpected. The reason is that although there is little spot goods, the silver is tight. How can there be the ability to collect cash? The amount of gold delivery notes is even less, only counting within 30,000 notes. However, in the future market situation, there may still be major turbulence. Yesterday (15th), the large notes rose again. Now the daily progress is extracted and recorded later.</p>
<p>No Day Without a Dangerous Situation: Monday (November 9) The large silver note retraced 2125, and American silver rose 375, first ordering no changes. The US dollar was listed as long 25, which is the exchange rate. The internals were loose, and the industry dumped. As for the gold market, it fell immediately, falling sharply by 16 taels and 4 mace, to 624 taels. The rumor was that the United States would recall its ambassador to Japan and implement an economic severance, which caused panic. Then it was 28 taels. Later, the storm was dangerous, and the strong drop was more than 10 taels, only 08 taels and 5 mace. Large households sold out, and in the afternoon, retail households replenished their short positions and turned upward, to 16 taels. The afternoon closed at 12 taels, and in the afternoon at 09 taels. At the opening, it was suddenly heard that Japan had withdrawn from the League of Nations, suddenly at 04 taels. With buying power, it once rose to 14 taels and 8 mace. The exchange market loosened, and it fell again to 06 taels. The closing price rose by 6 or 7 taels, totaling 12 taels. However, compared with the previous Saturday, it fell by 27 taels and 4 mace. There were 24 taels of volatility throughout the day. The next day, the large silver note increased by 1 penny 0625, and the silver price increased by 1 point 375, the first order increased by 3 points, and the domestic market also loosened. The gold market was because the international banking group had a proposal to stabilize the silver market, so the opening immediately fell by 9 taels, to 604 taels, then 4 taels and 5. After that, it frequently fell, and the sellers showed their courage. Foreign businessmen Qiao Rifu and Wu and others all sold out. It fell again by more than 10 taels, and suddenly saw a new low price of 586 taels and 5 mace. It was reported that the Black Province was defeated by the Japanese, and the buyers were active. At noon, 600 taels reappeared, totaling 02 and a half taels. At the closing, the opening price in the afternoon was 99 and a half taels. Later, it had been to 02 taels inside and outside of 600 taels. The closing price was still 596 taels and 8 mace, a continued drop of 16 taels and 2 mace. There was an 18 tael difference throughout the day. Since Wednesday, the large note has increased by another half penny, and American silver has increased by half point. Colleagues were asking to steal, and the spot gold opening price rose by 13 taels and 2 mace, totaling 610 taels. Because the private telegram silver price retraced by 2.75 more points, people's hearts were strengthened. After that, it rose to 25 taels, and then reduced to 17 taels. The noon closed at 21 taels and 5. People's hearts were erratic. The afternoon opened at 15 taels. Because the Dalian gang sold 1,000 notes according to the listing, it suddenly expected to rise, to 23 taels. However, there were mutual regressions in between. The closing price was 18 taels and 8 mace, a rebound of 22 taels compared to the previous day. There was a 16 tael increase and decrease that day, but it was elusive. The next day, the large note shrank by 8125 to 75, and the silver market shrank by 1.875. The first order suddenly changed, and the domestic market became hard. Each number dumped, but the Guang gang alone grabbed US dollars. The spot gold opening price went down by 6 taels and 3 mace, totaling 612 taels and 5 mace. Because the private telegram was only 375 smaller, people's hearts dropped. It continued to rise to 17 taels and 5 mace, and then the Dalian gang and others bought in. After that, it broke into 600 taels, totaling 98 taels and 5 mace. Because the American Silver Association re-proposed it, and there was news that India was buying silver, people's hearts softened. The noon closed at 601 taels. In the afternoon, the opening price was 05 taels and 5, and the Dalian gang bought in. Later, a storm suddenly arose, and the Indian exchange reported greatly, and the Japanese bandits' riots were even more fierce. Therefore, a new price of 86 taels and 5 appeared for the second time. At the closing price, it was 93 taels and 8 mace again. Someone pursued, and the retraction was 26 taels smaller than the previous day. The front and rear markets had a 31 tael rotation. The raging waves were frightening. The Dalian gang made a fierce advance of more than 4,000 notes, and the Guang gang more than 1,000 notes. On Friday, the large note rebounded 6875 to 625, the US silver increased 875, the first order initially increased by one penny, and then changed to shrinking by half a penny. The domestic market tended to be strong, and colleagues changed their positions. The spot gold initially rose by 12 taels and 7 to 606 taels and 5. It continued to fall to 600 taels, and then stepped up. There were rises and falls, often 10 taels. At noon, it was 18 taels and 5. The closing price was 18 taels, and the buying style was more intense. The exchange market was especially tight. The afternoon opened at 20 taels, then 21 taels. Then it went downstream to 15 and a half taels. The selling style was strong. Before long, the first order was changed to shrinking, then it was 19 taels. Later, rumors spread that the Northeast was tight again, and it was returned to 10 taels. The closing price was 13 taels and 7, a rebound of 20 taels and 9. There were 22 taels up and down throughout the day. On Saturday, the large silver note shrank by 3125, the silver price shrank by 875, the first order did not change, and the domestic market loosened. Chinese merchants reappeared. The gold market opened slightly to 2 taels and 2, for 611 taels and 5. Although the large note shrank, there was a large debt, and the footing was unstable. Later, it was slightly uneasy and had been to 14 taels and 5. At noon, it only counted 03 taels and 8 mace. Because the swap had been privately opened, the closing price was made to 10 and a half taels, a decrease of 9 taels and 9 compared to the previous day (according to the listing). There was a 10 tael and 7 difference in half a day. Now, the high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rates are listed separately later.</p>

<h3>Overseas Silver Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Both India and the Mainland are Buying</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and a telegram came from London saying that both India and the Mainland had made some purchases. Sellers were at a loss, and the market was calm. Although the large silver note has increased, the price of American silver has increased slightly. Therefore, there is no large drop in spot gold today. If the recent increase is 4375, it is 21 pence five six two five. The far period also increased by 4375 to 21 pence three seven five. A telegram was also received from New York that the price of American silver has increased slightly by 125. The spot is calculated as three corners and five and a half. The private telegram has increased by 25, and the market is firm and flat. The British exchange rate for the US has increased by 375 to three yuan seven corners seven points one two five.

<h3>Sunday Interest Rate Idle</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, and the money market news was also cold. The interest rate in the morning was 7 mace 2 points 4 li, and in the afternoon it was 7 mace 2 points 4 li 2 hao and a half. The result was similar to the previous day. The silver interest rate in the morning was 3 mace 5 points, and the same price in the afternoon. The foreign exchange bill made in the morning was 1.165 million, and in the afternoon it was 350,000. There were no transactions for banknotes in the morning. The money house Yang Gong and others collected and released more than 6.8 million, and the silver public single collected and released more than 47 million. The reason is that on the 15th of the month, this collection and release is not less than usual even on Sundays. Small money houses traded more than 300,000, and the collection and release of various remittance money was more than 500,000. The Jiangnan small ocean in the morning was 6 mace 5 points 1 li, and in the afternoon it was 6 mace 5 points 2 li. The transaction was 1,500 corners in the morning, and 4,000 corners in the afternoon.

The transaction was 75,000 corners in the morning, and 30,000 corners in the afternoon. Copper coins were still 380,000 thousand characters.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Peaceful Last Week</h3>
<p>Although more spot transactions of public bonds were opened last week, they were all scattered transactions, totaling only 58,000 yuan. Among them, the reorganization of the six equal parts of the salt tax for reorganization each accounted for about 10,000, and the others were only a few thousand yuan. The futures market was also sluggish, and the large households were more likely to wait and see than before. The attitude of those who generally operate securities trading was quite cold, so the market was also clearer than the previous week. The daily market popularity was always very idle. The daily transaction situation, except for Monday reaching 15 million, Tuesday about 8.4 million, and later days saw desolation, most days only 6 or 7 million yuan, Friday only opened 5 million and several million yuan. The total transaction for the week was 50 million yuan, a decrease of 17 million yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, the consolidated salt tax 20 customs was more. The consolidated tax was 5.665 million yuan for the November period, 3.265 million yuan for the December period, 5.915 million yuan for the November period of 20 customs, and 2.485 million yuan for the December period. The salt tax was 4.395 million yuan for the November period, and 3.495 million yuan for the December period. The demobilization of the 19 customs was second. The demobilization was 2.655 million yuan for the November period, and 3.74 million yuan for the December period. The 19 customs was 4.68 million yuan for the November period, and 1.435 million yuan for the December period. The remainder, such as the November period of 20 volumes was 3.015 million yuan, the December period was 1.49 million, the November period of 19 good deeds was 2.4 million, the December was 1.015 million yuan, and the demobilization was 1.565 million yuan for the November period and 715,000 yuan for the December period. Others, such as the reorganization of the six percent was 845,000 yuan, the 96 public bond was 810,000 yuan, the customs duty was 360,000 yuan, and the financial sector was 25,000 yuan. As for the changes in the prices of each bond in the week, the situation in the Northeast was still extremely serious. The Japanese were actively invading the Black Province, and the riots in Tianjin had not yet been quelled. The League of Nations had not taken any action, and the attitudes of various countries were chaotic. Although the domestic situation seemed to be slightly better, the general public, in view of the lack of change in the diplomatic situation, were worried that the war would eventually be inevitable, and were increasingly uninterested in bond investment. Large households were waiting and watching, and even retail households rarely entered and exited. Since there was no major difference between the buying and selling parties in the market, the prices remained in a revolving state from beginning to end. As a result, the spot prices of the 19 customs, 20 customs, and salt tax were slightly increased compared to the previous week, the futures of the 19 customs were also slightly firmer, and the others all retreated by about one yuan. Observing the situation of the bond market, although the ups and downs were very small throughout the past week, it is feared that this week will not be as peaceful as this. The League of Nations will reopen this week, and the diplomatic future will definitely have other changes, which will have a major impact on the securities market. However, what the trend will be, it is impossible to measure its changes. The statistics of the highs, lows, ups and downs of each bond price in the past week are listed in the following table.

<h3>Yarn and Flowers: The Yarn Market Was Extremely Active Last Week</h3>
<p>Actual Demand is Paused</p>
<p>The yarn market was unusually weak during the week, without any spirit of recovery. The Japanese invasion became more and more serious, and the war in the Black Province caused panic. The financial situation was extremely tight, and actual sales were suspended, without any excitement. As a result, the selling atmosphere was intense, and the market plummeted. Halfway through, a certain major merchant intended to buy in if it fell again in the near month, so the situation was slightly stabilized. However, the surrounding environment was poor, and the country was in trouble. Commerce suffered a major blow. How could there be a prosperous atmosphere? Therefore, the general trend is still scattered, but the bottom of the yarn is not thick. 52 or 3 taels may have a period of hovering. The price of spot yarn for each month fell by 3 or 4 taels compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Unstable Last Week</h3>
<p>Chinese Factories Order Tens of Thousands of Bales of Foreign Cotton Again</p>
<p>The cotton market has been quite unstable for a week. The trends of both American and Indian cotton were very weak, and the silver price was released, while the gold price was shortened, resulting in a particularly low calculation of foreign cotton silver. Compared with this cotton price, it is over 56.7 taels. This situation is rare in previous years. Therefore, each factory has purchased and set foreign cotton one after another. According to the customs report, there are actually imports every day. Therefore, the demand for this cotton has been completely encroached upon. However, a cotton merchant and the Ningbo gang and Hankou gang were able to have a short squeeze at the time of the large-scale import of foreign cotton, and their attitude was strong. Exploring their intentions, although foreign cotton is cheap, it cannot be delivered to the standard, and the delivery from each route is not strong. Therefore, they tighten this month and do not release. Therefore, the difference between the spot cotton price and the American cotton comparison is as high as 8 or 9 taels, creating a new low in the future. In short, for the time being, due to the lack of goods, it can still be established. According to the general trend, the future situation of this cotton is extremely dangerous. I am afraid there will be a drastic change. The spot cotton price fell 6 or 7 cents compared to the previous week. The American flower fell 25 pounds compared to the previous week. Each factory in this week has ordered American and Indian cotton, about tens of thousands of bales.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton All Plummeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to the Wall Street decline and increased selling pressure. Later, it slightly rebounded due to some short covering. Futures fell by 8 to 11 points, spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 8 to 9 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton weakened due to European exporters dumping, with Bengal and Oomra falling by 4.25 rupees, and Broach falling by 2.75 rupees, according to original telegraphic reports. (Dated the 14th)</p>

<h3>Rice Market Downriver Falls by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at Nantou, the source from the western route had about 40 ships. Because of the abundance of goods arriving, the transactions in stores on this street were sluggish. The market for top-grade Hou Xin Geng rice was stable, while the second grade weakened by two jiao. Although the arrival of kiln-grown Baige rice was accumulating, sales in this street were also sluggish, and the market price was stable. The foreign Du Jiansha shipping group bought 200 shi, and the price dropped by nearly a jiao compared to yesterday. The current sales of foreign rice were not smooth, and there were slight futures transactions, but the market remained mediocre.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market in Xin Zha became increasingly dull, and the buying interest was weak. The opening of trading in the morning had limited fluctuations, and the top-grade Western Xin rice weakened slightly by a jiao. The early and late rice on the wharf were unusually quiet, and the overall price fell by one or two jiao. Although the stock of Bai Ye rice was small, the situation was low. The price of Bian Yin Er Yuan liquor was firm, and the market was uniquely strong. The Du Jian guest group had some transactions, but the local city did not buy much, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was quiet due to the weekend, and there were no telegrams from the producing areas. The guild's trading was still depressed, and the market price continued to decline. At first, the asking price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was 6 taels and 9 qian, but there were no inquiries. Later, the high-quality goods were priced at 9 taels and 8 qian and a half, but ordinary goods were rarely accepted. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 9 taels 7 qian 2 and a half fen, with slight transactions, but the trend was still bleak. The trade in Taikoo sugar was relatively smooth, but the outflow of goods was quite high, and the market also declined. The price of B mark was 11 taels 5 qian to 4 qian and a half, DY mark was 11 taels 4 qian, HX mark was 11 taels 3 qian, and HM mark was 11 taels 0 qian 9 qian. The market also weakened later. Looking at the sugar market as a whole, there is no hope of a turnaround for the time being, but the market inventory is not high, and the additional tax is about to be implemented, and the activities of removal in various places may be active, so the return of the wind is also expected.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thin Tinplate Can Be Shipped Today</h3>
<p>The thin tinplate, which has been out of stock for many days, arrived the day before yesterday. However, due to the continuous rain these days, the ship's hold has not been opened. Therefore, most purchasers are waiting. According to the guild's news yesterday, this batch of goods can be shipped today. It is said that the buying and selling of customers and retailers in the market will be lively today.</p>

<h3>Recollections from Dai Liang</h3>
<p>Z&gt;Yanzi</p>
<p>The year of Jiawu was after the start of the war. Wu Dacheng and Song Qing were ordered to lead troops and stationed outside the pass. At that time, the Japanese army did not dare to openly confront us, but instead disguised their secret agents and mixed them into the Qing camp to gather military intelligence. They used various tricks to achieve their goals. The capture of spies was often heard. Wei Guangtao, the head of the general affairs office, was experienced in military affairs and resourceful, and was relied upon by Wu. Every day, spies were captured who spoke fluent Chinese, making it almost impossible to distinguish them from Japanese. When Wei secretly interrogated them, even with torture, he could not find any clues. Weng Shouqi, an aide, suggested, "The Japanese wear wooden clogs from a young age. Examining their big toes will reveal the truth." Wei thought his words were reasonable. Upon examination, the truth became clear, and there were no mistakes. Song Qing's vanguard troops encountered the Japanese army and captured Japanese prisoners. A thorough search of their bodies revealed a Chinese map inside their military caps. The key defensive locations were clearly marked. After repeated questioning, they confessed that Japanese merchants who came to China to sell medicine all had military knowledge and secretly drew maps everywhere to prepare for military needs. It can be seen that their intentions were meticulous and they had long harbored different plans. The Japanese are truly cunning.</p>

<h3>Franklin (3)</h3>
<p>One of the Biographies of Little Apprentices</p>
<p>After Franklin left Boston and did business for a few years, he opened his own bookstore. There were no two prices for books sold in his store. I heard such a story. One day, a customer came to buy a book and asked:</p>
<p>"How much does this book cost?"</p>
<p>The apprentice at the counter said:</p>
<p>"Two dollars!"</p>
<p>The customer said:</p>
<p>"That's too expensive! How about one dollar and eighty cents?"</p>
<p>The apprentice said:</p>
<p>"The price has gone up now, it's two dollars and twenty cents."</p>
<p>The customer said:</p>
<p>"You just said two dollars, how come it's two dollars and twenty cents now?"</p>
<p>The apprentice said:</p>
<p>"It's two dollars and forty cents now."</p>
<p>The customer thought that the apprentice was deliberately overcharging him, so he argued with the apprentice. Franklin, the owner, came out from inside, and the customer questioned him why the price had increased by forty cents in a short time.</p>
<p>Franklin smiled and took the book and said to him:</p>
<p>"Time is money! Our store does not bargain. If you want to buy this book, give me two dollars."</p>
<h3>Poems by Feng Yong and Yang Yunshi</h3>
<p>— Yu Hou</p>
<p>Feng Yong recently came to Shanghai to petition the peace conference to unanimously resist foreign aggression. Yesterday, he went to Beijing to make the same petition. Those who saw him said that he was heroic and kind. They recalled Mr. Yang Yunshi of Jiangdong, who once wrote a poem to Feng, praising him as a remarkable person, and detailing his history. Therefore, I have excerpted it to inform those who want to know Feng's history. Yang's original text says: Feng Yong is the son of Feng Lingge, the former military governor of Rehe. He is young and has a remarkable spirit, heroic and upright, and has great ambitions. After his father's death, he used his huge inheritance to found Feng Yong University to educate talents. The school's principles are to respect Confucius and value morality, and its educational guidelines are based on filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Supplemented by five virtues and five precepts, its aim is to save those who are trapped and rescue the country. His ambition is unattainable, and his knowledge is even more unattainable. He is sober when everyone is drunk, and he has the power to help them. He is a remarkable person. This autumn, the Russians launched a large-scale invasion of our border areas. Feng then organized 300 students and went to the far border to assist in the war. Seeing his heroic feats, they were surprised and delighted. Who would say that we have no one? Therefore, I present two poems to send him on his long journey. The poem says: "Such a man has not lived in vain. The idea of a ten thousand-room mansion fills his heart. Among the many sons of generals, I love Feng Yong, unmatched in the world. The brave man sings aloud as he leaves the frontier. At the age of manhood, he presses his sword and pacifies the three borders. The spirit of Piao Yao remains. The Great Wall of the Northeast has two young men." (Returned Rhyme)</p>

<p>There is a kind of tree in Venezuela, South America. If you pierce the bark with a knife, a sweet liquid like milk will flow out. Chemical experts have analyzed it and said that the liquid contains more phosphorus and sugar than milk.</p>
<p>The manuscript of "Lycidas," a poem by the great English poet Milton, was personally revised by him. It is generally regarded by bibliophiles as one of the most valuable books in the world.</p>
<p>There are many large trees in the forests of Brazil, South America. You don't need to use knives and saws to cut them down, they will fall down by themselves. It turns out that many beetles bore a groove on the trunks of the trees. From then on, the groove gets deeper and deeper until the tree finally collapses. Many valuable trees in Brazil are destroyed by these insects every year.</p>

<h3>The Invasive Shops on Liaocheng Road in Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The brutal Japanese treat our country like Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, their policy of aggression, even in the smallest shops, contains the meaning of aggression. Their intention is to absorb our country's money on the one hand and cause internal chaos in our country on the other. In the Qingdao area, there are countless shops set up by the Japanese that contain aggressive policies. The area where the Japanese live in Qingdao is called Liaocheng Road. Japanese soldiers are stationed there, ostensibly to protect overseas Chinese, but in reality, it is to prevent our country's authorities from strictly prohibiting their activities and reducing their ability to invade our country. Therefore, Japanese residents of Liaocheng Road act lawlessly, and the Chinese people have no recourse. These kinds of invasive shops are roughly divided into four types: selling drugs and military equipment, brothels, and waiting houses. I will describe them separately below.</p>
<p>Those who sell drugs in our country are all Japanese rogues. They have everything from opium, heroin, morphine, to red pills. All of them are manufactured in Japan. The amount is quite alarming. The amount sold and transported to our country every year is about one million Japanese yen or more. There is a huge organization in Liaocheng Road that holds secret meetings to discuss the smuggling of drugs into our country. Their methods are excellent, and they use the Jiaoji Railway as a protective charm. Although the Shandong authorities often make seizures, they can never find the main smuggling location. These rogues who sell drugs are all soldiers in times of emergency. They are so-called local soldiers.</p>
<p>The sale of military equipment to our country is intended to supply bandits and unprincipled people, so that they can disrupt our country's law and order and rot the local areas. As a result, the corner of Eastern Lu is known throughout the country for bandits and thieves, which is supplied by the Japanese. Moreover, the equipment that the Japanese sell to the bandits is what their country considers to be inapplicable, but in our country, it is still a fine weapon.</p>
<p>Brothels and waiting houses seduce our country's ambitious young people, causing them to lose their patriotic will. When they see our country's patriotic young people, they will use various methods to confuse them, so that they cannot serve the motherland. If a prostitute becomes pregnant, she will immediately return to her country. Therefore, no pregnant Japanese prostitutes have ever been seen. The Japanese population is far less than that of our country. This move is to increase the population of the motherland and is also a kind of aggression.</p>
<p>All of these things seem very small at first, but you don't know that once there is a change, their power in China cannot be insulted. The Liaodong incident can be seen as a clue. They are clear about our country's terrain and customs. At a time when the brutal Japanese ambitions are exposed, how can we ignore them because they are small?</p>
<h3>The Invention of Tailless Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In modern times, science is developing rapidly. Various war weapons have been invented one after another. People say that if a second world war were to unfortunately happen, the combat power of various countries would not be in the navy and army, but in the air force. This statement is true. The airplane is not only a convenient means of transportation, but also an important tool of war. European and American countries have been improving the manufacture of airplanes, and various new types of airplanes have been invented one after another. Recently, Germany has invented tailless airplanes. A test flight has been conducted at the Berlin Tempelhof airfield. The fastest speed can reach 96 miles per hour. The engine has 28 horsepower. Its strength can be seen. The inventor is Alexander Lippich, a famous figure in the German aviation science community. In his mind, the invention of tailless airplanes is a major advancement in flight technology. It can prove the special development of aviation strength. He also said that the wings used for passenger airplanes in the future will definitely be enlarged, and the small wings used today will be eliminated in the future. The tailless airplane has been successfully developed through his efforts. However, he still plans to invent a giant-wing airplane with wider seats for passengers. It is said that this kind of airplane is very economical and most suitable for the transportation of goods. However, in the initial stage of manufacturing, the first step should be to build a full-wing airplane. The second step is to manufacture according to the plan. After the test is successful, the engine can be installed and the voyage can begin. As for the recently invented tailless airplane, it is named "Hermann Köhl" because this person donated money to promote the non-stop flight across the Atlantic. Therefore, his name is used to commemorate him. According to recent test flights, this small airplane is only three feet high and can rise to an altitude of 14,000 feet. The cost is only US$1,700. The distance between the left and right wings is 42 feet.</p>
<h3>Continuing My Discussion on Enterprise</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Some say that it is not easy to raise funds to organize a company. Moreover, those who want to start a business with a small capital often do so for the sake of finding a job for themselves. Suppose they invest in a company organized by others and also request a position, it may not be possible. Moreover, it is also uncertain whether the company is reliable. If there is no clear and true knowledge, it is also a vague matter. If it goes bankrupt, then both the capital and the interest will be lost. It is better to operate a small business and control the power yourself. I say this is true. If you can operate a small business and control the power to win, you don't have to rely on others. However, if you have no experience yourself, and all facilities and plans rely on the people you hire, then the danger is great. It is like a blind person riding a blind horse, and asking a blind person for directions, then you will definitely fall into a deep pool and endanger your life. It can be asserted. Therefore, Xu thinks that it is not appropriate to invest a certain amount and also request a position as mentioned above. For example, if you invest 1,000 or 2,000 and request a position, then a company with a capital of 100,000 must be able to accommodate at least 50 people, including the shareholders themselves or those recommended by them. Whether they can do the job is not to be discussed for the moment, but the salaries of these 50 people, assuming that each person is 25 yuan, then the annual salary will be 15,000 yuan. The budget is only 20,000, leaving only 5,000. Just talking about the rent, the cost of accommodating the dormitories of these 50 people and their tea, water, and electricity is probably already difficult. Moreover, it is most difficult to make the shareholders and those recommended by them smooth and even. It is impossible to have three dukes in one country, let alone a group of dragons without a head, each with a contemptuous view. This is inevitable in the situation, so its failure is certain. How can you expect it to succeed? There is only one method that is quite feasible. Assuming that you invest 2,000, identify a certain factory's product that is easy to sell. Then, pay the factory as a deposit or buy its shares and use the share capital as collateral. Then, get 2,000 yuan worth of goods from the factory and sell them in a place that you are familiar with. Then, it is equivalent to having a factory with a capital of 2,000 in an instant. The goods have already been shipped, and they have already established a reputation. You don't have to advertise yourself, and you can enjoy the commission. If you get 2,000 yuan worth of goods, release 1,000, and store 1,000 in the warehouse, and divide the sales stores into 10 stores, each store only sells 5 yuan per day, then you will get monthly sales of 1,500 yuan. At a 5% commission, you can get 75 yuan. On the one hand, there is a share capital of 2,000 yuan attached to the company, and you can still get dividends. Assuming it is a deposit, you can get 200 yuan a year at 1%. Adding the commission, the annual income can be 1,100 yuan. Even if you hire one person to help and pay them 300 yuan a year, you can still get an annual income of 800 yuan, which is equivalent to a 40% profit. This kind of method, all the factories that Xu manages can accommodate it, and it is not surprising. It is safe for both parties and is more stable than any other method. If you set up your own factory and make your own product, it is still unknown whether it can be sold on the market when it is successful. Even if it can be sold, you have to rely on yourself for everything inside and outside. Let alone the hard work, whether your ability is sufficient is a big question. If it is the above method, then there are only 10 parties to deal with, all in front of you. The amount of money released to each store is only 100 yuan. Even if 5 stores go bankrupt in one year, you can still get a surplus of 300 yuan. Even if the invested capital is reversed by the superior, however, you pay money with one hand and take the goods with the other. After paying 2,000 capital, you have already taken 2,000 yuan worth of goods, which is enough to offset the loss. It is just that the interest is not available. Isn't it much more stable than an empty piece of paper? And in the factory, the goods that have been sent out have already received the cash first, even if they never come back, they will not suffer the loss of the royal account. Therefore, I think it is the quickest way to success. Other than this, if you want to be able to profit without learning, then a hundred thoughts cannot come up with a single idea. I am sorry that I cannot make a perfect plan. Therefore, I have left many recent letters unanswered. I am writing this in lieu of a reply. Please do not laugh at me for being a bore.

<p>(Attached White) On the Enterprise Talk of October 10, line 11, "if it is a factory" is mistaken for "if it is a name." Also, in the 5th line, "advertising and so on" is assumed to be (20 characters short line 20 lines) and omitted as 20 short lines. Also, the publication fee is found to be 4 jiao per line. Xu mistakenly remembered it as 4 jiao and a half. Consolidated and corrected.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Comes to Shanghai Again (18)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes and looked closer, and indeed there were two Wen Kui Zhai shops. Moreover, they were both old shops; both claiming to be the original founders; each shop was occupied by a young clerk. The country bumpkin felt strange again. Were these two Wen Kui Zhai shops one and the same? Or were they two different shops? And were they two shops opened right next to each other? If you sell that kind of confectionery; and I sell that kind of confectionery; wouldn't it be better if the two Wen Kui Zhai shops merged together? Why was it necessary to separate and become two shops? Since they both used the Wen Kui Zhai signboard, it was probably a signboard passed down from their ancestors, so they said they were old shops, so they said they were the original founders. Everyone worshipped the same ancestor, so why was it necessary to confront each other?</p>
<p>The country bumpkin harbored a spirit of reconciliation, and first walked towards the Wen Kui Zhai shop on the east side. The clerk thought he was there to buy something, and stood up to greet him.</p>
<p>"Excuse me: are your two Wen Kui Zhai shops one and the same? Or are they two different shops?"</p>
<p>The clerk originally wanted to ignore him. But on second thought: he came to ask whether they were one shop or two, maybe he bought the wrong thing and wanted to exchange it. Maybe he had specified one of our two shops to buy a certain kind of confectionery. Therefore, he said vaguely:</p>
<p>"We are considered one shop, and we are considered two shops."</p>
<p>"How can you be both one shop and two shops?" the country bumpkin asked in pursuit.</p>
<p>"We are originally one family, but two branches, so we can say we are one shop, and we can say we are two shops. Why are you asking?"</p>
<p>The clerk was getting a little annoyed.</p>
<p>"Then since you are one family, why don't you merge?"</p>
<p>"Because we were involved in a lawsuit before."</p>
<p>"I advise you, since you are one family, you should merge. Why don't you hold a peace and unification conference, work together, and merge the two storefronts together. Just let everyone give in a little bit."</p>
<p>The Wen Kui Zhai clerk thought: Is this country old man a madman? He walked up, and I thought he was going to buy some confectionery, but who knew he would interfere in our owner's one-shop or two-shop matter. This is a decades-old antique account of theirs, and the shop has been open for many years. Could this country bumpkin be some senior elder of our shop owner? If not, then he is a madman, we don't need to pay attention to him.</p>
<p>The clerk stopped paying attention to him and greeted another customer.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin thought: A mediator has to deal with both sides. Since that side ignored him, he went to this side.</p>
<p>He turned around and walked towards the shop on the west side. A clerk of about the same age as the one next door was standing inside the counter.</p>

<h3>Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Wenqing</p>
<p>A wealthy Guangdong businessman opened a large hotel in a bustling city in the East Indies. Their business cards and hotel brochures all stated a policy of giving preferential treatment to impoverished compatriots stranded overseas. They even specially equipped third-class rooms as reception areas. In mid-July, I also became a patron of their third-class rooms because I had to wait for the sailing date of the Chinese sea vessel and had no choice but to decide to stay in the third-class room for five days.</p>
<p>The weather was extremely hot, the scorching heat of the equator. I almost didn't have the courage to go out and bid a final farewell to this city I was about to leave. I just sat quietly in the room all day, fanning myself and watching, or watching the hands of the watch on my left wrist, ticking away quickly second by second.</p>
<p>In the room next door, every morning, evening, and late at night, there would be a burst of trembling violin strings, rippling in the lonely air... heroic, melancholy, desolate, clear and melodious. This subtle sound was too far removed from the lives of the vulgar city dwellers. It seemed to be a tune of self-playing and self-interpreting, self-lamenting and self-comforting.</p>
<p>The owner of the violin – his door was always tightly locked during the day. Occasionally, for very short periods, the door would be open. Sometimes, when passing by his door, I would occasionally turn my head and see a person, neither tall nor short, standing in the corner of the window frame, his left hand holding a pale yellow palette, his right hand gripping a paintbrush, concentrating intently on painting his own blood and life onto the canvas stroke by stroke. Sometimes, I would also see him holding a pen, buried in his desk, writing rustlingly on white paper, but no one knew what he was writing. Although I had seen this figure working, playing the violin, singing and humming in a room, I had never paid attention to his face.</p>
<p>The weather had been extremely hot and dry for the past few days. My tired soul was also tormented by the heat demon and felt exhausted. Not long after dusk, I turned off the dim light, took off my clothes, and went to bed.</p>
<p>A wisp of dream soul had already entered the land of sleep in a daze. Later, I was awakened by a burst of quavering violin strings from the room next door. I lay softly in bed, quietly listening to this trembling sound, feeling it was even more sorrowful than usual, as if it was drawing out strands of wandering and bitter emotions from the grave of my heart. I almost couldn't bear to listen anymore, and I also felt the desolation of my wandering life, but I couldn't fall back asleep. So, I slipped out of bed, turned on the electric light, and began to write a short essay – picking up the traces of my wandering life in a foreign land. When I finished writing a sheet of paper, the sound of the violin next door had stopped, as quiet and silent as a solemn dead zone. After a while, I faintly heard the owner of the violin let out a soft sigh, and then, like a madman, he said to himself, "Wanderer of the world, go home! Alas, how can I go home..."</p>
<p>It's really strange, the voice of this person, it seemed very familiar to me. At that time, I stopped writing and was silent for a while. Yes, that's right, I had heard this person's voice before. It seemed to be two years ago, on the banks of West Lake, there was a group of "Bohemians," wandering like vagabonds. They were all playing dramas on the stage of life. I remember in a play called "Unfinished Masterpiece," there was a young man playing a choirboy and a prisoner number six who had been sentenced to death. "Sir, why don't you use your imagination to complete this great painting?" "Wesgy, another cup." His face represented the "good" and "evil" of the world. The sound he made, which was different from heaven and hell, was deeply imprinted in my mind. I was almost certain that the owner of the violin next door was the young man who played the choirboy and prisoner number six in "Unfinished Masterpiece." I thought, if I happened to meet an acquaintance in a foreign country far away, that would be a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>The next morning, I really wanted to see if the owner of the violin was the one who played the role representing "heavenly charity" and "hellish evil" in the "Unfinished Masterpiece" on the banks of West Lake. When I opened the door, little did I know that he had already slipped out of my dream.</p>
<p>When the setting sun was slanting westward and the golden light was spilling over the tops of the coconut trees, I wandered around the alley for a while, and then leaned alone on the railing to enjoy the cool air. From afar, I saw a young man in a gray suit, carrying a newspaper package, which seemed to contain books and manuscripts. His right hand held a small package of tender green banana leaves. At a glance, I knew it was a package of coarse yellow rice, which intellectuals could buy for three cents. He gradually approached, hesitating between the first and second floors, looking as if he wanted to ask me something, but he didn't dare to be presumptuous. His face, which represented "good" and "evil," was very familiar to me at first sight. So, I asked him in advance,</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu, how did you come to be here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Liu, when did you come? And where are you going now? It's such a coincidence that we met in such a remote place!"</p>
<p>"I've been here for more than a year, and now I'm going back to China. What about you, sir?"</p>
<p>"Me? Since performing in the play on the banks of West Lake, I have been wandering with my violin – it seems to be my soul – following me all over the world. I have been wandering in this lonely and dark country for almost two years. The long days of wandering abroad have made my longing for my country and homeland extremely intense. Because my whereabouts are as drifting as duckweed, my former friends have also lost contact with me. I am lonelier than a mule in the desert! Where are Mr. Deng and Mr. Bai now?"</p>
<p>"As for them, now their whereabouts are unknown, like the wind."</p>
<p>"After you return to China, if you meet Mr. Deng and Mr. Bai, please convey to them that they have a poor, useless friend who has seen enough of egg-like stares and heard enough of poisonous voices in a cold and lonely country. I originally wanted to go back, but..."</p>
<p>"Sir, why don't you find something to do?"</p>
<p>"Find something to do? That's simply not an easy task. The schools run by those illiterate, blind merchants only take in those sycophantic teachers who wag their tails and beg for mercy. I would rather starve to death than do that kind of flattering thing. I have also run to many places, but I have been hitting walls everywhere, almost breaking my head. They, like the village women and old grannies in China, don't understand me at all, saying that I am a low-class rogue who plays foreign fiddles and draws muddled foreign eggs. This kind of rogue is someone who has been abandoned by the high officials and big shots in China. They almost certainly think that my personality is not even worth one ten-thousandth of the value of those language teachers who teach big dogs and puppies. Therefore, I no longer dream of eating the teacher's rice."</p>
<p>"Sir, do you have any friends here?"</p>
<p>"Those elementary school teachers and blind merchants, none of them look up to me. Fortunately, there is a Dutch filmmaker who is very understanding of me. He says that the eggs I draw, stroke by stroke, deeply conceal the disharmonious colors of humanity and the depression of the youth of the twentieth century. This is a work full of life force. Moreover, he says that the strings of the violin I play are heroic and majestic, each section and each note can stir the blood of mankind and can also throb the pulse of mankind. He has encouraged me a lot of courage, and I also regard this sympathetic foreigner as my only confidant. Now, he is producing a great sound film, which contains many novel techniques. When they are producing it, I often go to visit continuously, and</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>also, I bring a notebook and a transcript to record the important key points, tones, syllables, speed of sound recording and pronunciation, coordination of movements and syllables, methods of using machines... etc. I have almost stolen eight out of ten of their production techniques and methods. There are still two points that I have not mastered. Probably in a month, I can complete my work. This is also the only comfort I have gained from wandering overseas and suffering hunger for more than two years."</p>
<p>"Sir, your success is the success of China's film art cause. I hope that after you complete this great work, you will return as soon as possible and vigorously revitalize China's dormant film industry to glorify the motherland."</p>
<p>"That's what I originally thought, planning to return to China in September, but the return journey is still uncertain..."</p>
<p>"Sir, you haven't worked here for two years, how have you been supporting yourself? If you don't have money to return to China, then will you be stranded in a foreign land for a long time? I think, sir, it's better to find a way to go back. Although Chinese society is dark, at least it is much brighter than a colony under the oppression of imperialists, right?"</p>
<p>"Why don't I want to go back? As for the situation of my life these two years, sometimes I use the paintbrush and take the time to write a little manuscript and send it to the newspaper office. However, the remuneration for the manuscripts of poor, wandering literati is very meager in that organ representing capitalist merchant advertisements and reporters. If you write two thousand words, excluding punctuation marks and spaces, you can only count as one thousand words in actual numbers. If it is published, you can go to the newspaper office to collect two and a half yuan. If you take a horse-drawn carriage to pick it up, the two and a half yuan will be completely offset. Fortunately, my legs are still strong. Every time I write a text, I have never failed to get paid. The fruits here are very cheap. Five cents can buy more than two pounds of bananas, and bananas are very filling. Therefore, I mostly live a banana life here. Sometimes, I also have to buy a package of coarse yellow rice for three cents to fill my stomach."</p>
<p>As he said this, he raised the small package of fresh, oily green banana leaves he was holding in his hand for me to see, and seemed to show an embarrassed expression, gave me a slight bitter smile, nodded slightly, and then turned sideways and walked to the room next door that was deeply hidden with the ghost of the violin. He gently closed the door, and the inside was quiet and silent. It was probably that the hungry ghosts were making a famine in his stomach. I guessed that he must be quietly eating the package of cold yellow coarse rice, quietly living his artistic life as an artist.</p>

The price is cheap, the navigation consumption is also saved, and its active parts can also be interchanged with the Avro (621) standard flight trainer. It can be said to be the most economical aircraft.</p>
<p>The Avro (626) and the Avro (621) are mostly similar except for the fuselage. Their wings, tails, undercarriage, engine mounts and other active parts are the same and can be interchanged.</p>
<p>The fuselage structure of the Avro (626) is suitable for installing the following military equipment for various training applications: (1) Offensive shooting (fixed pilot's gun), (2) Defensive shooting (observer's gun), (3) Bombing, (4) Radio, (5) Aerial photography, (6) Driving, (7) Flight training (including night and blind flying). The above military equipment for various training applications will be described in detail later. What should be noted is that various trainings are independent of each other, and the two cannot be carried out at the same time. Once a job is completed, all related equipment must be completely unloaded, and then the equipment for the second job can be installed.</p>
<p>The replacement of equipment cannot be completed in a few minutes. From a practical point of view, a senior flight training school must have several Avro (626) aircraft, each equipped with a certain type of equipment, so that it can cope with it easily. Although the replacement of equipment can be completed in a short time, about two hours is enough.</p>
<p>The Avro (626) is equipped with all the necessary parts for installing various training applications of military equipment. Therefore, the equipment used is specially designated, so that the necessary parts can be standardized, and then there is no difficulty in installing various military equipment.</p>
<p>Due to the installation of various different equipment, the center of gravity of the aircraft also varies accordingly. However, the Avro (626) can be completely controlled freely in any environment. Its tail does not require special adjustment. Just turn the handwheel in the pilot's cabin, and the fuselage can automatically enter the adjusted state. When the Avro (626) is equipped with an observer's gun, the center of gravity is at the rear of the fuselage. After eight rotations, the machine takes off halfway through the ninth rotation.</p>
<p>Fuselage Structure The fuselage is made of welded steel pipes, which is extremely strong and has many advantages. It is extremely rich in absorbing shocks in the event of danger, and it is easy to repair. The difference between the fuselage of the Avro (626) and the fuselage of the Avro (621) is that it has three cabins. The rear cabin is attached with a tower, so that a rotating gun ring can be installed when needed. However, the Avro (626) has never been used as a three-seater aircraft. Its rear seat is designed for observers to use for training purposes. The gun is used, or it is used to install cameras or radios.</p>
<p>Main wing and aileron The main wing is made of metal, with steel wire rods and aluminum ribs, wrapped in painted fabric. Inspection and repair are extremely convenient. The aileron is a matching type. The N-shaped middle wing struts are made of steel pipes. If necessary, Hanlian Lipiqi Silaotz can be attached to the top wing, so that it can automatically lock together. The lock is controlled by the pilot's cabin.</p>
<p>Wheel feet The wheel feet have extremely wide wheel tracks and are separated from each other. There is no transverse wheel axle. Its shock absorber is a Uliwu type, attached with solid rubber. The entire design is to prevent the fuselage from being damaged as a result of repeated bad descents. However, trainees can still detect bad descents so that they can know where their mistakes are.</p>
<p>Weight The basic weight of the empty aircraft includes the usual flight instruments, including two oil pressure gauges, two oil temperature gauges, two air speed indicators, two cross levelers, two altimeters, two timers, two rotation indicators, two rotation indicator boxes, two Kaijias type paint tools, two ignition switches, two engine switches, and two Sutton type straps, totaling one thousand seven hundred and seventy-three pounds. Various training fixed load││pilot's weight including parachute one hundred and ninety pounds, trainee's weight including parachute one hundred and ninety pounds, petroleum (thirty gallons) two hundred and twenty-eight pounds, oil (three gallons) thirty pounds totaling six hundred and thirty-eight pounds. The basic weight of the aircraft plus people and fuel totals two thousand four hundred and eleven pounds.</p>
<p>(1) Offensive Shooting (Pilot's Gun) Basic weight two thousand four hundred and eleven pounds, special equipment, adjusted rear seat, rear controller, floor, one Vick gun (three another number three), one hundred bullets, Olardi type sight, totaling ninety-three pounds, totaling two thousand five hundred and four pounds.</p>
